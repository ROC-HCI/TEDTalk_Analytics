VSleep.
p5
aVIt's something we spend about a third of our lives doing,
p6
aVbut do any of us really understand what it's all about?
p7
aa(lp8
VTwo thousand years ago, Galen,
p9
aVone of the most prominent medical researchers
p10
aVof the ancient world,
p11
aVproposed that while we're awake,
p12
aVour brain's motive force, its juice,
p13
aVwould flow out to all the other parts of the body,
p14
aVanimating them but leaving the brain all dried up,
p15
aVand he thought that when we sleep,
p16
aVall this moisture that filled the rest of the body
p17
aVwould come rushing back,
p18
aVrehydrating the brain
p19
aVand refreshing the mind.
p20
aVNow, that sounds completely ridiculous to us now,
p21
aVbut Galen was simply trying to explain
p22
aVsomething about sleep
p23
aVthat we all deal with every day.
p24
aVSee, we all know based on our own experience
p25
aVthat when you sleep, it clears your mind,
p26
aVand when you don't sleep,
p27
aVit leaves your mind murky.
p28
aVBut while we know a great deal more about sleep now
p29
aVthan when Galen was around,
p30
aVwe still haven't understood why it is that sleep,
p31
aVof all of our activities, has this incredible
p32
aVrestorative function for the mind.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo today I want to tell you about
p35
aVsome recent research
p36
aVthat may shed new light on this question.
p37
aVWe've found that sleep may actually be
p38
aVa kind of elegant design solution
p39
aVto some of the brain's most basic needs,
p40
aVa unique way that the brain
p41
aVmeets the high demands and the narrow margins
p42
aVthat set it apart from all the other organs of the body.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo almost all the biology that we observe
p45
aVcan be thought of as a series of problems
p46
aVand their corresponding solutions,
p47
aVand the first problem that every organ must solve
p48
aVis a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel
p49
aVall those cells of the body.
p50
aVIn the brain, that is especially critical;
p51
aVits intense electrical activity uses up
p52
aVa quarter of the body's entire energy supply,
p53
aVeven though the brain accounts
p54
aVfor only about two percent of the body's mass.
p55
aVSo the circulatory system
p56
aVsolves the nutrient delivery problem
p57
aVby sending blood vessels to supply nutrients
p58
aVand oxygen to every corner of our body.
p59
aa(lp60
VYou can actually see it in this video here.
p61
aVHere, we're imaging blood vessels
p62
aVin the brain of a living mouse.
p63
aVThe blood vessels form a complex network
p64
aVthat fills the entire brain volume.
p65
aVThey start at the surface of the brain,
p66
aVand then they dive down into the tissue itself,
p67
aVand as they spread out, they supply nutrients
p68
aVand oxygen to each and every cell in the brain.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, just as every cell requires
p71
aVnutrients to fuel it,
p72
aVevery cell also produces waste as a byproduct,
p73
aVand the clearance of that waste
p74
aVis the second basic problem
p75
aVthat each organ has to solve.
p76
aVThis diagram shows the body's lymphatic system,
p77
aVwhich has evolved to meet this need.
p78
aVIt's a second parallel network of vessels
p79
aVthat extends throughout the body.
p80
aVIt takes up proteins and other waste
p81
aVfrom the spaces between the cells,
p82
aVit collects them, and then dumps them into the blood
p83
aVso they can be disposed of.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut if you look really closely at this diagram,
p86
aVyou'll see something
p87
aVthat doesn't make a lot of sense.
p88
aVSo if we were to zoom into this guy's head,
p89
aVone of the things that you would see there
p90
aVis that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain.
p91
aVBut that doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?
p92
aVI mean, the brain is this intensely active organ
p93
aVthat produces a correspondingly large amount of waste
p94
aVthat must be efficiently cleared.
p95
aVAnd yet, it lacks lymphatic vessels, which means that
p96
aVthe approach that the rest of the body takes
p97
aVto clearing away its waste
p98
aVwon't work in the brain.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo how, then, does the brain solve
p101
aVits waste clearance problem?
p102
aVWell, that seemingly mundane question
p103
aVis where our group first jumped into this story,
p104
aVand what we found
p105
aVas we dove down into the brain,
p106
aVdown among the neurons and the blood vessels,
p107
aVwas that the brain's solution
p108
aVto the problem of waste clearance,
p109
aVit was really unexpected.
p110
aVIt was ingenious,
p111
aVbut it was also beautiful.
p112
aVLet me tell you about what we found.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo the brain has this large pool
p115
aVof clean, clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid.
p116
aVWe call it the CSF.
p117
aVThe CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain,
p118
aVand wastes from inside the brain
p119
aVmake their way out to the CSF,
p120
aVwhich gets dumped, along with  the waste, into the blood.
p121
aVSo in that way, it sounds a lot like
p122
aVthe lymphatic system, doesn't it?
p123
aVBut what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste
p124
aVfrom inside the brain,
p125
aVthey don't just percolate their way randomly
p126
aVout to these pools of CSF.
p127
aVInstead, there is a specialized network of plumbing
p128
aVthat organizes and facilitates this process.
p129
aVYou can see that in these videos.
p130
aVHere, we're again imaging into the brain
p131
aVof living mice.
p132
aVThe frame on your left shows
p133
aVwhat's happening at the brain's surface,
p134
aVand the frame on your right shows
p135
aVwhat's happening down below the surface of the brain
p136
aVwithin the tissue itself.
p137
aVWe've labeled the blood vessels in red,
p138
aVand the CSF that's surrounding the brain
p139
aVwill be in green.
p140
aVNow, what was surprising to us
p141
aVwas that the fluid on the outside of the brain,
p142
aVit didn't stay on the outside.
p143
aVInstead, the CSF was pumped back into
p144
aVand through the brain
p145
aValong the outsides of the blood vessels,
p146
aVand as it flushed down into the brain
p147
aValong the outsides of these vessels,
p148
aVit was actually helping to clear away,
p149
aVto clean the waste from the spaces
p150
aVbetween the brain's cells.
p151
aVIf you think about it,
p152
aVusing the outsides of these blood vessels like this
p153
aVis a really clever design solution,
p154
aVbecause the brain is enclosed
p155
aVin a rigid skull
p156
aVand it's packed full of cells,
p157
aVso there is no extra space inside it
p158
aVfor a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system.
p159
aVYet the blood vessels,
p160
aVthey extend from the surface of the brain
p161
aVdown to reach every single cell in the brain,
p162
aVwhich means that fluid
p163
aVthat's traveling along the outsides of these vessels
p164
aVcan gain easy access to the entire brain's volume,
p165
aVso it's actually this really clever way
p166
aVto repurpose one set of vessels, the blood vessels,
p167
aVto take over and replace the function
p168
aVof a second set of vessels, the lymphatic vessels,
p169
aVto make it so you don't need them.
p170
aVAnd what's amazing is that no other organ
p171
aVtakes quite this approach
p172
aVto clearing away the waste from between its cells.
p173
aVThis is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut our most surprising finding
p176
aVwas that all of this,
p177
aVeverything I just told you about,
p178
aVwith all this fluid rushing through the brain,
p179
aVit's only happening in the sleeping brain.
p180
aVHere, the video on the left
p181
aVshows how much of the CSF is moving
p182
aVthrough the brain of a living mouse while it's awake.
p183
aVIt's almost nothing.
p184
aVYet in the same animal,
p185
aVif we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep,
p186
aVwhat we see is that the CSF
p187
aVis rushing through the brain,
p188
aVand we discovered that at the same time
p189
aVwhen the brain goes to sleep,
p190
aVthe brain cells themselves seem to shrink,
p191
aVopening up spaces in between them,
p192
aVallowing fluid to rush through
p193
aVand allowing waste to be cleared out.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo it seems that Galen may actually have been
p196
aVsort of on the right track when he wrote about
p197
aVfluid rushing through the brain
p198
aVwhen sleep came on.
p199
aVOur own research, now it's 2,000 years later,
p200
aVsuggests that what's happening is that
p201
aVwhen the brain is awake
p202
aVand is at its most busy,
p203
aVit puts off clearing away the waste
p204
aVfrom the spaces between its cells until later,
p205
aVand then, when it goes to sleep
p206
aVand doesn't have to be as busy,
p207
aVit shifts into a kind of cleaning mode
p208
aVto clear away the waste
p209
aVfrom the spaces between its cells,
p210
aVthe waste that's accumulated throughout the day.
p211
aVSo it's actually a little bit like how you or I,
p212
aVwe put off our household chores during the work week
p213
aVwhen we don't have time to get to it,
p214
aVand then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do
p215
aVwhen the weekend rolls around.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow, I've just talked a lot about waste clearance,
p218
aVbut I haven't been very specific
p219
aVabout the kinds of waste
p220
aVthat the brain needs to be clearing
p221
aVduring sleep in order to stay healthy.
p222
aVThe waste product that these recent studies
p223
aVfocused most on is amyloid-beta,
p224
aVwhich is a protein that's made in the brain all the time.
p225
aVMy brain's making amyloid-beta right now,
p226
aVand so is yours.
p227
aVBut in patients with Alzheimer's disease,
p228
aVamyloid-beta builds up and aggregates
p229
aVin the spaces between the brain's cells,
p230
aVinstead of being cleared away  like it's supposed to be,
p231
aVand it's this buildup of amyloid-beta
p232
aVthat's thought to be one of the key steps
p233
aVin the development of that terrible disease.
p234
aVSo we measured how fast amyloid-beta is cleared
p235
aVfrom the brain when it's awake
p236
aVversus when it's asleep,
p237
aVand we found that indeed,
p238
aVthe clearance of amyloid-beta
p239
aVis much more rapid from the sleeping brain.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo if sleep, then,
p242
aVis part of the brain's solution
p243
aVto the problem of waste clearance,
p244
aVthen this may dramatically change how we think
p245
aVabout the relationship between sleep,
p246
aVamyloid-beta, and Alzheimer's disease.
p247
aVA series of recent clinical studies
p248
aVsuggest that among patients
p249
aVwho haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease,
p250
aVworsening sleep quality and sleep duration
p251
aVare associated with a greater amount
p252
aVof amyloid-beta building up in the brain,
p253
aVand while it's important to point out
p254
aVthat these studies don't prove
p255
aVthat lack of sleep or poor sleep
p256
aVcause Alzheimer's disease,
p257
aVthey do suggest that the failure of the brain
p258
aVto keep its house clean
p259
aVby clearing away waste like amyloid-beta
p260
aVmay contribute to the development
p261
aVof conditions like Alzheimer's.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo what this new research tells us, then,
p264
aVis that the one thing that all of you
p265
aValready knew about sleep,
p266
aVthat even Galen understood about sleep,
p267
aVthat it refreshes and clears the mind,
p268
aVmay actually be a big part
p269
aVof what sleep is all about.
p270
aVSee, you and I, we go to sleep
p271
aVevery single night,
p272
aVbut our brains, they never rest.
p273
aVWhile our body is still
p274
aVand our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere,
p275
aVthe elegant machinery of the brain
p276
aVis quietly hard at work
p277
aVcleaning and maintaining
p278
aVthis unimaginably complex machine.
p279
aVLike our housework,
p280
aVit's a dirty and a thankless job,
p281
aVbut it's also important.
p282
aVIn your house, if you stop cleaning your kitchen
p283
aVfor a month,
p284
aVyour home will become completely unlivable
p285
aVvery quickly.
p286
aVBut in the brain, the consequences
p287
aVof falling behind may be much greater
p288
aVthan the embarrassment of dirty countertops,
p289
aVbecause when it comes to cleaning the brain,
p290
aVit is the very health and function
p291
aVof the mind and the body that's at stake,
p292
aVwhich is why understanding these
p293
aVvery basic housekeeping functions of the brain today
p294
aVmay be critical for preventing and treating
p295
aVdiseases of the mind tomorrow.
p296
aa(lp297
VThank you.

VSo, what I'm going to do is
p5
aVjust give you the latest episode of India's \u2014
p6
aVmaybe the world's \u2014 longest running soap opera,
p7
aVwhich is cricket.
p8
aVAnd may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.
p9
aVIt's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:
p10
aVIt's got love, joy, happiness,
p11
aVsadness, tears, laughter,
p12
aVlots of deceit, intrigue.
p13
aVAnd like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years
p14
aVwhen the audience interest changes.
p15
aVAnd that's exactly what cricket has done.
p16
aVIt's jumped 20 years
p17
aVinto 20-over game.
p18
aVAnd that's what I'm going to talk about,
p19
aVhow a small change
p20
aVleads to a very big revolution.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut it wasn't always like that.
p23
aVCricket wasn't always this
p24
aVspeed-driven generations game.
p25
aVThere was a time when you played cricket,
p26
aVyou played timeless test matches,
p27
aVwhen you played on till the game got over.
p28
aVAnd there was this game in March 1939
p29
aVthat started on the third of March
p30
aVand ended on the 14th of March.
p31
aVAnd it only ended because the English cricketers
p32
aVhad to go from Durban to Cape Town,
p33
aVwhich is a two-hour train journey,
p34
aVto catch the ship that left on the 17th,
p35
aVbecause the next ship wasn't around for a long time.
p36
aVSo, the match was ended in between.
p37
aVAnd one of the English batsmen said, "You know what?
p38
aVAnother half an hour and we would have won."
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVAnother half an hour after 12 days.
p41
aVThere were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,
p42
aVso you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,
p43
aVso they all sat around making friends with each other.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:
p46
aVbecause we had about the same pace of life.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVThe Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?
p49
aVYou fought by day, then it was sunset,
p50
aVso everyone went back home.
p51
aVAnd then you worked out your strategy,
p52
aVand you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.
p53
aVThe only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was
p54
aVthat in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.
p55
aVPrinces patronize the game,
p56
aVnot because they love the game,
p57
aVbut because it was a means of ingratiating themselves
p58
aVto the British rulers.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,
p61
aVwhich was, all you needed was a plank of wood
p62
aVand a rubber ball, and any number of people
p63
aVcould play it anywhere.
p64
aVTake a look:
p65
aVYou could play it in the dump
p66
aVwith some rocks over there,
p67
aVyou could play it in a little alley \u2014
p68
aVyou couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;
p69
aVdon't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVYou could play it on the banks of the Ganges \u2014
p72
aVthat's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.
p73
aVOr you could play many games in one small patch of land,
p74
aVeven if you didn't know which game you were actually in.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVAs you can see, you can play anywhere.
p77
aVBut slowly the game moved on,
p78
aVyou know, finally.
p79
aa(lp80
VYou don't always have five days. So, we moved on,
p81
aVand we started playing 50-over cricket.
p82
aVAnd then an enormous accident took place.
p83
aVIn Indian sport we don't make things happen,
p84
aVaccidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.
p85
aVAnd we won this World Cup in 1983.
p86
aVAnd suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,
p87
aVand we played it virtually every day.
p88
aVThere was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut there was another big date.
p91
aV1983 was when we won the World Cup.
p92
aV1991,'92, we found a finance minister
p93
aVand a prime minister
p94
aVwilling to let the world look at India,
p95
aVrather than be this great country of intrigue
p96
aVand mystery in this closed country.
p97
aVAnd so we allowed multinationals into India.
p98
aVWe cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,
p99
aVand we got all the multinationals coming in,
p100
aVwith multinational budgets,
p101
aVwho looked at per-capita income
p102
aVand got very excited about the possibilities in India,
p103
aVand were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd there are only two vehicles in India \u2014 one real, one scripted.
p106
aVThe scripted one is what you see in the movies,
p107
aVthe real one was cricket.
p108
aVAnd so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,
p109
aVRavi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it
p110
aVall over the world.
p111
aVAnd Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.
p112
aVAnd so cricket started becoming big;
p113
aVcricket started bringing riches in.
p114
aVTelevision started covering cricket. For a long time
p115
aVtelevision said, "We won't cover cricket
p116
aVunless you pay us to cover it."
p117
aVThen they said, "OK,
p118
aVthe next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.
p119
aVThe next rights are sold for 612 million dollars."
p120
aVSo, it's a bit of a curve, that.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd then another big accident happened in our cricket.
p123
aVEngland invented 20 overs cricket,
p124
aVand said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."
p125
aVJust as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.
p126
aVThank God for them.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVAnd so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.
p129
aVIndia didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.
p130
aVBut we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.
p131
aVAnd then something very dramatic happened.
p132
aVWe got to the final, and then this moment,
p133
aVthat will remain enshrined forever,
p134
aVfor everybody, take a look.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Crowd cheering)
p137
aa(lp138
VThe Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnnouncer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!
p141
aVWhat a match for a Twenty20 final.
p142
aVIndia, the world champions.
p143
aV(Cheering)
p144
aVIndia, T20 champions.
p145
aVBut what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni
p146
aVgot it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.
p147
aVA massive, massive success:
p148
aVIndia, the world TT champions.
p149
aa(lp150
VHarsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.
p151
aVThe accident, of course, there, was that the batsman
p152
aVthought the bowler was bowling fast.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVIf he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,
p155
aVbut it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered
p156
aVthat we could be good at this game.
p157
aVAnd what it also did was
p158
aVit led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.
p159
aVIt was at a time when investment was coming in,
p160
aVIndia was feeling a little more confident about itself.
p161
aVAnd so there was a feeling that there was great pride
p162
aVin what we can do.
p163
aVAnd thankfully for all of us,
p164
aVthe English are very good at inventing things,
p165
aVand then the gracious people that they are,
p166
aVthey let the world become very good at it.
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aVAnd so England invented T20 cricket,
p169
aVand allowed India to hijack it.
p170
aVIt was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,
p171
aVwe just took it straight away, as is.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd so, we launched our own T20 league.
p175
aVSix weeks, city versus city.
p176
aVIt was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country \u2014
p177
aVthe only two areas in which India was very proud about
p178
aVtheir country, representing itself on the field.
p179
aVOne was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.
p180
aVThe other was Indian cricket.
p181
aVNow, suddenly we had to support city leagues.
p182
aVBut the people getting into these city leagues
p183
aVwere people who were taking their cues from the West.
p184
aVAmerica is a home of leagues. And they said,
p185
aV"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India."
p186
aVBut was India ready for it?
p187
aVBecause cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.
p188
aVIt was never promoted, it was never sold \u2014 it was organized.
p189
aVAnd look what they did with our beautiful, nice,
p190
aVsimple family game.
p191
aVAll of a sudden, you had that happening.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Music)
p194
aa(lp195
VAn opening ceremony to match every other.
p196
aVThis was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.
p197
aVThis was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month
p198
aVthan New Zealand's population twice over.
p199
aVSo, it was a different India.
p200
aVBut it was also a slightly more orthodox India
p201
aVthat was very happy to be modern,
p202
aVbut didn't want to say that to people.
p203
aVAnd so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.
p204
aVEveryone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Music)
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VThe new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.
p211
aVThey were not bureaucrats who were forced
p212
aVinto sport because they didn't actually love it;
p213
aVthese were people who ran serious companies.
p214
aVAnd so they started promoting cricket big time,
p215
aVstarted promoting clubs big time.
p216
aVAnd they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.
p217
aVI mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars
p218
aVbefore a ball was bowled,
p219
aV1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,
p220
aVand another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises
p221
aVthat were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,
p222
aVbut they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.
p223
aVBut what they were very good at doing
p224
aVwas making it very localized.
p225
aVSo, just to give you an example of how they did it \u2014
p226
aVnot Manchester United style promotion,
p227
aVbut very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Music)
p230
aa(lp231
VOf course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play."
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aVBut that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.
p234
aVAll along, if you wanted a young cricketer,
p235
aVyou picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,
p236
aVyour own city, and you were very proud
p237
aVof the system that produced those cricketers.
p238
aVNow, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot \u2014
p239
aVif Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,
p240
aVthey needn't go to Kalbadevi
p241
aVor Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,
p242
aVthey could go to Trinidad.
p243
aVThis was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world,
p244
aVwhere you can source from anywhere
p245
aVas long as you get the best product at the best price.
p246
aVAnd all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality
p247
aVthat you can source the best product for the best price
p248
aVanywhere in the world.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,
p251
aVovernight. And when he had to go back to represent
p252
aVthe West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?"
p253
aVHe said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today."
p254
aVWe said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave;
p255
aVit's about when do you have to reach there?"
p256
aVAnd so he said, "I've got to reach on date X."
p257
aVAnd they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one."
p258
aVSo, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,
p259
aVwent from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,
p260
aVsat in a private corporate jet \u2014 first refueling in Portugal,
p261
aVsecond refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aVNever would India have thought on this scale before.
p264
aVNever would India have said, "I want a player to play
p265
aVone game for me, and I will use a corporate jet
p266
aVto send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica
p267
aVto play a game."
p268
aVAnd I just thought to myself,
p269
aV"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?
p270
aVWe have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big."
p271
aa(lp272
VBut what this also did was it started
p273
aVmarrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,
p274
aVwhich is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.
p275
aVThere is cricket and the movies.
p276
aVAnd they came together because people in the movies
p277
aVnow started owning clubs.
p278
aVAnd so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.
p279
aVThey started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.
p280
aVAnd something very interesting happened.
p281
aVWe started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.
p282
aVAnd so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.
p283
aVAnd of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team \u2014
p284
aVas you will see on the clip that follows \u2014 if you did well,
p285
aVyou got a hug from Preity Zinta.
p286
aVSo that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look \u2014
p287
aVeveryone's watching Preity Zinta.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Music)
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.
p292
aVWe'd all seen matches in Kolkata,
p293
aVbut we'd never seen anything like this:
p294
aVShah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up
p295
aVfor Kolkata \u2014 not for India, but for Kolkata.
p296
aVBut take a look at this.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Music)
p299
aa(lp300
VAn Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer
p301
aVbecause they'd won in Kolkata.
p302
aVCan you imagine?
p303
aVAnd do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?
p304
aV(Applause)
p305
aV"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team."
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VBut I thought I'd take this opportunity \u2014
p310
aVthere's a few people from Pakistan in here.
p311
aVI'm so happy that you're here
p312
aVbecause I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?
p313
aVWe can play cricket together, we can be friends.
p314
aVSo thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Applause)
p317
aa(lp318
VThere was criticism too because they said,
p319
aV"Players are being bought and sold?
p320
aVAre they grain?
p321
aVAre they cattle?"
p322
aVBecause we had this auction, you see.
p323
aVHow do you fix a price for a player?
p324
aVAnd so the auction that followed
p325
aVliterally had people saying,
p326
aV"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player."
p327
aVThere it is.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Music)
p330
aa(lp331
VAuctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai.
p332
aVShane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.
p333
aa(lp334
VHB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day \u2014
p335
aVso 250 rupees for a test match,
p336
aVbut if you finish in four days you only got 200.
p337
aVThe best Indian players who played every test match \u2014
p338
aVevery one of the internationals, the top of the line players \u2014
p339
aVstandard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year.
p340
aVNow they were getting 500,000 for six days' work.
p341
aVThen Andrew Flintoff came by from England,
p342
aVhe got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said,
p343
aV"For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard,
p344
aVand I'm earning more than the footballers, wow."
p345
aVAnd where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.
p346
aVCould you have imagined that day would come?
p347
aVOne and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.
p348
aVThat's not bad, is it?
p349
aa(lp350
VSo, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.
p351
aVWhat India was doing, though, was benchmarking
p352
aVitself against the best in the world,
p353
aVand it became a huge brand.
p354
aVLalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.
p355
aVIPL became the biggest brand in India
p356
aVand, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa,
p357
aVand we had to start the tournament in three weeks.
p358
aVMove a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.
p359
aVBut we did it. You know why?
p360
aVBecause no country works as slowly as we do
p361
aVtill three weeks before an event,
p362
aVand nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.
p363
aa(lp364
V(Applause)
p365
aa(lp366
VOur population, which for a long time we thought was a problem,
p367
aVsuddenly became our biggest asset
p368
aVbecause there were more people watching \u2014
p369
aVthe huge consuming class \u2014
p370
aVeverybody came to watch the cricket.
p371
aVWe'd also made cricket the only sport in India,
p372
aVwhich is a pity, but in India every other sport
p373
aVpushes cricket to become big,
p374
aVwhich is a bit of a tragedy of our times.
p375
aa(lp376
VNow, this last minute before I go \u2014
p377
aVthere's a couple of side effects of all this.
p378
aVFor a long time, India was this country of poverty,
p379
aVdust, beggars,
p380
aVsnake charmers, filth,
p381
aVDelhi belly \u2014 people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.
p382
aVAnd, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.
p383
aVCricketers all over the world said,
p384
aV"You know, we love India. We love to play in India."
p385
aVAnd that felt good, you know?
p386
aVWe said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."
p387
aVCan you imagine, you've got the dollar on view
p388
aVand there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.
p389
aVThere's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,
p390
aVeverybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.
p391
aa(lp392
VRight so, finally,
p393
aVan English game that India usurped a little bit,
p394
aVbut T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.
p395
aVIf you want to take the game around the world,
p396
aVit's got to be the shortest form of the game.
p397
aVYou can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,
p398
aVor you can't take it all over the world.
p399
aVSo that's what T20 is doing.
p400
aVHopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger
p401
aVand hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.
p402
aa(lp403
VThank you very much. Thank you.

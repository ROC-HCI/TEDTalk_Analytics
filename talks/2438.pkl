VSo a while ago, I tried an experiment.
p5
aVFor one year, I would say yes to all the things that scared me.
p6
aVAnything that made me nervous, took me out of my comfort zone,
p7
aVI forced myself to say yes to.
p8
aVDid I want to speak in public?
p9
aVNo, but yes.
p10
aVDid I want to be on live TV?
p11
aVNo, but yes.
p12
aVDid I want to try acting?
p13
aVNo, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd a crazy thing happened:
p16
aVthe very act of doing the thing that scared me
p17
aVundid the fear,
p18
aVmade it not scary.
p19
aVMy fear of public speaking, my social anxiety, poof, gone.
p20
aVIt's amazing, the power of one word.
p21
aV"Yes" changed my life.
p22
aV"Yes" changed me.
p23
aVBut there was one particular yes
p24
aVthat affected my life in the most profound way,
p25
aVin a way I never imagined,
p26
aVand it started with a question from my toddler.
p27
aa(lp28
VI have these three amazing daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson,
p29
aVand Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as "honey."
p30
aVas though she's a Southern waitress.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
V"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup."
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VThe Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening
p39
aVwhen I was on my way somewhere, and I said, "Yes."
p40
aVAnd that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family.
p41
aVI made a vow that from now on,
p42
aVevery time one of my children asks me to play,
p43
aVno matter what I'm doing or where I'm going,
p44
aVI say yes, every single time.
p45
aVAlmost. I'm not perfect at it, but I try hard to practice it.
p46
aVAnd it's had a magical effect on me,
p47
aVon my children, on our family.
p48
aVBut it's also had a stunning side effect,
p49
aVand it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it,
p50
aVthat I understood that saying yes to playing with my children
p51
aVlikely saved my career.
p52
aa(lp53
VSee, I have what most people would call a dream job.
p54
aVI'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living.
p55
aVDream job.
p56
aVNo.
p57
aVI'm a titan.
p58
aVDream job.
p59
aVI create television. I executive produce television.
p60
aVI make television, a great deal of television.
p61
aVIn one way or another, this TV season,
p62
aVI'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours of programming to the world.
p63
aVFour television programs, 70 hours of TV \u2014
p64
aa(lp65
V(Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VThree shows in production at a time, sometimes four.
p68
aVEach show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.
p69
aVThe budget for one episode of network television
p70
aVcan be anywhere from three to six million dollars.
p71
aVLet's just say five.
p72
aVA new episode made every nine days times four shows,
p73
aVso every nine days that's 20 million dollars worth of television,
p74
aVfour television programs, 70 hours of TV,
p75
aVthree shows in production at a time, sometimes four,
p76
aV16 episodes going on at all times:
p77
aV24 episodes of "Grey's," 21 episodes of "Scandal,"
p78
aV15 episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder,"
p79
aV10 episodes of "The Catch," that's 70 hours of TV,
p80
aVthat's 350 million dollars for a season.
p81
aVIn America, my television shows
p82
aVare back to back to back on Thursday night.
p83
aVAround the world, my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages
p84
aVfor an audience of 30 million people.
p85
aVMy brain is global,
p86
aVand 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created
p87
aVand not just produced, so on top of everything else,
p88
aVI need to find time, real quiet, creative time,
p89
aVto gather my fans around the campfire
p90
aVand tell my stories.
p91
aVFour television programs, 70 hours of TV,
p92
aVthree shows in production at a time,
p93
aVsometimes four, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all over the world.
p94
aVYou know who else is doing that?
p95
aVNobody, so like I said, I'm a titan.
p96
aVDream job.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Applause)
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, I don't tell you this to impress you.
p101
aVI tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word "writer."
p102
aVI tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard,
p103
aVwhether you run a company or a country or a classroom
p104
aVor a store or a home,
p105
aVtake me seriously when I talk about working,
p106
aVso you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day,
p107
aVso you'll hear me when I say
p108
aVthat I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming.
p109
aVIt's all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat, no tears.
p110
aVI work a lot, very hard, and I love it.
p111
aa(lp112
VWhen I'm hard at work, when I'm deep in it,
p113
aVthere is no other feeling.
p114
aVFor me, my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air.
p115
aVIt is manning the troops. It is painting a canvas.
p116
aVIt is hitting every high note. It is running a marathon.
p117
aVIt is being Beyoncé.
p118
aVAnd it is all of those things at the same time.
p119
aVI love working.
p120
aVIt is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating
p121
aVand hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal
p122
aVand cruel and judicious,
p123
aVand what makes it all so good is the hum.
p124
aVThere is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good.
p125
aVA hum begins in my brain,
p126
aVand it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road,
p127
aVand I could drive it forever.
p128
aVAnd a lot of people, when I try to explain the hum,
p129
aVthey assume that I'm talking about the writing,
p130
aVthat my writing brings me joy.
p131
aVAnd don't get me wrong, it does.
p132
aVBut the hum \u2014
p133
aVit wasn't until I started making television
p134
aVthat I started working, working and making
p135
aVand building and creating and collaborating,
p136
aVthat I discovered this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum.
p137
aVThe hum is more than writing.
p138
aVThe hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug.
p139
aVThe hum is music. The hum is light and air.
p140
aVThe hum is God's whisper right in my ear.
p141
aVAnd when you have a hum like that,
p142
aVyou can't help but strive for greatness.
p143
aVThat feeling, you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost.
p144
aVThat's called the hum.
p145
aVOr, maybe it's called being a workaholic.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VMaybe it's called genius.
p150
aVMaybe it's called ego.
p151
aVMaybe it's just fear of failure.
p152
aVI don't know.
p153
aVI just know that I'm not built for failure,
p154
aVand I just know that I love the hum.
p155
aVI just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan,
p156
aVand I know that I don't want to question it.
p157
aa(lp158
VBut here's the thing:
p159
aVthe more successful I become,
p160
aVthe more shows, the more episodes, the more barriers broken,
p161
aVthe more work there is to do,
p162
aVthe more balls in the air,
p163
aVthe more eyes on me, the more history stares,
p164
aVthe more expectations there are.
p165
aVThe more I work to be successful,
p166
aVthe more I need to work.
p167
aVAnd what did I say about work?
p168
aVI love working, right?
p169
aVThe nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,
p170
aVthe troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum,
p171
aVthe hum, the hum.
p172
aVI like that hum. I love that hum.
p173
aVI need that hum. I am that hum.
p174
aVAm I nothing but that hum?
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd then the hum stopped.
p177
aVOverworked, overused,
p178
aVoverdone, burned out.
p179
aVThe hum stopped.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, my three daughters are used to the truth
p182
aVthat their mother is a single working titan.
p183
aVHarper tells people,
p184
aV"My mom won't be there, but you can text my nanny."
p185
aVAnd Emerson says, "Honey, I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand."
p186
aVThey're children of a titan.
p187
aVThey're baby titans.
p188
aVThey were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped.
p189
aVThe hum of the engine died.
p190
aVI stopped loving work. I couldn't restart the engine.
p191
aVThe hum would not come back.
p192
aVMy hum was broken.
p193
aVI was doing the same things I always did, all the same titan work,
p194
aV15-hour days, working straight through the weekends,
p195
aVno regrets, never surrender, a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits,
p196
aVfull hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.
p197
aVBut there was no hum.
p198
aVInside me was silence.
p199
aVFour television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time,
p200
aVsometimes four.
p201
aVFour television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time ...
p202
aVI was the perfect titan.
p203
aVI was a titan you could take home to your mother.
p204
aVAll the colors were the same, and I was no longer having any fun.
p205
aVAnd it was my life.
p206
aVIt was all I did.
p207
aVI was the hum, and the hum was me.
p208
aVSo what do you do when the thing you do,
p209
aVthe work you love, starts to taste like dust?
p210
aa(lp211
VNow, I know somebody's out there thinking,
p212
aV"Cry me a river, stupid writer titan lady."
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VBut you know, you do,
p217
aVif you make, if you work, if you love what you do,
p218
aVbeing a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter,
p219
aVbeing Bill Gates,
p220
aVif you simply love another person and that gives you the hum,
p221
aVif you know the hum,
p222
aVif you know what the hum feels like, if you have been to the hum,
p223
aVwhen the hum stops, who are you?
p224
aVWhat are you?
p225
aVWhat am I?
p226
aVAm I still a titan?
p227
aVIf the song of my heart ceases to play, can I survive in the silence?
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question.
p230
aVI'm on my way out the door, I'm late, and she says,
p231
aV"Momma, wanna play?"
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd I'm just about to say no, when I realize two things.
p234
aVOne, I'm supposed to say yes to everything,
p235
aVand two, my Southern waitress didn't call me "honey."
p236
aVShe's not calling everyone "honey" anymore.
p237
aVWhen did that happen?
p238
aVI'm missing it, being a titan and mourning my hum,
p239
aVand here she is changing right before my eyes.
p240
aVAnd so she says, "Momma, wanna play?"
p241
aVAnd I say, "Yes."
p242
aVThere's nothing special about it.
p243
aVWe play, and we're joined by her sisters,
p244
aVand there's a lot of laughing,
p245
aVand I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops.
p246
aVNothing out of the ordinary.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd yet, it is extraordinary,
p251
aVbecause in my pain and my panic,
p252
aVin the homelessness of my humlessness,
p253
aVI have nothing to do but pay attention.
p254
aVI focus.
p255
aVI am still.
p256
aVThe nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,
p257
aVthe troops, the canvas, the high note does not exist.
p258
aVAll that exists are sticky fingers
p259
aVand gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons
p260
aVand that song about letting go
p261
aVof whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VIt's all peace and simplicity.
p266
aVThe air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe.
p267
aVI can barely believe I'm breathing.
p268
aVPlay is the opposite of work.
p269
aVAnd I am happy.
p270
aVSomething in me loosens.
p271
aVA door in my brain swings open,
p272
aVand a rush of energy comes.
p273
aVAnd it's not instantaneous, but it happens, it does happen.
p274
aVI feel it.
p275
aVA hum creeps back.
p276
aVNot at full volume, barely there,
p277
aVit's quiet, and I have to stay very still to hear it, but it is there.
p278
aVNot the hum, but a hum.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd now I feel like I know a very magical secret.
p281
aVWell, let's not get carried away.
p282
aVIt's just love. That's all it is.
p283
aVNo magic. No secret. It's just love.
p284
aVIt's just something we forgot.
p285
aVThe hum, the work hum, the hum of the titan,
p286
aVthat's just a replacement.
p287
aVIf I have to ask you who I am,
p288
aVif I have to tell you who I am,
p289
aVif I describe myself in terms of shows
p290
aVand hours of television and how globally badass my brain is,
p291
aVI have forgotten what the real hum is.
p292
aVThe hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific.
p293
aVThe hum is joy-specific.
p294
aVThe real hum is love-specific.
p295
aVThe hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life.
p296
aVThe real hum is confidence and peace.
p297
aVThe real hum ignores the stare of history,
p298
aVand the balls in the air, and the expectation, and the pressure.
p299
aVThe real hum is singular and original.
p300
aVThe real hum is God's whisper in my ear,
p301
aVbut maybe God was whispering the wrong words,
p302
aVbecause which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan?
p303
aa(lp304
VIt's just love.
p305
aVWe could all use a little more love,
p306
aVa lot more love.
p307
aVAny time my child asks me to play,
p308
aVI will say yes.
p309
aVI make it a firm rule for one reason,
p310
aVto give myself permission,
p311
aVto free me from all of my workaholic guilt.
p312
aVIt's a law, so I don't have a choice,
p313
aVand I don't have a choice,
p314
aVnot if I want to feel the hum.
p315
aa(lp316
VI wish it were that easy,
p317
aVbut I'm not good at playing.
p318
aVI don't like it.
p319
aVI'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work.
p320
aVThe truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face.
p321
aVI don't like playing.
p322
aVI work all the time because I like working.
p323
aVI like working more than I like being at home.
p324
aVFacing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle,
p325
aVbecause what kind of person likes working more than being at home?
p326
aa(lp327
VWell, me.
p328
aVI mean, let's be honest, I call myself a titan.
p329
aVI've got issues.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VWe run around the yard, up and back and up and back.
p338
aVWe have 30-second dance parties.
p339
aVWe sing show tunes. We play with balls.
p340
aVI blow bubbles and they pop them.
p341
aVAnd I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time.
p342
aVI itch for my cell phone always.
p343
aVBut it is OK.
p344
aVMy tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up.
p345
aVI play and I play until I begin to wonder
p346
aVwhy we ever stop playing in the first place.
p347
aa(lp348
VYou can do it too,
p349
aVsay yes every time your child asks you to play.
p350
aVAre you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes?
p351
aVYou're right, but you can still do this.
p352
aVYou have time.
p353
aVYou know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet.
p354
aVYour child does not think you're that interesting.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VYou only need 15 minutes.
p359
aVMy two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me
p360
aVfor about 15 minutes or so
p361
aVbefore they think to themselves they want to do something else.
p362
aVIt's an amazing 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes.
p363
aVIf I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes.
p364
aa(lp365
V(Laughter)
p366
aa(lp367
VAnd my 13-year-old, if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes
p368
aVI'm Parent of the Year.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Laughter)
p371
aa(lp372
V15 minutes is all you need.
p373
aVI can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day.
p374
aVUninterrupted is the key.
p375
aVNo cell phone, no laundry, no anything.
p376
aVYou have a busy life. You have to get dinner on the table.
p377
aVYou have to force them to bathe. But you can do 15 minutes.
p378
aVMy kids are my happy place, they're my world,
p379
aVbut it doesn't have to be your kids,
p380
aVthe fuel that feeds your hum,
p381
aVthe place where life feels more good than not good.
p382
aVIt's not about playing with your kids,
p383
aVit's about joy.
p384
aVIt's about playing in general.
p385
aVGive yourself the 15 minutes.
p386
aVFind what makes you feel good.
p387
aVJust figure it out and play in that arena.
p388
aa(lp389
VI'm not perfect at it. In fact, I fail as often as I succeed,
p390
aVseeing friends, reading books, staring into space.
p391
aV"Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand for indulging myself
p392
aVin ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show,
p393
aVright around the time I became a titan-in-training,
p394
aVright around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown.
p395
aV15 minutes? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention
p396
aVfor 15 minutes?
p397
aVTurns out, nothing.
p398
aVThe very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return,
p399
aVas if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away.
p400
aVWork doesn't work without play.
p401
aa(lp402
VIt takes a little time, but after a few months,
p403
aVone day the floodgates open
p404
aVand there's a rush, and I find myself standing in my office
p405
aVfilled with an unfamiliar melody, full on groove inside me,
p406
aVand around me, and it sends me spinning with ideas,
p407
aVand the humming road is open, and I can drive it and drive it,
p408
aVand I love working again.
p409
aVBut now, I like that hum, but I don't love that hum.
p410
aVI don't need that hum.
p411
aVI am not that hum. That hum is not me,
p412
aVnot anymore.
p413
aVI am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends.
p414
aVI am that hum.
p415
aVLife's hum.
p416
aVLove's hum.
p417
aVWork's hum is still a piece of me, it is just no longer all of me,
p418
aVand I am so grateful.
p419
aVAnd I don't give a crap about being a titan,
p420
aVbecause I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover.
p421
aa(lp422
VI said yes to less work and more play, and somehow I still run my world.
p423
aVMy brain is still global. My campfires still burn.
p424
aVThe more I play, the happier I am, and the happier my kids are.
p425
aVThe more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
p426
aVThe more I play, the freer my mind becomes.
p427
aVThe more I play, the better I work.
p428
aVThe more I play, the more I feel the hum,
p429
aVthe nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,
p430
aVthe troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum,
p431
aVthe other hum, the real hum,
p432
aVlife's hum.
p433
aVThe more I feel that hum,
p434
aVthe more this strange, quivering, uncocooned,
p435
aVawkward, brand new,
p436
aValive non-titan feels like me.
p437
aVThe more I feel that hum, the more I know who I am.
p438
aVI'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine.
p439
aVThat part of the job, that's living the dream.
p440
aVThat's the dream of the job.
p441
aVBecause a dream job should be a little bit dreamy.
p442
aa(lp443
VI said yes to less work and more play.
p444
aVTitans need not apply.
p445
aa(lp446
VWanna play?
p447
aa(lp448
VThank you.

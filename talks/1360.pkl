VBasking sharks are awesome creatures.
p5
aVThey are just magnificent.
p6
aVThey grow 10 meters long; some say bigger.
p7
aVThey might weigh up to two tons.
p8
aVSome say up to five tons.
p9
aVThey're the second-largest fish in the world.
p10
aVThey're also harmless plankton-feeding animals.
p11
aVAnd they are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour
p12
aVand can feed on 30 kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive.
p13
aVThey're fantastic creatures.
p14
aVWe're very lucky in Ireland,
p15
aVwe have plenty of basking sharks and plenty of opportunities to study them.
p16
aa(lp17
VThey were very important to coastal communities,
p18
aVgoing back hundreds of years,
p19
aVespecially around the Claddaghduff, Connemara region
p20
aVwhere subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats,
p21
aVsometimes way offshore to a place called the Sunfish Bank,
p22
aVabout 30 miles west of Achill Island,
p23
aVto kill the basking sharks.
p24
aVThis is a woodcut from about the 1800s.
p25
aa(lp26
VThey were very important, for the oil out of their liver.
p27
aVA third of the basking shark's size is their liver,
p28
aVand it's full of oil, gallons of oil.
p29
aVThat oil was used especially for lighting,
p30
aVbut also for dressing wounds and other things.
p31
aVIn fact, the streetlights in 1742,
p32
aVof Galway, Dublin and Waterford,
p33
aVwere lit with sunfish oil.
p34
aV"Sunfish" is one of the words for basking sharks.
p35
aVSo they were incredibly important animals.
p36
aVThey've been around a long time, very important to coastal communities.
p37
aa(lp38
VProbably the best-documented basking shark fishery in the world
p39
aVis that from Achill Island.
p40
aVThis is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
p41
aVSharks used to come into the bay,
p42
aVand the fishermen would tie a net off the headland,
p43
aVstring it out, an old Manila net,
p44
aVand as the shark came round, it would hit the net,
p45
aVthe net would collapse on it.
p46
aVIt would often drown and suffocate.
p47
aVOr at times, they would row out in their small curraghs
p48
aVand kill it with a lance through the back of the neck.
p49
aVAnd then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbour,
p50
aVboil them up, use the oil.
p51
aVThey also used the flesh as well, for fertilizer
p52
aVand also would fin the sharks.
p53
aVThis is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide \u2014
p54
aVthe finning of sharks.
p55
aa(lp56
VWe're often frightened of sharks, thanks to "Jaws."
p57
aVMaybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year.
p58
aVThere was someone recently, wasn't there? Just a couple weeks ago.
p59
aVWe kill about 100 million sharks a year.
p60
aVSo I don't know what the balance is,
p61
aVbut I think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them.
p62
aVIt was a well-documented fishery.
p63
aVAs you can see here, it peaked in the '50s,
p64
aVwhere they were killing 1,500 sharks a year.
p65
aVAnd it declined very fast \u2014 a classic boom-and-bust fishery,
p66
aVwhich suggests that a stock has been depleted
p67
aVor there's low reproductive rates.
p68
aVThey killed about 12,000 sharks within this period,
p69
aVliterally just by stringing a Manila rope
p70
aVoff the tip of Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
p71
aa(lp72
VSharks were still killed up into the mid-80s,
p73
aVespecially out of places like Dunmore East in County Waterford.
p74
aVAbout two and a half, 3,000 sharks were killed up till '85,
p75
aVmainly by Norwegian vessels.
p76
aVYou can't really see,
p77
aVbut these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels.
p78
aVThe black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel,
p79
aVrather than a whaling vessel.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe importance of basking sharks to the coast communities
p82
aVis recognized through the language.
p83
aVI don't pretend to [know many Irish words],
p84
aVbut in Kerry they were often known as "ainmhide Na seolta,"
p85
aV"the monster with the sails."
p86
aVAnother title would be "liop an dá lapa,"
p87
aV"the unwieldy beast with two fins."
p88
aV"Liabhán mór," suggesting a big animal.
p89
aVOr my favorite, "liabhán chor gréine," "the great fish of the sun."
p90
aVThat's a lovely, evocative name.
p91
aVOn Tory Island \u2014 a strange place anyway \u2014 they were known as "muldoons."
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VNo one seems to know why.
p96
aVHope there's no one from Tory here. Lovely place.
p97
aVBut more commonly all around the island, they were known as the sunfish.
p98
aVAnd this represents their habit of basking on the surface
p99
aVwhen the sun is out.
p100
aa(lp101
VThere's great concern that basking sharks are depleted
p102
aVall throughout the world.
p103
aVSome say it's not population decline,
p104
aVit might be a change in the distribution of plankton.
p105
aVIt's been suggested
p106
aVthat these sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change,
p107
aVas they're basically continuous plankton recorders,
p108
aVswimming around with their mouth open.
p109
aVThey're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN.
p110
aVThere's movements in Europe to try and stop catching them.
p111
aVThere's now a ban on catching and even landing them,
p112
aVeven landing ones caught accidentally.
p113
aVThey're not protected in Ireland;
p114
aVin fact, they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever,
p115
aVdespite our importance for the species
p116
aVand also the historical context within which basking sharks reside.
p117
aa(lp118
VWe know very little about them.
p119
aVAnd most of what we do know
p120
aVis based on their habit of coming to the surface \u2014
p121
aVwe try and guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface.
p122
aVI only found out last year, at a conference on the Isle of Man,
p123
aVjust how unusual it is to live somewhere
p124
aVwhere basking sharks regularly, frequently and predictably
p125
aVcome to the surface to "bask."
p126
aVIt's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist
p127
aVto see and experience basking sharks.
p128
aVThey are awesome creatures.
p129
aVIt gives us a fantastic opportunity to study them, to get access to them.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhat we've been doing for a couple years \u2014 last year was a big year \u2014
p132
aVis we started tagging sharks,
p133
aVso we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movement
p134
aVand things like that.
p135
aVSo we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry
p136
aVas the two areas where I was mainly active.
p137
aVAnd we tagged them very simply, not very high-tech,
p138
aVwith a big, long pole.
p139
aVThis is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end.
p140
aVYou go up in your boat and tag the shark.
p141
aVAnd we were very effective.
p142
aVWe tagged 105 sharks last summer.
p143
aVWe got 50 in three days off Inishowen Peninsula.
p144
aa(lp145
VHalf the challenge to get access
p146
aVis to be in the right place at the right time.
p147
aVBut it's a very simple, easy technique; I'll show you what it looks like.
p148
aVWe use a pole camera on the boat to actually film the shark.
p149
aVOne, it's to try and work out the gender of the shark.
p150
aVWe also deployed some satellite tags, so we did use high-tech stuff as well.
p151
aVThese are archival tags.
p152
aVWhat they do is store the data.
p153
aVA satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water
p154
aVand can send a signal to the satellite.
p155
aVAnd sharks and fish are underwater most of the time,
p156
aVso this tag actually works out the locations of shark,
p157
aVdepending on the timing and the setting of the sun,
p158
aVplus water temperature and depth.
p159
aVAnd you have to kind of reconstruct the path.
p160
aa(lp161
VWhat happens is,
p162
aVyou set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period \u2014
p163
aVin this case, eight months \u2014
p164
aVand literally to the day, the tag popped off,
p165
aVdrifted up, said hello to the satellite
p166
aVand sent, not all the data, but enough data for us to use.
p167
aVThis is the only way to really work out their behavior and movements
p168
aVwhen they're underwater.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd here's a couple of maps that we've done.
p171
aVIn that one, you can see that we tagged both off Kerry.
p172
aVBasically, it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters.
p173
aVOn Christmas, it was out on the shelf edge.
p174
aVHere's one we haven't ground-truthed yet
p175
aVwith sea-surface temperature and water depth,
p176
aVbut again, the second shark spent most of its time
p177
aVin and around the Irish Sea.
p178
aVColleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark
p179
aVthat went from the Isle of Man to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.
p180
aVNine and a half thousand kilometers \u2014 we never thought that happened.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnother colleague in the States tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.
p183
aVHis tags didn't really work.
p184
aVAll he knows is where he tagged them,
p185
aVand where they popped off.
p186
aVHis tags popped off in the Caribbean,
p187
aVand even in Brazil.
p188
aVWe thought basking sharks were temperate animals
p189
aVand lived in our latitudes,
p190
aVbut in actual fact, they're obviously crossing the equator as well.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo very simple things like that,
p193
aVwe're trying to learn about basking sharks.
p194
aVOne thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing
p195
aVis just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is.
p196
aVI'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretend to understand the genetics.
p197
aVAnd that's why it's great to have collaboration.
p198
aVWhereas I'm a field person,
p199
aVI get panic attacks
p200
aVif I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on.
p201
aVTake me away.
p202
aVSo we can work with geneticists who understand that.
p203
aVSo when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks,
p204
aVthey found that the diversity was incredibly low.
p205
aa(lp206
VIf you look at the first line, really,
p207
aVyou can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar.
p208
aVI think this means they're all sharks
p209
aVand they've come from a common ancestry.
p210
aVBut if you look at nucleotide diversity,
p211
aVwhich is more genetics that are passed on through the parents,
p212
aVyou see that basking sharks, if you look at the first study,
p213
aVwas order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species.
p214
aVYou can see this work was only done in 2006.
p215
aa(lp216
VBefore 2006, we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks.
p217
aVWe had no idea: Did they distinguish into different populations?
p218
aVWere there subpopulations?
p219
aVAnd that's very important if you want to know
p220
aVwhat the population size is, and the status of the animals.
p221
aVSo, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable, really.
p222
aVSo he did another study using microsatellites,
p223
aVwhich is much more expensive, much more time-consuming,
p224
aVand to his surprise, came up with almost identical results.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo it does seem to be that basking sharks, for some reason,
p227
aVhave incredibly low diversity.
p228
aVAnd it's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck,
p229
aVthought to have been 12,000 years ago,
p230
aVand this has caused a very low diversity.
p231
aVAnd yet, if you look at the whale shark,
p232
aVwhich is the other plankton-eating large shark,
p233
aVits diversity is much greater.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo it doesn't really make sense at all.
p236
aVThey found that there was no genetic differentiation
p237
aVbetween any of the world's oceans of basking sharks:
p238
aVeven though they're found throughout the world,
p239
aVyou couldn't tell the difference, genetically,
p240
aVfrom one from the Pacific, Atlantic, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa.
p241
aVThey all basically seem the same.
p242
aVWhich, again, is kind of surprising; you wouldn't expect that.
p243
aVI don't understand or pretend to understand this;
p244
aVI suspect most geneticists don't either,
p245
aVbut they produce the numbers.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo you can actually estimate the population size
p248
aVbased on the diversity of the genetics.
p249
aVAnd Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size:
p250
aV8,200 animals.
p251
aVThat's it \u2014 8,000 animals in the world.
p252
aVYou're thinking, "That's ridiculous. No way."
p253
aVSo Les did a finer study,
p254
aVand he found out it came out about 9,000.
p255
aVUsing different microsatellites gave the different results,
p256
aVbut the mean of all these studies is about 5,000,
p257
aVwhich I personally don't believe.
p258
aVBut then, I am a skeptic.
p259
aVBut even if you toss a few numbers around,
p260
aVyou're probably talking an effective population of about 20,000 animals.
p261
aVDo you remember how many they killed off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?
p262
aVSo what it tells us, actually,
p263
aVis that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species
p264
aVbecause its population is so small.
p265
aVIn fact, of those 20,000,
p266
aV8,000 were thought to be females.
p267
aVThere's only 8,000 basking shark females in the world?
p268
aVI don't know. I don't believe it.
p269
aa(lp270
VThe problem with this is they were constrained with samples.
p271
aVThey didn't get enough samples
p272
aVto really explore the genetics in enough detail.
p273
aVSo, where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis?
p274
aVWell, one obvious source is dead sharks \u2014
p275
aVdead sharks, washed up.
p276
aVWe might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year,
p277
aVif we're kind of lucky.
p278
aVAnother source would be fisheries' bycatch.
p279
aVWe were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets.
p280
aVThat's banned now, and that'll be good news for the sharks.
p281
aVAnd some are caught in nets, in trawls.
p282
aVThis is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas \u2014
p283
aVillegally, because you're not allowed to do that under EU law \u2014
p284
aVand was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak.
p285
aVThey even put a recipe up on the wall,
p286
aVuntil they were told it was illegal.
p287
aVThey actually did get a fine for that.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo if you look at all those studies I showed you,
p290
aVthe total number of samples worldwide
p291
aVis 86, at present.
p292
aVSo it's very important work,
p293
aVand they can ask some really good questions,
p294
aVand tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure,
p295
aVbut they're constrained by lack of samples.
p296
aa(lp297
VWhen we were out tagging our sharks \u2014
p298
aVthis is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB, get in there fast \u2014
p299
aVoccasionally, the sharks do react.
p300
aVOn one occasion, when we were up in Malin Head in Donegal,
p301
aVthe shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail,
p302
aVmore, I think, in startle to the fact that a boat came near it,
p303
aVrather than the tag going in.
p304
aVAnd that was fine. We got wet. No problem.
p305
aVAnd then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head, to the pier,
p306
aVI noticed some black slime on the front of the boat.
p307
aVI used to spend a lot of time on commercial fishing boats,
p308
aVand I remember fishermen saying
p309
aVthey can tell when a basking shark has been caught in a net,
p310
aVbecause it leaves a black slime behind.
p311
aVSo that must have come from the shark.
p312
aa(lp313
VNow, we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics
p314
aVbecause we knew they were very valuable.
p315
aVWe would use conventional methods;
p316
aVI have a crossbow \u2014 you see it in my hand there,
p317
aVwhich we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well.
p318
aVSo I tried that, I tried many techniques.
p319
aVAll it was doing was breaking my arrows,
p320
aVbecause the shark's skin is just so strong.
p321
aVThere was no way we were going to get a sample from that.
p322
aVThat wasn't going to work.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat,
p325
aVI thought, "If you take what you're given in this world ..."
p326
aVSo I scraped it off.
p327
aVI had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists.
p328
aVSo I scraped the slime off and sent it to Aberdeen,
p329
aVand said, "You might try that."
p330
aVAnd they sat on it for months.
p331
aVIt was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man.
p332
aVBut I kept emailing Les, saying,
p333
aV"Have you had a chance to look at my slime?"
p334
aVAnd he was like, "Yeah, yeah. Later."
p335
aVHe thought he'd better do it because I never met him before;
p336
aVhe might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime.
p339
aVThey amplified it and they tested it,
p340
aVand they found, yes, this was actually basking shark DNA,
p341
aVwhich was got from the slime.
p342
aVSo he was very excited.
p343
aVIt became known as "Simon's shark slime."
p344
aVAnd I thought, "Hey, you know, I can build on this."
p345
aVSo we thought, OK, we're going to try to get out and get some slime.
p346
aVSo having spent three-and-a-half thousand on satellite tags ...
p347
aVI then thought I'd invest 7.95 \u2014 the price is still on it \u2014
p348
aVin my local hardware store in Kilrush
p349
aVfor a mop handle,
p350
aVand even less money on some oven cleaners.
p351
aVAnd I wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle
p352
aVand ...
p353
aa(lp354
V(Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VI was desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks.
p357
aVAnd this was into August now, and normally sharks peak in June, July,
p358
aVand you rarely see them, or rarely can be in the right place
p359
aVto find sharks into August.
p360
aVWe were desperate, so we rushed out to the Blaskets
p361
aVas soon as we heard there were sharks there,
p362
aVand managed to find some sharks.
p363
aVSo by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark
p364
aVas it swam under the boat \u2014
p365
aVyou see a shark running under the boat here \u2014
p366
aVwe managed to collect slime.
p367
aVAnd here it is.
p368
aVLook at that lovely black shark slime.
p369
aVAnd in about half an hour, we got five samples.
p370
aVFive individual sharks were sampled
p371
aVusing Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
V(Applause)
p376
aa(lp377
VI've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for 20 years now,
p378
aVand they're a bit more dramatic.
p379
aVYou probably saw the humpback whale footage
p380
aVwe got a month or two ago off County Wexford.
p381
aVAnd you always think you might have some legacy
p382
aVyou can leave the world behind,
p383
aVand I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins.
p384
aVBut hey \u2014 sometimes these things are sent to you
p385
aVand you just have to take them when they come.
p386
aVSo this is possibly going to be my legacy \u2014
p387
aVSimon's Shark Slime.
p388
aa(lp389
VWe got more money this year
p390
aVto carry on collecting more and more samples.
p391
aVOne thing that is very useful is that we use a pole camera \u2014
p392
aVthis is my colleague, Joanne, with a pole camera \u2014
p393
aVwhere you can look underneath the shark.
p394
aVWhat you're trying to look at is, the males have claspers,
p395
aVwhich kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark.
p396
aVSo you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark.
p397
aVIf we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it,
p398
aVwe can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female.
p399
aVBecause in the moment, they have no way, genetically,
p400
aVof telling the difference between a male and a female,
p401
aVwhich I find staggering,
p402
aVbecause they don't know what primers to look for.
p403
aVBeing able to tell the gender of a shark
p404
aVis very important for things like policing the trade
p405
aVin basking shark and other species through the sightings,
p406
aVbecause it is illegal to trade in these sharks.
p407
aVAnd they are caught and are on the market.
p408
aa(lp409
VSo as a field biologist,
p410
aVyou just want to get encounters with these animals,
p411
aVand learn as much as you can.
p412
aVThey're often quite brief, they're often very seasonally constrained.
p413
aVYou just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can.
p414
aVBut isn't it fantastic
p415
aVthat you can then offer these samples and opportunities
p416
aVto other disciplines, such as the geneticists,
p417
aVwho can gain so much more from that.
p418
aa(lp419
VSo as I said, these things are sent to you in strange ways.
p420
aVGrab them while you can.
p421
aVI'll take that as my scientific legacy.
p422

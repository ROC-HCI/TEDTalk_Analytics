VChris Anderson: Elon, what kind of crazy dream
p5
aVwould persuade you to think of trying
p6
aVto take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car?
p7
aa(lp8
VElon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university.
p9
aVI thought about, what are the problems that are most likely
p10
aVto affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?
p11
aVI think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport
p12
aVand sustainable energy production.
p13
aVThat sort of overall sustainable energy problem
p14
aVis the biggest problem that we have to solve this century,
p15
aVindependent of environmental concerns.
p16
aVIn fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment,
p17
aVgiven that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons,
p18
aVwe need to find some sustainable means of operating.
p19
aa(lp20
VCA: Most of American electricity comes from
p21
aVburning fossil fuels.
p22
aVHow can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help?
p23
aa(lp24
VEM: Right. There's two elements to that answer.
p25
aVOne is that, even if you take the same source fuel
p26
aVand produce power at the power plant
p27
aVand use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off.
p28
aVSo if you take, say, natural gas,
p29
aVwhich is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel,
p30
aVif you burn that in a modern
p31
aVGeneral Electric natural gas turbine,
p32
aVyou'll get about 60 percent efficiency.
p33
aVIf you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car,
p34
aVyou get about 20 percent efficiency.
p35
aVAnd the reason is, in the stationary power plant,
p36
aVyou can afford to have something that weighs a lot more,
p37
aVis voluminous,
p38
aVand you can take the waste heat
p39
aVand run a steam turbine and generate
p40
aVa secondary power source.
p41
aVSo in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything,
p42
aVeven using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off
p43
aVcharging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant.
p44
aa(lp45
VCA: That scale delivers efficiency.
p46
aa(lp47
VEM: Yes, it does.
p48
aVAnd then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means
p49
aVof power generation anyway, electricity generation.
p50
aVSo given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation,
p51
aVthen it makes sense for us to have electric cars
p52
aVas the mode of transport.
p53
aa(lp54
VCA: So we've got some video here
p55
aVof the Tesla being assembled,
p56
aVwhich, if we could play that first video \u2014
p57
aVSo what is innovative about this process in this vehicle?
p58
aa(lp59
VEM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport,
p60
aVand I should say that I think, actually,
p61
aVall modes of transport will become fully electric
p62
aVwith the ironic exception of rockets.
p63
aVThere's just no way around Newton's third law.
p64
aVThe question is how do you accelerate
p65
aVthe advent of electric transport?
p66
aVAnd in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with
p67
aVa really energy efficient car,
p68
aVso that means making it incredibly light,
p69
aVand so what you're seeing here
p70
aVis the only all-aluminum body and chassis car
p71
aVmade in North America.
p72
aVIn fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques
p73
aVto make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.
p74
aVAnd then it also has the lowest drag coefficient
p75
aVof any car of its size.
p76
aVSo as a result, the energy usage is very low,
p77
aVand it has the most advanced battery pack,
p78
aVand that's what gives it the range that's competitive,
p79
aVso you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.
p80
aa(lp81
VCA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy,
p82
aVbut you think the math can still work out intelligently \u2014
p83
aVby combining light body, heavy battery,
p84
aVyou can still gain spectacular efficiency.
p85
aa(lp86
VEM: Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light
p87
aVto offset the mass of the pack,
p88
aVand then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range.
p89
aVAnd in fact, customers of the Model S
p90
aVare sort of competing with each other
p91
aVto try to get the highest possible range.
p92
aVI think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge.
p93
aa(lp94
VCA: Bruno Bowden, who's here, did that,
p95
aVbroke the world record.EM: Congratulations.
p96
aa(lp97
VCA: That was the good news. The bad news was that
p98
aVto do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed
p99
aVand got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VEM: I mean, you can certainly drive \u2014
p102
aVif you drive it 65 miles an hour,
p103
aVunder normal conditions,
p104
aV250 miles is a reasonable number.
p105
aa(lp106
VCA: Let's show that second video
p107
aVshowing the Tesla in action on ice.
p108
aVNot at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way.
p109
aVWhat is the most surprising thing about the experience
p110
aVof driving the car?
p111
aa(lp112
VEM: In creating an electric car,
p113
aVthe responsiveness of the car is really incredible.
p114
aVSo we wanted really to have people feel as though
p115
aVthey've almost got to mind meld with the car,
p116
aVso you just feel like you and the car are kind of one,
p117
aVand as you corner and accelerate, it just happens,
p118
aVlike the car has ESP.
p119
aVYou can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness.
p120
aVYou can't do that with a gasoline car.
p121
aVI think that's really a profound difference,
p122
aVand people only experience that when they have a test drive.
p123
aa(lp124
VCA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car.
p125
aVIs there a road map where this becomes
p126
aVa mass-market vehicle?
p127
aa(lp128
VEM: Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been
p129
aVto have a sort of three-step process,
p130
aVwhere version one was an expensive car at low volume,
p131
aVversion two is medium priced and medium volume,
p132
aVand then version three would be low price, high volume.
p133
aVSo we're at step two at this point.
p134
aVSo we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.
p135
aVThen we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars.
p136
aVAnd our third generation car, which should hopefully
p137
aVbe out in about three or four years
p138
aVwill be a $30,000 car.
p139
aVBut whenever you've got really new technology,
p140
aVit generally takes about three major versions
p141
aVin order to make it a compelling mass-market product.
p142
aVAnd so I think we're making progress in that direction,
p143
aVand I feel confident that we'll get there.
p144
aa(lp145
VCA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute,
p146
aVyou can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home.
p147
aVThere isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast.
p148
aVDo you see that coming, really, truly,
p149
aVor just on a few key routes?
p150
aa(lp151
VEM: There actually are far more charging stations
p152
aVthan people realize,
p153
aVand at Tesla we developed something
p154
aVcalled a Supercharging technology,
p155
aVand we're offering that if you buy a Model S
p156
aVfor free, forever.
p157
aVAnd so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize.
p158
aVWe actually have California and Nevada covered,
p159
aVand we've got the Eastern seaboard
p160
aVfrom Boston to D.C. covered.
p161
aVBy the end of this year, you'll be able to drive
p162
aVfrom L.A. to New York
p163
aVjust using the Supercharger network,
p164
aVwhich charges at five times the rate of anything else.
p165
aVAnd the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop,
p166
aVto stop time, of about six or seven.
p167
aVSo if you drive for three hours,
p168
aVyou want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes,
p169
aVbecause that's normally what people will stop for.
p170
aVSo if you start a trip at 9 a.m.,
p171
aVby noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat,
p172
aVhit the restroom, coffee, and keep going.
p173
aa(lp174
VCA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour.
p175
aVSo it's common \u2014 don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes.
p176
aVWait for an hour, but the good news is,
p177
aVyou're helping save the planet,
p178
aVand by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything.
p179
aa(lp180
VEM: Actually, what we're expecting is for people
p181
aVto stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour.
p182
aVIt's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles
p183
aVand then stop for half an hour
p184
aVand then keep going.
p185
aVThat's the natural cadence of a trip.
p186
aVCA: All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow.
p187
aVYou've been working on this solar company SolarCity.
p188
aVWhat's unusual about that?
p189
aa(lp190
VEM: Well, as I mentioned earlier,
p191
aVwe have to have sustainable electricity production
p192
aVas well as consumption,
p193
aVso I'm quite confident that the primary means
p194
aVof power generation will be solar.
p195
aVI mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is.
p196
aVWe've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun,
p197
aVand we just need to tap a little bit of that energy
p198
aVfor purposes of human civilization.
p199
aVWhat most people know but don't realize they know
p200
aVis that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already.
p201
aVIf the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball
p202
aVat three degrees Kelvin,
p203
aVand the sun powers the entire system of precipitation.
p204
aVThe whole ecosystem is solar-powered.
p205
aa(lp206
VCA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have,
p207
aVeffectively, thousands of years of sun power
p208
aVcompressed into a small space,
p209
aVso it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar,
p210
aVand to remotely compete with, for example, natural gas,
p211
aVfracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here?
p212
aa(lp213
VEM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar
p214
aVwill beat everything, hands down, including natural gas.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Applause)CA: How?
p217
aa(lp218
VEM: It must, actually. If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble.
p219
aa(lp220
VCA: But you're not selling solar panels to consumers.
p221
aVWhat are you doing?
p222
aVEM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system
p223
aVor you can lease a solar system.
p224
aVMost people choose to lease.
p225
aVAnd the thing about solar power is that
p226
aVit doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs,
p227
aVso once it's installed, it's just there.
p228
aVIt works for decades. It'll work for probably a century.
p229
aVSo therefore, the key thing to do is to get the cost
p230
aVof that initial installation low,
p231
aVand then get the cost of the financing low,
p232
aVbecause that interest \u2014 those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar.
p233
aVAnd we've made huge progress in that direction,
p234
aVand that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas.
p235
aa(lp236
VCA: So your current proposition to consumers is,
p237
aVdon't pay so much up front.
p238
aa(lp239
VEM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front.
p240
aVWe will install panels on your roof.
p241
aVYou will then pay, how long is a typical lease?
p242
aa(lp243
VEM: Typical leases are 20 years,
p244
aVbut the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward.
p245
aVIt's no money down, and your utility bill decreases.
p246
aVPretty good deal.
p247
aa(lp248
VCA: So that seems like a win for the consumer.
p249
aVNo risk, you'll pay less than you're paying now.
p250
aVFor you, the dream here then is that \u2014
p251
aVI mean, who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term?
p252
aVI mean, how do you, the company, benefit?
p253
aa(lp254
VEM: Well, essentially,
p255
aVSolarCity raises a chunk of capital
p256
aVfrom say, a company or a bank.
p257
aVGoogle is one of our big partners here.
p258
aVAnd they have an expected return on that capital.
p259
aVWith that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof
p260
aVand then charges the homeowner or business owner
p261
aVa monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill.
p262
aa(lp263
VCA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power.
p264
aVYou're kind of building a new type of distributed utility.
p265
aa(lp266
VEM: Exactly. What it amounts to
p267
aVis a giant distributed utility.
p268
aVI think it's a good thing, because utilities
p269
aVhave been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice.
p270
aVSo effectively it's the first time
p271
aVthere's been competition for this monopoly,
p272
aVbecause the utilities have been the only ones
p273
aVthat owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof.
p274
aVSo I think it's actually very empowering
p275
aVfor homeowners and businesses.
p276
aa(lp277
VCA: And you really picture a future
p278
aVwhere a majority of power in America,
p279
aVwithin a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar?
p280
aa(lp281
VEM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power,
p282
aVand most likely a majority,
p283
aVand I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years.
p284
aVI made that bet with someone \u2014CA: Definition of plurality is?
p285
aa(lp286
VEM: More from solar than any other source.
p287
aa(lp288
VCA: Ah. Who did you make the bet with?
p289
aa(lp290
VEM: With a friend who will remain nameless.
p291
aa(lp292
VCA: Just between us. (Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VEM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago,
p295
aVso in roughly 18 years,
p296
aVI think we'll see more power from solar than any other source.
p297
aa(lp298
VCA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made
p299
aVwith yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet.
p300
aVYou'd made some money from the sale of PayPal.
p301
aVYou decided to build a space company.
p302
aVWhy on Earth would someone do that?
p303
aV(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VEM: I got that question a lot, that's true.
p306
aVPeople would say, "Did you hear the joke about the guy
p307
aVwho made a small fortune in the space industry?"
p308
aVObviously, "He started with a large one," is the punchline.
p309
aVAnd so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out
p310
aVthe fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one.
p311
aVAnd they'd look at me, like, "Is he serious?"
p312
aa(lp313
VCA: And strangely, you were. So what happened?
p314
aa(lp315
VEM: It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out.
p316
aVWe came very close to failure,
p317
aVbut we managed to get through that point in 2008.
p318
aVThe goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology,
p319
aVand in particular to try to crack a problem
p320
aVthat I think is vital
p321
aVfor humanity to become a space-faring civilization,
p322
aVwhich is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.
p323
aa(lp324
VCA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization?
p325
aVSo that was a dream of yours, in a way, from a young age?
p326
aVYou've dreamed of Mars and beyond?
p327
aa(lp328
VEM: I did build rockets when I was a kid,
p329
aVbut I didn't think I'd be involved in this.
p330
aVIt was really more from the standpoint of
p331
aVwhat are the things that need to happen in order for
p332
aVthe future to be an exciting and inspiring one?
p333
aVAnd I really think there's a fundamental difference,
p334
aVif you sort of look into the future,
p335
aVbetween a humanity that is a space-faring civilization,
p336
aVthat's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets,
p337
aVand I think that's really exciting,
p338
aVcompared with one where we are forever confined to Earth
p339
aVuntil some eventual extinction event.
p340
aa(lp341
VCA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building
p342
aVa rocket by 75 percent, depending on how you calculate it.
p343
aVHow on Earth have you done that?
p344
aVNASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this?
p345
aa(lp346
VEM: Well, we've made significant advances
p347
aVin the technology of the airframe, the engines,
p348
aVthe electronics and the launch operation.
p349
aVThere's a long list of innovations
p350
aVthat we've come up with there
p351
aVthat are a little difficult to communicate in this talk, but \u2014
p352
aa(lp353
VCA: Not least because you could still get copied, right?
p354
aVYou haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me.
p355
aa(lp356
VEM: No, we don't patent.CA: You didn't patent because you think it's
p357
aVmore dangerous to patent than not to patent.
p358
aa(lp359
VEM: Since our primary competitors are national governments,
p360
aVthe enforceability of patents is questionable.(Laughter) (Applause)
p361
aa(lp362
VCA: That's really, really interesting.
p363
aVBut the big innovation is still ahead,
p364
aVand you're working on it now. Tell us about this.
p365
aa(lp366
VEM: Right, so the big innovation\u2014
p367
aa(lp368
VCA: In fact, let's roll that video and you can talk us through it, what's happening here.
p369
aa(lp370
VEM: Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that
p371
aVthey're all expendable.
p372
aVAll rockets that fly today are fully expendable.
p373
aVThe space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket,
p374
aVbut even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time,
p375
aVand the parts that were reusable
p376
aVtook a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight.
p377
aVSo the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.
p378
aVObviously that doesn't work very well for \u2014
p379
aa(lp380
VCA: What just happened there? We just saw something land?
p381
aa(lp382
VEM: That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages
p383
aVbe able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site
p384
aVand be ready to launch again within a matter of hours.
p385
aa(lp386
VCA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause)
p387
aVAnd so what a lot of people don't realize is,
p388
aVthe cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small.
p389
aVIt's much like on a jet.
p390
aVSo the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent
p391
aVof the cost of the rocket.
p392
aVSo it's possible to achieve, let's say,
p393
aVroughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight
p394
aVif you can effectively reuse the rocket.
p395
aVThat's why it's so important.
p396
aVEvery mode of transport that we use,
p397
aVwhether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses,
p398
aVis reusable, but not rockets.
p399
aVSo we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization.
p400
aa(lp401
VCA: You asked me the question earlier
p402
aVof how popular traveling on cruises would be
p403
aVif you had to burn your ships afterward.EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic.
p404
aa(lp405
VCA: Definitely more expensive.
p406
aVSo that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology,
p407
aVand, I guess, paves the way for your dream to actually take,
p408
aVat some point, to take humanity to Mars at scale.
p409
aVYou'd like to see a colony on Mars.
p410
aa(lp411
VEM: Yeah, exactly. SpaceX, or some combination
p412
aVof companies and governments, needs to make progress
p413
aVin the direction of making life multi-planetary,
p414
aVof establishing a base on another planet,
p415
aVon Mars \u2014 being the only realistic option \u2014
p416
aVand then building that base up
p417
aVuntil we're a true multi-planet species.
p418
aa(lp419
VCA: So progress on this "let's make it reusable,"
p420
aVhow is that going? That was just a simulation video we saw.
p421
aVHow's it going?
p422
aa(lp423
VEM: We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently
p424
aVwith something we call the Grasshopper Test Project,
p425
aVwhere we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight,
p426
aVthe sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky.
p427
aVAnd we've had some good tests.
p428
aa(lp429
VCA: Can we see that?EM: Yeah.
p430
aVSo that's just to give a sense of scale.
p431
aVWe dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash
p432
aVand bolted the mannequin to the rocket. (Laughter)
p433
aa(lp434
VCA: All right, let's see that video then,
p435
aVbecause this is actually amazing when you think about it.
p436
aVYou've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then \u2014
p437
aa(lp438
VEM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size
p439
aVof a 12-story building.
p440
aV(Rocket launch)
p441
aVSo now it's hovering at about 40 meters,
p442
aVand it's constantly adjusting

p447
aVElon, how have you done this?
p448
aVThese projects are so \u2014 Paypal, SolarCity,
p449
aVTesla, SpaceX, they're so spectacularly different,
p450
aVthey're such ambitious projects at scale.
p451
aVHow on Earth has one person
p452
aVbeen able to innovate in this way?
p453
aVWhat is it about you?
p454
aa(lp455
VEM: I don't know, actually.
p456
aVI don't have a good answer for you.
p457
aVI work a lot. I mean, a lot.
p458
aa(lp459
VCA: Well, I have a theory.EM: Okay. All right.
p460
aa(lp461
VCA: My theory is that you
p462
aVhave an ability to think at a system level of design
p463
aVthat pulls together design, technology and business,
p464
aVso if TED was TBD, design, technology and business,
p465
aVinto one package,
p466
aVsynthesize it in a way that very few people can and \u2014
p467
aVand this is the critical thing \u2014 feel so damn confident
p468
aVin that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks.
p469
aVYou bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times.
p470
aVI mean, almost no one can do that.
p471
aVIs that \u2014 could we have some of that secret sauce?
p472
aVCan we put it into our education system? Can someone learn from you?
p473
aVIt is truly amazing what you've done.
p474
aa(lp475
VEM: Well, thanks. Thank you.
p476
aVWell, I do think there's a good framework for thinking.
p477
aVIt is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning.
p478
aVGenerally I think there are \u2014 what I mean by that is,
p479
aVboil things down to their fundamental truths
p480
aVand reason up from there,
p481
aVas opposed to reasoning by analogy.
p482
aVThrough most of our life, we get through life
p483
aVby reasoning by analogy,
p484
aVwhich essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations.
p485
aVAnd you have to do that.
p486
aVOtherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day.
p487
aVBut when you want to do something new,
p488
aVyou have to apply the physics approach.
p489
aVPhysics is really figuring out how to discover
p490
aVnew things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics.
p491
aVIt's really counterintuitive.
p492
aVSo I think that's an important thing to do,
p493
aVand then also to really pay attention to negative feedback,
p494
aVand solicit it, particularly from friends.
p495
aVThis may sound like simple advice,
p496
aVbut hardly anyone does that,
p497
aVand it's incredibly helpful.
p498
aa(lp499
VCA: Boys and girls watching, study physics.
p500
aVLearn from this man.
p501
aVElon Musk, I wish we had all day, but thank you so much for coming to TED.
p502
aa(lp503
VEM: Thank you. CA: That was awesome. That was really, really cool.
p504
aVLook at that. (Applause)
p505
aa(lp506
VJust take a bow. That was fantastic.
p507
aVThank you so much.

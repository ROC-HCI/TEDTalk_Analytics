VSo, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced
p5
aVthat it is going out of print
p6
aVafter 244 years, which made me nostalgic,
p7
aVbecause I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library
p8
aVback when I was a kid,
p9
aVmaybe 12 years old.
p10
aVAnd I wondered if I could update that game,
p11
aVnot just for modern methods,
p12
aVbut for the modern me.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo I tried.
p15
aVI went to an online encyclopedia,
p16
aVWikipedia, and I entered the term "Earth."
p17
aVYou can start anywhere, this time I chose Earth.
p18
aVAnd the first rule of the game is pretty simple.
p19
aVYou just have to read the article
p20
aVuntil you find something you don't know,
p21
aVand preferably something your dad doesn't even know.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd in this case, I quickly found this:
p24
aVThe furthest point from the center of the Earth
p25
aVis not the tip of Mount Everest, like I might have thought,
p26
aVit's the tip of this mountain: Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.
p27
aVThe Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun,
p28
aVso the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle,
p29
aVlike some Earthlings.
p30
aVAnd even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes,
p31
aVit's one degree away from the equator,
p32
aVit's riding that bulge, and so the summit of Chimborazo
p33
aVis the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd it is really fun to say.
p36
aVSo I immediately decided,
p37
aVthis is going to be the name of the game,
p38
aVor my new exclamation.
p39
aVYou can use it at TED.
p40
aVChimborazo, right?
p41
aVIt's like "eureka" and "bingo" had a baby.
p42
aVI didn't know that;
p43
aVthat's pretty cool.
p44
aVChimborazo!
p45
aa(lp46
VSo the next rule of the game is also pretty simple.
p47
aVYou just have to find another term and look that up.
p48
aVNow in the old days, that meant getting out a volume
p49
aVand browsing through it alphabetically,
p50
aVmaybe getting sidetracked,
p51
aVthat was fun.
p52
aa(lp53
VNowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from.
p54
aVI can go literally anywhere in the world,
p55
aVI think since I was already in Ecuador,
p56
aVI just decided to click on the word "tropical."
p57
aVThat took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics
p58
aVthat encircles the Earth.
p59
aa(lp60
VNow that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north
p61
aVand the Tropic of Capricorn in the south,
p62
aVthat much I knew,
p63
aVbut I was surprised to learn this little fact:
p64
aVThose are not cartographers' lines,
p65
aVlike latitude or the borders between nations,
p66
aVthey are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt,
p67
aVand they change.
p68
aVThey move; they go up, they go down.
p69
aVIn fact, for years, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn
p70
aVhave been steadily drifting towards the equator
p71
aVat the rate of about 15 meters per year,
p72
aVand nobody told me that.
p73
aVI didn't know it.
p74
aVChimborazo!
p75
aa(lp76
VSo to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up.
p77
aVSince I'm already in the tropics, I chose "Tropical rainforest."
p78
aVFamous for its diversity, human diversity.
p79
aVThere are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet.
p80
aVThey're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests.
p81
aVThis is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended."
p82
aa(lp83
VThe link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end.
p84
aVIt mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then
p85
aVcoleoptera,
p86
aVwhich turn out to be beetles.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow I clicked on this on purpose,
p89
aVbut if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake,
p90
aVit does remind me, for the band, see "The Beatles,"
p91
aVfor the car see "Volkswagon Beetle,"
p92
aVbut I am here for beetle beetles.
p93
aVThis is the most successful order on the planet by far.
p94
aVSomething between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet,
p95
aVincluding plants, are beetles.
p96
aVThat means the next time you are in the grocery store,
p97
aVtake a look at the four people ahead of you in line.
p98
aVStatistically, one of you is a beetle.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd if it is you, you are astonishingly well adapted.
p101
aVThere are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums.
p102
aVThere are predator beetles, that attack other insects
p103
aVand still look pretty cute to us.
p104
aVThere are beetles that roll little balls of dung
p105
aVgreat distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings.
p106
aVThis reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri,
p107
aVwho renews the ball of the sun every morning,
p108
aVwhich is how that dung-rolling scarab
p109
aVbecame that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun.
p110
aa(lp111
VBeetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom.
p112
aVFireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles.
p113
aVFireflies are coleoptera, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well.
p114
aa(lp115
VLike my next link:
p116
aVThe chemical language of pheromones.
p117
aVNow the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex.
p118
aVYeah.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd the link to aphrodisiac.
p123
aVNow that's something that increases sexual desire,
p124
aVpossibly chocolate.
p125
aVThere is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine
p126
aVthat might be an aphrodisiac.
p127
aVBut as the article mentions,
p128
aVbecause of enzyme breakdown,
p129
aVit's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally.
p130
aVSo those of you who only eat your chocolate, you might have to experiment.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe link I clicked on here,
p133
aV"sympathetic magic," mostly because I understand what both of those words mean.
p134
aVBut not when they're together like that.
p135
aVI do like sympathy. I do like magic.
p136
aVSo when I click on "sympathetic magic,"
p137
aVI get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls.
p138
aa(lp139
VThis is the boy in me getting lucky again.
p140
aVSympathetic magic is imitation.
p141
aVIf you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it.
p142
aVThat's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings.
p143
aa(lp144
VThe link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind.
p145
aVI would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves.
p146
aVWe've got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork.
p147
aVCommon themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands,
p148
aVusually the left hand.
p149
aa(lp150
VWe have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia,
p151
aVso even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand
p152
aVor blow pigment on it from a tube,
p153
aVI can easily picture how he did it.
p154
aVAnd I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar
p155
aVright there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for "hand,"
p156
aVgo to the page for "hand," where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia
p157
aVI've found in a long time. It's simply this:
p158
aVThe back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow that's embarrassing, because up until now,
p161
aVevery time I've said, "I know it like the back of my hand,"
p162
aVI've really been saying, "I'm totally familiar with that,
p163
aVI just don't know it's freaking name, right?"
p164
aVAnd the link I clicked on here,
p165
aVwell, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar.
p166
aa(lp167
VI click on chimpanzee, and I get our closest genetic relative.
p168
aVPan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller."
p169
aVHe doesn't.
p170
aVHe lives in rainforests and savannas.
p171
aVIt's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us,
p172
aVevolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us,
p173
aVand in some cases, he gets places before us.
p174
aa(lp175
VLike my next link, the almost irresistible link, Ham the Astrochimp.
p176
aVI click on him, and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice, in fact.
p177
aVHe's born in Cameroon,
p178
aVwhich is smack in the middle of my tropics map,
p179
aVand more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles.
p180
aa(lp181
VIn between those two landmarks in Ham's life,
p182
aVhe flew into space.
p183
aVHe experienced weightlessness and re-entry
p184
aVmonths before the first human being to do it,
p185
aVSoviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.
p186
aa(lp187
VWhen I click on Yuri Gagarin's page,
p188
aVI get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature,
p189
aVhuge in heroism.
p190
aVTop estimates, Soviet estimates, put this guy at 1.65 meters,
p191
aVthat is less than five and a half feet tall max,
p192
aVpossibly because he was malnourished as a child.
p193
aa(lp194
VGermans occupied Russia.
p195
aVA Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household,
p196
aVand he and his family built and lived in a mud hut.
p197
aVYears later, the boy from that cramped mud hut
p198
aVwould grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule
p199
aVon the tip of a rocket
p200
aVwho volunteered to be launched into outer space,
p201
aVthe first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet.
p202
aVAnd he didn't just leave it,
p203
aVhe circled it once.
p204
aa(lp205
VFifty years later, as a tribute,
p206
aVthe International Space Station, which is still up there tonight,
p207
aVsynced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit,
p208
aVat the exact same time of day,
p209
aVand filmed it,
p210
aVso you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes
p211
aVof what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride,
p212
aVpossibly a lonely one,
p213
aVthe first person to ever see such a thing.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd then when you've had your fill of that,
p216
aVyou can click on one more link.
p217
aVYou can come back to Earth.
p218
aVYou return to where you started.
p219
aVYou can finish your game.
p220
aVYou just need to find one more fact that you didn't know.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd for me, I quickly landed on this one:
p223
aVThe Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid,
p224
aVwhich is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls.
p225
aa(lp226
VThis is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy.
p227
aVI found it myself.
p228
aVIt's got some math that I can do.
p229
aVI'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it.
p230
aVWhat this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball,
p231
aVif you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and caves
p232
aVand rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls,
p233
aVfireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea,
p234
aVyou just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball,
p235
aVit would be as smooth as a billiard ball,
p236
aVpresumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle.
p237
aa(lp238
VThat's pretty cool.
p239
aVI didn't know that.
p240
aVChimborazo!
p241
aa(lp242
VThank you.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Applause)

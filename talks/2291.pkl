VSo in 1885, Karl Benz invented the automobile.
p5
aVLater that year, he took it out for the first public test drive,
p6
aVand \u2014 true story \u2014 crashed into a wall.
p7
aVFor the last 130 years,
p8
aVwe've been working around that least reliable part of the car, the driver.
p9
aVWe've made the car stronger.
p10
aVWe've added seat belts, we've added air bags,
p11
aVand in the last decade, we've actually started trying to make the car smarter
p12
aVto fix that bug, the driver.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference
p15
aVbetween patching around the problem with driver assistance systems
p16
aVand actually having fully self-driving cars
p17
aVand what they can do for the world.
p18
aVI'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car
p19
aVand allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does,
p20
aVbut first I'm going to talk a little bit about the problem.
p21
aVAnd it's a big problem:
p22
aV1.2 million people are killed on the world's roads every year.
p23
aVIn America alone, 33,000 people are killed each year.
p24
aVTo put that in perspective,
p25
aVthat's the same as a 737 falling out of the sky every working day.
p26
aVIt's kind of unbelievable.
p27
aVCars are sold to us like this,
p28
aVbut really, this is what driving's like.
p29
aVRight? It's not sunny, it's rainy,
p30
aVand you want to do anything other than drive.
p31
aVAnd the reason why is this:
p32
aVTraffic is getting worse.
p33
aVIn America, between 1990 and 2010,
p34
aVthe vehicle miles traveled increased by 38 percent.
p35
aVWe grew by six percent of roads,
p36
aVso it's not in your brains.
p37
aVTraffic really is substantially worse than it was not very long ago.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd all of this has a very human cost.
p40
aVSo if you take the average commute time in America, which is about 50 minutes,
p41
aVyou multiply that by the 120 million workers we have,
p42
aVthat turns out to be about six billion minutes
p43
aVwasted in commuting every day.
p44
aVNow, that's a big number, so let's put it in perspective.
p45
aVYou take that six billion minutes
p46
aVand you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person,
p47
aVthat turns out to be 162 lifetimes
p48
aVspent every day, wasted,
p49
aVjust getting from A to B.
p50
aVIt's unbelievable.
p51
aVAnd then, there are those of us who don't have the privilege
p52
aVof sitting in traffic.
p53
aVSo this is Steve.
p54
aVHe's an incredibly capable guy,
p55
aVbut he just happens to be blind,
p56
aVand that means instead of a 30-minute drive to work in the morning,
p57
aVit's a two-hour ordeal of piecing together bits of public transit
p58
aVor asking friends and family for a ride.
p59
aVHe doesn't have that same freedom that you and I have to get around.
p60
aVWe should do something about that.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, conventional wisdom would say
p63
aVthat we'll just take these driver assistance systems
p64
aVand we'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them,
p65
aVand over time, they'll turn into self-driving cars.
p66
aVWell, I'm here to tell you that's like me saying
p67
aVthat if I work really hard at jumping, one day I'll be able to fly.
p68
aVWe actually need to do something a little different.
p69
aVAnd so I'm going to talk to you about three different ways
p70
aVthat self-driving systems are different than driver assistance systems.
p71
aVAnd I'm going to start with some of our own experience.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo back in 2013,
p74
aVwe had the first test of a self-driving car
p75
aVwhere we let regular people use it.
p76
aVWell, almost regular \u2014 they were 100 Googlers,
p77
aVbut they weren't working on the project.
p78
aVAnd we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives.
p79
aVBut unlike a real self-driving car, this one had a big asterisk with it:
p80
aVThey had to pay attention,
p81
aVbecause this was an experimental vehicle.
p82
aVWe tested it a lot, but it could still fail.
p83
aVAnd so we gave them two hours of training,
p84
aVwe put them in the car, we let them use it,
p85
aVand what we heard back was something awesome,
p86
aVas someone trying to bring a product into the world.
p87
aVEvery one of them told us they loved it.
p88
aVIn fact, we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day,
p89
aV"This is completely stupid. What are we thinking?"
p90
aVBut at the end of it, he said, "Not only should I have it,
p91
aVeveryone else should have it, because people are terrible drivers."
p92
aVSo this was music to our ears,
p93
aVbut then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing,
p94
aVand this was eye-opening.
p95
aVNow, my favorite story is this gentleman
p96
aVwho looks down at his phone and realizes the battery is low,
p97
aVso he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack,
p98
aVpulls out his laptop,
p99
aVputs it on the seat,
p100
aVgoes in the back again,
p101
aVdigs around, pulls out the charging cable for his phone,
p102
aVfutzes around, puts it into the laptop, puts it on the phone.
p103
aVSure enough, the phone is charging.
p104
aVAll the time he's been doing 65 miles per hour down the freeway.
p105
aVRight? Unbelievable.
p106
aVSo we thought about this and we said, it's kind of obvious, right?
p107
aVThe better the technology gets,
p108
aVthe less reliable the driver is going to get.
p109
aVSo by just making the cars incrementally smarter,
p110
aVwe're probably not going to see the wins we really need.
p111
aa(lp112
VLet me talk about something a little technical for a moment here.
p113
aVSo we're looking at this graph, and along the bottom
p114
aVis how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn't.
p115
aVYou can ignore most of that axis,
p116
aVbecause if you're driving around town, and the car starts stopping randomly,
p117
aVyou're never going to buy that car.
p118
aVAnd the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes
p119
aVwhen it's supposed to to help you avoid an accident.
p120
aVNow, if we look at the bottom left corner here,
p121
aVthis is your classic car.
p122
aVIt doesn't apply the brakes for you, it doesn't do anything goofy,
p123
aVbut it also doesn't get you out of an accident.
p124
aVNow, if we want to bring a driver assistance system into a car,
p125
aVsay with collision mitigation braking,
p126
aVwe're going to put some package of technology on there,
p127
aVand that's this curve, and it's going to have some operating properties,
p128
aVbut it's never going to avoid all of the accidents,
p129
aVbecause it doesn't have that capability.
p130
aVBut we'll pick some place along the curve here,
p131
aVand maybe it avoids half of accidents that the human driver misses,
p132
aVand that's amazing, right?
p133
aVWe just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two.
p134
aVThere are now 17,000 less people dying every year in America.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut if we want a self-driving car,
p137
aVwe need a technology curve that looks like this.
p138
aVWe're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle,
p139
aVand we'll pick some operating point up here
p140
aVwhere it basically never gets into a crash.
p141
aVThey'll happen, but very low frequency.
p142
aVNow you and I could look at this and we could argue
p143
aVabout whether it's incremental, and I could say something like "80-20 rule,"
p144
aVand it's really hard to move up to that new curve.
p145
aVBut let's look at it from a different direction for a moment.
p146
aVSo let's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing.
p147
aVAnd so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system.
p148
aVIt turns out that human drivers
p149
aVmake mistakes that lead to traffic accidents
p150
aVabout once every 100,000 miles in America.
p151
aVIn contrast, a self-driving system is probably making decisions
p152
aVabout 10 times per second,
p153
aVso order of magnitude,
p154
aVthat's about 1,000 times per mile.
p155
aVSo if you compare the distance between these two,
p156
aVit's about 10 to the eighth, right?
p157
aVEight orders of magnitude.
p158
aVThat's like comparing how fast I run
p159
aVto the speed of light.
p160
aVIt doesn't matter how hard I train, I'm never actually going to get there.
p161
aVSo there's a pretty big gap there.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd then finally, there's how the system can handle uncertainty.
p164
aVSo this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road, might not be.
p165
aVI can't tell, nor can any of our algorithms,
p166
aVbut in the case of a driver assistance system,
p167
aVthat means it can't take action, because again,
p168
aVif it presses the brakes unexpectedly, that's completely unacceptable.
p169
aVWhereas a self-driving system can look at that pedestrian and say,
p170
aVI don't know what they're about to do,
p171
aVslow down, take a better look, and then react appropriately after that.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be.
p174
aVSo that's enough about the differences between the two.
p175
aVLet's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo this is our vehicle.
p178
aVIt starts by understanding where it is in the world,
p179
aVby taking a map and its sensor data and aligning the two,
p180
aVand then we layer on top of that what it sees in the moment.
p181
aVSo here, all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road,
p182
aVand the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist,
p183
aVand up in the distance, if you look really closely,
p184
aVyou can see some cones.
p185
aVThen we know where the car is in the moment,
p186
aVbut we have to do better than that: we have to predict what's going to happen.
p187
aVSo here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change
p188
aVbecause the road in front of it is closed,
p189
aVso it needs to get out of the way.
p190
aVKnowing that one pickup truck is great,
p191
aVbut we really need to know what everybody's thinking,
p192
aVso it becomes quite a complicated problem.
p193
aVAnd then given that, we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment,
p194
aVso what trajectory it should follow, how quickly it should slow down or speed up.
p195
aVAnd then that all turns into just following a path:
p196
aVturning the steering wheel left or right, pressing the brake or gas.
p197
aVIt's really just two numbers at the end of the day.
p198
aVSo how hard can it really be?
p199
aa(lp200
VBack when we started in 2009,
p201
aVthis is what our system looked like.
p202
aVSo you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road,
p203
aVdriving down the highway.
p204
aVThe car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are.
p205
aVIt's really a geometric understanding of the world.
p206
aVOnce we started driving on neighborhood and city streets,
p207
aVthe problem becomes a whole new level of difficulty.
p208
aVYou see pedestrians crossing in front of us, cars crossing in front of us,
p209
aVgoing every which way,
p210
aVthe traffic lights, crosswalks.
p211
aVIt's an incredibly complicated problem by comparison.
p212
aVAnd then once you have that problem solved,
p213
aVthe vehicle has to be able to deal with construction.
p214
aVSo here are the cones on the left forcing it to drive to the right,
p215
aVbut not just construction in isolation, of course.
p216
aVIt has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well.
p217
aVAnd of course, if anyone's breaking the rules, the police are there
p218
aVand the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car
p219
aVmeans that it's not just a car, it's actually a police officer.
p220
aVSimilarly, the orange box on the side here,
p221
aVit's a school bus,
p222
aVand we have to treat that differently as well.
p223
aa(lp224
VWhen we're out on the road, other people have expectations:
p225
aVSo, when a cyclist puts up their arm,
p226
aVit means they're expecting the car to yield to them and make room for them
p227
aVto make a lane change.
p228
aVAnd when a police officer stood in the road,
p229
aVour vehicle should understand that this means stop,
p230
aVand when they signal to go, we should continue.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow, the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles.
p233
aVThe first, most crude model of this
p234
aVis when one vehicle sees a construction zone,
p235
aVhaving another know about it so it can be in the correct lane
p236
aVto avoid some of the difficulty.
p237
aVBut we actually have a much deeper understanding of this.
p238
aVWe could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time,
p239
aVthe hundreds of thousands of pedestrians, cyclists,
p240
aVand vehicles that have been out there
p241
aVand understand what they look like
p242
aVand use that to infer what other vehicles should look like
p243
aVand other pedestrians should look like.
p244
aVAnd then, even more importantly, we could take from that a model
p245
aVof how we expect them to move through the world.
p246
aVSo here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us.
p247
aVHere the blue box is a cyclist and we anticipate
p248
aVthat they're going to nudge out and around the car to the right.
p249
aVHere there's a cyclist coming down the road
p250
aVand we know they're going to continue to drive down the shape of the road.
p251
aVHere somebody makes a right turn,
p252
aVand in a moment here, somebody's going to make a U-turn in front of us,
p253
aVand we can anticipate that behavior and respond safely.
p254
aa(lp255
VNow, that's all well and good for things that we've seen,
p256
aVbut of course, you encounter lots of things that you haven't
p257
aVseen in the world before.
p258
aVAnd so just a couple of months ago,
p259
aVour vehicles were driving through Mountain View,
p260
aVand this is what we encountered.
p261
aVThis is a woman in an electric wheelchair
p262
aVchasing a duck in circles on the road. (Laughter)
p263
aVNow it turns out, there is nowhere in the DMV handbook
p264
aVthat tells you how to deal with that,
p265
aVbut our vehicles were able to encounter that,
p266
aVslow down, and drive safely.
p267
aVNow, we don't have to deal with just ducks.
p268
aVWatch this bird fly across in front of us. The car reacts to that.
p269
aVHere we're dealing with a cyclist
p270
aVthat you would never expect to see anywhere other than Mountain View.
p271
aVAnd of course, we have to deal with drivers,
p272
aVeven the very small ones.
p273
aVWatch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us.
p274
aVAnd now, watch the left as the car with the green box decides
p275
aVhe needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment.
p276
aVHere, as we make a lane change, the car to our left decides
p277
aVit wants to as well.
p278
aVAnd here, we watch a car blow through a red light
p279
aVand yield to it.
p280
aVAnd similarly, here, a cyclist blowing through that light as well.
p281
aVAnd of course, the vehicle responds safely.
p282
aVAnd of course, we have people who do I don't know what
p283
aVsometimes on the road, like this guy pulling out between two self-driving cars.
p284
aVYou have to ask, "What are you thinking?"
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, I just fire-hosed you with a lot of stuff there,
p288
aVso I'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly.
p289
aVSo what we're looking at is the scene with the cyclist again,
p290
aVand you might notice in the bottom, we can't actually see the cyclist yet,
p291
aVbut the car can: it's that little blue box up there,
p292
aVand that comes from the laser data.
p293
aVAnd that's not actually really easy to understand,
p294
aVso what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn that laser data and look at it,
p295
aVand if you're really good at looking at laser data, you can see
p296
aVa few dots on the curve there,
p297
aVright there, and that blue box is that cyclist.
p298
aVNow as our light is red,
p299
aVthe cyclist's light has turned yellow already,
p300
aVand if you squint, you can see that in the imagery.
p301
aVBut the cyclist, we see, is going to proceed through the intersection.
p302
aVOur light has now turned green, his is solidly red,
p303
aVand we now anticipate that this bike is going to come all the way across.
p304
aVUnfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention.
p305
aVThey started to pull forward, and fortunately for everyone,
p306
aVthis cyclists reacts, avoids,
p307
aVand makes it through the intersection.
p308
aVAnd off we go.
p309
aa(lp310
VNow, as you can see, we've made some pretty exciting progress,
p311
aVand at this point we're pretty convinced
p312
aVthis technology is going to come to market.
p313
aVWe do three million miles of testing in our simulators every single day,
p314
aVso you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have.
p315
aVWe are looking forward to having this technology on the road,
p316
aVand we think the right path is to go through the self-driving
p317
aVrather than driver assistance approach
p318
aVbecause the urgency is so large.
p319
aVIn the time I have given this talk today,
p320
aV34 people have died on America's roads.
p321
aa(lp322
VHow soon can we bring it out?
p323
aVWell, it's hard to say because it's a really complicated problem,
p324
aVbut these are my two boys.
p325
aVMy oldest son is 11, and that means in four and a half years,
p326
aVhe's going to be able to get his driver's license.
p327
aVMy team and I are committed to making sure that doesn't happen.
p328
aa(lp329
VThank you.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p332
aVChris Anderson: Chris, I've got a question for you.
p333
aa(lp334
VChris Urmson: Sure.
p335
aa(lp336
VCA: So certainly, the mind of your cars is pretty mind-boggling.
p337
aVOn this debate between driver-assisted and fully driverless \u2014
p338
aVI mean, there's a real debate going on out there right now.
p339
aVSo some of the companies, for example, Tesla,
p340
aVare going the driver-assisted route.
p341
aVWhat you're saying is that that's kind of going to be a dead end
p342
aVbecause you can't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless
p343
aVat some point, and then a driver is going to say, "This feels safe,"
p344
aVand climb into the back, and something ugly will happen.
p345
aa(lp346
VCU: Right. No, that's exactly right, and it's not to say
p347
aVthat the driver assistance systems aren't going to be incredibly valuable.
p348
aVThey can save a lot of lives in the interim,
p349
aVbut to see the transformative opportunity to help someone like Steve get around,
p350
aVto really get to the end case in safety,
p351
aVto have the opportunity to change our cities
p352
aVand move parking out and get rid of these urban craters we call parking lots,
p353
aVit's the only way to go.
p354
aa(lp355
VCA: We will be tracking your progress with huge interest.
p356
aVThanks so much, Chris. CU: Thank you. (Applause)

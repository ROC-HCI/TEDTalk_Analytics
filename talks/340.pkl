VGood afternoon, good evening, whatever.
p5
aVWe can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir,
p6
aVbut we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
p7
aVThat is the call that chimpanzees make
p8
aVbefore they go to sleep in the evening.
p9
aVYou hear it going from one side of the valley to the other,
p10
aVfrom one group of nests to the next.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd I want to pick up with my talk this evening
p13
aVfrom where Zeray left off yesterday.
p14
aVHe was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.
p15
aVAnd we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind
p16
aVthrough DNA genetic profiling.
p17
aVAnd it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey,
p18
aVwho actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.
p19
aVAnd it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.
p20
aVIt's kind of commonplace now,
p21
aVbut his argument was \u2014 because he'd been searching
p22
aVfor the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.
p23
aVAnd you can tell an awful lot
p24
aVabout what those beings looked like from the fossils,
p25
aVfrom the shape of the muscle attachments,
p26
aVsomething about the way they lived
p27
aVfrom the various artifacts found with them.
p28
aVBut what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.
p29
aVAnd of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.
p30
aVHe argued \u2014 and it's now a fairly common theory \u2014
p31
aVthat if we found behavior patterns similar or the same
p32
aVin our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,
p33
aVthen maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,
p34
aVhuman-like ancestor some seven million years ago.
p35
aVAnd therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us
p36
aVfrom that ancient, ancient past.
p37
aa(lp38
VWell, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution,
p39
aVyou very often find people speculating about how early humans
p40
aVmay have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.
p41
aVThey are more like us than any other living creature,
p42
aVand we've heard about that during this TED Conference.
p43
aVSo it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees
p44
aVare so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.
p45
aa(lp46
VEvery chimpanzee has his or her own personality.
p47
aVOf course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,
p48
aValthough we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.
p49
aVMr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.
p50
aVThereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,
p51
aVa long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,
p52
aVsleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.
p53
aVAnd we believe that this long period of childhood
p54
aVis important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.
p55
aVAs the brain becomes ever more complex
p56
aVduring evolution in different forms of animals,
p57
aVso we find that learning plays an ever more important role
p58
aVin an individual's life history.
p59
aVAnd young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.
p60
aVWe know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.
p61
aVAnd we believe that it's in this way
p62
aVthat the different tool-using behaviors \u2014 that have now been seen
p63
aVin all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa \u2014
p64
aVhow these are passed from one generation to the next,
p65
aVthrough observation, imitation and practice,
p66
aVso that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.
p67
aa(lp68
VChimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.
p69
aVThey do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,
p70
aVmany of which are similar, or even identical, to ours
p71
aVand formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.
p72
aVThey also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.
p73
aVAnd they swagger and they throw rocks.
p74
aVIn chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,
p75
aVprecursors to love and true altruism.
p76
aVUnfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.
p77
aVThey're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.
p78
aVAnd these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,
p79
aVare directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.
p80
aVThey are very territorially aggressive.
p81
aVChimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,
p82
aVhave helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line
p83
aVbetween humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.
p84
aa(lp85
VIt's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time
p86
aVas we make even more observations.
p87
aVThe study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.
p88
aVAnd these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,
p89
aVhave helped \u2014 more than anything else \u2014
p90
aVto make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,
p91
aVthe amazing animals with whom we share the planet.
p92
aVSo it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees,
p93
aVlike so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.
p94
aVThis is just one photograph from the air,
p95
aVand it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.
p96
aVAnd it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,
p97
aVand realized that outside the park, this forest,
p98
aVwhich in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken
p99
aValong the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika,
p100
aVwhich is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,
p101
aVthat a question came to my mind.
p102
aV"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,
p103
aVwhen the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?"
p104
aVMore people are living there than the land could possibly support.
p105
aVThe numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi
p106
aVand over the lake from Congo.
p107
aVAnd very poor people \u2014 they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis led to a program, which we call TACARE.
p110
aVIt's a very holistic way of improving the lives
p111
aVof the people living in the villages around the park.
p112
aVIt started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.
p113
aVThere isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,
p114
aVmethods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,
p115
aValmost desert-like land up in these mountains.
p116
aVWays of controlling, preventing soil erosion.
p117
aVWays of reclaiming overused farmland,
p118
aVso that within two years they can again be productive.
p119
aVWorking to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.
p120
aVPerhaps build some schoolrooms.
p121
aVMost important of all, I believe,
p122
aVis working with small groups of women,
p123
aVproviding them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.
p124
aVAnd we've got, as is the case around the world,
p125
aVabout 95 percent of all loans returned.
p126
aVEmpowering women, working with education,
p127
aVproviding scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,
p128
aVin the clear understanding that, all around the world,
p129
aVas women's education improves, family size drops.
p130
aVWe provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd as a result of this program,
p133
aVsomething's happening for conservation.
p134
aVWhat's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,
p135
aVinstead of looking on us as a bunch of white people
p136
aVcoming to study a whole bunch of monkeys \u2014
p137
aVand by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian \u2014
p138
aVbut when we began the TACARE program,
p139
aVit was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.
p140
aVIt was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,
p141
aVasking what they were interested in.
p142
aVWere they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.
p143
aVThey were interested in health; they were interested in education.
p144
aVAnd as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,
p145
aVthey began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.
p146
aVThey began to understand
p147
aVthat as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,
p148
aVso you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.
p149
aa(lp150
VToday, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.
p151
aVThis is an area way outside the National Park,
p152
aVstretching out into all these very degraded lands.
p153
aVAnd as these villages have a better standard of life,
p154
aVthey are actually agreeing to put
p155
aVbetween 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,
p156
aVso that once again, as the trees grow back,
p157
aVthe chimpanzees will have leafy corridors
p158
aVthrough which they can travel to interact \u2014
p159
aVas they must for genetic viability \u2014
p160
aVwith other remnant groups outside the National Park.
p161
aVSo TACARE is a success.
p162
aVWe're replicating it in other parts of Africa,
p163
aVaround other wilderness areas
p164
aVwhich are faced with extreme population pressure.
p165
aa(lp166
VThe problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing
p167
aVfor the whole of these first couple of days of TED,
p168
aVare major problems.
p169
aVThere is a great deal of poverty.
p170
aVAnd when you get large numbers of people
p171
aVliving in land that is not that fertile,
p172
aVparticularly when you cut down trees,
p173
aVand you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,
p174
aVas desperate populations cut down more and more trees,
p175
aVso that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,
p176
aVwhat's going to happen? Something's got to give.
p177
aVAnd the other problems \u2014 in not only Africa,
p178
aVbut the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere \u2014
p179
aVwhat are we doing to our planet?
p180
aVYou know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson
p181
aVsaid that if every person on this planet
p182
aVattains the standard of living of the average European or American,
p183
aVwe need three new planets.
p184
aVToday, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are,
p187
aVarguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,
p188
aVwith this extraordinary brain,
p189
aVcapable of the kind of technology
p190
aVthat is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,
p191
aVand yet we're destroying the only home we have.
p192
aVThe indigenous people around the world,
p193
aVbefore they made a major decision,
p194
aVused to sit around and ask themselves,
p195
aV"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"
p196
aVToday, major decisions \u2014 and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,
p197
aVbut the developed world \u2014
p198
aVmajor decisions involving millions of dollars,
p199
aVand millions of people, are often based on,
p200
aV"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?"
p201
aVAnd these decisions affect Africa.
p202
aa(lp203
VAs I began traveling around Africa
p204
aVtalking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,
p205
aVI realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems
p206
aVcould be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.
p207
aVSo I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,
p208
aVtalking in the United States, going to Asia.
p209
aVAnd everywhere there were these terrible problems.
p210
aVAnd you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.
p211
aVThe air that we breathe that often poisons us.
p212
aVThe earth is poisoning our foods.
p213
aVThe water \u2014 water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues
p214
aVthat we're going to face in this century \u2014
p215
aVand everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural,
p216
aVindustrial and household chemicals
p217
aVthat still are being sprayed around the world,
p218
aVseemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.
p219
aVThe mangroves are being cut down;
p220
aVthe effects of things like the tsunami get worse.
p221
aVWe've talked about the soil erosion.
p222
aVWe have the reckless burning of fossil fuels
p223
aValong with other greenhouse gasses, so called,
p224
aVleading to climate change.
p225
aVFinally, all around the world, people have begun to believe
p226
aVthat there is something going on very wrong with our climate.
p227
aa(lp228
VAll around the world climates are mixed up.
p229
aVAnd it's the poor people who are affected worse.
p230
aVIt's Africa that already is affected.
p231
aVIn many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.
p232
aVAnd when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding
p233
aVand added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.
p234
aVAnd the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,
p235
aVwho are too poor to buy food,
p236
aVwho can't move away because the whole land is degraded.
p237
aVAnd so you get desertification \u2014 creeping, creeping, creeping \u2014
p238
aVas the last of the trees are cut down.
p239
aVAnd this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo it wasn't surprising to me
p242
aVthat as I was traveling around the world
p243
aVI met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.
p244
aVWe seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.
p245
aVI asked a question. "Why?"
p246
aVWell, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect
p247
aVbetween this extraordinarily clever brain,
p248
aVthe kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,
p249
aVand the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,
p250
aVin terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?
p251
aVAnd these young people, when I talk to them,
p252
aVbasically they were either depressed or apathetic,
p253
aVor bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,
p254
aV"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future
p255
aVand there's nothing we can do about it."
p256
aa(lp257
VWe have compromised their future.
p258
aVI've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them
p259
aVand I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,
p260
aVI feel this desperation.
p261
aVAnd that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,
p262
aVwhich began right here in Tanzania
p263
aVand has now spread to 97 countries around the world.
p264
aVIt's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.
p265
aVShoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.
p266
aVSee the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,
p267
aVenvironmental and social. It's a message of hope.
p268
aVHundreds and thousands of young people around the world
p269
aVcan break through and can make this a better world for all living things.
p270
aVThe most important message of Roots and Shoots:
p271
aVevery single one of us makes a difference, every single day.
p272
aVWe have a choice. Every one of us in this room,
p273
aVwe have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.
p274
aVThe very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things
p275
aVso that the poor have choice as well.
p276
aa(lp277
VThe Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.
p278
aVIt depends on how old they are, and which country,
p279
aVwhether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.
p280
aVBut basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,
p281
aVwith more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.
p282
aVAnd every group chooses, between them,
p283
aVthree different kinds of project to make this a better world,
p284
aVrecognizing that all these different problems are interconnected
p285
aVand impinge on each other.
p286
aVSo one of their projects will be to help their own human community.
p287
aVAnd then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities
p288
aVin other parts of the world.
p289
aVOne of their projects will be to help animals \u2014 not just wildlife,
p290
aVdomestic animals as well.
p291
aVAnd one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.
p292
aVAnd woven throughout all of this is a message
p293
aVof learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,
p294
aVin our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,
p295
aVbetween religions and between us and the natural world.
p296
aVWe need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.
p297
aVWe not do have more than this one planet.
p298
aa(lp299
VJust picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa
p300
aVthat the Roots and Shoots groups are doing,
p301
aVone or two projects only \u2014 in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,
p302
aVSouth Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon
p303
aVand other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.
p304
aVOf course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.
p305
aVThey're working in the refugee camps, with chickens
p306
aVand selling the eggs for a little amount of money,
p307
aVor just using them to feed their families,
p308
aVand feeling a sense of pride and empowerment,
p309
aVbecause they're no longer helpless and depending on others
p310
aVwith their vegetables and their chickens.
p311
aVIt's being used in Uganda
p312
aVto give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.
p313
aVDoing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.
p314
aVOnce again, they're useful members of society.
p315
aVWe have this program in prisons as well.
p316
aVSo, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.
p317
aVBut \u2014 oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.
p318
aVThat's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,
p319
aVwith older kids talking to younger ones.
p320
aVAnd unwanted pregnancies and things like that,
p321
aVwhich young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.
p322
aa(lp323
VHope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world:
p324
aV"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things,
p325
aVyou've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number
p326
aVfrom about one million, at the turn of the century,
p327
aVto no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.
p328
aVForests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.
p329
aVDo you really have hope?" Well, yes.
p330
aVYou can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?
p331
aVAnd of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd I mean, think of the technologies.
p334
aVAnd I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.
p335
aVIt's one of my hobbyhorses.
p336
aVWe just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.
p337
aVAnd then talking about renewable energy \u2014 desperately important.
p338
aVDo we care about the planet for our children?
p339
aVHow many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?
p340
aVDo we care about their future?
p341
aVAnd if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,
p342
aVwe can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.
p343
aVWhat we buy. What we wear.
p344
aVAnd choose to make these choices with the question,
p345
aVhow will this affect the environment around me?
p346
aVHow will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?
p347
aVOr my grandchild, or whatever it is.
p348
aVSo the human brain, coupled with the human heart,
p349
aVand we join hands around the world.
p350
aVAnd that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,
p351
aVand Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.
p352
aVAll of these technologies we can use.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?
p355
aVYou've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.
p356
aVThis change, this change. To see change
p357
aVthat we must have if we care about the future.
p358
aVAnd the next reason for hope \u2014 nature is amazingly resilient.
p359
aVYou can take an area that's absolutely destroyed,
p360
aVwith time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.
p361
aVAnd an example is the TACARE program.
p362
aVI told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump \u2014
p363
aVif you stop hacking them for firewood,
p364
aVwhich you don't need to because you have wood lots,
p365
aVthen in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.
p366
aVAnd animals, almost on the brink of extinction,
p367
aVcan be given a second chance. That's my next book.
p368
aVIt's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,
p369
aVand we've heard about this so much in the last two days:
p370
aVthis indomitable human spirit. This determination of people,
p371
aVthe resilience of the human spirit,
p372
aVSo that people who you would think would be battered by poverty,
p373
aVor disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it,
p374
aVsometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society,
p375
aVand take their part in changing the world.
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.
p378
aVWe could make a very long list,
p379
aVbut obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years
p380
aVof hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment,
p381
aVwith this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation
p382
aVout the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.
p383
aVKen Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies,
p384
aVand although people around the world tried their best, was executed.
p385
aVPeople like this are so inspirational.
p386
aVPeople like this are the role models we need for young Africans.
p387
aVAnd we need some environmental role models as well,
p388
aVand I've been hearing some of them today.
p389
aVSo I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message
p390
aVagain, with everyone at TED.
p391
aVAnd I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things,
p392
aVespecially the Roots and Shoots program.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd just a last word on that \u2014
p395
aVthe young woman who's running this entire conference center,
p396
aVI met her today.
p397
aVShe came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.
p398

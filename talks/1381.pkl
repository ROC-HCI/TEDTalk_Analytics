VSo a couple of years ago I started a program
p5
aVto try to get the rockstar tech and design people
p6
aVto take a year off
p7
aVand work in the one environment
p8
aVthat represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate;
p9
aVwe have them work in government.
p10
aVThe program is called Code for America,
p11
aVand it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.
p12
aVWe select a few fellows every year
p13
aVand we have them work with city governments.
p14
aVInstead of sending them off into the Third World,
p15
aVwe send them into the wilds of City Hall.
p16
aVAnd there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.
p17
aVBut really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible
p18
aVwith technology today.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo meet Al.
p21
aVAl is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.
p22
aVHere it kind of looks like he's looking for a date,
p23
aVbut what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in,
p24
aVbecause he knows he's not very good at fighting fires
p25
aVwhen he's covered in four feet of snow.
p26
aVNow how did he come to be looking for help
p27
aVin this very unique manner?
p28
aVWe had a team of fellows in Boston last year
p29
aVthrough the Code for America program.
p30
aVThey were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.
p31
aVAnd they noticed that the city never gets
p32
aVto digging out these fire hydrants.
p33
aVBut one fellow in particular,
p34
aVa guy named Erik Michaels-Ober,
p35
aVnoticed something else,
p36
aVand that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks
p37
aVright in front of these things.
p38
aVSo he did what any good developer would do,
p39
aVhe wrote an app.
p40
aa(lp41
VIt's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
p42
aVSo you agree to dig it out when it snows.
p43
aVIf you do, you get to name it,
p44
aVand he called the first one Al.
p45
aVAnd if you don't, someone can steal it from you.
p46
aVSo it's got cute little game dynamics on it.
p47
aVThis is a modest little app.
p48
aVIt's probably the smallest
p49
aVof the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
p50
aVBut it's doing something
p51
aVthat no other government technology does.
p52
aVIt's spreading virally.
p53
aa(lp54
VThere's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu
p55
aVwho saw this app and realized
p56
aVthat he could use it, not for snow,
p57
aVbut to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
p58
aVIt's very important that these tsunami sirens work,
p59
aVbut people steal the batteries out of them.
p60
aVSo he's getting citizens to check on them.
p61
aVAnd then Seattle decided to use it
p62
aVto get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.
p63
aVAnd Chicago just rolled it out
p64
aVto get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.
p65
aVSo we now know of nine cities
p66
aVthat are planning to use this.
p67
aVAnd this has spread just frictionlessly,
p68
aVorganically, naturally.
p69
aa(lp70
VIf you know anything about government technology,
p71
aVyou know that this isn't how it normally goes.
p72
aVProcuring software usually takes a couple of years.
p73
aVWe had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year
p74
aVthat took three people about two and a half months.
p75
aVIt was a way that parents could figure out
p76
aVwhich were the right public schools for their kids.
p77
aVWe were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels,
p78
aVit would have taken at least two years
p79
aVand it would have cost about two million dollars.
p80
aVAnd that's nothing.
p81
aVThere is one project in the California court system right now
p82
aVthat so far cost taxpayers
p83
aVtwo billion dollars,
p84
aVand it doesn't work.
p85
aVAnd there are projects like this
p86
aVat every level of government.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo an app that takes a couple of days to write
p89
aVand then spreads virally,
p90
aVthat's sort of a shot across the bow
p91
aVto the institution of government.
p92
aVIt suggests how government could work better \u2014
p93
aVnot more like a private company,
p94
aVas many people think it should.
p95
aVAnd not even like a tech company,
p96
aVbut more like the Internet itself.
p97
aVAnd that means permissionless,
p98
aVit means open, it means generative.
p99
aVAnd that's important.
p100
aVBut what's more important about this app
p101
aVis that it represents how a new generation
p102
aVis tackling the problem of government \u2014
p103
aVnot as the problem of an ossified institution,
p104
aVbut as a problem of collective action.
p105
aVAnd that's great news,
p106
aVbecause, it turns out, we're very good at collective action
p107
aVwith digital technology.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow there's a very large community of people
p110
aVthat are building the tools that we need
p111
aVto do things together effectively.
p112
aVIt's not just Code for America fellows,
p113
aVthere are hundreds of people all over the country
p114
aVthat are standing and writing civic apps
p115
aVevery day in their own communities.
p116
aVThey haven't given up on government.
p117
aVThey are frustrated as hell with it,
p118
aVbut they're not complaining about it,
p119
aVthey're fixing it.
p120
aVAnd these folks know something
p121
aVthat we've lost sight of.
p122
aVAnd that's that when you strip away all your feelings
p123
aVabout politics and the line at the DMV
p124
aVand all those other things
p125
aVthat we're really mad about,
p126
aVgovernment is, at its core,
p127
aVin the words of Tim O'Reilly,
p128
aV"What we do together that we can't do alone."
p129
aa(lp130
VNow a lot of people have given up on government.
p131
aVAnd if you're one of those people,
p132
aVI would ask that you reconsider,
p133
aVbecause things are changing.
p134
aVPolitics is not changing;
p135
aVgovernment is changing.
p136
aVAnd because government
p137
aVultimately derives its power from us \u2014
p138
aVremember "We the people?" \u2014
p139
aVhow we think about it
p140
aVis going to effect how that change happens.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.
p143
aVAnd like a lot of people,
p144
aVI thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.
p145
aVWell after two years, I've come to the conclusion
p146
aVthat, especially local government,
p147
aVis about opossums.
p148
aa(lp149
VThis is the call center for the services and information line.
p150
aVIt's generally where you will get
p151
aVif you call 311 in your city.
p152
aVIf you should ever have the chance
p153
aVto staff your city's call center,
p154
aVas our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program \u2014
p155
aVin fact, they all do that \u2014
p156
aVyou will find that people call government
p157
aVwith a very wide range of issues,
p158
aVincluding having an opossum stuck in your house.
p159
aVSo Scott gets this call.
p160
aVHe types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.
p161
aVHe doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.
p162
aVAnd finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house
p163
aVand play music really loud
p164
aVand see if the thing leaves?"
p165
aVSo that worked. So booya for Scott.
p166
aVBut that wasn't the end of the opossums.
p167
aa(lp168
VBoston doesn't just have a call center.
p169
aVIt has an app, a Web and mobile app,
p170
aVcalled Citizens Connect.
p171
aVNow we didn't write this app.
p172
aVThis is the work of the very smart people
p173
aVat the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
p174
aVSo one day \u2014 this is an actual report \u2014 this came in:
p175
aV"Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.
p176
aVHow do I get this removed?"
p177
aVBut what happens with Citizens Connect is different.
p178
aVSo Scott was speaking person-to-person.
p179
aVBut on Citizens Connect everything is public,
p180
aVso everybody can see this.
p181
aVAnd in this case, a neighbor saw it.
p182
aVAnd the next report we got said,
p183
aV"I walked over to this location,
p184
aVfound the trashcan behind the house.
p185
aVOpossum? Check. Living? Yep.
p186
aVTurned trashcan on its side. Walked home.
p187
aVGoodnight sweet opossum."
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VPretty simple.
p192
aVSo this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.
p193
aVAnd it's also a great example
p194
aVof government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.
p195
aVBut it's also a great example of government as a platform.
p196
aVAnd I don't mean necessarily
p197
aVa technological definition of platform here.
p198
aVI'm just talking about a platform for people
p199
aVto help themselves and to help others.
p200
aVSo one citizen helped another citizen,
p201
aVbut government played a key role here.
p202
aVIt connected those two people.
p203
aVAnd it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed,
p204
aVbut a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative
p205
aVto government services.
p206
aVWhen one neighbor helps another,
p207
aVwe strengthen our communities.
p208
aVWe call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow one of the important things we need to think about government
p211
aVis that it's not the same thing as politics.
p212
aVAnd most people get that,
p213
aVbut they think that one is the input to the other.
p214
aVThat our input to the system of government
p215
aVis voting.
p216
aVNow how many times have we elected a political leader \u2014
p217
aVand sometimes we spend a lot of energy
p218
aVgetting a new political leader elected \u2014
p219
aVand then we sit back and we expect government
p220
aVto reflect our values and meet our needs,
p221
aVand then not that much changes?
p222
aVThat's because government is like a vast ocean
p223
aVand politics is the six-inch layer on top.
p224
aVAnd what's under that
p225
aVis what we call bureaucracy.
p226
aVAnd we say that word with such contempt.
p227
aVBut it's that contempt
p228
aVthat keeps this thing that we own
p229
aVand we pay for
p230
aVas something that's working against us, this other thing,
p231
aVand then we're disempowering ourselves.
p232
aa(lp233
VPeople seem to think politics is sexy.
p234
aVIf we want this institution to work for us,
p235
aVwe're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.
p236
aVBecause that's where the real work of government happens.
p237
aVWe have to engage with the machinery of government.
p238
aVSo that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.
p239
aVHave you seen these guys?
p240
aVIt's a group of concerned citizens
p241
aVthat have written a very detailed
p242
aV325-page report
p243
aVthat's a response to the SEC's request for comment
p244
aVon the Financial Reform Bill.
p245
aVThat's not being politically active,
p246
aVthat's being bureaucratically active.
p247
aa(lp248
VNow for those of us who've given up on government,
p249
aVit's time that we asked ourselves
p250
aVabout the world that we want to leave for our children.
p251
aVYou have to see the enormous challenges
p252
aVthat they're going to face.
p253
aVDo we really think we're going to get where we need to go
p254
aVwithout fixing the one institution
p255
aVthat can act on behalf of all of us?
p256
aVWe can't do without government,
p257
aVbut we do need it
p258
aVto be more effective.
p259
aVThe good news is that technology is making it possible
p260
aVto fundamentally reframe
p261
aVthe function of government
p262
aVin a way that can actually scale
p263
aVby strengthening civil society.
p264
aVAnd there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet,
p265
aVand they know that it's not that hard
p266
aVto do things together,
p267
aVyou just have to architect the systems the right way.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow the average age of our fellows is 28,
p270
aVso I am, begrudgingly,
p271
aValmost a generation older than most of them.
p272
aVThis is a generation
p273
aVthat's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.
p274
aVThey're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting
p275
aVabout who gets to speak;
p276
aVthey all get to speak.
p277
aVThey can express their opinion
p278
aVon any channel at any time,
p279
aVand they do.
p280
aVSo when they're faced with the problem of government,
p281
aVthey don't care as much
p282
aVabout using their voices.
p283
aVThey're using their hands.
p284
aVThey're using their hands
p285
aVto write applications that make government work better.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd those applications let us use our hands
p288
aVto make our communities better.
p289
aVThat could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed,
p290
aVturning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.
p291
aVAnd certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along,
p292
aVand many people do.
p293
aVBut these apps are like little digital reminders
p294
aVthat we're not just consumers,
p295
aVand we're not just consumers of government,
p296
aVputting in our taxes and getting back services.
p297
aVWe're more than that,
p298
aVwe're citizens.
p299
aVAnd we're not going to fix government
p300
aVuntil we fix citizenship.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo the question I have for all of you here:
p303
aVWhen it comes to the big, important things
p304
aVthat we need to do together,
p305
aVall of us together,
p306
aVare we just going to be a crowd of voices,
p307
aVor are we also going to be
p308
aVa crowd of hands?
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Applause)

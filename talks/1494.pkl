VSo I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia.
p5
aVI've spent hundreds of days
p6
aVin psychiatric hospitals.
p7
aVI might have ended up spending
p8
aVmost of my life on the back ward of a hospital,
p9
aVbut that isn't how my life turned out.
p10
aVIn fact, I've managed to stay clear of hospitals
p11
aVfor almost three decades,
p12
aVperhaps my proudest accomplishment.
p13
aVThat's not to say that I've remained clear
p14
aVof all psychiatric struggles.
p15
aVAfter I graduated from the Yale Law School and
p16
aVgot my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White,
p17
aVannounced to me that he was going to close his practice
p18
aVin three months, several years
p19
aVbefore I had planned to leave New Haven.
p20
aVWhite had been enormously helpful to me,
p21
aVand the thought of his leaving
p22
aVshattered me.
p23
aa(lp24
VMy best friend Steve,
p25
aVsensing that something was terribly wrong,
p26
aVflew out to New Haven to be with me.
p27
aVNow I'm going to quote from some of my writings:
p28
aV"I opened the door to my studio apartment.
p29
aVSteve would later tell me that,
p30
aVfor all the times he had seen me psychotic, nothing
p31
aVcould have prepared him for what he saw that day.
p32
aVFor a week or more, I had barely eaten.
p33
aVI was gaunt. I walked
p34
aVas though my legs were wooden.
p35
aVMy face looked and felt like a mask.
p36
aVI had closed all the curtains in the apartment, so
p37
aVin the middle of the day
p38
aVthe apartment was in near total darkness.
p39
aVThe air was fetid, the room a shambles.
p40
aVSteve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated
p41
aVmany patients with severe mental illness, and to this day
p42
aVhe'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen.
p43
aV'Hi,' I said, and then I returned to the couch,
p44
aVwhere I sat in silence for several moments.
p45
aV'Thank you for coming, Steve.
p46
aVCrumbling world, word, voice.
p47
aVTell the clocks to stop.
p48
aVTime is. Time has come.'
p49
aV'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.
p50
aV'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.
p51
aV'Gravity is pulling me down.
p52
aVI'm scared. Tell them to get away.'"
p53
aa(lp54
VAs a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospital
p55
aVon three different occasions for lengthy periods.
p56
aVMy doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia,
p57
aVand gave me a prognosis of "grave."
p58
aVThat is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care,
p59
aVand work at menial jobs.
p60
aVFortunately, I did not actually
p61
aVenact that grave prognosis.
p62
aVInstead, I'm a chaired Professor of Law, Psychology
p63
aVand Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law,
p64
aVI have many close friends
p65
aVand I have a beloved husband, Will, who's here with us today.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Applause) Thank you.
p68
aVHe's definitely the star of my show.
p69
aa(lp70
VI'd like to share with you how that happened, and also
p71
aVdescribe my experience of being psychotic.
p72
aVI hasten to add that it's my experience,
p73
aVbecause everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.
p74
aa(lp75
VLet's start with the definition of schizophrenia.
p76
aVSchizophrenia is a brain disease.
p77
aVIts defining feature is psychosis, or being
p78
aVout of touch with reality.
p79
aVDelusions and hallucinations
p80
aVare hallmarks of the illness.
p81
aVDelusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive
p82
aVto evidence, and hallucinations are false sensory experiences.
p83
aVFor example, when I'm psychotic I often have
p84
aVthe delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands
p85
aVof people with my thoughts.
p86
aVI sometimes have the idea that
p87
aVnuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.
p88
aVOccasionally, I have hallucinations,
p89
aVlike one time I turned around and saw a man
p90
aVwith a raised knife.
p91
aVImagine having a nightmare while you're awake.
p92
aa(lp93
VOften, speech and thinking become disorganized
p94
aVto the point of incoherence.
p95
aVLoose associations involves putting together words
p96
aVthat may sound a lot alike but don't make sense,
p97
aVand if the words get jumbled up enough, it's called "word salad."
p98
aVContrary to what many people think, schizophrenia is not
p99
aVthe same as multiple personality disorder or split personality.
p100
aVThe schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered.
p101
aa(lp102
VEveryone has seen a street person,
p103
aVunkempt, probably ill-fed,
p104
aVstanding outside of an office building muttering
p105
aVto himself or shouting.
p106
aVThis person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia.
p107
aVBut schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array
p108
aVof socioeconomic status, and there are people
p109
aVwith the illness who are full-time professionals
p110
aVwith major responsibilities.
p111
aVSeveral years ago, I decided
p112
aVto write down my experiences and my personal journey,
p113
aVand I want to share some more of that story with you today
p114
aVto convey the inside view.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo the following episode happened the seventh week
p117
aVof my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School.
p118
aVQuoting from my writings:
p119
aV"My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the date
p120
aVto meet in the law school library on Friday night
p121
aVto work on our memo assignment together.
p122
aVBut we didn't get far before I was talking in ways
p123
aVthat made no sense.
p124
aa(lp125
V'Memos are visitations,' I informed them.
p126
aV'They make certain points. The point is on your head.
p127
aVPat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?'
p128
aVRebel and Val looked at me
p129
aVas if they or I had been
p130
aVsplashed in the face with cold water.
p131
aV'What are you talking about, Elyn?'
p132
aV'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who,
p133
aVheaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof.
p134
aVIt's a flat surface. It's safe.'
p135
aVRebel and Val followed
p136
aVand they asked what had gotten into me.
p137
aV'This is the real me,' I announced,
p138
aVwaving my arms above my head.
p139
aVAnd then, late on a Friday night, on the roof
p140
aVof the Yale Law School,
p141
aVI began to sing, and not quietly either.
p142
aV'Come to the Florida sunshine bush.
p143
aVDo you want to dance?'
p144
aV'Are you on drugs?' one asked. 'Are you high?'
p145
aV'High? Me? No way, no drugs.
p146
aVCome to the Florida sunshine bush,
p147
aVwhere there are lemons, where they make demons.'
p148
aV'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val
p149
aVheaded back into the library.
p150
aVI shrugged and followed them.
p151
aa(lp152
VBack inside, I asked my classmates if they were
p153
aVhaving the same experience of words jumping around
p154
aVour cases as I was.
p155
aV'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases,' I said.
p156
aV'We've got to case the joint.
p157
aVI don't believe in joints, but
p158
aVthey do hold your body together.'" \u2014
p159
aVIt's an example of loose associations. \u2014
p160
aV"Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room,
p161
aVand once there, I couldn't settle down.
p162
aVMy head was too full of noise,
p163
aVtoo full of orange trees and law memos I could not write
p164
aVand mass murders I knew I would be responsible for.
p165
aVSitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth,
p166
aVmoaning in fear and isolation."
p167
aVThis episode led to my first hospitalization in America.
p168
aVI had two earlier in England.
p169
aa(lp170
VContinuing with the writings:
p171
aV"The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask
p172
aVfor an extension on the memo assignment,
p173
aVand I began gibbering unintelligably
p174
aVas I had the night before,
p175
aVand he eventually brought me to the emergency room.
p176
aVOnce there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor'
p177
aVand his whole team of goons swooped down,
p178
aVlifted me high into the air,
p179
aVand slammed me down on a metal bed
p180
aVwith such force that I saw stars.
p181
aVThen they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed
p182
aVwith thick leather straps.
p183
aVA sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before:
p184
aVhalf groan, half scream,
p185
aVbarely human and pure terror.
p186
aVThen the sound came again,
p187
aVforced from somewhere deep inside my belly
p188
aVand scraping my throat raw."
p189
aVThis incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.
p190
aVOne of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me
p191
aVagainst my will was that I was
p192
aV"gravely disabled."
p193
aVTo support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable
p194
aVto do my Yale Law School homework.
p195
aVI wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VDuring the next year, I would
p199
aVspend five months in a psychiatric hospital.
p200
aVAt times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints,
p201
aVarms tied, arms and legs tied down,
p202
aVarms and legs tied down with a net tied
p203
aVtightly across my chest.
p204
aVI never struck anyone.
p205
aVI never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.
p206
aVIf you've never been restrained yourself, you may have
p207
aVa benign image of the experience.
p208
aVThere's nothing benign about it.
p209
aa(lp210
VEvery week in the United States,
p211
aVit's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints.
p212
aVThey strangle, they aspirate their vomit,
p213
aVthey suffocate, they have a heart attack.
p214
aVIt's unclear whether using mechanical restraints
p215
aVis actually saving lives or costing lives.
p216
aVWhile I was preparing to write my student note
p217
aVfor the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints,
p218
aVI consulted an eminent law professor who was also
p219
aVa psychiatrist,
p220
aVand said surely he would agree
p221
aVthat restraints must be degrading,
p222
aVpainful and frightening.
p223
aVHe looked at me in a knowing way, and said,
p224
aV"Elyn, you don't really understand:
p225
aVThese people are psychotic.
p226
aVThey're different from me and you.
p227
aVThey wouldn't experience restraints as we would."
p228
aVI didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that,
p229
aVno, we're not that different from him.
p230
aVWe don't like to be strapped down to a bed
p231
aVand left to suffer for hours any more than he would.
p232
aVIn fact, until very recently,
p233
aVand I'm sure some people still hold it as a view,
p234
aVthat restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.
p235
aVI've never met a psychiatric patient
p236
aVwho agreed with that view.
p237
aVToday, I'd like to say I'm very pro-psychiatry
p238
aVbut very anti-force.
p239
aVI don't think force is effective as treatment, and I think
p240
aVusing force is a terrible thing to do to another person
p241
aVwith a terrible illness.
p242
aa(lp243
VEventually, I came to Los Angeles
p244
aVto teach at the University of Southern California Law School.
p245
aVFor years, I had resisted medication,
p246
aVmaking many, many efforts to get off.
p247
aVI felt that if I could manage without medication,
p248
aVI could prove that, after all,
p249
aVI wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.
p250
aVMy motto was the less medicine, the less defective.
p251
aVMy L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me
p252
aVjust to stay on medication and get on with my life,
p253
aVbut I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off.
p254
aVQuoting from the text:
p255
aV"I started the reduction of my meds, and within a short time
p256
aVI began feeling the effects.
p257
aVAfter returning from a trip to Oxford, I marched into
p258
aVKaplan's office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down,
p259
aVcovered my face, and began shaking.
p260
aVAll around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.
p261
aVThey'd slice me up in thin slices
p262
aVor make me swallow hot coals.
p263
aVKaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.'
p264
aVEven in this state, what he accurately described as
p265
aVacutely and forwardly psychotic,
p266
aVI refused to take more medication.
p267
aVThe mission is not yet complete.
p268
aa(lp269
VImmediately after the appointment with Kaplan,
p270
aVI went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert
p271
aVwho was following me for medication side effects.
p272
aVHe was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.
p273
aVOnce in his office, I sat on his couch, folded over,
p274
aVand began muttering.
p275
aV'Head explosions and people trying to kill.
p276
aVIs it okay if I totally trash your office?'
p277
aV'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,'
p278
aVsaid Marder.
p279
aV'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me.
p280
aVTell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong?
p281
aVHundreds of thousands with thoughts, interdiction.'
p282
aV'Elyn, do you feel like you're
p283
aVdangerous to yourself or others?
p284
aVI think you need to be in the hospital.
p285
aVI could get you admitted right away, and the whole thing
p286
aVcould be very discrete.'
p287
aV'Ha, ha, ha.
p288
aVYou're offering to put me in hospitals?
p289
aVHospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.
p290
aVOne must stay away. I'm God, or I used to be.'"
p291
aVAt that point in the text,
p292
aVwhere I said "I'm God, or I used to be," my husband
p293
aVmade a marginal note.
p294
aVHe said, "Did you quit or were you fired?"
p295
aV(Laughter)
p296
aV"'I give life and I take it away.
p297
aVForgive me, for I know not what I do.'
p298
aa(lp299
VEventually, I broke down in front of friends, and
p300
aVeverybody convinced me to take more medication.
p301
aVI could no longer deny the truth,
p302
aVand I could not change it.
p303
aVThe wall that kept me, Elyn, Professor Saks,
p304
aVseparate from that insane woman hospitalized years past,
p305
aVlay smashed and in ruins."
p306
aa(lp307
VEverything about this illness says I shouldn't be here,
p308
aVbut I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons:
p309
aVFirst, I've had excellent treatment.
p310
aVFour- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy
p311
aVfor decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology.
p312
aVSecond, I have many close family members and friends who know me
p313
aVand know my illness.
p314
aVThese relationships have given my life a meaning
p315
aVand a depth, and they also helped me navigate
p316
aVmy life in the face of symptoms.
p317
aVThird, I work at an enormously supportive workplace
p318
aVat USC Law School.
p319
aVThis is a place that not only accommodates my needs
p320
aVbut actually embraces them.
p321
aVIt's also a very intellectually stimulating place,
p322
aVand occupying my mind with complex problems
p323
aVhas been my best and most powerful and most reliable
p324
aVdefense against my mental illness.
p325
aa(lp326
VEven with all that \u2014 excellent treatment, wonderful family and
p327
aVfriends, supportive work environment \u2014
p328
aVI did not make my illness public
p329
aVuntil relatively late in life,
p330
aVand that's because the stigma against mental illness
p331
aVis so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing.
p332
aVIf you hear nothing else today,
p333
aVplease hear this: There are not "schizophrenics."
p334
aVThere are people with schizophrenia, and these people
p335
aVmay be your spouse, they may be your child,
p336
aVthey may be your neighbor, they may be your friend,
p337
aVthey may be your coworker.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo let me share some final thoughts.
p340
aVWe need to invest more resources into research and treatment
p341
aVof mental illness.
p342
aVThe better we understand these illnesses, the better
p343
aVthe treatments we can provide, and the better the treatments
p344
aVwe can provide, the more we can offer people care,
p345
aVand not have to use force.
p346
aVAlso, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.
p347
aVIt's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail
p348
aVis the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.
p349
aVAmerican prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer
p350
aVfrom severe mental illness, and many of them are there
p351
aVbecause they never received adequate treatment.
p352
aVI could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself.
p353
aVA message to the entertainment industry and to the press:
p354
aVOn the whole, you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma
p355
aVand prejudice of many kinds.
p356
aVPlease, continue to let us see characters in your movies,
p357
aVyour plays, your columns,
p358
aVwho suffer with severe mental illness.
p359
aVPortray them sympathetically,
p360
aVand portray them in all the richness and depth
p361
aVof their experience as people and not as diagnoses.
p362
aa(lp363
VRecently, a friend posed a question:
p364
aVIf there were a pill I could take
p365
aVthat would instantly cure me, would I take it?
p366
aVThe poet Rainer Maria Rilke
p367
aVwas offered psychoanalysis.
p368
aVHe declined, saying, "Don't take my devils away,
p369
aVbecause my angels may flee too."
p370
aVMy psychosis, on the other hand,
p371
aVis a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying
p372
aVthat all my angels have already fled.
p373
aVSo would I take the pill? In an instant.
p374
aVThat said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting
p375
aVthe life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill,
p376
aVnor am I asking anyone for their pity.
p377
aVWhat I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share
p378
aVis more important than the mental illness we may not.
p379
aVWhat those of us who suffer with mental illness want
p380
aVis what everybody wants:
p381
aVin the words of Sigmund Freud, "to work and to love."
p382
aa(lp383
VThank you. (Applause)
p384
aa(lp385
V(Applause)
p386
aa(lp387
VThank you. Thank you. You're very kind. (Applause)
p388
aa(lp389
VThank you. (Applause)

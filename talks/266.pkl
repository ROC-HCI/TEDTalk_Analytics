VBeing a child, and sort of crawling around the house,
p5
aVI remember these Turkish carpets,
p6
aVand there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.
p7
aVI mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear
p8
aVfrom this soldier.
p9
aVAnd my mom took these pictures actually, last week,
p10
aVof our carpets, and I remember this to this day.
p11
aVThere was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture
p12
aVwith creatures and gargoyles and nudity \u2014
p13
aVpretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhat I remember today from this is that objects tell stories,
p16
aVso storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.
p17
aVAnd then there was another influence.
p18
aVI was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers,
p19
aVwe want to just do what we love and what we believe in.
p20
aVAnd so,
p21
aVI fused together the two things I loved the most,
p22
aVwhich was skiing and windsurfing.
p23
aVThose are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, I created this compilation of the two:
p26
aVI took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there,
p27
aVand some foot straps, and some metal fins,
p28
aVand here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.
p29
aVIt was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible,
p30
aVit worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.
p31
aVAnd I realized then I had to go to design school.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVI mean, look at those graphics there.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, I went to design school,
p37
aVand it was the early '90s when I finished.
p38
aVAnd I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley,
p39
aVso I wanted to be there,
p40
aVand I saw that the computer was coming into our homes,
p41
aVthat it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.
p42
aVAnd so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy,
p43
aVand we would get in to these meetings,
p44
aVand these managers would come in,
p45
aVand they would say,
p46
aV"Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."
p47
aVAnd they would give the projects code names, you know,
p48
aVmostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.
p49
aVSo, in anticipation, I would be this young designer
p50
aVin the back of the room, and I would raise my hand,
p51
aVand I would ask questions.
p52
aVI mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions,
p53
aVbut things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"
p54
aVor "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing?
p55
aV"You know, do people really use it?
p56
aVDo they need it? Do they want it in their homes?"
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VWhat I realized then is, they didn't really want to change
p60
aVthe legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.
p61
aVThey were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins,
p62
aVto put some pretty stuff outside of the box.
p63
aVAnd I didn't want to be a colorist.
p64
aVIt wasn't what I wanted to do.
p65
aVI didn't want to be a stylist in this way.
p66
aVAnd then I saw this quote:
p67
aV"advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VSo, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco,
p71
aVand I started a little company, fuseproject.
p72
aVAnd what I wanted to work on is important stuff.
p73
aVAnd I wanted to really not just work on the skins,
p74
aVbut I wanted to work on the entire human experience.
p75
aVAnd so the first projects were sort of humble,
p76
aVbut they took technology and maybe made it into things
p77
aVthat people would use in a new way,
p78
aVand maybe finding some new functionality.
p79
aa(lp80
VThis is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company,
p81
aVright when it launched,
p82
aVand it's the first watch that has a display
p83
aVthat switches from horizontal to vertical.
p84
aVAnd that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,
p85
aVwithout bending my elbow.
p86
aVAnd other projects, which were really about transformation,
p87
aVabout matching the human need.
p88
aVThis is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,
p89
aVand it ships completely flat,
p90
aVand then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.
p91
aVAnd something a little bit more experimental:
p92
aVthis is a light fixture for Swarovski,
p93
aVand what it does is, it changes shape.
p94
aVSo, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.
p95
aVAnd just by drawing on a little computer tablet,
p96
aVthe entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.
p99
aVThis is a pretty involved process;
p100
aVit took us about four and a half years.
p101
aVBut I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,
p102
aVa new experience of light.
p103
aVSo, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.
p104
aVAnd that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.
p105
aVAnd the new experience I was looking for
p106
aVis giving the choice for the user to go from
p107
aVa warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,
p108
aVall the way to a bright work light.
p109
aVSo, the light bulb actually does that.
p110
aVIt allows the person to switch,
p111
aVand to mix these two colorations.
p112
aVAnd it's done in a very simple way:
p113
aVone just touches the base of the light,
p114
aVand on one side, you can mix the brightness,
p115
aVand on the other, the coloration of the light.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them,
p118
aVand I think as designers we need to really think
p119
aVabout how we can create a different relationship
p120
aVbetween our work and the world,
p121
aVwhether it's for business,
p122
aVor, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.
p123
aVBecause I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring
p124
aVvalue to business, value to the users also,
p125
aVbut I think it's the values that we put into these projects
p126
aVthat ultimately create the greater value.
p127
aVAnd the values we bring
p128
aVcan be about environmental issues,
p129
aVabout sustainability, about lower power consumption.
p130
aVYou know, they can be about function and beauty;
p131
aVthey can be about business strategy.
p132
aVBut designers are really the glue
p133
aVthat brings these things together.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with,
p136
aVand it has a humanistic technology.
p137
aVIt feels your skin. It rests on your skin,
p138
aVand it knows when it is you're talking.
p139
aVAnd by knowing when it is you're talking,
p140
aVit gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,
p141
aVwhich is the environmental noises.
p142
aa(lp143
VBut the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone
p144
aVis that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,
p145
aVand all the nerdy stuff out of it,
p146
aVand try to make it as beautiful as we can.
p147
aVI mean, think about it:
p148
aVthe care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,
p149
aVor accessories is really important,
p150
aVso if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.
p151
aVAnd this is what we're pursuing here.
p152
aa(lp153
VBut how we work on Jawbone is really unique.
p154
aVI want to point at something here, on the left.
p155
aVThis is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside
p156
aVthat makes this technology work.
p157
aVBut this is the design process:
p158
aVthere's somebody changing the board,
p159
aVputting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,
p160
aVas the designers on the other side are doing the work.
p161
aVSo, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.
p162
aVIt's really about designing from the inside out.
p163
aVAnd then, on the other side of the room,
p164
aVthe designers are making small adjustments,
p165
aVsketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.
p166
aVAnd it's what I call being design driven.
p167
aVYou know, there is some push and pull,
p168
aVbut design is really helping define
p169
aVthe whole experience from the inside out.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd then, of course, design is never done.
p172
aVAnd this is \u2014 the other new way that is unique
p173
aVin how we work is, because it's never done,
p174
aVyou have to do all this other stuff.
p175
aVThe packaging, and the website, and you need to continue
p176
aVto really touch the user, in many ways.
p177
aVBut how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?
p178
aVAnd Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,
p179
aVyou know, really understands that you need a different structure.
p180
aVSo, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,
p181
aVit's a partnership. We can continue to work
p182
aVand dedicate ourselves to this project,
p183
aVand then we also share in the rewards.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd here's another project, another partnership-type approach.
p186
aVThis is called Y Water,
p187
aVand it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,
p188
aVAustrian originally, who came to us,
p189
aVand all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,
p190
aVor an organic drink for his kids,
p191
aVto replace the high-sugar-content sodas
p192
aVthat he's trying to get them away from.
p193
aVSo, we worked on this bottle,
p194
aVand it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.
p195
aVAnd this allows the bottle to turn into a game.
p196
aVThe bottles connect together,
p197
aVand you can create different shapes, different forms.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aV(Applause)
p200
aVThank you.
p201
aV(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd then while we were doing this,
p204
aVthe shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,
p205
aVand then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not,"
p206
aVare probably the most important words that kids ask.
p207
aVSo we called it Y Water. And so this is
p208
aVanother place where it all comes together in the same room:
p209
aVthe three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,
p210
aVit all becomes deeply connected.
p211
aVAnd then the other thing about this project is,
p212
aVwe bring intellectual property,
p213
aVwe bring a marketing approach,
p214
aVwe bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,
p215
aVwhat we bring is these values,
p216
aVand these values create a soul for the companies we work with.
p217
aVAnd it's especially rewarding when your design work
p218
aVbecomes a creative endeavor,
p219
aVwhen others can be creative and do more with it.
p220
aa(lp221
VHere's another project,
p222
aVwhich I think really emulates that.
p223
aVThis is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.
p224
aVThis picture is incredible.
p225
aVIn Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.
p226
aVThis girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.
p227
aVI mean, to me, it just means so much.
p228
aVBut when Nicholas Negroponte \u2014
p229
aVand he has spoken about this project a lot,
p230
aVhe's the founder of OLPC \u2014 came to us
p231
aVabout two and a half years ago,
p232
aVthere were some clear ideas.
p233
aVHe wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,
p234
aVand those are pillars of his life,
p235
aVbut also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.
p236
aVBut the third pillar that he talked about was design.
p237
aVAnd at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.
p238
aVI didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.
p239
aVBut what he said was really significant,
p240
aVis that design was going to be why the kids
p241
aVwere going to love this product,
p242
aVhow we were going to make it low cost, robust.
p243
aVAnd plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key \u2014
p244
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p245
aVand the Num Lock key, too.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic,
p248
aVto look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.
p249
aVAnd then the integration of
p250
aVall these great technologies, which you've heard about,
p251
aVthe Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;
p252
aVthe screen, which you can read in sunlight;
p253
aVthe keyboard, which is made out of rubber,
p254
aVand it's protected from the environment.
p255
aa(lp256
VYou know, all these great technologies really happened
p257
aVbecause of the passion and
p258
aVthe OLPC people and the engineers.
p259
aVThey fought the suppliers,
p260
aVthey fought the manufacturers.
p261
aVI mean, they fought like animals
p262
aVfor this to remain they way it is.
p263
aVAnd in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one \u2014
p264
aVallows the process
p265
aVfrom not destroying the original idea.
p266
aVAnd I think this is something really important.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo, now you get these pictures \u2014
p269
aVyou get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria
p270
aVand you see them in Uruguay
p271
aVwith their computers, and in Mongolia.
p272
aVAnd we went away from obviously the beige.
p273
aVI mean it's colorful, it's fun.
p274
aVIn fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.
p275
aVIt's because we were able
p276
aVto run, during the manufacturing process,
p277
aV20 colors for the X and the O,
p278
aVwhich is the name of the computer,
p279
aVand by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,
p280
aVyou get 20 times 20: you get
p281
aV400 different options there.
p282
aVSo, the lessons from seeing the kids
p283
aVusing them in the developing world are incredible.
p284
aa(lp285
VBut this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland,
p286
aVand he had the laptop for an afternoon,
p287
aVand I had to take it back. It was hard.
p288
aV(Laughter)
p289
aVAnd it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,
p290
aVI come back to Switzerland,
p291
aVand there he is playing with his own version.
p292
aV(Laughter)
p293
aVLike paper, paper and cardboard.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo, I'm going to finish with one last project,
p296
aVand this is a little bit more of adult play.
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aVSome of you might have heard about the New York City condom.
p299
aVIt's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,
p300
aVFebruary 14, about 10 days ago.
p301
aVSo, the Department of Health in New York came to us,
p302
aVand they needed a way to distribute
p303
aV36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.
p304
aVSo a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.
p305
aVThese are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.
p306
aVIt's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,
p307
aVand it has to be easily serviceable:
p308
aVyou have to know where it is and what it does.
p309
aVAnd we also designed the condoms themselves.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd I was just in New York at the launch,
p312
aVand I went to see all these places where they're installed:
p313
aVthis is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;
p314
aVat a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.
p315
aVI mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics \u2014 everywhere.
p316
aVOf course, clubs and discos, too.
p317
aVAnd here's the public service announcement for this project.
p318
aV(Music)
p319
aV(Laughter)
p320
aVGet some.
p321
aV(Applause)
p322
aa(lp323
VSo, this is really where design
p324
aVis able to create a conversation.
p325
aVI was in these venues, and people were,
p326
aVyou know, really into getting them. They were excited.
p327
aVIt was breaking the ice,
p328
aVit was getting over a stigma,
p329
aVand I think that's also what design can do.
p330
aVSo, I was going to
p331
aVthrow some condoms in the room and whatnot,
p332
aVbut I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.
p333
aV(Laughter)
p334
aVYeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.
p335
aV(Laughter)
p336
aV(Applause)
p337
aVSo, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aVAnd if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom,
p340
aVyou can just say you like the design.
p341
aV(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VSo, I'll finish with just one thought:
p344
aVif we all work together on creating value,
p345
aVbut if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,
p346
aVI think we can change the work that we do.
p347
aVWe can change these values, can change the companies we work with,
p348
aVand eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.
p349
aVSo, thank you.
p350

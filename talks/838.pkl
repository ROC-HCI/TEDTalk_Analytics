VOne of the things that
p5
aVdefines a TEDster
p6
aVis you've taken your passion,
p7
aVand you've turned it into stewardship.
p8
aVYou actually put action to the issues you care about.
p9
aVBut what you're going to find eventually is
p10
aVyou may need to actually get elected officials
p11
aVto help you out.
p12
aVSo, how do you do that?
p13
aa(lp14
VOne of the things I should probably tell you is,
p15
aVI worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,
p16
aVand that sort of warped my framework.
p17
aVSo, when you start to think about politicians,
p18
aVyou've got to realize these are strange creatures.
p19
aVOther than the fact that they can't tell directions,
p20
aVand they have very strange breeding habits,
p21
aVhow do you actually work with these things? (Laughter)
p22
aVWhat we need to understand is:
p23
aVWhat drives the political creature?
p24
aVAnd there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:
p25
aVOne is reputation and influence.
p26
aVThese are the primary tools by which
p27
aVa politician can do his job.
p28
aVThe second one \u2014 unlike most animals,
p29
aVwhich is survival of the species \u2014
p30
aVthis is preservation of self.
p31
aVNow you may think it's money,
p32
aVbut that's actually sort of a proxy
p33
aVto what I can do to preserve myself.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, the challenge with you moving your issue forward
p36
aVis these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.
p37
aVSo, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?
p38
aVYou can send them an email.
p39
aVWell, unfortunately, I've got so many
p40
aVViagra ads coming at me,
p41
aVyour email is lost.
p42
aVIt doesn't matter, it's spam.
p43
aVHow about you get on the phone?
p44
aVWell, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone,
p45
aV"Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."
p46
aVThat doesn't move.
p47
aVFace to face would work,
p48
aVbut it's hard to set it up.
p49
aVIt's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.
p50
aVYes, contributions actually do make a difference
p51
aVand they set a context for having a conversation,
p52
aVbut it takes some time to build up.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo what actually works?
p55
aVAnd the answer is rather strange.
p56
aVIt's a letter.
p57
aVWe live in a digital world,
p58
aVbut we're fairly analog creatures.
p59
aVLetters actually work.
p60
aVEven the top dog himself
p61
aVtakes time every day to read 10 letters
p62
aVthat are picked out by staff.
p63
aVI can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with
p64
aVwill tell you about the letters they get
p65
aVand what they mean.
p66
aVSo, how are you going to write your letter?
p67
aVFirst of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.
p68
aVI know these are tough, and you may have a hard time
p69
aVgetting your hand bent around it, (Laughter)
p70
aVbut this is actually critical.
p71
aVAnd it is critical that
p72
aVyou actually handwrite your letter.
p73
aVIt is so novel to see this,
p74
aVthat somebody actually picked up an analog device
p75
aVand has written to me.
p76
aVSecond of all, I'm going to recommend that
p77
aVyou get into a proactive stance
p78
aVand write to your elected officials at least once a month.
p79
aVHere's my promise to you:
p80
aVIf you are consistent and do this,
p81
aVwithin three months the elected official will start calling you
p82
aVwhen that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, I'm going to give you
p85
aVa four paragraph format to work with.
p86
aVNow, when you approach these animals,
p87
aVyou need to understand there's a dangerous end to them,
p88
aVand you also need to approach them
p89
aVwith some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.
p90
aVSo in paragraph number one,
p91
aVwhat I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this:
p92
aVYou appreciate them.
p93
aVYou may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,
p94
aVbut maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.
p95
aVWhen animals are going to make a point, they make the point.
p96
aVThey don't spend a lot of time dicking around.
p97
aVSo, here you go. (Laughter)
p98
aVParagraph number two:
p99
aVYou may actually have to just get very blunt
p100
aVand say what's really on your mind.
p101
aVWhen you do this,
p102
aVdon't attack people;
p103
aVyou attack tactics.
p104
aVAd hominem attacks will get you nowhere.
p105
aVParagraph number three:
p106
aVWhen animals are attacked or cornered,
p107
aVthey will fight to the death,
p108
aVso you have to give them an exit.
p109
aVMost of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.
p110
aV"Obviously, you're intelligent.
p111
aVIf you had the right information,
p112
aVyou would have done the right thing." (Laughter)
p113
aVLastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.
p114
aVYou're the safe place to come in to.
p115
aVSo, in paragraph number four,
p116
aVyou're going to tell people,
p117
aV"If no one is providing you with this information, let me help." (Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VAnimals do displays. They do two things:
p120
aVThey warn you or they try to attract you
p121
aVand say, "We need to mate."
p122
aVYou're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.
p123
aVYou do a number of things: you're a vice president,
p124
aVyou volunteer, you do something else.
p125
aVWhy is is this important?
p126
aVBecause this establishes the two
p127
aVprimary criteria for the political creature:
p128
aVthat you have influence in a large sphere,
p129
aVand that my preservation depends on you.
p130
aa(lp131
VHere is one very quick hack,
p132
aVespecially for the feds in the audience.
p133
aVHere's how you mail your letter.
p134
aVFirst of all, you send the original to the district office.
p135
aVSo, you send the copy to the main office.
p136
aVIf they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"
p137
aVThen some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler
p138
aVand says, "Oh, this is an important letter."
p139
aVAnd you actually get into the folder
p140
aVthat the elected official actually has to read.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo, what your letter means:
p143
aVI've got to tell you, we are all in a party,
p144
aVand political officials are the pinatas.
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVWe are harangued, lectured to,
p147
aVsold, marketed,
p148
aVbut a letter is actually one of the few times
p149
aVthat we have honest communication.
p150
aVI got this letter when I was first elected,
p151
aVand I still carry it to
p152
aVevery council meeting I go to.
p153
aVThis is an opportunity at real dialogue,
p154
aVand if you have stewardship
p155
aVand want to communicate,
p156
aVthat dialogue is incredibly powerful.
p157
aVSo when you do that, here's what I can promise:
p158
aVYou're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.
p159
aa(lp160
VGet writing.

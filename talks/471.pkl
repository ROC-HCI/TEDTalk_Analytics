VThis is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs
p5
aVI'm going to show you today.
p6
aVIt was taken 18 years ago.
p7
aVI was 19 years old at the time.
p8
aVI had just returned
p9
aVfrom one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time \u2014
p10
aVa little over 200 feet.
p11
aVAnd I had caught this little fish.
p12
aVIt turns out that particular one was the first of its kind
p13
aVever taken alive.
p14
aVI'm not just an ichthyologist, I'm a bona fide fish nerd.
p15
aVAnd to a fish nerd, this is some pretty exciting stuff.
p16
aVMore exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo
p17
aVis a guy named Jack Randall,
p18
aVthe greatest living ichthyologist on earth \u2014
p19
aVthe Grand Poobah of fish nerds, if you will.
p20
aVAnd so, it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time.
p21
aVIt set the course for the rest of my life.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut really, the most significant, most profound thing about this picture
p24
aVis it was taken two days before I was completely paralyzed
p25
aVfrom the neck down.
p26
aVI made a really stupid kind of mistake
p27
aVthat most 19-year-old males do when they think they're immortal,
p28
aVand I got a bad case of the bends and was paralyzed,
p29
aVand had to be flown back for treatment.
p30
aVI learned two really important things that day.
p31
aVThe first thing I learned \u2014 well, I'm mortal. That's a really big one.
p32
aVAnd the second thing I learned was that I knew, with profound certainty,
p33
aVthat this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life.
p34
aVI had to focus all my energies
p35
aVtowards going to find new species of things
p36
aVdown on deep coral reefs.
p37
aa(lp38
VWhen you think of a coral reef, this is what most people think of:
p39
aVthese big, hard, elaborate corals,
p40
aVlots of bright, colorful fishes and things.
p41
aVBut this is really just the tip of the iceberg.
p42
aVIf you look at this diagram of a coral reef,
p43
aVwe know a lot about that part up near the top.
p44
aVThe reason we know so much about it
p45
aVis scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it.
p46
aa(lp47
VThere is a problem with scuba, though,
p48
aVin that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go.
p49
aVIt turns out that depth is about 200 feet.
p50
aVI'll get into why that is in just a minute,
p51
aVbut the point is, scuba divers generally stay less than 100 feet deep,
p52
aVand very rarely go much below this, at least, not with any kind of sanity.
p53
aVSo to go deeper, most biologists have turned to submersibles.
p54
aVNow, submersibles are great, wonderful things,
p55
aVbut if you're going to spend 30,000 dollars a day to use one of these things
p56
aVand it's capable of going 2,000 feet,
p57
aVyou're not going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet,
p58
aVyou're going to go way down deep.
p59
aVSo the bottom line is, almost all research using submersibles
p60
aVhas taken place well below 500 feet.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, it's pretty obvious at this point
p63
aVthere's a zone here in the middle.
p64
aVThat's the zone
p65
aVthat centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness.
p66
aVI want to find out what's in this zone; we know almost nothing about it.
p67
aVScuba divers can't get there, submarines go right on past it.
p68
aa(lp69
VIt took me a year to learn to walk again after my diving accident in Palau.
p70
aVDuring that year,
p71
aVI spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving
p72
aVand how to overcome these limitations.
p73
aVI'm just going to show you a basic idea.
p74
aVWe're all breathing air right now.
p75
aVAir is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen,
p76
aV20 percent oxygen, 80 percent nitrogen.
p77
aVIt's in our lungs.
p78
aVAnd there's a phenomenon called Henry's law,
p79
aVthat says gases will dissolve into a fluid
p80
aVin proportion to the partial pressures you're exposing them to.
p81
aVSo, basically the gas dissolves into our body.
p82
aVThe oxygen is bound by metabolism, we use it for energy.
p83
aVThe nitrogen sort of floats around in our blood and tissues.
p84
aVThat's fine, it's how we're designed.
p85
aVThe problem happens when you go underwater.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe deeper you go underwater, the higher the pressure is.
p88
aVIf you were to go down to a depth of about 130 feet,
p89
aVwhich is the recommended limit for most scuba divers,
p90
aVyou'd get this pressure effect.
p91
aVThe effect of that pressure is you have an increased density of gas molecules
p92
aVin every breath you take.
p93
aVOver time, those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues
p94
aVand start to fill you up.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow, if you were to go down to, say, 300 feet,
p97
aVyou don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs,
p98
aVyou've got 10 times as many gas molecules in your lungs.
p99
aVAnd, sure enough, they dissolve into your blood and tissues as well.
p100
aVAnd if you were to go down to where there's 15 times as much \u2014
p101
aVthe deeper you go, the more exacerbating the problem becomes.
p102
aVThe limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body,
p103
aVall the nitrogen and all the oxygen.
p104
aa(lp105
VThere are three basic limitations of scuba diving.
p106
aVThe first limitation is the oxygen \u2014
p107
aVoxygen toxicity.
p108
aVNow, we all know the song: "Love is like oxygen.
p109
aVYou get too much, you get too high. Not enough, and you're gonna die."
p110
aVWell, in the context of diving, you get too much, you die also.
p111
aVYou die because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure.
p112
aVIt makes you convulse underwater \u2014 not a good thing to happen underwater.
p113
aVIt happens because there's too much concentration of oxygen in your body.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe nitrogen has two problems.
p116
aVOne of them is what Jacques Cousteau called "rapture of the deep."
p117
aVIt's nitrogen narcosis.
p118
aVIt makes you loopy; the deeper you go, the loopier you get.
p119
aVYou don't want to drive drunk, you don't want to dive drunk.
p120
aVSo that's a real big problem.
p121
aVAnd of course, the third problem
p122
aVis the one I found out the hard way in Palau,
p123
aVwhich is the bends.
p124
aa(lp125
VOne thing I forgot to mention
p126
aVis that to obviate the problem of nitrogen narcosis \u2014
p127
aVall of those blue dots in our body \u2014
p128
aVyou remove the nitrogen and replace it with helium.
p129
aVHelium's a gas; there're a lot of reasons why helium's good,
p130
aVit's a tiny molecule, it's inert, it doesn't give you narcosis.
p131
aVSo that's the basic concept we use.
p132
aVBut the theory's relatively easy.
p133
aVThe tricky part is the implementation.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo this is how I began about 15 years ago.
p136
aVI'll admit, it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts,
p137
aVbut you've got to start somewhere.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VAt the time, I wasn't the only one who didn't know what I was doing.
p142
aVAlmost nobody did.
p143
aVThis rig was actually used for a dive of 300 feet.
p144
aVBut over time we got better at it,
p145
aVand we came up with this really sophisticated-looking rig
p146
aVwith four scuba tanks, five regulators and all the right gas mixtures,
p147
aVall that good stuff.
p148
aVIt was fine and dandy, it allowed us to go down and find new species.
p149
aa(lp150
VThis picture was taken at 300 feet, catching new species of fish.
p151
aVThe problem was it didn't allow us much time.
p152
aVFor all its bulk and size, it only gave us about 15 minutes at most
p153
aVdown at those sorts of depths.
p154
aVWe needed more time. There had to be a better way.
p155
aVAnd indeed, there is a better way.
p156
aa(lp157
VIn 1994, I was fortunate enough to get access
p158
aVto these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers.
p159
aVClosed-circuit rebreather: what makes it different from scuba,
p160
aVand why is it better?
p161
aVWell, there are three main advantages to a rebreather.
p162
aVOne, they're quiet, they don't make any noise.
p163
aVTwo, they allow you to stay underwater longer.
p164
aVThree, they allow you to go deeper.
p165
aVHow is it that they do that?
p166
aVIn order to really understand how they do that,
p167
aVyou have to look underneath the hood and see what's going on.
p168
aa(lp169
VThere are three basic systems to a closed-circuit rebreather.
p170
aVThe most fundamental is called the breathing loop.
p171
aVIt's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it;
p172
aVit's a closed loop, and you breathe the same gas around and around.
p173
aVThere's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth,
p174
aVand there's a counter lung, or in this case, two counter lungs.
p175
aVThe counter lungs aren't high tech, they're simply flexible bags.
p176
aVThey allow you to mechanically breathe, mechanically ventilate.
p177
aVWhen you exhale, it goes in the exhale counter lung;
p178
aVwhen you inhale, it comes from the inhale counter lung.
p179
aVIt's just pure mechanics, allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop.
p180
aa(lp181
VThe other component on a breathing loop is the carbon-dioxide-absorbent canister.
p182
aVNow, as we breathe, we produce carbon dioxide,
p183
aVand that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system.
p184
aVThere's a chemical filter in there
p185
aVthat pulls the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas,
p186
aVso that when it comes back to us, it's safe to breathe again.
p187
aVThat's the breathing loop in a nutshell.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe second main component of a closed-circuit rebreather
p190
aVis the gas system.
p191
aVThe primary purpose of the gas system is to provide oxygen,
p192
aVto replenish the oxygen that your body consumes.
p193
aVSo the main tank, the main critical thing,
p194
aVis this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here.
p195
aVBut if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder,
p196
aVwe wouldn't be able to go very deep,
p197
aVbecause we'd run into oxygen toxicity very quickly.
p198
aVSo we need another gas, something to dilute the oxygen with.
p199
aVAnd that, fittingly enough, is called the diluent gas supply.
p200
aVIn our applications, we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply,
p201
aVbecause it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo that's where we get our nitrogen from.
p204
aVBut if we want to go deeper, of course, we need another gas supply,
p205
aVand helium is what we really need to go deep.
p206
aVUsually we'll have a slightly larger cylinder,
p207
aVmounted exterior on the rebreather, like this.
p208
aVThat's what we use to inject, as we start to do our deep dives.
p209
aVWe also have a second oxygen cylinder, solely as a backup;
p210
aVif there's a problem with our first oxygen supply,
p211
aVwe can continue to breathe.
p212
aVThe way you manage all these different gases and different gas supplies
p213
aVis this really high-tech, sophisticated gas block up on the front here,
p214
aVwhere it's easy to reach.
p215
aVIt's got the valves and knobs and things you need
p216
aVto inject the right gases at the right time.
p217
aa(lp218
VNormally, you don't have to do that,
p219
aVbecause all of it's done automatically
p220
aVwith the electronics, the third system of a rebreather.
p221
aVThe most critical part of a rebreather are the oxygen sensors.
p222
aVYou need three, so if one goes bad, you know which one it is.
p223
aVYou need voting logic.
p224
aVYou also have three microprocessors.
p225
aVAny one of those computers can run the entire system,
p226
aVso if you have to lose two of them,
p227
aVthere's back-up power supplies.
p228
aVAnd there are multiple displays, to get the information to the diver.
p229
aVThis is the high-tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do
p230
aVon these deep dives.
p231
aVI can talk about it all day \u2014 just ask my wife \u2014
p232
aVbut I want to move on to something much more interesting.
p233
aa(lp234
VI'm going to take you on a deep dive,
p235
aVand show you what it's like to do one.
p236
aVWe start up on the boat,
p237
aVFor all this high-tech, expensive equipment,
p238
aVthis is still the best way to get in the water,
p239
aVjust flop over the side of the boat.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, as I showed you in the earlier diagram,
p242
aVthese reefs that we dive on start out near the surface
p243
aVand they go almost vertically, completely straight down.
p244
aVSo we drop in the water and go over the edge of this cliff,
p245
aVand then we start dropping, dropping, dropping.
p246
aVPeople ask if it takes a long time to get there.
p247
aVNo; it only takes a couple minutes to get down to three or four hundred feet,
p248
aVwhich is what we're aiming for.
p249
aVIt's like skydiving in slow motion. It's really very interesting.
p250
aVYou ever see "The Abyss,"
p251
aVwhere Ed Harris is sinking down along the side of the wall?
p252
aVThat's what it feels like. Amazing.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd down there, you find that the water is very clear, extremely clear,
p255
aVbecause there's hardly any plankton.
p256
aVWhen you turn on your light and look around the caves,
p257
aVyou're confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity,
p258
aVmuch more than anyone used to believe.
p259
aVNow, not all of it is new species \u2014
p260
aVthat fish you see with the white stripe, that's a known species.
p261
aVBut if you look carefully into the cracks and crevices,
p262
aVyou'll see little things scurrying all over the place.
p263
aVThere's a just unbelievable diversity.
p264
aa(lp265
VIt's not just fish, either.
p266
aVThese are crinoids, sponges, black corals. There're some more fishes.
p267
aVThose fishes that you see now are new species.
p268
aVThey're still new species,
p269
aVbecause I had a video camera instead of my net,
p270
aVso they're still waiting down there for someone to go find them.
p271
aVBut this is what it looks like.
p272
aVAnd this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles.
p273
aVThis is Papua, New Guinea.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow little fishes and invertebrates aren't the only things we see down there.
p276
aVWe also see sharks,
p277
aVmuch more regularly than I would have expected to.
p278
aVWe're not quite sure why.
p279
aVWhat I want you to do now is imagine yourself 400 feet underwater,
p280
aVwith all this high-tech gear on your back,
p281
aVyou're in a remote reef off Papua, New Guinea,
p282
aVthousands of miles from the nearest recompression chamber,
p283
aVand you're completely surrounded by sharks.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Video) Diver 1: (In squeaky voice) Look at those ...
p286
aa(lp287
VDiver 2: Uh, oh ...
p288
aVUh, oh!
p289
aa(lp290
VAudience: (Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
V(Video) Diver 1: I think we have their attention ...
p293
aa(lp294
VRichard Pyle: When you start talking like Donald Duck,
p295
aVthere's no situation in the world that can seem tense.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VSo we're down there \u2014 this is at 400 feet.
p300
aVThat's looking straight up, by the way, to give a sense of how far the surface is.
p301
aVAnd if you're a biologist and know about sharks,
p302
aVand you want to assess, how much jeopardy am I really in here,
p303
aVthere's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately,
p304
aVwhich is \u2014
p305
aa(lp306
V(Video) Diver 1: What kind of sharks?
p307
aa(lp308
VDiver 2: Silvertip sharks.
p309
aa(lp310
VDiver 1: Oh.
p311
aa(lp312
VRP: There are actually three species of sharks here.
p313
aVThe silvertips are the ones with the white edges on the fins,
p314
aVand there're also gray reef sharks and hammerheads off in the distance.
p315
aVAnd yes, it's a little nerve-racking.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Video) Diver 2: Hoo!
p318
aVThat little guy is frisky!
p319
aa(lp320
VAudience: (Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VNow, you've seen video like this on TV a lot, and it's very intimidating.
p323
aVI think it gives the wrong impression about sharks;
p324
aVthey're actually not very dangerous animals.
p325
aVThat's why we weren't worried much and were joking around.
p326
aVMore people are killed by pigs, by lightning strikes,
p327
aVmore people are killed at soccer games in England.
p328
aVThere's a lot of other ways you can die.
p329
aVAnd I'm not making that stuff up.
p330
aVCoconuts! You can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark.
p331
aVSo sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be.
p332
aa(lp333
VNow, I don't know if any of you get US News and World Report \u2014
p334
aVI got the recent issue.
p335
aVThere's a cover story about the great explorers of our time.
p336
aVThe last article is entitled, "No New Frontiers."
p337
aVIt questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there,
p338
aVwhether there are any true, hardcore discoveries that can still be made.
p339
aVMy favorite line from the article:
p340
aV[... 'discovery' can mean finding a guppy with an extra spine in its dorsal fin."]
p341
aVI have to laugh; they don't call us fish nerds for nothing.
p342
aVWe actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy.
p343
aVBut it's much more than that.
p344
aVI want to show you a few of the guppies we've found over the years.
p345
aa(lp346
VThis one \u2014 you can see how ugly it is.
p347
aa(lp348
V(Laughter)
p349
aa(lp350
VEven if you ignore the scientific value of this thing,
p351
aVlook at the monetary value of this thing.
p352
aVA couple of these were sold through the aquarium trade to Japan,
p353
aVwhere they sold for 15,000 dollars apiece.
p354
aVThat's half a million dollars a pound.
p355
aa(lp356
VHere's another new angelfish we discovered.
p357
aVThis one we first discovered back in the air days \u2014 the bad old air days,
p358
aVwhen we were doing these kind of dives with air.
p359
aVWe were at 360 feet.
p360
aVI remember coming up from one of these deep dives and I had this fog,
p361
aVand the narcosis takes a little while to fade away, sort of like sobering up.
p362
aVI had this vague recollection of seeing this yellow fish with a black spot,
p363
aVand thought, "Damn, I should have caught one \u2014
p364
aVI think that's a new species."
p365
aVEventually, I looked in my bucket.
p366
aVSure enough, I had caught one, I just completely forgot.
p367
aVSo this one, we decided to give the name Centropyge narcosis to.
p368
aVThat's its official scientific name,
p369
aVin reference to its deep-dwelling habits.
p370
aa(lp371
VThis is another neat one.
p372
aVWhen we first found it,
p373
aVwe weren't even sure what family it belonged to,
p374
aVso we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish,
p375
aVsince it looked like something from one of those books.
p376
aa(lp377
VNow, this one's pretty cool.
p378
aVIf you go to Papua, New Guinea and go down 300 feet,
p379
aVyou'll see these big mounds.
p380
aVThis may be hard to see, but they're a couple meters in diameter.
p381
aVIf you look closely, you'll see there's a little white and gray fish
p382
aVthat hangs out near them.
p383
aVIt turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds,
p384
aVone pebble at a time.
p385
aVIt's extraordinary to find something like this.
p386
aVIt's not just new species, it's new behaviors, new ecology,
p387
aVall kind of new things.
p388
aa(lp389
VWhat I'm going to show you now, quickly,
p390
aVis a sampling of the new species we've discovered.
p391
aVWhat's extraordinary is not just the number of species we're finding \u2014
p392
aVthough as you can see, that's pretty amazing;
p393
aVthis is only half of what we've found \u2014
p394
aVwhat's extraordinary is how quickly we find them.
p395
aVWe're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth.
p396
aVIf you go to an Amazon jungle and fog a tree, you may get a lot of bugs,
p397
aVbut for fishes, there's nowhere in the world
p398
aVyou can get seven new species per hour of time.
p399
aa(lp400
VNow, we've done some back-of-the-envelope calculations,
p401
aVand we're predicting there are probably about 2,000 to 2,500 new species
p402
aVin the Indo-Pacific alone.
p403
aVThere are only five to six thousand known species,
p404
aVso a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known.
p405
aVWe thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity \u2014 evidently not.
p406
aa(lp407
VI'm going to just close on a very somber note.
p408
aVAt the beginning, I said I'd show you two extraordinary photographs.
p409
aVThis is the second extraordinary photograph I'm going to show you.
p410
aVThis one was taken at the exact moment I was down there filming those sharks.
p411
aVThis was taken exactly 300 feet above my head.
p412
aVThe reason this photograph is extraordinary
p413
aVis because it captures a moment
p414
aVin the very last minute of a person's life.
p415
aVLess than 60 seconds after this picture was taken, this guy was dead.
p416
aVWhen we recovered his body, we figured out what had gone wrong.
p417
aVHe had made a very simple mistake;
p418
aVhe turned the wrong valve when he filled his cylinder.
p419
aVhe had 80 percent oxygen in his tank when he should have had 40.
p420
aVHe had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned.
p421
aa(lp422
VThe reason I show this \u2014 not to put a downer on everything \u2014
p423
aVbut I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general,
p424
aVwhich is that we all have two goals.
p425
aVThe first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet,
p426
aVwhich is to survive.
p427
aVI call it perpetuation: the survival of the species and survival of ourselves,
p428
aVAnd those are both about perpetuating the genome.
p429
aa(lp430
VThe second goal, for those of us who have mastered the first goal \u2014
p431
aVcall it spiritual fulfillment, call it financial success,
p432
aVyou can call it any number of different things.
p433
aVI call it seeking joy, this pursuit of happiness.
p434
aVSo, I guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest,
p435
aVhe absolutely did.
p436
aVYou have to balance those two goals.
p437
aVIf you live your whole life in fear \u2014
p438
aVI mean, life is a sexually transmitted disease with 100 percent mortality.
p439
aVSo you can't live your life in fear.
p440
aa(lp441
V(Laughter)
p442
aa(lp443
VI thought that was an old one!
p444
aa(lp445
V(Applause)
p446
aa(lp447
VBut at the same time, you don't want to get so focused on rule number two,
p448
aVgoal number two,
p449
aVthat you neglect goal number one.
p450
aVBecause once you're dead, you really can't enjoy anything after that.
p451
aVSo I wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance
p452
aVin your future endeavors.
p453
aa(lp454
VThanks.

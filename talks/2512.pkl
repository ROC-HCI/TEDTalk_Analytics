VWhat do you see?
p5
aVMost of you see a barbershop,
p6
aVbut I see an opportunity:
p7
aVan opportunity for health,
p8
aVan opportunity for health equity.
p9
aa(lp10
VFor black men, the barbershop is not just a place
p11
aVwhere you get your hair cut or your beard trimmed.
p12
aVNo, it's much more than that.
p13
aVHistorically, the barbershop has been a safe haven for black men.
p14
aVIt's a place where we go for friendship,
p15
aVsolidarity and solace.
p16
aVIt's a place where we go to get away from the stress
p17
aVof the grind of work
p18
aVand sometimes home life.
p19
aVIt's a place where we don't have to worry
p20
aVabout how we're being perceived by the outside world.
p21
aVIt's a place where we don't feel threatened,
p22
aVor threatening.
p23
aVIt's a place of loyalty and trust.
p24
aVFor that reason,
p25
aVit's one of the few places where we can fearlessly be ourselves
p26
aVand just ... talk.
p27
aVThe talk, the shop talk, the conversation,
p28
aVthat is the essence of the black barbershop.
p29
aa(lp30
VI can remember going to the barbershop with my dad as a kid.
p31
aVWe went to Mr. Mike's barbershop every other Saturday.
p32
aVAnd like clockwork, the same group of men would be there
p33
aVevery time we went,
p34
aVeither waiting on their favorite barber
p35
aVor just soaking up the atmosphere.
p36
aa(lp37
VI can remember the jovial greeting that warmly welcomed us
p38
aVevery time we went.
p39
aa(lp40
V"Hey Rev," they would say to my dad.
p41
aVHe's a local pastor, and they treated him like a celebrity.
p42
aa(lp43
V"Hey young fella, how you doing?"
p44
aVthey would say to me,
p45
aVmaking me feel just as special.
p46
aa(lp47
VI remember the range of the conversations was immense.
p48
aVThe men would talk about politics and sports and music
p49
aVand world news, national news,
p50
aVneighborhood news.
p51
aVThere was some talk about women
p52
aVand what it was like to be a black man in America.
p53
aVBut many times they also talked about health.
p54
aVThe conversations about health were lengthy and deep.
p55
aVThe men often recounted their doctor's recommendations
p56
aVto cut salt in their diet
p57
aVor to eat less fried foods
p58
aVor to stop smoking
p59
aVor to reduce stress.
p60
aVThey talked about the different ways you could reduce stress,
p61
aVlike simplifying one's love life \u2014
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
Vall ways to treat high blood pressure.
p66
aa(lp67
VThere's a lot of talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop.
p68
aVThat's because almost 40 percent of black men have it.
p69
aVThat means that almost every single black man
p70
aVeither has high blood pressure
p71
aVor knows a black man who has it.
p72
aa(lp73
VSometimes, those conversations in the barbershop
p74
aVwould be about what happens when high blood pressure
p75
aVis not adequately addressed.
p76
aa(lp77
V"Say, did you hear about Jimmy? He had a stroke."
p78
aa(lp79
V"Did you hear about Eddie? He died last week.
p80
aVMassive heart attack.
p81
aVHe was 50."
p82
aa(lp83
VMore black men die from high blood pressure than from anything else,
p84
aVeven though decades of medical wisdom and science have demonstrated
p85
aVthat death from high blood pressure can be prevented
p86
aVwith timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men?
p89
aVBecause too often, high blood pressure is either untreated
p90
aVor under-treated in black men,
p91
aVin part because of our lower engagement with the primary healthcare system.
p92
aVBlack men, in particular those with high blood pressure,
p93
aVare less likely to have a primary care doctor
p94
aVthan other groups.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut why?
p97
aVSome of our earliest research on black men's health
p98
aVrevealed that for many, the doctor's office is associated with fear,
p99
aVmistrust,
p100
aVdisrespect,
p101
aVand unnecessary unpleasantness.
p102
aVThe doctor's office is only a place that you go when you don't feel well.
p103
aVAnd when you do go, you might wait for hours
p104
aVonly to get the run-around
p105
aVand to be evaluated by a stoic figure in a white coat
p106
aVwho only has 10 minutes to give you
p107
aVand who doesn't value the talk.
p108
aVSo it's no wonder that some men don't want to be bothered
p109
aVand skip going to the doctor altogether,
p110
aVespecially if they feel fine.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut herein lies the problem.
p113
aVYou can feel just fine
p114
aVwhile high blood pressure ravages your most vital organs.
p115
aa(lp116
VThis is Denny Moe,
p117
aVowner of Denny Moe's Superstar Barbershop in Harlem.
p118
aVI've been lucky enough to have Denny as my barber for the last eight years.
p119
aa(lp120
VHe said to me once,
p121
aV"Hey Doc, you know,
p122
aVlots of black men trust their barbers more than they trust their doctors."
p123
aa(lp124
VThis was stunning to me,
p125
aVat first,
p126
aVbut not so much when you think about it.
p127
aVBlack men have been with their current barbers
p128
aVon average as long as I've been with Denny,
p129
aVabout eight years.
p130
aVAnd black men see their barbers about every two weeks.
p131
aVNot only do you trust your barber with your look and with your style,
p132
aVbut you also trust him with your secrets and sometimes your life.
p133
aVDenny, like many barbers, is more than just an artist,
p134
aVa businessman and confidant.
p135
aVHe's a leader and a passionate advocate for the well-being of his community.
p136
aVThe very first time I walked into Denny Moe's shop,
p137
aVhe wasn't just cutting hair.
p138
aVHe was also orchestrating a voter registration drive
p139
aVto give a voice to his customers and his community.
p140
aa(lp141
VWith this kind of activism,
p142
aVand community investment that typifies the black barbershop,
p143
aVof course the barbershop is a perfect place
p144
aVto talk about high blood pressure and other health concerns in the community.
p145
aa(lp146
VFirst, the barbershop is not a medical setting,
p147
aVand so it doesn't have all the negative psychological baggage
p148
aVthat comes along with that.
p149
aVWhen you're in a barbershop,
p150
aVyou're in your territory, and you're among friends
p151
aVwho share your history,
p152
aVyour struggle and your health risks.
p153
aa(lp154
VSecond, because the barbershop is a place of connection,
p155
aVloyalty and trust,
p156
aVit's a place where you're more open to have a conversation about health
p157
aVand especially about high blood pressure.
p158
aVAfter all,
p159
aVconversations about high blood pressure have all the elements of great shop talk:
p160
aVstress and high blood pressure,
p161
aVfood and high blood pressure,
p162
aVrelationships and high blood pressure,
p163
aVand yes, what it's like to be a black man in America
p164
aVand high blood pressure.
p165
aa(lp166
VBut you can do more than just talk about high blood pressure
p167
aVin the barbershop.
p168
aVYou can concretely take action.
p169
aVHere we have an opportunity to partner with the Denny Moe's of the world
p170
aVand empower communities to address the health inequities
p171
aVthat uniquely affect it.
p172
aVWhen high blood pressure screening expanded from clinics and hospitals
p173
aVto communities in the 1960s and '70s,
p174
aVblack physicians like Dr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore
p175
aVand Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans
p176
aVwere at the forefront of bringing health promotion to community hubs
p177
aVin urban black neighborhoods.
p178
aa(lp179
VThese pioneers paved the way for my professional journey
p180
aVwith barbershops and health,
p181
aVwhich began in Chicago in medical school.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe very first research project that I worked on as a medical student
p184
aVwas to help design healthcare interventions
p185
aVthat would appeal to black men.
p186
aVWe conducted about a dozen focus groups
p187
aVwith a broad cross-section of black men,
p188
aVand we learned that for them,
p189
aVbeing healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy
p190
aVas it was about feeling healthy,
p191
aVand that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good.
p192
aVThis work led to the development of Project Brotherhood,
p193
aVa community clinic founded by Dr. Eric Whitaker
p194
aVthat provided tailored healthcare to black men.
p195
aVPart of this tailored care
p196
aVinvolved having a barber on the premises
p197
aVto reward the men who came for needed healthcare
p198
aVwith a free haircut,
p199
aVto let the men know that we, too, valued how they looked
p200
aVas well as how they felt,
p201
aVand that what was important to them was also important to us.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut while there's only one Project Brotherhood,
p204
aVthere are thousands of black barbershops
p205
aVwhere the intersection of health and haircuts can be cultivated.
p206
aVThe next stop on my journey was Dallas, Texas,
p207
aVwhere we learned that barbers were not only willing
p208
aVbut fully able to roll up their sleeves and participate
p209
aVin delivering needed health services to improve the health of their customers
p210
aVand their community.
p211
aVWe teamed up with an amazing cadre of black barbers
p212
aVand taught them how to measure blood pressure
p213
aVand how to counsel their customers
p214
aVand refer them to doctors
p215
aVto help manage high blood pressure.
p216
aVThe barbers were not only willing to do it
p217
aVbut they were damn good at it.
p218
aVOver a three-year period,
p219
aVthe barbers measured thousands of blood pressures
p220
aVresulting in hundreds of black men being referred to doctors
p221
aVfor medical care of their high blood pressure.
p222
aVThese barber-doctor partnerships
p223
aVresulted in a 20 percent increase in the number of men
p224
aVwho were able to achieve target blood pressure levels
p225
aVand a three-point drop, on average,
p226
aVin the blood pressure of each participant.
p227
aVIf we were to extrapolate that three point drop
p228
aVto every single black man with high blood pressure in America,
p229
aVwe would prevent 800 heart attacks, 500 strokes and 900 deaths
p230
aVfrom high blood pressure
p231
aVin just one year.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd our experience with barbershops has been no different in New York City,
p234
aVwhere my journey has currently led me.
p235
aVWith an incredible team of diverse research assistants,
p236
aVcommunity health workers and volunteers,
p237
aVwe've been able to partner with over 200 barbershops
p238
aVand other trusted community venues
p239
aVto reach over 7,000 older black men.
p240
aVAnd we've offered high blood pressure screening and counseling
p241
aVto each and every one of them.
p242
aVThanks to Denny Moe
p243
aVand the myriad other barbers and community leaders
p244
aVwho shared the vision of opportunity and empowerment
p245
aVto make a difference in their communities,
p246
aVwe've been able to not only lower blood pressure
p247
aVin our participants,
p248
aVbut we've also been able to impact other health indicators.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo what do you see?
p251
aVWhat is your barbershop?
p252
aVWhere is that place for you
p253
aVwhere people who are affected by a unique problem
p254
aVcan meet a unique solution?
p255
aVWhen you find that place, see the opportunity.
p256
aa(lp257
VThank you.

VSo let me just start with my story.
p5
aVSo I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage
p6
aVplaying soccer in college.
p7
aVThen I went on to tear my ACL, the ligament in my knee,
p8
aVand then developed an arthritic knee.
p9
aVAnd I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story,
p10
aVand, by the way, I married a woman
p11
aVwho has exactly the same story.
p12
aVSo this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon
p13
aVand to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems
p14
aVthat would keep me playing sports and not limit me.
p15
aVSo with that, let me just show you a quick video
p16
aVto get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain.
p17
aa(lp18
VNarrator: We are all aware of the risk of cancer,
p19
aVbut there's another disease
p20
aVthat's destined to affect even more of us: arthritis.
p21
aVCancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers,
p22
aVarthritis ruins more lives.
p23
aVAssuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance
p24
aVyou'll develop arthritis.
p25
aVAnd it's not just aging that causes arthritis.
p26
aVCommon injuries can lead to decades of pain,
p27
aVuntil our joints quite literally grind to a halt.
p28
aVDesperate for a solution, we've turned to engineering
p29
aVto design artificial components
p30
aVto replace our worn-out body parts,
p31
aVbut in the midst of the modern buzz
p32
aVaround the promises of a bionic body,
p33
aVshouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way?
p34
aVLet's consider an alternative path.
p35
aVWhat if all the replacements our bodies need
p36
aValready exist in nature,
p37
aVor within our own stem cells?
p38
aVThis is the field of biologic replacements,
p39
aVwhere we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones.
p40
aa(lp41
VKevin Stone: And so, the mission is:
p42
aVhow do I treat these things biologically?
p43
aVAnd let's talk about both what I did for my wife,
p44
aVand what I've done for hundreds of other patients.
p45
aVFirst thing for my wife,
p46
aVand the most common thing I hear from my patients,
p47
aVparticularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group,
p48
aVis they come in and say,
p49
aV"Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee?
p50
aVI'm not ready for joint replacement."
p51
aVAnd so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor
p52
aVright into that [knee] joint space.
p53
aVAnd [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus].
p54
aVAnd then for that unstable ligament,
p55
aVwe put in a human donor ligament
p56
aVto stabilize the knee.
p57
aVAnd then for the damaged arthritis on the surface,
p58
aVwe did a stem cell paste graft,
p59
aVwhich we designed in 1991,
p60
aVto regrow that articular cartilage surface
p61
aVand give it back a smooth surface there.
p62
aVSo here's my wife's bad knee on the left,
p63
aVand her just hiking now
p64
aVfour months later in Aspen, and doing well.
p65
aVAnd it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients.
p66
aVThe girl on the video, Jen Hudak,
p67
aVjust won the Superpipe in Aspen
p68
aVjust nine months after having destroyed her knee,
p69
aVas you see in the other image \u2014
p70
aVand having a paste graft to that knee.
p71
aVAnd so we can regrow these surfaces biologically.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo with all this success,
p74
aVwhy isn't that good enough, you might ask.
p75
aVWell the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles.
p76
aVThere's not enough young, healthy people
p77
aVfalling off their motorcycle
p78
aVand donating that tissue to us.
p79
aVAnd the tissue's very expensive.
p80
aVAnd so that's not going to be a solution
p81
aVthat's going to get us global with biologic tissue.
p82
aVBut the solution is animal tissue
p83
aVbecause it's plentiful, it's cheap,
p84
aVyou can get it from young, healthy tissues,
p85
aVbut the barrier is immunology.
p86
aVAnd the specific barrier
p87
aVis a specific epitope
p88
aVcalled the galactosyl, or gal epitope.
p89
aVSo if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people,
p90
aVwe have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo my story in working with animal tissues
p93
aVstarts in 1984.
p94
aVAnd I started first
p95
aVwith cow Achilles tendon,
p96
aVwhere we would take the cow Achilles tendon,
p97
aVwhich is type-I collagen,
p98
aVstrip it of its antigens
p99
aVby degrading it with an acid and detergent wash
p100
aVand forming it into a regeneration template.
p101
aVWe would then take that regeneration template
p102
aVand insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage
p103
aVto regrow that in a patient's knee.
p104
aVWe've now done that procedure,
p105
aVand it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases,
p106
aVso it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way
p107
aVto regrow the meniscus.
p108
aVAnd that's great when I can degrade the tissue.
p109
aVBut what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament?
p110
aVI can't grind it up in a blender.
p111
aVSo in that case,
p112
aVI have to design \u2014 and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek \u2014
p113
aVan enzyme wash
p114
aVto wash away, or strip,
p115
aVthose galactosyl epitopes
p116
aVwith a specific enzyme.
p117
aVAnd we call that a "gal stripping" technique.
p118
aVWhat we do is humanize the tissue.
p119
aVIt's by gal stripping that tissue
p120
aVwe humanize it (Laughter),
p121
aVand then we can put it back
p122
aVinto a patient's knee.
p123
aVAnd we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament \u2014
p124
aVyoung, healthy, big tissue,
p125
aVput it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial \u2014
p126
aVand then one of our patients went on to have
p127
aVthree Canadian Masters Downhill championships \u2014
p128
aVon his "pig-lig," as he calls it. So we know it can work.
p129
aVAnd there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo what about the next step?
p132
aVWhat about getting to a total biologic knee replacement,
p133
aVnot just the parts?
p134
aVHow are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement?
p135
aVWell here's how we're going to do it.
p136
aVSo what we're going to do is take
p137
aVan articular cartilage
p138
aVfrom a young, healthy pig,
p139
aVstrip it of its antigens,
p140
aVload it with your stem cells,
p141
aVthen put it back on to that
p142
aVarthritic surface in your knee,
p143
aVtack it on there, have you heal that surface
p144
aVand then create a new biologic surface for your knee.
p145
aVSo that's our biologic approach right now.
p146
aVWe're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.
p147
aVWe're going to resurface it with a completely new surface.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut we have other advantages from the animal kingdom.
p150
aVThere's a benefit of 400 million years
p151
aVof ambulation.
p152
aVWe can harness those benefits.
p153
aVWe can use thicker, younger, better tissues
p154
aVthan you might have injured in your knee,
p155
aVor that you might have when you're 40, 50 or 60.
p156
aVWe can do it as an outpatient procedure.
p157
aVWe can strip that tissue very economically,
p158
aVand so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement
p159
aVto go global.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd so welcome to super biologics.
p162
aVIt's not hardware.
p163
aVIt's not software.
p164
aVIt's bioware.
p165
aVIt's version 2.0 of you.
p166
aVAnd so with that, coming to a \u2014
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aVcoming to an operating theater near you soon, I believe.
p169
aa(lp170
VThank you very much.

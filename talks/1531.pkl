VLike many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.
p5
aVI was born to a family where education was pervasive.
p6
aVI'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.
p7
aVIn my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.
p8
aVSo it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities,
p9
aVwhich in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.
p10
aa(lp11
VUnfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.
p12
aVIn some parts of the world, for example, South Africa,
p13
aVeducation is just not readily accessible.
p14
aVIn South Africa, the educational system was constructed
p15
aVin the days of apartheid for the white minority.
p16
aVAnd as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots
p17
aVfor the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.
p18
aVThat scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year
p19
aVat the University of Johannesburg.
p20
aVThere were a handful of positions left open
p21
aVfrom the standard admissions process, and the night before
p22
aVthey were supposed to open that for registration,
p23
aVthousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long,
p24
aVhoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.
p25
aVWhen the gates opened, there was a stampede,
p26
aVand 20 people were injured and one woman died.
p27
aVShe was a mother who gave her life
p28
aVtrying to get her son a chance at a better life.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut even in parts of the world like the United States
p31
aVwhere education is available, it might not be within reach.
p32
aVThere has been much discussed in the last few years
p33
aVabout the rising cost of health care.
p34
aVWhat might not be quite as obvious to people
p35
aVis that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition
p36
aVhas been increasing at almost twice the rate,
p37
aVfor a total of 559 percent since 1985.
p38
aVThis makes education unaffordable for many people.
p39
aa(lp40
VFinally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education,
p41
aVthe doors of opportunity might not open.
p42
aVOnly a little over half of recent college graduates
p43
aVin the United States who get a higher education
p44
aVactually are working in jobs that require that education.
p45
aVThis, of course, is not true for the students
p46
aVwho graduate from the top institutions,
p47
aVbut for many others, they do not get the value
p48
aVfor their time and their effort.
p49
aa(lp50
VTom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article,
p51
aVcaptured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.
p52
aVHe said the big breakthroughs are what happen
p53
aVwhen what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.
p54
aVI've talked about what's desperately necessary.
p55
aVLet's talk about what's suddenly possible.
p56
aa(lp57
VWhat's suddenly possible was demonstrated by
p58
aVthree big Stanford classes,
p59
aVeach of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.
p60
aVSo to understand this, let's look at one of those classes,
p61
aVthe Machine Learning class offered by my colleague
p62
aVand cofounder Andrew Ng.
p63
aVAndrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.
p64
aVIt's a Machine Learning class,
p65
aVand it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.
p66
aVWhen Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public,
p67
aVit had 100,000 people registered.
p68
aVSo to put that number in perspective,
p69
aVfor Andrew to reach that same size audience
p70
aVby teaching a Stanford class,
p71
aVhe would have to do that for 250 years.
p72
aVOf course, he'd get really bored.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo, having seen the impact of this,
p75
aVAndrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up,
p76
aVto bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.
p77
aVSo we formed Coursera,
p78
aVwhose goal is to take the best courses
p79
aVfrom the best instructors at the best universities
p80
aVand provide it to everyone around the world for free.
p81
aVWe currently have 43 courses on the platform
p82
aVfrom four universities across a range of disciplines,
p83
aVand let me show you a little bit of an overview
p84
aVof what that looks like.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Video) Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.
p87
aa(lp88
VEzekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.
p89
aa(lp90
VScott Page: Models help us design more effective institutions and policies.
p91
aVWe get unbelievable segregation.
p92
aa(lp93
VScott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future,
p94
aVyou'd wear a camera right in the center of your head.
p95
aa(lp96
VMitchell Duneier: Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...
p97
aa(lp98
VRG: Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine.
p99
aa(lp100
VNick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.
p101
aa(lp102
VPaul Offit: ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus.
p103
aa(lp104
VDan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny.
p105
aa(lp106
VDaphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.
p107
aa(lp108
VAndrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...
p109
aa(lp110
V(Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
VDK: It turns out, maybe not surprisingly,
p113
aVthat students like getting the best content
p114
aVfrom the best universities for free.
p115
aVSince we opened the website in February,
p116
aVwe now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.
p117
aVWe have 1.5 million enrollments,
p118
aV6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched
p119
aVso far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.
p120
aa(lp121
VBut it's not just about the numbers,
p122
aVit's also about the people.
p123
aVWhether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India
p124
aVand would never have access in this case
p125
aVto a Stanford-quality course
p126
aVand would never be able to afford it.
p127
aVOr Jenny, who is a single mother of two
p128
aVand wants to hone her skills
p129
aVso that she can go back and complete her master's degree.
p130
aVOr Ryan, who can't go to school,
p131
aVbecause his immune deficient daughter
p132
aVcan't be risked to have germs come into the house,
p133
aVso he couldn't leave the house.
p134
aVI'm really glad to say \u2014
p135
aVrecently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan \u2014
p136
aVthat this story had a happy ending.
p137
aVBaby Shannon \u2014 you can see her on the left \u2014
p138
aVis doing much better now,
p139
aVand Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo what made these courses so different?
p142
aVAfter all, online course content has been available for a while.
p143
aVWhat made it different was that this was real course experience.
p144
aVIt started on a given day,
p145
aVand then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis
p146
aVand do homework assignments.
p147
aVAnd these would be real homework assignments
p148
aVfor a real grade, with a real deadline.
p149
aVYou can see the deadlines and the usage graph.
p150
aVThese are the spikes showing
p151
aVthat procrastination is global phenomenon.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VAt the end of the course,
p156
aVthe students got a certificate.
p157
aVThey could present that certificate
p158
aVto a prospective employer and get a better job,
p159
aVand we know many students who did.
p160
aVSome students took their certificate
p161
aVand presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled
p162
aVfor actual college credit.
p163
aVSo these students were really getting something meaningful
p164
aVfor their investment of time and effort.
p165
aa(lp166
VLet's talk a little bit about some of the components
p167
aVthat go into these courses.
p168
aVThe first component is that when you move away
p169
aVfrom the constraints of a physical classroom
p170
aVand design content explicitly for an online format,
p171
aVyou can break away from, for example,
p172
aVthe monolithic one-hour lecture.
p173
aVYou can break up the material, for example,
p174
aVinto these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes,
p175
aVeach of which represents a coherent concept.
p176
aVStudents can traverse this material in different ways,
p177
aVdepending on their background, their skills or their interests.
p178
aVSo, for example, some students might benefit
p179
aVfrom a little bit of preparatory material
p180
aVthat other students might already have.
p181
aVOther students might be interested in a particular
p182
aVenrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.
p183
aVSo this format allows us to break away
p184
aVfrom the one-size-fits-all model of education,
p185
aVand allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.
p186
aa(lp187
VOf course, we all know as educators
p188
aVthat students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.
p189
aVPerhaps one of the biggest components of this effort
p190
aVis that we need to have students
p191
aVwho practice with the material
p192
aVin order to really understand it.
p193
aVThere's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.
p194
aVThis one that appeared in Science last year, for example,
p195
aVdemonstrates that even simple retrieval practice,
p196
aVwhere students are just supposed to repeat
p197
aVwhat they already learned
p198
aVgives considerably improved results
p199
aVon various achievement tests down the line
p200
aVthan many other educational interventions.
p201
aa(lp202
VWe've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform,
p203
aVas well as other forms of practice in many ways.
p204
aVFor example, even our videos are not just videos.
p205
aVEvery few minutes, the video pauses
p206
aVand the students get asked a question.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Video) SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting,
p209
aVstatus quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.
p210
aVSo they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.
p211
aa(lp212
VDK: So here the video pauses,
p213
aVand the student types in the answer into the box
p214
aVand submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VSo they get to try again,
p219
aVand this time they got it right.
p220
aVThere's an optional explanation if they want.
p221
aVAnd now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.
p222
aVThis is a kind of simple question
p223
aVthat I as an instructor might ask in class,
p224
aVbut when I ask that kind of a question in class,
p225
aV80 percent of the students
p226
aVare still scribbling the last thing I said,
p227
aV15 percent are zoned out on Facebook,
p228
aVand then there's the smarty pants in the front row
p229
aVwho blurts out the answer
p230
aVbefore anyone else has had a chance to think about it,
p231
aVand I as the instructor am terribly gratified
p232
aVthat somebody actually knew the answer.
p233
aVAnd so the lecture moves on before, really,
p234
aVmost of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.
p235
aVHere, every single student
p236
aVhas to engage with the material.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd of course these simple retrieval questions
p239
aVare not the end of the story.
p240
aVOne needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions,
p241
aVand one also needs to provide the students with feedback
p242
aVon those questions.
p243
aVNow, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students
p244
aVif you do not have 10,000 TAs?
p245
aVThe answer is, you need to use technology
p246
aVto do it for you.
p247
aVNow, fortunately, technology has come a long way,
p248
aVand we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.
p249
aVIn addition to multiple choice
p250
aVand the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video,
p251
aVwe can also grade math, mathematical expressions
p252
aVas well as mathematical derivations.
p253
aVWe can grade models, whether it's
p254
aVfinancial models in a business class
p255
aVor physical models in a science or engineering class
p256
aVand we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.
p257
aa(lp258
VLet me show you one that's actually pretty simple
p259
aVbut fairly visual.
p260
aVThis is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class,
p261
aVand the students are supposed to color-correct
p262
aVthat blurry red image.
p263
aVThey're typing their program into the browser,
p264
aVand you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.
p265
aVAnd so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that,
p266
aVand they can move on to the next assignment.
p267
aVThis ability to interact actively with the material
p268
aVand be told when you're right or wrong
p269
aVis really essential to student learning.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow, of course we cannot yet grade
p272
aVthe range of work that one needs for all courses.
p273
aVSpecifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work
p274
aVthat is so essential in such disciplines
p275
aVas the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.
p276
aVSo we tried to convince, for example,
p277
aVsome of our humanities faculty
p278
aVthat multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.
p279
aVThat didn't go over really well.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo we had to come up with a different solution.
p282
aVAnd the solution we ended up using is peer grading.
p283
aVIt turns out that previous studies show,
p284
aVlike this one by Saddler and Good,
p285
aVthat peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy
p286
aVfor providing reproducible grades.
p287
aVIt was tried only in small classes,
p288
aVbut there it showed, for example,
p289
aVthat these student-assigned grades on the y-axis
p290
aVare actually very well correlated
p291
aVwith the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.
p292
aVWhat's even more surprising is that self-grades,
p293
aVwhere the students grade their own work critically \u2014
p294
aVso long as you incentivize them properly
p295
aVso they can't give themselves a perfect score \u2014
p296
aVare actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.
p297
aVAnd so this is an effective strategy
p298
aVthat can be used for grading at scale,
p299
aVand is also a useful learning strategy for the students,
p300
aVbecause they actually learn from the experience.
p301
aVSo we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised,
p302
aVwhere tens of thousands of students
p303
aVare grading each other's work,
p304
aVand quite successfully, I have to say.
p305
aa(lp306
VBut this is not just about students
p307
aVsitting alone in their living room working through problems.
p308
aVAround each one of our courses,
p309
aVa community of students had formed,
p310
aVa global community of people
p311
aVaround a shared intellectual endeavor.
p312
aVWhat you see here is a self-generated map
p313
aVfrom students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course,
p314
aVwhere they have put themselves on a world map,
p315
aVand you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.
p316
aa(lp317
VStudents collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.
p318
aVFirst of all, there was a question and answer forum,
p319
aVwhere students would pose questions,
p320
aVand other students would answer those questions.
p321
aVAnd the really amazing thing is,
p322
aVbecause there were so many students,
p323
aVit means that even if a student posed a question
p324
aVat 3 o'clock in the morning,
p325
aVsomewhere around the world,
p326
aVthere would be somebody who was awake
p327
aVand working on the same problem.
p328
aVAnd so, in many of our courses,
p329
aVthe median response time for a question
p330
aVon the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.
p331
aVWhich is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd you can see from the student testimonials
p336
aVthat students actually find
p337
aVthat because of this large online community,
p338
aVthey got to interact with each other in many ways
p339
aVthat were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.
p340
aVStudents also self-assembled,
p341
aVwithout any kind of intervention from us,
p342
aVinto small study groups.
p343
aVSome of these were physical study groups
p344
aValong geographical constraints
p345
aVand met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.
p346
aVThis is the San Francisco study group,
p347
aVbut there were ones all over the world.
p348
aVOthers were virtual study groups,
p349
aVsometimes along language lines or along cultural lines,
p350
aVand on the bottom left there,
p351
aVyou see our multicultural universal study group
p352
aVwhere people explicitly wanted to connect
p353
aVwith people from other cultures.
p354
aa(lp355
VThere are some tremendous opportunities
p356
aVto be had from this kind of framework.
p357
aVThe first is that it has the potential of giving us
p358
aVa completely unprecedented look
p359
aVinto understanding human learning.
p360
aVBecause the data that we can collect here is unique.
p361
aVYou can collect every click, every homework submission,
p362
aVevery forum post from tens of thousands of students.
p363
aVSo you can turn the study of human learning
p364
aVfrom the hypothesis-driven mode
p365
aVto the data-driven mode, a transformation that,
p366
aVfor example, has revolutionized biology.
p367
aVYou can use these data to understand fundamental questions
p368
aVlike, what are good learning strategies
p369
aVthat are effective versus ones that are not?
p370
aVAnd in the context of particular courses,
p371
aVyou can ask questions
p372
aVlike, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common
p373
aVand how do we help students fix them?
p374
aa(lp375
VSo here's an example of that,
p376
aValso from Andrew's Machine Learning class.
p377
aVThis is a distribution of wrong answers
p378
aVto one of Andrew's assignments.
p379
aVThe answers happen to be pairs of numbers,
p380
aVso you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.
p381
aVEach of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.
p382
aVThe big cross at the top left
p383
aVis where 2,000 students
p384
aVgave the exact same wrong answer.
p385
aVNow, if two students in a class of 100
p386
aVgive the same wrong answer,
p387
aVyou would never notice.
p388
aVBut when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer,
p389
aVit's kind of hard to miss.
p390
aVSo Andrew and his students went in,
p391
aVlooked at some of those assignments,
p392
aVunderstood the root cause of the misconception,
p393
aVand then they produced a targeted error message
p394
aVthat would be provided to every student
p395
aVwhose answer fell into that bucket,
p396
aVwhich means that students who made that same mistake
p397
aVwould now get personalized feedback
p398
aVtelling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo this personalization is something that one can then build
p401
aVby having the virtue of large numbers.
p402
aVPersonalization is perhaps
p403
aVone of the biggest opportunities here as well,
p404
aVbecause it provides us with the potential
p405
aVof solving a 30-year-old problem.
p406
aVEducational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984,
p407
aVposed what's called the 2 sigma problem,
p408
aVwhich he observed by studying three populations.
p409
aVThe first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.
p410
aVThe second is a population of students that studied
p411
aVusing a standard lecture-based classroom,
p412
aVbut with a mastery-based approach,
p413
aVso the students couldn't move on to the next topic
p414
aVbefore demonstrating mastery of the previous one.
p415
aVAnd finally, there was a population of students
p416
aVthat were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.
p417
aVThe mastery-based population was a full standard deviation,
p418
aVor sigma, in achievement scores better
p419
aVthan the standard lecture-based class,
p420
aVand the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma
p421
aVimprovement in performance.
p422
aa(lp423
VTo understand what that means,
p424
aVlet's look at the lecture-based classroom,
p425
aVand let's pick the median performance as a threshold.
p426
aVSo in a lecture-based class,
p427
aVhalf the students are above that level and half are below.
p428
aVIn the individual tutoring instruction,
p429
aV98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.
p430
aVImagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students
p431
aVwould be above average.
p432
aVHence, the 2 sigma problem.
p433
aa(lp434
VBecause we cannot afford, as a society,
p435
aVto provide every student with an individual human tutor.
p436
aVBut maybe we can afford to provide each student
p437
aVwith a computer or a smartphone.
p438
aVSo the question is, how can we use technology
p439
aVto push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve,
p440
aVto the right side with the green curve?
p441
aVMastery is easy to achieve using a computer,
p442
aVbecause a computer doesn't get tired
p443
aVof showing you the same video five times.
p444
aVAnd it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times,
p445
aVwe've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.
p446
aVAnd even personalization
p447
aVis something that we're starting to see the beginnings of,
p448
aVwhether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum
p449
aVor some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.
p450
aVSo the goal here is to try and push,
p451
aVand see how far we can get towards the green curve.
p452
aa(lp453
VSo, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?
p454
aVWell, Mark Twain certainly thought so.
p455
aVHe said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes
p456
aVgo straight to the students' lecture notes,
p457
aVwithout passing through the brains of either."
p458
aa(lp459
V(Laughter)
p460
aa(lp461
VI beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.
p462
aVI think what he was complaining about is not
p463
aVuniversities but rather the lecture-based format
p464
aVthat so many universities spend so much time on.
p465
aVSo let's go back even further, to Plutarch,
p466
aVwho said that, "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling,
p467
aVbut wood that needs igniting."
p468
aVAnd maybe we should spend less time at universities
p469
aVfilling our students' minds with content
p470
aVby lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity,
p471
aVtheir imagination and their problem-solving skills
p472
aVby actually talking with them.
p473
aa(lp474
VSo how do we do that?
p475
aVWe do that by doing active learning in the classroom.
p476
aVSo there's been many studies, including this one,
p477
aVthat show that if you use active learning,
p478
aVinteracting with your students in the classroom,
p479
aVperformance improves on every single metric \u2014
p480
aVon attendance, on engagement and on learning
p481
aVas measured by a standardized test.
p482
aVYou can see, for example, that the achievement score
p483
aValmost doubles in this particular experiment.
p484
aVSo maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.
p485
aa(lp486
VSo to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education
p487
aVto everyone around the world for free,
p488
aVwhat would that do? Three things.
p489
aVFirst it would establish education as a fundamental human right,
p490
aVwhere anyone around the world
p491
aVwith the ability and the motivation
p492
aVcould get the skills that they need
p493
aVto make a better life for themselves,
p494
aVtheir families and their communities.
p495
aa(lp496
VSecond, it would enable lifelong learning.
p497
aVIt's a shame that for so many people,
p498
aVlearning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.
p499
aVBy having this amazing content be available,
p500
aVwe would be able to learn something new
p501
aVevery time we wanted,
p502
aVwhether it's just to expand our minds
p503
aVor it's to change our lives.
p504
aa(lp505
VAnd finally, this would enable a wave of innovation,
p506
aVbecause amazing talent can be found anywhere.
p507
aVMaybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs
p508
aVis living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.
p509
aVAnd if we could offer that person an education,
p510
aVthey would be able to come up with the next big idea
p511
aVand make the world a better place for all of us.
p512
aa(lp513
VThank you very much.

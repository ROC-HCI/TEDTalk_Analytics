VWhat was the most difficult job you ever did?
p5
aVWas it working in the sun?
p6
aVWas it working to provide food for a family or a community?
p7
aVWas it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property?
p8
aVWas it working alone
p9
aVor working on a project that wasn't guaranteed to succeed,
p10
aVbut that might improve human health or save a life?
p11
aVWas it working to build something, create something, make a work of art?
p12
aVWas it work for which you were never sure
p13
aVyou were fully understood or appreciated?
p14
aVThe people in our communities who do these jobs
p15
aVdeserve our attention, our love and our deepest support.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut people aren't the only ones in our communities
p18
aVwho do these difficult jobs.
p19
aVThese jobs are also done by the plants, the animals
p20
aVand the ecosystems on our planet,
p21
aVincluding the ecosystems I study: the tropical coral reefs.
p22
aVCoral reefs are farmers.
p23
aVThey provide food, income and food security
p24
aVfor hundreds of millions of people around the world.
p25
aVCoral reefs are security guards.
p26
aVThe structures that they build protect our shorelines
p27
aVfrom storm surge and waves,
p28
aVand the biological systems that they house filter the water
p29
aVand make it safer for us to work and play.
p30
aVCoral reefs are chemists.
p31
aVThe molecules that we're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important
p32
aVin the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs.
p33
aVAnd coral reefs are artists.
p34
aVThe structures that they build
p35
aVare some of the most beautiful things on planet Earth.
p36
aVAnd this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry
p37
aVin many countries with few or little other natural resources.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo for all of these reasons, all of these ecosystem services,
p40
aVeconomists estimate the value of the world's coral reefs
p41
aVin the hundreds of billions of dollars per year.
p42
aVAnd yet despite all that hard work being done for us
p43
aVand all that wealth that we gain,
p44
aVwe have done almost everything we possibly could to destroy that.
p45
aVWe have taken the fish out of the oceans
p46
aVand we have added in fertilizer, sewage,
p47
aVdiseases, oil, pollution, sediments.
p48
aVWe have trampled the reefs physically with our boats, our fins, our bulldozers,
p49
aVand we have changed the chemistry of the entire sea,
p50
aVwarmed the waters and made storms worse.
p51
aVAnd these would all be bad on their own,
p52
aVbut these threats magnify each other
p53
aVand compound one another and make each other worse.
p54
aa(lp55
VI'll give you an example.
p56
aVWhere I live and work, in Curaçao, a tropical storm went by a few years ago.
p57
aVAnd on the eastern end of the island,
p58
aVwhere the reefs are intact and thriving,
p59
aVyou could barely tell a tropical storm had passed.
p60
aVBut in town, where corals had died from overfishing, from pollution,
p61
aVthe tropical storm picked up the dead corals
p62
aVand used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left.
p63
aVThis is a coral that I studied during my PhD \u2014
p64
aVI got to know it quite well.
p65
aVAnd after this storm took off half of its tissue,
p66
aVit became infested with algae,
p67
aVthe algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died.
p68
aVThis magnification of threats, this compounding of factors
p69
aVis what Jeremy Jackson describes as the "slippery slope to slime."
p70
aVIt's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now
p71
aVare literally bacteria and algae and slime.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, this is the part of the talk
p74
aVwhere you may expect me to launch into my plea
p75
aVfor us to all save the coral reefs.
p76
aVBut I have a confession to make:
p77
aVthat phrase drives me nuts.
p78
aVWhether I see it in a tweet, in a news headline
p79
aVor the glossy pages of a conservation brochure,
p80
aVthat phrase bothers me,
p81
aVbecause we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms
p82
aVabout the death of coral reefs for decades.
p83
aVAnd yet, almost everyone I meet, no matter how educated,
p84
aVis not sure what a coral is or where they come from.
p85
aVHow would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs
p86
aVwhen it's an abstract thing they can barely understand?
p87
aVIf they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from,
p88
aVor how funny or interesting or beautiful it is,
p89
aVwhy would we expect them to care about saving them?
p90
aa(lp91
VSo let's change that.
p92
aVWhat is a coral and where does it come from?
p93
aVCorals are born in a number of different ways,
p94
aVbut most often by mass spawning: all of the individuals of a single species
p95
aVon one night a year,
p96
aVreleasing all the eggs they've made that year
p97
aVinto the water column,
p98
aVpackaged into bundles with sperm cells.
p99
aVAnd those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart.
p100
aVAnd hopefully \u2014 hopefully \u2014 at the surface of the ocean,
p101
aVthey meet the eggs and sperm from other corals.
p102
aVAnd that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef \u2014
p103
aVso that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface.
p104
aVWhen they're fertilized, they do what any other animal egg does:
p105
aVdivides in half again and again and again.
p106
aVTaking these photos under the microscope every year
p107
aVis one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year.
p108
aVAt the end of all this cell division, they turn into a swimming larva \u2014
p109
aVa little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed,
p110
aVbut with all of the sensory systems that we have.
p111
aVThey can sense color and light, textures, chemicals, pH.
p112
aVThey can even feel pressure waves; they can hear sound.
p113
aVAnd they use those talents
p114
aVto search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach
p115
aVand live the rest of their lives.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life
p118
aVwhen you were just two days old.
p119
aVThey attach in the place they find most suitable,
p120
aVthey build a skeleton underneath themselves,
p121
aVthey build a mouth and tentacles,
p122
aVand then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs.
p123
aVOne coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again,
p124
aVleaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself
p125
aVand growing up toward the sun.
p126
aVGiven hundreds of years and many species,
p127
aVwhat you get is a massive limestone structure
p128
aVthat can be seen from space in many cases,
p129
aVcovered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals.
p130
aVNow, there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000.
p131
aVBut these systems house millions and millions of other species,
p132
aVand that diversity is what stabilizes the systems,
p133
aVand it's where we're finding our new medicines.
p134
aVIt's how we find new sources of food.
p135
aVI'm lucky enough to work on the island of Curaçao,
p136
aVwhere we still have reefs that look like this.
p137
aVBut, indeed, much of the Caribbean and much of our world
p138
aVis much more like this.
p139
aa(lp140
VScientists have studied in increasing detail
p141
aVthe loss of the world's coral reefs,
p142
aVand they have documented with increasing certainty the causes.
p143
aVBut in my research, I'm not interested in looking backward.
p144
aVMy colleagues and I in Curaçao are interested in looking forward
p145
aVat what might be.
p146
aVAnd we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic.
p147
aVBecause even in some of these reefs
p148
aVthat we probably could have written off long ago,
p149
aVwe sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway.
p150
aVAnd we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability
p151
aVto adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't.
p152
aVThey may be able to adjust
p153
aVever so slightly more readily to this human planet.
p154
aVSo in the research I do with my colleagues in Curaçao,
p155
aVwe try to figure out what a baby coral needs
p156
aVin that critical early stage,
p157
aVwhat it's looking for
p158
aVand how we can try to help it through that process.
p159
aVI'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done
p160
aVto try to answer those questions.
p161
aa(lp162
VA few years ago we took a 3D printer and we made coral choice surveys \u2014
p163
aVdifferent colors and different textures,
p164
aVand we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle.
p165
aVAnd we found that corals, even without the biology involved,
p166
aVstill prefer white and pink, the colors of a healthy reef.
p167
aVAnd they prefer crevices and grooves and holes,
p168
aVwhere they will be safe from being trampled
p169
aVor eaten by a predator.
p170
aVSo we can use this knowledge,
p171
aVwe can go back and say we need to restore those factors \u2014
p172
aVthat pink, that white, those crevices, those hard surfaces \u2014
p173
aVin our conservation projects.
p174
aVWe can also use that knowledge
p175
aVif we're going to put something underwater, like a sea wall or a pier.
p176
aVWe can choose to use the materials and colors and textures
p177
aVthat might bias the system back toward those corals.
p178
aVNow in addition to the surfaces,
p179
aVwe also study the chemical and microbial signals
p180
aVthat attract corals to reefs.
p181
aVStarting about six years ago, I began culturing bacteria
p182
aVfrom surfaces where corals had settled.
p183
aVAnd I tried those one by one by one,
p184
aVlooking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach.
p185
aVAnd we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer
p186
aVthat will reliably cause corals
p187
aVto go through that settlement and attachment process.
p188
aVSo as we speak,
p189
aVmy colleagues in Curaçao are testing those bacteria
p190
aVto see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab,
p191
aVand to see if those coral settlers will survive better
p192
aVwhen we put them back underwater.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow in addition to these tools, we also try to uncover the mysteries
p195
aVof species that are under-studied.
p196
aVThis is one of my favorite corals, and always has been:
p197
aVdendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral.
p198
aVI love it because it makes this ridiculous shape,
p199
aVbecause its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy
p200
aVand because it's rare.
p201
aVFinding one of these on a reef is a treat.
p202
aVIn fact, it's so rare,
p203
aVthat last year it was listed as a threatened species
p204
aVon the endangered species list.
p205
aVAnd this was in part because in over 30 years of research surveys,
p206
aVscientists had never found a baby pillar coral.
p207
aVWe weren't even sure if they could still reproduce,
p208
aVor if they were still reproducing.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo four years ago, we started following these at night
p211
aVand watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in Curaçao.
p212
aVWe got some good tips from our colleagues in Florida,
p213
aVwho had seen one in 2007, one in 2008,
p214
aVand eventually we figured out when they spawn in Curaçao
p215
aVand we caught it.
p216
aVHere's a female on the left with some eggs in her tissue,
p217
aVabout to release them into the seawater.
p218
aVAnd here's a male on the right, releasing sperm.
p219
aVWe collected this, we got it back to the lab, we got it to fertilize
p220
aVand we got baby pillar corals swimming in our lab.
p221
aVThanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles,
p222
aVand thanks to the 10 years of practice we've had in Curaçao
p223
aVat raising other coral species,
p224
aVwe got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process
p225
aVand settle and attach,
p226
aVand turn into metamorphosed corals.
p227
aVSo this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd I have to say \u2014 if you think baby pandas are cute,
p232
aVthis is cuter.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VSo we're starting to figure out the secrets to this process,
p237
aVthe secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them.
p238
aVAnd this is true all around the world;
p239
aVscientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos,
p240
aVto get them to settle,
p241
aVmaybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures,
p242
aVso that we can preserve their genetic diversity
p243
aVand work with them more often.
p244
aVBut this is still so low-tech.
p245
aVWe are limited by the space on our bench, the number of hands in the lab
p246
aVand the number of coffees we can drink in any given hour.
p247
aa(lp248
VNow, compare that to our other crises
p249
aVand our other areas of concern as a society.
p250
aVWe have advanced medical technology, we have defense technology,
p251
aVwe have scientific technology,
p252
aVwe even have advanced technology for art.
p253
aVBut our technology for conservation is behind.
p254
aVThink back to the most difficult job you ever did.
p255
aVMany of you would say it was being a parent.
p256
aVMy mother described being a parent
p257
aVas something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult
p258
aVthan you could've ever possibly imagined.
p259
aVI've been trying to help corals become parents for over 10 years now.
p260
aVAnd watching the wonder of life
p261
aVhas certainly filled me with amazement to the core of my soul.
p262
aVBut I've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents.
p263
aVThe pillar corals spawned again two weeks ago,
p264
aVand we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab.
p265
aVAnd here you see one embryo dividing,
p266
aValongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize
p267
aVand will blow up.
p268
aVThey'll be infected with bacteria, they will explode
p269
aVand those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo
p270
aVthat has a chance.
p271
aVWe don't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong
p272
aVand we don't know
p273
aVif it was just this coral on this reef, always suffering from low fertility.
p274
aVWhatever the cause,
p275
aVwe have much more work to do before we can use baby corals
p276
aVto grow or fix or, yes, maybe save coral reefs.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo never mind that they're worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
p279
aVCoral reefs are hardworking animals and plants and microbes and fungi.
p280
aVThey're providing us with art and food and medicine.
p281
aVAnd we almost took out an entire generation of corals.
p282
aVBut a few made it anyway, despite our best efforts,
p283
aVand now it's time for us to thank them for the work they did
p284
aVand give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future,
p285
aVtheir coral babies.
p286
aa(lp287
VThank you so much.
p288

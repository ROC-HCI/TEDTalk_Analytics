VIn case you are wondering,
p5
aVno, I'm not wearing a dress,
p6
aVand no, I'm not saying what I'm wearing underneath.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VThis is a gho.
p11
aVThis is my national dress.
p12
aVThis is how all men dress in Bhutan.
p13
aVThat is how our women dress.
p14
aVLike our women,
p15
aVwe men get to wear pretty bright colors,
p16
aVbut unlike our women,
p17
aVwe get to show off our legs.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VOur national dress is unique,
p22
aVbut this is not the only thing that's unique about my country.
p23
aVOur promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique,
p24
aVand this is what I'd like to speak about today,
p25
aVour promise to remain carbon neutral.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut before I proceed, I should set you the context.
p28
aVI should tell you our story.
p29
aa(lp30
VBhutan is a small country in the Himalayas.
p31
aVWe've been called Shangri-La,
p32
aVeven the last Shangri-La.
p33
aVBut let me tell you right off the bat, we are not Shangri-La.
p34
aVMy country is not one big monastery
p35
aVpopulated with happy monks.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VThe reality is that there are barely 700,000 of us
p40
aVsandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth,
p41
aVChina and India.
p42
aVThe reality is that we are a small, underdeveloped country
p43
aVdoing our best to survive.
p44
aVBut we are doing OK. We are surviving.
p45
aVIn fact, we are thriving,
p46
aVand the reason we are thriving is because we've been blessed
p47
aVwith extraordinary kings.
p48
aVOur enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly
p49
aVto develop our country,
p50
aVbalancing economic growth carefully
p51
aVwith social development, environmental sustainability
p52
aVand cultural preservation,
p53
aVall within the framework of good governance.
p54
aVWe call this holistic approach to development
p55
aV"Gross National Happiness," or GNH.
p56
aVBack in the 1970s,
p57
aVour fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan,
p58
aVGross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VEver since,
p63
aVall development in Bhutan is driven by GNH,
p64
aVa pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness
p65
aVand well-being of our people.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut that's easier said than done,
p68
aVespecially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world.
p69
aVOur entire GDP is less than two billion dollars.
p70
aVI know that some of you here are worth more \u2014
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
Vindividually
p75
aVthan the entire economy of my country.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo our economy is small,
p78
aVbut here is where it gets interesting.
p79
aVEducation is completely free.
p80
aVAll citizens are guaranteed free school education,
p81
aVand those that work hard are given free college education.
p82
aVHealthcare is also completely free.
p83
aVMedical consultation, medical treatment, medicines:
p84
aVthey are all provided by the state.
p85
aVWe manage this
p86
aVbecause we use our limited resources very carefully,
p87
aVand because we stay faithful to the core mission of GNH,
p88
aVwhich is development with values.
p89
aVOur economy is small, and we must strengthen it.
p90
aVEconomic growth is important,
p91
aVbut that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture
p92
aVor our pristine environment.
p93
aa(lp94
VToday, our culture is flourishing.
p95
aVWe continue to celebrate our art and architecture,
p96
aVfood and festivals,
p97
aVmonks and monasteries.
p98
aVAnd yes, we celebrate our national dress, too.
p99
aVThis is why I can wear my gho with pride.
p100
aVHere's a fun fact:
p101
aVyou're looking at the world's biggest pocket.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VIt starts here,
p106
aVgoes around the back,
p107
aVand comes out from inside here.
p108
aVIn this pocket
p109
aVwe store all manner of personal goods
p110
aVfrom phones and wallets
p111
aVto iPads, office files and books.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VBut sometimes \u2014
p118
aVsometimes even precious cargo.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo our culture is flourishing,
p121
aVbut so is our environment.
p122
aV72 percent of my country is under forest cover.
p123
aVOur constitution demands that a minimum of 60 percent
p124
aVof Bhutan's total land shall remain under forest cover
p125
aVfor all time.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Applause)
p128
aa(lp129
VOur constitution,
p130
aVthis constitution,
p131
aVimposes forest cover on us.
p132
aVIncidentally, our king used this constitution
p133
aVto impose democracy on us.
p134
aVYou see, we the people didn't want democracy.
p135
aVWe didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,
p136
aVand we certainly didn't fight for it.
p137
aVInstead, our king imposed democracy on us
p138
aVby insisting that he include it in the constitution.
p139
aVBut he went further.
p140
aVHe included provisions in the constitution
p141
aVthat empower the people to impeach their kings,
p142
aVand included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire
p143
aVat the age of 65.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Applause)
p146
aa(lp147
VFact is, we already have a king in retirement:
p148
aVour previous king, the Great Fourth,
p149
aVretired 10 years ago
p150
aVat the peak of his popularity.
p151
aVHe was all of 51 years at that time.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo as I was saying,
p154
aV72 percent of our country is under forest cover,
p155
aVand all that forest is pristine.
p156
aVThat's why we are one of the few remaining
p157
aVglobal biodiversity hotspots in the world,
p158
aVand that's why we are a carbon neutral country.
p159
aVIn a world that is threatened with climate change,
p160
aVwe are a carbon neutral country.
p161
aa(lp162
VTurns out, it's a big deal.
p163
aVOf the 200-odd countries in the world today,
p164
aVit looks like we are the only one
p165
aVthat's carbon neutral.
p166
aVActually, that's not quite accurate.
p167
aVBhutan is not carbon neutral.
p168
aVBhutan is carbon negative.
p169
aVOur entire country generates 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,
p170
aVbut our forests, they sequester more than three times that amount,
p171
aVso we are a net carbon sink
p172
aVfor more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year.
p173
aVBut that's not all.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VWe export most of the renewable electricity
p178
aVwe generate from our fast-flowing rivers.
p179
aVSo today, the clean energy that we export
p180
aVoffsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.
p181
aVBy 2020, we'll be exporting enough electricity
p182
aVto offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide.
p183
aVAnd if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential,
p184
aVand that's exactly what we are working at,
p185
aVthe clean, green energy that we export
p186
aVwould offset something like 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.
p187
aVThat is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in one year.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo inside our country, we are a net carbon sink.
p190
aVOutside, we are offsetting carbon.
p191
aVAnd this is important stuff.
p192
aVYou see, the world is getting warmer,
p193
aVand climate change is a reality.
p194
aVClimate change is affecting my country.
p195
aVOur glaciers are melting,
p196
aVcausing flash floods and landslides,
p197
aVwhich in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction in our country.
p198
aVI was at that lake recently.
p199
aVIt's stunning.
p200
aVThat's how it looked 10 years ago,
p201
aVand that's how it looked 20 years ago.
p202
aVJust 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.
p203
aVIt was a solid glacier.
p204
aVA few years ago, a similar lake
p205
aVbreached its dams
p206
aVand wreaked havoc in the valleys below.
p207
aVThat destruction was caused by one glacier lake.
p208
aVWe have 2,700 of them to contend with.
p209
aVThe point is this:
p210
aVmy country and my people have done nothing
p211
aVto contribute to global warming,
p212
aVbut we are already bearing the brunt of its consequences.
p213
aVAnd for a small, poor country, one that is landlocked and mountainous,
p214
aVit is very difficult.
p215
aVBut we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing.
p216
aVWe will fight climate change.
p217
aVThat's why we have promised to remain carbon neutral.
p218
aa(lp219
VWe first made this promise in 2009
p220
aVduring COP 15 in Copenhagen,
p221
aVbut nobody noticed.
p222
aVGovernments were so busy arguing with one another
p223
aVand blaming each other for causing climate change,
p224
aVthat when a small country raised our hands and announced,
p225
aV"We promise to remain carbon neutral for all time,"
p226
aVnobody heard us.
p227
aVNobody cared.
p228
aa(lp229
VLast December in Paris,
p230
aVat COP 21, we reiterated our promise
p231
aVto remain carbon neutral for all time to come.
p232
aVThis time, we were heard.
p233
aVWe were noticed, and everybody cared.
p234
aVWhat was different in Paris was that governments came round together
p235
aVto accept the realities of climate change,
p236
aVand were willing to come together and act together and work together.
p237
aVAll countries, from the very small to the very large,
p238
aVcommitted to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.
p239
aVThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
p240
aVsays that if these so-called intended commitments are kept,
p241
aVwe'd be closer to containing global warming
p242
aVby two degrees Celsius.
p243
aa(lp244
VBy the way,
p245
aVI've requested the TED organizers here
p246
aVto turn up the heat in here by two degrees,
p247
aVso if some of you are feeling warmer than usual,
p248
aVyou know who to blame.
p249
aa(lp250
VIt's crucial that all of us keep our commitments.
p251
aVAs far as Bhutan is concerned,
p252
aVwe will keep our promise to remain carbon neutral.
p253
aVHere are some of the ways we are doing it.
p254
aVWe are providing free electricity to our rural farmers.
p255
aVThe idea is that, with free electricity, they will no longer have to use firewood
p256
aVto cook their food.
p257
aVWe are investing in sustainable transport
p258
aVand subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles.
p259
aVSimilarly, we are subsidizing the cost of LED lights,
p260
aVand our entire government is trying to go paperless.
p261
aVWe are cleaning up our entire country through Clean Bhutan, a national program,
p262
aVand we are planting trees throughout our country
p263
aVthrough Green Bhutan,
p264
aVanother national program.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut it is our protected areas
p267
aVthat are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy.
p268
aVOur protected areas are our carbon sink.
p269
aVThey are our lungs.
p270
aVToday, more than half our country is protected,
p271
aVas national parks, nature reserves
p272
aVand wildlife sanctuaries.
p273
aVBut the beauty is that we've connected them all with one another
p274
aVthrough a network of biological corridors.
p275
aVNow, what this means
p276
aVis that our animals are free to roam throughout our country.
p277
aVTake this tiger, for example.
p278
aVIt was spotted at 250 meters above sea level
p279
aVin the hot, subtropical jungles.
p280
aVTwo years later, that same tiger
p281
aVwas spotted near 4,000 meters
p282
aVin our cold alpine mountains.
p283
aVIsn't that awesome?
p284
aa(lp285
V(Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
VWe must keep it that way.
p288
aVWe must keep our parks awesome.
p289
aVSo every year, we set aside resources to prevent poaching, hunting,
p290
aVmining and pollution in our parks,
p291
aVand resources to help communities who live in those parks
p292
aVmanage their forests,
p293
aVadapt to climate change,
p294
aVand lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with Mother Nature.
p295
aa(lp296
VBut that is expensive.
p297
aVOver the next few years, our small economy won't have the resources
p298
aVto cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment.
p299
aVIn fact, when we run the numbers,
p300
aVit looks like it'll take us at least 15 years
p301
aVbefore we can fully finance all our conservation efforts.
p302
aVBut neither Bhutan,
p303
aVnor the world
p304
aVcan afford to spend 15 years going backwards.
p305
aa(lp306
VThis is why His Majesty the King
p307
aVstarted Bhutan For Life.
p308
aVBhutan For Life gives us the time we need.
p309
aVIt gives us breathing room.
p310
aVIt is essentially a funding mechanism
p311
aVto look after our parks,
p312
aVto protect our parks,
p313
aVuntil our government can take over on our own fully.
p314
aVThe idea is to raise a transition fund
p315
aVfrom individual donors, corporations and institutions,
p316
aVbut the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met
p317
aVand all funds committed.
p318
aVSo multiparty, single closing:
p319
aVan idea we borrowed from Wall Street.
p320
aVThis means that individual donors can commit without having to worry
p321
aVthat they'll be left supporting an underfunded plan.
p322
aVIt's something like a Kickstarter project,
p323
aVonly with a 15-year time horizon
p324
aVand millions of tons of carbon dioxide at stake.
p325
aVOnce the deal is closed,
p326
aVwe use the transition fund to protect our parks,
p327
aVgiving our government time to increase our own funding gradually
p328
aVuntil the end of the 15-year period.
p329
aVAfter that, our government guarantees full funding forever.
p330
aa(lp331
VWe are almost there.
p332
aVWe expect to close later this year.
p333
aVNaturally, I'm pretty excited.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Applause)
p336
aa(lp337
VThe World Wildlife Fund is our principle partner in this journey,
p338
aVand I want to give them a big shoutout
p339
aVfor the excellent work they are doing in Bhutan
p340
aVand across the world.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VWhew, it is getting warm in here.
p345
aa(lp346
VI thank you for listening to our story,
p347
aVa story of how we are keeping our promise to remain carbon neutral,
p348
aVa story of how we are keeping our country pristine,
p349
aVfor ourselves, our children,
p350
aVfor your children and for the world.
p351
aVBut we are not here to tell stories, are we?
p352
aVWe are here to dream together.
p353
aVSo in closing, I'd like to share one more dream that I have.
p354
aVWhat if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources,
p355
aVour influence and our passion,
p356
aVto replicate the Bhutan For Life idea to other countries
p357
aVso that they too
p358
aVcan conserve their protected areas for all time.
p359
aVAfter all, there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face.
p360
aVThey too have natural resources
p361
aVthat can help win the world's fight for sustainability,
p362
aVonly they may not have the ability to invest in them now.
p363
aVSo what if we set up Earth For Life,
p364
aVa global fund, to kickstart the Bhutan For Life throughout the world?
p365
aVI invite you to help me,
p366
aVto carry this dream beyond our borders
p367
aVto all those who care about our planet's future.
p368
aVAfter all, we're here to dream together,
p369
aVto work together,
p370
aVto fight climate change together, to protect our planet together.
p371
aVBecause the reality is
p372
aVwe are in it together.
p373
aVSome of us might dress differently,
p374
aVbut we are in it together.
p375
aa(lp376
VThank you very much,
p377
aVand kadrin chhe la. Thank you.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Applause)
p380
aa(lp381
VThank you, thank you, thank you.

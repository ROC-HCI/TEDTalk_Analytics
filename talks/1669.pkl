VSo, why does good sex so often fade,
p5
aVeven for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever?
p6
aVAnd why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex,
p7
aVcontrary to popular belief?
p8
aVOr, the next question would be,
p9
aVcan we want what we already have?
p10
aVThat's the million-dollar question, right?
p11
aVAnd why is the forbidden so erotic?
p12
aVWhat is it about transgression that makes desire so potent?
p13
aVAnd why does sex make babies,
p14
aVand babies spell erotic disaster in couples?
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VIt's kind of the fatal erotic blow, isn't it?
p19
aVAnd when you love, how does it feel?
p20
aVAnd when you desire, how is it different?
p21
aa(lp22
VThese are some of the questions
p23
aVthat are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire
p24
aVand its concomitant dilemmas in modern love.
p25
aVSo I travel the globe,
p26
aVand what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered,
p27
aVthere seems to be a crisis of desire.
p28
aVA crisis of desire, as in owning the wanting \u2014
p29
aVdesire as an expression of our individuality,
p30
aVof our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity \u2014
p31
aVdesire that has become a central concept
p32
aVas part of modern love and individualistic societies.
p33
aa(lp34
VYou know, this is the first time in the history of humankind
p35
aVwhere we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term
p36
aVnot because we want 14 children,
p37
aVfor which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it,
p38
aVand not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty.
p39
aVThis is the first time that we want sex over time
p40
aVabout pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo what sustains desire, and why is it so difficult?
p43
aVAnd at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship,
p44
aVI think, is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs.
p45
aVOn the one hand, our need for security, for predictability,
p46
aVfor safety, for dependability,
p47
aVfor reliability, for permanence.
p48
aVAll these anchoring, grounding experiences of our lives
p49
aVthat we call home.
p50
aVBut we also have an equally strong need \u2014 men and women \u2014
p51
aVfor adventure, for novelty,
p52
aVfor mystery, for risk, for danger,
p53
aVfor the unknown, for the unexpected, surprise \u2014
p54
aVyou get the gist.
p55
aVFor journey, for travel.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure
p58
aVinto one relationship,
p59
aVor what we today like to call a passionate marriage,
p60
aVused to be a contradiction in terms.
p61
aVMarriage was an economic institution
p62
aVin which you were given a partnership for life
p63
aVin terms of children and social status
p64
aVand succession and companionship.
p65
aVBut now we want our partner to still give us all these things,
p66
aVbut in addition I want you to be my best friend
p67
aVand my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot,
p68
aVand we live twice as long.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VSo we come to one person, and we basically are asking them
p73
aVto give us what once an entire village used to provide.
p74
aVGive me belonging, give me identity,
p75
aVgive me continuity,
p76
aVbut give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one.
p77
aVGive me comfort, give me edge.
p78
aVGive me novelty, give me familiarity.
p79
aVGive me predictability, give me surprise.
p80
aVAnd we think it's a given,
p81
aVand toys and lingerie are going to save us with that.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
V(Applause)
p86
aa(lp87
VSo now we get to the existential reality of the story, right?
p88
aVBecause I think, in some way \u2014
p89
aVand I'll come back to that \u2014
p90
aVbut the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo why does good sex so often fade?
p93
aVWhat is the relationship between love and desire?
p94
aVHow do they relate, and how do they conflict?
p95
aVBecause therein lies the mystery of eroticism.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo if there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it's "to have."
p98
aVAnd if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is "to want."
p99
aVIn love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved.
p100
aVWe want to minimize the distance.
p101
aVWe want to contract that gap.
p102
aVWe want to neutralize the tensions.
p103
aVWe want closeness.
p104
aVBut in desire,
p105
aVwe tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone.
p106
aVForgone conclusion does not keep our interest.
p107
aVIn desire, we want an Other,
p108
aVsomebody on the other side that we can go visit,
p109
aVthat we can go spend some time with,
p110
aVthat we can go see what goes on in their red-light district.
p111
aVYou know?
p112
aVIn desire, we want a bridge to cross.
p113
aVOr in other words, I sometimes say, fire needs air.
p114
aVDesire needs space.
p115
aVAnd when it's said like that, it's often quite abstract.
p116
aa(lp117
VBut then I took a question with me.
p118
aVAnd I've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years
p119
aVwith "Mating in Captivity," and I asked people,
p120
aVwhen do you find yourself most drawn to your partner?
p121
aVNot attracted sexually, per Se, but most drawn.
p122
aVAnd across culture, across religion, and across gender \u2014 except for one \u2014
p123
aVthere are a few answers that just keep coming back.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo the first group is:
p126
aVI am most drawn to my partner when she is away,
p127
aVwhen we are apart, when we reunite.
p128
aVBasically, when I get back in touch
p129
aVwith my ability to imagine myself with my partner,
p130
aVwhen my imagination comes back in the picture,
p131
aVand when I can root it in absence and in longing,
p132
aVwhich is a major component of desire.
p133
aa(lp134
VBut then the second group is even more interesting.
p135
aVI am most drawn to my partner
p136
aVwhen I see him in the studio,
p137
aVwhen she is onstage,
p138
aVwhen he is in his element,
p139
aVwhen she's doing something she's passionate about,
p140
aVwhen I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him,
p141
aVwhen I see her hold court.
p142
aVBasically, when I look at my partner radiant and confident.
p143
aVProbably the biggest turn-on across the board.
p144
aVRadiant, as in self-sustaining.
p145
aVI look at this person \u2014 by the way, in desire
p146
aVpeople rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one,
p147
aVfive centimeters from each other.
p148
aVI don't know in inches how much that is.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut it's also not when the other person is that far apart
p151
aVthat you no longer see them.
p152
aVIt's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance,
p153
aVwhere this person that is already so familiar, so known,
p154
aVis momentarily once again somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.
p155
aVAnd in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan,
p156
aVlies that movement toward the other.
p157
aVBecause sometimes, as Proust says,
p158
aVmystery is not about traveling to new places,
p159
aVbut it's about looking with new eyes.
p160
aVAnd so, when I see my partner on his own or her own,
p161
aVdoing something in which they are enveloped,
p162
aVI look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception,
p163
aVand I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd then, more importantly, in this description about the other
p166
aVor myself \u2014 it's the same \u2014
p167
aVwhat is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire.
p168
aVNobody needs anybody.
p169
aVThere is no caretaking in desire.
p170
aVCaretaking is mightily loving.
p171
aVIt's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VI have yet to see somebody who is so turned on
p176
aVby somebody who needs them.
p177
aVWanting them is one thing.
p178
aVNeeding them is a shot down
p179
aVand women have known that forever,
p180
aVbecause anything that will bring up parenthood
p181
aVwill usually decrease the erotic charge.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VFor good reasons, right?
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd then the third group of answers usually would be:
p188
aVwhen I'm surprised, when we laugh together,
p189
aVas somebody said to me in the office today,
p190
aVwhen he's in his tux, so I said, you know,
p191
aVit's either the tux or the cowboy boots.
p192
aVBut basically it's when there is novelty.
p193
aVBut novelty isn't about new positions.
p194
aVIt isn't a repertoire of techniques.
p195
aVNovelty is, what parts of you do you bring out?
p196
aVWhat parts of you are just being seen?
p197
aa(lp198
VBecause in some way one could say sex isn't something you do, eh?
p199
aVSex is a place you go.
p200
aVIt's a space you enter
p201
aVinside yourself and with another, or others.
p202
aVSo where do you go in sex?
p203
aVWhat parts of you do you connect to?
p204
aVWhat do you seek to express there?
p205
aVIs it a place for transcendence and spiritual union?
p206
aVIs it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive?
p207
aVIs it a place where you can finally surrender
p208
aVand not have to take responsibility for everything?
p209
aVIs it a place where you can express your infantile wishes?
p210
aVWhat comes out there? It's a language.
p211
aVIt isn't just a behavior.
p212
aVAnd it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in,
p213
aVwhich is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence.
p214
aa(lp215
VYou know, animals have sex.
p216
aVIt's the pivot, it's biology, it's the natural instinct.
p217
aVWe are the only ones who have an erotic life,
p218
aVwhich means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination.
p219
aVWe are the only ones who can make love for hours,
p220
aVhave a blissful time, multiple orgasms,
p221
aVand touch nobody, just because we can imagine it.
p222
aVWe can hint at it. We don't even have to do it.
p223
aVWe can experience that powerful thing called anticipation,
p224
aVwhich is a mortar to desire.
p225
aVThe ability to imagine it, as if it's happening,
p226
aVto experience it as if it's happening,
p227
aVwhile nothing is happening
p228
aVand everything is happening, at the same time.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo when I began to think about eroticism,
p231
aVI began to think about the poetics of sex.
p232
aVAnd if I look at it as an intelligence,
p233
aVthen it's something that you cultivate.
p234
aVWhat are the ingredients?
p235
aVImagination, playfulness,
p236
aVnovelty, curiosity, mystery.
p237
aVBut the central agent is really that piece called the imagination.
p238
aa(lp239
VBut more importantly, for me to begin to understand
p240
aVwho are the couples who have an erotic spark,
p241
aVwhat sustains desire,
p242
aVI had to go back to the original definition of eroticism,
p243
aVthe mystical definition,
p244
aVand I went through it through a bifurcation
p245
aVby looking, actually, at trauma,
p246
aVwhich is the other side.
p247
aVAnd I looked at it,
p248
aVlooking at the community that I had grown up in,
p249
aVwhich was a community in Belgium, all Holocaust survivors,
p250
aVand in my community, there were two groups:
p251
aVthose who didn't die, and those who came back to life.
p252
aVAnd those who didn't die lived often very tethered to the ground,
p253
aVcould not experience pleasure, could not trust,
p254
aVbecause when you're vigilant, worried, anxious, and insecure,
p255
aVyou can't lift your head to go and take off in space
p256
aVand be playful and safe and imaginative.
p257
aVThose who came back to life
p258
aVwere those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death.
p259
aVThey knew how to keep themselves alive.
p260
aVAnd when I began to listen
p261
aVto the sexlessness of the couples that I work with,
p262
aVI sometimes would hear people say, "I want more sex,"
p263
aVbut generally, people want better sex,
p264
aVand better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness,
p265
aVof vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality,
p266
aVof Eros, of energy
p267
aVthat sex used to afford them,
p268
aVor that they've hoped it would afford them.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd so I began to ask a different question.
p271
aV"I shut myself off when ..." began to be the question.
p272
aV"I turn off my desires when ..."
p273
aVWhich is not the same question as,
p274
aV"What turns me off is ..." and "You turn me off when ..."
p275
aVAnd people began to say, "I turn myself off when
p276
aVI feel dead inside, when I don't like my body,
p277
aVwhen I feel old,
p278
aVwhen I haven't had time for myself,
p279
aVwhen I haven't had a chance to even check in with you,
p280
aVwhen I don't perform well at work,
p281
aVwhen I feel low self esteem,
p282
aVwhen I don't have a sense of self-worth,
p283
aVwhen I don't feel like I have a right to want, to take,
p284
aVto receive pleasure."
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd then I began to ask the reverse question.
p287
aV"I turn myself on when ..."
p288
aVBecause most of the time, people like to ask the question,
p289
aV"You turn me on, what turns me on,"
p290
aVand I'm out of the question, you know?
p291
aVNow, if you are dead inside,
p292
aVthe other person can do a lot of things for Valentine's.
p293
aVIt won't make a dent. There is nobody at the reception desk.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VSo I turn myself on when,
p298
aVI turn on my desires, I wake up when ...
p299
aa(lp300
VNow, in this paradox between love and desire,
p301
aVwhat seems to be so puzzling
p302
aVis that the very ingredients that nurture love \u2014
p303
aVmutuality, reciprocity,
p304
aVprotection, worry, responsibility for the other \u2014
p305
aVare sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire.
p306
aVBecause desire comes with a host of feelings
p307
aVthat are not always such favorites of love:
p308
aVjealousy, possessiveness,
p309
aVaggression, power, dominance,
p310
aVnaughtiness, mischief.
p311
aVBasically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things
p312
aVthat we will demonstrate against during the day.
p313
aVYou know, the erotic mind is not very politically correct.
p314
aVIf everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses,
p315
aVwe wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Laughter)
p318
aa(lp319
VBut no, in our mind up there are a host of things going on
p320
aVthat we don't always know how to bring to the person that we love,
p321
aVbecause we think love comes with selflessness
p322
aVand in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness
p323
aVin the best sense of the word:
p324
aVthe ability to stay connected to one's self in the presence of another.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo I want to draw that little image for you,
p327
aVbecause this need to reconcile these two sets of needs,
p328
aVwe are born with that.
p329
aVOur need for connection, our need for separateness,
p330
aVor our need for security and adventure,
p331
aVor our need for togetherness and for autonomy,
p332
aVand if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap
p333
aVand who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable,
p334
aVand at some point all of us need to go out into the world
p335
aVto discover and to explore.
p336
aVThat's the beginning of desire,
p337
aVthat exploratory need, curiosity, discovery.
p338
aVAnd then at some point they turn around and they look at you.
p339
aVAnd if you tell them,
p340
aV"Hey kiddo, the world's a great place.
p341
aVGo for it. There's so much fun out there,"
p342
aVthen they can turn away and they can experience
p343
aVconnection and separateness at the same time.
p344
aVThey can go off in their imagination, off in their body,
p345
aVoff in their playfulness,
p346
aVall the while knowing that there's somebody when they come back.
p347
aa(lp348
VBut if on this side there is somebody who says,
p349
aV"I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed.
p350
aVMy partner hasn't taken care of me in so long.
p351
aVWhat's so good out there?
p352
aVDon't we have everything you need together, you and I?"
p353
aVthen there are a few little reactions
p354
aVthat all of us can pretty much recognize.
p355
aVSome of us will come back,
p356
aVcame back a long time ago,
p357
aVand that little child who comes back
p358
aVis the child who will forgo a part of himself
p359
aVin order not to lose the other.
p360
aVI will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection.
p361
aVAnd I will learn to love in a certain way
p362
aVthat will become burdened with extra worry
p363
aVand extra responsibility and extra protection,
p364
aVand I won't know how to leave you
p365
aVin order to go play, in order to go experience pleasure,
p366
aVin order to discover, to enter inside myself.
p367
aa(lp368
VTranslate this into adult language.
p369
aVIt starts very young.
p370
aVIt continues into our sex lives up to the end.
p371
aVChild number two comes back
p372
aVbut looks like that over their shoulder all the time.
p373
aV"Are you going to be there?
p374
aVAre you going to curse me, scold me?
p375
aVAre you going to be angry with me?"
p376
aVAnd they may be gone, but they're never really away.
p377
aVAnd those are often the people that will tell you,
p378
aV"In the beginning, it was super hot."
p379
aVBecause in the beginning,
p380
aVthe growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong
p381
aVthat it actually led to the decrease of desire.
p382
aVThe more connected I became, the more responsible I felt,
p383
aVthe less I was able to let go in your presence.
p384
aVThe third child doesn't really come back.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo what happens, if you want to sustain desire,
p387
aVit's that real dialectic piece.
p388
aVOn the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go.
p389
aVOn the other hand if you can't go, you can't have pleasure,
p390
aVyou can't culminate, you don't have an orgasm,
p391
aVyou don't get excited because you spend your time
p392
aVin the body and the head of the other and not in your own.
p393
aa(lp394
VSo in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs,
p395
aVthere are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do.
p396
aVOne, they have a lot of sexual privacy.
p397
aVThey understand that there is an erotic space
p398
aVthat belongs to each of them.
p399
aVThey also understand that foreplay is not something you do
p400
aVfive minutes before the real thing.
p401
aVForeplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm.
p402
aVThey also understand that an erotic space isn't about,
p403
aVyou begin to stroke the other.
p404
aVIt's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc.,
p405
aVmaybe where you leave the Agile program \u2014
p406
aa(lp407
V(Laughter)
p408
aa(lp409
VAnd you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen
p410
aVwho is taking care of things and being responsible.
p411
aa(lp412
VResponsibility and desire just butt heads.
p413
aVThey don't really do well together.
p414
aVErotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes.
p415
aVIt's pretty much like the moon.
p416
aVIt has intermittent eclipses.
p417
aVBut what they know is they know how to resurrect it.
p418
aVThey know how to bring it back.
p419
aVAnd they know how to bring it back
p420
aVbecause they have demystified one big myth,
p421
aVwhich is the myth of spontaneity,
p422
aVwhich is that it's just going to fall from heaven
p423
aVwhile you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina,
p424
aVand in fact they understood
p425
aVthat whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship, already has.
p426
aa(lp427
VCommitted sex is premeditated sex.
p428
aVIt's willful. It's intentional.
p429
aVIt's focus and presence.
p430
aa(lp431
VMerry Valentine's.

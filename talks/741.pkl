VAs a magician, I try to create images that make people stop and think.
p5
aVI also try to challenge myself
p6
aVto do things that doctors say are not possible.
p7
aVI was buried alive in New York City in a coffin,
p8
aVburied alive in a coffin in April, 1999, for a week.
p9
aVI lived there with nothing but water.
p10
aVAnd it ended up being so much fun
p11
aVthat I decided I could pursue doing more of these things.
p12
aVThe next one is I froze myself in a block of ice
p13
aVfor three days and three nights in New York City.
p14
aVThat one was way more difficult than I had expected.
p15
aVThe one after that, I stood on top of a hundred-foot pillar
p16
aVfor 36 hours.
p17
aVI began to hallucinate so hard
p18
aVthat the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, next I went to London.
p21
aVIn London I lived in a glass box for 44 days
p22
aVwith nothing but water.
p23
aVIt was, for me, one of the most difficult things I'd ever done,
p24
aVbut it was also the most beautiful.
p25
aVThere was so many skeptics, especially the press in London,
p26
aVthat they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VSo, I felt very validated
p31
aVwhen the New England Journal of Medicine actually used the research for science.
p32
aa(lp33
VMy next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing,
p34
aVlike how long I could survive with nothing, not even air.
p35
aVI didn't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life.
p36
aa(lp37
VAs a young magician,
p38
aVI was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges.
p39
aVSo, I began, early on, competing against the other kids,
p40
aVseeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe,
p41
aVyou know, five times, while I stayed under on one breath.
p42
aVBy the time I was a teenager,
p43
aVI was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds.
p44
aVI would later find out that was Houdini's personal record.
p45
aa(lp46
VIn 1987 I heard of a story
p47
aVabout a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river.
p48
aVHe was underneath, not breathing for 45 minutes.
p49
aVWhen the rescue workers came,
p50
aVthey resuscitated him and there was no brain damage.
p51
aVHis core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees.
p52
aVAs a magician, I think everything is possible.
p53
aVAnd I think if something is done by one person,
p54
aVit can be done by others.
p55
aVI started to think,
p56
aVif the boy could survive without breathing for that long,
p57
aVthere must be a way that I could do it.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo, I met with a top neurosurgeon.
p60
aVAnd I asked him, how long is it possible to go without breathing,
p61
aVlike how long could I go without air?
p62
aVAnd he said to me that anything over six minutes
p63
aVyou have a serious risk of hypoxic brain damage.
p64
aVSo, I took that as a challenge, basically.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VMy first try, I figured that I could do something similar,
p69
aVand I created a water tank,
p70
aVand I filled it with ice and freezing cold water.
p71
aVAnd I stayed inside of that water tank
p72
aVhoping my core temperature would start to drop.
p73
aVAnd I was shivering.
p74
aVIn my first attempt to hold my breath, I couldn't even last a minute.
p75
aVSo, I realized that was completely not going to work.
p76
aa(lp77
VI went to talk to a doctor friend \u2014
p78
aVand I asked him, "How could I do that?"
p79
aV"I want to hold my breath for a really long time. How could it be done?"
p80
aVAnd he said, "David, you're a magician,
p81
aVcreate the illusion of not breathing, it will be much easier."
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VSo, he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather,
p86
aVwith a CO2 scrubber,
p87
aVwhich was basically a tube from Home Depot,
p88
aVwith a balloon duct-taped to it,
p89
aVthat he thought we could put inside of me,
p90
aVand somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe
p91
aVwith this thing in me.
p92
aVThis is a little hard to watch.
p93
aVBut this is that attempt.
p94
aVSo, that clearly wasn't going to work.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VThen I actually started thinking about liquid breathing.
p99
aVThere is a chemical that's called perflubron.
p100
aVAnd it's so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it.
p101
aVSo, I got my hands on that chemical,
p102
aVfilled the sink up with it, and stuck my face in the sink
p103
aVand tried to breathe that in, which was really impossible.
p104
aVIt's basically like trying to breathe, as a doctor said,
p105
aVwhile having an elephant standing on your chest.
p106
aVSo, that idea disappeared.
p107
aa(lp108
VThen I started thinking,
p109
aVwould it be possible to hook up a heart/lung bypass machine
p110
aVand have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery,
p111
aVand then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood?
p112
aVWhich was another insane idea, obviously.
p113
aa(lp114
VThen I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas:
p115
aVto actually do it.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VTo actually try to hold my breath past the point
p120
aVthat doctors would consider you brain dead.
p121
aVSo, I started researching into pearl divers.
p122
aVYou know, because they go down for four minutes on one breath.
p123
aVAnd when I was researching pearl divers, I found the world of free-diving.
p124
aVIt was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered, pretty much.
p125
aVThere is many different aspects to free-diving.
p126
aVThere is depth records, where people go as deep as they can.
p127
aVAnd then there is static apnea.
p128
aVThat's holding your breath as long as you can
p129
aVin one place without moving.
p130
aVThat was the one that I studied.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe first thing that I learned is when you're holding your breath,
p133
aVyou should never move at all; that wastes energy.
p134
aVAnd that depletes oxygen,
p135
aVand it builds up CO2 in your blood.
p136
aVSo, I learned never to move.
p137
aVAnd I learned how to slow my heart rate down.
p138
aVI had to remain perfectly still and just relax
p139
aVand think that I wasn't in my body, and just control that.
p140
aVAnd then I learned how to purge.
p141
aVPurging is basically hyperventilating.
p142
aVYou blow in and out \u2014
p143
aa(lp144
V(Breathing loudly)
p145
aa(lp146
VYou do that, you get lightheaded, you get tingling.
p147
aVAnd you're really ridding your body of CO2.
p148
aVSo, when you hold your breath, it's infinitely easier.
p149
aVThen I learned that you have to take a huge breath,
p150
aVand just hold and relax and never let any air out,
p151
aVand just hold and relax through all the pain.
p152
aa(lp153
VEvery morning, this is for months,
p154
aVI would wake up and the first thing that I would do
p155
aVis I would hold my breath
p156
aVfor, out of 52 minutes, I would hold my breath for 44 minutes.
p157
aVSo, basically what that means is I would purge,
p158
aVI'd breathe really hard for a minute.
p159
aVAnd I would hold, immediately after, for five and a half minutes.
p160
aVThen I would breathe again for a minute, purging as hard as I can,
p161
aVthen immediately after that I would hold again for five and a half minutes.
p162
aVI would repeat this process eight times in a row.
p163
aVOut of 52 minutes, you're only breathing for eight minutes.
p164
aVAt the end of that you're completely fried, your brain.
p165
aVYou feel like you're walking around in a daze.
p166
aVAnd you have these awful headaches.
p167
aVBasically, I'm not the best person to talk to when I'm doing that stuff.
p168
aa(lp169
VI started learning about the world-record holder.
p170
aVHis name is Tom Sietas.
p171
aVAnd this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath.
p172
aVHe's six foot four. He's 160 pounds.
p173
aVAnd his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person.
p174
aVI'm six foot one, and fat.
p175
aVWe'll say big-boned.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VI had to drop 50 pounds in three months.
p180
aVSo, everything that I put into my body, I considered as medicine.
p181
aVEvery bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value.
p182
aVI ate really small controlled portions throughout the day.
p183
aVAnd I started to really adapt my body.
p184
aa(lp185
V[Individual results may vary]
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VThe thinner I was, the longer I was able to hold my breath.
p190
aVAnd by eating so well and training so hard,
p191
aVmy resting heart-rate dropped to 38 beats per minute.
p192
aVWhich is lower than most Olympic athletes.
p193
aVIn four months of training,
p194
aVI was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes.
p195
aVI wanted to try holding my breath everywhere.
p196
aVI wanted to try it in the most extreme situations
p197
aVto see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VI decided that I was going to break the world record
p202
aVlive on prime-time television.
p203
aVThe world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds,
p204
aVheld by Tom Sietas, that guy with the whale lungs I told you about.
p205
aVI assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln Center
p206
aVand if I stayed there a week not eating,
p207
aVI would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism,
p208
aVwhich I was sure would help me hold my breath
p209
aVlonger than I had been able to do it.
p210
aVI was completely wrong.
p211
aa(lp212
VI entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date.
p213
aVAnd I thought everything seemed to be on track.
p214
aVTwo days before my big breath-hold attempt, for the record,
p215
aVthe producers of my television special
p216
aVthought that just watching somebody holding their breath, and almost drowning,
p217
aVis too boring for television.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VSo, I had to add handcuffs, while holding my breath, to escape from.
p222
aVThis was a critical mistake.
p223
aVBecause of the movement, I was wasting oxygen.
p224
aVAnd by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions.
p225
aVBy 7:08, I started to black out.
p226
aVAnd by seven minutes and 30 seconds,
p227
aVthey had to pull my body out and bring me back.
p228
aVI had failed on every level.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VSo, naturally, the only way out of the slump that I could think of was,
p233
aVI decided to call Oprah.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VI told her that I wanted to up the ante
p238
aVand hold my breath longer than any human being ever had.
p239
aVThis was a different record.
p240
aVThis was a pure O2 static apnea record
p241
aVthat Guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes.
p242
aVSo, basically you breathe pure O2 first, oxygenating your body, flushing out CO2,
p243
aVand you are able to hold much longer.
p244
aVI realized that my real competition was the beaver.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter ends)
p249
aa(lp250
VIn January of '08,
p251
aVOprah gave me four months to prepare and train.
p252
aVSo, I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night.
p253
aVA hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15,000 feet.
p254
aVSo, it's like base camp, Everest.
p255
aVWhat that does is, you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body,
p256
aVwhich helps you carry oxygen better.
p257
aVEvery morning, again, after getting out of that tent,
p258
aVyour brain is completely wiped out.
p259
aVMy first attempt on pure O2, I was able to go up to 15 minutes.
p260
aVSo, it was a pretty big success.
p261
aa(lp262
VThe neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water
p263
aVbecause in his mind, at 15 minutes your brain is done, you're brain dead.
p264
aVSo, he pulled me up, and I was fine.
p265
aVThere was one person there that was definitely not impressed.
p266
aVIt was my ex-girlfriend.
p267
aVWhile I was breaking the record underwater for the first time,
p268
aVshe was sifting through my Blackberry, checking all my messages.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VMy brother had a picture of it. It is really \u2014
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter ends)
p277
aa(lp278
VI then announced that I was going to go for Sietas' record, publicly.
p279
aVAnd what he did in response, is he went on Regis and Kelly,
p280
aVand broke his old record.
p281
aVThen his main competitor went out and broke his record.
p282
aVSo, he suddenly pushed the record up to 16 minutes and 32 seconds.
p283
aVWhich was three minutes longer than I had prepared.
p284
aVIt was longer than the record.
p285
aa(lp286
VI wanted to get the Science Times to document this.
p287
aVI wanted to get them to do a piece on it.
p288
aVSo, I did what any person
p289
aVseriously pursuing scientific advancement would do.
p290
aVI walked into the New York Times offices and did card tricks to everybody.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VSo, I don't know if it was the magic or the lure of the Cayman Islands,
p295
aVbut John Tierney flew down
p296
aVand did a piece on the seriousness of breath-holding.
p297
aa(lp298
VWhile he was there, I tried to impress him, of course.
p299
aVAnd I did a dive down to 160 feet,
p300
aVwhich is basically the height of a 16 story building,
p301
aVand as I was coming up, I blacked out underwater,
p302
aVwhich is really dangerous; that's how you drown.
p303
aVLuckily, Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo, I started full focus.
p306
aVI completely trained to get my breath-hold time up
p307
aVfor what I needed to do.
p308
aVBut there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it,
p309
aVbeing on Oprah.
p310
aVBut in practice, I would do it face down, floating on the pool.
p311
aVBut for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face, basically.
p312
aVThe other problem was the suit was so buoyant
p313
aVthat they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up.
p314
aVSo, I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose,
p315
aVwhich was a real problem for me.
p316
aVThat made me extremely nervous, raising the heart rate.
p317
aa(lp318
VThen, what they also did was,
p319
aVwhich we never did before, is there was a heart-rate monitor.
p320
aVAnd it was right next to the sphere.
p321
aVSo, every time my heart would beat, I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,
p322
aVyou know, the ticking, really loud.
p323
aVWhich was making me more nervous.
p324
aVAnd there was no way to slow my heart rate down.
p325
aVNormally, I would start at 38 beats per minute,
p326
aVand while holding my breath, it would drop to 12 beats per minute,
p327
aVwhich is pretty unusual.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VThis time it started at 120 beats, and it never went down.
p332
aVI spent the first five minutes underwater
p333
aVdesperately trying to slow my heart rate down.
p334
aVI was just sitting there thinking,
p335
aV"I've got to slow this down. I'm going to fail."
p336
aVAnd I was getting more nervous.
p337
aVAnd the heart rate just kept going up and up,
p338
aVall the way up to 150 beats.
p339
aVBasically it's the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center.
p340
aVIt was a waste of O2.
p341
aVWhen I made it to the halfway mark, at eight minutes,
p342
aVI was 100 percent certain
p343
aVthat I was not going to be able to make this.
p344
aVThere was no way for me to do it.
p345
aa(lp346
VI figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour
p347
aVto doing this breath-hold thing, if I had cracked early,
p348
aVit would be a whole show about how depressed I am.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VSo, I figured I'm better off just fighting and staying there until I black out,
p353
aVat least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VI kept pushing to 10 minutes.
p358
aVAt 10 minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations
p359
aVin your fingers and toes.
p360
aVAnd I knew that that was blood shunting,
p361
aVwhen the blood rushes away from your extremities
p362
aVto provide oxygen to your vital organs.
p363
aVAt 11 minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs,
p364
aVand my lips started to feel really strange.
p365
aa(lp366
VAt minute 12 I started to have ringing in my ears,
p367
aVand I started to feel my arm going numb.
p368
aVAnd I'm a hypochondriac, and I remember arm numb means heart attack.
p369
aVSo, I started to really get really paranoid.
p370
aVThen at 13 minutes, maybe because of the hypochondria,
p371
aVI started feeling pains all over my chest.
p372
aVIt was awful.
p373
aa(lp374
V(Laughter)
p375
aa(lp376
VAt 14 minutes, I had these awful contractions,
p377
aVlike this urge to breathe.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter ends)
p382
aa(lp383
VAt 15 minutes I was suffering major O2 deprivation to the heart.
p384
aVAnd I started having ischemia to the heart.
p385
aVMy heartbeat would go from 120 to 50,
p386
aVto 150, to 40, to 20, to 150 again.
p387
aVIt would skip a beat.
p388
aVIt would start. It would stop. And I felt all this.
p389
aVAnd I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo, at 16 minutes what I did is I slid my feet out
p392
aVbecause I knew that if I did go out, if I did have a heart attack,
p393
aVthey'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out
p394
aVbefore pulling me up.
p395
aVI was really nervous.
p396
aVI let my feet out, and I started floating to the top.
p397
aVAnd I didn't take my head out.
p398
aVBut I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop,
p399
aVjust waiting.
p400
aa(lp401
VThey had doctors with the "Pst," you know, sitting there waiting.
p402
aVAnd then suddenly I hear screaming.
p403
aVAnd I think that there is some weird thing \u2014
p404
aVthat I had died or something had happened.
p405
aVAnd then I realized that I had made it to 16:32.
p406
aVSo, with the energy of everybody that was there,
p407
aVI decided to keep pushing.
p408
aVAnd I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.
p409
aa(lp410
V(Applause)
p411
aa(lp412
V(Applause ends)
p413
aa(lp414
VAs though that wasn't enough, what I did immediately after
p415
aVis I went to Quest Labs
p416
aVand had them take every blood sample that they could
p417
aVto test for everything and to see where my levels were,
p418
aVso the doctors could use it, once again.
p419
aVI also didn't want anybody to question it.
p420
aVI had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate.
p421
aa(lp422
VSo, I get to New York City the next day,
p423
aVI'm walking out of the Apple store,
p424
aVand this kid walks up to me he's like, "Yo, D!"
p425
aVI'm like "Yeah?"
p426
aVHe said, "If you really held your breath that long,
p427
aVwhy'd you come out of the water dry?"
p428
aVI was like "What?"
p429
aa(lp430
V(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
VAnd that's my life. So \u2014
p433
aa(lp434
V(Laughter)
p435
aa(lp436
VAs a magician, I try to show things to people
p437
aVthat seem impossible.
p438
aVAnd I think magic,
p439
aVwhether I'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards,
p440
aVis pretty simple.
p441
aVIt's practice, it's training, and it's \u2014 (Sobs)
p442
aVIt's practice, it's training and experimenting,
p443
aa(lp444
V(Sobs)
p445
aa(lp446
Vwhile pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be.
p447
aVAnd that's what magic is to me, so, thank you.

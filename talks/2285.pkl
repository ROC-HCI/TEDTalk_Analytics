VA few years ago,
p5
aVmy mom developed rheumatoid arthritis.
p6
aVHer wrists, knees and toes swelled up, causing crippling, chronic pain.
p7
aVShe had to file for disability.
p8
aVShe stopped attending our local mosque.
p9
aVSome mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth.
p10
aVI wanted to help.
p11
aVBut I didn't know how.
p12
aVI'm not a doctor.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, what I am is a historian of medicine.
p15
aVSo I started to research the history of chronic pain.
p16
aVTurns out, UCLA has an entire history of pain collection
p17
aVin their archives.
p18
aVAnd I found a story \u2014 a fantastic story \u2014
p19
aVof a man who saved \u2014 rescued \u2014 millions of people from pain;
p20
aVpeople like my mom.
p21
aVYet, I had never heard of him.
p22
aVThere were no biographies of him, no Hollywood movies.
p23
aVHis name was John J. Bonica.
p24
aVBut when our story begins,
p25
aVhe was better known as Johnny "Bull" Walker.
p26
aa(lp27
VIt was a summer day in 1941.
p28
aVThe circus had just arrived in the tiny town of Brookfield, New York.
p29
aVSpectators flocked to see the wire-walkers, the tramp clowns \u2014
p30
aVif they were lucky, the human cannonball.
p31
aVThey also came to see the strongman, Johnny "Bull" Walker,
p32
aVa brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar.
p33
aVYou know, on that particular day, a voice rang out
p34
aVover the circus P.A. system.
p35
aVThey needed a doctor urgently, in the live animal tent.
p36
aVSomething had gone wrong with the lion tamer.
p37
aVThe climax of his act had gone wrong,
p38
aVand his head was stuck inside the lion's mouth.
p39
aVHe was running out of air;
p40
aVthe crowd watched in horror
p41
aVas he struggled and then passed out.
p42
aVWhen the lion finally did relax its jaws,
p43
aVthe lion tamer just slumped to the ground, motionless.
p44
aVWhen he came to a few minutes later,
p45
aVhe saw a familiar figure hunched over him.
p46
aVIt was Bull Walker.
p47
aVThe strongman had given the lion tamer mouth-to-mouth, and saved his life.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, the strongman hadn't told anyone,
p50
aVbut he was actually a third-year medical student.
p51
aVHe toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition,
p52
aVbut kept it a secret to protect his persona.
p53
aVHe was supposed to be a brute, a villain \u2014
p54
aVnot a nerdy do-gooder.
p55
aVHis medical colleagues didn't know his secret, either.
p56
aVAs he put it, "If you were an athlete, you were a dumb dodo."
p57
aVSo he didn't tell them about the circus,
p58
aVor about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends.
p59
aVHe used a pseudonym like Bull Walker,
p60
aVor later, the Masked Marvel.
p61
aVHe even kept it a secret that same year,
p62
aVwhen he was crowned the Light Heavyweight Champion
p63
aVof the world.
p64
aa(lp65
VOver the years, John J. Bonica lived these parallel lives.
p66
aVHe was a wrestler;
p67
aVhe was a doctor.
p68
aVHe was a heel;
p69
aVhe was a hero.
p70
aVHe inflicted pain,
p71
aVand he treated it.
p72
aVAnd he didn\u2019t know it at the time, but over the next five decades,
p73
aVhe'd draw on these dueling identities
p74
aVto forge a whole new way to think about pain.
p75
aVIt'd change modern medicine so much so, that decades later,
p76
aVTime magazine would call him pain relief's founding father.
p77
aVBut that all happened later.
p78
aa(lp79
VIn 1942, Bonica graduated medical school and married Emma,
p80
aVhis sweetheart, whom he had met at one of his matches years before.
p81
aVHe still wrestled in secret \u2014 he had to.
p82
aVHis internship at New York's St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing.
p83
aVWith his championship belt, he wrestled in big-ticket venues,
p84
aVlike Madison Square Garden,
p85
aVagainst big-time opponents,
p86
aVlike Everett "The Blonde Bear" Marshall,
p87
aVor three-time world champion, Angelo Savoldi.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe matches took a toll on his body;
p90
aVhe tore hip joints, fractured ribs.
p91
aVOne night, The Terrible Turk's big toe scratched a scar like Capone's
p92
aVdown the side of his face.
p93
aVThe next morning at work, he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it.
p94
aVTwice Bonica showed up to the O.R. with one eye so bruised,
p95
aVhe couldn't see out of it.
p96
aVBut worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears.
p97
aVHe said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head.
p98
aVPain just kept accumulating in his life.
p99
aa(lp100
VNext, he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital.
p101
aVShe heaved and pushed, clearly in anguish.
p102
aVHer obstetrician called out to the intern on duty
p103
aVto give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain.
p104
aVBut the intern was a young guy, just three weeks on the job \u2014
p105
aVhe was jittery, and in applying the ether,
p106
aVirritated Emma's throat.
p107
aVShe vomited and choked, and started to turn blue.
p108
aVBonica, who was watching all this, pushed the intern out of the way,
p109
aVcleared her airway,
p110
aVand saved his wife and his unborn daughter.
p111
aVAt that moment, he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology.
p112
aVLater, he'd even go on to help develop the epidural, for delivering mothers.
p113
aVBut before he could focus on obstetrics,
p114
aVBonica had to report for basic training.
p115
aa(lp116
VRight around D-Day,
p117
aVBonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center,
p118
aVnear Tacoma.
p119
aVAt 7,700 beds, it was one of the largest army hospitals in America.
p120
aVBonica was in charge of all pain control there.
p121
aVHe was only 27.
p122
aVTreating so many patients, Bonica started noticing cases
p123
aVthat contradicted everything he had learned.
p124
aVPain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell \u2014 in a good way \u2014
p125
aVa body's way of signaling an injury, like a broken arm.
p126
aVBut in some cases,
p127
aVlike after a patient had a leg amputated,
p128
aVthat patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg.
p129
aVBut if the injury had been treated, why would the alarm bell keep ringing?
p130
aVThere were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever,
p131
aVand yet, still the patient hurt.
p132
aa(lp133
VBonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital \u2014 surgeons,
p134
aVneurologists, psychiatrists, others.
p135
aVAnd he tried to get their opinions on his patients.
p136
aVIt took too long, so he started organizing group meetings over lunch.
p137
aVIt would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient's pain.
p138
aVNo one had ever focused on pain this way before.
p139
aa(lp140
VAfter that, he hit the books.
p141
aVHe read every medical textbook he could get his hands on,
p142
aVcarefully noting every mention of the word "pain."
p143
aVOut of the 14,000 pages he read,
p144
aVthe word "pain" was on 17 and a half of them.
p145
aVSeventeen and a half.
p146
aVFor the most basic, most common, most frustrating part of being a patient.
p147
aVBonica was shocked \u2014 I'm quoting him,
p148
aVhe said, "What the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there?
p149
aVThe most important thing from the patient's perspective,
p150
aVthey don't talk about."
p151
aa(lp152
VSo over the next eight years, Bonica would talk about it.
p153
aVHe'd write about it; he'd write those missing pages.
p154
aVHe wrote what would later be known as the Bible of Pain.
p155
aVIn it he proposed new strategies,
p156
aVnew treatments using nerve-block injections.
p157
aVHe proposed a new institution, the Pain Clinic,
p158
aVbased on those lunchtime meetings.
p159
aVBut the most important thing about his book
p160
aVwas that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine.
p161
aVA desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously
p162
aVin patients' lives.
p163
aVHe recast the very purpose of medicine.
p164
aVThe goal wasn't to make patients better;
p165
aVit was to make patients feel better.
p166
aVHe pushed his pain agenda for decades,
p167
aVbefore it finally took hold in the mid-'70s.
p168
aVHundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world.
p169
aa(lp170
VBut as they did \u2014 a tragic twist.
p171
aVBonica's years of wrestling caught up to him.
p172
aVHe had been out of the ring for over 20 years,
p173
aVbut those 1,500 professional bouts had left a mark on his body.
p174
aVStill in his mid-50s, he suffered severe osteoarthritis.
p175
aVOver the next 20 years he'd have 22 surgeries,
p176
aVincluding four spine operations,
p177
aVand hip replacement after hip replacement.
p178
aVHe could barely raise his arm, turn his neck.
p179
aVHe needed aluminum crutches to walk.
p180
aVHis friends and former students became his doctors.
p181
aVOne recalled that he probably had more nerve-block injections
p182
aVthan anyone else on the planet.
p183
aVAlready a workaholic, he worked even more \u2014
p184
aV15- to 18-hour days.
p185
aVHealing others became more than just his job,
p186
aVit was his own most effective form of relief.
p187
aV"If I wasn't as busy as I am," he told a reporter at the time,
p188
aV"I would be a completely disabled guy."
p189
aa(lp190
VOn a business trip to Florida in the early 1980s,
p191
aVBonica got a former student to drive him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa.
p192
aVThey drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion,
p193
aVwith giant silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage.
p194
aVThe house belonged to the Zacchini family,
p195
aVwho were something like American circus royalty.
p196
aVDecades earlier, Bonica had watched them,
p197
aVclad in silver jumpsuits and goggles,
p198
aVdoing the act they pioneered \u2014 the Human Cannonball.
p199
aVBut now they were like him: retired.
p200
aVThat generation is all dead now, including Bonica,
p201
aVso there's no way to know exactly what they said that day.
p202
aVBut still, I love imagining it.
p203
aVThe strongman and the human cannonballs reunited,
p204
aVshowing off old scars, and new ones.
p205
aVMaybe Bonica gave them medical advice.
p206
aVMaybe he told them what he later said in an oral history,
p207
aVwhich is that his time in the circus and wrestling deeply molded his life.
p208
aa(lp209
VBonica saw pain close up.
p210
aVHe felt it. He lived it.
p211
aVAnd it made it impossible for him to ignore in others.
p212
aVOut of that empathy, he spun a whole new field,
p213
aVplayed a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain
p214
aVin and of itself.
p215
aa(lp216
VIn that same oral history,
p217
aVBonica claimed that pain
p218
aVis the most complex human experience.
p219
aVThat it involves your past life, your current life,
p220
aVyour interactions, your family.
p221
aVThat was definitely true for Bonica.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut it was also true for my mom.
p224
aVIt's easy for doctors to see my mom
p225
aVas a kind of professional patient,
p226
aVa woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms.
p227
aVSometimes I get stuck seeing her that same way.
p228
aVBut as I saw Bonica's pain \u2014
p229
aVa testament to his fully lived life \u2014
p230
aVI started to remember all the things that my mom's pain holds.
p231
aVBefore they got swollen and arthritic,
p232
aVmy mom's fingers clacked away
p233
aVin the hospital H.R. department where she worked.
p234
aVThey folded samosas for our entire mosque.
p235
aVWhen I was a kid, they cut my hair,
p236
aVwiped my nose,
p237
aVtied my shoes.
p238
aa(lp239
VThank you.

VThis room may appear
p5
aVto be holding 600 people,
p6
aVbut there's actually so many more,
p7
aVbecause in each one of us
p8
aVthere is a multitude of personalities.
p9
aVI have two primary personalities
p10
aVthat have been in conflict and conversation within me
p11
aVsince I was a little girl.
p12
aVI call them "the mystic"
p13
aVand "the warrior."
p14
aVI was born into a family
p15
aVof politically active,
p16
aVintellectual atheists.
p17
aVThere was this equation in my family that went something like this:
p18
aVif you are intelligent,
p19
aVyou therefore are not spiritual.
p20
aVI was the freak of the family.
p21
aVI was this weird little kid
p22
aVwho wanted to have deep talks
p23
aVabout the worlds that might exist
p24
aVbeyond the ones that we perceive with our senses.
p25
aVI wanted to know
p26
aVif what we human beings see
p27
aVand hear and think
p28
aVis a full and accurate picture
p29
aVof reality.
p30
aVSo, looking for answers,
p31
aVI went to Catholic mass.
p32
aVI tagged along with my neighbors.
p33
aVI read Sartre and Socrates.
p34
aVAnd then a wonderful thing happened
p35
aVwhen I was in high school:
p36
aVGurus from the East
p37
aVstarted washing up on the shores of America.
p38
aVAnd I said to myself,
p39
aV"I wanna get me one of them."
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd ever since,
p42
aVI've been walking the mystic path,
p43
aVtrying to peer beyond
p44
aVwhat Albert Einstein called
p45
aV"the optical delusion
p46
aVof everyday consciousness."
p47
aVSo what did he mean by this? I'll show you.
p48
aVTake a breath right now
p49
aVof this clear air in this room.
p50
aVNow, see this strange,
p51
aVunderwater,
p52
aVcoral reef-looking thing?
p53
aVIt's actually a person's trachea,
p54
aVand those colored globs
p55
aVare microbes
p56
aVthat are actually swimming around in this room
p57
aVright now, all around us.
p58
aVIf we're blind to this simple biology,
p59
aVimagine what we're missing
p60
aVat the smallest subatomic level right now
p61
aVand at the grandest cosmic levels.
p62
aVMy years as a mystic
p63
aVhave made me question
p64
aValmost all my assumptions.
p65
aVThey've made me a proud I-don't-know-it-all.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow when the mystic part of me
p68
aVjabbers on and on like this,
p69
aVthe warrior rolls her eyes.
p70
aVShe's concerned
p71
aVabout what's happening in this world right now.
p72
aVShe's worried.
p73
aVShe says, "Excuse me, I'm pissed off,
p74
aVand I know a few things,
p75
aVand we better get busy about them right now."
p76
aVI've spent my life as a warrior,
p77
aVworking for women's issues,
p78
aVworking on political campaigns,
p79
aVbeing an activist for the environment.
p80
aVAnd it can be sort of crazy-making,
p81
aVhousing both the mystic and the warrior
p82
aVin one body.
p83
aVI've always been attracted
p84
aVto those rare people
p85
aVwho pull that off,
p86
aVwho devote their lives to humanity
p87
aVwith the grit of the warrior
p88
aVand the grace of the mystic \u2014
p89
aVpeople like Martin Luther King, Jr.,
p90
aVwho wrote, "I can never be
p91
aVwhat I ought to be
p92
aVuntil you are
p93
aVwhat you ought to be.
p94
aVThis," he wrote, "is the interrelated structure
p95
aVof reality."
p96
aVThen Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior,
p97
aVwho said, "The problem with the world
p98
aVis that we draw the circle of our family
p99
aVtoo small."
p100
aVAnd Nelson Mandela,
p101
aVwho lives by the African concept
p102
aVof "ubuntu,"
p103
aVwhich means "I need you
p104
aVin order to be me,
p105
aVand you need me in order to be you."
p106
aVNow we all love to trot out
p107
aVthese three mystic warriors
p108
aVas if they were born
p109
aVwith the saint gene.
p110
aVBut we all actually have
p111
aVthe same capacity that they do,
p112
aVand we need to do
p113
aVtheir work now.
p114
aa(lp115
VI'm deeply disturbed
p116
aVby the ways in which all of our cultures
p117
aVare demonizing "the Other"
p118
aVby the voice we're giving
p119
aVto the most divisive among us.
p120
aVListen to these titles
p121
aVof some of the bestselling books
p122
aVfrom both sides of the political divide
p123
aVhere in the U.S.
p124
aV"Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder,"
p125
aV"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot,"
p126
aV"Pinheads and Patriots,"
p127
aV"Arguing With Idiots."
p128
aVThey're supposedly tongue-in-cheek,
p129
aVbut they're actually dangerous.
p130
aVNow here's a title that may sound familiar,
p131
aVbut whose author may surprise you:
p132
aV"Four-and-a-Half-Years of Struggle
p133
aVAgainst Lies, Stupidity
p134
aVand Cowardice."
p135
aVWho wrote that?
p136
aVThat was Adolf Hitler's first title
p137
aVfor "Mein Kampf" \u2014 "My Struggle" \u2014
p138
aVthe book that launched the Nazi party.
p139
aVThe worst eras in human history,
p140
aVwhether in Cambodia or Germany
p141
aVor Rwanda,
p142
aVthey start like this, with negative other-izing.
p143
aVAnd then they morph
p144
aVinto violent extremism.
p145
aa(lp146
VThis is why I'm launching a new initiative.
p147
aVAnd it's to help all of us,
p148
aVmyself included,
p149
aVto counteract the tendency
p150
aVto "otherize."
p151
aVAnd I realize we're all busy people,
p152
aVso don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break.
p153
aVI'm calling my initiative,
p154
aV"Take the Other to Lunch."
p155
aVIf you are
p156
aVa Republican,
p157
aVyou can take a Democrat to lunch,
p158
aVor if you're a Democrat,
p159
aVthink of it
p160
aVas taking a Republican to lunch.
p161
aVNow if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch
p162
aVmakes you lose your appetite,
p163
aVI suggest you start more local,
p164
aVbecause there is no shortage of the Other
p165
aVright in your own neighborhood.
p166
aVMaybe that person
p167
aVwho worships at the mosque,
p168
aVor the church or the synagogue, down the street.
p169
aVOr someone from the other side
p170
aVof the abortion conflict.
p171
aVOr maybe your brother-in-law
p172
aVwho doesn't believe in global warming.
p173
aVAnyone whose lifestyle may frighten you,
p174
aVor whose point of view
p175
aVmakes smoke come out of your ears.
p176
aa(lp177
VA couple of weeks ago,
p178
aVI took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch.
p179
aVNow on paper, she passed my smoking ears test.
p180
aVShe's an activist from the Right,
p181
aVand I'm an activist from the Left.
p182
aVAnd we used some guidelines
p183
aVto keep our conversation elevated,
p184
aVand you can use them too,
p185
aVbecause I know you're all going
p186
aVto take an Other to lunch.
p187
aVSo first of all, decide on a goal:
p188
aVto get to know one person
p189
aVfrom a group you may have negatively stereotyped.
p190
aVAnd then, before you get together,
p191
aVagree on some ground rules.
p192
aVMy Tea Party lunchmate and I
p193
aVcame up with these:
p194
aVdon't persuade, defend
p195
aVor interrupt.
p196
aVBe curious;
p197
aVbe conversational; be real.
p198
aVAnd listen.
p199
aa(lp200
VFrom there, we dove in.
p201
aVAnd we used these questions:
p202
aVShare some of your life experiences with me.
p203
aVWhat issues
p204
aVdeeply concern you?
p205
aVAnd what have you always wanted to ask
p206
aVsomeone from the other side?
p207
aVMy lunch partner and I
p208
aVcame away with some really important insights,
p209
aVand I'm going to share just one with you.
p210
aVI think it has relevance
p211
aVto any problem
p212
aVbetween people anywhere.
p213
aVI asked her why her side
p214
aVmakes such outrageous allegations
p215
aVand lies about my side.
p216
aV"What?" she wanted to know.
p217
aV"Like we're a bunch
p218
aVof elitist,
p219
aVmorally-corrupt terrorist-lovers."
p220
aVWell, she was shocked.
p221
aVShe thought my side
p222
aVbeat up on her side way more often,
p223
aVthat we called them brainless,
p224
aVgun-toting racists,
p225
aVand we both marveled
p226
aVat the labels that fit
p227
aVnone of the people
p228
aVwe actually know.
p229
aVAnd since we had established some trust,
p230
aVwe believed in each other's sincerity.
p231
aa(lp232
VWe agreed we'd speak up in our own communities
p233
aVwhen we witnessed
p234
aVthe kind of "otherizing" talk
p235
aVthat can wound
p236
aVand fester into paranoia
p237
aVand then be used by those on the fringes
p238
aVto incite.
p239
aVBy the end of our lunch,
p240
aVwe acknowledged each other's openness.
p241
aVNeither of us had tried to change the other.
p242
aVBut we also hadn't pretended
p243
aVthat our differences were just going to melt away
p244
aVafter a lunch.
p245
aVInstead, we had taken
p246
aVfirst steps together,
p247
aVpast our knee-jerk reactions,
p248
aVto the ubuntu place,
p249
aVwhich is the only place
p250
aVwhere solutions
p251
aVto our most intractable-seeming problems
p252
aVwill be found.
p253
aa(lp254
VWho should you invite to lunch?
p255
aVNext time you catch yourself
p256
aVin the act of otherizing,
p257
aVthat will be your clue.
p258
aVAnd what might happen at your lunch?
p259
aVWill the heavens open
p260
aVand "We Are the World" play over the restaurant sound system?
p261
aVProbably not.
p262
aVBecause ubuntu work is slow,
p263
aVand it's difficult.
p264
aVIt's two people
p265
aVdropping the pretense
p266
aVof being know-it-alls.
p267
aVIt's two people,
p268
aVtwo warriors,
p269
aVdropping their weapons
p270
aVand reaching toward each other.
p271
aVHere's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it:
p272
aV"Out beyond ideas
p273
aVof wrong-doing and right-doing,
p274
aVthere is a field.
p275
aVI'll meet you there."

bestselling author and the cofounder of Omega Institute, the renowned conference and retreat center located in Rhinebeck, New York. Lesser&#39;s first book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/uIQrQGe\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Seeker&#39;s Guide</em></a>, chronicles her years at Omega and distills lessons learned into a potent guide for growth and healing. Her <em>New York Times</em> bestselling book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/nKfE\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Broken Open: How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow</em></a>&nbsp;(Random House), has sold more than 300,000 copies and has been translated into 20 languages. Her latest book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/b3w5\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Marrow: A Love Story</em></a>&nbsp;(Harper Collins/September 2016), is a memoir about Elizabeth and her younger sister, Maggie, and the process they went through when Elizabeth was the donor for Maggie&rsquo;s bone marrow transplant.</p><p>Lesser cofounded Omega Institute in 1977 -- a time when a variety of fresh ideas were sprouting in American culture. Since then, the institute has been at the forefront of holistic education, offering workshops and trainings in: integrative medicine, prevention, nutrition, and the mind/body connection; meditation and yoga; cross-cultural arts and creativity; ecumenical spirituality; and social change movements like women&#39;s empowerment and environmental sustainability. Lesser is also the cofounder of Omega&#39;s Women&#39;s Leadership Center, which grew out of the popular Women &amp; Power conference series featuring women leaders, activists, authors and artists from around the world. Each year more than 30,000 people participate in Omega&#39;s programs on its campus in Rhinebeck, New York and at urban and travel sites, and more than a million people visit its website for online learning.</p><p>A student of the Sufi master, Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan, for many years, Lesser has also studied with spiritual teachers, healers, psychologists and philosophers from other traditions. In 2008 she helped Oprah Winfrey produce a ten-week online seminar based on Eckhart Tolle&#39;s book, <em>A New Earth</em>. The webinar was viewed by more than 8 million people worldwide. She was a frequent host on Oprah&#39;s &quot;Soul Series,&quot; a weekly radio show on Sirius/XM, and a guest on Oprah&#39;s &quot;Super Soul Sunday.&quot; In 2011, she gave a TED Talk, &quot;<a href=\\"/talks/elizabeth_lesser_take_the_other_to_lunch\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Take &#39;the Other&#39; to lunch</a> ,&quot; in which she called for civility and understanding as we negotiate our differences as human beings.</p><p>Lesser attended Barnard College, where she studied literature, and San Francisco State University, where she received a teaching degree. In 2011 she received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, in Palo Alto, California. Early in her career she was a midwife and birth educator. Today, besides writing and her work at Omega Institute, she lends her time to social and environmental causes&nbsp;and is an avid walker, cook and gardener. She lives with her family in New York&#39;s Hudson River Valley.</p>", "slug": "elizabeth_lesser", "whotheyare": "Elizabeth Lesser helps her readers and students transform their lives after brushes with pain, adversity and life\'s myriad problems.", "whatotherssay": "Broken Open is a beautifully written blend of other people\\u2019s moving stories, practical guidance and her own personal memoir.", "id": 818, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/c06fa6c3b18e13f53a7f49350c8c4fc2ed88f9a8_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Take \\"the Other\\" to lunch", "take_action": null, "comments": 865, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/9a7a7ccedd0d998c9252631b0fc01378e6bc1afc_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "There\'s an angry divisive tension in the air that threatens to make modern politics impossible.

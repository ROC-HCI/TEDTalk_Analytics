VI'm going to talk a little bit about strategy
p5
aVand its relationship with technology.
p6
aVWe tend to think of business strategy
p7
aVas being a rather abstract body
p8
aVof essentially economic thought,
p9
aVperhaps rather timeless.
p10
aVI'm going to argue that, in fact,
p11
aVbusiness strategy has always been premised
p12
aVon assumptions about technology,
p13
aVthat those assumptions are changing,
p14
aVand, in fact, changing quite dramatically,
p15
aVand that therefore what that will drive us to
p16
aVis a different concept of what we mean
p17
aVby business strategy.
p18
aa(lp19
VLet me start, if I may,
p20
aVwith a little bit of history.
p21
aVThe idea of strategy in business
p22
aVowes its origins to two intellectual giants:
p23
aVBruce Henderson, the founder of BCG,
p24
aVand Michael Porter, professor at the Harvard Business School.
p25
aVHenderson's central idea was what you might call
p26
aVthe Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass
p27
aVagainst weakness, of overwhelming the enemy.
p28
aVWhat Henderson recognized was that,
p29
aVin the business world,
p30
aVthere are many phenomena which are characterized
p31
aVby what economists would call increasing returns \u2014
p32
aVscale, experience.
p33
aVThe more you do of something,
p34
aVdisproportionately the better you get.
p35
aVAnd therefore he found a logic for investing
p36
aVin such kinds of overwhelming mass
p37
aVin order to achieve competitive advantage.
p38
aVAnd that was the first introduction
p39
aVof essentially a military concept of strategy
p40
aVinto the business world.
p41
aa(lp42
VPorter agreed with that premise,
p43
aVbut he qualified it.
p44
aVHe pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well,
p45
aVbut businesses actually have multiple steps to them.
p46
aVThey have different components,
p47
aVand each of those components might be driven
p48
aVby a different kind of strategy.
p49
aVA company or a business might actually be advantaged
p50
aVin some activities but disadvantaged in others.
p51
aVHe formed the concept of the value chain,
p52
aVessentially the sequence of steps with which
p53
aVa, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component,
p54
aVbecomes assembled into a finished product,
p55
aVand then is distributed, for example,
p56
aVand he argued that advantage accrued
p57
aVto each of those components,
p58
aVand that the advantage of the whole
p59
aVwas in some sense the sum or the average
p60
aVof that of its parts.
p61
aVAnd this idea of the value chain was predicated
p62
aVon the recognition that
p63
aVwhat holds a business together is transaction costs,
p64
aVthat in essence you need to coordinate,
p65
aVorganizations are more efficient at coordination
p66
aVthan markets, very often,
p67
aVand therefore the nature and role and boundaries
p68
aVof the cooperation are defined by transaction costs.
p69
aVIt was on those two ideas,
p70
aVHenderson's idea of increasing returns
p71
aVto scale and experience,
p72
aVand Porter's idea of the value chain,
p73
aVencompassing heterogenous elements,
p74
aVthat the whole edifice of business strategy
p75
aVwas subsequently erected.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow what I'm going to argue is
p78
aVthat those premises are, in fact, being invalidated.
p79
aVFirst of all, let's think about transaction costs.
p80
aVThere are really two components to transaction costs.
p81
aVOne is about processing information, and the other is about communication.
p82
aVThese are the economics of processing and communicating
p83
aVas they have evolved over a long period of time.
p84
aVAs we all know from so many contexts,
p85
aVthey have been radically transformed
p86
aVsince the days when Porter and Henderson
p87
aVfirst formulated their theories.
p88
aVIn particular, since the mid-'90s,
p89
aVcommunications costs have actually been falling
p90
aVeven faster than transaction costs,
p91
aVwhich is why communication, the Internet,
p92
aVhas exploded in such a dramatic fashion.
p93
aVNow, those falling transaction costs
p94
aVhave profound consequences,
p95
aVbecause if transaction costs are the glue
p96
aVthat hold value chains together, and they are falling,
p97
aVthere is less to economize on.
p98
aVThere is less need for vertically integrated organization,
p99
aVand value chains at least can break up.
p100
aVThey needn't necessarily, but they can.
p101
aVIn particular, it then becomes possible for
p102
aVa competitor in one business
p103
aVto use their position in one step of the value chain
p104
aVin order to penetrate or attack
p105
aVor disintermediate the competitor in another.
p106
aa(lp107
VThat is not just an abstract proposition.
p108
aVThere are many very specific stories
p109
aVof how that actually happened.
p110
aVA poster child example was the encyclopedia business.
p111
aVThe encyclopedia business
p112
aVin the days of leatherbound books
p113
aVwas basically a distribution business.
p114
aVMost of the cost was the commission to the salesmen.
p115
aVThe CD-ROM and then the Internet came along,
p116
aVnew technologies made the distribution of knowledge
p117
aVmany orders of magnitude cheaper,
p118
aVand the encyclopedia industry collapsed.
p119
aVIt's now, of course, a very familiar story.
p120
aVThis, in fact, more generally was the story
p121
aVof the first generation of the Internet economy.
p122
aVIt was about falling transaction costs
p123
aVbreaking up value chains
p124
aVand therefore allowing disintermediation,
p125
aVor what we call deconstruction.
p126
aa(lp127
VOne of the questions I was occasionally asked was,
p128
aVwell, what's going to replace the encyclopedia
p129
aVwhen Britannica no longer has a business model?
p130
aVAnd it was a while before the answer became manifest.
p131
aVNow, of course, we know what it is: it's the Wikipedia.
p132
aVNow what's special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution.
p133
aVWhat's special about the Wikipedia is the way it's produced.
p134
aVThe Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia
p135
aVcreated by its users.
p136
aVAnd this, in fact, defines what you might call
p137
aVthe second decade of the Internet economy,
p138
aVthe decade in which the Internet as a noun
p139
aVbecame the Internet as a verb.
p140
aVIt became a set of conversations,
p141
aVthe era in which user-generated content and social networks
p142
aVbecame the dominant phenomenon.
p143
aVNow what that really meant
p144
aVin terms of the Porter-Henderson framework
p145
aVwas the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale.
p146
aVIt turned out that tens of thousands
p147
aVof autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia
p148
aVcould do just as good a job,
p149
aVand certainly a much cheaper job,
p150
aVthan professionals in a hierarchical organization.
p151
aVSo basically what was happening was that one layer
p152
aVof this value chain was becoming fragmented,
p153
aVas individuals could take over
p154
aVwhere organizations were no longer needed.
p155
aa(lp156
VBut there's another question that obviously this graph poses,
p157
aVwhich is, okay, we've gone through two decades \u2014
p158
aVdoes anything distinguish the third?
p159
aVAnd what I'm going to argue is that indeed
p160
aVsomething does distinguish the third,
p161
aVand it maps exactly on to the kind of
p162
aVPorter-Henderson logic that we've been talking about.
p163
aVAnd that is, about data.
p164
aVIf we go back to around 2000,
p165
aVa lot of people were talking about the information revolution,
p166
aVand it was indeed true that the world's stock of data
p167
aVwas growing, indeed growing quite fast.
p168
aVbut it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog.
p169
aVWe go forward to 2007,
p170
aVnot only had the world's stock of data exploded,
p171
aVbut there'd been this massive substitution
p172
aVof digital for analog.
p173
aVAnd more important even than that,
p174
aVif you look more carefully at this graph,
p175
aVwhat you will observe is that about a half
p176
aVof that digital data
p177
aVis information that has an I.P. address.
p178
aVIt's on a server or it's on a P.C.
p179
aVBut having an I.P. address means that it
p180
aVcan be connected to any other data
p181
aVthat has an I.P. address.
p182
aVIt means it becomes possible
p183
aVto put together half of the world's knowledge
p184
aVin order to see patterns,
p185
aVan entirely new thing.
p186
aVIf we run the numbers forward to today,
p187
aVit probably looks something like this.
p188
aVWe're not really sure.
p189
aVIf we run the numbers forward to 2020,
p190
aVwe of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC.
p191
aVIt's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present.
p192
aVAnd what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication
p193
aVin the stock of information that is connected
p194
aVvia an I.P. address.
p195
aVNow, if the number of connections that we can make
p196
aVis proportional to the number of pairs of data points,
p197
aVa hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data
p198
aVis a ten-thousandfold multiplication
p199
aVin the number of patterns
p200
aVthat we can see in that data,
p201
aVthis just in the last 10 or 11 years.
p202
aVThis, I would submit, is a sea change,
p203
aVa profound change in the economics
p204
aVof the world that we live in.
p205
aa(lp206
VThe first human genome,
p207
aVthat of James Watson,
p208
aVwas mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year 2000,
p209
aVand it took about 200 million dollars
p210
aVand about 10 years of work to map
p211
aVjust one person's genomic makeup.
p212
aVSince then, the costs of mapping the genome have come down.
p213
aVIn fact, they've come down in recent years
p214
aVvery dramatically indeed,
p215
aVto the point where the cost  is now below 1,000 dollars,
p216
aVand it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015
p217
aVit will be below 100 dollars \u2014
p218
aVa five or six order of magnitude drop
p219
aVin the cost of genomic mapping
p220
aVin just a 15-year period,
p221
aVan extraordinary phenomenon.
p222
aVNow, in the days when mapping a genome
p223
aVcost millions, or even tens of thousands,
p224
aVit was basically a research enterprise.
p225
aVScientists would gather some representative people,
p226
aVand they would see patterns, and they would try
p227
aVand make generalizations about human nature and disease
p228
aVfrom the abstract patterns they find
p229
aVfrom these particular selected individuals.
p230
aVBut when the genome can  be mapped for 100 bucks,
p231
aV99 dollars while you wait,
p232
aVthen what happens is, it becomes retail.
p233
aVIt becomes above all clinical.
p234
aVYou go the doctor with a cold,
p235
aVand if he or she hasn't done it already,
p236
aVthe first thing they do is map your genome,
p237
aVat which point what they're now doing
p238
aVis not starting from some abstract  knowledge of genomic medicine
p239
aVand trying to work out how it applies to you,
p240
aVbut they're starting from your particular genome.
p241
aVNow think of the power of that.
p242
aVThink of where that takes us
p243
aVwhen we can combine genomic data
p244
aVwith clinical data
p245
aVwith data about drug interactions
p246
aVwith the kind of ambient data that devices
p247
aVlike our phone and medical sensors
p248
aVwill increasingly be collecting.
p249
aVThink what happens when we collect all of that data
p250
aVand we can put it together
p251
aVin order to find patterns we wouldn't see before.
p252
aVThis, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while,
p253
aVbut this will drive a revolution in medicine.
p254
aVFabulous, lots of people talk about this.
p255
aa(lp256
VBut there's one thing that doesn't get much attention.
p257
aVHow is that model of colossal sharing
p258
aVacross all of those kinds of databases
p259
aVcompatible with the business models
p260
aVof institutions and organizations and corporations
p261
aVthat are involved in this business today?
p262
aVIf your business is based on proprietary data,
p263
aVif your competitive advantage is defined by your data,
p264
aVhow on Earth is that company or is that society
p265
aVin fact going to achieve the value
p266
aVthat's implicit in the technology? They can't.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo essentially what's happening here,
p269
aVand genomics is merely one example of this,
p270
aVis that technology is driving
p271
aVthe natural scaling of the activity
p272
aVbeyond the institutional boundaries within which
p273
aVwe have been used to thinking about it,
p274
aVand in particular beyond the institutional boundaries
p275
aVin terms of which business strategy
p276
aVas a discipline is formulated.
p277
aVThe basic story here is that what used to be
p278
aVvertically integrated, oligopolistic competition
p279
aVamong essentially similar kinds of competitors
p280
aVis evolving, by one means or another,
p281
aVfrom a vertical structure to a horizontal one.
p282
aVWhy is that happening?
p283
aVIt's happening because transaction costs are plummeting
p284
aVand because scale is polarizing.
p285
aVThe plummeting of transaction costs
p286
aVweakens the glue that holds value chains together,
p287
aVand allows them to separate.
p288
aVThe polarization of scale economies
p289
aVtowards the very small \u2014 small is beautiful \u2014
p290
aVallows for scalable communities
p291
aVto substitute for conventional corporate production.
p292
aVThe scaling in the opposite direction,
p293
aVtowards things like big data,
p294
aVdrive the structure of business
p295
aVtowards the creation of new kinds of institutions
p296
aVthat can achieve that scale.
p297
aVBut either way, the typically vertical structure
p298
aVgets driven to becoming more horizontal.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe logic isn't just about big data.
p301
aVIf we were to look, for example, at the telecommunications industry,
p302
aVyou can tell the same story about fiber optics.
p303
aVIf we look at the pharmaceutical industry,
p304
aVor, for that matter, university research,
p305
aVyou can say exactly the same story
p306
aVabout so-called "big science."
p307
aVAnd in the opposite direction,
p308
aVif we look, say, at the energy sector,
p309
aVwhere all the talk is about how households
p310
aVwill be efficient producers of green energy
p311
aVand efficient conservers of energy,
p312
aVthat is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon.
p313
aVThat is the fragmentation of scale
p314
aVbecause the very small can substitute
p315
aVfor the traditional corporate scale.
p316
aa(lp317
VEither way, what we are driven to
p318
aVis this horizontalization of the structure of industries,
p319
aVand that implies fundamental changes
p320
aVin how we think about strategy.
p321
aVIt means, for example, that we need to think
p322
aVabout strategy as the curation
p323
aVof these kinds of horizontal structure,
p324
aVwhere things like business definition
p325
aVand even industry definition
p326
aVare actually the outcomes of strategy,
p327
aVnot something that the strategy presupposes.
p328
aVIt means, for example, we need to work out
p329
aVhow to accommodate collaboration
p330
aVand competition simultaneously.
p331
aVThink about the genome.
p332
aVWe need to accommodate the very large
p333
aVand the very small simultaneously.
p334
aVAnd we need industry structures
p335
aVthat will accommodate very, very different motivations,
p336
aVfrom the amateur motivations of people in communities
p337
aVto maybe the social motivations
p338
aVof infrastructure built by governments,
p339
aVor, for that matter, cooperative institutions
p340
aVbuilt by companies that are otherwise competing,
p341
aVbecause that is the only way that they can get to scale.
p342
aa(lp343
VThese kinds of transformations
p344
aVrender the traditional premises  of business strategy obsolete.
p345
aVThey drive us into a completely new world.
p346
aVThey require us, whether we are
p347
aVin the public sector or the private sector,
p348
aVto think very fundamentally differently
p349
aVabout the structure of business,
p350
aVand, at last, it makes strategy interesting again.
p351

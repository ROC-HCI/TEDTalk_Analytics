VIs there a real you?
p5
aVThis might seem to you  like a very odd question.
p6
aVBecause, you might ask,
p7
aVhow do we find the real you,
p8
aVhow do you know what the real you is?
p9
aVAnd so forth.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut the idea that there must be a real you,
p12
aVsurely that's obvious.
p13
aVIf there's anything real  in the world, it's you.
p14
aVWell, I'm not quite sure.
p15
aVAt least we have to understand  a bit better what that means.
p16
aVNow certainly, I think there are lots of things in our culture around us
p17
aVwhich sort of reinforce the idea
p18
aVthat for each one of us, we have a kind of a core, an essence.
p19
aVThere is something about what it means to be you which defines you,
p20
aVand it's kind of permanent and unchanging.
p21
aVThe most kind of crude way in which we have it,
p22
aVare things like horoscopes.
p23
aVYou know, people are very wedded to these, actually.
p24
aVPeople put them on their Facebook profile
p25
aVas though they are meaningul,
p26
aVyou even know  your Chinese horoscope as well.
p27
aVThere are also  more scientific versions of this,
p28
aVall sorts of ways of profiling personality type,
p29
aVsuch as the Myers-Briggs tests, for example.
p30
aVI don't know if you've done those.
p31
aVA lot of companies  use these for recruitment.
p32
aVYou answer a lot of questions,
p33
aVand this is supposed to reveal something about your core personality.
p34
aVAnd of course, the popular fascination  with this is enormous.
p35
aVIn magazines like this, you'll see,
p36
aVin the bottom left corner, they'll advertise in virtually every issue
p37
aVsome kind of personality thing.
p38
aVAnd if you pick up one of those magazines,
p39
aVit's hard to resist, isn't it?
p40
aVDoing the test to find what is your learning style,
p41
aVwhat is your loving style, or what is your working style?
p42
aVAre you this kind of person or that?
p43
aa(lp44
VSo I think that we have a common-sense idea
p45
aVthat there is a kind of core  or essence of ourselves
p46
aVto be discovered.
p47
aVAnd that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves,
p48
aVsomething that's the same throughout life.
p49
aVWell, that's the idea I want to challenge.
p50
aVAnd I have to say now, I'll say it a bit later,
p51
aVbut I'm not challenging this just because I'm weird,
p52
aVthe challenge actually has a very, very long and distinguished history.
p53
aVHere's the common-sense idea.
p54
aVThere is you.
p55
aVYou are the individuals you are, and you have this kind of core.
p56
aVNow in your life, what happens is that you, of course,
p57
aVaccumulate different experiences and so forth.
p58
aVSo you have memories,
p59
aVand these memories help  to create what you are.
p60
aVYou have desires, maybe for a cookie,
p61
aVmaybe for something that we don't want to talk about
p62
aVat 11 o'clock in the morning in a school.
p63
aVYou will have beliefs.
p64
aVThis is a number plate from someone in America.
p65
aVI don't know whether this number plate, which says "messiah 1,"
p66
aVindicates that the driver believes in the messiah,
p67
aVor that they are the messiah.
p68
aVEither way, they have beliefs  about messiahs.
p69
aVWe have knowledge.
p70
aVWe have sensations and experiences as well.
p71
aVIt's not just intellectual things.
p72
aVSo this is kind of  the common-sense model, I think,
p73
aVof what a person is.
p74
aVThere is a person who has all the things that make up our life experiences.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut the suggestion  I want to put to you today
p77
aVis that there's something  fundamentally wrong with this model.
p78
aVAnd I can show you what's wrong with one click.
p79
aVWhich is there isn't actually a "you" at the heart of all these experiences.
p80
aVStrange thought? Well, maybe not.
p81
aVWhat is there, then?
p82
aVWell, clearly there are memories, desires, intentions, sensations,
p83
aVand so forth.
p84
aVBut what happens is these things exist,
p85
aVand they're kind of all integrated,
p86
aVthey're overlapped, they're connected in various different ways.
p87
aVThey're connecting partly, and perhaps even mainly,
p88
aVbecause they all belong to one body and one brain.
p89
aVBut there's also a narrative,  a story we tell about ourselves,
p90
aVthe experiences we have when we remember past things.
p91
aVWe do things because of other things.
p92
aVSo what we desire is partly a result of what we believe,
p93
aVand what we remember is also informing us what we know.
p94
aVAnd so really, there are all these things,
p95
aVlike beliefs, desires,  sensations, experiences,
p96
aVthey're all related to each other,
p97
aVand that just is you.
p98
aVIn some ways, it's a small difference from the common-sense understanding.
p99
aVIn some ways, it's a massive one.
p100
aa(lp101
VIt's the shift between thinking of yourself
p102
aVas a thing which has  all the experiences of life,
p103
aVand thinking of yourself as simply that collection
p104
aVof all experiences in life.
p105
aVYou are the sum of your parts.
p106
aVNow those parts are also physical parts,  of course,
p107
aVbrains, bodies and legs and things,
p108
aVbut they aren't so important, actually.
p109
aVIf you have a heart transplant, you're still the same person.
p110
aVIf you have a memory transplant, are you the same person?
p111
aVIf you have a belief transplant,  would you be the same person?
p112
aVNow this idea, that what we are,  the way to understand ourselves,
p113
aVis as not of some permanent being, which has experiences,
p114
aVbut is kind of a collection of experiences,
p115
aVmight strike you as kind of weird.
p116
aa(lp117
VBut actually, I don't think  it should be weird.
p118
aVIn a way, it's common sense.
p119
aVBecause I just invite you  to think about, by comparison,
p120
aVthink about pretty much anything else in the universe,
p121
aVmaybe apart from the  very most fundamental forces or powers.
p122
aVLet's take something like water.
p123
aVNow my science isn't very good.
p124
aVWe might say something like  water has two parts hydrogen
p125
aVand one parts oxygen, right?
p126
aVWe all know that.
p127
aVI hope no one in this room thinks that what that means
p128
aVis there is a thing called water,  and attached to it
p129
aVare hydrogen and oxygen atoms,
p130
aVand that's what water is.
p131
aVOf course we don't.
p132
aVWe understand, very easily, very straightforwardly,
p133
aVthat water is nothing more
p134
aVthan the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged.
p135
aVEverything else in the universe is the same.
p136
aVThere's no mystery about my watch, for example.
p137
aVWe say the watch has a face, and hands,
p138
aVand a mechanism and a battery,
p139
aVBut what we really mean is,
p140
aVwe don't think  there is a thing called the watch
p141
aVto which we then attach all these bits.
p142
aVWe understand very clearly  that you get the parts of the watch,
p143
aVyou put them together, and you create a watch.
p144
aVNow if everything else  in the universe is like this,
p145
aVwhy are we different?
p146
aa(lp147
VWhy think of ourselves
p148
aVas somehow not just being  a collection of all our parts,
p149
aVbut somehow being a separate, permanent entity which has those parts?
p150
aVNow this view is not particularly new,  actually.
p151
aVIt has quite a long lineage.
p152
aVYou find it in Buddhism,
p153
aVyou find it in 17th,  18th-century philosophy
p154
aVgoing through to the current day, people like Locke and Hume.
p155
aVBut interestingly, it's also a view
p156
aVincreasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience.
p157
aVThis is Paul Broks,  he's a clinical neuropsychologist,
p158
aVand he says this:
p159
aV"We have a deep intuition that there is a core,
p160
aVan essence there,  and it's hard to shake off,
p161
aVprobably impossible to shake off,  I suspect.
p162
aVBut it's true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain
p163
aVwhere things do all come together."
p164
aVSo when you look at the brain,
p165
aVand you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self,
p166
aVyou find that there isn't  a central control spot in the brain.
p167
aVThere is no kind of center where everything happens.
p168
aVThere are lots of different processes in the brain,
p169
aVall of which operate, in a way, quite independently.
p170
aVBut it's because of the way  that they relate
p171
aVthat we get this sense of self.
p172
aVThe term I use in the book,  I call it the ego trick.
p173
aVIt's like a mechanical trick.
p174
aVIt's not that we don't exist,
p175
aVit's just that the trick is  to make us feel that inside of us
p176
aVis something more unified than is really there.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow you might think this is a worrying idea.
p179
aVYou might think that if it's true,
p180
aVthat for each one of us there is no abiding core of self,
p181
aVno permanent essence,
p182
aVdoes that mean that really, the self is an illusion?
p183
aVDoes it mean that we really don't exist?
p184
aVThere is no real you.
p185
aVWell, a lot of people actually do use  this talk of illusion and so forth.
p186
aVThese are three psychologists, Thomas Metzinger, Bruce Hood,
p187
aVSusan Blackmore,
p188
aVa lot of these people do talk  the language of illusion,
p189
aVthe self is an illusion, it's a fiction.
p190
aVBut I don't think this is  a very helpful way of looking at it.
p191
aVGo back to the watch.
p192
aVThe watch isn't an illusion,  because there is nothing to the watch
p193
aVother than a collection of its parts.
p194
aVIn the same way,  we're not illusions either.
p195
aVThe fact that we are, in some ways, just this very, very complex collection,
p196
aVordered collection of things,
p197
aVdoes not mean we're not real.
p198
aVI can give you  a very sort of rough metaphor for this.
p199
aVLet's take something like a waterfall.
p200
aVThese are the Iguazu Falls, in Argentina.
p201
aVNow if you take something like this,
p202
aVyou can appreciate the fact  that in lots of ways,
p203
aVthere's nothing permanent about this.
p204
aVFor one thing, it's always changing.
p205
aVThe waters  are always carving new channels.
p206
aVwith changes and tides and the weather,
p207
aVsome things dry up,  new things are created.
p208
aVOf course the water that flows  through the waterfall
p209
aVis different every single instance.
p210
aVBut it doesn't mean that  the Iguazu Falls are an illusion.
p211
aVIt doesn't mean it's not real.
p212
aVWhat it means is we have  to understand what it is
p213
aVas something which has a history,
p214
aVhas certain things that keep it together,
p215
aVbut it's a process, it's fluid,  it's forever changing.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow that, I think, is a model for understanding ourselves,
p218
aVand I think it's a liberating model.
p219
aVBecause if you think that you have this fixed, permanent essence,
p220
aVwhich is always the same, throughout your life, no matter what,
p221
aVin a sense you're kind of trapped.
p222
aVYou're born with an essence,
p223
aVthat's what you are until you die,
p224
aVif you believe in an afterlife,  maybe you continue.
p225
aVBut if you think of yourself as being, in a way,
p226
aVnot a thing as such,  but a kind of a process,
p227
aVsomething that is changing,
p228
aVthen I think that's quite liberating.
p229
aVBecause unlike the the waterfalls,
p230
aVwe actually have the capacity to channel
p231
aVthe direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree.
p232
aVNow we've got to be careful here, right?
p233
aVIf you watch the X-Factor too much, you might buy into this idea
p234
aVthat we can all be whatever we want to be.
p235
aVThat's not true.
p236
aVI've heard some fantastic musicians this morning,
p237
aVand I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them.
p238
aVI could practice hard  and maybe be good,
p239
aVbut I don't have that really natural ability.
p240
aVThere are limits to what we can achieve.
p241
aVThere are limits to what  we can make of ourselves.
p242
aVBut nevertheless, we do have  this capacity
p243
aVto, in a sense, shape ourselves.
p244
aVThe true self, as it were then,
p245
aVis not something that is just there for you to discover,
p246
aVyou don't sort of look into your soul and find your true self,
p247
aVWhat you are partly doing, at least,
p248
aVis actually creating your true self.
p249
aVAnd this, I think, is very, very significant,
p250
aVparticularly at this stage of life you're at.
p251
aVYou'll be aware of the fact
p252
aVhow much of you changed over recent years.
p253
aVIf you have any videos of yourself,  three or four years ago,
p254
aVyou probably feel embarrassed  because you don't recognize yourself.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo I want to get that message over, that what we need to do
p257
aVis think about ourselves as things that we can shape,
p258
aVand channel and change.
p259
aVThis is the Buddha, again:
p260
aV"Well-makers lead the water,
p261
aVfletchers bend the arrow,
p262
aVcarpenters bend a log of wood,
p263
aVwise people fashion themselves."
p264
aVAnd that's the idea  I want to leave you with,
p265
aVthat your true self is not something  that you will have to go searching for,
p266
aVas a mystery, and maybe never ever find.
p267
aVTo the extent you have a true self,
p268
aVit's something that you in part discover,
p269
aVbut in part create.
p270
aVand that, I think,  is a liberating and exciting prospect.
p271
aVThank you very much.

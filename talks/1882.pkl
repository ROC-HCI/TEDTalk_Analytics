VWe have a global health challenge
p5
aVin our hands today,
p6
aVand that is that the way we currently
p7
aVdiscover and develop new drugs
p8
aVis too costly, takes far too long,
p9
aVand it fails more often than it succeeds.
p10
aVIt really just isn't working, and that means
p11
aVthat patients that badly need new therapies
p12
aVare not getting them,
p13
aVand diseases are going untreated.
p14
aVWe seem to be spending more and more money.
p15
aVSo for every billion dollars we spend in R&D,
p16
aVwe're getting less drugs approved into the market.
p17
aVMore money, less drugs. Hmm.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo what's going on here?
p20
aVWell, there's a multitude of factors at play,
p21
aVbut I think one of the key factors
p22
aVis that the tools that we currently have
p23
aVavailable to test whether a drug is going to work,
p24
aVwhether it has efficacy,
p25
aVor whether it's going to be safe
p26
aVbefore we get it into human clinical trials,
p27
aVare failing us. They're not predicting
p28
aVwhat's going to happen in humans.
p29
aVAnd we have two main tools available
p30
aVat our disposal.
p31
aVThey are cells in dishes and animal testing.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes.
p34
aVSo, cells are happily functioning in our bodies.
p35
aVWe take them and rip them out
p36
aVof their native environment, throw them in one of these dishes,
p37
aVand expect them to work.
p38
aVGuess what. They don't.
p39
aVThey don't like that environment
p40
aVbecause it's nothing like
p41
aVwhat they have in the body.
p42
aa(lp43
VWhat about animal testing?
p44
aVWell, animals do and can provide
p45
aVextremely useful information.
p46
aVThey teach us about what happens
p47
aVin the complex organism.
p48
aVWe learn more about the biology itself.
p49
aVHowever, more often than not,
p50
aVanimal models fail to predict what will happen in humans
p51
aVwhen they're treated with a particular drug.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo we need better tools.
p54
aVWe need human cells,
p55
aVbut we need to find a way to keep them happy
p56
aVoutside the body.
p57
aa(lp58
VOur bodies are dynamic environments.
p59
aVWe're in constant motion.
p60
aVOur cells experience that.
p61
aVThey're in dynamic environments in our body.
p62
aVThey're under constant mechanical forces.
p63
aVSo if we want to make cells happy
p64
aVoutside our bodies,
p65
aVwe need to become cell architects.
p66
aVWe need to design, build and engineer
p67
aVa home away from home for the cells.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd at the Wyss Institute,
p70
aVwe've done just that.
p71
aVWe call it an organ-on-a-chip.
p72
aVAnd I have one right here.
p73
aVIt's beautiful, isn't it? But it's pretty incredible.
p74
aVRight here in my hand is a breathing, living
p75
aVhuman lung on a chip.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd it's not just beautiful.
p78
aVIt can do a tremendous amount of things.
p79
aVWe have living cells in that little chip,
p80
aVcells that are in a dynamic environment
p81
aVinteracting with different cell types.
p82
aVThere's been many people
p83
aVtrying to grow cells in the lab.
p84
aVThey've tried many different approaches.
p85
aVThey've even tried to grow little mini-organs in the lab.
p86
aVWe're not trying to do that here.
p87
aVWe're simply trying to recreate
p88
aVin this tiny chip
p89
aVthe smallest functional unit
p90
aVthat represents the biochemistry,
p91
aVthe function and the mechanical strain
p92
aVthat the cells experience in our bodies.
p93
aVSo how does it work? Let me show you.
p94
aVWe use techniques from the computer chip
p95
aVmanufacturing industry
p96
aVto make these structures at a scale
p97
aVrelevant to both the cells and their environment.
p98
aVWe have three fluidic channels.
p99
aVIn the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane
p100
aVon which we can add human cells
p101
aVfrom, say, our lungs,
p102
aVand then underneath, they had capillary cells,
p103
aVthe cells in our blood vessels.
p104
aVAnd we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip
p105
aVthat stretch and contract the membrane,
p106
aVso the cells experience the same mechanical forces
p107
aVthat they did when we breathe.
p108
aVAnd they experience them how they did in the body.
p109
aVThere's air flowing through the top channel,
p110
aVand then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients
p111
aVthrough the blood channel.
p112
aVNow the chip is really beautiful,
p113
aVbut what can we do with it?
p114
aVWe can get incredible functionality
p115
aVinside these little chips.
p116
aVLet me show you.
p117
aVWe could, for example, mimic infection,
p118
aVwhere we add bacterial cells into the lung.
p119
aVthen we can add human white blood cells.
p120
aVWhite blood cells are our body's defense
p121
aVagainst bacterial invaders,
p122
aVand when they sense this inflammation due to infection,
p123
aVthey will enter from the blood into the lung
p124
aVand engulf the bacteria.
p125
aVWell now you're going to see this happening
p126
aVlive in an actual human lung on a chip.
p127
aVWe've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through,
p128
aVand when they detect that infection,
p129
aVthey begin to stick.
p130
aVThey stick, and then they try to go into the lung
p131
aVside from blood channel.
p132
aVAnd you can see here, we can actually visualize
p133
aVa single white blood cell.
p134
aVIt sticks, it wiggles its way through
p135
aVbetween the cell layers, through the pore,
p136
aVcomes out on the other side of the membrane,
p137
aVand right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria
p138
aVlabeled in green.
p139
aVIn that tiny chip, you just witnessed
p140
aVone of the most fundamental responses
p141
aVour body has to an infection.
p142
aVIt's the way we respond to \u2014 an immune response.
p143
aVIt's pretty exciting.
p144
aa(lp145
VNow I want to share this picture with you,
p146
aVnot just because it's so beautiful,
p147
aVbut because it tells us an enormous amount of information
p148
aVabout what the cells are doing within the chips.
p149
aVIt tells us that these cells
p150
aVfrom the small airways in our lungs,
p151
aVactually have these hairlike structures
p152
aVthat you would expect to see in the lung.
p153
aVThese structures are called cilia,
p154
aVand they actually move the mucus out of the lung.
p155
aVYeah. Mucus. Yuck.
p156
aVBut mucus is actually very important.
p157
aVMucus traps particulates, viruses,
p158
aVpotential allergens,
p159
aVand these little cilia move
p160
aVand clear the mucus out.
p161
aVWhen they get damaged, say,
p162
aVby cigarette smoke for example,
p163
aVthey don't work properly, and they can't clear that mucus out.
p164
aVAnd that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis.
p165
aVCilia and the clearance of mucus
p166
aVare also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis.
p167
aVBut now, with the functionality that we get in these chips,
p168
aVwe can begin to look
p169
aVfor potential new treatments.
p170
aa(lp171
VWe didn't stop with the lung on a chip.
p172
aVWe have a gut on a chip.
p173
aVYou can see one right here.
p174
aVAnd we've put intestinal human cells
p175
aVin a gut on a chip,
p176
aVand they're under constant peristaltic motion,
p177
aVthis trickling flow through the cells,
p178
aVand we can mimic many of the functions
p179
aVthat you actually would expect to see
p180
aVin the human intestine.
p181
aVNow we can begin to create models of diseases
p182
aVsuch as irritable bowel syndrome.
p183
aVThis is a disease that affects
p184
aVa large number of individuals.
p185
aVIt's really debilitating,
p186
aVand there aren't really many good treatments for it.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow we have a whole pipeline
p189
aVof different organ chips
p190
aVthat we are currently working on in our labs.
p191
aVNow, the true power of this technology, however,
p192
aVreally comes from the fact
p193
aVthat we can fluidically link them.
p194
aVThere's fluid flowing across these cells,
p195
aVso we can begin to interconnect
p196
aVmultiple different chips together
p197
aVto form what we call a virtual human on a chip.
p198
aVNow we're really getting excited.
p199
aVWe're not going to ever recreate  a whole human in these chips,
p200
aVbut what our goal is is to be able to recreate
p201
aVsufficient functionality
p202
aVso that we can make better predictions
p203
aVof what's going to happen in humans.
p204
aVFor example, now we can begin to explore
p205
aVwhat happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug.
p206
aVThose of you like me who have asthma, when you take your inhaler,
p207
aVwe can explore how that drug comes into your lungs,
p208
aVhow it enters the body,
p209
aVhow it might affect, say, your heart.
p210
aVDoes it change the beating of your heart?
p211
aVDoes it have a toxicity?
p212
aVDoes it get cleared by the liver?
p213
aVIs it metabolized in the liver?
p214
aVIs it excreted in your kidneys?
p215
aVWe can begin to study the dynamic
p216
aVresponse of the body to a drug.
p217
aa(lp218
VThis could really revolutionize
p219
aVand be a game changer
p220
aVfor not only the pharmaceutical industry,
p221
aVbut a whole host of different industries,
p222
aVincluding the cosmetics industry.
p223
aVWe can potentially use the skin on a chip
p224
aVthat we're currently developing in the lab
p225
aVto test whether the ingredients in those products
p226
aVthat you're using are actually  safe to put on your skin
p227
aVwithout the need for animal testing.
p228
aVWe could test the safety
p229
aVof chemicals that we are exposed to
p230
aVon a daily basis in our environment,
p231
aVsuch as chemicals in regular household cleaners.
p232
aVWe could also use the organs on chips
p233
aVfor applications in bioterrorism
p234
aVor radiation exposure.
p235
aVWe could use them to learn more about
p236
aVdiseases such as ebola
p237
aVor other deadly diseases such as SARS.
p238
aa(lp239
VOrgans on chips could also change
p240
aVthe way we do clinical trials in the future.
p241
aVRight now, the average participant
p242
aVin a clinical trial is that: average.
p243
aVTends to be middle aged, tends to be female.
p244
aVYou won't find many clinical trials
p245
aVin which children are involved,
p246
aVyet every day, we give children medications,
p247
aVand the only safety data we have on that drug
p248
aVis one that we obtained from adults.
p249
aVChildren are not adults.
p250
aVThey may not respond in the same way adults do.
p251
aVThere are other things like genetic differences
p252
aVin populations
p253
aVthat may lead to at-risk populations
p254
aVthat are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction.
p255
aVNow imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations,
p256
aVput them on chips,
p257
aVand create populations on a chip.
p258
aVThis could really change the way
p259
aVwe do clinical trials.
p260
aVAnd this is the team and the people that are doing this.
p261
aVWe have engineers, we have cell biologists,
p262
aVwe have clinicians, all working together.
p263
aVWe're really seeing something quite incredible
p264
aVat the Wyss Institute.
p265
aVIt's really a convergence of disciplines,
p266
aVwhere biology is influencing the way we design,
p267
aVthe way we engineer, the way we build.
p268
aVIt's pretty exciting.
p269
aa(lp270
VWe're establishing important industry collaborations
p271
aVsuch as the one we have with a company
p272
aVthat has expertise in large-scale digital manufacturing.
p273
aVThey're going to help us make,
p274
aVinstead of one of these,
p275
aVmillions of these chips,
p276
aVso that we can get them into the hands
p277
aVof as many researchers as possible.
p278
aVAnd this is key to the potential of that technology.
p279
aa(lp280
VNow let me show you our instrument.
p281
aVThis is an instrument that our engineers
p282
aVare actually prototyping right now in the lab,
p283
aVand this instrument is going to give us
p284
aVthe engineering controls that we're going to require
p285
aVin order to link 10 or more organ chips together.
p286
aVIt does something else that's very important.
p287
aVIt creates an easy user interface.
p288
aVSo a cell biologist like me can come in,
p289
aVtake a chip, put it in a cartridge
p290
aVlike the prototype you see there,
p291
aVput the cartridge into the machine
p292
aVjust like you would a C.D.,
p293
aVand away you go.
p294
aVPlug and play. Easy.
p295
aa(lp296
VNow, let's imagine a little bit
p297
aVwhat the future might look like
p298
aVif I could take your stem cells
p299
aVand put them on a chip,
p300
aVor your stem cells and put them on a chip.
p301
aVIt would be a personalized chip just for you.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow all of us in here are individuals,
p304
aVand those individual differences mean
p305
aVthat we could react very differently
p306
aVand sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs.
p307
aVI myself, a couple of years back, had a really bad headache,
p308
aVjust couldn't shake it, thought,  "Well, I'll try something different."
p309
aVI took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later,
p310
aVI was on my way to the emergency room
p311
aVwith a full-blown asthma attack.
p312
aVNow, obviously it wasn't fatal,
p313
aVbut unfortunately, some of these
p314
aVadverse drug reactions can be fatal.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo how do we prevent them?
p317
aVWell, we could imagine one day
p318
aVhaving Geraldine on a chip,
p319
aVhaving Danielle on a chip,
p320
aVhaving you on a chip.
p321
aa(lp322
VPersonalized medicine. Thank you.

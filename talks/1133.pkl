VI thought I'd talk a little bit about how nature makes materials.
p5
aVI brought along with me an abalone shell.
p6
aVThis abalone shell is a biocomposite material
p7
aVthat's 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate
p8
aVand two percent by mass protein.
p9
aVYet, it's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart.
p10
aVAnd a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells,
p11
aVlike chalk.
p12
aVI've been fascinated by how nature makes materials,
p13
aVand there's a lot of secrets to how they do such an exquisite job.
p14
aVPart of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure,
p15
aVbut they're formed at the nano scale.
p16
aVThey're formed at the nano scale,
p17
aVand they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level
p18
aVthat allow them to build these really exquisite structures.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo something I think is very fascinating is:
p21
aVWhat if you could give life to non-living structures,
p22
aVlike batteries and like solar cells?
p23
aVWhat if they had some of the same capabilities
p24
aVthat an abalone shell did,
p25
aVin terms of being able to build really exquisite structures
p26
aVat room temperature and room pressure,
p27
aVusing nontoxic chemicals
p28
aVand adding no toxic materials back into the environment?
p29
aVSo that's kind of the vision that I've been thinking about.
p30
aVAnd so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish?
p31
aVOr what if you could give genetic information to a battery
p32
aVso that it could actually become better as a function of time, and do so
p33
aVin an environmentally friendly way?
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd so, going back to this abalone shell,
p36
aVbesides being nanostructured, one thing that's fascinating is,
p37
aVwhen a male and female abalone get together,
p38
aVthey pass on the genetic information that says,
p39
aV"This is how to build an exquisite material.
p40
aVHere's how to do it at room temperature and pressure,
p41
aVusing nontoxic materials."
p42
aVSame with diatoms, which are shown right here,
p43
aVwhich are glasseous structures.
p44
aVEvery time the diatoms replicate,
p45
aVthey give the genetic information that says,
p46
aV"Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nanostructured."
p47
aVAnd you can do it the same, over and over again."
p48
aVSo what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery?
p49
aVI like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut anyone who's ever had or knows small children knows,
p52
aVthey're incredibly complex organisms.
p53
aVIf you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do,
p54
aVit's very difficult.
p55
aVSo when we think about future technologies,
p56
aVwe actually think of using bacteria and viruses \u2014
p57
aVsimple organisms.
p58
aVCan you convince them to work with a new toolbox,
p59
aVso they can build a structure that will be important to me?
p60
aa(lp61
VAlso, when we think about future technologies,
p62
aVwe start with the beginning of Earth.
p63
aVBasically, it took a billion years to have life on Earth.
p64
aVAnd very rapidly, they became multi-cellular,
p65
aVthey could replicate, they could use photosynthesis
p66
aVas a way of getting their energy source.
p67
aVBut it wasn't until about 500 million years ago \u2014
p68
aVduring the Cambrian geologic time period \u2014
p69
aVthat organisms in the ocean started making hard materials.
p70
aVBefore that, they were all soft, fluffy structures.
p71
aVIt was during this time that there was increased calcium,
p72
aViron and silicon in the environment,
p73
aVand organisms learned how to make hard materials.
p74
aVSo that's what I would like to be able to do,
p75
aVconvince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow, if you look at biology,
p78
aVthere's many structures like DNA, antibodies, proteins and ribosomes
p79
aVyou've heard about,
p80
aVthat are nanostructured \u2014
p81
aVnature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nano scale.
p82
aVWhat if we could harness them
p83
aVand convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV?
p84
aVWhat if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us?
p85
aVHere are some examples.
p86
aVNatural shells, natural biological materials.
p87
aVThe abalone shell here.
p88
aVIf you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nanostructured.
p89
aVThere's diatoms made out of SiO2,
p90
aVand there are magnetotactic bacteria
p91
aVthat make small, single-domain magnets used for navigation.
p92
aVWhat all these have in common
p93
aVis these materials are structured at the nano scale,
p94
aVand they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence
p95
aVthat gives them the blueprint
p96
aVto be able to build these really wonderful structures.
p97
aVNow, going back to the abalone shell,
p98
aVthe abalone makes this shell by having these proteins.
p99
aVThese proteins are very negatively charged.
p100
aVThey can pull calcium out of the environment,
p101
aVand put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.
p102
aVIt has the chemical sequences of amino acids which says,
p103
aV"This is how to build the structure.
p104
aVHere's the DNA sequence, here's the protein sequence
p105
aVin order to do it."
p106
aVSo an interesting idea is,
p107
aVwhat if you could take any material you wanted,
p108
aVor any element on the periodic table,
p109
aVand find its corresponding DNA sequence,
p110
aVthen code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure,
p111
aVbut not build an abalone shell \u2014
p112
aVbuild something that nature has never had the opportunity to work with yet.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd so here's the periodic table.
p115
aVI absolutely love the periodic table.
p116
aVEvery year for the incoming freshman class at MIT,
p117
aVI have a periodic table made that says,
p118
aV"Welcome to MIT. Now you're in your element."
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd you flip it over, and it's the amino acids
p123
aVwith the pH at which they have different charges.
p124
aVAnd so I give this out to thousands of people.
p125
aVAnd I know it says MIT and this is Caltech,
p126
aVbut I have a couple extra if people want it.
p127
aVI was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year
p128
aVon his visit to MIT,
p129
aVand I really wanted to give him a periodic table.
p130
aVSo I stayed up at night and talked to my husband,
p131
aV"How do I give President Obama a periodic table?
p132
aVWhat if he says, 'Oh, I already have one,'
p133
aVor, 'I've already memorized it?'"
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VSo he came to visit my lab and looked around \u2014 it was a great visit.
p138
aVAnd then afterward, I said,
p139
aV"Sir, I want to give you the periodic table,
p140
aVin case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight."
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VI thought "molecular weight" sounded much less nerdy than "molar mass."
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd he looked at it and said,
p149
aV"Thank you. I'll look at it periodically."
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
V(Applause)
p154
aa(lp155
VLater in a lecture that he gave on clean energy,
p156
aVhe pulled it out and said,
p157
aV"And people at MIT, they give out periodic tables." So ...
p158
aa(lp159
VSo basically what I didn't tell you
p160
aVis that about 500 million years ago, the organisms started making materials,
p161
aVbut it took them about 50 million years to get good at it \u2014
p162
aV50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell.
p163
aVAnd that's a hard sell to a graduate student:
p164
aV"I have this great project ... 50 million years ..."
p165
aVSo we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly.
p166
aVAnd so we use a nontoxic virus called M13 bacteriophage,
p167
aVwhose job is to infect bacteria.
p168
aVWell, it has a simple DNA structure
p169
aVthat you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it,
p170
aVand by doing that, it allows the virus to express random protein sequences.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis is pretty easy biotechnology,
p173
aVand you could basically do this a billion times.
p174
aVSo you can have a billion different viruses
p175
aVthat are all genetically identical,
p176
aVbut they differ from each other based on their tips,
p177
aVon one sequence,
p178
aVthat codes for one protein.
p179
aVNow if you take all billion viruses, and put them in one drop of liquid,
p180
aVyou can force them to interact with anything you want
p181
aVon the periodic table.
p182
aVAnd through a process of selection evolution,
p183
aVyou can pull one of a billion that does something you'd like it to do,
p184
aVlike grow a battery or a solar cell.
p185
aa(lp186
VBasically, viruses can't replicate themselves; they need a host.
p187
aVOnce you find that one out of a billion,
p188
aVyou infect it into a bacteria, and make millions and billions of copies
p189
aVof that particular sequence.
p190
aVThe other thing that's beautiful about biology
p191
aVis that biology gives you really exquisite structures
p192
aVwith nice link scales.
p193
aVThese viruses are long and skinny,
p194
aVand we can get them to express the ability
p195
aVto grow something like semiconductors
p196
aVor materials for batteries.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab.
p199
aVWe engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes.
p200
aVOne part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube,
p201
aVthe other part of the virus has a sequence
p202
aVthat can grow an electrode material for a battery,
p203
aVand then it wires itself to the current collector.
p204
aVAnd so through a process of selection evolution,
p205
aVwe went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery
p206
aVto a virus that made a good battery
p207
aVto a virus that made a record-breaking, high-powered battery
p208
aVthat's all made at room temperature, basically at the benchtop.
p209
aVThat battery went to the White House for a press conference,
p210
aVand I brought it here.
p211
aVYou can see it in this case that's lighting this LED.
p212
aVNow if we could scale this,
p213
aVyou could actually use it to run your Prius,
p214
aVwhich is kind of my dream \u2014 to be able to drive a virus-powered car.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VBut basically you can pull one out of a billion,
p219
aVand make lots of amplifications to it.
p220
aVBasically, you make an amplification in the lab,
p221
aVand then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery.
p222
aVWe're able to do this also with catalysis.
p223
aVThis is the example of a photocatalytic splitting of water.
p224
aVAnd what we've been able to do is engineer a virus
p225
aVto basically take dye-absorbing molecules
p226
aVand line them up on the surface of the virus
p227
aVso it acts as an antenna,
p228
aVand you get an energy transfer across the virus.
p229
aVAnd then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material
p230
aVthat can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen,
p231
aVthat can be used for clean fuels.
p232
aVI brought an example of that with me today.
p233
aVMy students promised me it would work.
p234
aVThese are virus-assembled nanowires.
p235
aVWhen you shine light on them, you can see them bubbling.
p236
aVIn this case, you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VBasically, by controlling the genes,
p241
aVyou can control multiple materials to improve your device performance.
p242
aa(lp243
VThe last example are solar cells.
p244
aVYou can also do this with solar cells.
p245
aVWe've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes
p246
aVand then grow titanium dioxide around them,
p247
aVand use it as a way of getting electrons through the device.
p248
aVAnd what we've found is through genetic engineering,
p249
aVwe can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells
p250
aVto record numbers
p251
aVfor these types of dye-sensitized systems.
p252
aVAnd I brought one of those as well,
p253
aVthat you can play around with outside afterward.
p254
aVSo this is a virus-based solar cell.
p255
aVThrough evolution and selection,
p256
aVwe took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell
p257
aVto an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo I hope that I've convinced you
p260
aVthat there's a lot of great, interesting things to be learned
p261
aVabout how nature makes materials,
p262
aVand about taking it the next step,
p263
aVto see if you can force or take advantage of how nature makes materials,
p264
aVto make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making.
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)

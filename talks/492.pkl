VIf you're at all like me,
p5
aVthis is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco:
p6
aVyou build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils
p7
aVcapable of more than 30 knots.
p8
aVAnd you realize that there is incredible power in the wind,
p9
aVand it can do amazing things.
p10
aVAnd one day, a vessel not unlike this
p11
aVwill probably break the world speed record.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut kites aren't just toys like this.
p14
aVKites: I'm going to give you a brief history,
p15
aVand tell you about the magnificent future
p16
aVof every child's favorite plaything.
p17
aVSo, kites are more than a thousand years old,
p18
aVand the Chinese used them for military applications,
p19
aVand even for lifting men.
p20
aVSo they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.
p21
aVI'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VIn 1827, a fellow called George Pocock
p26
aVactually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies
p27
aVin races against horse carriages across the English countryside.
p28
aVThen of course, at the dawn of aviation,
p29
aVall of the great inventors of the time \u2014
p30
aVlike Hargreaves, like Langley,
p31
aVeven Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, who was flying this kite \u2014
p32
aVwere doing so in the pursuit of aviation.
p33
aa(lp34
VThen these two fellows came along,
p35
aVand they were flying kites to develop the control systems
p36
aVthat would ultimately enable powered human flight.
p37
aVSo this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright,
p38
aVand the Wright Flyer.
p39
aVAnd their experiments with kites led to this
p40
aVmomentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the
p41
aVfirst-ever 12-second human flight.
p42
aVAnd that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut unfortunately, it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys.
p45
aVThat was until the 1970s, where we had the last energy crisis.
p46
aVAnd a fabulous man called Miles Loyd
p47
aVwho lives on the outskirts of San Francisco,
p48
aVwrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored
p49
aVin the Journal of Energy
p50
aVabout how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string
p51
aVto generate enormous amounts of electricity.
p52
aVThe real key observation he made is that
p53
aVa free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power
p54
aVin a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo turbines grew. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height,
p57
aVbut they can't really go a lot higher,
p58
aVand more height is where the more wind is, and more power \u2014
p59
aVas much as twice as much.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo cut to now. We still have an energy crisis,
p62
aVand now we have a climate crisis as well. You know,
p63
aVso humans generate about 12 trillion watts,
p64
aVor 12 terawatts, from fossil fuels.
p65
aVAnd Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets,
p66
aVand in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years,
p67
aVwe have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow.
p68
aVWind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar:
p69
aV3600 terawatts, more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over.
p70
aVThe majority of it is in the higher altitudes, above 300 feet,
p71
aVwhere we don't have a technology as yet to get there.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo this is the dawn of the new age of kites.
p74
aVThis is our test site on Maui, flying across the sky.
p75
aVI'm now going to show you
p76
aVthe first autonomous generation of power
p77
aVby every child's favorite plaything.
p78
aVAs you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.
p79
aVIt makes you a little nauseous.
p80
aVAnd here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts \u2014
p81
aVso, enough to power probably five United States households \u2014
p82
aVwith a kite not much larger than this piano.
p83
aVAnd the real significant thing here
p84
aVis we're developing the control systems,
p85
aVas did the Wright brothers, that would enable sustained, long-duration flight.
p86
aVAnd it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow \u2014
p89
aVthat's tracing your name in the sky.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd this is where we're actually going.
p92
aVSo we're beyond the 12-second steps.
p93
aVAnd we're working towards megawatt-scale machines
p94
aVthat fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo you ask, how big are those machines?
p97
aVWell, this paper plane would be maybe a \u2014 oop!
p98
aVThat would be enough to power your cell phone.
p99
aVYour Cessna would be 230 killowatts.
p100
aVIf you'd loan me your Gulfstream, I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt.
p101
aVIf you give me a 747, I'll make six megawatts,
p102
aVwhich is more than the largest wind turbines today.
p103
aVAnd the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo that is audacious, you say. I agree.
p106
aVBut audacious is what has happened many times before in history.
p107
aVThis is a refrigerator factory,
p108
aVchurning out airplanes for World War II.
p109
aVPrior to World War II, they were making 1000 planes a year.
p110
aVBy 1945, they were making 100,000.
p111
aVWith this factory and 100,000 planes a year,
p112
aVwe could make all of America's electricity in about 10 years.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people
p115
aVwith these dreams. There are many of us.
p116
aVI am lucky enough to work with 30 of them.
p117
aVAnd I think we need to support all of the dreams
p118
aVof the kids out there doing these crazy things.
p119
aVThank you.
p120
aV(Applause)

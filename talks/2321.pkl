VPaul Krugman, the Nobel Prize [winner] in economics, once wrote:
p5
aV"Productivity is not everything, but in the long run,
p6
aVit is almost everything."
p7
aa(lp8
VSo this is serious.
p9
aVThere are not that many things on earth that are "almost everything."
p10
aVProductivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society.
p11
aVSo we have a problem.
p12
aVIn the largest European economies,
p13
aVproductivity used to grow five percent per annum
p14
aVin the '50s, '60s, early '70s.
p15
aVFrom '73 to '83: three percent per annum.
p16
aVFrom '83 to '95: two percent per annum.
p17
aVSince 1995: less than one percent per annum.
p18
aVThe same profile in Japan.
p19
aVThe same profile in the US,
p20
aVdespite a momentary rebound 15 years ago,
p21
aVand despite all the technological innovations
p22
aVaround us: the Internet, the information,
p23
aVthe new information and communication technologies.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhen productivity grows three percent per annum,
p26
aVyou double the standard of living every generation.
p27
aVEvery generation is twice as well-off as its parents'.
p28
aVWhen it grows one percent per annum,
p29
aVit takes three generations to double the standard of living.
p30
aVAnd in this process, many people will be less well-off than their parents.
p31
aVThey will have less of everything:
p32
aVsmaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all,
p33
aVless access to education, to vitamins, to antibiotics, to vaccination \u2014
p34
aVto everything.
p35
aVThink of all the problems that we're facing at the moment.
p36
aVAll.
p37
aVChances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhy this crisis?
p40
aVBecause the basic tenets about efficiency \u2014
p41
aVeffectiveness in organizations, in management \u2014
p42
aVhave become counterproductive for human efforts.
p43
aVEverywhere in public services \u2014 in companies, in the way we work,
p44
aVthe way we innovate, invest \u2014 try to learn to work better.
p45
aVTake the holy trinity of efficiency:
p46
aVclarity, measurement, accountability.
p47
aVThey make human efforts derail.
p48
aa(lp49
VThere are two ways to look at it, to prove it.
p50
aVOne, the one I prefer,
p51
aVis rigorous, elegant, nice \u2014 math.
p52
aVBut the full math version takes a little while,
p53
aVso there is another one.
p54
aVIt is to look at a relay race.
p55
aVThis is what we will do today.
p56
aVIt's a bit more animated, more visual and also faster \u2014 it's a race.
p57
aVHopefully, it's faster.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VWorld championship final \u2014 women.
p62
aVEight teams in the final.
p63
aVThe fastest team is the US team.
p64
aVThey have the fastest women on earth.
p65
aVThey are the favorite team to win.
p66
aVNotably, if you compare them to an average team,
p67
aVsay, the French team,
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
Vbased on their best performances in the 100-meter race,
p72
aVif you add the individual times of the US runners,
p73
aVthey arrive at the finish line 3.2 meters ahead of the French team.
p74
aVAnd this year, the US team is in great shape.
p75
aVBased on their best performance this year,
p76
aVthey arrive 6.4 meters ahead of the French team,
p77
aVbased on the data.
p78
aVWe are going to look at the race.
p79
aVAt some point you will see, towards the end,
p80
aVthat Torri Edwards, the fourth US runner, is ahead.
p81
aVNot surprising \u2014 this year she got the gold medal in the 100-meter race.
p82
aVAnd by the way, Chryste Gaines, the second runner in the US team,
p83
aVis the fastest woman on earth.
p84
aVSo, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.
p85
aVWhere are the two fastest? On the US team.
p86
aVAnd the two other runners on the US team are not bad, either.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VSo clearly, the US team has won the war for talent.
p91
aVBut behind, the average team is trying to catch up.
p92
aVLet's watch the race.
p93

p97
aa(lp98
VYves Morieux: So what happened?
p99
aVThe fastest team did not win; the slower one did.
p100
aVBy the way, I hope you appreciate
p101
aVthe deep historical research I did to make the French look good.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VBut let's not exaggerate \u2014 it's not archeology, either.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VBut why?
p110
aVBecause of cooperation.
p111
aVWhen you hear this sentence:
p112
aV"Thanks to cooperation, the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts."
p113
aVThis is not poetry; this is not philosophy.
p114
aVThis is math.
p115
aVThose who carry the baton are slower,
p116
aVbut their baton is faster.
p117
aVMiracle of cooperation:
p118
aVit multiplies energy, intelligence in human efforts.
p119
aVIt is the essence of human efforts:
p120
aVhow we work together, how each effort contributes to the efforts of others.
p121
aVWith cooperation, we can do more with less.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, what happens to cooperation when the holy grail \u2014
p124
aVthe holy trinity, even \u2014
p125
aVof clarity, measurement, accountability \u2014
p126
aVappears?
p127
aa(lp128
VClarity.
p129
aVManagement reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity.
p130
aVCompliance audits, consultants' diagnostics.
p131
aVWe need more clarity, we need to clarify the roles, the processes.
p132
aVIt is as though the runners on the team were saying,
p133
aV"Let's be clear \u2014 where does my role really start and end?
p134
aVAm I supposed to run for 95 meters, 96, 97...?"
p135
aVIt's important, let's be clear.
p136
aVIf you say 97, after 97 meters,
p137
aVpeople will drop the baton, whether there is someone to take it or not.
p138
aa(lp139
VAccountability.
p140
aVWe are constantly trying to put accountability
p141
aVin someone's hands.
p142
aVWho is accountable for this process?
p143
aVWe need somebody accountable for this process.
p144
aVSo in the relay race, since passing the baton is so important,
p145
aVthen we need somebody clearly accountable for passing the baton.
p146
aVSo between each runner,
p147
aVnow we will have a new dedicated athlete,
p148
aVclearly dedicated to taking the baton from one runner,
p149
aVand passing it to the next runner.
p150
aVAnd we will have at least two like that.
p151
aVWell, will we, in that case, win the race?
p152
aVThat I don't know, but for sure,
p153
aVwe would have a clear interface,
p154
aVa clear line of accountability.
p155
aVWe will know who to blame.
p156
aVBut we'll never win the race.
p157
aVIf you think about it, we pay more attention
p158
aVto knowing who to blame in case we fail,
p159
aVthan to creating the conditions to succeed.
p160
aVAll the human intelligence put in organization design \u2014
p161
aVurban structures, processing systems \u2014
p162
aVwhat is the real goal?
p163
aVTo have somebody guilty in case they fail.
p164
aVWe are creating organizations able to fail,
p165
aVbut in a compliant way,
p166
aVwith somebody clearly accountable when we fail.
p167
aVAnd we are quite effective at that \u2014 failing.
p168
aa(lp169
VMeasurement.
p170
aVWhat gets measured gets done.
p171
aVLook, to pass the baton, you have to do it at the right time,
p172
aVin the right hand, at the right speed.
p173
aVBut to do that, you have to put energy in your arm.
p174
aVThis energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs.
p175
aVIt will come at the expense of your measurable speed.
p176
aVYou have to shout early enough to the next runner
p177
aVwhen you will pass the baton, to signal that you are arriving,
p178
aVso that the next runner can prepare, can anticipate.
p179
aVAnd you have to shout loud.
p180
aVBut the blood, the energy that will be in your throat
p181
aVwill not be in your legs.
p182
aVBecause you know, there are eight people shouting at the same time.
p183
aVSo you have to recognize the voice of your colleague.
p184
aVYou cannot say, "Is it you?"
p185
aVToo late!
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VNow, let's look at the race in slow motion,
p190
aVand concentrate on the third runner.
p191
aVLook at where she allocates her efforts,
p192
aVher energy, her attention.
p193
aVNot all in her legs \u2014 that would be great for her own speed \u2014
p194
aVbut in also in her throat, arm, eye, brain.
p195
aVThat makes a difference in whose legs?
p196
aVIn the legs of the next runner.
p197
aVBut when the next runner runs super-fast,
p198
aVis it because she made a super effort,
p199
aVor because of the way the third runner passed the baton?
p200
aVThere is no metric on earth that will give us the answer.
p201
aVAnd if we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance,
p202
aVthey will put their energy, their attention, their blood
p203
aVin what can get measured \u2014 in their legs.
p204
aVAnd the baton will fall and slow down.
p205
aa(lp206
VTo cooperate is not a super effort,
p207
aVit is how you allocate your effort.
p208
aVIt is to take a risk,
p209
aVbecause you sacrifice the ultimate protection
p210
aVgranted by objectively measurable individual performance.
p211
aVIt is to make a super difference in the performance of others,
p212
aVwith whom we are compared.
p213
aVIt takes being stupid to cooperate, then.
p214
aVAnd people are not stupid; they don't cooperate.
p215
aa(lp216
VYou know, clarity, accountability, measurement were OK
p217
aVwhen the world was simpler.
p218
aVBut business has become much more complex.
p219
aVWith my teams, we have measured
p220
aVthe evolution of complexity in business.
p221
aVIt is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers,
p222
aVto build advantage on a global scale,
p223
aVto create value.
p224
aVAnd the more business gets complex,
p225
aVthe more, in the name of clarity, accountability, measurement
p226
aVwe multiply structures, processes, systems.
p227
aa(lp228
VYou know, this drive for clarity and accountability triggers
p229
aVa counterproductive multiplication of interfaces, middle offices,
p230
aVcoordinators that do not only mobilize people and resources,
p231
aVbut that also add obstacles.
p232
aVAnd the more complicated the organization,
p233
aVthe more difficult it is to understand what is really happening.
p234
aVSo we need summaries, proxies, reports,
p235
aVkey performance indicators, metrics.
p236
aVSo people put their energy in what can get measured,
p237
aVat the expense of cooperation.
p238
aVAnd as performance deteriorates,
p239
aVwe add even more structure, process, systems.
p240
aVPeople spend their time in meetings,
p241
aVwriting reports they have to do, undo and redo.
p242
aVBased on our analysis, teams in these organizations
p243
aVspend between 40 and 80 percent of their time wasting their time,
p244
aVbut working harder and harder, longer and longer,
p245
aVon less and less value-adding activities.
p246
aVThis is what is killing productivity,
p247
aVwhat makes people suffer at work.
p248
aa(lp249
VOur organizations are wasting human intelligence.
p250
aVThey have turned against human efforts.
p251
aVWhen people don't cooperate,
p252
aVdon't blame their mindsets, their mentalities, their personality \u2014
p253
aVlook at the work situations.
p254
aVIs it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not,
p255
aVif, when they cooperate, they are individually worse off?
p256
aVWhy would they cooperate?
p257
aVWhen we blame personalities
p258
aVinstead of the clarity, the accountability, the measurement,
p259
aVwe add injustice to ineffectiveness.
p260
aa(lp261
VWe need to create organizations
p262
aVin which it becomes individually useful for people to cooperate.
p263
aVRemove the interfaces, the middle offices \u2014
p264
aVall these complicated coordination structures.
p265
aVDon't look for clarity; go for fuzziness.
p266
aVFuzziness overlaps.
p267
aVRemove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance.
p268
aVSpeed the "what."
p269
aVLook at cooperation, the "how."
p270
aVHow did you pass the baton?
p271
aVDid you throw it, or did you pass it effectively?
p272
aVAm I putting my energy in what can get measured \u2014
p273
aVmy legs, my speed \u2014 or in passing the baton?
p274
aa(lp275
VYou, as leaders, as managers,
p276
aVare you making it individually useful for people to cooperate?
p277
aVThe future of our organizations,
p278
aVour companies, our societies
p279
aVhinges on your answer to these questions.
p280
aa(lp281
VThank you.

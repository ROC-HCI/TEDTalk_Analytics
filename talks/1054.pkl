VI just did something I've never done before.
p5
aVI spent a week at sea on a research vessel.
p6
aVNow I'm not a scientist,
p7
aVbut I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team
p8
aVfrom the University of South Florida
p9
aVwho have been tracking the travels of BP's oil
p10
aVin the Gulf of Mexico.
p11
aVThis is the boat we were on, by the way.
p12
aVThe scientists I was with
p13
aVwere not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff \u2014
p14
aVthe birds, the turtles,
p15
aVthe dolphins, the glamorous stuff.
p16
aVThey're looking at the really little stuff
p17
aVthat gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff
p18
aVthat eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.
p19
aVAnd what they're finding
p20
aVis that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants
p21
aVcan be highly toxic to phytoplankton,
p22
aVwhich is very bad news,
p23
aVbecause so much life depends on it.
p24
aVSo contrary to what we heard a few months back
p25
aVabout how 75 percent of that oil
p26
aVsort of magically disappeared
p27
aVand we didn't have to worry about it,
p28
aVthis disaster is still unfolding.
p29
aVIt's still working its way up the food chain.
p30
aVNow this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.
p31
aVRachel Carson \u2014
p32
aVthe godmother of modern environmentalism \u2014
p33
aVwarned us about this very thing
p34
aVback in 1962.
p35
aVShe pointed out that the "control men" \u2014
p36
aVas she called them \u2014
p37
aVwho carpet-bombed towns and fields
p38
aVwith toxic insecticides like DDT,
p39
aVwere only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects,
p40
aVnot the birds.
p41
aVBut they forgot this:
p42
aVthe fact that birds dine on grubs,
p43
aVthat robins eat lots of worms
p44
aVnow saturated with DDT.
p45
aVAnd so, robin eggs failed to hatch,
p46
aVsongbirds died en masse,
p47
aVtowns fell silent.
p48
aVThus the title "Silent Spring."
p49
aVI've been trying to pinpoint
p50
aVwhat keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,
p51
aVbecause I'm Canadian,
p52
aVand I can draw no ancestral ties.
p53
aVAnd I think what it is
p54
aVis I don't think we have fully come to terms
p55
aVwith the meaning of this disaster,
p56
aVwith what it meant to witness a hole
p57
aVripped in our world,
p58
aVwith what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth
p59
aVgush forth on live TV,
p60
aV24 hours a day,
p61
aVfor months.
p62
aVAfter telling ourselves for so long
p63
aVthat our tools and technology can control nature,
p64
aVsuddenly we were face-to-face
p65
aVwith our weakness,
p66
aVwith our lack of control,
p67
aVas the oil burst out
p68
aVof every attempt to contain it \u2014
p69
aV"top hats," "top kills"
p70
aVand, most memorably, the "junk shot" \u2014
p71
aVthe bright idea
p72
aVof firing old tires and golf balls
p73
aVdown that hole in the world.
p74
aVBut even more striking
p75
aVthan the ferocious power emanating from that well
p76
aVwas the recklessness
p77
aVwith which that power was unleashed \u2014
p78
aVthe carelessness, the lack of planning
p79
aVthat characterized the operation
p80
aVfrom drilling to clean-up.
p81
aVIf there is one thing
p82
aVBP's watery improv act made clear,
p83
aVit is that, as a culture,
p84
aVwe have become far too willing to gamble
p85
aVwith things that are precious
p86
aVand irreplaceable,
p87
aVand to do so without a back-up plan,
p88
aVwithout an exit strategy.
p89
aVAnd BP was hardly
p90
aVour first experience of this in recent years.
p91
aVOur leaders barrel into wars,
p92
aVtelling themselves happy stories
p93
aVabout cakewalks and welcome parades.
p94
aVThen, it is years of deadly damage control,
p95
aVFrankensteins of sieges and surges
p96
aVand counter-insurgencies,
p97
aVand once again, no exit strategy.
p98
aVOur financial wizards routinely fall victim
p99
aVto similar overconfidence,
p100
aVconvincing themselves that the latest bubble
p101
aVis a new kind of market \u2014
p102
aVthe kind that never goes down.
p103
aVAnd when it inevitably does,
p104
aVthe best and the brightest
p105
aVreach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot \u2014
p106
aVin this case, throwing massive amounts
p107
aVof much-needed public money
p108
aVdown a very different kind of hole.
p109
aVAs with BP, the hole does get plugged,
p110
aVat least temporarily,
p111
aVbut not before
p112
aVexacting a tremendous price.
p113
aVWe have to figure out
p114
aVwhy we keep letting this happen,
p115
aVbecause we are in the midst
p116
aVof what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all \u2014
p117
aVdeciding what to do, or not to do,
p118
aVabout climate change.
p119
aVNow as you know,
p120
aVa great deal of time is spent,
p121
aVin this country and around the world,
p122
aVinside the climate debate,
p123
aVon the question of, "What if the IPC scientists
p124
aVare all wrong?"
p125
aVNow a far more relevant question \u2014
p126
aVas MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it \u2014
p127
aVis, "What if those scientists are right?"
p128
aVGiven the stakes, the climate crisis
p129
aVclearly calls for us to act
p130
aVbased on the precautionary principle \u2014
p131
aVthe theory that holds
p132
aVthat when human health and the environment
p133
aVare significantly at risk
p134
aVand when the potential damage is irreversible,
p135
aVwe cannot afford to wait
p136
aVfor perfect scientific certainty.
p137
aVBetter to err on the side of caution.
p138
aVMore overt, the burden of proving
p139
aVthat a practice is safe
p140
aVshould not be placed on the public that would be harmed,
p141
aVbut rather on the industry that stands to profit.
p142
aVBut climate policy in the wealthy world \u2014
p143
aVto the extent that such a thing exists \u2014
p144
aVis not based on precaution,
p145
aVbut rather on cost-benefit analysis \u2014
p146
aVfinding the course of action that economists believe
p147
aVwill have the least impact
p148
aVon our GDP.
p149
aVSo rather than asking, as precaution would demand,
p150
aVwhat can we do as quickly as possible
p151
aVto avoid potential catastrophe,
p152
aVwe ask bizarre questions like this:
p153
aV"What is the latest possible moment we can wait
p154
aVbefore we begin seriously lowering emissions?
p155
aVCan we put this off till 2020,
p156
aV2030, 2050?"
p157
aVOr we ask,
p158
aV"How much hotter can we let the planet get
p159
aVand still survive?
p160
aVCan we go with two degrees, three degrees, or \u2014
p161
aVwhere we're currently going \u2014
p162
aVfour degrees Celsius?"
p163
aVAnd by the way,
p164
aVthe assumption that we can safely control
p165
aVthe Earth's awesomely complex climate system
p166
aVas if it had a thermostat,
p167
aVmaking the planet not too hot, not too cold,
p168
aVbut just right \u2014 sort of Goldilocks style \u2014
p169
aVthis is pure fantasy,
p170
aVand it's not coming from the climate scientists.
p171
aVIt's coming from the economists
p172
aVimposing their mechanistic thinking
p173
aVon the science.
p174
aVThe fact is that we simply don't know
p175
aVwhen the warming that we create
p176
aVwill be utterly overwhelmed
p177
aVby feedback loops.
p178
aVSo once again,
p179
aVwhy do we take these crazy risks
p180
aVwith the precious?
p181
aVA range of explanations
p182
aVmay be popping into your mind by now,
p183
aVlike "greed."
p184
aVThis is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,
p185
aVbecause taking big risks, as we all know,
p186
aVpays a lot of money.
p187
aVAnother explanation that you often hear for recklessness
p188
aVis hubris.
p189
aVAnd greed and hubris
p190
aVare intimately intertwined
p191
aVwhen it comes to recklessness.
p192
aVFor instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker
p193
aVtaking home 100 times more
p194
aVthan a brain surgeon,
p195
aVthen you need a narrative,
p196
aVyou need a story
p197
aVthat makes that disparity okay.
p198
aVAnd you actually don't have a lot of options.
p199
aVYou're either an incredibly good scammer,
p200
aVand you're getting away with it \u2014 you gamed the system \u2014
p201
aVor you're some kind of boy genius,
p202
aVthe likes of which the world has never seen.
p203
aVNow both of these options \u2014 the boy genius and the scammer \u2014
p204
aVare going to make you vastly overconfident
p205
aVand therefore more prone
p206
aVto taking even bigger risks in the future.
p207
aVBy the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,
p208
aVhad a plaque on his desk
p209
aVinscribed with this inspirational slogan:
p210
aV"What would you attempt to do
p211
aVif you knew you could not fail?"
p212
aVNow this is actually a popular plaque,
p213
aVand this is a crowd of overachievers,
p214
aVso I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.
p215
aVDon't feel ashamed.
p216
aVPutting fear of failure out of your mind
p217
aVcan be a very good thing
p218
aVif you're training for a triathlon
p219
aVor preparing to give a TEDTalk,
p220
aVbut personally, I think people with the power
p221
aVto detonate our economy and ravage our ecology
p222
aVwould do better having
p223
aVa picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,
p224
aVbecause \u2014 maybe not that one in particular \u2014
p225
aVbut I want them thinking about the possibility of failure
p226
aVall of the time.
p227
aVSo we have greed,
p228
aVwe've got overconfidence/hubris,
p229
aVbut since we're here at TEDWomen,
p230
aVlet's consider one other factor
p231
aVthat could be contributing in some small way
p232
aVto societal recklessness.
p233
aVNow I'm not going to belabor this point,
p234
aVbut studies do show that, as investors,
p235
aVwomen are much less prone
p236
aVto taking reckless risks than men,
p237
aVprecisely because, as we've already heard,
p238
aVwomen tend not to suffer from overconfidence
p239
aVin the same way that men do.
p240
aVSo it turns out
p241
aVthat being paid less and praised less
p242
aVhas its upsides \u2014
p243
aVfor society at least.
p244
aVThe flipside of this
p245
aVis that constantly being told
p246
aVthat you are gifted, chosen
p247
aVand born to rule
p248
aVhas distinct societal downsides.
p249
aVAnd this problem \u2014 call it the "perils of privilege" \u2014
p250
aVbrings us closer, I think,
p251
aVto the root of our collective recklessness.
p252
aVBecause none of us \u2014 at least in the global North \u2014
p253
aVneither men nor women,
p254
aVare fully exempt from this message.
p255
aVHere's what I'm talking about.
p256
aVWhether we actively believe them
p257
aVor consciously reject them,
p258
aVour culture remains in the grips
p259
aVof certain archetypal stories
p260
aVabout our supremacy
p261
aVover others and over nature \u2014
p262
aVthe narrative of the newly discovered frontier
p263
aVand the conquering pioneer,
p264
aVthe narrative of manifest destiny,
p265
aVthe narrative of apocalypse and salvation.
p266
aVAnd just when you think these stories are fading into history,
p267
aVand that we've gotten over them,
p268
aVthey pop up in the strangest places.
p269
aVFor instance, I stumbled across this advertisement
p270
aVoutside the women's washroom
p271
aVin the Kansas City airport.
p272
aVIt's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,
p273
aVand yes, it really does say,
p274
aV"Slap Mother Nature in the face."
p275
aVAnd I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola \u2014
p276
aVthat's just a bonus.
p277
aVI'm showing it because \u2014
p278
aVthey're not a sponsor, are they? \u2014
p279
aVbecause, in its own way,
p280
aVthis is a crass version
p281
aVof our founding story.
p282
aVWe slapped Mother Nature around and won,
p283
aVand we always win,
p284
aVbecause dominating nature is our destiny.
p285
aVBut this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.
p286
aVThere's another one, equally important,
p287
aVabout how that very same Mother Nature
p288
aVis so nurturing and so resilient
p289
aVthat we can never make a dent in her abundance.
p290
aVLet's hear from Tony Hayward again.
p291
aV"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.
p292
aVThe amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it
p293
aVis tiny in relation to the total water volume."
p294
aVIn other words, the ocean is big;
p295
aVshe can take it.
p296
aVIt is this underlying assumption of limitlessness
p297
aVthat makes it possible
p298
aVto take the reckless risks that we do.
p299
aVBecause this is our real master-narrative:
p300
aVhowever much we mess up,
p301
aVthere will always be more \u2014
p302
aVmore water, more land,
p303
aVmore untapped resources.
p304
aVA new bubble will replace the old one.
p305
aVA new technology will come along
p306
aVto fix the messes we made with the last one.
p307
aVIn a way, that is the story
p308
aVof the settling of the Americas,
p309
aVthe supposedly inexhaustible frontier
p310
aVto which Europeans escaped.
p311
aVAnd it's also the story of modern capitalism,
p312
aVbecause it was the wealth from this land
p313
aVthat gave birth to our economic system,
p314
aVone that cannot survive without perpetual growth
p315
aVand an unending supply
p316
aVof new frontiers.
p317
aVNow the problem is
p318
aVthat the story was always a lie.
p319
aVThe Earth always did have limits.
p320
aVThey were just beyond our sights.
p321
aVAnd now we are hitting those limits
p322
aVon multiple fronts.
p323
aVI believe that we know this,
p324
aVyet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.
p325
aVNot only do we continue to tell and retell
p326
aVthe same tired stories,
p327
aVbut we are now doing so
p328
aVwith a frenzy and a fury
p329
aVthat, frankly, verges on camp.
p330
aVHow else to explain the cultural space
p331
aVoccupied by Sarah Palin?
p332
aVNow on the one hand,
p333
aVexhorting us to "drill, baby, drill,"
p334
aVbecause God put those resources into the ground
p335
aVin order for us to exploit them,
p336
aVand on the other, glorying in the wilderness
p337
aVof Alaska's untouched beauty
p338
aVon her hit reality TV show.
p339
aVThe twin message is as comforting as it is mad.
p340
aVIgnore those creeping fears
p341
aVthat we have finally hit the wall.
p342
aVThere are still no limits.
p343
aVThere will always be another frontier.
p344
aVSo stop worrying and keep shopping.
p345
aVNow, would that this were just about
p346
aVSarah Palin and her reality TV show.
p347
aVIn environmental circles,
p348
aVwe often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,
p349
aVwe are continuing with business as usual.
p350
aVThis assessment, unfortunately,
p351
aVis far too optimistic.
p352
aVThe truth is that we have already exhausted
p353
aVso much of the easily accessible fossil fuels
p354
aVthat we have already entered
p355
aVa far riskier business era,
p356
aVthe era of extreme energy.
p357
aVSo that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,
p358
aVincluding the icy Arctic seas,
p359
aVwhere a clean-up may simply be impossible.
p360
aVIt means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas
p361
aVand massive strip-mining operations for coal,
p362
aVthe likes of which we haven't yet seen.
p363
aVAnd most controversially, it means the tar sands.
p364
aVI'm always surprised by how little
p365
aVpeople outside of Canada
p366
aVknow about the Alberta Tar Sands,
p367
aVwhich this year are projected to become
p368
aVthe number one source of imported oil
p369
aVto the United States.
p370
aVIt's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,
p371
aVbecause I believe it speaks to recklessness
p372
aVand the path we're on
p373
aVlike little else.
p374
aVSo this is where the tar sands live,
p375
aVunder one of the last magnificent
p376
aVBoreal forests.
p377
aVThe oil is not liquid.
p378
aVYou can't just drill a hole and pump it out.
p379
aVTar sand's oil is solid,
p380
aVmixed in with the soil.
p381
aVSo to get at it,
p382
aVyou first have to get rid of the trees.
p383
aVThen, you rip off the topsoil
p384
aVand get at that oily sand.
p385
aVThe process requires a huge amount of water,
p386
aVwhich is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.
p387
aVThat's very bad news for local indigenous people
p388
aVliving downstream
p389
aVwho are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.
p390
aVNow looking at these images,
p391
aVit's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,
p392
aVwhich can already be seen from space
p393
aVand could grow to an area the size of England.
p394
aVI find it helps actually
p395
aVto look at the dump trucks that move the earth,
p396
aVthe largest ever built.
p397
aVThat's a person down there by the wheel.
p398
aVMy point is that
p399
aVthis is not oil drilling.
p400
aVIt's not even mining.
p401
aVIt is terrestrial skinning.
p402
aVVast, vivid landscapes
p403
aVare being gutted,
p404
aVleft monochromatic gray.
p405
aVNow I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned
p406
aVthis would be an abomination
p407
aVif it emitted not one particle of carbon.
p408
aVBut the truth is that, on average,
p409
aVturning that gunk into crude oil
p410
aVproduces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution
p411
aVthan it does to produce conventional oil
p412
aVin Canada.
p413
aVHow else to describe this,
p414
aVbut as a form of mass insanity?
p415
aVJust when we know we need to be learning
p416
aVto live on the surface of our planet,
p417
aVoff the power of sun, wind and waves,
p418
aVwe are frantically digging
p419
aVto get at the dirtiest,
p420
aVhighest-emitting stuff imaginable.
p421
aVThis is where our story of endless growth
p422
aVhas taken us,
p423
aVto this black hole at the center of my country \u2014
p424
aVa place of such planetary pain
p425
aVthat, like the BP gusher,
p426
aVone can only stand to look at it for so long.
p427
aVAs Jared Diamond and others have shown us,
p428
aVthis is how civilizations commit suicide,
p429
aVby slamming their foot on the accelerator
p430
aVat the exact moment
p431
aVwhen they should be putting on the brakes.
p432
aVThe problem is that our master-narrative
p433
aVhas an answer for that too.
p434
aVAt the very last minute, we are going to get saved
p435
aVjust like in every Hollywood movie,
p436
aVjust like in the Rapture.
p437
aVBut, of course, our secular religion is technology.
p438
aVNow, you may have noticed
p439
aVmore and more headlines like these.
p440
aVThe idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called,
p441
aVis that, as the planet heats up,
p442
aVwe may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles
p443
aVinto the stratosphere
p444
aVto reflect some of the sun's rays
p445
aVback to space,
p446
aVthereby cooling the planet.
p447
aVThe wackiest plan \u2014 and I'm not making this up \u2014
p448
aVwould put what is essentially a garden hose
p449
aV18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,
p450
aVsuspended by balloons,
p451
aVto spew sulfur dioxide.
p452
aVSo, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.
p453
aVThink of it as the ultimate junk shot.
p454
aVThe serious scientists involved in this research
p455
aVall stress that these techniques
p456
aVare entirely untested.
p457
aVThey don't know if they'll work,
p458
aVand they have no idea
p459
aVwhat kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.
p460
aVNevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering
p461
aVis being greeted in some circles,
p462
aVparticularly media circles,
p463
aVwith a relief tinged with euphoria.
p464
aVAn escape hatch has been reached.
p465
aVA new frontier has been found.
p466
aVMost importantly,
p467
aVwe don't have to change our lifestyles after all.
p468

VAt the break, I was asked by several people
p5
aVabout my comments about the aging debate.
p6
aVAnd this will be my only comment on it.
p7
aVAnd that is, I understand
p8
aVthat optimists greatly outlive pessimists.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VWhat I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is
p12
aVhow we're about to switch from reading the genetic code
p13
aVto the first stages of beginning
p14
aVto write the code ourselves.
p15
aVIt's only 10 years ago this month
p16
aVwhen we published the first sequence
p17
aVof a free-living organism,
p18
aVthat of haemophilus influenzae.
p19
aVThat took a genome project
p20
aVfrom 13 years down to four months.
p21
aVWe can now do that same genome project
p22
aVin the order of
p23
aVtwo to eight hours.
p24
aVSo in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added:
p25
aVmost human pathogens,
p26
aVa couple of plants,
p27
aVseveral insects and several mammals,
p28
aVincluding the human genome.
p29
aVGenomics at this stage of the thinking
p30
aVfrom a little over 10 years ago
p31
aVwas, by the end of this year, we might have
p32
aVbetween three and five genomes sequenced;
p33
aVit's on the order of several hundred.
p34
aVWe just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
p35
aVto sequence 130 genomes this year,
p36
aVas a side project from environmental organisms.
p37
aVSo the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut as we look, what's out there,
p40
aVwe've barely scratched the surface
p41
aVon what is available on this planet.
p42
aVMost people don't realize it, because they're invisible,
p43
aVbut microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass,
p44
aVwhereas all animals only make up about
p45
aVone one-thousandth of all the biomass.
p46
aVAnd maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often,
p47
aVbut if you ever make it to the sea,
p48
aVand you swallow a mouthful of seawater,
p49
aVkeep in mind that each milliliter
p50
aVhas about a million bacteria
p51
aVand on the order of 10 million viruses.
p52
aa(lp53
VLess than 5,000 microbial species
p54
aVhave been characterized as of two years ago,
p55
aVand so we decided to do something about it.
p56
aVAnd we started the Sorcerer II Expedition,
p57
aVwhere we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions,
p58
aVtrying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.
p59
aVWe started in Bermuda for our test project,
p60
aVthen moved up to Halifax,
p61
aVworking down the U.S. East Coast,
p62
aVthe Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal,
p63
aVthrough to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific,
p64
aVand we're in the process now of working our way
p65
aVacross the Indian Ocean.
p66
aVIt's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel,
p67
aVin part to help excite young people
p68
aVabout going into science.
p69
aVThe experiments are incredibly simple.
p70
aVWe just take seawater and we filter it,
p71
aVand we collect different size organisms on different filters,
p72
aVand then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville,
p73
aVwhere we can sequence a hundred million letters
p74
aVof the genetic code every 24 hours.
p75
aVAnd with doing this,
p76
aVwe've made some amazing discoveries.
p77
aa(lp78
VFor example, it was thought that the visual pigments
p79
aVthat are in our eyes \u2014 there was only one or two organisms
p80
aVin the environment that had these same pigments.
p81
aVIt turns out, almost every species
p82
aVin the upper parts of the ocean
p83
aVin warm parts of the world
p84
aVhave these same photoreceptors,
p85
aVand use sunlight as the source of their energy
p86
aVand communication.
p87
aVFrom one site, from one barrel of seawater,
p88
aVwe discovered 1.3 million new genes
p89
aVand as many as 50,000 new species.
p90
aa(lp91
VWe've extended this to the air
p92
aVnow with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.
p93
aVWe're measuring how many viruses and bacteria
p94
aVall of us are breathing in and out every day,
p95
aVparticularly on airplanes
p96
aVor closed auditoriums.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVWe filter through some simple apparatuses;
p99
aVwe collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day
p100
aVfiltering on top of a building in New York City.
p101
aVAnd we're in the process of sequencing all that
p102
aVat the present time.
p103
aa(lp104
VJust on the data collection side,
p105
aVjust where we are through the Galapagos,
p106
aVwe're finding that almost every 200 miles,
p107
aVwe see tremendous diversity
p108
aVin the samples in the ocean.
p109
aVSome of these make logical sense,
p110
aVin terms of different temperature gradients.
p111
aVSo this is a satellite photograph
p112
aVbased on temperatures \u2014 red being warm,
p113
aVblue being cold \u2014
p114
aVand we found there's a tremendous difference between
p115
aVthe warm water samples and the cold water samples,
p116
aVin terms of abundant species.
p117
aVThe other thing that surprised us quite a bit
p118
aVis these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light,
p119
aVand we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.
p120
aVAnd these vary tremendously from region to region.
p121
aVMaybe not surprisingly,
p122
aVin the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue,
p123
aVthe photoreceptors tend to see blue light.
p124
aVWhen there's a lot of chlorophyll around,
p125
aVthey see a lot of green light.
p126
aVBut they vary even more,
p127
aVpossibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet
p128
aVin the extremes.
p129
aa(lp130
VJust to try and get an assessment
p131
aVof what our gene repertoire was,
p132
aVwe assembled all the data \u2014
p133
aVincluding all of ours thus far from the expedition,
p134
aVwhich represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet \u2014
p135
aVand it totaled around 29 million genes.
p136
aVAnd we tried to put these into gene families
p137
aVto see what these discoveries are:
p138
aVAre we just discovering new members of known families,
p139
aVor are we discovering new families?
p140
aVAnd it turns out we have about 50,000
p141
aVmajor gene families,
p142
aVbut every new sample we take in the environment
p143
aVadds in a linear fashion to these new families.
p144
aVSo we're at the earliest stages of discovery
p145
aVabout basic genes,
p146
aVcomponents and life on this planet.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhen we look at the so-called evolutionary tree,
p149
aVwe're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.
p150
aVOf those roughly 29 million genes,
p151
aVwe only have around 24,000
p152
aVin our genome.
p153
aVAnd if you take all animals together,
p154
aVwe probably share less than 30,000
p155
aVand probably maybe a dozen
p156
aVor more thousand different gene families.
p157
aVI view that these genes are now
p158
aVnot only the design components of evolution.
p159
aVAnd we think in a gene-centric view \u2014
p160
aVmaybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas \u2014
p161
aVthan in a genome-centric view,
p162
aVwhich are different constructs of these gene components.
p163
aa(lp164
VSynthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA,
p165
aVhas changed at sort of the same pace
p166
aVthat DNA sequencing has
p167
aVover the last decade or two,
p168
aVand is getting very rapid and very cheap.
p169
aVOur first thought about synthetic genomics came
p170
aVwhen we sequenced the second genome back in 1995,
p171
aVand that from mycoplasma genitalium.
p172
aVAnd we have really nice T-shirts that say,
p173
aVyou know, "I heart my genitalium."
p174
aVThis is actually just a microorganism.
p175
aVBut it has roughly 500 genes.
p176
aVHaemophilus had 1,800 genes.
p177
aVAnd we simply asked the question,
p178
aVif one species needs 800, another 500,
p179
aVis there a smaller set of genes
p180
aVthat might comprise a minimal operating system?
p181
aa(lp182
VSo we started doing transposon mutagenesis.
p183
aVTransposons are just small pieces of DNA
p184
aVthat randomly insert in the genetic code.
p185
aVAnd if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.
p186
aVSo we made a map of all the genes
p187
aVthat could take transposon insertions
p188
aVand we called those "non-essential genes."
p189
aVBut it turns out the environment is very critical for this,
p190
aVand you can only
p191
aVdefine an essential or non-essential gene
p192
aVbased on exactly what's in the environment.
p193
aVWe also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach
p194
aVwith the genomes of 13 related organisms,
p195
aVand we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.
p196
aVAnd we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes
p197
aVcommon to all 13 organisms.
p198
aVThe pool expanded a little bit if we ignored
p199
aVone intracellular parasite;
p200
aVit expanded even more
p201
aVwhen we looked at core sets of genes
p202
aVof around 310 or so.
p203
aVSo we think that we can expand
p204
aVor contract genomes, depending on your point of view here,
p205
aVto maybe 300 to 400 genes
p206
aVfrom the minimal of 500.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe only way to prove these ideas
p209
aVwas to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them,
p210
aVand we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.
p211
aVWe found that synthesizing accurate DNA
p212
aVin large pieces was extremely difficult.
p213
aVHam Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this,
p214
aVdeveloped an exciting new method
p215
aVthat allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus
p216
aVin only a two-week period
p217
aVthat was 100 percent accurate,
p218
aVin terms of its sequence and its biology.
p219
aVIt was a quite exciting experiment \u2014 when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA,
p220
aVinjected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden,
p221
aVthat DNA started driving the production of the virus particles
p222
aVthat turned around and then killed the bacteria.
p223
aVThis was not the first synthetic virus \u2014
p224
aVa polio virus had been made a year before \u2014
p225
aVbut it was only one ten-thousandth as active
p226
aVand it took three years to do.
p227
aVThis is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.
p228
aVThis is a case where the software now builds its own hardware,
p229
aVand that's the notions that we have with biology.
p230
aa(lp231
VPeople immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare,
p232
aVand I had recent testimony before a Senate committee,
p233
aVand a special committee the U.S. government has set up
p234
aVto review this area.
p235
aVAnd I think it's important to keep reality in mind,
p236
aVversus what happens with people's imaginations.
p237
aVBasically, any virus that's been sequenced today \u2014
p238
aVthat genome can be made.
p239
aVAnd people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox,
p240
aVbut the DNA from this organism is not infective.
p241
aVSo even if somebody made the smallpox genome,
p242
aVthat DNA itself would not cause infections.
p243
aVThe real concern that security departments have
p244
aVis designer viruses.
p245
aVAnd there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union,
p246
aVthat had major efforts
p247
aVon trying to create biological warfare agents.
p248
aVIf that research is truly discontinued,
p249
aVthere should be very little activity
p250
aVon the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.
p251
aa(lp252
VI think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.
p253
aVAnd possibly eukaryotic cells,
p254
aVthose that we have,
p255
aVare possible within a decade.
p256
aVSo we're now making several dozen different constructs,
p257
aVbecause we can vary the cassettes and the genes
p258
aVthat go into this artificial chromosome.
p259
aVThe key is, how do you put all of the others?
p260
aVWe start with these fragments,
p261
aVand then we have a homologous recombination system
p262
aVthat reassembles those into a chromosome.
p263
aa(lp264
VThis is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans,
p265
aVthat can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.
p266
aVIt reassembles its genome after this radiation burst
p267
aVin about 12 to 24 hours,
p268
aVafter its chromosomes are literally blown apart.
p269
aVThis organism is ubiquitous on the planet,
p270
aVand exists perhaps now
p271
aVin outer space due to all our travel there.
p272
aVThis is a glass beaker after
p273
aVabout half a million rads of radiation.
p274
aVThe glass started to burn and crack,
p275
aVwhile the microbes sitting in the bottom
p276
aVjust got happier and happier.
p277
aVHere's an actual picture of what happens:
p278
aVthe top of this shows the genome
p279
aVafter 1.7 million rads of radiation.
p280
aVThe chromosome is literally blown apart.
p281
aVAnd here's that same DNA automatically reassembled
p282
aV24 hours later.
p283
aVIt's truly stunning that these organisms can do that,
p284
aVand we probably have thousands,
p285
aVif not tens of thousands, of different species
p286
aVon this planet that are capable of doing that.
p287
aVAfter these genomes are synthesized,
p288
aVthe first step is just transplanting them
p289
aVinto a cell without a genome.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential,
p292
aVnot only for understanding the basis of biology
p293
aVbut for hopefully environmental and society issues.
p294
aVFor example, from the third organism we sequenced,
p295
aVMethanococcus jannaschii \u2014 it lives in boiling water temperatures;
p296
aVits energy source is hydrogen
p297
aVand all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.
p298
aVSo we know lots of different pathways,
p299
aVthousands of different organisms now
p300
aVthat live off of CO2,
p301
aVand can capture that back.
p302
aVSo instead of using carbon from oil
p303
aVfor synthetic processes,
p304
aVwe have the chance of using carbon
p305
aVand capturing it back from the atmosphere,
p306
aVconverting that into biopolymers
p307
aVor other products.
p308
aVWe have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide,
p309
aVand we use as a reducing power
p310
aVto split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
p311
aVAlso, there's numerous pathways
p312
aVthat can be engineered metabolizing methane.
p313
aVAnd DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway
p314
aVto capture and convert the methane
p315
aVfrom the gas fields there into useful products.
p316
aa(lp317
VWithin a short while, I think there's going to be a new field
p318
aVcalled "Combinatorial Genomics,"
p319
aVbecause with these new synthesis capabilities,
p320
aVthese vast gene array repertoires
p321
aVand the homologous recombination,
p322
aVwe think we can design a robot to make
p323
aVmaybe a million different chromosomes a day.
p324
aVAnd therefore, as with all biology,
p325
aVyou get selection through screening,
p326
aVwhether you're screening for hydrogen production,
p327
aVor chemical production, or just viability.
p328
aVTo understand the role of these genes
p329
aVis going to be well within reach.
p330
aa(lp331
VWe're trying to modify photosynthesis
p332
aVto produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.
p333
aVPhotosynthesis is modulated by oxygen,
p334
aVand we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase
p335
aVthat we think will totally change this process.
p336
aVWe're also combining cellulases,
p337
aVthe enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars
p338
aVand fermentation in the same cell
p339
aVfor producing ethanol.
p340
aVPharmaceutical production is already under way
p341
aVin major laboratories
p342
aVusing microbes.
p343
aVThe chemistry from compounds in the environment
p344
aVis orders of magnitude more complex
p345
aVthan our best chemists can produce.
p346
aVI think future engineered species
p347
aVcould be the source of food,
p348
aVhopefully a source of energy,
p349
aVenvironmental remediation
p350
aVand perhaps
p351
aVreplacing the petrochemical industry.
p352
aa(lp353
VLet me just close with ethical and policy studies.
p354
aVWe delayed the start of our experiments in 1999
p355
aVuntil we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review
p356
aVas to whether we should try and make an artificial species.
p357
aVEvery major religion participated in this.
p358
aVIt was actually a very strange study,
p359
aVbecause the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books,
p360
aVand they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life,
p361
aVso it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns
p362
aVwere biological warfare aspects of this,
p363
aVbut gave us the go ahead to start these experiments
p364
aVfor the reasons we were doing them.
p365
aa(lp366
VRight now the Sloan Foundation has just funded
p367
aVa multi-institutional study on this,
p368
aVto work out what the risk and benefits to society are,
p369
aVand the rules that scientific teams such as my own
p370
aVshould be using in this area,
p371
aVand we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.
p372
aVThese are complex issues.
p373
aVExcept for the threat of bio-terrorism,
p374
aVthey're very simple issues in terms of,
p375
aVcan we design things to produce clean energy,
p376
aVperhaps revolutionizing
p377
aVwhat developing countries can do
p378
aVand provide through various simple processes.
p379
aVThank you very much.

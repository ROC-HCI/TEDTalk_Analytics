VI'm going to talk to you today
p5
aVabout the design of medical technology for low-resource settings.
p6
aVI study health systems in these countries.
p7
aVAnd one of the major gaps in care,
p8
aValmost across the board,
p9
aVis access to safe surgery.
p10
aVNow one of the major bottlenecks that we've found
p11
aVthat's sort of preventing both the access in the first place,
p12
aVand the safety of those surgeries that do happen, is anesthesia.
p13
aVAnd actually, it's the model that we expect to work
p14
aVfor delivering anesthesia in these environments.
p15
aa(lp16
VHere, we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the US,
p17
aVor any other developed country.
p18
aVIn the background there
p19
aVis a very sophisticated anesthesia machine.
p20
aVAnd this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives
p21
aVbecause it was designed with this environment in mind.
p22
aVIn order to operate, this machine needs a number of things
p23
aVthat this hospital has to offer.
p24
aVIt needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist
p25
aVwith years of training with complex machines
p26
aVto help her monitor the flows of the gas
p27
aVand keep her patients safe and anesthetized
p28
aVthroughout the surgery.
p29
aVIt's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms,
p30
aVand it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running,
p31
aVand it's going to break pretty easily.
p32
aVAnd when it does, it needs a team of biomedical engineers
p33
aVwho understand its complexities, can fix it, can source the parts
p34
aVand keep it saving lives.
p35
aa(lp36
VIt's a pretty expensive machine.
p37
aVIt needs a hospital whose budget can allow it
p38
aVto support one machine costing upwards of 50 or $100,000.
p39
aVAnd perhaps most obviously,
p40
aVbut also most importantly \u2014
p41
aVand the path to concepts that we've heard about
p42
aVkind of illustrates this \u2014
p43
aVit needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity,
p44
aVof compressed oxygen, and other medical supplies
p45
aVthat are so critical to the functioning of this machine.
p46
aVIn other words, this machine requires a lot of stuff
p47
aVthat this hospital cannot offer.
p48
aa(lp49
VThis is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural Malawi.
p50
aVIn this hospital,
p51
aVthere is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia,
p52
aVand she's qualified
p53
aVbecause she has 12, maybe 18 months of training in anesthesia.
p54
aVIn the hospital and in the entire region
p55
aVthere's not a single biomedical engineer.
p56
aVSo when this machine breaks,
p57
aVthe machines that they have to work with break,
p58
aVthey've got to try and figure it out,
p59
aVbut most of the time, that's the end of the road.
p60
aVThose machines go the proverbial junkyard.
p61
aVAnd the price tag of the machine that I mentioned
p62
aVcould represent maybe a quarter or a third
p63
aVof the annual operating budget for this hospital.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd finally, I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong.
p66
aVThis hospital is connected to a very weak power grid,
p67
aVone that goes down frequently.
p68
aVSo it runs frequently, the entire hospital,
p69
aVjust on a generator.
p70
aVAnd you can imagine, the generator breaks down
p71
aVor runs out of fuel.
p72
aVAnd the World Bank sees this
p73
aVand estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low-income country
p74
aVcan expect up to 18 power outages per month.
p75
aVSimilarly, compressed oxygen and other medical supplies
p76
aVare really a luxury,
p77
aVand can often be out of stock for months or even a year.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo it seems crazy, but the model that we have right now
p80
aVis taking those machines that were designed
p81
aVfor that first environment that I showed you
p82
aVand donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment.
p83
aVIt's not just inappropriate,
p84
aVit becomes really unsafe.
p85
aa(lp86
VOne of our partners at Johns Hopkins
p87
aVwas observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago.
p88
aVAnd the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case.
p89
aVA woman came in, she needed an emergency C-section
p90
aVto save her life and the life of her baby.
p91
aVAnd everything began pretty auspiciously.
p92
aVThe surgeon was on call and scrubbed in.
p93
aVThe nurse was there.
p94
aVShe was able to anesthetize her quickly, and it was important
p95
aVbecause of the emergency nature of the situation.
p96
aVAnd everything began well
p97
aVuntil the power went out.
p98
aVAnd now in the middle of this surgery,
p99
aVthe surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case,
p100
aVwhich he can do \u2014 he's got a headlamp.
p101
aVBut the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater
p102
aVtrying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient,
p103
aVto keep her patient asleep.
p104
aVBecause her machine doesn't work when there's no power.
p105
aVThis routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced,
p106
aVand others are probably the product of, has now become a tragedy.
p107
aVAnd what's so frustrating is this is not a singular event;
p108
aVthis happens across the developing world.
p109
aV35 million surgeries are attempted every year
p110
aVwithout safe anesthesia.
p111
aa(lp112
VMy colleague, Dr. Paul Fenton, was living this reality.
p113
aVHe was the chief of anesthesiology
p114
aVin a hospital in Malawi, a teaching hospital.
p115
aVHe went to work every day
p116
aVin an operating theater like this one,
p117
aVtrying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so
p118
aVusing that same equipment
p119
aVthat became so unreliable, and frankly unsafe, in his hospital.
p120
aVAnd after umpteen surgeries
p121
aVand, you can imagine, really unspeakable tragedy,
p122
aVhe just said, "That's it. I'm done. That's enough.
p123
aVThere has to be something better."
p124
aVHe took a walk down the hall
p125
aVto where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them,
p126
aVI think that's the scientific term,
p127
aVand he started tinkering.
p128
aVHe took one part from here and another from there,
p129
aVand he tried to come up with a machine that would work
p130
aVin the reality that he was facing.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd what he came up with:
p133
aVwas this guy.
p134
aVThe prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine \u2014
p135
aVa machine that would work and anesthetize his patients
p136
aVno matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer.
p137
aVHere it is, back at home
p138
aVat that same hospital, developed a little further, 12 years later,
p139
aVworking on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics.
p140
aa(lp141
VLet me show you a little bit about how this machine works.
p142
aVVoila!
p143
aVHere she is.
p144
aVWhen you have electricity,
p145
aVeverything in this machine begins in the base.
p146
aVThere's a built-in oxygen concentrator down there.
p147
aVNow you've heard me mention oxygen a few times at this point.
p148
aVEssentially, to deliver anesthesia, you want as pure oxygen as possible,
p149
aVbecause eventually you're going to dilute it, essentially, with the gas.
p150
aVAnd the mixture that the patient inhales
p151
aVneeds to be at least a certain percentage oxygen
p152
aVor else it can become dangerous.
p153
aVBut so in here when there's electricity,
p154
aVthe oxygen concentrator takes in room air.
p155
aVNow we know room air is gloriously free,
p156
aVit is abundant,
p157
aVand it's already 21 percent oxygen.
p158
aVSo all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it
p159
aVand send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here,
p160
aVwhere it mixes with the anesthetic agent.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow before that mixture hits the patient's lungs,
p163
aVit's going to pass by here \u2014 you can't see it,
p164
aVbut there's an oxygen sensor here \u2014
p165
aVthat's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered.
p166
aVNow if you don't have power,
p167
aVor, God forbid, the power cuts out in the middle of a surgery,
p168
aVthis machine transitions automatically,
p169
aVwithout even having to touch it,
p170
aVto drawing in room air from this inlet.
p171
aa(lp172
VEverything else is the same.
p173
aVThe only difference is that now
p174
aVyou're only working with 21 percent oxygen.
p175
aVNow that used to be a dangerous guessing game,
p176
aVbecause you only knew if you gave too little oxygen
p177
aVonce something bad happened.
p178
aVBut we've put a long-life battery backup on here.
p179
aVThis is the only part that's battery backed up.
p180
aVBut this gives control to the provider, whether there's power or not,
p181
aVbecause they can adjust the flows
p182
aVbased on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving the patient.
p183
aa(lp184
VIn both cases, whether you have power or not,
p185
aVsometimes the patient needs help breathing.
p186
aVIt's just a reality of anesthesia, the lungs can be paralyzed.
p187
aVAnd so we've just added this manual bellows.
p188
aVWe've seen surgeries for three or four hours
p189
aVto ventilate the patient on this.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo it's a straightforward machine.
p192
aVI shudder to say simple; it's straightforward.
p193
aVAnd it's by design.
p194
aVYou do not need to be a highly trained, specialized anesthesiologist
p195
aVto use this machine,
p196
aVwhich is good because, in these rural district hospitals,
p197
aVyou're not going to get that level of training.
p198
aVIt's also designed for the environment that it will be used in.
p199
aa(lp200
VThis is an incredibly rugged machine.
p201
aVIt has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear
p202
aVthat happens in hospitals in these rural districts.
p203
aVAnd so it's not going to break very easily,
p204
aVbut if it does, virtually every piece in this machine
p205
aVcan be swapped out and replaced
p206
aVwith a hex wrench and a screwdriver.
p207
aVAnd finally, it's affordable.
p208
aVThis machine comes in at an eighth of the cost
p209
aVof the conventional machine that I showed you earlier.
p210
aVSo in other words, what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery
p211
aVand save lives,
p212
aVbecause it was designed for its environment,
p213
aVjust like the first machine I showed you.
p214
aa(lp215
VBut we're not content to stop there.
p216
aVIs it working?
p217
aVIs this the design that's going to work in place?
p218
aVWell, we've seen good results so far.
p219
aVThis is in 13 hospitals in four countries,
p220
aVand since 2010, we've done well over 2,000 surgeries
p221
aVwith no clinically adverse events.
p222
aVSo we're thrilled.
p223
aVThis really seems like a cost-effective, scalable solution
p224
aVto a problem that's really pervasive.
p225
aVBut we still want to be sure
p226
aVthat this is the most effective and safe device
p227
aVthat we can be putting into hospitals.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo to do that, we've launched a number of partnerships
p230
aVwith NGOs and universities,
p231
aVto gather data on the user interface,
p232
aVon the types of surgeries it's appropriate for,
p233
aVand ways we can enhance the device itself.
p234
aVOne of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins
p235
aVjust here in Baltimore.
p236
aVThey have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore.
p237
aVSo we're taking this machine
p238
aVand recreating some of the operating theater crises
p239
aVthat this machine might face
p240
aVin one of the hospitals that it's intended for,
p241
aVand in a contained, safe environment,
p242
aVevaluating its effectiveness.
p243
aVWe're then able to compare the results from that study
p244
aVwith real-world experience,
p245
aVbecause we're putting two of these in hospitals
p246
aVthat Johns Hopkins works with in Sierra Leone,
p247
aVincluding the hospital where that emergency C-section happened.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo I've talked a lot about anesthesia, and I tend to do that.
p250
aVI think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health.
p251
aVAnd it really seems peripheral, we never think about it,
p252
aVuntil we don't have access to it,
p253
aVand then it becomes a gatekeeper.
p254
aVWho gets surgery and who doesn't?
p255
aVWho gets safe surgery and who doesn't?
p256
aVBut you know, it's just one of so many ways
p257
aVthat design, appropriate design,
p258
aVcan have an impact on health outcomes.
p259
aVIf more people in the health-delivery space
p260
aVreally working on some of these challenges in low-income countries
p261
aVcould start their design process, their solution search,
p262
aVfrom outside of that proverbial box
p263
aVand inside of the hospital \u2014
p264
aVIn other words, if we could design
p265
aVfor the environment that exists in so many parts of the world,
p266
aVrather than the one that we wished existed \u2014
p267
aVwe might just save a lot of lives.
p268
aa(lp269
VThank you very much.

VI live and work from Tokyo, Japan.
p5
aVAnd I specialize in human behavioral research,
p6
aVand applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways,
p7
aVand to design for that future.
p8
aVAnd you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years,
p9
aVand I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.
p10
aVBut I've got a pretty good idea
p11
aVhow people will behave when they get there.
p12
aa(lp13
VThis is my office. It's out there.
p14
aVIt's not in the lab,
p15
aVand it's increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.
p16
aVWe live on a planet \u2014 6.3 billion people.
p17
aVAbout three billion people, by the end of this year,
p18
aVwill have cellular connectivity.
p19
aVAnd it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.
p20
aVAnd I mention this because,
p21
aVif we want to design for that future,
p22
aVwe need to figure out what those people are about.
p23
aVAnd that's, kind of, where I see what my job is
p24
aVand what our team's job is.
p25
aa(lp26
VOur research often starts with a very simple question.
p27
aVSo I'll give you an example. What do you carry?
p28
aVIf you think of everything in your life that you own,
p29
aVwhen you walk out that door,
p30
aVwhat do you consider to take with you?
p31
aVWhen you're looking around, what do you consider?
p32
aVOf that stuff, what do you carry?
p33
aVAnd of that stuff, what do you actually use?
p34
aa(lp35
VSo this is interesting to us,
p36
aVbecause the conscious and subconscious decision process
p37
aVimplies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using
p38
aVhas some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.
p39
aVAnd to put it really bluntly, you know,
p40
aVpeople are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?
p41
aVSo I've probably done about five years' research
p42
aVlooking at what people carry.
p43
aVI go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.
p44
aVI go in their homes. And we do this worldwide,
p45
aVand we follow them around town with video cameras.
p46
aVIt's kind of like stalking with permission.
p47
aVAnd we do all this \u2014 and to go back to the original question,
p48
aVwhat do people carry?
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.
p51
aVOK, that's fair enough.
p52
aVBut if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are \u2014
p53
aVacross cultures and across gender and across contexts \u2014
p54
aVmost people will say keys, money
p55
aVand, if they own one, a mobile phone.
p56
aVAnd I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?
p57
aVI mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.
p58
aVYou'd probably kick me out, or something.
p59
aVOK, it might seem like an obvious thing
p60
aVfor someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.
p61
aVBut really, the question is, why? Right?
p62
aVSo why are these things so important in our lives?
p63
aVAnd it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival \u2014
p64
aVsurvival for us and survival for our loved ones.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth \u2014
p67
aVtransport as well, in the U.S. increasingly.
p68
aVMoney is useful for buying food, sustenance,
p69
aVamong all its other uses.
p70
aVAnd a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.
p71
aVIf you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
p72
aVthose three objects are very good at supporting
p73
aVthe lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
p74
aVYes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff,
p75
aVbut they're very good at this.
p76
aVAnd in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability
p77
aVto allow people to transcend space and time.
p78
aVAnd what I mean by that is, you know,
p79
aVyou can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?
p80
aVAnd you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience,
p81
aVand someone else can pick it up at their convenience.
p82
aVAnd this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out,
p83
aVwhich is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.
p84
aVAnd they value that connectivity.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.
p87
aVAnd you can do them with phone kiosks.
p88
aVAnd the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal \u2014
p89
aVand so it also gives you a degree of privacy \u2014 and it's convenient.
p90
aVYou don't need to ask permission from anyone,
p91
aVyou can just go ahead and do it, right?
p92
aVHowever, for these things to help us survive,
p93
aVit depends on them being carried.
p94
aVBut \u2014 and it's a pretty big but \u2014 we forget.
p95
aVWe're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.
p96
aVI think, quite a nice feature.
p97
aVSo we forget, but we're also adaptable,
p98
aVand we adapt to situations around us pretty well.
p99
aVAnd so we have these strategies to remember,
p100
aVand one of them was mentioned yesterday.
p101
aVAnd it's, quite simply, the point of reflection.
p102
aVAnd that's that moment when you're walking out of a space,
p103
aVand you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.
p104
aVEven women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.
p105
aVAnd you turn around, and you look back into the space,
p106
aVand some people talk aloud.
p107
aVAnd pretty much everyone does it at some point.
p108
aa(lp109
VOK, the next thing is \u2014 most of you, if you have a stable home life,
p110
aVand what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels,
p111
aVbut most people have what we call a center of gravity.
p112
aVAnd a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.
p113
aVAnd these things don't stay in the center of gravity,
p114
aVbut over time, they gravitate there.
p115
aVIt's where you expect to find stuff.
p116
aVAnd in fact, when you're turning around,
p117
aVand you're looking inside the house,
p118
aVand you're looking for this stuff,
p119
aVthis is where you look first, right?
p120
aVOK, so when we did this research,
p121
aVwe found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way
p122
aVto never forget anything ever, ever again.
p123
aVAnd that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VOK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?
p127
aVBut is, in fact, about the art of delegation.
p128
aVAnd from a design perspective,
p129
aVit's about understanding what you can delegate to technology
p130
aVand what you can delegate to other people.
p131
aVAnd it turns out, delegation \u2014 if you want it to be \u2014
p132
aVcan be the solution for pretty much everything,
p133
aVapart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.
p134
aVYou can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.
p135
aVAnd apart from things like entertainment,
p136
aVyou wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf,
p137
aVor, at least, not yet.
p138
aVMaybe sometime in the future, we will.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.
p141
aVSo this is \u2014 probably the thing I'm most passionate about
p142
aVis the research that we've been doing on illiteracy
p143
aVand how people who are illiterate communicate.
p144
aVSo, the U.N. estimated \u2014 this is 2004 figures \u2014
p145
aVthat there are almost 800 million people who can't read and write, worldwide.
p146
aVSo, we've been conducting a lot of research.
p147
aVAnd one of the things we were looking at is \u2014
p148
aVif you can't read and write,
p149
aVif you want to communicate over distances,
p150
aVyou need to be able to identify the person
p151
aVthat you want to communicate with.
p152
aVIt could be a phone number, it could be an e-mail address,
p153
aVit could be a postal address.
p154
aVSimple question: if you can't read and write,
p155
aVhow do you manage your contact information?
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd the fact is that millions of people do it.
p158
aVJust from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it,
p159
aVand so that's just one small example
p160
aVof the kind of research that we were doing.
p161
aVAnd it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.
p162
aVSo they delegate that part of the task process to other people,
p163
aVthe stuff that they can't do themselves.
p164
aVLet me give you another example of delegation.
p165
aVThis one's a little bit more sophisticated,
p166
aVand this is from a study that we did in Uganda
p167
aVabout how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.
p168
aVSente is a word in Uganda that means money.
p169
aVIt has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime. OK?
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd it works like this.
p172
aVSo let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village.
p173
aVI'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.
p174
aVI'm sending money back, and it works like this.
p175
aVSo, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone,
p176
aVand that's the phone kiosk operator.
p177
aVAnd it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.
p178
aVSo what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.
p179
aVAnd instead of using that money to top up my own phone,
p180
aVI call up the local village operator.
p181
aVAnd I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.
p182
aVSo, they're topping up the value from Kampala,
p183
aVand it's now being topped up in the village.
p184
aVYou take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you \u2014
p185
aVthe kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission,
p186
aVand passes the rest over to you in cash.
p187
aa(lp188
VOK, there's two things I like about this.
p189
aVSo the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone \u2014
p190
aVanyone who has a mobile phone \u2014
p191
aVessentially into an ATM machine.
p192
aVIt brings rudimentary banking services to places
p193
aVwhere there's no banking infrastructure.
p194
aVAnd even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure,
p195
aVthey wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers,
p196
aVbecause they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.
p197
aVThere's a second thing I like about this.
p198
aVAnd that is that despite all the resources at my disposal,
p199
aVand despite all our kind of apparent sophistication,
p200
aVI know I could never have designed something as elegant
p201
aVand as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK?
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd, yes, there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.
p204
aVBut the difference between this and that
p205
aVis, there's no central authority trying to control this.
p206
aVThis is just street-up innovation.
p207
aVSo, it turns out the street is a never-ending source of
p208
aVinspiration for us.
p209
aVAnd OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.
p210
aVThey'll give you a new one.
p211
aVThey'll probably give you three new ones, right?
p212
aVI mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.
p213
aVIf you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.
p214
aVAnd this is where they take the stuff that breaks,
p215
aVand they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.
p216
aa(lp217
VThis is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China,
p218
aVand you can see people taking down a phone
p219
aVand putting it back together.
p220
aVThey reverse-engineer manuals.
p221
aVThis is a kind of hacker's manual,
p222
aVand it's written in Chinese and English.
p223
aVThey also write them in Hindi.
p224
aVYou can subscribe to these.
p225
aVThere are training institutes where they're churning out people
p226
aVfor fixing these things as well.
p227
aVBut what I like about this is,
p228
aVit boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface,
p229
aVa screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads \u2014
p230
aVbecause they often get dust on the contact heads \u2014 and knowledge.
p231
aVAnd it's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.
p232
aVAnd I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff,
p233
aVand build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.
p234
aVIt challenges the norms.
p235
aa(lp236
VOK, for me the street just raises so many different questions.
p237
aVLike, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.
p238
aVAnd China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.
p239
aVAnd I know what you're asking \u2014 did I test it?
p240
aVI'm not going to answer that, OK.
p241
aVBut I look at something like this, and I consider the implications
p242
aVof trust and confidence in the purchase process.
p243
aVAnd we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply,
p244
aVfor example, for the design of \u2014 the lessons from this \u2014
p245
aVapply to the design of online services, future services in these markets?
p246
aa(lp247
VThis is a pair of underpants from \u2014
p248
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p249
aVfrom Tibet.
p250
aVAnd I look at something like this, and honestly, you know,
p251
aVwhy would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?
p252
aVAnd I look at something like this and it makes me question,
p253
aVif we were to take all the functionality in things like this,
p254
aVand redistribute them around the body
p255
aVin some kind of personal area network,
p256
aVhow would we prioritize where to put stuff?
p257
aVAnd yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that
p258
aVkind of personal area networks.
p259
aVAnd what you see here is a couple of phone numbers
p260
aVwritten above the shack in rural Uganda.
p261
aVThis doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers.
p262
aVSo what does it mean when people's identity is mobile?
p263
aVWhen those extra three billion people's identity is mobile, it isn't fixed?
p264
aVYour notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK,
p265
aVfor those extra three billion people.
p266
aVThis is how it's shifting.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd then I go to this picture here, which is the one that I started with.
p269
aVAnd this is from Delhi.
p270
aVIt's from a study we did into illiteracy,
p271
aVand it's a guy in a teashop.
p272
aVYou can see the chai being poured in the background.
p273
aVAnd he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker,
p274
aVon the lowest rungs in the society.
p275
aVAnd he, somehow, has the appreciation
p276
aVof the values of Livestrong.
p277
aVAnd it's not necessarily the same values,
p278
aVbut some kind of values of Livestrong,
p279
aVto actually go out and purchase them,
p280
aVand actually display them.
p281
aa(lp282
VFor me, this kind of personifies this connected world,
p283
aVwhere everything is intertwined, and the dots are \u2014
p284
aVit's all about the dots joining together.
p285
aVOK, the title of this presentation is "Connections and Consequences,"
p286
aVand it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out
p287
aVwhat it's going to be like when everyone on the planet
p288
aVhas the ability to transcend space and time
p289
aVin a personal and convenient manner, right?
p290
aVWhen everyone's connected.
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd there are four things.
p293
aVSo, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas,
p294
aVthe speed at which ideas go around.
p295
aVAnd I know TED is about big ideas,
p296
aVbut actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.
p297
aVIf you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet,
p298
aVthat's the first thing.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe second thing is the immediacy of objects.
p301
aVAnd what I mean by that is, as these become smaller,
p302
aVas the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater \u2014
p303
aVthings like banking, identity \u2014
p304
aVthese things quite simply move very quickly around the world.
p305
aVAnd so the speed of the adoption of things
p306
aVis just going to become that much more rapid,
p307
aVin a way that we just totally cannot conceive,
p308
aVwhen you get it to 6.3 billion
p309
aVand the growth in the world's population.
p310
aa(lp311
VThe next thing is that, however we design this stuff \u2014
p312
aVcarefully design this stuff \u2014
p313
aVthe street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate,
p314
aVas long as it meets base needs \u2014
p315
aVthe ability to transcend space and time, for example.
p316
aVAnd it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.
p317
aVIn ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.
p318
aVThat's my feeling.
p319
aVAnd if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on,
p320
aVand we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse
p321
aVboth what we design and how we design.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd the last thing is that \u2014 actually, the direction of the conversation.
p324
aVWith another three billion people connected,
p325
aVthey want to be part of the conversation.
p326
aVAnd I think our relevance and TED's relevance
p327
aVis really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.
p328
aVAnd we need to learn how to listen.
p329
aVSo thank you very, very much.

VI'm here to talk to you today
p5
aVabout a story that we have all been conditioned to believe
p6
aVis not possible.
p7
aVIt's a story about a living, breathing start-up
p8
aVflourishing in an unlikely environment:
p9
aVthe United States government.
p10
aVNow, this start-up is fundamentally beginning to disrupt
p11
aVthe way government does business from the inside out.
p12
aVBut before I get there, let's start with the problem.
p13
aa(lp14
VFor me, the problem begins with a number: 137.
p15
aV137 is the average number of days
p16
aVa veteran has to wait to have benefits processed by the VA.
p17
aV137 days.
p18
aVNow, in order to file that application in the first place,
p19
aVshe has to navigate over 1,000 different websites
p20
aVand over 900 different call-in numbers,
p21
aVall owned and operated by the United States government.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, we live in times of incredible change.
p24
aVThe private sector is constantly changing
p25
aVand improving itself all the time.
p26
aVFor that matter, it's removing every single inconvenience in my life
p27
aVthat I could possibly think of.
p28
aVI could be sitting on my couch in my apartment,
p29
aVand from my phone, I can order a warm, gluten-free meal
p30
aVthat can arrive at my door in less than 10 minutes.
p31
aVBut meanwhile, a working mother who depends on food stamps
p32
aVto support her family
p33
aVhas to complete an arduous, complicated application
p34
aVwhich she might not even be able to do online.
p35
aVAnd the inability of her to do that same work from her couch means
p36
aVthat she might be having to take days or hours off of work
p37
aVthat she can't spare.
p38
aVAnd this growing dichotomy
p39
aVbetween the beneficiaries of the tech revolution
p40
aVand those it's left behind
p41
aVis one of the greatest challenges of our time \u2014
p42
aa(lp43
V(Applause)
p44
aa(lp45
VBecause government's failure to deliver digital services that work
p46
aVis disproportionately impacting the very people who need it most.
p47
aVIt's impacting the students trying to go to college,
p48
aVthe single mothers trying to get health care,
p49
aVthe veterans coming home from battle.
p50
aVThey can't get what they need when they need it.
p51
aVAnd for these Americans,
p52
aVgovernment is more than just a presidential election every four years.
p53
aVGovernment is a lifeline that provides services they need
p54
aVand depend on and deserve.
p55
aVWhich is, quite frankly,
p56
aVwhy government needs to get its shit together and catch up.
p57
aVJust saying.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, this wasn't always a problem I was passionate about.
p62
aVWhen I joined President Obama's campaign in 2008,
p63
aVwe brought the tech industry's best practices into politics.
p64
aVWe earned more money,
p65
aVwe engaged more volunteers
p66
aVand we earned more votes than any political campaign in history.
p67
aVWe were a cutting-edge start-up that changed the game of politics forever.
p68
aVSo when the President asked a small group of us
p69
aVto bring that very same disruption directly into government,
p70
aVI knew it wasn't going to be easy work,
p71
aVbut I was eager and showed up ready to get to work.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, on my first day in DC,
p74
aVmy first day in government,
p75
aVI walked into the office and they handed me a laptop.
p76
aVAnd the laptop was running Windows 98.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VI mean, three entire presidential elections had come and gone
p81
aVsince the government had updated the operating system on that computer.
p82
aVThree elections!
p83
aVWhich is when we realized
p84
aVthis problem was a whole lot bigger than we ever could have imagined.
p85
aVLet me paint the picture for you.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe federal government is the largest institution in the world.
p88
aVIt spends over 86 billion dollars a year \u2014 86 billion \u2014
p89
aVon federal IT projects.
p90
aVFor context:
p91
aVthat is more than the entire venture capital industry spends
p92
aVannually \u2014 on everything.
p93
aVNow, the problem here
p94
aVis that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for,
p95
aVbecause 94 percent of federal IT projects
p96
aVare over budget or behind schedule.
p97
aV94 percent!
p98
aVFor those of you keeping score,
p99
aVyes, the number 94 is very close to 100.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VThere's another problem:
p104
aV40 percent of those never end up seeing the light of day.
p105
aVThey are completely scrapped or abandoned.
p106
aVNow, this is a very existentially painful moment for any organization,
p107
aVbecause it means as government continues to operate
p108
aVas it's programmed to do,
p109
aVfailure is nearly inevitable.
p110
aVAnd when the status quo is the riskiest option,
p111
aVthat means there is simply no other choice
p112
aVthan radical disruption.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo, what do we do about it?
p115
aVHow do we fix this?
p116
aVWell, the irony of all of this
p117
aVis that we actually don't have to look any further than our backyard,
p118
aVbecause right here in America are the very ideas, the very people,
p119
aVwho have swept our world into a radically different place
p120
aVthan it was two decades ago.
p121
aVSo what would it look like
p122
aVif it was actually as easy to get student loans or veterans' benefits
p123
aVas it is to order cat food to my house?
p124
aVWhat would it look like
p125
aVif there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators
p126
aVwho have disrupted our tech sector
p127
aVto come and disrupt their government?
p128
aa(lp129
VWell, my friends, here's where we get to talk
p130
aVabout some of the exciting new formulas we've discovered
p131
aVfor creating change in government.
p132
aVEnter the United States Digital Service.
p133
aVThe United States Digital Service is a new network of start-ups,
p134
aVa team of teams,
p135
aVorganizing themselves across government to create radical change.
p136
aVThe mission of the United States Digital Service is to help government
p137
aVdeliver world-class digital services
p138
aVfor students, immigrants, children, the elderly \u2014 everybody \u2014
p139
aVat dramatically lower costs.
p140
aVWe are essentially trying to build a more awesome government,
p141
aVfor the people, by the people, today.
p142
aVWe don't care \u2014 (Applause) Thank you.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Applause)
p145
aa(lp146
VWho doesn't want a more awesome government, right?
p147
aa(lp148
VWe don't care about politics.
p149
aVWe care about making government work better,
p150
aVbecause it's the only one we've got.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, you can think of our team \u2014 well, it's pretty funny \u2014
p155
aVyou can think of our team a little bit like
p156
aVthe Peace Corps meets DARPA meets SEAL Team 6.
p157
aVWe're like the Peace Corps for nerds,
p158
aVbut instead of traveling to crazy, interesting, far-off places,
p159
aVyou spend a lot of time indoors, behind computers,
p160
aVhelping restore the fabric of our democracy.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, this team \u2014 our playbook for the United States Digital Service
p165
aVis pretty simple.
p166
aVThe first play is we recruit the very best talent
p167
aVour country has to offer,
p168
aVand recruit them for short tours of duty inside government.
p169
aVThese are the very people who have helped build the products and companies
p170
aVthat have made our tech sector amongst the most innovative in the world.
p171
aVSecond, we pair these incredible people from the tech core
p172
aVwith the dedicated civil servants already inside government
p173
aVon the ground creating change.
p174
aVThird, we strategically deploy them in a targeted formation
p175
aVat the most mission-critical, life-changing, important services
p176
aVthat government offers.
p177
aVAnd finally, we give them massive air cover,
p178
aVfrom the leadership inside the agencies
p179
aVall the way up to the President himself,
p180
aVto transform these services for the better.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, this team is beginning to disrupt
p183
aVhow government does business from the inside out.
p184
aVIf you study classic patterns of disruption,
p185
aVone very common pattern is rather simple.
p186
aVIt's to take something that has become routine and standard in one industry
p187
aVand apply it to another where it's a radical departure
p188
aVfrom the status quo.
p189
aVThink about what Airbnb took that was normal from hospitality
p190
aVand revolutionized my apartment.
p191
aVThe United States Digital Service is doing exactly that.
p192
aVWe are taking what Silicon Valley and the private sector has learned
p193
aVthrough a ton of hard work
p194
aVabout how to build planetary-scale digital services
p195
aVthat delight users at lower cost,
p196
aVand we're applying that to government,
p197
aVwhere it is a radical departure from the status quo.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, the good news is:
p200
aVit's starting to work.
p201
aVWe know this because we can already see the results
p202
aVfrom some of our early projects, like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov,
p203
aVwhen that went off the rails.
p204
aVFixing Healthcare.gov was the first place that we ran this play,
p205
aVand today we are taking that same play
p206
aVand scaling it across a large number
p207
aVof government's most important citizen-facing services.
p208
aVNow, if I can take a moment
p209
aVand brag about the team for a second \u2014
p210
aVit is the highest concentration of badasses
p211
aVI could have ever dreamed of.
p212
aVWe have top talent from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes,
p213
aVall on staff today,
p214
aVall choosing to join their government.
p215
aVAnd what's incredible is,
p216
aVeverybody is as eager and kind as they are intelligent.
p217
aVAnd I might add, by the way, over half of us are women.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VThe best way to understand this strategy
p222
aVis actually to walk through a couple of examples
p223
aVof how it's working out in the wild.
p224
aVI'm going to give you two examples quickly.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe first one is about immigration.
p227
aVThis, my friends, is your typical immigration application.
p228
aVYes, you guessed it \u2014
p229
aVit's almost entirely paper-based.
p230
aVIn the best case,
p231
aVthe application takes about six to eight months to process.
p232
aVIt is physically shipped thousands of miles \u2014 thousands of miles! \u2014
p233
aVbetween no less than six processing centers.
p234
aVNow, little story:
p235
aVabout a decade ago,
p236
aVthe government thought that if it brought this system online,
p237
aVit could save taxpayer dollars and provide a better service,
p238
aVwhich was a great idea.
p239
aVSo, the typical government process began.
p240
aVSix years and 1.2 billion dollars later,
p241
aVno working product was delivered \u2014
p242
aV1.2 billion with a "B."
p243
aVNow at this point, the agency responsible,
p244
aVUS Citizenship and Immigration Services,
p245
aVcould have kept pouring money into the failing program.
p246
aVSadly, that's what often happens.
p247
aVThat's the status quo today.
p248
aVBut they didn't.
p249
aVThe dedicated civil servants inside the agency
p250
aVdecided to stand up and call for change.
p251
aVWe deployed a small team of just six people,
p252
aVand what many people don't know is
p253
aVthat's the same size as the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov \u2014
p254
aVjust six people.
p255
aVAnd that team jumped in, side-by-side,
p256
aVto support the agency in transitioning this project
p257
aVinto more modern business practices, more modern development practices.
p258
aVNow, in non-tech speak,
p259
aVwhat that basically means is taking big, multi-year projects
p260
aVand breaking them up into bite-sized chunks,
p261
aVso that way we can reduce the risk
p262
aVand actually start to see results every couple of weeks,
p263
aVinstead of waiting in a black box for years.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo within less than three months of our team being on the ground,
p266
aVwe were already able to push our first products to production.
p267
aVThe first one, this is the form I-90.
p268
aVThis is used to file for your replacement green card.
p269
aVNow, for immigrant visa holders,
p270
aVa replacement green card is a big deal.
p271
aVYour green card is your proof of identification,
p272
aVit's your work authorization,
p273
aVit's the proof that you can be here in this country.
p274
aVSo waiting six months while the government processes the replacement
p275
aVis not cool.
p276
aVI'm excited to tell you that today,
p277
aVyou can now, for the first time, file for a replacement green card
p278
aVentirely online without anyone touching a piece of paper.
p279
aVIt is faster, it is cheaper,
p280
aVand it's a better user experience for the applicant
p281
aVand the government employees alike.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Applause)
p284
aa(lp285
VAnother one, quickly.
p286
aVLast fall, we just released a brand-new practice civics test.
p287
aVSo as part of becoming a US citizen,
p288
aVyou have to pass a civics test.
p289
aVFor anyone who has taken this test, it can be quite the stressful process.
p290
aVSo our team released a very easy, simple-to-use tool in plain language
p291
aVto help people prepare,
p292
aVto help ease their nerves,
p293
aVto help them feel more confident
p294
aVin taking the next step in pursuing their American dream.
p295
aVBecause all of this work, all of this work on immigration,
p296
aVis about taking complicated processes and making them more human.
p297
aa(lp298
VThe other day, one of the dedicated civil servants on the ground
p299
aVsaid something incredibly profound.
p300
aVShe said that she's never been this hopeful or optimistic
p301
aVabout a project in her entire time in government.
p302
aVAnd she's been doing this for 30 years.
p303
aVThat is exactly the kind of hope and culture change
p304
aVwe are trying to create.
p305
aa(lp306
VFor my second example, I want to bring it back to veterans for a second,
p307
aVand what we are doing to build them a VA
p308
aVthat is worthy of their service and their sacrifice.
p309
aVI'm proud to say that just a few months ago,
p310
aVwe released a brand-new beta
p311
aVof a new website, Vets.gov.
p312
aVVets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website
p313
aVthat brings all of the online services a veteran needs into one place.
p314
aVOne website, not thousands.
p315
aVThe site is a work in progress, but it's significant progress,
p316
aVbecause it's designed with the users who matter most:
p317
aVthe veterans themselves.
p318
aVThis might sound incredibly obvious, because it should be,
p319
aVbut sadly, this isn't normal for government.
p320
aVFar too often, product decisions are made by committees of stakeholders
p321
aVwho do their best to represent the interests of the user,
p322
aVbut they're not necessarily the users themselves.
p323
aVSo our team at the VA went out, we looked at the data,
p324
aVwe talked to veterans themselves
p325
aVand we started simple and small,
p326
aVwith the two most important services that matter most to them:
p327
aVeducation benefits and disability benefits.
p328
aVI'm proud to say that they are live on the site today,
p329
aVand as the team continues to streamline more services,
p330
aVthey will be ported over here, and the old sites, shut down.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Applause)
p333
aa(lp334
VTo me, this is what change looks like in 2016.
p335
aa(lp336
VWhen you walk out of the Oval Office,
p337
aVthe first time I was ever there, I noticed a quote
p338
aVthe President had embroidered on the rug.
p339
aVIt's the classic JFK quote.
p340
aVIt says, "No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings."
p341
aVIt's true.
p342
aVWe have the tools to solve these problems.
p343
aVWe have the tools to come together as a society, as a country,
p344
aVand to fix this together.
p345
aVYes, it's hard.
p346
aVIt's particularly hard when we have to fight,
p347
aVwhen we have to refuse to succumb to the belief that things won't change.
p348
aVBut in my experience,
p349
aVit's often the hardest things that are the most worth doing,
p350
aVbecause if we don't do them,
p351
aVwho will?
p352
aVThis is on us,
p353
aVall of us, together,
p354
aVbecause government is not an abstract institution or a concept.
p355
aVOur government is us.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
VToday, it is no longer a question
p360
aVof if change is possible.
p361
aVThe question is not, "Can we?"
p362
aVThe question is, "Will we?"
p363
aa(lp364
VWill you?
p365
aa(lp366
VThank you.
p367
aa(lp368
V(Applause)
p369
aa(lp370
VThank you.

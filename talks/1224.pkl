VI want to say that really and truly,
p5
aVafter these incredible speeches
p6
aVand ideas that are being spread,
p7
aVI am in the awkward position
p8
aVof being here to talk to you today
p9
aVabout television.
p10
aVSo most everyone watches TV.
p11
aVWe like it. We like some parts of it.
p12
aVHere in America, people actually love TV.
p13
aVThe average American watches TV
p14
aVfor almost 5 hours a day.
p15
aVOkay?
p16
aVNow I happen to make my living these days in television,
p17
aVso for me, that's a good thing.
p18
aVBut a lot of people don't love it so much.
p19
aVThey, in fact, berate it.
p20
aVThey call it stupid,
p21
aVand worse, believe me.
p22
aVMy mother, growing up,
p23
aVshe called it the "idiot box."
p24
aa(lp25
VBut my idea today is not to debate
p26
aVwhether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV;
p27
aVmy idea today
p28
aVis to tell you that I believe
p29
aVtelevision has a conscience.
p30
aVSo why I believe that television has a conscience
p31
aVis that I actually believe
p32
aVthat television directly reflects
p33
aVthe moral, political,
p34
aVsocial and emotional need states of our nation \u2014
p35
aVthat television is how we actually disseminate
p36
aVour entire value system.
p37
aVSo all these things are uniquely human,
p38
aVand they all add up
p39
aVto our idea of conscience.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.
p42
aVWe're talking about popular TV.
p43
aVWe're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows
p44
aVover the course of 50 years.
p45
aVHow do these Nielsen ratings
p46
aVreflect not just what you've heard about,
p47
aVwhich is the idea of our social, collective unconscious,
p48
aVbut how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows
p49
aVover 50 years
p50
aVreflect the idea
p51
aVof our social conscience?
p52
aVHow does television evolve over time,
p53
aVand what does this say about our society?
p54
aa(lp55
VNow speaking of evolution,
p56
aVfrom basic biology, you probably remember
p57
aVthat the animal kingdom, including humans,
p58
aVhave four basic primal instincts.
p59
aVYou have hunger; you have sex; you have power;
p60
aVand you have the urge for acquisitiveness.
p61
aVAs humans, what's important to remember
p62
aVis that we've developed, we've evolved over time
p63
aVto temper, or tame,
p64
aVthese basic animal instincts.
p65
aVWe have the capacity to laugh and cry.
p66
aVWe feel awe, we feel pity.
p67
aVThat is separate and apart
p68
aVfrom the animal kingdom.
p69
aVThe other thing about human beings
p70
aVis that we love to be entertained.
p71
aVWe love to watch TV.
p72
aVThis is something that clearly separates us
p73
aVfrom the animal kingdom.
p74
aVAnimals might love to play,
p75
aVbut they don't love to watch.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo I had an ambition
p78
aVto discover what could be understood
p79
aVfrom this uniquely human relationship
p80
aVbetween television programs
p81
aVand the human conscious.
p82
aVWhy has television entertainment evolved the way it has?
p83
aVI kind of think of it
p84
aVas this cartoon devil or angel
p85
aVsitting on our shoulders.
p86
aVIs television literally functioning
p87
aVas our conscience,
p88
aVtempting us and rewarding us at the same time?
p89
aa(lp90
VSo to begin to answer these questions,
p91
aVwe did a research study.
p92
aVWe went back 50 years
p93
aVto the 1959/1960 television season.
p94
aVWe surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows
p95
aVevery year for 50 years \u2014
p96
aVa thousand shows.
p97
aVWe talked to over 3,000 individuals \u2014
p98
aValmost 3,600 \u2014
p99
aVaged 18 to 70,
p100
aVand we asked them how they felt emotionally.
p101
aVHow did you feel
p102
aVwatching every single one of these shows?
p103
aVDid you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?
p104
aVDid you feel outrage? Did you laugh?
p105
aVWhat did this mean for you?
p106
aVSo to our global TED audiences,
p107
aVI want to say that this was a U.S. sample.
p108
aVBut as you can see,
p109
aVthese emotional need states are truly universal.
p110
aVAnd on a factual basis,
p111
aVover 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows
p112
aVare exported around the world.
p113
aVSo I really hope our global audiences
p114
aVcan relate.
p115
aa(lp116
VTwo acknowledgments
p117
aVbefore our first data slide:
p118
aVFor inspiring me
p119
aVto even think about the idea of conscience
p120
aVand the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis,
p121
aVI thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern.
p122
aVAnd for the way in which I'm going to present the data,
p123
aVI want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling,
p124
aVwho you may have just seen.
p125
aa(lp126
VOkay, here we go.
p127
aVSo here you see,
p128
aVfrom 1960 to 2010,
p129
aVthe 50 years of our study.
p130
aVTwo things we're going to start with \u2014
p131
aVthe inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state,
p132
aVwhich, for this purpose,
p133
aVwe defined inspiration
p134
aVas television shows that uplift me,
p135
aVthat make me feel much more positive about the world.
p136
aVMoral ambiguity are televisions shows
p137
aVin which I don't understand
p138
aVthe difference between right and wrong.
p139
aVAs we start, you see in 1960
p140
aVinspiration is holding steady.
p141
aVThat's what we're watching TV for.
p142
aVMoral ambiguity starts to climb.
p143
aVRight at the end of the 60s,
p144
aVmoral ambiguity is going up,
p145
aVinspiration is kind of on the wane.
p146
aVWhy?
p147
aVThe Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot,
p148
aVthe Civil Rights movement,
p149
aVrace riots, the Vietnam War,
p150
aVMLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot,
p151
aVWatergate.
p152
aVLook what happens.
p153
aVIn 1970, inspiration plummets.
p154
aVMoral ambiguity takes off.
p155
aVThey cross,
p156
aVbut Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.
p157
aVIt's trying to recover.
p158
aVBut look, it can't:
p159
aVAIDS, Iran-Contra,
p160
aVthe Challenger disaster, Chernobyl.
p161
aVMoral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television
p162
aVfrom 1990 for the next 20 years.
p163
aa(lp164
VTake a look at this.
p165
aVThis chart is going to document a very similar trend.
p166
aVBut in this case, we have comfort \u2014 the bubble in red \u2014
p167
aVsocial commentary and irreverence
p168
aVin blue and green.
p169
aVNow this time on TV
p170
aVyou have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke,"
p171
aVyou have "Andy Griffith,"
p172
aVyou have domestic shows all about comfort.
p173
aVThis is rising. Comfort stays whole.
p174
aVIrreverence starts to rise.
p175
aVSocial commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.
p176
aVYou get to 1969, and look what happens.
p177
aVYou have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary,
p178
aVnot only battling it out in our society,
p179
aVbut you literally have two establishment shows \u2014
p180
aV"Gunsmoke" and "Gomer Pyle" \u2014
p181
aVin 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.
p182
aVWhat's number one?
p183
aVThe socially irreverent hippie show,
p184
aV"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."
p185
aVThey're all living together, right.
p186
aVViewers had responded dramatically.
p187
aa(lp188
VLook at this green spike in 1966
p189
aVto a bellwether show.
p190
aVWhen you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit,
p191
aVwhat does that mean?
p192
aVIt means in the 1966 television season,
p193
aVThe "Smothers Brothers" came out of nowhere.
p194
aVThis was the first show
p195
aVthat allowed viewers to say,
p196
aV"My God,
p197
aVI can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War,
p198
aVabout the presidency, through television?"
p199
aVThat's what we mean by a breakout show.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo then, just like the last chart, look what happens.
p202
aVIn 1970,
p203
aVthe dam bursts. The dam bursts.
p204
aVComfort is no longer why we watch television.
p205
aVSocial commentary and irreverence
p206
aVrise throughout the 70s.
p207
aVNow look at this.
p208
aVThe 70s means who? Norman Lear.
p209
aVYou have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son,"
p210
aVand the dominant show \u2014
p211
aVin the top-10 for the entire 70s \u2014
p212
aV"MAS*H."
p213
aVIn the entire 50 years
p214
aVof television that we studied,
p215
aVseven of 10 shows
p216
aVranked most highly for irreverence
p217
aVappeared on air during the Vietnam War,
p218
aVfive of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.
p219
aVOnly one generation, 20 years in,
p220
aVand we discovered,
p221
aVWow! TV can do that?
p222
aVIt can make me feel this?
p223
aVIt can change us?
p224
aVSo to this very, very savvy crowd,
p225
aVI also want to note
p226
aVthe digital folks did not invent disruptive.
p227
aVArchie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair
p228
aValong with the rest of us
p229
aV40 years ago.
p230
aa(lp231
VThis is a quick chart. Here's another attribute:
p232
aVfantasy and imagination,
p233
aVwhich are shows defined as,
p234
aV"takes me out of my everyday realm"
p235
aVand "makes me feel better."
p236
aVThat's mapped against the red dot, unemployment,
p237
aVwhich is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.
p238
aVYou'll see
p239
aVthat every time fantasy and imagination shows rise,
p240
aVit maps to a spike in unemployment.
p241
aVDo we want to see shows
p242
aVabout people saving money and being unemployed?
p243
aVNo. In the 70s
p244
aVyou have the bellwether show "The Bionic Woman"
p245
aVthat rocketed into the top-10 in 1973,
p246
aVfollowed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels."
p247
aVAnother spike in the 1980s \u2014
p248
aVanother spike in shows about control and power.
p249
aVWhat were those shows?
p250
aVGlamorous and rich.
p251
aV"Dallas," "Fantasy Island."
p252
aVIncredible mapping of our national psyche
p253
aVwith some hard and fast facts:
p254
aVunemployment.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo here you are, in my favorite chart,
p257
aVbecause this is our last 20 years.
p258
aVWhether or not you're in my business,
p259
aVyou have surely heard or read
p260
aVof the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom
p261
aVand the rise of reality TV.
p262
aVWell, as we say in the business,
p263
aVX marks the spot.
p264
aVThe 90s \u2014 the big bubbles of humor \u2014
p265
aVwe're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld."
p266
aVEverything's good, low unemployment.
p267
aVBut look: X marks the spot.
p268
aVIn 2001,
p269
aVthe September 2001 television season,
p270
aVhumor succumbs to judgment once and for all.
p271
aVWhy not?
p272
aVWe had a 2000 presidential election
p273
aVdecided by the Supreme Court.
p274
aVWe had the bursting of the tech bubble.
p275
aVWe had 9/11.
p276
aVAnthrax becomes part of the social lexicon.
p277
aVLook what happens when we keep going.
p278
aVAt the turn of the century, the Internet takes off,
p279
aVreality television has taken hold.
p280
aVWhat do people want in their TV then?
p281
aVI would have thought revenge
p282
aVor nostalgia.
p283
aVGive me some comfort; my world is falling apart.
p284
aVNo, they want judgment.
p285
aVI can vote you off the island.
p286
aVI can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.
p287
aVI can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.
p288
aVThat's all great, right?
p289
aa(lp290
VSo as dramatically different as these television shows,
p291
aVpure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years \u2014
p292
aVwhat did I start with? \u2014
p293
aVone basic instinct remains.
p294
aVWe're animals, we need our moms.
p295
aVThere has not been a decade of television
p296
aVwithout a definitive, dominant TV mom.
p297
aVThe 1950s:
p298
aVJune Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver."
p299
aVLucille Ball kept us laughing
p300
aVthrough the rise of social consciousness in the 60s.
p301
aVMaude Findlay,
p302
aVthe epitome of the irreverent 1970s,
p303
aVwho tackled abortion, divorce,
p304
aVeven menopause on TV.
p305
aVThe 1980s,
p306
aVour first cougar was given to us
p307
aVin the form of Alexis Carrington.
p308
aVMurphy Brown took on a vice president
p309
aVwhen she took on the idea of single parenthood.
p310
aVThis era's mom,
p311
aVBree Van de Kamp.
p312
aVNow I don't know if this is the devil or the angel
p313
aVsitting on our conscience,
p314
aVsitting on television's shoulders,
p315
aVbut I do know that I absolutely love this image.
p316
aa(lp317
VSo to you all,
p318
aVthe women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen,
p319
aVthe global audiences of TEDWomen,
p320
aVthank you for letting me present my idea
p321
aVabout the conscience of television.
p322
aVBut let me also thank the incredible creators
p323
aVwho get up everyday
p324
aVto put their ideas on our television screens
p325
aVthroughout all these ages of television.
p326
aVThey give it life on television, for sure,
p327
aVbut it's you as viewers,
p328
aVthrough your collective social consciences,
p329
aVthat give it life, longevity,
p330
aVpower or not.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo thanks very much.

VI write about food. I write about cooking.
p5
aVI take it quite seriously,
p6
aVbut I'm here to talk about something
p7
aVthat's become very important to me in the last year or two.
p8
aVIt is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.
p9
aVI'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.
p10
aVI'm not a vegetarian \u2014 this is the old Nixon line, right?
p11
aVBut I still think that this \u2014
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aV\u2014 may be this year's version of this.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.
p16
aVAnd why do I say it?
p17
aVBecause only once before has the fate of individual people
p18
aVand the fate of all of humanity
p19
aVbeen so intertwined.
p20
aVThere was the bomb, and there's now.
p21
aVAnd where we go from here is going to determine
p22
aVnot only the quality and the length of our individual lives,
p23
aVbut whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,
p24
aVwe'd recognize it.
p25
aVIt's a holocaust of a different kind,
p26
aVand hiding under our desks isn't going to help.
p27
aVStart with the notion that global warming
p28
aVis not only real, but dangerous.
p29
aVSince every scientist in the world now believes this,
p30
aVand even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,
p31
aVwe can take this is a given.
p32
aa(lp33
VThen hear this, please.
p34
aVAfter energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor
p35
aVto atmosphere-altering gases.
p36
aVNearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas
p37
aVis generated by livestock production \u2014
p38
aVmore than transportation.
p39
aVNow, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,
p40
aVbut methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2,
p41
aVand it's not just methane.
p42
aVLivestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation,
p43
aVair and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.
p44
aVThere's more.
p45
aVLike half the antibiotics in this country
p46
aVare not administered to people, but to animals.
p47
aVBut lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this:
p48
aVif you're a progressive,
p49
aVif you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green,
p50
aVor you're looking for organic,
p51
aVyou should probably be a semi-vegetarian.
p52
aVNow, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom,
p53
aVbut it's all in the way we use these things.
p54
aVThere's another piece of the puzzle,
p55
aVwhich Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday,
p56
aVand one you already know.
p57
aa(lp58
VThere's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases \u2014
p59
aVdiabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers \u2014
p60
aVare diseases that are far more prevalent here
p61
aVthan anywhere in the rest of the world.
p62
aVAnd that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.
p63
aVOur demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates \u2014
p64
aVthe world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day \u2014
p65
aVour demand for these things, not our need, our want,
p66
aVdrives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.
p67
aVAnd those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.
p68
aVNow global warming was unforeseen.
p69
aVWe didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.
p70
aVMaybe a few lung diseases here and there,
p71
aVbut, you know, that's not such a big deal.
p72
aVThe current health crisis, however,
p73
aVis a little more the work of the evil empire.
p74
aVWe were told, we were assured,
p75
aVthat the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate,
p76
aVthe healthier we'd be.
p77
aa(lp78
VNo. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food,
p79
aVis the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.
p80
aVNow, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,
p81
aVbut the evidence is that plants \u2014 and I want to make this clear \u2014
p82
aVit's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.
p83
aVIt's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.
p84
aVThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health.
p85
aVThis evidence is overwhelming at this point.
p86
aVYou eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.
p87
aVNot bad.
p88
aVBut back to animals and junk food.
p89
aVWhat do they have in common?
p90
aVOne: we don't need either of them for health.
p91
aVWe don't need animal products,
p92
aVand we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.
p93
aVTwo: both have been marketed heavily,
p94
aVcreating unnatural demand.
p95
aVWe're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.
p96
aVThree: their production has been supported by government agencies
p97
aVat the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, let's imagine a parallel.
p100
aVLet's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy,
p101
aVwhile discouraging more sustainable forms of energy,
p102
aVknowing all the while that the result would be
p103
aVpollution, war and rising costs.
p104
aVIncredible, isn't it?
p105
aVYet they do that.
p106
aVAnd they do this here. It's the same deal.
p107
aVThe sad thing is, when it comes to diet,
p108
aVis that even when well-intentioned Feds
p109
aVtry to do right by us, they fail.
p110
aVEither they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness,
p111
aVor they are puppets of agribusiness.
p112
aVSo, when the USDA finally acknowledged
p113
aVthat it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,
p114
aVthey encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,
p115
aVto eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,
p116
aValong with more carbs.
p117
aVWhat they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,
p118
aVand that plants and whole grains
p119
aVshould be supplanting eating junk food.
p120
aVBut industry lobbyists would never let that happen.
p121
aVAnd guess what?
p122
aVHalf the people who developed the food pyramid
p123
aVhave ties to agribusiness.
p124
aVSo, instead of substituting plants for animals,
p125
aVour swollen appetites simply became larger,
p126
aVand the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.
p127
aVSo-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets \u2014
p128
aVthese are not solutions.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut with lots of intelligent people
p131
aVfocusing on whether food is organic or local,
p132
aVor whether we're being nice to animals,
p133
aVthe most important issues just aren't being addressed.
p134
aVNow, don't get me wrong.
p135
aVI like animals,
p136
aVand I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production
p137
aVand to churn them out like they were wrenches.
p138
aVBut there's no way to treat animals well,
p139
aVwhen you're killing 10 billion of them a year.
p140
aVThat's our number. 10 billion.
p141
aVIf you strung all of them \u2014
p142
aVchickens, cows, pigs and lambs \u2014 to the moon,
p143
aVthey'd go there and back five times, there and back.
p144
aVNow, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good,
p145
aVand it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long,
p146
aVbut you get the idea.
p147
aVThat's just the United States.
p148
aVAnd with our hyper-consumption of those animals
p149
aVproducing greenhouse gases and heart disease,
p150
aVkindness might just be a bit of a red herring.
p151
aVLet's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down,
p152
aVand then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnother red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore,"
p155
aVwhich was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.
p156
aVSeriously.
p157
aVAnd locavore, for those of you who don't know,
p158
aVis someone who eats only locally grown food \u2014
p159
aVwhich is fine if you live in California,
p160
aVbut for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.
p161
aVBetween the official story \u2014 the food pyramid \u2014
p162
aVand the hip locavore vision,
p163
aVyou have two versions of how to improve our eating.
p164
aV(Laughter).
p165
aa(lp166
VThey both get it wrong, though.
p167
aVThe first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.
p168
aVHow we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.
p169
aVAnd I'm going to go through that,
p170
aVat least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.
p171
aVA hundred years ago, guess what?
p172
aVEveryone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,
p173
aVand shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.
p174
aVEvery family had a cook, usually a mom.
p175
aVAnd those moms bought and prepared food.
p176
aVIt was like your romantic vision of Europe.
p177
aVMargarine didn't exist.
p178
aVIn fact, when margarine was invented,
p179
aVseveral states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,
p180
aVso we'd all know that it was a fake.
p181
aVThere was no snack food, and until the '20s,
p182
aVuntil Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.
p183
aVThere were no restaurant chains.
p184
aVThere were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,
p185
aVbut none of them would think to open another one.
p186
aVEating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.
p187
aVAnd fancy food was entirely French.
p188
aVAs an aside, those of you who remember
p189
aVDan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations
p190
aVcan see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VBack in those days, before even Julia,
p194
aVback in those days, there was no philosophy of food.
p195
aVYou just ate.
p196
aVYou didn't claim to be anything.
p197
aVThere was no marketing. There were no national brands.
p198
aVVitamins had not been invented.
p199
aVThere were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.
p200
aVFats, carbs, proteins \u2014 they weren't bad or good, they were food.
p201
aVYou ate food.
p202
aVHardly anything contained more than one ingredient,
p203
aVbecause it was an ingredient.
p204
aVThe cornflake hadn't been invented.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVThe Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.
p207
aVGoldfish swam.
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aVIt's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.
p210
aVAnd again, everyone ate local.
p211
aVIn New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,
p212
aVbecause it came all the way from Florida.
p213
aVFrom the '30s on, road systems expanded,
p214
aVtrucks took the place of railroads,
p215
aVfresh food began to travel more.
p216
aVOranges became common in New York.
p217
aVThe South and West became agricultural hubs,
p218
aVand in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.
p219
aVThe effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.
p220
aVAnd the death of family farms is part of this puzzle,
p221
aVas is almost everything
p222
aVfrom the demise of the real community
p223
aVto the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.
p224
aVEventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh,
p225
aVso it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.
p226
aVThus arrived convenience.
p227
aVIt was sold to proto-feminist housewives
p228
aVas a way to cut down on housework.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 \u2014
p231
aVtheir mouths are watering at this point.
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aV(Applause)
p234
aVIf we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVBut this may have cut down on housework,
p237
aVbut it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.
p238
aVMany of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable
p239
aVexcept the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.
p240
aVI, for one \u2014 and I'm not kidding \u2014
p241
aVdidn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.
p242
aVWho needed it though? Meat was everywhere.
p243
aVWhat could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family
p244
aVthan broiling a steak?
p245
aVBut by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.
p246
aVRather than spending their lives eating grass,
p247
aVfor which their stomachs were designed,
p248
aVthey were forced to eat soy and corn.
p249
aVThey have trouble digesting those grains, of course,
p250
aVbut that wasn't a problem for producers.
p251
aVNew drugs kept them healthy.
p252
aVWell, they kept them alive.
p253
aVHealthy was another story.
p254
aa(lp255
VThanks to farm subsidies,
p256
aVthe fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress,
p257
aVsoy, corn and cattle became king.
p258
aVAnd chicken soon joined them on the throne.
p259
aVIt was during this period that the cycle of
p260
aVdietary and planetary destruction began,
p261
aVthe thing we're only realizing just now.
p262
aVListen to this,
p263
aVbetween 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.
p264
aVMeat consumption increased five-fold.
p265
aVNow, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.
p266
aVAnd this took care of the situation resoundingly.
p267
aVHome cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.
p268
aVThere were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups,
p269
aVbecause all of them could be bought at any store.
p270
aVNot that they were any good, but they were there.
p271
aVMost moms cooked like mine:
p272
aVa piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing,
p273
aVcanned soup, canned fruit salad.
p274
aVMaybe baked or mashed potatoes,
p275
aVor perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.
p276
aVFor dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.
p277
aVMy mom is not here, so I can say this now.
p278
aVThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VIt wasn't all bad.
p282
aVBy the '70s, forward-thinking people
p283
aVbegan to recognize the value of local ingredients.
p284
aVWe tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,
p285
aVwe knew or we were vegetarians.
p286
aVWe weren't all hippies, either.
p287
aVSome of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.
p288
aVMeanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.
p289
aVPerhaps because it was being produced rationally,
p290
aVas if it were plastic,
p291
aVfood gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.
p292
aVMany people became fat-phobic.
p293
aVOthers worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.
p294
aVBut mostly they didn't eat broccoli.
p295
aVInstead they were sold on yogurt,
p296
aVyogurt being almost as good as broccoli.
p297
aVExcept, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt
p298
aVwas to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.
p299
aVSimilarly, let's look at a granola bar.
p300
aVYou think that that might be healthy food,
p301
aVbut in fact, if you look at the ingredient list,
p302
aVit's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.
p303
aVSadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma,
p304
aVif not actually killed \u2014
p305
aVthe beginning of the heyday of value-added food,
p306
aVwhich contained as many soy and corn products
p307
aVas could be crammed into it.
p308
aa(lp309
VThink of the frozen chicken nugget.
p310
aVThe chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up,
p311
aVand mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder,
p312
aVand then it's fried in corn oil.
p313
aVAll you do is nuke it. What could be better?
p314
aVAnd zapped horribly, pathetically.
p315
aVBy the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state
p316
aVthat the high fat and spice contents of foods
p317
aVlike McNuggets and Hot Pockets \u2014
p318
aVand we all have our favorites, actually \u2014
p319
aVmade this stuff more appealing than the bland things
p320
aVthat people were serving at home.
p321
aVAt the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce,
p322
aVand cooking simply wasn't important enough
p323
aVfor men to share the burden.
p324
aVSo now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights,
p325
aVyou've got your grazing nights,
p326
aVyou've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.
p327
aa(lp328
VLeading the way \u2014 what's leading the way?
p329
aVMeat, junk food, cheese:
p330
aVthe very stuff that will kill you.
p331
aVSo, now we clamor for organic food.
p332
aVThat's good.
p333
aVAnd as evidence that things can actually change,
p334
aVyou can now find organic food in supermarkets,
p335
aVand even in fast-food outlets.
p336
aVBut organic food isn't the answer either,
p337
aVat least not the way it's currently defined.
p338
aVLet me pose you a question.
p339
aVCan farm-raised salmon be organic,
p340
aVwhen its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet,
p341
aVeven if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves
p342
aVare packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?
p343
aVAnd if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there
p344
aVand then flown 5,000 miles, whatever,
p345
aVdumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?
p346
aVI don't know.
p347
aVPacked in Styrofoam, of course,
p348
aVbefore landing somewhere in the United States,
p349
aVand then being trucked a few hundred more miles.
p350
aVThis may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.
p351
aVNow here is where we all meet.
p352
aVThe locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians,
p353
aVthe vegans, the gourmets
p354
aVand those of us who are just plain interested in good food.
p355
aVEven though we've come to this from different points,
p356
aVwe all have to act on our knowledge
p357
aVto change the way that everyone thinks about food.
p358
aa(lp359
VWe need to start acting.
p360
aVAnd this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said \u2014
p361
aVand, of course, she's completely right \u2014
p362
aVbut it's also one of global survival.
p363
aVWhich bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue,
p364
aVthe overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.
p365
aVAs I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases
p366
aVare attributed to livestock production.
p367
aVHow much livestock do you need to produce this?
p368
aV70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth,
p369
aV30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted
p370
aVto raising the animals we'll eat.
p371
aVAnd this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd if the numbers coming in from China
p374
aVare anything like what they look like now,
p375
aVit's not going to be 40 years.
p376
aVThere is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.
p377
aVAnd I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.
p378
aVThe most common argument is that we need nutrients \u2014
p379
aVeven though we eat, on average, twice as much protein
p380
aVas even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.
p381
aVBut listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction
p382
aVrecommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.
p383
aa(lp384
VWhat do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.
p385
aVBut don't we need meat to be big and strong?
p386
aVIsn't meat eating essential to health?
p387
aVWon't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables
p388
aVturn us into godless, sissy, liberals?
p389
aV(Laughter)
p390
aVSome of us might think that would be a good thing.
p391
aVBut, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players,
p392
aVthe answer is no.
p393
aVIn fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets
p394
aVbasic nutritional needs that won't promote growth,
p395
aVand many will make you much healthier than ours does.
p396
aVWe don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition,
p397
aVwe eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.
p398
aVTo suggest that in the interests of personal and human health
p399
aVAmericans eat 50 percent less meat \u2014
p400
aVit's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.
p401
aa(lp402
VIt would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen,
p403
aVand what progressive people, forward-thinking people
p404
aVshould be doing and advocating,
p405
aValong with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.
p406
aVI've been writing about food more or less omnivorously \u2014
p407
aVone might say indiscriminately \u2014 for about 30 years.
p408
aVDuring that time, I've eaten
p409
aVand recommended eating just about everything.
p410
aVI'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure,
p411
aVbut I do think that for the benefit of everyone,
p412
aVthe time has come to stop raising them industrially
p413
aVand stop eating them thoughtlessly.
p414
aa(lp415
VAnn Cooper's right.
p416
aVThe USDA is not our ally here.
p417
aVWe have to take matters into our own hands,
p418
aVnot only by advocating for a better diet for everyone \u2014
p419
aVand that's the hard part \u2014 but by improving our own.
p420
aVAnd that happens to be quite easy.
p421

VI'm here to tell you about the real search for alien life.
p5
aVNot little green humanoids arriving in shiny UFOs,
p6
aValthough that would be nice.
p7
aVBut it's the search for planets orbiting stars far away.
p8
aa(lp9
VEvery star in our sky is a sun.
p10
aVAnd if our sun has planets \u2014
p11
aVMercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.,
p12
aVsurely those other stars should have planets also,
p13
aVand they do.
p14
aVAnd in the last two decades,
p15
aVastronomers have found thousands of exoplanets.
p16
aa(lp17
VOur night sky is literally teeming with exoplanets.
p18
aVWe know, statistically speaking,
p19
aVthat every star has at least one planet.
p20
aVAnd in the search for planets,
p21
aVand in the future, planets that might be like Earth,
p22
aVwe're able to help address
p23
aVsome of the most amazing and mysterious questions
p24
aVthat have faced humankind for centuries.
p25
aVWhy are we here?
p26
aVWhy does our universe exist?
p27
aVHow did Earth form and evolve?
p28
aVHow and why did life originate and populate our planet?
p29
aVThe second question that we often think about is:
p30
aVAre we alone?
p31
aVIs there life out there?
p32
aVWho is out there?
p33
aVYou know, this question has been around for thousands of years,
p34
aVsince at least the time of the Greek philosophers.
p35
aVBut I'm here to tell you just how close we're getting
p36
aVto finding out the answer to this question.
p37
aVIt's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow when I think about the possibilities for life out there,
p40
aVI think of the fact that our sun is but one of many stars.
p41
aVThis is a photograph of a real galaxy,
p42
aVwe think our Milky Way looks like this galaxy.
p43
aVIt's a collection of bound stars.
p44
aVBut our [sun] is one of hundreds of billions of stars
p45
aVand our galaxy is one of upwards of hundreds of billions of galaxies.
p46
aVKnowing that small planets are very common,
p47
aVyou can just do the math.
p48
aVAnd there are just so many stars and so many planets out there,
p49
aVthat surely, there must be life somewhere out there.
p50
aVWell, the biologists get furious with me for saying that,
p51
aVbecause we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet.
p52
aa(lp53
VWell, if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside
p54
aVand zoom in to where our sun is,
p55
aVwe see a real map of the stars.
p56
aVAnd the highlighted stars are those with known exoplanets.
p57
aVThis is really just the tip of the iceberg.
p58
aVHere, this animation is zooming in onto our solar system.
p59
aVAnd you'll see here the planets
p60
aVas well as some spacecraft that are also orbiting our sun.
p61
aVNow if we can imagine going to the West Coast of North America,
p62
aVand looking out at the night sky,
p63
aVhere's what we'd see on a spring night.
p64
aVAnd you can see the constellations overlaid
p65
aVand again, so many stars with planets.
p66
aVThere's a special patch of the sky where we have thousands of planets.
p67
aa(lp68
VThis is where the Kepler Space Telescope focused for many years.
p69
aVLet's zoom in and look at one of the favorite exoplanets.
p70
aVThis star is called Kepler-186f.
p71
aVIt's a system of about five planets.
p72
aVAnd by the way, most of these exoplanets, we don't know too much about.
p73
aVWe know their size, and their orbit and things like that.
p74
aVBut there's a very special planet here called Kepler-186f.
p75
aVThis planet is in a zone that is not too far from the star,
p76
aVso that the temperature may be just right for life.
p77
aVHere, the artist's conception is just zooming in
p78
aVand showing you what that planet might be like.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo, many people have this romantic notion of astronomers
p81
aVgoing to the telescope on a lonely mountaintop
p82
aVand looking at the spectacular night sky through a big telescope.
p83
aVBut actually, we just work on our computers like everyone else,
p84
aVand we get our data by email or downloading from a database.
p85
aVSo instead of coming here to tell you
p86
aVabout the somewhat tedious nature of the data and data analysis
p87
aVand the complex computer models we make,
p88
aVI have a different way to try to explain to you
p89
aVsome of the things that we're thinking about exoplanets.
p90
aa(lp91
VHere's a travel poster:
p92
aV"Kepler-186f:
p93
aVWhere the grass is always redder on the other side."
p94
aVThat's because Kepler-186f orbits a red star,
p95
aVand we're just speculating that perhaps the plants there,
p96
aVif there is vegetation that does photosynthesis,
p97
aVit has different pigments and looks red.
p98
aV"Enjoy the gravity on HD 40307g,
p99
aVa Super-Earth."
p100
aVThis planet is more massive than Earth
p101
aVand has a higher surface gravity.
p102
aV"Relax on Kepler-16b,
p103
aVwhere your shadow always has company."
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVWe know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars,
p106
aVand there's likely many more out there.
p107
aVIf we could visit one of those planets,
p108
aVyou literally would see two sunsets
p109
aVand have two shadows.
p110
aVSo actually, science fiction got some things right.
p111
aVTatooine from Star Wars.
p112
aVAnd I have a couple of other favorite exoplanets
p113
aVto tell you about.
p114
aVThis one is Kepler-10b,
p115
aVit's a hot, hot planet.
p116
aVIt orbits over 50 times closer to its star
p117
aVthan our Earth does to our sun.
p118
aVAnd actually, it's so hot,
p119
aVwe can't visit any of these planets, but if we could,
p120
aVwe would melt long before we got there.
p121
aVWe think the surface is hot enough to melt rock
p122
aVand has liquid lava lakes.
p123
aa(lp124
VGliese 1214b.
p125
aVThis planet, we know the mass and the size
p126
aVand it has a fairly low density.
p127
aVIt's somewhat warm.
p128
aVWe actually don't know really anything about this planet,
p129
aVbut one possibility is that it's a water world,
p130
aVlike a scaled-up version of one of Jupiter's icy moons
p131
aVthat might be 50 percent water by mass.
p132
aVAnd in this case, it would have a thick steam atmosphere
p133
aVoverlaying an ocean,
p134
aVnot of liquid water,
p135
aVbut of an exotic form of water, a superfluid \u2014
p136
aVnot quite a gas, not quite a liquid.
p137
aVAnd under that wouldn't be rock,
p138
aVbut a form of high-pressure ice,
p139
aVlike ice IX.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo out of all these planets out there,
p142
aVand the variety is just simply astonishing,
p143
aVwe mostly want to find the planets that are Goldilocks planets, we call them.
p144
aVNot too big, not too small,
p145
aVnot too hot, not too cold \u2014
p146
aVbut just right for life.
p147
aVBut to do that, we'd have to be able to look
p148
aVat the planet's atmosphere,
p149
aVbecause the atmosphere acts like a blanket trapping heat \u2014
p150
aVthe greenhouse effect.
p151
aVWe have to be able to assess the greenhouse gases
p152
aVon other planets.
p153
aVWell, science fiction got some things wrong.
p154
aVThe Star Trek Enterprise
p155
aVhad to travel vast distances at incredible speeds
p156
aVto orbit other planets
p157
aVso that First Officer Spock could analyze the atmosphere
p158
aVto see if the planet was habitable
p159
aVor if there were lifeforms there.
p160
aa(lp161
VWell, we don't need to travel at warp speeds
p162
aVto see other planet atmospheres,
p163
aValthough I don't want to dissuade any budding engineers
p164
aVfrom figuring out how to do that.
p165
aVWe actually can and do study planet atmospheres
p166
aVfrom here, from Earth orbit.
p167
aVThis is a picture, a photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope
p168
aVtaken by the shuttle Atlantis as it was departing
p169
aVafter the last human space flight to Hubble.
p170
aVThey installed a new camera, actually,
p171
aVthat we use for exoplanet atmospheres.
p172
aVAnd so far, we've been able to study dozens of exoplanet atmospheres,
p173
aVabout six of them in great detail.
p174
aVBut those are not small planets like Earth.
p175
aVThey're big, hot planets that are easy to see.
p176
aVWe're not ready,
p177
aVwe don't have the right technology yet to study small exoplanets.
p178
aVBut nevertheless,
p179
aVI wanted to try to explain to you how we study exoplanet atmospheres.
p180
aa(lp181
VI want you to imagine, for a moment, a rainbow.
p182
aVAnd if we could look at this rainbow closely,
p183
aVwe would see that some dark lines are missing.
p184
aVAnd here's our sun,
p185
aVthe white light of our sun split up,
p186
aVnot by raindrops, but by a spectrograph.
p187
aVAnd you can see all these dark, vertical lines.
p188
aVSome are very narrow, some are wide,
p189
aVsome are shaded at the edges.
p190
aVAnd this is actually how astronomers have studied objects in the heavens,
p191
aVliterally, for over a century.
p192
aVSo here, each different atom and molecule
p193
aVhas a special set of lines,
p194
aVa fingerprint, if you will.
p195
aVAnd that's how we study exoplanet atmospheres.
p196
aVAnd I'll just never forget when I started working
p197
aVon exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago,
p198
aVhow many people told me,
p199
aV"This will never happen.
p200
aVWe'll never be able to study them. Why are you bothering?"
p201
aVAnd that's why I'm pleased to tell you about all the atmospheres studied now,
p202
aVand this is really a field of its own.
p203
aVSo when it comes to other planets, other Earths,
p204
aVin the future when we can observe them,
p205
aVwhat kind of gases would we be looking for?
p206
aVWell, you know, our own Earth has oxygen in the atmosphere
p207
aVto 20 percent by volume.
p208
aVThat's a lot of oxygen.
p209
aVBut without plants and photosynthetic life,
p210
aVthere would be no oxygen,
p211
aVvirtually no oxygen in our atmosphere.
p212
aVSo oxygen is here because of life.
p213
aVAnd our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres,
p214
aVgases that don't belong,
p215
aVthat we might be able to attribute to life.
p216
aVBut which molecules should we search for?
p217
aVI actually told you how diverse exoplanets are.
p218
aVWe expect that to continue in the future
p219
aVwhen we find other Earths.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd that's one of the main things I'm working on now,
p222
aVI have a theory about this.
p223
aVIt reminds me that nearly every day,
p224
aVI receive an email or emails
p225
aVfrom someone with a crazy theory about physics of gravity
p226
aVor cosmology or some such.
p227
aVSo, please don't email me one of your crazy theories.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVWell, I had my own crazy theory.
p230
aVBut, who does the MIT professor go to?
p231
aVWell, I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine
p232
aVand he said, "Sure, come and talk to me."
p233
aVSo I brought my two biochemistry friends
p234
aVand we went to talk to him about our crazy theory.
p235
aVAnd that theory was that life produces all small molecules,
p236
aVso many molecules.
p237
aVLike, everything I could think of, but not being a chemist.
p238
aVThink about it:
p239
aVcarbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
p240
aVmolecular hydrogen, molecular nitrogen,
p241
aVmethane, methyl chloride \u2014
p242
aVso many gases.
p243
aVThey also exist for other reasons,
p244
aVbut just life even produces ozone.
p245
aVSo we go to talk to him about this,
p246
aVand immediately, he shot down the theory.
p247
aVHe found an example that didn't exist.
p248
aVSo, we went back to the drawing board
p249
aVand we think we have found something very interesting in another field.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut back to exoplanets,
p252
aVthe point is that life produces so many different types of gases,
p253
aVliterally thousands of gases.
p254
aVAnd so what we're doing now is just trying to figure out
p255
aVon which types of exoplanets,
p256
aVwhich gases could be attributed to life.
p257
aVAnd so when it comes time when we find gases
p258
aVin exoplanet atmospheres
p259
aVthat we won't know if they're being produced
p260
aVby intelligent aliens or by trees,
p261
aVor a swamp,
p262
aVor even just by simple, single-celled microbial life.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo working on the models
p265
aVand thinking about biochemistry,
p266
aVit's all well and good.
p267
aVBut a really big challenge ahead of us is: how?
p268
aVHow are we going to find these planets?
p269
aVThere are actually many ways to find planets,
p270
aVseveral different ways.
p271
aVBut the one that I'm most focused on is how can we open a gateway
p272
aVso that in the future,
p273
aVwe can find hundreds of Earths.
p274
aVWe have a real shot at finding signs of life.
p275
aVAnd actually, I just finished leading a two-year project
p276
aVin this very special phase
p277
aVof a concept we call the starshade.
p278
aVAnd the starshade is a very specially shaped screen
p279
aVand the goal is to fly that starshade
p280
aVso it blocks out the light of a star
p281
aVso that the telescope can see the planets directly.
p282
aVHere, you can see myself and two team members
p283
aVholding up one small part of the starshade.
p284
aVIt's shaped like a giant flower,
p285
aVand this is one of the prototype petals.
p286
aVThe concept is that a starshade and telescope could launch together,
p287
aVwith the petals unfurling from the stowed position.
p288
aVThe central truss would expand,
p289
aVwith the petals snapping into place.
p290
aVNow, this has to be made very precisely,
p291
aVliterally, the petals to microns
p292
aVand they have to deploy to millimeters.
p293
aVAnd this whole structure would have to fly
p294
aVtens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope.
p295
aVIt's about tens of meters in diameter.
p296
aVAnd the goal is to block out the starlight to incredible precision
p297
aVso that we'd be able to see the planets directly.
p298
aVAnd it has to be a very special shape,
p299
aVbecause of the physics of defraction.
p300
aVNow this is a real project that we worked on,
p301
aVliterally, you would not believe how hard.
p302
aVJust so you believe it's not just in movie format,
p303
aVhere's a real photograph
p304
aVof a second-generation starshade deployment test bed in the lab.
p305
aVAnd in this case, I just wanted you to know
p306
aVthat that central truss has heritage left over
p307
aVfrom large radio deployables in space.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo after all of that hard work
p310
aVwhere we try to think of all the crazy gases that might be out there,
p311
aVand we build the very complicated space telescopes
p312
aVthat might be out there,
p313
aVwhat are we going to find?
p314
aVWell, in the best case,
p315
aVwe will find an image of another exo-Earth.
p316
aVHere is Earth as a pale blue dot.
p317
aVAnd this is actually a real photograph of Earth
p318
aVtaken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft,
p319
aVfour billion miles away.
p320
aVAnd that red light is just scattered light in the camera optics.
p321
aa(lp322
VBut what's so awesome to consider
p323
aVis that if there are intelligent aliens
p324
aVorbiting on a planet around a star near to us
p325
aVand they build complicated space telescopes
p326
aVof the kind that we're trying to build,
p327
aVall they'll see is this pale blue dot,
p328
aVa pinprick of light.
p329
aVAnd so sometimes, when I pause to think
p330
aVabout my professional struggle and huge ambition,
p331
aVit's hard to think about that
p332
aVin contrast to the vastness of the universe.
p333
aVBut nonetheless, I am devoting the rest of my life
p334
aVto finding another Earth.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd I can guarantee
p337
aa(lp338
Vthat in the next generation of space telescopes,
p339
aVin the second generation,
p340
aVwe will have the capability to find and identity other Earths.
p341
aVAnd the capability to split up the starlight
p342
aVso that we can look for gases
p343
aVand assess the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
p344
aVestimate the surface temperature,
p345
aVand look for signs of life.
p346
aa(lp347
VBut there's more.
p348
aVIn this case of searching for other planets like Earth,
p349
aVwe are making a new kind of map
p350
aVof the nearby stars and of the planets orbiting them,
p351
aVincluding [planets] that actually might be inhabitable by humans.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd so I envision that our descendants,
p354
aVhundreds of years from now,
p355
aVwill embark on an interstellar journey to other worlds.
p356
aVAnd they will look back at all of us
p357
aVas the generation who first found the Earth-like worlds.
p358
aa(lp359
VThank you.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Applause)
p362
aa(lp363
VJune Cohen: And I give you, for a question,
p364
aVRosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen.
p365
aa(lp366
VFred Jansen: You mentioned halfway through
p367
aVthat the technology to actually look at the spectrum
p368
aVof an exoplanet like Earth is not there yet.
p369
aVWhen do you expect this will be there,
p370
aVand what's needed?
p371
aa(lp372
VActually, what we expect is what we call our next-generation Hubble telescope.
p373
aVAnd this is called the James Webb Space Telescope,
p374
aVand that will launch in 2018,
p375
aVand that's what we're going to do,
p376
aVwe're going to look at a special kind of planet
p377
aVcalled transient exoplanets,
p378
aVand that will be our first shot at studying small planets
p379
aVfor gases that might indicate the planet is habitable.
p380
aa(lp381
VJC: I'm going to ask you one follow-up question, too, Sara,
p382
aVas the generalist.
p383
aVSo I am really struck by the notion in your career
p384
aVof the opposition you faced,
p385
aVthat when you began thinking about exoplanets,
p386
aVthere was extreme skepticism in the scientific community
p387
aVthat they existed,
p388
aVand you proved them wrong.
p389
aVWhat did it take to take that on?
p390
aa(lp391
VSS: Well, the thing is that as scientists,
p392
aVwe're supposed to be skeptical,
p393
aVbecause our job to make sure that what the other person is saying
p394
aVactually makes sense or not.
p395
aVBut being a scientist,
p396
aVI think you've seen it from this session,
p397
aVit's like being an explorer.
p398
aVYou have this immense curiosity,
p399
aVthis stubbornness,
p400
aVthis sort of resolute will that you will go forward
p401
aVno matter what other people say.
p402
aa(lp403
VJC: I love that. Thank you, Sara.

VReligion is more than belief.
p5
aVIt's power, and it's influence.
p6
aVAnd that influence affects all of us,
p7
aVevery day, regardless of your own belief.
p8
aVDespite the enormous influence of religion on the world today,
p9
aVwe hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability
p10
aVthan any other sector of our society.
p11
aVFor example, if there were a multinational organization,
p12
aVgovernment or corporation today
p13
aVthat said no female could be on a leadership board,
p14
aVnot one woman could have a decision-making authority,
p15
aVnot one woman could handle any financial matter,
p16
aVwe would have outrage.
p17
aVThere would be sanctions.
p18
aVAnd yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today.
p19
aa(lp20
VWe accept things in our religious lives
p21
aVthat we do not accept in our secular lives,
p22
aVand I know this because I've been doing it for three decades.
p23
aVI was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up.
p24
aVI played pickup basketball games with the boys and inserted myself.
p25
aVI said I was going to be the first female President of the United States.
p26
aVI have been fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment,
p27
aVwhich has been dead for 40 years.
p28
aVI'm the first woman in both sides of my family
p29
aVto ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education.
p30
aa(lp31
VI never accepted being excluded because I was a woman,
p32
aVexcept in my religion.
p33
aVThroughout all of that time,
p34
aVI was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox Mormon religion.
p35
aVI grew up in an enormously traditional family.
p36
aVI have eight siblings, a stay-at-home mother.
p37
aVMy father's actually a religious leader in the community.
p38
aVAnd I grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing
p39
aVwas in keeping these rules that I'd known my whole life.
p40
aVYou get married a virgin, you never drink alcohol,
p41
aVyou don't smoke, you always do service,
p42
aVyou're a good kid.
p43
aVSome of the rules we had were strict,
p44
aVbut you followed the rules because you loved the people
p45
aVand you loved the religion and you believed.
p46
aa(lp47
VEverything about Mormonism determined what you wore,
p48
aVwho you dated, who you married.
p49
aVIt determined what underwear we wore.
p50
aVI was the kind of religious where everyone I know
p51
aVdonated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church,
p52
aVincluding myself.
p53
aVFrom paper routes and babysitting, I donated 10 percent.
p54
aVI was the kind of religious where I heard parents tell children
p55
aVwhen they're leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission
p56
aVthat they would rather have them die
p57
aVthan return home without honor, having sinned.
p58
aVI was the type and the kind of religious
p59
aVwhere kids kill themselves every single year
p60
aVbecause they're terrified of coming out to our community as gay.
p61
aVBut I was also the kind of religious
p62
aVwhere it didn't matter where in the world I lived,
p63
aVI had friendship, instantaneous mutual aid.
p64
aVThis was where I felt safe. This is certainty and clarity about life.
p65
aVI had help raising my little daughter.
p66
aVSo that's why I accepted without question that only men can lead,
p67
aVand I accepted without question
p68
aVthat women can't have the spiritual authority of God on the Earth,
p69
aVwhich we call the priesthood.
p70
aVAnd I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets,
p71
aVdisciplinary councils, in decision-making capacities,
p72
aVand I gave my religion a free pass
p73
aVbecause I loved it.
p74
aa(lp75
VUntil I stopped,
p76
aVand I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated
p77
aVas the support staff to the real work of men.
p78
aVAnd I faced this contradiction in myself,
p79
aVand I joined with other activists in my community.
p80
aVWe've been working very, very, very hard for the last decade and more.
p81
aa(lp82
VThe first thing we did was raise consciousness.
p83
aVYou can't change what you can't see.
p84
aVWe started podcasting, blogging, writing articles.
p85
aVI created lists of hundreds of ways
p86
aVthat men and women are unequal in our community.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe next thing we did was build advocacy organizations.
p89
aVWe tried to do things that were unignorable,
p90
aVlike wearing pants to church and trying to attend all-male meetings.
p91
aVThese seem like simple things,
p92
aVbut to us, the organizers, they were enormously costly.
p93
aVWe lost relationships. We lost jobs.
p94
aVWe got hate mail on a daily basis.
p95
aVWe were attacked in social media and national press.
p96
aVWe received death threats.
p97
aVWe lost standing in our community. Some of us got excommunicated.
p98
aVMost of us got put in front of a disciplinary council,
p99
aVand were rejected from the communities that we loved
p100
aVbecause we wanted to make them better, because we believed that they could be.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I began to expect this reaction from my own people.
p103
aVI know what it feels like when you feel like someone's trying to change you
p104
aVor criticize you.
p105
aVBut what utterly shocked me was throughout all of this work
p106
aVI received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left,
p107
aVthe same vehemence as the religious right.
p108
aVAnd what my secular friends didn't realize was that this religious hostility,
p109
aVthese phrases of, "Oh, all religious people are crazy or stupid."
p110
aV"Don't pay attention to religion."
p111
aV"They're going to be homophobic and sexist."
p112
aVWhat they didn't understand
p113
aVwas that that type of hostility did not fight religious extremism,
p114
aVit bred religious extremism.
p115
aVThose arguments don't work, and I know because I remember
p116
aVsomeone telling me that I was stupid for being Mormon.
p117
aVAnd what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people
p118
aVand everything we believe in, because we're not stupid.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo criticism and hostility doesn't work, and I didn't listen to these arguments.
p121
aVWhen I hear these arguments, I still continue to bristle,
p122
aVbecause I have family and friends.
p123
aVThese are my people, and I'm the first to defend them,
p124
aVbut the struggle is real.
p125
aVHow do we respect someone's religious beliefs
p126
aVwhile still holding them accountable for the harm or damage
p127
aVthat those beliefs may cause others?
p128
aVIt's a tough question. I still don't have a perfect answer.
p129
aVMy parents and I have been walking on this tightrope for the last decade.
p130
aVThey're intelligent people. They're lovely people.
p131
aVAnd let me try to help you understand their perspective.
p132
aVIn Mormonism, we believe that after you die,
p133
aVif you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals,
p134
aVyou can be together as a family again.
p135
aVAnd to my parents, me doing something as simple
p136
aVas having a sleeveless top right now, showing my shoulders,
p137
aVthat makes me unworthy.
p138
aVI won't be with my family in the eternities.
p139
aVBut even more, I had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15,
p140
aVand something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family.
p141
aVAnd to my parents, they cannot understand
p142
aVwhy something as simple as fashion or women's rights
p143
aVwould prevent me from seeing my brother again.
p144
aVAnd that's the mindset that we're dealing with,
p145
aVand criticism does not change that.
p146
aVAnd so my parents and I have been walking this tightrope,
p147
aVexplaining our sides, respecting one another,
p148
aVbut actually invalidating each other's very basic beliefs
p149
aVby the way we live our lives, and it's been difficult.
p150
aVThe way that we've been able to do that
p151
aVis to get past those defensive shells
p152
aVand really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief
p153
aVand try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear.
p154
aa(lp155
VThe other thing that the secular left and the atheists and the orthodox
p156
aVand the religious right, what they all don't understand
p157
aVwas why even care about religious activism?
p158
aVI cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said,
p159
aV"If you don't like religion, just leave."
p160
aVWhy would you try to change it?
p161
aVBecause what is taught on the Sabbath
p162
aVleaks into our politics, our health policy,
p163
aVviolence around the world.
p164
aVIt leaks into education, military, fiscal decision-making.
p165
aVThese laws get legally and culturally codified.
p166
aVIn fact, my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation.
p167
aVFor example, during Prop 8, my church raised over 22 million dollars
p168
aVto fight same-sex marriage in California.
p169
aVForty years ago, political historians will say,
p170
aVthat if it wasn't for the Mormon opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment,
p171
aVwe'd have an Equal Rights Amendment in our Constitution today.
p172
aVHow many lives did that affect?
p173
aVAnd we can spend time fighting every single one
p174
aVof these little tiny laws and rules,
p175
aVor we can ask ourselves,
p176
aVwhy is gender inequality the default around the world?
p177
aVWhy is that the assumption?
p178
aa(lp179
VBecause religion doesn't just create the roots of morality,
p180
aVit creates the seeds of normality.
p181
aVReligions can liberate or subjugate,
p182
aVthey can empower or exploit, they can comfort or destroy,
p183
aVand the people that tip the scales over to the ethical and the moral
p184
aVare often not those in charge.
p185
aVReligions can't be dismissed or ignored.
p186
aVWe need to take them seriously.
p187
aVBut it's not easy to influence a religion, like we just talked about.
p188
aa(lp189
VBut I'll tell you what my people have done.
p190
aVMy groups are small, there's hundreds of us,
p191
aVbut we've had huge impact.
p192
aVRight now, women's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men
p193
aVfor the first time.
p194
aVWomen are now allowed to pray in our church-wide meetings,
p195
aVand they never were before in the general conferences.
p196
aVAs of last week, in a historic move,
p197
aVthree women were invited down to three leadership boards
p198
aVthat oversee the entire church.
p199
aVWe've seen perceptual shifts in the Mormon community
p200
aVthat allow for talk of gender inequality.
p201
aVWe've opened up space, regardless of being despised,
p202
aVfor more conservative women to step in and make real changes,
p203
aVand the words "women" and "the priesthood" can now be uttered in the same sentence.
p204
aVI never had that.
p205
aVMy daughter and my nieces are inheriting a religion that I never had,
p206
aVthat's more equal \u2014 we've had an effect.
p207
aa(lp208
VIt wasn't easy standing in those lines
p209
aVtrying to get into those male meetings.
p210
aVThere were hundreds of us,
p211
aVand one by one, when we got to the door,
p212
aVwe were told, "I'm sorry, this meeting is just for men,"
p213
aVand we had to step back and watch men get into the meeting
p214
aVas young as 12 years old,
p215
aVescorted and walked past us as we all stood in line.
p216
aVBut not one woman in that line will forget that day,
p217
aVand not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day.
p218
aa(lp219
VIf we were a multinational corporation or a government, and that had happened,
p220
aVthere would be outrage,
p221
aVbut we're just a religion.
p222
aVWe're all just part of religions.
p223
aVWe can't keep looking at religion that way,
p224
aVbecause it doesn't only affect me, it affects my daughter
p225
aVand all of your daughters and what opportunities they have,
p226
aVwhat they can wear, who they can love and marry,
p227
aVif they have access to reproductive healthcare.
p228
aVWe need to reclaim morality in a secular context
p229
aVthat creates ethical scrutiny and accountability
p230
aVfor religions all around the world,
p231
aVbut we need to do it in a respectful way
p232
aVthat breeds cooperation and not extremism.
p233
aVAnd we can do it through unignorable acts of bravery,
p234
aVstanding up for gender equality.
p235
aa(lp236
VIt's time that half of the world's population
p237
aVhad voice and equality within our world's religions,
p238
aVchurches, synagogues, mosques and shrines around the world.
p239
aVI'm working on my people. What are you doing for yours?

VThere is an entire genre of YouTube videos
p5
aVdevoted to an experience which
p6
aVI am certain that everyone in this room has had.
p7
aVIt entails an individual who,
p8
aVthinking they're alone,
p9
aVengages in some expressive behavior \u2014
p10
aVwild singing, gyrating dancing,
p11
aVsome mild sexual activity \u2014
p12
aVonly to discover that, in fact, they are not alone,
p13
aVthat there is a person watching and lurking,
p14
aVthe discovery of which causes them
p15
aVto immediately cease what they were doing
p16
aVin horror.
p17
aVThe sense of shame and humiliation
p18
aVin their face is palpable.
p19
aVIt's the sense of,
p20
aV"This is something I'm willing to do
p21
aVonly if no one else is watching."
p22
aa(lp23
VThis is the crux of the work
p24
aVon which I have been singularly focused
p25
aVfor the last 16 months,
p26
aVthe question of why privacy matters,
p27
aVa question that has arisen
p28
aVin the context of a global debate,
p29
aVenabled by the revelations of Edward Snowden
p30
aVthat the United States and its partners,
p31
aVunbeknownst to the entire world,
p32
aVhas converted the Internet,
p33
aVonce heralded as an unprecedented tool
p34
aVof liberation and democratization,
p35
aVinto an unprecedented zone
p36
aVof mass, indiscriminate surveillance.
p37
aa(lp38
VThere is a very common sentiment
p39
aVthat arises in this debate,
p40
aVeven among people who are uncomfortable
p41
aVwith mass surveillance, which says
p42
aVthat there is no real harm
p43
aVthat comes from this large-scale invasion
p44
aVbecause only people who are engaged in bad acts
p45
aVhave a reason to want to hide
p46
aVand to care about their privacy.
p47
aVThis worldview is implicitly grounded
p48
aVin the proposition that there are two kinds of people in the world,
p49
aVgood people and bad people.
p50
aVBad people are those who plot terrorist attacks
p51
aVor who engage in violent criminality
p52
aVand therefore have reasons to want to hide what they're doing,
p53
aVhave reasons to care about their privacy.
p54
aVBut by contrast, good people
p55
aVare people who go to work,
p56
aVcome home, raise their children, watch television.
p57
aVThey use the Internet not to plot bombing attacks
p58
aVbut to read the news or exchange recipes
p59
aVor to plan their kids' Little League games,
p60
aVand those people are doing nothing wrong
p61
aVand therefore have nothing to hide
p62
aVand no reason to fear
p63
aVthe government monitoring them.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe people who are actually saying that
p66
aVare engaged in a very extreme act
p67
aVof self-deprecation.
p68
aVWhat they're really saying is,
p69
aV"I have agreed to make myself
p70
aVsuch a harmless and unthreatening
p71
aVand uninteresting person that I actually don't fear
p72
aVhaving the government know what it is that I'm doing."
p73
aVThis mindset has found what I think
p74
aVis its purest expression
p75
aVin a 2009 interview with
p76
aVthe longtime CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, who,
p77
aVwhen asked about all the different ways his company
p78
aVis causing invasions of privacy
p79
aVfor hundreds of millions of people around the world,
p80
aVsaid this: He said,
p81
aV"If you're doing something that you don't want
p82
aVother people to know,
p83
aVmaybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, there's all kinds of things to say about
p86
aVthat mentality,
p87
aVthe first of which is that the people who say that,
p88
aVwho say that privacy isn't really important,
p89
aVthey don't actually believe it,
p90
aVand the way you know that they don't actually believe it
p91
aVis that while they say with their words that privacy doesn't matter,
p92
aVwith their actions, they take all kinds of steps
p93
aVto safeguard their privacy.
p94
aVThey put passwords on their email
p95
aVand their social media accounts,
p96
aVthey put locks on their bedroom
p97
aVand bathroom doors,
p98
aVall steps designed to prevent other people
p99
aVfrom entering what they consider their private realm
p100
aVand knowing what it is that they don't want other people to know.
p101
aVThe very same Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google,
p102
aVordered his employees at Google
p103
aVto cease speaking with the online
p104
aVInternet magazine CNET
p105
aVafter CNET published an article
p106
aVfull of personal, private information
p107
aVabout Eric Schmidt,
p108
aVwhich it obtained exclusively through Google searches
p109
aVand using other Google products. (Laughter)
p110
aVThis same division can be seen
p111
aVwith the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,
p112
aVwho in an infamous interview in 2010
p113
aVpronounced that privacy is no longer
p114
aVa "social norm."
p115
aVLast year, Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife
p116
aVpurchased not only their own house
p117
aVbut also all four adjacent houses in Palo Alto
p118
aVfor a total of 30 million dollars
p119
aVin order to ensure that they enjoyed a zone of privacy
p120
aVthat prevented other people from monitoring
p121
aVwhat they do in their personal lives.
p122
aa(lp123
VOver the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world,
p124
aVevery single time somebody has said to me,
p125
aV"I don't really worry about invasions of privacy
p126
aVbecause I don't have anything to hide."
p127
aVI always say the same thing to them.
p128
aVI get out a pen, I write down my email address.
p129
aVI say, "Here's my email address.
p130
aVWhat I want you to do when you get home
p131
aVis email me the passwords
p132
aVto all of your email accounts,
p133
aVnot just the nice, respectable work one in your name,
p134
aVbut all of them,
p135
aVbecause I want to be able to just troll through
p136
aVwhat it is you're doing online,
p137
aVread what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting.
p138
aVAfter all, if you're not a bad person,
p139
aVif you're doing nothing wrong,
p140
aVyou should have nothing to hide."
p141
aa(lp142
VNot a single person has taken me up on that offer.
p143
aVI check and \u2014 (Applause)
p144
aVI check that email account religiously all the time.
p145
aVIt's a very desolate place.
p146
aVAnd there's a reason for that,
p147
aVwhich is that we as human beings,
p148
aVeven those of us who in words
p149
aVdisclaim the importance of our own privacy,
p150
aVinstinctively understand
p151
aVthe profound importance of it.
p152
aVIt is true that as human beings, we're social animals,
p153
aVwhich means we have a need for other people
p154
aVto know what we're doing and saying and thinking,
p155
aVwhich is why we voluntarily publish information about ourselves online.
p156
aVBut equally essential to what it means
p157
aVto be a free and fulfilled human being
p158
aVis to have a place that we can go
p159
aVand be free of the judgmental eyes of other people.
p160
aVThere's a reason why we seek that out,
p161
aVand our reason is that all of us \u2014
p162
aVnot just terrorists and criminals, all of us \u2014
p163
aVhave things to hide.
p164
aVThere are all sorts of things that we do and think
p165
aVthat we're willing to tell our physician
p166
aVor our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse
p167
aVor our best friend that we would be mortified
p168
aVfor the rest of the world to learn.
p169
aVWe make judgments every single day
p170
aVabout the kinds of things that we say and think and do
p171
aVthat we're willing to have other people know,
p172
aVand the kinds of things that we say and think and do
p173
aVthat we don't want anyone else to know about.
p174
aVPeople can very easily in words claim
p175
aVthat they don't value their privacy,
p176
aVbut their actions negate the authenticity of that belief.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, there's a reason why privacy is so craved
p179
aVuniversally and instinctively.
p180
aVIt isn't just a reflexive movement
p181
aVlike breathing air or drinking water.
p182
aVThe reason is that when we're in a state
p183
aVwhere we can be monitored, where we can be watched,
p184
aVour behavior changes dramatically.
p185
aVThe range of behavioral options that we consider
p186
aVwhen we think we're being watched
p187
aVseverely reduce.
p188
aVThis is just a fact of human nature
p189
aVthat has been recognized in social science
p190
aVand in literature and in religion
p191
aVand in virtually every field of discipline.
p192
aVThere are dozens of psychological studies
p193
aVthat prove that when somebody knows
p194
aVthat they might be watched,
p195
aVthe behavior they engage in
p196
aVis vastly more conformist and compliant.
p197
aVHuman shame is a very powerful motivator,
p198
aVas is the desire to avoid it,
p199
aVand that's the reason why people,
p200
aVwhen they're in a state of being watched, make decisions
p201
aVnot that are the byproduct of their own agency
p202
aVbut that are about the expectations
p203
aVthat others have of them
p204
aVor the mandates of societal orthodoxy.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis realization was exploited most powerfully
p207
aVfor pragmatic ends by the 18th- century philosopher Jeremy Bentham,
p208
aVwho set out to resolve an important problem
p209
aVushered in by the industrial age,
p210
aVwhere, for the first time, institutions had become
p211
aVso large and centralized
p212
aVthat they were no longer able to monitor
p213
aVand therefore control each one of their individual members,
p214
aVand the solution that he devised
p215
aVwas an architectural design
p216
aVoriginally intended to be implemented in prisons
p217
aVthat he called the panopticon,
p218
aVthe primary attribute of which was the construction
p219
aVof an enormous tower in the center of the institution
p220
aVwhere whoever controlled the institution
p221
aVcould at any moment watch any of the inmates,
p222
aValthough they couldn't watch all of them at all times.
p223
aVAnd crucial to this design
p224
aVwas that the inmates could not actually
p225
aVsee into the panopticon, into the tower,
p226
aVand so they never knew
p227
aVif they were being watched or even when.
p228
aVAnd what made him so excited about this discovery
p229
aVwas that that would mean that the prisoners
p230
aVwould have to assume that they were being watched
p231
aVat any given moment,
p232
aVwhich would be the ultimate enforcer
p233
aVfor obedience and compliance.
p234
aVThe 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault
p235
aVrealized that that model could be used
p236
aVnot just for prisons but for every institution
p237
aVthat seeks to control human behavior:
p238
aVschools, hospitals, factories, workplaces.
p239
aVAnd what he said was that this mindset,
p240
aVthis framework discovered by Bentham,
p241
aVwas the key means of societal control
p242
aVfor modern, Western societies,
p243
aVwhich no longer need
p244
aVthe overt weapons of tyranny \u2014
p245
aVpunishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents,
p246
aVor legally compelling loyalty to a particular party \u2014
p247
aVbecause mass surveillance creates
p248
aVa prison in the mind
p249
aVthat is a much more subtle
p250
aVthough much more effective means
p251
aVof fostering compliance with social norms
p252
aVor with social orthodoxy,
p253
aVmuch more effective
p254
aVthan brute force could ever be.
p255
aa(lp256
VThe most iconic work of literature about surveillance
p257
aVand privacy is the George Orwell novel "1984,"
p258
aVwhich we all learn in school, and therefore it's almost become a cliche.
p259
aVIn fact, whenever you bring it up in a debate about surveillance,
p260
aVpeople instantaneously dismiss it
p261
aVas inapplicable, and what they say is,
p262
aV"Oh, well in '1984,' there were monitors in people's homes,
p263
aVthey were being watched at every given moment,
p264
aVand that has nothing to do with the surveillance state that we face."
p265
aVThat is an actual fundamental misapprehension
p266
aVof the warnings that Orwell issued in "1984."
p267
aVThe warning that he was issuing
p268
aVwas about a surveillance state
p269
aVnot that monitored everybody at all times,
p270
aVbut where people were aware that they could
p271
aVbe monitored at any given moment.
p272
aVHere is how Orwell's narrator, Winston Smith,
p273
aVdescribed the surveillance system
p274
aVthat they faced:
p275
aV"There was, of course, no way of knowing
p276
aVwhether you were being watched at any given moment."
p277
aVHe went on to say,
p278
aV"At any rate, they could plug in your wire
p279
aVwhenever they wanted to.
p280
aVYou had to live, did live,
p281
aVfrom habit that became instinct,
p282
aVin the assumption that every sound you made
p283
aVwas overheard and except in darkness
p284
aVevery movement scrutinized."
p285
aa(lp286
VThe Abrahamic religions similarly posit
p287
aVthat there's an invisible, all-knowing authority
p288
aVwho, because of its omniscience,
p289
aValways watches whatever you're doing,
p290
aVwhich means you never have a private moment,
p291
aVthe ultimate enforcer
p292
aVfor obedience to its dictates.
p293
aa(lp294
VWhat all of these seemingly disparate works
p295
aVrecognize, the conclusion that they all reach,
p296
aVis that a society in which people
p297
aVcan be monitored at all times
p298
aVis a society that breeds conformity
p299
aVand obedience and submission,
p300
aVwhich is why every tyrant,
p301
aVthe most overt to the most subtle,
p302
aVcraves that system.
p303
aVConversely, even more importantly,
p304
aVit is a realm of privacy,
p305
aVthe ability to go somewhere where we can think
p306
aVand reason and interact and speak
p307
aVwithout the judgmental eyes of others being cast upon us,
p308
aVin which creativity and exploration
p309
aVand dissent exclusively reside,
p310
aVand that is the reason why,
p311
aVwhen we allow a society to exist
p312
aVin which we're subject to constant monitoring,
p313
aVwe allow the essence of human freedom
p314
aVto be severely crippled.
p315
aa(lp316
VThe last point I want to observe about this mindset,
p317
aVthe idea that only people who  are doing something wrong
p318
aVhave things to hide and therefore reasons to care about privacy,
p319
aVis that it entrenches two very destructive messages,
p320
aVtwo destructive lessons,
p321
aVthe first of which is that
p322
aVthe only people who care about privacy,
p323
aVthe only people who will seek out privacy,
p324
aVare by definition bad people.
p325
aVThis is a conclusion that we should have
p326
aVall kinds of reasons for avoiding,
p327
aVthe most important of which is that when you say,
p328
aV"somebody who is doing bad things,"
p329
aVyou probably mean things like plotting a terrorist attack
p330
aVor engaging in violent criminality,
p331
aVa much narrower conception
p332
aVof what people who wield power mean
p333
aVwhen they say, "doing bad things."
p334
aVFor them, "doing bad things" typically means
p335
aVdoing something that poses meaningful challenges
p336
aVto the exercise of our own power.
p337
aa(lp338
VThe other really destructive
p339
aVand, I think, even more insidious lesson
p340
aVthat comes from accepting this mindset
p341
aVis there's an implicit bargain
p342
aVthat people who accept this mindset have accepted,
p343
aVand that bargain is this:
p344
aVIf you're willing to render yourself
p345
aVsufficiently harmless,
p346
aVsufficiently unthreatening
p347
aVto those who wield political power,
p348
aVthen and only then can you be free
p349
aVof the dangers of surveillance.
p350
aVIt's only those who are dissidents,
p351
aVwho challenge power,
p352
aVwho have something to worry about.
p353
aVThere are all kinds of reasons why we should want to avoid that lesson as well.
p354
aVYou may be a person who, right now,
p355
aVdoesn't want to engage in that behavior,
p356
aVbut at some point in the future you might.
p357
aVEven if you're somebody who decides
p358
aVthat you never want to,
p359
aVthe fact that there are other people
p360
aVwho are willing to and able to resist
p361
aVand be adversarial to those in power \u2014
p362
aVdissidents and journalists
p363
aVand activists and a whole range of others \u2014
p364
aVis something that brings us all collective good
p365
aVthat we should want to preserve.
p366
aVEqually critical is that the measure
p367
aVof how free a society is
p368
aVis not how it treats its good,
p369
aVobedient, compliant citizens,
p370
aVbut how it treats its dissidents
p371
aVand those who resist orthodoxy.
p372
aVBut the most important reason
p373
aVis that a system of mass surveillance
p374
aVsuppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways.
p375
aVIt renders off-limits
p376
aVall kinds of behavioral choices
p377
aVwithout our even knowing that it's happened.
p378
aVThe renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg
p379
aVonce said, "He who does not move
p380
aVdoes not notice his chains."
p381
aVWe can try and render the chains
p382
aVof mass surveillance invisible or undetectable,
p383
aVbut the constraints that it imposes on us
p384
aVdo not become any less potent.
p385
aa(lp386
VThank you very much.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Applause)
p389
aa(lp390
VThank you.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Applause)
p393
aa(lp394
VThank you.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Applause)
p397
aa(lp398
VBruno Giussani: Glenn, thank you.
p399
aVThe case is rather convincing, I have to say,
p400
aVbut I want to bring you back
p401
aVto the last 16 months and to Edward Snowden
p402
aVfor a few questions, if you don't mind.
p403
aVThe first one is personal to you.
p404
aVWe have all read about the arrest of your partner,
p405
aVDavid Miranda in London, and other difficulties,
p406
aVbut I assume that
p407
aVin terms of personal engagement and risk,
p408
aVthat the pressure on you is not that easy
p409
aVto take on the biggest sovereign  organizations in the world.
p410
aVTell us a little bit about that.
p411
aa(lp412
VGlenn Greenwald: You know, I think one of the things that happens
p413
aVis that people's courage in this regard
p414
aVgets contagious,
p415
aVand so although I and the other journalists with whom I was working
p416
aVwere certainly aware of the risk \u2014
p417
aVthe United States continues to be the most powerful country in the world
p418
aVand doesn't appreciate it when you
p419
aVdisclose thousands of their secrets
p420
aVon the Internet at will \u2014
p421
aVseeing somebody who is a 29-year-old
p422
aVordinary person who grew up in
p423
aVa very ordinary environment
p424
aVexercise the degree of principled courage that Edward Snowden risked,
p425
aVknowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life
p426
aVor that his life would unravel,
p427
aVinspired me and inspired other journalists
p428
aVand inspired, I think, people around the world,
p429
aVincluding future whistleblowers,
p430
aVto realize that they can engage in that kind of behavior as well.
p431
aa(lp432
VBG: I'm curious about your relationship with Ed Snowden,
p433
aVbecause you have spoken with him a lot,
p434
aVand you certainly continue doing so,
p435
aVbut in your book, you never call him Edward,
p436
aVnor Ed, you say "Snowden." How come?
p437
aa(lp438
VGG: You know, I'm sure that's something
p439
aVfor a team of psychologists to examine. (Laughter)
p440
aVI don't really know. The reason I think that,
p441
aVone of the important objectives that he actually had,
p442
aVone of his, I think, most important tactics,
p443
aVwas that he knew that one of the ways
p444
aVto distract attention from the substance of the revelations
p445
aVwould be to try and personalize the focus on him,
p446
aVand for that reason, he stayed out of the media.
p447
aVHe tried not to ever have his personal life
p448
aVsubject to examination,
p449
aVand so I think calling him Snowden
p450
aVis a way of just identifying him as this important historical actor
p451
aVrather than trying to personalize him in a way
p452
aVthat might distract attention from the substance.
p453
aa(lp454
VModerator: So his revelations, your analysis,
p455
aVthe work of other journalists,
p456
aVhave really developed the debate,
p457
aVand many governments, for example, have reacted,
p458
aVincluding in Brazil, with projects and programs
p459
aVto reshape a little bit the design of the Internet, etc.
p460
aVThere are a lot of things going on in that sense.
p461
aVBut I'm wondering, for you personally,
p462
aVwhat is the endgame?
p463
aVAt what point will you think,
p464
aVwell, actually, we've succeeded  in moving the dial?
p465
aa(lp466
VGG: Well, I mean, the endgame for me as a journalist
p467
aVis very simple, which is to make sure
p468
aVthat every single document that's newsworthy
p469
aVand that ought to be disclosed
p470
aVends up being disclosed,
p471
aVand that secrets that should never have been kept in the first place
p472
aVend up uncovered.
p473
aVTo me, that's the essence of journalism
p474
aVand that's what I'm committed to doing.
p475
aVAs somebody who finds mass surveillance odious
p476
aVfor all the reasons I just talked about and a lot more,
p477
aVI mean, I look at this as work that will never end
p478
aVuntil governments around the world
p479
aVare no longer able to subject entire populations
p480
aVto monitoring and surveillance
p481
aVunless they convince some court or some entity
p482
aVthat the person they've targeted
p483
aVhas actually done something wrong.
p484
aVTo me, that's the way that privacy can be rejuvenated.
p485
aa(lp486
VBG: So Snowden is very, as we've seen at TED,
p487
aVis very articulate in presenting and portraying himself
p488
aVas a defender of democratic values
p489
aVand democratic principles.
p490
aVBut then, many people really  find it difficult to believe
p491
aVthat those are his only motivations.
p492
aVThey find it difficult to believe
p493
aVthat there was no money involved,
p494
aVthat he didn't sell some of those secrets,
p495
aVeven to China and to Russia,
p496
aVwhich are clearly not the best friends
p497
aVof the United States right now.
p498
aVAnd I'm sure many people in the room
p499
aVare wondering the same question.
p500
aVDo you consider it possible there is
p501
aVthat part of Snowden we've not seen yet?
p502
aa(lp503
VGG: No, I consider that absurd and idiotic.
p504
aV(Laughter) If you wanted to,
p505
aVand I know you're just playing devil's advocate,
p506
aVbut if you wanted to sell
p507
aVsecrets to another country,
p508
aVwhich he could have done and become
p509
aVextremely rich doing so,
p510
aVthe last thing you would  do is take those secrets
p511
aVand give them to journalists and ask journalists to publish them,
p512
aVbecause it makes those secrets worthless.
p513
aVPeople who want to enrich themselves
p514
aVdo it secretly by selling  secrets to the government,
p515
aVbut I think there's one important point worth making,
p516
aVwhich is, that accusation comes from
p517
aVpeople in the U.S. government,
p518
aVfrom people in the media who are loyalists
p519
aVto these various governments,
p520
aVand I think a lot of times when people make accusations like that about other people \u2014
p521
aV"Oh, he can't really be doing this
p522
aVfor principled reasons,
p523
aVhe must have some corrupt, nefarious reason" \u2014
p524
aVthey're saying a lot more about themselves
p525
aVthan they are the target of their accusations,
p526
aVbecause \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p527
aVthose people, the ones who make that accusation,
p528
aVthey themselves never act
p529
aVfor any reason other than corrupt reasons,
p530
aVso they assume
p531
aVthat everybody else is plagued by the same disease
p532
aVof soullessness as they are,
p533
aVand so that's the assumption.
p534
aV(Applause)
p535
aa(lp536
VBG: Glenn, thank you very much. GG: Thank you very much.

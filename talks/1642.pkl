VSo if you've been following the news,
p5
aVyou've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids
p6
aVheaded for the United States,
p7
aVall scheduled to strike within the next 50 years.
p8
aVNow I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal.
p9
aVThat actually wouldn't be such a problem,
p10
aVbecause if we were really all going to die,
p11
aVwe would put aside our differences, we'd spend whatever it took,
p12
aVand we'd find a way to deflect them.
p13
aVI'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way,
p14
aVbut they're wrapped in a special energy field
p15
aVthat polarizes us, and therefore paralyzes us.
p16
aa(lp17
VLast March, I went to the TED conference,
p18
aVand I saw Jim Hansen speak, the NASA scientist
p19
aVwho first raised the alarm about global warming in the 1980s,
p20
aVand it seems that the predictions he made back then
p21
aVare coming true.
p22
aVThis is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises,
p23
aVand if we keep on going the way we're going,
p24
aVwe get a four- or five-degree-Centigrade temperature rise
p25
aVby the end of this century.
p26
aVHansen says we can expect about a five-meter rise in sea levels.
p27
aVThis is what a five-meter rise in sea levels would look like.
p28
aVLow-lying cities all around the world will disappear
p29
aVwithin the lifetime of children born today.
p30
aVHansen closed his talk by saying,
p31
aV"Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth.
p32
aVThat is the equivalent of what we face now.
p33
aVYet we dither, taking no action to deflect the asteroid,
p34
aVeven though the longer we wait,
p35
aVthe more difficult and expensive it becomes."
p36
aVOf course, the left wants to take action,
p37
aVbut the right denies that there's any problem.
p38
aa(lp39
VAll right, so I go back from TED,
p40
aVand then the following week, I'm invited to a dinner party
p41
aVin Washington, D.C., where I know that I'll be meeting
p42
aVa number of conservative intellectuals, including Yuval Levin,
p43
aVand to prepare for the meeting, I read this article by Levin
p44
aVin National Affairs called "Beyond the Welfare State."
p45
aVLevin writes that all over the world,
p46
aVnations are coming to terms with the fact
p47
aVthat the social democratic welfare state
p48
aVis turning out to be untenable and unaffordable,
p49
aVdependent upon dubious economics
p50
aVand the demographic model of a bygone era.
p51
aa(lp52
VAll right, now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid,
p53
aVbut look at these graphs that Levin showed.
p54
aVThis graph shows the national debt
p55
aVas a percentage of America's GDP, and as you see,
p56
aVif you go all the way back to the founding,
p57
aVwe borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War.
p58
aVWars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,
p59
aVand then, oh, what's this? The Civil War. Even more expensive.
p60
aVBorrow a lot of money, pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,
p61
aVget down to near zero, and bang! \u2014 World War I.
p62
aVOnce again, the same process repeats.
p63
aVNow then we get the Great Depression and World War II.
p64
aVWe rise to an astronomical level, around 118 percent of GDP,
p65
aVreally unsustainable, really dangerous.
p66
aVBut we pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, and then, what's this?
p67
aVWhy has it been rising since the '70s?
p68
aVIt's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded,
p69
aVbut it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending,
p70
aVespecially Medicare.
p71
aVWe're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II,
p72
aVand the baby boomers haven't even retired yet,
p73
aVand when they do, this is what will happen.
p74
aVThis is data from the Congressional Budget Office
p75
aVshowing its most realistic forecast of what would happen
p76
aVif current situations and expectations and trends are extended.
p77
aa(lp78
VAll right, now what you might notice is that these two graphs
p79
aVare actually identical, not in terms of the x- and y-axes,
p80
aVor in terms of the data they present,
p81
aVbut in terms of their moral and political implications, they say the same thing.
p82
aVLet me translate for you.
p83
aa(lp84
V"We are doomed unless we start acting now.
p85
aVWhat's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party?
p86
aVCan't you see reality? If you won't help, then get the hell out of the way."
p87
aa(lp88
VWe can deflect both of these asteroids.
p89
aVThese problems are both technically solvable.
p90
aVOur problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper-partisan times,
p91
aVthe mere fact that one side says, "Look, there's an asteroid,"
p92
aVmeans that the other side's going to say, "Huh? What?
p93
aVNo, I'm not even going to look up. No."
p94
aa(lp95
VTo understand why this is happening to us,
p96
aVand what we can do about it, we need to learn more about moral psychology.
p97
aVSo I'm a social psychologist, and I study morality,
p98
aVand one of the most important principles of morality
p99
aVis that morality binds and blinds.
p100
aVIt binds us into teams that circle around sacred values
p101
aVbut thereby makes us go blind to objective reality.
p102
aa(lp103
VThink of it like this.
p104
aVLarge-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet.
p105
aVThere are only a few species that can do it.
p106
aVThat's a beehive. That's a termite mound, a giant termite mound.
p107
aVAnd when you find this in other animals, it's always the same story.
p108
aVThey're always all siblings who are children of a single queen,
p109
aVso they're all in the same boat.
p110
aVThey rise or fall, they live or die, as one.
p111
aVThere's only one species on the planet that can do this
p112
aVwithout kinship, and that, of course, is us.
p113
aVThis is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon,
p114
aVand this is Tenochtitlan.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow how did we do this? How did we go
p117
aVfrom being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago
p118
aVto building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years?
p119
aVIt's miraculous, and part of the explanation
p120
aVis this ability to circle around sacred values.
p121
aVAs you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations.
p122
aVThis is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca.
p123
aVIt's a sacred rock, and when people circle something together,
p124
aVthey unite, they can trust each other, they become one.
p125
aVIt's as though you're moving an electrical wire
p126
aVthrough a magnetic field that generates current.
p127
aVWhen people circle together, they generate a current.
p128
aVWe love to circle around things.
p129
aVWe circle around flags, and then we can trust each other.
p130
aVWe can fight as a team, as a unit.
p131
aVBut even as morality binds people together into a unit,
p132
aVinto a team, the circling blinds them.
p133
aVIt causes them to distort reality.
p134
aVWe begin separating everything into good versus evil.
p135
aVNow that process feels great. It feels really satisfying.
p136
aVBut it is a gross distortion of reality.
p137
aa(lp138
VYou can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress.
p139
aVThis is a graph that shows the degree to which voting
p140
aVin Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis,
p141
aVso that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is,
p142
aVyou know exactly how they voted on all the major issues.
p143
aVAnd what you can see is that,
p144
aVin the decades after the Civil War,
p145
aVCongress was extraordinarily polarized,
p146
aVas you would expect, about as high as can be.
p147
aVBut then, after World War I, things dropped,
p148
aVand we get this historically low level of polarization.
p149
aVThis was a golden age of bipartisanship,
p150
aVat least in terms of the parties' ability to work together
p151
aVand solve grand national problems.
p152
aVBut in the 1980s and '90s, the electromagnet turns back on.
p153
aVPolarization rises.
p154
aVIt used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals
p155
aVcould all work together in Congress.
p156
aVThey could rearrange themselves, form bipartisan committees,
p157
aVbut as the moral electromagnet got cranked up,
p158
aVthe force field increased,
p159
aVDemocrats and Republicans were pulled apart.
p160
aVIt became much harder for them to socialize,
p161
aVmuch harder for them to cooperate.
p162
aVRetiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare.
p163
aVDid anybody notice that in two of the three debates,
p164
aVObama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie?
p165
aVDo you know why they do this?
p166
aVIt's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for. (Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VThe polarization is strongest among our political elites.
p169
aVNobody doubts that this is happening in Washington.
p170
aVBut for a while, there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people.
p171
aVWell, in the last 12 years it's become
p172
aVmuch more apparent that it is.
p173
aVSo look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey.
p174
aVAnd what they do on that survey is they ask
p175
aVwhat's called a feeling thermometer rating.
p176
aVSo, how warm or cold do you feel about, you know,
p177
aVNative Americans, or the military, the Republican Party,
p178
aVthe Democratic Party, all sorts of groups in American life.
p179
aVThe blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel
p180
aVabout Democrats, and they like them.
p181
aVYou know, ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale.
p182
aVRepublicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise.
p183
aVBut when you look at cross-party ratings,
p184
aVyou find, well, that it's lower, but actually,
p185
aVwhen I first saw this data, I was surprised.
p186
aVThat's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations,
p187
aVthey were rating the other party 43, 45. It's not terrible.
p188
aVIt drifts downwards very slightly,
p189
aVbut now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama.
p190
aVIt plummets. Something is going on here.
p191
aVThe moral electromagnet is turning back on,
p192
aVand nowadays, just very recently,
p193
aVDemocrats really dislike Republicans.
p194
aVRepublicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing.
p195
aVIt's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too.
p196
aVIt's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart,
p197
aVpulling left and right into their own territories
p198
aVlike the Bloods and the Crips.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow, there are many reasons why this is happening to us,
p201
aVand many of them we cannot reverse.
p202
aVWe will never again have a political class
p203
aVthat was forged by the experience of fighting together
p204
aVin World War II against a common enemy.
p205
aVWe will never again have just three television networks,
p206
aVall of which are relatively centrist.
p207
aVAnd we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats
p208
aVand liberal northern Republicans making it easy,
p209
aVmaking there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation.
p210
aVSo for a lot of reasons, those decades after the Second World War
p211
aVwere an historically anomalous time.
p212
aVWe will never get back to those low levels of polarization, I believe.
p213
aa(lp214
VBut there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens
p215
aVand dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better,
p216
aVbecause a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly
p217
aVto things that Congress did to itself in the 1990s
p218
aVthat created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution.
p219
aVThese changes are detailed in many books.
p220
aVThese are two that I strongly recommend,
p221
aVand they list a whole bunch of reforms.
p222
aVI'm just going to group them into three broad classes here.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional,
p225
aVhyper-polarized institution, well, the first step is,
p226
aVdo what you can so that fewer hyper-partisans get elected in the first place,
p227
aVand when you have closed party primaries,
p228
aVand only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting,
p229
aVyou're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper-partisans.
p230
aVSo open primaries would make that problem much, much less severe.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress.
p233
aVFrom my experience, and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders,
p234
aVmost of the people going to Congress are good, hard-working,
p235
aVintelligent people who really want to solve problems,
p236
aVbut once they get there, they find that they are forced
p237
aVto play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship
p238
aVand that punishes independent thinking.
p239
aVYou step out of line, you get punished.
p240
aVSo there are a lot of reforms we could do
p241
aVthat will counteract this.
p242
aa(lp243
VFor example, this "Citizens United" ruling is a disaster,
p244
aVbecause it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head,
p245
aVand if you step out of line, if you try to reach across the aisle,
p246
aVthere's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent
p247
aVto make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising.
p248
aa(lp249
VBut the third class of reforms is that we've got to change
p250
aVthe nature of social relationships in Congress.
p251
aVThe politicians I've met are generally very extroverted,
p252
aVfriendly, very socially skillful people,
p253
aVand that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships,
p254
aVmake deals, you've got to cajole, please, flatter,
p255
aVyou've got to use your personal skills,
p256
aVand that's the way politics has always worked.
p257
aVBut beginning in the 1990s, first the House of Representatives
p258
aVchanged its legislative calendar
p259
aVso that all business is basically done in the middle of the week.
p260
aVNowadays, Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning,
p261
aVthey do battle for two days, then they fly home Thursday afternoon.
p262
aVThey don't move their families to the District.
p263
aVThey don't meet each other's spouses or children.
p264
aVThere's no more relationship there.
p265
aVAnd trying to run Congress without human relationships
p266
aVis like trying to run a car without motor oil.
p267
aVShould we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up
p268
aVand descends into paralysis and polarization?
p269
aVA simple change to the legislative calendar,
p270
aVsuch as having business stretch out for three weeks
p271
aVand then they get a week off to go home,
p272
aVthat would change the fundamental relationships in Congress.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo there's a lot we can do, but who's going to push them to do it?
p275
aVThere are a number of groups that are working on this.
p276
aVNo Labels and Common Cause, I think,
p277
aVhave very good ideas for changes we need to do
p278
aVto make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective.
p279
aa(lp280
VBut I'd like to supplement their work
p281
aVwith a little psychological trick, and the trick is this.
p282
aVNothing pulls people together like a common threat
p283
aVor a common attack, especially an attack from a foreign enemy,
p284
aVunless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology,
p285
aVin which case, as I said before, it can actually pull us apart.
p286
aVSometimes a single threat can polarize us, as we saw.
p287
aVBut what if the situation we face is not a single threat
p288
aVbut is actually more like this,
p289
aVwhere there's just so much stuff coming in,
p290
aVit's just, "Start shooting, come on, everybody,
p291
aVwe've got to just work together, just start shooting."
p292
aVBecause actually, we do face this situation.
p293
aVThis is where we are as a country.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo here's another asteroid.
p296
aVWe've all seen versions of this graph, right,
p297
aVwhich shows the changes in wealth since 1979,
p298
aVand as you can see, almost all the gains in wealth
p299
aVhave gone to the top 20 percent, and especially the top one percent.
p300
aVRising inequality like this is associated
p301
aVwith so many problems for a democracy.
p302
aVEspecially, it destroys our ability to trust each other,
p303
aVto feel that we're all in the same boat, because it's obvious we're not.
p304
aVSome of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts.
p305
aVOther people are clinging to a piece of driftwood.
p306
aVWe're not all in the same boat, and that means
p307
aVnobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good.
p308
aVThe left has been screaming about this asteroid for 30 years now,
p309
aVand the right says, "Huh, what? Hmm? No problem. No problem."
p310
aa(lp311
VNow,
p312
aVwhy is that happening to us? Why is the inequality rising?
p313
aVWell, one of the largest causes, after globalization,
p314
aVis actually this fourth asteroid,
p315
aVrising non-marital births.
p316
aVThis graph shows the steady rise of out-of-wedlock births
p317
aVsince the 1960s.
p318
aVMost Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers.
p319
aVWhites are headed that way too.
p320
aVWithin a decade or two, most American children
p321
aVwill be born into homes with no father.
p322
aVThis means that there's much less money coming into the house.
p323
aVBut it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos.
p324
aVAs I know from working with street children in Brazil,
p325
aVMom's boyfriend is often a really, really dangerous person for kids.
p326
aa(lp327
VNow the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s,
p328
aVand the left has been saying, "It's not a problem. It's not a problem."
p329
aVThe left has been very reluctant to say
p330
aVthat marriage is actually good for women and for children.
p331
aVNow let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here.
p332
aVI'm actually more critical of the men
p333
aVwho won't take responsibility for their own children
p334
aVand of an economic system that makes it difficult
p335
aVfor many men to earn enough money to support those children.
p336
aVBut even if you blame nobody, it still is a national problem,
p337
aVand one side has been more concerned about it than the other.
p338
aVThe New York Times finally noticed this asteroid
p339
aVwith a front-page story last July
p340
aVshowing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality.
p341
aa(lp342
VWe are becoming a nation of just two classes.
p343
aVWhen Americans go to college and marry each other,
p344
aVthey have very low divorce rates.
p345
aVThey earn a lot of money, they invest that money in their kids,
p346
aVsome of them become tiger mothers,
p347
aVthe kids rise to their full potential,
p348
aVand the kids go on to become
p349
aVthe top two lines in this graph.
p350
aVAnd then there's everybody else:
p351
aVthe children who don't benefit from a stable marriage,
p352
aVwho don't have as much invested in them,
p353
aVwho don't grow up in a stable environment,
p354
aVand who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo once again, we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing.
p357
aVAs before, we've got a problem, we've got to start working on this,
p358
aVwe've got to do something,
p359
aVand what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat?
p360
aa(lp361
VBut if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders,
p362
aVwe'd see that these two problems actually
p363
aVare best addressed together.
p364
aVBecause if you really care about income inequality,
p365
aVyou might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups
p366
aVthat are working on ways to promote marriage.
p367
aVBut then you're going to run smack into the problem
p368
aVthat women don't generally want to marry someone
p369
aVwho doesn't have a job.
p370
aVSo if you really care about strengthening families,
p371
aVyou might want to talk to some liberal groups
p372
aVwho are working on promoting educational equality,
p373
aVwho are working on raising the minimum wage,
p374
aVwho are working on finding ways to stop so many men
p375
aVfrom being sucked into the criminal justice system and
p376
aVtaken out of the marriage market for their whole lives.
p377
aa(lp378
VSo to conclude, there are at least four asteroids headed our way.
p379
aVHow many of you can see all four?
p380
aVPlease raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit
p381
aVthat all four of these are national problems.
p382
aVPlease raise your hands.
p383
aVOkay, almost all of you.
p384
aa(lp385
VWell, congratulations, you guys are the inaugural members
p386
aVof the Asteroids Club, which is a club
p387
aVfor all Americans who are willing to admit
p388
aVthat the other side actually might have a point.
p389
aVIn the Asteroids Club, we don't start by looking for common ground.
p390
aVCommon ground is often very hard to find.
p391
aVNo, we start by looking for common threats
p392
aVbecause common threats make common ground.
p393
aa(lp394
VNow, am I being naive? Is it naive to think
p395
aVthat people could ever lay down their swords,
p396
aVand left and right could actually work together?
p397
aVI don't think so, because it happens,
p398
aVnot all that often, but there are a variety of examples that point the way.
p399
aVThis is something we can do.
p400
aVBecause Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility,
p401
aVand they've formed dozens of organizations,
p402
aVat the national level, such as this one,
p403
aVdown to many local organizations,
p404
aVsuch as To The Village Square in Tallahassee, Florida,
p405
aVwhich tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate
p406
aVthat sort of working together human relationship
p407
aVthat's necessary to solve Florida's problems.
p408
aVAmericans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS,
p409
aVand on so many humanitarian issues,
p410
aVliberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies,
p411
aVand at times they really have worked together
p412
aVto solve these problems.
p413
aVAnd most surprisingly to me, they sometimes can even see
p414
aVeye to eye on criminal justice.
p415
aVFor example, the incarceration rate, the prison population
p416
aVin this country has quadrupled since 1980.
p417
aVNow this is a social disaster,
p418
aVand liberals are very concerned about this.
p419
aVThe Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting
p420
aVthe prison-industrial complex, fighting to prevent a system
p421
aVthat's just sucking in more and more poor young men.
p422
aVBut are conservatives happy about this?
p423
aVWell, Grover Norquist isn't, because this system
p424
aVcosts an unbelievable amount of money.
p425
aVAnd so, because the prison-industrial complex
p426
aVis bankrupting our states and corroding our souls,
p427
aVgroups of fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives
p428
aVhave come together to form a group called Right on Crime.
p429
aVAnd at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center
p430
aVto oppose the building of new prisons
p431
aVand to work for reforms that will make the justice system
p432
aVmore efficient and more humane.
p433
aa(lp434
VSo this is possible. We can do it.
p435
aVLet us therefore go to battle stations,
p436
aVnot to fight each other,
p437
aVbut to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids.
p438
aVAnd let our first mission be to press Congress
p439
aVto reform itself, before it's too late for our nation.
p440
aa(lp441
VThank you. (Applause)

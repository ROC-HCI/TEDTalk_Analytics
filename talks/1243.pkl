VWhen I was little \u2014
p5
aVand by the way, I was little once \u2014
p6
aVmy father told me a story
p7
aVabout an 18th century watchmaker.
p8
aVAnd what this guy had done:
p9
aVhe used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches.
p10
aVAnd one day, one of his customers came into his workshop
p11
aVand asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought.
p12
aVAnd the guy took it apart,
p13
aVand one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels.
p14
aVAnd as he did so, his customer noticed
p15
aVthat on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving,
p16
aVwere words.
p17
aVAnd he said to the guy,
p18
aV"Why have you put stuff on the back
p19
aVthat no one will ever see?"
p20
aVAnd the watchmaker turned around and said,
p21
aV"God can see it."
p22
aVNow I'm not in the least bit religious,
p23
aVneither was my father,
p24
aVbut at that point, I noticed something happening here.
p25
aVI felt something
p26
aVin this plexus of blood vessels and nerves,
p27
aVand there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere, I guess.
p28
aVBut I felt something.
p29
aVAnd it was a physiological response.
p30
aVAnd from that point on, from my age at the time,
p31
aVI began to think of things in a different way.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd as I took on my career as a designer,
p34
aVI began to ask myself the simple question:
p35
aVDo we actually think beauty,
p36
aVor do we feel it?
p37
aVNow you probably know the answer to this already.
p38
aVYou probably think, well, I don't know which one you think it is,
p39
aVbut I think it's about feeling beauty.
p40
aVAnd so I then moved on into my design career
p41
aVand began to find some exciting things.
p42
aVOne of the most early work was done in automotive design \u2014
p43
aVsome very exciting work was done there.
p44
aVAnd during a lot of this work,
p45
aVwe found something, or I found something,
p46
aVthat really fascinated me, and maybe you can remember it.
p47
aVDo you remember when lights used to just go on and off,
p48
aVclick click, when you closed the door in a car?
p49
aVAnd then somebody, I think it was BMW,
p50
aVintroduced a light that went out slowly.
p51
aVRemember that?
p52
aVI remember it clearly.
p53
aVDo you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that?
p54
aVI remember sitting there thinking, this is fantastic.
p55
aVIn fact, I've never found anybody
p56
aVthat doesn't like the light that goes out slowly.
p57
aVI thought, well what the hell's that about?
p58
aa(lp59
VSo I started to ask myself questions about it.
p60
aVAnd the first was, I'd ask other people: "Do you like it?" "Yes."
p61
aV"Why?" And they'd say, "Oh, it feels so natural,"
p62
aVor, "It's nice."
p63
aVI thought, well that's not good enough.
p64
aVCan we cut down a little bit further,
p65
aVbecause, as a designer, I need the vocabulary, I need the keyboard,
p66
aVof how this actually works.
p67
aVAnd so I did some experiments.
p68
aVAnd I suddenly realized
p69
aVthat there was something that did exactly that \u2014
p70
aVlight to dark in six seconds \u2014
p71
aVexactly that.
p72
aVDo you know what it is? Anyone?
p73
aa(lp74
VYou see, using this bit, the thinky bit,
p75
aVthe slow bit of the brain \u2014 using that.
p76
aVAnd this isn't a think, it's a feel.
p77
aVAnd would you do me a favor?
p78
aVFor the next 14 minutes or whatever it is,
p79
aVwill you feel stuff?
p80
aa(lp81
VI don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it.
p82
aVI felt a sense of relaxation
p83
aVtempered with anticipation.
p84
aVAnd that thing that I found
p85
aVwas the cinema or the theater.
p86
aVIt's actually just happened here \u2014
p87
aVlight to dark in six seconds.
p88
aVAnd when that happens, are you sitting there going,
p89
aV"No, the movie's about to start,"
p90
aVor are you going, "That's fantastic. I'm looking forward to it.
p91
aVI get a sense of anticipation"?
p92
aVNow I'm not a neuroscientist.
p93
aVI don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex.
p94
aVBut it might be.
p95
aVBecause the people I speak to in the northern hemisphere
p96
aVthat used to go in the cinema get this.
p97
aVAnd some of the people I speak to
p98
aVthat have never seen a movie or been to the theater
p99
aVdon't get it in the same way.
p100
aVEverybody likes it,
p101
aVbut some like it more than others.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo this leads me to think of this in a different way.
p104
aVWe're not feeling it. We're thinking beauty is in the limbic system \u2014
p105
aVif that's not an outmoded idea.
p106
aVThese are the bits, the pleasure centers,
p107
aVand maybe what I'm seeing and sensing and feeling
p108
aVis bypassing my thinking.
p109
aVThe wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits
p110
aVis shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit, the cortex.
p111
aVThey arrive first.
p112
aVSo how do we make that actually work?
p113
aVAnd how much of that reactive side of it
p114
aVis due to what we already know,
p115
aVor what we're going to learn, about something?
p116
aa(lp117
VThis is one of the most beautiful things I know.
p118
aVIt's a plastic bag.
p119
aVAnd when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that.
p120
aVThen I found out,
p121
aVpost exposure,
p122
aVthat this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle
p123
aVor a stream filled with coliforms
p124
aVand all sorts of disgusting stuff,
p125
aVthat that filthy water
p126
aVwill migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis
p127
aVand end up inside it as pure, potable drinking water.
p128
aVAnd all of a sudden, this plastic bag
p129
aVwas extremely beautiful to me.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow I'm going to ask you again
p132
aVto switch on the emotional bit.
p133
aVWould you mind taking the brain out,
p134
aVand I just want you to feel something.
p135
aVLook at that. What are you feeling about it?
p136
aVIs it beautiful? Is it exciting?
p137
aVI'm watching your faces very carefully.
p138
aVThere's some rather bored-looking gentlemen
p139
aVand some slightly engaged-looking ladies
p140
aVwho are picking up something off that.
p141
aVMaybe there's an innocence to it.
p142
aVNow I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready?
p143
aVThis is the last act on this Earth
p144
aVof a little girl called Heidi, five years old,
p145
aVbefore she died of cancer to the spine.
p146
aVIt's the last thing she did,
p147
aVthe last physical act.
p148
aVLook at that picture.
p149
aVLook at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it.
p150
aVIs it beautiful now?
p151
aa(lp152
VStop. Stop. How do you feel?
p153
aVWhere are you feeling this?
p154
aVI'm feeling it here. I feel it here.
p155
aVAnd I'm watching your faces,
p156
aVbecause your faces are telling me something.
p157
aVThe lady over there is actually crying, by the way.
p158
aVBut what are you doing?
p159
aVI watch what people do.
p160
aVI watch faces.
p161
aVI watch reactions.
p162
aVBecause I have to know how people react to things.
p163
aVAnd one of the most common faces
p164
aVon something faced with beauty,
p165
aVsomething stupefyingly delicious,
p166
aVis what I call the OMG.
p167
aVAnd by the way, there's no pleasure in that face.
p168
aVIt's not a "this is wonderful!"
p169
aVThe eyebrows are doing this, the eyes are defocused,
p170
aVand the mouth is hanging open.
p171
aVThat's not the expression of joy.
p172
aVThere's something else in that.
p173
aVThere's something weird happening.
p174
aVSo pleasure seems to be tempered
p175
aVby a whole series of different things coming in.
p176
aa(lp177
VPoignancy is a word I love as a designer.
p178
aVIt means something triggering a big emotional response,
p179
aVoften quite a sad emotional response,
p180
aVbut it's part of what we do.
p181
aVIt isn't just about nice.
p182
aVAnd this is the dilemma, this is the paradox, of beauty.
p183
aVSensorily, we're taking in all sorts of things \u2014
p184
aVmixtures of things that are good, bad, exciting, frightening \u2014
p185
aVto come up with that sensorial exposure,
p186
aVthat sensation of what's going on.
p187
aVPathos appears obviously
p188
aVas part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing.
p189
aVAnd also triumph, this sense of transcendence,
p190
aVthis "I never knew that. Ah, this is something new."
p191
aVAnd that's packed in there as well.
p192
aVAnd as we assemble these tools,
p193
aVfrom a design point of view, I get terribly excited about it,
p194
aVbecause these are things, as we've already said,
p195
aVthey're arriving at the brain, it would seem,
p196
aVbefore cognition, before we can manipulate them \u2014
p197
aVelectrochemical party tricks.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow what I'm also interested in is:
p200
aVIs it possible to separate
p201
aVintrinsic and extrinsic beauty?
p202
aVBy that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things,
p203
aVjust something that's exquisitely beautiful,
p204
aVthat's universally beautiful.
p205
aVVery hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it.
p206
aVVery hard to find something that, to everybody,
p207
aVis a very beautiful thing,
p208
aVwithout a certain amount of information packed in there before.
p209
aVSo a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.
p210
aVIt's mediated by information before the comprehension.
p211
aVOr the information's added on at the back,
p212
aVlike that little girl's drawing that I showed you.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow when talking about beauty
p215
aVyou can't get away from the fact
p216
aVthat a lot experiments have been done in this way
p217
aVwith faces and what have you.
p218
aVAnd one of the most tedious ones, I think,
p219
aVwas saying that beauty was about symmetry.
p220
aVWell it obviously isn't.
p221
aVThis is a more interesting one
p222
aVwhere half faces were shown to some people,
p223
aVand then to add them into a list
p224
aVof most beautiful to least beautiful
p225
aVand then exposing a full face.
p226
aVAnd they found that it was almost exact coincidence.
p227
aVSo it wasn't about symmetry.
p228
aVIn fact, this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face,
p229
aVof which both sides are beautiful.
p230
aVBut they're both different.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd as a designer, I can't help meddling with this,
p233
aVso I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this,
p234
aVand tried to understand what the individual elements were,
p235
aVbut feeling it as I go.
p236
aVNow I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty
p237
aVif I look at that eye.
p238
aVI'm not getting it off the eyebrow.
p239
aVAnd the earhole isn't doing it to me at all.
p240
aVSo I don't know how much this is helping me,
p241
aVbut it's helping to guide me to the places
p242
aVwhere the signals are coming off.
p243
aVAnd as I say, I'm not a neuroscientist,
p244
aVbut to understand how I can start to assemble things
p245
aVthat will very quickly bypass
p246
aVthis thinking part
p247
aVand get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again
p250
aVthat we see things not as they are, but as we are.
p251
aVSo I'm going to shamelessly expose something to you,
p252
aVwhich is beautiful to me.
p253
aVAnd this is the F1 MV Agusta.
p254
aVAhhhh.
p255
aVIt is really \u2014 I mean, I can't express to you
p256
aVhow exquisite this object is.
p257
aVBut I also know why it's exquisite to me,
p258
aVbecause it's a palimpsest of things.
p259
aVIt's masses and masses of layers.
p260
aVThis is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.
p261
aVIt's something much bigger.
p262
aVLayer after layer of legend, sport, details that resonate.
p263
aVI mean, if I just go through some of them now \u2014
p264
aVI know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects,
p265
aVand that does it consummately well, you can see it can.
p266
aVSo that's getting me excited.
p267
aVAnd I feel that here.
p268
aa(lp269
VThis bit, the big secret of automotive design \u2014
p270
aVreflection management.
p271
aVIt's not about the shapes,
p272
aVit's how the shapes reflect light.
p273
aVNow that thing, light flickers across it as you move,
p274
aVso it becomes a kinetic object,
p275
aVeven though it's standing still \u2014
p276
aVmanaged by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection.
p277
aVThis little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a rider
p278
aVmeans there's something going on underneath it \u2014
p279
aVin this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably,
p280
aVtaking the power from the engine.
p281
aVI'm getting terribly excited
p282
aVas my mind and my eyes flick across these things.
p283
aa(lp284
VTitanium lacquer on this.
p285
aVI can't tell you how wonderful this is.
p286
aVThat's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel.
p287
aVI'm really getting into this now.
p288
aVAnd of course, a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand,
p289
aVbut this one, because it's a road bike,
p290
aVit all goes away and it folds into this little gap.
p291
aVSo it disappears.
p292
aVAnd then I can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator, which is curved.
p293
aVWhy would you do that?
p294
aVBecause I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics.
p295
aVSo it's more expensive, but it's wonderful.
p296
aVAnd to cap it all,
p297
aVbrand royalty \u2014
p298
aVAgusta, Count Agusta,
p299
aVfrom the great histories of this stuff.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe bit that you can't see is the genius that created this.
p302
aVMassimo Tamburini.
p303
aVThey call him "The Plumber" in Italy,
p304
aVas well as "Maestro,"
p305
aVbecause he actually is engineer
p306
aVand craftsman and sculptor at the same time.
p307
aVThere's so little compromise on this, you can't see it.
p308
aa(lp309
VBut unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like me
p310
aVhave to deal with compromise all the time with beauty.
p311
aVWe have to deal with it.
p312
aVSo I have to work with a supply chain, and I've got to work with the technologies,
p313
aVand I've got to work with everything else all the time,
p314
aVand so compromises start to fit into it.
p315
aVAnd so look at her.
p316
aVI've had to make a bit of a compromise there.
p317
aVI've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter.
p318
aVNo one's noticed, have they yet?
p319
aVDid you see what I did?
p320
aVI moved three things by a millimeter.
p321
aVPretty? Yes.
p322
aVBeautiful? Maybe lesser.
p323
aVBut then, of course, the consumer says that doesn't really matter.
p324
aVSo that's okay, isn't it?
p325
aVAnother millimeter?
p326
aVNo one's going to notice those split lines and changes.
p327
aVIt's that easy to lose beauty,
p328
aVbecause beauty's incredibly difficult to do.
p329
aVAnd only a few people can do it.
p330
aVAnd a focus group cannot do it.
p331
aVAnd a team rarely can do it.
p332
aVIt takes a central cortex, if you like,
p333
aVto be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time.
p334
aa(lp335
VThis is a beautiful water bottle \u2014
p336
aVsome of you know of it \u2014
p337
aVdone by Ross Lovegrove, the designer.
p338
aVThis is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one,
p339
aVas long as you know what water is like
p340
aVthen you can experience this.
p341
aVIt's lovely because it is an embodiment
p342
aVof something refreshing and delicious.
p343
aVI might like it more than you like it,
p344
aVbecause I know how bloody hard it is to do it.
p345
aVIt's stupefyingly difficult
p346
aVto make something that refracts light like that,
p347
aVthat comes out of the tool correctly,
p348
aVthat goes down the line without falling over.
p349
aVUnderneath this, like the story of the swan,
p350
aVis a million things very difficult to do.
p351
aVSo all hail to that.
p352
aVIt's a fantastic example, a simple object.
p353
aVAnd the one I showed you before was, of course, a massively complex one.
p354
aVAnd they're working in beauty
p355
aVin slightly different ways because of it.
p356
aa(lp357
VYou all, I guess, like me,
p358
aVenjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.
p359
aVAnd part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty.
p360
aVYou also may be taking into account the fact that it's incredibly painful.
p361
aVAnybody seen a ballet dancer's toes
p362
aVwhen they come out of the points?
p363
aVWhile she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you,
p364
aVsomething horrible's going on down here.
p365
aVThe comprehension of it
p366
aVleads us to a greater and heightened sense
p367
aVof the beauty of what's actually going on.
p368
aa(lp369
VNow I'm using microseconds wrongly here,
p370
aVso please ignore me.
p371
aVBut what I have to do now, feeling again,
p372
aVwhat I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes,
p373
aVof these triggers into something early on in the process,
p374
aVthat you pick it up,
p375
aVnot through your thinking, but through your feeling.
p376
aVSo we're going to have a little experiment.
p377
aVRight, are you ready? I'm going to show you something for a very, very brief moment.
p378
aVAre you ready? Okay.
p379
aVDid you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash?
p380
aVIt's not.
p381
aVTell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did.
p382
aVDid you think it was modern? Yes you did.
p383
aVThat blip, that information, shot into you before that.
p384
aVAnd because your brain starter motor began there,
p385
aVnow it's got to deal with it.
p386
aVAnd the great thing is, this motorcycle has been styled this way
p387
aVspecifically to engender a sense
p388
aVthat it's green technology and it's good for you
p389
aVand it's light and it's all part of the future.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo is that wrong?
p392
aVWell in this case it isn't,
p393
aVbecause it's a very, very ecologically-sound piece of technology.
p394
aVBut you're a slave of that first flash.
p395
aVWe are slaves to the first few fractions of a second \u2014
p396
aVand that's where much of my work
p397
aVhas to win or lose,
p398
aVon a shelf in a shop.
p399
aVIt wins or loses at that point.
p400
aVYou may see 50, 100, 200 things on a shelf
p401
aVas you walk down it,
p402
aVbut I have to work within that domain,
p403
aVto ensure that it gets you there first.
p404
aa(lp405
VAnd finally, the layer that I love, of knowledge.
p406
aVSome of you, I'm sure, will be familiar with this.
p407
aVWhat's incredible about this,
p408
aVand the way I love to come back to it,
p409
aVis this is taking something that you hate or bores you,
p410
aVfolding clothes,
p411
aVand if you can actually do this \u2014
p412
aVwho can actually do this? Anybody try to do this?
p413
aVYeah?
p414
aVIt's fantastic, isn't it?
p415
aVLook at that. Do you want to see it again?
p416
aVNo time. It says I have two minutes left, so we can't do this.
p417
aVBut just go to the Web, YouTube,
p418
aVpull it down, "folding T-shirt."
p419
aVThat's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt.
p420
aVYou didn't maybe know it.
p421
aVBut how do you feel about it?
p422
aVIt feels fantastic when you do it, you look forward to doing it,
p423
aVand when you tell somebody else about it \u2014 like you probably have \u2014
p424
aVyou look really smart.
p425
aVThe knowledge bubble that sits around the outside,
p426
aVthe stuff that costs nothing,
p427
aVbecause that knowledge is free \u2014
p428
aVbundle that together and where do we come out?
p429
aa(lp430
VForm follows function?
p431
aVOnly sometimes. Only sometimes.
p432
aVForm is function. Form is function.
p433
aVIt informs, it tells us,
p434
aVit supplies us answers before we've even thought about it.
p435
aVAnd so I've stopped using words like "form,"
p436
aVand I've stopped using words like "function" as a designer.
p437
aVWhat I try to pursue now
p438

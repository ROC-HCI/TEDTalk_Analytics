VI was three months pregnant with twins
p5
aVwhen my husband Ross and I went to my second sonogram.
p6
aa(lp7
VI was 35 years old at the time,
p8
aVand I knew that that meant we had a higher risk
p9
aVof having a child with a birth defect.
p10
aVSo, Ross and I researched the standard birth defects,
p11
aVand we felt reasonably prepared.
p12
aa(lp13
VWell, nothing would have prepared us
p14
aVfor the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face.
p15
aVThe doctor explained that one of our twins, Thomas,
p16
aVhad a fatal birth defect called anencephaly.
p17
aVThis means that his brain was not formed correctly
p18
aVbecause part of his skull was missing.
p19
aVBabies with this diagnosis typically die in utero
p20
aVor within a few minutes, hours or days of being born.
p21
aVBut the other twin, Callum,
p22
aVappeared to be healthy, as far as the doctor could tell,
p23
aVand these twins were identical,
p24
aVgenetically identical.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo after a lot of questions about how this could have possibly happened,
p27
aVa selective reduction was mentioned,
p28
aVand while this procedure was not impossible,
p29
aVit posed some unique risks for the healthy twin and for me,
p30
aVso we decided to carry the pregnancy to term.
p31
aVSo there I was, three months pregnant, with two trimesters ahead of me,
p32
aVand I had to find a way to manage my blood pressure and my stress.
p33
aVAnd it felt like having a roommate point a loaded gun at you for six months.
p34
aVBut I stared down the barrel of that gun for so long
p35
aVthat I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
p36
aVWhile there was nothing we could do to prevent the tragedy,
p37
aVI wanted to find a way for Thomas's brief life
p38
aVto have some kind of positive impact.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo I asked my nurse about organ, eye and tissue donation.
p41
aVShe connected with our local organ-procurement organization,
p42
aVthe Washington Regional Transplant Community.
p43
aVWRTC explained to me
p44
aVthat Thomas would probably be too small at birth to donate for transplant,
p45
aVand I was shocked:
p46
aVI didn't even know you could be rejected for that.
p47
aVBut they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research.
p48
aVThis helped me see Thomas in a new light.
p49
aVAs opposed to just a victim of a disease,
p50
aVI started to see him as a possible key to unlock a medical mystery.
p51
aa(lp52
VOn March 23, 2010,
p53
aVthe twins were born, and they were both born alive.
p54
aVAnd just like the doctor said,
p55
aVThomas was missing the top part of his skull,
p56
aVbut he could nurse,
p57
aVdrink from a bottle,
p58
aVcuddle and grab our fingers like a normal baby,
p59
aVand he slept in our arms.
p60
aVAfter six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms
p61
aVsurrounded by our family.
p62
aa(lp63
VWe called WRTC, who sent a van to our home
p64
aVand brought him to Children's National Medical Center.
p65
aVA few hours later, we got a call to say that the recovery was a success,
p66
aVand Thomas's donations would be going to four different places.
p67
aVHis cord blood would go to Duke University.
p68
aVHis liver would go to a cell-therapy company called Cytonet in Durham.
p69
aVHis corneas would go to Schepens Eye Research Institute,
p70
aVwhich is part of Harvard Medical School,
p71
aVand his retinas would go to the University of Pennsylvania.
p72
aa(lp73
VA few days later, we had a funeral with our immediate family,
p74
aVincluding baby Callum,
p75
aVand we basically closed this chapter in our lives.
p76
aVBut I did find myself wondering, what's happening now?
p77
aVWhat are the researchers learning?
p78
aVAnd was it even worthwhile to donate?
p79
aa(lp80
VWRTC invited Ross and I to a grief retreat,
p81
aVand we met about 15 other grieving families
p82
aVwho had donated their loved one's organs for transplant.
p83
aVSome of them had even received letters
p84
aVfrom the people who received their loved one's organs,
p85
aVsaying thank you.
p86
aVI learned that they could even meet each other
p87
aVif they'd both sign a waiver,
p88
aValmost like an open adoption.
p89
aVAnd I was so excited, I thought maybe I could write a letter
p90
aVor I could get a letter and learn about what happened.
p91
aVBut I was disappointed to learn
p92
aVthat this process only exists for people who donate for transplant.
p93
aVSo I was jealous. I had transplant envy, I guess.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VBut over the years that followed,
p98
aVI learned a lot more about donation,
p99
aVand I even got a job in the field.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd I came up with an idea.
p102
aVI wrote a letter that started out,
p103
aV"Dear Researcher."
p104
aVI explained who I was,
p105
aVand I asked if they could tell me why they requested infant retinas
p106
aVin March of 2010,
p107
aVand I asked if my family could visit their lab.
p108
aVI emailed it to the eye bank that arranged the donation,
p109
aVthe Old Dominion Eye Foundation,
p110
aVand asked if they could send it to the right person.
p111
aVThey said that they had never done this before,
p112
aVand they couldn't guarantee a response,
p113
aVbut they wouldn't be an obstacle, and they would deliver it.
p114
aa(lp115
VTwo days later, I got a response
p116
aVfrom Dr. Arupa Ganguly of the University of Pennsylvania.
p117
aVShe thanked me for the donation,
p118
aVand she explained that she is studying retinoblastoma,
p119
aVwhich is a deadly cancer of the retina
p120
aVthat affects children under the age of five,
p121
aVand she said that yes, we were invited to visit her lab.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo next we talked on the phone,
p124
aVand one of the first things she said to me
p125
aVwas that she couldn't possibly imagine how we felt,
p126
aVand that Thomas had given the ultimate sacrifice,
p127
aVand that she seemed to feel indebted to us.
p128
aVSo I said, "Nothing against your study,
p129
aVbut we didn't actually pick it.
p130
aVWe donated to the system, and the system chose your study.
p131
aVI said, "And second of all, bad things happen to children every day,
p132
aVand if you didn't want these retinas,
p133
aVthey would probably be buried in the ground right now.
p134
aVSo to be able to participate in your study
p135
aVgives Thomas's life a new layer of meaning.
p136
aVSo, never feel guilty about using this tissue."
p137
aa(lp138
VNext, she explained to me how rare it was.
p139
aVShe had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier
p140
aVwith the National Disease Research Interchange.
p141
aVShe got only one sample of tissue that fit her criteria,
p142
aVand it was Thomas's.
p143
aa(lp144
VNext, we arranged a date for me to come visit the lab,
p145
aVand we chose March 23, 2015, which was the twins' fifth birthday.
p146
aVAfter we hung up, I emailed her some pictures of Thomas and Callum,
p147
aVand a few weeks later, we received this T-shirt in the mail.
p148
aa(lp149
VA few months later, Ross, Callum and I piled in the car
p150
aVand we went for a road trip.
p151
aVWe met Arupa and her staff,
p152
aVand Arupa said that when I told her not to feel guilty, that it was a relief,
p153
aVand that she hadn't seen it from our perspective.
p154
aVShe also explained that Thomas had a secret code name.
p155
aVThe same way Henrietta Lacks is called HeLa,
p156
aVThomas was called RES 360.
p157
aVRES means research,
p158
aVand 360 means he was the 360th specimen
p159
aVover the course of about 10 years.
p160
aa(lp161
VShe also shared with us a unique document,
p162
aVand it was the shipping label
p163
aVthat sent his retinas from DC to Philadelphia.
p164
aVThis shipping label is like an heirloom to us now.
p165
aVIt's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate might be.
p166
aa(lp167
VArupa also explained that she is using Thomas's retina and his RNA
p168
aVto try to inactivate the gene that causes tumor formation,
p169
aVand she even showed us some results that were based on RES 360.
p170
aVThen she took us to the freezer
p171
aVand she showed us the two samples that she still has
p172
aVthat are still labeled RES 360.
p173
aVThere's two little ones left.
p174
aVShe said she saved it
p175
aVbecause she doesn't know when she might get more.
p176
aVAfter this, we went to the conference room
p177
aVand we relaxed and we had lunch together,
p178
aVand the lab staff presented Callum with a birthday gift.
p179
aVIt was a child's lab kit.
p180
aVAnd they also offered him an internship.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VSo in closing, I have two simple messages today.
p185
aVOne is that most of us probably don't think about donating to research.
p186
aVI know I didn't. I think I'm a normal person.
p187
aVBut I did it.
p188
aVIt was a good experience, and I recommend it,
p189
aVand it brought my family a lot of peace.
p190
aVAnd second is if you work with human tissue
p191
aVand you wonder about the donor and about the family,
p192
aVwrite them a letter.
p193
aVTell them you received it, tell them what you're working on,
p194
aVand invite them to visit your lab,
p195
aVbecause that visit may be even more gratifying for you
p196
aVthan it is for them.
p197
aVAnd I'd also like to ask you a favor.
p198
aVIf you're ever successful in arranging one of these visits,
p199
aVplease tell me about it.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe other part of my family's story
p202
aVis that we ended up visiting all four facilities
p203
aVthat received Thomas's donations.
p204
aVAnd we met amazing people doing inspiring work.
p205
aVThe way I see it now is that Thomas got into Harvard,
p206
aVDuke and Penn \u2014
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd he has a job at Cytonet,
p211
aVand he has colleagues and he has coworkers
p212
aVwho are in the top of their fields.
p213
aVAnd they need him in order to do their job.
p214
aVAnd a life that once seemed brief and insignificant
p215
aVrevealed itself to be vital, everlasting and relevant.
p216
aVAnd I only hope that my life can be as relevant.
p217
aa(lp218
VThank you.

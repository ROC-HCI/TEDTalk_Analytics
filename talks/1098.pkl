VThere's a beautiful statement on the screen that says,
p5
aV"Light creates ambiance, light makes the feel of a space,
p6
aVand light is also the expression of structure."
p7
aVWell, that was not by me.
p8
aVThat was, of course, by Le Corbusier, the famous architect.
p9
aVAnd here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings \u2014
p10
aVthe chapel Notre Dame Du Haut De Ronchamp \u2014
p11
aVwhere he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark.
p12
aVAnd I think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk \u2014
p13
aVthat there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being
p14
aVwithout proper darkness.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo this is how we normally would light our offices.
p17
aVWe have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much Lux
p18
aVand of great uniformity.
p19
aVThis is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other
p20
aVin a regular grid of lamps.
p21
aVAnd that is quite different from what I just showed you
p22
aVfrom Le Corbusier.
p23
aVIf we would apply these codes and standards
p24
aVto the Pantheon in Rome,
p25
aVit would never have looked like this,
p26
aVbecause this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself
p27
aVcan only appear because there is also darkness in that same building.
p28
aVAnd the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said
p29
aVwhen he said, "Light: I make it in my buildings for comfort."
p30
aVAnd he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner
p31
aVas opposed to a one-course meal,
p32
aVbut he really meant the comfort
p33
aVof the quality of the building for the people.
p34
aVHe meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun.
p35
aVAnd he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky,
p36
aVand where you can experience the sun,
p37
aVthat give us a better life in the built environment,
p38
aVjust because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd what it all boils down to is, of course, the sun.
p41
aVAnd this image of the Sun may suggest
p42
aVthat the Sun is something evil and aggressive,
p43
aVbut we should not forget
p44
aVthat all energy on this planet actually comes from the Sun,
p45
aVand light is only a manifestation of that energy.
p46
aa(lp47
VThe sun is for dynamics, for color changes.
p48
aVThe sun is for beauty in our environment,
p49
aVlike in this building \u2014 the High Museum in Atlanta,
p50
aVwhich has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy,
p51
aVtogether with Arup Lighting, a brilliant team of lighting designers,
p52
aVwho created a very subtle modulation of light across the space,
p53
aVresponding to what the sun does outside,
p54
aVjust because of all these beautiful openings in the roof.
p55
aVSo in an indirect way, you can see the sun.
p56
aVAnd what they did is they created an integral building element
p57
aVto improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum.
p58
aVThey created this shade that you can see here,
p59
aVwhich actually covers the sun,
p60
aVbut opens up to the good light from the sky.
p61
aVAnd here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process
p62
aVwith physical models,
p63
aVwith quantitative as well as qualitative methods,
p64
aVto come to a final solution that is truly integrated
p65
aVand completely holistic with the architecture.
p66
aVThey allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way.
p67
aVAs you can see here, there's some direct light on the floor,
p68
aVbut they could easily figure out where that comes from.
p69
aVAnd they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun,
p70
aVthe good part of the sun.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd enjoying the sun can be in many different ways, of course.
p73
aVIt can be just like this,
p74
aVor maybe like this, which is rather peculiar,
p75
aVbut this is in 1963 \u2014
p76
aVthe viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States.
p77
aVAnd it's just a bit bright up there,
p78
aVso these people have found a very intriguing solution.
p79
aVThis is, I think, a very illustrative image of what I try to say \u2014
p80
aVthat the beautiful dynamics of sun, bringing these into the building,
p81
aVcreates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives.
p82
aVAnd this is all about darkness
p83
aVas much as it is about lightness, of course,
p84
aVbecause otherwise you don't see these dynamics.
p85
aa(lp86
VAs opposed to the first office
p87
aVthat I showed you in the beginning of the talk,
p88
aVthis is a well-known office, which is the Weidt Group.
p89
aVThey are in green energy consulting, or something like that.
p90
aVAnd they really practice what they preach
p91
aVbecause this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all.
p92
aVIt has only, on one side, this big, big glass window
p93
aVthat helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space
p94
aVand create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range.
p95
aVSo it can be very dim over there, and you do your work,
p96
aVand it can be very bright over there, and you do your work.
p97
aVBut actually, the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable
p98
aVto all these different light conditions that together create an environment
p99
aVthat is never boring and that is never dull,
p100
aVand therefore helps us to enhance our lives.
p101
aa(lp102
VI really owe a short introduction of this man to you.
p103
aVThis is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago,
p104
aVwhich is the reason I bring him up now, because it's kind of an anniversary year.
p105
aVIn the 1930s, Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe
p106
aVa methodology of modern lighting design.
p107
aVAnd he coined three terms,
p108
aVwhich are "focal glow," "ambient luminescence"
p109
aVand "play of the brilliants" \u2014
p110
aVthree very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture
p111
aVthat all together make up this beautiful experience.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo to begin with, focal glow.
p114
aVHe meant something like this \u2014
p115
aVwhere the light gives direction to the space
p116
aVand helps you to get around.
p117
aVOr something like this,
p118
aVwhich is the lighting design he did for General Motors,
p119
aVfor the car showroom.
p120
aVAnd you enter that space,
p121
aVand you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive,"
p122
aVjust because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle.
p123
aVTo me, it is something from theater,
p124
aVand I will get back to that a little bit later.
p125
aVIt's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus.
p126
aVIt could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds
p127
aVand lights up a patch of the land,
p128
aVhighlighting it compared to the dim environment.
p129
aVOr it can be in today's retail, in the shopping environment \u2014
p130
aVlighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around.
p131
aa(lp132
VAmbient luminescence is something very different.
p133
aVRichard Kelly saw it as something infinite,
p134
aVsomething without any focus,
p135
aVsomething where all details actually dissolve in infinity.
p136
aVAnd I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax
p137
aVand to contemplate.
p138
aVIt could also be something like this:
p139
aVthe National Museum of Science in London,
p140
aVwhere this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries
p141
aVin one large gesture.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd then finally,
p144
aVKelly's play of brilliants added to that
p145
aVreally some play, I think, of the skyline of Hong Kong,
p146
aVor perhaps the chandelier in the opera house,
p147
aVor in the theater here,
p148
aVwhich is the decoration, the icing on the cake, something playful,
p149
aVsomething that is just an addition to the architectural environment,
p150
aVI would say.
p151
aVThese three distinct elements, together,
p152
aVmake a lighting environment that helps us to feel better.
p153
aVAnd we can only create these out of darkness.
p154
aVAnd I will explain that further.
p155
aVAnd I guess that is something that Richard Kelly, here on the left,
p156
aVwas explaining to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe.
p157
aVAnd behind them, you see that Seagram Building
p158
aVthat later turned into an icon of modern lighting design.
p159
aa(lp160
VThose times, there were some early attempts
p161
aValso for light therapy already.
p162
aVYou can see here a photo
p163
aVfrom the United States Library of Medicine,
p164
aVwhere people are put in the sun to get better.
p165
aVIt's a little bit of a different story, this health aspect of light,
p166
aVthan what I'm telling you today.
p167
aVIn today's modern medicine,
p168
aVthere is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way.
p169
aVAnd there is the idea that, when we look at things,
p170
aVit is the yellow light that helps us the most,
p171
aVthat we are the most sensitive for.
p172
aVBut our circadian rhythms,
p173
aVwhich are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep
p174
aVand be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on,
p175
aVthey are much more triggered by blue light.
p176
aVAnd by modulating the amount of blue in our environment,
p177
aVwe can help people to relax, or to be alert,
p178
aVto fall asleep, or to stay awake.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd that is how, maybe in the near future, light can help hospitals
p181
aVto make people better sooner, recover them quicker.
p182
aVMaybe in the airplane, we can overcome jet lag like that.
p183
aVPerhaps in school, we can help children to learn better
p184
aVbecause they concentrate more on their work.
p185
aVAnd you can imagine a lot more applications.
p186
aVBut I would like to talk further
p187
aVabout the combination of light and darkness
p188
aVas a quality in our life.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo light is, of course, for social interaction also \u2014
p191
aVto create relationships with all the features around us.
p192
aVIt is the place where we gather around
p193
aVwhen we have to say something to each other.
p194
aVAnd it is all about this planet.
p195
aVBut when you look at this planet at night,
p196
aVit looks like this.
p197
aVAnd I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today.
p198
aVBecause all this light here goes up to the sky.
p199
aVIt never reaches the ground where it was meant for.
p200
aVIt never is to the benefit of people.
p201
aVIt only spoils the darkness.
p202
aVSo at a global scale, it looks like this.
p203
aVAnd, I mean, that is quite amazing, what you see here \u2014
p204
aVhow much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground.
p205
aVBecause if we look at the Earth the way it should be,
p206
aVit would be something like this very inspiring image
p207
aVwhere darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation
p208
aVand to help us to relate to everything.
p209
aa(lp210
VThe world is changing though,
p211
aVand urbanization is a big driver of everything.
p212
aVI took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou,
p213
aVand I realized that 10 years ago,
p214
aVthere was nothing like this, of these buildings.
p215
aVIt was just a much smaller city,
p216
aVand the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous.
p217
aVAnd we have to understand these main questions:
p218
aVHow do people move through these new urban spaces?
p219
aVHow do they share their culture?
p220
aVHow do we tackle things like mobility?
p221
aVAnd how can light help there?
p222
aVBecause the new technologies,
p223
aVthey seem to be in a really interesting position
p224
aVto contribute to the solutions of urbanization
p225
aVand to provide us with better environments.
p226
aa(lp227
VIt's not that long ago
p228
aVthat our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps.
p229
aVAnd of course, we had the metal-halide lamps
p230
aVand fluorescent lamps and things like that.
p231
aVNow we have LED,
p232
aVbut here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is.
p233
aVAnd this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity,
p234
aVbecause this tiny, tiny size allows us
p235
aVto put the light wherever we really need it.
p236
aVAnd we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all
p237
aVand where we can preserve darkness.
p238
aVSo that is a really interesting proposition, I think,
p239
aVand a new way of lighting the architectural environment
p240
aVwith our well-being in mind.
p241
aVThe problem is, though, that I wanted to explain to you how this really works \u2014
p242
aVbut I can have four of these on my finger,
p243
aVso you would not be able to really see them.
p244
aVSo I asked our laboratory to do something about it,
p245
aVand they said, "Well, we can do something."
p246
aVThey created for me the biggest LED in the world
p247
aVespecially for TEDx in Amsterdam.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo here it is.
p250
aVIt's the same thing as you can see over there \u2014
p251
aVjust 200 times bigger.
p252
aVAnd I will very quickly show you how it works.
p253
aVSo just to explain.
p254
aVNow, every LED that is made these days gives blue light.
p255
aVNow, this is not very pleasant and comfortable.
p256
aVAnd for that reason, we cover the LED with a phosphor cap.
p257
aVAnd the phosphor is excited by the blue
p258
aVand makes the light white and warm and pleasant.
p259
aVAnd then when you add the lens to that,
p260
aVyou can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it
p261
aVwithout any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else.
p262
aVSo you can preserve the darkness and make the light.
p263
aVI just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VThank you.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Applause)
p270
aa(lp271
VWe can go further.
p272
aVSo we have to rethink the way we light our cities.
p273
aVWe have to think again about light as a default solution.
p274
aVWhy are all these motorways permanently lit?
p275
aVIs it really needed?
p276
aVCan we maybe be much more selective
p277
aVand create better environments that also benefit from darkness?
p278
aVCan we be much more gentle with light?
p279
aVLike here \u2014 this is a very low light level actually.
p280
aVCan we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create,
p281
aVso they really want to connect with it, like here?
p282
aVOr can we create simply sculptures
p283
aVthat are very inspiring to be in and to be around?
p284
aVAnd can we preserve the darkness?
p285
aVBecause to find a place like this today on Earth
p286
aVis really very, very challenging.
p287
aVAnd to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult.
p288
aa(lp289
VEven in the oceans, we are creating a lot of light
p290
aVthat we could actually ban
p291
aValso for animal life to have a much greater well-being.
p292
aVAnd it's known that migrating birds, for example, get very disoriented
p293
aVbecause of these offshore platforms.
p294
aVAnd we discovered that when we make those lights green,
p295
aVthe birds, they actually go the right way.
p296
aVThey are not disturbed anymore.
p297
aVAnd it turns out once again
p298
aVthat spectral sensitivity is very important here.
p299
aa(lp300
VIn all of these examples, I think,
p301
aVwe should start making the light out of darkness,
p302
aVand use the darkness as a canvas \u2014 like the visual artists do,
p303
aVlike Edward Hopper in this painting.
p304
aVI think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting.
p305
aVI think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people?
p306
aVWhere have they come from? Where are they going?
p307
aVWhat just happened?
p308
aVWhat will be happening in the next five minutes?
p309
aVAnd it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense
p310
aVbecause of the darkness and the light.
p311
aa(lp312
VEdward Hopper was a real master
p313
aVin creating the narration by working with light and dark.
p314
aVAnd we can learn from that
p315
aVand create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments.
p316
aVWe can do that in commercial spaces like this.
p317
aVAnd you can still also go outside
p318
aVand enjoy the greatest show in the universe,
p319
aVwhich is, of course, the universe itself.
p320
aVSo I give you this wonderful, informative image of the sky,
p321
aVranging from the inner city,
p322
aVwhere you may see one or two stars and nothing else,
p323
aVall the way to the rural environments,
p324
aVwhere you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance
p325
aVof the constellations and the stars.
p326
aa(lp327
VIn architecture, it works just the same.
p328
aVBy appreciating the darkness when you design the light,
p329
aVyou create much more interesting environments
p330
aVthat truly enhance our lives.
p331
aVThis is the most well-known example, Tadao Ando's Church of the Light.
p332
aVBut I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals,
p333
aVwhere light and dark, in very gentle combinations,
p334
aValter each other to define the space.
p335
aVOr Richard MacCormac's Southwark tube station in London,
p336
aVwhere you can really see the sky, even though you are under the ground.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd finally, I want to point out
p339
aVthat a lot of this inspiration comes from theater.
p340
aVAnd I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx
p341
aVin a theater for the first time
p342
aVbecause I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks.
p343
aVIt wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography
p344
aVwithout this theater.
p345
aVAnd I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light.
p346
aa(lp347
VThank you very much.
p348
aa(lp349
V(Applause)

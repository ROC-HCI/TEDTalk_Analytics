VSo, my question:
p5
aVare we alone?
p6
aa(lp7
VThe story of humans is the story of ideas \u2014
p8
aVscientific ideas that shine light into dark corners,
p9
aVideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally,
p10
aVideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed,
p11
aVideas that have vanished in history,
p12
aVand ideas that have been set in dogma.
p13
aVIt's a story of nations,
p14
aVof ideologies,
p15
aVof territories,
p16
aVand of conflicts among them.
p17
aVBut, every moment of human history,
p18
aVfrom the Stone Age to the Information Age,
p19
aVfrom Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip,
p20
aVthey've all been carried out \u2014
p21
aVevery book that you've read,
p22
aVevery poem, every laugh, every tear \u2014
p23
aVthey've all happened here.
p24
aVHere.
p25
aVHere.
p26
aVHere.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VPerspective is a very powerful thing.
p30
aVPerspectives can change.
p31
aVPerspectives can be altered.
p32
aVFrom my perspective, we live on a fragile island of life,
p33
aVin a universe of possibilities.
p34
aVFor many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers,
p35
aVanswers to questions about naturalism and transcendence,
p36
aVabout who we are and why we are,
p37
aVand of course, who else might be out there.
p38
aVIs it really just us?
p39
aVAre we alone in this vast universe
p40
aVof energy and matter and chemistry and physics?
p41
aVWell, if we are, it's an awful waste of space.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVBut, what if we're not?
p44
aa(lp45
VWhat if, out there, others are asking and answering similar questions?
p46
aVWhat if they look up at the night sky, at the same stars,
p47
aVbut from the opposite side?
p48
aVWould the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there
p49
aVinspire us to find ways to survive
p50
aVour increasingly uncertain technological adolescence?
p51
aVMight it be the discovery of a distant civilization
p52
aVand our common cosmic origins
p53
aVthat finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans?
p54
aVWhether we're born in San Francisco, or Sudan,
p55
aVor close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy,
p56
aVwe are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust.
p57
aVWe, all of us,
p58
aVare what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium
p59
aVevolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from.
p60
aVFifty years ago,
p61
aVthe journey to find answers took a different path
p62
aVand SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence,
p63
aVbegan.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, what exactly is SETI?
p66
aVWell, SETI uses the tools of astronomy
p67
aVto try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there.
p68
aVOur own technologies are visible over interstellar distances,
p69
aVand theirs might be as well.
p70
aVIt might be that some massive network of communications,
p71
aVor some shield against asteroidal impact,
p72
aVor some huge astro-engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of,
p73
aVcould generate signals at radio or optical frequencies
p74
aVthat a determined program of searching might detect.
p75
aVFor millennia, we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers
p76
aVfor guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there.
p77
aVNow, we can use the tools of the 21st century to try and observe what is,
p78
aVrather than ask what should be, believed.
p79
aa(lp80
VSETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence;
p81
aVit merely notes the possibility, if not the probability
p82
aVin this vast universe, which seems fairly uniform.
p83
aVThe numbers suggest a universe of possibilities.
p84
aVOur sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy,
p85
aVand we know that many other stars have planetary systems.
p86
aVWe've discovered over 350 in the last 14 years,
p87
aVincluding the small planet, announced earlier this week,
p88
aVwhich has a radius just twice the size of the Earth.
p89
aVAnd, if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life,
p90
aVthere are still 100 billion other galaxies out there,
p91
aValtogether 10^22 stars.
p92
aVNow, I'm going to try a trick, and recreate an experiment from this morning.
p93
aVRemember, one billion?
p94
aVBut, this time not one billion dollars, one billion stars.
p95
aVAlright, one billion stars.
p96
aVNow, up there, 20 feet above the stage,
p97
aVthat's 10 trillion.
p98
aVWell, what about 10^22?
p99
aVWhere's the line that marks that?
p100
aVThat line would have to be 3.8 million miles above this stage.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aV16 times farther away than the moon,
p103
aVor four percent of the distance to the sun.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo, there are many possibilities.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVAnd much of this vast universe,
p108
aVmuch more may be habitable than we once thought,
p109
aVas we study extremophiles on Earth \u2014
p110
aVorganisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us,
p111
aVin the hot, high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean,
p112
aVfrozen in ice, in boiling battery acid,
p113
aVin the cooling waters of nuclear reactors.
p114
aVThese extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe.
p117
aVEven our nearest star, the Sun \u2014
p118
aVits emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed.
p119
aVIt takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us.
p120
aVAnd the nearest star is 4.2 light years away,
p121
aVwhich means its light takes 4.2 years to get here.
p122
aVAnd the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away,
p123
aVand the nearest galaxy to us, 2.5 million light years.
p124
aVThat means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago.
p125
aVAnd a signal would give us a glimpse of their past,
p126
aVnot their present.
p127
aVWhich is why Phil Morrison calls SETI, "the archaeology of the future."
p128
aVIt tells us about their past,
p129
aVbut detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future.
p130
aa(lp131
VI think this is what David Deutsch meant in 2005,
p132
aVwhen he ended his Oxford TEDTalk
p133
aVby saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living,
p134
aVand he would like to carve them on stone tablets.
p135
aVThe first is that problems are inevitable.
p136
aVThe second is that problems are soluble.
p137
aVSo, ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI
p138
aVis the longevity of technologies,
p139
aVand the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos \u2014
p140
aVdistance over space and distance over time.
p141
aVIf technologies don't last and persist,
p142
aVwe will not succeed.
p143
aVAnd we're a very young technology
p144
aVin an old galaxy,
p145
aVand we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo, up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers.
p148
aVLet me talk about a relatively small number.
p149
aVAnd that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless.
p150
aVZircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia,
p151
aVzircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia
p152
aVtell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet
p153
aVthere was abundant water and perhaps even life.
p154
aVSo, our planet has spent the vast majority of its 4.56 billion year history
p155
aVdeveloping life,
p156
aVnot anticipating its emergence.
p157
aVLife happened very quickly,
p158
aVand that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd the other thing that one should take away from this chart
p161
aVis the very narrow range of time
p162
aVover which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet.
p163
aVIt's only the last few hundred thousand years
p164
aVmodern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization.
p165
aVSo, one needs a very deep appreciation
p166
aVof the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet
p167
aVas the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos.
p168
aa(lp169
VWe are not the pinnacle of evolution.
p170
aVWe are not the determined product
p171
aVof billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning.
p172
aVWe are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process.
p173
aVWe are residents of one small planet
p174
aVin a corner of the Milky Way galaxy.
p175
aVAnd Homo sapiens are one small leaf
p176
aVon a very extensive Tree of Life,
p177
aVwhich is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival
p178
aVover millions of years.
p179
aVWe misuse language,
p180
aVand talk about the "ascent" of man.
p181
aVWe understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life
p182
aVbut our ego hasn't caught up yet.
p183
aVSo this "ascent" of man, pinnacle of evolution,
p184
aVhas got to go.
p185
aVIt's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share.
p186
aa(lp187
VLoren Eiseley has said,
p188
aV"One does not meet oneself
p189
aVuntil one catches the reflection from an eye other than human."
p190
aVOne day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien,
p191
aVand the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution
p192
aVthe sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations.
p193
aa(lp194
VWe are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution,
p195
aVand we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story,
p196
aVand perhaps SETI will help as well.
p197
aVOccasionally, throughout history, this concept
p198
aVof this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface,
p199
aVand as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries.
p200
aVSo in 1543, Nicholas Copernicus published "The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres,"
p201
aVand by taking the Earth out of the center,
p202
aVand putting the sun in the center of the solar system,
p203
aVhe opened our eyes to a much larger universe,
p204
aVof which we are just a small part.
p205
aVAnd that Copernican revolution continues today
p206
aVto influence science and philosophy and technology and theology.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo, in 1959, Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison
p209
aVpublished the first SETI article in a refereed journal,
p210
aVand brought SETI into the scientific mainstream.
p211
aVAnd in 1960, Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation
p212
aVlooking at two stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani,
p213
aVfor about 150 hours.
p214
aVNow Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence,
p215
aVbut he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft,
p216
aVand that's that terrestrial technology can interfere
p217
aVwith the search for extraterrestrial technology.
p218
aa(lp219
VWe've been searching ever since,
p220
aVbut it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains.
p221
aVAll of the concerted SETI efforts, over the last 40-some years,
p222
aVare equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans.
p223
aVAnd no one would decide that the ocean was without fish
p224
aVon the basis of one glass of water.
p225
aVThe 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses \u2014
p226
aVmuch bigger glasses.
p227
aVIn Northern California, we're beginning to take observations
p228
aVwith the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array \u2014
p229
aVand I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank
p230
aVPaul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold
p231
aVand all the TeamSETI members in the TED community
p232
aVwho have so generously supported this research.
p233
aV(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
VThe ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes,
p236
aVand hooked together with computers.
p237
aVIt's making silicon as important as aluminum,
p238
aVand we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350
p239
aVfor more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability.
p240
aVToday, our signal detection algorithms
p241
aVcan find very simple artifacts and noise.
p242
aVIf you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft,
p243
aVthe most distant human object in the universe,
p244
aV106 times as far away from us as the sun is.
p245
aVAnd over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.
p246
aVIt may be hard for your eye to see it,
p247
aVbut it's easily found with our efficient algorithms.
p248
aVBut this is a simple signal,
p249
aVand tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals.
p250
aa(lp251
VThis is a very good year.
p252
aV2009 is the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope,
p253
aVDarwin's 200th birthday,
p254
aVthe 150th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species,"
p255
aVthe 50th anniversary of SETI as a science,
p256
aVthe 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit,
p257
aVand of course, the 25th anniversary of TED.
p258
aVAnd next month, the Kepler Spacecraft will launch
p259
aVand will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are,
p260
aVthe targets for SETI's searches.
p261
aVIn 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy,
p262
aVa global festival to help us residents of Earth
p263
aVrediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe.
p264
aVAnd in 2009, change has come to Washington,
p265
aVwith a promise to put science in its rightful position.
p266
aV(Applause)
p267
aa(lp268
VSo, what would change everything?
p269
aVWell, this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year,
p270
aVand four of the respondents said, "SETI."
p271
aVWhy?
p272
aVWell, to quote:
p273
aV"The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth
p274
aVwould eradicate the loneliness and solipsism
p275
aVthat has plagued our species since its inception.
p276
aVAnd it wouldn't simply change everything,
p277
aVit would change everything all at once."
p278
aVSo, if that's right, why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds?
p279
aVI think it's a problem of completion and delivery,
p280
aVbecause the fine print said,
p281
aV"What game-changing ideas and scientific developments
p282
aVwould you expect to live to see?"
p283
aVSo, we have a fulfillment problem.
p284
aVWe need bigger glasses and more hands in the water,
p285
aVand then working together, maybe we can all live to see
p286
aVthe detection of the first extraterrestrial signal.
p287
aa(lp288
VThat brings me to my wish.
p289
aVI wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere
p290
aVto become active participants
p291
aVin the ultimate search for cosmic company.
p292
aa(lp293
VThe first step would be to tap into the global brain trust,
p294
aVto build an environment where raw data could be stored,
p295
aVand where it could be accessed and manipulated,
p296
aVwhere new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient.
p297
aVAnd this is a technically creative challenge,
p298
aVand it would change the perspective of people who worked on it.
p299
aVAnd then, we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight.
p300
aVWe'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye
p301
aVto find faint, complex signals that our current algorithms miss.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd, of course, we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation.
p304
aVWe'd like to take the materials that we have built for education,
p305
aVand get them out to students everywhere,
p306
aVstudents that can't come and visit us at the ATA.
p307
aVWe'd like to tell our story better,
p308
aVand engage young people, and thereby change their perspective.
p309
aa(lp310
VI'm sorry Seth Godin, but over the millennia, we've seen where tribalism leads.
p311
aVWe've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet
p312
aVinto smaller islands.
p313
aVAnd, ultimately, we actually all belong to only one tribe,
p314
aVto Earthlings.
p315
aVAnd SETI is a mirror \u2014
p316
aVa mirror that can show us ourselves
p317
aVfrom an extraordinary perspective,
p318
aVand can help to trivialize the differences among us.
p319
aVIf SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet,
p320
aVthen it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo, in the opening days of 2009,
p323
aVa visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol
p324
aVand said, "We cannot help but believe
p325
aVthat the old hatreds shall someday pass,
p326
aVthat the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve,
p327
aVthat, as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself."
p328
aVSo, I look forward to working with the TED community
p329
aVto hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish,
p330
aVand in collaborating with you,
p331
aVhasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality.
p332
aa(lp333
VThank you.
p334
aV(Applause)

Oliver Chair for SETI. <strong>She led Project Phoenix, a decade-long SETI scrutiny of about 750 nearby star systems</strong>, using telescopes in Australia, West Virginia and Puerto Rico. While no clearly extraterrestrial signal was found, this project was the most comprehensive targeted search for artificially generated cosmic signals ever undertaken. </p><p>Tarter serves on the management board for <strong>the Allen Telescope Array, a massive new instrument that will eventually include 350 antennas, each 6 meters in diameter</strong>. This telescope will increase the speed and the spectral range of the hunt for signals from other distant technologies by orders of magnitude.</p> <p>Tarter is committed to the education of future citizens and scientists. Beyond her scientific leadership at NASA and the SETI Institute, <strong>Tarter has been actively involved in developing curriculum for children.</strong> She was Principal Investigator for two curriculum development projects funded by NSF, NASA, and others. One project, the Life in the Universe series, created 6 science teaching guides for grades 3-9.

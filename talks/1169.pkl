VI'm a contemporary artist
p5
aVwith a bit of an unexpected background.
p6
aVI was in my 20s before I ever went to an art museum.
p7
aVI grew up in the middle of nowhere
p8
aVon a dirt road in rural Arkansas,
p9
aVan hour from the nearest movie theater.
p10
aVAnd I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist
p11
aVbecause I grew up around quirky, colorful characters
p12
aVwho were great at making with their hands.
p13
aVAnd my childhood is more hick
p14
aVthan I could ever possibly relate to you,
p15
aVand also more intellectual than you would ever expect.
p16
aVFor instance, me and my sister, when we were little,
p17
aVwe would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVBut on the other side of that, though,
p20
aVwe were big readers in our house.
p21
aVAnd if the TV was on, we were watching a documentary.
p22
aVAnd my dad is the most voracious reader I know.
p23
aVHe can read a novel or two a day.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut when I was little, I remember,
p26
aVhe would kill flies in our house with my BB gun.
p27
aVAnd what was so amazing to me about that \u2014
p28
aVwell he would be in his recliner, would holler for me to fetch the BB gun,
p29
aVand I'd go get it.
p30
aVAnd what was amazing to me \u2014
p31
aVwell it was pretty kickass; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun \u2014
p32
aVbut what was so amazing to me
p33
aVwas that he knew just enough how to pump it.
p34
aVAnd he could shoot it from two rooms away
p35
aVand not damage what it was on
p36
aVbecause he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly
p37
aVand not damage what it landed on.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I should talk about art.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVOr we'll be here all day with my childhood stories.
p42
aVI love contemporary art,
p43
aVbut I'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world
p44
aVand the contemporary art scene.
p45
aVA few years ago,
p46
aVI spent months in Europe
p47
aVto see the major international art exhibitions
p48
aVthat have the pulse
p49
aVof what is supposed to be going on in the art world.
p50
aVAnd I was struck
p51
aVby going to so many, one after the other,
p52
aVwith some clarity of what it was
p53
aVthat I was longing for.
p54
aVAnd I was longing for several things that I wasn't getting,
p55
aVor not getting enough of.
p56
aVBut two of the main things:
p57
aVone of it, I was longing for more work
p58
aVthat was appealing to a broad public,
p59
aVthat was accessible.
p60
aVAnd the second thing that I was longing for
p61
aVwas some more exquisite craftsmanship
p62
aVand technique.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo I started thinking and listing
p65
aVwhat all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial.
p66
aVSo I decided,
p67
aVI'm going to start my own biennial.
p68
aVI'm going to organize it and direct it
p69
aVand get it going in the world.
p70
aVSo I thought, okay,
p71
aVI have to have some criteria of how to choose work.
p72
aVSo amongst all the criteria I have,
p73
aVthere's two main things.
p74
aVOne of them, I call my Mimaw's Test.
p75
aVAnd what that is
p76
aVis I imagine explaining a work of art
p77
aVto my grandmother in five minutes,
p78
aVand if I can't explain it in five minutes,
p79
aVthen it's too obtuse
p80
aVor esoteric
p81
aVand it hasn't been refined enough yet.
p82
aVIt needs to worked on
p83
aVuntil it can speak fluently.
p84
aVAnd then my other second set of rules \u2014
p85
aVI hate to say "rules" because it's art \u2014
p86
aVmy criteria would be
p87
aVthe three H's,
p88
aVwhich is head, heart and hands.
p89
aVAnd great art would have "head":
p90
aVit would have interesting intellectual ideas
p91
aVand concepts.
p92
aVIt would have "heart" in that it would have passion
p93
aVand heart and soul.
p94
aVAnd it would have "hand" in that it would be greatly crafted.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo I started thinking about
p97
aVhow am I going to do this biennial,
p98
aVhow am I going to travel the world
p99
aVand find these artists?
p100
aVAnd then I realized one day, there's an easier solution to this.
p101
aVI'm just going to make the whole thing myself.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVAnd so this is what I did.
p104
aVSo I thought, a biennial needs artists.
p105
aVI'm going to do an international biennial; I need artists from all around the world.
p106
aVSo what I did was
p107
aVI invented a hundred artists from around the world.
p108
aVI figured out their bios, their passions in life
p109
aVand their art styles,
p110
aVand I started making their work.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
V(Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VI felt, oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing.
p117
aVSo I decided, I'm going to make this a real biennial.
p118
aVIt's going to be two years of studio work.
p119
aVAnd I'm going to create this in two years,
p120
aVand I have.
p121
aVSo I should start to talk about these guys.
p122
aVWell the range is quite a bit.
p123
aVAnd I'm such a technician, so I loved this project,
p124
aVgetting to play with all the techniques.
p125
aVSo for example, in realist paintings,
p126
aVit ranges from this,
p127
aVwhich is kind of old masters style,
p128
aVto really realistic still-life,
p129
aVto this type of painting where I'm painting with a single hair.
p130
aVAnd then at the other end, there's performance and short films
p131
aVand indoor installations
p132
aVlike this indoor installation
p133
aVand this one,
p134
aVand outdoor installations like this one
p135
aVand this one.
p136
aVI know I should mention: I'm making all these things.
p137
aVThis isn't Photoshopped.
p138
aVI'm under the river with those fish.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you.
p141
aVThis is Nell Remmel.
p142
aVNell is interested in agricultural processes,
p143
aVand her work is based in these practices.
p144
aVThis piece, which is called "Flipped Earth" \u2014
p145
aVshe was interested in taking the sky
p146
aVand using it to cleanse barren ground.
p147
aVAnd by taking giant mirrors \u2014
p148
aV(Applause)
p149
aVand here she's taking giant mirrors
p150
aVand pulling them into the dirt.
p151
aVAnd this is 22 feet long.
p152
aVAnd what I loved about her work
p153
aVis, when I would walk around it
p154
aVand look down into the sky,
p155
aVlooking down to watch the sky,
p156
aVand it unfolded in a new way.
p157
aVAnd probably the best part of this piece
p158
aVis at dusk and dawn
p159
aVwhen the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark,
p160
aVbut there's still the light above, bright above.
p161
aVAnd so you're standing there and everything else is dark,
p162
aVbut there's this portal that you want to jump in.
p163
aVThis piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas.
p164
aVAnd I love to dig a hole.
p165
aVSo this piece was great fun
p166
aVbecause it was two days of digging in soft dirt.
p167
aa(lp168
VThe next artist is Kay Overstry,
p169
aVand she's interested in ephemerality and transience.
p170
aVAnd in her most recent project,
p171
aVit's called "Weather I Made."
p172
aVAnd she's making weather
p173
aVon her body's scale.
p174
aVAnd this piece is "Frost."
p175
aVAnd what she did was she went out on a cold, dry night
p176
aVand breathed back and forth on the lawn
p177
aVto leave \u2014
p178
aVto leave her life's mark,
p179
aVthe mark of her life.
p180
aV(Applause)
p181
aVAnd so this is five-foot, five-inches of frost
p182
aVthat she left behind.
p183
aVThe sun rises, and it melts away.
p184
aVAnd that was played by my mom.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo the next artist, this is a group of Japanese artists,
p187
aVa collective of Japanese artists \u2014
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVin Tokyo.
p190
aVAnd they were interested in developing a new, alternative art space,
p191
aVand they needed funding for it,
p192
aVso they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects.
p193
aVOne of these is scratch-off masterpieces.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVAnd so what they're doing \u2014
p196
aVeach of these artists on a nine-by-seven-inch card,
p197
aVwhich they sell for 10 bucks,
p198
aVthey drew original works of art.
p199
aVAnd you buy one, and maybe you get a real piece, and maybe not.
p200
aVWell this has sparked a craze in Japan,
p201
aVbecause everyone's wanting a masterpiece.
p202
aVAnd the ones that are the most sought after
p203
aVare the ones that are only barely scratched off.
p204
aVAnd all these works, in some way,
p205
aVtalk about luck or fate or chance.
p206
aVThose first two
p207
aVare portraits of mega-jackpot winners years before and after their win.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd in this one it's called "Drawing the Short Stick."
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVI love this piece because I have a little cousin at home
p212
aVwho introduced me \u2014 which I think is such a great introduction \u2014
p213
aVto a friend one day as, "This is my cousin Shea.
p214
aVHe draws sticks real good."
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aVWhich is one of the best compliments ever.
p217
aa(lp218
VThis artist is Gus Weinmueller,
p219
aVand he's doing a project, a large project, called "Art for the Peoples."
p220
aVAnd within this project, he's doing a smaller project
p221
aVcalled "Artists in Residence."
p222
aVAnd what he does is \u2014
p223
aV(Laughter)
p224
aVhe spends a week at a time with a family.
p225
aVAnd he shows up on their porch, their doorstep,
p226
aVwith a toothbrush and pajamas,
p227
aVand he's ready to spend the week with them.
p228
aVAnd using only what's present,
p229
aVhe goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of.
p230
aVAnd he spends that week talking to the family
p231
aVabout what do they think great art is.
p232
aVHe has all these discussions with their family,
p233
aVand he digs through everything they have,
p234
aVand he finds materials to make work.
p235
aVAnd he makes a work
p236
aVthat answers what they think great art is.
p237
aVFor this family, he made this still-life painting.
p238
aVAnd whatever he makes
p239
aVsomehow references nesting and space
p240
aVand personal property.
p241
aa(lp242
VThis next project,
p243
aVthis is by Jaochim Parisvega,
p244
aVand he's interested in \u2014
p245
aVhe believes art is everywhere waiting \u2014
p246
aVthat it just needs a little bit of a push to happen.
p247
aVAnd he provides this push by harnessing natural forces,
p248
aVlike in his series where he used rain to make paintings.
p249
aVThis project is called "Love Nests."
p250
aVWhat he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him.
p251
aVSo he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them,
p252
aVand they crafted his nests for him.
p253
aVAnd this one's called "Lovelock's Nest."
p254
aVThis one's called "Mixtape Love Song's Nest."
p255
aV(Laughter)
p256
aVAnd this one's called "Lovemaking Nest."
p257
aV(Laughted)
p258
aa(lp259
VNext is Sylvia Slater.
p260
aVSylvia's interested in art training.
p261
aVShe's a very serious Swiss artist.
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aVAnd she was thinking about her friends and family
p264
aVwho work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries,
p265
aVand she was thinking,
p266
aVwhat can I make that would be of value to them,
p267
aVin case something bad happens
p268
aVand they have to buy their way across the border
p269
aVor pay off a gunman?
p270
aVAnd so she came up with creating
p271
aVthese pocket-sized artworks
p272
aVthat are portraits of the person that would carry them.
p273
aVAnd you would carry this around with you,
p274
aVand if everything went to hell, you could make payments
p275
aVand buy your life.
p276
aVSo this life price
p277
aVis for an irrigation non-profit director.
p278
aVSo hopefully what happens is you never use it,
p279
aVand it's an heirloom that you pass down.
p280
aVAnd she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments,
p281
aVor they could be like these, which are leaves that can be payments.
p282
aVAnd so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones.
p283
aVAnd this one had to get broken up.
p284
aVHe had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently.
p285
aa(lp286
VThis is by a duo, Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland.
p287
aVAnd they're interested in creating culture,
p288
aVjust tradition.
p289
aVSo what they do is they move into an area
p290
aVand try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area.
p291
aVSo this is in Eastern Tennessee,
p292
aVand what they decided was
p293
aVthat we need a positive tradition
p294
aVthat goes with death.
p295
aVSo they came up with "dig jigs."
p296
aVAnd a dig jig \u2014
p297
aVa dig jig is where,
p298
aVfor a milestone anniversary or a birthday,
p299
aVyou gather all your friends and family together
p300
aVand you dance on where you're going to be buried.
p301
aV(Laughter)
p302
aVAnd we got a lot of attention when we did it.
p303
aVI talked my family into doing this, and they didn't know what I was doing.
p304
aVAnd I was like, "Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work."
p305
aVAnd so we got to the grave and made this, which was hilarious \u2014
p306
aVthe attention that we got.
p307
aVSo what happens is you dance on the grave,
p308
aVand after you've done your dance,
p309
aVeveryone toasts you and tells you how great you are.
p310
aVAnd you in essence have a funeral
p311
aVthat you get to be present for.
p312
aVThat's my mom and dad.
p313
aa(lp314
VThis is by Jason Birdsong.
p315
aVHe is interested in how we see as an animal,
p316
aVhow we are interested in mimicry and camouflage.
p317
aVYou know, we look down a dark alley
p318
aVor a jungle path,
p319
aVtrying to make out a face or a creature.
p320
aVWe just have that natural way of seeing.
p321
aVAnd he plays with this idea.
p322
aVAnd this piece: those aren't actually leaves.
p323
aVThey're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage.
p324
aVSo he pairs these up.
p325
aVThere's another pile of leaves.
p326
aVThose are actually all real butterfly specimens.
p327
aVAnd he pairs these up with paintings.
p328
aVLike this is a painting of a snake in a box.
p329
aVSo you open the box and you think, "Whoa, there's a snake in there."
p330
aVBut it's actually a painting.
p331
aVSo he makes these interesting conversations
p332
aVabout realism and mimicry
p333
aVand our drive to be fooled by great camouflage.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VThe next artist is Hazel Clausen.
p338
aVHazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical
p339
aVand decided, "You know, I would learn a lot about culture
p340
aVif I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch."
p341
aVSo that's what she did.
p342
aVShe created the Swiss people named the Uvulites,
p343
aVand they have this distinctive yodeling song
p344
aVthat they use the uvula for.
p345
aVAnd also they reference how the uvula \u2014
p346
aVeverything they say is fallen
p347
aVbecause of the forbidden fruit.
p348
aVAnd that's the symbol of their culture.
p349
aVAnd this is from a documentary
p350
aVcalled "Sexual Practices and Populations Control
p351
aVAmong the Uvulites."
p352
aVThis is a typical angora embroidery for them.
p353
aVThis is one of their founders, Gert Schaeffer.
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aVAnd actually this is my Aunt Irene.
p356
aVIt was so funny having a fake person
p357
aVwho was making fake things.
p358
aVAnd I crack up at this piece,
p359
aVbecause when I see it I know that's French angora
p360
aVand all antique German ribbons
p361
aVand wool that I got in a Nebraska mill
p362
aVand carried around for 10 years
p363
aVand then antique Chinese skirts.
p364
aa(lp365
VThe next is a collective of artists
p366
aVcalled the Silver Dobermans,
p367
aVand their motto is to spread pragmatism
p368
aVone person at a time.
p369
aV(Laughter)
p370
aVAnd they're really interested
p371
aVin how over-coddled we've become.
p372
aVSo this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we've become.
p373
aVAnd what they've done
p374
aVis they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence.
p375
aV(Laughter)
p376
aV(Applause)
p377
aVAnd this is called "Horse Sense Fence."
p378
aa(lp379
VThe next artist is K. M. Yoon,
p380
aVa really interesting South Korean artist.
p381
aVAnd he's reworking a Confucian art tradition
p382
aVof scholar stones.
p383
aVNext is Maynard Sipes.
p384
aVAnd I love Maynard Sipes,
p385
aVbut he's off in his own world,
p386
aVand, bless his heart, he's so paranoid.
p387
aVNext is Roy Penig,
p388
aVa really interesting Kentucky artist,
p389
aVand he's the nicest guy.
p390
aVHe even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese
p391
aVbecause the person wanted it so badly.
p392
aa(lp393
VNext is an Australian artist, Janeen Jackson,
p394
aVand this is from a project of hers
p395
aVcalled "What an Artwork Does When We're Not Watching."
p396
aV(Laughter)
p397
aVNext is by a Lithuanian fortune teller, Jurgi Petrauskas.
p398
aVNext is Ginger Cheshire.
p399
aVThis is from a short film of hers called "The Last Person."
p400
aVAnd that's my cousin and my sister's dog, Gabby.
p401
aVThe next, this is by Sam Sandy.
p402
aVHe's an Australian Aboriginal elder,
p403
aVand he's also an artist.
p404
aVAnd this is from a large traveling sculpture project
p405
aVthat he's doing.
p406
aa(lp407
VThis is from Estelle Willoughsby.
p408
aVShe heals with color.
p409
aVAnd she's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists,
p410
aVeven though she's going to be 90 next year.
p411
aV(Laughter)
p412
aVThis is by Z. Zhou,
p413
aVand he's interested in stasis.
p414
aVNext is by Hilda Singh,
p415
aVand she's doing a whole project called "Social Outfits."
p416
aa(lp417
VNext is by Vera Sokolova.
p418
aVAnd I have to say, Vera kind of scares me.
p419
aVYou can't look her directly in the eyes
p420
aVbecause she's kind of scary.
p421
aVAnd it's good that she's not real;
p422
aVshe'd be mad that I said that.
p423
aV(Laughter)
p424
aVAnd she's an optometrist in St. Petersburg,
p425
aVand she plays with optics.
p426
aVNext, this is by Thomas Swifton.
p427
aVThis is from a short film, "Adventures with Skinny."
p428
aV(Laughter)
p429
aVAnd this is by Cicily Bennett,
p430
aVand it's from a series of short films.
p431
aa(lp432
VAnd after this one, there's 77 other artists.
p433
aVAnd all together with those other 77 you're not seeing,
p434
aVthat's my biennial.
p435
aVThank you. Thank you.
p436
aVThanks.
p437
aV(Applause)
p438
aVThank you. Thanks.

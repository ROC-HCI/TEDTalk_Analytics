VWhat do you guys think?
p5
aVFor those who watched Sir Ken's memorable TED Talk,
p6
aVI am a typical example  of what he describes
p7
aVas "the body as a form of transport for the head,"
p8
aVa university professor.
p9
aa(lp10
VYou might think it was not fair
p11
aVthat I've been lined up to speak after these first two talks
p12
aVto speak about science.
p13
aVI can't move my body to the beat,
p14
aVand after a scientist who became a philosopher,
p15
aVI have to talk about hard science.
p16
aVIt could be a very dry subject.
p17
aVYet, I feel honored.
p18
aVNever in my career,
p19
aVand it's been a long career,
p20
aVhave I had the opportunity to start a talk
p21
aVfeeling so inspired, like this one.
p22
aa(lp23
VUsually, talking about science
p24
aVis like exercising in a dry place.
p25
aVHowever, I've had the pleasure
p26
aVof being invited to come here to talk about water.
p27
aVThe words "water" and "dry" do not match, right?
p28
aVIt is even better to talk about water in the Amazon,
p29
aVwhich is the splendid cradle  of life. Fresh life.
p30
aVSo this is what inspired me.
p31
aVThat's why I'm here, although I'm carrying
p32
aVmy head over here.
p33
aVI am trying, or will try to convey this inspiration.
p34
aVI hope this story will inspire you and that you'll spread the word.
p35
aa(lp36
VWe know that there is controversy.
p37
aVThe Amazon is the "lung of the world,"
p38
aVbecause of its massive power to have vital gases exchanged
p39
aVbetween the forest and the atmosphere.
p40
aVWe also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity.
p41
aVWhile many believe it,
p42
aVfew know it.
p43
aVIf you go out there, in this marsh,
p44
aVyou'll be amazed at the \u2014
p45
aVYou can barely see the animals.
p46
aVThe Indians say, "The forest has more eyes than leaves."
p47
aVThat is true, and I will try to show you something.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut today, I'm going to use a different approach,
p50
aVone that is inspired by these two initiatives here,
p51
aVa harmonic one and a philosophical one.
p52
aVI'll try to use an approach that's slightly materialistic,
p53
aVbut it also attempts to convey that, in nature, there is
p54
aVextraordinary philosophy and harmony.
p55
aVThere'll be no music in my presentation,
p56
aVbut I hope you'll all notice the music of the reality I'm going to show you.
p57
aVI'm going to talk about physiology \u2014 not about lungs,
p58
aVbut other analogies with human physiology,
p59
aVespecially the heart.
p60
aa(lp61
VWe'll start
p62
aVby thinking that water is like blood.
p63
aVThe circulation in our body distributes fresh blood,
p64
aVwhich feeds, nurtures and supports us,
p65
aVand brings the used blood back to be renewed.
p66
aVIn the Amazon, things happen similarly.
p67
aVWe'll start by talking about the power of all these processes.
p68
aVThis is an image
p69
aVof rain in motion.
p70
aVWhat you see there is the years passing in seconds.
p71
aVRains all over the world. What do you see?
p72
aVThe equatorial region, in general,
p73
aVand the Amazon specifically,
p74
aVis extremely important for the world's climate.
p75
aVIt's a powerful engine.
p76
aVThere is a frantic evaporation taking place here.
p77
aa(lp78
VIf we take a look at this other image,
p79
aVwhich shows the water vapor flow,
p80
aVyou have dry air in black, moist air in gray,
p81
aVand clouds in white.
p82
aVWhat you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the Amazon.
p83
aVWhat phenomenon \u2014 if it's not a desert,
p84
aVwhat phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere
p85
aVwith such power  that it can be seen from space?
p86
aVWhat phenomenon is this?
p87
aVIt could be a geyser.
p88
aVA geyser is underground water heated by magma,
p89
aVexploding into the atmosphere
p90
aVand transferring this water  into the atmosphere.
p91
aVThere are no geysers in the Amazon, unless I am wrong.
p92
aVI don't know of any.
p93
aVBut we have something that plays the same role,
p94
aVwith much more elegance though:
p95
aVthe trees, our good old friends
p96
aVthat, like geysers,
p97
aVcan transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere.
p98
aa(lp99
VThere are 600 billion trees in the Amazon forest, 600 billion geysers.
p100
aVThat is done with an extraordinary sophistication.
p101
aVThey don't need the heat of magma.
p102
aVThey use sunlight to do this process.
p103
aVSo, in a typical sunny day in the Amazon,
p104
aVa big tree manages to transfer 1,000 liters of water
p105
aVthrough its transpiration \u2014
p106
aV1,000 liters.
p107
aVIf we take all the Amazon,
p108
aVwhich is a very large area,
p109
aVand add it up to all that water that is released by transpiration,
p110
aVwhich is the sweat of the forest,
p111
aVwe'll get to an incredible number:
p112
aV20 billion metric tons of water.
p113
aVIn one day.
p114
aa(lp115
VDo you know how much that is?
p116
aVThe Amazon River, the largest river on Earth,
p117
aVone fifth of all the fresh water
p118
aVthat leaves the continents of the whole world and ends up in the oceans,
p119
aVdumps 17 billion metric tons of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean.
p120
aVThis river of vapor
p121
aVthat comes up from the forest and goes into the atmosphere
p122
aVis greater than the Amazon River.
p123
aVJust to give you an idea.
p124
aVIf we could take a gigantic kettle,
p125
aVthe kind you could plug into a power socket, an electric one,
p126
aVand put those 20 billion metric tons of water in it,
p127
aVhow much power would you need to have this water evaporated?
p128
aVAny idea? A really big kettle.
p129
aVA gigantic kettle, right?
p130
aV50 thousand Itaipus.
p131
aVItaipu is still the largest hydroelectric plant in the world.
p132
aVand Brazil is very proud of it
p133
aVbecause it provides more  than 30 percent of the power
p134
aVthat is consumed in Brazil.
p135
aVAnd the Amazon is here, doing this for free.
p136
aVIt's a vivid and extremely powerful plant, providing environmental services.
p137
aa(lp138
VRelated to this subject,
p139
aVwe are going to talk about what I call the paradox of chance,
p140
aVwhich is curious.
p141
aVIf you look at the world map \u2014
p142
aVit's easy to see this \u2014
p143
aVyou'll see that there are forests in the equatorial zone,
p144
aVand deserts are organized at 30 degrees north latitude,
p145
aV30 degrees south latitude, aligned.
p146
aVLook over there, in the southern hemisphere, the Atacama;
p147
aVNamibia and Kalahari in Africa; the Australian desert.
p148
aVIn the northern hemisphere, the Sahara, Sonoran, etc.
p149
aVThere is an exception, and it's curious:
p150
aVIt's the quadrangle that ranges from Cuiabá to Buenos Aires,
p151
aVand from São Paulo to the Andes.
p152
aVThis quadrangle was supposed to be a desert.
p153
aVIt's on the line of deserts.
p154
aVWhy isn't it? That's why I call it the paradox of chance.
p155
aVWhat do we have in South America that is different?
p156
aa(lp157
VIf we could use the analogy
p158
aVof the blood circulating in our bodies,
p159
aVlike the water circulating in the landscape,
p160
aVwe see that rivers are veins,
p161
aVthey drain the landscape, they drain the tissue of nature.
p162
aVWhere are the arteries?
p163
aVAny guess?
p164
aVWhat takes \u2014
p165
aVHow does water get to irrigate the tissues of nature
p166
aVand bring everything back through rivers?
p167
aVThere is a new type of river,
p168
aVwhich originates in the blue sea,
p169
aVwhich flows through the green ocean \u2014
p170
aVit not only flows, but it is also pumped by the green ocean \u2014
p171
aVand then it falls on our land.
p172
aVAll our economy, that quadrangle,
p173
aV70 percent of South America's  GDP comes from that area.
p174
aVIt depends on this river.
p175
aVThis river flows invisibly above us.
p176
aVWe are floating here on this floating hotel,
p177
aVon one of the largest rivers on Earth, the Negro River.
p178
aVIt's a bit dry and rough, but we are floating here,
p179
aVand there is this invisible river running above us.
p180
aa(lp181
VThis river has a pulse.
p182
aVHere it is, pulsing.
p183
aVThat's why we also talk about the heart.
p184
aVYou can see the different seasons there.
p185
aVThere's the rainy season. In the Amazon, we used to have two seasons,
p186
aVthe humid season and the even more humid season.
p187
aVNow we have a dry season.
p188
aVYou can see the river covering that region
p189
aVwhich, otherwise, would be a desert. And it is not.
p190
aa(lp191
VWe, scientists \u2014 You see that I'm struggling here
p192
aVto move my head from one side to the other.
p193
aVScientists study how it works, why, etc.
p194
aVand these studies are generating a series of discoveries,
p195
aVwhich are absolutely fabulous,
p196
aVto raise our awareness of the wealth,
p197
aVthe complexity, and the wonder that we have,
p198
aVthe symphony we have in this process.
p199
aVOne of them is: How is rain formed?
p200
aVAbove the Amazon, there is clean air,
p201
aVas there is clean air above the ocean.
p202
aVThe blue sea has clean air above it and forms pretty few clouds;
p203
aVthere's almost no rain there.
p204
aVThe green ocean has the same clean air, but forms a lot of rain.
p205
aVWhat is happening here that is different?
p206
aa(lp207
VThe forest emits smells,
p208
aVand these smells are condensation nuclei,
p209
aVwhich form drops in the atmosphere.
p210
aVThen, clouds are formed and there is torrential rain.
p211
aVThe sprinkler of the Garden of Eden.
p212
aVThis relation between a living thing, which is the forest,
p213
aVand a nonliving thing, which is the atmosphere,
p214
aVis ingenious in the Amazon,
p215
aVbecause the forest provides water and seeds,
p216
aVand the atmosphere forms the rain and gives water back,
p217
aVguaranteeing the forest's survival.
p218
aa(lp219
VThere are other factors as well.
p220
aVWe've talked a little about the heart,
p221
aVand let's now talk about another function: the liver!
p222
aVWhen humid air, high humidity and radiation are combined
p223
aVwith these organic compounds,
p224
aVwhich I call exogenous vitamin C, generous vitamin C in the form of gas,
p225
aVthe plants release antioxidants
p226
aVwhich react with pollutants.
p227
aVYou can rest assured
p228
aVthat you are breathing the purest air on Earth, here in the Amazon,
p229
aVbecause the plants take care of this characteristic as well.
p230
aVThis benefits the very way plants work,
p231
aVwhich is another ingenious cycle.
p232
aa(lp233
VSpeaking of fractals,
p234
aVand their relation with the way we work,
p235
aVwe can establish other comparisons.
p236
aVAs in the upper airways of our lungs,
p237
aVthe air in the Amazon gets cleaned up from the excess of dust.
p238
aVThe dust in the air that we breathe is cleaned by our airways.
p239
aVThis keeps the excess of dust from affecting the rainfall.
p240
aVWhen there are fires in the Amazon,
p241
aVthe smoke stops the rain,  it stops raining,
p242
aVthe forest dries up and catches fire.
p243
aVThere is another fractal analogy.
p244
aVLike in the veins and arteries,
p245
aVthe rain water is a feedback.
p246
aVIt returns to the atmosphere.
p247
aVLike endocrinal glands and hormones,
p248
aVthere are those gases which I told you about before,
p249
aVthat are formed and released into the atmosphere, like hormones,
p250
aVwhich help in the formation of rain.
p251
aVLike the liver and the kidneys, as I've said, cleaning the air.
p252
aVAnd, finally, like the heart:
p253
aVpumping water from outside, from the sea,
p254
aVinto the forest.
p255
aVWe call it the biotic moisture pump,
p256
aVa new theory that is explained in a very simple way.
p257
aa(lp258
VIf there is a desert in the continent
p259
aVwith a nearby sea,
p260
aVevaporation's greater on the sea,
p261
aVand it sucks the air above the desert.
p262
aVThe desert is trapped in this condition. It will always be dry.
p263
aVIf you have the opposite situation, a forest,
p264
aVthe evaporation, as we showed, is much greater, because of the trees,
p265
aVand this relation is reversed.
p266
aVThe air above the sea is sucked into the continent
p267
aVand humidity is imported.
p268
aVThis satellite image was taken one month ago \u2014
p269
aVthat's Manaus down there, we're down there \u2014
p270
aVand it shows this process.
p271
aVIt's not a common little river that flows into a canal.
p272
aVIt's a mighty river that irrigates South America,
p273
aVamong other things.
p274
aVThis image shows those paths,
p275
aVall the hurricanes that have been recorded.
p276
aVYou can see that, in the red square, there hardly are any hurricanes.
p277
aVThat is no accident.
p278
aVThis pump that sucks the moisture into the continent
p279
aValso speeds up the air above the sea,
p280
aVand this prevents hurricane formations.
p281
aa(lp282
VTo close this part and sum up,
p283
aVI'd like to talk about something a little different.
p284
aVI have several colleagues
p285
aVwho worked in the development of these theories.
p286
aVThey think, and so do I,
p287
aVthat we can save planet Earth.
p288
aVI'm not talking only about the Amazon.
p289
aVThe Amazon teaches us a lesson
p290
aVon how pristine nature works.
p291
aVWe didn't understand these processes before
p292
aVbecause the rest of the world is messed up.
p293
aVWe could understand it here, though.
p294
aVThese colleagues propose that, yes, we can
p295
aVsave other areas,
p296
aVincluding deserts.
p297
aVIf we could establish forests in those other areas,
p298
aVwe can reverse climate change,
p299
aVincluding global warming.
p300
aa(lp301
VI have a dear colleague in India,
p302
aVwhose name is Suprabha Seshan, and she has a motto.
p303
aVHer motto is, "Gardening back the biosphere,"
p304
aV"Reajardinando a biosfera" in Portuguese.
p305
aVShe does a wonderful job rebuilding ecosystems.
p306
aVWe need to do this.
p307
aVHaving closed this quick introduction,
p308
aVwe see the reality that we have out here,
p309
aVwhich is drought, this climate change,
p310
aVthings that we already knew.
p311
aa(lp312
VI'd like to tell you a short story.
p313
aVOnce, about four years ago,
p314
aVI attended a declamation, of a text by Davi Kopenawa,
p315
aVa wise representative of the Yanomami people,
p316
aVand it went more or less like this:
p317
aV"Doesn't the white man know
p318
aVthat, if he destroys the forest, there will be no more rain?
p319
aVAnd that, if there's no more rain,
p320
aVthere'll be nothing to drink, or to eat?"
p321
aVI heard that, and my eyes welled up
p322
aVand I went, "Oh, my!
p323
aVI've been studying this for 20 years, with a super computer,
p324
aVdozens, thousands of scientists,
p325
aVand we are starting to get to this conclusion, which he already knows!"
p326
aVA critical point is the Yanomami have never deforested.
p327
aVHow could they know the rain would end?
p328
aVThis bugged me and I was befuddled.
p329
aVHow could he know that?
p330
aa(lp331
VSome months later, I met him at another event and said,
p332
aV"Davi, how did you know that if the forest was destroyed, there'd be no more rain?"
p333
aVHe replied: "The spirit of the forest told us."
p334
aVFor me, this was a game changer,
p335
aVa radical change.
p336
aVI said, "Gosh!
p337
aVWhy am I doing all this science
p338
aVto get to a conclusion that he already knows?"
p339
aVThen, something  absolutely critical hit me,
p340
aVwhich is,
p341
aVseeing is believing.
p342
aVOut of sight, out of mind.
p343
aVThis is a need the previous speaker pointed out:
p344
aVWe need to see things \u2014
p345
aVI mean, we, Western society,
p346
aVwhich is becoming global, civilized \u2014
p347
aVwe need to see.
p348
aVIf we don't see, we don't register the information.
p349
aVWe live in ignorance.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo, I propose the following \u2014
p352
aVof course, the astronomer wouldn't like the idea \u2014
p353
aVbut let's turn the Hubble telescope upside down.
p354
aVAnd let's make it look down here,
p355
aVrather than to the far reaches of the universe.
p356
aVThe universe is wonderful,
p357
aVbut we have a practical reality,
p358
aVwhich is we live in an unknown cosmos,
p359
aVand we're ignorant about it.
p360
aVWe're trampling on this wonderful cosmos
p361
aVthat shelters us and houses us.
p362
aVTalk to any astrophysicist.
p363
aVThe Earth is a statistical improbability.
p364
aVThe stability and comfort that we enjoy, despite the droughts of the Negro River,
p365
aVand all the heat and cold and typhoons, etc.,
p366
aVthere is nothing like it in the universe, that we know of.
p367
aa(lp368
VThen, let's turn Hubble in our direction,
p369
aVand let's look at the Earth.
p370
aVLet's start with the Amazon!
p371
aVLet's dive,
p372
aVlet's reach out the reality we live in every day,
p373
aVand look carefully at it, since that's what we need.
p374
aVDavi Kopenawa doesn't need this.
p375
aVHe has something already that I think I missed.
p376
aVI was educated by television.
p377
aVI think that I missed this,
p378
aVan ancestral record,
p379
aVa valuation of what I don't know, what I haven't seen.
p380
aVHe is not a doubting Thomas.
p381
aVHe believes,  with veneration and reverence,
p382
aVin what his ancestors and the spirits taught him.
p383
aVWe can't do it, so let's look into the forest.
p384
aVEven with Hubble up there \u2014
p385
aVthis is a bird's-eye view, right?
p386
aVEven when this happens,
p387
aVwe also see something that we don't know.
p388
aVThe Spanish called it the green inferno.
p389
aVIf you go out there into the bushes and get lost,
p390
aVand, let's say, if you head west,
p391
aVit's 900 kilometers to Colombia,
p392
aVand another 1,000 to somewhere else.
p393
aVSo, you can figure out why they called it the green inferno.
p394
aa(lp395
VBut go and look at what is in there.
p396
aVIt is a live carpet.
p397
aVEach color you see is a tree species.
p398
aVEach tree, each tree top,
p399
aVhas up to 10,000 species of insects in it,
p400
aVlet alone the millions of species of fungi, bacteria, etc.
p401
aVAll invisible.
p402
aVAll of it is an even stranger cosmos to us
p403
aVthan the galaxies billions of light years away from the Earth,
p404
aVwhich Hubble brings to our newspapers everyday.
p405
aa(lp406
VI'm going to end my talk here \u2014
p407
aVI have a few seconds left \u2014
p408
aVby showing you this wonderful being.
p409
aVWhen we see the morpho butterfly in the forest,
p410
aVwe feel like someone's left open the door to heaven,
p411
aVand this creature escaped from there, because it's so beautiful.
p412
aVHowever, I cannot finish
p413
aVwithout showing you a tech side.
p414
aVWe are tech-arrogant.
p415
aVWe deprive nature of its technology.
p416
aVA robotic hand is technological,
p417
aVmine is biological,
p418
aVand we don't think about it anymore.
p419
aa(lp420
VLet's then look at the morpho butterfly,
p421
aVan example of an invisible technological competence of life,
p422
aVwhich is at the very heart of our possibility of surviving on this planet,
p423
aVand let's zoom in on it. Again, Hubble is there.
p424
aVLet's get into the butterfly's wings.
p425
aVScholars have tried to explain: Why is it blue?
p426
aVLet's zoom in on it.
p427
aVWhat you see is that the architecture of the invisible humiliates
p428
aVthe best architects in the world.
p429
aVAll of this on a tiny scale.
p430
aVBesides its beauty and functioning, there is another side to it.
p431
aVIn nature,
p432
aVall that is organized in extraordinary structures has a function.
p433
aVThis function of the morpho butterfly \u2014 it is not blue;
p434
aVit does not have blue pigments.
p435
aVIt has photonic crystals on its surface, according to people who studied it,
p436
aVwhich are extremely  sophisticated crystals.
p437
aVOur technology had nothing like that at the time.
p438
aVHitachi has now made a monitor
p439
aVthat uses this technology,
p440
aVand it is used in optical fibers to transmit \u2014
p441
aVJanine Benyus, who's been here several times, talks about it: biomimetics.
p442
aVMy time's up.
p443
aa(lp444
VThen, I'll wrap it up with what is at the base of this capacity,
p445
aVof this competence of biodiversity,
p446

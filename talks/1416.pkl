VHi, my name is Frank,
p5
aVand I collect secrets.
p6
aVIt all started with a crazy idea
p7
aVin November of 2004.
p8
aVI printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards,
p9
aVjust like this.
p10
aVThey were blank on one side,
p11
aVand on the other side
p12
aVI listed some simple instructions.
p13
aVI asked people to anonymously share an artful secret
p14
aVthey'd never told anyone before.
p15
aVAnd I handed out these postcards randomly
p16
aVon the streets of Washington, D.C.,
p17
aVnot knowing what to expect.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut soon the idea began spreading virally.
p20
aVPeople began to buy their own postcards
p21
aVand make their own postcards.
p22
aVI started receiving secrets in my home mailbox,
p23
aVnot just with postmarks from Washington, D.C.,
p24
aVbut from Texas, California,
p25
aVVancouver, New Zealand, Iraq.
p26
aVSoon my crazy idea didn't seem so crazy.
p27
aVPostSecret.com
p28
aVis the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world.
p29
aVAnd this is my postcard collection today.
p30
aVYou can see my wife
p31
aVstruggling to stack a brick of postcards
p32
aVon a pyramid of over a half-million secrets.
p33
aa(lp34
VWhat I'd like to do now
p35
aVis share with you a very special handful of secrets
p36
aVfrom that collection,
p37
aVstarting with this one.
p38
aV"I found these stamps as a child,
p39
aVand I have been waiting all my life
p40
aVto have someone to send them to.
p41
aVI never did have someone."
p42
aVSecrets can take many forms.
p43
aVThey can be shocking
p44
aVor silly or soulful.
p45
aVThey can connect us to our deepest humanity
p46
aVor with people we'll never meet.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVMaybe one of you sent this one in.
p49
aVI don't know.
p50
aVThis one does a great job of demonstrating
p51
aVthe creativity that people have
p52
aVwhen they make and mail me a postcard.
p53
aVThis one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup
p54
aVwith a stamp and my home address written on the other side.
p55
aa(lp56
V"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents.
p57
aVI've found love. I'm happy."
p58
aVSecrets can remind us of the countless human dramas,
p59
aVof frailty and heroism,
p60
aVplaying out silently
p61
aVin the lives of people all around us
p62
aVeven now.
p63
aV"Everyone who knew me before 9/11
p64
aVbelieves I'm dead."
p65
aV"I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people,
p66
aVso sometimes I didn't wear panties,
p67
aVand just had a big smile and chuckled to myself."
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VThis next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you.
p72
aVI love to speak on college campuses
p73
aVand share secrets and the stories with students.
p74
aVAnd sometimes afterwards I'll stick around
p75
aVand sign books and take photos with students.
p76
aVAnd this next postcard was made
p77
aVout of one of those photos.
p78
aVAnd I should also mention that, just like today,
p79
aVat that PostSecret event,
p80
aVI was using a wireless microphone.
p81
aV"Your mic wasn't off during sound check.
p82
aVWe all heard you pee."
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVThis was really embarrassing when it happened,
p85
aVuntil I realized it could have been worse.
p86
aVRight. You know what I'm saying.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
V"Inside this envelope
p91
aVis the ripped up remains
p92
aVof a suicide note I didn't use.
p93
aVI feel like the happiest person on Earth (now.)"
p94
aV"One of these men is the father of my son.
p95
aVHe pays me a lot to keep it a secret."
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
V"That Saturday when you wondered where I was,
p100
aVwell, I was getting your ring.
p101
aVIt's in my pocket right now."
p102
aVI had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog
p103
aVtwo years ago on Valentine's Day.
p104
aVIt was the very bottom, the last secret in the long column.
p105
aVAnd it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours
p106
aVbefore I received this exuberant email
p107
aVfrom the guy who mailed me this postcard.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd he said, "Frank, I've got to share with you
p110
aVthis story that just played out in my life."
p111
aVHe said, "My knees are still shaking."
p112
aVHe said, "For three years, my girlfriend and I,
p113
aVwe've made it this Sunday morning ritual
p114
aVto visit the PostSecret blog together
p115
aVand read the secrets out loud.
p116
aVI read some to her, she reads some to me."
p117
aVHe says, "It's really brought us closer together
p118
aVthrough the years.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd so when I discovered
p121
aVthat you had posted
p122
aVmy surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom,
p123
aVI was beside myself.
p124
aVAnd I tried to act calm, not to give anything away.
p125
aVAnd just like every Sunday,
p126
aVwe started reading the secrets out loud to each other."
p127
aVHe said, "But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever
p128
aVto get through each one."
p129
aVBut she finally did.
p130
aVShe got to that bottom secret, his proposal to her.
p131
aVAnd he said, "She read it once and then she read it again."
p132
aVAnd she turned to him and said,
p133
aV"Is that our cat?"
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVAnd when she saw him,
p136
aVhe was down on one knee, he had the ring out.
p137
aVHe popped the question, she said yes. It was a very happy ending.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo I emailed him back
p140
aVand I said, "Please share with me an image, something,
p141
aVthat I can share with the whole PostSecret community
p142
aVand let everyone know your fairy tale ending."
p143
aVAnd he emailed me this picture.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
V"I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer.
p148
aVI finally got the pictures developed
p149
aVand I'd love to give them to you."
p150
aVThis picture never got returned back
p151
aVto the people who lost it,
p152
aVbut this secret has impacted many lives,
p153
aVstarting with a student up in Canada
p154
aVnamed Matty.
p155
aVMatty was inspired by that secret
p156
aVto start his own website,
p157
aVa website called IFoundYourCamera.
p158
aVMatty invites people
p159
aVto mail him digital cameras that they've found,
p160
aVmemory sticks that have been lost
p161
aVwith orphan photos.
p162
aVAnd Matty takes the pictures off these cameras
p163
aVand posts them on his website every week.
p164
aVAnd people come to visit
p165
aVto see if they can identify a picture they've lost
p166
aVor help somebody else get the photos back to them
p167
aVthat they might be desperately searching for.
p168
aVThis one's my favorite.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VMatty has found this ingenious way
p173
aVto leverage the kindness of strangers.
p174
aVAnd it might seem like a simple idea, and it is,
p175
aVbut the impact it can have on people's lives can be huge.
p176
aVMatty shared with me
p177
aVan emotional email he received
p178
aVfrom the mother in that picture.
p179
aV"That's me, my husband and son.
p180
aVThe other pictures are of my very ill grandmother.
p181
aVThank you for making your site.
p182
aVThese pictures mean more to me than you know.
p183
aVMy son's birth is on this camera.
p184
aVHe turns four tomorrow."
p185
aVEvery picture that you see there
p186
aVand thousands of others
p187
aVhave been returned back to the person who lost it \u2014
p188
aVsometimes crossing oceans,
p189
aVsometimes going through language barriers.
p190
aa(lp191
VThis is the last postcard I have to share with you today.
p192
aV"When people I love
p193
aVleave voicemails on my phone
p194
aVI always save them in case they die tomorrow
p195
aVand I have no other way
p196
aVof hearing their voice ever again."
p197
aVWhen I posted this secret,
p198
aVdozens of people
p199
aVsent voicemail messages from their phones,
p200
aVsometimes ones they'd been keeping for years,
p201
aVmessages from family or friends
p202
aVwho had died.
p203
aVThey said that by preserving those voices
p204
aVand sharing them,
p205
aVit helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive.
p206
aVOne young girl
p207
aVposted the last message
p208
aVshe ever heard from her grandmother.
p209
aa(lp210
VSecrets can take many forms.
p211
aVThey can be shocking or silly
p212
aVor soulful.
p213
aVThey can connect us with our deepest humanity
p214
aVor with people we'll never meet again.
p215
aa(lp216
VVoicemail recording: First saved voice message.
p217
aVGrandma: \u266b It's somebody's birthday today \u266b
p218
aV\u266b Somebody's birthday today \u266b
p219
aV\u266b The candles are lighted \u266b
p220
aV\u266b on somebody's cake \u266b
p221
aV\u266b And we're all invited \u266b
p222
aV\u266b for somebody's sake \u266b
p223
aVYou're 21 years old today.
p224
aVHave a real happy birthday, and I love you.
p225
aVI'll say bye for now.
p226
aa(lp227
VFW: Thank you.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VThank you.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
VJune Cohen: Frank, that was beautiful,
p236
aVso touching.
p237
aVHave you ever sent yourself a postcard?
p238
aVHave you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret?
p239
aa(lp240
VFW: I have one of my own secrets in every book.
p241
aVI think in some ways, the reason I started the project,
p242
aVeven though I didn't know it at the time,
p243
aVwas because I was struggling with my own secrets.
p244
aVAnd it was through crowd-sourcing,
p245
aVit was through the kindness that strangers were showing me,
p246
aVthat I could uncover
p247
aVparts of my past that were haunting me.
p248
aa(lp249
VJC: And has anyone ever discovered
p250
aVwhich secret was yours in the book?
p251
aVHas anyone in your life been able to tell?
p252
aa(lp253
VFW: Sometimes I share that information, yeah.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)

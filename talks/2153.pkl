VToday I want to talk to you about the mathematics of love.
p5
aVNow, I think that we can all agree
p6
aVthat mathematicians are famously excellent at finding love.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VBut it's not just because of our dashing personalities,
p11
aVsuperior conversational skills and excellent pencil cases.
p12
aVIt's also because we've actually done an awful lot of work into the maths
p13
aVof how to find the perfect partner.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, in my favorite paper on the subject, which is entitled,
p16
aV"Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend" \u2014
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VPeter Backus tries to rate his chances of finding love.
p21
aVNow, Peter's not a very greedy man.
p22
aVOf all of the available women in the UK,
p23
aVall Peter's looking for is somebody who lives near him,
p24
aVsomebody in the right age range,
p25
aVsomebody with a university degree,
p26
aVsomebody he's likely to get on well with,
p27
aVsomebody who's likely to be attractive,
p28
aVsomebody who's likely to find him attractive.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd comes up with an estimate of 26 women in the whole of the UK.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VIt's not looking very good, is it Peter?
p37
aVNow, just to put that into perspective,
p38
aVthat's about 400 times fewer than the best estimates
p39
aVof how many intelligent extraterrestrial life forms there are.
p40
aVAnd it also gives Peter a 1 in 285,000 chance
p41
aVof bumping into any one of these special ladies
p42
aVon a given night out.
p43
aVI'd like to think that's why mathematicians
p44
aVdon't really bother going on nights out anymore.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe thing is that I personally don't subscribe
p47
aVto such a pessimistic view.
p48
aVBecause I know, just as well as all of you do,
p49
aVthat love doesn't really work like that.
p50
aVHuman emotion isn't neatly ordered and rational and easily predictable.
p51
aVBut I also know that that doesn't mean
p52
aVthat mathematics hasn't got something that it can offer us,
p53
aVbecause, love, as with most of life, is full of patterns
p54
aVand mathematics is, ultimately, all about the study of patterns.
p55
aVPatterns from predicting the weather to the fluctuations in the stock market,
p56
aVto the movement of the planets or the growth of cities.
p57
aVAnd if we're being honest, none of those things
p58
aVare exactly neatly ordered and easily predictable, either.
p59
aVBecause I believe that mathematics is so powerful that it has the potential
p60
aVto offer us a new way of looking at almost anything.
p61
aVEven something as mysterious as love.
p62
aVAnd so, to try to persuade you
p63
aVof how totally amazing, excellent and relevant mathematics is,
p64
aVI want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VOK, so Top Tip #1:
p69
aVHow to win at online dating.
p70
aVSo my favorite online dating website is OkCupid,
p71
aVnot least because it was started by a group of mathematicians.
p72
aVNow, because they're mathematicians,
p73
aVthey have been collecting data
p74
aVon everybody who uses their site for almost a decade.
p75
aVAnd they've been trying to search for patterns
p76
aVin the way that we talk about ourselves
p77
aVand the way that we interact with each other
p78
aVon an online dating website.
p79
aVAnd they've come up with some seriously interesting findings.
p80
aVBut my particular favorite
p81
aVis that it turns out that on an online dating website,
p82
aVhow attractive you are does not dictate how popular you are,
p83
aVand actually, having people think that you're ugly
p84
aVcan work to your advantage.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VLet me show you how this works.
p89
aVIn a thankfully voluntary section of OkCupid,
p90
aVyou are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are
p91
aVon a scale between one and five.
p92
aVNow, if we compare this score, the average score,
p93
aVto how many messages a selection of people receive,
p94
aVyou can begin to get a sense
p95
aVof how attractiveness links to popularity on an online dating website.
p96
aa(lp97
VThis is the graph the OkCupid guys have come up with.
p98
aVAnd the important thing to notice is that it's not totally true
p99
aVthat the more attractive you are, the more messages you get.
p100
aVBut the question arises then of what is it about people up here
p101
aVwho are so much more popular than people down here,
p102
aVeven though they have the same score of attractiveness?
p103
aVAnd the reason why is that it's not just straightforward looks that are important.
p104
aVSo let me try to illustrate their findings with an example.
p105
aVSo if you take someone like Portia de Rossi, for example,
p106
aVeverybody agrees that Portia de Rossi is a very beautiful woman.
p107
aVNobody thinks that she's ugly, but she's not a supermodel, either.
p108
aVIf you compare Portia de Rossi to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker,
p109
aVnow, a lot of people, myself included, I should say,
p110
aVthink that Sarah Jessica Parker is seriously fabulous
p111
aVand possibly one of the most beautiful creatures
p112
aVto have ever have walked on the face of the Earth.
p113
aVBut some other people, i.e., most of the Internet ...
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
Vseem to think that she looks a bit like a horse.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, I think that if you ask people how attractive they thought
p122
aVJessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were,
p123
aVand you ask them to give them a score between one and five
p124
aVI reckon that they'd average out to have roughly the same score.
p125
aVBut the way that people would vote would be very different.
p126
aVSo Portia's scores would all be clustered around the four
p127
aVbecause everybody agrees that she's very beautiful,
p128
aVwhereas Sarah Jessica Parker completely divides opinion.
p129
aVThere'd be a huge spread in her scores.
p130
aVAnd actually it's this spread that counts.
p131
aVIt's this spread that makes you more popular
p132
aVon an online Internet dating website.
p133
aVSo what that means then
p134
aVis that if some people think that you're attractive,
p135
aVyou're actually better off
p136
aVhaving some other people think that you're a massive minger.
p137
aVThat's much better than everybody just thinking
p138
aVthat you're the cute girl next door.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow, I think this begins to make a bit more sense
p141
aVwhen you think in terms of the people who are sending these messages.
p142
aVSo let's say that you think somebody's attractive,
p143
aVbut you suspect that other people won't necessarily be that interested.
p144
aVThat means there's less competition for you
p145
aVand it's an extra incentive for you to get in touch.
p146
aVWhereas compare that to if you think somebody is attractive
p147
aVbut you suspect that everybody is going to think they're attractive.
p148
aVWell, why would you bother humiliating yourself, let's be honest?
p149
aVBut here's where the really interesting part comes.
p150
aVBecause when people choose the pictures that they use on an online dating website,
p151
aVthey often try to minimize the things
p152
aVthat they think some people will find unattractive.
p153
aVThe classic example is people who are, perhaps, a little bit overweight
p154
aVdeliberately choosing a very cropped photo,
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
Vor bald men, for example,
p159
aVdeliberately choosing pictures where they're wearing hats.
p160
aVBut actually this is the opposite of what you should do
p161
aVif you want to be successful.
p162
aVYou should really, instead,
p163
aVplay up to whatever it is that makes you different,
p164
aVeven if you think that some people will find it unattractive.
p165
aVBecause the people who fancy you are just going to fancy you anyway,
p166
aVand the unimportant losers who don't, well, they only play up to your advantage.
p167
aa(lp168
VOK, Top Tip #2: How to pick the perfect partner.
p169
aVSo let's imagine then that you're a roaring success
p170
aVon the dating scene.
p171
aVBut the question arises of how do you then convert that success
p172
aVinto longer-term happiness,
p173
aVand in particular, how do you decide when is the right time to settle down?
p174
aVNow generally, it's not advisable to just cash in
p175
aVand marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all.
p176
aVBut, equally, you don't really want to leave it too long
p177
aVif you want to maximize your chance of long-term happiness.
p178
aVAs my favorite author, Jane Austen, puts it,
p179
aV"An unmarried woman of seven and twenty
p180
aVcan never hope to feel or inspire affection again."
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VThanks a lot, Jane.
p185
aVWhat do you know about love?
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VSo the question is then,
p190
aVhow do you know when is the right time to settle down,
p191
aVgiven all the people that you can date in your lifetime?
p192
aVThankfully, there's a rather delicious bit of mathematics that we can use
p193
aVto help us out here, called optimal stopping theory.
p194
aVSo let's imagine, then,
p195
aVthat you start dating when you're 15
p196
aVand ideally, you'd like to be married by the time that you're 35.
p197
aVAnd there's a number of people
p198
aVthat you could potentially date across your lifetime,
p199
aVand they'll be at varying levels of goodness.
p200
aVNow the rules are that once you cash in and get married,
p201
aVyou can't look ahead to see what you could have had,
p202
aVand equally, you can't go back and change your mind.
p203
aVIn my experience at least,
p204
aVI find that typically people don't much like being recalled
p205
aVyears after being passed up for somebody else, or that's just me.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo the math says then that what you should do
p208
aVin the first 37 percent of your dating window,
p209
aVyou should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd then, you should pick the next person that comes along
p214
aVthat is better than everybody that you've seen before.
p215
aVSo here's the example.
p216
aVNow if you do this, it can be mathematically proven, in fact,
p217
aVthat this is the best possible way
p218
aVof maximizing your chances of finding the perfect partner.
p219
aVNow unfortunately, I have to tell you that this method does come with some risks.
p220
aVFor instance, imagine if your perfect partner appeared
p221
aVduring your first 37 percent.
p222
aVNow, unfortunately, you'd have to reject them.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VNow, if you're following the maths,
p227
aVI'm afraid no one else comes along
p228
aVthat's better than anyone you've seen before,
p229
aVso you have to go on rejecting everyone and die alone.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VProbably surrounded by cats ...
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
Vnibbling at your remains.
p238
aa(lp239
VOK, another risk is, let's imagine, instead,
p240
aVthat the first people that you dated in your first 37 percent
p241
aVare just incredibly dull, boring, terrible people.
p242
aVThat's OK, because you're in your rejection phase,
p243
aVso that's fine, you can reject them.
p244
aVBut then imagine the next person to come along
p245
aVis just marginally less boring, dull and terrible ...
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
Vthan everybody that you've seen before.
p250
aVNow, if you are following the maths, I'm afraid you have to marry them ...
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
Vand end up in a relationship which is, frankly, suboptimal.
p255
aVSorry about that.
p256
aVBut I do think that there's an opportunity here for Hallmark to cash in on
p257
aVand really cater for this market.
p258
aVA Valentine's Day card like this.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
V"My darling husband, you are marginally less terrible
p263
aVthan the first 37 percent of people I dated."
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VIt's actually more romantic than I normally manage.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VOK, so this method doesn't give you a 100 percent success rate,
p272
aVbut there's no other possible strategy that can do any better.
p273
aVAnd actually, in the wild, there are certain types of fish
p274
aVwhich follow and employ this exact strategy.
p275
aVSo they reject every possible suitor that turns up
p276
aVin the first 37 percent of the mating season,
p277
aVand then they pick the next fish that comes along after that window
p278
aVthat's, I don't know, bigger and burlier
p279
aVthan all of the fish that they've seen before.
p280
aVI also think that subconsciously, humans, we do sort of do this anyway.
p281
aVWe give ourselves a little bit of time to play the field,
p282
aVget a feel for the marketplace or whatever when we're young.
p283
aVAnd then we only start looking seriously at potential marriage candidates
p284
aVonce we hit our mid-to-late 20s.
p285
aVI think this is conclusive proof, if ever it were needed,
p286
aVthat everybody's brains are prewired to be just a little bit mathematical.
p287
aa(lp288
VOK, so that was Top Tip #2.
p289
aVNow, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce.
p290
aVOK, so let's imagine then that you picked your perfect partner
p291
aVand you're settling into a lifelong relationship with them.
p292
aVNow, I like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce,
p293
aVapart from, I don't know, Piers Morgan's wife, maybe?
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VBut it's a sad fact of modern life
p298
aVthat one in two marriages in the States ends in divorce,
p299
aVwith the rest of the world not being far behind.
p300
aVNow, you can be forgiven, perhaps
p301
aVfor thinking that the arguments that precede a marital breakup
p302
aVare not an ideal candidate for mathematical investigation.
p303
aVFor one thing, it's very hard to know
p304
aVwhat you should be measuring or what you should be quantifying.
p305
aVBut this didn't stop a psychologist, John Gottman, who did exactly that.
p306
aVGottman observed hundreds of couples having a conversation
p307
aVand recorded, well, everything you can think of.
p308
aVSo he recorded what was said in the conversation,
p309
aVhe recorded their skin conductivity,
p310
aVhe recorded their facial expressions,
p311
aVtheir heart rates, their blood pressure,
p312
aVbasically everything apart from whether or not the wife was actually always right,
p313
aVwhich incidentally she totally is.
p314
aVBut what Gottman and his team found
p315
aVwas that one of the most important predictors
p316
aVfor whether or not a couple is going to get divorced
p317
aVwas how positive or negative each partner was being in the conversation.
p318
aa(lp319
VNow, couples that were very low-risk
p320
aVscored a lot more positive points on Gottman's scale than negative.
p321
aVWhereas bad relationships,
p322
aVby which I mean, probably going to get divorced,
p323
aVthey found themselves getting into a spiral of negativity.
p324
aVNow just by using these very simple ideas,
p325
aVGottman and his group were able to predict
p326
aVwhether a given couple was going to get divorced
p327
aVwith a 90 percent accuracy.
p328
aVBut it wasn't until he teamed up with a mathematician, James Murray,
p329
aVthat they really started to understand
p330
aVwhat causes these negativity spirals and how they occur.
p331
aVAnd the results that they found,
p332
aVI think, are just incredibly impressively simple and interesting.
p333
aVSo these equations predict how the wife or husband is going to respond
p334
aVin their next turn of the conversation,
p335
aVhow positive or negative they're going to be.
p336
aVAnd these equations depend on
p337
aVthe mood of the person when they're on their own,
p338
aVthe mood of the person when they're with their partner,
p339
aVbut most importantly, they depend on
p340
aVhow much the husband and wife influence one another.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, I think it's important to point out at this stage,
p343
aVthat these exact equations have also been shown
p344
aVto be perfectly able at describing
p345
aVwhat happens between two countries in an arms race.
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VSo that an arguing couple spiraling into negativity
p350
aVand teetering on the brink of divorce
p351
aVis actually mathematically equivalent to the beginning of a nuclear war.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VBut the really important term in this equation
p356
aVis the influence that people have on one another,
p357
aVand in particular, something called "the negativity threshold."
p358
aVNow, the negativity threshold,
p359
aVyou can think of as how annoying the husband can be
p360
aVbefore the wife starts to get really pissed off, and vice versa.
p361
aVNow, I always thought that good marriages were about compromise and understanding
p362
aVand allowing the person to have the space to be themselves.
p363
aVSo I would have thought that perhaps the most successful relationships
p364
aVwere ones where there was a really high negativity threshold.
p365
aVWhere couples let things go
p366
aVand only brought things up if they really were a big deal.
p367
aVBut actually, the mathematics and subsequent findings by the team
p368
aVhave shown the exact opposite is true.
p369
aVThe best couples, or the most successful couples,
p370
aVare the ones with a really low negativity threshold.
p371
aVThese are the couples that don't let anything go unnoticed
p372
aVand allow each other some room to complain.
p373
aVThese are the couples that are continually trying to repair their own relationship,
p374
aVthat have a much more positive outlook on their marriage.
p375
aVCouples that don't let things go
p376
aVand couples that don't let trivial things end up being a really big deal.
p377
aa(lp378
VNow of course, it takes a bit more than just a low negativity threshold
p379
aVand not compromising to have a successful relationship.
p380
aVBut I think that it's quite interesting
p381
aVto know that there is really mathematical evidence
p382
aVto say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo those are my top three tips
p385
aVof how maths can help you with love and relationships.
p386
aVBut I hope, that aside from their use as tips,
p387
aVthey also give you a little bit of insight into the power of mathematics.
p388
aVBecause for me, equations and symbols aren't just a thing.
p389
aVThey're a voice that speaks out about the incredible richness of nature
p390
aVand the startling simplicity
p391
aVin the patterns that twist and turn and warp and evolve all around us,
p392
aVfrom how the world works to how we behave.
p393
aVSo I hope that perhaps, for just a couple of you,
p394
aVa little bit of insight into the mathematics of love
p395
aVcan persuade you to have a little bit more love for mathematics.
p396
aa(lp397
VThank you.

VHow often do we hear that people just don't care?
p5
aVHow many times have you been told
p6
aVthat real, substantial change isn't possible
p7
aVbecause most people are too selfish,
p8
aVtoo stupid or too lazy
p9
aVto try to make a difference in their community?
p10
aVI propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it
p11
aVdoesn't actually exist;
p12
aVbut rather, that people do care,
p13
aVbut that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement
p14
aVby constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way.
p15
aa(lp16
VI'll give you some examples of what I mean.
p17
aVLet's start with city hall.
p18
aVYou ever see one of these before?
p19
aVThis is a newspaper ad.
p20
aVIt's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building
p21
aVso the neighborhood knows what's happening.
p22
aVAs you can see, it's impossible to read.
p23
aVYou need to get halfway down
p24
aVto even find out which address they're talking about,
p25
aVand then further down, in tiny 10-point font,
p26
aVto find out how to actually get involved.
p27
aVImagine if the private sector advertised in the same way \u2014
p28
aVif Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes \u2014
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd put an ad in the paper like that.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Applause)
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, that would never happen.
p37
aVYou'll never see an ad like that,
p38
aVbecause Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes,
p39
aVwhereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved
p40
aVwith the planning process,
p41
aVotherwise their ads would look something like this,
p42
aVwith all the information laid out clearly.
p43
aVAs long as the city's putting out notices like this
p44
aVto try to get people engaged,
p45
aVthen of course people aren't going to be engaged.
p46
aVBut that's not apathy; that's intentional exclusion.
p47
aa(lp48
VPublic space.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Applause)
p51
aa(lp52
VThe manner in which we mistreat our public spaces
p53
aVis a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change,
p54
aVbecause we've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression.
p55
aVWhoever has the most money gets the loudest voice,
p56
aVdominating the visual and mental environment.
p57
aVThe problem with this model is there are some amazing messages
p58
aVthat need to be said, that aren't profitable to say.
p59
aVSo you're never going to see them on a billboard.
p60
aa(lp61
VThe media plays an important role
p62
aVin developing our relationship with political change,
p63
aVmainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals,
p64
aVbut even when they do talk about important political issues,
p65
aVthey do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement.
p66
aVI'll give you an example.
p67
aVThe "Now" magazine from last week: progressive, downtown weekly in Toronto.
p68
aVThis is the cover story.
p69
aVIt's an article about a theater performance,
p70
aVand it starts with basic information about where it is,
p71
aVin case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article \u2014
p72
aVwhere, the time, the website.
p73
aVSame with this \u2014 it's a movie review.
p74
aVAn art review.
p75
aVA book review \u2014 where the reading is in case you want to go.
p76
aVA restaurant \u2014 you might not want to just read about it,
p77
aVmaybe you want to go there.
p78
aVSo they tell you where it is, the prices, the address, the phone number, etc.
p79
aa(lp80
VThen you get to their political articles.
p81
aVHere's a great article about an important election race that's happening.
p82
aVIt talks about the candidates, written very well,
p83
aVbut no information, no follow-up, no websites for the campaigns,
p84
aVno information about when the debates are, where the campaign offices are.
p85
aVHere's another good article,
p86
aVabout a new campaign opposing privatization of transit,
p87
aVwithout any contact information for the campaign.
p88
aVThe message seems to be
p89
aVthat the readers are most likely to want to eat, maybe read a book,
p90
aVmaybe see a movie, but not be engaged in their community.
p91
aVYou might think this is a small thing, but I think it's important,
p92
aVbecause it sets a tone
p93
aVand it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport.
p94
aa(lp95
VHeroes: How do we view leadership?
p96
aVLook at these 10 movies. What do they have in common?
p97
aVAnyone?
p98
aVThey all have heroes who were chosen.
p99
aVSomeone came up to them and said, "You're the chosen one.
p100
aVThere's a prophecy. You have to save the world."
p101
aVAnd then they go off and save the world because they've been told to,
p102
aVwith a few people tagging along.
p103
aVThis helps me understand
p104
aVwhy a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders \u2014
p105
aVbecause it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about.
p106
aVA heroic effort is a collective effort,
p107
aVnumber one.
p108
aVNumber two, it's imperfect; it's not very glamorous,
p109
aVand doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end.
p110
aVIt's an ongoing process your whole life.
p111
aVBut most importantly, it's voluntary.
p112
aVIt's voluntary.
p113
aVAs long as we're teaching our kids
p114
aVthat heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead,
p115
aVor someone tells you you're part of a prophecy,
p116
aVthey're missing the most important characteristic of leadership,
p117
aVwhich is that it comes from within.
p118
aVIt's about following your own dreams, uninvited,
p119
aVand then working with others to make those dreams come true.
p120
aa(lp121
VPolitical parties: oh, boy.
p122
aVPolitical parties could and should be one of the basic entry points
p123
aVfor people to get engaged in politics.
p124
aVInstead, they've become, sadly,
p125
aVuninspiring and uncreative organizations
p126
aVthat rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups
p127
aVthat they end up all saying the same thing,
p128
aVpretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear
p129
aVat the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas.
p130
aVAnd people can smell that, and it feeds cynicism.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
VCharitable status.
p135
aVGroups who have charitable status in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy.
p136
aVThis is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change,
p137
aVbecause it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices
p138
aVare completely silenced, especially during election time.
p139
aVWhich leads us to the last one, which is: our elections.
p140
aa(lp141
VAs you may have noticed,
p142
aVour elections in Canada are a complete joke.
p143
aVWe use out-of-date systems
p144
aVthat are unfair and create random results.
p145
aVCanada's currently led by a party
p146
aVthat most Canadians didn't actually want.
p147
aVHow can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote
p148
aVwhen votes don't count in Canada?
p149
aVYou add all this up together, and of course people are apathetic.
p150
aVIt's like trying to run into a brick wall.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, I'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out
p153
aVand explaining what's in our way.
p154
aVQuite the opposite \u2014
p155
aVI actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care,
p156
aVbut that, as I said, we live in this environment
p157
aVwhere all these obstacles are being put in our way.
p158
aVAs long as we believe that people, our own neighbors,
p159
aVare selfish, stupid or lazy,
p160
aVthen there's no hope.
p161
aVBut we can change all those things I mentioned.
p162
aVWe can open up city hall.
p163
aVWe can reform our electoral systems.
p164
aVWe can democratize our public spaces.
p165
aa(lp166
VMy main message is:
p167
aVif we can redefine apathy,
p168
aVnot as some kind of internal syndrome,
p169
aVbut as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement,
p170
aVand if we can clearly define, clearly identify what those obstacles are,
p171
aVand then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles,
p172
aVthen anything is possible.
p173
aa(lp174
VThank you.

VI'm talking to you about
p5
aVthe worst form of human rights violation,
p6
aVthe third-largest organized crime,
p7
aVa $10 billion industry.
p8
aVI'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'd like to tell you the story
p11
aVof these three children,
p12
aVPranitha, Shaheen and Anjali.
p13
aVPranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution,
p14
aVa prostituted person.
p15
aVShe got infected with HIV,
p16
aVand towards the end of her life,
p17
aVwhen she was in the final stages of AIDS,
p18
aVshe could not prostitute,
p19
aVso she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker.
p20
aVBy the time we got the information, we reached there,
p21
aVPranitha was already raped by three men.
p22
aa(lp23
VShaheen's background I don't even know.
p24
aVWe found her in a railway track,
p25
aVraped by many, many men, I don't know many.
p26
aVBut the indications of that on her body was
p27
aVthat her intestine was outside her body.
p28
aVAnd when we took her to the hospital
p29
aVshe needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.
p30
aVWe still don't know who her parents are, who she is.
p31
aVAll that we know that hundreds of men
p32
aVhad used her brutally.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnjali's father, a drunkard,
p35
aVsold his child for pornography.
p36
aVYou're seeing here images of
p37
aVthree years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children
p38
aVwho have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.
p39
aVIn this country, and across the globe,
p40
aVhundreds and thousands of children,
p41
aVas young as three, as young as four,
p42
aVare sold into sexual slavery.
p43
aVBut that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.
p44
aVThey are sold in the name of adoption.
p45
aVThey are sold in the name of organ trade.
p46
aVThey are sold in the name of forced labor,
p47
aVcamel jockeying, anything, everything.
p48
aa(lp49
VI work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.
p50
aVAnd I tell you stories from there.
p51
aVMy own journey to work with these children
p52
aVstarted as a teenager.
p53
aVI was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.
p54
aVI don't remember the rape part of it so much
p55
aVas much as the anger part of it.
p56
aVYes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me,
p57
aVbut that didn't go into my consciousness.
p58
aVI never felt like a victim, then or now.
p59
aVBut what lingered from then till now \u2014 I am 40 today \u2014
p60
aVis this huge outrageous anger.
p61
aa(lp62
VTwo years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated,
p63
aVbecause I was a victim.
p64
aVAnd that's what we do to all traffic survivors.
p65
aVWe, as a society, we have PhDs
p66
aVin victimizing a victim.
p67
aVRight from the age of 15,
p68
aVwhen I started looking around me,
p69
aVI started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children
p70
aVwho are left in sexual slavery-like practices,
p71
aVbut have absolutely no respite,
p72
aVbecause we don't allow them to come in.
p73
aa(lp74
VWhere does their journey begin?
p75
aVMost of them come from very optionless families,
p76
aVnot just poor.
p77
aVYou have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.
p78
aVI had this I.S. officer's daughter,
p79
aVwho is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard,
p80
aVwho was raped chatting with one individual,
p81
aVand ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine,
p82
aVwho was trafficked.
p83
aVI have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families,
p84
aVand children from well-to-do families,
p85
aVwho are getting trafficked.
p86
aa(lp87
VThese people are deceived, forced.
p88
aV99.9 percent of them
p89
aVresist being inducted into prostitution.
p90
aVSome pay the price for it.
p91
aVThey're killed; we don't even hear about them.
p92
aVThey are voiceless, [unclear],
p93
aVnameless people.
p94
aVBut the rest, who succumb into it,
p95
aVgo through everyday torture.
p96
aVBecause the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends,
p97
aVor who want to have a family with you.
p98
aVThese are men who buy you for an hour, for a day,
p99
aVand use you, throw you.
p100
aa(lp101
VEach of the girls that I have rescued \u2014
p102
aVI have rescued more than 3,200 girls \u2014
p103
aVeach of them tell me one story in common ...
p104
aV(Applause)
p105
aVone story about one man, at least,
p106
aVputting chili powder in her vagina,
p107
aVone man taking a cigarette and burning her,
p108
aVone man whipping her.
p109
aVWe are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers,
p110
aVuncles, cousins, all around us.
p111
aVAnd we are silent about them.
p112
aa(lp113
VWe think it is easy money.
p114
aVWe think it is shortcut.
p115
aVWe think the person likes to do what she's doing.
p116
aVBut the extra bonuses that she gets
p117
aVis various infections, sexually transmitted infections,
p118
aVHIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,
p119
aVsubstance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.
p120
aVAnd one day she gives up on you and me,
p121
aVbecause we have no options for her.
p122
aVAnd therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.
p123
aVShe believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about."
p124
aVAnd this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.
p125
aVAnd it's abnormal to live in a shelter.
p126
aVIt's abnormal to get rehabilitated.
p127
aa(lp128
VIt's in that context that I work.
p129
aVIt's in that context that I rescue children.
p130
aVI've rescued children as young as three years,
p131
aVand I've rescued women as old as 40 years.
p132
aVWhen I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had
p133
aVwas where do I begin.
p134
aVBecause I had lots of them
p135
aVwho were already HIV infected.
p136
aVOne third of the people I rescue
p137
aVare HIV positive.
p138
aVAnd therefore my challenge was to
p139
aVunderstand how can I get out
p140
aVthe power from this pain.
p141
aVAnd for me, I was my greatest experience.
p142
aVUnderstanding my own self,
p143
aVunderstanding my own pain,
p144
aVmy own isolation,
p145
aVwas my greatest teacher.
p146
aVBecause what we did with these girls
p147
aVis to understand their potential.
p148
aa(lp149
VYou see a girl here who is trained as a welder.
p150
aVShe works for a very big company,
p151
aVa workshop in Hyderabad,
p152
aVmaking furnitures.
p153
aVShe earns around 12,000 rupees.
p154
aVShe is an illiterate girl,
p155
aVtrained, skilled as a welder.
p156
aVWhy welding and why not computers?
p157
aVWe felt, one of the things that these girls had
p158
aVis immense amount of courage.
p159
aVThey did not have any pardas inside their body,
p160
aVhijabs inside themselves;
p161
aVthey've crossed the barrier of it.
p162
aVAnd therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world,
p163
aVvery easily, and not feel very shy about it.
p164
aa(lp165
VWe have trained girls as carpenters,
p166
aVas masons,
p167
aVas security guards, as cab drivers.
p168
aVAnd each one of them are excelling
p169
aVin their chosen field,
p170
aVgaining confidence, restoring dignity,
p171
aVand building hopes in their own lives.
p172
aVThese girls are also working in big construction companies
p173
aVlike Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.
p174
aa(lp175
VWhat has been my challenge?
p176
aVMy challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.
p177
aVI've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.
p178
aVI can't hear from my right ear.
p179
aVI've lost a staff of mine who was murdered
p180
aVwhile on a rescue.
p181
aVMy biggest challenge
p182
aVis society.
p183
aVIt's you and me.
p184
aVMy biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims
p185
aVas our own.
p186
aa(lp187
VA very supportive friend of mine,
p188
aVa well-wisher of mine,
p189
aVused to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.
p190
aVWhen her mother fell sick she said,
p191
aV"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.
p192
aVCan you get somebody in my house to work,
p193
aVso that she can look after my mother?"
p194
aVAnd there is a long pause.
p195
aVAnd then she says, "Not one of our girls."
p196
aa(lp197
VIt's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking,
p198
aVin this fantastic A-C hall.
p199
aVIt's very nice for discussion, discourse,
p200
aVmaking films and everything.
p201
aVBut it is not nice to bring them to our homes.
p202
aVIt's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.
p203
aVIt's not nice for our children to study with their children.
p204
aVThere it ends.
p205
aVThat's my biggest challenge.
p206
aa(lp207
VIf I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.
p208
aVI'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.
p209
aVThey need your compassion.
p210
aVThey need your empathy.
p211
aVThey need, much more than anything else,
p212
aVyour acceptance.
p213
aa(lp214
VMany times when I talk to people,
p215
aVI keep telling them one thing:
p216
aVdon't tell me hundred ways
p217
aVhow you cannot respond to this problem.
p218
aVCan you ply your mind for that one way
p219
aVthat you can respond to the problem?
p220
aVAnd that's what I'm here for,
p221
aVasking for your support,
p222
aVdemanding for your support,
p223
aVrequesting for your support.
p224
aVCan you break your culture of silence?
p225
aVCan you speak to at least two persons about this story?
p226
aVTell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.
p227
aa(lp228
VI'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis
p229
aVor Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars,
p230
aVor something like that.
p231
aVI'm asking you, in your limited world,
p232
aVcan you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?
p233
aVCan you just encompass these people too?
p234
aVBecause they are also a part of us.
p235
aVThey are also part of this world.
p236
aVI'm asking you, for these children,
p237
aVwhose faces you see, they're no more.
p238
aVThey died of AIDS last year.
p239
aVI'm asking you to help them,
p240
aVaccept as human beings \u2014
p241
aVnot as philanthropy, not as charity,
p242
aVbut as human beings who deserve all our support.
p243
aVI'm asking you this because no child, no human being,
p244
aVdeserves what these children have gone through.
p245
aVThank you.
p246
aV(Applause)

VSo, people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVAt least, according to a 1973 "Book of Lists" survey
p7
aVwhich preceded all those online best, worst, funniest lists that you see today.
p8
aVOnly heights and public speaking
p9
aVexceeded the six-legged as sources of fear.
p10
aVAnd I suspect if you had put spiders in there,
p11
aVthe combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart.
p12
aVNow, I am not one of those people.
p13
aVI really love insects.
p14
aVI think they're interesting and beautiful,
p15
aVand sometimes even cute.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVAnd I'm not alone.
p18
aVFor centuries, some of the greatest minds in science,
p19
aVfrom Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson,
p20
aVhave drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on Earth.
p21
aVWell, why is that?
p22
aVWhat is that keeps us coming back to insects?
p23
aVSome of it, of course, is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them.
p24
aVThey're more numerous than any other kind of animal.
p25
aVWe don't even know how many species of insects there are,
p26
aVbecause new ones are being discovered all the time.
p27
aVThere are at least a million, maybe as many as 10 million.
p28
aVThis means that you could have an insect-of-the-month calendar
p29
aVand not have to reuse a species for over 80,000 years.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVTake that, pandas and kittens!
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VMore seriously, insects are essential.
p35
aVWe need them.
p36
aVIt's been estimated that 1 out of every 3 bites of food
p37
aVis made possible by a pollinator.
p38
aVScientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries
p39
aVabout everything from the structure of our nervous systems
p40
aVto how our genes and DNA work.
p41
aVBut what I love most about insects
p42
aVis what they can tell us about our own behavior.
p43
aVInsects seem like they do everything that people do.
p44
aVThey meet, they mate, they fight, they break up.
p45
aVAnd they do so with what looks like love or animosity.
p46
aVBut what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own,
p47
aVand that difference can be really illuminating.
p48
aVThere's nowhere where that's more true
p49
aVthan when it comes to one of our most consuming interests \u2014 sex.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, I will maintain. and I think I can defend,
p52
aVwhat may seem like a surprising statement.
p53
aVI think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVAnd the wild variety that we see
p56
aVmakes us challenge some of our own assumptions
p57
aVabout what it means to be male and female.
p58
aVOf course, to start with,
p59
aVa lot of insects don't need to have sex at all to reproduce.
p60
aVFemale aphids can make little, tiny clones of themselves without ever mating.
p61
aVVirgin birth, right there.
p62
aVOn your rose bushes.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVWhen they do have sex,
p65
aVeven their sperm is more interesting than human sperm.
p66
aVThere are some kinds of fruit flies
p67
aVwhose sperm is longer than the male's own body.
p68
aVAnd that's important because the males use their sperm to compete.
p69
aVNow, male insects do compete with weapons, like the horns on these beetles.
p70
aVBut they also compete after mating with their sperm.
p71
aVDragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives
p72
aVwith all of the attachments pulled out.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVThey use these formidable devices like scoops,
p75
aVto remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVSo, what can we learn from this?
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVAll right, it is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them
p80
aVor of them setting an example for us to follow.
p81
aVWhich, given this, is probably just as well.
p82
aVAnd also, did I mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects?
p83
aVSo, no, that's not the point.
p84
aVBut what I think insects do,
p85
aVis break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles.
p86
aVSo, people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version
p87
aVof what males and females are like.
p88
aVSo that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive,
p89
aVand females are passive and coy.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut that's just not the case.
p92
aVSo for example, take katydids,
p93
aVwhich are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers.
p94
aVThe males are very picky about who they mate with,
p95
aVbecause they not only transfer sperm during mating,
p96
aVthey also give the female something called a nuptial gift.
p97
aVYou can see two katydids mating in these photos.
p98
aVIn both panels, the male's the one on the right,
p99
aVand that sword-like appendage is the female's egg-laying organ.
p100
aVThe white blob is the sperm,
p101
aVthe green blob is the nuptial gift,
p102
aVand the male manufactures this from his own body
p103
aVand it's extremely costly to produce.
p104
aVIt can weigh up to a third of his body mass.
p105
aVI will now pause for a moment and let you think about
p106
aVwhat it would be like if human men, every time they had sex,
p107
aVhad to produce something that weighed 50, 60, 70 pounds.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVOkay, they would not be able to do that very often.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aVAnd indeed, neither can the katydids.
p112
aVAnd so what that means
p113
aVis the katydid males are very choosy
p114
aVabout who they offer these nuptial gifts to.
p115
aVNow, the gift is very nutritious,
p116
aVand the female eats it during and after mating.
p117
aVSo, the bigger it is, the better off the male is,
p118
aVbecause that means more time for his sperm
p119
aVto drain into her body and fertilize her eggs.
p120
aVBut it also means that the males are very passive about mating,
p121
aVwhereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive,
p122
aVin an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can.
p123
aVSo, it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules.
p124
aVEven more generally though,
p125
aVmales are actually not all that important in the lives of a lot of insects.
p126
aVIn the social insects \u2014 the bees and wasps and ants \u2014
p127
aVthe individuals that you see every day \u2014
p128
aVthe ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl,
p129
aVthe honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower \u2014
p130
aVall of those are always female.
p131
aVPeople have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia.
p132
aVThe ancient Greeks knew that there was a class of bees, the drones,
p133
aVthat are larger than the workers,
p134
aValthough they disapproved of the drones' laziness
p135
aVbecause they could see that the drones just hang around the hive
p136
aVuntil the mating flight \u2014
p137
aVthey're the males.
p138
aVThey hang around until the mating flight,
p139
aVbut they don't participate in gathering nectar or pollen.
p140
aVThe Greeks couldn't figure out the drones' sex,
p141
aVand part of the confusion was that they were aware of the stinging ability of bees
p142
aVbut they found it difficult to believe
p143
aVthat any animals that bore such a weapon could possibly be a female.
p144
aVAristotle tried to get involved as well.
p145
aVHe suggested, "OK, if the stinging individuals are going to be the males ..."
p146
aVThen he got confused, because that would have meant
p147
aVthe males were also taking care of the young in a colony,
p148
aVand he seemed to think that would be completely impossible.
p149
aVHe then concluded that maybe bees had the organs of both sexes
p150
aVin the same individual,
p151
aVwhich is not that far-fetched, some animals do that,
p152
aVbut he never really did get it figured out.
p153
aVAnd you know, even today, my students, for instance,
p154
aVcall every animal they see, including insects, a male.
p155
aVAnd when I tell them that the ferocious army-ant soldiers
p156
aVwith their giant jaws, used to defend the colony,
p157
aVare all always female,
p158
aVthey seem to not quite believe me.
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aVAnd certainly all of the movies \u2014 Antz, Bee Movie \u2014
p161
aVportray the main character in the social insects as being male.
p162
aVWell, what difference does this make?
p163
aVThese are movies. They're fiction.
p164
aVThey have talking animals in them.
p165
aVWhat difference does it make if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld?
p166
aVI think it does matter,
p167
aVand it's a problem that actually is part of a much deeper one
p168
aVthat has implications for medicine and health
p169
aVand a lot of other aspects of our lives.
p170
aVYou all know that scientists use what we call model systems,
p171
aVwhich are creatures \u2014 white rats or fruit flies \u2014
p172
aVthat are kind of stand-ins for all other animals, including people.
p173
aVAnd the idea is that what's true for a person
p174
aVwill also be true for the white rat.
p175
aVAnd by and large, that turns out to be the case.
p176
aVBut you can take the idea of a model system too far.
p177
aVAnd what I think we've done,
p178
aVis use males, in any species, as though they are the model system.
p179
aVThe norm.
p180
aVThe way things are supposed to be.
p181
aVAnd females as a kind of variant \u2014
p182
aVsomething special that you only study after you get the basics down.
p183
aVAnd so, back to the insects.
p184
aVI think what that means
p185
aVis that people just couldn't see what was in front of them.
p186
aVBecause they assumed that the world's stage was largely occupied by male players
p187
aVand females would only have minor, walk-on roles.
p188
aVBut when we do that, we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like.
p189
aVAnd we can also miss out on the way natural, living things, including people,
p190
aVcan vary.
p191
aVAnd I think that's why we've used males as models in a lot of medical research,
p192
aVsomething that we know now to be a problem
p193
aVif we want the results to apply to both men and women.
p194
aVWell, the last thing I really love about insects
p195
aVis something that a lot of people find unnerving about them.
p196
aVThey have little, tiny brains
p197
aVwith very little cognitive ability, the way we normally think of it.
p198
aVThey have complicated behavior, but they lack complicated brains.
p199
aVAnd so, we can't just think of them as though they're little people
p200
aVbecause they don't do things the way that we do.
p201
aVI really love that it's difficult to anthropomorphize insects,
p202
aVto look at them and just think of them like they're little people
p203
aVin exoskeletons, with six legs.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVInstead, you really have to accept them on their own terms,
p206
aVbecause insects make us question what's normal and what's natural.
p207
aVNow, you know, people write fiction and talk about parallel universes.
p208
aVThey speculate about the supernatural,
p209
aVmaybe the spirits of the departed walking among us.
p210
aVThe allure of another world
p211
aVis something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal.
p212
aVBut as far as I'm concerned,
p213
aVwho needs to be able to see dead people,
p214
aVwhen you can see live insects?
p215
aVThank you.
p216
aV(Applause)

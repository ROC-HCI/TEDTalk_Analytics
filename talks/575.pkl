VI want to talk about the transformed media landscape,
p5
aVand what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out
p6
aVto anywhere in the world.
p7
aVAnd I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories
p8
aVabout that transformation.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election.
p11
aVYou probably read something about it in the papers.
p12
aVAnd there was some concern that in some parts of the country
p13
aVthere might be voter suppression.
p14
aVAnd so a plan came up to video the vote.
p15
aVAnd the idea was that individual citizens
p16
aVwith phones capable of taking photos or making video
p17
aVwould document their polling places,
p18
aVon the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques,
p19
aVand would upload this to a central place.
p20
aVAnd that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation \u2014
p21
aVthat citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes,
p22
aVbut also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together.
p25
aVWhat matters here
p26
aVisn't technical capital,
p27
aVit's social capital.
p28
aVThese tools don't get socially interesting
p29
aVuntil they get technologically boring.
p30
aVIt isn't when the shiny new tools show up
p31
aVthat their uses start permeating society.
p32
aVIt's when everybody is able to take them for granted.
p33
aVBecause now that media is increasingly social,
p34
aVinnovation can happen anywhere
p35
aVthat people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd so we're starting to see a media landscape
p38
aVin which innovation is happening everywhere,
p39
aVand moving from one spot to another.
p40
aVThat is a huge transformation.
p41
aVNot to put too fine a point on it, the moment we're living through \u2014
p42
aVthe moment our historical generation is living through \u2014
p43
aVis the largest increase in expressive capability
p44
aVin human history.
p45
aVNow that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up.
p46
aa(lp47
VThere are only four periods in the last 500 years
p48
aVwhere media has changed enough to qualify for the label "revolution."
p49
aVThe first one is the famous one, the printing press:
p50
aVmovable type, oil-based inks, that whole complex of innovations
p51
aVthat made printing possible
p52
aVand turned Europe upside-down, starting in the middle of the 1400s.
p53
aVThen, a couple of hundred years ago,
p54
aVthere was innovation in two-way communication,
p55
aVconversational media: first the telegraph, then the telephone.
p56
aVSlow, text-based conversations,
p57
aVthen real-time voice based conversations.
p58
aVThen, about 150 years ago,
p59
aVthere was a revolution in recorded media other than print:
p60
aVfirst photos, then recorded sound,
p61
aVthen movies, all encoded onto physical objects.
p62
aVAnd finally, about 100 years ago, the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum
p63
aVto send sound and images through the air \u2014 radio and television.
p64
aVThis is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century.
p65
aVThis is what those of us of a certain age
p66
aVgrew up with, and are used to.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut there is a curious asymmetry here.
p69
aVThe media that is good at creating conversations
p70
aVis no good at creating groups.
p71
aVAnd the media that's good at creating groups
p72
aVis no good at creating conversations.
p73
aVIf you want to have a conversation
p74
aVin this world, you have it with one other person.
p75
aVIf you want to address a group, you get the same message
p76
aVand you give it to everybody in the group,
p77
aVwhether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press.
p78
aVThat was the media landscape
p79
aVas we had it in the twentieth century.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd this is what changed.
p82
aVThis thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen
p83
aVis Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet.
p84
aVHe traces the edges of the individual networks
p85
aVand then color codes them.
p86
aVThe Internet is the first medium in history
p87
aVthat has native support for groups
p88
aVand conversation at the same time.
p89
aVWhereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern,
p90
aVand television, radio, magazines, books,
p91
aVgave us the one-to-many pattern,
p92
aVthe Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.
p93
aVFor the first time,
p94
aVmedia is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations.
p95
aVThat's one of the big changes.
p96
aa(lp97
VThe second big change
p98
aVis that, as all media gets digitized,
p99
aVthe Internet also becomes the mode of carriage
p100
aVfor all other media,
p101
aVmeaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet,
p102
aVmagazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet.
p103
aVAnd that means that every medium
p104
aVis right next door to every other medium.
p105
aVPut another way,
p106
aVmedia is increasingly less just a source of information,
p107
aVand it is increasingly more a site of coordination,
p108
aVbecause groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something
p109
aVcan now gather around and talk to each other as well.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd the third big change
p112
aVis that members of the former audience, as Dan Gilmore calls them,
p113
aVcan now also be producers and not consumers.
p114
aVEvery time a new consumer
p115
aVjoins this media landscape
p116
aVa new producer joins as well,
p117
aVbecause the same equipment \u2014
p118
aVphones, computers \u2014
p119
aVlet you consume and produce.
p120
aVIt's as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free;
p121
aVit's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio
p122
aVif you pressed the right buttons.
p123
aVThat is a huge change
p124
aVin the media landscape we're used to.
p125
aVAnd it's not just Internet or no Internet.
p126
aVWe've had the Internet in its public form
p127
aVfor almost 20 years now,
p128
aVand it's still changing
p129
aVas the media becomes more social.
p130
aVIt's still changing patterns
p131
aVeven among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well.
p132
aa(lp133
VSecond story.
p134
aVLast May, China in the Sichuan province
p135
aVhad a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude,
p136
aVmassive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.
p137
aVAnd the earthquake was reported as it was happening.
p138
aVPeople were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings.
p139
aVThey were taking videos of buildings shaking.
p140
aVThey were uploading it to QQ, China's largest Internet service.
p141
aVThey were Twittering it.
p142
aVAnd so as the quake was happening
p143
aVthe news was reported.
p144
aVAnd because of the social connections,
p145
aVChinese students coming elsewhere, and going to school,
p146
aVor businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China \u2014
p147
aVthere were people listening all over the world, hearing this news.
p148
aVThe BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter.
p149
aVTwitter announced the existence of the quake
p150
aVseveral minutes before the US Geological Survey
p151
aVhad anything up online for anybody to read.
p152
aVThe last time China had a quake of that magnitude
p153
aVit took them three months to admit that it had happened.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VNow they might have liked to have done that here,
p158
aVrather than seeing these pictures go up online.
p159
aVBut they weren't given that choice,
p160
aVbecause their own citizens beat them to the punch.
p161
aVEven the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens,
p162
aVrather than from the Xinhua News Agency.
p163
aVAnd this stuff rippled like wildfire.
p164
aVFor a while there
p165
aVthe top 10 most clicked links on Twitter,
p166
aVthe global short messaging service \u2014
p167
aVnine of the top 10 links were about the quake.
p168
aVPeople collating information,
p169
aVpointing people to news sources,
p170
aVpointing people to the US geological survey.
p171
aVThe 10th one was kittens on a treadmill, but that's the Internet for you.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VBut nine of the 10 in those first hours.
p176
aVAnd within half a day donation sites were up,
p177
aVand donations were pouring in from all around the world.
p178
aVThis was an incredible, coordinated global response.
p179
aVAnd the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness,
p180
aVdecided that they were going to let it go,
p181
aVthat they were going to let this citizen reporting fly.
p182
aVAnd then this happened.
p183
aVPeople began to figure out, in the Sichuan Provence,
p184
aVthat the reason so many school buildings had collapsed \u2014
p185
aVbecause tragically the earthquake happened during a school day \u2014
p186
aVthe reason so many school buildings collapsed
p187
aVis that corrupt officials had taken bribes
p188
aVto allow those building to be built to less than code.
p189
aVAnd so they started, the citizen journalists started
p190
aa(lp191
Vreporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture.
p192
aVYou may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times.
p193
aVA local official literally prostrated himself in the street,
p194
aVin front of these protesters,
p195
aVin order to get them to go away.
p196
aVEssentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you,
p197
aVjust please stop protesting in public."
p198
aa(lp199
VBut these are people who have been radicalized,
p200
aVbecause, thanks to the one child policy,
p201
aVthey have lost everyone in their next generation.
p202
aVSomeone who has seen the death of a single child
p203
aVnow has nothing to lose.
p204
aVAnd so the protest kept going.
p205
aVAnd finally the Chinese cracked down.
p206
aVThat was enough of citizen media.
p207
aVAnd so they began to arrest the protesters.
p208
aVThey began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on.
p209
aa(lp210
VChina is probably the most successful
p211
aVmanager of Internet censorship in the world,
p212
aVusing something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China.
p213
aVAnd the Great Firewall of China
p214
aVis a set of observation points
p215
aVthat assume that media is produced by professionals,
p216
aVit mostly comes in from the outside world,
p217
aVit comes in relatively sparse chunks,
p218
aVand it comes in relatively slowly.
p219
aVAnd because of those four characteristics
p220
aVthey are able to filter it as it comes into the country.
p221
aVBut like the Maginot Line,
p222
aVthe great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction
p223
aVfor this challenge,
p224
aVbecause not one of those four things was true in this environment.
p225
aVThe media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs.
p226
aVIt was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance
p227
aVthat there was no way to filter it as it appeared.
p228
aVAnd so now the Chinese government, who for a dozen years,
p229
aVhas quite successfully filtered the web,
p230
aVis now in the position of having to decide
p231
aVwhether to allow or shut down entire services,
p232
aVbecause the transformation to amateur media
p233
aVis so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd in fact that is happening this week.
p236
aVOn the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen
p237
aVthey just, two days ago, announced
p238
aVthat they were simply shutting down access to Twitter,
p239
aVbecause there was no way to filter it other than that.
p240
aVThey had to turn the spigot entirely off.
p241
aVNow these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages.
p242
aVThey also affect people who want to send messages,
p243
aa(lp244
Vbecause this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole,
p245
aVnot just a particular strategy.
p246
aVThe classic media problem, from the 20th century
p247
aVis, how does an organization have a message
p248
aVthat they want to get out
p249
aVto a group of people distributed at the edges of a network.
p250
aVAnd here is the twentieth century answer.
p251
aVBundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody.
p252
aVNational message. Targeted individuals.
p253
aVRelatively sparse number of producers.
p254
aVVery expensive to do,
p255
aVso there is not a lot of competition.
p256
aVThis is how you reach people.
p257
aVAll of that is over.
p258
aa(lp259
VWe are increasingly in a landscape where media is global,
p260
aVsocial, ubiquitous and cheap.
p261
aVNow most organizations that are trying to send messages
p262
aVto the outside world, to the distributed collection of the audience,
p263
aVare now used to this change.
p264
aVThe audience can talk back.
p265
aVAnd that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while, as people do.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.
p268
aVThe really crazy change is here:
p269
aVit's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other,
p270
aVthe fact that former consumers are now producers,
p271
aVthe fact that the audience can talk directly to one another;
p272
aVbecause there is a lot more amateurs than professionals,
p273
aVand because the size of the network,
p274
aVthe complexity of the network is actually the square
p275
aVof the number of participants,
p276
aVmeaning that the network, when it grows large,
p277
aVgrows very, very large.
p278
aa(lp279
VAs recently at last decade,
p280
aVmost of the media that was available for public consumption
p281
aVwas produced by professionals.
p282
aVThose days are over, never to return.
p283
aVIt is the green lines now, that are the source of the free content,
p284
aVwhich brings me to my last story.
p285
aVWe saw some of the most imaginative use
p286
aVof social media during the Obama campaign.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd I don't mean most imaginative use in politics \u2014
p289
aVI mean most imaginative use ever.
p290
aVAnd one of the things Obama did, was they famously,
p291
aVthe Obama campaign did, was they famously put up
p292
aVMyBarackObama.com, myBO.com
p293
aVAnd millions of citizens rushed in to participate,
p294
aVand to try and figure out how to help.
p295
aVAn incredible conversation sprung up there.
p296
aVAnd then, this time last year,
p297
aVObama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA,
p298
aVThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
p299
aVHe had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill
p300
aVthat granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying
p301
aVon American persons.
p302
aVBy the summer, in the middle of the general campaign,
p303
aVHe said, "I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind.
p304
aVI'm going to vote for this bill."
p305
aVAnd many of his own supporters
p306
aVon his own site went very publicly berserk.
p307
aa(lp308
VIt was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.
p309
aV"Please get FISA right."
p310
aVWithin days of this group being created
p311
aVit was the fastest growing group on myBO.com;
p312
aVwithin weeks of its being created it was the largest group.
p313
aVObama had to issue a press release.
p314
aVHe had to issue a reply.
p315
aVAnd he said essentially, "I have considered the issue.
p316
aVI understand where you are coming from.
p317
aVBut having considered it all, I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote.
p318
aVBut I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me,
p319
aVand I'm going to take my lumps on this one."
p320
aa(lp321
VThis didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation.
p322
aVPeople in that group realized
p323
aVthat Obama had never shut them down.
p324
aVNobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group
p325
aVor make it harder to join,
p326
aVto deny its existence, to delete it,
p327
aVto take to off the site.
p328
aVThey had understood that their role
p329
aVwith myBO.com was to convene their supporters
p330
aVbut not to control their supporters.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd that is the kind of discipline
p333
aVthat it takes to make really mature use
p334
aVof this media.
p335
aVMedia, the media landscape that we knew,
p336
aVas familiar as it was, as easy conceptually as it was
p337
aVto deal with the idea that professionals broadcast
p338
aVmessages to amateurs,
p339
aVis increasingly slipping away.
p340
aVIn a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap,
p341
aVin a world of media where the former audience
p342
aVare now increasingly full participants,
p343
aVin that world, media is less and less often
p344
aVabout crafting a single message
p345
aVto be consumed by individuals.
p346
aVIt is more and more often
p347
aVa way of creating an environment for convening
p348
aVand supporting groups.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd the choice we face,
p351
aVI mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard
p352
aVanywhere in the world,
p353
aVisn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.
p354
aVThat's the media environment we've got.
p355
aVThe question we all face now is,
p356
aV"How can we make best use of this media?
p357
aVEven though it means changing the way we've always done it."
p358
aVThank you very much.

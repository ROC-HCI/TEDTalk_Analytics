VI've been intrigued by this question
p5
aVof whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense \u2014
p6
aVa sense that would give us seamless access
p7
aVand easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere
p8
aVthat may be relevant to help us make the right decision
p9
aVabout whatever it is that we're coming across.
p10
aVAnd some of you may argue,
p11
aV"Well, don't today's cell phones do that already?"
p12
aVBut I would say no.
p13
aVWhen you meet someone here at TED \u2014
p14
aVand this is the top networking place, of course, of the year \u2014
p15
aVyou don't shake somebody's hand
p16
aVand then say, "Can you hold on for a moment
p17
aVwhile I take out my phone and Google you?"
p18
aVOr when you go to the supermarket
p19
aVand you're standing there in that huge aisle
p20
aVof different types of toilet papers,
p21
aVyou don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser,
p22
aVand go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers
p23
aVis the most ecologically responsible purchase to make.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information
p26
aVthat can just help us make optimal decisions
p27
aVabout what to do next and what actions to take.
p28
aVAnd so my research group at the Media Lab
p29
aVhas been developing a series of inventions
p30
aVto give us access to this information in a sort of easy way,
p31
aVwithout requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.
p32
aVAnd I'm here to unveil our latest effort,
p33
aVand most successful effort so far,
p34
aVwhich is still very much a work in process.
p35
aVI'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together
p36
aVwith components that are off the shelf \u2014
p37
aVand that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time.
p38
aa(lp39
VI'm wearing a camera, just a simple web cam,
p40
aVa portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror.
p41
aVThese components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket
p42
aVwhich acts as the communication and computation device.
p43
aVAnd in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry,
p44
aVwho's really the genius who's been implementing
p45
aVand designing this whole system.
p46
aVAnd we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface
p47
aVand start using his hands to interact with the information
p48
aVthat is projected in front of him.
p49
aVThe system tracks the four significant fingers.
p50
aVIn this case, he's wearing simple marker caps
p51
aVthat you may recognize.
p52
aVBut if you want a more stylish version,
p53
aVyou could also paint your nails in different colors.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd the camera basically tracks these four fingers
p56
aVand recognizes any gestures that he's making
p57
aVso he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach,
p58
aVzoom in and out, etc.
p59
aVThe system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the "take a picture" gesture,
p60
aVand then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.
p61
aVAnd when he then walks back to the Media Lab,
p62
aVhe can just go up to any wall
p63
aVand project all the pictures that he's taken,
p64
aVsort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc.,
p65
aVagain using all natural gestures.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo, some of you most likely were here two years ago
p68
aVand saw the demo by Jeff Han, or some of you may think,
p69
aV"Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"
p70
aVAnd yes, you also interact using natural gestures,
p71
aVboth hands, etc.
p72
aVBut the difference here is that you can use any surface,
p73
aVyou can walk up to any surface,
p74
aVincluding your hand, if nothing else is available,
p75
aVand interact with this projected data.
p76
aVThe device is completely portable, and can be \u2014
p77
aa(lp78
V(Applause)
p79
aa(lp80
V(Applause ends)
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, one important difference is that it's totally mobile.
p83
aVAnother even more important difference is that in mass production,
p84
aVthis would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones
p85
aVand would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging \u2014
p86
aVcould look a lot more stylish
p87
aVthan this version that I'm wearing around my neck.
p88
aVBut other than letting some of you live out your fantasy
p89
aVof looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report,"
p90
aVthe reason why we're really excited about this device
p91
aVis that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices
p92
aVthat gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you.
p93
aVSo we see Pranav here going into the supermarket
p94
aVand he's shopping for some paper towels.
p95
aVAnd, as he picks up a product,
p96
aVthe system can recognize the product that he's picking up,
p97
aVusing either image recognition or marker technology,
p98
aVand give him the green light or an orange light.
p99
aVHe can ask for additional information.
p100
aVSo this particular choice here
p101
aVis a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.
p102
aVSome of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it
p103
aVrather than the most ecologically responsible choice.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VIf he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating \u2014
p108
aVit gets projected right on the cover of the book.
p109
aVThis is Juan's book, our previous speaker,
p110
aVwhich gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon.
p111
aVAnd so, Pranav turns the page of the book
p112
aVand can then see additional information about the book \u2014
p113
aVreader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc.
p114
aVIf he turns to a particular page,
p115
aVhe finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours
p116
aVthat gives him a little bit of additional information
p117
aVabout whatever is on that particular page.
p118
aVReading the newspaper \u2014 it never has to be outdated.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VYou can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about.
p123
aVYou can get the latest sports scores, etc.
p124
aVThis is a more controversial one.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VAs you interact with someone at TED,
p129
aVmaybe you can see a word cloud of the tags,
p130
aVthe words that are associated with that person
p131
aVin their blog and personal web pages.
p132
aVIn this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
p133
aVOn your way to the airport,
p134
aVif you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed,
p135
aVthat the gate has changed, etc.
p136
aVAnd, if you need to know what the current time is,
p137
aVit's as simple as drawing a watch \u2014
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
V(Applause)
p142
aa(lp143
Von your arm.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense
p146
aVthat would give us seamless access to all this relevant information
p147
aVabout the things that we may come across.
p148
aVMy student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Applause and cheering)
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause ends)
p153
aa(lp154
VHe does deserve a lot of applause,
p155
aVbecause I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually.
p156
aVAnd his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either.
p157
aVBut it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress.
p158
aVAnd who knows, maybe in another 10 years
p159
aVwe'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant.
p160
aa(lp161
VThank you.

In the 1990s, Maes&#39; Software Agents program at MIT created Firefly, a technology (and then a startup sold to Microsoft) that let users choose songs they liked, and find similar songs they&#39;d never heard of, by taking cues from others with similar taste. This brought a sea change in the way we interact with software, with culture and with one another.<br /><br />Now Maes is working on a similarly boundary-breaking initiative. She founded Fluid Interfaces Group, also part of the MIT Media Lab, to rethink the ways in which humans and computers interact, partially by redefining both human and computer. In Maes&#39; world (and really, in all of ours), the computer is no longer a distinct object, but a source of intelligence that&#39;s embedded in our environment. By outfitting ourselves with digital accessories, we can continually learn from (and teach) our surroundings. The uses of this tech -- from healthcare to home furnishings, warfare to supermarkets -- are powerful and increasingly real.               <!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face \\t{font-family:\\"\\uff2d\\uff33 \\u660e\\u671d\\"; \\tmso-font-charset:78; \\tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \\tmso-font-pitch:variable; \\tmso-font-signature:1 134676480 16 0 131072 0;} @font-face \\t{font-family:\\"Cambria Math\\"; \\tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \\tmso-font-charset:0; \\tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \\tmso-font-pitch:variable; \\tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;} @font-face \\t{font-family:Cambria; \\tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \\tmso-font-charset:0; \\tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \\tmso-font-pitch:variable; \\tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;}  /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \\t{mso-style-unhide:no; \\tmso-style-qformat:yes; \\tmso-style-parent:\\"\\"; \\tmargin:0in; \\tmargin-bottom:.0001pt; \\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \\tfont-size:12.0pt; \\tfont-family:Cambria; \\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \\tmso-fareast-font-family:\\"\\uff2d\\uff33 \\u660e\\u671d\\"; \\tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \\tmso-bidi-font-family:\\"Times New Roman\\"; \\tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} .MsoChpDefault \\t{mso-style-type:export-only; \\tmso-default-props:yes; \\tfont-family:Cambria; \\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \\tmso-fareast-font-family:\\"\\uff2d\\uff33 \\u660e\\u671d\\"; \\tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \\tmso-bidi-font-family:\\"Times New Roman\\"; \\tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} @page WordSection1 \\t{size:8.5in 11.0in; \\tmargin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; \\tmso-header-margin:.5in; \\tmso-footer-margin:.5in; \\tmso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1 \\t{page:WordSection1;} --> </p>", "slug": "pattie_maes", "whotheyare": "As head of the MIT Media Lab\'s Fluid Interfaces Group, Pattie Maes researches the tools we use to work with information and connect with one another.", "whatotherssay": "We like to invent new disciplines or look at new problems, and invent bandwagons rather than jump on them.", "id": 362, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/76604_254x191.jpg"}, {"description": "Director of research, Samsung Research America", "firstname": "Pranav", "title": "", "lastname": "Mistry", "middleinitial": "", "whylisten": "<p>When Pranav Mistry was a PhD student in the Fluid Interfaces Group at MIT&#39;s Media Lab, he worked with lab director Pattie Maes to create some of the most entertaining and thought-provoking interfaces the world had ever seen.

what was once called &quot;collaborative filtering&quot; and has become a key to Web 2.0: the immense engine of recommendations -- or &quot;things like this&quot; -- fueled by other users. In the 1990s, Maes&#39; Software Agents program at MIT created Firefly, a technology (and then a startup sold to Microsoft) that let users choose songs they liked, and find similar songs they&#39;d never heard of, by taking cues from others with similar taste. This brought a sea change in the way we interact with software, with culture and with one another.<br /><br />Now Maes is working on a similarly boundary-breaking initiative. She founded Fluid Interfaces Group, also part of the MIT Media Lab, to rethink the ways in which humans and computers interact, partially by redefining both human and computer. In Maes&#39; world (and really, in all of ours), the computer is no longer a distinct object, but a source of intelligence that&#39;s embedded in our environment. By outfitting ourselves with digital accessories, we can continually learn from (and teach) our surroundings. The uses of this tech -- from healthcare to home furnishings, warfare to supermarkets -- are powerful and increasingly real.               <!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face \\t{font-family:\\"\\uff2d\\uff33 \\u660e\\u671d\\"; \\tmso-font-charset:78; \\tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \\tmso-font-pitch:variable; \\tmso-font-signature:1 134676480 16 0 131072 0;} @font-face \\t{font-family:\\"Cambria Math\\"; \\tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \\tmso-font-charset:0; \\tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \\tmso-font-pitch:variable; \\tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;} @font-face \\t{font-family:Cambria; \\tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \\tmso-font-charset:0; \\tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \\tmso-font-pitch:variable; \\tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;}  /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \\t{mso-style-unhide:no; \\tmso-style-qformat:yes; \\tmso-style-parent:\\"\\"; \\tmargin:0in; \\tmargin-bottom:.0001pt; \\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \\tfont-size:12.0pt; \\tfont-family:Cambria; \\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \\tmso-fareast-font-family:\\"\\uff2d\\uff33 \\u660e\\u671d\\"; \\tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \\tmso-bidi-font-family:\\"Times New Roman\\"; \\tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} .MsoChpDefault \\t{mso-style-type:export-only; \\tmso-default-props:yes; \\tfont-family:Cambria; \\tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \\tmso-fareast-font-family:\\"\\uff2d\\uff33 \\u660e\\u671d\\"; \\tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \\tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \\tmso-bidi-font-family:\\"Times New Roman\\"; \\tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} @page WordSection1 \\t{size:8.5in 11.0in; \\tmargin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; \\tmso-header-margin:.5in; \\tmso-footer-margin:.5in; \\tmso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1 \\t{page:WordSection1;} --> </p>", "slug": "pattie_maes", "whotheyare": "As head of the MIT Media Lab\'s Fluid Interfaces Group, Pattie Maes researches the tools we use to work with information and connect with one another.", "whatotherssay": "We like to invent new disciplines or look at new problems, and invent bandwagons rather than jump on them.", "id": 362, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/76604_254x191.jpg"}, {"description": "Director of research, Samsung Research America", "firstname": "Pranav", "title": "", "lastname": "Mistry", "middleinitial": "", "whylisten": "<p>When Pranav Mistry was a PhD student in the Fluid Interfaces Group at MIT&#39;s Media Lab, he worked with lab director Pattie Maes to create some of the most entertaining and thought-provoking interfaces the world had ever seen.

VWhy does the universe exist?
p5
aVWhy is there \u2014 Okay. Okay. (Laughter)
p6
aVThis is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.
p7
aVWhy is there a world, why are we in it,
p8
aVand why is there something rather than nothing at all?
p9
aVI mean, this is the super ultimate "why" question?
p10
aa(lp11
VSo I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence,
p12
aVthe puzzle of existence,
p13
aVwhere we are now in addressing it,
p14
aVand why you should care,
p15
aVand I hope you do care.
p16
aVThe philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that
p17
aVthose who don't wonder about the contingency of their existence,
p18
aVof the contingency of the world's existence,
p19
aVare mentally deficient.
p20
aVThat's a little harsh, but still. (Laughter)
p21
aVSo this has been called the most sublime
p22
aVand awesome mystery,
p23
aVthe deepest and most far-reaching question
p24
aVman can pose.
p25
aVIt's obsessed great thinkers.
p26
aVLudwig Wittgenstein, perhaps the greatest
p27
aVphilosopher of the 20th century,
p28
aVwas astonished that there should be a world at all.
p29
aVHe wrote in his "Tractatus," Proposition 4.66,
p30
aV"It is not how things are in the world
p31
aVthat is the mystical,
p32
aVit's that the world exists."
p33
aVAnd if you don't like taking your epigrams
p34
aVfrom a philosopher, try a scientist.
p35
aVJohn Archibald Wheeler, one of the great physicists
p36
aVof the 20th century,
p37
aVthe teacher of Richard Feynman,
p38
aVthe coiner of the term "black hole,"
p39
aVhe said, "I want to know
p40
aVhow come the quantum,
p41
aVhow come the universe, how come existence?"
p42
aVAnd my friend Martin Amis \u2014
p43
aVsorry that I'll be doing a lot of name-dropping in this talk,
p44
aVso get used to it \u2014
p45
aVmy dear friend Martin Amis once said
p46
aVthat we're about five Einsteins away from answering
p47
aVthe mystery of where the universe came from.
p48
aVAnd I've no doubt there are five Einsteins
p49
aVin the audience tonight.
p50
aVAny Einsteins? Show of hands? No? No? No?
p51
aVNo Einsteins? Okay.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo this question, why is there something rather than nothing,
p54
aVthis sublime question, was posed rather late
p55
aVin intellectual history.
p56
aVIt was towards the end of the 17th century,
p57
aVthe philosopher Leibniz who asked it,
p58
aVa very smart guy, Leibniz,
p59
aVwho invented the calculus
p60
aVindependently of Isaac Newton, at about the same time,
p61
aVbut for Leibniz, who asked why is there something rather than nothing,
p62
aVthis was not a great mystery.
p63
aVHe either was or pretended to be
p64
aVan Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook,
p65
aVand he said it's obvious why the world exists:
p66
aVbecause God created it.
p67
aVAnd God created, indeed, out of nothing at all.
p68
aVThat's how powerful God is.
p69
aVHe doesn't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of.
p70
aVHe can make it out of sheer nothingness,
p71
aVcreation ex nihilo.
p72
aVAnd by the way, this is what
p73
aVmost Americans today believe.
p74
aVThere is no mystery of existence for them.
p75
aVGod made it.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo let's put this in an equation.
p78
aVI don't have any slides so I'm going to mime my visuals,
p79
aVso use your imaginations.
p80
aVSo it's God + nothing = the world.
p81
aVOkay? Now that's the equation.
p82
aVAnd so maybe you don't believe in God.
p83
aVMaybe you're a scientific atheist
p84
aVor an unscientific atheist, and you don't believe in God,
p85
aVand you're not happy with it.
p86
aVBy the way, even if we have this equation,
p87
aVGod + nothing = the world,
p88
aVthere's already a problem:
p89
aVWhy does God exist?
p90
aVGod doesn't exist by logic alone
p91
aVunless you believe the ontological argument,
p92
aVand I hope you don't, because it's not a good argument.
p93
aVSo it's conceivable, if God were to exist,
p94
aVhe might wonder, I'm eternal, I'm all-powerful,
p95
aVbut where did I come from?
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVWhence then am I?
p98
aVGod speaks in a more formal English.
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVAnd so one theory is that God was so bored with
p101
aVpondering the puzzle of His own existence
p102
aVthat He created the world just to distract himself.
p103
aVBut anyway, let's forget about God.
p104
aVTake God out of the equation: We have
p105
aV________ + nothing = the world.
p106
aVNow, if you're a Buddhist,
p107
aVyou might want to stop right there,
p108
aVbecause essentially what you've got is
p109
aVnothing = the world,
p110
aVand by symmetry of identity, that means
p111
aVthe world = nothing. Okay?
p112
aVAnd to a Buddhist, the world is just a whole lot of nothing.
p113
aVIt's just a big cosmic vacuity.
p114
aVAnd we think there's a lot of something out there
p115
aVbut that's because we're enslaved by our desires.
p116
aVIf we let our desires melt away,
p117
aVwe'll see the world for what it truly is,
p118
aVa vacuity, nothingness,
p119
aVand we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana
p120
aVwhich has been defined as having
p121
aVjust enough life to enjoy being dead. (Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VSo that's the Buddhist thinking.
p124
aVBut I'm a Westerner, and I'm still concerned
p125
aVwith the puzzle of existence, so I've got
p126
aV________ + \u2014
p127
aVthis is going to get serious in a minute, so \u2014
p128
aV________ + nothing = the world.
p129
aVWhat are we going to put in that blank?
p130
aVWell, how about science?
p131
aVScience is our best guide to the nature of reality,
p132
aVand the most fundamental science is physics.
p133
aVThat tells us what naked reality really is,
p134
aVthat reveals what I call TAUFOTU,
p135
aVthe True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe.
p136
aVSo maybe physics can fill this blank,
p137
aVand indeed, since about the late 1960s or around 1970,
p138
aVphysicists have purported to give
p139
aVa purely scientific explanation of how
p140
aVa universe like ours could have popped into existence
p141
aVout of sheer nothingness,
p142
aVa quantum fluctuation out of the void.
p143
aVStephen Hawking is one of these physicists,
p144
aVmore recently Alex Vilenkin,
p145
aVand the whole thing has been popularized
p146
aVby another very fine physicist and friend of mine,
p147
aVLawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called
p148
aV"A Universe from Nothing,"
p149
aVand Lawrence thinks that he's given \u2014
p150
aVhe's a militant atheist, by the way,
p151
aVso he's gotten God out of the picture.
p152
aVThe laws of quantum field theory,
p153
aVthe state-of-the-art physics, can show how
p154
aVout of sheer nothingness,
p155
aVno space, no time, no matter, nothing,
p156
aVa little nugget of false vacuum
p157
aVcan fluctuate into existence,
p158
aVand then, by the miracle of inflation,
p159
aVblow up into this huge and variegated cosmos
p160
aVwe see around us.
p161
aa(lp162
VOkay, this is a really ingenious scenario.
p163
aVIt's very speculative. It's fascinating.
p164
aVBut I've got a big problem with it,
p165
aVand the problem is this:
p166
aVIt's a pseudo-religious point of view.
p167
aVNow, Lawrence thinks he's an atheist,
p168
aVbut he's still in thrall to a religious worldview.
p169
aVHe sees physical laws as being like divine commands.
p170
aVThe laws of quantum field theory for him
p171
aVare like fiat lux, "Let there be light."
p172
aVThe laws have some sort of ontological power or clout
p173
aVthat they can form the abyss,
p174
aVthat it's pregnant with being.
p175
aVThey can call a world into existence out of nothing.
p176
aVBut that's a very primitive view of what
p177
aVa physical law is, right?
p178
aVWe know that physical laws are actually
p179
aVgeneralized descriptions of patterns and regularities
p180
aVin the world.
p181
aVThey don't exist outside the world.
p182
aVThey don't have any ontic cloud of their own.
p183
aVThey can't call a world into existence
p184
aVout of nothingness.
p185
aVThat's a very primitive view
p186
aVof what a scientific law is.
p187
aVAnd if you don't believe me on this,
p188
aVlisten to Stephen Hawking,
p189
aVwho himself put forward a model of the cosmos
p190
aVthat was self-contained,
p191
aVdidn't require any outside cause, any creator,
p192
aVand after proposing this,
p193
aVHawking admitted that he was still puzzled.
p194
aVHe said, this model is just equations.
p195
aVWhat breathes fire into the equations
p196
aVand creates a world for them to describe?
p197
aVHe was puzzled by this,
p198
aVso equations themselves can't do the magic,
p199
aVcan't resolve the puzzle of existence.
p200
aVAnd besides, even if the laws could do that,
p201
aVwhy this set of laws?
p202
aVWhy quantum field theory that describes
p203
aVa universe with a certain number of forces
p204
aVand particles and so forth?
p205
aVWhy not a completely different set of laws?
p206
aVThere are many, many mathematically consistent sets of laws.
p207
aVWhy not no laws at all? Why not sheer nothingness?
p208
aa(lp209
VSo this is a problem, believe it or not,
p210
aVthat reflective physicists really think a lot about,
p211
aVand at this point they tend to go metaphysical,
p212
aVsay, well, maybe the set of laws
p213
aVthat describes our universe,
p214
aVit's just one set of laws
p215
aVand it describes one part of reality,
p216
aVbut maybe every consistent set of laws
p217
aVdescribes another part of reality,
p218
aVand in fact all possible physical worlds
p219
aVreally exist, they're all out there.
p220
aVWe just see a little tiny part of reality
p221
aVthat's described by the laws of quantum field theory,
p222
aVbut there are many, many other worlds,
p223
aVparts of reality that are described
p224
aVby vastly different theories
p225
aVthat are different from ours in ways we can't imagine,
p226
aVthat are inconceivably exotic.
p227
aVSteven Weinberg, the father
p228
aVof the standard model of particle physics,
p229
aVhas actually flirted with this idea himself,
p230
aVthat all possible realities actually exist.
p231
aVAlso, a younger physicist, Max Tegmark,
p232
aVwho believes that all mathematical structures exist,
p233
aVand mathematical existence is the same thing
p234
aVas physical existence,
p235
aVso we have this vastly rich multiverse
p236
aVthat encompasses every logical possibility.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow, in taking this metaphysical way out,
p239
aVthese physicists and also philosophers are actually
p240
aVreaching back to a very old idea
p241
aVthat goes back to Plato.
p242
aVIt's the principle of plenitude or fecundity,
p243
aVor the great chain of being,
p244
aVthat reality is actually as full as possible.
p245
aVIt's as far removed from nothingness
p246
aVas it could possibly be.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo we have these two extremes now.
p249
aVWe have sheer nothingness on one side,
p250
aVand we have this vision of a reality
p251
aVthat encompasses every conceivable world
p252
aVat the other extreme: the fullest possible reality,
p253
aVnothingness, the simplest possible reality.
p254
aVNow what's in between these two extremes?
p255
aVThere are all kinds of intermediate realities
p256
aVthat include some things and leave out others.
p257
aVSo one of these intermediate realities
p258
aVis, say, the most mathematically elegant reality,
p259
aVthat leaves out the inelegant bits,
p260
aVthe ugly asymmetries and so forth.
p261
aVNow, there are some physicists who will tell you
p262
aVthat we're actually living in the most elegant reality.
p263
aVI think that Brian Greene is in the audience,
p264
aVand he has written a book called "The Elegant Universe."
p265
aVHe claims that the universe we live in mathematically
p266
aVis very elegant.
p267
aVDon't believe him. (Laughter)
p268
aVIt's a pious hope, I wish it were true,
p269
aVbut I think the other day he admitted to me
p270
aVit's really an ugly universe.
p271
aVIt's stupidly constructed,
p272
aVit's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants
p273
aVand mass ratios
p274
aVand superfluous families of elementary particles,
p275
aVand what the hell is dark energy?
p276
aVIt's a stick and bubble gum contraption.
p277
aVIt's not an elegant universe. (Laughter)
p278
aVAnd then there's the best of all possible worlds
p279
aVin an ethical sense.
p280
aVYou should get solemn now,
p281
aVbecause a world in which sentient beings
p282
aVdon't suffer needlessly,
p283
aVin which there aren't things like
p284
aVchildhood cancer or the Holocaust.
p285
aVThis is an ethical conception.
p286
aVAnyway, so between nothingness
p287
aVand the fullest possible reality,
p288
aVvarious special realities.
p289
aVNothingness is special. It's the simplest.
p290
aVThen there's the most elegant possible reality.
p291
aVThat's special.
p292
aVThe fullest possible reality, that's special.
p293
aa(lp294
VBut what are we leaving out here?
p295
aVThere's also just the crummy,
p296
aVgeneric realities
p297
aVthat aren't special in any way,
p298
aVthat are sort of random.
p299
aVThey're infinitely removed from nothingness,
p300
aVbut they fall infinitely short of complete fullness.
p301
aVThey're a mixture of chaos and order,
p302
aVof mathematical elegance and ugliness.
p303
aVSo I would describe these realities
p304
aVas an infinite, mediocre, incomplete mess,
p305
aVa generic reality, a kind of cosmic junk shot.
p306
aVAnd these realities,
p307
aVis there a deity in any of these realities?
p308
aVMaybe, but the deity isn't perfect
p309
aVlike the Judeo-Christian deity.
p310
aVThe deity isn't all-good and all-powerful.
p311
aVIt might be instead 100 percent malevolent
p312
aVbut only 80 percent effective,
p313
aVwhich pretty much describes the world we see around us, I think. (Laughter)
p314
aVSo I would like to propose that the resolution
p315
aVto the mystery of existence
p316
aVis that the reality we exist in
p317
aVis one of these generic realities.
p318
aVReality has to turn out some way.
p319
aVIt can either turn out to be nothing
p320
aVor everything or something in between.
p321
aVSo if it has some special feature,
p322
aVlike being really elegant or really full
p323
aVor really simple, like nothingness,
p324
aVthat would require an explanation.
p325
aVBut if it's just one of these random, generic realities,
p326
aVthere's no further explanation for it.
p327
aVAnd indeed, I would say
p328
aVthat's the reality we live in.
p329
aVThat's what science is telling us.
p330
aVAt the beginning of the week,
p331
aVwe got the exciting information that
p332
aVthe theory of inflation, which predicts a big,
p333
aVinfinite, messy, arbitrary, pointless reality,
p334
aVit's like a big frothing champagne
p335
aVcoming out of a bottle endlessly,
p336
aVa vast universe, mostly a wasteland
p337
aVwith little pockets of charm and order and peace,
p338
aVthis has been confirmed,
p339
aVthis inflationary scenario, by the observations
p340
aVmade by radio telescopes in Antarctica
p341
aVthat looked at the signature of the gravitational waves
p342
aVfrom just before the Big Bang.
p343
aVI'm sure you all know about this.
p344
aVSo anyway, I think there's some evidence
p345
aVthat this really is the reality that we're stuck with.
p346
aa(lp347
VNow, why should you care?
p348
aVWell \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p349
aVthe question, "Why does the world exist?"
p350
aVthat's the cosmic question, it sort of rhymes
p351
aVwith a more intimate question:
p352
aVWhy do I exist? Why do you exist?
p353
aVyou know, our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable,
p354
aVbecause there's an enormous number of genetically possible humans,
p355
aVif you can compute it by looking at
p356
aVthe number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth,
p357
aVand a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you
p358
aVthere are about 10 to the 10,000th
p359
aVpossible humans, genetically.
p360
aVThat's between a googol and a googolplex.
p361
aVAnd the number of the actual humans that have existed
p362
aVis 100 billion, maybe 50 billion,
p363
aVan infinitesimal fraction, so all of us,
p364
aVwe've won this amazing cosmic lottery.
p365
aVWe're here. Okay.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo what kind of reality do we want to live in?
p368
aVDo we want to live in a special reality?
p369
aVWhat if we were living in the most elegant possible reality?
p370
aVImagine the existential pressure on us
p371
aVto live up to that, to be elegant,
p372
aVnot to pull down the tone of it.
p373
aVOr, what if we were living in the fullest possible reality?
p374
aVWell then our existence would be guaranteed,
p375
aVbecause every possible thing
p376
aVexists in that reality,
p377
aVbut our choices would be meaningless.
p378
aVIf I really struggle morally and agonize
p379
aVand I decide to do the right thing,
p380
aVwhat difference does it make,
p381
aVbecause there are an infinite number
p382
aVof versions of me
p383
aValso doing the right thing
p384
aVand an infinite number doing the wrong thing.
p385
aVSo my choices are meaningless.
p386
aVSo we don't want to live in that special reality.
p387
aVAnd as for the special reality of nothingness,
p388
aVwe wouldn't be having this conversation.
p389
aVSo I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre,
p390
aVthere are nasty bits and nice bits
p391
aVand we could make the nice bits bigger
p392
aVand the nasty bits smaller
p393
aVand that gives us a kind of purpose in life.
p394
aVThe universe is absurd,
p395
aVbut we can still construct a purpose,
p396
aVand that's a pretty good one,
p397
aVand the overall mediocrity of reality
p398
aVkind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity
p399
aVwe all feel in the core of our being.
p400
aVAnd I know you feel it.
p401
aVI know you're all special,
p402
aVbut you're still kind of secretly mediocre,
p403
aVdon't you think?
p404
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VSo anyway, you may say, this  puzzle, the mystery of existence,
p407
aVit's just silly mystery-mongering.
p408
aVYou're not astonished at the existence of the universe
p409
aVand you're in good company.
p410
aVBertrand Russell said,
p411
aV"I should say the universe is just there, and that's all."
p412
aVJust a brute fact.
p413
aVAnd my professor at Columbia, Sidney Morgenbesser,
p414
aVa great philosophical wag,
p415
aVwhen I said to him, "Professor Morgenbesser,
p416
aVwhy is there something rather than nothing?"
p417
aVAnd he said, "Oh, even if there was nothing,
p418
aVyou still wouldn't be satisfied."
p419
aa(lp420
VSo \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 okay.
p421
aVSo you're not astonished. I don't care.
p422
aVBut I will tell you something to conclude
p423
aVthat I guarantee you will astonish you,
p424
aVbecause it's astonished all of the brilliant,
p425
aVwonderful people I've met at this TED conference,
p426
aVwhen I've told them, and it's this:
p427
aVNever in my life have I had a cell phone.
p428
aVThank you.

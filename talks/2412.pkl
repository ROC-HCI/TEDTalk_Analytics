VI believe that the secret to producing extremely drought-tolerant crops,
p5
aVwhich should go some way to providing food security in the world,
p6
aVlies in resurrection plants,
p7
aVpictured here, in an extremely droughted state.
p8
aVYou might think that these plants look dead,
p9
aVbut they're not.
p10
aVGive them water,
p11
aVand they will resurrect, green up, start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, why would I suggest
p14
aVthat producing drought-tolerant crops will go towards providing food security?
p15
aVWell, the current world population is around 7 billion.
p16
aVAnd it's estimated that by 2050,
p17
aVwe'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,
p18
aVwith the bulk of this growth happening in Africa.
p19
aa(lp20
VThe food and agricultural organizations of the world
p21
aVhave suggested that we need a 70 percent increase
p22
aVin current agricultural practice
p23
aVto meet that demand.
p24
aVGiven that plants are at the base of the food chain,
p25
aVmost of that's going to have to come from plants.
p26
aa(lp27
VThat percentage of 70 percent
p28
aVdoes not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change.
p29
aa(lp30
VThis is taken from a study by Dai published in 2011,
p31
aVwhere he took into consideration
p32
aVall the potential effects of climate change
p33
aVand expressed them \u2014 amongst other things \u2014
p34
aVincreased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain.
p35
aVThe areas in red shown here,
p36
aVare areas that until recently
p37
aVhave been very successfully used for agriculture,
p38
aVbut cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall.
p39
aVThis is the situation that's predicted to happen in 2050.
p40
aVMuch of Africa, in fact, much of the world,
p41
aVis going to be in trouble.
p42
aVWe're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food.
p43
aVAnd preferably among them, some drought-tolerant crops.
p44
aa(lp45
VThe other thing to remember about Africa is
p46
aVthat most of their agriculture is rainfed.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, making drought-tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world.
p49
aVAnd the reason for this is water.
p50
aVWater is essential to life on this planet.
p51
aVAll living, actively metabolizing organisms,
p52
aVfrom microbes to you and I,
p53
aVare comprised predominately of water.
p54
aVAll life reactions happen in water.
p55
aVAnd loss of a small amount of water results in death.
p56
aVYou and I are 65 percent water \u2014
p57
aVwe lose one percent of that, we die.
p58
aVBut we can make behavioral changes to avoid that.
p59
aVPlants can't.
p60
aVThey're stuck in the ground.
p61
aVAnd so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us,
p62
aVabout 95 percent water,
p63
aVand they can lose a little bit more than us,
p64
aVlike 10 to about 70 percent, depending on the species,
p65
aVbut for short periods only.
p66
aa(lp67
VMost of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss.
p68
aVSo extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents.
p69
aVThey tend to be small, very attractive,
p70
aVbut they hold onto their water at such great cost
p71
aVthat they grow extremely slowly.
p72
aVExamples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs.
p73
aVThey send down very deep roots,
p74
aVmine subterranean water supplies
p75
aVand just keep flushing it through them at all times,
p76
aVkeeping themselves hydrated.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe one on the right is called a baobab.
p79
aVIt's also called the upside-down tree,
p80
aVsimply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great
p81
aVthat it looks like the tree has been planted upside down.
p82
aVAnd of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals.
p85
aVAnnuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies.
p86
aVUp the west coast of my country,
p87
aVfor much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth.
p88
aVBut come the spring rains, you get this:
p89
aVflowering of the desert.
p90
aa(lp91
VThe strategy in annuals,
p92
aVis to grow only in the rainy season.
p93
aVAt the end of that season they produce a seed,
p94
aVwhich is dry, eight to 10 percent water,
p95
aVbut very much alive.
p96
aVAnd anything that is that dry and still alive,
p97
aVwe call desiccation-tolerant.
p98
aa(lp99
VIn the desiccated state,
p100
aVwhat seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment
p101
aVfor prolonged periods of time.
p102
aVThe next time the rainy season comes,
p103
aVthey germinate and grow,
p104
aVand the whole cycle just starts again.
p105
aa(lp106
VIt's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation-tolerant seeds
p107
aVallowed the colonization and the radiation
p108
aVof flowering plants, or angiosperms, onto land.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut back to annuals as our major form of food supplies.
p111
aVWheat, rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies.
p112
aVAnd it's been a great strategy
p113
aVbecause in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed.
p114
aVSeeds are energy-rich so there's a lot of food calories,
p115
aVyou can store it in times of plenty for times of famine,
p116
aVbut there's a downside.
p117
aVThe vegetative tissues,
p118
aVthe roots and leaves of annuals,
p119
aVdo not have much
p120
aVby way of inherent resistance, avoidance or tolerance characteristics.
p121
aVThey just don't need them.
p122
aVThey grow in the rainy season
p123
aVand they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd so despite concerted efforts in agriculture
p126
aVto make crops with improved properties
p127
aVof resistance, avoidance and tolerance \u2014
p128
aVparticularly resistance and avoidance
p129
aVbecause we've had good models to understand how those work \u2014
p130
aVwe still get images like this.
p131
aVMaize crop in Africa,
p132
aVtwo weeks without rain
p133
aVand it's dead.
p134
aa(lp135
VThere is a solution:
p136
aVresurrection plants.
p137
aVThese plants can lose 95 percent of their cellular water,
p138
aVremain in a dry, dead-like state for months to years,
p139
aVand give them water,
p140
aVthey green up and start growing again.
p141
aVLike seeds, these are desiccation-tolerant.
p142
aVLike seeds, these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions.
p143
aVAnd this is a really rare phenomenon.
p144
aVThere are only 135 flowering plant species that can do this.
p145
aa(lp146
VI'm going to show you a video
p147
aVof the resurrection process of these three species
p148
aVin that order.
p149
aVAnd at the bottom,
p150
aVthere's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VPretty amazing, huh?
p155
aa(lp156
VSo I've spent the last 21 years trying to understand how they do this.
p157
aVHow do these plants dry without dying?
p158
aVAnd I work on a variety of different resurrection plants,
p159
aVshown here in the hydrated and dry states,
p160
aVfor a number of reasons.
p161
aa(lp162
VOne of them is that each of these plants serves as a model
p163
aVfor a crop that I'd like to make drought-tolerant.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo on the extreme top left, for example, is a grass,
p166
aVit's called Eragrostis nindensis,
p167
aVit's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef \u2014
p168
aVa lot of you might know it as "teff" \u2014
p169
aVit's a staple food in Ethiopia,
p170
aVit's gluten-free,
p171
aVand it's something we would like to make drought-tolerant.
p172
aa(lp173
VThe other reason for looking at a number of plants,
p174
aVis that, at least initially,
p175
aVI wanted to find out: do they do the same thing?
p176
aVDo they all use the same mechanisms
p177
aVto be able to lose all that water and not die?
p178
aa(lp179
VSo I undertook what we call a systems biology approach
p180
aVin order to get a comprehensive understanding
p181
aVof desiccation tolerance,
p182
aVin which we look at everything
p183
aVfrom the molecular to the whole plant, ecophysiological level.
p184
aa(lp185
VFor example we look at things like
p186
aVchanges in the plant anatomy as they dried out
p187
aVand their ultrastructure.
p188
aVWe look at the transcriptome, which is just a term for a technology
p189
aVin which we look at the genes
p190
aVthat are switched on or off, in response to drying.
p191
aVMost genes will code for proteins, so we look at the proteome.
p192
aVWhat are the proteins made in response to drying?
p193
aVSome proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites,
p194
aVso we look at the metabolome.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, this is important because plants are stuck in the ground.
p197
aVThey use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal
p198
aVto protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment.
p199
aVSo it's important that we look
p200
aVat the chemical changes involved in drying.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd at the last study that we do at the molecular level,
p203
aVwe look at the lipidome \u2014
p204
aVthe lipid changes in response to drying.
p205
aVAnd that's also important
p206
aVbecause all biological membranes are made of lipids.
p207
aVThey're held as membranes because they're in water.
p208
aVTake away the water, those membranes fall apart.
p209
aVLipids also act as signals to turn on genes.
p210
aa(lp211
VThen we use physiological and biochemical studies
p212
aVto try and understand the function of the putative protectants
p213
aVthat we've actually discovered in our other studies.
p214
aVAnd then use all of that to try and understand
p215
aVhow the plant copes with its natural environment.
p216
aa(lp217
VI've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding
p218
aVof the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance
p219
aVin order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application.
p220
aa(lp221
VI'm sure some of you are thinking,
p222
aV"By biotic application,
p223
aVdoes she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops?"
p224
aVAnd the answer to that question is:
p225
aVdepends on your definition of genetic modification.
p226
aa(lp227
VAll of the crops that we eat today, wheat, rice and maize,
p228
aVare highly genetically modified from their ancestors,
p229
aVbut we don't consider them GM
p230
aVbecause they're being produced by conventional breeding.
p231
aVIf you mean, am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops,
p232
aVyour answer is yes.
p233
aa(lp234
VIn the essence of time, we have tried that approach.
p235
aVMore appropriately, some of my collaborators at UCT,
p236
aVJennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,
p237
aVhave spearheaded that approach
p238
aVand I'm going to show you some data soon.
p239
aa(lp240
VBut we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach,
p241
aVin which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes
p242
aVthat are already present in every crop.
p243
aVThey're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions.
p244
aVI leave it up to you to decide
p245
aVwhether those should be called GM or not.
p246
aa(lp247
VI'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach.
p248
aVAnd in order to do that
p249
aVI have to explain a little bit about how genes work.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo you probably all know
p252
aVthat genes are made of double-stranded DNA.
p253
aVIt's wound very tightly into chromosomes
p254
aVthat are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body.
p255
aVIf you unwind that DNA, you get genes.
p256
aVAnd each gene has a promoter,
p257
aVwhich is just an on-off switch,
p258
aVthe gene coding region,
p259
aVand then a terminator,
p260
aVwhich indicates that this is the end of this gene, the next gene will start.
p261
aa(lp262
VNow, promoters are not simple on-off switches.
p263
aVThey normally require a lot of fine-tuning,
p264
aVlots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on.
p265
aVSo what's typically done in biotech studies
p266
aVis that we use an inducible promoter,
p267
aVwe know how to switch it on.
p268
aVWe couple that to genes of interest
p269
aVand put that into a plant and see how the plant responds.
p270
aa(lp271
VIn the study that I'm going to talk to you about,
p272
aVmy collaborators used a drought-induced promoter,
p273
aVwhich we discovered in a resurrection plant.
p274
aVThe nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing.
p275
aVThe plant itself senses drought.
p276
aVAnd we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants.
p277
aVWhy antioxidant genes?
p278
aVWell, all stresses, particularly drought stress,
p279
aVresults in the formation of free radicals,
p280
aVor reactive oxygen species,
p281
aVwhich are highly damaging and can cause crop death.
p282
aVWhat antioxidants do is stop that damage.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa.
p285
aVTo the left of the arrow are plants without the genes,
p286
aVto the right \u2014
p287
aVplants with the antioxidant genes.
p288
aVAfter three weeks without watering,
p289
aVthe ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow to the final approach.
p292
aVMy research has shown that there's considerable similarity
p293
aVin the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants.
p294
aVSo I ask the question,
p295
aVare they using the same genes?
p296
aVOr slightly differently phrased,
p297
aVare resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance
p298
aVin their roots and leaves?
p299
aVHave they retasked these seed genes
p300
aVin roots and leaves of resurrection plants?
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd I answer that question,
p303
aVas a consequence of a lot of research from my group
p304
aVand recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,
p305
aVMel Oliver in the United States
p306
aVand Julia Buitink in France.
p307
aVThe answer is yes,
p308
aVthat there is a core set of genes that are involved in both.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize,
p311
aVwhere the chromosomes below the off switch
p312
aVrepresent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance.
p313
aVSo as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development,
p314
aVthey switch these genes on.
p315
aVResurrection plants switch on the same genes
p316
aVwhen they dry out.
p317
aVAll modern crops, therefore,
p318
aVhave these genes in their roots and leaves,
p319
aVthey just never switch them on.
p320
aVThey only switch them on in seed tissues.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo what we're trying to do right now
p323
aVis to understand the environmental and cellular signals
p324
aVthat switch on these genes in resurrection plants,
p325
aVto mimic the process in crops.
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd just a final thought.
p328
aVWhat we're trying to do very rapidly
p329
aVis to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants
p330
aVsome 10 to 40 million years ago.
p331
aa(lp332
VMy plants and I thank you for your attention.

VTen years ago exactly,
p5
aVI was in Afghanistan.
p6
aVI was covering the war in Afghanistan,
p7
aVand I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera,
p8
aVthe amount of suffering and destruction
p9
aVthat emerged out of a war like that.
p10
aVThen, two years later,
p11
aVI covered another war \u2014 the war in Iraq.
p12
aVI was placed at the center of that war
p13
aVbecause I was covering the war
p14
aVfrom the northern part of Iraq.
p15
aVAnd the war ended
p16
aVwith a regime change,
p17
aVlike the one in Afghanistan.
p18
aVAnd that regime
p19
aVthat we got rid of
p20
aVwas actually a dictatorship,
p21
aVan authoritarian regime,
p22
aVthat for decades
p23
aVcreated a great sense of paralysis
p24
aVwithin the nation, within the people themselves.
p25
aVHowever,
p26
aVthe change that came through foreign intervention
p27
aVcreated even worse circumstances for the people
p28
aVand deepened the sense
p29
aVof paralysis and inferiority
p30
aVin that part of the world.
p31
aa(lp32
VFor decades,
p33
aVwe have lived under authoritarian regimes \u2014
p34
aVin the Arab world, in the Middle East.
p35
aVThese regimes
p36
aVcreated something within us during this period.
p37
aVI'm 43 years old right now.
p38
aVFor the last 40 years,
p39
aVI have seen almost the same faces
p40
aVfor kings and presidents ruling us \u2014
p41
aVold, aged, authoritarian,
p42
aVcorrupt situations \u2014
p43
aVregimes that we have seen around us.
p44
aVAnd for a moment I was wondering,
p45
aVare we going to live in order to see
p46
aVreal change happening on the ground,
p47
aVa change that does not come through foreign intervention,
p48
aVthrough the misery of occupation,
p49
aVthrough nations invading our land
p50
aVand deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?
p51
aVThe Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein,
p52
aVbut when they saw
p53
aVtheir land occupied by foreign forces
p54
aVthey felt very sad,
p55
aVthey felt that their dignity had suffered.
p56
aVAnd this is why they revolted.
p57
aVThis is why they did not accept.
p58
aVAnd actually other regimes, they told their citizens,
p59
aV"Would you like to see the situation of Iraq?
p60
aVWould you like to see civil war, sectarian killing?
p61
aVWould you like to see destruction?
p62
aVWould you like to see foreign troops on your land?"
p63
aVAnd the people thought for themselves,
p64
aV"Maybe we should live with
p65
aVthis kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in,
p66
aVinstead of having the second scenario."
p67
aVThat was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.
p68
aa(lp69
VFor 10 years,
p70
aVunfortunately we have found ourselves
p71
aVreporting images of destruction,
p72
aVimages of killing,
p73
aVof sectarian conflicts,
p74
aVimages of violence,
p75
aVemerging from a magnificent piece of land,
p76
aVa region that one day was the source
p77
aVof civilizations and art and culture
p78
aVfor thousands of years.
p79
aVNow I am here to tell you
p80
aVthat the future
p81
aVthat we were dreaming for
p82
aVhas eventually arrived.
p83
aVA new generation,
p84
aVwell-educated,
p85
aVconnected,
p86
aVinspired by universal values
p87
aVand a global understanding,
p88
aVhas created a new reality for us.
p89
aVWe have found a new way
p90
aVto express our feelings
p91
aVand to express our dreams:
p92
aVthese young people
p93
aVwho have restored self-confidence
p94
aVin our nations in that part of the world,
p95
aVwho have given us
p96
aVnew meaning for freedom
p97
aVand empowered us to go down to the streets.
p98
aVNothing happened. No violence. Nothing.
p99
aVJust step out of your house,
p100
aVraise your voice
p101
aVand say, "We would like to see the end of the regime."
p102
aa(lp103
VThis is what happened in Tunisia.
p104
aVOver a few days,
p105
aVthe Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars
p106
aVin the security agencies,
p107
aVbillions of dollars
p108
aVin maintaining, trying to maintain,
p109
aVits prisons,
p110
aVcollapsed, disappeared,
p111
aVbecause of the voices of the public.
p112
aVPeople who were inspired to go down to the streets
p113
aVand to raise their voices,
p114
aVthey tried to kill.
p115
aVThe intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.
p116
aVThey found something called Facebook.
p117
aVThey found something called Twitter.
p118
aVThey were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.
p119
aVAnd they said,
p120
aV"These kids are misled."
p121
aVTherefore, they asked their parents
p122
aVto go down to the streets
p123
aVand collect them, bring them back home.
p124
aVThis is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.
p125
aV"Bring these kids home
p126
aVbecause they are misled."
p127
aVBut yes,
p128
aVthese youth
p129
aVwho have been inspired
p130
aVby universal values,
p131
aVwho are idealistic enough
p132
aVto imagine a magnificent future
p133
aVand, at the same time, realistic enough
p134
aVto balance this kind of imagination
p135
aVand the process leading to it \u2014
p136
aVnot using violence,
p137
aVnot trying to create chaos \u2014
p138
aVthese young people,
p139
aVthey did not go home.
p140
aVParents actually went to the streets
p141
aVand they supported them.
p142
aVAnd this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.
p143
aa(lp144
VWe in Al Jazeera
p145
aVwere banned from Tunisia for years,
p146
aVand the government did not allow
p147
aVany Al Jazeera reporter to be there.
p148
aVBut we found that these people in the street,
p149
aVall of them are our reporters,
p150
aVfeeding our newsroom
p151
aVwith pictures, with videos
p152
aVand with news.
p153
aVAnd suddenly that newsroom in Doha
p154
aVbecame a center
p155
aVthat received all this kind of input from ordinary people \u2014
p156
aVpeople who are connected and people who have ambition
p157
aVand who have liberated themselves
p158
aVfrom the feeling of inferiority.
p159
aVAnd then we took that decision:
p160
aVWe are unrolling the news.
p161
aVWe are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.
p162
aVWe are going to spread the message.
p163
aVYes, some of these young people
p164
aVare connected to the Internet,
p165
aVbut the connectivity in the Arab world
p166
aVis very little, is very small,
p167
aVbecause of many problems that we are suffering from.
p168
aVBut Al Jazeera took the voice from these people
p169
aVand we amplified [it].
p170
aVWe put it in every sitting room in the Arab world \u2014
p171
aVand internationally, globally,
p172
aVthrough our English channel.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd then people started to feel
p175
aVthat there's something new happening.
p176
aVAnd then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali
p177
aVdecided to leave.
p178
aVAnd then Egypt started,
p179
aVand Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.
p180
aVAnd now Libya as you see it.
p181
aVAnd then you have Yemen.
p182
aVAnd you have many other countries trying to see
p183
aVand to rediscover that feeling
p184
aVof, "How do we imagine a future
p185
aVwhich is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?"
p186
aVI want to tell you something,
p187
aVthat the Internet and connectivity
p188
aVhas created [a] new mindset.
p189
aVBut this mindset
p190
aVhas continued to be faithful
p191
aVto the soil and to the land
p192
aVthat it emerged from.
p193
aVAnd while this was the major difference
p194
aVbetween many initiatives before
p195
aVto create change,
p196
aVbefore we thought, and governments told us \u2014
p197
aVand even sometimes it was true \u2014
p198
aVthat change was imposed on us,
p199
aVand people rejected that,
p200
aVbecause they thought that it is alien to their culture.
p201
aVAlways, we believed
p202
aVthat change will spring from within,
p203
aVthat change should be a reconciliation
p204
aVwith culture, cultural diversity,
p205
aVwith our faith in our tradition
p206
aVand in our history,
p207
aVbut at the same time,
p208
aVopen to universal values, connected with the world,
p209
aVtolerant to the outside.
p210
aVAnd this is the moment
p211
aVthat is happening right now in the Arab world.
p212
aVThis is the right moment, and this is the actual moment
p213
aVthat we see all of these meanings meet together
p214
aVand then create the beginning
p215
aVof this magnificent era
p216
aVthat will emerge from the region.
p217
aa(lp218
VHow did the elite deal with that \u2014
p219
aVthe so-called political elite?
p220
aVIn front of Facebook,
p221
aVthey brought the camels in Tahrir Square.
p222
aVIn front of Al Jazeera,
p223
aVthey started creating tribalism.
p224
aVAnd then when they failed,
p225
aVthey started speaking about conspiracies
p226
aVthat emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington
p227
aVin order to divide the Arab world.
p228
aVThey started telling the West,
p229
aV"Be aware of Al-Qaeda.
p230
aVAl-Qaeda is taking over our territories.
p231
aVThese are Islamists
p232
aVtrying to create new Imaras.
p233
aVBe aware of these people
p234
aVwho [are] coming to you
p235
aVin order to ruin your great civilization."
p236
aVFortunately,
p237
aVpeople right now cannot be deceived.
p238
aVBecause this corrupt elite
p239
aVin that region
p240
aVhas lost even the power of deception.
p241
aVThey could not, and they cannot, imagine
p242
aVhow they could really deal with this reality.
p243
aVThey have lost.
p244
aVThey have been detached
p245
aVfrom their people, from the masses,
p246
aVand now we are seeing them collapsing
p247
aVone after the other.
p248
aa(lp249
VAl Jazeera is not
p250
aVa tool of revolution.
p251
aVWe do not create revolutions.
p252
aVHowever,
p253
aVwhen something of that magnitude happens,
p254
aVwe are at the center of the coverage.
p255
aVWe were banned from Egypt,
p256
aVand our correspondents,
p257
aVsome of them were arrested.
p258
aVBut most of our camera people
p259
aVand our journalists,
p260
aVthey went underground in Egypt \u2014 voluntarily \u2014
p261
aVto report what happened in Tahrir Square.
p262
aVFor 18 days,
p263
aVour cameras were broadcasting, live,
p264
aVthe voices of the people in Tahrir Square.
p265
aVI remember one night
p266
aVwhen someone phoned me on my cellphone \u2014
p267
aVordinary person who I don't know \u2014 from Tahrir Square.
p268
aVHe told me, "We appeal to you
p269
aVnot to switch off the cameras.
p270
aVIf you switch off the cameras tonight,
p271
aVthere will be a genocide.
p272
aVYou are protecting us
p273
aVby showing what is happening at Tahrir Square."
p274
aVI felt the responsibility
p275
aVto phone our correspondents there
p276
aVand to phone our newsroom
p277
aVand to tell them, "Make your best
p278
aVnot to switch off the cameras at night,
p279
aVbecause the guys there really feel confident
p280
aVwhen someone is reporting their story \u2014
p281
aVand they feel protected as well."
p282
aa(lp283
VSo we have a chance
p284
aVto create a new future
p285
aVin that part of the world.
p286
aVWe have a chance
p287
aVto go and to think of the future
p288
aVas something which is open to the world.
p289
aVLet us not repeat the mistake of Iran,
p290
aVof [the] Mosaddeq revolution.
p291
aVLet us free ourselves \u2014 especially in the West \u2014
p292
aVfrom thinking about that part of the world
p293
aVbased on oil interest,
p294
aVor based on interests
p295
aVof the illusion of stability and security.
p296
aVThe stability and security
p297
aVof authoritarian regimes
p298
aVcannot create
p299
aVbut terrorism and violence and destruction.
p300
aVLet us accept the choice of the people.
p301
aVLet us not pick and choose
p302
aVwho we would like to rule their future.
p303
aVThe future should be ruled
p304
aVby people themselves,
p305
aVeven sometimes if they are voices
p306
aVthat might now scare us.
p307
aVBut the values of democracy
p308
aVand the freedom of choice
p309
aVthat is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time
p310
aVis the best opportunity for the world,
p311
aVfor the West and the East,
p312
aVto see stability and to see security
p313
aVand to see friendship and to see tolerance
p314
aVemerging from the Arab world,
p315
aVrather than the images of violence and terrorism.
p316
aVLet us support these people.
p317
aVLet us stand for them.
p318
aVAnd let us give up
p319
aVour narrow selfishness
p320
aVin order to embrace change,
p321
aVand in order to celebrate with the people of that region
p322
aVa great future
p323
aVand hope and tolerance.
p324
aVThe future has arrived,
p325
aVand the future is now.
p326
aVI thank you very much.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
VThank you very much.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Applause)
p333
aa(lp334
VChris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you.
p335
aVThank you for coming here.
p336
aVHow would you characterize the historical significance
p337
aVof what's happened?
p338
aVIs this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade
p339
aVor something more?
p340
aa(lp341
VWadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.
p342
aVWe have covered many wars.
p343
aVWe have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems,
p344
aVa lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region,
p345
aVbecause we were centered at the middle of it.
p346
aVBut this is a story \u2014 it is a great story; it is beautiful.
p347
aVIt is not something that you only cover
p348
aVbecause you have to cover a great incident.
p349
aVYou are witnessing change in history.
p350
aVYou are witnessing the birth of a new era.
p351
aVAnd this is what the story's all about.
p352
aa(lp353
VCA: There are a lot of people in the West
p354
aVwho are still skeptical,
p355
aVor think this may just be an intermediate stage
p356
aVbefore much more alarming chaos.
p357
aVYou really believe
p358
aVthat if there are democratic elections in Egypt now,
p359
aVthat a government could emerge
p360
aVthat espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?
p361
aa(lp362
VWK: And people actually,
p363
aVafter the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime,
p364
aVthe youth who have organized themselves
p365
aVin certain groups and councils,
p366
aVthey are guarding the transformation
p367
aVand they are trying to put it on a track
p368
aVin order to satisfy
p369
aVthe values of democracy,
p370
aVbut at the same time
p371
aValso to make it reasonable
p372
aVand to make it rational,
p373
aVnot to go out of order.
p374
aVIn my opinion, these people are much more wiser
p375
aVthan, not only the political elite,
p376
aVeven the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders
p377
aVincluding political parties.
p378
aVAt this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world
p379
aVare much more wiser
p380
aVand capable of creating the change
p381
aVthan the old \u2014
p382
aVincluding the political and cultural
p383
aVand ideological
p384
aVold regimes.
p385
aa(lp386
V(Applause)
p387
aa(lp388
VCA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way.
p389
aVWhat should people here at TED,
p390
aVhere in the West,
p391
aVdo if they want to connect or make a difference
p392
aVand they believe in what's happening here?
p393
aa(lp394
VWK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world \u2014
p395
aVthat people care,
p396
aVpeople care about this great transformation.
p397
aVMohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us,
p398
aVthe head of Aljazeera.net,
p399
aVhe told me that a 2,500 percent increase
p400
aVof accessing our website
p401
aVfrom various parts of the world.
p402
aVFifty percent of it is coming from America.
p403
aVBecause we discovered that people care,
p404
aVand people would like to know \u2014
p405
aVthey are receiving the stream through our Internet.
p406
aVUnfortunately in the United States,
p407
aVwe are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time
p408
aVfor Al Jazeera English.
p409
aVBut I can tell you, this is the moment to celebrate
p410
aVthrough connecting ourselves
p411
aVwith those people in the street
p412
aVand expressing our support to them
p413
aVand expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling,
p414
aVof supporting the weak and the oppressed
p415
aVto create a much better future for all of us.
p416
aa(lp417
VCA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community,
p418
aVTEDxCairo,
p419
aVare meeting as we speak.
p420
aVThey've had some speakers there.
p421
aVI believe they've heard your talk.

VIt was April 8, 2003.
p5
aVI was in Baghdad, covering the war in Iraq.
p6
aVThat day, Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad.
p7
aVWe were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel,
p8
aVand, as happens in war,
p9
aVthe fighting began to approach outside our windows.
p10
aVBaghdad was covered in black smoke and oil.
p11
aVIt smelled awful.
p12
aVWe couldn't see a thing, but we knew what was happening.
p13
aa(lp14
VOf course, I was supposed to be writing an article,
p15
aVbut that's how it always goes \u2014
p16
aVyou're supposed to be writing and something big happens.
p17
aVSo I was in my room on the 16th floor,
p18
aVwriting and looking out the window every now and then
p19
aVto see what was happening.
p20
aVSuddenly, there was a huge explosion.
p21
aVDuring the previous three weeks,
p22
aVthere had been shelling with half-ton missiles,
p23
aVbut this time, the shock \u2014
p24
aVI felt it inside of me,
p25
aVand I thought, "It's very close.
p26
aVIt's very, very close."
p27
aa(lp28
VSo I went down to see what was happening.
p29
aVI went down to the 15th floor
p30
aVto take a look.
p31
aVAnd I saw people, journalists, screaming in the hallways.
p32
aVI walked into a room
p33
aVand realized that it had been hit by a missile.
p34
aVSomeone had been wounded.
p35
aVThere was a man near the window,
p36
aVa cameraman named Taras Protsyuk,
p37
aVlying face-down.
p38
aVHaving worked in a hospital before, I wanted to help out.
p39
aVSo I turned him over.
p40
aVAnd when I turned him over,
p41
aVI noticed that he was open from sternum to pubis,
p42
aVbut I couldn't see anything, nothing at all.
p43
aVAll I saw was a white, pearly, shiny spot that blinded me,
p44
aVand I didn't understand what was going on.
p45
aa(lp46
VOnce the spot disappeared and I could see his wound,
p47
aVwhich was very serious,
p48
aVmy buddies and I put a sheet underneath him,
p49
aVand we carried him onto an elevator that stopped at each of the 15 floors.
p50
aVWe put him in a car that took him to the hospital.
p51
aVHe died on the way to the hospital.
p52
aVThe Spanish cameraman José Couso, who was on the 14th floor and also hit \u2014
p53
aVbecause the shell had exploded between the two floors \u2014
p54
aVdied on the operating table.
p55
aVAs soon as the car left, I went back.
p56
aVThere was that article I was supposed to write \u2014
p57
aVwhich I had to write.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd so \u2014
p60
aVI returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood,
p61
aVwhen one of the hotel gofers stopped me
p62
aVand asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for 10 days.
p63
aVI told him to get lost.
p64
aVAnd I said to myself: "Clear your head, put it all aside.
p65
aVIf you want to write, you need to put it all aside."
p66
aVAnd that's what I did.
p67
aVI went upstairs, wrote my article and sent it off.
p68
aa(lp69
VLater, aside from the feeling of having lost my colleagues,
p70
aVsomething else was bothering me.
p71
aVI kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot,
p72
aVand I couldn't understand what it meant.
p73
aVAnd then, the war was over.
p74
aa(lp75
VLater, I thought: "That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened."
p76
aVBecause it wasn't the first time, and it didn't only happen to me.
p77
aVI have seen things like that happen to others
p78
aVin my 20 to 35 years of reporting.
p79
aVI have seen things that had an effect on me too.
p80
aVFor example, there was this man I knew in Lebanon,
p81
aVa 25-year-old veteran who had been fighting for five years \u2014
p82
aVa real veteran \u2014 who we would follow everywhere.
p83
aVHe would crawl in the dark with confidence \u2014
p84
aVhe was a great soldier, a true soldier \u2014
p85
aVso we would follow him, knowing that we would be safe with him.
p86
aVAnd one day, as I was told \u2014
p87
aVand I've seen him again since \u2014
p88
aVhe was back in the camp, playing cards,
p89
aVwhen someone came in next door,
p90
aVand discharged their weapon.
p91
aVAs the gun went off,
p92
aVthat blast, that one shot, made him duck quickly under the table,
p93
aVlike a child.
p94
aVHe was shaking, panicking.
p95
aVAnd since then, he has never been able to get up and fight.
p96
aVHe ended up working as a croupier
p97
aVin a Beirut casino where I later found him,
p98
aVbecause he couldn't sleep, so it was quite a suitable job.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo I thought to myself,
p101
aV"What is this thing that can kill you
p102
aVwithout leaving any visible scars?
p103
aVHow does that happen?
p104
aVWhat is this unknown thing?"
p105
aVIt was too common to be coincidental.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo I started to investigate \u2014
p108
aVthat's all I know how to do.
p109
aVI started to investigate
p110
aVby looking through books,
p111
aVreaching out to psychiatrists,
p112
aVgoing to museums, libraries, etc.
p113
aVFinally, I discovered that some people knew about this \u2014
p114
aVoften military psychiatrists \u2014
p115
aVand that what we were dealing with was called trauma.
p116
aVAmericans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis.
p117
aVIt was something
p118
aVthat existed,
p119
aVbut that we never spoke about.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo, this trauma \u2014
p122
aVwhat is it?
p123
aVWell, it's an encounter with death.
p124
aVI don't know if you've ever had an experience with death \u2014
p125
aVI'm not talking about dead bodies,
p126
aVor someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed,
p127
aVor someone who got hit by a car.
p128
aVI'm talking about facing the void of death.
p129
aVAnd that is something no one is supposed to see.
p130
aVPeople used to say,
p131
aV"Neither the sun, nor death can be looked at with a steady eye."
p132
aVA human being should not have to face the void of death.
p133
aa(lp134
VBut when that happens,
p135
aVit can remain invisible for a while \u2014
p136
aVdays, weeks, months, sometimes years.
p137
aVAnd then, at some point,
p138
aVit explodes,
p139
aVbecause it's something that has entered your brain \u2014
p140
aVa sort of window between an image and your mind \u2014
p141
aVthat has penetrated your brain,
p142
aVstaying there and taking up all the space inside.
p143
aVAnd there are people \u2014 men, women,
p144
aVwho suddenly no longer sleep.
p145
aVAnd they experience horrible anxiety attacks \u2014
p146
aVpanic attacks, not just minor fears.
p147
aVThey suddenly don't want to sleep,
p148
aVbecause when they do, they have the same nightmare every night.
p149
aVThey see the same image every night.
p150
aVWhat type of image?
p151
aVFor example, a soldier who enters a building
p152
aVand comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him.
p153
aVHe looks at the gun, straight down the barrel.
p154
aVAnd this barrel suddenly becomes enormous, deformed.
p155
aVIt becomes fluffy, swallowing everything.
p156
aVAnd he says \u2014
p157
aVlater he will say, "I saw death.
p158
aVI saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead."
p159
aVAnd from then on, he knows he is dead.
p160
aVIt is not a perception \u2014 he is convinced that he is dead.
p161
aVIn reality, someone came in, the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever,
p162
aVand he didn't actually get shot \u2014
p163
aVbut to him, he died in that moment.
p164
aVOr it can be the smell of a mass grave \u2014
p165
aVI saw a lot of that in Rwanda.
p166
aVIt can be the voice of a friend calling,
p167
aVand they're being slaughtered and there's nothing you can do.
p168
aVYou hear that voice,
p169
aVand you wake up every night \u2014 for weeks, months \u2014
p170
aVin a trance-like state, anxious and terrified,
p171
aVlike a child.
p172
aVI have seen men cry \u2014
p173
aVjust like children \u2014
p174
aVfrom seeing the same image.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo having that image of horror in your brain,
p177
aVseeing the void of death \u2014
p178
aVthat analogue of horror which is hiding something \u2014
p179
aVwill completely take over.
p180
aVYou cannot do anything, anything at all.
p181
aVYou cannot work anymore,
p182
aVyou cannot love anymore.
p183
aVYou go home and don't recognize anyone.
p184
aVYou don't even recognize yourself.
p185
aVYou hide and don't leave the house, you lock yourself in, you become ill.
p186
aVI know people who placed small cans outside their house with coins inside,
p187
aVin case someone tried to get in.
p188
aVAll of a sudden, you feel like you want to die or kill
p189
aVor hide or run away.
p190
aVYou want to be loved, but you hate everyone.
p191
aVIt's a feeling that seizes you entirely
p192
aVday in and day out,
p193
aVand you suffer tremendously.
p194
aVAnd no one understands.
p195
aVThey say, "There's nothing wrong with you. You seem fine, you have no injuries.
p196
aVYou went to war, came back; you're fine."
p197
aVThese people suffer tremendously.
p198
aVSome commit suicide.
p199
aVAfter all, suicide is like updating your daily planner \u2014
p200
aVI'm already dead, I might as well commit suicide.
p201
aVPlus, there is no more pain.
p202
aVSome commit suicide, others end up under the bridge, drinking.
p203
aVEveryone remembers that grandfather or uncle or neighbor
p204
aVwho used to drink, never said a word,
p205
aValways in a bad mood, beat his wife
p206
aVand who would end up either sinking into alcoholism or dying.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd why do we not talk about this?
p209
aVWe don't talk about it because it's taboo.
p210
aVIt's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death.
p211
aVBut others don't want hear it.
p212
aVThe first time I returned from an assignment,
p213
aVThey said, "Oh! He's back."
p214
aVThere was a fancy dinner \u2014 white tablecloth, candles, guests.
p215
aV"Tell us everything!"
p216
aVWhich I did.
p217
aVAfter 20 minutes, people were giving me dirty looks,
p218
aVthe hostess had her nose in the ashtray.
p219
aVIt was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening.
p220
aVSo I don't talk about it anymore.
p221
aVWe're just not ready to listen.
p222
aVPeople say outright: "Please, stop."
p223
aa(lp224
VIs that a rare occurrence?
p225
aVNo, it's extremely common.
p226
aVOne third of the soldiers who died in Iraq \u2014
p227
aVwell, not "died," let me re-phrase that \u2014
p228
aVone third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq
p229
aVsuffer from PTSD.
p230
aVIn 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War
p231
aVthat were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals.
p232
aVIn Vietnam, 54,000 people died \u2014
p233
aVAmericans.
p234
aVIn 1987, the US government identified 102,000 \u2014
p235
aVtwice as many \u2014
p236
aV102,000 veterans who died from committing suicide.
p237
aVTwice as many deaths by suicide than by combat in Vietnam.
p238
aVSo you see, this relates to everything,
p239
aVnot just modern warfare, but also ancient wars \u2014
p240
aVyou can read about it, the evidence is there.
p241
aVSo why do we not talk about it?
p242
aVWhy have we not talked about it?
p243
aVThe problem is that if you don't talk about it,
p244
aVyou're heading for disaster.
p245
aa(lp246
VThe only way to heal \u2014
p247
aVand the good news here is that this is treatable \u2014
p248
aVthink Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. \u2014
p249
aVit's indeed treatable.
p250
aVThe only way to heal from this trauma,
p251
aVfrom this encounter with death that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you
p252
aVis to find a way to express it.
p253
aa(lp254
VPeople used to say,
p255
aV"Language is the only thing that holds all of us together."
p256
aVWithout language, we're nothing.
p257
aVIt's the thing that makes us human.
p258
aVIn the face of such a horrible image \u2014
p259
aVa wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us \u2014
p260
aVthe only way to cope with it
p261
aVis to put human words to it.
p262
aVBecause these people feel excluded from humanity.
p263
aVNo one wants to see them anymore and they don't want to see anyone.
p264
aVThey feel dirty, defiled, ashamed.
p265
aVSomeone said, "Doctor, I don't use the subway anymore
p266
aVbecause I'm afraid people will see the horror in my eyes."
p267
aVAnother guy thought he had a terrible skin disease
p268
aVand spent six months with dermatologists, going from doctor to doctor.
p269
aVAnd then one day, they sent him to a psychiatrist.
p270
aVDuring his second session, he told the psychiatrist
p271
aVhe had a terrible skin disease from head to toe.
p272
aVThe psychiatrist asked, "Why are you in this state?"
p273
aVAnd the man said, "Well, because I'm dead, so I must be rotting away."
p274
aa(lp275
VSo you see this is something that has a profound effect on people.
p276
aVIn order to heal, we need to talk about it.
p277
aVThe horror needs to be put into words \u2014
p278
aVhuman words, so we can organize it and talk about it again.
p279
aVWe have to look death in the face.
p280
aVAnd if we can do that, if we can talk about these things,
p281
aVthen step by step, by working it out verbally,
p282
aVwe can reclaim our place in humanity.
p283
aVAnd it is important.
p284
aVSilence kills us.
p285
aa(lp286
VSo what does this mean?
p287
aVIt means that after a trauma,
p288
aVwithout question, we lose our "unbearable lightness of being,"
p289
aVthat sense of immortality that keeps us here \u2014
p290
aVmeaning, if we're here, we almost feel like we're immortal, which we're not,
p291
aVbut if we didn't believe that, we'd say, "What's the point of it all?"
p292
aVBut trauma survivors have lost that feeling of immortality.
p293
aVThey've lost their lightness.
p294
aVBut they have found something else.
p295
aVSo this means that if we manage to look death in the face,
p296
aVand actually confront it, rather than keep quiet and hide,
p297
aVlike some of the men or women I know did,
p298
aVsuch as Michael from Rwanda, Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo
p299
aVand other people I know,
p300
aVlike Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer,
p301
aVwho gave up field assignments after a trauma.
p302
aVFive friends of mine committed suicide,
p303
aVthey're the ones who did not survive the trauma.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo if we can look death in the face,
p306
aVif we, mortal humans, human mortals,
p307
aVunderstand that we are human and mortal, mortal and human,
p308
aVif we can confront death and identify it once again
p309
aVas the most mysterious place of all mysterious places,
p310
aVsince no one has ever seen it \u2014
p311
aVif we can give it back this meaning,
p312
aVyes, we may die,
p313
aVsurvive
p314
aVand come back to life,
p315
aVbut we'll come back stronger than before.
p316
aVMuch stronger.
p317
aa(lp318
VThank you.
p319

VBecause I usually take the role
p5
aVof trying to explain to people
p6
aVhow wonderful the new technologies
p7
aVthat are coming along are going to be,
p8
aVand I thought that, since I was among friends here,
p9
aVI would tell you what I really think
p10
aVand try to look back and try to understand
p11
aVwhat is really going on here
p12
aVwith these amazing jumps in technology
p13
aVthat seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I'm going to start out
p16
aVby showing just one very boring technology slide.
p17
aVAnd then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.
p18
aVThis is just a random slide
p19
aVthat I picked out of my file.
p20
aVWhat I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide,
p21
aVbut the general form of it.
p22
aVThis happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing
p23
aVabout the power of RISC microprocessors
p24
aVversus the power of local area networks.
p25
aVAnd the interesting thing about it
p26
aVis that this slide,
p27
aVlike so many technology slides that we're used to,
p28
aVis a sort of a straight line
p29
aVon a semi-log curve.
p30
aVIn other words, every step here
p31
aVrepresents an order of magnitude
p32
aVin performance scale.
p33
aVAnd this is a new thing
p34
aVthat we talk about technology
p35
aVon semi-log curves.
p36
aVSomething really weird is going on here.
p37
aVAnd that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo, if you could bring up the lights.
p40
aVIf you could bring up the lights higher,
p41
aVbecause I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.
p42
aVNow why do we draw technology curves
p43
aVin semi-log curves?
p44
aVWell the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve
p45
aVwhere, let's say, this is years,
p46
aVthis is time of some sort,
p47
aVand this is whatever measure of the technology
p48
aVthat I'm trying to graph,
p49
aVthe graphs look sort of silly.
p50
aVThey sort of go like this.
p51
aVAnd they don't tell us much.
p52
aVNow if I graph, for instance,
p53
aVsome other technology, say transportation technology,
p54
aVon a semi-log curve,
p55
aVit would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.
p56
aVBut when something like this happens,
p57
aVthings are qualitatively changing.
p58
aVSo if transportation technology
p59
aVwas moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,
p60
aVthen the day after tomorrow,
p61
aVI would be able to get in a taxi cab
p62
aVand be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
p63
aVIt's not moving like that.
p64
aVAnd there's nothing precedented
p65
aVin the history of technology development
p66
aVof this kind of self-feeding growth
p67
aVwhere you go by orders of magnitude every few years.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow the question that I'd like to ask is,
p70
aVif you look at these exponential curves,
p71
aVthey don't go on forever.
p72
aVThings just can't possibly keep changing
p73
aVas fast as they are.
p74
aVOne of two things is going to happen.
p75
aVEither it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,
p76
aVuntil something totally different comes along,
p77
aVor maybe it's going to do this.
p78
aVThat's about all it can do.
p79
aVNow I'm an optimist,
p80
aVso I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.
p81
aVIf so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now
p82
aVis a transition.
p83
aVWe're sort of on this line
p84
aVin a transition from the way the world used to be
p85
aVto some new way that the world is.
p86
aVAnd so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,
p87
aVis what's this new way that the world is?
p88
aVWhat's that new state that the world is heading toward?
p89
aVBecause the transition seems very, very confusing
p90
aVwhen we're right in the middle of it.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow when I was a kid growing up,
p93
aVthe future was kind of the year 2000,
p94
aVand people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
p95
aVNow here's a conference
p96
aVin which people talk about the future,
p97
aVand you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.
p98
aVIt's about as far as we go out.
p99
aVSo in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking
p100
aVone year per year
p101
aVfor my whole lifetime.
p102
aVNow I think that the reason
p103
aVis because we all feel
p104
aVthat something's happening there.
p105
aVThat transition is happening. We can all sense it.
p106
aVAnd we know that it just doesn't make too much sense
p107
aVto think out 30, 50 years
p108
aVbecause everything's going to be so different
p109
aVthat a simple extrapolation of what we're doing
p110
aVjust doesn't make any sense at all.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo what I would like to talk about
p113
aVis what that could be,
p114
aVwhat that transition could be that we're going through.
p115
aVNow in order to do that
p116
aVI'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff
p117
aVthat really has nothing to do
p118
aVwith technology and computers.
p119
aVBecause I think the only way to understand this
p120
aVis to really step back
p121
aVand take a long time scale look at things.
p122
aVSo the time scale that I would like to look at this on
p123
aVis the time scale of life on Earth.
p124
aVSo I think this picture makes sense
p125
aVif you look at it a few billion years at a time.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo if you go back
p128
aVabout two and a half billion years,
p129
aVthe Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock
p130
aVwith a lot of chemicals floating around on it.
p131
aVAnd if you look at the way
p132
aVthat the chemicals got organized,
p133
aVwe begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.
p134
aVAnd I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand
p135
aVabout how it started with RNA,
p136
aVbut I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,
p137
aVwhich is that, at that time,
p138
aVthere were little drops of oil floating around
p139
aVwith all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.
p140
aVAnd some of those drops of oil
p141
aVhad a particular combination of chemicals in them
p142
aVwhich caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside
p143
aVand grow the drops of oil.
p144
aVAnd those that were like that
p145
aVstarted to split and divide.
p146
aVAnd those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,
p147
aVthose little drops of oil.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,
p150
aVbecause every one of them
p151
aVwas a little random recipe of chemicals.
p152
aVAnd every time it divided,
p153
aVthey got sort of unequal division
p154
aVof the chemicals within them.
p155
aVAnd so every drop was a little bit different.
p156
aVIn fact, the drops that were different in a way
p157
aVthat caused them to be better
p158
aVat incorporating chemicals around them,
p159
aVgrew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.
p160
aVSo those tended to live longer,
p161
aVget expressed more.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow that's sort of just a very simple
p164
aVchemical form of life,
p165
aVbut when things got interesting
p166
aVwas when these drops
p167
aVlearned a trick about abstraction.
p168
aVSomehow by ways that we don't quite understand,
p169
aVthese little drops learned to write down information.
p170
aVThey learned to record the information
p171
aVthat was the recipe of the cell
p172
aVonto a particular kind of chemical
p173
aVcalled DNA.
p174
aVSo in other words, they worked out,
p175
aVin this mindless sort of evolutionary way,
p176
aVa form of writing that let them write down what they were,
p177
aVso that that way of writing it down could get copied.
p178
aVThe amazing thing is that that way of writing
p179
aVseems to have stayed steady
p180
aVsince it evolved two and a half billion years ago.
p181
aVIn fact the recipe for us, our genes,
p182
aVis exactly that same code and that same way of writing.
p183
aVIn fact, every living creature is written
p184
aVin exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
p185
aa(lp186
VIn fact, one of the things that I did
p187
aVjust for amusement purposes
p188
aVis we can now write things in this code.
p189
aVAnd I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,
p190
aVwhich I try not to let the security people see at airports.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVBut this has in it \u2014
p193
aVwhat I did is I took this code \u2014
p194
aVthe code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it \u2014
p195
aVand I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA
p196
aVand amplified it 10 to the 22 times.
p197
aVSo if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,
p198
aVI have plenty for everyone in the room,
p199
aVand, in fact, everyone in the world,
p200
aVand it's right here.
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aVIf I had really been a egotist,
p203
aVI would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VSo what was the next step?
p208
aVWriting down the DNA was an interesting step.
p209
aVAnd that caused these cells \u2014
p210
aVthat kept them happy for another billion years.
p211
aVBut then there was another really interesting step
p212
aVwhere things became completely different,
p213
aVwhich is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,
p214
aVso that they began to get communities of cells.
p215
aVI don't know if you know this,
p216
aVbut bacteria can actually exchange DNA.
p217
aVNow that's why, for instance,
p218
aVantibiotic resistance has evolved.
p219
aVSome bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,
p220
aVand it went around sort of creating its little DNA information
p221
aVwith other bacteria,
p222
aVand now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,
p223
aVbecause bacteria communicate.
p224
aVNow what this communication allowed
p225
aVwas communities to form
p226
aVthat, in some sense, were in the same boat together;
p227
aVthey were synergistic.
p228
aVSo they survived
p229
aVor they failed together,
p230
aVwhich means that if a community was very successful,
p231
aVall the individuals in that community
p232
aVwere repeated more
p233
aVand they were favored by evolution.
p234
aa(lp235
VNow the transition point happened
p236
aVwhen these communities got so close
p237
aVthat, in fact, they got together
p238
aVand decided to write down the whole recipe for the community
p239
aVtogether on one string of DNA.
p240
aVAnd so the next stage that's interesting in life
p241
aVtook about another billion years.
p242
aVAnd at that stage,
p243
aVwe have multi-cellular communities,
p244
aVcommunities of lots of different types of cells,
p245
aVworking together as a single organism.
p246
aVAnd in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.
p247
aVWe have lots of cells
p248
aVthat are not out for themselves anymore.
p249
aVYour skin cell is really useless
p250
aVwithout a heart cell, muscle cell,
p251
aVa brain cell and so on.
p252
aVSo these communities began to evolve
p253
aVso that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place
p254
aVwas no longer a cell,
p255
aVbut a community which we call an organism.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow the next step that happened
p258
aVis within these communities.
p259
aVThese communities of cells,
p260
aVagain, began to abstract information.
p261
aVAnd they began building very special structures
p262
aVthat did nothing but process information within the community.
p263
aVAnd those are the neural structures.
p264
aVSo neurons are the information processing apparatus
p265
aVthat those communities of cells built up.
p266
aVAnd in fact, they began to get specialists in the community
p267
aVand special structures
p268
aVthat were responsible for recording,
p269
aVunderstanding, learning information.
p270
aVAnd that was the brains and the nervous system
p271
aVof those communities.
p272
aVAnd that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
p273
aVBecause at that point,
p274
aVan individual \u2014
p275
aVlearning could happen
p276
aVwithin the time span of a single organism,
p277
aVinstead of over this evolutionary time span.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo an organism could, for instance,
p280
aVlearn not to eat a certain kind of fruit
p281
aVbecause it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.
p282
aVThat could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,
p283
aVwhereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,
p284
aVthat would have had to be learned evolutionarily
p285
aVover hundreds of thousands of years
p286
aVby the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.
p287
aVSo that nervous system,
p288
aVthe fact that they built these special information structures,
p289
aVtremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.
p290
aVBecause evolution could now happen within an individual.
p291
aVIt could happen in learning time scales.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut then what happened
p294
aVwas the individuals worked out,
p295
aVof course, tricks of communicating.
p296
aVAnd for example,
p297
aVthe most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.
p298
aVIt's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.
p299
aVHere I have a very complicated, messy,
p300
aVconfused idea in my head.
p301
aVI'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,
p302
aVand hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head
p303
aVthat bears some analogy to it.
p304
aVBut we're taking something very complicated,
p305
aVturning it into sound, sequences of sounds,
p306
aVand producing something very complicated in your brain.
p307
aVSo this allows us now
p308
aVto begin to start functioning
p309
aVas a single organism.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd so, in fact, what we've done
p312
aVis we, humanity,
p313
aVhave started abstracting out.
p314
aVWe're going through the same levels
p315
aVthat multi-cellular organisms have gone through \u2014
p316
aVabstracting out our methods of recording,
p317
aVpresenting, processing information.
p318
aVSo for example, the invention of language
p319
aVwas a tiny step in that direction.
p320
aVTelephony, computers,
p321
aVvideotapes, CD-ROMs and so on
p322
aVare all our specialized mechanisms
p323
aVthat we've now built within our society
p324
aVfor handling that information.
p325
aVAnd it all connects us together
p326
aVinto something
p327
aVthat is much bigger
p328
aVand much faster
p329
aVand able to evolve
p330
aVthan what we were before.
p331
aVSo now, evolution can take place
p332
aVon a scale of microseconds.
p333
aVAnd you saw Ty's little evolutionary example
p334
aVwhere he sort of did a little bit of evolution
p335
aVon the Convolution program right before your eyes.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo now we've speeded up the time scales once again.
p338
aVSo the first steps of the story that I told you about
p339
aVtook a billion years a piece.
p340
aVAnd the next steps,
p341
aVlike nervous systems and brains,
p342
aVtook a few hundred million years.
p343
aVThen the next steps, like language and so on,
p344
aVtook less than a million years.
p345
aVAnd these next steps, like electronics,
p346
aVseem to be taking only a few decades.
p347
aVThe process is feeding on itself
p348
aVand becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it \u2014
p349
aVwhen something reinforces its rate of change.
p350
aVThe more it changes, the faster it changes.
p351
aVAnd I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.
p352
aVWe're seeing this process feeding back on itself.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow I design computers for a living,
p355
aVand I know that the mechanisms
p356
aVthat I use to design computers
p357
aVwould be impossible
p358
aVwithout recent advances in computers.
p359
aVSo right now, what I do
p360
aVis I design objects at such complexity
p361
aVthat it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.
p362
aVI don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.
p363
aVThere are billions of them.
p364
aVInstead, what I do
p365
aVand what the designers at Thinking Machines do
p366
aVis we think at some level of abstraction
p367
aVand then we hand it to the machine
p368
aVand the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,
p369
aVmuch farther and faster than we could ever do.
p370
aVAnd in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods
p371
aVthat we don't quite even understand.
p372
aa(lp373
VOne method that's particularly interesting
p374
aVthat I've been using a lot lately
p375
aVis evolution itself.
p376
aVSo what we do
p377
aVis we put inside the machine
p378
aVa process of evolution
p379
aVthat takes place on the microsecond time scale.
p380
aVSo for example,
p381
aVin the most extreme cases,
p382
aVwe can actually evolve a program
p383
aVby starting out with random sequences of instructions.
p384
aVSay, "Computer, would you please make
p385
aVa hundred million random sequences of instructions.
p386
aVNow would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,
p387
aVrun all of those programs,
p388
aVand pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted."
p389
aVSo in other words, I define what I wanted.
p390
aVLet's say I want to sort numbers,
p391
aVas a simple example I've done it with.
p392
aVSo find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.
p393
aa(lp394
VSo of course, random sequences of instructions
p395
aVare very unlikely to sort numbers,
p396
aVso none of them will really do it.
p397
aVBut one of them, by luck,
p398
aVmay put two numbers in the right order.
p399
aVAnd I say, "Computer,
p400
aVwould you please now take the 10 percent
p401
aVof those random sequences that did the best job.
p402
aVSave those. Kill off the rest.
p403
aVAnd now let's reproduce
p404
aVthe ones that sorted numbers the best.
p405
aVAnd let's reproduce them by a process of recombination
p406
aVanalogous to sex."
p407
aVTake two programs and they produce children
p408
aVby exchanging their subroutines,
p409
aVand the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.
p410
aVSo I've got now a new generation of programs
p411
aVthat are produced by combinations
p412
aVof the programs that did a little bit better job.
p413
aVSay, "Please repeat that process."
p414
aVScore them again.
p415
aVIntroduce some mutations perhaps.
p416
aVAnd try that again and do that for another generation.
p417
aa(lp418
VWell every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.
p419
aVSo I can do the equivalent
p420
aVof millions of years of evolution on that
p421
aVwithin the computer in a few minutes,
p422
aVor in the complicated cases, in a few hours.
p423
aVAt the end of that, I end up with programs
p424
aVthat are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.
p425
aVIn fact, they are programs that are much more efficient
p426
aVthan programs I could have ever written by hand.
p427
aa(lp428
VNow if I look at those programs,
p429
aVI can't tell you how they work.
p430
aVI've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.
p431
aVThey're obscure, weird programs.
p432
aVBut they do the job.
p433
aVAnd in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job
p434
aVbecause they come from a line
p435
aVof hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.
p436
aVIn fact, their life depended on doing the job.
p437
aa(lp438
V(Laughter)
p439
aa(lp440
VI was riding in a 747
p441
aVwith Marvin Minsky once,
p442
aVand he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this.
p443
aVIt says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts
p444
aVworking together to make you a safe flight.'
p445
aVDoesn't that make you feel confident?"
p446
aa(lp447
V(Laughter)
p448
aa(lp449
VIn fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well
p450
aVwhen it gets complicated.
p451
aVSo we're beginning to depend on computers
p452
aVto do a process that's very different than engineering.
p453
aVAnd it lets us produce things of much more complexity
p454
aVthan normal engineering lets us produce.
p455
aVAnd yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.
p456
aVSo in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.
p457
aVWe're now using those programs
p458
aVto make much faster computers
p459
aVso that we'll be able to run this process much faster.
p460
aVSo it's feeding back on itself.
p461
aVThe thing is becoming faster
p462
aVand that's why I think it seems so confusing.
p463
aVBecause all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.
p464
aVWe're taking off.
p465
aa(lp466
VAnd what we are is we're at a point in time
p467
aVwhich is analogous to when single-celled organisms
p468
aVwere turning into multi-celled organisms.
p469

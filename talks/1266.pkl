VI'd like to start with a short story.
p5
aVIt's about a little boy
p6
aVwhose father was a history buff
p7
aVand who used to take him by the hand
p8
aVto visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis
p9
aVon the outskirts of their camp.
p10
aVThey would always stop by to visit
p11
aVthese huge winged bulls that used to guard
p12
aVthe gates of that ancient metropolis,
p13
aVand the boy used to be scared
p14
aVof these winged bulls,
p15
aVbut at the same time they excited him.
p16
aVAnd the dad used to use those bulls
p17
aVto tell the boy stories about
p18
aVthat civilization and their work.
p19
aa(lp20
VLet's fast-forward to the
p21
aVSan Francisco Bay Area many decades later,
p22
aVwhere I started a technology company
p23
aVthat brought the world its first
p24
aV3D laser scanning system.
p25
aVLet me show you how it works.
p26
aVFemale Voice: Long range laser scanning
p27
aVby sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light.
p28
aVThe system measures the beam's time of flight,
p29
aVrecording the time it takes for the light
p30
aVto hit a surface and make its return.
p31
aVWith two mirrors, the scanner calculates
p32
aVthe beam's horizontal and vertical angles,
p33
aVgiving accurate x, y, and z coordinates.
p34
aVThe point is then recorded
p35
aVinto a 3D visualization program.
p36
aVAll of this happens in seconds.
p37
aVBen Kacyra: You can see here,
p38
aVthese systems are extremely fast.
p39
aVThey collect millions of points at a time
p40
aVwith very high accuracy
p41
aVand very high resolution.
p42
aVA surveyor with traditional survey tools
p43
aVwould be hard-pressed to produce
p44
aVmaybe 500 points in a whole day.
p45
aVThese babies would be producing
p46
aVsomething like ten thousand points a second.
p47
aVSo, as you can imagine,
p48
aVthis was a paradigm shift
p49
aVin the survey and construction
p50
aVas well as in reality capture industry.
p51
aa(lp52
VApproximately ten years ago,
p53
aVmy wife and I started a foundation to do good,
p54
aVand right about that time,
p55
aVthe magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas,
p56
aVhundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan,
p57
aVwere blown up by the Taliban.
p58
aVThey were gone in an instant.
p59
aVAnd unfortunately, there was
p60
aVno detailed documentation of these Buddhas.
p61
aVThis clearly devastated me,
p62
aVand I couldn't help but wonder about
p63
aVthe fate of my old friends, the winged bulls,
p64
aVand the fate of the many, many
p65
aVheritage sites all over the world.
p66
aVBoth my wife and I
p67
aVwere so touched by this
p68
aVthat we decided to
p69
aVexpand the mission of our foundation
p70
aVto include digital heritage preservation
p71
aVof world sites.
p72
aVWe called the project CyArk,
p73
aVwhich stands for Cyber Archive.
p74
aa(lp75
VTo date, with the help of
p76
aVa global network of partners,
p77
aVwe've completed close to fifty projects.
p78
aVLet me show you some of them:
p79
aVChichen Itza,
p80
aVRapa Nui \u2014
p81
aVand what you're seeing here
p82
aVare the cloud of points \u2014
p83
aVBabylon,
p84
aVRosslyn Chapel,
p85
aVPompeii,
p86
aVand our latest project, Mt. Rushmore,
p87
aVwhich happened to be one of
p88
aVour most challenging projects.
p89
aVAs you see here, we had to develop
p90
aVa special rig to bring the scanner
p91
aVup close and personal.
p92
aVThe results of our work in the field
p93
aVare used to produce
p94
aVmedia and deliverables to be used
p95
aVby conservators and researchers.
p96
aVWe also produce media for
p97
aVdissemination to the public \u2014
p98
aVfree through the CyArk website.
p99
aVThese would be used for education,
p100
aVcultural tourism, etc.
p101
aa(lp102
VWhat you're looking at in here
p103
aVis a 3D viewer that we developed
p104
aVthat would allow the display
p105
aVand manipulation of [the] cloud of points
p106
aVin real time, cutting sections through them
p107
aVand extracting dimensions.
p108
aVThis happens to be the cloud of points
p109
aVfor Tikal.
p110
aVIn here you see a traditional 2D
p111
aVarchitectural engineering drawing
p112
aVthat's used for preservation, and of course
p113
aVwe tell the stories through fly-throughs.
p114
aVAnd here, this is a fly-through
p115
aVthe cloud of points of Tikal,
p116
aVand here you see it rendered
p117
aVand photo-textured with the photography
p118
aVthat we take of the site.
p119
aVAnd so this is not a video.
p120
aVThis is actual 3D points with
p121
aVtwo to three millimeter accuracy.
p122
aVAnd of course the data can be used
p123
aVto develop 3D models that are
p124
aVvery accurate and very detailed.
p125
aVAnd here you're looking at a model
p126
aVthat's extracted from the cloud of points
p127
aVfor Stirling Castle.
p128
aVIt's used for studies, for visualization,
p129
aVas well as for education.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd finally, we produce mobile apps
p132
aVthat include narrated virtual tools.
p133
aVThe more I got involved
p134
aVin the heritage field,
p135
aVthe more it became clear to me
p136
aVthat we are losing the sites
p137
aVand the stories faster than we can
p138
aVphysically preserve them.
p139
aVOf course, earthquakes
p140
aVand all the natural phenomena \u2014
p141
aVfloods, tornadoes, etc. \u2014
p142
aVtake their toll.
p143
aVHowever, what occurred to me was
p144
aVhuman-caused destruction, which was
p145
aVnot only causing a significant portion
p146
aVof the destruction, but actually
p147
aVit was accelerating.
p148
aVThis includes arson,
p149
aVurban sprawl,
p150
aVacid rain, not to mention
p151
aVterrorism and wars.
p152
aVIt was getting more and more apparent
p153
aVthat we're fighting a losing battle.
p154
aVWe're losing our sites
p155
aVand the stories,
p156
aVand basically we're losing
p157
aVa piece \u2014 and a significant piece \u2014
p158
aVof our collective memory.
p159
aVImagine us as a human race
p160
aVnot knowing where we came from.
p161
aa(lp162
VLuckily, in the last two or three decades,
p163
aVdigital technologies have been developing
p164
aVthat have helped us to develop tools
p165
aVthat we've brought to bear
p166
aVin the digital preservation,
p167
aVin our digital preservation war.
p168
aVThis includes, for example,
p169
aVthe 3D laser scanning systems,
p170
aVever more powerful personal computers,
p171
aV3D graphics,
p172
aVhigh-definition digital photography,
p173
aVnot to mention the Internet.
p174
aVBecause of this accelerated
p175
aVpace of destruction,
p176
aVit became clear to us that we needed
p177
aVto challenge ourselves and our partners
p178
aVto accelerate our work.
p179
aVAnd we created a project
p180
aVwe call the CyArk 500 Challenge \u2014
p181
aVand that is to digitally preserve
p182
aV500 World Heritage Sites
p183
aVin five years.
p184
aa(lp185
VWe do have the technology
p186
aVthat's scaleable,
p187
aVand our network of global partners
p188
aVhas been expanding and can be expanded
p189
aVat a rapid rate,
p190
aVso we're comfortable
p191
aVthat this task can be accomplished.
p192
aVHowever, to me, the 500 is
p193
aVreally just the first 500.
p194
aVIn order to sustain our work into the future,
p195
aVwe use technology centers
p196
aVwhere we partner with
p197
aVlocal universities and colleges
p198
aVto take the technology to them,
p199
aVwhereby they then can help us
p200
aVwith digital preservation of their heritage sites,
p201
aVand at the same time, it gives them
p202
aVthe technology to benefit from in the future.
p203
aa(lp204
VLet me close with another short story.
p205
aVTwo years ago, we were approached
p206
aVby a partner of ours to digitally preserve
p207
aVan important heritage site,
p208
aVa UNESCO heritage site in Uganda,
p209
aVthe Royal Kasubi Tombs.
p210
aVThe work was done successfully in the field,
p211
aVand the data was archived
p212
aVand publicly disseminated
p213
aVthrough the CyArk website.
p214
aVLast March,
p215
aVwe received very sad news.
p216
aVThe Royal Tombs had been destroyed
p217
aVby suspected arson.
p218
aVA few days later, we received a call:
p219
aV"Is the data available
p220
aVand can it be used for reconstruction?"
p221
aVOur answer, of course, was yes.
p222
aa(lp223
VLet me leave you with a final thought.
p224
aVOur heritage is much more than
p225
aVour collective memory \u2014
p226
aVit's our collective treasure.
p227
aVWe owe it to our children,
p228
aVour grandchildren and the generations
p229
aVwe will never meet
p230
aVto keep it safe
p231
aVand to pass it along.
p232
aVThank you.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Applause)
p235
aVThank you.
p236
aa(lp237
VThank you.
p238
aa(lp239
VThank you.
p240
aa(lp241
VWell, I'm staying here because
p242
aVwe wanted to demonstrate to you
p243
aVthe power of this technology
p244
aVand so, while I've been speaking,
p245
aVyou have been scanned.
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aVThe two wizards that I have
p248
aVthat are behind the curtain
p249
aVwill help me bring
p250
aVthe results on the screen.
p251
aV(Applause)
p252
aa(lp253
VThis is all in 3D and of course
p254
aVyou can fly through the cloud of points.
p255
aVYou can look at it from on top,
p256
aVfrom the ceiling.
p257
aVYou can look from different vantage points,
p258
aVbut I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in
p259
aVon an individual in the crowd,
p260
aVjust to show the amount of detail
p261
aVthat we can create.
p262
aVSo you have been digitally preserved
p263
aVin about four minutes.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VI'd like to thank the wizards here.
p267
aVWe were very lucky to have
p268
aVtwo of our partners participate in this:
p269
aVthe Historic Scotland,
p270
aVand the Glasgow School of Art.
p271
aVI'd like to also thank personally
p272
aVthe efforts of David Mitchell,
p273
aVwho is the Director of Conservation
p274
aVat Historic Scotland.
p275
aVDavid.
p276
aV(Applause)
p277
aVAnd Doug Pritchard, who's the Head of
p278
aVVisualization at the Glasgow School of Art.
p279
aVLet's give them a hand.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Applause)
p282
aa(lp283
VThank you.

Combined with high-definition photography and traditional surveying techniques these data make it possible to create highly detailed media &ndash; photo textured animations, 3D fly-throughs &ndash;&nbsp;that digitally preserve our knowledge of heritage sites against natural disaster, war, and neglect, and make them accessible to the world.

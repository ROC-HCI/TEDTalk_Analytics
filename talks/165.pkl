VSo, where are the robots?
p5
aVWe've been told for 40 years already that they're coming soon.
p6
aVVery soon they'll be doing everything for us.
p7
aVThey'll be cooking, cleaning, buying things, shopping, building. But they aren't here.
p8
aVMeanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work,
p9
aVbut we don't have any robots.
p10
aVSo what can we do about that? What can we say?
p11
aVSo I want to give a little bit of a different perspective
p12
aVof how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way.
p13
aVAnd this is an x-ray picture
p14
aVof a real beetle, and a Swiss watch, back from '88. You look at that \u2014
p15
aVwhat was true then is certainly true today.
p16
aVWe can still make the pieces. We can make the right pieces.
p17
aVWe can make the circuitry of the right computational power,
p18
aVbut we can't actually put them together to make something
p19
aVthat will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo let's try to look at it from a different perspective.
p22
aVLet's summon the best designer, the mother of all designers.
p23
aVLet's see what evolution can do for us.
p24
aVSo we threw in \u2014 we created a primordial soup
p25
aVwith lots of pieces of robots \u2014 with bars, with motors, with neurons.
p26
aVPut them all together, and put all this under kind of natural selection,
p27
aVunder mutation, and rewarded things for how well they can move forward.
p28
aVA very simple task, and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo if you look, you can see a lot of different machines
p31
aVcome out of this. They all move around.
p32
aVThey all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right,
p33
aVthat we actually made a couple of these things,
p34
aVand they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots,
p35
aVbut they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for:
p36
aa(lp37
Vfor moving forward. So that was all done in simulation,
p38
aVbut we can also do that on a real machine.
p39
aVHere's a physical robot that we actually
p40
aVhave a population of brains,
p41
aVcompeting, or evolving on the machine.
p42
aVIt's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine,
p43
aVand they get rewarded for how fast or how far
p44
aVthey can make the machine move forward.
p45
aVAnd you can see these robots are not ready
p46
aVto take over the world yet, but
p47
aVthey gradually learn how to move forward,
p48
aVand they do this autonomously.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo in these two examples, we had basically
p51
aVmachines that learned how to walk in simulation,
p52
aVand also machines that learned how to walk in reality.
p53
aVBut I want to show you a different approach,
p54
aVand this is this robot over here, which has four legs.
p55
aVIt has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.
p56
aVIt has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine
p57
aVwhich way it's tilting.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut this machine doesn't know what it looks like.
p60
aVYou look at it and you see it has four legs,
p61
aVthe machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree,
p62
aVit doesn't have any idea what it looks like,
p63
aVbut it's going to try to find that out.
p64
aVInitially, it does some random motion,
p65
aVand then it tries to figure out what it might look like.
p66
aVAnd you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds,
p67
aVa lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship
p68
aVbetween actuation and sensing. It then tries to do
p69
aVa second action that creates the most disagreement
p70
aVamong predictions of these alternative models,
p71
aVlike a scientist in a lab. Then it does that
p72
aVand tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models.
p73
aa(lp74
VThis is the last cycle, and you can see it's pretty much
p75
aVfigured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self-model,
p76
aVit can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion.
p77
aVSo what you're seeing here are a couple of machines \u2014
p78
aVa pattern of locomotion.
p79
aVWe were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk,
p80
aVbut instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut when you look at that, you have to remember
p83
aVthat this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward,
p84
aVnor did it have a model of itself.
p85
aVIt kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward,
p86
aVand then actually tried that out.
p87
aV(Applause)
p88
aa(lp89
VSo, we'll move forward to a different idea.
p90
aVSo that was what happened when we had a couple of \u2014
p91
aVthat's what happened when you had a couple of \u2014 OK, OK, OK \u2014
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aV\u2014 they don't like each other. So
p94
aVthere's a different robot.
p95
aVThat's what happened when the robots actually
p96
aVare rewarded for doing something.
p97
aVWhat happens if you don't reward them for anything, you just throw them in?
p98
aa(lp99
VSo we have these cubes, like the diagram showed here.
p100
aVThe cube can swivel, or flip on its side,
p101
aVand we just throw 1,000 of these cubes into a soup \u2014
p102
aVthis is in simulation \u2014and don't reward them for anything,
p103
aVwe just let them flip. We pump energy into this
p104
aVand see what happens in a couple of mutations.
p105
aVSo, initially nothing happens, they're just flipping around there.
p106
aVBut after a very short while, you can see these blue things
p107
aVon the right there begin to take over.
p108
aa(lp109
VThey begin to self-replicate. So in absence of any reward,
p110
aVthe intrinsic reward is self-replication.
p111
aVAnd we've actually built a couple of these,
p112
aVand this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes.
p113
aVIt's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually
p114
aVcarrying out some of its replication process.
p115
aVSo you're feeding it with more material \u2014 cubes in this case \u2014
p116
aVand more energy, and it can make another robot.
p117
aVSo of course, this is a very crude machine,
p118
aVbut we're working on a micro-scale version of these,
p119
aVand hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in.
p120
aa(lp121
VOK, so what can we learn? These robots are of course
p122
aVnot very useful in themselves, but they might teach us something
p123
aVabout how we can build better robots,
p124
aVand perhaps how humans, animals, create self-models and learn.
p125
aVAnd one of the things that I think is important
p126
aVis that we have to get away from this idea
p127
aVof designing the machines manually,
p128
aVbut actually let them evolve and learn, like children,
p129
aVand perhaps that's the way we'll get there. Thank you.

say that Hod Lipson and <a href=\\"http://ccsl.mae.cornell.edu/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">his team at Cornell</a>  build robots is not completely accurate: They may simply set out a pile of virtual robot parts, devise some rules for assembly, and see what the parts build themselves into. They&#39;ve created robots that decide for themselves how they want to walk; <strong>robots that develop a sense of what they look like</strong>; even robots that can, through trial and error, construct other robots just like themselves. </p><p>Working across disciplines -- <strong>physics, computer science, math, biology and several flavors of engineer</strong> -- the team studies techniques for self-assembly and evolution that have great implications for fields such as micro-manufacturing -- allowing tiny pieces to assemble themselves at scales heretofore impossible -- and extreme custom manufacturing (in other words, <a href=\\"http://www.fabathome.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">3-D printers</a>  for the home). </p><p>His lab&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ccsl.mae.cornell.edu/outreach/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Outreach</a>  page is a funhouse of tools and instructions, including the amazing <a href=\\"http://ccsl.mae.cornell.edu/outreach/golemathome.htm\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Golem@Home</a>  -- a self-assembling virtual robot who lives in your screensaver. </p>", "slug": "hod_lipson", "whotheyare": "Hod Lipson works at the intersection of engineering and biology, studying robots and the way they \\"behave\\" and evolve.

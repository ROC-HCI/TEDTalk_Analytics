VThis is the venue
p5
aVwhere, as a young man,
p6
aVsome of the music that I wrote was first performed.
p7
aVIt was, remarkably,
p8
aVa pretty good sounding room.
p9
aVWith all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere,
p10
aVit actually sounded pretty good.
p11
aVThis is a song that was recorded there.
p12
aV(Music)
p13
aVThis is not Talking Heads,
p14
aVin the picture anyway.
p15
aV(Music: "A Clean Break (Let's Work)" by Talking Heads)
p16
aVSo the nature of the room
p17
aVmeant that words could be understood.
p18
aVThe lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.
p19
aVThe sound system was kind of decent.
p20
aVAnd there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.
p21
aVSo the rhythms
p22
aVcould be pretty intact too,
p23
aVpretty concise.
p24
aVOther places around the country had similar rooms.
p25
aVThis is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.
p26
aVThe music was in some ways different,
p27
aVbut in structure and form,
p28
aVvery much the same.
p29
aVThe clientele behavior was very much the same too.
p30
aVAnd so the bands at Tootsie's
p31
aVor at CBGB's
p32
aVhad to play loud enough \u2014
p33
aVthe volume had to be loud enough to overcome
p34
aVpeople falling down, shouting out
p35
aVand doing whatever else they were doing.
p36
aa(lp37
VSince then, I've played other places
p38
aVthat are much nicer.
p39
aVI've played the Disney Hall here
p40
aVand Carnegie Hall and places like that.
p41
aVAnd it's been very exciting.
p42
aVBut I also noticed that sometimes the music
p43
aVthat I had written,
p44
aVor was writing at the time,
p45
aVdidn't sound all that great
p46
aVin some of those halls.
p47
aVWe managed,
p48
aVbut sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited
p49
aVto the music I was making
p50
aVor had made.
p51
aVSo I asked myself:
p52
aVDo I write stuff
p53
aVfor specific rooms?
p54
aVDo I have a place, a venue,
p55
aVin mind when I write?
p56
aVIs that a kind of model for creativity?
p57
aVDo we all make things with
p58
aVa venue, a context, in mind?
p59
aa(lp60
VOkay, Africa.
p61
aV(Music: "Wenlenga" / Various artists)
p62
aVMost of the popular music that we know now
p63
aVhas a big part of its roots in West Africa.
p64
aVAnd the music there,
p65
aVI would say, the instruments,
p66
aVthe intricate rhythms,
p67
aVthe way it's played, the setting, the context,
p68
aVit's all perfect. It all works perfect.
p69
aVThe music works perfectly in that setting.
p70
aVThere's no big room
p71
aVto create reverberation and confuse the rhythms.
p72
aVThe instruments are loud enough
p73
aVthat they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.
p74
aVIt's no accident.
p75
aVIt's perfect for that particular context.
p76
aVAnd it would be a mess
p77
aVin a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.
p78
aV(Music: "Spem In Alium" by Thomas Tallis)
p79
aVIn a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.
p80
aVIt doesn't change key, the notes are long,
p81
aVthere's almost no rhythm whatsoever,
p82
aVand the room flatters the music.
p83
aVIt actually improves it.
p84
aVThis is the room that Bach
p85
aVwrote some of his music for. This is the organ.
p86
aVIt's not as big as a gothic cathedral,
p87
aVso he can write things that are a little bit more intricate.
p88
aVHe can, very innovatively,
p89
aVactually change keys
p90
aVwithout risking huge dissonances.
p91
aV(Music: "Fantasia On Jesu, Mein Freunde" by Johann S. Bach)
p92
aa(lp93
VThis is a little bit later.
p94
aVThis is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.
p95
aVI think we're in like 1770, somewhere around there.
p96
aVThey're smaller, even less reverberant,
p97
aVso he can write really frilly music
p98
aVthat's very intricate \u2014 and it works.
p99
aV(Music: "Sonata in F," KV 13, by Wolfgang A. Mozart)
p100
aVIt fits the room perfectly.
p101
aVThis is La Scala.
p102
aVIt's around the same time,
p103
aVI think it was built around 1776.
p104
aVPeople in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built,
p105
aVthey used to yell out to one another.
p106
aVThey used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage,
p107
aVjust like they do at CBGB's and places like that.
p108
aVIf they liked an aria,
p109
aVthey would holler and suggest
p110
aVthat it be done again as an encore,
p111
aVnot at the end of the show, but immediately.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVAnd well, that was an opera experience.
p114
aVThis is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.
p115
aVAnd the size of the room is not that big.
p116
aVIt's smaller than this.
p117
aVBut Wagner made an innovation.
p118
aVHe wanted a bigger band.
p119
aVHe wanted a little more bombast,
p120
aVso he increased the size of the orchestra pit
p121
aVso he could get more low-end instruments in there.
p122
aV(Music: "Lohengrin / Prelude to Act III" by Richard Wagner)
p123
aa(lp124
VOkay.
p125
aVThis is Carnegie Hall.
p126
aVObviously, this kind of thing became popular.
p127
aVThe halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.
p128
aVIt's larger than some of the other symphony halls.
p129
aVAnd they're a lot more reverberant
p130
aVthan La Scala.
p131
aVAround the same,
p132
aVaccording to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker,
p133
aVthis kind of rule came into effect
p134
aVthat audiences had to be quiet \u2014
p135
aVno more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage,
p136
aVor gossiping with one another
p137
aVduring the show.
p138
aVThey had to be very quiet.
p139
aVSo those two things combined meant that
p140
aVa different kind of music
p141
aVworked best in these kind of halls.
p142
aVIt meant that there could be extreme dynamics,
p143
aVwhich there weren't in some of these
p144
aVother kinds of music.
p145
aVQuiet parts could be heard
p146
aVthat would have been drowned out
p147
aVby all the gossiping and shouting.
p148
aVBut because of the reverberation
p149
aVin those rooms like Carnegie Hall,
p150
aVthe music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic
p151
aVand a little more textural.
p152
aV(Music: "Symphony No. 8 in E Flat Major" by Gustav Mahler)
p153
aVThis is Mahler.
p154
aVIt looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.
p155
aVThat was Bob's last record, yeah.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VPopular music, coming along at the same time.
p160
aVThis is a jazz band.
p161
aVAccording to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing
p162
aVon riverboats and clubs.
p163
aVAgain, it's noisy. They're playing for dancers.
p164
aVThere's certain sections of the song \u2014 the songs had different sections
p165
aVthat the dancers really liked.
p166
aVAnd they'd say, "Play that part again."
p167
aVWell, there's only so many times
p168
aVyou can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.
p169
aVSo the bands started to improvise new melodies.
p170
aVAnd a new form of music was born.
p171
aV(Music: "Royal Garden Blues" by W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters)
p172
aVThese are played mainly in small rooms.
p173
aVPeople are dancing, shouting and drinking.
p174
aVSo the music has to be loud enough
p175
aVto be heard above that.
p176
aVSame thing goes true for \u2014 that's the beginning of the century \u2014
p177
aVfor the whole of 20th-century popular music,
p178
aVwhether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.
p179
aV[Live music] doesn't really change that much.
p180
aa(lp181
VIt changes about a third of the way into the 20th century,
p182
aVwhen this became
p183
aVone of the primary venues for music.
p184
aVAnd this was one way
p185
aVthat the music got there.
p186
aVMicrophones enabled singers, in particular,
p187
aVand musicians and composers,
p188
aVto completely change the kind of music
p189
aVthat they were writing.
p190
aVSo far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music,
p191
aVbut singers, like Frank Sinatra,
p192
aVcould use the mic
p193
aVand do things
p194
aVthat they could never do without a microphone.
p195
aVOther singers after him
p196
aVwent even further.
p197
aV(Music: "My Funny Valentine" by Chet Baker)
p198
aVThis is Chet Baker.
p199
aVAnd this kind of thing
p200
aVwould have been impossible without a microphone.
p201
aVIt would have been impossible without recorded music as well.
p202
aVAnd he's singing right into your ear.
p203
aVHe's whispering into your ears.
p204
aVThe effect is just electric.
p205
aVIt's like the guy is sitting next to you,
p206
aVwhispering who knows what into your ear.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo at this point, music diverged.
p209
aVThere's live music,
p210
aVand there's recorded music.
p211
aVAnd they no longer have to be exactly the same.
p212
aVNow there's venues like this, a discotheque,
p213
aVand there's jukeboxes in bars,
p214
aVwhere you don't even need to have a band.
p215
aVThere doesn't need to be any
p216
aVlive performing musicians whatsoever,
p217
aVand the sound systems are good.
p218
aVPeople began to make music
p219
aVspecifically for discos
p220
aVand for those sound systems.
p221
aVAnd, as with jazz,
p222
aVthe dancers liked certain sections
p223
aVmore than they did others.
p224
aVSo the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections.
p225
aV(Music: "Rapper's Delight" by The Sugarhill Gang)
p226
aVThe MC would improvise lyrics
p227
aVin the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies.
p228
aVAnd another new form of music was born.
p229
aa(lp230
VLive performance, when it was incredibly successful,
p231
aVended up in what is probably, acoustically,
p232
aVthe worst sounding venues on the planet:
p233
aVsports stadiums,
p234
aVbasketball arenas and hockey arenas.
p235
aVMusicians who ended up there did the best they could.
p236
aVThey wrote what is now called arena rock,
p237
aVwhich is medium-speed ballads.
p238
aV(Music: "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by U2)
p239
aVThey did the best they could
p240
aVgiven that this is what they're writing for.
p241
aVThe tempos are medium. It sounds big.
p242
aVIt's more a social situation
p243
aVthan a musical situation.
p244
aVAnd in some ways, the music
p245
aVthat they're writing for this place
p246
aVworks perfectly.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo there's more new venues.
p249
aVOne of the new ones is the automobile.
p250
aVI grew up with a radio in a car.
p251
aVBut now that's evolved into something else.
p252
aVThe car is a whole venue.
p253
aV(Music: "Who U Wit" by Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz)
p254
aVThe music that, I would say, is written
p255
aVfor automobile sound systems
p256
aVworks perfectly on it.
p257
aVIt might not be what you want to listen to at home,
p258
aVbut it works great in the car \u2014
p259
aVhas a huge frequency spectrum,
p260
aVyou know, big bass and high-end
p261
aVand the voice kind of stuck in the middle.
p262
aVAutomobile music, you can share with your friends.
p263
aa(lp264
VThere's one other kind of new venue,
p265
aVthe private MP3 player.
p266
aVPresumably, this is just for Christian music.
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aVAnd in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall,
p269
aVor when the audience had to hush up,
p270
aVbecause you can now hear every single detail.
p271
aVIn other ways, it's more like the West African music
p272
aVbecause if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet,
p273
aVyou turn it up, and the next minute,
p274
aVyour ears are blasted out by a louder passage.
p275
aVSo that doesn't really work.
p276
aVI think pop music, mainly,
p277
aVit's written today,
p278
aVto some extent, is written for these kind of players,
p279
aVfor this kind of personal experience
p280
aVwhere you can hear extreme detail,
p281
aVbut the dynamic doesn't change that much.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo I asked myself:
p284
aVOkay, is this
p285
aVa model for creation,
p286
aVthis adaptation that we do?
p287
aVAnd does it happen anywhere else?
p288
aVWell, according to David Attenborough and some other people,
p289
aVbirds do it too \u2014
p290
aVthat the birds in the canopy,
p291
aVwhere the foliage is dense,
p292
aVtheir calls tend to be
p293
aVhigh-pitched, short and repetitive.
p294
aVAnd the birds on the floor
p295
aVtend to have lower pitched calls,
p296
aVso that they don't get distorted
p297
aVwhen they bounce off the forest floor.
p298
aVAnd birds like this Savannah sparrow,
p299
aVthey tend to have a buzzing
p300
aV(Sound clip: Savannah sparrow song)
p301
aVtype call.
p302
aVAnd it turns out that
p303
aVa sound like this
p304
aVis the most energy efficient and practical way
p305
aVto transmit their call
p306
aVacross the fields and savannahs.
p307
aVOther birds, like this tanager,
p308
aVhave adapted within the same species.
p309
aVThe tananger on the East Coast of the United States,
p310
aVwhere the forests are a little denser,
p311
aVhas one kind of call,
p312
aVand the tananger on the other side, on the west
p313
aV(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)
p314
aVhas a different kind of call.
p315
aV(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)
p316
aVSo birds do it too.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd I thought:
p319
aVWell, if this is a model for creation,
p320
aVif we make music,
p321
aVprimarily the form at least,
p322
aVto fit these contexts,
p323
aVand if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls,
p324
aVand if we write software to fit existing operating systems,
p325
aVis that how it works?
p326
aVYeah. I think it's evolutionary.
p327
aVIt's adaptive.
p328
aVBut the pleasure and the passion and the joy
p329
aVis still there.
p330
aVThis is a reverse view of things
p331
aVfrom the kind of traditional Romantic view.
p332
aVThe Romantic view is that
p333
aVfirst comes the passion
p334
aVand then the outpouring of emotion,
p335
aVand then somehow it gets shaped into something.
p336
aVAnd I'm saying,
p337
aVwell, the passion's still there,
p338
aVbut the vessel
p339
aVthat it's going to be injected into and poured into,
p340
aVthat is instinctively and intuitively
p341
aVcreated first.
p342
aVWe already know where that passion is going.
p343
aVBut this conflict of views is kind of interesting.
p344
aa(lp345
VThe writer,
p346
aVThomas Frank,
p347
aVsays that
p348
aVthis might be a kind of explanation
p349
aVwhy some voters vote
p350
aVagainst their best interests,
p351
aVthat voters, like a lot of us,
p352
aVassume, that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere,
p353
aVthat it's coming from the gut, that it's passionate,
p354
aVthat it's more authentic.
p355
aVAnd they'll vote for that.
p356
aVSo that, if somebody can fake sincerity,
p357
aVif they can fake passion,
p358
aVthey stand a better chance
p359
aVof being selected in that way,
p360
aVwhich seems a little dangerous.
p361
aVI'm saying the two, the passion, the joy,
p362
aVare not mutually exclusive.
p363
aa(lp364
VMaybe what the world needs now is for us to realize
p365
aVthat we are like the birds.
p366
aVWe adapt.
p367
aVWe sing.
p368
aVAnd like the birds, the joy is still there,
p369
aVeven though we have changed what we do
p370
aVto fit the context.
p371
aa(lp372
VThank you very much.

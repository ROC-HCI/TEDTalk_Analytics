VI want you to take a look at this baby.
p5
aVWhat you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch.
p6
aVBut today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see.
p7
aVWhat's going on up in that little brain of hers.
p8
aVThe modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us
p9
aVthat what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science.
p10
aVAnd what we're learning is going to shed some light
p11
aVon what the romantic writers and poets described as the "celestial openness"
p12
aVof the child's mind.
p13
aa(lp14
VWhat we see here is a mother in India,
p15
aVand she's speaking Koro, which is a newly discovered language.
p16
aVAnd she's talking to her baby.
p17
aVWhat this mother \u2014
p18
aVand the 800 people who speak Koro in the world \u2014
p19
aVunderstands is that, to preserve this language,
p20
aVthey need to speak it to the babies.
p21
aVAnd therein lies a critical puzzle.
p22
aVWhy is it that you can't preserve a language
p23
aVby speaking to you and I, to the adults?
p24
aVWell, it's got to do with your brain.
p25
aVWhat we see here is that language has a critical period for learning.
p26
aVThe way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language.
p31
aVThe babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven,
p32
aVand then there's a systematic decline.
p33
aVAfter puberty, we fall off the map.
p34
aVNo scientists dispute this curve,
p35
aVbut laboratories all over the world
p36
aVare trying to figure out why it works this way.
p37
aa(lp38
VWork in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development,
p39
aVand that is the period in which babies
p40
aVtry to master which sounds are used in their language.
p41
aVWe think, by studying how the sounds are learned,
p42
aVwe'll have a model for the rest of language,
p43
aVand perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood
p44
aVfor social, emotional and cognitive development.
p45
aVSo we've been studying the babies
p46
aVusing a technique that we're using all over the world
p47
aVand the sounds of all languages.
p48
aVThe baby sits on a parent's lap,
p49
aVand we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes \u2014
p50
aVlike from "ah" to "ee."
p51
aVIf they do so at the appropriate time, the black box lights up
p52
aVand a panda bear pounds a drum.
p53
aVA six-monther adores the task.
p54
aa(lp55
VWhat have we learned?
p56
aVWell, babies all over the world
p57
aVare what I like to describe as "citizens of the world."
p58
aVThey can discriminate all the sounds of all languages,
p59
aVno matter what country we're testing and what language we're using,
p60
aVand that's remarkable because you and I can't do that.
p61
aVWe're culture-bound listeners.
p62
aVWe can discriminate the sounds of our own language,
p63
aVbut not those of foreign languages.
p64
aVSo the question arises: When do those citizens of the world
p65
aVturn into the language-bound listeners that we are?
p66
aVAnd the answer: before their first birthdays.
p67
aVWhat you see here is performance on that head-turn task
p68
aVfor babies tested in Tokyo and the United States,
p69
aVhere in Seattle,
p70
aVas they listened to "ra" and "la" \u2014
p71
aVsounds important to English, but not to Japanese.
p72
aVSo at six to eight months, the babies are totally equivalent.
p73
aVTwo months later, something incredible occurs.
p74
aVThe babies in the United States are getting a lot better,
p75
aVbabies in Japan are getting a lot worse,
p76
aVbut both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language
p77
aVthat they are going to learn.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo the question is: What's happening during this critical two-month period?
p80
aVThis is the critical period for sound development,
p81
aVbut what's going on up there?
p82
aVSo there are two things going on.
p83
aVThe first is that the babies are listening intently to us,
p84
aVand they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk \u2014
p85
aVthey're taking statistics.
p86
aVSo listen to two mothers speaking motherese \u2014
p87
aVthe universal language we use when we talk to kids \u2014
p88
aVfirst in English and then in Japanese.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes \u2014
p91
aVso pretty and nice.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Japanese)
p94
aa(lp95
VPatricia Kuhl: During the production of speech, when babies listen,
p96
aVwhat they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear.
p97
aVAnd those distributions grow.
p98
aVAnd what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics,
p99
aVand the statistics of Japanese and English are very, very different.
p100
aVEnglish has a lot of Rs and Ls.
p101
aVThe distribution shows.
p102
aVAnd the distribution of Japanese is totally different,
p103
aVwhere we see a group of intermediate sounds,
p104
aVwhich is known as the Japanese "R."
p105
aVSo babies absorb the statistics of the language
p106
aVand it changes their brains;
p107
aVit changes them from the citizens of the world
p108
aVto the culture-bound listeners that we are.
p109
aVBut we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics.
p110
aVWe are governed by the representations in memory
p111
aVthat were formed early in development.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo what we're seeing here
p114
aVis changing our models of what the critical period is about.
p115
aVWe're arguing from a mathematical standpoint
p116
aVthat the learning of language material may slow down
p117
aVwhen our distributions stabilize.
p118
aVIt's raising lots of questions about bilingual people.
p119
aVBilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once
p120
aVand flip between them, one after the other,
p121
aVdepending on who they're speaking to.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo we asked ourselves,
p124
aVcan the babies take statistics on a brand new language?
p125
aVAnd we tested this by exposing American babies
p126
aVwho'd never heard a second language
p127
aVto Mandarin for the first time during the critical period.
p128
aVWe knew that, when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle
p129
aVon the Mandarin sounds, they showed the same pattern.
p130
aVSix to eight months, they're totally equivalent.
p131
aVTwo months later, something incredible happens.
p132
aVBut the Taiwanese babies are getting better, not the American babies.
p133
aVWhat we did was expose American babies, during this period, to Mandarin.
p134
aVIt was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month
p135
aVand move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions.
p136
aVHere's what it looked like in the laboratory.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Mandarin)
p139
aa(lp140
VPK: So what have we done to their little brains?
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VWe had to run a control group to make sure
p145
aVthat coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills.
p146
aVSo a group of babies came in and listened to English.
p147
aVAnd we can see from the graph
p148
aVthat exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin.
p149
aVBut look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.
p150
aVThey were as good as the babies in Taiwan
p151
aVwho'd been listening for 10 and a half months.
p152
aVWhat it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language.
p153
aVWhatever you put in front of them, they'll take statistics on.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut we wondered what role
p156
aVthe human being played in this learning exercise.
p157
aVSo we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage,
p158
aVthe same 12 sessions, but over a television set.
p159
aVAnd another group of babies who had just audio exposure
p160
aVand looked at a teddy bear on the screen.
p161
aVWhat did we do to their brains?
p162
aVWhat you see here is the audio result \u2014
p163
aVno learning whatsoever \u2014
p164
aVand the video result \u2014
p165
aVno learning whatsoever.
p166
aVIt takes a human being for babies to take their statistics.
p167
aVThe social brain is controlling
p168
aVwhen the babies are taking their statistics.
p169
aa(lp170
VWe want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening
p171
aVas babies are in front of televisions, as opposed to in front of human beings.
p172
aVThankfully, we have a new machine, magnetoencephalography,
p173
aVthat allows us to do this.
p174
aVIt looks like a hair dryer from Mars.
p175
aVBut it's completely safe, completely noninvasive and silent.
p176
aVWe're looking at millimeter accuracy
p177
aVwith regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy
p178
aVusing 306 SQUIDs \u2014
p179
aVthese are superconducting quantum interference devices \u2014
p180
aVto pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking.
p181
aVWe're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine
p182
aVwhile they are learning.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo this is little Emma.
p185
aVShe's a six-monther.
p186
aVAnd she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears.
p187
aVYou can see, she can move around.
p188
aVWe're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap,
p189
aVso she's free to move completely unconstrained.
p190
aVIt's a technical tour de force.
p191
aVWhat are we seeing?
p192
aVWe're seeing the baby brain.
p193
aVAs the baby hears a word in her language, the auditory areas light up,
p194
aVand then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence,
p195
aVgetting the brain coordinated with its different areas, and causality,
p196
aVone brain area causing another to activate.
p197
aa(lp198
VWe are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge
p199
aVabout child's brain development.
p200
aVWe're going to be able to see a child's brain
p201
aVas they experience an emotion, as they learn to speak and read,
p202
aVas they solve a math problem, as they have an idea.
p203
aVAnd we're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions
p204
aVfor children who have difficulty learning.
p205
aVJust as the poets and writers described,
p206
aVwe're going to be able to see, I think, that wondrous openness,
p207
aVutter and complete openness, of the mind of a child.
p208
aVIn investigating the child's brain,
p209
aVwe're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human,
p210
aVand in the process,
p211
aVwe may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning
p212
aVfor our entire lives.
p213
aa(lp214
VThank you.

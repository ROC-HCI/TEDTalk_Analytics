VSo what's image got do with it?
p5
aVAnd I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send
p6
aVa lot of subliminal messages,
p7
aVbecause I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues
p8
aVthat have come up.
p9
aVBut I'm going to try and do something different,
p10
aVand try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories,
p11
aVand try and put a face to a lot of the issues
p12
aVthat we've been talking about.
p13
aVSo, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,
p14
aVas you can see.
p15
aVWe're not the only ones.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
V(Applause)
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd you know, it's amazing.
p22
aVI mean, we need a whole conference
p23
aVjust devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.
p24
aVJust think about that, you know?
p25
aVAnd this is typically what we've been talking about,
p26
aVthe role that the media plays in focusing
p27
aVjust on the negative stuff.
p28
aVNow, why is that a problem?
p29
aVA typical disaster story:
p30
aVdisease, corruption, poverty.
p31
aVAnd some of you might be standing here thinking,
p32
aVsaying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated,
p33
aVand all you privileged people come here, saying,
p34
aV'Forget the poor people.
p35
aVLet's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' "
p36
aVAnd they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans
p37
aVwho really need help."
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?
p40
aVAnd it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.
p41
aVWe start with poverty.
p42
aVI didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire,
p43
aVbut I know what it is to grow up without having money,
p44
aVor being able to support family.
p45
aVEuvin was talking about bellwether signs.
p46
aVThe bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.
p47
aVYou know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.
p48
aVWhen things were bad, we had porridge.
p49
aVAnd like many African families,
p50
aVmy parents could never save
p51
aVbecause they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,
p52
aVand things were always dicey.
p53
aVNow, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid,
p54
aVand they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school,
p55
aVwhich was free.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd they adopted a very interesting
p58
aVapproach to education, which was
p59
aVthey were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.
p60
aVSo they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school,
p61
aVwhich set the foundation for what ended up being my career.
p62
aVAnd what happened was,
p63
aVbecause they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not,
p64
aVI got kicked out pretty much every term.
p65
aVYou know, someone would come in with a list
p66
aVof the people who haven't paid school fees,
p67
aVand when they started getting pretty strict,
p68
aVyou had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.
p69
aVAnd I remember thinking, I mean,
p70
aVwhy don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?
p71
aVBecause you know, as a kid
p72
aVyou're embarrassed and
p73
aVyou're sensitive, and everyone knows
p74
aVyou guys don't have money.
p75
aVBut they kept at it,
p76
aVand I now understand why they did what they did.
p77
aa(lp78
VThey talk about corruption.
p79
aVIn Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.
p80
aVAnd there's national schools, which are like the best schools,
p81
aVand provincial schools.
p82
aVMy dream school at that time was Kenya High School,
p83
aVa national school.
p84
aVI missed the cutoff by one point.
p85
aVAnd I was so disappointed, and I was like,
p86
aV"Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"
p87
aVAnd my father said, "OK, listen.
p88
aVLet's go and try and talk to the headmistress.
p89
aVYou know, it's just one point. I mean,
p90
aVmaybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there."
p91
aVSo we went to the school,
p92
aVand because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,
p93
aVand because my father didn't have the right last name,
p94
aVhe was treated like dirt.
p95
aVAnd I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,
p96
aVyou know, who do you think you are?
p97
aVAnd, you know, you must be joking if you think
p98
aVyou can get a slot.
p99
aVAnd I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,
p100
aVand who had done much, much worse than I did,
p101
aVand they had slots there.
p102
aVAnd there's nothing worse than seeing your parent
p103
aVbeing humiliated in front of you, you know?
p104
aVAnd we left, and I swore to myself,
p105
aVand I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have
p106
aVto beg for anything in my life."
p107
aVThey called me two weeks later, they're like,
p108
aVoh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
VFinal story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.
p113
aVDisease.
p114
aVMy father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.
p115
aVHe never told anyone that he had AIDS,
p116
aVhis fear of the stigma was so strong.
p117
aVAnd I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.
p118
aVAnd I was in the States at the time,
p119
aVand they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.
p120
aVAnd he had Cryptococcal meningitis.
p121
aVAnd so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.
p122
aVBecause of doctor-patient privilege,
p123
aVthey couldn't really tell us what was going on.
p124
aVBut they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.
p125
aVAnd when I went online and looked at the infectious \u2014
p126
aVread about the disease,
p127
aVI pretty much realized what was going on.
p128
aa(lp129
VThe first time he got sick, he recovered.
p130
aVBut what happened was that he had to be on medication
p131
aVthat, at that time \u2014 Diflucan, which in the States
p132
aVis used for yeast infections \u2014 cost 30 dollars a pill.
p133
aVHe had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.
p134
aVYou know, so money ran out.
p135
aVHe got sick again.
p136
aVAnd up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,
p137
aVand he used to import, bring him, could
p138
aVget him a generic version of it.
p139
aVAnd that kept him going.
p140
aVBut the money ran out.
p141
aVHe got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.
p142
aVAt that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,
p143
aVand we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash
p144
aVfor him to start the treatment until Monday.
p145
aVThe hospital put him on a water drip for three days.
p146
aVAnd finally, we figured, well, OK,
p147
aVwe'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.
p148
aVAt least he'll get treated
p149
aVwhile we try to figure out the money situation.
p150
aVAnd he died when the ambulance was coming
p151
aVto the hospital to take him.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd, you know, now, imagine if \u2014 and I could go on and on \u2014
p154
aVimagine if this is all you know about me.
p155
aVHow would you look at me?
p156
aVWith pity, you know. Sadness.
p157
aVAnd this is how you look at Africa.
p158
aVThis is the damage it causes.
p159
aVYou don't see the other side of me.
p160
aVYou don't see the blogger,
p161
aVyou don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer,
p162
aVthe vibrant person, you know?
p163
aVAnd I just wanted to personalize that.
p164
aVBecause we talk about it in big terms,
p165
aVand you wonder, you know, so what?
p166
aVBut it's damaging.
p167
aVAnd I'm not unique, right?
p168
aVImagine if all you knew about William
p169
aVwas the fact that he grew up in a poor village.
p170
aVAnd you didn't know about the windmill, you know?
p171
aVAnd I was just moved.
p172
aVI was actually crying during his presentation.
p173
aVHe was like, I try and I make.
p174
aVI was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!"
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.
p179
aVWhen you focus just on the disasters \u2014
p180
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p181
aV\u2014 we're ignoring the potential.
p182
aVSo, what is to be done?
p183
aVFirst of all,
p184
aVAfricans, we need to get better at telling our stories.
p185
aVWe heard about that yesterday.
p186
aVWe had some of them this morning.
p187
aVAnd this is an example, you know,
p188
aVblogging is one way of doing that.
p189
aVAfrigator is an aggregator of African blogs
p190
aVthat was developed in South Africa.
p191
aVSo we need to start getting better.
p192
aVIf no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.
p193
aVAnd going back to the point I was trying to make,
p194
aVthis is the Swahili Wikipedia.
p195
aVSwahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.
p196
aVIt only has five contributors.
p197
aVFour of them are white males \u2014 non-native speakers.
p198
aVThe other person is \u2014 Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up \u2014
p199
aVis a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.
p200
aVHe's the only African who's contributing to this.
p201
aa(lp202
VPeople, please. We can't whine and complain
p203
aVthe West is doing this.
p204
aVWhat are we doing?
p205
aVWhere are the rest of the Swahili speakers?
p206
aVWhy are we not generating our own content?
p207
aVYou know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.
p208
aVReuters now integrates African blogs
p209
aVinto their coverage of Africa.
p210
aVSo, that's a start,
p211
aVand we've heard of all their other initiatives.
p212
aVThe cheetah generation.
p213
aVThe aid approach, you know, is flawed.
p214
aVAnd after all the hoopla of Live 8,
p215
aVwe're still not anywhere in the picture.
p216
aVNo, you're not.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VBut the point I'm trying to make, though,
p221
aVis that it's not enough for us to criticize.
p222
aVAnd for those of you in the diaspora
p223
aVwho are struggling with where should I be,
p224
aVshould I move back,
p225
aVshould I stay?
p226
aVYou know, just jump.
p227
aVThe continent needs you.
p228
aVAnd I can't emphasize that enough, you know.
p229
aVI walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,
p230
aVCovington and Burling, six figures.
p231
aVWith two paychecks, or three paychecks,
p232
aVI could solve a lot of my family's problems.
p233
aVBut I walked away from that, because my passion was here,
p234
aVand because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.
p235
aVAnd because I'm needed here, you know?
p236
aVI probably can win a prize for the most ways
p237
aVto use a Harvard Law School degree
p238
aVbecause of all the things I'm doing.
p239
aa(lp240
VOne is because I'm pretty aggressive,
p241
aVand I try and find, you know, opportunities.
p242
aVBut there is such a need, you know?
p243
aVI'm a corporate lawyer most of the time
p244
aVfor an organization called Enablis
p245
aVthat supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.
p246
aVWe're now moving into East Africa.
p247
aVAnd we give them business development services,
p248
aVas well as financing loan and equity.
p249
aVI've also set up a project in Kenya,
p250
aVand what we do is we track the performance
p251
aVof Kenyan MPs.
p252
aVMy partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.
p253
aVIt costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.
p254
aVEverything else on there is a labor of love.
p255
aVWe've manually entered all the data there.
p256
aVAnd you can get profiles of each MP,
p257
aVquestions they've asked in parliament.
p258
aVWe have a comment function,
p259
aVwhere people can ask their MPs questions.
p260
aVThere are some MPs who participate,
p261
aVand come back and ask.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd basically, we started this because we were tired
p264
aVof complaining about our politicians.
p265
aVYou know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.
p266
aVYou're not just going to be accountable
p267
aVout of the goodness of your heart.
p268
aVAnd we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.
p269
aVWhat are they doing?
p270
aVYou know, they're not going to change
p271
aVjust out of nowhere.
p272
aVSo we need new policies, we need \u2014
p273
aVwhere's that coming from, you know?
p274
aVAnother thing is that these leaders
p275
aVare a reflection of our society.
p276
aVWe talk about African governments
p277
aVlike they've been dropped from Mars, you know?
p278
aVThey come from us.
p279
aVAnd what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?
p280
aVAnd how can we change that?
p281
aVSo Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start
p282
aVinspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.
p283
aVWhere do we go from here?
p284
aVI believe in the power of ideas.
p285
aVI believe in the power of sharing knowledge.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share,
p288
aVand keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,
p289
aVbecause it can make a difference.
p290
aVThe other thing I want to urge you to do
p291
aVis take an interest in the individual.
p292
aVI've had lots of conversations about things I think
p293
aVneed to be happening in Africa.
p294
aVPeople are like, "OK, if you don't do aid,
p295
aVI'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"
p296
aVAnd when I talk about my ideas, they're like,
p297
aV"BBut it's not scalable, you know.
p298
aVGive me something I can do with Paypal."
p299
aVIt's not that easy, you know?
p300
aVAnd sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,
p301
aVin the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,
p302
aVit can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,
p303
aVbecause usually the individual in Africa
p304
aVcarries a lot of people behind them.
p305
aVPractically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,
p306
aVmy mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.
p307
aVMy sister was struggling to get through undergrad.
p308
aVI was helping her pay her tuition.
p309
aVMy cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.
p310
aVI was paying her school fees.
p311
aa(lp312
VA cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan,
p313
aVso we said, well, what are we going to do with her?
p314
aVYou know, she's now my baby sister.
p315
aVAnd because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,
p316
aVI am able to lift all those people.
p317
aVSo, don't underestimate that.
p318
aVAn example. This man changed my life.
p319
aVHe's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.
p320
aVHe's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.
p321
aVAnd because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,
p322
aVbecause he took an interest.
p323
aVI was taking a class of his, and he was just like,
p324
aVthis is an overeager student,
p325
aVwhich we don't normally get in the United States,
p326
aVbecause everyone else is cynical and jaded.
p327
aVHe called me to his office and said,
p328
aV"What do you want to do when you grow up?"
p329
aVI said, "I want to be a lawyer."
p330
aVAnd he was like, "Why? You know,
p331
aVwe don't need another lawyer in the United States."
p332
aVAnd he tried to talk me out of it,
p333
aVbut it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,
p334
aVI'm poli-sci Ph.D.
p335
aVBut, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,
p336
aVwhat I need to do to help you out."
p337
aa(lp338
VIt was like, "Where do you want to go?"
p339
aVAnd to me at that time university \u2014
p340
aVI was at University of Pitts for undergrad,
p341
aVand that was like heaven, OK,
p342
aVbecause compared to what could have been in Kenya.
p343
aVSo I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."
p344
aVHe was like, "Why? You know, you're smart,
p345
aVyou have all these things going for you."
p346
aVAnd I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap,
p347
aVand you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."
p348
aVLike, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard
p349
aVfor applying to law school.
p350
aVAnd, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.
p351
aVAnd he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard,
p352
aVyou're that good, OK?
p353
aVAnd if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up."
p354
aVAnd he built me up, you know?
p355
aVAnd this is just an illustration.
p356
aa(lp357
VYou can meet other individuals here.
p358
aVWe just need a push.
p359
aVThat's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.
p360
aVBasically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?
p361
aVA gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity
p362
aVof us having to leave the continent
p363
aVso that we can fulfill our potential.
p364
aVYou know, my vision is that my daughter,
p365
aVand any other African child being born today,
p366
aVcan be whoever they want to be here,
p367
aVwithout having to leave.
p368
aVAnd they can have the possibility of transcending
p369
aVthe circumstances under which they were born.
p370
aVThat's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?
p371
aVThat you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,
p372
aVand you can move.
p373
aVJust because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,
p374
aVthat doesn't define who you are.
p375
aVFor most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,
p376
aVand the circumstances under which you were born,
p377
aVdetermine the rest of your life.
p378
aVI would like to see that change,
p379
aVand the change starts with us.
p380
aVAnd as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.
p381
aVThank you.

VIn the 1980s, in communist Eastern Germany,
p5
aVif you owned a typewriter,
p6
aVyou had to register it with the government.
p7
aVYou had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter.
p8
aVAnd this was done so the government could track
p9
aVwhere the text was coming from.
p10
aVIf they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought,
p11
aVthey could track down who created that thought.
p12
aVAnd we in the West
p13
aVcouldn't understand how anybody would do this,
p14
aVhow much this would restrict freedom of speech.
p15
aVWe would never do that in our own countries.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut today, in 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer
p18
aVfrom any major laser printer manufacturer
p19
aVand print a page,
p20
aVthat page will end up
p21
aVhaving slight yellow dots printed on every single page,
p22
aVin a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer.
p23
aVThis is happening to us today.
p24
aVAnd nobody seems to be making a fuss about it.
p25
aVAnd this is an example
p26
aVof the ways our own governments are using technology
p27
aVagainst us, the citizens.
p28
aVAnd this is one of the main three sources of online problems today.
p29
aa(lp30
VIf we look at what's really happening in the online world,
p31
aVwe can group the attacks based on the attackers.
p32
aVWe have three main groups.
p33
aVWe have online criminals.
p34
aVLike here, we have Mr. Dmitry Golubov,
p35
aVfrom the city of Kiev in Ukraine.
p36
aVAnd the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand.
p37
aVThese guys make money.
p38
aVThey use online attacks to make lots of money \u2014
p39
aVand lots and lots of it.
p40
aVWe actually have several cases of millionaires online, multimillionaires,
p41
aVwho made money with their attacks.
p42
aVHere's Vladimir Tsastsin, from Tartu in Estonia.
p43
aVThis is [Albert] Gonzalez.
p44
aVThis is Stephen Watt.
p45
aVThis is Bjorn Sundin.
p46
aVThis is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour
p47
aVand so on and so on.
p48
aa(lp49
VThese guys make their fortunes online,
p50
aVbut they make it through the illegal means
p51
aVof using things like banking Trojans
p52
aVto steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking,
p53
aVor with keyloggers
p54
aVto collect our credit card information
p55
aVwhile we are doing online shopping from an infected computer.
p56
aVThe US Secret Service,
p57
aVtwo months ago, froze the Swiss bank account
p58
aVof Mr. Sam Jain right here,
p59
aVand that bank account had 14.9 million US dollars in it
p60
aVwhen it was frozen.
p61
aVMr. Jain himself is on the loose; nobody knows where he is.
p62
aVAnd I claim it's already today
p63
aVthat it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online
p64
aVthan here in the real world.
p65
aVAnd it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse.
p66
aVIn the future, the majority of crime will be happening online.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe second major group of attackers that we are watching today
p69
aVare not motivated by money.
p70
aVThey're motivated by something else \u2014
p71
aVmotivated by protests,
p72
aVmotivated by an opinion,
p73
aVmotivated by the laughs.
p74
aVGroups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months
p75
aVand have become a major player in the field of online attacks.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo those are the three main attackers:
p78
aVcriminals who do it for the money,
p79
aVhacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest,
p80
aVbut then the last group are nation states \u2014
p81
aVgovernments doing the attacks.
p82
aVAnd then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar.
p83
aVThis is a prime example of what happens when governments attack
p84
aVagainst their own citizens.
p85
aVDigiNotar is a certificate authority from the Netherlands \u2014
p86
aVor actually, it was.
p87
aVIt was running into bankruptcy last fall,
p88
aVbecause they were hacked into.
p89
aVSomebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly.
p90
aVAnd I asked last week,
p91
aVin a meeting with Dutch government representatives,
p92
aVI asked one of the leaders of the team
p93
aVwhether he found plausible that people died
p94
aVbecause of the DigiNotar hack.
p95
aVAnd his answer was: yes.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo how do people die
p98
aVas the result of a hack like this?
p99
aVWell, DigiNotar is a CA.
p100
aVThey sell certificates.
p101
aVWhat do you do with certificates?
p102
aVWell, you need a certificate if you have a website
p103
aVthat has https, SSL encrypted services,
p104
aVservices like Gmail.
p105
aVNow we all, or a big part of us, use Gmail or one of their competitors,
p106
aVbut these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran,
p107
aVwhere dissidents use foreign services like Gmail
p108
aVbecause they know they are more trustworthy than the local services
p109
aVand they are encrypted over SSL connections,
p110
aVso the local government can't snoop on their discussions.
p111
aVExcept they can,
p112
aVif they hack into a foreign CA and issue rogue certificates.
p113
aVAnd this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar.
p114
aa(lp115
VWhat about Arab Spring
p116
aVand things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt?
p117
aVWell, in Egypt,
p118
aVthe rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police
p119
aVin April 2011,
p120
aVand when they were looting the building, they found lots of papers.
p121
aVAmong those papers was this binder entitled, "FinFisher."
p122
aVAnd within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany,
p123
aVwhich had sold to the Egyptian government
p124
aVa set of tools for intercepting, at a very large scale,
p125
aVall the communication of the citizens of the country.
p126
aVThey had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
p127
aVThe company headquarters are right here.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools
p130
aVto do this against their own citizens.
p131
aVBut Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.
p132
aVFor example, in Germany,
p133
aVjust a couple of weeks ago, the so-called "State Trojan" was found,
p134
aVwhich was a Trojan used by German government officials
p135
aVto investigate their own citizens.
p136
aVIf you are a suspect in a criminal case,
p137
aVwell, it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped.
p138
aVBut today, it goes beyond that.
p139
aVThey will tap your Internet connection.
p140
aVThey will even use tools like State Trojan
p141
aVto infect your computer with a Trojan,
p142
aVwhich enables them to watch all your communication,
p143
aVto listen to your online discussions,
p144
aVto collect your passwords.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow, when we think deeper about things like these,
p147
aVthe obvious response from people should be,
p148
aV"OK, well, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me,
p149
aVbecause I'm a legal citizen.
p150
aVWhy should I worry? Because I have nothing to hide."
p151
aVAnd this is an argument which doesn't make sense.
p152
aVPrivacy is implied.
p153
aVPrivacy is not up for discussion.
p154
aVThis is not a question
p155
aVbetween privacy
p156
aVagainst security.
p157
aVIt's a question of freedom
p158
aVagainst control.
p159
aVAnd while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011,
p160
aVany rights we give away will be given away for good.
p161
aVAnd do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government,
p162
aVa government we might have 50 years from now?
p163
aVAnd these are the questions
p164
aVthat we have to worry about for the next 50 years.

at F-Secure Corporation in Finland, Mikko Hypponen has led his team through some of the largest computer virus outbreaks in history. His team took down the world-wide network used by the Sobig.F worm. He was the first to warn the world about the Sasser outbreak, and he has done classified briefings on the operation of the&nbsp;Stuxnet worm -- a hugely complex worm designed to sabotage Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities.<br /><br />As a few hundred million more Internet users join the web from India and China and elsewhere, and as governments and corporations become more sophisticated at using viruses as weapons, Hypponen asks, what&#39;s next? Who will be at the front defending the world&rsquo;s networks from malicious software? He says: &quot;It&#39;s more than unsettling to realize there are large companies out there developing backdoors, exploits and trojans.&quot;</p><p>Even more unsettling: revelations this year that the United States&#39; NSA is conducting widespread digital surveillance of both US citizens and anyone whose data passes through a US entity, and that it has actively sabotaged encryption algorithms. Hypponen has become one of the most outspoken critics of the agency&#39;s programs and asks us all: Why are we so willing to hand over digital privacy?</p><div>&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read his open-season Q&amp;A on Reddit:&quot;My TED Talk was just posted. <a href=\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/itvu5/my_ted_talk_has_just_been_published_ama/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Ask me anything</a>.</p><p>See the full documentary on <a href=\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnedOWfPKT0\\" target=\\"_blank\\">the search for the Brain virus</a>.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "mikko_hypponen", "whotheyare": "As computer access expands, Mikko Hypponen asks: What\'s the next killer virus, and will the world be able to cope with it?

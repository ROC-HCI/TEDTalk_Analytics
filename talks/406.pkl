VI went to Spain a few months ago
p5
aVand I had the best foie gras of my life.
p6
aVThe best culinary experience of my life.
p7
aVBecause what I saw, I'm convinced, is the future of cooking.
p8
aVRidiculous, right?
p9
aVFoie gras and the future of cooking.
p10
aVThere's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras, right?
p11
aVI mean, it's crucified.
p12
aVIt was outlawed in Chicago for a while.
p13
aVIt's pending here in California, and just recently in New York.
p14
aVIt's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu,
p15
aVyou risk being attacked.
p16
aVReally, it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef.
p17
aa(lp18
VI'm not saying that there's not a rationale
p19
aVfor being opposed to foie gras.
p20
aVThe reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.
p21
aVBasically you take a goose or a duck
p22
aVand you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.
p23
aVMore grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime.
p24
aVIts liver expands by eight times.
p25
aVSuffice to say it's like \u2014 it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVI mean, I love the stuff.
p30
aVIt is fatty, it's sweet, it's silky, it's unctuous.
p31
aVIt makes everything else you put it with taste incredible.
p32
aVCan we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras?
p33
aVYes, sure.
p34
aVYou can also bike the Tour de France without steroids, right?
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVNot a lot of people are doing it.
p37
aVAnd for good reason.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VSo several months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy,
p41
aVEduardo Sousa.
p42
aVEduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.
p43
aVNatural foie gras.
p44
aVWhat's natural about foie gras?
p45
aVTo take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall,
p46
aVgeese and ducks gorge on food
p47
aVto prepare for the harsh realities of winter.
p48
aVAnd the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's land
p49
aVand eat what they want.
p50
aVSo no gavage, no force feeding,
p51
aVno factory-like conditions, no cruelty.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd it's shockingly not a new idea.
p54
aVHis great-granddad started \u2014 Patería de Sousa \u2014 in 1812.
p55
aVAnd they've been doing it quietly ever since.
p56
aVThat is until last year,
p57
aVwhen Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur,
p58
aVthe coveted French gastronomic prize.
p59
aVIt's like the Olympics of food products.
p60
aVHe placed first for his foie gras.
p61
aVBig, big problem.
p62
aVAs he said to me, that really pissed the French off.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVHe said it sort of gleefully.
p65
aa(lp66
VIt was all over the papers.
p67
aVI read about it. It was in Le Monde.
p68
aV"Spanish chef accused ... " \u2014 and the French accused him.
p69
aV"Spanish chef accused of cheating."
p70
aVThey accused him of paying off the judges.
p71
aVThey implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly.
p72
aVHuh, amazing.
p73
aVA huge scandal for a few weeks.
p74
aVCouldn't find a shred of evidence.
p75
aVNow, look at the guy.
p76
aVHe doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges
p77
aVfor his foie gras.
p78
aVSo that died down, and very soon afterward,
p79
aVnew controversy.
p80
aVHe shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.
p81
aVIt's not foie gras because it's not gavage.
p82
aVThere's no force feeding.
p83
aVSo by definition, he's lying and should be disqualified.
p84
aa(lp85
VAs funny as it sounds, articulating it now and reading about it \u2014
p86
aVactually, if we had talked about it before this controversy,
p87
aVI would have said, "That's kind of true."
p88
aVYou know, foie gras by definition, force feeding, it's gavage,
p89
aVand that's what you get when you want foie gras.
p90
aVThat is, until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura,
p91
aV50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border.
p92
aVI saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex
p93
aVand then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature,
p94
aVis utterly simple.
p95
aVAnd he said to me, really from the first moment,
p96
aVmy life's work is to give the geese what they want.
p97
aVHe repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.
p98
aVI'm just here to give the geese what they want.
p99
aVActually, when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone
p100
aVtaking pictures of them
p101
aVlike his children in the grass.
p102
aVAmazing.
p103
aVHe's really just in love with \u2014 he's at one with \u2014
p104
aVhe's the goose whisperer.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought,
p108
aVlike I'm speaking to you now, right,
p109
aVbut sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions,
p110
aVbecause the more I got to know him and his system,
p111
aVthe more exciting this whole idea became.
p112
aVHe kept going like this to me.
p113
aVAnd I thought, OK, excited Jew from New York, right?
p114
aVI'm talking a little too aggressively, whatever,
p115
aVso you know, I slowed down.
p116
aVAnd finally, by the end of the day I was like,
p117
aVEd-uar-do, you know like this?
p118
aVBut he was still going like this.
p119
aVI figured it out.
p120
aVI was speaking too loudly.
p121
aVSo I hushed my voice.
p122
aVI kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator
p123
aVin kind of a half whisper.
p124
aVAnd he stopped doing this.
p125
aVAnd amazingly, the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around \u2014
p126
aV"Get the hell away from this kid!" \u2014
p127
aVwhen I lowered my voice, they all came right up to us.
p128
aVRight up to us, like right up to here.
p129
aVRight along the fence line.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd fence line was amazing in itself.
p132
aVThe fence \u2014 like this conception of fence that we have
p133
aVit's totally backward with him.
p134
aVThe electricity on this fiberglass fence
p135
aVis only on the outside.
p136
aVHe rewired it. He invented it.
p137
aVI've never seen it. Have you?
p138
aVYou fence in animals. You electrify the inside.
p139
aVHe doesn't.
p140
aVHe electrifies only the outside.
p141
aVWhy?
p142
aVBecause he said to me that he felt like the geese \u2014
p143
aVand he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this \u2014
p144
aVthe geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks.
p145
aVEven though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden
p146
aVwith figs and everything else.
p147
aVHe felt like they felt manipulated.
p148
aVSo he got rid of the electricity,
p149
aVhe got rid of current on the inside
p150
aVand kept it on the outside,
p151
aVso it would protect them against coyotes and other predators.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, what happened?
p154
aVThey ate, and he showed me on a chart,
p155
aVhow they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers.
p156
aVThe landscape is incredible.
p157
aVI mean, his farm is incredible.
p158
aVIt really is the Garden of Eden.
p159
aVThere's figs and everything else there for the taking.
p160
aVAnd the irony of ironies is because Extremadura, the area \u2014
p161
aVwhat does Extremadura mean?
p162
aVExtra hard land, right?
p163
aVExtra difficult. Extra hard.
p164
aVBut over four generations, he and his family
p165
aVhave literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu.
p166
aVUpgrades the life for these geese.
p167
aVAnd they are allowed to take whatever they want.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnother irony, the double irony
p170
aVis that on the figs and the olives,
p171
aVEduardo can make more money selling those
p172
aVthan he can on the foie gras.
p173
aVHe doesn't care.
p174
aVHe lets them take what they want and he says,
p175
aV"Usually, it's about 50 percent. They're very fair."
p176
aVThe other 50 percent, he takes and he sells and he makes money on them.
p177
aVPart of the income for his farm.
p178
aVA big part of his income for his farm.
p179
aVBut he never controls it.
p180
aVThey get what they want,
p181
aVthey leave the rest for me and I sell it.
p182
aa(lp183
VHis biggest obstacle, really, was the marketplace,
p184
aVwhich demands these days bright yellow foie gras.
p185
aVThat's how I've been trained.
p186
aVYou want to look and see what good foie gras is,
p187
aVit's got to be bright yellow.
p188
aVIt's the indication that it's the best foie gras.
p189
aVWell, because he doesn't force feed,
p190
aVbecause he doesn't gavage tons of corn,
p191
aVhis livers were pretty grey.
p192
aVOr they were.
p193
aVBut he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush.
p194
aVThe Lupin bush, it's all around Extremadura.
p195
aVHe let it go to seed, he took the seeds,
p196
aVhe planted it on his 30 acres, all around.
p197
aVAnd the geese love the Lupin bush.
p198
aVNot for the bush, but for the seeds.
p199
aVAnd when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow.
p200
aVRadioactive yellow.
p201
aVBright yellow.
p202
aVOf the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen.
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VSo I'm listening to all this, you know, and I'm like,
p206
aVis this guy for real? Is he making some of this up?
p207
aVIs he like, you know \u2014 because he seemed to have an answer for everything,
p208
aVand it was always nature.
p209
aVIt was never him.
p210
aVAnd I was like, you know, I always get a little, like,
p211
aVweirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves.
p212
aVBecause, really, they want you to look at themselves, right?
p213
aVBut he deflected everything away from his ingenuity
p214
aVinto working with his landscape.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo it's like, here I am, I'm on the fence about this guy,
p217
aVbut increasingly, eating up his every word.
p218
aVAnd we're sitting there, and I hear [clapping] from a distance, so I look over.
p219
aVAnd he grabs my arm and the translator's,
p220
aVand ducks us under a bush and says, "Watch this."
p221
aV"Shush," he says again for the 500th time to me.
p222
aV"Shush, watch this."
p223
aVAnd this squadron of geese come over.
p224
aV[Clapping]
p225
aVAnd they're getting louder, louder, louder, like really loud, right over us.
p226
aVAnd like airport traffic control, as they start to go past us
p227
aVthey're called back \u2014 and they're called back and back and back.
p228
aVAnd then they circle around.
p229
aVAnd his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.
p230
aV[Clapping]
p231
aVAnd the wild geese are calling down.
p232
aV[Clapping]
p233
aVAnd it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle
p234
aVand they land.
p235
aVAnd I'm just saying, "No way."
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVNo way.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd I look at Eduardo, who's near tears looking at this,
p240
aVand I say, "You're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese
p241
aVto say come for a visit?"
p242
aVAnd he says, "No, no, no.
p243
aVThey've come to stay."
p244
aVThey've come to stay?
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aVIt's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter, right?
p247
aVI said that. I said "Isn't that what they're put on this Earth for?
p248
aVTo fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?"
p249
aVHe said, "No, no, no.
p250
aVTheir DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life.
p251
aVTo happiness.
p252
aVThey find it here.
p253
aVThey don't need anything more."
p254
aVThey stop. They mate with his domesticated geese,
p255
aVand his flock continues.
p256
aVThink about that for a minute.
p257
aVIt's brilliant, right?
p258
aVImagine \u2014 I don't know, imagine a hog farm
p259
aVin, like, North Carolina,
p260
aVand a wild pig comes upon a factory farm
p261
aVand decides to stay.
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VSo how did it taste?
p265
aVI finally got to taste it before I left.
p266
aVHe took me to his neighborhood restaurant
p267
aVand he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras.
p268
aVIt was incredible.
p269
aVAnd the problem with saying that, of course, is that
p270
aVyou know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily.
p271
aVAnd I'd like to make a metaphor, but I don't have one really.
p272
aVI was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much,
p273
aVhe could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like,
p274
aVthis guy's a genius, you know?
p275
aVI'm really in love with him at this point.
p276
aa(lp277
VBut it truly was the best foie gras of my life.
p278
aVSo much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment.
p279
aVI'd had something that was called foie gras.
p280
aVBut this was transformative. Really transformative.
p281
aVAnd I say to you, I might not stick to this,
p282
aVbut I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again
p283
aVbecause of that taste experience with Eduardo.
p284
aVIt was sweet, it was unctuous.
p285
aVIt had all the qualities of foie gras,
p286
aVbut its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd you could taste herbs, you could taste spices.
p289
aVAnd I kept \u2014 I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise.
p290
aVI was sure of it.
p291
aVAnd I'm not like some super taster, you know?
p292
aVBut I can taste things.
p293
aVThere's 100 percent star anise in there.
p294
aVAnd he says, "No."
p295
aVAnd I ended up like going down the spices,
p296
aVand finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper,
p297
aVthinking he's salted and peppered his liver.
p298
aVBut no.
p299
aVHe takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras,
p300
aVhe sticks them in this jar
p301
aVand he confits it.
p302
aVNo salt, no pepper, no oil, no spices.
p303
aVWhat?
p304
aa(lp305
VWe went back out for the final tour of the farm,
p306
aVand he showed me the wild pepper plants
p307
aVand the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity.
p308
aVHe doesn't need salt and pepper.
p309
aVAnd he doesn't need spices, because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors
p310
aVthat his geese love to gorge on.
p311
aVI turned to him at the end of the meal,
p312
aVand it's a question I asked several times,
p313
aVand he hadn't, kind of, answered me directly,
p314
aVbut I said, "Now look, you're in Spain,
p315
aVsome of the greatest chefs in the world are \u2014
p316
aVFerran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you.
p317
aVHow come you don't give him this?
p318
aVHow come no one's really heard of you?"
p319
aVAnd it may be because of the wine,
p320
aVor it may be because of my excitement,
p321
aVhe answered me directly and he said, "Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras."
p322
aV(Laughter)
p323
aVAnd he was right.
p324
aVHe was right.
p325
aa(lp326
VChefs take foie gras and they make it their own.
p327
aVThey create a dish
p328
aVwhere all the vectors point at us.
p329
aVWith Eduardo it's about the expression of nature.
p330
aVAnd as he said, I think fittingly,
p331
aVit's a gift from God, with God saying, you've done good work.
p332
aVSimple.
p333
aVI flew home, I'm on the flight with my little black book
p334
aVand I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it.
p335
aVI really was moved.
p336
aVAnd in the corner of one of these \u2014 one of my notes,
p337
aVis this note that says, when asked,
p338
aVwhat do you think of conventional foie gras?
p339
aVWhat do you think of foie gras that
p340
aV99.99999 percent of the world eats?
p341
aVHe said, "I think it's an insult to history."
p342
aVAnd I wrote, insult to history.
p343
aVI'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out.
p344
aVIt's like, why didn't I follow up on that?
p345
aVWhat the hell does that mean?
p346
aVInsult to history.
p347
aa(lp348
VSo I did some research when I got back,
p349
aVand here's what I found.
p350
aVThe history of foie gras.
p351
aVJews invented foie gras.
p352
aVTrue story.
p353
aVTrue story.
p354
aVBy accident.
p355
aVThey were looking for an alternative to schmaltz.
p356
aVGotten sick of the chicken fat.
p357
aVThey were looking for an alternative.
p358
aVAnd they saw in the fall that there was this natural,
p359
aVbeautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese.
p360
aVAnd they slaughtered them, used the fat throughout the winter for cooking.
p361
aVThe Pharaoh got wind of this \u2014
p362
aVThis is true, right off the Internet.
p363
aVThe Pharaoh got \u2014 (Laughter)
p364
aVI swear to God.
p365
aV(Laughter)
p366
aVThe Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it.
p367
aVHe tasted it and fell in love with it.
p368
aVHe started demanding it.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd he didn't want it just in the fall, he wanted it all year round.
p371
aVAnd he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.
p372
aVAnd the Jews, fearing for their life,
p373
aVhad to come up with an ingenious idea,
p374
aVor at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes, of course.
p375
aVAnd they invented, what? Gavage.
p376
aVThey invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives,
p377
aVand they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver,
p378
aVand the good stuff they kept for themselves.
p379
aVSupposedly, anyway. I believe that one.
p380
aa(lp381
VThat's the history of foie gras.
p382
aVAnd if you think about it,
p383
aVit's the history of industrial agriculture.
p384
aVIt's the history of what we eat today.
p385
aVMost of what we eat today.
p386
aVMega-farms, feed lots, chemical amendments,
p387
aVlong-distance travel, food processing.
p388
aVAll of it, our food system.
p389
aVThat's also an insult to history.
p390
aVIt's an insult to the basic laws of nature
p391
aVand of biology.
p392
aVWhether we're talking about beef cattle
p393
aVor we're talking about chickens,
p394
aVor we're talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts,
p395
aVor in the case of this morning's New York Times, catfish \u2014
p396
aVwhich wholesale are going out of business.
p397
aa(lp398
VWhatever it is, it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors.
p399
aVIt's rooted in extraction.
p400
aVTake more, sell more, waste more.
p401
aVAnd for the future it won't serve us.
p402
aVJonas Salk has a great quote.
p403
aVHe said, "If all the insects disappeared,
p404
aVlife on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years.
p405
aVIf human beings disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would flourish."
p406
aa(lp407
VAnd he's right.
p408
aVWe need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture.
p409
aVReally new.
p410
aVOne in which we stop treating the planet
p411
aVas if it were some kind of business in liquidation.
p412
aVAnd stop degrading resources under the guise of
p413
aVcheap food.
p414
aVWe can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo.
p415
aVFarmers that rely on nature
p416
aVfor solutions, for answers,
p417
aVrather than imposing solutions on nature.
p418
aVListening as Janine Benyus,
p419
aVone of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says,
p420
aV"Listening to nature's operating instructions."
p421
aVThat's what Eduardo does, and does so brilliantly.
p422
aVAnd what he showed me and what he can show all of us, I think,
p423
aVis that the great thing for chefs, the great blessing for chefs,
p424
aVand for people that care about food and cooking,
p425
aVis that the most ecological choice for food
p426
aVis also the most ethical choice for food.
p427
aVWhether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras.
p428
aVAnd it's also almost always, and I haven't found an example otherwise,
p429
aVbut almost always, the most delicious choice.
p430
aVThat's serendipitous.
p431
aVThank you.

VLet's begin with a story.
p5
aVOnce upon a time \u2014
p6
aVwell actually less than two years ago \u2014
p7
aVin a kingdom not so very far away,
p8
aVthere was a man
p9
aVwho traveled many miles
p10
aVto come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown \u2014
p11
aVan internationally famous company.
p12
aVLet's call it Island Networks.
p13
aVNow this kingdom had many resources
p14
aVand mighty ambitions,
p15
aVbut the one thing it lacked was people.
p16
aVAnd so it invited workers from around the world
p17
aVto come and help it build the nation.
p18
aVBut in order to enter and to stay
p19
aVthese migrants had to pass a few tests.
p20
aVAnd so it was, our man presented himself
p21
aVto authorities in the kingdom,
p22
aVlooking forward to settling into his new life.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut then something unexpected happened.
p25
aVThe medical personnel who took blood samples from the man
p26
aVnever actually told him what they were testing for.
p27
aVHe wasn't offered counseling before or after the test,
p28
aVwhich is best medical practice.
p29
aVHe was never informed of the results of the test.
p30
aVAnd yet, a couple of weeks later,
p31
aVhe was picked up and taken to prison
p32
aVwhere he was subjected to a medical exam,
p33
aVincluding a full-body search
p34
aVin full view of the others in the cell.
p35
aVHe was released, but then a day or two later,
p36
aVhe was taken to the airport and he was deported.
p37
aVWhat on earth did this man do
p38
aVto merit this treatment?
p39
aVWhat was his terrible crime?
p40
aVHe was infected with HIV.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow the kingdom is one of about 50 countries
p43
aVthat imposes restrictions on the entry or stay
p44
aVof people living with HIV.
p45
aVThe kingdom argues
p46
aVthat its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners
p47
aVwho pose a risk to the economy
p48
aVor the security or the public health
p49
aVor the morals of the state.
p50
aVBut these laws, when applied to people living with HIV,
p51
aVare a violation of international human rights agreements
p52
aVto which these countries are signatories.
p53
aVBut you know what?
p54
aVMatters of principle aside,
p55
aVpractically speaking, these laws drive HIV underground.
p56
aVPeople are less likely to come forth
p57
aVto be tested or treated or to disclose their condition,
p58
aVnone of which helps these individuals
p59
aVor the communities these laws purport to protect.
p60
aa(lp61
VToday we can prevent the transmission of HIV.
p62
aVAnd with treatment, it is a manageable condition.
p63
aVWe are very far from the days
p64
aVwhen the only practical response to dread disease
p65
aVwas to have banished the afflicted \u2014
p66
aVlike this, "The Exile of the Leper."
p67
aVSo you tell me why, in our age of science,
p68
aVwe still have laws and policies
p69
aVwhich come from an age of superstition.
p70
aa(lp71
VTime for a quick show of hands.
p72
aVWho here has been touched by HIV \u2014
p73
aVeither because you yourself have the virus
p74
aVor you have a family member or a friend or a colleague
p75
aVwho is living with HIV?
p76
aVHands up.
p77
aVWow. Wow.
p78
aVThat's a significant number of us.
p79
aa(lp80
VYou know better than anyone
p81
aVthat HIV brings out
p82
aVthe best and the worst in humanity.
p83
aVAnd the laws reflect these attitudes.
p84
aVI'm not just talking about laws on the books,
p85
aVbut laws as they are enforced on the streets
p86
aVand laws as they are decided in the courts.
p87
aVAnd I'm not just talking about laws
p88
aVas they relate to people living with HIV,
p89
aVbut people who are at greatest risk of infection \u2014
p90
aVpeople such as those who inject drugs or sex workers
p91
aVor men who have sex with men
p92
aVor transgendered persons
p93
aVor migrants or prisoners.
p94
aVAnd in many parts of the world that includes women and children
p95
aVwho are especially vulnerable.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow there are laws in many parts of the world
p98
aVwhich reflect the best of human nature.
p99
aVThese laws treat people touched by HIV
p100
aVwith compassion and acceptance.
p101
aVThese laws respect universal human rights
p102
aVand they are grounded in evidence.
p103
aVThese laws ensure that people living with HIV
p104
aVand those at greatest risk
p105
aVare protected from violence and discrimination
p106
aVand that they get access to prevention and to treatment.
p107
aVUnfortunately, these good laws
p108
aVare counter-balanced by a mass
p109
aVof really bad law \u2014
p110
aVlaw which is grounded in moral judgement
p111
aVand in fear and in misinformation,
p112
aVlaws which specifically punish people living with HIV
p113
aVor those at greatest risk.
p114
aVThese laws fly in the face of science,
p115
aVand they are grounded in prejudice
p116
aVand in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition
p117
aVand a selective reading of religion.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut you know what? You don't have to take my word for it.
p120
aVWe're going to hear from two people
p121
aVwho are on the sharp end of the law.
p122
aVThe first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American.
p123
aVAnd he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law
p124
aVon HIV transmission and exposure \u2014
p125
aVneither of which offense he actually committed.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Video) Nick Rhoades: If something is against the law
p128
aVthen that is telling society
p129
aVthat is unacceptable, that's bad behavior.
p130
aVAnd I think the severity of that punishment
p131
aVtells you how bad you are as a person.
p132
aVYou're a class B felon,
p133
aVlifetime sex offender.
p134
aVYou are a very, very, very bad person.
p135
aVAnd you did a very, very, very bad thing.
p136
aVAnd so that's just programmed into you.
p137
aVAnd you go through the correctional system
p138
aVand everyone's telling you the same thing.
p139
aVAnd you're just like, I'm a very bad person.
p140
aa(lp141
VShereen El-Feki: It's not just a question
p142
aVof unfair or ineffective laws.
p143
aVSome countries have good laws,
p144
aVlaws which could stem the tide of HIV.
p145
aVThe problem is that these laws are flouted.
p146
aVBecause stigma gives unofficial license
p147
aVto treat people living with HIV
p148
aVor those at greatest risk
p149
aVunlike other citizens.
p150
aVAnd this is exactly what happened
p151
aVto Helma and Dongo from Namibia.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Video) Hilma: I found out
p154
aVwhen I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up.
p155
aVThe nurse announced that every pregnant woman
p156
aVmust also be tested for HIV that day.
p157
aVI took the test and the result showed I was positive.
p158
aVThat's the day I found out.
p159
aVThe nurse said to me, "Why should you people bcome pregnant
p160
aVwhen you know you are HIV positive?
p161
aVWhy are you pregnant when you are living positive?"
p162
aVI am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me.
p163
aVBecause I am HIV positive.
p164
aVThey didn't give the forms to me
p165
aVor explain what was in the form.
p166
aVThe nurse just came with it
p167
aValready marked where I had to sign.
p168
aVAnd with the labor pain,
p169
aVI didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me.
p170
aVI just signed.
p171
aa(lp172
VSE: Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom
p173
aVare among the 34 million people living with HIV
p174
aVaccording to recent estimates.
p175
aVThey're the lucky ones
p176
aVbecause they're still alive.
p177
aVAccording to those same estimates,
p178
aVin 2010 1.8 million people died
p179
aVof AIDS related causes.
p180
aVThese are terrible and tragic figures.
p181
aVBut if we look a little more broadly into the statistics,
p182
aVwe actually see some reason for hope.
p183
aa(lp184
VLooking globally, the number of new infections of HIV is declining.
p185
aVAnd looking globally as well,
p186
aVdeaths are also starting to fall.
p187
aVThere are many reasons for these positive developments,
p188
aVbut one of the most remarkable
p189
aVis in the increase in the number of people around the world
p190
aVon anti-retroviral therapy,
p191
aVthe medicines they need to keep their HIV in check.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow there are still many problems.
p194
aVOnly about half of the people who need treatment
p195
aVare currently receiving it.
p196
aVIn some parts of the world \u2014
p197
aVlike here in the Middle East and North Africa \u2014
p198
aVnew infections are rising and so are deaths.
p199
aVAnd the money, the money we need
p200
aVfor the global response to HIV,
p201
aVthat is shrinking.
p202
aVBut for the first time
p203
aVin three decades into this epidemic
p204
aVwe have a real chance to come to grips with HIV.
p205
aVBut in order to do that
p206
aVwe need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law.
p207
aa(lp208
VIt's for this reason
p209
aVthat the Global Commission on HIV and the Law,
p210
aVof which I'm a member,
p211
aVwas established by the agencies of the United Nations \u2014
p212
aVto look at the ways that legal environments
p213
aVare affecting people living with HIV
p214
aVand those at greatest risk,
p215
aVand to recommend what should be done
p216
aVto make the law an ally, not an enemy,
p217
aVof the global response to HIV.
p218
aa(lp219
VLet me give you just one example
p220
aVof the way a legal environment
p221
aVcan make a positive difference.
p222
aVPeople who inject drugs
p223
aVare one of those groups I mentioned.
p224
aVThey're at high risk of HIV
p225
aVthrough contaminated injection equipment
p226
aVand other risk-related behaviors.
p227
aVIn fact, one in every 10 new infections of HIV
p228
aVis among people who inject drugs.
p229
aVNow drug use or possession
p230
aVis illegal in almost every country.
p231
aVBut some countries take a harder line on this than others.
p232
aa(lp233
VIn Thailand people who use drugs,
p234
aVor are merely suspected of using drugs,
p235
aVare placed in detention centers,
p236
aVlike the one you see here,
p237
aVwhere they are supposed to clean up.
p238
aVThere is absolutely no evidence
p239
aVto show that throwing people into detention
p240
aVcures their drug dependence.
p241
aVThere is, however, ample evidence
p242
aVto show that incarcerating people
p243
aVincreases their risk of HIV and other infections.
p244
aa(lp245
VWe know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks
p246
aVin people who inject drugs.
p247
aVIt's called harm reduction,
p248
aVand it involves, among other things,
p249
aVproviding clean needles and syringes,
p250
aVoffering opioid substitution therapy
p251
aVand other evidence-based treatments
p252
aVto reduce drug dependence.
p253
aVIt involves providing information
p254
aVand education and condoms
p255
aVto reduce HIV transmission,
p256
aVand also providing HIV testing
p257
aVand counseling and treatment
p258
aVshould people become infected.
p259
aVWhere the legal environment allows for harm reduction
p260
aVthe results are striking.
p261
aa(lp262
VAustralia and Switzerland
p263
aVwere two countries which introduced harm reduction
p264
aVvery early on in their HIV epidemics,
p265
aVand they have a very low rate of HIV
p266
aVamong injecting drug users.
p267
aVThe U.S. and Malaysia
p268
aVcame to harm reduction a little later,
p269
aVand they have higher rates of HIV in these populations.
p270
aVThailand and Russia, however,
p271
aVhave resisted harm reduction
p272
aVand have stringent laws
p273
aVwhich punish drug use.
p274
aVAnd hey, surprise,
p275
aVvery high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs.
p276
aa(lp277
VAt the Global Commission we have studied the evidence,
p278
aVand we've heard the experiences
p279
aVof over 700 people from 140 countries.
p280
aVAnd the trend? Well the trend is clear.
p281
aVWhere you criminalize people living with HIV
p282
aVor those at greatest risk,
p283
aVyou fuel the epidemic.
p284
aVNow coming up with a vaccine for HIV
p285
aVor a cure for AIDS \u2014
p286
aVnow that's rocket science.
p287
aVBut changing the law isn't.
p288
aVAnd in fact, a number of countries are starting to make progress
p289
aVon a number of points.
p290
aVTo begin, countries need to review their legislation
p291
aVas it touches HIV and vulnerable groups.
p292
aVOn the back of those reviews,
p293
aVgovernments should repeal laws
p294
aVthat punish or discriminate against people living with HIV
p295
aVor those at greatest risk.
p296
aa(lp297
VRepealing a law isn't easy,
p298
aVand it's particularly difficult
p299
aVwhen it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex.
p300
aVBut there's plenty you can do while that process is underway.
p301
aVOne of the key points is to reform the police
p302
aVso that they have better practices on the ground.
p303
aVSo for example, outreach workers
p304
aVwho are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations
p305
aVare not themselves subject to police harassment
p306
aVor abuse or arbitrary arrest.
p307
aVWe can also train judges
p308
aVso that they find flexibilities in the law
p309
aVand so that they rule on the side of tolerance
p310
aVrather than prejudice.
p311
aVWe can retool prisons
p312
aVso that HIV prevention and harm reduction
p313
aVis available to prisoners.
p314
aa(lp315
VThe key to all this is reinforcing civil society.
p316
aVBecause civil society is key
p317
aVto raising awareness among vulnerable groups
p318
aVof their legal rights.
p319
aVBut awareness needs action.
p320
aVAnd so we need to ensure
p321
aVthat these people who are living with HIV
p322
aVor at greatest risk of HIV
p323
aVhave access to legal services
p324
aVand they have equal access to the courts.
p325
aVAnd also important is talking to communities
p326
aVso that we change interpretations
p327
aVof religious or customary law,
p328
aVwhich is too often used
p329
aVto justify punishment and fuel stigma.
p330
aa(lp331
VFor many of us here
p332
aVHIV is not an abstract threat.
p333
aVIt hits very close to home.
p334
aVThe law, on the other hand,
p335
aVcan seem remote, arcane, the stuff of specialists,
p336
aVbut it isn't.
p337
aVBecause for those of us who live in democracies,
p338
aVor in aspiring democracies,
p339
aVthe law begins with us.
p340
aa(lp341
VLaws that treat people living with HIV
p342
aVor those at greatest risk with respect
p343
aVstart with the way that we treat them ourselves: as equals.
p344
aVIf we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime,
p345
aVthen that is the change we need to spread.
p346
aa(lp347
VThank you.

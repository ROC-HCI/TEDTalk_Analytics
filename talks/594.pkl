VSo it was about four years ago, five years ago,
p5
aVI was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was,
p6
aVwith a bag similar to this.
p7
aVAnd I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
p8
aVAnd I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well,
p9
aVbut your body knows it extremely well.
p10
aVAnd I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time,
p11
aVbecause we are very immune to this. This is called alpha-gal epitope.
p12
aVAnd the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them
p13
aVis the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.
p14
aa(lp15
VActually our body doesn't hate these.
p16
aVOur body loves these. It eats them.
p17
aVI mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.
p18
aVAnd if an antibody is stuck to one of these things
p19
aVon the cell, it means "that's food."
p20
aVNow, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this
p21
aVimmune response to this ridiculous molecule
p22
aVthat we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.
p23
aVBut I said we can't get rid of it,
p24
aVbecause all the people who tried to transplant heart valves
p25
aVfound out you can't get rid of that immunity.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd I said, why don't you use that?
p28
aVWhat if I could stick this molecule,
p29
aVslap it onto a bacteria
p30
aVthat was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?
p31
aVI mean I could immediately tap into
p32
aVan immune response that was already there,
p33
aVwhere it was not going to take five or six days to develop it \u2014
p34
aVit was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.
p35
aVIt was kind of like the same thing that happens when you,
p36
aVlike when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.,
p37
aVand the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car,
p38
aVand then charges you for possession of marijuana.
p39
aVIt's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VSo you can take a bacteria
p44
aVthat really doesn't make these things at all,
p45
aVand if you could clamp these on it really well
p46
aVyou have it taken off the street.
p47
aVAnd for certain bacteria
p48
aVwe don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.
p49
aVOur antibiotics are running out.
p50
aVAnd, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.
p51
aVSo probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now \u2014
p52
aVstreptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant \u2014
p53
aVbecause we won't be here. But if we are \u2014
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVwe're going to need something to do with the bacteria.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo I started working with this thing,
p58
aVwith a bunch of collaborators.
p59
aVAnd trying to attach this to things that were
p60
aVthemselves attached to certain specific target zones,
p61
aVbacteria that we don't like.
p62
aVAnd I feel now like George Bush.
p63
aVIt's like "mission accomplished."
p64
aVSo I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.
p65
aVBut basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.
p66
aVAnd it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.
p67
aa(lp68
VThis thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there,
p69
aVsort of symbolizing this right now.
p70
aVYou can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.
p71
aVAnd that DNA aptamer will attach specifically
p72
aVto a target that you have selected for it.
p73
aVSo you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like,
p74
aVlike Staphylococcus \u2014 I don't like it in particular,
p75
aVbecause it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
p76
aVIt doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.
p77
aVAnd I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.
p78
aVThat will know how to find Staph when it's in your body,
p79
aVand will alert your immune system to go after it.
p80
aa(lp81
VHere's what happened. See that line on the very top
p82
aVwith the little dots?
p83
aVThat's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned
p84
aVby our scientist friends down in Texas,
p85
aVat Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.
p86
aVAnd they had also been treated with a drug that we made
p87
aVthat would attack anthrax in particular,
p88
aVand direct your immune system to it.
p89
aVYou'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line \u2014
p90
aVthat's a 100 percent survival rate.
p91
aVAnd they actually lived another 14 days,
p92
aVor 28 when we finally killed them,
p93
aVand took them apart and figured out what went wrong.
p94
aVWhy did they not die?
p95
aVAnd they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.
p96
aVSo we did it. Okay?
p97
aa(lp98
V(Applause)
p99
aa(lp100
VMission accomplished!

Mullis shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing this technique.</p><p>As he tells it, after winning the Nobel Prize, his next career move was to learn how to surf. It&#39;s typical of Mullis, whose scientific method is to get deeply curious about a topic, work it out from first principles, and then imagine the next giant leap forward. As he puts it in his <a href=\\"http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1993/mullis-autobio.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Nobel autobiography</a>, revised several times since 1993, &quot;I read a lot, and think a  \\t\\t\\t lot, and I can talk about almost anything. Being a Nobel laureate is a license to be an  \\t\\t\\t expert in lots of things as long as you do your homework.&quot;</p><p>Most recently, he&#39;s been taking a hard look at immunity; a recent <a href=\\"http://www.patents.com/Chemically-programmable-immunity/US7422746/en-US/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">patent</a>  from his company Altermune describes the redirection of an existing immune response to a new pathogen.</p>", "slug": "kary_mullis", "whotheyare": "Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing a way to copy a strand of DNA.

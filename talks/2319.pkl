VI was raised by lesbians in the mountains,
p5
aVand I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVReally messed with my head, but I'll get into that later.
p8
aa(lp9
VI'll start with when I was eight years old.
p10
aVI took a wood box,
p11
aVand I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado.
p12
aVAnd I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box
p13
aVand learn about the way our species exchanged ideas,
p14
aVmaybe how we ate our spaghetti.
p15
aVI really didn't know.
p16
aVAnyway, this is kind of funny,
p17
aVbecause here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, at some point I was in Hawaii \u2014
p20
aVI like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff,
p21
aVand I was making a collage for my ma.
p22
aVAnd I took a dictionary and I ripped it up,
p23
aVand I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid,
p24
aVand I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck.
p25
aVNow, she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them,
p26
aVso I poured more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide it or something.
p27
aVInstead, the opposite happened:
p28
aVIt sort of created a magnification,
p29
aVlike a magnifying glass, on the dictionary text.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo what did I do? I built more boxes.
p32
aVThis time, I started putting electronics, frogs,
p33
aVstrange bottles I'd find in the street \u2014 anything I could find \u2014
p34
aVbecause I was always finding things my whole life,
p35
aVand trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects.
p36
aVSo I started drawing around the objects,
p37
aVand I realized: Holy moly, I can draw in space!
p38
aVI can make free-floating lines,
p39
aVlike the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene.
p40
aVSo I took the objects out,
p41
aVand I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens.
p42
aVFirst, botanical \u2014 which you can kind of get a sense of.
p43
aVThen I made some weird insects and creatures.
p44
aVIt was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff,
p47
aVI was making some money, I could take my girlfriend for dinner,
p48
aVand like, go to Sizzler.
p49
aVIt was some good shit, man.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VAt some point, I got up to the human form,
p53
aVlife-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers.
p54
aVThis was great, except for one thing:
p55
aVI was going to die.
p56
aVI didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
p57
aVAnd I went to bed every night thinking about it.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo I tried using glass.
p60
aVI started drawing on the layers of glass,
p61
aValmost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window,
p62
aVand another window, and you had all these windows together
p63
aVthat made a three-dimensional composition.
p64
aVAnd this really worked, because I could stop using the resin.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I did this for years,
p67
aVwhich culminated in a very large work, which I call "The Triptych."
p68
aV"The Triptych" was largely inspired
p69
aVby Hieronymus Bosch's "[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,"
p70
aVwhich is a painting in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.
p71
aVDo you guys know this painting?
p72
aVGood, it's a cool painting.
p73
aVIt's kind of ahead of its time, they say.
p74
aVSo, "The Triptych." I'll walk you through this piece.
p75
aVIt weighs 24,000 pounds.
p76
aVIt's 18 feet long.
p77
aVIt's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition.
p78
aVIt's kind of weird.
p79
aVWell, that's the blood fountain.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVTo the left, you have Jesus and the locusts.
p82
aVThere's a cave
p83
aVwhere all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds.
p84
aVThey go from the representational world,
p85
aVto this analog-mesh underworld, where they're hiding.
p86
aVThis is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse,
p87
aVand they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean.
p88
aVThe ocean is made up of thousands of elements.
p89
aVThis is a bird god tied up to a battleship.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVBilly Graham is in the ocean;
p92
aVthe Horizon from the oil spill; Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter \u2014
p93
aVthere's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find
p94
aVif you look really hard, in the ocean.
p95
aVAnyway, this is a lady creature.
p96
aVShe's coming out of the ocean, and she's spitting oil into one hand
p97
aVand she has clouds coming out of her other hand.
p98
aVHer hands are like scales,
p99
aVand she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo that's one side of "The Triptych."
p102
aVIt's a little narrative thing.
p103
aVThat's her hand that she's spitting into.
p104
aVAnd then, when you go to the other side,
p105
aVshe has like a trunk, like a bird's beak,
p106
aVand she's spitting clouds out of her trunk.
p107
aVThen she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects "The Triptych."
p108
aVAnyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aVI don't know why that happened.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VThat happens, you know.
p115
aVHer tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball,
p116
aVmade out of 1986 terrorist cards.
p117
aVHave you guys seen those?
p118
aVThey were made in the 1980's, they're like baseball cards of terrorists.
p119
aVWay ahead of their time.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VThat will bring you to my latest project.
p124
aVI'm in the middle of two projects:
p125
aVOne's called "Psychogeographies."
p126
aVIt's about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans.
p127
aVEach one is an archive of our culture,
p128
aVthrough our ripped-up media and matter,
p129
aVwhether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines.
p130
aVBut each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human,
p131
aVand they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.
p132
aVThey're like cells \u2014 they come together, they divide.
p133
aVAnd you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years.
p134
aVEach one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide
p135
aVwith a human stuck inside.
p136
aa(lp137
VThis one has a little cave in his chest.
p138
aVThat's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning.
p139
aVI'm going to go down the body for you:
p140
aVThere's a waterfall coming out of his chest,
p141
aVcovering his penis \u2014 or not-penis, or whatever it is,
p142
aVa kind of androgynous thing.
p143
aVI'll take you quickly through these works,
p144
aVbecause I can't explain them for too long.
p145
aVThere are the layers, you can kind of see it.
p146
aVThat's a body getting split in half.
p147
aVThis one has two heads,
p148
aVand it's communicating between the two heads.
p149
aVYou can see the pills coming out,
p150
aVgoing into one head from this weird statue.
p151
aVThere's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity.
p152
aVCan you see that?
p153
aa(lp154
VAnyway, this talk's all about these boxes,
p155
aVlike the boxes we're in.
p156
aVThis box we're in, the solar system is a box.
p157
aVThis brings you to my latest box.
p158
aVIt's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Cheers)
p161
aa(lp162
VInside of this box is a physicist,
p163
aVa neuroscientist, a painter, a musician,
p164
aVa writer, a radio station, a museum, a school,
p165
aVa publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world;
p166
aVa garden.
p167
aVWe shake this box up,
p168
aVand all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd I think that's the way you change the world.
p171
aVYou redefine your insides and the box that you're living in.
p172
aVAnd you come together to realize that we're all in this together,
p173
aVthat this delusion of difference \u2014
p174
aVthis idea of countries, of borders, of religion \u2014 doesn't work.
p175
aVWe're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box.
p176
aVAnd if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely,
p177
aVwe're all going to die real soon.
p178
aa(lp179
VThank you very much.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Applause)

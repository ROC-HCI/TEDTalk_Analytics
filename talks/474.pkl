VBack in 1992, I started working for a company
p5
aVcalled Interval Research,
p6
aVwhich was just then being founded
p7
aVby David Lidell and Paul Allen
p8
aVas a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley.
p9
aa(lp10
VI met with David
p11
aVto talk about what I might do in his company.
p12
aVI was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business
p13
aVand supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit
p14
aVand writing books \u2014
p15
aVafter twenty years or so in the computer game industry
p16
aVhaving ideas that people didn't think they could sell.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd David and I discovered
p19
aVthat we had a question in common,
p20
aVthat we really wanted the answer to,
p21
aVand that was,
p22
aV"Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?"
p23
aVWhy is that?
p24
aVIt can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.
p25
aVThese people aren't that smart.
p26
aVThere's six billion dollars on the table.
p27
aVThey would go for it if they could figure out how.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo, what is the deal here?
p30
aVAnd as we thought about our goals \u2014
p31
aVI should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution,
p32
aVin the classical sense
p33
aVthat humanism, at its best,
p34
aVfinds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical research
p35
aVwith a set of core values
p36
aVthat fundamentally love and respect people.
p37
aVThe basic idea of humanism
p38
aVis the improvable quality of life;
p39
aVthat we can do good things,
p40
aVthat there are things worth doing
p41
aVbecause they're good things to do,
p42
aVand that clear-eyed empiricism
p43
aVcan help us figure out how to do them.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, contrary to popular belief,
p46
aVthere is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.
p47
aVAnd Interval Research is kind of the living example
p48
aVof how that can be true.
p49
aVSo David and I decided to go find out,
p50
aVthrough the best research we could muster,
p51
aVwhat it would take to get a little girl
p52
aVto put her hands on a computer,
p53
aVto achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology
p54
aVthat little boys have because they play video games.
p55
aa(lp56
VWe spent two and a half years conducting research;
p57
aVwe spent another year and a half in advance development.
p58
aVThen we formed a spin-off company.
p59
aVIn the research phase of the project at Interval,
p60
aVwe partnered with a company called Cheskin Research,
p61
aVand these people \u2014 Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland \u2014
p62
aVchanged my mind entirely about what market research was
p63
aVand what it could be.
p64
aVThey taught me how to look and see,
p65
aVand they did not do the incredibly stupid thing
p66
aVof saying to a child,
p67
aV"Of all these things we already make you,
p68
aVwhich do you like best?" \u2014
p69
aVwhich gives you zero answers that are usable.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo, what we did for the first two and a half years
p72
aVwas four things:
p73
aVWe did an extensive review of the literature
p74
aVin related fields, like cognitive psychology,
p75
aVspatial cognition, gender studies,
p76
aVplay theory, sociology, primatology.
p77
aVThank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are,
p78
aVI love you and I'd give anything to meet you.
p79
aa(lp80
VAfter we had done that with a pretty large team of people
p81
aVand discovered what we thought the salient issues were
p82
aVwith girls and boys and playing \u2014
p83
aVbecause, after all, that's really what this is about \u2014
p84
aVwe moved to the second phase of our work,
p85
aVwhere we interviewed adult experts
p86
aVin academia, some of the people
p87
aVwho'd produced the literature that we found relevant.
p88
aVAlso, we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day,
p89
aVlike playground supervisors. We talked to them,
p90
aVconfirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions
p91
aVabout gender difference and play.
p92
aa(lp93
VThen we did what I consider to be the heart of the work:
p94
aVinterviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls,
p95
aVages seven to 12, all over the United States \u2014
p96
aVexcept for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austin
p97
aVbecause we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them
p98
aVand they wouldn't be a representative sample.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd at the end of those remarkable conversations
p101
aVwith kids and their best friends across the United States,
p102
aVafter two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children,
p103
aVdrew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research,
p104
aVand spent another year transforming them into design heuristics,
p105
aVfor designing computer-based products \u2014
p106
aVand, in fact, any kind of products \u2014 for little girls, ages eight to 12.
p107
aVAnd we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software
p108
aVand testing them with little girls.
p109
aVIn 1996, in November, we formed the company Purple Moon
p110
aVwhich was a spinoff of Interval Research,
p111
aVand our chief investors were Interval Research, Vulcan Northwest,
p112
aVInstitutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company.
p113
aa(lp114
VWe launched a website on September 2nd
p115
aVthat has now served 25 million pages,
p116
aVand has 42,000 registered young girl users.
p117
aVThey visit an average of one and a half times a day,
p118
aVspend an average of 35 minutes a visit,
p119
aVand look at 50 pages a visit.
p120
aVSo we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls.
p121
aa(lp122
VWe launched two titles in October \u2014
p123
aV"Rockett's New School" \u2014 the first of a series
p124
aVof products \u2014 is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school
p125
aVin eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate,
p126
aVwhich allows girls to play with the question of, "What will I be like when I'm older?"
p127
aV"What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school?
p128
aVWho are my friends?";
p129
aVto exercise the love of social complexity
p130
aVand the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior;
p131
aVand which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices
p132
aVin our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest,"
p135
aVwhich addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls.
p136
aVThese two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data \u2014
p137
aVentertainment titles in PC Data
p138
aVin December, right up there with "John Madden Football,"
p139
aVwhich thrills me to death.
p140
aVSo, we're real,
p141
aVand we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls.
p142
aVWe've made half-a-billion impressions
p143
aVwith marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon.
p144
aVNinety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive;
p145
aVfour percent of them have been "other."
p146
aVI want to talk about the other,
p147
aVbecause the politics of this enterprise, in a way,
p148
aVhave been the most fascinating part of it, for me.
p149
aa(lp150
VThere are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received.
p151
aVOne kind of reviewer is a male gamer
p152
aVwho thinks he knows what games ought to be,
p153
aVand won't show the product to little girls.
p154
aVThe other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist
p155
aVwho thinks they know what little girls ought to be.
p156
aVAnd so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellows
p157
aVhave one thing in common:
p158
aVthey don't listen to little girls.
p159
aVThey haven't looked at children
p160
aVand they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them.
p161
aVI'd like to play you some voices of little girls
p162
aVfrom the two-and-a-half years of research that we did \u2014
p163
aVactually, some of the voices are more recent.
p164
aVAnd these voices will be accompanied by photographs
p165
aVthat they took for us of their lives,
p166
aVof the things that they value and care about.
p167
aVThese are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us
p168
aVThis is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to
p169
aVand this is the kind of research I recommend to those
p170
aVwho want to do humanistic work.
p171
aa(lp172
VGirl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.
p173
aVHers is more into boys.
p174
aa(lp175
VGirl 2: Uh, yeah.
p176
aa(lp177
VGirl 1: We have \u2014 in the very beginning of the whole game, always we do this:
p178
aVwe each have a piece of paper; we write down our name, our age \u2014
p179
aVare we rich, very rich, not rich, poor, medium, wealthy,
p180
aVboyfriends, dogs, pets \u2014 what else \u2014 sisters, brothers, and all those.
p181
aa(lp182
VGirl 2: Divorced \u2014 parents divorced, maybe.
p183
aa(lp184
VGirl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one.
p185
aa(lp186
VGirl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer.
p187
aa(lp188
VGirl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery
p189
aVwith clouds and flowers.
p190
aVGirl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy,
p191
aVyou would think that girls' games were kinda sissy.
p192
aa(lp193
VGirl 7: I run track, I played soccer,
p194
aVI play basketball, and I love a lot of things to do.
p195
aVAnd sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation,
p196
aVlike when I get Mondays and all those days off.
p197
aa(lp198
VGirl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on
p199
aVbecause I have music lessons and I'm on swim team \u2014
p200
aVall this different stuff that I have to do,
p201
aVand sometimes it gets overwhelming.
p202
aVGirl 9: My friend Justine
p203
aVkinda took my friend Kelly, and now they're being mean to me.
p204
aa(lp205
VGirl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters,
p206
aVor brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first
p207
aVand they take your idea and they do it themselves.
p208
aa(lp209
VGirl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everything
p210
aVand, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, "No" \u2014 all the time.
p211
aVBut she gives my sister everything.
p212
aa(lp213
VBrenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute
p214
aVof "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago.
p215
aVLet's hope it's really stable.
p216
aVThis is the second day in Rockett's life.
p217
aVThe reason I'm showing you this
p218
aVis I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar
p219
aVand sound familiar, now that you've listened to some girls' voices.
p220
aVAnd you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them
p221
aVin the game that we've created.
p222
aa(lp223
VMiko: Hey Rockett! C'mere!
p224
aa(lp225
VRockett: Hi Miko! What's going on?
p226
aa(lp227
VMiko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend?
p228
aVShe asked me to make sure you knew about it.
p229
aVNakilia invited Reuben too, but \u2014
p230
aa(lp231
VRockett: But what? Isn't he coming?
p232
aa(lp233
VMiko: I don't think so.
p234
aVI mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night.
p235
aa(lp236
VRockett: Really? What other party?
p237
aa(lp238
VGirl: Max's party is going to be so cool, Whitney.
p239
aVHe's invited all the best people.
p240
aa(lp241
VBL: I'm going to fast-forward to the decision point
p242
aVbecause I know I don't have a lot of time.
p243
aVAfter this awful event occurs, Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it.
p244
aa(lp245
VRockett: Who'd want to show up at that party anyway?
p246
aVI could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to.
p247
aVGee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list.
p248
aa(lp249
VBL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.
p250
aVIf we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.
p251
aVIf at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters,
p252
aVwe can go into this hidden hallway,
p253
aVand I'll quickly just show you the interface.
p254
aVWe can, for example, go find Miko's locker
p255
aVand get some more information about her.
p256
aVOops, I turned the wrong way.
p257
aVBut you get the general idea of the product.
p258
aa(lp259
VI wanted to show you the ways, innocuous as they seem,
p260
aVin which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls \u2014
p261
aVtheir desires to experience greater emotional flexibility,
p262
aVand to play around with the social complexity of their lives.
p263
aVI want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort,
p264
aVis a kind of validation,
p265
aVa sense of being seen.
p266
aVAnd a sense of the choices that are available in their lives.
p267
aVWe love them.
p268
aVWe see them.
p269
aVWe're not trying to tell them who they ought to be.
p270
aVBut we're really, really happy about who they are.
p271
aVIt turns out they're really great.
p272
aa(lp273
VI want to close by showing you a videotape
p274
aVthat's a version of a future game in the Rockett series
p275
aVthat our graphic artists and design people put together,
p276
aVthat we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.
p277
aV"Rockett 28!"
p278
aa(lp279
VRockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know?
p280
aa(lp281
VBL: Thanks.

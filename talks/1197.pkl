VCities are the crucible of civilization.
p5
aVThey have been expanding,
p6
aVurbanization has been expanding,
p7
aVat an exponential rate in the last 200 years
p8
aVso that by the second part of this century,
p9
aVthe planet will be completely dominated
p10
aVby cities.
p11
aVCities are the origins of global warming,
p12
aVimpact on the environment,
p13
aVhealth, pollution, disease,
p14
aVfinance,
p15
aVeconomies, energy \u2014
p16
aVthey're all problems
p17
aVthat are confronted by having cities.
p18
aVThat's where all these problems come from.
p19
aVAnd the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing
p20
aVin terms of sustainability questions
p21
aVare actually a reflection
p22
aVof the exponential increase
p23
aVin urbanization across the planet.
p24
aa(lp25
VHere's some numbers.
p26
aVTwo hundred years ago, the United States
p27
aVwas less than a few percent urbanized.
p28
aVIt's now more than 82 percent.
p29
aVThe planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.
p30
aVChina's building 300 new cities
p31
aVin the next 20 years.
p32
aVNow listen to this:
p33
aVEvery week for the foreseeable future,
p34
aVuntil 2050,
p35
aVevery week more than a million people
p36
aVare being added to our cities.
p37
aVThis is going to affect everything.
p38
aVEverybody in this room, if you stay alive,
p39
aVis going to be affected
p40
aVby what's happening in cities
p41
aVin this extraordinary phenomenon.
p42
aVHowever, cities,
p43
aVdespite having this negative aspect to them,
p44
aVare also the solution.
p45
aVBecause cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets
p46
aVthat have sucked up creative people,
p47
aVcreating ideas, innovation,
p48
aVwealth and so on.
p49
aVSo we have this kind of dual nature.
p50
aVAnd so there's an urgent need
p51
aVfor a scientific theory of cities.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow these are my comrades in arms.
p54
aVThis work has been done with an extraordinary group of people,
p55
aVand they've done all the work,
p56
aVand I'm the great bullshitter
p57
aVthat tries to bring it all together.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VSo here's the problem: This is what we all want.
p62
aVThe 10 billion people on the planet in 2050
p63
aVwant to live in places like this,
p64
aVhaving things like this,
p65
aVdoing things like this,
p66
aVwith economies that are growing like this,
p67
aVnot realizing that entropy
p68
aVproduces things like this,
p69
aVthis, this
p70
aVand this.
p71
aVAnd the question is:
p72
aVIs that what Edinburgh and London and New York
p73
aVare going to look like in 2050,
p74
aVor is it going to be this?
p75
aVThat's the question.
p76
aVI must say, many of the indicators
p77
aVlook like this is what it's going to look like,
p78
aVbut let's talk about it.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo my provocative statement
p81
aVis that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.
p82
aVAnd scientific theory means quantifiable \u2014
p83
aVrelying on underlying generic principles
p84
aVthat can be made into a predictive framework.
p85
aVThat's the quest.
p86
aVIs that conceivable?
p87
aVAre there universal laws?
p88
aVSo here's two questions
p89
aVthat I have in my head when I think about this problem.
p90
aVThe first is:
p91
aVAre cities part of biology?
p92
aVIs London a great big whale?
p93
aVIs Edinburgh a horse?
p94
aVIs Microsoft a great big anthill?
p95
aVWhat do we learn from that?
p96
aVWe use them metaphorically \u2014
p97
aVthe DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on \u2014
p98
aVis that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit,
p99
aVor is there serious substance to it?
p100
aVAnd if that is the case,
p101
aVhow come that it's very hard to kill a city?
p102
aVYou could drop an atom bomb on a city,
p103
aVand 30 years later it's surviving.
p104
aVVery few cities fail.
p105
aVAll companies die, all companies.
p106
aVAnd if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict
p107
aVwhen Google is going to go bust.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo is that just another version
p110
aVof this?
p111
aVWell we understand this very well.
p112
aVThat is, you ask any generic question about this \u2014
p113
aVhow many trees of a given size,
p114
aVhow many branches of a given size does a tree have,
p115
aVhow many leaves,
p116
aVwhat is the energy flowing through each branch,
p117
aVwhat is the size of the canopy,
p118
aVwhat is its growth, what is its mortality?
p119
aVWe have a mathematical framework
p120
aVbased on generic universal principles
p121
aVthat can answer those questions.
p122
aVAnd the idea is can we do the same for this?
p123
aVSo the route in is recognizing
p124
aVone of the most extraordinary things about life,
p125
aVis that it is scalable,
p126
aVit works over an extraordinary range.
p127
aVThis is just a tiny range actually:
p128
aVIt's us mammals;
p129
aVwe're one of these.
p130
aVThe same principles, the same dynamics,
p131
aVthe same organization is at work
p132
aVin all of these, including us,
p133
aVand it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.
p134
aVAnd that is one of the main reasons
p135
aVlife is so resilient and robust \u2014
p136
aVscalability.
p137
aVWe're going to discuss that in a moment more.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut you know, at a local level,
p140
aVyou scale; everybody in this room is scaled.
p141
aVThat's called growth.
p142
aVHere's how you grew.
p143
aVRat, that's a rat \u2014 could have been you.
p144
aVWe're all pretty much the same.
p145
aVAnd you see, you're very familiar with this.
p146
aVYou grow very quickly and then you stop.
p147
aVAnd that line there
p148
aVis a prediction from the same theory,
p149
aVbased on the same principles,
p150
aVthat describes that forest.
p151
aVAnd here it is for the growth of a rat,
p152
aVand those points on there are data points.
p153
aVThis is just the weight versus the age.
p154
aVAnd you see, it stops growing.
p155
aVVery, very good for biology \u2014
p156
aValso one of the reasons for its great resilience.
p157
aVVery, very bad
p158
aVfor economies and companies and cities
p159
aVin our present paradigm.
p160
aVThis is what we believe.
p161
aVThis is what our whole economy
p162
aVis thrusting upon us,
p163
aVparticularly illustrated in that left-hand corner:
p164
aVhockey sticks.
p165
aVThis is a bunch of software companies \u2014
p166
aVand what it is is their revenue versus their age \u2014
p167
aVall zooming away,
p168
aVand everybody making millions and billions of dollars.
p169
aa(lp170
VOkay, so how do we understand this?
p171
aVSo let's first talk about biology.
p172
aVThis is explicitly showing you
p173
aVhow things scale,
p174
aVand this is a truly remarkable graph.
p175
aVWhat is plotted here is metabolic rate \u2014
p176
aVhow much energy you need per day to stay alive \u2014
p177
aVversus your weight, your mass,
p178
aVfor all of us bunch of organisms.
p179
aVAnd it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10,
p180
aVotherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph.
p181
aVAnd what you see if you plot it
p182
aVin this slightly curious way
p183
aVis that everybody lies on the same line.
p184
aVDespite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system
p185
aVin the universe,
p186
aVthere's an extraordinary simplicity
p187
aVbeing expressed by this.
p188
aVIt's particularly astonishing
p189
aVbecause each one of these organisms,
p190
aVeach subsystem, each cell type, each gene,
p191
aVhas evolved in its own unique environmental niche
p192
aVwith its own unique history.
p193
aVAnd yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution
p194
aVand natural selection,
p195
aVthey've been constrained to lie on a line.
p196
aa(lp197
VSomething else is going on.
p198
aVBefore I talk about that,
p199
aVI've written down at the bottom there
p200
aVthe slope of this curve, this straight line.
p201
aVIt's three-quarters, roughly,
p202
aVwhich is less than one \u2014 and we call that sublinear.
p203
aVAnd here's the point of that.
p204
aVIt says that, if it were linear,
p205
aVthe steepest slope,
p206
aVthen doubling the size
p207
aVyou would require double the amount of energy.
p208
aVBut it's sublinear, and what that translates into
p209
aVis that, if you double the size of the organism,
p210
aVyou actually only need 75 percent more energy.
p211
aVSo a wonderful thing about all of biology
p212
aVis that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.
p213
aVThe bigger you are systematically,
p214
aVaccording to very well-defined rules,
p215
aVless energy per capita.
p216
aVNow any physiological variable you can think of,
p217
aVany life history event you can think of,
p218
aVif you plot it this way, looks like this.
p219
aVThere is an extraordinary regularity.
p220
aVSo you tell me the size of a mammal,
p221
aVI can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it
p222
aVin terms of its physiology, life history, etc.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd the reason for this is because of networks.
p225
aVAll of life is controlled by networks \u2014
p226
aVfrom the intracellular through the multicellular
p227
aVthrough the ecosystem level.
p228
aVAnd you're very familiar with these networks.
p229
aVThat's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.
p230
aVAnd here's the summary of what I'm saying.
p231
aVIf you take those networks,
p232
aVthis idea of networks,
p233
aVand you apply universal principles,
p234
aVmathematizable, universal principles,
p235
aVall of these scalings
p236
aVand all of these constraints follow,
p237
aVincluding the description of the forest,
p238
aVthe description of your circulatory system,
p239
aVthe description within cells.
p240
aVOne of the things I did not stress in that introduction
p241
aVwas that, systematically, the pace of life
p242
aVdecreases as you get bigger.
p243
aVHeart rates are slower; you live longer;
p244
aVdiffusion of oxygen and resources
p245
aVacross membranes is slower, etc.
p246
aa(lp247
VThe question is: Is any of this true
p248
aVfor cities and companies?
p249
aVSo is London a scaled up Birmingham,
p250
aVwhich is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.?
p251
aVIs New York a scaled up San Francisco,
p252
aVwhich is a scaled up Santa Fe?
p253
aVDon't know. We will discuss that.
p254
aVBut they are networks,
p255
aVand the most important network of cities
p256
aVis you.
p257
aVCities are just a physical manifestation
p258
aVof your interactions,
p259
aVour interactions,
p260
aVand the clustering and grouping of individuals.
p261
aVHere's just a symbolic picture of that.
p262
aVAnd here's scaling of cities.
p263
aVThis shows that in this very simple example,
p264
aVwhich happens to be a mundane example
p265
aVof number of petrol stations
p266
aVas a function of size \u2014
p267
aVplotted in the same way as the biology \u2014
p268
aVyou see exactly the same kind of thing.
p269
aa(lp270
VThere is a scaling.
p271
aVThat is that the number of petrol stations in the city
p272
aVis now given to you
p273
aVwhen you tell me its size.
p274
aVThe slope of that is less than linear.
p275
aVThere is an economy of scale.
p276
aVLess petrol stations per capita the bigger you are \u2014 not surprising.
p277
aVBut here's what's surprising.
p278
aVIt scales in the same way everywhere.
p279
aVThis is just European countries,
p280
aVbut you do it in Japan or China or Colombia,
p281
aValways the same
p282
aVwith the same kind of economy of scale
p283
aVto the same degree.
p284
aVAnd any infrastructure you look at \u2014
p285
aVwhether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines \u2014
p286
aVanything you look at
p287
aVhas the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.
p288
aVIt's an integrated system
p289
aVthat has evolved despite all the planning and so on.
p290
aVBut even more surprising
p291
aVis if you look at socio-economic quantities,
p292
aVquantities that have no analog in biology,
p293
aVthat have evolved when we started forming communities
p294
aVeight to 10,000 years ago.
p295
aVThe top one is wages as a function of size
p296
aVplotted in the same way.
p297
aVAnd the bottom one is you lot \u2014
p298
aVsuper-creatives plotted in the same way.
p299
aVAnd what you see
p300
aVis a scaling phenomenon.
p301
aVBut most important in this,
p302
aVthe exponent, the analog to that three-quarters
p303
aVfor the metabolic rate,
p304
aVis bigger than one \u2014 it's about 1.15 to 1.2.
p305
aVHere it is,
p306
aVwhich says that the bigger you are
p307
aVthe more you have per capita, unlike biology \u2014
p308
aVhigher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger,
p309
aVmore patents per capita, more crime per capita.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd we've looked at everything:
p312
aVmore AIDS cases, flu, etc.
p313
aVAnd here, they're all plotted together.
p314
aVJust to show you what we plotted,
p315
aVhere is income, GDP \u2014
p316
aVGDP of the city \u2014
p317
aVcrime and patents all on one graph.
p318
aVAnd you can see, they all follow the same line.
p319
aVAnd here's the statement.
p320
aVIf you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000,
p321
aVfrom a million to two million, 10 to 20 million,
p322
aVit doesn't matter,
p323
aVthen systematically
p324
aVyou get a 15 percent increase
p325
aVin wages, wealth, number of AIDS cases,
p326
aVnumber of police,
p327
aVanything you can think of.
p328
aVIt goes up by 15 percent,
p329
aVand you have a 15 percent savings
p330
aVon the infrastructure.
p331
aVThis, no doubt, is the reason
p332
aVwhy a million people a week are gathering in cities.
p333
aVBecause they think that all those wonderful things \u2014
p334
aVlike creative people, wealth, income \u2014
p335
aVis what attracts them,
p336
aVforgetting about the ugly and the bad.
p337
aa(lp338
VWhat is the reason for this?
p339
aVWell I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics,
p340
aVbut underlying this is the social networks,
p341
aVbecause this is a universal phenomenon.
p342
aVThis 15 percent rule
p343
aVis true
p344
aVno matter where you are on the planet \u2014
p345
aVJapan, Chile,
p346
aVPortugal, Scotland, doesn't matter.
p347
aVAlways, all the data shows it's the same,
p348
aVdespite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.
p349
aVSomething universal is going on.
p350
aVThe universality, to repeat, is us \u2014
p351
aVthat we are the city.
p352
aVAnd it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions.
p353
aVSo there it is, I've said it again.
p354
aVSo if it is those networks and their mathematical structure,
p355
aVunlike biology, which had sublinear scaling,
p356
aVeconomies of scale,
p357
aVyou had the slowing of the pace of life
p358
aVas you get bigger.
p359
aVIf it's social networks with super-linear scaling \u2014
p360
aVmore per capita \u2014
p361
aVthen the theory says
p362
aVthat you increase the pace of life.
p363
aVThe bigger you are, life gets faster.
p364
aVOn the left is the heart rate showing biology.
p365
aVOn the right is the speed of walking
p366
aVin a bunch of European cities,
p367
aVshowing that increase.
p368
aa(lp369
VLastly, I want to talk about growth.
p370
aVThis is what we had in biology, just to repeat.
p371
aVEconomies of scale
p372
aVgave rise to this sigmoidal behavior.
p373
aVYou grow fast and then stop \u2014
p374
aVpart of our resilience.
p375
aVThat would be bad for economies and cities.
p376
aVAnd indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory
p377
aVis that if you have super-linear scaling
p378
aVfrom wealth creation and innovation,
p379
aVthen indeed you get, from the same theory,
p380
aVa beautiful rising exponential curve \u2014 lovely.
p381
aVAnd in fact, if you compare it to data,
p382
aVit fits very well
p383
aVwith the development of cities and economies.
p384
aVBut it has a terrible catch,
p385
aVand the catch
p386
aVis that this system is destined to collapse.
p387
aVAnd it's destined to collapse for many reasons \u2014
p388
aVkind of Malthusian reasons \u2014 that you run out of resources.
p389
aVAnd how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before.
p390
aa(lp391
VWhat we do is,
p392
aVas we grow and we approach the collapse,
p393
aVa major innovation takes place
p394
aVand we start over again,
p395
aVand we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on.
p396
aVSo there's this continuous cycle of innovation
p397
aVthat is necessary
p398
aVin order to sustain growth and avoid collapse.
p399
aVThe catch, however, to this
p400
aVis that you have to innovate
p401
aVfaster and faster and faster.
p402
aVSo the image
p403
aVis that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster,
p404
aVbut we have to change the treadmill faster and faster.
p405
aVWe have to accelerate on a continuous basis.
p406
aVAnd the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings,
p407
aVavoid a heart attack?
p408
aa(lp409
VSo lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two
p410
aVasking about companies.
p411
aVSee companies, they scale.
p412
aVThe top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.
p413
aVIt's the same plot.
p414
aVThis happens to be income and assets
p415
aVversus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.
p416
aVWe could use sales, anything you like.
p417
aVThere it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,
p418
aVwhen companies are innovating,
p419
aVthey scale beautifully.
p420
aVAnd we've looked at 23,000 companies
p421
aVin the United States, may I say.
p422
aVAnd I'm only showing you a little bit of this.
p423
aa(lp424
VWhat is astonishing about companies
p425
aVis that they scale sublinearly
p426
aVlike biology,
p427
aVindicating that they're dominated,
p428
aVnot by super-linear
p429
aVinnovation and ideas;
p430
aVthey become dominated
p431
aVby economies of scale.
p432
aVIn that interpretation,
p433
aVby bureaucracy and administration,
p434
aVand they do it beautifully, may I say.
p435
aVSo if you tell me the size of some company, some small company,
p436
aVI could have predicted the size of Walmart.
p437
aVIf it has this sublinear scaling,
p438
aVthe theory says
p439
aVwe should have sigmoidal growth.
p440
aVThere's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.
p441
aVThat's what we like, hockey sticks.
p442
aVBut you notice, I've cheated,
p443
aVbecause I've only gone up to '94.
p444
aVLet's go up to 2008.
p445
aVThat red line is from the theory.
p446
aVSo if I'd have done this in 1994,
p447
aVI could have predicted what Walmart would be now.
p448
aVAnd then this is repeated
p449
aVacross the entire spectrum of companies.
p450
aVThere they are. That's 23,000 companies.
p451
aVThey all start looking like hockey sticks,
p452
aVthey all bend over,
p453
aVand they all die like you and me.
p454
aa(lp455
VThank you.

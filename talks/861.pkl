VI want to talk about penguins today.
p5
aVBut first, I want to start by saying that
p6
aVwe need a new operating system,
p7
aVfor the oceans and for the Earth.
p8
aVWhen I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago,
p9
aVthere were 3,000 people
p10
aVthat lived in the Galapagos.
p11
aVNow there are over 30,000.
p12
aVThere were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz.
p13
aVNow, there are around a thousand trucks
p14
aVand buses and cars there.
p15
aVSo the fundamental problems that we face
p16
aVare overconsumption and too many people.
p17
aVIt's the same problems in the Galapagos,
p18
aVexcept, obviously,
p19
aVit's worse here, in some ways, than other places.
p20
aVBecause we've only doubled the population of the Earth
p21
aVsince the 1960s \u2014 a little more than doubled \u2014
p22
aVbut we have 6.7 billion people in the world,
p23
aVand we all like to consume.
p24
aVAnd one of the major problems that we have
p25
aVis our operating system
p26
aVis not giving us the proper feedback.
p27
aVWe're not paying the true
p28
aVenvironmental costs of our actions.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina,
p31
aVlet me just say, that I had never
p32
aVcamped before.
p33
aVI had never lived alone
p34
aVfor any period of time,
p35
aVand I'd never slept with sea lions
p36
aVsnoring next to me all night.
p37
aVBut moreover, I'd never lived on an uninhabited island.
p38
aVPunta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year,
p39
aVand we call it uninhabited
p40
aVbecause there are no people there.
p41
aVBut it's alive with life;
p42
aVit's hardly uninhabited.
p43
aVSo a lot has happened in the last 40 years,
p44
aa(lp45
Vand what I learned when I came to the Galapagos
p46
aVis the importance of wild places, wild things,
p47
aVcertainly wildlife,
p48
aVand the amazing qualities that penguins have.
p49
aVPenguins are real athletes:
p50
aVThey can swim 173 kilometers in a day.
p51
aVThey can swim at the same speed day and night \u2014
p52
aVthat's faster than any Olympic swimmer.
p53
aVI mean, they can do like seven kilometers an hour
p54
aVand sustain it.
p55
aVBut what is really amazing, because of this deepness here,
p56
aVEmperor penguins can go down
p57
aVmore than 500 meters
p58
aVand they can hold their breath for 23 minutes.
p59
aVMagellanic penguins, the ones that I work on,
p60
aVthey can dive to about 90 meters
p61
aVand they can stay down for
p62
aVabout 4.6 minutes.
p63
aVHumans, without fins: 90 meters, 3.5 minutes.
p64
aVAnd I doubt anybody in this room
p65
aVcould really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes.
p66
aVYou have to train to be able to do that.
p67
aVSo penguins are amazing athletes.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe other thing is, I've never met anybody
p70
aVthat really doesn't say that they like penguins.
p71
aVThey're comical, they walk upright,
p72
aVand, of course, they're diligent.
p73
aVAnd, more importantly, they're well-dressed.
p74
aVSo they have all the criteria
p75
aVthat people normally like.
p76
aVBut scientifically, they're amazing because they're sentinels.
p77
aVThey tell us about our world in a lot of different ways,
p78
aVand particularly the ocean.
p79
aa(lp80
VThis is a picture of a Galapagos penguin
p81
aVthat's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos.
p82
aVAnd that's what I came to study.
p83
aVI thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins,
p84
aVbut you already know
p85
aVpenguins are rare.
p86
aVThese are the rarest penguins in the world.
p87
aVWhy I thought I was going to be able to do that, I don't know.
p88
aVBut the population has changed
p89
aVdramatically since I was first here.
p90
aVWhen I counted penguins for the first time
p91
aVand tried to do a census,
p92
aVwe just counted all the individual beaks that we could
p93
aVaround all these islands.
p94
aVWe counted around 2,000, so I don't know how many penguins there really are,
p95
aVbut I know I can count 2,000.
p96
aVIf you go and do it now, the national parks
p97
aVcount about 500.
p98
aVSo we have a quarter of the penguins
p99
aVthat we did 40 years ago.
p100
aVAnd this is true of most of our living systems.
p101
aVWe have less than we had before,
p102
aVand most of them are in fairly steep decline.
p103
aVAnd I want to just show you a little bit about why.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Braying)
p106
aa(lp107
VThat's a penguin braying
p108
aVto tell you that
p109
aVit's important to pay attention to penguins.
p110
aVMost important of all,
p111
aVI didn't know what that was the first time I heard it.
p112
aVAnd you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there
p113
aVand you hear this lonesome, plaintful call.
p114
aVI fell in love with penguins,
p115
aVand it certainly has changed the rest of my life.
p116
aVWhat I found out I was studying
p117
aVis really the difference in how the Galapagos changes,
p118
aVthe most extreme variation.
p119
aVYou've heard about these El Ninos,
p120
aVbut this is the extreme that penguins all over the world
p121
aVhave to adapt to.
p122
aVThis is a cold-water event
p123
aVcalled La Nina.
p124
aVWhere it's blue and it's green, it means the water is really cold.
p125
aVAnd so you can see this current coming up \u2014
p126
aVin this case, the Humboldt Current \u2014
p127
aVthat comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands,
p128
aVand this deep undersea current, the Cromwell Current,
p129
aVthat upwells around the Galapagos.
p130
aVThat brings all the nutrients:
p131
aVWhen this is cold in the Galapagos,
p132
aVit's rich, and there's plenty of food for everyone.
p133
aa(lp134
VWhen we have extreme El Nino events,
p135
aVyou see all this red,
p136
aVand you see no green
p137
aVout here around the Galapagos.
p138
aVThat means that there's no upwelling,
p139
aVand there's basically no food.
p140
aVSo it's a real desert
p141
aVfor not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...
p142
aVthings die when there's no food.
p143
aVBut we didn't even know that that
p144
aVaffected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins.
p145
aVAnd you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins,
p146
aVand you're in the middle of an El Nino event
p147
aVand there are no penguins.
p148
aVThey're not breeding; they're not even around.
p149
aVI studied marine iguanas at that point.
p150
aVBut this is a global phenomenon, we know that.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now,
p153
aVat a place called Punta Tombo \u2014
p154
aVthe largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world
p155
aVdown here about 44 degrees south latitude \u2014
p156
aVyou see that there's great variation here.
p157
aVSome years, the cold water
p158
aVgoes all the way up to Brazil,
p159
aVand other years, in these La Nina years, it doesn't.
p160
aVSo the oceans don't always act together; they act differently,
p161
aVbut that is the kind of variation
p162
aVthat penguins have to live with,
p163
aVand it's not easy.
p164
aVSo when I went to study the Magellanic penguins,
p165
aVI didn't have any problems.
p166
aVThere were plenty of them.
p167
aa(lp168
VThis is a picture at Punta Tombo in February
p169
aVshowing all the penguins along the beach.
p170
aVI went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them
p171
aVand turning them into high fashion golf gloves,
p172
aVprotein and oil.
p173
aVFortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins
p174
aVand we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.
p175
aVBut the population is declining
p176
aVand it's declined fairly substantially, about 21 percent
p177
aVsince 1987, when I started these surveys,
p178
aVin terms of number of active nests.
p179
aVHere, you can see where Punta Tombo is,
p180
aVand they breed in incredibly dense colonies.
p181
aVWe know this because of long-term science,
p182
aVbecause we have long-term studies there.
p183
aVAnd science is important in informing decision makers,
p184
aVand also in changing how we do
p185
aVand knowing the direction of change that we're going in.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd so we have this penguin project. The Wildlife Conservation Society
p188
aVhas funded me along with a lot of individuals
p189
aVover the last 27 years
p190
aVto be able to produce these kinds of maps.
p191
aVAnd also, we know that it's not only
p192
aVGalapagos penguins that are in trouble,
p193
aVbut Magellanics and many other species of penguins.
p194
aVAnd so we have started a global penguin society
p195
aVto try to focus on the real plight of penguins.
p196
aVThis is one of the plights of penguins: oil pollution.
p197
aVPenguins don't like oil
p198
aVand they don't like to swim through oil.
p199
aVThe nice thing is, if you look down here in Argentina,
p200
aVthere's no surface oil pollution from this composite map.
p201
aVBut, in fact, when we went to Argentina,
p202
aVpenguins were often found
p203
aVtotally covered in oil.
p204
aVSo they were just minding their own business.
p205
aVThey ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it.
p206
aVBecause when tankers carry oil
p207
aVthey have to have ballast at some point,
p208
aVso when they're empty, they have the ballast water in there.
p209
aVWhen they come back, they actually dump
p210
aVthis oily ballast water into the ocean.
p211
aVWhy do they do that? Because it's cheaper,
p212
aVbecause they don't pay the real environmental costs.
p213
aVWe usually don't, and we want to start
p214
aVgetting the accounting system right
p215
aVso we can pay the real cost.
p216
aa(lp217
VAt first, the Argentine government said, "No, there's no way.
p218
aVYou can't find oiled penguins in Argentina.
p219
aVWe have laws,
p220
aVand we can't have illegal dumping; it's against the law."
p221
aVSo we ended up spending nine years
p222
aVconvincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins.
p223
aVIn some years, like this year, we found
p224
aVmore than 80 percent
p225
aVof the adult penguins dead on the beach
p226
aVwere covered in oil.
p227
aVThese little blue dots are the fledglings \u2014
p228
aVwe do this survey every March \u2014
p229
aVwhich means that they're only in the environment
p230
aVfrom January until March,
p231
aVso maybe three months at the most
p232
aVthat they could get covered in oil.
p233
aVAnd you can see, in some years over 60 percent
p234
aVof the fledglings were oiled.
p235
aa(lp236
VEventually, the government listened
p237
aVand, amazingly, they changed their laws.
p238
aVThey moved the tanker lanes
p239
aV40 kilometers farther off shore,
p240
aVand people are not doing as much illegal dumping.
p241
aVSo what we're seeing now
p242
aVis very few penguins are oiled.
p243
aVWhy are there even these penguins oiled?
p244
aVBecause we've solved the problem in Chubut province,
p245
aVwhich is like a state in Argentina
p246
aVwhere Punta Tombo is \u2014
p247
aVso that's about 1,000 kilometers of coastline \u2014
p248
aVbut we haven't solved the problem
p249
aVin northern Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.
p250
aVSo now I want to show you that penguins are affected.
p251
aa(lp252
VI'm just going to talk about two things.
p253
aVThis is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study
p254
aVbecause I put satellite tags on the back
p255
aVof these Magellanic penguins.
p256
aVTry to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars
p257
aVto glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins.
p258
aVBut we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go.
p259
aVWe thought we needed a marine protected area
p260
aVof about 30 kilometers,
p261
aVand then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin.
p262
aVAnd what the penguins show us \u2014
p263
aVand these are all the little dots
p264
aVfrom where the penguins' positions were
p265
aVfor penguins in incubation in 2003 \u2014
p266
aVand what you see is some of these individuals
p267
aVare going 800 kilometers away from their nests.
p268
aVSo that means as their mate
p269
aVis sitting on the nest incubating the eggs,
p270
aVthe other one is out there foraging,
p271
aVand the longer they have to stay gone,
p272
aVthe worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back.
p273
aVAnd, of course, all of this then leads to a vicious cycle
p274
aVand you can't raise a lot of chicks.
p275
aa(lp276
VHere you see in 2003 \u2014
p277
aVthese are all the dots of where the penguins are \u2014
p278
aVthey were raising a little over
p279
aVa half of a chick.
p280
aVHere, you can see in 2006,
p281
aVthey raised almost three quarters
p282
aVof a chick per nest,
p283
aVand you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo;
p284
aVthey're not going as far away.
p285
aVThis past year, in 2009,
p286
aVyou can see that they're now raising
p287
aVabout a fourth of a chick,
p288
aVand some of these individuals are going
p289
aVmore than 900 kilometers away from their nests.
p290
aVSo it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago,
p291
aVand then you get transferred
p292
aVto St. Louis,
p293
aVand your mate is not happy about this
p294
aVbecause you've got to pay airfare,
p295
aVbecause you're gone longer.
p296
aVThe same thing's true for penguins as well.
p297
aVAnd they're going about, on average now,
p298
aV40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago.
p299
aa(lp300
VWe need to be able to get information out to the general public.
p301
aVAnd so we started a publication
p302
aVwith the Society for Conservation
p303
aVthat we think presents cutting-edge science
p304
aVin a new, novel way,
p305
aVbecause we have reporters that are good writers
p306
aVthat actually can distill the information
p307
aVand make it accessible to the general public.
p308
aVSo if you're interested in cutting-edge science
p309
aVand smarter conservation,
p310
aVyou should join with our 11 partners \u2014
p311
aVsome of them here in this room, like the Nature Conservancy \u2014
p312
aVand look at this magazine
p313
aVbecause we need to get information out about conservation
p314
aVto the general public.
p315
aa(lp316
VLastly I want to say that
p317
aVall of you, probably,
p318
aVhave had some relationship at some time in your life
p319
aVwith a dog, a cat, some sort of pet,
p320
aVand you recognized that those are individuals.
p321
aVAnd some of you consider them almost part of your family.
p322
aVIf you had a relationship with a penguin,
p323
aVyou'd see it in the same sort of way.
p324
aVThey're amazing creatures
p325
aVthat really change how you view the world
p326
aVbecause they're not that different from us:
p327
aVThey're trying to make a living,
p328
aVthey're trying to raise their offspring,
p329
aVthey're trying to get on and survive in the world.
p330
aa(lp331
VThis is Turbo the Penguin.
p332
aVTurbo's never been fed.
p333
aVHe met us and got his name
p334
aVbecause he started standing under
p335
aVmy diesel truck: a turbo truck,
p336
aVso we named him Turbo.
p337
aVTurbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak,
p338
aVwe let him in and he comes in here.
p339
aVAnd I just wanted to show you
p340
aVwhat happened one day
p341
aVwhen Turbo brought in a friend.
p342
aVSo this is Turbo.
p343
aVHe's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting,
p344
aVwhich he would do to a female penguin.
p345
aVAnd you can see, he's not trying to bite.
p346
aVThis guy has never been in before
p347
aVand he's trying to figure out, "What is going on?
p348
aVWhat is this guy doing?
p349
aVThis is really pretty weird."
p350
aVAnd you'll see soon
p351
aVthat my graduate student ...
p352
aVand you see, Turbo's pretty intent
p353
aVon his flipper patting.
p354
aVAnd now he's looking at the other guy,
p355
aVsaying, "You are really weird."
p356
aVAnd now look at this: not friendly.
p357
aVSo penguins really differ in their personalities
p358
aVjust like our dogs and our cats.
p359
aa(lp360
VWe're also trying to collect our information
p361
aVand become more technologically literate.
p362
aVSo we're trying to put that
p363
aVin computers in the field.
p364
aVAnd penguins are always involved in helping us
p365
aVor not helping us in one way or another.
p366
aVThis is a radio frequency ID system.
p367
aVYou put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin
p368
aVthat has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.
p369
aVIt walks over the pad, and you know who it is.
p370
aa(lp371
VOkay, so here are a few penguins coming in.
p372
aVSee, this one's coming back to its nest.
p373
aVThey're all coming in at this time,
p374
aVwalking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in.
p375
aVHere's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food.
p376
aVShe's really rushing back, because it's hot,
p377
aVto try to feed her chicks.
p378
aVAnd then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by.
p379
aVLook how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks.
p380
aVThen I realize that they're playing
p381
aVking of the box.
p382
aVThis is my box up here, and this is the system that works.
p383
aVYou can see this penguin, he goes over, he looks at those wires,
p384
aVdoes not like that wire.
p385
aVHe unplugs the wire; we have no data.
p386
aa(lp387
V(Laughter)
p388
aa(lp389
VSo, they really are pretty amazing creatures.
p390
aVOK.
p391
aVMost important thing is:
p392
aVOnly you can change yourself,
p393
aVand only you can change the world
p394
aVand make it better, for people
p395
aVas well as penguins.
p396
aa(lp397
VSo, thank you very much. (Applause)

VLet me tell you a story
p5
aVabout a little girl named Naghma.
p6
aVNaghma lived in a refugee camp
p7
aVwith her parents and her eight brothers and sisters.
p8
aVEvery morning, her father would wake up
p9
aVin the hopes he'd be picked for construction work,
p10
aVand on a good month he would earn 50 dollars.
p11
aVThe winter was very harsh,
p12
aVand unfortunately, Naghma's brother died
p13
aVand her mother became very ill.
p14
aVIn desperation, her father went to a neighbor
p15
aVto borrow 2,500 dollars.
p16
aVAfter several months of waiting,
p17
aVthe neighbor became very impatient,
p18
aVand he demanded that he be paid back.
p19
aVUnfortunately, Naghma's father didn't have the money,
p20
aVand so the two men agreed to a jirga.
p21
aVSo simply put, a jirga is a form of mediation
p22
aVthat's used in Afghanistan's  informal justice system.
p23
aVIt's usually presided over by religious leaders
p24
aVand village elders,
p25
aVand jirgas are often used in rural countries like Afghanistan,
p26
aVwhere there's deep-seated resentment
p27
aVagainst the formal system.
p28
aVAt the jirga, the men sat together
p29
aVand they decided that the  best way to satisfy the debt
p30
aVwould be if Naghma married the neighbor's 21-year-old son.
p31
aVShe was six.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, stories like Naghma's unfortunately
p34
aVare all too common,
p35
aVand from the comforts of our home,
p36
aVwe may look at these stories as another
p37
aVcrushing blow to women's rights.
p38
aVAnd if you watched Afghanistan on the news,
p39
aVyou may have this view that it's a failed state.
p40
aVHowever, Afghanistan does have a legal system,
p41
aVand while jirgas are built on long-standing tribal customs,
p42
aVeven in jirgas, laws are supposed to be followed,
p43
aVand it goes without saying
p44
aVthat giving a child to satisfy a debt
p45
aVis not only grossly immoral, it's illegal.
p46
aa(lp47
VIn 2008, I went to Afghanistan
p48
aVfor a justice funded program,
p49
aVand I went there originally  on this nine-month program
p50
aVto train Afghan lawyers.
p51
aVIn that nine months, I went around the country
p52
aVand I talked to hundreds of people that were locked up,
p53
aVand I talked to many businesses
p54
aVthat were also operating in Afghanistan.
p55
aVAnd within these conversations,
p56
aVI started hearing the connections
p57
aVbetween the businesses and the people,
p58
aVand how laws that were meant to protect them
p59
aVwere being underused,
p60
aVwhile gross and illegal punitive measures were overused.
p61
aVAnd so this put me on a quest for justness,
p62
aVand what justness means to me
p63
aVis using laws for their intended purpose,
p64
aVwhich is to protect.
p65
aVThe role of laws is to protect.
p66
aVSo as a result, I decided to  open up a private practice,
p67
aVand I became the first foreigner to litigate
p68
aVin Afghan courts.
p69
aVThroughout this time, I also studied many laws,
p70
aVI talked to many people,
p71
aVI read up on many cases,
p72
aVand I found that the lack of justness
p73
aVis not just a problem in Afghanistan,
p74
aVbut it's a global problem.
p75
aVAnd while I originally shied away from
p76
aVrepresenting human rights cases
p77
aVbecause I was really concerned about how it would
p78
aVaffect me both professionally and personally,
p79
aVI decided that the need for justness was so great
p80
aVthat I couldn't continue to ignore it.
p81
aVAnd so I started representing people like Naghma
p82
aVpro bono also.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, since I've been in Afghanistan
p85
aVand since I've been an attorney for over 10 years,
p86
aVI've represented from CEOs  of Fortune 500 companies
p87
aVto ambassadors to little girls like Naghma,
p88
aVand with much success.
p89
aVAnd the reason for my success is very simple:
p90
aVI work the system from the inside out
p91
aVand use the laws in the ways
p92
aVthat they're intended to be used.
p93
aa(lp94
VI find that
p95
aVachieving justness in places like Afghanistan
p96
aVis difficult, and there's three reasons.
p97
aVThe first reason is that simply put,
p98
aVpeople are very uneducated as to what their legal rights were,
p99
aVand I find that this is a global problem.
p100
aVThe second issue
p101
aVis that even with laws on the books,
p102
aVit's often superseded or ignored
p103
aVby tribal customs, like in the first jirga
p104
aVthat sold Naghma off.
p105
aVAnd the third problem with achieving justness
p106
aVis that even with good, existing laws on the books,
p107
aVthere aren't people or lawyers  that are willing to fight
p108
aVfor those laws.
p109
aVAnd that's what I do: I use existing laws,
p110
aVoften unused laws,
p111
aVand I work those to the benefits of my clients.
p112
aVWe all need to create a global culture
p113
aVof human rights
p114
aVand be investors in a global  human rights economy,
p115
aVand by working in this mindset,
p116
aVwe can significantly improve justice globally.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow let's get back to Naghma.
p119
aVSeveral people heard about this story,
p120
aVand so they contacted me because they wanted
p121
aVto pay the $2,500 debt.
p122
aVAnd it's not just that simple;
p123
aVyou can't just throw money at this problem
p124
aVand think that it's going to disappear.
p125
aVThat's not how it works in Afghanistan.
p126
aVSo I told them I'd get involved,
p127
aVbut in order to get involved,  what needed to happen
p128
aVis a second jirga needed to be called,
p129
aVa jirga of appeals.
p130
aVAnd so in order for that to happen,
p131
aVwe needed to get the village elders together,
p132
aVwe needed to get the tribal leaders together,
p133
aVthe religious leaders.
p134
aVNaghma's father needed to agree,
p135
aVthe neighbor needed to agree,
p136
aVand also his son needed to agree.
p137
aVAnd I thought, if I'm going to  get involved in this thing,
p138
aVthen they also need to agree  that I preside over it.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo, after hours of talking
p141
aVand tracking them down,
p142
aVand about 30 cups of tea,
p143
aVthey finally agreed that we could sit down
p144
aVfor a second jirga, and we did.
p145
aVAnd what was different about the second jirga
p146
aVis this time, we put the law at the center of it,
p147
aVand it was very important for me
p148
aVthat they all understood that Naghma
p149
aVhad a right to be protected.
p150
aVAnd at the end of this jirga,
p151
aVit was ordered by the judge
p152
aVthat the first decision was erased,
p153
aVand that the $2,500 debt was satisfied,
p154
aVand we all signed a written order
p155
aVwhere all the men acknowledged
p156
aVthat what they did was illegal,
p157
aVand if they did it again, that  they would go to prison.
p158
aVMost \u2014
p159
aV(Applause)
p160
aVThanks.
p161
aVAnd most importantly,
p162
aVthe engagement was terminated
p163
aVand Naghma was free.
p164
aVProtecting Naghma and her right to be free
p165
aVprotects us.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow, with my job, there's above-average
p168
aVamount of risks that are involved.
p169
aVI've been temporarily detained.
p170
aVI've been accused of running a brothel,
p171
aVaccused of being a spy.
p172
aVI've had a grenade thrown at my office.
p173
aVIt didn't go off, though.
p174
aVBut I find that with my job,
p175
aVthat the rewards far outweigh the risks,
p176
aVand as many risks as I take,
p177
aVmy clients take far greater risks,
p178
aVbecause they have a lot more to lose
p179
aVif their cases go unheard,
p180
aVor worse, if they're penalized for having me as their lawyer.
p181
aVWith every case that I take,
p182
aVI realize that as much as I'm standing behind my clients,
p183
aVthat they're also standing behind me,
p184
aVand that's what keeps me going.
p185
aa(lp186
VLaw as a point of leverage
p187
aVis crucial in protecting all of us.
p188
aVJournalists are very vital in making sure
p189
aVthat that information is given to the public.
p190
aVToo often, we receive information from journalists
p191
aVbut we forget how that information was given.
p192
aVThis picture is a picture of the
p193
aVBritish press corps in Afghanistan.
p194
aVIt was taken a couple of years ago by my friend David Gill.
p195
aVAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists,
p196
aVsince 2010, there have been  thousands of journalists
p197
aVwho have been threatened, injured,
p198
aVkilled, detained.
p199
aVToo often, when we get this information,
p200
aVwe forget who it affects
p201
aVor how that information is given to us.
p202
aVWhat many journalists do,  both foreign and domestic,
p203
aVis very remarkable, especially in places like Afghanistan,
p204
aVand it's important that we never forget that,
p205
aVbecause what they're protecting
p206
aVis not only our right to receive that information
p207
aVbut also the freedom of the press, which is vital
p208
aVto a democratic society.
p209
aa(lp210
VMatt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan.
p211
aVHe works for The New York Times,
p212
aVand unfortunately, a few months ago
p213
aVhe wrote an article that displeased
p214
aVpeople in the government.
p215
aVAs a result, he was temporarily detained
p216
aVand he was illegally exiled out of the country.
p217
aVI represent Matt,
p218
aVand after dealing with the government,
p219
aVI was able to get legal acknowledgment
p220
aVthat in fact he was illegally exiled,
p221
aVand that freedom of the press does exist in Afghanistan,
p222
aVand there's consequences if that's not followed.
p223
aVAnd I'm happy to say that
p224
aVas of a few days ago,
p225
aVthe Afghan government
p226
aVformally invited him back into the country
p227
aVand they reversed their exile order of him.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VIf you censor one journalist,  then it intimidates others,
p232
aVand soon nations are silenced.
p233
aVIt's important that we protect our journalists
p234
aVand freedom of the press,
p235
aVbecause that makes governments more accountable to us
p236
aVand more transparent.
p237
aVProtecting journalists and our right
p238
aVto receive information protects us.
p239
aa(lp240
VOur world is changing. We live in a different world now,
p241
aVand what were once individual problems
p242
aVare really now global problems for all of us.
p243
aVTwo weeks ago, Afghanistan had its first
p244
aVdemocratic transfer of power
p245
aVand elected president Ashraf Ghani, which is huge,
p246
aVand I'm very optimistic about him,
p247
aVand I'm hopeful that he'll give Afghanistan
p248
aVthe changes that it needs,
p249
aVespecially within the legal sector.
p250
aVWe live in a different world.
p251
aVWe live in a world where my  eight-year-old daughter
p252
aVonly knows a black president.
p253
aVThere's a great possibility that our next president
p254
aVwill be a woman,
p255
aVand as she gets older, she may question,
p256
aVcan a white guy be president?
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aV(Applause)
p259
aa(lp260
VOur world is changing, and  we need to change with it,
p261
aVand what were once individual problems
p262
aVare problems for all of us.
p263
aVAccording to UNICEF,
p264
aVthere are currently over 280 million
p265
aVboys and girls who are married
p266
aVunder the age of 15.
p267
aVTwo hundred and eighty million.
p268
aVChild marriages prolong the vicious cycle
p269
aVof poverty, poor health, lack of education.
p270
aa(lp271
VAt the age of 12, Sahar was married.
p272
aVShe was forced into this marriage
p273
aVand sold by her brother.
p274
aVWhen she went to her in-laws' house,
p275
aVthey forced her into prostitution.
p276
aVBecause she refused, she was tortured.
p277
aVShe was severely beaten with metal rods.
p278
aVThey burned her body.
p279
aVThey tied her up in a basement and starved her.
p280
aVThey used pliers to take out her fingernails.
p281
aVAt one point,
p282
aVshe managed to escape from this torture chamber
p283
aVto a neighbor's house,
p284
aVand when she went there, instead of protecting her,
p285
aVthey dragged her back
p286
aVto her husband's house,
p287
aVand she was tortured even worse.
p288
aa(lp289
VWhen I met first Sahar, thankfully,
p290
aVWomen for Afghan Women
p291
aVgave her a safe haven to go to.
p292
aVAs a lawyer, I try to be very strong
p293
aVfor all my clients,
p294
aVbecause that's very important to me,
p295
aVbut seeing her,
p296
aVhow broken and very weak as she was,
p297
aVwas very difficult.
p298
aVIt took weeks for us to really get to
p299
aVwhat happened to her
p300
aVwhen she was in that house,
p301
aVbut finally she started opening up to me,
p302
aVand when she opened up,
p303
aVwhat I heard was
p304
aVshe didn't know what her rights were,
p305
aVbut she did know she had  a certain level of protection
p306
aVby her government that failed her,
p307
aVand so we were able to talk about
p308
aVwhat her legal options were.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd so we decided to take this case
p311
aVto the Supreme Court.
p312
aVNow, this is extremely significant,
p313
aVbecause this is the first time
p314
aVthat a victim of domestic violence in Afghanistan
p315
aVwas being represented by a lawyer,
p316
aVa law that's been on the  books for years and years,
p317
aVbut until Sahar, had never been used.
p318
aVIn addition to this, we also decided
p319
aVto sue for civil damages,
p320
aVagain using a law that's never been used,
p321
aVbut we used it for her case.
p322
aVSo there we were at the Supreme Court
p323
aVarguing in front of 12 Afghan justices,
p324
aVme as an American female lawyer,
p325
aVand Sahar, a young woman
p326
aVwho when I met her couldn't  speak above a whisper.
p327
aVShe stood up,
p328
aVshe found her voice,
p329
aVand my girl told them that she wanted justice,
p330
aVand she got it.
p331
aVAt the end of it all, the court unanimously agreed
p332
aVthat her in-laws should be arrested for what they did to her,
p333
aVher fucking brother should also be arrested
p334
aVfor selling her \u2014
p335
aV(Applause) \u2014
p336
aVand they agreed that she did have a right
p337
aVto civil compensation.
p338
aVWhat Sahar has shown us is that we can attack
p339
aVexisting bad practices by using the laws
p340
aVin the ways that they're intended to be used,
p341
aVand by protecting Sahar,
p342
aVwe are protecting ourselves.
p343
aa(lp344
VAfter having worked in Afghanistan
p345
aVfor over six years now,
p346
aVa lot of my family and friends think
p347
aVthat what I do looks like this.
p348
aV(Laughter)
p349
aVBut in all actuality, what I do looks like this.
p350
aVNow, we can all do something.
p351
aVI'm not saying we should all buy a plane ticket and go to Afghanistan,
p352
aVbut we can all be contributors
p353
aVto a global human rights economy.
p354
aVWe can create a culture of transparency
p355
aVand accountability to the laws,
p356
aVand make governments more accountable to us,
p357
aVas we are to them.
p358
aa(lp359
VA few months ago, a South African lawyer
p360
aVvisited me in my office
p361
aVand he said, "I wanted to meet you.
p362
aVI wanted to see what a crazy person looked like."
p363
aVThe laws are ours,
p364
aVand no matter what your ethnicity,
p365
aVnationality, gender, race,
p366
aVthey belong to us,
p367
aVand fighting for justice is not an act of insanity.
p368
aVBusinesses also need to get with the program.
p369
aVA corporate investment in human rights
p370
aVis a capital gain on your businesses,
p371
aVand whether you're a business, an NGO,
p372
aVor a private citizen, rule  of law benefits all of us.
p373
aVAnd by working together with a concerted mindset,
p374
aVthrough the people, public and private sector,
p375
aVwe can create a global human rights economy
p376
aVand all become global investors in human rights.
p377
aVAnd by doing this,
p378
aVwe can achieve justness together.
p379
aa(lp380
VThank you.

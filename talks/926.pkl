VFor a moment, what I need to do
p5
aVis project something on the screen of your imagination.
p6
aVWe're in 17th century Japan
p7
aVon the west coast,
p8
aVand a little, wizened monk
p9
aVis hurrying along, near midnight,
p10
aVto the crest of a small hill.
p11
aVHe arrives on the small hill,
p12
aVdripping with water.
p13
aVHe stands there,
p14
aVand he looks across at the island, Sado.
p15
aVAnd he scans across the ocean, and he looks at the sky.
p16
aVThen he says to himself, very quietly,
p17
aV"[Turbulent the sea,]
p18
aV[Stretching across to Sado]
p19
aV[The Milky Way]."
p20
aVBasho was a brilliant man.
p21
aVHe said more with less
p22
aVthan any human
p23
aVthat I have ever read or talked to.
p24
aVBasho, in 17 syllables,
p25
aVjuxtaposed
p26
aVa turbulent ocean
p27
aVdriven by a storm now past,
p28
aVand captured the almost
p29
aVimpossible beauty
p30
aVof our home galaxy
p31
aVwith millions of stars,
p32
aVprobably hundreds and hundreds of \u2014 who knows how many \u2014 planets,
p33
aVmaybe even an ocean
p34
aVthat we will probably call Sylvia in time.
p35
aVAs he was nearing his death,
p36
aVhis disciples and followers
p37
aVkept asking him,
p38
aV"What's the secret?
p39
aVHow can you
p40
aVmake haiku poems so beautiful so easily?"
p41
aVAnd toward the end, he said,
p42
aV"If you would know the pine tree,
p43
aVgo to the pine tree."
p44
aVThat was it.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VSylvia has said we must use
p49
aVevery capacity we have
p50
aVin order to know the oceans.
p51
aVIf we would know the oceans,
p52
aVwe must go to the oceans.
p53
aVAnd what I'd like to talk to you today about, a little bit,
p54
aVis really transforming
p55
aVthe relationship, or the interplay,
p56
aVbetween humans and oceans
p57
aVwith a new capability
p58
aVthat is not at all routine yet.
p59
aVI hope it will be.
p60
aVThere are a few key points.
p61
aVOne of them is the oceans are central
p62
aVto the quality of life on earth.
p63
aVAnother is that there are bold, new ways
p64
aVof studying oceans
p65
aVthat we have not used well yet.
p66
aVAnd the last is that these bold, new ways
p67
aVthat we are exploring
p68
aVas a community
p69
aVwill transform the way we look at our planet, our oceans,
p70
aVand eventually how we manage
p71
aVprobably the entire planet, for what it's worth.
p72
aVSo what scientists do when they begin
p73
aVis to start with the system.
p74
aVThey define what the system is.
p75
aVThe system isn't Chesapeake Bay.
p76
aVIt's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific.
p77
aVIt's the whole planet,
p78
aVthe entire planet, continents and oceans together.
p79
aVThat's the system.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd basically, our challenge
p82
aVis to optimize the benefits
p83
aVand mitigate the risks
p84
aVof living on a planet that's driven by only two processes,
p85
aVtwo sources of energy,
p86
aVone of which is solar,
p87
aVthat drives the winds, the waves,
p88
aVthe clouds, the storms and photosynthesis.
p89
aVThe second one is internal energy.
p90
aVAnd these two war against one another
p91
aValmost continuously.
p92
aVMountain ranges, plate tectonics,
p93
aVmoves the continents around, forms ore deposits.
p94
aVVolcanoes erupt.
p95
aVThat's the planet that we live on.
p96
aVIt's immensely complex.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow I don't expect all of you to see all the details here,
p99
aVbut what I want you to see is
p100
aVthis is about 10 percent
p101
aVof the processes that operate within
p102
aVthe oceans almost continuously,
p103
aVand have for the last 4 billion years.
p104
aVThis is a system that's been around a very long time.
p105
aVAnd these have all co-evolved.
p106
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p107
aVThey interact with one another constantly.
p108
aVAll of them interact with one another.
p109
aVSo the complexity of this system that we're looking at,
p110
aVthe one driven by the sun \u2014
p111
aVupper portion, mostly \u2014
p112
aVand the lower portion is partly driven
p113
aVby the input from heat below
p114
aVand by other processes.
p115
aVThis is very, very important
p116
aVbecause this is the system, this is the crucible,
p117
aVout of which life on the planet came,
p118
aVand it's now time for us to understand it.
p119
aVWe must understand it.
p120
aVThat's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about:
p121
aVunderstand this ocean of ours,
p122
aVthis basic life support system,
p123
aVthe dominant life support system on the planet.
p124
aa(lp125
VLook at this complexity here.
p126
aVThis is only one variable.
p127
aVIf you can see the complexity,
p128
aVyou can see how
p129
aVtiny, little eddies
p130
aVand large eddies and the motion \u2014
p131
aVthis is just sea surface temperature,
p132
aVbut it's immensely complicated.
p133
aVNow a layer in,
p134
aVthe other two or three hundred processes
p135
aVthat are all interacting,
p136
aVpartly as a function of temperature, partly as a function of all the other factors,
p137
aVand you've got a really complicated system.
p138
aVThat's our challenge, is to understand,
p139
aVunderstand this system in new and phenomenal ways.
p140
aVAnd there's an urgency to this.
p141
aVPart of the urgency comes from the fact
p142
aVthat, of order, a billion people on the planet currently
p143
aVare undernourished or starving.
p144
aVAnd part of the issue
p145
aVis for Cody \u2014
p146
aVwho's here,
p147
aV16 years old \u2014
p148
aVand I have permission to relay this number.
p149
aVWhen he, 40 years from now,
p150
aVis the age of Nancy Brown,
p151
aVthere are going to be
p152
aVanother two and a half billion people on the planet.
p153
aVWe can't solve all the problems
p154
aVby looking only at the oceans,
p155
aVbut if we don't understand
p156
aVthe fundamental life support system of this planet
p157
aVmuch more thoroughly than we do now,
p158
aVthen the stresses that we will face,
p159
aVand that Cody will face,
p160
aVand even Nancy, who's going to live till she's 98,
p161
aVwill have really problems coping.
p162
aa(lp163
VAll right, let's talk about another perspective
p164
aVon the importance of the oceans.
p165
aVLook at this diagram, which is showing
p166
aVwarm waters in red,
p167
aVcool waters in blue,
p168
aVand on the continents, what you're seeing in bright green,
p169
aVis the growth of vegetation,
p170
aVand in olive green, the dieback of vegetation.
p171
aVAnd in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away
p172
aVfrom 1982 to 1998
p173
aVand then cycling again.
p174
aVWhat you'll see is that the rhythms
p175
aVof growth, of vegetation \u2014
p176
aVa subset of which is food on the continents \u2014
p177
aVis directly tied to the rhythms
p178
aVof the sea surface temperatures.
p179
aVThe oceans control,
p180
aVor at least significantly influence,
p181
aVcorrelate with,
p182
aVthe growth patterns and the drought patterns
p183
aVand the rain patterns on the continents.
p184
aVSo people in Kansas, in a wheat field in Kansas,
p185
aVneed to understand that the oceans
p186
aVare central to them as well.
p187
aVAnother complexity: this is the age of the oceans.
p188
aVI'm going to layer in on top of this
p189
aVthe tectonic plates.
p190
aVThe age of the ocean, the tectonic plates,
p191
aVgives rise to a totally new phenomenon
p192
aVthat we have heard about
p193
aVin this conference.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd I share with you some very high-definition video
p196
aVthat we collected in real time.
p197
aVSeconds after this video was taken,
p198
aVpeople in Beijing,
p199
aVpeople in Sydney, people in Amsterdam,
p200
aVpeople in Washington D.C. were watching this.
p201
aVNow you've heard of hydrothermal vents,
p202
aVbut the other discovery
p203
aVis that deep below the sea floor,
p204
aVthere is vast reservoir of microbial activity,
p205
aVwhich we have only just discovered
p206
aVand we have almost no way to study.
p207
aVSome people have estimated
p208
aVthat the biomass
p209
aVtied up in these microbes
p210
aVliving in the pours and the cracks
p211
aVof the sea floor and below
p212
aVrival the total amount of living biomass
p213
aVat the surface of the planet.
p214
aVIt's an astonishing insight,
p215
aVand we have only found out about this recently.
p216
aVThis is very, very exciting.
p217
aVIt may be the next rainforest,
p218
aVin terms of pharmaceuticals.
p219
aVWe know little or nothing about it.
p220
aa(lp221
VWell, Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying
p222
aVthat, "The real voyage of discovery
p223
aVconsists not so much in seeking new territory,
p224
aVbut possibly in having new sets of eyes,"
p225
aVnew ways of seeing things,
p226
aVa new mindset.
p227
aVAnd many of you remember
p228
aVthe early stages of oceanography,
p229
aVwhen we had to use what we had at our fingertips.
p230
aVAnd it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days.
p231
aVSome of you remember this, I'm sure.
p232
aVAnd now, we have an entire suite of tools
p233
aVthat are really pretty powerful \u2014
p234
aVships, satellites, moorings.
p235
aVBut they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd the program that I wanted to talk to you about
p238
aVjust a little bit here,
p239
aVwas funded, and it involves autonomous vehicles
p240
aVlike the one running across the base of this image.
p241
aVModeling: on the right hand side,
p242
aVthere's a very complex computational model.
p243
aVOn the left hand side, there's a new type of mooring,
p244
aVwhich I'll show you in just a second.
p245
aVAnd on the basis
p246
aVof several points,
p247
aVthe oceans are complex, and they're central to the life on earth.
p248
aVThey are changing rapidly, but not predictably.
p249
aVAnd the models that we need to predict the future
p250
aVdo not have enough data to refine them.
p251
aVThe computational power
p252
aVis amazing.
p253
aVBut without data, those models
p254
aVwill never ever be predicted.
p255
aVAnd that's what we really need.
p256
aVFor a variety of reasons they're dangerous,
p257
aVbut we feel that OOI,
p258
aVthis Ocean Observatory Initiative,
p259
aVwhich the National Science Foundation
p260
aVhas begun to fund,
p261
aVhas the potential to really transform things.
p262
aVAnd the goal of the program is to
p263
aVlaunch an era of scientific discovery
p264
aVand understanding
p265
aVacross and within the ocean basins,
p266
aVutilizing widely accessible,
p267
aVinteractive telepresence.
p268
aVIt's a new world.
p269
aa(lp270
VWe will be present throughout
p271
aVthe volume of the ocean, at will,
p272
aVcommunicating in real time.
p273
aVAnd this is what the system involves,
p274
aVa number of sites in the southern hemisphere,
p275
aVshown in those circles.
p276
aVAnd in the northern hemisphere there are four sites.
p277
aVI won't talk a lot about most of them right here,
p278
aVbut the one on the west coast, that's in the box,
p279
aVis called the regional scale nodes.
p280
aVIt was once called Neptune.
p281
aVAnd let me show you what's behind it.
p282
aa(lp283
VFiber: next-generation way of communicating.
p284
aVYou can see the copper tips on these things.
p285
aVYou can transmit power,
p286
aVbut the bandwidth is in those tiny, little threads
p287
aVsmaller than the hair on your head in diameter.
p288
aVAnd this particular set here
p289
aVcan transmit something of the order of
p290
aVthree to five terabits per second.
p291
aVThis is phenomenal bandwidth.
p292
aVAnd this is what the planet looks like.
p293
aVWe are already laced up
p294
aVas if we're in a fiber optic corset, if you like.
p295
aVThis is what it looks like.
p296
aVAnd the cables go really continent to continent.
p297
aVIt's a very powerful system,
p298
aVand most of our communications consist of it.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo this is the system that I'm talking about,
p301
aVoff the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate,
p302
aVthe Juan de Fuca tectonic plate.
p303
aVAnd it's going to deliver abundant power
p304
aVand unprecedented bandwidth
p305
aVacross this entire volume \u2014
p306
aVin the overlying ocean,
p307
aVon the sea floor and below the sea floor.
p308
aVBandwidth and power
p309
aVand a wide variety of processes
p310
aVthat will be operating.
p311
aVThis is what one of those primary nodes looks like,
p312
aVand it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth
p313
aVthat can spread out over an area the size of Seattle.
p314
aVAnd the kind of science that can be done
p315
aVwill be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved
p316
aVand can bring the instrumentation to the table.
p317
aVThey will bring it and link it in.
p318
aVIt'll be, in a sense, like having time on a telescope,
p319
aVexcept you'll have your own port.
p320
aVClimate change, ocean acidification,
p321
aVdissolved oxygen,
p322
aVcarbon cycle, coastal upwelling,
p323
aVfishing dynamics \u2014
p324
aVthe full spectrum of
p325
aVearth science and ocean science
p326
aVsimultaneously in the same volume.
p327
aVSo anyone coming along later
p328
aVsimply accesses the database
p329
aVand can draw down the information they need
p330
aVabout anything that has taken place.
p331
aVAnd this is just the first of these.
p332
aVIn conjunction with our Canadian colleagues, we've set this up.
p333
aa(lp334
VNow I want to take you into the caldera.
p335
aVOn the left hand side there
p336
aVis a large volcano called Axial Seamount.
p337
aVAnd we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount
p338
aVusing animation.
p339
aVHere's what this system is going to look like
p340
aVthat we are funded to build at this point.
p341
aVVery powerful.
p342
aVThat's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down,
p343
aVbut it can be controlled by the folks on land
p344
aVwho are responsible for it.
p345
aVOr they can transfer control
p346
aVto someone in India or China
p347
aVwho can take over for a while,
p348
aVbecause it's all going to be directly connected
p349
aVthrough the Internet.
p350
aVThere will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore,
p351
aVall available to anyone who has any interest in using it.
p352
aVThis is going to be much more powerful
p353
aVthan having a single ship
p354
aVin a single location,
p355
aVthen move to a new location.
p356
aa(lp357
VWe're flying across the caldera floor.
p358
aVThere is a number of robotic systems.
p359
aVThere's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will,
p360
aVif those are your experiments.
p361
aVThe kinds of systems that will be down there,
p362
aVthe kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor,
p363
aVconsist of \u2014 if you can read them there \u2014
p364
aVthere's cameras, there's pressure sensors,
p365
aVfluorometers, there's seismometers.
p366
aVIt's a full spectrum of tools.
p367
aVNow, that mound right there
p368
aVactually looks like this.
p369
aVThis is what it actually looks like.
p370
aVAnd this is the kind of activity
p371
aVthat we can see with high-definition video,
p372
aVbecause the bandwidth of these cables
p373
aVis so huge
p374
aVthat we could have five to 10
p375
aVstereo HD systems
p376
aVrunning continuously
p377
aVand, again, directed through robotic techniques from land.
p378
aVVery, very powerful.
p379
aVAnd these are the things that we're funded to do today.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo what can we actually do tomorrow?
p382
aVWe're about to ride the wave
p383
aVof technological opportunity.
p384
aVThere are emerging technologies throughout
p385
aVthe field around oceanography,
p386
aVwhich we will incorporate into oceanography,
p387
aVand through that convergence,
p388
aVwe will transform oceanography into something even more magical.
p389
aVRobotics systems are just incredible these days,
p390
aVabsolutely incredible.
p391
aVAnd we will be bringing robotics of all sorts
p392
aVinto the ocean.
p393
aVNanotechnology: this is a small generator.
p394
aVIt's smaller than a postage stamp,
p395
aVand it can generate power just by being
p396
aVattached to your shirt as you move.
p397
aVJust as you move, it generates power.
p398
aVThere are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean, continuously.
p399
aVImaging: Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I,
p400
aVbut stereo imaging at four times the definition
p401
aVthat we have in HD
p402
aVwill be routine within five years.
p403
aa(lp404
VAnd this is the magic one.
p405
aVAs a result of the human genome process,
p406
aVwe are in a situation where
p407
aVevents that take place in the ocean \u2014
p408
aVlike an erupting volcano, or something of that sort \u2014
p409
aVcan actually be sampled.
p410
aVWe pump the fluid through one of these systems,
p411
aVand we press the button,
p412
aVand it's analyzed for the genomic character.
p413
aVAnd that's transmitted back to land immediately.
p414
aVSo in the volume of the ocean,
p415
aVwe will know, not just the physics and the chemistry,
p416
aVbut the base of the food chain
p417
aVwill be transparent to us
p418
aVwith data on a continuous basis.
p419
aVGrid computing: the power of grid computers
p420
aVis going to be just amazing here.
p421
aVWe will soon be using grid computing
p422
aVto do pretty much everything, like adjust the data
p423
aVand everything
p424
aVthat goes with the data.
p425
aVThe power generation will come from the ocean itself.
p426
aVAnd the next generation fiber
p427
aVwill be simply magic.
p428
aVIt's far beyond what we currently have.
p429
aVSo the presence of the power
p430
aVand the bandwidth in the environment
p431
aVwill allow all of these new technologies
p432
aVto converge in a manner that is just unprecedented.
p433
aa(lp434
VSo within five to seven years,
p435
aVI see us having
p436
aVa capacity to be completely present
p437
aVthroughout the ocean
p438
aVand have all of that connected to the Internet,
p439
aVso we can reach many, many folks.
p440
aVDelivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean
p441
aVwill dramatically accelerate adaptation.
p442
aVHere's an example.
p443
aVWhen earthquakes take place, massive amounts
p444
aVof these new microbes we've never seen before
p445
aVcome out of the sea floor.
p446
aVWe have a way of addressing that,
p447
aVa new way of addressing that.
p448
aVWe've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here
p449
aVthat the top of that volcano is erupting,
p450
aVso we deploy the troops.
p451
aVWhat are the troops? The troops are the autonomous vehicles, of course.
p452
aVAnd they fly into the erupting volcano.
p453
aVThey sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor
p454
aVduring an eruption,
p455
aVwhich have the microbes that have never been
p456
aVto the surface of the planet before.
p457
aVThey eject it to the surface where it floats,
p458
aVand it is picked up
p459
aVby an autonomous airplane,
p460
aVand it's brought back to the laboratory
p461
aVwithin 24 hours of the eruption.
p462
aVThis is doable. All the pieces are there.
p463
aa(lp464
VA laboratory: many of you heard what happened
p465
aVon 9/7.
p466
aVSome doctors in New York City removed
p467
aVthe gallbladder of a woman in France.
p468
aVWe could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning,
p469
aVand it would be on live TV,
p470
aVif we have interesting things to show.
p471
aVSo we can bring an entirely new telepresence
p472
aVto the world, throughout the ocean.
p473
aVThis \u2014 I've shown you sea floor \u2014
p474
aVbut so the goal here is real time interaction
p475
aVwith the oceans from anywhere on earth.
p476
aVIt's going to be amazing.
p477
aa(lp478
VAnd as I go here,
p479

p480
aVand indeed, what we can bring into your pocket.

aVwith a few words
p487
aVfrom another poet, if you'll forgive me.

p490
aVHe won the Nobel Prize for literature
p491
aVin 1948.
p492
aVIn "Little Gidding" he says \u2014
p493
aVspeaking I think for the human race,
p494
aVbut certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia \u2014
p495
aV"We shall not cease from exploration,
p496
aVand the end of all our exploring
p497
aVwill be to arrive where we started
p498
aVand know the place for the first time,
p499
aVarrive through the unknown remembered gate
p500
aVwhere the last of earth left to discover
p501
aVis that which was the beginning.
p502
aVAt the source of the longest river
p503
aVthe voice of a hidden waterfall

VIt was an incredible surprise to me
p5
aVto find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life.
p6
aVBecause, basically,
p7
aVI work as a theoretical physicist.
p8
aVI develop and test models of the Big Bang,
p9
aVusing observational data.
p10
aVAnd I've been moonlighting for the last five years
p11
aVhelping with a project in Africa.
p12
aVAnd, I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge.
p13
aVPeople wonder, you know, "How do you have time to do this?" And so on.
p14
aVAnd so it was simply astonishing to me
p15
aVto find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself
p18
aVand why I lead this schizophrenic life.
p19
aVWell, I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned
p20
aVfor resisting the racist regime.
p21
aVWhen they were released, we left and we went as refugees to Kenya and Tanzania.
p22
aVBoth were very young countries then,
p23
aVand full of hope for the future.
p24
aa(lp25
VWe had an amazing childhood. We didn't have any money,
p26
aVbut we were outdoors most of the time.
p27
aVWe had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world,
p28
aVlike Kilimanjaro, Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge.
p29
aVWell, then we moved to London for high school.
p30
aVAnd after that \u2014 there's nothing much to say about that.
p31
aVIt was rather dull. But I came back to Africa
p32
aVat the age of 17, as a volunteer teacher
p33
aVto Lesotho, which is a tiny country,
p34
aVsurrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa.
p35
aa(lp36
VWell, 80 percent of the men in Lesotho
p37
aVworked in the mines over the border,
p38
aVin brutal conditions.
p39
aVNevertheless, I \u2014 as I'm sure \u2014 as a rather irritating young, white man
p40
aVcoming into their village, I was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth.
p41
aVBut the kids were the best part.
p42
aVThe kids were amazing: extremely eager and often very bright.
p43
aVAnd I'm just going to tell you one story,
p44
aVwhich got through to me.
p45
aa(lp46
VI used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible,
p47
aVto try to connect the academic stuff with the real world.
p48
aVAnd they weren't used to that.
p49
aVBut I took them outside one day and I said,
p50
aV"I want you to estimate the height of the building."
p51
aVAnd I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall,
p52
aVsize it up with a finger, and make an estimate of the height.
p53
aVBut there was one little boy, very small for his age.
p54
aVHe was the son of one of the poorest families in the village.
p55
aVAnd he wasn't doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement.
p56
aVAnd so, I said \u2014 I was annoyed \u2014 I said, "What are you doing?
p57
aVI want you to estimate the height of the building."
p58
aVHe said, "OK. I measured the height of a brick.
p59
aVI counted the number of bricks and now I'm multiplying."
p60
aVWell \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I hadn't thought of that one.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd many experiences like this happened to me.
p63
aVAnother one is that I met a miner. He was home on his three-month leave from the mines.
p64
aVSitting next to him one day, he said, "There's only one thing that I really loved at school.
p65
aVAnd you know what it was? Shakespeare." And he recited some to me.
p66
aVAnd these and many similar experiences convinced me
p67
aVthat there are just tons of bright kids in Africa
p68
aV\u2014 inventive kids, intellectual kids \u2014
p69
aVand starved of opportunity.
p70
aVAnd if Africa is going to get fixed, it's by them, not by us.
p71
aVWell, after \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 that's the truth.
p72
aa(lp73
VWell, after Lesotho, I traveled across Africa
p74
aVbefore returning to England
p75
aV\u2014 so gray and depressing, in comparison.
p76
aVAnd I went to Cambridge. And there, I fell for theoretical physics.
p77
aVWell, I'm not going to explain this equation,
p78
aVbut theoretical physics is really an amazing subject.
p79
aVWe can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line.
p80
aVAnd, admittedly, it's in a very shorthand notation.
p81
aVAnd it contains 18 free parameters,
p82
aVOK, which we have to fit to the data.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo it's not the final story,
p85
aVbut it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know
p86
aVabout nature at the most basic level.
p87
aVAnd apart from a few very important loose ends, which you've heard about here \u2014
p88
aVlike dark energy and dark matter \u2014
p89
aVthis equation describes,
p90
aVseems to describe everything about the universe and what's in it.
p91
aa(lp92
VBut there's one big puzzle remaining,
p93
aVand this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in
p94
aVTanzania, who's a wonderful Scottish lady
p95
aVwho I still stay in touch with.
p96
aVAnd she's now in her 80s.
p97
aVAnd when I try to explain my work to her, she waved away all the details, and she said,
p98
aV"Neil, there's only one question that really matters.
p99
aVWhat banged?" (Laughter)
p100
aV"Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged?"
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding.
p103
aVThe standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence,
p104
aVfull of a strange kind of energy
p105
aV\u2014 inflationary energy \u2014 which blew it up.
p106
aVBut the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state
p107
aVis completely unsolved.
p108
aVNow, I worked on that theory for a while, with Stephen Hawking and others.
p109
aVBut then I began to explore another alternative.
p110
aVThe alternative is that the Big Bang wasn't the beginning.
p111
aVPerhaps the universe existed before the bang,
p112
aVand the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe.
p113
aa(lp114
VWell, this possibility is actually suggested
p115
aVby the latest theories, the unified theories,
p116
aVwhich try to explain all those 18 free parameters
p117
aVin a single framework, which will hopefully predict all of them.
p118
aVAnd I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here.
p119
aVIt's all I can convey. According to these theories,
p120
aVthere are extra dimensions of space, not just the three we're familiar with,
p121
aVbut at every point in the room there are more dimensions.
p122
aVAnd in particular, there's one rather strange one,
p123
aVin the most elegant unified theories we have.
p124
aVThe strange one looks likes this:
p125
aVthat we live in a three-dimensional world.
p126
aVWe live in one of these worlds, and I can only show it as a sheet,
p127
aVbut it's really three-dimensional.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd a tiny distance away, there's another sheet,
p130
aValso three-dimensional, and they're separated by a gap.
p131
aVThe gap is very tiny, and I've blown it up so you can see it.
p132
aVBut it's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus.
p133
aVI won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this,
p134
aVbut it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know.
p135
aVWell, I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question.
p136
aVWhich is, what happens if these two, three-dimensional worlds
p137
aVshould actually collide?
p138
aVAnd if they collide, it would look a lot like the Big Bang.
p139
aVBut it's slightly different than in the conventional picture.
p140
aVThe conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point.
p141
aVEverything comes out of a point;
p142
aVyou have infinite density. And all the equations break down.
p143
aVNo hope of describing that.
p144
aa(lp145
VIn this picture, you'll notice,
p146
aVthe bang is extended. It's not a point.
p147
aVThe density of matter is finite, and we have a chance
p148
aVof a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process.
p149
aVSo, to cut a long story short, we've explored this alternative.
p150
aVWe've shown that it can fit
p151
aVall of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies,
p152
aVthe fluctuations in the microwave background.
p153
aVFurthermore, there's an experimental way
p154
aVto tell this theory, apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before.
p155
aVIt involves gravitational waves.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd in this scenario, not only was the Big Bang not the beginning,
p158
aVas you can see from the picture,
p159
aVit can happen over and over again.
p160
aVIt may be that we live in an endless universe,
p161
aVboth in space and in time.
p162
aVAnd there've been bangs in the past, and there will be bangs in the future.
p163
aVAnd maybe we live in an endless universe.
p164
aVWell, making and testing models of the universe
p165
aVis, for me, the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe.
p166
aVWe need to make the best mathematical models we can,
p167
aVthe most consistent ones.
p168
aVAnd then we scrutinize them, logically and with data.
p169
aVAnd we try to convince ourselves \u2014
p170
aVwe really try to convince ourselves they're wrong.
p171
aVThat's progress: when we prove things wrong.
p172
aVAnd gradually, we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world.
p173
aa(lp174
VAs I pursued my career, something was always gnawing away inside me.
p175
aVWhat about Africa?
p176
aVWhat about those kids I'd left behind?
p177
aVInstead of developing, as we'd all hoped in the '60s,
p178
aVthings had gotten worse.
p179
aVAfrica was gripped by poverty, disease and war.
p180
aVThis is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project.
p181
aVAnd so the idea is to represent each country
p182
aVon a map, but scale the area according to some quantity.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo here's just the standard area map of the world.
p185
aVBy the way, Africa is very large.
p186
aVAnd the next map now shows Africa's GDP in 1960,
p187
aVaround the time of independence for many African states.
p188
aVNow, this is 1990, and then 2002. And here's a projection for 2015.
p189
aVBig changes are happening in the world,
p190
aVbut they're not helping Africa.
p191
aa(lp192
VWhat about Africa's population? The population isn't out of proportion to its area,
p193
aVbut Africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes:
p194
aVmalnutrition, simple infections and birth complications.
p195
aVThen there's HIV/AIDS. And then there are deaths from war.
p196
aVOK, currently there are 45,000 people a month dying in the Congo,
p197
aVas a consequence of the war
p198
aVthere over coltan and diamonds and other things.
p199
aVIt's still going on.
p200
aa(lp201
VWhat about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems?
p202
aVWell, here's the number of physicians in Africa.
p203
aVHere's the number of people in higher education.
p204
aVAnd here \u2014 most shocking to me \u2014
p205
aVthe number of scientific research papers coming out of Africa.
p206
aVIt just doesn't exist scientifically.
p207
aVAnd this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa:
p208
aVthat all of the aid that's been given
p209
aVhas completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet.
p210
aa(lp211
VWell, the transition to democracy in South Africa in 1994
p212
aVwas literally a dream come true for many of us.
p213
aVMy parents were both elected to the first parliament,
p214
aValongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela. They were the only other couple.
p215
aVAnd in 2001, I took a research leave to visit them.
p216
aVAnd while I was busy working \u2014 I was working on these colliding worlds, in the day.
p217
aVBut I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills,
p218
aVespecially mathematical skills, in industry, in government, in education.
p219
aa(lp220
VThe ability to make and test models has become essential,
p221
aVnot only to every single area of science today,
p222
aVbut also to modern society itself.
p223
aVAnd if you don't have math, you're not going to enter the modern age.
p224
aVSo I had an idea. And the idea was very simple.
p225
aVThe idea was to set up an African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, or AIMS.
p226
aVAnd let's recruit students from the whole of Africa,
p227
aVbring them together with lecturers from all over the world,
p228
aVand we'll try to give them a fantastic education.
p229
aa(lp230
VWell, as a Cambridge professor, I had many contacts.
p231
aVAnd to my astonishment, they backed me 100 percent.
p232
aVThey said, "Go and do it,
p233
aVand we'll come and lecture."
p234
aVAnd I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students
p235
aVfrom these countries \u2014 where they don't have any opportunities \u2014 together
p236
aVwith the best lecturers in the world \u2014
p237
aVwho I knew would come, because of the interest in Africa \u2014
p238
aVand put them together and just let the sparks fly.
p239
aVSo we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town.
p240
aVIt's an 80-room Art Deco hotel from the 1920s.
p241
aVThe area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars.
p242
aVIt's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it
p243
aVand then put out the word:
p244
aVwe're going to start the best math institute in Africa
p245
aVin this hotel.
p246
aa(lp247
VWell, the new South Africa is a very exciting country.
p248
aVAnd those of you who haven't been there, you should go.
p249
aVIt's very, very interesting what's happening.
p250
aVAnd we recruited wonderful staff,
p251
aVhighly motivated staff.
p252
aVThe other thing that's happened, which was good for us, is the Internet.
p253
aVEven though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa,
p254
aVthere are Internet cafes everywhere.
p255
aVAnd bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community,
p256
aVto be successful \u2014 and they're very ambitious.
p257
aVThey want to be the next Einstein.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd so when word came out that AIMS was opening,
p260
aVit spread very quickly via e-mail and our website.
p261
aVAnd we got lots of applicants.
p262
aVWell, we designed AIMS as a 24-hour learning environment,
p263
aVand it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning.
p264
aVYou have to rethink, what is the university for?
p265
aVAnd that's really exciting.
p266
aVSo we designed it to have interactive teaching.
p267
aVNo droning on at the chalkboard.
p268
aVWe emphasize problem-solving, working in groups,
p269
aVevery student discovering and maximizing their own potential
p270
aVand not chasing grades.
p271
aa(lp272
VEveryone lives together in this hotel \u2014 lecturers and students \u2014
p273
aVand it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 a.m.
p274
aVThe students don't usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m.
p275
aVAnd then they're up again at eight in the morning.
p276
aVLectures, problem-solving and so on. It's an extraordinary place.
p277
aVWe especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa's development,
p278
aVbecause, in those areas, scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage.
p279
aVThey'll publish, be invited to conferences.
p280
aVThey'll do well. They'll have successful careers.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd AIMS has done extremely well.
p283
aVHere is a list of last year's graduates, graduated in June,
p284
aVand what they're currently doing \u2014 48 of them.
p285
aVAnd where they are is indicated over here.
p286
aVAnd where they've gone. So these are all postgraduate students.
p287
aVAnd they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places.
p288
aVFive students can be educated at AIMS
p289
aVfor the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe.
p290
aVBut more important, the pan-African student body
p291
aVis a continual source of strength, pride and commitment to Africa.
p292
aVWe illustrate AIMS' progress by coloring in the countries of Africa.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo here you can see behind this list.
p295
aVWhen a county is colored yellow, we've received an application;
p296
aVorange, we've accepted an application; and green,
p297
aVa student has graduated.
p298
aVSo here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004.
p299
aVAnd we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green.
p300
aVSo there's 2005, -6, -7, -8.
p301
aV(Applause)
p302
aVWe're well on the way to achieving our initial goal.
p303
aa(lp304
VWe had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS.
p305
aVAnd I'll just show you one.
p306
aVTendai Mugwagwa: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa.
p307
aVI have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree.
p308
aVI will be attending AIMS.
p309
aVMy understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot.
p310
aVYou know, from physics to medicine,
p311
aVin particular, epidemiology and also mathematical modeling.
p312
aVNeil Turok: So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well.
p313
aVAnd I'll let her take it from there.
p314
aa(lp315
VTM: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa
p316
aVand I was a student at AIMS in 2003 and 2004.
p317
aVAfter leaving AIMS, I went on to do a master's in applied mathematics
p318
aVat the University of Cape Town in South Africa.
p319
aVAfter that, I came to the Netherlands
p320
aVwhere I'm now doing a Ph.D. in theoretical immunology.
p321
aa(lp322
VProfessor: Tendai is working very independently.
p323
aVShe communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital.
p324
aVSo all in all I have a very good Ph.D. student from South Africa.
p325
aVSo I'm happy she's here.
p326
aa(lp327
VNT: Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu.
p328
aVAnd he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher.
p329
aVAnd then entering university in northern Nigeria.
p330
aVAnd after AIMS, Shehu wanted to do high-energy physics,
p331
aVand he came to Cambridge.
p332
aVHe's about to finish his Ph.D.,
p333
aVand he was filmed recently with someone you all know.
p334
aa(lp335
VShehu: And from there we will be able to,
p336
aVhopefully, make better predictions and then we compare it
p337
aVto the graph and also make some predictions.
p338
aa(lp339
VStephen Hawking: That is nice.
p340
aa(lp341
VNT: Here are the current students at AIMS. There are 53 of them
p342
aVfrom 20 different countries, including 20 women.
p343
aVSo now I'm going to get to my TED business.
p344
aVWell, we had a party. This is Africa \u2014
p345
aVwe have good parties in Africa. And last month, they threw a surprise party for me.
p346
aVHere's somebody you've seen already.
p347
aV(Applause)
p348
aVI want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture.
p349
aVSo, we were having a party,
p350
aVas you can see they're completely eclipsing me at this point.
p351
aVThis is Ezra. She's from Darfur.
p352
aVShe's a physicist, and somehow stays smiling,
p353
aVin spite of everything going on back home.
p354
aVBut she wants to continue in physics, and she's doing extremely well.
p355
aVThis is Lydia. Lydia is the first ever woman
p356
aVto graduate in mathematics in the Central African Republic.
p357
aVAnd she's now at AIMS. (Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
VSo now let me get to our TED wish.
p360
aVWell, it's not my TED wish; it's our wish, as you've already gathered.
p361
aVAnd our wish has two parts:
p362
aVone is a dream and the other's a plan. OK.
p363
aVOur TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African. (Applause)
p364
aVIn striving for the heights of creative genius,
p365
aVwe want to give thousands of people the motivation,
p366
aVthe encouragement and the courage
p367
aVto obtain the high-level skills they need to help Africa.
p368
aVAmong them will be not only brilliant scientists \u2014
p369
aVI'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS \u2014
p370
aVthey'll also be the African Gates, Brins and Pages of the future.
p371
aa(lp372
VWell, I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple.
p373
aVAIMS is now a proven model.
p374
aVAnd what we need to do is to replicate it.
p375
aVWe want to roll out 15 AIMS centers in the next five years, all over Africa.
p376
aVEach will have a pan-African student body,
p377
aVbut specialize in a different area of science.
p378
aVWe want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers,
p379
aVas it does at AIMS.
p380
aVAnd we want to add elements to the curriculum.
p381
aVWe want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills.
p382
aa(lp383
VThe expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan-African institution,
p384
aVand its graduates will form a powerful network,
p385
aVworking together for peace and progress across the continent.
p386
aVOver the last year,
p387
aVwe've been visiting sites in Africa,
p388
aVlooking at potential sites for new AIMS centers.
p389
aVAnd here are the ones we've selected.
p390
aVAnd each of these centers has a strong local team,
p391
aVeach is in a beautiful place, an interesting place,
p392
aVwhich international lecturers will be happy to visit.
p393
aVAnd our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this.
p394
aVEveryone wants an AIMS center in their country.
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd last November,
p397
aVthe conference of all the African ministers of science and technology,
p398
aVheld in Mombasa, called for a comprehensive plan to roll out AIMS.
p399
aVSo we have political support right across the continent.
p400
aVIt won't be easy.
p401
aVAt every site there will be huge challenges.
p402
aVLocal scientists must play leading roles
p403
aVand governments must be persuaded to buy in.
p404
aVConditions are very difficult,
p405
aVbut we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made AIMS work.
p406
aa(lp407
VAnd we summarize them this way:
p408
aVthe institutes have got to be relevant, innovative,
p409
aVcost-effective and high quality. Why?
p410
aVBecause we want Africa to be rich.
p411
aVEasy to remember the basic rules we need.
p412
aVSo, just in ending, let me say the only people who can fix Africa
p413
aVare talented young Africans.
p414
aVBy unlocking and nurturing their creative potential,
p415
aVwe can create a step change in Africa's future.
p416
aVOver time, they will contribute to African development
p417
aVand to science in ways we can only imagine.
p418
aVThank you.

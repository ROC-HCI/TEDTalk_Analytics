VHetain Patel: (In Chinese)
p5
aa(lp6
VYuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain. I'm an artist.
p7
aVAnd this is Yuyu,
p8
aVwho is a dancer I have been working with.
p9
aVI have asked her to translate for me.
p10
aa(lp11
VHP: (In Chinese)
p12
aa(lp13
VYR: If I may, I would like to tell you
p14
aVa little bit about myself
p15
aVand my artwork.
p16
aa(lp17
VHP: (In Chinese)
p18
aa(lp19
VYR: I was born and raised near Manchester,
p20
aVin England,
p21
aVbut I'm not going to say it in English to you,
p22
aVbecause I'm trying to avoid any assumptions
p23
aVthat might be made from my northern accent.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VHP: (In Chinese)
p28
aa(lp29
VYR: The only problem with masking it
p30
aVwith Chinese Mandarin
p31
aVis I can only speak this paragraph,
p32
aVwhich I have learned by heart
p33
aVwhen I was visiting in China. (Laughter)
p34
aVSo all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones
p35
aVand hope you won't notice.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VHP: (In Chinese)
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VYR: Needless to say, I would like to apologize
p44
aVto any Mandarin speakers in the audience.
p45
aa(lp46
VAs a child, I would hate being made
p47
aVto wear the Indian kurta pajama,
p48
aVbecause I didn't think it was very cool.
p49
aVIt felt a bit girly to me, like a dress,
p50
aVand it had this baggy trouser part
p51
aVyou had to tie really tight
p52
aVto avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.
p53
aVMy dad never wore it,
p54
aVso I didn't see why I had to.
p55
aVAlso, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable,
p56
aVthat people assume I represent something
p57
aVgenuinely Indian when I wear it,
p58
aVbecause that's not how I feel.
p59
aa(lp60
VHP: (In Chinese)
p61
aa(lp62
VYR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable
p63
aVwearing it is by pretending
p64
aVthey are the robes of a kung fu warrior
p65
aVlike Li Mu Bai from that film,
p66
aV"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."
p67
aa(lp68
V(Music)
p69
aa(lp70
VOkay.
p71
aVSo my artwork is about identity and language,
p72
aVchallenging common assumptions
p73
aVbased on how we look like or where we come from,
p74
aVgender, race, class.
p75
aVWhat makes us who we are anyway?
p76
aa(lp77
VHP: (In Chinese)
p78
aa(lp79
VYR: I used to read Spider-Man comics,
p80
aVwatch kung fu movies,
p81
aVtake philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee.
p82
aVHe would say things like \u2014
p83
aa(lp84
VHP: Empty your mind.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVBe formless, shapeless, like water.
p87
aVNow you put water into a cup.
p88
aVIt becomes the cup.
p89
aVYou put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
p90
aVPut it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
p91
aVNow, water can flow
p92
aVor it can crash.
p93
aVBe water, my friend. (Applause)
p94
aa(lp95
VYR: This year, I am 32 years old,
p96
aVthe same age Bruce Lee was when he died.
p97
aVI have been wondering recently,
p98
aVif he were alive today,
p99
aVwhat advice he would give me
p100
aVabout making this TED Talk.
p101
aa(lp102
VHP: Don't imitate my voice.
p103
aVIt offends me.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VYR: Good advice,
p108
aVbut I still think that we learn who we are
p109
aVby copying others.
p110
aVWho here hasn't imitated their childhood hero
p111
aVin the playground, or mum or father?
p112
aVI have.
p113
aa(lp114
VHP: A few years ago, in order to make this video
p115
aVfor my artwork, I shaved off all my hair
p116
aVso that I could grow it back as my father had it
p117
aVwhen he first emigrated from India
p118
aVto the U.K. in the 1960s.
p119
aVHe had a side parting and a neat mustache.
p120
aa(lp121
VAt first, it was going very well.
p122
aVI even started to get discounts in Indian shops.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VBut then very quickly,
p127
aVI started to underestimate
p128
aVmy mustache growing ability,
p129
aVand it got way too big.
p130
aVIt didn't look Indian anymore.
p131
aVInstead, people from across the road,
p132
aVthey would shout things like \u2014
p133
aa(lp134
VHP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! Ándale! Ándale!
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VHP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this.
p139
aVMy dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore.
p140
aVHe talks like this now.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo it's not just my father that I've imitated.
p143
aVA few years ago I went to China for a few months,
p144
aVand I couldn't speak Chinese,
p145
aVand this frustrated me,
p146
aVso I wrote about this and had it translated
p147
aVinto Chinese, and then I learned this by heart,
p148
aVlike music, I guess.
p149
aa(lp150
VYR: This phrase is now etched into my mind
p151
aVclearer than the pin number to my bank card,
p152
aVso I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently.
p153
aVWhen I had learned this phrase,
p154
aVI had an artist over there hear me out
p155
aVto see how accurate it sounded.
p156
aa(lp157
VI spoke the phrase, and then he laughed
p158
aVand told me, "Oh yeah, that's great,
p159
aVonly it kind of sounds like a woman."
p160
aa(lp161
VI said, "What?"
p162
aa(lp163
VHe said, "Yeah, you learned from a woman?"
p164
aa(lp165
VI said, "Yes. So?"
p166
aa(lp167
VHe then explained the tonal differences
p168
aVbetween male and female voices
p169
aVare very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well,
p170
aVbut in a woman's voice.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VHP: Okay. So this imitation business
p177
aVdoes come with risk.
p178
aVIt doesn't always go as you plan it,
p179
aVeven with a talented translator.
p180
aVBut I am going to stick with it,
p181
aVbecause contrary to what we might usually assume,
p182
aVimitating somebody can reveal something unique.
p183
aVSo every time I fail
p184
aVto become more like my father,
p185
aVI become more like myself.
p186
aVEvery time I fail to become Bruce Lee,
p187
aVI become more authentically me.
p188
aa(lp189
VThis is my art.
p190
aVI strive for authenticity,
p191
aVeven if it comes in a shape
p192
aVthat we might not usually expect.
p193
aVIt's only recently that I've started to understand
p194
aVthat I didn't learn to sit like this
p195
aVthrough being Indian.
p196
aVI learned this from Spider-Man.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VThank you.

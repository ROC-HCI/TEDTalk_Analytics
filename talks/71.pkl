VI'm often asked,
p5
aV"What surprised you about the book?"
p6
aVAnd I say, "That I got to write it."
p7
aVI would have never imagined that.
p8
aVNot in my wildest dreams did I think \u2014
p9
aVI don't even consider myself to be an author.
p10
aVAnd I'm often asked,
p11
aV"Why do you think so many people have read this?
p12
aVThis thing's selling still about a million copies a month."
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd I think it's because spiritual emptiness
p15
aVis a universal disease.
p16
aVI think inside at some point, we put our heads down on the pillow and we go,
p17
aV"There's got to be more to life than this."
p18
aVGet up in the morning, go to work, come home and watch TV,
p19
aVgo to bed, get up in the morning, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed,
p20
aVgo to parties on weekends.
p21
aVA lot of people say, "I'm living." No, you're not living \u2014 that's just existing.
p22
aVJust existing.
p23
aVI really think that there's this inner desire.
p24
aVI do believe what Chris said; I believe that you're not an accident.
p25
aVYour parents may not have planned you, but I believe God did.
p26
aVI think there are accidental parents; there's no doubt about that.
p27
aVI don't think there are accidental kids.
p28
aVAnd I think you matter.
p29
aa(lp30
VI think you matter to God; I think you matter to history;
p31
aVI think you matter to this universe.
p32
aVAnd I think that the difference
p33
aVbetween what I call the survival level of living, the success level of living,
p34
aVand the significance level of living is:
p35
aVDo you figure out, "What on Earth am I here for?"
p36
aVI meet a lot of people who are very smart,
p37
aVand say, "But why can't I figure out my problems?"
p38
aVAnd I meet a lot of people who are very successful,
p39
aVwho say, "Why don't I feel more fulfilled?
p40
aVWhy do I feel like a fake?
p41
aVWhy do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am?"
p42
aVI think that comes down to this issue of meaning, of significance, of purpose.
p43
aVI think it comes down to this issue of:
p44
aV"Why am I here? What am I here for? Where am I going?"
p45
aVThese are not religious issues.
p46
aVThey're human issues.
p47
aa(lp48
VI wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does,
p49
aVbecause it makes my life work a whole lot easier.
p50
aVAs a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.
p51
aVAnd I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life.
p52
aVReligion doesn't have a monopoly on that,
p53
aVbut there are plenty of religious kooks.
p54
aVThere are secular kooks; there are smart kooks, dumb kooks.
p55
aVThere are people \u2014 a lady came up to me the other day,
p56
aVand she had a white piece of paper \u2014 Michael, you'll like this one \u2014
p57
aVand she said, "What do you see in it?"
p58
aVAnd I looked at it and I said, "Oh, I don't see anything."
p59
aVAnd she goes, "Well, I see Jesus," and started crying and left.
p60
aVI'm going, "OK," you know? "Fine."
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VGood for you.
p65
aa(lp66
VWhen the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years,
p67
aVI kind of had my little crisis.
p68
aVAnd that was: What is the purpose of this?
p69
aVBecause it brought in enormous amounts of money.
p70
aVWhen you write the best-selling book in the world,
p71
aVit's tons and tons of money.
p72
aVAnd it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted.
p73
aVWhen I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old.
p74
aVI started it with one other family in 1980.
p75
aVAnd I decided that I was never going to go on TV,
p76
aVbecause I didn't want to be a celebrity.
p77
aVI didn't want to be a, quote, "evangelist, televangelist" \u2014
p78
aVthat's not my thing.
p79
aVAnd all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention.
p80
aVI don't think \u2014
p81
aVnow, this is a worldview,
p82
aVand I will tell you, everybody's got a worldview.
p83
aa(lp84
VEverybody's betting their life on something.
p85
aVYou're betting your life on something,
p86
aVyou just better know why you're betting what you're betting on.
p87
aVSo, everybody's betting their life on something.
p88
aVAnd when I, you know, made a bet,
p89
aVI happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was.
p90
aVAnd I believe in a pluralistic society,
p91
aVeverybody's betting on something.
p92
aVAnd when I started the church,
p93
aVyou know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now.
p94
aVAnd then when I wrote this book,
p95
aVand all of a sudden, it just took off,
p96
aVand I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this?
p97
aVBecause as I started to say,
p98
aVI don't think you're given money or fame
p99
aVfor your own ego, ever.
p100
aVI just don't believe that.
p101
aVAnd when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is,
p102
aV"It's not about you,"
p103
aVthen, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history,
p104
aVyou've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me.
p105
aVThat's kind of a no-brainer.
p106
aVSo, what is it for?
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd I began to think about what I call the "stewardship of affluence"
p109
aVand the "stewardship of influence."
p110
aVSo I believe, essentially, leadership is stewardship.
p111
aVThat if you are a leader in any area \u2014
p112
aVin business, in politics, in sports, in art,
p113
aVin academics, in any area \u2014
p114
aVyou don't own it.
p115
aVYou are a steward of it.
p116
aVFor instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment.
p117
aVThis is not my planet.
p118
aVIt wasn't mine before I was born, it's not going to be mine after I die,
p119
aVI'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.
p120
aa(lp121
VI was debating the other day on a talk show,
p122
aVand the guy was challenging me and he'd go,
p123
aV"What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment?"
p124
aVAnd I asked this guy, I said, "Well, do you believe
p125
aVthat human beings are responsible
p126
aVto make the world a little bit better place for the next generation?
p127
aVDo you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?"
p128
aVAnd he said, "No."
p129
aVI said, "Oh, you don't?"
p130
aVI said, "Let me make this clear again:
p131
aVDo you believe that as human beings \u2014 I'm not talking about religion \u2014
p132
aVdo you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility
p133
aVto take care of this planet,
p134
aVand make it just a little bit better for the next generation?"
p135
aVAnd he said, "No. Not any more than any other species."
p136
aVWhen he said the word "species," he was revealing his worldview.
p137
aVAnd he was saying,
p138
aV"I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is."
p139
aVWell now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks,
p140
aVbut you're not a duck.
p141
aVYou're not a duck.
p142
aVAnd you are responsible \u2014 that's my worldview.
p143
aVAnd so, you need to understand what your worldview is.
p144
aa(lp145
VThe problem is most people never really think it through.
p146
aVThey never really ...
p147
aVcodify it or qualify it or quantify it,
p148
aVand say, "This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe."
p149
aVI don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist.
p150
aVBut you may, you may.
p151
aVYour worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life,
p152
aVbecause it determines your decisions;
p153
aVit determines your relationships;
p154
aVit determines your level of confidence.
p155
aVIt determines, really, everything in your life.
p156
aVWhat we believe, obviously \u2014
p157
aVand you know this \u2014 determines our behavior,
p158
aVand our behavior determines what we become in life.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo all of this money started pouring in,
p161
aVand all of this fame started pouring in.
p162
aVAnd I'm going, what do I do with this?
p163
aVMy wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money.
p164
aVWe said, "First, we're not going to use it on ourselves."
p165
aVI didn't go out and buy a bigger house.
p166
aVI don't own a guesthouse.
p167
aVI still drive the same four year-old Ford that I've driven.
p168
aVWe just said, we're not going to use it on us.
p169
aVThe second thing was,
p170
aVI stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor.
p171
aVThird thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me
p172
aVover the last 25 years, and I gave it back.
p173
aVAnd I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking
p174
aVthat I do what I do for money \u2014 I don't.
p175
aVIn fact, personally, I've never met
p176
aVa priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money.
p177
aVI know that's the stereotype; I've never met one of them.
p178
aVBelieve me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money.
p179
aa(lp180
VPastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call, they're like doctors.
p181
aVI left late today \u2014 I'd hoped to be here yesterday \u2014
p182
aVbecause my father-in-law is in his last, probably, 48 hours
p183
aVbefore he dies of cancer.
p184
aVAnd I'm watching a guy who's lived his life \u2014
p185
aVhe's now in his mid-80s \u2014 and he's dying with peace.
p186
aVYou know, the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times.
p187
aVThe test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral.
p188
aVAnd having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals,
p189
aVit makes a difference.
p190
aVIt makes a difference what you believe.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo, we gave it all back,
p193
aVand then we set up three foundations,
p194
aVworking on some of the major problems of the world:
p195
aVilliteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases \u2014 particularly HIV/AIDS \u2014
p196
aVand set up these three foundations, and put the money into that.
p197
aVThe last thing we did is we became what I call "reverse tithers."
p198
aVAnd that is, when my wife and I got married 30 years ago,
p199
aVwe started tithing.
p200
aVNow, that's a principle in the Bible
p201
aVthat says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity,
p202
aVgive it away to help other people.
p203
aVSo, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe one percent.
p204
aVSo, our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent,
p205
aVsecond year we went to 12 percent,
p206
aVand the third year we went to 13 percent,
p207
aVand on and on and on.
p208
aVWhy did I do that?
p209
aVBecause every time I give,
p210
aVit breaks the grip of materialism in my life.
p211
aa(lp212
VMaterialism is all about getting \u2014 get, get, get, get all you can,
p213
aVcan all you get, sit on the can and spoil the rest.
p214
aVIt's all about more, having more.
p215
aVAnd we think that the good life is actually looking good \u2014
p216
aVthat's most important of all \u2014
p217
aVlooking good, feeling good and having the goods.
p218
aVBut that's not the good life.
p219
aVI meet people all the time who have those, and they're not necessarily happy.
p220
aVIf money actually made you happy,
p221
aVthen the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest.
p222
aVAnd that I know, personally, I know, is not true.
p223
aVIt's just not true.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo, the good life is not about looking good, feeling good or having the goods,
p226
aVit's about being good and doing good.
p227
aVGiving your life away.
p228
aVSignificance in life doesn't come from status,
p229
aVbecause you can always find somebody who's got more than you.
p230
aVIt doesn't come from sex.
p231
aVIt doesn't come from salary.
p232
aVIt comes from serving.
p233
aVIt is in giving our lives away that we find meaning,
p234
aVwe find significance.
p235
aVThat's the way we were wired, I believe, by God.
p236
aVAnd so we began to give away,
p237
aVand now after 30 years,
p238
aVmy wife and I are reverse tithers \u2014 we give away 90 percent and live on 10.
p239
aVThat, actually, was the easy part.
p240
aVThe hard part is, what do I do with all this attention?
p241
aVBecause I started getting all kinds of invitations.
p242
aVI just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour
p243
aVon three different continents,
p244
aVand I won't go into that,
p245
aVbut it was an amazing thing.
p246
aVAnd I'm going, what do I do with this notoriety
p247
aVthat the book has brought?
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd, being a pastor, I started reading the Bible.
p250
aVThere's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72,
p251
aVand it's Solomon's prayer for more influence.
p252
aVWhen you read this prayer,
p253
aVit sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered.
p254
aVHe says, "God, I want you to make me famous."
p255
aVThat's what he prays.
p256
aVHe said, "I want you to make me famous.
p257
aVI want you to spread the fame of my name through every land,
p258
aVI want you to give me power.
p259
aVI want you to make me famous, I want you to give me influence."
p260
aVAnd it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make,
p261
aVif you were going to pray.
p262
aVUntil you read the whole psalm, the whole chapter.
p263
aVAnd then he says, "So that the king ..." \u2014
p264
aVhe was the king of Israel at that time, at its apex in power \u2014
p265
aV"... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan,
p266
aVsupport the oppressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick,
p267
aVassist the poor, speak up for the foreigner,
p268
aVthose in prison."
p269
aVBasically, he's talking about all the marginalized in society.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd as I read that,
p272
aVI looked at it, and I thought, you know,
p273
aVwhat this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up
p274
aVfor those who have no influence.
p275
aVThe purpose of influence is not to build your ego.
p276
aVOr your net worth.
p277
aVAnd, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth.
p278
aVYour value is not based on your valuables.
p279
aVIt's based on a whole different set of things.
p280
aVAnd so the purpose of influence is to speak up
p281
aVfor those who have no influence.
p282
aVAnd I had to admit:
p283
aVI can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans.
p284
aVThey're not on my radar.
p285
aVI pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America \u2014
p286
aVa bunch of gated communities.
p287
aVI have a church full of CEOs and scientists.
p288
aVAnd I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person.
p289
aVThey're just not in my pathway.
p290
aVNow, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana.
p291
aVSo I had to say, ok,
p292
aVI would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got
p293
aVto help those who don't have either of those.
p294
aa(lp295
VYou know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses,
p296
aVwhether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me.
p297
aVBut Moses, if you saw the movie, "The Ten Commandments,"
p298
aVMoses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and God talks to him,
p299
aVand God says, "Moses, what's in your hand?"
p300
aVI think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked:
p301
aVWhat's in your hand?
p302
aVMoses says, "It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff."
p303
aVAnd God says, "Throw it down."
p304
aVAnd if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake.
p305
aVAnd then God says, "Pick it up."
p306
aVAnd he picks it back up again,
p307
aVand it becomes a staff again.
p308
aVNow, I'm reading this thing, and I'm going, what is that all about?
p309
aVOK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things.
p310
aVNumber one, God never does a miracle to show off.
p311
aVIt's not just, "Wow, isn't that cool?"
p312
aVAnd, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread.
p313
aVYou know, if God's going to show up, he's not going to show up on cheese bread.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
VOk? I just, this is why I love what Michael does,
p318
aVbecause it's like, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to.
p319
aVBut God \u2014 my God \u2014 doesn't show up on sprinkler images.
p320
aVHe's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do.
p321
aVBut he doesn't do miracles just to show off.
p322
aa(lp323
VSecond thing is, if God ever asks you a question,
p324
aVhe already knows the answer.
p325
aVObviously, if he's God, then that would mean
p326
aVthat when he asks the question, it's for your benefit, not his.
p327
aVSo he's going, "What's in your hand?"
p328
aVNow, what was in Moses' hand?
p329
aVWell, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this.
p330
aa(lp331
VThis staff represented three things about Moses' life.
p332
aVFirst, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd.
p333
aVIt's the symbol of his own occupation:
p334
aVI am a shepherd.
p335
aVIt's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job.
p336
aVSecond, it's a symbol of not only his identity,
p337
aVit's a symbol of his income, because all of his assets are tied up in sheep.
p338
aVIn those days, nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds.
p339
aVYour assets are tied up in your flocks.
p340
aVSo it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income.
p341
aVAnd the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence.
p342
aVWhat do you do with a shepherd's staff?
p343
aVWell, you know, you move sheep from point A to point B with it,
p344
aVby hook or by crook.
p345
aVYou pull them or you poke them. One or the other.
p346
aVSo, he's saying,
p347
aV"You're going to lay down your identity.
p348
aVWhat's in your hand?
p349
aVYou've got identity, you've got income, you've got influence.
p350
aVWhat's in your hand?"
p351
aVAnd he's saying, "If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive.
p352
aVI'll do some things you could never imagine possible."
p353
aVAnd if you've watched that movie, "Ten Commandments,"
p354
aVall of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff.
p355
aa(lp356
VLast year, I was invited to speak at the NBA All-Stars game.
p357
aVAnd so, I'm talking to the players,
p358
aVbecause most of the NBA teams, NFL teams and all the other teams
p359
aVhave done this 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book.
p360
aVAnd I asked them, I said, "What's in your hand?
p361
aVSo, what's in your hand?" I said, "It's a basketball.
p362
aVAnd that basketball represents your identity, who you are:
p363
aVyou're an NBA player.
p364
aVIt represents your income:
p365
aVyou're making a lot of money off that little ball.
p366
aVAnd it represents your influence.
p367
aVAnd even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years,
p368
aVyou're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life.
p369
aVAnd that gives you enormous influence.
p370
aVSo, what are you going to do with what you've been given?"
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd I guess that's the main reason I came up here today,
p373
aVto all of you very bright people at TED \u2014
p374
aVit is to say, "What's in your hand?"
p375
aVWhat do you have that you've been given?
p376
aVTalent, background, education,
p377
aVfreedom, networks, opportunities,
p378
aVwealth, ideas, creativity.
p379
aVWhat are you doing with what you've been given?
p380
aVThat, to me, is the primary question about life.
p381
aVThat, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about.
p382
aVIn the book, I talk about how you're wired to do certain things,
p383
aVyou're "SHAPED" with \u2014 a little acrostic: Spiritual gifts, Heart,
p384
aVAbility, Personality and Experiences.
p385
aVThese things shape you.
p386
aVAnd if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life,
p387
aVyou need to look at your shape \u2014 "What am I wired to do?"
p388
aVWhy would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it?
p389
aVIf you're wired to be an anthropologist, you'll be an anthropologist.
p390
aVIf you're wired to be an undersea explorer,
p391
aVyou'll be an undersea explorer.
p392
aVIf you're wired to make deals, you make deals.
p393
aVIf you're wired to paint, you paint.

VDid you know that God smiles when you be you?
p396
aVWhen my little kids \u2014 when my kids were little \u2014
p397
aVthey're all grown now, I have grandkids \u2014
p398
aVI used to go in and sit on the side of their bed,
p399
aVand I used to watch my kids sleep.
p400
aVAnd I just watched their little bodies rise and lower, rise and lower.
p401
aVAnd I would look at them: "This is not an accident."
p402
aVRise and lower.
p403
aVAnd I got joy out of just watching them sleep.
p404
aVSome people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited
p405
aVwhen you're doing, quote, "spiritual things,"
p406
aVlike going to church or helping the poor,
p407
aVor, you know, confessing or doing something like that.
p408
aVThe bottom line is, God gets pleasure watching you be you.
p409
aVWhy? He made you.
p410
aVAnd when you do what you were made to do,
p411
aVhe goes, "That's my boy! That's my girl!
p412
aVYou're using the talent and ability that I gave you."
p413
aa(lp414
VSo my advice to you is:
p415
aVlook at what's in your hand \u2014
p416
aVyour identity, your influence, your income \u2014
p417
aVand say, "It's not about me.
p418
aVIt's about making the world a better place."
p419
aa(lp420
VThank you.

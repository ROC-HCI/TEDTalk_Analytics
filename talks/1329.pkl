VI'm going to start here.
p5
aVThis is a hand-lettered sign
p6
aVthat appeared in a mom and pop bakery
p7
aVin my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.
p8
aVThe store owned one of those machines
p9
aVthat can print on plates of sugar.
p10
aVAnd kids could bring in drawings
p11
aVand have the store print a sugar plate
p12
aVfor the top of their birthday cake.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to draw
p15
aVwas cartoon characters.
p16
aVThey liked to draw the Little Mermaid,
p17
aVthey'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.
p18
aVBut it turns out to be illegal
p19
aVto print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse
p20
aVonto a plate of sugar.
p21
aVAnd it's a copyright violation.
p22
aVAnd policing copyright violations
p23
aVfor children's birthday cakes
p24
aVwas such a hassle
p25
aVthat the College Bakery said,
p26
aV"You know what, we're getting out of that business.
p27
aVIf you're an amateur,
p28
aVyou don't have access to our machine anymore.
p29
aVIf you want a printed sugar birthday cake,
p30
aVyou have to use one of our prefab images \u2014
p31
aVonly for professionals."
p32
aa(lp33
VSo there's two bills in Congress right now.
p34
aVOne is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.
p35
aVSOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.
p36
aVIt's from the Senate.
p37
aVPIPA is short for PROTECTIP,
p38
aVwhich is itself short for
p39
aVPreventing Real Online Threats
p40
aVto Economic Creativity
p41
aVand Theft of Intellectual Property \u2014
p42
aVbecause the congressional aides who name these things
p43
aVhave a lot of time on their hands.
p44
aVAnd what SOPA and PIPA want to do
p45
aVis they want to do this.
p46
aVThey want to raise the cost
p47
aVof copyright compliance
p48
aVto the point where people simply get out of the business
p49
aVof offering it as a capability to amateurs.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow the way they propose to do this
p52
aVis to identify sites
p53
aVthat are substantially infringing on copyright \u2014
p54
aValthough how those sites are identified
p55
aVis never fully specified in the bills \u2014
p56
aVand then they want to remove them from the domain name system.
p57
aVThey want to take them out of the domain name system.
p58
aVNow the domain name system
p59
aVis the thing that turns human-readable names, like Google.com,
p60
aVinto the kinds of addresses
p61
aVmachines expect \u2014
p62
aV74.125.226.212.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow the problem with this model of censorship,
p65
aVof identifying a site
p66
aVand then trying to remove it from the domain name system,
p67
aVis that it won't work.
p68
aVAnd you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law,
p69
aVbut Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much.
p70
aVNow the reason it won't work
p71
aVis that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browser
p72
aVor you can make it a clickable link
p73
aVand you'll still go to Google.
p74
aVSo the policing layer
p75
aVaround the problem
p76
aVbecomes the real threat of the act.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow to understand how Congress came to write a bill
p79
aVthat won't accomplish its stated goals,
p80
aVbut will produce a lot of pernicious side effects,
p81
aVyou have to understand a little bit about the back story.
p82
aVAnd the back story is this:
p83
aVSOPA and PIPA, as legislation,
p84
aVwere drafted largely by media companies
p85
aVthat were founded in the 20th century.
p86
aVThe 20th century was a great time to be a media company,
p87
aVbecause the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.
p88
aVIf you were making a TV show,
p89
aVit didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made;
p90
aVit only had to be better
p91
aVthan the two other shows
p92
aVthat were on at the same time \u2014
p93
aVwhich is a very low threshold
p94
aVof competitive difficulty.
p95
aVWhich meant
p96
aVthat if you fielded average content,
p97
aVyou got a third of the U.S. public for free \u2014
p98
aVtens of millions of users
p99
aVfor simply doing something
p100
aVthat wasn't too terrible.
p101
aVThis is like having a license to print money
p102
aVand a barrel of free ink.
p103
aa(lp104
VBut technology moved on, as technology is wont to do.
p105
aVAnd slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century,
p106
aVthat scarcity started to get eroded \u2014
p107
aVand I don't mean by digital technology;
p108
aVI mean by analog technology.
p109
aVCassette tapes, video cassette recorders,
p110
aVeven the humble Xerox machine
p111
aVcreated new opportunities
p112
aVfor us to behave in ways
p113
aVthat astonished the media business.
p114
aVBecause it turned out
p115
aVwe're not really couch potatoes.
p116
aVWe don't really like to only consume.
p117
aVWe do like to consume,
p118
aVbut every time one of these new tools came along,
p119
aVit turned out we also like to produce
p120
aVand we like to share.
p121
aVAnd this freaked the media businesses out \u2014
p122
aVit freaked them out every time.
p123
aVJack Valenti, who was the head lobbyist
p124
aVfor the Motion Picture Association of America,
p125
aVonce likened the ferocious video cassette recorder
p126
aVto Jack the Ripper
p127
aVand poor, helpless Hollywood
p128
aVto a woman at home alone.
p129
aVThat was the level of rhetoric.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd so the media industries
p132
aVbegged, insisted, demanded
p133
aVthat Congress do something.
p134
aVAnd Congress did something.
p135
aVBy the early 90s, Congress passed the law
p136
aVthat changed everything.
p137
aVAnd that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act
p138
aVof 1992.
p139
aVWhat the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was,
p140
aVlook, if people are taping stuff off the radio
p141
aVand then making mixtapes for their friends,
p142
aVthat is not a crime. That's okay.
p143
aVTaping and remixing
p144
aVand sharing with your friends is okay.
p145
aVIf you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them,
p146
aVthat's not okay.
p147
aVBut this taping business,
p148
aVfine, let it go.
p149
aVAnd they thought that they clarified the issue,
p150
aVbecause they'd set out a clear distinction
p151
aVbetween legal and illegal copying.
p152
aa(lp153
VBut that wasn't what the media businesses wanted.
p154
aVThey had wanted Congress
p155
aVto outlaw copying full-stop.
p156
aVSo when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed,
p157
aVthe media businesses gave up on the idea
p158
aVof legal versus illegal distinctions for copying
p159
aVbecause it was clear
p160
aVthat if Congress was acting in their framework,
p161
aVthey might actually increase the rights of citizens
p162
aVto participate in our own media environment.
p163
aVSo they went for plan B.
p164
aVIt took them a while to formulate plan B.
p165
aa(lp166
VPlan B appeared in its first full-blown form
p167
aVin 1998 \u2014
p168
aVsomething called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
p169
aVIt was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.
p170
aVBut the main thrust of the DMCA
p171
aVwas that it was legal to sell you
p172
aVuncopyable digital material \u2014
p173
aVexcept that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material.
p174
aVIt would be, as Ed Felton once famously said,
p175
aV"Like handing out water
p176
aVthat wasn't wet."
p177
aVBits are copyable. That's what computers do.
p178
aVThat is a side effect of their ordinary operation.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo in order to fake the ability
p181
aVto sell uncopyable bits,
p182
aVthe DMCA also made it legal
p183
aVto force you to use systems
p184
aVthat broke the copying function of your devices.
p185
aVEvery DVD player and game player
p186
aVand television and computer you brought home \u2014
p187
aVno matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it \u2014
p188
aVcould be broken by the content industries,
p189
aVif they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.
p190
aVAnd to make sure you didn't realize,
p191
aVor didn't enact their capabilities
p192
aVas general purpose computing devices,
p193
aVthey also made it illegal
p194
aVfor you to try to reset
p195
aVthe copyability of that content.
p196
aVThe DMCA marks the moment
p197
aVwhen the media industries
p198
aVgave up on the legal system
p199
aVof distinguishing between legal and illegal copying
p200
aVand simply tried to prevent copying
p201
aVthrough technical means.
p202
aa(lp203
VNow the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects,
p204
aVbut in this one domain, limiting sharing,
p205
aVit has mostly not worked.
p206
aVAnd the main reason it hasn't worked
p207
aVis the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful
p208
aVthan anyone imagined.
p209
aVThe mixtape, the fanzine,
p210
aVthat was nothing compared to what we're seeing now
p211
aVwith the Internet.
p212
aVWe are in a world
p213
aVwhere most American citizens
p214
aVover the age of 12
p215
aVshare things with each other online.
p216
aVWe share written things, we share images,
p217
aVwe share audio, we share video.
p218
aVSome of the stuff we share is stuff we've made.
p219
aVSome of the stuff we share is stuff we've found.
p220
aVSome of the stuff we share
p221
aVis stuff we've made out of what we've found,
p222
aVand all of it horrifies those industries.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo PIPA and SOPA
p225
aVare round two.
p226
aVBut where the DMCA was surgical \u2014
p227
aVwe want to go down into your computer,
p228
aVwe want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine,
p229
aVand prevent it from doing
p230
aVwhat they said it would do at the store \u2014
p231
aVPIPA and SOPA are nuclear
p232
aVand they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world
p233
aVand censor content.
p234
aVNow the mechanism, as I said, for doing this,
p235
aVis you need to take out anybody
p236
aVpointing to those IP addresses.
p237
aVYou need to take them out of search engines,
p238
aVyou need to take them out of online directories,
p239
aVyou need to take them out of user lists.
p240
aVAnd because the biggest producers of content on the Internet
p241
aVare not Google and Yahoo,
p242
aVthey're us,
p243
aVwe're the people getting policed.
p244
aVBecause in the end,
p245
aVthe real threat
p246
aVto the enactment of PIPA and SOPA
p247
aVis our ability to share things with one another.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo what PIPA and SOPA risk doing
p250
aVis taking a centuries-old legal concept,
p251
aVinnocent until proven guilty,
p252
aVand reversing it \u2014
p253
aVguilty until proven innocent.
p254
aVYou can't share
p255
aVuntil you show us
p256
aVthat you're not sharing something
p257
aVwe don't like.
p258
aVSuddenly, the burden of proof for legal versus illegal
p259
aVfalls affirmatively on us
p260
aVand on the services
p261
aVthat might be offering us any new capabilities.
p262
aVAnd if it costs even a dime
p263
aVto police a user,
p264
aVthat will crush a service
p265
aVwith a hundred million users.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo this is the Internet they have in mind.
p268
aVImagine this sign everywhere \u2014
p269
aVexcept imagine it doesn't say College Bakery,
p270
aVimagine it says YouTube
p271
aVand Facebook and Twitter.
p272
aVImagine it says TED,
p273
aVbecause the comments can't be policed
p274
aVat any acceptable cost.
p275
aVThe real effects of SOPA and PIPA
p276
aVare going to be different than the proposed effects.
p277
aVThe threat, in fact,
p278
aVis this inversion of the burden of proof,
p279
aVwhere we suddenly
p280
aVare all treated like thieves
p281
aVat every moment we're given the freedom to create,
p282
aVto produce or to share.
p283
aVAnd the people who provide those capabilities to us \u2014
p284
aVthe YouTubes, the Facebooks, the Twitters and TEDs \u2014
p285
aVare in the business
p286
aVof having to police us,
p287
aVor being on the hook for contributory infringement.
p288
aa(lp289
VThere's two things you can do
p290
aVto help stop this \u2014
p291
aVa simple thing and a complicated thing,
p292
aVan easy thing and a hard thing.
p293
aVThe simple thing, the easy thing, is this:
p294
aVif you're an American citizen,
p295
aVcall your representative, call your senator.
p296
aVWhen you look at
p297
aVthe people who co-signed on the SOPA bill,
p298
aVpeople who've co-signed on PIPA,
p299
aVwhat you see is that they have cumulatively received
p300
aVmillions and millions of dollars
p301
aVfrom the traditional media industries.
p302
aVYou don't have millions and millions of dollars,
p303
aVbut you can call your representatives,
p304
aVand you can remind them that you vote,
p305
aVand you can ask not to be treated like a thief,
p306
aVand you can suggest that you would prefer
p307
aVthat the Internet not be broken.
p308
aa(lp309
VAnd if you're not an American citizen,
p310
aVyou can contact American citizens that you know
p311
aVand encourage them to do the same.
p312
aVBecause this seems like a national issue,
p313
aVbut it is not.
p314
aVThese industries will not be content
p315
aVwith breaking our Internet.
p316
aVIf they break it, they will break it for everybody.
p317
aVThat's the easy thing.
p318
aVThat's the simple thing.
p319
aa(lp320
VThe hard thing is this:
p321
aVget ready, because more is coming.
p322
aVSOPA is simply a reversion of COICA,
p323
aVwhich was purposed last year, which did not pass.
p324
aVAnd all of this goes back
p325
aVto the failure of the DMCA
p326
aVto disallow sharing as a technical means.
p327
aVAnd the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act,
p328
aVwhich horrified those industries.
p329
aVBecause the whole business
p330
aVof actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law
p331
aVand then gathering evidence and proving that,
p332
aVthat turns out to be really inconvenient.
p333
aV"We'd prefer not to do that,"
p334
aVsays the content industries.
p335
aVAnd what they want is not to have to do that.
p336
aVThey don't want legal distinctions
p337
aVbetween legal and illegal sharing.
p338
aVThey just want the sharing to go away.
p339
aa(lp340
VPIPA and SOPA are not oddities, they're not anomalies,
p341
aVthey're not events.
p342
aVThey're the next turn of this particular screw,
p343
aVwhich has been going on 20 years now.
p344
aVAnd if we defeat these, as I hope we do,
p345
aVmore is coming.
p346
aVBecause until we convince Congress
p347
aVthat the way to deal with copyright violation
p348
aVis the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster, with YouTube,
p349
aVwhich is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence
p350
aVand the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies
p351
aVthat goes on in democratic societies.
p352
aVThat's the way to handle this.
p353
aa(lp354
VIn the meantime,
p355
aVthe hard thing to do is to be ready.
p356
aVBecause that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA.
p357
aVTime Warner has called
p358
aVand they want us all back on the couch,
p359
aVjust consuming \u2014
p360
aVnot producing, not sharing \u2014
p361
aVand we should say, "No."
p362
aa(lp363
VThank you.

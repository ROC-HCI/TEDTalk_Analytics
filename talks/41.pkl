VI've been at MIT for 44 years.
p5
aVI went to TED I.
p6
aVThere's only one other person here, I think, who did that.
p7
aVAll the other TEDs \u2014
p8
aVand I went to them all, under Ricky's regime \u2014
p9
aVI talked about what the Media Lab was doing,
p10
aVwhich today has almost 500 people in it.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd if you read the press,
p13
aVlast week it actually said I quit the Media Lab.
p14
aVI didn't quit the Media Lab, I stepped down as chairman \u2014
p15
aVwhich was a kind of ridiculous title, but someone else has taken it on \u2014
p16
aVand one of the things you can do as a professor
p17
aVis you stay on as a professor.
p18
aVAnd I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child,
p19
aVwhich I've sort of been doing for a year and a half, anyway.
p20
aVSo I'm going to tell you about this,
p21
aVuse my 18 minutes to tell you why we're doing it,
p22
aVhow we're doing it and then what we're doing.
p23
aVAnd at some point I'll even pass around
p24
aVwhat the $100 laptop might be like.
p25
aa(lp26
VI was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues,
p27
aVand so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this.
p28
aVAnd the first is pretty obvious.
p29
aVIt's amazing when you meet a head of state, and you say,
p30
aV"What is your most precious natural resource?"
p31
aVThey will not say "children" at first,
p32
aVand then when you say, "children," they will pretty quickly agree with you.
p33
aVAnd so that isn't very hard.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VEverybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems,
p38
aVthey include education, sometimes can be just education
p39
aVand can never be without some element of education.
p40
aVSo that's certainly part of it.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd the third is a little bit less obvious.
p43
aVAnd that is that we all in this room learned how to walk, how to talk,
p44
aVnot by being taught how to talk, or taught how to walk,
p45
aVbut by interacting with the world,
p46
aVby having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something,
p47
aVor being able to stand up and reach it.
p48
aVWhereas at about the age six, we were told to stop learning that way,
p49
aVand that all learning from then on would happen through teaching,
p50
aVwhether it's people standing up, like I'm doing now,
p51
aVor a book, or something.
p52
aVBut it was really through teaching.
p53
aVAnd one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning
p54
aVis that it now includes a kind of learning
p55
aVwhich is a little bit more like walking and talking,
p56
aVin the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo with those as the principles \u2014
p59
aVsome of you may know Seymour Papert.
p60
aVThis is back in 1982, when we were working in Senegal.
p61
aVBecause some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago,
p62
aVor two years ago, or we were struck by lightning \u2014
p63
aVthis actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s.
p64
aVHere we're in the '80s.
p65
aVSteve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal.
p66
aVIt didn't scale
p67
aVbut it at least was bringing computers to developing countries
p68
aVand learning pretty quickly that these kids,
p69
aVeven though English wasn't their language,
p70
aVthe Latin alphabet barely was their language,
p71
aVbut they could just swim like fish.
p72
aVThey could play these like pianos.
p73
aa(lp74
VA little bit more recently, I got involved personally.
p75
aVAnd these are two anecdotes \u2014
p76
aVone was in Cambodia,
p77
aVin a village that has no electricity, no water, no television, no telephone,
p78
aVbut has broadband Internet now.
p79
aVAnd these kids, their first English word is "Google"
p80
aVand they only know Skype.
p81
aVThey've never heard of telephony.
p82
aVThey just use Skype.
p83
aVAnd they go home at night \u2014
p84
aVthey've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity.
p85
aVThe parents love it, because when they open up the laptops,
p86
aVit's the brightest light source in the house.
p87
aVAnd talk about where metaphors and reality mix \u2014
p88
aVthis is the actual school.
p89
aa(lp90
VIn parallel with this, Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine
p91
aVto legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002.
p92
aVNow at the time, I think it's fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were \u2014
p93
aVlet me say, apprehensive.
p94
aVReally, they were actually against it.
p95
aVAnd they really preferred that the money would be used
p96
aVfor higher salaries, more schools, whatever.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd now, three and a half years later, guess what?
p99
aVThey're reporting five things: drop of truancy to almost zero,
p100
aVattending parent-teacher meetings \u2014
p101
aVwhich nobody did and now almost everybody does \u2014
p102
aVdrop in discipline problems, increase in student participation.
p103
aVTeachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach.
p104
aVKids are engaged \u2014 they have laptops! \u2014
p105
aVand then the fifth, which interests me the most,
p106
aVis that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night
p107
aVbecause the teachers are getting too much email
p108
aVfrom the kids asking them for help.
p109
aVSo when you see that kind of thing \u2014
p110
aVthis is not something that you have to test.
p111
aVThe days of pilot projects are over, when people say,
p112
aV"We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works."
p113
aVScrew you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it,
p114
aVand then when you figure out that this works, you can join as well.
p115
aVAnd this is what we're doing.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago.
p120
aVIt's a nonprofit association.
p121
aVIt raised about 20 million dollars
p122
aVto do the engineering to just get this built,
p123
aVand then have it produced afterwards.
p124
aVScale is truly important.
p125
aVAnd it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK?
p126
aVIt's because you can go to a manufacturer \u2014
p127
aVand I will leave the name out \u2014
p128
aVbut we wanted a small display,
p129
aVdoesn't have to have perfect color uniformity.
p130
aVIt can even have a pixel or two missing.
p131
aVIt doesn't have to be that bright.
p132
aVAnd this particular manufacturer said,
p133
aV"We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room.
p134
aVWe're interested in perfect color uniformity.
p135
aVWe're interested in big displays, bright displays.
p136
aVYou're not part of our strategic plan."
p137
aVAnd I said, "That's kind of too bad, because we need 100 million units a year."
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd they said, "Oh, well, maybe we could become part of your strategic plan."
p142
aVAnd that's why scale counts.
p143
aVAnd that's why we will not launch this
p144
aVwithout five to 10 million units in the first run.
p145
aVAnd the idea is to launch with enough scale
p146
aVthat the scale itself helps bring the price down,
p147
aVand that's why I said seven to 10 million there.
p148
aVAnd we're doing it without a sales-and-marketing team.
p149
aVI mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team.
p150
aVWe will do it by going to seven large countries
p151
aVand getting them to agree and launch it,
p152
aVand then the others can follow.
p153
aVWe have partners.
p154
aVIt's not hard to guess Google would be one.
p155
aVThe others are all playing to pending.
p156
aVAnd this has been in the press a great deal.
p157
aVIt's the so-called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan
p158
aVin November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow once people start looking at this, they say, "Ah, this is a laptop project."
p161
aVWell, no, it's not a laptop project. It's an education project.
p162
aVAnd the fun part \u2014 and I'm quite focused on it \u2014
p163
aVI tell people I used to be a light bulb, but now I'm a laser \u2014
p164
aVI'm just going to get that thing built, and it turns out it's not so hard.
p165
aVBecause laptop economics are the following:
p166
aVI say 50 percent here \u2014 it's more like 60,
p167
aV60 percent of the cost of your laptop
p168
aVis sales, marketing, distribution and profit.
p169
aVNow we have none of those, OK?
p170
aVNone of those figure into our cost,
p171
aVbecause first of all, we sell it at cost, and the governments distribute it.
p172
aVIt gets distributed to the school system like a textbook.
p173
aVSo that piece disappears.
p174
aVThen you have display and everything else.
p175
aVNow the display on your laptop costs,
p176
aVin rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch.
p177
aVThat can drop to eight; it can drop to seven
p178
aVbut it's not going to drop to two, or to one and a half,
p179
aVunless we do some pretty clever things.
p180
aVIt's the rest \u2014 that little brown box \u2014 that is pretty fascinating,
p181
aVbecause the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself.
p182
aVIt's a little bit like an obese person
p183
aVhaving to use most of their energy to move their obesity.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd we have a situation today which is incredible.
p188
aVI've been using laptops since their inception.
p189
aVAnd my laptop runs slower, less reliably and less pleasantly
p190
aVthan it ever has before.
p191
aVAnd this year is worse.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VPeople clap, sometimes you even get standing ovations,
p196
aVand I say, "What the hell's wrong with you? Why are we all sitting there?"
p197
aVAnd somebody \u2014 to remain nameless \u2014 called our laptop a "gadget" recently.
p198
aVAnd I said, "God, our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell.
p199
aVWhen you open it up, it's going to go 'bing.'"
p200
aVIt'll be on.
p201
aVIt'll be just like it was in 1985,
p202
aVwhen you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.
p203
aVIt worked really well.
p204
aVAnd we've been going steadily downhill.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, people ask all the time what it is.
p207
aVThat's what it is.
p208
aVThe two pieces that are probably notable: it'll be a mesh network,
p209
aVso when the kids open up their laptops, they all become a network,
p210
aVand then just need one or two points of backhaul.
p211
aVYou can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits.
p212
aVSo you really can bring into a village,
p213
aVand then the villages can connect themselves,
p214
aVand you really can do it quite well.
p215
aa(lp216
VThe dual mode display \u2014
p217
aVthe idea is to have a display that both works outdoors \u2014
p218
aVisn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight?
p219
aVWell, you can't see it.
p220
aVAnd one of the reasons you can't see it
p221
aVis because it's backlighting most of the time, most cell phones.
p222
aVNow, what we're doing is, we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit.
p223
aVAnd whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software
p224
aVis to be seen.
p225
aVBut when it's backlit, it's color.
p226
aVAnd when it's frontlit, it's black and white
p227
aVat three times the resolution.
p228
aa(lp229
VIs it all worked out? No.
p230
aVThat's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now.
p231
aVAnd in about 30 days, we'll know for sure whether this works.
p232
aVProbably the most important piece there
p233
aVis that the kids really can do the maintenance.
p234
aVAnd this is again something that people don't believe,
p235
aVbut I really think it's quite true.
p236
aVThat's the machine we showed in Tunis.
p237
aVThis is more the direction that we're going to go.
p238
aVAnd it's something that we didn't think was possible.
p239
aVNow, I'm going to pass this around.
p240
aVThis isn't a design, OK?
p241
aVSo this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it
p242
aVfor you to play with.
p243
aVAnd it's clearly just a model.
p244
aVThe working one is at MIT.
p245
aVI'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman.
p246
aVAt least you can decide whether it goes left or \u2014
p247
aa(lp248
VChris Anderson: Before you do it, for the people down in simulcast \u2014
p249
aa(lp250
VNicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot. CA: Just show it off a bit.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo wherever the camera is \u2014 OK, good point. Thank you, Chris.
p253
aa(lp254
VThe idea was that it would be not only a laptop,
p255
aVbut that it could transform into an electronic book.
p256
aVSo it's sort of an electronic book.
p257
aVThis is where when you go outside, it's in black and white.
p258
aVThe games buttons are missing,
p259
aVbut it'll also be a games machine,
p260
aVbook machine.
p261
aVSet it up this way, and it's a television set.
p262
aVEtc., etc. \u2014 is that enough for simulcast? OK, sorry.
p263
aVI'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards.
p264
aVOK. Seven countries.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VI say "maybe" for Massachusetts, because they actually have to do a bid.
p269
aVBy law you've got to bid, and so on and so forth.
p270
aVSo I can't quite name them.
p271
aVIn the other cases, they don't have to do bids.
p272
aVThey can decide \u2014
p273
aVit's the federal government in each case.
p274
aVIt's kind of agonizing,
p275
aVbecause a lot of people say, "Let's do it at the state level,"
p276
aVbecause states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size.
p277
aVAnd yet we count.
p278
aVWe're really dealing with the federal government.
p279
aVWe're really dealing with ministries of education.
p280
aVAnd if you look at governments around the world,
p281
aVministries of education tend to be the most conservative,
p282
aVand also the ones that have huge payrolls.
p283
aVEverybody thinks they know about education,
p284
aVa lot of culture is built into it as well.
p285
aVIt's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road.
p286
aVIf you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed.
p287
aa(lp288
VHave they all agreed? No, not completely.
p289
aVProbably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria
p290
aVare the three that are the most active and most agreed.
p291
aVWe're purposely not signing anything with anybody
p292
aVuntil we actually have the working ones.
p293
aVAnd since I visit each one of those countries
p294
aVwithin at least every three months,
p295
aVI'm just going around the world every three weeks.
p296
aVHere's sort of the schedule
p297
aVand I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting.
p298
aVEverybody says it's a $100 laptop \u2014
p299
aVyou can't do it.
p300
aVWell, guess what, we're not.
p301
aVWe're coming in probably at 135, to start, then drift down.
p302
aVAnd that's very important,
p303
aVbecause so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up.
p304
aVIt's kind of the loss leader,
p305
aVand then as soon as it looks interesting,
p306
aVit can't be afforded, or it can't be scaled out.
p307
aVSo we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010.
p308
aa(lp309
VThe gray market's a big issue.
p310
aVAnd one of the ways \u2014 just one \u2014
p311
aVbut one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market
p312
aVis to make something that is so utterly unique \u2014
p313
aVIt's a little bit like the fact that automobiles \u2014
p314
aVthousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States.
p315
aVNot one single post-office truck is stolen.
p316
aa(lp317
V(Laughter)
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd why?
p320
aVBecause there's no market for post-office trucks.
p321
aVIt looks like a post-office truck.
p322
aVYou can spray paint it. You can do anything you want.
p323
aVI just learned recently: in South Africa, no white Volvos are stolen.
p324
aVPeriod. None. Zero.
p325
aVSo we want to make it very much like a white Volvo.
p326
aa(lp327
VEach government has a task force.
p328
aVThis perhaps is less interesting,
p329
aVbut we're trying to get the governments to all work together
p330
aVand it's not easy.
p331
aVThe economics of this is to start with the federal governments
p332
aVand then later, to subsequently go to other \u2014
p333
aVwhether it's child-to-child funding,
p334
aVso a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world,
p335
aVmaybe of the same gender, maybe of the same age.
p336
aVAn uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present.
p337
aVI mean, there are all sorts of things that will happen,
p338
aVand they'll be very, very exciting.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd everybody says \u2014 I say \u2014 it's an education project.
p341
aVAre we providing the software?
p342
aVThe answer is:
p343
aVThe system certainly has software,
p344
aVbut no, we're not providing the education content.
p345
aVThat is really done in the countries.
p346
aVBut we are certainly constructionists.
p347
aVAnd we certainly believe in learning by doing
p348
aVand everything from Logo, which was started in 1968,
p349
aVto more modern things, like Scratch, if you've ever even heard of it,
p350
aVare very, very much part of it.
p351
aVAnd that's the rollout.
p352
aa(lp353
VAre we dreaming? Is this real?
p354
aVIt actually is real.
p355
aVThe only criticism, and people really don't want to criticize this,
p356
aVbecause it is a humanitarian effort, a nonprofit effort
p357
aVand to criticize it is a little bit stupid, actually.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Laughter)
p360
aa(lp361
VBut the one thing that people could criticize was,
p362
aV"Great idea, but these guys can't do it."
p363
aVAnd that could either mean these guys, professors and so on couldn't do it,
p364
aVor that it's not possible.
p365
aVWell, on December 12, a company called Quanta agreed to build it,
p366
aVand since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today,
p367
aVthat question disappeared.
p368
aVSo it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen.
p369
aVIt is going to happen.
p370
aVAnd if it comes out at 138 dollars, so what?
p371
aVIf it comes out six months late, so what?
p372
aVThat's a pretty soft landing.
p373
aa(lp374
VThank you.

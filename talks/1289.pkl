VMy subject today is learning.
p5
aVAnd in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.
p6
aVReady?
p7
aVWhen does learning begin?
p8
aVNow as you ponder that question,
p9
aVmaybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool
p10
aVor kindergarten,
p11
aVthe first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.
p12
aVOr maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase
p13
aVwhen children are learning how to walk and talk
p14
aVand use a fork.
p15
aVMaybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,
p16
aVwhich asserts that the most important years for learning
p17
aVare the earliest ones.
p18
aVAnd so your answer to my question would be:
p19
aVLearning begins at birth.
p20
aa(lp21
VWell today I want to present to you
p22
aVan idea that may be surprising
p23
aVand may even seem implausible,
p24
aVbut which is supported by the latest evidence
p25
aVfrom psychology and biology.
p26
aVAnd that is that some of the most important learning we ever do
p27
aVhappens before we're born,
p28
aVwhile we're still in the womb.
p29
aVNow I'm a science reporter.
p30
aVI write books and magazine articles.
p31
aVAnd I'm also a mother.
p32
aVAnd those two roles came together for me
p33
aVin a book that I wrote called "Origins."
p34
aV"Origins" is a report from the front lines
p35
aVof an exciting new field
p36
aVcalled fetal origins.
p37
aVFetal origins is a scientific discipline
p38
aVthat emerged just about two decades ago,
p39
aVand it's based on the theory
p40
aVthat our health and well-being throughout our lives
p41
aVis crucially affected
p42
aVby the nine months we spend in the womb.
p43
aVNow this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.
p44
aVI was myself pregnant
p45
aVwhile I was doing the research for the book.
p46
aVAnd one of the most fascinating insights
p47
aVI took from this work
p48
aVis that we're all learning about the world
p49
aVeven before we enter it.
p50
aa(lp51
VWhen we hold our babies for the first time,
p52
aVwe might imagine that they're clean slates,
p53
aVunmarked by life,
p54
aVwhen in fact, they've already been shaped by us
p55
aVand by the particular world we live in.
p56
aVToday I want to share with you some of the amazing things
p57
aVthat scientists are discovering
p58
aVabout what fetuses learn
p59
aVwhile they're still in their mothers' bellies.
p60
aa(lp61
VFirst of all,
p62
aVthey learn the sound of their mothers' voices.
p63
aVBecause sounds from the outside world
p64
aVhave to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue
p65
aVand through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus,
p66
aVthe voices fetuses hear,
p67
aVstarting around the fourth month of gestation,
p68
aVare muted and muffled.
p69
aVOne researcher says
p70
aVthat they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher
p71
aVin the old "Peanuts" cartoon.
p72
aVBut the pregnant woman's own voice
p73
aVreverberates through her body,
p74
aVreaching the fetus much more readily.
p75
aVAnd because the fetus is with her all the time,
p76
aVit hears her voice a lot.
p77
aVOnce the baby's born, it recognizes her voice
p78
aVand it prefers listening to her voice
p79
aVover anyone else's.
p80
aa(lp81
VHow can we know this?
p82
aVNewborn babies can't do much,
p83
aVbut one thing they're really good at is sucking.
p84
aVResearchers take advantage of this fact
p85
aVby rigging up two rubber nipples,
p86
aVso that if a baby sucks on one,
p87
aVit hears a recording of its mother's voice
p88
aVon a pair of headphones,
p89
aVand if it sucks on the other nipple,
p90
aVit hears a recording of a female stranger's voice.
p91
aVBabies quickly show their preference
p92
aVby choosing the first one.
p93
aVScientists also take advantage of the fact
p94
aVthat babies will slow down their sucking
p95
aVwhen something interests them
p96
aVand resume their fast sucking
p97
aVwhen they get bored.
p98
aVThis is how researchers discovered
p99
aVthat, after women repeatedly read aloud
p100
aVa section of Dr. Seuss' "The Cat in the Hat" while they were pregnant,
p101
aVtheir newborn babies recognized that passage
p102
aVwhen they hear it outside the womb.
p103
aVMy favorite experiment of this kind
p104
aVis the one that showed that the babies
p105
aVof women who watched a certain soap opera
p106
aVevery day during pregnancy
p107
aVrecognized the theme song of that show
p108
aVonce they were born.
p109
aVSo fetuses are even learning
p110
aVabout the particular language that's spoken
p111
aVin the world that they'll be born into.
p112
aa(lp113
VA study published last year
p114
aVfound that from birth, from the moment of birth,
p115
aVbabies cry in the accent
p116
aVof their mother's native language.
p117
aVFrench babies cry on a rising note
p118
aVwhile German babies end on a falling note,
p119
aVimitating the melodic contours
p120
aVof those languages.
p121
aVNow why would this kind of fetal learning
p122
aVbe useful?
p123
aVIt may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.
p124
aVFrom the moment of birth,
p125
aVthe baby responds most to the voice
p126
aVof the person who is most likely to care for it \u2014
p127
aVits mother.
p128
aVIt even makes its cries
p129
aVsound like the mother's language,
p130
aVwhich may further endear the baby to the mother,
p131
aVand which may give the baby a head start
p132
aVin the critical task
p133
aVof learning how to understand and speak
p134
aVits native language.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut it's not just sounds
p137
aVthat fetuses are learning about in utero.
p138
aVIt's also tastes and smells.
p139
aVBy seven months of gestation,
p140
aVthe fetus' taste buds are fully developed,
p141
aVand its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell,
p142
aVare functioning.
p143
aVThe flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats
p144
aVfind their way into the amniotic fluid,
p145
aVwhich is continuously swallowed
p146
aVby the fetus.
p147
aVBabies seem to remember and prefer these tastes
p148
aVonce they're out in the world.
p149
aVIn one experiment, a group of pregnant women
p150
aVwas asked to drink a lot of carrot juice
p151
aVduring their third trimester of pregnancy,
p152
aVwhile another group of pregnant women
p153
aVdrank only water.
p154
aVSix months later, the women's infants
p155
aVwere offered cereal mixed with carrot juice,
p156
aVand their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.
p157
aVThe offspring of the carrot juice drinking women
p158
aVate more carrot-flavored cereal,
p159
aVand from the looks of it,
p160
aVthey seemed to enjoy it more.
p161
aa(lp162
VA sort of French version of this experiment
p163
aVwas carried out in Dijon, France
p164
aVwhere researchers found
p165
aVthat mothers who consumed food and drink
p166
aVflavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy
p167
aVshowed a preference for anise
p168
aVon their first day of life,
p169
aVand again, when they were tested later,
p170
aVon their fourth day of life.
p171
aVBabies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy
p172
aVshowed a reaction that translated roughly as "yuck."
p173
aVWhat this means
p174
aVis that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers
p175
aVabout what is safe and good to eat.
p176
aVFetuses are also being taught
p177
aVabout the particular culture that they'll be joining
p178
aVthrough one of culture's most powerful expressions,
p179
aVwhich is food.
p180
aVThey're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices
p181
aVof their culture's cuisine
p182
aVeven before birth.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.
p185
aVBut before I get to that,
p186
aVI want to address something that you may be wondering about.
p187
aVThe notion of fetal learning
p188
aVmay conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus \u2014
p189
aVlike playing Mozart through headphones
p190
aVplaced on a pregnant belly.
p191
aVBut actually, the nine-month-long process
p192
aVof molding and shaping that goes on in the womb
p193
aVis a lot more visceral and consequential than that.
p194
aVMuch of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life \u2014
p195
aVthe air she breathes,
p196
aVthe food and drink she consumes,
p197
aVthe chemicals she's exposed to,
p198
aVeven the emotions she feels \u2014
p199
aVare shared in some fashion with her fetus.
p200
aVThey make up a mix of influences
p201
aVas individual and idiosyncratic
p202
aVas the woman herself.
p203
aVThe fetus incorporates these offerings
p204
aVinto its own body,
p205
aVmakes them part of its flesh and blood.
p206
aVAnd often it does something more.
p207
aVIt treats these maternal contributions
p208
aVas information,
p209
aVas what I like to call biological postcards
p210
aVfrom the world outside.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo what a fetus is learning about in utero
p213
aVis not Mozart's "Magic Flute"
p214
aVbut answers to questions much more critical to its survival.
p215
aVWill it be born into a world of abundance
p216
aVor scarcity?
p217
aVWill it be safe and protected,
p218
aVor will it face constant dangers and threats?
p219
aVWill it live a long, fruitful life
p220
aVor a short, harried one?
p221
aVThe pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular
p222
aVprovide important clues to prevailing conditions
p223
aVlike a finger lifted to the wind.
p224
aVThe resulting tuning and tweaking
p225
aVof a fetus' brain and other organs
p226
aVare part of what give us humans
p227
aVour enormous flexibility,
p228
aVour ability to thrive
p229
aVin a huge variety of environments,
p230
aVfrom the country to the city,
p231
aVfrom the tundra to the desert.
p232
aa(lp233
VTo conclude, I want to tell you two stories
p234
aVabout how mothers teach their children about the world
p235
aVeven before they're born.
p236
aVIn the autumn of 1944,
p237
aVthe darkest days of World War II,
p238
aVGerman troops blockaded Western Holland,
p239
aVturning away all shipments of food.
p240
aVThe opening of the Nazi's siege
p241
aVwas followed by one of the harshest winters in decades \u2014
p242
aVso cold the water in the canals froze solid.
p243
aVSoon food became scarce,
p244
aVwith many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day \u2014
p245
aVa quarter of what they consumed before the war.
p246
aVAs weeks of deprivation stretched into months,
p247
aVsome resorted to eating tulip bulbs.
p248
aVBy the beginning of May,
p249
aVthe nation's carefully rationed food reserve
p250
aVwas completely exhausted.
p251
aVThe specter of mass starvation loomed.
p252
aVAnd then on May 5th, 1945,
p253
aVthe siege came to a sudden end
p254
aVwhen Holland was liberated
p255
aVby the Allies.
p256
aa(lp257
VThe "Hunger Winter," as it came to be known,
p258
aVkilled some 10,000 people
p259
aVand weakened thousands more.
p260
aVBut there was another population that was affected \u2014
p261
aVthe 40,000 fetuses
p262
aVin utero during the siege.
p263
aVSome of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy
p264
aVwere immediately apparent
p265
aVin higher rates of stillbirths,
p266
aVbirth defects, low birth weights
p267
aVand infant mortality.
p268
aVBut others wouldn't be discovered for many years.
p269
aVDecades after the "Hunger Winter,"
p270
aVresearchers documented
p271
aVthat people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege
p272
aVhave more obesity, more diabetes
p273
aVand more heart disease in later life
p274
aVthan individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.
p275
aVThese individuals' prenatal experience of starvation
p276
aVseems to have changed their bodies
p277
aVin myriad ways.
p278
aVThey have higher blood pressure,
p279
aVpoorer cholesterol profiles
p280
aVand reduced glucose tolerance \u2014
p281
aVa precursor of diabetes.
p282
aa(lp283
VWhy would undernutrition in the womb
p284
aVresult in disease later?
p285
aVOne explanation
p286
aVis that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.
p287
aVWhen food is scarce,
p288
aVthey divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain,
p289
aVand away from other organs
p290
aVlike the heart and liver.
p291
aVThis keeps the fetus alive in the short-term,
p292
aVbut the bill comes due later on in life
p293
aVwhen those other organs, deprived early on,
p294
aVbecome more susceptible to disease.
p295
aa(lp296
VBut that may not be all that's going on.
p297
aVIt seems that fetuses are taking cues
p298
aVfrom the intrauterine environment
p299
aVand tailoring their physiology accordingly.
p300
aVThey're preparing themselves
p301
aVfor the kind of world they will encounter
p302
aVon the other side of the womb.
p303
aVThe fetus adjusts its metabolism
p304
aVand other physiological processes
p305
aVin anticipation of the environment that awaits it.
p306
aVAnd the basis of the fetus' prediction
p307
aVis what its mother eats.
p308
aVThe meals a pregnant woman consumes
p309
aVconstitute a kind of story,
p310
aVa fairy tale of abundance
p311
aVor a grim chronicle of deprivation.
p312
aVThis story imparts information
p313
aVthat the fetus uses
p314
aVto organize its body and its systems \u2014
p315
aVan adaptation to prevailing circumstances
p316
aVthat facilitates its future survival.
p317
aVFaced with severely limited resources,
p318
aVa smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements
p319
aVwill, in fact, have a better chance
p320
aVof living to adulthood.
p321
aa(lp322
VThe real trouble comes
p323
aVwhen pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators,
p324
aVwhen fetuses are led
p325
aVto expect a world of scarcity
p326
aVand are born instead into a world of plenty.
p327
aVThis is what happened to the children of the Dutch "Hunger Winter."
p328
aVAnd their higher rates of obesity,
p329
aVdiabetes and heart disease
p330
aVare the result.
p331
aVBodies that were built to hang onto every calorie
p332
aVfound themselves swimming in the superfluous calories
p333
aVof the post-war Western diet.
p334
aVThe world they had learned about while in utero
p335
aVwas not the same
p336
aVas the world into which they were born.
p337
aa(lp338
VHere's another story.
p339
aVAt 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001,
p340
aVthere were tens of thousands of people
p341
aVin the vicinity of the World Trade Center
p342
aVin New York \u2014
p343
aVcommuters spilling off trains,
p344
aVwaitresses setting tables for the morning rush,
p345
aVbrokers already working the phones on Wall Street.
p346
aV1,700 of these people were pregnant women.
p347
aVWhen the planes struck and the towers collapsed,
p348
aVmany of these women experienced the same horrors
p349
aVinflicted on other survivors of the disaster \u2014
p350
aVthe overwhelming chaos and confusion,
p351
aVthe rolling clouds
p352
aVof potentially toxic dust and debris,
p353
aVthe heart-pounding fear for their lives.
p354
aa(lp355
VAbout a year after 9/11,
p356
aVresearchers examined a group of women
p357
aVwho were pregnant
p358
aVwhen they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.
p359
aVIn the babies of those women
p360
aVwho developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD,
p361
aVfollowing their ordeal,
p362
aVresearchers discovered a biological marker
p363
aVof susceptibility to PTSD \u2014
p364
aVan effect that was most pronounced
p365
aVin infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe
p366
aVin their third trimester.
p367
aVIn other words,
p368
aVthe mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome
p369
aVhad passed on a vulnerability to the condition
p370
aVto their children while they were still in utero.
p371
aa(lp372
VNow consider this:
p373
aVpost-traumatic stress syndrome
p374
aVappears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong,
p375
aVcausing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.
p376
aVBut there's another way of thinking about PTSD.
p377
aVWhat looks like pathology to us
p378
aVmay actually be a useful adaptation
p379
aVin some circumstances.
p380
aVIn a particularly dangerous environment,
p381
aVthe characteristic manifestations of PTSD \u2014
p382
aVa hyper-awareness of one's surroundings,
p383
aVa quick-trigger response to danger \u2014
p384
aVcould save someone's life.
p385
aVThe notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive
p386
aVis still speculative,
p387
aVbut I find it rather poignant.
p388
aVIt would mean that, even before birth,
p389
aVmothers are warning their children
p390
aVthat it's a wild world out there,
p391
aVtelling them, "Be careful."
p392
aa(lp393
VLet me be clear.
p394
aVFetal origins research is not about blaming women
p395
aVfor what happens during pregnancy.
p396
aVIt's about discovering how best to promote
p397
aVthe health and well-being of the next generation.
p398
aVThat important effort must include a focus
p399
aVon what fetuses learn
p400
aVduring the nine months they spend in the womb.
p401
aVLearning is one of life's most essential activities,
p402
aVand it begins much earlier
p403
aVthan we ever imagined.
p404
aa(lp405
VThank you.

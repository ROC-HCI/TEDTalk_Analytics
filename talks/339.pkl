VWell, good morning.
p5
aVYou know, the computer and television both recently turned 60,
p6
aVand today I'd like to talk about their relationship.
p7
aVDespite their middle age, if you've been following the themes
p8
aVof this conference or the entertainment industry,
p9
aVit's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other.
p10
aVSo it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television,
p11
aVor why the invention of the atomic bomb
p12
aVunleashed forces that lead to the writers' strike.
p13
aVAnd it's not just what these are doing to each other,
p14
aVbut it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter.
p15
aa(lp16
VTo get a sense of this,
p17
aVand it's been a theme we've talked about all week,
p18
aVI recently talked to a bunch of tweeners.
p19
aVI wrote on cards: "television," "radio," "MySpace," "Internet," "PC."
p20
aVAnd I said, just arrange these, from what's important to you
p21
aVand what's not, and then tell me why.
p22
aVLet's listen to what happens when they get to the portion
p23
aVof the discussion on television.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Video) Girl 1: Well, I think it's important but, like, not necessary
p26
aVbecause you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs.
p27
aa(lp28
VPeter Hirshberg: Which is more fun, Internet or TV?
p29
aa(lp30
VGirls: Internet.
p31
aVGirl 2: I think we \u2014 the reasons, one of the reasons we put computer before TV
p32
aVis because nowadays, like, we have TV shows on the computer.
p33
aV(Girl 3: Oh, yeah.)
p34
aVGirl 2: And then you can download onto your iPod.
p35
aa(lp36
VPH: Would you like to be the president of a TV network?
p37
aa(lp38
VGirl 4: I wouldn't like it.
p39
aVGirl 2: That would be so stressful.
p40
aVGirl 5: No.
p41
aa(lp42
VPH: How come?
p43
aa(lp44
VGirl 5: Because they're going to lose all their money eventually.
p45
aVGirl 3: Like the stock market, it goes up and down and stuff.
p46
aVI think right now the computers will be at the top
p47
aVand everything will be kind of going down and stuff.
p48
aa(lp49
VPH: There's been an uneasy relationship between the TV business
p50
aVand the tech business, really ever since they both turned about 30.
p51
aVWe go through periods of enthrallment,
p52
aVfollowed by reactions in boardrooms, in the finance community
p53
aVbest characterized as, what's the finance term? Ick pooey.
p54
aa(lp55
VLet me give you an example of this. The year is 1976,
p56
aVand Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise.
p57
aVThe next year they march forward and they introduce Qube,
p58
aVthe first interactive cable TV system,
p59
aVand the New York Times heralds this
p60
aVas telecommunications moving to the home,
p61
aVconvergence, great things are happening.
p62
aVEverybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures \u2014
p63
aVCiticorp, Penney, RCA \u2014 all getting into this big vision.
p64
aVBy the way, this is about when I enter the picture.
p65
aVI'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner.
p66
aVThat summer I'm all \u2014 I'm at Warner that summer \u2014
p67
aVI'm all excited to work on convergence, and then the bottom falls out.
p68
aVDoesn't work out too well for them, they lose money.
p69
aVAnd I had a happy brush with convergence
p70
aVuntil, kind of, Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing.
p71
aa(lp72
VThat's when I leave graduate school, and I can't work in New York
p73
aVon kind of entertainment and technology
p74
aVbecause I have to be exiled to California, where the remaining jobs are,
p75
aValmost to the sea, to go to work for Apple Computer.
p76
aVWarner, of course, writes off more than 400 million dollars.
p77
aVFour hundred million dollars, which was real money back in the '70s.
p78
aVBut they were onto something and they got better at it.
p79
aVBy the year 2000, the process was perfected. They merged with AOL,
p80
aVand in just four years, managed to shed about 200 billion dollars
p81
aVof market capitalization, showing that they'd actually mastered the art
p82
aVof applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization
p83
aVto their balance sheet.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities,
p88
aVor the media community, is driven so crazy by the tech community
p89
aVis that tech folks talk differently.
p90
aVYou know, for 50 years, we've talked about changing the world,
p91
aVabout total transformation.
p92
aVFor 50 years, it's been about hopes and fears
p93
aVand promises of a better world. And I got to thinking,
p94
aVyou know, who else talks that way?
p95
aVAnd the answer is pretty clearly \u2014
p96
aVit's people in religion and in politics.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd so I realized that actually the tech world is best understood,
p99
aVnot as a business cycle, but as a messianic movement.
p100
aVWe promise something great, we evangelize it,
p101
aVwe're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well,
p102
aVand so we actually go back to the well and start all over again,
p103
aVas the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute, morbid astonishment.
p104
aVBut it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo, what I'd like to ask is, if the computer is becoming a principal tool
p107
aVof media and entertainment, how did we get here?
p108
aVI mean, how did a machine that was built for accounting
p109
aVand artillery morph into media?
p110
aa(lp111
VOf course, the first computer was built just after World War II
p112
aVto solve military problems, but things got really interesting
p113
aVjust a couple of years later \u2014 1949 with Whirlwind,
p114
aVbuilt at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy,
p115
aVbut you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind
p116
aVa machine that might actually be a potential media star.
p117
aVSo take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist
p118
aVof early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers,
p119
aVand the computer begins to express itself.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Video) Journalist: It's a Whirlwind electronic computer.
p122
aVWith considerable trepidation,
p123
aVwe undertake to interview this new machine.
p124
aa(lp125
VJay Forrester: Hello New York, this is Cambridge.
p126
aVAnd this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer.
p127
aVWould you like if I used the machine?
p128
aa(lp129
VJournalist: Yes, of course. But I have an idea, Mr. Forrester.
p130
aVSince this computer was made
p131
aVin conjunction with the Office of Naval Research,
p132
aVwhy don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington
p133
aVand let the Navy's research chief, Admiral Bolster,
p134
aVgive Whirlwind the workout?
p135
aa(lp136
VCalvin Bolster: Well, Ed, this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket.
p137
aVThis rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky.
p138
aVNow, at the standard rate of fuel consumption,
p139
aVI would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket
p140
aVand see how it can determine, at any instant,
p141
aVsay at the end of 40 seconds, the amount of fuel remaining,
p142
aVand the velocity at that set instant.
p143
aVJF: Over on the left-hand side,
p144
aVyou will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off.
p145
aVAnd on the right-hand side, there's a scale
p146
aVthat shows the rocket's velocity.
p147
aVThe rocket's position is shown by the trajectory
p148
aVthat we're now looking at.
p149
aVAnd as it reaches the peak of its trajectory,
p150
aVthe velocity, you will notice, has dropped off to a minimum.
p151
aVThen, as the rocket dives down, velocity picks up again
p152
aVtoward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground.
p153
aa(lp154
VHow's that?
p155
aVJournalist: What about that, Admiral?
p156
aVCB: Looks very good to me.
p157
aa(lp158
VJF: And before leaving, we would like to show you another kind of
p159
aVmathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out
p160
aVin their spare time, in a less serious vein, for a Sunday afternoon. (Music)
p161
aa(lp162
VJournalist: Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab.
p163
aa(lp164
VPH: You know, so much was worked out: the first real-time interaction,
p165
aVthe video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer,
p166
aVbut unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy,
p167
aVand all of this would have been lost
p168
aVif it weren't for a happy coincidence.
p169
aa(lp170
VEnter the atomic bomb.
p171
aVWe're threatened by the greatest weapon ever,
p172
aVand knowing a good thing when it sees it,
p173
aVthe Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us.
p174
aVThey adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system,
p175
aVdeploy it all across the frozen north,
p176
aVand spend nearly three times as much on this computer
p177
aVas was spent on the Manhattan Project
p178
aVbuilding the A-Bomb in the first place.
p179
aVTalk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry.
p180
aVAnd you can imagine that the Air Force became a pretty good salesman.
p181
aVHere's their marketing video.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Video) Narrator: In a mass raid, high-speed bombers could be in on us
p184
aVbefore we could determine their tracks.
p185
aVAnd then it would be too late to act.
p186
aVWe cannot afford to take that chance.
p187
aVIt is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE,
p188
aVthe Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system,
p189
aVto strengthen our air defenses.
p190
aVThis new computer, built to become the nerve center of a defense network,
p191
aVis able to perform all the complex mathematical problems
p192
aVinvolved in countering a mass enemy raid.
p193
aVIt is provided with its own powerhouse
p194
aVcontaining large diesel-driven generators,
p195
aVair-conditioning equipment, and cooling towers
p196
aVrequired to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer.
p197
aa(lp198
VPH: You know, that one computer was huge.
p199
aVThere's an interesting marketing lesson from it,
p200
aVwhich is basically, when you market a product,
p201
aVyou can either say, this is going to be wonderful,
p202
aVit will make you feel better and enliven you.
p203
aVOr there's one other marketing proposition: if you don't use our product, you'll die.
p204
aVThis is a really good example of that.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis had the first pointing device. It was distributed,
p207
aVso it worked out \u2014 distributed computing and modems \u2014
p208
aVso all these things could talk to each other.
p209
aVAbout 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing,
p210
aVand it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.
p211
aVYou saw how huge it was, and to give you a sense for this \u2014
p212
aVbecause we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small
p213
aVat this conference, so let's talk about making things large.
p214
aVIf we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know,
p215
aVsay, Century City, it would fit beautifully.
p216
aVYou'd kind of have to take Century City out, but it could fit in there.
p217
aa(lp218
VBut like, let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor,
p219
aVthe latest Core 2 Extreme, which is a four-core processor
p220
aVthat Intel's working on, it will be our laptop tomorrow.
p221
aVTo build that, what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is
p222
aVwe'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland,
p223
aVand from the 405 to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds.
p224
aVAnd then, the 92 nuclear power plants
p225
aVthat it would take to provide the power
p226
aVwould fill up the rest of Los Angeles.
p227
aVThat's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates.
p228
aVSo, the next time they tell you they're on to something, clearly they're not.
p229
aVSo \u2014 and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs.
p230
aVBut it gives you the kind of power that people have, that the audience has,
p231
aVand the reasons these transformations are happening.
p232
aa(lp233
VAll of this stuff starts moving into industry.
p234
aVDEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer.
p235
aVIt shows up at places like MIT, and then a mutation happens.
p236
aVSpacewar! is built, the first computer game, and all of a sudden,
p237
aVinteractivity and involvement and passion is worked out.
p238
aVActually, many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing,
p239
aVand many of the principles of gaming today were worked out.
p240
aVDEC knew a good thing about wasting time.
p241
aVIt shipped every one of its computers with that game.
p242
aa(lp243
VMeanwhile, as all of this is happening, by the mid-'50s,
p244
aVthe business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema
p245
aVhas been busted completely.
p246
aVA new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls
p247
aVand they're quite certain that television is about to do them in.
p248
aVIn fact, despair is in the air.
p249
aVAnd a quote that sounds largely reminiscent
p250
aVfrom everything I've been reading all week.
p251
aVRCA had David Sarnoff, who basically commercialized radio,
p252
aVsaid this, "I don't say that radio networks must die.
p253
aVEvery effort has been made and will continue to be made
p254
aVto find a new pattern, new selling arrangements
p255
aVand new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues.
p256
aVIt may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio,
p257
aVbut I don't know how."
p258
aVAnd of course, as the computer industry develops interactively,
p259
aVproducers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea.
p260
aVAnd they fake it.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Video) Jack Berry: Boys and girls, I think you all know how to get your magic windows
p263
aVup on the set, you just get them out.
p264
aVFirst of all, get your Winky Dink kits out.
p265
aVPut out your Magic Window and your erasing glove, and rub it like this.
p266
aVThat's the way we get some of the magic into it, boys and girls.
p267
aVThen take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set,
p268
aVand rub it out from the center to the corners, like this.
p269
aVMake sure you keep your magic crayons handy, your Winky Dink crayons
p270
aVand your erasing glove,
p271
aVbecause you'll be using them during the show to draw like that.
p272
aVYou all set? OK, let's get right to the first story about Dusty Man.
p273
aVCome on into the secret lab.
p274
aa(lp275
VPH: It was the dawn of interactive TV, and you may have noticed
p276
aVthey wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits.
p277
aVThose are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you're saying.
p278
aV"Pete, I could use any ordinary open-source crayon,
p279
aVwhy do I have to buy theirs?"
p280
aVI assure you, that's not the case.
p281
aVTurns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons
p282
aVyou should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window,
p283
aVother crayons may discolor or hurt the window.
p284
aVThis proprietary principle of vendor lock-in
p285
aVwould go on to be perfected with great success
p286
aVas one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere.
p287
aVIt led to lawsuits \u2014
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter) \u2014
p290
aa(lp291
Vfederal investigations, and lots of repercussions,
p292
aVand that's a scandal we won't discuss today.
p293
aa(lp294
VBut we will discuss this scandal, because this man, Jack Berry, the host of "Winky Dink,"
p295
aVwent on to become the host of "Twenty One," one of the most important quiz shows ever.
p296
aVAnd it was rigged, and it became unraveled when this man,
p297
aVCharles van Doren, was outed after an unnatural winning streak,
p298
aVending Berry's career.
p299
aVAnd actually, ending the career of a lot of people at CBS.
p300
aVIt turns out there was a lot to learn
p301
aVabout how this new medium worked.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd 50 years ago, if you'd been at a meeting like this
p304
aVand were trying to understand the media,
p305
aVthere was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from,
p306
aVProfessor Marshall McLuhan.
p307
aVHe actually understood something about a theme
p308
aVthat we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audience
p309
aVin an era of pervasive electronic communications.
p310
aVHere he is talking from the 1960s.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Video) Marshall McLuhan: If the audience can become involved in the actual process
p313
aVof making the ad, then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows.
p314
aVThey were great TV because it gave the audience a role, something to do.
p315
aVThey were horrified when they discovered
p316
aVthey'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged.
p317
aVNow, then, this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV
p318
aVon the part of the programmers.
p319
aa(lp320
VPH: You know, McLuhan talked about the global village.
p321
aVIf you substitute the word blogosphere, of the Internet today,
p322
aVit is very true that his understanding is probably
p323
aVvery enlightening now. Let's listen in to him.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Video) MM: The global village is a world
p326
aVin which you don't necessarily have harmony.
p327
aVYou have extreme concern with everybody else's business
p328
aVand much involvement in everybody else's life.
p329
aVIt's a sort of Ann Landers' column writ large.
p330
aVAnd it doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet,
p331
aVbut it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs.
p332
aVAnd so the global village is as big as a planet,
p333
aVand as small as a village post office.
p334
aa(lp335
VPH: We'll talk a little bit more about him later.
p336
aVWe're now right into the 1960s.
p337
aVIt's the era of big business and data centers for computing.
p338
aVBut all that was about to change.
p339
aVYou know, the expression of technology
p340
aVreflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in.
p341
aVAnd when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations,
p342
aVit's not just a joke about messianism, it's actually what we do.
p343
aVBut for this part of the story, I'd actually like to throw it
p344
aVto America's leading technology correspondent, John Markoff.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Video) John Markoff: Do you want to know what the counterculture
p347
aVin drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll and the anti-war movement
p348
aVhad to do with computing? Everything.
p349
aVIt all happened within five miles of where I'm standing,
p350
aVat Stanford University, between 1960 and 1975.
p351
aVIn the midst of revolution in the streets
p352
aVand rock and roll concerts in the parks,
p353
aVa group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy,
p354
aVa computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab,
p355
aVand Doug Engelbart, a computer scientist at SRI, changed the world.
p356
aVEngelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture,
p357
aVbut while he was beginning to do his work,
p358
aVall of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula.
p359
aVThere was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experiments
p360
aVand other areas around the campus,
p361
aVand there was music literally in the streets.
p362
aVThe Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors.
p363
aVPeople were leaving to go back to the land.
p364
aVThere was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation.
p365
aVThere was women's liberation.
p366
aVThis was a remarkable place, at a remarkable time.
p367
aVAnd into that ferment came the microprocessor.
p368
aa(lp369
VI think it was that interaction that led to personal computing.
p370
aVThey saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment
p371
aVas ones that could actually be liberated and put to use
p372
aVby these communities that they were trying to build.
p373
aVAnd most importantly, they had this ethos of sharing information.
p374
aVI think these ideas are difficult to understand,
p375
aVbecause when you're trapped in one paradigm,
p376
aVthe next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe \u2014 it makes no sense.
p377
aVThe stories were so compelling that I decided to write a book about them.
p378
aVThe title of the book is, "What the Dormouse Said:
p379
aVHow the '60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry."
p380
aVThe title was taken from the lyrics
p381
aVto a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go,
p382
aV"Remember what the dormouse said.
p383
aVFeed your head, feed your head, feed your head." (Music)
p384
aa(lp385
VPH: By this time, computing had kind of leapt into media territory,
p386
aVand in short order much of what we're doing today was imagined
p387
aVin Cambridge and Silicon Valley.
p388
aVHere's the Architecture Machine Group,
p389
aVthe predecessor of the Media Lab, in 1981.
p390
aVMeanwhile, in California, we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff.
p391
aVHyperCard was the first program
p392
aVto introduce the public to hyperlinks,
p393
aVwhere you could randomly hook to any kind of picture,
p394
aVor piece of text, or data across a file system,
p395
aVand we had no way of explaining it.
p396
aVThere was no metaphor. Was it a database?
p397
aVA prototyping tool? A scripted language?
p398
aVHeck, it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure.
p399
aa(lp400
VWe asked a question about how the mind works,
p401
aVand we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant.
p402
aVA few years later, we then hit on the idea
p403
aVof explaining to people the secret of, how do you get the content you want,
p404
aVthe way you want it and the easy way?
p405
aVHere's the Apple marketing video.
p406
aa(lp407
V(Video) James Burke: You'll be pleased to know, I'm sure, that there are several ways
p408
aVto create a HyperCard interactive video.
p409
aVThe most involved method is to go ahead
p410
aVand produce your own videodisc
p411
aVas well as build your own HyperCard stacks.
p412
aVBy far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodisc
p413
aVand HyperCard stacks from a commercial supplier.
p414
aVThe method we illustrate in this video
p415
aVuses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks.
p416
aVThis method allows you to use existing videodisc materials
p417
aVin ways which suit your specific needs and interests.
p418
aa(lp419
VPH: I hope you realize how subversive that is.
p420
aVThat's like a Dick Cheney speech.
p421
aVYou think he's a nice balding guy, but he's just declared war
p422
aVon the content business. Find the commercial stuff,
p423
aVmash it up, tell the story your way.
p424
aVNow, as long as we confine this to the education market,
p425
aVand a personal matter between the computer and the file system,
p426
aVthat's fine, but as you can see, it was about to leap out and upset Jack Valenti
p427
aVand a lot of other people.
p428
aa(lp429
VBy the way, speaking of the filing system, it never occurred to us
p430
aVthat these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network.
p431
aVA few years later, Tim Berners-Lee worked that out.
p432
aVIt became a killer app of links, and today, of course,
p433
aVwe call that the World Wide Web.
p434
aVNow, not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet,
p435
aVbut a couple of years later, I helped Bill Gates do the same thing.
p436
aVThe year is 1993
p437
aVand he was working on a book and I was working on a video
p438
aVto help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this.
p439
aVWe were plenty aware that we were messing with media,
p440
aVand on the surface, it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things,
p441
aVbut we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look.
p442
aa(lp443
V(Video) Narrator: The pyramids, the Colosseum, the New York subway system
p444
aVand TV dinners, ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all.
p445
aVYet each pales to insignificance with the completion
p446
aVof that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology,
p447
aVthe Digital Superhighway.
p448
aVOnce it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians.
p449
aVThe Digital Highway arrived in America's living rooms late in the twentieth century.
p450
aVLet us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible.
p451
aVThe Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail
p452
aVfirst blazed by Alexander Graham Bell.
p453
aVThough some were incredulous ... Man 1: The phone company!
p454
aVNarrator: Stirred by the prospects of mass communication
p455
aVand making big bucks on advertising,
p456
aVDavid Sarnoff commercializes radio.
p457
aVMan 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.
p458
aVNarrator: The medium introduced America to new products.
p459
aVVoice 1: Say, mom, Windows for Radio means more enjoyment
p460
aVand greater ease of use for the whole family.
p461
aVBe sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work.
p462
aVNarrator: In 1939, the Radio Corporation of America introduced television.
p463
aVMan 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.
p464
aa(lp465
VNarrator: Eventually, the race to the future took on added momentum
p466
aVwith the breakup of the telephone company.
p467
aVAnd further stimulus came
p468
aVwith the deregulation of the cable television industry,
p469
aVand the re-regulation of the cable television industry.
p470
aVTed Turner: We did the work to build this, this cable industry,
p471
aVnow the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean, it's ridiculous.
p472
aVNarrator: Computers, once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks,
p473
aVescaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas.
p474
aVThe world and all its culture reduced to bits,
p475
aVthe lingua franca of all media.
p476
aVAnd the forces of convergence exploded.
p477
aa(lp478
VFinally, four great industrial sectors combined.
p479
aVTelecommunications, entertainment, computing and everything else.
p480
aVMan 3: We'll see channels for the gourmet
p481
aVand we'll see channels for the pet lover.
p482
aVVoice 2: Next on the gourmet pet channel,
p483
aVdecorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer.
p484
aVNarrator: All of industry was in play, as investors flocked to place their bets.
p485
aVAt stake: the battle for you, the consumer,
p486
aVand the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America. (Music)
p487
aa(lp488
VPH: We missed a lot. You know, you missed, we missed the Internet,
p489
aVthe long tail, the role of the audience, open systems, social networks.
p490
aVIt just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media.
p491
aVThomas Edison had the same problem.
p492
aVHe wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it,
p493
aVand kind of only one of his ideas
p494
aVturned out to have been the right early idea.
p495
aVWell, you know where we're going on from here.
p496
aVWe come into the era of the dotcom, the World Wide Web,
p497
aVand I don't need to tell you about that
p498
aVbecause we all went through that bubble together.
p499
aVBut when we emerge from this and what we call Web 2.0,
p500
aVthings actually are quite different.
p501
aVAnd I think it's the reason that TV's so challenged.
p502
aVIf Internet one was about pages, now it's about people.
p503
aVIt's a customer, it's an audience, it's a person who's participating.
p504
aVIt's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now.
p505
aa(lp506
V(Video) MM: Because it gave the audience a role, something to do.
p507
aa(lp508
VPH: In my own company, Technorati,
p509
aVwe see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in.
p510
aVThat's about 2,700 fresh, connective links
p511
aVacross about 112 million blogs that are out there.
p512
aVAnd it's no wonder that as we head into the writers' strike, odd things happen.
p513
aVYou know, it reminds me of that old saw in Hollywood,
p514
aVthat a producer is anyone who knows a writer.
p515
aVI now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem.
p516
aVBut it's not a joke. This is a real headline.
p517
aV"Websites attract striking writers:
p518
aVoperators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com
p519
aVcould benefit from labor disputes."
p520
aVMeanwhile, you have the TV bloggers going out on strike,
p521
aVin sympathy with the television writers.
p522
aVAnd then you have TV Guide, a Fox property,
p523
aVwhich is about to sponsor the online video awards \u2014
p524
aVbut cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television,
p525
aVnot appearing to gloat.
p526
aVTo show you how schizophrenic this all is,
p527
aVhere's the head of MySpace, or Fox Interactive, a News Corp company,
p528
aVbeing asked, well, with the writers' strike,
p529
aVisn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online?
p530
aa(lp531
V(Video) Man: But I, yeah, I think there's an opportunity. As the strike continues,
p532
aVthere's an opportunity for more people to experience
p533
aVvideo on places like MySpace TV.
p534
aa(lp535
VPH: Oh, but then he remembers he works for Rupert Murdoch.
p536
aa(lp537
V(Video) Man: Yes, well, first, you know, I'm part of News Corporation
p538
aVas part of Fox Entertainment Group.
p539
aVObviously, we hope that the strike is \u2014
p540
aVthat the issues are resolved as quickly as possible.
p541
aa(lp542
VPH: One of the great things that's going on here is
p543
aVthe globalization of content really is happening.
p544
aVHere is a clip from a video, from a piece of animation
p545
aVthat was written by a writer in Hollywood,
p546
aVanimation worked out in Israel, farmed out to Croatia and India,
p547
aVand it's now an international series.
p548
aa(lp549
V(Video) Narrator: The following takes place between the minutes of 2:15 p.m. and 2:18 p.m.,
p550
aVin the months preceding the presidential primaries.
p551
aa(lp552
VVoice 1: You'll have to stay here in the safe house
p553
aVuntil we get word the terrorist threat is over.
p554
aa(lp555
VVoice 2: You mean we'll have to live here, together?
p556
aVVoices 2, 3 and 4: With her?
p557
aVVoice 2: Well, there goes the neighborhood.
p558
aa(lp559
VPH: The company that created this, Aniboom, is an interesting example
p560
aVof where this is headed. Traditional TV animation costs, say,
p561
aVbetween 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute.
p562
aVThey're producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute.
p563
aVAnd they're offering their creators 30 percent of the back end,
p564
aVin a much more entrepreneurial manner. So, it's a different model.
p565
aVWhat the entertainment business is struggling with,
p566
aVthe world of brands is figuring out.
p567
aa(lp568
VFor example, Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe,
p569
aVit's a network to hook its customers together.
p570
aVAnd the head of marketing at Nike says, "People are coming to our site
p571
aVan average of three times a week. We don't have to go to them."
p572
aVWhich means television advertising is down 57 percent for Nike.
p573
aVOr, as Nike's head of marketing says,
p574
aV"We're not in the business of keeping media companies alive.
p575
aVWe're in the business of connecting with consumers."
p576
aa(lp577
VAnd media companies realize the audience is important also.
p578
aVHere's a man announcing the new Market Watch from Dow Jones,
p579
aVpowered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page \u2014
p580
aVuser-generated content married up with traditional content.
p581
aVIt turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them.
p582
aVOr, as Geoffrey Moore once told me,
p583
aVit's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need
p584
aVin the age of the blogosphere.
p585
aVAnd I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business.
p586
aa(lp587
VOne of my heroes is songwriter, Ally Willis,
p588
aVwho just wrote "The Color Purple" and has been an R and \u2014
p589
aVrhythm and blues writer, and this is what she said
p590
aVabout where songwriting's going.
p591
aa(lp592
VAlly Willis: Where millions of collaborators wanted the song,
p593
aVbecause to look at them strictly as spam
p594
aVis missing what this medium is about.
p595
aa(lp596
VPH: So, to wrap up, I'd love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan,
p597
aVwho, 40 years ago, was dealing with audiences
p598
aVthat were going through just as much change,
p599
aVand I think that, today, traditional Hollywood and the writers
p600
aVare framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before.
p601
aVBut I don't need to tell you this, let's throw it back to him.
p602
aa(lp603
V(Video) Narrator: We are in the middle of a tremendous clash between the old and the new.
p604
aVMM: The medium does things to people
p605
aVand they are always completely unaware of this.
p606
aVThey don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up.
p607
aVThey think of the old medium,
p608
aVbecause the old medium is always the content of the new medium,
p609
aVas movies tend to be the content of TV,
p610
aVand as books used to be the content,
p611
aVnovels used to be the content of movies.
p612
aVAnd so every time a new medium arrives,
p613
aVthe old medium is the content, and it is highly observable,
p614
aVhighly noticeable, but the real, real roughing up and massaging
p615
aVis done by the new medium, and it is ignored.
p616
aa(lp617
VPH: I think it's a great time of enthrallment.
p618
aVThere's been more raw DNA of communications and media
p619
aVthrown out there. Content is moving from shows to particles
p620
aVthat are batted back and forth, and part of social communications,
p621
aVand I think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity.
p622
aVAnd whereas television may have gotten beat up,
p623
aVwhat's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication,
p624
aVand we kind of have the merger of the two industries
p625
aVand a new way of thinking to look at it.
p626
aa(lp627
VThanks very much.

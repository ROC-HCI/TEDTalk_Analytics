VA herd of wildebeests, a shoal of fish,
p5
aVa flock of birds.
p6
aVMany animals gather in large groups
p7
aVthat are among the most wonderful spectacles
p8
aVin the natural world.
p9
aVBut why do these groups form?
p10
aVThe common answers include things like
p11
aVseeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs
p12
aVor gathering to mate or breed,
p13
aVand all of these explanations,
p14
aVwhile often true,
p15
aVmake a huge assumption about animal behavior,
p16
aVthat the animals are in control of their own actions,
p17
aVthat they are in charge of their bodies.
p18
aVAnd that is often not the case.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis is Artemia, a brine shrimp.
p21
aVYou probably know it better as a sea monkey.
p22
aVIt's small, and it typically lives alone,
p23
aVbut it can gather in these large red swarms
p24
aVthat span for meters,
p25
aVand these form because of a parasite.
p26
aVThese shrimp are infected with a tapeworm.
p27
aVA tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut
p28
aVwith genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other.
p29
aVAs a freelance journalist, I sympathize.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVThe tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body,
p32
aVbut it also does other things.
p33
aVIt castrates them,
p34
aVit changes their color from transparent to bright red,
p35
aVit makes them live longer,
p36
aVand as biologist Nicolas Rode has found,
p37
aVit makes them swim in groups.
p38
aVWhy? Because the tapeworm, like many other parasites,
p39
aVhas a complicated life cycle
p40
aVinvolving many different hosts.
p41
aVThe shrimp are just one step on its journey.
p42
aVIts ultimate destination is this,
p43
aVthe greater flamingo.
p44
aVOnly in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce,
p45
aVso to get there, it manipulates its shrimp hosts
p46
aVinto forming these conspicuous colored swarms
p47
aVthat are easier for a flamingo to spot
p48
aVand to devour,
p49
aVand that is the secret of the Artemia swarm.
p50
aVThey aren't sociable through their own volition,
p51
aVbut because they are being controlled.
p52
aVIt's not safety in numbers.
p53
aVIt's actually the exact opposite.
p54
aVThe tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies,
p55
aVturning them into vehicles
p56
aVfor getting itself into a flamingo.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd here is another example
p59
aVof a parasitic manipulation.
p60
aVThis is a suicidal cricket.
p61
aVThis cricket swallowed the  larvae of a Gordian worm,
p62
aVor horsehair worm.
p63
aVThe worm grew to adult size within it,
p64
aVbut it needs to get into water in order to mate,
p65
aVand it does that by releasing proteins
p66
aVthat addle the cricket's brain,
p67
aVcausing it to behave erratically.
p68
aVWhen the cricket nears a body of water,
p69
aVsuch as this swimming pool,
p70
aVit jumps in and drowns,
p71
aVand the worm wriggles out
p72
aVof its suicidal corpse.
p73
aVCrickets are really roomy. Who knew?
p74
aa(lp75
VThe tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone.
p76
aVThey are part of an entire cavalcade
p77
aVof mind-controlling parasites,
p78
aVof fungi, viruses, and worms and insects and more
p79
aVthat all specialize in subverting and overriding
p80
aVthe wills of their hosts.
p81
aVNow, I first learned about this way of life
p82
aVthrough David Attenborough's "Trials of Life"
p83
aVabout 20 years ago,
p84
aVand then later through a wonderful book called
p85
aV"Parasite Rex" by my friend Carl Zimmer.
p86
aVAnd I've been writing about these creatures ever since.
p87
aVFew topics in biology enthrall me more.
p88
aVIt's like the parasites have subverted my own brain.
p89
aVBecause after all, they are always compelling
p90
aVand they are delightfully macabre.
p91
aVWhen you write about parasites,
p92
aVyour lexicon swells with phrases like
p93
aV"devoured alive" and "bursts out of its body."
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VBut there's more to it than that.
p97
aVI'm a writer, and fellow writers in the audience
p98
aVwill know that we love stories.
p99
aVParasites invite us to resist the allure
p100
aVof obvious stories.
p101
aVTheir world is one of plot twists
p102
aVand unexpected explanations.
p103
aVWhy, for example,
p104
aVdoes this caterpillar
p105
aVstart violently thrashing about
p106
aVwhen another insect gets close to it
p107
aVand those white cocoons that it seems
p108
aVto be standing guard over?
p109
aVIs it maybe protecting its siblings?
p110
aVNo.
p111
aVThis caterpillar was attacked
p112
aVby a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it.
p113
aVThe eggs hatched and the young wasps
p114
aVdevoured the caterpillar alive
p115
aVbefore bursting out of its body.
p116
aVSee what I mean?
p117
aVNow, the caterpillar didn't die.
p118
aVSome of the wasps seemed to stay behind
p119
aVand controlled it into defending their siblings
p120
aVwhich are metamorphosing
p121
aVinto adults within those cocoons.
p122
aVThis caterpillar is a head-banging  zombie bodyguard
p123
aVdefending the offspring
p124
aVof the creature that killed it.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VWe have a lot to get through.  I only have 13 minutes. (Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, some of you are probably just
p131
aVdesperately clawing for some solace
p132
aVin the idea that these things are oddities
p133
aVof the natural world, that they are outliers,
p134
aVand that point of view is understandable,
p135
aVbecause by their nature, parasites are quite small
p136
aVand they spend a lot of their time
p137
aVinside the bodies of other things.
p138
aVThey're easy to overlook,
p139
aVbut that doesn't mean that they aren't important.
p140
aVA few years back, a man called Kevin Lafferty
p141
aVtook a group of scientists into three Californian estuaries
p142
aVand they pretty much weighed and dissected
p143
aVand recorded everything they could find,
p144
aVand what they found
p145
aVwere parasites in extreme abundance.
p146
aVEspecially common were trematodes,
p147
aVtiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts
p148
aVlike this unfortunate snail.
p149
aVNow, a single trematode is tiny, microscopic,
p150
aVbut collectively they weighed as much
p151
aVas all the fish in the estuaries
p152
aVand three to nine times more than all the birds.
p153
aVAnd remember the Gordian worm that I showed you,
p154
aVthe cricket thing?
p155
aVOne Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato
p156
aVfound that in one stream,
p157
aVthese things drive so many crickets
p158
aVand grasshoppers into the water
p159
aVthat the drowned insects
p160
aVmake up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout.
p161
aVManipulation is not an oddity.
p162
aVIt is a critical and common part
p163
aVof the world around us,
p164
aVand scientists have now found
p165
aVhundreds of examples of such manipulators,
p166
aVand more excitingly, they're starting to understand
p167
aVexactly how these creatures control their hosts.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd this is one of my favorite examples.
p170
aVThis is Ampulex compressa,
p171
aVthe emerald cockroach wasp,
p172
aVand it is a truth universally acknowledged
p173
aVthat an emerald cockroach wasp in possession
p174
aVof some fertilized eggs
p175
aVmust be in want of a cockroach.
p176
aVWhen she finds one,
p177
aVshe stabs it with a stinger
p178
aVthat is also a sense organ.
p179
aVThis discovery came out three weeks ago.
p180
aVShe stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ
p181
aVequipped with small sensory bumps
p182
aVthat allow her to feel the distinctive texture
p183
aVof a roach's brain.
p184
aVSo like a person blindly rooting about in a bag,
p185
aVshe finds the brain, and she injects it with venom
p186
aVinto two very specific clusters of neurons.
p187
aVIsraeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal
p188
aVfound that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon.
p189
aVIt doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it.
p190
aVThe roach could walk away
p191
aVor fly or run if it chose to,
p192
aVbut it doesn't choose to,
p193
aVbecause the venom nixes its motivation to walk,
p194
aVand only that.
p195
aVThe wasp basically un-checks the escape-from-danger box
p196
aVin the roach's operating system,
p197
aVallowing her to lead her helpless victim
p198
aVback to her lair by its antennae
p199
aVlike a person walking a dog.
p200
aVAnd once there, she lays an egg on it,
p201
aVegg hatches, devoured alive, bursts out of body,
p202
aVyadda yadda yadda, you know the drill.
p203
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p204
aa(lp205
VNow I would argue that, once stung,
p206
aVthe cockroach isn't a roach anymore.
p207
aVIt's more of an extension of the wasp,
p208
aVjust like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm.
p209
aVThese hosts won't get to survive or reproduce.
p210
aVThey have as much control over their own fates
p211
aVas my car.
p212
aVOnce the parasites get in,
p213
aVthe hosts don't get a say.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow humans, of course,
p216
aVare no stranger to manipulation.
p217
aVWe take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains
p218
aVand to change our moods,
p219
aVand what are arguments or advertising or big ideas
p220
aVif not an attempt to influence someone else's mind?
p221
aVBut our attempts at doing this
p222
aVare crude and blundering compared
p223
aVto the fine-grained specificity of the parasites.
p224
aVDon Draper only wishes he was as elegant
p225
aVand precise as the emerald cockroach wasp.
p226
aVNow, I think this is part of what makes parasites
p227
aVso sinister and so compelling.
p228
aVWe place such a premium on our free will
p229
aVand our independence
p230
aVthat the prospect of losing those qualities
p231
aVto forces unseen
p232
aVinforms many of our deepest societal fears.
p233
aVOrwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals
p234
aVand mind-controlling supervillains \u2014
p235
aVthese are tropes that fill our darkest fiction,
p236
aVbut in nature, they happen all the time.
p237
aa(lp238
VWhich leads me to an obvious
p239
aVand disquieting question:
p240
aVAre there dark, sinister parasites
p241
aVthat are influencing our behavior
p242
aVwithout us knowing about it,
p243
aVbesides the NSA?
p244
aVIf there are any \u2014
p245
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p246
aVI've got a red dot on my forehead now, don't I?
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VIf there are any, this is a good candidate for them.
p250
aVThis is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short,
p251
aVbecause the terrifying creature
p252
aValways deserves a cute nickname.
p253
aVToxo infects mammals,
p254
aVa wide variety of mammals,
p255
aVbut it can only sexually reproduce in a cat.
p256
aVAnd scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that
p257
aVif Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse,
p258
aVit turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile.
p259
aVIf the infected rat smells the delightful odor
p260
aVof cat piss,
p261
aVit runs towards the source of the smell
p262
aVrather than the more sensible direction of away.
p263
aVThe cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex.
p264
aVIt's a classic tale of Eat, Prey, Love.
p265
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VYou're very charitable, generous people.
p268
aVHi, Elizabeth, I loved your talk.
p269
aa(lp270
VHow does the parasite control its host
p271
aVin this way?
p272
aVWe don't really know.
p273
aVWe know that Toxo releases an enzyme
p274
aVthat makes dopamine, a substance involved
p275
aVin reward and motivation.
p276
aVWe know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain,
p277
aVincluding those involved in sexual arousal.
p278
aVBut how those puzzle pieces fit together
p279
aVis not immediately clear.
p280
aVWhat is clear is that this thing
p281
aVis a single cell.
p282
aVThis has no nervous system.
p283
aVIt has no consciousness.
p284
aVIt doesn't even have a body.
p285
aVBut it's manipulating a mammal?
p286
aVWe are mammals.
p287
aVWe are more intelligent than a mere rat, to be sure,
p288
aVbut our brains have the same basic structure,
p289
aVthe same types of cells,
p290
aVthe same chemicals running through them,
p291
aVand the same parasites.
p292
aVEstimates vary a lot, but some figures suggest
p293
aVthat one in three people around the world
p294
aVhave Toxo in their brains.
p295
aVNow typically, this doesn't lead to any overt illness.
p296
aVThe parasite holds up in a dormant state
p297
aVfor a long period of time.
p298
aVBut there's some evidence that those people
p299
aVwho are carriers score slightly differently
p300
aVon personality questionnaires than other people,
p301
aVthat they have a slightly  higher risk of car accidents,
p302
aVand there's some evidence that people with schizophrenia
p303
aVare more likely to be infected.
p304
aVNow, I think this evidence is still inconclusive,
p305
aVand even among Toxo researchers,
p306
aVopinion is divided as to whether the parasite
p307
aVis truly influencing our behavior.
p308
aVBut given the widespread nature of such manipulations,
p309
aVit would be completely implausible
p310
aVfor humans to be the only species
p311
aVthat weren't similarly affected.
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd I think that this capacity to constantly
p314
aVsubvert our way of thinking about the world
p315
aVmakes parasites amazing.
p316
aVThey're constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways,
p317
aVand to ask if the behaviors we're seeing,
p318
aVwhether they're simple and obvious
p319
aVor baffling and puzzling,
p320
aVare not the results of individuals
p321
aVacting through their own accord
p322
aVbut because they are being bent
p323
aVto the control of something else.
p324
aVAnd while that idea may be disquieting,
p325
aVand while parasites' habits may be very grisly,
p326
aVI think that ability to surprise us
p327
aVmakes them as wonderful and as charismatic
p328
aVas any panda or butterfly or dolphin.
p329
aa(lp330
VAt the end of "On the Origin of Species,"
p331
aVCharles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life,
p332
aVand of endless forms most beautiful
p333
aVand most wonderful,
p334
aVand I like to think he could easily have been talking
p335
aVabout a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable
p336
aVor a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks.
p337
aa(lp338
VBut perhaps, that's just a parasite talking.
p339
aa(lp340
VThank you.

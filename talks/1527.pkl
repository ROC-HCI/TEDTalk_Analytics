VAs you might imagine, I'm absolutely passionate
p5
aVabout dance. I'm passionate about making it,
p6
aVabout watching it, about encouraging others
p7
aVto participate in it,
p8
aVand I'm also really passionate about creativity.
p9
aVCreativity for me is something that's absolutely critical,
p10
aVand I think it's something that you can teach.
p11
aVI think the technicities of creativity can be taught
p12
aVand shared, and I think you can find out things
p13
aVabout your own personal physical signature,
p14
aVyour own cognitive habits, and use that as
p15
aVa point of departure to misbehave beautifully.
p16
aa(lp17
VI was born in the 1970s, and John Travolta was big
p18
aVin those days: "Grease," "Saturday Night Fever,"
p19
aVand he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me
p20
aVto start dancing. My parents were very up for me going.
p21
aVThey absolutely encouraged me to take risks, to go,
p22
aVto try, to try. I had an opportunity, an access
p23
aVto a local dance studio, and I had an enlightened teacher
p24
aVwho allowed me to make up my own and invent
p25
aVmy own dances, so what she did was let me make up
p26
aVmy own ballroom and Latin American dances to teach
p27
aVto my peers.
p28
aVAnd that was the very first time that I found an opportunity
p29
aVto feel that I was able to express my own voice,
p30
aVand that's what's fueled me, then, to become a choreographer.
p31
aVI feel like I've got something to say and something to share.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd I guess what's interesting is, is that I am now obsessed
p34
aVwith the technology of the body.
p35
aVI think it's the most technologically literate thing that we have,
p36
aVand I'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way
p37
aVof communicating ideas through the body to audiences
p38
aVthat might move them, touch them,
p39
aVhelp them think differently about things.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo for me, choreography is very much a process
p42
aVof physical thinking. It's very much in mind,
p43
aVas well as in body, and it's a collaborative process.
p44
aVIt's something that I have to do with other people.
p45
aVYou know, it's a distributed cognitive process in a way.
p46
aVI work often with designers and visual artists,
p47
aVobviously dancers and other choreographers,
p48
aVbut also, more and more, with economists,
p49
aVanthropologists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists,
p50
aVpeople really who come from very different domains of
p51
aVexpertise, where they bring their intelligence to bear
p52
aVon a different kind of creative process.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhat I thought we would do today a little bit is
p55
aVexplore this idea of physical thinking,
p56
aVand we're all experts in physical thinking.
p57
aVYeah, you all have a body, right?
p58
aVAnd we all know what that body is like in the real world,
p59
aVso one of the aspects of physical thinking
p60
aVthat we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception,
p61
aVthe sense of my own body in the space in the real world.
p62
aVSo, we all understand what it feels like to know
p63
aVwhere the ends of your fingers are
p64
aVwhen you hold out your arms, yeah?
p65
aVYou absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup,
p66
aVor that cup moves and you have to renavigate it.
p67
aVSo we're experts in physical thinking already.
p68
aVWe just don't think about our bodies very much.
p69
aVWe only think about them when they go wrong, so, when
p70
aVthere's a broken arm, or when you have a heart attack,
p71
aVthen you become really very aware of your bodies.
p72
aVBut how is it that we can start to think about using
p73
aVchoreographic thinking, kinesthetic intelligence, to arm
p74
aVthe ways in which we think about things more generally?
p75
aa(lp76
VWhat I thought I'd do is, I'd make a TED premiere.
p77
aVI'm not sure if this is going to be good or not.
p78
aVI'll just be doing it.
p79
aVI thought what I'd do is, I'd use three versions
p80
aVof physical thinking to make something.
p81
aa(lp82
VI want to introduce you. This is Paolo. This is Catarina.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VThey have no idea what we're going to do.
p87
aVSo this is not the type of choreography where
p88
aVI already have in mind what I'm going to make,
p89
aVwhere I've fixed the routine in my head
p90
aVand I'm just going to teach it to them,
p91
aVand these so-called empty vessels are just going to learn it.
p92
aVThat's not the methodology at all that we work with.
p93
aVBut what's important about it is how it is that they're
p94
aVgrasping information, how they're taking information,
p95
aVhow they're using it, and how they're thinking with it.
p96
aa(lp97
VI'm going to start really, really simply.
p98
aVUsually, dance has a stimulus or stimuli, and I thought
p99
aVI'd take something simple, TED logo, we can all see it,
p100
aVit's quite easy to work with, and I'm going to do something
p101
aVvery simply, where you take one idea from a body,
p102
aVand it happens to be my body, and translate that
p103
aVinto somebody else's body,
p104
aVso it's a direct transfer, transformation of energy.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd I'm going to imagine this, you can do this too if you like,
p107
aVthat I'm going to just take the letter "T" and I'm going
p108
aVto imagine it in mind, and I'm going to place that outside in
p109
aVthe real world. So I absolutely see a letter "T" in front of me.
p110
aVYeah? It's absolutely there.
p111
aVI can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?
p112
aVIt has a kind of a grammar. I know what I'm going to do
p113
aVwith it, and I can start to describe it, so I can describe it
p114
aVvery simply. I can describe it in my arms, right?
p115
aVSo all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand.
p116
aVI can describe it, whoa, in my head, you know? Whoa.
p117
aVOkay. I can do also my shoulder. Yeah?
p118
aVIt gives me something to do, something to work towards.
p119
aVIf I were to take that letter "T" and flatten it down
p120
aVon the floor, here, maybe just off the floor,
p121
aVall of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee,
p122
aVyeah? Whoa. So If I put the knee and the arms together,
p123
aVI've got something physical, yeah? And I can start to build something.
p124
aVSo what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so
p125
aVis I'm going to take that concept, I'm going to make something,
p126
aVand the dancers behind me are going to interpret it,
p127
aVthey're going to snapshot it, they're going to take
p128
aVaspects of it, and it's almost like I'm offloading memory
p129
aVand they're holding onto memory? Yeah?
p130
aVAnd we'll see what we come up with.
p131
aVSo just have a little watch about how they're, how they're
p132
aVaccessing this and what they're doing,
p133
aVand I'm just going to take this letter "T," the letter "E,"
p134
aVand the letter "D," to make something. Okay. Here goes.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo I have to get myself in the zone. Right.
p137
aa(lp138
VIt's a bit of a cross of my arm.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo all I'm doing is exploring this space of "T"
p141
aVand flashing through it with some action.
p142
aVI'm not remembering what I'm doing.
p143
aVI'm just working on my task. My task is this "T."
p144
aVGoing to watch it from the side, whoa.
p145
aVStrike moment.
p146
aVThat's it.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo we're starting to build a phrase.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo what they're doing, let's see, something like that,
p151
aVso what they're doing is grasping aspects of that movement
p152
aVand they're generating it into a phrase.
p153
aVYou can see the speed is extremely quick, yeah?
p154
aVI'm not asking them to copy exactly.
p155
aVThey're using the information that they receive
p156
aVto generate the beginnings of a phrase.
p157
aVI can watch that and that can tell me something
p158
aVabout how it is that they're moving.
p159
aVYeah, they're super quick, right?
p160
aa(lp161
VSo I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it
p162
aVinto something that's physical.
p163
aVSome dancers, when they're watching action,
p164
aVtake the overall shape, the arc of the movement,
p165
aVthe kinetic sense of the movement,
p166
aVand use that for memory.
p167
aVSome work very much in specific detail.
p168
aVThey start with small little units and build it up.
p169
aVOkay, you've got something? One more thing.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo they're solving this problem for me,
p172
aVhaving a little \u2014
p173
aVThey're constructing that phrase.
p174
aVThey have something and they're going to hold on to it,
p175
aVyeah? One way of making.
p176
aVThat's going to be my beginning in this world premiere.
p177
aa(lp178
VOkay. From there I'm going to do a very different thing.
p179
aVSo basically I'm going to make a duet.
p180
aVI want you to think about them as architectural objects,
p181
aVso what they are, are just pure lines.
p182
aVThey're no longer people, just pure lines, and I'm going
p183
aVto work with them almost as objects to think with, yeah?
p184
aVSo what I'm thinking about is taking
p185
aVa few physical extensions from the body as I move, and
p186
aVI move them, and I do that by suggesting things to them:
p187
aVIf, then; if, then. Okay, so here we go.
p188
aa(lp189
VJust grab this arm.
p190
aVCan you place that down into the floor?
p191
aVYeah, down to the floor. Can you go underneath?
p192
aVYeah. Cat, can you put leg over that side? Yeah.
p193
aVCan you rotate?
p194
aVWhoom, just go back to the beginning.
p195
aVHere we go, ready? And ... bam, bake ... (clicks metronome)
p196
aVGreat. Okay, from there, you're both getting up.
p197
aVYou're both getting up. Here we go. Good, now? Them.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Applause)
p200
aa(lp201
VSo from there, from there, we're both getting up,
p202
aVwe're both getting up, going in this direction,
p203
aVgoing underneath. Whoa, whoa, underneath.
p204
aVWhoa, underneath, whoo-um. Yeah? Underneath. Jump.
p205
aVUnderneath. Jump. Paolo, kick. Don't care where. Kick.
p206
aVKick, replace, change a leg. Kick, replace, change the leg.
p207
aVYeah? Okay? Cat, almost get his head. Almost get his head.
p208
aVWhoaa. Just after it, maybe. Whoaa, whaaay, ooh.
p209
aVGrab her waist, come up back into her first, whoom, spin,
p210
aVturn her, whoo-aa. (Snaps) Great.
p211
aVOkay, let's have a little go from the beginning of that.
p212
aVJust, let me slow down here. Fancy having eight \u2014 (Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VFancy having eight hours with me in a day.
p215
aVSo, maybe too much. So, here we go, ready, and \u2014 (Clicks metronome)
p216
aa(lp217
V(Clicks metronome)
p218
aa(lp219
VNice, good job. Yeah? Okay. (Applause)
p220
aVOkay, not bad. (Applause) A little bit more?
p221
aVYeah. Just a little bit more, here we go, from that place.
p222
aVSeparate. Face the front. Separate. Face the front.
p223
aVImagine that there's a circle in front of you, yeah?
p224
aVAvoid it. Avoid it. Whoom. Kick it out of the way.
p225
aVKick it out of the way. Throw it into the audience. Whoom.
p226
aVThrow it into the audience again.
p227
aVWe've got mental architecture, we're sharing it,
p228
aVtherefore solving a problem. They're enacting it.
p229
aVLet me just see that a little bit. Ready, and go.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Clicks metronome)
p232
aa(lp233
VOkay, brilliant. Okay, here we go. From the beginning,
p234
aVcan we do our phrases first? And then that.
p235
aVAnd we're going to build something now, organize it,
p236
aVthe phrases. Here we go. Nice and slow?
p237
aVReady and go ... um. (Clicks metronome)
p238
aa(lp239
V(Clicks metronome)
p240
aVThe duet starts. (Clicks metronome)
p241
aV(Clicks metronome)
p242
aVSo yeah, okay, good. Okay, nice, very nice. (Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VSo good. So \u2014 (Applause)
p245
aVOkay. So that was \u2014 (Applause)
p246
aVWell done. (Applause)
p247
aa(lp248
VThat was the second way of working.
p249
aVThe first one, body-to-body transfer, yeah,
p250
aVwith an outside mental architecture that I work with
p251
aVthat they hold memory with for me.
p252
aVThe second one, which is using them as objects to think
p253
aVwith their architectural objects, I do a series of
p254
aVprovocations, I say, "If this happens, then that.
p255
aVIf this, if that happens \u2014 " I've got lots of methods like that,
p256
aVbut it's very, very quick, and this is a third method.
p257
aVThey're starting it already, and this is a task-based method,
p258
aVwhere they have the autonomy to make
p259
aVall of the decisions for themselves.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo I'd like us just to do, we're going to do a little
p262
aVmental dance, a little, in this little one minute,
p263
aVso what I'd love you to do is imagine,
p264
aVyou can do this with your eyes closed, or open, and if you
p265
aVdon't want to do it you can watch them, it's up to you.
p266
aVJust for a second, think about that word "TED" in front of
p267
aVyou, so it's in mind, and it's there right in front of your mind.
p268
aVWhat I'd like you to do is transplant that outside
p269
aVinto the real world, so just imagine that word "TED"
p270
aVin the real world.
p271
aVWhat I'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it.
p272
aVI'm going to zone in on the "E," and I'm going to
p273
aVscale that "E" so it's absolutely massive,
p274
aVso I'm scaling that "E" so it's absolutely massive,
p275
aVand then I'm going to give it dimensionality.
p276
aVI'm going to think about it in 3D space. So now,
p277
aVinstead of it just being a letter that's in front of me,
p278
aVit's a space that my body can go inside of.
p279
aVI now decide where I'm going to be in that space,
p280
aVso I'm down on this small part of the bottom rib
p281
aVof the letter "E," and I'm thinking about it, and I'm imagining
p282
aVthis space that's really high and above. If I asked you to
p283
aVreach out \u2014 you don't have to literally do it, but in mind \u2014
p284
aVreach out to the top of the "E," where would you reach?
p285
aVIf you reach with your finger, where would it be?
p286
aVIf you reach with your elbow, where would it be?
p287
aVIf I already then said about that space that you're in,
p288
aVlet's infuse it with the color red, what does that do
p289
aVto the body? If I then said to you, what happens if
p290
aVthat whole wall on the side of "E" collapses and you have to
p291
aVuse your weight to put it back up,
p292
aVwhat would you be able to do with it?
p293
aa(lp294
VSo this is a mental picture, I'm describing a mental,
p295
aVvivid picture that enables dancers to make choices
p296
aVfor themselves about what to make.
p297
aa(lp298
VOkay, you can open your eyes if you had them closed.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo the dancers have been working on them.
p301
aVSo just keep working on them for a little second.
p302
aVSo they've been working on those mental architectures in the here.
p303
aVI know, I think we should keep them as a surprise.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo here goes, world premiere dance. Yeah? Here we go.
p306
aVTED dance. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to organize it quickly.
p307
aVSo, you're going to do the first solo that we made,
p308
aVyeah blah blah blah blah, we go into the duet, yeah,
p309
aVblah blah blah blah. The next solo, blah blah blah blah,
p310
aVyeah, and both at the same time, you do the last solutions.
p311
aa(lp312
VOkay? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, world premiere,
p313
aVTED dance, three versions of physical thinking. (Applause)
p314
aVWell, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah? (Laughter)
p315
aVSo yeah, let's clap \u2014 yeah, let's clap afterwards.
p316
aVHere we go. Catarina, big moment, here we go, one.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Clicks metronome)
p319
aVHere it comes, Cat. (Clicks metronome)
p320
aVPaolo, go. (Clicks metronome) Last you solo.
p321
aVThe one you made. (Clicks metronome)
p322
aV(Clicks metronome)
p323
aVWell done. Okay, good. Super. So \u2014
p324
aa(lp325
V(Applause)
p326
aVSo \u2014 (Applause)
p327
aVThank you. (Applause)
p328
aVSo \u2014 three versions. (Applause) Oh. (Laughs)
p329
aV(Applause) Three versions of physical thinking, yeah?
p330
aVThree versions of physical thinking. I'm hoping that today,
p331
aVwhat you're going to do is go away and make a dance
p332
aVfor yourself, and if not that,
p333
aVat least misbehave more beautifully, more often.
p334
aa(lp335
VThank you very much. (Applause)
p336
aVThank you. Thank you. (Applause)
p337
aVHere we go. (Applause)

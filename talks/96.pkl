(lp4
VThank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited.
p5
aVMy excitement is: I get a chance to give something back.
p6
aVMy challenge is: the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VI'm not exaggerating. I do weekends \u2014
p11
aVI do more, obviously, I also coach people \u2014
p12
aVbut I'm into immersion, because how did you learn language?
p13
aVNot just by learning principles,
p14
aVyou got in it and you did it so often that it became real.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe bottom line of why I'm here, besides being a crazy mofo, is that \u2014
p17
aVI'm not here to motivate you, you don't need that, obviously.
p18
aVOften that's what people think I do,
p19
aVand it's the furthest thing from it.
p20
aVWhat happens, though, is people say to me,
p21
aV"I don't need any motivation."
p22
aVBut that's not what I do.
p23
aVI'm the "why" guy.
p24
aVI want to know why you do what you do.
p25
aa(lp26
VWhat is your motive for action?
p27
aVWhat is it that drives you in your life today? Not 10 years ago.
p28
aVAre you running the same pattern?
p29
aVBecause I believe that the invisible force of internal drive, activated,
p30
aVis the most important thing.
p31
aVI'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life.
p32
aVAll of us here have great minds.
p33
aVMost of us here have great minds, right?
p34
aVWe all know how to think.
p35
aVWith our minds we can rationalize anything.
p36
aVWe can make anything happen.
p37
aa(lp38
VI agree with what was described a few days ago,
p39
aVthat people work in their self-interest.
p40
aVBut we know that that's bullshit at times.
p41
aVYou don't work in your self-interest all the time,
p42
aVbecause when emotion comes into it,
p43
aVthe wiring changes in the way it functions.
p44
aVSo it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is,
p45
aVespecially those who are very smart can play this game in our head.
p46
aVBut I really want to know what's driving you.
p47
aa(lp48
VWhat I would like to invite you to do
p49
aVby the end of this talk is explore where you are today, for two reasons.
p50
aVOne: so that you can contribute more.
p51
aVAnd two: that hopefully we can not just understand other people more,
p52
aVbut appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections
p53
aVthat can stop some of the challenges that we face today.
p54
aVThey're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us,
p55
aVbecause it's making us intersect.
p56
aVThat intersection doesn't always create a view
p57
aVof "everybody now understands everybody,
p58
aVand everybody appreciates everybody."
p59
aa(lp60
VI've had an obsession basically for 30 years,
p61
aV"What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives?
p62
aVWhat in their performance?"
p63
aVI got hired to produce the result now.
p64
aVI've done it for 30 years.
p65
aVI get the phone call
p66
aVwhen the athlete is burning down on national television,
p67
aVand they were ahead by five strokes
p68
aVand now they can't get back on the course.
p69
aVI've got to do something right now or nothing matters.
p70
aVI get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide,
p71
aVI've got to do something.
p72
aVIn 29 years, I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one.
p73
aVIt doesn't mean I won't some day, but I haven't yet.
p74
aVThe reason is an understanding of these human needs.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhen I get those calls about performance, that's one thing.
p77
aVHow do you make a change?
p78
aVI'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute,
p79
aVto do something beyond themselves.
p80
aVMaybe the real question is,
p81
aVI look at life and say there's two master lessons.
p82
aVOne is: there's the science of achievement,
p83
aVwhich almost everyone here has mastered amazingly.
p84
aV"How do you take the invisible and make it visible,"
p85
aVHow do you make your dreams happen?
p86
aVYour business, your contribution to society, money \u2014
p87
aVwhatever, your body, your family.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment.
p90
aVBecause science is easy, right?
p91
aVWe know the rules, you write the code and you get the results.
p92
aVOnce you know the game, you just up the ante, don't you?
p93
aVBut when it comes to fulfillment \u2014 that's an art.
p94
aVThe reason is, it's about appreciation and contribution.
p95
aVYou can only feel so much by yourself.
p96
aa(lp97
VI've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question
p98
aVhow somebody's life changes
p99
aVif you look at them like those people that you've given everything to?
p100
aVLike all the resources they say they need.
p101
aVYou gave not a 100-dollar computer, but the best computer.
p102
aVYou gave them love, joy, were there to comfort them.
p103
aVThose people very often \u2014 you know some of them \u2014
p104
aVend up the rest of their life
p105
aVwith all this love, education, money and background
p106
aVgoing in and out of rehab.
p107
aVSome people have been through ultimate pain,
p108
aVpsychologically, sexually, spiritually, emotionally abused \u2014
p109
aVand not always, but often,
p110
aVthey become some of the people that contribute the most to society.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe question we've got to ask ourselves really is, what is it?
p113
aVWhat is it that shapes us?
p114
aVWe live in a therapy culture.
p115
aVMost of us don't do that, but the culture's a therapy culture,
p116
aVthe mindset that we are our past.
p117
aVAnd you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that,
p118
aVbut most of society thinks biography is destiny.
p119
aVThe past equals the future.
p120
aVOf course it does if you live there.
p121
aVBut what we know and what we have to remind ourselves \u2014
p122
aVbecause you can know something intellectually
p123
aVand then not use it, not apply it.
p124
aa(lp125
VWe've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power.
p126
aVWhen you ask people,
p127
aVhave you failed to achieve something significant in your life?
p128
aa(lp129
VSay, "Aye." Audience: Aye.
p130
aa(lp131
VTR: Thanks for the interaction on a high level there.
p132
aVBut if you ask people, why didn't you achieve something?
p133
aVSomebody who's working for you, or a partner, or even yourself.
p134
aVWhen you fail to achieve, what's the reason people say?
p135
aVWhat do they tell you?
p136
aVDidn't have the knowledge, didn't have the money,
p137
aVdidn't have the time, didn't have the technology.
p138
aVI didn't have the right manager.
p139
aa(lp140
VAl Gore: Supreme Court. TR: The Supreme Court.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
V(Applause) (Cheering)
p145
aa(lp146
V(Applause continues)
p147
aa(lp148
VTR: And \u2014
p149
aa(lp150
V(Applause)
p151
aa(lp152
VWhat do all those, including the Supreme Court, have in common?
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VThey are a claim to you missing resources, and they may be accurate.
p157
aVYou may not have the money, or the Supreme Court,
p158
aVbut that is not the defining factor.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Applause) (Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd you correct me if I'm wrong.
p163
aVThe defining factor is never resources; it's resourcefulness.
p164
aVAnd what I mean specifically, rather than just some phrase,
p165
aVis if you have emotion, human emotion,
p166
aVsomething that I experienced from you the day before yesterday
p167
aVat a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced
p168
aVand I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won.
p169
aa(lp170
VAudience: Yeah!
p171
aa(lp172
V(Applause) (Cheering)
p173
aa(lp174
VHow easy for me to tell him what he should do.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VIdiot, Robbins.
p179
aVBut I know when we watched the debate at that time,
p180
aVthere were emotions that blocked people's ability
p181
aVto get this man's intellect and capacity.
p182
aVAnd the way that it came across to some people on that day \u2014
p183
aVbecause I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't,
p184
aVand I was upset.
p185
aVBut there was emotion there.
p186
aVDo you know what I'm talking about?
p187
aa(lp188
VSay, "Aye." Audience: Aye.
p189
aa(lp190
VTR: So, emotion is it.
p191
aVAnd if we get the right emotion, we can get ourselves to do anything.
p192
aVIf you're creative, playful, fun enough,
p193
aVcan you get through to anybody, yes or no?
p194
aa(lp195
VIf you don't have the money,
p196
aVbut you're creative and determined, you find the way.
p197
aVThis is the ultimate resource.
p198
aVBut this is not the story that people tell us.
p199
aVThey tell us a bunch of different stories.
p200
aVThey tell us we don't have the resources, but ultimately,
p201
aVif you take a look here,
p202
aVthey say, what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that?
p203
aVHe's broken my pattern, that son-of-a-bitch.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VBut I appreciated the energy, I'll tell you that.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VWhat determines your resources?
p212
aVWe've said decisions shape destiny, which is my focus here.
p213
aVIf decisions shape destiny, what determines it is three decisions.
p214
aVWhat will you focus on?
p215
aVYou have to decide what you're going to focus on.
p216
aVConsciously or unconsciously.
p217
aVthe minute you decide to focus, you must give it a meaning,
p218
aVand that meaning produces emotion.
p219
aVIs this the end or the beginning?
p220
aVIs God punishing me or rewarding me, or is this the roll of the dice?
p221
aVAn emotion creates what we're going to do, or the action.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo, think about your own life,
p224
aVthe decisions that have shaped your destiny.
p225
aVAnd that sounds really heavy, but in the last five or 10 years,
p226
aVhave there been some decisions
p227
aVthat if you'd made a different decision, your life would be completely different?
p228
aVHow many can think about it? Better or worse. Say, "Aye."
p229
aa(lp230
VAudience: Aye.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo the bottom line is, maybe it was where to go to work,
p233
aVand you met the love of your life there, a career decision.
p234
aVI know the Google geniuses I saw here \u2014
p235
aVI mean, I understand that their decision was to sell their technology.
p236
aVWhat if they made that decision versus to build their own culture?
p237
aVHow would the world or their lives be different, their impact?
p238
aVThe history of our world is these decisions.
p239
aVWhen a woman stands up and says, "No, I won't go to the back of the bus."
p240
aVShe didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture.
p241
aVOr someone standing in front of a tank.
p242
aVOr being in a position like Lance Armstrong,
p243
aV"You've got testicular cancer."
p244
aVThat's pretty tough for any male, especially if you ride a bike.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VYou've got it in your brain; you've got it in your lungs.
p249
aVBut what was his decision of what to focus on?
p250
aVDifferent than most people. What did it mean?
p251
aVIt wasn't the end; it was the beginning.
p252
aVHe goes off and wins seven championships he never once won
p253
aVbefore the cancer, because he got emotional fitness, psychological strength.
p254
aVThat's the difference in human beings that I've seen
p255
aVof the three million I've been around.
p256
aa(lp257
VIn my lab, I've had three million people from 80 countries over the last 29 years.
p258
aVAnd after a while, patterns become obvious.
p259
aVYou see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way, right?
p260
aVOthers say, "Oh, that sounds ridiculous." It's simple.
p261
aVSo, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?
p262
aVTwo invisible forces. Very quickly. One: state.
p263
aVWe all have had times,
p264
aVyou did something, and after, you thought to yourself,
p265
aV"I can't believe I said or did that, that was so stupid."
p266
aVWho's been there? Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.
p267
aa(lp268
VOr after you did something, you go, "That was me!"
p269
aa(lp270
V(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VIt wasn't your ability; it was your state.
p273
aVYour model of the world is what shapes you long term.
p274
aVYour model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us.
p275
aVIt makes people make decisions.
p276
aVTo influence somebody, we need to know what already influences them.
p277
aVIt's made up of three parts.
p278
aVFirst, what's your target? What are you after?
p279
aVIt's not your desires.
p280
aVYou can get your desires or goals.
p281
aVWho has ever got a goal or desire and thought, is this all there is?
p282
aa(lp283
VSay, "Aye." Audience: Aye.
p284
aa(lp285
VIt's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs.
p286
aVSecond, once you know what the target that's driving you is
p287
aVand you uncover it for the truth \u2014 you don't form it \u2014
p288
aVthen you find out what's your map,
p289
aVwhat's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs.
p290
aVSome people think the way to get them is to destroy the world,
p291
aVsome people, to build, create something, love someone.
p292
aVThere's the fuel you pick. So very quickly, six needs.
p293
aa(lp294
VLet me tell you what they are. First one: certainty.
p295
aVThese are not goals or desires, these are universal.
p296
aVEveryone needs certainty they can avoid pain
p297
aVand at least be comfortable.
p298
aVNow, how do you get it?
p299
aVControl everybody? Develop a skill? Give up? Smoke a cigarette?
p300
aVAnd if you got totally certain, ironically,
p301
aVeven though we need that \u2014
p302
aVyou're not certain about your health, or your children, or money.
p303
aVIf you're not sure the ceiling will hold up,
p304
aVyou won't listen to any speaker.
p305
aVWhile we go for certainty differently, if we get total certainty, we get what?
p306
aVWhat do you feel if you're certain?
p307
aVYou know what will happen, when and how it will happen,
p308
aVwhat would you feel?
p309
aVBored out of your minds. So, God, in Her infinite wisdom,
p310
aVgave us a second human need, which is uncertainty.
p311
aVWe need variety. We need surprise.
p312
aVHow many of you here love surprises? Say, "Aye."
p313
aa(lp314
VAudience: Aye.
p315
aa(lp316
VTR: Bullshit. You like the surprises you want.
p317
aVThe ones you don't want, you call problems, but you need them.
p318
aVSo, variety is important.
p319
aVHave you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen?
p320
aVWho's done this? Get a fucking life.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VWhy are you doing it?
p325
aVYou're certain it's good because you read or saw it before,
p326
aVbut you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten,
p327
aVand there's variety.
p328
aa(lp329
VThird human need, critical: significance.
p330
aVWe all need to feel important, special, unique.
p331
aVYou can get it by making more money or being more spiritual.
p332
aVYou can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put
p333
aVmore tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know.
p334
aVWhatever it takes.
p335
aVThe fastest way to do this,
p336
aVif you have no background, no culture, no belief and resources
p337
aVor resourcefulness, is violence.
p338
aVIf I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant.
p339
aVZero to 10. How high? 10.
p340
aVHow certain am I that you're going to respond to me? 10.
p341
aVHow much uncertainty?
p342
aVWho knows what's going to happen next? Kind of exciting.
p343
aVLike climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff
p344
aVall the way down there.
p345
aVTotal variety and uncertainty.
p346
aVAnd it's significant, isn't it? So you want to risk your life for it.
p347
aVSo that's why violence has always been around and will be around
p348
aVunless we have a consciousness change as a species.
p349
aVYou can get significance a million ways,
p350
aVbut to be significant, you've got to be unique and different.
p351
aa(lp352
VHere's what we really need: connection and love, fourth need.
p353
aVWe all want it;
p354
aVmost settle for connection, love's too scary.
p355
aVWho here has been hurt in an intimate relationship?
p356
aVIf you don't raise your hand, you've had other shit, too.
p357
aVAnd you're going to get hurt again.
p358
aVAren't you glad you came to this positive visit?
p359
aVHere's what's true: we need it.
p360
aVWe can do it through intimacy, friendship, prayer,
p361
aVthrough walking in nature.
p362
aVIf nothing else works for you, don't get a cat, get a dog,
p363
aVbecause if you leave for two minutes, it's like you've been gone six months,
p364
aVwhen you come back 5 minutes later.
p365
aa(lp366
VThese first four needs, every human finds a way to meet.
p367
aVEven if you lie to yourself, you need to have split personalities.
p368
aVI call the first four needs the needs of the personality.
p369
aVThe last two are the needs of the spirit.
p370
aVAnd this is where fulfillment comes.
p371
aVYou won't get it from the first four.
p372
aVYou'll figure a way, smoke, drink, do whatever, meet the first four.
p373
aVBut number five, you must grow.
p374
aVWe all know the answer.
p375
aVIf you don't grow, you're what?
p376
aVIf a relationship or business is not growing,
p377
aVif you're not growing,
p378
aVdoesn't matter how much money or friends you have,
p379
aVhow many love you,
p380
aVyou feel like hell.
p381
aVAnd I believe the reason we grow
p382
aVis so we have something to give of value.
p383
aa(lp384
VBecause the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves.
p385
aVBecause we all know, corny as that sounds,
p386
aVthe secret to living is giving.
p387
aVWe all know life is not about me, it's about we.
p388
aVThis culture knows that, this room knows that.
p389
aVIt's exciting.
p390
aVWhen you see Nicholas talking about his $100 computer,
p391
aVthe most exciting thing is:
p392
aVhere's a genius, but he's got a calling now.
p393
aVYou can feel the difference in him, and it's beautiful.
p394
aVAnd that calling can touch other people.
p395
aa(lp396
VMy life was touched because when I was 11 years old,
p397
aVThanksgiving, no money, no food,
p398
aVwe were not going to starve,
p399
aVbut my father was totally messed up,
p400
aVmy mom was letting him know how bad he messed up,
p401
aVand somebody came to the door and delivered food.
p402
aVMy father made three decisions, I know what they were, briefly.
p403
aVHis focus was "This is charity.
p404
aVWhat does it mean? I'm worthless.
p405
aVWhat do I have to do? Leave my family," which he did.
p406
aVIt was one of the most painful experiences of life.
p407
aVMy three decisions gave me a different path.
p408
aVI set focus on "There's food." What a concept!
p409
aa(lp410
V(Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
VBut this is what changed my life, shaped me as a human being.
p413
aVSomebody's gift, I don't even know who it is.
p414
aVMy father always said, "No one gives a shit."
p415
aVAnd now somebody I don't know,
p416
aVthey're not asking for anything, just giving us food,
p417
aVlooking out for us.
p418
aVIt made me believe this: that strangers care.
p419
aVAnd that made me decide,
p420
aVif strangers care about me and my family, I care about them.
p421
aVI'm going to do something to make a difference.
p422
aVSo when I was 17, I went out on Thanksgiving,
p423
aVit was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families.
p424
aVThe most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life.
p425
aVNext year, I did four, then eight.
p426
aVI didn't tell anybody what I was doing, I wasn't doing it for brownie points.
p427
aVBut after eight, I thought I could use some help.
p428
aa(lp429
VSo I went out, got my friends involved,
p430
aVthen I grew companies, got 11, and I built the foundation.
p431
aV18 years later,
p432
aVI'm proud to tell you last year we fed 2 million people in 35 countries
p433
aVthrough our foundation.
p434
aVAll during the holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas,
p435
aVin different countries around the world.
p436
aa(lp437
V(Applause)
p438
aa(lp439
VThank you.
p440
aVI don't tell you that to brag, but because I'm proud of human beings
p441
aVbecause they get excited to contribute
p442
aVonce they've had the chance to experience it, not talk about it.
p443
aa(lp444
VSo, finally \u2014 I'm about out of time.
p445
aVThe target that shapes you \u2014
p446
aVHere's what's different about people.
p447
aVWe have the same needs.
p448
aVBut are you a certainty freak, is that what you value most,
p449
aVor uncertainty?
p450
aVThis man couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves.
p451
aVAre you driven by significance or love?
p452
aVWe all need all six,
p453
aVbut what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction.
p454
aVAnd as you move in a direction, you have a destination or destiny.
p455
aVThe second piece is the map.
p456
aVThe operating system tells you how to get there,
p457
aVand some people's map is,
p458
aV"I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people,"
p459
aVand they're a fireman,
p460
aVand somebody else says, "I'm going to kill people to do it."
p461
aVThey're trying to meet the same needs of significance.
p462
aVThey want to honor God or honor their family.
p463
aVBut they have a different map.
p464
aa(lp465
VAnd there are seven different beliefs; I can't go through them, because I'm done.
p466
aVThe last piece is emotion.
p467
aVOne of the parts of the map is like time.
p468
aVSome people's idea of a long time is 100 years.
p469
aVSomebody else's is three seconds, which is what I have.
p470
aVAnd the last one I've already mentioned that fell to you.
p471
aVIf you've got a target and a map \u2014
p472
aVI can't use Google because I love Macs,
p473
aVand they haven't made it good for Macs yet.
p474
aVSo if you use MapQuest \u2014
p475
aVhow many have made this fatal mistake of using it?
p476
aVYou use this thing and you don't get there.
p477
aVImagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go.
p478
aa(lp479
V(Laughter)
p480
aa(lp481
VThe last thing is emotion.
p482
aVHere's what I'll tell you about emotion.
p483
aVThere are 6,000 emotions
p484
aVthat we have words for in the English language,
p485
aVwhich is just a linguistic representation that changes by language.
p486
aVBut if your dominant emotions \u2014
p487
aVIf I have 20,000 people or 1,000
p488
aVand I have them write down all the emotions that they experience
p489
aVin an average week,
p490
aVand I give them as long as they need,
p491
aVand on one side they write empowering emotions,
p492
aVthe other's disempowering,
p493
aVguess how many emotions they experience? Less than 12.
p494
aVAnd half of those make them feel like shit.
p495
aVThey have six good feelings.
p496
aVHappy, happy, excited, oh shit,
p497
aVfrustrated, frustrated, overwhelmed, depressed.
p498
aVHow many of you know somebody
p499
aVwho, no matter what happens, finds a way to get pissed off?
p500
aa(lp501
V(Laughter)
p502
aa(lp503
VOr no matter what happens, they find a way to be happy or excited.
p504
aVHow many of you know somebody like this?
p505
aa(lp506
VWhen 9/11 happened, I'll finish with this, I was in Hawaii.
p507
aVI was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,
p508
aVwe were translating four languages simultaneously
p509
aVfor a program I was conducting, for a week.
p510
aVThe night before was called Emotional Mastery.
p511
aVI got up, had no plan for this, and I said \u2014
p512
aVwe had fireworks, I do crazy shit, fun stuff,
p513
aVand at the end, I stopped.
p514
aVI had this plan, but I never know what I'm going to say.
p515
aVAnd all of a sudden, I said,
p516
aV"When do people really start to live? When they face death."
p517
aVAnd I went through this whole thing
p518
aVabout, if you weren't going to get off this island,
p519
aVif nine days from now, you were going to die,
p520
aVwho would you call, what would you say, what would you do?
p521
aVThat night is when 9/11 happened.
p522
aa(lp523
VOne woman had come to the seminar, and when she came there,
p524
aVher previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered.
p525
aVHer new boyfriend wanted to marry her, and she said no.
p526
aa(lp527
VHe said, "If you go to that Hawaii thing, it's over with us."
p528
aVShe said, "It's over."
p529
aVWhen I finished that night, she called him and left a message
p530
aVat the top of the World Trade Center where he worked, saying,
p531
aV"I love you, I want you to know I want to marry you.
p532
aVIt was stupid of me."
p533
aVShe was asleep, because it was 3 a.m. for us, when he called her back,
p534
aVand said, "Honey, I can't tell you what this means.
p535
aVI don't know how to tell you this, but you gave me the greatest gift,
p536
aVbecause I'm going to die."
p537
aVAnd she played the recording for us in the room.
p538
aVShe was on Larry King later.
p539
aVAnd he said, "You're probably wondering
p540
aVhow on Earth this could happen to you twice.
p541
aVAll I can say is this must be God's message to you.
p542
aVFrom now on, every day, give your all, love your all.
p543
aVDon't let anything ever stop you."
p544
aVShe finishes, and a man stands up, and he says,
p545
aV"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.
p546
aVI'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry,
p547
aVbut frankly, this is retribution."
p548
aVI can't tell you the rest, because I'm out of time.
p549
aa(lp550
V(Laughter)
p551
aa(lp552
VAre you sure?
p553
aa(lp554
V(Laughter)
p555
aa(lp556
V10 seconds!
p557
aa(lp558
V(Laughter and applause)
p559
aa(lp560
V10 seconds, I want to be respectful.
p561
aVAll I can tell you is,
p562
aVI brought this man on stage
p563
aVwith a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center,
p564
aVbecause I had about 200 New Yorkers there.
p565
aVMore than 50 lost their entire companies, friends,
p566
aVmarking off their Palm Pilots.
p567
aVOne financial trader, woman made of steel, bawling \u2014
p568
aV30 friends crossing off that all died.
p569
aVAnd I said, "What are we going to focus on?
p570
aVWhat does this mean and what are we going to do?"
p571
aa(lp572
VAnd I got the group to focus on:
p573
aVif you didn't lose somebody today,
p574
aVyour focus is going to be how to serve somebody else.
p575
aVThen one woman stood up and was so angry, screaming and yelling.
p576
aVI found out she wasn't from New York, she's not an American,
p577
aVdoesn't know anybody here.
p578
aVI asked, "Do you always get angry?"
p579
aVShe said, "Yes."
p580
aVGuilty people got guilty, sad people got sad.
p581
aVI took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation.
p582
aVJewish man with family in the occupied territory,
p583
aVsomeone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day,
p584
aVand this man who wanted to be a terrorist,
p585
aVand I made it very clear.
p586
aVThis integration is on a film, which I'd be happy to send you,
p587
aVinstead of my verbalization,
p588
aVbut the two of them not only came together
p589
aVand changed their beliefs and models of the world,
p590
aVbut worked together to bring, for almost four years now,
p591
aVthrough various mosques and synagogues,
p592
aVthe idea of how to create peace.
p593
aVAnd he wrote a book, called "My Jihad, My Way of Peace."
p594
aVSo, transformation can happen.
p595
aa(lp596
VMy invitation to you is:
p597
aVexplore your web,
p598
aVthe web in here \u2014
p599
aVthe needs, the beliefs, the emotions that are controlling you,
p600
aVfor two reasons:
p601
aVso there's more of you to give, and achieve, too,
p602
aVbut I mean give,
p603
aVbecause that's what's going to fill you up.
p604
aVAnd secondly, so you can appreciate \u2014
p605
aVnot just understand, that's intellectual, that's the mind,
p606
aVbut appreciate what's driving other people.
p607
aVIt's the only way our world's going to change.
p608
aa(lp609
VGod bless you, thank you. I hope this was of service.
p610
aa(lp611
V(Applause)

What&#39;s less known about the iconic motivational speaker is <strong>the range and stature of his personal clients. From CEOs to heads of state to Olympic athletes</strong>, a wide swath of high-performing professionals (who are already plenty motivated, thank you very much) look to him for help reaching their full potential.<br /><br />Robbins&#39; expertise in leadership psychology is what brought him to TED, where his spontaneous on-stage interaction with Al Gore created an unforgettable TED moment. It also perfectly demonstrated Robbins&#39; direct -- even confrontational -- approach, which calls on his listeners to look within themselves, and <strong>find the inner blocks that prevent them from finding fulfillment and success</strong>. Some of his techniques -- firewalking, for example -- are magnets for criticism, but his underlying message is unassailable: We all have the ability to make a positive impact on the world, and it&#39;s up to us, as individuals, to overcome our fears and foibles to reach that potential.<br /><br />Robbins has won many accolades for his work -- including <strong>his memorable performance in the Jack Black comedy </strong><em><strong>Shallow Hal</strong>.</em> (It was a small but vital role.) His <a href=\\"http://www.anthonyrobbinsfoundation.org/arf/index.php\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Anthony Robbins Foundation</a>  works with the homeless, elderly and inner-city youth, and feeds more than 2 million people annually through its <a href=\\"http://www.anthonyrobbinsfoundation.org/arf/inter_bb.php\\" target=\\"_blank\\">International Basket Brigade</a>.</p>", "slug": "tony_robbins", "whotheyare": "Tony Robbins makes it his business to know why we do the things we do.

Robbins might have one of the world&#39;s most famous smiles; his beaming confidence has helped sell his best-selling line of self-help books, and fill even his 10,000-seat seminars. What&#39;s less known about the iconic motivational speaker is <strong>the range and stature of his personal clients. From CEOs to heads of state to Olympic athletes</strong>, a wide swath of high-performing professionals (who are already plenty motivated, thank you very much) look to him for help reaching their full potential.<br /><br />Robbins&#39; expertise in leadership psychology is what brought him to TED, where his spontaneous on-stage interaction with Al Gore created an unforgettable TED moment. It also perfectly demonstrated Robbins&#39; direct -- even confrontational -- approach, which calls on his listeners to look within themselves, and <strong>find the inner blocks that prevent them from finding fulfillment and success</strong>. Some of his techniques -- firewalking, for example -- are magnets for criticism, but his underlying message is unassailable: We all have the ability to make a positive impact on the world, and it&#39;s up to us, as individuals, to overcome our fears and foibles to reach that potential.<br /><br />Robbins has won many accolades for his work -- including <strong>his memorable performance in the Jack Black comedy </strong><em><strong>Shallow Hal</strong>.</em> (It was a small but vital role.) His <a href=\\"http://www.anthonyrobbinsfoundation.org/arf/index.php\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Anthony Robbins Foundation</a>  works with the homeless, elderly and inner-city youth, and feeds more than 2 million people annually through its <a href=\\"http://www.anthonyrobbinsfoundation.org/arf/inter_bb.php\\" target=\\"_blank\\">International Basket Brigade</a>.</p>", "slug": "tony_robbins", "whotheyare": "Tony Robbins makes it his business to know why we do the things we do.

VI'd like to take you to another world.
p5
aVAnd I'd like to share
p6
aVa 45 year-old love story
p7
aVwith the poor,
p8
aVliving on less than one dollar a day.
p9
aVI went to a very elitist, snobbish,
p10
aVexpensive education in India,
p11
aVand that almost destroyed me.
p12
aVI was all set
p13
aVto be a diplomat, teacher, doctor \u2014
p14
aVall laid out.
p15
aVThen, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion
p16
aVfor three years.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVThe whole world was laid out for me.
p19
aVEverything was at my feet.
p20
aVI could do nothing wrong.
p21
aVAnd then I thought out of curiosity
p22
aVI'd like to go and live and work
p23
aVand just see what a village is like.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo in 1965,
p26
aVI went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India,
p27
aVand I saw starvation, death,
p28
aVpeople dying of hunger, for the first time.
p29
aVIt changed my life.
p30
aVI came back home,
p31
aVtold my mother,
p32
aV"I'd like to live and work in a village."
p33
aVMother went into a coma.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aV"What is this?
p36
aVThe whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you,
p37
aVand you want to go and work in a village?
p38
aVI mean, is there something wrong with you?"
p39
aVI said, "No, I've got the best eduction.
p40
aVIt made me think.
p41
aVAnd I wanted to give something back
p42
aVin my own way."
p43
aV"What do you want to do in a village?
p44
aVNo job, no money,
p45
aVno security, no prospect."
p46
aVI said, "I want to live
p47
aVand dig wells for five years."
p48
aV"Dig wells for five years?
p49
aVYou went to the most expensive school and college in India,
p50
aVand you want to dig wells for five years?"
p51
aVShe didn't speak to me for a very long time,
p52
aVbecause she thought I'd let my family down.
p53
aa(lp54
VBut then,
p55
aVI was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills
p56
aVthat very poor people have,
p57
aVwhich are never brought into the mainstream \u2014
p58
aVwhich is never identified, respected,
p59
aVapplied on a large scale.
p60
aVAnd I thought I'd start a Barefoot College \u2014
p61
aVcollege only for the poor.
p62
aVWhat the poor thought was important
p63
aVwould be reflected in the college.
p64
aVI went to this village for the first time.
p65
aVElders came to me
p66
aVand said, "Are you running from the police?"
p67
aVI said, "No."
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aV"You failed in your exam?"
p70
aVI said, "No."
p71
aV"You didn't get a government job?" I said, "No."
p72
aV"What are you doing here?
p73
aVWhy are you here?
p74
aVThe education system in India
p75
aVmakes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich;
p76
aVwhat are you doing in this village?
p77
aVIs there something wrong with you you're not telling us?"
p78
aVI said, "No, I want to actually start a college
p79
aVonly for the poor.
p80
aVWhat the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."
p81
aa(lp82
VSo the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.
p83
aVThey said, "Please,
p84
aVdon't bring anyone with a degree and qualification
p85
aVinto your college."
p86
aVSo it's the only college in India
p87
aVwhere, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's,
p88
aVyou are disqualified to come.
p89
aVYou have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout
p90
aVto come to our college.
p91
aVYou have to work with your hands.
p92
aVYou have to have a dignity of labor.
p93
aVYou have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community
p94
aVand provide a service to the community.
p95
aVSo we started the Barefoot College,
p96
aVand we redefined professionalism.
p97
aa(lp98
VWho is a professional?
p99
aVA professional is someone
p100
aVwho has a combination of competence,
p101
aVconfidence and belief.
p102
aVA water diviner is a professional.
p103
aVA traditional midwife
p104
aVis a professional.
p105
aVA traditional bone setter is a professional.
p106
aVThese are professionals all over the world.
p107
aVYou find them in any inaccessible village around the world.
p108
aVAnd we thought that these people should come into the mainstream
p109
aVand show that the knowledge and skills that they have
p110
aVis universal.
p111
aVIt needs to be used, needs to be applied,
p112
aVneeds to be shown to the world outside \u2014
p113
aVthat these knowledge and skills
p114
aVare relevant even today.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo the college works
p117
aVfollowing the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.
p118
aVYou eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.
p119
aVThere are no contracts, no written contracts.
p120
aVYou can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.
p121
aVAnd no one can get more than $100 a month.
p122
aVYou come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.
p123
aVYou come for the work and the challenge,
p124
aVyou'll come to the Barefoot College.
p125
aVThat is where we want you to try crazy ideas.
p126
aVWhatever idea you have, come and try it.
p127
aVIt doesn't matter if you fail.
p128
aVBattered, bruised, you start again.
p129
aVIt's the only college where the teacher is the learner
p130
aVand the learner is the teacher.
p131
aVAnd it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.
p132
aVYou are certified by the community you serve.
p133
aVYou don't need a paper to hang on the wall
p134
aVto show that you are an engineer.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo when I said that,
p137
aVthey said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing?
p138
aVThis is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."
p139
aVSo we built the first Barefoot College
p140
aVin 1986.
p141
aVIt was built by 12 Barefoot architects
p142
aVwho can't read and write,
p143
aVbuilt on $1.50 a sq. ft.
p144
aV150 people lived there, worked there.
p145
aVThey got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.
p146
aVBut then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.
p147
aVI said, "Yes, they made the blueprints,
p148
aVbut the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."
p149
aVWe are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000,
p150
aVbecause they didn't believe us,
p151
aVand we thought that they were actually casting aspersions
p152
aVon the Barefoot architects of Tilonia.
p153
aa(lp154
VI asked a forester \u2014
p155
aVhigh-powered, paper-qualified expert \u2014
p156
aVI said, "What can you build in this place?"
p157
aVHe had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way.
p158
aVNot even worth it.
p159
aVNo water, rocky soil."
p160
aVI was in a bit of a spot.
p161
aVAnd I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village
p162
aVand say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'"
p163
aVHe looked quietly at me and said,
p164
aV"You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work."
p165
aVThis is what it looks like today.
p166
aa(lp167
VWent to the roof,
p168
aVand all the women said, "Clear out.
p169
aVThe men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men.
p170
aVThis is waterproofing the roof."
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aVIt is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens
p173
aVand a bit of other things I don't know.
p174
aVBut it actually doesn't leak.
p175
aVSince 1986, it hasn't leaked.
p176
aVThis technology, the women will not share with the men.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VIt's the only college
p181
aVwhich is fully solar-electrified.
p182
aVAll the power comes from the sun.
p183
aV45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.
p184
aVAnd everything works off the sun for the next 25 years.
p185
aVSo long as the sun shines,
p186
aVwe'll have no problem with power.
p187
aVBut the beauty is
p188
aVthat is was installed
p189
aVby a priest, a Hindu priest,
p190
aVwho's only done eight years of primary schooling \u2014
p191
aVnever been to school, never been to college.
p192
aVHe knows more about solar
p193
aVthan anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed.
p194
aa(lp195
VFood, if you come to the Barefoot College,
p196
aVis solar cooked.
p197
aVBut the people who fabricated that solar cooker
p198
aVare women,
p199
aVilliterate women,
p200
aVwho actually fabricate
p201
aVthe most sophisticated solar cooker.
p202
aVIt's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.
p203
aVUnfortunately, they're almost half German,
p204
aVthey're so precise.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVYou'll never find Indian women so precise.
p207
aVAbsolutely to the last inch,
p208
aVthey can make that cooker.
p209
aVAnd we have 60 meals twice a day
p210
aVof solar cooking.
p211
aa(lp212
VWe have a dentist \u2014
p213
aVshe's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.
p214
aVShe actually looks after the teeth
p215
aVof 7,000 children.
p216
aVBarefoot technology:
p217
aVthis was 1986 \u2014 no engineer, no architect thought of it \u2014
p218
aVbut we are collecting rainwater from the roofs.
p219
aVVery little water is wasted.
p220
aVAll the roofs are connected underground
p221
aVto a 400,000 liter tank,
p222
aVand no water is wasted.
p223
aVIf we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus,
p224
aVbecause we collect rainwater.
p225
aa(lp226
V60 percent of children don't go to school,
p227
aVbecause they have to look after animals \u2014
p228
aVsheep, goats \u2014
p229
aVdomestic chores.
p230
aVSo we thought of starting a school
p231
aVat night for the children.
p232
aVBecause the night schools of Tilonia,
p233
aVover 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.
p234
aVBecause it's for the convenience of the child;
p235
aVit's not for the convenience of the teacher.
p236
aVAnd what do we teach in these schools?
p237
aVDemocracy, citizenship,
p238
aVhow you should measure your land,
p239
aVwhat you should do if you're arrested,
p240
aVwhat you should do if your animal is sick.
p241
aVThis is what we teach in the night schools.
p242
aVBut all the schools are solar-lit.
p243
aa(lp244
VEvery five years
p245
aVwe have an election.
p246
aVBetween six to 14 year-old children
p247
aVparticipate in a democratic process,
p248
aVand they elect a prime minister.
p249
aVThe prime minister is 12 years old.
p250
aVShe looks after 20 goats in the morning,
p251
aVbut she's prime minister in the evening.
p252
aVShe has a cabinet,
p253
aVa minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.
p254
aVAnd they actually monitor and supervise
p255
aV150 schools for 7,000 children.
p256
aVShe got the World's Children's Prize five years ago,
p257
aVand she went to Sweden.
p258
aVFirst time ever going out of her village.
p259
aVNever seen Sweden.
p260
aVWasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.
p261
aVAnd the Queen of Sweden, who's there,
p262
aVturned to me and said, "Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from?
p263
aVShe's only 12 years old,
p264
aVand she's not dazzled by anything."
p265
aVAnd the girl, who's on her left,
p266
aVturned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye
p267
aVand said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister."
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
V(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VWhere the percentage of illiteracy is very high,
p274
aVwe use puppetry.
p275
aVPuppets is the way we communicate.
p276
aVYou have Jokhim Chacha
p277
aVwho is 300 years old.
p278
aVHe is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher.
p279
aVHe's my doctor. He's my lawyer.
p280
aVHe's my donor.
p281
aVHe actually raises money,
p282
aVsolves my disputes.
p283
aVHe solves my problems in the village.
p284
aVIf there's tension in the village,
p285
aVif attendance at the schools goes down
p286
aVand there's a friction between the teacher and the parent,
p287
aVthe puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village
p288
aVand says, "Shake hands.
p289
aVThe attendance must not drop."
p290
aVThese puppets
p291
aVare made out of recycled World Bank reports.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
V(Applause)
p296
aa(lp297
VSo this decentralized, demystified approach
p298
aVof solar-electrifying villages,
p299
aVwe've covered all over India
p300
aVfrom Ladakh up to Bhutan \u2014
p301
aVall solar-electrified villages
p302
aVby people who have been trained.
p303
aVAnd we went to Ladakh,
p304
aVand we asked this woman \u2014
p305
aVthis, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof,
p306
aVbecause there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides \u2014
p307
aVand we asked this woman,
p308
aV"What was the benefit you had
p309
aVfrom solar electricity?"
p310
aVAnd she thought for a minute and said,
p311
aV"It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."
p312
aa(lp313
V(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VWent to Afghanistan.
p316
aVOne lesson we learned in India
p317
aVwas men are untrainable.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVMen are restless,
p320
aVmen are ambitious,
p321
aVmen are compulsively mobile,
p322
aVand they all want a certificate.
p323
aV(Laughter)
p324
aVAll across the globe, you have this tendency
p325
aVof men wanting a certificate.
p326
aVWhy? Because they want to leave the village
p327
aVand go to a city, looking for a job.
p328
aVSo we came up with a great solution:
p329
aVtrain grandmothers.
p330
aVWhat's the best way of communicating
p331
aVin the world today?
p332
aVTelevision? No.
p333
aVTelegraph? No.
p334
aVTelephone? No.
p335
aVTell a woman.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
V(Applause)
p340
aa(lp341
VSo we went to Afghanistan for the first time,
p342
aVand we picked three women
p343
aVand said, "We want to take them to India."
p344
aVThey said, "Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms,
p345
aVand you want to take them to India."
p346
aVI said, "I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well."
p347
aVSo I took the husbands along.
p348
aVOf course, the women were much more intelligent than the men.
p349
aVIn six months,
p350
aVhow do we train these women?
p351
aVSign language.
p352
aVYou don't choose the written word.
p353
aVYou don't choose the spoken word.
p354
aVYou use sign language.
p355
aVAnd in six months
p356
aVthey can become solar engineers.
p357
aVThey go back and solar-electrify their own village.
p358
aa(lp359
VThis woman went back
p360
aVand solar-electrified the first village,
p361
aVset up a workshop \u2014
p362
aVthe first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan
p363
aV[was] by the three women.
p364
aVThis woman
p365
aVis an extraordinary grandmother.
p366
aV55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan.
p367
aVAnd they haven't collapsed.
p368
aVShe actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan
p369
aVand told the head of the department
p370
aVthe difference between AC and DC.
p371
aVHe didn't know.
p372
aVThose three women have trained 27 more women
p373
aVand solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan.
p374
aa(lp375
VWe went to Africa,
p376
aVand we did the same thing.
p377
aVAll these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries,
p378
aVall chatting to each other, not understanding a word,
p379
aVbecause they're all speaking a different language.
p380
aVBut their body language is great.
p381
aVThey're speaking to each other
p382
aVand actually becoming solar engineers.
p383
aVI went to Sierra Leone,
p384
aVand there was this minister driving down in the dead of night \u2014
p385
aVcomes across this village.
p386
aVComes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?"
p387
aVThey said, "These two grandmothers ... "
p388
aV"Grandmothers?" The minister couldn't believe what was happening.
p389
aV"Where did they go?" "Went to India and back."
p390
aVWent straight to the president.
p391
aVHe said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"
p392
aVHe said, "No." Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.
p393
aV"What's the story."
p394
aVSo he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"
p395
aVI said, "I can't, Mr. President.
p396
aVBut they will. The grandmothers will."
p397
aVSo he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone.
p398
aVAnd 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone.
p399
aa(lp400
VGambia:
p401
aVwe went to select a grandmother in Gambia.
p402
aVWent to this village.
p403
aVI knew which woman I would like to take.
p404
aVThe community got together and said, "Take these two women."
p405
aVI said, "No, I want to take this woman."
p406
aVThey said, "Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her."
p407
aVI said, "I like the body language. I like the way she speaks."
p408
aV"Difficult husband; not possible."
p409
aVCalled the husband, the husband came,
p410
aVswaggering, politician, mobile in his hand. "Not possible."
p411
aV"Why not?" "The woman, look how beautiful she is."
p412
aVI said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful."
p413
aV"What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?"
p414
aVThat was his biggest fear.
p415
aVI said, "She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile."
p416
aVShe went like a grandmother
p417
aVand came back like a tiger.
p418
aVShe walked out of the plane
p419
aVand spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.
p420
aVShe handled the national press,
p421
aVand she was a star.
p422
aVAnd when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"
p423
aV"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter."
p424
aV(Laughter)
p425
aVSuccess story.
p426
aa(lp427
V(Laughter)
p428
aa(lp429
V(Applause)
p430
aa(lp431
VI'll just wind up by saying
p432
aVthat I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.
p433
aVLook for solutions within.
p434
aVAnd listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you.
p435
aVThey're all over the world.
p436
aVDon't even worry.
p437
aVDon't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.
p438
aVThey have all the solutions in the world.
p439
aa(lp440
VI'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.
p441
aV"First they ignore you,
p442
aVthen they laugh at you,
p443
aVthen they fight you,
p444
aVand then you win."
p445
aa(lp446
VThank you.

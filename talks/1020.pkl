VRestaurants and the food industry in general
p5
aVare pretty much the most wasteful industry
p6
aVin the world.
p7
aVFor every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today,
p8
aV10 calories are taken to produce it.
p9
aVThat's a lot.
p10
aVI want to take something rather humble
p11
aVto discuss.
p12
aVI found this in the farmers' market today,
p13
aVand if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.
p14
aVThe humble potato \u2014
p15
aVand I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.
p16
aVAnd it pretty much goes through
p17
aVeight different forms in its lifetime.
p18
aVFirst of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.
p19
aVIt grows and is nurtured.
p20
aVIt's then harvested.
p21
aVIt's then distributed,
p22
aVand distribution is a massive issue.
p23
aVIt's then sold and bought,
p24
aVand it's then delivered to me.
p25
aVI basically take it, prepare it,
p26
aVand then people consume it \u2014 hopefully they enjoy it.
p27
aVThe last stage is basically waste,
p28
aVand this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it.
p29
aVThere are different types of waste.
p30
aVThere's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy;
p31
aVand there's a waste of waste.
p32
aVAnd every business I've been working on
p33
aVover the past five years,
p34
aVI'm trying to lower each one of these elements.
p35
aa(lp36
VOkay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like.
p37
aVBasically a restaurant just like any other.
p38
aVThis is the restaurant, Acorn House.
p39
aVFront and back.
p40
aVSo let me run you through a few ideas.
p41
aVFloor: sustainable, recyclable.
p42
aVChairs: recycled and recyclable.
p43
aVTables: Forestry Commission.
p44
aVThis is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.
p45
aVThis bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom \u2014
p46
aVshe didn't like sitting on it,
p47
aVso she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale \u2014
p48
aVreusing, a job that was pretty good.
p49
aVI hate waste, especially walls.
p50
aVIf they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did,
p51
aVand that shows all the customers my products.
p52
aVThe whole business is run on sustainable energy.
p53
aVThis is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs.
p54
aVPaint is all low-volume chemical,
p55
aVwhich is very important when you're working in the room all the time.
p56
aVI was experimenting with these \u2014 I don't know if you can see it \u2014
p57
aVbut there's a work surface there.
p58
aVAnd that's a plastic polymer.
p59
aVAnd I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.
p60
aVBut I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,
p61
aVexperiment with polymers.
p62
aVWill they outlive me? They probably might.
p63
aVRight, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.
p64
aVIt actually looks better than a brand new one \u2014 so looking good there.
p65
aVNow reusing is vital.
p66
aVAnd we filter our own water.
p67
aVWe put them in bottles, refrigerate them,
p68
aVand then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.
p69
aVHere's a great little example.
p70
aVIf you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,
p71
aVwhich has been turned inside out and sewn up.
p72
aVIt's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.
p73
aa(lp74
VThis is the kitchen, which is in the same room.
p75
aVI basically created a menu that allowed people
p76
aVto choose the amount and volume of food
p77
aVthat they wanted to consume.
p78
aVRather than me putting a dish down,
p79
aVthey were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.
p80
aVOkay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.
p81
aVIt serves 220 people a day.
p82
aVWe generate quite a lot of waste.
p83
aVThis is the waste room.
p84
aVYou can't get rid of waste.
p85
aVBut this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.
p86
aVIn here, I have produce and boxes
p87
aVthat are unavoidable.
p88
aVI put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator \u2014
p89
aVturns food into an inner material,
p90
aVwhich I can store and then compost later.
p91
aa(lp92
VI compost it in this garden.
p93
aVAll of the soil you can see there is basically my food,
p94
aVwhich is generated by the restaurant,
p95
aVand it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees
p96
aVand wine casks and all kinds of things.
p97
aVThree compost bins \u2014
p98
aVgo through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week \u2014
p99
aVreally good, makes fantastic compost.
p100
aVA couple of wormeries in there too.
p101
aVAnd actually one of the wormeries
p102
aVwas a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.
p103
aVAnd I tried taking the dried food waste,
p104
aVputting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner."
p105
aVIt was like vegetable jerky,
p106
aVand killed all of them.
p107
aVI don't know how many worms [were] in there,
p108
aVbut I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aVWhat you're seeing here is a water filtration system.
p111
aVThis takes the water out of the restaurant,
p112
aVruns it through these stone beds \u2014 this is going to be mint in there \u2014
p113
aVand I sort of water the garden with it.
p114
aVAnd I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,
p115
aVmaybe wash hands with it, I don't know.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo, water is a very important aspect.
p118
aVI started meditating on that
p119
aVand created a restaurant called Waterhouse.
p120
aVIf I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant
p121
aVthat is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.
p122
aVI managed to do it.
p123
aVThis restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House \u2014
p124
aVsame chairs, same tables.
p125
aVThey're all English and a little bit more sustainable.
p126
aVBut this is an electrical restaurant.
p127
aVThe whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.
p128
aVAnd it's run on hydroelectricity,
p129
aVso I've gone from air to water.
p130
aVNow it's important to understand
p131
aVthat this room
p132
aVis cooled by water, heated by water,
p133
aVfilters its own water,
p134
aVand it's powered by water.
p135
aVIt literally is Waterhouse.
p136
aVThe air handling system inside it \u2014
p137
aVI got rid of air-conditioning
p138
aVbecause I thought there was too much consumption going on there.
p139
aVThis is basically air-handling.
p140
aVI'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,
p141
aVpumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,
p142
aVit's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,
p143
aVand that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,
p144
aVcooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.
p145
aVAnd this is an English willow air diffuser,
p146
aVand that's softly moving
p147
aVthat air current through the room.
p148
aVVery advanced, no air-conditioning \u2014 I love it.
p149
aVIn the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,
p150
aVthere is hundreds of meters of coil piping.
p151
aVThis takes the temperature of the canal
p152
aVand turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.
p153
aVI have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVAnd what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant
p156
aVlives on this boat \u2014 it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.
p157
aVHe's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.
p158
aa(lp159
VThere's no accident in names of these restaurants.
p160
aVAcorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;
p161
aVand I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making
p162
aVfive restaurants based
p163
aVon the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.
p164
aVI've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.
p165
aVI've got metal and earth to come.
p166
aVSo you've got to watch your space for that.
p167
aVOkay. So this is my next project.
p168
aVFive weeks old,
p169
aVit's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.
p170
aVThe People's Supermarket.
p171
aVSo basically, the restaurants only really hit
p172
aVpeople who believed in what I was doing anyway.
p173
aVWhat I needed to do was get food out
p174
aVto a broader spectrum of people.
p175
aVSo people \u2014 i.e., perhaps, more working-class \u2014
p176
aVor perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.
p177
aVThis is a social enterprise,
p178
aVnot-for-profit cooperative supermarket.
p179
aVIt really is about the social disconnect
p180
aVbetween food, communities
p181
aVin urban settings
p182
aVand their relationship to rural growers \u2014
p183
aVconnecting communities in London to rural growers.
p184
aVReally important.
p185
aVSo I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;
p186
aVI'm committing to leeks and broccoli \u2014 all very important stuff.
p187
aVI've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;
p188
aVI've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;
p189
aVI've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.
p190
aVI mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.
p191
aVIn fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this
p192
aVthe most sustainable supermarket in the world.
p193
aVThat's zero food waste.
p194
aVAnd no one's doing that just yet.
p195
aVIn fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,
p196
aVlet's have a go. Try it on.
p197
aVI'm going to get there before you.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo nature doesn't create waste
p200
aVdoesn't create waste as such.
p201
aVEverything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle
p202
aVwith waste being the end of the beginning,
p203
aVand that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,
p204
aVand it's an important statement to understand.
p205
aVIf we don't stand up
p206
aVand make a difference
p207
aVand think about sustainable food,
p208
aVthink about the sustainable nature of it,
p209
aVthen we may fail.
p210
aVBut, I wanted to get up and show you
p211
aVthat we can do it if we're more responsible.
p212
aVEnvironmentally conscious businesses are doable.
p213
aVThey're here. You can see I've done three so far;
p214
aVI've got a few more to go.
p215
aVThe idea is embryonic.
p216
aVI think it's important.
p217
aVI think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse
p218
aVand recycle \u2014 right at the end there \u2014
p219
aVrecycling is the last point I want to make;
p220
aVbut it's the four R's, rather than the three R's \u2014
p221
aVthen I think we're going to be on our way.
p222
aVSo these three are not perfect \u2014 they're ideas.
p223
aVI think that there are many problems to come,
p224
aVbut with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.
p225
aVAnd I hope you all take part.
p226
aa(lp227
VThank you very much. (Applause)

For 23 years, Arthur Potts Dawson has worked alongside Britain&#39;s most respected chefs, including Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Jamie Oliver. But his interest in food began during childhood, on a Dorset farm. &quot;There was never much money around when I was growing up,&quot; he says. &quot;We learned to turn lights off, put a jumper on instead of the heating.&quot; </p><p>This thrifty sensibility found expression in his acclaimed London restaurants Acorn House and Water House, opened in 2006. From rooftop gardens to low-energy refrigerators and wormeries that turn food waste into compost, these restaurants prove the profitability of an eco-friendly approach -- and serve as training grounds for the next generation of green chefs. Potts Dawson is now taking his crusade to kitchen tables, launching The People&#39;s Supermarket, a member-run cooperative supporting British farms, and cooking for Mrs Paisley&#39;s Lashings, a supper club whose profits fund urban gardens in London schools.</p>", "slug": "arthur_potts_dawson", "whotheyare": "Arthur Potts Dawson wants us to take responsibility not just for the food we eat, but how we shop for and even dispose of it.

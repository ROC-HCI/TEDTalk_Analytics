VThe story starts: I was at a friend's house,
p5
aVand she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual,
p6
aVwhich is the manual of mental disorders.
p7
aVIt lists every known mental disorder.
p8
aVAnd it used to be, back in the '50s, a very slim pamphlet.
p9
aVAnd then it got bigger and bigger and bigger,
p10
aVand now it's 886 pages long.
p11
aVAnd it lists currently 374 mental disorders.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo I was leafing through it,
p14
aVwondering if I had any mental disorders,
p15
aVand it turns out I've got 12.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VI've got generalized anxiety disorder,
p20
aVwhich is a given.
p21
aVI've got nightmare disorder,
p22
aVwhich is categorized
p23
aVif you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure,
p24
aVand all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street
p25
aVgoing, "You're a failure!"
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VI've got parent-child relational problems,
p30
aVwhich I blame my parents for.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VI'm kidding. I'm not kidding.
p35
aVI'm kidding.
p36
aVAnd I've got malingering.
p37
aVAnd I think it's actually quite rare
p38
aVto have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder,
p39
aVbecause malingering tends to make me feel very anxious.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnyway, I was looking through this book,
p42
aVwondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was,
p43
aVor maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder
p44
aVif you're not a trained professional,
p45
aVor maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire
p46
aVto label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder.
p47
aVI didn't know which of these was true, but I thought it was kind of interesting,
p48
aVand I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry
p49
aVto get their view,
p50
aVwhich is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VIt was a man called Brian, who runs a crack team of Scientologists
p55
aVwho are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies.
p56
aVThey're called the CCHR.
p57
aVAnd I said to him, "Can you prove to me
p58
aVthat psychiatry is a pseudo-science that can't be trusted?"
p59
aVAnd he said, "Yes, we can prove it to you."
p60
aVAnd I said, "How?"
p61
aVAnd he said, "We're going to introduce you to Tony."
p62
aVAnd I said, "Who's Tony?"
p63
aVAnd he said, "Tony's in Broadmoor."
p64
aVNow, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.
p65
aVIt used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
p66
aVIt's where they send the serial killers,
p67
aVand the people who can't help themselves.
p68
aVAnd I said to Brian, "Well, what did Tony do?"
p69
aVAnd he said, "Hardly anything.
p70
aVHe beat someone up or something,
p71
aVand he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence.
p72
aVBut he faked it too well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor
p73
aVand nobody will believe he's sane.
p74
aVDo you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony?"
p75
aVSo I said, "Yes, please."
p76
aa(lp77
VSo I got the train to Broadmoor.
p78
aVI began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park,
p79
aVwhich apparently is what dogs also do when anxious,
p80
aVthey yawn uncontrollably.
p81
aVAnd we got to Broadmoor.
p82
aVAnd I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate
p83
aVinto the wellness center, which is where you get to meet the patients.
p84
aVIt looks like a giant Hampton Inn.
p85
aVIt's all peach and pine and calming colors.
p86
aVAnd the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons.
p87
aVAnd the patients started drifting in.
p88
aVAnd they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants,
p89
aVand quite docile-looking.
p90
aVAnd Brian the Scientologist whispered to me,
p91
aV"They're medicated,"
p92
aVwhich, to the Scientologists, is like the worst evil in the world,
p93
aVbut I'm thinking it's probably a good idea.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd then Brian said, "Here's Tony."
p98
aVAnd a man was walking in.
p99
aVAnd he wasn't overweight, he was in very good physical shape.
p100
aVAnd he wasn't wearing sweatpants,
p101
aVhe was wearing a pinstripe suit.
p102
aVAnd he had his arm outstretched
p103
aVlike someone out of The Apprentice.
p104
aVHe looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit
p105
aVthat would convince me that he was very sane.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd he sat down.
p108
aVAnd I said, "So is it true that you faked your way in here?"
p109
aVAnd he said, "Yep. Yep. Absolutely. I beat someone up when I was 17.
p110
aVAnd I was in prison awaiting trial,
p111
aVand my cellmate said to me,
p112
aV'You know what you have to do?
p113
aVFake madness.
p114
aVTell them you're mad, you'll get sent to some cushy hospital.
p115
aVNurses will bring you pizzas, you'll have your own PlayStation.'"
p116
aVI said, "Well, how did you do it?"
p117
aVHe said, "Well, I asked to see the prison psychiatrist.
p118
aVAnd I'd just seen a film called 'Crash,'
p119
aVin which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.
p120
aVSo I said to the psychiatrist,
p121
aV'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.'"
p122
aVAnd I said, "What else?"
p123
aVHe said, "Oh, yeah. I told the psychiatrist
p124
aVthat I wanted to watch women as they died,
p125
aVbecause it would make me feel more normal."
p126
aVI said, "Where'd you get that from?"
p127
aVHe said, "Oh, from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had
p128
aVat the prison library."
p129
aa(lp130
VAnyway, he faked madness too well, he said.
p131
aVAnd they didn't send him to some cushy hospital.
p132
aVThey sent him to Broadmoor.
p133
aVAnd the minute he got there,
p134
aVsaid he took one look at the place, asked to see the psychiatrist,
p135
aVsaid, "There's been a terrible misunderstanding.
p136
aVI'm not mentally ill."
p137
aVI said, "How long have you been here for?"
p138
aVHe said, "Well, if I'd just done my time in prison
p139
aVfor the original crime, I'd have got five years.
p140
aVI've been in Broadmoor for 12 years."
p141
aa(lp142
VTony said that it's a lot harder to convince people you're sane
p143
aVthan it is to convince them you're crazy.
p144
aVHe said, "I thought the best way to seem normal
p145
aVwould be to talk to people normally about normal things
p146
aVlike football or what's on TV.
p147
aVI subscribe to New Scientist,
p148
aVand recently they had an article
p149
aVabout how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives.
p150
aVSo I said to a nurse,
p151
aV'Did you know that the U.S. Army is training bumblebees
p152
aVto sniff out explosives?'
p153
aVWhen I read my medical notes, I saw they'd written:
p154
aV'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'"
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VHe said, "You know, they're always looking out for nonverbal clues
p159
aVto my mental state.
p160
aVBut how do you sit in a sane way?
p161
aVHow do you cross your legs in a sane way?
p162
aVIt's just impossible."
p163
aVWhen Tony said that to me,
p164
aVI thought to myself, "Am I sitting like a journalist?
p165
aVAm I crossing my legs like a journalist?"
p166
aa(lp167
VHe said, "You know, I've got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me,
p168
aVand I've got the 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' rapist
p169
aVon the other side of me.
p170
aVSo I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening.
p171
aVAnd they take that as a sign of madness.
p172
aVThey say it proves that I'm aloof and grandiose."
p173
aVSo, only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers
p174
aVbe a sign of madness.
p175
aVAnyway, he seemed completely normal to me, but what did I know?
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd when I got home I emailed his clinician, Anthony Maden.
p178
aVI said, "What's the story?"
p179
aVAnd he said, "Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness
p180
aVto get out of a prison sentence, because his hallucinations \u2014
p181
aVthat had seemed quite cliche to begin with \u2014
p182
aVjust vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor.
p183
aVHowever, we have assessed him,
p184
aVand we've determined that what he is
p185
aVis a psychopath."
p186
aVAnd in fact, faking madness
p187
aVis exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath.
p188
aVIt's on the checklist: cunning, manipulative.
p189
aVSo, faking your brain going wrong
p190
aVis evidence that your brain has gone wrong.
p191
aVAnd I spoke to other experts,
p192
aVand they said the pinstripe suit \u2014 classic psychopath \u2014
p193
aVspeaks to items one and two on the checklist:
p194
aVglibness, superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth.
p195
aVAnd I said, "Well, but why didn't he hang out with the other patients?"
p196
aVClassic psychopath \u2014 it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.
p197
aVSo all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony
p198
aVwas evidence, according to his clinician,
p199
aVthat he was mad in this new way.
p200
aVHe was a psychopath.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd his clinician said to me, "If you want to know more about psychopaths,
p203
aVyou can go on a psychopath-spotting course
p204
aVrun by Robert Hare, who invented the psychopath checklist."
p205
aVSo I did.
p206
aVI went on a psychopath-spotting course,
p207
aVand I am now a certified \u2014
p208
aVand I have to say, extremely adept \u2014 psychopath spotter.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo, here's the statistics:
p211
aVOne in a hundred regular people is a psychopath.
p212
aVSo there's 1,500 people in his room.
p213
aVFifteen of you are psychopaths.
p214
aVAlthough that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders,
p215
aVso I think there's a very good chance
p216
aVthere's about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room.
p217
aVIt could be carnage by the end of the night.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VHare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless
p222
aVrewards psychopathic behavior \u2014
p223
aVthe lack of empathy, the glibness,
p224
aVcunning, manipulative.
p225
aVIn fact, capitalism, perhaps at its most remorseless,
p226
aVis a physical manifestation of psychopathy.
p227
aVIt's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all.
p228
aVHare said, "You know what? Forget about some guy at Broadmoor
p229
aVwho may or may not have faked madness.
p230
aVWho cares? That's not a big story.
p231
aVThe big story," he said, "is corporate psychopathy.
p232
aVYou want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths."
p233
aa(lp234
VSo I gave it a try. I wrote to the Enron people.
p235
aVI said, "Could I come and interview you in prison,
p236
aVto find out it you're psychopaths?"
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd they didn't reply.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VSo I changed tack.
p245
aVI emailed "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap,
p246
aVthe asset stripper from the 1990s.
p247
aVHe would come into failing businesses
p248
aVand close down 30 percent of the workforce,
p249
aVjust turn American towns into ghost towns.
p250
aVAnd I emailed him and I said,
p251
aV"I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly
p252
aVthat makes you ... special,
p253
aVand interested in the predatory spirit, and fearless.
p254
aVCan I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly?"
p255
aVAnd he said, "Come on over!"
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VSo I went to Al Dunlap's grand Florida mansion.
p260
aVIt was filled with sculptures of predatory animals.
p261
aVThere were lions and tigers \u2014 he was taking me through the garden \u2014
p262
aVthere were falcons and eagles,
p263
aVhe was saying, "Over there you've got sharks and \u2014"
p264
aVhe was saying this in a less effeminate way \u2014
p265
aV"You've got more sharks and you've got tigers."
p266
aVIt was like Narnia.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd then we went into his kitchen.
p271
aVNow, Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies,
p272
aVhe'd close down 30 percent of the workforce.
p273
aVAnd he'd quite often fire people with a joke.
p274
aVLike, for instance, one famous story about him,
p275
aVsomebody came up to him and said, "I've just bought myself a new car."
p276
aVAnd he said, "Well, you may have a new car,
p277
aVbut I'll tell you what you don't have \u2014 a job."
p278
aa(lp279
VSo in his kitchen \u2014
p280
aVhe was in there with his wife, Judy, and his bodyguard, Sean \u2014
p281
aVand I said, "You know how I said in my email
p282
aVthat you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special?"
p283
aVHe said, "Yeah, it's an amazing theory, it's like Star Trek.
p284
aVYou're going where no man has gone before."
p285
aVAnd I said, "Well \u2014" (Clears throat)
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
VSome psychologists might say
p290
aVthat this makes you \u2014" (Mumbles)
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd he said, "What?"
p295
aVAnd I said, "A psychopath."
p296
aVAnd I said, "I've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket.
p297
aVCan I go through them with you?"
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd he looked intrigued despite himself,
p300
aVand he said, "Okay, go on."
p301
aVAnd I said, "Okay. Grandiose sense of self-worth."
p302
aVWhich I have to say, would have been hard for him to deny,
p303
aVbecause he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VHe said, "Well, you've got to believe in you!"
p308
aVAnd I said, "Manipulative."
p309
aVHe said, "That's leadership."
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd I said, "Shallow affect,
p314
aVan inability to experience a range of emotions."
p315
aVHe said, "Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions?"
p316
aVSo he was going down the psychopath checklist,
p317
aVbasically turning it into "Who Moved My Cheese?"
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VBut I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.
p322
aVWhenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal \u2014
p323
aVlike he said "no" to juvenile delinquency,
p324
aVhe said he got accepted into West Point,
p325
aVand they don't let delinquents in West Point.
p326
aVHe said "no" to many short-term marital relationships.
p327
aVHe's only ever been married twice.
p328
aVAdmittedly, his first wife cited in her divorce papers
p329
aVthat he once threatened her with a knife
p330
aVand said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like,
p331
aVbut people say stupid things to each other
p332
aVin bad marriages in the heat of an argument,
p333
aVand his second marriage has lasted 41 years.
p334
aVSo whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,
p335
aVI thought to myself, well I'm not going to put that in my book.
p336
aVAnd then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter
p337
aVhad kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic.
p338
aVBecause I was desperate to shove him in a box marked "Psychopath."
p339
aVI was desperate to define him by his maddest edges.
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd I realized, my God \u2014
p342
aVthis is what I've been doing for 20 years.
p343
aVIt's what all journalists do.
p344
aVWe travel across the world with our notepads in our hands,
p345
aVand we wait for the gems.
p346
aVAnd the gems are always the outermost aspects
p347
aVof our interviewee's personality.
p348
aVAnd we stitch them together like medieval monks,
p349
aVand we leave the normal stuff on the floor.
p350
aVAnd you know, this is a country that over-diagnoses
p351
aVcertain mental disorders hugely.
p352
aVChildhood bipolar \u2014
p353
aVchildren as young as four are being labeled bipolar
p354
aVbecause they have temper tantrums,
p355
aVwhich scores them high on the bipolar checklist.
p356
aa(lp357
VWhen I got back to London, Tony phoned me.
p358
aVHe said, "Why haven't you been returning my calls?"
p359
aVI said, "Well, they say that you're a psychopath."
p360
aVAnd he said, "I'm not a psychopath."
p361
aVHe said, "You know what?
p362
aVOne of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse,
p363
aVbut another item on the checklist is cunning, manipulative.
p364
aVSo when you say you feel remorse for your crime,
p365
aVthey say, 'Typical of the psychopath
p366
aVto cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn't.'
p367
aVIt's like witchcraft, they turn everything upside-down."
p368
aVHe said, "I've got a tribunal coming up.
p369
aVWill you come to it?"
p370
aVSo I said okay.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo I went to his tribunal.
p373
aVAnd after 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go.
p374
aVThey decided that he shouldn't be held indefinitely
p375
aVbecause he scores high on a checklist that might mean
p376
aVthat he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism.
p377
aVSo they let him go.
p378
aVAnd outside in the corridor he said to me,
p379
aV"You know what, Jon?
p380
aVEveryone's a bit psychopathic."
p381
aVHe said, "You are, I am. Well, obviously I am."
p382
aVI said, "What are you going to do now?"
p383
aVHe said, "I'm going to go to Belgium.
p384
aVThere's a woman there that I fancy.
p385
aVBut she's married, so I'm going to have to get her split up from her husband."
p386
aa(lp387
V(Laughter)
p388
aa(lp389
VAnyway, that was two years ago,
p390
aVand that's where my book ended.
p391
aVAnd for the last 20 months, everything was fine.
p392
aVNothing bad happened.
p393
aVHe was living with a girl outside London.
p394
aVHe was, according to Brian the Scientologist,
p395
aVmaking up for lost time, which I know sounds ominous,
p396
aVbut isn't necessarily ominous.
p397
aVUnfortunately, after 20 months,
p398
aVhe did go back to jail for a month.
p399
aVHe got into a "fracas" in a bar, he called it.
p400
aVEnded up going to jail for a month, which I know is bad,
p401
aVbut at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was,
p402
aVit wasn't too bad.
p403
aa(lp404
VAnd then he phoned me.
p405
aVAnd you know what, I think it's right that Tony is out.
p406
aVBecause you shouldn't define people by their maddest edges.
p407
aVAnd what Tony is, is he's a semi-psychopath.
p408
aVHe's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas.
p409
aVBut the gray areas are where you find the complexity.
p410
aVIt's where you find the humanity,
p411
aVand it's where you find the truth.
p412
aVAnd Tony said to me,
p413
aV"Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?
p414
aVI just want to thank you for everything you've done for me."
p415
aVAnd I didn't go.
p416
aVWhat would you have done?
p417
aa(lp418
VThank you.
p419
aa(lp420

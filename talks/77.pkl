VIf you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.
p5
aVAnd that's not a joke, we really do.
p6
aVSo come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp
p9
aVa few years ago because they make sound.
p10
aVThis is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp
p11
aVthat's found off the coast of California.
p12
aVAnd while that's an absolutely fascinating sound,
p13
aVit actually turns out to be a very difficult project.
p14
aVAnd while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp,
p15
aVor stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages.
p16
aVAnd mantis shrimp are called "mantis shrimp" after the praying mantises,
p17
aVwhich also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think,
p18
aVwell, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds,
p19
aVto figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.
p20
aVAnd so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike,
p21
aVwork that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, mantis shrimp come in two varieties:
p24
aVthere are spearers and smashers.
p25
aVAnd this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod.
p26
aVAnd he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.
p27
aVSo, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit,
p28
aVthis is the mantis shrimp \u2014 the same species \u2014
p29
aVrecorded at 1,000 frames a second,
p30
aVplayed back at 15 frames per second.
p31
aVAnd you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs,
p32
aVexploding upward to actually just catch
p33
aVa dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.
p34
aVNow, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod,
p35
aVand these guys open up snails for a living.
p36
aVAnd so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VSo, I'll play it one more time.
p41
aVHe wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.
p42
aVAnd a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner.
p43
aVSo, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end,
p44
aVor it can smash with the heel.
p45
aVAnd today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd so the first question that came to mind was,
p48
aVwell, how fast does this limb move?
p49
aVBecause it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.
p50
aVAnd I immediately came upon a problem.
p51
aVEvery single high-speed video system in the biology department
p52
aVat Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.
p53
aVWe simply couldn't capture it on video.
p54
aVAnd so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time.
p55
aVAnd then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department,
p56
aVlooking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.
p57
aVAnd so we struck up a deal.
p58
aVI said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system
p59
aVthat could capture these movements,
p60
aVyou guys can film us collecting the data."
p61
aVAnd believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter)
p62
aVSo we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology \u2014
p63
aVit just came out about a year ago \u2014
p64
aVthat allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.
p65
aVAnd low light is a critical issue with filming animals,
p66
aVbecause if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VSo this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here,
p69
aVand there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel.
p70
aVAnd that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.
p71
aVAnd the snail's wired to a stick,
p72
aVso he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And \u2014 yeah.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VI hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VSo this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second,
p81
aVand I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times.
p82
aVAnd as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast
p83
aVslowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement.
p84
aVThe whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards \u2014
p85
aVjust a spectacular movement.
p86
aVAnd so what we did is, we took a look at these videos,
p87
aVand we measured how fast the limb was moving
p88
aVto get back to that original question.
p89
aVAnd we were in for our first surprise.
p90
aVSo what we calculated was that the limbs were moving
p91
aVat the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second
p92
aVall the way up to 23 meters per second.
p93
aVAnd for those of you who prefer miles per hour,
p94
aVthat's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast.
p95
aVIn fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point
p96
aVon the extreme animal movement spectrum.
p97
aVAnd mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike
p98
aVof any animal system. So our first surprise.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Applause)
p101
aa(lp102
VSo that was really cool and very unexpected.
p103
aVSo, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?
p104
aVAnd actually, this work was done in the 1960s
p105
aVby a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.
p106
aVAnd what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use
p107
aVwhat's called a "catch mechanism," or "click mechanism."
p108
aVAnd what this basically consists of is a large muscle
p109
aVthat takes a good long time to contract,
p110
aVand a latch that prevents anything from moving.
p111
aVSo the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.
p112
aVAnd once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up \u2014
p113
aVthe latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.
p114
aVAnd that's basically what's called a "power amplification system."
p115
aVIt takes a long time for the muscle to contract,
p116
aVand a very short time for the limb to fly out.
p117
aVAnd so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.
p118
aVThis was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History.
p121
aVAnd if any of you ever have a chance,
p122
aVbackstage of the National Museum of Natural History
p123
aVis one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what \u2014
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
Vthis is serious business for me.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VSo, this \u2014 what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb,
p132
aVwhether it's a spearer or a smasher,
p133
aVis a beautiful saddle-shaped structure
p134
aVright on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.
p135
aVIt just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.
p136
aVIt's a very beautiful structure.
p137
aVAnd it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas
p138
aVsuggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.
p139
aVAnd this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.
p140
aVAnd then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show
p141
aVis that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.
p142
aVThere needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism
p143
aVin order to generate the amount of force that we observe,
p144
aVand the speed that we observe, and the output of the system.
p145
aVSo we thought, OK, this must be a spring \u2014
p146
aVthe saddle could very well be a spring.
p147
aVAnd we went back to those high-speed videos again,
p148
aVand we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending.
p149
aVAnd I'll just do that one more time.
p150
aVAnd then if you take a look at the video \u2014
p151
aVit's a little bit hard to see \u2014 it's outlined in yellow.
p152
aVThe saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it
p153
aVextending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending.
p154
aVSo, we've had very solid evidence showing
p155
aVthat that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends,
p156
aVand does, in fact, function as a spring.
p157
aa(lp158
VThe saddle-shaped structure is also known as a "hyperbolic paraboloid surface,"
p159
aVor an "anticlastic surface."
p160
aVAnd this is very well known to engineers and architects,
p161
aVbecause it's a very strong surface in compression.
p162
aVIt has curves in two directions,
p163
aVone curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other,
p164
aVso any kind of perturbation spreads the forces
p165
aVover the surface of this type of shape.
p166
aVSo it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.
p167
aVIt's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry,
p168
aVbecause it requires very little material
p169
aVto build this type of surface, and it's very strong.
p170
aVSo if you're going to build a thin gold structure,
p171
aVit's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects
p174
aVis Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure.
p175
aVAnd what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built
p176
aVthat's 87 and a half feet spanwise.
p177
aVIt's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points.
p178
aVAnd one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's \u2014
p179
aVhe found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure
p180
aVthat's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.
p181
aVAnd all of these are the same principles that apply
p182
aVto the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.
p183
aVIn biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot
p184
aVof extra material requirements for building it.
p185
aVSo, very interesting parallels between the biological
p186
aVand the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out \u2014
p187
aVthe stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first
p188
aVdescribed biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.
p189
aVThat's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo the next and final question was, well, how much force
p192
aVdoes a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?
p193
aVAnd so I wired up what's called a load cell.
p194
aVA load cell measures forces, and this is actually
p195
aVa piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.
p196
aVAnd when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change
p197
aVand it \u2014 which \u2014 in proportion to the forces that go in.
p198
aVSo these animals are wonderfully aggressive,
p199
aVand are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do
p200
aVwas actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell,
p201
aVand they'd smash away at it.
p202
aVAnd so this is just a regular video of the animal
p203
aVjust smashing the heck out of this load cell.
p204
aVAnd we were able to get some force measurements out.
p205
aVAnd again, we were in for a surprise.
p206
aa(lp207
VI purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking,
p208
aVno animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.
p209
aVAnd what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell.
p210
aVSo these are actually some old data
p211
aVwhere I had to find the smallest animals in the lab,
p212
aVand we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds
p213
aVgenerated by an animal about this big.
p214
aVAnd actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell
p215
aVup and running, and I've clocked these animals generating
p216
aVwell over 200 pounds of force.
p217
aVAnd again, I think this will be a world record.
p218
aVI have to do a little bit more background reading,
p219
aVbut I think this will be the largest amount of force produced
p220
aVby an animal of a given \u2014 per body mass. So, really incredible forces.
p221
aVAnd again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring
p222
aVin storing up and releasing so much energy in this system.
p223
aVBut that was not the end of the story.
p224
aa(lp225
VNow, things \u2014 I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work.
p226
aVAnd I got all these force measurements,
p227
aVand then I went and looked at the force output of the system.
p228
aVAnd this is just very simple \u2014 time is on the X-axis
p229
aVand the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.
p230
aVAnd that was what really got me puzzled.
p231
aVThe first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell.
p232
aVBut there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later,
p233
aVand I didn't know what that was.
p234
aVSo now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons,
p235
aVbut not half a millisecond later.
p236
aVAgain, going back to those high-speed videos,
p237
aVthere's a pretty good hint of what might be going on.
p238
aVHere's that same orientation that we saw earlier.
p239
aVThere's that raptorial appendage \u2014 there's the heel,
p240
aVand it's going to swing around and hit the load cell.
p241
aVAnd what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this,
p242
aVon the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through.
p243
aVAnd I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.
p244
aa(lp245
VAudience: Wow.
p246
aa(lp247
VSheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there
p248
aVat the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble.
p249
aVAnd what that is, is cavitation.
p250
aVAnd cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon
p251
aVwhich occurs when you have areas of water
p252
aVmoving at extremely different speeds.
p253
aVAnd when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure,
p254
aVwhich results in the water literally vaporizing.
p255
aVAnd when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat,
p256
aVand it's a very destructive process.
p257
aVAnd so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation
p258
aVwhere engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon,
p259
aVbecause it destroys boat propellers.
p260
aVPeople have been struggling for years to try and design
p261
aVa very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate
p262
aVand literally wear away the metal and put holes in it,
p263
aVjust like these pictures show.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further,
p266
aVI'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.
p267
aVThis is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give
p268
aVfull credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up,
p269
aVbecause I could never have done this in a million years \u2014
p270
aVone of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.
p271
aVYou can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light,
p272
aVand all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.
p273
aVSo really, just an amazing image,
p274
aVslowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds.
p275
aVAnd again, we can see it in slightly different form there,
p276
aVwith the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces.
p277
aVIn fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo to solve this quandary of the two force peaks:
p280
aVwhat I think was going on is: that first impact is actually
p281
aVthe limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually
p282
aVthe collapse of the cavitation bubble.
p283
aVAnd these animals may very well be making use of
p284
aVnot only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring,
p285
aVbut the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be
p286
aVmaking use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.
p287
aVSo, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo, one question I often get after this talk \u2014
p290
aVso I figured I'd answer it now \u2014 is, well, what happens to the animal?
p291
aVBecause obviously, if it's breaking snails,
p292
aVthe poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.
p293
aVThat's the smashing part of the heel on both these images,
p294
aVand it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away
p295
aVtheir heel all the way to the flesh.
p296
aVBut one of the convenient things about being an arthropod
p297
aVis that you have to molt. And every three months or so
p298
aVthese animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem.
p299
aVVery, very convenient solution to that particular problem.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VMaybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VSo, the saddles \u2014 that saddle-shaped spring \u2014
p310
aVhas actually been well known to biologists for a long time,
p311
aVnot as a spring but as a visual signal.
p312
aVAnd there's actually a spectacular colored dot
p313
aVin the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods.
p314
aVAnd this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins
p315
aVof visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.
p316
aVAnd I think one explanation for this could be
p317
aVgoing back to the molting phenomenon.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo these animals go into a molting period where they're
p320
aVunable to strike \u2014 their bodies become very soft.
p321
aVAnd they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.
p322
aVThis is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period
p323
aVwhen they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful,
p324
aVand they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.
p325
aVAnd the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more,
p326
aVthey just signal. They wave their legs around.
p327
aVAnd it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.
p328
aVIt's a well-established fact of these animals
p329
aVthat they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.
p330
aVAnd so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots
p331
aVin the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information
p332
aVabout their ability to strike, or their strike force,
p333
aVand something about the time period in the molting cycle.
p334
aVSo sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure
p335
aVright in the middle of their spring.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators,
p338
aVWyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this.
p339
aVAnd also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science,
p340
aVwhich gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time,
p341
aVand for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much.

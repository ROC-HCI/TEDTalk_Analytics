VI would like to share with you this morning
p5
aVsome stories about the ocean
p6
aVthrough my work as a still photographer
p7
aVfor National Geographic magazine.
p8
aVI guess I became an underwater photographer
p9
aVand a photojournalist
p10
aVbecause I fell in love with the sea as a child.
p11
aVAnd I wanted to tell stories
p12
aVabout all the amazing things I was seeing underwater,
p13
aVincredible wildlife and interesting behaviors.
p14
aVAnd after even 30 years of doing this,
p15
aVafter 30 years of exploring the ocean,
p16
aVI never cease to be amazed
p17
aVat the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea.
p18
aVBut more and more frequently these days
p19
aVI'm seeing terrible things underwater as well,
p20
aVthings that I don't think most people realize.
p21
aVAnd I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues
p22
aVto tell a more complete story.
p23
aVI want people to see what's happening underwater,
p24
aVboth the horror and the magic.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe first story that I did for National Geographic,
p27
aVwhere I recognized the ability to include
p28
aVenvironmental issues within a natural history coverage,
p29
aVwas a story I proposed on harp seals.
p30
aVThe story I wanted to do initially
p31
aVwas just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year
p32
aVwhere these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic
p33
aVto the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada
p34
aVto engage in courtship, mating and to have their pups.
p35
aVAnd all of this is played out against
p36
aVthe backdrop of transient pack ice
p37
aVthat moves with wind and tide.
p38
aVAnd because I'm an underwater photographer,
p39
aVI wanted to do this story from both above and below,
p40
aVto make pictures like this that show one of these little pups
p41
aVmaking its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water.
p42
aVBut as I got more involved in the story,
p43
aVI realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore.
p44
aVThe first was that these animals continue to be hunted,
p45
aVkilled with hakapiks at about eight, 15 days old.
p46
aVIt actually is the largest marine mammal
p47
aVslaughter on the planet,
p48
aVwith hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut as disturbing as that is,
p51
aVI think the bigger problem for harp seals
p52
aVis the loss of sea ice due to global warming.
p53
aVThis is an aerial picture that I made that shows
p54
aVthe Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season.
p55
aVAnd even though we see a lot of ice in this picture,
p56
aVthere's a lot of water as well, which wasn't there historically.
p57
aVAnd the ice that is there is quite thin.
p58
aVThe problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice
p59
aVin order to nurse from their moms.
p60
aVThey only need 12 days from the moment they're born until they're on their own.
p61
aVBut if they don't get 12 days,
p62
aVthey can fall into the ocean and die.
p63
aVThis is a photo that I made showing
p64
aVone of these pups that's only about five or seven days old \u2014
p65
aVstill has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly \u2014
p66
aVthat has fallen in because of the thin ice,
p67
aVand the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe
p68
aVand to get it back to stable purchase.
p69
aVThis problem has continued to grow each year since I was there.
p70
aVI read that last year the pup mortality rate
p71
aVwas 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
p72
aVSo, clearly, this species has a lot of problems going forward.
p73
aVThis ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic.
p74
aVAnd it received quite a bit of attention.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd with that, I saw the potential to begin
p77
aVdoing other stories about ocean problems.
p78
aVSo I proposed a story on the global fish crisis,
p79
aVin part because I had personally witnessed
p80
aVa lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years,
p81
aVbut also because I read a scientific paper
p82
aVthat stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean
p83
aVhave disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years.
p84
aVThese are the tuna, the billfish and the sharks.
p85
aVWhen I read that, I was blown away by those numbers.
p86
aVI thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet,
p87
aVbut it really wasn't, so I wanted to do a story
p88
aVthat was a very different kind of underwater story.
p89
aVI wanted it to be more like war photography,
p90
aVwhere I was making harder-hitting pictures
p91
aVthat showed readers what was happening
p92
aVto marine wildlife around the planet.
p93
aa(lp94
VThe first component of the story that I thought was essential, however,
p95
aVwas to give readers a sense of appreciation
p96
aVfor the ocean animals that they were eating.
p97
aVYou know, I think people go into a restaurant,
p98
aVand somebody orders a steak, and we all know where steak comes from,
p99
aVand somebody orders a chicken, and we know what a chicken is,
p100
aVbut when they're eating bluefin sushi,
p101
aVdo they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming?
p102
aVThese are the lions and tigers of the sea.
p103
aVIn reality, these animals have no terrestrial counterpart;
p104
aVthey're unique in the world.
p105
aVThese are animals that can practically swim
p106
aVfrom the equator to the poles
p107
aVand can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year.
p108
aVIf we weren't so efficient at catching them, because they grow their entire life,
p109
aVwould have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton.
p110
aVBut the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them,
p111
aVand their stocks have collapsed worldwide.
p112
aa(lp113
VThis is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market
p114
aVthat I photographed a couple years ago.
p115
aVAnd every single day these tuna, bluefin like this,
p116
aVare stacked up like cordwood,
p117
aVjust warehouse after warehouse.
p118
aVAs I wandered around and made these pictures,
p119
aVit sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store, you know.
p120
aVWe can't keep taking without expecting
p121
aVserious consequences as a result.
p122
aa(lp123
VI also, with the story, wanted to show readers
p124
aVhow fish are caught, some of the methods that are used to catch fish,
p125
aVlike a bottom trawler, which is one of the most common methods in the world.
p126
aVThis was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp,
p127
aVbut the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world.
p128
aVYou have a large net in the middle
p129
aVwith two steel doors on either end.
p130
aVAnd as this assembly is towed through the water,
p131
aVthe doors meet resistance with the ocean,
p132
aVand it opens the mouth of the net,
p133
aVand they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom.
p134
aVAnd this just drags over the bottom, in this case to catch shrimp.
p135
aVBut as you can imagine, it's catching everything else in its path as well.
p136
aVAnd it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom,
p137
aVthings like sponges and corals,
p138
aVthat critical habitat for other animals.
p139
aa(lp140
VThis photograph I made of the fisherman
p141
aVholding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour.
p142
aVSo he had a handful of shrimp, maybe seven or eight shrimp,
p143
aVand all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch.
p144
aVThese are animals that died in the process,
p145
aVbut have no commercial value.
p146
aVSo this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner,
p147
aVmaybe seven or eight shrimp
p148
aVand 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process.
p149
aVAnd to make that point even more visual, I swam under the shrimp boat
p150
aVand made this picture of the guy shoveling
p151
aVthis bycatch into the sea as trash
p152
aVand photographed this cascade of death,
p153
aVyou know, animals like guitarfish, bat rays,
p154
aVflounder, pufferfish, that only an hour before,
p155
aVwere on the bottom of the ocean, alive,
p156
aVbut now being thrown back as trash.
p157
aa(lp158
VI also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry
p159
aVbecause, currently on planet Earth,
p160
aVwe're killing over 100 million sharks
p161
aVevery single year.
p162
aVBut before I went out to photograph this component,
p163
aVI sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark
p164
aVthat will resonate with readers
p165
aVYou know, I think there's still a lot of people out there who think
p166
aVthe only good shark is a dead shark.
p167
aVBut this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher
p168
aVthat had just recently died in the gill net.
p169
aVAnd with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible,
p170
aVit struck me as sort of a crucifixion, if you will.
p171
aVThis ended up being the lead picture
p172
aVin the global fishery story in National Geographic.
p173
aVAnd I hope that it helped readers to take notice
p174
aVof this problem of 100 million sharks.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd because I love sharks \u2014 I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks \u2014
p177
aVI wanted to do another, more celebratory, story about sharks,
p178
aVas a way of talking about the need for shark conservation.
p179
aVSo I went to the Bahamas
p180
aVbecause there're very few places in the world
p181
aVwhere sharks are doing well these days,
p182
aVbut the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy,
p183
aVlargely due to the fact that the government there
p184
aVhad outlawed longlining several years ago.
p185
aVAnd I wanted to show several species
p186
aVthat we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations.
p187
aa(lp188
VOne of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach,
p189
aVin the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks
p190
aVaggregate in shallow water.
p191
aVThis is a low-altitude photograph that I made
p192
aVshowing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks
p193
aVsort of just swimming around behind.
p194
aVBut the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage
p195
aVwas to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters.
p196
aVI didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary.
p197
aVAnd with this photograph of a beautiful
p198
aV15-feet, probably 14-feet, I guess,
p199
aVfemale tiger shark,
p200
aVI sort of think I got to that goal,
p201
aVwhere she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose,
p202
aVand my strobe created a shadow on her face.
p203
aVAnd I think it's a gentler picture, a little less threatening,
p204
aVa little more respectful of the species.
p205
aa(lp206
VI also searched on this story
p207
aVfor the elusive great hammerhead,
p208
aVan animal that really hadn't been photographed much
p209
aVuntil maybe about seven or 10 years ago.
p210
aVIt's a very solitary creature.
p211
aVBut this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science
p212
aVin both Florida and in the Bahamas.
p213
aVYou know, we know almost nothing about them.
p214
aVWe don't know where they migrate to or from,
p215
aVwhere they mate, where they have their pups,
p216
aVand yet, hammerhead populations in the Atlantic
p217
aVhave declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years.
p218
aVYou know, we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them.
p219
aa(lp220
VThis is the oceanic whitetip shark,
p221
aVan animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species,
p222
aVif you pay attention to such lists.
p223
aVBut it's an animal that's about 98 percent in decline
p224
aVthroughout most of its range.
p225
aVBecause this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water,
p226
aVand because we weren't working on the bottom,
p227
aVI brought along a shark cage here,
p228
aVand my friend, shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage.
p229
aVYou'll see that the photographer, of course, was not inside the cage here,
p230
aVso clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd lastly with this story,
p233
aVI also wanted to focus on baby sharks, shark nurseries.
p234
aVAnd I went to the island of Bimini, in the Bahamas,
p235
aVto work with lemon shark pups.
p236
aVThis is a photo of a lemon shark pup,
p237
aVand it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives
p238
aVin these protective mangroves.
p239
aVThis is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph.
p240
aVIt's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture.
p241
aVBut, you know, here we see a shark that's maybe 10 or 11 inches long
p242
aVswimming in about a foot of water.
p243
aVBut this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two, three years of their lives,
p244
aVuntil they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef.
p245
aVAfter I left Bimini, I actually learned
p246
aVthat this habitat was being bulldozed
p247
aVto create a new golf course and resort.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd other recent stories have looked at
p250
aVsingle, flagship species, if you will,
p251
aVthat are at risk in the ocean
p252
aVas a way of talking about other threats.
p253
aVOne such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle.
p254
aVThis is the largest, widest-ranging,
p255
aVdeepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species.
p256
aVHere we see a female crawling
p257
aVout of the ocean under moonlight
p258
aVon the island of Trinidad.
p259
aVThese are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years.
p260
aVAnd there was a time in their lifespan
p261
aVwhere they were coming out of the water to nest
p262
aVand saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by.
p263
aVAnd today, they crawl out and see condominiums.
p264
aVBut despite this amazing longevity,
p265
aVthey're now considered critically endangered.
p266
aVIn the Pacific, where I made this photograph,
p267
aVtheir stocks have declined about 90 percent
p268
aVin the last 15 years.
p269
aa(lp270
VThis is a photograph that shows a hatchling
p271
aVabout to taste saltwater for the very first time
p272
aVbeginning this long and perilous journey.
p273
aVOnly one in a thousand
p274
aVleatherback hatchlings will reach maturity.
p275
aVBut that's due to natural predators
p276
aVlike vultures that pick them off on a beach
p277
aVor predatory fish that are waiting offshore.
p278
aVNature has learned to compensate with that,
p279
aVand females have multiple clutches of eggs
p280
aVto overcome those odds.
p281
aVBut what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses,
p282
aVhuman things, like this picture that shows
p283
aVa leatherback caught at night in a gill net.
p284
aVI actually jumped in and photographed this,
p285
aVand with the fisherman's permission,
p286
aVI cut the turtle out, and it was able to swim free.
p287
aVBut, you know, thousands of other leatherbacks each year
p288
aVare not so fortunate,
p289
aVand the species' future is in great danger.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnother charismatic megafauna species that I worked with
p292
aVis the story I did on the right whale.
p293
aVAnd essentially, the story is this with right whales,
p294
aVthat about a million years ago, there was
p295
aVone species of right whale on the planet,
p296
aVbut as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated,
p297
aVthe species sort of separated,
p298
aVand today we have essentially two distinct stocks.
p299
aVWe have the Southern right whale that we see here
p300
aVand the North Atlantic right whale that we see here
p301
aVwith a mom and calf off the coast of Florida.
p302
aVNow, both species were hunted to the brink of extinction
p303
aVby the early whalers,
p304
aVbut the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better
p305
aVbecause they're located in places
p306
aVfarther away from human activity.
p307
aa(lp308
VThe North Atlantic right whale is listed as
p309
aVthe most endangered species on the planet today
p310
aVbecause they are urban whales; they live along the east coast
p311
aVof North America, United States and Canada,
p312
aVand they have to deal with all these urban ills.
p313
aVThis photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida.
p314
aVYou can see the coal burning plant in the background.
p315
aVThey have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals
p316
aVthat are flushed out into the ocean,
p317
aVand maybe even affecting their reproduction.
p318
aVThey also get entangled in fishing gear.
p319
aVThis is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale.
p320
aVAnd those white markings are not natural markings.
p321
aVThese are entanglement scars.
p322
aV72 percent of the population has such scars,
p323
aVbut most don't shed the gear, things like lobster traps and crab pots.
p324
aVThey hold on to them, and it eventually kills them.
p325
aVAnd the other problem is they get hit by ships.
p326
aVAnd this was an animal that was struck by a ship
p327
aVin Nova Scotia, Canada
p328
aVbeing towed in, where they did a necropsy
p329
aVto confirm the cause of death,
p330
aVwhich was indeed a ship strike.
p331
aVSo all of these ills are stacking up against these animals
p332
aVand keeping their numbers very low.
p333
aa(lp334
VAnd to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population,
p335
aVI went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales
p336
aVthat had only been discovered about 10 years ago
p337
aVin the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand, a place called the Auckland Islands.
p338
aVI went down there in the winter time.
p339
aVAnd these are animals that had never seen humans before,
p340
aVand I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen.
p341
aVAnd I got in the water with them,
p342
aVand I was amazed at how curious they were.
p343
aVThis photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet
p344
aVand one of these amazingly beautiful, 45-foot,
p345
aV70-ton whales,
p346
aVlike a city bus just swimming up, you know.
p347
aVThey were in perfect condition,
p348
aVvery fat and healthy, robust, no entanglement scars,
p349
aVthe way they're supposed to look.
p350
aVYou know, I read that the pilgrims, when they landed at Plymouth Rock
p351
aVin Massachusetts in 1620,
p352
aVwrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay
p353
aVon the backs of right whales.
p354
aVAnd we can't go back and see that today,
p355
aVbut maybe we can preserve what we have left.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd I wanted to close this program with a story of hope,
p358
aVa story I did on marine reserves
p359
aVas sort of a solution
p360
aVto the problem of overfishing, the global fish crisis story.
p361
aVI settled on working in the country of New Zealand
p362
aVbecause New Zealand was rather progressive,
p363
aVand is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.
p364
aVAnd I really wanted this story to be about three things:
p365
aVI wanted it to be about abundance,
p366
aVabout diversity and about resilience.
p367
aVAnd one of the first places I worked
p368
aVwas a reserve called Goat Island
p369
aVin Leigh of New Zealand.
p370
aVWhat the scientists there told me was that
p371
aVwhen protected this first marine reserve in 1975,
p372
aVthey hoped and expected that certain things might happen.
p373
aa(lp374
VFor example, they hoped that certain species of fish
p375
aVlike the New Zealand snapper would return
p376
aVbecause they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction.
p377
aVAnd they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen.
p378
aVFor example, these fish
p379
aVpredate on sea urchins,
p380
aVand when the fish were all gone,
p381
aVall anyone ever saw underwater
p382
aVwas just acres and acres of sea urchins.
p383
aVBut when the fish came back
p384
aVand began predating and controlling the urchin population,
p385
aVlow and behold, kelp forests emerged in shallow water.
p386
aVAnd that's because the urchins eat kelp.
p387
aVSo when the fish control the urchin population,
p388
aVthe ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium.
p389
aVYou know, this is probably how the ocean looked here
p390
aVone or 200 years ago, but nobody was around to tell us.
p391
aa(lp392
VI worked in other parts of New Zealand as well,
p393
aVin beautiful, fragile, protected areas
p394
aVlike in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found.
p395
aVLittle blue cod swimming in for a dash of color.
p396
aVIn the northern part of New Zealand,
p397
aVI dove in the blue water, where the water's a little warmer,
p398
aVand photographed animals like this giant sting ray
p399
aVswimming through an underwater canyon.
p400
aVEvery part of the ecosystem in this place
p401
aVseems very healthy,
p402
aVfrom tiny, little animals like a nudibrank
p403
aVcrawling over encrusting sponge
p404
aVor a leatherjacket
p405
aVthat is a very important animal in this ecosystem
p406
aVbecause it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold.
p407
aa(lp408
VAnd I wanted to finish with this photograph,
p409
aVa picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand
p410
aVwhen I just laid on the bottom
p411
aVamidst a school of fish swirling around me.
p412
aVAnd I was in a place that had only been protected
p413
aVabout 20 years ago.
p414
aVAnd I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years,
p415
aVand they said that the marine life was better here today
p416
aVthan it was in the 1960s.
p417
aVAnd that's because it's been protected,
p418
aVthat it has come back.
p419
aa(lp420
VSo I think the message is clear.
p421
aVThe ocean is, indeed, resilient and tolerant to a point,
p422
aVbut we must be good custodians.
p423
aVI became an underwater photographer
p424
aVbecause I fell in love with the sea,
p425
aVand I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it,
p426
aVand I don't think it's too late.
p427
aa(lp428
VThank you very much.

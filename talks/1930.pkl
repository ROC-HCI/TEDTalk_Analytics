VWhat makes a great leader today?
p5
aVMany of us carry this image
p6
aVof this all-knowing superhero
p7
aVwho stands and commands
p8
aVand protects his followers.
p9
aVBut that's kind of an image from another time,
p10
aVand what's also outdated
p11
aVare the leadership development programs
p12
aVthat are based on success models
p13
aVfor a world that was, not a world that is
p14
aVor that is coming.
p15
aa(lp16
VWe conducted a study of 4,000 companies,
p17
aVand we asked them, let's see the effectiveness
p18
aVof your leadership development programs.
p19
aVFifty-eight percent of the companies
p20
aVcited significant talent gaps
p21
aVfor critical leadership roles.
p22
aVThat means that despite corporate training programs,
p23
aVoff-sites, assessments, coaching, all of these things,
p24
aVmore than half the companies
p25
aVhad failed to grow enough great leaders.
p26
aVYou may be asking yourself,
p27
aVis my company helping me to prepare
p28
aVto be a great 21st-century leader?
p29
aVThe odds are, probably not.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, I've spent 25 years of my professional life
p32
aVobserving what makes great leaders.
p33
aVI've worked inside Fortune 500 companies,
p34
aVI've advised over 200 CEOs,
p35
aVand I've cultivated more leadership pipelines
p36
aVthan you can imagine.
p37
aVBut a few years ago, I noticed a disturbing trend
p38
aVin leadership preparation.
p39
aVI noticed that, despite all the efforts,
p40
aVthere were familiar stories that kept resurfacing
p41
aVabout individuals.
p42
aVOne story was about Chris,
p43
aVa high-potential, superstar leader
p44
aVwho moves to a new unit and fails,
p45
aVdestroying unrecoverable value.
p46
aVAnd then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO,
p47
aVwho was so frustrated
p48
aVbecause her company is cited
p49
aVas a best company for leaders,
p50
aVbut only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped
p51
aVto lead their crucial initiatives.
p52
aVAnd then there were stories
p53
aVlike the senior leadership team
p54
aVof a once-thriving business
p55
aVthat's surprised by a market shift,
p56
aVfinds itself having to force the company
p57
aVto reduce its size in half
p58
aVor go out of business.
p59
aa(lp60
VNow, these recurring stories
p61
aVcause me to ask two questions.
p62
aVWhy are the leadership gaps widening
p63
aVwhen there's so much more investment
p64
aVin leadership development?
p65
aVAnd what are the great leaders doing
p66
aVdistinctly different to thrive and grow?
p67
aVOne of the things that I did,
p68
aVI was so consumed by these questions
p69
aVand also frustrated by those stories,
p70
aVthat I left my job
p71
aVso that I could study this full time,
p72
aVand I took a year to travel
p73
aVto different parts of the world
p74
aVto learn about effective and ineffective
p75
aVleadership practices in companies,
p76
aVcountries and nonprofit organizations.
p77
aVAnd so I did things like travel to South Africa,
p78
aVwhere I had an opportunity to understand
p79
aVhow Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time
p80
aVin anticipating and navigating
p81
aVhis political, social and economic context.
p82
aVI also met a number of nonprofit leaders
p83
aVwho, despite very limited financial resources,
p84
aVwere making a huge impact in the world,
p85
aVoften bringing together seeming adversaries.
p86
aVAnd I spent countless hours in presidential libraries
p87
aVtrying to understand how the environment
p88
aVhad shaped the leaders,
p89
aVthe moves that they made,
p90
aVand then the impact of those moves
p91
aVbeyond their tenure.
p92
aVAnd then, when I returned to work full time,
p93
aVin this role, I joined with wonderful colleagues
p94
aVwho were also interested in these questions.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow, from all this, I distilled
p97
aVthe characteristics of leaders who are thriving
p98
aVand what they do differently,
p99
aVand then I also distilled
p100
aVthe preparation practices that enable people
p101
aVto grow to their potential.
p102
aVI want to share some of those with you now.
p103
aa(lp104
V("What makes a great leader in the 21st century?")
p105
aa(lp106
VIn a 21st-century world, which is more global,
p107
aVdigitally enabled and transparent,
p108
aVwith faster speeds of information  flow and innovation,
p109
aVand where nothing big gets done
p110
aVwithout some kind of a complex matrix,
p111
aVrelying on traditional development practices
p112
aVwill stunt your growth as a leader.
p113
aVIn fact, traditional assessments
p114
aVlike narrow 360 surveys or outdated performance criteria
p115
aVwill give you false positives,
p116
aVlulling you into thinking that you are more prepared
p117
aVthan you really are.
p118
aVLeadership in the 21st century is defined
p119
aVand evidenced by three questions.
p120
aa(lp121
VWhere are you looking
p122
aVto anticipate the next change
p123
aVto your business model or your life?
p124
aVThe answer to this question is on your calendar.
p125
aVWho are you spending time with? On what topics?
p126
aVWhere are you traveling? What are you reading?
p127
aVAnd then how are you distilling this
p128
aVinto understanding potential discontinuities,
p129
aVand then making a decision to do something
p130
aVright now so that you're prepared and ready?
p131
aVThere's a leadership team that does a practice
p132
aVwhere they bring together each member
p133
aVcollecting, here are trends that impact me,
p134
aVhere are trends that impact another team member,
p135
aVand they share these,
p136
aVand then make decisions, to course-correct a strategy
p137
aVor to anticipate a new move.
p138
aVGreat leaders are not head-down.
p139
aVThey see around corners,
p140
aVshaping their future, not just reacting to it.
p141
aa(lp142
VThe second question is,
p143
aVwhat is the diversity measure
p144
aVof your personal and professional stakeholder network?
p145
aVYou know, we hear often about  good ol' boy networks
p146
aVand they're certainly alive and  well in many institutions.
p147
aVBut to some extent, we all have a network
p148
aVof people that we're comfortable with.
p149
aVSo this question is about your capacity
p150
aVto develop relationships with people
p151
aVthat are very different than you.
p152
aVAnd those differences can be biological,
p153
aVphysical, functional, political,  cultural, socioeconomic.
p154
aVAnd yet, despite all these differences,
p155
aVthey connect with you
p156
aVand they trust you enough
p157
aVto cooperate with you
p158
aVin achieving a shared goal.
p159
aVGreat leaders understand
p160
aVthat having a more diverse network
p161
aVis a source of pattern identification
p162
aVat greater levels and also of solutions,
p163
aVbecause you have people that are thinking
p164
aVdifferently than you are.
p165
aa(lp166
VThird question: are you courageous enough
p167
aVto abandon a practice that has  made you successful in the past?
p168
aVThere's an expression: Go along to get along.
p169
aVBut if you follow this advice,
p170
aVchances are as a leader,
p171
aVyou're going to keep doing what's familiar and comfortable.
p172
aVGreat leaders dare to be different.
p173
aVThey don't just talk about risk-taking,
p174
aVthey actually do it.
p175
aVAnd one of the leaders shared with me the fact that
p176
aVthe most impactful development comes
p177
aVwhen you are able to build the emotional stamina
p178
aVto withstand people telling you that your new idea
p179
aVis naïve or reckless or just plain stupid.
p180
aVNow interestingly, the people who will join you
p181
aVare not your usual suspects in your network.
p182
aVThey're often people that think differently
p183
aVand therefore are willing to join you
p184
aVin taking a courageous leap.
p185
aVAnd it's a leap, not a step.
p186
aVMore than traditional leadership programs,
p187
aVanswering these three questions
p188
aVwill determine your effectiveness
p189
aVas a 21st-century leader.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo what makes a great leader in the 21st century?
p192
aVI've met many, and they stand out.
p193
aVThey are women and men
p194
aVwho are preparing themselves
p195
aVnot for the comfortable predictability of yesterday
p196
aVbut also for the realities of today
p197
aVand all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow.
p198
aa(lp199
VThank you.

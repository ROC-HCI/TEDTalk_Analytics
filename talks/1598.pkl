VI was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car,
p5
aVI basically had to roll down the window.
p6
aVIt was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly,
p7
aVand my father would not let us use the air conditioner.
p8
aVHe said that it would overheat the engine.
p9
aVAnd you might remember, some of you,
p10
aVhow the cars were back then, and it was
p11
aVa common problem of overheating.
p12
aVBut it was also the signal that capped the use,
p13
aVor overuse, of energy-consuming devices.
p14
aa(lp15
VThings have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.
p16
aVWe blast the air conditioning the entire way,
p17
aVand we never experience overheating.
p18
aVSo there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop.
p19
aa(lp20
VGreat, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings.
p21
aVIn the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls.
p22
aVThe thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior
p23
aVvery cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime,
p24
aVand the small windows were also very good because
p25
aVit limited the amount of temperature transfer
p26
aVbetween the interior and exterior.
p27
aVThen in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass,
p28
aVrolled steel and mass production, we were able
p29
aVto make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views,
p30
aVand with that came the irreversible reliance on
p31
aVmechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces.
p32
aVOver time, the buildings got taller and bigger,
p33
aVour engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems
p34
aVwere massive. They require a huge amount of energy.
p35
aVThey give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere,
p36
aVand for some of you may understand the heat island effect
p37
aVin cities, where the urban areas are much more warm
p38
aVthan the adjacent rural areas,
p39
aVbut we also have problems that, when we lose power,
p40
aVwe can't open a window here, and so
p41
aVthe buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant
p42
aVuntil that air conditioning system can start up again.
p43
aVEven worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings
p44
aVmove towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it
p45
aVjust by making mechanical systems more and more efficient.
p46
aVWe need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us
p49
aVout of this hole that we've dug?
p50
aVIf we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know,
p51
aVI was a biology major before I went into architecture,
p52
aVthe human skin is the organ that naturally regulates
p53
aVthe temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing.
p54
aVThat's the first line of defense for the body.
p55
aVIt has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things
p56
aVthat work together very dynamically and very efficiently,
p57
aVand so what I propose is that our building skins
p58
aVshould be more similar to human skin,
p59
aVand by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive
p60
aVand differentiated, depending on where it is.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd this gets me back to my research.
p63
aVWhat I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.
p64
aVI presently, or currently, work with smart materials,
p65
aVand a smart thermo-bimetal.
p66
aVFirst of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires
p67
aVno controls and it requires no energy,
p68
aVand that's a very big deal for architecture.
p69
aVWhat it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.
p70
aVYou can see that here by the different reflection on this side.
p71
aVAnd because it has two different coefficients of expansion,
p72
aVwhen heated, one side will expand faster than the other
p73
aVand result in a curling action.
p74
aVSo in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see
p75
aVhow the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow
p76
aVair to ventilate through the system,
p77
aVand in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity
p78
aVof having these strips together can try to make
p79
aVbigger movement happen when also heated,
p80
aVand currently have this installation at the Materials & Applications gallery
p81
aVin Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it.
p82
aVIt's called "Bloom," and the surface is made completely
p83
aVout of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy
p84
aVthat does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that
p85
aVwhen the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through,
p86
aVand in other areas, it's a ventilating system,
p87
aVso that hot, trapped air underneath can actually
p88
aVmove through and out when necessary.
p89
aa(lp90
VYou can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun,
p91
aVas it moves across the surface, as well as the shade,
p92
aVeach of the tiles moves individually.
p93
aVKeep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today,
p94
aVthis thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces
p95
aVand there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.
p96
aVAnd the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate
p97
aVeach one to be very, very specific to its location,
p98
aVto the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo this kind of proof of concept project
p101
aVhas a lot of implications
p102
aVto actual future application in architecture,
p103
aVand in this case, here you see a house,
p104
aVthat's for a developer in China,
p105
aVand it's actually a four-story glass box.
p106
aVIt's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access,
p107
aVbut now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer,
p108
aVit's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually
p109
aVopen and close as that sun moves around on that surface.
p110
aVIn addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy,
p111
aVso that it can differentiate from some of the public areas
p112
aVin the space during different times of day.
p113
aVAnd what it basically implies is that, in houses now,
p114
aVwe don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore
p115
aVbecause we can sheath the building with these things,
p116
aVas well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.
p117
aa(lp118
VI'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market,
p119
aVand so here you see a pretty typical
p120
aVdouble-glazed window panel, and in that panel,
p121
aVbetween those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing,
p122
aVI'm trying to work on making
p123
aVa thermo-bimetal pattern system
p124
aVso that when the sun hits that outside layer
p125
aVand heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal
p126
aVwill begin to curl, and what actually will happen then
p127
aVis it'll start to block out the sun
p128
aVin certain areas of the building,
p129
aVand totally, if necessary.
p130
aVAnd so you can imagine, even in this application, that
p131
aVin a high-rise building where the panel systems go
p132
aVfrom floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface
p133
aVcould be differentiated at different times of day
p134
aVdepending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd these are some later studies that I'm working on
p137
aVright now that are on the boards, where you can see,
p138
aVin the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it's actually
p139
aVsmaller pieces of thermometal, and it's actually going to,
p140
aVwe're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes.
p141
aa(lp142
VThis last project is also of components.
p143
aVThe influence \u2014 and if you have noticed, one of my
p144
aVspheres of influence is biology \u2014 is from a grasshopper.
p145
aVAnd grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.
p146
aVThey breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles,
p147
aVand they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down,
p148
aVand so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can
p149
aVconsider that in architecture too, how we can bring
p150
aVair through holes in the sides of a building.
p151
aVAnd so you see here some early studies of blocks,
p152
aVwhere those holes are actually coming through,
p153
aVand this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied,
p154
aVand this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little
p155
aVhard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.
p156
aVOn the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal
p157
aVis flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks,
p158
aVand on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls
p159
aVand allows that air to pass through, so those are two different
p160
aVcomponents that I'm working on, and again,
p161
aVit's a completely different thing, because you can imagine
p162
aVthat air could potentially be coming through the walls
p163
aVinstead of opening windows.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo I want to leave you with one last impression about
p166
aVthe project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.
p167
aVWhen you're tired of opening and closing those blinds
p168
aVday after day, when you're on vacation
p169
aVand there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls,
p170
aVor when there's a power outage, and you have
p171
aVno electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetals
p172
aVwill still be working tirelessly, efficiently
p173
aVand endlessly. Thank you. (Applause)

building materials be more adaptable? Why can&#39;t they function more like clothing, or even human skin? Having studied biology at Princeton University intending to go to medical school, Sung applies principles of biology to her work as an assistant professor of architecture at the University of Southern California. She explores architecture as an extension of the body, challenging the notion that buildings ought to be static and climate-controlled. Rather, they should be able to adapt to their environment through self-ventilation. In November 2011, Sung exhibited her art installation &quot;Bloom&quot; in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. The installation is 20 feet tall and made with 14,000 completely unique pieces of thermo-bimetal, a smart material made of two different metals laminated together. This metal is dynamic and responsive, curling as air temperatures rise, resulting in a beautiful sculpture that breathes.</p>", "slug": "doris_kim_sung", "whotheyare": "Doris Kim Sung is a biology student turned architect interested in thermo-bimetals, smart materials that respond dynamically to temperature change.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 1424, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/fddcaf63ac4ef5060200d5f2cbaac21ec35fdfff_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Metal that breathes", "take_action": null, "comments": 16088, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/be8bc8941155fcc0f96e25910d486ef6611e4a1c_1600x1200.jpg", "description": "Modern buildings with floor-to-ceiling windows give spectacular views, but they require a lot of energy to cool.

VWelcome to Africa! Or rather, I should say, welcome home.
p5
aVBecause this is where it all really began, isn't it?
p6
aVLooking at fossils dating back several millions of years \u2014
p7
aVit all points to evidence that life
p8
aVfor the human species as we know it began right here.
p9
aVWe are on an amazing journey the next four days.
p10
aVYou're going to hear stories of "Africa: The Next Chapter."
p11
aVFantastic tales, anecdotes from speakers.
p12
aVBut I want to turn that upside down for a moment,
p13
aVand get something out on the table and clear the air so to say.
p14
aVWhat's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa?
p15
aVAnd this is not a rhetorical question.
p16
aVI actually want answers from you.
p17
aVGo for it! The worst.
p18
aVFamine.
p19
aVCorruption.
p20
aVMore.
p21
aVGenocide.
p22
aVAIDS.
p23
aVSlavery.
p24
aVThat's enough.
p25
aa(lp26
VWe've all heard these things.
p27
aVBut this is about Africa, the story we have not heard.
p28
aVThe stories that we want to know,
p29
aVand the stories that do exist about positive tales.
p30
aVA part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities
p31
aVthat exist on this continent,
p32
aVto separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction.
p33
aVTo go to the actual data and statistics that exist
p34
aVabout the actual things that are happening on the ground
p35
aVthat make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you.
p36
aVSo let's get going because Africa,
p37
aVto some degree, is on a turnaround.
p38
aVA turnaround in terms of how it manages its image,
p39
aVand how it takes control of its own destiny.
p40
aVAnd turnarounds are part and parcel
p41
aVof what I have focused on for most of my professional career.
p42
aVAnd it all started almost a decade ago,
p43
aVas a young consultant at McKinsey & Company
p44
aVat their first African office in Johannesburg.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd there we worked with leading CEOs
p47
aVon African issues, and African companies on turnarounds,
p48
aVmaking the companies not just the best in Africa
p49
aVbut the best globally.
p50
aVBut I really formalized this focus on turnarounds
p51
aVwhen I was completing my MBA in the United States.
p52
aVIt all began with a fantastic phone call.
p53
aVIt was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter,
p54
aVHarvard Business School guru and a professor of mine.
p55
aVAnd she said, "I want to write a case, Euvin \u2014
p56
aVa case on a public-sector leader
p57
aVthat has lessons for the corporate world."
p58
aVAnd the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela.
p59
aVBecause Nelson Mandela, as he took over power
p60
aVas the first democratically-elected president of South Africa,
p61
aVfaced a situation of a country
p62
aVthat could have slid into the abyss of chaos.
p63
aVBut he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow the case, "Nelson Mandela: Change Leader,"
p66
aVbecame part of the research base for a chapter
p67
aVin Rosabeth's new book called "Confidence."
p68
aVAnd "Confidence" became a New York Times bestseller
p69
aVand topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list.
p70
aVAnd why I tell you this story is because later, when I was interviewed
p71
aVon SABC Africa, on a pan-African broadcast, they asked,
p72
aV"What is your key lesson, or the key thing you enjoy the most?" \u2014
p73
aVbecause it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project.
p74
aVThe lesson from that was that it was Africa \u2014 an African story \u2014
p75
aVthat was used to share news with the rest of the world
p76
aVof what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds.
p77
aVAfrica was being used as a success story!
p78
aa(lp79
VSo I want to share with you a personal story
p80
aVabout a turnaround or a transformation.
p81
aVAnd that has to do with me
p82
aVbecause in 1994, I packed a few things into a backpack
p83
aVand headed off for a year of travel
p84
aVin the middle of my university career.
p85
aVYou should have seen my parents' reaction!
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VBut very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa,
p90
aVin South Africa \u2014 at the very north, in Egypt.
p91
aVAnd I sought out the most remote places.
p92
aVI went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops.
p93
aVAnd the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things,
p94
aVbut the key thing is that it was the place
p95
aVthat Alexander the Great went to
p96
aVwhen he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him.
p97
aVAnd legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert.
p98
aVHalf his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm.
p99
aVAnd myth says that he had an audience with the oracle,
p100
aVand it foretold his destiny of greatness.
p101
aVThis was 300 BC.
p102
aVSo Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, the thing I remember about Siwa
p105
aVwas the magical view of the sky at night.
p106
aVWith no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places
p107
aVthat when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.
p108
aVFast forward to 2002.
p109
aVI'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts
p110
aVat the Healthcare Development Conference.
p111
aVAnd I see the same picture, but from the opposite side.
p112
aVA satellite picture looking down at the earth.
p113
aVAnd it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me
p114
aVbecause I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment.
p115
aVAnd I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point.
p116
aVThe first thing that I saw was North America at night \u2014
p117
aVglowing, in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd then I saw it \u2014 Africa. Quite literally the "Dark Continent."
p120
aVAnd while Africa may be dark,
p121
aVthe thing that brought the message home to me
p122
aVwas that this is the challenge we are facing,
p123
aVbut it's also the opportunity.
p124
aVBecause whilst Africa may be dark \u2014 other than the few specks
p125
aVthat exist north and in the south and other areas \u2014
p126
aVit's aglow with the light in the hearts
p127
aVof the millions of people that are there.
p128
aVEntrepreneurs, dynamic people, people with hope.
p129
aVIt was George Kimble, the geographer, who said
p130
aVthat, "The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it."
p131
aVSo let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent
p132
aVthat has so much to offer.
p133
aa(lp134
VLet's start unpacking it.
p135
aVAfrica is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia.
p136
aVIt also is the second most populated continent,
p137
aVwith 900 million people.
p138
aVIn fact \u2014 coming back to the land mass \u2014 Africa is so big
p139
aVthat you could fit in the continental United States,
p140
aVChina, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space.
p141
aVAfrica is home to over 1,000 languages \u2014
p142
aV2,000 is another estimate that's out there \u2014
p143
aVwith over 2,000 languages and dialects.
p144
aVBut you could say, "Invest in Africa in over 1,000 languages,
p145
aVand it wouldn't make a difference."
p146
aVWhat does the data say?
p147
aVAs an investment banker, I'm in the cross-flow of information
p148
aVand the changes that are taking place in capital markets.
p149
aVSo I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals, or signs,
p150
aVand winds of change that are sweeping this continent.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo let's start on that.
p153
aVAnd let's start at the high level, on the macro-factors.
p154
aVInflation, in general, is coming down across Africa \u2014
p155
aVthat's the first sign \u2014
p156
aVin many countries reaching double-digit figures.
p157
aVSo let's start looking at some of those.
p158
aVI call it my Z.E.N. cluster.
p159
aVZambia: from 2004 to 2006, moves from the 18 percent in inflation
p160
aVto the nine percent.
p161
aVEgypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent.
p162
aVNigeria: a similar situation,
p163
aVfrom the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits.
p164
aVMore fascinating, you have other countries \u2014 South Africa,
p165
aVMauritius, Namibia \u2014 all in single digits.
p166
aVBut that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies \u2014
p167
aVcurrencies going through an extreme time of stability.
p168
aVBut that's looking at the big picture.
p169
aVAnd the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country.
p170
aVIt's made up \u2014
p171
aa(lp172
V(Applause)
p173
aa(lp174
VIt's made up of 53 different countries.
p175
aVSo the very definition \u2014 to say "invest in Africa" is a no-go.
p176
aVIt's meaningless.
p177
aVEach country has a unique value proposition.
p178
aVYou can make money, you can lose money in Africa.
p179
aVBut opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist.
p180
aVAnd this is what today is about \u2014
p181
aVit's about discussing those very opportunities.
p182
aVSo let's start getting into the countries
p183
aVand into the specific material and data.
p184
aVI was recently elected, as Emeka mentioned,
p185
aVas the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America.
p186
aVAnd I'm very proud and happy to be in that role
p187
aVbecause it is a fascinating position to be in.
p188
aVTo hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity,
p189
aVof decisions about trade and companies wanting to come.
p190
aVSo the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa.
p191
aVBut not the South Africa we always talk about \u2014
p192
aVthe gold, the minerals, the First World infrastructure \u2014
p193
aVa bit about the other side of it.
p194
aa(lp195
VFor example, South Africa was recently voted as the top destination
p196
aVfor the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers.
p197
aVSame language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense.
p198
aVOther headlines that have recently reached South Africa
p199
aVwere Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity.
p200
aVHeadline in South Africa: "They have landed." Quite ominous.
p201
aVBut what were they there for? To acquire assets.
p202
aVBing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimony
p203
aVto the confidence they are starting to place in the economy.
p204
aVBecause it is actually a long-term play.
p205
aVBeing a retailer, it is a play on the belief
p206
aVthat this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow,
p207
aVthat the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue.
p208
aVBut the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa
p209
aVbecause there's so much happening.
p210
aVUndoubtedly, Nigeria is clearly a hot spot.
p211
aVChallenges \u2014 and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut looking at Goldman Sachs' work \u2014 we had the famous BRIC Report.
p214
aVThe new report, "The Next Eleven," highlights that by 2020
p215
aVNigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.
p216
aVIt's an investment opportunity. Think about that.
p217
aVIs anyone \u2014 our banks, our investors \u2014
p218
aVseriously thinking about going to Nigeria?
p219
aVIf you haven't, why not?
p220
aVWhat's going on in Nigeria? A couple of things.
p221
aVI want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets.
p222
aVBellwether signs again.
p223
aVGuarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond
p224
aVout of Africa, and this excludes South Africa.
p225
aVBut the first Eurobond, the raising of international capital
p226
aVoffshore, off its own balance sheet,
p227
aVwithout any sovereign backing \u2014
p228
aVthat is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy.
p229
aVWithout any sovereign backing,
p230
aVa Nigerian company raising capital offshore.
p231
aVIt's just a sign of things to come.
p232
aa(lp233
VLooking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent
p234
aVof the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent.
p235
aVIt's an important strategic partner.
p236
aVLet's put Nigeria in perspective.
p237
aV2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day \u2014
p238
aVthe same league as Kuwait, the same league as Venezuela.
p239
aVBut with Africa, let's start being careful about this.
p240
aVAnd Emeka and I have had these discussions.
p241
aVWe have to move away from what's called "the curse of the commodities."
p242
aVBecause it's not about oil, it's not about commodities.
p243
aVFor Africa to truly be sustainable,
p244
aVwe have to move beyond to other industries.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo let's unpack those very quickly,
p247
aVand I'm going to move through these very, very, very fast
p248
aVbecause I can see that clock counting down.
p249
aVWhat else is going on there? Egypt.
p250
aVEgypt is launching a first large industrial zone \u2014
p251
aV2.8 billion investment.
p252
aVThe announcement just came out the last few weeks.
p253
aVClose to the Mediterranean, near Alexandria \u2014
p254
aVtextiles, petrochemicals.
p255
aVIt's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company.
p256
aVSo they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse
p257
aVacross the industries \u2014 away from oil.
p258
aa(lp259
VLet's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry.
p260
aVWhat's going on there?
p261
aVIn Tanzania last week, we had the launch
p262
aVof the East African Organic Produce Standard.
p263
aVAgain, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholders
p264
aVin East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices.
p265
aVIt ties in with small-scale farmers
p266
aVin terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers.
p267
aVAgain, opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price.
p268
aVUganda: the New Forest Company,
p269
aVreplanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important?
p270
aVAs the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [we will need]
p271
aVpoles for rolling out electricity.
p272
aVBut here is the sweetener in the deal.
p273
aVThey're going to be tapping into carbon credits.
p274
aVLet's go back to Nigeria.
p275
aVThe banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation,
p276
aVfrom over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system.
p277
aVBut what's going on there? Only 10 percent of the country is banked.
p278
aVThe largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.
p279
aV135 million-plus people. Think about that.
p280
aVThere are only 700 ATMs in the country. Opportunity.
p281
aa(lp282
VThe same for telecoms across the country.
p283
aVNow let's look at the continent as a whole.
p284
aVPeople look at the roads, for example, and they'd say,
p285
aV"Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred. Ah, problem!"
p286
aVIt's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up,
p287
aVinflation is affected.
p288
aVNigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent.
p289
aVIn general, more than 50 percent of roads are untarred.
p290
aVThis is an opportunity! Energy needs \u2014 it's an opportunity.
p291
aVSo what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing?
p292
aVLet's look at the stock markets in Africa.
p293
aVIf I had to ask you, "In 2005 what was the best performing stock market
p294
aVor stock exchange in the world?" Would Egypt come to mind?
p295
aVIn 2005, the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent.
p296
aVWhat's going on in some of the other countries?
p297
aVLet's look at some 2006 numbers. Kenya: over 60 percent. Nigeria: over 40 percent.
p298
aVSouth Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones.
p299
aVThese are the trends that are taking place.
p300
aVBut in any investment decision, the key question is,
p301
aV"What is my alternative investment?"
p302
aa(lp303
VBecause in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital.
p304
aVAnd global capital is agnostic \u2014 it has no loyalties.
p305
aVThere's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup.
p306
aVWhat Africa is providing is a diversification play,
p307
aVand also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor
p308
aVthat's aware of what he or she is doing.
p309
aVNow, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things,
p310
aVand countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things,
p311
aVcomparisons become important.
p312
aV10 years ago there, were very few countries
p313
aVthat received sovereign ratings from
p314
aVthe Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch's.
p315
aVToday, 16 African countries and growing
p316
aVhave sovereign country ratings. What does this mean?
p317
aVTake Nigeria again: double B-minus \u2014
p318
aVin the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison.
p319
aVThe backbone of making investment decisions
p320
aVfor global holders of capital.
p321
aVSome other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus.
p322
aVBakino Faso: B-minus. And so on.
p323
aa(lp324
VIn fact, one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa.
p325
aVWhy are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow.
p326
aVSo one of the big bellwethers,
p327
aVand one of my final points I want to mention, is
p328
aVthe interesting thing I read is that CNBC
p329
aVhas launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this?
p330
aVIt's the 24-hour rolling African news channel.
p331
aVThey're doing it because they are expecting things to happen.
p332
aVMe and you, the investments we are going to be making,
p333
aVthe investments the world is going to be making \u2014
p334
aVthat's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa.
p335
aVSo that's the change that's coming down the pipeline.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo in conclusion, I want to turn back to that very slide
p338
aVthat made such a deep impact on me all those years ago.
p339
aVThis time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002,
p340
aVand ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa,
p341
aVthink about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.
p342
aVBecause there are amazing opportunities available.
p343
aVAnd think about the concept of transformation
p344
aVin the back of your mind
p345
aVbecause things can be turned around rather quickly.
p346
aa(lp347
VIn 1899, Joseph Conrad released "The Heart of Darkness,"
p348
aVa tale of grim horror along the Congo River.
p349
aVIf one looks carefully, on the Congo River
p350
aVis one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river
p351
aVgenerating light \u2014 the old heart of darkness
p352
aVnow generating light with hydro-electric power.
p353
aVThat is a transformation in power of ideas.
p354
aVSo the next step, over the next four days,
p355
aVis us exploring more of these ideas.
p356
aVAnd perchance, if you can always keep this picture in your mind,
p357
aVthat when we convene maybe in the distant future, in 2020,
p358
aVthat picture will look very different.
p359
aVThank you.

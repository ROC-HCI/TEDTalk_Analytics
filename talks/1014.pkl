(lp4
VSo I'm going to talk about work;
p5
aVspecifically, why people can't seem to get work done at work,
p6
aVwhich is a problem we all kind of have.
p7
aVBut let's sort of start at the beginning.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo, we have companies and non-profits and charities
p10
aVand all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort.
p11
aVAnd they expect these people who work for them
p12
aVto do great work \u2014
p13
aVI would hope, at least.
p14
aVAt least good work, hopefully, at least it's good work \u2014
p15
aVhopefully great work.
p16
aVAnd so what they typically do is they decide
p17
aVthat all these people need to come together in one place to do that work.
p18
aVSo a company, or a charity, or an organization of any kind,
p19
aVunless you're working in Africa, if you're really lucky to do that \u2014
p20
aVmost people have to go to an office every day.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd so these companies,
p23
aVthey build offices.
p24
aVThey go out and they buy a building, or they rent a building,
p25
aVor they lease some space,
p26
aVand they fill this space with stuff.
p27
aVThey fill it with tables, or desks,
p28
aVchairs, computer equipment,
p29
aVsoftware, Internet access,
p30
aVmaybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,
p31
aVand they expect their employees, or their volunteers,
p32
aVto come to that location every day to do great work.
p33
aVIt seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that.
p34
aa(lp35
VHowever, if you actually talk to people
p36
aVand even question yourself, and you ask yourself,
p37
aVwhere do you really want to go when you really need to get something done?
p38
aVYou'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say.
p39
aVIf you ask people the question:
p40
aVWhere do you need to go when you need to get something done?
p41
aVTypically, you get three different kinds of answers.
p42
aVOne is kind of a place or a location or a room.
p43
aVAnother one is a moving object,
p44
aVand a third is a time.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo here are some examples.
p47
aVI've been asking people this question for about 10 years:
p48
aV"Where do you go when you really need to get something done?"
p49
aVI'll hear things like, the porch, the deck, the kitchen.
p50
aVI'll hear things like an extra room in the house,
p51
aVthe basement,
p52
aVthe coffee shop, the library.
p53
aVAnd then you'll hear things like the train,
p54
aVa plane, a car \u2014 so, the commute.
p55
aVAnd then you'll hear people say,
p56
aV"Well, it doesn't really matter where I am,
p57
aVas long as it's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends."
p58
aVYou almost never hear someone say, "The office."
p59
aVBut businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office,
p60
aVand they're making people go to it all the time,
p61
aVyet people don't do work in the office.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhat is that about?
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VWhy is that? Why is that happening?
p68
aVAnd what you find out is,
p69
aVif you dig a little bit deeper, you find out that people \u2014
p70
aVthis is what happens:
p71
aVPeople go to work,
p72
aVand they're basically trading in their work day
p73
aVfor a series of "work moments" \u2014 that's what happens at the office.
p74
aVYou don't have a work day anymore. You have work moments.
p75
aVIt's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart,
p76
aVand you walk in and your day is shredded to bits,
p77
aVbecause you have 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there,
p78
aVand something else happens, you're pulled off your work,
p79
aVthen you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch, then you have something else to do ...
p80
aVThen you've got 15 minutes, and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question,
p81
aVand before you know it, it's 5 p.m.,
p82
aVand you look back on the day,
p83
aVand you realize that you didn't get anything done.
p84
aVWe've all been through this.
p85
aVWe probably went through it yesterday or the day before, or the day before that.
p86
aVYou look back on your day,
p87
aVand you're like, "I got nothing done today.
p88
aVI was at work. I sat at my desk. I used my expensive computer.
p89
aVI used the software they told me to use.
p90
aVI went to these meetings I was asked to go to.
p91
aVI did these conference calls. I did all this stuff.
p92
aVBut I didn't actually do anything.
p93
aVI just did tasks.
p94
aVI didn't actually get meaningful work done."
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd what you find is that, especially with creative people \u2014
p97
aVdesigners, programmers, writers, engineers, thinkers \u2014
p98
aVthat people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time
p99
aVto get something done.
p100
aVYou cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes
p101
aVand really think about a problem.
p102
aVYou might have a quick idea,
p103
aVbut to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully,
p104
aVyou need long stretches of uninterrupted time.
p105
aVAnd even though the work day is typically eight hours,
p106
aVhow many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office?
p107
aVHow about seven hours?
p108
aVSix? Five? Four?
p109
aVWhen's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office?
p110
aVTwo hours? One, maybe?
p111
aVVery, very few people actually have
p112
aVlong stretches of uninterrupted time at an office.
p113
aVAnd this is why people choose to do work at home,
p114
aVor they might go to the office,
p115
aVbut they might go to the office really early in the day,
p116
aVor late at night when no one's around,
p117
aVor they stick around after everyone's left,
p118
aVor go in on the weekends,
p119
aVor they get work done on the plane, in the car or in the train,
p120
aVbecause there are no distractions.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow there are different kinds of distractions,
p123
aVbut not the really bad distractions, which I'll talk about in a minute.
p124
aVAnd this whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done
p125
aVreminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted,
p126
aVand that is sleep.
p127
aVI think that sleep and work are very closely related \u2014
p128
aVnot because you can work while you're sleeping and sleep while you're working.
p129
aVThat's not really what I mean.
p130
aVI'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phase-based,
p131
aVor stage-based, events.
p132
aVSleep is about sleep phases, or stages \u2014 some people call them different things.
p133
aVThere are five of them, and in order to get to the really deep ones,
p134
aVthe meaningful ones, you have to go through the early ones.
p135
aVIf you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones \u2014
p136
aVif someone bumps you in bed, or there's a sound, or whatever happens \u2014
p137
aVyou don't just pick up where you left off.
p138
aa(lp139
VIf you're interrupted and woken up,
p140
aVyou have to start again.
p141
aVSo you have to go back a few phases and start again.
p142
aVAnd what ends up happening \u2014 you might have days like this
p143
aVwhere you wake up at eight or seven in the morning, or whenever you get up,
p144
aVand you're like, "I didn't sleep very well.
p145
aVI did the sleep thing \u2014 I went to bed, I laid down,
p146
aVbut I didn't really sleep."
p147
aVPeople say you go "to" sleep,
p148
aVbut you don't go to sleep, you go towards sleep; it takes a while.
p149
aVYou've got to go through phases and stuff,
p150
aVand if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well.
p151
aVSo does anyone here expect someone to sleep well
p152
aVif they're interrupted all night?
p153
aVI don't think anyone would say yes.
p154
aVWhy do we expect people to work well
p155
aVif they're being interrupted all day at the office?
p156
aVHow can we possibly expect people to do their job
p157
aVif they go to the office and are interrupted?
p158
aVThat doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense, to me.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo what are the interruptions that happen at the office but not at other places?
p161
aVBecause in other places, you can have interruptions like the TV,
p162
aVor you could go for a walk, or there's a fridge downstairs,
p163
aVor you've got your own couch, or whatever you want to do.
p164
aVIf you talk to certain managers, they'll tell you
p165
aVthat they don't want their employees to work at home
p166
aVbecause of these distractions.
p167
aVThey'll sometimes also say,
p168
aV"If I can't see the person, how do I know they're working?"
p169
aVwhich is ridiculous, but that's one of the excuses that managers give.
p170
aVAnd I'm one of these managers. I understand. I know how this goes.
p171
aVWe all have to improve on this sort of thing.
p172
aVBut oftentimes they'll cite distractions:
p173
aV"I can't let someone work at home.
p174
aVThey'll watch TV, or do this other thing."
p175
aVIt turns out those aren't the things that are distracting,
p176
aVBecause those are voluntary distractions.
p177
aVYou decide when you want to be distracted by the TV,
p178
aVwhen you want to turn something on,
p179
aVor when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk.
p180
aVAt the office,
p181
aVmost of the interruptions and distractions
p182
aVthat really cause people not to get work done are involuntary.
p183
aVSo let's go through a couple of those.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow, managers and bosses will often have you think
p186
aVthat the real distractions at work
p187
aVare things like Facebook and Twitter
p188
aVand YouTube and other websites,
p189
aVand in fact, they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work.
p190
aVSome of you may work at places where you can't get to certain sites.
p191
aVI mean, is this China? What the hell is going on here?
p192
aVYou can't go to a website at work, and that's the problem?
p193
aVThat's why people aren't getting work done,
p194
aVbecause they're on Facebook and Twitter?
p195
aVThat's kind of ridiculous. It's a total decoy.
p196
aVToday's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,
p197
aVthese things are just modern-day smoke breaks.
p198
aVNo one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago,
p199
aVso why does anyone care if someone goes to Facebook
p200
aVor Twitter or YouTube here and there?
p201
aVThose aren't the real problems in the office.
p202
aa(lp203
VThe real problems are what I like to call the M&Ms,
p204
aVthe Managers and the Meetings.
p205
aVThose are the real problems in the modern office today.
p206
aVAnd this is why things don't get done at work,
p207
aVit's because of the M&Ms.
p208
aVNow what's interesting is,
p209
aVif you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work,
p210
aVlike at home, in the car, on a plane, late at night, or early in the morning,
p211
aVyou don't find managers and meetings.
p212
aVYou find a lot of other distractions, but not managers and meetings.
p213
aVSo these are the things that you don't find elsewhere,
p214
aVbut you do find at the office.
p215
aVAnd managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people.
p216
aVThat's pretty much what managers are for. They're for interrupting people.
p217
aVThey don't really do the work, so they make sure everyone else is doing work,
p218
aVwhich is an interruption.
p219
aVWe have lots of managers in the world now, and a lot of people in the world,
p220
aVand a lot of interruptions by these managers.
p221
aVThey have to check in: "Hey, how's it going?
p222
aVShow me what's up." This sort of thing.
p223
aVThey keep interrupting you at the wrong time,
p224
aVwhile you're actually trying to do something they're paying you to do,
p225
aVthey tend to interrupt you.
p226
aVThat's kind of bad.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all,
p229
aVwhich is call meetings.
p230
aVAnd meetings are just toxic,
p231
aVterrible, poisonous things
p232
aVduring the day at work.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VWe all know this to be true,
p237
aVand you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees.
p238
aVIt doesn't work that way.
p239
aVThe manager calls the meeting
p240
aVso the employees can all come together,
p241
aVand it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people \u2014
p242
aVto say, "Hey look,
p243
aVwe're going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting.
p244
aVI don't care what you're doing,
p245
aVyou've got to stop doing it, so you can have this meeting."
p246
aVI mean, what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop?
p247
aVWhat if they're thinking about something important, or doing important work?
p248
aVAll of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else.
p249
aVSo they go into a meeting room, they get together,
p250
aVand they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter, usually.
p251
aVBecause meetings aren't work.
p252
aVMeetings are places to go to talk about things
p253
aVyou're supposed to be doing later.
p254
aa(lp255
VBut meetings also procreate.
p256
aVSo one meeting tends to lead to another meeting,
p257
aVwhich leads to another meeting.
p258
aVThere's often too many people in the meetings,
p259
aVand they're very, very expensive to the organization.
p260
aVCompanies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting,
p261
aVbut that's not true, unless there's only one person.
p262
aVIf there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting.
p263
aVIt's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization
p264
aVto have this one-hour meeting, which probably should have been handled
p265
aVby two or three people talking for a few minutes.
p266
aVBut instead, there's a long scheduled meeting,
p267
aVbecause meetings are scheduled the way software works,
p268
aVwhich is in increments of 15 minutes, or 30 minutes, or an hour.
p269
aVYou don't schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook; you can't.
p270
aVYou can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour.
p271
aVAnd so we tend to fill these times up
p272
aVwhen things should go really quickly.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today,
p275
aVespecially at offices.
p276
aVThese things don't exist outside of the office.
p277
aVSo I have some suggestions to remedy the situation.
p278
aVWhat can managers do \u2014
p279
aVenlightened managers, hopefully \u2014
p280
aVwhat can they do to make the office a better place for people to work,
p281
aVso it's not the last resort, but it's the first resort,
p282
aVso that people start to say,
p283
aV"When I really want to get stuff done, I go to the office."
p284
aVBecause the offices are well-equipped;
p285
aVeverything is there for them to do the work.
p286
aVBut they don't want to go there right now, so how do we change that?
p287
aVI have three suggestions to share with you.
p288
aVI have about three minutes, so that'll fit perfectly.
p289
aa(lp290
VWe've all heard of the Casual Friday thing.
p291
aVI don't know if people still do that.
p292
aVBut how about "No-talk Thursdays?"
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VPick one Thursday once a month,
p297
aVand cut it in half, just the afternoon \u2014 I'll make it easy for you.
p298
aVSo just the afternoon, one Thursday.
p299
aVFirst Thursday of the month, just the afternoon,
p300
aVnobody in the office can talk to each other.
p301
aVJust silence, that's it.
p302
aVAnd what you'll find
p303
aVis that a tremendous amount of work gets done
p304
aVwhen no one talks to each other.
p305
aVThis is when people actually get stuff done,
p306
aVis when no one's bothering them or interrupting them.
p307
aVGiving someone four hours of uninterrupted time
p308
aVis the best gift you can give anybody at work.
p309
aVIt's better than a computer,
p310
aVbetter than a new monitor, better than new software,
p311
aVor whatever people typically use.
p312
aVGiving them four hours of quiet time at the office
p313
aVis going to be incredibly valuable.
p314
aVIf you try that, I think you'll agree, and hopefully you can do it more often.
p315
aVSo maybe it's every other week,
p316
aVor every week, once a week,
p317
aVafternoons no one can talk to each other.
p318
aVThat's something that you'll find will really, really work.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnother thing you can try,
p321
aVis switching from active communication and collaboration,
p322
aVwhich is like face-to-face stuff \u2014 tapping people on the shoulder,
p323
aVsaying hi to them, having meetings,
p324
aVand replace that with more passive models of communication,
p325
aVusing things like email and instant messaging,
p326
aVor collaboration products, things like that.
p327
aVNow some people might say email is really distracting,
p328
aVI.M. is really distracting, and these other things are really distracting,
p329
aVbut they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing.
p330
aVYou can quit the email app; you can't quit your boss.
p331
aVYou can quit I.M.;
p332
aVyou can't hide your manager.
p333
aVYou can put these things away,
p334
aVand then you can be interrupted on your own schedule, at your own time,
p335
aVwhen you're available, when you're ready to go again.
p336
aVBecause work, like sleep, happens in phases.
p337
aVSo you'll be going up, doing some work,
p338
aVand then you'll come down from that work,
p339
aVand then maybe it's time to check that email or I.M.
p340
aVThere are very, very few things that are that urgent,
p341
aVthat need to happen, that need to be answered right this second.
p342
aVSo if you're a manager,
p343
aVstart encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email
p344
aVand other things that someone can put away
p345
aVand then get back to you on their own schedule.
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd the last suggestion I have is that,
p348
aVif you do have a meeting coming up,
p349
aVif you have the power, just cancel it.
p350
aVJust cancel that next meeting.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VToday's Friday, usually people have meetings on Monday.
p355
aVJust don't have it.
p356
aVI don't mean move it;
p357
aVI mean just erase it from memory, it's gone.
p358
aVAnd you'll find out that everything will be just fine.
p359
aVAll these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make
p360
aVat this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,
p361
aVjust forget about them, and things will be fine.
p362
aVPeople will have a more open morning, they can actually think.
p363
aVYou'll find out all these things you thought you had to do,
p364
aVyou don't actually have to do.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about.
p367
aVI hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough
p368
aVfor managers and bosses and business owners
p369
aVand organizers and people who are in charge of other people,
p370
aVto think about laying off a little bit,
p371
aVand giving people more time to get work done.
p372
aVI think it'll all pay off in the end.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo, thanks for listening.

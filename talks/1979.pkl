VWow, this is bright.
p5
aVIt must use a lot of power.
p6
aVWell, flying you all in here
p7
aVmust have cost a bit of energy too.
p8
aVSo the whole planet needs a lot of energy,
p9
aVand so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel.
p10
aVWe've been burning gas.
p11
aVIt's been a good run.
p12
aVIt got us to where we are, but we have to stop.
p13
aVWe can't do that anymore.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo we are trying different types of energy now,
p16
aValternative energy,
p17
aVbut it proved quite difficult to find something
p18
aVthat's as convenient and as cost-effective
p19
aVas oil, gas and coal.
p20
aVMy personal favorite is nuclear energy.
p21
aVNow, it's very energy-dense,
p22
aVit produces solid, reliable power,
p23
aVand it doesn't make any CO2.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow we know of two ways
p26
aVof making nuclear energy: fission and fusion.
p27
aVNow in fission, you take a big nucleus,
p28
aVyou break it in part, in two,
p29
aVand it makes lots of energy,
p30
aVand this is how the nuclear reactor today works.
p31
aVIt works pretty good.
p32
aVAnd then there's fusion.
p33
aVNow, I like fusion. Fusion's much better.
p34
aVSo you take two small nuclei,
p35
aVyou put it together, and you make helium,
p36
aVand that's very nice.
p37
aVIt makes lots of energy.
p38
aVThis is nature's way of producing energy.
p39
aVThe sun and all the stars in the universe
p40
aVrun on fusion.
p41
aVNow, a fusion plant
p42
aVwould actually be quite cost-effective
p43
aVand it also would be quite safe.
p44
aVIt only produces short term radioactive waste,
p45
aVand it cannot melt down.
p46
aVNow, the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean.
p47
aVIn the ocean, you can extract the fuel
p48
aVfor about one thousandth of a cent
p49
aVper kilowatt-hour, so that's very, very cheap.
p50
aVAnd if the whole planet would run on fusion,
p51
aVwe could extract the fuel from the ocean.
p52
aVIt would run for billions and billions of years.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, if fusion is so great, why don't we have it?
p55
aVWhere is it?
p56
aVWell, there's always a bit of a catch.
p57
aVFusion is really, really hard to do.
p58
aVSo the problem is, those two nuclei,
p59
aVthey are both positively charged,
p60
aVso they don't want to fuse.
p61
aVThey go like this. They go like that.
p62
aVSo in order to make them fuse,
p63
aVyou have to throw them at each other with great speed,
p64
aVand if they have enough speed,
p65
aVthey will go against the repulsion,
p66
aVthey will touch, and they will make energy.
p67
aVNow, the particle speed
p68
aVis a measure of the temperature.
p69
aVSo the temperature required for fusion
p70
aVis 150 billion degrees C.
p71
aVThis is rather warm,
p72
aVand this is why fusion is so hard to do.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, I caught my little fusion bug
p75
aVwhen I did my Ph.D. here at the University of British Columbia,
p76
aVand then I got a big job in a laser printer place
p77
aVmaking printing for the printing industry.
p78
aVI worked there for 10 years,
p79
aVand I got a little bit bored,
p80
aVand then I was 40, and I got a mid-life crisis,
p81
aVyou know, the usual thing:
p82
aVWho am I? What should I do?
p83
aVWhat should I do? What can I do?
p84
aVAnd then I was looking at my good work,
p85
aVand what I was doing is I was cutting the forests
p86
aVaround here in B.C.
p87
aVand burying you, all of you,
p88
aVin millions of tons of junk mail.
p89
aVNow, that was not very satisfactory.
p90
aVSo some people buy a Porsche.
p91
aVOthers get a mistress.
p92
aVBut I've decided to get my bit
p93
aVto solve global warming and make fusion happen.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, so the first thing I did
p96
aVis I looked into the literature and I see,
p97
aVhow does fusion work?
p98
aVSo the physicists have been working on fusion for a while,
p99
aVand one of the ways they do it
p100
aVis with something called a tokamak.
p101
aVIt's a big ring of magnetic coil,
p102
aVsuperconducting coil,
p103
aVand it makes a magnetic field
p104
aVin a ring like this,
p105
aVand the hot gas in the middle,
p106
aVwhich is called a plasma, is trapped.
p107
aVThe particles go round and round and round
p108
aVthe circle at the wall.
p109
aVThen they throw a huge amount of heat in there
p110
aVto try to cook that to fusion temperature.
p111
aVSo this is the inside of one of those donuts,
p112
aVand on the right side you can see
p113
aVthe fusion plasma in there.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, a second way of doing this
p116
aVis by using laser fusion.
p117
aVNow in laser fusion, you have a little ping pong ball,
p118
aVyou put the fusion fuel in the center,
p119
aVand you zap that with a whole bunch of laser around it.
p120
aVThe lasers are very strong, and it squashes
p121
aVthe ping pong ball really, really quick.
p122
aVAnd if you squeeze something hard enough,
p123
aVit gets hotter,
p124
aVand if it gets really, really fast,
p125
aVand they do that in one billionth of a second,
p126
aVit makes enough energy and enough heat
p127
aVto make fusion.
p128
aVSo this is the inside of one such machine.
p129
aVYou see the laser beam and the pellet
p130
aVin the center.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, most people think that fusion is going nowhere.
p133
aVThey always think that the physicists are in their lab
p134
aVand they're working hard, but nothing is happening.
p135
aVThat's actually not quite true.
p136
aVThis is a curve of the gain in fusion
p137
aVover the last 30 years or so,
p138
aVand you can see that we're making now
p139
aVabout 10,000 times more fusion than we used to
p140
aVwhen we started.
p141
aVThat's a pretty good gain.
p142
aVAs a matter of fact, it's as fast
p143
aVas the fabled Moore's Law
p144
aVthat defined the amount of transistors
p145
aVthey can put on a chip.
p146
aVNow, this dot here is called JET,
p147
aVthe Joint European Torus.
p148
aVIt's a big tokamak donut in Europe,
p149
aVand this machine in 1997
p150
aVproduced 16 megawatts of fusion power
p151
aVwith 17 megawatts of heat.
p152
aVNow, you say, that's not much use,
p153
aVbut it's actually pretty close,
p154
aVconsidering we can get
p155
aVabout 10,000 times more than we started.
p156
aVThe second dot here is the NIF.
p157
aVIt's the National Ignition Facility.
p158
aVIt's a big laser machine in the U.S.,
p159
aVand last month they announced
p160
aVwith quite a bit of noise
p161
aVthat they had managed to make more fusion energy
p162
aVfrom the fusion
p163
aVthan the energy that they put in  the center of the ping pong ball.
p164
aVNow, that's not quite good enough,
p165
aVbecause the laser to put that energy in
p166
aVwas more energy than that,
p167
aVbut it was pretty good.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow this is ITER,
p170
aVpronounced in French: EE-tairh.
p171
aVSo this is a big collaboration of different countries
p172
aVthat are building a huge magnetic donut
p173
aVin the south of France,
p174
aVand this machine, when it's finished,
p175
aVwill produce 500 megawatts of fusion power
p176
aVwith only 50 megawatts to make it.
p177
aVSo this one is the real one.
p178
aVIt's going to work.
p179
aVThat's the kind of machine that makes energy.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow if you look at the graph, you will notice
p182
aVthat those two dots are a little bit
p183
aVon the right of the curve.
p184
aVWe kind of have fallen off the progress.
p185
aVActually, the science to make those machines
p186
aVwas really in time
p187
aVto produce fusion during that curve.
p188
aVHowever, there has been a bit of politics going on,
p189
aVand the will to do it was not there,
p190
aVso it drifted to the right.
p191
aVITER, for example, could have been built
p192
aVin 2000 or 2005,
p193
aVbut because it's a big international collaboration,
p194
aVthe politics got in and it delayed it a bit.
p195
aVFor example, it took them about three years
p196
aVto decide where to put it.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, fusion is often criticized
p199
aVfor being a little too expensive.
p200
aVYes, it did cost
p201
aVa billion dollars or two billion dollars a year
p202
aVto make this progress.
p203
aVBut you have to compare that to the cost
p204
aVof making Moore's Law.
p205
aVThat cost way more than that.
p206
aVThe result of Moore's Law
p207
aVis this cell phone here in my pocket.
p208
aVThis cell phone, and the Internet behind it,
p209
aVcost about one trillion dollars,
p210
aVjust so I can take a selfie
p211
aVand put it on Facebook.
p212
aVThen when my dad sees that,
p213
aVhe'll be very proud.
p214
aVWe also spend about 650 billion dollars a year
p215
aVin subsidies for oil and gas
p216
aVand renewable energy.
p217
aVNow, we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion.
p218
aVSo me, personally, I don't think it's too expensive.
p219
aVI think it's actually been shortchanged,
p220
aVconsidering it can solve all our energy problems
p221
aVcleanly for the next couple of billions of years.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow I can say that, but I'm a little bit biased,
p224
aVbecause I started a fusion company
p225
aVand I don't even have a Facebook account.
p226
aVSo when I started this fusion company in 2002,
p227
aVI knew I couldn't fight with the big lads.
p228
aVThey had much more resources than me.
p229
aVSo I decided I would need to find a solution
p230
aVthat is cheaper and faster.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow magnetic and laser fusion
p233
aVare pretty good machines.
p234
aVThey are awesome pieces of technology,
p235
aVwonderful machines, and they have shown
p236
aVthat fusion can be done.
p237
aVHowever, as a power plant,
p238
aVI don't think they're very good.
p239
aVThey're way too big, way too complicated,
p240
aVway too expensive,
p241
aVand also, they don't deal very much
p242
aVwith the fusion energy.
p243
aVWhen you make fusion, the energy comes out
p244
aVas neutrons, fast neutrons comes out of the plasma.
p245
aVThose neutrons hit the wall of the machine.
p246
aVIt damages it.
p247
aVAnd also, you have to catch the heat from those neutrons
p248
aVand run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere,
p249
aVand on those machines,
p250
aVit was all a bit of an afterthought.
p251
aVSo I decided that surely there is a better way of doing that.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo back to the literature,
p254
aVand I read about the fusion everywhere.
p255
aVOne way in particular attracted my attention,
p256
aVand it's called magnetized target fusion,
p257
aVor MTF for short.
p258
aVNow, in MTF, what you want to do
p259
aVis you take a big vat
p260
aVand you fill that with liquid metal,
p261
aVand you spin the liquid metal
p262
aVto open a vortex in the center,
p263
aVa bit like your sink.
p264
aVWhen you pull the plug on a sink, it makes a vortex.
p265
aVAnd then you have some pistons driven by pressure
p266
aVthat goes on the outside,
p267
aVand this compresses the liquid metal
p268
aVaround the plasma, and it compresses it,
p269
aVit gets hotter, like a laser,
p270
aVand then it makes fusion.
p271
aVSo it's a bit of a mix
p272
aVbetween a magnetized fusion
p273
aVand the laser fusion.
p274
aVSo those have a couple of very good advantages.
p275
aVThe liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons
p276
aVand no neutrons hit the wall,
p277
aVand therefore there's no damage to the machine.
p278
aVThe liquid metal gets hot,
p279
aVso you can pump that in a heat exchanger,
p280
aVmake some steam, spin a turbine.
p281
aVSo that's a very convenient way of doing
p282
aVthis part of the process.
p283
aVAnd finally, all the energy to make the fusion happen
p284
aVcomes from steam-powered pistons,
p285
aVwhich is way cheaper than lasers
p286
aVor superconducting coils.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow, this was all very good
p289
aVexcept for the problem that it didn't quite work.
p290
aV(Laughter)
p291
aVThere's always a catch.
p292
aVSo when you compress that,
p293
aVthe plasma cools down
p294
aVfaster than the compression speed,
p295
aVso you're trying to compress it,
p296
aVbut the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down
p297
aVand then it did absolutely nothing.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo when I saw that, I said, well, this is such a shame,
p300
aVbecause it's a very, very good idea.
p301
aVSo hopefully I can improve on that.
p302
aVSo I thought about it for a minute,
p303
aVand I said, okay, how can we make that work better?
p304
aVSo then I thought about impact.
p305
aVWhat about if we use a big hammer
p306
aVand we swing it and we hit the nail like this,
p307
aVin the place of putting the hammer on the nail
p308
aVand pushing and try to put it in? That won't work.
p309
aVSo what the idea is
p310
aVis to use the idea of an impact.
p311
aVSo we accelerate the pistons with steam,
p312
aVthat takes a little bit of time,
p313
aVbut then, bang! you hit the piston,
p314
aVand, baff!, all the energy is done instantly,
p315
aVdown instantly to the liquid,
p316
aVand that compresses the plasma much faster.
p317
aVSo I decided, okay, this is good, let's make that.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo we built this machine in this garage here.
p320
aVWe made a small machine
p321
aVthat we managed to squeeze
p322
aVa little bit of neutrons out of that,
p323
aVand those are my marketing neutrons,
p324
aVand with those marketing neutrons,
p325
aVthen I raised about 50 million dollars,
p326
aVand I hired 65 people. That's my team here.
p327
aVAnd this is what we want to build.
p328
aVSo it's going to be a big machine,
p329
aVabout three meters in diameter,
p330
aVliquid lead spinning around,
p331
aVbig vortex in the center,
p332
aVput the plasma on the top and on the bottom,
p333
aVpiston hits on the side,
p334
aVbang!, it compresses it,
p335
aVand it will make some energy,
p336
aVand the neutron will come out in the liquid metal,
p337
aVgoing to go in a steam engine and make the turbine,
p338
aVand some of the steam will go back
p339
aVto fire the piston.
p340
aVWe're going to run that about one time per second,
p341
aVand it will produce 100 megawatts of electricity.
p342
aa(lp343
VOkay, we also built this injector,
p344
aVso this injector makes the plasma to start with.
p345
aVIt makes the plasma at about
p346
aVa lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C.
p347
aVUnfortunately, it doesn't last quite long enough,
p348
aVso we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit,
p349
aVbut last month it got a lot better,
p350
aVso I think we have the plasma compressing now.
p351
aVThen we built a small sphere, about this big,
p352
aV14 pistons around it,
p353
aVand this will compress the liquid.
p354
aVHowever, plasma is difficult to compress.
p355
aVWhen you compress it,
p356
aVit tends to go a little bit crooked like that,
p357
aVso you need the timing of the piston
p358
aVto be very good,
p359
aVand for that we use several control systems,
p360
aVwhich was not possible in 1970,
p361
aVbut we now can do that
p362
aVwith nice, new electronics.
p363
aa(lp364
VSo finally, most people think that fusion
p365
aVis in the future and will never happen,
p366
aVbut as a matter of fact, fusion is getting very close.
p367
aVWe are almost there.
p368
aVThe big labs have shown that fusion is doable,
p369
aVand now there are small companies that are thinking about that,
p370
aVand they say, it's not that it cannot be done,
p371
aVbut it's how to make it cost-effectively.
p372
aVGeneral Fusion is one of those small companies,
p373
aVand hopefully, very soon, somebody, someone,
p374
aVwill crack that nut,
p375
aVand perhaps it will be General Fusion.
p376
aa(lp377
VThank you very much.

Inside a spherical chamber, molten lead-lithium is spun up into a vortex, then shot with a pulse of magnetically contained plasma -- meanwhile, around the edge of the sphere, an array of pistons will drive a pressure wave into the center of the sphere, compressing the plasma to fusion conditions.

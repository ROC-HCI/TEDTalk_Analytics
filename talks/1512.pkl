VWell, I was born with a rare visual condition
p5
aVcalled achromatopsia, which is total color blindness,
p6
aVso I've never seen color,
p7
aVand I don't know what color looks like,
p8
aVbecause I come from a grayscale world.
p9
aVTo me, the sky is always gray,
p10
aVflowers are always gray,
p11
aVand television is still in black and white.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut, since the age of 21,
p14
aVinstead of seeing color, I can hear color.
p15
aVIn 2003, I started a project
p16
aVwith computer scientist Adam Montandon,
p17
aVand the result, with further collaborations
p18
aVwith Peter Kese from Slovenia
p19
aVand Matias Lizana from Barcelona,
p20
aVis this electronic eye.
p21
aVIt's a color sensor that detects
p22
aVthe color frequency in front of me \u2014 (Frequency sounds) \u2014
p23
aVand sends this frequency to a chip installed
p24
aVat the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me
p25
aVthrough the bone, through bone conduction.
p26
aV(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like \u2014
p27
aVThis is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds)
p28
aVFor example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds)
p29
aVThis is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds)
p30
aVThis is the sound of a dirty sock. (Laughter)
p31
aVWhich is like yellow, this one.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo I've been hearing color all the time for eight years,
p34
aVsince 2004, so I find it completely normal now
p35
aVto hear color all the time.
p36
aVAt the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give
p37
aVfor each color, so I had to memorize the notes,
p38
aVbut after some time, all this information
p39
aVbecame a perception.
p40
aVI didn't have to think about the notes.
p41
aVAnd after some time, this perception became a feeling.
p42
aVI started to have favorite colors,
p43
aVand I started to dream in colors.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, when I started to dream in color is when I felt
p46
aVthat the software and my brain had united,
p47
aVbecause in my dreams, it was my brain creating
p48
aVelectronic sounds. It wasn't the software,
p49
aVso that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.
p50
aVIt's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device
p51
aVwas no longer a device.
p52
aVIt had become a part of my body,
p53
aVan extension of my senses,
p54
aVand after some time, it even became a part
p55
aVof my official image.
p56
aa(lp57
VThis is my passport from 2004.
p58
aVYou're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports
p59
aVwith electronic equipment, but I insisted
p60
aVto the passport office that what they were seeing
p61
aVwas actually a new part of my body,
p62
aVan extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me
p63
aVto appear with the passport photo.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, life has changed dramatically since I hear color,
p66
aVbecause color is almost everywhere,
p67
aVso the biggest change for example is
p68
aVgoing to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso,
p69
aVfor example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall,
p70
aVbecause I can listen to the paintings.
p71
aVAnd supermarkets, I find this is very shocking,
p72
aVit's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.
p73
aVIt's like going to a nightclub.
p74
aVIt's full of different melodies. (Laughter) Yeah.
p75
aVEspecially the aisle with cleaning products.
p76
aVIt's just fabulous. (Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VAlso, the way I dress has changed.
p79
aVBefore, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.
p80
aVNow I dress in a way that it sounds good. (Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
V(Applause)
p83
aa(lp84
VSo today I'm dressed in C major,
p85
aVso it's quite a happy chord. (Laughter)
p86
aVIf I had to go to a funeral, though,
p87
aVI would dress in B minor, which would be
p88
aVturquoise, purple and orange. (Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VAlso, food, the way I look at food has changed,
p91
aVbecause now I can display the food on a plate,
p92
aVso I can eat my favorite song. (Laughter)
p93
aVSo depending on how I display it,
p94
aVI can hear and I can compose music with food.
p95
aVSo imagine a restaurant where we can have, like,
p96
aVLady Gaga salads as starters. (Laughter) I mean,
p97
aVthis would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.
p98
aVAnd also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos
p99
aVas main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts,
p100
aVthat would be a very exciting restaurant
p101
aVwhere you can actually eat songs.
p102
aa(lp103
VAlso, the way I perceive beauty has changed,
p104
aVbecause when I look at someone, I hear their face,
p105
aVso someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.
p106
aV(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite,
p107
aVthe other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like,
p108
aVsound portraits of people.
p109
aVInstead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape,
p110
aVI point at them with the eye and I write down
p111
aVthe different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.
p112
aVHere's some faces.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Musical chords)
p115
aa(lp116
VYeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. (Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VSome people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.
p119
aVPrince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.
p120
aVThey have similar sound of eyes.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo you relate people that you wouldn't relate,
p123
aVand you can actually also create concerts
p124
aVby looking at the audience faces.
p125
aVSo I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.
p126
aVThe good thing about this is,
p127
aVif the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.
p128
aVIt's not my fault, because \u2014 (Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd so another thing that happens is that
p131
aVI started having this secondary effect
p132
aVthat normal sounds started to become color.
p133
aVI heard a telephone tone, and it felt green
p134
aVbecause it sounded just like the color green.
p135
aVThe BBC beeps, they sound turquoise,
p136
aVand listening to Mozart became a yellow experience,
p137
aa(lp138
Vso I started to paint music and paint people's voices,
p139
aVbecause people's voices have frequencies
p140
aVthat I relate to color.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd here's some music translated into color.
p143
aVFor example, Mozart, "Queen of the Night," looks like this.
p144
aV(Music) Very yellow and very colorful,
p145
aVbecause there's many different frequencies.
p146
aV(Music)
p147
aVAnd this is a completely different song.
p148
aV(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby." (Laughter)
p149
aV(Music)
p150
aVIt is very pink and very yellow.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo, also voices, I can transform speeches into color,
p153
aVfor example, these are two very well-known speeches.
p154
aVOne of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream,"
p155
aVand the other one is Hitler.
p156
aVAnd I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls
p157
aVwithout labels, and then I ask people,
p158
aV"Which one do you prefer?"
p159
aVAnd most people change their preference
p160
aVwhen I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler
p161
aVand the one on the right is Martin Luther King.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors,
p164
aVjust like human vision.
p165
aVI was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.
p166
aVBut then, I just thought that
p167
aVthis human vision wasn't good enough.
p168
aVThere's many, many more colors around us
p169
aVthat we cannot perceive,
p170
aVbut that electronic eyes can perceive.
p171
aVSo I decided to continue extending my color senses,
p172
aVand I added infrared and I added ultraviolet
p173
aVto the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors
p174
aVthat the human eye cannot perceive.
p175
aa(lp176
VFor example, perceiving infrared is good because you can
p177
aVactually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.
p178
aVI can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.
p179
aVAnd the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that
p180
aVyou can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe,
p181
aVbecause ultraviolet is a dangerous color,
p182
aVa color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish
p183
aVto perceive things that we cannot perceive.
p184
aa(lp185
VThat's why, two years ago,
p186
aVI created the Cyborg Foundation,
p187
aVwhich is a foundation that tries to help people
p188
aVbecome a cyborg, tries to encourage people
p189
aVto extend their senses
p190
aVby using technology as part of the body.
p191
aa(lp192
VWe should all think that knowledge comes from our senses,
p193
aVso if we extend our senses,
p194
aVwe will consequently extend our knowledge.
p195
aVI think life will be much more exciting
p196
aVwhen we stop creating applications for mobile phones
p197
aVand we start creating applications for our own body.
p198
aVI think this will be a big, big change
p199
aVthat we will see during this century.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo I do encourage you all to think about which senses
p202
aVyou'd like to extend.
p203
aVI would encourage you to become a cyborg.
p204
aVYou won't be alone. Thank you. (Applause)

VI'm going to ask and try to answer,
p5
aVin some ways, kind of an uncomfortable question.
p6
aVBoth civilians, obviously, and soldiers
p7
aVsuffer in war;
p8
aVI don't think any civilian has ever missed
p9
aVthe war that they were subjected to.
p10
aVI've been covering wars for almost 20 years,
p11
aVand one of the remarkable things for me
p12
aVis how many soldiers find themselves missing it.
p13
aVHow is it someone can go through
p14
aVthe worst experience imaginable,
p15
aVand come home, back to their home,
p16
aVand their family, their country, and miss the war?
p17
aVHow does that work? What does it mean?
p18
aVWe have to answer that question,
p19
aVbecause if we don't, it'll be impossible
p20
aVto bring soldiers back
p21
aVto a place in society where they belong,
p22
aVand I think it'll also be impossible to stop war,
p23
aVif we don't understand how that mechanism works.
p24
aa(lp25
VThe problem is that war
p26
aVdoes not have a simple, neat truth,
p27
aVone simple, neat truth.
p28
aa(lp29
VAny sane person hates war,
p30
aVhates the idea of war,
p31
aVwouldn't want to have anything to do with it,
p32
aVdoesn't want to be near it, doesn't want to know about it.
p33
aVThat's a sane response to war.
p34
aVBut if I asked all of you in this room,
p35
aVwho here has paid money
p36
aVto go to a cinema
p37
aVand be entertained by a Hollywood war movie,
p38
aVmost of you would probably raise your hands.
p39
aVThat's what's so complicated about war.
p40
aVAnd trust me, if a room full of peace-loving people
p41
aVfinds something compelling about war,
p42
aVso do 20-year-old soldiers
p43
aVwho have been trained in it, I promise you.
p44
aVThat's the thing that has to be understood.
p45
aa(lp46
VI've covered war for about 20 years, as I said,
p47
aVbut my most intense experiences in combat
p48
aVwere with American soldiers in Afghanistan.
p49
aVI've been in Africa, the Middle East,
p50
aVAfghanistan in the '90s,
p51
aVbut it was with American soldiers in 2007, 2008,
p52
aVthat I was confronted with
p53
aVvery intense combat.
p54
aVI was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley
p55
aVin eastern Afghanistan.
p56
aVIt was six miles long.
p57
aVThere were 150 men of Battle Company in that valley,
p58
aVand for a while, while I was there,
p59
aValmost 20 percent of all the combat
p60
aVin all of Afghanistan was happening
p61
aVin those six miles.
p62
aVA hundred and fifty men were absorbing
p63
aValmost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces
p64
aVin the country, for a couple months.
p65
aVIt was very intense.
p66
aVI spent most of my time at a small outpost
p67
aVcalled Restrepo.
p68
aVIt was named after the platoon medic
p69
aVthat had been killed about two months into the deployment.
p70
aVIt was a few plywood B-huts
p71
aVclinging to a side of a ridge,
p72
aVand sandbags, bunkers, gun positions,
p73
aVand there were 20 men up there
p74
aVof Second Platoon, Battle Company.
p75
aVI spent most of my time up there.
p76
aVThere was no running water.
p77
aVThere was no way to bathe.
p78
aVThe guys were up there for a month at a time.
p79
aVThey never even got out of their clothes.
p80
aVThey fought. The worked.
p81
aVThey slept in the same clothes.
p82
aVThey never took them off, and at the end of the month,
p83
aVthey went back down to the company headquarters,
p84
aVand by then, their clothes were unwearable.
p85
aVThey burned them and got a new set.
p86
aVThere was no Internet. There was no phone.
p87
aVThere was no communication with the outside world up there.
p88
aVThere was no cooked food.
p89
aVThere was nothing up there
p90
aVthat young men typically like:
p91
aVno cars, no girls, no television, nothing
p92
aVexcept combat.
p93
aVCombat they did learn to like.
p94
aa(lp95
VI remember one day, it was a very hot day
p96
aVin the spring,
p97
aVand we hadn't been in a fight
p98
aVin a couple of weeks, maybe.
p99
aVUsually, the outpost was attacked,
p100
aVand we hadn't seen any combat in a couple of weeks,
p101
aVand everyone was just stunned
p102
aVwith boredom and heat.
p103
aVAnd I remember the lieutenant walking past me
p104
aVsort of stripped to the waist.
p105
aVIt was incredibly hot.
p106
aVStripped to the waist, walked past me muttering,
p107
aV"Oh God, please someone attack us today."
p108
aVThat's how bored they were.
p109
aVThat's war too, is a lieutenant saying,
p110
aV"Please make something happen
p111
aVbecause we're going crazy."
p112
aa(lp113
VTo understand that,
p114
aVyou have to, for a moment,
p115
aVthink about combat not morally \u2014
p116
aVthat's an important job to do \u2014
p117
aVbut for a moment, don't think about it morally,
p118
aVthink about it neurologically.
p119
aVLet's think about what happens in your brain
p120
aVwhen you're in combat.
p121
aVFirst of all, the experience
p122
aVis very bizarre, it's a very bizarre one.
p123
aVIt's not what I had expected.
p124
aVUsually, you're not scared.
p125
aVI've been very scared in combat,
p126
aVbut most of the time when I was out there,
p127
aVI wasn't scared.
p128
aVI was very scared beforehand
p129
aVand incredibly scared afterwards,
p130
aVand that fear that comes afterwards can last years.
p131
aVI haven't been shot at in six years,
p132
aVand I was woken up very abruptly this morning
p133
aVby a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft,
p134
aVsix years later.
p135
aVI've never even been strafed by aircraft,
p136
aVand I was having nightmares about it.
p137
aVTime slows down.
p138
aVYou get this weird tunnel vision.
p139
aVYou notice some details very, very, very accurately
p140
aVand other things drop out.
p141
aVIt's almost a slightly altered state of mind.
p142
aVWhat's happening in your brain
p143
aVis you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline
p144
aVpumped through your system.
p145
aVYoung men will go to great lengths
p146
aVto have that experience.
p147
aVIt's wired into us.
p148
aVIt's hormonally supported.
p149
aVThe mortality rate for young men in society
p150
aVis six times what it is for young women
p151
aVfrom violence and from accidents,
p152
aVjust the stupid stuff that young men do:
p153
aVjumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of,
p154
aVlighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire,
p155
aVI mean, you know what I'm talking about.
p156
aVThey die at six times the rate
p157
aVthat young women do.
p158
aVStatistically, you are safer as a teenage boy,
p159
aVyou would be safer in the fire department
p160
aVor the police department in most American cities
p161
aVthan just walking around the streets of your hometown
p162
aVlooking for something to do,
p163
aVstatistically.
p164
aa(lp165
VYou can imagine how that plays out in combat.
p166
aVAt Restrepo, every guy up there was almost killed,
p167
aVincluding me,
p168
aVincluding my good friend Tim Hetherington,
p169
aVwho was later killed in Libya.
p170
aVThere were guys walking around
p171
aVwith bullet holes in their uniforms,
p172
aVrounds that had cut through the fabric
p173
aVand didn't touch their bodies.
p174
aa(lp175
VI was leaning against some sandbags one morning,
p176
aVnot much going on, sort of spacing out,
p177
aVand some sand was kicked into the side of,
p178
aVsort of hit the side of my face.
p179
aVSomething hit the side of my face, and I didn't know what it was.
p180
aVYou have to understand about bullets
p181
aVthat they go a lot faster than sound,
p182
aVso if someone shoots at you
p183
aVfrom a few hundred meters,
p184
aVthe bullet goes by you, or hits you obviously,
p185
aVhalf a second or so before the sound catches up to it.
p186
aVSo I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face.
p187
aVHalf a second later, I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh.
p188
aVIt was machine gun fire.
p189
aVIt was the first round, the first burst
p190
aVof an hour-long firefight.
p191
aVWhat had happened was the bullet hit,
p192
aVa bullet hit three or four inches from the side of my head.
p193
aVImagine, just think about it, because I certainly did,
p194
aVthink about the angle of deviation that saved my life.
p195
aVAt 400 meters, it missed me by three inches.
p196
aVJust think about the math on that.
p197
aVEvery guy up there
p198
aVhad some experience like that,
p199
aVat least once, if not many times.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe boys are up there for a year.
p202
aVThey got back.
p203
aVSome of them got out of the Army
p204
aVand had tremendous psychological problems when they got home.
p205
aVSome of them stayed in the Army
p206
aVand were more or less okay, psychologically.
p207
aVI was particularly close to a guy named Brendan O'Byrne.
p208
aVI'm still very good friends with him.
p209
aVHe came back to the States. He got out of the Army.
p210
aVI had a dinner party one night.
p211
aVI invited him,
p212
aVand he started talking with a woman,
p213
aVone of my friends,
p214
aVand she knew how bad it had been out there,
p215
aVand she said, "Brendan,
p216
aVis there anything at all that you miss about
p217
aVbeing out in Afghanistan, about the war?"
p218
aVAnd he thought about it quite a long time,
p219
aVand finally he said, "Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."
p220
aVAnd he's one of the most traumatized people
p221
aVI've seen from that war.
p222
aV"Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."
p223
aa(lp224
VWhat is he talking about?
p225
aVHe's not a psychopath.
p226
aVHe doesn't miss killing people.
p227
aVHe's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at
p228
aVand seeing his friends get killed.
p229
aVWhat is it that he misses? We have to answer that.
p230
aVIf we're going to stop war, we have to answer that question.
p231
aa(lp232
VI think what he missed is brotherhood.
p233
aVHe missed, in some ways,
p234
aVthe opposite of killing.
p235
aVWhat he missed was connection
p236
aVto the other men he was with.
p237
aVNow, brotherhood is different from friendship.
p238
aVFriendship happens in society, obviously.
p239
aVThe more you like someone,
p240
aVthe more you'd be willing to do for them.
p241
aVBrotherhood has nothing to do
p242
aVwith how you feel about the other person.
p243
aVIt's a mutual agreement in a group
p244
aVthat you will put the welfare of the group,
p245
aVyou will put the safety of everyone in the group
p246
aVabove your own.
p247
aVIn effect, you're saying,
p248
aV"I love these other people more than I love myself."
p249
aa(lp250
VBrendan was a team leader
p251
aVin command of three men,
p252
aVand the worst day in Afghanistan \u2014
p253
aVHe was almost killed so many times.
p254
aVIt didn't bother him.
p255
aVThe worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan
p256
aVwas one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet
p257
aVin the helmet, knocked him over.
p258
aVThey thought he was dead.
p259
aVIt was in the middle of a huge firefight.
p260
aVNo one could deal with it, and a minute later,
p261
aVKyle Steiner sat back up
p262
aVfrom the dead, as it were,
p263
aVbecause he'd come back to consciousness.
p264
aVThe bullet had just knocked him out.
p265
aVIt glanced off the helmet.
p266
aVHe remembers people saying,
p267
aVas he was sort of half-conscious,
p268
aVhe remembers people saying,
p269
aV"Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead."
p270
aVAnd he was thinking, "I'm not dead."
p271
aVAnd he sat up.
p272
aVAnd Brendan realized after that
p273
aVthat he could not protect his men,
p274
aVand that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan,
p275
aVwas realizing that.
p276
aVThat's brotherhood.
p277
aa(lp278
VThis wasn't invented recently.
p279
aVMany of you have probably read "The Iliad."
p280
aVAchilles surely would have risked his life
p281
aVor given his life to save his friend Patroclus.
p282
aVIn World War II, there were many stories
p283
aVof soldiers who were wounded,
p284
aVwere brought to a rear base hospital,
p285
aVwho went AWOL,
p286
aVcrawled out of windows, slipped out doors,
p287
aVwent AWOL, wounded,
p288
aVto make their way back to the front lines
p289
aVto rejoin their brothers out there.
p290
aVSo you think about Brendan,
p291
aVyou think about all these soldiers
p292
aVhaving an experience like that, a bond like that,
p293
aVin a small group,
p294
aVwhere they loved 20 other people
p295
aVin some ways more than they loved themselves,
p296
aVyou think about how good that would feel, imagine it,
p297
aVand they are blessed with that experience for a year,
p298
aVand then they come home,
p299
aVand they are just back in society
p300
aVlike the rest of us are,
p301
aVnot knowing who they can count on,
p302
aVnot knowing who loves them, who they can love,
p303
aVnot knowing exactly what anyone they know
p304
aVwould do for them if it came down to it.
p305
aVThat is terrifying.
p306
aVCompared to that,
p307
aVwar, psychologically, in some ways, is easy,
p308
aVcompared to that kind of alienation.
p309
aVThat's why they miss it,
p310
aVand that's what we have to understand
p311
aVand in some ways fix in our society.
p312
aa(lp313
VThank you very much.

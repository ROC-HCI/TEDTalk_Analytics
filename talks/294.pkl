VMy search is always to find ways to chronicle,
p5
aVto share and to document stories about people, just everyday people.
p6
aVStories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence,
p7
aVbut that are never sentimental,
p8
aVthat never look away from the darkest things about us.
p9
aVBecause I really believe that we're never more beautiful
p10
aVthan when we're most ugly.
p11
aVBecause that's really the moment we really know what we're made of.
p12
aVAs Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria
p13
aVwith a whole generation \u2014 in the '80s \u2014
p14
aVof students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended.
p15
aVSo it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut what I've come to learn
p18
aVis that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures,
p19
aVbut in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion,
p20
aVeveryday acts of compassion.
p21
aVIn South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu.
p22
aVUbuntu comes out of a philosophy that says,
p23
aVthe only way for me to be human is for you to reflect
p24
aVmy humanity back at me.
p25
aVBut if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.
p26
aVI don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it
p27
aVuntil there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.
p28
aVThen suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good.
p29
aVIt's usually when I'm cussing in traffic
p30
aVat someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee
p31
aVand send emails and make notes.
p32
aVSo what Ubuntu really says
p33
aVis that there is no way for us to be human without other people.
p34
aVIt's really very simple, but really very complicated.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, I thought I should start with some stories.
p37
aVI should tell you some stories about remarkable people,
p38
aVso I thought I'd start with my mother.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVAnd she was dark, too.
p41
aVMy mother was English.
p42
aVMy parents met in Oxford in the '50s,
p43
aVand my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there.
p44
aVShe was five foot two, very feisty and very English.
p45
aVThis is how English my mother is \u2014 or was, she just passed.
p46
aVShe came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me,
p47
aVand we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVAnd then we went to a fish restaurant,
p50
aVand we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us,
p51
aVand he came up and my mother said,
p52
aV"Do you have any specials, young man?"
p53
aVAnd Chad says, "Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon,
p54
aVthat's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust.
p55
aVIt's totally rad."
p56
aVAnd my mother turned to me and said,
p57
aV"What language is he speaking?"
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVI said, "English, mum."
p60
aVAnd she shook her head and said,
p61
aV"Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language,
p62
aVwhy don't they use it?"
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, this woman, who converted from the Church of England
p66
aVto Catholicism when she married my father \u2014
p67
aVand there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert \u2014
p68
aVdecided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,
p69
aVparticularly among Igbo women,
p70
aVthe Billings ovulation method,
p71
aVwhich was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.
p72
aVBut her Igbo wasn't too good.
p73
aVSo she took me along to translate.
p74
aVI was seven.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVSo, here are these women,
p77
aVwho never discuss their period with their husbands,
p78
aVand here I am telling them, "Well, how often do you get your period?"
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aVAnd, "Do you notice any discharges?"
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aVAnd, "How swollen is your vulva?"
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVShe never would have thought of herself as a feminist,
p85
aVmy mother, but she always used to say,
p86
aV"Anything a man can do, I can fix."
p87
aV(Applause)
p88
aVAnd when my father complained about this situation,
p89
aVwhere she's taking a seven-year-old boy
p90
aVto teach this birth control, you know,
p91
aVhe used to say, "Oh, you're turning him into \u2014
p92
aVyou're teaching him how to be a woman."
p93
aVMy mother said, "Someone has to."
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VThis woman \u2014 during the Biafran war,
p97
aVwe were caught in the war.
p98
aVIt was my mother with five little children.
p99
aVIt takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,
p100
aVto make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.
p101
aVAt every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers
p102
aVwho want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,
p103
aVand make him a boy soldier.
p104
aVCan you imagine this five-foot-two woman,
p105
aVstanding up to men with guns who want to kill us?
p106
aVAll through that one year,
p107
aVmy mother never cried one time, not once.
p108
aVBut when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,
p109
aVabout to fly to England,
p110
aVthis woman saw my mother wearing this dress,
p111
aVwhich had been washed so many times it was basically see through,
p112
aVwith five really hungry-looking kids,
p113
aVcame over and asked her what had happened.
p114
aVAnd she told this woman.
p115
aVAnd so this woman emptied out her suitcase
p116
aVand gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,
p117
aVand the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but \u2014
p118
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p119
aVthat was the only time she cried.
p120
aVAnd I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,
p121
aVand I asked her, "Why did you cry then?"
p122
aVAnd she said, "You know, you can steel your heart
p123
aVagainst any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.
p124
aVBut the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger
p125
aVwill unstitch you."
p126
aa(lp127
VThe old women in my father's village, after this war had happened,
p128
aVmemorized the names of every dead person,
p129
aVand they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.
p130
aVDirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.
p131
aVAnd they would sing them only when they planted the rice,
p132
aVas though they were seeding the hearts of the dead
p133
aVinto the rice.
p134
aVBut when it came for harvest time,
p135
aVthey would sing these joyful songs,
p136
aVthat were made up of the names of every child
p137
aVwho had been born that year.
p138
aVAnd then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,
p139
aVthey would remove as many names of the dead
p140
aVthat equaled as many people that were born.
p141
aVAnd in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,
p142
aVbeautiful transformation.
p143
aa(lp144
VDid you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda,
p145
aVthe word for rape and the word for marriage
p146
aVwas the same one?
p147
aVBut today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.
p148
aVDid you also know that after apartheid,
p149
aVwhen the new government went into the parliament houses,
p150
aVthere were no female toilets in the building?
p151
aVWhich would seem to suggest that apartheid
p152
aVwas entirely the business of men.
p153
aVAll of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,
p154
aVwomen are never really counted.
p155
aVTheir humanity never seems to matter very much to us.
p156
aa(lp157
VWhen I was growing up in Nigeria \u2014
p158
aVand I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,
p159
aVbut in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from \u2014
p160
aVthere were always rites of passage for young men.
p161
aVMen were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,
p162
aVthat's essentially what it is.
p163
aVAnd a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,
p164
aVprogressing along, so when I turned 13 \u2014
p165
aVand, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,
p166
aVsomebody had to kill the animals,
p167
aVthere was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at \u2014
p168
aVso when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.
p169
aVAnd I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,
p170
aVbut I had to do it.
p171
aVAnd I was supposed to do this alone.
p172
aVBut a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,
p173
aVwho was significantly older than me,
p174
aVwho'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,
p175
aVdecided to come with me.
p176
aVWhich sort of made me feel good,
p177
aVbecause he'd seen a lot of things.
p178
aVNow, when I was growing up, he used to tell me
p179
aVstories about how he used to bayonet people,
p180
aVand their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.
p181
aVSo, this guy comes with me.
p182
aVAnd I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one \u2014
p183
aVthey sound like human beings,
p184
aVthat's why we call tragedies "a song of a goat."
p185
aVMy friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human
p186
aVuntil we started keeping goats.
p187
aVAnyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.
p188
aVSo when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,
p189
aVEmmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,
p190
aVcovers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,
p191
aVwhile I kill the goat.
p192
aVIt didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,
p193
aVand to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed
p194
aVsuch a quotidian experience,
p195
aVstill found it in himself to try to protect me.
p196
aVI was a wimp.
p197
aVI cried for a very long time.
p198
aVAnd afterwards, he didn't say a word.
p199
aVHe just sat there watching me cry for an hour.
p200
aVAnd then afterwards he said to me,
p201
aV"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,
p202
aVyou will die of heartbreak.
p203
aVJust know that it is enough sometimes
p204
aVto know that it is difficult."
p205
aVOf course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,
p206
aVand not in good ways.
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VSo, I was born two days after Christmas.
p210
aVSo growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,
p211
aVbut I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.
p212
aVSo, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,
p213
aVand we had the Catholic priest over,
p214
aVmy mother was entertaining him with tea.
p215
aVAnd my uncle suddenly says, "Where are Chris' presents?"
p216
aVAnd my mother said, "Don't talk about that in front of guests."
p217
aVBut he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,
p218
aVso he summoned me up, and he said,
p219
aV"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.
p220
aVTake anything you want out of the suitcase.
p221
aVIt's your birthday present."
p222
aVI'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,
p223
aVbut I found an inflatable sheep.
p224
aV(Laughter)
p225
aVSo, I blew it up and ran into the living room,
p226
aVmy finger where it shouldn't have been,
p227
aVI was waving this buzzing sheep around,
p228
aVand my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVAnd Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,
p231
aVjust stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,
p232
aV"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish."
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aV(Applause)
p235
aa(lp236
VMy last days in prison, the last 18 months,
p237
aVmy cellmate \u2014 for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months \u2014
p238
aVmy cellmate was 14 years old.
p239
aVThe name was John James,
p240
aVand in those days, if a family member committed a crime,
p241
aVthe military would hold you as ransom
p242
aVtill your family turned themselves in.
p243
aVSo, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.
p244
aVAnd not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.
p245
aVThere were some really bad people there.
p246
aVAnd he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books \u2014
p247
aV"Spiderman" and "X-Men."
p248
aVHe was obsessed.
p249
aVAnd when he got tired of reading them,
p250
aVhe started to teach the men in death row how to read,
p251
aVwith these comic books.
p252
aVAnd so, I remember night after night,
p253
aVyou'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,
p254
aVhuddled around John James, reciting, "Take that, Spidey!"
p255
aV(Laughter)
p256
aVIt's incredible.
p257
aVI was really worried.
p258
aVHe didn't know what death row meant.
p259
aVI'd been there twice,
p260
aVand I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.
p261
aVAnd he would always laugh, and say,
p262
aV"Come on, man, we'll make it out."
p263
aVThen I'd say, "How do you know?"
p264
aVAnd he said, "Oh, I heard it on the grapevine."
p265
aVThey killed him.
p266
aVThey handcuffed him to a chair,
p267
aVand they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,
p268
aVthen left him there to bleed to death.
p269
aVThat's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.
p270
aVAll around us, everywhere, there are people like this.
p271
aa(lp272
VThe Igbo used to say that they built their own gods.
p273
aVThey would come together as a community,
p274
aVand they would express a wish.
p275
aVAnd their wish would then be brought to a priest,
p276
aVwho would find a ritual object,
p277
aVand the appropriate sacrifices would be made,
p278
aVand the shrine would be built for the god.
p279
aVBut if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,
p280
aVthe Igbos would destroy the god.
p281
aVThey would knock down the shrine,
p282
aVand they would stop saying the god's name.
p283
aVThis is how they came to reclaim their humanity.
p284
aVEvery day, all of us here,
p285
aVwe're building gods that have gone rampant,
p286
aVand it's time we started knocking them down
p287
aVand forgetting their names.
p288
aVIt doesn't require a tremendous thing.
p289
aVAll it requires is to recognize among us, every day \u2014
p290
aVthe few of us that can see \u2014 are surrounded by people
p291
aVlike the ones I've told you.
p292
aa(lp293
VThere are some of you in this room, amazing people,
p294
aVwho offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.
p295
aVI want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.
p296
aVThe poem is called "Libation," and it's for my friend Vusi
p297
aVwho is in the audience here somewhere.
p298
aV"Libation,
p299
aVNorth Carolina, 1999.
p300
aVI offer to this ground, this gin.
p301
aVI imagine an old man crying here,
p302
aVout of the sight of the overseer.
p303
aVHe pushes his tongue through a hole
p304
aVwhere his tooth would be, if he were whole.
p305
aVIt aches in that space where his tooth would be,
p306
aVwhere his land would be,
p307
aVhis house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.
p308
aVHe wipes sorrow from his face,
p309
aVand puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,
p310
aVand tastes the salt.
p311
aVI call a name that could be his.
p312
aVThis is for you, old man.
p313
aVThis gin, this salty earth."
p314
aVThank you.

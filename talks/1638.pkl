VSo a friend of mine who's a political scientist,
p5
aVhe told me several months ago
p6
aVexactly what this month would be like.
p7
aVHe said, you know, there's this fiscal cliff coming,
p8
aVit's going to come at the beginning of 2013.
p9
aVBoth parties absolutely need to resolve it,
p10
aVbut neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it.
p11
aVNeither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due,
p12
aVso he said, December, you're just going to see lots of
p13
aVangry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart,
p14
aVreports of phone calls that aren't going well,
p15
aVpeople saying nothing's happening at all,
p16
aVand then sometime around Christmas or New Year's,
p17
aVwe're going to hear, "Okay, they resolved everything."
p18
aVHe told me that a few months ago. He said he's 98 percent positive they're going to resolve it,
p19
aVand I got an email from him today saying, all right,
p20
aVwe're basically on track, but now I'm 80 percent positive
p21
aVthat they're going to resolve it.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd it made me think. I love studying
p24
aVthese moments in American history
p25
aVwhen there was this frenzy of partisan anger,
p26
aVthat the economy was on the verge of total collapse.
p27
aa(lp28
VThe most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton
p29
aVand Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be
p30
aVand how it would be backed up, with Alexander Hamilton
p31
aVsaying, "We need a central bank, the First Bank of the United States,
p32
aVor else the dollar will have no value.
p33
aVThis economy won't work,"
p34
aVand Thomas Jefferson saying, "The people won't trust that.
p35
aVThey just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority."
p36
aVThis battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy,
p37
aVand at every moment, different partisans saying,
p38
aV"Oh my God, the economy's about to collapse,"
p39
aVand the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks
p40
aVon whatever it is we wanted to buy.
p41
aa(lp42
VTo give you a quick primer on where we are,
p43
aVa quick refresher on where we are.
p44
aVSo the fiscal cliff, I was told
p45
aVthat that's too partisan a thing to say,
p46
aValthough I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking.
p47
aVPeople say we should call it the fiscal slope,
p48
aVor we should call it an austerity crisis,
p49
aVbut then other people say, no, that's even more partisan.
p50
aVSo I just call it the self-imposed, self-destructive
p51
aVarbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem.
p52
aVAnd this is what the inevitable problem looks like.
p53
aVSo this is a projection of U.S. debt as a percentage
p54
aVof our overall economy, of GDP.
p55
aVThe light blue dotted line represents
p56
aVthe Congressional Budget Office's best guess
p57
aVof what will happen if Congress really doesn't do anything,
p58
aVand as you can see, sometime around 2027,
p59
aVwe reach Greek levels of debt,
p60
aVsomewhere around 130 percent of GDP,
p61
aVwhich tells you that some time in the next 20 years,
p62
aVif Congress does absolutely nothing,
p63
aVwe're going to hit a moment where the world's investors,
p64
aVthe world's bond buyers, are going to say,
p65
aV"We don't trust America anymore. We're not going to lend them any money,
p66
aVexcept at really high interest rates."
p67
aVAnd at that moment our economy collapses.
p68
aVBut remember, Greece is there today.
p69
aVWe're there in 20 years. We have lots and lots of time
p70
aVto avoid that crisis,
p71
aVand the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt
p72
aVat trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis.
p73
aa(lp74
VHere's another way to look at exactly the same problem.
p75
aVThe dark blue line is how much the government spends.
p76
aVThe light blue line is how much the government gets in.
p77
aVAnd as you can see, for most of recent history,
p78
aVexcept for a brief period, we have consistently spent
p79
aVmore than we take in. Thus the national debt.
p80
aVBut as you can also see, projected going forward,
p81
aVthe gap widens a bit and raises a bit,
p82
aVand this graph is only through 2021.
p83
aVIt gets really, really ugly out towards 2030.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd this graph sort of sums up what the problem is.
p86
aVThe Democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal.
p87
aVWe can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap,
p88
aVespecially if we raise taxes on the rich.
p89
aVThe Republicans say, hey, no, no, we've got a better idea.
p90
aVWhy don't we lower both lines?
p91
aVWhy don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes,
p92
aVand then we'll be on an even more favorable
p93
aVlong-term deficit trajectory?
p94
aVAnd behind this powerful disagreement between
p95
aVhow to close that gap,
p96
aVthere's the worst kind of cynical party politics,
p97
aVthe worst kind of insider baseball, lobbying, all of that stuff,
p98
aVbut there's also this powerfully interesting,
p99
aVrespectful disagreement between
p100
aVtwo fundamentally different economic philosophies.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I like to think, when I picture how Republicans
p103
aVsee the economy, what I picture is just some amazingly
p104
aVwell-engineered machine, some perfect machine.
p105
aVUnfortunately, I picture it made in Germany or Japan,
p106
aVbut this amazing machine that's constantly scouring
p107
aVevery bit of human endeavor and taking resources,
p108
aVmoney, labor, capital, machinery,
p109
aVaway from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts,
p110
aVand while this might cause temporary dislocation,
p111
aVwhat it does is it builds up the more productive areas
p112
aVand lets the less productive areas fade away and die,
p113
aVand as a result the whole system is so much more efficient,
p114
aVso much richer for everybody.
p115
aVAnd this view generally believes that there is a role for government,
p116
aVa small role, to set the rules so people aren't lying
p117
aVand cheating and hurting each other,
p118
aVmaybe, you know, have a police force and a fire department
p119
aVand an army, but to have a very limited reach
p120
aVinto the mechanisms of this machinery.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd when I picture how Democrats and Democratic-leaning
p123
aVeconomists picture this economy,
p124
aVmost Democratic economists are, you know, they're capitalists,
p125
aVthey believe, yes, that's a good system a lot of the time.
p126
aVIt's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use.
p127
aVBut that system has tons of problems.
p128
aVWealth piles up in the wrong places.
p129
aVWealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive.
p130
aVThat's not going to create an equitable, fair society.
p131
aVThat machine doesn't care about the environment,
p132
aVabout racism, about all these issues
p133
aVthat make this life worse for all of us,
p134
aVand so the government does have a role to take resources
p135
aVfrom more productive uses, or from richer sources,
p136
aVand give them to other sources.
p137
aVAnd when you think about the economy through these two different lenses,
p138
aVyou understand why this crisis is so hard to solve,
p139
aVbecause the worse the crisis gets, the higher the stakes are,
p140
aVthe more each side thinks they know the answer
p141
aVand the other side is just going to ruin everything.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot
p144
aVof the last few years really depressed about this,
p145
aVuntil this year, I learned something that
p146
aVI felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news,
p147
aVand it's so shocking, I don't like saying it, because I think
p148
aVpeople won't believe me.
p149
aVBut here's what I learned.
p150
aVThe American people, taken as a whole,
p151
aVwhen it comes to these issues, to fiscal issues,
p152
aVare moderate, pragmatic centrists.
p153
aVAnd I know that's hard to believe, that the American people
p154
aVare moderate, pragmatic centrists.
p155
aVBut let me explain what I'm thinking.
p156
aa(lp157
VWhen you look at how the federal government spends money,
p158
aVso this is the battle right here,
p159
aV55 percent, more than half, is on Social Security,
p160
aVMedicare, Medicaid, a few other health programs,
p161
aV20 percent defense, 19 percent discretionary,
p162
aVand six percent interest.
p163
aVSo when we're talking about cutting government spending,
p164
aVthis is the pie we're talking about,
p165
aVand Americans overwhelmingly, and it doesn't matter
p166
aVwhat party they're in, overwhelmingly like
p167
aVthat big 55 percent chunk.
p168
aVThey like Social Security. They like Medicare.
p169
aVThey even like Medicaid, even though that goes to the poor and indigent,
p170
aVwhich you might think would have less support.
p171
aVAnd they do not want it fundamentally touched,
p172
aValthough the American people are remarkably comfortable,
p173
aVand Democrats roughly equal to Republicans,
p174
aVwith some minor tweaks to make the system more stable.
p175
aa(lp176
VSocial Security is fairly easy to fix.
p177
aVThe rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated.
p178
aVSo gradually raise Social Security retirement age,
p179
aVmaybe only on people not yet born.
p180
aVAmericans are about 50/50,
p181
aVwhether they're Democrats or Republicans.
p182
aa(lp183
VReduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors,
p184
aVseniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it.
p185
aVPeople generally are comfortable with it, Democrats and Republicans.
p186
aa(lp187
VRaise medical health care contributions?
p188
aVEveryone hates that equally, but Republicans
p189
aVand Democrats hate that together.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd so what this tells me is, when you look at
p192
aVthe discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems,
p193
aVwe are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major, major issue.
p194
aVWe're comfortable with it needing some tweaks, but we want to keep it.
p195
aVWe're not open to a discussion of eliminating it.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow there is one issue that is hyper-partisan,
p198
aVand where there is one party that is just spend, spend, spend,
p199
aVwe don't care, spend some more,
p200
aVand that of course is Republicans
p201
aVwhen it comes to military defense spending.
p202
aVThey way outweigh Democrats.
p203
aVThe vast majority want to protect military defense spending.
p204
aVThat's 20 percent of the budget,
p205
aVand that presents a more difficult issue.
p206
aVI should also note that the [discretionary] spending,
p207
aVwhich is about 19 percent of the budget,
p208
aVthat is Democratic and Republican issues,
p209
aVso you do have welfare, food stamps, other programs
p210
aVthat tend to be popular among Democrats,
p211
aVbut you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior
p212
aVinducements for oil drilling and other things,
p213
aVwhich tend to be popular among Republicans.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow when it comes to taxes, there is more disagreement.
p216
aVThat's a more partisan area.
p217
aVYou have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive
p218
aVof raising the income tax on people who make 250,000 dollars a year,
p219
aVRepublicans sort of against it, although if you break it out by income,
p220
aVRepublicans who make less than 75,000 dollars a year like this idea.
p221
aVSo basically Republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don't want to be taxed.
p222
aVRaising taxes on investment income, you also see
p223
aVabout two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Republicans
p224
aVare comfortable with that idea.
p225
aa(lp226
VThis brings up a really important point, which is that
p227
aVwe tend in this country to talk about Democrats
p228
aVand Republicans and think there's this little group
p229
aVover there called independents that's, what, two percent?
p230
aVIf you add Democrats, you add Republicans,
p231
aVyou've got the American people.
p232
aVBut that is not the case at all.
p233
aVAnd it has not been the case for most of modern American history.
p234
aVRoughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats.
p235
aVAround a quarter say that they are Republicans.
p236
aVA tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians, or socialists,
p237
aVor some other small third party,
p238
aVand the largest block, 40 percent, say they're independents.
p239
aVSo most Americans are not partisan,
p240
aVand most of the people in the independent camp
p241
aVfall somewhere in between, so even though we have
p242
aVtremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues
p243
aVof Democrats and Republicans,
p244
aVwe have even more overlap when you add in the independents.
p245
aVNow we get to fight about all sorts of other issues.
p246
aVWe get to hate each other on gun control
p247
aVand abortion and the environment,
p248
aVbut on these fiscal issues, these important fiscal issues,
p249
aVwe just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd in fact, there's this other group of people
p252
aVwho are not as divided as people might think,
p253
aVand that group is economists.
p254
aVI talk to a lot of economists, and back in the '70s
p255
aVand '80s it was ugly being an economist.
p256
aVYou were in what they called the saltwater camp,
p257
aVmeaning Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley,
p258
aVor you were in the freshwater camp, University of Chicago,
p259
aVUniversity of Rochester.
p260
aVYou were a free market capitalist economist
p261
aVor you were a Keynesian liberal economist,
p262
aVand these people didn't go to each other's weddings,
p263
aVthey snubbed each other at conferences.
p264
aVIt's still ugly to this day, but in my experience,
p265
aVit is really, really hard to find an economist under 40
p266
aVwho still has that kind of way of seeing the world.
p267
aVThe vast majority of economists \u2014 it is so uncool
p268
aVto call yourself an ideologue of either camp.
p269
aVThe phrase that you want, if you're a graduate student
p270
aVor a postdoc or you're a professor,
p271
aVa 38-year-old economics professor, is, "I'm an empiricist.
p272
aVI go by the data."
p273
aVAnd the data is very clear.
p274
aVNone of these major theories have been completely successful.
p275
aVThe 20th century, the last hundred years,
p276
aVis riddled with disastrous examples
p277
aVof times that one school or the other tried to explain
p278
aVthe past or predict the future
p279
aVand just did an awful, awful job,
p280
aVso the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty.
p281
aVThey still are an awfully arrogant group of people, I will assure you,
p282
aVbut they're now arrogant about their impartiality,
p283
aVand they, too, see a tremendous range of potential outcomes.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd this nonpartisanship is something that exists,
p286
aVthat has existed in secret
p287
aVin America for years and years and years.
p288
aVI've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major
p289
aVorganizations that survey American political attitudes:
p290
aVPew Research,
p291
aVthe University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center,
p292
aVand the most important but the least known
p293
aVis the American National Election Studies group
p294
aVthat is the world's longest, most respected poll of political attitudes.
p295
aVThey've been doing it since 1948,
p296
aVand what they show consistently throughout
p297
aVis that it's almost impossible to find Americans
p298
aVwho are consistent ideologically,
p299
aVwho consistently support, "No we mustn't tax,
p300
aVand we must limit the size of government,"
p301
aVor, "No, we must encourage government to play a larger role
p302
aVin redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism."
p303
aVThose groups are very, very small.
p304
aVThe vast majority of people, they pick and choose,
p305
aVthey see compromise and they change over time
p306
aVwhen they hear a better argument or a worse argument.
p307
aVAnd that part of it has not changed.
p308
aVWhat has changed is how people respond to vague questions.
p309
aVIf you ask people vague questions, like,
p310
aV"Do you think there should be more government or less government?"
p311
aV"Do you think government should" \u2014 especially if you use loaded language \u2014
p312
aV"Do you think the government should provide handouts?"
p313
aVOr, "Do you think the government should redistribute?"
p314
aVThen you can see radical partisan change.
p315
aVBut when you get specific, when you actually ask
p316
aVabout the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration,
p317
aVpeople are remarkably centrist,
p318
aVthey're remarkably open to compromise.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo what we have, then, when you think about the fiscal cliff,
p321
aVdon't think of it as the American people fundamentally
p322
aVcan't stand each other on these issues
p323
aVand that we must be ripped apart
p324
aVinto two separate warring nations.
p325
aVThink of it as a tiny, tiny number of ancient economists
p326
aVand misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process.
p327
aVAnd they've captured the process through familiar ways,
p328
aVthrough a primary system which encourages
p329
aVthat small group of people's voices,
p330
aVbecause that small group of people,
p331
aVthe people who answer all yeses or all noes
p332
aVon those ideological questions,
p333
aVthey might be small but every one of them has a blog,
p334
aVevery one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week.
p335
aVEvery one of them becomes a louder and louder voice,
p336
aVbut they don't represent us.
p337
aVThey don't represent what our views are.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd that gets me back to the dollar,
p340
aVand it gets me back to reminding myself that
p341
aVwe know this experience.
p342
aVWe know what it's like
p343
aVto have these people on TV, in Congress,
p344
aVyelling about how the end of the world is coming
p345
aVif we don't adopt their view completely,
p346
aVbecause it's happened about the dollar
p347
aVever since there's been a dollar.
p348
aVWe had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton.
p349
aVIn 1913, we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve,
p350
aVwhen it was created, with vicious, angry arguments
p351
aVover how it would be constituted,
p352
aVand a general agreement that the way it was constituted
p353
aVwas the worst possible compromise,
p354
aVa compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing,
p355
aVthis dollar, but then everyone agreeing, okay,
p356
aVso long as we're on the gold standard, it should be okay.
p357
aVThe Fed can't mess it up so badly.
p358
aVBut then we got off the gold standard for individuals
p359
aVduring the Depression and we got off the gold standard
p360
aVas a source of international currency coordination
p361
aVduring Richard Nixon's presidency.
p362
aVEach of those times, we were on the verge of complete collapse.
p363
aVAnd nothing happened at all.
p364
aVThroughout it all, the dollar has been
p365
aVone of the most long-standing,
p366
aVstable, reasonable currencies,
p367
aVand we all use it every single day,
p368
aVno matter what the people screaming about tell us,
p369
aVno matter how scared we're supposed to be.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd this long-term fiscal picture that we're in right now,
p372
aVI think what is most maddening about it is,
p373
aVif Congress were simply able
p374
aVto show not that they agree with each other,
p375
aVnot that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise,
p376
aVbut that they are able to just begin the process
p377
aVtowards compromise, we all instantly are better off.
p378
aVThe fear is that the world is watching.
p379
aVThe fear is that the longer we delay any solution,
p380
aVthe more the world will look to the U.S.
p381
aVnot as the bedrock of stability in the global economy,
p382
aVbut as a place that can't resolve its own fights,
p383
aVand the longer we put that off, the more we make the world nervous,
p384
aVthe higher interest rates are going to be,
p385
aVthe quicker we're going to have to face a day
p386
aVof horrible calamity.
p387
aVAnd so just the act of compromise itself,
p388
aVand sustained, real compromise,
p389
aVwould give us even more time,
p390
aVwould allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain
p391
aVand reach even more compromise down the road.
p392
aa(lp393
VSo I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen
p394
aVis to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise,
p395
aVto not talk about this in those vague and scary terms
p396
aVthat do polarize us,
p397
aVbut to just talk about it like what it is,
p398
aVnot an existential crisis,
p399
aVnot some battle between two fundamentally different religious views,
p400
aVbut a math problem, a really solvable math problem,
p401
aVone where we're not all going to get what we want
p402
aVand one where, you know, there's going to be a little pain to spread around.
p403
aVBut the more we address it as a practical concern,
p404
aVthe sooner we can resolve it,
p405
aVand the more time we have to resolve it, paradoxically.
p406
aVThank you. (Applause)

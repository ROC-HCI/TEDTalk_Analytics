VDogs have interests.
p5
aVThey have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels.
p6
aVAnd if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.
p7
aVIt's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought
p8
aVthat if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it,
p9
aVand the owner says, you know, "Puppy, come here, come here,"
p10
aVand the dog thinks, "Hmm, interesting.
p11
aVI'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling."
p12
aVIt's a difficult choice, right?
p13
aVRear end, owner. Rear end wins.
p14
aVI mean, you lose.
p15
aVYou cannot compete with the environment,
p16
aVif you have an adolescent dog's brain.
p17
aVSo, when we train, we're always trying to take into account
p18
aVthe dog's point of view.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, I'm here largely because
p21
aVthere's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment
p22
aVthat \u2014 on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,
p23
aVnumber one, by making up rules, human rules.
p24
aVWe don't take the dog's point of view into account.
p25
aVSo the human says, "You're going to act this way, damn it.
p26
aVWe're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will."
p27
aVThen, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.
p28
aVAnd then number three, now we can punish the dog
p29
aVfor breaking rules he didn't even know existed.
p30
aVSo you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.
p31
aVWhen he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg \u2014
p32
aVyou know, isn't that nice?
p33
aVAnd you go, "Oh, there's a good boy."
p34
aVYou bend down, you pat him \u2014 you reward him for jumping up.
p35
aVHis one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later,
p36
aVhe weighs, you know, 80 pounds.
p37
aVEvery time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.
p38
aVI mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo, this whole dominance issue \u2014 number one,
p41
aVwhat we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation
p42
aVof a very complicated social system.
p43
aVAnd they take this stuff seriously.
p44
aVMale dogs are very serious about a hierarchy,
p45
aVbecause it prevents physical fights.
p46
aVOf course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand,
p47
aVhave several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.
p48
aVThe number one is, "I have it, you don't."
p49
aVAnd what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch
p50
aVwill quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.
p51
aVSo, we get in dog training this notion of dominances,
p52
aVor of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.
p53
aa(lp54
VDogs get so abused.
p55
aVDogs, horses and humans \u2014
p56
aVthese are the three species which are so abused in life.
p57
aVAnd the reason is built into their behavior \u2014
p58
aVis to always come back and apologize.
p59
aVLike, "Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault."
p60
aVThey are just so beatable,
p61
aVand that's why they get beaten.
p62
aVThe poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?
p63
aV"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws,
p64
aVstamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice,
p65
aVhit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,
p66
aVknee him in the chest, flip him over backwards."
p67
aVBecause he grew?
p68
aVAnd because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?
p69
aVThis is insanity.
p70
aVI ask owners, "Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?"
p71
aVAnd people say, "Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess."
p72
aVI said, "Let's teach him to sit."
p73
aVAnd then we give him a reason for sitting.
p74
aVBecause the first stage
p75
aVis basically teaching a dog ESL.
p76
aVI could speak to you and say, "Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey."
p77
aVGo on, something should happen now.
p78
aVWhy aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili.
p79
aVWell, I've got news for you.
p80
aVThe dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL,
p83
aVEnglish as a second language.
p84
aVAnd that's how we use the food lure in the hand,
p85
aVand we use food because we're dealing with owners.
p86
aVMy wife doesn't need food \u2014 she's a great trainer,
p87
aVmuch better than I am.
p88
aVI don't need food, but the average owner says,
p89
aV"Puppy, sit."
p90
aVOr they go, "Sit, sit, sit."
p91
aVThey're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,
p92
aVlike the dog has a third eye there \u2014 it's insane.
p93
aVYou know, "Sit, sit."
p94
aVNo, we go, "Puppy, sit" \u2014 boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.
p95
aa(lp96
VThen we phase out the food as a lure,
p97
aVand now the dog knows that "sit" means sit,
p98
aVand you can actually communicate to a dog
p99
aVin a perfectly constructed English sentence.
p100
aV"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please."
p101
aVAnd I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to"
p102
aVand the name of my son, "Jamie."
p103
aVAnd the dog can take a note,
p104
aVand I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.
p105
aVHe'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,
p106
aVwherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,
p107
aVand take him a little message that says,
p108
aV"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."
p109
aa(lp110
VSo, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.
p111
aVWill it do it?
p112
aVNot necessarily, no.
p113
aVAs I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff,
p114
aVwhy come to the owner?
p115
aVThe dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.
p116
aVThe dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.
p117
aVAt the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing
p118
aVwith smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do
p121
aVwhat we want him to do, and this is very easy.
p122
aVWe use the Premack principle.
p123
aVBasically, we follow a low-frequency behavior \u2014
p124
aVone the dog doesn't want to do \u2014
p125
aVby a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem,
p126
aVor a dog hobby \u2014 something the dog does like to do.
p127
aVThat will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.
p128
aVSo we go, "sit," on the couch; "sit," tummy-rub; "sit,"
p129
aVlook, I throw a tennis ball; "sit," say hello to that other dog.
p130
aVYes, we put "sniff butt" on queue.
p131
aV"Sit," sniff butt.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo now all of these distractions that worked against training
p134
aVnow become rewards that work for training.
p135
aVAnd what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like \u2014
p136
aVwe're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.
p137
aVAnd I can imagine this dog, you know,
p138
aVspeaking through the fence to, say, an Akita,
p139
aVsaying, "Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.
p140
aVThey're like Golden Retrievers.
p141
aVAll I have to do is sit, and they do everything.
p142
aVThey open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,
p143
aVthey will throw tennis balls,
p144
aVthey will cook for me and serve the food.
p145
aVIt's like, if I just sit, that's my command.
p146
aVThen I have my own personal doorman,
p147
aVchauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter."
p148
aVAnd now the dog's really happy.
p149
aVAnd this, to me, is always what training is.
p150
aVSo we really motivate the dog to want to do it,
p151
aVsuch that the need for punishment seldom comes up.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow we move to phase three, when now \u2014
p154
aVthere's times, you know, when daddy knows best.
p155
aVAnd I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says,
p156
aV"Because I'm the daddy, that's why."
p157
aVSorry, no more explanation. "I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit."
p158
aVAnd there's times, for example,
p159
aVif my son's friends leave the door open,
p160
aVthe dogs have to know you don't step across this line.
p161
aVThis is a life-or-death thing.
p162
aVYou leave this, the sanctity of your house,
p163
aVand you could be hit on the street.
p164
aVSo some things we have to let the dog know,
p165
aV"You mustn't do this."
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd so we have to enforce, but without force.
p168
aVPeople here get very confused about what a punishment is.
p169
aVThey think a punishment is something nasty.
p170
aVI bet a lot of you do, right?
p171
aVYou think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.
p172
aVIt doesn't have to be.
p173
aVThere's several definitions of what a punishment is,
p174
aVbut one definition, the most popular, is:
p175
aVa punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior,
p176
aVsuch that it's less likely to occur in the future.
p177
aVIt does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.
p178
aVAnd I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.
p179
aa(lp180
VI was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.
p181
aVAnd this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital,
p182
aVplus the brother-in-law, plus the child.
p183
aVAnd I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house,
p184
aVand they never took it outside.
p185
aVThe dog is actually euthanized now,
p186
aVbut this was a dog I worked with for a while.
p187
aVA lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen,
p188
aVso while I was there \u2014 this was on the fourth visit \u2014
p189
aVwe did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.
p190
aVAnd he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.
p191
aVWhen the dog would try to leave the mat,
p192
aVshe would say, "Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat."
p193
aVThe dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner,
p194
aVbecause we had a lot of aggression related towards food.
p195
aVThe breaks got fewer and fewer.
p196
aVYou see, the punishment was working.
p197
aVThe behavior problem was going away.
p198
aVShe never raised her voice.
p199
aVIf she did, she would have got bitten.
p200
aVIt's not a good dog you shout at.
p201
aVAnd a lot of my friends train really neat animals,
p202
aVgrizzly bears \u2014 if you've ever seen a grizzly bear
p203
aVon the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it \u2014
p204
aVkiller whales. I love it because it wires you up.
p205
aVHow are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?
p206
aV"Bad bear, bad bear!" Voom!
p207
aVYour head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?
p208
aVThis is crazy.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo, where do we go from here?
p211
aVWe want a better way.
p212
aVDogs deserve better.
p213
aVBut for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.
p214
aVIt has to do with watching people train puppies,
p215
aVand realizing they have horrendous interaction skills,
p216
aVhorrendous relationship skills.
p217
aVNot just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.
p218
aVI mean, my all-time classic is another "come here" one.
p219
aVYou see someone in the park \u2014 and I'll cover my mic when I say this,
p220
aVbecause I don't want to wake you up \u2014 and there's the owner in the park,
p221
aVand their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here.
p222
aVRover, come here. Rover, come here, you son of a bitch."
p223
aVThe dog says, "I don't think so."
p224
aV(Laughter)
p225
aVI mean, who in their right mind
p226
aVwould think that a dog would want to approach them
p227
aVwhen they're screaming like that?
p228
aVInstead, the dog says, "I know that tone. I know that tone.
p229
aVPreviously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there."
p230
aVI was walking onto a plane \u2014
p231
aVthis, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career,
p232
aVand it really cemented what I wanted to do
p233
aVwith this whole puppy-training thing,
p234
aVthe notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way
p235
aVto want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them.
p236
aVYou know, I puppy-train my child.
p237
aVAnd the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas,
p238
aVand in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five,
p239
aVkicking the back of the chair.
p240
aV"Johnny, don't do that."
p241
aVKick, kick, kick.
p242
aV"Johnny, don't do that." Kick, kick, kick.
p243
aVI'm standing right here with my bag.
p244
aVThe father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face.
p245
aVAnd ugly face is this \u2014
p246
aVwhen you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child,
p247
aVyou say, "What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!"
p248
aVAnd I went, "Oh my God, do I do something?"
p249
aVThat child has lost everything \u2014
p250
aVthat one of the two people he can trust in this world
p251
aVhas absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet.
p252
aVAnd I thought, "Do I tell this jerk to quit it?"
p253
aVI thought, "Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on."
p254
aVI walked to the back of the plane,
p255
aVI sat down, and a thought came to me.
p256
aVIf that had been a dog, I would have laid him out.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVIf he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out.
p259
aVHe kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd this is what it's all about.
p262
aVThese relationship skills are so easy.
p263
aVI mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate
p264
aVbased on the three Cs \u2014 coat color, conformation, cuteness.
p265
aVYou know, kind of like a little robot.
p266
aVThis is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year.
p267
aVAnd then, a little behavior problem comes up.
p268
aVNo different from the dog barking.
p269
aVThe husband won't clear up his clothes,
p270
aVor the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?
p271
aVAnd it then starts, and we get into this thing,
p272
aVand our personal feedback \u2014 there's two things about it.
p273
aVWhen you watch people interacting with animals or other people,
p274
aVthere is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.
p275
aVAnd when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.
p276
aVYou see it's especially in families, especially with spouses,
p277
aVespecially with children, especially with parents.
p278
aVYou see it especially in the workplace,
p279
aVespecially from boss to employee.
p280
aVIt's as if there's some schadenfreude there,
p281
aVthat we actually take delight in people getting things wrong,
p282
aVso that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd this, I would say, is the biggest human foible that we have.
p285
aVIt really is.
p286
aVWe take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad.
p287
aVAnd I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught.
p288
aVYou know, calculus is wonderful.
p289
aVWhen I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz.
p290
aVI don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.
p291
aVGeometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics \u2014
p292
aVthese are cool things.
p293
aVBut they don't save marriages and they don't raise children.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd my look to the future is,
p296
aVand what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people
p297
aVthat you know, your husband's just as easy to train.
p298
aVProbably easier \u2014 if you got a Rottie \u2014 much easier to train.
p299
aVYour kids are easy to train.
p300
aVAll you've got to do is to watch them,
p301
aVto time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes,
p302
aVyou ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?"
p303
aVIf it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you."
p304
aVThat is such a powerful training technique.
p305
aVThis should be taught in schools.
p306
aVRelationships \u2014 how do you negotiate?
p307
aVHow you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy?
p308
aVYou know, how to prepare you for your first relationship?
p309
aVHow on earth about raising children?
p310
aVWe think how we do it \u2014 one night in bed, we're pregnant,
p311
aVand then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child.
p312
aVNo, this is what should be taught \u2014 the good living, the good habits,
p313
aVwhich are just as hard to break as bad habits.
p314
aVSo, that would be my wish to the future.
p315
aVAh, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time,
p316
aVbut I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two \u2014
p317
aVso thank you very much. That's my talk, thank you.

VMost people don't know that when I went to high school in this country \u2014
p5
aVI applied for university at a time when I was convinced
p6
aVI was going to be an artist and be a sculptor.
p7
aVAnd I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky.
p8
aVMy family was wealthy, and my father believed in one thing,
p9
aVand that was to give us all as much education as we wanted.
p10
aVAnd I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.
p11
aVAnd he was a clever man. He sort of said,
p12
aV"Well, that's OK, but you've done very well in your math SATs."
p13
aVIn fact, I'd got an 800. And he thought I did very well \u2014 and I did, too \u2014 in the arts:
p14
aVthis was my passion.
p15
aVAnd he said "If you go to MIT," to which I had been given early admission,
p16
aV"I will pay for every year you're at MIT,
p17
aVin graduate or undergraduate \u2014 as much as you want \u2014
p18
aVI will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris."
p19
aVAnd I thought that was the best deal in town, so I accepted it immediately.
p20
aVAnd I decided that if I was good in art, and I was good in mathematics,
p21
aVI'd study architecture, which was the blending of the two.
p22
aa(lp23
VI went and told my headmaster that, at prep school.
p24
aVAnd I said to him what I was doing, that I was going to go study architecture
p25
aVbecause it was art and mathematics put together.
p26
aVHe said to me something that just went completely over my head.
p27
aVHe said, "You know, I like grey suits, and I like pin-striped suits,
p28
aVbut I don't like grey pin-striped suits."
p29
aVAnd I thought, "What a turkey this guy is," and I went off to MIT.
p30
aVI studied architecture, then did a second degree in architecture,
p31
aVand then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture.
p32
aVThat really, the mixing of art and science was computers,
p33
aVand that that really was the place to bring both, and enjoyed a career doing that.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd probably, if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale,
p36
aVI'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation
p37
aVwhere you spend time making it possible for others to be creative.
p38
aVAnd after doing this for a long time, and the Media Lab passing the baton on,
p39
aVI thought, "Well, maybe it's time for me to do a project.
p40
aVSomething that would be important, but also something
p41
aVthat would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had."
p42
aVAnd in the case of the Media Lab, knowing a lot of people,
p43
aVknowing people who were either executives or wealthy,
p44
aVand also not having, in my own case, a career to worry about anymore.
p45
aVMy career, I mean, I'd done my career.
p46
aVDidn't have to worry about earning money.
p47
aVDidn't have to worry about what people thought about me.
p48
aVAnd I said, "Boy, let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features,"
p49
aVand thought that if we could address education, by leveraging the children,
p50
aVand bringing to the world the access of the computers,
p51
aVthat that was really the thing we should do.
p52
aVNever shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.
p53
aVIt's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.
p54
aVIt's about two weeks old. There they are, folks.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VIf you look at the picture, you'll see they're stacked up.
p59
aVThose are conveyor belts that go around.
p60
aVThis is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by,
p61
aVbut then you'll see the ones up above.
p62
aVWhat happens is, they burn into flash memory the software,
p63
aVand then test them for a few hours.
p64
aVBut you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant.
p65
aVSo they go around in this loop, which is why you see them up there.
p66
aVSo this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back.
p67
aVThis picture was taken in 1982, just before the IBM PC was even announced.
p68
aVSeymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools
p69
aVand developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself.
p70
aVBut one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it
p71
aVjust the same way as our kids do here.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd when people tell me, "Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids?"
p74
aVI say to myself, "What planet do you come from?"
p75
aVOkay, there's not a person in this room \u2014 I don't care how techie you are \u2014
p76
aVthere's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid
p77
aVto help them debug it. OK?
p78
aVWe all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned.
p79
aVThis picture of Seymour \u2014 25 years ago. Seymour made a very simple
p80
aVobservation in 1968, and then basically presented it in 1970 \u2014
p81
aVApril 11 to be precise \u2014 called "Teaching Children Thinking."
p82
aVWhat he observed was that kids who write computer programs
p83
aVunderstand things differently, and when they debug the programs,
p84
aVthey come the closest to learning about learning.
p85
aVThat was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that.
p86
aVKids don't program enough and boy,
p87
aVif there's anything I hope this brings back, it's programming to kids.
p88
aa(lp89
VIt's really important. Using applications is OK,
p90
aVbut programming is absolutely fundamental.
p91
aVThis is being launched with three languages in it: Squeak, Logo, and
p92
aVa third, that I've never even seen before.
p93
aVThe point being, this is going to be very, very intensive on the programming side.
p94
aVThis photograph is very important because it's much later.
p95
aVThis is in the early 2000s. My son, Dimitri \u2014 who's here,
p96
aVmany of you know Dimitri \u2014 went to Cambodia, set up this school
p97
aVthat we had built, just as the school connected it to the Internet.
p98
aVAnd these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this,
p99
aVplus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child.
p100
aVThis is the same village in Cambodia, just a couple of months ago.
p101
aVThese kids are real pros. There were just 7,000 machines out there
p102
aVbeing tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental.
p103
aa(lp104
VEverybody advised me not to be a nonprofit, but they were all wrong.
p105
aVAnd the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.
p106
aVThere are many reasons, but the two that merit the little bit of time is:
p107
aVone, the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear.
p108
aVI can see any head of state, any executive I want, at any time, because
p109
aVI'm not selling laptops. OK? I have no shareholders.
p110
aVWhether we sell, it doesn't make any difference whatsoever.
p111
aVThe clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive \u2014
p112
aVyou can get the best people in the world.
p113
aVIf you look at our professional services, including search firms,
p114
aVincluding communications, including legal services, including banking,
p115
aVthey're all pro bono. And it's not to save money.
p116
aVWe've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people.
p117
aVYou get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission,
p118
aVand they're the best people.
p119
aa(lp120
VWe couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary,
p121
aVand we had a queue of people.
p122
aVIt allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be
p123
aVour partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan
p124
aVwas very important, and the U.N. allowed us
p125
aVto basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing
p126
aVbefore I met Yves Behar.
p127
aVAnd while this machine in some sense is silly,
p128
aVin retrospect, it actually served a very important purpose.
p129
aVThat pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody.
p130
aVEverybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank. It's different.
p131
aVIt was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike.
p132
aVEven though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank \u2014
p133
aVit really is stupid to have it on board, by the way.
p134
aVIn spite of what some people in the press don't get it, didn't understand it,
p135
aVwe didn't take it off because we didn't want to do \u2014
p136
aVhaving it on the laptop itself is really not what you want.
p137
aVYou want a separate thing, like the AC adaptor.
p138
aVI didn't bring one with me, but they really work much better off-board.
p139
aVAnd then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things.
p140
aa(lp141
VJust keep in mind \u2014 because there are other people, including Bill Gates,
p142
aVwho said, "Gee, you've got a real computer."
p143
aVThat computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things \u2014
p144
aVthere are four of them \u2014
p145
aVthat you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power,
p146
aVand I hope that's picked up more by the industry.
p147
aVThat the reason that you want to be below two watts is
p148
aVthat's roughly what you can generate with your upper body.
p149
aVDual-mode display \u2014 that sunlight display's fantastic.
p150
aVWe were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.
p151
aVAnd that was really critical. The mesh network, it'll become commonplace.
p152
aVAnd of course, "rugged" goes without saying.
p153
aVAnd the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd by the way, when I graduated from MIT,
p156
aVI thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years. (Laughter)
p157
aVSo, I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons.
p158
aVThe most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product.
p159
aVMost people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design,
p160
aVcheap labor, cheap components, and making a cheap laptop.
p161
aVAnd, in English, the word "cheap" has
p162
aVa double meaning, which is really appropriate,
p163
aVbecause it's cheap, in the pejorative sense, as well as inexpensive.
p164
aVBut if you take a different approach, and you think of very large-scale integration,
p165
aVvery advanced materials, very advanced manufacturing \u2014
p166
aVso you're pouring chemicals in one end, iPods are spewing out the other \u2014
p167
aVand really cool design, that's what we wanted to do.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd I can race through these and save a lot of time because
p170
aVYves and I obviously didn't compare notes.
p171
aVThese are his slides, and so I don't have to talk about them.
p172
aVBut it was really, to us, very important as a strategy.
p173
aVIt wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody \u2014
p174
aVyou know, good design is very important.
p175
aVYves showed one of the power-generating devices.
p176
aVThe mesh network, the reason I \u2014 and I won't go into it in great detail \u2014
p177
aVbut when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world,
p178
aVthey're connected. There's not just laptops.
p179
aVAnd so, we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators.
p180
aVIt's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other.
p181
aVIf you're in a desert, they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart.
p182
aVIf you're in the jungle, it's about 500 meters. So if a kid bicycles home,
p183
aVor walks a few miles, they're going to be off the grid, so to speak.
p184
aVThey're not going to be near another laptop,
p185
aVso you have to nail these onto a tree, and sort of, get it.
p186
aa(lp187
VYou don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network.
p188
aVAnd that's very important, the user interface.
p189
aVWe are launching with 18 keyboards. English is by far the minority.
p190
aVLatin is relatively rare, too. You just look at some of the languages.
p191
aVI'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before.
p192
aVIs there anybody in the room, one person, unless you work with OLPC,
p193
aVis there anybody in the room that can tell me what language
p194
aVthe keyboard is that's on the screen? There's only one hand \u2014 so you get it.
p195
aVYes, you're right. He's right. It's Amharic,
p196
aVit's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia, there's never been a keyboard.
p197
aVThere is no keyboard standard because there's no market.
p198
aVAnd this is the big difference.
p199
aa(lp200
VAgain, when you're a nonprofit, you look at children as a mission, not as a market.
p201
aVSo we went to Ethiopia, and we helped them make a keyboard.
p202
aVAnd this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard.
p203
aVSo what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out.
p204
aVAnd we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning \u2014
p205
aVit was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning,
p206
aVit's not what we're doing now \u2014 is to go to six countries.
p207
aVBig countries, one of them is not so big, but it's rich.
p208
aVHere's the six. We went to the six,
p209
aVand in each case the head of state said he would do it, he'd do a million.
p210
aVIn the case of Gaddafi, he'd do 1.2 million, and that they would launch it.
p211
aVWe thought, this is exactly the right strategy, get it out,
p212
aVand then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd so I went to each of those countries
p215
aVat least six times, met with the head of state probably two or three times.
p216
aVIn each case, got the ministers, went through a lot of the stuff.
p217
aVThis was a period in my life where I was traveling 330 days per year.
p218
aVNot something you'd envy or want to do.
p219
aVIn the case of Libya, it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent.
p220
aVThe camel smells were unbelievable.
p221
aVAnd it was 45 degrees C. I mean, this was not
p222
aVwhat you'd call a cool experience. And former countries \u2014
p223
aVI say former, because none of them really came through this summer \u2014
p224
aVthere was a big difference between getting a head of state
p225
aVto have a photo opportunity, make a press release.
p226
aVSo we went to smaller ones. Uruguay, bless their hearts.
p227
aVSmall country, not so rich. President said he'd do it, and guess what?
p228
aVHe did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us,
p229
aVnothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power,
p230
aVbut just a vanilla laptop proposal.
p231
aVAnd guess what? We won it hands down.
p232
aVWhen it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay,
p233
aVthe first 100,000, boom, went to OLPC.
p234
aVThe next day \u2014 the next day, not even 24 hours had passed \u2014 in Peru,
p235
aVthe president of Peru said, "We'll do 250." And boom, a little domino effect.
p236
aa(lp237
VThe president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it.
p238
aVThe president of Ethiopia said he would do it.
p239
aVAnd boom, boom, boom. The president of Mongolia.
p240
aVAnd so what happens is, these things start to happen with these countries \u2014
p241
aVstill not enough.
p242
aVAdd up all those countries, it didn't quite get to thing, so we said,
p243
aV"Let's start a program in the United States." So, end of August, early September,
p244
aVwe decide to do this. We announced it near the middle, end \u2014
p245
aVjust when the Clinton Initiative was taking place.
p246
aVWe thought that was a good time to announce it.
p247
aVLaunched it on the 12 of November.
p248
aVWe said it would be just for a short period until the 26. We've extended it until the 31.
p249
aVAnd the "Give One, Get One" program is really important because
p250
aVit got a lot of people absolutely interested.
p251
aa(lp252
VThe first day it was just wild. And then we said,
p253
aV"Well, let's get people to give many. Not just one, and get one,
p254
aVbut maybe give 100, give 1,000." And that's where you come in.
p255
aVAnd that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and
p256
aVbuy 400 dollars worth of laptops. Okay? Do it, but that's not going to help. Okay?
p257
aVIf everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars,
p258
aVwhatever it is, 300 people in the room doing it \u2014 yeah, great.
p259
aVI want you do something else.
p260
aVAnd it's not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000, though,
p261
aVI invite you to do that, and 10,000 would be even better.
p262
aa(lp263
VTell people about it! It's got to become viral, OK?
p264
aVUse your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists.
p265
aVGet your friends to give one, get one.
p266
aVAnd if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people, that would be fantastic.
p267
aVI won't dwell on the pricing at all.
p268
aVJust to say that when you do the "Give One, Get One,"
p269
aVa lot of press is a bit about, "They didn't make it, it's 188 dollars, it's not 100."
p270
aVIt will be 100 in two years. It will go below 100.
p271
aVWe've pledged not to add features, but to bring that price down.
p272
aVBut it was the countries that wanted it to go up, and
p273
aVwe let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do \u2014
p274
aVI've just said it. Don't just give one, get one.
p275
aa(lp276
VI just want to end with one last one. This one is not even
p277
aV24-hours old, or maybe it's 24-hours.
p278
aVThe first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship,
p279
aVand I'm talking now about 7,000, 8,000 at a time went out this week.
p280
aVThey went to Uruguay, Peru, Mexico.
p281
aVAnd it's been slow coming, and we're only making about 5,000 a week,
p282
aVbut we hope, we hope, sometime in next year,
p283
aVmaybe by the middle of the year,
p284
aVto hit a million a month. Now put that number,
p285
aVand a million isn't so much. It's not a big number.
p286
aVWe're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year.
p287
aVBut a million a month in laptop-land is a big number.
p288
aVAnd the world production today, everybody combined, making laptops,
p289
aVis five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year,
p290
aVwe're going to make 20 percent of the world production.
p291
aVAnd if we do that, there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there.
p292
aVAnd we hope if you have EG two years from now,
p293
aVor whenever you have it again,
p294
aVI won't have bad breath, and I will be invited back,
p295
aVand will have, hopefully by then, maybe 100 million out there to children.
p296
aVThank you.

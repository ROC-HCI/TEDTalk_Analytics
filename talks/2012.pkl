VAt every stage of our lives
p5
aVwe make decisions that will profoundly influence
p6
aVthe lives of the people we're going to become,
p7
aVand then when we become those people,
p8
aVwe're not always thrilled with the decisions we made.
p9
aVSo young people pay good money
p10
aVto get tattoos removed that teenagers
p11
aVpaid good money to get.
p12
aVMiddle-aged people rushed to divorce people
p13
aVwho young adults rushed to marry.
p14
aVOlder adults work hard to lose
p15
aVwhat middle-aged adults worked hard to gain.
p16
aVOn and on and on.
p17
aVThe question is, as a psychologist, that fascinates me is,
p18
aVwhy do we make decisions
p19
aVthat our future selves so often regret?
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, I think one of the reasons \u2014
p22
aVI'll try to convince you today \u2014
p23
aVis that we have a fundamental misconception
p24
aVabout the power of time.
p25
aVEvery one of you knows that the rate of change
p26
aVslows over the human lifespan,
p27
aVthat your children seem to change by the minute
p28
aVbut your parents seem to change by the year.
p29
aVBut what is the name of this magical point in life
p30
aVwhere change suddenly goes
p31
aVfrom a gallop to a crawl?
p32
aVIs it teenage years? Is it middle age?
p33
aVIs it old age? The answer, it turns out,
p34
aVfor most people, is now,
p35
aVwherever now happens to be.
p36
aVWhat I want to convince you today
p37
aVis that all of us are walking around with an illusion,
p38
aVan illusion that history, our personal history,
p39
aVhas just come to an end,
p40
aVthat we have just recently become
p41
aVthe people that we were always meant to be
p42
aVand will be for the rest of our lives.
p43
aa(lp44
VLet me give you some data to back up that claim.
p45
aVSo here's a study of change in people's
p46
aVpersonal values over time.
p47
aVHere's three values.
p48
aVEverybody here holds all of them,
p49
aVbut you probably know that as you grow,
p50
aVas you age, the balance of these values shifts.
p51
aVSo how does it do so?
p52
aVWell, we asked thousands of people.
p53
aVWe asked half of them to predict for us
p54
aVhow much their values would change in the next 10 years,
p55
aVand the others to tell us
p56
aVhow much their values had changed in the last 10 years.
p57
aVAnd this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis,
p58
aVbecause it allowed us to compare the predictions
p59
aVof people, say, 18 years old,
p60
aVto the reports of people who were 28,
p61
aVand to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan.
p62
aa(lp63
VHere's what we found.
p64
aVFirst of all, you are right,
p65
aVchange does slow down as we age,
p66
aVbut second, you're wrong,
p67
aVbecause it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.
p68
aVAt every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set,
p69
aVpeople vastly underestimated how much change
p70
aVthey would experience over the next 10 years.
p71
aVWe call this the "end of history" illusion.
p72
aVTo give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect,
p73
aVyou can connect these two lines,
p74
aVand what you see here is that 18-year-olds
p75
aVanticipate changing only as much
p76
aVas 50-year-olds actually do.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things.
p79
aVFor example, personality.
p80
aVMany of you know that psychologists now claim
p81
aVthat there are five fundamental dimensions of personality:
p82
aVneuroticism, openness to experience,
p83
aVagreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.
p84
aVAgain, we asked people how much they expected
p85
aVto change over the next 10 years,
p86
aVand also how much they had changed over the last 10 years,
p87
aVand what we found,
p88
aVwell, you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over,
p89
aVbecause once again the rate of change
p90
aVdoes slow as we age,
p91
aVbut at every age, people underestimate
p92
aVhow much their personalities will change
p93
aVin the next decade.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd it isn't just ephemeral things
p96
aVlike values and personality.
p97
aVYou can ask people about their likes and dislikes,
p98
aVtheir basic preferences.
p99
aVFor example, name your best friend,
p100
aVyour favorite kind of vacation,
p101
aVwhat's your favorite hobby,
p102
aVwhat's your favorite kind of music.
p103
aVPeople can name these things.
p104
aVWe ask half of them to tell us,
p105
aV"Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years?"
p106
aVand half of them to tell us,
p107
aV"Did that change over the last 10 years?"
p108
aVAnd what we find, well, you've seen it twice now,
p109
aVand here it is again:
p110
aVpeople predict that the friend they have now
p111
aVis the friend they'll have in 10 years,
p112
aVthe vacation they most enjoy now is the one
p113
aVthey'll enjoy in 10 years,
p114
aVand yet, people who are 10 years older all say,
p115
aV"Eh, you know, that's really changed."
p116
aa(lp117
VDoes any of this matter?
p118
aVIs this just a form of mis-prediction that doesn't have consequences?
p119
aVNo, it matters quite a bit, and I'll give you an example of why.
p120
aVIt bedevils our decision-making in important ways.
p121
aVBring to mind right now for yourself
p122
aVyour favorite musician today
p123
aVand your favorite musician 10 years ago.
p124
aVI put mine up on the screen to help you along.
p125
aVNow we asked people
p126
aVto predict for us, to tell us
p127
aVhow much money they would pay right now
p128
aVto see their current favorite musician
p129
aVperform in concert 10 years from now,
p130
aVand on average, people said they would pay
p131
aV129 dollars for that ticket.
p132
aVAnd yet, when we asked them how much they would pay
p133
aVto see the person who was their favorite
p134
aV10 years ago perform today,
p135
aVthey say only 80 dollars.
p136
aVNow, in a perfectly rational world,
p137
aVthese should be the same number,
p138
aVbut we overpay for the opportunity
p139
aVto indulge our current preferences
p140
aVbecause we overestimate their stability.
p141
aa(lp142
VWhy does this happen? We're not entirely sure,
p143
aVbut it probably has to do
p144
aVwith the ease of remembering
p145
aVversus the difficulty of imagining.
p146
aVMost of us can remember who we were 10 years ago,
p147
aVbut we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be,
p148
aVand then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine,
p149
aVit's not likely to happen.
p150
aVSorry, when people say "I can't imagine that,"
p151
aVthey're usually talking about their own lack of imagination,
p152
aVand not about the unlikelihood
p153
aVof the event that they're describing.
p154
aa(lp155
VThe bottom line is, time is a powerful force.
p156
aVIt transforms our preferences.
p157
aVIt reshapes our values.
p158
aVIt alters our personalities.
p159
aVWe seem to appreciate this fact,
p160
aVbut only in retrospect.
p161
aVOnly when we look backwards do we realize
p162
aVhow much change happens in a decade.
p163
aVIt's as if, for most of us,
p164
aVthe present is a magic time.
p165
aVIt's a watershed on the timeline.
p166
aVIt's the moment at which we finally
p167
aVbecome ourselves.
p168
aVHuman beings are works in progress
p169
aVthat mistakenly think they're finished.
p170
aVThe person you are right now
p171
aVis as transient, as fleeting and as temporary
p172
aVas all the people you've ever been.
p173
aVThe one constant in our life is change.
p174
aa(lp175
VThank you.

In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone&#39;s eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that <strong>our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy</strong>. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<br /><br />The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert&#39;s writing, which is <strong>lucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny</strong>. The immensely readable <em><a href=\\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Stumbling on Happiness</a>,</em> published in 2006, became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 20 languages.<br /><br />In fact, the title of his book could be drawn from his own life. At 19, he was a high school dropout with dreams of writing science fiction. When a creative writing class at his community college was full, he enrolled in the only available course: psychology. He found his passion there, earned a doctorate in social psychology in 1985 at Princeton, and has since won a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Phi Beta Kappa teaching prize for his work at Harvard. He has written essays and articles for <em>The New York Times, Time</em> and even <a href=\\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/STARBUCKS%20CUP.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Starbucks</a>, while <strong>continuing his research into happiness at his <a href=\\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Hedonic Psychology Laboratory</a>.</strong></p>", "slug": "dan_gilbert", "whotheyare": "Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says our beliefs about what will make us happy are often wrong -- a premise he supports with intriguing research, and explains in his accessible and unexpectedly funny book, <em>Stumbling on Happiness.</em>", "whatotherssay": "Gilbert\'s elbow-in-the-ribs social-science humor is actually funny. ...

in our ardent, lifelong pursuit of happiness, most of us have the wrong map. In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone&#39;s eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that <strong>our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy</strong>. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<br /><br />The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert&#39;s writing, which is <strong>lucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny</strong>. The immensely readable <em><a href=\\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Stumbling on Happiness</a>,</em> published in 2006, became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 20 languages.<br /><br />In fact, the title of his book could be drawn from his own life. At 19, he was a high school dropout with dreams of writing science fiction. When a creative writing class at his community college was full, he enrolled in the only available course: psychology. He found his passion there, earned a doctorate in social psychology in 1985 at Princeton, and has since won a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Phi Beta Kappa teaching prize for his work at Harvard. He has written essays and articles for <em>The New York Times, Time</em> and even <a href=\\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/STARBUCKS%20CUP.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Starbucks</a>, while <strong>continuing his research into happiness at his <a href=\\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Hedonic Psychology Laboratory</a>.</strong></p>", "slug": "dan_gilbert", "whotheyare": "Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says our beliefs about what will make us happy are often wrong -- a premise he supports with intriguing research, and explains in his accessible and unexpectedly funny book, <em>Stumbling on Happiness.</em>", "whatotherssay": "Gilbert\'s elbow-in-the-ribs social-science humor is actually funny. ...

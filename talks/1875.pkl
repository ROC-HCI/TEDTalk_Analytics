p5
aVMr. Henry Evans.

VHenry Evans: Hello.
p10
aVMy name is Henry Evans,
p11
aVand until August 29, 2002,
p12
aVI was living my version of the American dream.
p13
aVI grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis.
p14
aVMy dad was a lawyer.
p15
aVMy mom was a homemaker.
p16
aVMy six siblings and I were good kids,
p17
aVbut caused our fair share of trouble.
p18
aVAfter high school, I left home to study
p19
aVand learn more about the world.
p20
aVI went to Notre Dame University
p21
aVand graduated with degrees in accounting and German,
p22
aVincluding spending a year of study in Austria.
p23
aVLater on, I earned an MBA at Stanford.
p24
aVI married my high school sweetheart, Jane.
p25
aVI am lucky to have her.
p26
aVTogether, we raised four wonderful children.
p27
aVI worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder,
p28
aVeventually becoming a chief financial officer
p29
aVin Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.
p30
aVMy family and I bought our first and only home
p31
aVon December 13, 2001,
p32
aVa fixer-upper in a beautiful spot
p33
aVof Los Altos Hills, California,
p34
aVfrom where I am speaking to you now.
p35
aa(lp36
VWe were looking forward to rebuilding it,
p37
aVbut eight months after we moved in,
p38
aVI suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect.
p39
aVOvernight, I became a mute quadriplegic
p40
aVat the ripe old age of 40.
p41
aVIt took me several years,
p42
aVbut with the help of an incredibly supportive family,
p43
aVI finally decided life was still worth living.
p44
aVI became fascinated with using technology
p45
aVto help the severely disabled.
p46
aVHead tracking devices sold commercially
p47
aVby the company Madentec
p48
aVconvert my tiny head movements into cursor movements,
p49
aVand enable my use of a regular computer.
p50
aVI can surf the web, exchange email with people,
p51
aVand routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins
p52
aVin online word games.
p53
aVThis technology allows me to remain engaged,
p54
aVmentally active,
p55
aVand feel like I am a part of the world.
p56
aa(lp57
VOne day, I was lying in bed watching CNN,
p58
aVwhen I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp
p59
aVof the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech
p60
aVdemonstrating a PR2 robot.
p61
aVI emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage,
p62
aVand we formed the Robots for Humanity project.
p63
aVFor about two years, Robots for Humanity
p64
aVdeveloped ways for me to use the PR2
p65
aVas my body surrogate.
p66
aVI shaved myself for the first time in 10 years.
p67
aVFrom my home in California,
p68
aVI shaved Charlie in Atlanta. (Laughter)
p69
aVI handed out Halloween candy.
p70
aVI opened my refrigerator on my own.
p71
aVI began doing tasks around the house.
p72
aVI saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities
p73
aVto live and contribute,
p74
aVboth for myself and others in my circumstance.
p75
aa(lp76
VAll of us have disabilities in one form or another.
p77
aVFor example, if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour,
p78
aVboth of us will need an assistive device called a car.
p79
aVYour disability doesn't make you any less of a person,
p80
aVand neither does mine.
p81
aVBy the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter)
p82
aVSince birth, we have both suffered from the inability
p83
aVto fly on our own.
p84
aa(lp85
VLast year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage
p86
aVconnected with me Chad Jenkins.
p87
aVChad showed me how easy it is
p88
aVto purchase and fly aerial drones.
p89
aVIt was then I realized that I could also use
p90
aVan aerial drone to expand the worlds
p91
aVof bedridden people through flight,
p92
aVgiving a sense of movement and control
p93
aVthat is incredible.
p94
aVUsing a mouse cursor I control with my head,
p95
aVthese web interfaces allow me
p96
aVto see video from the robot
p97
aVand send control commands
p98
aVby pressing buttons in a web browser.
p99
aVWith a little practice, I became good enough with this interface
p100
aVto drive around my home on my own.
p101
aVI could look around our garden
p102
aVand see the grapes we are growing.
p103
aVI inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter)
p104
aVOne of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone
p105
aVon our basketball hoop.
p106
aVI went even further by seeing if I could use
p107
aVa head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift,
p108
aVas modified by Fighting Walrus,
p109
aVto have an immersive experience
p110
aVcontrolling the drone.
p111
aVWith Chad's group at Brown,
p112
aVI regularly fly drones around his lab
p113
aVseveral times a week, from my home 3,000 miles away.
p114
aVAll work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic,
p115
aVso we also find time to play friendly games
p116
aVof robot soccer. (Laughter)
p117
aVI never thought I would be able to casually
p118
aVmove around a campus like Brown on my own.
p119
aVI just wish I could afford the tuition. (Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VChad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside,
p122
aVI bet all of these people here
p123
aVwould love to see you fly this drone
p124
aVfrom your bed in California 3,000 miles away.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VOkay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately?
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VAre you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic?
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p135
aa(lp136
VCan you show us how excited you are?
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VAll right, big finish.
p141
aVCan you show us how good of a pilot you are?
p142
aa(lp143
V(Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VAll right, we still have a little ways to go with that,
p146
aVbut I think it shows the promise.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhat makes Henry's story amazing
p149
aVis it's about understanding Henry's needs,
p150
aVunderstanding what people in Henry's situation
p151
aVneed from technology,
p152
aVand then also understanding
p153
aVwhat advanced technology can provide,
p154
aVand then bringing those two things together
p155
aVfor use in a wise and responsible way.
p156
aVWhat we're trying to do is democratize robotics,
p157
aVso that anybody can be a part of this.
p158
aVWe're providing affordable, off-the-shelf robot platforms
p159
aVsuch as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars,
p160
aVthe Suitable Technologies beam, only 17,000 dollars,
p161
aValong with open-source robotics software
p162
aVso that you can be a part of what we're trying to do.
p163
aVAnd our hope is that, by providing these tools,
p164
aVthat you'll be able to think of better ways
p165
aVto provide movement for the disabled,
p166
aVto provide care for our aging population,
p167
aVto help better educate our children,
p168
aVto think about what the new types
p169
aVof middle class jobs could be for the future,
p170
aVto both monitor and protect our environment,
p171
aVand to explore the universe.
p172
aa(lp173
VBack to you, Henry.
p174
aa(lp175
VHE: Thank you, Chad.
p176
aa(lp177
VWith this drone setup, we show the potential
p178
aVfor bedridden people to once again be able
p179
aVto explore the outside world,
p180
aVand robotics will eventually provide
p181
aVa level playing field
p182
aVwhere one is only limited by their mental acuity
p183
aVand imagination,
p184
aVwhere the disabled are able to perform
p185
aVthe same activities as everyone else,
p186
aVand perhaps better,
p187
aVand technology will even allow us to provide
p188
aVan outlet for many people who are presently
p189
aVconsidered vegetables.
p190
aVOne hundred years ago,
p191
aVI would have been treated like a vegetable.
p192
aVActually, that's not true.
p193
aVI would have died.
p194
aa(lp195
VIt is up to us, all of us, to decide how
p196
aVrobotics will be used, for good or for evil,
p197
aVfor simply replacing people
p198
aVor for making people better,
p199
aVfor allowing us to do and enjoy more.
p200
aa(lp201
VOur goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power
p202
aVby making the world more physically accessible
p203
aVto people such as myself and others like me
p204
aVaround the globe.
p205
aVWith the help of people like you,
p206
aVwe can make this dream a reality.
p207
aa(lp208
VThank you.

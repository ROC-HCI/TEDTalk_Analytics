VI know this is going to sound strange,
p5
aVbut I think robots can inspire us to be better humans.
p6
aVSee, I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
p7
aVthe home of Bethlehem Steel.
p8
aVMy father was an engineer,
p9
aVand when I was growing up, he would teach me how things worked.
p10
aVWe would build projects together,
p11
aVlike model rockets and slot cars.
p12
aVHere's the go-kart that we built together.
p13
aVThat's me behind the wheel,
p14
aVwith my sister and my best friend at the time.
p15
aVAnd one day,
p16
aVhe came home, when I was about 10 years old,
p17
aVand at the dinner table, he announced
p18
aVthat for our next project,  we were going to build ...
p19
aVa robot.
p20
aa(lp21
VA robot.
p22
aVNow, I was thrilled about this,
p23
aVbecause at school, there was a bully named Kevin,
p24
aVand he was picking on me,
p25
aVbecause I was the only Jewish kid in class.
p26
aVSo I couldn't wait to get started to work on this,
p27
aVso I could introduce Kevin to my robot.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
V(Robot noises)
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VBut that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VSee, he owned a chromium-plating company,
p40
aVand they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals.
p41
aVAnd so he needed an industrial robot like this,
p42
aVthat could basically do the heavy lifting.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted, either.
p45
aVHe and I worked on it for several years,
p46
aVbut it was the 1970s, and the technology that was available to amateurs
p47
aVjust wasn't there yet.
p48
aVSo Dad continued to do this kind of work by hand.
p49
aVAnd a few years later,
p50
aVhe was diagnosed with cancer.
p51
aa(lp52
VYou see,
p53
aVwhat the robot we were trying to build was telling him
p54
aVwas not about doing the heavy lifting.
p55
aVIt was a warning
p56
aVabout his exposure to the toxic chemicals.
p57
aVHe didn't recognize that at the time,
p58
aVand he contracted leukemia.
p59
aVAnd he died at the age of 45.
p60
aVI was devastated by this.
p61
aVAnd I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build.
p62
aVWhen I was at college, I decided to study engineering, like him.
p63
aVAnd I went to Carnegie Mellon, and I earned my PhD in robotics.
p64
aVI've been studying robots ever since.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo what I'd like to tell you about are four robot projects,
p67
aVand how they've inspired me to be a better human.
p68
aVBy 1993, I was a young professor at USC,
p69
aVand I was just building up my own robotics lab,
p70
aVand this was the year the World Wide Web came out.
p71
aVAnd I remember my students were the ones who told me about it,
p72
aVand we would \u2014 we were just amazed.
p73
aVWe started playing with this, and that afternoon,
p74
aVwe realized that we could use this new, universal interface
p75
aVto allow anyone in the world to operate the robot in our lab.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo, rather than have it fight or do industrial work,
p78
aVwe decided to build a planter,
p79
aVput the robot into the center of it,
p80
aVand we called it the Telegarden.
p81
aVAnd we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot,
p82
aVand we wrote some special scripts and software,
p83
aVso that anyone in the world could come in,
p84
aVand by clicking on the screen,
p85
aVthey could move the robot around and visit the garden.
p86
aVBut we also set up some other software
p87
aVthat lets you participate and help us water the garden, remotely.
p88
aVAnd if you watered it a few times,
p89
aVwe'd give you your own seed to plant.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, this was an engineering project,
p92
aVand we published some papers on the system design of it,
p93
aVbut we also thought of it as an art installation.
p94
aVIt was invited, after the first year,
p95
aVby the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria,
p96
aVto have it installed in their lobby.
p97
aVAnd I'm happy to say, it remained online there, 24 hours a day,
p98
aVfor almost nine years.
p99
aVThat robot was operated by more people
p100
aVthan any other robot in history.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, one day,
p103
aVI got a call out of the blue from a student,
p104
aVwho asked a very simple but profound question.
p105
aVHe said, "Is the robot real?"
p106
aVNow, everyone else had assumed it was,
p107
aVand we knew it was, because we were working with it.
p108
aVBut I knew what he meant,
p109
aVbecause it would be possible
p110
aVto take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden
p111
aVand then, basically, index them in a computer system,
p112
aVsuch that it would appear that there was a real robot,
p113
aVwhen there wasn't.
p114
aVAnd the more I thought about it,
p115
aVI couldn't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference.
p116
aa(lp117
VThis was right about the time that I was offered a position
p118
aVhere at Berkeley.
p119
aVAnd when I got here,
p120
aVI looked up Hubert Dreyfus,
p121
aVwho's a world-renowned professor of philosophy,
p122
aVAnd I talked with him about this and he said,
p123
aV"This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy.
p124
aVIt goes back to the Skeptics and up through Descartes.
p125
aVIt's the issue of epistemology,
p126
aVthe study of how do we know that something is true."
p127
aa(lp128
VSo he and I started working together,
p129
aVand we coined a new term: "telepistemology,"
p130
aVthe study of knowledge at a distance.
p131
aVWe invited leading artists, engineers and philosophers
p132
aVto write essays about this,
p133
aVand the results are collected in this book from MIT Press.
p134
aVSo thanks to this student,
p135
aVwho questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true,
p136
aVthis project taught me an important lesson about life,
p137
aVwhich is to always question assumptions.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, the second project I'll tell you about
p140
aVgrew out of the Telegarden.
p141
aVAs it was operating, my students and I were very interested
p142
aVin how people were interacting with each other,
p143
aVand what they were doing with the garden.
p144
aVSo we started thinking:
p145
aVwhat if the robot could leave the garden
p146
aVand go out into some other interesting environment?
p147
aVLike, for example, what if it could go to a dinner party
p148
aVat the White House?
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VSo, because we were interested more in the system design
p153
aVand the user interface than in the hardware,
p154
aVwe decided that,
p155
aVrather than have a robot replace the human to go to the party,
p156
aVwe'd have a human replace the robot.
p157
aVWe called it the Tele-Actor.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe got a human,
p160
aVsomeone who's very outgoing and gregarious,
p161
aVand she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment,
p162
aVcameras and microphones,
p163
aVand then a backpack with wireless Internet connection.
p164
aVAnd the idea was that she could go
p165
aVinto a remote and interesting environment,
p166
aVand then over the Internet,
p167
aVpeople could experience what she was experiencing.
p168
aVSo they could see what she was seeing,
p169
aVbut then, more importantly, they could participate,
p170
aVby interacting with each other and coming up with ideas
p171
aVabout what she should do next and where she should go,
p172
aVand then conveying those to the Tele-Actor.
p173
aVSo we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor
p174
aVto the Webby Awards in San Francisco.
p175
aVAnd that year, Sam Donaldson was the host.
p176
aVJust before the curtain went up, I had about 30 seconds
p177
aVto explain to Mr. Donaldson what we were going to do.
p178
aVAnd I said, "The Tele-Actor is going to be joining you onstage.
p179
aVThis is a new experimental project,
p180
aVand people are watching her on their screens,
p181
aVthere's cameras involved and there's microphones
p182
aVand she's got an earbud in her ear,
p183
aVand people over the network are giving her advice
p184
aVabout what to do next."
p185
aVAnd he said, "Wait a second.
p186
aVThat's what I do."
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VSo he loved the concept,
p191
aVand when the Tele-Actor walked onstage, she walked right up to him,
p192
aVand she gave him a big kiss right on the lips.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VWe were totally surprised \u2014 we had no idea that would happen.
p197
aVAnd he was great, he just gave her a big hug in return,
p198
aVand it worked out great.
p199
aVBut that night, as we were packing up,
p200
aVI asked the Tele-Actor, how did the Tele-Directors decide
p201
aVthat they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson?
p202
aVAnd she said they hadn't.
p203
aVShe said, when she was just about to walk onstage,
p204
aVthe Tele-Directors still were trying to agree on what to do,
p205
aVand so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VSo, the success of the Tele-Actor that night
p210
aVwas due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor.
p211
aVShe knew when to trust her instincts.
p212
aVAnd so that project taught me another lesson about life,
p213
aVwhich is that, when in doubt, improvise.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VNow, the third project grew out of my experience
p218
aVwhen my father was in the hospital.
p219
aVHe was undergoing a treatment \u2014 chemotherapy treatments \u2014
p220
aVand there's a related treatment called brachytherapy,
p221
aVwhere tiny, radioactive seeds are placed into the body
p222
aVto treat cancerous tumors.
p223
aVAnd the way it's done, as you can see here,
p224
aVis that surgeons insert needles into the body
p225
aVto deliver the seeds.
p226
aVAnd all these needles are inserted in parallel.
p227
aVSo it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs.
p228
aVAnd as a result, the needles damage these organs, cause damage,
p229
aVwhich leads to trauma and side effects.
p230
aVSo my students and I wondered:
p231
aVwhat if we could modify the system,
p232
aVso that the needles could come in at different angles?
p233
aa(lp234
VSo we simulated this;
p235
aVwe developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this.
p236
aVAnd we were able to show
p237
aVthat we are able to avoid the delicate organs,
p238
aVand yet still achieve the coverage of the tumors with the radiation.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo now, we're working with doctors at UCSF
p241
aVand engineers at Johns Hopkins,
p242
aVand we're building a robot that has a number of \u2014
p243
aVit's a specialized design with different joints
p244
aVthat can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles.
p245
aVAnd as you can see here, they can avoid delicate organs
p246
aVand still reach the targets they're aiming for.
p247
aVSo, by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel,
p248
aVthis project also taught me an important lesson:
p249
aVWhen in doubt, when your path is blocked, pivot.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd the last project also has to do with medical robotics.
p252
aVAnd this is something that's grown out of a system
p253
aVcalled the da Vinci surgical robot.
p254
aVAnd this is a commercially available device.
p255
aVIt's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world.
p256
aVThe idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably
p257
aVin his own coordinate frame.
p258
aVMany of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious, like suturing,
p259
aVand currently, all of these are performed
p260
aVunder the specific and immediate control of the surgeon.
p261
aVSo the surgeon becomes fatigued over time.
p262
aVAnd we've been wondering,
p263
aVwhat if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks,
p264
aVand thereby free the surgeon
p265
aVto focus on the more complicated parts of the surgery,
p266
aVand also cut down on the time that the surgery would take
p267
aVif we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster?
p268
aa(lp269
VNow, it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this.
p270
aVBut it turns out my colleague Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley,
p271
aVhas developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example.
p272
aVSo he's gotten robots to fly helicopters,
p273
aVdo incredibly interesting, beautiful acrobatics,
p274
aVby watching human experts fly them.
p275
aVSo we got one of these robots.
p276
aVWe started working with Pieter and his students.
p277
aVAnd we asked a surgeon to perform a task \u2014
p278
aVwith the robot.
p279
aVSo what we're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task,
p280
aVand we record the motions of the robot.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo here's an example.
p283
aVI'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example.
p284
aVSo here's what it looks like when the robot \u2014
p285
aVthis is what the robot's path looks like, those three examples.
p286
aVNow, those are much better than what a novice like me could do,
p287
aVbut they're still jerky and imprecise.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo we record all these examples, the data,
p290
aVand then go through a sequence of steps.
p291
aVFirst, we use a technique called dynamic time warping
p292
aVfrom speech recognition.
p293
aVAnd this allows us to temporally align all of the examples.
p294
aVAnd then we apply Kalman filtering, a technique from control theory,
p295
aVthat allows us to statistically analyze all the noise
p296
aVand extract the desired trajectory that underlies them.
p297
aVNow we take those human demonstrations \u2014
p298
aVthey're all noisy and imperfect \u2014
p299
aVand we extract from them an inferred task trajectory
p300
aVand control sequence for the robot.
p301
aVWe then execute that on the robot,
p302
aVwe observe what happens,
p303
aVthen we adjust the controls,
p304
aVusing a sequence of techniques called iterative learning.
p305
aVThen what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit.
p306
aVWe observe the results, adjust the controls again,
p307
aVand observe what happens.
p308
aVAnd we go through this several rounds.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd here's the result.
p311
aVThat's the inferred task trajectory,
p312
aVand here's the robot moving at the speed of the human.
p313
aVHere's four times the speed of the human.
p314
aVHere's seven times.
p315
aVAnd here's the robot operating at 10 times the speed of the human.
p316
aVSo we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task
p317
aVlike a surgical subtask,
p318
aVat 10 times the speed of a human.
p319
aVSo this project also,
p320
aVbecause of its involved practicing and learning,
p321
aVdoing something over and over again,
p322
aVthis project also has a lesson, which is:
p323
aVif you want to do something well,
p324
aVthere's no substitute for practice, practice, practice.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo these are four of the lessons that I've learned from robots
p327
aVover the years.
p328
aVAnd the field of robotics has gotten much better over time.
p329
aVNowadays, high school students can build robots,
p330
aVlike the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build.
p331
aa(lp332
VBut, it's very \u2014 now ...
p333
aVAnd now, I have a daughter,
p334
aVnamed Odessa.
p335
aVShe's eight years old.
p336
aVAnd she likes robots, too.
p337
aVMaybe it runs in the family.
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VI wish she could meet my dad.
p342
aVAnd now I get to teach her how things work,
p343
aVand we get to build projects together.
p344
aVAnd I wonder what kind of lessons she'll learn from them.
p345
aa(lp346
VRobots are the most human of our machines.
p347
aVThey can't solve all of the world's problems,
p348
aVbut I think they have something important to teach us.
p349
aVI invite all of you
p350
aVto think about the innovations that you're interested in,
p351
aVthe machines that you wish for.
p352
aVAnd think about what they might be telling you.
p353
aVBecause I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations,
p354
aVthe devices we dream about,
p355
aVcan inspire us to be better humans.
p356
aa(lp357
VThank you.

VThe new me is beauty.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aVYeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK,
p8
aVbut if you followed what he said, everything would be usable
p9
aVbut it would be ugly."
p10
aVWell, I didn't have that in mind, so ...
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is neat.
p13
aVThank you for setting up my display.
p14
aVI mean, it's just wonderful.
p15
aVAnd I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for,
p16
aVbut I want it.
p17
aVAnd that's my new life.
p18
aVMy new life is trying to understand what beauty is about,
p19
aVand "pretty," and "emotions."
p20
aVThe new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.
p23
aVIt's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house \u2014
p24
aVbut I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VIn fact, I bought the gold-plated special edition
p29
aVand it comes with a little slip of paper
p30
aVthat says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice."
p31
aVThe acid will ruin the gold plating.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo actually, I took a carton of orange juice
p36
aVand I poured it in the glass to take this picture.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VBeneath it is a wonderful knife.
p41
aVIt's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.
p42
aVFirst of all, look at the shape \u2014 it's just wonderful to look at.
p43
aVSecond of all, it's really beautifully balanced:
p44
aVit holds well, it feels well.
p45
aVAnd third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.
p46
aVIt's a delight to use.
p47
aVAnd so it's got everything, right?
p48
aVIt's beautiful and it's functional.
p49
aVAnd I can tell you stories about it,
p50
aVwhich makes it reflective,
p51
aVand so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.
p52
aVAnd those are the three components.
p53
aa(lp54
VHiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab
p55
aVtook a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it,
p56
aVand on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water
p57
aVwith fish swimming in it.
p58
aVAnd as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table,
p59
aVthe ripples spread out and the fish run away.
p60
aVBut of course, then the ball hits the other side,
p61
aVthe ripples hit the \u2014 poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VIs that a good way to play ping-pong?
p66
aVNo. But is it fun?
p67
aVYeah! Yeah.
p68
aa(lp69
VOr look at Google.
p70
aVIf you type in, oh say, "emotion and design,"
p71
aVyou get 10 pages of results.
p72
aVSo Google just took their logo and they spread it out.
p73
aVInstead of saying, "You got 73,000 results.
p74
aVThis is one through 20. Next,"
p75
aVthey just give you as many o's as there are pages.
p76
aVIt's really simple and subtle.
p77
aVI bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.
p78
aVThat's the subconscious mind
p79
aVthat sort of notices it \u2014 it probably is kind of pleasant
p80
aVand you didn't know why.
p81
aVAnd it's just clever.
p82
aVAnd of course, what's especially good is,
p83
aVif you type "design and emotion,"
p84
aVthe first response out of those 10 pages is my website.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, the weird thing is Google lies,
p89
aVbecause if I type "design and emotion,"
p90
aVit says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."
p91
aVSo, OK.
p92
aVSo I type "design emotion"
p93
aVand my website wasn't first again.
p94
aVIt was third.
p95
aVOh well, different story.
p96
aa(lp97
VThere was this wonderful review in The New York Times
p98
aVabout the MINI Cooper automobile.
p99
aVIt said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.
p100
aVBuy it anyway.
p101
aVIt's so much fun to drive."
p102
aVAnd if you look at the inside of the car \u2014
p103
aVI mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it,
p104
aVthis is me taking a picture while my son is driving \u2014
p105
aVand the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
p106
aVIt's round, it's neat.
p107
aVThe controls work wonderfully.
p108
aVSo that's my new life; it's all about fun.
p109
aa(lp110
VI really have the feeling that pleasant things work better,
p111
aVand that never made any sense to me
p112
aVuntil I finally figured out \u2014 look ...
p113
aVI'm going to put a plank on the ground.
p114
aVSo, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long
p115
aVand I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking,
p116
aVI can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.
p117
aVNo problem.
p118
aVNow I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air \u2014
p119
aVand I'm not going to go near it, thank you.
p120
aVIntense fear paralyzes you.
p121
aVIt actually affects the way the brain works.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down
p124
aVuntil just a few days or hours before the talk,
p125
aVand that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.
p126
aVThat's what fear and anxiety does;
p127
aVit causes you to be \u2014 what's called depth-first processing \u2014
p128
aVto focus, not be distracted.
p129
aVAnd I couldn't force myself across that.
p130
aVNow some people can \u2014 circus workers, steel workers.
p131
aVBut it really changes the way you think.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd then, a psychologist, Alice Isen,
p134
aVdid this wonderful experiment.
p135
aVShe brought students in to solve problems.
p136
aVSo, she'd bring people into the room,
p137
aVand there'd be a string hanging down here
p138
aVand a string hanging down here.
p139
aVIt was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it \u2014
p140
aVsome papers and scissors and stuff.
p141
aVAnd she'd bring them in,
p142
aVand she'd say,
p143
aV"This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.
p144
aVWould you tie those two strings together?"
p145
aVSo they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here
p146
aVand they couldn't reach the other string.
p147
aVStill can't reach it.
p148
aVAnd, basically, none of them could solve it.
p149
aVYou bring in a second group of people,
p150
aVand you say, "Oh, before we start,
p151
aVI got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.
p152
aVWould you like the box of candy?"
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd turns out they liked it, and it made them happy \u2014
p155
aVnot very happy, but a little bit of happy.
p156
aVAnd guess what \u2014 they solved the problem.
p157
aVAnd it turns out that when you're anxious
p158
aVyou squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you
p159
aVmakes you depth-first.
p160
aVAnd when you're happy \u2014 what we call positive valence \u2014
p161
aVyou squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes,
p162
aVwhich makes you a breadth-first problem solver:
p163
aVyou're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.
p164
aVThat's what brainstorming is about, right?
p165
aVWith brainstorming we make you happy, we play games,
p166
aVand we say, "No criticism,"
p167
aVand you get all these weird, neat ideas.
p168
aVBut in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done
p169
aVbecause you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."
p170
aVSo to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?
p171
aVYou've got be anxious.
p172
aVThe brain works differently
p173
aVif you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.
p174
aVYou get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out."
p175
aVNo big deal.
p176
aa(lp177
VThere's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.
p178
aVBiology \u2014 we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors.
p179
aVThat's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits
p180
aVand bright plants, because you eat the fruit
p181
aVand you thereby spread the seed.
p182
aVThere's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.
p183
aVWe dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds,
p184
aVwe dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.
p185
aVWe dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces;
p186
aVwe like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.
p187
aVSo that's the visceral level.
p188
aVIn design, you can express visceral in lots of ways,
p189
aVlike the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.
p190
aVOr the 1963 Jaguar:
p191
aVIt's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time,
p192
aVbut the owners love it.
p193
aVAnd it's beautiful \u2014 it's in the Museum of Modern Art.
p194
aVA water bottle:
p195
aVYou buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.
p196
aVAnd when people are finished, they don't throw it away.
p197
aVThey keep it for \u2014 you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration
p198
aVor maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.
p199
aVIt's all about the visceral experience.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe middle level of processing is the behavioral level
p202
aVand that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.
p203
aVVisceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
p204
aVBehavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
p205
aVAlmost everything we do is subconscious.
p206
aVI'm walking around the stage \u2014 I'm not attending to the control of my legs.
p207
aVI'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious;
p208
aVit has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.
p209
aVMost of what we do is subconscious.
p210
aVAutomatic behavior \u2014 skilled behavior \u2014 is subconscious,
p211
aVcontrolled by the behavioral side.
p212
aVAnd behavioral design is all about feeling in control,
p213
aVwhich includes usability, understanding \u2014
p214
aVbut also the feel and heft.
p215
aa(lp216
VThat's why the Global knives are so neat.
p217
aVThey're so nicely balanced, so sharp,
p218
aVthat you really feel you're in control of the cutting.
p219
aVOr, just driving a high-performance sports car
p220
aVover a demanding curb \u2014
p221
aVagain, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.
p222
aVOr the sensual feeling.
p223
aVThis is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower,
p224
aVand actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.
p225
aVIt will squirt you all around
p226
aVand you can stay in that shower for hours \u2014
p227
aVand not waste water, by the way,
p228
aVbecause it recirculates the same dirty water.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VOr this \u2014 this is a really neat teapot I found
p233
aVat high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
p234
aVIt's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.
p235
aVThat's kind of what the teapot looks like
p236
aVbut the way you use it is you lay it on its back,
p237
aVand you put tea in,
p238
aVand then you fill it with water.
p239
aVThe water then seeps over the tea.
p240
aVAnd the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right \u2014
p241
aVthe tea is to the right of this line.
p242
aVThere's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there
p243
aVand the water is filling it up like that.
p244
aVAnd when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
p245
aVAnd that means the tea is partially covered
p246
aVwhile it completes the brewing.
p247
aVAnd when it's finished, you put it vertically,
p248
aVand now the tea is \u2014 you remember \u2014 above this line
p249
aVand the water only comes to here \u2014
p250
aVand so it keeps the tea out.
p251
aVOn top of that, it communicates,
p252
aVwhich is what emotion does.
p253
aa(lp254
VEmotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.
p255
aVIt's being safe in the world.
p256
aVCognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it \u2014
p257
aVsaying good, bad, safe, dangerous,
p258
aVand getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.
p259
aVAnd that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else \u2014
p260
aVbecause their muscles are acting, subconsciously,
p261
aVexcept that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.
p262
aVWell, this has emotions if you like,
p263
aVbecause it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See \u2014 upright."
p264
aVAnd the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"
p265
aVIt's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd the third level is reflective,
p268
aVwhich is, if you like the superego,
p269
aVit's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do,
p270
aVno control over the \u2014 doesn't see the senses,
p271
aVdoesn't control the muscles.
p272
aVIt looks over what's going on.
p273
aVIt's that little voice in your head
p274
aVthat's watching and saying, "That's good. That's bad."
p275
aVOr, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand."
p276
aVIt's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness.
p277
aa(lp278
VHere's a great reflective product.
p279
aVOwners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life \u2014
p280
aVall sorts of exotic cars,
p281
aVbut never have I had a car that attracted so much attention."
p282
aVIt's about attention. It's about their image,
p283
aVnot about the car.
p284
aVIf you want a more positive model \u2014
p285
aVthis is the GM car.
p286
aVAnd the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.
p287
aVAnd you'll buy it to protect the environment,
p288
aVeven though the first few cars are going to be really expensive
p289
aVand not perfected.
p290
aVBut that's reflective design as well.
p291
aVOr an expensive watch, so you can impress people \u2014
p292
aV"Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch."
p293
aVAs opposed to this one,
p294
aVwhich is a pure behavioral watch,
p295
aVwhich probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.
p296
aVBut it's ugly.
p297
aVThis is a clear Don Norman watch.
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other,
p300
aVthe visceral fear of falling
p301
aVagainst the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe."
p302
aVIf that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.
p303
aVSo, it's pitting one against the other.
p304
aVThe other neat thing ...
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VSo Jake Cress is this furniture maker,
p309
aVand he makes this unbelievable set of furniture.
p310
aVAnd this is his chair with claw,
p311
aVand the poor little chair has lost its ball
p312
aVand it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.
p313
aVAnd what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.
p314
aVAnd that's what's nice about emotion.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo that's the new me.
p317
aVI'm only saying positive things from now on.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320

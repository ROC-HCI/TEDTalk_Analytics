VWhat I want to talk to you about today
p5
aVis some of the problems that the military of the Western world \u2014
p6
aVAustralia, United States, the UK and so on \u2014
p7
aVface in some of the deployments that they're dealing with
p8
aVin the modern world at this time.
p9
aVIf you think about the sorts of things
p10
aVwe've sent Australian military personnel to in recent years,
p11
aVwe've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan,
p12
aVbut you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands,
p13
aVand so on.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd a lot of these deployments
p16
aVthat we're sending military personnel to these days
p17
aVaren't traditional wars.
p18
aVIn fact, a lot of the jobs we're asking military personnel to do
p19
aVin those situations
p20
aVare ones that, in their own countries \u2014 Australia, the US and so on \u2014
p21
aVwould actually be done by police officers.
p22
aVSo there's a bunch of problems that come up
p23
aVfor military personnel in these situations,
p24
aVbecause they're doing things they haven't really been trained for.
p25
aVAnd they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries
p26
aVare trained very differently for and equipped very differently for.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, there's a bunch of reasons why we send military personnel,
p29
aVrather than police, to do these jobs.
p30
aVIf Australia had to send 1,000 people tomorrow
p31
aVto West Papua, for example,
p32
aVwe don't have 1,000 police officers hanging around that could go tomorrow,
p33
aVand we do have 1,000 soldiers that could go.
p34
aVSo when we have to send someone, we send the military \u2014
p35
aVthey're there, they're available,
p36
aVand heck, they're used to going off and doing these things
p37
aVand living by themselves
p38
aVand not having all this extra support.
p39
aVSo they are able to do it in that sense.
p40
aVBut they aren't trained the same way police officers are,
p41
aVand they're certainly not equipped the way police officers are,
p42
aVso this has raised a bunch of problems for them
p43
aVwhen dealing with these issues.
p44
aa(lp45
VOne particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in,
p46
aVis the question of whether,
p47
aVwhen we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs,
p48
aVwe ought to be equipping them differently;
p49
aVand in particular, whether we ought to be giving them access
p50
aVto some of the nonlethal weapons that police have.
p51
aVSince they're doing some of the same jobs,
p52
aVmaybe they should have some of those things.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd there's a range of places you'd think those things would be really useful.
p55
aVFor example, when you've got military checkpoints.
p56
aVIf people are approaching these checkpoints
p57
aVand the military personnel are unsure if this person's hostile or not,
p58
aVsay this person approaching here, and they say,
p59
aV"Is this a suicide bomber or not?
p60
aVIs something hidden under their clothes?
p61
aVWhat's going to happen?"
p62
aVThey don't know if the person is hostile or not.
p63
aVIf the person doesn't follow directions, they may end up shooting them,
p64
aVand then find out afterwards either, yes, we shot the right person,
p65
aVor, no, this was just an innocent person
p66
aVwho didn't understand what was going on.
p67
aVSo if they had nonlethal weapons, then they would say,
p68
aV"We can use them in that sort of situation.
p69
aVIf we shoot someone who wasn't hostile,
p70
aVat least we haven't killed them."
p71
aa(lp72
VAnother situation: this photo is from one of the missions
p73
aVin the Balkans in the late 1990s.
p74
aVThis situation is a little bit different,
p75
aVwhere maybe they know someone is hostile;
p76
aVthey've got someone shooting at them
p77
aVor doing something else that's clearly hostile,
p78
aVthrowing rocks, whatever.
p79
aVBut if they respond,
p80
aVthere's a range of other people around who are innocent people,
p81
aVwho might also get hurt.
p82
aVIt'd be collateral damage
p83
aVthat the military often doesn't want to talk about.
p84
aVSo again, they'd say, "With access to nonlethal weapons,
p85
aVif we've got someone we know is hostile,
p86
aVwe can do something to deal with them,
p87
aVand know that if we hit anyone else,
p88
aVat least we're not going to kill them."
p89
aa(lp90
VAnother suggestion has been,
p91
aVsince we're putting so many robots in the field,
p92
aVwe can see the time coming
p93
aVwhere they're actually going to send robots out in the field
p94
aVthat are autonomous.
p95
aVThey'll make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot,
p96
aVwithout a human in the loop.
p97
aVSo the suggestion is,
p98
aVif we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this,
p99
aVmaybe it would be a good idea if they were armed with nonlethal weapons,
p100
aVso if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person,
p101
aVagain, they haven't actually killed them.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, there's a whole range of different sorts of nonlethal weapons,
p104
aVsome of which are available now,
p105
aVsome of which they're developing.
p106
aVYou've got traditional things like pepper spray,
p107
aVOC spray up at the top there,
p108
aVor Tasers over here.
p109
aVThe one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser,
p110
aVintended to just blind the person momentarily
p111
aVand disorient them.
p112
aVYou've got nonlethal shotgun rounds
p113
aVthat contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones.
p114
aVAnd this one in the middle here, the large truck,
p115
aVis called the Active Denial System,
p116
aVsomething the US military is working on at the moment.
p117
aa(lp118
VIt's essentially a big microwave transmitter.
p119
aVIt's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray.
p120
aVIt goes out to a really long distance,
p121
aVcompared to any of these other sorts of things.
p122
aVAnybody who is hit with this feels a sudden burst of heat,
p123
aVand just wants to get out of the way.
p124
aVIt is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven,
p125
aVbut it basically is boiling the water molecules
p126
aVin the very surface level of your skin.
p127
aVSo you feel this massive heat,
p128
aVand you go, "I want to get out of the way."
p129
aVAnd they think this will be really useful
p130
aVin places where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area,
p131
aVif the crowd is being hostile.
p132
aVIf we need to keep people away from a particular place,
p133
aVwe can do that with these sorts of things.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo there's a whole range of different nonlethal weapons
p136
aVwe could give military personnel,
p137
aVand there's a whole range of situations
p138
aVwhere they're looking at them and saying,
p139
aV"These things would be really useful."
p140
aVBut as I said,
p141
aVthe military and the police are very different.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VYes, you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize
p146
aVthat they might be very different.
p147
aVIn particular,
p148
aVthe attitude to the use of force
p149
aVand the way they're trained to use force
p150
aVis especially different.
p151
aa(lp152
VThe police \u2014
p153
aVand knowing because I've actually helped to train police \u2014
p154
aVpolice, particularly in Western jurisdictions at least,
p155
aVare trained to De-escalate force,
p156
aVto try and avoid using force wherever possible,
p157
aVand to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort.
p158
aVMilitary personnel are being trained for war.
p159
aVSo they're trained that, as soon as things go bad,
p160
aVtheir first response is lethal force.
p161
aVThe moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine \u2014
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
Vyou can start shooting at people.
p166
aVSo their attitudes
p167
aVto the use of lethal force are very different,
p168
aVand I think it's fairly obvious
p169
aVthat their attitude to the use of nonlethal weapons
p170
aVwould also be very different from what it is with the police.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd since we've already had so many problems
p173
aVwith police use of nonlethal weapons in various ways,
p174
aVI thought it would be a good idea to look at some of those things
p175
aVand relate it to the military context.
p176
aVI was very surprised when I started to do this to see that, in fact,
p177
aVeven the people who advocated the use of nonlethal weapons by the military
p178
aVhadn't actually done that.
p179
aVThey generally seemed to think,
p180
aV"Why would we care what's happened with the police?
p181
aVWe're looking at something different,"
p182
aVand didn't seem to recognize
p183
aVthey were looking at pretty much the same stuff.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo I started to investigate some of those issues,
p186
aVand have a look at the way police use nonlethal weapons
p187
aVwhen they're introduced,
p188
aVand some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things
p189
aVwhen they actually do introduce them.
p190
aVAnd of course, being Australian,
p191
aVI started looking at stuff in Australia, knowing from my own experience
p192
aVof various times when nonlethal weapons have been introduced in Australia.
p193
aa(lp194
VOne of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray \u2014
p195
aVoleoresin capsicum spray, pepper spray \u2014
p196
aVby Australian police,
p197
aVand seeing what had happened when that had been introduced,
p198
aVand those sorts of issues.
p199
aVAnd one study that I found, a particularly interesting one,
p200
aVwas in Queensland,
p201
aVbecause they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray
p202
aVbefore they actually introduced it more broadly.
p203
aVAnd I went and had a look at some of the figures here.
p204
aVNow, when they introduced OC spray in Queensland,
p205
aVthey were really explicit.
p206
aVThe police minister's and a heap of public statements were made about it.
p207
aVThey were saying, "This is explicitly intended to give police an option
p208
aVbetween shouting and shooting.
p209
aVThis is something they can use instead of a firearm
p210
aVin situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone."
p211
aa(lp212
VSo I looked at all of the police shooting figures.
p213
aVAnd you can't actually find them very easily
p214
aVfor individual Australian states;
p215
aVI could only find these.
p216
aVThis is from an Australian Institute of Criminology report.
p217
aVYou can see, in the fine print at the top:
p218
aV"Police shooting deaths" means not just people shot by police,
p219
aVbut people who have shot themselves in the presence of police.
p220
aVBut these are the figures across the entire country,
p221
aVand the red arrow represents the point where Queensland said,
p222
aV"Yes, this is where we're going to give
p223
aVall police officers across the entire state
p224
aVaccess to OC spray."
p225
aVSo you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it,
p226
aVevery year for a number of years.
p227
aVThere was a spike a few years before,
p228
aVbut that wasn't actually Queensland.
p229
aVAnyone know where that was?
p230
aVWasn't Port Arthur, no.
p231
aVVictoria? Yes, correct.
p232
aVThat spike was all Victoria.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VSo it wasn't that Queensland had a particular problem
p237
aVwith deaths from police shootings and so on.
p238
aVSo, six shootings across the whole country,
p239
aVfairly consistently over the years before.
p240
aa(lp241
VThe next two years were the years they studied \u2014 2001, 2002.
p242
aVAnyone want to take a stab at the number of times,
p243
aVgiven how they've introduced this,
p244
aVthe number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period?
p245
aVHundreds? One? Three?
p246
aVA thousand is getting better.
p247
aVExplicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force \u2014
p248
aVan alternative between shouting and shooting.
p249
aVI'm going to go out on a limb here
p250
aVand say that if Queensland police didn't have OC spray,
p251
aVthey wouldn't have shot 2,226 people
p252
aVin those two years.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VIn fact, if you have a look at the studies they were looking at,
p257
aVthe material they were collecting and examining,
p258
aVyou can see the suspects were only armed in about 15 percent of cases
p259
aVwhere OC spray was used.
p260
aa(lp261
VIt was routinely being used in this period,
p262
aVand, of course, still is routinely used \u2014
p263
aVbecause there were no complaints about it,
p264
aVnot within the context of this study, anyway \u2014
p265
aVit was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent,
p266
aVwho were potentially violent,
p267
aVand also quite frequently used
p268
aVto deal with people who were simply passively noncompliant.
p269
aVThis person is not doing anything violent,
p270
aVbut they just won't do what we want them to.
p271
aVThey're not obeying the directions we're giving them,
p272
aVso we'll give them a shot of the OC spray \u2014 that'll speed them up.
p273
aVEverything will work out better that way.
p274
aVThis was something explicitly introduced
p275
aVto be an alternative to firearms,
p276
aVbut it's being routinely used
p277
aVto deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems.
p278
aa(lp279
VNow one of the particular issues that comes up
p280
aVwith military use of nonlethal weapons \u2014
p281
aVand people actually say, "There might be some problems" \u2014
p282
aVthere's a couple of particular problems that get focused on.
p283
aVOne of those problems is: nonlethal weapons may be used indiscriminately.
p284
aVOne of the fundamental principles of military use of force
p285
aVis that you have to be discriminate;
p286
aVyou have to be careful about who you're shooting at.
p287
aVSo one of the problems suggested with nonlethal weapons
p288
aVis that they might be used indiscriminately \u2014
p289
aVthat you would use them against a whole range of people,
p290
aVbecause you don't have to worry so much anymore.
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd in fact, one particular instance where I think that actually happens
p293
aVwas the Dubrovka Theater siege in Moscow in 2002,
p294
aVwhich probably a lot of you, unlike most of my students at ADFA,
p295
aVare old enough to remember.
p296
aVSo, Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater.
p297
aVThey were holding something like 700 people hostage.
p298
aVThey'd released a bunch of people,
p299
aVbut they still had about 700 people hostage.
p300
aVAnd the Russian military police special forces, "Spetsnaz,"
p301
aVcame in and stormed the theater.
p302
aVThe way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas.
p303
aVAnd it turned out that lots of the hostages died
p304
aVas a result of inhaling the gas.
p305
aVIt was used indiscriminately.
p306
aVThey pumped the whole theater full of the gas.
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd it's no surprise that people died,
p309
aVbecause you don't know how much gas each person is going to inhale,
p310
aVwhat position they'll fall in when they become unconscious, and so on.
p311
aVThere were, in fact, only a couple of people who got shot
p312
aVin this episode.
p313
aVSo when they had a look at it afterward,
p314
aVthere were only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot,
p315
aVby the hostage takers or by the police forces
p316
aVtrying to deal with the situation.
p317
aVVirtually everybody that got killed
p318
aVgot killed from inhaling the gas.
p319
aVThe final toll of hostages is a little unclear,
p320
aVbut it's certainly a few more than that,
p321
aVbecause other people died over the next few days.
p322
aVSo this was one problem they talked about,
p323
aVthat it might be used indiscriminately.
p324
aa(lp325
VA second problem people sometimes talk about
p326
aVwith military use of nonlethal weapons \u2014
p327
aVand it's actually why, in the chemical weapons convention,
p328
aVit's very clear that you can't use riot-control agents
p329
aVas weapons of warfare \u2014
p330
aVis that it's seen that sometimes nonlethal weapons might be used
p331
aVnot as an alternative to lethal force,
p332
aVbut as a lethal force multiplier:
p333
aVthat you use nonlethal weapons first,
p334
aVso your lethal weapons will actually be more effective.
p335
aVThe people you'll be shooting at won't be able to get out of the way.
p336
aVThey won't be aware of what's happening, and you can kill them better.
p337
aVAnd that's exactly what happened here.
p338
aVThe hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas
p339
aVwere not taken into custody;
p340
aVthey were simply shot in the head.
p341
aVSo this nonlethal weapon was being used in this case
p342
aVas a lethal force multiplier,
p343
aVto make killing more effective in this particular situation.
p344
aa(lp345
VAnother problem I want to quickly mention
p346
aVis that there's a whole heap of problems
p347
aVwith the way people are actually taught to use nonlethal weapons,
p348
aVand get trained about them and then tested and so on.
p349
aVBecause they're tested in nice, safe environments,
p350
aVand are taught to use them in nice, safe environments \u2014
p351
aVlike this, where you can see exactly what's going on.
p352
aVThe person spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove
p353
aVto make sure they don't get contaminated, and so on.
p354
aVBut they're never used like that.
p355
aa(lp356
VThey're used out in the real world,
p357
aVlike in Texas, like this:
p358
aa(lp359
V["Police Taser Great-Grandmother During Traffic Stop"]
p360
aa(lp361
VI confess, this particular case was one that piqued my interest in this.
p362
aVIt happened while I was working as a research fellow
p363
aVat the US Naval Academy.
p364
aVNews reports started coming up about this situation,
p365
aVwhere this woman was arguing with a police officer.
p366
aVShe wasn't violent.
p367
aVIn fact, he was probably six inches taller than me,
p368
aVand she was about this tall.
p369
aVAnd eventually she said to him,
p370
aV"Well, I'm going to get back in my car."
p371
aVAnd he says, "If you get back in your car, I'm going to tase you."
p372
aVAnd she says, "Oh, go ahead. Tase me." And so he does.
p373
aVAnd it's all captured by the video camera
p374
aVrunning in the front of the police car.
p375
aVSo, she's 72.
p376
aVAnd it's seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her.
p377
aa(lp378
VAnd there are other examples of the same sorts of things,
p379
aVwhere you think,
p380
aV"Is this really an appropriate way to use nonlethal weapons?"
p381
aV"Police Chief Fires Taser into 14 year old Girl's Head."
p382
aV"She was running away. What else was I suppose to do?"
p383
aa(lp384
V(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
VOr Florida:
p387
aV"Police Taser 6-year-old Boy at Elementary School."
p388
aVAnd they clearly learned a lot from it, because in the same district:
p389
aV"Police Review Policy After Children Shocked:
p390
aV2nd Child Shocked by Taser Stun Gun Within Weeks."
p391
aVSame police district.
p392
aVAnother child within weeks of Tasering the six-year-old boy.
p393
aa(lp394
VJust in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States,
p395
aVit happened in Canada as well:
p396
aa(lp397
V["Mounties Zap 11-year-old Boy"]
p398
aa(lp399
VAnd a colleague sent me this one from London:
p400
aa(lp401
V["Arrested Man, 82, Shot with Taser"]
p402
aa(lp403
VBut my personal favorite, I have to confess, does come from the US:
p404
aV"Officers Taser 86-year-old Disabled Woman in her Bed."
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
VI checked the reports on this one.
p409
aVI looked at it. I was really surprised.
p410
aVApparently, she took up a more threatening position in her bed.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Laughter)
p413
aa(lp414
VI kid you not, that's exactly what it said:
p415
aV"She took up a more threatening position in her bed."
p416
aVOK.
p417
aa(lp418
VBut I'd remind you \u2014
p419
aVI'm talking about military uses of nonlethal weapons,
p420
aVso why is this relevant?
p421
aVBecause police are actually more restrained in the use of force
p422
aVthan the military are.
p423
aVThey're trained to be more restrained in the use of force
p424
aVthan the military are.
p425
aVThey're trained to think more, to try and De-escalate.
p426
aVSo if you have these problems with police officers
p427
aVwith nonlethal weapons,
p428
aVwhat on earth would make you think
p429
aVit's going to be better with military personnel?
p430
aa(lp431
VThe last thing that I would like to say:
p432
aVWhen I'm talking to the police
p433
aVabout what a perfect nonlethal weapon would look like,
p434
aVthey almost inevitably say the same thing.
p435
aVThey say, "It's got to be something that's nasty enough
p436
aVthat people don't want to be hit with this weapon.
p437
aVSo if you threaten to use it,
p438
aVpeople are going to comply with it.
p439
aVBut it's also going to be something
p440
aVthat doesn't leave any lasting effects."
p441
aVIn other words,

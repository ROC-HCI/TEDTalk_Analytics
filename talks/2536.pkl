VIchthyology,
p5
aVthe study of fishes.
p6
aVIt looks like a big, boring word,
p7
aVbut it's actually quite exciting,
p8
aVbecause ichthyology is the only "ology"
p9
aVwith "YOLO" in it.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, to the cool kids in the audience,
p14
aVyou already know, YOLO stands for "you only live once,"
p15
aVand because I only have one life,
p16
aVI'm going to spend it doing what I always dreamt of doing:
p17
aVseeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species.
p18
aVAnd that's what I get to do.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, in recent years, I really focused on caves for finding new species.
p21
aVAnd it turns out, there's lots of new cavefish species out there.
p22
aVYou just have to know where to look,
p23
aVand to maybe be a little thin.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology.
p28
aVThey can tell me how the landmasses around them have changed and moved
p29
aVby being stuck in these little holes,
p30
aVand they can tell me about the evolution of sight, by being blind.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours.
p33
aVAll vertebrates do, and each time a fish species starts to adapt
p34
aVto this dark, cold, cave environment,
p35
aVover many, many generations, they lose their eyes and their eyesight
p36
aVuntil the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here.
p37
aVNow, each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way,
p38
aVand each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us,
p39
aVand that's why it's so exciting when we find a new species.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo this is a new species we described, from southern Indiana.
p42
aVWe named it Amblyopsis hoosieri, the Hoosier cavefish.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VIts closest relatives are cavefishes in Kentucky,
p47
aVin the Mammoth Cave system.
p48
aVAnd they start to diverge when the Ohio River split them
p49
aVa few million years ago.
p50
aVAnd in that time they developed these subtle differences
p51
aVin the genetic architecture behind their blindness.
p52
aVThere's this gene called rhodopsin that's super-critical for sight.
p53
aVWe have it, and these species have it too,
p54
aVexcept one species has lost all function in that gene,
p55
aVand the other one maintains it.
p56
aVSo this sets up this beautiful natural experiment
p57
aVwhere we can look at the genes behind our vision,
p58
aVand at the very roots of how we can see.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut the genes in these cavefishes
p61
aVcan also tell us about deep geological time,
p62
aVmaybe no more so than in this species here.
p63
aVThis is a new species we described from Madagascar
p64
aVthat we named Typhleotris mararybe.
p65
aVThat means "big sickness" in Malagasy,
p66
aVfor how sick we got trying to collect this species.
p67
aVNow, believe it or not,
p68
aVswimming around sinkholes full of dead things
p69
aVand cave full of bat poop
p70
aVisn't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life,
p71
aVbut YOLO.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, I love this species despite the fact that it tried to kill us,
p76
aVand that's because this species in Madagascar,
p77
aVits closest relatives are 6,000 kilometers away,
p78
aVcavefishes in Australia.
p79
aVNow, there's no way a three-inch-long freshwater cavefish
p80
aVcan swim across the Indian Ocean,
p81
aVso what we found when we compared the DNA of these species
p82
aVis that they've been separated for more than 100 million years,
p83
aVor about the time that the southern continents were last together.
p84
aVSo in fact, these species didn't move at all.
p85
aVIt's the continents that moved them.
p86
aVAnd so they give us, through their DNA,
p87
aVthis precise model and measure
p88
aVof how to date and time these ancient geological events.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, this species here is so new
p91
aVI'm not even allowed to tell you its name yet,
p92
aVbut I can tell you it's a new species from Mexico,
p93
aVand it's probably already extinct.
p94
aVIt's probably extinct because the only known cave system it's from
p95
aVwas destroyed when a dam was built nearby.
p96
aVUnfortunately for cavefishes,
p97
aVtheir groundwater habitat
p98
aVis also our main source of drinking water.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, we actually don't know this species' closest relative, yet.
p101
aVIt doesn't appear to be anything else in Mexico,
p102
aVso maybe it's something in Cuba,
p103
aVor Florida, or India.
p104
aVBut whatever it is, it might tell us something new about the geology
p105
aVof the Caribbean, or the biology of how to better diagnose
p106
aVcertain types of blindness.
p107
aVBut I hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd I'm going to spend my one life
p110
aVas an ichthyologist trying to discover and save
p111
aVthese humble little blind cavefishes
p112
aVthat can tell us so much about the geology of the planet
p113
aVand the biology of how we see.
p114
aa(lp115
VThank you.

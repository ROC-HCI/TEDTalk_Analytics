VI'm going to talk about your mindset.
p5
aVDoes your mindset correspond to my dataset?
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVIf not, one or the other needs upgrading, isn't it?
p8
aa(lp9
VWhen I talk to my students about global issues,
p10
aVand I listen to them in the coffee break,
p11
aVthey always talk about "we" and "them."
p12
aVAnd when they come back into the lecture room
p13
aVI ask them, "What do you mean with "we" and "them"?
p14
aV"Oh, it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world," they say.
p15
aV"We learned it in college."
p16
aVAnd what is the definition then? "The definition?
p17
aVEveryone knows," they say.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut then you know, I press them like this.
p20
aVSo one girl said, very cleverly, "It's very easy.
p21
aVWestern world is a long life in a small family.
p22
aVDeveloping world is a short life in a large family."
p23
aVAnd I like that definition, because it enabled me
p24
aVto transfer their mindset
p25
aVinto the dataset.
p26
aVAnd here you have the dataset.
p27
aVSo, you can see that what we have on this axis here
p28
aVis size of family. One, two, three, four, five
p29
aVchildren per woman on this axis.
p30
aVAnd here, length of life, life expectancy,
p31
aV30, 40, 50.
p32
aVExactly what the students said was their concept about the world.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd really this is about the bedroom.
p35
aVWhether the man and woman decide to have small family,
p36
aVand take care of their kids, and how long they will live.
p37
aVIt's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know,
p38
aVyou can live long.
p39
aVAnd the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted \u2014
p40
aVthe world consisted here, of one set of countries over here,
p41
aVwhich had large families and short life. Developing world.
p42
aVAnd we had one set of countries up there
p43
aVwhich was the western world.
p44
aVThey had small families and long life.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd you are going to see here
p47
aVthe amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime.
p48
aVThen the developing countries applied
p49
aVsoap and water, vaccination.
p50
aVAnd all the developing world started to apply family planning.
p51
aVAnd partly to USA who help to provide
p52
aVtechnical advice and investment.
p53
aVAnd you see all the world moves over to a two child family,
p54
aVand a life with 60 to 70 years.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut some countries remain back in this area here.
p57
aVAnd you can see we still have Afghanistan down here.
p58
aVWe have Liberia. We have Congo.
p59
aVSo we have countries living there.
p60
aVSo the problem I had
p61
aVis that the worldview that my students had
p62
aVcorresponds to reality in the world
p63
aVthe year their teachers were born.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aV(Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd we, in fact, when we have played this over the world.
p68
aVI was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week,
p69
aVand I could see the wrong concept
p70
aVeven active people in United States had,
p71
aVthat they didn't realize the improvement
p72
aVof Mexico there, and China, in relation to United States.
p73
aVLook here when I move them forward.
p74
aVHere we go.
p75
aVThey catch up. There's Mexico.
p76
aVIt's on par with United States in these two social dimensions.
p77
aVThere was less than five percent
p78
aVof the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this.
p79
aVThis great nation, Mexico,
p80
aVhas the problem that arms are coming from North,
p81
aVacross the borders, so they had to stop that,
p82
aVbecause they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut if I would change this axis here,
p85
aVI would instead put income per person.
p86
aVIncome per person. I can put that here.
p87
aVAnd we will then see
p88
aVa completely different picture.
p89
aVBy the way, I'm teaching you
p90
aVhow to use our website, Gapminder World,
p91
aVwhile I'm correcting this,
p92
aVbecause this is a free utility on the net.
p93
aVAnd when I now finally got it right,
p94
aVI can go back 200 years in history.
p95
aVAnd I can find United States up there.
p96
aVAnd I can let the other countries be shown.
p97
aVAnd now I have income per person on this axis.
p98
aVAnd United States only had some, one, two thousand dollars at that time.
p99
aVAnd the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years,
p100
aVon par with Afghanistan today.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd what has happened in the world, I will show now.
p103
aVThis is instead of studying history
p104
aVfor one year at university.
p105
aVYou can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVYou can see how the brown bubbles, which is west Europe,
p108
aVand the yellow one, which is the United States,
p109
aVthey get richer and richer and also
p110
aVstart to get healthier and healthier.
p111
aVAnd this is now 100 years ago,
p112
aVwhere the rest of the world remains behind.
p113
aVHere we come. And that was the influenza.
p114
aVThat's why we are so scared about flu, isn't it?
p115
aVIt's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy.
p116
aVAnd then we come up. Not until
p117
aVindependence started.
p118
aa(lp119
VLook here You have China over there,
p120
aVyou have India over there,
p121
aVand this is what has happened.
p122
aVDid you note there, that we have Mexico up there?
p123
aVMexico is not at all on par with the United States,
p124
aVbut they are quite close.
p125
aVAnd especially, it's interesting to see
p126
aVChina and the United States
p127
aVduring 200 years,
p128
aVbecause I have my oldest son now working for Google,
p129
aVafter Google acquired this software.
p130
aVBecause in fact, this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet
p131
aVfor many years and developed this.
p132
aVAnd my youngest son, who studied Chinese in Beijing.
p133
aVSo they come in with the two perspectives I have, you know?
p134
aVAnd my son, youngest son who studied in Beijing,
p135
aVin China, he got a long-term perspective.
p136
aVWhereas when my oldest son, who works for Google,
p137
aVhe should develop by quarter, or by half-year.
p138
aVOr Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut in China they look generation after generation
p141
aVbecause they remember
p142
aVthe very embarrassing period, for 100 years,
p143
aVwhen they went backwards.
p144
aVAnd then they would remember the first part
p145
aVof last century, which was really bad,
p146
aVand we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward.
p147
aVBut this was 1963.
p148
aVMao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China,
p149
aVand then he died, and then Deng Xiaoping started
p150
aVthis amazing move forward.
p151
aa(lp152
VIsn't it strange to see that the United States
p153
aVfirst grew the economy, and then gradually got rich?
p154
aVWhereas China could get healthy much earlier,
p155
aVbecause they applied the knowledge of education, nutrition,
p156
aVand then also benefits of penicillin
p157
aVand vaccines and family planning.
p158
aVAnd Asia could have social development
p159
aVbefore they got the economic development.
p160
aVSo to me, as a public health professor,
p161
aVit's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now.
p162
aa(lp163
VBecause what you see here, what you see here
p164
aVis the flat world of Thomas Friedman,
p165
aVisn't it.
p166
aVIt's not really, really flat.
p167
aVBut the middle income countries \u2014
p168
aVand this is where I suggest to my students,
p169
aVstop using the concept "developing world."
p170
aVBecause after all, talking about the developing world
p171
aVis like having two chapters in the history of the United States.
p172
aa(lp173
VThe last chapter is about present, and president Obama,
p174
aVand the other is about the past,
p175
aVwhere you cover everything from Washington
p176
aVto Eisenhower.
p177
aVBecause Washington to Eisenhower,
p178
aVthat is what we find in the developing world.
p179
aVWe could actually go to Mayflower
p180
aVto Eisenhower,
p181
aVand that would be put together into a developing world,
p182
aVwhich is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way,
p183
aVwhich have great entrepreneurs,
p184
aVbut also have the collapsing countries.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo, how could we make better sense about this?
p187
aVWell, one way of trying is to see whether we could
p188
aVlook at income distribution.
p189
aVThis is the income distribution of peoples in the world,
p190
aVfrom $1. This is where you have food to eat.
p191
aVThese people go to bed hungry.
p192
aVAnd this is the number of people.
p193
aVThis is $10, whether you have a public or a private
p194
aVhealth service system. This is where you can
p195
aVprovide health service for your family and school for your children,
p196
aVand this is OECD countries:
p197
aVGreen, Latin America, East Europe.
p198
aVThis is East Asia, and the light blue there is South Asia.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd this is how the world changed.
p201
aVIt changed like this.
p202
aVCan you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions
p203
aVand billions is coming out of poverty in Asia?
p204
aVAnd it goes over here?
p205
aVAnd I come now, into projections,
p206
aVbut I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because \u2014
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aVthat's where the projections are not valid any longer.
p209
aVProbably the world will do this.
p210
aVand then it will continue forward like this.
p211
aVBut more or less, this is what will happen,
p212
aVand we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided.
p213
aa(lp214
VWe have the high income countries here,
p215
aVwith the United States as a leading power;
p216
aVwe have the emerging economies in the middle,
p217
aVwhich provide a lot of the funding for the bailout;
p218
aVand we have the low income countries here.
p219
aVYeah, this is a fact that from where the money comes,
p220
aVthey have been saving, you know, over the last decade.
p221
aVAnd here we have the low income countries
p222
aVwhere entrepreneurs are.
p223
aVAnd here we have the countries in collapse and war,
p224
aVlike Afghanistan, Somalia, parts of Congo, Darfur.
p225
aVWe have all this at the same time.
p226
aa(lp227
VThat's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened
p228
aVin the developing world.
p229
aVBecause it's so different, what has happened there.
p230
aVAnd that's why I suggest
p231
aVa slightly different approach of what you would call it.
p232
aVAnd you have huge differences within countries also.
p233
aVI heard that your departments here were by regions.
p234
aVHere you have Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,
p235
aVEast Asia, Arab states,
p236
aVEast Europe, Latin America, and OECD.
p237
aVAnd on this axis, GDP.
p238
aVAnd on this, heath, child survival,
p239
aVand it doesn't come as a surprise
p240
aVthat Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom.
p241
aa(lp242
VBut when I split it, when I split it
p243
aVinto country bubbles,
p244
aVthe size of the bubbles here is the population.
p245
aVThen you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different.
p246
aVThere is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa.
p247
aVAnd I can split the others. Here is the South Asian,
p248
aVArab world.
p249
aVNow all your different departments.
p250
aVEast Europe, Latin America, and OECD countries.
p251
aVAnd here were are. We have a continuum in the world.
p252
aVWe cannot put it into two parts.
p253
aa(lp254
VIt is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here,
p255
aVbuilding, building countries.
p256
aVIt's Lincoln here, advancing them.
p257
aVIt's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries.
p258
aVAnd then it's United States today, up here.
p259
aVAnd we have countries all this way.
p260
aVNow, this is the important thing
p261
aVof understanding how the world has changed.
p262
aVAt this point I decided to make a pause.
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd it is my task, on behalf of the rest of the world,
p266
aVto convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers,
p267
aVfor Demographic Health Survey.
p268
aVMany are not aware of \u2014 no, this is not a joke.
p269
aVThis is very serious.
p270
aVIt is due to USA's continuous sponsoring
p271
aVduring 25 years of the very good methodology
p272
aVfor measuring child mortality
p273
aVthat we have a grasp of what's happening in the world.
p274
aV(Applause)
p275
aVAnd it is U.S. government at its best,
p276
aVwithout advocacy, providing facts,
p277
aVthat it's useful for the society.
p278
aVAnd providing data free of charge
p279
aVon the internet, for the world to use. Thank you very much.
p280
aa(lp281
VQuite the opposite of the World Bank,
p282
aVwho compiled data with government money,
p283
aVtax money, and then they sell it to add a little profit,
p284
aVin a very inefficient, Gutenberg way.
p285
aV(Applause)
p286
aVBut the people doing that at the World Bank
p287
aVare among the best in the world.
p288
aVAnd they are highly skilled professionals.
p289
aVIt's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies
p290
aVto deal with the world in the modern way, as we do.
p291
aVAnd when it comes to free data and transparency,
p292
aVUnited States of America is one of the best.
p293
aVAnd that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor.
p294
aV(Laughter)
p295
aVAnd I'm not paid to come here, no.
p296
aa(lp297
VI would like to show you what happens with the data,
p298
aVwhat we can show with this data.
p299
aVLook here. This is the world.
p300
aVWith income down there and child mortality.
p301
aVAnd what has happened in the world?
p302
aVSince 1950, during the last 50 years
p303
aVwe have had a fall in child mortality.
p304
aVAnd it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this.
p305
aVAnd we had an increase in income.
p306
aVAnd the blue former developing countries
p307
aVare mixing up with the former industrialized western world.
p308
aVWe have a continuum. But we still have, of course,
p309
aVCongo, up there. We still have as poor countries
p310
aVas we have had, always, in history.
p311
aVAnd that's the bottom billion, where we've heard today
p312
aVabout a completely new approach to do it.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd how fast has this happened?
p315
aVWell, MDG 4.
p316
aVThe United States has not been so eager
p317
aVto use MDG 4.
p318
aVBut you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it,
p319
aVbecause it's the only child mortality that we can measure.
p320
aVAnd we used to say that it should fall four percent per year.
p321
aVLet's see what Sweden has done.
p322
aVWe used to boast about fast social progress.
p323
aVThat's where we were, 1900.
p324
aV1900, Sweden was there.
p325
aVSame child mortality as Bangladesh had, 1990,
p326
aVthough they had lower income.
p327
aVThey started very well. They used the aid well.
p328
aVThey vaccinated the kids. They get better water.
p329
aVAnd they reduced child mortality,
p330
aVwith an amazing 4.7 percent per year. They beat Sweden.
p331
aVI run Sweden the same 16 year period.
p332
aa(lp333
VSecond round, it's Sweden, 1916,
p334
aVagainst Egypt, 1990.
p335
aVHere we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here.
p336
aVThey get safe water, they get food for the poor,
p337
aVand they get malaria eradicated.
p338
aV5.5 percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd third chance for Sweden, against Brazil here.
p341
aVBrazil here has amazing social improvement
p342
aVover the last 16 years,
p343
aVand they go faster than Sweden.
p344
aVThis means that the world is converging.
p345
aVThe middle income countries,
p346
aVthe emerging economy, they are catching up.
p347
aVThey are moving to cities,
p348
aVwhere they also get better assistance for that.
p349
aa(lp350
VWell the Swedish students protest at this point.
p351
aVThey say, "This is not fair,
p352
aVbecause these countries had vaccines and antibiotics
p353
aVthat were not available for Sweden.
p354
aVWe have to do real-time competition."
p355
aVOkay. I give you Singapore, the year I was born.
p356
aVSingapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden.
p357
aVIt's the most tropical country in the world,
p358
aVa marshland on the equator.
p359
aVAnd here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent.
p360
aVBut then they started to grow their economy.
p361
aVAnd they made the social investment. They got away malaria.
p362
aVThey got a magnificent health system
p363
aVthat beat both the U.S. and Sweden.
p364
aVWe never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden!
p365
aV(Applause)
p366
aa(lp367
VAll these green countries are achieving millennium development goals.
p368
aVThese yellow are just about to be doing this.
p369
aVThese red are the countries that doesn't do it, and the policy has to be improved.
p370
aVNot simplistic extrapolation.
p371
aVWe have to really find a way
p372
aVof supporting those countries in a better way.
p373
aVWe have to respect the middle income countries
p374
aVon what they are doing.
p375
aVAnd we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world.
p376
aa(lp377
VThis is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries.
p378
aVThe blue is Africa.
p379
aVThe size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected.
p380
aVYou see the tragedy in South Africa there.
p381
aVAbout 20 percent of the adult population are infected.
p382
aVAnd in spite of them having quite a high income,
p383
aVthey have a huge number of HIV infected.
p384
aVBut you also see that there are African countries down here.
p385
aVThere is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa.
p386
aVThere's a number, five to 10 countries in Africa
p387
aVthat has the same level as Sweden and United States.
p388
aVAnd there are others who are extremely high.
p389
aa(lp390
VAnd I will show you that what has happened
p391
aVin one of the best countries, with the most vibrant economy
p392
aVin Africa and a good governance, Botswana.
p393
aVThey have a very high level. It's coming down.
p394
aVBut now it's not falling,
p395
aVbecause there, with help from PEPFAR,
p396
aVit's working with treatment. And people are not dying.
p397
aVAnd you can see it's not that easy,
p398
aVthat it is war which caused this.
p399
aVBecause here, in Congo, there is war.
p400
aVAnd here, in Zambia, there is peace.
p401
aa(lp402
VAnd it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher.
p403
aVIf I split Tanzania in its income,
p404
aVthe richer 20 percent in Tanzania
p405
aVhas more HIV than the poorest one.
p406
aVAnd it's really different within each country.
p407
aVLook at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different.
p408
aVAnd this is the situation you see.
p409
aVIt's not deep poverty. It's the special situation,
p410
aVprobably of concurrent sexual partnership
p411
aVamong part of the heterosexual population
p412
aVin some countries, or some parts of countries,
p413
aVin south and eastern Africa.
p414
aa(lp415
VDon't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue.
p416
aVMake it a local issue. And do prevention at each place,
p417
aVin the way it can be done there.
p418
aVSo to just end up,
p419
aVthere are things of suffering
p420
aVin the one billion poorest, which we don't know.
p421
aVThose who live beyond the cellphone,
p422
aVthose who have yet to see a computer,
p423
aVthose who have no electricity at home.
p424
aa(lp425
VThis is the disease, Konzo, I spent 20 years
p426
aVelucidating in Africa.
p427
aVIt's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation.
p428
aVIt's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '30s.
p429
aVIt's similar to other nutritional diseases.
p430
aVIt will never affect a rich person.
p431
aa(lp432
VWe have seen it here in Mozambique.
p433
aVThis is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania.
p434
aVYou never heard about the disease.
p435
aVBut it's much more than Ebola
p436
aVthat has been affected by this disease.
p437
aVCause crippling throughout the world.
p438
aVAnd over the last two years,
p439
aV2,000 people has been crippled
p440
aVin the southern tip of Bandundu region.
p441
aVThat used to be the illegal diamond trade,
p442
aVfrom the UNITA-dominated area in Angola.
p443
aVThat has now disappeared,
p444
aVand they are now in great economic problem.
p445
aVAnd one week ago, for the first time,
p446
aVthere were four lines on the Internet.
p447
aa(lp448
VDon't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies
p449
aVand the great capacity
p450

VThe magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.
p5
aVWhich is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.
p6
aVThey are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.
p7
aVAnd I go on the podium.
p8
aVYou know, this little office of the conductor.
p9
aVOr rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,
p10
aVwith a lot of space.
p11
aVAnd in front of all that noise,
p12
aVyou do a very small gesture.
p13
aVSomething like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.
p14
aVAnd suddenly, out of the chaos, order.
p15
aVNoise becomes music.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd this is fantastic. And it's so tempting
p18
aVto think that it's all about me.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVAll those great people here, virtuosos,
p21
aVthey make noise, they need me to do that.
p22
aVNot really. If it were that,
p23
aVI would just save you the talk,
p24
aVand teach you the gesture.
p25
aVSo you could go out to the world
p26
aVand do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,
p27
aVand you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.
p28
aVLet's look at the first video.
p29
aVI hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.
p30
aVAnd then speak a little bit about how it comes about.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Music)
p33
aa(lp34
VWas that nice?
p35
aVSo that was a sort of a success.
p36
aVNow, who should we thank for the success?
p37
aVI mean, obviously the orchestra musicians
p38
aVplaying beautifully,
p39
aVthe Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.
p40
aVThey don't often even look at the conductor.
p41
aVThen you have the clapping audience, yeah,
p42
aVactually taking part in doing the music.
p43
aVYou know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.
p44
aVThis is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast
p45
aVthat you will ever get in Vienna.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VUnlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.
p49
aVYou know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say
p50
aVthat, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.
p51
aVIn Tel Aviv they come to my concerts."
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVSo that's a sort of a tradition.
p54
aVBut Viennese audiences do not do that.
p55
aVHere they go out of their regular, just to be part of that,
p56
aVto become part of the orchestra, and that's great.
p57
aVYou know, audiences like you, yeah,
p58
aVmake the event.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut what about the conductor? What can you say
p61
aVthe conductor was doing, actually?
p62
aVUm, he was happy.
p63
aVAnd I often show this to senior management.
p64
aVPeople get annoyed.
p65
aV"You come to work. How come you're so happy?"
p66
aVSomething must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.
p67
aVAnd I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness
p68
aVdoes not come from
p69
aVonly his own story and his joy of the music.
p70
aVThe joy is about enabling other people's stories
p71
aVto be heard at the same time.
p72
aa(lp73
VYou have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.
p74
aVYou have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.
p75
aVYou have the stories of the individuals
p76
aVin the orchestra and in the audience.
p77
aVAnd then you have other stories, unseen.
p78
aVPeople who build this wonderful concert hall.
p79
aVPeople who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.
p80
aVAnd all those stories are being heard at the same time.
p81
aVThis is the true experience of a live concert.
p82
aVThat's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?
p83
aVAnd not all conductors do just that.
p84
aVLet's see somebody else, a great conductor.
p85
aVRiccardo Muti, please.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Music)
p88
aa(lp89
VYeah, that was very short, but you could see
p90
aVit's a completely different figure. Right?
p91
aVHe's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?
p92
aVSo clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.
p93
aVCan we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?
p94
aVCan you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?
p95
aVYou have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.
p96
aVOkay? Ready?
p97
aa(lp98
VAudience: \u266b Aaaaaaah ... \u266b
p99
aa(lp100
VItay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without me
p101
aVI feel even more redundant than I already feel.
p102
aVSo please, wait for the conductor.
p103
aVNow look at me. "Aaaaaah," and I stop you. Let's go.
p104
aa(lp105
VAudience: \u266b ... Aaaaaaaah ... \u266b
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VItay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aVBut ... There is a vacancy for a ...
p111
aVBut \u2014 (Laughter)
p112
aV\u2014 you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.
p113
aVNow what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ...
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aVAnd then \u2014 sort of \u2014 (Laughter)
p116
aVSo not only the instruction is clear,
p117
aVbut also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVSo, does it work? Yes, it works \u2014
p120
aVto a certain point.
p121
aa(lp122
VWhen Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?"
p123
aVHe says, "I'm responsible."
p124
aVResponsible in front of him.
p125
aVNo he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart,
p126
aVwhich is \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 like a third seat from the center.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVSo he says, "If I'm \u2014
p129
aV(Applause)
p130
aVif I'm responsible for Mozart,
p131
aVthis is going to be the only story to be told.
p132
aVIt's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it."
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd you know what happened to Muti?
p135
aVThree years ago he got a letter signed by
p136
aVall 700 employees of La Scala,
p137
aVmusical employees, I mean the musicians,
p138
aVsaying, "You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign."
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aV"Why? Because you don't let us develop.
p141
aVYou're using us as instruments, not as partners.
p142
aVAnd our joy of music, etc., etc. ..."
p143
aVSo he had to resign. Isn't that nice?
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVHe's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.
p146
aVWell, can you do it with less control,
p147
aVor with a different kind of control?
p148
aVLet's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Music)
p151
aa(lp152
VI'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.
p153
aVIt's not true. When he was a young man
p154
aVof about 30, he wrote what he called
p155
aV"The Ten Commandments for Conductors."
p156
aVThe first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert
p157
aVit means that you must have done something wrong.
p158
aVThat's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.
p159
aVIt says: Never look at the trombones \u2014
p160
aVit only encourages them.
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VSo, the whole idea is really to let
p164
aVit happen by itself.
p165
aVDo not interfere.
p166
aVBut how does it happen? Did you see
p167
aVhim turning pages in the score?
p168
aVNow, either he is senile,
p169
aVand doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.
p170
aVOr he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying,
p171
aV"Come on guys. You have to play by the book.
p172
aVSo it's not about my story. It's not about your story.
p173
aVIt's only the execution of the written music,
p174
aVno interpretation."
p175
aVInterpretation is the real story of the performer.
p176
aVSo, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control.
p177
aVLet's see another super-conductor,
p178
aVa German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Music)
p181
aa(lp182
VWhat's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed.
p183
aVDid you see the hands?
p184
aVDid you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice.
p185
aVOnce like a Muti, and you'll \u2014 (Claps) \u2014 clap, just once.
p186
aVAnd then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay?
p187
aVLike Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...
p188
aV(Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.
p189
aa(lp190
VAudience: (Claps)
p191
aa(lp192
VItay Talgam: Hmm ... again.
p193
aa(lp194
VAudience: (Claps)
p195
aVItay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained,
p196
aVlet me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.
p197
aa(lp198
VAudience: (Claps) (Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VItay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter)
p201
aVBecause you didn't know when to play.
p202
aVNow I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic
p203
aVdoesn't know when to play.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVBut I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.
p206
aVThis is a German orchestra, yes?
p207
aVThey look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aV"Do you understand what this guy wants?"
p210
aVAnd after doing that,
p211
aVthey really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra
p212
aVlead the whole ensemble in playing together.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd when Karajan is asked about it
p215
aVhe actually says, "Yes, the worst damage
p216
aVI can do to my orchestra
p217
aVis to give them a clear instruction.
p218
aVBecause that would
p219
aVprevent the ensemble, the listening to each other
p220
aVthat is needed for an orchestra."
p221
aVNow that's great. What about the eyes?
p222
aVWhy are the eyes closed?
p223
aVThere is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.
p224
aVAnd he cues in a flute player like this.
p225
aVThe guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter)
p226
aV"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"
p227
aVWhat do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start?
p228
aVOh yeah. He says, "You start when you can't stand it anymore."
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VMeaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.
p232
aVIt's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head.
p233
aVAnd you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure
p234
aVbecause I don't give you instruction,
p235
aVand yet, you have to guess my mind.
p236
aVSo it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet
p237
aVvery firm control.
p238
aVCan we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back
p239
aVto the first conductor we've seen:
p240
aVCarlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Music)
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter) Yeah.
p245
aVWell, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way?
p246
aVNo, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.
p247
aVWhen he does this, it's not,
p248
aV"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix,
p249
aVsmash it on the floor." It's not that.
p250
aVHe says, "This is the gesture of the music.
p251
aVI'm opening a space for you
p252
aVto put in another layer
p253
aVof interpretation."
p254
aVThat is another story.
p255
aa(lp256
VBut how does it really work together
p257
aVif it doesn't give them instructions?
p258
aVIt's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?
p259
aVYou're not really given any instructions,
p260
aVbut the forces of the process itself keep you in place.
p261
aVThat's what he does.
p262
aVThe interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.
p263
aVIt's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd that's what makes them into partners.
p266
aVYou have the plan in your head.
p267
aVYou know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.
p268
aVBut here and there and that. You know what to do.
p269
aVAnd you become a partner building the rollercoaster,
p270
aVyeah, with sound,
p271
aVas you actually take the ride.
p272
aVThis is very exciting for those players.
p273
aVThey do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVIt is very tiring. Yeah?
p276
aVBut it's the best music making, like this.
p277
aa(lp278
VBut of course it's not only about motivation
p279
aVand giving them a lot of physical energy.
p280
aVYou also have to be very professional.
p281
aVAnd look again at this Kleiber.
p282
aVCan we have the next video, quickly?
p283
aVYou'll see what happens when there is a mistake.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.
p286
aV(Music)
p287
aVAnd now there is a trumpet player who
p288
aVdoes something not exactly the way it should be done.
p289
aVGo along with the video. Look.
p290
aVSee, second time for the same player.
p291
aV(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.
p292
aV(Laughter)
p293
aV"Wait for me after the concert.
p294
aVI have a short notice to give you."
p295
aVYou know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.
p296
aVBut authority is not enough to make people your partners.
p297
aa(lp298
VLet's see the next video, please. See what happens here.
p299
aVYou might be surprised having seen Kleiber
p300
aVas such a hyperactive guy.
p301
aVHe's conducting Mozart.
p302
aV(Music)
p303
aVThe whole orchestra is playing.
p304
aV(Music)
p305
aVNow something else.
p306
aV(Music)
p307
aVSee? He is there 100 percent,
p308
aVbut not commanding, not telling what to do.
p309
aVRather enjoying what the soloist is doing.
p310
aV(Music)
p311
aa(lp312
VAnother solo now. See what you can pick up from this.
p313
aV(Music)
p314
aVLook at the eyes.
p315
aVOkay. You see that?
p316
aVFirst of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.
p317
aVIt's not feedback. It's an "Mmmm ..." Yeah, it comes from here.
p318
aVSo that's a good thing.
p319
aVAnd the second thing is
p320
aVit's about actually being in control,
p321
aVbut in a very special way.
p322
aVWhen Kleiber does \u2014 did you see the eyes,
p323
aVgoing from here? (Singing)
p324
aVYou know what happens? Gravitation is no more.
p325
aa(lp326
VKleiber not only creates a process,
p327
aVbut also creates the conditions in the world
p328
aVin which this process takes place.
p329
aVSo again, the oboe player
p330
aVis completely autonomous
p331
aVand therefore happy and proud of his work,
p332
aVand creative and all of that.
p333
aVAnd the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.
p334
aVSo control is no longer a zero-sum game.
p335
aVYou have this control. You have this control. And all you put together,
p336
aVin partnership, brings about the best music.
p337
aVSo Kleiber is about process.
p338
aVKleiber is about conditions in the world.
p339
aa(lp340
VBut you need to have process and content to create the meaning.
p341
aVLenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.
p342
aVSince he was a great teacher,
p343
aVLenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Music)
p346
aa(lp347
VDo you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?
p348
aVWell he had a wonderful expression, but only one.
p349
aV(Laughter)
p350
aVDid you see Lenny's face?
p351
aVYou know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain.
p352
aVAnd you're playing a painful sound.
p353
aVAnd you look at Lenny and he's suffering.
p354
aVBut not in a way that you want to stop.
p355
aVIt's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.
p356
aV(Laughter)
p357
aVBut you can see the music on his face.
p358
aVYou can see the baton left his hand. No more baton.
p359
aVNow it's about you, the player,
p360
aVtelling the story.
p361
aVNow it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story.
p362
aVAnd even briefly, you become the storyteller
p363
aVto which the community, the whole community, listens to.
p364
aVAnd Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?
p365
aa(lp366
VNow, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together,
p367
aVand maybe some others,
p368
aVyou can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.
p369
aVAnd for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.
p370
aVMy friend Peter says,
p371
aV"If you love something, give it away." So, please.

He was the first Israeli conductor to perform with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and the Leipzig Opera house.

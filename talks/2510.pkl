VWe have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient Greeks dressed,
p5
aVhow they lived,
p6
aVhow they fought ...
p7
aVbut how did they think?
p8
aa(lp9
VOne natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought \u2014
p10
aVour ability to imagine,
p11
aVto be conscious,
p12
aVto dream \u2014
p13
aVhave always been the same.
p14
aVAnother possibility
p15
aVis that the social transformations that have shaped our culture
p16
aVmay have also changed the structural columns of human thought.
p17
aa(lp18
VWe may all have different opinions about this.
p19
aVActually, it's a long-standing philosophical debate.
p20
aVBut is this question even amenable to science?
p21
aa(lp22
VHere I'd like to propose
p23
aVthat in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient Greek cities looked
p24
aVjust based on a few bricks,
p25
aVthat the writings of a culture are the archaeological records,
p26
aVthe fossils, of human thought.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd in fact,
p29
aVdoing some form of psychological analysis
p30
aVof some of the most ancient books of human culture,
p31
aVJulian Jaynes came up in the '70s with a very wild and radical hypothesis:
p32
aVthat only 3,000 years ago,
p33
aVhumans were what today we would call schizophrenics.
p34
aVAnd he made this claim
p35
aVbased on the fact that the first humans described in these books
p36
aVbehaved consistently,
p37
aVin different traditions and in different places of the world,
p38
aVas if they were hearing and obeying voices
p39
aVthat they perceived as coming from the Gods,
p40
aVor from the muses ...
p41
aVwhat today we would call hallucinations.
p42
aVAnd only then, as time went on,
p43
aVthey began to recognize that they were the creators,
p44
aVthe owners of these inner voices.
p45
aVAnd with this, they gained introspection:
p46
aVthe ability to think about their own thoughts.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo Jaynes's theory is that consciousness,
p49
aVat least in the way we perceive it today,
p50
aVwhere we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence \u2014
p51
aVis a quite recent cultural development.
p52
aVAnd this theory is quite spectacular,
p53
aVbut it has an obvious problem
p54
aVwhich is that it's built on just a few and very specific examples.
p55
aVSo the question is whether the theory
p56
aVthat introspection built up in human history only about 3,000 years ago
p57
aVcan be examined in a quantitative and objective manner.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious.
p60
aVIt's not like Plato woke up one day and then he wrote,
p61
aV"Hello, I'm Plato,
p62
aVand as of today, I have a fully introspective consciousness."
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem.
p67
aVWe need to find the emergence of a concept that's never said.
p68
aVThe word introspection does not appear a single time
p69
aVin the books we want to analyze.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo our way to solve this is to build the space of words.
p72
aVThis is a huge space that contains all words
p73
aVin such a way that the distance between any two of them
p74
aVis indicative of how closely related they are.
p75
aVSo for instance,
p76
aVyou want the words "dog" and "cat" to be very close together,
p77
aVbut the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm" to be very far away.
p78
aVAnd this has to be true for any two words within the space.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd there are different ways that we can construct the space of words.
p81
aVOne is just asking the experts,
p82
aVa bit like we do with dictionaries.
p83
aVAnother possibility
p84
aVis following the simple assumption that when two words are related,
p85
aVthey tend to appear in the same sentences,
p86
aVin the same paragraphs,
p87
aVin the same documents,
p88
aVmore often than would be expected just by pure chance.
p89
aVAnd this simple hypothesis,
p90
aVthis simple method,
p91
aVwith some computational tricks
p92
aVthat have to do with the fact
p93
aVthat this is a very complex and high-dimensional space,
p94
aVturns out to be quite effective.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd just to give you a flavor of how well this works,
p97
aVthis is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words.
p98
aVAnd you can see first
p99
aVthat words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods.
p100
aVSo you get the fruits, the body parts,
p101
aVthe computer parts, the scientific terms and so on.
p102
aa(lp103
VThe algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy.
p104
aVSo for instance,
p105
aVyou can see that the scientific terms break down into two subcategories
p106
aVof the astronomic and the physics terms.
p107
aVAnd then there are very fine things.
p108
aVFor instance, the word astronomy,
p109
aVwhich seems a bit bizarre where it is,
p110
aVis actually exactly where it should be,
p111
aVbetween what it is,
p112
aVan actual science,
p113
aVand between what it describes,
p114
aVthe astronomical terms.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd we could go on and on with this.
p117
aVActually, if you stare at this for a while,
p118
aVand you just build random trajectories,
p119
aVyou will see that it actually feels a bit like doing poetry.
p120
aVAnd this is because, in a way,
p121
aVwalking in this space is like walking in the mind.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd the last thing
p124
aVis that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions,
p125
aVof which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection.
p126
aVSo for instance,
p127
aVwords such as "self," "guilt," "reason," "emotion,"
p128
aVare very close to "introspection,"
p129
aVbut other words,
p130
aVsuch as "red," "football," "candle," "banana,"
p131
aVare just very far away.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd so once we've built the space,
p134
aVthe question of the history of introspection,
p135
aVor of the history of any concept
p136
aVwhich before could seem abstract and somehow vague,
p137
aVbecomes concrete \u2014
p138
aVbecomes amenable to quantitative science.
p139
aa(lp140
VAll that we have to do is take the books,
p141
aVwe digitize them,
p142
aVand we take this stream of words as a trajectory
p143
aVand project them into the space,
p144
aVand then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time
p145
aVcircling closely to the concept of introspection.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd with this,
p148
aVwe could analyze the history of introspection
p149
aVin the ancient Greek tradition,
p150
aVfor which we have the best available written record.
p151
aVSo what we did is we took all the books \u2014
p152
aVwe just ordered them by time \u2014
p153
aVfor each book we take the words
p154
aVand we project them to the space,
p155
aVand then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection,
p156
aVand we just average that.
p157
aVAnd then we ask whether, as time goes on and on,
p158
aVthese books get closer, and closer and closer
p159
aVto the concept of introspection.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd this is exactly what happens in the ancient Greek tradition.
p162
aVSo you can see that for the oldest books in the Homeric tradition,
p163
aVthere is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection.
p164
aVBut about four centuries before Christ,
p165
aVthis starts ramping up very rapidly to an almost five-fold increase
p166
aVof books getting closer, and closer and closer
p167
aVto the concept of introspection.
p168
aVAnd one of the nice things about this
p169
aVis that now we can ask
p170
aVwhether this is also true in a different, independent tradition.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo we just ran this same analysis on the Judeo-Christian tradition,
p173
aVand we got virtually the same pattern.
p174
aVAgain, you see a small increase for the oldest books in the Old Testament,
p175
aVand then it increases much more rapidly
p176
aVin the new books of the New Testament.
p177
aVAnd then we get the peak of introspection
p178
aVin "The Confessions of Saint Augustine,"
p179
aVabout four centuries after Christ.
p180
aVAnd this was very important,
p181
aVbecause Saint Augustine had been recognized by scholars,
p182
aVphilologists, historians,
p183
aVas one of the founders of introspection.
p184
aVActually, some believe him to be the father of modern psychology.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo our algorithm,
p187
aVwhich has the virtue of being quantitative,
p188
aVof being objective,
p189
aVand of course of being extremely fast \u2014
p190
aVit just runs in a fraction of a second \u2014
p191
aVcan capture some of the most important conclusions
p192
aVof this long tradition of investigation.
p193
aVAnd this is in a way one of the beauties of science,
p194
aVwhich is that now this idea can be translated
p195
aVand generalized to a whole lot of different domains.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness,
p198
aVmaybe the most challenging question we can pose to ourselves
p199
aVis whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness.
p200
aVTo put it more precisely,
p201
aVwhether the words we say today
p202
aVcan tell us something of where our minds will be in a few days,
p203
aVin a few months
p204
aVor a few years from now.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors
p207
aVthat detect our heart rate,
p208
aVour respiration,
p209
aVour genes,
p210
aVon the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases,
p211
aVwe can ask whether monitoring and analyzing the words we speak,
p212
aVwe tweet, we email, we write,
p213
aVcan tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong with our minds.
p214
aVAnd with Guillermo Cecchi,
p215
aVwho has been my brother in this adventure,
p216
aVwe took on this task.
p217
aVAnd we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people
p218
aVwho were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd so what we did is, we measured speech at day one,
p221
aVand then we asked whether the properties of the speech could predict,
p222
aVwithin a window of almost three years,
p223
aVthe future development of psychosis.
p224
aVBut despite our hopes,
p225
aVwe got failure after failure.
p226
aVThere was just not enough information in semantics
p227
aVto predict the future organization of the mind.
p228
aVIt was good enough
p229
aVto distinguish between a group of schizophrenics and a control group,
p230
aVa bit like we had done for the ancient texts,
p231
aVbut not to predict the future onset of psychosis.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut then we realized
p234
aVthat maybe the most important thing was not so much what they were saying,
p235
aVbut how they were saying it.
p236
aVMore specifically,
p237
aVit was not in which semantic neighborhoods the words were,
p238
aVbut how far and fast they jumped
p239
aVfrom one semantic neighborhood to the other one.
p240
aVAnd so we came up with this measure,
p241
aVwhich we termed semantic coherence,
p242
aVwhich essentially measures the persistence of speech within one semantic topic,
p243
aVwithin one semantic category.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd it turned out to be that for this group of 34 people,
p246
aVthe algorithm based on semantic coherence could predict,
p247
aVwith 100 percent accuracy,
p248
aVwho developed psychosis and who will not.
p249
aVAnd this was something that could not be achieved \u2014
p250
aVnot even close \u2014
p251
aVwith all the other existing clinical measures.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd I remember vividly, while I was working on this,
p254
aVI was sitting at my computer
p255
aVand I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo \u2014
p256
aVPolo had been my first student back in Buenos Aires,
p257
aVand at the time he was living in New York.
p258
aVAnd there was something in this tweets \u2014
p259
aVI could not tell exactly what because nothing was said explicitly \u2014
p260
aVbut I got this strong hunch,
p261
aVthis strong intuition, that something was going wrong.
p262
aVSo I picked up the phone, and I called Polo,
p263
aVand in fact he was not feeling well.
p264
aVAnd this simple fact,
p265
aVthat reading in between the lines,
p266
aVI could sense, through words, his feelings,
p267
aVwas a simple, but very effective way to help.
p268
aa(lp269
VWhat I tell you today
p270
aVis that we're getting close to understanding
p271
aVhow we can convert this intuition that we all have,
p272
aVthat we all share,
p273
aVinto an algorithm.
p274
aVAnd in doing so,
p275
aVwe may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health,
p276
aVbased on objective, quantitative and automated analysis
p277
aVof the words we write,
p278
aVof the words we say.
p279
aa(lp280
VGracias.

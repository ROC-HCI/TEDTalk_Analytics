VSo, I kind of believe that we're in like the "cave-painting" era of computer interfaces.
p5
aVLike, they're very kind of \u2014 they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be
p6
aVand I'd like to change all that.
p7
aVHit me.
p8
aVOK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right?
p9
aVIt's very flat, kind of rigid.
p10
aVAnd OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac,
p11
aVyou know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last,
p12
aVyou know, 30 years.
p13
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p14
aVLike I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers.
p15
aVI mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk.
p18
aVIt's so much more subtle, so much more visceral
p19
aV\u2014 you know, what's visible, what's not.
p20
aVAnd I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop.
p21
aVSo I kind of have a \u2014 this is BumpTop.
p22
aVIt's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing.
p23
aVSo you can bump things \u2014 they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff.
p24
aVAnd instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull,
p25
aVthings collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk,
p26
aVI can \u2014 let me just grab these guys \u2014 I can turn things into piles
p27
aVinstead of just the folders that we have.
p28
aVAnd once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid,
p29
aVor you know, flip through them like a book
p30
aVor I can lay them out like a deck of cards.
p31
aVWhen they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things
p32
aVor just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right?
p33
aVAnd then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.
p34
aa(lp35
VAlso, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that?
p36
aVI just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way.
p37
aVAlso some of the stuff we can do is,
p38
aVfor these individual icons we thought \u2014 I mean,
p39
aVhow can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further?
p40
aVAnd one of the things I can do is make it bigger
p41
aVif I want to emphasize it and make it more important.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this,
p44
aVit's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move
p45
aVbut if I throw it at the lighter guys, right?
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVSo it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right?
p48
aVThis is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool.
p49
aa(lp50
VDespite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared,
p51
aVbecause it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties.
p52
aVAnd some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system.
p53
aVSo one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them,
p54
aVjust like paper. Remember, you know, something for later.
p55
aVOr if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up
p56
aVand, you know, toss it to the corner.
p57
aVAlso just like paper, around our workspace
p58
aVwe'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later,
p59
aVand I can do the same thing here,
p60
aVand you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices.
p61
aVAnd I can pull them off when I want to work with them.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that,
p64
aVyou know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer."
p65
aVSo one thing we have for that is like a grid align,
p66
aVkind of \u2014 so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned.
p67
aVMore boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping.
p68
aVAnd you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop.
p69
aa(lp70
VLet's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke.
p71
aVI think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software \u2014
p72
aVI think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop \u2014 but browsing photographs.
p73
aVI think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs
p74
aVand bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing.
p75
aVI can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable \u2014
p76
aVand you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it.
p77
aVAnd I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before.
p78
aVSo I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know \u2014
p79
aVokay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here,
p80
aVand I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd that's BumpTop. Thanks!

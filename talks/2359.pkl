VI would like to invite you
p5
aVto come along on a visit
p6
aVto a dark continent.
p7
aVIt is the continent hidden
p8
aVunder the surface of the earth.
p9
aVIt is largely unexplored,
p10
aVpoorly understood, and the stuff of legends.
p11
aVBut it is made also of dramatic landscapes
p12
aVlike this huge underground chamber,
p13
aVand it is rich with surprising biological and mineralogical worlds.
p14
aa(lp15
VThanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers in the last three centuries \u2014
p16
aVactually, we know also thanks to satellite technology, of course \u2014
p17
aVwe know almost every single square meter of our planet's surface.
p18
aVHowever, we know still very little about what is hidden inside the earth.
p19
aVBecause a cave landscape, like this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden,
p20
aVthe potential of cave exploration \u2014 the geographical dimension \u2014
p21
aVis poorly understood and unappreciated.
p22
aVBecause we are creatures living on the surface,
p23
aVour perception of the inner side of the planet
p24
aVis in some ways skewed,
p25
aVas is that of the depth of the oceans
p26
aVor of the upper atmosphere.
p27
aa(lp28
VHowever, since systematic cave exploration started about one century ago,
p29
aVwe know actually that caves exist in every continent of the world.
p30
aVA single cave system, like Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky,
p31
aVcan be as long as more than 600 kilometers.
p32
aVAnd an abyss like Krubera Voronya, which is in the Caucasus region,
p33
aVactually the deepest cave explored in the world,
p34
aVcan go as far as more than 2,000 meters below the surface.
p35
aVThat means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer.
p36
aa(lp37
VCaves form in karstic regions.
p38
aVSo karstic regions are areas of the world
p39
aVwhere the infiltrating water along cracks, fractures,
p40
aVcan easily dissolve soluble lithologies,
p41
aVforming a drainage system of tunnels, conduits \u2014
p42
aVa three-dimensional network, actually.
p43
aVKarstic regions cover almost 20 percent of the continents' surface,
p44
aVand we know actually that speleologists in the last 50 years
p45
aVhave explored roughly 30,000 kilometers of cave passages around the world,
p46
aVwhich is a big number.
p47
aVBut geologists have estimated that what is still missing,
p48
aVto be discovered and mapped,
p49
aVis something around 10 million kilometers.
p50
aa(lp51
VThat means that for each meter of a cave that we already know,
p52
aVthat we have explored,
p53
aVthere are still some tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages.
p54
aVThat means that this is really an endless continent,
p55
aVand we will never be able to explore it completely.
p56
aVAnd this estimation is made without considering other types of caves,
p57
aVlike, for example, inside glaciers or even volcanic caves,
p58
aVwhich are not karstic, but are formed by lava flows.
p59
aVAnd if we have a look at other planets like, for example, Mars,
p60
aVyou will see that this characteristic
p61
aVis not so specific of our home planet.
p62
aVHowever, I will show to you now that we do not need to go to Mars
p63
aVto explore alien worlds.
p64
aa(lp65
VI'm a speleologist, that means a cave explorer.
p66
aVAnd I started with this passion when I was really young
p67
aVin the mountains not far from my hometown in North Italy,
p68
aVin the karstic regions of the Alps and the Dolomites.
p69
aVBut soon, the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner
p70
aVof the planet, searching for new potential entrances
p71
aVof this undiscovered continent.
p72
aVAnd in 2009, I had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains,
p73
aVwhich are in the Orinoco and Amazon basins.
p74
aVThese massifs enchanted me from the first time I saw them.
p75
aVThey are surrounded by vertical, vertiginous rock walls
p76
aVwith silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest.
p77
aVThey really inspired in me a sense of wilderness,
p78
aVwith a soul older than millions and millions of years.
p79
aVAnd this dramatic landscape inspired among other things
p80
aValso Conan Doyle's "The Lost World" novel in 1912.
p81
aVAnd they are, really, a lost world.
p82
aVScientists consider those mountains as islands in time,
p83
aVbeing separated from the surrounding lowlands
p84
aVsince tens of millions of years ago.
p85
aVThey are surrounded by up to 1,000-meter-high walls,
p86
aVresembling a fortress, impregnable by humans.
p87
aVAnd, in fact, only a few of these mountains have been climbed
p88
aVand explored on their top.
p89
aa(lp90
VThese mountains contain also a scientific paradox:
p91
aVThey are made by quartz,
p92
aVwhich is a very common mineral on the earth's crust,
p93
aVand the rock made up by quartz is called quartzite,
p94
aVand quartzite is one of the hardest and least soluble minerals on earth.
p95
aVSo we do not expect at all to find a cave there.
p96
aVDespite this, in the last 10 years, speleologists from Italy,
p97
aVSlovakia, Czech Republic, and, of course, Venezuela and Brazil,
p98
aVhave explored several caves in this area.
p99
aVSo how can it be possible?
p100
aa(lp101
VTo understand this contradiction, we have to consider the time factor,
p102
aVbecause the history of the tepuis is extremely long,
p103
aVstarting about 1.6 billion years ago with the formation of the rock,
p104
aVand then evolving with the uplift of the region 150 million years ago,
p105
aVafter the disruption of the Pangaea supercontinent
p106
aVand the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.
p107
aVSo you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years
p108
aVto sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis' surfaces,
p109
aVbut also to open the fractures and form stone cities, rock cities,
p110
aVfields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of the tepuis.
p111
aVBut nobody could have imagined
p112
aVwhat was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd so I was focusing in 2010 on one of those massifs,
p115
aVthe Auyán-tepui, which is very famous because it hosts Angel Falls,
p116
aVwhich is the highest waterfall in the world \u2014
p117
aVabout 979 meters of vertical drop.
p118
aVAnd I was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems
p119
aVthrough satellite images,
p120
aVand finally we identified an area of collapses of the surface \u2014
p121
aVso, big boulders, rock piles \u2014
p122
aVand that means that there was a void below.
p123
aVIt was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo we did several attempts to reach this area,
p126
aVby land and with a helicopter,
p127
aVbut it was really difficult because \u2014 you have to imagine
p128
aVthat these mountains are covered by clouds most of the year, by fog.
p129
aVThere are strong winds,
p130
aVand there are almost 4,000 millimeters of rainfall per year,
p131
aVso it's really, really difficult to find good conditions.
p132
aVAnd only in 2013 we finally landed on the spot
p133
aVand we started the exploration of the cave.
p134
aa(lp135
VThe cave is huge.
p136
aVIt's a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau,
p137
aVand in only ten days of expedition,
p138
aVwe explored more than 20 kilometers of cave passages.
p139
aVAnd it's a huge network of underground rivers,
p140
aVchannels, big rooms, extremely deep shafts.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo it's really an incredible place.
p143
aVAnd we named it Imawarì Yeuta.
p144
aVThat means, in the Pemón indigenous language, "The House of the Gods."
p145
aVYou have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there.
p146
aVIt was impossible for them to reach this area.
p147
aVHowever, there were legends about the existence
p148
aVof a cave in the mountain.
p149
aVSo when we started the exploration,
p150
aVwe had to explore with a great respect,
p151
aVboth because of the religious beliefs of the indigenous people,
p152
aVbut also because it was really a sacred place,
p153
aVbecause no human had entered there before.
p154
aVSo we had to use special protocols
p155
aVto not contaminate the environment with our presence,
p156
aVand we tried also to share with the community,
p157
aVwith the indigenous community, our discoveries.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd the caves represent, really, a snapshot of the past.
p160
aVThe time needed for their formation
p161
aVcould be as long as 50 or even 100 million years,
p162
aVwhich makes them possibly the oldest caves that we can explore on earth.
p163
aVWhat you can find there is really evidence of a lost world.
p164
aa(lp165
VWhen you enter a quartzite cave,
p166
aVyou have to completely forget what you know about caves \u2014
p167
aVclassic limestone caves or the touristic caves
p168
aVthat you can visit in several places in the world.
p169
aVBecause what seems a simple stalactite here
p170
aVis not made by calcium carbonate, but is made by opal,
p171
aVand one of those stalactites can require tens of millions of years to be formed.
p172
aVBut you can find even stranger forms, like these mushrooms of silica
p173
aVgrowing on a boulder.
p174
aVAnd you can imagine our talks when we were exploring the cave.
p175
aVWe were the first entering and discovering those unknown things,
p176
aVthings like those monster eggs.
p177
aVAnd we were a bit scared because it was all a discovery,
p178
aVand we didn't want to find a dinosaur.
p179
aVWe didn't find a dinosaur.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VAnyway, actually, we know that this kind of formation,
p184
aVafter several studies,
p185
aVwe know that these kinds of formations are living organisms.
p186
aVThey are bacterial colonies using silica to build mineral structures
p187
aVresembling stromatolites.
p188
aVStromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth.
p189
aVAnd here in the tepuis,
p190
aVthe interesting thing is that these bacteria colonies have evolved
p191
aVin complete isolation from the external surface,
p192
aVand without being in contact with humans.
p193
aVThey have never been in contact with humans.
p194
aVSo the implications for science are enormous,
p195
aVbecause here you could find, for example, microbes
p196
aVthat could be useful to resolve diseases in medicine,
p197
aVor you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties.
p198
aVAnd, in fact, we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science,
p199
aVwhich is rossiantonite, a phosphate-sulfate.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo whatever you find in the cave, even a small cricket,
p202
aVhas evolved in the dark in complete isolation.
p203
aVAnd, really, everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections
p204
aVbetween the biological and the mineralogical world.
p205
aVSo as we explore this dark continent
p206
aVand discover its mineralogical and biological diversity and uniqueness,
p207
aVwe will find probably clues about the origin of life on our planet
p208
aVand on the relationship and evolution of life
p209
aVin relationship with the mineral world.
p210
aVWhat seems only a dark, empty environment
p211
aVcould be in reality a chest of wonders
p212
aVfull of useful information.
p213
aa(lp214
VWith a team of Italian, Venezuelan and Brazilian speleologists,
p215
aVwhich is called La Venta Teraphosa,
p216
aVwe will be back soon to Latin America,
p217
aVbecause we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the Amazon.
p218
aVThere are still very unknown mountains,
p219
aVlike Marahuaca, which is almost 3,000 meters high above sea level,
p220
aVor Aracà, which is in the upper region of Rio Negro in Brazil.
p221
aVAnd we suppose that we could find there even bigger cave systems,
p222
aVand each one with its own undiscovered world.
p223
aa(lp224
VThank you.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Applause)
p227
aa(lp228
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Francesco. Give me that to start so we don't forget.
p229
aVFrancesco, you said we don't need to go to Mars to find alien life,
p230
aVand indeed, last time we spoke, you were in Sardinia
p231
aVand you were training European astronauts.
p232
aVSo what do you, a speleologist, tell and teach to the astronauts?
p233
aa(lp234
VFrancesco Sauro: Yeah, we are \u2014 it's a program of training
p235
aVfor not only European, but also NASA, Roskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave.
p236
aVSo they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation.
p237
aVThey have to work together in a real, real dangerous environment,
p238
aVand it's a real alien environment for them because it's unusual.
p239
aVIt's always dark. They have to do science. They have a lot of tasks.
p240
aVAnd it's very similar to a journey to Mars
p241
aVor the International Space Station.
p242
aa(lp243
VBG: In principle. FS: Yes.
p244
aa(lp245
VBG: I want to go back to one of the pictures
p246
aVthat was in your slide show,
p247
aVand it's just representative of the other photos \u2014
p248
aa(lp249
VWeren't those photos amazing? Yeah?
p250
aa(lp251
VAudience: Yeah!
p252
aa(lp253
V(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VFS: I have to thank the photographers from the team La Venta,
p256
aVbecause all of those photos are from the photographers.
p257
aa(lp258
VBG: You bring, actually, photographers with you in the expedition.
p259
aVThey're professionals, they're speleologists and photographers.
p260
aVBut when I look at these pictures, I wonder: there is zero light down there,
p261
aVand yet they look incredibly well-exposed.
p262
aVHow do you take these pictures?
p263
aVHow do your colleagues, the photographers, take these pictures?
p264
aa(lp265
VFS: Yeah. They are working in a darkroom, basically,
p266
aVso you can open the shutter of the camera
p267
aVand use the lights to paint the environment.
p268
aa(lp269
VBG: So you're basically \u2014
p270
aa(lp271
VFS: Yes. You can even keep the shutter open for one minute
p272
aVand then paint the environment.
p273
aVThe final result is what you want to achieve.
p274
aa(lp275
VBG: You spray the environment with light and that's what you get.
p276
aVMaybe we can try this at home someday, I don't know.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VBG: Francesco, grazie. FS: Grazie.

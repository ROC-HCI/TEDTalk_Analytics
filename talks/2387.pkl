VGreat things happen at intersections.
p5
aVIn fact, I would argue that some of the most interesting things
p6
aVof the human experience occur at the intersections,
p7
aVin the liminal space,
p8
aVwhere by liminal I mean the space in-between.
p9
aVThere's freedom in that in-between,
p10
aVfreedom to create from the indefiniteness of not-quite-here, not-quite-there,
p11
aVa new self-definition.
p12
aVSome of the great intersections of the world come to mind,
p13
aVlike the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,
p14
aVor Times Square in New York City,
p15
aVboth bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people.
p16
aVOther intersections,
p17
aVlike the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama,
p18
aVor Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind
p19
aVbecause of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings,
p20
aVideologies and the ongoing struggle for justice.
p21
aa(lp22
VBeyond the physical landscape of our planet,
p23
aVsome of the most famous celestial images are of intersections.
p24
aVStars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust,
p25
aVinstigated by gravity's irrevocable pull.
p26
aVStars die by this same intersection, this time flung outward
p27
aVin a violent collision of smaller atoms,
p28
aVintersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things.
p29
aVWe can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us.
p30
aVTo be intersectional, then,
p31
aVis to occupy a position at an intersection.
p32
aa(lp33
VI've lived the entirety of my life in the in-between,
p34
aVin the liminal space between dreams and reality,
p35
aVrace and gender,
p36
aVpoverty and plenty,
p37
aVscience and society.
p38
aVI am both black and a woman.
p39
aVLike the birth of stars in the heavenlies,
p40
aVthis robust combination of knowing results in a shining example
p41
aVof the explosive fusion of identities.
p42
aa(lp43
VI am also an astrophysicist.
p44
aVI study blazars, supermassive, hyperactive black holes
p45
aVthat sit at the centers of massive galaxies
p46
aVand shoot out jets nearby those black holes
p47
aVat speeds approaching the speed of light
p48
aVin a process we are still trying to completely understand.
p49
aa(lp50
VI have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist
p51
aVsince I was 12 years old.
p52
aVI had no idea that at that time,
p53
aVaccording to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive of African-American women in physics,
p54
aVonly 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD
p55
aVin a physics-related discipline,
p56
aVand that the first black woman to graduate with a PhD in an astronomy-related field
p57
aVdid so just one year before my birth.
p58
aa(lp59
VAs I journeyed along my path,
p60
aVI encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection:
p61
aVthe tremendous opportunity to self-define,
p62
aVthe collision of expectation and experience,
p63
aVthe exhilaration of victorious breakthroughs
p64
aVand, sometimes,
p65
aVthe explosive pain of regeneration.
p66
aa(lp67
VI began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart.
p68
aVOur financial situation disintegrated
p69
aVjust after my father's departure from our lives.
p70
aVThis thrust my mother, my sister and I
p71
aVout of the relative comfort of middle-class life
p72
aVand into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet.
p73
aVThus, I was one of roughly 60 percent of women of color
p74
aVwho find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals.
p75
aVThankfully, Norfolk State University provided me with full funding,
p76
aVand I was able to achieve my bachelor's in physics.
p77
aa(lp78
VAfter graduation, and despite knowing that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics,
p79
aVI fell through the cracks.
p80
aVIt was a poster that saved my dream,
p81
aVand some really incredible people and programs.
p82
aVThe American Physical Society had this beautiful poster
p83
aVencouraging students of color to become physicists.
p84
aVIt was striking to me because it featured a young black girl,
p85
aVprobably around 12 years old,
p86
aVlooking studiously at some physics equations.
p87
aVI remember thinking
p88
aVI was looking directly back at the little girl
p89
aVwho first dared to dream this dream.
p90
aVI immediately wrote to the Society
p91
aVand requested my personal copy of the poster,
p92
aVwhich to this day still hangs in my office.
p93
aVI described to them in the email my educational path,
p94
aVand my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the PhD.
p95
aVThey directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt University Bridge Program,
p96
aVitself an intersection of the master's and PhD degrees
p97
aVat two institutions.
p98
aVAfter two years out of school, they accepted me into the program,
p99
aVand I found myself again on the path to the PhD.
p100
aa(lp101
VAfter receiving my master's at Fisk,
p102
aVI went on to Yale to complete my PhD.
p103
aVOnce I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way
p104
aVto my childhood aspirations,
p105
aVI anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VIt became immediately apparent
p110
aVthat not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality
p111
aVin their space.
p112
aVI was ostracized by many of my classmates,
p113
aVone of whom went so far as to invite me to "do what I really came here to do"
p114
aVas he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up.
p115
aVI wish that were an isolated occurrence,
p116
aVbut for many women of color
p117
aVin science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM,
p118
aVthis is something they have long endured.
p119
aVOne hundred percent of the 60 women of color
p120
aVinterviewed in a recent study by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings
p121
aVreported facing racialized gender bias,
p122
aVincluding being mistaken for the janitorial staff.
p123
aVThis mistaken identity was not reported
p124
aVby any of the white women interviewed for this study,
p125
aVwhich comprised 557 women in total.
p126
aVWhile there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position,
p127
aVand in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college
p128
aVbecause many of their parents worked these jobs,
p129
aVit was a clear attempt to put me in my place.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhile there was certainly the acute pain of the encounter,
p132
aVthe real issue is that my appearance
p133
aVcan tell anyone anything about my ability.
p134
aVBeyond that, though, it underscores
p135
aVthat the women of color in STEM do not experience the same set of barriers
p136
aVthat just women or just people of color face.
p137
aVThat's why today I want to highlight women of color in STEM,
p138
aVwho are inexorably, unapologetically
p139
aVliving as the inseparable sum of identities.
p140
aa(lp141
VSTEM itself is an intersectional term,
p142
aVsuch that its true richness cannot be appreciated
p143
aVwithout considering the liminal space between disciplines.
p144
aVScience, the pursuit of understanding the physical world
p145
aVby way of chemistry, physics, biology,
p146
aVcannot be accomplished in the absence of mathematics.
p147
aVEngineering requires the application of basic science and math
p148
aVto the lived experience.
p149
aVTechnology sits firmly on the foundation of math,
p150
aVengineering and science.
p151
aVMath itself serves the critical role of Rosetta Stone,
p152
aVdecoding and encoding the physical principles of the world.
p153
aVSTEM is utterly incomplete without each individual piece.
p154
aVThis is to say nothing of the enrichment that is realized
p155
aVwhen STEM is combined with other disciplines.
p156
aa(lp157
VThe purpose for this talk is twofold:
p158
aVfirst, to say directly to every black, Latina, indigenous, First Nation
p159
aVor any other woman or girl
p160
aVwho finds herself resting at the blessed intersection
p161
aVof race and gender,
p162
aVthat you can be anything you want to be.
p163
aVMy personal hope is that you'll become an astrophysicist,
p164
aVbut beyond that, anything you want.
p165
aVDo not think for one minute
p166
aVthat because you are who you are,
p167
aVyou cannot be who you imagine yourself to be.
p168
aVHold fast to those dreams
p169
aVand let them carry you into a world you can't even imagine.
p170
aa(lp171
VSecondly, among the most pressing issues of our time,
p172
aVmost now find their intersection with STEM.
p173
aVWe have as a global society solved
p174
aVmost of the single-faceted issues of our time.
p175
aVThose that remain require a thorough investigation
p176
aVof the liminal space between disciplines
p177
aVto create the multifaceted solutions of tomorrow.
p178
aVWho better to solve these liminal problems
p179
aVthan those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections.
p180
aVWe as thought leaders and decision makers
p181
aVmust push past the first steps of diversity
p182
aVand into the richer and more robust territory
p183
aVof full inclusion and equal opportunity.
p184
aa(lp185
VOne of my favorite examples of liminal excellence
p186
aVcomes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander,
p187
aVa black woman plasma physicist,
p188
aVwho passed away this past July after a 10-year bout with breast cancer.
p189
aVShe was a NASA project scientist who spearheaded the NASA side
p190
aVof the Rosetta mission,
p191
aVwhich became famous this year for landing a rover on a comet,
p192
aVand the 1.5 billion dollar Galileo mission to Jupiter,
p193
aVtwo high-profile scientific victories
p194
aVfor NASA, the United States and the world.
p195
aVDr. Alexander said it this way:
p196
aV"I'm used to walking between two cultures.
p197
aVFor me, it's among the purposes of my life
p198
aVto take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding
p199
aVwith bold exploration that you can't do every day."
p200
aa(lp201
VThis shows exactly the power of a liminal person.
p202
aVShe had the technical ability to spearhead
p203
aVsome of the most ambitious space missions of our time,
p204
aVand she perfectly understood her place
p205
aVof being exactly who she was in any place she was.
p206
aa(lp207
VJessica Matthews, inventor of the SOCCKET line of sports products,
p208
aVlike soccer balls, that generate renewable energy as you play with them,
p209
aVsaid it this way:
p210
aV"A major part of invention isn't just creating things,
p211
aVit's understanding people
p212
aVand understanding the systems that make this world."
p213
aVThe reason I tell my story
p214
aVand the story of Dr. Alexander and Jessica Matthews
p215
aVis because they are fundamentally intersectional stories,
p216
aVthe stories of lives lived at the nexus of race, gender and innovation.
p217
aa(lp218
VDespite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space,
p219
aVI'm proud to report that when I graduated,
p220
aVI was the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics
p221
aVin Yale's then 312-year history.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VI am now part of a small but growing cadre of women of color in STEM
p226
aVwho are poised to bring new perspectives and new ideas to life
p227
aVon the most pressing issues of our time:
p228
aVthings like educational inequities,
p229
aVpolice brutality, HIV/AIDS, climate change, genetic editing,
p230
aVartificial intelligence and Mars exploration.
p231
aVThis is to say nothing of the things we haven't even thought of yet.
p232
aa(lp233
VWomen of color in STEM occupy some of the toughest
p234
aVand most exciting sociotechnological issues of our time.
p235
aVThus, we are uniquely positioned
p236
aVto contribute to and drive these conversations
p237
aVin ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience.
p238
aVThis outlook can be expanded to the many intersectional people
p239
aVwhose experiences, positive and negative,
p240
aVenrich the conversations in ways that outmatch
p241
aVeven the best-resourced homogenous groups.
p242
aa(lp243
VThis is not a request born out of a desire to fit in.
p244
aVIt's a reminder that we cannot get to the best possible outcomes
p245
aVfor the totality of humanity
p246
aVwithout precisely this collaboration,
p247
aVthis bringing together of the liminal,
p248
aVthe differently lived, distinctly experienced
p249
aVand disparately impacted.
p250
aVSimply put, we cannot be the most excellent expression
p251
aVof our collective genius
p252
aVwithout the full measure of humanity brought to bear.
p253
aa(lp254
VThank you.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Applause)

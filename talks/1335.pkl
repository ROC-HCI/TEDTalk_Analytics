VIt is actually a reality today
p5
aVthat you can download products from the Web \u2014
p6
aVproduct data, I should say, from the Web \u2014
p7
aVperhaps tweak it and personalize it
p8
aVto your own preference or your own taste,
p9
aVand have that information sent
p10
aVto a desktop machine
p11
aVthat will fabricate it for you on the spot.
p12
aVWe can actually build for you,
p13
aVvery rapidly,
p14
aVa physical object.
p15
aVAnd the reason we can do this
p16
aVis through an emerging technology
p17
aVcalled additive manufacturing,
p18
aVor 3D printing.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis is a 3D printer.
p21
aVThey have been around
p22
aVfor almost 30 years now,
p23
aVwhich is quite amazing to think of,
p24
aVbut they're only just starting
p25
aVto filter into the public arena.
p26
aVAnd typically, you would take data,
p27
aVlike the data of a pen here,
p28
aVwhich would be a geometric representation of that product in 3D,
p29
aVand we would pass that data with material
p30
aVinto a machine.
p31
aVAnd a process that would happen in the machine
p32
aVwould mean layer by layer that product would be built.
p33
aVAnd we can take out the physical product,
p34
aVand ready to use,
p35
aVor to, perhaps, assemble into something else.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut if these machines have been around for almost 30 years,
p38
aVwhy don't we know about them?
p39
aVBecause typically they've been too inefficient,
p40
aVinaccessible,
p41
aVthey've not been fast enough,
p42
aVthey've been quite expensive.
p43
aVBut today,
p44
aVit is becoming a reality
p45
aVthat they are now becoming successful.
p46
aVMany barriers are breaking down.
p47
aVThat means that you guys
p48
aVwill soon be able to access one of these machines,
p49
aVif not this minute.
p50
aVAnd it will change and disrupt
p51
aVthe landscape of manufacturing,
p52
aVand most certainly our lives, our businesses
p53
aVand the lives of our children.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo how does it work?
p56
aVIt typically reads CAD data,
p57
aVwhich is a product design data
p58
aVcreated on professional product design programs.
p59
aVAnd here you can see an engineer \u2014
p60
aVit could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer \u2014
p61
aVcreate a product in 3D.
p62
aVAnd this data gets sent to a machine
p63
aVthat slices the data
p64
aVinto two-dimensional representations of that product
p65
aVall the way through \u2014
p66
aValmost like slicing it like salami.
p67
aVAnd that data, layer by layer, gets passed through the machine,
p68
aVstarting at the base of the product
p69
aVand depositing material, layer upon layer,
p70
aVinfusing the new layer of materials to the old layer
p71
aVin an additive process.
p72
aVAnd this material that's deposited
p73
aVeither starts as a liquid form
p74
aVor a material powder form.
p75
aVAnd the bonding process can happen
p76
aVby either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.
p77
aVIn this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.
p78
aVIt's actually using a laser
p79
aVto fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.
p80
aVAnd over time \u2014
p81
aVquite rapidly actually, in a number of hours \u2014
p82
aVwe can build a physical product,
p83
aVready to take out of the machine and use.
p84
aVAnd this is quite an extraordinary idea,
p85
aVbut it is reality today.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo all these products that you can see on the screen
p88
aVwere made in the same way.
p89
aVThey were all 3D printed.
p90
aVAnd you can see,
p91
aVthey're ranging from shoes,
p92
aVrings that were made out of stainless steal,
p93
aVphone covers out of plastic,
p94
aVall the way through to spinal implants, for example,
p95
aVthat were created out of medical-grade titanium,
p96
aVand engine parts.
p97
aVBut what you'll notice about all of these products
p98
aVis they're very, very intricate.
p99
aVThe design is quite extraordinary.
p100
aVBecause we're taking this data in 3D form,
p101
aVslicing it up before it gets past the machine,
p102
aVwe can actually create structures
p103
aVthat are more intricate
p104
aVthan any other manufacturing technology \u2014
p105
aVor, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way.
p106
aVAnd you can create parts with moving components,
p107
aVhinges, parts within parts.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo in some cases, we can abolish totally
p110
aVthe need for manual labor.
p111
aVIt sounds great.
p112
aVIt is great.
p113
aVWe can have 3D printers today
p114
aVthat build structures like these.
p115
aVThis is almost three meters high.
p116
aVAnd this was built
p117
aVby depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer
p118
aVin layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness \u2014
p119
aVslowly growing this structure.
p120
aVThis was created by an architectural firm called Shiro.
p121
aVAnd you can actually walk into it.
p122
aVAnd on the other end of the spectrum,
p123
aVthis is a microstructure.
p124
aVIt's created depositing layers
p125
aVof about four microns.
p126
aVSo really the resolution is quite incredible.
p127
aVThe detail that you can get today
p128
aVis quite amazing.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo who's using it?
p131
aVTypically, because we can create products very rapidly,
p132
aVit's been used by product designers,
p133
aVor anyone who wanted to prototype a product
p134
aVand very quickly create or reiterate a design.
p135
aVAnd actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well
p136
aVis that you can create bespoke products en masse.
p137
aVThere's very little economies of scale.
p138
aVSo you can now create one-offs very easily.
p139
aVArchitects, for example,
p140
aVthey want to create prototypes of buildings.
p141
aVAgain you can see,
p142
aVthis is a building of the Free University in Berlin
p143
aVand it was designed by Foster and Partners.
p144
aVAgain, not buildable in any other way.
p145
aVAnd very hard to even create this by hand.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow this is an engine component.
p148
aVIt was developed by a company called Within Technologies
p149
aVand 3T RPD.
p150
aVIt's very, very, very detailed
p151
aVinside with the design.
p152
aVNow 3D printing
p153
aVcan break away barriers in design
p154
aVwhich challenge the constraints
p155
aVof mass production.
p156
aVIf we slice into this product which is actually sitting here,
p157
aVyou can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it,
p158
aVwhich means it's a more efficient product.
p159
aVYou can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques
p160
aVeven if you tried to do it manually.
p161
aVIt's more efficient
p162
aVbecause we can now create all these cavities within the object
p163
aVthat cool fluid.
p164
aVAnd it's used by aerospace
p165
aVand automotive.
p166
aVIt's a lighter part
p167
aVand it uses less material waste.
p168
aVSo it's overall performance and efficiency
p169
aVjust exceeds standard mass produced products.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd then taking this idea
p172
aVof creating a very detailed structure,
p173
aVwe can apply it to honeycomb structures
p174
aVand use them within implants.
p175
aVTypically an implant
p176
aVis more effective within the body
p177
aVif it's more porous,
p178
aVbecause our body tissue will grow into it.
p179
aVThere's a lower chance of rejection.
p180
aVBut it's very hard to create that in standard ways.
p181
aVWith 3D printing,
p182
aVwe're seeing today
p183
aVthat we can create much better implants.
p184
aVAnd in fact, because we can create
p185
aVbespoke products en masse, one-offs,
p186
aVwe can create implants
p187
aVthat are specific to individuals.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo as you can see,
p190
aVthis technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.
p191
aVAnd we're starting to see it being used
p192
aVfor final end products.
p193
aVAnd in fact, as the detail is improving,
p194
aVthe quality is improving,
p195
aVthe price of the machines are falling
p196
aVand they're becoming quicker.
p197
aVThey're also now small enough
p198
aVto sit on a desktop.
p199
aVYou can buy a machine today for about $300
p200
aVthat you can create yourself,
p201
aVwhich is quite incredible.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut then it begs the question,
p204
aVwhy don't we all have one in our home?
p205
aVBecause, simply, most of us here today
p206
aVdon't know how to create the data
p207
aVthat a 3D printer reads.
p208
aVIf I gave you a 3D printer,
p209
aVyou wouldn't know how to direct it
p210
aVto make what you want it to.
p211
aVBut there are more and more
p212
aVtechnologies, software and processes today
p213
aVthat are breaking down those barriers.
p214
aVI believe we're at a tipping point
p215
aVwhere this is now something
p216
aVthat we can't avoid.
p217
aVThis technology
p218
aVis really going to disrupt
p219
aVthe landscape of manufacturing
p220
aVand, I believe, cause a revolution
p221
aVin manufacturing.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo today,
p224
aVyou can download products from the Web \u2014
p225
aVanything you would have on your desktop,
p226
aVlike pens, whistles, lemon squeezers.
p227
aVYou can use software like Google SketchUp
p228
aVto create products from scratch
p229
aVvery easily.
p230
aV3D printing can be also used
p231
aVto download spare parts from the Web.
p232
aVSo imagine you have, say,
p233
aVa Hoover in your home
p234
aVand it has broken down. You need a spare part,
p235
aVbut you realize that Hoover's been discontinued.
p236
aVCan you imagine going online \u2014
p237
aVthis is a reality \u2014
p238
aVand finding that spare part
p239
aVfrom a database of geometries
p240
aVof that discontinued product
p241
aVand downloading that information, that data,
p242
aVand having the product made for you at home,
p243
aVready to use, on your demand?
p244
aVAnd in fact, because we can create spare parts
p245
aVwith things the machines
p246
aVare quite literally making themselves.
p247
aVYou're having machines fabricate themselves.
p248
aVThese are parts of a RepRap machine,
p249
aVwhich is a kind of desktop printer.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut what interests my company the most
p252
aVis the fact that you can create
p253
aVindividual unique products en masse.
p254
aVThere's no need to do a run
p255
aVof thousands of millions
p256
aVor send that product to be injection molded in China.
p257
aVYou can just make it physically on the spot.
p258
aVWhich means
p259
aVthat we can now present to the public
p260
aVthe next generation of customization.
p261
aVThis is something that is now possible today,
p262
aVthat you can direct personally
p263
aVhow you want your products to look.
p264
aa(lp265
VWe're all familiar with the idea
p266
aVof customization or personalization.
p267
aVBrands like Nike are doing it.
p268
aVIt's all over the Web.
p269
aVIn fact, every major household name
p270
aVis allowing you
p271
aVto interact with their products
p272
aVon a daily basis \u2014
p273
aVall the way from Smart Cars
p274
aVto Prada
p275
aVto Ray Ban, for example.
p276
aVBut this is not really mass customization;
p277
aVit's known as variant production,
p278
aVvariations of the same product.
p279
aVWhat you could do is really influence your product now
p280
aVand shape-manipulate your product.
p281
aa(lp282
VI'm not sure about you guys,
p283
aVbut I've had experiences
p284
aVwhen I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted
p285
aVand I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp
p286
aVthat I know where I want to sit in my house
p287
aVand I just can't find the right thing,
p288
aVor that perfect piece of jewelry
p289
aVas a gift or for myself.
p290
aVImagine that you can now
p291
aVengage with a brand
p292
aVand interact,
p293
aVso that you can pass your personal attributes
p294
aVto the products that you're about to buy.
p295
aa(lp296
VYou can today
p297
aVdownload a product with software like this,
p298
aVview the product in 3D.
p299
aVThis is the sort of 3D data
p300
aVthat a machine will read.
p301
aVThis is a lamp.
p302
aVAnd you can start iterating the design.
p303
aVYou can direct what color that product will be,
p304
aVperhaps what material.
p305
aVAnd also, you can engage in shape manipulation of that product,
p306
aVbut within boundaries that are safe.
p307
aVBecause obviously the public are not professional product designers.
p308
aVThe piece of software will keep an individual
p309
aVwithin the bounds of the possible.
p310
aVAnd when somebody is ready to purchase the product
p311
aVin their personalized design,
p312
aVthey click "Enter" and this data gets converted
p313
aVinto the data that a 3D printer reads
p314
aVand gets passed to a 3D printer,
p315
aVperhaps on someone's desktop.
p316
aa(lp317
VBut I don't think that that's immediate.
p318
aVI don't think that will happen soon.
p319
aVWhat's more likely, and we're seeing it today,
p320
aVis that data gets sent
p321
aVto a local manufacturing center.
p322
aVThis means lower carbon footprint.
p323
aVWe're now, instead of shipping a product across the world,
p324
aVwe're sending data across the Internet.
p325
aVHere's the product being built.
p326
aVYou can see, this came out of the machine in one piece
p327
aVand the electronics were inserted later.
p328
aVIt's this lamp, as you can see here.
p329
aVSo as long as you have the data,
p330
aVyou can create the part on demand.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd you don't necessarily need to use this
p333
aVfor just aesthetic customization,
p334
aVyou can use it for functional customization,
p335
aVscanning parts of the body
p336
aVand creating things that are made to fit.
p337
aVSo we can run this through to something like prosthetics,
p338
aVwhich is highly specialized to an individual's handicap.
p339
aVOr we can create very specific prosthetics
p340
aVfor that individual.
p341
aVScanning teeth today,
p342
aVyou can have your teeth scanned
p343
aVand dental coatings made in this way to fit you.
p344
aVWhile you wait at the dentist,
p345
aVa machine will quietly be creating this for you
p346
aVready to insert in the teeth.
p347
aa(lp348
VAnd the idea of now creating implants,
p349
aVscanning data, an MRI scan of somebody
p350
aVcan now be converted into 3D data
p351
aVand we can create very specific implants for them.
p352
aVAnd applying this
p353
aVto the idea of building up what's in our bodies.
p354
aVYou know, this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree.
p355
aVIt's very intricate.
p356
aVYou couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way.
p357
aVBut with MRI data,
p358
aVwe can just build the product,
p359
aVas you can see, very intricately.
p360
aVUsing this process,
p361
aVpioneers in the industry are layering up cells today.
p362
aVSo one of the pioneers, for example, is Dr. Anthony Atala,
p363
aVand he has been working
p364
aVon layering cells to create body parts \u2014
p365
aVbladders, valves, kidneys.
p366
aVNow this is not something that's ready for the public,
p367
aVbut it is in working progress.
p368
aa(lp369
VSo just to finalize, we're all individual.
p370
aVWe all have different preferences, different needs.
p371
aVWe like different things.
p372
aVWe're all different sizes and our companies the same.
p373
aVBusinesses want different things.
p374
aVWithout a doubt in my mind,
p375
aVI believe that this technology
p376
aVis going to cause a manufacturing revolution
p377
aVand will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it.
p378
aa(lp379
VThank you.

VAfrica is booming.
p5
aVPer capita incomes since the year 2000
p6
aVhave doubled,
p7
aVand this boom is impacting on everyone.
p8
aVLife expectancy has increased by one year
p9
aVevery three years for the last decade.
p10
aVThat means if an African child is born today,
p11
aVrather than three days ago,
p12
aVthey will get an extra day of life
p13
aVat the end of their lifespan.
p14
aVIt's that quick.
p15
aVAnd HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:
p16
aV600,000 less people a year are getting HIV
p17
aVin sub-Saharan Africa.
p18
aVThe battle against malaria is being won,
p19
aVwith deaths from malaria down 27 percent,
p20
aVaccording to the latest World Bank data.
p21
aVAnd malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.
p22
aVThis shouldn't surprise us,
p23
aVbecause actually, everybody grows.
p24
aVIf you go back to Imperial Rome
p25
aVin the Year 1 A.D.,
p26
aVthere was admittedly about 1,800 years
p27
aVwhere there wasn't an awful lot of growth.
p28
aVBut then the people that the Romans
p29
aVwould have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,
p30
aVwere actually part of the Industrial Revolution,
p31
aVand in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,
p32
aVand you saw that get quicker and quicker,
p33
aVand it's been impacting everyone.
p34
aVIt doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore
p35
aVor the tundra of northern Finland.
p36
aVEverybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when
p37
aVthe inevitable happens.
p38
aa(lp39
VAmong the reasons I think it's happening right now
p40
aVis the quality of the leadership across Africa.
p41
aVI think most of us would agree that in the 1990s,
p42
aVthe greatest politician in the world was African,
p43
aVbut I'm meeting brilliant people
p44
aVacross the continent the entire time,
p45
aVand they're doing the reforms
p46
aVwhich have transformed the economic situation
p47
aVfor their countries.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd the West is engaging with that.
p50
aVThe West has given debt forgiveness programs
p51
aVwhich have halved sub-Saharan debt
p52
aVfrom about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40.
p53
aVAt the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120
p54
aVand we're all feeling slightly miserable
p55
aVas a result.
p56
aVPolitics gets weaker when debt is high.
p57
aVWhen public sector debt is low,
p58
aVgovernments don't have to choose
p59
aVbetween investing in education and health
p60
aVand paying interest on that debt you owe.
p61
aVAnd it's not just the public sector which is looking so good.
p62
aVThe private sector as well.
p63
aVAgain, in the West, we have private sector debt
p64
aVof 200 percent of GDP in Spain,
p65
aVthe U.K., and the U.S.
p66
aVThat's an awful lot of debt.
p67
aVAfrica, many African countries,
p68
aVare sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP.
p69
aVIf there's any continent that can do what China has done \u2014
p70
aVChina's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart \u2014
p71
aVif anyone can do what China has done
p72
aVin the last 30 years,
p73
aVit'll be Africa in the next 30.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo they've got great government finances, great private sector debt.
p76
aVDoes anyone recognize this? In fact, they do.
p77
aVForeign direct investment
p78
aVhas poured into Africa in the last 15 years.
p79
aVBack in the '70s,
p80
aVno one touched the continent with a barge pole.
p81
aVAnd this investment is actually Western-led.
p82
aVWe hear a lot about China,
p83
aVand they do lend a lot of money,
p84
aVbut 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years
p85
aVhas come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada.
p86
aVTen percent's come from India.
p87
aVAnd they're investing in energy.
p88
aVAfrica produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now.
p89
aVIt's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia.
p90
aVAnd they're investing in telecoms,
p91
aVshopping malls.
p92
aVAnd this very encouraging story, I think,
p93
aVis partly demographic-led.
p94
aVAnd it's not just about African demographics.
p95
aVI'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds
p96
aVin various parts of the world,
p97
aVand the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second.
p98
aVTen years ago, say you're Foxconn
p99
aVsetting up an iPhone factory, by chance.
p100
aVYou might choose China,
p101
aVwhich is the bulk of that East Asian blue line,
p102
aVwhere there's 200 million young people,
p103
aVand every year until 2010 that's getting bigger.
p104
aVWhich means you're going to have new guys
p105
aVknocking on the door saying, "Give us a job,"
p106
aVand, "I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job."
p107
aVNow, that's completely changed now.
p108
aVThis decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percent
p109
aVfall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China.
p110
aVSo where do you set up your new factory?
p111
aVYou look at South Asia, and people are.
p112
aVThey're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh,
p113
aVand they're also looking at Africa.
p114
aVAnd they're looking at Africa
p115
aVbecause that yellow line is showing you
p116
aVthat the number of young Africans
p117
aVis going to continue to get bigger
p118
aVdecade after decade after decade out to 2050.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, there's a problem with lots of young people
p121
aVcoming into any market,
p122
aVparticularly when they're young men.
p123
aVA bit dangerous, sometimes.
p124
aVI think one of the crucial factors
p125
aVis how educated is that demographic?
p126
aVIf you look at the red line here,
p127
aVwhat you're going to see is that in 1975,
p128
aVjust nine percent of kids
p129
aVwere in secondary school education
p130
aVin sub-Saharan Africa.
p131
aVWould you set up a factory
p132
aVin sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?
p133
aVNobody else did.
p134
aVThey chose instead Turkey and Mexico
p135
aVto set up the textiles factories,
p136
aVbecause their education levels
p137
aVwere 25 to 30 percent.
p138
aVToday, sub-Sahara is at the levels
p139
aVthat Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.
p140
aVThey will get the textiles jobs
p141
aVthat will take people out of rural poverty
p142
aVand put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo what's Africa looking like today?
p145
aVThis is how I look at Africa.
p146
aVIt's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.
p147
aVEach little box is about a billion dollars,
p148
aVand you see that I pay an awful lot of attention
p149
aVto Nigeria sitting there in the middle.
p150
aVSouth Africa is playing a role.
p151
aVBut when I'm thinking about the future,
p152
aVI'm actually most interested
p153
aVin Central, Western and Southern Africa.
p154
aVIf I look at Africa by population,
p155
aVEast Africa stands out
p156
aVas so much potential.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd I'm showing you something else with these maps.
p159
aVI'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.
p160
aVFragile democracies is the beige color.
p161
aVStrong democracies are the orange color.
p162
aVAnd what you'll see here is that most Africans
p163
aVare now living in democracies.
p164
aVWhy does that matter?
p165
aVBecause what people want
p166
aVis what politicians try,
p167
aVthey don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.
p168
aVAnd what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.
p169
aVIn Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,
p170
aVthe battle between the two candidates
p171
aVwas over education.
p172
aVOne guy offered free secondary school education
p173
aVto all, not just 30 percent.
p174
aVThe other guy had to say,
p175
aVI'm going to build 50 new schools.
p176
aVHe won by a margin.
p177
aVSo democracy is encouraging governments
p178
aVto invest in education.
p179
aVEducation is helping growth and investment,
p180
aVand that's giving budget revenues,
p181
aVwhich is giving governments more money,
p182
aVwhich is helping growth through education.
p183
aVIt's a positive, virtuous circle.
p184
aa(lp185
VBut I get asked this question,
p186
aVand this particular question makes me quite sad:
p187
aVIt's, "But what about corruption?
p188
aVHow can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?"
p189
aVAnd what makes me sad about it
p190
aVis that this graph here is showing you
p191
aVthat the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.
p192
aVWhen you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.
p193
aVAnd the countries on the right hand side,
p194
aVyou'll see the per capita GDP,
p195
aVbasically every country
p196
aVwith a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,
p197
aVhas got a corruption score
p198
aVof roughly, what's that, about three?
p199
aVThree out of 10. That's not good.
p200
aVEvery poor country is corrupt.
p201
aVEvery rich country is relatively uncorrupt.
p202
aVHow do you get from poverty and corruption
p203
aVto wealth and less corruption?
p204
aVYou see the middle class grow.
p205
aVAnd the way to do that is to invest,
p206
aVnot to say I'm not investing in that continent
p207
aVbecause there's too much corruption.
p208
aa(lp209
VNow, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.
p210
aVI've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe \u2014
p211
aVnot in Africa, actually.
p212
aVBut what I'm saying here is that
p213
aVwe can make a difference
p214
aVand we can do that by investing.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.
p217
aVEconomists aren't great at forecasting.
p218
aVBecause the question really is, what happens next?
p219
aVAnd if you go back to the year 2000,
p220
aVwhat you'll find is The Economist
p221
aVhad a very famous cover, "The Hopeless Continent,"
p222
aVand what they'd done is they'd looked at growth
p223
aVin Africa over the previous 10 years \u2014 two percent \u2014
p224
aVand they said,
p225
aVwhat's going to happen in the next 10 years?
p226
aVThey assumed two percent,
p227
aVand that made it a pretty hopeless story,
p228
aVbecause population growth was two and a half.
p229
aVPeople got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.
p230
aVNow 2012, The Economist has a new cover,
p231
aVand what does that new cover show?
p232
aVThat new cover shows, well, Africa rising,
p233
aVbecause the growth over the last 10 years
p234
aVhas been about five and a half percent.
p235
aa(lp236
VI would like to see if you can all now become economists,
p237
aVbecause if growth for the last 10 years
p238
aVhas been five and a half percent,
p239
aVwhat do you think the IMF is forecasting
p240
aVfor the next five years of growth in Africa?
p241
aVVery good. I think you're secretly saying
p242
aVto your head, probably five and a half percent.
p243
aVYou're all economists, and I think,
p244
aVlike most economists, wrong.
p245
aVNo offense.
p246
aa(lp247
VWhat I like to do is try and find the countries
p248
aVthat are doing exactly what Africa has already done,
p249
aVand it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing
p250
aVto whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.
p251
aVIndia is one of those examples.
p252
aVThis is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.
p253
aVIgnore the scale on the bottom for a second.
p254
aVActually, for the first 20 years,
p255
aVthe '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.
p256
aVIt grew at two percent
p257
aVwhen population growth was about two and a half.
p258
aVIf that's familiar, that's exactly what happened
p259
aVin sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.
p260
aVAnd then something happened in 1980.
p261
aVBoom! India began to explode.
p262
aVIt wasn't a "Hindu rate of growth,"
p263
aV"democracies can't grow." Actually India could.
p264
aVAnd if I lay sub-Saharan growth
p265
aVon top of the Indian growth story,
p266
aVit's remarkably similar.
p267
aVTwenty years of not much growth
p268
aVand a trend line which is actually telling you
p269
aVthat sub-Saharan African growth is
p270
aVslightly better than India.
p271
aVAnd if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,
p272
aVI'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,
p273
aVI'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,
p274
aVI can draw out some forecasts
p275
aVfor the next 30 to 40 years
p276
aVwhich I think are better
p277
aVthan the ones where you're looking backwards.
p278
aVAnd that tells me this:
p279
aVthat Africa is going to go
p280
aVfrom a $2 trillion economy today
p281
aVto a $29 trillion economy by 2050.
p282
aVNow that's bigger than Europe and America
p283
aVput together in today's money.
p284
aVLife expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.
p285
aVThe population's going to double
p286
aVfrom one billion to two billion,
p287
aVso household incomes are going to go up sevenfold
p288
aVin the next 35 years.
p289
aVAnd when I present this in Africa \u2014
p290
aVNairobi, Lagos, Accra \u2014 I get one question.
p291
aV"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?"
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd you know what?
p294
aVActually, I think they've got a point.
p295
aVAm I really saying that there can be nothing learned,
p296
aVyes from the positives in Asia and India,
p297
aVbut also the negatives?
p298
aVPerhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.
p299
aVSurely, the technologies that we're talking about here
p300
aVthis last week,
p301
aVsurely some of these can perhaps
p302
aVhelp Africa grow even faster?
p303
aVAnd I think here we can play a role.
p304
aVBecause technology does let you help.
p305
aVYou can go and download
p306
aVsome of the great African literature
p307
aVfrom the Internet now.
p308
aVNo, not right now, just 30 seconds.
p309
aVYou can go and buy some of the great tunes.
p310
aVMy iPod's full of them.
p311
aVBuy African products.
p312
aVGo on holiday and see for yourself
p313
aVthe change that's happening.
p314
aVInvest.
p315
aVPerhaps hire people, give them the skills
p316
aVthat they can take back to Africa,
p317
aVand their companies will grow an awful lot faster
p318
aVthan most of ours here in the West.
p319
aVAnd then you and I can help make sure
p320
aVthat for Africa, the 21st century is their century.
p321
aa(lp322
VThank you very much.

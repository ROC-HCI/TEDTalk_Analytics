VTwenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read
p5
aVa newspaper article which said
p6
aVthat one day syringes would be
p7
aVone of the major causes of the spread of AIDS,
p8
aVthe transmission of AIDS.
p9
aVI thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it.
p10
aa(lp11
VSadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know,
p12
aVkills approximately one million people a year.
p13
aVThe reuse of syringes now exceeds that
p14
aVand kills 1.3 million people a year.
p15
aVThis young girl and her friend
p16
aVthat I met in an orphanage in Delhi
p17
aVwere HIV positive from a syringe.
p18
aVAnd what was so sad about this particular story
p19
aVwas that once their parents had found out \u2014
p20
aVand don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor \u2014
p21
aVthe parents threw them out on the street.
p22
aVAnd hence they ended up in an orphanage.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd it comes from situations like this where
p25
aVyou have either skilled or unskilled practitioners,
p26
aVblindly giving an injection to someone.
p27
aVAnd the injection is so valuable,
p28
aVthat the people basically trust
p29
aVthe doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times,
p30
aVto do the right thing. But in fact they're not.
p31
aVAnd you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem
p32
aVbetween people in high-virus areas.
p33
aa(lp34
VThis video we took undercover,
p35
aVwhich shows you, over a half an hour period,
p36
aVa tray of medicines of 42 vials,
p37
aVwhich are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.
p38
aVAnd over the course of half an hour, not one syringe
p39
aVwas filmed being unwrapped.
p40
aVThey started with two and they ended with two.
p41
aVAnd you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,
p42
aVwhich is their sort of modular station,
p43
aVand dropping the syringe she's just used
p44
aVback in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.
p45
aVSo you can imagine the scale of this problem.
p46
aVAnd in fact in India alone, 62 percent
p47
aVof all injections given
p48
aVare unsafe.
p49
aa(lp50
VThese kids in Pakistan don't go to school.
p51
aVThey are lucky. They already have a job.
p52
aVAnd that job is that they go around and pick up syringes
p53
aVfrom the back of hospitals,
p54
aVwash them, and in the course of this,
p55
aVobviously picking them up they injure themselves.
p56
aVAnd then they repackage them and sell them out on markets
p57
aVfor literally more money
p58
aVthan a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.
p59
aVIn an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,
p60
aVpicked up a syringe and pricked his finger \u2014
p61
aVI don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end \u2014
p62
aVand immediately whipped out a box of matches,
p63
aVlit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,
p64
aVgiving me full assurance
p65
aVthat that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.
p66
aa(lp67
VIn China, recycling is a major issue.
p68
aVAnd they are collected en mass \u2014 you can see the scale of it here \u2014
p69
aVand sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes,
p70
aVand then put back out on the street.
p71
aVSo recycling and reuse
p72
aVare the major issues here.
p73
aVBut there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia.
p74
aVIn all schools in Indonesia,
p75
aVthere is usually a toy seller in the playground.
p76
aVThe toy seller, in this case,
p77
aVhad syringes, which they usually do,
p78
aVnext door to the diggers, which is obviously
p79
aVwhat you would expect.
p80
aVAnd they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols.
p81
aVThey squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.
p82
aVAnd they are having great fun.
p83
aVBut they also drink from them
p84
aVwhile they're in their breaks, because it's hot.
p85
aVAnd they squirt the water into their mouths.
p86
aVAnd these are used with traces of blood visible.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo we need a better product. And we need better information.
p89
aVAnd I think, if I can just borrow this camera,
p90
aVI was going to show you my invention,
p91
aVwhich I came up with.
p92
aVSo, it's a normal-looking syringe.
p93
aVYou load it up in the normal way. This is made
p94
aVon existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.
p95
aVYou give the injection and then put it down.
p96
aVIf someone then tries to reuse it,
p97
aVit locks and breaks afterwards.
p98
aVIt's very, very simple. Thank you.
p99
aV(Applause)
p100
aVAnd it costs the same as a normal syringe.
p101
aVAnd in comparison, a Coca-Cola
p102
aVis 10 times the price.
p103
aVAnd that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd I have an information charity
p106
aVwhich has done huge scale amount of work in India.
p107
aVAnd we're very proud of giving information to people,
p108
aVso that little kids like this don't do stupid things.
p109
aVThank you very much.
p110
aV(Applause)

But he hasn&#39;t stopped there: In 2005, he founded a nonprofit, <a href=\\"http://www.safepointtrust.org/SafePoint_Website/home.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">SafePoint</a>, which aims to educate people in the developing world about the dangers of reusing any instruments that come into contact with blood. </p>", "slug": "marc_koska", "whotheyare": "Marc Koska wants to improve health care in the developing world by re-designing dangerous medical tools -- and offering education to practitioners in under-funded clinics.", "whatotherssay": "As a member of Parliament with an interest in HIV and AIDS, to learn of Marc\'s work with Star Syringe was an inspiration.

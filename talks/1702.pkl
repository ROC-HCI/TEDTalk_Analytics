VOnce upon a time,
p5
aVthere was a place called Lesterland.
p6
aVNow Lesterland looks a lot like the United States.
p7
aVLike the United States, it has about 311 million people,
p8
aVand of that 311 million people,
p9
aVit turns out 144,000 are called Lester.
p10
aVIf Matt's in the audience,
p11
aVI just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second,
p12
aVthis character from your series.
p13
aVSo 144,000 are called Lester,
p14
aVwhich means about .05 percent is named Lester.
p15
aVNow, Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power.
p16
aVThere are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland.
p17
aVOne is called the general election.
p18
aVThe other is called the Lester election.
p19
aVAnd in the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,
p20
aVbut in the Lester election, it's the Lesters who get to vote.
p21
aVAnd here's the trick.
p22
aVIn order to run in the general election,
p23
aVyou must do extremely well
p24
aVin the Lester election.
p25
aVYou don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, what can we say about democracy in Lesterland?
p28
aVWhat we can say, number one,
p29
aVas the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,
p30
aVthat people have the ultimate influence over elected officials,
p31
aVbecause, after all, there is a general election,
p32
aVbut only after the Lesters have had their way
p33
aVwith the candidates who wish to run in the general election.
p34
aVAnd number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters
p35
aVis going to produce a subtle, understated,
p36
aVwe could say camouflaged, bending
p37
aVto keep the Lesters happy.
p38
aVOkay, so we have a democracy, no doubt,
p39
aVbut it's dependent upon the Lesters
p40
aVand dependent upon the people.
p41
aVIt has competing dependencies,
p42
aVwe could say conflicting dependencies,
p43
aVdepending upon who the Lesters are.
p44
aVOkay. That's Lesterland.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland.
p47
aVNumber one, the United States is Lesterland.
p48
aVThe United States is Lesterland.
p49
aVThe United States also looks like this, also has two elections,
p50
aVone we called the general election,
p51
aVthe second we should call the money election.
p52
aVIn the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,
p53
aVif you're over 18, in some states if you have an ID.
p54
aVIn the money election, it's the funders who get to vote,
p55
aVthe funders who get to vote, and just like in Lesterland,
p56
aVthe trick is, to run in the general election,
p57
aVyou must do extremely well in the money election.
p58
aVYou don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown.
p59
aVBut you must do extremely well.
p60
aVAnd here's the key: There are just as few relevant funders
p61
aVin USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow you say, really?
p64
aVReally .05 percent?
p65
aVWell, here are the numbers from 2010:
p66
aV.26 percent of America
p67
aVgave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate,
p68
aV.05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate,
p69
aV.01 percent \u2014 the one percent of the one percent \u2014
p70
aVgave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates,
p71
aVand in this election cycle, my favorite statistic
p72
aVis .000042 percent
p73
aV\u2014 for those of you doing the numbers, you know that's 132 Americans \u2014
p74
aVgave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent
p75
aVin the cycle we have just seen ending.
p76
aVSo I'm just a lawyer, I look at this range of numbers,
p77
aVand I say it's fair for me to say
p78
aVit's .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America.
p79
aVIn this sense, the funders are our Lesters.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, what can we say about this democracy in USA-land?
p82
aVWell, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,
p83
aVwe could say, of course the people have the ultimate influence
p84
aVover the elected officials. We have a general election,
p85
aVbut only after the funders have had their way
p86
aVwith the candidates who wish to run in that general election.
p87
aVAnd number two, obviously,
p88
aVthis dependence upon the funders
p89
aVproduces a subtle, understated, camouflaged bending
p90
aVto keep the funders happy.
p91
aVCandidates for Congress and members of Congress
p92
aVspend between 30 and 70 percent of their time
p93
aVraising money to get back to Congress
p94
aVor to get their party back into power,
p95
aVand the question we need to ask is, what does it do to them,
p96
aVthese humans, as they spend their time
p97
aVbehind the telephone, calling people they've never met,
p98
aVbut calling the tiniest slice of the one percent?
p99
aVAs anyone would, as they do this,
p100
aVthey develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness
p101
aVabout how what they do might affect their ability to raise money.
p102
aVThey become, in the words of "The X-Files,"
p103
aVshape-shifters, as they constantly adjust their views
p104
aVin light of what they know will help them to raise money,
p105
aVnot on issues one to 10,
p106
aVbut on issues 11 to 1,000.
p107
aVLeslie Byrne, a Democrat from Virginia,
p108
aVdescribes that when she went to Congress,
p109
aVshe was told by a colleague, "Always lean to the green."
p110
aVThen to clarify, she went on,
p111
aV"He was not an environmentalist." (Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VSo here too we have a democracy,
p114
aVa democracy dependent upon the funders
p115
aVand dependent upon the people,
p116
aVcompeting dependencies,
p117
aVpossibly conflicting dependencies
p118
aVdepending upon who the funders are.
p119
aa(lp120
VOkay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one.
p121
aVHere's point number two.
p122
aVThe United States is worse than Lesterland,
p123
aVworse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland
p124
aVif we Lesters got a letter from the government that said,
p125
aV"Hey, you get to pick who gets to run in the general election,"
p126
aVwe would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters.
p127
aVYou know, there are Lesters from every part of social society.
p128
aVThere are rich Lesters, poor Lesters, black Lesters, white Lesters,
p129
aVnot many women Lesters, but put that to the side for one second.
p130
aVWe have Lesters from everywhere. We could think,
p131
aV"What could we do to make Lesterland better?"
p132
aVIt's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland.
p133
aVBut in our land, in this land, in USA-land,
p134
aVthere are certainly some sweet Lesters out there,
p135
aVmany of them in this room here today,
p136
aVbut the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters,
p137
aVbecause the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .05 percent
p138
aVare not comprising it for the public interest.
p139
aVIt's for their private interest. In this sense, the USA is worse than Lesterland.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd finally, point number three:
p142
aVWhatever one wants to say about Lesterland,
p143
aVagainst the background of its history, its traditions,
p144
aVin our land, in USA-land, Lesterland is a corruption,
p145
aVa corruption.
p146
aVNow, by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash
p147
aVsecreted among members of Congress.
p148
aVI don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption.
p149
aVI don't mean any criminal act.
p150
aVThe corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal.
p151
aVIt's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic.
p152
aVThe framers gave us what they called a republic,
p153
aVbut by a republic they meant a representative democracy,
p154
aVand by a representative democracy, they meant a government,
p155
aVas Madison put it in Federalist 52, that would have a branch
p156
aVthat would be dependent upon the people alone.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo here's the model of government.
p159
aVThey have the people and the government
p160
aVwith this exclusive dependency,
p161
aVbut the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence,
p162
aVno longer a dependence upon the people alone,
p163
aVincreasingly a dependence upon the funders.
p164
aVNow this is a dependence too,
p165
aVbut it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone
p166
aVso long as the funders are not the people.
p167
aVThis is a corruption.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, there's good news and bad news about this corruption.
p170
aVOne bit of good news is that it's bipartisan,
p171
aVequal-opportunity corruption.
p172
aVIt blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about.
p173
aVIt blocks the right too, as it makes
p174
aVprincipled arguments of the right increasingly impossible.
p175
aVSo the right wants smaller government.
p176
aVWhen Al Gore was Vice President, his team had an idea
p177
aVfor deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry.
p178
aVThe chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill,
p179
aVand as he reported back to me,
p180
aVthe response was, "Hell no!
p181
aVIf we deregulate these guys,
p182
aVhow are we going to raise money from them?"
p183
aa(lp184
VThis is a system that's designed to save the status quo,
p185
aVincluding the status quo of big and invasive government.
p186
aVIt works against the left and the right,
p187
aVand that, you might say, is good news.
p188
aa(lp189
VBut here's the bad news.
p190
aVIt's a pathological, democracy-destroying corruption,
p191
aVbecause in any system
p192
aVwhere the members are dependent upon
p193
aVthe tiniest fraction of us for their election,
p194
aVthat means the tiniest number of us,
p195
aVthe tiniest, tiniest number of us,
p196
aVcan block reform.
p197
aVI know that should have been, like, a rock or something.
p198
aVI can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is.
p199
aVBlock reform.
p200
aa(lp201
VBecause there is an economy here, an economy of influence,
p202
aVan economy with lobbyists at the center
p203
aVwhich feeds on polarization.
p204
aVIt feeds on dysfunction.
p205
aVThe worse that it is for us,
p206
aVthe better that it is for this fundraising.
p207
aa(lp208
VHenry David Thoreau: "There are a thousand hacking
p209
aVat the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."
p210
aVThis is the root.
p211
aa(lp212
VOkay, now, every single one of you knows this.
p213
aVYou couldn't be here if you didn't know this, yet you ignore it.
p214
aVYou ignore it. This is an impossible problem.
p215
aVYou focus on the possible problems,
p216
aVlike eradicating polio from the world,
p217
aVor taking an image of every single street across the globe,
p218
aVor building the first real universal translator,
p219
aVor building a fusion factory in your garage.
p220
aVThese are the manageable problems, so you ignore \u2014
p221
aV(Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p222
aVso you ignore this corruption.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut we cannot ignore this corruption anymore.
p225
aV(Applause)
p226
aVWe need a government that works.
p227
aVAnd not works for the left or the right,
p228
aVbut works for the left and the right,
p229
aVthe citizens of the left and right,
p230
aVbecause there is no sensible reform possible
p231
aVuntil we end this corruption.
p232
aVSo I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.
p233
aVClimate change is mine, but it might be financial reform
p234
aVor a simpler tax system or inequality.
p235
aVGrab that issue, sit it down in front of you,
p236
aVlook straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.
p237
aVThere will never be a Christmas.
p238
aVWe will never get your issue solved
p239
aVuntil we fix this issue first.
p240
aVSo it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not.
p241
aVYours is the most important issue, but mine is the first issue,
p242
aVthe issue we have to solve before we get to fix
p243
aVthe issues you care about.
p244
aVNo sensible reform, and we cannot afford
p245
aVa world, a future, with no sensible reform.
p246
aa(lp247
VOkay. So how do we do it?
p248
aVTurns out, the analytics here are easy, simple.
p249
aVIf the problem is members spending an extraordinary
p250
aVamount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America,
p251
aVthe solution is to have them spend less time fundraising
p252
aVbut fundraise from a wider slice of Americans,
p253
aVto spread it out,
p254
aVto spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea
p255
aVof dependence upon the people alone.
p256
aVAnd to do this does not require a constitutional amendment,
p257
aVchanging the First Amendment.
p258
aVTo do this would require a single statute,
p259
aVa statute establishing what we think of
p260
aVas small dollar funded elections,
p261
aVa statute of citizen-funded campaigns,
p262
aVand there's any number of these proposals out there:
p263
aVFair Elections Now Act,
p264
aVthe American Anti-Corruption Act,
p265
aVan idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project
p266
aVto give vouchers to people to fund elections,
p267
aVan idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act.
p268
aVEach of these would fix this corruption
p269
aVby spreading out the influence of funders to all of us.
p270
aa(lp271
VThe analytics are easy here.
p272
aVIt's the politics that's hard, indeed impossibly hard,
p273
aVbecause this reform would shrink K Street,
p274
aVand Capitol Hill, as Congressman Jim Cooper,
p275
aVa Democrat from Tennessee, put it,
p276
aVhas become a farm league for K Street, a farm league for K Street.
p277
aVMembers and staffers and bureaucrats have
p278
aVan increasingly common business model in their head,
p279
aVa business model focused on their life after government,
p280
aVtheir life as lobbyists.
p281
aVFifty percent of the Senate between 1998 and 2004
p282
aVleft to become lobbyists, 42 percent of the House.
p283
aVThose numbers have only gone up,
p284
aVand as United Republic calculated last April,
p285
aVthe average increase in salary for those who they tracked
p286
aVwas 1,452 percent.
p287
aVSo it's fair to ask, how is it possible for them to change this?
p288
aVNow I get this skepticism.
p289
aa(lp290
VI get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility.
p291
aVBut I don't buy it.
p292
aVThis is a solvable issue.
p293
aVIf you think about the issues our parents tried to solve
p294
aVin the 20th century,
p295
aVissues like racism, or sexism,
p296
aVor the issue that we've been fighting in this century, homophobia,
p297
aVthose are hard issues.
p298
aVYou don't wake up one day no longer a racist.
p299
aVIt takes generations to tear that intuition, that DNA,
p300
aVout of the soul of a people.
p301
aVBut this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives.
p302
aVChange the incentives, and the behavior changes,
p303
aVand the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems
p304
aVhave seen overnight a change in the practice.
p305
aVWhen Connecticut adopted this system,
p306
aVin the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives
p307
aVgave up large contributions and took small contributions only.
p308
aVIt's solvable,
p309
aVnot by being a Democrat,
p310
aVnot by being a Republican.
p311
aVIt's solvable by being citizens, by being citizens,
p312
aVby being TEDizens.
p313
aVBecause if you want to kickstart reform,
p314
aVlook, I could kickstart reform
p315
aVat half the price of fixing energy policy,
p316
aVI could give you back a republic.
p317
aa(lp318
VOkay. But even if you're not yet with me,
p319
aVeven if you believe this is impossible,
p320
aVwhat the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me
p321
aVas I've spoken about this issue again and again is,
p322
aVeven if you think it's impossible, that is irrelevant.
p323
aVIrrelevant.
p324
aVI spoke at Dartmouth once, and a woman stood up after I spoke,
p325
aVI write in my book, and she said to me,
p326
aV"Professor, you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless.
p327
aVThere's nothing we can do."
p328
aVWhen she said that, I scrambled.
p329
aVI tried to think, "How do I respond to that hopelessness?
p330
aVWhat is that sense of hopelessness?"
p331
aVAnd what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son.
p332
aVAnd I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying,
p333
aV"Your son has terminal brain cancer, and there's nothing you can do.
p334
aVNothing you can do."
p335
aVSo would I do nothing?
p336
aVWould I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do?
p337
aVI'm going off to build Google Glass.
p338
aVOf course not. I would do everything I could,
p339
aVand I would do everything I could because this is what love means,
p340
aVthat the odds are irrelevant and that you do
p341
aVwhatever the hell you can, the odds be damned.
p342
aVAnd then I saw the obvious link, because even we liberals
p343
aVlove this country.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd so when the pundits and the politicians
p348
aVsay that change is impossible,
p349
aVwhat this love of country says back is,
p350
aV"That's just irrelevant."
p351
aVWe lose something dear,
p352
aVsomething everyone in this room loves and cherishes,
p353
aVif we lose this republic, and so we act
p354
aVwith everything we can to prove these pundits wrong.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo here's my question:
p357
aVDo you have that love?
p358
aVDo you have that love?
p359
aVBecause if you do,
p360
aVthen what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing?
p361
aa(lp362
VWhen Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention
p363
aVin September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said,
p364
aV"Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?"
p365
aVFranklin said, "A republic, madam, if you can keep it."
p366
aVA republic. A representative democracy.
p367
aVA government dependent upon the people alone.
p368
aVWe have lost that republic.
p369
aVAll of us have to act to get it back.
p370
aa(lp371
VThank you very much.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Applause)
p374
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

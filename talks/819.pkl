VIt's not about technology,
p5
aVit's about people and stories.
p6
aVI could show you
p7
aVwhat recently was on television
p8
aVas a high quality video:
p9
aV60 Minutes, many of you may have seen it.
p10
aVAnd it was the now director of the entire piece
p11
aVof the veteran's administration \u2014
p12
aVwho, himself, had lost an arm 39 years ago
p13
aVin Vietnam \u2014
p14
aVwho was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices
p15
aVthat don't work.
p16
aVAnd it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background,
p17
aVafter he pretty much made his position clear on this \u2014
p18
aVhe had his hook and he had his \u2014
p19
aVhe wore this arm for less than two hours
p20
aVand was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact
p21
aVthat, quote \u2014 his quote \u2014
p22
aVit's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in 39 years.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story,
p25
aVand I'm not going to show you that polished video.
p26
aVI'm going to, instead, in a minute or two,
p27
aVshow you an early, crude video
p28
aVbecause I think it's
p29
aVa better way to tell a story.
p30
aa(lp31
VA few years ago I was visited by
p32
aVthe guy that runs DARPA,
p33
aVthe people that fund all the advanced technologies
p34
aVthat businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing.
p35
aVThey have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.
p36
aVI get this sort of unrequested \u2014 by me anyway \u2014 visit,
p37
aVand sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon
p38
aVfrom the military
p39
aVand the guy that runs DARPA.
p40
aa(lp41
VThey proceed to tell me a story which comes down
p42
aVto basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies
p43
aVnow and made them available
p44
aVin the most remote places that we put soldiers:
p45
aVhills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...
p46
aVThey were quite proud of the fact that
p47
aVyou know, before the dust clears,
p48
aVif some soldier has been hurt
p49
aVthey will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,
p50
aVthey will be getting world-class triage emergency care
p51
aVfaster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt
p52
aVin a car accident in a major city in the United States.
p53
aVThat's the good news.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe bad news is if they've collected this person
p56
aVand he or she is missing an arm or leg,
p57
aVpart of the face, it's probably not coming back.
p58
aVSo, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm.
p59
aVAnd then the surgeon pointed out, with a lot of anger,
p60
aVhe said, "Why is it? At the end of the Civil War,
p61
aVthey were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm,
p62
aVwe gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it.
p63
aVNow we've got F18s and F22s,
p64
aVand if somebody loses an arm,
p65
aVwe give them a plastic stick with a hook on it."
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd they basically said, "This is unacceptable,"
p68
aVand then the punchline: "So, Dean,
p69
aVwe're here because you make medical stuff.
p70
aVYou're going to give us an arm."
p71
aVAnd I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,
p72
aVpaperwork and DODs.
p73
aVNo, the guy says,
p74
aV"We're going to bring a guy into this conference room,
p75
aVand wearing the arm you're going to give us,
p76
aVhe or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape
p77
aVoff this table.
p78
aVIf it's the grape, they won't break it."
p79
aVGreat he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.
p80
aV"If it's the raisin, they won't drop it."
p81
aVSo he wants fine motor control: flex at the wrist,
p82
aVflex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder.
p83
aVEither way they were going to eat it.
p84
aa(lp85
V"Oh, by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame \u2014
p86
aVnamely 32 inches from the long finger \u2014
p87
aVand weigh less than nine pounds."
p88
aV50th percentile female frame.
p89
aV"And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power."
p90
aVSo, they finished that. And I, as you can tell,
p91
aVam a bashful guy.
p92
aVI told them they're nuts.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVThey've been watching too much "Terminator."
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVThen, the surgeon says to me,
p97
aV"Dean, you need to know
p98
aVmore than two dozen of these kids have come back
p99
aVbilateral."
p100
aVNow, I cannot imagine \u2014
p101
aVI'm sorry, you may have a better
p102
aVimagination than I do \u2014
p103
aVI can't imagine losing my arm,
p104
aVand typically at 22 years old.
p105
aVBut compared to that, losing two?
p106
aVSeems like that would be an inconvenience.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnyway, I went home that night. I thought about it.
p109
aVI literally could not sleep
p110
aVthinking about, "I wonder how you'd roll over
p111
aVwith no shoulders."
p112
aVSo, I decided we've got to do this.
p113
aVAnd trust me, I've got a day job, I've got a lot of day jobs.
p114
aVMost of my day job keeps me busy
p115
aVfunding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ....
p116
aVAnd I've got a lot of day jobs.
p117
aVBut I figured I gotta do this.
p118
aVDid a little investigation,
p119
aVwent down to Washington, told them
p120
aVI still think they're nuts but we're going to do it.
p121
aVAnd I told them I'd build them an arm.
p122
aVI told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA,
p123
aVand probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.
p124
aVLook what it takes to make things like iPods.
p125
aV"Great," he said, "You got two years."
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aVI said, "I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm
p128
aVthat's under nine pounds
p129
aVthat has all that capability in one year.
p130
aVIt will take the other nine to make it functional and useful."
p131
aVWe sort of agreed to disagree.
p132
aa(lp133
VI went back and I started putting a team together,
p134
aVthe best guys I could find with a passion to do this.
p135
aVAt the end of exactly one year
p136
aVwe had a device with 14 degrees of freedom,
p137
aVall the sensors, all the microprocessors,
p138
aVall the stuff inside.
p139
aVI could show you it with a cosmesis on it
p140
aVthat's so real it's eerie, but then you wouldn't see
p141
aVall this cool stuff.
p142
aVI then thought it would be years
p143
aVbefore we'd be able to make it really, really useful.
p144
aVIt turned out, as I think you could see
p145
aVin Aimee's capabilities and attitudes,
p146
aVpeople with a desire to do something
p147
aVare quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnyway, with less than 10 hours of use,
p150
aVtwo guys \u2014 one that's bilateral.
p151
aVHe's literally, he's got no shoulder on one side,
p152
aVand he's high trans-humeral on the other.
p153
aVAnd that's Chuck and Randy together,
p154
aVafter 10 hours \u2014 were playing in our office.
p155
aVAnd we took some pretty cruddy home movies.
p156
aVAt the end of the one I'm going to show, it's only about a minute
p157
aVand a couple of seconds long,
p158
aVChuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of,
p159
aVI can't do it.
p160
aVHe picks up a spoon, picks it up,
p161
aVscoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk,
p162
aVholds the spoon level
p163
aVas he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously,
p164
aVto his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk.
p165
aV(Laughter)
p166
aVI cannot do that.
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aVHis wife was standing behind me.
p169
aVShe's standing behind me at the time
p170
aVand she says, "Dean,
p171
aVChuck hasn't fed himself in 19 years.
p172
aVSo, you've got a choice:
p173
aVWe keep the arm, or you keep Chuck."
p174
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VSo, can we see that?
p177
aVThis is Chuck showing simultaneous control
p178
aVof all the joints.
p179
aVHe's punching our controls guy. The guy behind him
p180
aVis our engineer/surgeon,
p181
aVwhich is a convenient guy to have around.
p182
aVThere's Randy, these guys are passing a rubber
p183
aVlittle puck between them.
p184
aVAnd just as in the spirit of FIRST,
p185
aVgracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this,
p186
aVso they decide to share a drink.
p187
aVThis is a non-trivial thing to do, by the way.
p188
aVImagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it,
p189
aVdoing either of those.
p190
aVNow Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary,
p191
aVat least for my limited physical skill.
p192
aVAnd now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for.
p193
aVHe's going to pick up a grape \u2014 he didn't drop it,
p194
aVhe didn't break it \u2014
p195
aVand he's going to eat it.
p196
aVSo, that's where we were
p197
aVat the end of about 15 months.
p198
aV(Applause)
p199
aa(lp200
VBut, as I've learned from Richard,
p201
aVthe technology, the processors, the sensors, the motors,
p202
aVis not the story.
p203
aVI hadn't dealt with this kind of problem
p204
aVor frankly, this whole segment
p205
aVof the medical world.
p206
aVI'll give you some astounding things that have happened
p207
aVas we started this.
p208
aVAfter we were pretty much convinced we had a good design,
p209
aVand we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make \u2014
p210
aVyou can always get three out of four of anything you want;
p211
aVthe weight, the size, the cost, the functionality \u2014
p212
aVI put a bunch of guys in my plane
p213
aVand I said, "We're flying down to Walter Reed, and we're going talk to these kids,
p214
aVbecause frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm.
p215
aVIt doesn't matter whether the
p216
aVDepartment of Defense likes this arm."
p217
aVWhen I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic,
p218
aVbut I told them, "It really doesn't matter what their opinion is.
p219
aVThere is only one opinion that matters,
p220
aVthe kids that are either going to use it or not."
p221
aa(lp222
VI told a bunch of my engineers, "Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed,
p223
aVand you're going to see people, lots of them,
p224
aVmissing major body parts.
p225
aVThey're probably going to be angry, depressed, frustrated.
p226
aVWe're probably going to have to give them support, encouragement.
p227
aVBut we've got to extract from them
p228
aVenough information to make sure we're doing the right thing."
p229
aVWe walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong.
p230
aVWe did see a bunch of people,
p231
aVa lot of them missing a lot of body parts,
p232
aVand parts they had left were burned;
p233
aVhalf a face gone, an ear burned off.
p234
aa(lp235
VThey were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us.
p236
aVAnd we started asking them all questions.
p237
aV"Look," I'd say to them, "We're not quite as good as nature yet.
p238
aVI could give you fine motor control,
p239
aVor I could let you curl 40 pounds;
p240
aVI probably can't do both.
p241
aVI can give you fast control
p242
aVwith low reduction ratios in these gears,
p243
aVor I can give you power;
p244
aVI can't give you both.
p245
aVAnd we were trying to get them to all help us
p246
aVknow what to give them.
p247
aVNot only were they enthusiastic, they kept thinking
p248
aVthey're there to help us.
p249
aV"Well, would it help if I ..."
p250
aV"Guys, and woman,
p251
aVyou've given enough.
p252
aVWe're here to help you. We need data. We need to know
p253
aVwhat you need."
p254
aa(lp255
VAfter a half an hour, maybe, there was one guy at the far end of the table
p256
aVwho wasn't saying much.
p257
aVYou could see he was missing an arm.
p258
aVHe was leaning on his other arm.
p259
aVI called down to the end, "Hey, you haven't said much.
p260
aVIf we needed this or this, what would you want?"
p261
aVAnd he said, "You know,
p262
aVI'm the lucky guy at this table.
p263
aVI lost my right arm,
p264
aVbut I'm a lefty."
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aVSo, he wouldn't say much.
p267
aVHe had a great spirit, like all the rest of them had great spirits.
p268
aVAnd he made a few comments.
p269
aVAnd then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys.
p270
aVAnd that guy pushed himself back from the table ...
p271
aVhe has no legs.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo, we left.
p274
aVAnd I was thinking,
p275
aV"We didn't give them support and encouragement;
p276
aVthey gave it to us.
p277
aVThey're not finished giving yet."
p278
aVIt was astounding.
p279
aVSo, we went back.
p280
aVAnd I started working harder, faster.
p281
aVThen we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center.
p282
aVAnd we saw lots of these kids, lots of them.
p283
aVAnd it was astounding
p284
aVhow positive they are.
p285
aVSo, we went back,
p286
aVand we've been working harder yet.
p287
aVWe're in clinical trials,
p288
aVwe've got five of them on people.
p289
aVWe're screaming along.
p290
aVAnd I get a call and we go back
p291
aVto Washington.
p292
aa(lp293
VWe go back to Walter Reed,
p294
aVand a kid, literally,
p295
aV20 some-odd days before that
p296
aVwas blown up.
p297
aVAnd they shipped him to Germany
p298
aVand 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany
p299
aVto Walter Reed.
p300
aVAnd he was there,
p301
aVand they said we needed to come.
p302
aVAnd I went down
p303
aVand they rolled him into a room.
p304
aVHe's got no legs.
p305
aVHe's got no arms.
p306
aVHe's got a small residual limb on one side.
p307
aVHalf of his face is gone,
p308
aVbut they said his vision is coming back.
p309
aVHe had one good eye.
p310
aVHis name is Brandon Marrocco.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd he said,
p313
aV"I need your arms,
p314
aVbut I need two of them."
p315
aV"You'll get them."
p316
aVThis kid was from Staten Island.
p317
aVAnd he said, "I had a truck,
p318
aVbefore I went over there,
p319
aVand it had a stick.
p320
aVYou think I'll be able to drive it?"
p321
aV"Sure."
p322
aVAnd I turned around and went, "How are we going to do this?"
p323
aV(Laughter)
p324
aVAnyway, he was just like all the rest of them.
p325
aVHe doesn't really want a lot.
p326
aVHe wants to help. He told me that
p327
aVhe wanted to go back
p328
aVto help his buddies.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo, I was on my way out here.
p331
aVI was asked to stop at Texas.
p332
aVThere were 3,500 people,
p333
aVthe Veteran's Administration,
p334
aVU.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event
p335
aVto help the families
p336
aVof all the kids \u2014
p337
aVsome that have died, some that are
p338
aVlike Brandon \u2014
p339
aVand they wanted me to speak.
p340
aVI said, "What am I going to say?
p341
aVThis is not a happy thing. Look, if this happens to you,
p342
aVI can give you ... This stuff is
p343
aVstill not as good at the original equipment."
p344
aV"You need to come."
p345
aa(lp346
VSo, I went.
p347
aVAnd, as I think you get the point,
p348
aVthere were a lot people there recovering.
p349
aVSome further along than others.
p350
aVBut universally, these people that had been through this
p351
aVhad astounding attitudes,
p352
aVand just the fact that people care
p353
aVmakes a huge difference to them.
p354
aa(lp355
VI'll shut up, except one message
p356
aVor concern I have.
p357
aVI don't think anybody does it intentionally,
p358
aVbut there were people there literally talking about,
p359
aV"Well, how much will they get?"
p360
aVYou know, this country is involved as we've all heard,
p361
aVin this great healthcare debate.
p362
aV"Who is entitled to what?
p363
aVWho is entitled to how much?
p364
aVWho is going to pay for it?"
p365
aVThose are tough questions.
p366
aVI don't have an answer to that. Not everybody
p367
aVcan be entitled to everything simply because you were born here.
p368
aVIt's not possible. It would be nice
p369
aVbut let's be realistic.
p370
aa(lp371
VThey were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there.
p372
aVI don't know the answers.
p373
aVThere are other questions that are tough.
p374
aV"Should we be there?
p375
aVHow do we get out?
p376
aVWhat do we need to do?" There's very polarized
p377
aVanswers to that question too,
p378
aVand I don't have any answers to that.
p379
aVThose are political questions, economic questions,
p380
aVstrategic questions.
p381
aVI don't have the answer. But let me give you a simple
p382
aVconcern or maybe statement, then.
p383
aVIt is an easy answer.
p384
aa(lp385
VI know what these kids deserve
p386
aVon the healthcare side.
p387
aVI was talking to one of them,
p388
aVand he was really liking this arm \u2014
p389
aVit's way, way, way better than a plastic
p390
aVstick with a hook on it \u2014
p391
aVbut there's nobody in this room that would rather have that
p392
aVthan the one you got.
p393
aVBut I was saying to him, "You know,
p394
aVthe first airplane
p395
aVwent 100 feet in 1903.
p396
aVWilbur and Orville.
p397
aVBut you know what? It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous.
p398
aVBut now we got Eagles out there,
p399
aVF15s, even that Bald Eagle.
p400
aVI've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2.
p401
aVI think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary."
p402
aVAnd I said to that kid,
p403
aV"I'll stop when your buddies
p404
aVare envious of your Luke arm
p405
aVbecause of what it can do, and how it does it.
p406
aVAnd we'll keep working. And I'm not going to stop working
p407
aVuntil we do that."
p408
aa(lp409
VAnd I think this country
p410
aVought to continue its great debate,
p411
aVwhining and complaining, "I'm entitled." "You're a victim."
p412
aVAnd whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be.
p413
aVBut while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about
p414
aVwho's paying for what and how much we get,
p415
aVthe people that are out there
p416
aVgiving us that great privilege of whining and complaining,
p417
aVI know what they deserve:
p418
aVeverything humanly possible.
p419
aVAnd we ought to give it to them.

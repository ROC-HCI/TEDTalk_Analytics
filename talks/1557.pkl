VI want you to imagine this for a moment.
p5
aVTwo men, Rahul and Rajiv,
p6
aVliving in the same neighborhood,
p7
aVfrom the same educational background, similar occupation,
p8
aVand they both turn up at their local accident emergency
p9
aVcomplaining of acute chest pain.
p10
aVRahul is offered a cardiac procedure,
p11
aVbut Rajiv is sent home.
p12
aa(lp13
VWhat might explain the difference in the experience
p14
aVof these two nearly identical men?
p15
aVRajiv suffers from a mental illness.
p16
aVThe difference in the quality of medical care
p17
aVreceived by people with mental illness is one of the reasons
p18
aVwhy they live shorter lives
p19
aVthan people without mental illness.
p20
aVEven in the best-resourced countries in the world,
p21
aVthis life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years.
p22
aVIn the developing countries of the world, this gap
p23
aVis even larger.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut of course, mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways
p26
aVas well. The most obvious example is suicide.
p27
aVIt might surprise some of you here, as it did me,
p28
aVwhen I discovered that suicide is at the top of the list
p29
aVof the leading causes of death in young people
p30
aVin all countries in the world,
p31
aVincluding the poorest countries of the world.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut beyond the impact of a health condition
p34
aVon life expectancy, we're also concerned
p35
aVabout the quality of life lived.
p36
aVNow, in order for us to examine the overall impact
p37
aVof a health condition both on life expectancy
p38
aVas well as on the quality of life lived, we need to use
p39
aVa metric called the DALY,
p40
aVwhich stands for a Disability-Adjusted Life Year.
p41
aVNow when we do that, we discover some startling things
p42
aVabout mental illness from a global perspective.
p43
aVWe discover that, for example, mental illnesses are
p44
aVamongst the leading causes of disability around the world.
p45
aVDepression, for example, is the third-leading cause
p46
aVof disability, alongside conditions such as
p47
aVdiarrhea and pneumonia in children.
p48
aVWhen you put all the mental illnesses together,
p49
aVthey account for roughly 15 percent
p50
aVof the total global burden of disease.
p51
aVIndeed, mental illnesses are also very damaging
p52
aVto people's lives, but beyond just the burden of disease,
p53
aVlet us consider the absolute numbers.
p54
aVThe World Health Organization estimates
p55
aVthat there are nearly four to five hundred million people
p56
aVliving on our tiny planet
p57
aVwho are affected by a mental illness.
p58
aVNow some of you here
p59
aVlook a bit astonished by that number,
p60
aVbut consider for a moment the incredible diversity
p61
aVof mental illnesses, from autism and intellectual disability
p62
aVin childhood, through to depression and anxiety,
p63
aVsubstance misuse and psychosis in adulthood,
p64
aVall the way through to dementia in old age,
p65
aVand I'm pretty sure that each and every one us
p66
aVpresent here today can think of at least one person,
p67
aVat least one person, who's affected by mental illness
p68
aVin our most intimate social networks.
p69
aVI see some nodding heads there.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut beyond the staggering numbers,
p72
aVwhat's truly important from a global health point of view,
p73
aVwhat's truly worrying from a global health point of view,
p74
aVis that the vast majority of these affected individuals
p75
aVdo not receive the care
p76
aVthat we know can transform their lives, and remember,
p77
aVwe do have robust evidence that a range of interventions,
p78
aVmedicines, psychological interventions,
p79
aVand social interventions, can make a vast difference.
p80
aVAnd yet, even in the best-resourced countries,
p81
aVfor example here in Europe, roughly 50 percent
p82
aVof affected people don't receive these interventions.
p83
aVIn the sorts of countries I work in,
p84
aVthat so-called treatment gap
p85
aVapproaches an astonishing 90 percent.
p86
aVIt isn't surprising, then, that if you should speak
p87
aVto anyone affected by a mental illness,
p88
aVthe chances are that you will hear stories
p89
aVof hidden suffering, shame and discrimination
p90
aVin nearly every sector of their lives.
p91
aVBut perhaps most heartbreaking of all
p92
aVare the stories of the abuse
p93
aVof even the most basic human rights,
p94
aVsuch as the young woman shown in this image here
p95
aVthat are played out every day,
p96
aVsadly, even in the very institutions that were built to care
p97
aVfor people with mental illnesses, the mental hospitals.
p98
aa(lp99
VIt's this injustice that has really driven my mission
p100
aVto try to do a little bit to transform the lives
p101
aVof people affected by mental illness, and a particularly
p102
aVcritical action that I focused on is to bridge the gulf
p103
aVbetween the knowledge we have that can transform lives,
p104
aVthe knowledge of effective treatments, and how we actually
p105
aVuse that knowledge in the everyday world.
p106
aVAnd an especially important challenge that I've had to face
p107
aVis the great shortage of mental health professionals,
p108
aVsuch as psychiatrists and psychologists,
p109
aVparticularly in the developing world.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow I trained in medicine in India, and after that
p112
aVI chose psychiatry as my specialty, much to the dismay
p113
aVof my mother and all my family members who
p114
aVkind of thought neurosurgery would be
p115
aVa more respectable option for their brilliant son.
p116
aVAny case, I went on, I soldiered on with psychiatry,
p117
aVand found myself training in Britain in some of
p118
aVthe best hospitals in this country. I was very privileged.
p119
aVI worked in a team of incredibly talented, compassionate,
p120
aVbut most importantly, highly trained, specialized
p121
aVmental health professionals.
p122
aa(lp123
VSoon after my training, I found myself working
p124
aVfirst in Zimbabwe and then in India, and I was confronted
p125
aVby an altogether new reality.
p126
aVThis was a reality of a world in which there were almost no
p127
aVmental health professionals at all.
p128
aVIn Zimbabwe, for example, there were just about
p129
aVa dozen psychiatrists, most of whom lived and worked
p130
aVin Harare city, leaving only a couple
p131
aVto address the mental health care needs
p132
aVof nine million people living in the countryside.
p133
aa(lp134
VIn India, I found the situation was not a lot better.
p135
aVTo give you a perspective, if I had to translate
p136
aVthe proportion of psychiatrists in the population
p137
aVthat one might see in Britain to India,
p138
aVone might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in India.
p139
aVIn reality, take a guess.
p140
aVThe actual number is about 3,000,
p141
aVabout two percent of that number.
p142
aa(lp143
VIt became quickly apparent to me that I couldn't follow
p144
aVthe sorts of mental health care models that I had been trained in,
p145
aVone that relied heavily on specialized, expensive
p146
aVmental health professionals to provide mental health care
p147
aVin countries like India and Zimbabwe.
p148
aVI had to think out of the box about some other model
p149
aVof care.
p150
aa(lp151
VIt was then that I came across these books,
p152
aVand in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting
p153
aVin global health.
p154
aVThe idea is actually quite simple. The idea is,
p155
aVwhen you're short of specialized health care professionals,
p156
aVuse whoever is available in the community,
p157
aVtrain them to provide a range of health care interventions,
p158
aVand in these books I read inspiring examples,
p159
aVfor example of how ordinary people had been trained
p160
aVto deliver babies,
p161
aVdiagnose and treat early pneumonia, to great effect.
p162
aVAnd it struck me that if you could train ordinary people
p163
aVto deliver such complex health care interventions,
p164
aVthen perhaps they could also do the same
p165
aVwith mental health care.
p166
aa(lp167
VWell today, I'm very pleased to report to you
p168
aVthat there have been many experiments in task shifting
p169
aVin mental health care across the developing world
p170
aVover the past decade, and I want to share with you
p171
aVthe findings of three particular such experiments,
p172
aVall three of which focused on depression,
p173
aVthe most common of all mental illnesses.
p174
aVIn rural Uganda, Paul Bolton and his colleagues,
p175
aVusing villagers, demonstrated that they could deliver
p176
aVinterpersonal psychotherapy for depression
p177
aVand, using a randomized control design,
p178
aVshowed that 90 percent of the people receiving
p179
aVthis intervention recovered as compared
p180
aVto roughly 40 percent in the comparison villages.
p181
aVSimilarly, using a randomized control trial in rural Pakistan,
p182
aVAtif Rahman and his colleagues showed
p183
aVthat lady health visitors, who are community maternal
p184
aVhealth workers in Pakistan's health care system,
p185
aVcould deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers
p186
aVwho were depressed, again showing dramatic differences
p187
aVin the recovery rates. Roughly 75 percent of mothers
p188
aVrecovered as compared to about 45 percent
p189
aVin the comparison villages.
p190
aVAnd in my own trial in Goa, in India, we again showed
p191
aVthat lay counselors drawn from local communities
p192
aVcould be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions
p193
aVfor depression, anxiety, leading to 70 percent
p194
aVrecovery rates as compared to 50 percent
p195
aVin the comparison primary health centers.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, if I had to draw together all these different
p198
aVexperiments in task shifting, and there have of course
p199
aVbeen many other examples, and try and identify
p200
aVwhat are the key lessons we can learn that makes
p201
aVfor a successful task shifting operation,
p202
aVI have coined this particular acronym, SUNDAR.
p203
aVWhat SUNDAR stands for, in Hindi, is "attractive."
p204
aVIt seems to me that there are five key lessons
p205
aVthat I've shown on this slide that are critically important
p206
aVfor effective task shifting.
p207
aVThe first is that we need to simplify the message
p208
aVthat we're using, stripping away all the jargon
p209
aVthat medicine has invented around itself.
p210
aVWe need to unpack complex health care interventions
p211
aVinto smaller components that can be more easily
p212
aVtransferred to less-trained individuals.
p213
aVWe need to deliver health care, not in large institutions,
p214
aVbut close to people's homes, and we need to deliver
p215
aVhealth care using whoever is available and affordable
p216
aVin our local communities.
p217
aVAnd importantly, we need to reallocate the few specialists
p218
aVwho are available to perform roles
p219
aVsuch as capacity-building and supervision.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow for me, task shifting is an idea
p222
aVwith truly global significance,
p223
aVbecause even though it has arisen out of the
p224
aVsituation of the lack of resources that you find
p225
aVin developing countries, I think it has a lot of significance
p226
aVfor better-resourced countries as well. Why is that?
p227
aVWell, in part, because health care in the developed world,
p228
aVthe health care costs in the [developed] world,
p229
aVare rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk
p230
aVof those costs are human resource costs.
p231
aVBut equally important is because health care has become
p232
aVso incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote
p233
aVand removed from local communities.
p234
aVFor me, what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting,
p235
aVthough, isn't that it simply makes health care
p236
aVmore accessible and affordable but that
p237
aVit is also fundamentally empowering.
p238
aVIt empowers ordinary people to be more effective
p239
aVin caring for the health of others in their community,
p240
aVand in doing so, to become better guardians
p241
aVof their own health. Indeed, for me, task shifting
p242
aVis the ultimate example of the democratization
p243
aVof medical knowledge, and therefore, medical power.
p244
aa(lp245
VJust over 30 years ago, the nations of the world assembled
p246
aVat Alma-Ata and made this iconic declaration.
p247
aVWell, I think all of you can guess
p248
aVthat 12 years on, we're still nowhere near that goal.
p249
aVStill, today, armed with that knowledge
p250
aVthat ordinary people in the community
p251
aVcan be trained and, with sufficient supervision and support,
p252
aVcan deliver a range of health care interventions effectively,
p253
aVperhaps that promise is within reach now.
p254
aVIndeed, to implement the slogan of Health for All,
p255
aVwe will need to involve all
p256
aVin that particular journey,
p257
aVand in the case of mental health, in particular we would
p258
aVneed to involve people who are affected by mental illness
p259
aVand their caregivers.
p260
aa(lp261
VIt is for this reason that, some years ago,
p262
aVthe Movement for Global Mental Health was founded
p263
aVas a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals
p264
aVlike myself and people affected by mental illness
p265
aVcould stand together, shoulder-to-shoulder,
p266
aVand advocate for the rights of people with mental illness
p267
aVto receive the care that we know can transform their lives,
p268
aVand to live a life with dignity.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd in closing, when you have a moment of peace or quiet
p271
aVin these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards,
p272
aVspare a thought for that person you thought about
p273
aVwho has a mental illness, or persons that you thought about
p274
aVwho have mental illness,
p275
aVand dare to care for them. Thank you. (Applause)

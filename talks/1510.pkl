VSo let me start by taking you back,
p5
aVback into the mists of your memory
p6
aVto perhaps the most anticipated year in your life,
p7
aVbut certainly the most anticipated year
p8
aVin all human history:
p9
aVthe year 2000. Remember that?
p10
aVY2K, the dotcom bubble,
p11
aVstressing about whose party you're going to go to
p12
aVas the clock strikes midnight,
p13
aVbefore the champagne goes flat,
p14
aVand then there's that inchoate yearning
p15
aVthat was felt, I think, by many, that the millennium,
p16
aVthat the year 2000, should mean more,
p17
aVmore than just a two and some zeroes.
p18
aa(lp19
VWell, amazingly, for once, our world leaders
p20
aVactually lived up to that millennium moment
p21
aVand back in 2000 agreed to some
p22
aVpretty extraordinary stuff:
p23
aVvisionary, measurable, long-term targets
p24
aVcalled the Millennium Development Goals.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals
p27
aVunder your pillow, or by the bedside table,
p28
aVbut just in case you don't,
p29
aVand your memory needs some jogging,
p30
aVthe deal agreed then goes like this:
p31
aVdeveloping countries promised to at least halve
p32
aVextreme poverty, hunger and deaths from disease,
p33
aValongside some other targets, by 2015,
p34
aVand developed nations promised to help them
p35
aVget that done by dropping debts,
p36
aVincreasing smart aid, and trade reform.
p37
aa(lp38
VWell, we're approaching 2015,
p39
aVso we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals?
p40
aVBut we've also got to decide, do we like such global goals?
p41
aVSome people don't. And if we like them, we've got to decide
p42
aVwhat we want to do on these goals going forward.
p43
aVWhat does the world want to do together?
p44
aVWe've got to decide a process by which we decide.
p45
aa(lp46
VWell, I definitely think these goals are worth building on
p47
aVand seeing through, and here's just a few reasons why.
p48
aVIncredible partnerships between the private sector,
p49
aVpolitical leaders, philanthropists
p50
aVand amazing grassroots activists
p51
aVacross the developing world,
p52
aVbut also 250,000 people marched in the streets
p53
aVof Edinburgh outside this very building
p54
aVfor Make Poverty History.
p55
aa(lp56
VAll together, they achieved these results:
p57
aVincreased the number of people on anti-retrovirals,
p58
aVlife-saving anti-AIDS drugs;
p59
aVnearly halved deaths from malaria;
p60
aVvaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved.
p61
aVAnd combined, this is going to result
p62
aVin two million fewer children dying every year,
p63
aVlast year, than in the year 2000.
p64
aVThat's 5,000 fewer kids dying every day,
p65
aVten times you lot not dead every day,
p66
aVbecause of all of these partnerships.
p67
aVSo I think this is amazing living proof of progress
p68
aVthat more people should know about,
p69
aVbut the challenge of communicating this kind of good news
p70
aVis probably the subject of a different TEDTalk.
p71
aVAnyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results,
p72
aVthank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it.
p73
aa(lp74
VBut there's still a lot of unfinished business.
p75
aVStill, 7.6 million children die every year of preventable,
p76
aVtreatable diseases,
p77
aVand 178 million kids are malnourished
p78
aVto the point of stunting, a horrible term
p79
aVwhich means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment.
p80
aVSo there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut then, a lot of people think there are things
p83
aVthat should have been in the original package
p84
aVthat weren't agreed back then that should now be included,
p85
aVlike sustainable development targets,
p86
aVnatural resource governance targets,
p87
aVaccess to opportunity, to knowledge,
p88
aVequity, fighting corruption.
p89
aVAll of this is measurable and could be in the new goals.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut the key thing here is,
p92
aVwhat do you think should be in the new goals?
p93
aVWhat do you want?
p94
aVAre you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality
p95
aVor education?
p96
aVShould those be in the new package of goals?
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd quite frankly, that's a good question,
p99
aVbut there's going to be some tough tradeoffs
p100
aVand choices here, so you want to hope
p101
aVthat the process by which the world decides
p102
aVthese new goals is going to be legitimate, right?
p103
aa(lp104
VWell, as we gather here in Edinburgh,
p105
aVtechnocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments,
p106
aVwith the best intentions, are busying themselves
p107
aVdesigning a new package of goals,
p108
aVand currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old
p109
aVlate-20th-century, top-down, elite, closed process.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut, of course, since then, the Web and mobile telephony,
p112
aValong with ubiquitous reality TV formats
p113
aVhave spread all around the world.
p114
aVSo what we'd like to propose is that we use them
p115
aVto involve people from all around the world
p116
aVin an historic first: the world's first truly global
p117
aVpoll and consultation, where everyone everywhere
p118
aVhas an equal voice for the very first time.
p119
aa(lp120
VI mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity
p121
aVnot to do this, given that we can?
p122
aVThere's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake,
p123
aVtens of millions of lives, or deaths, at stake,
p124
aVand, I'd argue, the security and future
p125
aVof you and your family is also at stake.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo, if you're with me, I'd say there's three essential steps
p128
aVin this crowdsourcing campaign:
p129
aVcollecting, connecting and committing.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo first of all, we've got to ground this campaign
p132
aVin core polling data.
p133
aVLet's go into every country that will let us in,
p134
aVask 1,001 people what they want
p135
aVthe new goals to be, making special efforts
p136
aVto reach the poorest, those without access
p137
aVto modern technology, and let's make sure that their views
p138
aVare at the center of the goals going forward.
p139
aa(lp140
VThen, we've got to commission a baseline survey
p141
aVto make sure we can monitor and progress the goals
p142
aVgoing forward. The original goals didn't really have
p143
aVgood baseline survey data,
p144
aVand we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure
p145
aVwe can really monitor the progress.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd then we've got to connect with the big crowd.
p148
aVNow here, we see the role for an unprecedented coalition
p149
aVof social media giants and upstarts,
p150
aVtelecoms companies, reality TV show formats,
p151
aVgaming companies, telecoms, all of them together
p152
aVin kind of their "We Are The World" moment.
p153
aVCould they come together and help
p154
aVthe Millennium Development Goals get rebranded
p155
aVinto the Millennial Generation's Goals?
p156
aVAnd if just five percent of the five billion plus
p157
aVwho are currently connected made a comment,
p158
aVand that comment turned into a commitment,
p159
aVwe could crowdsource a force of 300 million people
p160
aVaround the world to help see these goals through.
p161
aa(lp162
VIf we have this collected data, and this connected crowd,
p163
aVbased upon our experience of campaigning
p164
aVand getting world leaders to commit,
p165
aVI think world leaders will commit
p166
aVto most of the crowdsourced recommendations.
p167
aa(lp168
VBut the question really is, through this process
p169
aVwill we all have become committed?
p170
aVAnd if we are, are we ready to iterate, monitor
p171
aVand provide feedback, make sure these promises
p172
aVare really delivering results?
p173
aa(lp174
VWell, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up,
p175
aVmostly piloted within Africa, actually.
p176
aVThere's Open Data Kenya, which geocodes
p177
aVand crowdsources information about where projects are,
p178
aVare they delivering results.
p179
aVOften, they're not in the right place.
p180
aVAnd Ushahidi, which means "witness" in Swahili,
p181
aVwhich geocodes and crowdsources information
p182
aVin complex emergencies to help target responses.
p183
aVThis is some of the most exciting stuff
p184
aVin development and democracy,
p185
aVwhere citizens on the edge of a network
p186
aVare helping to force open the process
p187
aVto make sure that the big global aid promises
p188
aVand vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people
p189
aVat a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid.
p190
aVThis openness, this forcing openness, is key,
p191
aVand if it wasn't entirely transparent already,
p192
aVI should be open: I've got a completely transparent agenda.
p193
aa(lp194
VLong-term trends suggest that this century
p195
aVis going to be a tough place to live,
p196
aVwith population increases, consumption patterns increasing,
p197
aVand conflict over scarce natural resources.
p198
aVAnd look at the state of global politics today.
p199
aVLook at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week,
p200
aVor the Mexican G20, also last week.
p201
aVBoth, if we're honest, a bust.
p202
aVOur world leaders, our global politics,
p203
aVcurrently can't get it done.
p204
aVThey need our help. They need the cavalry,
p205
aVand the cavalry's not going to come from Mars.
p206
aVIt's got to come from us, and I see this process
p207
aVof deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion
p208
aVwhat the world wants to work on together
p209
aVas one vital means by which we can crowdsource
p210
aVthe force to really build that constituency
p211
aVthat's going to reinvigorate global governance
p212
aVin the 21st century.
p213
aa(lp214
VI started in 2000. Let me finish in 2030.
p215
aa(lp216
VMany people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago
p217
aVwe had called Make Poverty History.
p218
aVIt was a naive thought in many people's minds,
p219
aVand it's true, it was just a t-shirt slogan
p220
aVthat worked for the moment. But look.
p221
aVThe empirical condition of living under a dollar and 25
p222
aVis trending down, and look where it gets to by 2030.
p223
aVIt's getting near zero.
p224
aVNow sure, progress in China and India
p225
aVand poverty reduction there was key to that,
p226
aVbut recently also in Africa, poverty rates are being reduced.
p227
aVIt will get harder as we get towards zero,
p228
aVas the poor will be increasingly located
p229
aVin post-conflict, fragile states,
p230
aVor maybe in middle income states
p231
aVwhere they don't really care about the marginalized.
p232
aVBut I'm confident, with the right kind of political campaigning
p233
aVand creative and technological innovation combined
p234
aVworking together more and more as one,
p235
aVI think we can get this and other goals done.
p236
aa(lp237
VThank you. (Applause)
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VChris Anderson: Jamie, here's the puzzle to me.
p242
aVIf there was an incident today where a hundred kids
p243
aVdied in some tragedy or where, say, a hundred kids
p244
aVwere kidnapped and then rescued by special forces,
p245
aVI mean, it would be all over the news for a week, right?
p246
aVYou just put up, just as one of your numbers there,
p247
aVthat 5,000 \u2014 is that the number?
p248
aa(lp249
VJamie Drummond: Fewer children every day.
p250
aa(lp251
VCA: Five thousand fewer children dying every day.
p252
aVI mean, it dwarfs, dwarfs everything
p253
aVthat is actually on our news agenda, and it's invisible.
p254
aVThis must drive you crazy.
p255
aa(lp256
VJD: It does, and we're having a huge debate in this country
p257
aVabout aid levels, for example, and aid alone is not
p258
aVthe whole solution. Nobody thinks it is.
p259
aVBut, you know, if people saw the results of this smart aid,
p260
aVI mean, they'd be going crazy for it.
p261
aVI wish the 250,000 people who really did march
p262
aVoutside this very building knew these results.
p263
aVRight now they don't, and it would be great to find a way
p264
aVto better communicate it, because we have not.
p265
aVCreatively, we've failed to communicate this success so far.
p266
aVIf those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice
p267
aVand amplify it at the key moments, I know for a fact
p268
aVwe'd get better policy.
p269
aVThe Mexican G20 need not have been a bust.
p270
aVRio, if anyone cares about the environment,
p271
aVneed not have been a bust, okay?
p272
aVBut these conferences are going on,
p273
aVand I know people get skeptical and cynical
p274
aVabout the big global summits and the promises
p275
aVand their never being kept, but actually,
p276
aVthe bits that are, are making a difference,
p277
aVand what the politicians need
p278
aVis more permission from the public.
p279
aa(lp280
VCA: But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms, etc.
p281
aVby which this might happen.
p282
aVI mean, if the people here who've had experience
p283
aVusing open platforms, you're interested to talk with them
p284
aVthis week and try to take this forward.
p285
aa(lp286
VJD: Absolutely. CA: All right, well I must say,
p287
aVif this conference led in some way
p288
aVto advancing that idea, that's a huge idea,
p289
aVand if you carry that forward, that is really awesome,
p290
aVso thank you. JD: I'd love your help.
p291
aa(lp292
VCA: Thank you, thank you.

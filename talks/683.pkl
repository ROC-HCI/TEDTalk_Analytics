VI started my journey 30 years ago.
p5
aVAnd I worked in mines. And I realized that
p6
aVthis was a world unseen.
p7
aVAnd I wanted, through color and large format cameras
p8
aVand very large prints,
p9
aVto make a body of work that somehow
p10
aVbecame symbols of our
p11
aVuse of the landscape,
p12
aVhow we use the land.
p13
aVAnd to me this was
p14
aVa key component that somehow, through this medium of photography,
p15
aVwhich allows us to contemplate these landscapes,
p16
aVthat I thought photography was perfectly suited
p17
aVto doing this type of work.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes,
p20
aVit occurred to me that
p21
aVoil is underpinning the scale and speed.
p22
aVBecause that is what has changed,
p23
aVis the speed at which we're taking all our resources.
p24
aVAnd so then I went out to develop a whole series
p25
aVon the landscape of oil.
p26
aVAnd what I want to do is to kind of map an arc
p27
aVthat there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground,
p28
aVrefinement. And that's one chapter.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe other chapter that I wanted to look at was
p31
aVhow we use it \u2014 our cities,
p32
aVour cars, our motorcultures,
p33
aVwhere people gather around the vehicle
p34
aVas a celebration.
p35
aVAnd then the third one is this idea of the end of oil,
p36
aVthis entropic end,
p37
aVwhere all of our parts of cars, our tires,
p38
aVoil filters,
p39
aVhelicopters, planes \u2014
p40
aVwhere are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up?
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd to me, again, photography was
p43
aVa way in which I could explore and research the world,
p44
aVand find those places.
p45
aVAnd another idea that I had as well,
p46
aVthat was brought forward by an ecologist \u2014
p47
aVhe basically did a calculation where
p48
aVhe took one liter of gas and said,
p49
aVwell, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material?
p50
aVIt was 23 metric tons for one liter.
p51
aVSo whenever I fill up my gas,
p52
aVI think of that liter, and how much carbon.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton,
p55
aVbut he did the calculations for our Earth
p56
aVand what it had to do to produce that amount of energy.
p57
aVFrom the photosynthetic growth,
p58
aVit would take 500 years of that growth
p59
aVto produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd that also brought me to the fact that
p62
aVthis poses such a risk to our society.
p63
aVLooking at 30 billion per year,
p64
aVwe look at our two largest suppliers,
p65
aVSaudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil.
p66
aVAnd together they only form about 15 years of supply.
p67
aVThe whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves,
p68
aVonly gives us about 45 years.
p69
aVSo, it's not a question of if, but a question of when
p70
aVpeak oil will come upon us.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo, to me, using photography \u2014
p73
aVand I feel that all of us need to now begin to really
p74
aVtake the task of using our talents,
p75
aVour ways of thinking,
p76
aVto begin to deal with what I think is probably
p77
aVone of the most challenging issues of our time,
p78
aVhow to deal with our energy crisis.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd I would like to say that, on the other side of it,
p81
aV30, 40 years from now, the children that I have,
p82
aVI can look at them and say, "We did everything
p83
aVwe possibly, humanly could do,
p84
aVto begin to mitigate this,
p85
aVwhat I feel is one of the most important and critical
p86
aVmoments in our time. Thank you.

Burtynsky&#39;s large-format color photographs explore the impact of humanity&#39;s expanding footprint and the substantial ways in which we&#39;re reshaping the surface of the planet.

Burtynsky&#39;s photographs are included in the collections of over 50 museums around the world, including the Tate, London and the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim in New York City. A large-format book, 2003&#39;s <a href=\\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300099436\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Manufactured Landscapes,</em></a> collected his work, and in 2007, a documentary based on his photography, also called <em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/manulandscapesdoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Manufactured Landscapes</a>,</em> debuted at the Toronto Film Festival before going on to screen at Sundance and elsewhere. It was released on DVD in March 2007. In 2008, after giving a talk at the&nbsp;Long Now Foundation, Burtynsky proposed &quot;The 10,000 Year Gallery,&quot; which could house art to be curated over thousands of years preserved through carbon transfers in an effort to reflect the attitudes and changes of the world over time.&nbsp;</p><p>When Burtynsky accepted his 2005 <a href=\\"/pages/view/id/6\\" target=\\"_blank\\">TED Prize</a>, he made three <a href=\\"/pages/view/id/109\\" target=\\"_blank\\">wishes</a>.

Thanks to WGBH and the TED community, the show and site <em><a href=\\"http://www.meetthegreens.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Meet the Greens</a></em> debuted at TED2007. His second wish: to begin work on an Imax film, which morphed into the jaw-dropping film <em>Manufactured Landscapes</em> with Jennifer Baichwal. And his third wish, wider in scope, was simply to encourage &quot;a massive and productive worldwide conversation about sustainable living.&quot; Thanks to his help and the input of the TED community, the site <a href=\\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006356.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" title=\\"WorldChanging.com\\">WorldChanging.com</a> got an infusion of energy that has helped it to grow into a leading voice in the sustainability community.</p><p>In 2016, he won a Governor General&#39;s Award in Visual and Media Arts for his work.</p>", "slug": "edward_burtynsky", "whotheyare": "2005 TED Prize winner Edward Burtynsky has made it his life\'s work to document humanity\'s impact on the planet.

of tires to rivers of bright orange waste from a nickel mine -- are eerily pretty yet ugly at the same time. Burtynsky&#39;s large-format color photographs explore the impact of humanity&#39;s expanding footprint and the substantial ways in which we&#39;re reshaping the surface of the planet. His images powerfully alter the way we think about the world and our place in it. </p><p>With his blessing and encouragement, <a href=\\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006356.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" title=\\"WorldChanging.com\\">WorldChanging.com</a>  and others use his work to inspire ongoing global conversations about sustainable living. Burtynsky&#39;s photographs are included in the collections of over 50 museums around the world, including the Tate, London and the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim in New York City. A large-format book, 2003&#39;s <a href=\\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300099436\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Manufactured Landscapes,</em></a> collected his work, and in 2007, a documentary based on his photography, also called <em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/manulandscapesdoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Manufactured Landscapes</a>,</em> debuted at the Toronto Film Festival before going on to screen at Sundance and elsewhere. It was released on DVD in March 2007. In 2008, after giving a talk at the&nbsp;Long Now Foundation, Burtynsky proposed &quot;The 10,000 Year Gallery,&quot; which could house art to be curated over thousands of years preserved through carbon transfers in an effort to reflect the attitudes and changes of the world over time.&nbsp;</p><p>When Burtynsky accepted his 2005 <a href=\\"/pages/view/id/6\\" target=\\"_blank\\">TED Prize</a>, he made three <a href=\\"/pages/view/id/109\\" target=\\"_blank\\">wishes</a>. One of his wishes: to build a website that will help kids think about going green. Thanks to WGBH and the TED community, the show and site <em><a href=\\"http://www.meetthegreens.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Meet the Greens</a></em> debuted at TED2007. His second wish: to begin work on an Imax film, which morphed into the jaw-dropping film <em>Manufactured Landscapes</em> with Jennifer Baichwal. And his third wish, wider in scope, was simply to encourage &quot;a massive and productive worldwide conversation about sustainable living.&quot; Thanks to his help and the input of the TED community, the site <a href=\\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006356.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" title=\\"WorldChanging.com\\">WorldChanging.com</a> got an infusion of energy that has helped it to grow into a leading voice in the sustainability community.</p><p>In 2016, he won a Governor General&#39;s Award in Visual and Media Arts for his work.</p>", "slug": "edward_burtynsky", "whotheyare": "2005 TED Prize winner Edward Burtynsky has made it his life\'s work to document humanity\'s impact on the planet.

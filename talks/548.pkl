VI'll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior.
p5
aVNot yours, of course \u2014 other people's.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VSo after being at MIT for a few years,
p10
aVI realized that writing academic papers is not that exciting.
p11
aVYou know, I don't know how many of those you read,
p12
aVbut it's not fun to read and often not fun to write \u2014
p13
aVeven worse to write.
p14
aVSo I decided to try and write something more fun.
p15
aVAnd I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook.
p16
aVAnd the title for my cookbook was going to be,
p17
aV"Dining Without Crumbs: The Art of Eating Over the Sink."
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen.
p22
aVI was quite excited about this.
p23
aVI was going to talk a little bit about research,
p24
aVa little bit about the kitchen.
p25
aVWe do so much in the kitchen, I thought this would be interesting.
p26
aVI wrote a couple of chapters, and took it to MIT Press and they said,
p27
aa(lp28
V"Cute, but not for us. Go and find somebody else."
p29
aa(lp30
VI tried other people, and everybody said the same thing,
p31
aa(lp32
V"Cute. Not for us."
p33
aa(lp34
VUntil somebody said,
p35
aV"Look, if you're serious about this,
p36
aVyou have to write about your research first; you have to publish something,
p37
aVthen you'll get the opportunity to write something else.
p38
aVIf you really want to do it, you have to do it."
p39
aa(lp40
VI said, "I don't want to write about my research.
p41
aVI do it all day long,
p42
aVI want to write something a bit more free, less constrained."
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd this person was very forceful and said,
p45
aV"Look, that's the only way you'll ever do it."
p46
aa(lp47
VSo I said, "Okay, if I have to do it \u2014"
p48
aVI had a sabbatical.
p49
aVI said, "I'll write about my research, if there's no other way.
p50
aVAnd then I'll get to do my cookbook."
p51
aVSo, I wrote a book on my research.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd it turned out to be quite fun in two ways.
p54
aVFirst of all, I enjoyed writing.
p55
aVBut the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people.
p56
aVIt's a fantastic time to write,
p57
aVbecause there's so much feedback you can get from people.
p58
aVPeople write to me about their personal experience,
p59
aVand about their examples, and where they disagree,
p60
aVand their nuances.
p61
aVAnd even being here \u2014 I mean, the last few days,
p62
aVI've known heights of obsessive behavior
p63
aVI never thought about.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VWhich I think is just fascinating.
p68
aa(lp69
VI will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior,
p70
aVand I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion
p71
aVas a metaphor for rationality.
p72
aVSo think about these two tables.
p73
aVAnd you must have seen this illusion.
p74
aVIf I asked you what's longer, the vertical line on the table on the left,
p75
aVor the horizontal line on the table on the right,
p76
aVwhich one seems longer?
p77
aVCan anybody see anything but the left one being longer?
p78
aVNo, right? It's impossible.
p79
aVBut the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes.
p80
aVSo I can put some lines on; it doesn't help.
p81
aVI can animate the lines.
p82
aVAnd to the extent you believe I didn't shrink the lines,
p83
aVwhich I didn't, I've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you.
p84
aVNow, the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away,
p85
aVit's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VYou can't look at this and say, "Now I see reality as it is."
p90
aVRight? It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer.
p91
aVOur intuition is really fooling us
p92
aVin a repeatable, predictable, consistent way.
p93
aVand there is almost nothing we can do about it,
p94
aVaside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it.
p95
aa(lp96
VHere's another one. It's one of my favorite illusions.
p97
aVWhat color is the top arrow pointing to?
p98
aa(lp99
VAudience: Brown. Dan Ariely: Brown. Thank you.
p100
aa(lp101
VThe bottom one? Yellow.
p102
aVTurns out they're identical.
p103
aVCan anybody see them as identical?
p104
aVVery, very hard.
p105
aVI can cover the rest of the cube up.
p106
aVIf I cover the rest of the cube, you can see that they are identical.
p107
aVIf you don't believe me, you can get the slide later
p108
aVand do some arts and crafts and see that they're identical.
p109
aVBut again, it's the same story, that if we take the background away,
p110
aVthe illusion comes back.
p111
aVThere is no way for us not to see this illusion.
p112
aVI guess maybe if you're colorblind, I don't think you can see that.
p113
aVI want you to think about illusion as a metaphor.
p114
aa(lp115
VVision is one of the best things we do.
p116
aVWe have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision \u2014
p117
aVbigger than dedicated to anything else.
p118
aVWe use our vision more hours of the day than anything else.
p119
aVWe're evolutionarily designed to use vision.
p120
aVAnd if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision,
p121
aVwhich we're so good at,
p122
aVwhat are the chances we won't make even more mistakes
p123
aVin something we're not as good at, for example, financial decision-making.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VSomething we don't have an evolutionary reason to do,
p128
aVwe don't have a specialized part of the brain for,
p129
aVand we don't do that many hours of the day.
p130
aVThe argument is in those cases,
p131
aVit might be that we actually make many more mistakes.
p132
aVAnd worse \u2014 not having an easy way to see them,
p133
aVbecause in visual illusions, we can easily demonstrate the mistakes;
p134
aVin cognitive illusion it's much, much harder
p135
aVto demonstrate the mistakes to people.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo I want to show you some cognitive illusions,
p138
aVor decision-making illusions, in the same way.
p139
aVAnd this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences.
p140
aVIt's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein.
p141
aVIt basically shows the percentage of people who indicated
p142
aVthey would be interested in donating their organs.
p143
aVThese are different countries in Europe.
p144
aVYou basically see two types of countries:
p145
aVcountries on the right, that seem to be giving a lot;
p146
aVand countries on the left that seem to giving very little,
p147
aVor much less.
p148
aVThe question is, why?
p149
aVWhy do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little?
p150
aa(lp151
VWhen you ask people this question,
p152
aVthey usually think that it has to be about culture.
p153
aVHow much do you care about people?
p154
aVGiving organs to somebody else
p155
aVis probably about how much you care about society, how linked you are.
p156
aVOr maybe it's about religion.
p157
aVBut if you look at this plot,
p158
aVyou can see that countries that we think about as very similar,
p159
aVactually exhibit very different behavior.
p160
aVFor example, Sweden is all the way on the right,
p161
aVand Denmark, which we think is culturally very similar,
p162
aVis all the way on the left.
p163
aVGermany is on the left, and Austria is on the right.
p164
aVThe Netherlands is on the left, and Belgium is on the right.
p165
aVAnd finally, depending on your particular version
p166
aVof European similarity,
p167
aVyou can think about the U.K. and France as either similar culturally or not,
p168
aVbut it turns out that with organ donation, they are very different.
p169
aa(lp170
VBy the way, the Netherlands is an interesting story.
p171
aVYou see, the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group.
p172
aVIt turns out that they got to 28 percent
p173
aVafter mailing every household in the country a letter,
p174
aVbegging people to join this organ donation program.
p175
aVYou know the expression, "Begging only gets you so far."
p176
aVIt's 28 percent in organ donation.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VBut whatever the countries on the right are doing,
p181
aVthey're doing a much better job than begging.
p182
aVSo what are they doing?
p183
aVTurns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV.
p184
aVAnd here is the story.
p185
aVThe countries on the left have a form at the DMV
p186
aVthat looks something like this.
p187
aV"Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program."
p188
aVAnd what happens?
p189
aVPeople don't check, and they don't join.
p190
aVThe countries on the right, the ones that give a lot,
p191
aVhave a slightly different form.
p192
aVIt says, "Check the box below if you don't want to participate ..."
p193
aVInterestingly enough, when people get this,
p194
aVthey again don't check, but now they join.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, think about what this means.
p199
aVYou know, we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions.
p200
aVWe wake up in the morning and we open the closet;
p201
aVwe feel that we decide what to wear.
p202
aVwe open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat.
p203
aVWhat this is actually saying,
p204
aVis that many of these decisions are not residing within us.
p205
aVThey are residing in the person who is designing that form.
p206
aVWhen you walk into the DMV,
p207
aVthe person who designed the form will have a huge influence
p208
aVon what you'll end up doing.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow, it's also very hard to intuit these results.
p211
aVThink about it for yourself.
p212
aVHow many of you believe
p213
aVthat if you went to renew your license tomorrow,
p214
aVand you went to the DMV,
p215
aVand you encountered one of these forms,
p216
aVthat it would actually change your own behavior?
p217
aVVery hard to think that it would influence us.
p218
aVWe can say, "Oh, these funny Europeans, of course it would influence them."
p219
aVBut when it comes to us,
p220
aVwe have such a feeling that we're in the driver's seat,
p221
aVsuch a feeling that we're in control and we are making the decision,
p222
aVthat it's very hard to even accept the idea
p223
aVthat we actually have an illusion of making a decision,
p224
aVrather than an actual decision.
p225
aa(lp226
VNow, you might say,
p227
aV"These are decisions we don't care about."
p228
aVIn fact, by definition, these are decisions
p229
aVabout something that will happen to us after we die.
p230
aVHow could we care about something less
p231
aVthan about something that happens after we die?
p232
aVSo a standard economist, somebody who believes in rationality,
p233
aVwould say, "You know what?
p234
aVThe cost of lifting the pencil and marking a "V" is higher
p235
aVthan the possible benefit of the decision,
p236
aVso that's why we get this effect."
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VBut, in fact, it's not because it's easy.
p241
aVIt's not because it's trivial. It's not because we don't care.
p242
aVIt's the opposite. It's because we care.
p243
aVIt's difficult and it's complex.
p244
aVAnd it's so complex that we don't know what to do.
p245
aVAnd because we have no idea what to do,
p246
aVwe just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us.
p247
aa(lp248
VI'll give you one more example.
p249
aVThis is from a paper by Redelmeier and Shafir.
p250
aVAnd they said, "Would this effect also happens to experts?
p251
aVPeople who are well-paid, experts in their decisions,
p252
aVand who make a lot of them?"
p253
aVAnd they took a group of physicians.
p254
aVThey presented to them a case study of a patient.
p255
aVThey said, "Here is a patient. He is a 67-year-old farmer.
p256
aVHe's been suffering from right hip pain for a while."
p257
aVAnd then, they said to the physicians,
p258
aV"You decided a few weeks ago
p259
aVthat nothing is working for this patient.
p260
aVAll these medications, nothing seems to be working.
p261
aVSo you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy.
p262
aVHip replacement. Okay?"
p263
aVSo the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced.
p264
aa(lp265
VThen they said to half of the physicians,
p266
aV"Yesterday, you reviewed the patient's case,
p267
aVand you realized that you forgot to try one medication.
p268
aVYou did not try ibuprofen.
p269
aVWhat do you do? Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen?
p270
aVOr do you let him go and have hip replacement?"
p271
aVWell, the good news is that most physicians in this case
p272
aVdecided to pull the patient and try ibuprofen.
p273
aVVery good for the physicians.
p274
aa(lp275
VTo the other group of physicians, they said,
p276
aV"Yesterday when you reviewed the case, you discovered there were two medications
p277
aVyou didn't try out yet \u2014 ibuprofen and piroxicam."
p278
aVYou have two medications you didn't try out yet.
p279
aVWhat do you do? You let him go, or you pull him back?
p280
aVAnd if you pull him back, do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam? Which one?"
p281
aVNow, think of it:
p282
aVThis decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement,
p283
aVbut pulling him back, all of the sudden it becomes more complex.
p284
aVThere is one more decision.
p285
aVWhat happens now?
p286
aVThe majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go
p287
aVfor a hip replacement.
p288
aVI hope this worries you, by the way \u2014
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
Vwhen you go to see your physician.
p293
aVThe thing is that no physician would ever say,
p294
aV"Piroxicam, ibuprofen, hip replacement. Let's go for hip replacement."
p295
aVBut the moment you set this as the default,
p296
aVit has a huge power over whatever people end up doing.
p297
aa(lp298
VI'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making.
p299
aVImagine I give you a choice:
p300
aVDo you want to go for a weekend to Rome, all expenses paid \u2014
p301
aVhotel, transportation, food, a continental breakfast, everything \u2014
p302
aVor a weekend in Paris?
p303
aVNow, weekend in Paris, weekend in Rome \u2014 these are different things.
p304
aVThey have different food, different culture, different art.
p305
aVImagine I added a choice to the set that nobody wanted.
p306
aVImagine I said, "A weekend in Rome,
p307
aVa weekend in Paris,
p308
aVor having your car stolen?"
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VIt's a funny idea, because why would having your car stolen,
p313
aVin this set, influence anything?
p314
aa(lp315
V(Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
VBut what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this?
p318
aVWhat if it was a trip to Rome, all expenses paid,
p319
aVtransportation, breakfast,
p320
aVbut it doesn't include coffee in the morning?
p321
aVIf you want coffee, you have to pay for it yourself, it's two euros 50.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VNow in some ways,
p326
aVgiven that you can have Rome with coffee,
p327
aVwhy would you possibly want Rome without coffee?
p328
aVIt's like having your car stolen. It's an inferior option.
p329
aVBut guess what happened?
p330
aVThe moment you add Rome without coffee,
p331
aVRome with coffee becomes more popular, and people choose it.
p332
aVThe fact that you have Rome without coffee
p333
aVmakes Rome with coffee look superior,
p334
aVand not just to Rome without coffee \u2014 even superior to Paris.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VHere are two examples of this principle.
p339
aVThis was an ad in The Economist a few years ago
p340
aVthat gave us three choices:
p341
aVan online subscription for 59 dollars,
p342
aVa print subscription for 125 dollars,
p343
aVor you could get both for 125.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VNow I looked at this, and I called up The Economist,
p348
aVand I tried to figure out what they were thinking.
p349
aVAnd they passed me from one person to another to another,
p350
aVuntil eventually I got to the person who was in charge of the website,
p351
aVand I called them up, and they went to check what was going on.
p352
aVThe next thing I know, the ad is gone, no explanation.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo I decided to do the experiment
p355
aVthat I would have loved The Economist to do with me.
p356
aVI took this and I gave it to 100 MIT students.
p357
aVI said, "What would you choose?"
p358
aVThese are the market shares \u2014 most people wanted the combo deal.
p359
aVThankfully, nobody wanted the dominant option.
p360
aVThat means our students can read.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VBut now, if you have an option that nobody wants,
p365
aVyou can take it off, right?
p366
aVSo I printed another version of this,
p367
aVwhere I eliminated the middle option.
p368
aVI gave it to another 100 students. Here is what happened:
p369
aVNow the most popular option became the least popular,
p370
aVand the least popular became the most popular.
p371
aa(lp372
VWhat was happening was the option that was useless,
p373
aVin the middle, was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it.
p374
aVBut it wasn't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out
p375
aVwhat they wanted.
p376
aVIn fact, relative to the option in the middle,
p377
aVwhich was get only the print for 125,
p378
aVthe print and web for 125 looked like a fantastic deal.
p379
aVAnd as a consequence, people chose it.
p380
aVThe general idea here, by the way,
p381
aVis that we actually don't know our preferences that well.
p382
aVAnd because we don't know our preferences that well,
p383
aVwe're susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces:
p384
aVthe defaults, the particular options that are presented to us, and so on.
p385
aa(lp386
VOne more example of this.
p387
aVPeople believe that when we deal with physical attraction,
p388
aVwe see somebody, and we know immediately whether we like them or not,
p389
aVif we're attracted or not.
p390
aVThis is why we have these four-minute dates.
p391
aVSo I decided to do this experiment with people.
p392
aVI'll show you images here, no real people, but the experiment was with people.
p393
aVI showed some people a picture of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.
p394
aVand I said, "Who do you want to date?
p395
aVTom or Jerry?"
p396
aVBut for half the people, I added an ugly version of Jerry.
p397
aVI took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive.
p398
aa(lp399
V(Laughter)
p400
aa(lp401
VFor the other people, I added an ugly version of Tom.
p402
aVAnd the question was, will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom
p403
aVhelp their respective, more attractive brothers?
p404
aVThe answer was absolutely yes.
p405
aVWhen ugly Jerry was around, Jerry was popular.
p406
aVWhen ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.
p407
aa(lp408
V(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
VThis of course has two very clear implications
p411
aVfor life in general.
p412
aVIf you ever go bar-hopping, who do you want to take with you?
p413
aa(lp414
V(Laughter)
p415
aa(lp416
VYou want a slightly uglier version of yourself.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Laughter)
p419
aa(lp420
VSimilar, but slightly uglier.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Laughter)
p423
aa(lp424
VThe second point, or course, is that if somebody invites you to bar hop,
p425
aVyou know what they think about you.
p426
aa(lp427
V(Laughter)
p428
aa(lp429
VNow you get it.
p430
aa(lp431
VWhat is the general point?
p432
aVThe general point is that,
p433
aVwhen we think about economics, we have this beautiful view of human nature.
p434
aV"What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason!"
p435
aVWe have this view of ourselves, of others.
p436
aVThe behavioral economics perspective is slightly less "generous" to people;
p437
aVin fact, in medical terms,
p438
aVthat's our view.
p439
aa(lp440
V(Laughter)
p441
aa(lp442
VBut there is a silver lining.
p443
aVThe silver lining is, I think,
p444
aVkind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting.
p445
aVAre we Superman, or are we Homer Simpson?
p446
aa(lp447
VWhen it comes to building the physical world,
p448
aVwe kind of understand our limitations.
p449
aVWe build steps.
p450
aVAnd we build these things that not everybody can use, obviously.
p451
aa(lp452
V(Laughter)
p453
aa(lp454
VWe understand our limitations,
p455
aVand we build around them.
p456
aVBut for some reason, when it comes to the mental world,
p457
aVwhen we design things like healthcare and retirement and stock markets,
p458
aVwe somehow forget the idea that we are limited.

VI'm here to talk about
p5
aVthe wonder and the mystery
p6
aVof conscious minds.
p7
aVThe wonder is about the fact
p8
aVthat we all woke up this morning
p9
aVand we had with it
p10
aVthe amazing return of our conscious mind.
p11
aVWe recovered minds with a complete sense of self
p12
aVand a complete sense of our own existence,
p13
aVyet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder.
p14
aVWe should, in fact,
p15
aVbecause without having this possibility of conscious minds,
p16
aVwe would have no knowledge whatsoever
p17
aVabout our humanity;
p18
aVwe would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world.
p19
aVWe would have no pains, but also no joys.
p20
aVWe would have no access to love
p21
aVor to the ability to create.
p22
aVAnd of course, Scott Fitzgerald said famously
p23
aVthat "he who invented consciousness
p24
aVwould have a lot to be blamed for."
p25
aVBut he also forgot
p26
aVthat without consciousness,
p27
aVhe would have no access to true happiness
p28
aVand even the possibility of transcendence.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo much for the wonder, now for the mystery.
p31
aVThis is a mystery
p32
aVthat has really been extremely hard to elucidate.
p33
aVAll the way back into early philosophy
p34
aVand certainly throughout the history of neuroscience,
p35
aVthis has been one mystery
p36
aVthat has always resisted elucidation,
p37
aVhas got major controversies.
p38
aVAnd there are actually many people
p39
aVthat think we should not even touch it;
p40
aVwe should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved.
p41
aVI don't believe that,
p42
aVand I think the situation is changing.
p43
aVIt would be ridiculous to claim
p44
aVthat we know how we make consciousness
p45
aVin our brains,
p46
aVbut we certainly can begin
p47
aVto approach the question,
p48
aVand we can begin to see the shape of a solution.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd one more wonder to celebrate
p51
aVis the fact that we have imaging technologies
p52
aVthat now allow us to go inside the human brain
p53
aVand be able to do, for example,
p54
aVwhat you're seeing right now.
p55
aVThese are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab,
p56
aVand which show you, in a living brain,
p57
aVthe reconstruction of that brain.
p58
aVAnd this is a person who is alive.
p59
aVThis is not a person
p60
aVthat is being studied at autopsy.
p61
aVAnd even more \u2014
p62
aVand this is something that one can be really amazed about \u2014
p63
aVis what I'm going to show you next,
p64
aVwhich is going underneath the surface of the brain
p65
aVand actually looking in the living brain
p66
aVat real connections, real pathways.
p67
aVSo all of those colored lines
p68
aVcorrespond to bunches of axons,
p69
aVthe fibers that join cell bodies
p70
aVto synapses.
p71
aVAnd I'm sorry to disappoint you, they don't come in color.
p72
aVBut at any rate, they are there.
p73
aVThe colors are codes for the direction,
p74
aVfrom whether it is back to front
p75
aVor vice versa.
p76
aa(lp77
VAt any rate, what is consciousness?
p78
aVWhat is a conscious mind?
p79
aVAnd we could take a very simple view
p80
aVand say, well, it is that which we lose
p81
aVwhen we fall into deep sleep without dreams,
p82
aVor when we go under anesthesia,
p83
aVand it is what we regain
p84
aVwhen we recover from sleep
p85
aVor from anesthesia.
p86
aVBut what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia,
p87
aVor when we are in deep, dreamless sleep?
p88
aVWell first of all,
p89
aVit is a mind,
p90
aVwhich is a flow of mental images.
p91
aVAnd of course consider images
p92
aVthat can be sensory patterns,
p93
aVvisual, such as you're having right now
p94
aVin relation to the stage and me,
p95
aVor auditory images,
p96
aVas you are having now in relation to my words.
p97
aVThat flow of mental images
p98
aVis mind.
p99
aa(lp100
VBut there is something else
p101
aVthat we are all experiencing in this room.
p102
aVWe are not passive exhibitors
p103
aVof visual or auditory
p104
aVor tactile images.
p105
aVWe have selves.
p106
aVWe have a Me
p107
aVthat is automatically present
p108
aVin our minds right now.
p109
aVWe own our minds.
p110
aVAnd we have a sense that it's everyone of us
p111
aVthat is experiencing this \u2014
p112
aVnot the person who is sitting next to you.
p113
aVSo in order to have a conscious mind,
p114
aVyou have a self within the conscious mind.
p115
aVSo a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.
p116
aVThe self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind,
p117
aVand we are only fully conscious
p118
aVwhen self comes to mind.
p119
aVSo what we need to know to even address this mystery
p120
aVis, number one, how are minds are put together in the brain,
p121
aVand, number two, how selves are constructed.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow the first part, the first problem,
p124
aVis relatively easy \u2014 it's not easy at all \u2014
p125
aVbut it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience.
p126
aVAnd it's quite clear that, in order to make minds,
p127
aVwe need to construct neural maps.
p128
aVSo imagine a grid, like the one I'm showing you right now,
p129
aVand now imagine, within that grid,
p130
aVthat two-dimensional sheet,
p131
aVimagine neurons.
p132
aVAnd picture, if you will,
p133
aVa billboard, a digital billboard,
p134
aVwhere you have elements
p135
aVthat can be either lit or not.
p136
aVAnd depending on how you create the pattern
p137
aVof lighting or not lighting,
p138
aVthe digital elements,
p139
aVor, for that matter, the neurons in the sheet,
p140
aVyou're going to be able to construct a map.
p141
aVThis, of course, is a visual map that I'm showing you,
p142
aVbut this applies to any kind of map \u2014
p143
aVauditory, for example, in relation to sound frequencies,
p144
aVor to the maps that we construct with our skin
p145
aVin relation to an object that we palpate.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow to bring home the point
p148
aVof how close it is \u2014
p149
aVthe relationship between the grid of neurons
p150
aVand the topographical arrangement
p151
aVof the activity of the neurons
p152
aVand our mental experience \u2014
p153
aVI'm going to tell you a personal story.
p154
aVSo if I cover my left eye \u2014
p155
aVI'm talking about me personally, not all of you \u2014
p156
aVif I cover my left eye,
p157
aVI look at the grid \u2014 pretty much like the one I'm showing you.
p158
aVEverything is nice and fine and perpendicular.
p159
aVBut sometime ago, I discovered
p160
aVthat if I cover my left eye,
p161
aVinstead what I get is this.
p162
aVI look at the grid and I see a warping
p163
aVat the edge of my central-left field.
p164
aa(lp165
VVery odd \u2014 I've analyzed this for a while.
p166
aVBut sometime ago,
p167
aVthrough the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine,
p168
aVCarmen Puliafito,
p169
aVwho developed a laser scanner of the retina,
p170
aVI found out the the following.
p171
aVIf I scan my retina
p172
aVthrough the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner,
p173
aVwhat I get is the following.
p174
aVOn the right side, my retina is perfectly symmetrical.
p175
aVYou see the going down towards the fovea
p176
aVwhere the optic nerve begins.
p177
aVBut on my left retina there is a bump,
p178
aVwhich is marked there by the red arrow.
p179
aVAnd it corresponds to a little cyst
p180
aVthat is located below.
p181
aVAnd that is exactly what causes
p182
aVthe warping of my visual image.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo just think of this:
p185
aVyou have a grid of neurons,
p186
aVand now you have a plane mechanical change
p187
aVin the position of the grid,
p188
aVand you get a warping of your mental experience.
p189
aVSo this is how close
p190
aVyour mental experience
p191
aVand the activity of the neurons in the retina,
p192
aVwhich is a part of the brain located in the eyeball,
p193
aVor, for that matter, a sheet of visual cortex.
p194
aVSo from the retina
p195
aVyou go onto visual cortex.
p196
aVAnd of course, the brain adds on
p197
aVa lot of information
p198
aVto what is going on
p199
aVin the signals that come from the retina.
p200
aVAnd in that image there,
p201
aVyou see a variety of islands
p202
aVof what I call image-making regions in the brain.
p203
aVYou have the green for example,
p204
aVthat corresponds to tactile information,
p205
aVor the blue that corresponds to auditory information.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd something else that happens
p208
aVis that those image-making regions
p209
aVwhere you have the plotting
p210
aVof all these neural maps,
p211
aVcan then provide signals
p212
aVto this ocean of purple that you see around,
p213
aVwhich is the association cortex,
p214
aVwhere you can make records of what went on
p215
aVin those islands of image-making.
p216
aVAnd the great beauty
p217
aVis that you can then go from memory,
p218
aVout of those association cortices,
p219
aVand produce back images
p220
aVin the very same regions that have perception.
p221
aVSo think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy
p222
aVthe brain is.
p223
aVSo it provides certain areas
p224
aVfor perception and image-making.
p225
aVAnd those are exactly the same
p226
aVthat are going to be used for image-making
p227
aVwhen we recall information.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo far the mystery of the conscious mind
p230
aVis diminishing a little bit
p231
aVbecause we have a general sense
p232
aVof how we make these images.
p233
aVBut what about the self?
p234
aVThe self is really the elusive problem.
p235
aVAnd for a long time,
p236
aVpeople did not even want to touch it,
p237
aVbecause they'd say,
p238
aV"How can you have this reference point, this stability,
p239
aVthat is required to maintain
p240
aVthe continuity of selves day after day?"
p241
aVAnd I thought about a solution to this problem.
p242
aVIt's the following.
p243
aVWe generate brain maps
p244
aVof the body's interior
p245
aVand use them as the reference for all other maps.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this.
p248
aVI came to this because,
p249
aVif you're going to have a reference that we know as self \u2014
p250
aVthe Me, the I
p251
aVin our own processing \u2014
p252
aVwe need to have something that is stable,
p253
aVsomething that does not deviate much
p254
aVfrom day to day.
p255
aVWell it so happens that we have a singular body.
p256
aVWe have one body, not two, not three.
p257
aVAnd so that is a beginning.
p258
aVThere is just one reference point, which is the body.
p259
aVBut then, of course, the body has many parts,
p260
aVand things grow at different rates,
p261
aVand they have different sizes and different people;
p262
aVhowever, not so with the interior.
p263
aVThe things that have to do
p264
aVwith what is known as our internal milieu \u2014
p265
aVfor example, the whole management
p266
aVof the chemistries within our body
p267
aVare, in fact, extremely maintained
p268
aVday after day
p269
aVfor one very good reason.
p270
aVIf you deviate too much
p271
aVin the parameters
p272
aVthat are close to the midline
p273
aVof that life-permitting survival range,
p274
aVyou go into disease or death.
p275
aVSo we have an in-built system
p276
aVwithin our own lives
p277
aVthat ensures some kind of continuity.
p278
aVI like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day.
p279
aVBecause if you don't have that sameness, physiologically,
p280
aVyou're going to be sick or you're going to die.
p281
aVSo that's one more element for this continuity.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd the final thing
p284
aVis that there is a very tight coupling
p285
aVbetween the regulation of our body within the brain
p286
aVand the body itself,
p287
aVunlike any other coupling.
p288
aVSo for example, I'm making images of you,
p289
aVbut there's no physiological bond
p290
aVbetween the images I have of you as an audience
p291
aVand my brain.
p292
aVHowever, there is a close, permanently maintained bond
p293
aVbetween the body regulating parts of my brain
p294
aVand my own body.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo here's how it looks. Look at the region there.
p297
aVThere is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex
p298
aVand the spinal cord.
p299
aVAnd it is within that region
p300
aVthat I'm going to highlight now
p301
aVthat we have this housing
p302
aVof all the life-regulation devices
p303
aVof the body.
p304
aVThis is so specific that, for example,
p305
aVif you look at the part that is covered in red
p306
aVin the upper part of the brain stem,
p307
aVif you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example,
p308
aVwhat you get is coma
p309
aVor vegetative state,
p310
aVwhich is a state, of course,
p311
aVin which your mind disappears,
p312
aVyour consciousness disappears.
p313
aVWhat happens then actually
p314
aVis that you lose the grounding of the self,
p315
aVyou have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence,
p316
aVand, in fact, there can be images going on,
p317
aVbeing formed in the cerebral cortex,
p318
aVexcept you don't know they're there.
p319
aVYou have, in effect, lost consciousness
p320
aVwhen you have damage to that red section of the brain stem.
p321
aa(lp322
VBut if you consider the green part of the brain stem,
p323
aVnothing like that happens.
p324
aVIt is that specific.
p325
aVSo in that green component of the brain stem,
p326
aVif you damage it, and often it happens,
p327
aVwhat you get is complete paralysis,
p328
aVbut your conscious mind is maintained.
p329
aVYou feel, you know, you have a fully conscious mind
p330
aVthat you can report very indirectly.
p331
aVThis is a horrific condition. You don't want to see it.
p332
aVAnd people are, in fact, imprisoned
p333
aVwithin their own bodies,
p334
aVbut they do have a mind.
p335
aVThere was a very interesting film,
p336
aVone of the rare good films done
p337
aVabout a situation like this,
p338
aVby Julian Schnabel some years ago
p339
aVabout a patient that was in that condition.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo now I'm going to show you a picture.
p342
aVI promise not to say anything about this,
p343
aVexcept this is to frighten you.
p344
aVIt's just to tell you
p345
aVthat in that red section of the brain stem,
p346
aVthere are, to make it simple,
p347
aVall those little squares that correspond to modules
p348
aVthat actually make brain maps
p349
aVof different aspects of our interior,
p350
aVdifferent aspects of our body.
p351
aVThey are exquisitely topographic
p352
aVand they are exquisitely interconnected
p353
aVin a recursive pattern.
p354
aVAnd it is out of this and out of this tight coupling
p355
aVbetween the brain stem and the body
p356
aVthat I believe \u2014 and I could be wrong,
p357
aVbut I don't think I am \u2014
p358
aVthat you generate this mapping of the body
p359
aVthat provides the grounding for the self
p360
aVand that comes in the form of feelings \u2014
p361
aVprimordial feelings, by the way.
p362
aa(lp363
VSo what is the picture that we get here?
p364
aVLook at "cerebral cortex," look at "brain stem,"
p365
aVlook at "body,"
p366
aVand you get the picture of the interconnectivity
p367
aVin which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self
p368
aVin a very tight interconnection with the body.
p369
aVAnd you have the cerebral cortex
p370
aVproviding the great spectacle of our minds
p371
aVwith the profusion of images
p372
aVthat are, in fact, the contents of our minds
p373
aVand that we normally pay most attention to,
p374
aVas we should, because that's really
p375
aVthe film that is rolling in our minds.
p376
aVBut look at the arrows.
p377
aVThey're not there for looks.
p378
aVThey're there because there's this very close interaction.
p379
aVYou cannot have a conscious mind
p380
aVif you don't have the interaction
p381
aVbetween cerebral cortex and brain stem.
p382
aVYou cannot have a conscious mind
p383
aVif you don't have the interaction
p384
aVbetween the brain stem and the body.
p385
aa(lp386
VAnother thing that is interesting
p387
aVis that the brain stem that we have
p388
aVis shared with a variety of other species.
p389
aVSo throughout vertebrates,
p390
aVthe design of the brain stem is very similar to ours,
p391
aVwhich is one of the reasons why I think
p392
aVthose other species have conscious minds like we do.
p393
aVExcept that they're not as rich as ours,
p394
aVbecause they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do.
p395
aVThat's where the difference is.
p396
aVAnd I strongly disagree with the idea
p397
aVthat consciousness should be considered
p398
aVas the great product of the cerebral cortex.
p399
aVOnly the wealth of our minds is,
p400
aVnot the very fact that we have a self
p401
aVthat we can refer
p402
aVto our own existence,
p403
aVand that we have any sense of person.
p404
aa(lp405
VNow there are three levels of self to consider \u2014
p406
aVthe proto, the core and the autobiographical.
p407
aVThe first two are shared
p408
aVwith many, many other species,
p409
aVand they are really coming out
p410
aVlargely of the brain stem
p411
aVand whatever there is of cortex in those species.
p412
aVIt's the autobiographical self
p413
aVwhich some species have, I think.
p414
aVCetaceans and primates have also
p415
aVan autobiographical self to a certain degree.
p416
aVAnd everybody's dogs at home
p417
aVhave an autobiographical self to a certain degree.
p418
aVBut the novelty is here.
p419
aa(lp420
VThe autobiographical self is built
p421
aVon the basis of past memories
p422
aVand memories of the plans that we have made;
p423
aVit's the lived past and the anticipated future.
p424
aVAnd the autobiographical self
p425
aVhas prompted extended memory, reasoning,
p426
aVimagination, creativity and language.
p427
aVAnd out of that came the instruments of culture \u2014
p428
aVreligions, justice,
p429
aVtrade, the arts, science, technology.
p430
aVAnd it is within that culture
p431
aVthat we really can get \u2014
p432
aVand this is the novelty \u2014
p433
aVsomething that is not entirely set by our biology.
p434
aVIt is developed in the cultures.
p435
aVIt developed in collectives of human beings.
p436
aVAnd this is, of course, the culture
p437
aVwhere we have developed something that I like to call
p438
aVsocio-cultural regulation.
p439
aa(lp440
VAnd finally, you could rightly ask,
p441
aVwhy care about this?
p442
aVWhy care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex
p443
aVand how this is made?
p444
aVThree reasons. First, curiosity.
p445
aVPrimates are extremely curious \u2014
p446
aVand humans most of all.
p447
aVAnd if we are interested, for example,
p448
aVin the fact that anti-gravity
p449
aVis pulling galaxies away from the Earth,
p450
aVwhy should we not be interested in what is going on
p451
aVinside of human beings?
p452
aa(lp453
VSecond, understanding society and culture.
p454
aVWe should look
p455
aVat how society and culture
p456
aVin this socio-cultural regulation
p457
aVare a work in progress.
p458
aVAnd finally, medicine.
p459
aVLet's not forget that some of the worst diseases
p460
aVof humankind
p461
aVare diseases such as depression,
p462
aVAlzheimer's disease, drug addiction.
p463
aVThink of strokes that can devastate your mind
p464
aVor render you unconscious.
p465
aVYou have no prayer
p466
aVof treating those diseases effectively
p467
aVand in a non-serendipitous way
p468
aVif you do not know how this works.
p469
aVSo that's a very good reason
p470
aVbeyond curiosity
p471
aVto justify what we're doing,
p472
aVand to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains.
p473
aa(lp474
VThank you for your attention.

VFrugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D.
p5
aVwhere we are looking to find
p6
aValternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society.
p7
aVThat's what we're after.
p8
aVAnd we do this because we actually believe
p9
aVthat silicon technology today is mostly about
p10
aVa culture of excess.
p11
aVIt's about the fastest and the most efficient
p12
aVand the most dazzling gadget you can have,
p13
aVwhile about two-thirds of the world
p14
aVcan hardly reach the most basic of this technology
p15
aVto even address fundamental needs in life,
p16
aVincluding health care, education
p17
aVand all these kinds of very fundamental issues.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo before I start, I want to talk about a little anecdote,
p20
aVa little story about a man I met once in Mumbai.
p21
aVSo this man, his name is Sathi Shri.
p22
aVHe is an outstanding person,
p23
aVbecause he's a small entrepreneur.
p24
aVHe runs a little shop
p25
aVin one of the back streets of Mumbai.
p26
aVHe has this little 10-square-meter store,
p27
aVwhere so much is being done.
p28
aVIt's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyes
p29
aVwhen I once just happened to bump into him.
p30
aVBasically, what he does is, he has all these services
p31
aVfor micro-payments and booking tickets
p32
aVand all kinds of basic things that you would go online for,
p33
aVbut he does it for people offline
p34
aVand connects to the digital world.
p35
aVMore importantly, he makes his money
p36
aVby selling these mobile recharge coupons, you know,
p37
aVfor the prepaid subscriptions.
p38
aVBut then, in the backside, he's got this little nook
p39
aVwith a few of his employees
p40
aVwhere they can fix almost anything.
p41
aVAny cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it.
p42
aVAnd it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there,
p43
aVand he was like, "Yeah, do you want an upgrade?"
p44
aV"Yes." (Laughter)
p45
aVI was a bit skeptical, but then, I decided
p46
aVto give him a Nokia instead. (Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VBut what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering
p49
aVand know-how that's built into this little two meters of space.
p50
aVThey have figured out everything that's required
p51
aVto dismantle, take things apart,
p52
aVrewrite the circuitry, re-flash the firmware,
p53
aVdo whatever you want to with the phone,
p54
aVand they can fix anything so quickly.
p55
aVYou can hand over a phone this morning
p56
aVand you can go pick it up after lunch,
p57
aVand it was quite incredible.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut then we were wondering whether this is
p60
aVa local phenomenon, or is truly global?
p61
aVAnd, over time, we started understanding
p62
aVand systematically researching
p63
aVwhat this tinkering ecosystem is about,
p64
aVbecause that is something that's happening
p65
aVnot just in one street corner in Mumbai.
p66
aVIt's actually happening in all parts of the country.
p67
aVIt's even happening in Africa, like, for example,
p68
aVin Cape Town we did extensive research on this.
p69
aVEven here in Doha I found this little nook
p70
aVwhere you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed,
p71
aVand it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy.
p72
aVYou've got to try it on your own to believe it.
p73
aa(lp74
VBut what fuels this?
p75
aVIt's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts
p76
aVand supplies that are produced all over the world, literally,
p77
aVand then redistributed to basically service this industry,
p78
aVand you can even buy salvaged parts.
p79
aVBasically, you don't have to necessarily buy
p80
aVbrand new things. You have condemned computers
p81
aVthat are stripped apart,
p82
aVand you can buy salvaged components
p83
aVand things that you can reassemble in a new configuration.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut what does this new, sort of, approach give us?
p86
aVThat's the real question, because this is something
p87
aVthat's been there, part of every society
p88
aVthat's deprived of enough resources.
p89
aVBut there's an interesting paradigm.
p90
aVThere's the traditional crafts,
p91
aVand then there's the technology crafts.
p92
aVWe call it the technology crafts because these are emerging.
p93
aVThey're not something that's been established.
p94
aVIt's not something that's institutionalized.
p95
aVIt's not taught in universities.
p96
aVIt's taught [by] word of mouth,
p97
aVand it's an informal education system around this.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo we said, "What can we get out of this?
p100
aVYou know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?"
p101
aVThe main thing is a fix-it-locally culture,
p102
aVwhich is fantastic because it means that your product
p103
aVor your service doesn't have to go through
p104
aVa huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed.
p105
aVIt also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic,
p106
aVso it means that you can do a lot more with it.
p107
aVAnd then, the most important thing is,
p108
aVit gives us large math for low cost.
p109
aVSo it means that you can actually embed
p110
aVpretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds
p111
aVof extendable ideas into really simple devices.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.
p114
aVIt's basically what was the system or the paradigm
p115
aVbefore the industrial revolution is now re-happening
p116
aVin a whole new way in small digital shops
p117
aVacross the planet in most developing countries.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, we kind of toyed around with this idea,
p120
aVand we said, "What can we do with this?
p121
aVCan we make a little product or a service out of it?"
p122
aVSo one of the first things we did is this thing called
p123
aVa multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box.
p124
aVBasically one of the contexts that we studied was
p125
aVschools in very remote parts of India.
p126
aVSo there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school,
p127
aVwhich is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker
p128
aVwho teaches this amazing little social setting.
p129
aVIt's an informal school,
p130
aVbut it's really about holistic education.
p131
aVThe only thing that they don't have
p132
aVis access to resources. They don't even have a textbook
p133
aVsometimes, and they don't even have a proper curriculum.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo we said, "What can we do to empower this teacher
p136
aVto do more?" How to access the digital world?
p137
aVInstead of being the sole guardian of information,
p138
aVbe a facilitator to all this information.
p139
aVSo we said, "What are the steps required to empower the teacher?"
p140
aVHow do you make this teacher into a digital gateway,
p141
aVand how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform
p142
aVthat can be constructed locally and serviced locally?"
p143
aVSo we walked around.
p144
aVWe went and scavenged the nearby markets,
p145
aVand we tried to understand, "What can we pick up that will make this happen?"
p146
aa(lp147
VSo the thing that we got
p148
aVwas a little mobile phone with a little pico projector
p149
aVthat comes for about 60 dollars.
p150
aVWe went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery,
p151
aVand a bunch of small speakers.
p152
aVSo essentially, the mobile phone gives us
p153
aVa connected multimedia platform.
p154
aVIt allows us to get online and allows us to load up files
p155
aVof different formats and play them.
p156
aVThe flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D.,
p157
aVand six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack,
p158
aVand the lunch box is a nice little package
p159
aVin which you can put everything inside,
p160
aVand a bunch of mini speakers to sort of
p161
aVamplify the sound large enough.
p162
aVBelieve me, those little classrooms are really noisy.
p163
aVThey are kids who scream at the top of their voices,
p164
aVand you really have to get above that.
p165
aVAnd we took it back to this little tinkering setup
p166
aVof a mobile phone repair shop,
p167
aVand then the magic happens.
p168
aVWe dismantle the whole thing,
p169
aVwe reassemble it in a new configuration,
p170
aVand we do this hardware mashup,
p171
aVsystematically training the guy how to do this.
p172
aVOut comes this, a little lunch box \u2014 form factor.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd we systematically field tested,
p177
aVbecause in the field testing we learned some
p178
aVimportant lessons, and we went through many iterations.
p179
aVOne of the key issues was battery consumption and charging.
p180
aVLuminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.
p181
aVOften the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough
p182
aVdarkness in the classroom to do these things.
p183
aa(lp184
VWe extended this idea. We tested it many times over,
p185
aVand the next version we came up with was a box
p186
aVthat kind of could trickle charge on solar energy,
p187
aVbut most importantly connect to a car battery,
p188
aVbecause a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power
p189
aVin places where there's not enough electricity
p190
aVor erratic electricity.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd the other key thing that we did was
p193
aVmake this box run off a USB key, because we realized
p194
aVthat even though there was GPRS and all that on paper,
p195
aVat least, in theory, it was much more efficient
p196
aVto send the data on a little USB key by surface mail.
p197
aVIt might take a few days to get there,
p198
aVbut at least it gets there in high definition
p199
aVand in a reliable quality.
p200
aVSo we made this box, and we tested it again
p201
aVand again and again, and we're going through
p202
aVmultiple iterations to do these things.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut it's not limited to just education.
p205
aVThis kind of a technique or metrology
p206
aVcan actually be applied to other kinds of areas,
p207
aVand I'm going to tell you one more little story.
p208
aVIt's about this little device called a medi-meter.
p209
aVIt's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.
p210
aa(lp211
VIn India, there is a context of these amazing people,
p212
aVthe health care workers called ASHA workers.
p213
aVThey are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system
p214
aVwho live in the local community and are trained
p215
aVwith basic tools and basic concepts of health care,
p216
aVand the main purpose is basically to inform people
p217
aVto basically, how to lead a better life, but also
p218
aVto divert or sort of make recommendations
p219
aVof what kind of health care should they approach?
p220
aVThey are basically referral services, essentially.
p221
aa(lp222
VBut the problem with that is that we realized
p223
aVafter a bunch of research that they are amazing
p224
aVat referring people to the nearest clinic
p225
aVor the public health care system, but what happens at the
p226
aVpublic health care system is this: these incredibly long lines
p227
aVand too many people who overload the system
p228
aVsimply because there's not enough doctors and facilities
p229
aVfor the population that's being referred.
p230
aVSo everything from a common cold
p231
aVto a serious case of malaria gets almost the same
p232
aVlevel of attention, and there's no priorities.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo we said, "Come on, there's got to be a better way
p235
aVof doing this for sure."
p236
aVSo we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker
p237
aVthat'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter,
p238
aVbut not just a filter, a really well thought through referral
p239
aVsystem that allows load balancing of the network,
p240
aVand directs patients to different sources of health care
p241
aVbased on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?"
p242
aa(lp243
VSo the real key question was,
p244
aVhow do we empower this woman?
p245
aVHow do we empower her with simple tools
p246
aVthat's not diagnostic but more screening in nature
p247
aVso she at least knows how to advise the patients better?
p248
aVAnd that'll make such a huge difference on the system,
p249
aVbecause the amount of waiting time and the amount of
p250
aVdistances that people need to travel, often sometimes
p251
aVseven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot,
p252
aVto get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental
p253
aVin the sense that it really dissuades people
p254
aVfrom getting access to health care.
p255
aVSo if there was something that she could do,
p256
aVthat would be amazing.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo what we did was that we converted this device
p259
aVinto a medical device.
p260
aVI want to demo this actually,
p261
aVbecause it's a very simple process.
p262
aa(lp263
VBruno, do you want to join us? (Cheers)
p264
aVCome along. (Applause)
p265
aa(lp266
VSo, what we're going to do is that
p267
aVwe're going to measure a few basic parameters on you,
p268
aVincluding your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen
p269
aVthat's there in your blood.
p270
aVSo you're going to put your thumb on top of this.
p271
aa(lp272
VBruno Giussani: Like this, works?
p273
aa(lp274
VVinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.
p275
aa(lp276
VVV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.
p277
aV(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.
p278
aVSo ... (Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VSo I take it into the start position, and then
p281
aVI press the read button. (Beeps)
p282
aVSo it's taking a little reading from you. (Beeps)
p283
aVAnd then the pointer goes and points to three different options.
p284
aVLet's see what happens here.
p285
aV(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.
p286
aa(lp287
VBG: Great. Good news. (Applause)
p288
aa(lp289
VVV: So ... (Applause)
p290
aa(lp291
VSo the thing about this is that
p292
aVif the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot,
p293
aVwe would have to rush you to a hospital.
p294
aVLuckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange
p295
aVor the amber, it basically meant you had to have,
p296
aVsort of, more continuous care from the health care worker.
p297
aVSo that was a very simple three-step screening process
p298
aVthat could basically change the equation
p299
aVof how public health care works in so many different ways.
p300
aa(lp301
VBG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Applause)
p304
aVSo, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done,
p305
aVbecause that's the more interesting part.
p306
aVSo essentially, the three things that are required
p307
aVto make this conversion from this guy to this guy
p308
aVis a cheap remote control for a television
p309
aVthat you can almost find in every home today,
p310
aVsome parts from a computer mouse, basically,
p311
aVsomething that you can scavenge for very low cost,
p312
aVand a few parts that have to be pre-programmed.
p313
aVBasically this is a micro-controller with a few
p314
aVextra components that can be shipped for very little cost
p315
aVacross the world, and that's what is all required
p316
aVwith a little bit of local tinkering talent
p317
aVto convert the device into something else.
p318
aVSo we are right now doing some systematic field tests
p319
aVto basically ascertain whether something like this actually
p320
aVmakes sense to the ASHA worker.
p321
aa(lp322
VWe are going through some reference tests to compare it
p323
aVagainst professional equipment to see if there's a degree
p324
aVof change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact
p325
aVin people's lives. But most importantly,
p326
aVwhat we are trying to do right now
p327
aVis we are trying to scale this up, because there
p328
aVare over 250,000 ASHA workers on the ground
p329
aVwho are these amazing foot soldiers, and if we can
p330
aVgive at least a fraction of them the access to these things,
p331
aVit just changes the way the economics of public health care
p332
aVworks, and it changes the way systems actually function,
p333
aVnot just on a systematic planning level,
p334
aVbut also in a very grassroots, bottom-up level.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo that's it, and we hope to do this in a big way.
p337
aVThank you. (Applause)
p338

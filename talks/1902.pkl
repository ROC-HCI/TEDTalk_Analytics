VThis is an image of the planet Earth.
p5
aVIt looks very much like the Apollo pictures
p6
aVthat are very well known.
p7
aVThere is something different;
p8
aVyou can click on it,
p9
aVand if you click on it,
p10
aVyou can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth.
p11
aVFor instance, this is a bird's-eye view
p12
aVof the EPFL campus.
p13
aVIn many cases, you can also see
p14
aVhow a building looks from a nearby street.
p15
aVThis is pretty amazing.
p16
aVBut there's something missing in this wonderful tour:
p17
aVIt's time.
p18
aVi'm not really sure when this picture was taken.
p19
aVI'm not even sure it was taken
p20
aVat the same moment as the bird's-eye view.
p21
aVIn my lab, we develop tools
p22
aVto travel not only in space
p23
aVbut also through time.
p24
aVThe kind of question we're asking is
p25
aVIs it possible to build something
p26
aVlike Google Maps of the past?
p27
aVCan I add a slider on top of Google Maps
p28
aVand just change the year,
p29
aVseeing how it was 100 years before,
p30
aV1,000 years before?
p31
aVIs that possible?
p32
aVCan I reconstruct social networks of the past?
p33
aVCan I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages?
p34
aVSo, can I build time machines?
p35
aVMaybe we can just say, "No, it's not possible."
p36
aVOr, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view.
p37
aVThis is what I call the information mushroom.
p38
aVVertically, you have the time.
p39
aVand horizontally, the amount of digital information available.
p40
aVObviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information.
p41
aVAnd obviously the more we go in the past, the less information we have.
p42
aVIf we want to build something like Google Maps of the past,
p43
aVor Facebook of the past,
p44
aVwe need to enlarge this space,
p45
aVwe need to make that like a rectangle.
p46
aVHow do we do that?
p47
aVOne way is digitization.
p48
aVThere's a lot of material available \u2014
p49
aVnewspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books.
p50
aVI can digitize all these.
p51
aVI can extract information from these.
p52
aVOf course, the more you go in the past, the less information you will have.
p53
aVSo, it might not be enough.
p54
aVSo, I can do what historians do.
p55
aVI can extrapolate.
p56
aVThis is what we call, in computer science, simulation.
p57
aVIf I take a log book,
p58
aVI can consider, it's not just a log book
p59
aVof a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.
p60
aVI can consider it is actually a log book
p61
aVwhich is representative of many journeys of that period.
p62
aVI'm extrapolating.
p63
aVIf I have a painting of a facade,
p64
aVI can consider it's not just that particular building,
p65
aVbut probably it also shares the same grammar
p66
aVof buildings where we lost any information.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo if we want to construct a time machine,
p69
aVwe need two things.
p70
aVWe need very large archives,
p71
aVand we need excellent specialists.
p72
aVThe Venice Time Machine,
p73
aVthe project I'm going to talk to you about,
p74
aVis a joint project between the EPFL
p75
aVand the University of Venice Ca'Foscari.
p76
aa(lp77
VThere's something very peculiar about Venice,
p78
aVthat its administration has been
p79
aVvery, very bureaucratic.
p80
aVThey've been keeping track of everything,
p81
aValmost like Google today.
p82
aVAt the Archivio di Stato,
p83
aVyou have 80 kilometers of archives
p84
aVdocumenting every aspect
p85
aVof the life of Venice over more than 1,000 years.
p86
aVYou have every boat that goes out,
p87
aVevery boat that comes in.
p88
aVYou have every change that was made in the city.
p89
aVThis is all there.
p90
aVWe are setting up a 10-year digitization program
p91
aVwhich has the objective of transforming
p92
aVthis immense archive
p93
aVinto a giant information system.
p94
aVThe type of objective we want to reach
p95
aVis 450 books a day that can be digitized.
p96
aVOf course, when you digitize, that's not enough,
p97
aVbecause these documents,
p98
aVmost of them are in Latin, in Tuscan,
p99
aVin Venetian dialect,
p100
aVso you need to transcribe them,
p101
aVto translate them in some cases,
p102
aVto index them,
p103
aVand this is obviously not easy.
p104
aVIn particular, traditional optical character recognition method
p105
aVthat can be used for printed manuscripts,
p106
aVthey do not work well on the handwritten document.
p107
aVSo the solution is actually to take inspiration
p108
aVfrom another domain: speech recognition.
p109
aVThis is a domain of something  that seems impossible,
p110
aVwhich can actually be done,
p111
aVsimply by putting additional constraints.
p112
aVIf you have a very good model
p113
aVof a language which is used,
p114
aVif you have a very good model of a document,
p115
aVhow well they are structured.
p116
aVAnd these are administrative documents.
p117
aVThey are well structured in many cases.
p118
aVIf you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets
p119
aVwhere a smaller subset actually shares similar features,
p120
aVthen there's a chance of success.
p121
aa(lp122
VIf we reach that stage, then there's something else:
p123
aVwe can extract from this document events.
p124
aVActually probably 10 billion events
p125
aVcan be extracted from this archive.
p126
aVAnd this giant information system
p127
aVcan be searched in many ways.
p128
aVYou can ask questions like,
p129
aV"Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?"
p130
aV"How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market
p131
aVin 1434?"
p132
aV"What was the salary
p133
aVof a glass maker in Murano
p134
aVmaybe over a decade?"
p135
aVYou can ask even bigger questions
p136
aVbecause it will be semantically coded.
p137
aVAnd then what you can do is put that in space,
p138
aVbecause much of this information is spatial.
p139
aVAnd from that, you can do things like
p140
aVreconstructing this extraordinary journey
p141
aVof that city that managed to have a sustainable development
p142
aVover a thousand years,
p143
aVmanaging to have all the time
p144
aVa form of equilibrium with its environment.
p145
aVYou can reconstruct that journey,
p146
aVvisualize it in many different ways.
p147
aVBut of course, you cannot understand  Venice if you just look at the city.
p148
aVYou have to put it in a larger European context.
p149
aVSo the idea is also to document all the things
p150
aVthat worked at the European level.
p151
aVWe can reconstruct also the journey
p152
aVof the Venetian maritime empire,
p153
aVhow it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea,
p154
aVhow it became the most powerful medieval empire
p155
aVof its time,
p156
aVcontrolling most of the sea routes
p157
aVfrom the east to the south.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut you can even do other things,
p160
aVbecause in these maritime routes,
p161
aVthere are regular patterns.
p162
aVYou can go one step beyond
p163
aVand actually create a simulation system,
p164
aVcreate a Mediterranean simulator
p165
aVwhich is capable actually of reconstructing
p166
aVeven the information we are missing,
p167
aVwhich would enable us to have  questions you could ask
p168
aVlike if you were using a route planner.
p169
aa(lp170
V"If I am in Corfu in June 1323
p171
aVand want to go to Constantinople,
p172
aVwhere can I take a boat?"
p173
aa(lp174
VProbably we can answer this question
p175
aVwith one or two or three days' precision.
p176
aa(lp177
V"How much will it cost?"
p178
aa(lp179
V"What are the chance of encountering pirates?"
p180
aa(lp181
VOf course, you understand,
p182
aVthe central scientific challenge of a project like this one
p183
aVis qualifying, quantifying and representing
p184
aVuncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process.
p185
aVThere are errors everywhere,
p186
aVerrors in the document, it's the wrong name of the captain,
p187
aVsome of the boats never actually took to sea.
p188
aVThere are errors in translation, interpretative biases,
p189
aVand on top of that, if you add algorithmic processes,
p190
aVyou're going to have errors in recognition,
p191
aVerrors in extraction,
p192
aVso you have very, very uncertain data.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies?
p195
aVHow can we represent that form of uncertainty?
p196
aVIt's difficult. One thing you can do
p197
aVis document each step of the process,
p198
aVnot only coding the historical information
p199
aVbut what we call the meta-historical information,
p200
aVhow is historical knowledge constructed,
p201
aVdocumenting each step.
p202
aVThat will not guarantee that we actually converge
p203
aVtoward a single story of Venice,
p204
aVbut probably we can actually reconstruct
p205
aVa fully documented potential story of Venice.
p206
aVMaybe there's not a single map.
p207
aVMaybe there are several maps.
p208
aVThe system should allow for that,
p209
aVbecause we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty,
p210
aVwhich is really new for this type of giant databases.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd how should we communicate
p213
aVthis new research to a large audience?
p214
aVAgain, Venice is extraordinary for that.
p215
aVWith the millions of visitors that come every year,
p216
aVit's actually one of the best places
p217
aVto try to invent the museum of the future.
p218
aVImagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map
p219
aVof a given year,
p220
aVand vertically, you see the document
p221
aVthat served the reconstruction,
p222
aVpaintings, for instance.
p223
aVImagine an immersive system that permits
p224
aVto go and dive and reconstruct the Venice of a given year,
p225
aVsome experience you could share within a group.
p226
aVOn the contrary, imagine actually that you start
p227
aVfrom a document, a Venetian manuscript,
p228
aVand you show, actually, what you can construct out of it,
p229
aVhow it is decoded,
p230
aVhow the context of that document can be recreated.
p231
aVThis is an image from an exhibit
p232
aVwhich is currently conducted in Geneva
p233
aVwith that type of system.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo to conclude, we can say that
p236
aVresearch in the humanities is about to undergo
p237
aVan evolution which is maybe similar
p238
aVto what happened to life sciences 30 years ago.
p239
aVIt's really a question of scale.
p240
aVWe see projects which are
p241
aVmuch beyond any single research team can do,
p242
aVand this is really new for the humanities,
p243
aVwhich very often take the habit of working
p244
aVin small groups or only with a couple of researchers.
p245
aVWhen you visit the Archivio di Stato,
p246
aVyou feel this is beyond what any single team can do,
p247
aVand that should be a joint and common effort.
p248
aVSo what we must do for this paradigm shift
p249
aVis actually foster a new generation
p250
aVof "digital humanists"
p251
aVthat are going to be ready for this shift.
p252
aa(lp253
VI thank you very much.

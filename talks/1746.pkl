VThere's something that I'd like you to see.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Video) Reporter: It's a story that's deeply unsettled
p7
aVmillions in China:
p8
aVfootage of a two-year-old girl
p9
aVhit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby,
p10
aVfootage too graphic to be shown.
p11
aVThe entire accident is caught on camera.
p12
aVThe driver pauses after hitting the child,
p13
aVhis back wheels seen resting on her for over a second.
p14
aVWithin two minutes, three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by.
p15
aVThe first walks around the badly injured toddler completely.
p16
aVOthers look at her before moving off.
p17
aa(lp18
VPeter Singer: There were other people
p19
aVwho walked past Wang Yue,
p20
aVand a second van ran over her legs
p21
aVbefore a street cleaner raised the alarm.
p22
aVShe was rushed to hospital, but it was too late. She died.
p23
aa(lp24
VI wonder how many of you, looking at that,
p25
aVsaid to yourselves just now, "I would not have done that.
p26
aVI would have stopped to help."
p27
aVRaise your hands if that thought occurred to you.
p28
aa(lp29
VAs I thought, that's most of you.
p30
aVAnd I believe you. I'm sure you're right.
p31
aVBut before you give yourself too much credit,
p32
aVlook at this.
p33
aVUNICEF reports that in 2011,
p34
aV6.9 million children under five
p35
aVdied from preventable, poverty-related diseases.
p36
aVUNICEF thinks that that's good news
p37
aVbecause the figure has been steadily coming down
p38
aVfrom 12 million in 1990. That is good.
p39
aVBut still, 6.9 million
p40
aVis 19,000 children dying every day.
p41
aVDoes it really matter
p42
aVthat we're not walking past them in the street?
p43
aVDoes it really matter that they're far away?
p44
aVI don't think it does make a morally relevant difference.
p45
aVThe fact that they're not right in front of us,
p46
aVthe fact, of course, that they're of a different nationality
p47
aVor race, none of that seems morally relevant to me.
p48
aVWhat is really important is,
p49
aVcan we reduce that death toll? Can we save
p50
aVsome of those 19,000 children dying every day?
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd the answer is, yes we can.
p53
aVEach of us spends money
p54
aVon things that we do not really need.
p55
aVYou can think what your own habit is,
p56
aVwhether it's a new car, a vacation
p57
aVor just something like buying bottled water
p58
aVwhen the water that comes out of the tap
p59
aVis perfectly safe to drink.
p60
aVYou could take the money you're spending
p61
aVon those unnecessary things
p62
aVand give it to this organization,
p63
aVthe Against Malaria Foundation,
p64
aVwhich would take the money you had given
p65
aVand use it to buy nets like this one
p66
aVto protect children like this one,
p67
aVand we know reliably that if we provide nets,
p68
aVthey're used, and they reduce the number of children
p69
aVdying from malaria,
p70
aVjust one of the many preventable diseases
p71
aVthat are responsible for some of those 19,000 children
p72
aVdying every day.
p73
aa(lp74
VFortunately, more and more people
p75
aVare understanding this idea,
p76
aVand the result is a growing movement:
p77
aVeffective altruism.
p78
aVIt's important because it combines both the heart and the head.
p79
aVThe heart, of course, you felt.
p80
aVYou felt the empathy for that child.
p81
aVBut it's really important to use the head as well
p82
aVto make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed,
p83
aVand not only that, but also I think reason helps us
p84
aVto understand that other people, wherever they are,
p85
aVare like us, that they can suffer as we can,
p86
aVthat parents grieve for the deaths of their children,
p87
aVas we do,
p88
aVand that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us,
p89
aVit matters just as much to all of these people.
p90
aVSo I think reason is not just some neutral tool
p91
aVto help you get whatever you want.
p92
aVIt does help us to put perspective on our situation.
p93
aVAnd I think that's why
p94
aVmany of the most significant people in effective altruism
p95
aVhave been people who have had backgrounds
p96
aVin philosophy or economics or math.
p97
aVAnd that might seem surprising,
p98
aVbecause a lot of people think,
p99
aV"Philosophy is remote from the real world;
p100
aVeconomics, we're told, just makes us more selfish,
p101
aVand we know that math is for nerds."
p102
aVBut in fact it does make a difference,
p103
aVand in fact there's one particular nerd
p104
aVwho has been a particularly effective altruist
p105
aVbecause he got this.
p106
aa(lp107
VThis is the website of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
p108
aVand if you look at the words on the top right-hand side,
p109
aVit says, "All lives have equal value."
p110
aVThat's the understanding,
p111
aVthe rational understanding of our situation in the world
p112
aVthat has led to these people
p113
aVbeing the most effective altruists in history,
p114
aVBill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VNo one, not Andrew Carnegie, not John D. Rockefeller,
p119
aVhas ever given as much to charity
p120
aVas each one of these three,
p121
aVand they have used their intelligence
p122
aVto make sure that it is highly effective.
p123
aVAccording to one estimate, the Gates Foundation
p124
aVhas already saved 5.8 million lives
p125
aVand many millions more, people, getting diseases
p126
aVthat would have made them very sick,
p127
aVeven if eventually they survived.
p128
aVOver the coming years, undoubtably the Gates Foundation
p129
aVis going to give a lot more,
p130
aVis going to save a lot more lives.
p131
aVWell, you might say, that's fine if you're a billionaire,
p132
aVyou can have that kind of impact.
p133
aVBut if I'm not, what can I do?
p134
aVSo I'm going to look at four questions that people ask
p135
aVthat maybe stand in the way of them giving.
p136
aa(lp137
VThey worry how much of a difference they can make.
p138
aVBut you don't have to be a billionaire.
p139
aVThis is Toby Ord. He's a research fellow in philosophy
p140
aVat the University of Oxford.
p141
aVHe became an effective altruist when he calculated
p142
aVthat with the money that he was likely to earn
p143
aVthroughout his career, an academic career,
p144
aVhe could give enough to cure 80,000 people of blindness
p145
aVin developing countries
p146
aVand still have enough left
p147
aVfor a perfectly adequate standard of living.
p148
aVSo Toby founded an organization
p149
aVcalled Giving What We Can to spread this information,
p150
aVto unite people who want to share some of their income,
p151
aVand to ask people to pledge to give 10 percent
p152
aVof what they earn over their lifetime
p153
aVto fighting global poverty.
p154
aVToby himself does better than that.
p155
aVHe's pledged to live on 18,000 pounds a year \u2014
p156
aVthat's less than 30,000 dollars \u2014
p157
aVand to give the rest to those organizations.
p158
aVAnd yes, Toby is married and he does have a mortgage.
p159
aa(lp160
VThis is a couple at a later stage of life,
p161
aVCharlie Bresler and Diana Schott,
p162
aVwho, when they were young, when they met,
p163
aVwere activists against the Vietnam War,
p164
aVfought for social justice,
p165
aVand then moved into careers, as most people do,
p166
aVdidn't really do anything very active about those values,
p167
aValthough they didn't abandon them.
p168
aVAnd then, as they got to the age at which many people
p169
aVstart to think of retirement, they returned to them,
p170
aVand they've decided to cut back on their spending,
p171
aVto live modestly, and to give both money and time
p172
aVto helping to fight global poverty.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, mentioning time might lead you to think,
p175
aV"Well, should I abandon my career and put all of my time
p176
aVinto saving some of these 19,000 lives
p177
aVthat are lost every day?"
p178
aVOne person who's thought quite a bit about this issue
p179
aVof how you can have a career that will have
p180
aVthe biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch.
p181
aVHe's a graduate student in philosophy,
p182
aVand he's set up a website called 80,000 Hours,
p183
aVthe number of hours he estimates
p184
aVmost people spend on their career,
p185
aVto advise people on how to have the best,
p186
aVmost effective career.
p187
aVBut you might be surprised to know
p188
aVthat one of the careers that he encourages people to consider,
p189
aVif they have the right abilities and character,
p190
aVis to go into banking or finance.
p191
aVWhy? Because if you earn a lot of money,
p192
aVyou can give away a lot of money,
p193
aVand if you're successful in that career,
p194
aVyou could give enough to an aid organization
p195
aVso that it could employ, let's say, five aid workers
p196
aVin developing countries, and each one of them
p197
aVwould probably do about as much good
p198
aVas you would have done.
p199
aVSo you can quintuple the impact
p200
aVby leading that kind of career.
p201
aVHere's one young man who's taken this advice.
p202
aVHis name is Matt Weiger.
p203
aVHe was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math,
p204
aVactually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis
p205
aVlast year when he graduated.
p206
aVBut he's gone into finance in New York.
p207
aVHe's already earning enough
p208
aVso that he's giving a six-figure sum to effective charities
p209
aVand still leaving himself with enough to live on.
p210
aVMatt has also helped me to set up an organization
p211
aVthat I'm working with that has the name taken
p212
aVfrom the title of a book I wrote,
p213
aV"The Life You Can Save,"
p214
aVwhich is trying to change our culture
p215
aVso that more people think that
p216
aVif we're going to live an ethical life,
p217
aVit's not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots
p218
aVand not cheat, steal, maim, kill,
p219
aVbut that if we have enough, we have to share some of that
p220
aVwith people who have so little.
p221
aVAnd the organization draws together people
p222
aVof different generations,
p223
aVlike Holly Morgan, who's an undergraduate,
p224
aVwho's pledged to give 10 percent
p225
aVof the little amount that she has,
p226
aVand on the right, Ada Wan,
p227
aVwho has worked directly for the poor, but has now
p228
aVgone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give.
p229
aa(lp230
VMany people will think, though,
p231
aVthat charities aren't really all that effective.
p232
aVSo let's talk about effectiveness.
p233
aVToby Ord is very concerned about this,
p234
aVand he's calculated that some charities
p235
aVare hundreds or even thousands of times
p236
aVmore effective than others,
p237
aVso it's very important to find the effective ones.
p238
aVTake, for example, providing a guide dog for a blind person.
p239
aVThat's a good thing to do, right?
p240
aVWell, right, it is a good thing to do,
p241
aVbut you have to think what else you could do with the resources.
p242
aVIt costs about 40,000 dollars to train a guide dog
p243
aVand train the recipient so that the guide dog
p244
aVcan be an effective help to a blind person.
p245
aVIt costs somewhere between 20 and 50 dollars
p246
aVto cure a blind person in a developing country
p247
aVif they have trachoma.
p248
aVSo you do the sums, and you get something like that.
p249
aVYou could provide one guide dog
p250
aVfor one blind American,
p251
aVor you could cure between 400
p252
aVand 2,000 people of blindness.
p253
aVI think it's clear what's the better thing to do.
p254
aVBut if you want to look for effective charities,
p255
aVthis is a good website to go to.
p256
aVGiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities,
p257
aVnot just whether they're well-run,
p258
aVand it's screened hundreds of charities
p259
aVand currently is recommending only three,
p260
aVof which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one.
p261
aVSo it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations,
p262
aVthelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can
p263
aVboth have a somewhat broader list,
p264
aVbut you can find effective organizations,
p265
aVand not just in the area of saving lives from the poor.
p266
aVI'm pleased to say that there is now also a website
p267
aVlooking at effective animal organizations.
p268
aVThat's another cause that I've been concerned about
p269
aVall my life, the immense amount of suffering
p270
aVthat humans inflict
p271
aVon literally tens of billions of animals every year.
p272
aVSo if you want to look for effective organizations
p273
aVto reduce that suffering,
p274
aVyou can go to Effective Animal Activism.
p275
aVAnd some effective altruists think it's very important
p276
aVto make sure that our species survives at all.
p277
aVSo they're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction.
p278
aVHere's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of
p279
aVrecently, when an asteroid passed close to our planet.
p280
aVPossibly research could help us not only to predict
p281
aVthe path of asteroids that might collide with us,
p282
aVbut actually to deflect them.
p283
aVSo some people think that would be a good thing to give to.
p284
aVThere's many possibilities.
p285
aa(lp286
VMy final question is,
p287
aVsome people will think it's a burden to give.
p288
aVI don't really believe it is.
p289
aVI've enjoyed giving all of my life
p290
aVsince I was a graduate student.
p291
aVIt's been something fulfilling to me.
p292
aVCharlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist.
p293
aVHe thinks that the life he's saving is his own.
p294
aVAnd Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression
p295
aVuntil she got involved with effective altruism,
p296
aVand now is one of the happiest people she knows.
p297
aVI think one of the reasons for this
p298
aVis that being an effective altruist helps to overcome
p299
aVwhat I call the Sisyphus problem.
p300
aVHere's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian,
p301
aVcondemned by the gods to push a huge boulder
p302
aVup to the top of the hill.
p303
aVJust as he gets there, the effort becomes too much,
p304
aVthe boulder escapes, rolls all the way down the hill,
p305
aVhe has to trudge back down to push it up again,
p306
aVand the same thing happens again and again
p307
aVfor all eternity.
p308
aVDoes that remind you of a consumer lifestyle,
p309
aVwhere you work hard to get money,
p310
aVyou spend that money on consumer goods
p311
aVwhich you hope you'll enjoy using?
p312
aVBut then the money's gone, you have to work hard
p313
aVto get more, spend more, and to maintain
p314
aVthe same level of happiness, it's kind of a hedonic treadmill.
p315
aVYou never get off, and you never really feel satisfied.
p316
aVBecoming an effective altruist gives you
p317
aVthat meaning and fulfillment.
p318
aVIt enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem
p319
aVon which you can feel your life was really worth living.
p320
aa(lp321
VI'm going to conclude by telling you
p322
aVabout an email that I received
p323
aVwhile I was writing this talk just a month or so ago.
p324
aVIt's from a man named Chris Croy, who I'd never heard of.
p325
aVThis is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery.
p326
aVWhy was he recovering from surgery?
p327
aa(lp328
VThe email began, "Last Tuesday,
p329
aVI anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger.
p330
aVThat started a kidney chain
p331
aVwhich enabled four people to receive kidneys."
p332
aa(lp333
VThere's about 100 people each year in the U.S.
p334
aVand more in other countries who do that.
p335
aVI was pleased to read it. Chris went on to say
p336
aVthat he'd been influenced by my writings in what he did.
p337
aVWell, I have to admit, I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that,
p338
aVbecause I still have two kidneys.
p339
aVBut Chris went on to say that he didn't think
p340
aVthat what he'd done was all that amazing,
p341
aVbecause he calculated that the number of life-years
p342
aVthat he had added to people, the extension of life,
p343
aVwas about the same that you could achieve
p344
aVif you gave 5,000 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation.
p345
aVAnd that did make me feel a little bit better,
p346
aVbecause I have given more than 5,000 dollars
p347
aVto the Against Malaria Foundation
p348
aVand to various other effective charities.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo if you're feeling bad
p351
aVbecause you still have two kidneys as well,
p352
aVthere's a way for you to get off the hook.
p353
aa(lp354
VThank you.

He gained recognition in the 1970s with his groundbreaking book <a href=\\"http://geni.us/animalliberation\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals</em></a>, which questions society&rsquo;s tendency to put human needs above those of members of other species. And he draws fire from critics who object to his fascinating argument in favor of an obligation to help the global poor that sets the bar so high that it means we are almost all living unethically. His defense of euthanasia and infanticide, in some circumstances, has led to protests against his lectures and to teaching position at Princeton.</p><p>But Singer&rsquo;s collective body of work is more acclaimed than controversial. He has written the classic text&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/practicalethics\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Practical Ethics</em></a>&nbsp;and many other books, with more in progress.

<em>The New Yorker</em> calls him, the planet&rsquo;s &ldquo;most influential living philosopher.&rdquo; The Australian academic specializes in applied ethics, to which he takes a secular, utilitarian approach -- minimize suffering, maximize well-being. He gained recognition in the 1970s with his groundbreaking book <a href=\\"http://geni.us/animalliberation\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals</em></a>, which questions society&rsquo;s tendency to put human needs above those of members of other species. And he draws fire from critics who object to his fascinating argument in favor of an obligation to help the global poor that sets the bar so high that it means we are almost all living unethically. His defense of euthanasia and infanticide, in some circumstances, has led to protests against his lectures and to teaching position at Princeton.</p><p>But Singer&rsquo;s collective body of work is more acclaimed than controversial. He has written the classic text&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/practicalethics\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Practical Ethics</em></a>&nbsp;and many other books, with more in progress. He lectures at Princeton, where he is professor of bioethics, and the University of Melbourne, where he is a laureate professor. You can find dozens of brief, brilliant essays at <a href=\\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/contributor/peter-singer\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Project Syndicate</a>, where Singer examines the philosophical questions surrounding current topics like Obamacare, computer piracy and obesity.</p>", "slug": "peter_singer", "whotheyare": "Sometimes controversial, always practical ethicist Peter Singer stirs public debate about morality, from animal welfare to global poverty.", "whatotherssay": "Singer\\u2019s work is challenging, not because his writing is difficult to understand but because it is all too clear.

VI have been a police officer for a very, very long time.
p5
aVAnd you see these notes in my hand because I'm also a black preacher.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd if you know anything about black preachers,
p10
aVwe'll close, and then we'll keep going for another 20 minutes.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VSo I need this to keep pushing this thing forward.
p15
aVI've been a police officer for a very long time,
p16
aVand I mean I predated technology.
p17
aVI'm talking about before pagers.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VLaugh if you want to, but I'm telling the truth.
p22
aVI predate War on Our Fellow Man \u2014 I mean, War on Drugs.
p23
aVI predate all of that.
p24
aVI predate so much
p25
aVand I've been through ebbs and flows
p26
aVand I've been through good and bad times,
p27
aVand still I absolutely love being a police officer.
p28
aVI love being a police officer because it's always been a calling for me
p29
aVand never a job.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd even with that,
p32
aVmy personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis.
p33
aVIt's an invisible crisis,
p34
aVand it has been for many, many years.
p35
aVEven though we in law enforcement say,
p36
aV"You know what? We can't arrest our way out of this."
p37
aVWe say in law enforcement things like,
p38
aV"Yeah, it's illegal to profile."
p39
aVYou know what?
p40
aVIn law enforcement, we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking
p41
aVand become more oriented to community policing.
p42
aVAnd yet all the while, still,
p43
aVwe continue in the same vein,
p44
aVthe same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd so that's the reason for me, several years ago.
p47
aVBecause I was tired of the racism, I was tired of discrimination,
p48
aVI was tired of the "-isms" and the schisms.
p49
aVI was just so tired.
p50
aVI was tired of the vicious cycle,
p51
aVand I was tired of it even in the beloved agency
p52
aVin the department that I still love today.
p53
aVAnd so my wife and I, we sat down
p54
aVand we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire.
p55
aVWe would retire and I would go off into the sunset,
p56
aVmaybe do ministry full time, love my wife a long time.
p57
aVY'all know what I'm talking about.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VBut we decided that I would retire.
p62
aVBut then there was a higher power than I.
p63
aVThere was a love for the city
p64
aVthat I loved, that I grew up in, that I was educated in \u2014
p65
aVa city that pulled my heart back into the system.
p66
aVSo we didn't retire.
p67
aVWe didn't retire
p68
aVand so what happened was,
p69
aVover the next \u2014 I would say, 18 months, 19 months,
p70
aVI had this passion to implement some radical policing.
p71
aVAnd so now, over the next 19 months,
p72
aVI shifted, and I transcended from being a drug sergeant \u2014
p73
aVready to retire as a drug sergeant \u2014
p74
aVand went from level to level to level,
p75
aVuntil I find myself as a district commander,
p76
aVcommander of the worst district in Baltimore city.
p77
aVWe call it the Eastern District,
p78
aVthe most violent district,
p79
aVthe most impoverished district \u2014
p80
aV46 percent unemployment in that district.
p81
aVNational rating at that time,
p82
aVnational rating, the AIDS and the tuberculosis [rating],
p83
aVwas always on the top 10 list
p84
aVfor zip codes for cities across the nation,
p85
aVor just zip codes across the nation.
p86
aVThe top 10 \u2014 I didn't say state, I didn't say city \u2014
p87
aVthat little neighborhood.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd I said, you know what? We gotta do something different.
p90
aVWe gotta do something different. We gotta think radical.
p91
aVWe gotta think outside the box.
p92
aVAnd so in order to bring change that I desperately wanted
p93
aVand I desperately felt in my heart,
p94
aVI had to start listening to that inner spirit.
p95
aVI had to start listening to that man on the inside
p96
aVthat went against everything that I had been trained to do.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut we still did it.
p99
aVWe still did it because we listened to that inner spirit,
p100
aVbecause I realized this:
p101
aVif I was to see real police reform
p102
aVin the communities that I had authority over for public safety,
p103
aVwe had to change our stinkin' thinkin'.
p104
aa(lp105
VWe had to change it.
p106
aVAnd so what we did is we started to think holistically
p107
aVand not paramilitarily.
p108
aVSo we thought differently.
p109
aVAnd we started to realize
p110
aVthat it could never be and never should have been
p111
aVus versus them.
p112
aVAnd so I decided to come to that intersection
p113
aVwhere I could meet all classes, all races, all creeds, all colors;
p114
aVwhere I would meet the businesses and the faith-based,
p115
aVand the eds, the meds,
p116
aVand I would meet all the people
p117
aVthat made up the communities that I had authority over.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo I met them and I began to listen.
p120
aVSee, police have a problem.
p121
aVOff the top, we want to bring things into the community
p122
aVand come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments,
p123
aVbut we never talk to the community about them.
p124
aVAnd we shove them into the community and say, "Take that."
p125
aVBut we said we'd get rid of that stinkin' thinkin',
p126
aVso we talked to our communities.
p127
aVWe said, "This is your community table.
p128
aVWe'll pull up a chair. We want to hear from you.
p129
aVWhat's going to work in your community?"
p130
aVAnd then some great things started to happen.
p131
aa(lp132
VSee, here's the thing:
p133
aVI had to figure out a way to shift 130 cops that were under my tutelage
p134
aVfrom being occupiers of communities
p135
aVto being partners.
p136
aVI had to figure out how to do that.
p137
aVBecause here's the crazy thing:
p138
aVin law enforcement, we have evolved into something incredible.
p139
aVListen, we have become great protectors.
p140
aVWe know how to protect you.
p141
aVBut we have exercised that arm so much, so very much.
p142
aVIf I was a natural police department
p143
aVand I represented a police department,
p144
aVyou would see this incredible, beautiful, 23-inch arm.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VIt's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up.
p149
aVNo fat on it. Mmm it look good. It just look good!
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VThat's a great arm \u2014 protection!
p154
aVThat's who we are, but we've exercised it so much sometimes
p155
aVthat it has led to abuse.
p156
aVIt's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us.
p157
aVAnd we've forgotten
p158
aVthe mantra across this nation
p159
aVis to protect and serve.
p160
aVY'all don't know that? Protect and serve.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VSo you look at the other arm,
p165
aVand then you look at it and ... there it is.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VYou know, it's kinda weak.
p170
aVIt looks sickly.
p171
aVIt's withering and it's dying
p172
aVbecause we've invested so much in our protective arm.
p173
aVBut we forgot to treat our communities
p174
aVlike they're our customers;
p175
aVlike they're our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters,
p176
aVour mothers and fathers.
p177
aVAnd so somehow, along the way,
p178
aVwe've gotten out of balance.
p179
aVAnd because we are a proud profession,
p180
aVit is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes.
p181
aVIt's even harder to make a change.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd so, as I try to hurry and get through this,
p184
aVI need to say this:
p185
aVit's not just law enforcement, though.
p186
aVBecause every one of us makes up a community.
p187
aVEverybody makes up a community.
p188
aVAnd as communities \u2014 can I say this? \u2014
p189
aVwe have put too much responsibility on law enforcement.
p190
aVToo much.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset
p195
aVwith law enforcement when we take action.
p196
aVThere is no way in the world
p197
aVthat we, as a community, should be calling the police
p198
aVfor kids playing ball in the street.
p199
aVNo way in the world that we should be calling the police
p200
aVbecause my neighbor's music is up too loud,
p201
aVbecause his dog came over to my yard and did a number two;
p202
aVthere's no way we should be calling the police.
p203
aVBut we have surrendered so much of our responsibility.
p204
aVListen, when I was a little boy coming up in Baltimore \u2014
p205
aVand listen, we played rough in the street \u2014
p206
aVI ain't never see the police come and break us up.
p207
aVYou know who came? It was the elders.
p208
aVIt was the parental figures in the community.
p209
aVIt was those guardians, it was that village mentality.
p210
aVThey came and said, "Stop that!" and "Do this." and "Stop that."
p211
aVWe had mentors throughout all of the community.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo it takes all of us, all of us.
p214
aVAnd when I say community,
p215
aVI'm talking about everything that makes up a community, even \u2014
p216
aVlisten, because I'm a preacher, I'm very hard on the churches,
p217
aVbecause I believe the churches too often have become MIA,
p218
aVmissing in action.
p219
aVI believe they have shifted over the last 10, 20 years
p220
aVfrom being community churches,
p221
aVwhere you walk outside your door, round the corner and you're in church.
p222
aVThey shifted from that and became commuter churches.
p223
aVSo you now have churches who have become disconnected by default
p224
aVfrom the very community where they're planted.
p225
aVAnd they don't take care of that community.
p226
aa(lp227
VI could go on and on, but I really need to wrap this up.
p228
aVCommunity and policing:
p229
aVwe've all lost that precious gift, and I call it relational equity.
p230
aVWe've lost it with one another.
p231
aVIt's not somebody else's fault \u2014
p232
aVit's all of our fault.
p233
aVWe all take responsibility in this.
p234
aVBut I say this: it's not too late for all of us to build our cities
p235
aVand nation to make it great again.
p236
aVIt is never too late.
p237
aVIt is never too late.
p238
aVYou see, after three years
p239
aVof my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district,
p240
aVthree years in,
p241
aVafter putting pastors in the car with my police
p242
aVbecause I knew this \u2014 it's a little secret \u2014
p243
aVI knew this:
p244
aVit was hard to stay a nasty police officer
p245
aVwhile you're riding around with a clergy.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
V(Applause)
p250
aa(lp251
VYou'd be getting in and out of the car, looking to your right, talking about:
p252
aV"Father, forgive me, for I have sinned," all day long \u2014 you can't do it!
p253
aVSo we came up with some incredible initiatives,
p254
aVengagements for our community and police to build that trust back.
p255
aVWe began to deal with our youth
p256
aVand with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence.
p257
aVWe knew we had an economic problem,
p258
aVso we began to create jobs.
p259
aVWe knew there was sickness in our community
p260
aVand they didn't have access to proper medical care,
p261
aVso we'd partner up.
p262
aVWe got to that intersection and partnered up
p263
aVwith anybody that wanted to partner with us
p264
aVand talked about what we needed holistically,
p265
aVnever thinking about the crime.
p266
aVBecause at the end of the day,
p267
aVif we took care of the needs of the people,
p268
aVif we got to the root cause,
p269
aVthe crime would take care of itself.
p270
aVIt would take care of itself.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd so, after three years of a four-and-a-half-year stint,
p275
aVwe looked back and we looked over
p276
aVand found out that we were at a 40-year historical low:
p277
aVour crime numbers, our homicides \u2014
p278
aVeverything had dropped down, back to the 1970s.
p279
aVAnd it might go back further,
p280
aVbut the problem is, we only started keeping data since 1970.
p281
aVForty-year crime low, so much so, I had other commanders call me,
p282
aV"Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man?
p283
aVWhatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd so we gave them some of that.
p288
aVAnd in a short period of time,
p289
aVthe city went to a 30-year crime low.
p290
aVFor the first time in 30 years, we fell, Baltimore city,
p291
aVto under 200 homicides \u2014 197 to be exact.
p292
aVAnd we celebrated,
p293
aVbecause we had learned to become great servers,
p294
aVbecome great servers first.
p295
aa(lp296
VBut I gotta tell you this: these last few years,
p297
aVas much as we had learned
p298
aVto become great proactive police officers
p299
aVand great relational police officers rather than reactive,
p300
aVthese last years have disappointed me.
p301
aVThey have broken my heart.
p302
aVThe uprising still hurts.
p303
aVIt still hurts my heart,
p304
aVbecause truly I believe that it should've never happened.
p305
aVI believe it should've never happened
p306
aVif we were allowed to continue along the vein that we were in,
p307
aVservicing our community,
p308
aVtreating them like human beings, treating them with respect,
p309
aVloving on them first.
p310
aVIf we continued in that vein,
p311
aVit would've never happened.
p312
aVBut somehow, we went back to business as usual.
p313
aa(lp314
VBut I'm excited again!
p315
aVI'm excited again, because now we have a police commissioner
p316
aVwho not only talks about community policing,
p317
aVbut he absolutely understands it,
p318
aVand more importantly, he embraces it.
p319
aVSo I'm very excited now.
p320
aVListen, I'm excited about Baltimore today,
p321
aVbecause we, as many cities, I believe shall rise from the ashes.
p322
aVI believe \u2014 I truly believe \u2014
p323
aa(lp324
V(Applause)
p325
aa(lp326
Vthat we will be great again.
p327
aVI believe,
p328
aVas we continue to wrap arms and continue to say,
p329
aV"We're in this together,"
p330
aVbecause it's not just an intersection:
p331
aVonce we meet, we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals,
p332
aVand this city will become great again.
p333
aVThis nation will become great again.
p334
aVBecause we have the same goal: we all want peace.
p335
aVWe all want respect for one another.
p336
aVWe all want love.
p337
aVAnd I believe we are back on that road,
p338
aVand I'm so excited about it.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo listen, I thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time.
p341
aa(lp342
VGod bless you all.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Applause)
p345
aa(lp346
VGod bless you.

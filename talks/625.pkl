VIt's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment
p5
aVwhen the finance, the credit, which drives our economies froze.
p6
aVA massive cardiac arrest.
p7
aVThe effect, the payback, perhaps, for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff,
p8
aVwhom we saw earlier.
p9
aVAbuse of steroids, binging and so on.
p10
aVAnd it's only a few months since governments
p11
aVinjected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat.
p12
aVAnd we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone,
p13
aVwhere no one quite knows what's worked, or what doesn't.
p14
aVWe don't have any very clear maps, any compass to guide us.
p15
aVWe don't know which experts to believe anymore.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhat I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers
p18
aVto what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis,
p19
aVwhat things we should be looking out for
p20
aVand how we can actually use the crisis.
p21
aVThere's a definition of leadership which says,
p22
aV"It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis
p23
aVfor the biggest possible effect."
p24
aVAnd I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis,
p25
aVwhich is by no means small, really is used to the full.
p26
aa(lp27
VI want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from.
p28
aVI've got a very confused background
p29
aVwhich perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times.
p30
aVI've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms, as you can see.
p31
aVI trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy.
p32
aVI've been a civil servant,
p33
aVand I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city, this university, as a student.
p36
aVAnd then as now, it was a beautiful place of balls and punts, beautiful people,
p37
aVmany of whom took to heart Ronald Reagan's comment
p38
aVthat, "even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm,
p39
aVwhy risk it?"
p40
aa(lp41
VBut when I was here,
p42
aVa lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation,
p43
aVleaving school at a time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment,
p44
aVand essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities.
p45
aVAnd I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts.
p46
aVAnd they were people who were not short of wit, or grace or energy,
p47
aVbut they had no hope, no jobs, no prospects.
p48
aVAnd when people aren't allowed to be useful,
p49
aVthey soon think that they're useless.
p50
aVAnd although that was great for the music business at the time,
p51
aVit wasn't much good for anything else.
p52
aVAnd ever since then, I've wondered why it is that capitalism
p53
aVis so amazingly efficient at some things, but so inefficient at others,
p54
aVwhy it's so innovative in some ways and so un-innovative in others.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, since that time,
p57
aVwe've actually been through an extraordinary boom,
p58
aVthe longest boom ever in the history of this country.
p59
aVUnprecedented wealth and prosperity,
p60
aVbut that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed.
p61
aVH.L. Mencken once said that, "to every complex problem,
p62
aVthere is a simple solution and it's wrong."
p63
aVBut I'm not saying growth is wrong,
p64
aVbut it's very striking that throughout the years of growth,
p65
aVmany things didn't get better.
p66
aVRates of depression carried on up, right across the Western world.
p67
aVIf you look at America, the proportion of Americans
p68
aVwith no one to talk to about important things
p69
aVwent up from a tenth to a quarter.
p70
aVWe commuted longer to work, but as you can see from this graph,
p71
aVthe longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be.
p72
aVAnd it became ever clearer that economic growth
p73
aVdoesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth.
p74
aa(lp75
VWe're now at another moment
p76
aVwhen another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market.
p77
aVThere will be a million unemployed young people here
p78
aVby the end of the year,
p79
aVthousands losing their jobs everyday in America.
p80
aVWe've got to do whatever we can to help them,
p81
aVbut we've also got to ask, I think, a more profound question
p82
aVof whether we use this crisis to jump forward
p83
aVto a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs,
p84
aVto a better balance of economy and society.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd I think one of the lessons of history is that
p87
aVeven the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity.
p88
aVThey bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream.
p89
aVThey often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms.
p90
aVAnd you saw that in the '30s,
p91
aVwhen the Great Depression paved the way
p92
aVfor Bretton Woods, welfare states and so on.
p93
aVAnd I think you can see around us now,
p94
aVsome of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism
p95
aVwhich could grow.
p96
aVYou can see it in daily life.
p97
aVWhen times are hard, people have to do things for themselves,
p98
aVand right across the world, Oxford, Omaha, Omsk,
p99
aVyou can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming,
p100
aVpeople taking over land, taking over roofs,
p101
aVturning barges into temporary farms.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd I'm a very small part of this.
p104
aVI have 60,000 of these things in my garden.
p105
aVA few of these. This is Atilla the hen.
p106
aVAnd I'm a very small part of a very large movement,
p107
aVwhich for some people is about survival,
p108
aVbut is also about values, about a different kind of economy,
p109
aVwhich isn't so much about consumption and credit,
p110
aVbut about things which matter to us.
p111
aVAnd everywhere too, you can see a proliferation of time banks
p112
aVand parallel currencies,
p113
aVpeople using smart technologies to link up
p114
aVall the resources freed up by the market \u2014 people, buildings, land \u2014
p115
aVand linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs.
p116
aa(lp117
VThere's a similar story, I think, for governments.
p118
aVRonald Reagan, again, said the two funniest sentences
p119
aVin the English language are,
p120
aV"I'm from the government. And I'm here to help."
p121
aVBut I think last year when governments did step in,
p122
aVpeople were quite glad that they were there, that they did act.
p123
aVBut now, a few months on,
p124
aVhowever good politicians are at swallowing frogs
p125
aVwithout pulling a face, as someone once put it,
p126
aVthey can't hide their uncertainty.
p127
aVBecause it's already clear
p128
aVhow much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy,
p129
aVreally went into fixing the past, bailing out the banks, the car companies,
p130
aVnot preparing us for the future.
p131
aVHow much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption,
p132
aVnot into solving the really profound problems we have to solve.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums
p135
aVwhich are being spent of our money and our children's money,
p136
aVnow, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking:
p137
aVSurely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision
p138
aVto accelerate the shift to a green economy,
p139
aVto prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities
p140
aVwhich scar countries like this and the United States
p141
aVrather than just giving the money to the incumbents?
p142
aVSurely, we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs, to civil society,
p143
aVfor people able to create the new,
p144
aVnot to the big, well-connected companies,
p145
aVbig, clunky government programs.
p146
aVAnd, after all this, as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said,
p147
aV"Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish.
p148
aVDon't overdo it."
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd I think more and more people are also asking:
p151
aVWhy boost consumption, rather than change what we consume?
p152
aVLike the mayor of São Paulo who's banned advertising billboards,
p153
aVor the many cities like San Francisco
p154
aVputting in infrastructures for electric cars.
p155
aVYou can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world.
p156
aVSome, I think some of the bankers
p157
aVwho have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.
p158
aVBut ask yourselves: What will be the biggest sectors of the economy
p159
aVin 10, 20, 30 years time? It won't be the ones lining up for handouts,
p160
aVlike cars and aerospace and so on.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe biggest sector, by far, will be health \u2014
p163
aValready 18 percent of the American economy,
p164
aVpredicted to grow to 30, even 40 percent by mid-century.
p165
aVElder care, child care, already much bigger employers than cars.
p166
aVEducation: six, seven, eight percent of the economy and growing.
p167
aVEnvironmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs,
p168
aVthey're all pointing to a very different kind of economy
p169
aVwhich isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks,
p170
aVand it's founded above all on care, on relationships,
p171
aVon what people do to other people, often one to one,
p172
aVrather than simply selling them a product.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd I think that what connects the challenge for civil society,
p175
aVthe challenge for governments and the challenge for business now
p176
aVis, in a way, a very simple one, but quite a difficult one.
p177
aVWe know our societies have to radically change.
p178
aVWe know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis.
p179
aVBut we also know it's only through experiment
p180
aVthat we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city,
p181
aVhow to care for a much older population,
p182
aVhow to deal with drug addiction and so on.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd here's the problem.
p185
aVIn science, we do experiments systematically.
p186
aVOur societies now spend two, three, four percent of GDP
p187
aVto invest systematically in new discovery, in science, in technology,
p188
aVto fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions
p189
aVwhich illuminate gatherings like this.
p190
aVIt's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter
p191
aVthan they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are,
p192
aVbut they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did.
p193
aVAnd what's striking though,
p194
aVis that in society there's almost nothing comparable,
p195
aVno comparable investment,
p196
aVno systematic experiment, in the things capitalism isn't very good at,
p197
aVlike compassion, or empathy, or relationships or care.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, I didn't really understand that until I met this guy
p200
aVwho was then an 80-year-old, slightly shambolic man
p201
aVwho lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated.
p202
aVHe had helped shape Britain's post-war institutions,
p203
aVits welfare state, its economy,
p204
aVbut had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur,
p205
aVbecame an inventor of many, many different organizations.
p206
aVSome famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students,
p207
aVthe University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people
p208
aVteaching other older people,
p209
aVas well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines
p210
aVand schools for social entrepreneurs.
p211
aVAnd he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists.
p212
aa(lp213
VHe believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act,
p214
aVyou should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough
p215
aVand saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed
p216
aVthat he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer.
p217
aVAnd his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers,
p218
aVnot from a theory, but from experiment, and experiment involving the people
p219
aVwith the best intelligence on social needs,
p220
aVwhich were usually the people living with those needs.
p221
aVAnd he believed we live with others, we share the world with others
p222
aVand therefore our innovation must be done with others too,
p223
aVnot doing things at people, for them, and so on.
p224
aa(lp225
VNow, what he did didn't used to have a name,
p226
aVbut I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream.
p227
aVIt's what we do in the organization named after him
p228
aVwhere we try and invent, create, launch new ventures,
p229
aVwhether it's schools, web companies, health organizations and so on.
p230
aVAnd we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement
p231
aVof institutions working on social innovation,
p232
aVusing ideas from design or technology or community organizing
p233
aVto develop the germs of a future world, but through practice and through demonstration
p234
aVand not through theory.
p235
aVAnd they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA
p236
aVand across Europe.
p237
aVAnd they've been given new momentum by the crisis, by the need for better answers
p238
aVto joblessness, community breakdown and so on.
p239
aa(lp240
VSome of the ideas are strange.
p241
aVThese are complaints choirs.
p242
aVPeople come together to sing about the things that really bug them.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aVOthers are much more pragmatic: health coaches, learning mentors, job clubs.
p245
aVAnd some are quite structural, like social impact bonds
p246
aVwhere you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime
p247
aVor helping old people keep out of hospital,
p248
aVand you get paid back according to how successful your projects are.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow, the idea that all of this represents,
p251
aVI think, is rapidly becoming a common sense
p252
aVand part of how we respond to the crisis,
p253
aVrecognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress
p254
aVas well as technological progress.
p255
aVThere were big health innovation funds
p256
aVlaunched earlier this year in this country,
p257
aVas well as a public service innovation lab.
p258
aVAcross northern Europe, many governments
p259
aVnow have innovation laboratories within them.
p260
aVAnd just a few months ago, President Obama
p261
aVlaunched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd what people are beginning to ask is:
p264
aVSurely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent,
p265
aVof our GDP, of our economy,
p266
aVwhat if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending
p267
aVinto social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education,
p268
aVnew ways of helping the disabled?
p269
aVPerhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society
p270
aVto those we've had in the economy and in technology.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd if, a generation or two ago, the big challenges
p273
aVwere ones like getting a man on the moon,
p274
aVperhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now
p275
aVare ones like eliminating child malnutrition, stopping trafficking,
p276
aVor one, I think closer to home for America or Europe,
p277
aVwhy don't we set ourselves the goal
p278
aVof achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens.
p279
aVNow those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade,
p280
aVbut only with radical and systematic experiment,
p281
aVnot just with technologies, but also with lifestyles and culture
p282
aVand policies and institutions too.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism.
p285
aVI think what this is all about, this whole movement
p286
aVwhich is growing from the margins, remains quite small.
p287
aVNothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont.
p288
aVWhat it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social.
p289
aVIt's already immersed in social networks.
p290
aVIt will become more involved in social investment, and social care
p291
aVand in industries where the value comes from what you do with others,
p292
aVnot just from what you sell to them,
p293
aVand from relationships as well as from consumption.
p294
aVBut interestingly too, it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism
p295
aVabout how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation
p296
aVinto society, trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work.
p297
aa(lp298
VNow, I think this future will be quite surprising to many people.
p299
aVIn recent years, a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won.
p300
aVHistory was over
p301
aVand society would inevitably have to take second place to economy.
p302
aVBut I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today
p303
aVand how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago,
p304
aVjust after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France.
p305
aa(lp306
VThen, people said monarchy dominated everywhere
p307
aVbecause it was rooted in human nature.
p308
aVWe were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy.
p309
aVJust as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism
p310
aVsay it's rooted in human nature,
p311
aVonly now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on.
p312
aVThen monarchy had seen off its big challenger, mass democracy,
p313
aVwhich was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment,
p314
aVjust as capitalism has seen off socialism.
p315
aVEven Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse
p316
aVthan being exploited by multinational capitalism
p317
aVis not being exploited by multinational capitalism.
p318
aVAnd whereas then monarchies, palaces and forts dominated every city skyline
p319
aVand looked permanent and confident,
p320
aVtoday it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city.
p321
aa(lp322
VI'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades
p323
aVand string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost,
p324
aVthough that might be quite tempting.
p325
aVBut I do think we're on the verge of a period when,
p326
aVjust as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too,
p327
aVthe central position of finance capital is going to come to an end,
p328
aVand it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society,
p329
aVtransformed from being a master into a servant,
p330
aVa servant to the productive economy and of human needs.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd as that happens,
p333
aVwe will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism,
p334
aVwhich is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks,
p335
aVit's not a self-sufficient system.
p336
aVIt depends on other systems,
p337
aVon ecology, on family, on community,
p338
aVand if these aren't replenished, capitalism suffers too.
p339
aVAnd our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate.
p340
aVIt's not just competitive, it's also caring.
p341
aVBecause of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice.
p342
aa(lp343
VThe crisis is almost certainly deepening around us.
p344
aVIt will be worse at the end of this year,
p345
aVquite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today.
p346
aVBut this is one of those very rare moments
p347
aVwhen we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously
p348
aVto get back to where we were a year or two ago,
p349
aVand a very narrow idea of what the economy is for,
p350
aVor whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot
p351
aVand to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.
p352
aVThank you.

VOne morning, in the year 1957,
p5
aVthe neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield
p6
aVsaw himself like this,
p7
aVa weird freak with huge hands,
p8
aVhuge mouth,
p9
aVand a tiny bottom.
p10
aVActually this creature
p11
aVis the result of the Penfield research.
p12
aVHe named it homunculus.
p13
aVBasically the homunculus is
p14
aVthe visualization of a human being
p15
aVwhere each part of the body is proportional
p16
aVto the surface it takes in the brain.
p17
aVSo, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.
p18
aVIt's you. It's me.
p19
aVIt's our invisible reality.
p20
aVThis visualization could explain, for example,
p21
aVwhy newborns, or smokers,
p22
aVput, instinctively, their fingers in the mouth.
p23
aVUnfortunately it doesn't explain why
p24
aVso many designers remain mainly interested
p25
aVin designing chairs.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo anyway, even if I do not understand science entirely,
p28
aVfor my design I essentially refer to it.
p29
aVI'm fascinated by its ability to
p30
aVdeeply investigate the human being,
p31
aVits way of working, its way of feeling.
p32
aVAnd it really helps me to understand
p33
aVhow we see, how we hear,
p34
aVhow we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us.
p35
aVIt's a great tool for me
p36
aVto understand what could be our real needs.
p37
aa(lp38
VMarketing people have never been able to do that.
p39
aVMarketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies.
p40
aVMarketing creates user groups.
p41
aVAnd scientists, amidst complexity,
p42
aVamidst fluctuation and uniqueness.
p43
aVWhat could be our real needs?
p44
aVMaybe the silence.
p45
aVIn our daily life we are continuously disturbed by
p46
aVaggressive sounds.
p47
aVAnd you know all those kind of sound puts us
p48
aVin a kind of stressful state,
p49
aVand prevent us from being quiet and focused.
p50
aVSo I wanted to create a kind of
p51
aVsound filter,
p52
aVable to preserve ourselves from noise pollution.
p53
aVBut I didn't want it to make it by
p54
aVisolating people, without any earmuffs
p55
aVor those kind of things.
p56
aVOr neither with including complex technology.
p57
aVI just wanted to, using the complexity
p58
aVand the technology of the brain, of the human brain.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I worked with white noise.
p61
aVdB is basically \u2014
p62
aVdB is the name of the product,
p63
aVbasically a white noise diffuser.
p64
aVThis is white noise.
p65
aVThe white noise is the sum of all frequencies
p66
aVthat are audible by the human being,
p67
aVbrought to the same intensity.
p68
aVAnd this noise is like a "shhhhhhhhhhhhh," like that.
p69
aVAnd this noise is the most neutral.
p70
aVIt is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.
p71
aVSo when you hear this sound
p72
aVyou feel like a kind of shelter,
p73
aVpreserved from noise pollution.
p74
aVAnd when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it.
p75
aVAnd do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound.
p76
aVIt seems to be magic.
p77
aVBut it is just physiology. It's just in your brain.
p78
aVAnd in mine, I hope.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo in order to make this white noise
p81
aVa little bit active and reactive,
p82
aVI create a ball, a rolling ball
p83
aVable to analyze and find
p84
aVwhere does aggressive sound come from,
p85
aVand roll, at home or at work,
p86
aVtowards aggressive noise,
p87
aVand emits white noise in order to neutralize it.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVIt works.
p90
aVYou feel the effect of the white noise?
p91
aVIt's too in silence.
p92
aVIf you make some noise you can feel the effect.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo even if this object,
p95
aVeven if this product includes some technology,
p96
aVit includes some speakers, it includes some microphones
p97
aVand some electronic devices,
p98
aVthis object is not a very smart object.
p99
aVAnd I don't want to make a very smart object.
p100
aVI don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot.
p101
aVI want to create an object like you and me.
p102
aVSo, definitely not perfect.
p103
aVSo imagine, for instance, you are at home.
p104
aVA loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend.
p105
aVYou shout. You say, "Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?"
p106
aVAnd dB will probably roll toward you.
p107
aVAnd turning around you is "shhhhhhh," like that.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVDefinitely not perfect. So you would probably
p110
aVshut it, at this point.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VAnyway, in this same kind of approach,
p114
aVI designed K.
p115
aVK is a daylight receiver transmitter.
p116
aVSo this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk,
p117
aVor on your piano, where you are supposed
p118
aVto spend most of your time in the day.
p119
aVAnd this object will be
p120
aVable to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day,
p121
aVand able to give you the quantity of light you need.
p122
aVThis object is completely covered by
p123
aVfiber opticals.
p124
aVAnd the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure,
p125
aVbut creates the idea of an
p126
aVeye sensibility of the object.
p127
aVI want, by this design
p128
aVfeel, when you see it,
p129
aVyou see, instinctively,
p130
aVthis object seems to be very sensitive,
p131
aVvery reactive.
p132
aVAnd this object knows, better than you
p133
aVand probably before you, what you really need.
p134
aVYou have to know that the lack of daylight
p135
aVcan provoke some
p136
aVproblem of energy, or problem of libido.
p137
aVSo, a huge problem.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VMost of the projects I work on \u2014
p141
aVI live in collaboration with scientists.
p142
aVI'm just a designer. So I need them.
p143
aVSo there can be some biologists,
p144
aVpsychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on.
p145
aVAnd I submit them, my intuitions,
p146
aVmy hypothesis, my first ideas.
p147
aVAnd they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible.
p148
aVAnd together we improve the original concept.
p149
aVAnd we build the project to the end.
p150
aVAnd this kind of relationship between designer and scientist
p151
aVstarted when I was at school.
p152
aa(lp153
VIndeed in my studies I was a guinea pig
p154
aVfor a pharmaceutical industry.
p155
aVAnd the irony for me was
p156
aVof course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress.
p157
aVI just do that to make money.
p158
aVAnyway, this project, or this experience,
p159
aVmake me start a new project on the design of medicine.
p160
aVYou have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills
p161
aVis not taken correctly.
p162
aVSo even if the active constituents
p163
aVin pharmaceuticals made constant progress
p164
aVin terms of chemistry, target of stability,
p165
aVthe behavior of the patients
p166
aVgoes more and more unstable.
p167
aVSo we took too many of them.
p168
aVWe took irregular dosage.
p169
aVWe do not follow instructions. And so on.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo I wanted to create a
p172
aVnew kind of medicine,
p173
aVin order to create a new kind of relationship
p174
aVbetween the patient and the treatment.
p175
aVSo I turned traditional pills into this.
p176
aVI'm going to give you some example.
p177
aVThis one is an antibiotic.
p178
aVAnd its purpose is to help patient
p179
aVto go to the end of the treatment.
p180
aVAnd the concept is to
p181
aVcreate a kind of onion,
p182
aVa kind of structure in layers.
p183
aVSo, you start with the darkest one.
p184
aVAnd you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment.
p185
aVAnd you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection.
p186
aVSo the first day, this is the big one.
p187
aVAnd you have to peel and eat one layer a day.
p188
aVAnd your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer.
p189
aVAnd you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day.
p190
aVAnd you follow the treatment like that,
p191
aVto the end of the treatment.
p192
aVAnd here you can get the white core.
p193
aVAnd it means, right, you are in the recovery.
p194
aV(Applause) Thank you.
p195
aa(lp196
VThis one is a "third lung,"
p197
aVa pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment.
p198
aVI designed it to help kids to follow the treatment.
p199
aVSo the idea of this one is to create
p200
aVa relationship between the patient of the treatment
p201
aVbut a relationship of dependency.
p202
aVBut in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.
p203
aVThis is, the kids will feel
p204
aVthe therapeutic object needs him.
p205
aVSo the idea is, all night long
p206
aVthe elastic skin of the third lung
p207
aVwill slowly inflate itself,
p208
aVincluding air and molecules, for sure.
p209
aVAnd when the kids wake up,
p210
aVhe can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth,
p211
aVand breathe the air it contains.
p212
aVSo by this way,
p213
aVthe kid, to take care of himself,
p214
aVis to take care of this living object.
p215
aVAnd he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment,
p216
aVas the asthma treatment needs him.
p217
aV(Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VIn this guise of living object approach,
p220
aVI like the idea of a kind of invisible design,
p221
aVas if the function of the object
p222
aVexists in a kind of invisible field
p223
aVjust around the objects themselves.
p224
aVWe could talk about a kind of soul,
p225
aVof a ghost accompanying them.
p226
aVAnd almost a kind of poltergeist effect.
p227
aVSo when a passive object like this one seems to be alive,
p228
aVbecause it is \u2014 woosh \u2014 starting to move.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd I remember an exhibition design
p231
aVI made for John Maeda,
p232
aVand for the Fondation Cartier in Paris.
p233
aVAnd John Maeda was supposed to show
p234
aVseveral graphic animations in this exhibition.
p235
aVAnd my idea for this exhibition design was to create
p236
aVa real pong game, like this one.
p237
aVAnd the idea was to create some self-moving benches
p238
aVin the main exhibition room.
p239
aVSo the living benches would be exactly like the ball.
p240
aVAnd John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, "Okay let's go."
p241
aVI remember the day of the opening.
p242
aVI was a little bit late.
p243
aVWhen I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches
p244
aVin the exhibition room, John was just beside me,
p245
aVand was like, "Hmm. Hmm."
p246
aVAnd he told me, after a long silence,
p247
aV"I wonder, Mathieu, if
p248
aVpeople won't be more fascinated by your benches
p249
aVthan by my videos."
p250
aV(Laughter)
p251
aVIt would be a great honor, a great compliment for me,
p252
aVif he hadn't decided to take all them off
p253
aVtwo hours before the opening.
p254
aVSo, huge tragedy.
p255
aa(lp256
VI guess you won't be surprised if I tell you
p257
aVthat Pinocchio is one of my great influences.
p258
aVPinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one.
p259
aVBecause it is a kind of object with a conscience,
p260
aVable to be modified by its surroundings,
p261
aVand able to modify it as well.
p262
aVThe other great influence is the mine's canary.
p263
aVIn coal mines, this canary
p264
aVwas supposed to be close to the miners.
p265
aVAnd it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died.
p266
aVSo this canary was a living alarm,
p267
aVand a very efficient one.
p268
aVA very natural technology,
p269
aVin order to say to the miners,
p270
aV"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency."
p271
aVSo it's, for me, a great product.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd I tried to design a kind of canary.
p274
aVAndrea is one.
p275
aVAndrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses
p276
aVfrom air, contaminated indoor air.
p277
aVSo it uses some plants to do this job,
p278
aVselected for their gas-filtering ability.
p279
aVYou have to know, or you probably already know,
p280
aVthat indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one.
p281
aVSo while I'm talking to you,
p282
aVthe seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some
p283
aVinvisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter)
p284
aVSo you are currently breathing formaldehyde.
p285
aVIt's the same for me with the carpet.
p286
aVAnd this is exactly the same at home.
p287
aVBecause all the product we get constantly give away
p288
aVthe volatile component of which they're made of.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo let's have a look at your home.
p291
aVSo your sofa, your plastic chair,
p292
aVyour kid's toys
p293
aVgive their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic.
p294
aVThis is the reason why
p295
aVI created, with David Edward,
p296
aVa scientist of Harvard University,
p297
aVan object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants.
p298
aVBut the idea is to force
p299
aVthe air to go in the effective part of the plants.
p300
aVBecause the roots of the plant are not very effective.
p301
aVBill Wolverton from NASA
p302
aVanalyzed it cleverly in the '70s.
p303
aVSo the idea is to create an object
p304
aVable to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed
p305
aVat the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant.
p306
aVSo this is the final object.
p307
aVIt will be launched next September.
p308
aV(Applause)
p309
aa(lp310
VThis one is kind of the same approach
p311
aVbecause I include, in a product
p312
aVlike Andrea, some plants.
p313
aVAnd in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability.
p314
aVAnd it includes some fishes as well.
p315
aVBut here, unlike Andrea,
p316
aVhere are supposed to be eaten.
p317
aVIndeed, this object is a domestic farm,
p318
aVfor fishes and green.
p319
aVSo the idea of this object
p320
aVis to be able to get at home
p321
aVvery local food.
p322
aVThe locavores
p323
aVused to get food
p324
aVtaken in a radius of 100 miles.
p325
aVLocal River is able to provide you
p326
aVfood directly in your living room.
p327
aVSo the principle of this object
p328
aVis to create an ecosystem
p329
aVcalled aquaponics.
p330
aVAnd the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish,
p331
aVby a water pump, feeds the plants above.
p332
aVAnd the plants will filter, by the roots,
p333
aVthe dirty water of the fish.
p334
aVAfter, it goes back into the fish tank.
p335
aa(lp336
VAfter that you have two options.
p337
aVOr you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.
p338
aVAmazing channel.
p339
aVOr you start fishing.
p340
aVAnd you make some sushis with a fish
p341
aVand the aromatic plants above.
p342
aVBecause you can grow some potatoes.
p343
aVNo, not potatoes, but tomatoes,
p344
aVaromatic plants and so on.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo now we can breathe safely.
p347
aVNow we can eat local food.
p348
aVNow we can be treated by smart medicine.
p349
aVNow we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm
p350
aVwith daylight.
p351
aVBut it was important to create a perfect place,
p352
aVso I tried to,
p353
aVin order to work and create.
p354
aVSo I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris,
p355
aVa very stimulative, brain-stimulative office.
p356
aVI wanted to create a perfect place
p357
aVwhere you can work and play,
p358
aVand where your body and your brain can work together.
p359
aa(lp360
VSo, in this office,
p361
aVyou do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician.
p362
aVYour seat, your sleep and your play
p363
aVon a big geodesic island made of leather.
p364
aVSee, like this one?
p365
aVIn this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper,
p366
aVbut you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave,
p367
aVlike a prehistoric scientist.
p368
aVSo you, like that, can make some sport during your work.
p369
aVIn this office
p370
aVyou do not need to go out
p371
aVin order to be in contact with nature.
p372
aVYou include, directly, the nature in the floor of the office.
p373
aVYou can see it there.
p374
aa(lp375
VThis is an inspiration image
p376
aVto lead this project of the office.
p377
aVIt really helped me to design it.
p378
aVI never show it to my client. He would be so afraid.
p379
aV(Laughter)
p380
aVJust for my workshop.
p381
aVI guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was.
p382
aVBut it's maybe the conviction
p383
aVas monkey and homunculus we are.
p384
aVAll of us need to be considered according to our real nature.
p385
aVThank you very much.
p386
aV(Applause)

With its Lucite lines, lush green interior and rounded corners, the <a href=\\"http://www.mathieulehanneur.fr/projet_gb.php?projet=90\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Andrea purifier</a>  featured in the exhibit resembles a mash-up of a terrarium and an iMac, but its function is less visible.

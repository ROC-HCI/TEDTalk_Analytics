V"Mom, who are these people?"
p5
aVIt was an innocent question from my young daughter Alia
p6
aVaround the time when she was three.
p7
aVWe were walking along with my husband
p8
aVin one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.
p9
aVAlia was peering at a huge poster standing tall in the middle of the mall.
p10
aVIt featured the three rulers of the United Arab Emirates.
p11
aVAs she tucked in my side,
p12
aVI bent down and explained that these were the rulers of the UAE
p13
aVwho had worked hard to develop their nation
p14
aVand preserve its unity.
p15
aVShe asked, "Mom, why is it that here where we live,
p16
aVand back in Lebanon, where grandma and grandpa live,
p17
aVwe never see the pictures of powerful women on the walls?
p18
aVIs it because women are not important?"
p19
aa(lp20
VThis is probably the hardest question I've had to answer in my years as a parent
p21
aVand in my 16-plus years of professional life, for that matter.
p22
aVI had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,
p23
aVthe younger of two daughters to a very hard-working pilot
p24
aVand director of operations for the Lebanese Airlines
p25
aVand a super-supportive stay-at-home mom and grandma.
p26
aVMy father had encouraged my sister and I to pursue our education
p27
aVeven though our culture emphasized at the time
p28
aVthat it was sons and not daughters who should be professionally motivated.
p29
aVI was one of very few girls of my generation
p30
aVwho left home at 18 to study abroad.
p31
aVMy father didn't have a son,
p32
aVand so I, in a sense, became his.
p33
aa(lp34
VFast-forward a couple of decades, and I hope I didn't do too badly
p35
aVin making my father proud of his would-be son.
p36
aVAs I got my Bachelor's and PhD in electrical engineering,
p37
aVdid R&D in the UK, then consulting in the Middle East,
p38
aVI have always been in male-dominated environments.
p39
aVTruth be told, I have never found a role model I could truly identify with.
p40
aVMy mother's generation wasn't into professional leadership.
p41
aVThere were some encouraging men along the way,
p42
aVbut none knew the demands and pressures I was facing,
p43
aVpressures that got particularly acute when I had my own two beautiful children.
p44
aVAnd although Western women love to give us poor, oppressed Arab women advice,
p45
aVthey live different lives with different constraints.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo Arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models.
p48
aVWe have had to juggle more than Arab men,
p49
aVand we have had to face more cultural rigidity than Western women.
p50
aVAs a result, I would like to think that we poor, oppressed women
p51
aVactually have some useful, certainly hard-earned lessons to share,
p52
aVlessons that might turn out useful
p53
aVfor anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world.
p54
aVHere are three of mine.
p55
aa(lp56
V["Convert their sh*t into your fuel."]
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VThere is this word that everybody is touting as the key to success:
p63
aVresilience.
p64
aVWell, what exactly is resilience, and how do you develop it?
p65
aVI believe resilience is simply the ability to transform shit into fuel.
p66
aa(lp67
VIn my previous job, well before my current firm,
p68
aVI was working with a man we will call John.
p69
aVI had teamed up with John and was working hard,
p70
aVhoping he would notice how great I was
p71
aVand that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm.
p72
aVI was, in addition to delivering on my consulting projects,
p73
aVwriting passionately on the topic of women economic empowerment.
p74
aVOne day, I got to present my research to a roomful of MBA students.
p75
aVJohn was part of the audience
p76
aVlistening for the first time to the details of my study.
p77
aVAs I proceeded with my presentation,
p78
aVI could see John in the corner of my eye.
p79
aVHe had turned a dark shade of pink
p80
aVand had slid under his chair in apparent shame.
p81
aa(lp82
VI finished my presentation to an applauding audience
p83
aVand we rushed out and jumped into the car.
p84
aVThere he exploded.
p85
aV"What you did up there was unacceptable!
p86
aVYou are a consultant, not an activist!"
p87
aVI said, "John, I don't understand.
p88
aVI presented a couple of gender parity indices,
p89
aVand some conclusions about the Arab world.
p90
aVYes, we do happen to be today at the bottom of the index,
p91
aVbut what is it that I said or presented that was not factual?"
p92
aa(lp93
VTo which he replied, "The whole premise of your study is wrong.
p94
aVWhat you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society."
p95
aVHe paused, then added,
p96
aV"When women have children, their place is in the home."
p97
aa(lp98
VTime stood still for a long while,
p99
aVand all I could think and repeat in the chaos of my brain was:
p100
aV"You can forget about that partnership, Leila.
p101
aVIt's just never going to happen."
p102
aVIt took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications,
p103
aVbut once I did, I reached three conclusions.
p104
aVOne, that these were his issues,
p105
aVhis complexes.
p106
aVThere may be many like him in our society,
p107
aVbut I would never let their issues become mine.
p108
aVTwo, that I needed another sponsor, and fast.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VI got one, by the way, and boy, was he great.
p113
aVAnd three, that I would get to show John what women with children can do.
p114
aVI apply this lesson equally well to my personal life.
p115
aVAs I have progressed in my career,
p116
aVI have received many words of encouragement,
p117
aVbut I have also often been met by women, men and couples
p118
aVwho have clearly had an issue with my husband and I
p119
aVhaving chosen the path of a dual-career couple.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo you get this well-meaning couple
p122
aVwho tells you straight out at a family gathering
p123
aVor at a friends gathering,
p124
aVthat, come on, you must know you're not a great mom,
p125
aVgiven how much you're investing in your career, right?
p126
aVI would lie if I said these words didn't hurt.
p127
aVMy children are the most precious thing to me,
p128
aVand the thought that I could be failing them in any way is intolerable.
p129
aVBut just like I did with John,
p130
aVI quickly reminded myself that these were their issues,
p131
aVtheir complexes.
p132
aVSo instead of replying,
p133
aVI gave back one of my largest smiles
p134
aVas I saw, in flashing light,
p135
aVthe following sign in my mind's eye.
p136
aa(lp137
V[Be happy, it drives people crazy.]
p138
aa(lp139
V(Applause)
p140
aa(lp141
VYou see, as a young woman in these situations, you have two options.
p142
aVYou can either decide to internalize these negative messages
p143
aVthat are being thrown at you,
p144
aVto let them make you feel like a failure,
p145
aVlike success is way too hard to ever achieve,
p146
aVor you can choose to see that others' negativity is their own issue,
p147
aVand instead transform it into your own personal fuel.
p148
aVI have learned to always go for option two,
p149
aVand I have found that it has taken me from strength to strength.
p150
aVAnd it's true what they say:
p151
aVsuccess is the best revenge.
p152
aa(lp153
VSome women in the Middle East
p154
aVare lucky enough to be married to someone supportive of their career.
p155
aVCorrection: I should say "smart enough,"
p156
aVbecause who you marry is your own choice,
p157
aVand you'd better marry someone supportive if you plan to have a long career.
p158
aVStill today, the Arab man is not an equal contributor in the home.
p159
aVIt's simply not expected by our society,
p160
aVand even frowned upon as not very manly.
p161
aVAs for the Arab woman, our society still assumes
p162
aVthat her primary source of happiness should be the happiness and prosperity
p163
aVof her children and husband.
p164
aVShe mostly exists for her family.
p165
aVThings are changing, but it will take time.
p166
aa(lp167
VFor now, it means that the professional Arab woman
p168
aVhas to somehow maintain the perfect home,
p169
aVmake sure that her children's every need is being taken care of
p170
aVand manage her demanding career.
p171
aVTo achieve this, I have found the hard way
p172
aVthat you need to apply your hard-earned professional skills to your personal life.
p173
aVYou need to work your life.
p174
aa(lp175
VHere is how I do this in my personal life.
p176
aVOne thing to know about the Middle East
p177
aVis that nearly every family has access to affordable domestic help.
p178
aVThe challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively.
p179
aVJust like I would in my business life, I have based the selection
p180
aVof who would support me with my children while I'm at work
p181
aVon a strong referral.
p182
aVCristina had worked for four years with my sister
p183
aVand the quality of her work was well-established.
p184
aVShe is now an integral member of our family,
p185
aVhaving been with us since Alia was six months old.
p186
aVShe makes sure that the house is running smoothly while I'm at work,
p187
aVand I make sure to empower her
p188
aVin the most optimal conditions for her and my children,
p189
aVjust like I would my best talent at work.
p190
aVThis lesson applies whatever your childcare situation,
p191
aVwhether an au pair, nursery,
p192
aVpart-time nanny that you share with someone else.
p193
aVChoose very carefully, and empower.
p194
aa(lp195
VIf you look at my calendar,
p196
aVyou will see every working day
p197
aVone and a half hours from 7pm to 8:30pm UAE time
p198
aVblocked and called "family time."
p199
aVThis is sacred time.
p200
aVI have done this ever since Alia was a baby.
p201
aVI do everything in my power to protect this time
p202
aVso that I can be home by then to spend quality time with my children,
p203
aVasking them about their day,
p204
aVchecking up on homework, reading them a bedtime story
p205
aVand giving them lots of kisses and cuddles.
p206
aVIf I'm traveling, in whatever the time zone,
p207
aVI use Skype to connect with my children even if I am miles away.
p208
aVOur son Burhan is five years old,
p209
aVand he's learning to read and do basic maths.
p210
aa(lp211
VHere's another confession:
p212
aVI have found that our daughter is actually more successful
p213
aVat teaching him these skills than I am.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VIt started as a game, but Alia loves playing teacher to her little brother,
p218
aVand I have found that these sessions actually improve Burhan's literacy,
p219
aVincrease Alia's sense of responsibility,
p220
aVand strengthen the bonding between them,
p221
aVa win-win all around.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe successful Arab women I know
p224
aVhave each found their unique approach to working their life
p225
aVas they continue to shoulder
p226
aVthe lion's share of responsibility in the home.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut this is not just about surviving in your dual role
p229
aVas a career woman and mother.
p230
aVThis is also about being in the present.
p231
aVWhen I am with my children,
p232
aVI try to leave work out of our lives.
p233
aVInstead of worrying about how many minutes I can spend with them every day,
p234
aVI focus on turning these minutes into memorable moments,
p235
aVmoments where I'm seeing my kids,
p236
aVhearing them, connecting with them.
p237
aa(lp238
V["Join forces, don't compete."]
p239
aa(lp240
VArab women of my generation have not been very visible
p241
aVin the public eye as they grew up.
p242
aVThis explains, I think, to some extent,
p243
aVwhy you find so few women in politics in the Arab world.
p244
aVThe upside of this, however,
p245
aVis that we have spent a lot of time
p246
aVdeveloping a social skill behind the scenes,
p247
aVin coffee shops, in living rooms,
p248
aVon the phone,
p249
aVa social skill that is very important to success:
p250
aVnetworking.
p251
aVI would say the average Arab woman
p252
aVhas a large network of friends and acquaintances.
p253
aVThe majority of those are also women.
p254
aa(lp255
VIn the West, it seems like ambitious women often compare themselves to other women
p256
aVhoping to be noticed as the most successful woman in the room.
p257
aVThis leads to the much-spoken-about competitive behavior
p258
aVbetween professional women.
p259
aVIf there's only room for one woman at the top,
p260
aVthen you can't make room for others, much less lift them up.
p261
aa(lp262
VArab women, generally speaking,
p263
aVhave not fallen for this psychological trap.
p264
aVFaced with a patriarchal society,
p265
aVthey have found that by helping each other out,
p266
aVall benefit.
p267
aa(lp268
VIn my previous job, I was the most senior woman in the Middle East,
p269
aVso one could think that investing in my network of female colleagues
p270
aVcouldn't bring many benefits
p271
aVand that I should instead invest my time
p272
aVdeveloping my relationships with male seniors and peers.
p273
aVYet two of my biggest breaks came through the support of other women.
p274
aVIt was the head of marketing who initially suggested
p275
aVI be considered as a young global leader to the World Economic Forum.
p276
aVShe was familiar with my media engagements and my publications,
p277
aVand when she was asked to voice her opinion,
p278
aVshe highlighted my name.
p279
aVIt was a young consultant, a Saudi lady and friend,
p280
aVwho helped me sell my first project in Saudi Arabia,
p281
aVa market I was finding hard to gain traction in as a woman.
p282
aVShe introduced me to a client,
p283
aVand that introduction led to the first of very many projects for me in Saudi.
p284
aVToday, I have two senior women on my team,
p285
aVand I see making them successful as key to my own success.
p286
aVWomen continue to advance in the world,
p287
aVnot fast enough, but we're moving.
p288
aa(lp289
VThe Arab world, too, is making progress, despite many recent setbacks.
p290
aVJust this year, the UAE appointed five new female ministers to its cabinet,
p291
aVfor a total of eight female ministers.
p292
aVThat's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,
p293
aVand more than many developed countries can claim.
p294
aVThis is today my daughter Alia's favorite picture.
p295
aVThis is the result, no doubt, of great leadership,
p296
aVbut it is also the result of strong Arab women
p297
aVnot giving up and continuously pushing the boundaries.
p298
aVIt is the result of Arab women deciding every day like me
p299
aVto convert shit into fuel,
p300
aVto work their life to keep work out of their life,
p301
aVand to join forces and not compete.
p302
aa(lp303
VAs I look to the future,
p304
aVmy hopes for my daughter when she stands on this stage
p305
aVsome 20, 30 years from now
p306
aVare that she be as proud to call herself her mother's daughter
p307
aVas her father's daughter.
p308
aa(lp309
VMy hopes for my son
p310
aVare that by then, the expression "her mother's son" or "mama's boy"
p311
aVwould have taken on a completely different meaning.
p312
aa(lp313
VThank you.
p314

VA few months ago
p5
aVthe Nobel Prize in physics
p6
aVwas awarded to two teams of astronomers
p7
aVfor a discovery that has been hailed
p8
aVas one of the most important
p9
aVastronomical observations ever.
p10
aVAnd today, after briefly describing what they found,
p11
aVI'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework
p12
aVfor explaining their discovery,
p13
aVnamely the possibility
p14
aVthat way beyond the Earth,
p15
aVthe Milky Way and other distant galaxies,
p16
aVwe may find that our universe
p17
aVis not the only universe,
p18
aVbut is instead
p19
aVpart of a vast complex of universes
p20
aVthat we call the multiverse.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow the idea of a multiverse is a strange one.
p23
aVI mean, most of us were raised to believe
p24
aVthat the word "universe" means everything.
p25
aVAnd I say most of us with forethought,
p26
aVas my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born.
p27
aVAnd last year I was holding her
p28
aVand I said, "Sophia,
p29
aVI love you more than anything in the universe."
p30
aVAnd she turned to me and said, "Daddy,
p31
aVuniverse or multiverse?"
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VBut barring such an anomalous upbringing,
p35
aVit is strange to imagine
p36
aVother realms separate from ours,
p37
aVmost with fundamentally different features,
p38
aVthat would rightly be called universes of their own.
p39
aVAnd yet,
p40
aVspeculative though the idea surely is,
p41
aVI aim to convince you
p42
aVthat there's reason for taking it seriously,
p43
aVas it just might be right.
p44
aVI'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.
p45
aVIn part one,
p46
aVI'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results
p47
aVand to highlight a profound mystery
p48
aVwhich those results revealed.
p49
aVIn part two,
p50
aVI'll offer a solution to that mystery.
p51
aVIt's based on an approach called string theory,
p52
aVand that's where the idea of the multiverse
p53
aVwill come into the story.
p54
aVFinally, in part three,
p55
aVI'm going to describe a cosmological theory
p56
aVcalled inflation,
p57
aVwhich will pull all the pieces of the story together.
p58
aa(lp59
VOkay, part one starts back in 1929
p60
aVwhen the great astronomer Edwin Hubble
p61
aVrealized that the distant galaxies
p62
aVwere all rushing away from us,
p63
aVestablishing that space itself is stretching,
p64
aVit's expanding.
p65
aVNow this was revolutionary.
p66
aVThe prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales
p67
aVthe universe was static.
p68
aVBut even so,
p69
aVthere was one thing that everyone was certain of:
p70
aVThe expansion must be slowing down.
p71
aVThat, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth
p72
aVslows the ascent of an apple tossed upward,
p73
aVthe gravitational pull
p74
aVof each galaxy on every other
p75
aVmust be slowing
p76
aVthe expansion of space.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow let's fast-forward to the 1990s
p79
aVwhen those two teams of astronomers
p80
aVI mentioned at the outset
p81
aVwere inspired by this reasoning
p82
aVto measure the rate
p83
aVat which the expansion has been slowing.
p84
aVAnd they did this
p85
aVby painstaking observations
p86
aVof numerous distant galaxies,
p87
aVallowing them to chart
p88
aVhow the expansion rate has changed over time.
p89
aVHere's the surprise:
p90
aVThey found that the expansion is not slowing down.
p91
aVInstead they found that it's speeding up,
p92
aVgoing faster and faster.
p93
aVThat's like tossing an apple upward
p94
aVand it goes up faster and faster.
p95
aVNow if you saw an apple do that,
p96
aVyou'd want to know why.
p97
aVWhat's pushing on it?
p98
aa(lp99
VSimilarly, the astronomers' results
p100
aVare surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize,
p101
aVbut they raised an analogous question.
p102
aVWhat force is driving all galaxies
p103
aVto rush away from every other
p104
aVat an ever-quickening speed?
p105
aVWell the most promising answer
p106
aVcomes from an old idea of Einstein's.
p107
aVYou see, we are all used to gravity
p108
aVbeing a force that does one thing,
p109
aVpulls objects together.
p110
aVBut in Einstein's theory of gravity,
p111
aVhis general theory of relativity,
p112
aVgravity can also push things apart.
p113
aa(lp114
VHow? Well according to Einstein's math,
p115
aVif space is uniformly filled
p116
aVwith an invisible energy,
p117
aVsort of like a uniform, invisible mist,
p118
aVthen the gravity generated by that mist
p119
aVwould be repulsive,
p120
aVrepulsive gravity,
p121
aVwhich is just what we need to explain the observations.
p122
aVBecause the repulsive gravity
p123
aVof an invisible energy in space \u2014
p124
aVwe now call it dark energy,
p125
aVbut I've made it smokey white here so you can see it \u2014
p126
aVits repulsive gravity
p127
aVwould cause each galaxy to push against every other,
p128
aVdriving expansion to speed up,
p129
aVnot slow down.
p130
aVAnd this explanation
p131
aVrepresents great progress.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut I promised you a mystery
p134
aVhere in part one.
p135
aVHere it is.
p136
aVWhen the astronomers worked out
p137
aVhow much of this dark energy
p138
aVmust be infusing space
p139
aVto account for the cosmic speed up,
p140
aVlook at what they found.
p141
aVThis number is small.
p142
aVExpressed in the relevant unit,
p143
aVit is spectacularly small.
p144
aVAnd the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.
p145
aVWe want this number
p146
aVto emerge from the laws of physics,
p147
aVbut so far no one has found a way to do that.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow you might wonder,
p150
aVshould you care?
p151
aVMaybe explaining this number
p152
aVis just a technical issue,
p153
aVa technical detail of interest to experts,
p154
aVbut of no relevance to anybody else.
p155
aVWell it surely is a technical detail,
p156
aVbut some details really matter.
p157
aVSome details provide
p158
aVwindows into uncharted realms of reality,
p159
aVand this peculiar number may be doing just that,
p160
aVas the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it
p161
aVinvokes the possibility of other universes \u2014
p162
aVan idea that naturally emerges from string theory,
p163
aVwhich takes me to part two: string theory.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo hold the mystery of the dark energy
p166
aVin the back of your mind
p167
aVas I now go on to tell you
p168
aVthree key things about string theory.
p169
aVFirst off, what is it?
p170
aVWell it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream
p171
aVof a unified theory of physics,
p172
aVa single overarching framework
p173
aVthat would be able to describe
p174
aVall the forces at work in the universe.
p175
aVAnd the central idea of string theory
p176
aVis quite straightforward.
p177
aVIt says that if you examine
p178
aVany piece of matter ever more finely,
p179
aVat first you'll find molecules
p180
aVand then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.
p181
aVBut the theory says that if you could probe smaller,
p182
aVmuch smaller than we can with existing technology,
p183
aVyou'd find something else inside these particles \u2014
p184
aVa little tiny vibrating filament of energy,
p185
aVa little tiny vibrating string.
p186
aVAnd just like the strings on a violin,
p187
aVthey can vibrate in different patterns
p188
aVproducing different musical notes.
p189
aVThese little fundamental strings,
p190
aVwhen they vibrate in different patterns,
p191
aVthey produce different kinds of particles \u2014
p192
aVso electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons,
p193
aVall other particles
p194
aVwould be united into a single framework,
p195
aVas they would all arise from vibrating strings.
p196
aVIt's a compelling picture,
p197
aVa kind of cosmic symphony,
p198
aVwhere all the richness
p199
aVthat we see in the world around us
p200
aVemerges from the music
p201
aVthat these little, tiny strings can play.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut there's a cost
p204
aVto this elegant unification,
p205
aVbecause years of research
p206
aVhave shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.
p207
aVIt has internal inconsistencies,
p208
aVunless we allow
p209
aVfor something wholly unfamiliar \u2014
p210
aVextra dimensions of space.
p211
aVThat is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space.
p212
aVAnd you can think about those
p213
aVas height, width and depth.
p214
aVBut string theory says that, on fantastically small scales,
p215
aVthere are additional dimensions
p216
aVcrumpled to a tiny size so small
p217
aVthat we have not detected them.
p218
aVBut even though the dimensions are hidden,
p219
aVthey would have an impact on things that we can observe
p220
aVbecause the shape of the extra dimensions
p221
aVconstrains how the strings can vibrate.
p222
aVAnd in string theory,
p223
aVvibration determines everything.
p224
aVSo particle masses, the strengths of forces,
p225
aVand most importantly, the amount of dark energy
p226
aVwould be determined
p227
aVby the shape of the extra dimensions.
p228
aVSo if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions,
p229
aVwe should be able to calculate these features,
p230
aVcalculate the amount of dark energy.
p231
aa(lp232
VThe challenge
p233
aVis we don't know
p234
aVthe shape of the extra dimensions.
p235
aVAll we have
p236
aVis a list of candidate shapes
p237
aVallowed by the math.
p238
aVNow when these ideas were first developed,
p239
aVthere were only about five different candidate shapes,
p240
aVso you can imagine
p241
aVanalyzing them one-by-one
p242
aVto determine if any yield
p243
aVthe physical features we observe.
p244
aVBut over time the list grew
p245
aVas researchers found other candidate shapes.
p246
aVFrom five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands \u2014
p247
aVA large, but still manageable, collection to analyze,
p248
aVsince after all,
p249
aVgraduate students need something to do.
p250
aVBut then the list continued to grow
p251
aVinto the millions and the billions, until today.
p252
aVThe list of candidate shapes
p253
aVhas soared to about 10 to the 500.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo, what to do?
p256
aVWell some researchers lost heart,
p257
aVconcluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions,
p258
aVeach giving rise to different physical features,
p259
aVstring theory would never make
p260
aVdefinitive, testable predictions.
p261
aVBut others turned this issue on its head,
p262
aVtaking us to the possibility of a multiverse.
p263
aVHere's the idea.
p264
aVMaybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other.
p265
aVEach is as real as every other,
p266
aVin the sense
p267
aVthat there are many universes,
p268
aVeach with a different shape, for the extra dimensions.
p269
aVAnd this radical proposal
p270
aVhas a profound impact on this mystery:
p271
aVthe amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.
p272
aa(lp273
VBecause you see,
p274
aVif there are other universes,
p275
aVand if those universes
p276
aVeach have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions,
p277
aVthen the physical features of each universe will be different,
p278
aVand in particular,
p279
aVthe amount of dark energy in each universe
p280
aVwill be different.
p281
aVWhich means that the mystery
p282
aVof explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured
p283
aVwould take on a wholly different character.
p284
aVIn this context,
p285
aVthe laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy
p286
aVbecause there isn't just one number,
p287
aVthere are many numbers.
p288
aVWhich means
p289
aVwe have been asking the wrong question.
p290
aVIt's that the right question to ask is,
p291
aVwhy do we humans find ourselves in a universe
p292
aVwith a particular amount of dark energy we've measured
p293
aVinstead of any of the other possibilities
p294
aVthat are out there?
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd that's a question on which we can make headway.
p297
aVBecause those universes
p298
aVthat have much more dark energy than ours,
p299
aVwhenever matter tries to clump into galaxies,
p300
aVthe repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong
p301
aVthat it blows the clump apart
p302
aVand galaxies don't form.
p303
aVAnd in those universes that have much less dark energy,
p304
aVwell they collapse back on themselves so quickly
p305
aVthat, again, galaxies don't form.
p306
aVAnd without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets
p307
aVand no chance
p308
aVfor our form of life
p309
aVto exist in those other universes.
p310
aa(lp311
VSo we find ourselves in a universe
p312
aVwith the particular amount of dark energy we've measured
p313
aVsimply because our universe has conditions
p314
aVhospitable to our form of life.
p315
aVAnd that would be that.
p316
aVMystery solved,
p317
aVmultiverse found.
p318
aVNow some find this explanation unsatisfying.
p319
aVWe're used to physics
p320
aVgiving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.
p321
aVBut the point is,
p322
aVif the feature you're observing
p323
aVcan and does take on
p324
aVa wide variety of different values
p325
aVacross the wider landscape of reality,
p326
aVthen thinking one explanation
p327
aVfor a particular value
p328
aVis simply misguided.
p329
aa(lp330
VAn early example
p331
aVcomes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler
p332
aVwho was obsessed with understanding
p333
aVa different number \u2014
p334
aVwhy the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.
p335
aVAnd he worked for decades trying to explain this number,
p336
aVbut he never succeeded, and we know why.
p337
aVKepler was asking
p338
aVthe wrong question.
p339
aa(lp340
VWe now know that there are many planets
p341
aVat a wide variety of different distances from their host stars.
p342
aVSo hoping that the laws of physics
p343
aVwill explain one particular number, 93 million miles,
p344
aVwell that is simply wrongheaded.
p345
aVInstead the right question to ask is,
p346
aVwhy do we humans find ourselves on a planet
p347
aVat this particular distance,
p348
aVinstead of any of the other possibilities?
p349
aVAnd again, that's a question we can answer.
p350
aVThose planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun
p351
aVwould be so hot
p352
aVthat our form of life wouldn't exist.
p353
aVAnd those planets that are much farther away from the star,
p354
aVwell they're so cold
p355
aVthat, again, our form of life would not take hold.
p356
aVSo we find ourselves
p357
aVon a planet at this particular distance
p358
aVsimply because it yields conditions
p359
aVvital to our form of life.
p360
aVAnd when it comes to planets and their distances,
p361
aVthis clearly is the right kind of reasoning.
p362
aVThe point is,
p363
aVwhen it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain,
p364
aVit may also be the right kind of reasoning.
p365
aa(lp366
VOne key difference, of course,
p367
aVis we know that there are other planets out there,
p368
aVbut so far I've only speculated on the possibility
p369
aVthat there might be other universes.
p370
aVSo to pull it all together,
p371
aVwe need a mechanism
p372
aVthat can actually generate other universes.
p373
aVAnd that takes me to my final part, part three.
p374
aVBecause such a mechanism has been found
p375
aVby cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang.
p376
aVYou see, when we speak of the Big Bang,
p377
aVwe often have an image
p378
aVof a kind of cosmic explosion
p379
aVthat created our universe
p380
aVand set space rushing outward.
p381
aa(lp382
VBut there's a little secret.
p383
aVThe Big Bang leaves out something pretty important,
p384
aVthe Bang.
p385
aVIt tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang,
p386
aVbut gives us no insight
p387
aVinto what would have powered the Bang itself.
p388
aVAnd this gap was finally filled
p389
aVby an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.
p390
aVIt's called inflationary cosmology,
p391
aVwhich identified a particular kind of fuel
p392
aVthat would naturally generate
p393
aVan outward rush of space.
p394
aVThe fuel is based on something called a quantum field,
p395
aVbut the only detail that matters for us
p396
aVis that this fuel proves to be so efficient
p397
aVthat it's virtually impossible
p398
aVto use it all up,
p399
aVwhich means in the inflationary theory,
p400
aVthe Big Bang giving rise to our universe
p401
aVis likely not a one-time event.
p402
aVInstead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang,
p403
aVbut it would also generate countless other Big Bangs,
p404
aVeach giving rise to its own separate universe
p405
aVwith our universe becoming but one bubble
p406
aVin a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.
p407
aa(lp408
VAnd now, when we meld this with string theory,
p409
aVhere's the picture we're led to.
p410
aVEach of these universes has extra dimensions.
p411
aVThe extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes.
p412
aVThe different shapes yield different physical features.
p413
aVAnd we find ourselves in one universe instead of another
p414
aVsimply because it's only in our universe
p415
aVthat the physical features, like the amount of dark energy,
p416
aVare right for our form of life to take hold.
p417
aVAnd this is the compelling but highly controversial picture
p418
aVof the wider cosmos
p419
aVthat cutting-edge observation and theory
p420
aVhave now led us to seriously consider.
p421
aa(lp422
VOne big remaining question, of course, is,
p423
aVcould we ever confirm
p424
aVthe existence of other universes?
p425
aVWell let me describe
p426
aVone way that might one day happen.
p427
aVThe inflationary theory
p428
aValready has strong observational support.
p429
aVBecause the theory predicts
p430
aVthat the Big Bang would have been so intense
p431
aVthat as space rapidly expanded,
p432
aVtiny quantum jitters from the micro world
p433
aVwould have been stretched out to the macro world,
p434
aVyielding a distinctive fingerprint,
p435
aVa pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots,
p436
aVacross space,
p437
aVwhich powerful telescopes have now observed.
p438
aVGoing further, if there are other universes,
p439
aVthe theory predicts that every so often
p440
aVthose universes can collide.
p441
aVAnd if our universe got hit by another,
p442
aVthat collision
p443
aVwould generate an additional subtle pattern
p444
aVof temperature variations across space
p445
aVthat we might one day
p446
aVbe able to detect.
p447
aVAnd so exotic as this picture is,
p448
aVit may one day be grounded
p449
aVin observations,
p450
aVestablishing the existence of other universes.
p451
aa(lp452
VI'll conclude
p453
aVwith a striking implication
p454
aVof all these ideas
p455
aVfor the very far future.
p456
aVYou see, we learned
p457
aVthat our universe is not static,
p458
aVthat space is expanding,
p459
aVthat that expansion is speeding up
p460
aVand that there might be other universes
p461
aVall by carefully examining
p462
aVfaint pinpoints of starlight
p463
aVcoming to us from distant galaxies.
p464
aVBut because the expansion is speeding up,
p465
aVin the very far future,
p466
aVthose galaxies will rush away so far and so fast
p467
aVthat we won't be able to see them \u2014
p468
aVnot because of technological limitations,
p469
aVbut because of the laws of physics.
p470
aVThe light those galaxies emit,
p471
aVeven traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light,
p472
aVwill not be able to overcome
p473
aVthe ever-widening gulf between us.
p474
aVSo astronomers in the far future
p475
aVlooking out into deep space
p476
aVwill see nothing but an endless stretch
p477
aVof static, inky, black stillness.
p478
aVAnd they will conclude
p479
aVthat the universe is static and unchanging
p480
aVand populated by a single central oasis of matter
p481
aVthat they inhabit \u2014
p482
aVa picture of the cosmos
p483
aVthat we definitively know to be wrong.
p484
aa(lp485
VNow maybe those future astronomers will have records
p486
aVhanded down from an earlier era,
p487
aVlike ours,
p488
aVattesting to an expanding cosmos
p489
aVteeming with galaxies.
p490
aVBut would those future astronomers
p491
aVbelieve such ancient knowledge?
p492
aVOr would they believe
p493
aVin the black, static empty universe
p494
aVthat their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?
p495
aVI suspect the latter.
p496
aVWhich means that we are living
p497
aVthrough a remarkably privileged era

aVwhen certain deep truths about the cosmos
p499
aVare still within reach
p500
aVof the human spirit of exploration.
p501
aVIt appears that it may not always be that way.
p502
aVBecause today's astronomers,
p503
aVby turning powerful telescopes to the sky,
p504
aVhave captured a handful of starkly informative photons \u2014
p505
aVa kind of cosmic telegram
p506
aVbillions of years in transit.
p507
aVand the message echoing across the ages is clear.
p508
aVSometimes nature guards her secrets
p509
aVwith the unbreakable grip
p510
aVof physical law.
p511
aVSometimes the true nature of reality beckons
p512
aVfrom just beyond the horizon.
p513
aa(lp514
VThank you very much.
p515

p517
aa(lp518
VChris Anderson: Brian, thank you.
p519
aVThe range of ideas you've just spoken about
p520
aVare dizzying, exhilarating, incredible.
p521
aVHow do you think
p522
aVof where cosmology is now,
p523
aVin a sort of historical side?
p524
aVAre we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?
p525
aa(lp526
VBG: Well it's hard to say.
p527
aVWhen we learn that astronomers of the far future
p528
aVmay not have enough information to figure things out,
p529
aVthe natural question is, maybe we're already in that position
p530
aVand certain deep, critical features of the universe
p531
aValready have escaped our ability to understand
p532
aVbecause of how cosmology evolves.
p533
aVSo from that perspective,
p534
aVmaybe we will always be asking questions
p535
aVand never be able to fully answer them.
p536
aa(lp537
VOn the other hand, we now can understand
p538
aVhow old the universe is.
p539
aVWe can understand
p540
aVhow to understand the data from the microwave background radiation
p541
aVthat was set down 13.72 billion years ago \u2014
p542
aVand yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look
p543
aVand it matches.
p544
aVHoly cow! That's just amazing.
p545
aVSo on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten,
p546
aVbut who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future.
p547
aa(lp548
VCA: You're going to be around for the next few days.
p549
aVMaybe some of these conversations can continue.
p550
aVThank you. Thank you, Brian. (BG: My pleasure.)

VWell after many years working in trade and economics,
p5
aVfour years ago,
p6
aVI found myself working on the front lines
p7
aVof human vulnerability.
p8
aVAnd I found myself in the places
p9
aVwhere people are fighting every day to survive
p10
aVand can't even obtain a meal.
p11
aVThis red cup comes from Rwanda
p12
aVfrom a child named Fabian.
p13
aVAnd I carry this around
p14
aVas a symbol, really, of the challenge
p15
aVand also the hope.
p16
aVBecause one cup of food a day
p17
aVchanges Fabian's life completely.
p18
aVBut what I'd like to talk about today
p19
aVis the fact that this morning,
p20
aVabout a billion people on Earth \u2014
p21
aVor one out of every seven \u2014
p22
aVwoke up and didn't even know
p23
aVhow to fill this cup.
p24
aVOne out of every seven people.
p25
aa(lp26
VFirst, I'll ask you: Why should you care?
p27
aVWhy should we care?
p28
aVFor most people,
p29
aVif they think about hunger,
p30
aVthey don't have to go far back on their own family history \u2014
p31
aVmaybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives,
p32
aVor their grandparents' lives \u2014
p33
aVto remember an experience of hunger.
p34
aVI rarely find an audience
p35
aVwhere people can go back very far without that experience.
p36
aVSome are driven by compassion,
p37
aVfeel it's perhaps
p38
aVone of the fundamental acts of humanity.
p39
aVAs Gandhi said,
p40
aV"To a hungry man, a piece of bread is the face of God."
p41
aVOthers worry about peace and security,
p42
aVstability in the world.
p43
aVWe saw the food riots in 2008,
p44
aVafter what I call the silent tsunami of hunger
p45
aVswept the globe when food prices doubled overnight.
p46
aVThe destabilizing effects of hunger
p47
aVare known throughout human history.
p48
aVOne of the most fundamental acts of civilization
p49
aVis to ensure people can get enough food.
p50
aa(lp51
VOthers think about Malthusian nightmares.
p52
aVWill we be able to feed a population
p53
aVthat will be nine billion in just a few decades?
p54
aVThis is not a negotiable thing, hunger.
p55
aVPeople have to eat.
p56
aVThere's going to be a lot of people.
p57
aVThis is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain.
p58
aVBut I actually came to this issue
p59
aVin a different way.
p60
aVThis is a picture of me and my three children.
p61
aVIn 1987, I was a new mother
p62
aVwith my first child
p63
aVand was holding her and feeding her
p64
aVwhen an image very similar to this
p65
aVcame on the television.
p66
aVAnd this was yet another famine in Ethiopia.
p67
aVOne two years earlier
p68
aVhad killed more than a million people.
p69
aVBut it never struck me as it did that moment,
p70
aVbecause on that image
p71
aVwas a woman trying to nurse her baby,
p72
aVand she had no milk to nurse.
p73
aVAnd the baby's cry really penetrated me,
p74
aVas a mother.
p75
aVAnd I thought, there's nothing more haunting
p76
aVthan the cry of a child
p77
aVthat cannot be returned with food \u2014
p78
aVthe most fundamental expectation of every human being.
p79
aVAnd it was at that moment
p80
aVthat I just was filled
p81
aVwith the challenge and the outrage
p82
aVthat actually we know how to fix this problem.
p83
aa(lp84
VThis isn't one of those rare diseases
p85
aVthat we don't have the solution for.
p86
aVWe know how to fix hunger.
p87
aVA hundred years ago, we didn't.
p88
aVWe actually have the technology and systems.
p89
aVAnd I was just struck
p90
aVthat this is out of place.
p91
aVAt our time in history, these images are out of place.
p92
aVWell guess what?
p93
aVThis is last week in northern Kenya.
p94
aVYet again,
p95
aVthe face of starvation
p96
aVat large scale
p97
aVwith more than nine million people
p98
aVwondering if they can make it to the next day.
p99
aVIn fact,
p100
aVwhat we know now
p101
aVis that every 10 seconds
p102
aVwe lose a child to hunger.
p103
aVThis is more
p104
aVthan HIV/AIDS,
p105
aVmalaria and tuberculosis combined.
p106
aVAnd we know that the issue
p107
aVis not just production of food.
p108
aa(lp109
VOne of my mentors in life
p110
aVwas Norman Borlaug, my hero.
p111
aVBut today I'm going to talk about access to food,
p112
aVbecause actually this year and last year
p113
aVand during the 2008 food crisis,
p114
aVthere was enough food on Earth
p115
aVfor everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories.
p116
aVSo why is it
p117
aVthat we have a billion people
p118
aVwho can't find food?
p119
aVAnd I also want to talk about
p120
aVwhat I call our new burden of knowledge.
p121
aVIn 2008,
p122
aVLancet compiled all the research
p123
aVand put forward the compelling evidence
p124
aVthat if a child in its first thousand days \u2014
p125
aVfrom conception to two years old \u2014
p126
aVdoes not have adequate nutrition,
p127
aVthe damage is irreversible.
p128
aVTheir brains and bodies will be stunted.
p129
aVAnd here you see a brain scan of two children \u2014
p130
aVone who had adequate nutrition,
p131
aVanother, neglected
p132
aVand who was deeply malnourished.
p133
aVAnd we can see brain volumes
p134
aVup to 40 percent less
p135
aVin these children.
p136
aVAnd in this slide
p137
aVyou see the neurons and the synapses of the brain
p138
aVdon't form.
p139
aVAnd what we know now is this has huge impact on economies,
p140
aVwhich I'll talk about later.
p141
aVBut also the earning potential of these children
p142
aVis cut in half in their lifetime
p143
aVdue to the stunting
p144
aVthat happens in early years.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo this burden of knowledge drives me.
p147
aVBecause actually we know how to fix it
p148
aVvery simply.
p149
aVAnd yet, in many places,
p150
aVa third of the children,
p151
aVby the time they're three
p152
aValready are facing a life of hardship
p153
aVdue to this.
p154
aVI'd like to talk about
p155
aVsome of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger,
p156
aVsome of the things I've learned
p157
aVin bringing my economic and trade knowledge
p158
aVand my experience in the private sector.
p159
aVI'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is.
p160
aa(lp161
VWell first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth,
p162
aVbreastfeeding.
p163
aVYou may be surprised to know
p164
aVthat a child could be saved every 22 seconds
p165
aVif there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life.
p166
aVBut in Niger, for example,
p167
aVless than seven percent of the children
p168
aVare breastfed
p169
aVfor the first six months of life, exclusively.
p170
aVIn Mauritania, less than three percent.
p171
aVThis is something that can be transformed with knowledge.
p172
aVThis message, this word, can come out
p173
aVthat this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business;
p174
aVit's a brilliant way
p175
aVof saving your child's life.
p176
aVAnd so today we focus on not just passing out food,
p177
aVbut making sure the mothers have enough enrichment,
p178
aVand teaching them about breastfeeding.
p179
aa(lp180
VThe second thing I'd like to talk about:
p181
aVIf you were living in a remote village somewhere,
p182
aVyour child was limp,
p183
aVand you were in a drought, or you were in floods,
p184
aVor you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet,
p185
aVwhat would you do?
p186
aVDo you think you could go to the store
p187
aVand get a choice of power bars, like we can,
p188
aVand pick the right one to match?
p189
aVWell I find parents out on the front lines
p190
aVvery aware their children are going down for the count.
p191
aVAnd I go to those shops, if there are any,
p192
aVor out to the fields to see what they can get,
p193
aVand they cannot obtain the nutrition.
p194
aVEven if they know what they need to do, it's not available.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd I'm very excited about this,
p197
aVbecause one thing we're working on
p198
aVis transforming the technologies
p199
aVthat are very available
p200
aVin the food industry
p201
aVto be available for traditional crops.
p202
aVAnd this is made with chickpeas, dried milk
p203
aVand a host of vitamins,
p204
aVmatched to exactly what the brain needs.
p205
aVIt costs 17 cents for us to produce this
p206
aVas, what I call, food for humanity.
p207
aVWe did this with food technologists
p208
aVin India and Pakistan \u2014
p209
aVreally about three of them.
p210
aVBut this is transforming
p211
aV99 percent of the kids who get this.
p212
aVOne package, 17 cents a day \u2014
p213
aVtheir malnutrition is overcome.
p214
aVSo I am convinced
p215
aVthat if we can unlock the technologies
p216
aVthat are commonplace in the richer world
p217
aVto be able to transform foods.
p218
aVAnd this is climate-proof.
p219
aVIt doesn't need to be refrigerated, it doesn't need water,
p220
aVwhich is often lacking.
p221
aVAnd these types of technologies,
p222
aVI see, have the potential
p223
aVto transform the face of hunger and nutrition, malnutrition
p224
aVout on the front lines.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe next thing I want to talk about is school feeding.
p227
aVEighty percent of the people in the world
p228
aVhave no food safety net.
p229
aVWhen disaster strikes \u2014
p230
aVthe economy gets blown, people lose a job,
p231
aVfloods, war, conflict,
p232
aVbad governance, all of those things \u2014
p233
aVthere is nothing to fall back on.
p234
aVAnd usually the institutions \u2014
p235
aVchurches, temples, other things \u2014
p236
aVdo not have the resources
p237
aVto provide a safety net.
p238
aVWhat we have found working with the World Bank
p239
aVis that the poor man's safety net,
p240
aVthe best investment, is school feeding.
p241
aVAnd if you fill the cup
p242
aVwith local agriculture from small farmers,
p243
aVyou have a transformative effect.
p244
aVMany kids in the world can't go to school
p245
aVbecause they have to go beg and find a meal.
p246
aVBut when that food is there,
p247
aVit's transformative.
p248
aVIt costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life.
p249
aa(lp250
VBut what is most amazing is the effect on girls.
p251
aVIn countries where girls don't go to school
p252
aVand you offer a meal to girls in school,
p253
aVwe see enrollment rates
p254
aVabout 50 percent girls and boys.
p255
aVWe see a transformation in attendance by girls.
p256
aVAnd there was no argument,
p257
aVbecause it's incentive.
p258
aVFamilies need the help.
p259
aVAnd we find that if we keep girls in school later,
p260
aVthey'll stay in school until they're 16,
p261
aVand won't get married if there's food in school.
p262
aVOr if they get an extra ration of food
p263
aVat the end of the week \u2014
p264
aVit costs about 50 cents \u2014
p265
aVwill keep a girl in school,
p266
aVand they'll give birth to a healthier child,
p267
aVbecause the malnutrition is sent
p268
aVgeneration to generation.
p269
aa(lp270
VWe know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger.
p271
aVWe know this.
p272
aVRight now on the Horn of Africa, we've been through this before.
p273
aVSo is this a hopeless cause?
p274
aVAbsolutely not.
p275
aVI'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope.
p276
aVCameroon, northern Cameroon, boom and bust cycles of hunger
p277
aVevery year for decades.
p278
aVFood aid coming in every year
p279
aVwhen people are starving during the lean seasons.
p280
aVWell two years ago,
p281
aVwe decided, let's transform the model of fighting hunger,
p282
aVand instead of giving out the food aid, we put it into food banks.
p283
aVAnd we said, listen,
p284
aVduring the lean season, take the food out.
p285
aVYou manage, the village manages these warehouses.
p286
aVAnd during harvest, put it back with interest,
p287
aVfood interest.
p288
aVSo add in five percent, 10 percent more food.
p289
aVFor the past two years,
p290
aV500 of these villages where these are
p291
aVhave not needed any food aid \u2014 they're self-sufficient.
p292
aVAnd the food banks are growing.
p293
aVAnd they're starting school feeding programs for their children
p294
aVby the people in the village.
p295
aVBut they've never had the ability
p296
aVto build even the basic infrastructure
p297
aVor the resources.
p298
aVI love this idea that came from the village level:
p299
aVthree keys to unlock that warehouse.
p300
aVFood is gold there.
p301
aVAnd simple ideas can transform the face,
p302
aVnot of small areas,
p303
aVof big areas of the world.
p304
aa(lp305
VI'd like to talk about what I call digital food.
p306
aVTechnology is transforming
p307
aVthe face of food vulnerability
p308
aVin places where you see classic famine.
p309
aVAmartya Sen won his Nobel Prize
p310
aVfor saying, "Guess what, famines happen in the presence of food
p311
aVbecause people have no ability to buy it."
p312
aVWe certainly saw that in 2008.
p313
aVWe're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa
p314
aVwhere food prices are up 240 percent in some areas
p315
aVover last year.
p316
aVFood can be there and people can't buy it.
p317
aa(lp318
VWell this picture \u2014 I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop,
p319
aVwhere instead of bringing in food,
p320
aVwe provide digital food, a card.
p321
aVIt says "bon appetit" in Arabic.
p322
aVAnd the women can go in and swipe
p323
aVand get nine food items.
p324
aVThey have to be nutritious,
p325
aVand they have to be locally produced.
p326
aVAnd what's happened in the past year alone
p327
aVis the dairy industry \u2014
p328
aVwhere this card's used for milk and yogurt
p329
aVand eggs and hummus \u2014
p330
aVthe dairy industry has gone up 30 percent.
p331
aVThe shopkeepers are hiring more people.
p332
aVIt is a win-win-win situation
p333
aVthat starts the food economy moving.
p334
aVWe now deliver food in over 30 countries
p335
aVover cell phones,
p336
aVtransforming even the presence of refugees in countries,
p337
aVand other ways.
p338
aa(lp339
VPerhaps most exciting to me
p340
aVis an idea that Bill Gates, Howard Buffett and others
p341
aVhave supported boldly,
p342
aVwhich is to ask the question:
p343
aVWhat if, instead of looking at the hungry as victims \u2014
p344
aVand most of them are small farmers
p345
aVwho cannot raise enough food or sell food
p346
aVto even support their own families \u2014
p347
aVwhat if we view them as the solution,
p348
aVas the value chain to fight hunger?
p349
aVWhat if from the women in Africa
p350
aVwho cannot sell any food \u2014
p351
aVthere's no roads, there's no warehouses,
p352
aVthere's not even a tarp to pick the food up with \u2014
p353
aVwhat if we give the enabling environment
p354
aVfor them to provide the food
p355
aVto feed the hungry children elsewhere?
p356
aVAnd Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries.
p357
aVAnd guess what?
p358
aVIn virtually every case,
p359
aVwhen poor farmers are given a guaranteed market \u2014
p360
aVif you say, "We will buy 300 metric tons of this.
p361
aVWe'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly." \u2014
p362
aVtheir yields have gone up two-, three-, fourfold
p363
aVand they figure it out,
p364
aVbecause it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life.
p365
aVAnd we're seeing people transform their lives.
p366
aVToday, food aid, our food aid \u2014
p367
aVhuge engine \u2014
p368
aV80 percent of it is bought in the developing world.
p369
aVTotal transformation
p370
aVthat can actually transform the very lives that need the food.
p371
aa(lp372
VNow you'd ask, can this be done at scale?
p373
aVThese are great ideas, village-level ideas.
p374
aVWell I'd like to talk about Brazil,
p375
aVbecause I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years,
p376
aVwhen I read that Brazil was defeating hunger
p377
aVfaster than any nation on Earth right now.
p378
aVAnd what I've found is,
p379
aVrather than investing their money in food subsidies
p380
aVand other things,
p381
aVthey invested in a school feeding program.
p382
aVAnd they require that a third of that food
p383
aVcome from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity.
p384
aVAnd they're doing this at huge scale
p385
aVafter President Lula declared his goal
p386
aVof ensuring everyone had three meals a day.
p387
aVAnd this zero hunger program
p388
aVcosts .5 percent of GDP
p389
aVand has lifted many millions of people
p390
aVout of hunger and poverty.
p391
aVIt is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil,
p392
aVand it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities.
p393
aVI've gone out there; I've met with the small farmers
p394
aVwho have built their livelihoods
p395
aVon the opportunity and platform
p396
aVprovided by this.
p397
aa(lp398
VNow if we look at the economic imperative here,
p399
aVthis isn't just about compassion.
p400
aVThe fact is studies show
p401
aVthat the cost of malnutrition and hunger \u2014
p402
aVthe cost to society,
p403
aVthe burden it has to bear \u2014
p404
aVis on average six percent,
p405
aVand in some countries up to 11 percent,
p406
aVof GDP a year.
p407
aVAnd if you look at the 36 countries
p408
aVwith the highest burden of malnutrition,
p409
aVthat's 260 billion lost from a productive economy
p410
aVevery year.
p411
aVWell, the World Bank estimates
p412
aVit would take about 10 billion dollars \u2014
p413
aV10.3 \u2014
p414
aVto address malnutrition in those countries.
p415
aVYou look at the cost-benefit analysis,
p416
aVand my dream is to take this issue,
p417
aVnot just from the compassion argument,
p418
aVbut to the finance ministers of the world,
p419
aVand say we cannot afford
p420
aVto not invest
p421
aVin the access to adequate, affordable nutrition
p422
aVfor all of humanity.
p423
aa(lp424
VThe amazing thing I've found
p425
aVis nothing can change on a big scale
p426
aVwithout the determination of a leader.
p427
aVWhen a leader says, "Not under my watch,"
p428
aVeverything begins to change.
p429
aVAnd the world can come in
p430
aVwith enabling environments and opportunities to do this.
p431
aVAnd the fact that France
p432
aVhas put food at the center of the G20
p433
aVis really important.
p434
aVBecause food is one issue
p435
aVthat cannot be solved person by person, nation by nation.
p436
aVWe have to stand together.
p437
aVAnd we're seeing nations in Africa.
p438
aVWFP's been able to leave 30 nations
p439
aVbecause they have transformed
p440
aVthe face of hunger in their nations.
p441
aa(lp442
VWhat I would like to offer here is a challenge.
p443
aVI believe we're living at a time in human history
p444
aVwhere it's just simply unacceptable
p445
aVthat children wake up
p446
aVand don't know where to find a cup of food.
p447
aVNot only that,
p448
aVtransforming hunger
p449
aVis an opportunity,
p450
aVbut I think we have to change our mindsets.
p451
aVI am so honored to be here
p452
aVwith some of the world's top innovators and thinkers.
p453
aVAnd I would like you to join with all of humanity
p454
aVto draw a line in the sand
p455
aVand say, "No more.
p456
aVNo more are we going to accept this."
p457
aVAnd we want to tell our grandchildren
p458
aVthat there was a terrible time in history
p459
aVwhere up to a third of the children
p460
aVhad brains and bodies that were stunted,
p461
aVbut that exists no more.
p462
aa(lp463
VThank you.

VWe live in in a remarkable time,
p5
aVthe age of genomics.
p6
aVYour genome is the entire sequence of your DNA.
p7
aVYour sequence and mine are slightly different.
p8
aVThat's why we look different.
p9
aVI've got brown eyes;
p10
aVyou might have blue or gray.
p11
aVBut it's not just skin-deep.
p12
aVThe headlines tell us
p13
aVthat genes can give us scary diseases,
p14
aVmaybe even shape our personality,
p15
aVor give us mental disorders.
p16
aVOur genes seem to have
p17
aVawesome power over our destinies.
p18
aVAnd yet, I would like to think
p19
aVthat I am more than my genes.
p20
aVWhat do you guys think?
p21
aVAre you more than your genes?
p22
aV(Audience: Yes.) Yes?
p23
aVI think some people agree with me.
p24
aVI think we should make a statement.
p25
aVI think we should say it all together.
p26
aVAll right: "I'm more than my genes" \u2014 all together.
p27
aVEverybody: I am more than my genes.
p28
aV(Cheering)
p29
aVSebastian Seung: What am I?
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVI am my connectome.
p32
aVNow, since you guys are really great,
p33
aVmaybe you can humor me and say this all together too.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVRight. All together now.
p36
aVEverybody: I am my connectome.
p37
aVSS: That sounded great.
p38
aVYou know, you guys are so great, you don't even know what a connectome is,
p39
aVand you're willing to play along with me.
p40
aVI could just go home now.
p41
aa(lp42
VWell, so far only one connectome is known,
p43
aVthat of this tiny worm.
p44
aVIts modest nervous system
p45
aVconsists of just 300 neurons.
p46
aVAnd in the 1970s and '80s,
p47
aVa team of scientists
p48
aVmapped all 7,000 connections
p49
aVbetween the neurons.
p50
aVIn this diagram, every node is a neuron,
p51
aVand every line is a connection.
p52
aVThis is the connectome
p53
aVof the worm C. elegans.
p54
aVYour connectome is far more complex than this
p55
aVbecause your brain
p56
aVcontains 100 billion neurons
p57
aVand 10,000 times as many connections.
p58
aVThere's a diagram like this for your brain,
p59
aVbut there's no way it would fit on this slide.
p60
aVYour connectome contains one million times more connections
p61
aVthan your genome has letters.
p62
aVThat's a lot of information.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhat's in that information?
p65
aVWe don't know for sure, but there are theories.
p66
aVSince the 19th century, neuroscientists have speculated
p67
aVthat maybe your memories \u2014
p68
aVthe information that makes you, you \u2014
p69
aVmaybe your memories are stored
p70
aVin the connections between your brain's neurons.
p71
aVAnd perhaps other aspects of your personal identity \u2014
p72
aVmaybe your personality and your intellect \u2014
p73
aVmaybe they're also encoded
p74
aVin the connections between your neurons.
p75
aVAnd so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis:
p76
aVI am my connectome.
p77
aVI didn't ask you to chant it because it's true;
p78
aVI just want you to remember it.
p79
aVAnd in fact, we don't know if this hypothesis is correct,
p80
aVbecause we have never had technologies
p81
aVpowerful enough to test it.
p82
aVFinding that worm connectome
p83
aVtook over a dozen years of tedious labor.
p84
aVAnd to find the connectomes of brains more like our own,
p85
aVwe need more sophisticated technologies, that are automated,
p86
aVthat will speed up the process of finding connectomes.
p87
aVAnd in the next few minutes, I'll tell you about some of these technologies,
p88
aVwhich are currently under development
p89
aVin my lab and the labs of my collaborators.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow you've probably seen pictures of neurons before.
p92
aVYou can recognize them instantly
p93
aVby their fantastic shapes.
p94
aVThey extend long and delicate branches,
p95
aVand in short, they look like trees.
p96
aVBut this is just a single neuron.
p97
aVIn order to find connectomes,
p98
aVwe have to see all the neurons at the same time.
p99
aVSo let's meet Bobby Kasthuri,
p100
aVwho works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman
p101
aVat Harvard University.
p102
aVBobby is holding fantastically thin slices
p103
aVof a mouse brain.
p104
aVAnd we're zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times
p105
aVto obtain the resolution,
p106
aVso that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time.
p107
aVExcept, you still may not really recognize them,
p108
aVand that's because we have to work in three dimensions.
p109
aa(lp110
VIf we take many images of many slices of the brain
p111
aVand stack them up,
p112
aVwe get a three-dimensional image.
p113
aVAnd still, you may not see the branches.
p114
aVSo we start at the top,
p115
aVand we color in the cross-section of one branch in red,
p116
aVand we do that for the next slice
p117
aVand for the next slice.
p118
aVAnd we keep on doing that,
p119
aVslice after slice.
p120
aVIf we continue through the entire stack,
p121
aVwe can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape
p122
aVof a small fragment of a branch of a neuron.
p123
aVAnd we can do that for another neuron in green.
p124
aVAnd you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron
p125
aVat two locations,
p126
aVand these are what are called synapses.
p127
aa(lp128
VLet's zoom in on one synapse,
p129
aVand keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron.
p130
aVYou should see small circles \u2014
p131
aVthese are called vesicles.
p132
aVThey contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.
p133
aVAnd so when the green neuron wants to communicate,
p134
aVit wants to send a message to the red neuron,
p135
aVit spits out neurotransmitter.
p136
aVAt the synapse, the two neurons
p137
aVare said to be connected
p138
aVlike two friends talking on the telephone.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo you see how to find a synapse.
p141
aVHow can we find an entire connectome?
p142
aVWell, we take this three-dimensional stack of images
p143
aVand treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book.
p144
aVWe color every neuron in, in a different color,
p145
aVand then we look through all of the images,
p146
aVfind the synapses
p147
aVand note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse.
p148
aVIf we can do that throughout all the images,
p149
aVwe could find a connectome.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, at this point,
p152
aVyou've learned the basics of neurons and synapses.
p153
aVAnd so I think we're ready to tackle
p154
aVone of the most important questions in neuroscience:
p155
aVhow are the brains of men and women different?
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVAccording to this self-help book,
p158
aVguys brains are like waffles;
p159
aVthey keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes.
p160
aVGirls' brains are like spaghetti;
p161
aVeverything in their life is connected to everything else.
p162
aV(Laughter)
p163
aVYou guys are laughing,
p164
aVbut you know, this book changed my life.
p165
aV(Laughter)
p166
aVBut seriously, what's wrong with this?
p167
aVYou already know enough to tell me \u2014 what's wrong with this statement?
p168
aVIt doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl,
p169
aVeveryone's brains are like spaghetti.
p170
aVOr maybe really, really fine capellini with branches.
p171
aVJust as one strand of spaghetti
p172
aVcontacts many other strands on your plate,
p173
aVone neuron touches many other neurons
p174
aVthrough their entangled branches.
p175
aVOne neuron can be connected to so many other neurons,
p176
aVbecause there can be synapses
p177
aVat these points of contact.
p178
aVBy now, you might have sort of lost perspective
p179
aVon how large this cube of brain tissue actually is.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd so let's do a series of comparisons to show you.
p182
aVI assure you, this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side.
p183
aVSo, here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron.
p184
aVAnd you can tell that, really, only the smallest fragments of branches
p185
aVare contained inside this cube.
p186
aVAnd a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.
p187
aVAnd that's just a mouse brain \u2014
p188
aVit's a lot smaller than a human brain.
p189
aVSo when show my friends this,
p190
aVsometimes they've told me,
p191
aV"You know, Sebastian, you should just give up.
p192
aVNeuroscience is hopeless."
p193
aVBecause if you look at a brain with your naked eye,
p194
aVyou don't really see how complex it is,
p195
aVbut when you use a microscope,
p196
aVfinally the hidden complexity is revealed.
p197
aa(lp198
VIn the 17th century,
p199
aVthe mathematician and philosopher, Blaise Pascal,
p200
aVwrote of his dread of the infinite,
p201
aVhis feeling of insignificance
p202
aVat contemplating the vast reaches of outer space.
p203
aVAnd, as a scientist,
p204
aVI'm not supposed to talk about my feelings \u2014
p205
aVtoo much information, professor.
p206
aV(Laughter)
p207
aVBut may I?
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aV(Applause)
p210
aVI feel curiosity,
p211
aVand I feel wonder,
p212
aVbut at times I have also felt despair.
p213
aVWhy did I choose to study
p214
aVthis organ that is so awesome in its complexity
p215
aVthat it might well be infinite?
p216
aVIt's absurd.
p217
aVHow could we even dare to think
p218
aVthat we might ever understand this?
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd yet, I persist in this quixotic endeavor.
p221
aVAnd indeed, these days I harbor new hopes.
p222
aVSomeday,
p223
aVa fleet of microscopes will capture
p224
aVevery neuron and every synapse
p225
aVin a vast database of images.
p226
aVAnd some day, artificially intelligent supercomputers
p227
aVwill analyze the images without human assistance
p228
aVto summarize them in a connectome.
p229
aVI do not know, but I hope that I will live to see that day,
p230
aVbecause finding an entire human connectome
p231
aVis one of the greatest technological challenges of all time.
p232
aVIt will take the work of generations to succeed.
p233
aVAt the present time, my collaborators and I,
p234
aVwhat we're aiming for is much more modest \u2014
p235
aVjust to find partial connectomes
p236
aVof tiny chunks of mouse and human brain.
p237
aVBut even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis
p238
aVthat I am my connectome.
p239
aVFor now, let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis,
p240
aVthat it's actually worth taking seriously.
p241
aa(lp242
VAs you grow during childhood
p243
aVand age during adulthood,
p244
aVyour personal identity changes slowly.
p245
aVLikewise, every connectome
p246
aVchanges over time.
p247
aVWhat kinds of changes happen?
p248
aVWell, neurons, like trees,
p249
aVcan grow new branches,
p250
aVand they can lose old ones.
p251
aVSynapses can be created,
p252
aVand they can be eliminated.
p253
aVAnd synapses can grow larger,
p254
aVand they can grow smaller.
p255
aVSecond question:
p256
aVwhat causes these changes?
p257
aVWell, it's true.
p258
aVTo some extent, they are programmed by your genes.
p259
aVBut that's not the whole story,
p260
aVbecause there are signals, electrical signals,
p261
aVthat travel along the branches of neurons
p262
aVand chemical signals
p263
aVthat jump across from branch to branch.
p264
aVThese signals are called neural activity.
p265
aVAnd there's a lot of evidence
p266
aVthat neural activity
p267
aVis encoding our thoughts, feelings and perceptions,
p268
aVour mental experiences.
p269
aVAnd there's a lot of evidence that neural activity
p270
aVcan cause your connections to change.
p271
aVAnd if you put those two facts together,
p272
aVit means that your experiences
p273
aVcan change your connectome.
p274
aVAnd that's why every connectome is unique,
p275
aVeven those of genetically identical twins.
p276
aVThe connectome is where nature meets nurture.
p277
aVAnd it might true
p278
aVthat just the mere act of thinking
p279
aVcan change your connectome \u2014
p280
aVan idea that you may find empowering.
p281
aa(lp282
VWhat's in this picture?
p283
aVA cool and refreshing stream of water, you say.
p284
aVWhat else is in this picture?
p285
aVDo not forget that groove in the Earth
p286
aVcalled the stream bed.
p287
aVWithout it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.
p288
aVAnd with the stream,
p289
aVI would like to propose a metaphor
p290
aVfor the relationship between neural activity
p291
aVand connectivity.
p292
aVNeural activity is constantly changing.
p293
aVIt's like the water of the stream; it never sits still.
p294
aVThe connections
p295
aVof the brain's neural network
p296
aVdetermines the pathways
p297
aValong which neural activity flows.
p298
aVAnd so the connectome is like bed of the stream;
p299
aVbut the metaphor is richer than that,
p300
aVbecause it's true that the stream bed
p301
aVguides the flow of the water,
p302
aVbut over long timescales,
p303
aVthe water also reshapes the bed of the stream.
p304
aVAnd as I told you just now,
p305
aVneural activity can change the connectome.
p306
aVAnd if you'll allow me to ascend
p307
aVto metaphorical heights,
p308
aVI will remind you that neural activity
p309
aVis the physical basis \u2014 or so neuroscientists think \u2014
p310
aVof thoughts, feelings and perceptions.
p311
aVAnd so we might even speak of
p312
aVthe stream of consciousness.
p313
aVNeural activity is its water,
p314
aVand the connectome is its bed.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo let's return from the heights of metaphor
p317
aVand return to science.
p318
aVSuppose our technologies for finding connectomes
p319
aVactually work.
p320
aVHow will we go about testing the hypothesis
p321
aV"I am my connectome?"
p322
aVWell, I propose a direct test.
p323
aVLet us attempt
p324
aVto read out memories from connectomes.
p325
aVConsider the memory
p326
aVof long temporal sequences of movements,
p327
aVlike a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata.
p328
aVAccording to a theory that dates back to the 19th century,
p329
aVsuch memories are stored
p330
aVas chains of synaptic connections inside your brain.
p331
aVBecause, if the first neurons in the chain are activated,
p332
aVthrough their synapses they send messages to the second neurons, which are activated,
p333
aVand so on down the line,
p334
aVlike a chain of falling dominoes.
p335
aVAnd this sequence of neural activation
p336
aVis hypothesized to be the neural basis
p337
aVof those sequence of movements.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo one way of trying to test the theory
p340
aVis to look for such chains
p341
aVinside connectomes.
p342
aVBut it won't be easy, because they're not going to look like this.
p343
aVThey're going to be scrambled up.
p344
aVSo we'll have to use our computers
p345
aVto try to unscramble the chain.
p346
aVAnd if we can do that,
p347
aVthe sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling
p348
aVwill be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity
p349
aVthat is replayed in the brain during memory recall.
p350
aVAnd if that were successful,
p351
aVthat would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VWhat a mess \u2014
p356
aVhave you ever tried to wire up a system
p357
aVas complex as this?
p358
aVI hope not.
p359
aVBut if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake.
p360
aVThe branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain.
p361
aVCan anyone guess: what's the total length of wires in your brain?
p362
aVI'll give you a hint. It's a big number.
p363
aV(Laughter)
p364
aVI estimate, millions of miles,
p365
aVall packed in your skull.
p366
aVAnd if you appreciate that number,
p367
aVyou can easily see
p368
aVthere is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain.
p369
aVAnd indeed, the popular press loves headlines like,
p370
aV"Anorexic brains are wired differently,"
p371
aVor "Autistic brains are wired differently."
p372
aVThese are plausible claims,
p373
aVbut in truth,
p374
aVwe can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough
p375
aVto tell if these are really true.
p376
aVAnd so the technologies for seeing connectomes
p377
aVwill allow us to finally
p378
aVread mis-wiring of the brain,
p379
aVto see mental disorders in connectomes.
p380
aa(lp381
VSometimes the best way to test a hypothesis
p382
aVis to consider its most extreme implication.
p383
aVPhilosophers know this game very well.
p384
aVIf you believe that I am my connectome,
p385
aVI think you must also accept the idea
p386
aVthat death is the destruction
p387
aVof your connectome.
p388
aVI mention this because there are prophets today
p389
aVwho claim that technology
p390
aVwill fundamentally alter the human condition
p391
aVand perhaps even transform the human species.
p392
aVOne of their most cherished dreams
p393
aVis to cheat death
p394
aVby that practice known as cryonics.
p395
aVIf you pay 100,000 dollars,
p396
aVyou can arrange to have your body frozen after death
p397
aVand stored in liquid nitrogen
p398
aVin one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse,
p399
aVawaiting a future civilization
p400
aVthat is advanced to resurrect you.
p401
aa(lp402
VShould we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality,
p403
aVcalling them fools?
p404
aVOr will they someday chuckle
p405
aVover our graves?
p406
aVI don't know \u2014
p407
aVI prefer to test their beliefs, scientifically.
p408
aVI propose that we attempt to find a connectome
p409
aVof a frozen brain.
p410
aVWe know that damage to the brain
p411
aVoccurs after death and during freezing.
p412
aVThe question is: has that damage erased the connectome?
p413
aVIf it has, there is no way that any future civilization
p414
aVwill be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains.
p415
aVResurrection might succeed for the body,
p416
aVbut not for the mind.
p417
aVOn the other hand, if the connectome is still intact,
p418
aVwe cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily.
p419
aa(lp420
VI've described a quest
p421
aVthat begins in the world of the very small,
p422
aVand propels us to the world of the far future.
p423
aVConnectomes will mark a turning point in human history.
p424
aVAs we evolved from our ape-like ancestors
p425
aVon the African savanna,
p426
aVwhat distinguished us was our larger brains.
p427
aVWe have used our brains to fashion
p428
aVever more amazing technologies.
p429
aVEventually, these technologies will become so powerful
p430
aVthat we will use them to know ourselves
p431
aVby deconstructing and reconstructing
p432
aVour own brains.
p433
aVI believe that this voyage of self-discovery
p434
aVis not just for scientists,
p435
aVbut for all of us.
p436
aVAnd I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today.

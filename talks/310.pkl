VBrain magic. What's brain magic all about?
p5
aVBrain magic to me indicates that area of magic
p6
aVdealing with psychological and mind-reading effects.
p7
aVSo unlike traditional magic, it uses the power of words,
p8
aVlinguistic deception, non-verbal communication
p9
aVand various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense.
p10
aa(lp11
VI'm going to show you all how easy it is
p12
aVto manipulate the human mind once you know how.
p13
aVI want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody.
p14
aVI want everybody to put out your hands like this for me, first of all.
p15
aVOK, clap them together, once.
p16
aVOK, reverse your hands.
p17
aVNow, follow my actions exactly.
p18
aVNow about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that?
p19
aVOK, swap them around, put your right hand up.
p20
aVCross your hands over, so your right hand goes over,
p21
aVinterlace your fingers like this,
p22
aVthen make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb \u2014
p23
aVthat's very important.
p24
aVYours is the other way around, so swap it around.
p25
aVExcellent, OK. Extend your fingers like this for me.
p26
aVAll right. Tap them together once.
p27
aVOK, now, if you did not allow me to deceive your minds,
p28
aVyou would all be able to do this.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter ends)
p33
aa(lp34
VNow you can see how easy it is
p35
aVfor me to manipulate the human mind, once you know how.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, I remember when I was about 15,
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VI read a copy of Life magazine,
p44
aVwhich detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman
p45
aVwho could sense printed letters \u2014
p46
aVthere's still people trying to do it \u2014
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
V\u2014 who could sense printed letters and even sense colors, just by touch.
p51
aVAnd she was completely blind.
p52
aVShe could also read the serial numbers on bills
p53
aVwhen they were placed, face down, on a hard surface.
p54
aVNow, I was fascinated, but at the same time, skeptical.
p55
aVHow could somebody read using their fingertips?
p56
aVYou know, if you actually think about it, if somebody is totally blind \u2014
p57
aVa guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms,
p58
aVwhere people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things.
p59
aVAnd it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out.
p60
aVHow could somebody read using their fingertips?
p61
aa(lp62
VNow earlier on, as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV,
p63
aVI attempted to give a similar demonstration
p64
aVof what is now known as second sight.
p65
aVSo, let's take a look.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Video) Man: There we go.
p68
aVI'm going to guide you into the car.
p69
aa(lp70
VKathryn Thomas: (Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VMan: You're OK, keep on going.
p73
aa(lp74
VKT: How are you?
p75
aa(lp76
VKeith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here.
p77
aVI'm going to take you to a secret location, OK?
p78
aVKathryn, there was no way you could see through that blindfold.
p79
aa(lp80
VKT: OK, but don't say my name like that. KB: But you're OK?
p81
aa(lp82
VKT: Yes.
p83
aa(lp84
VKB: No way to see through it? KT: No.
p85
aa(lp86
VKB: I'll take it off.
p87
aVDo you want to take the rest off?
p88
aVTake it off, you're OK. We'll stop for a second.
p89
aa(lp90
VKT: I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see.
p91
aa(lp92
VKB: You're fine, take it off. You're OK. You're safe.
p93
aVHave you ever heard of second sight?
p94
aa(lp95
VKT: No.
p96
aa(lp97
VKB: Second sight is whereby a mind-control expert
p98
aVcan see through somebody else's eyes.
p99
aVAnd I'm going to try that right now.
p100
aa(lp101
VKT: God.
p102
aa(lp103
VKB: Are you ready?
p104
aVWhere is it? There's no way \u2014
p105
aa(lp106
VKT: (Beep)
p107
aa(lp108
VKT: Oh, my God!
p109
aa(lp110
VKB: Don't say anything,
p111
aVI'm trying to see through your eyes. I can't see.
p112
aa(lp113
VKT: There's a wall, there's a wall.
p114
aa(lp115
VKB: Look at the road, look at the road.
p116
aa(lp117
VKT: OK, OK, OK. Oh, my God!
p118
aa(lp119
VKB: Now, anything coming at all? KT: No.
p120
aa(lp121
VKB: Sure there's not?
p122
aa(lp123
VKT: No, no, I'm just still looking at the road.
p124
aVI'm looking at the road, all the time.
p125
aVI'm not taking my eyes off the road.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Beep)
p128
aa(lp129
V(Beep)
p130
aa(lp131
V(Beep)
p132
aa(lp133
VKT: Oh, my God!
p134
aa(lp135
VKB: Where are we? Where are we?
p136
aVWe're going uphill, are we going uphill?
p137
aa(lp138
VKT: Look at the road \u2014 (Beep)
p139
aVStill got that goddamn blindfold on.
p140
aa(lp141
VKB: What?
p142
aa(lp143
VKT: How are you doing this?
p144
aa(lp145
VKB: Just don't break my concentration.
p146
aa(lp147
VWe're OK, though? KT: Yes.
p148
aVThat's so weird.
p149
aVWe're nearly there. Oh, my God!
p150
aa(lp151
VOh, my God!
p152
aa(lp153
VKB: And I've stopped.
p154
aa(lp155
VKT: That is weird.
p156
aVYou're like a freak-ass of nature.
p157
aVThat was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life!
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VKB: Thank you.
p162
aVBy the way, two days ago, we were going to film this
p163
aVdown there, at the race course, and we got a guy into a car,
p164
aVand we got a camera man in the back,
p165
aVbut halfway through the drive,
p166
aVhe told me he had, I think it was a nine-millimeter,
p167
aVstuck to his leg.
p168
aVSo, I stopped pretty quick, and that was it.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo, do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes?
p171
aVThat's the question.
p172
aVNow, most people here would automatically say no.
p173
aVOK, but I want you to realize some facts.
p174
aVI couldn't see through the blindfold.
p175
aVThe car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way.
p176
aVThe girl, I'd never met before, all right.
p177
aVSo, I want you to just think about it for a moment.
p178
aVA lot of people try to come up
p179
aVwith a logical solution to what just happened, all right.
p180
aVBut because your brains are not trained in the art of deception,
p181
aVthe solutions you come up with
p182
aVwill, 99 percent of the time, be way off the mark.
p183
aa(lp184
VThis is because magic is all about directing attention.
p185
aVIf, for instance, I didn't want you to look at my right hand,
p186
aVthen I don't look at it.
p187
aVBut if I wanted you to look at my right hand,
p188
aVthen I look at it, too.
p189
aVYou see, it's very simple, once you know how,
p190
aVbut very complicated in other ways.
p191
aa(lp192
VI'm going to give you some demonstrations right now.
p193
aVI need two people to help me out real quick. Can you come up?
p194
aVAnd let's see, down at the end, here, can you also come up, real quick?
p195
aVDo you mind? Yes, at the end.
p196
aVOK, give them a round of applause as they come up.
p197
aVYou might want to use the stairs, there.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Applause)
p200
aa(lp201
VIt's very important for everybody here to realize
p202
aVI haven't set anything up with you.
p203
aVYou don't know what will happen, right?
p204
aVWould you mind just standing over here for a moment?
p205
aa(lp206
VYour name is? Nicole: Nicole.
p207
aa(lp208
VKB: Nicole, and?
p209
aa(lp210
V(Telephone ringing)
p211
aa(lp212
VKB: Actually, here's the thing, answer it, answer it, answer it.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VIs it a girl? Man: They've already gone.
p217
aa(lp218
VKB: OK, swap over positions.
p219
aVCan you stand over here? This will make it easier.
p220
aVPity, I would have told them it was the ace of spades.
p221
aVOK, a little bit closer.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VOK, a little bit closer, come over \u2014 they look really nervous up here.
p226
aVDo you believe in witchcraft?
p227
aa(lp228
VNicole: No.
p229
aa(lp230
VKB: Voodoo? Nicole: No.
p231
aa(lp232
VKB: Things that go bump in the night? Nicole: No.
p233
aa(lp234
VKB: Besides, who's next, no, OK.
p235
aVI want you to just stand exactly like this for me,
p236
aVpull up your sleeves, if you don't mind.
p237
aVOK, now, I want you to be aware
p238
aVof all the different sensations around you,
p239
aVbecause we'll try a voodoo experiment.
p240
aVI want you to be aware of the sensations, but don't say anything until I ask you,
p241
aVand don't open your eyes until I ask you.
p242
aVFrom this point onwards, close your eyes,
p243
aVdo not say anything, do not open them,
p244
aVbe aware of the sensations.
p245
aa(lp246
VYes or no, did you feel anything?
p247
aa(lp248
VNicole: Yes.
p249
aa(lp250
VKB: You did feel that? What did you feel?
p251
aa(lp252
VNicole: A touch on my back.
p253
aa(lp254
VKB: How many times did you feel it?
p255
aa(lp256
VNicole: Twice.
p257
aa(lp258
VKB: Twice. OK, extend your left arm out in front of you.
p259
aVExtend your left arm, OK.
p260
aVOK, keep it there.
p261
aVBe aware of the sensations, don't say anything, don't open your eyes, OK.
p262
aa(lp263
VDid you feel anything, there?
p264
aa(lp265
VNicole: Yes. KB: What did you feel?
p266
aa(lp267
VNicole: Three \u2014
p268
aa(lp269
VKB: Like a tickling sensation? Nicole: Yes.
p270
aa(lp271
VKB: Can you show us where?
p272
aVOK, excellent. Open your eyes.
p273
aVI never touched you.
p274
aVI just touched his back, and I just touched his arm.
p275
aVA voodoo experiment.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VYeah, I walk around nightclubs all night like this.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VYou just take a seat over here for a second.
p284
aVI'm going to use you again, in a moment.
p285
aVCan you take a seat right over here, if you don't mind.
p286
aa(lp287
VSit right here. Man: OK.
p288
aa(lp289
VKB: OK, take a seat. Excellent, OK.
p290
aVNow, what I want you to do is look directly at me, OK,
p291
aVjust take a deep breath in through your nose,
p292
aVletting it out through your mouth, and relax.
p293
aVAllow your eyes to close, on five, four, three, two, one.
p294
aVClose your eyes right now.
p295
aVOK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you,
p296
aVI'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity,
p297
aVso our minds are along the same lines.
p298
aVAnd as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind,
p299
aVI'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here.
p300
aa(lp301
VI want you to hold it there just for a moment,
p302
aVand I only want you to allow your hand
p303
aVto sink and drift and float back to the tabletop
p304
aVat the same rate and speed
p305
aVas you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness,
p306
aVand allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop.
p307
aVThat's it, all the way down, all the way down.
p308
aVand further, and further.
p309
aVExcellent.
p310
aVI want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop.
p311
aVOK, now, allow it to stay there.
p312
aa(lp313
VOK, now, in a moment, you'll feel a certain pressure, OK,
p314
aVand I want you to be aware of the pressure.
p315
aVJust be aware of the pressure.
p316
aVAnd I only want you to allow your hand
p317
aVto float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release,
p318
aVbut only when you feel the pressure release.
p319
aVDo you understand? Just answer yes or no.
p320
aa(lp321
VMan: Yes.
p322
aa(lp323
VKB: Hold it right there.
p324
aVAnd only when you feel the pressure go back,
p325
aVallow your hand to drift back to the tabletop,
p326
aVbut only when you feel the pressure.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VOK, that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again.
p331
aa(lp332
VExcellent. Now that you've got the idea, let's try something even more interesting.
p333
aVAllow it to stick firmly to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed.
p334
aVCan you stand up? Just stand, stage forward.
p335
aVI want you to point directly at his forehead.
p336
aVOK.
p337
aVImagine a connection between you and him.
p338
aVOnly when you want the pressure to be released,
p339
aVmake an upward gesture, like this,
p340
aVbut only when you want it to be released.
p341
aVYou can wait as long as you want,
p342
aVbut only when you want the pressure released.
p343
aVOK, let's try it again.
p344
aVOK, now, imagine the connection, OK.
p345
aVPoint directly at his forehead.
p346
aVOnly when you want the pressure released, we'll try it again.
p347
aa(lp348
VOK, it worked that time, excellent.
p349
aVAnd hold it there, both of you.
p350
aVOnly when you want the pressure to go back, make a downward gesture.
p351
aVYou can wait as long as you want.
p352
aVYou did it pretty quickly, but it went down, OK.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow, I want you to be aware that in a moment,
p355
aVwhen I snap my fingers, your eyes will open, again.
p356
aVIt's OK to remember to forget, or forget to remember what happened.
p357
aVMost people ask you, "What the hell just happened up here?"
p358
aVBut it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized,
p359
aVyou will forget everything that happened.
p360
aVOn five, four, three, two, one \u2014 open your eyes, wide awake.
p361
aVGive them a round of applause, as they go back to their seats.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)
p364
aa(lp365
VOK, you can go back.
p366
aa(lp367
V(Applause)
p368
aa(lp369
VI once saw a film called "The Gods Are Crazy."
p370
aVHas anybody here seen that film? Yeah.
p371
aVRemember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane,
p372
aVand it landed on the ground, and it didn't break?
p373
aVNow, see, that's because Coke bottles are solid.
p374
aVIt's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle.
p375
aVDo you want to try it?
p376
aVGood job. She's not taking any chances.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
VYou see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence
p381
aVof the mind on physical events and processes.
p382
aVFor some magicians or mentalists,
p383
aVsometimes the spoon will bend or melt, sometimes it will not.
p384
aVSometimes the object will slide across the table, sometimes it will not.
p385
aVIt depends on how much energy you have that day,
p386
aVso on and so forth.
p387
aa(lp388
VWe're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis, right now.
p389
aVCome right over here, next to me. Excellent.
p390
aVNow, have a look at the Coke bottle.
p391
aVMake sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.
p392
aVAnd you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful.
p393
aVEven though it's solid, I'm standing away.
p394
aVI want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb.
p395
aVExcellent. Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK.
p396
aVI want you to examine the shard of glass.
p397
aVCareful, it's sharp. Just hold on to it for a moment.
p398
aVNow, hold it out here.
p399
aa(lp400
VI want you to imagine, right now, a broken relationship from many years ago.
p401
aVI want you to imagine all the negative energy
p402
aVfrom that broken relationship, from that guy,
p403
aVbeing imparted into the broken piece of glass,
p404
aVwhich will represent him, OK.
p405
aVBut I want you to take this very seriously.
p406
aVStare at the glass, ignore everybody right here.
p407
aVIn a moment, you'll feel a certain sensation, OK,
p408
aVand when you feel that sensation,
p409
aVI want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle.
p410
aVThink of that guy, that ba \u2014 that guy.
p411
aa(lp412
V(Laughter)
p413
aa(lp414
VI'm trying to be good here.
p415
aVOK, and when you feel the sensation \u2014
p416
aVit might take a while \u2014 drop it into the glass.
p417
aVOK, drop it in.
p418
aa(lp419
VNow, imagine all that negative energy in there.
p420
aVImagine his name and imagine him inside the glass.
p421
aVAnd I want you to release that negative energy
p422
aVby shaking it from side to side.
p423
aa(lp424
V(Burst)
p425
aa(lp426
V(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
VThat was a lot of negative energy, built up in there.
p429
aa(lp430
V(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
V(Applause)
p433
aa(lp434
VI also want you to look at me and think of his name.
p435
aVOK, think of how many letters in the title of his name.
p436
aVThere's five letters in the title.
p437
aVYou didn't react to that, so it's four letters.
p438
aVThink of one of the letters in the title.
p439
aVThere's a K in his name, there is a K.
p440
aVI knew that because my name starts with a K also,
p441
aVbut his name doesn't start with a K, it starts with an M.
p442
aVTell Mike I said hello, the next time you see him.
p443
aa(lp444
VWas that his name? Nicole: Mm-hmm.
p445
aa(lp446
VKB: OK, give her a round of applause.
p447
aa(lp448
V(Applause)
p449
aa(lp450
VThank you.
p451
aa(lp452
V(Applause)
p453
aa(lp454
V(Applause ends)
p455
aa(lp456
VI've got one more thing to share with you right now.
p457
aVActually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this,
p458
aVbut instead of picking you, can you hop up here
p459
aVand pick a victim for this next experiment?
p460
aVAnd it should be a male victim, that's the only thing.
p461
aa(lp462
VChris Anderson: Oh, OK.
p463
aa(lp464
VKB: I was going to use you,
p465
aVbut I decided I might want to come back another year.
p466
aa(lp467
V(Laughter)
p468
aa(lp469
VCA: Well, to reward him for saying "eureka,"
p470
aVand for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us \u2014 Steve Jurvetson.
p471
aa(lp472
VKB: OK, Steve, come on up here.
p473
aa(lp474
V(Applause)
p475
aa(lp476
VCA: You knew!
p477
aa(lp478
VKB: OK, Steve, I want you to take a seat, right behind here. Excellent.
p479
aVNow, Steve \u2014 oh, you can check underneath.
p480
aVGo ahead, I've no fancy assistants underneath there.
p481
aVThey insist that because I was a magician,
p482
aVput a nice, black tablecloth on.
p483
aVThere you are, OK.
p484
aa(lp485
V(Laughter)
p486
aa(lp487
VI've got four wooden plinths here, Steve.
p488
aVOne, two, three and four.
p489
aVNow, they're all the exact same except this one
p490
aVobviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it.
p491
aVI want you to examine it, and make sure it's solid.
p492
aVHappy?
p493
aa(lp494
VSteve Jurvetson: Mmm, yes.
p495
aa(lp496
VKB: OK. Now, Steve, I'm going to stand in front of the table,
p497
aVWhen I stand in front of the table,
p498
aVI want you to put the cups on the plinths,
p499
aVin any order you want, and then mix them all up,
p500
aVso nobody has any idea where the spike is, all right?
p501
aa(lp502
VSJ: No one in the audience?
p503
aa(lp504
VKB: Yes, and just to help you out,
p505
aVI'll block them from view, so nobody can see what you're doing.
p506
aVI'll also look away. So, go ahead and mix them up, now.
p507
aVOK, and tell me when you're done.
p508
aa(lp509
V(Laughter)
p510
aa(lp511
V(Laughter)
p512
aa(lp513
VKB: You done? SJ: Almost.
p514
aa(lp515
VKB: Almost, oh. OK, you're making sure that's well hidden.
p516
aVOh, we've got one here, we've got one here.
p517
aa(lp518
V(Applause)
p519
aa(lp520
VSo, all right, we'll leave them like that.
p521
aa(lp522
V(Laughter)
p523
aa(lp524
VI'm going to have the last laugh, though.
p525
aa(lp526
V(Laughter)
p527
aa(lp528
VNow, Steve, you know where the spike is, but nobody else, does? Correct?
p529
aVBut I don't want you to know either, so swivel around on your chair.
p530
aVThey'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny.
p531
aVNo, stay around, OK.
p532
aVNow, Steve, look back.
p533
aVNow you don't know where the spike is, and I don't know where it is either.
p534
aVNow, is there any way to see through this blindfold?
p535
aa(lp536
VSJ: Put this on?
p537
aa(lp538
VKB: No, just, is there any way to see through it? No?
p539
aa(lp540
VSJ: No, I can't see through it. KB: Excellent.
p541
aVNow, I'm going to put on the blindfold.
p542
aVDon't stack them up, OK. Give them an extra mix up.
p543
aVDon't move the cups, I don't want anybody to see where the spike is,
p544
aVbut give the plinths an extra mix up, and then line them up.
p545
aVI'll put the blindfold on. Give them an extra mix up.
p546
aVNo messing around this time. OK, go ahead, mix them up.
p547
aVMy hand is at risk here.
p548
aa(lp549
V(Laughter)
p550
aa(lp551
VTell me when you're done. SJ: Done.
p552
aa(lp553
VKB: OK, where are you? Put out your hand. Your right hand.
p554
aVTell me when I'm over a cup.
p555
aa(lp556
VSJ: You're over a cup. KB: I'm over a cup, right now?
p557
aa(lp558
VSJ: Mm-hmm.
p559
aa(lp560
VKB: Now, Steve, do you think it's here? Yes or no?
p561
aa(lp562
VSJ: Oh!
p563
aa(lp564
V(Laughter)
p565
aa(lp566
VKB: I told you I'd have the last laugh.
p567
aa(lp568
V(Laughter)
p569
aa(lp570
VSJ: I don't think it's there. KB: No? Good decision.
p571
aa(lp572
V(Laughter)
p573
aa(lp574
V(Applause)
p575
aa(lp576
V(Applause ends)
p577
aa(lp578
VNow, if I go this way, is there another cup over here?
p579
aa(lp580
VSJ: Can we do the left hand?
p581
aa(lp582
VKB: Oh, no, no, no. He asked me could he do the left hand. Absolutely not.
p583
aa(lp584
V(Laughter)
p585
aa(lp586
VKB: If I go this way, is there another cup?
p587
aa(lp588
VSJ: Yes. KB: Tell me when to stop.
p589
aa(lp590
VSJ: OK. KB: There?
p591
aa(lp592
VSJ: Yes, there's one.
p593
aa(lp594
VKB: OK. Do you think it's here, yes or no? This is your decision, not mine.
p595
aa(lp596
V(Laughter)
p597
aa(lp598
VSJ: I'm going to say no. KB: Good decision.
p599
aa(lp600
V(Laughter)
p601
aa(lp602
VOK, give me both hands.
p603
aVNow, put them on both cups.
p604
aVDo you think the spike is under your left or your right hand?
p605
aa(lp606
VSJ: Neither.
p607
aa(lp608
VKB: Neither, oh, OK.
p609
aVBut if you were to guess.
p610
aa(lp611
V(Laughter)
p612
aa(lp613
VSJ: Under my right hand. KB: Under your right hand?
p614
aVNow, remember, you made all the decisions all along.
p615
aVPsychologists, figure this out.
p616
aa(lp617
V(SJ gasps)
p618
aa(lp619
VHave a look.
p620
aa(lp621
VSJ: Oh!
p622
aa(lp623
V(Applause)
p624
aa(lp625
VKB: Thank you.
p626
aa(lp627

p628
aVIf anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on,
p629
aVI'll be outside.
p630
aVThank you.

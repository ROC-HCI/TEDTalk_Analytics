VWell, I have a big announcement to make today,
p5
aVand I'm really excited about this.
p6
aVAnd this may be a little bit of a surprise
p7
aVto many of you who know my research
p8
aVand what I've done well.
p9
aVI've really tried to solve some big problems:
p10
aVcounterterrorism, nuclear terrorism,
p11
aVand health care and diagnosing and treating cancer,
p12
aVbut I started thinking about all these problems,
p13
aVand I realized that the really biggest problem we face,
p14
aVwhat all these other problems come down to,
p15
aVis energy, is electricity, the flow of electrons.
p16
aVAnd I decided that I was going to set out
p17
aVto try to solve this problem.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd this probably is not what you're expecting.
p20
aVYou're probably expecting me to come up here
p21
aVand talk about fusion,
p22
aVbecause that's what I've done most of my life.
p23
aVBut this is actually a talk about, okay \u2014
p24
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p25
aVbut this is actually a talk about fission.
p26
aVIt's about perfecting something old,
p27
aVand bringing something old into the 21st century.
p28
aa(lp29
VLet's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works.
p30
aVIn a nuclear power plant, you have
p31
aVa big pot of water that's under high pressure,
p32
aVand you have some fuel rods,
p33
aVand these fuel rods are encased in zirconium,
p34
aVand they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel,
p35
aVand a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level,
p36
aVand that reaction heats up water,
p37
aVthe water turns to steam, steam turns the turbine,
p38
aVand you produce electricity from it.
p39
aVThis is the same way we've been producing electricity,
p40
aVthe steam turbine idea, for 100 years,
p41
aVand nuclear was a really big advancement
p42
aVin a way to heat the water,
p43
aVbut you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd I thought, you know, is this the best way to do it?
p46
aVIs fission kind of played out,
p47
aVor is there something left to innovate here?
p48
aVAnd I realized that I had hit upon something
p49
aVthat I think has this huge potential to change the world.
p50
aVAnd this is what it is.
p51
aa(lp52
VThis is a small modular reactor.
p53
aVSo it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here.
p54
aVThis is between 50 and 100 megawatts.
p55
aVBut that's a ton of power.
p56
aVThat's between, say at an average use,
p57
aVthat's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that.
p58
aVNow the really interesting thing about these reactors
p59
aVis they're built in a factory.
p60
aVSo they're modular reactors that are built
p61
aVessentially on an assembly line,
p62
aVand they're trucked anywhere in the world,
p63
aVyou plop them down, and they produce electricity.
p64
aVThis region right here is the reactor.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd this is buried below ground, which is really important.
p67
aVFor someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work,
p68
aVI can't extol to you
p69
aVhow great having something buried below the ground is
p70
aVfor proliferation and security concerns.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd inside this reactor is a molten salt,
p73
aVso anybody who's a fan of thorium,
p74
aVthey're going to be really excited about this,
p75
aVbecause these reactors happen to be really good
p76
aVat breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle,
p77
aVuranium-233.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut I'm not really concerned about the fuel.
p80
aVYou can run these off \u2014 they're really hungry,
p81
aVthey really like down-blended weapons pits,
p82
aVso that's highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium
p83
aVthat's been down-blended.
p84
aVIt's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon,
p85
aVbut they love this stuff.
p86
aVAnd we have a lot of it sitting around,
p87
aVbecause this is a big problem.
p88
aVYou know, in the Cold War, we built up this huge arsenal
p89
aVof nuclear weapons, and that was great,
p90
aVand we don't need them anymore,
p91
aVand what are we doing with all the waste, essentially?
p92
aVWhat are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons?
p93
aVWell, we're securing them, and it would be great
p94
aVif we could burn them, eat them up,
p95
aVand this reactor loves this stuff.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core,
p98
aVand it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt,
p99
aVthe radioactive salt, to a cold salt which isn't radioactive.
p100
aVIt's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive.
p101
aVAnd then that's a heat exchanger
p102
aVto what makes this design really, really interesting,
p103
aVand that's a heat exchanger to a gas.
p104
aVSo going back to what I was saying before about all power
p105
aVbeing produced \u2014 well, other than photovoltaic \u2014
p106
aVbeing produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine,
p107
aVthat's actually not that efficient, and in fact,
p108
aVin a nuclear power plant like this,
p109
aVit's only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient.
p110
aVThat's how much thermal energy the reactor's putting out
p111
aVto how much electricity it's producing.
p112
aVAnd the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors
p113
aVoperate at pretty low temperature.
p114
aVThey operate anywhere from, you know,
p115
aVmaybe 200 to 300 degrees Celsius.
p116
aVAnd these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees Celsius,
p117
aVwhich means the higher the temperature you go to,
p118
aVthermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies.
p119
aVAnd this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas,
p120
aVso supercritical CO2 or helium,
p121
aVand that goes into a turbine,
p122
aVand this is called the Brayton cycle.
p123
aVThis is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity,
p124
aVand this makes this almost 50 percent efficient,
p125
aVbetween 45 and 50 percent efficiency.
p126
aVAnd I'm really excited about this,
p127
aVbecause it's a very compact core.
p128
aVMolten salt reactors are very compact by nature,
p129
aVbut what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out
p130
aVfor how much uranium you're fissioning,
p131
aVnot to mention the fact that these burn up.
p132
aVTheir burn-up is much higher.
p133
aVSo for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor,
p134
aVa lot more of it's being used.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this
p137
aVis, you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium,
p138
aVand inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets.
p139
aVWell, uranium dioxide's a ceramic,
p140
aVand ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it.
p141
aVSo you have what's called the xenon pit,
p142
aVand so some of these fission products love neutrons.
p143
aVThey love the neutrons that are going on
p144
aVand helping this reaction take place.
p145
aVAnd they eat them up, which means that, combined with
p146
aVthe fact that the cladding doesn't last very long,
p147
aVyou can only run one of these reactors
p148
aVfor roughly, say, 18 months without refueling it.
p149
aVSo these reactors run for 30 years without refueling,
p150
aVwhich is, in my opinion, very, very amazing,
p151
aVbecause it means it's a sealed system.
p152
aVNo refueling means you can seal them up
p153
aVand they're not going to be a proliferation risk,
p154
aVand they're not going to have
p155
aVeither nuclear material or radiological material
p156
aVproliferated from their cores.
p157
aa(lp158
VBut let's go back to safety, because everybody
p159
aVafter Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear,
p160
aVand one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor
p161
aVwas it had to be passively and intrinsically safe,
p162
aVand I'm really excited about this reactor
p163
aVfor essentially two reasons.
p164
aVOne, it doesn't operate at high pressure.
p165
aVSo traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor
p166
aVor boiling water reactor, they're very, very hot water
p167
aVat very high pressures, and this means, essentially,
p168
aVin the event of an accident, if you had any kind of breach
p169
aVof this stainless steel pressure vessel,
p170
aVthe coolant would leave the core.
p171
aVThese reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure,
p172
aVso there's no inclination for the fission products
p173
aVto leave the reactor in the event of an accident.
p174
aVAlso, they operate at high temperatures,
p175
aVand the fuel is molten, so they can't melt down,
p176
aVbut in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances,
p177
aVor you lost off-site power in the case
p178
aVof something like Fukushima, there's a dump tank.
p179
aVBecause your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant,
p180
aVyou could actually just drain the core
p181
aVinto what's called a sub-critical setting,
p182
aVbasically a tank underneath the reactor
p183
aVthat has some neutrons absorbers.
p184
aVAnd this is really important, because the reaction stops.
p185
aVIn this kind of reactor, you can't do that.
p186
aVThe fuel, like I said, is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods,
p187
aVand in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors,
p188
aVFukushima and Three Mile Island \u2014
p189
aVlooking back at Three Mile Island, we didn't really see this for a while \u2014
p190
aVbut these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods,
p191
aVwhat happens is, when they see high pressure water,
p192
aVsteam, in an oxidizing environment,
p193
aVthey'll actually produce hydrogen,
p194
aVand that hydrogen has this explosive capability
p195
aVto release fission products.
p196
aVSo the core of this reactor, since it's not under pressure
p197
aVand it doesn't have this chemical reactivity,
p198
aVmeans that there's no inclination for the fission products
p199
aVto leave this reactor.
p200
aVSo even in the event of an accident,
p201
aVyeah, the reactor may be toast, which is, you know,
p202
aVsorry for the power company,
p203
aVbut we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land.
p204
aVSo I really think that in the, say,
p205
aV20 years it's going to take us to get fusion
p206
aVand make fusion a reality,
p207
aVthis could be the source of energy
p208
aVthat provides carbon-free electricity.
p209
aVCarbon-free electricity.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd it's an amazing technology because
p212
aVnot only does it combat climate change,
p213
aVbut it's an innovation.
p214
aVIt's a way to bring power to the developing world,
p215
aVbecause it's produced in a factory and it's cheap.
p216
aVYou can put them anywhere in the world you want to.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd maybe something else.
p219
aVAs a kid, I was obsessed with space.
p220
aVWell, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point,
p221
aVbut before that I was obsessed with space,
p222
aVand I was really excited about, you know,
p223
aVbeing an astronaut and designing rockets,
p224
aVwhich was something that was always exciting to me.
p225
aVBut I think I get to come back to this,
p226
aVbecause imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket
p227
aVthat produces 50 to 100 megawatts.
p228
aVThat is the rocket designer's dream.
p229
aVThat's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream.
p230
aVNot only do you have 50 to 100 megawatts
p231
aVto power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there,
p232
aVbut you have power once you get there.
p233
aVYou know, rocket designers who use solar panels
p234
aVor fuel cells, I mean a few watts or kilowatts \u2014
p235
aVwow, that's a lot of power.
p236
aVI mean, now we're talking about 100 megawatts.
p237
aVThat's a ton of power.
p238
aVThat could power a Martian community.
p239
aVThat could power a rocket there.
p240
aVAnd so I hope that
p241
aVmaybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore
p242
aVmy rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd people say, "Oh, well, you've launched this thing,
p245
aVand it's radioactive, into space, and what about accidents?"
p246
aVBut we launch plutonium batteries all the time.
p247
aVEverybody was really excited about Curiosity,
p248
aVand that had this big plutonium battery on board
p249
aVthat has plutonium-238,
p250
aVwhich actually has a higher specific activity
p251
aVthan the low-enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors,
p252
aVwhich means that the effects would be negligible,
p253
aVbecause you launch it cold,
p254
aVand when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo I'm really excited.
p257
aVI think that I've designed this reactor here
p258
aVthat can be an innovative source of energy,
p259
aVprovide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications,
p260
aVand I'm really prepared to do this.
p261
aVI graduated high school in May, and \u2014
p262
aV(Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p263
aVI graduated high school in May,
p264
aVand I decided that I was going to start up a company
p265
aVto commercialize these technologies that I've developed,
p266
aVthese revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers
p267
aVand these systems to produce medical isotopes,
p268
aVbut I want to do this, and I've slowly been building up
p269
aVa team of some of the most incredible people
p270
aVI've ever had the chance to work with,
p271
aVand I'm really prepared to make this a reality.
p272
aVAnd I think, I think, that looking at the technology,
p273
aVthis will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas,
p274
aVand you don't have to refuel it for 30 years,
p275
aVwhich is an advantage for the developing world.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing
p278
aVto end with, which is weird for a scientist.
p279
aVBut I think there's something really poetic
p280
aVabout using nuclear power to propel us to the stars,
p281
aVbecause the stars are giant fusion reactors.
p282
aVThey're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky.
p283
aVThe energy that I'm able to talk to you today,
p284
aVwhile it was converted to chemical energy in my food,
p285
aVoriginally came from a nuclear reaction,
p286
aVand so there's something poetic about, in my opinion,
p287
aVperfecting nuclear fission
p288
aVand using it as a future source of innovative energy.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo thank you guys.

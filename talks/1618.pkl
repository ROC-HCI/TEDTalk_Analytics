VI'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist,
p5
aVI'm actually interested in how the brain learns,
p6
aVand I'm especially interested in a possibility of
p7
aVmaking our brains smarter, better and faster.
p8
aa(lp9
VThis is in this context I'm going to tell you
p10
aVabout video games. When we say video games,
p11
aVmost of you think about children.
p12
aVIt's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.
p13
aVBut let's be frank.
p14
aVWhen the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?
p15
aVMost of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old,
p16
aVnot eight years old, and in fact, if we look
p17
aVat the projected demographics of video game play,
p18
aVthe video game players of tomorrow are
p19
aVolder adults. (Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VSo video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.
p22
aVIt is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact
p23
aVon our everyday life. Consider these statistics
p24
aVreleased by Activision. After one month of release
p25
aVof the game "Call Of Duty: Black Ops," it had been played
p26
aVfor 68,000 years
p27
aVworldwide, right?
p28
aVWould any of you complain if this was the case
p29
aVabout doing linear algebra?
p30
aa(lp31
VSo what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?
p32
aVNow I want to step back a bit.
p33
aVI know most of you have had the experience of coming back
p34
aVhome and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.
p35
aV(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to get
p36
aVafter your enemy zombie bad guys
p37
aVbefore they get to you, right?
p38
aVAnd I'm almost sure most of you have thought,
p39
aV"Oh, come on, can't you do something more intelligent
p40
aVthan shooting at zombies?"
p41
aVI'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction
p42
aVin the context of what you would have thought
p43
aVif you had found your girl playing sudoku
p44
aVor your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?
p45
aVMost parents would find that great.
p46
aVWell, I'm not going to tell you that playing video games
p47
aVdays in and days out is actually good for your health.
p48
aVIt's not, and binging is never good.
p49
aVBut I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses,
p50
aVactually the very game I showed you at the beginning,
p51
aVthose action-packed shooter games
p52
aVhave quite powerful effects and positive effects
p53
aVon many different aspects of our behavior.
p54
aa(lp55
VThere's not one week that goes without some major
p56
aVheadlines in the media about whether video games are
p57
aVgood or bad for you, right? You're all bombarded with that.
p58
aVI'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside
p59
aVand get you to actually step into the lab.
p60
aVWhat we do in the lab is actually measure directly,
p61
aVin a quantitative fashion, what is the impact
p62
aVof video games on the brain.
p63
aVAnd so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.
p64
aa(lp65
VOne first saying that I'm sure you all have heard
p66
aVis the fact that too much screen time
p67
aVmakes your eyesight worse.
p68
aVThat's a statement about vision.
p69
aVThere may be vision scientists among you.
p70
aVWe actually know how to test that statement.
p71
aVWe can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.
p72
aVWell, guess what? People that don't play a lot
p73
aVof action games, that don't actually spend a lot of time
p74
aVin front of screens, have normal, or what we call
p75
aVcorrective-to-normal vision. That's okay.
p76
aVThe issue is what happens with these guys that actually
p77
aVindulge into playing video games like five hours per week,
p78
aV10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.
p79
aVBy that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?
p80
aVGuess what? Their vision is really, really good.
p81
aVIt's better than those that don't play.
p82
aVAnd it's better in two different ways.
p83
aVThe first way is that they're actually able to resolve
p84
aVsmall detail in the context of clutter, and though that means
p85
aVbeing able to read the fine print on a prescription
p86
aVrather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it
p87
aVwith just your eyesight.
p88
aVThe other way that they are better is actually being able
p89
aVto resolve different levels of gray.
p90
aVImagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference
p91
aVbetween seeing the car in front of you
p92
aVand avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.
p93
aVSo we're actually leveraging that work to develop games
p94
aVfor patients with low vision, and to have an impact
p95
aVon retraining their brain to see better.
p96
aVClearly, when it comes to action video games,
p97
aVscreen time doesn't make your eyesight worse.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnother saying that I'm sure you have all heard around:
p100
aVVideo games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.
p101
aVOkay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.
p102
aVI'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.
p103
aVI'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have
p104
aVto actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you
p105
aVcolored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.
p106
aVRight? So this is the first example.
p107
aV["Chair"]
p108
aVOrange, good. ["Table"] Green.
p109
aV["Board"] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red.
p110
aV["Horse"] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow.
p111
aV["Yellow"] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.
p112
aV["Blue"] DB: Yellow.
p113
aVOkay, you get my point, right? (Laughter)
p114
aVYou're getting better, but it's hard. Why is it hard?
p115
aVBecause I introduced a conflict between
p116
aVthe word itself and its color.
p117
aVHow good your attention is determines actually how fast
p118
aVyou resolve that conflict, so the young guys here
p119
aVat the top of their game probably, like, did a little better
p120
aVthan some of us that are older.
p121
aVWhat we can show is that when you do this kind of task
p122
aVwith people that play a lot of action games,
p123
aVthey actually resolve the conflict faster.
p124
aVSo clearly playing those action games doesn't lead
p125
aVto attention problems.
p126
aa(lp127
VActually, those action video game players have
p128
aVmany other advantages in terms of attention, and one
p129
aVaspect of attention which is also improved for the better
p130
aVis our ability to track objects around in the world.
p131
aVThis is something we use all the time. When you're driving,
p132
aVyou're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.
p133
aVYou're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog,
p134
aVand that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?
p135
aa(lp136
VIn the lab, we get people to come to the lab,
p137
aVsit in front of a computer screen, and we give them
p138
aVlittle tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.
p139
aVYou're going to see yellow happy faces
p140
aVand a few sad blue faces. These are children
p141
aVin the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess
p142
aVduring the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess.
p143
aVBut a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat.
p144
aVEverybody begins to move around, and your task
p145
aVis to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning
p146
aVand who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example
p147
aVwhere there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can
p148
aVactually track it with your eyes. You can track,
p149
aVyou can track, and then when it stops, and there is
p150
aVa question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?
p151
aVWas it yellow initially or blue?
p152
aVI hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter)
p153
aVI'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with
p154
aVa little more challenging task. There are going to be
p155
aVthree of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes.
p156
aVPlease don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated
p157
aVand expand, pull your attention. That's the only way
p158
aVyou can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed.
p159
aVYellow or blue?
p160
aVAudience: Yellow.DB: Good.
p161
aVSo your typical normal young adult
p162
aVcan have a span of about three or four objects of attention.
p163
aVThat's what we just did. Your action video game player
p164
aVhas a span of about six to seven objects of attention,
p165
aVwhich is what is shown in this video here.
p166
aVThat's for you guys, action video game players.
p167
aVA bit more challenging, right? (Laughter)
p168
aVYellow or blue? Blue. We have some people
p169
aVthat are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VGood. So in the same way that we actually see
p172
aVthe effects of video games on people's behavior,
p173
aVwe can use brain imaging and look at the impact
p174
aVof video games on the brain, and we do find many changes,
p175
aVbut the main changes are actually to the brain networks
p176
aVthat control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex
p177
aVwhich is very well known to control the orientation of attention.
p178
aVThe other one is the frontal lobe, which controls
p179
aVhow we sustain attention, and another one
p180
aVis the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate
p181
aVand regulate attention and resolve conflict.
p182
aVNow, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three
p183
aVof these networks are actually much more efficient
p184
aVin people that play action games.
p185
aa(lp186
VThis actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding
p187
aVin the literature about technology and the brain.
p188
aVYou all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty
p189
aVof multitasking when you're driving
p190
aVand you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.
p191
aVWhy? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone,
p192
aVyou are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly
p193
aVto the car braking in front of you, and so you're
p194
aVmuch more likely to get engaged into a car accident.
p195
aVNow, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.
p196
aVWe obviously don't ask people to drive around and see
p197
aVhow many car accidents they have. That would be a little
p198
aVcostly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer
p199
aVwhere we can measure, to millisecond accuracy,
p200
aVhow good they are at switching from one task to another.
p201
aVWhen we do that, we actually find that people
p202
aVthat play a lot of action games are really, really good.
p203
aVThey switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow I'd like you to remember that result, and put it
p206
aVin the context of another group of technology users,
p207
aVa group which is actually much revered by society,
p208
aVwhich are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
p209
aVWhat is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us,
p210
aVmost of our children, are engaged with listening to music
p211
aVat the same time as they're doing search on the web
p212
aVat the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.
p213
aVThat's a multimedia-tasker.
p214
aVThere was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford
p215
aVand that we replicated that showed that
p216
aVthose people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers
p217
aVare absolutely abysmal at multitasking.
p218
aVWhen we measure them in the lab, they're really bad.
p219
aa(lp220
VRight? So these kinds of results really
p221
aVmakes two main points.
p222
aVThe first one is that not all media are created equal.
p223
aVYou can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking
p224
aVand the effect of playing action games. They have
p225
aVtotally different effects on different aspects of cognition,
p226
aVperception and attention.
p227
aVEven within video games, I'm telling you right now
p228
aVabout these action-packed video games.
p229
aVDifferent video games have a different effect on your brains.
p230
aVSo we actually need to step into the lab and really measure
p231
aVwhat is the effect of each video game.
p232
aa(lp233
VThe other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.
p234
aVI showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that
p235
aVdespite a lot of screen time, those action gamers
p236
aVhave a lot of very good vision, etc.
p237
aVHere, what was really striking is that these undergraduates
p238
aVthat actually report engaging in a lot of high
p239
aVmultimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.
p240
aVSo you show them their data, you show them they are bad
p241
aVand they're like, "Not possible." You know, they have
p242
aVthis sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.
p243
aVThat's another argument for why we need to step into the lab
p244
aVand really measure the impact of technology on the brain.
p245
aa(lp246
VNow in a sense, when we think about the effect
p247
aVof video games on the brain, it's very similar
p248
aVto the effect of wine on the health.
p249
aVThere are some very poor uses of wine. There are some
p250
aVvery poor uses of video games. But when consumed
p251
aVin reasonable doses, and at the right age,
p252
aVwine can be very good for health. There are actually
p253
aVspecific molecules that have been identified
p254
aVin red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.
p255
aVSo it's the same way, like those action video games
p256
aVhave a number of ingredients that are actually really
p257
aVpowerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention,
p258
aVvision, etc., and so we need and we're working on
p259
aVunderstanding what are those active ingredients so that
p260
aVwe can really then leverage them to deliver better games,
p261
aVeither for education or for rehabilitation of patients.
p262
aa(lp263
VNow because we are interested in having an impact
p264
aVfor education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually
p265
aVnot that interested in how those of you that choose
p266
aVto play video games for many hours on end perform.
p267
aVI'm much more interested in taking any of you
p268
aVand showing that by forcing you to play an action game,
p269
aVI can actually change your vision for the better,
p270
aVwhether you want to play that action game or not, right?
p271
aVThat's the point of rehabilitation or education.
p272
aVMost of the kids don't go to school saying,
p273
aV"Great, two hours of math!"
p274
aa(lp275
VSo that's really the crux of the research, and to do that,
p276
aVwe need to go one more step.
p277
aVAnd one more step is to do training studies.
p278
aVSo let me illustrate that step with
p279
aVa task which is called mental rotation.
p280
aVMental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you,
p281
aVand again you're going to do the task,
p282
aVto look at this shape. Study it, it's a target shape,
p283
aVand I'm going to present to you four different shapes.
p284
aVOne of these four different shapes is actually a rotated
p285
aVversion of this shape. I want you to tell me which one:
p286
aVthe first one, second one, third one or fourth one?
p287
aVOkay, I'll help you. Fourth one.
p288
aVOne more. Get those brains working. Come on.
p289
aVThat's our target shape.
p290
aVThird. Good! This is hard, right?
p291
aVLike, the reason that I asked you to do that is because
p292
aVyou really feel your brain cringing, right?
p293
aVIt doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.
p294
aa(lp295
VWell, what we do in these training studies is, people
p296
aVcome to the lab, they do tasks like this one,
p297
aVwe then force them to play 10 hours of action games.
p298
aVThey don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.
p299
aVThey do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes
p300
aVseveral days over a period of two weeks.
p301
aVThen, once they are done with the training, they come back
p302
aVa few days later and they are tested again on a similar type
p303
aVof mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague
p304
aVin Toronto. What they showed is that, initially,
p305
aVyou know, subjects perform where they are expected
p306
aVto perform given their age. After two weeks of training
p307
aVon action video games, they actually perform better,
p308
aVand the improvement is still there five months after
p309
aVhaving done the training. That's really, really important.
p310
aVWhy? Because I told you we want to use these games
p311
aVfor education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects
p312
aVthat are going to be long-lasting.
p313
aa(lp314
VNow, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering
p315
aVwell, what are you waiting for, to put on the market
p316
aVa game that would be good for the attention
p317
aVof my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy,
p318
aVor a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision
p319
aVof my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?
p320
aa(lp321
VWell, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.
p322
aVThere are brain scientists like me that are beginning
p323
aVto understand what are the good ingredients in games
p324
aVto promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going
p325
aVto call the broccoli side of the equation.
p326
aVThere is an entertainment software industry
p327
aVwhich is extremely deft at coming up with
p328
aVappealing products that you can't resist.
p329
aVThat's the chocolate side of the equation.
p330
aVThe issue is we need to put the two together,
p331
aVand it's a little bit like with food.
p332
aVWho really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
p333
aVNone of you. (Laughter) And you probably have had
p334
aVthat feeling, right, picking up an education game
p335
aVand sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun,
p336
aVit's not really engaging. So what we need
p337
aVis really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate
p338
aVthat is irresistible, that you really want to play,
p339
aVbut that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients
p340
aVthat are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize
p341
aVbut are still working on your brains. And we're working on it,
p342
aVbut it takes brain scientists to come and to get together,
p343
aVpeople that work in the entertainment software industry,
p344
aVand publishers, so these are not people that usually
p345
aVmeet every day, but it's actually doable,
p346
aVand we are on the right track.
p347
aVI'd like to leave you with that thought,
p348
aVand thank you for your attention. (Applause)
p349
aV(Applause)

VI'd like to reimagine education.
p5
aVThe last year
p6
aVhas seen the invention of a new four-letter word.
p7
aVIt starts with an M.
p8
aVMOOC: massive open online courses.
p9
aVMany organizations
p10
aVare offering these online courses
p11
aVto students all over the world, in the millions, for free.
p12
aVAnybody who has an Internet connection
p13
aVand the will to learn can access these great courses
p14
aVfrom excellent universities
p15
aVand get a credential at the end of it.
p16
aVNow, in this discussion today,
p17
aVI'm going to focus
p18
aVon a different aspect of MOOCs.
p19
aVWe are taking what we are learning
p20
aVand the technologies we are developing in the large
p21
aVand applying them in the small
p22
aVto create a blended model of education
p23
aVto really reinvent and reimagine
p24
aVwhat we do in the classroom.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, our classrooms could use change.
p27
aVSo, here's a classroom
p28
aVat this little three-letter institute
p29
aVin the Northeast of America, MIT.
p30
aVAnd this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago,
p31
aVand this is a classroom today.
p32
aVWhat's changed?
p33
aVThe seats are in color.
p34
aVWhoop-de-do.
p35
aVEducation really hasn't changed
p36
aVin the past 500 years.
p37
aVThe last big innovation in education
p38
aVwas the printing press and the textbooks.
p39
aVEverything else has changed around us.
p40
aVYou know, from healthcare to transportation,
p41
aVeverything is different, but education hasn't changed.
p42
aa(lp43
VIt's also been a real issue in terms of access.
p44
aVSo what you see here
p45
aVis not a rock concert.
p46
aVAnd the person you see at the end of the stage
p47
aVis not Madonna.
p48
aVThis is a classroom
p49
aVat the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.
p50
aVNow, we've all heard of distance education,
p51
aVbut the students way in the back,
p52
aV200 feet away from the instructor,
p53
aVI think they are undergoing long-distance education.
p54
aVNow, I really believe
p55
aVthat we can transform education,
p56
aVboth in quality and scale and access,
p57
aVthrough technology.
p58
aVFor example, at edX,
p59
aVwe are trying to transform education
p60
aVthrough online technologies.
p61
aVGiven education has been calcified for 500 years,
p62
aVwe really cannot think about reengineering it,
p63
aVmicromanaging it.
p64
aVWe really have to completely reimagine it.
p65
aVIt's like going from ox carts to the airplane.
p66
aVEven the infrastructure has to change.
p67
aVEverything has to change.
p68
aVWe need to go from lectures on the blackboard
p69
aVto online exercises, online videos.
p70
aVWe have to go to interactive virtual laboratories
p71
aVand gamification.
p72
aVWe have to go to completely online grading
p73
aVand peer interaction and discussion boards.
p74
aVEverything really has to change.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo at edX and a number of other organizations,
p77
aVwe are applying these technologies to education
p78
aVthrough MOOCs to really increase access to education.
p79
aVAnd you heard of this example,
p80
aVwhere, when we launched our very first course \u2014
p81
aVand this was an MIT-hard
p82
aVcircuits and electronics course \u2014
p83
aVabout a year and a half ago,
p84
aV155,000 students from 162 countries
p85
aVenrolled in this course.
p86
aVAnd we had no marketing budget.
p87
aVNow, 155,000 is a big number.
p88
aVThis number is bigger
p89
aVthan the total number of alumni of MIT
p90
aVin its 150-year history.
p91
aV7,200 students passed the course,
p92
aVand this was a hard course.
p93
aV7,200 is also a big number.
p94
aVIf I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year,
p95
aVI would have to teach for 40 years
p96
aVbefore I could teach this many students.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow these large numbers
p99
aVare just one part of the story.
p100
aVSo today, I want to discuss a different aspect,
p101
aVthe other side of MOOCs,
p102
aVtake a different perspective.
p103
aVWe are taking what we develop and learn in the large
p104
aVand applying it in the small
p105
aVto the classroom, to create a blended model of learning.
p106
aa(lp107
VBut before I go into that, let me tell you a story.
p108
aVWhen my daughter turned 13, became a teenager,
p109
aVshe stopped speaking English,
p110
aVand she began speaking this new language.
p111
aVI call it teen-lish.
p112
aVIt's a digital language.
p113
aVIt's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence.
p114
aa(lp115
V"Honey, come over for dinner."
p116
aa(lp117
V"Hmm."
p118
aa(lp119
V"Did you hear me?"
p120
aa(lp121
VSilence. (Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
V"Can you listen to me?"
p124
aa(lp125
V"Hmm."
p126
aa(lp127
VSo we had a real issue with communicating,
p128
aVand we were just not communicating,
p129
aVuntil one day I had this epiphany.
p130
aVI texted her. (Laughter)
p131
aVI got an instant response.
p132
aVI said, no, that must have been by accident.
p133
aVShe must have thought, you know,
p134
aVsome friend of hers was calling her.
p135
aVSo I texted her again. Boom, another response.
p136
aVI said, this is great.
p137
aVAnd so since then, our life has changed.
p138
aVI text her, she responds.
p139
aVIt's just been absolutely great.
p140
aV(Applause)
p141
aa(lp142
VSo our millennial generation
p143
aVis built differently.
p144
aVNow, I'm older, and my youthful looks might belie that,
p145
aVbut I'm not in the millennial generation.
p146
aVBut our kids are really different.
p147
aVThe millennial generation is completely comfortable
p148
aVwith online technology.
p149
aVSo why are we fighting it in the classroom?
p150
aVLet's not fight it. Let's embrace it.
p151
aVIn fact, I believe \u2014 and I have two fat thumbs,
p152
aVI can't text very well \u2014
p153
aVbut I'm willing to bet that with evolution,
p154
aVour kids and their grandchildren
p155
aVwill develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs
p156
aVto text much better,
p157
aVthat evolution will fix all of that stuff.
p158
aVBut what if we embraced technology,
p159
aVembraced the millennial generation's
p160
aVnatural predilections,
p161
aVand really think about creating these online technologies,
p162
aVblend them into their lives.
p163
aVSo here's what we can do.
p164
aVSo rather than driving our kids into a classroom,
p165
aVherding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning \u2014
p166
aVI hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning,
p167
aVso why are we forcing our kids to do that?
p168
aVSo instead what you do
p169
aVis you have them watch videos
p170
aVand do interactive exercises
p171
aVin the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom,
p172
aVin the dining room, in the bathroom,
p173
aVwherever they're most creative.
p174
aVThen they come into the classroom
p175
aVfor some in-person interaction.
p176
aVThey can have discussions amongst themselves.
p177
aVThey can solve problems together.
p178
aVThey can work with the professor
p179
aVand have the professor answer their questions.
p180
aVIn fact, with edX, when we were teaching our first course
p181
aVon circuits and electronics around the world,
p182
aVthis was happening unbeknownst to us.
p183
aVTwo high school teachers
p184
aVat the Sant High School in Mongolia
p185
aVhad flipped their classroom,
p186
aVand they were using our video lectures
p187
aVand interactive exercises,
p188
aVwhere the learners in the high school,
p189
aV15-year-olds, mind you,
p190
aVwould go and do these things in their own homes
p191
aVand they would come into class,
p192
aVand as you see from this image here,
p193
aVthey would interact with each other
p194
aVand do some physical laboratory work.
p195
aVAnd the only way we discovered this
p196
aVwas they wrote a blog
p197
aVand we happened to stumble upon that blog.
p198
aa(lp199
VWe were also doing other pilots.
p200
aVSo we did a pilot experimental blended courses,
p201
aVworking with San Jose State University in California,
p202
aVagain, with the circuits and electronics course.
p203
aVYou'll hear that a lot. That course has become
p204
aVsort of like our petri dish of learning.
p205
aVSo there, the students would, again,
p206
aVthe instructors flipped the classroom,
p207
aVblended online and in person,
p208
aVand the results were staggering.
p209
aVNow don't take these results to the bank just yet.
p210
aVJust wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more,
p211
aVbut the early results are incredible.
p212
aVSo traditionally, semester upon semester,
p213
aVfor the past several years, this course,
p214
aVagain, a hard course,
p215
aVhad a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent
p216
aVevery semester.
p217
aVWith this blended class late last year,
p218
aVthe failure rate fell to nine percent.
p219
aVSo the results can be extremely, extremely good.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow before we go too far into this,
p222
aVI'd like to spend some time discussing
p223
aVsome key ideas.
p224
aVWhat are some key ideas
p225
aVthat makes all of this work?
p226
aa(lp227
VOne idea is active learning.
p228
aVThe idea here is, rather than have students
p229
aVwalk into class and watch lectures,
p230
aVwe replace this with what we call lessons.
p231
aVLessons are interleaved sequences
p232
aVof videos and interactive exercises.
p233
aVSo a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video
p234
aVand follow that with an interactive exercise.
p235
aVThink of this as the ultimate Socratization of education.
p236
aVYou teach by asking questions.
p237
aVAnd this is a form of learning
p238
aVcalled active learning,
p239
aVand really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972,
p240
aVby Craik and Lockhart,
p241
aVwhere they said and discovered
p242
aVthat learning and retention really relates strongly
p243
aVto the depth of mental processing.
p244
aVStudents learn much better
p245
aVwhen they are interacting with the material.
p246
aa(lp247
VThe second idea is self-pacing.
p248
aVNow, when I went to a lecture hall,
p249
aVand if you were like me,
p250
aVby the fifth minute I would lose the professor.
p251
aVI wasn't all that smart, and I would be scrambling, taking notes,
p252
aVand then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour.
p253
aVInstead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies,
p254
aVwe offer videos and interactive engagements to students?
p255
aVThey can hit the pause button.
p256
aVThey can rewind the professor.
p257
aVHeck, they can even mute the professor.
p258
aVSo this form of self-pacing
p259
aVcan be very helpful to learning.
p260
aa(lp261
VThe third idea that we have is instant feedback.
p262
aVWith instant feedback,
p263
aVthe computer grades exercises.
p264
aVI mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students?
p265
aVYour computer is grading all the exercises.
p266
aVAnd we've all submitted homeworks,
p267
aVand your grades come back two weeks later,
p268
aVyou've forgotten all about it.
p269
aVI don't think I've still received some of my homeworks
p270
aVfrom my undergraduate days.
p271
aVSome are never graded.
p272
aVSo with instant feedback,
p273
aVstudents can try to apply answers.
p274
aVIf they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback.
p275
aVThey can try it again and try it again,
p276
aVand this really becomes much more engaging.
p277
aVThey get the instant feedback,
p278
aVand this little green check mark that you see here
p279
aVis becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX.
p280
aVLearners are telling us that they go to bed at night
p281
aVdreaming of the green check mark.
p282
aVIn fact, one of our learners
p283
aVwho took the circuits course early last year,
p284
aVhe then went on to take a software course
p285
aVfrom Berkeley at the end of the year,
p286
aVand this is what the learner had to say
p287
aVon our discussion board
p288
aVwhen he just started that course
p289
aVabout the green check mark:
p290
aV"Oh god; have I missed you."
p291
aVWhen's the last time you've seen students
p292
aVposting comments like this about homework?
p293
aVMy colleague Ed Bertschinger,
p294
aVwho heads up the physics department at MIT,
p295
aVhas this to say about instant feedback:
p296
aVHe indicated that instant feedback
p297
aVturns teaching moments into learning outcomes.
p298
aa(lp299
VThe next big idea is gamification.
p300
aVYou know, all learners engage really well
p301
aVwith interactive videos and so on.
p302
aVYou know, they would sit down and shoot
p303
aValien spaceships all day long until they get it.
p304
aVSo we applied these gamification techniques to learning,
p305
aVand we can build these online laboratories.
p306
aVHow do you teach creativity? How do you teach design?
p307
aVWe can do this through online labs
p308
aVand use computing power
p309
aVto build these online labs.
p310
aVSo as this little video shows here,
p311
aVyou can engage students
p312
aVmuch like they design with Legos.
p313
aVSo here, the learners are building a circuit
p314
aVwith Lego-like ease.
p315
aVAnd this can also be graded by the computer.
p316
aa(lp317
VFifth is peer learning.
p318
aVSo here, we use discussion forums and discussions
p319
aVand Facebook-like interaction
p320
aVnot as a distraction,
p321
aVbut to really help students learn.
p322
aVLet me tell you a story.
p323
aVWhen we did our circuits course
p324
aVfor the 155,000 students,
p325
aVI didn't sleep for three nights
p326
aVleading up to the launch of the course.
p327
aVI told my TAs, okay, 24/7,
p328
aVwe're going to be up
p329
aVmonitoring the forum, answering questions.
p330
aVThey had answered questions for 100 students.
p331
aVHow do you do that for 150,000?
p332
aVSo one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night,
p333
aVand I think there's this question
p334
aVfrom a student from Pakistan,
p335
aVand he asked a question, and I said,
p336
aVokay, let me go and type up an answer,
p337
aVI don't type all that fast,
p338
aVand I begin typing up the answer,
p339
aVand before I can finish,
p340
aVanother student from Egypt popped in with an answer,
p341
aVnot quite right, so I'm fixing the answer,
p342
aVand before I can finish, a student from the U.S.
p343
aVhad popped in with a different answer.
p344
aVAnd then I sat back, fascinated.
p345
aVBoom, boom, boom, boom, the students were
p346
aVdiscussing and interacting with each other,
p347
aVand by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated,
p348
aVhaving this epiphany,
p349
aVand by 4 a.m. in the morning,
p350
aVthey had discovered the right answer.
p351
aVAnd all I had to do was go and bless it,
p352
aV"Good answer."
p353
aVSo this is absolutely amazing,
p354
aVwhere students are learning from each other,
p355
aVand they're telling us that they are learning
p356
aVby teaching.
p357
aa(lp358
VNow this is all not just in the future.
p359
aVThis is happening today.
p360
aVSo we are applying these blended learning pilots
p361
aVin a number of universities and  high schools around the world,
p362
aVfrom Tsinghua in China
p363
aVto the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia
p364
aVto Berkeley in California \u2014
p365
aVall over the world.
p366
aVAnd these kinds of technologies really help,
p367
aVthe blended model can really help
p368
aVrevolutionize education.
p369
aVIt can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs,
p370
aVthe business aspect.
p371
aVWe can also license these MOOC courses
p372
aVto other universities,
p373
aVand therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs,
p374
aVwhere the university that licenses it with the professor
p375
aVcan use these online courses
p376
aVlike the next-generation textbook.
p377
aVThey can use as much or as little as they like,
p378
aVand it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal.
p379
aa(lp380
VFinally, I would like to have you
p381
aVdream with me for a little bit.
p382
aVI would like us to really reimagine education.
p383
aVWe will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces.
p384
aVWe have to move from books to tablets
p385
aVlike the Aakash in India
p386
aVor the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars.
p387
aVThe Aakash is 40 dollars.
p388
aVWe have to move from bricks-and-mortar school buildings
p389
aVto digital dormitories.
p390
aa(lp391
VBut I think at the end of the day,
p392
aVI think we will still need one lecture hall
p393
aVin our universities.
p394
aVOtherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren
p395
aVthat your grandparents sat in that room
p396
aVin neat little rows like cornstalks
p397
aVand watched this professor at the end
p398
aVtalk about content and, you know,
p399
aVyou didn't even have a rewind button?
p400
aa(lp401
VThank you.
p402
aa(lp403
V(Applause)
p404
aa(lp405
VThank you. Thank you. (Applause)

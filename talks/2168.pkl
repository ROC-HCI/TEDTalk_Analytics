VSo we humans have an extraordinary potential for goodness,
p5
aVbut also an immense power to do harm.
p6
aVAny tool can be used to build or to destroy.
p7
aVThat all depends on our motivation.
p8
aVTherefore, it is all the more important
p9
aVto foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo now we indeed are facing  many challenges in our times.
p12
aVThose could be personal challenges.
p13
aVOur own mind can be our best friend or our worst enemy.
p14
aVThere's also societal challenges:
p15
aVpoverty in the midst of plenty, inequalities, conflict, injustice.
p16
aVAnd then there are the new challenges, which we don't expect.
p17
aVTen thousand years ago, there were about five million human beings on Earth.
p18
aVWhatever they could do,
p19
aVthe Earth's resilience  would soon heal human activities.
p20
aVAfter the Industrial and Technological Revolutions,
p21
aVthat's not the same anymore.
p22
aVWe are now the major agent of impact on our Earth.
p23
aVWe enter the Anthropocene, the era of human beings.
p24
aVSo in a way, if we were to say we need to continue this endless growth,
p25
aVendless use of material resources,
p26
aVit's like if this man was saying \u2014
p27
aVand I heard a former head of state, I won't mention who, saying \u2014
p28
aV"Five years ago, we were at the edge of the precipice.
p29
aVToday we made a big step forward."
p30
aVSo this edge is the same that has been defined by scientists
p31
aVas the planetary boundaries.
p32
aVAnd within those boundaries, they can carry a number of factors.
p33
aVWe can still prosper, humanity can still prosper for 150,000 years
p34
aVif we keep the same stability of climate
p35
aVas in the Holocene for the last 10,000 years.
p36
aVBut this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity,
p37
aVgrowing qualitatively, not quantitatively.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo in 1900, as you can see, we were well within the limits of safety.
p40
aVNow, in 1950 came the great acceleration.
p41
aVNow hold your breath, not too long, to imagine what comes next.
p42
aVNow we have vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries.
p43
aVJust to take biodiversity,  at the current rate,
p44
aVby 2050, 30 percent of all species  on Earth will have disappeared.
p45
aVEven if we keep their DNA in some fridge, that's not going to be reversible.
p46
aVSo here I am sitting
p47
aVin front of a 7,000-meter-high,  21,000-foot glacier in Bhutan.
p48
aVAt the Third Pole, 2,000 glaciers are melting fast, faster than the Arctic.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo what can we do in that situation?
p51
aVWell, however complex politically, economically, scientifically
p52
aVthe question of the environment is,
p53
aVit simply boils down to a question of altruism versus selfishness.
p54
aVI'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVGroucho Marx said, "Why should I care about future generations?
p57
aVWhat have they ever done for me?"
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVUnfortunately, I heard the billionaire Steve Forbes,
p60
aVon Fox News, saying exactly  the same thing, but seriously.
p61
aVHe was told about the rise of the ocean,
p62
aVand he said, "I find it absurd to change my behavior today
p63
aVfor something that will happen  in a hundred years."
p64
aVSo if you don't care for future generations,
p65
aVjust go for it.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo one of the main challenges of our times
p68
aVis to reconcile three time scales:
p69
aVthe short term of the economy,
p70
aVthe ups and downs of the stock market, the end-of-the-year accounts;
p71
aVthe midterm of the quality of life \u2014
p72
aVwhat is the quality every moment of our  life, over 10 years and 20 years? \u2014
p73
aVand the long term of the environment.
p74
aVWhen the environmentalists speak with economists,
p75
aVit's like a schizophrenic dialogue, completely incoherent.
p76
aVThey don't speak the same language.
p77
aVNow, for the last 10 years, I went around the world
p78
aVmeeting economists, scientists, neuroscientists, environmentalists,
p79
aVphilosophers, thinkers  in the Himalayas, all over the place.
p80
aVIt seems to me, there's only one concept
p81
aVthat can reconcile those three time scales.
p82
aVIt is simply having more consideration for others.
p83
aVIf you have more consideration for others, you will have a caring economics,
p84
aVwhere finance is at the service of society
p85
aVand not society at the service of finance.
p86
aVYou will not play at the casino
p87
aVwith the resources that people have entrusted you with.
p88
aVIf you have more consideration for others,
p89
aVyou will make sure that you remedy inequality,
p90
aVthat you bring some kind  of well-being within society,
p91
aVin education, at the workplace.
p92
aVOtherwise, a nation that is the most powerful and the richest
p93
aVbut everyone is miserable, what's the point?
p94
aVAnd if you have more consideration for others,
p95
aVyou are not going to ransack that planet that we have
p96
aVand at the current rate, we don't have three planets to continue that way.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo the question is,
p99
aVokay, altruism is the answer, it's not just a novel ideal,
p100
aVbut can it be a real, pragmatic solution?
p101
aVAnd first of all, does it exist,
p102
aVtrue altruism, or are we so selfish?
p103
aVSo some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish.
p104
aVBut are we really all just like rascals?
p105
aVThat's good news, isn't it?
p106
aVMany philosophers,  like Hobbes, have said so.
p107
aVBut not everyone looks like a rascal.
p108
aVOr is man a wolf for man?
p109
aVBut this guy doesn't seem too bad.
p110
aVHe's one of my friends in Tibet.
p111
aVHe's very kind.
p112
aVSo now, we love cooperation.
p113
aVThere's no better joy  than working together, is there?
p114
aVAnd then not only humans.
p115
aVThen, of course, there's the struggle for life,
p116
aVthe survival of the fittest, social Darwinism.
p117
aVBut in evolution, cooperation \u2014 though competition exists, of course \u2014
p118
aVcooperation has to be much more creative to go to increased levels of complexity.
p119
aVWe are super-cooperators  and we should even go further.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo now, on top of that, the quality of human relationships.
p122
aVThe OECD did a survey among 10 factors, including income, everything.
p123
aVThe first one that people said, that's the main thing for my happiness,
p124
aVis quality of social relationships.
p125
aVNot only in humans.
p126
aVAnd look at those great-grandmothers.
p127
aVSo now, this idea  that if we go deep within,
p128
aVwe are irredeemably selfish,
p129
aVthis is armchair science.
p130
aVThere is not a single sociological study,
p131
aVpsychological study, that's ever shown that.
p132
aVRather, the opposite.
p133
aVMy friend, Daniel Batson,  spent a whole life
p134
aVputting people in the lab in very complex situations.
p135
aVAnd of course we are sometimes selfish, and some people more than others.
p136
aVBut he found that systematically, no matter what,
p137
aVthere's a significant number of people
p138
aVwho do behave altruistically, no matter what.
p139
aVIf you see someone deeply wounded, great suffering,
p140
aVyou might just help out of empathic distress \u2014
p141
aVyou can't stand it, so it's better to help than to keep on looking at that person.
p142
aVSo we tested all that, and in the end,  he said, clearly people can be altruistic.
p143
aVSo that's good news.
p144
aVAnd even further, we should look at the banality of goodness.
p145
aVNow look at here.
p146
aVWhen we come out, we aren't  going to say, "That's so nice.
p147
aVThere was no fistfight while this mob  was thinking about altruism."
p148
aVNo, that's expected, isn't it?
p149
aVIf there was a fistfight, we would speak of that for months.
p150
aVSo the banality of goodness is something that doesn't attract your attention,
p151
aVbut it exists.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, look at this.
p154
aVSo some psychologists said,
p155
aVwhen I tell them I run 140 humanitarian  projects in the Himalayas
p156
aVthat give me so much joy,
p157
aVthey said, "Oh, I see, you work for the warm glow.
p158
aVThat is not altruistic. You just feel good."
p159
aVYou think this guy, when he jumped in front of the train,
p160
aVhe thought, "I'm going to feel so good when this is over?"
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVBut that's not the end of it.
p163
aVThey say, well, but when you interviewed him, he said,
p164
aV"I had no choice. I had to jump, of course."
p165
aVHe has no choice. Automatic behavior. It's neither selfish nor altruistic.
p166
aVNo choice?
p167
aVWell of course, this guy's not going to think for half an hour,
p168
aV"Should I give my hand? Not give my hand?"
p169
aVHe does it. There is a choice, but it's obvious, it's immediate.
p170
aVAnd then, also, there he had a choice.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VThere are people who had choice, like Pastor André Trocmé and his wife,
p174
aVand the whole village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in France.
p175
aVFor the whole Second World War, they saved 3,500 Jews,
p176
aVgave them shelter, brought them to Switzerland,
p177
aVagainst all odds, at the risk of their lives and those of their family.
p178
aVSo altruism does exist.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo what is altruism?
p181
aVIt is the wish: May others be happy and find the cause of happiness.
p182
aVNow, empathy is the affective resonance or cognitive resonance that tells you,
p183
aVthis person is joyful, this person suffers.
p184
aVBut empathy alone is not sufficient.
p185
aVIf you keep on being confronted with suffering,
p186
aVyou might have empathic distress, burnout,
p187
aVso you need the greater sphere of loving-kindness.
p188
aVWith Tania Singer at the Max Planck  Institute of Leipzig,
p189
aVwe showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving-kindness are different.
p190
aVNow, that's all well done,
p191
aVso we got that from evolution, from maternal care, parental love,
p192
aVbut we need to extend that.
p193
aVIt can be extended even to other species.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, if we want a more altruistic society, we need two things:
p196
aVindividual change and societal change.
p197
aVSo is individual change possible?
p198
aVTwo thousand years of contemplative study said yes, it is.
p199
aVNow, 15 years of collaboration with neuroscience and epigenetics
p200
aVsaid yes, our brains change when you train in altruism.
p201
aVSo I spent 120 hours in an MRI machine.
p202
aVThis is the first time I went after two and a half hours.
p203
aVAnd then the result has been published in many scientific papers.
p204
aVIt shows without ambiguity that there is structural change
p205
aVand functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love.
p206
aVJust to give you an idea:
p207
aVthis is the meditator at rest on the left,
p208
aVmeditator in compassion meditation, you see all the activity,
p209
aVand then the control group at rest, nothing happened,
p210
aVin meditation, nothing happened.
p211
aVThey have not been trained.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo do you need 50,000 hours  of meditation? No, you don't.
p214
aVFour weeks, 20 minutes a day, of caring, mindfulness meditation
p215
aValready brings a structural change in the brain compared to a control group.
p216
aVThat's only 20 minutes a day for four weeks.
p217
aa(lp218
VEven with preschoolers \u2014 Richard Davidson did that in Madison.
p219
aVAn eight-week program: gratitude, loving- kindness, cooperation, mindful breathing.
p220
aVYou would say,  "Oh, they're just preschoolers."
p221
aVLook after eight weeks,
p222
aVthe pro-social behavior, that's the blue line.
p223
aVAnd then comes the ultimate scientific test, the stickers test.
p224
aVBefore, you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class,
p225
aVtheir least favorite child, an unknown child, and the sick child,
p226
aVand they have to give stickers away.
p227
aVSo before the intervention, they give most of it to their best friend.
p228
aVFour, five years old,  20 minutes three times a week.
p229
aVAfter the intervention, no more discrimination:
p230
aVthe same amount of stickers to their  best friend and the least favorite child.
p231
aVThat's something we should do in all the schools in the world.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow where do we go from there?
p234
aa(lp235
V(Applause)
p236
aa(lp237
VWhen the Dalai Lama heard that, he told Richard Davidson,
p238
aV"You go to 10 schools, 100 schools, the U.N., the whole world."
p239
aa(lp240
VSo now where do we go from there?
p241
aVIndividual change is possible.
p242
aVNow do we have to wait for an altruistic  gene to be in the human race?
p243
aVThat will take 50,000 years, too much for the environment.
p244
aVFortunately, there is the evolution of culture.
p245
aVCultures, as specialists have shown, change faster than genes.
p246
aVThat's the good news.
p247
aVLook, attitude towards war has dramatically changed over the years.
p248
aVSo now individual change and cultural  change mutually fashion each other,
p249
aVand yes, we can achieve a more altruistic society.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo where do we go from there?
p252
aVMyself, I will go back to the East.
p253
aVNow we treat 100,000 patients a year in our projects.
p254
aVWe have 25,000 kids in school, four percent overhead.
p255
aVSome people say, "Well, your stuff works in practice,
p256
aVbut does it work in theory?"
p257
aVThere's always positive deviance.
p258
aVSo I will also go back to my hermitage
p259
aVto find the inner resources to better serve others.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut on the more global level, what can we do?
p262
aVWe need three things.
p263
aVEnhancing cooperation:
p264
aVCooperative learning in the school instead of competitive learning,
p265
aVUnconditional cooperation within corporations \u2014
p266
aVthere can be some competition between corporations, but not within.
p267
aVWe need sustainable harmony. I love this term.
p268
aVNot sustainable growth anymore.
p269
aVSustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality.
p270
aVIn the future, we do more with less,
p271
aVand we continue to grow qualitatively, not quantitatively.
p272
aVWe need caring economics.
p273
aVThe Homo economicus cannot deal with poverty in the midst of plenty,
p274
aVcannot deal with the problem of the common goods
p275
aVof the atmosphere, of the oceans.
p276
aVWe need a caring economics.
p277
aVIf you say economics should be compassionate,
p278
aVthey say, "That's not our job."
p279
aVBut if you say they don't care, that looks bad.
p280
aVWe need local commitment, global responsibility.
p281
aVWe need to extend altruism to the other 1.6 million species.
p282
aVSentient beings  are co-citizens in this world.
p283
aVand we need to dare altruism.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo, long live the altruistic revolution.
p286
aVViva la revolución de altruismo.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VThank you.

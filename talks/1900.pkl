VThree and a half years ago,
p5
aVI made one of the best decisions of my life.
p6
aVAs my New Year's resolution,
p7
aVI gave up dieting, stopped worrying about my weight,
p8
aVand learned to eat mindfully.
p9
aVNow I eat whenever I'm hungry,
p10
aVand I've lost 10 pounds.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis was me at age 13,
p13
aVwhen I started my first diet.
p14
aVI look at that picture now, and I think,
p15
aVyou did not need a diet,
p16
aVyou needed a fashion consult.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVBut I thought I needed to lose weight,
p19
aVand when I gained it back,
p20
aVof course I blamed myself.
p21
aVAnd for the next three decades,
p22
aVI was on and off various diets.
p23
aVNo matter what I tried,
p24
aVthe weight I'd lost always came back.
p25
aVI'm sure many of you know the feeling.
p26
aa(lp27
VAs a neuroscientist,
p28
aVI wondered, why is this so hard?
p29
aVObviously, how much you weigh depends on
p30
aVhow much you eat and how much energy you burn.
p31
aVWhat most people don't realize
p32
aVis that hunger and energy use
p33
aVare controlled by the brain,
p34
aVmostly without your awareness.
p35
aVYour brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes,
p36
aVand that is a good thing,
p37
aVbecause your conscious mind \u2014
p38
aVhow do we put this politely? \u2014
p39
aVit's easily distracted.
p40
aVIt's good that you don't have to remember to breathe
p41
aVwhen you get caught up in a movie.
p42
aVYou don't forget how to walk
p43
aVbecause you're thinking about what to have for dinner.
p44
aa(lp45
VYour brain also has its own sense
p46
aVof what you should weigh,
p47
aVno matter what you consciously believe.
p48
aVThis is called your set point,
p49
aVbut that's a misleading term,
p50
aVbecause it's actually a range
p51
aVof about 10 or 15 pounds.
p52
aVYou can use lifestyle choices to move your weight
p53
aVup and down within that range,
p54
aVbut it's much, much harder to stay outside of it.
p55
aVThe hypothalamus, the part of the brain
p56
aVthat regulates body weight,
p57
aVthere are more than a dozen chemical signals
p58
aVin the brain that tell your body to gain weight,
p59
aVmore than another dozen that tell your body to lose it,
p60
aVand the system works like a thermostat,
p61
aVresponding to signals from the body
p62
aVby adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism,
p63
aVto keep your weight stable as conditions change.
p64
aVThat's what a thermostat does, right?
p65
aVIt keeps the temperature in your house the same
p66
aVas the weather changes outside.
p67
aVNow you can try to change the temperature
p68
aVin your house by opening a window in the winter,
p69
aVbut that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat,
p70
aVwhich will respond by kicking on the furnace
p71
aVto warm the place back up.
p72
aVYour brain works exactly the same way,
p73
aVresponding to weight loss by using powerful tools
p74
aVto push your body back
p75
aVto what it considers normal.
p76
aVIf you lose a lot of weight,
p77
aVyour brain reacts as if you were starving,
p78
aVand whether you started out fat or thin,
p79
aVyour brain's response is exactly the same.
p80
aVWe would love to think that your brain could tell
p81
aVwhether you need to lose weight or not,
p82
aVbut it can't.
p83
aVIf you do lose a lot of weight,
p84
aVyou become hungry,
p85
aVand your muscles burn less energy.
p86
aVDr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University
p87
aVhas found that people who have lost
p88
aV10 percent of their body weight
p89
aVburn 250 to 400 calories less
p90
aVbecause their metabolism is suppressed.
p91
aVThat's a lot of food.
p92
aVThis means that a successful dieter
p93
aVmust eat this much less forever
p94
aVthan someone of the same weight
p95
aVwho has always been thin.
p96
aa(lp97
VFrom an evolutionary perspective,
p98
aVyour body's resistance to weight loss makes sense.
p99
aVWhen food was scarce, our ancestors' survival
p100
aVdepended on conserving energy,
p101
aVand regaining the weight when food was available
p102
aVwould have protected them against the next shortage.
p103
aVOver the course of human history,
p104
aVstarvation has been a much bigger problem
p105
aVthan overeating.
p106
aVThis may explain a very sad fact:
p107
aVSet points can go up,
p108
aVbut they rarely go down.
p109
aVNow, if your mother ever mentioned
p110
aVthat life is not fair,
p111
aVthis is the kind of thing she was talking about.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVSuccessful dieting doesn't lower your set point.
p114
aVEven after you've kept the weight off
p115
aVfor as long as seven years,
p116
aVyour brain keeps trying to make you gain it back.
p117
aVIf that weight loss had been due to a long famine,
p118
aVthat would be a sensible response.
p119
aVIn our modern world of drive-thru burgers,
p120
aVit's not working out so well for many of us.
p121
aVThat difference between our ancestral past
p122
aVand our abundant present
p123
aVis the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff
p124
aVof the University of Ottawa
p125
aVwould like to take some of his patients back to a time
p126
aVwhen food was less available,
p127
aVand it's also the reason
p128
aVthat changing the food environment
p129
aVis really going to be the most effective solution
p130
aVto obesity.
p131
aa(lp132
VSadly, a temporary weight gain
p133
aVcan become permanent.
p134
aVIf you stay at a high weight for too long,
p135
aVprobably a matter of years for most of us,
p136
aVyour brain may decide that that's the new normal.
p137
aa(lp138
VPsychologists classify eaters into two groups,
p139
aVthose who rely on their hunger
p140
aVand those who try to control their eating
p141
aVthrough willpower, like most dieters.
p142
aVLet's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters.
p143
aVThe interesting thing is that intuitive eaters
p144
aVare less likely to be overweight,
p145
aVand they spend less time thinking about food.
p146
aVControlled eaters are more vulnerable
p147
aVto overeating in response to advertising,
p148
aVsuper-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet.
p149
aVAnd a small indulgence,
p150
aVlike eating one scoop of ice cream,
p151
aVis more likely to lead to a food binge
p152
aVin controlled eaters.
p153
aVChildren are especially vulnerable
p154
aVto this cycle of dieting and then binging.
p155
aVSeveral long-term studies have shown
p156
aVthat girls who diet in their early teenage years
p157
aVare three times more likely to become overweight
p158
aVfive years later,
p159
aVeven if they started at a normal weight,
p160
aVand all of these studies found
p161
aVthat the same factors
p162
aVthat predicted weight gain
p163
aValso predicted the development of eating disorders.
p164
aVThe other factor, by the way,
p165
aVthose of you who are parents,
p166
aVwas being teased by family members
p167
aVabout their weight.
p168
aVSo don't do that.
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VI left almost all my graphs at home,
p172
aVbut I couldn't resist throwing in just this one,
p173
aVbecause I'm a geek, and that's how I roll.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVThis is a study that looked at the risk of death
p176
aVover a 14-year period
p177
aVbased on four healthy habits:
p178
aVeating enough fruits and vegetables,
p179
aVexercise three times a week,
p180
aVnot smoking,
p181
aVand drinking in moderation.
p182
aVLet's start by looking at the normal weight
p183
aVpeople in the study.
p184
aVThe height of the bars is the risk of death,
p185
aVand those zero, one, two, three, four numbers
p186
aVon the horizontal axis
p187
aVare the number of those healthy habits
p188
aVthat a given person had.
p189
aVAnd as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle,
p190
aVthe less likely people were to die during the study.
p191
aVNow let's look at what happens
p192
aVin overweight people.
p193
aVThe ones that had no healthy habits
p194
aVhad a higher risk of death.
p195
aVAdding just one healthy habit
p196
aVpulls overweight people back into the normal range.
p197
aVFor obese people with no healthy habits,
p198
aVthe risk is very high, seven times higher
p199
aVthan the healthiest groups in the study.
p200
aVBut a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.
p201
aVIn fact, if you look only at the group
p202
aVwith all four healthy habits,
p203
aVyou can see that weight makes very little difference.
p204
aVYou can take control of your health
p205
aVby taking control of your lifestyle,
p206
aVeven If you can't lose weight
p207
aVand keep it off.
p208
aa(lp209
VDiets don't have very much reliability.
p210
aVFive years after a diet,
p211
aVmost people have regained the weight.
p212
aVForty percent of them have gained even more.
p213
aVIf you think about this,
p214
aVthe typical outcome of dieting
p215
aVis that you're more likely to gain weight
p216
aVin the long run than to lose it.
p217
aa(lp218
VIf I've convinced you that dieting
p219
aVmight be a problem,
p220
aVthe next question is, what do you do about it?
p221
aVAnd my answer, in a word, is mindfulness.
p222
aVI'm not saying you need to learn to meditate
p223
aVor take up yoga.
p224
aVI'm talking about mindful eating:
p225
aVlearning to understand your body's signals
p226
aVso that you eat when you're hungry
p227
aVand stop when you're full,
p228
aVbecause a lot of weight gain boils down
p229
aVto eating when you're not hungry.
p230
aVHow do you do it?
p231
aVGive yourself permission to eat
p232
aVas much as you want, and then work on figuring out
p233
aVwhat makes your body feel good.
p234
aVSit down to regular meals without distractions.
p235
aVThink about how your body feels
p236
aVwhen you start to eat and when you stop,
p237
aVand let your hunger decide
p238
aVwhen you should be done.
p239
aVIt took about a year for me to learn this,
p240
aVbut it's really been worth it.
p241
aVI am so much more relaxed around food
p242
aVthan I have ever been in my life.
p243
aVI often don't think about it.
p244
aVI forget we have chocolate in the house.
p245
aVIt's like aliens have taken over my brain.
p246
aVIt's just completely different.
p247
aVI should say that
p248
aVthis approach to eating probably won't make you lose weight
p249
aVunless you often eat when you're not hungry,
p250
aVbut doctors don't know of any approach
p251
aVthat makes significant weight loss in a lot of people,
p252
aVand that is why a lot of people are now focusing on
p253
aVpreventing weight gain
p254
aVinstead of promoting weight loss.
p255
aVLet's face it:
p256
aVIf diets worked, we'd all be thin already.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVWhy do we keep doing the same thing
p259
aVand expecting different results?
p260
aVDiets may seem harmless,
p261
aVbut they actually do a lot of collateral damage.
p262
aVAt worst, they ruin lives:
p263
aVWeight obsession leads to eating disorders,
p264
aVespecially in young kids.
p265
aVIn the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls
p266
aVsay they've been on a diet.
p267
aVOur daughters have learned to measure their worth
p268
aVby the wrong scale.
p269
aVEven at its best,
p270
aVdieting is a waste of time and energy.
p271
aVIt takes willpower which you could be using
p272
aVto help your kids with their homework
p273
aVor to finish that important work project,
p274
aVand because willpower is limited,
p275
aVany strategy that relies on its consistent application
p276
aVis pretty much guaranteed
p277
aVto eventually fail you
p278
aVwhen your attention moves on to something else.
p279
aa(lp280
VLet me leave you with one last thought.
p281
aVWhat if we told all those dieting girls
p282
aVthat it's okay to eat when they're hungry?
p283
aVWhat if we taught them to work with their appetite
p284
aVinstead of fearing it?
p285
aVI think most of them would be happier and healthier,
p286
aVand as adults,
p287
aVmany of them would probably be thinner.
p288
aVI wish someone had told me that
p289
aVback when I was 13.
p290
aa(lp291
VThanks.

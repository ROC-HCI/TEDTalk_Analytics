VAs a kid I always loved information
p5
aVthat I could get from data
p6
aVand the stories that could be told with numbers.
p7
aVI remember, growing up, I'd be frustrated at
p8
aVhow my own parents would lie to me using numbers.
p9
aV"Talithia, if I've told you once  I've told you a thousand times."
p10
aVNo dad, you've only told me 17 times
p11
aVand twice it wasn't my fault. (Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VI think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics.
p14
aVI always wanted to know,
p15
aVwhat are people trying to hide with numbers?
p16
aVAs a statistician,
p17
aVI want people to show me the data
p18
aVso I can decide for myself.
p19
aVDonald and I were pregnant with our third child
p20
aVand we were at about 41 and a half weeks,
p21
aVwhat some of you may refer to as being overdue.
p22
aVStatisticians, we call that
p23
aVbeing within the 95 percent confidence interval.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVAnd at this point in the process
p26
aVwe had to come in every couple of days
p27
aVto do a stress test on the baby,
p28
aVand this is just routine,
p29
aVit tests whether or not the baby  is feeling any type of undue stress.
p30
aVAnd you are rarely, if ever, seen by your actual doctor,
p31
aVjust whoever happens to be  working at the hospital that day.
p32
aVSo we go in for a stress test and after 20 minutes
p33
aVthe doctor comes out and he says,
p34
aV"Your baby is under stress, we need to induce you."
p35
aVNow, as a statistician, what's my response?
p36
aVShow me the data!
p37
aVSo then he proceeds to tell us
p38
aVthe baby's heart rate trace went from 18 minutes,
p39
aVthe baby's heart rate was in the normal zone
p40
aVand for two minutes it was in what appeared to be
p41
aVmy heart rate zone and I said,
p42
aV"Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate?
p43
aVI was moving around a little bit,
p44
aVit's hard to lay still on your back,
p45
aV41 weeks pregnant for 20 minutes.
p46
aVMaybe it was shifting around."
p47
aVHe said, "Well, we don't want to take any chances."
p48
aVI said okay.
p49
aVI said, "What if I was at 36 weeks
p50
aVwith this same data?
p51
aVWould your decision be to induce?"
p52
aV"Well, no, I would wait until you were at least
p53
aV38 weeks, but you are almost 42,
p54
aVthere is no reason to leave that baby inside,
p55
aVlet's get you a room."
p56
aVI said, "Well, why don't we just do it again?
p57
aVWe can collect more data.
p58
aVI can try to be really still for 20 minutes.
p59
aVWe can average the two and see
p60
aVwhat that means. (Laughter)
p61
aVAnd he goes,
p62
aV"Ma'am, I just don't want you to have a miscarriage."
p63
aVThat makes three of us.
p64
aVAnd then he says,
p65
aV"Your chances of having a miscarriage double
p66
aVwhen you go past your due date. Let's get you a room."
p67
aVWow. So now as a statistician, what's my response?
p68
aVShow me the data!
p69
aVDude, you're talking chances,
p70
aVI do chances all day long, tell me all about chances.
p71
aVLet's talk chances. (Laughter)
p72
aVLet's talk chances.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo I say, "Okay, great.
p75
aVDo I go from a 30-percent  chance to a 60-percent chance?
p76
aVWhere are we here with this miscarriage thing?
p77
aVAnd he goes, "Not quite, but it doubles,
p78
aVand we really just want what's best for the baby."
p79
aVUndaunted, I try a different angle.
p80
aVI said, "Okay, out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women,
p81
aVhow many of them are going to miscarry
p82
aVjust before their due date?
p83
aVAnd then he looks at me and looks at Donald,
p84
aVand he goes, about one in 1,000.
p85
aVI said, "Okay, so of those 1,000 women, how many
p86
aVare going to miscarry just after their due date?"
p87
aa(lp88
V"About two." (Laughter)
p89
aVI said, "Okay, so you are telling me that my chances
p90
aVgo from a 0.1-percent chance
p91
aVto a 0.2-percent chance."
p92
aa(lp93
VOkay, so at this point the data is not convincing us
p94
aVthat we need to be induced,
p95
aVand so then we proceed to have a conversation
p96
aVabout how inductions lead to a higher rate
p97
aVof Cesarean sections, and if at all  possible we'd like to avoid that.
p98
aVAnd then I said,
p99
aV"And I really don't think my due date is accurate."
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVAnd so this really stunned him
p102
aVand he looked sort of puzzled
p103
aVand I said, "You may not know this,
p104
aVbut pregnancy due dates are calculated
p105
aVassuming that you have a standard 28-day cycle,
p106
aVand my cycle ranges \u2014
p107
aVsometimes it's 27, sometimes it's up to 38 \u2014
p108
aVand I have been collecting the data to prove it.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aVAnd so we ended up leaving the hospital  that day without being induced.
p111
aVWe actually had to sign a waiver  to walk out of the hospital.
p112
aVAnd I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors,
p113
aVbecause even with our first child,
p114
aVwe were induced at 38 weeks; cervical fluid was low.
p115
aVI'm not anti-medical intervention.
p116
aVBut why were confident to leave that day?
p117
aVWell, we had data that told a different story.
p118
aVWe had been collecting data for six years.
p119
aVI had this temperature data,
p120
aVand it told a different story.
p121
aVIn fact, we could probably pretty  accurately estimate conception.
p122
aVYeah, that's a story you want to tell
p123
aVat your kid's wedding reception. (Laughter)
p124
aVI remember like it was yesterday.
p125
aVMy temperature was a sizzling 97.8 degrees
p126
aVas I stared into your father's eyes. (Laughter)
p127
aVOh, yeah. Twenty-two more years, we're telling that story.
p128
aVBut we were confident to leave  because we had been collecting data.
p129
aVNow, what does that data look like?
p130
aVHere's a standard chart
p131
aVof a woman's waking body temperature
p132
aVduring the course of a cycle.
p133
aVSo from the beginning of the menstrual cycle
p134
aVtill the beginning of the next.
p135
aVYou'll see that the temperature is not random.
p136
aVClearly there is a low pattern
p137
aVat the beginning of her cycle
p138
aVand then you see this jump and then a higher
p139
aVset of temperatures at the end of her cycle.
p140
aVSo what's happening here?
p141
aVWhat is that data telling you?
p142
aVWell, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle,
p143
aVthe hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen
p144
aVcauses a suppression of your body temperature.
p145
aVAnd at ovulation, your body releases an egg
p146
aVand progesterone takes over, pro-gestation.
p147
aVAnd so your body heats up in anticipation
p148
aVof housing this new little fertilized egg.
p149
aVSo why this temperature jump?
p150
aVWell, think about when a bird sits on her eggs.
p151
aVWhy is she sitting on them?
p152
aVShe wants to keep them warm,
p153
aVprotect them and keep them warm.
p154
aVLadies, this is exactly what our bodies do every month,
p155
aVthey heat up in anticipation
p156
aVof keeping a new little life warm.
p157
aVAnd if nothing happens, if you are not pregnant,
p158
aVthen estrogen takes back over and  that cycle starts all over again.
p159
aVBut if you do get pregnant, sometimes you
p160
aVactually see another shift in your temperatures
p161
aVand it stays elevated for those whole nine months.
p162
aVThat's why you see those pregnant  women just sweating and hot,
p163
aVbecause their temperatures are high.
p164
aVHere's a chart that we had about three or four years ago.
p165
aVWe were really very excited about this chart.
p166
aVYou'll see the low temperature level
p167
aVand then a shift and for about five days,
p168
aVthat's about the time it takes for the egg to travel
p169
aVdown the fallopian tube and implant,
p170
aVand then you see those temperatures  start to go up a little bit.
p171
aVAnd in fact, we had a second temperature shift,
p172
aVconfirmed with a pregnancy test  that were indeed pregnant
p173
aVwith our first child, very exciting.
p174
aVUntil a couple of days later
p175
aVI saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow,
p176
aVand we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage.
p177
aVHad I not been taking my temperature
p178
aVI really would have just thought  my period was late that month,
p179
aVbut we actually had data to show
p180
aVthat we had miscarried this baby,
p181
aVand even though this data revealed a really
p182
aVunfortunate event in our lives,
p183
aVit was information that we could then take to our doctor.
p184
aVSo if there was a fertility issue or some problem,
p185
aVI had data to show:
p186
aVLook, we got pregnant, our temperature shifted,
p187
aVwe somehow lost this baby.
p188
aVWhat is it that we can do to help prevent this problem?
p189
aVAnd it's not just about temperatures
p190
aVand it's not just about fertility;
p191
aVwe can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things.
p192
aa(lp193
VFor instance, did you know that taking  your temperature can tell you a lot
p194
aVabout the condition of your thyroid?
p195
aVSo, your thyroid works a lot like  the thermostat in your house.
p196
aVThere is an optimal temperature  that you want in your house;
p197
aVyou set your thermostat.
p198
aVWhen it gets too cold in the house, your thermostat kicks in
p199
aVand says, "Hey, we need to blow some heat around."
p200
aVOr if it gets too hot, your thermostat
p201
aVregisters, "Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off."
p202
aVThat's exactly how your thyroid works in your body.
p203
aVYour thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature
p204
aVfor your body.
p205
aVIf it gets too cold, your thyroid  says, "Hey, we need to heat up."
p206
aVIf it gets too hot, your thyroid cools you down.
p207
aVBut what happens when your  thyroid is not functioning well?
p208
aVWhen it doesn't function, then it shows up
p209
aVin your body temperatures,
p210
aVthey tend to be lower than normal or very erratic.
p211
aVAnd so by collecting this data
p212
aVyou can find out information about your thyroid.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, what is it, if you had a thyroid  problem and you went to the doctor,
p215
aVyour doctor would actually test the amount of
p216
aVthyroid stimulating hormone in your blood.
p217
aVFine. But the problem with that test is
p218
aVit doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body.
p219
aVSo you might have a lot of hormone present,
p220
aVbut it might not be actively working to regulate
p221
aVyour body temperature.
p222
aVSo just by collecting your temperature every day,
p223
aVyou get information about the condition of your thyroid.
p224
aVSo, what if you don't want to take  your temperature every day?
p225
aVI advocate that you do,
p226
aVbut there are tons of other things you could take.
p227
aVYou could take your blood pressure,  you could take your weight \u2014
p228
aVyeah, who's excited about
p229
aVtaking their weight every day? (Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VEarly on in our marriage, Donald had a stuffy nose
p232
aVand he had been taking a slew of medications
p233
aVto try to relieve his stuffy nose, to no avail.
p234
aVAnd so, that night he comes and  he wakes me up and he says,
p235
aV"Honey, I can't breath out of my nose."
p236
aVAnd I roll over and I look, and I said,  "Well, can you breath out of your mouth?"
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVAnd he goes, "Yes, but I can't breath out of my nose!"
p239
aVAnd so like any good wife, I rush him
p240
aVto the emergency room
p241
aVat 2 o'clock in the morning.
p242
aVAnd the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking,
p243
aVyou can't die on me now.
p244
aVWe just got married,
p245
aVpeople will think I killed you! (Laughter)
p246
aVAnd so, we get to the emergency  room, and the nurse sees us,
p247
aVand he can't breath out of his nose, and so
p248
aVshe brings us to the back and the doctor says,
p249
aV"What seems to be the problem?" and  he goes, "I can't breath out of my nose."
p250
aVAnd he said, "You can't breath out of your nose?
p251
aVNo, but he can breath out of his mouth. (Laughter)
p252
aVHe takes a step back and he looks at both of us
p253
aVand he says "Sir, I think I know the problem.
p254
aVYou're having a heart attack.
p255
aVI'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan
p256
aVfor you immediately."
p257
aVAnd we are thinking,
p258
aVno, no, no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe,
p259
aVjust out of his mouth. No, no, no, no, no.
p260
aVAnd so we go back and forth with this doctor
p261
aVbecause we think this is the incorrect diagnosis,
p262
aVand he's like, "No really, it'll be fine, just calm down."
p263
aVAnd I'm thinking, how do you calm down?  But I don't think he's having a heart attack.
p264
aVAnd so fortunately for us, this  doctor was at the end of the shift.
p265
aVSo this new doctor comes in, he sees us clearly
p266
aVdistraught, with a husband who can't breath
p267
aVout of his nose. (Laughter)
p268
aVAnd he starts asking us questions.
p269
aVHe says, "Well, do you two exercise?"
p270
aVWe ride our bikes, we go to the gym occasionally.
p271
aV(Laughter)
p272
aVWe move around.
p273
aVAnd he says, "What were you doing  just before you came here?"
p274
aVI'm thinking, I was sleeping, honestly.
p275
aVBut okay, what was Donald doing just before?
p276
aVSo Donald goes into this slew  of medications he was taking.
p277
aVHe lists, "I took this decongestant  and then I took this nasal spray,"
p278
aVand then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says,
p279
aV"Oh! You should never mix this  decongestant with this nasal spray.
p280
aVClogs you up every time. Here, take this one instead."
p281
aVHe gives us a prescription.
p282
aVWe're looking at each other, and I looked at the doctor,
p283
aVand I said, "Why is it that it seems like you
p284
aVwere able to accurately diagnose his condition,
p285
aVbut this previous doctor wanted to order
p286
aVan EKG and a CAT scan?"
p287
aVAnd he looks at us and says,
p288
aV"Well, when a 350-pound man walks in the  emergency room and says he can't breath,
p289
aVyou assume he's having a heart attack
p290
aVand you ask questions later."
p291
aVNow, emergency room doctors are  trained to make decisions quickly,
p292
aVbut not always accurately.
p293
aVAnd so had we had some information
p294
aVabout our heart health to share with him,
p295
aVmaybe we would have gotten a  better diagnosis the first time.
p296
aa(lp297
VI want you to consider the following chart,
p298
aVof systolic blood pressure measurements
p299
aVfrom October 2010 to July 2012.
p300
aVYou'll see that these measurements start
p301
aVin the prehypertension/hypertension zone,
p302
aVbut over about the course of a year and a half
p303
aVthey move into the normal zone.
p304
aVThis is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old.
p305
aVWhat story is this data telling you?
p306
aVObviously it's the data from someone
p307
aVwho's made a drastic transformation,
p308
aVand fortunately for us, that person  happens to be here today.
p309
aVSo that 350-pound guy that walked  into the emergency room with me
p310
aVis now an even sexier and healthier
p311
aV225-pound guy, and that's his blood pressure trace.
p312
aVSo over the course of that year and a half
p313
aVDonald's eating changed
p314
aVand our exercise regimen changed,
p315
aVand his heart rate responded,
p316
aVhis blood pressure responded to that change
p317
aVthat he made in his body.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo what's the take-home message
p320
aVthat I want you to leave with today?
p321
aVBy taking ownership of your data just like we've done,
p322
aVjust by taking this daily measurements about yourself,
p323
aVyou become the expert on your body.
p324
aVYou become the authority.
p325
aVIt's not hard to do.
p326
aVYou don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics
p327
aVto be an expert in yourself.
p328
aVYou don't have to have a medical degree
p329
aVto be your body's expert.
p330
aVMedical doctors, they're experts on the population,
p331
aVbut you are the expert on yourself.
p332
aVAnd so when two of you come together,
p333
aVwhen two experts come together,
p334
aVthe two of you are able to make a better decision
p335
aVthan just your doctor alone.
p336
aVNow that you understand the power of information
p337
aVthat you can get through personal data collection,
p338
aVI'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand.
p339
aV(Laughter)
p340
aVYes, get it up.
p341
aVI challenge you to take ownership of your data.
p342
aVAnd today, I hereby confer upon you
p343
aVa TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics
p344
aVwith a concentration in time-dependent data analysis
p345
aVwith all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto.
p346
aVAnd so the next time you are in your doctor's office,
p347
aVas newly inducted statisticians,
p348
aVwhat should always be your response?
p349
aVAudience: Show me the data!  Talithia Williams: I can't hear you!
p350
aVAudience: Show me the data!
p351
aVTW: One more time!
p352
aVAudience: Show me the data!
p353
aVTW: Show me the data.
p354
aVThank you.

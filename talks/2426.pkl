VHello.
p5
aVMy name is Matthew Williams,
p6
aVand I am a champion.
p7
aVI have won medals in three different sports
p8
aVand national games in Canada,
p9
aVcompeted at the international level in basketball
p10
aVand was proud to represent Canada
p11
aVon the world stage.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Applause)
p14
aa(lp15
VI train five days a week for basketball and speed skating,
p16
aVwork with top quality coaches
p17
aVand mental performance consultants
p18
aVto be at my best in my sport.
p19
aVBy the way, all that is through Special Olympics.
p20
aVDoes that change the way you think of me
p21
aVand my accomplishments?
p22
aa(lp23
VThe world does not see all people like me as champions.
p24
aVNot long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away.
p25
aVThere has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in 1968,
p26
aVbut in too many cases,
p27
aVpeople with intellectual disabilities
p28
aVare invisible to the wider population.
p29
aVPeople use the r-word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
p30
aVThat's the word "retard" or "retarded"
p31
aVused in a derogatory manner.
p32
aVThey're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends.
p33
aa(lp34
VI don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case.
p35
aVI am here because there is still a big problem with the way
p36
aVmany people see individuals with intellectual disabilities,
p37
aVor, too often,
p38
aVhow they don't see them at all.
p39
aa(lp40
VDid you know the World Games happened this year?
p41
aVI was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities
p42
aVfrom 165 countries who competed in LA.
p43
aVThere was over 62,000 spectators watching opening ceremonies,
p44
aVand there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN.
p45
aVDid you even know that happened?
p46
aa(lp47
VWhat do you think of when you see someone like me?
p48
aVI am here today to challenge you
p49
aVto look at us as equals.
p50
aa(lp51
VSpecial Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes
p52
aVwith intellectual disabilities
p53
aVand the perceptions of everyone watching.
p54
aVFor those of you who aren't familiar,
p55
aVSpecial Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
p56
aVSpecial Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics.
p57
aVWe offer high-quality, year round sports programs
p58
aVfor people with intellectual disabilities
p59
aVthat changes lives and perceptions.
p60
aVThis movement has changed my life
p61
aVand those of so many others.
p62
aVAnd it has changed the way
p63
aVthe world sees people with intellectual disabilities.
p64
aa(lp65
VI was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
p66
aVGrowing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.
p67
aVThe older I got, the more I felt
p68
aVit was harder to keep up with everyone else,
p69
aVand I was angry and frustrated.
p70
aVFor a while, I did not play any sports,
p71
aVdidn't have many friends
p72
aVand felt left out and sad.
p73
aa(lp74
VThere was a time when people with intellectual disabilities
p75
aVwere hidden away from society.
p76
aVNo one thought they could participate in sports,
p77
aVlet alone be a valued member of society.
p78
aVIn the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden,
p79
aVa scientist at the University of Toronto,
p80
aVwas studying the effects of regular exercise
p81
aVon the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities.
p82
aVUsing rigorous scientific research,
p83
aVDr. Hayden and other researchers
p84
aVcame to the conclusion
p85
aVthat it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate
p86
aVthat caused their fitness levels to suffer.
p87
aa(lp88
VLots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities
p89
aVcould benefit from fitness programs
p90
aVand sports competition opportunities.
p91
aVBut pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver,
p92
aVthe founder of Special Olympics,
p93
aVpersevered,
p94
aVand Special Olympics athletes have proved them right
p95
aVfour and a half million times over.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Applause)
p98
aa(lp99
VBefore I joined Special Olympics,
p100
aVI was nervous
p101
aVbecause I was young, shy, not confident
p102
aVand didn't have many friends.
p103
aVWhen I got there, though, everyone was very encouraging,
p104
aVsupportive, and let me be myself
p105
aVwithout being judged.
p106
aVNow, I am a basketball player and speed skater
p107
aVwho has competed at provincial, national games,
p108
aVand this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA,
p109
aVwhere I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team
p110
aVto compete at World Games.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Applause)
p113
aa(lp114
VI am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe,
p115
aVand I've heard so many similar stories.
p116
aVBeing Special Olympics athletes
p117
aVrestores our pride and dignity.
p118
aa(lp119
VSpecial Olympics also addresses critical health needs.
p120
aVStudies have shown that, on average,
p121
aVmen with intellectual disabilities
p122
aVdie 13 years younger than men without,
p123
aVand women with intellectual disabilities
p124
aVdie 20 years younger than women without.
p125
aVSpecial Olympics keeps us healthy
p126
aVby getting us active
p127
aVand participating in sport.
p128
aVAlso, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
p129
aVSpecial Olympics also provides free health screening
p130
aVfor athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor
p131
aVor accessing health care.
p132
aa(lp133
VAt the 2015 World Summer Games,
p134
aVmy Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team.
p135
aVThe day before our game,
p136
aVthe Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening,
p137
aVwhere seven of 10 members
p138
aVwere given hearing aids for free
p139
aVand got to hear clearly for the first time.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Applause)
p142
aa(lp143
VThe change in them was amazing.
p144
aVThey were more excited, happy and confident,
p145
aVbecause their coach could vocally communicate with them.
p146
aVAnd they were emotional
p147
aVbecause they could hear the sounds of the basketball,
p148
aVthe sounds of the whistle
p149
aVand the cheering fans in the stands \u2014
p150
aVsounds that we take for granted.
p151
aVSpecial Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport.
p152
aVSpecial Olympics is transforming their lives off the field.
p153
aVThis year, research findings showed
p154
aVthat nearly half of the adults in the US
p155
aVdon't know a single person with an intellectual disability,
p156
aVand the 44 percent of Americans
p157
aVwho don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities
p158
aVare significantly less accepting and positive.
p159
aa(lp160
VThen there's the r-word,
p161
aVproving that people with intellectual disabilities
p162
aVare still invisible
p163
aVto far too many people.
p164
aVPeople use it as a casual term or an insult.
p165
aVIt was tweeted more than nine million times last year,
p166
aVand it is deeply hurtful
p167
aVto me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet.
p168
aVPeople don't think it's insulting,
p169
aVbut it is.
p170
aVAs my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote
p171
aVin an open letter to a political pundit
p172
aVwho used the r-word as an insult,
p173
aV"Come join us someday at Special Olympics.
p174
aVSee if you walk away with your heart unchanged."
p175
aa(lp176
V(Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VThis year, at the 2015 World Summer Games,
p179
aVpeople lined up for hours
p180
aVto get into the final night of powerlifting competition.
p181
aVSo it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett,
p182
aVthe Newfoundland Moose,
p183
aVdeadlifted 655 pounds
p184
aVand lifted 611 pounds in the squat \u2014
p185
aa(lp186
V(Applause)
p187
aa(lp188
Vsetting huge new records for Special Olympics.
p189
aVJackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland \u2014
p190
aVnot just Special Olympics, all powerlifters.
p191
aVJackie was a huge star in LA,
p192
aVand ESPN live-tweeted his record-breaking lifts
p193
aVand were wowed by his performance.
p194
aa(lp195
VFifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities
p196
aVcould do anything like that.
p197
aVThis year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum
p198
aVto watch the opening ceremonies of World Games
p199
aVand cheer athletes from 165 countries
p200
aVaround the world.
p201
aVFar from being hidden away,
p202
aVwe were cheered and celebrated.
p203
aVSpecial Olympics teaches athletes
p204
aVto be confident and proud of themselves.
p205
aVSpecial Olympics teaches the world
p206
aVthat people with intellectual disabilities
p207
aVdeserve respect and inclusion.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VNow, I have dreams and achievements in my sport,
p212
aVgreat coaches,
p213
aVrespect and dignity,
p214
aVbetter health,
p215
aVand I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VI am no longer hidden, bullied
p220
aVand I am here doing a TED Talk.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VThe world is a different place because of Special Olympics,
p225
aVbut there is still farther to go.
p226
aVSo the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability,
p227
aVI hope you will see their ability.
p228
aVThe next time someone uses the r-word near you,
p229
aVI hope you will tell them how much it hurts.
p230
aVI hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
VI would like to leave you with one final thought.
p235
aVNelson Mandela said,
p236
aV"Sports has the power to change the world."
p237
aVSpecial Olympics is changing the world
p238
aVby transforming four and a half million athletes
p239
aVand giving us a place to be confident,
p240
aVmeet friends,
p241
aVnot be judged
p242
aVand get to feel like and be champions.
p243
aa(lp244
VThank you very much.

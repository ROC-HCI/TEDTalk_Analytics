VToday I'm going to take you on a voyage
p5
aVto some place so deep,
p6
aVso dark, so unexplored
p7
aVthat we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.
p8
aVIt's a place of myth and legend.
p9
aVIt's a place marked on ancient maps
p10
aVas "here be monsters."
p11
aVIt is a place where each new voyage of exploration
p12
aVbrings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange
p13
aVthat our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.
p14
aVInstead, they just make me green with envy
p15
aVthat my colleague from IUCN
p16
aVwas able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts
p17
aVto actually take photographs
p18
aVand to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.
p19
aa(lp20
VWe are talking about the high seas.
p21
aVThe "high seas" is a legal term,
p22
aVbut in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.
p23
aVWith an average depth of the oceans
p24
aVof 4,000 meters,
p25
aVin fact, the high seas covers and provides
p26
aVnearly 90 percent of the habitat
p27
aVfor life on this Earth.
p28
aVIt is, in theory, the global commons,
p29
aVbelonging to us all.
p30
aVBut in reality,
p31
aVit is managed by and for
p32
aVthose who have the resources
p33
aVto go out and exploit it.
p34
aVSo today I'm going to take you on a voyage
p35
aVto cast light on some of the outdated myths
p36
aVand legends and assumptions
p37
aVthat have kept us as the true stakeholders
p38
aVin the high seas in the dark.
p39
aVWe're going to voyage to some of these special places
p40
aVthat we've been discovering in the past few years
p41
aVto show why we really need to care.
p42
aVAnd then finally, we're going to try
p43
aVto develop and pioneer a new perspective
p44
aVon high seas governance
p45
aVthat's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation,
p46
aVbut framed in an arena of global norms
p47
aVof precaution and respect.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo here is a picture of the high seas
p50
aVas seen from above \u2014
p51
aVthat area in the darker blue.
p52
aVTo me, as an international lawyer,
p53
aVthis scared me far more
p54
aVthan any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen,
p55
aVfor it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean,
p56
aVthe global ocean,
p57
aVthat provides us all with carbon storage,
p58
aVwith heat storage, with oxygen,
p59
aVif you can only protect 36 percent.
p60
aVThis is indeed the true heart of the planet.
p61
aVSome of the problems that we have to confront
p62
aVare that the current international laws \u2014
p63
aVfor example, shipping \u2014
p64
aVprovide more protection
p65
aVto the areas closest to shore.
p66
aVFor example, garbage discharge,
p67
aVsomething you would think just simply goes away,
p68
aVbut the laws regulating
p69
aVship discharge of garbage
p70
aVactually get weaker the further you are from shore.
p71
aVAs a result, we have garbage patches
p72
aVthe size of twice-Texas.
p73
aVIt's unbelievable.
p74
aVWe used to think the solution to pollution
p75
aVwas dilution,
p76
aVbut that has proved to be no longer the case.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo what we have learned from social scientists
p79
aVand economists like Elinor Ostrom,
p80
aVwho are studying the phenomenon
p81
aVof management of the commons on a local scale,
p82
aVis that there are certain prerequisites
p83
aVthat you can put into place
p84
aVthat enable you to manage
p85
aVand access open space
p86
aVfor the good of one and all.
p87
aVAnd these include a sense of shared responsibility,
p88
aVcommon norms that bind people together as a community.
p89
aVConditional access: You can invite people in,
p90
aVbut they have to be able to play by the rules.
p91
aVAnd of course, if you want people to play by the rules,
p92
aVyou still need an effective system
p93
aVof monitoring and enforcement,
p94
aVfor as we've discovered,
p95
aVyou can trust, but you also need to verify.
p96
aa(lp97
VWhat I'd also like to convey
p98
aVis that it is not all doom and gloom
p99
aVthat we are seeing in the high seas.
p100
aVFor a group of very dedicated individuals \u2014
p101
aVscientists, conservationists,
p102
aVphotographers and states \u2014
p103
aVwere able to actually change a tragic trajectory
p104
aVthat was destroying fragile seascapes
p105
aVsuch as this coral garden
p106
aVthat you see in front of you.
p107
aVThat is, we're able to save it from a fate
p108
aVof deep-sea bottom trawling.
p109
aVAnd how did we do that?
p110
aVWell, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships
p111
aVand actually photographed the activities in process.
p112
aVBut we also spent many hours
p113
aVin the basements of the United Nations,
p114
aVtrying to work with governments to make them understand
p115
aVwhat was going on so far away from land
p116
aVthat few of us had ever even imagined
p117
aVthat these creatures existed.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo within three years,
p120
aVfrom 2003 to 2006,
p121
aVwe were able to get norm in place
p122
aVthat actually changed the paradigm
p123
aVof how fishers went about
p124
aVdeep-sea bottom trawling.
p125
aVInstead of "go anywhere, do anything you want,"
p126
aVwe actually created a regime
p127
aVthat required prior assessment of where you're going
p128
aVand a duty to prevent significant harm.
p129
aVIn 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress,
p130
aVthey discovered
p131
aVthat almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed
p132
aVhad been protected.
p133
aVThis does not mean that it's the final solution,
p134
aVor that this even provides permanent protection.
p135
aVBut what it does mean
p136
aVis that a group of individuals can form a community
p137
aVto actually shape
p138
aVthe way high seas are governed,
p139
aVto create a new regime.
p140
aVSo I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities
p141
aVfor creating a true, blue perspective
p142
aVfor this beautiful planet.
p143
aVSylvia's wish
p144
aVprovides us with that leverage, that access
p145
aVto the heart of human beings,
p146
aVyou might say,
p147
aVwho have rarely seen places beyond their own toes,
p148
aVbut are now hopefully going to become interested
p149
aVin the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles,
p150
aVwho indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.
p151
aa(lp152
VToday, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling
p153
aVof some of these special areas,
p154
aVjust to give you an idea of the flavor
p155
aVof the riches and wonders they do contain.
p156
aVThe Sargasso Sea, for example,
p157
aVis not a sea bounded by coastlines,
p158
aVbut it is bounded by oceanic currents
p159
aVthat contain and envelope
p160
aVthis wealth of sargassum
p161
aVthat grows and aggregates there.
p162
aVIt's also known as the spawning ground for eels
p163
aVfrom Northern European
p164
aVand Northern American rivers
p165
aVthat are now so dwindling in numbers
p166
aVthat they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm,
p167
aVand five showed up in the U.K. just recently.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut the Sargasso Sea,
p170
aVthe same way it aggregates sargassum weed,
p171
aVactually is pulling in the plastic
p172
aVfrom throughout the region.
p173
aVThis picture doesn't exactly show
p174
aVthe plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.
p175
aVBut there has just been a study
p176
aVthat was released in February
p177
aVthat showed there are 200,000
p178
aVpieces of plastic per square-kilometer
p179
aVnow floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea,
p180
aVand that is affecting the habitat
p181
aVfor the many species in their juvenile stages
p182
aVwho come to the Sargasso Sea
p183
aVfor its protection and its food.
p184
aVThe Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place
p185
aVfor the aggregation of these unique species
p186
aVthat have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.
p187
aVIt also provides a special habitat
p188
aVfor these flying fish to lay their eggs.
p189
aVBut what I'd like to get from this picture
p190
aVis that we truly do have an opportunity
p191
aVto launch a global initiative for protection.
p192
aVThus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need
p193
aVand its responsibility
p194
aVas having some of the Sargasso Sea
p195
aVwithin its national jurisdiction \u2014
p196
aVbut the vast majority is beyond \u2014
p197
aVto help spearhead a movement
p198
aVto achieve protection for this vital area.
p199
aa(lp200
VSpinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now:
p201
aVthe Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.
p202
aVIt's actually a bay.
p203
aVIt's considered high seas, because the continent
p204
aVhas been put off limits
p205
aVto territorial claims.
p206
aVSo anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.
p207
aVBut what makes the Ross Sea important
p208
aVis the vast sea of pack ice
p209
aVthat in the spring and summer
p210
aVprovides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill
p211
aVthat supports what, till recently,
p212
aVhas been a virtually intact
p213
aVnear-shore ecosystem.
p214
aVBut unfortunately, CCAMLR,
p215
aVthe regional commission
p216
aVin charge of conserving and managing fish stocks
p217
aVand other living marine resources,
p218
aVis unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests
p219
aVand has authorized the expansion
p220
aVof toothfish fisheries in the region.
p221
aVThe captain of a New Zealand vessel
p222
aVwho was just down there
p223
aVis reporting a significant decline
p224
aVin the number of the Ross Sea killer whales,
p225
aVwho are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish
p226
aVas their main source of food.
p227
aVSo what we need to do is to stand up boldly,
p228
aVsingly and together,
p229
aVto push governments,
p230
aVto push regional fisheries management organizations,
p231
aVto declare our right
p232
aVto declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing,
p233
aVso that the freedom to fish no longer means
p234
aVthe freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.
p235
aa(lp236
VComing closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome
p237
aVis a recently discovered area \u2014
p238
aVpotentially year-round habitat for blue whales.
p239
aVThere's enough food there to last them
p240
aVthe summer and the winter long.
p241
aVBut what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome
p242
aVis, in fact, it's not a permanent place.
p243
aVIt's an oceanographic phenomenon
p244
aVthat shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.
p245
aVSo, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.
p246
aVIt's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones
p247
aVof these five Central American countries,
p248
aVbut it moves with the season.
p249
aVAs such, it does create a challenge to protect,
p250
aVbut we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
p251
aVWe can use the same technologies that fishers use
p252
aVto identify where the species are,
p253
aVin order to close the area
p254
aVwhen it's most vulnerable,
p255
aVwhich may, in some cases, be year-round.
p256
aa(lp257
VGetting closer to shore, where we are,
p258
aVthis was in fact taken in the Galapagos.
p259
aVMany species are headed through this region,
p260
aVwhich is why there's been so much attention
p261
aVput into conservation
p262
aVof the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
p263
aVThis is the initiative that's been coordinated
p264
aVby Conservation International
p265
aVwith a variety of partners and governments
p266
aVto actually try to bring integrated management regime
p267
aVthroughout the area.
p268
aVThat is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go
p269
aVwith a real regional initiative.
p270
aVIt's protecting five World Heritage sites.
p271
aVUnfortunately, the World Heritage Convention
p272
aVdoes not recognize the need to protect areas
p273
aVbeyond national jurisdiction, at present.
p274
aVSo a place like the Costa Rica Dome
p275
aVcould not technically qualify
p276
aVthe time it's in the high seas.
p277
aVSo what we've been suggesting
p278
aVis that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention,
p279
aVso that it can adopt
p280
aVand urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites,
p281
aVor we need to change the name
p282
aVand call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.
p283
aVBut what we also know is that species like these sea turtles
p284
aVdo not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
p285
aVThese happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre,
p286
aVwhere they spend most of their time
p287
aVand often end up getting hooked like this,
p288
aVor as bycatch.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.
p291
aVWe need to work locally,
p292
aVbut we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.
p293
aVWe have the tools and technologies now
p294
aVto enable us to take a broader
p295
aVocean-basin-wide initiative.
p296
aVWe've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project,
p297
aVone of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.
p298
aVIt's provided us data like this,
p299
aVof tiny, little sooty shearwaters
p300
aVthat make the entire ocean basin their home.
p301
aVThey fly 65,000 kilometers
p302
aVin less than a year.
p303
aVSo we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.
p304
aVAnd its culminating year
p305
aVthat's going to be launched in October.
p306
aVSo stay tuned for further information.
p307
aVWhat I find so exciting
p308
aVis that the Census of Marine Life
p309
aVhas looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators;
p310
aVit's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column,
p311
aVwhere creatures like this flying sea cucumber
p312
aVhave been found.
p313
aVAnd fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN,
p314
aVto team up with the Census of Marine Life
p315
aVand many of the scientists working there
p316
aVto actually try to translate
p317
aVmuch of this information to policymakers.
p318
aVWe have the support of governments now behind us.
p319
aVWe've been revealing this information through technical workshops.
p320
aVAnd the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information
p321
aVto move ahead to protect some of these
p322
aVsignificant hope spots, hotspots.
p323
aVAt the same time we're saying,
p324
aV"Yes, we need more. We need to move forward."
p325
aa(lp326
VBut many of you have said,
p327
aVif you get these marine protected areas,
p328
aVor a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place,
p329
aVhow are you going to enforce it?
p330
aVWhich leads me to my second passion besides ocean science,
p331
aVwhich is outer space technology.
p332
aVI wanted to be an astronaut,
p333
aVso I've constantly followed
p334
aVwhat are the tools available to monitor Earth
p335
aVfrom outer space \u2014
p336
aVand that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about,
p337
aVin terms of being able to follow tagged species
p338
aVthroughout their life-cycles
p339
aVin the open ocean.
p340
aVWe can also tag and track fishing vessels.
p341
aVMany already have transponders on board
p342
aVthat allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.
p343
aVBut not all the vessels have those to date.
p344
aVIt does not take too much rocket science
p345
aVto actually try to create new laws to mandate,
p346
aVif you're going to have the privilege
p347
aVof accessing our high seas resources,
p348
aVwe need to know \u2014 someone needs to know \u2014
p349
aVwhere you are and what you're doing.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo it brings me to my main take-home message,
p352
aVwhich is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.
p353
aVWe can stop the collision course
p354
aVof 50 percent of the planet
p355
aVwith the high seas.
p356
aVBut we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.
p357
aVWe need to change how we actually go about
p358
aVmanaging these resources.
p359
aVWe need to get the new paradigm
p360
aVof precaution and respect.
p361
aVAt the same time, we need to think locally,
p362
aVwhich is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish,
p363
aVis that we can shine a spotlight
p364
aVon many of these previously unknown areas,
p365
aVand to bring people to the table, if you will,
p366
aVto actually make them feel part of this community
p367
aVthat truly has a stake
p368
aVin their future management.
p369
aVAnd third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.
p370
aVOur species are ocean-basin-wide.
p371
aVMany of the deep-sea communities
p372
aVhave genetic distribution
p373
aVthat goes ocean-basin-wide.
p374
aVWe need to better understand,
p375
aVbut we also need to start to manage and protect.
p376
aVAnd in order to do that,
p377
aVyou also need ocean-basin management regimes.
p378
aVThat is, we have regional management regimes
p379
aVwithin the exclusive economic zone,
p380
aVbut we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity,
p381
aVso they're like the Southern Ocean,
p382
aVwhere they do have the two-pronged fisheries
p383
aVand conservation organization.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor
p386
aVSylvia Earle for her wish,
p387
aVfor it is helping us to put a face on the high seas
p388
aVand the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.
p389
aVIt's helping to bring an incredible group
p390
aVof talented people together
p391
aVto really try to solve and penetrate
p392
aVthese problems that have created our obstacles
p393
aVto management and rational use
p394
aVof this area that was once so far away and remote.
p395
aa(lp396
VSo on this tour, I hope I provided you
p397
aVwith a new perspective of the high seas:
p398
aVone, that it is our home too,
p399
aVand that we need to work together
p400
aVif we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.
p401
aa(lp402
VThank you.

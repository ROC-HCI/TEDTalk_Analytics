VAllow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.
p5
aVYou know that all over the world,
p6
aVpeople fight for their freedom,
p7
aVfight for their rights.
p8
aVSome battle oppressive governments.
p9
aVOthers battle oppressive societies.
p10
aVWhich battle do you think is harder?
p11
aVAllow me to try to answer this question
p12
aVin the few coming minutes.
p13
aa(lp14
VLet me take you back two years ago in my life.
p15
aVIt was the bedtime of my son, Aboody.
p16
aVHe was five at the time.
p17
aVAfter finishing his bedtime rituals,
p18
aVhe looked at me and he asked a question:
p19
aV"Mommy, are we bad people?"
p20
aa(lp21
VI was shocked.
p22
aV"Why do you say such things, Aboody?"
p23
aa(lp24
VEarlier that day, I noticed some bruises
p25
aVon his face when he came from school.
p26
aVHe wouldn't tell me what happened.
p27
aV[But now] he was ready to tell.
p28
aa(lp29
V"Two boys hit me today in school.
p30
aVThey told me, 'We saw your mom on Facebook.
p31
aVYou and your mom should be put in jail.'"
p32
aa(lp33
VI've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything.
p34
aVI've been always a proud woman of my achievements.
p35
aVBut those questioning eyes of my son
p36
aVwere my moment of truth,
p37
aVwhen it all came together.
p38
aVYou see, I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail
p39
aVfor driving a car in a country
p40
aVwhere women are not supposed to drive cars.
p41
aVJust for giving me his car keys,
p42
aVmy own brother was detained twice,
p43
aVand he was harassed to the point he had
p44
aVto quit his job as a geologist,
p45
aVleave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.
p46
aVMy father had to sit in a Friday sermon
p47
aVlistening to the imam condemning women drivers
p48
aVand calling them prostitutes
p49
aVamongst tons of worshippers,
p50
aVsome of them our friends and family of my own father.
p51
aVI was faced with an organized defamation campaign
p52
aVin the local media combined with false rumors
p53
aVshared in family gatherings, in the streets
p54
aVand in schools.
p55
aVIt all hit me.
p56
aVIt came into focus that those kids
p57
aVdid not mean to be rude to my son.
p58
aVThey were just influenced by the adults around them.
p59
aVAnd it wasn't about me, and it wasn't a punishment
p60
aVfor taking the wheel and driving a few miles.
p61
aVIt was a punishment for daring to challenge
p62
aVthe society's rules.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine.
p65
aVAllow me to give you a briefing
p66
aVabout my story.
p67
aVIt was May, 2011,
p68
aVand I was complaining to a work colleague
p69
aVabout the harassments I had to face
p70
aVtrying to find a ride back home,
p71
aValthough I have a car and an international driver's license.
p72
aVAs long as I've known, women in Saudi Arabia
p73
aVhave been always complaining about the ban,
p74
aVbut it's been 20 years since anyone
p75
aVtried to do anything about it,
p76
aVa whole generation ago.
p77
aa(lp78
VHe broke the good/bad news in my face.
p79
aV"But there is no law banning you from driving."
p80
aa(lp81
VI looked it up, and he was right.
p82
aVThere wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia.
p83
aVIt was just a custom and traditions
p84
aVthat are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas
p85
aVand imposed on women.
p86
aVThat realization ignited the idea of June 17,
p87
aVwhere we encouraged women to take the wheel
p88
aVand go drive.
p89
aVIt was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these
p90
aV"Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive."
p91
aVA courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri,
p92
aVshe's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah,
p93
aVshe drove a car and she announced
p94
aVbut she didn't record a video.
p95
aVWe needed proof.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo I drove. I posted a video on YouTube.
p98
aVAnd to my surprise,
p99
aVit got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.
p100
aVWhat happened next, of course?
p101
aVI started receiving threats
p102
aVto be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign.
p103
aa(lp104
VThe Saudi authorities remained very quiet.
p105
aVThat really creeped us out.
p106
aVI was in the campaign with other Saudi women
p107
aVand even men activists.
p108
aVWe wanted to know how the authorities
p109
aVwould respond on the actual day, June 17,
p110
aVwhen women go out and drive.
p111
aVSo this time I asked my brother
p112
aVto come with me and drive by a police car.
p113
aVIt went fast. We were arrested,
p114
aVsigned a pledge not to drive again, released.
p115
aVArrested again, he was sent to detention for one day,
p116
aVand I was sent to jail.
p117
aVI wasn't sure why I was sent there,
p118
aVbecause I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.
p119
aVBut what I was sure of was my innocence.
p120
aVI didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya
p121
aV\u2014 it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house \u2014
p122
aVand my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off,
p123
aVbut I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying,
p124
aV"No, I'm leaving today."
p125
aVOutside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy,
p126
aVsome attacking me badly,
p127
aVand others supportive and even collecting signatures
p128
aVin a petition to be sent to the king to release me.
p129
aVI was released after nine days.
p130
aa(lp131
VJune 17 comes.
p132
aVThe streets were packed with police cars
p133
aVand religious police cars,
p134
aVbut some hundred brave Saudi women
p135
aVbroke the ban and drove that day.
p136
aVNone were arrested. We broke the taboo.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Applause)
p139
aa(lp140
VSo I think by now, everyone knows that we can't drive,
p141
aVor women are not allowed to drive, in Saudi Arabia,
p142
aVbut maybe few know why.
p143
aVAllow me to help you answer this question.
p144
aa(lp145
VThere was this official study
p146
aVthat was presented to the Shura Council \u2014
p147
aVit's the consultative council appointed
p148
aVby the king in Saudi Arabia \u2014
p149
aVand it was done by a local professor,
p150
aVa university professor.
p151
aVHe claims it's done based on a UNESCO study.
p152
aVAnd the study states,
p153
aVthe percentage of rape, adultery,
p154
aVillegitimate children, even drug abuse,
p155
aVprostitution in countries where women drive
p156
aVis higher than countries where women don't drive.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VI know, I was like this, I was shocked.
p161
aVI was like, "We are the last country in the world
p162
aVwhere women don't drive."
p163
aVSo if you look at the map of the world,
p164
aVthat only leaves two countries:
p165
aVSaudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world.
p166
aa(lp167
VWe started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study,
p168
aVand it made headlines around the world.
p169
aa(lp170
V[BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns]
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd only then we realized it's so empowering
p175
aVto mock your oppressor.
p176
aVIt strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear.
p177
aa(lp178
VThis system is based on ultra-conservative
p179
aVtraditions and customs
p180
aVthat deal with women as if they are inferior
p181
aVand they need a guardian to protect them,
p182
aVso they need to take permission from this guardian,
p183
aVwhether verbal or written, all their lives.
p184
aVWe are minors until the day we die.
p185
aVAnd it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas
p186
aVbased on wrong interpretation of the sharia law,
p187
aVor the religious laws.
p188
aVWhat's worst, when they become codified
p189
aVas laws in the system,
p190
aVand when women themselves believe in their inferiority,
p191
aVand they even fight those who try
p192
aVto question these rules.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face.
p195
aVIt was about living two totally different
p196
aVperceptions of my personality, of my person \u2014
p197
aVthe villain back in my home country,
p198
aVand the hero outside.
p199
aa(lp200
VJust to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years.
p201
aVOne of them is when I was in jail.
p202
aVI'm pretty sure when I was in jail,
p203
aVeveryone saw titles in the international media
p204
aVsomething like this during these nine days I was in jail.
p205
aa(lp206
VBut in my home country, it was a totally different picture.
p207
aVIt was more like this:
p208
aV"Manal al-Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order
p209
aVand inciting women to drive."
p210
aa(lp211
VI know.
p212
aa(lp213
V"Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign."
p214
aa(lp215
VAh, it's okay. This is my favorite.
p216
aa(lp217
V"Manal al-Sharif breaks down and confesses:
p218
aV'Foreign forces incited me.'"
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd it goes on, even trial and flogging me in public.
p223
aVSo it's a totally different picture.
p224
aa(lp225
VI was asked last year to give a speech
p226
aVat the Oslo Freedom Forum.
p227
aVI was surrounded by this love
p228
aVand the support of people around me,
p229
aVand they looked at me as an inspiration.
p230
aVAt the same time, I flew back to my home country,
p231
aVthey hated that speech so much.
p232
aVThe way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country
p233
aVand the Saudi people,
p234
aVand they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter.
p235
aVSome 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag,
p236
aVwhile the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero,
p237
aVthere was like a handful of tweets written.
p238
aVThey even started a poll.
p239
aVMore than 13,000 voters answered this poll:
p240
aVwhether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech.
p241
aVNinety percent said yes, she's a traitor.
p242
aVSo it's these two totally different perceptions
p243
aVof my personality.
p244
aa(lp245
VFor me, I'm a proud Saudi woman,
p246
aVand I do love my country,
p247
aVand because I love my country, I'm doing this.
p248
aVBecause I believe a society will not be free
p249
aVif the women of that society are not free.
p250
aV(Applause)
p251
aVThank you.
p252
aV(Applause)
p253
aVThank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
p254
aV(Applause)
p255
aa(lp256
VThank you.
p257
aa(lp258
VBut you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.
p259
aVI learned to be always there.
p260
aVThe first thing, I got out of jail,
p261
aVof course after I took a shower, I went online,
p262
aVI opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page,
p263
aVand I've been always very respectful
p264
aVto those people who are opining to me.
p265
aVI would listen to what they say,
p266
aVand I would never defend myself with words only.
p267
aVI would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign,
p268
aVI filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate
p269
aVof traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license.
p270
aVThere are a lot of people also \u2014
p271
aVvery big support, like those 3,000 people
p272
aVwho signed the petition to release me.
p273
aVWe sent a petition to the Shura Council
p274
aVin favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women,
p275
aVand there were, like, 3,500 citizens who believed in that
p276
aVand they signed that petition.
p277
aVThere were people like that, I just showed some examples,
p278
aVwho are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia,
p279
aVand trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate
p280
aVbecause of speaking up and voicing their views.
p281
aa(lp282
VSaudi Arabia today is taking small steps
p283
aVtoward enhancing women's rights.
p284
aVThe Shura Council that's appointed by the king,
p285
aVby royal decree of King Abdullah,
p286
aVlast year there were 30 women assigned to that Council,
p287
aVlike 20 percent.
p288
aV20 percent of the Council. (Applause)
p289
aVThe same time, finally, that Council,
p290
aVafter rejecting our petition four times for women driving,
p291
aVthey finally accepted it last February.
p292
aV(Applause)
p293
aVAfter being sent to jail
p294
aVor sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial,
p295
aVthe spokesperson of the traffic police said,
p296
aVwe will only issue traffic violation for women drivers.
p297
aVThe Grand Mufti, who is the head
p298
aVof the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia,
p299
aVhe said, it's not recommended for women to drive.
p300
aVIt used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo for me, it's not about only these small steps.
p303
aVIt's about women themselves.
p304
aa(lp305
VA friend once asked me, she said,
p306
aV"So when do you think this women driving will happen?"
p307
aa(lp308
VI told her, "Only if women stop asking 'When?'
p309
aVand take action to make it now."
p310
aa(lp311
VSo it's not only about the system,
p312
aVit's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo I have no clue, really, how I became an activist.
p315
aVAnd I don't know how I became one now.
p316
aVBut all I know, and all I'm sure of, in the future
p317
aVwhen someone asks me my story,
p318
aVI will say, "I'm proud
p319
aVto be amongst those women who lifted the ban,
p320
aVfought the ban, and celebrated everyone's freedom."
p321
aa(lp322
VSo the question I started my talk with,
p323
aVwho do you think is more difficult to face,
p324
aVoppressive governments or oppressive societies?
p325
aVI hope you find clues to answer that from my speech.
p326
aa(lp327
VThank you, everyone.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Applause)
p330
aVThank you.
p331
aV(Applause)
p332
aVThank you. (Applause)

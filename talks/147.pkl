VI'm a medical illustrator,
p5
aVand I come from a slightly different point of view.
p6
aVI've been watching, since I grew up,
p7
aVthe expressions of truth and beauty in the arts
p8
aVand truth and beauty in the sciences.
p9
aVAnd while these are both wonderful things in their own right \u2014
p10
aVthey both have very wonderful things going for them \u2014
p11
aVtruth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences
p12
aVand by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins
p13
aVthat a scientist would want to date.
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVThese are expressions of truth as awe-full things,
p16
aVby meaning they are things you can worship.
p17
aVThey are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.
p18
aVThey are unique. They are useful \u2014
p19
aVsometimes, often a long time after the fact.
p20
aVAnd you can actually roll some of the pictures now,
p21
aVbecause I don't want to look at me on the screen.
p22
aa(lp23
VTruth and beauty are things
p24
aVthat are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.
p25
aVThey are things that describe beauty in a way
p26
aVthat is often only accessible if you understand the language
p27
aVand the syntax of the person
p28
aVwho studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.
p29
aVIf you look at the math, E=mc squared,
p30
aVif you look at the cosmological constant,
p31
aVwhere there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve
p32
aVfrom the numbers that describe the universe \u2014
p33
aVthese are things that are really difficult to understand.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd what I've tried to do
p36
aVsince I had my training as a medical illustrator \u2014
p37
aVsince I was taught animation by my father,
p38
aVwho was a sculptor and my visual mentor \u2014
p39
aVI wanted to figure out a way to help people
p40
aVunderstand truth and beauty in the biological sciences
p41
aVby using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories
p42
aVso that the things that are not necessarily evident to people
p43
aVcan be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.
p44
aa(lp45
VStudents today are often immersed in an environment
p46
aVwhere what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty
p47
aVembedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized
p48
aVand it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty
p49
aVare not always evident.
p50
aVIt's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup
p51
aVwhere you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.
p52
aVWe don't want to do that to our students.
p53
aVSo we have an opportunity to really open up education.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard,
p56
aVin the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department,
p57
aVa couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I
p58
aVwould be interested and willing to really change
p59
aVhow medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.
p60
aVSo we embarked on a project that would explore the cell \u2014
p61
aVthat would explore the truth and beauty inherent
p62
aVin molecular and cellular biology
p63
aVso that students could understand a larger picture
p64
aVthat they could hang all of these facts on.
p65
aVThey could have a mental image of the cell
p66
aVas a large, bustling, hugely complicated city
p67
aVthat's occupied by micro-machines.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.
p70
aVThese micro-machines,
p71
aVwhich are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,
p72
aVare self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices
p73
aVthat are made out of strings of amino acids.
p74
aVAnd these micro-machines power how a cell moves.
p75
aVThey power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.
p76
aVThey power our minds.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd so what we wanted to do was to figure out
p79
aVhow we could make this story into an animation
p80
aVthat would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,
p81
aVwhich is a website that Harvard has
p82
aVfor its molecular and cellular biology students
p83
aVthat will \u2014 in addition to all the textual information,
p84
aVin addition to all the didactic stuff \u2014
p85
aVput everything together visually, so that these students
p86
aVwould have an internalized view of what a cell really is
p87
aVin all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study
p88
aVwith this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,
p89
aVso that their passions would be sparked
p90
aVand so that they would be able to go on
p91
aVand use these visions in their head to make new discoveries
p92
aVand to be able to find out, really, how life works.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.
p95
aVWe worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages
p96
aVthat are streaming down a capillary,
p97
aVand they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,
p98
aVand they're picking up information from cells
p99
aVthat are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information
p100
aVthat there's an inflammation somewhere outside,
p101
aVwhere they can't see and sense.
p102
aVBut they get the information that causes them to stop,
p103
aVcauses them to internalize that they need to make
p104
aVall of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,
p105
aVand try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo these molecular motors \u2014 we had to work
p108
aVwith the Harvard scientists and databank models
p109
aVof the atomically accurate molecules
p110
aVand figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.
p111
aVAnd figure out how to do this in a way
p112
aVthat was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,
p113
aVbut not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell
p114
aVwould prevent the vista from happening.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute
p117
aVReader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film
p118
aVthat we produced. It's an ongoing project
p119
aVthat's going to go another four or five years.
p120
aVAnd I want you to look at this
p121
aVand see the paths that the cell manufactures \u2014
p122
aVthese little walking machines, they're called kinesins \u2014
p123
aVthat take these huge loads
p124
aVthat would challenge an ant in relative size.
p125
aVRun the movie, please.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut these machines that power the inside of the cells
p128
aVare really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life
p129
aVbecause all of these machines interact with each other.
p130
aVThey pass information to each other.
p131
aVThey cause different things to happen inside the cell.
p132
aVAnd the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs
p133
aVon the fly, from information
p134
aVthat's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.
p135
aVNo life, from the smallest life to everybody here,
p136
aVwould be possible without these little micro-machines.
p137
aVIn fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,
p138
aVhave made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aV(Music)
p141
aa(lp142
VThis is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.
p143
aVThis little guy is called the kinesin,
p144
aVand he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins
p145
aVto wherever it's needed in the cell \u2014
p146
aVwhether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,
p147
aVwhether it's to build something or repair something.
p148
aVAnd each of us has about 100,000 of these things
p149
aVrunning around, right now,
p150
aVinside each one of your 100 trillion cells.
p151
aVSo no matter how lazy you feel,
p152
aVyou're not really intrinsically doing nothing.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VSo what I want you to do when you go home
p156
aVis think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.
p157
aVAnd think about some of the things
p158
aVthat we're learning about cellular mechanics.
p159
aVOnce we figure out all that's going on \u2014
p160
aVand believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on \u2014
p161
aVonce we figure out what's going on,
p162
aVwe're really going to be able to have a lot of control
p163
aVover what we do with our health,
p164
aVwith what we do with future generations,
p165
aVand how long we're going to live.
p166
aVAnd hopefully we'll be able to use this
p167
aVto discover more truth, and more beauty.
p168
aV(Music)
p169
aa(lp170
VBut it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines,
p171
aVare aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.
p172
aVThey work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.
p173
aVAnd their working together helps our bodies \u2014
p174
aVhuge entities that they will never see \u2014 function properly.
p175
aVEnjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.
p176
aV(Applause)

Now, with <a href=\\"http://www.xvivo.net/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">XVIVO</a>, the company he co-founded, he works with schools and with medical and scientific firms, <strong>turning complex processes into understandable, compelling films</strong>.<br /><br />&quot;The Inner Life of a Cell,&quot; highlighted at TED2007, represents the leading edge of medical animation, in both its technical achievement and <strong>its focus on compelling, memorable action</strong>. Created as part of the BioVision initiative to help explain cellular processes to students at <a href=\\"http://www.mcb.harvard.edu/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Harvard&#39;s Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology</a>, the clip has captured the imagination of the press -- and reportedly, of Hollywood.</p>", "slug": "david_bolinsky", "whotheyare": "David Bolinsky and his team illustrate scientific and medical concepts with high-drama animation.

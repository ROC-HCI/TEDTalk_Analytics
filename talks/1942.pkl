VThis is a vending machine in Los Angeles.
p5
aVIt's in a shopping mall, and it sells fish eggs.
p6
aVIt's a caviar-vending machine.
p7
aa(lp8
VThis is the Art-o-mat, an art-vending machine
p9
aVthat sells small artistic creations by different artists,
p10
aVusually on small wood blocks or matchboxes, in limited edition.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is Oliver Medvedik.
p13
aVHe is not a vending machine, but he is one of the founders of Genspace,
p14
aVa community biolab in Brooklyn, New York,
p15
aVwhere anybody can go and take classes
p16
aVand learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark
p17
aVor learn how to take strawberry DNA.
p18
aVIn fact, I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions
p19
aVabout a year ago, and this is what led me into this bizarre path
p20
aVthat I'm going to talk to you right now.
p21
aVStrawberry DNA is really fascinating, because it's so beautiful.
p22
aVI'd never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before,
p23
aVbefore I saw it in this form.
p24
aVA lot of people, especially in the art community,
p25
aVdon't necessarily engage in science in this way.
p26
aVI instantly joined Genspace after this,
p27
aVand asked Oliver, "If we can do this with strawberries,
p28
aVcan we do this with people?"
p29
aVAbout 10 minutes later, we were both spitting in vials,
p30
aVcoming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction.
p31
aVI started doing this on my own.
p32
aVThis is what my DNA actually looks like.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd I was at a dinner party with some artist friends,
p35
aVand I was telling them about this project,
p36
aVand they couldn't believe that you could actually see DNA.
p37
aVSo I said, all right, let's get out some supplies right now.
p38
aVAnd I started having these bizarre dinner parties on Friday nights,
p39
aVwhere people would come over and we'd do DNA extractions,
p40
aVand I would capture them on video,
p41
aVbecause it created this kind of funny portrait as well.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VThese are people who don't necessarily regularly engage with science.
p46
aVYou can kind of tell from their reactions.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VBut they became fascinated by it,
p51
aVand it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd so I started doing this regularly.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VIt's an odd thing to do with your Friday nights,
p58
aVbut this is what I started doing.
p59
aVI started collecting a whole group of my friends' DNA in small vials
p60
aVand categorizing them.
p61
aVThis is what that looked like.
p62
aVAnd it started to make me think about a couple of things.
p63
aVFirst, this looked a lot like my Facebook wall.
p64
aVSo in a way, I created sort of a genetic social network.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd the second thing was,
p67
aVone time a friend came over and looked at this on my table
p68
aVand was like,  "Uh ... why are they numbered?
p69
aVIs this person more rare than the other one?"
p70
aVAnd I hadn't even thought about that.
p71
aVThey were just numbered
p72
aVbecause that was the order that I extracted the DNA in.
p73
aVBut that made me think about collecting toys,
p74
aVand what's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys,
p75
aVand being able to collect these rare toys.
p76
aVYou buy these boxes, but aren't sure what's going to be inside.
p77
aVBut when you open them, you have different rarities of the toys.
p78
aVI thought that was interesting; I thought about this
p79
aVand the caviar vending machine and the Art-o-mat all together.
p80
aVAnd for some reason, I was one night drawing a vending machine,
p81
aVthinking of doing paintings of a vending machine.
p82
aVThe vial of my DNA was sitting there,
p83
aVand I saw a beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA
p84
aVand the coils of a vending machine.
p85
aVSo I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine.
p86
aVHere it is.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Music)
p89
aa(lp90
V[DNA Vending Machine is an art installation
p91
aVabout our increasing access to biotechnology.]
p92
aa(lp93
V(Music)
p94
aa(lp95
V[For a reasonable cost, you can purchase a sample of human DNA
p96
aVfrom a traditional vending machine.]
p97
aa(lp98
V(Music)
p99
aa(lp100
V[Each sample comes packaged
p101
aVwith a collectible limited edition portrait of the human specimen.]
p102
aa(lp103
V(Music)
p104
aa(lp105
V[DNA Vending Machine treats DNA as a collectible material
p106
aVand brings to light legal issues over the ownership of DNA.]
p107

p109
aa(lp110
VGabriel Barcia-Colombo:
p111
aVThe DNA Vending Machine is currently in a couple of galleries in New York,
p112
aVand it's selling out pretty well.
p113
aVWe're in the first edition of 100 pieces,
p114
aVhoping to do another edition pretty soon.
p115
aVI'd like to get it into more of a metro hub,
p116
aVlike Grand Central or Penn Station,
p117
aVnext to some of the other vending machines in that location.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut really, with this and a lot of my art projects,
p120
aVI want to ask the audience a question:
p121
aVWhen biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting
p122
aVor 3D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine,
p123
aVwill you submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine?
p124
aVHow much will these samples be worth?
p125
aVWill you buy someone else's sample?
p126
aVAnd what will you be able to do with that sample?
p127
aa(lp128
VThank you.

His latest work is a DNA Vending Machine, which dispenses vials of DNA extracted from friends at dinner parties. He&#39;s also created video installations of &quot;miniature people&quot; encased inside ordinary objects like suitcases,  blenders and more. His work comments on the act of leaving one&#39;s imprint for the next generation.  Call it &quot;artwork with consequences.&quot;</p><p>As he explains it: &quot;While formally implemented by natural history museums and collections  (which find their roots in Renaissance-era &#39;cabinets of curiosity&#39;),  this process has grown more pointed and pervasive in the modern-day  obsession with personal digital archiving and the corresponding growth  of social media culture. My video sculptures play upon this exigency in  our culture to chronicle, preserve and wax nostalgic, an idea which I  render visually by &#39;collecting&#39; human beings (alongside cultural  archetypes) as scientific specimens. I repurpose everyday objects like blenders, suitcases and cans of Spam  into venues for projecting and inserting videos of people.&quot; </p><p>Barcia-Colombo is an alumnus and instructor at NYU&#39;s <a href=\\"http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Interactive Telecommunications Program</a>.

American artist who creates installation pieces that both delight and point to the strangeness of our modern, digital world. His latest work is a DNA Vending Machine, which dispenses vials of DNA extracted from friends at dinner parties. He&#39;s also created video installations of &quot;miniature people&quot; encased inside ordinary objects like suitcases,  blenders and more. His work comments on the act of leaving one&#39;s imprint for the next generation.  Call it &quot;artwork with consequences.&quot;</p><p>As he explains it: &quot;While formally implemented by natural history museums and collections  (which find their roots in Renaissance-era &#39;cabinets of curiosity&#39;),  this process has grown more pointed and pervasive in the modern-day  obsession with personal digital archiving and the corresponding growth  of social media culture. My video sculptures play upon this exigency in  our culture to chronicle, preserve and wax nostalgic, an idea which I  render visually by &#39;collecting&#39; human beings (alongside cultural  archetypes) as scientific specimens. I repurpose everyday objects like blenders, suitcases and cans of Spam  into venues for projecting and inserting videos of people.&quot; </p><p>Barcia-Colombo is an alumnus and instructor at NYU&#39;s <a href=\\"http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Interactive Telecommunications Program</a>.

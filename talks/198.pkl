VI want to start my story in Germany, in 1877,
p5
aVwith a mathematician named Georg Cantor.
p6
aVAnd Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line,
p7
aVand then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process, a recursive process.
p8
aVSo he starts out with one line, and then two,
p9
aVand then four, and then 16, and so on.
p10
aVAnd if he does this an infinite number of times, which you can do in mathematics,
p11
aVhe ends up with an infinite number of lines,
p12
aVeach of which has an infinite number of points in it.
p13
aVSo he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity.
p14
aVAnd this blew his mind. Literally. He checked into a sanitarium. (Laughter)
p15
aVAnd when he came out of the sanitarium,
p16
aVhe was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory
p17
aVbecause the largest set of infinity would be God Himself.
p18
aVHe was a very religious man.
p19
aVHe was a mathematician on a mission.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd other mathematicians did the same sort of thing.
p22
aVA Swedish mathematician, von Koch,
p23
aVdecided that instead of subtracting lines, he would add them.
p24
aVAnd so he came up with this beautiful curve.
p25
aVAnd there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape;
p26
aVwe can use any seed shape we like.
p27
aVAnd I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere \u2014 down there, OK \u2014
p28
aVand now upon iteration, that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure.
p29
aVSo these all have the property of self-similarity:
p30
aVthe part looks like the whole.
p31
aVIt's the same pattern at many different scales.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, mathematicians thought this was very strange
p34
aVbecause as you shrink a ruler down, you measure a longer and longer length.
p35
aVAnd since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times,
p36
aVas the ruler shrinks down to infinity, the length goes to infinity.
p37
aVThis made no sense at all,
p38
aVso they consigned these curves to the back of the math books.
p39
aVThey said these are pathological curves, and we don't have to discuss them.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVAnd that worked for a hundred years.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd then in 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot, a French mathematician,
p44
aVrealized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals,
p45
aVyou get the shapes of nature.
p46
aVYou get the human lungs, you get acacia trees, you get ferns,
p47
aVyou get these beautiful natural forms.
p48
aVIf you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet \u2014
p49
aVgo ahead and do that now \u2014
p50
aV\u2014 and relax your hand, you'll see a crinkle,
p51
aVand then a wrinkle within the crinkle, and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right?
p52
aVYour body is covered with fractals.
p53
aVThe mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes?
p54
aVThey were breathing those words with fractal lungs.
p55
aVIt's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here.
p56
aVAgain, we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape.
p57
aVSo here's the second iteration, and the third, fourth and so on.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo nature has this self-similar structure.
p60
aVNature uses self-organizing systems.
p61
aVNow in the 1980s, I happened to notice
p62
aVthat if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals.
p63
aVAnd I thought, "This is fabulous! I wonder why?"
p64
aVAnd of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why.
p65
aVSo I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year
p66
aVasking people why they were building fractals,
p67
aVwhich is a great job if you can get it.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city
p71
aVjust to see how it would sort of unfold \u2014
p72
aVbut when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief,
p73
aVand my French is not very good; I said something like,
p74
aV"I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof."
p75
aVBut he was really cool about it, and he took me up there,
p76
aVand we talked about fractals.
p77
aVAnd he said, "Oh yeah, yeah! We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle,
p78
aVwe know all about that."
p79
aVAnd it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle,
p80
aVand the path through that palace is actually this spiral here.
p81
aVAnd as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite.
p82
aVSo they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling;
p83
aVit's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal.
p84
aa(lp85
VThis is a village in southern Zambia.
p86
aVThe Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter.
p87
aVYou have a huge ring.
p88
aVThe rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back,
p89
aVand then you have the chief's ring here towards the back
p90
aVand then the chief's immediate family in that ring.
p91
aVSo here's a little fractal model for it.
p92
aVHere's one house with the sacred altar,
p93
aVhere's the house of houses, the family enclosure,
p94
aVwith the humans here where the sacred altar would be,
p95
aVand then here's the village as a whole \u2014
p96
aVa ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here, the chief's immediate family here,
p97
aVand here there's a tiny village only this big.
p98
aVNow you might wonder, how can people fit in a tiny village only this big?
p99
aVThat's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors.
p100
aVAnd of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village, right?
p101
aVSo it's just like Georg Cantor said, the recursion continues forever.
p102
aa(lp103
VThis is in the Mandara mountains, near the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Mokoulek.
p104
aVI saw this diagram drawn by a French architect,
p105
aVand I thought, "Wow! What a beautiful fractal!"
p106
aVSo I tried to come up with a seed shape, which, upon iteration, would unfold into this thing.
p107
aVI came up with this structure here.
p108
aVLet's see, first iteration, second, third, fourth.
p109
aVNow, after I did the simulation,
p110
aVI realized the whole village kind of spirals around, just like this,
p111
aVand here's that replicating line \u2014 a self-replicating line that unfolds into the fractal.
p112
aVWell, I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at.
p113
aVSo, when I got to the village,
p114
aVI said, "Can you take me to the square building?
p115
aVI think something's going on there."
p116
aVAnd they said, "Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside
p117
aVbecause that's the sacred altar, where we do sacrifices every year
p118
aVto keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields."
p119
aVAnd I started to realize that the cycles of fertility
p120
aVwere just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this.
p121
aVAnd the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo here's a Nankani village in Mali.
p124
aVAnd you can see, you go inside the family enclosure \u2014
p125
aVyou go inside and here's pots in the fireplace, stacked recursively.
p126
aVHere's calabashes that Issa was just showing us,
p127
aVand they're stacked recursively.
p128
aVNow, the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman's soul.
p129
aVAnd when she dies, they have a ceremony
p130
aVwhere they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity.
p131
aVOnce again, infinity is important.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, you might ask yourself three questions at this point.
p134
aVAren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture?
p135
aVAnd that was actually my original hypothesis.
p136
aVWhen I first saw those African fractals,
p137
aVI thought, "Wow, so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society,
p138
aVthat sort of hierarchy, must have a kind of bottom-up architecture."
p139
aVBut that turns out not to be true.
p140
aa(lp141
VI started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture;
p142
aVonly the African ones were fractal.
p143
aVAnd if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use.
p144
aVSo Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry.
p145
aVYou can see on the pottery and the baskets.
p146
aVHere's an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins;
p147
aVyou can see it's circular at the largest scale, but it's rectangular at the smaller scale, right?
p148
aVIt is not the same pattern at two different scales.
p149
aa(lp150
VSecond, you might ask,
p151
aV"Well, Dr. Eglash, aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures?"
p152
aVAnd three times, the answer is no.
p153
aVFirst of all, I agree with Mudimbe's wonderful book, "The Invention of Africa,"
p154
aVthat Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism,
p155
aVand then oppositional movements.
p156
aVNo, because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture \u2014
p157
aVand it definitely is not "in the DNA."
p158
aVAnd finally, the fractals have self-similarity \u2014
p159
aVso they're similar to themselves, but they're not necessarily similar to each other \u2014
p160
aVyou see very different uses for fractals.
p161
aVIt's a shared technology in Africa.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd finally, well, isn't this just intuition?
p164
aVIt's not really mathematical knowledge.
p165
aVAfricans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry, right?
p166
aVIt wasn't invented until the 1970s.
p167
aVWell, it's true that some African fractals are, as far as I'm concerned, just pure intuition.
p168
aVSo some of these things, I'd wander around the streets of Dakar
p169
aVasking people, "What's the algorithm? What's the rule for making this?"
p170
aVand they'd say,
p171
aV"Well, we just make it that way because it looks pretty, stupid." (Laughter)
p172
aVBut sometimes, that's not the case.
p173
aVIn some cases, there would actually be algorithms, and very sophisticated algorithms.
p174
aVSo in Manghetu sculpture, you'd see this recursive geometry.
p175
aVIn Ethiopian crosses, you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape.
p176
aa(lp177
VIn Angola, the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand,
p178
aVand it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph;
p179
aVwe now call it an Eulerian path \u2014
p180
aVyou can never lift your stylus from the surface
p181
aVand you can never go over the same line twice.
p182
aVBut they do it recursively, and they do it with an age-grade system,
p183
aVso the little kids learn this one, and then the older kids learn this one,
p184
aVthen the next age-grade initiation, you learn this one.
p185
aVAnd with each iteration of that algorithm,
p186
aVyou learn the iterations of the myth.
p187
aVYou learn the next level of knowledge.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd finally, all over Africa, you see this board game.
p190
aVIt's called Owari in Ghana, where I studied it;
p191
aVit's called Mancala here on the East Coast, Bao in Kenya, Sogo elsewhere.
p192
aVWell, you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game.
p193
aVAnd the folks in Ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns
p194
aVand would use them strategically.
p195
aVSo this is very conscious knowledge.
p196
aa(lp197
VHere's a wonderful fractal.
p198
aVAnywhere you go in the Sahel, you'll see this windscreen.
p199
aVAnd of course fences around the world are all Cartesian, all strictly linear.
p200
aVBut here in Africa, you've got these nonlinear scaling fences.
p201
aVSo I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things,
p202
aVthis guy in Mali just outside of Bamako, and I asked him,
p203
aV"How come you're making fractal fences? Because nobody else is."
p204
aVAnd his answer was very interesting.
p205
aVHe said, "Well, if I lived in the jungle, I would only use the long rows of straw
p206
aVbecause they're very quick and they're very cheap.
p207
aVIt doesn't take much time, doesn't take much straw."
p208
aVHe said, "but wind and dust goes through pretty easily.
p209
aVNow, the tight rows up at the very top, they really hold out the wind and dust.
p210
aVBut it takes a lot of time, and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight."
p211
aV"Now," he said, "we know from experience
p212
aVthat the farther up from the ground you go, the stronger the wind blows."
p213
aVRight? It's just like a cost-benefit analysis.
p214
aVAnd I measured out the lengths of straw,
p215
aVput it on a log-log plot, got the scaling exponent,
p216
aVand it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height
p217
aVin the wind engineering handbook.
p218
aVSo these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology.
p219
aa(lp220
VThe most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found
p221
aVwas actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code,
p222
aVand this was Bamana sand divination.
p223
aVAnd the same divination system is found all over Africa.
p224
aVYou can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast,
p225
aVand often the symbols are very well preserved,
p226
aVso each of these symbols has four bits \u2014 it's a four-bit binary word \u2014
p227
aVyou draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off,
p228
aVand if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke,
p229
aVand if it's an even number, you put down two strokes.
p230
aVAnd they did this very rapidly,
p231
aVand I couldn't understand where they were getting \u2014
p232
aVthey only did the randomness four times \u2014
p233
aVI couldn't understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols.
p234
aVAnd they wouldn't tell me.
p235
aVThey said, "No, no, I can't tell you about this."
p236
aVAnd I said, "Well look, I'll pay you, you can be my teacher,
p237
aVand I'll come each day and pay you."
p238
aVThey said, "It's not a matter of money. This is a religious matter."
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd finally, out of desperation, I said,
p241
aV"Well, let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877."
p242
aVAnd I started explaining why I was there in Africa,
p243
aVand they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set.
p244
aVAnd one of them said, "Come here. I think I can help you out here."
p245
aVAnd so he took me through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest.
p246
aVAnd of course, I was only interested in the math,
p247
aVso the whole time, he kept shaking his head going,
p248
aV"You know, I didn't learn it this way."
p249
aVBut I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed, buried in sand,
p250
aVand give seven coins to seven lepers and so on.
p251
aVAnd finally, he revealed the truth of the matter.
p252
aVAnd it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos.
p253
aVWhen you have a four-bit symbol, you then put it together with another one sideways.
p254
aVSo even plus odd gives you odd.
p255
aVOdd plus even gives you odd.
p256
aVEven plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even.
p257
aVIt's addition modulo 2, just like in the parity bit check on your computer.
p258
aVAnd then you take this symbol, and you put it back in
p259
aVso it's a self-generating diversity of symbols.
p260
aVThey're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this.
p261
aVNow, because it's a binary code,
p262
aVyou can actually implement this in hardware \u2014
p263
aVwhat a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical.
p266
aVIn the 12th century, Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain.
p267
aVAnd there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy:
p268
aVdivination through the earth.
p269
aVThis is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in 1390.
p270
aVLeibniz, the German mathematician,
p271
aVtalked about geomancy in his dissertation called "De Combinatoria."
p272
aVAnd he said, "Well, instead of using one stroke and two strokes,
p273
aVlet's use a one and a zero, and we can count by powers of two."
p274
aVRight? Ones and zeros, the binary code.
p275
aVGeorge Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra,
p276
aVand John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer.
p277
aVSo all these little PDAs and laptops \u2014
p278
aVevery digital circuit in the world \u2014 started in Africa.
p279
aVAnd I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers,
p280
aVbut you know, I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno.
p281
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p282
aa(lp283
VSo let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this.
p284
aVAnd you can go to our website,
p285
aVthe applets are all free; they just run in the browser.
p286
aVAnybody in the world can use them.
p287
aVThe National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program
p288
aVrecently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools,
p289
aVso hopefully in three years, anybody'll be able to go on the Web
p290
aVand create their own simulations and their own artifacts.
p291
aVWe've focused in the U.S. on African-American students as well as Native American and Latino.
p292
aVWe've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class
p293
aVin comparison with a control group that did not have the software.
p294
aVSo it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics,
p295
aVthat it's not just about singing and dancing.
p296
aVWe've started a pilot program in Ghana.
p297
aVWe got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this;
p298
aVwe're very excited about the future possibilities for that.
p299
aa(lp300
VWe've also been working in design.
p301
aVI didn't put his name up here \u2014 my colleague, Kerry, in Kenya, has come up with this great idea
p302
aVfor using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure,
p303
aVbecause if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village,
p304
aVit doesn't quite fit.
p305
aVBernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art.
p306
aVDavid Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture
p307
aVin which he's used some of these fractal structures.
p308
aa(lp309
VAnd finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization,
p310
aVas we heard earlier, it's in the brain.
p311
aVIt's in the \u2014 it's in Google's search engine.
p312
aVActually, the reason that Google was such a success
p313
aVis because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web.
p314
aVIt's in ecological sustainability.
p315
aVIt's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship,
p316
aVthe ethical power of democracy.
p317
aVIt's also in some bad things.
p318
aVSelf-organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast.
p319
aVAnd if you don't think that capitalism, which is self-organizing, can have destructive effects,
p320
aVyou haven't opened your eyes enough.
p321
aVSo we need to think about, as was spoken earlier,
p322
aVthe traditional African methods for doing self-organization.
p323
aVThese are robust algorithms.
p324
aVThese are ways of doing self-organization \u2014 of doing entrepreneurship \u2014
p325
aVthat are gentle, that are egalitarian.
p326
aVSo if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work,
p327
aVwe need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms.
p328
aVThank you.

VI was here four years ago,
p5
aVand I remember, at the time,
p6
aVthat the talks weren't put online.
p7
aVI think they were given to TEDsters in a box,
p8
aVa box set of DVDs,
p9
aVwhich they put on their shelves, where they are now.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd actually, Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk, and said,
p14
aV"We're going to start putting them online. Can we put yours online?"
p15
aVAnd I said, "Sure."
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd four years later,
p18
aVit's been downloaded four million times.
p19
aVSo I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something
p20
aVto get the number of people who've seen it.
p21
aVAnd, as Chris says, there is a hunger for videos of me.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
V(Applause)
p26
aa(lp27
VDon't you feel?
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, this whole event has been an elaborate build-up
p32
aVto me doing another one for you, so here it is.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VAl Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago
p37
aVand talked about the climate crisis.
p38
aVAnd I referenced that at the end of my last talk.
p39
aVSo I want to pick up from there
p40
aVbecause I only had 18 minutes, frankly.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, as I was saying \u2014
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VYou see, he's right.
p49
aVI mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously,
p50
aVand I think if people don't believe it, they should get out more.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VBut I believe there is a second climate crisis,
p55
aVwhich is as severe,
p56
aVwhich has the same origins,
p57
aVand that we have to deal with with the same urgency.
p58
aVAnd you may say, by the way,
p59
aV"Look, I'm good.
p60
aVI have one climate crisis, I don't really need the second one."
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VBut this is a crisis of, not natural resources \u2014
p65
aVthough I believe that's true \u2014
p66
aVbut a crisis of human resources.
p67
aa(lp68
VI believe fundamentally,
p69
aVas many speakers have said during the past few days,
p70
aVthat we make very poor use of our talents.
p71
aVVery many people go through their whole lives
p72
aVhaving no real sense of what their talents may be,
p73
aVor if they have any to speak of.
p74
aVI meet all kinds of people
p75
aVwho don't think they're really good at anything.
p76
aa(lp77
VActually, I kind of divide the world into two groups now.
p78
aVJeremy Bentham, the great utilitarian philosopher,
p79
aVonce spiked this argument.
p80
aVHe said, "There are two types of people in this world:
p81
aVthose who divide the world into two types
p82
aVand those who do not."
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VWell, I do.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VI meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do.
p91
aVThey simply go through their lives getting on with it.
p92
aVThey get no great pleasure from what they do.
p93
aVThey endure it rather than enjoy it,
p94
aVand wait for the weekend.
p95
aVBut I also meet people
p96
aVwho love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.
p97
aVIf you said, "Don't do this anymore,"
p98
aVthey'd wonder what you're talking about.
p99
aVIt isn't what they do, it's who they are.
p100
aVThey say, "But this is me, you know.
p101
aVIt would be foolish to abandon this,
p102
aVbecause it speaks to my most authentic self."
p103
aVAnd it's not true of enough people.
p104
aVIn fact, on the contrary, I think it's still true of a minority of people.
p105
aVAnd I think there are many possible explanations for it.
p106
aVAnd high among them is education,
p107
aVbecause education, in a way,
p108
aVdislocates very many people from their natural talents.
p109
aVAnd human resources are like natural resources;
p110
aVthey're often buried deep.
p111
aVYou have to go looking for them,
p112
aVthey're not just lying around on the surface.
p113
aVYou have to create the circumstances where they show themselves.
p114
aVAnd you might imagine education would be the way that happens,
p115
aVbut too often, it's not.
p116
aVEvery education system in the world is being reformed at the moment
p117
aVand it's not enough.
p118
aVReform is no use anymore,
p119
aVbecause that's simply improving a broken model.
p120
aVWhat we need \u2014
p121
aVand the word's been used many times in the past few days \u2014
p122
aVis not evolution,
p123
aVbut a revolution in education.
p124
aVThis has to be transformed into something else.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VOne of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education.
p129
aVInnovation is hard,
p130
aVbecause it means doing something that people don't find very easy,
p131
aVfor the most part.
p132
aVIt means challenging what we take for granted,
p133
aVthings that we think are obvious.
p134
aVThe great problem for reform or transformation
p135
aVis the tyranny of common sense.
p136
aVThings that people think,
p137
aV"It can't be done differently, that's how it's done."
p138
aa(lp139
VI came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln,
p140
aVwho I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VHe said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress.
p145
aVI ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time.
p146
aVWe don't teach American history in Britain.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VWe suppress it. You know, this is our policy.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VNo doubt, something fascinating was happening then,
p155
aVwhich the Americans among us will be aware of.
p156
aa(lp157
VBut he said this:
p158
aV"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.
p159
aVThe occasion is piled high with difficulty,
p160
aVand we must rise with the occasion."
p161
aVI love that.
p162
aVNot rise to it, rise with it.
p163
aV"As our case is new,
p164
aVso we must think anew and act anew.
p165
aVWe must disenthrall ourselves,
p166
aVand then we shall save our country."
p167
aa(lp168
VI love that word, "disenthrall."
p169
aVYou know what it means?
p170
aVThat there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to,
p171
aVwhich we simply take for granted as the natural order of things,
p172
aVthe way things are.
p173
aVAnd many of our ideas have been formed,
p174
aVnot to meet the circumstances of this century,
p175
aVbut to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries.
p176
aVBut our minds are still hypnotized by them,
p177
aVand we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them.
p178
aVNow, doing this is easier said than done.
p179
aVIt's very hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted.
p180
aVAnd the reason is that you take it for granted.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VLet me ask you something you may take for granted.
p185
aVHow many of you here are over the age of 25?
p186
aVThat's not what you take for granted, I'm sure you're familiar with that.
p187
aVAre there any people here under the age of 25?
p188
aVGreat. Now, those over 25,
p189
aVcould you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch?
p190
aVNow that's a great deal of us, isn't it?
p191
aVAsk a room full of teenagers the same thing.
p192
aVTeenagers do not wear wristwatches.
p193
aVI don't mean they can't,
p194
aVthey just often choose not to.
p195
aVAnd the reason is we were brought up in a pre-digital culture,
p196
aVthose of us over 25.
p197
aVAnd so for us, if you want to know the time,
p198
aVyou have to wear something to tell it.
p199
aVKids now live in a world which is digitized,
p200
aVand the time, for them, is everywhere.
p201
aVThey see no reason to do this.
p202
aVAnd by the way, you don't need either;
p203
aVit's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it.
p204
aVMy daughter never wears a watch, my daughter Kate, who's 20.
p205
aVShe doesn't see the point.
p206
aVAs she says,
p207
aV"It's a single-function device."
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
V"Like, how lame is that?"
p212
aVAnd I say, "No, no, it tells the date as well."
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
V"It has multiple functions."
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VBut, you see, there are things we're enthralled to in education.
p221
aVA couple of examples.
p222
aVOne of them is the idea of linearity:
p223
aVthat it starts here and you go through a track
p224
aVand if you do everything right,
p225
aVyou will end up set for the rest of your life.
p226
aVEverybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly,
p227
aVor sometimes explicitly, a different story:
p228
aVthat life is not linear; it's organic.
p229
aVWe create our lives symbiotically
p230
aVas we explore our talents
p231
aVin relation to the circumstances they help to create for us.
p232
aVBut, you know, we have become obsessed with this linear narrative.
p233
aVAnd probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college.
p234
aVI think we are obsessed with getting people to college.
p235
aVCertain sorts of college.
p236
aVI don't mean you shouldn't go, but not everybody needs to go,
p237
aVor go now.
p238
aVMaybe they go later, not right away.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing.
p241
aVThere was this guy buying a book, he was in his 30s.
p242
aVI said, "What do you do?"
p243
aVAnd he said, "I'm a fireman."
p244
aVI asked, "How long have you been a fireman?"
p245
aV"Always. I've always been a fireman."
p246
aV"Well, when did you decide?" He said, "As a kid.
p247
aVActually, it was a problem for me at school,
p248
aVbecause at school, everybody wanted to be a fireman."
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VHe said, "But I wanted to be a fireman."
p253
aVAnd he said, "When I got to the senior year of school,
p254
aVmy teachers didn't take it seriously.
p255
aVThis one teacher didn't take it seriously.
p256
aVHe said I was throwing my life away
p257
aVif that's all I chose to do with it;
p258
aVthat I should go to college, I should become a professional person,
p259
aVthat I had great potential
p260
aVand I was wasting my talent to do that."
p261
aVHe said, "It was humiliating.
p262
aVIt was in front of the whole class and I felt dreadful.
p263
aVBut it's what I wanted, and as soon as I left school,
p264
aVI applied to the fire service and I was accepted.
p265
aVYou know, I was thinking about that guy recently,
p266
aVjust a few minutes ago when you were speaking, about this teacher,
p267
aVbecause six months ago, I saved his life."
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VHe said, "He was in a car wreck, and I pulled him out, gave him CPR,
p272
aVand I saved his wife's life as well."
p273
aVHe said, "I think he thinks better of me now."
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
V(Applause)
p278
aa(lp279
VYou know, to me,
p280
aVhuman communities depend upon a diversity of talent,
p281
aVnot a singular conception of ability.
p282
aVAnd at the heart of our challenges \u2014
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VAt the heart of the challenge
p287
aVis to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence.
p288
aVThis linearity thing is a problem.
p289
aa(lp290
VWhen I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago,
p291
aVI came across a policy statement \u2014
p292
aVvery well-intentioned \u2014
p293
aVwhich said, "College begins in kindergarten."
p294
aVNo, it doesn't.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VIt doesn't.
p299
aVIf we had time, I could go into this, but we don't.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VKindergarten begins in kindergarten.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VA friend of mine once said,
p308
aV"A three year-old is not half a six year-old."
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
V(Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
VThey're three.
p315
aa(lp316
VBut as we just heard in this last session,
p317
aVthere's such competition now to get into kindergarten \u2014
p318
aVto get to the right kindergarten \u2014
p319
aVthat people are being interviewed for it at three.
p320
aVKids sitting in front of unimpressed panels,
p321
aVyou know, with their resumes \u2014
p322
aa(lp323
V(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VFlicking through and saying, "What, this is it?"
p326
aa(lp327
V(Laughter)
p328
aa(lp329
V(Applause)
p330
aa(lp331
V"You've been around for 36 months, and this is it?"
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
V"You've achieved nothing \u2014 commit.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VSpent the first six months breastfeeding, I can see."
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VSee, it's outrageous as a conception.
p344
aa(lp345
VThe other big issue is conformity.
p346
aVWe have built our education systems on the model of fast food.
p347
aVThis is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day.
p348
aVThere are two models of quality assurance in catering.
p349
aVOne is fast food, where everything is standardized.
p350
aVThe other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants,
p351
aVwhere everything is not standardized,
p352
aVthey're customized to local circumstances.
p353
aVAnd we have sold ourselves into a fast-food model of education,
p354
aVand it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies
p355
aVas much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
VWe have to recognize a couple of things here.
p360
aVOne is that human talent is tremendously diverse.
p361
aVPeople have very different aptitudes.
p362
aVI worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid
p363
aVat about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.
p364
aa(lp365
V(Laughter)
p366
aa(lp367
VIt worked out for Eric, that's all I'm saying.
p368
aa(lp369
V(Laughter)
p370
aa(lp371
VIn a way \u2014
p372
aVit did not for me.
p373
aVI could not get this thing to work
p374
aVno matter how often or how hard I blew into it.
p375
aVIt just wouldn't work.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VBut it's not only about that.
p380
aVIt's about passion.
p381
aVOften, people are good at things they don't really care for.
p382
aVIt's about passion,
p383
aVand what excites our spirit and our energy.
p384
aVAnd if you're doing the thing that you love to do, that you're good at,
p385
aVtime takes a different course entirely.
p386
aVMy wife's just finished writing a novel,
p387
aVand I think it's a great book,
p388
aVbut she disappears for hours on end.
p389
aVYou know this, if you're doing something you love,
p390
aVan hour feels like five minutes.
p391
aVIf you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit,
p392
aVfive minutes feels like an hour.
p393
aVAnd the reason so many people are opting out of education
p394
aVis because it doesn't feed their spirit,
p395
aVit doesn't feed their energy or their passion.
p396
aa(lp397
VSo I think we have to change metaphors.
p398
aVWe have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education,
p399
aVa manufacturing model,
p400
aVwhich is based on linearity and conformity and batching people.
p401
aVWe have to move to a model
p402
aVthat is based more on principles of agriculture.
p403
aVWe have to recognize
p404
aVthat human flourishing is not a mechanical process;
p405
aVit's an organic process.
p406
aVAnd you cannot predict the outcome of human development.
p407
aVAll you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions
p408
aVunder which they will begin to flourish.
p409
aa(lp410
VSo when we look at reforming education and transforming it,
p411
aVit isn't like cloning a system.
p412
aVThere are great ones, like KIPP's; it's a great system.
p413
aVThere are many great models.
p414
aVIt's about customizing to your circumstances
p415
aVand personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching.
p416
aVAnd doing that, I think, is the answer to the future
p417
aVbecause it's not about scaling a new solution;
p418
aVit's about creating a movement in education
p419
aVin which people develop their own solutions,
p420
aVbut with external support based on a personalized curriculum.
p421
aa(lp422
VNow in this room,
p423
aVthere are people who represent extraordinary resources in business,
p424
aVin multimedia, in the Internet.
p425
aVThese technologies,
p426
aVcombined with the extraordinary talents of teachers,
p427
aVprovide an opportunity to revolutionize education.
p428
aVAnd I urge you to get involved in it
p429
aVbecause it's vital, not just to ourselves, but to the future of our children.
p430
aVBut we have to change from the industrial model
p431
aVto an agricultural model,
p432
aVwhere each school can be flourishing tomorrow.
p433
aVThat's where children experience life.
p434
aVOr at home, if that's what they choose,
p435
aVto be educated with their families or friends.
p436
aa(lp437
VThere's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of these few days.
p438
aVAnd I wanted to just very quickly \u2014
p439
aVI was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night,
p440
aVrecovering old poems.
p441
aVI wanted to read you a quick, very short poem
p442
aVfrom W. B. Yeats, who some of you may know.
p443
aVHe wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne,
p444
aVand he was bewailing the fact
p445
aVthat he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him.
p446
aVAnd he says, "I've got something else, but it may not be for you."
p447
aa(lp448
VHe says this:
p449
aV"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
p450
aVEnwrought with gold and silver light,
p451
aVThe blue and the dim and the dark cloths
p452
aVOf night and light and the half-light,
p453
aVI would spread the cloths under your feet:
p454
aVBut I, being poor, have only my dreams;
p455
aVI have spread my dreams under your feet;
p456
aVTread softly
p457
aVbecause you tread on my dreams."
p458
aVAnd every day, everywhere,
p459
aVour children spread their dreams beneath our feet.
p460
aVAnd we should tread softly.
p461
aa(lp462
VThank you.
p463
aa(lp464
V(Applause)
p465
aa(lp466
VThank you very much.
p467
aa(lp468
V(Applause)
p469
aa(lp470
VThank you.

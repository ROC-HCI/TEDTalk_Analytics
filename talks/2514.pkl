VOK, first, some introductions.
p5
aVMy mom, Jennie, took this picture.
p6
aVThat's my dad, Frank, in the middle.
p7
aVAnd on his left, my sisters:
p8
aVMary Catherine, Judith Ann, Theresa Marie.
p9
aVJohn Patrick's sitting on his lap and Kevin Michael's on his right.
p10
aVAnd in the pale-blue windbreaker,
p11
aVSusan Diane. Me.
p12
aVI loved growing up in a big family.
p13
aVAnd one of my favorite things was picking names.
p14
aVBut by the time child number seven came along,
p15
aVwe had nearly run out of middle names.
p16
aVIt was a long deliberation
p17
aVbefore we finally settled on Jennifer Bridget.
p18
aVEvery parent in this audience
p19
aVknows the joy and excitement
p20
aVof picking a new baby's name.
p21
aVAnd I was excited and thrilled
p22
aVto help my mom in that special ceremonial moment.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut it's not like that everywhere.
p25
aVI travel a lot and I see a lot.
p26
aVBut it took me by surprise to learn
p27
aVin an area of Ethiopia,
p28
aVparents delay picking the names for their new babies
p29
aVby a month or more.
p30
aVWhy delay?
p31
aVWhy not take advantage of this special ceremonial time?
p32
aVWell, they delay because they're afraid.
p33
aVThey're afraid their baby will die.
p34
aVAnd this loss might be a little more bearable without a name.
p35
aVA face without a name might help them feel
p36
aVjust a little less attached.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo here we are in one part of the world \u2014
p39
aVa time of joy, excitement, dreaming of the future of that child \u2014
p40
aVwhile in another world,
p41
aVparents are filled with dread,
p42
aVnot daring to dream of a future for their child
p43
aVbeyond a few precious weeks.
p44
aVHow can that be?
p45
aVHow can it be that 2.6 million babies
p46
aVdie around the world
p47
aVbefore they're even one month old?
p48
aV2.6 million.
p49
aVThat's the population of Vancouver.
p50
aVAnd the shocking thing is:
p51
aVWhy?
p52
aVIn too many cases, we simply don't know.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, I remember recently seeing an updated pie chart.
p55
aVAnd the pie chart was labeled,
p56
aV"Causes of death in children under five worldwide."
p57
aVAnd there was a pretty big section of that pie chart, about 40 percent \u2014
p58
aV40 percent was labeled "neonatal."
p59
aVNow, "neonatal" is not a cause of death.
p60
aVNeonatal is simply an adjective,
p61
aVan adjective that means that the child is less than one month old.
p62
aVFor me, "neonatal" said: "We have no idea."
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor.
p65
aVI want to fix things.
p66
aVBut you can't fix what you can't define.
p67
aVSo our first step in restoring the dreams of those parents
p68
aVis to answer the question:
p69
aVWhy are babies dying?
p70
aa(lp71
VSo today, I want to talk about a new approach,
p72
aVan approach that I feel
p73
aVwill not only help us know why babies are dying,
p74
aVbut is beginning to completely transform
p75
aVthe whole field of global health.
p76
aVIt's called "Precision Public Health."
p77
aa(lp78
VFor me, precision medicine comes from a very special place.
p79
aVI trained as a cancer doctor, an oncologist.
p80
aVI got into it because I wanted to help people feel better.
p81
aVBut too often my treatments made them feel worse.
p82
aVI still remember young women being driven to my clinic
p83
aVby their moms \u2014
p84
aVadults, who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers.
p85
aVThey were so weak
p86
aVfrom the treatment I had given them.
p87
aVBut at the time, in those front lines in the war on cancer,
p88
aVwe had few tools.
p89
aVAnd the tools we did have couldn't differentiate
p90
aVbetween the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard
p91
aVand those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve.
p92
aVAnd so the side effects that you're all very familiar with \u2014
p93
aVhair loss, being sick to your stomach,
p94
aVhaving a suppressed immune system, so infection was a constant threat \u2014
p95
aVwere always surrounding us.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd then I moved to the biotechnology industry.
p98
aVAnd I got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients
p99
aVthat could do a better job of telling the healthy cells
p100
aVfrom the unhealthy or cancer cells.
p101
aVIt's a drug called Herceptin.
p102
aVAnd what Herceptin allowed us to do
p103
aVis to precisely target HER2-positive breast cancer,
p104
aVat the time, the scariest form of breast cancer.
p105
aVAnd that precision let us hit hard the cancer cells,
p106
aVwhile sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells.
p107
aVA huge breakthrough.
p108
aVIt felt like a miracle,
p109
aVso much so that today,
p110
aVwe're harnessing all those tools \u2014
p111
aVbig data, consumer monitoring, gene sequencing and more \u2014
p112
aVto tackle a broad variety of diseases.
p113
aVThat's allowing us to target individuals
p114
aVwith the right remedies at the right time.
p115
aa(lp116
VPrecision medicine revolutionized cancer therapy.
p117
aVEverything changed.
p118
aVAnd I want everything to change again.
p119
aVSo I've been asking myself:
p120
aVWhy should we limit
p121
aVthis smarter, more precise, better way to tackle diseases
p122
aVto the rich world?
p123
aVNow, don't misunderstand me \u2014
p124
aVI'm not talking about bringing expensive medicines like Herceptin
p125
aVto the developing world,
p126
aValthough I'd actually kind of like that.
p127
aVWhat I am talking about
p128
aVis moving from this precise targeting for individuals
p129
aVto tackle public health problems
p130
aVin populations.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, OK, I know probably you're thinking, "She's crazy.
p133
aVYou can't do that. That's too ambitious."
p134
aVBut here's the thing:
p135
aVwe're already doing this in a limited way,
p136
aVand it's already starting to make a big difference.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo here's what's happening.
p139
aVNow, I told you I trained as a cancer doctor.
p140
aVBut like many, many doctors who trained in San Francisco in the '80s,
p141
aVI also trained as an AIDS doctor.
p142
aVIt was a terrible time.
p143
aVAIDS was a death sentence.
p144
aVAll my patients died.
p145
aVNow, things are better,
p146
aVbut HIV/AIDS remains a terrible global challenge.
p147
aVWorldwide, about 17 million women are living with HIV.
p148
aVWe know that when these women become pregnant,
p149
aVthey can transfer the virus to their baby.
p150
aVWe also know in the absence of therapy,
p151
aVhalf those babies will not survive until the age of two.
p152
aVBut we know that antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee
p153
aVthat she will not transmit the virus to the baby.
p154
aVSo what do we do?
p155
aa(lp156
VWell, a one-size-fits-all approach, kind of like that blast of chemo,
p157
aVwould mean we test and treat every pregnant woman in the world.
p158
aVThat would do the job.
p159
aVBut it's just not practical.
p160
aVSo instead, we target those areas where HIV rates are the highest.
p161
aVWe know in certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa
p162
aVwe can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest.
p163
aVThis precision approach to a public health problem
p164
aVhas cut by nearly half
p165
aVHIV transmission from mothers to baby
p166
aVin the last five years.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Applause)
p169
aa(lp170
VScreening pregnant women in certain areas in the developing world
p171
aVis a powerful example
p172
aVof how precision public health can change things on a big scale.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo ...
p175
aVHow do we do that?
p176
aVWe can do that because we know.
p177
aVWe know who to target,
p178
aVwhat to target,
p179
aVwhere to target and how to target.
p180
aVAnd that, for me, are the important  elements of precision public health:
p181
aVwho, what, where and how.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut let's go back to the 2.6 million babies
p184
aVwho die before they're one month old.
p185
aVHere's the problem: we just don't know.
p186
aVIt may seem unbelievable,
p187
aVbut the way we figure out the causes of infant mortality
p188
aVin those countries with the highest infant mortality
p189
aVis a conversation with mom.
p190
aVA health worker asks a mom who has just lost her child,
p191
aV"Was the baby vomiting? Did they have a fever?"
p192
aVAnd that conversation may take place
p193
aVas long as three months after the baby has died.
p194
aVNow, put yourself in the shoes of that mom.
p195
aVIt's a heartbreaking, excruciating conversation.
p196
aVAnd even worse \u2014 it's not that helpful,
p197
aVbecause we might know there was a fever or vomiting,
p198
aVbut we don't know why.
p199
aVSo in the absence of knowing that knowledge,
p200
aVwe cannot prevent that mom, that family,
p201
aVor other families in that community
p202
aVfrom suffering the same tragedy.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut what if we applied a precision public health approach?
p205
aVLet's say, for example,
p206
aVwe find out in certain areas of Africa
p207
aVthat babies are dying because of a bacterial infection
p208
aVtransferred from the mother to the baby,
p209
aVknown as Group B streptococcus.
p210
aVIn the absence of treatment, mom has a seven times higher chance
p211
aVthat her next baby will die.
p212
aVOnce we define the problem, we can prevent that death
p213
aVwith something as cheap and safe as penicillin.
p214
aVWe can do that because then we'll know.
p215
aVAnd that's the point:
p216
aVonce we know, we can bring the right interventions
p217
aVto the right population in the right places
p218
aVto save lives.
p219
aa(lp220
VWith this approach, and with these interventions
p221
aVand others like them,
p222
aVI have no doubt
p223
aVthat a precision public health approach
p224
aVcan help our world achieve our 15-year goal.
p225
aVAnd that would translate into a million babies' lives saved
p226
aVevery single year.
p227
aVOne million babies every single year.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd why would we stop there?
p230
aVA much more powerful approach to public health \u2014
p231
aVimagine what might be possible.
p232
aVWhy couldn't we more effectively tackle malnutrition?
p233
aVWhy wouldn't we prevent cervical cancer in women?
p234
aVAnd why not eradicate malaria?
p235
aa(lp236
V(Applause)
p237
aa(lp238
VYes, clap for that!
p239
aa(lp240
V(Applause)
p241
aa(lp242
VSo, you know, I live in two different worlds,
p243
aVone world populated by scientists,
p244
aVand another world populated by public health professionals.
p245
aVThe promise of precision public health
p246
aVis to bring these two worlds together.
p247
aVBut you know, we all live in two worlds:
p248
aVthe rich world and the poor world.
p249
aVAnd what I'm most excited about about precision public health
p250
aVis bridging these two worlds.
p251
aVEvery day in the rich world,
p252
aVwe're bringing incredible talent and tools \u2014
p253
aVeverything at our disposal \u2014
p254
aVto precisely target diseases in ways I never imagined
p255
aVwould be possible.
p256
aVSurely, we can tap into that kind of talent and tools
p257
aVto stop babies dying in the poor world.
p258
aVIf we did,
p259
aVthen every parent would have the confidence
p260
aVto name their child the moment that child is born,
p261
aVdaring to dream that that child's life will be measured in decades,
p262
aVnot days.
p263
aa(lp264
VThank you.

class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">As CEO of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Sue Desmond-Hellmann leads the organization&#39;s vision for a world where every person has the opportunity to live a healthy, productive life. Drawing on her diverse experience as scientist, physician and business executive, she oversees a variety of missions focused on eradicating disease, poverty and inequity. She leads 1,400 people, across four continents, working in more than 100 countries to help more children and young people survive and thrive, combat infectious diseases that hit the poorest hardest, and empower people -- particularly women and girls -- to transform their lives.</span></p><p class=\\"p1\\">Trained as an oncologist, Dr. Desmond-Hellmann spent 14 years at biotech firm Genentech, developing a number of breakthrough medicines, including two of the first gene-targeted therapies for cancer, Avastin and Herceptin. In November 2009, <em>Forbes</em> magazine named her one of the world&#39;s seven most &quot;powerful innovators,&quot; calling her &quot;a hero to legions of cancer patients.&quot; Her time at Genentech put her at the forefront of the precision medicine revolution, and in her current role she champions a similar approach to global development: precision public health -- getting the right interventions, to the right populations, in the right places, to save lives.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Immediately prior to joining the foundation in 2014, Dr. Desmond-Hellmann was the first female chancellor of the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), overseeing all aspects of the university and medical center&#39;s strategy and operations. It was her second stint at UCSF, having completed her clinical training there in the 1980s. She moved to Uganda in 1989 to work on HIV/AIDS and cancer, which she credits as a turning point in her career. &quot;It was so profound to recognize ... that all the learning I had done to become a doctor didn&#39;t matter at all if I didn&rsquo;t make a contribution,&quot; she said.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Dr. Desmond-Hellmann is the recipient of numerous honors and awards. She was listed among <em>Fortune</em> magazine&#39;s &quot;50 most powerful women in business&quot; for seven years. In 2010, she was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and elected to the Institute of Medicine. She serves on the boards of directors at Facebook Inc. and the Procter &amp; Gamble Company.</p>", "slug": "sue_desmond_hellman", "whotheyare": "Sue Desmond-Hellmann leads the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\\u2019s mission to establish equity for every person.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 2901, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/4140b997e862b73e0d5f755ba37c59f0087267af_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "A smarter, more precise way to think about public health", "take_action": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "link_url": "http://www.gatesfoundation.org/2016/ceo-letter?wt.mc_id=05_23_2016_00_ceoletter16_sdh-ted_&wt.tsrc=sdhted", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "verb": "learn", "published": true, "visible_url": "gatesfoundation.org", "type": "take_action", "blurb": "**Read** Gates Foundation CEO Letter."}], "comments": 27132, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "Be careful what you wish for", "link_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/careful-what-you-wish-sue-desmond-hellmann", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "linkedin.com", "type": "external_website", "blurb": "Sue Desmond-Hellman describes her journey to the TED stage."}], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/3e41e5e908157decc853f9b7f71b543f09a84003_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Sue Desmond-Hellmann is using precision public health -- an approach that incorporates big data, consumer monitoring, gene sequencing and other innovative tools -- to solve the world\'s most difficult medical problems.

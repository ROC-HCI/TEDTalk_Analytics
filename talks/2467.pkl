VCancer affects all of us \u2014
p5
aVespecially the ones that come back over and over again,
p6
aVthe highly invasive and drug-resistant ones,
p7
aVthe ones that defy medical treatment,
p8
aVeven when we throw our best drugs at them.
p9
aVEngineering at the molecular level,
p10
aVworking at the smallest of scales,
p11
aVcan provide exciting new ways
p12
aVto fight the most aggressive forms of cancer.
p13
aa(lp14
VCancer is a very clever disease.
p15
aVThere are some forms of cancer,
p16
aVwhich, fortunately, we've learned how to address relatively well
p17
aVwith known and established drugs and surgery.
p18
aVBut there are some forms of cancer
p19
aVthat don't respond to these approaches,
p20
aVand the tumor survives or comes back,
p21
aVeven after an onslaught of drugs.
p22
aa(lp23
VWe can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer
p24
aVas kind of supervillains in a comic book.
p25
aVThey're clever, they're adaptable,
p26
aVand they're very good at staying alive.
p27
aVAnd, like most supervillains these days,
p28
aVtheir superpowers come from a genetic mutation.
p29
aVThe genes that are modified inside these tumor cells
p30
aVcan enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival,
p31
aVallowing the cancer cell to live through
p32
aVeven our best chemotherapy treatments.
p33
aa(lp34
VOne example is a trick in which a gene allows a cell,
p35
aVeven as the drug approaches the cell,
p36
aVto push the drug out,
p37
aVbefore the drug can have any effect.
p38
aVImagine \u2014 the cell effectively spits out the drug.
p39
aVThis is just one example of the many genetic tricks
p40
aVin the bag of our supervillain, cancer.
p41
aVAll due to mutant genes.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo, we have a supervillain with incredible superpowers.
p44
aVAnd we need a new and powerful mode of attack.
p45
aVActually, we can turn off a gene.
p46
aVThe key is a set of molecules known as siRNA.
p47
aVsiRNA are short sequences of genetic code
p48
aVthat guide a cell to block a certain gene.
p49
aVEach siRNA molecule can turn off a specific gene
p50
aVinside the cell.
p51
aVFor many years since its discovery,
p52
aVscientists have been very excited
p53
aVabout how we can apply these gene blockers in medicine.
p54
aa(lp55
VBut, there is a problem.
p56
aVsiRNA works well inside the cell.
p57
aVBut if it gets exposed to the enzymes
p58
aVthat reside in our bloodstream or our tissues,
p59
aVit degrades within seconds.
p60
aVIt has to be packaged, protected through its journey through the body
p61
aVon its way to the final target inside the cancer cell.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo, here's our strategy.
p64
aVFirst, we'll dose the cancer cell with siRNA, the gene blocker,
p65
aVand silence those survival genes,
p66
aVand then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.
p67
aVBut how do we carry that out?
p68
aVUsing molecular engineering,
p69
aVwe can actually design a superweapon
p70
aVthat can travel through the bloodstream.
p71
aVIt has to be tiny enough to get through the bloodstream,
p72
aVit's got to be small enough to penetrate the tumor tissue,
p73
aVand it's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell.
p74
aVTo do this job well,
p75
aVit has to be about one one-hundredth the size of a human hair.
p76
aa(lp77
VLet's take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle.
p78
aVFirst, let's start with the nanoparticle core.
p79
aVIt's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug.
p80
aVThis is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell's life.
p81
aVAround this core, we'll wrap a very thin,
p82
aVnanometers-thin blanket of siRNA.
p83
aVThis is our gene blocker.
p84
aVBecause siRNA is strongly negatively charged,
p85
aVwe can protect it
p86
aVwith a nice, protective layer of positively charged polymer.
p87
aVThe two oppositely charged molecules stick together
p88
aVthrough charge attraction,
p89
aVand that provides us with a protective layer
p90
aVthat prevents the siRNA from degrading in the bloodstream.
p91
aVWe're almost done.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VBut there is one more big obstacle we have to think about.
p96
aVIn fact, it may be the biggest obstacle of all.
p97
aVHow do we deploy this superweapon?
p98
aVI mean, every good weapon needs to be targeted,
p99
aVwe have to target this superweapon to the supervillain cells
p100
aVthat reside in the tumor.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut our bodies have a natural immune-defense system:
p103
aVcells that reside in the bloodstream
p104
aVand pick out things that don't belong,
p105
aVso that it can destroy or eliminate them.
p106
aVAnd guess what? Our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object.
p107
aVWe have to sneak our nanoparticle past the tumor defense system.
p108
aVWe have to get it past this mechanism of getting rid of the foreign object
p109
aVby disguising it.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo we add one more negatively charged layer
p112
aVaround this nanoparticle,
p113
aVwhich serves two purposes.
p114
aVFirst, this outer layer is one of the naturally charged,
p115
aVhighly hydrated polysaccharides that resides in our body.
p116
aVIt creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanoparticle
p117
aVthat gives us an invisibility cloaking effect.
p118
aVThis invisibility cloak allows the nanoparticle
p119
aVto travel through the bloodstream
p120
aVlong and far enough to reach the tumor,
p121
aVwithout getting eliminated by the body.
p122
aa(lp123
VSecond, this layer contains molecules
p124
aVwhich bind specifically to our tumor cell.
p125
aVOnce bound, the cancer cell takes up the nanoparticle,
p126
aVand now we have our nanoparticle inside the cancer cell
p127
aVand ready to deploy.
p128
aa(lp129
VAlright! I feel the same way. Let's go!
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VThe siRNA is deployed first.
p134
aVIt acts for hours,
p135
aVgiving enough time to silence and block those survival genes.
p136
aVWe have now disabled those genetic superpowers.
p137
aVWhat remains is a cancer cell with no special defenses.
p138
aVThen, the chemotherapy drug comes out of the core
p139
aVand destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently.
p140
aVWith sufficient gene blockers,
p141
aVwe can address many different kinds of mutations,
p142
aVallowing the chance to sweep out tumors,
p143
aVwithout leaving behind any bad guys.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo, how does our strategy work?
p146
aVWe've tested these nanostructure particles in animals
p147
aVusing a highly aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer.
p148
aVThis triple-negative breast cancer exhibits the gene
p149
aVthat spits out cancer drug as soon as it is delivered.
p150
aa(lp151
VUsually, doxorubicin \u2014 let's call it "dox" \u2014 is the cancer drug
p152
aVthat is the first line of treatment for breast cancer.
p153
aVSo, we first treated our animals with a dox core, dox only.
p154
aVThe tumor slowed their rate of growth,
p155
aVbut they still grew rapidly,
p156
aVdoubling in size over a period of two weeks.
p157
aa(lp158
VThen, we tried our combination superweapon.
p159
aVA nanolayer particle with siRNA against the chemo pump,
p160
aVplus, we have the dox in the core.
p161
aVAnd look \u2014 we found that not only did the tumors stop growing,
p162
aVthey actually decreased in size
p163
aVand were eliminated in some cases.
p164
aVThe tumors were actually regressing.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Applause)
p167
aa(lp168
VWhat's great about this approach is that it can be personalized.
p169
aVWe can add many different layers of siRNA
p170
aVto address different mutations and tumor defense mechanisms.
p171
aVAnd we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core.
p172
aVAs doctors learn how to test patients
p173
aVand understand certain tumor genetic types,
p174
aVthey can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy
p175
aVand which gene blockers we can use.
p176
aa(lp177
VOvarian cancer strikes a special chord with me.
p178
aVIt is a very aggressive cancer,
p179
aVin part because it's discovered at very late stages,
p180
aVwhen it's highly advanced
p181
aVand there are a number of genetic mutations.
p182
aVAfter the first round of chemotherapy,
p183
aVthis cancer comes back for 75 percent of patients.
p184
aVAnd it usually comes back in a drug-resistant form.
p185
aVHigh-grade ovarian cancer
p186
aVis one of the biggest supervillains out there.
p187
aVAnd we're now directing our superweapon
p188
aVtoward its defeat.
p189
aa(lp190
VAs a researcher,
p191
aVI usually don't get to work with patients.
p192
aVBut I recently met a mother
p193
aVwho is an ovarian cancer survivor, Mimi, and her daughter, Paige.
p194
aVI was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength
p195
aVthat both mother and daughter displayed
p196
aVand by their story of courage and support.
p197
aVAt this event, we spoke about the different technologies
p198
aVdirected at cancer.
p199
aVAnd Mimi was in tears
p200
aVas she explained how learning about these efforts
p201
aVgives her hope for future generations,
p202
aVincluding her own daughter.
p203
aVThis really touched me.
p204
aVIt's not just about building really elegant science.
p205
aVIt's about changing people's lives.
p206
aVIt's about understanding the power of engineering
p207
aVon the scale of molecules.
p208
aa(lp209
VI know that as students like Paige move forward in their careers,
p210
aVthey'll open new possibilities
p211
aVin addressing some of the big health problems in the world \u2014
p212
aVincluding ovarian cancer, neurological disorders, infectious disease \u2014
p213
aVjust as chemical engineering has found a way to open doors for me,
p214
aVand has provided a way of engineering
p215
aVon the tiniest scale, that of molecules,
p216
aVto heal on the human scale.
p217
aa(lp218
VThank you.

VIt can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.
p5
aVAnd it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.
p6
aVAnd bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task,
p7
aVbut what I'm going to try to say is that
p8
aVeven in that complexity,
p9
aVthere's some simple themes that I think,
p10
aVif we understand, we can really move forward.
p11
aVAnd those simple themes aren't really
p12
aVthemes about the complex science of what's going on,
p13
aVbut things that we all pretty well know.
p14
aVAnd I'm going to start with this one:
p15
aVIf momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
p16
aVWe know that, right? We've experienced that.
p17
aVAnd if we just take that
p18
aVand we build from there,
p19
aVthen we can go to the next step,
p20
aVwhich is that if the ocean ain't happy,
p21
aVain't nobody happy.
p22
aVThat's the theme of my talk.
p23
aVAnd we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.
p24
aa(lp25
VThis is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.
p26
aVCannery Row, at the time,
p27
aVhad the biggest industrial
p28
aVcanning operation on the west coast.
p29
aVWe piled enormous amounts of pollution
p30
aVinto the air and into the water.
p31
aVRolf Bolin, who was a professor
p32
aVat the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work,
p33
aVwrote in the 1940s that
p34
aV"The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay
p35
aVwere so bad they turned
p36
aVlead-based paints black."
p37
aVPeople working in these canneries
p38
aVcould barely stay there all day because of the smell,
p39
aVbut you know what they came out saying?
p40
aVThey say, "You know what you smell?
p41
aVYou smell money."
p42
aVThat pollution was money to that community,
p43
aVand those people dealt with the pollution
p44
aVand absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies
p45
aVbecause they needed the money.
p46
aVWe made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy,
p47
aVand we made them unhealthy.
p48
aa(lp49
VThe connection between ocean health and human health
p50
aVis actually based upon another couple simple adages,
p51
aVand I want to call that
p52
aV"pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."
p53
aVThe pyramid of ocean life ...
p54
aVNow, when an ecologist looks at the ocean \u2014 I have to tell you \u2014
p55
aVwe look at the ocean in a very different way,
p56
aVand we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean
p57
aVbecause when an ecologist looks at the ocean,
p58
aVwe see all those interconnections.
p59
aVWe see the base of the food chain,
p60
aVthe plankton, the small things,
p61
aVand we see how those animals
p62
aVare food to animals in the middle of the pyramid,
p63
aVand on so up this diagram.
p64
aVAnd that flow, that flow of life,
p65
aVfrom the very base up to the very top,
p66
aVis the flow that ecologists see.
p67
aVAnd that's what we're trying to preserve
p68
aVwhen we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."
p69
aVIt's that pyramid.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow why does that matter for human health?
p72
aVBecause when we jam things in the bottom
p73
aVof that pyramid that shouldn't be there,
p74
aVsome very frightening things happen.
p75
aVPollutants, some pollutants have been created by us:
p76
aVmolecules like PCBs
p77
aVthat can't be broken down by our bodies.
p78
aVAnd they go in the base of that pyramid,
p79
aVand they drift up; they're passed up that way,
p80
aVon to predators and on to the top predators,
p81
aVand in so doing,
p82
aVthey accumulate.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.
p85
aVWe don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.
p86
aVIt's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.
p87
aVImagine that when we got on this boat,
p88
aVwe were all given
p89
aVtwo Styrofoam peanuts.
p90
aVCan't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.
p91
aVSuppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink,
p92
aVyou give them the drink,
p93
aVand you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.
p94
aVWhat'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts
p95
aVwill start moving through our society here,
p96
aVand they will accumulate in
p97
aVthe drunkest, stingiest people.
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVThere's no mechanism in this game
p100
aVfor them to go anywhere but into
p101
aVa bigger and bigger pile
p102
aVof indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.
p103
aVAnd that's exactly what happens with PDBs
p104
aVin this food pyramid:
p105
aVThey accumulate into the top of it.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow suppose, instead of Styrofoam peanuts,
p108
aVwe take these lovely little chocolates that we get
p109
aVand we had those instead.
p110
aVWell, some of us would be eating those chocolates
p111
aVinstead of passing them around,
p112
aVand instead of accumulating,
p113
aVthey will just pass into our group here
p114
aVand not accumulate in any one group
p115
aVbecause they're absorbed by us.
p116
aVAnd that's the difference between a PCB
p117
aVand, say, something natural like an omega-3,
p118
aVsomething we want out of the marine food chain.
p119
aa(lp120
VPCBs accumulate.
p121
aVWe have great examples of that, unfortunately.
p122
aVPCBs accumulate in dolphins
p123
aVin Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.
p124
aVThey get into the food chain.
p125
aVThe dolphins eat the fish
p126
aVthat have PCBs from the plankton,
p127
aVand those PCBs, being fat-soluble,
p128
aVaccumulate in these dolphins.
p129
aVNow, a dolphin,
p130
aVmother dolphin, any dolphin \u2014
p131
aVthere's only one way
p132
aVthat a PCB can get out of a dolphin.
p133
aVAnd what's that?
p134
aVIn mother's milk.
p135
aVHere's a diagram of the PCB load
p136
aVof dolphins in Sarasota Bay.
p137
aVAdult males: a huge load.
p138
aVJuveniles: a huge load.
p139
aVFemales after their first calf is already weaned:
p140
aVa lower load.
p141
aVThose females, they're not trying to.
p142
aVThose females are passing the PCBs
p143
aVin the fat of their own mother's milk
p144
aVinto their offspring,
p145
aVand their offspring don't survive.
p146
aVThe death rate in these dolphins,
p147
aVfor the first calf born of every female dolphin,
p148
aVis 60 to 80 percent.
p149
aVThese mothers pump their first offspring
p150
aVfull of this pollutant,
p151
aVand most of them die.
p152
aVNow, the mother then can go and reproduce,
p153
aVbut what a terrible price to pay
p154
aVfor the accumulation of this pollutant
p155
aVin these animals \u2014
p156
aVthe death of the first-born calf.
p157
aa(lp158
VThere's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.
p159
aVThat top predator, of course, is us.
p160
aVAnd we also are eating meat
p161
aVthat comes from some of these same places.
p162
aVThis is whale meat
p163
aVthat I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo \u2014
p164
aVor is it?
p165
aVIn fact, what we did a few years ago
p166
aVwas learn how to smuggle
p167
aVa molecular biology lab into Tokyo
p168
aVand use it to genetically test the DNA
p169
aVout of whale meat samples
p170
aVand identify what they really were.
p171
aVAnd some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.
p172
aVSome of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.
p173
aVThat's another story.
p174
aVBut some of them were not whale meat at all.
p175
aVEven though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.
p176
aVSome of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.
p177
aVAnd those dolphin parts
p178
aVhad a huge load of PCBs,
p179
aVdioxins and heavy metals.
p180
aVAnd that huge load was passing into the people
p181
aVthat ate this meat.
p182
aVIt turns out that a lot of dolphins
p183
aVare being sold as meat
p184
aVin the whale meat market around the world.
p185
aVThat's a tragedy for those populations,
p186
aVbut it's also a tragedy
p187
aVfor the people eating them
p188
aVbecause they don't know that that's toxic meat.
p189
aa(lp190
VWe had these data a few years ago.
p191
aVI remember sitting at my desk
p192
aVbeing about the only person in the world
p193
aVwho knew that whale meat being sold in these markets
p194
aVwas really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.
p195
aVIt had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads
p196
aVever allowed by the EPA.
p197
aVAnd I remember there sitting at my desk thinking,
p198
aV"Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery,"
p199
aVbut it was so awful.
p200
aVAnd for the very first time in my scientific career,
p201
aVI broke scientific protocol,
p202
aVwhich is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals
p203
aVand then begin to talk about them.
p204
aVWe sent a very polite letter
p205
aVto the Minister of Health in Japan
p206
aVand simply pointed out that
p207
aVthis is an intolerable situation, not for us,
p208
aVbut for the people of Japan
p209
aVbecause mothers who may be breastfeeding,
p210
aVwho may have young children,
p211
aVwould be buying something that they thought was healthy,
p212
aVbut it was really toxic.
p213
aVThat led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan,
p214
aVand I'm really proud to say that at this point,
p215
aVit's very difficult to buy anything in Japan
p216
aVthat's labeled incorrectly,
p217
aVeven though they're still selling whale meat,
p218
aVwhich I believe they shouldn't.
p219
aVBut at least it's labeled correctly,
p220
aVand you're no longer going to be buying
p221
aVtoxic dolphin meat instead.
p222
aa(lp223
VIt isn't just there that this happens,
p224
aVbut in a natural diet of some communities
p225
aVin the Canadian arctic and in the United States
p226
aVand in the European arctic,
p227
aVa natural diet of seals and whales
p228
aVleads to an accumulation of PCBs
p229
aVthat have gathered up from all parts of the world
p230
aVand ended up in these women.
p231
aVThese women have toxic breast milk.
p232
aVThey cannot feed their offspring, their children,
p233
aVtheir breast milk
p234
aVbecause of the accumulation of these toxins
p235
aVin their food chain,
p236
aVin their part of the world's
p237
aVocean pyramid.
p238
aVThat means their immune systems are compromised.
p239
aVIt means that their children's development
p240
aVcan be compromised.
p241
aVAnd the world's attention on this over the last decade
p242
aVhas reduced the problem
p243
aVfor these women,
p244
aVnot by changing the pyramid,
p245
aVbut by changing what they particularly eat out of it.
p246
aVWe've taken them out of their natural pyramid
p247
aVin order to solve this problem.
p248
aVThat's a good thing for this particular acute problem,
p249
aVbut it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.
p250
aa(lp251
VThere's other ways of breaking the pyramid.
p252
aVThe pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom,
p253
aVcan get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.
p254
aVAnd if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer
p255
aVin the base of that food pyramid,
p256
aVit can back up all through it.
p257
aVWe end up with things we've heard about before:
p258
aVred tides, for example,
p259
aVwhich are blooms of toxic algae
p260
aVfloating through the oceans
p261
aVcausing neurological damage.
p262
aVWe can also see blooms of bacteria,
p263
aVblooms of viruses in the ocean.
p264
aVThese are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here
p265
aVand a bacteria
p266
aVin the genus vibrio,
p267
aVwhich includes the genus that has cholera in it.
p268
aVHow many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?
p269
aVWhy does that happen?
p270
aVIt happens because we have jammed so much
p271
aVinto the base of the natural ocean pyramid
p272
aVthat these bacteria clog it up
p273
aVand overfill onto our beaches.
p274
aVOften what jams us up is sewage.
p275
aa(lp276
VNow how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park
p277
aVwhere you had a big sign at the front saying,
p278
aV"Closed because human sewage
p279
aVis so far over this park
p280
aVthat you can't use it"?
p281
aVNot very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.
p282
aVWe wouldn't tolerate our parks
p283
aVbeing swamped by human sewage,
p284
aVbut beaches are closed a lot in our country.
p285
aVThey're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason,
p286
aVand I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.
p287
aVIt's not just a question of cleanliness;
p288
aVit's also a question of
p289
aVhow those organisms
p290
aVthen turn into human disease.
p291
aVThese vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.
p292
aVThey can go into your skin and create skin infections.
p293
aa(lp294
VThis is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative,
p295
aVshowing the rise of the infections
p296
aVby vibrio in people
p297
aVover the last few years.
p298
aVSurfers, for example, know this incredibly.
p299
aVAnd if you can see on some surfing sites,
p300
aVin fact, not only do you see
p301
aVwhat the waves are like or what the weather's like,
p302
aVbut on some surf rider sites,
p303
aVyou see a little flashing poo alert.
p304
aVThat means that the beach might have great waves,
p305
aVbut it's a dangerous place for surfers to be
p306
aVbecause they can carry with them,
p307
aVeven after a great day of surfing,
p308
aVthis legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.
p309
aVSome of these infections are actually carrying
p310
aVantibiotic resistance genes now,
p311
aVand that makes them even more difficult.
p312
aa(lp313
VThese same infections
p314
aVcreate harmful algal blooms.
p315
aVThose blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.
p316
aVThis is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons
p317
aVthat come out of these harmful algal blooms:
p318
aVshellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera,
p319
aVdiarrheic shellfish poisoning \u2014 you don't want to know about that \u2014
p320
aVneurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.
p321
aVThese are things that are getting into our food chain
p322
aVbecause of these blooms.
p323
aVRita Calwell very famously
p324
aVtraced a very interesting story
p325
aVof cholera into human communities,
p326
aVbrought there, not by
p327
aVa normal human vector,
p328
aVbut by a marine vector, this copepod.
p329
aVCopepods are small crustaceans.
p330
aVThey're a tiny fraction of an inch long,
p331
aVand they can carry on their little legs
p332
aVsome of the cholera bacteria
p333
aVthat then leads to human disease.
p334
aVThat has sparked cholera epidemics
p335
aVin ports along the world
p336
aVand has led to increased concentration
p337
aVon trying to make sure shipping
p338
aVdoesn't move these
p339
aVvectors of cholera around the world.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo what do you do?
p342
aVWe have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow
p343
aVthat the pyramid may not be working so well,
p344
aVthat the flow from the base up into it
p345
aVis being blocked and clogged.
p346
aVWhat do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?
p347
aVWell, there's a bunch of things you could do.
p348
aVYou could call Joe the Plumber, for example.
p349
aVAnd he could come in
p350
aVand fix the flow.
p351
aVBut in fact, if you look around the world,
p352
aVnot only are there hope spots
p353
aVfor where we may be able to fix problems,
p354
aVthere have been places where problems have been fixed,
p355
aVwhere people have come to grips with these issues
p356
aVand begun to turn them around.
p357
aVMonterey is one of those.
p358
aa(lp359
VI started out showing how much
p360
aVwe had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem
p361
aVwith pollution and the canning industry
p362
aVand all of the attendant problems.
p363
aVIn 1932, that's the picture.
p364
aVIn 2009, the picture is dramatically different.
p365
aVThe canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.
p366
aVBut there's a greater sense here
p367
aVthat what the individual communities need
p368
aVis working ecosystems.
p369
aVThey need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.
p370
aVAnd that pyramid
p371
aVin Monterey, right now,
p372
aVbecause of the efforts of a lot of different people,
p373
aVis functioning better than it's ever functioned
p374
aVfor the last 150 years.
p375
aa(lp376
VIt didn't happen accidentally.
p377
aVIt happened because many people put their time and effort
p378
aVand their pioneering spirit into this.
p379
aVOn the left there, Julia Platt,
p380
aVthe mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove.
p381
aVAt 74 years old, became mayor
p382
aVbecause something had to be done
p383
aVto protect the ocean.
p384
aVIn 1931, she produced California's first
p385
aVcommunity-based marine protected area,
p386
aVright next to the biggest polluting cannery,
p387
aVbecause Julia knew
p388
aVthat when the canneries eventually were gone,
p389
aVthe ocean needed a place to grow from,
p390
aVthat the ocean needed a place to spark a seed,
p391
aVand she wanted to provide that seed.
p392
aa(lp393
VOther people, like David Packard and Julie Packard,
p394
aVwho were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium
p395
aVto lock into people's notion
p396
aVthat the ocean
p397
aVand the health of the ocean ecosystem
p398
aVwere just as important to the economy of this area
p399
aVas eating the ecosystem would be.
p400
aVThat change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift,
p401
aVnot only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay,
p402
aVbut other places around the world.
p403
aa(lp404
VWell, I want to leave you with the thought that
p405
aVwhat we're really trying to do here
p406
aVis protect this ocean pyramid,
p407
aVand that ocean pyramid
p408
aVconnects to our own pyramid of life.
p409
aVIt's an ocean planet,
p410
aVand we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species,
p411
aVbut the pyramid of life in the ocean
p412
aVand our own lives on land
p413
aVare intricately connected.
p414
aVAnd it's only through having the ocean being healthy
p415
aVthat we can remain healthy ourselves.
p416
aa(lp417
VThank you very much.

VI am known best for human-powered flight,
p5
aVbut that was just one thing that got me going
p6
aVin the sort of things that I'm working in now.
p7
aVAs a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes,
p8
aVornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders, power planes,
p9
aVindoor models, outdoor models, everything,
p10
aVwhich I just thought was a lot of fun,
p11
aVand wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them.
p12
aVAnd then, navy pilot training, and, after college,
p13
aVI got into sailplane flying, power plane flying,
p14
aVand considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun,
p15
aVbut got tangled up with some great professor types,
p16
aVwho convinced me and everybody else in the field
p17
aVthat this was a good way to get into really deep science.
p18
aa(lp19
VWhile this was all going on, I was in the field of weather modification,
p20
aValthough getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics.
p21
aVThe weather modification subject was getting started,
p22
aVand as a graduate student,
p23
aVI could go around to the various talks that were being given,
p24
aVon a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast,
p25
aVand so on. And everybody would talk to me,
p26
aVbut all the professionals in the field hated each other,
p27
aVand they wouldn't communicate. And as a result,
p28
aVI got the absolutely unique background in that field,
p29
aVand started a company, which did more research
p30
aVin weather modification than anybody,
p31
aVand there are a lot of things that I just can't go into.
p32
aVBut then, 1971 started AeroVironment, with no employees \u2014
p33
aVthen one or two, three,
p34
aVand sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects.
p35
aVWe had AirDynamisis,
p36
aVwho, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies
p37
aVon some big, many year project,
p38
aVand so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew.
p39
aa(lp40
VThe thing that is exciting was, in 1976,
p41
aVI suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane
p42
aVbecause I'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars,
p43
aVor I guaranteed the money at the bank.
p44
aVHe needed them \u2014 he needed the money for starting a company.
p45
aVThe company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back,
p46
aVand I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt,
p47
aVand I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight,
p48
aVwhich had then been around for \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p49
aV17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds,
p50
aVwhich, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight \u2014
p53
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p54
aVand did not \u2014 the way I approached it, first,
p55
aVthinking about ways to make the planes,
p56
aVwas just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding,
p57
aVand I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.
p58
aVBut then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight,
p59
aVjust for the fun of it,
p60
aVand you can watch a bird soaring around in circles,
p61
aVand measure the time, and estimate the bank angle,
p62
aVand immediately, figure out its speed,
p63
aVand the turning radius, and so on,
p64
aVwhich I could do in the car, as we're driving along on a vacation trip \u2014
p65
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p66
aVwith my three sons, young sons, helping me,
p67
aVbut ridiculing the whole thing very much.
p68
aa(lp69
VBut that began thinking about how birds went around,
p70
aVand then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly,
p71
aVand then other planes,
p72
aVand the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged,
p73
aVwas so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place,
p74
aVbut one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down \u2014
p75
aV70 pounds was all it weighed \u2014 but let the size swell up, like a hang glider,
p76
aVbut three times the span, three times the cord.
p77
aVYou're down to a third of the speed, a third of the power,
p78
aVand a good bicyclist can put out that power, and that worked,
p79
aVand we won the prize a year later.
p80
aa(lp81
VWe didn't \u2014 a lot of flying, a lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn't work,
p82
aVand ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better.
p83
aVGot a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it,
p84
aVand finally, succeeded. But unfortunately,
p85
aVabout 65,000 dollars was spent on the project.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd there was only about 30 to help retire the debt.
p90
aVBut fortunately, Henry Kramer, who put up the prize for \u2014
p91
aVthat was a one-mile flight \u2014 put up a new prize
p92
aVfor flying the English Channel, 21 miles.
p93
aVAnd he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that.
p94
aVWe realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit,
p95
aVthe power to fly would be decreased a little bit,
p96
aVand if you decrease the power required a little,
p97
aVthe pilot can fly a much longer period of time.
p98
aVAnd Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight,
p99
aVto get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel,
p100
aVand we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.
p101
aVAnd when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled, and everything was fine.
p102
aVIt turned out that giving the planes to the museum
p103
aVwas worth much more than the debt,
p104
aVso for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.
p105
aVSo, there were good economic reasons for the project, but \u2014
p106
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p107
aa(lp108
Vthat's not, well, the project was done entirely for economic reasons,
p109
aVand we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then \u2014
p110
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p111
aVbecause the prizes are all over.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVBut that sure started me thinking about various things,
p114
aVand immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane
p115
aVbecause we felt solar power was going to be so important
p116
aVfor the country and the world,
p117
aVwe didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased,
p118
aVwhich is what the government was trying to do with it.
p119
aVAnd we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense,
p120
aVbut you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power
p121
aVand maybe help that field.
p122
aVAnd that project continued, did succeed,
p123
aVand we then got into other projects in aviation
p124
aVand mechanical things and ground devices.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut while this was going on,
p127
aVin 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation \u2014
p128
aVtheir annual prize \u2014
p129
aVand I had to prepare a paper on it,
p130
aVwhich collected all my varied thoughts
p131
aVand varied interests over the years.
p132
aVThis was the one chance that I had to focus on what I, really, was after,
p133
aVand what was important. And to my surprise,
p134
aVI realized the importance of environmental issues,
p135
aVwhich Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to,
p136
aVand preparing that paper did me a lot of good.
p137
aVI thought back about if I was a space traveler,
p138
aVand came and visited Earth every 5,000 years.
p139
aVAnd for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time,
p140
aVthe little differences in the Earth.
p141
aa(lp142
VBut this last time, just coming round, right now,
p143
aVsuddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment,
p144
aVin the concentration of people,
p145
aVand it was just unbelievable, the amount of \u2014 all the change in it.
p146
aVI wanted to \u2014 well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago,
p147
aVwe began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution,
p148
aVand 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground,
p149
aVwith a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production,
p150
aVwill reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down,
p151
aVand we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.
p152
aa(lp153
VI wanted to show the slide \u2014
p154
aVthis slide, I think, is the most important one any of you will see, ever, because \u2014
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aV(Applause) \u2014
p157
aVit shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.
p158
aVAnd so, the year 2000, you see there.
p159
aVAnd this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates.
p160
aVHumans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on, are \u2014
p161
aVthe red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion.
p162
aVThe green line goes down. That's the wild nature portion.
p163
aVHumans, livestock and pets are, now, 98 percent of the total world's mass
p164
aVof vertebrates on land and air.
p165
aVAnd you don't know what the future will hold,
p166
aVbut it's not going to get a lower percentage.
p167
aVTen thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets
p168
aVwere not even one tenth of one percent
p169
aVand wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve.
p170
aVNow they are 98 percent, and it, I think, shows human domination of the Earth.
p171
aa(lp172
VI give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer,
p173
aVand ask them, after they've asked me questions,
p174
aVand I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions.
p175
aVWhat's the population of the Earth?
p176
aVWhat's the population of the Earth going to be
p177
aVwhen you're the age of your parents?
p178
aVWhich I'd never, really \u2014 they had never, really, thought about
p179
aVbut, now, they think about it.
p180
aVAnd then, what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium
p181
aVthat could continue on, and be for 2050, 2100, 2150?
p182
aVAnd they form little groups, all fighting with each other,
p183
aVand when I leave, two hours later,
p184
aVmost of them are saying about 2 billion people,
p185
aVand they don't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion,
p186
aVnor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem.
p187
aa(lp188
VRachel Carson was thinking of these, and came out with "Silent Spring," way back.
p189
aV"Solar Manifesto" by Hermann Scheer, in Germany,
p190
aVclaims all energy on Earth can be derived, for every country,
p191
aVfrom solar energy and water, and so on.
p192
aVYou don't need to dig down for these chemicals,
p193
aVand we can do things much more efficiently.
p194
aVLet's have the next slide.
p195
aVSo this just summarizes it. "Over billions of years,
p196
aVon a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life \u2014
p197
aVcomplex and probable, wonderful and fragile.
p198
aa(lp199
VSuddenly, we humans, a recently arrived species,
p200
aVno longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature,
p201
aVhave grown in population, technology and intelligence
p202
aVto a position of terrible power. We, now, wield the paintbrush."
p203
aVWe're in charge. It's frightening.
p204
aVAnd I do a painting every 20 or 25 years. This is the last one.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVAnd [it] shows the Earth in a time flag: on the right,
p207
aVin trilobites and dinosaurs and so on;
p208
aVand over the triangle, we now get to civilization and TV
p209
aVand traffic jams and so on.
p210
aVI have no idea of what comes next,
p211
aVso I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future,
p212
aVas a little warning.
p213
aVAnd two weeks after this drawing was done,
p214
aVwe actually had our first project contract, at AeroVironment,
p215
aVon robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aV(Paper rustling)
p219
aa(lp220
VWell, that'll be all the slides.
p221
aVAs time went on, we stopped our environmental programs.
p222
aVWe focused more on the really serious energy problems
p223
aVof the future, and we produced products for the company.
p224
aVAnd we developed the impact car that General Motors made,
p225
aVthe EV1, out of \u2014
p226
aVand got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations
p227
aVthat stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart.
p228
aVAnd we've done a lot of things, small drone airplanes and so on.
p229
aVI have a Helios. We have the first video.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Video) Narrator: With a wingspan of 247 feet, this makes her larger than a Boeing 747.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Music)
p234
aa(lp235
VHer designers' attention to detail and her construction
p236
aVgives Helios' structure the flexibility and strength
p237
aVto deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere.
p238
aVThis enables her to easily ride through the air currents
p239
aVas if she's sliding along on the ocean waves.
p240
aa(lp241
VPaul MacCready: The wings could touch together on top and not break. We think.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VNarrator: And Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun,
p246
aVto maximize the power from her solar array.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Music)
p249
aVAs the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures drop
p250
aVbelow minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit,
p251
aVthe most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey
p252
aVhas gone by without notice,
p253
aVexcept for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems
p254
aVand their associated sensors.
p255
aVApproaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet,
p256
aVat 4:12 p.m., Helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.
p257
aVThis is more than 10,000 feet higher
p258
aVthan the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VPM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications,
p263
aVand it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.
p264
aVEventually, it will be able to have to stay up day, night, day, night,
p265
aVfor six months at a time, acting like the synchronous satellite,
p266
aVbut only ten miles above the Earth.
p267
aVLet's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Video) Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance.
p270
aVIn effect a pair of roving eyeglasses,
p271
aVa cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead
p272
aVif the operator is remote from the vehicle.
p273
aVIt is convenient to carry, assemble, and launch by hand.
p274
aVBattery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
p275
aVIt sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
p276
aVWith on-board GPS, it can navigate autonomously,
p277
aVand it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.
p278
aa(lp279
VPM: Okay, and let's have the next.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Applause)
p282
aa(lp283
VThat plane is widely used by the military, now, in all their operations.
p284
aVLet's have the next video.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Video) (Music)
p287
aa(lp288
VAlan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Music)
p291
aa(lp292
VWe're going to end our visit with Paul MacCready's flying circus
p293
aVby meeting his son, Tyler, who, with his two brothers,
p294
aVhelped build the Gossamer Condor, 25 years ago.
p295
aa(lp296
VTyler MacCready: You can chase it, like this, for hours.
p297
aa(lp298
VAA: When they got bored with their father's project,
p299
aVthey invented an extraordinary little plane of their own.
p300
aa(lp301
VTM: And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing, or on the other.
p302
aa(lp303
VAA: They called it their Walkalong Glider.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Music)
p306
aa(lp307
VI've never seen anything like that.
p308
aVHow old were you when you invented that?
p309
aa(lp310
VTM: Oh, 10, 11. (AA: Oh my God.)
p311
aa(lp312
VTM: 12, something like that. (AA: That's amazing.)
p313
aa(lp314
VPM: And Tyler's here to show you the Walkalong.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Applause)
p317
aa(lp318
VTM: All right. You all got a couple of these in your gift bags,
p319
aVand one of the first things,
p320
aVthe production version seemed to dive a little bit,
p321
aVand so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit
p322
aVbefore you try flying it.
p323
aVI'll give you a demonstration of how it works.
p324
aVThe idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff.
p325
aVAs the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, so
p326
aVas you walk through the air, it goes around your body, some has to go over you.
p327
aVAnd so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.
p328
aVThe launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head,
p329
aVand you start walking forward, and just let go of it, and you can control it like that.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd then also, like it said in the video,
p334
aVyou can turn it left or right
p335
aVjust by putting the lift under one wing or another.
p336
aVSo I can do it \u2014 oops, that was going to be a right turn.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VOkay, this one will be a left turn.
p341
aVHere, but \u2014
p342
aV(Applause) \u2014
p343
aVanyway.
p344
aV(Applause)
p345
aVAnd that's it, so you can just control it, wherever you want,
p346
aVand it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production,
p347
aVso you have real collector's items.
p348
aa(lp349
V(Laughter)
p350
aa(lp351
VAnd this, we just wanted to show you \u2014
p352
aVif we can get the video running on this, yeah \u2014
p353
aVjust an example of a little video surveillance.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VThis was flying around in the party last night, and \u2014
p358
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p359
aVyou can see how it just can fly around,
p360
aVand you can spy on anybody you want.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd that's it. I was going to bring an airplane,
p365
aVbut I was worried about hitting people in here,
p366
aVso I thought this would be a little bit more gentle.
p367
aVAnd that's it, yeah, just a few inventions.
p368
aV(Applause)
p369
aVAll right.

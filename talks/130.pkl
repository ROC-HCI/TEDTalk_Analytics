VThank you.
p5
aVAnd I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me.
p6
aVI feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra,
p7
aVan ancient work from ancient India
p8
aVin which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people
p9
aVcome to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali,
p10
aVand they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him.
p11
aVAll the young people, actually, from the city.
p12
aVThe old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha,
p13
aVbecause when he came to their city he accepted \u2014
p14
aVhe always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is,
p15
aVand the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person,
p16
aVraced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling:
p19
aV"He's supposed to be religious and all this.
p20
aVWhat's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,"
p21
aVand so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him.
p22
aVThey wouldn't go listen to him.
p23
aVBut the young people all came.
p24
aVAnd they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground.
p25
aVAnd as soon as they had laid all these,
p26
aVall their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India,
p27
aVhe performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium,
p28
aVthe wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there
p29
aVthe total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets
p32
aVwith human life on it,
p33
aVand enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets.
p34
aVSo they don't \u2014 when they look out and they see those lights that you showed
p35
aVin the sky \u2014 they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning
p36
aVor rocks or flames or gases exploding.
p37
aVThey actually see landscapes and human beings
p38
aVand gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.
p39
aa(lp40
VHe made that special effect at the beginning
p41
aVto get everyone to think about interconnection
p42
aVand interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.
p43
aVAnd then Leilei \u2014 I know his other name \u2014 told us about interconnection,
p44
aVand how we're all totally interconnected here,
p45
aVand how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe,
p46
aVwe've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past.
p47
aVAnd I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth.
p48
aVAnd we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters,
p49
aVif that's a modern form of enlightenment.
p50
aVI guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness
p51
aVof all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness,
p52
aVof where everybody can really know everything
p53
aVthat's going on everywhere in the planet.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd therefore it will become intolerable \u2014
p56
aVwhat compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us,
p57
aVtotally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying
p58
aVthe life of the mind or whatever it is,
p59
aVand there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease
p60
aVand they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place,
p61
aVor they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.
p62
aVIt just becomes intolerable.
p63
aVWith all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology
p64
aVto become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do.
p67
aVBecause we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do,
p68
aVa little bit tired, we do suffer.
p69
aVWe do enjoy our misery in a certain way.
p70
aVWe distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere,
p71
aVbut basically we all have this common misery
p72
aVthat we are sort of stuck inside our skins
p73
aVand everyone else is out there.
p74
aVAnd occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin
p75
aVand the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own,
p76
aVand ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.
p77
aa(lp78
VBecause our egocentric perception \u2014 from the Buddha's point of view, misperception \u2014
p79
aVis that all we are is what is inside our skin.
p80
aVAnd it's inside and outside, self and other,
p81
aVand other is all very different.
p82
aVAnd everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,
p83
aVa little bit, right?
p84
aVYou know, someone sitting next to you in a seat \u2014 that's OK because you're in a theater,
p85
aVbut if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,
p86
aVyou'd freak out.
p87
aVWhat do they want from me? Like, who's that?
p88
aVAnd so you wouldn't sit that close to another person
p89
aVbecause of your notion that it's you versus the universe \u2014 that's all Buddha discovered.
p90
aVBecause that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us,
p91
aVand everyone else is different,
p92
aVthen that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it?
p93
aVWho is it who's going to get enough attention from the world?
p94
aVWho's going to get enough out of the world?
p95
aVWho's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings \u2014
p96
aVif you're different from all the other beings?
p97
aa(lp98
VSo where compassion comes is where you
p99
aVsurprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way:
p100
aVthrough art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually,
p101
aVknowing that you have no such boundary,
p102
aVknowing your interconnectedness with other beings.
p103
aVYou can experience yourself as the other beings
p104
aVwhen you see through the delusion of being separated from them.
p105
aVWhen you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel.
p106
aVLuckily, they say \u2014 I still am not sure \u2014
p107
aVbut luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said
p108
aVin the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate?
p109
aVHow awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.
p110
aVMy bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.
p111
aVI never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.
p112
aVI need a hundred billion." So I'm like that.
p113
aVImagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.
p114
aVIt would be terrible.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut apparently, this is a strange paradox of life.
p117
aVWhen you're no longer locked in yourself,
p118
aVand as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge
p119
aVof the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out,
p120
aVand empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing,
p121
aVand realizing that you are the other being,
p122
aVsomehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,
p123
aVyou get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,
p124
aVlike the Beatles used to sing.
p125
aa(lp126
VYou know, we really learned everything in the '60s.
p127
aVToo bad nobody ever woke up to it,
p128
aVand they've been trying to suppress it since then.
p129
aVI, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.
p130
aVBut when we're relieved from that,
p131
aVwe somehow then become interested in all the other beings.
p132
aVAnd we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.
p133
aVIt's totally strange.
p134
aVThe Dalai Lama always likes to say \u2014
p135
aVhe says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,
p136
aVit's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures
p137
aVare finally too small a theater for your intelligence.
p138
aVIt's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know \u2014
p139
aVand the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.
p140
aVLike, even when you're having a good time,
p141
aVwhen is the good time over?
p142
aVThe good time is over when you think, how good is it?
p143
aVAnd then it's never good enough.
p144
aa(lp145
VI love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly
p146
aVon the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time,
p147
aVdoing it by having a good time.
p148
aVI think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that.
p149
aVHe once told me \u2014 he looked kind of sad;
p150
aVhe worries very much about the haves and have-nots.
p151
aVHe looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,
p152
aVthey went and took everything away from the haves.
p153
aVYou know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.
p154
aVThey took it all away by violence,
p155
aVsaying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.
p156
aVThey didn't help at all.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?
p159
aVAnd so then he looks at me.
p160
aVSo I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,"
p161
aVwas all I could think of. What is virtue?
p162
aVBut of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion
p163
aVis that it is more fun.
p164
aVIt should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.
p165
aVEverybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring,
p166
aVand they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly.
p167
aVEven though his people are being genocided \u2014
p168
aVand believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head,
p169
aVin every Chinese prison. He feels it.
p170
aVHe feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.
p171
aVI won't even say what they do. But he feels it.
p172
aVAnd yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.
p173
aa(lp174
VBecause when you open up like that,
p175
aVthen you can't just \u2014 what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?
p176
aVYou have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is,
p177
aVhow it can be changed.
p178
aVLook at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man.
p179
aVShe scared us with the lava man is coming,
p180
aVthen the tsunami is coming,
p181
aVbut then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.
p182
aVIt's really lovely.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo, compassion means to feel the feelings of others,
p185
aVand the human being actually is compassion.
p186
aVThe human being is almost out of time.
p187
aVThe human being is compassion because what is our brain for?
p188
aVNow, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac.
p189
aVBut he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.
p190
aVHe could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings.
p191
aVAnd he would have tremendous fun doing that.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo the first person who gets happy,
p194
aVwhen you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I,
p195
aVwhere you're always dissatisfied \u2014
p196
aVas Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way.
p197
aVSo then you decide, "Well, I'm sick of myself.
p198
aVI'm going to think of how other people can be happy.
p199
aVI'm going to get up in the morning and think,
p200
aVwhat can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat,
p201
aVmy pet, my butterfly?"
p202
aVAnd the first person who gets happy when you do that,
p203
aVyou don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself,
p204
aVbecause your whole perception broadens
p205
aVand you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.
p206
aVAnd you realize that this \u2014 being with these people \u2014
p207
aVis the flower garden that Chiho showed us.
p208
aVIt is Nirvana.
p209
aVAnd my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.
p210
aVThank you.

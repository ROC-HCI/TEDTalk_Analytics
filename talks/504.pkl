VI thought I'd begin with a scene of war.
p5
aVThere was little to warn of the danger ahead.
p6
aVThe Iraqi insurgent had placed the IED,
p7
aVan Improvised Explosive Device,
p8
aValong the side of the road with great care.
p9
aVBy 2006, there were more than 2,500
p10
aVof these attacks every single month,
p11
aVand they were the leading cause of
p12
aVcasualties among American soldiers
p13
aVand Iraqi civilians.
p14
aVThe team that was hunting for this IED
p15
aVis called an EOD team\u2014
p16
aVExplosives Ordinance Disposal\u2014and
p17
aVthey're the pointy end of the spear in the
p18
aVAmerican effort to suppress these roadside bombs.
p19
aVEach EOD team goes out on about
p20
aV600 of these bomb calls every year,
p21
aVdefusing about two bombs a day.
p22
aVPerhaps the best sign of how valuable they
p23
aVare to the war effort, is that
p24
aVthe Iraqi insurgents put a $50,000 bounty
p25
aVon the head of a single EOD soldier.
p26
aa(lp27
VUnfortunately, this particular call
p28
aVwould not end well.
p29
aVBy the time the soldier advanced close
p30
aVenough to see the telltale wires
p31
aVof the bomb, it exploded in a wave of flame.
p32
aVNow, depending how close you are
p33
aVand how much explosive has been packed
p34
aVinto that bomb, it can cause death
p35
aVor injury. You have to be as far as
p36
aV50 yards away to escape that.
p37
aVThe blast is so strong it can even break
p38
aVyour limbs, even if you're not hit.
p39
aVThat soldier had been on top of the bomb.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd so when the rest of the team advanced
p42
aVthey found little left. And that night the unit's
p43
aVcommander did a sad duty, and he wrote
p44
aVa condolence letter back to the United
p45
aVStates, and he talked about how hard the
p46
aVloss had been on his unit, about the fact
p47
aVthat they had lost their bravest soldier,
p48
aVa soldier who had saved their lives
p49
aVmany a time.
p50
aVAnd he apologized
p51
aVfor not being able to bring them home.
p52
aVBut then he talked up the silver lining
p53
aVthat he took away from the loss.
p54
aV"At least," as he wrote, "when a robot dies,
p55
aVyou don't have to write a letter
p56
aVto its mother."
p57
aa(lp58
VThat scene sounds like science fiction,
p59
aVbut is battlefield reality already.
p60
aVThe soldier in that case
p61
aVwas a 42-pound robot called a PackBot.
p62
aVThe chief's letter went, not to some
p63
aVfarmhouse in Iowa like you see
p64
aVin the old war movies, but went to
p65
aVthe iRobot Company, which is
p66
aVnamed after the Asimov novel
p67
aVand the not-so-great Will Smith movie,
p68
aVand... um... (Laughter)...
p69
aVif you remember that
p70
aVin that fictional world, robots started out
p71
aVcarrying out mundane chores, and then
p72
aVthey started taking on life-and-death decisions.
p73
aVThat's a reality we face today.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhat we're going to do is actually just
p76
aVflash a series of photos behind me that
p77
aVshow you the reality of robots used in war
p78
aVright now or already at the prototype stage.
p79
aVIt's just to give you a taste.
p80
aVAnother way of putting it is you're not
p81
aVgoing to see anything that's powered
p82
aVby Vulcan technology, or teenage
p83
aVwizard hormones or anything like that.
p84
aVThis is all real. So why don't we
p85
aVgo ahead and start those pictures.
p86
aa(lp87
VSomething big is going on in war today,
p88
aVand maybe even the history of humanity
p89
aVitself. The U.S. military went into Iraq with
p90
aVa handful of drones in the air.
p91
aVWe now have 5,300.
p92
aVWe went in with zero unmanned ground
p93
aVsystems. We now have 12,000.
p94
aVAnd the tech term "killer application"
p95
aVtakes on new meaning in this space.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd we need to remember that we're
p98
aVtalking about the Model T Fords,
p99
aVthe Wright Flyers, compared
p100
aVto what's coming soon.
p101
aVThat's where we're at right now.
p102
aVOne of the people that I recently met with
p103
aVwas an Air Force three-star general, and he
p104
aVsaid basically, where we're headed very
p105
aVsoon is tens of thousands of robots
p106
aVoperating in our conflicts, and these
p107
aVnumbers matter, because we're not just
p108
aVtalking about tens of thousands of today's
p109
aVrobots, but tens of thousands of these
p110
aVprototypes and tomorrow's robots, because
p111
aVof course, one of the things that's operating
p112
aVin technology is Moore's Law,
p113
aVthat you can pack in more and more
p114
aVcomputing power into those robots, and so
p115
aVflash forward around 25 years,
p116
aVif Moore's Law holds true,
p117
aVthose robots will be close to a billion times
p118
aVmore powerful in their computing than today.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd so what that means is the kind of
p121
aVthings that we used to only talk about at
p122
aVscience fiction conventions like Comic-Con
p123
aVhave to be talked about in the halls
p124
aVof power and places like the Pentagon.
p125
aVA robots revolution is upon us.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow, I need to be clear here.
p128
aVI'm not talking about a revolution where you
p129
aVhave to worry about the Governor of
p130
aVCalifornia showing up at your door,
p131
aVa la the Terminator. (Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VWhen historians look at this period, they're
p134
aVgoing to conclude that we're in a different
p135
aVtype of revolution: a revolution in war,
p136
aVlike the invention of the atomic bomb.
p137
aVBut it may be even bigger than that,
p138
aVbecause our unmanned systems don't just
p139
aa(lp140
Vaffect the "how" of war-fighting,
p141
aVthey affect the "who" of fighting
p142
aVat its most fundamental level.
p143
aVThat is, every previous revolution in war, be
p144
aVit the machine gun, be it the atomic bomb,
p145
aVwas about a system that either shot faster,
p146
aVwent further, had a bigger boom.
p147
aVThat's certainly the case with robotics, but
p148
aVthey also change the experience of the warrior
p149
aVand even the very identity of the warrior.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnother way of putting this is that
p152
aVmankind's 5,000-year-old monopoly
p153
aVon the fighting of war is breaking down
p154
aVin our very lifetime. I've spent
p155
aVthe last several years going around
p156
aVmeeting with all the players in this field,
p157
aVfrom the robot scientists to the science
p158
aVfiction authors who inspired them to the
p159
aV19-year-old drone pilots who are fighting
p160
aVfrom Nevada, to the four-star generals
p161
aVwho command them, to even the Iraqi
p162
aVinsurgents who they are targeting and what
p163
aVthey think about our systems, and
p164
aVwhat I found interesting is not just
p165
aVtheir stories, but how their experiences
p166
aVpoint to these ripple effects that are going
p167
aVoutwards in our society, in our law
p168
aVand our ethics, etc. And so what I'd like
p169
aVto do with my remaining time is basically
p170
aVflesh out a couple of these.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo the first is that the future of war,
p173
aVeven a robotics one, is not going to be
p174
aVpurely an American one.
p175
aVThe U.S. is currently ahead in military
p176
aVrobotics right now, but we know that in
p177
aVtechnology there's no such thing as
p178
aVa permanent first move or advantage.
p179
aVIn a quick show of hands, how many
p180
aVpeople in this room still use
p181
aVWang Computers? (Laughter)
p182
aVIt's the same thing in war. The British and
p183
aVthe French invented the tank.
p184
aVThe Germans figured out how
p185
aVto use it right, and so what we have to
p186
aVthink about for the U.S. is that we are
p187
aVahead right now, but you have
p188
aV43 other countries out there
p189
aVworking on military robotics, and they
p190
aVinclude all the interesting countries like
p191
aVRussia, China, Pakistan, Iran.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd this raises a bigger worry for me.
p194
aVHow do we move forward in this revolution
p195
aVgiven the state of our manufacturing
p196
aVand the state of our science and
p197
aVmathematics training in our schools?
p198
aVOr another way of thinking about this is,
p199
aVwhat does it mean to go to war increasingly
p200
aVwith soldiers whose hardware is made
p201
aVin China and software is written in India?
p202
aa(lp203
VBut just as software has gone open-source,
p204
aVso has warfare.
p205
aVUnlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb,
p206
aVyou don't need a massive manufacturing
p207
aVsystem to build robotics. A lot of it is
p208
aVoff the shelf. A lot of it's even do-it-yourself.
p209
aVOne of those things you just saw flashed
p210
aVbefore you was a raven drone, the handheld
p211
aVtossed one. For about a thousand dollars,
p212
aVyou can build one yourself, equivalent to
p213
aVwhat the soldiers use in Iraq.
p214
aa(lp215
VThat raises another wrinkle when it comes
p216
aVto war and conflict. Good guys might play
p217
aVaround and work on these as hobby kits,
p218
aVbut so might bad guys.
p219
aVThis cross between robotics and things like
p220
aVterrorism is going to be fascinating
p221
aVand even disturbing,
p222
aVand we've already seen it start.
p223
aa(lp224
VDuring the war between Israel, a state,
p225
aVand Hezbollah, a non-state actor,
p226
aVthe non-state actor flew
p227
aVfour different drones against Israel.
p228
aVThere's already a jihadi website
p229
aVthat you can go on and remotely
p230
aVdetonate an IED in Iraq while sitting
p231
aVat your home computer.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd so I think what we're going to see is
p234
aVtwo trends take place with this.
p235
aVFirst is, you're going to reinforce the power
p236
aVof individuals against governments,
p237
aVbut then the second is that
p238
aVwe are going to see an expansion
p239
aVin the realm of terrorism.
p240
aVThe future of it may be a cross between
p241
aVal Qaeda 2.0 and the
p242
aVnext generation of the Unabomber.
p243
aVAnd another way of thinking about this
p244
aVis the fact that, remember, you don't have
p245
aVto convince a robot that they're gonna
p246
aVreceive 72 virgins after they die
p247
aVto convince them to blow themselves up.
p248
aa(lp249
VBut the ripple effects of this are going to go
p250
aVout into our politics. One of the people that
p251
aVI met with was a former Assistant Secretary of
p252
aVDefense for Ronald Reagan, and he put it
p253
aVthis way: "I like these systems because
p254
aVthey save American lives, but I worry about
p255
aVmore marketization of wars,
p256
aVmore shock-and-awe talk,
p257
aVto defray discussion of the costs.
p258
aVPeople are more likely to support the use
p259
aVof force if they view it as costless."
p260
aa(lp261
VRobots for me take certain trends
p262
aVthat are already in play in our body politic,
p263
aVand maybe take them to
p264
aVtheir logical ending point.
p265
aVWe don't have a draft. We don't
p266
aVhave declarations of war anymore.
p267
aVWe don't buy war bonds anymore.
p268
aVAnd now we have the fact that we're
p269
aVconverting more and more of our American
p270
aVsoldiers that we would send into harm's
p271
aVway into machines, and so we may take
p272
aVthose already lowering bars to war
p273
aVand drop them to the ground.
p274
aa(lp275
VBut the future of war is also going to be
p276
aVa YouTube war.
p277
aVThat is, our new technologies don't merely
p278
aVremove humans from risk.
p279
aVThey also record everything that they see.
p280
aVSo they don't just delink the public:
p281
aVthey reshape its relationship with war.
p282
aVThere's already several thousand
p283
aVvideo clips of combat footage from Iraq
p284
aVon YouTube right now,
p285
aVmost of it gathered by drones.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, this could be a good thing.
p288
aVIt could be building connections between
p289
aVthe home front and the war front
p290
aVas never before.
p291
aVBut remember, this is taking place
p292
aVin our strange, weird world, and so
p293
aVinevitably the ability to download these
p294
aVvideo clips to, you know, your iPod
p295
aVor your Zune gives you
p296
aVthe ability to turn it into entertainment.
p297
aa(lp298
VSoldiers have a name for these clips.
p299
aVThey call it war porn.
p300
aVThe typical one that I was sent was
p301
aVan email that had an attachment of
p302
aVvideo of a Predator strike taking out
p303
aVan enemy site. Missile hits,
p304
aVbodies burst into the air with the explosion.
p305
aVIt was set to music.
p306
aVIt was set to the pop song
p307
aV"I Just Want To Fly" by Sugar Ray.
p308
aa(lp309
VThis ability to watch more
p310
aVbut experience less creates a wrinkle
p311
aVin the public's relationship with war.
p312
aVI think about this with a sports parallel.
p313
aVIt's like the difference between
p314
aVwatching an NBA game, a professional
p315
aVbasketball game on TV, where the athletes
p316
aVare tiny figures on the screen, and
p317
aVbeing at that basketball game in person
p318
aVand realizing what someone seven feet
p319
aVreally does look like.
p320
aa(lp321
VBut we have to remember,
p322
aVthese are just the clips.
p323
aVThese are just the ESPN SportsCenter
p324
aVversion of the game. They lose the context.
p325
aVThey lose the strategy.
p326
aVThey lose the humanity. War just
p327
aVbecomes slam dunks and smart bombs.
p328
aa(lp329
VNow the irony of all this is that
p330
aVwhile the future of war may involve
p331
aVmore and more machines,
p332
aVit's our human psychology that's driving
p333
aVall of this, it's our human failings
p334
aVthat are leading to these wars.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo one example of this that has
p337
aVbig resonance in the policy realm is
p338
aVhow this plays out on our very real
p339
aVwar of ideas that we're fighting
p340
aVagainst radical groups.
p341
aVWhat is the message that we think we are
p342
aVsending with these machines versus what
p343
aVis being received in terms of the message.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo one of the people that I met was
p346
aVa senior Bush Administration official,
p347
aVwho had this to say about
p348
aVour unmanning of war:
p349
aV"It plays to our strength. The thing that
p350
aVscares people is our technology."
p351
aVBut when you go out and meet with people,
p352
aVfor example in Lebanon, it's a very
p353
aVdifferent story. One of the people
p354
aVI met with there was a news editor, and
p355
aVwe're talking as a drone is flying above him,
p356
aVand this is what he had to say.
p357
aV"This is just another sign of the coldhearted
p358
aVcruel Israelis and Americans,
p359
aVwho are cowards because
p360
aVthey send out machines to fight us.
p361
aVThey don't want to fight us like real men,
p362
aVbut they're afraid to fight,
p363
aVso we just have to kill a few of their soldiers
p364
aVto defeat them."
p365
aa(lp366
VThe future of war also is featuring
p367
aVa new type of warrior,
p368
aVand it's actually redefining the experience
p369
aVof going to war.
p370
aVYou can call this a cubicle warrior.
p371
aVThis is what one Predator drone pilot
p372
aVdescribed of his experience fighting
p373
aVin the Iraq War while never leaving Nevada.
p374
aV"You're going to war for 12 hours,
p375
aVshooting weapons at targets,
p376
aVdirecting kills on enemy combatants,
p377
aVand then you get in the car
p378
aVand you drive home and within 20 minutes,
p379
aVyou're sitting at the dinner table
p380
aVtalking to your kids about their homework."
p381
aa(lp382
VNow, the psychological balancing
p383
aVof those experiences is incredibly tough,
p384
aVand in fact those drone pilots have
p385
aVhigher rates of PTSD than many
p386
aVof the units physically in Iraq.
p387
aVBut some have worries that this
p388
aVdisconnection will lead to something else,
p389
aVthat it might make the contemplation of war
p390
aVcrimes a lot easier when you have
p391
aVthis distance. "It's like a video game,"
p392
aVis what one young pilot described to me
p393
aVof taking out enemy troops from afar.
p394
aVAs anyone who's played Grand Theft Auto
p395
aVknows, we do things in the video world
p396
aVthat we wouldn't do face to face.
p397
aa(lp398
VSo much of what you're hearing from me
p399
aVis that there's another side
p400
aVto technologic revolutions,
p401
aVand that it's shaping our present
p402
aVand maybe will shape our future of war.
p403
aVMoore's Law is operative,
p404
aVbut so's Murphy's Law.
p405
aVThe fog of war isn't being lifted.
p406
aVThe enemy has a vote.
p407
aa(lp408
VWe're gaining incredible new capabilities,
p409
aVbut we're also seeing and experiencing
p410
aVnew human dilemmas. Now,
p411
aVsometimes these are just "oops" moments,
p412
aVwhich is what the head of a robotics
p413
aVcompany described it, you just have
p414
aV"oops" moments. Well, what are
p415
aV"oops" moments with robots in war?
p416
aVWell, sometimes they're funny. Sometimes,
p417
aVthey're like that scene from the
p418
aVEddie Murphy movie "Best Defense,"
p419
aVplaying out in reality, where they tested out
p420
aVa machine gun-armed robot, and during
p421
aVthe demonstration it started spinning
p422
aVin a circle and pointed its machine gun
p423
aVat the reviewing stand of VIPs.
p424
aVFortunately the weapon wasn't loaded
p425
aVand no one was hurt, but other times
p426
aV"oops" moments are tragic,
p427
aVsuch as last year in South Africa, where
p428
aVan anti-aircraft cannon had a
p429
aV"software glitch," and actually did turn on
p430
aVand fired, and nine soldiers were killed.
p431
aa(lp432
VWe have new wrinkles in the laws of war
p433
aVand accountability. What do we do
p434
aVwith things like unmanned slaughter?
p435
aVWhat is unmanned slaughter?
p436
aVWe've already had three instances of
p437
aVPredator drone strikes where we thought
p438
aVwe got bin Laden, and it turned out
p439
aVnot to be the case.
p440
aVAnd this is where we're at right now.
p441
aVThis is not even talking about armed,
p442
aVautonomous systems
p443
aVwith full authority to use force.
p444
aVAnd do not believe that that isn't coming.
p445
aVDuring my research I came across
p446
aVfour different Pentagon projects
p447
aVon different aspects of that.
p448
aa(lp449
VAnd so you have this question:
p450
aVwhat does this lead to issues like
p451
aVwar crimes? Robots are emotionless, so
p452
aVthey don't get upset if their buddy is killed.
p453
aVThey don't commit crimes of rage
p454
aVand revenge.
p455
aVBut robots are emotionless.
p456
aVThey see an 80-year-old grandmother
p457
aVin a wheelchair the same way they see
p458
aVa T-80 tank: they're both
p459
aVjust a series of zeroes and ones.
p460
aVAnd so we have this question to figure out:
p461
aVHow do we catch up our 20th century
p462
aVlaws of war, that are so old right now
p463
aVthat they could qualify for Medicare,
p464
aVto these 21st century technologies?
p465
aa(lp466
VAnd so, in conclusion, I've talked about
p467
aVwhat seems the future of war,
p468
aVbut notice that I've only used
p469
aVreal world examples and you've only seen
p470
aVreal world pictures and videos.
p471
aVAnd so this sets a great challenge for
p472
aVall of us that we have to worry about well
p473
aVbefore you have to worry about your
p474
aVRoomba sucking the life away from you.
p475
aVAre we going to let the fact that what's
p476
aVunveiling itself right now in war
p477
aVsounds like science fiction and therefore
p478
aVkeeps us in denial?
p479
aVAre we going to face the reality
p480
aVof 21st century war?
p481
aVIs our generation going to make the same
p482
aVmistake that a past generation did
p483
aVwith atomic weaponry, and not deal with
p484
aVthe issues that surround it until
p485
aVPandora's box is already opened up?

VNow, I could be wrong on this, and
p488
aVone Pentagon robot scientist told me
p489
aVthat I was. He said, "There's no real
p490
aVsocial, ethical, moral issues when it comes
p491
aVto robots.
p492
aVThat is," he added, "unless the machine
p493
aVkills the wrong people repeatedly.
p494
aVThen it's just a product recall issue."
p495
aa(lp496
VAnd so the ending point for this is
p497
aVthat actually, we can turn to Hollywood.
p498
aVA few years ago, Hollywood gathered
p499
aVall the top characters and created
p500
aVa list of the top 100 heroes and
p501
aVtop 100 villains of all of Hollywood history,
p502
aVthe characters that represented the best
p503
aVand worst of humanity.
p504
aVOnly one character made it onto both lists:
p505
aVThe Terminator, a robot killing machine.
p506
aVAnd so that points to the fact that
p507
aVour machines can be used
p508
aVfor both good and evil, but for me
p509
aVit points to the fact that there's a duality
p510
aVof humans as well.
p511
aa(lp512
VThis week is a celebration
p513
aVof our creativity. Our creativity
p514
aVhas taken our species to the stars.
p515
aVOur creativity has created works of arts
p516
aVand literature to express our love.
p517
aVAnd now, we're using our creativity
p518
aVin a certain direction, to build fantastic
p519
aVmachines with incredible capabilities,
p520
aVmaybe even one day
p521
aVan entirely new species.
p522
aVBut one of the main reasons that we're
p523
aVdoing that is because of our drive
p524
aVto destroy each other, and so the question
p525
aVwe all should ask:
p526
aVis it our machines, or is it us
p527
aVthat's wired for war?
p528
aa(lp529
VThank you. (Applause)

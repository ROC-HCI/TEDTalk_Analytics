VClouds.
p5
aVHave you ever noticed how much people moan about them?
p6
aVThey get a bad rap.
p7
aVIf you think about it, the English language
p8
aVhas written into it negative associations towards the clouds.
p9
aVSomeone who's down or depressed,
p10
aVthey're under a cloud.
p11
aVAnd when there's bad news in store,
p12
aVthere's a cloud on the horizon.
p13
aVI saw an article the other day.
p14
aVIt was about problems with computer processing
p15
aVover the Internet.
p16
aV"A cloud over the cloud," was the headline.
p17
aVIt seems like they're everyone's default
p18
aVdoom-and-gloom metaphor.
p19
aVBut I think they're beautiful, don't you?
p20
aVIt's just that their beauty is missed
p21
aVbecause they're so omnipresent,
p22
aVso, I don't know, commonplace,
p23
aVthat people don't notice them.
p24
aVThey don't notice the beauty, but they don't even notice the clouds
p25
aVunless they get in the way of the sun.
p26
aVAnd so people think of clouds as
p27
aVthings that get in the way.
p28
aVThey think of them as the annoying, frustrating obstructions,
p29
aVand then they rush off and do some blue-sky thinking.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVBut most people, when you stop to ask them,
p32
aVwill admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds.
p33
aVIt's like a nostalgic fondness,
p34
aVand they make them think of their youth.
p35
aVWho here can't remember thinking, well,
p36
aVlooking and finding shapes in the clouds
p37
aVwhen they were kids?
p38
aVYou know, when you were masters of daydreaming?
p39
aVAristophanes, the ancient Greek playwright,
p40
aVhe described the clouds as the patron godesses
p41
aVof idle fellows
p42
aVtwo and a half thousand years ago,
p43
aVand you can see what he means.
p44
aVIt's just that these days, us adults seem reluctant
p45
aVto allow ourselves the indulgence
p46
aVof just allowing our imaginations
p47
aVto drift along in the breeze, and I think that's a pity.
p48
aVI think we should perhaps do a bit more of it.
p49
aVI think we should be a bit more willing, perhaps,
p50
aVto look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out
p51
aVfrom behind the clouds and go, "Wait a minute,
p52
aVthat's two cats dancing the salsa!"
p53
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p54
aVOr seeing the big, white, puffy one up there
p55
aVover the shopping center looks like
p56
aVthe Abominable Snowman going to rob a bank.
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aVThey're like nature's version of those inkblot images,
p59
aVyou know, that shrinks used to show their patients
p60
aVin the '60s,
p61
aVand I think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds,
p62
aVyou'll save money on psychoanalysis bills.
p63
aVLet's say you're in love. All right?
p64
aVAnd you look up and what do you see?
p65
aVRight? Or maybe the opposite.
p66
aVYou've just been dumped by your partner,
p67
aVand everywhere you look, it's kissing couples.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVPerhaps you're having a moment of existential angst.
p70
aVYou know, you're thinking about your own mortality.
p71
aVAnd there, on the horizon, it's the Grim Reaper.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVOr maybe you see a topless sunbather.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVWhat would that mean?
p76
aVWhat would that mean? I have no idea.
p77
aVBut one thing I do know is this:
p78
aVThe bad press that clouds get is totally unfair.
p79
aVI think we should stand up for them,
p80
aVwhich is why, a few years ago,
p81
aVI started the Cloud Appreciation Society.
p82
aVTens of thousands of members now
p83
aVin almost 100 countries around the world.
p84
aVAnd all these photographs that I'm showing,
p85
aVthey were sent in by members.
p86
aVAnd the society exists to remind people of this:
p87
aVClouds are not something to moan about.
p88
aVFar from it. They are, in fact,
p89
aVthe most diverse, evocative, poetic aspect of nature.
p90
aVI think, if you live with your head in the clouds
p91
aVevery now and then, it helps you keep your feet on the ground.
p92
aVAnd I want to show you why, with the help of
p93
aVsome of my favorite types of clouds.
p94
aVLet's start with this one. It's the cirrus cloud,
p95
aVnamed after the Latin for a lock of hair.
p96
aVIt's composed entirely of ice crystals
p97
aVcascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere,
p98
aVand as these ice crystals fall,
p99
aVthey pass through different layers with different winds
p100
aVand they speed up and slow down,
p101
aVgiving the cloud these brush-stroked appearances,
p102
aVthese brush-stroke forms known as fall streaks.
p103
aVAnd these winds up there can be very, very fierce.
p104
aVThey can be 200 miles an hour, 300 miles an hour.
p105
aVThese clouds are bombing along,
p106
aVbut from all the way down here,
p107
aVthey appear to be moving gracefully, slowly,
p108
aVlike most clouds.
p109
aVAnd so to tune into the clouds is to slow down,
p110
aVto calm down.
p111
aVIt's like a bit of everyday meditation.
p112
aVThose are common clouds.
p113
aVWhat about rarer ones, like the lenticularis,
p114
aVthe UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?
p115
aVThese clouds form in the region of mountains.
p116
aVWhen the wind passes, rises to pass over the mountain,
p117
aVit can take on a wave-like path in the lee of the peak,
p118
aVwith these clouds hovering at the crest
p119
aVof these invisible standing waves of air,
p120
aVthese flying saucer-like forms,
p121
aVand some of the early black-and-white UFO photos
p122
aVare in fact lenticularis clouds. It's true.
p123
aVA little rarer are the fallstreak holes. All right?
p124
aVThis is when a layer is made up of very, very cold
p125
aVwater droplets, and in one region they start to freeze,
p126
aVand this freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards
p127
aVwith the ice crystals cascading and falling down below,
p128
aVgiving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below.
p129
aVRarer still, the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz cloud.
p130
aVNot a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand.
p131
aVThis looks like a series of breaking waves,
p132
aVand it's caused by shearing winds \u2014 the wind
p133
aVabove the cloud layer and below the cloud layer
p134
aVdiffer significantly, and in the middle, in between,
p135
aVyou get this undulating of the air,
p136
aVand if the difference in those speeds is just right,
p137
aVthe tops of the undulations curl over
p138
aVin these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices.
p139
aVAll right. Those are rarer clouds than the cirrus,
p140
aVbut they're not that rare.
p141
aVIf you look up, and you pay attention to the sky,
p142
aVyou'll see them sooner or later,
p143
aVmaybe not quite as dramatic as these, but you'll see them.
p144
aVAnd you'll see them around where you live.
p145
aVClouds are the most egalitarian
p146
aVof nature's displays, because we all have a good,
p147
aVfantastic view of the sky.
p148
aVAnd these clouds, these rarer clouds,
p149
aVremind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday.
p150
aVNothing is more nourishing, more stimulating
p151
aVto an active, inquiring mind than being surprised,
p152
aVbeing amazed. It's why we're all here at TED, right?
p153
aVBut you don't need to rush off
p154
aVaway from the familiar, across the world
p155
aVto be surprised.
p156
aVYou just need to step outside,
p157
aVpay attention to what's so commonplace, so everyday,
p158
aVso mundane that everybody else misses it.
p159
aVOne cloud that people rarely miss is this one:
p160
aVthe cumulonimbus storm cloud.
p161
aVIt's what's produces thunder and lightning and hail.
p162
aVThese clouds spread out at the top in this enormous
p163
aVanvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere.
p164
aVThey are an expression of the majestic architecture
p165
aVof our atmosphere.
p166
aVBut from down below, they are the embodiment
p167
aVof the powerful, elemental force and power
p168
aVthat drives our atmosphere.
p169
aVTo be there is to be connected in the driving rain
p170
aVand the hail, to feel connected to our atmosphere.
p171
aVIt's to be reminded that we are creatures
p172
aVthat inhabit this ocean of air.
p173
aVWe don't live beneath the sky. We live within it.
p174
aVAnd that connection, that visceral connection to our atmosphere
p175
aVfeels to me like an antidote.
p176
aVIt's an antidote to the growing tendency we have
p177
aVto feel that we can really ever experience life
p178
aVby watching it on a computer screen, you know,
p179
aVwhen we're in a wi-fi zone.
p180
aVBut the one cloud that best expresses
p181
aVwhy cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever
p182
aVis this one, the cumulus cloud.
p183
aVRight? It forms on a sunny day.
p184
aVIf you close your eyes and think of a cloud,
p185
aVit's probably one of these that comes to mind.
p186
aVAll those cloud shapes at the beginning,
p187
aVthose were cumulus clouds.
p188
aVThe sharp, crisp outlines of this formation
p189
aVmake it the best one for finding shapes in.
p190
aVAnd it reminds us
p191
aVof the aimless nature of cloudspotting,
p192
aVwhat an aimless activity it is.
p193
aVYou're not going to change the world
p194
aVby lying on your back and gazing up at the sky, are you?
p195
aVIt's pointless. It's a pointless activity,
p196
aVwhich is precisely why it's so important.
p197
aVThe digital world conspires to make us feel
p198
aVeternally busy, perpetually busy.
p199
aVYou know, when you're not dealing with
p200
aVthe traditional pressures of earning a living
p201
aVand putting food on the table, raising a family,
p202
aVwriting thank you letters,
p203
aVyou have to now contend with
p204
aVanswering a mountain of unanswered emails,
p205
aVupdating a Facebook page,
p206
aVfeeding your Twitter feed.
p207
aVAnd cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing.
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aVAnd sometimes we need \u2014
p210
aV(Applause)
p211
aVSometimes we need excuses to do nothing.
p212
aVWe need to be reminded by these
p213
aVpatron goddesses of idle fellows
p214
aVthat slowing down
p215
aVand being in the present, not thinking about
p216
aVwhat you've got to do and what you should have done,
p217
aVbut just being here, letting your imagination
p218
aVlift from the everyday concerns down here
p219
aVand just being in the present, it's good for you,
p220
aVand it's good for the way you feel.
p221
aVIt's good for your ideas. It's good for your creativity.
p222
aVIt's good for your soul.
p223
aVSo keep looking up,
p224
aVmarvel at the ephemeral beauty,
p225
aVand always remember to live life with your head in the clouds.
p226
aVThank you very much.
p227
aV(Applause)

VWhen I was President of the American Psychological Association,
p5
aVthey tried to media-train me.
p6
aVAnd an encounter I had with CNN summarizes
p7
aVwhat I'm going to be talking about today,
p8
aVwhich is the eleventh reason to be optimistic.
p9
aVThe editor of Discover told us 10 of them;
p10
aVI'm going to give you the eleventh.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo they came to me, CNN, and they said, "Professor Seligman \u2014
p13
aVwould you tell us about the state of psychology today?
p14
aVWe'd like to interview you about that."
p15
aVAnd I said, "Great."
p16
aVAnd she said, "But this is CNN, so you only get a sound bite."
p17
aVI said, "Well, how many words do I get?"
p18
aVAnd she said, "Well, one."
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd the cameras rolled, and she said,
p23
aV"Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"
p24
aV"Good."
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
V"Cut! Cut. That won't do.
p29
aVWe'd really better give you a longer sound bite."
p30
aV"How many words do I get this time?"
p31
aV"Well, you get two."
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
V"Doctor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"
p36
aV"Not good."
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
V"Look, Doctor Seligman,
p41
aVwe can see you're really not comfortable in this medium.
p42
aVWe'd better give you a real sound bite.
p43
aVThis time you can have three words.
p44
aVProfessor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"
p45
aV"Not good enough."
p46
aVThat's what I'm going to be talking about.
p47
aa(lp48
VI want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good,
p49
aVand how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough.
p50
aVAnd by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology,
p51
aVabout entertainment and design,
p52
aVbecause I think the issues are very similar.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo, why was psychology good?
p55
aVWell, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model.
p56
aVTen years ago, when I was on an airplane
p57
aVand I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did,
p58
aVthey'd move away from me,
p59
aVbecause, quite rightly, they were saying
p60
aVpsychology is about finding what's wrong with you.
p61
aVSpot the loony.
p62
aVAnd now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhat was good about psychology \u2014
p65
aVabout the $30 billion investment NIMH made,
p66
aVabout working in the disease model,
p67
aVabout what you mean by psychology \u2014
p68
aVis that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable;
p69
aVit was entirely smoke and mirrors.
p70
aVAnd now, 14 of the disorders are treatable,
p71
aVtwo of them actually curable.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd the other thing that happened is that a science developed,
p74
aVa science of mental illness.
p75
aVWe found out we could take fuzzy concepts
p76
aVlike depression, alcoholism,
p77
aVand measure them with rigor;
p78
aVthat we could create a classification of the mental illnesses;
p79
aVthat we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses.
p80
aVWe could look across time at the same people \u2014
p81
aVpeople, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia \u2014
p82
aVand ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are,
p83
aVand we could isolate third variables
p84
aVby doing experiments on the mental illnesses.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years,
p87
aVto invent drug treatments and psychological treatments.
p88
aVAnd then we were able to test them rigorously,
p89
aVin random-assignment, placebo-controlled designs,
p90
aVthrow out the things that didn't work,
p91
aVkeep the things that actively did.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe conclusion of that is,
p94
aVpsychology and psychiatry of the last 60 years
p95
aVcan actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable.
p96
aVAnd I think that's terrific.
p97
aVI'm proud of it.
p98
aVBut what was not good, the consequences of that,
p99
aVwere three things.
p100
aa(lp101
VThe first was moral;
p102
aVthat psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers;
p103
aVthat our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble,
p104
aVbricks fell on you.
p105
aVAnd we forgot that people made choices and decisions.
p106
aVWe forgot responsibility.
p107
aVThat was the first cost.
p108
aa(lp109
VThe second cost was that we forgot about you people.
p110
aVWe forgot about improving normal lives.
p111
aVWe forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier,
p112
aVmore fulfilled, more productive.
p113
aVAnd "genius," "high-talent," became a dirty word.
p114
aVNo one works on that.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd the third problem about the disease model is,
p117
aVin our rush to do something about people in trouble,
p118
aVin our rush to do something about repairing damage,
p119
aVit never occurred to us to develop interventions
p120
aVto make people happier \u2014 positive interventions.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo that was not good.
p123
aVAnd so that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,
p124
aVMike Csikszentmihalyi and myself
p125
aVto work in something I call, "positive psychology,"
p126
aVwhich has three aims.
p127
aVThe first is that psychology should be just as concerned
p128
aVwith human strength as it is with weakness.
p129
aVIt should be just as concerned with building strength
p130
aVas with repairing damage.
p131
aVIt should be interested in the best things in life.
p132
aVAnd it should be just as concerned
p133
aVwith making the lives of normal people fulfilling,
p134
aVand with genius, with nurturing high talent.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo in the last 10 years and the hope for the future,
p137
aVwe've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology,
p138
aVa science of what makes life worth living.
p139
aVIt turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness.
p140
aVAnd any of you, for free, can go to that website \u2014
p141
aa(lp142
V[www.authentichappiness.org]
p143
aa(lp144
Vand take the entire panoply of tests of happiness.
p145
aVYou can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning,
p146
aVfor flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people?
p147
aVWe created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities:
p148
aVa classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio,
p149
aVhow they're defined, how to diagnose them,
p150
aVwhat builds them and what gets in their way.
p151
aVWe found that we could discover the causation of the positive states,
p152
aVthe relationship between left hemispheric activity
p153
aVand right hemispheric activity, as a cause of happiness.
p154
aa(lp155
VI've spent my life working on extremely miserable people,
p156
aVand I've asked the question:
p157
aVHow do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you?
p158
aVAnd starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people.
p159
aVHow do they differ from the rest of us?
p160
aVIt turns out there's one way, very surprising \u2014
p161
aVthey're not more religious, they're not in better shape,
p162
aVthey don't have more money, they're not better looking,
p163
aVthey don't have more good events and fewer bad events.
p164
aVThe one way in which they differ: they're extremely social.
p165
aVThey don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VThey don't spend time alone.
p170
aVEach of them is in a romantic relationship
p171
aVand each has a rich repertoire of friends.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut watch out here \u2014 this is merely correlational data, not causal,
p174
aVand it's about happiness in the first, "Hollywood" sense,
p175
aVI'm going to talk about,
p176
aVhappiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer.
p177
aVAnd I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough,
p178
aVin just a moment.
p179
aVWe found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries,
p180
aVfrom the Buddha to Tony Robbins.
p181
aVAbout 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy.
p182
aVAnd we find that we've been able to manualize many of them,
p183
aVand we actually carry out
p184
aVrandom-assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies.
p185
aVThat is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?
p186
aVIn a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.
p187
aa(lp188
VBut the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have,
p189
aVin addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill,
p190
aVand in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable,
p191
aVis, can psychology actually make people happier?
p192
aVAnd to ask that question \u2014 "happy" is not a word I use very much \u2014
p193
aVwe've had to break it down
p194
aVinto what I think is askable about "happy."
p195
aVAnd I believe there are three different \u2014
p196
aVI call them "different" because different interventions build them,
p197
aVit's possible to have one rather than the other \u2014
p198
aVthree different happy lives.
p199
aVThe first happy life is the pleasant life.
p200
aVThis is a life in which you have as much positive emotion
p201
aVas you possibly can,
p202
aVand the skills to amplify it.
p203
aVThe second is a life of engagement:
p204
aVa life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure;
p205
aVtime stops for you.
p206
aVThat's what Aristotle was talking about.
p207
aVAnd third, the meaningful life.
p208
aVI want to say a little bit about each of those lives
p209
aVand what we know about them.
p210
aa(lp211
VThe first life is the pleasant life, and it's simply, as best we can find it,
p212
aVit's having as many of the pleasures as you can,
p213
aVas much positive emotion as you can,
p214
aVand learning the skills \u2014 savoring, mindfulness \u2014 that amplify them,
p215
aVthat stretch them over time and space.
p216
aVBut the pleasant life has three drawbacks,
p217
aVand it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology,
p218
aVand why it doesn't end here.
p219
aa(lp220
VThe first drawback is, it turns out the pleasant life,
p221
aVyour experience of positive emotion,
p222
aVis about 50 percent heritable,
p223
aVand, in fact, not very modifiable.
p224
aVSo the different tricks that Matthieu and I and others know
p225
aVabout increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life
p226
aVare 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.
p227
aVSecond is that positive emotion habituates.
p228
aVIt habituates rapidly, indeed.
p229
aVIt's all like French vanilla ice cream:
p230
aVthe first taste is 100 percent;
p231
aVby the time you're down to the sixth taste,
p232
aVit's gone.
p233
aVAnd, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd this leads to the second life.
p236
aVI have to tell you about my friend Len,
p237
aVto talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion,
p238
aVmore than building pleasure.
p239
aVIn two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30,
p240
aVLen was enormously successful.
p241
aVThe first arena was work.
p242
aVBy the time he was 20, he was an options trader.
p243
aVBy the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire
p244
aVand the head of an options trading company.
p245
aVSecond, in play, he's a national champion bridge player.
p246
aVBut in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure.
p247
aVAnd the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VLen is an introvert.
p252
aVAmerican women said to Len, when he dated them,
p253
aV"You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost."
p254
aVAnd Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,
p255
aVwho for five years tried to find the sexual trauma
p256
aVthat had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.
p257
aVBut it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma.
p258
aVIt turned out that \u2014
p259
aVLen grew up in Long Island
p260
aVand he played football and watched football, and played bridge.
p261
aVLen is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.
p262
aa(lp263
VThe question is: Is Len unhappy?
p264
aVAnd I want to say, not.
p265
aVContrary to what psychology told us
p266
aVabout the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity,
p267
aVI think Len is one of the happiest people I know.
p268
aVHe's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness,
p269
aVand that's because Len, like most of you,
p270
aVis enormously capable of flow.
p271
aVWhen he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange
p272
aVat 9:30 in the morning,
p273
aVtime stops for him.
p274
aVAnd it stops till the closing bell.
p275
aVWhen the first card is played till 10 days later,
p276
aVwhen the tournament is over,
p277
aVtime stops for Len.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi
p280
aVhas been talking about, about flow.
p281
aVAnd it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way:
p282
aVpleasure has raw feel \u2014 you know it's happening; it's thought and feeling.
p283
aVBut what Mike told you yesterday \u2014 during flow ...
p284
aVyou can't feel anything.
p285
aVYou're one with the music.
p286
aVTime stops.
p287
aVYou have intense concentration.
p288
aVAnd this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life.
p289
aVAnd we think there's a recipe for it,
p290
aVand it's knowing what your highest strengths are \u2014
p291
aVagain, there's a valid test
p292
aVof what your five highest strengths are \u2014
p293
aVand then re-crafting your life
p294
aVto use them as much as you possibly can.
p295
aVRe-crafting your work, your love,
p296
aVyour play, your friendship, your parenting.
p297
aa(lp298
VJust one example.
p299
aVOne person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's.
p300
aVHated the job.
p301
aVShe's working her way through college.
p302
aVHer highest strength was social intelligence.
p303
aVSo she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her
p304
aVthe social highlight of every customer's day.
p305
aVNow, obviously she failed.
p306
aVBut what she did was to take her highest strengths,
p307
aVand re-craft work to use them as much as possible.
p308
aVWhat you get out of that is not smiley-ness.
p309
aVYou don't look like Debbie Reynolds.
p310
aVYou don't giggle a lot.
p311
aVWhat you get is more absorption.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo, that's the second path.
p314
aVThe first path, positive emotion;
p315
aVthe second path is eudaemonian flow;
p316
aVand the third path is meaning.
p317
aVThis is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.
p318
aVAnd meaning, in this view, consists of \u2014
p319
aVvery parallel to eudaemonia \u2014
p320
aVit consists of knowing what your highest strengths are,
p321
aVand using them to belong to and in the service of
p322
aVsomething larger than you are.
p323
aa(lp324
VI mentioned that for all three kinds of lives \u2014
p325
aVthe pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life \u2014
p326
aVpeople are now hard at work on the question:
p327
aVAre there things that lastingly change those lives?
p328
aVAnd the answer seems to be yes.
p329
aVAnd I'll just give you some samples of it.
p330
aVIt's being done in a rigorous manner.
p331
aVIt's being done in the same way that we test drugs
p332
aVto see what really works.
p333
aVSo we do random-assignment, placebo-controlled,
p334
aVlong-term studies of different interventions.
p335
aVJust to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect:
p336
aVwhen we teach people about the pleasant life,
p337
aVhow to have more pleasure in your life,
p338
aVone of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills,
p339
aVthe savoring skills,
p340
aVand you're assigned to design a beautiful day.
p341
aVNext Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day,
p342
aVand use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures.
p343
aVAnd we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.
p344
aa(lp345
VGratitude visit.
p346
aVI want you all to do this with me now, if you would.
p347
aVClose your eyes.
p348
aVI'd like you to remember someone
p349
aVwho did something enormously important
p350
aVthat changed your life in a good direction,
p351
aVand who you never properly thanked.
p352
aVThe person has to be alive.
p353
aVNow, OK, you can open your eyes.
p354
aVI hope all of you have such a person.
p355
aVYour assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit,
p356
aVis to write a 300-word testimonial to that person,
p357
aVcall them on the phone in Phoenix,
p358
aVask if you can visit, don't tell them why.
p359
aVShow up at their door,
p360
aVyou read the testimonial \u2014 everyone weeps when this happens.
p361
aVAnd what happens is, when we test people
p362
aVone week later, a month later, three months later,
p363
aVthey're both happier and less depressed.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnother example is a strengths date,
p366
aVin which we get couples to identify their highest strengths
p367
aVon the strengths test,
p368
aVand then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths.
p369
aVWe find this is a strengthener of relationships.
p370
aVAnd fun versus philanthropy.
p371
aVIt's so heartening to be in a group like this,
p372
aVin which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.
p373
aVWell, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this,
p374
aVso we actually have people do something altruistic
p375
aVand do something fun,
p376
aVand contrast it.
p377
aVAnd what you find is when you do something fun,
p378
aVit has a square wave walk set.
p379
aVWhen you do something philanthropic to help another person,
p380
aVit lasts and it lasts.
p381
aVSo those are examples of positive interventions.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo the next to last thing I want to say is:
p384
aVwe're interested in how much life satisfaction people have.
p385
aVThis is really what you're about.
p386
aVAnd that's our target variable.
p387
aVAnd we ask the question as a function of the three different lives,
p388
aVhow much life satisfaction do you get?
p389
aVSo we ask \u2014 and we've done this in 15 replications,
p390
aVinvolving thousands of people:
p391
aVTo what extent does the pursuit of pleasure,
p392
aVthe pursuit of positive emotion,
p393
aVthe pleasant life,
p394
aVthe pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you,
p395
aVand the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?
p396
aa(lp397
VAnd our results surprised us; they were backward of what we thought.
p398
aVIt turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution
p399
aVto life satisfaction.
p400
aVThe pursuit of meaning is the strongest.
p401
aVThe pursuit of engagement is also very strong.
p402
aVWhere pleasure matters is if you have both engagement
p403
aVand you have meaning,
p404
aVthen pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry.
p405
aVWhich is to say, the full life \u2014 the sum is greater than the parts,
p406
aVif you've got all three.
p407
aVConversely, if you have none of the three, the empty life,
p408
aVthe sum is less than the parts.
p409
aa(lp410
VAnd what we're asking now is: Does the very same relationship \u2014
p411
aVphysical health, morbidity, how long you live and productivity \u2014
p412
aVfollow the same relationship?
p413
aVThat is, in a corporation,
p414
aVis productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning?
p415
aVIs health a function of positive engagement,
p416
aVof pleasure, and of meaning in life?
p417
aVAnd there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.
p418
aa(lp419
VSo, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance
p420
aVto try to integrate what he heard,
p421
aVand so this was amazing for me.
p422
aVI've never been in a gathering like this.
p423
aVI've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much,
p424
aVwhich was one of the remarkable things.
p425
aVBut I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel
p426
aVto the problems of technology, entertainment and design
p427
aVin the following way:
p428
aVwe all know that technology, entertainment and design
p429
aVhave been and can be used for destructive purposes.
p430
aVWe also know that technology, entertainment and design
p431
aVcan be used to relieve misery.
p432
aVAnd by the way, the distinction between relieving misery
p433
aVand building happiness is extremely important.
p434
aVI thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago,
p435
aVthat if I was good enough to make someone not depressed,
p436
aVnot anxious, not angry,
p437
aVthat I'd make them happy.
p438
aVAnd I never found that;
p439
aVI found the best you could ever do
p440
aVwas to get to zero;
p441
aVthat they were empty.
p442
aa(lp443
VAnd it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life,
p444
aVthe skills of engagement, the skills of meaning,
p445
aVare different from the skills of relieving misery.
p446
aVAnd so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment
p447
aVand design, I believe.
p448
aVThat is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world
p449
aVto increase happiness,
p450
aVto increase positive emotion.
p451
aVAnd that's typically how they've been used.
p452
aVBut once you fractionate happiness the way I do \u2014
p453
aVnot just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough \u2014
p454
aVthere's flow in life, and there's meaning in life.
p455
aVAs Laura Lee told us,
p456
aVdesign and, I believe, entertainment and technology,
p457
aVcan be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.
p458
aa(lp459
VSo in conclusion,
p460
aVthe eleventh reason for optimism,
p461
aVin addition to the space elevator,
p462
aVis that I think with technology, entertainment and design,
p463
aVwe can actually increase the amount of tonnage
p464
aVof human happiness on the planet.
p465
aVAnd if technology can, in the next decade or two,
p466
aVincrease the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life,
p467
aVit will be good enough.
p468
aVIf entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion,
p469
aVmeaning eudaemonia,
p470
aVit will be good enough.
p471
aVAnd if design can increase positive emotion,
p472
aVeudaemonia, and flow and meaning,
p473
aVwhat we're all doing together will become good enough.
p474
aa(lp475
VThank you.

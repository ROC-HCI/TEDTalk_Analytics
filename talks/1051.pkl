VIf we look around us,
p5
aVmuch of what surrounds us
p6
aVstarted life as various rocks and sludge
p7
aVburied in the ground in various places in the world.
p8
aVBut, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.
p9
aVThey look like TV cameras, monitors,
p10
aVannoying radio mics.
p11
aVAnd so this magical transformation
p12
aVis what I was trying to get at with my project,
p13
aVwhich became known as the Toaster Project.
p14
aVAnd it was also inspired by this quote
p15
aVfrom Douglas Adams,
p16
aVand the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
p17
aVAnd the situation it describes
p18
aVis the hero of the book \u2014 he's a 20th-century man \u2014
p19
aVfinds himself alone on a strange planet
p20
aVpopulated only by a technologically primitive people.
p21
aVAnd he kind of assumes that, yes,
p22
aVhe'll become \u2014 these villagers \u2014
p23
aVhe'll become their emperor
p24
aVand transform their society
p25
aVwith his wonderful command of technology
p26
aVand science and the elements,
p27
aVbut, of course, realizes
p28
aVthat without the rest of human society,
p29
aVhe can barely make a sandwich,
p30
aVlet alone a toaster.
p31
aVBut he didn't have Wikipedia.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo I thought, okay,
p34
aVI'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch.
p35
aVAnd, working on the idea
p36
aVthat the cheapest electric toaster
p37
aVwould also be the simplest to reverse-engineer,
p38
aVI went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find,
p39
aVtook it home
p40
aVand was kind of dismayed to discover
p41
aVthat, inside this object,
p42
aVwhich I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds,
p43
aVthere were 400 different bits
p44
aVmade out of a hundred-plus different materials.
p45
aVI didn't have the rest of my life to do this project.
p46
aVI had maybe nine months.
p47
aVSo I thought, okay, I'll start with five.
p48
aVAnd these were steel, mica,
p49
aVplastic, copper and nickel.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo, starting with steel: how do you make steel?
p52
aVI went and knocked on the door
p53
aVof the Rio Tinto Chair
p54
aVof Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines
p55
aVand said, "How do you make steel?"
p56
aVAnd Professor Cilliers was very kind
p57
aVand talked me through it.
p58
aVAnd my vague rememberings from GCSE science \u2014
p59
aVwell, steel comes from iron,
p60
aVso I phoned up an iron mine.
p61
aVAnd said, "Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster.
p62
aVCan I come up and get some iron?"
p63
aVUnfortunately, when I got there \u2014 emerges Ray.
p64
aVHe had misheard me
p65
aVand thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster,
p66
aVand so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines.
p67
aVBut after some nagging, I got him to do that.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone,
p70
aVand that was produced
p71
aVby sea creatures
p72
aV350 million years ago
p73
aVin a nice, warm,
p74
aVsunny atmosphere.
p75
aVWhen you study geology,
p76
aVyou can see what's happened in the past,
p77
aVand there were terrific changes in the earth.
p78
aa(lp79
VThomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.
p80
aVAnd of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore,
p81
aVbecause, though Ray was a miner there,
p82
aVthe mine had closed
p83
aVand had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction,
p84
aVbecause, of course, it can't compete
p85
aVon the scale of operations which are happening
p86
aVin South America, Australia, wherever.
p87
aVBut anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore
p88
aVand dragged it back to London on the train,
p89
aVand then was faced with the problem:
p90
aVOkay, how do you make this rock
p91
aVinto components for a toaster?
p92
aa(lp93
VSo I went back to Professor Cilliers,
p94
aVand he said, "Go to the library."
p95
aVSo I did
p96
aVand was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy \u2014
p97
aVcompletely useless for what I was trying to do.
p98
aVBecause, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it
p99
aVif you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant.
p100
aVSo I ended up going to the History of Science Library
p101
aVand looking at this book.
p102
aVThis is the first textbook on metallurgy
p103
aVwritten in the West, at least.
p104
aVAnd there you can see that woodcut
p105
aVis basically what I ended up doing.
p106
aVBut instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVAnd that was something that reoccurred throughout the project,
p109
aVwas, the smaller the scale you want to work on,
p110
aVthe further back in time you have to go.
p111
aVAnd so this is after
p112
aVa day and about half a night
p113
aVsmelting this iron.
p114
aVI dragged out this stuff,
p115
aVand it wasn't iron.
p116
aVBut luckily,
p117
aVI found a patent online
p118
aVfor industrial furnaces that use microwaves,
p119
aVand at 30 minutes at full power,
p120
aVand I was able to finish off the process.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo, my next \u2014
p123
aV(Applause)
p124
aVThe next thing I was trying to get was copper.
p125
aVAgain, this mine
p126
aVwas once the largest copper mine in the world.
p127
aVIt's not anymore,
p128
aVbut I found a retired geology professor
p129
aVto take me down,
p130
aVand he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine."
p131
aVAnd the reason I was interested in getting water
p132
aVis because water which goes through mines
p133
aVbecomes kind of acidic
p134
aVand will start picking up,
p135
aVdissolving the minerals from the mine.
p136
aVAnd a good example of this is the Rio Tinto,
p137
aVwhich is in Portugal.
p138
aVAs you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.
p139
aVSo many such
p140
aVthat it's now just a home for bacteria
p141
aVwho really like acidic, toxic conditions.
p142
aVBut anyway, the water I dragged back
p143
aVfrom the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was \u2014
p144
aVthere was enough copper in it
p145
aVsuch that I could cast the pins
p146
aVof my metal electric plug.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo my next thing: I was off to Scotland
p149
aVto get mica.
p150
aVAnd mica is a mineral
p151
aVwhich is a very good insulator
p152
aVand very good at insulating electricity.
p153
aVThat's me getting mica.
p154
aVAnd the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,
p155
aVand, of course,
p156
aVmy toaster had to have a plastic case.
p157
aVPlastic is the defining feature
p158
aVof cheap electrical goods.
p159
aVAnd so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP
p160
aVand spent a good half an hour
p161
aVtrying to convince the PR office at BP
p162
aVthat it would be fantastic for them
p163
aVif they flew me to an oil rig
p164
aVand let me have a jug of oil.
p165
aVBP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.
p166
aVBut even then
p167
aVthey weren't convinced
p168
aVand said, "Okay, we'll phone you back" \u2014 never did.
p169
aVSo I looked at other ways of making plastic.
p170
aVAnd you can actually make plastic
p171
aVfrom obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.
p172
aVSo this is attempting to make
p173
aVpotato starch plastic.
p174
aVAnd for a while that was looking really good.
p175
aVI poured it into the mold, which you can see there,
p176
aVwhich I've made from a tree trunk.
p177
aVAnd it was looking good for a while,
p178
aVbut I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,
p179
aVand unfortunately I came back
p180
aVand there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo kind of out of desperation,
p183
aVI decided that I could think laterally.
p184
aVAnd geologists have actually christened \u2014
p185
aVwell, they're debating whether to christen \u2014
p186
aVthe age that we're living in \u2014
p187
aVthey're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch
p188
aVcalled the Anthropocene, the age of Man.
p189
aVAnd that's because geologists of the future
p190
aVwould kind of see a sharp shift
p191
aVin the strata of rock that is being laid down now.
p192
aVSo suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl
p193
aVand the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs
p194
aVthat have been set off since 1945.
p195
aVAnd there'd also be an extinction event \u2014
p196
aVlike fossils would suddenly disappear.
p197
aVAnd also, I thought
p198
aVthat there would be
p199
aVsynthetic polymers,
p200
aVplastics, embedded in the rock.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo I looked up a plastic \u2014
p203
aVso I decided that I could mine
p204
aVsome of this modern-day rock.
p205
aVAnd I went up to Manchester
p206
aVto visit a place called Axion Recycling.
p207
aVAnd they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,
p208
aVwhich is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.
p209
aVAnd that was brought into force
p210
aVto try and deal with the mountain of stuff
p211
aVthat is just being made
p212
aVand then living for a while in our homes
p213
aVand then going to landfill.
p214
aVBut this is it.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Music)
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VSo there's a picture
p221
aVof my toaster.
p222
aV(Applause)
p223
aVThat's it without the case on.
p224
aVAnd there it is on the shelves.
p225
aVThanks.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VBruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.
p230
aa(lp231
VTT: Yeah, I did plug it in.
p232
aVI don't know if you could see,
p233
aVbut I was never able to make insulation for the wires.
p234
aVKew Gardens were insistent
p235
aVthat I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.
p236
aVSo the wires were uninsulated.
p237
aVSo there was 240 volts
p238
aVgoing through these homemade copper wires,
p239
aVhomemade plug.
p240
aVAnd for about five seconds,
p241
aVthe toaster toasted,
p242
aVbut then, unfortunately,
p243
aVthe element kind of melted itself.
p244
aVBut I considered it a partial success, to be honest.
p245
aa(lp246
VBG: Thomas Thwaites. TT: Thanks.

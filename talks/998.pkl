VI guess the story actually has to start
p5
aVmaybe back in the the 1960s,
p6
aVwhen I was seven or eight years old,
p7
aVwatching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor
p8
aVwith my mask and flippers on.
p9
aVThen after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub
p10
aVand swim around the bathtub and look at the drain,
p11
aVbecause that's all there was to look at.
p12
aVAnd by the time I turned 16,
p13
aVI pursued a career in marine science,
p14
aVin exploration and diving,
p15
aVand lived in underwater habitats, like this one off the Florida Keys,
p16
aVfor 30 days total.
p17
aVBrian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian.
p18
aVAnd I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world.
p19
aVAnd this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world,
p20
aVoperated by the Japanese government.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd Sylvia Earle and I
p23
aVwere on an expedition in this submarine
p24
aV20 years ago in Japan.
p25
aVAnd on my dive, I went down 18,000 feet,
p26
aVto an area that I thought
p27
aVwould be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor.
p28
aVBut when I got there, I found
p29
aVlots of plastic garbage and other debris.
p30
aVAnd it was really a turning point in my life,
p31
aVwhere I started to realize
p32
aVthat I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration.
p33
aVI needed to put it into a context.
p34
aVI needed to head towards conservation goals.
p35
aVSo I began to work
p36
aVwith National Geographic Society and others
p37
aVand led expeditions to Antarctica.
p38
aVI led three diving expeditions to Antarctica.
p39
aVTen years ago was a seminal trip,
p40
aVwhere we explored that big iceberg, B-15,
p41
aVthe largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.
p42
aVAnd we developed techniques
p43
aVto dive inside and under the iceberg,
p44
aVsuch as heating pads on our kidneys
p45
aVwith a battery that we dragged around,
p46
aVso that, as the blood flowed through our kidneys,
p47
aVit would get a little boost of warmth
p48
aVbefore going back into our bodies.
p49
aVBut after three trips to Antarctica,
p50
aVI decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water.
p51
aVAnd that same year, 10 years ago,
p52
aVI headed north to the Phoenix Islands.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment.
p55
aVBut before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment.
p56
aVYou may have seen this in other forms,
p57
aVbut the top line is the amount of protected area
p58
aVon land, globally,
p59
aVand it's about 12 percent.
p60
aVAnd you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up
p61
aVaround the 1960s and '70s,
p62
aVand it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now.
p63
aVAnd that's probably because
p64
aVthat's when everybody got aware of the environment
p65
aVand Earth Day
p66
aVand all the stuff that happened in the '60s with the Hippies and everything
p67
aVreally did, I think, have an affect on global awareness.
p68
aVBut the ocean-protected area
p69
aVis basically flat line
p70
aVuntil right about now \u2014 it appears to be ticking up.
p71
aVAnd I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point
p72
aVof the protected area in the ocean.
p73
aVI think we would have gotten there a lot earlier
p74
aVif we could see what happens in the ocean
p75
aVlike we can see what happens on land.
p76
aVBut unfortunately, the ocean is opaque,
p77
aVand we can't see what's going on.
p78
aVAnd therefore we're way behind on protection.
p79
aVBut scuba diving, submersibles
p80
aVand all the work that we're setting about to do here
p81
aVwill help rectify that.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo where are the Phoenix Islands?
p84
aVThey were the world's largest marine-protected area
p85
aVup until last week
p86
aVwhen the Chagos Archipelago was declared.
p87
aVIt's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere.
p88
aVIf you want to get to the Phoenix Islands,
p89
aVit's five days from Fiji,
p90
aVit's five days from Hawaii, it's five days from Samoa.
p91
aVIt's out in the middle of the Pacific,
p92
aVright around the Equator.
p93
aVI had never heard of the islands 10 years ago,
p94
aVnor the country, Kiribati, that owns them,
p95
aVtill two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji
p96
aVsaid, "Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands?
p97
aVThey've never been dived."
p98
aVAnd I said, "Yeah.
p99
aVBut tell me where they are and the country that owns them."
p100
aVSo that's when I first learned of the Islands
p101
aVand had no idea what I was getting into.
p102
aVBut I was in for the adventure.
p103
aVLet me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.
p104
aVIt's a very deep-water part of our planet.
p105
aVThe average depths are about 12,000 ft.
p106
aVThere's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands,
p107
aVwhich are specifically part of the protected area.
p108
aVSeamounts are important for biodiversity.
p109
aVThere's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land.
p110
aVIt's an interesting fact.
p111
aVAnd the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.
p112
aVSo it's a deep \u2014 think about it in a big three-dimensional space,
p113
aVvery deep three-dimensional space
p114
aVwith herds of tuna, whales,
p115
aVall kinds of deep sea marine life
p116
aVlike we've seen here before.
p117
aa(lp118
VThat's the vessel that we took up there
p119
aVfor these studies, early on,
p120
aVand that's what the Islands look like \u2014 you can see in the background.
p121
aVThey're very low to the water,
p122
aVand they're all uninhabited, except one island
p123
aVhas about 35 caretakers on it.
p124
aVAnd they've been uninhabited for most of time
p125
aVbecause even in the ancient days,
p126
aVthese islands were too far away
p127
aVfrom the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti
p128
aVfor those ancient Polynesian mariners
p129
aVthat were traversing the Pacific so widely.
p130
aVBut we got up there,
p131
aVand I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity
p132
aVto get to a place that had never been dived
p133
aVand just get to an island and go, "Okay, where are we going to dive?
p134
aVLet's try there,"
p135
aVand then falling into the water.
p136
aVBoth my personal and my professional life changed.
p137
aa(lp138
VSuddenly, I saw a world
p139
aVthat I had never seen before in the ocean \u2014
p140
aVschools of fish that were so dense
p141
aVthey dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface,
p142
aVcoral reefs that were continuous
p143
aVand solid and colorful,
p144
aVlarge fish everywhere,
p145
aVmanta rays.
p146
aVIt was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning \u2014
p147
aVthis is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning
p148
aVat the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands.
p149
aVYou can see the fish are balled up
p150
aVand then there's a little cloudy area there
p151
aVwhere they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction \u2014
p152
aVevents that the ocean is supposed to do,
p153
aVbut struggles to do in many places now
p154
aVbecause of human activity.
p155
aVThe Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet
p156
aVare very important for tuna fisheries,
p157
aVespecially this yellowfin tuna that you see here.
p158
aVPhoenix Islands is a major tuna location.
p159
aVAnd sharks \u2014 we had sharks on our early dives,
p160
aVup to 150 sharks at once,
p161
aVwhich is an indication
p162
aVof a very, very healthy, very strong, system.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo I thought the scenes
p165
aVof never-ending wilderness
p166
aVwould go on forever,
p167
aVbut they did finally come to an end.
p168
aVAnd we explored the surface of the Islands as well \u2014
p169
aVvery important bird nesting site,
p170
aVsome of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world.
p171
aVAnd we finished our trip.
p172
aVAnd that's the area again.
p173
aVYou can see the Islands \u2014 there are eight islands \u2014
p174
aVthat pop out of the water.
p175
aVThe peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts.
p176
aVRemember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd what's the context of the Phoenix Islands?
p179
aVWhere do these exist?
p180
aVWell they exist in the Republic of Kiribati,
p181
aVand Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific
p182
aVin three island groups.
p183
aVIn the west we have the Gilbert Islands.
p184
aVIn the center we have the Phoenix Islands,
p185
aVwhich is the subject that I'm talking about.
p186
aVAnd then over to the east we have the Line Islands.
p187
aVIt's the largest atoll nation in the world.
p188
aVAnd they have
p189
aVabout 110,000 people
p190
aVspread out over 33 islands.
p191
aVThey control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean,
p192
aVand that's between one and two percent
p193
aVof all the ocean water on the planet.
p194
aVAnd when I was first going up there,
p195
aVI barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago,
p196
aVand people would ask me,
p197
aV"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?"
p198
aVAnd it reminded me of that old joke
p199
aVwhere the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed,
p200
aVand the reporter yells, "Hey, Willy. Why do you rob banks?"
p201
aVAnd he says, "cause that's where all the money is."
p202
aVAnd I would tell people, "Why do I go to Kiribati?
p203
aVBecause that's where all the ocean is."
p204
aVThey basically are one nation
p205
aVthat controls most of the equatorial waters
p206
aVof the Central Pacific Ocean.
p207
aa(lp208
VThey're also a country
p209
aVthat is in dire danger.
p210
aVSea levels are rising,
p211
aVand Kiribati, along with 42 other nations in the world,
p212
aVwill be under water within 50 to 100 years
p213
aVdue to climate change
p214
aVand the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion
p215
aVand the melting of freshwater into the ocean.
p216
aVThe Islands rise only one to two meters
p217
aVabove the surface.
p218
aVSome of the islands have already gone under water.
p219
aVAnd these nations are faced with a real problem.
p220
aVWe as a world are faced with a problem.
p221
aVWhat do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings
p222
aVwho no longer have a home on the planet?
p223
aVThe president of the Maldives
p224
aVconducted a mock cabinet meeting
p225
aVunderwater recently
p226
aVto highlight the dire straits of these countries.
p227
aVSo it's something we need to focus on.
p228
aVBut back to the Phoenix Islands,
p229
aVwhich is the subject of this Talk.
p230
aa(lp231
VAfter I got back, I said,
p232
aVokay, this is amazing, what we found.
p233
aVI'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati,
p234
aVwho are over in Tarawa,
p235
aVthe westernmost group.
p236
aVSo I started contacting them \u2014
p237
aVbecause they had actually given me a permit to do this \u2014
p238
aVand I said, "I want to come up and tell you what we found."
p239
aVAnd for some reason they didn't want me to come,
p240
aVor it was hard to find a time and a place, and it took a while,
p241
aVbut finally they said, "Okay, you can come.
p242
aVBut if you come, you have to buy lunch
p243
aVfor everybody who comes to the seminar."
p244
aVSo I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch.
p245
aVJust get whatever anybody wants."
p246
aVSo David Obura, a coral reef biologist, and I went to Tarawa,
p247
aVand we presented for two hours
p248
aVon the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands.
p249
aVAnd the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area.
p250
aVThey'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands.
p251
aVAfter the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me
p252
aVand he said, "Greg, do you realize
p253
aVthat you are the first scientist
p254
aVwho has ever come back
p255
aVand told us what they did?"
p256
aVHe said, "We often issue these permits
p257
aVto do research in our waters,
p258
aVbut usually we get a note two or three years later,
p259
aVor a reprint.
p260
aVBut you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did.
p261
aVAnd we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today.
p262
aVAnd are you free for dinner?"
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd I was free for dinner,
p265
aVand I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati.
p266
aVAnd over the course of dinner,
p267
aVI learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue \u2014
p268
aVit's a very poor country \u2014
p269
aVbut it gains what revenue is has
p270
aVby selling access to foreign nations
p271
aVto take fish out of its waters,
p272
aVbecause Kiribati does not have the capacity
p273
aVto take the fish itself.
p274
aVAnd the deal that they strike
p275
aVis the extracting country
p276
aVgives Kiribati five percent
p277
aVof the landed value.
p278
aVSo if the United States
p279
aVremoves a million dollars'
p280
aVworth of lobsters from a reef,
p281
aVKiribati gets 50,000 dollars.
p282
aVAnd, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me.
p283
aVSo I asked the Minister over dinner,
p284
aVI said, "Would you consider a situation
p285
aVwhere you would still get paid \u2014
p286
aVwe do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is \u2014
p287
aVbut you leave fish and the sharks
p288
aVand the shrimp in the water?"
p289
aVHe stopped, and he said, "Yes, we would like to do that
p290
aVto deal with our overfishing problem,
p291
aVand I think we would call it a reverse fishing license."
p292
aVHe coined the term "reverse fishing license."
p293
aVSo I said, "Yes, a 'reverse fishing license.'"
p294
aa(lp295
VSo we walked away from this dinner
p296
aVreally not knowing where to go at that point.
p297
aVI went back to the States and started looking around
p298
aVto see if I could find examples
p299
aVwhere reverse fishing licenses
p300
aVhad been issued,
p301
aVand it turned out there were none.
p302
aVThere were no oceanic deals
p303
aVwhere countries were compensated for not fishing.
p304
aVIt had occurred on land,
p305
aVin rainforests of South America and Africa,
p306
aVwhere landowners had been paid
p307
aVnot to cut the trees down.
p308
aVAnd Conservation International had struck some of those deals.
p309
aVSo I went to Conservation International
p310
aVand brought them in as a partner
p311
aVand went through the process
p312
aVof valuing the fishery resource,
p313
aVdeciding how much Kiribati should be compensated,
p314
aVwhat the range of the fishes were,
p315
aVbrought in a whole bunch of other partners \u2014
p316
aVthe government of Australia,
p317
aVthe government of New Zealand, the World Bank.
p318
aVThe Oak Foundation and National Geographic
p319
aVhave been big funders of this as well.
p320
aVAnd we basically founded the park
p321
aVon the idea of an endowment
p322
aVthat would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees
p323
aVto this very poor country
p324
aVto keep the area intact.
p325
aa(lp326
VHalfway through this process, I met the president of Kiribati,
p327
aVPresident Anote Tong.
p328
aVHe's a really important leader,
p329
aVa real visionary, forward-thinking man,
p330
aVand he told me two things when I approached him.
p331
aVHe said, "Greg, there's two things I'd like you to do.
p332
aVOne is, remember I'm a politician,
p333
aVso you've got to go out and work with my ministers
p334
aVand convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea.
p335
aVSecondly, I'd like you to create principles
p336
aVthat will transcend my own presidency.
p337
aVI don't want to do something like this
p338
aVif it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office."
p339
aVSo we had very strong leadership, very good vision
p340
aVand a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved.
p341
aVMany, many steps were taken to pull this off.
p342
aVAnd it was primarily because Kiribati realized
p343
aVthat this was in their own self-interest to do this.
p344
aVThey realized that this was a common cause
p345
aVthat they had found
p346
aVwith the conservation community.
p347
aa(lp348
VThen in 2002,
p349
aVwhen this was all going full-swing,
p350
aVa coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.
p351
aVHere's this resource that we're looking to save,
p352
aVand it turns out it's the hottest heating event
p353
aVthat we can find on record.
p354
aVThe ocean heated up as it does sometimes,
p355
aVand the hot spot formed and stalled
p356
aVright over the Phoenix Islands for six months.
p357
aVIt was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months
p358
aVand it basically killed
p359
aV60 percent of the coral.
p360
aVSo suddenly we had this area that we were protecting,
p361
aVbut now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas.
p362
aVOf course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine,
p363
aVbut the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble.
p364
aVWell, the good news is it's recovered
p365
aVand recovering fast,
p366
aVfaster than any reef we've seen.
p367
aVThis picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago
p368
aVwhen we returned to the Phoenix Islands
p369
aVand discovered that, because it is a protected area
p370
aVand has healthy fish populations
p371
aVthat keep the algae grazed down
p372
aVand keep the rest of the reef healthy,
p373
aVthe coral is booming, is just booming back.
p374
aVIt's almost like if a person
p375
aVhas multiple diseases,
p376
aVit's hard to get well, you might die,
p377
aVbut if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better.
p378
aVAnd that's the story with climate-change heating.
p379
aVIt's the only threat,
p380
aVthe only influence that the reef had to deal with.
p381
aVThere was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development,
p382
aVand the reef is on a full-bore recovery.
p383
aa(lp384
VNow I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries 10 years ago
p385
aVwhen we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner
p386
aVand said, "Well, I think that the conservation community
p387
aVmight embrace this idea, Minister."
p388
aVHe paused and put his hands together and said,
p389
aV"Yes, Greg,
p390
aVbut the devil will be in the details," he said.
p391
aVAnd it certainly was.
p392
aVThe last 10 years have been detail after detail
p393
aVranging from creating legislation
p394
aVto multiple research expeditions
p395
aVto communication plans,
p396
aVas I said, teams of lawyers,
p397
aVMOUs,
p398
aVcreating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board.
p399
aVAnd we are now in the process of raising the full endowment.
p400
aVKiribati has frozen extracting activities
p401
aVat its current state while we raise the endowment.
p402
aVWe just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago.
p403
aVSo it's a fully functional
p404
aVup-and-running entity
p405
aVthat negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country.
p406
aVAnd the PIPA Trust Board holds that license
p407
aVand pays the country for this.
p408
aVSo it's a very solid, very well thought-out,
p409
aVvery well grounded system,
p410
aVand it was a bottom-up system,
p411
aVand that was very important with this work,
p412
aVfrom the bottom up to secure this.
p413
aVSo the conditions for success here are listed.
p414
aVYou can read them yourselves.
p415
aVBut I would say the most important one in my mind
p416
aVwas working within the market forces
p417
aVof the situation.
p418
aVAnd that insured that we could move this forward
p419
aVand it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati
p420
aVas well as the self-interest of the world.
p421
aa(lp422
VAnd I'll leave you with one final slide,
p423
aVthat is: how do we scale this up?
p424
aVHow do we realize Sylvia's dream?
p425
aVWhere eventually do we take this?
p426
aVHere's the Pacific
p427
aVwith large MPAs
p428
aVand large conservation zones on it.
p429
aVAnd as you can see,
p430
aVwe have a patchwork across this ocean.
p431
aVI've just described to you the one story
p432
aVbehind that rectangular area in the middle, the Phoenix Islands,
p433
aVbut every other green patch on that
p434
aVhas its own story.
p435
aVAnd what we need to do now
p436
aVis look at the whole Pacific Ocean
p437
aVin its entirety
p438
aVand make a network of MPAs
p439
aVacross the Pacific
p440
aVso that we have our world's largest ocean
p441
aVprotected and self-sustaining
p442
aVover time.
p443
aa(lp444
VThank you very much. (Applause)

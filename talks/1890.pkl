VI'm a man who's trying to live from his heart,
p5
aVand so just before I get going,
p6
aVI wanted to tell you as a South African
p7
aVthat one of the men who has inspired me most
p8
aVpassed away a few hours ago.
p9
aVNelson Mandela has come to the end
p10
aVof his long walk to freedom.
p11
aVAnd so this talk is going to be for him.
p12
aa(lp13
VI grew up in wonder.
p14
aVI grew up amongst those animals.
p15
aVI grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa
p16
aVat a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.
p17
aVIt's a place where my family has been
p18
aVin the safari business for four generations.
p19
aVNow for as long as I can remember,
p20
aVmy job has been to take people out into nature,
p21
aVand so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today
p22
aVto have the opportunity
p23
aVto bring some of my experiences out in nature
p24
aVin to this gathering.
p25
aVAfrica is a place
p26
aVwhere people still sit under starlit skies
p27
aVand around campfires and tell stories,
p28
aVand so what I have to share with you today
p29
aVis the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,
p30
aVstories about heroes of heart.
p31
aVNow my stories are not the stories
p32
aVthat you'll hear on the news,
p33
aVand while it's true that Africa is a harsh place,
p34
aVI also know it to be a place
p35
aVwhere people, animals and ecosystems
p36
aVteach us about a more interconnected world.
p37
aa(lp38
VWhen I was nine years old,
p39
aVPresident Mandela came to stay with my family.
p40
aVHe had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration,
p41
aVand was in a period of readjustment
p42
aVto his sudden global icon status.
p43
aVMembers of the African National Congress
p44
aVthought that in the bush
p45
aVhe would have time to rest and recuperate
p46
aVaway from the public eye,
p47
aVand it's true that lions tend to be
p48
aVa very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVBut it was a defining time for me as a young boy.
p51
aVI would take him breakfast in bed,
p52
aVand then, in an old track suit and slippers,
p53
aVhe would go for a walk around the garden.
p54
aVAt night, I would sit with my family
p55
aVaround the snowy, bunny-eared TV,
p56
aVand watch images of that same
p57
aVquiet man from the garden
p58
aVsurrounded by hundreds and thousands of people
p59
aVas scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.
p60
aVHe was bringing peace
p61
aVto a divided and violent South Africa,
p62
aVone man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.
p63
aVMandela said often that the gift of prison
p64
aVwas the ability to go within and to think,
p65
aVto create in himself
p66
aVthe things he most wanted for South Africa:
p67
aVpeace, reconciliation, harmony.
p68
aVThrough this act of immense open-heartedness,
p69
aVhe was to become the embodiment
p70
aVof what in South Africa we call "ubuntu."
p71
aVUbuntu: I am because of you.
p72
aVOr, people are not people
p73
aVwithout other people.
p74
aVIt's not a new idea or value
p75
aVbut it's one that I certainly think at these times
p76
aVis worth building on.
p77
aVIn fact, it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa,
p78
aVwe get to experience the deepest parts
p79
aVof our own humanity
p80
aVthrough our interactions with others.
p81
aVUbuntu is at play right now.
p82
aVYou are holding a space for me
p83
aVto express the deepest truth of who I am.
p84
aVWithout you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room,
p85
aVand I spent a lot of time last week doing that,
p86
aVand it's not the same as this.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VIf Mandela was the national and international embodiment,
p90
aVthen the man who taught me the most
p91
aVabout this value personally was this man,
p92
aVSolly Mhlongo.
p93
aVSolly was born under a tree
p94
aV60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.
p95
aVHe would never have a lot of money,
p96
aVbut he was to be
p97
aVone of the richest men I would ever meet.
p98
aVSolly grew up tending to his father's cattle.
p99
aVNow, I can tell you, I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle,
p100
aVbut it makes for über-resourcefulness.
p101
aVThe first job that he ever got in the safari business
p102
aVwas fixing the safari trucks.
p103
aVWhere he had learned to do that out in the bush
p104
aVI have no idea, but he could do it.
p105
aVHe then moved across into what we called
p106
aVthe habitat team.
p107
aVThese were the people on the reserve
p108
aVwho were responsible for its well-being.
p109
aVHe fixed roads, he mended wetlands,
p110
aVhe did some anti-poaching.
p111
aVAnd then one day we were out together,
p112
aVand he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked.
p113
aVAnd it was an old track,
p114
aVbut for fun he turned and he began to follow it,
p115
aVand I tell you, I could tell by the speed
p116
aVat which he moved on those pad marks
p117
aVthat this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.
p118
aVIf you drove past Solly
p119
aVsomewhere out on the reserve,
p120
aVyou look up in your rearview mirror,
p121
aVyou'd see he'd stopped the car
p122
aV20, 50 meters down the road
p123
aVjust in case you need help with something.
p124
aVThe only accusation I ever heard leveled at him
p125
aVwas when one of our clients said,
p126
aV"Solly, you are pathologically helpful."
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VWhen I started professionally guiding people
p130
aVout into this environment,
p131
aVSolly was my tracker.
p132
aVWe worked together as a team.
p133
aVAnd the first guests we ever got
p134
aVwere a philanthropy group from your East Coast,
p135
aVand they said to Solly, on the side, they said,
p136
aV"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,
p137
aVwe want to see where you live."
p138
aVSo we took them up to his house,
p139
aVand this visit of the philanthropist to his house
p140
aVcoincided with a time when Solly's wife,
p141
aVwho was learning English,
p142
aVwas going through a phase where she would open the door
p143
aVby saying, "Hello, I love you.
p144
aVWelcome, I love you." (Laughter)
p145
aVAnd there was something so beautifully African
p146
aVabout it to me, this small house
p147
aVwith a huge heart in it.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow on the day that Solly saved my life,
p150
aVhe was already my hero.
p151
aVIt was a hot day,
p152
aVand we found ourselves down by the river.
p153
aVBecause of the heat, I took my shoes off,
p154
aVand I rolled up my pants,
p155
aVand I walked into the water.
p156
aVSolly remained on the bank.
p157
aVThe water was clear running over sand,
p158
aVand we turned and we began to make our way upstream.
p159
aVAnd a few meters ahead of us,
p160
aVthere was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank,
p161
aVand its branches were touching the water,
p162
aVand it was shadowy.
p163
aVAnd if had been a horror movie,
p164
aVpeople in the audience would have started saying,
p165
aV"Don't go in there. Don't go in there." (Laughter)
p166
aVAnd of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.
p167
aVNow the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you
p168
aVis the ferocity of the bite.
p169
aVWham! It hits me by my right leg.
p170
aVIt pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch.
p171
aVIt's shaking me violently.
p172
aVIt's a very strange sensation
p173
aVhaving another creature try and eat you,
p174
aVand there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVSolly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.
p177
aVHe turns. He begins to make his way to me.
p178
aVThe croc again continues to shake me.
p179
aVIt goes to bite me a second time.
p180
aVI notice a slick of blood in the water around me
p181
aVthat gets washed downstream.
p182
aVAs it bites the second time, I kick.
p183
aVMy foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.
p184
aVI pull myself up into the branches,
p185
aVand as I come out of the water, I look over my shoulder.
p186
aVMy leg from the knee down
p187
aVis mangled beyond description.
p188
aVThe bone is cracked.
p189
aVThe meat is torn up.
p190
aVI make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again.
p191
aVAs I come out of the water,
p192
aVSolly arrives at a deep section,
p193
aVa channel between us.
p194
aVHe knows, he sees the state of my leg,
p195
aVhe knows that between him and I
p196
aVthere is a crocodile,
p197
aVand I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second.
p198
aVHe comes straight into the channel.
p199
aVHe wades in to above his waist.
p200
aVHe gets to me. He grabs me.
p201
aVI'm still in a vulnerable position.
p202
aVHe picks me and puts me on his shoulder.
p203
aVThis is the other thing about Solly, he's freakishly strong.
p204
aVHe turns. He walks me up the bank.
p205
aVHe lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.
p206
aVHe wraps it around my leg,
p207
aVpicks me up a second time,
p208
aVwalks me to a vehicle,
p209
aVand he's able to get me to medical attention.
p210
aVAnd I survive.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow \u2014 (Applause)
p213
aa(lp214
VNow I don't know how many people you know
p215
aVthat go into a deep channel of water
p216
aVthat they know has a crocodile in it
p217
aVto come and help you,
p218
aVbut for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.
p219
aVAnd he is one amazing example
p220
aVof what I have experienced all over Africa.
p221
aVIn a more collective society,
p222
aVwe realize from the inside
p223
aVthat our own well-being is deeply tied
p224
aVto the well-being of others.
p225
aVDanger is shared. Pain is shared.
p226
aVJoy is shared. Achievement is shared.
p227
aVHouses are shared. Food is shared.
p228
aVUbuntu asks us to open our hearts
p229
aVand to share,
p230
aVand what Solly taught me that day
p231
aVis the essence of this value,
p232
aVhis animated, empathetic action
p233
aVin every moment.
p234
aa(lp235
VNow although the root word is about people,
p236
aVI thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.
p237
aVAnd then I met this young lady.
p238
aVHer name was Elvis.
p239
aVIn fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis
p240
aVbecause he said she walked like she was doing
p241
aVthe Elvis the pelvis dance.
p242
aVShe was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis.
p243
aVShe arrived at our reserve from a reserve
p244
aVeast of us on her migratory route.
p245
aVWhen I first saw her,
p246
aVI thought she would be dead in a matter of days.
p247
aVAnd yet, for the next five years
p248
aVshe returned in the winter months.
p249
aVAnd we would be so excited to be out in the bush
p250
aVand to come across this unusual track.
p251
aVIt looked like an inverted bracket,
p252
aVand we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow,
p253
aVand then we would come around the corner,
p254
aVand there she would be with her herd.
p255
aVAnd that outpouring of emotion
p256
aVfrom people on our safari trucks
p257
aVas they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.
p258
aVAnd it reminded me
p259
aVthat even people who grow up in cities
p260
aVfeel a natural connection
p261
aVwith the natural world and with animals.
p262
aVAnd yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving.
p263
aVAnd then one day we came across them at this small water hole.
p264
aVIt was sort of a hollow in the ground.
p265
aVAnd I watched as the matriarch drank,
p266
aVand then she turned in that  beautiful slow motion of elephants,
p267
aVlooks like the arm in motion,
p268
aVand she began to make her way up the steep bank.
p269
aVThe rest of the herd turned and began to follow.
p270
aVAnd I watched young Elvis
p271
aVbegin to psych herself up for the hill.
p272
aVShe got visibly \u2014 ears came forward,
p273
aVshe had a full go of it and halfway up,
p274
aVher legs gave way, and she fell backwards.
p275
aVShe attempted it a second time,
p276
aVand again, halfway up, she fell backwards.
p277
aVAnd on the third attempt,
p278
aVan amazing thing happened.
p279
aVHalfway up the bank,
p280
aVa young teenage elephant came in behind her,
p281
aVand he propped his trunk underneath her,
p282
aVand he began to shovel her up the bank.
p283
aVAnd it occurred to me
p284
aVthat the rest of the herd
p285
aVwas in fact looking after this young elephant.
p286
aVThe next day I watched again
p287
aVas the matriarch broke a branch
p288
aVand she would put it in her mouth,
p289
aVand then she would break a second one
p290
aVand drop it on the ground.
p291
aVAnd a consensus developed between all of us
p292
aVwho were guiding people in that area
p293
aVthat that herd was in fact moving slower
p294
aVto accommodate that elephant.
p295
aa(lp296
VWhat Elvis and the herd taught me
p297
aVcaused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,
p298
aVand I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,
p299
aVwe get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves
p300
aVreflected back at us.
p301
aVAnd it is not only through other people
p302
aVthat we get to experience our humanity
p303
aVbut through all the creatures that live on this planet.
p304
aVIf Africa has a gift to share,
p305
aVit's a gift of a more collective society.
p306
aVAnd while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea,
p307
aVwhat I see is the essence of that value
p308
aVbeing invented here.
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
VPat Mitchell: So Boyd,
p315
aVwe know that you knew President Mandela
p316
aVfrom early childhood
p317
aVand that you heard the news as we all did today,
p318
aVand deeply distraught
p319
aVand know the tragic loss that it is to the world.
p320
aVBut I just wondered if you wanted
p321
aVto share any additional thoughts,
p322
aVbecause we know that you heard that news
p323
aVjust before coming in to do this session.
p324
aa(lp325
VBoyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.
p326
aVI'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.
p327
aVHe was suffering.
p328
aVAnd so of course there's the mixed emotions.
p329
aVBut I just think of so many occurrences
p330
aVlike the time he went on the Oprah show
p331
aVand asked her what the show would be about.
p332
aV(Laughter)
p333
aVAnd she was like, "Well, it'll be about you."
p334
aVI mean, that's just incredible humility.
p335
aV(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VHe was the father of our nation
p338
aVand we've got a road to walk in South Africa.
p339
aVAnd everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.
p340
aVYou know, he used to go to a rugby match and we would win.
p341
aVAnywhere he went, things went well.
p342
aVBut I think that magic will be with us,
p343
aVand the important thing is that we carry
p344
aVwhat he stood for.
p345
aVAnd so that's what I'm going to try and do,
p346
aVand that's what people all over  South Africa are trying to do.
p347
aa(lp348
VPM: And that's what you've done today. BV: Oh, thank you.
p349
aa(lp350
VPM: Thank you. BV: Thank you. Thanks very much.

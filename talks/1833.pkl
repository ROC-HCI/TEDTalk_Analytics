VSo my name is Amy Webb,
p5
aVand a few years ago I found myself at the end
p6
aVof yet another fantastic relationship
p7
aVthat came burning down in a spectacular fashion.
p8
aVAnd I thought, what's wrong with me?
p9
aVI don't understand why this keeps happening.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo I asked everybody in my life what they thought.
p12
aVI turned to my grandmother, who always had plenty of advice,
p13
aVand she said, "Stop being so picky.
p14
aVYou've got to date around.
p15
aVAnd most importantly,
p16
aVtrue love will find you when you least expect it."
p17
aa(lp18
VNow as it turns out,
p19
aVI'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,
p20
aVas you'll soon find.
p21
aVI am constantly swimming in numbers, formulas and charts.
p22
aVI also have a very tight-knit family,
p23
aVand I'm very, very close with my sister,
p24
aVand as a result, I wanted to have the same type of family when I grew up.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo I'm at the end of this bad breakup,
p27
aVI'm 30 years old,
p28
aVI figure I'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months
p29
aVbefore I'm ready to get monogamous
p30
aVand before we can sort of cohabitate,
p31
aVand we have to do that for a while before we can get engaged.
p32
aVAnd if I want to start having children by the time I'm 35,
p33
aVthat meant that I would have had to have been on my way to marriage
p34
aVfive years ago.
p35
aVSo that wasn't going to work.
p36
aa(lp37
VIf my strategy was to least-expect my way into true love,
p38
aVthen the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity.
p39
aVIn short, I was trying to figure out
p40
aVwhat's the probability of my finding Mr. Right?
p41
aVWell, at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia,
p42
aVand it's a big city, and I figured,
p43
aVin this entire place, there are lots of possibilities.
p44
aVSo again, I started doing some math.
p45
aVPopulation of Philadelphia: it has 1.5 million people.
p46
aVI figure about half of that are men,
p47
aVso that takes the number down to 750,000.
p48
aVI'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36,
p49
aVwhich was only four percent of the population,
p50
aVso now I'm dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men.
p51
aVI was looking for somebody who was Jewish,
p52
aVbecause I am and that was important to me.
p53
aVThat's only 2.3 percent of the population.
p54
aVI figure I'm attracted to maybe one out of 10 of those men,
p55
aVand there was no way I was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer.
p56
aVSo that basically meant there were 35 men for me
p57
aVthat I could possibly date
p58
aVin the entire city of Philadelphia.
p59
aa(lp60
VIn the meantime, my very large Jewish family
p61
aVwas already all married and well on their way
p62
aVto having lots and lots of children,
p63
aVand I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure
p64
aVto get my life going already.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I have two possible strategies at this point
p67
aVI'm sort of figuring out.
p68
aVOne, I can take my grandmother's advice
p69
aVand sort of least-expect my way
p70
aVinto maybe bumping into the one out of 35 possible men
p71
aVin the entire 1.5-million-person city of Philadelphia,
p72
aVor I could try online dating.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, I like the idea of online dating,
p75
aVbecause it's predicated on an algorithm,
p76
aVand that's really just a simple way of saying
p77
aVI've got a problem, I'm going to use some data,
p78
aVrun it through a system and get to a solution.
p79
aVSo online dating is the second most popular way
p80
aVthat people now meet each other,
p81
aVbut as it turns out, algorithms have been around
p82
aVfor thousands of years in almost every culture.
p83
aVIn fact, in Judaism, there were matchmakers a long time ago,
p84
aVand though they didn't have an explicit algorithm per se,
p85
aVthey definitely were running through formulas in their heads,
p86
aVlike, is the girl going to like the boy?
p87
aVAre the families going to get along?
p88
aVWhat's the rabbi going to say?
p89
aVAre they going to start having children right away?
p90
aVThe matchmaker would sort of think through all of this,
p91
aVput two people together, and that would be the end of it.
p92
aVSo in my case, I thought,
p93
aVwell, will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming?
p94
aVSo I decided to sign on.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow, there was one small catch.
p97
aVAs I'm signing on to the various dating websites,
p98
aVas it happens, I was really, really busy.
p99
aVBut that actually wasn't the biggest problem.
p100
aVThe biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind,
p101
aVand I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes.
p102
aVSo I just copied and pasted from my résumé.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VSo in the descriptive part up top,
p107
aVI said that I was an award-winning journalist
p108
aVand a future thinker.
p109
aVWhen I was asked about fun activities and my ideal date,
p110
aVI said monetization and fluency in Japanese.
p111
aVI talked a lot about JavaScript.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VSo obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward.
p116
aVBut the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date.
p117
aVThese algorithms had a sea full of men
p118
aVthat wanted to take me out on lots of dates \u2014
p119
aVwhat turned out to be truly awful dates.
p120
aa(lp121
VThere was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.
p122
aVThe algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets,
p123
aVwe share a love of math and data and '80s music,
p124
aVand so I agreed to go out with him.
p125
aVSo Steve the I.T. guy invited me out
p126
aVto one of Philadelphia's white-table-cloth,
p127
aVextremely expensive restaurants.
p128
aVAnd we went in, and right off the bat,
p129
aVour conversation really wasn't taking flight,
p130
aVbut he was ordering a lot of food.
p131
aVIn fact, he didn't even bother looking at the menu.
p132
aVHe was ordering multiple appetizers, multiple entrées, for me as well,
p133
aVand suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table,
p134
aValso lots and lots of bottles of wine.
p135
aVSo we're nearing the end of our conversation
p136
aVand the end of dinner, and I've decided
p137
aVSteve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other,
p138
aVbut we'll part ways as friends,
p139
aVwhen he gets up to go to the bathroom,
p140
aVand in the meantime, the bill comes to our table.
p141
aVAnd listen, I'm a modern woman.
p142
aVI am totally down with splitting the bill.
p143
aVBut then Steve the I.T. guy didn't come back.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Gasping)
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd that was my entire month's rent.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Audience gasps)
p150
aa(lp151
VSo needless to say, I was not having a good night.
p152
aVSo I run home, I call my mother, I call my sister,
p153
aVand as I do, at the end of each one of these terrible, terrible dates,
p154
aVI regale them with the details.
p155
aVAnd they say to me,
p156
aV"Stop complaining."
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
V"You're just being too picky."
p161
aa(lp162
VSo I said, fine, from here on out I'm only going on dates
p163
aVwhere I know there's Wi-Fi, and I'm bringing my laptop.
p164
aVI'm going to shove it into my bag,
p165
aVI'm going to have this email template,
p166
aVand I'm going to fill it out and collect information
p167
aVon all these different data points during the date
p168
aVto prove to everybody that empirically,
p169
aVthese dates really are terrible.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VSo I started tracking things like really stupid, awkward, sexual remarks;
p174
aVbad vocabulary;
p175
aVthe number of times a man forced me to high-five him.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VSo I started to crunch some numbers,
p180
aVand that allowed me to make some correlations.
p181
aVSo as it turns out,
p182
aVfor some reason, men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VWell, it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys.
p187
aVThere were just bad for me.
p188
aVAnd as it happens, the algorithms that were setting us up,
p189
aVthey weren't bad either.
p190
aVThese algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do,
p191
aVwhich was to take our user-generated information,
p192
aVin my case, my résumé,
p193
aVand match it up with other people's information.
p194
aVSee, the real problem here is that,
p195
aVwhile the algorithms work just fine,
p196
aVyou and I don't,
p197
aVwhen confronted with blank windows
p198
aVwhere we're supposed to input our information online.
p199
aVVery few of us have the ability
p200
aVto be totally and brutally honest with ourselves.
p201
aVThe other problem is that these websites are asking us
p202
aVquestions like, are you a dog person or a cat person?
p203
aVDo you like horror films or romance films?
p204
aVI'm not looking for a pen pal.
p205
aVI'm looking for a husband. Right?
p206
aVSo there's a certain amount of superficiality in that data.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo I said fine, I've got a new plan.
p209
aVI'm going to keep using these online dating sites,
p210
aVbut I'm going to treat them as databases,
p211
aVand rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up,
p212
aVI think I'm going to try reverse-engineering this entire system.
p213
aVSo knowing that there was superficial data
p214
aVthat was being used to match me up with other people,
p215
aVI decided instead to ask my own questions.
p216
aVWhat was every single possible thing
p217
aVthat I could think of that I was looking for in a mate?
p218
aa(lp219
VSo I started writing
p220
aVand writing and writing,
p221
aVand at the end, I had amassed 72 different data points.
p222
aVI wanted somebody was Jew-ish,
p223
aVso I was looking for somebody
p224
aVwho had the same background and thoughts on our culture,
p225
aVbut wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday.
p226
aVI wanted somebody who worked hard,
p227
aVbecause work for me is extremely important,
p228
aVbut not too hard.
p229
aVFor me, the hobbies that I have
p230
aVare really just new work projects that I've launched.
p231
aVI also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children,
p232
aVbut was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do,
p233
aVso somebody who was going to be totally okay
p234
aVwith forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three,
p235
aVand also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it.
p236
aVSo things like that, but I also wanted somebody
p237
aVwho would go to far-flung, exotic places, like Petra, Jordan.
p238
aVI also wanted somebody who would weigh 20 pounds more than me at all times,
p239
aVregardless of what I weighed.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VSo I now have these 72 different data points,
p244
aVwhich, to be fair, is a lot.
p245
aVSo what I did was, I went through and I prioritized that list.
p246
aVI broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points,
p247
aVand I ranked everything starting at 100
p248
aVand going all the way down to 91,
p249
aVand listing things like I was looking for somebody who was really smart,
p250
aVwho would challenge and stimulate me,
p251
aVand balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points.
p252
aVThese things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VSo once I had all this done, I then built a scoring system,
p257
aVbecause what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate
p258
aVwhether or not I thought the guy that I found online
p259
aVwould be a match with me.
p260
aVI figured there would be a minimum of 700 points
p261
aVbefore I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message.
p262
aVFor 900 points, I'd agree to go out on a date,
p263
aVand I wouldn't even consider any kind of relationship
p264
aVbefore somebody had crossed the 1,500 point threshold.
p265
aa(lp266
VWell, as it turns out, this worked pretty well.
p267
aVSo I go back online now.
p268
aVI found Jewishdoc57
p269
aVwho's incredibly good-looking, incredibly well-spoken,
p270
aVhe had hiked Mt. Fuji,
p271
aVhe had walked along the Great Wall.
p272
aVHe likes to travel
p273
aVas long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship.
p274
aVAnd I thought,
p275
aVI've done it!
p276
aVI've cracked the code.
p277
aVI have just found the Jewish Prince Charming
p278
aVof my family's dreams.
p279
aa(lp280
VThere was only one problem:
p281
aVHe didn't like me back.
p282
aVAnd I guess the one variable that I haven't considered
p283
aVis the competition.
p284
aVWho are all of the other women on these dating sites?
p285
aVI found SmileyGirl1978.
p286
aVShe said she was a "Fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing."
p287
aVShe listed her job as "teacher."
p288
aVShe said she is "silly, nice and friendly."
p289
aVShe likes to make people laugh "alot."
p290
aa(lp291
VAt this moment I knew,
p292
aVclicking profile after profile that looked like this,
p293
aVthat I needed to do some market research.
p294
aVSo I created 10 fake male profiles.
p295
aVNow, before I lose all of you \u2014
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter) \u2014
p298
aa(lp299
Vunderstand that I did this strictly to gather data
p300
aVabout everybody else in the system.
p301
aVI didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody.
p302
aVI really was just scraping their data.
p303
aVBut I didn't want everybody's data.
p304
aVI only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted
p305
aVto the type of man that I really, really wanted to marry.
p306
aa(lp307
VWhen I released these men into the wild,
p308
aVI did follow some rules.
p309
aVSo I didn't reach out to any woman first.
p310
aVI just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract,
p311
aVand mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets.
p312
aVSo I was looking at qualitative data,
p313
aVso what was the humor, the tone,
p314
aVthe voice, the communication style
p315
aVthat these women shared in common?
p316
aVAnd also quantitative data,
p317
aVso what was the average length of their profile,
p318
aVhow much time was spent between messages?
p319
aVWhat I was trying to get at here was that I figured, in person,
p320
aVI would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl1978.
p321
aVI wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online.
p322
aa(lp323
VWell, one month later,
p324
aVI had a lot of data, and I was able to do another analysis.
p325
aVAnd as it turns out, content matters a lot.
p326
aVSo smart people tend to write a lot \u2014
p327
aV3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words about themselves,
p328
aVwhich may all be very, very interesting.
p329
aVThe challenge here, though, is that the popular men and women
p330
aVare sticking to 97 words on average
p331
aVthat are written very, very well,
p332
aVeven though it may not seem like it all the time.
p333
aVThe other hallmark of the people who do this well
p334
aVis that they're using non-specific language.
p335
aVSo in my case,
p336
aV"The English Patient" is my most favorite movie ever,
p337
aVbut it doesn't work to use that in a profile,
p338
aVbecause that's a superficial data point,
p339
aVand somebody may disagree
p340
aVand decide they don't want to go out
p341
aVbecause they didn't like sitting through the three-hour movie.
p342
aa(lp343
VAlso, optimistic language matters a lot.
p344
aVSo this is a word cloud
p345
aVhighlighting the most popular words that were used
p346
aVby the most popular women,
p347
aVwords like "fun" and "girl" and "love."
p348
aVAnd what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile.
p349
aVRemember, I'm somebody who said
p350
aVthat I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript
p351
aVand I was okay with that.
p352
aVThe difference is that it's about being more approachable
p353
aVand helping people understand the best way to reach out to you.
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd as it turns out, timing is also really, really important.
p356
aVJust because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number
p357
aVor their instant message account
p358
aVand it's 2 o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake,
p359
aVdoesn't mean that that's a good time to communicate with those people.
p360
aVThe popular women on these online sites
p361
aVspend an average of 23 hours in between each communication.
p362
aVAnd that's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship.
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd finally \u2014
p365
aVthere were the photos.
p366
aVAll of the women who were popular showed some skin.
p367
aVThey all looked really great,
p368
aVwhich turned out to be in sharp contrast
p369
aVto what I had uploaded.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
VOnce I had all of this information,
p374
aVI was able to create a super profile,
p375
aVso it was still me,
p376
aVbut it was me optimized now for this ecosystem.
p377
aVAnd as it turns out, I did a really good job.
p378
aVI was the most popular person online.
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
V(Applause)
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd as it turns out, lots and lots of men wanted to date me.
p385
aVSo I call my mom, I call my sister, I call my grandmother.
p386
aVI'm telling them about this fabulous news,
p387
aVand they say, "This is wonderful! How soon are you going out?"
p388
aVI said, "Actually, I'm not going to go out with anybody."
p389
aVBecause remember, in my scoring system,
p390
aVthey have to reach a minimum threshold of 700 points,
p391
aVand none of them have done that.
p392
aVThey said, "What? You're still being too damn picky."
p393
aa(lp394
VWell, not too long after that, I found this guy, Thevenin,
p395
aVand he said that he was culturally Jewish,
p396
aVhe said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter,
p397
aVwhich I thought was very clever.
p398
aVHe talked in detail about travel.
p399
aVHe made a lot of really interesting cultural references.
p400
aVHe looked and talked exactly like what I wanted,
p401
aVand immediately, he scored 850 points.
p402
aVIt was enough for a date.
p403
aa(lp404
VThree weeks later, we met up in person
p405
aVfor what turned out to be a 14-hour-long conversation
p406
aVthat went from coffee shop to restaurant
p407
aVto another coffee shop to another restaurant,
p408
aVand when he dropped me back off at my house that night
p409
aVI re-scored him \u2014
p410
aa(lp411
V[1,050 points!]
p412
aa(lp413
VThought, you know what,
p414
aVthis entire time, I haven't been picky enough.
p415
aVWell, a year and a half after that,
p416
aVwe were non-cruise ship traveling
p417
aVthrough Petra, Jordan,
p418
aVwhen he got down on his knee and proposed.
p419
aVA year after that, we were married,
p420
aVand about a year and a half after that,
p421
aVour daughter, Petra, was born.
p422
aa(lp423
VAudience: Oh!
p424
aa(lp425
V(Applause)
p426
aa(lp427
V[What it means...]
p428
aa(lp429
VObviously, I'm having a fabulous life, so \u2014
p430
aa(lp431
V(Laughter)
p432
aa(lp433
VThe question is, what does all of this mean for you?
p434
aa(lp435
VWell, as it turns out, there is an algorithm for love.
p436
aVIt's just not the ones that we're being presented with online.
p437
aVIn fact, it's something that you write yourself.
p438
aVSo whether you're looking for a husband or a wife
p439
aVor you're trying to find your passion
p440
aVor you're trying to start a business,
p441
aVall you have to really do is figure out your own framework
p442
aVand play by your own rules,
p443
aVand feel free to be as picky as you want.
p444
aa(lp445
VWell, on my wedding day,
p446
aVI had a conversation again with my grandmother,
p447
aVand she said, "All right, maybe I was wrong.
p448
aVIt looks like you did come up with a really, really great system.
p449
aVNow, your matzah balls ...
p450
aVThey should be fluffy, not hard."
p451
aa(lp452
V(Laughter)
p453
aa(lp454
VAnd I'll take her advice on that.
p455

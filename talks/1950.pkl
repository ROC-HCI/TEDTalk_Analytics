VChris Anderson: The rights of citizens,
p5
aVthe future of the Internet.
p6
aVSo I would like to welcome to the TED stage
p7
aVthe man behind those revelations,
p8
aVEd Snowden.
p9
aV(Applause)
p10
aVEd is in a remote location somewhere in Russia
p11
aVcontrolling this bot from his laptop,
p12
aVso he can see what the bot can see.
p13
aVEd, welcome to the TED stage.
p14
aVWhat can you see, as a matter of fact?
p15
aa(lp16
VEdward Snowden: Ha, I can see everyone.
p17
aVThis is amazing.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VCA: Ed, some questions for you.
p21
aVYou've been called many things
p22
aVin the last few months.
p23
aVYou've been called a whistleblower, a traitor,
p24
aVa hero.
p25
aVWhat words would you describe yourself with?
p26
aa(lp27
VES: You know, everybody who is involved
p28
aVwith this debate
p29
aVhas been struggling over me and my personality
p30
aVand how to describe me.
p31
aVBut when I think about it,
p32
aVthis isn't the question that we should be struggling with.
p33
aVWho I am really doesn't matter at all.
p34
aVIf I'm the worst person in the world,
p35
aVyou can hate me and move on.
p36
aVWhat really matters here are the issues.
p37
aVWhat really matters here is the kind of government we want,
p38
aVthe kind of Internet we want,
p39
aVthe kind of relationship between people
p40
aVand societies.
p41
aVAnd that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards,
p42
aVand we've seen that increasing over time.
p43
aVIf I had to describe myself,
p44
aVI wouldn't use words like "hero."
p45
aVI wouldn't use "patriot," and I wouldn't use "traitor."
p46
aVI'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen,
p47
aVjust like everyone else.
p48
aa(lp49
VCA: So just to give some context
p50
aVfor those who don't know the whole story \u2014
p51
aV(Applause) \u2014
p52
aVthis time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii
p53
aVworking as a consultant to the NSA.
p54
aVAs a sysadmin, you had access
p55
aVto their systems,
p56
aVand you began revealing certain classified documents
p57
aVto some handpicked journalists
p58
aVleading the way to June's revelations.
p59
aVNow, what propelled you to do this?
p60
aVES: You know,
p61
aVwhen I was sitting in Hawaii,
p62
aVand the years before, when I was working in the intelligence community,
p63
aVI saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.
p64
aVWe do a lot of good things in the intelligence community,
p65
aVthings that need to be done,
p66
aVand things that help everyone.
p67
aVBut there are also things that go too far.
p68
aVThere are things that shouldn't be done,
p69
aVand decisions that were being made in secret
p70
aVwithout the public's awareness,
p71
aVwithout the public's consent,
p72
aVand without even our representatives in government
p73
aVhaving knowledge of these programs.
p74
aVWhen I really came to struggle with these issues,
p75
aVI thought to myself,
p76
aVhow can I do this in the most responsible way,
p77
aVthat maximizes the public benefit
p78
aVwhile minimizing the risks?
p79
aVAnd out of all the solutions that I could come up with,
p80
aVout of going to Congress,
p81
aVwhen there were no laws,
p82
aVthere were no legal protections
p83
aVfor a private employee,
p84
aVa contractor in intelligence like myself,
p85
aVthere was a risk that I would be buried along with the information
p86
aVand the public would never find out.
p87
aVBut the First Amendment of the United States Constitution
p88
aVguarantees us a free press for a reason,
p89
aVand that's to enable an adversarial press,
p90
aVto challenge the government,
p91
aVbut also to work together with the government,
p92
aVto have a dialogue and debate about how we can
p93
aVinform the public about matters of vital importance
p94
aVwithout putting our national security at risk.
p95
aVAnd by working with journalists,
p96
aVby giving all of my information
p97
aVback to the American people,
p98
aVrather than trusting myself to make
p99
aVthe decisions about publication,
p100
aVwe've had a robust debate
p101
aVwith a deep investment by the government
p102
aVthat I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.
p103
aVAnd the risks that have been threatened,
p104
aVthe risks that have been played up
p105
aVby the government
p106
aVhave never materialized.
p107
aVWe've never seen any evidence
p108
aVof even a single instance of specific harm,
p109
aVand because of that,
p110
aVI'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.
p111
aa(lp112
VCA: So let me show the audience
p113
aVa couple of examples of what you revealed.
p114
aVIf we could have a slide up, and Ed,
p115
aVI don't know whether you can see,
p116
aVthe slides are here.
p117
aVThis is a slide of the PRISM program,
p118
aVand maybe you could tell the audience
p119
aVwhat that was that was revealed.
p120
aa(lp121
VES: The best way to understand PRISM,
p122
aVbecause there's been a little bit of controversy,
p123
aVis to first talk about what PRISM isn't.
p124
aVMuch of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata.
p125
aVThey've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,
p126
aVand they're talking about a specific legal authority
p127
aVcalled Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
p128
aVThat allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,
p129
aVmass surveillance of the entire country's
p130
aVphone records, things like that \u2014
p131
aVwho you're talking to,
p132
aVwhen you're talking to them,
p133
aVwhere you traveled.
p134
aVThese are all metadata events.
p135
aVPRISM is about content.
p136
aVIt's a program through which the government could
p137
aVcompel corporate America,
p138
aVit could deputize corporate America
p139
aVto do its dirty work for the NSA.
p140
aVAnd even though some of these companies did resist,
p141
aVeven though some of them \u2014
p142
aVI believe Yahoo was one of them \u2014
p143
aVchallenged them in court, they all lost,
p144
aVbecause it was never tried by an open court.
p145
aVThey were only tried by a secret court.
p146
aVAnd something that we've seen,
p147
aVsomething about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is,
p148
aVthere's been a talking point in the U.S. government
p149
aVwhere they've said 15 federal judges
p150
aVhave reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful,
p151
aVbut what they don't tell you
p152
aVis those are secret judges
p153
aVin a secret court
p154
aVbased on secret interpretations of law
p155
aVthat's considered 34,000 warrant requests
p156
aVover 33 years,
p157
aVand in 33 years only rejected
p158
aV11 government requests.
p159
aVThese aren't the people that we want deciding
p160
aVwhat the role of corporate America
p161
aVin a free and open Internet should be.
p162
aa(lp163
VCA: Now, this slide that we're showing here
p164
aVshows the dates in which
p165
aVdifferent technology companies, Internet companies,
p166
aVare alleged to have joined the program,
p167
aVand where data collection began from them.
p168
aVNow, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.
p169
aVHow was that data collected by the NSA?
p170
aa(lp171
VES: Right. So the NSA's own slides
p172
aVrefer to it as direct access.
p173
aVWhat that means to an actual NSA analyst,
p174
aVsomeone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst
p175
aVtargeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,
p176
aVthings like that, in Hawaii,
p177
aVis the provenance of that data
p178
aVis directly from their servers.
p179
aVIt doesn't mean
p180
aVthat there's a group of company representatives
p181
aVsitting in a smoky room with the NSA
p182
aVpalling around and making back-room deals
p183
aVabout how they're going to give this stuff away.
p184
aVNow each company handles it different ways.
p185
aVSome are responsible.
p186
aVSome are somewhat less responsible.
p187
aVBut the bottom line is, when we talk about
p188
aVhow this information is given,
p189
aVit's coming from the companies themselves.
p190
aVIt's not stolen from the lines.
p191
aVBut there's an important thing to remember here:
p192
aVeven though companies pushed back,
p193
aVeven though companies demanded,
p194
aVhey, let's do this through a warrant process,
p195
aVlet's do this
p196
aVwhere we actually have some sort of legal review,
p197
aVsome sort of basis for handing over
p198
aVthese users' data,
p199
aVwe saw stories in the Washington Post last year
p200
aVthat weren't as well reported as the PRISM story
p201
aVthat said the NSA broke in
p202
aVto the data center communications
p203
aVbetween Google to itself
p204
aVand Yahoo to itself.
p205
aVSo even these companies that are cooperating
p206
aVin at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner
p207
aVwith the NSA,
p208
aVthe NSA isn't satisfied with that,
p209
aVand because of that, we need our companies
p210
aVto work very hard
p211
aVto guarantee that they're going to represent
p212
aVthe interests of the user, and also advocate
p213
aVfor the rights of the users.
p214
aVAnd I think over the last year,
p215
aVwe've seen the companies that are named
p216
aVon the PRISM slides
p217
aVtake great strides to do that,
p218
aVand I encourage them to continue.
p219
aa(lp220
VCA: What more should they do?
p221
aa(lp222
VES: The biggest thing that an Internet company
p223
aVin America can do today, right now,
p224
aVwithout consulting with lawyers,
p225
aVto protect the rights of users worldwide,
p226
aVis to enable SSL web encryption
p227
aVon every page you visit.
p228
aVThe reason this matters is today,
p229
aVif you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com,
p230
aVthe NSA can see a record of that,
p231
aVthe Russian intelligence service can see a record of that,
p232
aVthe Chinese service can see a record of that,
p233
aVthe French service, the German service,
p234
aVthe services of Andorra.
p235
aVThey can all see it because it's unencrypted.
p236
aVThe world's library is Amazon.com,
p237
aVbut not only do they not support encryption by default,
p238
aVyou cannot choose to use encryption
p239
aVwhen browsing through books.
p240
aVThis is something that we need to change,
p241
aVnot just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out,
p242
aVbut they're a great example.
p243
aVAll companies need to move
p244
aVto an encrypted browsing habit by default
p245
aVfor all users who haven't taken any action
p246
aVor picked any special methods on their own.
p247
aVThat'll increase the privacy and the rights
p248
aVthat people enjoy worldwide.
p249
aa(lp250
VCA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.
p251
aVI want to show you the next slide here. (Applause)
p252
aVThis is a program called Boundless Informant.
p253
aVWhat is that?
p254
aa(lp255
VES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA
p256
aVfor using appropriate names on this.
p257
aVThis is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.
p258
aVBoundless Informant
p259
aVis a program that the NSA hid from Congress.
p260
aVThe NSA was previously asked by Congress,
p261
aVwas there any ability that they had
p262
aVto even give a rough ballpark estimate
p263
aVof the amount of American communications
p264
aVthat were being intercepted.
p265
aVThey said no. They said, we don't track those stats,
p266
aVand we can't track those stats.
p267
aVWe can't tell you how many communications
p268
aVwe're intercepting around the world,
p269
aVbecause to tell you that would be
p270
aVto invade your privacy.
p271
aVNow, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,
p272
aVbut the reality, when you look at this slide is,
p273
aVnot only do they have the capability,
p274
aVthe capability already exists.
p275
aVIt's already in place.
p276
aVThe NSA has its own internal data format
p277
aVthat tracks both ends of a communication,
p278
aVand if it says,
p279
aVthis communication came from America,
p280
aVthey can tell Congress how many of those communications
p281
aVthey have today, right now.
p282
aVAnd what Boundless Informant tells us
p283
aVis more communications are being intercepted
p284
aVin America about Americans
p285
aVthan there are in Russia about Russians.
p286
aVI'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency
p287
aVshould be aiming for.
p288
aa(lp289
VCA: Ed, there was a story broken in the Washington Post,
p290
aVagain from your data.
p291
aVThe headline says,
p292
aV"NSA broke privacy rules
p293
aVthousands of times per year."
p294
aVTell us about that.
p295
aa(lp296
VES: We also heard in Congressional testimony last year,
p297
aVit was an amazing thing for someone like me
p298
aVwho came from the NSA
p299
aVand who's seen the actual internal documents,
p300
aVknows what's in them,
p301
aVto see officials testifying under oath
p302
aVthat there had been no abuses,
p303
aVthat there had been no violations of the NSA's rules,
p304
aVwhen we knew this story was coming.
p305
aVBut what's especially interesting about this,
p306
aVabout the fact that the NSA has violated
p307
aVtheir own rules, their own laws
p308
aVthousands of times in a single year,
p309
aVincluding one event by itself,
p310
aVone event out of those 2,776,
p311
aVthat affected more than 3,000 people.
p312
aVIn another event, they intercepted
p313
aVall the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.
p314
aVWhat's amazing about this,
p315
aVthis report, that didn't get that much attention,
p316
aVis the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,
p317
aVthe chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
p318
aVDianne Feinstein, had not seen this report
p319
aVuntil the Washington Post contacted her
p320
aVasking for comment on the report.
p321
aVAnd she then requested a copy from the NSA
p322
aVand received it,
p323
aVbut had never seen this before that.
p324
aVWhat does that say about the state of oversight
p325
aVin American intelligence
p326
aVwhen the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee
p327
aVhas no idea that the rules are being broken
p328
aVthousands of times every year?
p329
aa(lp330
VCA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:
p331
aVWhy should we care about
p332
aVall this surveillance, honestly?
p333
aVI mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong,
p334
aVyou've got nothing to worry about.
p335
aVWhat's wrong with that point of view?
p336
aVES: Well, so the first thing is,
p337
aVyou're giving up your rights.
p338
aVYou're saying hey, you know,
p339
aVI don't think I'm going to need them,
p340
aVso I'm just going to trust that, you know,
p341
aVlet's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter,
p342
aVthese guys are going to do the right thing.
p343
aVYour rights matter
p344
aVbecause you never know when you're going to need them.
p345
aVBeyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity,
p346
aVnot just in America,
p347
aVbut in Western societies
p348
aVand in democratic societies around the world.
p349
aVPeople should be able to pick up the phone
p350
aVand to call their family,
p351
aVpeople should be able to send a text message
p352
aVto their loved ones,
p353
aVpeople should be able to buy a book online,
p354
aVthey should be able to travel by train,
p355
aVthey should be able to buy an airline ticket
p356
aVwithout wondering about how these events
p357
aVare going to look to an agent of the government,
p358
aVpossibly not even your government
p359
aVyears in the future,
p360
aVhow they're going to be misinterpreted
p361
aVand what they're going to think your intentions were.
p362
aVWe have a right to privacy.
p363
aVWe require warrants to be based on probable cause
p364
aVor some kind of individualized suspicion
p365
aVbecause we recognize that trusting anybody,
p366
aVany government authority,
p367
aVwith the entirety of human communications
p368
aVin secret and without oversight
p369
aVis simply too great a temptation to be ignored.
p370
aa(lp371
VCA: Some people are furious at what you've done.
p372
aVI heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney
p373
aVwho said that Julian Assange was a flea bite,
p374
aVEdward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog.
p375
aVHe thinks you've committed
p376
aVone of the worst acts of betrayal
p377
aVin American history.
p378
aVWhat would you say to people who think that?
p379
aa(lp380
VES: Dick Cheney's really something else.
p381
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p382
aVThank you. (Laughter)
p383
aVI think it's amazing, because at the time
p384
aVJulian Assange was doing some of his greatest work,
p385
aVDick Cheney was saying
p386
aVhe was going to end governments worldwide,
p387
aVthe skies were going to ignite
p388
aVand the seas were going to boil off,
p389
aVand now he's saying it's a flea bite.
p390
aVSo we should be suspicious about the same sort of
p391
aVoverblown claims of damage to national security
p392
aVfrom these kind of officials.
p393
aVBut let's assume that these people really believe this.
p394
aVI would argue that they have kind of
p395
aVa narrow conception of national security.
p396
aVThe prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney
p397
aVdo not keep the nation safe.
p398
aVThe public interest is not always the same
p399
aVas the national interest.
p400
aVGoing to war with people who are not our enemy
p401
aVin places that are not a threat
p402
aVdoesn't make us safe,
p403
aVand that applies whether it's in Iraq
p404
aVor on the Internet.
p405
aVThe Internet is not the enemy.
p406
aVOur economy is not the enemy.
p407
aVAmerican businesses, Chinese businesses,
p408
aVand any other company out there
p409
aVis a part of our society.
p410
aVIt's a part of our interconnected world.
p411
aVThere are ties of fraternity that bond us together,
p412
aVand if we destroy these bonds
p413
aVby undermining the standards, the security,
p414
aVthe manner of behavior,
p415
aVthat nations and citizens all around the world
p416
aVexpect us to abide by.
p417
aa(lp418
VCA: But it's alleged that you've stolen
p419
aV1.7 million documents.
p420
aVIt seems only a few hundred of them
p421
aVhave been shared with journalists so far.
p422
aVAre there more revelations to come?
p423
aa(lp424
VES: There are absolutely more revelations to come.
p425
aVI don't think there's any question
p426
aVthat some of the most important reporting
p427
aVto be done is yet to come.
p428
aa(lp429
VCA: Come here, because I want to ask you
p430
aVabout this particular revelation.
p431
aVCome and take a look at this.
p432
aVI mean, this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room
p433
aVis the single most shocking thing
p434
aVthat they have heard in the last few months.
p435
aVIt's about a program called "Bullrun."
p436
aVCan you explain what that is?
p437
aa(lp438
VES: So Bullrun, and this is again
p439
aVwhere we've got to thank the NSA for their candor,
p440
aVthis is a program named after a Civil War battle.
p441
aVThe British counterpart is called Edgehill,
p442
aVwhich is a U.K. civil war battle.
p443
aVAnd the reason that I believe they're named this way
p444
aVis because they target our own infrastructure.
p445
aVThey're programs through which the NSA
p446
aVintentionally misleads corporate partners.
p447
aVThey tell corporate partners that these
p448
aVare safe standards.
p449
aVThey say hey, we need to work with you
p450
aVto secure your systems,
p451
aVbut in reality, they're giving bad advice
p452
aVto these companies that makes them
p453
aVdegrade the security of their services.
p454
aVThey're building in backdoors that not only
p455
aVthe NSA can exploit,
p456
aVbut anyone else who has time and money
p457
aVto research and find it
p458
aVcan then use to let themselves in
p459
aVto the world's communications.
p460
aVAnd this is really dangerous,
p461
aVbecause if we lose a single standard,
p462
aVif we lose the trust of something like SSL,
p463
aVwhich was specifically targeted
p464
aVby the Bullrun program,
p465
aVwe will live a less safe world overall.
p466
aVWe won't be able to access our banks
p467
aVand we won't be able to access commerce
p468
aVwithout worrying about people monitoring those communications
p469
aVor subverting them for their own ends.
p470
aa(lp471
VCA: And do those same decisions also potentially
p472
aVopen America up to cyberattacks
p473
aVfrom other sources?
p474
aa(lp475
VES: Absolutely.
p476
aVOne of the problems,
p477
aVone of the dangerous legacies
p478
aVthat we've seen in the post-9/11 era,
p479
aVis that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.
p480
aVThey've been in charge of offensive operations,
p481
aVthat is hacking,
p482
aVbut they've also been in charge of defensive operations,
p483
aVand traditionally they've always prioritized
p484
aVdefense over offense
p485
aVbased on the principle
p486
aVthat American secrets are simply worth more.
p487
aVIf we hack a Chinese business
p488
aVand steal their secrets,
p489
aVif we hack a government office in Berlin
p490
aVand steal their secrets,
p491
aVthat has less value to the American people
p492
aVthan making sure that the Chinese
p493
aVcan't get access to our secrets.
p494
aVSo by reducing the security of our communications,
p495
aVthey're not only putting the world at risk,
p496
aVthey're putting America at risk in a fundamental way,
p497
aVbecause intellectual property is the basis,
p498
aVthe foundation of our economy,
p499
aVand if we put that at risk through weak security,
p500
aVwe're going to be paying for it for years.
p501
aa(lp502
VCA: But they've made a calculation
p503
aVthat it was worth doing this
p504
aVas part of America's defense against terrorism.
p505
aVSurely that makes it a price worth paying.
p506
aa(lp507
VES: Well, when you look at the results
p508
aVof these programs in stopping terrorism,
p509
aVyou will see that that's unfounded,
p510
aVand you don't have to take my word for it,
p511
aVbecause we've had the first open court,
p512
aVthe first federal court that's reviewed this,
p513
aVoutside the secrecy arrangement,
p514
aVcalled these programs Orwellian
p515
aVand likely unconstitutional.
p516
aVCongress, who has access
p517
aVto be briefed on these things,
p518
aVand now has the desire to be,
p519
aVhas produced bills to reform it,
p520
aVand two independent White House panels
p521
aVwho reviewed all of the classified evidence
p522
aVsaid these programs have never stopped
p523
aVa single terrorist attack
p524
aVthat was imminent in the United States.
p525
aVSo is it really terrorism that we're stopping?
p526
aVDo these programs have any value at all?
p527
aVI say no, and all three branches
p528
aVof the American government say no as well.
p529
aa(lp530
VCA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation
p531
aVfor them than the war against terrorism?
p532
aa(lp533
VES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?
p534
aa(lp535
VCA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation
p536
aVfor them other than the war against terrorism?
p537
aa(lp538
VES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism
p539
aVhas always been what we in the intelligence world
p540
aVwould call a cover for action.
p541
aVTerrorism is something that provokes
p542
aVan emotional response that allows people
p543
aVto rationalize authorizing powers and programs
p544
aVthat they wouldn't give otherwise.
p545
aVThe Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,
p546
aVthe NSA asked for these authorities
p547
aVback in the 1990s.
p548
aVThey asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case.
p549
aVThe FBI went to Congress and did make the case.
p550
aVBut Congress and the American people said no.
p551
aVThey said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.
p552
aVThey said it's worth too much damage
p553
aVto our society to justify the gains.
p554
aVBut what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era,
p555
aVthey used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism
p556
aVto start these programs in secret
p557
aVwithout asking Congress,
p558
aVwithout asking the American people,
p559
aVand it's that kind of government behind closed doors
p560
aVthat we need to guard ourselves against,
p561
aVbecause it makes us less safe,
p562
aVand it offers no value.
p563
aa(lp564
VCA: Okay, come with me here for a sec,
p565
aVbecause I've got a more personal question for you.
p566
aVSpeaking of terror,
p567
aVmost people would find the situation you're in right now
p568
aVin Russia pretty terrifying.
p569
aVYou obviously heard what happened,
p570
aVwhat the treatment that Bradley Manning got,
p571
aVChelsea Manning as now is,
p572
aVand there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that
p573
aVthere are people in the intelligence community
p574
aVwho want you dead.
p575
aVHow are you coping with this?
p576
aVHow are you coping with the fear?
p577
aa(lp578
VES: It's no mystery
p579
aVthat there are governments out there that want to see me dead.
p580
aVI've made clear again and again and again
p581
aVthat I go to sleep every morning
p582
aVthinking about what I can do for the American people.
p583
aVI don't want to harm my government.
p584
aVI want to help my government,
p585
aVbut the fact that they are willing to
p586
aVcompletely ignore due process,
p587
aVthey're willing to declare guilt
p588
aVwithout ever seeing a trial,
p589
aVthese are things that we need to work against
p590
aVas a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate.
p591
aVWe shouldn't be threatening dissidents.
p592
aVWe shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.
p593
aVAnd whatever part I can do to see that end,
p594
aVI'm happy to do despite the risks.
p595
aa(lp596
VCA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback
p597
aVfrom the audience here,
p598
aVbecause I know there's widely differing reactions
p599
aVto Edward Snowden.
p600
aVSuppose you had the following two choices, right?
p601
aVYou could view what he did
p602
aVas fundamentally a reckless act
p603
aVthat has endangered America
p604
aVor you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act
p605
aVthat will work towards America and the world's
p606
aVlong-term good?
p607
aVThose are the two choices I'll give you.
p608
aVI'm curious to see who's willing to vote with
p609
aVthe first of those,
p610
aVthat this was a reckless act?
p611
aVThere are some hands going up.
p612
aVSome hands going up.
p613
aVIt's hard to put your hand up
p614
aVwhen the man is standing right here,
p615
aVbut I see them.
p616
aa(lp617
VES: I can see you. (Laughter)
p618
aa(lp619
VCA: And who goes with the second choice,
p620
aVthe fundamentally heroic act?
p621
aa(lp622
V(Applause) (Cheers)
p623
aa(lp624
VAnd I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people
p625
aVwho didn't show a hand and I think
p626
aVare still thinking this through,
p627
aVbecause it seems to me that the debate around you
p628
aVdoesn't split along traditional political lines.
p629
aVIt's not left or right, it's not really about
p630
aVpro-government, libertarian, or not just that.
p631
aVPart of it is almost a generational issue.
p632
aVYou're part of a generation that grew up
p633
aVwith the Internet, and it seems as if
p634
aVyou become offended at almost a visceral level
p635
aVwhen you see something done
p636
aVthat you think will harm the Internet.
p637
aVIs there some truth to that?
p638
aa(lp639
VES: It is. I think it's very true.
p640
aVThis is not a left or right issue.
p641
aVOur basic freedoms, and when I say our,
p642
aVI don't just mean Americans,
p643
aVI mean people around the world,
p644
aVit's not a partisan issue.
p645
aVThese are things that all people believe,
p646
aVand it's up to all of us to protect them,
p647
aVand to people who have seen and enjoyed
p648
aVa free and open Internet,
p649
aVit's up to us to preserve that liberty
p650
aVfor the next generation to enjoy,
p651
aVand if we don't change things,
p652
aVif we don't stand up to make the changes
p653
aVwe need to do to keep the Internet safe,
p654
aVnot just for us but for everyone,
p655
aVwe're going to lose that,
p656
aVand that would be a tremendous loss,
p657
aVnot just for us, but for the world.
p658
aa(lp659
VCA: Well, I have heard similar language recently
p660
aVfrom the founder of the world wide web,
p661
aVwho I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
p662
aVTim, actually, would you like to come up and say,
p663
aVdo we have a microphone for Tim?
p664
aa(lp665
V(Applause)
p666
aa(lp667
VTim, good to see you. Come up there.
p668
aVWhich camp are you in, by the way,
p669
aVtraitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but \u2014
p670
aa(lp671
VTim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer
p672
aVanswers to that question, but hero,
p673
aVif I have to make the choice between the two.
p674
aa(lp675
VCA: And Ed, I think you've read
p676
aVthe proposal that Sir Tim has talked about
p677
aVabout a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet.
p678
aVIs that something that makes sense?
p679
aVES: Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up
p680
aVnot just thinking about the Internet,
p681
aVbut I grew up in the Internet,
p682
aVand although I never expected to have the chance
p683
aVto defend it in such a direct and practical manner
p684
aVand to embody it in this unusual,
p685
aValmost avatar manner,
p686
aVI think there's something poetic about the fact that
p687
aVone of the sons of the Internet
p688
aVhas actually become close to the Internet
p689
aVas a result of their political expression.
p690
aVAnd I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet
p691
aVis exactly what we need.
p692
aVWe need to encode our values
p693
aVnot just in writing but in the structure of the Internet,
p694
aVand it's something that I hope,
p695
aVI invite everyone in the audience,
p696
aVnot just here in Vancouver but around the world,
p697
aVto join and participate in.
p698
aa(lp699
VCA: Do you have a question for Ed?
p700
aa(lp701
VTBL: Well, two questions,
p702
aVa general question \u2014
p703
aa(lp704
VCA: Ed, can you still hear us?
p705
aa(lp706
VES: Yes, I can hear you. CA: Oh, he's back.
p707
aa(lp708
VTBL: The wiretap on your line
p709
aVgot a little interfered with for a moment.
p710
aV(Laughter)
p711
aa(lp712
VES: It's a little bit of an NSA problem.
p713
aa(lp714
VTBL: So, from the 25 years,
p715
aVstepping back and thinking,
p716
aVwhat would you think would be
p717
aVthe best that we could achieve
p718
aVfrom all the discussions that we have
p719
aVabout the web we want?
p720
aa(lp721
VES: When we think about
p722
aVin terms of how far we can go,
p723
aVI think that's a question that's really only limited
p724
aVby what we're willing to put into it.
p725
aVI think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past
p726
aVhas been exactly what we as not just a nation
p727
aVbut as a people around the world need,
p728
aVand by cooperating, by engaging not just
p729
aVthe technical parts of society,
p730
aVbut as you said, the users,
p731
aVthe people around the world who contribute
p732
aVthrough the Internet, through social media,
p733
aVwho just check the weather,
p734
aVwho rely on it every day as a part of their life,
p735
aVto champion that.
p736
aVWe'll get not just the Internet we've had,
p737
aVbut a better Internet, a better now,
p738
aVsomething that we can use to build a future
p739
aVthat'll be better not just than what we hoped for
p740
aVbut anything that we could have imagined.
p741
aa(lp742
VCA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984.
p743
aVA lot of the conversation since then has been
p744
aValong the lines that
p745
aVactually George Orwell got it wrong.
p746
aVIt's not Big Brother watching us.
p747
aVWe, through the power of the web,
p748
aVand transparency, are now watching Big Brother.
p749
aVYour revelations kind of drove a stake
p750
aVthrough the heart of that rather optimistic view,
p751
aVbut you still believe there's a way of doing something
p752
aVabout that.
p753
aVAnd you do too.
p754
aa(lp755
VES: Right, so there is an argument to be made
p756
aVthat the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously.
p757
aVThere was a recent legal article at Yale
p758
aVthat established something called the Bankston-Soltani Principle,
p759
aVwhich is that our expectation of privacy is violated
p760
aVwhen the capabilities of government surveillance
p761
aVhave become cheaper by an order of magnitude,
p762
aVand each time that occurs, we need to revisit
p763
aVand rebalance our privacy rights.
p764
aVNow, that hasn't happened since
p765
aVthe government's surveillance powers
p766
aVhave increased by several orders of magnitude,
p767
aVand that's why we're in the problem that we're in today,
p768
aVbut there is still hope,
p769
aVbecause the power of individuals
p770
aVhave also been increased by technology.
p771
aVI am living proof
p772
aVthat an individual can go head to head
p773
aVagainst the most powerful adversaries
p774
aVand the most powerful intelligence agencies
p775
aVaround the world and win,
p776
aVand I think that's something
p777
aVthat we need to take hope from,
p778
aVand we need to build on
p779
aVto make it accessible not just to technical experts
p780
aVbut to ordinary citizens around the world.
p781
aVJournalism is not a crime,
p782
aVcommunication is not a crime,
p783
aVand we should not be monitored in our everyday activities.
p784
aa(lp785
VCA: I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot,
p786
aVbut I imagine it's, this is the hand right here. TBL: That'll come very soon.
p787
aVES: Nice to meet you,
p788
aVand I hope my beam looks as nice
p789
aVas my view of you guys does.
p790
aa(lp791
VCA: Thank you, Tim.
p792
aa(lp793
V(Applause)
p794
aa(lp795
VI mean, The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you.
p796
aVWould you welcome the chance to come back to America?
p797
aa(lp798
VES: Absolutely. There's really no question,
p799
aVthe principles that have been the foundation
p800
aVof this project
p801
aVhave been the public interest
p802
aVand the principles that underly
p803
aVthe journalistic establishment in the United States
p804
aVand around the world,
p805
aVand I think if the press is now saying,
p806
aVwe support this,
p807
aVthis is something that needed to happen,
p808
aVthat's a powerful argument, but it's not the final argument,
p809
aVand I think that's something that public should decide.
p810
aVBut at the same time,
p811
aVthe government has hinted that they want
p812
aVsome kind of deal,
p813
aVthat they want me to compromise
p814
aVthe journalists with which I've been working,
p815
aVto come back,
p816
aVand I want to make it very clear
p817
aVthat I did not do this to be safe.
p818
aVI did this to do what was right,
p819
aVand I'm not going to stop my work
p820
aVin the public interest
p821
aVjust to benefit myself.
p822
aV(Applause)
p823
aa(lp824
VCA: In the meantime,
p825
aVcourtesy of the Internet and this technology,
p826
aVyou're here, back in North America,
p827
aVnot quite the U.S., Canada, in this form.
p828
aVI'm curious, how does that feel?
p829
aa(lp830
VES: Canada is different than what I expected.
p831
aVIt's a lot warmer.
p832
aV(Laughter)
p833
aa(lp834
VCA: At TED, the mission is "ideas worth spreading."
p835
aVIf you could encapsulate it in a single idea,
p836
aVwhat is your idea worth spreading
p837
aVright now at this moment?
p838
aVES: I would say the last year has been a reminder
p839
aVthat democracy may die behind closed doors,
p840
aVbut we as individuals are born
p841
aVbehind those same closed doors,
p842
aVand we don't have to give up
p843
aVour privacy to have good government.
p844
aVWe don't have to give up our liberty
p845
aVto have security.
p846
aVAnd I think by working together
p847
aVwe can have both open government
p848
aVand private lives,
p849
aVand I look forward to working with everyone
p850
aVaround the world to see that happen.
p851
aa(lp852
VThank you very much.
p853
aa(lp854
VCA: Ed, thank you.

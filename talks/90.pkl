VThis meeting has really been about a digital revolution,
p5
aVbut I'd like to argue that it's done; we won.
p6
aVWe've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it.
p7
aVAnd I'd like to look after that,
p8
aVto look what comes after the digital revolution.
p9
aVSo, let me start projecting forward.
p10
aVThese are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT,
p11
aVlooking what comes after computers.
p12
aa(lp13
VThis first one, Internet Zero, up here \u2014 this is a web server
p14
aVthat has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag \u2014
p15
aVabout a dollar \u2014 that can go in every light bulb and doorknob,
p16
aVand this is getting commercialized very quickly.
p17
aVAnd what's interesting about it isn't the cost;
p18
aVit's the way it encodes the Internet.
p19
aVIt uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet
p20
aVso you could send it optically; you can communicate acoustically
p21
aVthrough a power line, through RF.
p22
aVIt takes the original principle of the Internet,
p23
aVwhich is inter-networking computers,
p24
aVand now lets devices inter-network.
p25
aVThat we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet
p26
aVand bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero,
p27
aVthis internet of devices.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo this is the next step from there to here,
p30
aVand this is getting commercialized today.
p31
aVA step after that is a project on fungible computers.
p32
aVFungible goods in economics can be extended and traded.
p33
aVSo, half as much grain is half as much useful,
p34
aVbut half a baby or half a computer is less useful than
p35
aVa whole baby or a whole computer,
p36
aVand we've been trying to make computers that work that way.
p37
aVSo, what you see in the background is a prototype.
p38
aVThis was from a thesis of a student, Bill Butow, now at Intel,
p39
aVwho wondered why, instead of making bigger and bigger chips,
p40
aVyou don't make small chips, put them in a viscous medium,
p41
aVand pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch.
p42
aVAnd that's what you see here.
p43
aVOn the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer;
p44
aVon the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype
p45
aVwe made, but there's no frame buffer, IO processor,
p46
aVany of that stuff \u2014 it's just this material.
p47
aVUnlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully,
p48
aVthis is a raw material.
p49
aVIf you add twice as much of it, you have twice as much display.
p50
aVIf you shoot a gun through the middle, nothing happens.
p51
aVIf you need more resource, you just apply more computer.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, that's the step after this \u2014 of computing as a raw material.
p54
aVThat's still conventional bits, the step after that is \u2014
p55
aVthis is an earlier prototype in the lab;
p56
aVthis is high-speed video slowed down.
p57
aVNow, integrating chemistry in computation, where the bits are bubbles.
p58
aVThis is showing making bits, this is showing \u2014
p59
aVonce again, slowed down so you can see it,
p60
aVbits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing.
p61
aVSo, now we can compute that the output arranges material
p62
aVas well as information. And, ultimately, these are some slides
p63
aVfrom an early project I did, computing where the bits are stored
p64
aVquantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms, so
p65
aVprograms rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules.
p66
aVAll of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further,
p67
aVnot as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms,
p68
aVand they lead to the following recognition.
p69
aa(lp70
VWe all know we've had a digital revolution, but what is that?
p71
aVWell, Shannon took us, in the '40s, from here to here:
p72
aVfrom a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance
p73
aVto the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem, that shows
p74
aVif you add information and remove it to a signal,
p75
aVyou can compute perfectly with an imperfect device.
p76
aVAnd that's when we got the Internet.
p77
aVVon Neumann, in the '50s, did the same thing for computing;
p78
aVhe showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state
p79
aVto make it perfect. This was the last great analog computer at MIT:
p80
aVa differential analyzer, and the more you ran it,
p81
aVthe worse the answer got.
p82
aa(lp83
VAfter Von Neumann, we have the Pentium, where the billionth transistor
p84
aVis as reliable as the first one.
p85
aVBut all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner.
p86
aVA state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal,
p87
aVor you maybe melt some plastic. A 10-billion-dollar chip fab
p88
aVuses a process a village artisan would recognize \u2014
p89
aVyou spread stuff around and bake it.
p90
aVAll the intelligence is external to the system;
p91
aVthe materials don't have information.
p92
aVYesterday you heard about molecular biology,
p93
aVwhich fundamentally computes to build.
p94
aVIt's an information processing system.
p95
aVWe've had digital revolutions in communication and computation,
p96
aVbut precisely the same idea, precisely the same math
p97
aVShannon and Von Neuman did, hasn't yet come out
p98
aVto the physical world. So, inspired by that,
p99
aVcolleagues in this program \u2014 the Center for Bits and Atoms
p100
aVat MIT \u2014 which is a group of people, like me,
p101
aVwho never understood the boundary between physical science
p102
aVand computer science. I would even go further and say
p103
aVcomputer science is one of the worst things that ever happened
p104
aVto either computers or to science \u2014
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aV\u2014 because the canon \u2014 computer science \u2014
p107
aVmany of them are great but the canon of computer science
p108
aVprematurely froze a model of computation
p109
aVbased on technology that was available in 1950,
p110
aVand nature's a much more powerful computer than that.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo, you'll hear, tomorrow, from Saul Griffith. He was one of the
p113
aVfirst students to emerge from this program.
p114
aVWe started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate.
p115
aVThis was just a proof of principle he did of tiles
p116
aVthat interact magnetically, where you write a code,
p117
aVmuch like protein folding, that specifies their structure.
p118
aVSo, there's no feedback to a tool metrology;
p119
aVthe material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways
p120
aVthat protein are fabricated. So, you can, for example, do that.
p121
aVYou can do other things. That's in 2D. It works in 3D.
p122
aVThe video on the upper right \u2014 I won't show for time \u2014
p123
aVshows self-replication, templating so something can make something
p124
aVthat can make something, and we're doing that now over, maybe,
p125
aVnine orders of magnitude. Those ideas have been used to show
p126
aVthe best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism,
p127
aVin functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails
p128
aVthat code for their assembly \u2014 so, much like the magnets,
p129
aVbut now on nanometer scales.
p130
aVLaser micro-machining: essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate
p131
aVfunctional systems, all the way up to building buildings,
p132
aVnot by having blueprints,
p133
aVbut having the parts code for the structure of the building.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo, these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies
p136
aVto digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools
p137
aVbut computers that are tools, where the output of a program
p138
aVrearranges atoms as well as bits.
p139
aVNow, to do that \u2014 with your tax dollars, thank you \u2014
p140
aVI bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal
p141
aVto the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale,
p142
aVall in one place, because you can't segregate digital fabrication
p143
aVby a discipline or a length scale.
p144
aVSo we put together focused nano beam writers
p145
aVand supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems.
p146
aa(lp147
VBut I had a problem. Once I had all these machines,
p148
aVI was spending too much time teaching students to use them.
p149
aVSo I started teaching a class, modestly called,
p150
aV"How To Make Almost Anything." And that wasn't meant to be provocative;
p151
aVit was just for a few research students.
p152
aVBut the first day of class looked like this.
p153
aVYou know, hundreds of people came in begging,
p154
aVall my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it.
p155
aVThen they'd ask, can you teach it at MIT? It seems too useful?
p156
aVAnd then the next \u2014
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aV\u2014 surprising thing was they weren't there to do research.
p159
aVThey were there because they wanted to make stuff.
p160
aVThey had no conventional technical background.
p161
aVAt the end of a semester they integrated their skills.
p162
aa(lp163
VI'll show an old video. Kelly was a sculptor, and this is what she did
p164
aVwith her semester project.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Video): Kelly: Hi, I'm Kelly and this is my scream buddy.
p167
aVDo you ever find yourself in a situation
p168
aVwhere you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work,
p169
aVor you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children,
p170
aVor you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted?
p171
aVWell, scream buddy is a portable space for screaming.
p172
aVWhen a user screams into scream buddy, their scream is silenced.
p173
aVIt is also recorded for later release where, when and how
p174
aVthe user chooses.
p175
aV(Scream)
p176
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VSo, Einstein would like this.
p179
aVThis student made a web browser for parrots \u2014
p180
aVlets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots.
p181
aVThis student's made an alarm clock you wrestle
p182
aVto prove you're awake; this is one that defends \u2014
p183
aVa dress that defends your personal space.
p184
aVThis isn't technology for communication;
p185
aVit's technology to prevent it.
p186
aVThis is a device that lets you see your music.
p187
aVThis is a student who made a machine that makes machines,
p188
aVand he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing.
p189
aVJust year after year \u2014 and I finally realized
p190
aVthe students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication
p191
aVis products for a market of one person.
p192
aVYou don't need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart;
p193
aVyou need this for what makes you unique.
p194
aVKen Olsen famously said, nobody needs a computer in the home.
p195
aVBut you don't use it for inventory and payroll;
p196
aVDEC is now twice bankrupt. You don't need personal fabrication
p197
aVin the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.
p198
aVYou need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization.
p199
aVSo, with that, in turn, 20 million dollars today does this;
p200
aV20 years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything.
p201
aVThe students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication.
p202
aa(lp203
VToday, when you spend that much of your money,
p204
aVthere's a government requirement to do outreach, which often means
p205
aVclasses at a local school, a website \u2014 stuff that's just not that exciting.
p206
aVSo, I made a deal with my NSF program managers that
p207
aVinstead of talking about it, I'd give people the tools.
p208
aVThis wasn't meant to be provocative or important,
p209
aVbut we put together these Fab Labs. It's about 20,000 dollars in equipment
p210
aVthat approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it's going.
p211
aVA laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3D from 2D,
p212
aVa sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics,
p213
aVa micron scale,
p214
aVnumerically-controlled milling machine for precise structures,
p215
aVprogramming tools for less than a dollar,
p216
aV100-nanosecond microcontrollers. It lets you work from microns
p217
aVand microseconds on up, and they exploded around the world.
p218
aVThis wasn't scheduled, but they went from inner-city Boston
p219
aVto Pobal in India, to Secondi-Takoradi on Ghana's coast
p220
aVto Soshanguve in a township in South Africa,
p221
aVto the far north of Norway, uncovering, or helping uncover,
p222
aVfor all the attention to the digital divide,
p223
aVwe would find unused computers in all these places.
p224
aVA farmer in a rural village \u2014 a kid needs to measure and modify
p225
aVthe world, not just get information about it on a screen.
p226
aVThat there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide
p227
aVbigger than the digital divide.
p228
aVAnd the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo, in place after place
p231
aVwe saw this same progression: that we'd open one of these Fab Labs,
p232
aVwhere we didn't \u2014 this is too crazy to think of.
p233
aVWe didn't think this up, that we would get pulled to these places;
p234
aVwe'd open it. The first step was just empowerment.
p235
aVYou can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it.
p236
aVThis is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech
p237
aVon-demand craft sale in the inner city community center.
p238
aVIt goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education
p239
aVinformally, out of schools. In Ghana we had set up one of these labs.
p240
aVWe designed a network sensor, and kids would show up
p241
aVand refuse to leave the lab.
p242
aVThere was a girl who insisted we stay late at night \u2014
p243
aV(Video): Kids: I love the Fab Lab.
p244
aV\u2014 her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor.
p245
aVSo she insisted on fabbing the board, learning how to stuff it,
p246
aVlearning how to program it. She didn't really know
p247
aVwhat she was doing or why she was doing it, but she knew
p248
aVshe just had to do it. There was something electric about it.
p249
aVThis is late at, you know, 11 o'clock at night
p250
aVand I think I was the only person surprised when what she built
p251
aVworked the first time.
p252
aVAnd I've shown this to engineers at big companies, and they say
p253
aVthey can't do this. Any one thing she's doing, they can do better,
p254
aVbut it's distributed over many people and many sites
p255
aVand they can't do in an afternoon
p256
aVwhat this little girl in rural Ghana is doing.
p257
aV(Video): Girl: My name is Valentina Kofi; I am eight years old.
p258
aVI made a stacking board.
p259
aVAnd, again, that was just for the joy of it.
p260
aa(lp261
VThen these labs started doing serious problem solving \u2014
p262
aVinstrumentation for agriculture in India,
p263
aVsteam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana,
p264
aVhigh-gain antennas in thin client computers.
p265
aVAnd then, in turn, businesses started to grow,
p266
aVlike making these antennas.
p267
aVAnd finally, the lab started doing invention.
p268
aVWe're learning more from them than we're giving them.
p269
aVI was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it.
p270
aVThey invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box \u2014
p271
aVwhich, as you see up there, that's becoming a business \u2014
p272
aVbut their design was better than Saul's design at MIT,
p273
aVso there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on
p274
aVscaling the work of eight-year-old children
p275
aVbecause they had better designs.
p276
aVReal invention is happening in these labs.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd I still kept \u2014 so, in the last year I've been spending time with
p279
aVheads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this,
p280
aVand I keep saying, but this isn't the real thing.
p281
aVWait, like, 20 years and then we'll be done.
p282
aVAnd I finally got what's been going on. This is Kernigan and Ritchie
p283
aVinventing UNIX on a PDP.
p284
aVPDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers.
p285
aVThey were tens of thousands of dollars, hard to use,
p286
aVbut they brought computing down to work groups,
p287
aVand everything we do today happened there.
p288
aVThese Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP.
p289
aVThe projection of digital fabrication
p290
aVisn't a projection for the future; we are now in the PDP era.
p291
aVWe talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then.
p292
aVIt was very chaotic, it wasn't, sort of, clear what was going on.
p293
aVIn the same sense we are now, today, in the minicomputer era
p294
aVof digital fabrication.
p295
aVThe only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries.
p296
aa(lp297
VIn DC, I go to every agency that wants to talk, you know;
p298
aVin the Bay Area, I go to every organization you can think of \u2014
p299
aVthey all want to talk about it, but it breaks
p300
aVtheir organizational boundaries. In fact, it's illegal for them,
p301
aVin many cases, to equip ordinary people to create
p302
aVrather than consume technology.
p303
aVAnd that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention
p304
aVcoming from this community surprised me:
p305
aVit's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway \u2014
p306
aVthis is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground
p307
aVrather than the sky because that's where the satellites are \u2014
p308
aVthe lab outgrew the little barn that it was in.
p309
aVIt was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains
p310
aVbut it outgrew it, so they built this extraordinary village for the lab.
p311
aVThis isn't a university; it's not a company. It's essentially
p312
aVa village for invention; it's a village for the outliers in society,
p313
aVand those have been growing up around these Fab Labs
p314
aVall around the world.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo this program has split into an NGO foundation,
p317
aVa Fab Foundation to support the scaling, a micro VC fund.
p318
aVThe person who runs it nicely describes it as
p319
aV"machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses:"
p320
aVit's a cross between micro-finance and VC to do fan-out,
p321
aVand then the research partnerships back at MIT for what's
p322
aVmaking it possible.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo I'd like to leave you with two thoughts.
p325
aVThere's been a sea change in aid, from top-down mega-projects
p326
aVto bottom-up, grassroots, micro-finance investing in the roots,
p327
aVso that everybody's got that that's what works.
p328
aVBut we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects.
p329
aVComputing, communication, energy for the rest of the planet
p330
aVare these top-down mega-projects.
p331
aVIf this room full of heroes is just clever enough,
p332
aVyou can solve the problems.
p333
aVThe message coming from the Fab Labs is that
p334
aVthe other five billion people on the planet
p335
aVaren't just technical sinks; they're sources.
p336
aVThe real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world
p337
aVto locally design and produce solutions to local problems.
p338
aVI thought that's the projection 20 years hence into the future,
p339
aVbut it's where we are today.
p340
aVIt breaks every organizational boundary we can think of.
p341
aVThe hardest thing at this point is the social engineering
p342
aVand the organizational engineering, but it's here today.
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd, finally, any talk like this on the future of computing
p345
aVis required to show Moore's law, but my favorite version \u2014
p346
aVthis is Gordon Moore's original one from his original paper \u2014
p347
aVand what's happened is, year after year after year,
p348
aVwe've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled
p349
aVand we've scaled, and we've scaled and we've scaled,
p350
aVand we've scaled and we've scaled,
p351
aVand there's this looming bug of what's going to happen
p352
aVat the end of Moore's law; this ultimate bug is coming.
p353
aVBut we're coming to appreciate, is the transition from 2D to 3D,
p354
aVfrom programming bits to programming atoms,
p355
aVturns the ends of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug
p356
aVto the ultimate feature.
p357
aVSo, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication,
p358
aVwhere the output of computation programs the physical world.
p359
aVSo, together, these two projects answer questions
p360
aVI hadn't asked carefully. The class at MIT shows the killer app
p361
aVfor personal fabrication in the developed world
p362
aVis technology for a market of one: personal expression in technology
p363
aVthat touches a passion unlike anything I've seen in technology
p364
aVfor a very long time.
p365
aVAnd the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation
p366
aVand the fabrication divide: people locally developing solutions
p367
aVto local problems. Thank you.

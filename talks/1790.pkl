VIt is said that the grass is always greener
p5
aVon the other side of the fence,
p6
aVand I believe this is true,
p7
aVespecially when I hear President Obama
p8
aVoften talk about the Korean education system
p9
aVas a benchmark of success.
p10
aVWell, I can tell you that,
p11
aVin the rigid structure and highly competitive nature
p12
aVof the Korean school system,
p13
aValso known as pressure cooker,
p14
aVnot everyone can do well in that environment.
p15
aVWhile many people responded in different ways
p16
aVabout our education system,
p17
aVmy response to the high-pressure environment
p18
aVwas making bows with pieces of wood
p19
aVfound near my apartment building.
p20
aa(lp21
VWhy bows?
p22
aVI'm not quite sure.
p23
aVPerhaps, in the face of constant pressure,
p24
aVmy caveman instinct of survival
p25
aVhas connected with the bows.
p26
aVIf you think about it,
p27
aVthe bow has really helped drive human survival
p28
aVsince prehistoric times.
p29
aVThe area within three kilometers of my home
p30
aVused to be a mulberry forest
p31
aVduring the Joseon dynasty,
p32
aVwhere silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves.
p33
aVIn order to raise the historical awareness of this fact,
p34
aVthe government has planted mulberry trees.
p35
aVThe seeds from these trees
p36
aValso have spread by birds here and there
p37
aVnearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway
p38
aVthat has been built around the 1988 Olympics.
p39
aVThe area near these walls,
p40
aVwhich nobody bothers to pay attention to,
p41
aVhad been left free from major intervention,
p42
aVand this is where I first found my treasures.
p43
aa(lp44
VAs I fell deeper into bow making,
p45
aVI began to search far and beyond my neighborhood.
p46
aVWhen I went on school field trips,
p47
aVfamily vacations, or simply on my way home
p48
aVfrom extracurricular classes,
p49
aVI wandered around wooded areas
p50
aVand gathered tree branches
p51
aVwith the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag.
p52
aVAnd they would be somethings like saws, knives,
p53
aVsickles and axes
p54
aVthat I covered up with a piece of towel.
p55
aVI would bring the branches home,
p56
aVriding buses and subways,
p57
aVbarely holding them in my hands.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.
p60
aVAirport security.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aVIn the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust,
p64
aVI would saw, trim and polish wood all night long
p65
aVuntil a bow took shape.
p66
aa(lp67
VOne day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece
p68
aVand ended up setting the place on fire.
p69
aVWhere? The rooftop of my apartment building,
p70
aVa place where 96 families call home.
p71
aVA customer from a department store across from my building
p72
aVcalled 911,
p73
aVand I ran downstairs to tell my mom
p74
aVwith half of my hair burned.
p75
aVI want to take this opportunity
p76
aVto tell my mom, in the audience today:
p77
aVMom, I was really sorry,
p78
aVand I will be more careful with open fire from now on.
p79
aa(lp80
VMy mother had to do a lot of explaining,
p81
aVtelling people that her son did not commit
p82
aVa premeditated arson.
p83
aa(lp84
VI also researched extensively on bows around the world.
p85
aVIn that process, I tried to combine
p86
aVthe different bows from across time and places
p87
aVto create the most effective bow.
p88
aVI also worked with many different types of wood,
p89
aVsuch as maple, yew and mulberry,
p90
aVand did many shooting experiments
p91
aVin the wooded area near the urban expressway
p92
aVthat I mentioned before.
p93
aa(lp94
VThe most effective bow for me
p95
aVwould be like this.
p96
aa(lp97
VOne: Curved tips can maximize the springiness
p98
aVwhen you draw and shoot the arrow.
p99
aa(lp100
VTwo: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight,
p101
aVwhich means more power.
p102
aa(lp103
VThree: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb
p104
aVfor maximum tension storage.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd four: Horn used to store energy in compression.
p107
aa(lp108
VAfter fixing, breaking, redesigning,
p109
aVmending, bending and amending,
p110
aVmy ideal bow began to take shape,
p111
aVand when it was finally done,
p112
aVit looked like this.
p113
aVI was so proud of myself
p114
aVfor inventing a perfect bow on my own.
p115
aVThis is a picture of Korean traditional bows
p116
aVtaken from a museum,
p117
aVand see how my bow resembles them.
p118
aVThanks to my ancestors
p119
aVfor robbing me of my invention. (Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VThrough bowmaking,
p122
aVI came in contact with part of my heritage.
p123
aVLearning the information that has accumulated over time
p124
aVand reading the message left by my ancestors
p125
aVwere better than any consolation therapy
p126
aVor piece of advice any living adults could give me.
p127
aVYou see, I searched far and wide,
p128
aVbut never bothered to look close and near.
p129
aVFrom this realization,
p130
aVI began to take interest in Korean history,
p131
aVwhich had never inspired me before.
p132
aVIn the end, the grass is often greener
p133
aVon my side of the fence,
p134
aValthough we don't realize it.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, I am going to show you how my bow works.
p137
aVAnd let's see how this one works.
p138
aVThis is a bamboo bow,
p139
aVwith 45-pound draw weights.
p140
aV(Noise of shooting arrow)
p141
aV(Applause)
p142
aa(lp143
VA bow may function in a simple mechanism,
p144
aVbut in order to make a good bow,
p145
aVa great amount of sensitivity is required.
p146
aVYou need to console and communicate
p147
aVwith the wood material.
p148
aVEach fiber in the wood
p149
aVhas its own reason and function for being,
p150
aVand only through cooperation and harmony among them
p151
aVcomes a great bow.
p152
aVI may be an [odd] student
p153
aVwith unconventional interests,
p154
aVbut I hope I am making a contribution
p155
aVby sharing my story with all of you.
p156
aa(lp157
VMy ideal world is a place
p158
aVwhere no one is left behind,
p159
aVwhere everyone is needed exactly where they are,
p160
aVlike the fibers and the tendons in a bow,
p161
aVa place where the strong is flexible
p162
aVand the vulnerable is resilient.
p163
aVThe bow resembles me,
p164
aVand I resemble the bow.
p165
aVNow, I am shooting a part of myself to you.
p166
aVNo, better yet, a part of my mind
p167
aVhas just been shot over to your mind.
p168
aVDid it strike you?
p169
aa(lp170
VThank you.

VHi. This is my mobile phone.
p5
aVA mobile phone can change your life,
p6
aVand a mobile phone gives you individual freedom.
p7
aVWith a mobile phone,
p8
aVyou can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria.
p9
aVWith a mobile phone,
p10
aVyou can tweet a message
p11
aVand start a protest in Egypt.
p12
aVAnd with a mobile phone,
p13
aVyou can record a song, load it up to
p14
aVSoundCloud and become famous.
p15
aVAll this is possible with your mobile phone.
p16
aa(lp17
VI'm a child of 1984,
p18
aVand I live in the city of Berlin.
p19
aVLet's go back to that time, to this city.
p20
aVHere you can see
p21
aVhow hundreds of thousands of people
p22
aVstood up and protested for change.
p23
aVThis is autumn 1989,
p24
aVand imagine that all those people standing up
p25
aVand protesting for change had a
p26
aVmobile phone in their pocket.
p27
aa(lp28
VWho in the room has a mobile phone with you?
p29
aVHold it up.
p30
aVHold your phones up, hold your phones up!
p31
aVHold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
p32
aVThat's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut today I will talk about me and my mobile phone,
p35
aVand how it changed my life.
p36
aVAnd I will talk about this.
p37
aVThese are 35,830 lines of information.
p38
aVRaw data.
p39
aVAnd why are these informations there?
p40
aVBecause in the summer of 2006,
p41
aVthe E.U. Commission tabled a directive.
p42
aa(lp43
VThis directive [is] called Data Retention Directive.
p44
aVThis directive says that each phone company in Europe,
p45
aVeach Internet service company all over Europe,
p46
aVhas to store a wide range of information about the users.
p47
aVWho calls whom? Who sends whom an email?
p48
aVWho sends whom a text message?
p49
aVAnd if you use your mobile phone, where you are.
p50
aVAll this information is stored for at least six months,
p51
aVup to two years by your phone company
p52
aVor your Internet service provider.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd all over Europe, people stood up and said,
p55
aV"We don't want this."
p56
aVThey said, we don't want this data retention.
p57
aVWe want self-determination in the digital age,
p58
aVand we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies
p59
aVhave to store all this information about us.
p60
aVThey were lawyers, journalists, priests,
p61
aVthey all said: "We don't want this."
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd here you can see, like 10 thousands of people
p64
aVwent out on the streets of Berlin and said,
p65
aV"Freedom, not fear."
p66
aVAnd some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0.
p67
aVStasi was the secret police in East Germany.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd I also ask myself, does it really work?
p70
aVCan they really store all this information about us?
p71
aVEvery time I use my mobile phone?
p72
aVSo I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom,
p73
aVwhich was at that time the largest phone company in Germany,
p74
aVand I asked them, please,
p75
aVsend me all the information you have stored about me.
p76
aVAnd I asked them once, and I asked them again,
p77
aVand I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut then I said, I want to have this information,
p80
aVbecause this is my life you are protocoling.
p81
aVSo I decided to start a lawsuit against them,
p82
aVbecause I wanted to have this information.
p83
aVBut Deutsche Telekom said, no,
p84
aVwe will not give you this information.
p85
aVSo at the end, I had a settlement with them.
p86
aVI'll put down the lawsuit
p87
aVand they will send me all the information I ask for.
p88
aVBecause in the mean time,
p89
aVthe German Constitutional Court ruled
p90
aVthat the implementation of this E.U. directive
p91
aVinto German law was unconstitutional.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo I got this ugly brown envelope
p94
aVwith a C.D. inside.
p95
aVAnd on the C.D., this was on.
p96
aVThirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information.
p97
aVAt first I saw it, and I said, okay,
p98
aVit's a huge file. Okay.
p99
aVBut then after a while I realized,
p100
aVthis is my life.
p101
aVThis is six months of my life,
p102
aVinto this file.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it?
p105
aVBecause you can see where I am,
p106
aVwhere I sleep at night,
p107
aVwhat I am doing.
p108
aVBut then I said, I want to go out with this information.
p109
aVI want to make them public.
p110
aVBecause I want to show the people what does data retention mean.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo together with Zeit Online and Open Data City, I did this.
p113
aVThis is a visualization of six months of my life.
p114
aVYou can zoom in and zoom out,
p115
aVyou can wind back and fast forward.
p116
aVYou can see every step I take.
p117
aVAnd you can even see
p118
aVhow I go from Frankfurt by train
p119
aVto Cologne, and how often I call in between.
p120
aa(lp121
VAll this is possible with this information.
p122
aVThat's a little bit scary.
p123
aVBut it is not only about me.
p124
aVIt's about all of us.
p125
aVFirst, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me,
p126
aVand we talk to each other a couple of times.
p127
aVAnd then there are some friends calling me,
p128
aVand they call each other.
p129
aVAnd after a while you are calling you,
p130
aVand you are calling you, and you have this great
p131
aVcommunication network.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut you can see how your people are communicating with each other,
p134
aVwhat times they call each other, when they go to bed.
p135
aVYou can see all of this.
p136
aVYou can see the hubs, like who are the leaders in the group.
p137
aVIf you have access to this information,
p138
aVyou can see what your society is doing.
p139
aVIf you have access to this information,
p140
aVyou can control your society.
p141
aa(lp142
VThis is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
p143
aVThis is a blueprint how to survey your society,
p144
aVbecause you know who talks to whom,
p145
aVwho sends whom an email, all this is possible
p146
aVif you have access to this information.
p147
aVAnd this information is stored for at least six months
p148
aVin Europe, up to two years.
p149
aa(lp150
VLike I said at the beginning,
p151
aVimagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin
p152
aVin autumn of 1989
p153
aVhad a mobile phone in their pocket.
p154
aVAnd the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest,
p155
aVand if the Stasi would have known
p156
aVwho are the leaders behind it,
p157
aVthis may never have happened.
p158
aVThe fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [have been] there.
p159
aVAnd in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain.
p160
aVBecause today, state agencies and companies
p161
aVwant to store as much information as they can get about us,
p162
aVonline and offline.
p163
aVThey want to have the possibility to track our lives,
p164
aVand they want to store them for all time.
p165
aa(lp166
VBut self-determination and living in the digital age
p167
aVis no contradiction.
p168
aVBut you have to fight for your self-determination today.
p169
aVYou have to fight for it every day.
p170
aVSo, when you go home,
p171
aVtell your friends
p172
aVthat privacy is a value of the 21st century,
p173
aVand it's not outdated.
p174
aVWhen you go home, tell your representative
p175
aVonly because companies and state agencies have the possibility
p176
aVto store certain information, they don't have to do it.
p177
aVAnd if you don't believe me,
p178
aVask your phone company what information they store about you.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone,
p181
aVlet it be a reminder to you
p182
aVthat you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.
p183
aVThank you.

VThe theme of my talk today is,
p5
aV"Be an artist, right now."
p6
aVMost people, when this subject is brought up,
p7
aVget tense and resist it:
p8
aV"Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy.
p9
aVI have to go to school, get a job,
p10
aVsend my kids to lessons ... "
p11
aVYou think, "I'm too busy. I don't have time for art."
p12
aVThere are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.
p13
aVDon't they just pop into your head?
p14
aa(lp15
VThere are so many reasons why we can't be,
p16
aVindeed, we're not sure why we should be.
p17
aVWe don't know why we should be artists,
p18
aVbut we have many reasons why we can't be.
p19
aVWhy do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?
p20
aVPerhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted
p21
aVor for the thoroughly and professionally trained.
p22
aVAnd some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.
p23
aVWell you might have, but I don't think so.
p24
aVThis is the theme of my talk today.
p25
aVWe are all born artists.
p26
aa(lp27
VIf you have kids, you know what I mean.
p28
aVAlmost everything kids do is art.
p29
aVThey draw with crayons on the wall.
p30
aVThey dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV,
p31
aVbut you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance \u2014 it becomes the kids' own dance.
p32
aVSo they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.
p33
aVPerhaps their art is something only their parents can bear,
p34
aVand because they practice such art all day long,
p35
aVpeople honestly get a little tired around kids.
p36
aa(lp37
VKids will sometimes perform monodramas \u2014
p38
aVplaying house is indeed a monodrama or a play.
p39
aVAnd some kids, when they get a bit older,
p40
aVstart to lie.
p41
aVUsually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.
p42
aVThey're shocked.
p43
aV"Now you're showing your true colors," Mom says. She thinks, "Why does he take after his dad?"
p44
aVShe questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?"
p45
aa(lp46
VBut you shouldn't worry.
p47
aVThe moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.
p48
aVThey are talking about things they didn't see.
p49
aVIt's amazing. It's a wonderful moment.
p50
aVParents should celebrate.
p51
aV"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!"
p52
aVAll right! It calls for celebration.
p53
aVFor example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home."
p54
aVThen a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."
p55
aVNow, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this:
p56
aV"Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?
p57
aVWhere did you meet it?" "Um, in front of the supermarket."
p58
aa(lp59
VWhen you have a conversation like this,
p60
aVthe kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.
p61
aVSoon, a story develops.
p62
aVOf course this is an infantile story,
p63
aVbut thinking up one sentence after the next
p64
aVis the same thing a professional writer like me does.
p65
aVIn essence, they are not different.
p66
aVRoland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels,
p67
aV"Flaubert did not write a novel.
p68
aVHe merely connected one sentence after another.
p69
aVThe eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel."
p70
aVThat's right \u2014 a novel, basically, is writing one sentence,
p71
aVthen, without violating the scope of the first one,
p72
aVwriting the next sentence.
p73
aVAnd you continue to make connections.
p74
aa(lp75
VTake a look at this sentence:
p76
aV"One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug."
p77
aVYes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."
p78
aVWriting such an unjustifiable sentence
p79
aVand continuing in order to justify it,
p80
aVKafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.
p81
aVKafka did not show his work to his father.
p82
aVHe was not on good terms with his father.
p83
aVOn his own, he wrote these sentences.
p84
aVHad he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd that's right. Art is about going a little nuts
p87
aVand justifying the next sentence,
p88
aVwhich is not much different from what a kid does.
p89
aVA kid who has just started to lie
p90
aVis taking the first step as a storyteller.
p91
aVKids do art.
p92
aVThey don't get tired and they have fun doing it.
p93
aVI was in Jeju Island a few days ago.
p94
aVWhen kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.
p95
aVBut some of them spend a lot of time in the sand,
p96
aVmaking mountains and seas \u2014 well, not seas,
p97
aVbut different things \u2014 people and dogs, etc.
p98
aVBut parents tell them,
p99
aV"It will all be washed away by the waves."
p100
aVIn other words, it's useless.
p101
aVThere's no need.
p102
aVBut kids don't mind.
p103
aVThey have fun in the moment
p104
aVand they keep playing in the sand.
p105
aVKids don't do it because someone told them to.
p106
aVThey aren't told by their boss
p107
aVor anyone, they just do it.
p108
aa(lp109
VWhen you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.
p110
aVWhen I ask my students to write about their happiest moment,
p111
aVmany write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.
p112
aVLearning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend,
p113
aVor performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots \u2014 things like that.
p114
aVOr the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.
p115
aVThey talk about these kinds of experiences.
p116
aVYou must have had such a moment.
p117
aVIn that moment, art makes you happy
p118
aVbecause it's not work.
p119
aVWork doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.
p122
aVIt's a bit mischievous, actually.
p123
aV"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."
p124
aVRight? Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?
p125
aVPlaying doesn't tire us.
p126
aVWe can play all night long.
p127
aVIf we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.
p128
aVWhy? Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.
p129
aVBut kids, usually they do art for fun. It's playing.
p130
aVThey don't draw to sell the work to a client
p131
aVor play the piano to earn money for the family.
p132
aVOf course, there were kids who had to.
p133
aVYou know this gentleman, right?
p134
aVHe had to tour around Europe to support his family \u2014
p135
aVWolfgang Amadeus Mozart \u2014
p136
aVbut that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.
p137
aVUnfortunately, at some point our art \u2014 such a joyful pastime \u2014 ends.
p138
aVKids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework
p139
aVand of course they take piano or ballet lessons,
p140
aVbut they aren't fun anymore.
p141
aVYou're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun?
p142
aVIf you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall,
p143
aVyou'll surely get in trouble with your mom.
p144
aVBesides,
p145
aVif you continue to act like an artist as you get older,
p146
aVyou'll increasingly feel pressure \u2014
p147
aVpeople will question your actions and ask you to act properly.
p148
aa(lp149
VHere's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.
p150
aVI was trying my best, and my teacher came around
p151
aVand asked me, "What are you doing?"
p152
aV"I'm drawing diligently," I said.
p153
aV"Why are you using only black?"
p154
aVIndeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.
p155
aVAnd I explained,
p156
aV"It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."
p157
aVThen my teacher said,
p158
aV"Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."
p159
aVOr so I wished.
p160
aV"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response. (Laughter)
p161
aV"You'll get it!" he said.
p162
aVYou were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc.,
p163
aVbut I was coloring everything in black,
p164
aVso he dragged me out of the group.
p165
aVThere were a lot of girls there as well,
p166
aVso I was utterly mortified.
p167
aa(lp168
VNone of my explanations or excuses were heard,
p169
aVand I really got it big time.
p170
aVIf he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before,
p171
aV"Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing,
p172
aVbut he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.
p173
aVBut such a teacher is seldom found.
p174
aVLater, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries \u2014
p175
aVI was a university student \u2014 and I thought this was really unfair.
p176
aVLook what I found. (Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VWorks like this were hung in Basel while I was punished
p179
aVand stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.
p180
aVLook at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper?
p181
aVContemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.
p182
aVNo crows are brought up.
p183
aVMost of the works have no title, Untitled.
p184
aVAnyways, contemporary art in the 20th century
p185
aVis about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation \u2014
p186
aVessentially the same as I did.
p187
aVOf course, my work was very amateur,
p188
aVbut let's turn to more famous examples.
p189
aa(lp190
VThis is Picasso's.
p191
aVHe stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it "Bull's Head." Sounds convincing, right?
p192
aVNext, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".
p193
aVThat was Duchamp.
p194
aVSo filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories \u2014
p195
aVthat's indeed what contemporary art is all about.
p196
aVPicasso even made the statement,
p197
aV"I draw not what I see but what I think."
p198
aVYes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.
p199
aVI wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.
p200
aVUnfortunately, the little artists within us
p201
aVare choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.
p202
aVThey get locked in.
p203
aVThat's our tragedy.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?
p206
aVOur artistic desire doesn't go away.
p207
aVWe want to express, to reveal ourselves,
p208
aVbut with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.
p209
aVIn karaoke bars, there are always people who sing
p210
aV"She's Gone" or "Hotel California,"
p211
aVmiming the guitar riffs.
p212
aVUsually they sound awful. Awful indeed.
p213
aVSome people turn into rockers like this.
p214
aVOr some people dance in clubs.
p215
aVPeople who would have enjoyed telling stories
p216
aVend up trolling on the Internet all night long.
p217
aVThat's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side.
p218
aa(lp219
VSometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids
p220
aVplaying with Legos or putting together plastic robots.
p221
aVThey go, "Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you."
p222
aVThe kid has already lost interest and is doing something else,
p223
aVbut the dad alone builds castles.
p224
aVThis shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.
p225
aVBut they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.
p226
aVYou know the song "I would love to be on TV"? Why would we love it?
p227
aVTV is full of people who do what we wished to do,
p228
aVbut never got to.
p229
aVThey dance, they act \u2014 and the more they do, they are praised.
p230
aVSo we start to envy them.
p231
aVWe become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.
p232
aV"He just can't act." "You call that singing? She can't hit the notes."
p233
aVWe easily say these sorts of things.
p234
aVWe get jealous, not because we're evil,
p235
aVbut because we have little artists pent up inside us.
p236
aVThat's what I think.
p237
aa(lp238
VWhat should we do then?
p239
aVYes, that's right.
p240
aVRight now, we need to start our own art.
p241
aVRight this minute, we can turn off TV,
p242
aVlog off the Internet,
p243
aVget up and start to do something.
p244
aVWhere I teach students in drama school,
p245
aVthere's a course called Dramatics.
p246
aVIn this course, all students must put on a play.
p247
aVHowever, acting majors are not supposed to act.
p248
aVThey can write the play, for example,
p249
aVand the writers may work on stage art.
p250
aVLikewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.
p251
aVStudents at first wonder whether they can actually do it,
p252
aVbut later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.
p253
aVIn school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.
p254
aVI saw this happen in the army \u2014 many people had fun doing plays.
p255
aa(lp256
VI have another experience:
p257
aVIn my writing class, I give students a special assignment.
p258
aVI have students like you in the class \u2014 many who don't major in writing.
p259
aVSome major in art or music and think they can't write.
p260
aVSo I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.
p261
aVIt can be a simple theme:
p262
aVWrite about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.
p263
aVThere's one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy!
p264
aVI walk around and encourage them,
p265
aV"Come on, come on!" They have to write like crazy for an hour or two.
p266
aVThey only get to think for the first five minutes.
p267
aa(lp268
VThe reason I make them write like crazy is because
p269
aVwhen you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind,
p270
aVthe artistic devil creeps in.
p271
aVThis devil will tell you hundreds of reasons
p272
aVwhy you can't write:
p273
aV"People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!
p274
aVWhat kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!"
p275
aVIt will say a lot of things.
p276
aVYou have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.
p277
aVThe really good writing I've seen in my class
p278
aVwas not from the assignments with a long deadline,
p279
aVbut from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did
p280
aVin front of me with a pencil.
p281
aVThe students go into a kind of trance.
p282
aVAfter 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they're writing.
p283
aVAnd in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo I can say this:
p286
aVIt's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist,
p287
aVbut rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.
p288
aVWhy we cannot be something is not important.
p289
aVMost artists became artists because of the one reason.
p290
aVWhen we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art,
p291
aVenemies appear on the outside.
p292
aVMostly, they have the faces of our parents. (Laughter)
p293
aVSometimes they look like our spouses,
p294
aVbut they are not your parents or spouses.
p295
aVThey are devils. Devils.
p296
aVThey came to Earth briefly transformed
p297
aVto stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists.
p298
aVAnd they have a magic question.
p299
aVWhen we say, "I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center," or
p300
aV"I'd like to learn Italian songs," they ask, "Oh, yeah? A play? What for?"
p301
aVThe magic question is, "What for?"
p302
aVBut art is not for anything.
p303
aVArt is the ultimate goal.
p304
aVIt saves our souls and makes us live happily.
p305
aVIt helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.
p306
aVSo in response to such a pragmatic question,
p307
aVwe need to be bold.
p308
aV"Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you,"
p309
aVis what you should say. "I'll just go ahead and do it anyway."
p310
aVThe ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities,
p311
aVat least one of which is an artist.
p312
aa(lp313
VOnce I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat,
p314
aVand in front of me I saw something related to a play.
p315
aVSo I asked the driver, "What is this?"
p316
aVHe said it was his profile. "Then what are you?" I asked. "An actor," he said.
p317
aVHe was a cabby and an actor. I asked, "What roles do you usually play?"
p318
aVHe proudly said he played King Lear.
p319
aVKing Lear.
p320
aV"Who is it that can tell me who I am?" \u2014 a great line from King Lear.
p321
aVThat's the world I dream of.
p322
aVSomeone is a golfer by day and writer by night.
p323
aVOr a cabby and an actor, a banker and a painter,
p324
aVsecretly or publicly performing their own arts.
p325
aa(lp326
VIn 1990, Martha Graham, the legend of modern dance, came to Korea.
p327
aVThe great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport
p328
aVand a reporter asked her a typical question:
p329
aV"What do you have to do to become a great dancer?
p330
aVAny advice for aspiring Korean dancers?"
p331
aVNow, she was the master. This photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist.
p332
aVIn 1990, she was asked this question.
p333
aVAnd here's what she answered:
p334
aV"Just do it."
p335
aVWow. I was touched.
p336
aVOnly those three words and she left the airport. That's it.
p337
aVSo what should we do now?
p338
aVLet's be artists, right now. Right away. How?
p339
aVJust do it!
p340
aa(lp341
VThank you.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)

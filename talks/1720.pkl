VGrowth is not dead.

aa(lp8
VLet's start the story 120 years ago,
p9
aVwhen American factories began to electrify their operations,
p10
aVigniting the Second Industrial Revolution.
p11
aVThe amazing thing is
p12
aVthat productivity did not increase in those factories
p13
aVfor 30 years. Thirty years.
p14
aVThat's long enough for a generation of managers to retire.
p15
aVYou see, the first wave of managers
p16
aVsimply replaced their steam engines with electric motors,
p17
aVbut they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage
p18
aVof electricity's flexibility.
p19
aVIt fell to the next generation to invent new work processes,
p20
aVand then productivity soared,
p21
aVoften doubling or even tripling in those factories.
p22
aa(lp23
VElectricity is an example of a general purpose technology,
p24
aVlike the steam engine before it.
p25
aVGeneral purpose technologies drive most economic growth,
p26
aVbecause they unleash cascades of complementary innovations,
p27
aVlike lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.
p28
aVIs there a general purpose technology of our era?
p29
aVSure. It's the computer.
p30
aVBut technology alone is not enough.
p31
aVTechnology is not destiny.
p32
aVWe shape our destiny,
p33
aVand just as the earlier generations of managers
p34
aVneeded to redesign their factories,
p35
aVwe're going to need to reinvent our organizations
p36
aVand even our whole economic system.
p37
aVWe're not doing as well at that job as we should be.
p38
aVAs we'll see in a moment,
p39
aVproductivity is actually doing all right,
p40
aVbut it has become decoupled from jobs,
p41
aVand the income of the typical worker is stagnating.
p42
aVThese troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed
p43
aVas the end of innovation,
p44
aVbut they are actually the growing pains
p45
aVof what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age.
p46
aa(lp47
VLet's look at some data.
p48
aVSo here's GDP per person in America.
p49
aVThere's some bumps along the way, but the big story
p50
aVis you could practically fit a ruler to it.
p51
aVThis is a log scale, so what looks like steady growth
p52
aVis actually an acceleration in real terms.
p53
aVAnd here's productivity.
p54
aVYou can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid-'70s,
p55
aVbut it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution,
p56
aVwhen factories were learning how to electrify their operations.
p57
aVAfter a lag, productivity accelerated again.
p58
aVSo maybe "history doesn't repeat itself,
p59
aVbut sometimes it rhymes."
p60
aVToday, productivity is at an all-time high,
p61
aVand despite the Great Recession,
p62
aVit grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s,
p63
aVthe roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.
p64
aVIt's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution.
p65
aVAnd that's just the United States.
p66
aVThe global news is even better.
p67
aVWorldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate
p68
aVin the past decade than ever in history.
p69
aa(lp70
VIf anything, all these numbers actually understate our progress,
p71
aVbecause the new machine age
p72
aVis more about knowledge creation
p73
aVthan just physical production.
p74
aVIt's mind not matter, brain not brawn,
p75
aVideas not things.
p76
aVThat creates a problem for standard metrics,
p77
aVbecause we're getting more and more stuff for free,
p78
aVlike Wikipedia, Google, Skype,
p79
aVand if they post it on the web, even this TED Talk.
p80
aVNow getting stuff for free is a good thing, right?
p81
aVSure, of course it is.
p82
aVBut that's not how economists measure GDP.
p83
aVZero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics.
p84
aVAccording to the numbers, the music industry
p85
aVis half the size that it was 10 years ago,
p86
aVbut I'm listening to more and better music than ever.
p87
aVYou know, I bet you are too.
p88
aVIn total, my research estimates
p89
aVthat the GDP numbers miss over 300 billion dollars per year
p90
aVin free goods and services on the Internet.
p91
aVNow let's look to the future.
p92
aVThere are some super smart people
p93
aVwho are arguing that we've reached the end of growth,
p94
aVbut to understand the future of growth,
p95
aVwe need to make predictions
p96
aVabout the underlying drivers of growth.
p97
aVI'm optimistic, because the new machine age
p98
aVis digital, exponential and combinatorial.
p99
aa(lp100
VWhen goods are digital, they can be replicated
p101
aVwith perfect quality at nearly zero cost,
p102
aVand they can be delivered almost instantaneously.
p103
aVWelcome to the economics of abundance.
p104
aVBut there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world.
p105
aVMeasurement is the lifeblood of science and progress.
p106
aVIn the age of big data,
p107
aVwe can measure the world in ways we never could before.
p108
aa(lp109
VSecondly, the new machine age is exponential.
p110
aVComputers get better faster than anything else ever.
p111
aVA child's Playstation today is more powerful
p112
aVthan a military supercomputer from 1996.
p113
aVBut our brains are wired for a linear world.
p114
aVAs a result, exponential trends take us by surprise.
p115
aVI used to teach my students that there are some things,
p116
aVyou know, computers just aren't good at,
p117
aVlike driving a car through traffic.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVThat's right, here's Andy and me grinning like madmen
p120
aVbecause we just rode down Route 101
p121
aVin, yes, a driverless car.
p122
aa(lp123
VThirdly, the new machine age is combinatorial.
p124
aVThe stagnationist view is that ideas get used up,
p125
aVlike low-hanging fruit,
p126
aVbut the reality is that each innovation
p127
aVcreates building blocks for even more innovations.
p128
aVHere's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks,
p129
aVan undergraduate student of mine
p130
aVbuilt an app that ultimately reached 1.3 million users.
p131
aVHe was able to do that so easily
p132
aVbecause he built it on top of Facebook,
p133
aVand Facebook was built on top of the web,
p134
aVand that was built on top of the Internet,
p135
aVand so on and so forth.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow individually, digital, exponential and combinatorial
p138
aVwould each be game-changers.
p139
aVPut them together, and we're seeing a wave
p140
aVof astonishing breakthroughs,
p141
aVlike robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah
p142
aVor leap tall buildings in a single bound.
p143
aVYou know, robots are even revolutionizing
p144
aVcat transportation.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VBut perhaps the most important invention,
p149
aVthe most important invention is machine learning.
p150
aVConsider one project: IBM's Watson.
p151
aVThese little dots here,
p152
aVthose are all the champions on the quiz show "Jeopardy."
p153
aVAt first, Watson wasn't very good,
p154
aVbut it improved at a rate faster than any human could,
p155
aVand shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chart
p156
aVto my class at MIT,
p157
aVWatson beat the world "Jeopardy" champion.
p158
aVAt age seven, Watson is still kind of in its childhood.
p159
aVRecently, its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised.
p160
aVThe next day, it started answering questions with profanities.
p161
aVDamn. (Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VBut you know, Watson is growing up fast.
p164
aVIt's being tested for jobs in call centers, and it's getting them.
p165
aVIt's applying for legal, banking and medical jobs,
p166
aVand getting some of them.
p167
aVIsn't it ironic that at the very moment
p168
aVwe are building intelligent machines,
p169
aVperhaps the most important invention in human history,
p170
aVsome people are arguing that innovation is stagnating?
p171
aVLike the first two industrial revolutions,
p172
aVthe full implications of the new machine age
p173
aVare going to take at least a century to fully play out,
p174
aVbut they are staggering.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo does that mean we have nothing to worry about?
p177
aVNo. Technology is not destiny.
p178
aVProductivity is at an all time high,
p179
aVbut fewer people now have jobs.
p180
aVWe have created more wealth in the past decade than ever,
p181
aVbut for a majority of Americans, their income has fallen.
p182
aVThis is the great decoupling
p183
aVof productivity from employment,
p184
aVof wealth from work.
p185
aVYou know, it's not surprising that millions of people
p186
aVhave become disillusioned by the great decoupling,
p187
aVbut like too many others,
p188
aVthey misunderstand its basic causes.
p189
aVTechnology is racing ahead,
p190
aVbut it's leaving more and more people behind.
p191
aVToday, we can take a routine job,
p192
aVcodify it in a set of machine-readable instructions,
p193
aVand then replicate it a million times.
p194
aa(lp195
VYou know, I recently overheard a conversation
p196
aVthat epitomizes these new economics.
p197
aVThis guy says, "Nah, I don't use H&R Block anymore.
p198
aVTurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did,
p199
aVbut it's faster, cheaper and more accurate."
p200
aVHow can a skilled worker
p201
aVcompete with a $39 piece of software?
p202
aVShe can't.
p203
aVToday, millions of Americans do have faster,
p204
aVcheaper, more accurate tax preparation,
p205
aVand the founders of Intuit
p206
aVhave done very well for themselves.
p207
aVBut 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs.
p208
aVThat is a microcosm of what's happening,
p209
aVnot just in software and services, but in media and music,
p210
aVin finance and manufacturing, in retailing and trade \u2014
p211
aVin short, in every industry.
p212
aVPeople are racing against the machine,
p213
aVand many of them are losing that race.
p214
aa(lp215
VWhat can we do to create shared prosperity?
p216
aVThe answer is not to try to slow down technology.
p217
aVInstead of racing against the machine,
p218
aVwe need to learn to race with the machine.
p219
aVThat is our grand challenge.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe new machine age
p222
aVcan be dated to a day 15 years ago
p223
aVwhen Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion,
p224
aVplayed Deep Blue, a supercomputer.
p225
aVThe machine won that day,
p226
aVand today, a chess program running on a cell phone
p227
aVcan beat a human grandmaster.
p228
aVIt got so bad that, when he was asked
p229
aVwhat strategy he would use against a computer,
p230
aVJan Donner, the Dutch grandmaster, replied,
p231
aV"I'd bring a hammer."
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VBut today a computer is no longer the world chess champion.
p236
aVNeither is a human,
p237
aVbecause Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament
p238
aVwhere teams of humans and computers
p239
aVcould work together,
p240
aVand the winning team had no grandmaster,
p241
aVand it had no supercomputer.
p242
aVWhat they had was better teamwork,
p243
aVand they showed that a team of humans and computers,
p244
aVworking together, could beat any computer
p245
aVor any human working alone.
p246
aVRacing with the machine
p247
aVbeats racing against the machine.
p248
aVTechnology is not destiny.
p249
aVWe shape our destiny.
p250
aa(lp251
VThank you.

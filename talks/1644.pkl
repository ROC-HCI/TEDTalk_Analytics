VHello. My name is Jarrett Krosoczka,
p5
aVand I write and illustrate books for children for a living.
p6
aVSo I use my imagination as my full-time job.
p7
aVBut well before my imagination was my vocation,
p8
aVmy imagination saved my life.
p9
aa(lp10
VWhen I was a kid, I loved to draw,
p11
aVand the most talented artist I knew
p12
aVwas my mother,
p13
aVbut my mother was addicted to heroin.
p14
aVAnd when your parent is a drug addict,
p15
aVit's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football,
p16
aVbecause as much as you want to love on that person,
p17
aVas much as you want to receive love from that person,
p18
aVevery time you open your heart, you end up on your back.
p19
aVSo throughout my childhood, my mother was incarcerated
p20
aVand I didn't have my father because
p21
aVI didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade.
p22
aVBut I had my grandparents,
p23
aVmy maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley,
p24
aVwho adopted me just before my third birthday
p25
aVand took me in as their own,
p26
aVafter they had already raised five children.
p27
aVSo two people who grew up in the Great Depression,
p28
aVthere in the very, very early '80s took on a new kid.
p29
aVI was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom
p30
aVof the Krosoczka family,
p31
aVthe new kid who came out of nowhere.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd I would like to say that life was totally easy with them.
p34
aVThey each smoked two packs a day, each, nonfiltered,
p35
aVand by the time I was six,
p36
aVI could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan,
p37
aVdry with a twist, rocks on the side,
p38
aVthe ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut they loved the hell out of me. They loved me so much.
p41
aVAnd they supported my creative efforts,
p42
aVbecause my grandfather was a self-made man.
p43
aVHe ran and worked in a factory.
p44
aVMy grandmother was a homemaker.
p45
aVBut here was this kid who loved Transformers
p46
aVand Snoopy and the Ninja Turtles,
p47
aVand the characters that I read about, I fell in love with,
p48
aVand they became my friends.
p49
aVSo my best friends in life were the characters
p50
aVI read about in books.
p51
aa(lp52
VI went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester, Massachusetts,
p53
aVand I had wonderful teachers there,
p54
aVmost notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch.
p55
aVAnd I just, I can just remember the love that she offered
p56
aVus as her students.
p57
aa(lp58
VWhen I was in the third grade,
p59
aVa monumental event happened.
p60
aVAn author visited our school, Jack Gantos.
p61
aVA published author of books came to talk to us
p62
aVabout what he did for a living.
p63
aVAnd afterwards, we all went back to our classrooms
p64
aVand we drew our own renditions of his main character,
p65
aVRotten Ralph.
p66
aVAnd suddenly the author appeared in our doorway,
p67
aVand I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles,
p68
aVgoing from kid to kid looking at the desks, not saying a word.
p69
aVBut he stopped next to my desk,
p70
aVand he tapped on my desk, and he said,
p71
aV"Nice cat." (Laughter)
p72
aVAnd he wandered away.
p73
aVTwo words that made a colossal difference in my life.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhen I was in the third grade, I wrote a book for the first time,
p76
aV"The Owl Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer." (Laughter)
p77
aVWe had to write our own Greek myth,
p78
aVour own creation story, so I wrote a story about an owl
p79
aVwho challenged Hermes to a flying race,
p80
aVand the owl cheated,
p81
aVand Hermes, being a Greek god, grew angry and bitter,
p82
aVand turned the owl into a moon,
p83
aVso the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon
p84
aVwhile he watched his family and friends play at night.
p85
aVYeah. (Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VMy book had a title page.
p88
aVI was clearly worried about my intellectual property when I was eight.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVAnd it was a story that was told with words and pictures,
p91
aVexactly what I do now for a living,
p92
aVand I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own,
p93
aVand sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own
p94
aVto tell the story.
p95
aa(lp96
VMy favorite page is the "About the author" page.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVSo I learned to write about myself in third person
p99
aVat a young age.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo I love that last sentence: "He liked making this book."
p102
aVAnd I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination,
p103
aVand that's what writing is.
p104
aVWriting is using your imagination on paper,
p105
aVand I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now
p106
aVand that seems like such a foreign concept to kids,
p107
aVthat writing would be using your imagination on paper,
p108
aVif they're allowed to even write now within the school hours.
p109
aVSo I loved writing so much that I'd come home from school,
p110
aVand I would take out pieces of paper,
p111
aVand I would staple them together,
p112
aVand I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures
p113
aVjust because I loved using my imagination.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd so these characters would become my friends.
p116
aVThere was an egg, a tomato, a head of lettuce and a pumpkin,
p117
aVand they all lived in this refrigerator city,
p118
aVand in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house
p119
aVthat was filled with so many dangers
p120
aVlike an evil blender who tried to chop them up,
p121
aVan evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple,
p122
aVand an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend
p123
aVwho was a stick of butter. (Laughter)
p124
aVAnd I'd make my own comics too,
p125
aVand this was another way for me to tell stories,
p126
aVthrough words and through pictures.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow when I was in sixth grade,
p129
aVthe public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets
p130
aVin the Worcester public school system.
p131
aVI went from having art once a week
p132
aVto twice a month
p133
aVto once a month to not at all.
p134
aVAnd my grandfather, he was a wise man,
p135
aVand he saw that as a problem, because he knew
p136
aVthat was, like, the one thing I had. I didn't play sports.
p137
aVI had art.
p138
aVSo he walked into my room one evening,
p139
aVand he sat on the edge of my bed,
p140
aVand he said, "Jarrett, it's up to you, but if you'd like to,
p141
aVwe'd like to send you to the classes at the Worcester Art Museum."
p142
aVAnd I was so thrilled.
p143
aVSo from sixth through 12th grade,
p144
aVonce, twice, sometimes three times a week,
p145
aVI would take classes at the art museum,
p146
aVand I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw,
p147
aVother kids who shared a similar passion.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow my publishing career began when I designed the cover
p150
aVfor my eighth grade yearbook,
p151
aVand if you're wondering about the style of dress I put our mascot in,
p152
aVI was really into Bell Biv DeVoe and MC Hammer
p153
aVand Vanilla Ice at the time. (Laughter)
p154
aVAnd to this day, I still can do karaoke to "Ice, Ice Baby"
p155
aVwithout looking at the screen.
p156
aVDon't tempt me, because I will do it.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo I get shipped off to private school,
p159
aVK through eight, public schools, but for some reason
p160
aVmy grandfather was upset that somebody
p161
aVat the local high school had been stabbed and killed,
p162
aVso he didn't want me to go there.
p163
aVHe wanted me to go to a private school, and he gave me an option.
p164
aVYou can go to Holy Name, which is coed,
p165
aVor St. John's, which is all boys.
p166
aVVery wise man, because he knew I would,
p167
aVI felt like I was making the decision on my own,
p168
aVand he knew I wouldn't choose St. John's,
p169
aVso I went to Holy Name High School,
p170
aVwhich was a tough transition because, like I said,
p171
aVI didn't play sports,
p172
aVand it was very focused on sports,
p173
aVbut I took solace in Mr. Shilale's art room.
p174
aVAnd I just flourished here.
p175
aVI just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo how did I make friends?
p178
aVI drew funny pictures of my teachers \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p179
aVand I passed them around.
p180
aVWell, in English class, in ninth grade,
p181
aVmy friend John, who was sitting next to me,
p182
aVlaughed a little bit too hard.
p183
aVMr. Greenwood was not pleased.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aVHe instantly saw that I was the cause of the commotion,
p186
aVand for the first time in my life, I was sent to the hall,
p187
aVand I thought, "Oh no, I'm doomed.
p188
aVMy grandfather's just going to kill me."
p189
aVAnd he came out to the hallway and he said,
p190
aV"Let me see the paper."
p191
aVAnd I thought, "Oh no. He thinks it's a note."
p192
aVAnd so I took this picture, and I handed it to him.
p193
aVAnd we sat in silence for that brief moment,
p194
aVand he said to me,
p195
aV"You're really talented." (Laughter)
p196
aV"You're really good. You know, the school newspaper
p197
aVneeds a new cartoonist, and you should be the cartoonist.
p198
aVJust stop drawing in my class."
p199
aa(lp200
VSo my parents never found out about it.
p201
aVI didn't get in trouble. I was introduced to Mrs. Casey,
p202
aVwho ran the school newspaper,
p203
aVand I was for three and a half years
p204
aVthe cartoonist for my school paper,
p205
aVhandling such heavy issues as,
p206
aVseniors are mean,
p207
aVfreshmen are nerds,
p208
aVthe prom bill is so expensive. I can't believe how much it costs to go to the prom.
p209
aVAnd I took the headmaster to task
p210
aVand then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley
p211
aVwho was unlucky in love, and I just swore up and down
p212
aVthat this wasn't about me,
p213
aVbut all these years later it was totally me.
p214
aa(lp215
VBut it was so cool because I could write these stories,
p216
aVI could come up with these ideas,
p217
aVand they'd be published in the school paper,
p218
aVand people who I didn't know could read them.
p219
aVAnd I loved that thought, of being able to share my ideas
p220
aVthrough the printed page.
p221
aa(lp222
VOn my 14th birthday, my grandfather and my grandmother
p223
aVgave me the best birthday present ever:
p224
aVa drafting table that I have worked on ever since.
p225
aVHere I am, 20 years later,
p226
aVand I still work on this table every day.
p227
aVOn the evening of my 14th birthday,
p228
aVI was given this table, and we had Chinese food.
p229
aVAnd this was my fortune:
p230
aV"You will be successful in your work."
p231
aVI taped it to the top left hand of my table,
p232
aVand as you can see, it's still there.
p233
aVNow I never really asked my grandparents for anything.
p234
aVWell, two things: Rusty, who was a great hamster
p235
aVand lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVAnd a video camera.
p238
aVI just wanted a video camera.
p239
aVAnd after begging and pleading for Christmas,
p240
aVI got a second-hand video camera,
p241
aVand I instantly started making my own animations
p242
aVon my own,
p243
aVand all throughout high school I made my own animations.
p244
aVI convinced my 10th grade English teacher to allow me
p245
aVto do my book report on Stephen King's "Misery"
p246
aVas an animated short. (Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd I kept making comics.
p249
aVI kept making comics, and at the Worcester Art Museum,
p250
aVI was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given.
p251
aVMark Lynch, he's an amazing teacher
p252
aVand he's still a dear friend of mine,
p253
aVand I was 14 or 15,
p254
aVand I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course,
p255
aVand I was so excited, I was beaming.
p256
aVI had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way,
p257
aVand it taught me how to draw superheroes,
p258
aVhow to draw a woman, how to draw muscles
p259
aVjust the way they were supposed to be
p260
aVif I were to ever draw for X-Men or Spiderman.
p261
aVAnd all the color just drained from his face,
p262
aVand he looked at me, and he said,
p263
aV"Forget everything you learned."
p264
aVAnd I didn't understand. He said, "You have a great style.
p265
aVCelebrate your own style. Don't draw the way you're being told to draw.
p266
aVDraw the way you're drawing and keep at it,
p267
aVbecause you're really good."
p268
aa(lp269
VNow when I was a teenager, I was angsty as any teenager was,
p270
aVbut after 17 years of having a mother
p271
aVwho was in and out of my life like a yo-yo
p272
aVand a father who was faceless, I was angry.
p273
aVAnd when I was 17, I met my father for the first time,
p274
aVupon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about.
p275
aVAnd on the day I met my father for the first time,
p276
aVI was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design,
p277
aVmy one and only choice for college.
p278
aa(lp279
VBut it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine
p280
aVto volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids,
p281
aVkids with leukemia, and this kid Eric changed my life.
p282
aVEric didn't live to see his sixth birthday,
p283
aVand Eric lives with me every day.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo after this experience, my art teacher, Mr. Shilale,
p286
aVhe brought in these picture books,
p287
aVand I thought, "Picture books for kids!"
p288
aVand I started writing books for young readers
p289
aVwhen I was a senior in high school.
p290
aVWell, I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design.
p291
aVI transferred to RISD as a sophomore,
p292
aVand it was there that I took every course that I could on writing,
p293
aVand it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug
p294
aVwho wanted to be friends with this kid.
p295
aVThe kid had no patience for him.
p296
aVAnd I sent this book out to a dozen publishers
p297
aVand it was rejected every single time,
p298
aVbut I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp,
p299
aVan amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses,
p300
aVand it's those kids at the camp that read my stories,
p301
aVand I read to them, and I saw that they responded to my work.
p302
aa(lp303
VI graduated from RISD. My grandparents were very proud,
p304
aVand I moved to Boston, and I set up shop.
p305
aVI set up a studio and I tried to get published.
p306
aVI would send out my books. I would send out hundreds of postcards
p307
aVto editors and art directors,
p308
aVbut they would go unanswered.
p309
aVAnd my grandfather would call me every week,
p310
aVand he would say, "Jarrett, how's it going? Do you have a job yet?"
p311
aVBecause he had just invested a significant amount of money
p312
aVin my college education.
p313
aVAnd I said, "Yes, I have a job. I write and illustrate children's books."
p314
aVAnd he said, "Well, who pays you for that?"
p315
aVAnd I said, "No one, no one, no one just yet.
p316
aVBut I know it's going to happen."
p317
aa(lp318
VNow, I used to work the weekends at the Hole in the Wall off-season programming
p319
aVto make some extra money as I was trying to get my feet off the ground,
p320
aVand this kid who was just this really hyper kid,
p321
aVI started calling him "Monkey Boy,"
p322
aVand I went home and wrote a book called "Good Night, Monkey Boy."
p323
aVAnd I sent out one last batch of postcards.
p324
aVAnd I received an email from an editor at Random House
p325
aVwith a subject line, "Nice work!" Exclamation point.
p326
aa(lp327
V"Dear Jarrett, I received your postcard.
p328
aVI liked your art, so I went to your website
p329
aVand I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories,
p330
aVbecause I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them.
p331
aVPlease let me know if you're ever in New York City."
p332
aVAnd this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo the next week I "happened" to be in New York.
p335
aV(Laughter)
p336
aVAnd I met with this editor,
p337
aVand I left New York for a contract for my first book,
p338
aV"Good Night, Monkey Boy,"
p339
aVwhich was published on June 12, 2001.
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd my local paper celebrated the news.
p342
aVThe local bookstore made a big deal of it.
p343
aVThey sold out of all of their books.
p344
aVMy friend described it as a wake, but happy,
p345
aVbecause everyone I ever knew was there in line to see me,
p346
aVbut I wasn't dead. I was just signing books.
p347
aVMy grandparents, they were in the middle of it.
p348
aVThey were so happy. They couldn't have been more proud.
p349
aVMrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there.
p350
aVMrs. Alisch cut in front of the line and said,
p351
aV"I taught him how to read." (Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd then something happened that changed my life.
p354
aVI got my first piece of significant fan mail,
p355
aVwhere this kid loved Monkey Boy so much
p356
aVthat he wanted to have a Monkey Boy birthday cake.
p357
aVFor a two-year-old, that is like a tattoo. (Laughter)
p358
aVYou know? You only get one birthday per year.
p359
aVAnd for him, it's only his second.
p360
aVAnd I got this picture, and I thought,
p361
aV"This picture is going to live within his consciousness
p362
aVfor his entire life. He will forever have this photo
p363
aVin his family photo albums."
p364
aa(lp365
VSo that photo, since that moment,
p366
aVis framed in front of me while I've worked on all of my books.
p367
aa(lp368
VI have 10 picture books out.
p369
aV"Punk Farm," "Baghead," "Ollie the Purple Elephant."
p370
aVI just finished the ninth book
p371
aVin the "Lunch Lady" series, which is a graphic novel series
p372
aVabout a lunch lady who fights crime.
p373
aVI'm expecting the release of a chapter book
p374
aVcalled "Platypus Police Squad: The Frog Who Croaked."
p375
aVAnd I travel the country visiting countless schools,
p376
aVletting lots of kids know that they draw great cats.
p377
aa(lp378
VAnd I meet Bagheads.
p379
aVLunch ladies treat me really well.
p380
aVAnd I got to see my name in lights
p381
aVbecause kids put my name in lights.
p382
aVTwice now, the "Lunch Lady" series has won
p383
aVthe Children's Choice Book of the Year in the third or fourth grade category,
p384
aVand those winners were displayed
p385
aVon a jumbotron screen in Times Square.
p386
aV"Punk Farm" and "Lunch Lady" are in development to be movies,
p387
aVso I am a movie producer
p388
aVand I really do think, thanks to that video camera
p389
aVI was given in ninth grade.
p390
aVI've seen people have "Punk Farm" birthday parties,
p391
aVpeople have dressed up as "Punk Farm" for Halloween,
p392
aVa "Punk Farm" baby room,
p393
aVwhich makes me a little nervous for the child's well-being in the long term.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd I get the most amazing fan mail,
p396
aVand I get the most amazing projects,
p397
aVand the biggest moment for me came last Halloween.
p398
aVThe doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater
p399
aVdressed as my character. It was so cool.
p400
aa(lp401
VNow my grandparents are no longer living,
p402
aVso to honor them, I started a scholarship at the Worcester Art Museum
p403
aVfor kids who are in difficult situations
p404
aVbut whose caretakers can't afford the classes.
p405
aVAnd it displayed the work from my first 10 years of publishing,
p406
aVand you know who was there to celebrate? Mrs. Alisch.
p407
aa(lp408
VI said, "Mrs. Alisch, how are you?"
p409
aa(lp410
VAnd she responded with, "I'm here." (Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
VThat's true. You are alive, and that's pretty good right now.
p413
aa(lp414
VSo the biggest moment for me, though,
p415
aVmy most important job now is I am a dad myself,
p416
aVand I have two beautiful daughters,
p417
aVand my goal is to surround them by inspiration,
p418
aVby the books that are in every single room of our house
p419
aVto the murals I painted in their rooms
p420
aVto the moments for creativity where you find, in quiet times,
p421
aVby making faces on the patio
p422
aVto letting her sit in the very desk
p423
aVthat I've sat in for the past 20 years.
p424
aVThank you. (Applause)

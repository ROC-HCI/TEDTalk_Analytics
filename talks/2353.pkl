VSo this right here
p5
aVis the tiny village of Elle, close to Lista.
p6
aVIt's right at the southernmost tip of Norway.
p7
aVAnd on January 2 this year,
p8
aVan elderly guy who lives in the village,
p9
aVhe went out to see what was cast ashore
p10
aVduring a recent storm.
p11
aVAnd on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge,
p12
aVhe found a wetsuit.
p13
aVIt was grey and black, and he thought it looked cheap.
p14
aVOut of each leg of the wetsuit
p15
aVthere were sticking two white bones.
p16
aVIt was clearly the remains of a human being.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd usually, in Norway, dead people are identified quickly.
p19
aVSo the police started searching
p20
aVthrough missing reports from the local area,
p21
aVnational missing reports,
p22
aVand looked for accidents with a possible connection.
p23
aVThey found nothing.
p24
aVSo they ran a DNA profile,
p25
aVand they started searching internationally through Interpol.
p26
aVNothing.
p27
aVThis was a person that nobody seemed to be missing.
p28
aVIt was an invisible life heading for a nameless grave.
p29
aVBut then, after a month,
p30
aVthe police in Norway got a message from the police in the Netherlands.
p31
aVA couple of months earlier, they had found a body,
p32
aVin an identical wetsuit, and they had no idea who this person was.
p33
aVBut the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the wetsuit
p34
aVby an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit.
p35
aVSo they were then able to tell
p36
aVthat both wetsuits were bought by the same customer at the same time,
p37
aVOctober 7, 2014,
p38
aVin the French city of Calais by the English Channel.
p39
aVBut this was all they were able to figure out.
p40
aVThe customer paid cash.
p41
aVThere was no surveillance footage from the shop.
p42
aVSo it became a cold case.
p43
aa(lp44
VWe heard this story,
p45
aVand it triggered me and my colleague, photographer Tomm Christiansen,
p46
aVand we of course had the obvious question: who were these people?
p47
aVAt the time, I'd barely heard about Calais,
p48
aVbut it took about two or three seconds to figure out
p49
aVCalais is basically known for two things.
p50
aVIt's the spot in continental Europe closest to Britain,
p51
aVand a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp
p52
aVand are trying desperately to cross over to Britain.
p53
aVAnd right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people,
p54
aVand the police made this theory as well.
p55
aVBecause if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe
p56
aVgoes missing off the coast of France, people would just know.
p57
aVYour friends or family would report you missing,
p58
aVthe police would come search for you, the media would know,
p59
aVand there would be pictures of you on lampposts.
p60
aVIt's difficult to disappear without a trace.
p61
aVBut if you just fled the war in Syria,
p62
aVand your family, if you have any family left,
p63
aVdon't necessarily know where you are,
p64
aVand you're staying here illegally
p65
aVamongst thousands of others who come and go every day.
p66
aVWell, if you disappear one day, nobody will notice.
p67
aVThe police won't come search for you because nobody knows you're gone.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd this is what happened to Shadi Omar Kataf
p70
aVand Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.
p71
aa(lp72
VMe and Tomm went to Calais for the first time in April this year,
p73
aVand after three months of investigation, we were able to tell the story
p74
aVabout how these two young men fled the war in Syria,
p75
aVended up stuck in Calais,
p76
aVbought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt
p77
aVto swim across the English Channel in order to reach England.
p78
aVIt is a story about the fact that everybody has a name,
p79
aVeverybody has a story, everybody is someone.
p80
aVBut it is also a story about what it's like to be a refugee in Europe today.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo this is where we started our search.
p83
aVThis is in Calais.
p84
aVRight now, between 3,500 and 5,000 people are living here
p85
aVunder horrible conditions.
p86
aVIt has been dubbed the worst refugee camp in Europe.
p87
aVLimited access to food, limited access to water,
p88
aVlimited access to health care.
p89
aVDisease and infections are widespread.
p90
aVAnd they're all stuck here because they're trying to get to England
p91
aVin order to claim asylum.
p92
aVAnd they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry,
p93
aVor the Eurotunnel,
p94
aVor they sneak inside the tunnel terminal at night
p95
aVto try to hide on the trains.
p96
aa(lp97
VMost want to go to Britain because they know the language,
p98
aVand so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from there.
p99
aVThey want to work, they want to study,
p100
aVthey want to be able to continue their lives.
p101
aVA lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers.
p102
aVIf you go to Calais and talk to refugees, you'll meet lawyers, politicians,
p103
aVengineers, graphic designers, farmers, soldiers.
p104
aVYou've got the whole spectrum.
p105
aVBut who all of these people are
p106
aVusually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants,
p107
aVbecause we usually do that in statistics.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo you have 60 million refugees globally.
p110
aVAbout half a million have made the crossing
p111
aVover the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year,
p112
aVand roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais.
p113
aVBut these are numbers,
p114
aVand the numbers don't say anything about who these people are,
p115
aVwhere they came from, or why they're here.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd first, I want to tell you about one of them.
p118
aVThis is 22-year-old Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.
p119
aVWe first heard about him after being in Calais the first time
p120
aVlooking for answers to the theory of the two dead bodies.
p121
aVAnd after a while, we heard this story
p122
aVabout a Syrian man who was living in Bradford in England,
p123
aVand had been desperately searching for his nephew Mouaz for months.
p124
aVAnd it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mouaz
p125
aVwas October 7, 2014.
p126
aVThat was the same date the wetsuits were bought.
p127
aVSo we flew over there and we met the uncle
p128
aVand we did DNA samples of him,
p129
aVand later on got additional DNA samples from Mouaz's closest relative
p130
aVwho now lives in Jordan.
p131
aVThe analysis concluded
p132
aVthe body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the Netherlands
p133
aVwas actually Mouaz Al Balkhi.
p134
aVAnd while we were doing all this investigation,
p135
aVwe got to know Mouaz's story.
p136
aVHe was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus in 1991.
p137
aVHe was raised in a middle class family,
p138
aVand his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer
p139
aVwho spent 11 years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in Syria.
p140
aVWhile his father was in prison,
p141
aVMouaz took responsibility and he cared for his three sisters.
p142
aVThey said he was that kind of guy.
p143
aVMouaz studied to become an electrical engineer
p144
aVat the University of Damascus.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo a couple of years into the Syrian war,
p147
aVthe family fled Damascus and went to the neighboring country, Jordan.
p148
aVTheir father had problems finding work in Jordan,
p149
aVand Mouaz could not continue his studies,
p150
aVso he figured, "OK, the best thing I can do to help my family
p151
aVwould be to go somewhere where I can finish my studies
p152
aVand find work."
p153
aVSo he goes to Turkey.
p154
aa(lp155
VIn Turkey, he's not accepted at a university,
p156
aVand once he had left Jordan as a refugee, he was not allowed to reenter.
p157
aVSo then he decides to head for the UK,
p158
aVwhere his uncle lives.
p159
aVHe makes it into Algeria, walks into Libya,
p160
aVpays a people smuggler to help him with the crossing into Italy by boat,
p161
aVand from there on he heads to Dunkirk,
p162
aVthe city right next to Calais by the English Channel.
p163
aVWe know he made at least 12 failed attempts to cross the English Channel
p164
aVby hiding in a truck.
p165
aVBut at some point, he must have given up all hope.
p166
aVThe last night we know he was alive,
p167
aVhe spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk.
p168
aVWe found his name in the records, and he seems to have stayed there alone.
p169
aVThe day after, he went into Calais, entered a sports shop
p170
aVa couple of minutes before 8 o'clock in the evening,
p171
aValong with Shadi Kataf.
p172
aVThey both bought wetsuits,
p173
aVand the woman in the shop
p174
aVwas the last person we know of to have seen them alive.
p175
aVWe have tried to figure out where Shadi met Mouaz,
p176
aVbut we weren't able to do that.
p177
aVBut they do have a similar story.
p178
aVWe first heard about Shadi after a cousin of his, living in Germany,
p179
aVhad read an Arabic translation of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook.
p180
aVSo we got in touch with him.
p181
aVShadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz,
p182
aVwas also raised in Damascus.
p183
aVHe was a working kind of guy.
p184
aVHe ran a tire repair shop and later worked in a printing company.
p185
aVHe lived with his extended family,
p186
aVbut their house got bombed early in the war.
p187
aVSo the family fled to an area of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk.
p188
aa(lp189
VYarmouk is being described as the worst place to live
p190
aVon planet Earth.
p191
aVThey've been bombed by the military, they've been besieged,
p192
aVthey've been stormed by ISIS
p193
aVand they've been cut off from supplies for years.
p194
aVThere was a UN official who visited last year,
p195
aVand he said, "They ate all the grass so there was no grass left."
p196
aVOut of a population of 150,000,
p197
aVonly 18,000 are believed to still be left in Yarmouk.
p198
aVShadi and his sisters got out.
p199
aVThe parents are still stuck inside.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo Shadi and one of his sisters, they fled to Libya.
p202
aVThis was after the fall of Gaddafi,
p203
aVbut before Libya turned into full-blown civil war.
p204
aVAnd in this last remaining sort of stability in Libya,
p205
aVShadi took up scuba diving, and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater.
p206
aVHe fell completely in love with the ocean,
p207
aVso when he finally decided that he could no longer be in Libya,
p208
aVlate August 2014,
p209
aVhe hoped to find work as a diver when he reached Italy.
p210
aVReality was not that easy.
p211
aVWe don't know much about his travels
p212
aVbecause he had a hard time communicating with his family,
p213
aVbut we do know that he struggled.
p214
aVAnd by the end of September,
p215
aVhe was living on the streets somewhere in France.
p216
aVOn October 7, he calls his cousin in Belgium,
p217
aVand explains his situation.
p218
aVHe said, "I'm in Calais. I need you to come get my backpack and my laptop.
p219
aVI can't afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to Britain,
p220
aVbut I will go buy a wetsuit and I will swim."
p221
aVHis cousin, of course, tried to warn him not to,
p222
aVbut Shadi's battery on the phone went flat,
p223
aVand his phone was never switched on again.
p224
aVWhat was left of Shadi was found nearly three months later,
p225
aV800 kilometers away
p226
aVin a wetsuit on a beach in Norway.
p227
aVHe's still waiting for his funeral in Norway,
p228
aVand none of his family will be able to attend.
p229
aa(lp230
VMany may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz
p231
aVis a story about death,
p232
aVbut I don't agree.
p233
aVTo me, this is a story about two questions that I think we all share:
p234
aVwhat is a better life,
p235
aVand what am I willing to do to achieve it?
p236
aVAnd to me, and probably a lot of you,
p237
aVa better life would mean
p238
aVbeing able to do more of what we think of as meaningful,
p239
aVwhether that be spending more time with your family and friends,
p240
aVtravel to an exotic place,
p241
aVor just getting money to buy that cool new device
p242
aVor a pair of new sneakers.
p243
aVAnd this is all within our reach pretty easily.
p244
aa(lp245
VBut if you are fleeing a war zone,
p246
aVthe answers to those two questions are dramatically different.
p247
aVA better life is a life in safety.
p248
aVIt's a life in dignity.
p249
aVA better life means not having your house bombed,
p250
aVnot fearing being kidnapped.
p251
aVIt means being able to send your children to school,
p252
aVgo to university,
p253
aVor just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love.
p254
aVA better life would be a future of some possibilities
p255
aVcompared to nearly none,
p256
aVand that's a strong motivation.
p257
aVAnd I have no trouble imagining
p258
aVthat after spending weeks or even months
p259
aVas a second-grade citizen,
p260
aVliving on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp
p261
aVwith a stupid, racist name like "The Jungle,"
p262
aVmost of us would be willing to do just about anything.
p263
aVIf I could ask Shadi and Mouaz
p264
aVthe second they stepped into the freezing waters of the English Channel,
p265
aVthey would probably say, "This is worth the risk,"
p266
aVbecause they could no longer see any other option.
p267
aVAnd that's desperation,
p268
aVbut that's the reality of living as a refugee in Western Europe in 2015.
p269
aa(lp270
VThank you.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Anders.
p275
aVThis is Tomm Christiansen,
p276
aVwho took most of the pictures you have seen and they've done reporting together.
p277
aVTomm, you two have been back to Calais recently.
p278
aVThis was the third trip.
p279
aVIt was after the publication of the article.
p280
aVWhat has changed? What have you seen there?
p281
aa(lp282
VTomm Christiansen: The first time we were in Calais,
p283
aVit was about 1,500 refugees there.
p284
aVThey had a difficult time, but they were positive, they had hope.
p285
aVThe last time, the camp has grown, maybe four or five thousand people.
p286
aVIt seemed more permanent, NGOs have arrived,
p287
aVa small school has opened.
p288
aVBut the thing is that the refugees have stayed for a longer time,
p289
aVand the French government has managed to seal off the borders better,
p290
aVso now The Jungle is growing,
p291
aValong with the despair and hopelessness among the refugees.
p292
aa(lp293
VBG: Are you planning to go back? And continue the reporting?
p294
aa(lp295
VTC: Yes.
p296
aa(lp297
VBG: Anders, I'm a former journalist,
p298
aVand to me, it's amazing that in the current climate
p299
aVof slashing budgets and publishers in crisis,
p300
aVDagbladet has consented so many resources for this story,
p301
aVwhich tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility,
p302
aVbut how did you sell it to your editors?
p303
aa(lp304
VAnders Fjellberg: It wasn't easy at first,
p305
aVbecause we weren't able to know what we actually could figure out.
p306
aVAs soon as it became clear
p307
aVthat we actually could be able to identify who the first one was,
p308
aVwe basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted,
p309
aVjust travel wherever you need to go, do whatever you need to do,
p310
aVjust get this done.
p311
aa(lp312
VBG: That's an editor taking responsibility.
p313
aVThe story, by the way, has been translated and published
p314
aVacross several European countries, and certainly will continue to do.
p315
aVAnd we want to read the updates from you. Thank you Anders. Thank you Tomm.

VWell, I learned a lot of things about ballooning,
p5
aVespecially at the end of these balloon flights
p6
aVaround the world I did with Brian Jones.
p7
aVWhen I took this picture,
p8
aVthe window was frozen because of the moisture of the night.
p9
aVAnd on the other side there was a rising sun.
p10
aVSo, you see that on the other side of ice
p11
aVyou have the unknown,
p12
aVyou have the non-obvious,
p13
aVyou have the non-seen,
p14
aVfor the people who don't dare
p15
aVto go through the ice.
p16
aa(lp17
VThere are so many people
p18
aVwho prefer to suffer in the ice they know
p19
aVinstead of taking the risk of going through the ice
p20
aVto see what there is on the other side.
p21
aVAnd I think that's one of the main problems of our society.
p22
aVWe learn, maybe not the famous TED audience,
p23
aVbut so many other people learn,
p24
aVthat the unknown, the doubts,
p25
aVthe question marks are dangerous.
p26
aVAnd we have to resist to the changes.
p27
aVWe have to keep everything under control.
p28
aVWell, the unknown is part of life.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor.
p31
aVBecause in the balloon, like in life,
p32
aVwe go very well in unforeseen directions.
p33
aVWe want to go in a direction,
p34
aVbut the winds push us in another direction, like in life.
p35
aVAnd as long as we fight horizontally,
p36
aVagainst life, against the winds,
p37
aVagainst what's happening to us,
p38
aVlife is a nightmare.
p39
aa(lp40
VHow do we steer a balloon?
p41
aVBy understanding that the atmosphere
p42
aVis made out of several different layers of wind
p43
aVwhich all have different direction.
p44
aVSo, then, we understand that if we want to change our trajectory,
p45
aVin life, or in the balloon,
p46
aVwe have to change altitude.
p47
aVChanging altitude, in life,
p48
aVthat means raising to another psychological, philosophical,
p49
aVspiritual level.
p50
aVBut how do we do that?
p51
aa(lp52
VIn ballooning, or in life,
p53
aVhow do we change altitude?
p54
aVHow do we go from the metaphor
p55
aVto something more practical that we can really
p56
aVuse every day?
p57
aVWell, in a balloon it's easy, we have ballast.
p58
aVAnd when we drop the ballast overboard we climb.
p59
aVSand, water, all the equipment we don't need anymore.
p60
aVAnd I think in life it should be exactly like this.
p61
aa(lp62
VYou know, when people speak about pioneering spirit,
p63
aVvery often they believe that pioneers
p64
aVare the ones who have new ideas.
p65
aVIt's not true.
p66
aVThe pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas,
p67
aVbecause new ideas are so easy to have.
p68
aVWe just close our eyes for a minute we all come back
p69
aVwith a lot of new ideas.
p70
aVNo, the pioneer is the one who
p71
aVallows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast.
p72
aVHabits, certainties,
p73
aVconvictions, exclamation marks,
p74
aVparadigms, dogmas.
p75
aVAnd when we are able to do that,
p76
aVwhat happens?
p77
aVLife is not anymore
p78
aVjust one line going in one direction
p79
aVin one dimension. No.
p80
aVLife is going to be made out of all the possible lines
p81
aVthat go in all the possible directions
p82
aVin three dimensions.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves
p85
aVto explore this vertical axis.
p86
aVOf course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon,
p87
aVbut in life itself.
p88
aVExplore this vertical axis, that means
p89
aVexplore all the different ways to do,
p90
aVall the different ways to behave, all the different ways to think,
p91
aVbefore we find the one that goes in the direction we wish.
p92
aVThis is very practical.
p93
aVThis can be in politics.
p94
aVThis can be in spirituality.
p95
aVThis can be in environment,
p96
aVin finance, in education of children.
p97
aa(lp98
VI deeply believe
p99
aVthat life is a much greater adventure
p100
aVif we manage to do politics
p101
aVwithout the trench between the left and the right wing.
p102
aVBecause we will throw away these political dogmas.
p103
aVI deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment
p104
aVif we get rid \u2014 if we throw overboard
p105
aVthis fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past.
p106
aVAnd that we can aim for much higher spirituality
p107
aVif we get rid of the religious dogmas.
p108
aVThrowing overboard, as ballast, to change our direction.
p109
aa(lp110
VWell, these basically are things I believed in such a long time.
p111
aVBut actually I had to go around the world in a balloon
p112
aVto be invited to talk about it.
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aV(Applause)
p115
aVIt's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop
p116
aVand which altitude to take. Sometime we need
p117
aVfriends, family members or a psychiatrist.
p118
aVWell, in balloons we need weather men,
p119
aVthe one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind,
p120
aVat which altitude, in order to help the balloonist.
p121
aVBut sometimes it's very paradoxical.
p122
aa(lp123
VWhen Brian Jones and I were flying around the world,
p124
aVthe weather man asked us, one day, to fly
p125
aVquite low, and very slow.
p126
aVAnd when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it
p127
aVaround the world at that speed.
p128
aVSo, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd I was so proud to have found that jetstream
p131
aVthat I called the weather man,
p132
aVand I told him, "Hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there?
p133
aVWe fly twice the speed you predicted."
p134
aVAnd he told me, "Don't do that. Go down immediately
p135
aVin order to slow down."
p136
aVAnd I started to argue. I said, "I'm not going to do that.
p137
aVWe don't have enough gas to fly so slow."
p138
aVAnd he told me, "Yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left
p139
aVif you fly too fast, in a couple of hours
p140
aVyou will turn left and end up at the North Pole.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aVAnd then he asked me \u2014
p143
aVand this is something I will never forget in my life \u2014
p144
aVhe just asked me, "You're the good pilot up there.
p145
aVWhat do you really want? You want to go very fast
p146
aVin the wrong direction, or slowly in the good direction?
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aV(Applause)
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd this is why you need weathermen.
p151
aVThis is why you need people with long-term vision.
p152
aVAnd this is precisely what fails
p153
aVin the political visions we have now,
p154
aVin the political governments.
p155
aVWe are burning, as you heard,
p156
aVso much energy,
p157
aVnot understanding that such an unsustainable
p158
aVway of life cannot last for long.
p159
aVSo, we went down actually.
p160
aVWe slowed down. And we went through moments of fears
p161
aVbecause we had no idea how the little amount of gas
p162
aVwe had in the balloon
p163
aVcould allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers.
p164
aVBut we were expected to have doubts; we're expected to have fears.
p165
aVAnd actually this is where the adventure really started.
p166
aa(lp167
VWhen we were flying over the Sahara and India
p168
aVit was nice holidays.
p169
aVWe could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane.
p170
aVIn the middle of the Pacific,
p171
aVwhen you don't have the good winds, you cannot land,
p172
aVyou cannot go back.
p173
aVThat's a crisis.
p174
aVThat's the moment when you have to wake up
p175
aVfrom the automatic way of thinking.
p176
aVThat's the moment when you have to motivate
p177
aVyour inner potential,
p178
aVyour creativity.
p179
aVThat's when you throw out all the ballast,
p180
aVall the certainties,
p181
aVin order to adapt to the new situation.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd actually, we changed completely our flight plan.
p184
aVWe changed completely our strategy.
p185
aVAnd after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt.
p186
aVBut if I show you this picture
p187
aVit's not to tell you how happy we were.
p188
aVIt's to show you how much gas was left
p189
aVin the last bottles.
p190
aVWe took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane.
p191
aVWe landed with 40 kilos.
p192
aa(lp193
VWhen I saw that, I made a promise to myself.
p194
aVI made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world,
p195
aVit would be with no fuel,
p196
aVindependent from fossil energies,
p197
aVin order to be safe,
p198
aVnot to be threatened by the fuel gauge.
p199
aVI had no idea how it was possible.
p200
aVI just thought it's a dream and I want to do it.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd when the capsule of my balloon was introduced
p203
aVofficially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington,
p204
aVtogether with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh,
p205
aVwith Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' Flyer,
p206
aVwith Chuck Yeager's 61,
p207
aVI had really a thought then.
p208
aVI thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant.
p209
aVIt allowed to do all those things there.
p210
aVBut it will not be possible in the future any more.
p211
aVIt takes too much energy. It will cost too much.
p212
aVIt will be prohibited
p213
aVbecause we'll have to save our natural resources
p214
aVin a few decades from now.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo how can we perpetuate
p217
aVthis pioneering spirit
p218
aVwith something that will be independent from fossil energy?
p219
aVAnd this is when the project Solar Impulse
p220
aVreally started to
p221
aVturn in my head.
p222
aVAnd I think it's a nice metaphor also
p223
aVfor the 21st century.
p224
aVPioneering spirit should continue, but on another level.
p225
aVNot to conquer the planet or space,
p226
aVnot anymore, it has been done,
p227
aVbut rather to improve the quality of life.
p228
aVHow can we go through the ice of certainty
p229
aVin order to make the most incredible a possible thing?
p230
aVWhat is today completely impossible \u2014
p231
aVget rid of our dependency on fossil energy.
p232
aa(lp233
VIf you tell to people, we want to be independent
p234
aVfrom fossil energy in our world,
p235
aVpeople will laugh at you, except here,
p236
aVwhere crazy people are invited to speak.
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVSo, the idea is that if we fly around the world
p239
aVin a solar powered airplane,
p240
aVusing absolutely no fuel,
p241
aVnobody ever could say in the future
p242
aVthat it's impossible to do it
p243
aVfor cars, for heating systems,
p244
aVfor computers, and so on and so on.
p245
aa(lp246
VWell, solar power airplanes are not new.
p247
aVThey have flown in the past, but without
p248
aVsaving capabilities, without batteries.
p249
aVWhich means that they have more proven
p250
aVthe limits of renewable energies
p251
aVthan the potential of it.
p252
aVIf we want to show the potential,
p253
aVwe have to fly day and night.
p254
aVThat means to load the batteries during the flight,
p255
aVin order to spend the night on the batteries,
p256
aVand fly the next day again.
p257
aVIt has been made, already, on remote controlled
p258
aVlittle airplane models, without pilots.
p259
aa(lp260
VBut it stays an anecdote
p261
aVbecause the public couldn't identify to it.
p262
aVI think you need a pilot in the plane
p263
aVthat can talk to the universities,
p264
aVthat can talk to students,
p265
aVtalk to politicians during the flight,
p266
aVand really make it a human adventure.
p267
aVFor that, unfortunately,
p268
aVfour meters wingspan is not enough.
p269
aVYou need 64 meter wingspan.
p270
aV64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot, the batteries,
p271
aVflies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency.
p272
aVWhy that? Because fuel is not easy to replace.
p273
aVThat's for sure.
p274
aVAnd with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane,
p275
aVwe can produce the same energy
p276
aVthan 200 little lightbulbs.
p277
aVThat means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo the question is, how can you carry a pilot around the world
p280
aVwith an airplane that uses
p281
aVthe same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree?
p282
aVPeople will tell you it's impossible,
p283
aVand that's exactly why we try to do it.
p284
aVWe launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg
p285
aVsix years ago.
p286
aVWe have now 70 people in the team working on it.
p287
aVWe have gone through the stages of simulation, design,
p288
aVcomputing, preparing the construction
p289
aVof the first prototype.
p290
aVThat has been achieved after two years of work.
p291
aVCockpit, propeller, engine.
p292
aVJust the fuselage here, it's so light.
p293
aVIt's not designed by an artist, but it could be.
p294
aV50 kilos for the entire fuselage.
p295
aVCouple of kilos more for the wing spars.
p296
aa(lp297
VThis is the complete structure of the airplane.
p298
aVAnd one month ago we have unveiled it.
p299
aVYou cannot imagine how it is for a team
p300
aVwho has been working six years on it
p301
aVto show that it's not only a dream and a vision,
p302
aVit's a real airplane.
p303
aVA real airplane that we could finally present.
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd what's the goal now?
p306
aVThe goal is to take off,
p307
aVend of this year for the first test,
p308
aVbut mainly next year, spring or summer,
p309
aVtake off, on our own power,
p310
aVwithout additional help, without being towed,
p311
aVclimb to 9,000 meters altitude.
p312
aVThe same time we load the batteries,
p313
aVwe run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height,
p314
aVwe arrive at the beginning of the night.
p315
aVAnd there, there will be just one goal, just one:
p316
aVreach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty.
p317
aV(Laughter)
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd this is exactly the symbol of our world.
p320
aVIf our airplane is too heavy,
p321
aVif the pilot wastes energy,
p322
aVwe'll never make it through the night.
p323
aVAnd in our world, if we keep on spoiling,
p324
aVwasting our energy resources,
p325
aVif we keep on building things that consume so much energy
p326
aVthat most of the companies now go bankrupt,
p327
aVit's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation
p328
aVwithout a major problem.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo, you see that this airplane is more a symbol.
p331
aVI don't think it will transport 200 people
p332
aVin the next years.
p333
aVBut when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,
p334
aVthe payload was also just sufficient
p335
aVfor one person and some fuel.
p336
aVAnd 20 years later there were 200 people
p337
aVin every airplane crossing the Atlantic.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo, we have to start,
p340
aVand show the example.
p341
aVA little bit like on this picture here.
p342
aVThis is a painting from Magritte,
p343
aVin the museum in Holland that I love so much.
p344
aVIt's a pipe, and it's written, "This is not a pipe."
p345
aVThis is not an airplane.
p346
aVThis is a symbol of what we can achieve
p347
aVwhen we believe in the impossible,
p348
aVwhen we have a team,
p349
aVwhen we have pioneering spirit,
p350
aVand especially when we understand
p351
aVthat all the certainties we have
p352
aVshould be thrown overboard.
p353
aa(lp354
VWhat pleases me very much
p355
aVis that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly
p356
aVaround the world with no fuel
p357
aVin order to have our message been understood.
p358
aVAnd more and more, we're invited around the world with Andre
p359
aVto talk about that project, to talk about the symbol of it,
p360
aVinvited by politicians, invited in energy forums,
p361
aVin order to show that it's not anymore
p362
aVcompletely stupid
p363
aVto think about getting rid of the dependency
p364
aVon fossil energies.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo, through speeches like this one today,
p367
aVthrough interviews, through meetings,
p368
aVour goal is to get as many people possible on the team.
p369
aVThe success will not come
p370
aVif we "just," quote, unquote,
p371
aVfly around the world in a solar-powered airplane.
p372
aVNo, the success will come
p373
aVif enough people are motivated
p374
aVto do exactly the same in their daily life,
p375
aVsave energy, go to renewables.
p376
aVAnd this is possible. You know, with the technologies we have today,
p377
aVwe can save between 30 and 50 percent
p378
aVof the energy of a country in Europe,
p379
aVand we can solve half of the rest with renewables.
p380
aVIt leaves 25 or 30 percent for
p381
aVoil, gas, coal, nuclear, or whatever.
p382
aVThis is acceptable.
p383
aa(lp384
VThis is why all the people who believe
p385
aVin this type of spirit
p386
aVare welcome to be on that team.
p387
aVYou can just go on SolarImpulse.com, subscribe
p388
aVto just be informed of what we're doing.
p389
aVBut much more, to get advices,
p390
aVto give your comments, to spread the word
p391
aVthat if it's possible in the air,
p392
aVof course it's possible in the ground.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd each time we have some ice in the future,
p395
aVwe have to know that life will be great,
p396
aVand the success will be brilliant
p397
aVif we dare to overcome our fear of the ice,
p398
aVto go through the obstacle,
p399
aVto go through the problem, in order to see what there is on the other side.
p400
aVSo, you see, this is what we're doing on our side.
p401
aVEveryone has his goal, has his dreams,
p402
aVhas his visions.
p403
aa(lp404
VThe question I leave you with now
p405
aVis which is the ballast
p406
aVyou would like to throw overboard?
p407
aVWhich will be the altitude at which
p408
aVyou would like to fly in your life,
p409
aVto get to the success that you wish to have,
p410
aVto get to the point that really belongs to you,
p411
aVwith the potential you have,
p412
aVand the one you can really fulfill?
p413
aVBecause the most renewable energy we have
p414
aVis our own potential, and our own passion.
p415
aVSo, let's go for it, and I wish you an excellent adventure
p416
aVin the wings of the future. Thank you.

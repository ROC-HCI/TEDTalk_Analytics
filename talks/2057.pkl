VWe're seen as the organization that is the bucket for failed social policy.
p5
aVI can't define who comes to us or how long they stay.
p6
aVWe get the people for whom nothing else has worked,
p7
aVpeople who have fallen through all
p8
aVof the other social safety nets.
p9
aVThey can't contain them, so we must.
p10
aVThat's our job:
p11
aVcontain them, control them.
p12
aa(lp13
VOver the years, as a prison system,
p14
aVas a nation, and as a society,
p15
aVwe've become very good at that,
p16
aVbut that shouldn't make you happy.
p17
aVToday we incarcerate more people per capita
p18
aVthan any other country in the world.
p19
aVWe have more black men in prison today
p20
aVthan were under slavery in 1850.
p21
aVWe house the parents of almost three million
p22
aVof our community's children,
p23
aVand we've become the new asylum,
p24
aVthe largest mental health provider in this nation.
p25
aVWhen we lock someone up,
p26
aVthat is no small thing.
p27
aVAnd yet, we are called the Department of Corrections.
p28
aVToday I want to talk about
p29
aVchanging the way we think about corrections.
p30
aVI believe, and my experience tells me,
p31
aVthat when we change the way we think,
p32
aVwe create new possibilities, or futures,
p33
aVand prisons need a different future.
p34
aa(lp35
VI've spent my entire career in corrections, over 30 years.
p36
aVI followed my dad into this field.
p37
aVHe was a Vietnam veteran. Corrections suited him.
p38
aVHe was strong, steady, disciplined.
p39
aVI was not so much any of those things,
p40
aVand I'm sure that worried him about me.
p41
aVEventually I decided, if I was going to end up in prison,
p42
aVI'd better end up on the right side of the bars,
p43
aVso I thought I'd check it out,
p44
aVtake a tour of the place my dad worked,
p45
aVthe McNeil Island Penitentiary.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow this was the early '80s,
p48
aVand prisons weren't quite what you see
p49
aVon TV or in the movies.
p50
aVIn many ways, it was worse.
p51
aVI walked into a cell house that was five tiers high.
p52
aVThere were eight men to a cell.
p53
aVthere were 550 men in that living unit.
p54
aVAnd just in case you wondered,
p55
aVthey shared one toilet in those small confines.
p56
aVAn officer put a key in a lockbox,
p57
aVand hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.
p58
aVHundreds of men streamed out of their cells.
p59
aVI walked away as fast as I could.
p60
aa(lp61
VEventually I went back and I started as an officer there.
p62
aVMy job was to run one of those cell blocks
p63
aVand to control those hundreds of men.
p64
aVWhen I went to work at our receptions center,
p65
aVI could actually hear the inmates  roiling from the parking lot,
p66
aVshaking cell doors, yelling,
p67
aVtearing up their cells.
p68
aVTake hundreds of volatile people and lock them up,
p69
aVand what you get is chaos.
p70
aVContain and control \u2014 that was our job.
p71
aa(lp72
VOne way we learned to do this more effectively
p73
aVwas a new type of housing unit
p74
aVcalled the Intensive Management Unit, IMU,
p75
aVa modern version of a "hole."
p76
aVWe put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors
p77
aVwith cuff ports so we could restrain them
p78
aVand feed them.
p79
aVGuess what?
p80
aVIt got quieter.
p81
aVDisturbances died down in the general population.
p82
aVPlaces became safer
p83
aVbecause those inmates who were most violent or disruptive
p84
aVcould now be isolated.
p85
aVBut isolation isn't good.
p86
aVDeprive people of social contact and they deteriorate.
p87
aVIt was hard getting them out of IMU,
p88
aVfor them and for us.
p89
aVEven in prison, it's no small thing
p90
aVto lock someone up.
p91
aa(lp92
VMy next assignment was to one of the state's deep-end prisons
p93
aVwhere some of our more violent or disruptive inmates are housed.
p94
aVBy then, the industry had advanced a lot,
p95
aVand we had different tools and techniques
p96
aVto manage disruptive behavior.
p97
aVWe had beanbag guns and pepper spray
p98
aVand plexiglass shields,
p99
aVflash bangs, emergency response teams.
p100
aVWe met violence with force
p101
aVand chaos with chaos.
p102
aVWe were pretty good at putting out fires.
p103
aa(lp104
VWhile I was there, I met two experienced correctional workers
p105
aVwho were also researchers,
p106
aVan anthropologist and a sociologist.
p107
aVOne day, one of them commented to me and said,
p108
aV"You know, you're pretty good at putting out fires.
p109
aVHave you ever thought about how to prevent them?"
p110
aVI was patient with them,
p111
aVexplaining our brute force approach
p112
aVto making prisons safer.
p113
aVThey were patient with me.
p114
aVOut of those conversations grew some new ideas
p115
aVand we started some small experiments.
p116
aVFirst, we started training our officers in teams
p117
aVrather than sending them one or two at a time to the state training academy.
p118
aVInstead of four weeks of training, we gave them 10.
p119
aVThen we experimented with an apprenticeship model
p120
aVwhere we paired new staff with veteran staff.
p121
aVThey both got better at the work.
p122
aVSecond, we added verbal de-escalation skills
p123
aVinto the training continuum
p124
aVand made it part of the use of force continuum.
p125
aVIt was the non-force use of force.
p126
aVAnd then we did something even more radical.
p127
aVWe trained the inmates on those same skills.
p128
aVWe changed the skill set,
p129
aVreducing violence, not just responding to it.
p130
aa(lp131
VThird, when we expanded our facility,  we tried a new type of design.
p132
aVNow the biggest and most controversial component
p133
aVof this design, of course, was the toilet.
p134
aVThere were no toilets.
p135
aVNow that might not sound significant to you here today,
p136
aVbut at the time, it was huge.
p137
aVNo one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet.
p138
aVWe all thought it was dangerous and crazy.
p139
aVEven eight men to a cell had a toilet.
p140
aVThat small detail changed the way we worked.
p141
aVInmates and staff started interacting
p142
aVmore often and openly and developing a rapport.
p143
aVIt was easier to detect conflict and intervene
p144
aVbefore it escalated.
p145
aVThe unit was cleaner, quieter, safer and more humane.
p146
aVThis was more effective at keeping the peace
p147
aVthan any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point.
p148
aVInteracting changes the way you behave,
p149
aVboth for the officer and the inmate.
p150
aVWe changed the environment and we changed the behavior.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, just in case I hadn't learned this lesson,
p153
aVthey assigned me to headquarters next,
p154
aVand that's where I ran straight up against system change.
p155
aVNow, many things work against system change:
p156
aVpolitics and politicians, bills and laws,
p157
aVcourts and lawsuits, internal politics.
p158
aVSystem change is difficult and slow,
p159
aVand oftentimes it doesn't take you
p160
aVwhere you want to go.
p161
aVIt's no small thing to change a prison system.
p162
aVSo what I did do is I reflected on my earlier experiences
p163
aVand I remembered that when we interacted with offenders, the heat went down.
p164
aVWhen we changed the environment, the behavior changed.
p165
aVAnd these were not huge system changes.
p166
aVThese were small changes, and these changes
p167
aVcreated new possibilities.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo next, I got reassigned as superintendent of a small prison.
p170
aVAnd at the same time, I was working on my degree
p171
aVat the Evergreen State College.
p172
aVI interacted with a lot of people who were not like me,
p173
aVpeople who had different ideas
p174
aVand came from different backgrounds.
p175
aVOne of them was a rainforest ecologist.
p176
aVShe looked at my small prison and what she saw
p177
aVwas a laboratory.
p178
aVWe talked and discovered how prisons and inmates
p179
aVcould actually help advance science
p180
aVby helping them complete projects
p181
aVthey couldn't complete on their own,
p182
aVlike repopulating endangered species:
p183
aVfrogs, butterflies, endangered prairie plants.
p184
aVAt the same time, we found ways to make
p185
aVour operation more efficient
p186
aVthrough the addition of solar power,
p187
aVrainwater catchment, organic gardening, recycling.
p188
aVThis initiative has led to many projects
p189
aVthat have had huge system-wide impact,
p190
aVnot just in our system, but in  other state systems as well,
p191
aVsmall experiments making a big difference
p192
aVto science, to the community.
p193
aVThe way we think about our work changes our work.
p194
aVThe project just made my job more interesting and exciting.
p195
aVI was excited. Staff were excited.
p196
aVOfficers were excited. Inmates were excited.
p197
aVThey were inspired.
p198
aVEverybody wanted to be part of this.
p199
aVThey were making a contribution, a difference,
p200
aVone they thought was meaningful and important.
p201
aa(lp202
VLet me be clear on what's going on here, though.
p203
aVInmates are highly adaptive.
p204
aVThey have to be.
p205
aVOftentimes, they know more about our own systems
p206
aVthan the people who run them.
p207
aVAnd they're here for a reason.
p208
aVI don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them,
p209
aVbut I do think they can have
p210
aVdecent and meaningful lives even in prison.
p211
aVSo that was the question:
p212
aVCould inmates live decent and meaningful lives,
p213
aVand if so, what difference would that make?
p214
aVSo I took that question back to the deep end,
p215
aVwhere some of our most violent offenders are housed.
p216
aVRemember, IMUs are for punishment.
p217
aVYou don't get perks there, like programming.
p218
aVThat was how we thought.
p219
aVBut then we started to realize that if any inmates
p220
aVneeded programming, it was these particular inmates.
p221
aVIn fact, they needed intensive programming.
p222
aVSo we changed our thinking 180 degrees,
p223
aVand we started looking for new possibilities.
p224
aVWhat we found was a new kind of chair.
p225
aVInstead of using the chair for punishment,
p226
aVwe put it in classrooms.
p227
aVOkay, we didn't forget our responsibility to control,
p228
aVbut now inmates could interact safely, face-to-face
p229
aVwith other inmates and staff,
p230
aVand because control was no longer an issue,
p231
aVeverybody could focus on other things,
p232
aVlike learning. Behavior changed.
p233
aVWe changed our thinking, and we changed  what was possible, and this gives me hope.
p234
aa(lp235
VNow, I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work.
p236
aVWhat I can tell you, though, it is working.
p237
aVOur prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates,
p238
aVand when our prisons are safe,
p239
aVwe can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling.
p240
aVReducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal,
p241
aVbut it's not our only goal.
p242
aVTo be honest with you, preventing crime
p243
aVtakes so much more from so many more people
p244
aVand institutions.
p245
aVIf we rely on just prisons to reduce crime,
p246
aVI'm afraid we'll never get there.
p247
aVBut prisons can do some things
p248
aVwe never thought they could do.
p249
aVPrisons can be the source of innovation
p250
aVand sustainability,
p251
aVrepopulating endangered species and environmental restoration.
p252
aVInmates can be scientists and beekeepers,
p253
aVdog rescuers.
p254
aVPrisons can be the source of meaningful work
p255
aVand opportunity for staff
p256
aVand the inmates who live there.
p257
aVWe can contain and control
p258
aVand provide humane environments.
p259
aVThese are not opposing qualities.
p260
aa(lp261
VWe can't wait 10 to 20 years to find out
p262
aVif this is worth doing.
p263
aVOur strategy is not massive system change.
p264
aVOur strategy is hundreds of small changes
p265
aVthat take place in days or months, not years.
p266
aVWe need more small pilots where we learn as we go,
p267
aVpilots that change the range of possibility.
p268
aVWe need new and better ways to measure impacts
p269
aVon engagement, on interaction,
p270
aVon safe environments.
p271
aVWe need more opportunities to participate in
p272
aVand contribute to our communities,
p273
aVyour communities.
p274
aVPrisons need to be secure, yes, safe, yes.
p275
aVWe can do that.
p276
aVPrisons need to provide humane environments
p277
aVwhere people can participate, contribute,
p278
aVand learn meaningful lives.
p279
aVWe're learning how to do that.
p280
aa(lp281
VThat's why I'm hopeful.
p282
aVWe don't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison.
p283
aVWe can define that. We can create that.
p284
aVAnd when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity,
p285
aVprisons can be more than the bucket
p286
aVfor failed social policy.
p287
aVMaybe finally, we will earn our title:
p288
aVa department of corrections.
p289
aa(lp290
VThank you.

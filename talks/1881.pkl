VI'm here today to talk about social change,
p5
aVnot a new therapy or a new intervention
p6
aVor a new way of working with kids or something like that,
p7
aVbut a new business model for social change,
p8
aVa new way of tackling the problem.
p9
aa(lp10
VIn Britain, 63 percent of all men
p11
aVwho come out of short sentences from prison
p12
aVre-offend again within a year.
p13
aVNow how many previous offenses
p14
aVdo you think they have on average
p15
aVmanaged to commit?
p16
aVForty-three.
p17
aVAnd how many previous times do you think they've been in prison?
p18
aVSeven.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,
p21
aVand we said to the Ministry of Justice,
p22
aVwhat's it worth to you
p23
aVif fewer of these guys re-offend?
p24
aVIt's got to be worth something, right?
p25
aVI mean, there's prison costs,
p26
aVthere's police costs, there's court costs,
p27
aVall these things that you're spending money on
p28
aVto deal with these guys. What's it worth?
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, of course, we care about the social value.
p31
aVSocial Finance, the organization I helped set up,
p32
aVcares about social stuff.
p33
aVBut we wanted to make the economic case,
p34
aVbecause if we could make the economic case,
p35
aVthen the value of doing this  would be completely compelling.
p36
aVAnd if we can agree on both a value
p37
aVand a way of measuring whether we've been
p38
aVsuccessful at reducing that re-offending,
p39
aVthen we can do something
p40
aVwe think rather interesting.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe idea is called the social impact bond.
p43
aVNow, the social impact bond is simply saying,
p44
aVif we can get the government to agree,
p45
aVthat we can create a contract where
p46
aVthey only pay if it worked.
p47
aVSo that means that they can try out new stuff
p48
aVwithout the embarrassment
p49
aVof having to pay if it didn't work,
p50
aVwhich for still quite a lot of bits of government,
p51
aVthat's a serious issue.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, many of you may have noticed
p54
aVthere's a problem at this point,
p55
aVand that is that it takes a long time to measure
p56
aVwhether those outcomes have happened.
p57
aVSo we have to raise some money.
p58
aVWe use the contract to raise money
p59
aVfrom socially motivated investors.
p60
aVSocially motivated investors:
p61
aVthere's an interesting idea, right?
p62
aVBut actually, there's a lot of people who,
p63
aVif they're given the chance,
p64
aVwould love to invest in something
p65
aVthat does social good.
p66
aVAnd here's the opportunity.
p67
aVDo you want to also help government find
p68
aVwhether there's a better economic model,
p69
aVnot just leaving these guys to come out of prison
p70
aVand waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again,
p71
aVbut actually working with them
p72
aVto move to a different path
p73
aVto end up with fewer crimes
p74
aVand fewer victims?
p75
aa(lp76
VSo we find some investors,
p77
aVand they pay for a set of services,
p78
aVand if those services are successful,
p79
aVthen they improve outcomes,
p80
aVand with those measured reductions in re-offending,
p81
aVgovernment saves money,
p82
aVand with those savings,
p83
aVthey can pay outcomes.
p84
aVAnd the investors do not just get their money back,
p85
aVbut they make a return.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo in March 2010, we signed
p88
aVthe first social impact bond
p89
aVwith the Ministry of Justice
p90
aVaround Peterborough Prison.
p91
aVIt was to work with 3,000 offenders
p92
aVsplit into three cohorts of 1,000 each.
p93
aVNow, each of those cohorts
p94
aVwould get measured over the two years
p95
aVthat they were coming out of prison.
p96
aVThey've got to have a year to commit their crimes,
p97
aVsix months to get through the court system,
p98
aVand then they would be compared to a group
p99
aVtaken from the police national computer,
p100
aVas similar as possible,
p101
aVand we would get paid
p102
aVproviding we achieved a hurdle rate of 10-percent reduction,
p103
aVfor every conviction event that didn't happen.
p104
aVSo we get paid for crimes saved.
p105
aVNow if we achieved that 10-percent reduction
p106
aVacross all three cohorts,
p107
aVthen the investors get a seven and a half percent
p108
aVannualized return on their investment,
p109
aVand if we do better than that,
p110
aVthey can get up to 13 percent
p111
aVannualized return on their investment,
p112
aVwhich is okay.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo everyone wins here, right?
p115
aVThe Ministry of Justice can try out a new program
p116
aVand they only pay if it works.
p117
aVInvestors get two opportunities:
p118
aVfor the first time, they can invest in social change.
p119
aVAlso, they make a reasonable return,
p120
aVand they also know that
p121
aVfirst investors in these kinds of things,
p122
aVthey're going to have to believers.
p123
aVThey're going to have to care in the social program,
p124
aVbut if this builds a track record
p125
aVover five or 10 years,
p126
aVthen you can widen that investor community
p127
aVas more people have confidence in the product.
p128
aVThe service providers, well, for the first time,
p129
aVthey've got an opportunity to provide services
p130
aVand grow the evidence for what they're doing
p131
aVin a really constructive way and learn
p132
aVand demonstrate the value of what they're doing
p133
aVover five or six years, not just one or two
p134
aVas often happens at the moment.
p135
aVSociety wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims.
p136
aVNow, the offenders, they also benefit.
p137
aVInstead of just coming out of the prison
p138
aVwith 46 pounds in their pocket,
p139
aVhalf of them not knowing where they're spending
p140
aVtheir first night out of jail,
p141
aVactually, someone meets them in prison,
p142
aVlearns about their issues,
p143
aVmeets them at the gate,
p144
aVtakes them through to somewhere to stay,
p145
aVconnects them to benefits, connects them to employment,
p146
aVdrug rehabilitation, mental health,
p147
aVwhatever's needed.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo let's think of another example:
p150
aVworking with children in care.
p151
aVSocial impact bonds work great
p152
aVfor any area where there is at the moment
p153
aVvery expensive provision that produces
p154
aVpoor outcomes for people.
p155
aVSo children in the state care
p156
aVtend to do very badly.
p157
aVOnly 13 percent achieve a reasonable level
p158
aVof five GCSEs at 16,
p159
aVagainst 58 percent of the wider population.
p160
aVMore troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison
p161
aVhave spent some time in care.
p162
aVAnd even more worryingly,
p163
aVand this is a Home Office statistic,
p164
aV70 percent of prostitutes
p165
aVhave spent some time in care.
p166
aVThe state is not a great parent.
p167
aVBut there are great programs
p168
aVfor adolescents who are on the edge of care,
p169
aVand 30 percent of kids going into care
p170
aVare adolescents.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo we set up a program with Essex County Council
p173
aVto test out intensive family therapeutic support
p174
aVfor those families with adolescents
p175
aVon the edge of the care system.
p176
aVEssex only pays in the event
p177
aVthat it's saving them care costs.
p178
aVInvestors have put in 3.1 million pounds.
p179
aVThat program started last month.
p180
aVOthers, around homelessness in London,
p181
aVaround youth and employment and education
p182
aVelsewhere in the country.
p183
aVThere are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,
p184
aVand amazing levels of interest in this idea
p185
aVall over the world.
p186
aVSo David Cameron's put 20 million pounds
p187
aVinto a social outcomes fund to support this idea.
p188
aVObama has suggested 300 million dollars
p189
aVin the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas
p190
aVand structures to move it forward,
p191
aVand a lot of other countries
p192
aVare demonstrating considerable interest.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo what's caused this excitement?
p195
aVWhy is this so different for people?
p196
aVWell, the first piece, which we've talked about,
p197
aVis innovation.
p198
aVIt enables testing of new ideas
p199
aVin a way that's less difficult for everybody.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe second piece it brings is rigor.
p202
aVBy working to outcomes, people really have to test
p203
aVand bring data into the situation that one's dealing with.
p204
aVSo taking Peterborough as an example,
p205
aVwe add case management
p206
aVacross all of the different organizations that we're working with
p207
aVso they know
p208
aVwhat actually has been done with different prisoners,
p209
aVand at the same time they learn
p210
aVfrom the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,
p211
aVbecause we pushed for the data,
p212
aVwhat actually happens, whether they get re-arrested or not.
p213
aVAnd we learn and adapt the program accordingly.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd this leads to the third element, which is new,
p216
aVand that's flexibility.
p217
aVBecause normal contracting for things,
p218
aVwhen you're spending government money,
p219
aVyou're spending our money, tax money,
p220
aVand the people who are in charge  of that are very aware of it
p221
aVso the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it.
p222
aVNow any entrepreneur in the room knows
p223
aVthat version 1.0, the business plan,
p224
aVis not the one that generally works.
p225
aVSo when you're trying to do something like this,
p226
aVyou need the flexibility to adapt the program.
p227
aVAnd again, in Peterborough, we started off
p228
aVwith a program, but we also collected data,
p229
aVand over the period of time,
p230
aVwe nuanced and changed that program
p231
aVto add a range of other elements,
p232
aVso that the service adapts
p233
aVand we meet the needs of the long term
p234
aVas well as the short term:
p235
aVgreater engagement from the prisoners,
p236
aVlonger-term engagement as well.
p237
aa(lp238
VThe last element is partnership.
p239
aVThere is, at the moment, a stale  debate going on very often:
p240
aVstate's better, public sector's better,
p241
aVprivate sector's better, social sector's better,
p242
aVfor a lot of these programs.
p243
aVActually, for creating social change,
p244
aVwe need to bring in the expertise
p245
aVfrom all of those parties
p246
aVin order to make this work.
p247
aVAnd this creates a structure
p248
aVthrough which they can combine.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo where does this leave us?
p251
aVThis leaves us with a way
p252
aVthat people can invest in social change.
p253
aVWe've met thousands, possibly millions of people,
p254
aVwho want the opportunity to invest in social change.
p255
aVWe've met champions all over the public sector
p256
aVkeen to make these kinds of differences.
p257
aVWith this kind of model,
p258
aVwe can help bring them together.
p259
aa(lp260
VThank you.

And they end up re-offending and back in jail. It&#39;s an expensive problem to fix, but it&#39;s a much more expensive one to ignore. A director at Social Finance in London, Toby Eccles explores the arbitrage between those two options.</p>   <p>In 2010, his pioneering Social Impact Bond allowed private investors to support a UK program targeting ex-prisoners who served short sentences (the limited government funding only goes to ex-inmates who served long terms). The &pound;5m scheme, funded by 17 investors, supports training and support for 1,000 ex-inmates; if they re-offend less than a control group, the government will pay investors back, plus interest, through the savings accrued by achieving the program&#39;s targets.</p>  <p>More such bonds are now being tried across the world, including in New York City and Massachusetts (both addressing recidivism), and extended to new fields such as development. Eccles founded Social Finance in 2007, and he oversees all of the firm&#39;s social impact bond work, where, he says: &quot;We are incentivised to work with the complicated and with those willing to change.&quot; &quot;We are incentivised to work with the complicated and with those willing to change.&quot;</p>", "slug": "toby_eccles", "whotheyare": "Toby Eccles has created a radical financial instrument that helps private investors contribute to solving thorny public problems.", "whatotherssay": "Imagine a world where the might of private capital could be harnessed to address society\'s most intractable problems.

out of prison with the exact same problems he or she walked in with: lack of skills, lack of support, no job. And they end up re-offending and back in jail. It&#39;s an expensive problem to fix, but it&#39;s a much more expensive one to ignore. A director at Social Finance in London, Toby Eccles explores the arbitrage between those two options.</p>   <p>In 2010, his pioneering Social Impact Bond allowed private investors to support a UK program targeting ex-prisoners who served short sentences (the limited government funding only goes to ex-inmates who served long terms). The &pound;5m scheme, funded by 17 investors, supports training and support for 1,000 ex-inmates; if they re-offend less than a control group, the government will pay investors back, plus interest, through the savings accrued by achieving the program&#39;s targets.</p>  <p>More such bonds are now being tried across the world, including in New York City and Massachusetts (both addressing recidivism), and extended to new fields such as development. Eccles founded Social Finance in 2007, and he oversees all of the firm&#39;s social impact bond work, where, he says: &quot;We are incentivised to work with the complicated and with those willing to change.&quot; &quot;We are incentivised to work with the complicated and with those willing to change.&quot;</p>", "slug": "toby_eccles", "whotheyare": "Toby Eccles has created a radical financial instrument that helps private investors contribute to solving thorny public problems.", "whatotherssay": "Imagine a world where the might of private capital could be harnessed to address society\'s most intractable problems.

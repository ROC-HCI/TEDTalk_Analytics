VOne thing the world needs,
p5
aVone thing this country desperately needs
p6
aVis a better way
p7
aVof conducting our political debates.
p8
aVWe need to rediscover
p9
aVthe lost art of democratic argument.
p10
aV(Applause)
p11
aVIf you think about the arguments we have,
p12
aVmost of the time it's shouting matches
p13
aVon cable television,
p14
aVideological food fights on the floor of Congress.
p15
aVI have a suggestion.
p16
aVLook at all the arguments we have these days
p17
aVover health care,
p18
aVover bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street,
p19
aVover the gap between rich and poor,
p20
aVover affirmative action and same-sex marriage.
p21
aVLying just beneath the surface
p22
aVof those arguments,
p23
aVwith passions raging on all sides,
p24
aVare big questions
p25
aVof moral philosophy,
p26
aVbig questions of justice.
p27
aVBut we too rarely
p28
aVarticulate and defend
p29
aVand argue about
p30
aVthose big moral questions in our politics.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo what I would like to do today
p33
aVis have something of a discussion.
p34
aVFirst, let me take
p35
aVa famous philosopher
p36
aVwho wrote about those questions
p37
aVof justice and morality,
p38
aVgive you a very short lecture
p39
aVon Aristotle of ancient Athens,
p40
aVAristotle's theory of justice,
p41
aVand then have a discussion here
p42
aVto see whether Aristotle's ideas
p43
aVactually inform
p44
aVthe way we think and argue
p45
aVabout questions today.
p46
aVSo, are you ready for the lecture?
p47
aVAccording to Aristotle,
p48
aVjustice means giving people what they deserve.
p49
aVThat's it; that's the lecture.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, you may say, well, that's obvious enough.
p54
aVThe real questions begin
p55
aVwhen it comes to arguing about
p56
aVwho deserves what and why.
p57
aVTake the example of flutes.
p58
aVSuppose we're distributing flutes.
p59
aVWho should get the best ones?
p60
aVLet's see what people \u2014
p61
aVWhat would you say?
p62
aVWho should get the best flute?
p63
aVYou can just call it out.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Audience: Random.)
p66
aa(lp67
VMichael Sandel: At random. You would do it by lottery.
p68
aVOr by the first person to rush into the hall to get them.
p69
aVWho else?
p70
aa(lp71
V(Audience: The best flute players.)
p72
aa(lp73
VMS: The best flute players. (Audience: The worst flute players.)
p74
aa(lp75
VMS: The worst flute players.
p76
aVHow many say the best flute players?
p77
aVWhy?
p78
aVActually, that was Aristotle's answer too.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VBut here's a harder question.
p83
aVWhy do you think,
p84
aVthose of you who voted this way,
p85
aVthat the best flutes should go to the best flute players?
p86
aa(lp87
VPeter: The greatest benefit to all.
p88
aa(lp89
VMS: The greatest benefit to all.
p90
aVWe'll hear better music
p91
aVif the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
p92
aVThat's Peter? (Audience: Peter.)
p93
aa(lp94
VMS: All right.
p95
aVWell, it's a good reason.
p96
aVWe'll all be better off if good music is played
p97
aVrather than terrible music.
p98
aVBut Peter,
p99
aVAristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason.
p100
aVThat's all right.
p101
aVAristotle had a different reason
p102
aVfor saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
p103
aVHe said,
p104
aVthat's what flutes are for \u2014
p105
aVto be played well.
p106
aVHe says that to reason about
p107
aVjust distribution of a thing,
p108
aVwe have to reason about,
p109
aVand sometimes argue about,
p110
aVthe purpose of the thing,
p111
aVor the social activity \u2014
p112
aVin this case, musical performance.
p113
aVAnd the point, the essential nature,
p114
aVof musical performance
p115
aVis to produce excellent music.
p116
aVIt'll be a happy byproduct
p117
aVthat we'll all benefit.
p118
aVBut when we think about justice,
p119
aVAristotle says,
p120
aVwhat we really need to think about
p121
aVis the essential nature of the activity in question
p122
aVand the qualities that are worth
p123
aVhonoring and admiring and recognizing.
p124
aVOne of the reasons
p125
aVthat the best flute players should get the best flutes
p126
aVis that musical performance
p127
aVis not only to make the rest of us happy,
p128
aVbut to honor
p129
aVand recognize
p130
aVthe excellence
p131
aVof the best musicians.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes
p134
aVmay seem a trivial case.
p135
aVLet's take a contemporary example
p136
aVof the dispute about justice.
p137
aVIt had to do with golf.
p138
aVCasey Martin \u2014 a few years ago,
p139
aVCasey Martin \u2014
p140
aVdid any of you hear about him?
p141
aVHe was a very good golfer,
p142
aVbut he had a disability.
p143
aVHe had a bad leg, a circulatory problem,
p144
aVthat made it very painful
p145
aVfor him to walk the course.
p146
aVIn fact, it carried risk of injury.
p147
aVHe asked the PGA,
p148
aVthe Professional Golfers' Association,
p149
aVfor permission to use a golf cart
p150
aVin the PGA tournaments.
p151
aVThey said, "No.
p152
aVNow that would give you an unfair advantage."
p153
aVHe sued,
p154
aVand his case went all the way
p155
aVto the Supreme Court, believe it or not,
p156
aVthe case over the golf cart,
p157
aVbecause the law says
p158
aVthat the disabled
p159
aVmust be accommodated,
p160
aVprovided the accommodation does not
p161
aVchange the essential nature
p162
aVof the activity.
p163
aVHe says, "I'm a great golfer.
p164
aVI want to compete.
p165
aVBut I need a golf cart
p166
aVto get from one hole to the next."
p167
aa(lp168
VSuppose you were
p169
aVon the Supreme Court.
p170
aVSuppose you were deciding
p171
aVthe justice of this case.
p172
aVHow many here would say
p173
aVthat Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart?
p174
aVAnd how many say, no, he doesn't?
p175
aVAll right, let's take a poll, show of hands.
p176
aVHow many would rule in favor of Casey Martin?
p177
aVAnd how many would not? How many would say he doesn't?
p178
aVAll right, we have a good division of opinion here.
p179
aVSomeone who would not
p180
aVgrant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart,
p181
aVwhat would be your reason?
p182
aVRaise your hand, and we'll try to get you a microphone.
p183
aVWhat would be your reason?
p184
aa(lp185
V(Audience: It'd be an unfair advantage.)
p186
aa(lp187
VMS: It would be an unfair advantage
p188
aVif he gets to ride in a golf cart.
p189
aVAll right, those of you,
p190
aVI imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart
p191
aVworry about an unfair advantage.
p192
aVWhat about those of you who say
p193
aVhe should be given a golf cart?
p194
aVHow would you answer the objection?
p195
aVYes, all right.
p196
aa(lp197
VAudience: The cart's not part of the game.
p198
aa(lp199
VMS: What's your name? (Audience: Charlie.)
p200
aa(lp201
VMS: Charlie says \u2014
p202
aVWe'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply.
p203
aVTell us, Charlie,
p204
aVwhy would you say he should be able to use a golf cart?
p205
aa(lp206
VCharlie: The cart's not part of the game.
p207
aa(lp208
VMS: But what about walking from hole to hole?
p209
aa(lp210
VCharlie: It doesn't matter; it's not part of the game.
p211
aa(lp212
VMS: Walking the course is not part of the game of golf?
p213
aa(lp214
VCharlie: Not in my book, it isn't.
p215
aa(lp216
VMS: All right. Stay there, Charlie.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VWho has an answer for Charlie?
p221
aVAll right, who has an answer for Charlie?
p222
aVWhat would you say?
p223
aa(lp224
VAudience: The endurance element is a very important part of the game,
p225
aVwalking all those holes.
p226
aa(lp227
VMS: Walking all those holes?
p228
aVThat's part of the game of golf? (Audience: Absolutely.)
p229
aa(lp230
VMS: What's your name? (Audience: Warren.)
p231
aa(lp232
VMS: Warren.
p233
aVCharlie, what do you say to Warren?
p234
aa(lp235
VCharley: I'll stick to my original thesis.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VMS: Warren, are you a golfer?
p240
aa(lp241
VWarren: I am not a golfer.
p242
aa(lp243
VCharley: And I am. (MS: Okay.)
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
V(Applause)
p247
aa(lp248
VYou know,
p249
aVit's interesting.
p250
aVIn the case, in the lower court,
p251
aVthey brought in golfing greats
p252
aVto testify on this very issue.
p253
aVIs walking the course essential to the game?
p254
aVAnd they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.
p255
aVAnd what do you suppose they all said?
p256
aVYes. They agreed with Warren.
p257
aVThey said, yes, walking the course
p258
aVis strenuous physical exercise.
p259
aVThe fatigue factor is an important part of golf.
p260
aVAnd so it would change
p261
aVthe fundamental nature of the game
p262
aVto give him the golf cart.
p263
aVNow, notice,
p264
aVsomething interesting \u2014
p265
aVWell, I should tell you about the Supreme Court first.
p266
aa(lp267
VThe Supreme Court
p268
aVdecided.
p269
aVWhat do you suppose they said?
p270
aVThey said yes,
p271
aVthat Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart.
p272
aVSeven to two, they ruled.
p273
aVWhat was interesting about their ruling
p274
aVand about the discussion we've just had
p275
aVis that the discussion about
p276
aVthe right, the justice, of the matter
p277
aVdepended on
p278
aVfiguring out what is
p279
aVthe essential nature of golf.
p280
aVAnd the Supreme Court justices
p281
aVwrestled with that question.
p282
aVAnd Justice Stevens, writing for the majority,
p283
aVsaid he had read all about the history of golf,
p284
aVand the essential point of the game
p285
aVis to get very small ball from one place
p286
aVinto a hole
p287
aVin as few strokes as possible,
p288
aVand that walking was not essential, but incidental.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow, there were two dissenters,
p291
aVone of whom was Justice Scalia.
p292
aVHe wouldn't have granted the cart,
p293
aVand he had a very interesting dissent.
p294
aVIt's interesting because
p295
aVhe rejected the Aristotelian premise
p296
aVunderlying the majority's opinion.
p297
aVHe said it's not possible
p298
aVto determine the essential nature
p299
aVof a game like golf.
p300
aVHere's how he put it.
p301
aV"To say that something is essential
p302
aVis ordinarily to say that it is necessary
p303
aVto the achievement of a certain object.
p304
aVBut since it is the very nature of a game
p305
aVto have no object except amusement,
p306
aV(Laughter)
p307
aVthat is, what distinguishes games
p308
aVfrom productive activity,
p309
aV(Laughter)
p310
aVit is quite impossible to say
p311
aVthat any of a game's arbitrary rules
p312
aVis essential."
p313
aa(lp314
VSo there you have Justice Scalia
p315
aVtaking on the Aristotelian premise
p316
aVof the majority's opinion.
p317
aVJustice Scalia's opinion
p318
aVis questionable
p319
aVfor two reasons.
p320
aVFirst, no real sports fan would talk that way.
p321
aV(Laughter)
p322
aVIf we had thought that the rules
p323
aVof the sports we care about
p324
aVare merely arbitrary,
p325
aVrather than designed to call forth
p326
aVthe virtues and the excellences
p327
aVthat we think are worthy of admiring,
p328
aVwe wouldn't care about the outcome of the game.
p329
aVIt's also objectionable
p330
aVon a second ground.
p331
aVOn the face of it,
p332
aVit seemed to be \u2014 this debate about the golf cart \u2014
p333
aVan argument about fairness,
p334
aVwhat's an unfair advantage.
p335
aVBut if fairness were the only thing at stake,
p336
aVthere would have been an easy and obvious solution.
p337
aVWhat would it be? (Audience: Let everyone use the cart.)
p338
aVLet everyone ride in a golf cart
p339
aVif they want to.
p340
aVThen the fairness objection goes away.
p341
aa(lp342
VBut letting everyone ride in a cart
p343
aVwould have been, I suspect,
p344
aVmore anathema
p345
aVto the golfing greats
p346
aVand to the PGA,
p347
aVeven than making an exception for Casey Martin.
p348
aVWhy?
p349
aVBecause what was at stake
p350
aVin the dispute over the golf cart
p351
aVwas not only the essential nature of golf,
p352
aVbut, relatedly, the question:
p353
aVWhat abilities
p354
aVare worthy
p355
aVof honor and recognition
p356
aVas athletic talents?
p357
aVLet me put the point
p358
aVas delicately as possible:
p359
aVGolfers are a little sensitive
p360
aVabout the athletic status of their game.
p361
aV(Laughter)
p362
aVAfter all, there's no running or jumping,
p363
aVand the ball stands still.
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aVSo if golfing is the kind of game
p366
aVthat can be played while riding around in a golf cart,
p367
aVit would be hard to confer
p368
aVon the golfing greats
p369
aVthe status that we confer,
p370
aVthe honor and recognition
p371
aVthat goes to truly great athletes.
p372
aVThat illustrates
p373
aVthat with golf,
p374
aVas with flutes,
p375
aVit's hard to decide the question
p376
aVof what justice requires,
p377
aVwithout grappling with the question,
p378
aV"What is the essential nature
p379
aVof the activity in question,
p380
aVand what qualities,
p381
aVwhat excellences
p382
aVconnected with that activity,
p383
aVare worthy of honor and recognition?"
p384
aa(lp385
VLet's take a final example
p386
aVthat's prominent in contemporary political debate:
p387
aVsame-sex marriage.
p388
aVThere are those who favor state recognition
p389
aVonly of traditional marriage
p390
aVbetween one man and one woman,
p391
aVand there are those who favor state recognition
p392
aVof same-sex marriage.
p393
aVHow many here
p394
aVfavor the first policy:
p395
aVthe state should recognize traditional marriage only?
p396
aVAnd how many favor the second, same-sex marriage?
p397
aVNow, put it this way:
p398
aVWhat ways of thinking
p399
aVabout justice and morality
p400
aVunderlie the arguments we have
p401
aVover marriage?
p402
aVThe opponents of same-sex marriage say
p403
aVthat the purpose of marriage,
p404
aVfundamentally, is procreation,
p405
aVand that's what's worthy of honoring
p406
aVand recognizing and encouraging.
p407
aVAnd the defenders of same-sex marriage say no,
p408
aVprocreation is not the only purpose of marriage;
p409
aVwhat about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment?
p410
aVThat's really what marriage is about.
p411
aVSo with flutes, with golf carts,
p412
aVand even with a fiercely contested question
p413
aVlike same-sex marriage,
p414
aVAristotle has a point.
p415
aVVery hard to argue about justice
p416
aVwithout first arguing
p417
aVabout the purpose of social institutions
p418
aVand about what qualities are worthy
p419
aVof honor and recognition.
p420
aa(lp421
VSo let's step back from these cases
p422
aVand see how they shed light
p423
aVon the way we might improve, elevate,
p424
aVthe terms of political discourse
p425
aVin the United States,
p426
aVand for that matter, around the world.
p427
aVThere is a tendency to think
p428
aVthat if we engage too directly
p429
aVwith moral questions in politics,
p430
aVthat's a recipe for disagreement,
p431
aVand for that matter, a recipe for
p432
aVintolerance and coercion.
p433
aVSo better to shy away from,
p434
aVto ignore,
p435
aVthe moral and the religious convictions
p436
aVthat people bring to civic life.
p437
aVIt seems to me that our discussion
p438
aVreflects the opposite,
p439
aVthat a better way
p440
aVto mutual respect
p441
aVis to engage directly
p442
aVwith the moral convictions
p443
aVcitizens bring to public life,
p444
aVrather than to require
p445
aVthat people leave their deepest moral convictions
p446
aVoutside politics
p447
aVbefore they enter.
p448
aVThat, it seems to me, is a way
p449
aVto begin to restore
p450
aVthe art of democratic argument.
p451
aa(lp452
VThank you very much.
p453
aa(lp454
V(Applause)
p455
aa(lp456
VThank you.
p457
aa(lp458
V(Applause)
p459
aa(lp460
VThank you.
p461
aa(lp462
V(Applause)
p463
aa(lp464
VThank you very much.
p465
aVThanks. Thank you.
p466
aVChris.
p467
aVThanks, Chris.
p468
aa(lp469
VChris Anderson: From flutes to golf courses
p470
aVto same-sex marriage \u2014
p471
aVthat was a genius link.
p472
aVNow look, you're a pioneer of open education.
p473
aVYour lecture series was one of the first to do it big.
p474
aVWhat's your vision for the next phase of this?
p475
aa(lp476
VMS: Well, I think that it is possible.
p477
aVIn the classroom, we have arguments
p478
aVon some of the most fiercely held
p479
aVmoral convictions that students have
p480
aVabout big public questions.
p481
aVAnd I think we can do that in public life more generally.
p482
aVAnd so my real dream would be
p483
aVto take the public television series
p484
aVthat we've created of the course \u2014
p485
aVit's available now, online,
p486
aVfree for everyone anywhere in the world \u2014
p487
aVand to see whether we can partner with institutions,
p488
aVat universities in China, in India,
p489
aVin Africa, around the world,
p490
aVto try to promote
p491
aVcivic education
p492
aVand also a richer kind
p493
aVof democratic debate.
p494
aa(lp495
VCA: So you picture, at some point,
p496
aVlive, in real time,
p497
aVyou could have this kind of conversation, inviting questions,
p498
aVbut with people from China and India joining in?
p499
aa(lp500
VMS: Right. We did a little bit of it here
p501
aVwith 1,500 people in Long Beach,
p502
aVand we do it in a classroom at Harvard
p503
aVwith about 1,000 students.
p504
aVWouldn't it be interesting
p505
aVto take this way
p506
aVof thinking and arguing,
p507
aVengaging seriously with big moral questions,
p508
aVexploring cultural differences
p509
aVand connect through a live video hookup,
p510
aVstudents in Beijing and Mumbai
p511
aVand in Cambridge, Massachusetts
p512
aVand create a global classroom.
p513
aVThat's what I would love to do.
p514
aa(lp515
V(Applause)
p516
aa(lp517
VCA: So, I would imagine
p518
aVthat there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor.
p519
aVMichael Sandel. Thank you so much. (MS: Thanks so much.)

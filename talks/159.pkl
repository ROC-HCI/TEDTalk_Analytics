VI am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most \u2014
p5
aVthe lights are really disturbing my eyes
p6
aVand they're reflecting on my glasses.
p7
aVI am very happy and honored to be amidst
p8
aVvery, very innovative and intelligent people.
p9
aVI have listened to the three previous speakers,
p10
aVand guess what happened?
p11
aVEvery single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,
p12
aVand it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VBut there is a saying in my culture
p17
aVthat if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,
p18
aVthat bud is a young one.
p19
aVSo, I will \u2014 since I am not young and am very old,
p20
aVI still will say something.
p21
aa(lp22
VWe are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,
p23
aVbecause another conference is taking place in Berlin.
p24
aVIt is the G8 Summit.
p25
aVThe G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems
p26
aVshould be a massive increase in aid,
p27
aVsomething akin to the Marshall Plan.
p28
aVUnfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.
p29
aVOne, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.
p30
aVIts largest recipients were Germany and France,
p31
aVand it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.
p32
aVAn average African country receives foreign aid
p33
aVto the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,
p34
aVand that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources
p35
aVfrom rich countries to poor countries.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.
p38
aVHow the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.
p39
aVBy displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,
p40
aVthe media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.
p41
aVHowever, the media is not telling us the whole truth.
p42
aVBecause despair, civil war, hunger and famine,
p43
aValthough they're part and parcel of our African reality,
p44
aVthey are not the only reality.
p45
aVAnd secondly, they are the smallest reality.
p46
aa(lp47
VAfrica has 53 nations.
p48
aVWe have civil wars only in six countries,
p49
aVwhich means that the media are covering only six countries.
p50
aVAfrica has immense opportunities that never navigate
p51
aVthrough the web of despair and helplessness
p52
aVthat the Western media largely presents to its audience.
p53
aVBut the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.
p54
aVIt appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.
p55
aVAnd, as a consequence, the Western view
p56
aVof Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.
p57
aVThe wrong framing is a product of thinking
p58
aVthat Africa is a place of despair.
p59
aVWhat should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.
p60
aVWe should deliver medicines to those who are ill.
p61
aVWe should send peacekeeping troops
p62
aVto serve those who are facing a civil war.
p63
aVAnd in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.
p64
aa(lp65
VI want to say that it is important to recognize
p66
aVthat Africa has fundamental weaknesses.
p67
aVBut equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.
p68
aVWe need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,
p69
aVfrom a challenge of despair,
p70
aVwhich is called poverty reduction,
p71
aVto a challenge of hope.
p72
aVWe frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.
p73
aVThe challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa
p74
aVis not the challenge of reducing poverty.
p75
aVIt should be a challenge of creating wealth.
p76
aa(lp77
VOnce we change those two things \u2014
p78
aVif you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction,
p79
aVyou have the international cartel of good intentions
p80
aVmoving onto the continent, with what?
p81
aVMedicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry,
p82
aVand peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.
p83
aVAnd in the process, none of these things really are productive
p84
aVbecause you are treating the symptoms, not the causes
p85
aVof Africa's fundamental problems.
p86
aVSending somebody to school and giving them medicines,
p87
aVladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.
p88
aVWealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding
p89
aVa profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa,
p92
aVour second challenge will be,
p93
aVwho are the wealth-creating agents in any society?
p94
aVThey are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always
p95
aVabout four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.
p96
aVBut they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.
p97
aVSo, where should we be putting the money?
p98
aVWe need to put money where it can productively grow.
p99
aVSupport private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.
p100
aVSupport research institutions,
p101
aVbecause knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.
p102
aa(lp103
VBut what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?
p104
aVThey are throwing large sums of money for primary health,
p105
aVfor primary education, for food relief.
p106
aVThe entire continent has been turned into
p107
aVa place of despair, in need of charity.
p108
aVLadies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me
p109
aVa neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know,
p110
aVwho became rich by receiving charity?
p111
aVBy holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?
p112
aVDoes any one of you in the audience have that person?
p113
aVDoes any one of you know a country that developed because of
p114
aVthe generosity and kindness of another?
p115
aVWell, since I'm not seeing the hand,
p116
aVit appears that what I'm stating is true.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Bono: Yes!)
p119
aa(lp120
VAndrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country.
p121
aVWhich country is that?
p122
aa(lp123
V(Bono: It's an Irish land.)
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
V(Bono: [unclear])
p128
aa(lp129
VAM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.
p130
aVExternal actors can only present to you an opportunity.
p131
aVThe ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage
p132
aVdepends on your internal capacity.
p133
aVAfrica has received many opportunities.
p134
aVMany of them we haven't benefited much.
p135
aVWhy? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework
p136
aVand policy framework that can make it possible for us
p137
aVto benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example.
p138
aa(lp139
VUnder the Cotonou Agreement,
p140
aVformerly known as the Lome Convention,
p141
aVAfrican countries have been given an opportunity by Europe
p142
aVto export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.
p143
aVMy own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons
p144
aVof sugar to the European Union market.
p145
aVWe haven't exported one kilogram yet.
p146
aVWe import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.
p147
aVSecondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,
p148
aVAfrican countries that produce beef
p149
aVhave quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.
p150
aVNone of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,
p151
aVhas ever met its quota.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's
p154
aVinability to engage the rest of the world
p155
aVin a more productive relationship
p156
aVis because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.
p157
aVAnd all forms of intervention need support,
p158
aVthe evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,
p159
aVthe kinds of institutions that increase productivity.
p160
aVHow do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?
p161
aVAid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?
p162
aVBecause all governments across the world need money to survive.
p163
aVMoney is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.
p164
aVYou have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.
p165
aVAnd because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,
p166
aVthey need really to have the army clobber the opposition.
p167
aVThe second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.
p168
aVWhy should people support their government?
p169
aVWell, because it gives them good, paying jobs,
p170
aVor, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities
p171
aVto profit from corruption.
p172
aa(lp173
VThe fact is no government in the world,
p174
aVwith the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,
p175
aVcan seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.
p176
aVMany countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.
p177
aVTo get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,
p178
aVprimary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.
p179
aVIf the government's fiscal survival
p180
aVdepends on it having to raise money from its own people,
p181
aVsuch a government is driven by self-interest
p182
aVto govern in a more enlightened fashion.
p183
aVIt will sit with those who create wealth.
p184
aVTalk to them about the kind of policies and institutions
p185
aVthat are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business
p186
aVso that it can collect more tax revenues from them.
p187
aVThe problem with the African continent
p188
aVand the problem with the aid industry
p189
aVis that it has distorted the structure of incentives
p190
aVfacing the governments in Africa.
p191
aVThe productive margin in our governments' search for revenue
p192
aVdoes not lie in the domestic economy,
p193
aVit lies with international donors.
p194
aa(lp195
VRather than sit with Ugandan \u2014
p196
aa(lp197
V(Applause) \u2014
p198
aa(lp199
Vrather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs,
p200
aVGhanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,
p201
aVour governments find it more productive
p202
aVto talk to the IMF and the World Bank.
p203
aVI can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,
p204
aVyou can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.
p205
aVWhy? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand
p206
aVthe incentives necessary to expand a business \u2014
p207
aVit requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.
p208
aa(lp209
VGovernments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity,
p210
aVby the international community, to avoid building
p211
aVproductive arrangements with your own citizens,
p212
aVand therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF
p213
aVand the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank
p214
aVthat tell them what its citizens need.
p215
aVIn the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined
p216
aVfrom the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-
p217
aVimplementation process in our countries.
p218
aVWe have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.
p219
aVThe IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world
p220
aVhas taken over our rights as citizens,
p221
aVand therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,
p222
aVis to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut I want to put a caveat on my argument,
p225
aVand that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.
p226
aVSome aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.
p227
aVIt may have built a road, and that road
p228
aVmay have served a very good role.
p229
aVThe mistake of the international aid industry
p230
aVis to pick these isolated incidents of success,
p231
aVgeneralize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,
p232
aVand then spread them across the whole world,
p233
aVignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,
p234
aVthe skills, the practices, the norms and habits
p235
aVthat allowed that small aid project to succeed \u2014
p236
aVlike in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working \u2014
p237
aVand therefore generalize this experience
p238
aVas the experience of everybody.
p239
aa(lp240
VAid increases the resources available to governments,
p241
aVand that makes working in a government the most profitable thing
p242
aVyou can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.
p243
aVBy increasing the political attractiveness of the state,
p244
aVespecially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,
p245
aVaid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions
p246
aVas every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state
p247
aVin order to get access to the foreign aid pie.
p248
aVLadies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa
p249
aVcannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector
p250
aVbecause the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.
p251
aVGovernments are not changing it. Why?
p252
aVBecause they don't need to talk to their own citizens.
p253
aVThey talk to international donors.
p254
aVSo, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,
p255
aVand that has increased the political tensions in our countries
p256
aVprecisely because we depend on aid.
p257
aa(lp258
VI also want to say that it is important for us to
p259
aVnote that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid
p260
aVfrom the international community,
p261
aVin the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,
p262
aVand all other forms of aid.
p263
aVBetween 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,
p264
aVand we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.
p265
aVWhere has all the aid gone?
p266
aa(lp267
VI want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,
p268
aVand the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.
p269
aVIn the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.
p270
aVThe expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.
p271
aVUganda's recurrent expenditure \u2014 by recurrent what do I mean?
p272
aVHand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.
p273
aVWhy does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent
p274
aVof its own revenue?
p275
aVIt's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.
p276
aVBut this shows you that the government of Uganda
p277
aVis not committed to spending its own revenue
p278
aVto invest in productive investments,
p279
aVbut rather it devotes this revenue
p280
aVto paying structure of public expenditure.
p281
aVPublic administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.
p282
aVThe military, 380 billion.
p283
aVAgriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,
p284
aVtakes only 18 billion.
p285
aVTrade and industry takes 43 billion.
p286
aVAnd let me show you, what does public expenditure \u2014
p287
aVrather, public administration expenditure \u2014 in Uganda constitute?
p288
aVThere you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,
p289
aVby the way, who never see the president, except on television.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
V(Applause)
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this,
p296
aVand even there, it is him who advises them.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VWe have 81 units of local government.
p301
aVEach local government is organized like the central government \u2014
p302
aVa bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,
p303
aVand so many jobs for the political hangers-on.
p304
aVThere were 56, and when our president wanted to
p305
aVamend the constitution and remove term limits,
p306
aVhe had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.
p307
aVThree hundred thirty-three members of parliament.
p308
aVYou need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.
p309
aVOne hundred thirty-four commissions
p310
aVand semi-autonomous government bodies,
p311
aVall of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,
p312
aVthis is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.
p313
aa(lp314
VA recent government of Uganda study found
p315
aVthat there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles
p316
aVat the Minister of Health headquarters.
p317
aVUganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,
p318
aVnone of which has an ambulance.
p319
aVSo, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters
p320
aVdrive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats
p321
aVand the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,
p322
aVwhile the poor die without ambulances and medicine.
p323
aa(lp324
VFinally, I want to say that before I came to speak here,
p325
aVI was told that the principle of TEDGlobal
p326
aVis that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.
p327
aVIt should be short enough to arouse interest,
p328
aVbut long enough to cover the subject.
p329
aVI hope I have achieved that.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VThank you very much.

VWhat I thought I would talk about today
p5
aVis the transition from one mode
p6
aVof thinking about nature
p7
aVto another that's tracked by architecture.
p8
aVWhat's interesting about architects is,
p9
aVwe always have tried to justify beauty
p10
aVby looking to nature,
p11
aVand arguably, beautiful architecture
p12
aVhas always been looking at a model of nature.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, for roughly 300 years,
p15
aVthe hot debate in architecture
p16
aVwas whether the number five
p17
aVor the number seven
p18
aVwas a better proportion to think about architecture,
p19
aVbecause the nose was one-fifth of your head,
p20
aVor because your head was one-seventh of your body.
p21
aVAnd the reason that that was the model
p22
aVof beauty and of nature
p23
aVwas because the decimal point had not been invented yet \u2014
p24
aVit wasn't the 16th century \u2014
p25
aVand everybody had to dimension a building
p26
aVin terms of fractions,
p27
aVso a room would be dimensioned
p28
aVas one-fourth of a facade;
p29
aVthe structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units,
p30
aVand you would get down to the small elements
p31
aVby fractional subdivision:
p32
aVfiner and finer and finer.
p33
aa(lp34
VIn the 15th century, the decimal point was invented;
p35
aVarchitects stopped using fractions,
p36
aVand they had a new model of nature.
p37
aVSo, what's going on today
p38
aVis that there's a model of natural form
p39
aVwhich is calculus-based
p40
aVand which is using digital tools,
p41
aVand that has a lot of implications
p42
aVto the way we think about beauty and form,
p43
aVand it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature.
p44
aVThe best example of this would probably be the Gothic,
p45
aVand the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus,
p46
aValthough the Gothic architects
p47
aVweren't really using calculus to define their forms.
p48
aVBut what was important is,
p49
aVthe Gothic moment in architecture was the first time
p50
aVthat force and motion was thought of in terms of form.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo, examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross:
p53
aVyou can see that the structural forces of the vaulting
p54
aVget articulated as lines, so you're really actually seeing
p55
aVthe expression of structural force and form.
p56
aVMuch later, Robert Maillart's bridges,
p57
aVwhich optimize structural form
p58
aVwith a calculus curvature almost like a parabola.
p59
aVThe Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi,
p60
aVthe Catalan architect.
p61
aVThe end of the 19th century, beginning of the 20th century,
p62
aVand how that Hanging Chain model
p63
aVtranslates into archways
p64
aVand vaulting.
p65
aVSo, in all of these examples,
p66
aVstructure is the determining force.
p67
aVFrei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams
p68
aVand foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall.
p69
aVInterestingly, in the last 10 years
p70
aVNorman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model
p71
aVto generate the roof of the National Gallery,
p72
aVwith the structural engineer Chris Williams.
p73
aa(lp74
VIn all these examples,
p75
aVthere's one ideal form,
p76
aVbecause these are thought in terms of structure.
p77
aVAnd as an architect, I've always found these kinds of systems
p78
aVvery limiting, because I'm not interested in ideal forms
p79
aVand I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, what I thought I would bring up is
p82
aVanother component that needs to be thought of,
p83
aVwhenever you think about nature,
p84
aVand that's basically the invention of
p85
aVgeneric form in genetic evolution.
p86
aVMy hero is actually not Darwin;
p87
aVit's a guy named William Bateson,
p88
aVfather of Greg Bateson, who was here for a long time in Monterey.
p89
aVAnd he was what you'd call a teratologist:
p90
aVhe looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations
p91
aVto find rules and laws, rather than looking at the norms.
p92
aVSo, instead of trying to find the ideal type
p93
aVor the ideal average,
p94
aVhe'd always look for the exception. So, in this example,
p95
aVwhich is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule,
p96
aVhe has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb.
p97
aVWhen I first saw this image, 10 years ago,
p98
aVI actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time.
p99
aVBeautiful, because it has symmetry.
p100
aVSo, what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations,
p101
aVinstead of having a thumb,
p102
aVyou would either get another opposable thumb,
p103
aVor you would get four fingers.
p104
aVSo, the mutations reverted to symmetry.
p105
aVAnd Bateson invented
p106
aVthe concept of symmetry breaking,
p107
aVwhich is that
p108
aVwherever you lose information in a system,
p109
aVyou revert back to symmetry.
p110
aVSo, symmetry wasn't the sign of order and organization \u2014
p111
aVwhich is what I was always understanding, and as is an architect \u2014
p112
aVsymmetry was the absence of information.
p113
aVSo, whenever you lost information, you'd move to symmetry;
p114
aVwhenever you added information to a system, you would break symmetry.
p115
aVSo, this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment
p116
aVfrom looking for ideal shapes
p117
aVto looking for a combination of
p118
aVinformation and generic form.
p119
aa(lp120
VYou know, literally after seeing that image,
p121
aVand finding out what Bateson was working with,
p122
aVwe started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching
p123
aVto start to think about architectural form.
p124
aVTo just talk for a minute about the
p125
aVdigital mediums that we're using now
p126
aVand how they integrate calculus:
p127
aVthe fact that they're calculus-based
p128
aVmeans that we don't have to think about dimension
p129
aVin terms of ideal units
p130
aVor discreet elements.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo, in architecture we deal with
p133
aVbig assemblies of components,
p134
aVso there might be up to, say,
p135
aV50,000 pieces of material
p136
aVin this room you're sitting in right now
p137
aVthat all need to get organized.
p138
aVNow, typically you'd think that they would all be the same:
p139
aVlike, the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension.
p140
aVYou know, I haven't verified this, but it's the norm
p141
aVthat every chair would be a slightly different dimension,
p142
aVbecause you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines.
p143
aVThe elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting,
p144
aVthey're all losing their modular quality,
p145
aVand moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions.
p146
aVThat's because we're all using calculus tools
p147
aVfor manufacturing and for design.
p148
aa(lp149
VCalculus is also a mathematics of curves.
p150
aVSo, even a straight line, defined with calculus, is a curve.
p151
aVIt's just a curve without inflection.
p152
aVSo, a new vocabulary of form
p153
aVis now pervading all design fields:
p154
aVwhether it's automobiles, architecture, products, etc.,
p155
aVit's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature.
p156
aVThe intricacies of scale that come out of that \u2014
p157
aVyou know, in the example of the nose to the face,
p158
aVthere's a fractional part-to-whole idea.
p159
aVWith calculus, the whole idea
p160
aVof subdivision is more complex,
p161
aVbecause the whole and the parts are one continuous series.
p162
aVIt's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus,
p163
aVso I brought some images to just describe how that works.
p164
aa(lp165
VThis is a Korean church that we did in Queens.
p166
aVAnd in this example, you can see
p167
aVthat the components of this stair are repetitive,
p168
aVbut they're repetitive without being modular.
p169
aVEach one of the elements in this structure
p170
aVis a unique distance and dimension,
p171
aVand all of the connections are unique angles.
p172
aVNow, the only way we could design that,
p173
aVor possibly construct it,
p174
aVis by using a calculus-based definition
p175
aVof the form.
p176
aVIt also is much more dynamic,
p177
aVso that you can see that the same form opens and closes
p178
aVin a very dynamic way as you move across it,
p179
aVbecause it has this quality of vector in motion
p180
aVbuilt into it.
p181
aVSo the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume,
p182
aVwhen seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista.
p183
aVAnd you also get a sense of
p184
aVvisual movement in the space,
p185
aVbecause every one of the elements is changing in a pattern,
p186
aVso that pattern leads your eye towards the altar.
p187
aVI think that's one of the main changes,
p188
aValso, in architecture:
p189
aVthat we're starting to look now not for some ideal form,
p190
aVlike a Latin cross for a church,
p191
aVbut actually all the traits of a church:
p192
aVso, light that comes from behind from an invisible source,
p193
aVdirectionality that focuses you towards an altar.
p194
aVIt turns out it's not rocket science
p195
aVto design a sacred space.
p196
aVYou just need to incorporate a certain number of traits
p197
aVin a very kind of genetic way.
p198
aVSo, these are the different perspectives of that interior,
p199
aVwhich has a very complex
p200
aVset of orientations all in a simple form.
p201
aa(lp202
VIn terms of construction and manufacturing,
p203
aVthis is a kilometer-long housing block
p204
aVthat was built in the '70s in Amsterdam.
p205
aVAnd here we've broken the 500 apartments
p206
aVup into small neighborhoods,
p207
aVand differentiated those neighborhoods.
p208
aVI won't go into too much description of any of these projects,
p209
aVbut what you can see is that
p210
aVthe escalators and elevators
p211
aVthat circulate people along the face of the building
p212
aVare all held up by
p213
aV122 structural trusses.
p214
aVBecause we're using escalators
p215
aVto move people,
p216
aVall of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads.
p217
aVSo, every one of them is a little bit different-shaped
p218
aVas you move down the length of the building.
p219
aVSo, working with
p220
aVBentley and MicroStation,
p221
aVwe've written a custom piece of software
p222
aVthat networks all of the components together
p223
aVinto these chunks of information,
p224
aVso that if we change any element
p225
aValong the length of the building,
p226
aVnot only does that change distribute
p227
aVthrough each one of the trusses,
p228
aVbut each one of the trusses then distributes that information
p229
aVdown the length of the entire facade of the building.
p230
aVSo it's a single calculation
p231
aVfor every single component of the building
p232
aVthat we're adding onto.
p233
aVSo, it's tens of millions of calculations
p234
aVjust to design one connection between a piece of structural steel
p235
aVand another piece of structural steel.
p236
aVBut what it gives us is a harmonic
p237
aVand synthesized
p238
aVrelationship of all these components, one to another.
p239
aa(lp240
VThis idea has, kind of, brought me into doing
p241
aVsome product design,
p242
aVand it's because design firms
p243
aVthat have connections to architects,
p244
aVlike, I'm working with Vitra, which is a furniture company,
p245
aVand Alessi, which is a houseware company.
p246
aVThey saw this actually solving a problem:
p247
aVthis ability to differentiate components
p248
aVbut keep them synthetic.
p249
aVSo, not to pick on BMW,
p250
aVor to celebrate them,
p251
aVbut take BMW as an example.
p252
aVThey have to, in 2005,
p253
aVhave a distinct identity
p254
aVfor all their models of cars.
p255
aVSo, the 300 series, or whatever their newest car is,
p256
aVthe 100 series that's coming out,
p257
aVhas to look like the 700 series,
p258
aVat the other end of their product line,
p259
aVso they need a distinct, coherent identity,
p260
aVwhich is BMW.
p261
aVAt the same time, there's a person paying 30,000 dollars
p262
aVfor a 300-series car,
p263
aVand a person paying 70,000 dollars
p264
aVfor a 700 series,
p265
aVand that person paying more than double
p266
aVdoesn't want their car to look too much like
p267
aVthe bottom-of-the-market car.
p268
aVSo they have to also discriminate between these products.
p269
aVSo, as manufacturing
p270
aVstarts to allow more
p271
aVdesign options,
p272
aVthis problem gets exacerbated,
p273
aVof the whole and the parts.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow, as an architect, part-to-whole relationships
p276
aVis all I think about,
p277
aVbut in terms of product design
p278
aVit's becoming more and more of an issue for companies.
p279
aVSo, the first kind of test product we did
p280
aVwas with Alessi,
p281
aVwhich was for a coffee and tea set.
p282
aVIt's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set;
p283
aVwe knew that at the beginning. So, I actually went to some people I knew
p284
aVdown south in San Diego,
p285
aVand we used an exploded
p286
aVtitanium forming method
p287
aVthat's used in the aerospace industry.
p288
aVBasically what we can do,
p289
aVis just cut a graphite mold,
p290
aVput it in an oven, heat it to 1,000 degrees,
p291
aVgently inflate titanium that's soft,
p292
aVand then explode it at the last minute into this form.
p293
aVBut what's great about it is,
p294
aVthe forms are only a few hundred dollars.
p295
aVThe titanium's several thousand dollars, but the forms are very cheap.
p296
aVSo, we designed a system here
p297
aVof eight curves that could be swapped,
p298
aVvery similar to that housing project I showed you,
p299
aVand we could recombine those together,
p300
aVso that we always had ergonomic shapes
p301
aVthat always had the same volume
p302
aVand could always be produced in the same way.
p303
aVThat way, each one of these tools we could pay for with
p304
aVa few hundred dollars,
p305
aVand get incredible variation in the components.
p306
aVAnd this is one of those examples of the sets.
p307
aVSo, for me, what was important is that
p308
aVthis coffee set \u2014
p309
aVwhich is just a coffee pot, a teapot,
p310
aVand those are the pots sitting on a tray \u2014
p311
aVthat they would have a coherence \u2014
p312
aVso, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots \u2014
p313
aVbut that everyone who bought one
p314
aVwould have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way.
p315
aa(lp316
VTo go back to architecture,
p317
aVwhat's organic about architecture as a field,
p318
aVunlike product design,
p319
aVis this whole issue of holism
p320
aVand of monumentality is really our realm.
p321
aVLike, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object,
p322
aVbut also break down into small rooms
p323
aVand have an identity of both the big scale
p324
aVand the small scale.
p325
aVArchitects tend to work with signature,
p326
aVso that an architect needs a signature
p327
aVand that signature has to work across the scale of houses
p328
aVup to, say, skyscrapers,
p329
aVand that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining
p330
aVand working with; and intricacy,
p331
aVwhich is the relationship of, say,
p332
aVthe shape of a building, its structure, its windows,
p333
aVits color, its pattern. These are real architectural problems.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo, my kind of hero for this in the natural world
p336
aVare these tropical frogs.
p337
aVI got interested in them because they're the most
p338
aVextreme example
p339
aVof a surface where
p340
aVthe texture and the \u2014 let's call it the decoration \u2014
p341
aVI know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration, but that's how it works \u2014
p342
aVare all intricately connected to one another.
p343
aVSo a change in the form
p344
aVindicates a change in the color pattern.
p345
aVSo, the pattern and the form aren't the same thing,
p346
aVbut they really work together and are fused
p347
aVin some way.
p348
aVSo, when doing a center
p349
aVfor the national parks in Costa Rica,
p350
aVwe tried to use that idea of a gradient color
p351
aVand a change in texture
p352
aVas the structure moves across the surface of the building.
p353
aVWe also used a continuity of change
p354
aVfrom a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum,
p355
aVso it's all one continuous change
p356
aVin the massing,
p357
aVbut within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms.
p358
aa(lp359
VIn a housing project in Valencia, Spain, we're doing,
p360
aVthe different towers of housing fused together
p361
aVin shared curves so you get a single mass,
p362
aVlike a kind of monolith,
p363
aVbut it breaks down into individual elements.
p364
aVAnd you can see that that change in massing
p365
aValso gives all 48 of the apartments
p366
aVa unique shape and size,
p367
aVbut always within a, kind of, controlled limit,
p368
aVan envelope of change.
p369
aa(lp370
VI work with a group of other architects.
p371
aVWe have a company called United Architects.
p372
aVWe were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design.
p373
aVAnd I think this just shows how
p374
aVwe were approaching
p375
aVthe problem of incredibly large-scale construction.
p376
aVWe wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral
p377
aVaround the footprints of the World Trade Center site.
p378
aVAnd to do that, we tried to connect up
p379
aVthe five towers into a single system.
p380
aVAnd we looked at, from the 1950s on,
p381
aVthere were numerous examples of other architects
p382
aVtrying to do the same thing.
p383
aVWe really approached it at the level
p384
aVof the typology of the building,
p385
aVwhere we could build these five separate towers,
p386
aVbut they would all join at the 60th floor
p387
aVand make a kind of single monolithic mass.
p388
aVWith United Architects, also,
p389
aVwe made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters
p390
aVthat used the same system,
p391
aVbut this time in a much more monolithic mass,
p392
aVlike a sphere.
p393
aVBut again, you can see this, kind of,
p394
aVorganic fusion
p395
aVof multiple building elements
p396
aVto make a thing which is whole, but breaks down into smaller parts,
p397
aVbut in an incredibly organic way.
p398
aa(lp399
VFinally, I'd like to just show you
p400
aVsome of the effects of using digital fabrication.
p401
aVAbout six years ago, I bought one of these CNC mills,
p402
aVto just replace, kind of,
p403
aVyoung people cutting their fingers off all the time building models.
p404
aVAnd I also bought a laser cutter
p405
aVand started to fabricate within my own shop,
p406
aVkind of, large-scale building elements and models,
p407
aVwhere we could go directly to the tooling.
p408
aVWhat I found out is that the tooling,
p409
aVif you intervened in the software,
p410
aVactually produced decorative effects.
p411
aVSo, for these interiors, like this shop in Stockholm, Sweden,
p412
aVor this installation wall in the Netherlands
p413
aVat the Netherlands Architecture Institute,
p414
aVwe could use the texture that the tool would leave
p415
aVto produce a lot of the spatial effects,
p416
aVand we could integrate the texture of the wall
p417
aVwith the form of the wall with the material.
p418
aVSo, in vacuum-formed plastic, in fiberglass,
p419
aVand then even at the level of structural steel,
p420
aVwhich you think of as being linear and modular.
p421
aVThe steel industry is so far
p422
aVahead of the design industry
p423
aVthat if you take advantage of it
p424
aVyou can even start to think of beams and columns
p425
aVall rolled together into a single system
p426
aVwhich is highly efficient,
p427
aVbut also produces decorative effects
p428
aVand formal effects
p429
aVthat are very beautiful and organic.
p430
aVThanks very much.

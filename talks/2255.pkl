VSo if I told you that this was the face of pure joy,
p5
aVwould you call me crazy?
p6
aVI wouldn't blame you,
p7
aVbecause every time I look at this Arctic selfie, I shiver just a little bit.
p8
aVI want to tell you a little bit about this photograph.
p9
aa(lp10
VI was swimming around in the Lofoten Islands in Norway,
p11
aVjust inside the Arctic Circle,
p12
aVand the water was hovering right at freezing.
p13
aVThe air? A brisk -10 with windchill,
p14
aVand I could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands,
p15
aVfeet and face, and rush to protect my vital organs.
p16
aVIt was the coldest I've ever been.
p17
aVBut even with swollen lips, sunken eyes, and cheeks flushed red,
p18
aVI have found that this place right here is somewhere I can find great joy.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, when it comes to pain, psychologist Brock Bastian
p21
aVprobably said it best when he wrote,
p22
aV"Pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness.
p23
aVIt makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment.
p24
aVIt brutally draws us in
p25
aVto a virtual sensory awareness of the world much like meditation."
p26
aa(lp27
VIf shivering is a form of meditation, then I would consider myself a monk.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, before we get into the why
p31
aVwould anyone ever want to surf in freezing cold water?
p32
aVI would love to give you a little perspective
p33
aVon what a day in my life can look like.
p34
aa(lp35

p36
aa(lp37
V(Video) Man: I mean, I know we were hoping for good waves,
p38
aVbut I don't think anybody thought that was going to happen.
p39
aVI can't stop shaking.
p40
aVI am so cold.

VChris Burkard: So, surf photographer, right?
p47
aVI don't even know if it's a real job title, to be honest.
p48
aVMy parents definitely didn't think so
p49
aVwhen I told them at 19 I was quitting my job to pursue this dream career:
p50
aVblue skies, warm tropical beaches, and a tan that lasts all year long.
p51
aVI mean, to me, this was it. Life could not get any better.
p52
aVSweating it out, shooting surfers in these exotic tourist destinations.
p53
aVBut there was just this one problem.
p54
aVYou see, the more time I spent traveling to these exotic locations,
p55
aVthe less gratifying it seemed to be.
p56
aVI set out seeking adventure, and what I was finding was only routine.
p57
aVIt was things like wi-fi, TV, fine dining, and a constant cellular connection
p58
aVthat to me were all the trappings of places heavily touristed
p59
aVin and out of the water,
p60
aVand it didn't take long for me to start feeling suffocated.
p61
aa(lp62
VI began craving wild, open spaces,
p63
aVand so I set out to find the places others had written off
p64
aVas too cold, too remote, and too dangerous to surf,
p65
aVand that challenge intrigued me.
p66
aVI began this sort of personal crusade against the mundane,
p67
aVbecause if there's one thing I've realized,
p68
aVit's that any career,
p69
aVeven one as seemingly glamorous as surf photography,
p70
aVhas the danger of becoming monotonous.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo in my search to break up this monotony, I realized something:
p73
aVThere's only about a third of the Earth's oceans that are warm,
p74
aVand it's really just that thin band around the equator.
p75
aVSo if I was going to find perfect waves,
p76
aVit was probably going to happen somewhere cold,
p77
aVwhere the seas are notoriously rough,
p78
aVand that's exactly where I began to look.
p79
aVAnd it was my first trip to Iceland
p80
aVthat I felt like I found exactly what I was looking for.
p81
aa(lp82
VI was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape,
p83
aVbut most importantly, I couldn't believe we were finding perfect waves
p84
aVin such a remote and rugged part of the world.
p85
aVAt one point, we got to the beach
p86
aVonly to find massive chunks of ice had piled on the shoreline.
p87
aVThey created this barrier between us and the surf,
p88
aVand we had to weave  through this thing like a maze
p89
aVjust to get out into the lineup.
p90
aVand once we got there,
p91
aVwe were pushing aside these ice chunks trying to get into waves.
p92
aVIt was an incredible experience, one I'll never forget,
p93
aVbecause amidst those harsh conditions,
p94
aVI felt like I stumbled onto one of the last quiet places,
p95
aVsomewhere that I found a clarity and a connection with the world
p96
aVI knew I would never find on a crowded beach.
p97
aa(lp98
VI was hooked. I was hooked. (Laughter)
p99
aVCold water was constantly on my mind,
p100
aVand from that point on,
p101
aVmy career focused on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments,
p102
aVand it took me to places like Russia, Norway, Alaska, Iceland, Chile,
p103
aVthe Faroe Islands, and a lot of places in between.
p104
aVAnd one of my favorite things about these places
p105
aVwas simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there:
p106
aVhours, days, weeks spent on Google Earth
p107
aVtrying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to.
p108
aVAnd once we got there, the vehicles were just as creative:
p109
aVsnowmobiles, six-wheel Soviet troop carriers,
p110
aVand a couple of super-sketchy helicopter flights.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVHelicopters really scare me, by the way.
p113
aa(lp114
VThere was this one particularly bumpy boat ride
p115
aVup the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot,
p116
aVwhere we ended up watching helplessly from the water
p117
aVas bears ravaged our camp site.
p118
aVThey walked off with our food and bits of our tent,
p119
aVclearly letting us know that we were at the bottom of the food chain
p120
aVand that this was their spot, not ours.
p121
aVBut to me, that trip
p122
aVwas a testament to the wildness I traded for those touristy beaches.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, it wasn't until I traveled to Norway \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p125
aVthat I really learned to appreciate the cold.
p126
aVSo this is the place
p127
aVwhere some of the largest, the most violent storms in the world
p128
aVsend huge waves smashing into the coastline.
p129
aVWe were in this tiny, remote fjord, just inside the Arctic Circle.
p130
aVIt had a greater population of sheep than people,
p131
aVso help if we needed it was nowhere to be found.
p132
aVI was in the water  taking pictures of surfers,
p133
aVand it started to snow.
p134
aVAnd then the temperature began to drop.
p135
aVAnd I told myself, there's not a chance you're getting out of the water.
p136
aVYou traveled all this way, and this is exactly what you've been waiting for:
p137
aVfreezing cold conditions with perfect waves.
p138
aVAnd although I couldn't even feel my finger to push the trigger,
p139
aVI knew I wasn't getting out.
p140
aVSo I just did whatever I could. I shook it off, whatever.
p141
aVBut that was the point that I felt
p142
aVthis wind gush through the valley and hit me,
p143
aVand what started as this light snowfall quickly became a full-on blizzard,
p144
aVand I started to lose perception of where I was.
p145
aVI didn't know if I was drifting out to sea or towards shore,
p146
aVand all I could really make out was the faint sound of seagulls
p147
aVand crashing waves.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, I knew this place had a reputation for sinking ships and grounding planes,
p150
aVand while I was out there floating, I started to get a little bit nervous.
p151
aVActually, I was totally freaking out \u2014
p152
aV(Laughter) \u2014 and I was borderline hypothermic,
p153
aVand my friends eventually had to help me out of the water.
p154
aVAnd I don't know if it was delirium setting in or what,
p155
aVbut they told me later
p156
aVI had a smile on my face the entire time.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, it was this trip
p159
aVand probably that exact experience where I really began to feel
p160
aVlike every photograph was precious,
p161
aVbecause all of a sudden in that moment, it was something I was forced to earn.
p162
aVAnd I realized, all this shivering had actually taught me something:
p163
aVIn life, there are no shortcuts to joy.
p164
aVAnything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer
p165
aVjust a little bit,
p166
aVand that tiny bit of suffering that I did for my photography,
p167
aVit added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me
p168
aVthan just trying to fill the pages of magazines.
p169
aVSee, I gave a piece of myself in these places,
p170
aVand what I walked away with
p171
aVwas a sense of fulfillment I had always been searching for.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo I look back at this photograph.
p174
aVIt's easy to see frozen fingers and cold wetsuits
p175
aVand even the struggle that it took just to get there,
p176
aVbut most of all, what I see is just joy.
p177
aa(lp178
VThank you so much.

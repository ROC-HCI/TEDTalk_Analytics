VI have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother
p5
aVwho died in her exile:
p6
aV"Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him.
p7
aVBut don't you ever turn
p8
aVinto a Gaddafi-like revolutionary."
p9
aa(lp10
VAlmost two years have passed
p11
aVsince the Libyan Revolution broke out,
p12
aVinspired by the waves of mass mobilization
p13
aVin both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions.
p14
aVI joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya
p15
aVto call for a day of rage
p16
aVand to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi.
p17
aVAnd there it was, a great revolution.
p18
aVYoung Libyan women and men were at the forefront
p19
aVcalling for the fall of the regime,
p20
aVraising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.
p21
aVThey have shown an exemplary bravery
p22
aVin confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi.
p23
aVThey have shown a great sense of solidarity
p24
aVfrom the far east to the far west to the south.
p25
aVEventually, after a period of six months of brutal war
p26
aVand a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead,
p27
aVwe managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Applause)
p30
aa(lp31
VHowever, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden,
p32
aVa legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions.
p33
aVFor four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime
p34
aVdestroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society.
p35
aVAware of the devastation and the challenges,
p36
aVI was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society,
p37
aVcalling for an inclusive and just transition
p38
aVto democracy and national reconciliation.
p39
aVAlmost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi
p40
aVduring and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi \u2014
p41
aValmost 300 in Tripoli.
p42
aa(lp43
VAfter a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya,
p44
aVand with unique enthusiasm,
p45
aVI started organizing workshops
p46
aVon capacity building, on human development of leadership skills.
p47
aVWith an amazing group of women,
p48
aVI co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace,
p49
aVa movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life,
p50
aVto lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women
p51
aVand to lobby for our right
p52
aVfor equal participation in building democracy and peace.
p53
aa(lp54
VI met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections,
p55
aVan environment which was increasingly polarized,
p56
aVan environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion.
p57
aVI led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace
p58
aVto lobby for a more inclusive electoral law,
p59
aVa law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background,
p60
aVthe right to vote and run,
p61
aVand most importantly to stipulate on political parties
p62
aVthe alternation of male and female candidates
p63
aVvertically and horizontally in their lists,
p64
aVcreating the zipper list.
p65
aVEventually, our initiative was adopted and successful.
p66
aVWomen won 17.5 percent of the National Congress
p67
aVin the first elections ever in 52 years.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Applause)
p70
aa(lp71
VHowever, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections,
p72
aVand of the revolution as a whole,
p73
aVwas fading out \u2014
p74
aVfor every day we were waking up to the news of violence.
p75
aVOne day we wake up to the news
p76
aVof the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs.
p77
aVOn another day we wake up to the news
p78
aVof the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate.
p79
aVOn another day we wake up to the news
p80
aVof the assassination of army officers.
p81
aVAnd every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias
p82
aVand their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners
p83
aVand their disrespect of the rule of law.
p84
aa(lp85
VOur society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset,
p86
aVbecame more polarized
p87
aVand has driven away from the ideals and the principles \u2014
p88
aVfreedom, dignity, social justice \u2014
p89
aVthat we first held.
p90
aVIntolerance, exclusion and revenge
p91
aVbecame the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution.
p92
aVI am here today not at all to inspire you
p93
aVwith our success story of the zipper list and the elections.
p94
aVI'm rather here today to confess
p95
aVthat we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.
p96
aVWe did not prioritize right.
p97
aVFor elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya.
p98
aVDid the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates
p99
aVbring peace and national reconciliation?
p100
aVNo, it didn't.
p101
aVWhat is it, then?
p102
aVWhy does our society continue to be polarized and dominated
p103
aVwith selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?
p104
aa(lp105
VMaybe what was missing was not the women only,
p106
aVbut the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
p107
aVOur society needs national dialogue and consensus-building
p108
aVmore than it needed the elections,
p109
aVwhich only reinforced polarization and division.
p110
aVOur society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine
p111
aVmore than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine.
p112
aa(lp113
VWe need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage.
p114
aVWe need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
p115
aVWe need to develop a feminine discourse
p116
aVthat not only honors but also implements
p117
aVmercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition,
p118
aVinclusion instead of exclusion.
p119
aVThese are the ideals that a war-torn Libya
p120
aVneeds desperately in order to achieve peace.
p121
aa(lp122
VFor peace has an alchemy,
p123
aVand this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation
p124
aVbetween the feminine and masculine perspectives.
p125
aVThat's the real zipper.
p126
aVAnd we need to establish that existentially
p127
aVbefore we do so sociopolitically.
p128
aa(lp129
VAccording to a Quranic verse
p130
aV"Salam" \u2014 peace \u2014 "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem."
p131
aVIn turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions,
p132
aVhas the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" \u2014 womb \u2014
p133
aVsymbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity
p134
aVfrom which the male and the female,
p135
aVfrom which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.
p136
aVAnd so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it,
p137
aVthe divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.
p138
aVThus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things."
p139
aVThus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger."
p140
aa(lp141
VMay we all be granted a grace of mercy.
p142
aV(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VThank you.

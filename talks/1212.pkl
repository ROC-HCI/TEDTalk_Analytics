VSo, I was in the hospital for a long time.
p5
aVAnd a few years after I left, I went back,
p6
aVand the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me \u2014
p7
aVsaid, "Dan, I have a fantastic new treatment for you."
p8
aVI was very excited. I walked with him to his office.
p9
aVAnd he explained to me that, when I shave,
p10
aVI have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is,
p11
aVbut on the right side of my face
p12
aVI was badly burned so I have no hair,
p13
aVand this creates lack of symmetry.
p14
aVAnd what's the brilliant idea he had?
p15
aVHe was going to tattoo little black dots
p16
aVon the right side of my face
p17
aVand make me look very symmetric.
p18
aa(lp19
VIt sounded interesting. He asked me to go and shave.
p20
aVLet me tell you, this was a strange way to shave,
p21
aVbecause I thought about it
p22
aVand I realized that the way I was shaving then
p23
aVwould be the way I would shave for the rest of my life \u2014
p24
aVbecause I had to keep the width the same.
p25
aVWhen I got back to his office,
p26
aVI wasn't really sure.
p27
aVI said, "Can I see some evidence for this?"
p28
aVSo he showed me some pictures
p29
aVof little cheeks with little black dots \u2014
p30
aVnot very informative.
p31
aVI said, "What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white?
p32
aVWhat would happen then?"
p33
aV"Oh, don't worry about it," he said.
p34
aV"We have lasers; we can whiten it out."
p35
aVBut I was still concerned,
p36
aVso I said, "You know what, I'm not going to do it."
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life.
p39
aVThis is coming from a Jewish guy, all right, so that means a lot.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVAnd he said, "Dan, what's wrong with you?
p42
aVDo you enjoy looking non-symmetric?
p43
aVDo you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this?
p44
aVDo women feel pity for you
p45
aVand have sex with you more frequently?"
p46
aVNone of those happened.
p47
aVAnd this was very surprising to me,
p48
aVbecause I've gone through many treatments \u2014
p49
aVthere were many treatments I decided not to do \u2014
p50
aVand I never got this guilt trip to this extent.
p51
aVBut I decided not to have this treatment.
p52
aVAnd I went to his deputy and asked him, "What was going on?
p53
aVWhere was this guilt trip coming from?"
p54
aVAnd he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already,
p55
aVand they need the third patient for a paper they were writing.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VNow you probably think that this guy's a schmuck.
p60
aVRight, that's what he seems like.
p61
aVBut let me give you a different perspective on the same story.
p62
aVA few years ago, I was running some of my own experiments in the lab.
p63
aVAnd when we run experiments,
p64
aVwe usually hope that one group will behave differently than another.
p65
aVSo we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high,
p66
aVanother group that I thought their performance would be very low,
p67
aVand when I got the results, that's what we got \u2014
p68
aVI was very happy \u2014 aside from one person.
p69
aVThere was one person in the group
p70
aVthat was supposed to have very high performance
p71
aVthat was actually performing terribly.
p72
aVAnd he pulled the whole mean down,
p73
aVdestroying my statistical significance of the test.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo I looked carefully at this guy.
p76
aVHe was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample.
p77
aVAnd I remembered that the old and drunken guy
p78
aVcame one day to the lab
p79
aVwanting to make some easy cash
p80
aVand this was the guy.
p81
aV"Fantastic!" I thought. "Let's throw him out.
p82
aVWho would ever include a drunken guy in a sample?"
p83
aa(lp84
VBut a couple of days later,
p85
aVwe thought about it with my students,
p86
aVand we said, "What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition?
p87
aVWhat would have happened if he was in the other group?
p88
aVWould we have thrown him out then?"
p89
aVWe probably wouldn't have looked at the data at all,
p90
aVand if we did look at the data,
p91
aVwe'd probably have said, "Fantastic! What a smart guy who is performing this low,"
p92
aVbecause he would have pulled the mean of the group lower,
p93
aVgiving us even stronger statistical results than we could.
p94
aVSo we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut you know, these stories,
p97
aVand lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest,
p98
aVbasically kind of bring two points
p99
aVto the foreground for me.
p100
aVThe first one is that in life we encounter many people
p101
aVwho, in some way or another,
p102
aVtry to tattoo our faces.
p103
aVThey just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality
p104
aVand give us advice that is inherently biased.
p105
aVAnd I'm sure that it's something that we all recognize,
p106
aVand we see that it happens.
p107
aVMaybe we don't recognize it every time,
p108
aVbut we understand that it happens.
p109
aa(lp110
VThe most difficult thing, of course, is to recognize
p111
aVthat sometimes we too
p112
aVare blinded by our own incentives.
p113
aVAnd that's a much, much more difficult lesson to take into account.
p114
aVBecause we don't see how conflicts of interest work on us.
p115
aVWhen I was doing these experiments,
p116
aVin my mind, I was helping science.
p117
aVI was eliminating the data
p118
aVto get the true pattern of the data to shine through.
p119
aVI wasn't doing something bad.
p120
aVIn my mind, I was actually a knight
p121
aVtrying to help science move along.
p122
aVBut this was not the case.
p123
aVI was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions.
p124
aVAnd I think the real challenge is to figure out
p125
aVwhere are the cases in our lives
p126
aVwhere conflicts of interest work on us,
p127
aVand try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it,
p128
aVbut to try to do things
p129
aVthat prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors,
p130
aVbecause we can create lots of undesirable circumstances.
p131
aa(lp132
VI do want to leave you with one positive thought.
p133
aVI mean, this is all very depressing, right \u2014
p134
aVpeople have conflicts of interest, we don't see it, and so on.
p135
aVThe positive perspective, I think, of all of this
p136
aVis that, if we do understand when we go wrong,
p137
aVif we understand the deep mechanisms
p138
aVof why we fail and where we fail,
p139
aVwe can actually hope to fix things.
p140
aVAnd that, I think, is the hope. Thank you very much.

VThis is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement.
p5
aVThis might be the most important sneaker in history.
p6
aVFirst released in 1988,
p7
aVthis is the shoe that started Nike marketing as we know it.
p8
aVThis is the shoe that propelled the entire Air Jordan lineage,
p9
aVand perhaps saved Nike.
p10
aVThe Air Jordan 3 Black Cement did for sneakers
p11
aVwhat the iPhone did for phones.
p12
aVIt's been re-released four times.
p13
aVEvery celebrity's been seen wearing it.
p14
aVThere's a site about what to wear with the Black Cement.
p15
aVIt's been right under your nose for decades
p16
aVand you never looked down.
p17
aVAnd right about now,
p18
aVmost of you are probably thinking, "Sneakers?"
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VYes.
p23
aVYes, sneakers.
p24
aVSome extraordinary things about sneakers
p25
aVand data
p26
aVand Nike
p27
aVand how they're all related, possibly, to the future of all online commerce.
p28
aa(lp29
VIn 2011,
p30
aVthe last time the Jordan 3 Black Cement was released,
p31
aVat a retail of 160 dollars,
p32
aVit sold out globally in minutes.
p33
aVAnd that's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores
p34
aVfor days before it went on sale.
p35
aVAnd just minutes after that,
p36
aVthousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail.
p37
aVIn fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay right now, four years later.
p38
aVBut here's the thing:
p39
aVthis happens every single Saturday.
p40
aVEvery week there's another release or two or three,
p41
aVand every shoe has a story
p42
aVas rich and compelling as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.
p43
aa(lp44
VThis is Nike building the marketplace for sneakerheads \u2014
p45
aVpeople who collect sneakers \u2014
p46
aVand my daughter.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VThat's an "I love Dad" T-shirt.
p51
aa(lp52
VFor the brands, sneakerheads are a very important demographic.
p53
aVThese are the tastemakers; these are the Apple fanboys.
p54
aVBecause who else is going to buy
p55
aVa pair of $8,000 Back to the Future sneakers?
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VYeah, 8,000 dollars.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd while that's obviously the anomaly,
p62
aVthe resell sneaker market is definitely not.
p63
aVThirty years in the making,
p64
aVwhat started as an underground culture
p65
aVof a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much \u2014
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VNow we have sneaker addictions.
p70
aVIn a market where in the past 12 months,
p71
aVthere have been over nine million pairs of shoes
p72
aVresold in the United States alone,
p73
aVat a value of 1.2 billion dollars.
p74
aVAnd that's a conservative estimate \u2014
p75
aVI should know, I am a sneakerhead.
p76
aVThis is my collection.
p77
aVIn the pantheon of great collections, mine doesn't even register.
p78
aVI have about 250 pairs, but trust me, I am small-time.
p79
aVPeople have thousands.
p80
aa(lp81
VI'm a very typical 37-year-old sneakerhead.
p82
aVI grew up playing basketball when Michael Jordan played,
p83
aVI always wanted Air Jordans,
p84
aVmy mother would never buy me Air Jordans,
p85
aVas soon as I got some money I bought Air Jordans \u2014
p86
aVliterally, we all have the exact same story.
p87
aVBut here's where mine diverged.
p88
aVAfter starting three companies, I took a job as a strategy consultant,
p89
aVwhen I very quickly realized that I didn't know the first thing about data.
p90
aVBut I learned, because I had to,
p91
aVand I liked it.
p92
aVSo I thought, I wonder if I could get ahold of some sneaker data,
p93
aVjust to play with for my own amusement.
p94
aVThe goal was to develop a price guide,
p95
aVa real data-driven view of the market.
p96
aVAnd four years later, we're analyzing over 25 million transactions,
p97
aVproviding real-time analytics on thousands of sneakers.
p98
aVNow sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases.
p99
aVOthers have used the data to validate insurance claims.
p100
aVAnd the top investment banks in the world
p101
aVnow use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry.
p102
aVAnd here's the best part:
p103
aVsneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VSneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time,
p108
aVcompare it to others,
p109
aVand have access to the same analytics you might
p110
aVfor your online brokerage account.
p111
aVSo sneakerhead Dan builds his collection and identifies which 352 are his.
p112
aVHe can see it's worth 103,000 dollars \u2014
p113
aVfrankly, a modest collection.
p114
aVAt the asset level, he can see gain-loss by shoe.
p115
aVHere he's made over 600 dollars on one pair.
p116
aVI have one of those.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VSo an unregulated 1.2 billion dollar industry
p121
aVthat thrives as much on the street as it does online,
p122
aVand has spawned fundamental financial services for sneakers?
p123
aVAt some point I asked myself what's really going on in the market,
p124
aVand two comparisons started to emerge.
p125
aVAre sneakers more like stocks or drugs?
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VIn fact, one guy emailed to say
p130
aVhe thought his 15-year-old son was selling drugs
p131
aVand later found out he was selling sneakers.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd now they use the data to do it together.
p136
aVAnd that's because sneakers are an investment opportunity
p137
aVwhere none other exists.
p138
aVAnd I don't just mean the kid selling sneakers instead of drugs.
p139
aVHow about all kids?
p140
aVYou have to be 18 to play the stock market.
p141
aVI sold chewing gum in sixth grade,
p142
aVBlow Pops in ninth grade
p143
aVand collected baseball cards through high school.
p144
aVThe cards are long dead,
p145
aVand the candy market's usually quite local.
p146
aa(lp147
VFor a lot of people, sneakers are a legal and accessible investment opportunity \u2014
p148
aVa democratized stock market,
p149
aVbut also unregulated.
p150
aVWhich is why the story you're probably most familiar with
p151
aVis people killing each other for sneakers.
p152
aVAnd while that definitely happens and is tragic,
p153
aVit's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe.
p154
aVIn fact, it's a very small piece of a much bigger and better story.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo sneakers have clear similarities
p157
aVto both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade,
p158
aVbut perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor.
p159
aVSomeone is making the rules.
p160
aVIn the case of sneakers, that someone is Nike.
p161
aa(lp162
VLet me walk you through some numbers.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe resell market, we know, is $1.2 billion.
p165
aVNike, including Jordan brand,
p166
aVaccounts for 96 percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market.
p167
aVJust complete domination.
p168
aVSneakerheads love Jordans.
p169
aVAnd profit on the secondary market is about a third.
p170
aVThat means that sneakerheads made 380 million dollars
p171
aVselling Nikes last year.
p172
aVLet's jump to retail for a second.
p173
aVSkechers, earlier this year,
p174
aVbecame the number two footwear brand in the country,
p175
aVsurpassing Adidas \u2014 this was a big deal.
p176
aVAnd in the 12 months ending in June,
p177
aVSkechers's net income was 209 million dollars.
p178
aVThat means that Nike's customers
p179
aVmake almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor.
p180
aVThat \u2014
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VHow is that even possible?
p185
aa(lp186
VThe sneaker market is just supply and demand,
p187
aVbut Nike's gotten very good at using supply \u2014 limited sneakers \u2014
p188
aVand the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit.
p189
aVSo it's really just supply.
p190
aVSneakerheads joke that as long as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it.
p191
aVShoes that sell for 8,000 dollars do so because they're very rare.
p192
aVIt's no different than any other collectible market,
p193
aVonly this isn't a market at all.
p194
aVIt's a false construct created by Nike \u2014
p195
aVingeniously created by Nike, in the most positive sense \u2014 to sell more shoes.
p196
aVAnd in the process,
p197
aVit provided tens of thousands of people with life-long passions,
p198
aVmyself included.
p199
aVIf Nike wanted to kill the resell market, they could do so tomorrow,
p200
aVall they have to do is release more shoes.
p201
aVBut we certainly don't want them to, nor is it in their best interest.
p202
aVThat's because unlike Apple, who will sell an iPhone to anyone who wants one,
p203
aVNike doesn't make their money by just selling $200 sneakers.
p204
aVThey sell millions of shoes to millions of people for 60 dollars.
p205
aVAnd sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing
p206
aVand the hype and the PR and the brand cachet,
p207
aVand enable Nike to sell millions of $60 sneakers.
p208
aa(lp209
VIt's marketing.
p210
aVIt's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before \u2014
p211
aVthis isn't in any textbook.
p212
aVFor 15 years Nike has propped up an artificial commodities market,
p213
aVwith a Facebook-level hyped IPO every single weekend.
p214
aVDrive by any Footlocker at 8am on a Saturday morning,
p215
aVand there will be a line down the street and around the block,
p216
aVand sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week.
p217
aVYou know those crazy iPhone lines you see on the news every other year?
p218
aVNike lines happen 104 times more often.
p219
aVSo Nike sets the rules.
p220
aVAnd they do so by controlling supply and distribution.
p221
aa(lp222
VBut once a pair leaves the retail channel, it's the Wild West.
p223
aVThere are very few \u2014 if any \u2014 legal, unregulated markets of this size.
p224
aVSo Nike is definitely not the stock exchange.
p225
aVIn fact, there is no central exchange.
p226
aVBy last count, there were 48 different online markets that I know of.
p227
aVSome are eBay clones, some are mobile markets,
p228
aVand then you have consignment shops and brick-and-mortar stores,
p229
aVand sneaker conventions, and reseller sites,
p230
aVand Facebook and Instagram and Twitter \u2014
p231
aVliterally, anywhere sneakerheads come into contact with each other,
p232
aVshoes will be bought and sold.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut that means no efficiencies, no transparency,
p235
aVsometimes not even authenticity.
p236
aVCan you imagine if that's how stocks were bought?
p237
aVWhat if the way to buy a share of Apple stock
p238
aVwas to search over 100 places online and off,
p239
aVincluding every time you walk down the street
p240
aVjust hoping to pass someone wearing some Apple stock?
p241
aVNever knowing who had the best price,
p242
aVor even if the stock you were looking at was real.
p243
aVThat would surely make you say:
p244
aa(lp245
V[WTF?]
p246
aa(lp247
VOf course that's not how we buy stock.
p248
aVBut what if that's not how we need to buy sneakers either?
p249
aVWhat if the inverse is true,
p250
aVand what if we could buy sneakers
p251
aVexactly the same way as we buy stock?
p252
aVAnd what if it wasn't just sneakers, but any similar product,
p253
aVlike watches and handbags and women's shoes,
p254
aVand any collectible, any seasonal item and any markdown item?
p255
aVWhat if there was a stock market for commerce?
p256
aVA stock market of things.
p257
aVAnd not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner,
p258
aVbut you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions
p259
aVyou can with the stock market.
p260
aVShorts and options and futures
p261
aVand well, maybe you see where this is going.
p262
aVMaybe you want to invest in a stock market of things.
p263
aVBecause if you had invested in a pair of Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011,
p264
aVyou could either be wearing them onstage,
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
Vor have earned 162 percent on your money \u2014
p269
aVdouble the S&P and 20 percent more than Apple.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd that's why we're talking about sneakers.
p274
aa(lp275
VThank you.
p276

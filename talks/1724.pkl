VLet's face it:
p5
aVDriving is dangerous.
p6
aVIt's one of the things that we don't like to think about,
p7
aVbut the fact that religious icons and good luck charms
p8
aVshow up on dashboards around the world
p9
aVbetrays the fact that we know this to be true.
p10
aVCar accidents are the leading cause of death
p11
aVin people ages 16 to 19 in the United States \u2014
p12
aVleading cause of death \u2014
p13
aVand 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do
p14
aVwith drugs or alcohol.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo what happens?
p17
aVNo one can say for sure, but I remember my first accident.
p18
aVI was a young driver out on the highway,
p19
aVand the car in front of me, I saw the brake lights go on.
p20
aVI'm like, "Okay, all right, this guy is slowing down,
p21
aVI'll slow down too."
p22
aVI step on the brake.
p23
aVBut no, this guy isn't slowing down.
p24
aVThis guy is stopping, dead stop, dead stop on the highway.
p25
aVIt was just going 65 \u2014 to zero?
p26
aVI slammed on the brakes.
p27
aVI felt the ABS kick in, and the car is still going,
p28
aVand it's not going to stop, and I know it's not going to stop,
p29
aVand the air bag deploys, the car is totaled,
p30
aVand fortunately, no one was hurt.
p31
aVBut I had no idea that car was stopping,
p32
aVand I think we can do a lot better than that.
p33
aVI think we can transform the driving experience
p34
aVby letting our cars talk to each other.
p35
aa(lp36
VI just want you to think a little bit
p37
aVabout what the experience of driving is like now.
p38
aVGet into your car. Close the door. You're in a glass bubble.
p39
aVYou can't really directly sense the world around you.
p40
aVYou're in this extended body.
p41
aVYou're tasked with navigating it down
p42
aVpartially-seen roadways,
p43
aVin and amongst other metal giants, at super-human speeds.
p44
aVOkay? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes.
p45
aVOkay, so that's all you have,
p46
aVeyes that weren't really designed for this task,
p47
aVbut then people ask you to do things like,
p48
aVyou want to make a lane change,
p49
aVwhat's the first thing they ask you do?
p50
aVTake your eyes off the road. That's right.
p51
aVStop looking where you're going, turn,
p52
aVcheck your blind spot,
p53
aVand drive down the road without looking where you're going.
p54
aVYou and everyone else. This is the safe way to drive.
p55
aVWhy do we do this? Because we have to,
p56
aVwe have to make a choice, do I look here or do I look here?
p57
aVWhat's more important?
p58
aVAnd usually we do a fantastic job
p59
aVpicking and choosing what we attend to on the road.
p60
aVBut occasionally we miss something.
p61
aVOccasionally we sense something wrong or too late.
p62
aVIn countless accidents, the driver says,
p63
aV"I didn't see it coming."
p64
aVAnd I believe that. I believe that.
p65
aVWe can only watch so much.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut the technology exists now that can help us improve that.
p68
aVIn the future, with cars exchanging data with each other,
p69
aVwe will be able to see not just three cars ahead
p70
aVand three cars behind, to the right and left,
p71
aVall at the same time, bird's eye view,
p72
aVwe will actually be able to see into those cars.
p73
aVWe will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us,
p74
aVto see how fast that guy's going or stopping.
p75
aVIf that guy's going down to zero, I'll know.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd with computation and algorithms and predictive models,
p78
aVwe will be able to see the future.
p79
aVYou may think that's impossible.
p80
aVHow can you predict the future? That's really hard.
p81
aVActually, no. With cars, it's not impossible.
p82
aVCars are three-dimensional objects
p83
aVthat have a fixed position and velocity.
p84
aVThey travel down roads.
p85
aVOften they travel on pre-published routes.
p86
aVIt's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions
p87
aVabout where a car's going to be in the near future.
p88
aVEven if, when you're in your car
p89
aVand some motorcyclist comes \u2014 bshoom! \u2014
p90
aV85 miles an hour down, lane-splitting \u2014
p91
aVI know you've had this experience \u2014
p92
aVthat guy didn't "just come out of nowhere."
p93
aVThat guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aVRight? I mean, somebody's seen him.
p96
aVTen, 20, 30 miles back, someone's seen that guy,
p97
aVand as soon as one car sees that guy
p98
aVand puts him on the map, he's on the map \u2014
p99
aVposition, velocity,
p100
aVgood estimate he'll continue going 85 miles an hour.
p101
aVYou'll know, because your car will know, because
p102
aVthat other car will have whispered something in his ear,
p103
aVlike, "By the way, five minutes,
p104
aVmotorcyclist, watch out."
p105
aVYou can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave.
p106
aVI mean, they're Newtonian objects.
p107
aVThat's very nice about them.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo how do we get there?
p110
aVWe can start with something as simple
p111
aVas sharing our position data between cars,
p112
aVjust sharing GPS.
p113
aVIf I have a GPS and a camera in my car,
p114
aVI have a pretty precise idea of where I am
p115
aVand how fast I'm going.
p116
aVWith computer vision, I can estimate where
p117
aVthe cars around me are, sort of, and where they're going.
p118
aVAnd same with the other cars.
p119
aVThey can have a precise idea of where they are,
p120
aVand sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are.
p121
aVWhat happens if two cars share that data,
p122
aVif they talk to each other?
p123
aVI can tell you exactly what happens.
p124
aVBoth models improve.
p125
aVEverybody wins.
p126
aVProfessor Bob Wang and his team
p127
aVhave done computer simulations of what happens
p128
aVwhen fuzzy estimates combine, even in light traffic,
p129
aVwhen cars just share GPS data,
p130
aVand we've moved this research out of the computer simulation
p131
aVand into robot test beds that have the actual sensors
p132
aVthat are in cars now on these robots:
p133
aVstereo cameras, GPS,
p134
aVand the two-dimensional laser range finders
p135
aVthat are common in backup systems.
p136
aVWe also attach a discrete short-range communication radio,
p137
aVand the robots talk to each other.
p138
aVWhen these robots come at each other,
p139
aVthey track each other's position precisely,
p140
aVand they can avoid each other.
p141
aa(lp142
VWe're now adding more and more robots into the mix,
p143
aVand we encountered some problems.
p144
aVOne of the problems, when you get too much chatter,
p145
aVit's hard to process all the packets, so you have to prioritize,
p146
aVand that's where the predictive model helps you.
p147
aVIf your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories,
p148
aVyou don't pay as much attention to those packets.
p149
aVYou prioritize the one guy
p150
aVwho seems to be going a little off course.
p151
aVThat guy could be a problem.
p152
aVAnd you can predict the new trajectory.
p153
aVSo you don't only know that he's going off course, you know how.
p154
aVAnd you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd we wanted to do \u2014 how can we best alert everyone?
p157
aVHow can these cars whisper, "You need to get out of the way?"
p158
aVWell, it depends on two things:
p159
aVone, the ability of the car,
p160
aVand second the ability of the driver.
p161
aVIf one guy has a really great car,
p162
aVbut they're on their phone or, you know, doing something,
p163
aVthey're not probably in the best position
p164
aVto react in an emergency.
p165
aVSo we started a separate line of research
p166
aVdoing driver state modeling.
p167
aVAnd now, using a series of three cameras,
p168
aVwe can detect if a driver is looking forward,
p169
aVlooking away, looking down, on the phone,
p170
aVor having a cup of coffee.
p171
aVWe can predict the accident
p172
aVand we can predict who, which cars,
p173
aVare in the best position to move out of the way
p174
aVto calculate the safest route for everyone.
p175
aVFundamentally, these technologies exist today.
p176
aa(lp177
VI think the biggest problem that we face
p178
aVis our own willingness to share our data.
p179
aVI think it's a very disconcerting notion,
p180
aVthis idea that our cars will be watching us,
p181
aVtalking about us to other cars,
p182
aVthat we'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip.
p183
aVBut I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy,
p184
aVjust like right now, when I look at your car from the outside,
p185
aVI don't really know about you.
p186
aVIf I look at your license plate number,
p187
aVI don't really know who you are.
p188
aVI believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd I think it's going to be a great thing.
p193
aVI want you to consider for a moment
p194
aVif you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you
p195
aVto know that you're braking,
p196
aVthat you're coming to a dead stop.
p197
aVBy sharing our data willingly,
p198
aVwe can do what's best for everyone.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo let your car gossip about you.
p201
aVIt's going to make the roads a lot safer.
p202
aa(lp203
VThank you.

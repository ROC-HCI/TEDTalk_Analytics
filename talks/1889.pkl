VSo how many of you have ever been in a cave before?
p5
aVOkay, a few of you.
p6
aVWhen you think of a cave, most of you think
p7
aVof a tunnel going through solid rock,
p8
aVand in fact, that's how most caves are.
p9
aVAround this half of the country,
p10
aVmost of your caves are made of limestone.
p11
aVBack where I'm from, most of our  caves are made of lava rock,
p12
aVbecause we have a lot of volcanoes out there.
p13
aVBut the caves I want to share  with you today are made
p14
aVcompletely of ice, specifically glacier ice
p15
aVthat's formed in the side of the tallest mountain
p16
aVin the state of Oregon, called Mount Hood.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow Mount Hood's only  one hour's drive from Portland,
p19
aVthe largest city in Oregon,
p20
aVwhere over two million people live.
p21
aVNow the most exciting thing for a cave explorer
p22
aVis to find a new cave
p23
aVand be the first human to ever go into it.
p24
aVThe second most exciting thing for a cave explorer
p25
aVis to be the first one to make a map of a cave.
p26
aVNow these days, with so many people hiking around,
p27
aVit's pretty hard to find a new cave,
p28
aVso you can imagine how excited we were
p29
aVto find three new caves
p30
aVwithin sight of Oregon's largest city
p31
aVand realize that they had never been explored
p32
aVor mapped before.
p33
aVIt was kind of like being an astronaut,
p34
aVbecause we were getting to see things and go places
p35
aVthat no one had ever seen or gone to before.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo what is a glacier?
p38
aVWell, those of you who have ever seen or touched snow,
p39
aVyou know that it's really light,
p40
aVbecause it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together, and it's mostly air.
p41
aVIf you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball,
p42
aVit gets really small, hard and dense.
p43
aVWell, on a mountain like Hood, where it snows
p44
aVover 20 feet a year,
p45
aVit crushes the air out of it
p46
aVand gradually forms it into hard blue ice.
p47
aVNow each year, more and more ice stacks up on top of it,
p48
aVand eventually it gets so heavy
p49
aVthat it starts to slide down the mountain
p50
aVunder its own weight,
p51
aVforming a slow-moving river of ice.
p52
aVWhen ice packed like that starts to move,
p53
aVwe call it a glacier, and we give it a name.
p54
aVThe name of the glacier these caves are formed in
p55
aVis the Sandy Glacier.
p56
aVNow each year, as new snow lands on the glacier,
p57
aVit melts in the summer sun,
p58
aVand it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice,
p59
aVand they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier,
p60
aVforming big networks of caves,
p61
aVsometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock.
p62
aVNow the crazy thing about glacier caves
p63
aVis that each year, new tunnels form.
p64
aVDifferent waterfalls pop up or move around
p65
aVfrom place to place inside the cave.
p66
aVWarm water from the top of the ice
p67
aVis boring its way down,
p68
aVand warm air from below the mountain
p69
aVactually rises up, gets into the cave,
p70
aVand melts the ceilings back taller and taller.
p71
aVBut the weirdest thing about glacier caves
p72
aVis that the entire cave is moving,
p73
aVbecause it's formed inside a block of ice
p74
aVthe size of a small city
p75
aVthat's slowly sliding down the mountain.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow this is Brent McGregor,
p78
aVmy cave exploration partner.
p79
aVHe and I have both been exploring caves a long time
p80
aVand we've been climbing mountains a long time,
p81
aVbut neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before.
p82
aVBack in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video
p83
aVof a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves.
p84
aVThere were no GPS coordinates for it,
p85
aVand all we knew was that it was somewhere
p86
aVout on the Sandy Glacier.
p87
aVSo in July of that year, we went out on the glacier,
p88
aVand we found a big crack in the ice.
p89
aVWe had to build snow and ice anchors
p90
aVso that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole.
p91
aVThis is me looking into the entrance crevasse.
p92
aVAt the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel
p93
aVgoing right up the mountain
p94
aVunderneath thousands of tons of glacier ice.
p95
aVWe followed this cave back for about a half mile
p96
aVuntil it came to an end,
p97
aVand then with the help of our survey tools
p98
aVwe made a three-dimensional map of the cave
p99
aVon our way back out.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo how do you map a cave?
p102
aVWell, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps
p103
aVbecause they have pits and holes  going to overlapping levels.
p104
aVTo make a cave map, you have to set up
p105
aVsurvey stations every few feet inside the cave,
p106
aVand you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations.
p107
aVThen you use a compass and an inclinometer
p108
aVto measure the direction the cave is headed
p109
aVand measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings.
p110
aVNow those of you taking trigonometry,
p111
aVthat particular type of math is very useful
p112
aVfor making maps like this
p113
aVbecause it allows you to measure heights and distances
p114
aVwithout actually having to go there.
p115
aVIn fact, the more I mapped and studied caves,
p116
aVthe more useful I found all that math
p117
aVthat I originally hated in school to be.
p118
aVSo when you're done surveying,
p119
aVyou take all this data and you punch it into a computer
p120
aVand you find someone that can draw really well,
p121
aVand you have them draft up a map
p122
aVthat looks something like this,
p123
aVand it'll show you both a bird's-eye view of the passage
p124
aVas well as a profile view of the passage,
p125
aVkind of like an ant farm view.
p126
aVWe named this cave Snow Dragon Cave
p127
aVbecause it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow.
p128
aVNow later this summer, as more snow melted off the glacier,
p129
aVwe found more caves, and we realized they were all connected.
p130
aa(lp131
VNot long after we mapped Snow Dragon,
p132
aVBrent discovered this new cave not very far away.
p133
aVThe inside of it was coated with ice,
p134
aVso we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons
p135
aVso we could walk around without slipping.
p136
aVThis cave was amazing.
p137
aVThe ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green
p138
aVbecause the sunlight from far above
p139
aVwas shining through the ice and lighting it all up.
p140
aVAnd we couldn't understand why this cave
p141
aVwas so much colder than Snow Dragon
p142
aVuntil we got to the end and we found out why.
p143
aVThere was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin
p144
aVgoing 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier.
p145
aVCold air from the top of the mountain
p146
aVwas flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave,
p147
aVfreezing everything inside of it.
p148
aVAnd we were so excited about finding this new pit,
p149
aVwe actually came back in January the following year
p150
aVso we could be the first ones to explore it.
p151
aVIt was so cold outside,
p152
aVwe actually had to sleep inside the cave.
p153
aVThere's our camp on the left side  of this entrance room.
p154
aVThe next morning, we climbed out of the cave
p155
aVand hiked all the way to the top of the glacier,
p156
aVwhere we finally rigged and rappelled this pit
p157
aVfor the very first time.
p158
aVBrent named this cave Pure Imagination,
p159
aVI think because the beautiful sights we saw in there
p160
aVwere beyond what we could have ever imagined.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo besides really cool ice, what else is inside these caves?
p163
aVWell not too much lives in them  because they're so cold
p164
aVand the entrance is actually covered up with snow
p165
aVfor about eight months of the year.
p166
aVBut there are some really cool things in there.
p167
aVThere's weird bacteria living in the water
p168
aVthat actually eat and digest rocks
p169
aVto make their own food
p170
aVto live under this ice.
p171
aVIn fact, this past summer, scientists collected
p172
aVsamples of water and ice
p173
aVspecifically to see if things called extremophiles,
p174
aVtiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions,
p175
aVmight be living under the ice,
p176
aVkind of like what they hope to find on the polar icecaps of Mars someday.
p177
aVAnother really cool things is that,
p178
aVas seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die,
p179
aVthey get buried in the snow
p180
aVand gradually become part of the glacier,
p181
aVsinking deeper and deeper into the ice.
p182
aVAs these caves form and melt  their way up into the ice,
p183
aVthey make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling
p184
aVand fall onto the cave floor, where we end up finding them.
p185
aVFor example, this is a noble fir seed we found.
p186
aVIt's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years,
p187
aVand it's just now starting to sprout.
p188
aVThis mallard duck feather
p189
aVwas found over 1,800 feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave.
p190
aVThis duck died on the surface of the glacier long, long ago,
p191
aVand its feathers have finally made it down through over 100 feet of ice
p192
aVbefore falling inside the cave.
p193
aVAnd this beautiful quartz crystal
p194
aVwas also found in the back of Snow Dragon.
p195
aa(lp196
VEven now, Brent and I find it hard to believe
p197
aVthat all these discoveries were  essentially in our own backyard,
p198
aVhidden away, just waiting to be found.
p199
aVLike I said earlier, the idea of discovering
p200
aVin this busy world we live in
p201
aVkind of seems like something  you can only do with space travel now,
p202
aVbut that's not true.
p203
aVEvery year, new caves get discovered
p204
aVthat no one has ever been in before.
p205
aVSo it's actually not too late for one of you
p206
aVto become a discoverer yourself.
p207
aVYou just have to be willing to look
p208
aVand go where people don't often go
p209
aVand focus your eyes and your mind
p210
aVto recognize the discovery when you see it,
p211
aVbecause it might be in your own backyard.
p212
aa(lp213
VThank you very much.

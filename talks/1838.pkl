VThe work of a transportation commissioner
p5
aVisn't just about stop signs and traffic signals.
p6
aVIt involves the design of cities
p7
aVand the design of city streets.
p8
aVStreets are some of the most valuable resources
p9
aVthat a city has, and yet it's an asset
p10
aVthat's largely hidden in plain sight.
p11
aVAnd the lesson from New York
p12
aVover the past six years
p13
aVis that you can update this asset.
p14
aVYou can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively,
p15
aVit can provide immediate benefits,
p16
aVand it can be quite popular.
p17
aVYou just need to look at them a little differently.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is important because we live in an urban age.
p20
aVFor the first time in history,
p21
aVmost people live in cities,
p22
aVand the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years,
p23
aVthe population is going to double on the planet.
p24
aVSo the design of cities is a key issue for our future.
p25
aVMayor Bloomberg recognized this
p26
aVwhen he launched PlaNYC in 2007.
p27
aVThe plan recognized that cities
p28
aVare in a global marketplace,
p29
aVand that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive
p30
aVand to attract the million more people
p31
aVthat are expected to move here,
p32
aVwe need to focus on the quality of life
p33
aVand the efficiency of our infrastructure.
p34
aa(lp35
VFor many cities, our streets have been
p36
aVin a kind of suspended animation for generations.
p37
aVThis is a picture of Times Square in the '50s,
p38
aVand despite all of the technological innovation,
p39
aVcultural changes, political changes,
p40
aVthis is Times Square in 2008.
p41
aVNot much has changed in those 50 years.
p42
aVSo we worked hard to refocus our agenda,
p43
aVto maximize efficient mobility,
p44
aVproviding more room for buses, more room for bikes,
p45
aVmore room for people to enjoy the city,
p46
aVand to make our streets as safe as they can be
p47
aVfor everybody that uses them.
p48
aa(lp49
VWe set out a clear action plan
p50
aVwith goals and benchmarks.
p51
aVHaving goals is important,
p52
aVbecause if you want to change and steer the ship
p53
aVof a big city in a new direction,
p54
aVyou need to know where you're going and why.
p55
aa(lp56
VThe design of a street can tell you everything
p57
aVabout what's expected on it.
p58
aVIn this case, it's expected that you shelter in place.
p59
aVThe design of this street is really
p60
aVto maximize the movement of cars
p61
aVmoving as quickly as possible
p62
aVfrom point A to point B,
p63
aVand it misses all the other ways
p64
aVthat a street is used.
p65
aa(lp66
VWhen we started out, we did some early surveys
p67
aVabout how our streets were used,
p68
aVand we found that New York City was largely
p69
aVa city without seats.
p70
aVPictures like this, people perched
p71
aVon a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVIt's not great for parents with kids.
p74
aVIt's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers.
p75
aVIt's probably not good for the fire hydrants.
p76
aVCertainly not good for the police department.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo we worked hard to change that balance,
p79
aVand probably the best example of our new approach
p80
aVis in Times Square.
p81
aVThree hundred and fifty thousand people a day
p82
aVwalk through Times Square,
p83
aVand people had tried for years to make changes.
p84
aVThey changed signals, they changed lanes,
p85
aVeverything they could do to make Times Square work better.
p86
aVIt was dangerous, hard to cross the street.
p87
aVIt was chaotic.
p88
aVAnd so, none of those approaches worked,
p89
aVso we took a different approach, a bigger approach,
p90
aVlooked at our street differently.
p91
aVAnd so we did a six-month pilot.
p92
aVWe closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street
p93
aVand created two and a half acres
p94
aVof new pedestrian space.
p95
aVAnd the temporary materials are an important part
p96
aVof the program, because we were able to show
p97
aVhow it worked.
p98
aVAnd I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know.
p99
aVSo it was all about the data.
p100
aVSo if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility,
p101
aVif it was safer, better for business, we would keep it,
p102
aVand if it didn't work, no harm, no foul,
p103
aVwe could put it back the way that it was,
p104
aVbecause these were temporary materials.
p105
aVAnd that was a very big part of the buy-in,
p106
aVmuch less anxiety when you think that something
p107
aVcan be put back.
p108
aVBut the results were overwhelming.
p109
aVTraffic moved better. It was much safer.
p110
aVFive new flagship stores opened.
p111
aVIt's been a total home run.
p112
aVTimes Square is now one of the top 10
p113
aVretail locations on the planet.
p114
aVAnd this is an important lesson,
p115
aVbecause it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game
p116
aVbetween moving traffic and creating public space.
p117
aa(lp118
VEvery project has its surprises,
p119
aVand one of the big surprises with Times Square
p120
aVwas how quickly people flocked to the space.
p121
aVWe put out the orange barrels,
p122
aVand people just materialized immediately into the street.
p123
aVIt was like a Star Trek episode, you know?
p124
aVThey weren't there before, and then zzzzzt!
p125
aVAll the people arrived.
p126
aVWhere they'd been, I don't know, but they were there.
p127
aVAnd this actually posed an immediate challenge for us,
p128
aVbecause the street furniture had not yet arrived.
p129
aVSo we went to a hardware store
p130
aVand bought hundreds of lawn chairs,
p131
aVand we put those lawn chairs out on the street.
p132
aVAnd the lawn chairs became the talk of the town.
p133
aVIt wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars.
p134
aVIt was about those lawn chairs.
p135
aV"What did you think about the lawn chairs?"
p136
aV"Do you like the color of the lawn chairs?"
p137
aVSo if you've got a big, controversial project,
p138
aVthink about lawn chairs.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VThis is the final design for Times Square,
p142
aVand it will create a level surface,
p143
aVsidewalk to sidewalk,
p144
aVbeautiful pavers that have studs in them
p145
aVto reflect the light from the billboards,
p146
aVcreating a great new energy on the street,
p147
aVand we think it's going to really create
p148
aVa great place, a new crossroads of the world
p149
aVthat is worthy of its name.
p150
aVAnd we will be cutting the ribbon on this,
p151
aVthe first phase, this December.
p152
aa(lp153
VWith all of our projects, our public space projects,
p154
aVwe work closely with local businesses
p155
aVand local merchant groups
p156
aVwho maintain the spaces, move the furniture,
p157
aVtake care of the plants.
p158
aVThis is in front of Macy's, and they were
p159
aVa big supporter of this new approach,
p160
aVbecause they understood that more people on foot
p161
aVis better for business.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd we've done these projects all across the city
p164
aVin all kinds of neighborhoods.
p165
aVThis is in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn,
p166
aVand you can see the short leg that was there,
p167
aVused for cars, that's not really needed.
p168
aVSo what we did is we painted over the street,
p169
aVput down epoxy gravel, and connected the triangle
p170
aVto the storefronts on Grand Avenue,
p171
aVcreated a great new public space,
p172
aVand it's been great for businesses
p173
aValong Grand Avenue.
p174
aVWe did the same thing in DUMBO, in Brooklyn,
p175
aVand this is one of our first projects that we did,
p176
aVand we took an underutilized,
p177
aVpretty dingy-looking parking lot
p178
aVand used some paint and planters
p179
aVto transform it over a weekend.
p180
aVAnd in the three years since we've implemented the project,
p181
aVretail sales have increased 172 percent.
p182
aVAnd that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood.
p183
aa(lp184
VWe've moved very, very quickly
p185
aVwith paint and temporary materials.
p186
aVInstead of waiting
p187
aVthrough years of planning studies
p188
aVand computer models to get something done,
p189
aVwe've done it with paint and temporary materials.
p190
aVAnd the proof is not in a computer model.
p191
aVIt is in the real-world performance of the street.
p192
aVYou can have fun with paint.
p193
aa(lp194
VAll told, we've created over 50 pedestrian plazas
p195
aVin all five boroughs across the city.
p196
aVWe've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes
p197
aVand turned them into new pedestrian space.
p198
aa(lp199
VI think one of the successes is in its emulation.
p200
aVYou're seeing this kind of approach,
p201
aVsince we've painted Times Square,
p202
aVyou've seen this approach in Boston, in Chicago,
p203
aVin San Francisco, in Mexico City,
p204
aVBuenos Aires, you name it.
p205
aVThis is actually in Los Angeles,
p206
aVand they actually copied even the green dots
p207
aVthat we had on the streets.
p208
aVBut I can't underscore enough
p209
aVhow much more quickly this enables you to move
p210
aVover traditional construction methods.
p211
aa(lp212
VWe also brought this quick-acting approach
p213
aVto our cycling program,
p214
aVand in six years turned cycling
p215
aVinto a real transportation option in New York.
p216
aVI think it's fair to say \u2014
p217
aV(Applause) \u2014
p218
aVit used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike,
p219
aVand now New York has become
p220
aVone of the cycling capitals in the United States.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd we moved quickly to create an interconnected
p223
aVnetwork of lanes.
p224
aVYou can see the map in 2007.
p225
aVThis is how it looked in 2013
p226
aVafter we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes.
p227
aVI love this because it looks so easy.
p228
aVYou just click it, and they're there.
p229
aVWe also brought new designs to the street.
p230
aVWe created the first parking-protected bike lane
p231
aVin the United States.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
VWe protected bikers by floating parking lanes,
p236
aVand it's been great.
p237
aVBike volumes have spiked.
p238
aVInjuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers,
p239
aVare all down 50 percent.
p240
aVAnd we've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes,
p241
aVand now you're seeing them pop up
p242
aVall over the country.
p243
aVAnd you can see here that this strategy has worked.
p244
aVThe blue line is the number of cyclists,
p245
aVsoaring.
p246
aVThe green line is the number of bike lanes.
p247
aVAnd the yellow line is the number of injuries,
p248
aVwhich has remained essentially flat.
p249
aVAfter this big expansion, you've seen
p250
aVno net increase in injuries,
p251
aVand so there is something to that axiom
p252
aVthat there is safety in numbers.
p253
aa(lp254
VNot everybody liked the new bike lanes,
p255
aVand there was a lawsuit and somewhat
p256
aVof a media frenzy a couple years ago.
p257
aVOne Brooklyn paper called this bike lane
p258
aVthat we have on Prospect Park West
p259
aV"the most contested piece of land
p260
aVoutside of the Gaza Strip."
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd this is what we had done.
p265
aVSo if you dig below the headlines, though,
p266
aVyou'll see that the people were far ahead of the press,
p267
aVfar ahead of the politicians.
p268
aVIn fact, I think most politicians would be happy
p269
aVto have those kind of poll numbers.
p270
aVSixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes.
p271
aa(lp272
VThis summer, we launched Citi Bike,
p273
aVthe largest bike share program in the United States,
p274
aVwith 6,000 bikes
p275
aVand 330 stations located next to one another.
p276
aVSince we've launched the program,
p277
aVthree million trips have been taken.
p278
aVPeople have ridden seven million miles.
p279
aVThat's 280 times around the globe.
p280
aVAnd so with this little blue key,
p281
aVyou can unlock the keys to the city
p282
aVand this brand new transportation option.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd daily usage just continues to soar.
p285
aVWhat has happened is the average daily ridership
p286
aVon the streets of New York is 36,000 people.
p287
aVThe high that we've had so far is 44,000 in August.
p288
aVYesterday, 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City.
p289
aVThe bikes are being used six times a day.
p290
aVAnd I think you also see it in the kinds of riders
p291
aVthat are on the streets.
p292
aVIn the past, it looked like the guy on the left,
p293
aVninja-clad bike messenger.
p294
aVAnd today, cyclists look
p295
aVlike New York City looks.
p296
aVIt's diverse \u2014 young, old, black, white,
p297
aVwomen, kids, all getting on a bike.
p298
aVIt's an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around.
p299
aVQuite radical.
p300
aa(lp301
VWe've also brought this approach to our buses,
p302
aVand New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America,
p303
aVthe slowest bus speeds.
p304
aVAs everybody knows,
p305
aVyou can walk across town faster
p306
aVthan you can take the bus.
p307
aVAnd so we focused on the most congested areas
p308
aVof New York City,
p309
aVbuilt out six bus rapid transit lines,
p310
aV57 miles of new speedy bus lanes.
p311
aVYou pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus.
p312
aVWe've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out
p313
aVbecause they get ticketed by a camera
p314
aVif they use that lane,
p315
aVand it's been a huge success.
p316
aa(lp317
VI think one of my very favorite moments
p318
aVas transportation commissioner was the day
p319
aVthat we launched Citi Bike,
p320
aVand I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue
p321
aVin my protected bike lane,
p322
aVand I looked over and I saw pedestrians
p323
aVstanding safely on the pedestrian islands,
p324
aVand the traffic was flowing,
p325
aVbirds were singing \u2014
p326
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p327
aVthe buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes.
p328
aVIt was just fantastic.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd this is how it looked six years ago.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd so, I think that the lesson that we have
p333
aVfrom New York is that it's possible
p334
aVto change your streets quickly,
p335
aVit's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits,
p336
aVand it can be quite popular.
p337
aVYou just need to reimagine your streets.
p338
aVThey're hidden in plain sight.
p339
aa(lp340
VThank you.

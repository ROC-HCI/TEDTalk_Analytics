VThis is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two.
p5
aVYou can tell by the power squat, I was a very confident boy \u2014
p6
aVand not without reason.
p7
aVI had a very charming routine at the time,
p8
aVwhich was to wait until late in the evening
p9
aVwhen my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work,
p10
aVdoing their crossword puzzles, watching television.
p11
aVI would run into the living room, jump up on the couch,
p12
aVrip the cushions off, throw them on the floor,
p13
aVscream at the top of my lungs and run out
p14
aVbecause I was the Incredible Hulk.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVObviously, you see the resemblance.
p17
aVAnd this routine went on for some time.
p18
aa(lp19
VWhen I was seven I went to summer camp.
p20
aVMy parents found it necessary for peace of mind.
p21
aVAnd at noon each day
p22
aVthe campers would go to a pond,
p23
aVwhere they had floating docks.
p24
aVYou could jump off the end into the deep end.
p25
aVI was born premature. I was always very small.
p26
aVMy left lung had collapsed when I was born.
p27
aVAnd I've always had buoyancy problems.
p28
aVSo water was something that scared me to begin with.
p29
aVBut I would go in on occasion.
p30
aVAnd on one particular day,
p31
aVthe campers were jumping through inner tubes,
p32
aVThey were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun.
p33
aVSo I dove through the inner tube,
p34
aVand the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles.
p35
aVAnd I tried to come up for air,
p36
aVand my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube.
p37
aVAnd I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die.
p38
aVA camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us.
p39
aVFrom that point onward I was terrified of swimming.
p40
aVThat is something that I did not get over.
p41
aVMy inability to swim has been
p42
aVone of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments.
p43
aVThat is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut there is a happy ending to this story.
p46
aVAt age 31 \u2014 that's my age now \u2014
p47
aVin August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming,
p48
aVand question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming.
p49
aVAnd went from swimming one lap \u2014
p50
aVso 20 yards \u2014 like a drowning monkey,
p51
aVat about 200 beats per minute heart rate \u2014
p52
aVI measured it \u2014
p53
aVto going to Montauk on Long Island,
p54
aVclose to where I grew up,
p55
aVand jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water,
p56
aVgetting out and feeling better than when I went in.
p57
aVAnd I came out,
p58
aVin my Speedos, European style,
p59
aVfeeling like the Incredible Hulk.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd that's what I want everyone in here to feel like,
p62
aVthe Incredible Hulk, at the end of this presentation.
p63
aVMore specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable
p64
aVof becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer,
p65
aVa world-class language learner,
p66
aVand a tango champion.
p67
aVAnd I would like to share my art.
p68
aVIf I have an art, it's deconstructing things
p69
aVthat really scare the living hell out of me.
p70
aVSo, moving onward.
p71
aa(lp72
VSwimming, first principles.
p73
aVFirst principles, this is very important.
p74
aVI find that the best results in life
p75
aVare often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions.
p76
aVAnd the turnaround in swimming came
p77
aVwhen a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" \u2014
p78
aVthis is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy \u2014
p79
aV"if you can complete a one kilometer open water race."
p80
aVSo the clock started ticking.
p81
aVI started seeking out triathletes
p82
aVbecause I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did.
p83
aVI tried kickboards.
p84
aVMy feet would slice through the water like razors,
p85
aVI wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized, staring at my feet.
p86
aVHand paddles, everything.
p87
aVEven did lessons with Olympians \u2014 nothing helped.
p88
aVAnd then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine,
p89
aVhad completed an Iron Man with 103 degree temperature,
p90
aVsaid, "I have the answer to your prayers."
p91
aVAnd he introduced me to
p92
aVthe work of a man named Terry Laughlin
p93
aVwho is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming.
p94
aVThat set me on the road to examining biomechanics.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo here are the new rules of swimming,
p97
aVif any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.
p98
aVThe first is, forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive.
p99
aVSo it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem.
p100
aVKicking harder doesn't solve the problem
p101
aVbecause the average swimmer only transfers about three percent
p102
aVof their energy expenditure into forward motion.
p103
aVThe problem is hydrodynamics.
p104
aVSo what you want to focus on instead
p105
aVis allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body,
p106
aVmuch like a small car behind a big car on the highway.
p107
aVAnd you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position.
p108
aVThe only way you can do that
p109
aVis to not swim on top of the water.
p110
aVThe body is denser than water. 95 percent of it would be,
p111
aVat least, submerged naturally.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo you end up, number three,
p114
aVnot swimming, in the case of freestyle,
p115
aVon your stomach, as many people think, reaching on top of the water.
p116
aVBut actually rotating from streamlined right
p117
aVto streamlined left,
p118
aVmaintaining that fuselage position as long as possible.
p119
aVSo let's look at some examples. This is Terry.
p120
aVAnd you can see that he's extending his right arm
p121
aVbelow his head and far in front.
p122
aVAnd so his entire body really is underwater.
p123
aVThe arm is extended below the head.
p124
aVThe head is held in line with the spine,
p125
aVso that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up \u2014
p126
aVvery important, especially for people with lower body fat.
p127
aVHere is an example of the stroke.
p128
aVSo you don't kick. But you do use a small flick.
p129
aVYou can see this is the left extension.
p130
aVThen you see his left leg.
p131
aVSmall flick, and the only purpose of that
p132
aVis to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.
p133
aVAnd the entry point for his right hand \u2014 notice this,
p134
aVhe's not reaching in front and catching the water.
p135
aVRather, he is entering the water
p136
aVat a 45-degree angle with his forearm,
p137
aVand then propelling himself by streamlining \u2014 very important.
p138
aVIncorrect, above, which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you.
p139
aVNot their fault, honestly.
p140
aVAnd I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment.
p141
aVBelow is what most swimmers
p142
aVwill find enables them to do what I did,
p143
aVwhich is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length
p144
aVto 11 strokes
p145
aVin two workouts with no coach, no video monitoring.
p146
aVAnd now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming.
p147
aVI'll be doing a swimming lesson later, for myself, if anyone wants to join me.
p148
aa(lp149
VLast thing, breathing. A problem a lot of us have, certainly, when you're swimming.
p150
aVIn freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is
p151
aVto turn with body roll,
p152
aVand just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water.
p153
aVAnd that will get you very far.
p154
aVThat's it. That's really all you need to know.
p155
aa(lp156
VLanguages. Material versus method.
p157
aVI, like many people, came to the conclusion
p158
aVthat I was terrible at languages.
p159
aVI suffered through Spanish for junior high, first year of high school,
p160
aVand the sum total of my knowledge
p161
aVwas pretty much, "Donde esta el bano?"
p162
aVAnd I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs.
p163
aVThen I transferred to a different school sophomore year, and
p164
aVI had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese.
p165
aVSo I thought why not punish myself? I'll do Japanese.
p166
aVSix months later I had the chance to go to Japan.
p167
aVMy teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.
p168
aVYou'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope.
p169
aVIt will be an amazing experience." My first overseas experience in fact.
p170
aVSo my parents encouraged me to do it. I left.
p171
aa(lp172
VI arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.
p173
aVI couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world.
p174
aVI met my host family. Things went quite well I think,
p175
aVall things considered.
p176
aVMy first evening, before my first day of school,
p177
aVI said to my mother, very politely,
p178
aV"Please wake me up at eight a.m."
p179
aVSo, (Japanese)
p180
aVBut I didn't say (Japanese). I said, (Japanese). Pretty close.
p181
aVBut I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m."
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVYou've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VI walked in to school.
p187
aVAnd a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper.
p188
aVI couldn't read any of it \u2014 hieroglyphics, it could have been \u2014
p189
aVbecause it was Kanji,
p190
aVChinese characters adapted into the Japanese language.
p191
aVAsked him what this said.
p192
aVAnd he goes, "Ahh, okay okay,
p193
aVeehto, World History, ehh, Calculus,
p194
aVTraditional Japanese." And so on.
p195
aVAnd so it came to me in waves.
p196
aVThere had been something lost in translation.
p197
aVThe Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes, per se.
p198
aVThey were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students \u2014
p199
aVthe other 4,999 students in the school, who were Japanese, besides the American.
p200
aVAnd that's pretty much my response.
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method.
p204
aVI tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya.
p205
aVI tried every possible book, every possible CD.
p206
aVNothing worked until I found this.
p207
aVThis is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather,
p208
aVor a poster of the 1,945 common-use characters
p209
aVas determined by the Ministry of Education in 1981.
p210
aVMany of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters,
p211
aVto facilitate literacy \u2014 some are required to.
p212
aVAnd this became my Holy Grail, my Rosetta Stone.
p213
aa(lp214
VAs soon as I focused on this material,
p215
aVI took off.
p216
aVI ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu, Asahi newspaper,
p217
aVabout six months later \u2014 so a total of 11 months later \u2014
p218
aVand went from Japanese I to Japanese VI.
p219
aVEnded up doing translation work at age 16 when I returned to the U.S.,
p220
aVand have continued to apply this material
p221
aVover method approach to close to a dozen languages now.
p222
aVSomeone who was terrible at languages,
p223
aVand at any given time, speak, read and write five or six.
p224
aVThis brings us to the point,
p225
aVwhich is, it's oftentimes what you do,
p226
aVnot how you do it, that is the determining factor.
p227
aVThis is the difference between being effective \u2014 doing the right things \u2014
p228
aVand being efficient \u2014 doing things well whether or not they're important.
p229
aa(lp230
VYou can also do this with grammar.
p231
aVI came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.
p232
aVHaving a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar,
p233
aVby translating these sentences into past, present, future,
p234
aVwill show you subject, object, verb,
p235
aVplacement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.
p236
aVFrom that point, you can then, if you want to,
p237
aVacquire multiple languages, alternate them so there is no interference.
p238
aVWe can talk about that if anyone in interested.
p239
aVAnd now I love languages.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit \u2014
p242
aVvery important.
p243
aVYou might look at me and say, "That guy must be a ballroom dancer."
p244
aVBut no, you'd be wrong
p245
aVbecause my body is very poorly designed for most things \u2014
p246
aVpretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps.
p247
aVI used to be much bigger, much more muscular.
p248
aVAnd so I ended up walking like this.
p249
aVI looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.
p250
aVNot very good for ballroom dancing.
p251
aa(lp252
VI found myself in Argentina in 2005,
p253
aVdecided to watch a tango class \u2014 had no intention of participating.
p254
aVWent in, paid my ten pesos,
p255
aVwalked up \u2014 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio.
p256
aVThe instructor says, "You are participating."
p257
aVImmediately: death sweat.
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aVFight-or-flight fear sweat, because I tried ballroom dancing in college \u2014
p260
aVstepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed.
p261
aVI was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing,
p262
aVthat it exploded in my face,
p263
aVnever to return to the ballroom dancing club.
p264
aVShe comes up, and this was her approach, the teacher.
p265
aV"Okay, come on, grab me."
p266
aVGorgeous assistant instructor.
p267
aVShe was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice.
p268
aVSo I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands.
p269
aVAnd she pulled back, threw down her arms,
p270
aVput them on her hips, turned around and yelled across the room,
p271
aV"This guy is built like a god-damned mountain of muscle,
p272
aVand he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman,"
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVwhich I found encouraging.
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aVEveryone burst into laughter. I was humiliated.
p277
aVShe came back. She goes, "Come on. I don't have all day."
p278
aVAs someone who wrestled since age eight, I proceeded to crush her,
p279
aV"Of Mice and Men" style.
p280
aVAnd she looked up and said,
p281
aV"Now that's better."
p282
aVSo I bought a month's worth of classes.
p283
aV(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd proceeded to look at \u2014
p286
aVI wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline \u2014
p287
aVParkinson's Law,
p288
aVthe perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it.
p289
aVSo I had a very short deadline for a competition.
p290
aVI got a female instructor first,
p291
aVto teach me the female role, the follow,
p292
aVbecause I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities
p293
aVthat the follow needed to develop, so I wouldn't have a repeat of college.
p294
aVAnd then I took an inventory of the characteristics,
p295
aValong with her, of the
p296
aVof the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships.
p297
aVI interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires.
p298
aVI compared the two lists,
p299
aVand what you find is that there is explicitly,
p300
aVexpertise they recommended, certain training methods.
p301
aVThen there were implicit commonalities
p302
aVthat none of them seemed to be practicing.
p303
aVNow the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside,
p304
aVI found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities.
p305
aVLong steps. So a lot of milongueros \u2014
p306
aVthe tango dancers will use very short steps.
p307
aVI found that longer steps were much more elegant.
p308
aVSo you can have \u2014
p309
aVand you can do it in a very small space in fact.
p310
aVSecondly, different types of pivots.
p311
aVThirdly, variation in tempo.
p312
aVThese seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete
p313
aVif I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years.
p314
aa(lp315
VThat photo is of the
p316
aVsemi-finals of the Buenos Aires championships, four months later.
p317
aVThen one month later, went to the world championships,
p318
aVmade it to the semi-final. And then set a world record, following that,
p319
aVtwo weeks later.
p320
aVI want you to see part of what I practiced.
p321
aVI'm going to jump forward here.
p322
aVThis is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead.
p323
aVHis name is Gabriel Misse.
p324
aVOne of the most elegant dancers of his generation,
p325
aVknown for his long steps, and his tempo changes
p326
aVand his pivots.
p327
aVAlicia, in her own right, very famous.
p328
aVSo I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.
p329
aVNow what I like about this video
p330
aVis it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together
p331
aVbecause of his lead. He had a strong lead.
p332
aVHe didn't lead with his chest, which requires you lean forward.
p333
aVI couldn't develop the attributes in my toes,
p334
aVthe strength in my feet, to do that.
p335
aVSo he uses a lead that focuses on
p336
aVhis shoulder girdle and his arm.
p337
aVSo he can lift the woman to break her, for example.
p338
aVThat's just one benefit of that.
p339
aVSo then we broke it down.
p340
aVThis would be an example of one pivot.
p341
aVThis is a back step pivot.
p342
aVThere are many different types.
p343
aVI have hundreds of hours of footage \u2014
p344
aVall categorized, much like George Carlin
p345
aVcategorized his comedy.
p346
aVSo using my arch-nemesis,
p347
aVSpanish, no less, to learn tango.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator.
p350
aVSometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.
p351
aVMore often than not it shows you exactly what you should do.
p352
aVAnd the best results that I've had in life,
p353
aVthe most enjoyable times, have all been from asking a simple question:
p354
aVwhat's the worst that can happen?
p355
aVEspecially with fears you gained when you were a child.
p356
aVTake the analytical frameworks,
p357
aVthe capabilities you have, apply them to old fears.
p358
aVApply them to very big dreams.
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd when I think of what I fear now, it's very simple.
p361
aVWhen I imagine my life,
p362
aVwhat my life would have been like
p363
aVwithout the educational opportunities that I had,
p364
aVit makes me wonder.
p365
aVI've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct
p366
aVthe American public school system,
p367
aVto either fix it or replace it.
p368
aVAnd have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far \u2014
p369
aVbuilt, I'd say, about a half dozen schools,
p370
aVmy readers, at this point.
p371
aVAnd if any of you are interested in that,
p372
aVI would love to speak with you.
p373
aVI know nothing. I'm a beginner.
p374
aVBut I ask a lot of questions, and I would love your advice.
p375
aVThank you very much.
p376
aV(Applause)

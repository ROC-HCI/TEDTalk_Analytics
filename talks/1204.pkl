VHumans in the developed world
p5
aVspend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors,
p6
aVwhere they breathe in and come into contact
p7
aVwith trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye:
p8
aVmicroorganisms.
p9
aVBuildings are complex ecosystems
p10
aVthat are an important source
p11
aVof microbes that are good for us,
p12
aVand some that are bad for us.
p13
aVWhat determines the types and distributions
p14
aVof microbes indoors?
p15
aVBuildings are colonized by airborne microbes
p16
aVthat enter through windows
p17
aVand through mechanical ventilation systems.
p18
aVAnd they are brought inside
p19
aVby humans and other creatures.
p20
aVThe fate of microbes indoors
p21
aVdepends on complex interactions
p22
aVwith humans,
p23
aVand with the human-built environment.
p24
aVAnd today, architects and biologists
p25
aVare working together
p26
aVto explore smart building design
p27
aVthat will create
p28
aVhealthy buildings for us.
p29
aa(lp30
VWe spend an extraordinary amount of time
p31
aVin buildings
p32
aVthat are extremely controlled environments,
p33
aVlike this building here \u2014
p34
aVenvironments that have mechanical ventilation systems
p35
aVthat include filtering,
p36
aVheating and air conditioning.
p37
aVGiven the amount of time that we spend indoors,
p38
aVit's important to understand
p39
aVhow this affects our health.
p40
aVAt the Biology and the Built Environment Center,
p41
aVwe carried out a study in a hospital
p42
aVwhere we sampled air
p43
aVand pulled the DNA
p44
aVout of microbes in the air.
p45
aVAnd we looked at three different types of rooms.
p46
aVWe looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated,
p47
aVwhich are the data points in the blue.
p48
aVWe looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated,
p49
aVwhere the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation
p50
aVin a wing of the building
p51
aVand pry open the windows
p52
aVthat were no longer operable,
p53
aVbut they made them operable for our study.
p54
aVAnd we also sampled the outdoor air.
p55
aa(lp56
VIf you look at the x-axis of this graph,
p57
aVyou'll see that what we commonly want to do \u2014
p58
aVwhich is keeping the outdoors out \u2014
p59
aVwe accomplished that with mechanical ventilation.
p60
aVSo if you look at the green data points,
p61
aVwhich is air that's outside,
p62
aVyou'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity,
p63
aVor variety of microbial types.
p64
aVBut if you look at the blue data points,
p65
aVwhich is mechanically ventilated air,
p66
aVit's not as diverse.
p67
aVBut being less diverse
p68
aVis not necessarily good for our health.
p69
aVIf you look at the y-axis of this graph,
p70
aVyou'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air,
p71
aVyou have a higher probability
p72
aVof encountering a potential pathogen,
p73
aVor germ,
p74
aVthan if you're outdoors.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo to understand why this was the case,
p77
aVwe took our data
p78
aVand put it into an ordination diagram,
p79
aVwhich is a statistical map
p80
aVthat tells you something
p81
aVabout how related the microbial communities are
p82
aVin the different samples.
p83
aVThe data points that are closer together
p84
aVhave microbial communities that are more similar
p85
aVthan data points that are far apart.
p86
aVAnd the first things that you can see from this graph
p87
aVis, if you look at the blue data points,
p88
aVwhich are the mechanically ventilated air,
p89
aVthey're not simply a subset of the green data points,
p90
aVwhich are the outdoor air.
p91
aa(lp92
VWhat we've found is that mechanically ventilated air
p93
aVlooks like humans.
p94
aVIt has microbes on it
p95
aVthat are commonly associated with our skin
p96
aVand with our mouth, our spit.
p97
aVAnd this is because
p98
aVwe're all constantly shedding microbes.
p99
aVSo all of you right now
p100
aVare sharing your microbes with one another.
p101
aVAnd when you're outdoors,
p102
aVthat type of air has microbes
p103
aVthat are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt.
p104
aa(lp105
VWhy does this matter?
p106
aVIt matters because the health care industry
p107
aVis the second most energy intensive industry
p108
aVin the United States.
p109
aVHospitals use two and a half times
p110
aVthe amount of energy as office buildings.
p111
aVAnd the model that we're working with
p112
aVin hospitals,
p113
aVand also with many, many different buildings,
p114
aVis to keep the outdoors out.
p115
aVAnd this model
p116
aVmay not necessarily be the best for our health.
p117
aVAnd given the extraordinary amount
p118
aVof nosocomial infections,
p119
aVor hospital-acquired infections,
p120
aVthis is a clue that it's a good time
p121
aVto reconsider our current practices.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo just as we manage national parks,
p124
aVwhere we promote the growth of some species
p125
aVand we inhibit the growth of others,
p126
aVwe're working towards thinking about buildings
p127
aVusing an ecosystem framework
p128
aVwhere we can promote the kinds of microbes
p129
aVthat we want to have indoors.
p130
aVI've heard somebody say
p131
aVthat you're as healthy as your gut.
p132
aVAnd for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt
p133
aVso they can promote a healthy gut flora.
p134
aVAnd what we ultimately want to do
p135
aVis to be able to use this concept
p136
aVto promote a healthy group
p137
aVof microorganisms inside.
p138
aa(lp139
VThank you.

VI have to say that I'm very glad to be here.
p5
aVI understand we have over 80 countries here,
p6
aVso that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak
p7
aVto all of these countries.
p8
aa(lp9
VIn each country, I'm sure you have this thing called
p10
aVthe parent-teacher conference.
p11
aVDo you know about the parent-teacher conference?
p12
aVNot the ones for your kids, but the one you had as a child,
p13
aVwhere your parents come to school and your teacher
p14
aVtalks to your parents, and it's a little bit awkward.
p15
aVWell, I remember in third grade, I had this moment
p16
aVwhere my father, who never takes off from work,
p17
aVhe's a classical blue collar, a working-class immigrant person,
p18
aVgoing to school to see his son, how he's doing,
p19
aVand the teacher said to him, he said, "You know,
p20
aVJohn is good at math and art."
p21
aVAnd he kind of nodded, you know?
p22
aVThe next day I saw him talking to a customer at our
p23
aVtofu store, and he said, "You know, John's good at math."
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd that always stuck with me all my life.
p27
aVWhy didn't Dad say art? Why wasn't it okay?
p28
aVWhy? It became a question my entire life, and
p29
aVthat's all right, because being good at math meant
p30
aVhe bought me a computer, and some of you remember
p31
aVthis computer, this was my first computer.
p32
aVWho had an Apple II? Apple II users, very cool. (Applause)
p33
aVAs you remember, the Apple II did nothing at all. (Laughter)
p34
aVYou'd plug it in, you'd type in it and green text would come out.
p35
aVIt would say you're wrong most of the time.
p36
aVThat was the computer we knew.
p37
aVThat computer is a computer that I learned about
p38
aVgoing to MIT, my father's dream. And at MIT, however,
p39
aVI learned about the computer at all levels,
p40
aVand after, I went to art school to get away from computers,
p41
aVand I began to think about the computer as more of
p42
aVa spiritual space of thinking.
p43
aVAnd I was influenced by performance art \u2014
p44
aVso this is 20 years ago. I made a computer out of people.
p45
aVIt was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment.
p46
aVI have a power manager, mouse driver, memory, etc.,
p47
aVand I built this in Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.
p48
aVIt's a room broken in two halves.
p49
aVI've turned the computer on,
p50
aVand these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk
p51
aVbuilt out of cardboard, and it's put into the computer.
p52
aVAnd the floppy disk drive person wears it. (Laughter)
p53
aVShe finds the first sector on the disk, and
p54
aVtakes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus.
p55
aVSo the bus diligently carries the data into the computer
p56
aVto the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc.,
p57
aVand it's an actual working computer. That's a bus, really. (Laughter)
p58
aVAnd it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver,
p59
aVwhere it's XY. (Laughter)
p60
aVIt looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually
p61
aVa very slow computer, and when I realized how slow
p62
aVthis computer was compared to how fast a computer is,
p63
aVit made me wonder about computers and technology in general.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd so I'm going to talk today about four things, really.
p66
aVThe first three things are about how I've been curious
p67
aVabout technology, design and art, and how they intersect,
p68
aVhow they overlap, and also a topic that I've taken on
p69
aVsince four years ago I became the President
p70
aVof Rhode Island School of Design: leadership.
p71
aVAnd I'll talk about how I've looked to combine
p72
aVthese four areas into a kind of a synthesis, a kind of experiment.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo starting from technology,
p75
aVtechnology is a wonderful thing.
p76
aVWhen that Apple II came out, it really could do nothing.
p77
aVIt could show text and
p78
aVafter we waited a bit, we had these things called images.
p79
aVRemember when images were first possible with a computer,
p80
aVthose gorgeous, full-color images?
p81
aVAnd then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.
p82
aVIt was incredible. You could listen to sound on the computer.
p83
aVAnd then movies, via CD-ROM. It was amazing.
p84
aVRemember that excitement?
p85
aVAnd then the browser appeared. The browser was great,
p86
aVbut the browser was very primitive, very narrow bandwidth.
p87
aVText first, then images, we waited,
p88
aVCD-quality sound over the Net,
p89
aVthen movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible.
p90
aVAnd then the mobile phone occurred,
p91
aVtext, images, audio, video. And now we have iPhone,
p92
aViPad, Android, with text, video, audio, etc.
p93
aVYou see this little pattern here?
p94
aVWe're kind of stuck in a loop, perhaps, and this sense
p95
aVof possibility from computing is something I've been
p96
aVquestioning for the last 10 or so years,
p97
aVand have looked to design, as we understand most things,
p98
aVand to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine.
p99
aVAnd I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson.
p100
aa(lp101
VDesigners talk about the relationship between form
p102
aVand content, content and form. Now what does that mean?
p103
aVWell, content is the word up there: fear.
p104
aVIt's a four-letter word. It's a kind of a bad feeling word, fear.
p105
aVFear is set in Light Helvetica, so it's not too stressful,
p106
aVand if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica,
p107
aVit's like, "Oh, fear, who cares?" Right? (Laughter)
p108
aVYou take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big,
p109
aVand like, whoa, that hurts. Fear.
p110
aVSo you can see how you change the scale, you change
p111
aVthe form. Content is the same, but you feel differently.
p112
aVYou change the typeface to, like, this typeface,
p113
aVand it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface,
p114
aVlike Captain Jack Sparrow typeface. Arr! Fear!
p115
aVLike, aww, that's not fearful. That's actually funny.
p116
aVOr fear like this, kind of a nightclub typeface. (Laughter)
p117
aVLike, we gotta go to Fear. (Laughter)
p118
aVIt's, like, amazing, right? (Laughter) (Applause)
p119
aVIt just changes the same content.
p120
aVOr you make it \u2014 The letters are separated apart,
p121
aVthey're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic,
p122
aVand you feel sorry for the letters, like, I feel the fear.
p123
aVYou feel for them.
p124
aVOr you change the typeface to something like this.
p125
aVIt's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant, Fear.
p126
aVI can never get in there. (Laughter)
p127
aVIt's just amazing, Fear. But that's form, content.
p128
aa(lp129
VIf you just change one letter in that content,
p130
aVyou get a much better word, much better content: free.
p131
aV"Free" is a great word. You can serve it almost any way.
p132
aVFree bold feels like Mandela free.
p133
aVIt's like, yes, I can be free.
p134
aVFree even light feels kind of like, ah, I can breathe in free.
p135
aVIt feels great. Or even free spread out,
p136
aVit's like, ah, I can breathe in free, so easily.
p137
aVAnd I can add in a blue gradient and a dove,
p138
aVand I have, like, Don Draper free. (Laughter)
p139
aVSo you see that \u2014 form, content, design, it works that way.
p140
aVIt's a powerful thing. It's like magic, almost,
p141
aVlike the magicians we've seen at TED. It's magic.
p142
aVDesign does that.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd I've been curious about how design and technology intersect,
p145
aVand I'm going to show you some old work I never really
p146
aVshow anymore, to give you a sense of what I used to do.
p147
aVSo \u2014 yeah.
p148
aVSo I made a lot of work in the '90s.
p149
aVThis was a square that responds to sound.
p150
aVPeople ask me why I made that. It's not clear. (Laughter)
p151
aVBut I thought it'd be neat for the square
p152
aVto respond to me, and my kids were small then,
p153
aVand my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah,"
p154
aVyou know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah." You know, like that.
p155
aVWe'd go to a computer store, and they'd do the same thing.
p156
aVAnd they'd say, "Daddy, why doesn't the computer respond to sound?"
p157
aVAnd it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound?
p158
aVSo I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd then I spent a lot of time in the space of
p161
aVinteractive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because
p162
aVmy students at MIT got so much better than myself,
p163
aVso I had to hang up my mouse.
p164
aVBut in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white,
p165
aVmonochrome, fully monochrome, all in integer mathematics.
p166
aVIt's called "Tap, Type, Write."
p167
aVIt's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter
p168
aVthat my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary.
p169
aVIt has 10 variations. (Typing noise)
p170
aV(Typing noise)
p171
aVThere's a shift.
p172
aVTen variations. This is, like, spin the letter around.
p173
aV(Typing noises)
p174
aVThis is, like, a ring of letters. (Typing noises)
p175
aVThis is 20 years old, so it's kind of a \u2014
p176
aVLet's see, this is \u2014
p177
aVI love the French film "The Red Balloon."
p178
aVGreat movie, right? I love that movie. So,
p179
aVthis is sort of like a play on that. (Typing noises) (Typewriter bell)
p180
aVIt's peaceful, like that. (Laughter)
p181
aVI'll show this last one. This is about balance, you know.
p182
aVIt's kind of stressful typing out, so if you
p183
aVtype on this keyboard, you can, like, balance it out.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aVIf you hit G, life's okay, so I always say,
p186
aV"Hit G, and it's going to be all right.
p187
aVThank you. (Applause)
p188
aVThank you.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo that was 20 years ago, and
p191
aVI was always on the periphery of art.
p192
aVBy being President of RISD I've gone deep into art,
p193
aVand art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.
p194
aVYou know, when people say, "I don't get art.
p195
aVI don't get it at all." That means art is working, you know?
p196
aVIt's like, art is supposed to be enigmatic, so when you say,
p197
aVlike, "I don't get it," like, oh, that's great. (Laughter)
p198
aVArt does that, because art is about asking questions,
p199
aVquestions that may not be answerable.
p200
aa(lp201
VAt RISD, we have this amazing facility called
p202
aVthe Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples
p203
aVof animal, bone, mineral, plants.
p204
aVYou know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road,
p205
aVthey call us up and we pick it up and stuff it.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd why do we have this facility?
p208
aVBecause at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal,
p209
aVthe object, to understand its volume, to perceive it.
p210
aVAt RISD, you're not allowed to draw from an image.
p211
aVAnd many people ask me, John, couldn't you just
p212
aVdigitize all this? Make it all digital? Wouldn't it be better?
p213
aVAnd I often say, well, there's something good to how things
p214
aVused to be done. There's something very different about it,
p215
aVsomething we should figure out what is good about
p216
aVhow we did it, even in this new era.
p217
aVAnd I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named
p218
aVTota Hasegawa. He's based in London, no, actually it's in Tokyo,
p219
aVbut when he was based in London, he had a game
p220
aVwith his wife. He would go to antique shops,
p221
aVand the game was as such:
p222
aVWhen we look at an antique we want,
p223
aVwe'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique,
p224
aVand if it's a good story, we'll buy it.
p225
aVSo they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup,
p226
aVand they'd say, "Tell us about this cup."
p227
aVAnd the shopkeeper would say, "It's old." (Laughter)
p228
aV"Tell us more." "Oh, it's really old." (Laughter)
p229
aVAnd he saw, over and over, the antique's value
p230
aVwas all about it being old.
p231
aVAnd as a new media artist, he reflected, and said,
p232
aVyou know, I've spent my whole career making new media art.
p233
aVPeople say, "Wow, your art, what is it?" It's new media.
p234
aVAnd he realized, it isn't about old or new.
p235
aVIt's about something in between.
p236
aVIt isn't about "old," the dirt, "new," the cloud. It's about what is good.
p237
aVA combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at.
p238
aVYou see it in all interesting art today, in all
p239
aVinteresting businesses today. How we combine
p240
aVthose two together to make good is very interesting.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo art makes questions, and
p243
aVleadership is something that is asking a lot of questions.
p244
aVWe aren't functioning so easily anymore.
p245
aVWe aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore.
p246
aVAs an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time
p247
aVtraveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument,
p248
aVand I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass,"
p249
aVand I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English,
p250
aVand you're trying to single me out. That's not fair.
p251
aVBut I found a sign for Russian-speaking people,
p252
aVand it was the best sign ever to say no.
p253
aVIt was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything."
p254
aVMy favorite ones are "no plants." Why would you bring a plant to a national monument? I'm not sure.
p255
aVAnd also "no love." (Laughter)
p256
aVSo that is authoritarianism.
p257
aVAnd what is that, structurally?
p258
aVIt's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run
p259
aVmany systems today, but as we know, it's been disrupted.
p260
aVIt is now a network instead of a perfect tree.
p261
aVIt's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd so today, leaders are faced
p264
aVwith how to lead differently, I believe.
p265
aVThis is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont
p266
aVon creative leadership. What can we learn
p267
aVfrom artists and designers for how to lead?
p268
aVBecause in many senses, a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes.
p269
aVSomeone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes.
p270
aVA traditional leader is always wanting to be right,
p271
aVwhereas a creative leader hopes to be right.
p272
aVAnd this frame is important today, in this complex,
p273
aVambiguous space, and artists and designers have a lot to teach us, I believe.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd I had a show in London recently where my friends
p276
aVinvited me to come to London for four days
p277
aVto sit in a sandbox, and I said great.
p278
aVAnd so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight,
p279
aVsix hours every day, six-minute appointments with anyone in London,
p280
aVand that was really bad.
p281
aVBut I would listen to people, hear their issues,
p282
aVdraw in the sand, try to figure things out,
p283
aVand it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing.
p284
aVYou know? It's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days.
p285
aVAnd it felt kind of like being president, actually.
p286
aVI was like, "Oh, this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings, you know?"
p287
aVAnd by the end of the experience,
p288
aVI realized why I was doing this.
p289
aVIt's because leaders, what we do is we connect
p290
aVimprobable connections and hope something will happen,
p291
aVand in that room I found so many connections
p292
aVbetween people across all of London, and so leadership,
p293
aVconnecting people, is the great question today.
p294
aVWhether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy,
p295
aVit's a wonderful design challenge.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd one thing I've been doing is doing some research
p298
aVon systems that can combine technology and leadership
p299
aVwith an art and design perspective.
p300
aVLet me show you something I haven't shown anywhere, actually.
p301
aVSo what this is, is a kind of a sketch, an application sketch
p302
aVI wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop?
p303
aVThis is called Powershop, and the way it works is
p304
aVimagine an organization. You know, the CEO isn't ever
p305
aVat the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization.
p306
aVThere may be different subdivisions in the organization,
p307
aVand you might want to look into different areas. For instance,
p308
aVgreen are areas doing well, red are areas doing poorly.
p309
aVYou know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect,
p310
aVmake things happen? So for instance, you might open up
p311
aVa distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there,
p312
aVand know that you know someone in Eco, over here,
p313
aVand
p314
aVthese people here are in Eco, the people you might
p315
aVengage with as CEO, people going across the hierarchy.
p316
aVAnd part of the challenge of the CEO is to find
p317
aVconnections across areas, and so you might look in R&D,
p318
aVand here you see one person who crosses the two areas
p319
aVof interest, and it's a person important to engage.
p320
aVSo you might want to, for instance, get a heads-up display
p321
aVon how you're interacting with them.
p322
aVHow many coffees do you have?
p323
aVHow often are you calling them, emailing them?
p324
aVWhat is the tenor of their email? How is it working out?
p325
aVLeaders might be able to use these systems to
p326
aVbetter regulate how they work inside the heterarchy.
p327
aVYou can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso,
p328
aVthe guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep
p329
aVtext analysis. What is the tenor of your communications?
p330
aa(lp331
VSo these kind of systems, I believe, are important.
p332
aVThey're targeted social media systems around leaders.
p333
aVAnd I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin
p334
aVto grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design,
p335
aVbecause art and design lets you think like this,
p336
aVfind different systems like this,
p337
aVand I've just begun thinking like this,
p338
aVso I'm glad to share that with you.
p339
aVSo in closing, I want to thank all of you
p340
aVfor your attention. Thanks very much. (Applause)

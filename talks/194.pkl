VThank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here.
p5
aV(Laughter) We'll be talking about them.
p6
aVNow, I'm going try an experiment. I don't do experiments, normally. I'm a theorist.
p7
aVBut I'm going see what happens if I press this button.
p8
aVSure enough. OK. I used to work in this field of elementary particles.
p9
aVWhat happens to matter if you chop it up very fine?
p10
aVWhat is it made of?
p11
aVAnd the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe,
p12
aVand they're very much connected with the history of the universe.
p13
aa(lp14
VWe know a lot about four forces. There must be a lot more,
p15
aVbut those are at very, very small distances,
p16
aVand we haven't really interacted with them very much yet.
p17
aVThe main thing I want to talk about is this:
p18
aVthat we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics
p19
aVthat beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory.
p20
aVAnd why on earth could that be so?
p21
aa(lp22
VWell, here's an example from my own experience.
p23
aVIt's fairly dramatic, actually, to have this happen.
p24
aVThree or four of us, in 1957,
p25
aVput forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces, this weak force.
p26
aVAnd it was in disagreement with seven \u2014 seven, count them, seven experiments.
p27
aVExperiments were all wrong.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd we published before knowing that,
p30
aVbecause we figured it was so beautiful, it's gotta be right!
p31
aVThe experiments had to be wrong, and they were.
p32
aVNow our friend over there, Albert Einstein,
p33
aVused to pay very little attention when people said,
p34
aV"You know, there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity.
p35
aVDC Miller. What about that?" And he would say, "Aw, that'll go away." (Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, why does stuff like that work? That's the question.
p38
aVNow, yeah, what do we mean by beautiful? That's one thing.
p39
aVI'll try to make that clear \u2014 partially clear.
p40
aVWhy should it work, and is this something to do with human beings?
p41
aVI'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer,
p42
aVand that is, it has nothing to do with human beings.
p43
aVSomewhere in some other planet, orbiting some very distant star,
p44
aVmaybe in a another galaxy,
p45
aVthere could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are,
p46
aVand are interested in science. It's not impossible; I think there probably are lots.
p47
aa(lp48
VVery likely, none is close enough to interact with us.
p49
aVBut they could be out there, very easily.
p50
aVAnd suppose they have, you know, very different sensory apparatus, and so on.
p51
aVThey have seven tentacles, and they have 14 little funny-looking compound eyes,
p52
aVand a brain shaped like a pretzel.
p53
aVWould they really have different laws?
p54
aVThere are lots of people who believe that, and I think it is utter baloney.
p55
aVI think there are laws out there,
p56
aVand we of course don't understand them at any given time very well
p57
aV\u2014 but we try. And we try to get closer and closer.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd someday, we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory
p60
aVof the particles and forces, what I call the "fundamental law."
p61
aVWe may not even be terribly far from it.
p62
aVBut even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes,
p63
aVwe can still think there is one out there,
p64
aVand we're just trying to get closer and closer to it.
p65
aVI think that's the main point to be made.
p66
aVWe express these things mathematically.
p67
aVAnd when the mathematics is very simple \u2014
p68
aVwhen in terms of some mathematical notation,
p69
aVyou can write the theory in a very brief space, without a lot of complication \u2014
p70
aVthat's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance.
p71
aa(lp72
VHere's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there.
p73
aVNewton certainly believed that.
p74
aVAnd he said, here, "It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws."
p75
aVThe basic law, let's say \u2014 here's an assumption.
p76
aVThe assumption is that the basic law really takes the form
p77
aVof a unified theory of all the particles.
p78
aVNow, some people call that a theory of everything.
p79
aVThat's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical.
p80
aVAnd I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like, and so on.
p81
aVYou've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway. (Laughter)
p82
aVThere are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities.
p85
aVNow, sometimes those probabilities are near certainties.
p86
aVAnd in a lot of familiar cases, they of course are.
p87
aVBut other times they're not, and you have only probabilities for different outcomes.
p88
aVSo what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law.
p89
aVIt's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents,
p90
aVor chance outcomes, that are there in addition.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd the fundamental theory doesn't include those chance outcomes; they are in addition.
p93
aVSo it's not a theory of everything. And in fact, a huge amount of the information
p94
aVin the universe around us comes from those accidents,
p95
aVand not just from the fundamental laws.
p96
aVNow, it's often said that getting closer and closer
p97
aVto the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies, and then higher energies,
p98
aVand then higher energies, or short distances, and then shorter distances,
p99
aVand then still shorter distances, and so on, is like peeling the skin of an onion.
p100
aVAnd we keep doing that,
p101
aVand build more powerful machines, accelerators for particles.
p102
aVWe look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles,
p103
aVand in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, what happens is that as we do that, as we peel these skins of the onion,
p106
aVand we get closer and closer to the underlying law,
p107
aVwe see that each skin has something in common with the previous one,
p108
aVand with the next one. We write them out mathematically,
p109
aVand we see they use very similar mathematics.
p110
aVThey require very similar mathematics.
p111
aVThat is absolutely remarkable, and that is a central feature
p112
aVof what I'm trying to say today.
p113
aVNewton called it \u2014 that's Newton, by the way \u2014 that one.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis one is Albert Einstein. Hi, Al! And anyway,
p116
aVhe said, "nature conformable to herself" \u2014 personifying nature as a female.
p117
aVAnd so what happens is that the new phenomena,
p118
aVthe new skins, the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion
p119
aVthat we get to, resemble the slightly larger ones.
p120
aVAnd the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin
p121
aVis almost the same as what we need for the next skin.
p122
aVAnd that's why the equations look so simple.
p123
aVBecause they use mathematics we already have.
p124
aa(lp125
VA trivial example is this: Newton found the law of gravity,
p126
aVwhich goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated.
p127
aVCoulomb, in France, found the same law for electric charges.
p128
aVHere's an example of this similarity.
p129
aVYou look at gravity, you see a certain law.
p130
aVThen you look at electricity. Sure enough. The same rule.
p131
aVIt's a very simple example.
p132
aVThere are lots of more sophisticated examples.
p133
aVSymmetry is very important in this discussion.
p134
aVYou know what it means. A circle, for example,
p135
aVis symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle.
p136
aVYou rotate around the center of the circle, the circle remains unchanged.
p137
aVYou take a sphere, in three dimensions, you rotate around the center of the sphere,
p138
aVand all those rotations leave the sphere alone.
p139
aVThey are symmetries of the sphere.
p140
aVSo we say, in general, that there's a symmetry
p141
aVunder certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon,
p142
aVor its description, unchanged.
p143
aa(lp144
VMaxwell's equations are of course symmetrical
p145
aVunder rotations of all of space.
p146
aVDoesn't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle,
p147
aVit doesn't leave the \u2014 doesn't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism.
p148
aVThere's a new notation in the 19th century that expressed this,
p149
aVand if you use that notation, the equations get a lot simpler.
p150
aVThen Einstein, with his special theory of relativity,
p151
aVlooked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations,
p152
aVwhich are called special relativity.
p153
aVAnd those symmetries, then, make the equations even shorter, and even prettier, therefore.
p154
aa(lp155
VLet's look. You don't have to know what these things mean, doesn't make any difference.
p156
aVBut you can just look at the form. (Laughter) You can look at the form.
p157
aVYou see above, at the top, a long list
p158
aVof equations with three components for the three directions of space: x, y and z.
p159
aVThen, using vector analysis, you use rotational symmetry, and you get this next set.
p160
aVThen you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set
p161
aVdown here, showing that symmetry exhibits better and better.
p162
aVThe more and more symmetry you have, the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe last two, the first equation says that electric charges and currents
p165
aVgive rise to all the electric and magnetic fields.
p166
aVThe next \u2014 second \u2014 equation says that there is no magnetism other than that.
p167
aVThe only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents.
p168
aVSomeday we may find some slight hole in that argument.
p169
aVBut for the moment, that's the case.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of.
p172
aVThey should have heard of it, but it's a little tricky to explain in technical detail,
p173
aVso I won't do it. I'll just mention it. (Laughter)
p174
aVBut Chen Ning Yang, called by us "Frank" Yang \u2014 (Laughter)
p175
aV\u2014 and Bob Mills put forward, 50 years ago,
p176
aVthis generalization of Maxwell's equations, with a new symmetry.
p177
aVA whole new symmetry.
p178
aVMathematics very similar, but there was a whole new symmetry.
p179
aVThey hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics
p180
aV\u2014 didn't. It didn't, by itself, contribute to particle physics.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut then some of us generalized it further. And then it did!
p183
aVAnd it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force.
p184
aVSo here we say, again, what we said before:
p185
aVthat each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins.
p186
aVSo the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one.
p187
aVAnd therefore it looks beautiful
p188
aVbecause we already know how to write it in a lovely, concise way.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo here are the themes. We believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities.
p191
aVSteps toward unification exhibit the simplicity.
p192
aVSymmetry exhibits the simplicity.
p193
aVAnd then there is self-similarity across the scales \u2014 in other words,
p194
aVfrom one skin of the onion to another one.
p195
aVProximate self-similarity. And that accounts for this phenomenon.
p196
aVThat will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory.
p197
aa(lp198
VHere's what Newton himself said:
p199
aV"Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self."
p200
aVOne thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today,
p201
aVbut in his day it wasn't taken for granted.
p202
aVThere's the story, which is not absolutely certain to be right, but a lot of people told it.
p203
aVFour sources told it. That when they had the plague in Cambridge,
p204
aVand he went down to his mother's farm \u2014 because the university was closed \u2014
p205
aVhe saw an apple fall from a tree, or on his head or something.
p206
aVAnd he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth
p207
aVcould be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon.
p208
aa(lp209
VThat was a big unification for those days, although today we take it for granted.
p210
aVIt's the same theory of gravity.
p211
aVSo he said that this principle of nature, consonance:
p212
aV"This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers,
p213
aVI forbore to describe it in that book,
p214
aVlest I should be accounted an extravagant freak ... "
p215
aVThat's what we all have to watch out for, (Laughter) especially at this meeting.
p216
aV" ... and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book."
p217
aa(lp218
VNow, who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind?
p219
aVThat the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground
p220
aVis the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around,
p221
aVand so on? Everybody knows that. It's a property of gravitation.
p222
aVIt's not something in the human mind. The human mind can, of course, appreciate it
p223
aVand enjoy it, use it, but it's not \u2014 it doesn't stem from the human mind.
p224
aVIt stems from the character of gravity.
p225
aVAnd that's true of all the things we're talking about.
p226
aVThey are properties of the fundamental law.
p227
aVThe fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another,
p228
aVand therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply
p229
aVthe phenomenon of the next skin.
p230
aa(lp231
VI say here that Newton did a lot of things that year:
p232
aVgravity, the laws of motion, the calculus, white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow.
p233
aVAnd he could have written quite an essay on "What I Did Over My Summer Vacation."
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVSo we don't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates.
p236
aVThey follow from the fundamental theory.
p237
aVThey are what we call emergent properties.
p238
aVYou don't need \u2014 you don't need something more to get something more.
p239
aVThat's what emergence means.
p240
aa(lp241
VLife can emerge from physics and chemistry, plus a lot of accidents.
p242
aVThe human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents,
p243
aVthe way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents.
p244
aVIt doesn't diminish the importance of these subjects
p245
aVto know that they follow from more fundamental things, plus accidents.
p246
aVThat's a general rule, and it's critically important to realize that.
p247
aVYou don't need something more in order to get something more.
p248
aVPeople keep asking that when they read my book, "The Quark and the Jaguar,"
p249
aVand they say, "Isn't there something more beyond what you have there?"
p250
aVPresumably, they mean something supernatural.
p251
aVAnyway, there isn't. (Laughter)
p252
aVYou don't need something more to explain something more.
p253
aVThank you very much. (Applause)

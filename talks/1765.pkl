VThis will not be a speech
p5
aVlike any one I have ever given.
p6
aVI will talk to you today about
p7
aVthe failure of leadership in global politics
p8
aVand in our globalizing economy.
p9
aVAnd I won't provide some feel-good, ready-made solutions.
p10
aVBut I will in the end urge you
p11
aVto rethink, actually take risks, and get involved
p12
aVin what I see as a global evolution
p13
aVof democracy.
p14
aa(lp15
VFailure of leadership.
p16
aVWhat is the failure of leadership today?
p17
aVAnd why is our democracy not working?
p18
aVWell, I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact
p19
aVthat we have taken you out of the process.
p20
aVSo let me, from my personal experiences,
p21
aVgive you an insight, so that you can step back
p22
aVand maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope
p23
aVwith the challenges of today and why politics
p24
aVis going down a blind alley.
p25
aa(lp26
VLet's start from the beginning.
p27
aVLet's start from democracy.
p28
aVWell, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks,
p29
aVit was a revelation, a discovery,
p30
aVthat we had the potential, together,
p31
aVto be masters of our own fate,
p32
aVto be able to examine, to learn, to imagine,
p33
aVand then to design a better life.
p34
aVAnd democracy was the political innovation
p35
aVwhich protected this freedom,
p36
aVbecause we were liberated from fear
p37
aVso that our minds in fact,
p38
aVwhether they be despots or dogmas,
p39
aVcould be the protagonists.
p40
aVDemocracy was the political innovation that allowed us
p41
aVto limit the power, whether it was of tyrants
p42
aVor of high priests,
p43
aVtheir natural tendency to maximize power and wealth.
p44
aa(lp45
VWell, I first began to understand this
p46
aVwhen I was 14 years old.
p47
aVI used to, to try to avoid homework,
p48
aVsneak down to the living room and listen to my parents
p49
aVand their friends debate heatedly.
p50
aVYou see, then Greece was
p51
aVunder control of a very powerful establishment
p52
aVwhich was strangling the country,
p53
aVand my father was heading a promising movement
p54
aVto reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece
p55
aVwhere freedom reigned and where, maybe,
p56
aVthe people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country.
p57
aa(lp58
VI used to join him in many of the campaigns,
p59
aVand you can see me here next to him.
p60
aVI'm the younger one there, to the side.
p61
aVYou may not recognize me because
p62
aVI used to part my hair differently there.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VSo in 1967, elections were coming,
p67
aVthings were going well in the campaign,
p68
aVthe house was electric.
p69
aVWe really could sense that there was going to be
p70
aVa major progressive change in Greece.
p71
aa(lp72
VThen one night, military trucks drive up to our house.
p73
aVSoldiers storm the door.
p74
aVThey find me up on the top terrace.
p75
aVA sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun,
p76
aVputs it to my head, and says,
p77
aV"Tell me where your father is or I will kill you."
p78
aVMy father, hiding nearby, reveals himself,
p79
aVand was summarily taken to prison.
p80
aa(lp81
VWell, we survived, but democracy did not.
p82
aVSeven brutal years of dictatorship
p83
aVwhich we spent in exile.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, today, our democracies are again
p86
aVfacing a moment of truth.
p87
aVLet me tell you a story.
p88
aVSunday evening,
p89
aVBrussels, April 2010.
p90
aVI'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union.
p91
aVI had just been elected prime minister,
p92
aVbut I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth
p93
aVthat our deficit was not 6 percent,
p94
aVas had been officially reported only a few days earlier
p95
aVbefore the elections by the previous government,
p96
aVbut actually 15.6 percent.
p97
aVBut the deficit was only the symptom
p98
aVof much deeper problems that Greece was facing,
p99
aVand I had been elected on a mandate, a mission, actually,
p100
aVto tackle these problems,
p101
aVwhether it was lack of transparency
p102
aVand accountability in governance,
p103
aVor whether it was a clientelistic state
p104
aVoffering favors to the powerful \u2014 tax avoidance
p105
aVabetted and aided by a global tax evasion system,
p106
aVpolitics and media captured by special interests.
p107
aVBut despite our electoral mandate,
p108
aVthe markets mistrusted us.
p109
aVOur borrowing costs were skyrocketing,
p110
aVand we were facing possible default.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo I went to Brussels on a mission
p113
aVto make the case for a united European response,
p114
aVone that would calm the markets and give us the time
p115
aVto make the necessary reforms.
p116
aVBut time we didn't get.
p117
aVPicture yourselves around the table in Brussels.
p118
aVNegotiations are difficult, the tensions are high,
p119
aVprogress is slow, and then, 10 minutes to 2,
p120
aVa prime minister shouts out,
p121
aV"We have to finish in 10 minutes."
p122
aa(lp123
VI said, "Why? These are important decisions.
p124
aVLet's deliberate a little bit longer."
p125
aa(lp126
VAnother prime minister comes in and says,
p127
aV"No, we have to have an agreement now,
p128
aVbecause in 10 minutes,
p129
aVthe markets are opening up in Japan,
p130
aVand there will be havoc in the global economy."
p131
aa(lp132
VWe quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes.
p133
aVThis time it was not the military,
p134
aVbut the markets, that put a gun to our collective heads.
p135
aVWhat followed were the most difficult decisions in my life,
p136
aVpainful to me, painful to my countrymen,
p137
aVimposing cuts, austerity,
p138
aVoften on those not to blame for the crisis.
p139
aVWith these sacrifices, Greece did avoid bankruptcy
p140
aVand the eurozone avoided a collapse.
p141
aa(lp142
VGreece, yes, triggered the Euro crisis,
p143
aVand some people blame me for pulling the trigger.
p144
aVBut I think today that most would agree
p145
aVthat Greece was only a symptom
p146
aVof much deeper structural problems in the eurozone,
p147
aVvulnerabilities in the wider global economic system,
p148
aVvulnerabilities of our democracies.
p149
aVOur democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail,
p150
aVor, more accurately, too big to control.
p151
aVOur democracies are weakened in the global economy
p152
aVwith players that can evade laws, evade taxes,
p153
aVevade environmental or labor standards.
p154
aVOur democracies are undermined
p155
aVby the growing inequality
p156
aVand the growing concentration of power and wealth,
p157
aVlobbies, corruption, the speed of the markets
p158
aVor simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster,
p159
aVhave constrained our democracies,
p160
aVand they have constrained our capacity
p161
aVto imagine and actually use the potential, your potential,
p162
aVin finding solutions.
p163
aa(lp164
VGreece, you see, was only a preview
p165
aVof what is in store for us all.
p166
aVI, overly optimistically, had hoped
p167
aVthat this crisis was an opportunity for Greece, for Europe,
p168
aVfor the world, to make radical democratic transformations
p169
aVin our institutions.
p170
aVInstead, I had a very humbling experience.
p171
aVIn Brussels, when we tried desperately again and again
p172
aVto find common solutions,
p173
aVI realized that not one, not one of us,
p174
aVhad ever dealt with a similar crisis.
p175
aVBut worse, we were trapped by our collective ignorance.
p176
aVWe were led by our fears.
p177
aVAnd our fears led to a blind faith
p178
aVin the orthodoxy of austerity.
p179
aVInstead of reaching out to the common
p180
aVor the collective wisdom in our societies,
p181
aVinvesting in it to find more creative solutions,
p182
aVwe reverted to political posturing.
p183
aVAnd then we were surprised when every
p184
aVad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis,
p185
aVand of course that made it very easy
p186
aVto look for a whipping boy
p187
aVfor our collective European failure,
p188
aVand of course that was Greece.
p189
aVThose profligate, idle, ouzo-swilling, Zorba-dancing Greeks,
p190
aVthey are the problem. Punish them!
p191
aVWell, a convenient but unfounded stereotype
p192
aVthat sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself.
p193
aa(lp194
VBut let me warn you, this is not just about Greece.
p195
aVThis could be the pattern
p196
aVthat leaders follow again and again
p197
aVwhen we deal with these complex, cross-border problems,
p198
aVwhether it's climate change, whether it's migration,
p199
aVwhether it's the financial system.
p200
aVThat is, abandoning our collective power
p201
aVto imagine our potential,
p202
aVfalling victims to our fears, our stereotypes, our dogmas,
p203
aVtaking our citizens out of the process
p204
aVrather than building the process around our citizens.
p205
aVAnd doing so will only test the faith
p206
aVof our citizens, of our peoples, even more
p207
aVin the democratic process.
p208
aa(lp209
VIt's no wonder that many political leaders,
p210
aVand I don't exclude myself,
p211
aVhave lost the trust of our people.
p212
aVWhen riot police have to protect parliaments,
p213
aVa scene which is increasingly common around the world,
p214
aVthen there's something deeply wrong with our democracies.
p215
aVThat's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people
p216
aVown and decide on the terms of the rescue package.
p217
aVMy European counterparts, some of them, at least,
p218
aVsaid, "You can't do this.
p219
aVThere will be havoc in the markets again."
p220
aVI said, "We need to, before we restore confidence in the markets,
p221
aVwe need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people."
p222
aa(lp223
VSince leaving office, I have had time to reflect.
p224
aVWe have weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe,
p225
aVbut we remain challenged.
p226
aVIf politics is the power to imagine and use our potential,
p227
aVwell then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece,
p228
aVand in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination
p229
aVif not a lack of compassion.
p230
aVSo far, we've thrown economics at the problem,
p231
aVactually mostly austerity,
p232
aVand certainly we could have designed alternatives,
p233
aVa different strategy, a green stimulus for green jobs,
p234
aVor mutualized debt, Eurobonds which would
p235
aVsupport countries in need from market pressures,
p236
aVthese would have been much more viable alternatives.
p237
aVYet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much
p238
aVone of economics as it is one of democracy.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo let's try something else.
p241
aVLet's see how we can bring people back to the process.
p242
aVLet's throw democracy at the problem.
p243
aVAgain, the Ancient Greeks, with all their shortcomings,
p244
aVbelieved in the wisdom of the crowd
p245
aVat their best moments. In people we trust.
p246
aVDemocracy could not work without the citizens
p247
aVdeliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities
p248
aVfor public affairs.
p249
aVAverage citizens often were chosen for citizen juries
p250
aVto decide on critical matters of the day.
p251
aVScience, theater, research, philosophy,
p252
aVgames of the mind and the body,
p253
aVthey were daily exercises.
p254
aVActually they were an education for participation,
p255
aVfor the potential, for growing the potential of our citizens.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots.
p258
aVYou see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens,
p259
aVthat term originated there.
p260
aV"Idiot" comes from the root "idio," oneself.
p261
aVA person who is self-centered, secluded, excluded,
p262
aVsomeone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs.
p263
aVAnd participation took place in the agora, the agora having two meanings,
p264
aVboth a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation.
p265
aVYou see, markets and politics then were one, unified,
p266
aVaccessible, transparent, because they gave power to the people.
p267
aVThey serve the demos, democracy.
p268
aVAbove government, above markets
p269
aVwas the direct rule of the people.
p270
aa(lp271
VToday we have globalized the markets
p272
aVbut we have not globalized our democratic institutions.
p273
aVSo our politicians are limited to local politics,
p274
aVwhile our citizens, even though they see a great potential,
p275
aVare prey to forces beyond their control.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora?
p278
aVHow do we democratize globalization?
p279
aVAnd I'm not talking about the necessary reforms
p280
aVof the United Nations or the G20.
p281
aVI'm talking about, how do we secure the space,
p282
aVthe demos, the platform of values,
p283
aVso that we can tap into all of your potential?
p284
aa(lp285
VWell, this is exactly where I think Europe fits in.
p286
aVEurope, despite its recent failures,
p287
aVis the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment.
p288
aVSo let's see if it can't be an experiment
p289
aVin global democracy, a new kind of democracy.
p290
aVLet's see if we can't design a European agora,
p291
aVnot simply for products and services,
p292
aVbut for our citizens, where they can work together,
p293
aVdeliberate, learn from each other,
p294
aVexchange between art and cultures,
p295
aVwhere they can come up with creative solutions.
p296
aVLet's imagine that European citizens
p297
aVactually have the power to vote directly
p298
aVfor a European president,
p299
aVor citizen juries chosen by lottery
p300
aVwhich can deliberate on critical and controversial issues,
p301
aVa European-wide referendum where our citizens,
p302
aVas the lawmakers, vote on future treaties.
p303
aVAnd here's an idea:
p304
aVWhy not have the first truly European citizens
p305
aVby giving our immigrants,
p306
aVnot Greek or German or Swedish citizenship,
p307
aVbut a European citizenship?
p308
aVAnd make sure we actually empower
p309
aVthe unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship
p310
aVwhere they can choose to study anywhere in Europe.
p311
aVWhere our common identity is democracy,
p312
aVwhere our education is through participation,
p313
aVand where participation builds trust
p314
aVand solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia.
p315
aVEurope of and by the people,
p316
aVa Europe, an experiment in deepening and widening
p317
aVdemocracy beyond borders.
p318
aa(lp319
VNow, some might accuse me of being naive,
p320
aVputting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people.
p321
aVWell, after decades in politics, I am also a pragmatist.
p322
aVBelieve me, I have been,
p323
aVI am, part of today's political system,
p324
aVand I know things must change.
p325
aVWe must revive politics as the power to imagine,
p326
aVreimagine, and redesign for a better world.
p327
aa(lp328
VBut I also know that this disruptive force of change
p329
aVwon't be driven by the politics of today.
p330
aVThe revival of democratic politics
p331
aVwill come from you, and I mean all of you.
p332
aVEveryone who participates in this global exchange of ideas,
p333
aVwhether it's here in this room
p334
aVor just outside this room
p335
aVor online or locally, where everybody lives,
p336
aVeveryone who stands up to injustice and inequality,
p337
aVeverybody who stands up to those who preach
p338
aVracism rather than empathy,
p339
aVdogma rather than critical thinking,
p340
aVtechnocracy rather than democracy,
p341
aVeveryone who stands up to the unchecked power,
p342
aVwhether it's authoritarian leaders,
p343
aVplutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens,
p344
aVor powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few.
p345
aa(lp346
VIt is in their interest that all of us are idiots.
p347
aVLet's not be.
p348
aa(lp349
VThank you.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Applause)
p352
aa(lp353
VBruno Giussani: You seem to describe a political leadership
p354
aVthat is kind of unprepared
p355
aVand a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets,
p356
aVand that scene in Brussels that you describe, to me,
p357
aVas a citizen, is terrifying.
p358
aVHelp us understand how you felt after the decision.
p359
aVIt was not a good decision, clearly,
p360
aVbut how do you feel after that, not as the prime minister,
p361
aVbut as George?
p362
aa(lp363
VGeorge Papandreou: Well, obviously there were constraints
p364
aVwhich didn't allow me or others to make
p365
aVthe types of decisions we would have wanted,
p366
aVand obviously I had hoped that we would have the time
p367
aVto make the reforms which would have dealt
p368
aVwith the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit
p369
aVwhich was the symptom of the problem.
p370
aVAnd that hurt. That hurt because that, first of all,
p371
aVhurt the younger generation, and not only,
p372
aVmany of them are demonstrating outside,
p373
aVbut I think this is one of our problems.
p374
aVWhen we face these crises, we have kept the potential,
p375
aVthe huge potential of our society out of this process,
p376
aVand we are closing in on ourselves in politics,
p377
aVand I think we need to change that, to really find
p378
aVnew participatory ways using the great capabilities
p379
aVthat now exist even in technology but not only in technology,
p380
aVthe minds that we have, and I think we can find solutions
p381
aVwhich are much better, but we have to be open.
p382
aa(lp383
VBG: You seem to suggest that the way forward
p384
aVis more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse
p385
aVright now in most European countries.
p386
aVIt's rather the other way \u2014 more closed borders
p387
aVand less cooperation and maybe even stepping out
p388
aVof some of the different parts of the European construction.
p389
aVHow do you reconcile that?
p390
aa(lp391
VGP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened
p392
aVduring this crisis is that we started a blame game.
p393
aVAnd the fundamental idea of Europe is that
p394
aVwe can cooperate beyond borders,
p395
aVgo beyond our conflicts and work together.
p396
aVAnd the paradox is that, because we have this blame game,
p397
aVwe have less the potential to convince our citizens
p398
aVthat we should work together,
p399
aVwhile now is the time when we really need
p400
aVto bring our powers together.
p401
aa(lp402
VNow, more Europe for me is not simply
p403
aVgiving more power to Brussels.
p404
aVIt is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe,
p405
aVthat is, really making Europe a project of the people.
p406
aVSo that, I think, would be a way to answer
p407
aVsome of the fears that we have in our society.
p408
aa(lp409
VBG: George, thank you for coming to TED.
p410
aa(lp411
VGP: Thank you very much.BG: Thank you.(Applause)

VThe substance of things unseen.
p5
aVCities, past and future.
p6
aVIn Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll
p7
aVand look in the looking glass that is New York City
p8
aVto try and see our true selves,
p9
aVor perhaps pass through to another world.
p10
aVOr, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald,
p11
aV"As the moon rose higher,
p12
aVthe inessential houses began to melt away
p13
aVuntil gradually I became aware of the old island
p14
aVhere that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes,
p15
aVa fresh green breast of the new world."
p16
aa(lp17
VMy colleagues and I have been working for 10 years
p18
aVto rediscover this lost world
p19
aVin a project we call The Mannahatta Project.
p20
aVWe're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen
p21
aVon the afternoon of September 12th, 1609,
p22
aVwhen he sailed into New York harbor.
p23
aVAnd I'd like to tell you the story in three acts,
p24
aVand if I have time still, an epilogue.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo, Act I: A Map Found.
p27
aVSo, I didn't grow up in New York.
p28
aVI grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,
p29
aVin the Red Rock Canyon.
p30
aVAnd from these early experiences as a child
p31
aVI learned to love landscapes.
p32
aVAnd so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies,
p33
aVI studied this emerging field of landscape ecology.
p34
aVLandscape ecology concerns itself
p35
aVwith how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs
p36
aVmake habitats for plants and animals.
p37
aVThis experience and this training
p38
aVlead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society,
p39
aVwhich works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world.
p40
aVAnd over the last decade,
p41
aVI traveled to over 40 countries
p42
aVto see jaguars and bears and elephants
p43
aVand tigers and rhinos.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City.
p46
aVAnd on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists,
p47
aVto the top of the Empire State Building,
p48
aVand I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems,
p49
aVand I'd wonder, "How does this landscape
p50
aVwork to make habitat for plants and animals?
p51
aVHow does it work to make habitat for animals like me?"
p52
aVI'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall,
p53
aVand wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them.
p54
aVI'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park
p55
aVcome up against the abrupt and sheer
p56
aVtopography of midtown Manhattan.
p57
aa(lp58
VI started reading about the history and the geography in New York City.
p59
aVI read that New York City was the first mega-city,
p60
aVa city of 10 million people or more, in 1950.
p61
aVI started seeing paintings like this.
p62
aVFor those of you who are from New York,
p63
aVthis is 125th street under the West Side Highway.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVIt was once a beach. And this painting
p66
aVhas John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock.
p67
aVAnd it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights
p68
aVto Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.
p69
aa(lp70
VOr this painting, from the 1740s, from Greenwich Village.
p71
aVThose are two students at King's College \u2014 later Columbia University \u2014
p72
aVsitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.
p73
aVAnd so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill,
p74
aVand I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree.
p75
aVWhat's that palm tree doing there?
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VSo, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map.
p79
aVAnd it's this map you see here.
p80
aVIt's held in a geographic information system
p81
aVwhich allows me to zoom in.
p82
aVThis map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution,
p83
aV170 years later, made by British military cartographers
p84
aVduring the occupation of New York City.
p85
aVAnd it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew.
p86
aVAnd it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd if I zoom in to lower Manhattan
p89
aVyou can see the extent of New York City as it was,
p90
aVright at the end of the American Revolution.
p91
aVHere's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway.
p92
aVAnd this is City Hall Park.
p93
aVSo the city basically extended to City Hall Park.
p94
aVAnd just beyond it you can see features
p95
aVthat have vanished, things that have disappeared.
p96
aVThis is the Collect Pond, which was the fresh water source for New York City
p97
aVfor its first 200 years,
p98
aVand for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that.
p99
aVYou can see the Lispenard Meadows
p100
aVdraining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now,
p101
aVand the beaches that come up from the Battery,
p102
aVall the way to 42nd St.
p103
aa(lp104
VThis map was made for military reasons.
p105
aVThey're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications
p106
aVthat they built.
p107
aVBut they're also mapping things of ecological interest,
p108
aValso military interest: the hills,
p109
aVthe marshes, the streams.
p110
aVThis is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water,
p111
aVwhich used to run its way through Greenwich Village.
p112
aVOr the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.
p113
aVOr Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house
p114
aVon Murray Hill, 200 years ago.
p115
aVHere is Times Square,
p116
aVthe two streams that came together to make a wetland
p117
aVin Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo I saw this remarkable map in a book.
p120
aVAnd I thought to myself, "You know, if I could georeference this map,
p121
aVif I could place this map in the grid of the city today,
p122
aVI could find these lost features
p123
aVof the city,
p124
aVin the block-by-block geography that people know,
p125
aVthe geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live,
p126
aVand where they like to eat."
p127
aVSo, after some work we were able to georeference it,
p128
aVwhich allows us to put the modern streets on the city,
p129
aVand the buildings, and the open spaces,
p130
aVso that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is.
p131
aVWe can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams,
p132
aVand see where they actually are in the geography of the city today.
p133
aVSo this is fun for finding where things are
p134
aVrelative to the old topography.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut I had another idea about this map.
p137
aVIf we take away the streets, and if we take away the buildings,
p138
aVand if we take away the open spaces,
p139
aVthen we could take this map.
p140
aVIf we pull off the 18th century features
p141
aVwe could drive it back in time.
p142
aVWe could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals:
p143
aVto the hills, to the streams,
p144
aVto the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches,
p145
aVthe basic aspects that make the ecological landscape.
p146
aa(lp147
VThen, if we added maps like the geology, the bedrock geology,
p148
aVand the surface geology, what the glaciers leave,
p149
aVif we make the soil map,
p150
aVwith the 17 soil classes,
p151
aVthat are defined by the National Conservation Service,
p152
aVif we make a digital elevation model
p153
aVof the topography that tells us how high the hills were,
p154
aVthen we can calculate the slopes.
p155
aVWe can calculate the aspect.
p156
aVWe can calculate the winter wind exposure \u2014
p157
aVso, which way the winter winds blow across the landscape.
p158
aVThe white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds.
p159
aa(lp160
VWe compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.
p161
aVAnd we built a probability map of where they might have been.
p162
aVSo, the red areas on this map indicate the places
p163
aVthat are best for human sustainability on Manhattan,
p164
aVplaces that are close to water,
p165
aVplaces that are near the harbor to fish,
p166
aVplaces protected from the winter winds.
p167
aVWe know that there was a Lenape settlement
p168
aVdown here by the Collect Pond.
p169
aVAnd we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture,
p170
aVthat they grew these beautiful gardens of corn, beans, and squash,
p171
aVthe "Three Sisters" garden.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo, we built a model that explains where those fields might have been.
p174
aVAnd the old fields, the successional fields that go.
p175
aVAnd we might think of these as abandoned.
p176
aVBut, in fact, they're grassland habitats
p177
aVfor grassland birds and plants.
p178
aVAnd they have become successional shrub lands,
p179
aVand these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities.
p180
aVAnd it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types.
p181
aVYou can think of these as neighborhoods,
p182
aVas distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood \u2014
p183
aVthat these are the forest and the wetlands
p184
aVand the marine communities, the beaches.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis,
p187
aVManhattan had more ecological communities
p188
aVper acre than Yosemite does,
p189
aVthan Yellowstone, than Amboseli.
p190
aVIt was really an extraordinary landscape
p191
aVthat was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.
p194
aVSo, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees,
p195
aVthe 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan,
p196
aVthe Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore,
p197
aVthe beavers on all the streams, the black bears,
p198
aVand the Native Americans, to study how they used
p199
aVand thought about their landscape.
p200
aVWe wanted to try and map these. And to do that what we did
p201
aVwas we mapped their habitat needs.
p202
aa(lp203
VWhere do they get their food?
p204
aVWhere do they get their water? Where do they get their shelter?
p205
aVWhere do they get their reproductive resources?
p206
aVTo an ecologist, the intersection of these is habitat,
p207
aVbut to most people, the intersection of these is their home.
p208
aVSo, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides
p209
aVthat maybe you have on your shelves,
p210
aVyou know, what beavers need is, "A slowly meandering stream
p211
aVwith aspen trees and alders and willows,
p212
aVnear the water." That's the best thing for a beaver.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo we just started making a list.
p215
aVHere is the beaver. And here is the stream,
p216
aVand the aspen and the alder and the willow.
p217
aVAs if these were the maps that we would need
p218
aVto predict where you would find the beaver.
p219
aVOr the bog turtle, needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places.
p220
aVOr the bobcat, needing rabbits and beavers and den sites.
p221
aVAnd rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be
p222
aVsomething that a bobcat needs.
p223
aVBut a beaver also needs things. And that having it
p224
aVon either side means that we can link it together,
p225
aVthat we can create the network
p226
aVof the habitat relationships for these species.
p227
aa(lp228
VMoreover, we realized that you can start out
p229
aVas being a beaver specialist,
p230
aVbut you can look up what an aspen needs.
p231
aVAn aspen needs fire and dry soils.
p232
aVAnd you can look at what a wet meadow needs.
p233
aVAnd it need beavers to create the wetlands,
p234
aVand maybe some other things.
p235
aVBut you can also talk about sunny places.
p236
aVSo, what does a sunny place need? Not habitat per se.
p237
aVBut what are the conditions that make it possible?
p238
aVOr fire. Or dry soils.
p239
aVAnd that you can put these on a grid that's 1,000 columns long
p240
aVacross the top and 1,000 rows down the other way.
p241
aVAnd then we can visualize this data like a network,
p242
aVlike a social network.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd this is the network of all the habitat relationships
p245
aVof all the plants and animals on Manhattan,
p246
aVand everything they needed,
p247
aVgoing back to the geology,
p248
aVgoing back to time and space at the very core of the web.
p249
aVWe call this the Muir Web. And if you zoom in on it it looks like this.
p250
aVEach point is a different species
p251
aVor a different stream or a different soil type.
p252
aVAnd those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together.
p253
aVThey are the connections that actually make nature resilient.
p254
aVAnd the structure of this is what makes nature work,
p255
aVseen with all its parts.
p256
aVWe call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist
p257
aVJohn Muir, who said, "When we try to pick out anything by itself,
p258
aVwe find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords
p259
aVthat cannot be broken, to everything in the universe."
p260
aa(lp261
VSo then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps.
p262
aVSo if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,
p263
aVand Lex and Third,
p264
aVmaybe there was a stream in that block.
p265
aVAnd these would be the kind of trees that might have been there,
p266
aVand the flowers and the lichens and the mosses,
p267
aVthe butterflies, the fish in the stream,
p268
aVthe birds in the trees.
p269
aVMaybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.
p270
aVAnd perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there.
p271
aVAnd then we took this data.
p272
aa(lp273
VYou can see this for yourself on our website.
p274
aVYou can zoom into any block on Manhattan,
p275
aVand see what might have been there 400 years ago.
p276
aVAnd we used it to try and reveal a landscape
p277
aVhere in Act III.
p278
aVWe used the tools they use in Hollywood
p279
aVto make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.
p282
aVSo we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography.
p283
aVWe'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters, and illuminate the landscape.
p284
aVWe would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities.
p285
aVAnd feed into that the map of the species.
p286
aVSo that we would actually take a photograph,
p287
aVflying above Times Square, looking toward the Hudson River,
p288
aVwaiting for Hudson to come.
p289
aVUsing this technology, we can make these
p290
aVfantastic georeferenced views.
p291
aVWe can basically take a picture out of any window
p292
aVon Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago.
p293
aa(lp294
VThis is the view from the East River, looking up Murray Hill
p295
aVat where the United Nations is today.
p296
aVThis is the view looking down the Hudson River,
p297
aVwith Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right,
p298
aVlooking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.
p299
aVThis is the view over Times Square,
p300
aVwith the beaver pond there, looking out toward the east.
p301
aVSo we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind.
p302
aVWe can see the fields that the Native Americans made.
p303
aVAnd we can see this in the geography of the city today.
p304
aVSo when you're watching "Law and Order," and the lawyers walk up the steps
p305
aVthey could have walked back down those steps
p306
aVof the New York Court House, right into the Collect Pond,
p307
aV400 years ago.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo these images are the work of my friend and colleague,
p310
aVMark Boyer, who is here in the audience today.
p311
aVAnd I'd just like, if you would give him a hand,
p312
aVto call out for his fine work.
p313
aV(Applause)
p314
aa(lp315
VThere is such power in bringing science and visualization together,
p316
aVthat we can create images like this,
p317
aVperhaps looking on either side of a looking glass.
p318
aVAnd even though I've only had a brief time to speak,
p319
aVI hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place.
p320
aVThe place that you see here on the left side
p321
aVwas interconnected. It was based on this diversity.
p322
aVIt had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.
p323
aa(lp324
VBut I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place
p325
aVon the right, which I quite do. I've come to love the city
p326
aVand its kind of diversity, and its resilience,
p327
aVand its dependence on density and how we're connected together.
p328
aVIn fact, that I see them as reflections of each other,
p329
aVmuch as Lewis Carroll did in "Through the Looking Glass."
p330
aVWe can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time,
p331
aVthat they really are the same place,
p332
aVthat there is no way that cities can escape from nature.
p333
aVAnd I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo if you'll allow me a brief epilogue, not about the past,
p336
aVbut about 400 years from now,
p337
aVwhat we're realizing is that
p338
aVcities are habitats for people,
p339
aVand need to supply what people need:
p340
aVa sense of home, food, water, shelter,
p341
aVreproductive resources, and a sense of meaning.
p342
aVThis is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity.
p343
aVAnd so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning,
p344
aVabout bringing meaning to our lives
p345
aVin all kinds of different ways, through technology,
p346
aVthrough art, through science,
p347
aVso much so that I think we focus so much on
p348
aVthat side of our lives, that we haven't given enough
p349
aVattention to the food and the water and the shelter,
p350
aVand what we need to raise the kids.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo, how can we envision the city of the future?
p353
aVWell, what if we go to Madison Square Park,
p354
aVand we imagine it without all the cars,
p355
aVand bicycles instead
p356
aVand large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains?
p357
aVWhat if we imagined the Upper East Side
p358
aVwith green roofs, and streams winding through the city,
p359
aVand windmills supplying the power we need?
p360
aVOr if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area,
p361
aVcurrently home to 12 million people,
p362
aVbut 12 million people in the future, perhaps living at the density of Manhattan,
p363
aVin only 36 percent of the area,
p364
aVwith the areas in between covered by farmland,
p365
aVcovered by wetlands,
p366
aVcovered by the marshes we need.
p367
aa(lp368
VThis is the kind of future I think we need,
p369
aVis a future that has the same diversity
p370
aVand abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,
p371
aVbut that learns from the sustainability of the past,
p372
aVof the ecology, the original ecology, of nature with all its parts.
p373
aVThank you very much.
p374
aV(Applause)

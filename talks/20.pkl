VI think I was supposed to talk about my new book,
p5
aVwhich is called "Blink,"
p6
aVand it's about snap judgments and first impressions.
p7
aVAnd it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VBut I was thinking about this,
p12
aVand I realized that although my new book makes me happy,
p13
aVand I think would make my mother happy,
p14
aVit's not really about happiness.
p15
aVSo I decided instead, I would talk about someone
p16
aVwho I think has done as much to make Americans happy
p17
aVas perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,
p18
aVa man who is a great personal hero of mine:
p19
aVsomeone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,
p20
aVwho is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce.
p21
aa(lp22
VHoward's about this high, and he's round,
p23
aVand he's in his 60s, and he has big huge glasses
p24
aVand thinning gray hair,
p25
aVand he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality,
p26
aVand he has a parrot, and he loves the opera,
p27
aVand he's a great aficionado of medieval history.
p28
aVAnd by profession, he's a psychophysicist.
p29
aVNow, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is,
p30
aValthough at some point in my life,
p31
aVI dated a girl for two years
p32
aVwho was getting her doctorate in psychophysics.
p33
aVWhich should tell you something about that relationship.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VAs far as I know, psychophysics is about measuring things.
p38
aVAnd Howard is very interested in measuring things.
p39
aVAnd he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard,
p40
aVand he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York.
p41
aVAnd one of his first clients was Pepsi.
p42
aVThis is many years ago, back in the early 70s.
p43
aVAnd Pepsi came to Howard and they said,
p44
aV"You know, there's this new thing called aspartame,
p45
aVand we would like to make Diet Pepsi.
p46
aVWe'd like you to figure out
p47
aVhow much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi
p48
aVin order to have the perfect drink."
p49
aVNow that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer,
p50
aVand that's what Howard thought.
p51
aVBecause Pepsi told him,
p52
aV"We're working with a band between eight and 12 percent.
p53
aVAnything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough;
p54
aVanything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet.
p55
aVWe want to know: what's the sweet spot between 8 and 12?"
p56
aVNow, if I gave you this problem to do, you would all say, it's very simple.
p57
aVWhat we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi,
p58
aVat every degree of sweetness \u2014 eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,
p59
aVall the way up to 12 \u2014
p60
aVand we try this out with thousands of people,
p61
aVand we plot the results on a curve,
p62
aVand we take the most popular concentration, right?
p63
aVReally simple.
p64
aa(lp65
VHoward does the experiment, and he gets the data back,
p66
aVand he plots it on a curve,
p67
aVand all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve.
p68
aVIn fact, the data doesn't make any sense.
p69
aVIt's a mess. It's all over the place.
p70
aVNow, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such,
p71
aVare not dismayed when the data comes back a mess.
p72
aVThey think, "Well, you know,
p73
aVfiguring out what people think about cola's not that easy."
p74
aV"You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way."
p75
aV"You know, let's just make an educated guess,"
p76
aVand they simply point and they go for 10 percent,
p77
aVright in the middle.
p78
aVHoward is not so easily placated.
p79
aVHoward is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards.
p80
aVAnd this was not good enough for him,
p81
aVand this question bedeviled him for years.
p82
aVAnd he would think it through and say, "What was wrong?
p83
aVWhy could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?"
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd one day, he was sitting in a diner in White Plains,
p86
aVabout to go trying to dream up some work for Nescafé.
p87
aVAnd suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him.
p88
aVAnd that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data,
p89
aVthey were asking the wrong question.
p90
aVThey were looking for the perfect Pepsi,
p91
aVand they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis.
p92
aVTrust me.
p93
aVThis was an enormous revelation.
p94
aVThis was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science.
p95
aVHoward immediately went on the road,
p96
aVand he would go to conferences around the country,
p97
aVand he would stand up and say,
p98
aV"You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi.
p99
aVYou're wrong.
p100
aVYou should be looking for the perfect Pepsis."
p101
aVAnd people would look at him blankly and say,
p102
aV"What are you talking about? Craziness."
p103
aVAnd they would say, "Move! Next!"
p104
aVTried to get business, nobody would hire him \u2014
p105
aVhe was obsessed, though,
p106
aVand he talked about it and talked about it.
p107
aVHoward loves the Yiddish expression
p108
aV"To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish."
p109
aVThis was his horseradish.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VHe was obsessed with it!
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd finally, he had a breakthrough.
p116
aVVlasic Pickles came to him,
p117
aVand they said, "Doctor Moskowitz, we want to make the perfect pickle."
p118
aVAnd he said,
p119
aV"There is no perfect pickle; there are only perfect pickles."
p120
aVAnd he came back to them and he said,
p121
aV"You don't just need to improve your regular;
p122
aVyou need to create zesty."
p123
aVAnd that's where we got zesty pickles.
p124
aVThen the next person came to him: Campbell's Soup.
p125
aVAnd this was even more important.
p126
aa(lp127
VIn fact, Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation.
p128
aVCampbell's made Prego,
p129
aVand Prego, in the early 80s, was struggling next to Ragù,
p130
aVwhich was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.
p131
aVIn the industry \u2014 I don't know whether you care about this,
p132
aVor how much time I have to go into this.
p133
aVBut it was, technically speaking \u2014 this is an aside \u2014
p134
aVPrego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù.
p135
aVThe quality of the tomato paste is much better;
p136
aVthe spice mix is far superior;
p137
aVit adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way.
p138
aVIn fact, they would do the famous bowl test
p139
aVback in the 70s with Ragù and Prego.
p140
aVYou'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right?
p141
aVAnd the Ragù would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top.
p142
aVThat's called "adherence."
p143
aVAnd, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence,
p144
aVand the quality of their tomato paste,
p145
aVPrego was struggling.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo they came to Howard, and they said, fix us.
p148
aVAnd Howard looked at their product line, and he said,
p149
aVwhat you have is a dead tomato society.
p150
aVSo he said, this is what I want to do.
p151
aVAnd he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen,
p152
aVand he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce.
p153
aVAnd he varied them according to every conceivable way
p154
aVthat you can vary tomato sauce:
p155
aVby sweetness, by level of garlic,
p156
aVby tomatoey-ness, by tartness, by sourness,
p157
aVby visible solids \u2014
p158
aVmy favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VEvery conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce,
p163
aVhe varied spaghetti sauce.
p164
aVAnd then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces,
p165
aVand he went on the road.
p166
aVHe went to New York, to Chicago,
p167
aVhe went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.
p168
aVAnd he brought in people by the truckload into big halls.
p169
aVAnd he sat them down for two hours,
p170
aVand over the course of that two hours, he gave them ten bowls.
p171
aVTen small bowls of pasta,
p172
aVwith a different spaghetti sauce on each one.
p173
aVAnd after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100,
p174
aVhow good they thought the spaghetti sauce was.
p175
aa(lp176
VAt the end of that process, after doing it for months and months,
p177
aVhe had a mountain of data
p178
aVabout how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce.
p179
aVAnd then he analyzed the data.
p180
aVDid he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce?
p181
aVNo! Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing.
p182
aVInstead, he looked at the data, and he said,
p183
aVlet's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters.
p184
aVLet's see if they congregate around certain ideas.
p185
aVAnd sure enough, if you sit down,
p186
aVand you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce,
p187
aVyou realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.
p188
aVThere are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain;
p189
aVthere are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;
p190
aVand there are people who like it extra chunky.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd of those three facts, the third one was the most significant,
p193
aVbecause at the time, in the early 1980s,
p194
aVif you went to a supermarket,
p195
aVyou would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.
p196
aVAnd Prego turned to Howard, and they said,
p197
aV"You're telling me that one third of Americans
p198
aVcrave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce
p199
aVand yet no one is servicing their needs?"
p200
aVAnd he said "Yes!"
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd Prego then went back,
p205
aVand completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce,
p206
aVand came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely
p207
aVtook over the spaghetti sauce business in this country.
p208
aVAnd over the next 10 years, they made 600 million dollars
p209
aVoff their line of extra-chunky sauces.
p210
aa(lp211
VEveryone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said,
p212
aV"Oh my god! We've been thinking all wrong!"
p213
aVAnd that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar,
p214
aVand 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil.
p215
aVAnd then eventually even Ragù hired Howard,
p216
aVand Howard did the exact same thing for Ragù that he did for Prego.
p217
aVAnd today, if you go to a really good supermarket,
p218
aVdo you know how many Ragùs there are?
p219
aV36!
p220
aVIn six varieties:
p221
aVCheese, Light,
p222
aVRobusto, Rich & Hearty,
p223
aVOld World Traditional \u2014
p224
aVExtra-Chunky Garden.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VThat's Howard's doing.
p229
aVThat is Howard's gift to the American people.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow why is that important?
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VIt is, in fact, enormously important.
p236
aVI'll explain to you why.
p237
aVWhat Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks
p238
aVabout making you happy.
p239
aVAssumption number one in the food industry used to be
p240
aVthat the way to find out what people want to eat,
p241
aVwhat will make people happy, is to ask them.
p242
aVAnd for years and years and years,
p243
aVRagù and Prego would have focus groups,
p244
aVand they would sit you down, and they would say,
p245
aV"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?
p246
aVTell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce."
p247
aVAnd for all those years \u2014 20, 30 years \u2014
p248
aVthrough all those focus group sessions,
p249
aVno one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.
p250
aVEven though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VPeople don't know what they want!
p255
aVAs Howard loves to say,
p256
aV"The mind knows not what the tongue wants."
p257
aVIt's a mystery!
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd a critically important step
p262
aVin understanding our own desires and tastes
p263
aVis to realize that we cannot always explain what we want, deep down.
p264
aVIf I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee,
p265
aVyou know what you'd say?
p266
aVEvery one of you would say, "I want a dark, rich, hearty roast."
p267
aVIt's what people always say when you ask them.
p268
aV"What do you like?" "Dark, rich, hearty roast!"
p269
aVWhat percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast?
p270
aVAccording to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you.
p271
aVMost of you like milky, weak coffee.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VBut you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want
p276
aVthat "I want a milky, weak coffee."
p277
aa(lp278
VSo that's number one thing that Howard did.
p279
aVNumber two thing that Howard did is he made us realize \u2014
p280
aVit's another very critical point \u2014
p281
aVhe made us realize the importance
p282
aVof what he likes to call "horizontal segmentation."
p283
aVWhy is this critical?
p284
aVBecause this is the way the food industry thought before Howard.
p285
aVWhat were they obsessed with in the early 80s?
p286
aVThey were obsessed with mustard.
p287
aVIn particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon.
p288
aVUsed to be, there were two mustards: French's and Gulden's.
p289
aVWhat were they? Yellow mustard.
p290
aVWhat's in it?
p291
aVYellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika.
p292
aVThat was mustard.
p293
aVGrey Poupon came along, with a Dijon.
p294
aVRight?
p295
aVMuch more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit,
p296
aVmuch more delicate aromatics.
p297
aVAnd what do they do?
p298
aVThey put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it,
p299
aVmade it look French,
p300
aVeven though it's made in Oxnard, California.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight-ounce bottle,
p305
aVthe way that French's and Gulden's did,
p306
aVthey decided to charge four dollars.
p307
aVAnd they had those ads.
p308
aVWith the guy in the Rolls Royce, eating the Grey Poupon.
p309
aVAnother pulls up, and says, "Do you have any Grey Poupon?"
p310
aVAnd the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off!
p311
aVTakes over the mustard business!
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd everyone's take-home lesson from that
p314
aVwas that the way to make people happy
p315
aVis to give them something that is more expensive,
p316
aVsomething to aspire to.
p317
aVIt's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now,
p318
aVand reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VA better mustard! A more expensive mustard!
p323
aVA mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning.
p324
aVAnd Howard looked to that and said, "That's wrong!"
p325
aVMustard does not exist on a hierarchy.
p326
aVMustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane.
p327
aVThere is no good mustard or bad mustard.
p328
aVThere is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard.
p329
aVThere are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people.
p330
aVHe fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste.
p331
aVAnd for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.
p332
aa(lp333
VThird thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important,
p334
aVis Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VWhat do I mean by that?
p339
aa(lp340
V(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VFor the longest time in the food industry,
p343
aVthere was a sense that there was one way,
p344
aVa perfect way, to make a dish.
p345
aVYou go to Chez Panisse,
p346
aVthey give you the red-tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds
p347
aVin a something something reduction.
p348
aVThey don't give you five options on the reduction.
p349
aVThey don't say, "Do you want the extra-chunky reduction, or ...?"
p350
aVNo!
p351
aVYou just get the reduction. Why?
p352
aVBecause the chef at Chez Panisse
p353
aVhas a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi.
p354
aV"This is the way it ought to be."
p355
aVAnd she serves it that way time and time again,
p356
aVand if you quarrel with her, she will say,
p357
aV"You know what? You're wrong!
p358
aVThis is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant."
p359
aa(lp360
VNow that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well.
p361
aVThey had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was.
p362
aVAnd where did that come from? It came from Italy.
p363
aVItalian tomato sauce is what?
p364
aVIt's blended; it's thin.
p365
aVThe culture of tomato sauce was thin.
p366
aVWhen we talked about "authentic tomato sauce" in the 1970s,
p367
aVwe talked about Italian tomato sauce,
p368
aVwe talked about the earliest Ragùs,
p369
aVwhich had no visible solids, right?
p370
aVWhich were thin, you just put a little bit
p371
aVand it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta.
p372
aVThat's what it was.
p373
aVAnd why were we attached to that?
p374
aVBecause we thought that what it took to make people happy
p375
aVwas to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A.
p376
aVAnd B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce,
p377
aVthen they would embrace it.
p378
aVAnd that's what would please the maximum number of people.
p379
aa(lp380
VIn other words,
p381
aVpeople in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals.
p382
aVThey were looking for one way to treat all of us.
p383
aVAnd it's good reason for them to be obsessed
p384
aVwith the idea of universals,
p385
aVbecause all of science,
p386
aVthrough the 19th century and much of the 20th,
p387
aVwas obsessed with universals.
p388
aVPsychologists, medical scientists, economists
p389
aVwere all interested in finding out the rules
p390
aVthat govern the way all of us behave.
p391
aVBut that changed, right?
p392
aVWhat is the great revolution in science of the last 10, 15 years?
p393
aVIt is the movement from the search for universals
p394
aVto the understanding of variability.
p395
aVNow in medical science, we don't want to know, necessarily,
p396
aVjust how cancer works,
p397
aVwe want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer.
p398
aVI guess my cancer different from your cancer.
p399
aVGenetics has opened the door to the study of human variability.
p400
aVWhat Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying,
p401
aV"This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce."
p402
aVAnd for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks.
p403
aa(lp404
VI'll give you one last illustration of variability,
p405
aVand that is \u2014 oh, I'm sorry.
p406
aVHoward not only believed that, but he took it a second step,
p407
aVwhich was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food,
p408
aVwe aren't just making an error;
p409
aVwe are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice.
p410
aVAnd the example he used was coffee.
p411
aVAnd coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafé.
p412
aVIf I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee \u2014
p413
aVa type of coffee, a brew \u2014 that made all of you happy,
p414
aVand then I asked you to rate that coffee,
p415
aVthe average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.
p416
aVIf, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters,
p417
aVmaybe three or four coffee clusters,
p418
aVand I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters,
p419
aVyour scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.
p420
aVThe difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78
p421
aVis a difference between coffee that makes you wince,
p422
aVand coffee that makes you deliriously happy.
p423
aa(lp424
VThat is the final, and I think most beautiful lesson,
p425
aVof Howard Moskowitz:
p426
aVthat in embracing the diversity of human beings,
p427
aVwe will find a surer way to true happiness.
p428
aa(lp429
VThank you.
p430
aa(lp431
V(Applause)

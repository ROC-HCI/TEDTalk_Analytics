VClimate change is already a heavy topic,
p5
aVand it's getting heavier
p6
aVbecause we're understanding
p7
aVthat we need to do more than we are.
p8
aVWe're understanding, in fact,
p9
aVthat those of us who live in the developed world
p10
aVneed to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.
p11
aVThat's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now.
p12
aVAnd it tends to feel a little overwhelming
p13
aVwhen we look at what is there in reality today
p14
aVand the magnitude of the problem that we face.
p15
aVAnd when we have overwhelming problems in front of us,
p16
aVwe tend to seek simple answers.
p17
aVAnd I think this is what we've done with climate change.
p18
aVWe look at where the emissions are coming from \u2014
p19
aVthey're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth,
p20
aVand we say, okay, well the problem is
p21
aVthat they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning,
p22
aVso therefore, the answer must be
p23
aVto replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy.
p24
aVAnd while, of course, we do need clean energy,
p25
aVI would put to you that it's possible
p26
aVthat by looking at climate change
p27
aVas a clean energy generation problem,
p28
aVwe're in fact setting ourselves up
p29
aVnot to solve it.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd the reason why
p32
aVis that we live on a planet
p33
aVthat is rapidly urbanizing.
p34
aVThat shouldn't be news to any of us.
p35
aVHowever, it's hard sometimes
p36
aVto remember the extent of that urbanization.
p37
aVBy mid-century,
p38
aVwe're going to have about eight billion \u2014 perhaps more \u2014 people
p39
aVliving in cities or within a day's travel of one.
p40
aVWe will be an overwhelmingly urban species.
p41
aVIn order to provide
p42
aVthe kind of energy that it would take
p43
aVfor eight billion people living in cities
p44
aVthat are even somewhat like the cities
p45
aVthat those of us in the global North live in today,
p46
aVwe would have to generate
p47
aVan absolutely astonishing amount of energy.
p48
aVIt may be possible
p49
aVthat we are not even able
p50
aVto build that much clean energy.
p51
aVSo if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change
p52
aVon an urbanizing planet,
p53
aVwe need to look somewhere else for the solution.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think,
p56
aVbecause all of those cities we're building
p57
aVare opportunities.
p58
aVEvery city determines to a very large extent
p59
aVthe amount of energy used by its inhabitants.
p60
aVWe tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing \u2014
p61
aVI choose to turn this light switch on \u2014
p62
aVbut really, enormous amounts of our energy use
p63
aVare predestined
p64
aVby the kinds of communities and cities that we live in.
p65
aVI won't show you very many graphs today,
p66
aVbut if I can just focus on this one for a moment,
p67
aVit really tells us a lot of what we need to know \u2014
p68
aVwhich is, quite simply,
p69
aVthat if you look, for example, at transportation,
p70
aVa major category of climate emissions,
p71
aVthere is a direct relationship
p72
aVbetween how dense a city is
p73
aVand the amount of climate emissions
p74
aVthat its residents spew out into the air.
p75
aVAnd the correlation, of course,
p76
aVis that denser places tend to have lower emissions \u2014
p77
aVwhich isn't really all that difficult to figure out, if you think about it.
p78
aa(lp79
VBasically,
p80
aVwe substitute, in our lives,
p81
aVaccess to the things we want.
p82
aVWe go out there and we hop in our cars
p83
aVand we drive from place to place.
p84
aVAnd we're basically using mobility to get the access we need.
p85
aVBut when we live in a denser community,
p86
aVsuddenly what we find, of course,
p87
aVis that the things we need are close by.
p88
aVAnd since the most sustainable trip
p89
aVis the one that you never had to make in the first place,
p90
aVsuddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.
p91
aVAnd it is possible, of course,
p92
aVto increase the density of the communities around us.
p93
aa(lp94
VSome places are doing this with new eco districts,
p95
aVdeveloping whole new sustainable neighborhoods,
p96
aVwhich is nice work if you can get it,
p97
aVbut most of the time, what we're talking about is, in fact,
p98
aVreweaving the urban fabric that we already have.
p99
aVSo we're talking about things like infill development:
p100
aVreally sharp little changes
p101
aVto where we have buildings, where we're developing.
p102
aVUrban retrofitting:
p103
aVcreating different sorts of spaces and uses
p104
aVout of places that are already there.
p105
aVIncreasingly, we're realizing
p106
aVthat we don't even need to densify an entire city.
p107
aVWhat we need instead is an average density
p108
aVthat rises to a level
p109
aVwhere we don't drive as much and so on.
p110
aVAnd that can be done
p111
aVby raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot.
p112
aVSo you can think of it as tent poles
p113
aVthat actually raise the density of the entire city.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd we find that when we do that,
p116
aVwe can, in fact, have a few places that are really hyper-dense
p117
aVwithin a wider fabric of places
p118
aVthat are perhaps a little more comfortable
p119
aVand achieve the same results.
p120
aVNow we may find that there are places that are really, really dense
p121
aVand still hold onto their cars,
p122
aVbut the reality is that, by and large,
p123
aVwhat we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions
p124
aVis a threshold effect,
p125
aVwhere people simply stop driving as much,
p126
aVand increasingly, more and more people,
p127
aVif they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home,
p128
aVgive up their cars altogether.
p129
aVAnd this is a huge, huge energy savings,
p130
aVbecause what comes out of our tailpipe
p131
aVis really just the beginning of the story
p132
aVwith climate emissions from cars.
p133
aVWe have the manufacture of the car, the disposal of the car,
p134
aVall of the parking and freeways and so on.
p135
aVWhen you can get rid of all of those
p136
aVbecause somebody doesn't use any of them really,
p137
aVyou find that you can actually cut transportation emissions
p138
aVas much as 90 percent.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd people are embracing this.
p141
aVAll around the world, we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life.
p142
aVPeople are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home
p143
aVto the dream neighborhood.
p144
aVAnd when you layer that over
p145
aVwith the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see,
p146
aVwhat you find is, in fact,
p147
aVeven more access suffused into spaces.
p148
aVSome of it's transportation access.
p149
aVThis is a Mapnificent map that shows me, in this case,
p150
aVhow far I can get from my home in 30 minutes
p151
aVusing public transportation.
p152
aVSome of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet.
p153
aVThis is Google Walking Maps.
p154
aVI asked how to do the greater Ridgeway,
p155
aVand it told me to go via Guernsey.
p156
aVIt did tell me that this route
p157
aVmaybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths, though.
p158
aV(Laughter)
p159
aVBut the technologies are getting better,
p160
aVand we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation.
p161
aVAnd as we just heard earlier,
p162
aVof course, we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects.
p163
aVThings that don't have any wiring in them at all,
p164
aVwe're learning how to include
p165
aVin these systems of notation and navigation.
p166
aa(lp167
VPart of what we're finding with this
p168
aVis that what we thought
p169
aVwas the major point
p170
aVof manufacturing and consumption,
p171
aVwhich is to get a bunch of stuff,
p172
aVis not, in fact,
p173
aVhow we really live best in dense environments.
p174
aVWhat we're finding is that what we want
p175
aVis access to the capacities of things.
p176
aVMy favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill, a home power drill?
p177
aVOkay. I do too.
p178
aVThe average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes
p179
aVin its entire lifetime,
p180
aVdepending on who you ask.
p181
aVAnd so what we do is we buy these drills
p182
aVthat have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time,
p183
aVuse them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.
p184
aVOur cities, I would put to you,
p185
aVare stockpiles of these surplus capacities.
p186
aVAnd while we could try and figure out
p187
aVnew ways to use those capacities \u2014
p188
aVsuch as cooking or making ice sculptures
p189
aVor even a mafia hit \u2014
p190
aVwhat we probably will find
p191
aVis that, in fact, turning those products into services
p192
aVthat we have access to when we want them,
p193
aVis a far smarter way to go.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd in fact, even space itself is turning into a service.
p196
aVWe're finding that people can share the same spaces,
p197
aVdo stuff with vacant space.
p198
aVBuildings are becoming bundles of services.
p199
aVSo we have new designs
p200
aVthat are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on \u2014
p201
aVlike heating, cooling etc. \u2014
p202
aVand turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on.
p203
aVSo we light our buildings with daylight.
p204
aVWe cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine.
p205
aVIn fact, when we use all these things,
p206
aVwhat we've found is that, in some cases,
p207
aVenergy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent.
p208
aVWhich brings on another threshold effect
p209
aVI like to call furnace dumping,
p210
aVwhich is, quite simply,
p211
aVif you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace,
p212
aVyou save a whole bunch of money up front.
p213
aVThese things actually become cheaper to build
p214
aVthan the alternatives.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow when we look at being able
p217
aVto slash our product use, slash our transportation use,
p218
aVslash our building energy use,
p219
aVall of that is great, but it still leaves something behind.
p220
aVAnd if we're going to really, truly become sustainable cities,
p221
aVwe need to think a little differently.
p222
aVThis is one way to do it.
p223
aVThis is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are.
p224
aVAnd certainly lots of people have taken to heart
p225
aVthis idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.
p226
aVSo we have visions like this.
p227
aVWe have visions like this. We have visions like this.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow all of these are fine projects,
p230
aVbut they really have missed an essential point,
p231
aVwhich is it's not about the leaves above,
p232
aVit's about the systems below.
p233
aVDo they, for instance, capture rainwater
p234
aVso that we can reduce water use?
p235
aVWater is energy intensive.
p236
aVDo they, perhaps, include green infrastructure,
p237
aVso that we can take runoff
p238
aVand water that's going out of our houses
p239
aVand clean it and filter it
p240
aVand grow urban street trees?
p241
aVDo they connect us back to the ecosystems around us
p242
aVby, for example, connecting us to rivers
p243
aVand allowing for restoration?
p244
aVDo they allow for pollination,
p245
aVpollinator pathways
p246
aVthat bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities?
p247
aVDo they even take the very waste matter
p248
aVthat we have from food and fiber and so forth,
p249
aVand turn it back into soil
p250
aVand sequester carbon \u2014
p251
aVtake carbon out of the air
p252
aVin the process of using our cities?
p253
aa(lp254
VI would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible,
p255
aVthey're being done right now,
p256
aVand that it's a darn good thing.
p257
aVBecause right now, our economy by and large
p258
aVoperates as Paul Hawken said,
p259
aV"by stealing the future, selling it in the present
p260
aVand calling it GDP."
p261
aVAnd if we have another eight billion
p262
aVor seven billion,
p263
aVor six billion, even, people,
p264
aVliving on a planet where their cities also steal the future,
p265
aVwe're going to run out of future really fast.
p266
aVBut if we think differently,
p267
aVI think that, in fact, we can have cities
p268
aVthat are not only zero emissions,
p269
aVbut have unlimited possibilities as well.
p270
aa(lp271
VThank you very much.

If you want more reasons to think things may still turn out for the better, Alex Steffen&#39;s your man. He doesn&#39;t downplay the scope and scale of the problems we face. Instead, he shows that we have the tools within our grasp for meeting those massive challenges, if we have the will to use them.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t just hopeful thinking, either. Steffen uses real-world examples and big-picture research to show us that a brighter, greener future is ours to choose, and his work has earned him the ear of leading cities, corporations and philanthropic foundations. As the <em>New York Time</em>s said a recent profile, &quot;Alex Steffen lays out the blueprint for a successful century.&quot;<br /><br />After working as a journalist on four continents, Steffen co-founded and ran the online magazine <a href=\\"http://worldchanging.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Worldchanging.com</a> from 2003-2010. In those seven years, he made Worldchanging one of the world&#39;s leading sustainability-related publications with an archive of almost 12,000 articles and a large global audience. He also edited an internationally best-selling book surveying innovative solutions to the planet&#39;s most pressing problems:&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/worldchanging\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Worldchanging: A User&#39;s Guide for the 21st Century</a>.</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />His most recent work is&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/carbonzero\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Carbon Zero</em></a>, a book describing cities that create prosperity not climate change, accelerating their economies while reducing their climate emissions to zero. He is now at work on a new book and a television project. &quot;The big open secret about sustainability work,&quot; he recently told <em>Design Observer</em> magazine, &#39;is not how bad things are. It is how good things can get.&quot;</p>", "slug": "alex_steffen", "whotheyare": "Alex Steffen explores our planet\'s future, telling powerful, inspiring stories about the hard choices facing humanity ... and our opportunity to create a much better tomorrow.", "whatotherssay": "His vision of the future isn\'t granola and porridge.

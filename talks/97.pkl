VWhen you have 21 minutes to speak,
p5
aVtwo million years seems like a really long time.
p6
aVBut evolutionarily, two million years is nothing.
p7
aVAnd yet in two million years,
p8
aVthe human brain has nearly tripled in mass,
p9
aVgoing from the one-and-a-quarter pound brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,
p10
aVto the almost three-pound meatloaf
p11
aVthat everybody here has between their ears.
p12
aVWhat is it about a big brain
p13
aVthat nature was so eager for every one of us to have one?
p14
aa(lp15
VWell, it turns out when brains triple in size,
p16
aVthey don't just get three times bigger; they gain new structures.
p17
aVAnd one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part,
p18
aVcalled the "frontal lobe."
p19
aVParticularly, a part called the "pre-frontal cortex."
p20
aVWhat does a pre-frontal cortex do for you that should justify
p21
aVthe entire architectural overhaul of the human skull
p22
aVin the blink of evolutionary time?
p23
aa(lp24
VIt turns out the pre-frontal cortex does lots of things,
p25
aVbut one of the most important things it does is an experience simulator.
p26
aVPilots practice in flight simulators
p27
aVso that they don't make real mistakes in planes.
p28
aVHuman beings have this marvelous adaptation
p29
aVthat they can actually have experiences in their heads
p30
aVbefore they try them out in real life.
p31
aVThis is a trick that none of our ancestors could do,
p32
aVand that no other animal can do quite like we can.
p33
aVIt's a marvelous adaptation.
p34
aVIt's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language
p35
aVas one of the things that got our species out of the trees
p36
aVand into the shopping mall.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VAll of you have done this.
p41
aVBen and Jerry's doesn't have liver-and-onion ice cream,
p42
aVand it's not because they whipped some up, tried it and went, "Yuck."
p43
aVIt's because, without leaving your armchair,
p44
aVyou can simulate that flavor and say "yuck" before you make it.
p45
aa(lp46
VLet's see how your experience simulators are working.
p47
aVLet's just run a quick diagnostic
p48
aVbefore I proceed with the rest of the talk.
p49
aVHere's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate.
p50
aVYou can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer.
p51
aVOne of them is winning the lottery. This is about 314 million dollars.
p52
aVAnd the other is becoming paraplegic.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VJust give it a moment of thought.
p57
aVYou probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought.
p58
aa(lp59
VInterestingly, there are data on these two groups of people,
p60
aVdata on how happy they are.
p61
aVAnd this is exactly what you expected, isn't it?
p62
aVBut these aren't the data. I made these up!
p63
aa(lp64
VThese are the data.
p65
aVYou failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture.
p66
aVBecause the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs,
p67
aVand a year after winning the lotto, lottery winners and paraplegics
p68
aVare equally happy with their lives.
p69
aa(lp70
VDon't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz,
p71
aVbecause everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time.
p72
aVThe research that my laboratory has been doing,
p73
aVthat economists and psychologists around the country have been doing,
p74
aVhas revealed something really quite startling to us,
p75
aVsomething we call the "impact bias,"
p76
aVwhich is the tendency for the simulator to work badly.
p77
aVFor the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes
p78
aVare more different than in fact they really are.
p79
aa(lp80
VFrom field studies to laboratory studies,
p81
aVwe see that winning or losing an election, gaining or losing a romantic partner,
p82
aVgetting or not getting a promotion, passing or not passing a college test,
p83
aVon and on, have far less impact, less intensity and much less duration
p84
aVthan people expect them to have.
p85
aVThis almost floors me \u2014
p86
aVa recent study showing how major life traumas affect people
p87
aVsuggests that if it happened over three months ago,
p88
aVwith only a few exceptions,
p89
aVit has no impact whatsoever on your happiness.
p90
aa(lp91
VWhy?
p92
aVBecause happiness can be synthesized.
p93
aVSir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642, "I am the happiest man alive.
p94
aVI have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity.
p95
aVI am more invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me."
p96
aVWhat kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head?
p97
aa(lp98
VWell, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have.
p99
aVHuman beings have something
p100
aVthat we might think of as a "psychological immune system."
p101
aVA system of cognitive processes, largely non-conscious cognitive processes,
p102
aVthat help them change their views of the world,
p103
aVso that they can feel better
p104
aVabout the worlds in which they find themselves.
p105
aVLike Sir Thomas, you have this machine.
p106
aVUnlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it.
p107
aa(lp108
VWe synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found.
p109
aVNow, you don't need me to give you
p110
aVtoo many examples of people synthesizing happiness, I suspect.
p111
aVThough I'm going to show you some experimental evidence,
p112
aVyou don't have to look very far for evidence.
p113
aVI took a copy of the New York Times
p114
aVand tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness.
p115
aVHere are three guys synthesizing happiness.
p116
aV"I'm better off physically, financially, mentally ...
p117
aV"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience."
p118
aV"I believe it turned out for the best."
p119
aa(lp120
VWho are these characters who are so damn happy?
p121
aVThe first one is Jim Wright.
p122
aVSome of you are old enough to remember:
p123
aVhe was the chairman of the House of Representatives
p124
aVand he resigned in disgrace
p125
aVwhen this young Republican named Newt Gingrich
p126
aVfound out about a shady book deal he had done.
p127
aVHe lost everything.
p128
aVThe most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything.
p129
aVHe lost his money, he lost his power.
p130
aVWhat does he have to say all these years later?
p131
aV"I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally
p132
aVand in almost every other way."
p133
aVWhat other way would there be to be better off?
p134
aVVegetably? Minerally? Animally?
p135
aVHe's pretty much covered them there.
p136
aa(lp137
VMoreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of.
p138
aVMoreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released.
p139
aVHe was 78 years old.
p140
aVHe'd spent 37 years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary
p141
aVfor a crime he didn't commit.
p142
aV[He was ultimately released
p143
aVfor good behavior halfway through his sentence.]
p144
aVWhat did he say about his experience?
p145
aV"I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience." Glorious!
p146
aVHe is not saying,
p147
aV"Well, there were some nice guys. They had a gym."
p148
aV"Glorious,"
p149
aVa word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience.
p150
aa(lp151
VHarry S. Langerman uttered these words, and he's somebody you might have known
p152
aVbut didn't, because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper
p153
aVabout a hamburger stand owned by two brothers named McDonalds.
p154
aVAnd he thought, "That's a really neat idea!"
p155
aVSo he went to find them. They said,
p156
aV"We can give you a franchise on this for 3,000 bucks."
p157
aVHarry went back to New York, asked his brother, an investment banker,
p158
aVto loan him the $3,000, and his brother's immortal words were,
p159
aV"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers."
p160
aVHe wouldn't lend him the money,
p161
aVand of course, six months later Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea.
p162
aVIt turns out people do eat hamburgers,
p163
aVand Ray Kroc, for a while, became the richest man in America.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd then, finally,
p166
aVsome of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best,
p167
aVwho was the original drummer for the Beatles,
p168
aVuntil they, you know, sent him out on an errand and snuck away
p169
aVand picked up Ringo on a tour.
p170
aVWell, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed \u2014
p171
aVyes, he's still a drummer; yes, he's a studio musician \u2014
p172
aVhe had this to say: "I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles."
p173
aa(lp174
VOkay. There's something important to be learned from these people,
p175
aVand it is the secret of happiness.
p176
aVHere it is, finally to be revealed.
p177
aVFirst: accrue wealth, power, and prestige, then lose it.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VSecond: spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VThird: make somebody else really, really rich.
p186
aVAnd finally: never ever join the Beatles.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aVYeah, right.
p190
aVBecause when people synthesize happiness,
p191
aVas these gentlemen seem to have done,
p192
aVwe all smile at them, but we kind of roll our eyes and say,
p193
aV"Yeah right, you never really wanted the job."
p194
aV"Oh yeah, right. You really didn't have that much in common with her,
p195
aVand you figured that out just about the time
p196
aVshe threw the engagement ring in your face."
p197
aVWe smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness
p198
aVis not of the same quality as what we might call "natural happiness."
p199
aa(lp200
VWhat are these terms?
p201
aVNatural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted,
p202
aVand synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted.
p203
aVAnd in our society, we have a strong belief
p204
aVthat synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind.
p205
aa(lp206
VWhy do we have that belief?
p207
aVWell, it's very simple.
p208
aVWhat kind of economic engine would keep churning
p209
aVif we believed that not getting what we want
p210
aVcould make us just as happy as getting it?
p211
aVWith all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard,
p212
aVa shopping mall full of Zen monks
p213
aVis not going to be particularly profitable,
p214
aVbecause they don't want stuff enough.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VI want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness
p219
aVis every bit as real and enduring
p220
aVas the kind of happiness you stumble upon
p221
aVwhen you get exactly what you were aiming for.
p222
aVI'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric,
p223
aVbut by marinating you in a little bit of data.
p224
aa(lp225
VLet me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used
p226
aVto demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks.
p227
aVAnd this isn't mine.
p228
aVIt's a 50-year-old paradigm called the "free choice paradigm."
p229
aVIt's very simple.
p230
aVYou bring in, say, six objects,
p231
aVand you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked.
p232
aVIn this case, because this experiment uses them,
p233
aVthese are Monet prints.
p234
aVSo, everybody can rank these Monet prints
p235
aVfrom the one they like the most, to the one they like the least.
p236
aVNow we give you a choice:
p237
aV"We happen to have some extra prints in the closet.
p238
aVWe're going to give you one as your prize to take home.
p239
aVWe happen to have number three and number four," we tell the subject.
p240
aVThis is a bit of a difficult choice,
p241
aVbecause neither one is preferred strongly to the other,
p242
aVbut naturally, people tend to pick number three
p243
aVbecause they liked it a little better than number four.
p244
aa(lp245
VSometime later \u2014 it could be 15 minutes; it could be 15 days \u2014
p246
aVthe same stimuli are put before the subject,
p247
aVand the subject is asked to re-rank the stimuli.
p248
aV"Tell us how much you like them now."
p249
aVWhat happens?
p250
aVWatch as happiness is synthesized.
p251
aVThis is the result that has been replicated over and over again.
p252
aVYou're watching happiness be synthesized.
p253
aVWould you like to see it again?
p254
aVHappiness!
p255
aV"The one I got is really better than I thought!
p256
aVThat other one I didn't get sucks!"
p257
aVThat's the synthesis of happiness.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, what's the right response to that?
p262
aV"Yeah, right!"
p263
aVNow, here's the experiment we did,
p264
aVand I hope this is going to convince you
p265
aVthat "Yeah, right!" was not the right response.
p266
aa(lp267
VWe did this experiment with a group of patients
p268
aVwho had anterograde amnesia.
p269
aVThese are hospitalized patients.
p270
aVMost of them have Korsakoff's syndrome,
p271
aVa polyneuritic psychosis.
p272
aVThey drank way too much, and they can't make new memories.
p273
aVOK? They remember their childhood, but if you walk in and introduce yourself,
p274
aVand then leave the room,
p275
aVwhen you come back, they don't know who you are.
p276
aa(lp277
VWe took our Monet prints to the hospital.
p278
aVAnd we asked these patients to rank them
p279
aVfrom the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least.
p280
aVWe then gave them the choice between number three and number four.
p281
aVLike everybody else, they said,
p282
aV"Gee, thanks Doc! That's great! I could use a new print.
p283
aVI'll take number three."
p284
aVWe explained we would have number three mailed to them.
p285
aVWe gathered up our materials and we went out of the room,
p286
aVand counted to a half hour.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VBack into the room, we say, "Hi, we're back."
p291
aVThe patients, bless them, say, "Ah, Doc, I'm sorry,
p292
aVI've got a memory problem; that's why I'm here.
p293
aVIf I've met you before, I don't remember."
p294
aV"Really, you don't remember? I was just here with the Monet prints?"
p295
aV"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue."
p296
aV"No problem, Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me
p297
aVfrom the one you like the most to the one you like the least."
p298
aa(lp299
VWhat do they do?
p300
aVWell, let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac.
p301
aVWe ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own,
p302
aVwhich one they chose last time, which one is theirs.
p303
aVAnd what we find is amnesiac patients just guess.
p304
aVThese are normal controls, where if I did this with you,
p305
aVall of you would know which print you chose.
p306
aVBut if I do this with amnesiac patients, they don't have a clue.
p307
aVThey can't pick their print out of a lineup.
p308
aa(lp309
VHere's what normal controls do: they synthesize happiness.
p310
aVRight? This is the change in liking score,
p311
aVthe change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked.
p312
aVNormal controls show \u2014 that was the magic I showed you;
p313
aVnow I'm showing it to you in graphical form \u2014
p314
aV"The one I own is better than I thought.
p315
aVThe one I didn't own, the one I left behind,
p316
aVis not as good as I thought."
p317
aVAmnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result.
p318
aa(lp319
VThese people like better the one they own,
p320
aVbut they don't know they own it.
p321
aV"Yeah, right" is not the right response!
p322
aVWhat these people did when they synthesized happiness
p323
aVis they really, truly changed
p324
aVtheir affective, hedonic, aesthetic reactions to that poster.
p325
aVThey're not just saying it because they own it,
p326
aVbecause they don't know they own it.
p327
aa(lp328
VWhen psychologists show you bars,
p329
aVyou know that they are showing you averages of lots of people.
p330
aVAnd yet, all of us have this psychological immune system,
p331
aVthis capacity to synthesize happiness,
p332
aVbut some of us do this trick better than others.
p333
aVAnd some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively
p334
aVthan other situations do.
p335
aVIt turns out that freedom,
p336
aVthe ability to make up your mind and change your mind,
p337
aVis the friend of natural happiness, because it allows you to choose
p338
aVamong all those delicious futures
p339
aVand find the one that you would most enjoy.
p340
aVBut freedom to choose,
p341
aVto change and make up your mind,
p342
aVis the enemy of synthetic happiness.
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd I'm going to show you why. Dilbert already knows, of course.
p345
aV"Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you?"
p346
aV"My printer prints a blank page after every document."
p347
aV"Why complain about getting free paper?"
p348
aV"Free? Aren't you just giving me my own paper?"
p349
aV"Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper!
p350
aVOnly a fool or a liar would say that they look the same!"
p351
aV"Now that you mention it, it does seem a little silkier!"
p352
aV"What are you doing?"
p353
aV"I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change." Indeed.
p354
aa(lp355
VThe psychological immune system works best
p356
aVwhen we are totally stuck, when we are trapped.
p357
aVThis is the difference between dating and marriage.
p358
aVYou go out on a date with a guy,
p359
aVand he picks his nose; you don't go out on another date.
p360
aVYou're married to a guy and he picks his nose?
p361
aVHe has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake!
p362
aVYou find a way to be happy with what's happened.
p363
aa(lp364
V(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
VNow, what I want to show you
p367
aVis that people don't know this about themselves,
p368
aVand not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage.
p369
aa(lp370
VHere's an experiment we did at Harvard.
p371
aVWe created a black-and-white photography course,
p372
aVand we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom.
p373
aVSo we gave them cameras; they went around campus;
p374
aVthey took 12 pictures of their favorite professors
p375
aVand their dorm room and their dog,
p376
aVand all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of.
p377
aVThey bring us the camera; we make up a contact sheet;
p378
aVthey figure out which are the two best pictures;
p379
aVand we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms.
p380
aVAnd they blow two of them up,
p381
aVand they have two gorgeous eight-by-10 glossies
p382
aVof meaningful things to them, and we say,
p383
aV"Which one would you like to give up?"
p384
aV"I have to give one up?"
p385
aV"Yes, we need one as evidence of the class project.
p386
aVSo you have to give me one. You have to make a choice.
p387
aVYou get to keep one, and I get to keep one."
p388
aa(lp389
VNow, there are two conditions in this experiment.
p390
aVIn one case, the students are told,
p391
aV"But you know, if you want to change your mind,
p392
aVI'll always have the other one here,
p393
aVand in the next four days, before I actually mail it to headquarters" \u2014
p394
aVYeah, "headquarters" \u2014
p395
aV"I'll be glad to swap it out with you.
p396
aVIn fact, I'll come to your dorm room, just give me an email.
p397
aVBetter yet, I'll check with you.
p398
aVYou ever want to change your mind, it's totally returnable."
p399
aVThe other half of the students are told exactly the opposite:
p400
aV"Make your choice, and by the way,
p401
aVthe mail is going out, gosh, in two minutes, to England.
p402
aVYour picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic.
p403
aVYou will never see it again."
p404
aVHalf of the students in each of these conditions
p405
aVare asked to make predictions
p406
aVabout how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep
p407
aVand the picture they leave behind.
p408
aVOther students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms
p409
aVand they are measured over the next three to six days
p410
aVon their liking, satisfaction with the pictures.
p411
aVAnd look at what we find.
p412
aa(lp413
VFirst of all, here's what students think is going to happen.
p414
aVThey think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose
p415
aVa little more than the one they left behind,
p416
aVbut these are not statistically significant differences.
p417
aVIt's a very small increase, and it doesn't much matter
p418
aVwhether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition.
p419
aa(lp420
VWrong-o. Bad simulators. Because here's what's really happening.
p421
aVBoth right before the swap and five days later,
p422
aVpeople who are stuck with that picture,
p423
aVwho have no choice,
p424
aVwho can never change their mind,
p425
aVlike it a lot!
p426
aVAnd people who are deliberating \u2014 "Should I return it?
p427
aVHave I gotten the right one? Maybe this isn't the good one?
p428
aVMaybe I left the good one?" \u2014 have killed themselves.
p429
aVThey don't like their picture,
p430
aVand in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired,
p431
aVthey still don't like their picture.
p432
aVWhy?
p433
aVBecause the [reversible] condition is not conducive
p434
aVto the synthesis of happiness.
p435
aa(lp436
VSo here's the final piece of this experiment.
p437
aVWe bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students
p438
aVand we say, "You know, we're doing a photography course,
p439
aVand we can do it one of two ways.
p440
aVWe could do it so that when you take the two pictures,
p441
aVyou'd have four days to change your mind,
p442
aVor we're doing another course where you take the two pictures
p443
aVand you make up your mind right away and you can never change it.
p444
aVWhich course would you like to be in?" Duh!
p445
aV66 percent of the students, two-thirds,
p446
aVprefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind.
p447
aVHello? 66 percent of the students choose to be in the course
p448
aVin which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture.
p449
aVBecause they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows.
p450
aa(lp451
VThe Bard said everything best, of course, and he's making my point here
p452
aVbut he's making it hyperbolically:
p453
aV"'Tis nothing good or bad / But thinking makes it so."
p454
aVIt's nice poetry, but that can't exactly be right.
p455
aVIs there really nothing good or bad?
p456
aVIs it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris
p457
aVare just the same thing?
p458
aV(Laughter)
p459
aVThat seems like a one-question IQ test.
p460
aVThey can't be exactly the same.
p461
aa(lp462
VIn more turgid prose, but closer to the truth,
p463
aVwas the father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, and he said this.
p464
aVThis is worth contemplating:
p465
aV"The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life
p466
aVseems to arise from overrating the difference
p467
aVbetween one permanent situation and another \u2014
p468
aVSome of these situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others,
p469
aVbut none of them can deserve to be pursued
p470
aVwith that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules
p471
aVeither of prudence or of justice,
p472
aVor to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds,
p473
aVeither by shame from the remembrance of our own folly,
p474
aVor by remorse for the horror of our own injustice."
p475
aVIn other words: yes, some things are better than others.
p476
aa(lp477
VWe should have preferences that lead us into one future over another.
p478
aVBut when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast
p479
aVbecause we have overrated the difference between these futures,
p480
aVwe are at risk.
p481
aVWhen our ambition is bounded, it leads us to work joyfully.
p482
aVWhen our ambition is unbounded,
p483
aVit leads us to lie, to cheat, to steal, to hurt others,
p484
aVto sacrifice things of real value.
p485
aVWhen our fears are bounded,
p486
aVwe're prudent, we're cautious,
p487
aVwe're thoughtful.
p488
aVWhen our fears are unbounded and overblown,
p489
aVwe're reckless, and we're cowardly.
p490
aa(lp491
VThe lesson I want to leave you with, from these data,
p492
aVis that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown,
p493
aVbecause we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity
p494
aVwe are constantly chasing when we choose experience.
p495
aa(lp496
VThank you.
p497
aV(Applause)

In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone&#39;s eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that <strong>our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy</strong>. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<br /><br />The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert&#39;s writing, which is <strong>lucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny</strong>. The immensely readable <em><a href=\\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Stumbling on Happiness</a>,</em> published in 2006, became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 20 languages.<br /><br />In fact, the title of his book could be drawn from his own life. At 19, he was a high school dropout with dreams of writing science fiction. When a creative writing class at his community college was full, he enrolled in the only available course: psychology. He found his passion there, earned a doctorate in social psychology in 1985 at Princeton, and has since won a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Phi Beta Kappa teaching prize for his work at Harvard. He has written essays and articles for <em>The New York Times, Time</em> and even <a href=\\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/STARBUCKS%20CUP.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Starbucks</a>, while <strong>continuing his research into happiness at his <a href=\\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Hedonic Psychology Laboratory</a>.</strong></p>", "slug": "dan_gilbert", "whotheyare": "Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says our beliefs about what will make us happy are often wrong -- a premise he supports with intriguing research, and explains in his accessible and unexpectedly funny book, <em>Stumbling on Happiness.</em>", "whatotherssay": "Gilbert\'s elbow-in-the-ribs social-science humor is actually funny. ...

that, in our ardent, lifelong pursuit of happiness, most of us have the wrong map. In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone&#39;s eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that <strong>our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy</strong>. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<br /><br />The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert&#39;s writing, which is <strong>lucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny</strong>. The immensely readable <em><a href=\\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Stumbling on Happiness</a>,</em> published in 2006, became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 20 languages.<br /><br />In fact, the title of his book could be drawn from his own life. At 19, he was a high school dropout with dreams of writing science fiction. When a creative writing class at his community college was full, he enrolled in the only available course: psychology. He found his passion there, earned a doctorate in social psychology in 1985 at Princeton, and has since won a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Phi Beta Kappa teaching prize for his work at Harvard. He has written essays and articles for <em>The New York Times, Time</em> and even <a href=\\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/STARBUCKS%20CUP.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Starbucks</a>, while <strong>continuing his research into happiness at his <a href=\\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Hedonic Psychology Laboratory</a>.</strong></p>", "slug": "dan_gilbert", "whotheyare": "Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says our beliefs about what will make us happy are often wrong -- a premise he supports with intriguing research, and explains in his accessible and unexpectedly funny book, <em>Stumbling on Happiness.</em>", "whatotherssay": "Gilbert\'s elbow-in-the-ribs social-science humor is actually funny. ...

First, most of us would expect lottery winners to be much happier than controls, and they weren\\u2019t. Second, most of us would expect paraplegics to be wildly less happy than either controls or lottery winners, and in fact they were only slightly less happy (though it is admittedly difficult to interpret numerical differences on rating scales like the ones used in this study). As the authors of the paper noted, \\u201cIn general, lottery winners rated winning the lottery as a highly positive event, and paraplegics rated their accident as a highly negative event, though neither outcome was rated as extremely as might have been expected.\\u201d Almost 40 years later, I suspect that most psychologists would agree that this study produced rather weak and inconclusive findings, but that the point it made about the unanticipated power of hedonic adaptation has now been confirmed by many more powerful and methodologically superior studies.

I said, \\u201cHe spent 37 years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn\\u2019t commit. He was ultimately exonerated, at the age of 78, through DNA evidence.\\u201d First, whether Mr. Bickham did or did not commit the crime is debatable. His attorney tells me that he believes Mr. Bickham was innocent, the state evidently believed otherwise, and I am no judge.  Second, Mr. Bickham was not exonerated on the basis of DNA evidence, but rather, was released for good behavior after serving half his sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow I managed to mangle these facts is something I still scratch my head about. Bad notes? Bad sources? Demonic possession? Sorry, I just don\\u2019t remember. But while I got these ancillary facts wrong, I got the key facts right: Mr. Bickham did spend 37 years in prison, he did utter those words upon his release, and he was (and apparently still is) much happier than most of us would expect ourselves to be in such circumstances.

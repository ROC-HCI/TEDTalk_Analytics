VYou may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise
p5
aVbeing 72 virgins,
p6
aVand I promise I will come back to those virgins.
p7
aVBut in fact, here in the Northwest, we're living very close
p8
aVto the real Koranic idea of paradise,
p9
aVdefined 36 times as "gardens watered by running streams."
p10
aVSince I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union,
p11
aVthis makes perfect sense to me.
p12
aVBut the thing is, how come it's news to most people?
p13
aVI know many well-intentioned non-Muslims
p14
aVwho've begun reading the Koran, but given up,
p15
aVdisconcerted by its "otherness."
p16
aVThe historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad
p17
aVone of the world's greatest heroes,
p18
aVyet even he called the Koran
p19
aV"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook; a wearisome, confused jumble."
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VPart of the problem, I think, is that we imagine
p24
aVthat the Koran can be read as we usually read a book \u2014
p25
aVas though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon
p26
aVwith a bowl of popcorn within reach,
p27
aVas though God \u2014
p28
aVand the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad \u2014
p29
aVwere just another author on the best-seller list.
p30
aVYet, the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran
p31
aVis precisely why it's so easy to quote \u2014 that is, to misquote.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VPhrases and snippets taken out of context
p36
aVin what I call the "highlighter version,"
p37
aVwhich is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists
p38
aVand anti-Muslim Islamophobes.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo this past spring,
p41
aVas I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad,
p42
aVI realized I needed to read the Koran properly \u2014
p43
aVas properly as I could, that is.
p44
aVMy Arabic is reduced by now to wielding a dictionary,
p45
aVso I took four well-known translations
p46
aVand decided to read them side by side, verse by verse,
p47
aValong with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic.
p48
aVNow, I did have an advantage.
p49
aVMy last book was about the story behind the Shi'a-Sunni split,
p50
aVand for that, I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories,
p51
aVso I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers,
p52
aVits frame of reference.
p53
aVI knew enough, that is, to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran \u2014
p54
aVan informed one,
p55
aVan experienced one, even,
p56
aVbut still an outsider,
p57
aVan agnostic Jew reading someone else's holy book.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VSo I read slowly.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VI'd set aside three weeks for this project,
p66
aVand that, I think, is what is meant by "hubris" \u2014
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
Vbecause it turned out to be three months.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VI did resist the temptation to skip to the back,
p75
aVwhere the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are.
p76
aVBut every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran \u2014
p77
aVthat feeling of "I get it now" \u2014
p78
aVit would slip away overnight,
p79
aVand I'd come back in the morning,
p80
aVwondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land.
p81
aVAnd yet, the terrain was very familiar.
p82
aVThe Koran declares that it comes to renew the message
p83
aVof the Torah and the Gospels.
p84
aVSo one-third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures
p85
aVlike Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.
p86
aVGod himself was utterly familiar
p87
aVfrom his earlier manifestation as Yahweh,
p88
aVjealously insisting on no other gods.
p89
aVThe presence of camels, mountains, desert wells and springs
p90
aVtook me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert.
p91
aVAnd then there was the language, the rhythmic cadence of it,
p92
aVreminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders
p93
aVrecite hours-long narrative poems
p94
aVentirely from memory.
p95
aVAnd I began to grasp why it's said
p96
aVthat the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic.
p97
aa(lp98
VTake the Fatihah, the seven-verse opening chapter
p99
aVthat is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.
p100
aVIt's just 29 words in Arabic,
p101
aVbut anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.
p102
aVAnd yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing.
p103
aVThe Arabic has an incantatory, almost hypnotic quality
p104
aVthat begs to be heard rather than read,
p105
aVfelt more than analyzed.
p106
aVIt wants to be chanted out loud,
p107
aVto sound its music in the ear and on the tongue.
p108
aVSo the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself,
p109
aVor as Arthur Arberry called his version,
p110
aV"an interpretation."
p111
aVBut all is not lost in translation.
p112
aa(lp113
VAs the Koran promises, patience is rewarded,
p114
aVand there are many surprises \u2014
p115
aVa degree of environmental awareness, for instance,
p116
aVand of humans as mere stewards of God's creation,
p117
aVunmatched in the Bible.
p118
aVAnd where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men,
p119
aVusing the second- and third-person masculine,
p120
aVthe Koran includes women \u2014
p121
aVtalking, for instance,
p122
aVof believing men and believing women,
p123
aVhonorable men and honorable women.
p124
aVOr take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers.
p125
aVYes, it does say that,
p126
aVbut in a very specific context:
p127
aVthe anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca,
p128
aVwhere fighting was usually forbidden.
p129
aVAnd the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers.
p130
aVNot "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,"
p131
aVbut you can, you are allowed to,
p132
aVbut only after a grace period is over,
p133
aVand only if there's no other pact in place,
p134
aVand only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba,
p135
aVand only if they attack you first.
p136
aVAnd even then \u2014 God is merciful;
p137
aVforgiveness is supreme \u2014
p138
aVand so, essentially,
p139
aVbetter if you don't.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VThis was perhaps the biggest surprise \u2014
p144
aVhow flexible the Koran is,
p145
aVat least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible.
p146
aa(lp147
V"Some of these verses are definite in meaning," it says,
p148
aV"and others are ambiguous."
p149
aVThe perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities,
p150
aVtrying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own.
p151
aVOnly God knows the true meaning.
p152
aVThe phrase "God is subtle" appears again and again,
p153
aVand indeed, the whole of the Koran is far more subtle
p154
aVthan most of us have been led to believe.
p155
aVAs in, for instance, that little matter of virgins and paradise.
p156
aVOld-fashioned orientalism comes into play here.
p157
aVThe word used four times is "houris,"
p158
aVrendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts,
p159
aVor as fair, high-bosomed virgins.
p160
aVYet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word: houris.
p161
aVNot a swelling breast or high bosom in sight.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VNow this may be a way of saying "pure beings," like in angels,
p166
aVor it may be like the Greek "kouros" or "kore,"
p167
aVan eternal youth.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut the truth is, nobody really knows.
p170
aVAnd that's the point.
p171
aVBecause the Koran is quite clear
p172
aVwhen it says that you'll be "a new creation in paradise,"
p173
aVand that you will be "recreated in a form unknown to you,"
p174
aVwhich seems to me a far more appealing prospect
p175
aVthan a virgin.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd that number 72 never appears.
p180
aVThere are no 72 virgins in the Koran.
p181
aVThat idea only came into being 300 years later,
p182
aVand most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent
p183
aVof people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps.
p184
aVParadise is quite the opposite.
p185
aVIt's not virginity;
p186
aVit's fecundity;
p187
aVit's plenty.
p188
aVIt's gardens watered by running streams.
p189
aa(lp190
VThank you.

VI'm supposed to scare you, because it's about fear, right?
p5
aVAnd you should be really afraid,
p6
aVbut not for the reasons why you think you should be.
p7
aVYou should be really afraid that \u2014
p8
aVif we stick up the first slide on this thing \u2014 there we go \u2014 that you're missing out.
p9
aVBecause if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and
p10
aVthinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market,
p11
aVyou're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on.
p12
aVAnd this is what this adventure's really about.
p13
aVThis is crystallized DNA.
p14
aVEvery life form on this planet \u2014 every insect, every bacteria, every plant,
p15
aVevery animal, every human, every politician \u2014 (Laughter)
p16
aVis coded in that stuff.
p17
aVAnd if you want to take a single crystal of DNA, it looks like that.
p18
aVAnd we're just beginning to understand this stuff.
p19
aVAnd this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on.
p20
aVIt's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on.
p21
aVIf you think that the mapping of America's made a difference,
p22
aVor landing on the moon, or this other stuff,
p23
aVit's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant
p24
aVand every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference.
p25
aVAnd it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VIt turns out that what this stuff is \u2014
p29
aVand Richard Dawkins has written about this \u2014
p30
aVis, this is really a river out of Eden.
p31
aVSo, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells
p32
aVis really a history of where you've been for the past billion years.
p33
aVAnd we could start dating things,
p34
aVand we could start changing medicine and archeology.
p35
aVIt turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,
p36
aVwhite Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.
p37
aVWhite Europeans were subject to the plague.
p38
aVAnd when they were subject to the plague, most people didn't survive,
p39
aVbut those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.
p40
aVAnd that mutation was passed on to their kids
p41
aVbecause they're the ones that survived,
p42
aVso there was a great deal of population pressure.
p43
aVIn Africa, because you didn't have these cities,
p44
aVyou didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation.
p45
aVWe can date it to 700 years ago.
p46
aVThat is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is,
p47
aVand not as fast across Europe.
p48
aVAnd we're beginning to find these little things for malaria,
p49
aVfor sickle cell, for cancers.
p50
aVAnd in the measure that we map ourselves,
p51
aVthis is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on.
p52
aVAnd this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine,
p53
aVand I want you to toast these two people.
p54
aVBecause this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,
p55
aVand that is almost as important a date
p56
aVas the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves,
p57
aVbut anyway, we'll get to that.
p58
aa(lp59
VI thought we'd talk about the new zoo.
p60
aVSo, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does,
p61
aVbut some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty
p62
aVbecause this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet.
p63
aVIf you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful,
p64
aVit turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there.
p65
aVAnd we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there,
p66
aVwhich is part of the reason
p67
aVwhy this whole species-mapping project is so important.
p68
aVBecause we're just beginning to learn
p69
aVwhere we came from and what we are.
p70
aVAnd we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia.
p71
aVAnd the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much,
p72
aVexcept that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,
p73
aVwhich is what makes you you,
p74
aVas far as gene code inside each of your cells,
p75
aVand this little amoeba which, you know,
p76
aVsits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,
p77
aVturns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.
p78
aVSo, this little thingamajig has a genome
p79
aVthat's 200 times the size of yours.
p80
aVAnd if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,
p81
aVit may not turn out to be chips.
p82
aVIt may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd, again, we're learning from life and how life works.
p85
aVThis funky little thing: people didn't used to think
p86
aVthat it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors
p87
aVbecause it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there.
p88
aVAnd then finally somebody picked up a microscope
p89
aVand looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.
p90
aVAnd sitting next to that water in the cores
p91
aVwas this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke,
p92
aVhaving its chromosomes blown apart every day,
p93
aVsix, seven times, restitching them,
p94
aVliving in about 200 times the radiation that would kill you.
p95
aVAnd by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse
p96
aVand how important and how interesting this journey into life is,
p97
aVand how many different life forms there are,
p98
aVand how there can be different life forms living in
p99
aVvery different places, maybe even outside of this planet.
p100
aVBecause if you can live in radiation that looks like this,
p101
aVthat brings up a whole series of interesting questions.
p102
aa(lp103
VThis little thingamajig: we didn't know this thingamajig existed.
p104
aVWe should have known that this existed
p105
aVbecause this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye.
p106
aVSo, this thing is 0.75 millimeters.
p107
aVIt lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia.
p108
aVAnd what you're looking at with this namibiensis
p109
aVis the biggest bacteria we've ever seen.
p110
aVSo, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence.
p111
aVAgain, we didn't know this thing was there three years ago.
p112
aVWe're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo.
p113
aa(lp114
VThis is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma.
p115
aVThe reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron,
p116
aVlives inside the equivalent of battery acid,
p117
aVand excretes sulfuric acid.
p118
aVSo, when you think of odd life forms,
p119
aVwhen you think of what it takes to live,
p120
aVit turns out this is a very efficient life form,
p121
aVand they call it an archaea. Archaea means "the ancient ones."
p122
aVAnd the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up
p123
aVwhen this planet was covered
p124
aVby things like sulfuric acid in batteries,
p125
aVand it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.
p126
aVSo, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins
p127
aVthat you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.
p128
aa(lp129
VYour fear should be that you are not,
p130
aVthat you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal.
p131
aVI mean, George Bush \u2014 he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't.
p132
aVWhether the humans survive or don't survive,
p133
aVthese things are going to be living on this planet or other planets.
p134
aVAnd it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA
p135
aVthat's really the most exciting intellectual adventure
p136
aVthat we've ever been on.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gaur.
p139
aVConservation group gets together,
p140
aVtries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct.
p141
aVThey can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is
p142
aVthey take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code,
p143
aVtake the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg,
p144
aVreprogram cow's egg \u2014 different gene code.
p145
aVWhen you do that, the cow gives birth to a gaur.
p146
aVWe are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elands, Sumatran tigers,
p147
aVand the Australians \u2014 bless their hearts \u2014
p148
aVare playing with these things.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, the last of these things died in September 1936.
p151
aVThese are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo.
p152
aVBut it turns out that as we learn more about gene code
p153
aVand how to reprogram species,
p154
aVwe may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.
p155
aVAnd when we learn how to close the gene gaps,
p156
aVthen we can put a full string of DNA together.
p157
aVAnd if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg,
p158
aVwe may give birth to an animal
p159
aVthat hasn't walked the earth since 1936.
p160
aVAnd then you can start going back further,
p161
aVand you can start thinking about dodos,
p162
aVand you can think about other species.
p163
aVAnd in other places, like Maryland, they're trying to figure out
p164
aVwhat the primordial ancestor is.
p165
aVBecause each of us contains our entire gene code
p166
aVof where we've been for the past billion years,
p167
aVbecause we've evolved from that stuff,
p168
aVyou can take that tree of life and collapse it back,
p169
aVand in the measure that you learn to reprogram,
p170
aVmaybe we'll give birth to something
p171
aVthat is very close to the first primordial ooze.
p172
aVAnd it's all coming out of things that look like this.
p173
aa(lp174
VThese are companies that didn't exist five years ago.
p175
aVHuge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields.
p176
aVSome are public. Some are private.
p177
aVIt takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time.
p178
aVTakes about 3 million dollars the second time.
p179
aVWe will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years.
p180
aVThat means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code.
p181
aVAnd it will be really boring. It will read like this.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVThe really neat thing about this stuff is that's life.
p184
aVAnd Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit.
p185
aVBecause if you happen to find this one inside your body,
p186
aVyou're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola.
p187
aVThat's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans.
p188
aVBut plants work the same way and insects work the same way,
p189
aVand this apple works the same way.
p190
aVThis apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.
p191
aVBecause this thing codes ones and zeros,
p192
aVand this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there,
p193
aVabsorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day
p194
aVit has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right?
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVAnd when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is,
p197
aVit executes the first line of code, which reads just like that,
p198
aVAATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root.
p199
aVNext line of code: make a stem.
p200
aVNext line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white,
p201
aVthat blooms in the spring, that smells like this.
p202
aVIn the measure that you have the code
p203
aVand the measure that you read it \u2014
p204
aVand, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago;
p205
aVthe first human was read two years ago;
p206
aVthe first insect was read two years ago.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe first thing that we ever read was in 1995:
p209
aVa little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae.
p210
aVIn the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know,
p211
aVyou can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms
p212
aVso that this little thingy becomes a vaccine,
p213
aVor this little thingy starts producing biomaterials,
p214
aVwhich is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester
p215
aVthat feels like silk in corn.
p216
aVThis changes all rules. This is life, but we're reprogramming it.
p217
aVThis is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes.
p218
aVAnd what you can do now is,
p219
aVyou can outlay exactly what your chromosome is,
p220
aVand what the gene code on that chromosome is right here,
p221
aVand what those genes code for, and what animals they code against,
p222
aVand then you can tie it to the literature.
p223
aVAnd in the measure that you can do that, you can go home today,
p224
aVand get on the Internet, and access
p225
aVthe world's biggest public library, which is a library of life.
p226
aVAnd you can do some pretty strange things
p227
aVbecause in the same way as you can reprogram this apple,
p228
aVif you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School,
p229
aVhe's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings.
p230
aVWhy would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant.
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VThe reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings
p234
aVis because when you used to play with lizards as a little child,
p235
aVand you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew.
p236
aVNot so in human beings:
p237
aVyou cut off an arm, you cut off a leg \u2014 it doesn't regrow.
p238
aVBut because each of your cells contains your entire gene code,
p239
aVeach cell can be reprogrammed, if we don't stop stem cell research
p240
aVand if we don't stop genomic research,
p241
aVto express different body functions.
p242
aVAnd in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings,
p243
aVand what the program is for those cells to differentiate,
p244
aVone of the things we're going to be able to do
p245
aVis to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer,
p246
aVand one of the things we're going to learn how to do
p247
aVis how to reprogram cells like stem cells
p248
aVin such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas.
p249
aVAnd you are likely to be wandering around \u2014 and your children \u2014
p250
aVon regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time,
p251
aVin some places in the world where they don't stop the research.
p252
aa(lp253
VHow's this stuff work? If each of you differs
p254
aVfrom the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes,
p255
aVwhich means it's only one in a thousand times three percent,
p256
aVvery small differences in expression and punctuation
p257
aVcan make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence.
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aVRight?
p260
aVThat's perfectly clear. So, men read that sentence,
p261
aVand they look at that sentence, and they read this.
p262
aVOkay?
p263
aVNow, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong.
p264
aVThis is the way it should be seen.
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aVThat's what your genes are doing.
p267
aVThat's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand.
p268
aVRight? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but...
p269
aVI won't go there.
p270
aVYou can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation.
p271
aVYou can look at this, right?
p272
aVAnd they look at the world a little differently.
p273
aVThey look at the same world and they say...
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVThat's how the same gene code \u2014 that's why you have 30,000 genes,
p276
aVmice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.
p277
aVMice and men are the same. Wives know that, but anyway.
p278
aVYou can make very small changes in gene code
p279
aVand get really different outcomes,
p280
aVeven with the same string of letters.
p281
aVThat's what your genes are doing every day.
p282
aVThat's why sometimes a person's genes
p283
aVdon't have to change a lot to get cancer.
p284
aa(lp285
VThese little chippies, these things are the size of a credit card.
p286
aVThey will test any one of you for 60,000 genetic conditions.
p287
aVThat brings up questions of privacy and insurability
p288
aVand all kinds of stuff, but it also allows us to start going after diseases,
p289
aVbecause if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this,
p290
aVit turns out that three diseases with
p291
aVcompletely similar clinical syndromes
p292
aVare completely different diseases.
p293
aVBecause in ALL leukemia, that set of genes over there over-expresses.
p294
aVIn MLL, it's the middle set of genes,
p295
aVand in AML, it's the bottom set of genes.
p296
aVAnd if one of those particular things is expressing in your body,
p297
aVthen you take Gleevec and you're cured.
p298
aVIf it is not expressing in your body,
p299
aVif you don't have one of those types \u2014
p300
aVa particular one of those types \u2014 don't take Gleevec.
p301
aVIt won't do anything for you.
p302
aVSame thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer.
p303
aVDon't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin.
p304
aVChanges the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine.
p305
aVChanges the way medicine works.
p306
aa(lp307
VThe greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college
p308
aVwas this thing, and it turns out that
p309
aVthis is not so important any more.
p310
aVThe U.S. Library of Congress, in terms of its printed volume of data,
p311
aVcontains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company
p312
aVevery month on a compound basis.
p313
aVLet me say that again: A single genomics company
p314
aVgenerates more data in a month, on a compound basis,
p315
aVthan is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress.
p316
aVThis is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law.
p317
aVSo, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months
p318
aVand the power doubles, right?
p319
aVExcept that when you lay that side by side with the speed
p320
aVwith which gene data's being deposited in GenBank,
p321
aVMoore's Law is right here: it's the blue line.
p322
aVThis is on a log scale, and that's what superexponential growth means.
p323
aVThis is going to push computers to have to grow faster
p324
aVthan they've been growing, because so far,
p325
aVthere haven't been applications that have been required
p326
aVthat need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd here's an interesting map.
p329
aVThis is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School.
p330
aVOne of the really interesting questions is, if all this data's free,
p331
aVwho's using it? This is the greatest public library in the world.
p332
aVWell, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bits
p333
aVmoving inside from the United States to the United States;
p334
aVabout 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries;
p335
aVabout 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communication
p336
aVbetween Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff.
p337
aVIt's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war;
p338
aVthey're focusing on Bush; they're not interested in life.
p339
aVSo, this is what a new map of the world looks like.
p340
aVThat is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem.
p341
aVIn fact, it's not a genomically literate world.
p342
aVYou can break this out by states.
p343
aVAnd you can watch states rise and fall depending on
p344
aVtheir ability to speak a language of life,
p345
aVand you can watch New York fall off a cliff,
p346
aVand you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff,
p347
aVand you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence.
p348
aVAnd you can break it out by counties, because it's specific counties.
p349
aVAnd if you want to get more specific,
p350
aVit's actually specific zip codes.
p351
aV(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VSo, you want to know where life is happening?
p354
aVWell, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it.
p355
aVAnd that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD,
p356
aVand it's called Torrey Pines Road.
p357
aVThat means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful;
p358
aVit means you don't need a lot of people to be successful;
p359
aVand it means you can move most of the wealth of a country
p360
aVin about three or four carefully picked 747s.
p361
aa(lp362
VSame thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but \u2014
p363
aVoh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous.
p364
aVWhat's the net effect of this?
p365
aVIn an agricultural society, the difference between
p366
aVthe richest and the poorest,
p367
aVthe most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why?
p368
aVBecause in agriculture, if you had 10 kids
p369
aVand you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder,
p370
aVyou could produce about five times more wealth, on average,
p371
aVthan your neighbor.
p372
aVIn a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1.
p373
aVIt really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writing
p374
aVin English and French and German,
p375
aVbut in Microsoft and Linux and Apple.
p376
aVAnd very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code.
p377
aVSo, if there is something you should fear,
p378
aVit's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball.
p379
aVBecause it really matters who speaks life.
p380
aVThat's why nations rise and fall.
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s,
p383
aVthe most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person.
p384
aVAnd New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950,
p385
aVand then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top \u2014
p386
aVbeat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks.
p387
aVAnd today, of course, you all know that the most productive nation
p388
aVon earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealth
p389
aVper person per year than America.
p390
aVTiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.
p391
aVJust smart people moving bits. Different rules.
p392
aa(lp393
VHere's differential productivity rates.
p394
aVHere's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.
p395
aVSo, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits,
p396
aV790,000 Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing?
p397
aVIt's got nothing to do with inflation.
p398
aVIt's got nothing to do with privatization.
p399
aVYou can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist,
p400
aVstick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country
p401
aVbecause he doesn't understand how the rules have changed.
p402
aVOh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians.
p403
aVWell, watch what happens to India.
p404
aVIndia and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy
p405
aVjust at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.
p406
aVTwo billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth
p407
aVbecause they didn't get this change,
p408
aVbecause they kept treating their people like serfs
p409
aVinstead of like shareholders of a common project.
p410
aVThey didn't keep the people who were educated.
p411
aVThey didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs.
p412
aVSilicon Valley did. And that's why they say
p413
aVthat Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs.
p414
aVNot integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese.
p415
aV(Laughter)
p416
aa(lp417
VHere's what's happening in the world.
p418
aVIt turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in 1950,
p419
aVwhen it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.
p420
aVIt turns out there's now about 192.
p421
aVCountry after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing \u2014
p422
aVand it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.
p423
aVIn the 1990s, these are sovereign states
p424
aVthat did not exist before 1990.
p425
aVAnd this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.
p426
aVWe're generating about 3.12 states per year.
p427
aVPeople are taking control of their own states,
p428
aVsometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.
p429
aVAnd the really interesting thing is,
p430
aVyou and your kids are empowered to build great empires,
p431
aVand you don't need a lot to do it.
p432
aV(Music)
p433
aVAnd, given that the music is over, I was going to talk
p434
aVabout how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,
p435
aVand how code works.
p436
aVModerator: Two minutes.
p437
aV(Laughter)
p438
aVJuan Enriquez: No, I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year
p439
aVbecause I don't want to take any of Laurie's time.
p440
aVBut thank you very much.

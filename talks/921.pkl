VUp until now, our communication with machines
p5
aVhas always been limited
p6
aVto conscious and direct forms.
p7
aVWhether it's something simple
p8
aVlike turning on the lights with a switch,
p9
aVor even as complex as programming robotics,
p10
aVwe have always had to give a command to a machine,
p11
aVor even a series of commands,
p12
aVin order for it to do something for us.
p13
aVCommunication between people, on the other hand,
p14
aVis far more complex and a lot more interesting
p15
aVbecause we take into account
p16
aVso much more than what is explicitly expressed.
p17
aVWe observe facial expressions, body language,
p18
aVand we can intuit feelings and emotions
p19
aVfrom our dialogue with one another.
p20
aVThis actually forms a large part
p21
aVof our decision-making process.
p22
aVOur vision is to introduce
p23
aVthis whole new realm of human interaction
p24
aVinto human-computer interaction
p25
aVso that computers can understand
p26
aVnot only what you direct it to do,
p27
aVbut it can also respond
p28
aVto your facial expressions
p29
aVand emotional experiences.
p30
aVAnd what better way to do this
p31
aVthan by interpreting the signals
p32
aVnaturally produced by our brain,
p33
aVour center for control and experience.
p34
aa(lp35
VWell, it sounds like a pretty good idea,
p36
aVbut this task, as Bruno mentioned,
p37
aVisn't an easy one for two main reasons:
p38
aVFirst, the detection algorithms.
p39
aVOur brain is made up of
p40
aVbillions of active neurons,
p41
aVaround 170,000 km
p42
aVof combined axon length.
p43
aVWhen these neurons interact,
p44
aVthe chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse,
p45
aVwhich can be measured.
p46
aVThe majority of our functional brain
p47
aVis distributed over
p48
aVthe outer surface layer of the brain,
p49
aVand to increase the area that's available for mental capacity,
p50
aVthe brain surface is highly folded.
p51
aVNow this cortical folding
p52
aVpresents a significant challenge
p53
aVfor interpreting surface electrical impulses.
p54
aVEach individual's cortex
p55
aVis folded differently,
p56
aVvery much like a fingerprint.
p57
aVSo even though a signal
p58
aVmay come from the same functional part of the brain,
p59
aVby the time the structure has been folded,
p60
aVits physical location
p61
aVis very different between individuals,
p62
aVeven identical twins.
p63
aVThere is no longer any consistency
p64
aVin the surface signals.
p65
aa(lp66
VOur breakthrough was to create an algorithm
p67
aVthat unfolds the cortex,
p68
aVso that we can map the signals
p69
aVcloser to its source,
p70
aVand therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.
p71
aVThe second challenge
p72
aVis the actual device for observing brainwaves.
p73
aVEEG measurements typically involve
p74
aVa hairnet with an array of sensors,
p75
aVlike the one that you can see here in the photo.
p76
aVA technician will put the electrodes
p77
aVonto the scalp
p78
aVusing a conductive gel or paste
p79
aVand usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp
p80
aVby light abrasion.
p81
aVNow this is quite time consuming
p82
aVand isn't the most comfortable process.
p83
aVAnd on top of that, these systems
p84
aVactually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo with that, I'd like to invite onstage
p87
aVEvan Grant, who is one of last year's speakers,
p88
aVwho's kindly agreed
p89
aVto help me to demonstrate
p90
aVwhat we've been able to develop.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VSo the device that you see
p95
aVis a 14-channel, high-fidelity
p96
aVEEG acquisition system.
p97
aVIt doesn't require any scalp preparation,
p98
aVno conductive gel or paste.
p99
aVIt only takes a few minutes to put on
p100
aVand for the signals to settle.
p101
aVIt's also wireless,
p102
aVso it gives you the freedom to move around.
p103
aVAnd compared to the tens of thousands of dollars
p104
aVfor a traditional EEG system,
p105
aVthis headset only costs
p106
aVa few hundred dollars.
p107
aVNow on to the detection algorithms.
p108
aVSo facial expressions \u2014
p109
aVas I mentioned before in emotional experiences \u2014
p110
aVare actually designed to work out of the box
p111
aVwith some sensitivity adjustments
p112
aVavailable for personalization.
p113
aVBut with the limited time we have available,
p114
aVI'd like to show you the cognitive suite,
p115
aVwhich is the ability for you
p116
aVto basically move virtual objects with your mind.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, Evan is new to this system,
p119
aVso what we have to do first
p120
aVis create a new profile for him.
p121
aVHe's obviously not Joanne \u2014 so we'll "add user."
p122
aVEvan. Okay.
p123
aVSo the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite
p124
aVis to start with training
p125
aVa neutral signal.
p126
aVWith neutral, there's nothing in particular
p127
aVthat Evan needs to do.
p128
aVHe just hangs out. He's relaxed.
p129
aVAnd the idea is to establish a baseline
p130
aVor normal state for his brain,
p131
aVbecause every brain is different.
p132
aVIt takes eight seconds to do this,
p133
aVand now that that's done,
p134
aVwe can choose a movement-based action.
p135
aVSo Evan, choose something
p136
aVthat you can visualize clearly in your mind.
p137
aa(lp138
VEvan Grant: Let's do "pull."
p139
aa(lp140
VTan Le: Okay, so let's choose "pull."
p141
aVSo the idea here now
p142
aVis that Evan needs to
p143
aVimagine the object coming forward
p144
aVinto the screen,
p145
aVand there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen
p146
aVwhile he's doing that.
p147
aVThe first time, nothing will happen,
p148
aVbecause the system has no idea how he thinks about "pull."
p149
aVBut maintain that thought
p150
aVfor the entire duration of the eight seconds.
p151
aVSo: one, two, three, go.
p152
aVOkay.
p153
aVSo once we accept this,
p154
aVthe cube is live.
p155
aVSo let's see if Evan
p156
aVcan actually try and imagine pulling.
p157
aVAh, good job!
p158
aV(Applause)
p159
aVThat's really amazing.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Applause)
p162
aa(lp163
VSo we have a little bit of time available,
p164
aVso I'm going to ask Evan
p165
aVto do a really difficult task.
p166
aVAnd this one is difficult
p167
aVbecause it's all about being able to visualize something
p168
aVthat doesn't exist in our physical world.
p169
aVThis is "disappear."
p170
aVSo what you want to do \u2014 at least with movement-based actions,
p171
aVwe do that all the time, so you can visualize it.
p172
aVBut with "disappear," there's really no analogies \u2014
p173
aVso Evan, what you want to do here
p174
aVis to imagine the cube slowly fading out, okay.
p175
aVSame sort of drill. So: one, two, three, go.
p176
aVOkay. Let's try that.
p177
aVOh, my goodness. He's just too good.
p178
aVLet's try that again.
p179
aa(lp180
VEG: Losing concentration.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VTL: But we can see that it actually works,
p185
aVeven though you can only hold it
p186
aVfor a little bit of time.
p187
aVAs I said, it's a very difficult process
p188
aVto imagine this.
p189
aVAnd the great thing about it is that
p190
aVwe've only given the software one instance
p191
aVof how he thinks about "disappear."
p192
aVAs there is a machine learning algorithm in this \u2014
p193
aa(lp194
V(Applause)
p195
aa(lp196
VThank you.
p197
aVGood job. Good job.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Applause)
p200
aa(lp201
VThank you, Evan, you're a wonderful, wonderful
p202
aVexample of the technology.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo, as you can see, before,
p205
aVthere is a leveling system built into this software
p206
aVso that as Evan, or any user,
p207
aVbecomes more familiar with the system,
p208
aVthey can continue to add more and more detections,
p209
aVso that the system begins to differentiate
p210
aVbetween different distinct thoughts.
p211
aVAnd once you've trained up the detections,
p212
aVthese thoughts can be assigned or mapped
p213
aVto any computing platform,
p214
aVapplication or device.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo I'd like to show you a few examples,
p217
aVbecause there are many possible applications
p218
aVfor this new interface.
p219
aVIn games and virtual worlds, for example,
p220
aVyour facial expressions
p221
aVcan naturally and intuitively be used
p222
aVto control an avatar or virtual character.
p223
aVObviously, you can experience the fantasy of magic
p224
aVand control the world with your mind.
p225
aVAnd also, colors, lighting,
p226
aVsound and effects
p227
aVcan dynamically respond to your emotional state
p228
aVto heighten the experience that you're having, in real time.
p229
aVAnd moving on to some applications
p230
aVdeveloped by developers and researchers around the world,
p231
aVwith robots and simple machines, for example \u2014
p232
aVin this case, flying a toy helicopter
p233
aVsimply by thinking "lift" with your mind.
p234
aa(lp235
VThe technology can also be applied
p236
aVto real world applications \u2014
p237
aVin this example, a smart home.
p238
aVYou know, from the user interface of the control system
p239
aVto opening curtains
p240
aVor closing curtains.
p241
aVAnd of course, also to the lighting \u2014
p242
aVturning them on
p243
aVor off.
p244
aVAnd finally,
p245
aVto real life-changing applications,
p246
aVsuch as being able to control an electric wheelchair.
p247
aVIn this example,
p248
aVfacial expressions are mapped to the movement commands.
p249
aa(lp250
VMan: Now blink right to go right.
p251
aVNow blink left to turn back left.
p252
aVNow smile to go straight.
p253
aa(lp254
VTL: We really \u2014 Thank you.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VWe are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today,
p259
aVand with the community's input,
p260
aVand also with the involvement of developers
p261
aVand researchers from around the world,
p262
aVwe hope that you can help us to shape
p263
aVwhere the technology goes from here. Thank you so much.

VI would like to talk today
p5
aVabout what I think is one of the greatest adventures
p6
aVhuman beings have embarked upon,
p7
aVwhich is the quest to understand the universe
p8
aVand our place in it.
p9
aVMy own interest in this subject, and my passion for it,
p10
aVbegan rather accidentally.
p11
aVI had bought a copy of this book,
p12
aV"The Universe and Dr. Einstein" \u2014
p13
aVa used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.
p14
aVA few years after that, in Bangalore,
p15
aVI was finding it hard to fall asleep one night,
p16
aVand I picked up this book,
p17
aVthinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.
p18
aVAnd as it happened,
p19
aVI read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.
p20
aVAnd I was left with this intense feeling
p21
aVof awe and exhilaration
p22
aVat the universe
p23
aVand our own ability to understand as much as we do.
p24
aVAnd that feeling hasn't left me yet.
p25
aa(lp26
VThat feeling was the trigger for me
p27
aVto actually change my career \u2014
p28
aVfrom being a software engineer to become a science writer \u2014
p29
aVso that I could partake in the joy of science,
p30
aVand also the joy of communicating it to others.
p31
aVAnd that feeling also led me
p32
aVto a pilgrimage of sorts,
p33
aVto go literally to the ends of the earth
p34
aVto see telescopes, detectors,
p35
aVinstruments that people are building, or have built,
p36
aVin order to probe the cosmos
p37
aVin greater and greater detail.
p38
aVSo it took me from places like Chile \u2014
p39
aVthe Atacama Desert in Chile \u2014
p40
aVto Siberia,
p41
aVto underground mines
p42
aVin the Japanese Alps, in Northern America,
p43
aVall the way to Antarctica
p44
aVand even to the South Pole.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd today I would like to share with you
p47
aVsome images, some stories of these trips.
p48
aVI have been basically spending the last few years
p49
aVdocumenting the efforts
p50
aVof some extremely intrepid men and women
p51
aVwho are putting,
p52
aVliterally at times, their lives at stake
p53
aVworking in some very remote and very hostile places
p54
aVso that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos
p55
aVin order for us to understand this universe.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd I first begin with a pie chart \u2014
p58
aVand I promise this is the only pie chart
p59
aVin the whole presentation \u2014
p60
aVbut it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos.
p61
aVAll the theories in physics that we have today
p62
aVproperly explain what is called normal matter \u2014
p63
aVthe stuff that we're all made of \u2014
p64
aVand that's four percent of the universe.
p65
aVAstronomers and cosmologists and physicists think
p66
aVthat there is something called dark matter in the universe,
p67
aVwhich makes up 23 percent of the universe,
p68
aVand something called dark energy,
p69
aVwhich permeates the fabric of space-time,
p70
aVthat makes up another 73 percent.
p71
aVSo if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe,
p72
aVat this point in our exploration of it,
p73
aVis unknown or not well understood.
p74
aVAnd most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see
p75
aVare in some way addressing this question,
p76
aVthese two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.
p77
aa(lp78
VI will take you first to an underground mine
p79
aVin Northern Minnesota
p80
aVwhere people are looking
p81
aVfor something called dark matter.
p82
aVAnd the idea here is that they are looking for a sign
p83
aVof a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors.
p84
aVAnd the reason why they have to go underground
p85
aVis that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth,
p86
aVthe same experiment would be swamped by signals
p87
aVthat could be created by things like cosmic rays,
p88
aVambient radio activity,
p89
aVeven our own bodies. You might not believe it,
p90
aVbut even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment.
p91
aVSo they go deep inside mines
p92
aVto find a kind of environmental silence
p93
aVthat will allow them to hear
p94
aVthe ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd I went to see one of these experiments,
p97
aVand this is actually \u2014 you can barely see it,
p98
aVand the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there \u2014
p99
aVthis is a cavern that was left behind by the miners
p100
aVwho left this mine in 1960.
p101
aVAnd physicists came and started using it
p102
aVsometime in the 1980s.
p103
aVAnd the miners in the early part of the last century
p104
aVworked, literally, in candlelight.
p105
aVAnd today, you would see this inside the mine,
p106
aVhalf a mile underground.
p107
aVThis is one of the largest underground labs in the world.
p108
aVAnd, among other things, they're looking for dark matter.
p109
aa(lp110
VThere is another way to search for dark matter,
p111
aVwhich is indirectly.
p112
aVIf dark matter exists in our universe,
p113
aVin our galaxy,
p114
aVthen these particles should be smashing together
p115
aVand producing other particles that we know about \u2014
p116
aVone of them being neutrinos.
p117
aVAnd neutrinos you can detect
p118
aVby the signature they leave
p119
aVwhen they hit water molecules.
p120
aVWhen a neutrino hits a water molecule
p121
aVit emits a kind of blue light,
p122
aVa flash of blue light,
p123
aVand by looking for this blue light,
p124
aVyou can essentially understand something about the neutrino
p125
aVand then, indirectly, something about the dark matter
p126
aVthat might have created this neutrino.
p127
aVBut you need very, very large volumes of water
p128
aVin order to do this.
p129
aVYou need something like tens of megatons of water \u2014
p130
aValmost a gigaton of water \u2014
p131
aVin order to have any chance of catching this neutrino.
p132
aVAnd where in the world would you find such water?
p133
aVWell the Russians have a tank in their own backyard.
p134
aa(lp135
VThis is Lake Baikal.
p136
aVIt is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long.
p137
aVIt's about 40 to 50 km wide
p138
aVin most places,
p139
aVand one to two kilometers deep.
p140
aVAnd what the Russians are doing
p141
aVis they're building these detectors
p142
aVand immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake
p143
aVso that they can watch for these flashes of blue light.
p144
aVAnd this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there.
p145
aVThis is Lake Baikal
p146
aVin the peak of the Siberian winter.
p147
aVThe lake is entirely frozen.
p148
aVAnd the line of black dots
p149
aVthat you see in the background,
p150
aVthat's the ice camp where the physicists are working.
p151
aVThe reason why they have to work in winter
p152
aVis because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring,
p153
aVwhich, if they did that,
p154
aVthey would need ships and submersibles to do their work.
p155
aVSo they wait until winter \u2014
p156
aVthe lake is completely frozen over \u2014
p157
aVand they use this meter-thick ice
p158
aVas a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo this is the Russians working on the ice
p161
aVin the peak of the Siberian winter.
p162
aVThey have to drill holes in the ice,
p163
aVdive down into the water \u2014 cold, cold water \u2014
p164
aVto get hold of the instrument, bring it up,
p165
aVdo any repairs and maintenance that they need to do,
p166
aVput it back and get out before the ice melts.
p167
aVBecause that phase of solid ice lasts for two months
p168
aVand it's full of cracks.
p169
aVAnd you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake
p170
aVunderneath, moving.
p171
aVI still don't understand this one Russian man
p172
aVworking in his bare chest,
p173
aVbut that tells you how hard he was working.
p174
aVAnd these people, a handful of people,
p175
aVhave been working for 20 years,
p176
aVlooking for particles that may or may not exist.
p177
aVAnd they have dedicated their lives to it.
p178
aVAnd just to give you an idea,
p179
aVthey have spent 20 million over 20 years.
p180
aVIt's very harsh conditions.
p181
aVThey work on a shoestring budget.
p182
aVThe toilets there are literally holes in the ground
p183
aVcovered with a wooden shack.
p184
aVAnd it's that basic,
p185
aVbut they do this every year.
p186
aa(lp187
VFrom Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile,
p188
aVto see something called The Very Large Telescope.
p189
aVThe Very Large Telescope
p190
aVis one of these things that astronomers do \u2014
p191
aVthey name their telescopes rather unimaginatively.
p192
aVI can tell you for a fact,
p193
aVthat the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVAnd you wouldn't believe it,
p196
aVbut the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope.
p197
aVBut nonetheless,
p198
aVit's an extraordinary piece of engineering.
p199
aVThese are four 8.2 meter telescopes.
p200
aVAnd these telescopes, among other things,
p201
aVthey're being used to study
p202
aVhow the expansion of the universe is changing with time.
p203
aVAnd the more you understand that,
p204
aVthe better you would understand
p205
aVwhat this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with
p208
aVas regards this telescope
p209
aVis the mirror.
p210
aVEach mirror, there are four of them,
p211
aVis made of a single piece of glass,
p212
aVa monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic,
p213
aVthat has been ground down and polished to such accuracy
p214
aVthat the only way to understand what that is
p215
aVis [to] imagine a city like Paris,
p216
aVwith all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower,
p217
aVif you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy,
p218
aVyou would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high.
p219
aVAnd that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured.
p220
aVAn extraordinary set of telescopes.
p221
aVHere's another view of the same.
p222
aVThe reason why you have to build these telescopes
p223
aVin places like the Atacama Desert
p224
aVis because of the high altitude desert.
p225
aVThe dry air is really good for telescopes,
p226
aVand also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains
p227
aVso that the telescopes have
p228
aVabout 300 days of clear skies.
p229
aa(lp230
VFinally, I want to take you to Antarctica.
p231
aVI want to spend most of my time on this part of the world.
p232
aVThis is cosmology's final frontier.
p233
aVSome of the most amazing experiments,
p234
aVsome of the most extreme experiments,
p235
aVare being done in Antarctica.
p236
aVI was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight,
p237
aVwhich basically takes telescopes and instruments
p238
aVall the way to the upper atmosphere,
p239
aVthe upper stratosphere, 40 km up.
p240
aVAnd that's where they do their experiments,
p241
aVand then the balloon, the payload, is brought down.
p242
aVSo this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.
p243
aVThat's an American C-17 cargo plane
p244
aVthat flew us from New Zealand
p245
aVto McMurdo in Antarctica.
p246
aVAnd here we are about to board our bus.
p247
aVAnd I don't know if you can read the lettering,
p248
aVbut it says, "Ivan the Terribus."
p249
aVAnd that's taking us to McMurdo.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo.
p252
aVAnd you barely might be able to make out
p253
aVthis hut here.
p254
aVThis hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men
p255
aVwhen they first came to Antarctica
p256
aVon their first expedition to go to the South Pole.
p257
aVBecause it's so cold,
p258
aVthe entire contents of that hut is still as they left it,
p259
aVwith the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there.
p260
aVIt's an extraordinary place.
p261
aVThis is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer,
p262
aVand about 200 in winter
p263
aVwhen it's completely dark for six months.
p264
aa(lp265
VI was here to see the launch
p266
aVof this particular type of instrument.
p267
aVThis is a cosmic ray experiment
p268
aVthat has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere
p269
aVto an altitude of 40 km.
p270
aVWhat I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight.
p271
aVSo you're using a balloon
p272
aVto carry something that is two tons
p273
aVall the way to an altitude of 40 km.
p274
aVAnd the engineers, the technicians, the physicists
p275
aVhave all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf,
p276
aVbecause Antarctica \u2014 I won't go into the reasons why \u2014
p277
aVbut it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches,
p278
aVexcept for the weather.
p279
aVThe weather, as you can imagine,
p280
aVthis is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice.
p281
aVAnd there's a volcano behind,
p282
aVwhich has glaciers at the very top.
p283
aVAnd what they have to do
p284
aVis they have to assemble the entire balloon \u2014
p285
aVthe fabric, parachute and everything \u2014 on the ice
p286
aVand then fill it up with helium.
p287
aVAnd that process takes about two hours.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly.
p290
aVFor instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind,
p291
aVwhich is eventually going to be filled up with helium.
p292
aVThose two trucks you see at the very end
p293
aVcarry 12 tanks each of compressed helium.
p294
aVNow, in case the weather changes before the launch,
p295
aVthey have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes
p296
aVand take it out back to McMurdo Station.
p297
aVAnd this particular balloon,
p298
aVbecause it has to launch two tons of weight,
p299
aVis an extremely huge balloon.
p300
aVThe fabric alone weighs two tons.
p301
aVIn order to minimize the weight,
p302
aVit's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.
p303
aVAnd if they have to pack it back,
p304
aVthey have to put it into boxes
p305
aVand stamp on it so that it fits into the box again \u2014
p306
aVexcept, when they did it first,
p307
aVit would have been done in Texas.
p308
aVHere, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing,
p309
aVso they have to take their shoes off,
p310
aVget barefoot into the boxes, in this cold,
p311
aVand do that kind of work.
p312
aVThat's the kind of dedication these people have.
p313
aa(lp314
VHere's the balloon being filled up with helium,
p315
aVand you can see it's a gorgeous sight.
p316
aVHere's a scene
p317
aVthat shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end.
p318
aVSo the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side,
p319
aVand the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle
p320
aVwhere there's a piece of electronics and explosives
p321
aVbeing connected to a parachute,
p322
aVand then the parachute is then connected to the payload.
p323
aVAnd remember, all this wiring is being done
p324
aVby people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures.
p325
aVThey're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff,
p326
aVbut they have to take their gloves off in order to do that.
p327
aVAnd I would like to share with you a launch.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon,
p330
aVrelease the balloon, release the balloon.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images.
p333
aVThis is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India.
p334
aVAnd the thing I want you to look at here
p335
aVis the telescope on the right-hand side.
p336
aVAnd on the far left there
p337
aVis a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery.
p338
aVThis is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery.
p339
aVAnd I was struck by the juxtaposition
p340
aVof these two enormous disciplines that humanity has.
p341
aVOne is exploring the cosmos on the outside,
p342
aVand the other one is exploring our interior being.
p343
aVAnd both require silence of some sort.
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd what struck me was
p346
aVevery place that I went to to see these telescopes,
p347
aVthe astronomers and cosmologists
p348
aVare in search of a certain kind of silence,
p349
aVwhether it's silence from radio pollution
p350
aVor light pollution or whatever.
p351
aVAnd it was very obvious
p352
aVthat, if we destroy these silent places on Earth,
p353
aVwe will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards,
p354
aVbecause we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space.
p355
aa(lp356
VThank you.
p357
aa(lp358

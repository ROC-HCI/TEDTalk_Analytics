VYou know for me, the interest in contemporary forms of slavery
p5
aVstarted with a leaflet that I picked up in London.
p6
aVIt was the early '90s,
p7
aVand I was at a public event.
p8
aVI saw this leaflet and it said,
p9
aV"There are millions of slaves in the world today."
p10
aVAnd I thought, "No way, no way."
p11
aVAnd I'm going to admit to hubris.
p12
aVBecause I also, I'm going to admit to you,
p13
aVI also thought, "How can I be like
p14
aVa hot-shot young full professor
p15
aVwho teaches human rights and not know this?
p16
aVSo it can't be true."
p17
aa(lp18
VWell, if you teach, if you worship
p19
aVin the temple of learning,
p20
aVdo not mock the gods,
p21
aVbecause they will take you,
p22
aVfill you with curiosity and desire,
p23
aVand drive you. Drive you with a passion
p24
aVto change things.
p25
aVI went out and did a lit review,
p26
aV3,000 articles on the key word "slavery."
p27
aVTwo turned out to be about contemporary \u2014 only two.
p28
aVAll the rest were historical.
p29
aVThey were press pieces and they were full of outrage,
p30
aVthey were full of speculation, they were anecdotal \u2014
p31
aVno solid information.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo, I began to do a research project of my own.
p34
aVI went to five countries around the world.
p35
aVI looked at slaves. I met slaveholders,
p36
aVand I looked very deeply
p37
aVinto slave-based businesses
p38
aVbecause this is an economic crime.
p39
aVPeople do not enslave people to be mean to them.
p40
aVThey do it to make a profit.
p41
aVAnd I've got to tell you, what I found out in the world
p42
aVin four different continents,
p43
aVwas depressingly familiar.
p44
aVLike this:
p45
aVAgricultural workers in Africa,
p46
aVwhipped and beaten,
p47
aVshowing us how they were beaten in the fields
p48
aVbefore they escaped from slavery
p49
aVand met up with our film crew.
p50
aVIt was mind-blowing.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd I want to be very clear.
p53
aVI'm talking about real slavery.
p54
aVThis is not about lousy marriages,
p55
aVthis is not about jobs that suck.
p56
aVThis is about people who can not walk away,
p57
aVpeople who are forced to work without pay,
p58
aVpeople who are operating 24/7
p59
aVunder a threat of violence
p60
aVand have no pay.
p61
aVIt's real slavery in exactly the same way
p62
aVthat slavery would be recognized
p63
aVthroughout all of human history.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, where is it?
p66
aVWell, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colors
p67
aVare the places with the highest densities of slavery.
p68
aVBut in fact that kind of bluey color
p69
aVare the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery.
p70
aVAnd you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland
p71
aVwhere we can't find any cases of enslavement
p72
aVaround the world.
p73
aa(lp74
VWe're also particularly interested
p75
aVand looking very carefully
p76
aVat places where
p77
aVslaves are being used to perpetrate
p78
aVextreme environmental destruction.
p79
aVAround the world, slaves are used to destroy the environment,
p80
aVcutting down trees in the Amazon; destroying
p81
aVforest areas in West Africa;
p82
aVmining and spreading mercury around
p83
aVin places like Ghana and the Congo;
p84
aVdestroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia.
p85
aVIt's a pretty harrowing linkage
p86
aVbetween what's happening to our environment
p87
aVand what's happening to our human rights.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this,
p90
aVwhere we have 27 million people
p91
aVin slavery in the year 2010?
p92
aVThat's double the number that came out of Africa
p93
aVin the entire transatlantic slave trade.
p94
aVWell, it builds up with these factors.
p95
aVThey are not causal, they are actually supporting factors.
p96
aVOne we all know about, the population explosion:
p97
aVthe world goes from two billion people to almost
p98
aVseven billion people in the last 50 years.
p99
aVBeing numerous does not make you a slave.
p100
aVAdd in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people
p101
aVin the developing world,
p102
aVcaused by civil wars, ethnic conflicts,
p103
aVkleptocratic governments, disease ... you name it, you know it.
p104
aa(lp105
VWe understand how that works. In some countries
p106
aVall of those things happen at once,
p107
aVlike Sierra Leone a few years ago,
p108
aVand push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact,
p109
aVas we know, live on the edge,
p110
aVlive in situations where
p111
aVthey don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute.
p112
aVBut that doesn't make you a slave either.
p113
aVWhat it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable
p114
aVinto a slave, is the absence of the rule of law.
p115
aVIf the rule of law is sound, it protects
p116
aVthe poor and it protects the vulnerable.
p117
aVBut if corruption creeps in
p118
aVand people don't have the opportunity
p119
aVto have that protection of the rule of law,
p120
aVthen if you can use violence,
p121
aVif you can use violence with impunity,
p122
aVyou can reach out and harvest the vulnerable
p123
aVinto slavery.
p124
aa(lp125
VWell, that is precisely what has happened around the world.
p126
aVThough, for a lot of people,
p127
aVthe people who step
p128
aVinto slavery today
p129
aVdon't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head.
p130
aVThey come into slavery because
p131
aVsomeone has asked them this question.
p132
aa(lp133
VAll around the world I've been told an almost identical story.
p134
aVPeople say, "I was home,
p135
aVsomeone came into our village,
p136
aVthey stood up in the back of a truck, they said, 'I've got jobs,
p137
aVwho needs a job?'"
p138
aVAnd they did exactly what
p139
aVyou or I would do in the same situation.
p140
aVThey said, "That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious,
p141
aVbut my children were hungry.
p142
aVWe needed medicine.
p143
aVI knew I had to do anything I could
p144
aVto earn some money to support the people I care about."
p145
aVThey climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them.
p146
aVTen miles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles later,
p147
aVthey find themselves in dirty, dangerous, demeaning work.
p148
aVThey take it for a little while,
p149
aVbut when they try to leave, bang!, the hammer comes down,
p150
aVand they discover they're enslaved.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, that kind of slavery
p153
aVis, again, pretty much what slavery has been all through human history.
p154
aVBut there is one thing that is particularly remarkable
p155
aVand novel about slavery today,
p156
aVand that is a complete collapse
p157
aVin the price of human beings \u2014
p158
aVexpensive in the past, dirt cheap now.
p159
aVEven the business programs have started
p160
aVpicking up on this.
p161
aVI just want to share a little clip for you.
p162
aa(lp163
VDaphne: OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here, as always,
p164
aVas we get macro and talk commodities.
p165
aVContinuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue,
p166
aVhead of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management.
p167
aVAnd we're also joined by Brent Lawson
p168
aVfrom Lawson Frisk Securities.
p169
aa(lp170
VBrent Lawson: Happy to be here.
p171
aa(lp172
VD: Good to have you with us, Brent.
p173
aVNow, gentlemen ... Brent, where is your money going this year?
p174
aa(lp175
VBL: Well Daphne, we've been going short on gas and oil recently
p176
aVand casting our net just a little bit wider.
p177
aVWe really like the human being story a lot.
p178
aVIf you look at a long-term chart,
p179
aVprices are at historical lows and yet global demand
p180
aVfor forced labor is still real strong.
p181
aVSo, that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on.
p182
aa(lp183
VD: Michael, what's your take on the people story? Are you interested?
p184
aa(lp185
VMichael O'Donoghue: Oh definitely. Non-voluntary labor's greatest advantage
p186
aVas an asset is the endless supply.
p187
aVWe're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that.
p188
aa(lp189
VBL: Daphne, if I may draw your attention to one thing.
p190
aVThat is that private equity has been sniffing around,
p191
aVand that tells me that this market is about to explode.
p192
aVAfricans and Indians, as usual,
p193
aVSouth Americans, and Eastern Europeans in particular
p194
aVare on our buy list.
p195
aa(lp196
VD: Interesting. Micheal, bottom line, what do you recommend?
p197
aa(lp198
VMO: We're recommending to our clients
p199
aVa buy and hold strategy.
p200
aVThere's no need to play the market.
p201
aVThere's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting.
p202
aa(lp203
VD: Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen, thank you very much.
p204
aa(lp205
VKevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof.
p206
aVThough I enjoyed watching
p207
aVyour jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it.
p208
aVMTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof,
p209
aVand they've been slipping it in between music videos
p210
aVwithout any introduction, which I think is kind of fun.
p211
aVHere's the reality.
p212
aVThe price of human beings across the last 4,000 years
p213
aVin today's money has averaged about 40,000 dollars.
p214
aVCapital purchase items.
p215
aVYou can see that the lines cross when the population explodes.
p216
aa(lp217
VThe average price of a human being today,
p218
aVaround the world, is about 90 dollars.
p219
aVThey are more expensive in places like North America.
p220
aVSlaves cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars in North America,
p221
aVbut I could take you places in India or Nepal
p222
aVwhere human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars.
p223
aVThey key here is that
p224
aVpeople have ceased to be that capital purchase item
p225
aVand become like Styrofoam cups.
p226
aVYou buy them cheaply, you use them,
p227
aVyou crumple them up, and then when you're done
p228
aVwith them you just throw them away.
p229
aa(lp230
VThese young boys are in Nepal.
p231
aVThey are basically the transport system
p232
aVon a quarry run by a slaveholder.
p233
aVThere are no roads there, so they carry loads of stone
p234
aVon their backs, often of their own weight,
p235
aVup and down the Himalaya Mountains.
p236
aVOne of their mothers said to us,
p237
aV"You know, we can't survive here,
p238
aVbut we can't even seem to die either."
p239
aVIt's a horrible situation.
p240
aVAnd if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this,
p241
aVit's that there are also \u2014
p242
aVin addition to young men like this who are still enslaved \u2014
p243
aVthere are ex-slaves who are now working to free others.
p244
aVOr, we say, Frederick Douglass is in the house.
p245
aa(lp246
VI don't know if you've ever had a daydream
p247
aVabout, "Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman?
p248
aVWhat would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass?"
p249
aVI've got to say, one of the most exciting parts about my job
p250
aVis that I get to,
p251
aVand I want to introduce you to one of those.
p252
aVHis name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana
p253
aVenslaved in the fishing industry,
p254
aVand he now, after escape and building a new life,
p255
aVhas formed an organization that we work closely with
p256
aVto go back and get people out of slavery.
p257
aVThis is not James, this is one of the kids that he works with.
p258
aa(lp259
VJames Kofi Annan (Video): He was hit with a paddle
p260
aVin the head. And this reminds me
p261
aVof my childhood when I used to work here.
p262
aa(lp263
VKB: James and our country director in Ghana,
p264
aVEmmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats
p265
aVbecause the two of them managed to get
p266
aVconvictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers
p267
aVfor the very first time in Ghana
p268
aVfor enslaving people, from the fishing industry,
p269
aVfor enslaving children.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow, everything I've been telling you,
p272
aVI admit, is pretty disheartening.
p273
aVBut there is actually a very positive side to this,
p274
aVand that is this: The 27 million people
p275
aVwho are in slavery today,
p276
aVthat's a lot of people, but it's also
p277
aVthe smallest fraction
p278
aVof the global population to ever be in slavery.
p279
aVAnd likewise, the 40 billion dollars that they generate
p280
aVinto the global economy each year
p281
aVis the tiniest proportion of the global economy
p282
aVto ever be represented by slave labor.
p283
aa(lp284
VSlavery, illegal in every country
p285
aVhas been pushed to the edges of our global society.
p286
aVAnd in a way, without us even noticing,
p287
aVhas ended up standing on the precipice
p288
aVof its own extinction,
p289
aVwaiting for us to give it a big boot
p290
aVand knock it over. And get rid of it.
p291
aVAnd it can be done.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow, if we do that, if we put the resources
p294
aVand the focus to it,
p295
aVwhat does it actually cost to get people out of slavery?
p296
aVWell, first, before I even tell you the cost
p297
aVI've got to be absolutely clear.
p298
aVWe do not buy people out of slavery.
p299
aVBuying people out of slavery is like
p300
aVpaying a burglar to get your television back;
p301
aVit's abetting a crime.
p302
aVLiberation, however, costs some money.
p303
aa(lp304
VLiberation, and more importantly
p305
aVall the work that comes after liberation.
p306
aVIt's not an event, it's a process.
p307
aVIt's about helping people to build lives of dignity,
p308
aVstability, economic autonomy,
p309
aVcitizenship.
p310
aVWell, amazingly,
p311
aVin places like India where costs are very low,
p312
aVthat family, that three-generation family that you see there
p313
aVwho were in hereditary slavery \u2014
p314
aVso, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery \u2014
p315
aVbut the total cost, amortized
p316
aVacross the rest of the work,
p317
aVwas about 150 dollars to bring that family
p318
aVout of slavery and then take them through a two year process
p319
aVto build a stable life of citizenship and education.
p320
aa(lp321
VA boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery, about 400 dollars.
p322
aVIn the United States, North America,
p323
aVmuch more expensive. Legal costs, medical costs ...
p324
aVwe understand that it's expensive here:
p325
aVabout 30,000 dollars.
p326
aVBut most of the people in the world in slavery
p327
aVlive in those places where
p328
aVthe costs are lowest.
p329
aVAnd in fact, the global average is about what it is
p330
aVfor Ghana.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd that means, when you multiply it up,
p333
aVthe estimated cost of
p334
aVnot just freedom but sustainable freedom
p335
aVfor the entire 27 million people on the planet in slavery
p336
aVis something like 10.8 billion dollars \u2014
p337
aVwhat Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels,
p338
aVwhat Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system:
p339
aVusually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans,
p340
aVor in the last holiday period
p341
aVwhen we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people,
p342
aVwe spent 10.8 billion dollars.
p343
aVIntel's fourth quarter earnings: 10.8 billion.
p344
aa(lp345
VIt's not a lot of money at the global level.
p346
aVIn fact, it's peanuts.
p347
aVAnd the great thing about it is that
p348
aVit's not money down a hole,
p349
aVthere is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery
p350
aVto work for themselves,
p351
aVare they motivated?
p352
aVThey take their kids out of the workplace,
p353
aVthey build a school, they say,
p354
aV"We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares,
p355
aVmedicine when we're sick,
p356
aVclothing when we're cold."
p357
aVThey become consumers and producers
p358
aVand local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly.
p359
aa(lp360
VThat's important, all of that
p361
aVabout how we rebuild sustainable freedom,
p362
aVbecause we'd never want to repeat
p363
aVwhat happened in this country in 1865.
p364
aVFour million people were lifted up out of slavery
p365
aVand then dumped.
p366
aVDumped without political participation,
p367
aVdecent education,
p368
aVany kind of real opportunity
p369
aVin terms of economic lives,
p370
aVand then sentenced to generations of
p371
aVviolence and prejudice and discrimination.
p372
aVAnd America is still paying the price
p373
aVfor the botched emancipation of 1865.
p374
aa(lp375
VWe have made a commitment
p376
aVthat we will never let people
p377
aVcome out of slavery on our watch,
p378
aVand end up as second class citizens.
p379
aVIt's just not going to happen.
p380
aVThis is what liberation really looks like.
p381
aVChildren rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana,
p382
aVreunited with their parents,
p383
aVand then taken with their parents back to their villages
p384
aVto rebuild their economic well-being
p385
aVso that they become slave-proof \u2014
p386
aVabsolutely unenslaveable.
p387
aa(lp388
VNow, this woman
p389
aVlived in a village in Nepal.
p390
aVWe'd been working there about a month.
p391
aVThey had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery.
p392
aVThey'd just begun to light up a little bit,
p393
aVopen up a little bit.
p394
aVBut when we went to speak with her, when we took this photograph,
p395
aVthe slaveholders were still menacing us
p396
aVfrom the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back.
p397
aVI was frightened. We were frightened.
p398
aVWe said to her, "Are you worried? Are you upset?"
p399
aa(lp400
VShe said, "No, because we've got hope now.
p401
aVHow could we not succeed," she said,
p402
aV"when people like you from the other side of the world
p403
aVare coming here to stand beside us?"
p404
aa(lp405
VOkay, we have to ask ourselves,
p406
aVare we willing to live in a world with slavery?
p407
aVIf we don't take action, we just leave ourselves open
p408
aVto have someone else jerk the strings
p409
aVthat tie us to slavery in the products we buy,
p410
aVand in our government policies.
p411
aVAnd yet, if there's one thing that every human being can agree on,
p412
aVI think it's that slavery should end.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd if there is a fundamental violation
p415
aVof our human dignity
p416
aVthat we would all say is horrific,
p417
aVit's slavery.
p418
aVAnd we've got to say,
p419
aVwhat good is all of our intellectual
p420
aVand political and economic power \u2014
p421
aVand I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room \u2014
p422
aVif we can't use it to bring slavery to an end?
p423
aVI think there is enough intellectual power in this room
p424
aVto bring slavery to an end.
p425
aVAnd you know what? If we can't do that,
p426
aVif we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery,
p427
aVthere is one last question:
p428
aVAre we truly free?
p429
aVOkay, thank you so much.

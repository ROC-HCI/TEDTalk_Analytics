VNow, extinction is a different kind of death.
p5
aVIt's bigger.
p6
aVWe didn't really realize that until 1914,
p7
aVwhen the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha,
p8
aVdied at the Cincinnati zoo.
p9
aVThis had been the most abundant bird in the world
p10
aVthat'd been in North America for six million years.
p11
aVSuddenly it wasn't here at all.
p12
aVFlocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long
p13
aVused to darken the sun.
p14
aVAldo Leopold said this was a biological storm,
p15
aVa feathered tempest.
p16
aVAnd indeed it was a keystone species
p17
aVthat enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest,
p18
aVfrom the Mississippi to the Atlantic,
p19
aVfrom Canada down to the Gulf.
p20
aVBut it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades.
p21
aVWhat happened?
p22
aa(lp23
VWell, commercial hunting happened.
p24
aVThese birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton,
p25
aVand it was easy to do because when those big flocks
p26
aVcame down to the ground, they were so dense
p27
aVthat hundreds of hunters and netters could show up
p28
aVand slaughter them by the tens of thousands.
p29
aVIt was the cheapest source of protein in America.
p30
aVBy the end of the century, there was nothing left
p31
aVbut these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers.
p32
aa(lp33
VThere's an upside to the story.
p34
aVThis made people realize that the same thing
p35
aVwas about to happen to the American bison,
p36
aVand so these birds saved the buffalos.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut a lot of other animals weren't saved.
p39
aVThe Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere.
p40
aVIt was hunted to death for its feathers.
p41
aVThere was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen.
p42
aVIt was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway.
p43
aVA local newspaper spelled out, "There is no survivor,
p44
aVthere is no future, there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again."
p45
aVThere's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things,
p46
aVand it happened to lots of birds that people loved.
p47
aVIt happened to lots of mammals.
p48
aVAnother keystone species is a famous animal
p49
aVcalled the European aurochs.
p50
aVThere was sort of a movie made about it recently.
p51
aVAnd the aurochs was like the bison.
p52
aVThis was an animal that basically kept the forest
p53
aVmixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent,
p54
aVfrom Spain to Korea.
p55
aVThe documentation of this animal goes back
p56
aVto the Lascaux cave paintings.
p57
aa(lp58
VThe extinctions still go on.
p59
aVThere's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo.
p60
aVIt went extinct in 2000.
p61
aVThere was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolf
p62
aVcalled the thylacine in Tasmania, south of Australia,
p63
aVcalled the Tasmanian tiger.
p64
aVIt was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos.
p65
aVA little bit of film was shot.
p66
aa(lp67
VSorrow, anger, mourning.
p68
aVDon't mourn. Organize.
p69
aVWhat if you could find out that, using the DNA in museum specimens,
p70
aVfossils maybe up to 200,000 years old
p71
aVcould be used to bring species back,
p72
aVwhat would you do? Where would you start?
p73
aa(lp74
VWell, you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there.
p75
aVI started with my wife, Ryan Phelan,
p76
aVwho ran a biotech business called DNA Direct,
p77
aVand through her, one of her colleagues, George Church,
p78
aVone of the leading genetic engineers
p79
aVwho turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons
p80
aVand a lot of confidence
p81
aVthat methodologies he was working on
p82
aVmight actually do the deed.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting
p85
aVat the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together
p86
aVspecialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists,
p87
aVand fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced
p88
aVby a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro.
p89
aVAll she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian
p90
aVwas a little bit of toe pad tissue,
p91
aVbecause down in there is what is called ancient DNA.
p92
aVIt's DNA which is pretty badly fragmented,
p93
aVbut with good techniques now, you can basically reassemble the whole genome.
p94
aa(lp95
VThen the question is, can you reassemble,
p96
aVwith that genome, the whole bird?
p97
aVGeorge Church thinks you can.
p98
aVSo in his book, "Regenesis," which I recommend,
p99
aVhe has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species,
p100
aVand he has a machine called
p101
aVthe Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine.
p102
aVIt's kind of like an evolution machine.
p103
aVYou try combinations of genes that you write
p104
aVat the cell level and then in organs on a chip,
p105
aVand the ones that win, that you can then put
p106
aVinto a living organism. It'll work.
p107
aVThe precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides,
p108
aVnevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here
p109
aVright down to the individual base pair.
p110
aVThe passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo what you're getting is the capability now
p113
aVof replacing one gene with another variation of that gene.
p114
aVIt's called an allele.
p115
aVWell that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway.
p116
aVSo this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome
p117
aVof an extinct species
p118
aVwith the genome of its closest living relative.
p119
aVNow along the way, George points out that
p120
aVhis technology, the technology of synthetic biology,
p121
aVis currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore's Law.
p122
aVIt's been doing that since 2005, and it's likely to continue.
p123
aa(lp124
VOkay, the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon
p125
aVis the band-tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here.
p126
aVGenetically, the band-tailed pigeon already is
p127
aVmostly living passenger pigeon.
p128
aVThere's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon.
p129
aVIf you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits,
p130
aVyou've got the extinct bird back, cooing at you.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, there's work to do.
p133
aVYou have to figure out exactly what genes matter.
p134
aVSo there's genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon,
p135
aVgenes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon,
p136
aVand so on with the red eye, peach-colored breast, flocking, and so on.
p137
aVAdd them all up and the result won't be perfect.
p138
aVBut it should be be perfect enough,
p139
aVbecause nature doesn't do perfect either.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo this meeting in Boston led to three things.
p142
aa(lp143
VFirst off, Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit
p144
aVcalled Revive and Restore that would push de-extinction generally
p145
aVand try to have it go in a responsible way,
p146
aVand we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnother direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak,
p149
aVwho had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14
p150
aVand had also learned how to work with ancient DNA,
p151
aVhimself sequenced the passenger pigeon,
p152
aVusing money from his family and friends.
p153
aVWe hired him full-time.
p154
aVNow, this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian,
p155
aVhe's looking down at Martha,
p156
aVthe last passenger pigeon alive.
p157
aVSo if he's successful, she won't be the last.
p158
aa(lp159
VThe third result of the Boston meeting was the realization
p160
aVthat there are scientists all over the world
p161
aVworking on various forms of de-extinction,
p162
aVbut they'd never met each other.
p163
aVAnd National Geographic got interested
p164
aVbecause National Geographic has the theory that
p165
aVthe last century, discovery was basically finding things,
p166
aVand in this century, discovery is basically making things.
p167
aVDe-extinction falls in that category.
p168
aVSo they hosted and funded this meeting. And 35 scientists,
p169
aVthey were conservation biologists and molecular biologists,
p170
aVbasically meeting to see if they had work to do together.
p171
aVSome of these conservation biologists are pretty radical.
p172
aVThere's three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species,
p173
aVthey're recreating extinct ecosystems
p174
aVin northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii.
p175
aa(lp176
VHenri, from the Netherlands,
p177
aVwith a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce,
p178
aVis working on the aurochs.
p179
aVThe aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle,
p180
aVand so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed.
p181
aVSo what they're doing is working with seven breeds
p182
aVof primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there
p183
aVto rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding,
p184
aVthe aurochs.
p185
aVNow, re-wilding is moving faster in Korea
p186
aVthan it is in America,
p187
aVand so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe,
p188
aVthey will introduce the aurochs to do its old job,
p189
aVits old ecological role,
p190
aVof clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forest
p191
aVso that it has these biodiverse meadows in it.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnother amazing story
p194
aVcame from Alberto Fernández-Arias.
p195
aVAlberto worked with the bucardo in Spain.
p196
aVThe last bucardo was a female named Celia
p197
aVwho was still alive, but then they captured her,
p198
aVthey got a little bit of tissue from her ear,
p199
aVthey cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen,
p200
aVreleased her back into the wild,
p201
aVbut a few months later, she was found dead under a fallen tree.
p202
aVThey took the DNA from that ear,
p203
aVthey planted it as a cloned egg in a goat,
p204
aVthe pregnancy came to term,
p205
aVand a live baby bucardo was born.
p206
aVIt was the first de-extinction in history.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VIt was short-lived.
p211
aVSometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems.
p212
aVThis one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes,
p213
aVbut Alberto was confident that
p214
aVcloning has moved along well since then,
p215
aVand this will move ahead, and eventually
p216
aVthere will be a population of bucardos
p217
aVback in the mountains in northern Spain.
p218
aa(lp219
VCryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder.
p220
aVAt the San Diego zoo, his frozen zoo
p221
aVhas collected the tissues from over 1,000 species
p222
aVover the last 35 years.
p223
aVNow, when it's frozen that deep,
p224
aVminus 196 degrees Celsius,
p225
aVthe cells are intact and the DNA is intact.
p226
aVThey're basically viable cells,
p227
aVso someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology
p228
aVtook some of that tissue from an endangered animal
p229
aVcalled the Javan banteng, put it in a cow,
p230
aVthe cow went to term, and what was born
p231
aVwas a live, healthy baby Javan banteng,
p232
aVwho thrived and is still alive.
p233
aa(lp234
VThe most exciting thing for Bob Lanza
p235
aVis the ability now to take any kind of cell
p236
aVwith induced pluripotent stem cells
p237
aVand turn it into germ cells, like sperm and eggs.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo now we go to Mike McGrew
p240
aVwho is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland,
p241
aVand Mike's doing miracles with birds.
p242
aVSo he'll take, say, falcon skin cells, fibroblast,
p243
aVturn it into induced pluripotent stem cells.
p244
aVSince it's so pluripotent, it can become germ plasm.
p245
aVHe then has a way to put the germ plasm
p246
aVinto the embryo of a chicken egg
p247
aVso that that chicken will have, basically,
p248
aVthe gonads of a falcon.
p249
aVYou get a male and a female each of those,
p250
aVand out of them comes falcons.
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVReal falcons out of slightly doctored chickens.
p253
aa(lp254
VBen Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting.
p255
aVHe showed how all of this can be put together.
p256
aVThe sequence of events: he'll put together the genomes
p257
aVof the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon,
p258
aVhe'll take the techniques of George Church
p259
aVand get passenger pigeon DNA,
p260
aVthe techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew,
p261
aVget that DNA into chicken gonads,
p262
aVand out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs, squabs,
p263
aVand now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons.
p264
aa(lp265
VIt does raise the question of,
p266
aVthey're not going to have passenger pigeon parents
p267
aVto teach them how to be a passenger pigeon.
p268
aVSo what do you do about that?
p269
aVWell birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens,
p270
aVso most of that is already in their DNA,
p271
aVbut to supplement it, part of Ben's idea
p272
aVis to use homing pigeons
p273
aVto help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock
p274
aVand how to find their way to their old nesting grounds
p275
aVand feeding grounds.
p276
aa(lp277
VThere were some conservationists,
p278
aVreally famous conservationists like Stanley Temple,
p279
aVwho is one of the founders of conservation biology,
p280
aVand Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List.
p281
aVThey're excited about all this,
p282
aVbut they're also concerned that it might be competitive
p283
aVwith the extremely important efforts to protect
p284
aVendangered species that are still alive,
p285
aVthat haven't gone extinct yet.
p286
aVYou see, you want to work on protecting the animals out there.
p287
aVYou want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia down
p288
aVso you're not using 25,000 elephants a year.
p289
aa(lp290
VBut at the same time, conservation biologists are realizing
p291
aVthat bad news bums people out.
p292
aVAnd so the Red List is really important, keep track of
p293
aVwhat's endangered and critically endangered, and so on.
p294
aVBut they're about to create what they call a Green List,
p295
aVand the Green List will have species that are doing fine, thank you,
p296
aVspecies that were endangered, like the bald eagle,
p297
aVbut they're much better off now, thanks to everybody's good work,
p298
aVand protected areas around the world
p299
aVthat are very, very well managed.
p300
aVSo basically, they're learning how to build on good news.
p301
aVAnd they see reviving extinct species
p302
aVas the kind of good news you might be able to build on.
p303
aa(lp304
VHere's a couple related examples.
p305
aVCaptive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species.
p306
aVThe California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987.
p307
aVEverybody thought is was finished.
p308
aVThanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo,
p309
aVthere's 405 of them now, 226 are out in the wild.
p310
aVThat technology will be used on de-extincted animals.
p311
aVAnother success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa.
p312
aVIn 1981, Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct.
p313
aVThere were just 254 left.
p314
aVNow there are 880. They're increasing in population
p315
aVby three percent a year.
p316
aVThe secret is, they have an eco-tourism program,
p317
aVwhich is absolutely brilliant.
p318
aVSo this photograph was taken last month by Ryan
p319
aVwith an iPhone.
p320
aVThat's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnother interesting project, though it's going to need some help,
p323
aVis the northern white rhinoceros.
p324
aVThere's no breeding pairs left.
p325
aVBut this is the kind of thing that
p326
aVa wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo.
p327
aVA bit of cloning, you can get them back.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo where do we go from here?
p330
aVThese have been private meetings so far.
p331
aVI think it's time for the subject to go public.
p332
aVWhat do people think about it?
p333
aVYou know, do you want extinct species back?
p334
aVDo you want extinct species back?
p335
aa(lp336
V(Applause)
p337
aa(lp338
VTinker Bell is going to come fluttering down.
p339
aVIt is a Tinker Bell moment,
p340
aVbecause what are people excited about with this?
p341
aVWhat are they concerned about?
p342
aa(lp343
VWe're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon.
p344
aVSo Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group
p345
aVthat Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz.
p346
aVThey're going to work on the genomes
p347
aVof the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon.
p348
aVAs that data matures, they'll send it to George Church,
p349
aVwho will work his magic, get passenger pigeon DNA out of that.
p350
aVWe'll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrew
p351
aVto get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens
p352
aVthat can produce passenger pigeon squabs
p353
aVthat can be raised by band-tailed pigeon parents,
p354
aVand then from then on, it's passenger pigeons all the way,
p355
aVmaybe for the next six million years.
p356
aVYou can do the same thing, as the costs come down,
p357
aVfor the Carolina parakeet, for the great auk,
p358
aVfor the heath hen, for the ivory-billed woodpecker,
p359
aVfor the Eskimo curlew, for the Caribbean monk seal,
p360
aVfor the woolly mammoth.
p361
aa(lp362
VBecause the fact is, humans have made a huge hole
p363
aVin nature in the last 10,000 years.
p364
aVWe have the ability now,
p365
aVand maybe the moral obligation, to repair some of the damage.
p366
aVMost of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands,
p367
aVby expanding and protecting
p368
aVthe populations of endangered species.
p369
aVBut some species
p370
aVthat we killed off totally
p371
aVwe could consider bringing back
p372
aVto a world that misses them.
p373
aa(lp374
VThank you.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Applause)
p377
aa(lp378
VChris Anderson: Thank you.
p379
aVI've got a question.
p380
aVSo, this is an emotional topic. Some people stand.
p381
aVI suspect there are some people out there sitting,
p382
aVkind of asking tormented questions, almost, about,
p383
aVwell, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute,
p384
aVthere's something wrong with mankind
p385
aVinterfering in nature in this way.
p386
aVThere's going to be unintended consequences.
p387
aVYou're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box
p388
aVof who-knows-what. Do they have a point?
p389
aa(lp390
VStewart Brand: Well, the earlier point is
p391
aVwe interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct,
p392
aVand many of them were keystone species,
p393
aVand we changed the whole ecosystem they were in
p394
aVby letting them go.
p395
aVNow, there's the shifting baseline problem, which is,
p396
aVso when these things come back,
p397
aVthey might replace some birds that are there
p398
aVthat people really know and love.
p399
aVI think that's, you know, part of how it'll work.
p400
aVThis is a long, slow process \u2014
p401
aVOne of the things I like about it, it's multi-generation.
p402
aVWe will get woolly mammoths back.
p403
aa(lp404
VCA: Well it feels like both the conversation
p405
aVand the potential here are pretty thrilling.
p406
aVThank you so much for presenting. SB: Thank you.
p407
aa(lp408
VCA: Thank you. (Applause)

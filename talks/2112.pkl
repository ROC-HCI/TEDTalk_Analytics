VTechnology has brought us so much:
p5
aVthe moon landing, the Internet,
p6
aVthe ability to sequence the human genome.
p7
aVBut it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears,
p8
aVand about 30 years ago,
p9
aVthe culture critic Neil Postman wrote a book
p10
aVcalled "Amusing Ourselves to Death,"
p11
aVwhich lays this out really brilliantly.
p12
aVAnd here's what he said,
p13
aVcomparing the dystopian visions
p14
aVof George Orwell and Aldous Huxley.
p15
aVHe said, Orwell feared we would become
p16
aVa captive culture.
p17
aVHuxley feared we would become a trivial culture.
p18
aVOrwell feared the truth would be
p19
aVconcealed from us,
p20
aVand Huxley feared we would be drowned
p21
aVin a sea of irrelevance.
p22
aVIn a nutshell, it's a choice between
p23
aVBig Brother watching you
p24
aVand you watching Big Brother.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VBut it doesn't have to be this way.
p28
aVWe are not passive consumers of data and technology.
p29
aVWe shape the role it plays in our lives
p30
aVand the way we make meaning from it,
p31
aVbut to do that,
p32
aVwe have to pay as much attention to how we think
p33
aVas how we code.
p34
aVWe have to ask questions, and hard questions,
p35
aVto move past counting things
p36
aVto understanding them.
p37
aVWe're constantly bombarded with stories
p38
aVabout how much data there is in the world,
p39
aVbut when it comes to big data
p40
aVand the challenges of interpreting it,
p41
aVsize isn't everything.
p42
aVThere's also the speed at which it moves,
p43
aVand the many varieties of data types,
p44
aVand here are just a few examples:
p45
aVimages,
p46
aVtext,
p47
aVvideo,
p48
aVaudio.
p49
aVAnd what unites this disparate types of data
p50
aVis that they're created by people
p51
aVand they require context.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, there's a group of data scientists
p54
aVout of the University of Illinois-Chicago,
p55
aVand they're called the Health Media Collaboratory,
p56
aVand they've been working with the Centers for Disease Control
p57
aVto better understand
p58
aVhow people talk about quitting smoking,
p59
aVhow they talk about electronic cigarettes,
p60
aVand what they can do collectively
p61
aVto help them quit.
p62
aVThe interesting thing is, if you want to understand
p63
aVhow people talk about smoking,
p64
aVfirst you have to understand
p65
aVwhat they mean when they say "smoking."
p66
aVAnd on Twitter, there are four main categories:
p67
aVnumber one, smoking cigarettes;
p68
aVnumber two, smoking marijuana;
p69
aVnumber three, smoking ribs;
p70
aVand number four, smoking hot women.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VSo then you have to think about, well,
p74
aVhow do people talk about electronic cigarettes?
p75
aVAnd there are so many different ways
p76
aVthat people do this, and you can see from the slide
p77
aVit's a complex kind of a query.
p78
aVAnd what it reminds us is that
p79
aVlanguage is created by people,
p80
aVand people are messy and we're complex
p81
aVand we use metaphors and slang and jargon
p82
aVand we do this 24/7 in many, many languages,
p83
aVand then as soon as we figure it out, we change it up.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo did these ads that the CDC put on,
p86
aVthese television ads that featured a woman
p87
aVwith a hole in her throat and that were very graphic
p88
aVand very disturbing,
p89
aVdid they actually have an impact
p90
aVon whether people quit?
p91
aVAnd the Health Media Collaboratory respected the limits of their data,
p92
aVbut they were able to conclude
p93
aVthat those advertisements \u2014 and you may have seen them \u2014
p94
aVthat they had the effect of jolting people
p95
aVinto a thought process
p96
aVthat may have an impact on future behavior.
p97
aVAnd what I admire and  appreciate about this project,
p98
aVaside from the fact, including the fact
p99
aVthat it's based on real human need,
p100
aVis that it's a fantastic example of courage
p101
aVin the face of a sea of irrelevance.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd so it's not just big data that causes
p104
aVchallenges of interpretation, because let's face it,
p105
aVwe human beings have a very rich history
p106
aVof taking any amount of data, no matter how small,
p107
aVand screwing it up.
p108
aVSo many years ago, you may remember
p109
aVthat former President Ronald Reagan
p110
aVwas very criticized for making a statement
p111
aVthat facts are stupid things.
p112
aVAnd it was a slip of the tongue, let's be fair.
p113
aVHe actually meant to quote John Adams' defense
p114
aVof British soldiers in the Boston Massacre trials
p115
aVthat facts are stubborn things.
p116
aVBut I actually think there's
p117
aVa bit of accidental wisdom in what he said,
p118
aVbecause facts are stubborn things,
p119
aVbut sometimes they're stupid, too.
p120
aa(lp121
VI want to tell you a personal story
p122
aVabout why this matters a lot to me.
p123
aVI need to take a breath.
p124
aVMy son Isaac, when he was two,
p125
aVwas diagnosed with autism,
p126
aVand he was this happy, hilarious,
p127
aVloving, affectionate little guy,
p128
aVbut the metrics on his developmental evaluations,
p129
aVwhich looked at things like  the number of words \u2014
p130
aVat that point, none \u2014
p131
aVcommunicative gestures and minimal eye contact,
p132
aVput his developmental level
p133
aVat that of a nine-month-old baby.
p134
aVAnd the diagnosis was factually correct,
p135
aVbut it didn't tell the whole story.
p136
aVAnd about a year and a half later,
p137
aVwhen he was almost four,
p138
aVI found him in front of the computer one day
p139
aVrunning a Google image search on women,
p140
aVspelled "w-i-m-e-n."
p141
aVAnd I did what any obsessed parent would do,
p142
aVwhich is immediately started  hitting the "back" button
p143
aVto see what else he'd been searching for.
p144
aVAnd they were, in order: men,
p145
aVschool, bus and computer.
p146
aVAnd I was stunned,
p147
aVbecause we didn't know that he could spell,
p148
aVmuch less read, and so I asked him,
p149
aV"Isaac, how did you do this?"
p150
aVAnd he looked at me very seriously and said,
p151
aV"Typed in the box."
p152
aa(lp153
VHe was teaching himself to communicate,
p154
aVbut we were looking in the wrong place,
p155
aVand this is what happens when assessments
p156
aVand analytics overvalue one metric \u2014
p157
aVin this case, verbal communication \u2014
p158
aVand undervalue others, such as creative problem-solving.
p159
aVCommunication was hard for Isaac,
p160
aVand so he found a workaround
p161
aVto find out what he needed to know.
p162
aVAnd when you think about it, it makes a lot of sense,
p163
aVbecause forming a question
p164
aVis a really complex process,
p165
aVbut he could get himself a lot of the way there
p166
aVby putting a word in a search box.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd so this little moment
p169
aVhad a really profound impact on me
p170
aVand our family
p171
aVbecause it helped us change our frame of reference
p172
aVfor what was going on with him,
p173
aVand worry a little bit less and appreciate
p174
aVhis resourcefulness more.
p175
aa(lp176
VFacts are stupid things.
p177
aVAnd they're vulnerable to misuse,
p178
aVwillful or otherwise.
p179
aVI have a friend, Emily Willingham, who's a scientist,
p180
aVand she wrote a piece for Forbes not long ago
p181
aVentitled "The 10 Weirdest Things
p182
aVEver Linked to Autism."
p183
aVIt's quite a list.
p184
aVThe Internet, blamed for everything, right?
p185
aVAnd of course mothers, because.
p186
aVAnd actually, wait, there's more,
p187
aVthere's a whole bunch in  the "mother" category here.
p188
aVAnd you can see it's a pretty  rich and interesting list.
p189
aVI'm a big fan of
p190
aVbeing pregnant near freeways, personally.
p191
aVThe final one is interesting,
p192
aVbecause the term "refrigerator mother"
p193
aVwas actually the original hypothesis
p194
aVfor the cause of autism,
p195
aVand that meant somebody  who was cold and unloving.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd at this point, you might be thinking,
p198
aV"Okay, Susan, we get it,
p199
aVyou can take data, you can  make it mean anything."
p200
aVAnd this is true, it's absolutely true,
p201
aVbut the challenge is that
p202
aVwe have this opportunity
p203
aVto try to make meaning out of it ourselves,
p204
aVbecause frankly, data doesn't  create meaning. We do.
p205
aVSo as businesspeople, as consumers,
p206
aVas patients, as citizens,
p207
aVwe have a responsibility, I think,
p208
aVto spend more time
p209
aVfocusing on our critical thinking skills.
p210
aVWhy?
p211
aVBecause at this point in our history, as we've heard
p212
aVmany times over,
p213
aVwe can process exabytes of data
p214
aVat lightning speed,
p215
aVand we have the potential to make bad decisions
p216
aVfar more quickly, efficiently,
p217
aVand with far greater impact than we did in the past.
p218
aVGreat, right?
p219
aVAnd so what we need to do instead
p220
aVis spend a little bit more time
p221
aVon things like the humanities
p222
aVand sociology, and the social sciences,
p223
aVrhetoric, philosophy, ethics,
p224
aVbecause they give us context that is so important
p225
aVfor big data, and because
p226
aVthey help us become better critical thinkers.
p227
aVBecause after all, if I can spot
p228
aVa problem in an argument, it doesn't much matter
p229
aVwhether it's expressed in words or in numbers.
p230
aVAnd this means
p231
aVteaching ourselves to find  those confirmation biases
p232
aVand false correlations
p233
aVand being able to spot a naked emotional appeal
p234
aVfrom 30 yards,
p235
aVbecause something that happens after something
p236
aVdoesn't mean it happened  because of it, necessarily,
p237
aVand if you'll let me geek out on you for a second,
p238
aVthe Romans called this  "post hoc ergo propter hoc,"
p239
aVafter which therefore because of which.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd it means questioning disciplines like demographics.
p242
aVWhy? Because they're based on assumptions
p243
aVabout who we all are based on our gender
p244
aVand our age and where we live
p245
aVas opposed to data on what  we actually think and do.
p246
aVAnd since we have this data,
p247
aVwe need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls
p248
aVand consumer opt-in,
p249
aVand beyond that, we need to be clear
p250
aVabout our hypotheses,
p251
aVthe methodologies that we use,
p252
aVand our confidence in the result.
p253
aVAs my high school algebra teacher used to say,
p254
aVshow your math,
p255
aVbecause if I don't know what steps you took,
p256
aVI don't know what steps you didn't take,
p257
aVand if I don't know what questions you asked,
p258
aVI don't know what questions you didn't ask.
p259
aVAnd it means asking ourselves, really,
p260
aVthe hardest question of all:
p261
aVDid the data really show us this,
p262
aVor does the result make us feel
p263
aVmore successful and more comfortable?
p264
aa(lp265
VSo the Health Media Collaboratory,
p266
aVat the end of their project, they were able
p267
aVto find that 87 percent of tweets
p268
aVabout those very graphic and disturbing
p269
aVanti-smoking ads expressed fear,
p270
aVbut did they conclude
p271
aVthat they actually made people stop smoking?
p272
aVNo. It's science, not magic.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo if we are to unlock
p275
aVthe power of data,
p276
aVwe don't have to go blindly into
p277
aVOrwell's vision of a totalitarian future,
p278
aVor Huxley's vision of a trivial one,
p279
aVor some horrible cocktail of both.
p280
aVWhat we have to do
p281
aVis treat critical thinking with respect
p282
aVand be inspired by examples
p283
aVlike the Health Media Collaboratory,
p284
aVand as they say in the superhero movies,
p285
aVlet's use our powers for good.
p286
aa(lp287
VThank you.

VThere's a poem written
p5
aVby a very famous English poet
p6
aVat the end of the 19th century.
p7
aVIt was said to echo in Churchill's brain
p8
aVin the 1930s.
p9
aVAnd the poem goes:
p10
aV"On the idle hill of summer,
p11
aVlazy with the flow of streams,
p12
aVhark I hear a distant drummer,
p13
aVdrumming like a sound in dreams,
p14
aVfar and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,
p15
aVdear to friend and food to powder,
p16
aVsoldiers marching,
p17
aVsoon to die."
p18
aVThose who are interested in poetry,
p19
aVthe poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut what Housman understood,
p22
aVand you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too,
p23
aVwas that the long, hot, silvan summers
p24
aVof stability of the 19th century
p25
aVwere coming to a close,
p26
aVand that we were about to move
p27
aVinto one of those terrifying periods of history
p28
aVwhen power changes.
p29
aVAnd these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen,
p30
aVaccompanied by turbulence,
p31
aVand all too often by blood.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd my message for you
p34
aVis that I believe we are condemned, if you like,
p35
aVto live at just one of those moments in history
p36
aVwhen the gimbals upon which
p37
aVthe established order of power is beginning to change
p38
aVand the new look of the world,
p39
aVthe new powers that exist in the world,
p40
aVare beginning to take form.
p41
aVAnd these are \u2014 and we see it very clearly today \u2014
p42
aVnearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times,
p43
aVand all too often very bloody times.
p44
aVBy the way, it happens about once every century.
p45
aa(lp46
VYou might argue that the last time it happened \u2014
p47
aVand that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too \u2014
p48
aVwas that when power passed from the old nations,
p49
aVthe old powers of Europe,
p50
aVacross the Atlantic to the new emerging power
p51
aVof the United States of America \u2014
p52
aVthe beginning of the American century.
p53
aVAnd of course, into the vacuum
p54
aVwhere the too-old European powers used to be
p55
aVwere played the two bloody catastrophes
p56
aVof the last century \u2014
p57
aVthe one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.
p58
aVMao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars,
p59
aVand it's probably a more accurate way of describing them.
p60
aa(lp61
VWell, ladies and gentlemen,
p62
aVwe live at one of those times.
p63
aVBut for us, I want to talk about three factors today.
p64
aVAnd the first of these, the first two of these,
p65
aVis about a shift in power.
p66
aVAnd the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to,
p67
aVwhich has never quite happened in the way it's happening now.
p68
aVBut let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.
p69
aVAnd what is happening today
p70
aVis, in one sense, frightening
p71
aVbecause it's never happened before.
p72
aVWe have seen lateral shifts of power \u2014
p73
aVthe power of Greece passed to Rome
p74
aVand the power shifts that occurred
p75
aVduring the European civilizations \u2014
p76
aVbut we are seeing something slightly different.
p77
aVFor power is not just moving laterally
p78
aVfrom nation to nation.
p79
aVIt's also moving vertically.
p80
aa(lp81
VWhat's happening today is that the power that was encased,
p82
aVheld to accountability, held to the rule of law,
p83
aVwithin the institution of the nation state
p84
aVhas now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.
p85
aVThe globalization of power \u2014
p86
aVwe talk about the globalization of markets,
p87
aVbut actually it's the globalization of real power.
p88
aVAnd where, at the nation state level
p89
aVthat power is held to accountability
p90
aVsubject to the rule of law,
p91
aVon the international stage it is not.
p92
aVThe international stage and the global stage where power now resides:
p93
aVthe power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters,
p94
aVthe power of the money changers \u2014
p95
aVthis vast money-go-round
p96
aVthat circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary
p97
aVfor the trade it's supposed to be there to finance \u2014
p98
aVthe money changers, if you like,
p99
aVthe financial speculators
p100
aVthat have brought us all to our knees quite recently,
p101
aVthe power of the multinational corporations
p102
aVnow developing budgets
p103
aVoften bigger than medium-sized countries.
p104
aVThese live in a global space
p105
aVwhich is largely unregulated,
p106
aVnot subject to the rule of law,
p107
aVand in which people may act free of constraint.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow that suits the powerful
p110
aVup to a moment.
p111
aVIt's always suitable for those who have the most power
p112
aVto operate in spaces without constraint,
p113
aVbut the lesson of history is that, sooner or later,
p114
aVunregulated space \u2014
p115
aVspace not subject to the rule of law \u2014
p116
aVbecomes populated, not just by the things you wanted \u2014
p117
aVinternational trade, the Internet, etc. \u2014
p118
aVbut also by the things you don't want \u2014
p119
aVinternational criminality, international terrorism.
p120
aVThe revelation of 9/11
p121
aVis that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth,
p122
aVnevertheless,
p123
aVthose who inhabit that space can attack you
p124
aVeven in your most iconic of cities
p125
aVone bright September morning.
p126
aVIt's said that something like 60 percent
p127
aVof the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11
p128
aVactually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers
p129
aVwhich 9/11 destroyed.
p130
aVYou see, our enemies also use this space \u2014
p131
aVthe space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters \u2014
p132
aVto be able to get around their poison,
p133
aVwhich is about destroying our systems and our ways.
p134
aa(lp135
VSooner or later,
p136
aVsooner or later,
p137
aVthe rule of history
p138
aVis that where power goes
p139
aVgovernance must follow.
p140
aVAnd if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is,
p141
aVthat one of the phenomenon of our time
p142
aVis the globalization of power,
p143
aVthen it follows that one of the challenges of our time
p144
aVis to bring governance to the global space.
p145
aVAnd I believe that the decades ahead of us now
p146
aVwill be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent
p147
aVthe more or less we are able to achieve that aim:
p148
aVto bring governance to the global space.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow notice, I'm not talking about government.
p151
aVI'm not talking about setting up
p152
aVsome global democratic institution.
p153
aVMy own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,
p154
aVis that this is unlikely to be done
p155
aVby spawning more U.N. institutions.
p156
aVIf we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.
p157
aVThe world needs an international forum.
p158
aVIt needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.
p159
aVBut when it comes to governance of the global space,
p160
aVmy guess is this won't happen
p161
aVthrough the creation of more U.N. institutions.
p162
aVIt will actually happen by the powerful coming together
p163
aVand making treaty-based systems,
p164
aVtreaty-based agreements,
p165
aVto govern that global space.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.
p168
aVThe World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization,
p169
aVentirely treaty-based,
p170
aVand yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States,
p171
aVto account if necessary.
p172
aVKyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create
p173
aVa treaty-based organization.
p174
aVThe G20:
p175
aVwe know now that we have to put together an institution
p176
aVwhich is capable of bringing governance
p177
aVto that financial space for financial speculation.
p178
aVAnd that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow there's a problem there,
p181
aVand we'll come back to it in a minute,
p182
aVwhich is that if you bring the most powerful together
p183
aVto make the rules in treaty-based institutions,
p184
aVto fill that governance space,
p185
aVthen what happens to the weak who are left out?
p186
aVAnd that's a big problem,
p187
aVand we'll return to it in just a second.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo there's my first message,
p190
aVthat if you are to pass through these turbulent times
p191
aVmore or less turbulently,
p192
aVthen our success in doing that
p193
aVwill in large measure depend on our capacity
p194
aVto bring sensible governance
p195
aVto the global space.
p196
aVAnd watch that beginning to happen.
p197
aVMy second point is,
p198
aVand I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this
p199
aVabout such a thing,
p200
aVbut power is not just shifting vertically,
p201
aVit's also shifting horizontally.
p202
aa(lp203
VYou might argue that the story, the history of civilizations,
p204
aVhas been civilizations gathered around seas \u2014
p205
aVwith the first ones around the Mediterranean,
p206
aVthe more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.
p207
aVWell it seems to me
p208
aVthat we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking,
p209
aVaway from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard]
p210
aVto the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.
p211
aVNow that begins with economic power,
p212
aVbut that's the way it always begins.
p213
aVYou already begin to see the development of foreign policies,
p214
aVthe augmentation of military budgets
p215
aVoccurring in the other growing powers in the world.
p216
aVI think actually
p217
aVthis is not so much a shift from the West to the East;
p218
aVsomething different is happening.
p219
aa(lp220
VMy guess is, for what it's worth,
p221
aVis that the United States will remain
p222
aVthe most powerful nation on earth
p223
aVfor the next 10 years, 15,
p224
aVbut the context in which she holds her power
p225
aVhas now radically altered; it has radically changed.
p226
aVWe are coming out of 50 years,
p227
aVmost unusual years, of history
p228
aVin which we have had a totally mono-polar world,
p229
aVin which every compass needle
p230
aVfor or against
p231
aVhas to be referenced by its position to Washington \u2014
p232
aVa world bestrode by a single colossus.
p233
aVBut that's not a usual case in history.
p234
aVIn fact, what's now emerging
p235
aVis the much more normal case of history.
p236
aVYou're beginning to see the emergence
p237
aVof a multi-polar world.
p238
aa(lp239
VUp until now,
p240
aVthe United States has been the dominant feature of our world.
p241
aVThey will remain the most powerful nation,
p242
aVbut they will be the most powerful nation
p243
aVin an increasingly multi-polar world.
p244
aVAnd you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up \u2014
p245
aVin China, of course,
p246
aVthough my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.
p247
aVIt's going to be quite grumpy
p248
aVas China begins to democratize her society
p249
aVafter liberalizing her economy.
p250
aVBut that's a subject of a different discussion.
p251
aVYou see India, you see Brazil.
p252
aVYou see increasingly
p253
aVthat the world now looks actually, for us Europeans,
p254
aVmuch more like Europe in the 19th century.
p255
aa(lp256
VEurope in the 19th century:
p257
aVa great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning,
p258
aVused to describe it as the "European concert of powers."
p259
aVThere was a balance, a five-sided balance.
p260
aVBritain always played to the balance.
p261
aVIf Paris got together with Berlin,
p262
aVBritain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.
p263
aVNow notice,
p264
aVin a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world,
p265
aVyou have fixed alliances \u2014
p266
aVNATO, the Warsaw Pact.
p267
aVA fixed polarity of power
p268
aVmeans fixed alliances.
p269
aVBut a multiple polarity of power
p270
aVmeans shifting and changing alliances.
p271
aVAnd that's the world we're coming into,
p272
aVin which we will increasingly see
p273
aVthat our alliances are not fixed.
p274
aVCanning, the great British foreign secretary once said,
p275
aV"Britain has a common interest,
p276
aVbut no common allies."
p277
aVAnd we will see increasingly
p278
aVthat even we in the West
p279
aVwill reach out, have to reach out,
p280
aVbeyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers
p281
aVto make alliances with others
p282
aVif we want to get things done in the world.
p283
aa(lp284
VNote, that when we went into Libya,
p285
aVit was not good enough for the West to do it alone;
p286
aVwe had to bring others in.
p287
aVWe had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.
p288
aVMy guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times
p289
aVwhen the West has tried to do it themselves,
p290
aVand we haven't succeeded.
p291
aVMy guess
p292
aVis that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years \u2014
p293
aVI say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire \u2014
p294
aVof the hegemony of Western power,
p295
aVWestern institutions and Western values.
p296
aVYou know, up until now, if the West got its act together,
p297
aVit could propose and dispose
p298
aVin every corner of the world.
p299
aVBut that's no longer true.
p300
aVTake the last financial crisis
p301
aVafter the Second World War.
p302
aVThe West got together \u2014
p303
aVthe Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund \u2014
p304
aVthe problem solved.
p305
aVNow we have to call in others.
p306
aVNow we have to create the G20.
p307
aVNow we have to reach beyond the cozy circle
p308
aVof our Western friends.
p309
aa(lp310
VLet me make a prediction for you,
p311
aVwhich is probably even more startling.
p312
aVI suspect we are now reaching the end
p313
aVof 400 years
p314
aVwhen Western power was enough.
p315
aVPeople say to me, "The Chinese, of course,
p316
aVthey'll never get themselves involved
p317
aVin peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world."
p318
aVOh yes? Why not?
p319
aVHow many Chinese troops
p320
aVare serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag,
p321
aVserving under the U.N. command in the world today?
p322
aV3,700.
p323
aVHow many Americans? 11.
p324
aVWhat is the largest naval contingent
p325
aVtackling the issue of Somali pirates?
p326
aVThe Chinese naval contingent.
p327
aVOf course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.
p328
aVThey want to keep the sea lanes open.
p329
aVIncreasingly, we are going to have to do business
p330
aVwith people with whom we do not share values,
p331
aVbut with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.
p332
aVIt's a whole new different way
p333
aVof looking at the world that is now emerging.
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd here's the third factor,
p336
aVwhich is totally different.
p337
aVToday in our modern world,
p338
aVbecause of the Internet,
p339
aVbecause of the kinds of things people have been talking about here,
p340
aVeverything is connected to everything.
p341
aVWe are now interdependent.
p342
aVWe are now interlocked,
p343
aVas nations, as individuals,
p344
aVin a way which has never been the case before,
p345
aVnever been the case before.
p346
aVThe interrelationship of nations,
p347
aVwell it's always existed.
p348
aVDiplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations.
p349
aVBut now we are intimately locked together.
p350
aVYou get swine flu in Mexico,
p351
aVit's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport
p352
aV24 hours later.
p353
aVLehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.
p354
aVThere are fires in the steppes of Russia,
p355
aVfood riots in Africa.
p356
aa(lp357
VWe are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.
p358
aVAnd what that means
p359
aVis the idea of a nation state acting alone,
p360
aVnot connected with others,
p361
aVnot working with others,
p362
aVis no longer a viable proposition.
p363
aVBecause the actions of a nation state
p364
aVare neither confined to itself,
p365
aVnor is it sufficient for the nation state itself
p366
aVto control its own territory,
p367
aVbecause the effects outside the nation state
p368
aVare now beginning to affect what happens inside them.
p369
aa(lp370
VI was a young soldier
p371
aVin the last of the small empire wars of Britain.
p372
aVAt that time, the defense of my country
p373
aVwas about one thing and one thing only:
p374
aVhow strong was our army, how strong was our air force,
p375
aVhow strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.
p376
aVThat was when the enemy was outside the walls.
p377
aVNow the enemy is inside the walls.
p378
aVNow if I want to talk about the defense of my country,
p379
aVI have to speak to the Minister of Health
p380
aVbecause pandemic disease is a threat to my security,
p381
aVI have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture
p382
aVbecause food security is a threat to my security,
p383
aVI have to speak to the Minister of Industry
p384
aVbecause the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure
p385
aVis now a point of attack for our enemies \u2014
p386
aVas we see from cyber warfare \u2014
p387
aVI have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs
p388
aVbecause who has entered my country,
p389
aVwho lives in that terraced house in that inner city
p390
aVhas a direct effect on what happens in my country \u2014
p391
aVas we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.
p392
aVIt's no longer the case that the security of a country
p393
aVis simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.
p394
aVIt's its capacity to lock together its institutions.
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd this tells you something very important.
p397
aVIt tells you that, in fact,
p398
aVour governments, vertically constructed,
p399
aVconstructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution \u2014
p400
aVvertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks,
p401
aVcommand structures \u2014
p402
aVhave got the wrong structures completely.
p403
aVYou in business know
p404
aVthat the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen,
p405
aVis the network.
p406
aVIt's your capacity to network that matters,
p407
aVboth within your governments and externally.
p408
aa(lp409
VSo here is Ashdown's third law.
p410
aVBy the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law
p411
aVbecause I haven't invented those yet;
p412
aVit always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it?
p413
aVAshdown's third law is that in the modern age,
p414
aVwhere everything is connected to everything,
p415
aVthe most important thing about what you can do
p416
aVis what you can do with others.
p417
aVThe most important bit about your structure \u2014
p418
aVwhether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment,
p419
aVwhether you're a business \u2014
p420
aVis your docking points, your interconnectors,
p421
aVyour capacity to network with others.
p422
aVYou understand that in industry;
p423
aVgovernments don't.
p424
aa(lp425
VBut now one final thing.
p426
aVIf it is the case, ladies and gentlemen \u2014 and it is \u2014
p427
aVthat we are now locked together
p428
aVin a way that has never been quite the same before,
p429
aVthen it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other.
p430
aVSuddenly and for the very first time,
p431
aVcollective defense, the thing that has dominated us
p432
aVas the concept of securing our nations,
p433
aVis no longer enough.
p434
aVIt used to be the case
p435
aVthat if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe;
p436
aVif my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe;
p437
aVmy alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.
p438
aVIt is no longer the case.
p439
aVThe advent of the interconnectedness
p440
aVand of the weapons of mass destruction
p441
aVmeans that, increasingly,
p442
aVI share a destiny with my enemy.
p443
aa(lp444
VWhen I was a diplomat
p445
aVnegotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union
p446
aVin Geneva in the 1970s,
p447
aVwe succeeded because we understood
p448
aVwe shared a destiny with them.
p449
aVCollective security is not enough.
p450
aVPeace has come to Northern Ireland
p451
aVbecause both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work.
p452
aVThey shared a destiny with their enemies.
p453
aVOne of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East
p454
aVis that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians,
p455

VI started with a poem, I'll end with one.
p464
aVThe great poem of John Donne's.
p465
aV"Send not for whom the bell tolls."
p466
aVThe poem is called "No Man is an Island."
p467
aVAnd it goes:
p468
aV"Every man's death affected me,
p469
aVfor I am involved in mankind,
p470
aVsend not to ask
p471
aVfor whom the bell tolls,
p472
aVit tolls for thee."
p473
aVFor John Donne, a recommendation of morality.

aVFor us, I think,

aVpart of the equation for our survival.

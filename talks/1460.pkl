VWhen the Industrial Revolution started,
p5
aVthe amount of carbon sitting underneath Britain in the form of coal
p6
aVwas as big as the amount of carbon sitting under Saudi Arabia
p7
aVin the form of oil.
p8
aVThis carbon powered the Industrial Revolution,
p9
aVit put the "Great" in Great Britain,
p10
aVand led to Britain's temporary world domination.
p11
aVAnd then, in 1918, coal production in Britain peaked,
p12
aVand has declined ever since.
p13
aVIn due course, Britain started using oil and gas from the North Sea,
p14
aVand in the year 2000,
p15
aVoil and gas production from the North Sea also peaked,
p16
aVand they're now on the decline.
p17
aa(lp18
VThese observations about the finiteness
p19
aVof easily accessible, local, secure fossil fuels,
p20
aVis a motivation for saying, "Well, what's next?
p21
aVWhat is life after fossil fuels going to be like?
p22
aVShouldn't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels?"
p23
aVAnother motivation, of course, is climate change.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd when people talk about life after fossil fuels
p26
aVand climate change action,
p27
aVI think there's a lot of fluff,
p28
aVa lot of greenwash, a lot of misleading advertising,
p29
aVand I feel a duty as a physicist to try to guide people around the claptrap
p30
aVand help people understand the actions that really make a difference,
p31
aVand to focus on ideas that do add up.
p32
aa(lp33
VLet me illustrate this
p34
aVwith what physicists call a back-of-envelope calculation.
p35
aVWe love back-of-envelope calculations.
p36
aVYou ask a question, write down some numbers,
p37
aVand get an answer.
p38
aVIt may not be very accurate, but it may make you say, "Hmm."
p39
aVSo here's a question:
p40
aVImagine if we said, "Oh yes, we can get off fossil fuels.
p41
aVWe'll use biofuels. Problem solved.
p42
aVTransport ... We don't need oil anymore."
p43
aVWell, what if we grew the biofuels for a road
p44
aVon the grass verge at the edge of the road?
p45
aVHow wide would the verge have to be for that to work out?
p46
aa(lp47
VOK, so let's put in some numbers.
p48
aVLet's have our cars go at 60 miles per hour.
p49
aVLet's say they do 30 miles per gallon.
p50
aVThat's the European average for new cars.
p51
aVLet's say the productivity of biofuel plantations
p52
aVis 1,200 liters of biofuel per hectare per year.
p53
aVThat's true of European biofuels.
p54
aVAnd let's imagine the cars are spaced 80 meters apart from each other,
p55
aVand they're perpetually going along this road.
p56
aVThe length of the road doesn't matter,
p57
aVbecause the longer the road, the more biofuel plantation.
p58
aVWhat do we do with these numbers?
p59
aVTake the first number, divide by the other three, and get eight kilometers.
p60
aVAnd that's the answer.
p61
aVThat's how wide the plantation would have to be,
p62
aVgiven these assumptions.
p63
aVAnd maybe that makes you say, "Hmm.
p64
aVMaybe this isn't going to be quite so easy."
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd it might make you think,
p67
aVperhaps there's an issue to do with areas.
p68
aVAnd in this talk, I'd like to talk about land areas, and ask:
p69
aVIs there an issue about areas?
p70
aVThe answer is going to be yes, but it depends which country you are in.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo let's start in the United Kingdom,
p73
aVsince that's where we are today.
p74
aVThe energy consumption of the United Kingdom,
p75
aVthe total energy consumption \u2014 not just transport, but everything \u2014
p76
aVI like to quantify it in lightbulbs.
p77
aVIt's as if we've all got 125 lightbulbs on all the time,
p78
aV125 kilowatt-hours per day per person
p79
aVis the energy consumption of the UK.
p80
aVSo there's 40 lightbulbs' worth for transport,
p81
aV40 lightbulbs' worth for heating,
p82
aVand 40 lightbulbs' worth for making electricity,
p83
aVand other things are relatively small,
p84
aVcompared to those three big fish.
p85
aVIt's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account
p86
aVthe embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well.
p87
aVAnd 90 percent of this energy, today, still comes from fossil fuels,
p88
aVand 10 percent, only, from other, greener \u2014 possibly greener \u2014 sources,
p89
aVlike nuclear power and renewables.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo.
p92
aVThat's the UK.
p93
aVThe population density of the UK is 250 people per square kilometer.
p94
aVI'm now going to show you other countries by these same two measures.
p95
aVOn the vertical axis, I'm going to show you how many lightbulbs \u2014
p96
aVwhat our energy consumption per person is.
p97
aVWe're at 125 lightbulbs per person,
p98
aVand that little blue dot there is showing you the land area
p99
aVof the United Kingdom.
p100
aVThe population density is on the horizontal axis,
p101
aVand we're 250 people per square kilometer.
p102
aVLet's add European countries in blue,
p103
aVand you can see there's quite a variety.
p104
aVI should emphasize, both of these axes are logarithmic;
p105
aVas you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar,
p106
aVyou're going up a factor of 10.
p107
aVNext, let's add Asia in red,
p108
aVthe Middle East and North Africa in green,
p109
aVsub-Saharan Africa in blue,
p110
aVblack is South America,
p111
aVpurple is Central America,
p112
aVand then in pukey-yellow, we have North America,
p113
aVAustralia and New Zealand.
p114
aVYou can see the great diversity of population densities
p115
aVand of per capita consumptions.
p116
aVCountries are different from each other.
p117
aa(lp118
VTop left, we have Canada and Australia, with enormous land areas,
p119
aVvery high per capita consumption \u2014 200 or 300 lightbulbs per person \u2014
p120
aVand very low population densities.
p121
aVTop right: Bahrain has the same energy consumption
p122
aVper person, roughly, as Canada \u2014
p123
aVover 300 lightbulbs per person,
p124
aVbut their population density is a factor of 300 times greater,
p125
aV1,000 people per square kilometer.
p126
aVBottom right: Bangladesh has the same population density as Bahrain,
p127
aVbut consumes 100 times less per person.
p128
aa(lp129
VBottom left: well, there's no one.
p130
aVBut there used to be a whole load of people.
p131
aVHere's another message from this diagram.
p132
aVI've added on little blue tails behind Sudan, Libya,
p133
aVChina, India, Bangladesh.
p134
aVThat's 15 years of progress.
p135
aVWhere were they 15 years ago, and where are they now?
p136
aVAnd the message is,
p137
aVmost countries are going to the right, and they're going up.
p138
aVUp and to the right: bigger population density
p139
aVand higher per capita consumption.
p140
aVSo, we may be off in the top right-hand corner, slightly unusual,
p141
aVthe United Kingdom accompanied by Germany,
p142
aVJapan, South Korea, the Netherlands,
p143
aVand a bunch of other slightly odd countries,
p144
aVbut many other countries are coming up and to the right to join us.
p145
aVSo we're a picture, if you like,
p146
aVof what the future energy consumption
p147
aVmight be looking like in other countries, too.
p148
aa(lp149
VI've also added in this diagram now some pink lines
p150
aVthat go down and to the right.
p151
aVThose are lines of equal power consumption per unit area,
p152
aVwhich I measure in watts per square meter.
p153
aVSo, for example, the middle line there, 0.1 watts per square meter,
p154
aVis the energy consumption per unit area of Saudi Arabia,
p155
aVNorway, Mexico in purple, and Bangladesh 15 years ago.
p156
aVHalf of the world's population lives in countries
p157
aVthat are already above that line.
p158
aVThe United Kingdom is consuming 1.25 watts per square meter.
p159
aVSo is Germany, and Japan is consuming a bit more.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo, let's now say why this is relevant.
p162
aVWhy is it relevant?
p163
aVWell, we can measure renewables in the same units
p164
aVand other forms of power production in the same units.
p165
aVRenewables is one of the leading ideas
p166
aVfor how we could get off our 90 percent fossil-fuel habit.
p167
aVSo here come some renewables.
p168
aVEnergy crops deliver half a watt per square meter
p169
aVin European climates.
p170
aVWhat does that mean?
p171
aVYou might have anticipated that result,
p172
aVgiven what I told you about the biofuel plantation a moment ago.
p173
aVWell, we consume 1.25 watts per square meter.
p174
aVWhat this means is,
p175
aVeven if you covered the whole of the United Kingdom with energy crops,
p176
aVyou couldn't match today's energy consumption.
p177
aVWind power produces a bit more \u2014 2.5 watts per square meter.
p178
aVBut that's only twice as big as 1.25 watts per square meter.
p179
aVSo that means if you wanted, literally, to produce total energy consumption
p180
aVin all forms, on average, from wind farms,
p181
aVyou need wind farms half the area of the UK.
p182
aVI've got data to back up all these assertions, by the way.
p183
aa(lp184
VNext, let's look at solar power.
p185
aVSolar panels, when you put them on a roof,
p186
aVdeliver about 20 watts per square meter in England.
p187
aVIf you really want to get a lot from solar panels,
p188
aVyou need to adopt the traditional Bavarian farming method,
p189
aVwhere you leap off the roof,
p190
aVand coat the countryside with solar panels, too.
p191
aVSolar parks, because of the gaps between the panels, deliver less.
p192
aVThey deliver about 5 watts per square meter of land area.
p193
aVAnd here's a solar park in Vermont, with real data,
p194
aVdelivering 4.2 watts per square meter.
p195
aVRemember where we are, 1.25 watts per square meter,
p196
aVwind farms 2.5, solar parks about five.
p197
aVSo whichever of those renewables you pick,
p198
aVthe message is, whatever mix of those renewables you're using,
p199
aVif you want to power the UK on them,
p200
aVyou're going to need to cover something like
p201
aV20 percent or 25 percent of the country
p202
aVwith those renewables.
p203
aVI'm not saying that's a bad idea; we just need to understand the numbers.
p204
aVI'm absolutely not anti-renewables. I love renewables.
p205
aVBut I'm also pro-arithmetic.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VConcentrating solar power in deserts delivers larger powers per unit area,
p210
aVbecause you don't have the problem of clouds.
p211
aVSo, this facility delivers 14 watts per square meter;
p212
aVthis one 10 watts per square meter;
p213
aVand this one in Spain, 5 watts per square meter.
p214
aVBeing generous to concentrating solar power,
p215
aVI think it's perfectly credible it could deliver 20 watts per square meter.
p216
aVSo that's nice.
p217
aVOf course, Britain doesn't have any deserts.
p218
aVYet.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VSo here's a summary so far:
p223
aVAll renewables, much as I love them, are diffuse.
p224
aVThey all have a small power per unit area,
p225
aVand we have to live with that fact.
p226
aVAnd that means, if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference
p227
aVfor a country like the United Kingdom
p228
aVon the scale of today's consumption,
p229
aVyou need to be imagining renewable facilities that are country-sized.
p230
aVNot the entire country,
p231
aVbut a fraction of the country, a substantial fraction.
p232
aa(lp233
VThere are other options for generating power as well,
p234
aVwhich don't involve fossil fuels.
p235
aVSo there's nuclear power, and on this ordinance survey map,
p236
aVyou can see there's a Sizewell B inside a blue square kilometer.
p237
aVThat's one gigawatt in a square kilometer,
p238
aVwhich works out to 1,000 watts per square meter.
p239
aVSo by this particular metric,
p240
aVnuclear power isn't as intrusive as renewables.
p241
aa(lp242
VOf course, other metrics matter, too,
p243
aVand nuclear power has all sorts of popularity problems.
p244
aVBut the same goes for renewables as well.
p245
aVHere's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing
p246
aVin the little town of Penicuik just outside Edinburgh,
p247
aVand you can see the children of Penicuik celebrating
p248
aVthe burning of the effigy of the windmill.
p249
aVSo \u2014
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VPeople are anti-everything,
p254
aVand we've got to keep all the options on the table.
p255
aa(lp256
VWhat can a country like the UK do on the supply side?
p257
aVWell, the options are, I'd say, these three:
p258
aVpower renewables,
p259
aVand recognizing that they need to be close to country-sized;
p260
aVother people's renewables,
p261
aVso we could go back and talk very politely
p262
aVto the people in the top left-hand side of the diagram and say,
p263
aV"Uh, we don't want renewables in our backyard,
p264
aVbut, um, please could we put them in yours instead?"
p265
aVAnd that's a serious option.
p266
aVIt's a way for the world to handle this issue.
p267
aVSo countries like Australia, Russia, Libya, Kazakhstan,
p268
aVcould be our best friends for renewable production.
p269
aVAnd a third option is nuclear power.
p270
aVSo that's some supply-side options.
p271
aa(lp272
VIn addition to the supply levers that we can push \u2014
p273
aVand remember, we need large amounts,
p274
aVbecause at the moment, we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels \u2014
p275
aVin addition to those levers,
p276
aVwe could talk about other ways of solving this issue.
p277
aVNamely, we could reduce demand, and that means reducing population \u2014
p278
aVI'm not sure how to do that \u2014
p279
aVor reducing per capita consumption.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo let's talk about three more big levers
p282
aVthat could really help on the consumption side.
p283
aVFirst, transport.
p284
aVHere are the physics principles
p285
aVthat tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport.
p286
aVPeople often say, "Technology can answer everything.
p287
aVWe can make vehicles that are 100 times more efficient."
p288
aVAnd that's almost true. Let me show you.
p289
aa(lp290
VThe energy consumption of this typical tank here
p291
aVis 80 kilowatt hours per hundred person kilometers.
p292
aVThat's the average European car.
p293
aVEighty kilowatt hours.
p294
aVCan we make something 100 times better
p295
aVby applying the physics principles I just listed?
p296
aVYes. Here it is. It's the bicycle.
p297
aVIt's 80 times better in energy consumption,
p298
aVand it's powered by biofuel, by Weetabix.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd there are other options in between,
p303
aVbecause maybe the lady in the tank would say,
p304
aV"No, that's a lifestyle change. Don't change my lifestyle, please."
p305
aVWe could persuade her to take a train, still a lot more efficient than a car,
p306
aVbut that might be a lifestyle change.
p307
aVOr there's the EcoCAR, top-left.
p308
aVIt comfortably accommodates one teenager and it's shorter than a traffic cone,
p309
aVand it's almost as efficient as a bicycle,
p310
aVas long as you drive it at 15 miles per hour.
p311
aVIn between, perhaps some more realistic options
p312
aVon the transport lever are electric vehicles,
p313
aVso electric bikes and electric cars in the middle,
p314
aVperhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol-powered tank.
p315
aa(lp316
VNext, there's the heating lever.
p317
aVHeating is a third of our energy consumption in Britain,
p318
aVand quite a lot of that is going into homes
p319
aVand other buildings,
p320
aVdoing space heating and water heating.
p321
aVSo here's a typical crappy British house.
p322
aVIt's my house, with a Ferrari out front.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VWhat can we do to it?
p327
aVWell, the laws of physics are written up there,
p328
aVwhich describe how the power consumption for heating
p329
aVis driven by the things you can control.
p330
aVThe things you can control are the temperature difference
p331
aVbetween the inside and the outside.
p332
aVThere's this remarkable technology called a thermostat:
p333
aVyou grasp it, rotate it to the left,
p334
aVand your energy consumption in the home will decrease.
p335
aVI've tried it. It works. Some people call it a lifestyle change.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VYou can also get the fluff men in to reduce the leakiness
p340
aVof your building \u2014 put fluff in the walls, fluff in the roof,
p341
aVa new front door, and so forth.
p342
aVThe sad truth is, this will save you money.
p343
aVThat's not sad, that's good.
p344
aVBut the sad truth is,
p345
aVit'll only get about 25 percent of the leakiness of your building
p346
aVif you do these things, which are good ideas.
p347
aVIf you really want to get a bit closer to Swedish building standards
p348
aVwith a crappy house like this,
p349
aVyou need to be putting external insulation on the building,
p350
aVas shown by this block of flats in London.
p351
aVYou can also deliver heat more efficiently using heat pumps,
p352
aVwhich use a smaller bit of high-grade energy like electricity
p353
aVto move heat from your garden into your house.
p354
aa(lp355
VThe third demand-side option I want to talk about,
p356
aVthe third way to reduce energy consumption is: read your meters.
p357
aVPeople talk a lot about smart meters,
p358
aVbut you can do it yourself.
p359
aVUse your own eyes and be smart.
p360
aVRead your meter, and if you're anything like me, it'll change your life.
p361
aVHere's a graph I made.
p362
aVI was writing a book about sustainable energy,
p363
aVand a friend asked me,
p364
aV"How much energy do you use at home?"
p365
aVI was embarrassed; I didn't actually know.
p366
aVAnd so I started reading the meter every week.
p367
aVThe old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph,
p368
aVand then 2007 is shown in green at the bottom.
p369
aVThat was when I was reading the meter every week.
p370
aVAnd my life changed,
p371
aVbecause I started doing experiments and seeing what made a difference.
p372
aVMy gas consumption plummeted,
p373
aVbecause I started tinkering with the thermostat
p374
aVand the timing on the heating system,
p375
aVand I knocked more than half off my gas bills.
p376
aa(lp377
VThere's a similar story for my electricity consumption,
p378
aVwhere switching off the DVD players, the stereos,
p379
aVthe computer peripherals that were on all the time,
p380
aVand just switching them on when I needed them,
p381
aVknocked another third off my electricity bills, too.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo we need a plan that adds up.
p384
aVI've described for you six big levers.
p385
aVWe need big action,
p386
aVbecause we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels,
p387
aVand so you need to push hard on most, if not all, of these levers.
p388
aVMost of these levers have popularity problems,
p389
aVand if there is a lever you don't like the use of,
p390
aVwell, please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort
p391
aVon the other levers.
p392
aa(lp393
VSo I'm a strong advocate of having grown-up conversations
p394
aVthat are based on numbers and facts.
p395
aVAnd I want to close with this map that just visualizes for you
p396
aVthe requirement of land and so forth
p397
aVin order to get just 16 lightbulbs per person
p398
aVfrom four of the big possible sources.
p399
aVSo, if you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs \u2014
p400
aVremember, today our total energy consumption is 125 lightbulbs' worth \u2014
p401
aVif you wanted 16 from wind,
p402
aVthis map visualizes a solution for the UK.
p403
aVIt's got 160 wind farms, each 100 square kilometers in size,
p404
aVand that would be a twentyfold increase over today's amount of wind.
p405
aa(lp406
VNuclear power: to get 16 lightbulbs per person,
p407
aVyou'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map.
p408
aVThat's a fourfold increase over today's levels of nuclear power.
p409
aa(lp410
VBiomass: to get 16 lightbulbs per person,
p411
aVyou'd need a land area something like three and a half Wales' worth,
p412
aVeither in our country, or in someone else's country,
p413
aVpossibly Ireland, possibly somewhere else.
p414
aa(lp415
V(Laughter)
p416
aa(lp417
VAnd a fourth supply-side option:
p418
aVconcentrating solar power in other people's deserts.
p419
aVIf you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs' worth,
p420
aVthen we're talking about these eight hexagons
p421
aVdown at the bottom right.
p422
aVThe total area of those hexagons is two Greater London's worth
p423
aVof someone else's Sahara,
p424
aVand you'll need power lines all the way across Spain and France
p425
aVto bring the power from the Sahara to Surrey.
p426
aa(lp427
V(Laughter)
p428
aa(lp429
VWe need a plan that adds up.
p430
aVWe need to stop shouting and start talking.
p431

VI don't speak English.
p5
aVI start speaking English, learning English, about a year ago.
p6
aVI speak French and I grew up with French, so my English is Franglais.
p7
aVI'm born in the Western Congo, in an area around here,
p8
aVand then went to university in Kisangani.
p9
aVAnd after I finished, I went to this area, the Ituri Forest.
p10
aVBut what I've been doing \u2014
p11
aVwhen I was about 14, I grew in my uncle's house.
p12
aVAnd my father was a soldier,
p13
aVand my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher.
p14
aVWhat I've been doing from 14 to 17 was,
p15
aVI was assisting them collecting ivory tusk, meat
p16
aVand whatever they were killing, poaching, hunting in the forest,
p17
aVbring it in the main city to get access to the market.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut finally, I got myself involved.
p20
aVAround 17 to 20 years, I became, myself, a poacher.
p21
aVAnd I wanted to do it, because \u2014 I believed \u2014 to continue my studies.
p22
aVI wanted to go to university, but my father was poor, my uncle even.
p23
aVSo, I did it.
p24
aVAnd for three to four years, I went to university.
p25
aVFor three times, I applied to biomedical science, to be a doctor.
p26
aVI didn't succeed.
p27
aVI was having my inscriptions, my admission to biology.
p28
aVAnd I said, "No way, I'm not doing it.
p29
aVMy family's poor, my area don't have better health care.
p30
aVI want to be a doctor to serve them."
p31
aVThree times, that means three years, and I start getting old.
p32
aVI say, "Oh, no, I continue."
p33
aVSo, I did tropical ecology and plant botany.
p34
aVWhen I finished, I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship.
p35
aVIt's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing
p36
aVright up to now \u2014 I'm standing in front of you \u2014
p37
aVdoing botany and wildlife conservation.
p38
aa(lp39
VThat time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve
p40
aVwith some animals and also plants.
p41
aVAnd the training center there was built
p42
aVaround the scientific Congolese staff
p43
aVand some American scientists also.
p44
aVSo, the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number \u2014
p45
aVI think that is the largest number of elephants
p46
aVwe have right now in protected areas in Congo.
p47
aVIt has also chimpanzees.
p48
aVAnd it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve
p49
aVbecause of this beautiful creature.
p50
aVThat is a forest giraffe.
p51
aVI think you guys know it quite well.
p52
aVHere we have savanna giraffes,
p53
aVbut through evolution we have this forest giraffe
p54
aVthat lives only in Congo.
p55
aVIt has also some beautiful primates.
p56
aVThirteen species \u2014 highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa.
p57
aVAnd it has the Ituri Forest itself \u2014
p58
aVabout 1,300 species of plants, so far known.
p59
aa(lp60
VI joined the Wildlife Conservation Society, working there, in 1995,
p61
aVbut I started working with them as a student in 1991.
p62
aVI was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university
p63
aVbecause I accomplished with honor.
p64
aVBut I didn't like the way \u2014 the instruction I got was very poor.
p65
aVAnd I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center.
p66
aVWith the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko,
p67
aVthat most of you know, life became very, very difficult.
p68
aVAnd the work we have been doing
p69
aVwas completely difficult to do and to achieve it.
p70
aa(lp71
VWhen Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo,
p72
aVso Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated.
p73
aVSo they started fleeing from the east to the west.
p74
aVAnd the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there,
p75
aVso there was a road from Goma, somewhere here,
p76
aVand coming like this.
p77
aVSo they might go through, pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve.
p78
aVCongo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area,
p79
aVand the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them.
p80
aVSo soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve.
p81
aVOn their way, they looted everything.
p82
aVTorture, wars \u2014 oh, my God, you can't believe.
p83
aVEvery person was looking his way \u2014 where to go, we don't know.
p84
aVAnd it was for us, the young, the first time really
p85
aVwe hear the language of war, of guns.
p86
aVAnd even people who faced the rebellion of 1963,
p87
aVafter our independence, they didn't believe what was happening.
p88
aVThey were killing people. They were doing whatever they want
p89
aVbecause they have power.
p90
aVWho have been doing that?
p91
aVYoung children. Child soldiers.
p92
aVYou can't ask him how old he is because he has guns.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut I was from the west, working in the east.
p95
aVI even [at] that time was not speaking Swahili.
p96
aVAnd when they came, they looted everything.
p97
aVYou can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu,
p98
aVand everyone speaking Lingala is soldier.
p99
aVAnd I was from the same area to him.
p100
aVAll my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target.
p101
aVBut I'm not going to the east, because I don't know Swahili.
p102
aVI stay. If I go, I will be killed.
p103
aVI can't go back to my area \u2014 it's more than 1,000 kilometers [away].
p104
aa(lp105
VI stayed after they looted everything.
p106
aVWe have been doing research on botany,
p107
aVand we have a small herbarium of 4,500 sheets of plants.
p108
aVWe cut, we dry and we packed them,
p109
aVwe mounted them on a folder.
p110
aVPurpose: so that we start them for agriculture,
p111
aVfor medicine, for whatever, and for science,
p112
aVfor the study of the flora and the change of the forest.
p113
aVThat is people moving around, that's even Pygmies.
p114
aVAnd this is a bright guy, hard-working person, and Pygmy.
p115
aVI've been working with him about 10 years.
p116
aVAnd with soldiers, they went to the forest for poaching elephants.
p117
aVBecause he's Pygmy, he knows how to track elephants in the forest.
p118
aVHe has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest.
p119
aVThey came to told me, I have to save him.
p120
aVAnd what I did, I gave him just antibiotics
p121
aVthat we care for tuberculosis.
p122
aVAnd fortunately, I saved his life.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd that was the language of the war.
p125
aVEverywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral,
p126
aVkilling animals, the logging timbers and so on.
p127
aVAnd what of important things \u2014
p128
aVI think all of you here have a cell phone.
p129
aVThat mineral has killed a lot:
p130
aVfive millions of Congolese have gone because of this
p131
aVColombo-Tantalite \u2014 they call it Coltan \u2014
p132
aVthat they use it to make cell phones
p133
aVand it has been in that area, all over in Congo. Extraction,
p134
aVand good, big business of the war.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd what I did for the first war, after we have lost everything,
p137
aVI have to save something, even myself, my life and life of the staff.
p138
aVI buried some of our new vehicle engines, I buried it to save it.
p139
aVAnd some of equipment went with them,
p140
aVon the top of the canopy, to save it.
p141
aVHe's not collecting plants, he's going to save our equipment
p142
aVon the canopy.
p143
aVAnd with the material that's left \u2014
p144
aVbecause they wanted to destroy it, to burn it,
p145
aVthey didn't understand it, they didn't go to school \u2014
p146
aVI packed it.
p147
aVAnd that is me, going to, hurrying to Uganda,
p148
aVto try to save that 4,000 material,
p149
aVwith people carrying them on the bikes, bicycles.
p150
aVAnd after that, we succeeded.
p151
aVI housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.
p152
aVAnd after the war, I have been able to bring it back home,
p153
aVso that we continue our studies.
p154
aa(lp155
VThe second war came while we didn't expect it.
p156
aVWith friends, we had been sitting and watching match football,
p157
aVand having some good music with WorldSpace radio,
p158
aVwhen it started, I think.
p159
aVSo, it was so bad.
p160
aVWe heard that now from the east again the war started,
p161
aVand it's going fast.
p162
aVThis time I think Kabila will go in place of, as he did with Mobutu.
p163
aVAnd the reserve was a target to the rebels.
p164
aVThree different movements and two militia acting in the same area
p165
aVand competing for natural resources.
p166
aVAnd there was no way to work.
p167
aVThey destroy everything.
p168
aVPoaching \u2014 oh, no way.
p169
aVAnd that's the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them.
p170
aVWhat's the regulation of the reserve
p171
aVand what is the regulation of the parks?
p172
aVAnd they can't do what they are doing.
p173
aVSo we went to meet them.
p174
aVThat is Coltan extraction, gold mining.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo, we started talking with them,
p177
aVconvincing them that we are in a protected area.
p178
aVThere are regulations
p179
aVthat it's prohibited to do logging, mining and poaching, specifically.
p180
aVBut they said, "You guys,
p181
aVyou think that soldiers who are dying are not important,
p182
aVand your animals you are protecting are most important.
p183
aVWe don't think so.
p184
aVWe have to do it, because to let our movement advance."
p185
aVI say, "No way, you are not going to do it here."
p186
aVWe started talking with them and I was negotiating.
p187
aVTried to protect our equipment, tried to protect our staff
p188
aVand the villages of about 1,500 people.
p189
aVAnd we continued.
p190
aa(lp191
VBut I was doing that, negotiating with them.
p192
aVSometimes we are having meeting
p193
aVand they are talking with Jean-Pierre Bemba,
p194
aVwith Mbusa Nyamwisi, with Kabila, and I'm there.
p195
aVSometimes, they talk to my own language, that is, Lingala.
p196
aVI hear it and what strategy they are doing, what they are planning.
p197
aVSometimes, they are having a helicopter
p198
aVto supply them with ammunition and so on.
p199
aVThey used me to carry that, and I was doing counting,
p200
aVwhat comes from where, and where, and where.
p201
aVI had only this equipment \u2014 my satellite phone, my computer
p202
aVand a plastic solar panel \u2014 that I hide it in the forest.
p203
aVAnd every time, daily, after we have meeting,
p204
aVwhat compromise we have, whatever,
p205
aVI go, I write a short email, send it.
p206
aVI don't know how many people I had on my address.
p207
aVI sent the message: what is going about the progress of the war
p208
aVand what they are planning to do.
p209
aVThey started suspecting that what we do on the morning,
p210
aVand the afternoon, it's on the news, BBC, RFI.
p211
aV(Laughter)
p212
aVSomething might be going on.
p213
aVAnd one day, we went for a meeting.
p214
aV(Applause)
p215
aVSorry.
p216
aa(lp217
VOne day, we went to meet the Chief Commander.
p218
aVHe had the same iridium cell phone like me.
p219
aVAnd he asked me, "Do you know how to use this?"
p220
aVI said, "I have never seen it.
p221
aV(Laughter)
p222
aVI don't know."
p223
aVAnd I had mine on my pocket.
p224
aVSo, it was a chance that they trusted me a lot.
p225
aVThey didn't \u2014 they was not looking on me.
p226
aVSo I was scared.
p227
aVAnd when we finished the meeting, I went to return it in the forest.
p228
aVAnd I was sending news, doing whatever,
p229
aVreporting daily to the U.N., to UNESCO, to our institution in New York,
p230
aVwhat have been going.
p231
aVAnd for that, they have been having big pressure to leave, to free the area.
p232
aVBecause there was no way \u2014
p233
aVwhatever they do, it's known the same time.
p234
aa(lp235
VDuring the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo.
p236
aVWe have a zoo of 14 Okapis, and one of them was pregnant.
p237
aVAnd during the war, after a week of heavy war, fighting in the area,
p238
aVwe succeeded: we had the first Okapi.
p239
aVThis is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.
p240
aVThis is not local population, this is rebels.
p241
aVThey are now happy sending the news
p242
aVthat they have protected the Okapi with the war,
p243
aVbecause we sent the news that they are killing
p244
aVand poaching everywhere.
p245
aVAfter a week, we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi,
p246
aVthey killed an elephant, just 50 meters to the area
p247
aVwhere the zoo, where Okapi was born.
p248
aVAnd I was mad.
p249
aVI oppose it \u2014 that they are now going to dissect it,
p250
aVuntil I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander.
p251
aVAnd I succeeded.
p252
aVThe elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks.
p253
aa(lp254
VWhat we are doing after that \u2014 that was the situation of the war \u2014
p255
aVwe have to rebuild.
p256
aVI had some money. I was paid 150 dollars.
p257
aVI devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium,
p258
aVbecause we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants.
p259
aVWildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants.
p260
aVI started this with 70 dollars,
p261
aVand start fundraising money to where I've been going.
p262
aVI had opportunity to go all over,
p263
aVwhere herbarium for my African material is.
p264
aVAnd they supported me a bit, and I built this.
p265
aVNow, it's doing work to train young Congolese.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd also, what one of the speciality we are doing,
p268
aVmy design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity,
p269
aVand what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon.
p270
aVThis is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot,
p271
aVwhere we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters,
p272
aVand we are tracking them.
p273
aVWe have now data of about 15 years,
p274
aVto see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions.
p275
aVAnd that is \u2014 I think it's difficult for me.
p276
aVThis is a very embarrassing talk, I know.
p277
aVI don't know where to start, where to finish it.
p278
aa(lp279
VWhen I was thinking to come here,
p280
aVwhat best title I wanted to say to my talk, I didn't find this.
p281
aVBut now I think that I would have titled it, "The Language of Guns."
p282
aVWhere are you people?
p283
aVNow we are talking about reconstitution, rebuild Africa.
p284
aVBut is gun industries a tool to rebuild, or is it a game?
p285
aVI think we see the war like a game \u2014
p286
aVlike soccer, football.
p287
aVEverybody is happy, but see what it's doing,
p288
aVsee what is going in Darfur.
p289
aVNow we say, oh, my God.
p290
aVSee what the wars in Rwanda.
p291
aVThat's because of the language of guns.
p292
aVI don't think that someone may blame Google,
p293
aVbecause it's doing the right things,
p294
aVeven if people like Al-Qaeda are using Google
p295
aVto connect between them.
p296
aVBut it's serving millions for the best.
p297
aVBut what is doing with gun industries?
p298
aVThank you.
p299
aV(Applause)
p300
aa(lp301
VChris Anderson: Thank you, thank you.
p302
aVJust wait over there.
p303
aVIt's an amazing story.
p304
aVI suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have.
p305
aVHow can we help you?
p306
aa(lp307
VCorneille Ewango: That's really embarrassing questions.
p308
aVI think that now I feel nervous.
p309
aVAnd I think, helping us, people are acting sometimes by ignorance.
p310
aVI did it myself.
p311
aVIf I know when I was young,
p312
aVthat [by] killing an elephant, I'm destroying biodiversity,
p313
aVI would not have done it.
p314
aVMany, many of you have seen the talents of Africans,
p315
aVbut there are few who are going to school.
p316
aVMany are dying because of all those kind of pandemics,
p317
aVHIV, malaria, poverty, not going to school.
p318
aVWhat you can assist us, it's by building capacities.
p319
aVHow many have got opportunity like me
p320
aVto go to U.S., do a master's?
p321
aVAnd go \u2014 now, I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D.
p322
aVBut many of them are just here, because they don't have money.
p323
aVAnd they can't go even to university.
p324
aVThey can't even attain the bachelor's degree.
p325
aVBuilding capacities for the young generation
p326
aVis going to make a better generation
p327
aVand a better future tomorrow for Africa.
p328
aa(lp329
VCA: Thank you, thank you.

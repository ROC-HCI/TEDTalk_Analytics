VHi. I'm here to talk about congestion,
p5
aVnamely road congestion.
p6
aVRoad congestion is a pervasive phenomenon.
p7
aVIt exists in basically all of the cities all around the world,
p8
aVwhich is a little bit surprising when you think about it.
p9
aVI mean, think about how different cities are, actually.
p10
aVI mean, you have the typical European cities,
p11
aVwith a dense urban core, good public transportation
p12
aVmostly, not a lot of road capacity.
p13
aVBut then, on the other hand, you have the American cities.
p14
aVIt's moving by itself, okay.
p15
aVAnyway, the American cities:
p16
aVlots of roads dispersed over large areas,
p17
aValmost no public transportation.
p18
aVAnd then you have the emerging world cities,
p19
aVwith a mixed variety of vehicles,
p20
aVmixed land-use patterns, also rather dispersed
p21
aVbut often with a very dense urban core.
p22
aVAnd traffic planners all around the world have tried
p23
aVlots of different measures: dense cities or dispersed cities,
p24
aVlots of roads or lots of public transport
p25
aVor lots of bike lanes or more information,
p26
aVor lots of different things, but nothing seems to work.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut all of these attempts have one thing in common.
p29
aVThey're basically attempts at figuring out
p30
aVwhat people should do instead of rush hour car driving.
p31
aVThey're essentially, to a point, attempts at planning
p32
aVwhat other people should do, planning their life for them.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, planning a complex social system
p35
aVis a very hard thing to do, and let me tell you a story.
p36
aVBack in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell,
p37
aVan urban planner in London got a phone call
p38
aVfrom a colleague in Moscow saying, basically,
p39
aV"Hi, this is Vladimir. I'd like to know,
p40
aVwho's in charge of London's bread supply?"
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd the urban planner in London goes,
p43
aV"What do you mean, who's in charge of London's \u2014
p44
aVI mean, no one is in charge."
p45
aV"Oh, but surely someone must be in charge.
p46
aVI mean, it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this."
p47
aa(lp48
V"No. No. No one is in charge.
p49
aVI mean, it basically \u2014 I haven't really thought of it.
p50
aVIt basically organizes itself."
p51
aa(lp52
VIt organizes itself.
p53
aVThat's an example of a complex social system
p54
aVwhich has the ability of self-organizing,
p55
aVand this is a very deep insight.
p56
aVWhen you try to solve really complex social problems,
p57
aVthe right thing to do is most of the time
p58
aVto create the incentives.
p59
aVYou don't plan the details,
p60
aVand people will figure out what to do,
p61
aVhow to adapt to this new framework.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd let's now look at how we can use this insight
p64
aVto combat road congestion.
p65
aa(lp66
VThis is a map of Stockholm, my hometown.
p67
aVNow, Stockholm is a medium-sized city, roughly two million people,
p68
aVbut Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water
p69
aVmeans lots of bridges \u2014 narrow bridges, old bridges \u2014
p70
aVwhich means lots of road congestion.
p71
aVAnd these red dots show the most congested parts,
p72
aVwhich are the bridges that lead into the inner city.
p73
aVAnd then someone came up with the idea that,
p74
aVapart from good public transport,
p75
aVapart from spending money on roads,
p76
aVlet's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, one or two euros, that isn't really a lot of money,
p79
aVI mean compared to parking charges and running costs, etc.,
p80
aVso you would probably expect that car drivers
p81
aVwouldn't really react to this fairly small charge.
p82
aVYou would be wrong.
p83
aVOne or two euros was enough to make 20 percent of cars
p84
aVdisappear from rush hours.
p85
aVNow, 20 percent, well, that's a fairly huge figure, you might think,
p86
aVbut you've still got 80 percent left of the problem, right?
p87
aVBecause you still have 80 percent of the traffic.
p88
aVNow, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be
p89
aVa nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that
p90
aVonce you reach above a certain capacity threshold
p91
aVthen congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.
p92
aVBut fortunately, it also works the other way around.
p93
aVIf you can reduce traffic even somewhat, then congestion
p94
aVwill go down much faster than you might think.
p95
aVNow, congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm
p96
aVon January 3, 2006, and the first picture here is a picture
p97
aVof Stockholm, one of the typical streets, January 2.
p98
aVThe first day with the congestion charges looked like this.
p99
aVThis is what happens when you take away
p100
aV20 percent of the cars from the streets.
p101
aVYou really reduce congestion quite substantially.
p102
aa(lp103
VBut, well, as I said, I mean, car drivers adapt, right?
p104
aVSo after a while they would all come back because they
p105
aVhave sort of gotten used to charges.
p106
aVWrong again. It's now six and a half years ago
p107
aVsince the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm,
p108
aVand we basically have the same low traffic levels still.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut you see, there's an interesting gap here in the time series
p111
aVin 2007.
p112
aVWell, the thing is that, the congestion charges,
p113
aVthey were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced
p114
aVin January and then abolished again at the end of July,
p115
aVfollowed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced
p116
aVagain in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity.
p117
aVI mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with,
p118
aVand we actually got to do it twice.
p119
aVAnd personally, I would like to do this every once a year or so,
p120
aVbut they won't let me do that.
p121
aVBut it was fun anyway.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo, we followed up. What happened?
p124
aVThis is the last day with the congestion charges, July 31,
p125
aVand you see the same street but now it's summer,
p126
aVand summer in Stockholm is a very nice
p127
aVand light time of the year,
p128
aVand the first day without the congestion charges
p129
aVlooked like this.
p130
aVAll the cars were back again, and you even have to admire
p131
aVthe car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly.
p132
aVThe first day they all came back.
p133
aVAnd this effect hanged on. So 2007 figures looked like this.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow these traffic figures are really exciting
p136
aVand a little bit surprising and very useful to know,
p137
aVbut I would say that the most surprising slide here
p138
aVI'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one.
p139
aVThis shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm,
p140
aVand you see that when congestion pricing were introduced
p141
aVin the beginning of Spring 2006, people were fiercely against it.
p142
aVSeventy percent of the population didn't want this.
p143
aVBut what happened when the congestion charges
p144
aVwere there is not what you would expect, that people hated it more and more.
p145
aVNo, on the contrary, they changed, up to a point
p146
aVwhere we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges,
p147
aVmeaning that \u2014 I mean, let me repeat that:
p148
aV70 percent of the population in Stockholm
p149
aVwant to keep a price for something that used to be free.
p150
aa(lp151
VOkay. So why can that be? Why is that?
p152
aVWell, think about it this way. Who changed?
p153
aVI mean, the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared,
p154
aVsurely they must be discontent in a way.
p155
aVAnd where did they go? If we can understand this,
p156
aVthen maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this.
p157
aVWell, so we did this huge interview survey
p158
aVwith lots of travel services, and tried to figure out
p159
aVwho changed, and where did they go?
p160
aVAnd it turned out that they don't know themselves. (Laughter)
p161
aVFor some reason, the car drivers are \u2014
p162
aVthey are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do.
p163
aVAnd why is that? It's because that travel patterns
p164
aVare much less stable than you might think.
p165
aVEach day, people make new decisions, and people change
p166
aVand the world changes around them, and each day
p167
aVall of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly
p168
aVaway from rush hour car driving
p169
aVin a way that people don't even notice.
p170
aVThey're not even aware of this themselves.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd the other question, who changed their mind?
p173
aVWho changed their opinion, and why?
p174
aVSo we did another interview survey, tried to figure out
p175
aVwhy people changed their mind, and what type of group changed their minds?
p176
aVAnd after analyzing the answers, it turned out that
p177
aVmore than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds.
p178
aVThey're actually confident that they have
p179
aVliked congestion pricing all along.
p180
aVWhich means that we are now in a position
p181
aVwhere we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon
p182
aVwith 20 percent, and reduced congestion by enormous numbers,
p183
aVand people aren't even aware that they have changed,
p184
aVand they honestly believe that they have liked this all along.
p185
aa(lp186
VThis is the power of nudges when trying to solve
p187
aVcomplex social problems, and when you do that,
p188
aVyou shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt.
p189
aVYou should just nudge them in the right direction.
p190
aVAnd if you do it right,
p191
aVpeople will actually embrace the change,
p192
aVand if you do it right, people will actually even like it.
p193
aVThank you. (Applause)

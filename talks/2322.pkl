VIf you want to buy high-quality, low-price cocaine,
p5
aVthere really is only one place to go,
p6
aVand that is the dark net anonymous markets.
p7
aa(lp8
VNow, you can't get to these sites
p9
aVwith a normal browser \u2014 Chrome or Firefox \u2014
p10
aVbecause they're on this hidden part of the Internet,
p11
aVknown as Tor hidden services,
p12
aVwhere URLs are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in .onion,
p13
aVand which you access with a special browser
p14
aVcalled the Tor browser.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, the Tor browser was originally a U.S. Naval intelligence project.
p17
aVIt then became open source,
p18
aVand it allows anybody to browse the net
p19
aVwithout giving away their location.
p20
aVAnd it does this by encrypting your IP address
p21
aVand then routing it via several other computers around the world
p22
aVthat use the same software.
p23
aVYou can use it on the normal Internet,
p24
aVbut it's also your key to the dark net.
p25
aVAnd because of this fiendishly clever encryption system,
p26
aVthe 20 or 30 \u2014 we don't know exactly \u2014 thousand sites that operate there
p27
aVare incredibly difficult to shut down.
p28
aVIt is a censorship-free world visited by anonymous users.
p29
aa(lp30
VLittle wonder, then, that it's a natural place to go
p31
aVfor anybody with something to hide,
p32
aVand that something, of course, need not be illegal.
p33
aVOn the dark net, you will find
p34
aVwhistle-blower sites, The New Yorker.
p35
aVYou will find political activism blogs.
p36
aVYou will find libraries of pirated books.
p37
aVBut you'll also find the drugs markets,
p38
aVillegal pornography, commercial hacking services,
p39
aVand much more besides.
p40
aVNow, the dark net is one of the most interesting, exciting places
p41
aVanywhere on the net.
p42
aVAnd the reason is, because although innovation, of course,
p43
aVtakes place in big businesses,
p44
aVtakes place in world-class universities,
p45
aVit also takes place in the fringes,
p46
aVbecause those on the fringes \u2014 the pariahs, the outcasts \u2014
p47
aVthey're often the most creative, because they have to be.
p48
aVIn this part of the Internet,
p49
aVyou will not find a single lolcat,
p50
aVa single pop-up advert anywhere.
p51
aVAnd that's one of the reasons why I think
p52
aVmany of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VNot that I'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it
p57
aVto go and procure high-quality narcotics.
p58
aVBut let's say for a moment that you were.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VBear with me.
p63
aVThe first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites
p64
aVis how familiar it looks.
p65
aVEvery single product \u2014
p66
aVthousands of products \u2014
p67
aVhas a glossy, high-res image,
p68
aVa detailed product description, a price.
p69
aVThere's a "Proceed to checkout" icon.
p70
aVThere is even, most beautifully of all,
p71
aVa "Report this item" button.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VIncredible.
p76
aa(lp77
VYou browse through the site, you make your choice,
p78
aVyou pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin,
p79
aVyou enter an address \u2014  preferably not your home address \u2014
p80
aVand you wait for your product to arrive in the post,
p81
aVwhich it nearly always does.
p82
aVAnd the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption.
p83
aVThat's important.
p84
aVSomething far simpler than that.
p85
aVIt's the user reviews.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VYou see, every single vendor on these sites
p90
aVuses a pseudonym, naturally enough,
p91
aVbut they keep the same pseudonym to build up a reputation.
p92
aVAnd because it's easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want,
p93
aVthe only way of trusting a vendor
p94
aVis if they have a good history of positive feedback
p95
aVfrom other users of the site.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd this introduction of competition and choice
p98
aVdoes exactly what the economists would predict.
p99
aVPrices tend to go down, product quality tends to go up,
p100
aVand the vendors are attentive,
p101
aVthey're polite, they're consumer-centric,
p102
aVoffering you all manner of special deals, one-offs,
p103
aVbuy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,
p104
aVto keep you happy.
p105
aa(lp106
VI spoke to Drugsheaven.
p107
aVDrugsheaven was offering excellent and consistent marijuana
p108
aVat a reasonable price.
p109
aVHe had a very generous refund policy,
p110
aVdetailed T's and C's,
p111
aVand good shipping times.
p112
aa(lp113
V"Dear Drugsheaven," I wrote,
p114
aVvia the internal emailing system that's also encrypted, of course.
p115
aV"I'm new here. Do you mind if I buy just one gram of marijuana?"
p116
aa(lp117
VA couple of hours later, I get a reply.
p118
aVThey always reply.
p119
aa(lp120
V"Hi there, thanks for your email.
p121
aVStarting small is a wise thing to do. I would, too, if I were you."
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
V"So no problem if you'd like to start with just one gram.
p126
aVI do hope we can do business together.
p127
aVBest wishes, Drugsheaven."
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VI don't know why he had a posh English accent, but I assume he did.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, this kind of consumer-centric attitude
p134
aVis the reason why, when I reviewed 120,000 pieces of feedback
p135
aVthat had been left on one of these sites over a three-month period,
p136
aV95 percent of them were five out of five.
p137
aVThe customer, you see, is king.
p138
aVBut what does that mean?
p139
aVWell, on the one hand,
p140
aVthat means there are more drugs, more available, more easily,
p141
aVto more people.
p142
aVAnd by my reckoning, that is not a good thing.
p143
aVBut, on the other hand, if you are going to take drugs,
p144
aVyou have a reasonably good way
p145
aVof guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality,
p146
aVwhich is incredibly important if you're taking drugs.
p147
aVAnd you can do so from the comfort of your own home,
p148
aVwithout the risks associated with buying on the streets.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, as I said,
p151
aVyou've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace.
p152
aVAnd the 20 or so sites that are currently in operation \u2014
p153
aVby the way, they don't always work, they're not always perfect;
p154
aVthe site that I showed you was shut down 18 months ago,
p155
aVbut not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade.
p156
aVBut these markets,
p157
aVbecause of the difficult conditions in which they are operating,
p158
aVthe inhospitable conditions,
p159
aVare always innovating, always thinking of ways of getting smarter,
p160
aVmore decentralized, harder to censor,
p161
aVand more customer-friendly.
p162
aa(lp163
VLet's take the payment system.
p164
aVYou don't pay with your credit card,
p165
aVof course \u2014 that would lead directly back to you.
p166
aVSo you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,
p167
aVwhich is easily exchanged for real-world currencies
p168
aVand gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users.
p169
aa(lp170
VBut at the beginning of these sites, people noticed a flaw.
p171
aVSome of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples' bitcoin
p172
aVbefore they'd mailed the drugs out.
p173
aVThe community came up with a solution, called multi-signature escrow payments.
p174
aVSo on purchasing my item,
p175
aVI would send my bitcoin
p176
aVto a neutral, secure third digital wallet.
p177
aVThe vendor, who would see that I'd sent it,
p178
aVwould be confident that they could then send the product to me,
p179
aVand then when I received it,
p180
aVat least two of the three people engaged in the transaction \u2014
p181
aVvendor, buyer, site administrator \u2014
p182
aVwould have to sign the transaction off
p183
aVwith a unique digital signature,
p184
aVand then the money would be transferred.
p185
aa(lp186
VBrilliant!
p187
aVElegant.
p188
aVIt works.
p189
aa(lp190
VBut then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin,
p191
aVbecause every bitcoin transaction
p192
aVis actually recorded publicly in a public ledger.
p193
aVSo if you're clever, you can try and work out who's behind them.
p194
aVSo they came up with a tumbling service.
p195
aVHundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address,
p196
aVthey're tumbled and jumbled up,
p197
aVand then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients,
p198
aVbut they're different bitcoins:
p199
aVmicro-laundering systems.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VIt's incredible.
p204
aa(lp205
VInterested in what drugs are trending right now on the dark net markets?
p206
aVCheck Grams, the search engine.
p207
aVYou can even buy some advertising space.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VAre you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing?
p212
aVYeah.
p213
aVOne vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VThat's not being sourced from Colombian druglords,
p218
aVbut Guatemalan farmers.
p219
aVThey even promised to reinvest 20 percent of any profits
p220
aVinto local education programs.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VThere's even a mystery shopper.
p225
aa(lp226
VNow, whatever you think about the morality of these sites \u2014
p227
aVand I submit that it's not actually an easy question \u2014
p228
aVthe creation of functioning, competitive, anonymous markets,
p229
aVwhere nobody knows who anybody else is,
p230
aVconstantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities,
p231
aVis a staggering achievement,
p232
aVa phenomenal achievement.
p233
aVAnd it's that kind of innovation
p234
aVthat's why those on the fringes
p235
aVare often the harbingers of what is to come.
p236
aa(lp237
VIt's easy to forget
p238
aVthat because of its short life,
p239
aVthe Internet has actually changed many times
p240
aVover the last 30 years or so.
p241
aVIt started in the '70s as a military project,
p242
aVmorphed in the 1980s to an academic network,
p243
aVco-opted by commercial companies in the '90s,
p244
aVand then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties,
p245
aVbut I think it's going to change again.
p246
aVAnd I think things like the dark net markets \u2014
p247
aVcreative, secure, difficult to censor \u2014
p248
aVI think that's the future.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd the reason it's the future
p251
aVis because we're all worried about our privacy.
p252
aVSurveys consistently show concerns about privacy.
p253
aVThe more time we spend online, the more we worry about them,
p254
aVand those surveys show our worries are growing.
p255
aVWe're worried about what happens to our data.
p256
aVWe're worried about who might be watching us.
p257
aa(lp258
VSince the revelations from Edward Snowden,
p259
aVthere's been a huge increase in the number of people
p260
aVusing various privacy-enhancing tools.
p261
aVThere are now between two and three million daily users
p262
aVof the Tor browser,
p263
aVthe majority of which use is perfectly legitimate,
p264
aVsometimes even mundane.
p265
aVAnd there are hundreds of activists around the world
p266
aVworking on techniques and tools to keep you private online \u2014
p267
aVdefault encrypted messaging services.
p268
aVEthereum, which is a project which tries to link up
p269
aVthe connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world,
p270
aVto create a sort of distributed Internet that no one really controls.
p271
aVNow, we've had distributed computing before, of course.
p272
aVWe use it for everything from Skype to the search for extraterrestrial life.
p273
aVBut you add distributed computing and powerful encryption \u2014
p274
aVthat's very, very hard to censor and control.
p275
aVAnother called MaidSafe works on similar principles.
p276
aVAnother called Twister, and so on and so on.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd here's the thing \u2014
p279
aVthe more of us join,
p280
aVthe more interesting those sites become,
p281
aVand then the more of us join, and so on.
p282
aVAnd I think that's what's going to happen.
p283
aa(lp284
VIn fact, it's already happening.
p285
aVThe dark net is no longer a den for dealers
p286
aVand a hideout for whistle-blowers.
p287
aVIt's already going mainstream.
p288
aVJust recently, the musician Aphex Twin released his album as a dark net site.
p289
aVFacebook has started a dark net site.
p290
aVA group of London architects have opened a dark net site
p291
aVfor people worried about regeneration projects.
p292
aVYes, the dark net is going mainstream,
p293
aVand I predict that fairly soon, every social media company,
p294
aVevery major news outlet,
p295
aVand therefore most of you in this audience,
p296
aVwill be using the dark net, too.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo the Internet is about to get more interesting,
p299
aVmore exciting, more innovative,
p300
aVmore terrible,
p301
aVmore destructive.
p302
aVThat's good news if you care about liberty.
p303
aVIt's good news if you care about freedom.
p304
aVIt's good news if you care about democracy.
p305
aVIt's also good news
p306
aVif you want to browse for illegal pornography
p307
aVand if you want to buy and sell drugs
p308
aVwith impunity.
p309
aVNeither entirely dark, nor entirely light.
p310
aVIt's not one side or the other that's going to win out, but both.
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you very much, indeed.
p313

VI'm going to be talking to you
p5
aVabout how we can tap
p6
aVa really underutilized resource in health care,
p7
aVwhich is the patient,
p8
aVor, as I like to use the scientific term,
p9
aVpeople.
p10
aVBecause we are all patients, we are all people.
p11
aVEven doctors are patients at some point.
p12
aVSo I want to talk about that
p13
aVas an opportunity
p14
aVthat we really have failed to engage with very well in this country
p15
aVand, in fact, worldwide.
p16
aVIf you want to get at the big part \u2014
p17
aVI mean from a public health level, where my training is \u2014
p18
aVyou're looking at behavioral issues.
p19
aVYou're looking at things where people are actually given information,
p20
aVand they're not following through with it.
p21
aVIt's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes,
p22
aVobesity, many forms of heart disease,
p23
aVeven some forms of cancer \u2014 when you think of smoking.
p24
aVThose are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.
p25
aVThey know what they're supposed to be doing,
p26
aVbut they're not doing it.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow behavior change is something
p29
aVthat is a long-standing problem in medicine.
p30
aVIt goes all the way back to Aristotle.
p31
aVAnd doctors hate it, right?
p32
aVI mean, they complain about it all the time.
p33
aVWe talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance.
p34
aVWhen people don't take their pills,
p35
aVwhen people don't follow doctors' orders \u2014
p36
aVthese are behavior problems.
p37
aVBut for as much as clinical medicine
p38
aVagonizes over behavior change,
p39
aVthere's not a lot of work done
p40
aVin terms of trying to fix that problem.
p41
aVSo the crux of it
p42
aVcomes down to this notion of decision-making \u2014
p43
aVgiving information to people in a form
p44
aVthat doesn't just educate them
p45
aVor inform them,
p46
aVbut actually leads them to make better decisions,
p47
aVbetter choices in their lives.
p48
aa(lp49
VOne part of medicine, though,
p50
aVhas faced the problem of behavior change pretty well,
p51
aVand that's dentistry.
p52
aVDentistry might seem \u2014 and I think it is \u2014
p53
aVmany dentists would have to acknowledge
p54
aVit's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine.
p55
aVNot a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry.
p56
aVBut they have really taken this problem of behavior change
p57
aVand solved it.
p58
aVIt's the one great preventive health success
p59
aVwe have in our health care system.
p60
aVPeople brush and floss their teeth.
p61
aVThey don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo I'm going to talk about one experiment
p64
aVthat a few dentists in Connecticut
p65
aVcooked up about 30 years ago.
p66
aVSo this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one,
p67
aVbecause it was very simple,
p68
aVso it's an easy story to tell.
p69
aVSo these Connecticut dentists decided
p70
aVthat they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often,
p71
aVand they were going to use one variable:
p72
aVthey wanted to scare them.
p73
aVThey wanted to tell them how bad it would be
p74
aVif they didn't brush and floss their teeth.
p75
aVThey had a big patient population.
p76
aVThey divided them up into two groups.
p77
aVThey had a low-fear population,
p78
aVwhere they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation,
p79
aVall based in science,
p80
aVbut told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth,
p81
aVyou could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth,
p82
aVbut you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad.
p83
aVSo that was the low-fear group.
p84
aVThe high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.
p85
aVThey showed bloody gums.
p86
aVThey showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.
p87
aVThey told them that their teeth were going to fall out.
p88
aVThey said that they could have infections
p89
aVthat would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies,
p90
aVand ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth.
p91
aVThey would get dentures, and if you got dentures,
p92
aVyou weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob,
p93
aVyou weren't going to be able to eat apples,
p94
aVyou weren't going to be able to eat steak.
p95
aVYou'll eat mush for the rest of your life.
p96
aVSo go brush and floss your teeth.
p97
aVThat was the message. That was the experiment.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow they measured one other variable.
p100
aVThey wanted to capture one other variable,
p101
aVwhich was the patients' sense of efficacy.
p102
aVThis was the notion of whether the patients felt
p103
aVthat they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.
p104
aVSo they asked them at the beginning,
p105
aV"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?"
p106
aVAnd the people who said, "Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,"
p107
aVthey were characterized as high efficacy,
p108
aVand the people who said,
p109
aV"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,"
p110
aVthey were characterized as low efficacy.
p111
aVSo the upshot was this.
p112
aVThe upshot of this experiment
p113
aVwas that fear was not really a primary driver
p114
aVof the behavior at all.
p115
aVThe people who brushed and flossed their teeth
p116
aVwere not necessarily the people
p117
aVwho were really scared about what would happen \u2014
p118
aVit's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity
p119
aVto change their behavior.
p120
aVSo fear showed up as not really the driver.
p121
aVIt was the sense of efficacy.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo I want to isolate this,
p124
aVbecause it was a great observation \u2014
p125
aV30 years ago, right, 30 years ago \u2014
p126
aVand it's one that's laid fallow in research.
p127
aVIt was a notion that really came out
p128
aVof Albert Bandura's work,
p129
aVwho studied whether
p130
aVpeople could get a sense of empowerment.
p131
aVThe notion of efficacy basically boils down to one \u2014 that
p132
aVif somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.
p133
aVIn health care terms, you could characterize this
p134
aVas whether or not somebody feels
p135
aVthat they see a path towards better health,
p136
aVthat they can actually see their way towards getting better health,
p137
aVand that's a very important notion.
p138
aVIt's an amazing notion.
p139
aVWe don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well.
p140
aVExcept, maybe we do.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.
p143
aVAnd this is a great example
p144
aVof how we haven't learned that lesson at all.
p145
aVThis is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association.
p146
aVThis is still the way we're communicating messages about health.
p147
aVI mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night,
p148
aVand he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?"
p149
aVAnd I had to explain, "They're trying to scare people."
p150
aVAnd I don't know if it works.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow here's what does work:
p153
aVpersonalized information works.
p154
aVAgain, Bandura recognized this
p155
aVyears ago, decades ago.
p156
aVWhen you give people specific information
p157
aVabout their health, where they stand,
p158
aVand where they want to get to, where they might get to,
p159
aVthat path, that notion of a path \u2014
p160
aVthat tends to work for behavior change.
p161
aVSo let me just spool it out a little bit.
p162
aVSo you start with personalized data, personalized information
p163
aVthat comes from an individual,
p164
aVand then you need to connect it to their lives.
p165
aVYou need to connect it to their lives,
p166
aVhopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.
p167
aVOkay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated.
p168
aVAnd that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers \u2014
p169
aVthis overload of health information
p170
aVthat we're inundated with.
p171
aVBut it actually hits home.
p172
aVIt's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts.
p173
aVThere's an emotional connection to information
p174
aVbecause it's from us.
p175
aVThat information then needs to be connected to choices,
p176
aVneeds to be connected to a range of options,
p177
aVdirections that we might go to \u2014
p178
aVtrade-offs, benefits.
p179
aVFinally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action.
p180
aVWe need to connect the information
p181
aValways with the action,
p182
aVand then that action feeds back
p183
aVinto different information,
p184
aVand it creates, of course, a feedback loop.
p185
aa(lp186
VNow this is a very well-observed and well-established notion
p187
aVfor behavior change.
p188
aVBut the problem is that things \u2014 in the upper-right corner there \u2014
p189
aVpersonalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by.
p190
aVIt's a difficult and expensive commodity,
p191
aVuntil now.
p192
aVSo I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.
p193
aVSo we've all seen these. These are the "your speed limit" signs.
p194
aVYou've seen them all around,
p195
aVespecially these days as radars are cheaper.
p196
aVAnd here's how they work in the feedback loop.
p197
aVSo you start with the personalized data
p198
aVwhere the speed limit on the road that you are at that point
p199
aVis 25,
p200
aVand, of course, you're going faster than that.
p201
aVWe always are. We're always going above the speed limit.
p202
aVThe choice in this case is pretty simple.
p203
aVWe either keep going fast, or we slow down.
p204
aVWe should probably slow down,
p205
aVand that point of action is probably now.
p206
aVWe should take our foot off the pedal right now,
p207
aVand generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective
p208
aVin terms of getting people to slow down.
p209
aVThey reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.
p210
aVThey last for about five miles,
p211
aVin which case we put our foot back on the pedal.
p212
aVBut it works, and it even has some health repercussions.
p213
aVYour blood pressure might drop a little bit.
p214
aVMaybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut by and large, this is a feedback loop
p217
aVthat's so nifty and too rare.
p218
aVBecause in health care, most health care,
p219
aVthe data is very removed from the action.
p220
aVIt's very difficult to line things up so neatly.
p221
aVBut we have an opportunity.
p222
aVSo I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about
p223
aVhow we deliver health information in this country,
p224
aVhow we actually get information.
p225
aVThis is a pharmaceutical ad.
p226
aVActually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.
p227
aVNobody's had the brilliant idea
p228
aVof calling their drug Havidol quite yet.
p229
aVBut it looks completely right.
p230
aVSo it's exactly the way we get
p231
aVhealth information and pharmaceutical information,
p232
aVand it just sounds perfect.
p233
aVAnd then we turn the page of the magazine,
p234
aVand we see this \u2014
p235
aVnow this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies
p236
aVto put into their ads, or to follow their ads,
p237
aVand to me, this is one of the most  cynical exercises in medicine.
p238
aVBecause we know.
p239
aVWho among us would actually say that people read this?
p240
aVAnd who among us would actually say
p241
aVthat people who do try to read this
p242
aVactually get anything out of it?
p243
aVThis is a bankrupt effort
p244
aVat communicating health information.
p245
aVThere is no good faith in this.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo this is a different approach.
p248
aVThis is an approach that has been developed
p249
aVby a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School,
p250
aVLisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin.
p251
aVAnd they created this thing called the "drug facts box."
p252
aVThey took inspiration from, of all things,
p253
aVCap'n Crunch.
p254
aVThey went to the nutritional information box
p255
aVand saw that what works for cereal, works for our food,
p256
aVactually helps people understand what's in their food.
p257
aVGod forbid we should use that same standard
p258
aVthat we make Cap'n Crunch live by
p259
aVand bring it to drug companies.
p260
aVSo let me just walk through this quickly.
p261
aVIt says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for,
p262
aVso you can start to personalize your understanding
p263
aVof whether the information is relevant to you
p264
aVor whether the drug is relevant to you.
p265
aVYou can understand exactly what the benefits are.
p266
aVIt isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what,
p267
aVbut you get the statistics for how effective it is.
p268
aVAnd finally, you understand what those choices are.
p269
aVYou can start to unpack the choices involved
p270
aVbecause of the side effects.
p271
aVEvery time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect.
p272
aVSo it spells those out in very clean terms,
p273
aVand that works.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo I love this. I love that drug facts box.
p276
aVAnd so I was thinking about,
p277
aVwhat's an opportunity that I could have
p278
aVto help people understand information?
p279
aVWhat's another latent body of information that's out there
p280
aVthat people are really not putting to use?
p281
aVAnd so I came up with this: lab test results.
p282
aVBlood test results are this great source of information.
p283
aVThey're packed with information.
p284
aVThey're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.
p285
aVThey go right to doctors.
p286
aVAnd God forbid \u2014 I think many doctors, if you really asked them,
p287
aVthey don't really understand all this stuff either.
p288
aVThis is the worst presented information.
p289
aVYou ask Tufte, and he would say,
p290
aV"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible."
p291
aa(lp292
VWhat we did at Wired
p293
aVwas we went, and I got our graphic design department
p294
aVto re-imagine these lab reports.
p295
aVSo that's what I want to walk you through.
p296
aVSo this is the general blood work before,
p297
aVand this is the after, this is what we came up with.
p298
aVThe after takes what was four pages \u2014
p299
aVthat previous slide was actually
p300
aVthe first of four pages of data
p301
aVthat's just the general blood work.
p302
aVIt goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.
p303
aVThis is our one-page summary.
p304
aVWe use the notion of color.
p305
aVIt's an amazing notion that color could be used.
p306
aVSo on the top-level you have your overall results,
p307
aVthe things that might jump out at you from the fine print.
p308
aVThen you can drill down
p309
aVand understand how actually we put your level in context,
p310
aVand we use color to illustrate
p311
aVexactly where your value falls.
p312
aVIn this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes
p313
aVbecause of their glucose level.
p314
aa(lp315
VLikewise, you can go over your lipids
p316
aVand, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is
p317
aVand then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.
p318
aVBut again, always using color
p319
aVand personalized proximity
p320
aVto that information.
p321
aVAll those other values,
p322
aVall those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing,
p323
aVwe summarize.
p324
aVWe tell you that you're okay, you're normal.
p325
aVBut you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk.
p326
aVAnd then we do two other very important things
p327
aVthat kind of help fill in this feedback loop:
p328
aVwe help people understand in a little more detail
p329
aVwhat these values are and what they might indicate.
p330
aVAnd then we go a further step \u2014 we tell them what they can do.
p331
aVWe give them some insight
p332
aVinto what choices they can make, what actions they can take.
p333
aVSo that's our general blood work test.
p334
aa(lp335
VThen we went to CRP test.
p336
aVIn this case, it's a sin of omission.
p337
aVThey have this huge amount of space,
p338
aVand they don't use it for anything, so we do.
p339
aVNow the CRP test is often done
p340
aVfollowing a cholesterol test,
p341
aVor in conjunction with a cholesterol test.
p342
aVSo we take the bold step
p343
aVof putting the cholesterol information on the same page,
p344
aVwhich is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.
p345
aVSo we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well.
p346
aVIt's a protein that shows up
p347
aVwhen your blood vessels might be inflamed,
p348
aVwhich might be a risk for heart disease.
p349
aVWhat you're actually measuring
p350
aVis spelled out in clean language.
p351
aVThen we use the information
p352
aVthat's already in the lab report.
p353
aVWe use the person's age and their gender
p354
aVto start to fill in the personalized risks.
p355
aVSo we start to use the data we have
p356
aVto run a very simple calculation
p357
aVthat's on all sorts of online calculators
p358
aVto get a sense of what the actual risk is.
p359
aa(lp360
VThe last one I'll show you is a PSA test.
p361
aVHere's the before, and here's the after.
p362
aVNow a lot of our effort on this one \u2014
p363
aVas many of you probably know,
p364
aVa PSA test is a very controversial test.
p365
aVIt's used to test for prostate cancer,
p366
aVbut there are all sorts of reasons
p367
aVwhy your prostate might be enlarged.
p368
aVAnd so we spent a good deal of our time
p369
aVindicating that.
p370
aVWe again personalized the risks.
p371
aVSo this patient is in their 50s,
p372
aVso we can actually give them a very precise estimate
p373
aVof what their risk for prostate cancer is.
p374
aVIn this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.
p375
aVAnd then again, the follow-up actions.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.
p378
aVThat's what Wired magazine spent on this.
p379
aVWhy is Wired magazine doing this?
p380
aV(Laughter)
p381
aVQuest Diagnostics and LabCorp,
p382
aVthe two largest lab testing companies \u2014
p383
aVlast year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars
p384
aVand over 500 million dollars respectively.
p385
aVNow this is not a problem of resources;
p386
aVthis is a problem of incentives.
p387
aVWe need to recognize that the target of this information
p388
aVshould not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company.
p389
aVIt should be the patient.
p390
aVIt's the person who actually, in the end,
p391
aVis going to be having to change their lives
p392
aVand then start adopting new behaviors.
p393
aa(lp394
VThis is information that is incredibly powerful.
p395
aVIt's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.
p396
aVBut we're not using it. It's just sitting there.
p397
aVIt's being lost.
p398
aVSo I want to just offer four questions
p399
aVthat every patient should ask,
p400
aVbecause I don't actually expect people
p401
aVto start developing these lab test reports.
p402
aVBut you can create your own feedback loop.
p403
aVAnybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions:
p404
aVCan I have my results?
p405
aVAnd the only acceptable answer is \u2014
p406
aV(Audience: Yes.) \u2014 yes.
p407
aVWhat does this mean? Help me understand what the data is.
p408
aVWhat are my options? What choices are now on the table?
p409
aVAnd then, what's next?
p410
aVHow do I integrate this information
p411
aVinto the longer course of my life?
p412
aa(lp413
VSo I want to wind up by just showing
p414
aVthat people have the capacity to understand this information.
p415
aVThis is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.
p416
aVYou do not need to have the education level of people in this room.
p417
aVOrdinary people are capable of understanding this information,
p418
aVif we only go to the effort of presenting it to them
p419
aVin a form that they can engage with.
p420
aVAnd engagement is essential here,
p421
aVbecause it's not just giving them information;
p422
aVit's giving them an opportunity to act.
p423
aVThat's what engagement is. It's different from compliance.
p424
aVIt works totally different from the way we talk about behavior
p425
aVin medicine today.
p426
aVAnd this information is out there.
p427
aa(lp428
VI've been talking today about latent information,
p429
aVall this information that exists in the system
p430
aVthat we're not putting to use.
p431
aVBut there are all sorts of other bodies of information
p432
aVthat are coming online,
p433
aVand we need to recognize the capacity of this information
p434
aVto engage people, to help people
p435
aVand to change the course of their lives.
p436
aa(lp437

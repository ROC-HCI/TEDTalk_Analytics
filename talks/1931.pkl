VI'm going to go off script
p5
aVand make Chris quite nervous here
p6
aVby making this audience participation.
p7
aVAll right. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. All right.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand
p10
aVif you've ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex.
p11
aVCould be the neighbors, hotel room,
p12
aVyour parents. Sorry.
p13
aVOkay. Pretty much everybody.
p14
aVNow raise your hand if the man was making
p15
aVmore noise than the woman.
p16
aVI see one guy there.
p17
aVIt doesn't count if it was you, sir.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVSo his hand's down. And one woman. Okay.
p20
aVSitting next to a loud guy.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow what does this tell us?
p23
aVIt tells us that human beings
p24
aVmake noise when they have sex,
p25
aVand it's generally the woman who makes more noise.
p26
aVThis is known as female copulatory vocalization
p27
aVto the clipboard crowd.
p28
aVI wasn't even going to mention this,
p29
aVbut somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here,
p30
aVand she is the world's most famous
p31
aVfemale copulatory vocalizer.
p32
aVSo I thought, got to talk about that.
p33
aVWe'll get back to that a little bit later.
p34
aa(lp35
VLet me start by saying human beings
p36
aVare not descended from apes,
p37
aVdespite what you may have heard. We are apes.
p38
aVWe are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo
p39
aVthan the African elephant is to the Indian elephant,
p40
aVas Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books.
p41
aVWe're more closely related to chimps and bonobos
p42
aVthan chimps and bonobos are related
p43
aVto any other primate \u2014
p44
aVgorillas, orangutans, what have you.
p45
aVSo we're extremely closely related to them,
p46
aVand as you'll see in terms of our behavior,
p47
aVwe've got some relationship as well.
p48
aVSo what I'm asking today, the question
p49
aVI want to explore with you today is,
p50
aVwhat kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality?
p51
aVNow, since Darwin's day there's been
p52
aVwhat Cacilda and I have called
p53
aVthe standard narrative of human sexual evolution,
p54
aVand you're all familiar with it,
p55
aVeven if you haven't read this stuff.
p56
aVThe idea is that, as part of human nature,
p57
aVfrom the beginning of our species' time,
p58
aVmen have sort of leased women's reproductive potential
p59
aVby providing them with certain goods and services.
p60
aVGenerally we're talking about meat, shelter, status,
p61
aVprotection, things like that.
p62
aVAnd in exchange, women have offered fidelity,
p63
aVor at least a promise of fidelity.
p64
aVNow this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship.
p65
aVThe war between the sexes is built right into our DNA, according to this vision. Right?
p66
aVWhat Cacilda and I have argued is that no,
p67
aVthis economic relationship,
p68
aVthis oppositional relationship,
p69
aVis actually an artifact of agriculture,
p70
aVwhich only arose about 10,000 years ago at the earliest.
p71
aVAnatomically modern human beings
p72
aVhave been around for about 200,000 years,
p73
aVso we're talking about five percent, at most,
p74
aVof our time as a modern, distinct species.
p75
aVSo before agriculture,
p76
aVbefore the agricultural revolution,
p77
aVit's important to understand that human beings
p78
aVlived in hunter-gatherer groups that are
p79
aVcharacterized wherever they're found in the world
p80
aVby what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism.
p81
aVThey not only share things,
p82
aVthey demand that things be shared:
p83
aVmeat, shelter, protection, all these things
p84
aVthat were supposedly being traded to women
p85
aVfor their sexual fidelity, it turns out,
p86
aVare shared widely among these societies.
p87
aVNow I'm not saying that our ancestors
p88
aVwere noble savages, and I'm not saying
p89
aVmodern day hunter-gatherers are noble savages either.
p90
aVWhat I'm saying is that this is simply
p91
aVthe best way to mitigate risk
p92
aVin a foraging context.
p93
aVAnd there's really no argument about this among anthropologists.
p94
aVAll Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality.
p95
aVSo we've argued that human sexuality
p96
aVhas essentially evolved, until agriculture,
p97
aVas a way of establishing and maintaining
p98
aVthe complex, flexible social systems, networks,
p99
aVthat our ancestors were very good at,
p100
aVand that's why our species has survived so well.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, this makes some people uncomfortable,
p103
aVand so I always need to take  a moment in these talks
p104
aVto say, listen,
p105
aVI'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous,
p106
aVbut I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers.
p107
aVThere were no strangers. Right?
p108
aVIn a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers.
p109
aVYou've known these people your entire life.
p110
aVSo I'm saying, yes, there were overlapping sexual relationships,
p111
aVthat our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships
p112
aVgoing on at any given moment in their adult lives.
p113
aVBut I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers.
p114
aVI'm not saying that they didn't love the people they were having sex with.
p115
aVAnd I'm not saying there was no pair-bonding going on.
p116
aVI'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd those of us who have chosen to be monogamous \u2014
p119
aVmy parents, for example, have been married
p120
aVfor 52 years monogamously,
p121
aVand if it wasn't monogamously, Mom and Dad,
p122
aVI don't want to hear about it\u2014
p123
aVI'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying
p124
aVthere's anything wrong with this.
p125
aVWhat I'm saying is that to argue
p126
aVthat our ancestors were sexual omnivores
p127
aVis no more a criticism of monogamy
p128
aVthan to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores
p129
aVis a criticism of vegetarianism.
p130
aVYou can choose to be a vegetarian,
p131
aVbut don't think that just because you've made that decision,
p132
aVbacon suddenly stops smelling good.
p133
aVOkay? So this is my point.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVThat one took a minute to sink in, huh?
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, in addition to being a great genius,
p138
aVa wonderful man, a wonderful husband,
p139
aVa wonderful father, Charles Darwin
p140
aVwas also a world-class Victorian prude.
p141
aVAll right? He was perplexed
p142
aVby the sexual swellings of certain primates,
p143
aVincluding chimps and bonobos,
p144
aVbecause these sexual swellings tend to provoke
p145
aVmany males to mate with the females.
p146
aVSo he couldn't understand why on Earth would the female have developed this thing
p147
aVif all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond, right?
p148
aVChimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this,
p149
aVbut chimps and bonobos mate
p150
aVone to four times per hour
p151
aVwith up to a dozen males per day
p152
aVwhen they have their sexual swellings.
p153
aVInterestingly, chimps have sexual swellings
p154
aVthrough 40 percent, roughly,
p155
aVof their menstrual cycle,
p156
aVbonobos 90 percent,
p157
aVand humans are among the only species on the planet
p158
aVwhere the female is available for sex
p159
aVthroughout the menstrual cycle,
p160
aVwhether she's menstruating, whether she's post-menopausal,
p161
aVwhether she's already pregnant.
p162
aVThis is vanishingly rare among mammals.
p163
aVSo it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality.
p164
aVNow, Darwin ignored the reflections
p165
aVof the sexual swelling in his own day,
p166
aVas scientists tend to do sometimes.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo what we're talking about is sperm competition.
p169
aVNow the average human ejaculate has about 300 million sperm cells,
p170
aVso it's already a competitive environment.
p171
aVThe question is whether these sperm are  competing against other men's sperm
p172
aVor just their own.
p173
aVThere's a lot to talk about in this chart.
p174
aVThe one thing I'll call your attention to right away
p175
aVis the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human.
p176
aVThat indicates female copulatory vocalization.
p177
aVJust look at the numbers.
p178
aVThe average human has sex
p179
aVabout 1,000 times per birth.
p180
aVIf that number seems high for some of you,
p181
aVI assure you it seems low for others in the room.
p182
aVWe share that ratio with chimps and bonobos.
p183
aVWe don't share it with the other three apes,
p184
aVthe gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon,
p185
aVwho are more typical of mammals,
p186
aVhaving sex only about a dozen times per birth.
p187
aVHumans and bonobos are the only  animals that have sex face-to-face
p188
aVwhen both of them are alive.
p189
aV(Laughter)
p190
aVAnd you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo
p191
aVall have external testicles, which in our book
p192
aVwe equate to a special fridge you have in the garage
p193
aVjust for beer.
p194
aVIf you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge
p195
aVin the garage, you expect a party to happen
p196
aVat any moment, and you need to be ready.
p197
aVThat's what the external testicles are.
p198
aVThey keep the sperm cells cool
p199
aVso you can have frequent ejaculations.
p200
aVI'm sorry. It's true.
p201
aVThe human, some of you will be happy to hear,
p202
aVhas the largest, thickest penis of any primate.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy.
p205
aVIt goes into anthropology as well.
p206
aVHistorical records are full of accounts of people
p207
aVaround the world who have sexual practices
p208
aVthat should be impossible
p209
aVgiven what we have assumed about human sexual evolution.
p210
aVThese women are the Mosuo from southwestern China.
p211
aVIn their society, everyone, men and women,
p212
aVare completely sexually autonomous.
p213
aVThere's no shame associated with sexual behavior.
p214
aVWomen have hundreds of partners.
p215
aVIt doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody gossips. It's not an issue.
p216
aVWhen the woman becomes pregnant,
p217
aVthe child is cared for by her,  her sisters, and her brothers.
p218
aVThe biological father is a nonissue.
p219
aVOn the other side of the planet, in the Amazon,
p220
aVwe've got many tribes which practice
p221
aVwhat anthropologists call partible paternity.
p222
aVThese people actually believe \u2014
p223
aVand they have no contact among them,
p224
aVno common language or anything,
p225
aVso it's not an idea that spread,
p226
aVit's an idea that's arisen around the world \u2014
p227
aVthey believe that a fetus is literally made
p228
aVof accumulated semen.
p229
aVSo a woman who wants to have a child
p230
aVwho's smart and funny and strong
p231
aVmakes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy,
p232
aVthe funny guy and the strong guy,
p233
aVto get the essence of each of these men into the baby,
p234
aVand then when the child is born,
p235
aVthese different men will come forward
p236
aVand acknowledge their paternity of the child.
p237
aVSo paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor
p238
aVin this society.
p239
aVSo there are all sorts of examples like this
p240
aVthat we go through in the book.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow, why does this matter?
p243
aVEdward Wilson says we need to understand
p244
aVthat human sexuality is first a bonding device
p245
aVand only secondarily procreation.
p246
aVI think that's true. This matters because
p247
aVour evolved sexuality is in direct conflict
p248
aVwith many aspects of the modern world.
p249
aVThe contradictions between what we're told
p250
aVwe should feel and what we actually do feel
p251
aVgenerates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering.
p252
aVMy hope is that a more accurate,
p253
aVupdated understanding of human sexuality
p254
aVwill lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves,
p255
aVfor each other,
p256
aVgreater respect for unconventional relationship configurations
p257
aVlike same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions,
p258
aVand that we'll finally put to rest the idea
p259
aVthat men have some innate, instinctive right
p260
aVto monitor and control women's sexual behavior.
p261
aV(Applause)
p262
aVThank you.
p263
aVAnd we'll see that it's not only gay people
p264
aVthat have to come out of the closet.
p265
aVWe all have closets we have to come out of. Right?
p266
aVAnd when we do come out of those closets,
p267
aVwe'll recognize that our fight is not with each other,
p268
aVour fight is with an outdated,  Victorian sense of human sexuality
p269
aVthat conflates desire with property rights,
p270
aVgenerates shame and confusion
p271
aVin place of understanding and empathy.
p272
aVIt's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus,
p273
aVbecause the truth is
p274
aVthat men are from Africa
p275
aVand women are from Africa.
p276
aa(lp277
VThank you.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Applause)
p280
aa(lp281
VChris Anderson: Thank you. Christopher Ryan: Thank you.
p282
aa(lp283
VCA: So a question.
p284
aVIt's so perplexing, trying to use arguments
p285
aVabout evolutionary history
p286
aVto turn that into what we ought to do today.
p287
aVSomeone could give a talk and say,
p288
aVlook at us, we've got these really sharp teeth
p289
aVand muscles and a brain that's really good
p290
aVat throwing weapons,
p291
aVand if you look at lots of societies around the world,
p292
aVyou'll see very high rates of violence.
p293
aVNonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism,
p294
aVbut it's not who you are.
p295
aVHow is that different
p296
aVfrom the talk you gave?
p297
aa(lp298
VCR: Well first of all, the evidence
p299
aVfor high levels of violence in prehistory
p300
aVis very debatable.
p301
aVBut that's just an example.
p302
aVCertainly, you know, lots of people say to me,
p303
aVjust because we lived a certain way in the past
p304
aVdoesn't mean we should live that  way now, and I agree with that.
p305
aVEveryone has to respond to the modern world.
p306
aVBut the body does have its inherent
p307
aVevolved trajectories.
p308
aVAnd so you could live on McDonald's and milkshakes,
p309
aVbut your body will rebel against  that. We have appetites.
p310
aVI think it was Schopenhauer who said,
p311
aVa person can do what they want
p312
aVbut not want what they want.
p313
aVAnd so what I'm arguing against
p314
aVis the shame that's associated with desires.
p315
aVIt's the idea that if you love your husband or wife
p316
aVbut you still are attracted to other people,
p317
aVthere's something wrong with you,
p318
aVthere's something wrong with your marriage,
p319
aVsomething wrong with your partner.
p320
aVI think a lot of families are fractured
p321
aVby unrealistic expectations
p322
aVthat are based upon this false vision of human sexuality.
p323
aVThat's what I'm trying to get at.
p324
aa(lp325
VCA: Thank you. Communicated powerfully. Thanks a lot.
p326
aa(lp327
VCR: Thank you, Chris. (Applause)

VHello. My name is Birke Baehr,
p5
aVand I'm 11 years old.
p6
aVI came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.
p7
aVFirst of all, I would like to say
p8
aVthat I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe
p9
aVall the marketing and advertising
p10
aVon TV, at public schools
p11
aVand pretty much everywhere else you look.
p12
aVIt seems to me like corporations
p13
aVare always trying to get kids, like me,
p14
aVto get their parents to buy stuff
p15
aVthat really isn't good for us or the planet.
p16
aVLittle kids, especially,
p17
aVare attracted by colorful packaging
p18
aVand plastic toys.
p19
aVI must admit, I used to be one of them.
p20
aVI also used to think that all of our food
p21
aVcame from these happy, little farms
p22
aVwhere pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.
p23
aa(lp24
VWhat I discovered was this is not true.
p25
aVI began to look into this stuff
p26
aVon the Internet, in books and in documentary films,
p27
aVin my travels with my family.
p28
aVI discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.
p29
aVFirst, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.
p30
aVThat is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory
p31
aVto do something not intended by nature \u2014
p32
aVlike taking the DNA of a fish
p33
aVand putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck.
p34
aVDon't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes,
p35
aVbut this is just creepy.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVThe seeds are then planted, then grown.
p38
aVThe food they produce have been proven
p39
aVto cause cancer and other problems in lab animals,
p40
aVand people have been eating food produced this way
p41
aVsince the 1990s.
p42
aVAnd most folks don't even know they exist.
p43
aVDid you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn
p44
aVhad developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity?
p45
aVThese include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.
p46
aVYet almost all the corn we eat
p47
aVhas been altered genetically in some way.
p48
aVAnd let me tell you,
p49
aVcorn is in everything.
p50
aVAnd don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations
p51
aVcalled CAFOS.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VConventional farmers use chemical fertilizers
p56
aVmade from fossil fuels
p57
aVthat they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.
p58
aVThey do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients
p59
aVfrom growing the same crop over and over again.
p60
aVNext, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables,
p61
aVlike pesticides and herbicides,
p62
aVto kill weeds and bugs.
p63
aVWhen it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground,
p64
aVor run off into our waterways,
p65
aVpoisoning our water too.
p66
aVThen they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer,
p67
aVso it can travel thousands of miles
p68
aVfrom where it's grown to the supermarkets.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo I ask myself,
p71
aVhow can I change? How can I change these things?
p72
aVThis is what I found out.
p73
aVI discovered that there's a movement for a better way.
p74
aVNow a while back,
p75
aVI wanted to be an NFL football player.
p76
aVI decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.
p77
aV(Applause)
p78
aVThank you.
p79
aVAnd that way I can have a greater impact on the world.
p80
aVThis man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer
p81
aVbecause he grows against the system.
p82
aVSince I'm home-schooled,
p83
aVI went to go hear him speak one day.
p84
aVThis man, this "lunatic farmer,"
p85
aVdoesn't use any pesticides, herbicides,
p86
aVor genetically modified seeds.
p87
aVAnd so for that, he's called crazy by the system.
p88
aa(lp89
VI want you to know that we can all make a difference
p90
aVby making different choices,
p91
aVby buying our food directly from local farmers,
p92
aVor our neighbors who we know in real life.
p93
aVSome people say organic or local food is more expensive,
p94
aVbut is it really?
p95
aVWith all these things I've been learning about the food system,
p96
aVit seems to me that we can either pay the farmer,
p97
aVor we can pay the hospital.
p98
aV(Applause)
p99
aVNow I know definitely which one I would choose.
p100
aVI want you to know that there are farms out there \u2014
p101
aVlike Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee \u2014
p102
aVwhose cows do eat grass
p103
aVand whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought.
p104
aVSometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer,
p105
aVso I can see up close and personal
p106
aVwhere the meat I eat comes from.
p107
aVI want you to know that I believe
p108
aVkids will eat fresh vegetables and good food
p109
aVif they know more about it and where it really comes from.
p110
aVI want you to know that there are farmers' markets
p111
aVin every community popping up.
p112
aVI want you to know that me, my brother and sister
p113
aVactually like eating baked kale chips.
p114
aVI try to share this everywhere I go.
p115
aa(lp116
VNot too long ago,
p117
aVmy uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.
p118
aVHe asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's
p119
aVor the sugarcoated flakes \u2014
p120
aVyou know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.
p121
aVMy little cousin told his dad
p122
aVthat he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal
p123
aVbecause Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.
p124
aVAnd that, my friends, is how we can make a difference
p125
aVone kid at a time.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo next time you're at the grocery store, think local,
p128
aVchoose organic, know your farmer and know your food.
p129
aVThank you.

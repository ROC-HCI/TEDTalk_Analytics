VOne billion people in the world today
p5
aVdo not have access to all-season roads.
p6
aVOne billion people.
p7
aVOne seventh of the Earth's population
p8
aVare totally cut off for some part of the year.
p9
aVWe cannot get medicine to them reliably,
p10
aVthey cannot get critical supplies,
p11
aVand they cannot get their goods to market
p12
aVin order to create a sustainable income.
p13
aVIn sub-Saharan Africa, for instance,
p14
aV85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season.
p15
aVInvestments are being made,
p16
aVbut at the current level,
p17
aVit's estimated it's going to take them
p18
aV50 years to catch up.
p19
aVIn the U.S. alone, there's more than four million
p20
aVmiles of roads, very expensive to build,
p21
aVvery expensive to maintain infrastructure,
p22
aVwith a huge ecological footprint,
p23
aVand yet, very often, congested.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo we saw this and we thought,
p26
aVcan there be a better way?
p27
aVCan we create a system using today's most advanced technologies
p28
aVthat can allow this part of the world to leapfrog
p29
aVin the same way they've done with mobile telephones
p30
aVin the last 10 years?
p31
aVMany of those nations have excellent telecommunications today
p32
aVwithout ever putting copper lines in the ground.
p33
aVCould we do the same for transportation?
p34
aa(lp35
VImagine this scenario.
p36
aVImagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali,
p37
aVand have a newborn in need of urgent medication.
p38
aVWhat would you do today?
p39
aVWell, you would place a request via mobile phone,
p40
aVand someone would get the request immediately.
p41
aVThat's the part that works.
p42
aVThe medication may take days to arrive, though,
p43
aVbecause of bad roads.
p44
aVThat's the part that's broken.
p45
aa(lp46
VWe believe we can deliver it within hours
p47
aVwith an electric autonomous flying vehicle
p48
aVsuch as this.
p49
aVThis can transport a small payload today, about two kilograms,
p50
aVover a short distance, about 10 kilometers,
p51
aVbut it's part of a wider network that may cover
p52
aVthe entire country, maybe even the entire continent.
p53
aVIt's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.
p54
aVIt's a network for a transportation of matter.
p55
aVWe call it Matternet.
p56
aa(lp57
VWe use three key technologies.
p58
aVThe first is electric autonomous flying vehicles.
p59
aVThe second is automated ground stations
p60
aVthat the vehicles fly in and out of
p61
aVto swap batteries and fly farther,
p62
aVor pick up or deliver loads.
p63
aVAnd the third is the operating system
p64
aVthat manages the whole network.
p65
aa(lp66
VLet's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail.
p67
aVFirst of all, the UAVs.
p68
aVEventually, we're going to be using all sorts of vehicles
p69
aVfor different payload capacities and different ranges.
p70
aVToday, we're using small quads.
p71
aVThese are able to transport two kilograms
p72
aVover 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes.
p73
aVCompare this with trying to trespass a bad road
p74
aVin the developing world,
p75
aVor even being stuck in traffic
p76
aVin a developed world country.
p77
aVThese fly autonomously.
p78
aVThis is the key to the technology.
p79
aVSo they use GPS and other sensors on board
p80
aVto navigate between ground stations.
p81
aVEvery vehicle is equipped with an automatic
p82
aVpayload and battery exchange mechanism,
p83
aVso these vehicles navigate to those ground stations,
p84
aVthey dock, swap a battery automatically,
p85
aVand go out again.
p86
aVThe ground stations are located on safe locations
p87
aVon the ground.
p88
aVThey secure the most vulnerable part of the mission,
p89
aVwhich is the landing.
p90
aVThey are at known locations on the ground,
p91
aVso the paths between them are also known,
p92
aVwhich is very important from a reliability perspective
p93
aVfrom the whole network.
p94
aVApart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles,
p95
aVeventually they're going to be becoming
p96
aVcommercial hubs where people can take out loads
p97
aVor put loads into the network.
p98
aVThe last component is the operating system
p99
aVthat manages the whole network.
p100
aVIt monitors weather data from all the ground stations
p101
aVand optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system
p102
aVto avoid adverse weather conditions,
p103
aVavoid other risk factors,
p104
aVand optimize the use of the resources
p105
aVthroughout the network.
p106
aa(lp107
VI want to show you what one of those flights
p108
aVlooks like.
p109
aVHere we are flying in Haiti last summer,
p110
aVwhere we've done our first field trials.
p111
aVWe're modeling here a medical delivery
p112
aVin a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake.
p113
aVPeople there love this.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd I want to show you
p116
aVwhat one of those vehicles looks like up close.
p117
aVSo this is a $3,000 vehicle.
p118
aVCosts are coming down very rapidly.
p119
aVWe use this in all sorts of weather conditions,
p120
aVvery hot and very cold climates,
p121
aVvery strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles.
p122
aVImagine if your life depended on this package,
p123
aVsomewhere in Africa
p124
aVor in New York City, after Sandy.
p125
aVThe next big question is, what's the cost?
p126
aa(lp127
VWell, it turns out that the cost to transport
p128
aVtwo kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle
p129
aVis just 24 cents.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy
p134
aVexpended for the flight is only two cents
p135
aVof a dollar today,
p136
aVand we're just at the beginning of this.
p137
aVWhen we saw this, we felt that this is something
p138
aVthat can have significant impact in the world.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo we said, okay, how much does it cost
p141
aVto set up a network somewhere in the world?
p142
aVAnd we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho
p143
aVfor transportation of HIV/AIDS samples.
p144
aVThe problem there is how do you take them
p145
aVfrom clinics where they're being collected
p146
aVto hospitals where they're being analyzed?
p147
aVAnd we said, what if we wanted to cover an area
p148
aVspanning around 140 square kilometers?
p149
aVThat's roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan.
p150
aVWell it turns out that the cost to do that there
p151
aVwould be less than a million dollars.
p152
aVCompare this to normal infrastructure investments.
p153
aVWe think this can be \u2014 this is the power
p154
aVof a new paradigm.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo here we are: a new idea
p157
aVabout a network for transportation
p158
aVthat is based on the ideas of the Internet.
p159
aVIt's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer,
p160
aVit's bidirectional, highly adaptable,
p161
aVwith very low infrastructure investment,
p162
aVvery low ecological footprint.
p163
aVIf it is a new paradigm, though,
p164
aVthere must be other uses for it.
p165
aVIt can be used perhaps in other places in the world.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo let's look at the other end of the spectrum:
p168
aVour cities and megacities.
p169
aVHalf of the Earth's population lives in cities today.
p170
aVHalf a billion of us live in megacities.
p171
aVWe are living through an amazing urbanization trend.
p172
aVChina alone is adding a megacity
p173
aVthe size of New York City every two years.
p174
aVThese are places that do have road infrastructure,
p175
aVbut it's very inefficient.
p176
aVCongestion is a huge problem.
p177
aVSo we think it makes sense in those places
p178
aVto set up a network of transportation
p179
aVthat is a new layer that sits between the road
p180
aVand the Internet,
p181
aVinitially for lightweight, urgent stuff,
p182
aVand over time, we would hope to develop this
p183
aVinto a new mode of transportation
p184
aVthat is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.
p185
aVIt's ultimately scalable
p186
aVwith a very small ecological footprint,
p187
aVoperating in the background 24/7,
p188
aVjust like the Internet.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo when we started this
p191
aVa couple of years ago now,
p192
aVwe've had a lot of people come up to us who said,
p193
aV"This is a very interesting but crazy idea,
p194
aVand certainly not something that you should
p195
aVengage with anytime soon."
p196
aVAnd of course, we're talking about drones, right,
p197
aVa technology that's not only unpopular in the West
p198
aVbut one that has become a very, very unpleasant
p199
aVfact of life for many living in poor countries,
p200
aVespecially those engaged in conflict.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo why are we doing this?
p203
aVWell, we chose to do this one
p204
aVnot because it's easy,
p205
aVbut because it can have amazing impact.
p206
aVImagine one billion people being connected
p207
aVto physical goods in the same way
p208
aVthat mobile telecommunications connected them
p209
aVto information.
p210
aVImagine if the next big network we built in the world
p211
aVwas a network for the transportation of matter.
p212
aVIn the developing world, we would hope
p213
aVto reach millions of people with better vaccines,
p214
aVreach them with better medication.
p215
aVIt would give us an unfair advantage against battling
p216
aVHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.
p217
aVOver time, we would hope it would become
p218
aVa new platform for economic transactions,
p219
aVlifting millions of people out of poverty.
p220
aVIn the developed world and the emerging world,
p221
aVwe would hope it would become a new mode
p222
aVof transportation that could help make our cities
p223
aVmore livable.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo for those that still believe that this is science fiction,
p226
aVI firmly say to you that it is not.
p227
aVWe do need to engage, though,
p228
aVin social fiction to make it happen.
p229
aa(lp230
VThank you.

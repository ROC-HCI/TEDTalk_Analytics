VWell, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet
p5
aVa remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with
p6
aVin the wild for the last 28 years.
p7
aa(lp8
VNow I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains
p9
aVand what they might be doing with all that brainpower
p10
aVin the wild.
p11
aVAnd we know they use some of that brainpower
p12
aVfor just living complicated lives,
p13
aVbut what do we really know about dolphin intelligence?
p14
aa(lp15
VWell, we know a few things.
p16
aVWe know that their brain-to-body ratio,
p17
aVwhich is a physical measure of intelligence,
p18
aVis second only to humans.
p19
aVCognitively, they can understand
p20
aVartificially-created languages.
p21
aVAnd they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors.
p22
aVAnd in some parts of the world, they use tools,
p23
aVlike sponges to hunt fish.
p24
aVBut there's one big question left:
p25
aVdo they have a language, and if so,
p26
aVwhat are they talking about?
p27
aa(lp28
VSo decades ago, not years ago,
p29
aVI set out to find a place in the world
p30
aVwhere I could observe dolphins underwater
p31
aVto try to crack the code of their communication system.
p32
aVNow in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky,
p33
aVso it's very hard to observe animals underwater,
p34
aVbut I found a community of dolphins that live
p35
aVin these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas
p36
aVwhich are just east of Florida.
p37
aVAnd they spend their daytime resting and socializing
p38
aVin the safety of the shallows, but at night,
p39
aVthey go off the edge and hunt in deep water.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, it's not a bad place to be a researcher, either.
p42
aVSo we go out for about five months every summer
p43
aVin a 20-meter catamaran, and we live, sleep and work
p44
aVat sea for weeks at a time.
p45
aVMy main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone,
p46
aVwhich is an underwater microphone, and this is so
p47
aVI can correlate sound and behavior.
p48
aVAnd most of our work's pretty non-invasive.
p49
aVWe try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water,
p50
aVsince we're actually observing them physically in the water.
p51
aVNow, Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species
p52
aVto work with for a couple of reasons.
p53
aVThey're born without spots, and they get spots with age,
p54
aVand they go through pretty distinct developmental phases,
p55
aVso that's fun to track their behavior.
p56
aVAnd by about the age of 15, they're fully spotted black and white.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow the mother you see here is Mugsy.
p59
aVShe's 35 years old in this shot,
p60
aVbut dolphins can actually live into their early 50s.
p61
aVAnd like all the dolphins in our community,
p62
aVwe photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots
p63
aVand nicks in her dorsal fin,
p64
aVand also the unique spot patterns
p65
aVas she matured over time.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up,
p68
aVand they use their teenage years to practice social skills,
p69
aVand at about the age of nine, the females
p70
aVbecome sexually mature, so they can get pregnant,
p71
aVand the males mature quite a bit later,
p72
aVat around 15 years of age.
p73
aVAnd dolphins are very promiscuous,
p74
aVand so we have to determine who the fathers are,
p75
aVso we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material
p76
aVout of the water and extracting DNA.
p77
aVSo what that means is, after 28 years,
p78
aVwe are tracking three generations,
p79
aVincluding grandmothers and grandfathers.
p80
aVNow, dolphins are natural acousticians.
p81
aVThey make sounds 10 times as high
p82
aVand hear sounds 10 times as high as we do.
p83
aVBut they have other communication signals they use.
p84
aVThey have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate.
p85
aVThey have taste, not smell.
p86
aVAnd they have touch.
p87
aVAnd sound can actually be felt in the water,
p88
aVbecause the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same.
p89
aVSo dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, we do know some things about how sounds are used
p92
aVwith certain behaviors.
p93
aVNow, the signature whistle is a whistle
p94
aVthat's specific to an individual dolphin, and it's like a name. (Dolphin whistling noises)
p95
aVAnd this is the best-studied sound,
p96
aVbecause it's easy to measure, really,
p97
aVand you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves
p98
aVare reuniting, for example.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnother well studied sound are echolocation clicks.
p101
aVThis is the dolphin's sonar. (Dolphin echolocation noises)
p102
aVAnd they use these clicks to hunt and feed.
p103
aVBut they can also tightly pack these clicks together
p104
aVinto buzzes and use them socially.
p105
aVFor example, males will stimulate a female
p106
aVduring a courtship chase.
p107
aVYou know, I've been buzzed in the water.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVDon't tell anyone. It's a secret.
p110
aVAnd you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VSo dolphins are also political animals,
p114
aVso they have to resolve conflicts.
p115
aV(Dolphin noises)
p116
aVAnd they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as
p117
aVtheir head-to-head behaviors when they're fighting.
p118
aVAnd these are very unstudied sounds
p119
aVbecause they're hard to measure.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow this is some video of a typical dolphin fight.
p122
aV(Dolphin noises)
p123
aVSo you're going to see two groups,
p124
aVand you're going to see the head-to-head posturing,
p125
aVsome open mouths,
p126
aVlots of squawking.
p127
aVThere's a bubble.
p128
aVAnd basically, one of these groups will kind of back off
p129
aVand everything will resolve fine,
p130
aVand it doesn't really escalate into violence too much.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose
p133
aVthat interact socially with the spotted dolphins.
p134
aVFor example, they babysit each other's calves.
p135
aVThe males have dominance displays that they use
p136
aVwhen they're chasing each other's females.
p137
aVAnd the two species actually form temporary alliances
p138
aVwhen they're chasing sharks away.
p139
aVAnd one of the mechanisms they use to communicate
p140
aVtheir coordination is synchrony.
p141
aVThey synchronize their sounds and their body postures
p142
aVto look bigger and sound stronger.
p143
aV(Dolphins noises)
p144
aVNow, these are bottlenose dolphins,
p145
aVand you'll see them starting to synchronize
p146
aVtheir behavior and their sounds.
p147
aV(Dolphin noises)
p148
aVYou see, they're synchronizing with their partner
p149
aVas well as the other dyad.
p150
aVI wish I was that coordinated.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, it's important to remember that you're only hearing
p153
aVthe human-audible parts of dolphin sounds,
p154
aVand dolphins make ultrasonic sounds,
p155
aVand we use special equipment in the water
p156
aVto collect these sounds.
p157
aVNow, researchers have actually measured whistle complexity
p158
aVusing information theory,
p159
aVand whistles rate very high relative to even human languages.
p160
aVBut burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow, these are three spectragrams.
p163
aVTwo are human words, and one is a dolphin vocalizing.
p164
aVSo just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin.
p165
aVNow, it turns out burst-pulsed sounds actually look
p166
aVa bit like human phonemes.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, one way to crack the code
p169
aVis to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean,
p170
aVbut it's a difficult job, and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet.
p171
aVBut a second way to crack the code
p172
aVis to develop some technology,
p173
aVan interface to do two-way communication,
p174
aVand that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas
p175
aVand in real time.
p176
aVNow, scientists have used keyboard interfaces
p177
aVto try to bridge the gap with species
p178
aVincluding chimpanzees and dolphins.
p179
aVThis underwater keyboard in Orlando, Florida,
p180
aVat the Epcot Center, was actually
p181
aVthe most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed
p182
aVfor humans and dolphins to work together under the water
p183
aVand exchange information.
p184
aVSo we wanted to develop an interface like this
p185
aVin the Bahamas, but in a more natural setting.
p186
aVAnd one of the reasons we thought we could do this
p187
aVis because the dolphins were starting to show us
p188
aVa lot of mutual curiosity.
p189
aVThey were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations
p190
aVand our postures, and they were also inviting us
p191
aVinto dolphin games.
p192
aVNow, dolphins are social mammals, so they love to play,
p193
aVand one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed,
p194
aVor sargassum in this case, around.
p195
aVAnd they're very adept. They like to drag it
p196
aVand drop it from appendage to appendage.
p197
aVNow in this footage, the adult is Caroh.
p198
aVShe's 25 years old here, and this is her newborn, Cobalt,
p199
aVand he's just learning how to play this game.
p200
aV(Dolphin noises)
p201
aVShe's kind of teasing him and taunting him.
p202
aVHe really wants that sargassum.
p203
aVNow, when dolphins solicit humans for this game,
p204
aVthey'll often sink vertically in the water,
p205
aVand they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper,
p206
aVand they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes
p207
aVon the bottom and let us go get it,
p208
aVand then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game.
p209
aVBut when we don't dive down and get it,
p210
aVthey'll bring it to the surface
p211
aVand they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail
p212
aVand drop it for us like they do their calves,
p213
aVand then we'll pick it up and have a game.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd so we started thinking, well, wouldn't it be neat
p216
aVto build some technology that would allow the dolphins
p217
aVto request these things in real time, their favorite toys?
p218
aVSo the original vision was to have a keyboard
p219
aVhanging from the boat attached to a computer,
p220
aVand the divers and dolphins would activate the keys
p221
aVon the keypad and happily exchange information
p222
aVand request toys from each other.
p223
aVBut we quickly found out that dolphins simply
p224
aVwere not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard.
p225
aVThey've got better things to do in the wild.
p226
aVThey might do it in captivity, but in the wild \u2014
p227
aa(lp228
VSo we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water,
p229
aVand we labeled four objects they like to play with,
p230
aVthe scarf, rope, sargassum, and also had a bow ride,
p231
aVwhich is a fun activity for a dolphin. (Whistle)
p232
aVAnd that's the scarf whistle,
p233
aVwhich is also associated with a visual symbol.
p234
aVAnd these are artificially created whistles.
p235
aVThey're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire,
p236
aVbut they're easily mimicked by the dolphins.
p237
aVAnd I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour,
p238
aVworking out in the field with this keyboard
p239
aVusing it with each other to do requests for toys
p240
aVwhile the dolphins were watching.
p241
aVAnd the dolphins could get in on the game.
p242
aVThey could point at the visual object,
p243
aVor they could mimic the whistle.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow this is video of a session.
p246
aVThe diver here has a rope toy,
p247
aVand I'm on the keyboard on the left,
p248
aVand I've just played the rope key,
p249
aVand that's the request for the toy from the human.
p250
aVSo I've got the rope, I'm diving down,
p251
aVand I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention,
p252
aVbecause they're kind of like little kids.
p253
aVYou have to keep their attention.
p254
aVI'm going to drop the rope, see if they come over.
p255
aVHere they come,
p256
aVand then they're going to pick up the rope
p257
aVand drag it around as a toy.
p258
aVNow, I'm at the keyboard on the left,
p259
aVand this is actually the first time that we tried this.
p260
aVI'm going to try to request this toy, the rope toy,
p261
aVfrom the dolphins using the rope sound.
p262
aVLet's see if they might actually understand what that means.
p263
aV(Whistle)
p264
aVThat's the rope whistle.
p265
aVUp come the dolphins,
p266
aVand drop off the rope, yay. Wow.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)
p269
aa(lp270
VSo this is only once.
p271
aVWe don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles.
p272
aVOkay, so here's a second toy in the water.
p273
aVThis is a scarf toy, and I'm trying to lead the dolphin
p274
aVover to the keyboard to show her
p275
aVthe visual and the acoustic signal.
p276
aVNow this dolphin, we call her "the scarf thief,"
p277
aVbecause over the years she's absconded
p278
aVwith about 12 scarves.
p279
aVIn fact, we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas.
p280
aVSo I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side.
p281
aVAnd we try to not touch the animals too much,
p282
aVwe really don't want to over-habituate them.
p283
aVAnd I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard.
p284
aVAnd the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound
p285
aVto request the scarf.
p286
aVSo I try to give her the scarf.
p287
aVWhoop. Almost lost it.
p288
aVBut this is the moment where everything becomes possible.
p289
aVThe dolphin's at the keyboard.
p290
aVYou've got full attention.
p291
aVAnd this sometimes went on for hours.
p292
aVAnd I wanted to share this video with you
p293
aVnot to show you any big breakthroughs,
p294
aVbecause they haven't happened yet,
p295
aVbut to show you the level of intention and focus
p296
aVthat these dolphins have, and interest in the system.
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd because of this, we really decided we needed
p299
aVsome more sophisticated technology.
p300
aVSo we joined forces with Georgia Tech,
p301
aVwith Thad Starner's wearable computing group,
p302
aVto build us an underwater wearable computer
p303
aVthat we're calling CHAT. [CHAT: Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry]
p304
aVNow, instead of pushing a keyboard through the water,
p305
aVthe diver's wearing the complete system, and it's acoustic only,
p306
aVso basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad
p307
aVon the forearm,
p308
aVthe sounds go out through an underwater speaker,
p309
aVif a dolphin mimics the whistle
p310
aVor a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in
p311
aVand are localized by two hydrophones.
p312
aVThe computer can localize who requested the toy
p313
aVif there's a word match.
p314
aVAnd the real power of the system is in the real-time
p315
aVsound recognition, so we can respond to the dolphins
p316
aVquickly and accurately.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd we're at prototype stage, but this is how we hope it will play out.
p319
aVSo Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer
p320
aVand the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle,
p321
aVthe diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water,
p322
aVbut also as a word through bone conduction.
p323
aVSo Diver A plays the scarf whistle
p324
aVor Diver B plays the sargassum whistle
p325
aVto request a toy from whoever has it.
p326
aVWhat we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle,
p327
aVand if Diver A has the sargassum, if that's the sound
p328
aVthat was played and requested,
p329
aVthen the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin
p330
aVand they'll swim away happily into the sunset
p331
aVplaying sargassum for forever.
p332
aa(lp333
VNow, how far can this kind of communication go?
p334
aVWell, CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins
p335
aVto request things from us.
p336
aVIt's designed to really be two-way.
p337
aVNow, will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally?
p338
aVWe hope so and we think so.
p339
aVBut as we decode their natural sounds,
p340
aVwe're also planning to put those back into the computerized system.
p341
aVFor example, right now we can put their own signature whistles
p342
aVin the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin.
p343
aVLikewise, we can create our own whistles,
p344
aVour own whistle names, and let the dolphins
p345
aVrequest specific divers to interact with.
p346
aa(lp347
VNow it may be that all our mobile technology
p348
aVwill actually be the same technology that helps us
p349
aVcommunicate with another species down the road.
p350
aVIn the case of a dolphin, you know, it's a species that,
p351
aVwell, they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways
p352
aVand we might not be able to admit that right now,
p353
aVbut they live in quite a different environment,
p354
aVand you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems.
p355
aa(lp356
VI mean, imagine what it would be like
p357
aVto really understand the mind
p358
aVof another intelligent species on the planet.
p359
aa(lp360
VThank you.
p361

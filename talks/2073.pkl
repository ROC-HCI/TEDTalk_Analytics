VSo recently,
p5
aVsome white guys and some black women
p6
aVswapped Twitter avatars, or pictures online.
p7
aVThey didn't change their content,
p8
aVthey kept tweeting the same as usual,
p9
aVbut suddenly, the white guys noticed
p10
aVthey were getting called the n-word all the time
p11
aVand they were getting the worst kind of online abuse,
p12
aVwhereas the black women all of a sudden
p13
aVnoticed things got a lot more pleasant for them.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, if you're my five-year-old,
p16
aVyour Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies
p17
aVand occasionally fairies riding puppies.
p18
aVThat's a thing. Google it.
p19
aVBut the rest of us know that the Internet
p20
aVcan be a really ugly place.
p21
aVI'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates
p22
aVthat I think are healthy for our democracy.
p23
aVI'm talking about nasty personal attacks.
p24
aVMaybe it's happened to you, but it's at least
p25
aVtwice as likely to happen, and be worse,
p26
aVif you're a woman, a person of color, or gay,
p27
aVor more than one at the same time.
p28
aVIn fact, just as I was writing this talk,
p29
aVI found a Twitter account called @SallyKohnSucks.
p30
aVThe bio says that I'm a
p31
aV"man-hater and a bull dyke and the only thing I've ever accomplished with my career
p32
aVis spreading my perverse sexuality."
p33
aVWhich, incidentally, is only a third correct.
p34
aVI mean, lies! (Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VBut seriously, we all say we hate this crap.
p37
aVThe question is whether you're willing to make
p38
aVa personal sacrifice to change it.
p39
aVI don't mean giving up the Internet.
p40
aVI mean changing the way you click,
p41
aVbecause clicking is a public act.
p42
aVIt's no longer the case
p43
aVthat a few powerful elites control all the media
p44
aVand the rest of us are just passive receivers.
p45
aVIncreasingly, we're all the media.
p46
aVI used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up,
p47
aVI put on a lot of makeup,
p48
aVI go on television, I talk about the news.
p49
aVThat is a public act of making media.
p50
aVAnd then I go home and I browse the web
p51
aVand I'm reading Twitter,
p52
aVand that's a private act of consuming media.
p53
aVI mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas.
p54
aVWrong.
p55
aVEverything we blog, everything we Tweet,
p56
aVand everything we click
p57
aVis a public act of making media.
p58
aVWe are the new editors.
p59
aVWe decide what gets attention
p60
aVbased on what we give our attention to.
p61
aVThat's how the media works now.
p62
aVThere's all these hidden algorithms that decide
p63
aVwhat you see more of and what we all see more of
p64
aVbased on what you click on,
p65
aVand that in turn shapes our whole culture.
p66
aa(lp67
VOver three out of five Americans think we have
p68
aVa major incivility problem in our country right now,
p69
aVbut I'm going to guess that at least three out of five
p70
aVAmericans are clicking on the same insult-oriented,
p71
aVrumor-mongering trash that feeds
p72
aVthe nastiest impulses in our society.
p73
aVIn an increasingly noisy media landscape,
p74
aVthe incentive is to make more noise to be heard,
p75
aVand that tyranny of the loud
p76
aVencourages the tyranny of the nasty.
p77
aa(lp78
VIt does not have to be that way.
p79
aVIt does not.
p80
aVWe can change the incentive.
p81
aVFor starters, there are two things we can all do.
p82
aVFirst, don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt.
p83
aVIf someone is being abused online, do something.
p84
aVBe a hero. This is your chance.
p85
aVSpeak up. Speak out. Be a good person.
p86
aVDrown out the negative with the positive.
p87
aVAnd second, we've got to stop clicking
p88
aVon the lowest-common-denominator, bottom-feeding
p89
aVlinkbait.
p90
aVIf you don't like the 24/7 all Kardashian
p91
aVall the time programming,
p92
aVyou've got to stop clicking on the stories
p93
aVabout Kim Kardashian's sideboob.
p94
aVI know you do it. (Applause)
p95
aVYou too, apparently.
p96
aVI mean, really, same example:
p97
aVif you don't like politicians calling each other names,
p98
aVstop clicking on the stories
p99
aVabout what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party.
p100
aVClicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it.
p101
aVIt makes it worse, the fire spreads.
p102
aVOur whole culture gets burned.
p103
aa(lp104
VIf what gets the most clicks wins,
p105
aVthen we have to start shaping the world we want
p106
aVwith our clicks,
p107
aVbecause clicking is a public act.
p108
aVSo click responsibly. Thank you.

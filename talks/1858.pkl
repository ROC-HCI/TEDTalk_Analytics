VI was about 10 years old
p5
aVon a camping trip with my dad
p6
aVin the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area
p7
aVin the northern part of New York State.
p8
aVIt was a beautiful day.
p9
aVThe forest was sparkling.
p10
aVThe sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,
p11
aVand if it weren't for the path we were following,
p12
aVwe could almost pretend we were
p13
aVthe first human beings to ever walk that land.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe got to our campsite.
p16
aVIt was a lean-to on a bluff
p17
aVlooking over a crystal, beautiful lake,
p18
aVwhen I discovered a horror.
p19
aVBehind the lean-to was a dump,
p20
aVmaybe 40 feet square
p21
aVwith rotting apple cores
p22
aVand balled-up aluminum foil,
p23
aVand a dead sneaker.
p24
aVAnd I was astonished,
p25
aVI was very angry, and I was deeply confused.
p26
aVThe campers who were too lazy
p27
aVto take out what they had brought in,
p28
aVwho did they think would clean up after them?
p29
aa(lp30
VThat question stayed with me,
p31
aVand it simplified a little.
p32
aVWho cleans up after us?
p33
aVHowever you configure
p34
aVor wherever you place the us,
p35
aVwho cleans up after us in Istanbul?
p36
aVWho cleans up after us in Rio
p37
aVor in Paris or in London?
p38
aVHere in New York,
p39
aVthe Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,
p40
aVto the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage
p41
aVand 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.
p42
aVI wanted to get to know them as individuals.
p43
aVI wanted to understand who takes the job.
p44
aVWhat's it like to wear the uniform
p45
aVand bear that burden?
p46
aa(lp47
VSo I started a research project with them.
p48
aVI rode in the trucks and walked the routes
p49
aVand interviewed people in offices and facilities
p50
aVall over the city,
p51
aVand I learned a lot,
p52
aVbut I was still an outsider.
p53
aVI needed to go deeper.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo I took the job as a sanitation worker.
p56
aVI didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.
p57
aVAnd I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.
p58
aVIt was a remarkable privilege
p59
aVand an amazing education.
p60
aa(lp61
VEveryone asks about the smell.
p62
aVIt's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,
p63
aVand on days when it is really bad,
p64
aVyou get used to it rather quickly.
p65
aVThe weight takes a long time to get used to.
p66
aVI knew people who were several years on the job
p67
aVwhose bodies were still adjusting to the burden
p68
aVof bearing on your body
p69
aVtons of trash every week.
p70
aa(lp71
VThen there's the danger.
p72
aVAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
p73
aVsanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous
p74
aVoccupations in the country,
p75
aVand I learned why.
p76
aVYou're in and out of traffic all day,
p77
aVand it's zooming around you.
p78
aVIt just wants to get past you, so it's often
p79
aVthe motorist is not paying attention.
p80
aVThat's really bad for the worker.
p81
aVAnd then the garbage itself is full of hazards
p82
aVthat often fly back out of the truck
p83
aVand do terrible harm.
p84
aa(lp85
VI also learned about the relentlessness of trash.
p86
aVWhen you step off the curb
p87
aVand you see a city from behind a truck,
p88
aVyou come to understand that trash
p89
aVis like a force of nature unto itself.
p90
aVIt never stops coming.
p91
aVIt's also like a form of respiration or circulation.
p92
aVIt must always be in motion.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd then there's the stigma.
p95
aVYou put on the uniform, and you become invisible
p96
aVuntil someone is upset with you for whatever reason
p97
aVlike you've blocked traffic with your truck,
p98
aVor you're taking a break too close to their home,
p99
aVor you're drinking coffee in their diner,
p100
aVand they will come and scorn you,
p101
aVand tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.
p102
aVI find the stigma especially ironic,
p103
aVbecause I strongly believe that sanitation workers
p104
aVare the most important labor force
p105
aVon the streets of the city, for three reasons.
p106
aVThey are the first guardians of public health.
p107
aVIf they're not taking away trash
p108
aVefficiently and effectively every day,
p109
aVit starts to spill out of its containments,
p110
aVand the dangers inherent to it threaten us
p111
aVin very real ways.
p112
aVDiseases we've had in check for decades and centuries
p113
aVburst forth again and start to harm us.
p114
aVThe economy needs them.
p115
aVIf we can't throw out the old stuff,
p116
aVwe have no room for the new stuff,
p117
aVso then the engines of the economy
p118
aVstart to sputter when consumption is compromised.
p119
aVI'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.
p120
aVAnd then there's what I call
p121
aVour average, necessary quotidian velocity.
p122
aVBy that I simply mean
p123
aVhow fast we're used to moving
p124
aVin the contemporary day and age.
p125
aVWe usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around
p126
aVour coffee cup, our shopping bag,
p127
aVour bottle of water.
p128
aVWe use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,
p129
aVbecause we know there's a workforce
p130
aVon the other side that's going to take it all away.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo I want to suggest today a couple of ways
p133
aVto think about sanitation that will perhaps help
p134
aVameliorate the stigma
p135
aVand bring them into this conversation
p136
aVof how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.
p137
aVTheir work, I think, is kind of liturgical.
p138
aVThey're on the streets every day, rhythmically.
p139
aVThey wear a uniform in many cities.
p140
aVYou know when to expect them.
p141
aVAnd their work lets us do our work.
p142
aVThey are almost a form of reassurance.
p143
aVThe flow that they maintain
p144
aVkeeps us safe from ourselves,
p145
aVfrom our own dross, our cast-offs,
p146
aVand that flow must be maintained always
p147
aVno matter what.
p148
aa(lp149
VOn the day after September 11 in 2001,
p150
aVI heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,
p151
aVand I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs
p152
aVand there was a man doing his paper recycling route
p153
aVlike he did every Wednesday.
p154
aVAnd I tried to thank him for doing his work
p155
aVon that day of all days,
p156
aVbut I started to cry.
p157
aVAnd he looked at me,
p158
aVand he just nodded, and he said,
p159
aV"We're going to be okay.
p160
aVWe're going to be okay."
p161
aVIt was a little while later that I started
p162
aVmy research with sanitation,
p163
aVand I met that man again.
p164
aVHis name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,
p165
aVand we became good friends.
p166
aa(lp167
VI want to believe that Paulie was right.
p168
aVWe are going to be okay.
p169
aVBut in our effort to reconfigure
p170
aVhow we as a species exist on this planet,
p171
aVwe must include and take account of
p172
aVall the costs, including the very real human cost
p173
aVof the labor.
p174
aVAnd we also would be well informed
p175
aVto reach out to the people who do that work
p176
aVand get their expertise
p177
aVon how do we think about,
p178
aVhow do we create systems around sustainability
p179
aVthat perhaps take us from curbside recycling,
p180
aVwhich is a remarkable success across 40 years,
p181
aVacross the United States and countries around the world,
p182
aVand lift us up to a broader horizon
p183
aVwhere we're looking at other forms of waste
p184
aVthat could be lessened
p185
aVfrom manufacturing and industrial sources.
p186
aVMunicipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,
p187
aVaccounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.
p188
aVIt's a remarkable statistic.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo in the flow of your days,
p191
aVin the flow of your lives,
p192
aVnext time you see someone whose job is
p193
aVto clean up after you,
p194
aVtake a moment to acknowledge them.
p195
aVTake a moment to say thank you.

anthropologist-in-residence at the Department of Sanitation in New York City since 2006.</p><p>Nagle&#39;s fascination with trash stems from her desire to understand the all-too-often invisible infrastructure that guides the flow of garbage through a megalopolis like New York. After all, the city produces 11,000 tons of rubbish each day... and all of that has to be dealt with somewhere and by someone. If not, damaging health problems and consequences for all. So why do sanitation workers experience such stigma, all too often scorned and berated while on the job? Nagle, who is also director of NYU&#39;s Draper Interdisciplinary Master&#39;s program in humanities and social thought, determined to find out. She got her sanitation worker license and has spent much time with workers on the job, getting an up-close view of the city&#39;s garbage and the systems in place to deal with it.&nbsp;</p><p> Her book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/pickingup\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Picking Up: On the Streets and Behind the Trucks with the Sanitation Workers of New York City</em></a>&nbsp;was published in 2013 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

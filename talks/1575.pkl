VHi. So, this chap here,
p5
aVhe thinks he can tell you the future.
p6
aVHis name is Nostradamus, although here the Sun have
p7
aVmade him look a little bit like Sean Connery. (Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd like most of you, I suspect, I don't really believe
p10
aVthat people can see into the future.
p11
aVI don't believe in precognition, and every now and then,
p12
aVyou hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future,
p13
aVand that's probably because it was a fluke, and we only
p14
aVhear about the flukes and about the freaks.
p15
aVWe don't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong.
p16
aVNow we expect that to happen with silly stories
p17
aVabout precognition, but the problem is,
p18
aVwe have exactly the same problem in academia
p19
aVand in medicine, and in this environment, it costs lives.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out,
p22
aVjust last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted
p23
aVa piece of research where he found evidence
p24
aVof precognitive powers in undergraduate students,
p25
aVand this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal
p26
aVand most of the people who read this just said, "Okay, well,
p27
aVfair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know
p28
aVthat if I did a study where I found no evidence
p29
aVthat undergraduate students had precognitive powers,
p30
aVit probably wouldn't get published in a journal.
p31
aVAnd in fact, we know that that's true, because
p32
aVseveral different groups of research scientists tried
p33
aVto replicate the findings of this precognition study,
p34
aVand when they submitted it to the exact same journal,
p35
aVthe journal said, "No, we're not interested in publishing
p36
aVreplication. We're not interested in your negative data."
p37
aVSo this is already evidence of how, in the academic
p38
aVliterature, we will see a biased sample of the true picture
p39
aVof all of the scientific studies that have been conducted.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut it doesn't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology.
p42
aVIt also happens in, for example, cancer research.
p43
aVSo in March, 2012, just one month ago, some researchers
p44
aVreported in the journal Nature how they had tried
p45
aVto replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at
p46
aVpotential treatment targets in cancer,
p47
aVand out of those 53 studies, they were only able
p48
aVto successfully replicate six.
p49
aVForty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable.
p50
aVAnd they say in their discussion that this is very likely
p51
aVbecause freaks get published.
p52
aVPeople will do lots and lots and lots of different studies,
p53
aVand the occasions when it works they will publish,
p54
aVand the ones where it doesn't work they won't.
p55
aVAnd their first recommendation of how to fix this problem,
p56
aVbecause it is a problem, because it sends us all down blind alleys,
p57
aVtheir first recommendation of how to fix this problem
p58
aVis to make it easier to publish negative results in science,
p59
aVand to change the incentives so that scientists are
p60
aVencouraged to post more of their negative results in public.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut it doesn't just happen in the very dry world
p63
aVof preclinical basic science cancer research.
p64
aVIt also happens in the very real, flesh and blood
p65
aVof academic medicine. So in 1980,
p66
aVsome researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide,
p67
aVand this was an anti-arrhythmic drug,
p68
aVa drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms,
p69
aVand the idea was, after people have had a heart attack,
p70
aVthey're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms,
p71
aVso if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart
p72
aVrhythms, this will increase the chances of them surviving.
p73
aVEarly on its development, they did a very small trial,
p74
aVjust under a hundred patients.
p75
aVFifty patients got lorcainide, and of those patients, 10 died.
p76
aVAnother 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill
p77
aVwith no active ingredient, and only one of them died.
p78
aVSo they rightly regarded this drug as a failure,
p79
aVand its commercial development was stopped, and because
p80
aVits commercial development was stopped, this trial was never published.
p81
aa(lp82
VUnfortunately, over the course of the next five, 10 years,
p83
aVother companies had the same idea about drugs that would
p84
aVprevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks.
p85
aVThese drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed
p86
aVvery widely because heart attacks are a very common thing,
p87
aVand it took so long for us to find out that these drugs
p88
aValso caused an increased rate of death
p89
aVthat before we detected that safety signal,
p90
aVover 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America
p91
aVfrom the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow actually, in 1993,
p94
aVthe researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study,
p95
aVpublished a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community,
p96
aVin which they said, "When we carried out our study in 1980,
p97
aVwe thought that the increased death rate that occurred
p98
aVin the lorcainide group was an effect of chance."
p99
aVThe development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons,
p100
aVand this study was never published;
p101
aVit's now a good example of publication bias.
p102
aVThat's the technical term for the phenomenon where
p103
aVunflattering data gets lost, gets unpublished, is left
p104
aVmissing in action, and they say the results described here
p105
aV"might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead."
p106
aa(lp107
VNow these are stories from basic science.
p108
aVThese are stories from 20, 30 years ago.
p109
aVThe academic publishing environment is very different now.
p110
aVThere are academic journals like "Trials," the open access journal,
p111
aVwhich will publish any trial conducted in humans
p112
aVregardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result.
p113
aVBut this problem of negative results that go missing in action
p114
aVis still very prevalent. In fact it's so prevalent
p115
aVthat it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine.
p116
aVSo this is a drug called reboxetine, and this is a drug
p117
aVthat I myself have prescribed. It's an antidepressant.
p118
aVAnd I'm a very nerdy doctor, so I read all of the studies
p119
aVthat I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published
p120
aVthat showed that reboxetine was better than placebo,
p121
aVand I read the other three studies that were published
p122
aVthat showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant,
p123
aVand because this patient hadn't done well on those other antidepressants,
p124
aVI thought, well, reboxetine is just as good. It's one to try.
p125
aVBut it turned out that I was misled. In fact,
p126
aVseven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine
p127
aVagainst a dummy placebo sugar pill. One of them
p128
aVwas positive and that was published, but six of them
p129
aVwere negative and they were left unpublished.
p130
aVThree trials were published comparing reboxetine
p131
aVagainst other antidepressants in which reboxetine
p132
aVwas just as good, and they were published,
p133
aVbut three times as many patients' worth of data was collected
p134
aVwhich showed that reboxetine was worse than
p135
aVthose other treatments, and those trials were not published.
p136
aVI felt misled.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow you might say, well, that's an extremely unusual example,
p139
aVand I wouldn't want to be guilty of the same kind of
p140
aVcherry-picking and selective referencing
p141
aVthat I'm accusing other people of.
p142
aVBut it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias
p143
aVhas actually been very, very well studied.
p144
aVSo here is one example of how you approach it.
p145
aVThe classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where
p146
aVyou know that they've been conducted and completed,
p147
aVand then you go and see if they've been published anywhere
p148
aVin the academic literature. So this took all of the trials
p149
aVthat had ever been conducted on antidepressants
p150
aVthat were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA.
p151
aVThey took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package.
p152
aVSo that's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs,
p153
aVbecause we can never know if we have those,
p154
aVbut it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization.
p155
aVAnd then they went to see if these trials had been published
p156
aVin the peer-reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found.
p157
aVIt was pretty much a 50-50 split. Half of these trials
p158
aVwere positive, half of them were negative, in reality.
p159
aVBut when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature,
p160
aVwhat they found was a very different picture.
p161
aVOnly three of the negative trials were published,
p162
aVbut all but one of the positive trials were published.
p163
aVNow if we just flick back and forth between those two,
p164
aVyou can see what a staggering difference there was
p165
aVbetween reality and what doctors, patients,
p166
aVcommissioners of health services, and academics
p167
aVwere able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature.
p168
aVWe were misled, and this is a systematic flaw
p169
aVin the core of medicine.
p170
aa(lp171
VIn fact, there have been so many studies conducted on
p172
aVpublication bias now, over a hundred, that they've been
p173
aVcollected in a systematic review, published in 2010,
p174
aVthat took every single study on publication bias
p175
aVthat they could find.
p176
aVPublication bias affects every field of medicine.
p177
aVAbout half of all trials, on average, go missing in action,
p178
aVand we know that positive findings are around twice as likely
p179
aVto be published as negative findings.
p180
aa(lp181
VThis is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine.
p182
aVIf I flipped a coin 100 times but then
p183
aVwithheld the results from you from half of those tosses,
p184
aVI could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads.
p185
aVBut that wouldn't mean that I had a two-headed coin.
p186
aVThat would mean that I was a chancer
p187
aVand you were an idiot for letting me get away with it. (Laughter)
p188
aVBut this is exactly what we blindly tolerate
p189
aVin the whole of evidence-based medicine.
p190
aVAnd to me, this is research misconduct.
p191
aVIf I conducted one study and I withheld
p192
aVhalf of the data points from that one study,
p193
aVyou would rightly accuse me, essentially, of research fraud.
p194
aVAnd yet, for some reason, if somebody conducts
p195
aV10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want,
p196
aVwe don't consider that to be research misconduct.
p197
aVAnd when that responsibility is diffused between
p198
aVa whole network of researchers, academics,
p199
aVindustry sponsors, journal editors, for some reason
p200
aVwe find it more acceptable,
p201
aVbut the effect on patients is damning.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd this is happening right now, today.
p204
aVThis is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug
p205
aVwhich governments around the world have spent billions
p206
aVand billions of dollars on stockpiling,
p207
aVand we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic,
p208
aVin the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza.
p209
aVComplications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia
p210
aVand death. (Laughter)
p211
aVNow when the Cochrane systematic reviewers
p212
aVwere trying to collect together all of the data from all
p213
aVof the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not,
p214
aVthey found that several of those trials were unpublished.
p215
aVThe results were unavailable to them.
p216
aVAnd when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means,
p217
aVthrough Freedom of Information Act requests, through
p218
aVharassing various different organizations, what they found was inconsistent.
p219
aVAnd when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports,
p220
aVthe 10,000-page long documents that have
p221
aVthe best possible rendition of the information,
p222
aVthey were told they weren't allowed to have them.
p223
aVAnd if you want to read the full correspondence
p224
aVand the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company,
p225
aVyou can see that written up in this week's edition
p226
aVof PLOS Medicine.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd the most staggering thing of all of this, to me,
p229
aVis that not only is this a problem, not only do we recognize
p230
aVthat this is a problem, but we've had to suffer fake fixes.
p231
aVWe've had people pretend that this is a problem that's been fixed.
p232
aVFirst of all, we had trials registers, and everybody said,
p233
aVoh, it's okay. We'll get everyone to register their trials, they'll post the protocol,
p234
aVthey'll say what they're going to do before they do it,
p235
aVand then afterwards we'll be able to check and see if all the trials which
p236
aVhave been conducted and completed have been published.
p237
aVBut people didn't bother to use those registers.
p238
aVAnd so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along,
p239
aVand they said, oh, well, we will hold the line.
p240
aVWe won't publish any journals, we won't publish any trials,
p241
aVunless they've been registered before they began.
p242
aVBut they didn't hold the line. In 2008, a study was conducted
p243
aVwhich showed that half of all of trials published by journals
p244
aVedited by members of the ICMJE
p245
aVweren't properly registered, and a quarter of them weren't registered at all.
p246
aVAnd then finally, the FDA Amendment Act was passed
p247
aVa couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts
p248
aVa trial must post the results of that trial within one year.
p249
aVAnd in the BMJ, in the first edition of January, 2012,
p250
aVyou can see a study which looks to see if people kept
p251
aVto that ruling, and it turns out that only one in five
p252
aVhave done so.
p253
aa(lp254
VThis is a disaster.
p255
aVWe cannot know the true effects of the medicines
p256
aVthat we prescribe if we do not have access
p257
aVto all of the information.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd this is not a difficult problem to fix.
p260
aVWe need to force people to publish all trials
p261
aVconducted in humans, including the older trials,
p262
aVbecause the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008,
p263
aVand I don't know what world it is in which we're only
p264
aVpracticing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years.
p265
aVWe need to publish all trials in humans,
p266
aVincluding the older trials, for all drugs in current use,
p267
aVand you need to tell everyone you know
p268
aVthat this is a problem and that it has not been fixed.
p269
aVThank you very much. (Applause)

What he reveals is a fascinating, terrifying mess. <br /><br />Goldacre was trained in medicine at Oxford and London, and works as an academic in epidemiology.

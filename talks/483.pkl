VSo, here we go: a flyby of play.
p5
aa(lp6
VIt's got to be serious if the New York Times
p7
aVputs a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play.
p8
aVAt the bottom of this, it says, "It's deeper than gender.
p9
aVSeriously, but dangerously fun.
p10
aVAnd a sandbox for new ideas about evolution."
p11
aVNot bad, except if you look at that cover, what's missing?
p12
aVYou see any adults?
p13
aa(lp14
VWell, lets go back to the 15th century.
p15
aVThis is a courtyard in Europe,
p16
aVand a mixture of 124 different kinds of play.
p17
aVAll ages, solo play, body play, games, taunting.
p18
aVAnd there it is. And I think this is a typical picture
p19
aVof what it was like in a courtyard then.
p20
aVI think we may have lost something in our culture.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I'm gonna take you through
p23
aVwhat I think is a remarkable sequence.
p24
aVNorth of Churchill, Manitoba, in October and November,
p25
aVthere's no ice on Hudson Bay.
p26
aVAnd this polar bear that you see, this 1200-pound male,
p27
aVhe's wild and fairly hungry.
p28
aVAnd Norbert Rosing, a German photographer,
p29
aVis there on scene, making a series of photos of these huskies, who are tethered.
p30
aVAnd from out of stage left comes this wild, male polar bear,
p31
aVwith a predatory gaze.
p32
aVAny of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you,
p33
aVthere is a fixed kind of predatory gaze
p34
aVthat you know you're in trouble.
p35
aVBut on the other side of that predatory gaze
p36
aVis a female husky in a play bow, wagging her tail.
p37
aVAnd something very unusual happens.
p38
aVThat fixed behavior \u2014 which is rigid and stereotyped
p39
aVand ends up with a meal \u2014 changes.
p40
aVAnd this polar bear
p41
aVstands over the husky,
p42
aVno claws extended, no fangs taking a look.
p43
aVAnd they begin an incredible ballet.
p44
aa(lp45
VA play ballet.
p46
aVThis is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature
p47
aVand what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death.
p48
aVAnd if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear,
p49
aVand look a little more closely, they're in an altered state.
p50
aVThey're in a state of play.
p51
aVAnd it's that state
p52
aVthat allows these two creatures to explore the possible.
p53
aVThey are beginning to do something that neither would have done
p54
aVwithout the play signals.
p55
aVAnd it is a marvelous example
p56
aVof how a differential in power
p57
aVcan be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow how did I get involved in this?
p60
aVJohn mentioned that I've done some work with murderers, and I have.
p61
aVThe Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes,
p62
aVin retrospect, when we studied his tragic mass murder,
p63
aVto the importance of play,
p64
aVin that that individual, by deep study,
p65
aVwas found to have severe play deprivation.
p66
aVCharles Whitman was his name.
p67
aVAnd our committee, which consisted of a lot of hard scientists,
p68
aVdid feel at the end of that study
p69
aVthat the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play
p70
aVled him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated.
p71
aVAnd that finding has stood the test of time \u2014
p72
aVunfortunately even into more recent times, at Virginia Tech.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd other studies of populations at risk
p75
aVsensitized me to the importance of play,
p76
aVbut I didn't really understand what it was.
p77
aVAnd it was many years in taking play histories of individuals
p78
aVbefore I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it.
p79
aVAnd I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it, by any means.
p80
aVBut there are ways of looking at it
p81
aVthat I think can give you \u2014 give us all a taxonomy, a way of thinking about it.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd this image is, for humans, the beginning point of play.
p84
aVWhen that mother and infant lock eyes,
p85
aVand the infant's old enough to have a social smile,
p86
aVwhat happens \u2014 spontaneously \u2014 is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother.
p87
aVAnd she begins to babble and coo and smile, and so does the baby.
p88
aVIf we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram,
p89
aVthe right brain of each of them becomes attuned,
p90
aVso that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes
p91
aVand the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play
p94
aVbuilds on this base for us humans.
p95
aVAnd so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play,
p96
aVbut it's never just singularly one thing.
p97
aa(lp98
VWe're going to look at body play,
p99
aVwhich is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity.
p100
aVThis is a mountain goat.
p101
aVIf you're having a bad day, try this:
p102
aVjump up and down, wiggle around \u2014 you're going to feel better.
p103
aVAnd you may feel like this character,
p104
aVwho is also just doing it for its own sake.
p105
aVIt doesn't have a particular purpose, and that's what's great about play.
p106
aVIf its purpose is more important
p107
aVthan the act of doing it, it's probably not play.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd there's a whole other type of play, which is object play.
p110
aVAnd this Japanese macaque has made a snowball,
p111
aVand he or she's going to roll down a hill.
p112
aVAnd \u2014 they don't throw it at each other, but this is a fundamental part of being playful.
p113
aVThe human hand, in manipulation of objects,
p114
aVis the hand in search of a brain;
p115
aVthe brain is in search of a hand;
p116
aVand play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way.
p117
aa(lp118
VJPL we heard this morning \u2014 JPL is an incredible place.
p119
aVThey have located two consultants,
p120
aVFrank Wilson and Nate Johnson,
p121
aVwho are \u2014 Frank Wilson is a neurologist, Nate Johnson is a mechanic.
p122
aVHe taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach,
p123
aVand found that his students were no longer able to solve problems.
p124
aVAnd he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion, quite on his own,
p125
aVthat the students who could no longer solve problems, such as fixing cars,
p126
aVhadn't worked with their hands.
p127
aVFrank Wilson had written a book called "The Hand."
p128
aVThey got together \u2014 JPL hired them.
p129
aVNow JPL, NASA and Boeing,
p130
aVbefore they will hire a research and development problem solver \u2014
p131
aVeven if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech \u2014
p132
aVif they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life,
p133
aVplayed with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well.
p134
aVSo play is practical, and it's very important.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration. (Laughter)
p137
aVBut it has to be safe exploration.
p138
aVThis happens to be OK \u2014 he's an anatomically interested little boy
p139
aVand that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good.
p140
aVBut curiosity, exploration, are part of the play scene.
p141
aVIf you want to belong, you need social play.
p142
aVAnd social play is part of what we're about here today,
p143
aVand is a byproduct of the play scene.
p144
aa(lp145
VRough and tumble play.
p146
aVThese lionesses, seen from a distance, looked like they were fighting.
p147
aVBut if you look closely, they're kind of like the polar bear and husky:
p148
aVno claws, flat fur, soft eyes,
p149
aVopen mouth with no fangs, balletic movements,
p150
aVcurvilinear movements \u2014 all specific to play.
p151
aVAnd rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us.
p152
aVPreschool kids, for example, should be allowed to dive, hit, whistle,
p153
aVscream, be chaotic, and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation
p154
aVand a lot of the other social byproducts \u2014 cognitive, emotional and physical \u2014
p155
aVthat come as a part of rough and tumble play.
p156
aa(lp157
VSpectator play, ritual play \u2014 we're involved in some of that.
p158
aVThose of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment \u2014 rare \u2014
p159
aVwhere the Red Sox won the World Series.
p160
aVBut take a look at the face and the body language of everybody
p161
aVin this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play.
p162
aa(lp163
VImaginative play.
p164
aVI love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture,
p165
aVbut it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination,
p166
aVher ability to spin yarns at this age \u2014 preschool.
p167
aVA really important part of being a player
p168
aVis imaginative solo play.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd I love this one, because it's also what we're about.
p171
aVWe all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story.
p172
aVThe unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story.
p173
aVI'm telling you a story today about play.
p174
aVWell, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long,
p175
aVbut it's a fundamental part of the play scene.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo what does play do for the brain?
p178
aVWell, a lot.
p179
aa(lp180
VWe don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain,
p181
aVbecause funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play.
p182
aVI walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant.
p183
aVThey'd given me a large grant when I was an academician
p184
aVfor the study of felony drunken drivers, and I thought I had a pretty good track record,
p185
aVand by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play,
p186
aVit was obvious that they were not \u2014 did not feel that play was serious.
p187
aVI think that \u2014 that's a few years back \u2014 I think that wave is past,
p188
aVand the play wave is cresting,
p189
aVbecause there is some good science.
p190
aa(lp191
VNothing lights up the brain like play.
p192
aVThree-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum,
p193
aVputs a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe \u2014
p194
aVthe executive portion \u2014 helps contextual memory be developed,
p195
aVand \u2014 and, and, and.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo it's \u2014 for me, its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure
p198
aVto look at the neuroscience that's associated with play, and to bring together people
p199
aVwho in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way.
p200
aVAnd that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about.
p201
aVAnd this is one of the ways you can study play \u2014
p202
aVis to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram.
p203
aVI'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility,
p204
aVwhich has limited the actual study of play.
p205
aVAnd we've got a mother-infant play scenario
p206
aVthat we're hoping to complete underway at the moment.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe reason I put this here is also to queue up
p209
aVmy thoughts about objectifying what play does.
p210
aVThe animal world has objectified it.
p211
aVIn the animal world, if you take rats,
p212
aVwho are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years
p213
aVand you suppress play \u2014 they squeak, they wrestle,
p214
aVthey pin each other, that's part of their play.
p215
aVIf you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with,
p216
aVand you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with,
p217
aVand then you present those rats
p218
aVwith a cat odor-saturated collar,
p219
aVthey're hardwired to flee and hide.
p220
aVPretty smart \u2014 they don't want to get killed by a cat.
p221
aVSo what happens?
p222
aVThey both hide out.
p223
aVThe non-players never come out \u2014
p224
aVthey die.
p225
aVThe players slowly explore the environment,
p226
aVand begin again to test things out.
p227
aVThat says to me, at least in rats \u2014
p228
aVand I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do
p229
aVand a similar cortical architecture \u2014
p230
aVthat play may be pretty important for our survival.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd, and, and \u2014 there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow, this is a consequence of play deprivation. (Laughter)
p235
aVThis took a long time \u2014
p236
aVI had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT
p237
aVand multiple EEGs, but as a couch potato, his brain has shrunk.
p238
aVAnd we do know that in domestic animals
p239
aVand others, when they're play deprived,
p240
aVthey don't \u2014 and rats also \u2014 they don't develop a brain that is normal.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow, the program says that the opposite of play is not work,
p243
aVit's depression.
p244
aVAnd I think if you think about life without play \u2014
p245
aVno humor, no flirtation, no movies,
p246
aVno games, no fantasy and, and, and.
p247
aVTry and imagine a culture or a life, adult or otherwise
p248
aVwithout play.
p249
aVAnd the thing that's so unique about our species
p250
aVis that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd we all have capacity to play signal.
p253
aVNobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago.
p254
aVWhat's going to follow from that behavior
p255
aVis play.
p256
aVAnd you can trust it.
p257
aVThe basis of human trust is established through play signals.
p258
aVAnd we begin to lose those signals, culturally and otherwise, as adults.
p259
aVThat's a shame.
p260
aVI think we've got a lot of learning to do.
p261
aa(lp262
VNow, Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps.
p263
aVSo part of the signaling system of play
p264
aVhas to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural.
p265
aVYou know, you can tell \u2014 and I think when we're getting into collective play,
p266
aVits really important for groups to gain a sense of safety
p267
aVthrough their own sharing of play signals.
p268
aa(lp269
VYou may not know this word,
p270
aVbut it should be your biological first name and last name.
p271
aVBecause neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood.
p272
aVAnd we are, by physical anthropologists,
p273
aVby many, many studies, the most neotenous,
p274
aVthe most youthful, the most flexible, the most plastic of all creatures.
p275
aVAnd therefore, the most playful.
p276
aVAnd this gives us a leg up on adaptability.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow, there is a way of looking at play
p279
aVthat I also want to emphasize here,
p280
aVwhich is the play history.
p281
aVYour own personal play history is unique,
p282
aVand often is not something we think about particularly.
p283
aa(lp284
VThis is a book written by a consummate player
p285
aVby the name of Kevin Carroll.
p286
aVKevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances:
p287
aValcoholic mother, absent father, inner-city Philadelphia,
p288
aVblack, had to take care of a younger brother.
p289
aVFound that when he looked at a playground
p290
aVout of a window into which he had been confined,
p291
aVhe felt something different.
p292
aVAnd so he followed up on it.
p293
aVAnd his life \u2014 the transformation of his life
p294
aVfrom deprivation and what one would expect \u2014 potentially prison or death \u2014
p295
aVhe become a linguist, a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker.
p296
aVAnd he gives play as a transformative force
p297
aVover his entire life.
p298
aa(lp299
VNow there's another play history that I think is a work in progress.
p300
aVThose of you who remember Al Gore,
p301
aVduring the first term and then during his successful
p302
aVbut unelected run for the presidency,
p303
aVmay remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person,
p304
aVat least in public.
p305
aVAnd looking at his history, which is common in the press,
p306
aVit seems to me, at least \u2014 looking at it from a shrink's point of view \u2014
p307
aVthat a lot of his life was programmed.
p308
aVSummers were hard, hard work, in the heat of Tennessee summers.
p309
aVHe had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C.
p310
aVAnd although I think he certainly had the capacity for play \u2014
p311
aVbecause I do know something about that \u2014
p312
aVhe wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now is
p313
aVby paying attention to what is his own passion
p314
aVand his own inner drive,
p315
aVwhich I think has its basis in all of us in our play history.
p316
aa(lp317
VSo what I would encourage on an individual level to do,
p318
aVis to explore backwards as far as you can go
p319
aVto the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have,
p320
aVwhether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation.
p321
aVAnd begin to build to build from the emotion of that
p322
aVinto how that connects with your life now.
p323
aVAnd you'll find, you may change jobs \u2014
p324
aVwhich has happened to a number people when I've had them do this \u2014
p325
aVin order to be more empowered through their play.
p326
aVOr you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it
p327
aVand paying attention to it.
p328
aa(lp329
VMost of us work with groups, and I put this up because
p330
aVthe d.school, the design school at Stanford,
p331
aVthanks to David Kelley and a lot of others
p332
aVwho have been visionary about its establishment,
p333
aVhas allowed a group of us to get together
p334
aVand create a course called "From Play to Innovation."
p335
aVAnd you'll see this course is to investigate
p336
aVthe human state of play, which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state
p337
aVand its importance to creative thinking:
p338
aV"to explore play behavior, its development and its biological basis;
p339
aVto apply those principles, through design thinking,
p340
aVto promote innovation in the corporate world;
p341
aVand the students will work with real-world partners
p342
aVon design projects with widespread application."
p343
aa(lp344
VThis is our maiden voyage in this.
p345
aVWe're about two and a half, three months into it, and it's really been fun.
p346
aVThere is our star pupil, this labrador,
p347
aVwho taught a lot of us what a state of play is,
p348
aVand an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there.
p349
aVAnd Brendan Boyle, Rich Crandall \u2014 and on the far right is, I think, a person who
p350
aVwill be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize \u2014 Stuart Thompson,
p351
aVin neuroscience.
p352
aVSo we've had Brendan, who's from IDEO,
p353
aVand the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students
p354
aVas they put play principles into practice in the classroom.
p355
aVAnd one of their projects was to
p356
aVsee what makes meetings boring,
p357
aVand to try and do something about it.
p358
aVSo what will follow is a student-made film
p359
aVabout just that.
p360
aa(lp361
VNarrator: Flow is the mental state of apparition
p362
aVin which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing.
p363
aVCharacterized by a feeling of energized focus,
p364
aVfull involvement and success in the process of the activity.
p365
aa(lp366
VAn important key insight that we learned about meetings
p367
aVis that people pack them in one after another,
p368
aVdisruptive to the day.
p369
aVAttendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task
p370
aVthat they left at their desk.
p371
aVBut it doesn't have to be that way.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Music)
p374
aa(lp375
VSome sage and repeatedly furry monks
p376
aVat this place called the d.school
p377
aVdesigned a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over.
p378
aVTake the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me.
p379
aVBecause when you need it again,
p380
aVthe meeting is literally hanging in your closet.
p381
aa(lp382
VThe Wearable Meeting.
p383
aVBecause when you put it on, you immediately get everything you need
p384
aVto have a fun and productive and useful meeting.
p385
aVBut when you take it off \u2014
p386
aVthat's when the real action happens.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Music)
p389
aa(lp390
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p391
aa(lp392
VStuart Brown: So I would encourage you all
p393
aVto engage
p394
aVnot in the work-play differential \u2014
p395
aVwhere you set aside time to play \u2014
p396
aVbut where your life becomes infused
p397
aVminute by minute, hour by hour,
p398
aVwith body,
p399
aVobject,
p400
aVsocial, fantasy, transformational kinds of play.
p401
aVAnd I think you'll have a better and more empowered life.
p402
aVThank You.
p403
aa(lp404
V(Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VJohn Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that
p407
aVthere may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work
p408
aVand go \u2014
p409
aVI think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play,
p410
aVthat somehow,
p411
aVthe way animals and humans deal with play,
p412
aVis that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity.
p413
aVYour work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong.

aa(lp415
VSB: Yeah, I don't think that's accurate,
p416
aVand I think probably because animals have taught us that.
p417
aVIf you stop a cat from playing \u2014
p418
aVwhich you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff \u2014
p419
aVthey're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played.
p420
aVAnd if you imagine a kid
p421
aVpretending to be King Kong,
p422
aVor a race car driver, or a fireman,
p423
aVthey don't all become race car drivers or firemen, you know.
p424
aVSo there's a disconnect between preparation for the future \u2014
p425
aVwhich is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as \u2014
p426
aVand thinking of it as a separate biological entity.
p427
aa(lp428
VAnd this is where my chasing animals for four, five years
p429
aVreally changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now,
p430
aVwhich is that play has a biological place,
p431
aVjust like sleep and dreams do.
p432
aVAnd if you look at sleep and dreams biologically,
p433
aVanimals sleep and dream,
p434
aVand they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory
p435
aVand that are a very important part of sleep and dreams.
p436
aa(lp437
VThe next step of evolution in mammals and
p438
aVcreatures with divinely superfluous neurons
p439
aVwill be to play.
p440
aVAnd the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear
p441
aVor you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience
p442
aVsets play aside as something separate.
p443
aVAnd its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain.
p444
aVSo it's not just something you do in your spare time.
p445
aa(lp446
VJH: How do you keep \u2014 and I know you're part of the scientific research community,
p447
aVand you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else \u2014
p448
aVhow do you prevent \u2014
p449
aVand some of the data that you've produced, the good science that you're talking about you've produced, is hot to handle.
p450
aVHow do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work
p451
aVor the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work,
p452
aVkind of like the Mozart metaphor,
p453
aVwhere, "Oh, MRIs show
p454
aVthat play enhances your intelligence.
p455
aVWell, let's round these kids up, put them in pens
p456
aVand make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard."
p457
aVHow do you prevent people from taking that sort of action
p458
aVon the data that you're developing?
p459
aa(lp460
VSB: Well, I think the only way I know to do it
p461
aVis to have accumulated the advisers that I have
p462
aVwho go from practitioners \u2014
p463
aVwho can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever \u2014
p464
aVa state of play.
p465
aVSo people know that it's there.
p466
aVAnd then you get an fMRI specialist, and you get Frank Wilson,
p467
aVand you get other kinds of hard scientists, including neuroendocrinologists.
p468
aVAnd you get them into a group together focused on play,
p469
aVand it's pretty hard not to take it seriously.
p470
aa(lp471
VUnfortunately, that hasn't been done sufficiently
p472
aVfor the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health
p473
aVor anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously.
p474
aVI mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease
p475
aVassociated with play.
p476
aVAnd yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival \u2014 long term \u2014
p477
aVas learning some of the basic things about public health.
p478
aa(lp479
VJH: Stuart Brown, thank you very much.

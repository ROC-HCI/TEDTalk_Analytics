VMy name's Seth Priebatsch. I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR.
p5
aVI'm a proud Princeton dropout.
p6
aVAlso proud to have relocated here to Boston,
p7
aVwhere I actually grew up.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Applause) Yeah, Boston.
p10
aa(lp11
VEasy wins, I should just name the counties that we've got around here.
p12
aVI'm also fairly determined to try and build
p13
aVa game layer on top of the world.
p14
aVThis is sort of a new concept and it's really important,
p15
aVbecause while the last decade was the decade of social,
p16
aVthe decade where the framework in which we connect with other people was built,
p17
aVthis next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built,
p18
aVwhere the motivations we use to actually influence behavior
p19
aVand the framework in which that is constructed,
p20
aVis decided upon, and that's really important.
p21
aa(lp22
VI say I want to build a game layer on top of the world,
p23
aVbut that's not quite true,
p24
aVbecause it's already under construction; it's already happening.
p25
aVAnd it looks like this right now.
p26
aVIt looks like the Web did back in 1997, right?
p27
aVIt's not very good. It's cluttered.
p28
aVIt's filled with lots of different things that, in short, aren't that fun.
p29
aVThere are credit card schemes and airline mile programs,
p30
aVcoupon cards and all these loyalty schemes
p31
aVthat actually do use game dynamics and are building the game layer \u2014
p32
aVthey just suck.
p33
aVThey're not very well-designed.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VSo that's unfortunate.
p38
aVBut luckily, as my favorite action hero, Bob the Builder, says,
p39
aV"We can do better. We can build this better."
p40
aVAnd the tools, the resources that we use to build a game layer,
p41
aVare game dynamics themselves.
p42
aVAnd so the crux of this presentation is going to go through
p43
aVfour really important game dynamics,
p44
aVreally interesting things, that, if you use consciously,
p45
aVyou can use to influence behavior,
p46
aVboth for good, for bad, for in-between.
p47
aVHopefully for good.
p48
aVBut this is the important stage in which that framework will get built,
p49
aVand so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now.
p50
aa(lp51
VBefore we jump into that, there's a question of:
p52
aVWhy is this important?
p53
aVI'm making this claim
p54
aVthat there's a game layer on top of the world,
p55
aVand it's very important that we build it properly.
p56
aVThe reason it's so important is that, in the last decade,
p57
aVwhat we've seen has been building the social layer,
p58
aVhas been this framework for connections,
p59
aVand construction on that layer is over, it's finished.
p60
aVThere's still a lot to explore,
p61
aVstill a lot of people trying to figure out social
p62
aVand how we leverage this and how we use this,
p63
aVbut the framework itself is done,
p64
aVand it's called Facebook.
p65
aVAnd that's OK, right? A lot of people are very happy with Facebook.
p66
aVI like it quite a lot.
p67
aVThey've created this thing called the Open Graph,
p68
aVand they own all of our connections.
p69
aVThey own half a billion people.
p70
aVSo when you want to build on the social layer,
p71
aVthe framework has been decided; it is the Open Graph API.
p72
aVAnd if you're happy with that, fantastic.
p73
aVIf you're not, too bad. There's nothing you can do.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd that's a real thing.
p76
aVI mean, we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable
p77
aVand makes it productive down the road.
p78
aVSo, the social layer is all about these connections.
p79
aVThe game layer is all about influence.
p80
aVIt's not about adding a social fabric to the web
p81
aVand connecting you to other people
p82
aVeverywhere you are and everywhere you go,
p83
aVit's actually about using dynamics, using forces,
p84
aVto influence the behavior of where you are, what you do there,
p85
aVhow you do it.
p86
aVThat's really, really powerful.
p87
aVAnd it's going to be more important than the social layer,
p88
aVand affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly.
p89
aVSo it's incredibly critical that at this moment,
p90
aVwhile it's just getting constructed,
p91
aVwhile the frameworks like Facebook or Open Graph
p92
aVare being created for the game-layer equivalent,
p93
aVthat we think about it very consciously,
p94
aVand that we do it in a way that is open, available,
p95
aVand can be leveraged for good.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo that's what I want to talk about for game dynamics,
p98
aVbecause construction has just begun,
p99
aVand the more consciously we can think about this,
p100
aVthe better we'll be able to use it for anything we want.
p101
aVSo like I said, the way you go through and build on the game layer
p102
aVis not with glass and steel and cement.
p103
aVAnd the resources we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land
p104
aVthat we have.
p105
aVThe resources are mindshare,
p106
aVand the tools, the raw materials, are these game dynamics.
p107
aVWith that, a couple game dynamics to talk about.
p108
aVBack at SCVNGR, we like to joke
p109
aVthat with seven game dynamics, you can get anyone to do anything.
p110
aVToday, I'm going to show you four,
p111
aVbecause I hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this, still.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VSo the first one, it's a very simple game dynamic.
p116
aVIt's called the appointment dynamic.
p117
aVIt's a dynamic in which to succeed,
p118
aVplayers have to do something at a predefined time,
p119
aVgenerally at a predefined place.
p120
aVAnd these dynamics are a little scary sometimes,
p121
aVbecause you think, "Other people can be using forces
p122
aVthat will manipulate how I interact:
p123
aVwhat I do, where I do it, when I do it."
p124
aVThis sort of "loss of free will" that occurs in games
p125
aVcan be frightening.
p126
aVSo with each dynamic, I'm going to give three examples:
p127
aVone that shows how it's already being used in the real world,
p128
aVso you can rationalize it a bit;
p129
aVone that shows it in what we consider a conventional game \u2014
p130
aVI think everything is a game,
p131
aVbut this is more what you'd think of as a game played on a board
p132
aVor on a computer screen;
p133
aVand one of how it can be used for good,
p134
aVso you can see that these forces can be very powerful.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo the first one, the most famous appointment dynamic in the world,
p137
aVis something called, "Happy Hour."
p138
aVSo I had just recently dropped out of Princeton
p139
aVand actually ended up for the first time in a bar,
p140
aVand I saw these happy hour things all over the place.
p141
aVAnd this is simply an appointment dynamic: come here at a certain time,
p142
aVget your drinks half off.
p143
aVTo win, all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time.
p144
aVThis game dynamic is so powerful,
p145
aVit doesn't just influence our behavior; it's influenced our entire culture.
p146
aVThat's a really scary thought,
p147
aVthat one game dynamic can change things so powerfully.
p148
aa(lp149
VIt also exists in more conventional game forms.
p150
aVI'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now.
p151
aVIf you haven't, I recommend playing it.
p152
aVYou won't do anything else for the rest of your day.
p153
aVFarmville has more active users than Twitter.
p154
aVIt's incredibly powerful,
p155
aVand it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time
p156
aVto water your fake crops, or they wilt.
p157
aVAnd this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats,
p158
aVwhen they say your crops wilt
p159
aVafter eight hours, or after six hours, or after 24 hours,
p160
aVit changes the life cycle of some 70 million people during the day.
p161
aVThey will return, like clockwork, at different times.
p162
aVSo if they wanted the world to end, if they wanted productivity to stop,
p163
aVthey could make it a 30-minute cycle,
p164
aVand no one could do anything else, right?
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VThat's a little scary.
p169
aVBut this could also be used for good.
p170
aVThis local company called Vitality
p171
aVhas created a product to help people take their medicine on time.
p172
aVThat's an appointment.
p173
aVIt's something that people don't do very well.
p174
aVThey have these GlowCaps which flash and email you
p175
aVand do cool things to remind you to take your medicine.
p176
aVThis isn't a game yet, but really should be.
p177
aVYou should get points for doing it on time
p178
aVand lose points for not doing it on time.
p179
aVThey should recognize they've built an appointment dynamic,
p180
aVand leverage the games.
p181
aVThen you can really achieve good in some interesting ways.
p182
aa(lp183
VWe're going to jump onto the next one.
p184
aVInfluence and status.
p185
aVThis is one of the most famous game dynamics, used all over the place.
p186
aVIt's used in your wallets, right now.
p187
aVWe all want that credit card on the far left, because it's black.
p188
aVAnd you see someone at CVS or \u2014
p189
aVnot CVS \u2014 like, Christian Dior \u2014
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VI don't know. I don't have a black card; I've got a debit card.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VSo they whip it out and you see that black card, and:
p198
aV"I want that because it means they're cooler than I am,
p199
aVand I need that."
p200
aVAnd this is used in games as well.
p201
aV"Modern Warfare," one of the most successful selling games of all time.
p202
aVI'm only a level four, but I desperately want to be a level 10,
p203
aVbecause they've got that cool red badge,
p204
aVand that means that I am somehow better than everyone else.
p205
aVAnd that's very powerful to me.
p206
aVStatus is really good motivator.
p207
aa(lp208
VIt's also used in more conventional settings,
p209
aVand can be used more consciously there.
p210
aVSchool \u2014 and remember, I made it through one year,
p211
aVso I think I'm qualified to talk on school \u2014
p212
aVis a game; it's just not a terribly well-designed game.
p213
aVThere are levels. There are C. There are B. There's A.
p214
aVThere are statuses. I mean, what is valedictorian, but a status?
p215
aVIf we called valedictorian a "White Knight Paladin level 20,"
p216
aVI think people would probably work a lot harder.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
V(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VSo school is a game,
p223
aVand there has been lots of experimentation on how we do this properly.
p224
aVBut let's use it consciously.
p225
aVWhy have games you can lose? Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C?
p226
aVThat sucks. Why not level-up?
p227
aVAt Princeton, they've actually experimented with this,
p228
aVwith quizzes where you gain experience points,
p229
aVand you level up from B to an A.
p230
aVAnd it's very powerful.
p231
aVIt can be used in interesting ways.
p232
aa(lp233
VThe third one I'll talk about is the progression dynamic,
p234
aVwhere you have to make progress, move through different steps
p235
aVin a very granular fashion.
p236
aVThis is used all over the place, including LinkedIn,
p237
aVwhere I am an unwhole individual.
p238
aVI am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,
p239
aVand that bothers me.
p240
aVAnd this is so deep-seated in our psyche
p241
aVthat when we're presented with a progress bar
p242
aVand presented with easy, granular steps to take
p243
aVto try and complete that progress bar, we will do it.
p244
aVWe will find a way to move that blue line
p245
aVall the way to the right edge of the screen.
p246
aa(lp247
VThis is used in conventional games as well.
p248
aVI mean, this is a Paladin level 10,
p249
aVand that's a Paladin level 20.
p250
aVAnd if you were going to fight Orcs on the fields of Mordor
p251
aVagainst the Ra's Al Ghul,
p252
aVyou'd probably want to be the bigger one, right?
p253
aVI would.
p254
aVAnd so people work very hard to level-up.
p255
aV"World of Warcraft" is one of the most successful games of all time.
p256
aVThe average player spends some six, six-and-a-half hours a day on it,
p257
aVtheir most dedicated players \u2014 it's like a full-time job, it's insane.
p258
aVAnd they have these systems where you can level-up.
p259
aVAnd that's a very powerful thing. Progression is powerful.
p260
aa(lp261
VIt can also be used in very compelling ways for good.
p262
aVOne of the things we work on at SCVNGR is:
p263
aVHow do you use games to drive traffic and business to local businesses,
p264
aVto something that is very key to the economy?
p265
aVAnd here, we have a game that people play.
p266
aVThey go places, do challenges, earn points.
p267
aVAnd we've introduced a progression dynamic into it,
p268
aVwhere, by going to the same place over and over, doing challenges,
p269
aVengaging with the business,
p270
aVyou move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right,
p271
aVand unlock rewards.
p272
aVThis is powerful enough that we can see it hooks people into these dynamics,
p273
aVpulls them back to the same local businesses,
p274
aVcreates loyalty, creates engagement,
p275
aVand is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses.
p276
aVThese progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world.
p277
aa(lp278
VThe final one I want to talk about \u2014 and it's a great one to end on \u2014
p279
aVis this concept of communal discovery,
p280
aVa dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something.
p281
aVCommunal discovery is powerful
p282
aVbecause it leverages the network that is society
p283
aVto solve problems.
p284
aVThis is used in some famous consumer web stories like Digg,
p285
aVwhich I'm sure you've all heard of.
p286
aVDigg is a communal dynamic
p287
aVto try to find and source the best news, the most interesting stories.
p288
aVAnd they made this into a game, initially.
p289
aVThey had a leader board where, if you recommended the best stories,
p290
aVyou would get points.
p291
aVAnd that really motivated people to find the best stories.
p292
aVBut it became so powerful, there was actually a cabal,
p293
aVa group of people, the top seven on the leader board,
p294
aVwho would work together to make sure they maintained that position,
p295
aVrecommending people's stories.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe game became more powerful than the goal.
p298
aVThey ended up shutting down the leader board because, while it was effective,
p299
aVit was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories,
p300
aVand started having people work to maintain leadership.
p301
aVSo we have to use this one carefully.
p302
aVIt's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly,
p303
aVwhere the game is not the Monopoly you're playing,
p304
aVbut the cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk.
p305
aVThere, they're just looking for a sticker that says "Boardwalk,"
p306
aVbut it can also be used to find real things.
p307
aVThis is the DARPA balloon challenge,
p308
aVwhere they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said,
p309
aV"Use networks. Try and find these balloons fastest,
p310
aVand the winner will get $40,000."
p311
aVThe winner was a group out of MIT,
p312
aVwhere they created sort of a pyramid scheme, a network,
p313
aVwhere the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000,
p314
aVand anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut.
p315
aVAnd in 12 hours, they were able to find all these balloons,
p316
aVall across the country.
p317
aVReally powerful dynamic.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd so, I've got about 20 seconds left,
p320
aVso if I'm going to leave you with anything,
p321
aVlast decade was the decade of social.
p322
aVThis next decade is the decade of games.
p323
aVWe use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare.
p324
aVWe can influence behavior.
p325
aVIt's very powerful. It's very exciting.
p326
aVLet's all build it together, let's do it well and have fun playing.

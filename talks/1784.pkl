VWhen we talk about corruption,
p5
aVthere are typical types of individuals that spring to mind.
p6
aVThere's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.
p7
aVSaparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.
p8
aVUntil his death in 2006,
p9
aVhe was the all-powerful leader of Turkmenistan,
p10
aVa Central Asian country rich in natural gas.
p11
aVNow, he really loved to issue presidential decrees.
p12
aVAnd one renamed the months of the year
p13
aVincluding after himself and his mother.
p14
aVHe spent millions of dollars
p15
aVcreating a bizarre personality cult,
p16
aVand his crowning glory was the building
p17
aVof a 40-foot-high gold-plated statue of himself
p18
aVwhich stood proudly in the capital's central square
p19
aVand rotated to follow the sun.
p20
aVHe was a slightly unusual guy.
p21
aVAnd then there's that cliché,
p22
aVthe African dictator or minister or official.
p23
aVThere's Teodorín Obiang.
p24
aVSo his daddy is president for life of Equatorial Guinea,
p25
aVa West African nation that has exported
p26
aVbillions of dollars of oil since the 1990s
p27
aVand yet has a truly appalling human rights record.
p28
aVThe vast majority of its people
p29
aVare living in really miserable poverty
p30
aVdespite an income per capita that's on a par
p31
aVwith that of Portugal.
p32
aVSo Obiang junior, well, he buys himself
p33
aVa $30 million mansion in Malibu, California.
p34
aVI've been up to its front gates.
p35
aVI can tell you it's a magnificent spread.
p36
aVHe bought an \u20ac18 million art collection
p37
aVthat used to belong to fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent,
p38
aVa stack of fabulous sports cars,
p39
aVsome costing a million dollars apiece \u2014
p40
aVoh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.
p41
aVNow get this:
p42
aVUntil recently, he was earning an official monthly salary
p43
aVof less than 7,000 dollars.
p44
aVAnd there's Dan Etete.
p45
aVWell, he was the former oil minister of Nigeria
p46
aVunder President Abacha,
p47
aVand it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too.
p48
aVWe've spent a great deal of time
p49
aVinvestigating a $1 billion \u2014
p50
aVthat's right, a $1 billion \u2014
p51
aVoil deal that he was involved with,
p52
aVand what we found was pretty shocking,
p53
aVbut more about that later.
p54
aVSo it's easy to think that corruption happens
p55
aVsomewhere over there,
p56
aVcarried out by a bunch of greedy despots
p57
aVand individuals up to no good in countries
p58
aVthat we, personally, may know very little about
p59
aVand feel really unconnected to
p60
aVand unaffected by what might be going on.
p61
aVBut does it just happen over there?
p62
aVWell, at 22, I was very lucky.
p63
aVMy first job out of university
p64
aVwas investigating the illegal trade in African ivory.
p65
aVAnd that's how my relationship with corruption really began.
p66
aVIn 1993, with two friends who were colleagues,
p67
aVSimon Taylor and Patrick Alley,
p68
aVwe set up an organization called Global Witness.
p69
aVOur first campaign was investigating the role
p70
aVof illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia.
p71
aVSo a few years later, and it's now 1997,
p72
aVand I'm in Angola undercover investigating blood diamonds.
p73
aVPerhaps you saw the film,
p74
aVthe Hollywood film "Blood Diamond,"
p75
aVthe one with Leonardo DiCaprio.
p76
aVWell, some of that sprang from our work.
p77
aVLuanda, it was full of land mine victims
p78
aVwho were struggling to survive on the streets
p79
aVand war orphans living in sewers under the streets,
p80
aVand a tiny, very wealthy elite
p81
aVwho gossiped about shopping trips to Brazil and Portugal.
p82
aVAnd it was a slightly crazy place.
p83
aVSo I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room
p84
aVfeeling just totally overwhelmed.
p85
aVBut it wasn't about blood diamonds.
p86
aVBecause I'd been speaking to lots of people there
p87
aVwho, well, they talked about a different problem:
p88
aVthat of a massive web of corruption on a global scale
p89
aVand millions of oil dollars going missing.
p90
aVAnd for what was then a very small organization
p91
aVof just a few people,
p92
aVtrying to even begin to think how we might tackle that
p93
aVwas an enormous challenge.
p94
aVAnd in the years that I've been,
p95
aVand we've all been campaigning and investigating,
p96
aVI've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption
p97
aVon a global, massive scale possible,
p98
aVwell it isn't just greed or the misuse of power
p99
aVor that nebulous phrase "weak governance."
p100
aVI mean, yes, it's all of those,
p101
aVbut corruption, it's made possible by the actions
p102
aVof global facilitators.
p103
aVSo let's go back to some of those people I talked about earlier.
p104
aVNow, they're all people we've investigated,
p105
aVand they're all people who couldn't do what they do alone.
p106
aVTake Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up
p107
aVwith high-end art and luxury houses without help.
p108
aVHe did business with global banks.
p109
aVA bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him,
p110
aVone of which was used to buy the art,
p111
aVand American banks, well, they funneled
p112
aV73 million dollars into the States,
p113
aVsome of which was used to buy that California mansion.
p114
aVAnd he didn't do all of this in his own name either.
p115
aVHe used shell companies.
p116
aVHe used one to buy the property, and another,
p117
aVwhich was in somebody else's name,
p118
aVto pay the huge bills it cost to run the place.
p119
aVAnd then there's Dan Etete.
p120
aVWell, when he was oil minister,
p121
aVhe awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars
p122
aVto a company that, guess what, yeah,
p123
aVhe was the hidden owner of.
p124
aVNow, it was then much later traded on
p125
aVwith the kind assistance of the Nigerian government \u2014
p126
aVnow I have to be careful what I say here \u2014
p127
aVto subsidiaries of Shell and the Italian Eni,
p128
aVtwo of the biggest oil companies around.
p129
aVSo the reality is, is that the engine of corruption,
p130
aVwell, it exists far beyond the shores of countries
p131
aVlike Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.
p132
aVThis engine, well, it's driven
p133
aVby our international banking system,
p134
aVby the problem of anonymous shell companies,
p135
aVand by the secrecy that we have afforded
p136
aVbig oil, gas and mining operations,
p137
aVand, most of all, by the failure of our politicians
p138
aVto back up their rhetoric and do something
p139
aVreally meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff.
p140
aVNow let's take the banks first.
p141
aVWell, it's not going to come as any surprise
p142
aVfor me to tell you that banks accept dirty money,
p143
aVbut they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too.
p144
aVFor example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.
p145
aVNow this region, it has just five percent
p146
aVof its forests left intact. Five percent.
p147
aVSo how did that happen?
p148
aVWell, because an elite and its facilitators
p149
aVhave been making millions of dollars
p150
aVfrom supporting logging on an industrial scale
p151
aVfor many years.
p152
aVSo we sent an undercover investigator in
p153
aVto secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite,
p154
aVand the resulting footage, well, it made some people very angry,
p155
aVand you can see that on YouTube,
p156
aVbut it proved what we had long suspected,
p157
aVbecause it showed how the state's chief minister,
p158
aVdespite his later denials,
p159
aVused his control over land and forest licenses
p160
aVto enrich himself and his family.
p161
aVAnd HSBC, well, we know that HSBC bankrolled
p162
aVthe region's largest logging companies
p163
aVthat were responsible for some of that destruction
p164
aVin Sarawak and elsewhere.
p165
aVThe bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process,
p166
aVbut it earned around 130 million dollars.
p167
aVNow shortly after our exposé,
p168
aVvery shortly after our exposé earlier this year,
p169
aVthe bank announced a policy review on this.
p170
aVAnd is this progress? Maybe,
p171
aVbut we're going to be keeping a very close eye
p172
aVon that case.
p173
aVAnd then there's the problem of anonymous shell companies.
p174
aVWell, we've all heard about what they are, I think,
p175
aVand we all know they're used quite a bit
p176
aVby people and companies who are trying to avoid
p177
aVpaying their proper dues to society,
p178
aValso known as taxes.
p179
aVBut what doesn't usually come to light
p180
aVis how shell companies are used to steal
p181
aVhuge sums of money, transformational sums of money,
p182
aVfrom poor countries.
p183
aVIn virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated,
p184
aVshell companies have appeared,
p185
aVand sometimes it's been impossible to find out
p186
aVwho is really involved in the deal.
p187
aVA recent study by the World Bank
p188
aVlooked at 200 cases of corruption.
p189
aVIt found that over 70 percent of those cases
p190
aVhad used anonymous shell companies,
p191
aVtotaling almost 56 billion dollars.
p192
aVNow many of these companies were in America
p193
aVor the United Kingdom,
p194
aVits overseas territories and Crown dependencies,
p195
aVand so it's not just an offshore problem,
p196
aVit's an on-shore one too.
p197
aVYou see, shell companies, they're central
p198
aVto the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites
p199
aVrather than ordinary citizens.
p200
aVOne striking recent case that we've investigated
p201
aVis how the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo
p202
aVsold off a series of valuable, state-owned mining assets
p203
aVto shell companies in the British Virgin Islands.
p204
aVSo we spoke to sources in country,
p205
aVtrawled through company documents and other information
p206
aVtrying to piece together a really true picture of the deal.
p207
aVAnd we were alarmed to find that these shell companies
p208
aVhad quickly flipped many of the assets on
p209
aVfor huge profits to major international mining companies
p210
aVlisted in London.
p211
aVNow, the Africa Progress Panel, led by Kofi Annan,
p212
aVthey've calculated that Congo may have lost
p213
aVmore than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals.
p214
aVThat's almost twice
p215
aVthe country's annual health and education budget combined.
p216
aVAnd will the people of Congo, will they ever get their money back?
p217
aVWell, the answer to that question,
p218
aVand who was really involved and what really happened,
p219
aVwell that's going to probably remain locked away
p220
aVin the secretive company registries of the British Virgin Islands
p221
aVand elsewhere unless we all do something about it.
p222
aVAnd how about the oil, gas and mining companies?
p223
aVOkay, maybe it's a bit of a cliché to talk about them.
p224
aVCorruption in that sector, no surprise.
p225
aVThere's corruption everywhere, so why focus on that sector?
p226
aVWell, because there's a lot at stake.
p227
aVIn 2011, natural resource exports
p228
aVoutweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one
p229
aVin Africa, Asia and Latin America. Nineteen to one.
p230
aVNow that's a hell of a lot of schools and universities
p231
aVand hospitals and business startups,
p232
aVmany of which haven't materialized and never will
p233
aVbecause some of that money has simply been stolen away.
p234
aVNow let's go back to the oil and mining companies,
p235
aVand let's go back to Dan Etete and that $1 billion deal.
p236
aVAnd now forgive me, I'm going to read the next bit
p237
aVbecause it's a very live issue, and our lawyers
p238
aVhave been through this in some detail
p239
aVand they want me to get it right.
p240
aVNow, on the surface, the deal appeared straightforward.
p241
aVSubsidiaries of Shell and Eni
p242
aVpaid the Nigerian government for the block.
p243
aVThe Nigerian government transferred
p244
aVprecisely the same amount, to the very dollar,
p245
aVto an account earmarked for a shell company
p246
aVwhose hidden owner was Etete.
p247
aVNow, that's not bad going for a convicted money launderer.
p248
aVAnd here's the thing.
p249
aVAfter many months of digging around
p250
aVand reading through hundreds of pages of court documents,
p251
aVwe found evidence that, in fact,
p252
aVShell and Eni had known that the funds
p253
aVwould be transferred to that shell company,
p254
aVand frankly, it's hard to believe they didn't know
p255
aVwho they were really dealing with there.
p256
aVNow, it just shouldn't take these sorts of efforts
p257
aVto find out where the money in deals like this went.
p258
aVI mean, these are state assets.
p259
aVThey're supposed to be used for the benefit
p260
aVof the people in the country.
p261
aVBut in some countries, citizens and journalists
p262
aVwho are trying to expose stories like this
p263
aVhave been harassed and arrested
p264
aVand some have even risked their lives to do so.
p265
aVAnd finally, well, there are those who believe
p266
aVthat corruption is unavoidable.
p267
aVIt's just how some business is done.
p268
aVIt's too complex and difficult to change.
p269
aVSo in effect, what? We just accept it.
p270
aVBut as a campaigner and investigator,
p271
aVI have a different view,
p272
aVbecause I've seen what can happen
p273
aVwhen an idea gains momentum.
p274
aVIn the oil and mining sector, for example,
p275
aVthere is now the beginning
p276
aVof a truly worldwide transparency standard
p277
aVthat could tackle some of these problems.
p278
aVIn 1999, when Global Witness called
p279
aVfor oil companies to make payments on deals transparent,
p280
aVwell, some people laughed at the extreme naiveté
p281
aVof that small idea.
p282
aVBut literally hundreds of civil society groups
p283
aVfrom around the world came together
p284
aVto fight for transparency,
p285
aVand now it's fast becoming the norm and the law.
p286
aVTwo thirds of the value
p287
aVof the world's oil and mining companies
p288
aVare now covered by transparency laws. Two thirds.
p289
aVSo this is change happening.
p290
aVThis is progress.
p291
aVBut we're not there yet, by far.
p292
aVBecause it really isn't about corruption
p293
aVsomewhere over there, is it?
p294
aVIn a globalized world, corruption
p295
aVis a truly globalized business,
p296
aVand one that needs global solutions,
p297
aVsupported and pushed by us all, as global citizens,
p298
aVright here.
p299
aVThank you.

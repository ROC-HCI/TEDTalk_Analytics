VTwelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name
p5
aVto say, "I exist."
p6
aVThen I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street
p7
aVto say, "They exist."
p8
aVFrom the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine,
p9
aVthe rooftops of Kenya
p10
aVto the favelas of Rio,
p11
aVpaper and glue \u2014 as easy as that.
p12
aa(lp13
VI asked a question last year:
p14
aVCan art change the world?
p15
aVWell let me tell you,
p16
aVin terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year,
p17
aVbecause the Arab Spring is still spreading,
p18
aVthe Eurozone has collapsed ... what else?
p19
aVThe Occupy movement found a voice,
p20
aVand I still have to speak English constantly.
p21
aVSo there has been a lot of change.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo when I had my TED wish last year,
p24
aVI said, look, I'm going to switch my concept.
p25
aVYou are going to take the photos.
p26
aVYou're going to send them to me.
p27
aVI'm going to print them and send them back to you.
p28
aVThen you're going to paste them where it makes sense
p29
aVfor you to place your own statement.
p30
aa(lp31
VThis is Inside Out.
p32
aVOne hundred thousand posters have been printed this year.
p33
aVThose are the kind of posters, let me show you.
p34
aVAnd we keep sending more every day.
p35
aVThis is the size.
p36
aVJust a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it.
p37
aVThis one was from Haiti.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhen I launched my wish last year,
p40
aVhundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us.
p41
aVBut I say it has to be
p42
aVunder the conditions I've always worked:
p43
aVno credit, no logos, no sponsoring.
p44
aVA week later, a handful of people were there ready to rock
p45
aVand empower the people on the ground
p46
aVwho wanted to change the world.
p47
aVThese are the people I want to talk about to you today.
p48
aa(lp49
VTwo weeks after my speech, in Tunisia,
p50
aVhundreds of portraits were made.
p51
aVAnd they pasted [over] every single portrait of the dictator
p52
aV[with] their own photos.
p53
aVBoom! This is what happened.
p54
aVSlim and his friends went through the country
p55
aVand pasted hundreds of photos everywhere
p56
aVto show the diversity in the country.
p57
aVThey really make Inside Out their own project.
p58
aVActually, that photo was pasted in a police station,
p59
aVand what you see on the ground
p60
aVare ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police.
p61
aa(lp62
VRussia. Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia.
p63
aVHe went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe
p64
aVand stood there with the photos
p65
aVto say, "We have rights."
p66
aVThey used Inside Out as a platform for protest.
p67
aa(lp68
VKarachi, Pakistan.
p69
aVSharmeen is actually here.
p70
aVShe organized a TEDx action out there
p71
aVand made all the unseen faces of the city
p72
aVon the walls in her town.
p73
aVAnd I want to thank her today.
p74
aa(lp75
VNorth Dakota. Standing Rock Nation,
p76
aVin this Turtle Island, [unclear name] from the Dakota Lakota tribe
p77
aVwanted to show that the Native Americans are still here.
p78
aVThe seventh generation are still fighting for their rights.
p79
aVHe pasted up portraits all over his reservation.
p80
aVAnd he's here also today.
p81
aVEach time I get a wall in New York,
p82
aVI use his photos to continue spreading the project.
p83
aa(lp84
VJuarez: You've heard of the border \u2014
p85
aVone of the most dangerous borders in the world.
p86
aVMonica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers
p87
aVand covered the entire border.
p88
aVDo you know what it takes to do this?
p89
aVPeople, energy, make the glue, organize the team.
p90
aVIt was amazing.
p91
aa(lp92
VWhile in Iran at the same time
p93
aVAbololo \u2014 of course a nickname \u2014
p94
aVhas pasted one single face of a woman
p95
aVto show his resistance against the government.
p96
aVI don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action.
p97
aa(lp98
VThere are tons of school projects.
p99
aVTwenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools.
p100
aVEducation is so essential.
p101
aVKids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them,
p102
aVthey paste them on the school.
p103
aVHere they even got the help of the firemen.
p104
aVThere should be even more schools doing this kind of project.
p105
aa(lp106
VOf course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.
p107
aVSo we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck.
p108
aVYou go on the back of that truck, it takes your photo,
p109
aV30 seconds later take it from the side, you're ready to rock.
p110
aVThousands of people use them
p111
aVand each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution
p112
aVand then walk in the street.
p113
aVThis is march, the 450,000 march \u2014 beginning of September.
p114
aVThey were all holding their photo as a statement.
p115
aVOn the other side, people were wrapping up streets, buildings.
p116
aVIt's everywhere.
p117
aVCome on, don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there.
p118
aa(lp119
VThese projects took thousands of actions in one year,
p120
aVmaking hundreds of thousands of people participating,
p121
aVcreating millions of views.
p122
aVThis is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo back to the question, "Can art change the world?"
p125
aVMaybe not in one year. That's the beginning.
p126
aVBut maybe we should change the question.
p127
aVCan art change people's lives?
p128
aVFrom what I've seen this year, yes.
p129
aVAnd you know what? It's just the beginning.
p130
aVLet's turn the world inside out together.
p131
aVThank you.

Traveling to distant, often dangerous places -- the slums of Kenya, the favelas of Brazil -- he infiltrates communities, befriending inhabitants and recruiting them as models and collaborators. He gets in his subjects&rsquo; faces with a 28mm wide-angle lens, resulting in portraits that are unguarded, funny, soulful, real, that capture the sprits of individuals who normally go unseen. The blown-up images pasted on urban surfaces -&ndash; the sides of buses, on rooftops -- confront and engage audiences where they least expect it. Images of Parisian thugs are pasted up in bourgeois neighborhoods; photos of Israelis and Palestinians are posted together on both sides of the walls that separate them.</p><p><br />JR&#39;s gained widespread attention for his project, &quot;Women Are Heroes,&quot; which depicted women &quot;dealing with the effects of war, poverty, violence, and oppression&rdquo; from Rio de Janeiro, Phnom Penh and Delhi to several cities in Africa.

on buildings, trains and bridges, the often-guerrilla artist JR forces us to see each other. Traveling to distant, often dangerous places -- the slums of Kenya, the favelas of Brazil -- he infiltrates communities, befriending inhabitants and recruiting them as models and collaborators. He gets in his subjects&rsquo; faces with a 28mm wide-angle lens, resulting in portraits that are unguarded, funny, soulful, real, that capture the sprits of individuals who normally go unseen. The blown-up images pasted on urban surfaces -&ndash; the sides of buses, on rooftops -- confront and engage audiences where they least expect it. Images of Parisian thugs are pasted up in bourgeois neighborhoods; photos of Israelis and Palestinians are posted together on both sides of the walls that separate them.</p><p><br />JR&#39;s gained widespread attention for his project, &quot;Women Are Heroes,&quot; which depicted women &quot;dealing with the effects of war, poverty, violence, and oppression&rdquo; from Rio de Janeiro, Phnom Penh and Delhi to several cities in Africa. His TED Prize wish opened an even wider lens on the world.

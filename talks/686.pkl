VTo understand the business of mythology
p5
aVand what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do,
p6
aVyou have to hear a story
p7
aVof Ganesha,
p8
aVthe elephant-headed god
p9
aVwho is the scribe of storytellers,
p10
aVand his brother,
p11
aVthe athletic warlord of the gods,
p12
aVKartikeya.
p13
aVThe two brothers one day decided to go on a race,
p14
aVthree times around the world.
p15
aVKartikeya leapt on his peacock
p16
aVand flew around the continents
p17
aVand the mountains and the oceans.
p18
aVHe went around once,
p19
aVhe went around twice,
p20
aVhe went around thrice.
p21
aVBut his brother, Ganesha,
p22
aVsimply walked around his parents
p23
aVonce, twice, thrice,
p24
aVand said, "I won."
p25
aV"How come?" said Kartikeya.
p26
aVAnd Ganesha said,
p27
aV"You went around 'the world.'
p28
aVI went around 'my world.'"
p29
aVWhat matters more?
p30
aa(lp31
VIf you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,'
p32
aVyou understand the difference between logos and mythos.
p33
aV'The world' is objective,
p34
aVlogical, universal, factual,
p35
aVscientific.
p36
aV'My world' is subjective.
p37
aVIt's emotional. It's personal.
p38
aVIt's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams.
p39
aVIt is the belief system that we carry.
p40
aVIt's the myth that we live in.
p41
aa(lp42
V'The world' tells us how the world functions,
p43
aVhow the sun rises,
p44
aVhow we are born.
p45
aV'My world' tells us why the sun rises,
p46
aVwhy we were born.
p47
aVEvery culture is trying to understand itself:
p48
aV"Why do we exist?"
p49
aVAnd every culture comes up with its own understanding of life,
p50
aVits own customized version of mythology.
p51
aa(lp52
VCulture is a reaction to nature,
p53
aVand this understanding of our ancestors
p54
aVis transmitted generation from generation
p55
aVin the form of stories, symbols and rituals,
p56
aVwhich are always indifferent to rationality.
p57
aVAnd so, when you study it, you realize
p58
aVthat different people of the world
p59
aVhave a different understanding of the world.
p60
aVDifferent people see things differently \u2014
p61
aVdifferent viewpoints.
p62
aa(lp63
VThere is my world and there is your world,
p64
aVand my world is always better than your world,
p65
aVbecause my world, you see, is rational
p66
aVand yours is superstition.
p67
aVYours is faith.
p68
aVYours is illogical.
p69
aVThis is the root of the clash of civilizations.
p70
aVIt took place, once, in 326 B.C.
p71
aVon the banks of a river called the Indus,
p72
aVnow in Pakistan.
p73
aVThis river lends itself to India's name.
p74
aVIndia. Indus.
p75
aa(lp76
VAlexander, a young Macedonian,
p77
aVmet there what he called a "gymnosophist,"
p78
aVwhich means "the naked, wise man."
p79
aVWe don't know who he was.
p80
aVPerhaps he was a Jain monk,
p81
aVlike Bahubali over here,
p82
aVthe Gomateshwara Bahubali
p83
aVwhose image is not far from Mysore.
p84
aVOr perhaps he was just a yogi
p85
aVwho was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky
p86
aVand the sun and the moon.
p87
aa(lp88
VAlexander asked, "What are you doing?"
p89
aVand the gymnosophist answered,
p90
aV"I'm experiencing nothingness."
p91
aVThen the gymnosophist asked,
p92
aV"What are you doing?"
p93
aVand Alexander said, "I am conquering the world."
p94
aVAnd they both laughed.
p95
aVEach one thought that the other was a fool.
p96
aVThe gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world?
p97
aVIt's pointless."
p98
aVAnd Alexander thought,
p99
aV"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?
p100
aVWhat a waste of a life."
p101
aa(lp102
VTo understand this difference in viewpoints,
p103
aVwe have to understand
p104
aVthe subjective truth of Alexander \u2014
p105
aVhis myth, and the mythology that constructed it.
p106
aVAlexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle
p107
aVtold him the story of Homer's "Iliad."
p108
aVThey told him of a great hero called Achilles,
p109
aVwho, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,
p110
aVbut when he withdrew from the battle,
p111
aVdefeat was inevitable.
p112
aV"Achilles was a man who could shape history,
p113
aVa man of destiny,
p114
aVand this is what you should be, Alexander."
p115
aVThat's what he heard.
p116
aa(lp117
V"What should you not be?
p118
aVYou should not be Sisyphus,
p119
aVwho rolls a rock up a mountain all day
p120
aVonly to find the boulder rolled down at night.
p121
aVDon't live a life which is monotonous,
p122
aVmediocre, meaningless.
p123
aVBe spectacular! \u2014
p124
aVlike the Greek heroes,
p125
aVlike Jason, who went across the sea
p126
aVwith the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.
p127
aVBe spectacular like Theseus,
p128
aVwho entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.
p129
aVWhen you play in a race, win! \u2014
p130
aVbecause when you win, the exhilaration of victory
p131
aVis the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods."
p132
aa(lp133
VBecause, you see, the Greeks believed
p134
aVyou live only once,
p135
aVand when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.
p136
aVAnd if you have lived an extraordinary life,
p137
aVyou will be welcomed to Elysium,
p138
aVor what the French call "Champs-Élysées" \u2014
p139
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p140
aVthe heaven of the heroes.
p141
aa(lp142
VBut these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard.
p143
aVHe heard a very different story.
p144
aVHe heard of a man called Bharat,
p145
aVafter whom India is called Bh\u0101rata.
p146
aVBharat also conquered the world.
p147
aVAnd then he went to the top-most peak
p148
aVof the greatest mountain of the center of the world
p149
aVcalled Meru.
p150
aVAnd he wanted to hoist his flag to say,
p151
aV"I was here first."
p152
aVBut when he reached the mountain peak,
p153
aVhe found the peak covered with countless flags
p154
aVof world-conquerors before him,
p155
aVeach one claiming "'I was here first' ...
p156
aVthat's what I thought until I came here."
p157
aVAnd suddenly, in this canvas of infinity,
p158
aVBharat felt insignificant.
p159
aVThis was the mythology of the gymnosophist.
p160
aa(lp161
VYou see, he had heroes, like Ram \u2014 Raghupati Ram
p162
aVand Krishna, Govinda Hari.
p163
aVBut they were not two characters on two different adventures.
p164
aVThey were two lifetimes of the same hero.
p165
aVWhen the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.
p166
aVWhen Ram dies, Krishna is born.
p167
aVWhen Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.
p168
aa(lp169
VYou see, the Indians also had a river
p170
aVthat separates the land of the living from the land of the dead.
p171
aVBut you don't cross it once.
p172
aVYou go to and fro endlessly.
p173
aVIt was called the Vaitarani.
p174
aVYou go again and again and again.
p175
aVBecause, you see,
p176
aVnothing lasts forever in India, not even death.
p177
aVAnd so, you have these grand rituals
p178
aVwhere great images of mother goddesses are built
p179
aVand worshiped for 10 days ...
p180
aVAnd what do you do at the end of 10 days?
p181
aVYou dunk it in the river.
p182
aVBecause it has to end.
p183
aVAnd next year, she will come back.
p184
aVWhat goes around always comes around,
p185
aVand this rule applies not just to man,
p186
aVbut also the gods.
p187
aVYou see, the gods
p188
aVhave to come back again and again and again
p189
aVas Ram, as Krishna.
p190
aVNot only do they live infinite lives,
p191
aVbut the same life is lived infinite times
p192
aVtill you get to the point of it all.
p193
aV"Groundhog Day."
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VTwo different mythologies.
p197
aVWhich is right?
p198
aVTwo different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.
p199
aVOne linear, one cyclical.
p200
aVOne believes this is the one and only life.
p201
aVThe other believes this is one of many lives.
p202
aVAnd so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one.
p203
aVSo, the value of his life was the sum total
p204
aVof his achievements.
p205
aVThe denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.
p206
aVSo, no matter what he did,
p207
aVit was always zero.
p208
aVAnd I believe it is this mythological paradigm
p209
aVthat inspired Indian mathematicians
p210
aVto discover the number zero.
p211
aVWho knows?
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd that brings us to the mythology of business.
p214
aVIf Alexander's belief influenced his behavior,
p215
aVif the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior,
p216
aVthen it was bound to influence the business they were in.
p217
aVYou see, what is business
p218
aVbut the result of how the market behaves
p219
aVand how the organization behaves?
p220
aVAnd if you look at cultures around the world,
p221
aVall you have to do is understand the mythology
p222
aVand you will see how they behave and how they do business.
p223
aa(lp224
VTake a look.
p225
aVIf you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world,
p226
aVyou will see an obsession with binary logic,
p227
aVabsolute truth, standardization,
p228
aVabsoluteness, linear patterns in design.
p229
aVBut if you look at cultures which have cyclical
p230
aVand based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic,
p231
aVwith opinion,
p232
aVwith contextual thinking,
p233
aVwith everything is relative, sort of \u2014
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVmostly.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VYou look at art. Look at the ballerina,
p239
aVhow linear she is in her performance.
p240
aVAnd then look at the Indian classical dancer,
p241
aVthe Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,
p242
aVcurvaceous.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd then look at business.
p246
aVStandard business model:
p247
aVvision, mission, values, processes.
p248
aVSounds very much like the journey through
p249
aVthe wilderness to the promised land,
p250
aVwith the commandments held by the leader.
p251
aVAnd if you comply, you will go to heaven.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut in India there is no "the" promised land.
p254
aVThere are many promised lands,
p255
aVdepending on your station in society,
p256
aVdepending on your stage of life.
p257
aVYou see, businesses are not run as institutions,
p258
aVby the idiosyncrasies of individuals.
p259
aVIt's always about taste.
p260
aVIt's always about my taste.
p261
aa(lp262
VYou see, Indian music, for example,
p263
aVdoes not have the concept of harmony.
p264
aVThere is no orchestra conductor.
p265
aVThere is one performer standing there, and everybody follows.
p266
aVAnd you can never replicate that performance twice.
p267
aVIt is not about documentation and contract.
p268
aVIt's about conversation and faith.
p269
aVIt's not about compliance. It's about setting,
p270
aVgetting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules \u2014
p271
aVjust look at your Indian people around here,
p272
aVyou'll see them smile; they know what it is.
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVAnd then look at people who have done business in India,
p275
aVyou'll see the exasperation on their faces.
p276
aV(Laughter)
p277
aV(Applause)
p278
aa(lp279
VYou see, this is what India is today. The ground reality
p280
aVis based on a cyclical world view.
p281
aVSo, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse,
p282
aVchaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.
p283
aVAnd people are okay with it.
p284
aVAnd then globalization is taking place.
p285
aVThe demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in.
p286
aVWhich is rooted in one-life culture.
p287
aVAnd a clash is going to take place,
p288
aVlike on the banks of the Indus.
p289
aVIt is bound to happen.
p290
aa(lp291
VI have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor.
p292
aVI did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why.
p293
aVI love mythology too much.
p294
aVI wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study.
p295
aVSo, I had to teach it to myself.
p296
aVAnd mythology does not pay, well, until now.
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aVSo, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.
p299
aVAnd I worked in the healthcare industry.
p300
aVAnd I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy,
p301
aVand a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy.
p302
aVI even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics.
p303
aVAnd I would see the exasperation
p304
aVbetween my American and European colleagues,
p305
aVwhen they were dealing with India.
p306
aa(lp307
VExample: Please tell us the process
p308
aVto invoice hospitals.
p309
aVStep A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.
p310
aV(Laughter)
p311
aVHow do you parameterize "mostly"?
p312
aVHow do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.
p313
aa(lp314
VI would give my viewpoints to people.
p315
aVBut nobody was interested in listening to it,
p316
aVyou see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group.
p317
aVYou see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar.
p318
aVAnd there are more than 200 formats,
p319
aVacross 50 cities and towns of India.
p320
aVAnd he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets.
p321
aVAnd he knew very intuitively,
p322
aVthat best practices,
p323
aVdeveloped in Japan and China and Europe and America
p324
aVwill not work in India.
p325
aVHe knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does.
p326
aVHe had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said,
p329
aV"All I want to do is align belief."
p330
aVSounds so simple.
p331
aVBut belief is not measurable.
p332
aVYou can't measure it. You can't manage it.
p333
aVSo, how do you construct belief?
p334
aVHow do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness.
p335
aVEven if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo, I tried to work on the standard model of culture,
p338
aVwhich is, develop stories, symbols and rituals.
p339
aVAnd I will share one of the rituals with you.
p340
aVYou see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.
p341
aVHindus don't have the concept of commandments.
p342
aVSo, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.
p343
aVSo, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God.
p344
aVSo, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.
p345
aVYou want to see God.
p346
aVAnd you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,
p347
aVlarge unblinking eyes,
p348
aVsometimes made of silver,
p349
aVso they look at you.
p350
aVBecause you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek
p351
aVis divine empathy.
p352
aV"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad."
p353
aV(Laughter)
p354
aV"Why did I do the setting,
p355
aVwhy I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please."
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.
p358
aVAfter a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,
p359
aVwe blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,
p360
aVthe customer, his family, his team, his boss.
p361
aVYou read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,
p362
aVand then you remove the blindfold.
p363
aVAnd invariably, you see a tear,
p364
aVbecause the penny has dropped.
p365
aVHe realizes that to succeed,
p366
aVhe does not have to be a "professional,"
p367
aVhe does not have to cut out his emotions,
p368
aVhe has to include all these people
p369
aVin his world to succeed, to make them happy,
p370
aVto make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.
p371
aVThe customer is happy, because the customer is God.
p372
aa(lp373
VThat sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters,
p374
aVbehavior will happen, business will happen.
p375
aVAnd it has.
p376
aVSo, then we come back to Alexander
p377
aVand to the gymnosophist.
p378
aVAnd everybody asks me, "Which is the better way, this way or that way?"
p379
aVAnd it's a very dangerous question,
p380
aVbecause it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.
p381
aVSo, I will not answer the question.
p382
aVWhat I will give you is an Indian answer,
p383
aVthe Indian head-shake.
p384
aV(Laughter)
p385
aV(Applause)
p386
aa(lp387
VDepending on the context,
p388
aVdepending on the outcome,
p389
aVchoose your paradigm.
p390
aVYou see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.
p391
aVThey are cultural creations,
p392
aVnot natural phenomena.
p393
aVAnd so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,
p394
aVone request:
p395
aVUnderstand that you live in the subjective truth,
p396
aVand so does he.
p397
aVUnderstand it.
p398
aVAnd when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.
p399
aVYou will discover that within infinite myths
p400
aVlies the eternal truth.
p401
aVWho sees it all?
p402
aVVaruna has but a thousand eyes.
p403
aVIndra, a hundred.
p404
aVYou and I, only two.
p405
aVThank you. Namaste.
p406
aV(Applause)

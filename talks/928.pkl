VLast year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim
p5
aVwhich I did across the North Pole.
p6
aVAnd while that swim took place three years ago,
p7
aVI can remember it as if it was yesterday.
p8
aVI remember standing on the edge of the ice,
p9
aVabout to dive into the water,
p10
aVand thinking to myself, I have never ever
p11
aVseen any place on this earth
p12
aVwhich is just so frightening.
p13
aVThe water is completely black.
p14
aVThe water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade,
p15
aVor 29 degrees Fahrenheit.
p16
aVIt's flipping freezing in that water.
p17
aVAnd then a thought came across my mind:
p18
aVif things go pear-shaped on this swim,
p19
aVhow long will it take for my frozen body
p20
aVto sink the four and a half kilometers
p21
aVto the bottom of the ocean?
p22
aVAnd then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought
p23
aVout of my mind as quickly as possible.
p24
aVAnd the only way I can dive
p25
aVinto that freezing cold water
p26
aVand swim a kilometer
p27
aVis by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up,
p28
aVlistening to everything from beautiful opera
p29
aVall the way across to Puff Daddy,
p30
aVand then committing myself a hundred percent \u2014
p31
aVthere is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind \u2014
p32
aVand then walking up to the edge of the ice
p33
aVand just diving into the water.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd that swim took me
p36
aV18 minutes and 50 seconds,
p37
aVand it felt like 18 days.
p38
aVAnd I remember getting out of the water
p39
aVand my hands feeling so painful
p40
aVand looking down at my fingers,
p41
aVand my fingers were literally the size of sausages
p42
aVbecause \u2014 you know, we're made partially of water \u2014
p43
aVwhen water freezes it expands,
p44
aVand so the cells in my fingers
p45
aVhad frozen and expanded
p46
aVand burst.
p47
aVAnd the most immediate thought when I came out of that water
p48
aVwas the following:
p49
aVI'm never, ever
p50
aVgoing to do another cold water swim
p51
aVin my life again.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnyway, last year, I heard about the Himalayas
p54
aVand the melting of the \u2014 (Laughter)
p55
aVand the melting of the glaciers
p56
aVbecause of climate change.
p57
aVI heard about this lake, Lake Imja.
p58
aVThis lake has been formed in the last couple of years
p59
aVbecause of the melting of the glacier.
p60
aVThe glacier's gone all the way up the mountain
p61
aVand left in its place this big lake.
p62
aVAnd I firmly believe
p63
aVthat what we're seeing in the Himalayas
p64
aVis the next great, big battleground
p65
aVon this earth.
p66
aVNearly two billion people \u2014
p67
aVso one in three people on this earth \u2014
p68
aVrely on the water from the Himalayas.
p69
aVAnd with a population increasing as quickly as it is,
p70
aVand with the water supply from these glaciers \u2014
p71
aVbecause of climate change \u2014
p72
aVdecreasing so much,
p73
aVI think we have a real risk of instability.
p74
aVNorth, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
p75
aVall these countries.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd so I decided
p78
aVto walk up to Mt. Everest,
p79
aVthe highest mountain on this earth,
p80
aVand go and do a symbolic swim
p81
aVunderneath the summit
p82
aVof Mt. Everest.
p83
aVNow, I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest,
p84
aVbut it's quite an ordeal getting up there.
p85
aV28 great, big, powerful yaks
p86
aVcarrying all the equipment up onto this mountain \u2014
p87
aVI don't just have my Speedo,
p88
aVbut there's a big film crew who then
p89
aVsend all the images around the world.
p90
aVThe other thing which was so challenging about this swim
p91
aVis not just the altitude.
p92
aVI wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.
p93
aVSo it's right up in the heavens.
p94
aVIt's very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness.
p95
aVI feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer
p96
aVjust hitting your head all the time.
p97
aa(lp98
VThat's not the worst part of it.
p99
aVThe worst part was this year was the year where they decided
p100
aVto do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.
p101
aVMany, many people have died on Mt. Everest,
p102
aVand this was the year they decided to go
p103
aVand recover all the bodies of the mountaineers
p104
aVand then bring them down the mountain.
p105
aVAnd when you're walking up the mountain
p106
aVto attempt to do something
p107
aVwhich no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish \u2014
p108
aVthere are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters \u2014
p109
aVWhen you're trying to do that,
p110
aVand then the bodies are coming past you,
p111
aVit humbles you,
p112
aVand you also realize very, very clearly
p113
aVthat nature is so much more powerful
p114
aVthan we are.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd we walked up this pathway,
p117
aVall the way up.
p118
aVAnd to the right hand side of us
p119
aVwas this great Khumbu Glacier.
p120
aVAnd all the way along the glacier we saw
p121
aVthese big pools of melting ice.
p122
aVAnd then we got up to this small lake
p123
aVunderneath the summit of Mt. Everest,
p124
aVand I prepared myself
p125
aVthe same way as I've always prepared myself,
p126
aVfor this swim which was going to be so very difficult.
p127
aVI put on my iPod, I listened to some music,
p128
aVI got myself as aggressive as possible \u2014
p129
aVbut controlled aggression \u2014
p130
aVand then I hurled myself
p131
aVinto that water.
p132
aa(lp133
VI swam as quickly as I could
p134
aVfor the first hundred meters,
p135
aVand then I realized very, very quickly,
p136
aVI had a huge problem on my hands.
p137
aVI could barely breathe.
p138
aVI was gasping for air.
p139
aVI then began to choke,
p140
aVand then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.
p141
aVAnd it all happened so quickly:
p142
aVI then \u2014 I don't know how it happened \u2014 but I went underwater.
p143
aVAnd luckily, the water was quite shallow,
p144
aVand I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake
p145
aVand get up and then take another gasp of air.
p146
aVAnd then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.
p147
aVI carried on for another five or six strokes,
p148
aVand then I had nothing in my body,
p149
aVand I went down to the bottom of the lake.
p150
aVAnd I don't where I got it from,
p151
aVbut I was able to somehow
p152
aVpull myself up and as quickly as possible
p153
aVget to the side of the lake.
p154
aVI've heard it said that drowning
p155
aVis the most peaceful death that you can have.
p156
aVI have never, ever heard
p157
aVsuch utter bollocks.
p158
aV(Laughter)
p159
aVIt is the most frightening and panicky feeling
p160
aVthat you can have.
p161
aa(lp162
VI got myself to the side of the lake.
p163
aVMy crew grabbed me,
p164
aVand then we walked as quickly as we could
p165
aVdown \u2014 over the rubble \u2014
p166
aVdown to our camp.
p167
aVAnd there, we sat down,
p168
aVand we did a debrief about what had gone wrong
p169
aVthere on Mt. Everest.
p170
aVAnd my team just gave it to me straight.
p171
aVThey said, Lewis, you need to have
p172
aVa radical tactical shift
p173
aVif you want to do this swim.
p174
aVEvery single thing which you have learned
p175
aVin the past 23 years of swimming,
p176
aVyou must forget.
p177
aVEvery single thing which you learned
p178
aVwhen you were serving in the British army,
p179
aVabout speed and aggression,
p180
aVyou put that to one side.
p181
aVWe want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.
p182
aVTake some time to rest and think about things.
p183
aVWe want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time,
p184
aVand instead of swimming fast,
p185
aVswim as slowly as possible.
p186
aVInstead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.
p187
aVAnd remember, never ever swim with aggression.
p188
aVThis is the time to swim
p189
aVwith real humility.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd so we walked back up
p192
aVto the mountain two days later.
p193
aVAnd I stood there
p194
aVon the edge of the lake,
p195
aVand I looked up at Mt. Everest \u2014
p196
aVand she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth \u2014
p197
aVand I said to myself, just do this slowly.
p198
aVAnd I swam across the lake.
p199
aVAnd I can't begin to tell you
p200
aVhow good I felt
p201
aVwhen I came to the other side.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut I learned two very, very
p204
aVimportant lessons there on Mt. Everest,
p205
aVand I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.
p206
aVThe first one is
p207
aVthat just because something has worked in the past so well,
p208
aVdoesn't mean it's going to work in the future.
p209
aVAnd similarly,
p210
aVnow, before I do anything,
p211
aVI ask myself what type of mindset
p212
aVdo I require
p213
aVto successfully complete a task.
p214
aVAnd taking that into the world of climate change \u2014
p215
aVwhich is, frankly,
p216
aVthe Mt. Everest of all problems \u2014
p217
aVjust because we've lived the way we have lived for so long,
p218
aVjust because we have consumed the way we have for so long
p219
aVand populated the earth the way we have for so long,
p220
aVdoesn't mean that we can carry on
p221
aVthe way we are carrying on.
p222
aVThe warning signs are all there.
p223
aVWhen I was born, the world's population
p224
aVwas 3.5 billion people.
p225
aVWe're now 6.8 billion people,
p226
aVand we're expected to be 9 billion people
p227
aVby 2050.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd then the second lesson,
p230
aVthe radical, tactical shift.
p231
aVAnd I've come here to ask you today:
p232
aVwhat radical tactical shift
p233
aVcan you take in your relationship to the environment,
p234
aVwhich will ensure
p235
aVthat our children and our grandchildren
p236
aVlive in a safe world
p237
aVand a secure world,
p238
aVand most importantly, in a sustainable world?
p239
aVAnd I ask you, please, to go away from here
p240
aVand think about that one
p241
aVradical tactical shift
p242
aVwhich you could make,
p243
aVwhich will make that big difference,
p244
aVand then commit a hundred percent to doing it.
p245
aVBlog about it, tweet about it, talk about it,
p246
aVand commit a hundred percent,
p247
aVbecause very, very few things
p248
aVare impossible to achieve
p249
aVif we really put our whole minds to it.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo thank you very, very much.

In 2006, he swam the drought-stricken Thames; also that year he became the first swimmer to do a long-distance swim in all five oceans of the world. The following year, he made the first long-distance swim across the North Pole -- where climate change made the ice temporarily disappear. Heading into the second decade of his swimming career, he&#39;s regarded as the greatest cold-water swimmer in history. <br /><br />His swims have given him a sea-level view of our planet, and inspired him to do his bit to help preserve it. He left a career in maritime law to become a public speaker on environmental issues with his group, Polar Defence Project -- and of course to plan more astonishing swims and treks. In September 2008, Pugh and Robbie Hedgus kayaked across the Arctic Ocean into the polar ice pack, to raise awareness of the thinning sea ice and the dangers of climate change in the Arctic and across the world. And at the end of May 2010 he swam 1 kilometer across Pumori, a meltwater lake situated next to the Khumbu Glacier on Mount Everest, at an altitude of 5300 meters, to draw attention to the melting of the Asian glaciers. He completed the swim -- the highest any person has undertaken -- in less than 23 minutes. &quot;Glaciers are not just ice: they are a lifeline, they provide water to 2 billion people, and we need to protect them,&quot; he says. </p>", "slug": "lewis_pugh", "whotheyare": "Pushing his body through epic cold-water swims, Lewis Gordon Pugh wants to draw attention to our global climate.

In 2006, he swam the drought-stricken Thames; also that year he became the first swimmer to do a long-distance swim in all five oceans of the world. The following year, he made the first long-distance swim across the North Pole -- where climate change made the ice temporarily disappear. Heading into the second decade of his swimming career, he&#39;s regarded as the greatest cold-water swimmer in history. <br /><br />His swims have given him a sea-level view of our planet, and inspired him to do his bit to help preserve it. He left a career in maritime law to become a public speaker on environmental issues with his group, Polar Defence Project -- and of course to plan more astonishing swims and treks. In September 2008, Pugh and Robbie Hedgus kayaked across the Arctic Ocean into the polar ice pack, to raise awareness of the thinning sea ice and the dangers of climate change in the Arctic and across the world. And at the end of May 2010 he swam 1 kilometer across Pumori, a meltwater lake situated next to the Khumbu Glacier on Mount Everest, at an altitude of 5300 meters, to draw attention to the melting of the Asian glaciers. He completed the swim -- the highest any person has undertaken -- in less than 23 minutes. &quot;Glaciers are not just ice: they are a lifeline, they provide water to 2 billion people, and we need to protect them,&quot; he says. </p>", "slug": "lewis_pugh", "whotheyare": "Pushing his body through epic cold-water swims, Lewis Gordon Pugh wants to draw attention to our global climate.

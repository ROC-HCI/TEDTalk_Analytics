VI'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are,
p5
aVhow globalized we aren't,
p6
aVand why it's important to actually be accurate
p7
aVin making those kinds of assessments.
p8
aVAnd the leading point of view on this, whether measured
p9
aVby number of books sold, mentions in media,
p10
aVor surveys that I've run with groups ranging from
p11
aVmy students to delegates to the World Trade Organization,
p12
aVis this view that national borders
p13
aVreally don't matter very much anymore,
p14
aVcross-border integration is close to complete,
p15
aVand we live in one world.
p16
aVAnd what's interesting about this view
p17
aVis, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizers
p18
aVlike Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted,
p19
aVbut it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giant
p20
aVglobalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives
p21
aVif it hasn't already done so.
p22
aa(lp23
VThe other thing I would add is that this is not a new view.
p24
aVI'm a little bit of an amateur historian, so I've spent
p25
aVsome time going back, trying to see the first mention
p26
aVof this kind of thing. And the best, earliest quote
p27
aVthat I could find was one from David Livingstone,
p28
aVwriting in the 1850s about how the railroad, the steam ship,
p29
aVand the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly
p30
aVwith the rest of the world.
p31
aVNow clearly, David Livingstone
p32
aVwas a little bit ahead of his time,
p33
aVbut it does seem useful to ask ourselves,
p34
aV"Just how global are we?"
p35
aVbefore we think about where we go from here.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo the best way I've found of trying to get people
p38
aVto take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat,
p39
aVmay not even be close to flat, is with some data.
p40
aVSo one of the things I've been doing over the last few years
p41
aVis really compiling data on things that could either happen
p42
aVwithin national borders or across national borders,
p43
aVand I've looked at the cross-border component
p44
aVas a percentage of the total.
p45
aVI'm not going to present all the data that I have here today,
p46
aVbut let me just give you a few data points.
p47
aVI'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow,
p48
aVone kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital,
p49
aVand, of course, trade in products and services.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo let's start off with plain old telephone service.
p52
aVOf all the voice-calling minutes in the world last year,
p53
aVwhat percentage do you think were accounted for
p54
aVby cross-border phone calls?
p55
aVPick a percentage in your own mind.
p56
aVThe answer turns out to be two percent.
p57
aVIf you include Internet telephony, you might be able
p58
aVto push this number up to six or seven percent,
p59
aVbut it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate.
p60
aa(lp61
VOr let's turn to people moving across borders.
p62
aVOne particular thing we might look at, in terms of
p63
aVlong-term flows of people, is what percentage
p64
aVof the world's population is accounted for
p65
aVby first-generation immigrants?
p66
aVAgain, please pick a percentage.
p67
aVTurns out to be a little bit higher.
p68
aVIt's actually about three percent.
p69
aa(lp70
VOr think of investment. Take all the real investment
p71
aVthat went on in the world in 2010.
p72
aVWhat percentage of that was accounted for
p73
aVby foreign direct investment?
p74
aVNot quite ten percent.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd then finally, the one statistic
p77
aVthat I suspect many of the people in this room have seen:
p78
aVthe export-to-GDP ratio.
p79
aVIf you look at the official statistics, they typically indicate
p80
aVa little bit above 30 percent.
p81
aVHowever, there's a big problem with the official statistics,
p82
aVin that if, for instance, a Japanese component supplier
p83
aVships something to China to be put into an iPod,
p84
aVand then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.,
p85
aVthat component ends up getting counted multiple times.
p86
aVSo nobody knows how bad this bias
p87
aVwith the official statistics actually is, so I thought I would
p88
aVask the person who's spearheading the effort
p89
aVto generate data on this, Pascal Lamy,
p90
aVthe Director of the World Trade Organization,
p91
aVwhat his best guess would be
p92
aVof exports as a percentage of GDP,
p93
aVwithout the double- and triple-counting,
p94
aVand it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent, rather than
p95
aVthe 30 percent-plus numbers that we're talking about.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo it's very clear that if you look at these numbers
p98
aVor all the other numbers that I talk about in my book,
p99
aV"World 3.0," that we're very, very far from
p100
aVthe no-border effect benchmark, which would imply
p101
aVinternationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent.
p102
aVSo clearly, apocalyptically-minded authors
p103
aVhave overstated the case.
p104
aVBut it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them,
p105
aVwho are prone to this kind of overstatement.
p106
aVI've also spent some time surveying audiences
p107
aVin different parts of the world
p108
aVon what they actually guess these numbers to be.
p109
aVLet me share with you the results of a survey
p110
aVthat Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run
p111
aVof its readership as to what people's guesses
p112
aValong these dimensions actually were.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide.
p115
aVFirst of all, there is a suggestion of some error.
p116
aVOkay. (Laughter)
p117
aVSecond, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities
p118
aVwhose average value is less than 10 percent,
p119
aVyou have people guessing three, four times that level.
p120
aVEven though I'm an economist, I find that
p121
aVa pretty large error.
p122
aVAnd third, this is not just confined to the readers
p123
aVof the Harvard Business Review.
p124
aVI've run several dozen such surveys in different parts
p125
aVof the world, and in all cases except one,
p126
aVwhere a group actually underestimated
p127
aVthe trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendency
p128
aVtowards overestimation, and so I thought it important
p129
aVto give a name to this, and that's what I refer to
p130
aVas globaloney, the difference between the dark blue bars
p131
aVand the light gray bars.
p132
aa(lp133
VEspecially because, I suspect, some of you may still be
p134
aVa little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important
p135
aVto just spend a little bit of time thinking about
p136
aVwhy we might be prone to globaloney.
p137
aVA couple of different reasons come to mind.
p138
aVFirst of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate.
p139
aVLet me give you an example. When I first published
p140
aVsome of these data a few years ago
p141
aVin a magazine called Foreign Policy,
p142
aVone of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement,
p143
aVwas Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled
p144
aV"Why the World Isn't Flat," that wasn't too surprising. (Laughter)
p145
aVWhat was very surprising to me was Tom's critique,
p146
aVwhich was, "Ghemawat's data are narrow."
p147
aVAnd this caused me to scratch my head, because
p148
aVas I went back through his several-hundred-page book,
p149
aVI couldn't find a single figure, chart, table,
p150
aVreference or footnote.
p151
aVSo my point is, I haven't presented a lot of data here
p152
aVto convince you that I'm right, but I would urge you
p153
aVto go away and look for your own data
p154
aVto try and actually assess whether some of these
p155
aVhand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with
p156
aVactually are correct.
p157
aVSo dearth of data in the debate is one reason.
p158
aa(lp159
VA second reason has to do with peer pressure.
p160
aVI remember, I decided to write my
p161
aV"Why the World Isn't Flat" article, because
p162
aVI was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai,
p163
aVand the interviewer's first question to me was,
p164
aV"Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believe
p165
aVthat the world is round?" And I started laughing,
p166
aVbecause I hadn't come across that formulation before. (Laughter)
p167
aVAnd as I was laughing, I was thinking,
p168
aVI really need a more coherent response, especially
p169
aVon national TV. I'd better write something about this. (Laughter)
p170
aVBut what I can't quite capture for you
p171
aVwas the pity and disbelief
p172
aVwith which the interviewer asked her question.
p173
aVThe perspective was, here is this poor professor.
p174
aVHe's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years.
p175
aVHe really has no idea
p176
aVas to what's actually going on in the world.
p177
aVSo try this out with your friends and acquaintances,
p178
aVif you like. You'll find that it's very cool
p179
aVto talk about the world being one, etc.
p180
aVIf you raise questions about that formulation,
p181
aVyou really are considered a bit of an antique.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd then the final reason, which I mention,
p184
aVespecially to a TED audience, with some trepidation,
p185
aVhas to do with what I call "techno-trances."
p186
aVIf you listen to techno music for long periods of time,
p187
aVit does things to your brainwave activity. (Laughter)
p188
aVSomething similar seems to happen
p189
aVwith exaggerated conceptions of how technology
p190
aVis going to overpower in the very immediate run
p191
aVall cultural barriers, all political barriers,
p192
aVall geographic barriers, because at this point
p193
aVI know you aren't allowed to ask me questions,
p194
aVbut when I get to this point in my lecture with my students,
p195
aVhands go up, and people ask me,
p196
aV"Yeah, but what about Facebook?"
p197
aVAnd I got this question often enough that I thought
p198
aVI'd better do some research on Facebook.
p199
aVBecause, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technology
p200
aVto think about. Theoretically, it makes it
p201
aVas easy to form friendships halfway around the world
p202
aVas opposed to right next door.
p203
aVWhat percentage of people's friends on Facebook
p204
aVare actually located in countries other than where
p205
aVpeople we're analyzing are based?
p206
aVThe answer is probably somewhere between
p207
aV10 to 15 percent.
p208
aVNon-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely local
p209
aVor national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent level
p210
aVthat you would expect, and the reason's very simple.
p211
aVWe don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at random
p212
aVon Facebook. The technology is overlaid
p213
aVon a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have,
p214
aVand those relationships are what the technology
p215
aVdoesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why
p216
aVwe get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends
p217
aVbeing located in countries other than where we are.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo does all this matter? Or is globaloney
p220
aVjust a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention
p221
aVto globalization-related issues?
p222
aVI want to suggest that actually,
p223
aVglobaloney can be very harmful to your health.
p224
aVFirst of all, recognizing that the glass
p225
aVis only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing
p226
aVthat there might be potential for additional gains
p227
aVfrom additional integration,
p228
aVwhereas if we thought we were already there,
p229
aVthere would be no particular point to pushing harder.
p230
aVIt's a little bit like, we wouldn't be having a conference
p231
aVon radical openness if we already thought we were totally open
p232
aVto all the kinds of influences that are being talked about
p233
aVat this conference.
p234
aVSo being accurate about how limited globalization levels are
p235
aVis critical to even being able to notice
p236
aVthat there might be room for something more,
p237
aVsomething that would contribute further to global welfare.
p238
aa(lp239
VWhich brings me to my second point.
p240
aVAvoiding overstatement is also very helpful
p241
aVbecause it reduces and in some cases even reverses
p242
aVsome of the fears that people have about globalization.
p243
aVSo I actually spend most of my "World 3.0" book
p244
aVworking through a litany of market failures and fears
p245
aVthat people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate.
p246
aVI'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today,
p247
aVso let me just present to you two headlines
p248
aVas an illustration of what I have in mind.
p249
aVThink of France and the current debate about immigration.
p250
aVWhen you ask people in France what percentage
p251
aVof the French population is immigrants,
p252
aVthe answer is about 24 percent. That's their guess.
p253
aVMaybe realizing that the number is just eight percent
p254
aVmight help cool some of the superheated rhetoric
p255
aVthat we see around the immigration issue.
p256
aVOr to take an even more striking example,
p257
aVwhen the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations
p258
aVdid a survey of Americans, asking them to guess
p259
aVwhat percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid,
p260
aVthe guess was 30 percent, which is
p261
aVslightly in excess of the actual level \u2014 ("actually about ... 1%") (Laughter) \u2014
p262
aVof U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid.
p263
aVThe reassuring thing about this particular survey was,
p264
aVwhen it was pointed out to people how far
p265
aVtheir estimates were from the actual data,
p266
aVsome of them \u2014 not all of them \u2014 seemed to become
p267
aVmore willing to consider increases in foreign aid.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo foreign aid is actually a great way
p270
aVof sort of wrapping up here, because
p271
aVif you think about it, what I've been talking about today
p272
aVis this notion \u2014 very uncontroversial amongst economists \u2014
p273
aVthat most things are very home-biased.
p274
aV"Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people,"
p275
aVis about the most home-biased thing you can find.
p276
aVIf you look at the OECD countries and how much
p277
aVthey spend per domestic poor person,
p278
aVand compare it with how much they spend
p279
aVper poor person in poor countries,
p280
aVthe ratio \u2014 Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations \u2014
p281
aVturns out to be about 30,000 to one.
p282
aVNow of course, some of us, if we truly are cosmopolitan,
p283
aVwould like to see that ratio being brought down
p284
aVto one-is-to-one.
p285
aVI'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim
p286
aVfor that to make substantial progress from where we are.
p287
aVIf we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one,
p288
aVwe would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed
p289
aVat the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summit
p290
aVthat ended last week made no further progress on.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo in summary, while radical openness is great,
p293
aVgiven how closed we are,
p294
aVeven incremental openness could make things
p295
aVdramatically better. Thank you very much. (Applause)

views of globalization: either that it is done and the world is flat (a view popularized by Tom Friedman) or that it has led to a world dominated by corporations (Naomi Klein). Pankaj Ghemawat disagrees with both -- and his case, backed by data, can be convincing. His most recent book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.ghemawat.com/books.aspx\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>World 3.0</em></a>, based on extensive research and backed up with abundant data, explores the true face of globalization--and shows that the world is not one vast market, but many small, interconnected, discrete entities, with varying degrees of openness to one another. That even the most open economies are still relatively closed. That we live in a world of semi-globalization at best. Ghemawat also refutes the assumption that globalization leads to homogeneization. According to <em>The Economist</em>, <em>World 3.0</em> &ldquo;should be read by anyone who wants to understand the most important economic development of our time.&rdquo;</p><p>Ghemawat is a professor of strategic management at&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.iese.edu/aplicaciones/faculty/facultyDetail.asp?lang=en&amp;prof=PG\\" target=\\"_blank\\">IESE Business School</a>&nbsp;in Spain.

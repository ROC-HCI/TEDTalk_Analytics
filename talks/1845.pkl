VAs humans, it's in our nature
p5
aVto want to improve our health  and minimize our suffering.
p6
aVWhatever life throws at us,
p7
aVwhether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease,
p8
aVor even broken bones, we want to try and get better.
p9
aVNow I'm head of a biomaterials lab,
p10
aVand I'm really fascinated by the way that humans
p11
aVhave used materials in really creative ways
p12
aVin the body over time.
p13
aa(lp14
VTake, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell.
p15
aVThis was actually used by the Mayans
p16
aVas an artificial tooth replacement.
p17
aVWe're not quite sure why they did it.
p18
aVIt's hard. It's durable.
p19
aVBut it also had other very nice properties.
p20
aVIn fact, when they put it into the jawbone,
p21
aVit could integrate into the jaw,
p22
aVand we know now with very sophisticated
p23
aVimaging technologies
p24
aVthat part of that integration comes from the fact
p25
aVthat this material is designed
p26
aVin a very specific way, has a beautiful chemistry,
p27
aVhas a beautiful architecture.
p28
aVAnd I think in many ways we can sort of think
p29
aVof the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans
p30
aVas the first real application
p31
aVof the bluetooth technology.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VBut if we move on and think throughout history
p36
aVhow people have used different  materials in the body,
p37
aVvery often it's been physicians
p38
aVthat have been quite creative.
p39
aVThey've taken things off the shelf.
p40
aa(lp41
VOne of my favorite examples
p42
aVis that of Sir Harold Ridley,
p43
aVwho was a famous ophthalmologist,
p44
aVor at least became a famous ophthalmologist.
p45
aVAnd during World War II, what he would see
p46
aVwould be pilots coming back from their missions,
p47
aVand he noticed that within their eyes
p48
aVthey had shards of small bits of material
p49
aVlodged within the eye,
p50
aVbut the very interesting thing about it
p51
aVwas that material, actually, wasn't causing
p52
aVany inflammatory response.
p53
aVSo he looked into this, and he figured out
p54
aVthat actually that material was little shards of plastic
p55
aVthat were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires.
p56
aVAnd this led him to propose that material
p57
aVas a new material for intraocular lenses.
p58
aVIt's called PMMA, and it's now used
p59
aVin millions of people every year
p60
aVand helps in preventing cataracts.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd that example, I think, is a really nice one,
p63
aVbecause it helps remind us that in the early days,
p64
aVpeople often chose materials
p65
aVbecause they were bioinert.
p66
aVTheir very purpose was to  perform a mechanical function.
p67
aVYou'd put them in the body
p68
aVand you wouldn't get an adverse response.
p69
aVAnd what I want to show you is that
p70
aVin regenerative medicine,
p71
aVwe've really shifted away from that idea
p72
aVof taking a bioinert material.
p73
aVWe're actually actively looking for materials
p74
aVthat will be bioactive, that will interact with the body,
p75
aVand that furthermore we can put in the body,
p76
aVthey'll have their function,
p77
aVand then they'll dissolve away over time.
p78
aa(lp79
VIf we look at this schematic,
p80
aVthis is showing you what we think of
p81
aVas the typical tissue-engineering approach.
p82
aVWe have cells there, typically from the patient.
p83
aVWe can put those onto a material,
p84
aVand we can make that material  very complex if we want to,
p85
aVand we can then grow that up in the lab
p86
aVor we can put it straight back into the patient.
p87
aVAnd this is an approach that's  used all over the world,
p88
aVincluding in our lab.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut one of the things that's really important
p91
aVwhen we're thinking about stem cells
p92
aVis that obviously stem cells  can be many different things,
p93
aVand they want to be many different things,
p94
aVand so we want to make sure that the environment
p95
aVwe put them into has enough information
p96
aVso that they can become the right sort
p97
aVof specialist tissue.
p98
aVAnd if we think about the different types of tissues
p99
aVthat people are looking at regenerating
p100
aVall over the world, in all the  different labs in the world,
p101
aVthere's pretty much every tissue you can think of.
p102
aVAnd actually, the structure of those tissues
p103
aVis quite different, and it's going to really depend
p104
aVon whether your patient has any underlying disease,
p105
aVother conditions, in terms of how
p106
aVyou're going to regenerate your tissue,
p107
aVand you're going to need to think about the materials
p108
aVyou're going to use really carefully,
p109
aVtheir biochemistry, their mechanics,
p110
aVand many other properties as well.
p111
aa(lp112
VOur tissues all have very  different abilities to regenerate,
p113
aVand here we see poor Prometheus,
p114
aVwho made a rather tricky career choice
p115
aVand was punished by the Greek gods.
p116
aVHe was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come
p117
aVevery day to eat his liver.
p118
aVBut of course his liver would regenerate every day,
p119
aVand so day after day he was punished
p120
aVfor eternity by the gods.
p121
aVAnd liver will regenerate in this very nice way,
p122
aVbut actually if we think of other tissues,
p123
aVlike cartilage, for example,
p124
aVeven the simplest nick and you're going to find it
p125
aVreally difficult to regenerate your cartilage.
p126
aVSo it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow, bone is somewhere in between,
p129
aVand this is one of the tissues  that we work on a lot in our lab.
p130
aVAnd bone is actually quite good at repairing.
p131
aVIt has to be. We've probably all had fractures
p132
aVat some point or other.
p133
aVAnd one of the ways that you can think
p134
aVabout repairing your fracture
p135
aVis this procedure here, called  an iliac crest harvest.
p136
aVAnd what the surgeon might do
p137
aVis take some bone from your iliac crest,
p138
aVwhich is just here,
p139
aVand then transplant that  somewhere else in the body.
p140
aVAnd it actually works really well,
p141
aVbecause it's your own bone,
p142
aVand it's well vascularized,
p143
aVwhich means it's got a really good blood supply.
p144
aVBut the problem is, there's only so much you can take,
p145
aVand also when you do that operation,
p146
aVyour patients might actually have significant pain
p147
aVin that defect site even two  years after the operation.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo what we were thinking is,
p150
aVthere's a tremendous need  for bone repair, of course,
p151
aVbut this iliac crest-type approach
p152
aVreally has a lot of limitations to it,
p153
aVand could we perhaps recreate
p154
aVthe generation of bone within the body
p155
aVon demand and then be able to transplant it
p156
aVwithout these very, very painful aftereffects
p157
aVthat you would have with the iliac crest harvest?
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd so this is what we did, and the way we did it
p160
aVwas by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach
p161
aVbut actually thinking about it rather differently.
p162
aVAnd we simplified it a lot,
p163
aVso we got rid of a lot of these steps.
p164
aVWe got rid of the need to  harvest cells from the patient,
p165
aVwe got rid of the need to put  in really fancy chemistries,
p166
aVand we got rid of the need
p167
aVto culture these scaffolds in the lab.
p168
aVAnd what we really focused on
p169
aVwas our material system and making it quite simple,
p170
aVbut because we used it in a really clever way,
p171
aVwe were able to generate enormous amounts of bone
p172
aVusing this approach.
p173
aVSo we were using the body
p174
aVas really the catalyst to help us
p175
aVto make lots of new bone.
p176
aVAnd it's an approach that we call
p177
aVthe in vivo bioreactor, and we were able to make
p178
aVenormous amounts of bone using this approach.
p179
aVAnd I'll talk you through this.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo what we do is,
p182
aVin humans, we all have a layer of stem cells
p183
aVon the outside of our long bones.
p184
aVThat layer is called the periosteum.
p185
aVAnd that layer is actually normally
p186
aVvery, very tightly bound to the underlying bone,
p187
aVand it's got stem cells in it.
p188
aVThose stem cells are really important
p189
aVin the embryo when it develops,
p190
aVand they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture
p191
aVto help you with repairing the bone.
p192
aVSo we take that periosteum layer
p193
aVand we developed a way to inject underneath it
p194
aVa liquid that then, within 30 seconds,
p195
aVwould turn into quite a rigid gel
p196
aVand can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone.
p197
aVSo it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity
p198
aVthat is right next to both the bone
p199
aVbut also this really rich layer of stem cells.
p200
aVAnd we go in through a pinhole incision
p201
aVso that no other cells from the body can get in,
p202
aVand what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity
p203
aVcan then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells,
p204
aVand they can form lots of new tissue,
p205
aVand then over time, you can harvest that tissue
p206
aVand use it elsewhere in the body.
p207
aa(lp208
VThis is a histology slide
p209
aVof what we see when we do that,
p210
aVand essentially what we see
p211
aVis very large amounts of bone.
p212
aVSo in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg,
p213
aVso the bone marrow,
p214
aVthen you can see the original bone,
p215
aVand you can see where that original bone finishes,
p216
aVand just to the left of that is the new bone
p217
aVthat's grown within that bioreactor cavity,
p218
aVand you can actually make it even larger.
p219
aVAnd that demarcation that you can see
p220
aVbetween the original bone and the new bone
p221
aVacts as a very slight point of weakness,
p222
aVso actually now the surgeon can come along,
p223
aVcan harvest away that new bone,
p224
aVand the periosteum can grow back,
p225
aVso you're left with the leg
p226
aVin the same sort of state
p227
aVas if you hadn't operated on it in the first place.
p228
aVSo it's very, very low in terms of after-pain
p229
aVcompared to an iliac crest harvest.
p230
aVAnd you can grow different amounts of bone
p231
aVdepending on how much gel you put in there,
p232
aVso it really is an on demand sort of procedure.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow, at the time that we did this,
p235
aVthis received a lot of attention in the press,
p236
aVbecause it was a really nice way
p237
aVof generating new bone,
p238
aVand we got many, many contacts
p239
aVfrom different people that  were interested in using this.
p240
aVAnd I'm just going to tell you,
p241
aVsometimes those contacts are very strange,
p242
aVslightly unexpected,
p243
aVand the very most interesting,
p244
aVlet me put it that way, contact that I had,
p245
aVwas actually from a team of American footballers
p246
aVthat all wanted to have double-thickness skulls
p247
aVmade on their head.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd so you do get these kinds of contacts,
p250
aVand of course, being British
p251
aVand also growing up in France,
p252
aVI tend to be very blunt,
p253
aVand so I had to explain to them very nicely
p254
aVthat in their particular case,
p255
aVthere probably wasn't that much in there
p256
aVto protect in the first place.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VSo this was our approach,
p263
aVand it was simple materials,
p264
aVbut we thought about it carefully.
p265
aVAnd actually we know that those cells
p266
aVin the body, in the embryo, as they develop
p267
aVcan form a different kind of tissue, cartilage,
p268
aVand so we developed a gel that was slightly different
p269
aVin nature and slightly different chemistry,
p270
aVput it in there, and we were able to get
p271
aV100 percent cartilage instead.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd this approach works really well, I think,
p274
aVfor pre-planned procedures,
p275
aVbut it's something you do have to pre-plan.
p276
aVSo for other kinds of operations,
p277
aVthere's definitely a need for other
p278
aVscaffold-based approaches.
p279
aVAnd when you think about designing
p280
aVthose other scaffolds, actually,
p281
aVyou need a really multi-disciplinary team.
p282
aVAnd so our team has chemists,
p283
aVit has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even,
p284
aVand those people all come together
p285
aVand we think really hard about  designing the materials.
p286
aa(lp287
VBut we want to make them have enough information
p288
aVthat we can get the cells to do what we want,
p289
aVbut not be so complex as to make it difficult
p290
aVto get to clinic.
p291
aVAnd so one of the things we think about a lot
p292
aVis really trying to understand
p293
aVthe structure of the tissues in the body.
p294
aVAnd so if we think of bone,
p295
aVobviously my own favorite tissue,
p296
aVwe zoom in, we can see,
p297
aVeven if you don't know anything  about bone structure,
p298
aVit's beautifully organized,  really beautifully organized.
p299
aVWe've lots of blood vessels in there.
p300
aVAnd if we zoom in again, we see that the cells
p301
aVare actually surrounded by a 3D matrix
p302
aVof nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot
p303
aVof information to the cells.
p304
aVAnd if we zoom in again,
p305
aVactually in the case of bone, the matrix
p306
aVaround the cells is beautifully organized
p307
aVat the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material
p308
aVthat's part organic, part inorganic.
p309
aVAnd that's led to a whole field, really,
p310
aVthat has looked at developing materials
p311
aVthat have this hybrid kind of structure.
p312
aVAnd so I'm showing here just two examples
p313
aVwhere we've made some materials that have that sort of structure,
p314
aVand you can really tailor it.
p315
aVYou can see here a very squishy one
p316
aVand now a material that's also  this hybrid sort of material
p317
aVbut actually has remarkable toughness,
p318
aVand it's no longer brittle.
p319
aVAnd an inorganic material  would normally be really brittle,
p320
aVand you wouldn't be able to have
p321
aVthat sort of strength and toughness in it.
p322
aa(lp323
VOne other thing I want to quickly mention is that
p324
aVmany of the scaffolds we make  are porous, and they have to be,
p325
aVbecause you want blood vessels to grow in there.
p326
aVBut the pores are actually oftentimes
p327
aVmuch bigger than the cells,
p328
aVand so even though it's 3D,
p329
aVthe cell might see it more  as a slightly curved surface,
p330
aVand that's a little bit unnatural.
p331
aVAnd so one of the things you can think about doing
p332
aVis actually making scaffolds  with slightly different dimensions
p333
aVthat might be able to surround your cells in 3D
p334
aVand give them a little bit more information.
p335
aVAnd there's a lot of work going  on in both of these areas.
p336
aa(lp337
VNow finally, I just want to talk a little bit about
p338
aVapplying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease,
p339
aVbecause this is a really big clinical problem.
p340
aVAnd one of the things that we know is that,
p341
aVunfortunately, if you have a heart attack,
p342
aVthen that tissue can start to die,
p343
aVand your outcome may not be very good over time.
p344
aVAnd it would be really great, actually,
p345
aVif we could stop that dead tissue
p346
aVeither from dying or help it to regenerate.
p347
aVAnd there's lots and lots of stem  cell trials going on worldwide,
p348
aVand they use many different types of cells,
p349
aVbut one common theme that seems to be coming out
p350
aVis that actually, very often, those cells will die
p351
aVonce you've implanted them.
p352
aVAnd you can either put them into the heart
p353
aVor into the blood system,
p354
aVbut either way, we don't seem to be able
p355
aVto get quite the right number of cells
p356
aVgetting to the location we want them to
p357
aVand being able to deliver the sort of beautiful
p358
aVcell regeneration that we would like to have
p359
aVto get good clinical outcomes.
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd so some of the things that we're thinking of,
p362
aVand many other people in the field are thinking of,
p363
aVare actually developing materials for that.
p364
aVBut there's a difference here.
p365
aVWe still need chemistry, we still need mechanics,
p366
aVwe still need really interesting topography,
p367
aVand we still need really interesting  ways to surround the cells.
p368
aVBut now, the cells also
p369
aVwould probably quite like a material
p370
aVthat's going to be able to be conductive,
p371
aVbecause the cells themselves will respond very well
p372
aVand will actually conduct signals  between themselves.
p373
aVYou can see them now
p374
aVbeating synchronously on these materials,
p375
aVand that's a very, very exciting development
p376
aVthat's going on.
p377
aa(lp378
VSo just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that
p379
aVbeing able to work in this sort of field,
p380
aVall of us that work in this field
p381
aVthat's not only super-exciting science,
p382
aVbut also has the potential
p383
aVto impact on patients,
p384
aVhowever big or small they are,
p385
aVis really a great privilege.
p386
aVAnd so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well.
p387
aa(lp388
VThank you.

VI read poetry all the time
p5
aVand write about it frequently
p6
aVand take poems apart
p7
aVto see how they work
p8
aVbecause I'm a word person.
p9
aVI understand the world best, most fully,
p10
aVin words rather than, say, pictures or numbers,
p11
aVand when I have a new experience or a new feeling,
p12
aVI'm a little frustrated
p13
aVuntil I can try to put it into words.
p14
aVI think I've always been that way.
p15
aVI devoured science fiction as a child. I still do.
p16
aVAnd I found poems by Andrew Marvell
p17
aVand Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson
p18
aVand William Butler Yeats
p19
aVbecause they were quoted in science fiction,
p20
aVand I loved their sounds
p21
aVand I went on to read about ottava rima
p22
aVand medial caesuras and enjambment
p23
aVand all that other technical stuff
p24
aVthat you care about if you already care about poems,
p25
aVbecause poems already made me happier
p26
aVand sadder and more alive.
p27
aVAnd I became a poetry critic
p28
aVbecause I wanted to know how and why.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, poetry isn't one thing that serves one purpose
p31
aVany more than music or computer programming
p32
aVserve one purpose.
p33
aVThe greek word poem, it just means "a made thing,"
p34
aVand poetry is a set of techniques,
p35
aVways of making patterns
p36
aVthat put emotions into words.
p37
aVThe more techniques you know,
p38
aVthe more things you can make,
p39
aVand the more patterns you can recognize
p40
aVin things you might already like or love.
p41
aa(lp42
VThat said, poetry does seem to be
p43
aVespecially good at certain things.
p44
aVFor example, we are all going to die.
p45
aVPoetry can help us live with that.
p46
aVPoems are made of words, nothing but words.
p47
aVThe particulars in poems are like
p48
aVthe particularities, the personalities,
p49
aVthat distinguish people from one another.
p50
aVPoems are easy to share, easy to pass on,
p51
aVand when you read a poem, you can imagine
p52
aVsomeone's speaking to you or for you,
p53
aVmaybe even someone far away
p54
aVor someone made up or someone deceased.
p55
aVThat's why we can go to poems when we want to
p56
aVremember something or someone,
p57
aVto celebrate or to look beyond death
p58
aVor to say goodbye,
p59
aVand that's one reason poems can seem important,
p60
aVeven to people who aren't me,
p61
aVwho don't so much live in a world of words.
p62
aVThe poet Frank O'Hara said,
p63
aV"If you don't need poetry, bully for you,"
p64
aVbut he also said when he didn't want to be alive anymore,
p65
aVthe thought that he wouldn't write any more poems
p66
aVhad stopped him.
p67
aVPoetry helps me want to be alive,
p68
aVand I want to show you why by showing you how,
p69
aVhow a couple of poems react to the fact that
p70
aVwe're alive in one place at one time in one culture,
p71
aVand in another we won't be alive at all.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo here's one of the first poems I memorized.
p74
aVIt could address a child or an adult.
p75
aa(lp76
V"From far, from eve and morning
p77
aa(lp78
VFrom yon twelve-winded sky,
p79
aa(lp80
VThe stuff of life to knit me
p81
aa(lp82
VBlew hither; here am I.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow \u2014 for a breath I tarry
p85
aa(lp86
VNor yet disperse apart \u2014
p87
aa(lp88
VTake my hand quick and tell me,
p89
aa(lp90
VWhat have you in your heart.
p91
aa(lp92
VSpeak now, and I will answer;
p93
aa(lp94
VHow shall I help you, say;
p95
aa(lp96
VEre to the wind's twelve quarters
p97
aa(lp98
VI take my endless way."
p99
aa(lp100
V[A. E. Housman]
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, this poem has appealed
p103
aVto science fiction writers.
p104
aVIt's furnished at least three science fiction titles,
p105
aVI think because it says poems can brings us news
p106
aVfrom the future or the past
p107
aVor across the world,
p108
aVbecause their patterns can seem to tell you
p109
aVwhat's in somebody's heart.
p110
aVIt says poems can bring people together temporarily,
p111
aVwhich I think is true,
p112
aVand it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes
p113
aVbut for how it rhymes,
p114
aVcleanly and simply on the two and four,
p115
aV"say" and "way,"
p116
aVwith anticipatory hints on the one and three,
p117
aV"answer" and "quarters,"
p118
aVas if the poem itself were coming together.
p119
aVIt plays up the fact that we die
p120
aVby exaggerating the speed of our lives.
p121
aVA few years on Earth become
p122
aVone speech, one breath.
p123
aVIt's a poem about loneliness \u2014
p124
aVthe "I" in the poem feels no connection will last \u2014
p125
aVand it might look like a plea for help
p126
aV'til you get to the word "help,"
p127
aVwhere this "I" facing you, taking your hand,
p128
aVis more like a teacher or a genie,
p129
aVor at least that's what he wants to believe.
p130
aVIt would not be the first time a poet had
p131
aVwritten the poem that he wanted to hear.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, this next poem really changed
p134
aVwhat I liked and what I read
p135
aVand what I felt I could read as an adult.
p136
aVIt might not make any sense to you
p137
aVif you haven't seen it before.
p138
aa(lp139
V"The Garden"
p140
aa(lp141
V"Oleander: coral
p142
aa(lp143
Vfrom lipstick ads in the 50's.
p144
aa(lp145
VFruit of the tree of such knowledge
p146
aa(lp147
VTo smack (thin air)
p148
aa(lp149
Vmeaning kiss or hit.
p150
aa(lp151
VIt appears
p152
aa(lp153
Vin the guise of outworn usages
p154
aa(lp155
Vbecause we are bad?
p156
aa(lp157
VBig masculine threat,
p158
aa(lp159
Vinsinuating and slangy."
p160
aa(lp161
V[Rae Armantrout]
p162
aa(lp163
VNow, I found this poem in an anthology
p164
aVof almost equally confusing poems in 1989.
p165
aVI just heard that there were these scandalous writers
p166
aVcalled Language poets who didn't make any sense,
p167
aVand I wanted to go and see for myself what they were like,
p168
aVand some of them didn't do much for me,
p169
aVbut this writer, Rae Armantrout,
p170
aVdid an awful lot, and I kept reading her
p171
aVuntil I felt I knew what was going on,
p172
aVas I do with this poem.
p173
aa(lp174
VIt's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall
p175
aVand the Biblical story of the Fall,
p176
aVin which sex as we know it
p177
aVand death and guilt
p178
aVcome into the world at the same time.
p179
aVIt's also about how appearances deceive,
p180
aVhow our culture can sweep us along
p181
aVinto doing and saying things we didn't intend
p182
aVor don't like, and Armantrout's style
p183
aVis trying to help us stop or slow down.
p184
aV"Smack" can mean "kiss" as in air kisses,
p185
aVas in lip-smacking,
p186
aVbut that can lead to "smack" as in "hit"
p187
aVas in domestic abuse,
p188
aVbecause sexual attraction can seem threatening.
p189
aVThe red that means fertility
p190
aVcan also mean poison.
p191
aVOleander is poisonous.
p192
aVAnd outworn usages like "smack" for "kiss"
p193
aVor "hit" can help us see
p194
aVhow our unacknowledged assumptions
p195
aVcan make us believe we are bad,
p196
aVeither because sex is sinful
p197
aVor because we tolerate so much sexism.
p198
aVWe let guys tell women what to do.
p199
aVThe poem reacts to old lipstick ads,
p200
aVand its edginess about statement,
p201
aVits reversals and halts, have everything to do
p202
aVwith resisting the language of ads
p203
aVthat want to tell us so easily what to want,
p204
aVwhat to do, what to think.
p205
aVThat resistance is a lot of the point of the poem,
p206
aVwhich shows me, Armantrout shows me
p207
aVwhat it's like to hear grave threats
p208
aVand mortal dishonesty in the language
p209
aVof everyday life, and once she's done that,
p210
aVI think she can show other people, women and men,
p211
aVwhat it's like to feel that way
p212
aVand say to other people, women and men
p213
aVwho feel so alienated or so threatened
p214
aVthat they're not alone.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, how do I know that I'm right
p217
aVabout this somewhat confusing poem?
p218
aVWell in this case, I emailed the poet a draft of my talk
p219
aVand she said, "Yeah, yeah, that's about it."
p220
aVYeah. (Laughter) (Applause)
p221
aVBut usually, you can't know. You never know.
p222
aVYou can't be sure, and that's okay.
p223
aVAll we can do we is listen to poems
p224
aVand look at poems and guess
p225
aVand see if they can bring us what we need,
p226
aVand if you're wrong about some part of a poem,
p227
aVnothing bad will happen.
p228
aVNow, this next poem is older than Armantrout's,
p229
aVbut a little younger than A. E. Housman's.
p230
aa(lp231
V"The Brave Man"
p232
aa(lp233
V"The sun, that brave man,
p234
aa(lp235
VComes through boughs that lie in wait,
p236
aa(lp237
VThat brave man.
p238
aa(lp239
VGreen and gloomy eyes
p240
aa(lp241
VIn dark forms of the grass
p242
aa(lp243
VRun away.
p244
aa(lp245
VThe good stars,
p246
aa(lp247
VPale helms and spiky spurs,
p248
aa(lp249
VRun away.
p250
aa(lp251
VFears of my bed,
p252
aa(lp253
VFears of life and fears of death,
p254
aa(lp255
VRun away.
p256
aa(lp257
VThat brave man comes up
p258
aa(lp259
VFrom below and walks without meditation,
p260
aa(lp261
VThat brave man."
p262
aa(lp263
V[Wallace Stevens]
p264
aa(lp265
VNow, the sun in this poem,
p266
aVin Wallace Stevens' poem, seems so grave
p267
aVbecause the person in the poem is so afraid.
p268
aVThe sun comes up in the morning through branches,
p269
aVdispels the dew, the eyes, on the grass,
p270
aVand defeats stars envisioned as armies.
p271
aV"Brave" has its old sense of showy
p272
aVas well as its modern sense, courage.
p273
aVThis sun is not afraid to show his face.
p274
aVBut the person in the poem is afraid.
p275
aVHe might have been up all night.
p276
aVThat is the reveal Stevens saves for that fourth stanza,
p277
aVwhere run away has become a refrain.
p278
aVThis person might want to run away too,
p279
aVbut fortified by the sun's example,
p280
aVhe might just rise.
p281
aVStevens saves that sonically odd word "meditation"
p282
aVfor the end.
p283
aVUnlike the sun, human beings think.
p284
aVWe meditate on past and future, life and death,
p285
aVabove and below.
p286
aVAnd it can make us afraid.
p287
aa(lp288
VPoems, the patterns in poems,
p289
aVshow us not just what somebody thought
p290
aVor what someone did or what happened
p291
aVbut what it was like to be a person like that,
p292
aVto be so anxious, so lonely, so inquisitive,
p293
aVso goofy, so preposterous, so brave.
p294
aVThat's why poems can seem at once so durable,
p295
aVso personal, and so ephemeral,
p296
aVlike something inside and outside you at once.
p297
aVThe Scottish poet Denise Riley compares poetry
p298
aVto a needle, a sliver of outside I cradle inside,
p299
aVand the American poet Terrance Hayes
p300
aVwrote six poems called "Wind in a Box."
p301
aVOne of them asks, "Tell me,
p302
aVwhat am I going to do when I'm dead?"
p303
aVAnd the answer is that he'll stay with us
p304
aVor won't stay with us inside us as wind,
p305
aVas air, as words.
p306
aa(lp307
VIt is easier than ever to find poems
p308
aVthat might stay inside you, that might stay with you,
p309
aVfrom long, long ago, or from right this minute,
p310
aVfrom far away or from right close to where you live,
p311
aValmost no matter where you live.
p312
aVPoems can help you say, help you show how you're feeling,
p313
aVbut they can also introduce you
p314
aVto feelings, ways of being in the world,
p315
aVpeople, very much unlike you,
p316
aVmaybe even people from long, long ago.
p317
aVSome poems even tell you
p318
aVthat that is what they can do.
p319
aVThat's what John Keats is doing
p320
aVin his most mysterious, perhaps, poem.
p321
aVIt's mysterious because it's probably unfinished,
p322
aVhe probably left it unfinished,
p323
aVand because it might be meant
p324
aVfor a character in a play,
p325
aVbut it might just be Keats' thinking
p326
aVabout what his own writing,
p327
aVhis handwriting, could do,
p328
aVand in it I hear, at least I hear, mortality,
p329
aVand I hear the power of older poetic techniques,
p330
aVand I have the feeling, you might have the feeling,
p331
aVof meeting even for an instant, almost becoming,
p332
aVsomeone else from long ago,
p333
aVsomeone quite memorable.
p334
aa(lp335
V"This living hand, now warm and capable
p336
aa(lp337
VOf earnest grasping, would, if it were cold
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd in the icy silence of the tomb,
p340
aa(lp341
VSo haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights
p342
aa(lp343
VThat thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood
p344
aa(lp345
VSo in my veins red life might stream again,
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd thou be conscience-calm\u2019d \u2014 see here it is \u2014
p348
aa(lp349
VI hold it towards you."
p350
aa(lp351
VThanks.

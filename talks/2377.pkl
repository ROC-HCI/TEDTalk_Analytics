VThere's something about caves \u2014
p5
aVa shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in.
p6
aVAs you pass through the portal between light and dark,
p7
aVyou enter a subterranean world \u2014
p8
aVa place of perpetual gloom, of earthy smells, of hushed silence.
p9
aa(lp10
VLong ago in Europe,
p11
aVancient people also entered these underground worlds.
p12
aVAs witness to their passage,
p13
aVthey left behind mysterious engravings and paintings,
p14
aVlike this panel of humans, triangles and zigzags from Ojo Guareña in Spain.
p15
aVYou now walk the same path as these early artists.
p16
aVAnd in this surreal, otherworldly place,
p17
aVit's almost possible to imagine
p18
aVthat you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth,
p19
aVor that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend.
p20
aa(lp21
VWhen I'm in a cave,
p22
aVI often find myself wondering what drove these people to go so deep
p23
aVto brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark?
p24
aVIn this video clip,
p25
aVthat was shot half a kilometer, or about a third of a mile, underground,
p26
aVin the cave of Cudon in Spain,
p27
aVwe found a series of red paintings on a ceiling
p28
aVin a previously unexplored section of the cave.
p29
aVAs we crawled forward, military-style, with the ceiling getting ever lower,
p30
aVwe finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low
p31
aVthat my husband and project photographer, Dylan,
p32
aVcould no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DSLR camera.
p33
aVSo while he filmed me,
p34
aVI kept following the trail of red paint with a single light
p35
aVand a point-and-shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion.
p36
aVHalf a kilometer underground.
p37
aa(lp38
VSeriously.
p39
aVWhat was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp?
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VI mean \u2014 me, it makes sense, right?
p44
aa(lp45
VBut you know,
p46
aVthis is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research.
p47
aVI study some of the oldest art in the world.
p48
aVIt was created by these early artists in Europe,
p49
aVbetween 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.
p50
aVAnd the thing is
p51
aVthat I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful,
p52
aVthough some of it certainly is.
p53
aVBut what I'm interested in is the development of the modern mind,
p54
aVof the evolution of creativity, of imagination, of abstract thought,
p55
aVabout what it means to be human.
p56
aVWhile all species communicate in one way or another,
p57
aVonly we humans have really taken it to another level.
p58
aVOur desire and ability to share and collaborate
p59
aVhas been a huge part of our success story.
p60
aVOur modern world is based on a global network of information exchange
p61
aVmade possible, in large part, by our ability to communicate \u2014
p62
aVin particular, using graphic or written forms of communication.
p63
aVThe thing is, though,
p64
aVthat we've been building on the mental achievements
p65
aVof those that came before us for so long
p66
aVthat it's easy to forget that certain abilities haven't already existed.
p67
aVIt's one of the things I find most fascinating
p68
aVabout studying our deep history.
p69
aVThose people didn't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on.
p70
aVThey were the original shoulders.
p71
aVAnd while a surprising number of important inventions
p72
aVcome out of that distant time,
p73
aVwhat I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication.
p74
aa(lp75
VThere are three main types of communication,
p76
aVspoken, gestural \u2014 so things like sign language \u2014
p77
aVand graphic communication.
p78
aVSpoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral.
p79
aVIt requires close contact for a message to be sent and received.
p80
aVAnd after the moment of transmission, it's gone forever.
p81
aVGraphic communication, on the other hand, decouples that relationship.
p82
aVAnd with its invention, it became possible for the first time
p83
aVfor a message to be transmitted and preserved
p84
aVbeyond a single moment in place and time.
p85
aa(lp86
VEurope is one of the first places
p87
aVthat we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing
p88
aVin caves, rock shelters and even a few surviving open-air sites.
p89
aVBut this is not the Europe we know today.
p90
aVThis was a world dominated by towering ice sheets,
p91
aVthree to four kilometers high,
p92
aVwith sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra.
p93
aVThis was the Ice Age.
p94
aa(lp95
VOver the last century,
p96
aVmore than 350 Ice Age rock art sites have been found across the continent,
p97
aVdecorated with animals, abstract shapes and even the occasional human
p98
aVlike these engraved figures from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily.
p99
aVThey provide us with a rare glimpse
p100
aVinto the creative world and imagination of these early artists.
p101
aa(lp102
VSince their discovery,
p103
aVit's been the animals that have received the majority of the study
p104
aVlike this black horse from Cullalvera in Spain,
p105
aVor this unusual purple bison from La Pasiega.
p106
aVBut for me, it was the abstract shapes, what we call geometric signs,
p107
aVthat drew me to study the art.
p108
aVThe funny this is that at most sites
p109
aVthe geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images.
p110
aVBut when I started on this back in 2007,
p111
aVthere wasn't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were,
p112
aVnor was there a strong sense
p113
aVof whether the same ones appeared across space or time.
p114
aVBefore I could even get started on my questions,
p115
aVmy first step was to compile a database
p116
aVof all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites.
p117
aVThe problem was that while they were well documented at some sites,
p118
aVusually the ones with the very nice animals,
p119
aVthere was also a large number of them where it was very vague \u2014
p120
aVthere wasn't a lot of description or detail.
p121
aVSome of them hadn't been visited in half a century or more.
p122
aVThese were the ones that I targeted for my field work.
p123
aa(lp124
VOver the course of two years,
p125
aVmy faithful husband Dylan and I each spent over 300 hours underground,
p126
aVhiking, crawling and wriggling around 52 sites
p127
aVin France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily.
p128
aVAnd it was totally worth it.
p129
aVWe found new, undocumented geometric signs at 75 percent of the sites we visited.
p130
aVThis is the level of accuracy I knew I was going to need
p131
aVif I wanted to start answering those larger questions.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo let's get to those answers.
p134
aVBarring a handful of outliers, there are only 32 geometric signs.
p135
aVOnly 32 signs
p136
aVacross a 30,000-year time span and the entire continent of Europe.
p137
aVThat is a very small number.
p138
aVNow, if these were random doodles or decorations,
p139
aVwe would expect to see a lot more variation,
p140
aVbut instead what we find are the same signs
p141
aVrepeating across both space and time.
p142
aVSome signs start out strong, before losing popularity and vanishing,
p143
aVwhile other signs are later inventions.
p144
aVBut 65 percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period \u2014
p145
aVthings like lines, rectangles triangles, ovals and circles
p146
aVlike we see here from the end of the Ice Age,
p147
aVat a 10,000-year-old site high in the Pyrenees Mountains.
p148
aVAnd while certain signs span thousands of kilometers,
p149
aVother signs had much more restricted distribution patterns,
p150
aVwith some being limited to a single territory,
p151
aVlike we see here with these divided rectangles
p152
aVthat are only found in northern Spain,
p153
aVand which some researchers have speculated
p154
aVcould be some sort of family or clan signs.
p155
aa(lp156
VOn a side note,
p157
aVthere is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art
p158
aVfound all the way from France and Spain to Indonesia and Australia.
p159
aVWith many of the same signs appearing in such far-flung places,
p160
aVespecially in that 30,000 to 40,000-year range,
p161
aVit's starting to seem increasingly likely
p162
aVthat this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in Africa.
p163
aVBut that I'm afraid, is a subject for a future talk.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo back to the matter at hand.
p166
aVThere could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators,
p167
aVlike these 25,000-year-old bas-relief sculptures
p168
aVfrom La Roque de Venasque in France.
p169
aVWe might not know what they meant, but the people of the time certainly did.
p170
aVThe repetition of the same signs, for so long, and at so many sites
p171
aVtells us that the artists were making intentional choices.
p172
aVIf we're talking about geometric shapes,
p173
aVwith specific, culturally recognized, agreed-upon meanings,
p174
aVthan we could very well be looking
p175
aVat one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world.
p176
aa(lp177
VI'm not talking about writing yet.
p178
aVThere's just not enough characters at this point
p179
aVto have represented all of the words in the spoken language,
p180
aVsomething which is a requirement for a full writing system.
p181
aVNor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough
p182
aVto suggest that they were some sort of alphabet.
p183
aVBut what we do have are some intriguing one-offs,
p184
aVlike this panel from La Pasiega in Spain, known as "The Inscription,"
p185
aVwith its symmetrical markings on the left,
p186
aVpossible stylized representations of hands in the middle,
p187
aVand what looks a bit like a bracket on the right.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe oldest systems of graphic communication in the world \u2014
p190
aVSumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, the earliest Chinese script,
p191
aVall emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago,
p192
aVwith each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem
p193
aVmade up of counting marks and pictographic representations,
p194
aVwhere the meaning and the image were the same.
p195
aVSo a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal.
p196
aVIt's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized,
p197
aVuntil they almost become unrecognizable
p198
aVand that we also start to see more symbols being invented
p199
aVto represent all those other missing words in language \u2014
p200
aVthings like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo knowing all this,
p203
aVit seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe
p204
aVwere truly abstract written characters.
p205
aVInstead, what's much more likely
p206
aVis that these early artists were also making counting marks,
p207
aVmaybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily,
p208
aVas well as creating stylized representations
p209
aVof things from the world around them.
p210
aVCould some of the signs be weaponry or housing?
p211
aVOr what about celestial objects like star constellations?
p212
aVOr maybe even rivers, mountains, trees \u2014 landscape features,
p213
aVpossibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs
p214
aVfrom the site of El Castillo in Spain.
p215
aVThe term penniform means "feather-shaped" in Latin,
p216
aVbut could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree?
p217
aVSome researchers have begun to ask these questions
p218
aVabout certain signs at specific sites,
p219
aVbut I believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole.
p220
aVThe irony in all of this, of course,
p221
aVis that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category,
p222
aVI have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart
p223
aVas different types of imagery are identified and separated off.
p224
aa(lp225
VNow don't get me wrong,
p226
aVthe later creation of fully developed writing
p227
aVwas an impressive feat in its own right.
p228
aVBut it's important to remember
p229
aVthat those early writing systems didn't come out of a vacuum.
p230
aVAnd that even 5,000 years ago,
p231
aVpeople were already building on something much older,
p232
aVwith its origins stretching back tens of thousands of years \u2014
p233
aVto the geometric signs of Ice Age Europe and far beyond,
p234
aVto that point, deep in our collective history,
p235
aVwhen someone first came up with the idea of making a graphic mark,
p236
aVand forever changed the nature of how we communicate.
p237
aa(lp238
VThank you.

diverse places as Australia, Africa and North America to make an argument for shamanism having been one of main motivations for creating cave art during the Ice Age in Europe. I like the clear way in which the author lays out the history of the study of rock art and found the book to be an enjoyable read, though I don\'t know if shamanism can really explain all of the art. Just as we find everything from graffiti to religious or purely aesthetic art in our society, it would be reasonable to assume that the same held true during the Ice Age period. With that caveat in place, I would highly recommend this book for the interested layperson."}, {"is_pdf": false, "headline": "Lone Survivors: How We Came to Be the Only Humans on Earth", "link_url": "http://www.amazon.com/Lone-Survivors-Came-Humans-Earth/dp/1250023300/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20", "eyebrow": null, "label": "READ_Book", "note": "Chris Stringer\\r\\nSt. Martin\'s Griffin, 2013", "position": null, "blurb": "If you\'ve ever wondered how we managed to survive the game of evolution roulette while other relatives of ours (like the Neanderthals) didn\'t, or when and how we left Africa, or who we interbred with along the way, then this is the book that will answer these questions in a humorous and accessible way."}, {"is_pdf": false, "headline": "Masters of the Planet: The Search for Our Human Origins", "link_url": "http://www.amazon.com/Masters-Planet-Search-Origins-MacSci/dp/1137278307/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20", "eyebrow": null, "label": "READ_Book", "note": "Ian Tattersall\\r\\nSt. Martin\'s Griffin, 2013", "position": null, "blurb": "Covering several million years of evolution -- everything from ancient human ancestors to recent genome discoveries -- by the time you finish this engaging and easy to understand book, you\'ll have a solid grasp on our own deep history as well as a better understanding of how we know what we know about human evolution.

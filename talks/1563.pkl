VFifteen years ago, it was widely assumed
p5
aVthat the vast majority of brain development
p6
aVtakes place in the first few years of life.
p7
aVBack then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability
p8
aVto look inside the living human brain
p9
aVand track development across the lifespan.
p10
aVIn the past decade or so, mainly due to advances
p11
aVin brain imaging technology
p12
aVsuch as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,
p13
aVneuroscientists have started to look inside the living
p14
aVhuman brain of all ages, and to track changes
p15
aVin brain structure and brain function,
p16
aVso we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot,
p17
aVa photograph, at really high resolution of the inside
p18
aVof the living human brain, and we can ask questions like,
p19
aVhow much gray matter does the brain contain,
p20
aVand how does that change with age?
p21
aVAnd we also use functional MRI, called fMRI,
p22
aVto take a video, a movie, of brain activity
p23
aVwhen participants are taking part in some kind of task
p24
aVlike thinking or feeling or perceiving something.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo many labs around the world are involved in this kind
p27
aVof research, and we now have a really rich
p28
aVand detailed picture of how the living human brain develops,
p29
aVand this picture has radically changed the way
p30
aVwe think about human brain development
p31
aVby revealing that it's not all over in early childhood,
p32
aVand instead, the brain continues to develop
p33
aVright throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts
p36
aVwith the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty
p37
aVand ends at the age at which an individual attains
p38
aVa stable, independent role in society.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVIt can go on a long time. (Laughter)
p41
aVOne of the brain regions that changes most dramatically
p42
aVduring adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.
p43
aVSo this is a model of the human brain,
p44
aVand this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.
p45
aVPrefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.
p46
aVIt's proportionally much bigger in humans than
p47
aVin any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of
p48
aVhigh level cognitive functions, things like decision-making,
p49
aVplanning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow
p50
aVor next week or next year, inhibiting
p51
aVinappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying
p52
aVsomething really rude or doing something really stupid.
p53
aVIt's also involved in social interaction,
p54
aVunderstanding other people, and self-awareness.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo MRI studies looking at the development of this region
p57
aVhave shown that it really undergoes dramatic development
p58
aVduring the period of adolescence.
p59
aVSo if you look at gray matter volume, for example,
p60
aVgray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years
p61
aVincreases during childhood, which is what you can see
p62
aVon this graph. It peaks in early adolescence.
p63
aVThe arrows indicate peak gray matter volume
p64
aVin prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens
p65
aVa couple of years later in boys relative to girls,
p66
aVand that's probably because boys go through puberty
p67
aVa couple of years later than girls on average,
p68
aVand then during adolescence, there's a significant decline
p69
aVin gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex.
p70
aVNow that might sound bad, but actually this is
p71
aVa really important developmental process, because
p72
aVgray matter contains cell bodies and connections
p73
aVbetween cells, the synapses, and this decline
p74
aVin gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex
p75
aVis thought to correspond to synaptic pruning,
p76
aVthe elimination of unwanted synapses.
p77
aVThis is a really important process. It's partly dependent
p78
aVon the environment that the animal or the human is in,
p79
aVand the synapses that are being used are strengthened,
p80
aVand synapses that aren't being used
p81
aVin that particular environment are pruned away.
p82
aVYou can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.
p83
aVYou prune away the weaker branches so that
p84
aVthe remaining, important branches, can grow stronger,
p85
aVand this process, which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue
p86
aVaccording to the species-specific environment,
p87
aVis happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions
p88
aVduring the period of human adolescence.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes
p91
aVin the adolescent brain is using functional MRI
p92
aVto look at changes in brain activity across age.
p93
aVSo I'll just give you an example from my lab.
p94
aVSo in my lab, we're interested in the social brain, that is
p95
aVthe network of brain regions that we use to understand
p96
aVother people and to interact with other people.
p97
aVSo I like to show a photograph of a soccer game
p98
aVto illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.
p99
aVSo this is a soccer game. (Laughter)
p100
aVMichael Owen has just missed a goal, and he's lying
p101
aVon the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain
p102
aVthat this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic
p103
aVand instinctive social emotional responses are,
p104
aVso within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal,
p105
aVeveryone is doing the same thing with their arms
p106
aVand the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen
p107
aVas he slides along the grass, is doing the same thing
p108
aVwith his arms, and presumably has a similar
p109
aVfacial expression, and the only people who don't
p110
aVare the guys in yellow at the back \u2014 (Laughs) \u2014
p111
aVand I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium,
p112
aVand they're doing another social emotional response
p113
aVthat we all instantly recognize, and that's the second aspect
p114
aVof the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates,
p115
aVhow good we are at reading other people's behavior,
p116
aVtheir actions, their gestures, their facial expressions,
p117
aVin terms of their underlying emotions and mental states.
p118
aVSo you don't have to ask any of these guys.
p119
aVYou have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling
p120
aVand thinking at this precise moment in time.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab.
p123
aVSo in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab
p124
aVto have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task
p125
aVthat involves thinking about other people, their minds,
p126
aVtheir mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings
p127
aVthat we've found several times now, as have other labs
p128
aVaround the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called
p129
aVmedial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide,
p130
aVand it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex
p131
aVin the midline of your head.
p132
aVThis region is more active in adolescents when they make
p133
aVthese social decisions and think about other people
p134
aVthan it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis
p135
aVof nine different studies in this area from labs around
p136
aVthe world, and they all show the same thing, that activity
p137
aVin this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases
p138
aVduring the period of adolescence.
p139
aVAnd we think that might be because adolescents and adults
p140
aVuse a different mental approach, a different
p141
aVcognitive strategy, to make social decisions,
p142
aVand one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies
p143
aVwhereby we bring people into the lab and we give them
p144
aVsome kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you
p145
aVanother example of the kind of task that we use in my lab.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo imagine that you're the participant in one of our
p148
aVexperiments. You come into the lab,
p149
aVyou see this computerized task.
p150
aVIn this task, you see a set of shelves.
p151
aVNow, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them,
p152
aVand you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set
p153
aVof shelves, and there are some objects that he can't see.
p154
aVThey're occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of
p155
aVgray piece of wood.
p156
aVThis is the same set of shelves from his point of view.
p157
aVNotice that there are only some objects that he can see,
p158
aVwhereas there are many more objects that you can see.
p159
aVNow your task is to move objects around.
p160
aVThe director, standing behind the set of shelves,
p161
aVis going to direct you to move objects around,
p162
aVbut remember, he's not going to ask you to move objects
p163
aVthat he can't see. This introduces a really interesting
p164
aVcondition whereby there's a kind of conflict
p165
aVbetween your perspective and the director's perspective.
p166
aVSo imagine he tells you to move the top truck left.
p167
aVThere are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively
p168
aVgo for the white truck, because that's the top truck
p169
aVfrom your perspective, but then you have to remember,
p170
aV"Oh, he can't see that truck, so he must mean
p171
aVme to move the blue truck," which is the top truck
p172
aVfrom his perspective. Now believe it or not,
p173
aVnormal, healthy, intelligent adults like you make errors
p174
aVabout 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial.
p175
aVThey move the white truck instead of the blue truck.
p176
aVSo we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults,
p177
aVand we also have a control condition
p178
aVwhere there's no director and instead we give people a rule.
p179
aVWe tell them, okay, we're going to do exactly the same thing
p180
aVbut this time there's no director. Instead you've got to
p181
aVignore objects with the dark gray background.
p182
aVYou'll see that this is exactly the same condition, only
p183
aVin the no-director condition they just have to remember
p184
aVto apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas
p185
aVin the director condition, they have to remember
p186
aVto take into account the director's perspective
p187
aVin order to guide their ongoing behavior.
p188
aa(lp189
VOkay, so if I just show you the percentage errors
p190
aVin a large developmental study we did,
p191
aVthis is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood,
p192
aVand what you're going to see is the percentage errors
p193
aVin the adult group in both conditions,
p194
aVso the gray is the director condition, and you see
p195
aVthat our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent
p196
aVof the time, whereas they make far fewer errors
p197
aVwhen there's no director present, when they just have
p198
aVto remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.
p199
aVDevelopmentally, these two conditions develop
p200
aVin exactly the same way. Between late childhood
p201
aVand mid-adolescence, there's an improvement,
p202
aVin other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials,
p203
aVin both of these conditions.
p204
aVBut it's when you compare the last two groups,
p205
aVthe mid-adolescent group and the adult group
p206
aVwhere things get really interesting, because there, there is
p207
aVno continued improvement in the no-director condition.
p208
aVIn other words, everything you need to do in order to
p209
aVremember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed
p210
aVby mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast,
p211
aVif you look at the last two gray bars, there's still
p212
aVa significant improvement in the director condition
p213
aVbetween mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what
p214
aVthis means is that the ability to take into account someone
p215
aVelse's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior,
p216
aVwhich is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all
p217
aVthe time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence.
p218
aVSo if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you
p219
aVsometimes think they have problems taking other people's
p220
aVperspectives, you're right. They do. And this is why.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo we sometimes laugh about teenagers.
p223
aVThey're parodied, sometimes even demonized in the media
p224
aVfor their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks,
p225
aVthey're sometimes moody, they're very self-conscious.
p226
aVI have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine
p227
aVwho said that the thing he noticed most
p228
aVabout his teenage daughters before and after puberty
p229
aVwas their level of embarrassment in front of him.
p230
aVSo, he said, "Before puberty, if my two daughters
p231
aVwere messing around in a shop, I'd say, 'Hey,
p232
aVstop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song,'
p233
aVand instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing
p234
aVtheir favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat.
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVThe very notion of their dad singing in public
p237
aVwas enough to make them behave.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo people often ask,
p240
aV"Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?
p241
aVIs it something we've invented recently in the West?"
p242
aVAnd actually, the answer is probably not. There are lots
p243
aVof descriptions of adolescence in history that sound
p244
aVvery similar to the descriptions we use today.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from "The Winter's Tale"
p247
aVwhere he describes adolescence as follows:
p248
aV"I would there were no age between ten and
p249
aVthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest;
p250
aVfor there is nothing in the between but getting wenches
p251
aVwith child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting." (Laughter)
p252
aVHe then goes on to say, "Having said that, would any
p253
aVbut these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
p254
aVhunt in this weather?" (Laughter)
p255
aVSo almost 400 years ago, Shakespeare was portraying
p256
aVadolescents in a very similar light to the light that we
p257
aVportray them in today, but today we try to understand
p258
aVtheir behavior in terms of the underlying changes
p259
aVthat are going on in their brain.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents
p262
aVhave a tendency to take risks. They do.
p263
aVThey take more risks than children or adults,
p264
aVand they are particularly prone to taking risks
p265
aVwhen they're with their friends. There's an important drive
p266
aVto become independent from one's parents
p267
aVand to impress one's friends in adolescence.
p268
aVBut now we try to understand that in terms of
p269
aVthe development of a part of their brain called the limbic system,
p270
aVso I'm going to show you the limbic system in red
p271
aVin the slide behind me, and also on this brain.
p272
aVSo the limbic system is right deep inside the brain,
p273
aVand it's involved in things like emotion processing
p274
aVand reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling
p275
aVout of doing fun things, including taking risks.
p276
aVIt gives you the kick out of taking risks.
p277
aVAnd this region, the regions within the limbic system,
p278
aVhave been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding
p279
aVfeeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults,
p280
aVand at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex,
p281
aVwhich you can see in blue in the slide here,
p282
aVwhich stops us taking excessive risks,
p283
aVis still very much in development in adolescents.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo brain research has shown that the adolescent brain
p286
aVundergoes really quite profound development,
p287
aVand this has implications for education, for rehabilitation,
p288
aVand intervention. The environment, including teaching,
p289
aVcan and does shape the developing adolescent brain,
p290
aVand yet it's only relatively recently that we have been
p291
aVroutinely educating teenagers in the West.
p292
aVAll four of my grandparents, for example, left school
p293
aVin their early adolescence. They had no choice.
p294
aVAnd that's still the case for many, many teenagers
p295
aVaround the world today. Forty percent of teenagers
p296
aVdon't have access to secondary school education.
p297
aVAnd yet, this is a period of life where the brain is
p298
aVparticularly adaptable and malleable.
p299
aVIt's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo what's sometimes seen as the problem
p302
aVwith adolescents \u2014 heightened risk-taking, poor impulse
p303
aVcontrol, self-consciousness \u2014 shouldn't be stigmatized.
p304
aVIt actually reflects changes in the brain that provide
p305
aVan excellent opportunity for education
p306
aVand social development. Thank you. (Applause)

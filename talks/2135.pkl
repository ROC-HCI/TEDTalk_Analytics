VPicture this:
p5
aVIt's Monday morning,
p6
aVyou're at the office,
p7
aVyou're settling in for the day at work,
p8
aVand this guy that you sort of  recognize from down the hall,
p9
aVwalks right into your cubicle
p10
aVand he steals your chair.
p11
aVDoesn't say a word \u2014
p12
aVjust rolls away with it.
p13
aVDoesn't give you any information about why he took your chair
p14
aVout of all the other chairs  that are out there.
p15
aVDoesn't acknowledge the fact  that you might need your chair
p16
aVto get some work done today.
p17
aVYou wouldn't stand for  it. You'd make a stink.
p18
aVYou'd follow that guy back to his cubicle
p19
aVand you'd say, "Why my chair?"
p20
aa(lp21
VOkay, so now it's Tuesday morning and you're at the office,
p22
aVand a meeting invitation pops  up in your calendar.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVAnd it's from this woman who you  kind of know from down the hall,
p25
aVand the subject line references some  project that you heard a little bit about.
p26
aVBut there's no agenda.
p27
aVThere's no information about why you were invited to the meeting.
p28
aVAnd yet you accept the  meeting invitation, and you go.
p29
aVAnd when this highly  unproductive session is over,
p30
aVyou go back to your desk,
p31
aVand you stand at your  desk and you say,
p32
aV"Boy, I wish I had those two hours back,
p33
aVlike I wish I had my chair back."
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VEvery day, we allow our coworkers,
p37
aVwho are otherwise very,  very nice people,
p38
aVto steal from us.
p39
aVAnd I'm talking about something far  more valuable than office furniture.
p40
aVI'm talking about time. Your time.
p41
aVIn fact, I believe that
p42
aVwe are in the middle of a global epidemic
p43
aVof a terrible new illness known as MAS:
p44
aVMindless Accept Syndrome.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVThe primary symptom of  Mindless Accept Syndrome
p47
aVis just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVIt's an involuntary reflex \u2014 ding,  click, bing \u2014 it's in your calendar,
p50
aV"Gotta go, I'm already late  for a meeting." (Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VMeetings are important, right?
p53
aVAnd collaboration is key to  the success of any enterprise.
p54
aVAnd a well-run meeting can yield  really positive, actionable results.
p55
aVBut between globalization
p56
aVand pervasive information technology,
p57
aVthe way that we work
p58
aVhas really changed dramatically  over the last few years.
p59
aVAnd we're miserable. (Laughter)
p60
aVAnd we're miserable not because the  other guy can't run a good meeting,
p61
aVit's because of MAS, our  Mindless Accept Syndrome,
p62
aVwhich is a self-inflicted wound.
p63
aa(lp64
VActually, I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic.
p65
aVLet me tell you why.
p66
aVA couple of years ago, I put a video  on Youtube, and in the video,
p67
aVI acted out every terrible  conference call you've ever been on.
p68
aVIt goes on for about five minutes,
p69
aVand it has all the things that we  hate about really bad meetings.
p70
aVThere's the moderator who has  no idea how to run the meeting.
p71
aVThere are the participants who  have no idea why they're there.
p72
aVThe whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck.
p73
aVAnd everybody leaves very angry.
p74
aVIt's kind of funny.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVLet's take a quick look.
p77
aV(Video) Our goal today is to come to an  agreement on a very important proposal.
p78
aVAs a group, we need to decide if \u2014
p79
aVbloop bloop \u2014
p80
aVHi, who just joined?
p81
aVHi, it's Joe. I'm working from home today.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVHi, Joe. Thanks for  joining us today, great.
p84
aVI was just saying, we have a lot of people  on the call we'd like to get through,
p85
aVso let's skip the roll call
p86
aVand I'm gonna dive right in.
p87
aVOur goal today is to come to an  agreement on a very important proposal.
p88
aVAs a group, we need to decide if \u2014
p89
aVbloop bloop \u2014
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVHi, who just joined?
p92
aVNo? I thought I heard a beep. (Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VSound familiar?
p95
aVYeah, it sounds familiar  to me, too.
p96
aVA couple of weeks after I put that online,
p97
aV500,000 people in dozens of countries,
p98
aVI mean dozens of countries,
p99
aVwatched this video.
p100
aVAnd three years later, it's still getting  thousands of views every month.
p101
aVIt's close to about a million right now.
p102
aVAnd in fact, some of the biggest companies in the world,
p103
aVcompanies that you've  heard of but I won't name,
p104
aVhave asked for my permission to use  this video in their new-hire training
p105
aVto teach their new employees how  not to run a meeting at their company.
p106
aVAnd if the numbers \u2014
p107
aVthere are a million views and it's being used by all these companies \u2014
p108
aVaren't enough proof that we have  a global problem with meetings,
p109
aVthere are the many, many thousands
p110
aVof comments posted online
p111
aVafter the video went up.
p112
aVThousands of people wrote things like,
p113
aV"OMG, that was my day today!"
p114
aV"That was my day every day!"
p115
aV"This is my life."
p116
aVOne guy wrote,
p117
aV"It's funny because it's true.
p118
aVEerily, sadly, depressingly true.
p119
aVIt made me laugh until I cried.
p120
aVAnd cried. And I cried some more."
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVThis poor guy said,
p123
aV"My daily life until  retirement or death, sigh."
p124
aVThese are real quotes
p125
aVand it's real sad.
p126
aa(lp127
VA common theme running through all of these comments online
p128
aVis this fundamental belief  that we are powerless
p129
aVto do anything other  than go to meetings
p130
aVand suffer through these  poorly run meetings
p131
aVand live to meet another day.
p132
aVBut the truth is, we're  not powerless at all.
p133
aVIn fact, the cure for MAS is right here in our hands.
p134
aVIt's right at our fingertips, literally.
p135
aVIt's something that I call ¡No MAS!
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVWhich, if I remember my  high school Spanish,
p138
aVmeans something like,  "Enough already, make it stop!"
p139
aa(lp140
VHere's how No MAS  works. It's very simple.
p141
aVFirst of all, the next time you  get a meeting invitation
p142
aVthat doesn't have a lot  of information in it at all,
p143
aVclick the tentative button!
p144
aVIt's okay, you're allowed,  that's why it's there.
p145
aVIt's right next to the accept button.
p146
aVOr the maybe button, or whatever button  is there for you not to accept immediately.
p147
aVThen, get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting.
p148
aVTell them you're very excited  to support their work,
p149
aVask them what the goal  of the meeting is,
p150
aVand tell them you're interested in learning  how you can help them achieve their goal.
p151
aVAnd if we do this often enough,
p152
aVand we do it respectfully,
p153
aVpeople might start to be  a little bit more thoughtful
p154
aVabout the way they put together meeting invitations.
p155
aVAnd you can make more thoughtful  decisions about accepting it.
p156
aVPeople might actually start  sending out agendas. Imagine!
p157
aVOr they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status
p158
aVwhen they could just do a quick email and get it done with.
p159
aVPeople just might start to change their  behavior because you changed yours.
p160
aVAnd they just might bring your chair back, too. (Laughter)
p161
aVNo MAS!
p162
aVThank you.
p163
aV(Applause).

VOne day in 1819,
p5
aV3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,
p6
aVin one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean,
p7
aV20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.
p8
aVThey'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped
p9
aVa catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.
p10
aVAs their ship began to sink beneath the swells,
p11
aVthe men huddled together in three small whaleboats.
p12
aVThese men were 10,000 miles from home,
p13
aVmore than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.
p14
aVIn their small boats, they carried only
p15
aVrudimentary navigational equipment
p16
aVand limited supplies of food and water.
p17
aVThese were the men of the whaleship Essex,
p18
aVwhose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."
p19
aa(lp20
VEven in today's world, their situation would be really dire,
p21
aVbut think about how much worse it would have been then.
p22
aVNo one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.
p23
aVNo search party was coming to look for these men.
p24
aVSo most of us have never experienced a situation
p25
aVas frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,
p26
aVbut we all know what it's like to be afraid.
p27
aVWe know how fear feels,
p28
aVbut I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about
p29
aVwhat our fears mean.
p30
aa(lp31
VAs we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear
p32
aVas a weakness, just another childish thing to discard
p33
aVlike baby teeth or roller skates.
p34
aVAnd I think it's no accident that we think this way.
p35
aVNeuroscientists have actually shown that human beings
p36
aVare hard-wired to be optimists.
p37
aVSo maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,
p38
aVas a danger in and of itself.
p39
aV"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."
p40
aVIn English, fear is something we conquer.
p41
aVIt's something we fight. It's something we overcome.
p42
aVBut what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?
p43
aVWhat if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,
p44
aVsomething that can be as profound and insightful
p45
aVas storytelling itself?
p46
aa(lp47
VIt's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination
p48
aVin young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.
p49
aVWhen I was a child, I lived in California,
p50
aVwhich is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,
p51
aVbut for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.
p52
aVI remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier
p53
aVthat hung above our dining table swing back and forth
p54
aVduring every minor earthquake,
p55
aVand I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified
p56
aVthat the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.
p57
aVAnd what we say about kids who have fears like that
p58
aVis that they have a vivid imagination.
p59
aVBut at a certain point, most of us learn
p60
aVto leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.
p61
aVWe learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,
p62
aVand not every earthquake brings buildings down.
p63
aVBut maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds
p64
aVfail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.
p65
aVThe same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species,"
p66
aV"Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"
p67
aValso generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives
p68
aVof Charles Darwin, Charlotte Bront\u0102\u0164 and Marcel Proust.
p69
aVSo the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear
p70
aVfrom visionaries and young children?
p71
aa(lp72
VWell let's return to the year 1819 for a moment,
p73
aVto the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.
p74
aVLet's take a look at the fears that their imaginations
p75
aVwere generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.
p76
aVTwenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.
p77
aVThe time had come for the men to make a plan,
p78
aVbut they had very few options.
p79
aVIn his fascinating account of the disaster,
p80
aVNathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about
p81
aVas far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.
p82
aVThe men knew that the nearest islands they could reach
p83
aVwere the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.
p84
aVBut they'd heard some frightening rumors.
p85
aVThey'd been told that these islands,
p86
aVand several others nearby, were populated by cannibals.
p87
aVSo the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered
p88
aVand eaten for dinner.
p89
aVAnother possible destination was Hawaii,
p90
aVbut given the season, the captain was afraid
p91
aVthey'd be struck by severe storms.
p92
aVNow the last option was the longest, and the most difficult:
p93
aVto sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching
p94
aVa certain band of winds that could eventually
p95
aVpush them toward the coast of South America.
p96
aVBut they knew that the sheer length of this journey
p97
aVwould stretch their supplies of food and water.
p98
aVTo be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms,
p99
aVto starve to death before reaching land.
p100
aVThese were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men,
p101
aVand as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to
p102
aVwould govern whether they lived or died.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.
p105
aVWhat if instead of calling them fears,
p106
aVwe called them stories?
p107
aVBecause that's really what fear is, if you think about it.
p108
aVIt's a kind of unintentional storytelling
p109
aVthat we are all born knowing how to do.
p110
aVAnd fears and storytelling have the same components.
p111
aVThey have the same architecture.
p112
aVLike all stories, fears have characters.
p113
aVIn our fears, the characters are us.
p114
aVFears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.
p115
aVYou board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.
p116
aVOur fears also tend to contain imagery that can be
p117
aVevery bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.
p118
aVPicture a cannibal, human teeth
p119
aVsinking into human skin,
p120
aVhuman flesh roasting over a fire.
p121
aVFears also have suspense.
p122
aVIf I've done my job as a storyteller today,
p123
aVyou should be wondering what happened
p124
aVto the men of the whaleship Essex.
p125
aVOur fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.
p126
aVJust like all great stories, our fears focus our attention
p127
aVon a question that is as important in life as it is in literature:
p128
aVWhat will happen next?
p129
aVIn other words, our fears make us think about the future.
p130
aVAnd humans, by the way, are the only creatures capable
p131
aVof thinking about the future in this way,
p132
aVof projecting ourselves forward in time,
p133
aVand this mental time travel is just one more thing
p134
aVthat fears have in common with storytelling.
p135
aa(lp136
VAs a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction
p137
aVis learning to predict how one event in a story
p138
aVwill affect all the other events,
p139
aVand fear works in that same way.
p140
aVIn fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.
p141
aVWhen I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles,"
p142
aVI spent months trying to figure out what would happen
p143
aVif the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.
p144
aVWhat would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?
p145
aVWhat would happen to our minds?
p146
aVAnd then it was only later that I realized how very similar
p147
aVthese questions were to the ones I used to ask myself
p148
aVas a child frightened in the night.
p149
aVIf an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,
p150
aVwhat will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?
p151
aVAnd the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.
p152
aVSo if we think of our fears as more than just fears
p153
aVbut as stories, we should think of ourselves
p154
aVas the authors of those stories.
p155
aVBut just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves
p156
aVas the readers of our fears, and how we choose
p157
aVto read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.
p160
aVI read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,
p161
aVand the author found that these people shared a habit
p162
aVthat he called "productive paranoia," which meant that
p163
aVthese people, instead of dismissing their fears,
p164
aVthese people read them closely, they studied them,
p165
aVand then they translated that fear into preparation and action.
p166
aVSo that way, if their worst fears came true,
p167
aVtheir businesses were ready.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.
p170
aVThat's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.
p171
aVOnce in a while, our fears can predict the future.
p172
aVBut we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears
p173
aVthat our imaginations concoct.
p174
aVSo how can we tell the difference between
p175
aVthe fears worth listening to and all the others?
p176
aVI think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex
p177
aVoffers an illuminating, if tragic, example.
p178
aVAfter much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.
p179
aVTerrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands
p180
aVand instead embarked on the longer
p181
aVand much more difficult route to South America.
p182
aVAfter more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food
p183
aVas they knew they might,
p184
aVand they were still quite far from land.
p185
aVWhen the last of the survivors were finally picked up
p186
aVby two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive,
p187
aVand some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.
p188
aVHerman Melville, who used this story as research for "Moby Dick,"
p189
aVwrote years later, and from dry land, quote,
p190
aV"All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex
p191
aVmight in all human probability have been avoided
p192
aVhad they, immediately after leaving the wreck,
p193
aVsteered straight for Tahiti.
p194
aVBut," as Melville put it, "they dreaded cannibals."
p195
aVSo the question is, why did these men dread cannibals
p196
aVso much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation?
p197
aVWhy were they swayed by one story
p198
aVso much more than the other?
p199
aVLooked at from this angle,
p200
aVtheirs becomes a story about reading.
p201
aVThe novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader
p202
aVhas a combination of two very different temperaments,
p203
aVthe artistic and the scientific.
p204
aVA good reader has an artist's passion,
p205
aVa willingness to get caught up in the story,
p206
aVbut just as importantly, the readers also needs
p207
aVthe coolness of judgment of a scientist,
p208
aVwhich acts to temper and complicate
p209
aVthe reader's intuitive reactions to the story.
p210
aVAs we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.
p211
aVThey dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.
p212
aVThe problem was that they listened to the wrong story.
p213
aVOf all the narratives their fears wrote,
p214
aVthey responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid,
p215
aVthe one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture:
p216
aVcannibals.
p217
aVBut perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears
p218
aVmore like a scientist, with more coolness of judgment,
p219
aVthey would have listened instead to the less violent
p220
aVbut the more likely tale, the story of starvation,
p221
aVand headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd maybe if we all tried to read our fears,
p224
aVwe too would be less often swayed
p225
aVby the most salacious among them.
p226
aVMaybe then we'd spend less time worrying about
p227
aVserial killers and plane crashes,
p228
aVand more time concerned with the subtler
p229
aVand slower disasters we face:
p230
aVthe silent buildup of plaque in our arteries,
p231
aVthe gradual changes in our climate.
p232
aVJust as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest,
p233
aVso too might our subtlest fears be the truest.
p234
aVRead in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift
p235
aVof the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance,
p236
aVa way of glimpsing what might be the future
p237
aVwhen there's still time to influence how that future will play out.
p238
aVProperly read, our fears can offer us something as precious
p239
aVas our favorite works of literature:
p240
aVa little wisdom, a bit of insight
p241
aVand a version of that most elusive thing \u2014
p242
aVthe truth.
p243
aVThank you. (Applause)

VThis story
p5
aVis about taking imagination seriously.
p6
aVFourteen years ago,
p7
aVI first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet,
p8
aVused the same way for centuries.
p9
aVToday, I'm using it to create
p10
aVpermanent, billowing, voluptuous forms
p11
aVthe scale of hard-edged buildings
p12
aVin cities around the world.
p13
aVI was an unlikely person to be doing this.
p14
aVI never studied sculpture,
p15
aVengineering or architecture.
p16
aVIn fact, after college
p17
aVI applied to seven art schools
p18
aVand was rejected by all seven.
p19
aa(lp20
VI went off on my own to become an artist,
p21
aVand I painted for 10 years,
p22
aVwhen I was offered a Fulbright to India.
p23
aVPromising to give exhibitions of paintings,
p24
aVI shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.
p25
aVThe deadline for the show arrived \u2014
p26
aVmy paints didn't.
p27
aVI had to do something.
p28
aVThis fishing village was famous for sculpture.
p29
aVSo I tried bronze casting.
p30
aVBut to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.
p31
aVI went for a walk on the beach,
p32
aVwatching the fishermen
p33
aVbundle their nets into mounds on the sand.
p34
aVI'd seen it every day,
p35
aVbut this time I saw it differently \u2014
p36
aVa new approach to sculpture,
p37
aVa way to make volumetric form
p38
aVwithout heavy solid materials.
p39
aa(lp40
VMy first satisfying sculpture
p41
aVwas made in collaboration with these fishermen.
p42
aVIt's a self-portrait
p43
aVtitled "Wide Hips."
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVWe hoisted them on poles to photograph.
p46
aVI discovered
p47
aVtheir soft surfaces
p48
aVrevealed every ripple of wind
p49
aVin constantly changing patterns.
p50
aVI was mesmerized.
p51
aVI continued studying craft traditions
p52
aVand collaborating with artisans,
p53
aVnext in Lithuania with lace makers.
p54
aVI liked the fine detail
p55
aVit gave my work,
p56
aVbut I wanted to make them larger \u2014
p57
aVto shift from being an object you look at
p58
aVto something you could get lost in.
p59
aa(lp60
VReturning to India to work with those fishermen,
p61
aVwe made a net
p62
aVof a million and a half hand-tied knots \u2014
p63
aVinstalled briefly in Madrid.
p64
aVThousands of people saw it,
p65
aVand one of them was the urbanist
p66
aVManual Sola-Morales
p67
aVwho was redesigning the waterfront
p68
aVin Porto, Portugal.
p69
aVHe asked if I could build this
p70
aVas a permanent piece for the city.
p71
aVI didn't know if I could do that
p72
aVand preserve my art.
p73
aVDurable, engineered, permanent \u2014
p74
aVthose are in opposition
p75
aVto idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.
p76
aa(lp77
VFor two years, I searched for a fiber
p78
aVthat could survive ultraviolet rays,
p79
aVsalt, air, pollution,
p80
aVand at the same time remain soft enough
p81
aVto move fluidly in the wind.
p82
aVWe needed something to hold the net up
p83
aVout there in the middle of the traffic circle.
p84
aVSo we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.
p85
aVWe had to engineer it
p86
aVto move gracefully in an average breeze
p87
aVand survive in hurricane winds.
p88
aVBut there was no engineering software
p89
aVto model something porous and moving.
p90
aVI found a brilliant aeronautical engineer
p91
aVwho designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts
p92
aVnamed Peter Heppel.
p93
aVHe helped me tackle the twin challenges
p94
aVof precise shape
p95
aVand gentle movement.
p96
aa(lp97
VI couldn't build this the way I knew
p98
aVbecause hand-tied knots
p99
aVweren't going to withstand a hurricane.
p100
aVSo I developed a relationship
p101
aVwith an industrial fishnet factory,
p102
aVlearned the variables of their machines,
p103
aVand figured out a way
p104
aVto make lace with them.
p105
aVThere was no language
p106
aVto translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft
p107
aVinto something machine operators could produce.
p108
aVSo we had to create one.
p109
aVThree years and two children later,
p110
aVwe raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.
p111
aVIt was hard to believe
p112
aVthat what I had imagined
p113
aVwas now built, permanent
p114
aVand had lost nothing in translation.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VThis intersection had been bland and anonymous.
p119
aVNow it had a sense of place.
p120
aVI walked underneath it
p121
aVfor the first time.
p122
aVAs I watched the wind's choreography unfold,
p123
aVI felt sheltered
p124
aVand, at the same time,
p125
aVconnected to limitless sky.
p126
aVMy life was not going to be the same.
p127
aVI want to create these oases of sculpture
p128
aVin spaces of cities around the world.
p129
aVI'm going to share two directions
p130
aVthat are new in my work.
p131
aa(lp132
VHistoric Philadelphia City Hall:
p133
aVits plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture
p134
aVthat was lighter than netting.
p135
aVSo we experimented
p136
aVwith tiny atomized water particles
p137
aVto create a dry mist
p138
aVthat is shaped by the wind
p139
aVand in testing, discovered
p140
aVthat it can be shaped by people
p141
aVwho can interact and move through it without getting wet.
p142
aVI'm using this sculpture material
p143
aVto trace the paths of subway trains above ground
p144
aVin real time \u2014
p145
aVlike an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.
p146
aa(lp147
VNext challenge,
p148
aVthe Biennial of the Americas in Denver
p149
aVasked, could I represent
p150
aVthe 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness
p151
aVin a sculpture?
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVI didn't know where to begin,
p154
aVbut I said yes.
p155
aVI read about the recent earthquake in Chile
p156
aVand the tsunami that rippled across
p157
aVthe entire Pacific Ocean.
p158
aVIt shifted the Earth's tectonic plates,
p159
aVsped up the planet's rotation
p160
aVand literally shortened the length of the day.
p161
aVSo I contacted NOAA,
p162
aVand I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami,
p163
aVand translated it into this.
p164
aVIts title: "1.26"
p165
aVrefers to the number of microseconds
p166
aVthat the Earth's day was shortened.
p167
aa(lp168
VI couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.
p169
aVIts shape was too complex now.
p170
aVSo I replaced the metal armature
p171
aVwith a soft, fine mesh
p172
aVof a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.
p173
aVThe sculpture could now be entirely soft,
p174
aVwhich made it so light
p175
aVit could tie in to existing buildings \u2014
p176
aVliterally becoming part of the fabric of the city.
p177
aVThere was no software
p178
aVthat could extrude these complex net forms
p179
aVand model them with gravity.
p180
aVSo we had to create it.
p181
aa(lp182
VThen I got a call from New York City
p183
aVasking if I could adapt these concepts
p184
aVto Times Square
p185
aVor the High Line.
p186
aVThis new soft structural method
p187
aVenables me to model these
p188
aVand build these sculptures
p189
aVat the scale of skyscrapers.
p190
aVThey don't have funding yet,
p191
aVbut I dream now
p192
aVof bringing these to cities around the world
p193
aVwhere they're most needed.
p194
aa(lp195
VFourteen years ago,
p196
aVI searched for beauty
p197
aVin the traditional things,
p198
aVin craft forms.
p199
aVNow I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering
p200
aVto create voluptuous, billowing forms
p201
aVthe scale of buildings.
p202
aVMy artistic horizons continue to grow.
p203
aa(lp204
VI'll leave you with this story.
p205
aVI got a call from a friend in Phoenix.
p206
aVAn attorney in the office
p207
aVwho'd never been interested in art,
p208
aVnever visited the local art museum,
p209
aVdragged everyone she could from the building
p210
aVand got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.
p211
aVThere they were in their business suits,
p212
aVlaying in the grass,
p213
aVnoticing the changing patterns of wind
p214
aVbeside people they didn't know,
p215
aVsharing the rediscovery of wonder.
p216
aa(lp217
VThank you.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VThank you. Thank you.
p222
aVThank you.
p223
aVThank you. Thank you.

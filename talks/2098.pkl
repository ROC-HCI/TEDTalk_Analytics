VI want to tell you
p5
aVhow 20,000 remarkable young people
p6
aVfrom over 100 countries
p7
aVended up in Cuba
p8
aVand are transforming health in their communities.
p9
aVNinety percent of them would never
p10
aVhave left home at all
p11
aVif it weren't for a scholarship to study medicine in Cuba
p12
aVand a commitment to go back
p13
aVto places like the ones they'd come from \u2014
p14
aVremote farmlands, mountains, ghettos \u2014
p15
aVto become doctors for people like themselves,
p16
aVto walk the walk.
p17
aa(lp18
VHavana's Latin American Medical School:
p19
aVIt's the largest medical school in the world,
p20
aVgraduating 23,000 young doctors
p21
aVsince its first class of 2005,
p22
aVwith nearly 10,000 more in the pipeline.
p23
aVIts mission, to train physicians for the people
p24
aVwho need them the most:
p25
aVthe over one billion
p26
aVwho have never seen a doctor,
p27
aVthe people who live and die
p28
aVunder every poverty line ever invented.
p29
aVIts students defy all norms.
p30
aVThey're the school's biggest risk
p31
aVand also its best bet.
p32
aVThey're recruited from the poorest,
p33
aVmost broken places on our planet
p34
aVby a school that believes they can become
p35
aVnot just the good
p36
aVbut the excellent physicians
p37
aVtheir communities desperately need,
p38
aVthat they will practice where most doctors don't,
p39
aVin places not only poor
p40
aVbut oftentimes dangerous,
p41
aVcarrying venom antidotes in their backpacks
p42
aVor navigating neighborhoods
p43
aVriddled by drugs, gangs and bullets,
p44
aVtheir home ground.
p45
aVThe hope is that they will help
p46
aVtransform access to care,
p47
aVthe health picture in impoverished areas,
p48
aVand even the way medicine itself
p49
aVis learned and practiced,
p50
aVand that they will become pioneers in our global reach
p51
aVfor universal health coverage,
p52
aVsurely a tall order.
p53
aVTwo big storms and this notion of "walk the walk"
p54
aVprompted creation of ELAM back in 1998.
p55
aVThe Hurricanes Georges and Mitch
p56
aVhad ripped through the Caribbean
p57
aVand Central America,
p58
aVleaving 30,000 dead
p59
aVand two and a half million homeless.
p60
aVHundreds of Cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response,
p61
aVbut when they got there,
p62
aVthey found a bigger disaster:
p63
aVwhole communities with no healthcare,
p64
aVdoors bolted shut on rural hospitals
p65
aVfor lack of staff,
p66
aVand just too many babies dying
p67
aVbefore their first birthday.
p68
aVWhat would happen when these Cuban doctors left?
p69
aVNew doctors were needed to make care sustainable,
p70
aVbut where would they come from?
p71
aVWhere would they train?
p72
aa(lp73
VIn Havana, the campus of a former naval academy
p74
aVwas turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry
p75
aVto become the Latin American Medical School,
p76
aVELAM.
p77
aVTuition, room and board, and a small stipend
p78
aVwere offered to hundreds of students
p79
aVfrom the countries hardest hit by the storms.
p80
aVAs a journalist in Havana,
p81
aVI watched the first 97 Nicaraguans arrive
p82
aVin March 1999,
p83
aVsettling into dorms barely refurbished
p84
aVand helping their professors not only sweep out the classrooms
p85
aVbut move in the desks and the chairs and the microscopes.
p86
aVOver the next few years,
p87
aVgovernments throughout the Americas
p88
aVrequested scholarships for their own students,
p89
aVand the Congressional Black Caucus
p90
aVasked for and received hundreds of scholarships
p91
aVfor young people from the USA.
p92
aVToday, among the 23,000
p93
aVare graduates from 83 countries
p94
aVin the Americas, Africa and Asia,
p95
aVand enrollment has grown to 123 nations.
p96
aVMore than half the students are young women.
p97
aVThey come from 100 ethnic groups,
p98
aVspeak 50 different languages.
p99
aVWHO Director Margaret Chan said,
p100
aV"For once, if you are poor, female,
p101
aVor from an indigenous population,
p102
aVyou have a distinct advantage,
p103
aVan ethic that makes this medical school unique."
p104
aa(lp105
VLuther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho
p106
aVon the Atlantic coast of Honduras.
p107
aVThere's no running water,
p108
aVno electricity there,
p109
aVand to reach the village, you have to walk for hours
p110
aVor take your chances in a pickup truck like I did
p111
aVskirting the waves of the Atlantic.
p112
aVLuther was one of 40 Tocamacho children
p113
aVwho started grammar school,
p114
aVthe sons and daughters of a black indigenous people
p115
aVknown as the Garífuna,
p116
aV20 percent of the Honduran population.
p117
aVThe nearest healthcare was fatal miles away.
p118
aVLuther had to walk three hours every day
p119
aVto middle school.
p120
aVOnly 17 made that trip.
p121
aVOnly five went on to high school,
p122
aVand only one to university:
p123
aVLuther, to ELAM,
p124
aVamong the first crop of Garífuna graduates.
p125
aVJust two Garífuna doctors had preceded them
p126
aVin all of Honduran history.
p127
aVNow there are 69, thanks to ELAM.
p128
aa(lp129
VBig problems need big solutions,
p130
aVsparked by big ideas, imagination and audacity,
p131
aVbut also solutions that work.
p132
aVELAM's faculty had no handy evidence base
p133
aVto guide them, so they learned the hard way,
p134
aVby doing and correcting course as they went.
p135
aVEven the brightest students
p136
aVfrom these poor communities
p137
aVweren't academically prepared
p138
aVfor six years of medical training,
p139
aVso a bridging course was set up in sciences.
p140
aVThen came language:
p141
aVthese were Mapuche, Quechuas, Guaraní, Garífuna,
p142
aVindigenous peoples
p143
aVwho learned Spanish as a second language,
p144
aVor Haitians who spoke Creole.
p145
aVSo Spanish became part
p146
aVof the pre-pre-med curriculum.
p147
aVEven so, in Cuba,
p148
aVthe music, the food, the smells,
p149
aVjust about everything was different,
p150
aVso faculty became family, ELAM home.
p151
aVReligions ranged from indigenous beliefs
p152
aVto Yoruba, Muslim and Christian evangelical.
p153
aVEmbracing diversity became a way of life.
p154
aa(lp155
VWhy have so many countries
p156
aVasked for these scholarships?
p157
aVFirst, they just don't have enough doctors,
p158
aVand where they do, their distribution
p159
aVis skewed against the poor,
p160
aVbecause our global health crisis
p161
aVis fed by a crisis in human resources.
p162
aVWe are short four to seven million health workers
p163
aVjust to meet basic needs,
p164
aVand the problem is everywhere.
p165
aVDoctors are concentrated in the cities,
p166
aVwhere only half the world's people live,
p167
aVand within cities,
p168
aVnot in the shantytowns or South L.A.
p169
aVHere in the United States,
p170
aVwhere we have healthcare reform,
p171
aVwe don't have the professionals we need.
p172
aVBy 2020, we will be short
p173
aV45,000 primary care physicians.
p174
aVAnd we're also part of the problem.
p175
aVThe United States is the number one importer
p176
aVof doctors from developing countries.
p177
aa(lp178
VThe second reasons students flock to Cuba
p179
aVis the island's own health report card,
p180
aVrelying on strong primary care.
p181
aVA commission from The Lancet
p182
aVrates Cuba among the best performing
p183
aVmiddle-income countries in health.
p184
aVSave the Children ranks Cuba
p185
aVthe best country in Latin America to become a mother.
p186
aVCuba has similar life expectancy
p187
aVand lower infant mortality than the United States,
p188
aVwith fewer disparities,
p189
aVwhile spending per person
p190
aVone 20th of what we do on health
p191
aVhere in the USA.
p192
aa(lp193
VAcademically, ELAM is tough,
p194
aVbut 80 percent of its students graduate.
p195
aVThe subjects are familiar \u2014
p196
aVbasic and clinical sciences \u2014
p197
aVbut there are major differences.
p198
aVFirst, training has moved out of the ivory tower
p199
aVand into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods,
p200
aVthe kinds of places most of these grads will practice.
p201
aVSure, they have lectures and hospital rotations too,
p202
aVbut community-based learning starts on day one.
p203
aVSecond, students treat the whole patient,
p204
aVmind and body,
p205
aVin the context of their  families, their communities
p206
aVand their culture.
p207
aVThird, they learn public health:
p208
aVto assess their patients' drinking water, housing,
p209
aVsocial and economic conditions.
p210
aVFourth, they are taught
p211
aVthat a good patient interview
p212
aVand a thorough clinical exam
p213
aVprovide most of the clues for diagnosis,
p214
aVsaving costly technology for confirmation.
p215
aVAnd finally, they're taught over and over again
p216
aVthe importance of prevention,
p217
aVespecially as chronic diseases
p218
aVcripple health systems worldwide.
p219
aa(lp220
VSuch an in-service learning
p221
aValso comes with a team approach,
p222
aVas much how to work in teams
p223
aVas how to lead them,
p224
aVwith a dose of humility.
p225
aVUpon graduation, these doctors share
p226
aVtheir knowledge with nurse's aids, midwives,
p227
aVcommunity health workers,
p228
aVto help them become better at what they do,
p229
aVnot to replace them,
p230
aVto work with shamans and traditional healers.
p231
aa(lp232
VELAM's graduates:
p233
aVAre they proving this audacious experiment right?
p234
aVDozens of projects give us an inkling
p235
aVof what they're capable of doing.
p236
aVTake the Garífuna grads.
p237
aVThey not only went to work back home,
p238
aVbut they organized their communities to build
p239
aVHonduras' first indigenous hospital.
p240
aVWith an architect's help,
p241
aVresidents literally raised it from the ground up.
p242
aVThe first patients walked through the doors
p243
aVin December 2007,
p244
aVand since then, the hospital has received
p245
aVnearly one million patient visits.
p246
aVAnd government is paying attention,
p247
aVupholding the hospital as a model
p248
aVof rural public health for Honduras.
p249
aa(lp250
VELAM's graduates are smart,
p251
aVstrong and also dedicated.
p252
aVHaiti, January 2010.
p253
aVThe pain.
p254
aVPeople buried under 30 million tons of rubble.
p255
aVOverwhelming.
p256
aVThree hundred forty Cuban doctors
p257
aVwere already on the ground long term.
p258
aVMore were on their way. Many more were needed.
p259
aVAt ELAM, students worked round the clock
p260
aVto contact 2,000 graduates.
p261
aVAs a result, hundreds arrived in Haiti,
p262
aV27 countries' worth, from Mali in the Sahara
p263
aVto St. Lucia, Bolivia, Chile and the USA.
p264
aVThey spoke easily to each other in Spanish
p265
aVand listened to their patients in Creole
p266
aVthanks to Haitian medical students
p267
aVflown in from ELAM in Cuba.
p268
aVMany stayed for months,
p269
aVeven through the cholera epidemic.
p270
aa(lp271
VHundreds of Haitian graduates
p272
aVhad to pick up the pieces,
p273
aVovercome their own heartbreak,
p274
aVand then pick up the burden
p275
aVof building a new public health system for Haiti.
p276
aVToday, with aid of organizations and governments
p277
aVfrom Norway to Cuba to Brazil,
p278
aVdozens of new health centers have been built,
p279
aVstaffed, and in 35 cases, headed
p280
aVby ELAM graduates.
p281
aa(lp282
VYet the Haitian story
p283
aValso illustrates some of the bigger problems
p284
aVfaced in many countries.
p285
aVTake a look:
p286
aV748 Haitian graduates by  2012, when cholera struck,
p287
aVnearly half working in the public health sector
p288
aVbut one quarter unemployed,
p289
aVand 110 had left Haiti altogether.
p290
aVSo in the best case scenarios,
p291
aVthese graduates are staffing
p292
aVand thus strengthening public health systems,
p293
aVwhere often they're the only doctors around.
p294
aVIn the worst cases, there are simply not enough jobs
p295
aVin the public health sector,
p296
aVwhere most poor people are treated,
p297
aVnot enough political will, not enough resources,
p298
aVnot enough anything \u2014
p299
aVjust too many patients with no care.
p300
aVThe grads face pressure from their families too,
p301
aVdesperate to make ends meet,
p302
aVso when there are no public sector jobs,
p303
aVthese new MDs decamp into private practice,
p304
aVor go abroad to send money home.
p305
aa(lp306
VWorst of all, in some countries,
p307
aVmedical societies influence accreditation bodies
p308
aVnot to honor the ELAM degree,
p309
aVfearful these grads will take their jobs
p310
aVor reduce their patient loads and income.
p311
aVIt's not a question of competencies.
p312
aVHere in the USA, the California Medical Board
p313
aVaccredited the school after rigorous inspection,
p314
aVand the new physicians are making good
p315
aVon Cuba's big bet,
p316
aVpassing their boards and accepted
p317
aVinto highly respected residencies
p318
aVfrom New York to Chicago to New Mexico.
p319
aVTwo hundred strong, they're coming
p320
aVback to the United States energized,
p321
aVand also dissatisfied.
p322
aVAs one grad put it,
p323
aVin Cuba, "We are trained to provide quality care
p324
aVwith minimal resources,
p325
aVso when I see all the resources we have here,
p326
aVand you tell me that's not possible,
p327
aVI know it's not true.
p328
aVNot only have I seen it work, I've done the work."
p329
aa(lp330
VELAM's graduates,
p331
aVsome from right here in D.C. and Baltimore,
p332
aVhave come from the poorest of the poor
p333
aVto offer health, education
p334
aVand a voice to their communities.
p335
aVThey've done the heavy lifting.
p336
aVNow we need to do our part
p337
aVto support the 23,000 and counting,
p338
aVAll of us \u2014
p339
aVfoundations, residency directors, press,
p340
aVentrepreneurs, policymakers, people \u2014
p341
aVneed to step up.
p342
aVWe need to do much more globally
p343
aVto give these new doctors the opportunity
p344
aVto prove their mettle.
p345
aVThey need to be able
p346
aVto take their countries' licensing exams.
p347
aVThey need jobs in the public health sector
p348
aVor in nonprofit health centers
p349
aVto put their training and commitment to work.
p350
aVThey need the chance to be
p351
aVthe doctors their patients need.
p352
aa(lp353
VTo move forward,
p354
aVwe may have to find our way back
p355
aVto that pediatrician who would
p356
aVknock on my family's door
p357
aVon the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid,
p358
aVwho made house calls,
p359
aVwho was a public servant.
p360
aVThese aren't such new ideas
p361
aVof what medicine should be.
p362
aVWhat's new is the scaling up
p363
aVand the faces of the doctors themselves:
p364
aVan ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she
p365
aVthan a he;
p366
aVIn the Amazon, Peru or Guatemala,
p367
aVan indigenous doctor;
p368
aVin the USA, a doctor of color
p369
aVwho speaks fluent Spanish.
p370
aVShe is well trained, can be counted on,
p371
aVand shares the face and culture of her patients,
p372
aVand she deserves our support surely,
p373
aVbecause whether by subway, mule, or canoe,
p374
aVshe is teaching us to walk the walk.
p375
aa(lp376
VThank you. (Applause)

VI'd like to talk a little bit this morning
p5
aVabout what happens if we move from design
p6
aVto design thinking.
p7
aVNow this rather old photo up there
p8
aVis actually the first project I was ever hired to do,
p9
aVsomething like 25 years ago.
p10
aVIt's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one,
p11
aVand my task was to
p12
aVmake this thing a little bit more modern,
p13
aVa little bit easier to use.
p14
aVI thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job.
p15
aVUnfortunately, not very long afterwards
p16
aVthe company went out of business.
p17
aa(lp18
VThis is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine.
p19
aVI put an attractive shell around some new technology.
p20
aVAgain, 18 months later,
p21
aVthe product was obsolete.
p22
aVAnd now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.
p23
aVNow, I'm a fairly slow learner,
p24
aVbut eventually it occurred to me that
p25
aVmaybe what passed for design
p26
aVwasn't all that important \u2014
p27
aVmaking things more attractive,
p28
aVmaking them a bit easier to use,
p29
aVmaking them more marketable.
p30
aVBy focusing on a design,
p31
aVmaybe just a single product,
p32
aVI was being incremental
p33
aVand not having much of an impact.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut I think this small view of design
p36
aVis a relatively recent phenomenon,
p37
aVand in fact really emerged
p38
aVin the latter half of the 20th century
p39
aVas design became a tool of consumerism.
p40
aVSo when we talk about design today,
p41
aVand particularly when we read about it in the popular press,
p42
aVwe're often talking about products like these.
p43
aVAmusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.
p44
aVImportant? Not so very.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut this wasn't always the way.
p47
aVAnd I'd like to suggest that if we take
p48
aVa different view of design,
p49
aVand focus less on the object
p50
aVand more on design thinking as an approach,
p51
aVthat we actually might see the result in a bigger impact.
p52
aVNow this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel,
p53
aVdesigned many great things in his career in the 19th century,
p54
aVincluding the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol
p55
aVand the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.
p56
aVBoth great designs and actually very innovative too.
p57
aVHis greatest creation
p58
aVruns actually right through here in Oxford.
p59
aVIt's called the Great Western Railway.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd as a kid I grew up very close to here,
p62
aVand one of my favorite things to do
p63
aVwas to cycle along by the side of the railway
p64
aVwaiting for the great big express trains to roar past.
p65
aVYou can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,
p66
aV"Rain, Steam and Speed".
p67
aVNow, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers
p68
aVwas the experience of floating across the countryside.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, this was back in the 19th century.
p71
aVAnd to do that meant creating the flattest gradients
p72
aVthat had ever yet been made,
p73
aVwhich meant building long viaducts across river valleys \u2014
p74
aVthis is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead \u2014
p75
aVand long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire.
p76
aVBut he didn't stop there. He didn't stop
p77
aVwith just trying to design the best railway journey.
p78
aVHe imagined an integrated transportation system
p79
aVin which it would be possible for a passenger to embark
p80
aVon a train in London
p81
aVand disembark from a ship in New York.
p82
aVOne journey from London to New York.
p83
aVThis is the S.S. Great Western that he built
p84
aVto take care of the second half of that journey.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, Brunel was working 100 years before
p87
aVthe emergence of the design profession,
p88
aVbut I think he was using design thinking
p89
aVto solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.
p90
aVNow, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,
p91
aVthe business school professor at the University of Toronto,
p92
aVcalls integrative thinking.
p93
aVAnd that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas
p94
aVand opposing constraints
p95
aVto create new solutions.
p96
aVIn the case of design, that means
p97
aVbalancing desirability, what humans need,
p98
aVwith technical feasibility,
p99
aVand economic viability.
p100
aVWith innovations like the Great Western,
p101
aVwe can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo somehow, we went from this to this.
p104
aVSystems thinkers who were reinventing the world,
p105
aVto a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses
p106
aVworking on small things.
p107
aVAs our industrial society matured,
p108
aVso design became a profession
p109
aVand it focused on an ever smaller canvas
p110
aVuntil it came to stand for aesthetics,
p111
aVimage and fashion.
p112
aVNow I'm not trying to throw stones here.
p113
aVI'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,
p114
aVand somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.
p115
aVThere we go.
p116
aVBut I do think that perhaps design
p117
aVis getting big again.
p118
aVAnd that's happening through
p119
aVthe application of design thinking
p120
aVto new kinds of problems \u2014
p121
aVto global warming, to education,
p122
aVhealthcare, security, clean water, whatever.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd as we see this reemergence of design thinking
p125
aVand we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,
p126
aVthere are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.
p127
aVAnd I'd like to talk about some of those
p128
aVjust for the next few minutes.
p129
aVThe first of those is that design is
p130
aVhuman-centered.
p131
aVIt may integrate technology and economics,
p132
aVbut it starts with what humans need, or might need.
p133
aVWhat makes life easier, more enjoyable?
p134
aVWhat makes technology useful and usable?
p135
aVBut that is more than simply good ergonomics,
p136
aVputting the buttons in the right place.
p137
aVIt's often about understanding culture and context
p138
aVbefore we even know where to start to have ideas.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India,
p141
aVthey wanted to understand what the aspirations
p142
aVand motivations were of these school children
p143
aVto understand how they might play a role
p144
aVin screening their parents.
p145
aVConversion Sound has developed a high quality,
p146
aVultra-low-cost digital hearing aid
p147
aVfor the developing world.
p148
aVNow, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians
p149
aVto fit these hearing aids.
p150
aVIn places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.
p151
aVSo it took a team working in India
p152
aVwith patients and community health workers
p153
aVto understand how a PDA
p154
aVand an application on a PDA
p155
aVmight replace those technicians
p156
aVin a fitting and diagnostic service.
p157
aa(lp158
VInstead of starting with technology,
p159
aVthe team started with people and culture.
p160
aVSo if human need is the place to start,
p161
aVthen design thinking rapidly moves on to
p162
aVlearning by making.
p163
aVInstead of thinking about what to build,
p164
aVbuilding in order to think.
p165
aVNow, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,
p166
aVbecause it is only when we put our ideas out into the world
p167
aVthat we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
p168
aVAnd the faster we do that,
p169
aVthe faster our ideas evolve.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, much has been said and written about
p172
aVthe Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.
p173
aVThey do an incredible job of serving very poor patients
p174
aVby taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay
p175
aVto cross-subsidize those who cannot.
p176
aVNow, they are very efficient,
p177
aVbut they are also very innovative.
p178
aVWhen I visited them a few years ago,
p179
aVwhat really impressed me was their willingness
p180
aVto prototype their ideas very early.
p181
aa(lp182
VThis is the manufacturing facility
p183
aVfor one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.
p184
aVThey make their own intraocular lenses.
p185
aVThese are the lenses that replace those
p186
aVthat are damaged by cataracts.
p187
aVAnd I think it's partly their prototyping mentality
p188
aVthat really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.
p189
aVBecause they brought the cost down
p190
aVfrom $200 a pair,
p191
aVdown to just $4 a pair.
p192
aVPartly they did this by instead of building
p193
aVa fancy new factory,
p194
aVthey used the basement of one of their hospitals.
p195
aVAnd instead of installing the large-scale machines
p196
aVused by western producers,
p197
aVthey used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.
p198
aVThey are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world
p199
aVand have recently moved into a custom factory.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo if human need is the place to start,
p202
aVand prototyping, a vehicle for progress,
p203
aVthen there are also some questions to ask about the destination.
p204
aVInstead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,
p205
aVdesign thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation \u2014
p206
aVthe shift from a passive relationship
p207
aVbetween consumer and producer
p208
aVto the active engagement of everyone
p209
aVin experiences that are meaningful,
p210
aVproductive and profitable.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about,
p213
aVthis notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,
p214
aVand take that a little bit further and say that
p215
aVI think the design of participatory systems,
p216
aVin which many more forms of value
p217
aVbeyond simply cash
p218
aVare both created and measured,
p219
aVis going to be the major theme, not only for design,
p220
aVbut also for our economy as we go forward.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942,
p223
aVcreated what became Britain's welfare state
p224
aVin which he hoped that every citizen
p225
aVwould be an active participant
p226
aVin their own social well-being.
p227
aVBy the time he wrote his third report,
p228
aVhe confessed that he had failed
p229
aVand instead had created a society of welfare consumers.
p230
aa(lp231
VHilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater,
p232
aVand Hugo Manassei of Participle
p233
aVhave taken this idea of participation,
p234
aVand in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,
p235
aVthey are suggesting a framework
p236
aVfor reinventing the welfare state.
p237
aVSo in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,
p238
aVthey worked with residents in Southwark, South London
p239
aVand a small team of designers
p240
aVto develop a new membership organization
p241
aVto help the elderly with household tasks.
p242
aVDesigns were refined and developed
p243
aVwith 150 older people and their families
p244
aVbefore the service was launched earlier this year.
p245
aa(lp246
VWe can take this idea of participation
p247
aVperhaps to its logical conclusion
p248
aVand say that design may have its greatest impact
p249
aVwhen it's taken out of the hands of designers
p250
aVand put into the hands of everyone.
p251
aVNurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system
p252
aVKaiser Permanente
p253
aVstudy the topic of improving the patient experience,
p254
aVand particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge
p255
aVand change shift.
p256
aVThrough a program of observational research,
p257
aVbrainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,
p258
aVthey've developed a completely new way to change shift.
p259
aa(lp260
VThey went from retreating to the nurse's station
p261
aVto discuss the various states and needs of patients,
p262
aVto developing a system that happened on the ward
p263
aVin front of patients, using a simple software tool.
p264
aVBy doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients
p265
aVdown from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average.
p266
aVThey increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.
p267
aVWhen you multiply that by all the nurses
p268
aVin all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,
p269
aVit resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd this is just one of thousands
p272
aVof opportunities in healthcare alone.
p273
aVSo these are just some of the kind of basic ideas
p274
aVaround design thinking
p275
aVand some of the new kinds of projects
p276
aVthat they're being applied to.
p277
aVBut I'd like to go back to Brunel here,
p278
aVand suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,
p279
aVand maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.
p280
aVAnd that connection is change.
p281
aVIn times of change we need
p282
aVnew alternatives, new ideas.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution,
p285
aVwhen all of life and our economy
p286
aVwas being reinvented.
p287
aVNow the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,
p288
aVand indeed they are part of the problem today.
p289
aVBut, again, we are in the midst of massive change.
p290
aVAnd that change is forcing us to question
p291
aVquite fundamental aspects of our society \u2014
p292
aVhow we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,
p293
aVhow we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.
p294
aVAnd in these times of change, we need these new choices
p295
aVbecause our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo why design thinking?
p298
aVBecause it gives us a new way of tackling problems.
p299
aVInstead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach
p300
aVwhere we make the best choice out of available alternatives,
p301
aVit encourages us to take a divergent approach,
p302
aVto explore new alternatives, new solutions,
p303
aVnew ideas that have not existed before.
p304
aVBut before we go through that process of divergence,
p305
aVthere is actually quite an important first step.
p306
aVAnd that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?
p307
aVWhat's the design brief?
p308
aVNow Brunel may have asked a question like this,
p309
aV"How do I take a train from London to New York?"
p310
aVBut what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?
p311
aa(lp312
VSo these are some that we've been asked to think about recently.
p313
aVAnd one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,
p314
aVin a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
p315
aVHow might we improve access to safe drinking water
p316
aVfor the world's poorest people,
p317
aVand at the same time stimulate innovation
p318
aVamongst local water providers?
p319
aa(lp320
VSo instead of having a bunch of American designers
p321
aVcome up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,
p322
aVwe took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.
p323
aVWe teamed designers and investment experts up with
p324
aV11 water organizations across India.
p325
aVAnd through workshops they developed
p326
aVinnovative new products, services, and business models.
p327
aa(lp328
VWe hosted a competition
p329
aVand then funded five of those organizations
p330
aVto develop their ideas.
p331
aVSo they developed and iterated these ideas.
p332
aVAnd then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them
p333
aVto help design new social marketing campaigns,
p334
aVcommunity outreach strategies, business models,
p335
aVnew water vessels for storing water
p336
aVand carts for delivering water.
p337
aVSome of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.
p338
aVAnd the same process is just getting underway
p339
aVwith NGOs in East Africa.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo for me, this project shows
p342
aVkind of how far we can go from
p343
aVsome of those sort of small things
p344
aVthat I was working on
p345
aVat the beginning of my career.
p346
aVThat by focusing on the needs of humans
p347
aVand by using prototypes
p348
aVto move ideas along quickly,
p349
aVby getting the process out of the hands of designers,
p350
aVand by getting the active participation of the community,
p351
aVwe can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.
p352
aVAnd just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,
p353
aVwe can have a bigger impact.
p354
aVSo that's one thing that we've been working on.
p355
aa(lp356
VI'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested
p357
aVto know what this community thinks we could work on.
p358
aVWhat kinds of questions do we think
p359
aVdesign thinking could be used to tackle?
p360
aVAnd if you've got any ideas
p361
aVthen feel free, you can post them to Twitter.
p362
aVThere is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ.
p363
aVAnd the list looked something like this a little while ago.
p364
aVAnd of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in
p365
aVby using the same hash code.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo I'd like to believe that design thinking
p368
aVactually can make a difference,
p369
aVthat it can help create new ideas
p370
aVand new innovations,
p371
aVbeyond the latest High Street products.
p372
aVTo do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design,
p373
aVmore like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood.
p374
aVAnd the first step is to start asking the right questions.
p375
aVThank you very much.
p376

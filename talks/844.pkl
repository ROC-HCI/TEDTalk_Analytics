VHi, my name is Roz Savage
p5
aVand I row across oceans.
p6
aVFour years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic,
p7
aVand since then, I've done two out of three stages
p8
aVacross the Pacific,
p9
aVfrom San Francisco to Hawaii
p10
aVand from Hawaii to Kiribati.
p11
aVAnd tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat
p12
aVto fly back to Kiribati
p13
aVto continue with the third and final stage
p14
aVof my row across the Pacific.
p15
aVCumulatively, I will have rowed
p16
aVover 8,000 miles,
p17
aVtaken over three million oar strokes
p18
aVand spent more than 312 days alone
p19
aVon the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.
p20
aVThis has given me a very
p21
aVspecial relationship with the ocean.
p22
aVWe have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.
p23
aVI feel a bit about it like I did about
p24
aVa very strict math teacher that I once had at school.
p25
aVI didn't always like her, but I did respect her,
p26
aVand she taught me a heck of a lot.
p27
aVSo today I'd like to share with you
p28
aVsome of my ocean adventures
p29
aVand tell you a little bit about what they've taught me,
p30
aVand how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons
p31
aVand apply them to this environmental challenge
p32
aVthat we face right now.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, some of you might be thinking,
p35
aV"Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower.
p36
aVIsn't she meant to be about this tall
p37
aVand about this wide
p38
aVand maybe look a bit more like these guys?"
p39
aVYou'll notice, they've all got something that I don't.
p40
aVWell, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter)
p41
aVAnd no matter how long I've spent on the ocean,
p42
aVI haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard,
p43
aVand I hope that it remains that way.
p44
aa(lp45
VFor a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure.
p46
aVThe story that I told myself was
p47
aVthat adventurers looked like this.
p48
aVI didn't look the part.
p49
aVI thought there were them and there were us,
p50
aVand I was not one of them.
p51
aVSo for 11 years, I conformed.
p52
aVI did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.
p53
aVI was working in an office in London
p54
aVas a management consultant.
p55
aVAnd I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me.
p56
aVBut that kind of conditioning
p57
aVjust kept me there for so many years,
p58
aVuntil I reached my mid-30s and I thought,
p59
aV"You know, I'm not getting any younger.
p60
aVI feel like I've got a purpose in this life, and I don't know what it is,
p61
aVbut I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo, fast forward a few years.
p64
aVI'd gone through some changes.
p65
aVTo try and answer that question of,
p66
aV"What am I supposed to be doing with my life?"
p67
aVI sat down one day
p68
aVand wrote two versions of my own obituary,
p69
aVthe one that I wanted, a life of adventure,
p70
aVand the one that I was actually heading for
p71
aVwhich was a nice, normal, pleasant life,
p72
aVbut it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.
p73
aVI wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.
p74
aVAnd I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary
p75
aVand thinking, "Oh boy,
p76
aVI'm on totally the wrong track here.
p77
aVIf I carry on living as I am now,
p78
aVI'm just not going to end up where I want to be
p79
aVin five years, or 10 years,
p80
aVor at the end of my life."
p81
aVI made a few changes,
p82
aVlet go of some loose trappings of my old life,
p83
aVand through a bit of a leap of logic,
p84
aVdecided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VThe Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua,
p89
aVit's about 3,000 miles,
p90
aVand it turned out to be
p91
aVthe hardest thing I had ever done.
p92
aVSure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,
p93
aVbut what I'd sort of failed to notice was that
p94
aVgetting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,
p95
aVextremely uncomfortable.
p96
aVAnd my timing was not great either:
p97
aV2005, when I did the Atlantic,
p98
aVwas the year of Hurricane Katrina.
p99
aVThere were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic
p100
aVthan ever before, since records began.
p101
aVAnd pretty early on,
p102
aVthose storms started making their presence known.
p103
aa(lp104
VAll four of my oars broke
p105
aVbefore I reached halfway across.
p106
aVOars are not supposed to look like this.
p107
aVBut what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.
p108
aVOars are your only means of propulsion.
p109
aVSo I just had to look around the boat
p110
aVand figure out what I was going to use
p111
aVto fix up these oars so that I could carry on.
p112
aVSo I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape
p113
aVand splintered the boat hook
p114
aVto the oars to reinforce it.
p115
aVThen, when that gave out,
p116
aVI sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat
p117
aVand used those.
p118
aVAnd then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.
p119
aVI'd never been very good at fixing stuff
p120
aVwhen I was living my old life,
p121
aVbut it's amazing how resourceful you can become
p122
aVwhen you're in the middle of the ocean
p123
aVand there's only one way to get to the other side.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd the oars kind of became a symbol
p126
aVof just in how many ways
p127
aVI went beyond what I thought were my limits.
p128
aVI suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders
p129
aVand saltwater sores on my bottom.
p130
aVI really struggled psychologically,
p131
aVtotally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,
p132
aVrealizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,
p133
aV3,000 miles was going to
p134
aVtake me a very, very long time.
p135
aVThere were so many times
p136
aVwhen I thought I'd hit that limit,
p137
aVbut had no choice but to just carry on
p138
aVand try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side
p139
aVwithout driving myself crazy.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd eventually after
p142
aV103 days at sea,
p143
aVI arrived in Antigua.
p144
aVI don't think I've ever felt so happy
p145
aVin my entire life.
p146
aVIt was a bit like finishing a marathon
p147
aVand getting out of solitary confinement
p148
aVand winning an Oscar all rolled into one.
p149
aVI was euphoric.
p150
aVAnd to see all the people coming out to greet me
p151
aVand standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,
p152
aVI just felt like a movie star.
p153
aVIt was absolutely wonderful.
p154
aVAnd I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,
p155
aVthe bigger the sense of achievement
p156
aVwhen you get to the end of it.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out
p159
aVto answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing
p160
aVthat might be going through your mind.
p161
aVNumber one that I get asked: What do you eat?
p162
aVA few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eat
p163
aVmuch more unprocessed foods.
p164
aVSo I grow my own beansprouts.
p165
aVI eat fruits and nut bars,
p166
aVa lot of nuts.
p167
aVAnd generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter
p168
aVat the other end.
p169
aVQuestion number two: How do you sleep?
p170
aVWith my eyes shut. Ha-ha.
p171
aVI suppose what you mean is:
p172
aVWhat happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?
p173
aVWell, I plan my route so that I'm drifting
p174
aVwith the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.
p175
aVOn a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles
p176
aVin the right direction.
p177
aVWorst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.
p178
aVThat's a bad day at the office.
p179
aVWhat do I wear?
p180
aVMostly, a baseball cap,
p181
aVrowing gloves and a smile \u2014 or a frown,
p182
aVdepending on whether I went backwards overnight \u2014
p183
aVand lots of sun lotion.
p184
aVDo I have a chase boat?
p185
aVNo I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.
p186
aVI don't see anybody for the whole time
p187
aVthat I'm at sea, generally.
p188
aVAnd finally: Am I crazy?
p189
aVWell, I leave that one up to you to judge.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?
p192
aVWell, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.
p193
aVWell, I thought the Atlantic was big,
p194
aVbut the Pacific is really, really big.
p195
aVI think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.
p196
aVI don't know for sure that the Brits
p197
aVinvented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so:
p198
aVwe are right in the middle,
p199
aVand we've cut the Pacific in half
p200
aVand flung it to the far corners of the world.
p201
aVWhereas if you look in Google Earth,
p202
aVthis is how the Pacific looks.
p203
aVIt pretty much covers half the planet.
p204
aVYou can just see a little bit of North America up here
p205
aVand a sliver of Australia down there.
p206
aVIt is really big \u2014
p207
aV65 million square miles \u2014
p208
aVand to row in a straight line across it
p209
aVwould be about 8,000 miles.
p210
aVUnfortunately, ocean rowboats
p211
aVvery rarely go in a straight line.
p212
aVBy the time I get to Australia,
p213
aVif I get to Australia,
p214
aVI will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo, because nobody in their straight mind would row
p217
aVstraight past Hawaii without dropping in,
p218
aVI decided to cut this very big undertaking
p219
aVinto three segments.
p220
aVThe first attempt didn't go so well.
p221
aVIn 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drill
p222
aVthree times in 24 hours.
p223
aVA bit like being in a washing machine.
p224
aVBoat got a bit dinged up,
p225
aVso did I.
p226
aVI blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebody
p227
aVwith a bit of a hero complex decided that
p228
aVthis damsel was in distress and needed saving.
p229
aVThe first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.
p230
aVI tried to tell them to go away.
p231
aVWe had a bit of a battle of wills.
p232
aVI lost and got airlifted.
p233
aVAwful, really awful.
p234
aVIt was one of the worst feelings of my life,
p235
aVas I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter
p236
aVand looked down at my trusty little boat
p237
aVrolling around in the 20 foot waves
p238
aVand wondering if I would ever see her again.
p239
aVSo I had to launch a very expensive
p240
aVsalvage operation
p241
aVand then wait another nine months
p242
aVbefore I could get back out onto the ocean again.
p243
aa(lp244
VBut what do you do?
p245
aVFall down nine times, get up 10.
p246
aVSo, the following year, I set out
p247
aVand, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.
p248
aVBut it was not without misadventure.
p249
aVMy watermaker broke,
p250
aVonly the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.
p251
aVPowered by my solar panels,
p252
aVit sucks in saltwater
p253
aVand turns it into freshwater.
p254
aVBut it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean,
p255
aVwhich is what happened to it.
p256
aVFortunately, help was at hand.
p257
aa(lp258
VThere was another unusual boat out there
p259
aVat the same time, doing as I was doing,
p260
aVbringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,
p261
aVthat area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,
p262
aVwith an estimated 3.5 million
p263
aVtons of trash in it,
p264
aVcirculating at the center of
p265
aVthat North Pacific Gyre.
p266
aVSo, to make the point, these guys
p267
aVhad actually built their boat out of plastic trash,
p268
aV15,000 empty water bottles
p269
aVlatched together into two pontoons.
p270
aVThey were going very slowly.
p271
aVPartly, they'd had a bit of a delay.
p272
aVThey'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach
p273
aVbecause the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,
p274
aVand they were starting to sink.
p275
aVSo they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.
p276
aa(lp277
VBut, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,
p278
aVluckily, our courses were converging.
p279
aVThey were running out of food; I was running out of water.
p280
aVSo we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.
p281
aVAnd it took about a week
p282
aVfor us to actually gradually converge.
p283
aVI was doing a pathetically slow speed
p284
aVof about 1.3 knots,
p285
aVand they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:
p286
aVit was like two snails in a mating dance.
p287
aVBut, eventually, we did manage to meet up
p288
aVand Joel hopped overboard,
p289
aVcaught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,
p290
aVwhich was the best food I'd had
p291
aVin, ooh, at least three months.
p292
aa(lp293
VFortunately, the one that he caught that day
p294
aVwas better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.
p295
aVWhen they opened this one up,
p296
aVthey found its stomach was full of plastic.
p297
aVAnd this is really bad news because plastic
p298
aVis not an inert substance.
p299
aVIt leaches out chemicals
p300
aVinto the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,
p301
aVand then we come along and eat that poor critter,
p302
aVand we get some of the toxins accumulating
p303
aVin our bodies as well.
p304
aVSo there are very real implications for human health.
p305
aa(lp306
VI eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.
p307
aVAnd, the following year, set out
p308
aVon the second stage of the Pacific,
p309
aVfrom Hawaii down to Tarawa.
p310
aVAnd you'll notice something about Tarawa;
p311
aVit is very low-lying.
p312
aVIt's that little green sliver on the horizon,
p313
aVwhich makes them very nervous
p314
aVabout rising oceans.
p315
aVThis is big trouble for these guys.
p316
aVThey've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.
p317
aVAnd also, as an increase in extreme
p318
aVweather events due to climate change,
p319
aVthey're expecting more waves
p320
aVto come in over the fringing reef,
p321
aVwhich will contaminate their fresh water supply.
p322
aVI had a meeting with the president there,
p323
aVwho told me about his
p324
aVexit strategy for his country.
p325
aVHe expects that within the next 50 years,
p326
aVthe 100,000 people that live there
p327
aVwill have to relocate to
p328
aVNew Zealand or Australia.
p329
aVAnd that made me think about how would I feel
p330
aVif Britain was going to disappear under the waves;
p331
aVif the places where I'd been born
p332
aVand gone to school
p333
aVand got married,
p334
aVif all those places were just going to disappear forever.
p335
aVHow, literally, ungrounded
p336
aVthat would make me feel.
p337
aa(lp338
VVery shortly, I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia,
p339
aVand if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row solo
p340
aVall the way across the Pacific.
p341
aVAnd I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues,
p342
aVto bring a human face to the ocean.
p343
aVIf the Atlantic was about my inner journey,
p344
aVdiscovering my own capabilities,
p345
aVmaybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey,
p346
aVfiguring out how I can use
p347
aVmy interesting career choice
p348
aVto be of service to the world,
p349
aVand to take some of those things that I've learned out there
p350
aVand apply them to the situation
p351
aVthat humankind now finds itself in.
p352
aa(lp353
VI think there are probably three key points here.
p354
aVThe first one is about
p355
aVthe stories that we tell ourselves.
p356
aVFor so long, I told myself
p357
aVthat I couldn't have an adventure
p358
aVbecause I wasn't six foot tall
p359
aVand athletic and bearded.
p360
aVAnd then that story changed.
p361
aVI found out that people had rowed across oceans.
p362
aVI even met one of them and she was just about my size.
p363
aVSo even though I didn't grow any taller,
p364
aVI didn't sprout a beard,
p365
aVsomething had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.
p366
aVAt the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves
p367
aVis that we need all this stuff,
p368
aVthat we need oil.
p369
aVBut what about if we just change that story?
p370
aVWe do have alternatives,
p371
aVand we have the power of free will
p372
aVto choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones,
p373
aVto create a greener future.
p374
aa(lp375
VThe second point is about
p376
aVthe accumulation of tiny actions.
p377
aVWe might think that anything that we do as an individual
p378
aVis just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.
p379
aVBut it does. Generally, we haven't
p380
aVgot ourselves into this mess through big disasters.
p381
aVYes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes
p382
aVand the Chernobyls,
p383
aVbut mostly it's been an accumulation
p384
aVof bad decisions
p385
aVby billions of individuals,
p386
aVday after day and year after year.
p387
aVAnd, by the same token, we can turn that tide.
p388
aVWe can start making better,
p389
aVwiser, more sustainable decisions.
p390
aVAnd when we do that, we're not just one person.
p391
aVAnything that we do spreads ripples.
p392
aVOther people will see if you're in the supermarket line
p393
aVand you pull out your
p394
aVreusable grocery bag.
p395
aVMaybe if we all start doing this,
p396
aVwe can make it socially unacceptable
p397
aVto say yes to plastic in the checkout line.
p398
aVThat's just one example.
p399
aVThis is a world-wide community.
p400
aa(lp401
VThe other point:
p402
aVIt's about taking responsibility.
p403
aVFor so much of my life,
p404
aVI wanted something else to make me happy.
p405
aVI thought if I had the right house or the right car
p406
aVor the right man in my life,
p407
aVthen I could be happy.
p408
aVBut when I wrote that obituary exercise,
p409
aVI actually grew up a little bit in that moment
p410
aVand realized that I needed to create my own future.
p411
aVI couldn't just wait passively
p412
aVfor happiness to come and find me.
p413
aVAnd I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.
p414
aVI plan on being around for a long time,
p415
aVand when I'm 90 years old,
p416
aVI want to be happy and healthy.
p417
aVAnd it's very difficult to be happy
p418
aVon a planet that's racked
p419
aVwith famine and drought.
p420
aVIt's very difficult to be healthy on a planet
p421
aVwhere we've poisoned the earth
p422
aVand the sea and the air.
p423
aa(lp424
VSo, shortly, I'm going to be
p425
aVlaunching a new initiative
p426
aVcalled Eco-Heroes.
p427
aVAnd the idea here is that
p428
aVall our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.
p429
aVIt's meant to be a bit of a game.
p430
aVWe're going to make an iPhone app out of it.
p431
aVWe just want to try and create that awareness
p432
aVbecause, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world,
p433
aVbut that attitude,
p434
aVthat awareness that leads you to change the light bulb
p435
aVor take your reusable coffee mug,
p436
aVthat is what could change the world.
p437
aa(lp438
VI really believe that we stand
p439
aVat a very important point in history.
p440
aVWe have a choice. We've been blessed,
p441
aVor cursed, with free will.
p442
aVWe can choose a greener future,
p443
aVand we can get there
p444
aVif we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time.
p445
aa(lp446
VThank you.

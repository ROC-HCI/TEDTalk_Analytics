VSo when I was eight years old,
p5
aVa new girl came to join the class,
p6
aVand she was so impressive,
p7
aVas the new girl always seems to be.
p8
aVShe had vast quantities of very shiny hair
p9
aVand a cute little pencil case,
p10
aVsuper strong on state capitals,
p11
aVjust a great speller.
p12
aVAnd I just curdled with jealousy that year,
p13
aVuntil I hatched my devious plan.
p14
aVSo one day I stayed a little late after school,
p15
aVa little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom.
p16
aVWhen the coast was clear, I emerged,
p17
aVcrept into the classroom,
p18
aVand took from my teacher's desk the grade book.
p19
aVAnd then I did it.
p20
aVI fiddled with my rival's grades,
p21
aVjust a little, just demoted some of those A's.
p22
aVAll of those A's. (Laughter)
p23
aVAnd I got ready to return the book to the drawer,
p24
aVwhen hang on, some of my other classmates
p25
aVhad appallingly good grades too.
p26
aVSo, in a frenzy,
p27
aVI corrected everybody's marks,
p28
aVnot imaginatively.
p29
aVI gave everybody a row of D's
p30
aVand I gave myself a row of A's,
p31
aVjust because I was there, you know, might as well.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd I am still baffled by my behavior.
p34
aVI don't understand where the idea came from.
p35
aVI don't understand why I felt so great doing it.
p36
aVI felt great.
p37
aVI don't understand why I was never caught.
p38
aVI mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious.
p39
aVI was never caught.
p40
aVBut most of all, I am baffled by,
p41
aVwhy did it bother me so much
p42
aVthat this little girl, this tiny little girl,
p43
aVwas so good at spelling?
p44
aVJealousy baffles me.
p45
aVIt's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.
p46
aVWe know babies suffer from jealousy.
p47
aVWe know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.
p48
aVWe know that jealousy is the number one cause
p49
aVof spousal murder in the United States.
p50
aVAnd yet, I have never read a study
p51
aVthat can parse to me its loneliness
p52
aVor its longevity or its grim thrill.
p53
aVFor that, we have to go to fiction,
p54
aVbecause the novel is the lab
p55
aVthat has studied jealousy
p56
aVin every possible configuration.
p57
aVIn fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say
p58
aVthat if we didn't have jealousy,
p59
aVwould we even have literature?
p60
aVWell no faithless Helen, no "Odyssey."
p61
aVNo jealous king, no "Arabian Nights."
p62
aVNo Shakespeare.
p63
aVThere goes high school reading lists,
p64
aVbecause we're losing "Sound and the Fury,"
p65
aVwe're losing "Gatsby," "Sun Also Rises,"
p66
aVwe're losing "Madame Bovary," "Anna K."
p67
aVNo jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean,
p68
aVI know it's fashionable to say that Proust
p69
aVhas the answers to everything,
p70
aVbut in the case of jealousy,
p71
aVhe kind of does.
p72
aVThis year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time,"
p73
aVand it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy
p74
aVand just regular competitiveness, my brand,
p75
aVthat we can hope to have. (Laughter)
p76
aVAnd we think about Proust, we think
p77
aVabout the sentimental bits, right?
p78
aVWe think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.
p79
aVWe think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.
p80
aVWe forget how harsh his vision was.
p81
aVWe forget how pitiless he is.
p82
aVI mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said
p83
aVwere tough as cat gut.
p84
aVI don't know what cat gut is,
p85
aVbut let's assume it's formidable.
p86
aa(lp87
VLet's look at why they go so well together,
p88
aVthe novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.
p89
aVIs it something as obvious as that jealousy,
p90
aVwhich boils down into person, desire, impediment,
p91
aVis such a solid narrative foundation?
p92
aVI don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,
p93
aVbecause let's think about what happens
p94
aVwhen we feel jealous.
p95
aVWhen we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.
p96
aVWe tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,
p97
aVand these stories make us feel terrible
p98
aVbecause they're designed to make us feel terrible.
p99
aVAs the teller of the tale and the audience,
p100
aVwe know just what details to include,
p101
aVto dig that knife in. Right?
p102
aVJealousy makes us all amateur novelists,
p103
aVand this is something Proust understood.
p104
aa(lp105
VIn the first volume, Swann's Way,
p106
aVthe series of books,
p107
aVSwann, one of the main characters,
p108
aVis thinking very fondly of his mistress
p109
aVand how great she is in bed,
p110
aVand suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,
p111
aVand these are Proustian sentences,
p112
aVso they're long as rivers,
p113
aVbut in the course of a few sentences,
p114
aVhe suddenly recoils and he realizes,
p115
aV"Hang on, everything I love about this woman,
p116
aVsomebody else would love about this woman.
p117
aVEverything that she does that gives me pleasure
p118
aVcould be giving somebody else pleasure,
p119
aVmaybe right about now."
p120
aVAnd this is the story he starts to tell himself,
p121
aVand from then on, Proust writes that
p122
aVevery fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,
p123
aVhe adds to his "collection of instruments
p124
aVin his private torture chamber."
p125
aa(lp126
VNow Swann and Proust, we have to admit,
p127
aVwere notoriously jealous.
p128
aVYou know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave
p129
aVthe country if they wanted to break up with him.
p130
aVBut you don't have to be that jealous
p131
aVto concede that it's hard work. Right?
p132
aVJealousy is exhausting.
p133
aVIt's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd what does jealousy like?
p136
aVJealousy likes information.
p137
aVJealousy likes details.
p138
aVJealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair,
p139
aVthe cute little pencil case.
p140
aVJealousy likes photos.
p141
aVThat's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter)
p142
aVProust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.
p143
aVWhen Swann is in his jealous throes,
p144
aVand suddenly he's listening at doorways
p145
aVand bribing his mistress' servants,
p146
aVhe defends these behaviors.
p147
aVHe says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant,
p148
aVbut it is no different
p149
aVfrom interpreting an ancient text
p150
aVor looking at a monument."
p151
aVHe says, "They are scientific investigations
p152
aVwith real intellectual value."
p153
aVProust is trying to show us that jealousy
p154
aVfeels intolerable and makes us look absurd,
p155
aVbut it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge,
p156
aVa quest for truth, painful truth,
p157
aVand actually, where Proust is concerned,
p158
aVthe more painful the truth, the better.
p159
aVGrief, humiliation, loss:
p160
aVThese were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.
p161
aVHe says, "A woman whom we need,
p162
aVwho makes us suffer, elicits from us
p163
aVa gamut of feelings far more profound and vital
p164
aVthan a man of genius who interests us."
p165
aVIs he telling us to just go and find cruel women?
p166
aVNo. I think he's trying to say
p167
aVthat jealousy reveals us to ourselves.
p168
aVAnd does any other emotion crack us open
p169
aVin this particular way?
p170
aVDoes any other emotion reveal to us
p171
aVour aggression and our hideous ambition
p172
aVand our entitlement?
p173
aVDoes any other emotion teach us to look
p174
aVwith such peculiar intensity?
p175
aa(lp176
VFreud would write about this later.
p177
aVOne day, Freud was visited
p178
aVby this very anxious young man who was consumed
p179
aVwith the thought of his wife cheating on him.
p180
aVAnd Freud says, it's something strange about this guy,
p181
aVbecause he's not looking at what his wife is doing.
p182
aVBecause she's blameless; everybody knows it.
p183
aVThe poor creature is just
p184
aVunder suspicion for no cause.
p185
aVBut he's looking for things that his wife is doing
p186
aVwithout noticing, unintentional behaviors.
p187
aVIs she smiling too brightly here,
p188
aVor did she accidentally brush up against a man there?
p189
aV[Freud] says that the man is becoming
p190
aVthe custodian of his wife's unconscious.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe novel is very good on this point.
p193
aVThe novel is very good at describing how jealousy
p194
aVtrains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.
p195
aVIn fact, the more intensely jealous we are,
p196
aVthe more we become residents of fantasy.
p197
aVAnd this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't
p198
aVjust provoke us to do violent things
p199
aVor illegal things.
p200
aVJealousy prompts us to behave in ways
p201
aVthat are wildly inventive.
p202
aVNow I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede,
p203
aVbut I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.
p204
aVA 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught
p205
aVcreating a fake Facebook account
p206
aVfrom which she sent vile, hideous messages
p207
aVto herself for a year.
p208
aVFor a year. A year.
p209
aVAnd she was trying to frame
p210
aVher ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend,
p211
aVand I have to confess when I heard this,
p212
aVI just reacted with admiration.
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aVBecause, I mean, let's be real.
p215
aVWhat immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right?
p216
aVThis is something from a novel.
p217
aVThis is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.
p220
aVShe is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.
p221
aVShe's the author of "Strangers on a Train"
p222
aVand "The Talented Mr. Ripley,"
p223
aVbooks that are all about how jealousy,
p224
aVit muddles our minds,
p225
aVand once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy,
p226
aVthe membrane between what is and what could be
p227
aVcan be pierced in an instant.
p228
aVTake Tom Ripley, her most famous character.
p229
aVNow, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you
p230
aVor wanting what you have
p231
aVto being you and having what you once had,
p232
aVand you're under the floorboards,
p233
aVhe's answering to your name,
p234
aVhe's wearing your rings,
p235
aVemptying your bank account.
p236
aVThat's one way to go.
p237
aa(lp238
VBut what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route.
p239
aVI can't give the world D's,
p240
aVas much as I would really like to, some days.
p241
aVAnd it's a pity, because we live in envious times.
p242
aVWe live in jealous times.
p243
aVI mean, we're all good citizens of social media,
p244
aVaren't we, where the currency is envy?
p245
aa(lp246
VDoes the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.
p247
aVSo let's do what characters always do when they're not sure,
p248
aVwhen they are in possession of a mystery.
p249
aVLet's go to 221B Baker Street
p250
aVand ask for Sherlock Holmes.
p251
aVWhen people think of Holmes,
p252
aVthey think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty,
p253
aVright, this criminal mastermind.
p254
aVBut I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade,
p255
aVwho is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard
p256
aVwho needs Holmes desperately,
p257
aVneeds Holmes' genius, but resents him.
p258
aVOh, it's so familiar to me.
p259
aVSo Lestrade needs his help, resents him,
p260
aVand sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.
p261
aVBut as they work together, something starts to change,
p262
aVand finally in "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"
p263
aVonce Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution,
p264
aVLestrade turns to Holmes and he says,
p265
aV"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.
p266
aVWe're proud of you."
p267
aVAnd he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard
p268
aVwho wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.
p269
aa(lp270
VIt's one of the few times we see Holmes moved
p271
aVin the mysteries, and I find it very moving,
p272
aVthis little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?
p273
aVIt seems to treat jealousy
p274
aVas a problem of geometry, not emotion.
p275
aVYou know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.
p276
aVThe next minute they're on the same side.
p277
aVSuddenly, Lestrade is letting himself
p278
aVadmire this mind that he's resented.
p279
aVCould it be so simple though?
p280
aVWhat if jealousy really is a matter of geometry,
p281
aVjust a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand
p282
aVin relation to another?
p283
aVWell, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent
p284
aVsomebody's excellence.
p285
aVWe could align ourselves with it.
p286
aa(lp287
VBut I like contingency plans.
p288
aVSo while we wait for that to happen,
p289
aVlet us remember that we have fiction for consolation.
p290
aVFiction alone demystifies jealousy.
p291
aVFiction alone domesticates it,
p292
aVinvites it to the table.
p293
aVAnd look who it gathers:
p294
aVsweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley,
p295
aVcrazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.
p296
aVWe are in excellent company.
p297
aVThank you.
p298
aV(Applause)

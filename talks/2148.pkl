VThank you.
p5
aVI have only got 18 minutes
p6
aVto explain something  that lasts for hours and days,
p7
aVso I'd better get started.
p8
aVLet's start with a clip from Al Jazeera's Listening Post.
p9
aa(lp10
VRichard Gizbert: Norway is a country that  gets relatively little media coverage.
p11
aVEven the elections this past week passed without much drama.
p12
aVAnd that's the Norwegian media in a nutshell:
p13
aVnot much drama.
p14
aVA few years back,
p15
aVNorway's public TV channel NRK
p16
aVdecided to broadcast live coverage of a seven-hour train ride \u2014
p17
aVseven hours of simple footage,
p18
aVa train rolling down the tracks.
p19
aVNorwegians, more than a million of them according to the ratings, loved it.
p20
aVA new kind of reality TV show was born,
p21
aVand it goes against all the rules of TV engagement.
p22
aVThere is no story line, no script,
p23
aVno drama, no climax,
p24
aVand it's called Slow TV.
p25
aVFor the past two months,
p26
aVNorwegians have been watching  a cruise ship's journey up the coast,
p27
aVand there's a lot of fog on that coast.
p28
aVExecutives at Norway's National Broadcasting Service
p29
aVare now considering broadcasting a night of knitting nationwide.
p30
aVOn the surface, it sounds boring,
p31
aVbecause it is,
p32
aVbut something about this TV experiment
p33
aVhas gripped Norwegians.
p34
aVSo we sent the Listening Post's Marcela Pizarro to Oslo
p35
aVto find out what it is, but first a warning:
p36
aVViewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VThomas Hellum: And then follows an eight-minute story on Al Jazeera
p40
aVabout some strange TV programs in little Norway.
p41
aVAl Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there?
p42
aVWe have to go back to 2009,
p43
aVwhen one of my colleagues got a great idea.
p44
aVWhere do you get your ideas?
p45
aVIn the lunchroom.
p46
aVSo he said, why don't we make a radio program
p47
aVmarking the day of the German invasion of Norway in 1940.
p48
aVWe tell the story at the exact time during the night.
p49
aVWow. Brilliant idea, except
p50
aVthis was just a couple of weeks before the invasion day.
p51
aVSo we sat in our lunchroom and discussed
p52
aVwhat other stories can you tell as they evolve?
p53
aVWhat other things take a really long time?
p54
aa(lp55
VSo one of us came up with a train.
p56
aVThe Bergen Railway had its  100-year anniversary that year
p57
aVIt goes from western Norway to eastern Norway,
p58
aVand it takes exactly the same time as it did 40 years ago,
p59
aVover seven hours. (Laughter)
p60
aVSo we caught our commissioning editors  in Oslo, and we said,
p61
aVwe want to make a documentary about the Bergen Railway,
p62
aVand we want to make it in full length,
p63
aVand the answer was,
p64
aV"Yes, but how long will the program be?"
p65
aV"Oh," we said, "full length."
p66
aV"Yes, but we mean the program."
p67
aVAnd back and forth.
p68
aa(lp69
VLuckily for us, they met us with laughter, very, very good laughter,
p70
aVso one bright day in September,
p71
aVwe started a program that we thought should be seven hours and four minutes.
p72
aVActually, it turned out to be seven hours and 14 minutes
p73
aVdue to a signal failure at the last station.
p74
aVWe had four cameras,
p75
aVthree of them pointing out to the beautiful nature.
p76
aVSome talking to the guests, some information.
p77
aV(Video) Train announcement:  We will arrive at Haugastøl Station.
p78
aVTH: And that's about it,
p79
aVbut of course, also
p80
aVthe 160 tunnels gave us the opportunity to do some archives.
p81
aVNarrator [in Norwegian]: Then a bit of flirting while the food is digested.
p82
aVThe last downhill stretch before we reach our destination.
p83
aVWe pass Mjølfjell Station.
p84
aVThen a new tunnel.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVTH: And now we thought, yes, we have a brilliant program.
p87
aVIt will fit for the 2,000 train spotters in Norway.
p88
aVWe brought it on air in November 2009.
p89
aVBut no, this was far more attractive.
p90
aVThis is the five biggest TV channels in Norway on a normal Friday,
p91
aVand if you look at NRK2 over here,
p92
aVlook what happened when they put on the Bergen Railway show:
p93
aV1.2 million Norwegians watched part of this program.
p94
aV(Applause)
p95
aVAnd another funny thing:
p96
aVWhen the host on our main channel,
p97
aVafter they have got news for you,
p98
aVshe said, "And on our second channel,
p99
aVthe train has now nearly reached Myrdal station."
p100
aVThousands of people just jumped on the train
p101
aVon our second channel like this. (Laughter)
p102
aVThis was also a huge success in terms of social media.
p103
aVIt was so nice to see all the thousands of Facebook and Twitter users
p104
aVdiscussing the same view,
p105
aVtalking to each other as if they were on the same train together.
p106
aVAnd especially, I like this one. It's a 76-year-old man.
p107
aVHe's watched all the program,
p108
aVand at the end station, he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage,
p109
aVand his head hit the curtain rod,
p110
aVand he realized he is in his own living room.
p111
aV(Applause)
p112
aa(lp113
VSo that's strong and living TV.
p114
aVFour hundred and thirty-six minute by minute on a Friday night,
p115
aVand during that first night,
p116
aVthe first Twitter message came: Why be a chicken?
p117
aVWhy stop at 436 when you can expand that
p118
aVto 8,040, minute by minute,
p119
aVand do the iconic journey in Norway,
p120
aVthe coastal ship journey Hurtigruten from Bergen to Kirkenes,
p121
aValmost 3,000 kilometers, covering most of our coast.
p122
aVIt has 120-year-old, very interesting history,
p123
aVand literally takes part in life and death along the coast.
p124
aVSo just a week after the Bergen Railway,
p125
aVwe called the Hurtigruten company and we started planning for our next show.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe wanted to do something different.
p128
aVThe Bergen Railway was a recorded program.
p129
aVSo when we sat in our editing room,
p130
aVwe watched this picture \u2014 it's all Ål Station \u2014
p131
aVwe saw this journalist.
p132
aVWe had called him, we had spoken to him,
p133
aVand when we left the station,
p134
aVhe took this picture of us and he waved to the camera,
p135
aVand we thought,
p136
aVwhat if more people knew that we were on board that train?
p137
aVWould more people show up?
p138
aVWhat would it look like?
p139
aVSo we decided our next project, it should be live.
p140
aVWe wanted this picture of us on the fjord and on the screen at the same time.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo this is not the first time NRK had been on board a ship.
p143
aVThis is back in 1964,
p144
aVwhen the technical managers have suits and ties
p145
aVand NRK rolled all its equipment on board a ship,
p146
aVand 200 meters out of the shore, transmitting the signal back,
p147
aVand in the machine room, they talked to the machine guy,
p148
aVand on the deck, they have splendid entertainment.
p149
aVSo being on a ship,  it's not the first time.
p150
aVBut five and a half days in a row, and live, we wanted some help.
p151
aVAnd we asked our viewers out there, what do you want to see?
p152
aVWhat do you want us to film? How do you want this to look?
p153
aVDo you want us to make a website? What do you want on it?
p154
aVAnd we got some answers from you out there,
p155
aVand it helped us a very lot to build the program.
p156
aVSo in June 2011,
p157
aV23 of us went on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship
p158
aVand we set off.
p159
aV(Music)
p160
aa(lp161
VI have some really strong memories from that week, and it's all about people.
p162
aVThis guy, for instance,
p163
aVhe's head of research at the University in Tromsø
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVAnd I will show you a piece of cloth,
p166
aVthis one.
p167
aVIt's the other strong memory.
p168
aVIt belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.
p169
aVAnd it's people like those two who took a firm grip of our program,
p170
aVand together with thousands of others along the route,
p171
aVthey made the program what it became.
p172
aVThey made all the stories.
p173
aVThis is Karl. He's in the ninth grade.
p174
aVIt says, "I will be a little late for school tomorrow."
p175
aVHe was supposed to be in the school at 8 a.m.
p176
aVHe came at 9 a.m., and he didn't get a note from his teacher,
p177
aVbecause the teacher had watched the program.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VHow did we do this?
p181
aVYes, we took a conference room on board the Hurtigruten.
p182
aVWe turned it into a complete TV control room.
p183
aVWe made it all work, of course,
p184
aVand then we took along 11 cameras.
p185
aVThis is one of them.
p186
aVThis is my sketch from February,
p187
aVand when you give this sketch to professional people
p188
aVin the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK,
p189
aVyou get some cool stuff back.
p190
aVAnd with some very creative solutions.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Video) Narrator [in Norwegian]:  Run it up and down.
p193
aVThis is Norway's most important drill right now.
p194
aVIt regulates the height of a bow camera in NRK's live production,
p195
aVone of 11 that capture great shots from the MS Nord-Norge.
p196
aVEight wires keep the camera stable.
p197
aVCameraman: I work  on different camera solutions.
p198
aVThey're just tools used in a different context.
p199
aa(lp200
VTH: Another camera is this one. It's normally used for sports.
p201
aVIt made it possible for us to take close-up pictures of people
p202
aV100 kilomteres away,
p203
aVlike this one. (Laughter)
p204
aVPeople called us and asked, how is this man doing?
p205
aVHe's doing fine. Everything went well.
p206
aVWe also could take pictures of people waving at us,
p207
aVpeople along the route, thousands of them,
p208
aVand they all had a phone in their hand.
p209
aVAnd when you take a picture of them, and they get the message,
p210
aV"Now we are on TV, dad," they start waving back.
p211
aVThis was waving TV  for five and a half days,
p212
aVand people get so extremely happy
p213
aVwhen they can send a warm message to their loved ones.
p214
aa(lp215
VIt was also a great success on social media.
p216
aVOn the last day, we met Her Majesty the Queen of Norway,
p217
aVand Twitter couldn't quite handle it.
p218
aVAnd we also, on the web,
p219
aVduring this week we streamed more than 100 years of video
p220
aVto 148 nations,
p221
aVand the websites are still there and they will be forever, actually,
p222
aVbecause Hurtigruten was selected
p223
aVto be part of the Norwegian UNESCO list of documents,
p224
aVand it's also in the Guinness Book of Records
p225
aVas the longest documentary ever.
p226
aV(Applause)
p227
aVThank you.
p228
aa(lp229
VBut it's a long program,
p230
aVso some watched part of it, like the Prime Minister.
p231
aVSome watched a little bit more.
p232
aVIt says, "I haven't used my bed for five days."
p233
aVAnd he's 82 years old, and he hardly slept.
p234
aVHe kept watching because something might happen,
p235
aVthough it probably won't. (Laughter)
p236
aVThis is the number of viewers along the route.
p237
aVYou can see the famous Trollfjord
p238
aVand a day after, all-time high for NRK2.
p239
aVIf you see the four biggest channels in Norway during June 2011,
p240
aVthey will look like this,
p241
aVand as a TV producer, it's a pleasure to put Hurtigruten on top of it.
p242
aVIt looks like this:
p243
aV3.2 million Norwegians watched part of this program,
p244
aVand we are only five million here.
p245
aVEven the passengers on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship \u2014
p246
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p247
aVthey chose to watched the telly instead of turning 90 degrees
p248
aVand watching out the window.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo we were allowed to be  part of people's living room
p251
aVwith this strange TV program,
p252
aVwith music, nature, people.
p253
aVAnd Slow TV was now a buzzword,
p254
aVand we started looking for other things we could make Slow TV about.
p255
aVSo we could either take something long and make it a topic,
p256
aVlike with the railway and the Hurtigruten,
p257
aVor we could take a topic and make it long.
p258
aVThis is the last project. It's the peep show.
p259
aVIt's 14 hours of birdwatching on a TV screen,
p260
aVactually 87 days on the web.
p261
aVWe have made 18 hours of live salmon fishing.
p262
aVIt actually took three hours before we got the first fish,
p263
aVand that's quite slow.
p264
aVWe have made 12 hours of boat ride into the beautiful Telemark Canal,
p265
aVand we have made another train ride with the northern railway,
p266
aVand because this we couldn't do live, we did it in four seasons
p267
aVjust to give the viewer another experience on the way.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo our next project got us some attention outside Norway.
p270
aVThis is from the Colbert Report on Comedy Central.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Video) Stephen Colbert: I've got my eye on a wildly popular program from Norway
p273
aVcalled "National Firewood Night,"
p274
aVwhich consisted of mostly people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods,
p275
aVand then eight hours of a fire  burning in a fireplace. (Laughter)
p276
aVIt destroyed the other  top Norwegian shows,
p277
aVlike "So You Think You Can Watch Paint Dry"
p278
aVand "The Amazing Glacier Race."
p279
aVAnd get this, almost 20 percent of the Norwegian population tuned in,
p280
aV20 percent.
p281
aa(lp282
VTH: So, when wood fire and wood chopping can be that interesting,
p283
aVwhy not knitting?
p284
aVSo on our next project,
p285
aVwe used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater,
p286
aVand Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show,
p287
aVhe liked that.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Music)
p290
aa(lp291
V(Video) Jimmy Kimmel: Even the people on the show are falling asleep,
p292
aVand after all that, the knitters actually failed
p293
aVto break the world record.
p294
aVThey did not succeed,
p295
aVbut remember the old Norwegian saying,
p296
aVit's not whether you win or lose that counts.
p297
aVIn fact, nothing counts,  and death is coming for us all.
p298
aV(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VTH: Exactly. So why does this stand out?
p301
aVThis is so completely different to other TV programming.
p302
aVWe take the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time,
p303
aVand the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there,
p304
aVactually being on the train, on the boat,
p305
aVand knitting together with others,
p306
aVand the reason I think why they're doing that
p307
aVis because we don't edit the timeline.
p308
aVIt's important that we don't edit the timeline,
p309
aVand it's also important that what we make Slow TV about
p310
aVis something that we all can relate to, that the viewer can relate to,
p311
aVand that somehow has  a root in our culture.
p312
aVThis is a picture from last summer
p313
aVwhen we traveled the coast again for seven weeks.
p314
aVAnd of course this is a lot of planning, this is a lot of logistics.
p315
aVSo this is the working plan for 150 people last summer,
p316
aVbut more important is what you don't plan.
p317
aVYou don't plan what's going to happen.
p318
aVYou have to just take your cameras with you.
p319
aVIt's like a sports event.
p320
aVYou rig them and you see what's happening.
p321
aVSo this is actually the whole running order
p322
aVfor Hurtigruten, 134 hours, just written on one page.
p323
aVWe didn't know anything more when we left Bergen.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo you have to let the viewers make the stories themselves,
p326
aVand I'll give you an example of that.
p327
aVThis is from last summer,
p328
aVand as a TV producer,
p329
aVit's a nice picture, but now you can cut to the next one.
p330
aVBut this is Slow TV,
p331
aVso you have to keep this picture until  it really starts hurting your stomach,
p332
aVand then you keep it a little bit longer,
p333
aVand when you keep it that long,
p334
aVI'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow.
p335
aVSome of you have seen the flag.
p336
aVSome of you start wondering, is the farmer at home?
p337
aVHas he left? Is he watching the cow?
p338
aVAnd where is that cow going?
p339
aVSo my point is, the longer you keep a picture like this,
p340
aVand we kept it for 10 minutes,
p341
aVyou start making the stories in your own head.
p342
aVThat's Slow TV.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo we think that Slow TV is one nice way of telling a TV story,
p345
aVand we think that we can continue doing it,
p346
aVnot too often, once or twice a year, so we keep the feeling of an event,
p347
aVand we also think that the good Slow TV idea,
p348
aVthat's the idea when people say,
p349
aV"Oh no, you can't put that on TV."
p350
aVWhen people smile, it might be a very good slow idea,
p351
aVso after all, life is best when it's a bit strange.
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you.

The former lighting designer moved into photography and then began work as a producer, specializing in documentaries.

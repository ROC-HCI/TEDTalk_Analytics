VMy story actually began when I was four years old
p5
aVand my family moved to a new neighborhood
p6
aVin our hometown of Savannah, Georgia.
p7
aVAnd this was the 1960s
p8
aVwhen actually all the streets in this neighborhood
p9
aVwere named after Confederate war generals.
p10
aVWe lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard.
p11
aVAnd when I was five,
p12
aVmy parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle.
p13
aVIt had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars
p14
aVthat made the rider look like an orangutan.
p15
aVThat's why they were called ape hangers.
p16
aVThey were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s,
p17
aVwhich I'm sure my mom didn't know.
p18
aVAnd one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac
p19
aVhidden away a few streets away.
p20
aVAnd I came back,
p21
aVand I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly,
p22
aVso I decided to turn around in this big street
p23
aVthat intersected our neighborhood,
p24
aVand wham! I was hit by a passing sedan.
p25
aVMy mangled body flew in one direction,
p26
aVmy mangled bike flew in the other.
p27
aVAnd I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line,
p28
aVand one of my neighbors came running over.
p29
aV"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?" she said, using the name of my older brother.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aV"I'm Bruce," I said, and promptly passed out.
p32
aa(lp33
VI broke my left femur that day \u2014
p34
aVit's the largest bone in your body \u2014
p35
aVand spent the next two months in a body cast
p36
aVthat went from my chin to the tip of my toe
p37
aVto my right knee,
p38
aVand a steel bar went from my right knee
p39
aVto my left ankle.
p40
aVAnd for the next 38 years,
p41
aVthat accident was the only medically interesting thing
p42
aVthat ever happened to me.
p43
aVIn fact, I made a living by walking.
p44
aVI traveled around the world, entered different cultures,
p45
aVwrote a series of books about my travels,
p46
aVincluding "Walking the Bible."
p47
aVI hosted a television show by that name
p48
aVon PBS.
p49
aVI was, for all the world, the "walking guy."
p50
aVUntil, in May 2008,
p51
aVa routine visit to my doctor
p52
aVand a routine blood test
p53
aVproduced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number
p54
aVthat something might be wrong with my bones.
p55
aVAnd my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan,
p56
aVwhich showed that there was some growth in my left leg.
p57
aVThat sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI.
p58
aVAnd one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor.
p59
aV"The tumor in your leg
p60
aVis not consistent with a benign tumor."
p61
aVI stopped walking,
p62
aVand it took my mind a second to convert that double negative
p63
aVinto a much more horrifying negative.
p64
aVI have cancer.
p65
aVAnd to think that the tumor was in the same bone,
p66
aVin the same place in my body
p67
aVas the accident 38 years earlier \u2014
p68
aVit seemed like too much of a coincidence.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo that afternoon, I went back to my house,
p71
aVand my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler,
p72
aVcame running to meet me.
p73
aVThey'd just turned three,
p74
aVand they were into all things pink and purple.
p75
aVIn fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious \u2014
p76
aValthough I must say, our favorite nickname
p77
aVoccurred on their birthday, April 15th.
p78
aVWhen they were born at 6:14 and 6:46
p79
aVon April 15, 2005,
p80
aVour otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch,
p81
aVand was like, "Hmm, April 15th \u2014 tax day.
p82
aVEarly filer and late filer."
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVThe next day I came to see him. I was like, "Doctor, that was a really good joke."
p85
aVAnd he was like, "You're the writer, kid."
p86
aVAnyway \u2014 so they had just turned three,
p87
aVand they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up
p88
aVwhere they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground,
p89
aVlaughing with all the glee in the world.
p90
aVI crumbled.
p91
aVI kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them,
p92
aVthe art projects I might not mess up,
p93
aVthe boyfriends I might not scowl at,
p94
aVthe aisles I might not walk down.
p95
aVWould they wonder who I was, I thought.
p96
aVWould they yearn for my approval,
p97
aVmy love, my voice?
p98
aa(lp99
VA few days later, I woke with an idea
p100
aVof how I might give them that voice.
p101
aVI would reach out to six men
p102
aVfrom all parts of my life
p103
aVand ask them to be present
p104
aVin the passages of my daughters' lives.
p105
aV"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives,"
p106
aVI wrote these men.
p107
aV"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes,
p108
aVbut they may not have me.
p109
aVThey may not have their dad.
p110
aVWill you help be their dad?"
p111
aVAnd I said to myself
p112
aVI would call this group of men "the Council of Dads."
p113
aa(lp114
VNow as soon as I had this idea,
p115
aVI decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay.
p116
aVShe's a very upbeat,
p117
aVnaturally excited person.
p118
aVThere's this idea in this culture \u2014 I don't have to tell you \u2014
p119
aVthat you sort of "happy" your way through a problem.
p120
aVWe should focus on the positive.
p121
aVMy wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston.
p122
aVShe's got a big smile. She's got a big personality.
p123
aVShe's got big hair \u2014
p124
aValthough, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair,
p125
aVbecause if I say she has big hair,
p126
aVpeople will think she's from Texas.
p127
aVAnd it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia,
p128
aVbut not to have hair from Texas.
p129
aVAnd actually, in her defense, if she were here right now,
p130
aVshe would point out that, when we got married in Georgia,
p131
aVthere were three questions
p132
aVon the marriage certificate license,
p133
aVthe third of which was, "Are you related?"
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVI said, "Look, in Georgia at least we want to know.
p136
aVIn Arkansas they don't even ask."
p137
aVWhat I didn't tell her is, if she said, "Yes," you could jump.
p138
aVYou don't need the 30-day waiting period.
p139
aVBecause you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo I wasn't going to tell her about this idea,
p142
aVbut the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her.
p143
aVAnd she loved the idea,
p144
aVbut she quickly started rejecting my nominees.
p145
aVShe was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice."
p146
aVSo it turned out that starting a council of dads
p147
aVwas a very efficient way to find out
p148
aVwhat my wife really thought of my friends.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VSo we decided that we needed a set of rules,
p153
aVand we came up with a number.
p154
aVAnd the first one was no family, only friends.
p155
aVWe thought our family would already be there.
p156
aVSecond, men only.
p157
aVWe were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives.
p158
aVAnd then third, sort of a dad for every side.
p159
aVWe kind of went through my personality
p160
aVand tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.
p161
aVSo what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.
p162
aVAnd rather than send it,
p163
aVI decided to read it to them in person.
p164
aVLinda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals.
p165
aVI sort of friend-married each of these guys.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin.
p168
aVNow Jeff led this trip I took to Europe
p169
aVwhen I graduated from high school in the early 1980s.
p170
aVAnd on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle.
p171
aVAnd I snuck out behind,
p172
aVand there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows.
p173
aVAnd Jeff came up beside me and said,
p174
aV"So, have you ever been cow tipping?"
p175
aVI was like, "Cow tipping?
p176
aVHe was like, "Yeah. Cows sleep standing up.
p177
aVSo if you approach them from behind, down wind,
p178
aVyou can push them over and they go thud in the mud."
p179
aVSo before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not,
p180
aVwe had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence,
p181
aVwe were tiptoeing through the dung
p182
aVand approaching some poor, dozing cow.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo a few weeks after my diagnosis,
p185
aVwe went up to Vermont,
p186
aVand I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads.
p187
aVAnd we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter.
p188
aV"Will you help be their dad?"
p189
aVAnd I got to the end \u2014 he was crying and I was crying \u2014
p190
aVand then he looked at me, and he said, "Yes."
p191
aVI was like, "Yes?"
p192
aVI kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter.
p193
aVAnd frankly, although I keep getting asked this,
p194
aVit never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down
p195
aVunder the circumstances.
p196
aVAnd then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads
p197
aVand ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book.
p198
aVAnd that was, "What's the one piece of advice
p199
aVyou would give to my girls?"
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd Jeff's advice was,
p202
aV"Be a traveller, not a tourist.
p203
aVGet off the bus. Seek out what's different.
p204
aVApproach the cow."
p205
aV"So it's 10 years from now," I said,
p206
aV"and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here.
p207
aVWhat would you tell them?"
p208
aVHe said, "I would approach this journey
p209
aVas a young child might approach a mud puddle.
p210
aVYou can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror
p211
aVand maybe run your finger and make a small ripple,
p212
aVor you can jump in and thrash around
p213
aVand see what it feels like, what it smells like."
p214
aVAnd as he talked he had that glint in his eye
p215
aVthat I first saw back in Holland \u2014
p216
aVthe glint that says, "Let's go cow tipping,"
p217
aVeven though we never did tip the cow,
p218
aVeven though no one tips the cow,
p219
aVeven though cows don't sleep standing up.
p220
aVHe said, "I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience,
p221
aVcovered in mud."
p222
aa(lp223
VTwo weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed
p224
aVI had a seven-inch osteosarcoma
p225
aVin my left femur.
p226
aVSix hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma.
p227
aVEighty-five percent are under 21.
p228
aVOnly a hundred adults a year
p229
aVget one of these diseases.
p230
aVTwenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped,
p231
aVand there was a 15 percent survival rate.
p232
aVAnd then in the 1980's, they determined
p233
aVthat one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective,
p234
aVand within weeks I had started that regimen.
p235
aVAnd since we are in a medical room,
p236
aVI went through four and a half months of chemo.
p237
aVActually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin
p238
aVand very high-dose Methotrexate.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd then I had a 15-hour surgery
p241
aVin which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey
p242
aVat Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York,
p243
aVtook out my left femur
p244
aVand replaced it with titanium.
p245
aVAnd if you did see the Sanjay special,
p246
aVyou saw these enormous screws
p247
aVthat they screwed into my pelvis.
p248
aVThen he took my fibula from my calf,
p249
aVcut it out and then relocated it to my thigh,
p250
aVwhere it now lives.
p251
aVAnd what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf
p252
aVand re-vascularized it in my thigh
p253
aVand then connected it
p254
aVto the good parts of my knee and my hip.
p255
aVAnd then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle.
p256
aVThis is a surgery so rare
p257
aVonly two human beings have survived it before me.
p258
aVAnd my reward for surviving it
p259
aVwas to go back for four more months of chemo.
p260
aVIt was, as we said in my house,
p261
aVa lost year.
p262
aa(lp263
VBecause in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares.
p264
aVAnd one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house,
p265
aVsat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children
p266
aVsitting on my desk.
p267
aVAnd I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of \u2014
p268
aVI don't know where you are Dr. Nuland \u2014
p269
aVof William Sloane Coffin \u2014
p270
aVit made me think of it.
p271
aVBecause I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo
p272
aVwhen my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system.
p273
aVAnd they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital.
p274
aVAnd anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask
p275
aVand cover all of the extraneous parts of their body.
p276
aVAnd one night I got a call from my mother-in-law
p277
aVthat my daughters, at that time three and a half,
p278
aVwere missing me and feeling my absence.
p279
aVAnd I hung up the phone,
p280
aVand I put my face in my hands,
p281
aVand I screamed this silent scream.
p282
aVAnd what you said, Dr. Nuland \u2014 I don't know where you are \u2014
p283
aVmade me think of this today.
p284
aVBecause the thought that came to my mind
p285
aVwas that the feeling that I had
p286
aVwas like a primal scream.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd what was so striking \u2014
p289
aVand one of the messages I want to leave you here with today \u2014
p290
aVis the experience.
p291
aVAs I became less and less human \u2014
p292
aVand at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now.
p293
aVOf course, I had no hair and no immune system.
p294
aVThey were actually putting blood inside my body.
p295
aVAt that moment I was less and less human,
p296
aVI was also, at the same time,
p297
aVmaybe the most human I've ever been.
p298
aVAnd what was so striking about that time
p299
aVwas, instead of repulsing people,
p300
aVI was actually proving to be a magnet for people.
p301
aVPeople were incredibly drawn.
p302
aVWhen my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck.
p303
aVInstead, it was everybody running the other way.
p304
aVAnd when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way.
p305
aVInstead, it was all-hands-on-deck.
p306
aVAnd when people came to me,
p307
aVrather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw \u2014
p308
aVI was like a living ghost \u2014
p309
aVthey were incredibly moved
p310
aVto talk about what was going on in their own lives.
p311
aa(lp312
VCancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy.
p313
aVIt is an invitation, maybe even a mandate,
p314
aVto enter the most vital arenas of human life,
p315
aVthe most sensitive and the most frightening,
p316
aVthe ones that we never want to go to,
p317
aVbut when we do go there,
p318
aVwe feel incredibly transformed when we do.
p319
aVAnd this also happened to my girls as they began to see,
p320
aVand, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate.
p321
aVOne day, my daughter Tybee,
p322
aVTybee came to me, and she said, "I have so much love for you in my body, daddy,
p323
aVI can't stop giving you hugs and kisses.
p324
aVAnd when I have no more love left, I just drink milk,
p325
aVbecause that's where love comes from."
p326
aV(Laughter)
p327
aVAnd one night my daughter Eden came to me.
p328
aVAnd as I lifted my leg out of bed,
p329
aVshe reached for my crutches and handed them to me.
p330
aVIn fact, if I cling to one memory of this year,
p331
aVit would be walking down a darkened hallway
p332
aVwith five spongy fingers
p333
aVgrasping the handle underneath my hand.
p334
aVI didn't need the crutch anymore,
p335
aVI was walking on air.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd one of the profound things that happened
p338
aVwas this act of actually connecting to all these people.
p339
aVAnd it made me think \u2014 and I'll just note for the record \u2014
p340
aVone word that I've only heard once actually
p341
aVwas when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday \u2014
p342
aVthe one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually
p343
aVis the word "friend."
p344
aVAnd yet from everything we've been talking about \u2014
p345
aVcompliance, or addiction, or weight loss \u2014
p346
aVwe now know that community is important,
p347
aVand yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in.
p348
aVAnd there was something incredibly profound
p349
aVabout sitting down with my closest friends
p350
aVand telling them what they meant to me.
p351
aVAnd one of the things that I learned is that over time,
p352
aVparticularly men, who used to be non-communicative,
p353
aVare becoming more and more communicative.
p354
aVAnd that particularly happened \u2014 there was one in my life \u2014
p355
aVis this Council of Dads
p356
aVthat Linda said, what we were talking about,
p357
aVit's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd no one captures this modern manhood to me
p360
aVmore than David Black.
p361
aVNow David is my literary agent.
p362
aVHe's about five-foot three and a half on a good day,
p363
aVstanding fully upright in cowboy boots.
p364
aVAnd on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone \u2014
p365
aVI can say this I guess because you've done it here \u2014
p366
aVhe answers the phone, "Yo, motherfucker."
p367
aVHe gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine,
p368
aVand on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car \u2014
p369
aValthough, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th.
p370
aVBut like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes,
p371
aVhe leaves work early to coach Little League.
p372
aVSomeone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads.
p373
aVI was like, "David cries when you invite him to take a walk."
p374
aV(Laughter)
p375
aVBut he's a literary agent,
p376
aVwhich means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true.
p377
aVAnd this is what we wanted him to capture \u2014
p378
aVwhat it means to have setbacks and then aspirations.
p379
aVAnd I said, "What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?"
p380
aVAnd he said, "A belief in themselves."
p381
aV"But when I came to see you," I said, "I didn't believe in myself.
p382
aVI was at a wall."
p383
aVHe said, "I don't see the wall," and I'm telling you the same,
p384
aVDon't see the wall.
p385
aVYou may encounter one from time to time,
p386
aVbut you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it.
p387
aVBut whatever you do, don't succumb to it.
p388
aVDon't give in to the wall.
p389
aa(lp390
VMy home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge,
p391
aVand during the year and a half I was on crutches,
p392
aVit became a sort of symbol to me.
p393
aVSo one day near the end of my journey,
p394
aVI said, "Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge."
p395
aVWe set out on crutches.
p396
aVI was on crutches, my wife was next to me,
p397
aVmy girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead.
p398
aVAnd because walking was one of the first things I lost,
p399
aVI spent most of that year
p400
aVthinking about this most elemental of human acts.
p401
aVWalking upright, we are told,
p402
aVis the threshold of what made us human.
p403
aVAnd yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright,
p404
aVthe act is essentially unchanged.
p405
aVAs my physical therapist likes to say,
p406
aV"Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen."
p407
aVYou nearly fall with one leg,
p408
aVthen you catch yourself with the other.
p409
aVAnd the biggest consequence of walking on crutches \u2014
p410
aVas I did for a year and a half \u2014
p411
aVis that you walk slower.
p412
aVYou hurry,
p413
aVyou get where you're going, but you get there alone.
p414
aVYou go slow, you get where you're going,
p415
aVbut you get there with this community
p416
aVyou built along the way.
p417
aa(lp418
VAt the risk of admission, I was never nicer
p419
aVthan the year I was on crutches.
p420
aV200 years ago,
p421
aVa new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris.
p422
aVHe was called a "flaneur," one who wanders the arcades.
p423
aVAnd it was the custom of those flaneurs
p424
aVto show they were men of leisure
p425
aVby taking turtles for walks
p426
aVand letting the reptile set the pace.
p427
aVAnd I just love this ode to slow moving.
p428
aVAnd it's become my own motto for my girls.
p429
aVTake a walk with a turtle.
p430
aVBehold the world in pause.
p431
aVAnd this idea of pausing
p432
aVmay be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey.
p433
aa(lp434
VThere's a quote from Moses
p435
aVon the side of the Liberty Bell,
p436
aVand it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus,
p437
aVthat every seven years you should let the land lay fallow.
p438
aVAnd every seven sets of seven years,
p439
aVthe land gets an extra year of rest
p440
aVduring which time all families are reunited
p441
aVand people surrounded with the ones they love.
p442
aVThat 50th year is called the jubilee year,
p443
aVand it's the origin of that term.
p444
aVAnd though I'm shy of 50,
p445
aVit captures my own experience.
p446
aVMy lost year was my jubilee year.
p447
aVBy laying fallow,
p448
aVI planted the seeds for a healthier future
p449
aVand was reunited with the ones I love.
p450
aa(lp451
VCome the one year anniversary of my journey,
p452
aVI went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey \u2014
p453
aVand by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor.
p454
aVHe's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage,
p455
aVwhich is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard.
p456
aVAnd I said, "Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day
p457
aVand say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?'
p458
aVwhat would you tell them?"
p459
aVHe said, "I would tell them what I know,
p460
aVand that is everybody dies,
p461
aVbut not everybody lives.
p462
aVI want you to live."
p463
aa(lp464
VI wrote a letter to my girls
p465
aVthat appears at the end of my book, "The Council of Dads,"
p466
aVand I listed these lessons,
p467
aVa few of which you've heard here today:
p468
aVApproach the cow, pack your flipflops,
p469
aVdon't see the wall,
p470
aVlive the questions,
p471
aVharvest miracles.
p472
aVAs I looked at this list \u2014 to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living \u2014
p473
aVI realized, we may have done it for our girls,
p474
aVbut it really changed us.
p475
aVAnd that is, the secret of the Council of Dads,
p476
aVis that my wife and I did this
p477
aVin an attempt to help our daughters,
p478
aVbut it really changed us.
p479
aa(lp480
VSo I stand here today
p481
aVas you see now, walking without crutches or a cane.
p482
aVAnd last week I had my 18-month scans.
p483
aVAnd as you all know,
p484
aVanybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans.
p485
aVIn my case it's quarterly.
p486
aVAnd all the collective minds in this room, I dare say,
p487
aVcan never find a solution for scan-xiety.
p488
aVAs I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say
p489
aVdepending on what happened here.
p490
aVI got good news that day,
p491
aVand I stand here today cancer-free,
p492
aVwalking without aid
p493
aVand hobbling forward.
p494
aa(lp495
VAnd I just want to mention briefly in passing \u2014 I'm past my time limit \u2014
p496
aVbut I just want to briefly mention in passing
p497
aVthat one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this
p498
aVis, at a similar meeting,
p499
aVback in the spring,
p500
aVAnne Wojcicki heard about our story
p501
aVand very quickly \u2014 in a span of three weeks \u2014
p502
aVput the full resources of 23andMe,
p503
aVand we announced an initiative in July
p504
aVto get to decode the genome
p505
aVof anybody, a living person
p506
aVwith a heart tissue, bone sarcoma.
p507
aVAnd she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it,
p508
aVwe've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program.
p509
aVAnd the epidemiologists here will tell you,
p510
aVthat's half the number of people who get the disease
p511
aVin one year in the United States.
p512
aVSo if you go to 23andMe,
p513
aVor if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link.
p514
aVAnd we encourage anybody to join this effort.
p515
aa(lp516
VBut I'll just close what I've been talking about
p517
aVby leaving you with this message:
p518
aVMay you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal,
p519
aVor to that college roommate,
p520
aVor to some person you may have turned away from.
p521
aVMay you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace,
p522
aVor find a way to get over, around, or through any wall
p523
aVthat stands between you and one of your dreams.
p524
aVAnd every now and then,
p525
aVfind a friend, find a turtle,
p526
aVand take a long, slow walk.
p527
aa(lp528
VThank you very much.

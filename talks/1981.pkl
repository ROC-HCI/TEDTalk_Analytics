VScientific breakthrough,
p5
aVthe kind that can potentially save lives,
p6
aVcan sometimes be lying right out in the open
p7
aVfor us to discover,
p8
aVin the evolved, accumulated body
p9
aVof human anecdote, for example,
p10
aVor in the time-tested adaptations
p11
aVthat we observe in the natural world around us.
p12
aVScience starts with observation,
p13
aVbut the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures
p14
aVthat we might otherwise dismiss
p15
aVas myth or coincidence,
p16
aVisolate them, and test them with scientific rigor.
p17
aVAnd when we do, the results will often surprise.
p18
aa(lp19
VWestern Australia has had a particular problem
p20
aVwith shark attacks over the last three years,
p21
aVunfortunately and tragically culminating
p22
aVin five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period
p23
aVduring that time.
p24
aVBut Western Australia is not alone in this.
p25
aVThe incident of shark engagements on humans
p26
aVis escalating worldwide.
p27
aVAnd so it's not surprising, perhaps,
p28
aVthat in July of this year,
p29
aVShark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration
p30
aVwith the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute
p31
aVmade an announcement which captured the attention
p32
aVof the worldwide media and of ocean users
p33
aVworldwide,
p34
aVand that was around the development of technology
p35
aVto mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack
p36
aVbased on the science of what sharks can see.
p37
aVAnd I have for you today
p38
aVthe story of that journey,
p39
aVbut also the notion that science can be
p40
aVas powerful as a translator
p41
aVas it can be for invention.
p42
aa(lp43
VWhen we began this process,
p44
aVwe were looking, it was about three years ago,
p45
aVand we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks
p46
aVin Western Australia,
p47
aVand by chance, in a previous role,
p48
aVI happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler.
p49
aVNow Harry Butler, who most Australians would know is a famous naturalist,
p50
aVhad spent a lot of time in the marine environment.
p51
aVHarry Butler is a precursor, if you like,
p52
aVto the late Steve Irwin.
p53
aVWhen I asked him about
p54
aVwhat the solution to the problem might be,
p55
aVthe answer was quite surprising.
p56
aVHe said, "Take a black wetsuit,
p57
aVband it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee,
p58
aVand you'll be mimicking the warning systems
p59
aVof most marine species."
p60
aVI didn't think about that much at the time,
p61
aVand it wasn't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened,
p62
aVand it caused me to think,
p63
aVmaybe there's some merit to this idea.
p64
aVAnd I turned to the web
p65
aVto see if there might be some clues.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd it turns out the web is awash
p68
aVwith this sort of evidence that supports
p69
aVthis sort of thinking.
p70
aVSo biologically, there are plenty of species
p71
aVthat display banding or patterns, warning patterns,
p72
aVto either be cryptical in the water
p73
aVor warn against being attacked,
p74
aVnot the least of which is the pilot fish
p75
aVwhich spends a big slab of its life
p76
aVaround the business end of a shark.
p77
aVOn the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer,
p78
aVhas been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s,
p79
aVand anthropologically,
p80
aVPacific island tribes painted themselves in bands
p81
aVin a sea snake ceremony
p82
aVto ward off the shark god.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo what's going on here?
p85
aVIs this an idea lying wide out in the open
p86
aVfor us to consider and define?
p87
aVWe know that sharks use a range of sensors
p88
aVwhen they engage, particularly for attack,
p89
aVbut the sight sensor is the one that they use
p90
aVto identify the target, and particularly
p91
aVin the last number of meters before the attack.
p92
aVIt makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote
p93
aVbecause that's time-tested evolution
p94
aVover many millennia.
p95
aVBut isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts,
p96
aVthe idea that there's a kernel of truth
p97
aVthought to be important,
p98
aVpassed down from generation to generation,
p99
aVso that it actually ends up shaping human behavior?
p100
aa(lp101
VI wanted to test this idea.
p102
aVI wanted to put some science
p103
aVto this anecdotal evidence,
p104
aVbecause if science could support this concept,
p105
aVthen we might have at least part of the solution
p106
aVto shark attack right under our very nose.
p107
aVTo do that, I needed some experts
p108
aVin shark vision and shark neurology,
p109
aVand a worldwide search, again,
p110
aVled to the University of W.A.
p111
aVon the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute.
p112
aVAnd professor Nathan Hart and his team
p113
aVhad just written a paper which tells us,
p114
aVconfirms that predatory sharks see
p115
aVin black and white, or grayscale.
p116
aVSo I called up Nathan,
p117
aVa little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea
p118
aVthat maybe we could use these patterns and shapes
p119
aVto produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack,
p120
aVand fortunately, he thought that was a good idea.
p121
aVSo what ensued is a collaborative bit of research
p122
aVsupported by the West Australian State Government.
p123
aVAnd we did three key things.
p124
aVThe first is that we mapped the characteristics,
p125
aVthe physical characteristics of the eyes
p126
aVof the three main predatory sharks,
p127
aVso the great white, tiger and bull shark.
p128
aVWe did that genetically
p129
aVand we did that anatomically.
p130
aVThe next thing we did was to understand,
p131
aVusing complex computer modeling,
p132
aVwhat that eye can see
p133
aVat different depths, distances,
p134
aVlight conditions, and water clarity in the ocean.
p135
aVAnd from there, we were able to pinpoint
p136
aVtwo key characteristics:
p137
aVwhat patterns and shapes would present the wearer
p138
aVas hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic,
p139
aVand what patterns and shapes might provide
p140
aVthe greatest contrast but provide the greatest
p141
aVbreakup of profile
p142
aVso that that person wasn't confused for shark prey
p143
aVor shark food.
p144
aa(lp145
VThe next thing we needed to do was to convert this
p146
aVinto wetsuits that people might actually wear,
p147
aVand to that end, I invited Ray Smith,
p148
aVa surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer,
p149
aVand in fact the guy that designed the original Quiksilver logo,
p150
aVto come over and sit with the science team
p151
aVand interpret that science
p152
aVinto aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear.
p153
aVAnd here's an example of one of the first drawings.
p154
aVSo this is what I call a "don't eat me" wetsuit.
p155
aVSo this takes that banding idea,
p156
aVtakes that banding idea, it's highly visible,
p157
aVprovides a highly disruptive profile,
p158
aVand is intended to prevent the shark
p159
aVfrom considering that you would be ordinary food,
p160
aVand potentially even create confusion for the shark.
p161
aVAnd this one's configured to go with a surfboard.
p162
aVYou can see that dark, opaque panel on the front,
p163
aVand it's particularly better for the surface,
p164
aVwhere being backlit and providing a silhouette
p165
aVis problematic.
p166
aVSecond iteration is the cryptic wetsuit,
p167
aVor the one which attempts to hide the wearer
p168
aVin the water column.
p169
aVThere are three panels on this suit,
p170
aVand in any given conditions,
p171
aVone or more of those panels
p172
aVwill match the reflective spectra of the water
p173
aVso as to disappear fully or partially,
p174
aVleaving the last panel or panels
p175
aVto create a disruptive profile in the water column.
p176
aVAnd this one's particularly well-suited
p177
aVto the dive configuration,
p178
aVso when you're deeper under the water.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo we knew that we had
p181
aVsome really solid science here.
p182
aVWe knew, if you wanted to stand out,
p183
aVyou needed to look stripy,
p184
aVand we knew if you wanted to be cryptic,
p185
aVyou needed to look like this.
p186
aVBut the acid test is always going to be,
p187
aVhow would sharks really behave
p188
aVin the context of these patterns and shapes.
p189
aVAnd testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit
p190
aVin the water with a predatory shark
p191
aVin a natural environment
p192
aVis actually a lot harder than you might think.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VSo we have to bait the rig,
p196
aVbecause we need to get the statistical number
p197
aVof samples through to get the scientific evidence,
p198
aVand by baiting the rig,
p199
aVwe're obviously changing shark behavior.
p200
aVWe can't put humans in the water.
p201
aVWe're ethically precluded from even using
p202
aVhumanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water.
p203
aVBut nevertheless, we started the testing process
p204
aVin January of this year,
p205
aVinitially with tiger sharks
p206
aVand subsequently with great white sharks.
p207
aVThe way we did that
p208
aVwas to get a perforated drum which is full of bait,
p209
aVwrap it in a neoprene skin,
p210
aVand then run two stereo underwater cameras
p211
aVto watch how the shark actually engages with that rig.
p212
aVAnd because we use stereo,
p213
aVwe can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is,
p214
aVwhat angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves,
p215
aVand what its behavior is
p216
aVin an empirical rather than a subjective way.
p217
aVBecause we needed to preserve the scientific method,
p218
aVwe ran a control rig
p219
aVwhich was a black neoprene rig
p220
aVjust like a normal black wetsuit
p221
aVagainst the, what we call,
p222
aVSAMS technology rig.
p223
aVAnd the results were not just exciting,
p224
aVbut very encouraging,
p225
aVand today I would like to just give you a snapshot
p226
aVof two of those engagements.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo here we've got a four-meter tiger shark
p229
aVengaging the black control rig,
p230
aVwhich it had encountered about
p231
aVa minute and a half before.
p232
aVNow that exact same shark had engaged,
p233
aVor encountered this SAMS rig,
p234
aVwhich is the Elude SAMS rig,
p235
aVabout eight minutes before,
p236
aVand spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it,
p237
aVlooking for what it could smell and sense but not see,
p238
aVand this was the final engagement.
p239
aVGreat white sharks are more confident than the tigers,
p240
aVand here you see great white shark
p241
aVengaging a control rig,
p242
aVso a black neoprene wetsuit,
p243
aVand going straight to the bottom,
p244
aVcoming up
p245
aVand engaging.
p246
aVIn contrast to the SAMS technology rig,
p247
aVthis is the banded one,
p248
aVwhere it's more tactile,
p249
aVit's more investigative,
p250
aVit's more apprehensive,
p251
aVand shows a reluctance to come straight in and go.
p252
aV(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VSo, it's important for us that all  the testing is done independently,
p255
aVand the University of W.A. is doing the testing.
p256
aVIt'll be an ongoing process.
p257
aVIt's subject to peer review and subject to publication.
p258
aVIt's so important that this concept
p259
aVis led with the science.
p260
aVFrom the perspective of Shark  Attack Mitigation Systems,
p261
aVwe're a biotechnology licensing company,
p262
aVso we don't make wetsuits ourselves.
p263
aVWe'll license others to do that.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut I thought you might be interested
p266
aVin seeing what SAMS technology looks like
p267
aVembedded in a wetsuit, and to that end,
p268
aVfor the first time, live, worldwide \u2014
p269
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p270
aVI can show you what biological adaptation,
p271
aVscience and design looks like in real life.
p272
aVSo I can welcome Sam, the surfer,
p273
aVfrom this side. Where are you, Sam?
p274
aV(Applause)
p275
aVAnd Eduardo.
p276
aV(Applause)
p277
aVCheers, mate.
p278
aVCheers.
p279
aVThanks, gentlemen. (Applause)
p280
aa(lp281
VSo what have we done here?
p282
aVWell, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet
p283
aVand use science as a tool for invention,
p284
aVwe've paid attention to the biological evidence,
p285
aVwe've put importance to the
p286
aVhuman anecdotal evidence,
p287
aVand we've used science as a tool
p288
aVfor translation,
p289
aVtranslation of something that was already there
p290
aVinto something that we can  use for the benefit of mankind.
p291
aVAnd it strikes me that this idea of science
p292
aVas a tool for translation rather than invention
p293
aVis one that we can apply much more widely than this
p294
aVin the pursuit of innovation.
p295
aVAfter all, did the Wright brothers
p296
aVdiscover manned flight,
p297
aVor did they observe the biological fact of flight
p298
aVand translate that mechanically, replicate it
p299
aVin a way that humans could use?
p300
aVAs for the humble wetsuit,
p301
aVwho knows what oceanwear will look like
p302
aVin two years' time, in five years' time
p303
aVor in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking,
p304
aVI'm guessing there's a fair chance
p305
aVit won't be pure black.
p306
aa(lp307
VThank you.

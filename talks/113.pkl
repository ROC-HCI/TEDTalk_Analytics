VThat splendid music, the coming-in music,
p5
aV"The Elephant March" from "Aida," is the music I've chosen for my funeral.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd you can see why. It's triumphal.
p10
aVI won't feel anything, but if I could,
p11
aVI would feel triumphal at having lived at all,
p12
aVand at having lived on this splendid planet,
p13
aVand having been given the opportunity to understand
p14
aVsomething about why I was here in the first place, before not being here.
p15
aa(lp16
VCan you understand my quaint English accent?
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VLike everybody else, I was entranced yesterday by the animal session.
p21
aVRobert Full and Frans Lanting and others;
p22
aVthe beauty of the things that they showed.
p23
aVThe only slight jarring note was when Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang,
p24
aV"the most splendid creatures that God put on this earth."
p25
aVNow of course, we know that he didn't really mean that,
p26
aVbut in this country at the moment, you can't be too careful.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VI'm a biologist, and the central theorem of our subject: the theory of design,
p31
aVDarwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.
p32
aVIn professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted.
p33
aVIn non-professional circles outside America, it's largely ignored.
p34
aVBut in non-professional circles within America,
p35
aVit arouses so much hostility \u2014
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
Vit's fair to say that American biologists are in a state of war.
p40
aVThe war is so worrying at present,
p41
aVwith court cases coming up in one state after another,
p42
aVthat I felt I had to say something about it.
p43
aa(lp44
VIf you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself,
p45
aVI'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books,
p46
aVwhich you won't find in the bookstore outside.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VContemporary court cases
p51
aVoften concern an allegedly new version of creationism,
p52
aVcalled "Intelligent Design," or ID.
p53
aVDon't be fooled. There's nothing new about ID.
p54
aVIt's just creationism under another name,
p55
aVrechristened \u2014 I choose the word advisedly \u2014
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
Vfor tactical, political reasons.
p60
aa(lp61
VThe arguments of so-called ID theorists
p62
aVare the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again,
p63
aVsince Darwin down to the present day.
p64
aVThere is an effective evolution lobby
p65
aVcoordinating the fight on behalf of science,
p66
aVand I try to do all I can to help them,
p67
aVbut they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention
p68
aVthat we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists.
p69
aVThey see us as rocking the boat, and you can understand why.
p70
aVCreationists, lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case,
p71
aVfall back on the popular phobia against atheism:
p72
aVTeach your children evolution in biology class,
p73
aVand they'll soon move on to drugs, grand larceny and sexual "pre-version."
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VIn fact, of course, educated theologians from the Pope down
p78
aVare firm in their support of evolution.
p79
aVThis book, "Finding Darwin's God," by Kenneth Miller,
p80
aVis one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design that I know
p81
aVand it's all the more effective because it's written by a devout Christian.
p82
aVPeople like Kenneth Miller could be called a "godsend" to the evolution lobby,
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
Vbecause they expose the lie that evolutionism is, as a matter of fact,
p87
aVtantamount to atheism.
p88
aVPeople like me, on the other hand, rock the boat.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut here, I want to say something nice about creationists.
p91
aVIt's not a thing I often do, so listen carefully.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VI think they're right about one thing.
p96
aVI think they're right that evolution
p97
aVis fundamentally hostile to religion.
p98
aa(lp99
VI've already said that many individual evolutionists, like the Pope,
p100
aVare also religious, but I think they're deluding themselves.
p101
aVI believe a true understanding of Darwinism
p102
aVis deeply corrosive to religious faith.
p103
aVNow, it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism,
p104
aVand I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do.
p105
aVIn an audience as sophisticated as this one,
p106
aVthat would be preaching to the choir.
p107
aa(lp108
VNo, what I want to urge upon you \u2014
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VInstead, what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
V(Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VBut that's putting it too negatively.
p119
aVIf I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith,
p120
aVI would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science,
p121
aVand indeed science generally, but evolution in particular,
p122
aVto inspire and enthrall, precisely because it is atheistic.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, the difficult problem for any theory of biological design
p125
aVis to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things.
p126
aVStatistical improbability in the direction of good design \u2014
p127
aV"complexity" is another word for this.
p128
aVThe standard creationist argument \u2014
p129
aVthere is only one; they're all reduced to this one \u2014
p130
aVtakes off from a statistical improbability.
p131
aVLiving creatures are too complex to have come about by chance;
p132
aVtherefore, they must have had a designer.
p133
aVThis argument of course, shoots itself in the foot.
p134
aVAny designer capable of designing something really complex
p135
aVhas to be even more complex himself,
p136
aVand that's before we even start on the other things he's expected to do,
p137
aVlike forgive sins, bless marriages, listen to prayers \u2014
p138
aVfavor our side in a war \u2014
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
Vdisapprove of our sex lives, and so on.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VComplexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve,
p147
aVand you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex,
p148
aVthereby simply compounding the problem.
p149
aVDarwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant
p150
aVbecause it solves the problem of explaining complexity
p151
aVin terms of nothing but simplicity.
p152
aVEssentially, it does it by providing a smooth ramp
p153
aVof gradual, step-by-step increment.
p154
aVBut here, I only want to make the point
p155
aVthat the elegance of Darwinism is corrosive to religion,
p156
aVprecisely because it is so elegant, so parsimonious, so powerful,
p157
aVso economically powerful.
p158
aVIt has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge.
p159
aa(lp160
VThe God theory is not just a bad theory.
p161
aVIt turns out to be \u2014 in principle \u2014
p162
aVincapable of doing the job required of it.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo, returning to tactics and the evolution lobby,
p165
aVI want to argue that rocking the boat
p166
aVmay be just the right thing to do.
p167
aVMy approach to attacking creationism is \u2014
p168
aVunlike the evolution lobby \u2014
p169
aVmy approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole.
p170
aVAnd at this point I need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo
p171
aVagainst speaking ill of religion,
p172
aVand I'm going to do so in the words of the late Douglas Adams,
p173
aVa dear friend who, if he never came to TED,
p174
aVcertainly should have been invited.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.)
p177
aa(lp178
VRichard Dawkins: He was. Good. I thought he must have been.
p179
aa(lp180
VHe begins this speech, which was tape recorded in Cambridge
p181
aVshortly before he died \u2014
p182
aVhe begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses
p183
aVthat are framed to be vulnerable to disproof, and then he goes on.
p184
aa(lp185
VI quote, "Religion doesn't seem to work like that.
p186
aVIt has certain ideas at the heart of it, which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.'
p187
aVWhat it means is: here is an idea or a notion
p188
aVthat you're not allowed to say anything bad about.
p189
aVYou're just not. Why not? Because you're not."
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
V"Why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate
p194
aVto support the Republicans or Democrats,
p195
aVthis model of economics versus that,
p196
aVMacintosh instead of Windows,
p197
aVbut to have an opinion about how the universe began,
p198
aVabout who created the universe \u2014
p199
aVno, that's holy.
p200
aVSo, we're used to not challenging religious ideas,
p201
aVand it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates
p202
aVwhen he does it." \u2014
p203
aa(lp204
VHe meant me, not that one.
p205
aa(lp206
V"Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it,
p207
aVbecause you're not allowed to say these things.
p208
aVYet when you look at it rationally,
p209
aVthere's no reason why those ideas
p210
aVshouldn't be as open to debate as any other,
p211
aVexcept that we've agreed somehow between us
p212
aVthat they shouldn't be."
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd that's the end of the quote from Douglas.
p215
aa(lp216
VIn my view, not only is science corrosive to religion;
p217
aVreligion is corrosive to science.
p218
aVIt teaches people to be satisfied with trivial,
p219
aVsupernatural non-explanations,
p220
aVand blinds them to the wonderful, real explanations
p221
aVthat we have within our grasp.
p222
aVIt teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith,
p223
aVinstead of always insisting on evidence.
p224
aa(lp225
VThere's Douglas Adams, magnificent picture from his book, "Last Chance to See."
p226
aVNow, there's a typical scientific journal,
p227
aVThe Quarterly Review of Biology.
p228
aVAnd I'm going to put together, as guest editor,
p229
aVa special issue on the question, "Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?"
p230
aVAnd the first paper is a standard scientific paper,
p231
aVpresenting evidence,
p232
aV"Iridium layer at the K-T boundary,
p233
aVand potassium argon dated crater in Yucatan,
p234
aVindicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."
p235
aVPerfectly ordinary scientific paper.
p236
aVNow, the next one.
p237
aV"The President of the Royal Society
p238
aVhas been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction
p239
aVthat an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
V"It has been privately revealed to Professor Huxtane
p244
aa(lp245
Vthat an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
V"Professor Hordley was brought up
p250
aVto have total and unquestioning faith" \u2014
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter) \u2014
p253
aa(lp254
V"that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."
p255
aV"Professor Hawkins has promulgated an official dogma
p256
aVbinding on all loyal Hawkinsians
p257
aVthat an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VThat's inconceivable, of course.
p262
aa(lp263
VBut suppose \u2014
p264
aa(lp265
V[Supporters of the Asteroid Theory cannot be patriotic citizens]
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
V(Applause)
p270
aa(lp271
VIn 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr.
p272
aVwhether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism
p273
aVof Americans who are atheists.
p274
aVMr. Bush's reply has become infamous.
p275
aV"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered citizens,
p276
aVnor should they be considered patriots.
p277
aVThis is one nation under God."
p278
aa(lp279
VBush's bigotry was not an isolated mistake,
p280
aVblurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted.
p281
aVHe stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal.
p282
aVHe really meant it.
p283
aVMore to the point, he knew it posed no threat to his election \u2014
p284
aVquite the contrary.
p285
aVDemocrats as well as Republicans parade their religiousness
p286
aVif they want to get elected.
p287
aVBoth parties invoke "one nation under God."
p288
aVWhat would Thomas Jefferson have said?
p289
aa(lp290
V[In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty]
p291
aa(lp292
VIncidentally, I'm not usually very proud of being British,
p293
aVbut you can't help making the comparison.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Applause)
p296
aa(lp297
VIn practice, what is an atheist?
p298
aVAn atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh
p299
aVthe way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.
p300
aVAs has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods
p301
aVthat humanity has ever believed in.
p302
aVSome of us just go one god further.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
V(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd however we define atheism, it's surely the kind of academic belief
p309
aVthat a person is entitled to hold without being vilified
p310
aVas an unpatriotic, unelectable non-citizen.
p311
aVNevertheless, it's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist
p312
aVis tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub.
p313
aVAnd that all stems from the perception of atheists
p314
aVas some kind of weird, way-out minority.
p315
aa(lp316
VNatalie Angier wrote a rather sad piece in the New Yorker,
p317
aVsaying how lonely she felt as an atheist.
p318
aVShe clearly feels in a beleaguered minority.
p319
aVBut actually, how do American atheists stack up numerically?
p320
aVThe latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading.
p321
aVChristianity, of course, takes a massive lion's share of the population,
p322
aVwith nearly 160 million.
p323
aVBut what would you think was the second largest group,
p324
aVconvincingly outnumbering Jews with 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million,
p325
aVHindus, Buddhists and all other religions put together?
p326
aVThe second largest group, with nearly 30 million,
p327
aVis the one described as non-religious or secular.
p328
aa(lp329
VYou can't help wondering why vote-seeking politicians
p330
aVare so proverbially overawed by the power of, for example, the Jewish lobby \u2014
p331
aVthe state of Israel seems to owe its very existence to the American Jewish vote \u2014
p332
aVwhile at the same time,
p333
aVconsigning the non-religious to political oblivion.
p334
aVThis secular non-religious vote, if properly mobilized,
p335
aVis nine times as numerous as the Jewish vote.
p336
aVWhy does this far more substantial minority
p337
aVnot make a move to exercise its political muscle?
p338
aa(lp339
VWell, so much for quantity. How about quality?
p340
aVIs there any correlation, positive or negative,
p341
aVbetween intelligence and tendency to be religious?
p342
aa(lp343
V[Them folks misunderestimated me]
p344
aa(lp345
V(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VThe survey that I quoted, which is the ARIS survey,
p348
aVdidn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education,
p349
aVIQ or anything else.
p350
aVBut a recent article by Paul G. Bell in the Mensa magazine
p351
aVprovides some straws in the wind.
p352
aVMensa, as you know, is an international organization
p353
aVfor people with very high IQ.
p354
aVAnd from a meta-analysis of the literature,
p355
aVBell concludes that, I quote \u2014 "Of 43 studies carried out since 1927
p356
aVon the relationship between religious belief,
p357
aVand one's intelligence or educational level,
p358
aVall but four found an inverse connection.
p359
aVThat is, the higher one's intelligence or educational level,
p360
aVthe less one is likely to be religious."
p361
aVWell, I haven't seen the original 42 studies,
p362
aVand I can't comment on that meta-analysis,
p363
aVbut I would like to see more studies done along those lines.
p364
aVAnd I know that there are \u2014 if I could put a little plug here \u2014
p365
aVthere are people in this audience
p366
aVeasily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question,
p367
aVand I put the suggestion up, for what it's worth.
p368
aa(lp369
VBut let me know show you some data
p370
aVthat have been properly published and analyzed,
p371
aVon one special group \u2014 namely, top scientists.
p372
aVIn 1998, Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists,
p373
aVthose who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences,
p374
aVand among this select group,
p375
aVbelief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent.
p376
aVAbout 20 percent are agnostic; the rest could fairly be called atheists.
p377
aVSimilar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality.
p378
aVAmong biological scientists, the figure is even lower:
p379
aV5.5 percent, only, believe in God.
p380
aVPhysical scientists, it's 7.5 percent.
p381
aVI've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars
p382
aVin other fields, such as history or philosophy,
p383
aVbut I'd be surprised if they were different.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo, we've reached a truly remarkable situation,
p386
aVa grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia
p387
aVand the American electorate.
p388
aVA philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe,
p389
aVwhich is held by the vast majority of top American scientists
p390
aVand probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally,
p391
aVis so abhorrent to the American electorate
p392
aVthat no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public.
p393
aVIf I'm right, this means that high office
p394
aVin the greatest country in the world
p395
aVis barred to the very people best qualified to hold it \u2014
p396
aVthe intelligentsia \u2014
p397
aVunless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs.
p398
aVTo put it bluntly: American political opportunities
p399
aVare heavily loaded against those
p400
aVwho are simultaneously intelligent and honest.
p401
aa(lp402
V(Laughter)
p403
aa(lp404
V(Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VI'm not a citizen of this country, so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming
p407
aVif I suggest that something needs to be done.
p408
aa(lp409
V(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VAnd I've already hinted what that something is.
p412
aVFrom what I've seen of TED, I think this may be the ideal place to launch it.
p413
aVAgain, I fear it will cost money.
p414
aVWe need a consciousness-raising,
p415
aVcoming-out campaign for American atheists.
p416
aa(lp417
V(Laughter)
p418
aa(lp419
VThis could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals
p420
aVa few years ago,
p421
aValthough heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing
p422
aVof people against their will.
p423
aVIn most cases, people who out themselves
p424
aVwill help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists.
p425
aa(lp426
VOn the contrary,
p427
aVthey'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people
p428
aVwho could serve as decent role models for your children,
p429
aVthe kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product,
p430
aVthe kinds of people who are sitting in this room.
p431
aVThere should be a snowball effect, a positive feedback,
p432
aVsuch that the more names we have, the more we get.
p433
aVThere could be non-linearities, threshold effects.
p434
aVWhen a critical mass has been obtained,
p435
aVthere's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment.
p436
aVAnd again, it will need money.
p437
aa(lp438
VI suspect that the word "atheist" itself
p439
aVcontains or remains a stumbling block
p440
aVfar out of proportion to what it actually means,
p441
aVand a stumbling block to people
p442
aVwho otherwise might be happy to out themselves.
p443
aVSo, what other words might be used to smooth the path,
p444
aVoil the wheels, sugar the pill?
p445
aVDarwin himself preferred "agnostic" \u2014
p446
aVand not only out of loyalty to his friend Huxley,
p447
aVwho coined the term.
p448
aa(lp449
VDarwin said, "I have never been an atheist
p450
aVin the same sense of denying the existence of a God.
p451
aVI think that generally an 'agnostic'
p452
aVwould be the most correct description of my state of mind."
p453
aa(lp454
VHe even became uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling.
p455
aVAveling was a militant atheist
p456
aVwho failed to persuade Darwin
p457
aVto accept the dedication of his book on atheism \u2014
p458
aVincidentally, giving rise to a fascinating myth
p459
aVthat Karl Marx tried to dedicate "Das Kapital" to Darwin,
p460
aVwhich he didn't, it was actually Edward Aveling.
p461
aVWhat happened was that Aveling's mistress was Marx's daughter,
p462
aVand when both Darwin and Marx were dead,
p463
aVMarx's papers became muddled up with Aveling's papers,
p464
aVand a letter from Darwin saying, "My dear sir, thank you very much
p465
aVbut I don't want you to dedicate your book to me,"
p466
aVwas mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx,
p467
aVand that gave rise to this whole myth, which you've probably heard.
p468
aVIt's a sort of urban myth, that Marx tried to dedicate "Kapital" to Darwin.

VAnyway, it was Aveling, and when they met, Darwin challenged Aveling.
p471
aV"Why do you call yourselves atheists?"
p472
aV"'Agnostic, '" retorted Aveling, "was simply 'atheist' writ respectable,
p473
aVand 'atheist' was simply 'agnostic' writ aggressive."
p474
aVDarwin complained, "But why should you be so aggressive?"
p475
aVDarwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia,
p476
aVbut that ordinary people were not, quote, "ripe for it."
p477
aVWhich is, of course, our old friend, the "don't rock the boat" argument.
p478
aVIt's not recorded whether Aveling told Darwin to come down off his high horse.
p479
aa(lp480
V(Laughter)
p481
aa(lp482
VBut in any case, that was more than 100 years ago.
p483
aVYou'd think we might have grown up since then.
p484
aVNow, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew,
p485
aVwho, incidentally, observes the Sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity,
p486
aVdescribes himself as a "tooth-fairy agnostic."
p487
aVHe won't call himself an atheist
p488
aVbecause it's, in principle, impossible to prove a negative,
p489
aVbut "agnostic" on its own might suggest that God's existence
p490
aVwas therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non-existence.
p491
aa(lp492
VSo, my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy,
p493
aVbut it isn't very likely, is it?
p494
aVLike God.
p495
aVHence the phrase, "tooth-fairy agnostic."
p496
aVBertrand Russell made the same point
p497
aVusing a hypothetical teapot in orbit about Mars.
p498
aVYou would strictly have to be agnostic
p499
aVabout whether there is a teapot in orbit about Mars,
p500
aVbut that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence
p501
aVas on all fours with its non-existence.
p502
aa(lp503
VThe list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about
p504
aVdoesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots; it's infinite.
p505
aVIf you want to believe one particular one of them \u2014
p506
aVunicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or Yahweh \u2014
p507
aVthe onus is on you to say why.
p508
aVThe onus is not on the rest of us to say why not.
p509
aVWe, who are atheists,
p510
aVare also a-fairyists and a-teapotists.
p511
aa(lp512
V(Laughter)
p513
aa(lp514
VBut we don't bother to say so.
p515
aVAnd this is why my friend uses "tooth-fairy agnostic"
p516
aVas a label for what most people would call atheist.
p517
aVNonetheless, if we want to attract deep-down atheists to come out publicly,
p518
aVwe're going to have find something better to stick on our banner
p519
aVthan "tooth-fairy" or "teapot agnostic."
p520
aa(lp521
VSo, how about "humanist"?
p522
aVThis has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations
p523
aVand journals and things already in place.
p524
aVMy problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism.
p525
aVOne of the things we've learned from Darwin
p526
aVis that the human species is only one
p527
aVamong millions of cousins, some close, some distant.
p528
aa(lp529
VAnd there are other possibilities, like "naturalist,"
p530
aVbut that also has problems of confusion,
p531
aVbecause Darwin would have thought naturalist \u2014
p532
aV"Naturalist" means, of course, as opposed to "supernaturalist" \u2014
p533
aVand it is used sometimes \u2014
p534
aVDarwin would have been confused by the other sense of "naturalist,"
p535
aVwhich he was, of course,
p536
aVand I suppose there might be others who would confuse it with "nudism".
p537
aa(lp538
V(Laughter)
p539
aa(lp540
VSuch people might be those belonging to the British lynch mob,
p541
aVwhich last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile.
p542
aa(lp543
V(Laughter)
p544
aa(lp545
VI think the best of the available alternatives for "atheist"
p546
aVis simply "non-theist."
p547
aVIt lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no God,
p548
aVand it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics.
p549
aVIt's completely compatible with the God of the physicists.
p550
aVWhen atheists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word "God,"
p551
aVthey use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand
p552
aVfor that deep, mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand.
p553
aV"Non-theist" will do for all that, yet unlike "atheist,"
p554
aVit doesn't have the same phobic, hysterical responses.
p555
aVBut I think, actually, the alternative
p556
aVis to grasp the nettle of the word "atheism" itself,
p557
aVprecisely because it is a taboo word,
p558
aVcarrying frissons of hysterical phobia.
p559
aVCritical mass may be harder to achieve with the word "atheist"
p560
aVthan with the word "non-theist,"
p561
aVor some other non-confrontational word.
p562
aVBut if we did achieve it with that dread word "atheist" itself,
p563
aVthe political impact would be even greater.
p564
aa(lp565
VNow, I said that if I were religious, I'd be very afraid of evolution \u2014
p566
aVI'd go further: I would fear science in general, if properly understood.
p567
aVAnd this is because the scientific worldview
p568
aVis so much more exciting, more poetic,
p569
aVmore filled with sheer wonder
p570
aVthan anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination.
p571
aVAs Carl Sagan, another recently dead hero, put it,
p572
aV"How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science
p573
aVand concluded, 'This is better than we thought!
p574
aVThe universe is much bigger than our prophet said,
p575
aVgrander, more subtle, more elegant'?
p576
aVInstead they say, 'No, no, no!
p577
aVMy god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.'
p578
aVA religion, old or new,
p579
aVthat stressed the magnificence of the universe
p580
aVas revealed by modern science,
p581
aVmight be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe
p582
aVhardly tapped by the conventional faiths."
p583
aa(lp584
VNow, this is an elite audience,
p585
aVand I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious.
p586
aVMany of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief
p587
aVthat we should respect religion.
p588
aVBut I also suspect that a fair number of those
p589
aVsecretly despise religion as much as I do.
p590
aa(lp591
V(Laughter)
p592
aa(lp593
VIf you're one of them, and of course many of you may not be,
p594
aVbut if you are one of them,
p595
aVI'm asking you to stop being polite,
p596
aVcome out, and say so.
p597
aVAnd if you happen to be rich,
p598
aVgive some thought to ways in which you might make a difference.
p599
aVThe religious lobby in this country
p600
aVis massively financed by foundations \u2014 to say nothing of all the tax benefits \u2014
p601
aVby foundations, such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute.
p602
aVWe need an anti-Templeton to step forward.
p603
aVIf my books sold as well as Stephen Hawking's books,
p604
aVinstead of only as well as Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself.
p605
aa(lp606
VPeople are always going on about, "How did September the 11th change you?"
p607
aa(lp608
VWell, here's how it changed me.
p609
aa(lp610
VLet's all stop being so damned respectful.
p611
aa(lp612
VThank you very much.
p613
aa(lp614
V(Applause)

He&#39;s best-known for the ideas laid out in his landmark book <a href=\\"http://geni.us/selfishgene\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Selfish Gene</em></a>  and fleshed out in <a href=\\"http://geni.us/extendedphenotype\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Extended Phenotype</em></a>: the rather radical notion that <strong>Darwinian selection happens not at the level of the individual, but at the level of our DNA</strong>. The implication: We evolved for only one purpose &mdash; to serve our genes.<br /><br />Of perhaps equal importance is Dawkins&#39; concept of the <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme\\" target=\\"_blank\\">meme</a>, which he defines as a self-replicating unit of culture -- an idea, a chain letter, a catchy tune, an urban legend -- which is passed person-to-person, its longevity based on its ability to lodge in the brain and inspire transmission to others. Introduced in <em>The Selfish Gene</em> in 1976, <strong>the concept of memes has itself proven highly contagious, inspiring countless accounts and explanations of idea propagation</strong> in the information age.<br /><br />In recent years, <strong>Dawkins has become outspoken in his atheism</strong>, coining the word &quot;bright&quot; (as an alternate to atheist), and encouraging fellow non-believers to stand up and be identified. His controversial, confrontational 2002 TED talk was a seminal moment for the New Atheism, as was the publication of his 2006 book, <em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/goddelusion\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The God Delusion</a>,</em> a bestselling critique of religion that championed atheism and promoted scientific principles over creationism and intelligent design.</p>", "slug": "richard_dawkins", "whotheyare": "Oxford professor Richard Dawkins has helped steer evolutionary science into the 21st century, and his concept of the \\"meme\\" contextualized the spread of ideas in the information age.

understand complex scientific concepts. He&#39;s best-known for the ideas laid out in his landmark book <a href=\\"http://geni.us/selfishgene\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Selfish Gene</em></a>  and fleshed out in <a href=\\"http://geni.us/extendedphenotype\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Extended Phenotype</em></a>: the rather radical notion that <strong>Darwinian selection happens not at the level of the individual, but at the level of our DNA</strong>. The implication: We evolved for only one purpose &mdash; to serve our genes.<br /><br />Of perhaps equal importance is Dawkins&#39; concept of the <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme\\" target=\\"_blank\\">meme</a>, which he defines as a self-replicating unit of culture -- an idea, a chain letter, a catchy tune, an urban legend -- which is passed person-to-person, its longevity based on its ability to lodge in the brain and inspire transmission to others. Introduced in <em>The Selfish Gene</em> in 1976, <strong>the concept of memes has itself proven highly contagious, inspiring countless accounts and explanations of idea propagation</strong> in the information age.<br /><br />In recent years, <strong>Dawkins has become outspoken in his atheism</strong>, coining the word &quot;bright&quot; (as an alternate to atheist), and encouraging fellow non-believers to stand up and be identified. His controversial, confrontational 2002 TED talk was a seminal moment for the New Atheism, as was the publication of his 2006 book, <em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/goddelusion\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The God Delusion</a>,</em> a bestselling critique of religion that championed atheism and promoted scientific principles over creationism and intelligent design.</p>", "slug": "richard_dawkins", "whotheyare": "Oxford professor Richard Dawkins has helped steer evolutionary science into the 21st century, and his concept of the \\"meme\\" contextualized the spread of ideas in the information age.

VI was born in Switzerland
p5
aVand raised in Ghana, West Africa.
p6
aVGhana felt safe to me as a child.
p7
aVI was free, I was happy.
p8
aVThe early 70s
p9
aVmarked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.
p10
aVBut then by the end of the decade,
p11
aVthe country had fallen back into political instability
p12
aVand mismanagement.
p13
aa(lp14
VIn 1979,
p15
aVI witnessed my first military coup.
p16
aVWe the children had gathered at a friend's house.
p17
aVIt was a dimly lit shack.
p18
aVThere was a beaten up black and white television
p19
aVflickering in the background,
p20
aVand a former head of state and general
p21
aVwas being blindfolded
p22
aVand tied to the pole.
p23
aVThe firing squad aimed, fired \u2014
p24
aVthe general was dead.
p25
aVNow this was being broadcast live.
p26
aVAnd shortly after, we left the country,
p27
aVand we returned to Switzerland.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow Europe came as a shock to me,
p30
aVand I think I started feeling the need
p31
aVto shed my skin in order to fit in.
p32
aVI wanted to blend in like a chameleon.
p33
aVI think it was a tactic of survival.
p34
aVAnd it worked, or so I believed.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo here I was in 2008
p37
aVwondering where I was in my life.
p38
aVAnd I felt I was being typecast as an actor.
p39
aVI was always playing the exotic African.
p40
aVI was playing the violent African,
p41
aVthe African terrorist.
p42
aVAnd I was thinking,
p43
aVhow many terrorists could I possibly play
p44
aVbefore turning into one myself?
p45
aVAnd I had become ashamed of the other,
p46
aVthe African in me.
p47
aVAnd fortunately I decided in 2008
p48
aVto return to Ghana,
p49
aVafter 28 years of absence.
p50
aVI wanted to document on film
p51
aVthe 2008 presidential elections.
p52
aVAnd there, I started by searching
p53
aVfor the footprints in my childhood.
p54
aVAnd before I even knew it,
p55
aVI was suddenly on a stage
p56
aVsurrounded by thousands of cheering people
p57
aVduring a political rally.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd I realized that, when I'd left the country,
p60
aVfree and fair elections in a democratic environment
p61
aVwere a dream.
p62
aVAnd now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality,
p63
aVthough a fragile reality.
p64
aVAnd I was thinking,
p65
aVwas Ghana searching for its identity
p66
aVlike I was looking for my identity?
p67
aVWas what was happening in Ghana a metaphor
p68
aVfor what was happening in me?
p69
aVAnd it was as if through the standards of my Western life,
p70
aVI hadn't lived up to my full potential.
p71
aVI mean, nor had Ghana,
p72
aVeven though we had been trying very hard.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow in 1957,
p75
aVGhana was the first sub-Saharan country
p76
aVto gain its independence.
p77
aVIn the late 50s,
p78
aVGhana and Singapore had the same GDP.
p79
aVI mean, today, Singapore is a First World country
p80
aVand Ghana is not.
p81
aVBut maybe it was time to prove to myself,
p82
aVyes, it's important to understand the past,
p83
aVit is important to look at it in a different light,
p84
aVbut maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture
p85
aVand build on those foundations in the present.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo here I was, December 7th, 2008.
p88
aVThe polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 AM,
p89
aVbut voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands,
p90
aVwere starting to line up at 4:00 AM in the morning.
p91
aVAnd they had traveled from near, they had traveled from far,
p92
aVbecause they wanted to make their voices heard.
p93
aVAnd I asked one of the voters, I said, "Whom are you going to vote for?"
p94
aVAnd he said, "I'm sorry, I can't tell you."
p95
aVHe said that his vote was in his heart.
p96
aVAnd I understood, this was their election,
p97
aVand they weren't going to let anyone
p98
aVtake it away from them.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner \u2014
p101
aVso nobody had achieved the absolute majority \u2014
p102
aVso voting went into a second round three weeks later.
p103
aVThe candidates were back on the road; they were campaigning.
p104
aVThe rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.
p105
aVThe heat was on.
p106
aVAnd then the cliche came to haunt us.
p107
aVThere were claims of intimidation
p108
aVat the polling stations,
p109
aVof ballot boxes being stolen.
p110
aVInflated results started coming in
p111
aVand the mob was starting to get out of control.
p112
aVWe witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.
p113
aVPeople were being beaten brutally.
p114
aVThe army started firing their guns. People were scrambling.
p115
aVIt was complete chaos.
p116
aVAnd my heart sank,
p117
aVbecause I thought, here we are again.
p118
aVHere is another proof
p119
aVthat the African is not capable of governing himself.
p120
aVAnd not only that, I am documenting it \u2014
p121
aVdocumenting my own cultural shortcomings.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo when the echo of the gunshots
p124
aVhad lingered,
p125
aVit was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob,
p126
aVand I didn't believe what I was hearing.
p127
aVThey were chanting, "We want peace.
p128
aVWe want peace."
p129
aVAnd I realized it had to come from the people.
p130
aVAfter all, they decide,
p131
aVand they did.
p132
aVSo the sounds that were before distorted and loud,
p133
aVwere suddenly a melody.
p134
aVThe sounds of the voices were harmonious.
p135
aVSo it could happen.
p136
aVA democracy could be upheld peacefully.
p137
aVIt could be, by the will of the masses
p138
aVwho were now urgently pressing
p139
aVwith all their heart and all their will
p140
aVfor peace.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow here's an interesting comparison.
p143
aVWe in the West,
p144
aVwe preach the values,
p145
aVthe golden light of democracy,
p146
aVthat we are the shining example of how it's done.
p147
aVBut when it comes down to it,
p148
aVGhana found itself in the same place
p149
aVin which the U.S. election stalled
p150
aVin the 2000 presidential elections \u2014
p151
aVBush versus Gore.
p152
aVBut instead of the unwillingness of the candidates
p153
aVto allow the system to proceed and the people to decide,
p154
aVGhana honored democracy
p155
aVand its people.
p156
aVIt didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide;
p157
aVthe people did.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow the second round of voting
p160
aVdid not bring forth a clear winner either.
p161
aVI mean, it was so incredibly close.
p162
aVThe electoral commissioner declared,
p163
aVwith the consent of the parties,
p164
aVto run an unprecedented
p165
aVsecond re-run.
p166
aVSo the people went back to the polls
p167
aVto determine their own president,
p168
aVnot the legal system.
p169
aVAnd guess what, it worked.
p170
aVThe defeated candidate
p171
aVgave up power
p172
aVand made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.
p173
aVI mean, at the absolute time
p174
aVfor the absolute need of democracy,
p175
aVthey did not abuse their power.
p176
aVThe belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep,
p177
aVproving that the African is capable of governing himself.
p178
aa(lp179
VNow the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa
p180
aVis not over,
p181
aVbut I have proof that the other side of democracy exists,
p182
aVand that we must not take it for granted.
p183
aVNow I have learned
p184
aVthat my place is not just in the West or in Africa,
p185
aVand I'm still searching
p186
aVfor my identity,
p187
aVbut I saw Ghana
p188
aVcreate democracy better.
p189
aVGhana taught me
p190
aVto look at people differently
p191
aVand to look at myself differently.
p192
aVAnd yes,
p193
aVwe Africans can.
p194
aa(lp195
VThank you.

VSo today I'm going to talk to you
p5
aVabout the rise of collaborative consumption.
p6
aVI'm going to explain what it is
p7
aVand try and convince you \u2014 in just 15 minutes \u2014
p8
aVthat this isn't a flimsy idea,
p9
aVor a short-term trend,
p10
aVbut a powerful cultural and economic force
p11
aVreinventing not just what we consume,
p12
aVbut how we consume.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example.
p15
aVHands up \u2014 how many of you
p16
aVhave books, CDs, DVDs, or videos
p17
aVlying around your house
p18
aVthat you probably won't use again,
p19
aVbut you can't quite bring yourself to throw away?
p20
aVCan't see all the hands,
p21
aVbut it looks like all of you, right?
p22
aVOn our shelves at home,
p23
aVwe have a box set of the DVD series "24,"
p24
aVseason six to be precise.
p25
aVI think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.
p26
aVNow my husband, Chris, and I
p27
aVlove this show.
p28
aVBut let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice,
p29
aVyou don't really want to watch it again,
p30
aVbecause you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.
p31
aVSo there it sits on our shelves
p32
aVobsolete to us,
p33
aVbut with immediate latent value to someone else.
p34
aVNow before we go on, I have a confession to make.
p35
aVI lived in New York for 10 years,
p36
aVand I am a big fan of "Sex and the City."
p37
aVNow I'd love to watch the first movie again
p38
aVas sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week.
p39
aVSo how easily could I swap
p40
aVour unwanted copy of "24"
p41
aVfor a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?"
p42
aVNow you may have noticed
p43
aVthere's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.
p44
aVNow the easiest analogy for swap-trading
p45
aVis like an online dating service
p46
aVfor all your unwanted media.
p47
aVWhat it does is use the Internet
p48
aVto create an infinite marketplace
p49
aVto match person A's "haves"
p50
aVwith person C's "wants,"
p51
aVwhatever they may be.
p52
aa(lp53
VThe other week, I went on one of these sites,
p54
aVappropriately called Swaptree,
p55
aVand there were over 59,300 items
p56
aVthat I could instantly swap
p57
aVfor my copy of "24."
p58
aVLo and behold,
p59
aVthere in Reseda, CA was Rondoron
p60
aVwho wanted swap his or her
p61
aV"like new" copy of "Sex and the City"
p62
aVfor my copy of "24."
p63
aVSo in other words, what's happening here
p64
aVis that Swaptree
p65
aVsolves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,
p66
aVa problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants,"
p67
aVin approximately 60 seconds.
p68
aVWhat's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,
p69
aVbecause it knows the way of the item.
p70
aVNow there are layers of technical wonder
p71
aVbehind sites such as Swaptree,
p72
aVbut that's not my interest,
p73
aVand nor is swap trading, per se.
p74
aa(lp75
VMy passion, and what I've spent the last few years
p76
aVdedicated to researching,
p77
aVis the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics
p78
aVinherent in these systems.
p79
aVWhen you think about it,
p80
aVit would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,
p81
aVthat I would swap my stuff with a total stranger
p82
aVwhose real name I didn't know
p83
aVand without any money changing hands.
p84
aVYet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree
p85
aVhappen successfully,
p86
aVand the one percent that receive a negative rating,
p87
aVit's for relatively minor reasons,
p88
aVlike the item didn't arrive on time.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo what's happening here?
p91
aVAn extremely powerful dynamic
p92
aVthat has huge commercial and cultural implications
p93
aVis at play.
p94
aVNamely, that technology
p95
aVis enabling
p96
aVtrust between strangers.
p97
aVWe now live in a global village
p98
aVwhere we can mimic the ties
p99
aVthat used to happen face to face,
p100
aVbut on a scale and in ways
p101
aVthat have never been possible before.
p102
aVSo what's actually happening
p103
aVis that social networks and real-time technologies
p104
aVare taking us back.
p105
aVWe're bartering, trading,
p106
aVswapping, sharing,
p107
aVbut they're being reinvented
p108
aVinto dynamic and appealing forms.
p109
aVWhat I find fascinating
p110
aVis that we've actually wired our world to share,
p111
aVwhether that's our neighborhood, our school,
p112
aVour office, or our Facebook network,
p113
aVand that's creating an economy
p114
aVof "what's mine is yours."
p115
aVFrom the mighty eBay,
p116
aVthe grandfather of exchange marketplaces,
p117
aVto car-sharing companies such as GoGet,
p118
aVwhere you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,
p119
aVto social lending platforms such as Zopa,
p120
aVthat will take anyone in this audience
p121
aVwith 100 dollars to lend,
p122
aVand match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,
p123
aVwe're sharing and collaborating again
p124
aVin ways that I believe
p125
aVare more hip than hippie.
p126
aVI call this "groundswell collaborative consumption."
p127
aa(lp128
VNow before I dig into the different systems
p129
aVof collaborative consumption,
p130
aVI'd like to try and answer the question
p131
aVthat every author rightfully gets asked,
p132
aVwhich is, where did this idea come from?
p133
aVNow I'd like to say I woke up one morning
p134
aVand said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,"
p135
aVbut actually it was a complicated web
p136
aVof seemingly disconnected ideas.
p137
aVOver the next minute,
p138
aVyou're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display
p139
aVof all the dots that went on in my head.
p140
aVThe first thing I began to notice:
p141
aVhow many big concepts were emerging \u2014
p142
aVfrom the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs \u2014
p143
aVaround how ridiculously easy it is
p144
aVto form groups for a purpose.
p145
aVAnd linked to this crowd mania
p146
aVwere examples all around the world \u2014
p147
aVfrom the election of a president
p148
aVto the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between \u2014
p149
aVon what the power of numbers could achieve.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, you know when you learn a new word,
p152
aVand then you start to see that word everywhere?
p153
aVThat's what happened to me
p154
aVwhen I noticed that we are moving
p155
aVfrom passive consumers
p156
aVto creators,
p157
aVto highly enabled collaborators.
p158
aVWhat's happening
p159
aVis the Internet is removing the middleman,
p160
aVso that anyone from a T-shirt designer
p161
aVto a knitter
p162
aVcan make a living selling peer-to-peer.
p163
aVAnd the ubiquitous force
p164
aVof this peer-to-peer revolution
p165
aVmeans that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.
p166
aVI mean, it's amazing to think
p167
aVthat, in every single minute of this speech,
p168
aV25 hours
p169
aVof YouTube video will be loaded.
p170
aVNow what I find fascinating about these examples
p171
aVis how they're actually tapping into
p172
aVour primate instincts.
p173
aVI mean, we're monkeys,
p174
aVand we're born and bred to share and cooperate.
p175
aVAnd we were doing so for thousands of years,
p176
aVwhether it's when we hunted in packs,
p177
aVor farmed in cooperatives,
p178
aVbefore this big system called hyper-consumption came along
p179
aVand we built these fences
p180
aVand created out own little fiefdoms.
p181
aVBut things are changing,
p182
aVand one of the reasons why
p183
aVis the digital natives, or Gen-Y.
p184
aVThey're growing up sharing \u2014
p185
aVfiles, video games, knowledge.
p186
aVIt's second nature to them.
p187
aVSo we, the millennials \u2014 I am just a millennial \u2014
p188
aVare like foot soldiers,
p189
aVmoving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we."
p190
aa(lp191
VThe reason why it's happening so fast
p192
aVis because of mobile collaboration.
p193
aVWe now live in a connected age
p194
aVwhere we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,
p195
aVfrom a small device in our hands.
p196
aVAll of this was going through my head
p197
aVtowards the end of 2008,
p198
aVwhen, of course, the great financial crash happened.
p199
aVThomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,
p200
aVand he poignantly commented
p201
aVthat 2008 is when we hit a wall,
p202
aVwhen Mother Nature and the market
p203
aVboth said, "No more."
p204
aVNow we rationally know
p205
aVthat an economy built on hyper-consumption
p206
aVis a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.
p207
aVYet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo all of this is a lot of twittering, right?
p210
aVWell it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,
p211
aVuntil actually I realized it was happening
p212
aVbecause of four key drivers.
p213
aVOne, a renewed belief in the importance of community,
p214
aVand a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.
p215
aVA torrent of peer-to-peer social networks
p216
aVand real-time technologies,
p217
aVfundamentally changing the way we behave.
p218
aVThree, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.
p219
aVAnd four, a global recession
p220
aVthat has fundamentally shocked
p221
aVconsumer behaviors.
p222
aVThese four drivers
p223
aVare fusing together
p224
aVand creating the big shift \u2014
p225
aVaway from the 20th century,
p226
aVdefined by hyper-consumption,
p227
aVtowards the 21st century,
p228
aVdefined by collaborative consumption.
p229
aVI generally believe we're at an inflection point
p230
aVwhere the sharing behaviors \u2014
p231
aVthrough sites such as Flickr and Twitter
p232
aVthat are becoming second nature online \u2014
p233
aVare being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.
p234
aVFrom morning commutes to the way fashion is designed
p235
aVto the way we grow food,
p236
aVwe are consuming and collaborating once again.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I
p239
aVhave actually gathered thousands of examples
p240
aVfrom all around the world of collaborative consumption.
p241
aVAnd although they vary enormously
p242
aVin scale, maturity and purpose,
p243
aVwhen we dived into them,
p244
aVwe realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.
p245
aVThe first is redistribution markets.
p246
aVRedistribution markets, just like Swaptree,
p247
aVare when you take a used, or pre-owned, item
p248
aVand move it from where it's not needed
p249
aVto somewhere, or someone, where it is.
p250
aVThey're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' \u2014
p251
aVreduce, reuse, recycle, repair
p252
aVand redistribute \u2014
p253
aVbecause they stretch the life cycle of a product
p254
aVand thereby reduce waste.
p255
aa(lp256
VThe second is collaborative lifestyles.
p257
aVThis is the sharing of resources
p258
aVof things like money, skills and time.
p259
aVI bet, in a couple of years,
p260
aVthat phrases like "coworking"
p261
aVand "couchsurfing" and "time banks"
p262
aVare going to become a part of everyday vernacular.
p263
aVOne of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles
p264
aVis called Landshare.
p265
aVIt's a scheme in the U.K.
p266
aVthat matches Mr. Jones,
p267
aVwith some spare space in his back garden,
p268
aVwith Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.
p269
aVTogether they grow their own food.
p270
aVIt's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,
p271
aVyou wonder why it's never been done before.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow, the third system
p274
aVis product-service systems.
p275
aVThis is where you pay for the benefit of the product \u2014
p276
aVwhat it does for you \u2014
p277
aVwithout needing to own the product outright.
p278
aVThis idea is particularly powerful
p279
aVfor things that have
p280
aVhigh-idling capacity.
p281
aVAnd that can be anything from baby goods
p282
aVto fashions to \u2014
p283
aVhow many of you have a power drill,
p284
aVown a power drill? Right.
p285
aVThat power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes
p286
aVin its entire lifetime.
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVIt's kind of ridiculous, right?
p289
aVBecause what you need is the hole, not the drill.
p290
aV(Laughter)
p291
aV(Applause)
p292
aVSo why don't you rent the drill,
p293
aVor, even better, rent out your own drill to other people
p294
aVand make some money from it?
p295
aVThese three systems are coming together,
p296
aVallowing people to share resources
p297
aVwithout sacrificing their lifestyles,
p298
aVor their cherished personal freedoms.
p299
aVI'm not asking people
p300
aVto share nicely in the sandpit.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo I want to just give you an example
p303
aVof how powerful collaborative consumption can be
p304
aVto change behaviors.
p305
aVThe average car
p306
aVcosts 8,000 dollars a year to run.
p307
aVYet, that car sits idle
p308
aVfor 23 hours a day.
p309
aVSo when you consider these two facts,
p310
aVit starts to make a little less sense
p311
aVthat we have to own one outright.
p312
aVSo this is where car-sharing companies
p313
aVsuch as Zipcar and GoGet come in.
p314
aVIn 2009,
p315
aVZipcar took 250 participants
p316
aVfrom across 13 cities \u2014
p317
aVand they're all self-confessed car addicts
p318
aVand car-sharing rookies \u2014
p319
aVand got them to surrender their keys for a month.
p320
aVInstead, these people had to walk,
p321
aVbike, take the train,
p322
aVor other forms of public transport.
p323
aVThey could only use their Zipcar membership
p324
aVwhen absolutely necessary.
p325
aVThe results of this challenge after just one month
p326
aVwas staggering.
p327
aVIt's amazing that 413 lbs were lost
p328
aVjust from the extra exercise.
p329
aVBut my favorite statistic
p330
aVis that 100
p331
aVout of the 250 participants
p332
aVdid not want their keys back.
p333
aVIn other words, the car addicts
p334
aVhad lost their urge to own.
p335
aa(lp336
VNow products-service systems have been around for years.
p337
aVJust think of libraries and laundrettes.
p338
aVBut I think they're entering a new age,
p339
aVbecause technology makes sharing
p340
aVfrictionless and fun.
p341
aVThere's a great quote that was written in the New York Times
p342
aVthat said, "Sharing is to ownership
p343
aVwhat the iPod is to the 8-track,
p344
aVwhat solar power is to the coal mine."
p345
aVI believe also, our generation,
p346
aVour relationship to satisfying what we want
p347
aVis far less tangible
p348
aVthan any other previous generation.
p349
aVI don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.
p350
aVI don't want a clunky answering machine;
p351
aVI want the message it saves.
p352
aVI don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.
p353
aVIn other words, I don't want stuff;
p354
aVI want the needs or experiences it fulfills.
p355
aVThis is fueling a massive shift
p356
aVfrom where usage trumps possessions \u2014
p357
aVor as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,
p358
aV"where access is better than ownership."
p359
aa(lp360
VNow as our possessions
p361
aVdematerialize into the cloud,
p362
aVa blurry line is appearing
p363
aVbetween what's mine, what's yours,
p364
aVand what's ours.
p365
aVI want to give you one example
p366
aVthat shows how fast this evolution is happening.
p367
aVThis represents an eight-year time span.
p368
aVWe've gone from traditional car-ownership
p369
aVto car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,
p370
aVto ride-sharing platforms that match rides
p371
aVto the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,
p372
aVwhere you can actually make money
p373
aVout of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day
p374
aVto your neighbor.
p375
aVNow all of these systems
p376
aVrequire a degree of trust,
p377
aVand the cornerstone to this working
p378
aVis reputation.
p379
aa(lp380
VNow in the old consumer system,
p381
aVour reputation didn't matter so much,
p382
aVbecause our credit history was far more important
p383
aVthat any kind of peer-to-peer review.
p384
aVBut now with the Web, we leave a trail.
p385
aVWith every spammer we flag,
p386
aVwith every idea we post, comment we share,
p387
aVwe're actually signaling how well we collaborate,
p388
aVand whether we can or can't be trusted.
p389
aVLet's go back to my first example,
p390
aVSwaptree.
p391
aVI can see that Rondoron
p392
aVhas completed 553 trades
p393
aVwith a 100 percent success rate.
p394
aVIn other words, I can trust him or her.
p395
aVNow mark my words,
p396
aVit's only a matter of time
p397
aVbefore we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search
p398
aVand see a cumulative picture
p399
aVof our reputation capital.
p400
aVAnd this reputation capital
p401
aVwill determine our access to collaborative consumption.
p402
aVIt's a new social currency, so to speak,
p403
aVthat could become as powerful as our credit rating.
p404
aa(lp405
VNow as a closing thought,
p406
aVI believe we're actually in a period
p407
aVwhere we're waking up
p408
aVfrom this humongous hangover
p409
aVof emptiness and waste,
p410
aVand we're taking a leap
p411
aVto create a more sustainable system
p412
aVbuilt to serve our innate needs
p413
aVfor community and individual identity.
p414
aVI believe it will be referred to
p415
aVas a revolution, so to speak \u2014
p416
aVwhen society, faced with great challenges,
p417
aVmade a seismic shift
p418
aVfrom individual getting and spending
p419
aVtowards a rediscovery of collective good.
p420
aVI'm on a mission to make sharing cool.
p421
aVI'm on a mission to make sharing hip.
p422
aVBecause I really believe
p423
aVit can disrupt outdated modes of business,
p424
aVhelp us leapfrog
p425
aVover wasteful forms of hyper-consumption
p426
aVand teach us when enough really is enough.
p427
aa(lp428
VThank you very much.

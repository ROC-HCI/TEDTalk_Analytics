VA hundred years ago this month, a 36-year-old Albert Einstein
p5
aVstood up in front of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin
p6
aVto present a radical new theory of space, time and gravity:
p7
aVthe general theory of relativity.
p8
aa(lp9
VGeneral relativity is unquestionably Einstein's masterpiece,
p10
aVa theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales,
p11
aVcapturing in one beautiful line of algebra
p12
aVeverything from why apples fall from trees to the beginning of time and space.
p13
aa(lp14
V1915 must have been an exciting year to be a physicist.
p15
aVTwo new ideas were turning the subject on its head.
p16
aVOne was Einstein's theory of relativity,
p17
aVthe other was arguably even more revolutionary:
p18
aVquantum mechanics,
p19
aVa mind-meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way
p20
aVof understanding the microworld, the world of atoms and particles.
p21
aa(lp22
VOver the last century, these two ideas have utterly transformed
p23
aVour understanding of the universe.
p24
aVIt's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics
p25
aVthat we've learned what the universe is made from,
p26
aVhow it began and how it continues to evolve.
p27
aVA hundred years on, we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics,
p28
aVbut what's at stake now is rather different.
p29
aVThe next few years may tell us whether we'll be able
p30
aVto continue to increase our understanding of nature,
p31
aVor whether maybe for the first time in the history of science,
p32
aVwe could be facing questions that we cannot answer,
p33
aVnot because we don't have the brains or technology,
p34
aVbut because the laws of physics themselves forbid it.
p35
aa(lp36
VThis is the essential problem: the universe is far, far too interesting.
p37
aVRelativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest
p38
aVthat the universe should be a boring place.
p39
aVIt should be dark, lethal and lifeless.
p40
aVBut when we look around us, we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff,
p41
aVfull of stars, planets, trees, squirrels.
p42
aVThe question is, ultimately,
p43
aVwhy does all this interesting stuff exist?
p44
aVWhy is there something rather than nothing?
p45
aVThis contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics,
p46
aVand in the next few years, we may find out whether we'll ever be able to solve it.
p47
aa(lp48
VAt the heart of this problem are two numbers,
p49
aVtwo extremely dangerous numbers.
p50
aVThese are properties of the universe that we can measure,
p51
aVand they're extremely dangerous
p52
aVbecause if they were different, even by a tiny bit,
p53
aVthen the universe as we know it would not exist.
p54
aVThe first of these numbers is associated with the discovery that was made
p55
aVa few kilometers from this hall, at CERN, home of this machine,
p56
aVthe largest scientific device ever built by the human race,
p57
aVthe Large Hadron Collider.
p58
aVThe LHC whizzes subatomic particles around a 27-kilometer ring,
p59
aVgetting them closer and closer to the speed of light
p60
aVbefore smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle detectors.
p61
aVOn July 4, 2012, physicists at CERN announced to the world
p62
aVthat they'd spotted a new fundamental particle
p63
aVbeing created at the violent collisions at the LHC: the Higgs boson.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, if you followed the news at the time,
p66
aVyou'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed,
p67
aVand you'd be forgiven for thinking
p68
aVwe get that way every time we discover a new particle.
p69
aVWell, that is kind of true,
p70
aVbut the Higgs boson is particularly special.
p71
aVWe all got so excited because finding the Higgs
p72
aVproves the existence of a cosmic energy field.
p73
aVNow, you may have trouble imagining an energy field,
p74
aVbut we've all experienced one.
p75
aVIf you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal
p76
aVand felt a force pulling across that gap,
p77
aVthen you've felt the effect of a field.
p78
aVAnd the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field,
p79
aVexcept it has a constant value everywhere.
p80
aVIt's all around us right now.
p81
aVWe can't see it or touch it,
p82
aVbut if it wasn't there,
p83
aVwe would not exist.
p84
aVThe Higgs field gives mass
p85
aVto the fundamental particles that we're made from.
p86
aVIf it wasn't there, those particles would have no mass,
p87
aVand no atoms could form and there would be no us.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut there is something deeply mysterious about the Higgs field.
p90
aVRelativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings,
p91
aVa bit like a light switch.
p92
aVIt should either be off,
p93
aVso that it has a zero value everywhere in space,
p94
aVor it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value.
p95
aVIn both of these scenarios, atoms could not exist,
p96
aVand therefore all the other interesting stuff
p97
aVthat we see around us in the universe would not exist.
p98
aVIn reality, the Higgs field is just slightly on,
p99
aVnot zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value,
p100
aVa bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position.
p101
aVAnd this value is crucial.
p102
aVIf it were a tiny bit different,
p103
aVthen there would be no physical structure in the universe.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo this is the first of our dangerous numbers,
p106
aVthe strength of the Higgs field.
p107
aVTheorists have spent decades trying to understand
p108
aVwhy it has this very peculiarly fine-tuned number,
p109
aVand they've come up with a number of possible explanations.
p110
aVThey have sexy-sounding names like "supersymmetry"
p111
aVor "large extra dimensions."
p112
aVI'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now,
p113
aVbut the key point is this:
p114
aVif any of them explained this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field,
p115
aVthen we should see new particles being created at the LHC
p116
aValong with the Higgs boson.
p117
aVSo far, though, we've not seen any sign of them.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut there's actually an even worse example
p120
aVof this kind of fine-tuning of a dangerous number,
p121
aVand this time it comes from the other end of the scale,
p122
aVfrom studying the universe at vast distances.
p123
aVOne of the most important consequences of Einstein's general theory of relativity
p124
aVwas the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time
p125
aV13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang.
p126
aVNow, according to early versions of the Big Bang theory,
p127
aVthe universe has been expanding ever since
p128
aVwith gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion.
p129
aVBut in 1998, astronomers made the stunning discovery
p130
aVthat the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up.
p131
aVThe universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster
p132
aVdriven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, whenever you hear the word "dark" in physics,
p135
aVyou should get very suspicious
p136
aVbecause it probably means we don't know what we're talking about.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VWe don't know what dark energy is,
p141
aVbut the best idea is that it's the energy of empty space itself,
p142
aVthe energy of the vacuum.
p143
aVNow, if you use good old quantum mechanics to work out
p144
aVhow strong dark energy should be,
p145
aVyou get an absolutely astonishing result.
p146
aVYou find that dark energy
p147
aVshould be 10 to the power of 120 times stronger
p148
aVthan the value we observe from astronomy.
p149
aVThat's one with 120 zeroes after it.
p150
aVThis is a number so mind-bogglingly huge
p151
aVthat it's impossible to get your head around.
p152
aVWe often use the word "astronomical" when we're talking about big numbers.
p153
aVWell, even that one won't do here.
p154
aVThis number is bigger than any number in astronomy.
p155
aVIt's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger
p156
aVthan the number of atoms in the entire universe.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo that's a pretty bad prediction.
p159
aVIn fact, it's been called the worst prediction in physics,
p160
aVand this is more than just a theoretical curiosity.
p161
aVIf dark energy were anywhere near this strong,
p162
aVthen the universe would have been torn apart,
p163
aVstars and galaxies could not form, and we would not be here.
p164
aVSo this is the second of those dangerous numbers,
p165
aVthe strength of dark energy,
p166
aVand explaining it requires an even more fantastic level of fine-tuning
p167
aVthan we saw for the Higgs field.
p168
aVBut unlike the Higgs field, this number has no known explanation.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe hope was that a complete combination
p171
aVof Einstein's general theory of relativity,
p172
aVwhich is the theory of the universe at grand scales,
p173
aVwith quantum mechanics, the theory of the universe at small scales,
p174
aVmight provide a solution.
p175
aVEinstein himself spent most of his later years
p176
aVon a futile search for a unified theory of physics,
p177
aVand physicists have kept at it ever since.
p178
aa(lp179
VOne of the most promising candidates for a unified theory is string theory,
p180
aVand the essential idea is,
p181
aVif you could zoom in on the fundamental particles that make up our world,
p182
aVyou'd see actually that they're not particles at all,
p183
aVbut tiny vibrating strings of energy,
p184
aVwith each frequency of vibration corresponding to a different particle,
p185
aVa bit like musical notes on a guitar string.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo it's a rather elegant, almost poetic way of looking at the world,
p188
aVbut it has one catastrophic problem.
p189
aVIt turns out that string theory isn't one theory at all,
p190
aVbut a whole collection of theories.
p191
aVIt's been estimated, in fact,
p192
aVthat there are 10 to the 500 different versions of string theory.
p193
aVEach one would describe a different universe
p194
aVwith different laws of physics.
p195
aVNow, critics say this makes string theory unscientific.
p196
aVYou can't disprove the theory.
p197
aVBut others actually turned this on its head
p198
aVand said, well, maybe this apparent failure
p199
aVis string theory's greatest triumph.
p200
aVWhat if all of these 10 to the 500 different possible universes
p201
aVactually exist out there somewhere
p202
aVin some grand multiverse?
p203
aVSuddenly we can understand
p204
aVthe weirdly fine-tuned values of these two dangerous numbers.
p205
aVIn most of the multiverse,
p206
aVdark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart,
p207
aVor the Higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form.
p208
aVWe live in one of the places in the multiverse
p209
aVwhere the two numbers are just right.
p210
aVWe live in a Goldilocks universe.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, this idea is extremely controversial, and it's easy to see why.
p213
aVIf we follow this line of thinking,
p214
aVthen we will never be able to answer the question,
p215
aV"Why is there something rather than nothing?"
p216
aVIn most of the multiverse, there is nothing,
p217
aVand we live in one of the few places
p218
aVwhere the laws of physics allow there to be something.
p219
aVEven worse, we can't test the idea of the multiverse.
p220
aVWe can't access these other universes,
p221
aVso there's no way of knowing whether they're there or not.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo we're in an extremely frustrating position.
p224
aVThat doesn't mean the multiverse doesn't exist.
p225
aVThere are other planets, other stars, other galaxies,
p226
aVso why not other universes?
p227
aVThe problem is, it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure.
p228
aVNow, the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while,
p229
aVbut in the last few years, we've started to get the first solid hints
p230
aVthat this line of reasoning may get born out.
p231
aVDespite high hopes for the first run of the LHC,
p232
aVwhat we were looking for there \u2014
p233
aVwe were looking for new theories of physics:
p234
aVsupersymmetry or large extra dimensions
p235
aVthat could explain this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field.
p236
aVBut despite high hopes, the LHC revealed a barren subatomic wilderness
p237
aVpopulated only by a lonely Higgs boson.
p238
aVMy experiment published paper after paper
p239
aVwhere we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics.
p240
aa(lp241
VThe stakes now could not be higher.
p242
aVThis summer, the LHC began its second phase of operation
p243
aVwith an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run.
p244
aVWhat particle physicists are all desperately hoping for
p245
aVare signs of new particles, micro black holes,
p246
aVor maybe something totally unexpected
p247
aVemerging from the violent collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.
p248
aVIf so, then we can continue this long journey
p249
aVthat began 100 years ago with Albert Einstein
p250
aVtowards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature.
p251
aa(lp252
VBut if, in two or three years' time,
p253
aVwhen the LHC switches off again for a second long shutdown,
p254
aVwe've found nothing but the Higgs boson,
p255
aVthen we may be entering a new era in physics:
p256
aVan era where there are weird features of the universe that we cannot explain;
p257
aVan era where we have hints that we live in a multiverse
p258
aVthat lies frustratingly forever beyond our reach;
p259
aVan era where we will never be able to answer the question,
p260
aV"Why is there something rather than nothing?"
p261
aa(lp262
VThank you.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Applause)
p265
aa(lp266
VBruno Giussani: Harry, even if you just said
p267
aVthe science may not have some answers,
p268
aVI would like to ask you a couple of questions, and the first is:
p269
aVbuilding something like the LHC is a generational project.
p270
aVI just mentioned, introducing you, that we live in a short-term world.
p271
aVHow do you think so long term,
p272
aVprojecting yourself out a generation when building something like this?
p273
aa(lp274
VHarry Cliff: I was very lucky
p275
aVthat I joined the experiment I work on at the LHC in 2008,
p276
aVjust as we were switching on,
p277
aVand there are people in my research group who have been working on it
p278
aVfor three decades, their entire careers on one machine.
p279
aVSo I think the first conversations about the LHC were in 1976,
p280
aVand you start planning the machine without the technology
p281
aVthat you know you're going to need to be able to build it.
p282
aVSo the computing power did not exist in the early '90s
p283
aVwhen design work began in earnest.
p284
aVOne of the big detectors which record these collisions,
p285
aVthey didn't think there was technology
p286
aVthat could withstand the radiation that would be created in the LHC,
p287
aVso there was basically a lump of lead in the middle of this object
p288
aVwith some detectors around the outside,
p289
aVbut subsequently we have developed technology.
p290
aVSo you have to rely on people's ingenuity, that they will solve the problems,
p291
aVbut it may be a decade or more down the line.
p292
aa(lp293
VBG: China just announced two or three weeks ago
p294
aVthat they intend to build
p295
aVa supercollider twice the size of the LHC.
p296
aVI was wondering how you and your colleagues welcome the news.
p297
aa(lp298
VHC: Size isn't everything, Bruno. BG: I'm sure. I'm sure.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VIt sounds funny for a particle physicist to say that.
p303
aVBut I mean, seriously, it's great news.
p304
aVSo building a machine like the LHC
p305
aVrequires countries from all over the world to pool their resources.
p306
aVNo one nation can afford to build a machine this large,
p307
aVapart from maybe China,
p308
aVbecause they can mobilize huge amounts of resources,
p309
aVmanpower and money to build machines like this.
p310
aVSo it's only a good thing.
p311
aVWhat they're really planning to do is to build a machine
p312
aVthat will study the Higgs boson in detail and could give us some clues
p313
aVas to whether these new ideas, like supersymmetry, are really out there,
p314
aVso it's great news for physics, I think.
p315
aa(lp316
VBG: Harry, thank you. HC: Thank you very much.
p317
aa(lp318

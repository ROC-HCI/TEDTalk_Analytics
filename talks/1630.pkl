VI've been a journalist now since I was about 17,
p5
aVand it's an interesting industry to be in at the moment,
p6
aVbecause as you all know, there's a huge amount of upheaval
p7
aVgoing on in media, and most of you probably know this
p8
aVfrom the business angle, which is that the business model
p9
aVis pretty screwed, and as my grandfather would say,
p10
aVthe profits have all been gobbled up by Google.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo it's a really interesting time to be a journalist,
p13
aVbut the upheaval that I'm interested in is not on the output side.
p14
aVIt's on the input side. It's concern with
p15
aVhow we get information and how we gather the news.
p16
aVAnd that's changed, because we've had a huge shift
p17
aVin the balance of power from
p18
aVthe news organizations to the audience.
p19
aVAnd the audience for such a long time was in a position
p20
aVwhere they didn't have any way of affecting news
p21
aVor making any change. They couldn't really connect.
p22
aVAnd that's changed irrevocably.
p23
aa(lp24
VMy first connection with the news media was
p25
aVin 1984, the BBC had a one-day strike.
p26
aVI wasn't happy. I was angry. I couldn't see my cartoons.
p27
aVSo I wrote a letter.
p28
aVAnd it's a very effective way of ending your hate mail:
p29
aV"Love Markham, Aged 4." Still works.
p30
aVI'm not sure if I had any impact on the one-day strike,
p31
aVbut what I do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me.
p32
aVAnd that was the round journey. It took that long for anyone
p33
aVto have any impact and get some feedback.
p34
aVAnd that's changed now because, as journalists,
p35
aVwe interact in real time. We're not in a position
p36
aVwhere the audience is reacting to news.
p37
aVWe're reacting to the audience, and we're actually relying on them.
p38
aVThey're helping us find the news. They're helping us
p39
aVfigure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear.
p40
aVSo it's a real-time thing. It's much quicker. It's happening
p41
aVon a constant basis, and the journalist is always playing catch up.
p42
aa(lp43
VTo give an example of how we rely on the audience,
p44
aVon the 5th of September in Costa Rica, an earthquake hit.
p45
aVIt was a 7.6 magnitude. It was fairly big.
p46
aVAnd 60 seconds is the amount of time it took
p47
aVfor it to travel 250 kilometers to Managua.
p48
aVSo the ground shook in Managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter.
p49
aVThirty seconds later, the first message went onto Twitter,
p50
aVand this was someone saying "temblor," which means earthquake.
p51
aVSo 60 seconds was how long it took
p52
aVfor the physical earthquake to travel.
p53
aVThirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled
p54
aVall around the world, instantly. Everyone in the world,
p55
aVhypothetically, had the potential to know that an earthquake
p56
aVwas happening in Managua.
p57
aVAnd that happened because this one person had
p58
aVa documentary instinct, which was to post a status update,
p59
aVwhich is what we all do now, so if something happens,
p60
aVwe put our status update, or we post a photo,
p61
aVwe post a video, and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd what that means is just constant,
p64
aVhuge volumes of data going up.
p65
aVIt's actually staggering. When you look at the numbers,
p66
aVevery minute there are 72 more hours
p67
aVof video on YouTube.
p68
aVSo that's, every second, more than an hour of video gets uploaded.
p69
aVAnd in photos, Instagram, 58 photos are uploaded to Instagram a second.
p70
aVMore than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook.
p71
aVSo by the time I'm finished talking here, there'll be 864
p72
aVmore hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started,
p73
aVand two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo it's an interesting position to be in as a journalist,
p76
aVbecause we should have access to everything.
p77
aVAny event that happens anywhere in the world, I should be able to know about it
p78
aVpretty much instantaneously, as it happens, for free.
p79
aVAnd that goes for every single person in this room.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe only problem is, when you have that much information,
p82
aVyou have to find the good stuff, and that can be
p83
aVincredibly difficult when you're dealing with those volumes.
p84
aVAnd nowhere was this brought home more than during
p85
aVHurricane Sandy. So what you had in Hurricane Sandy was
p86
aVa superstorm, the likes of which we hadn't seen for a long time,
p87
aVhitting the iPhone capital of the universe \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p88
aVand you got volumes of media like we'd never seen before.
p89
aVAnd that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes,
p90
aVso we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted.
p91
aVWe had to deal with composite images
p92
aVthat were merging photos from previous storms.
p93
aVWe had to deal with images from films like "The Day After Tomorrow." (Laughter)
p94
aVAnd we had to deal with images that were so realistic
p95
aVit was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VBut joking aside, there were images like this one from Instagram
p99
aVwhich was subjected to a grilling by journalists.
p100
aVThey weren't really sure. It was filtered in Instagram.
p101
aVThe lighting was questioned. Everything was questioned about it.
p102
aVAnd it turned out to be true. It was from Avenue C
p103
aVin downtown Manhattan, which was flooded.
p104
aVAnd the reason that they could tell that it was real
p105
aVwas because they could get to the source, and in this case,
p106
aVthese guys were New York food bloggers.
p107
aVThey were well respected. They were known.
p108
aVSo this one wasn't a debunk, it was actually something that they could prove.
p109
aVAnd that was the job of the journalist. It was filtering all this stuff.
p110
aVAnd you were, instead of going and finding the information
p111
aVand bringing it back to the reader, you were holding back
p112
aVthe stuff that was potentially damaging.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd finding the source becomes more and more important \u2014
p115
aVfinding the good source \u2014 and Twitter is where most journalists now go.
p116
aVIt's like the de facto real-time newswire,
p117
aVif you know how to use it, because there is so much on Twitter.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd a good example of how useful it can be
p120
aVbut also how difficult was the Egyptian revolution in 2011.
p121
aVAs a non-Arabic speaker, as someone who was looking
p122
aVfrom the outside, from Dublin,
p123
aVTwitter lists, and lists of good sources,
p124
aVpeople we could establish were credible, were really important.
p125
aVAnd how do you build a list like that from scratch?
p126
aVWell, it can be quite difficult, but you have to know what to look for.
p127
aVThis visualization was done by an Italian academic.
p128
aVHe's called André Pannison, and he basically
p129
aVtook the Twitter conversation in Tahrir Square
p130
aVon the day that Hosni Mubarak would eventually resign,
p131
aVand the dots you can see are retweets, so when someone
p132
aVretweets a message, a connection is made between two dots,
p133
aVand the more times that message is retweeted by other people,
p134
aVthe more you get to see these nodes, these connections being made.
p135
aVAnd it's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation,
p136
aVbut what you get is hints at who is more interesting
p137
aVand who is worth investigating.
p138
aVAnd as the conversation grew and grew, it became
p139
aVmore and more lively, and eventually you were left
p140
aVwith this huge, big, rhythmic pointer of this conversation.
p141
aVYou could find the nodes, though, and then you went,
p142
aVand you go, "Right, I've got to investigate these people.
p143
aVThese are the ones that are obviously making sense.
p144
aVLet's see who they are."
p145
aa(lp146
VNow in the deluge of information, this is where
p147
aVthe real-time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself,
p148
aVbecause we have more tools than ever
p149
aVto do that kind of investigation.
p150
aVAnd when you start digging into the sources, you can go
p151
aVfurther and further than you ever could before.
p152
aa(lp153
VSometimes you come across a piece of content that
p154
aVis so compelling, you want to use it, you're dying to use it,
p155
aVbut you're not 100 percent sure if you can because
p156
aVyou don't know if the source is credible.
p157
aVYou don't know if it's a scrape. You don't know if it's a re-upload.
p158
aVAnd you have to do that investigative work.
p159
aVAnd this video, which I'm going to let run through,
p160
aVwas one we discovered a couple of weeks ago.
p161
aa(lp162
VVideo: Getting real windy in just a second.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Rain and wind sounds)
p165
aa(lp166
V(Explosion) Oh, shit!
p167
aa(lp168
VMarkham Nolan: Okay, so now if you're a news producer, this is something
p169
aVyou'd love to run with, because obviously, this is gold.
p170
aVYou know? This is a fantastic reaction from someone,
p171
aVvery genuine video that they've shot in their back garden.
p172
aVBut how do you find if this person, if it's true, if it's faked,
p173
aVor if it's something that's old and that's been reposted?
p174
aa(lp175
VSo we set about going to work on this video, and
p176
aVthe only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account.
p177
aVThere was only one video posted to that account,
p178
aVand the username was Rita Krill.
p179
aVAnd we didn't know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name.
p180
aVBut we started looking, and we used free Internet tools to do so.
p181
aVThe first one was called Spokeo, which allowed us to look for Rita Krills.
p182
aVSo we looked all over the U.S. We found them in New York,
p183
aVwe found them in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Florida.
p184
aVSo we went and we looked for a second free Internet tool
p185
aVcalled Wolfram Alpha, and we checked the weather reports
p186
aVfor the day in which this video had been uploaded,
p187
aVand when we went through all those various cities,
p188
aVwe found that in Florida, there were thunderstorms and rain on the day.
p189
aVSo we went to the white pages, and we found,
p190
aVwe looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook,
p191
aVand we looked through a couple of different addresses,
p192
aVand that took us to Google Maps, where we found a house.
p193
aVAnd we found a house with a swimming pool that looked
p194
aVremarkably like Rita's. So we went back to the video,
p195
aVand we had to look for clues that we could cross-reference.
p196
aVSo if you look in the video, there's the big umbrella,
p197
aVthere's a white lilo in the pool,
p198
aVthere are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool,
p199
aVand there's two trees in the background.
p200
aVAnd we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer,
p201
aVand sure enough, there's the white lilo,
p202
aVthere are the two trees,
p203
aVthere's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo.
p204
aVLittle bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool.
p205
aVSo we were able to call Rita, clear the video,
p206
aVmake sure that it had been shot, and then our clients
p207
aVwere delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.
p208
aa(lp209
VSometimes the search for truth, though,
p210
aVis a little bit less flippant, and it has much greater consequences.
p211
aVSyria has been really interesting for us, because obviously
p212
aVa lot of the time you're trying to debunk stuff that can be
p213
aVpotentially war crime evidence, so this is where YouTube
p214
aVactually becomes the most important repository
p215
aVof information about what's going on in the world.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo this video, I'm not going to show you the whole thing,
p218
aVbecause it's quite gruesome, but you'll hear some of the sounds.
p219
aVThis is from Hama.
p220
aVVideo: (Shouting)
p221
aVAnd what this video shows, when you watch the whole thing through,
p222
aVis bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck
p223
aVand thrown off a bridge.
p224
aVThe allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhood
p225
aVand they were throwing Syrian Army officers' bodies
p226
aVoff the bridge, and they were cursing and using blasphemous language,
p227
aVand there were lots of counterclaims about who they were,
p228
aVand whether or not they were what the video said it was.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo we talked to some sources in Hama who we had been
p231
aVback and forth with on Twitter, and we asked them about this,
p232
aVand the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify.
p233
aVThree different sources said three different things about the bridge.
p234
aVThey said, one, the bridge doesn't exist.
p235
aVAnother one said the bridge does exist, but it's not in Hama. It's somewhere else.
p236
aVAnd the third one said, "I think the bridge does exist,
p237
aVbut the dam upstream of the bridge was closed,
p238
aVso the river should actually have been dry, so this doesn't make sense."
p239
aVSo that was the only one that gave us a clue.
p240
aVWe looked through the video for other clues.
p241
aVWe saw the distinctive railings, which we could use.
p242
aVWe looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south,
p243
aVso we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river.
p244
aVIt had black-and-white curbs.
p245
aVAs we looked at the river itself, you could see there's
p246
aVa concrete stone on the west side. There's a cloud of blood.
p247
aVThat's blood in the river. So the river is flowing
p248
aVsouth to north. That's what that tells me.
p249
aVAnd also, as you look away from the bridge,
p250
aVthere's a divot on the left-hand side of the bank,
p251
aVand the river narrows.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo onto Google Maps we go, and we start
p254
aVlooking through literally every single bridge.
p255
aVWe go to the dam that we talked about, we start just
p256
aVliterally going through every time that road crosses the river,
p257
aVcrossing off the bridges that don't match.
p258
aVWe're looking for one that crosses east-west.
p259
aVAnd we get to Hama. We get all the way from the dam
p260
aVto Hama and there's no bridge.
p261
aVSo we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view,
p262
aVand we find another bridge, and everything starts to line up.
p263
aVThe bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west.
p264
aVSo this could be our bridge. And we zoom right in.
p265
aVWe start to see that it's got a median, so it's a two-lane bridge.
p266
aVAnd it's got the black-and-white curbs that we saw in the video,
p267
aVand as we click through it, you can see someone's
p268
aVuploaded photos to go with the map, which is very handy,
p269
aVso we click into the photos. And the photos start showing us
p270
aVmore detail that we can cross-reference with the video.
p271
aVThe first thing that we see is we see black-and-white curbing,
p272
aVwhich is handy because we've seen that before.
p273
aVWe see the distinctive railing that we saw the guys
p274
aVthrowing the bodies over.
p275
aVAnd we keep going through it until we're certain that this is our bridge.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo what does that tell me? I've got to go back now
p278
aVto my three sources and look at what they told me:
p279
aVthe one who said the bridge didn't exist,
p280
aVthe one who said the bridge wasn't in Hama,
p281
aVand the one guy who said, "Yes, the bridge does exist, but I'm not sure about the water levels."
p282
aVNumber three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden,
p283
aVand we've been able to find that out using some free Internet tools
p284
aVsitting in a cubicle in an office in Dublin
p285
aVin the space of 20 minutes.
p286
aVAnd that's part of the joy of this. Although the web
p287
aVis running like a torrent, there's so much information there
p288
aVthat it's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day,
p289
aVif you use them intelligently, you can find out incredible information.
p290
aVGiven a couple of clues, I could probably find out
p291
aVa lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut what it tells me is that, at a time when
p294
aVthere's more \u2014 there's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been,
p295
aVit's harder to filter, we have greater tools.
p296
aVWe have free Internet tools that allow us,
p297
aVhelp us do this kind of investigation.
p298
aVWe have algorithms that are smarter than ever before,
p299
aVand computers that are quicker than ever before.
p300
aa(lp301
VBut here's the thing. Algorithms are rules. They're binary.
p302
aVThey're yes or no, they're black or white.
p303
aVTruth is never binary. Truth is a value.
p304
aVTruth is emotional, it's fluid, and above all, it's human.
p305
aVNo matter how quick we get with computers, no matter
p306
aVhow much information we have, you'll never be able
p307
aVto remove the human from the truth-seeking exercise,
p308
aVbecause in the end, it is a uniquely human trait.
p309
aVThanks very much. (Applause)

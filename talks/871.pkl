VI want to talk about
p5
aVwhat we learn from conservatives.
p6
aVAnd I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days,
p7
aVso I want to confess to you
p8
aVthat when I was a kid,
p9
aVindeed, I was a conservative.
p10
aVI was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican,
p11
aVa leader in the Teenage Republicans.
p12
aVIndeed, I was the youngest member
p13
aVof any delegation
p14
aVin the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan
p15
aVto be the Republican nominee for president.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, I know what you're thinking.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVYou're thinking, "That's not what the Internets say."
p20
aVYou're thinking, "Wikipedia doesn't say this fact."
p21
aVAnd indeed, this is just one of the examples
p22
aVof the junk that flows across the tubes
p23
aVin these Internets here.
p24
aVWikipedia reports that this guy,
p25
aVthis former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania
p26
aVwas, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people
p27
aVat the Republican National Convention,
p28
aVbut it's just not true.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVIndeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aV(Applause)
p33
aVAll right. Okay, so ... perfect.
p34
aVPerfect.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVOkay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.
p37
aVOkay.
p38
aVFinally, truth will be brought here.
p39
aVOkay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.
p40
aV"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished.
p41
aVThat's it. Please save this.
p42
aVGreat, here we go.
p43
aVAnd ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally.
p44
aVOkay, but no, this is really besides the point.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Applause)
p47
aa(lp48
VBut the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives \u2014
p49
aVnot so much this issue of the 1980 convention \u2014
p50
aVthe thing to think about is this:
p51
aVThey go to church.
p52
aVNow, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church.
p53
aVI'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church.
p54
aVAnd I'm not talking about the God thing.
p55
aVI don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point.
p56
aVThey go to church, by which I mean,
p57
aVthey do lots of things for free for each other.
p58
aVThey hold potluck dinners.
p59
aVIndeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.
p60
aVThey serve food to poor people.
p61
aVThey share, they give,
p62
aVthey give away for free.
p63
aVAnd it's the very same people
p64
aVleading Wall Street firms
p65
aVwho, on Sundays, show up
p66
aVand share.
p67
aVAnd not only food, right.
p68
aa(lp69
VThese very same people
p70
aVare strong believers, in lots of contexts,
p71
aVin the limits on the markets.
p72
aVThey are in many important places
p73
aVagainst markets.
p74
aVIndeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship.
p75
aVBut they're very keen that we don't
p76
aVlet money drop into that relationship,
p77
aVelse it turns into something like this.
p78
aVThey want to regulate us, those conservatives,
p79
aVto stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.
p80
aVBecause they understand:
p81
aVThere are places for the market
p82
aVand places where the market should not exist,
p83
aVwhere we should be free
p84
aVto enjoy the fellowship of others.
p85
aVThey recognize: Both of these things have to live together.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd the second great thing about conservatives:
p88
aVthey get ecology.
p89
aVRight, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century
p90
aVwho taught us about
p91
aVenvironmental thinking \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt.
p92
aVThey first taught us about ecology
p93
aVin the context of natural resources.
p94
aVAnd then they began to teach us in the context of
p95
aVinnovation, economics.
p96
aVThey understand, in that context,
p97
aV"free." They understand "free" is an important
p98
aVessential part of the
p99
aVcultural ecology as well.
p100
aVThat's the thing I want you to think about them.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, I know
p103
aVyou don't believe me, really, here.
p104
aVSo here's exhibit number one.
p105
aVI want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez,
p106
aVa libertarian who works at the, for many people,
p107
aV"evil" Cato Institute.
p108
aVOkay, so Julian made this video.
p109
aVHe's a terrible producer of videos,
p110
aVbut it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.
p111
aVSo here he is beginning.
p112
aa(lp113
VJulian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way
p114
aVremix culture seems to be evolving ...
p115
aa(lp116
VLarry Lessig: So what he does is he begins to tell us
p117
aVabout these three videos.
p118
aVThis is this fantastic Brat Pack remix
p119
aVset to Lisztomania.
p120
aVWhich, of course, spread virally.
p121
aVHugely successful.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Music)
p124
aVAnd then some people from Brooklyn saw it.
p125
aVThey decided they wanted to do the same.
p126
aV(Music)
p127
aVAnd then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it.
p128
aVAnd San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well.
p129
aV(Music)
p130
aVAnd so they're beautiful, but this libertarian
p131
aVhas some important lessons he wants us to learn from this.
p132
aVHere's lesson number one.
p133
aa(lp134
VJS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this.
p135
aVThey are acting in the sense that they're
p136
aVemulating the original mashup.
p137
aVAnd the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye
p138
aVand some experience with video editing.
p139
aVBut this is also basically just a group of friends
p140
aVhaving an authentic social moment
p141
aVand screwing around together.
p142
aVIt should feel familiar and kind of resonate
p143
aVfor anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party
p144
aVwith a group of good friends.
p145
aa(lp146
VLL: Or ...
p147
aa(lp148
VJS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at
p149
aVbecause here, remix isn't just about
p150
aVan individual doing something alone in his basement;
p151
aVit becomes an act of social creativity.
p152
aVAnd it's not just that it yields
p153
aVa different kind of product at the end,
p154
aVit's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other.
p155
aVAll of our normal social interactions
p156
aVbecome a kind of invitation
p157
aVto this sort of collective expression.
p158
aVIt's our real social lives themselves
p159
aVthat are transmuted into art.
p160
aa(lp161
VLL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ...
p162
aa(lp163
VJS: One remix is about
p164
aVindividuals using our shared culture
p165
aVas a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.
p166
aVStage two, social remix,
p167
aVis really about using it to mediate
p168
aVpeople's relationships to each other.
p169
aVFirst, within each video,
p170
aVthe Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template
p171
aVfor performing the social reality of each group.
p172
aVBut there's also a dialogue between the videos,
p173
aVwhere, once the basic structure is established,
p174
aVit becomes a kind of platform
p175
aVfor articulating the similarities and differences
p176
aVbetween the groups' social and physical worlds.
p177
aa(lp178
VLL: And then, here's for me,
p179
aVthe critical key to what
p180
aVJulian has to say ...
p181
aa(lp182
VJS: Copyright policy isn't just about
p183
aVhow to incentivize the production
p184
aVof a certain kind of artistic commodity;
p185
aVit's about what level of control
p186
aVwe're going to permit to be exercised
p187
aVover our social realities \u2014
p188
aVsocial realities that are now inevitably
p189
aVpermeated by pop culture.
p190
aVI think it's important that we
p191
aVkeep these two different kinds of public goods in mind.
p192
aVIf we're only focused on how to maximize
p193
aVthe supply of one,
p194
aVI think we risk suppressing
p195
aVthis different and richer
p196
aVand, in some ways, maybe even more important one.
p197
aa(lp198
VLL: Right. Bingo. Point.
p199
aVFreedom needs this opportunity
p200
aVto both have the commercial success
p201
aVof the great commercial works
p202
aVand the opportunity
p203
aVto build this different kind of culture.
p204
aVAnd for that to happen, you need
p205
aVideas like fair use to be central and protected,
p206
aVto enable this kind of innovation,
p207
aVas this libertarian tells us,
p208
aVbetween these two creative cultures,
p209
aVa commercial and a sharing culture.
p210
aVThe point is they, he, here,
p211
aVgets that culture.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, my concern is, we Dems,
p214
aVtoo often, not so much.
p215
aVAll right, take for example this great company.
p216
aVIn the good old days when this Republican ran that company,
p217
aVtheir greatest work was work that built on the past, right.
p218
aVAll of the great Disney works
p219
aVwere works that took works that
p220
aVwere in the public domain and remixed them,
p221
aVor waited until they entered the public domain to remix them,
p222
aVto celebrate this add-on remix creativity.
p223
aVIndeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course,
p224
aVas "Steamboat Willie,"
p225
aVis a remix of the then, very dominant,
p226
aVvery popular "Steamboat Bill"
p227
aVby Buster Keaton.
p228
aVThis man was a remixer extraordinaire.
p229
aVHe is the celebration and ideal
p230
aVof exactly this kind of creativity.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut then the company passes
p233
aVthrough this dark stage
p234
aVto this Democrat.
p235
aVWildly different.
p236
aVThis is the mastermind behind
p237
aVthe eventual passage of what we call
p238
aVthe Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,
p239
aVextending the term of existing copyrights
p240
aVby 20 years,
p241
aVso that no one could do to Disney
p242
aVwhat Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.
p243
aVNow, when we tried to challenge this,
p244
aVgoing to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there \u2014
p245
aVif we could get them to wake up to this \u2014 to strike it down,
p246
aVwe had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners
p247
aVincluding this right-wing
p248
aVNobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman,
p249
aVwho said he would join our brief
p250
aVonly if the word "no brainer"
p251
aVwas in the brief somewhere.
p252
aV(Laughter)
p253
aVBut apparently, no brains
p254
aVexisted in this place
p255
aVwhen Democrats passed and signed
p256
aVthis bill into law.
p257
aVNow, tiny little quibble of a footnote:
p258
aVSonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican,
p259
aVbut I don't buy it.
p260
aVThis guy is no Republican.
p261
aa(lp262
VOkay, for a second example,
p263
aVthink about this cultural hero,
p264
aVicon on the Left,
p265
aVcreator of this character.
p266
aVLook at the site that he built: "Star Wars" MashUps,
p267
aVinviting people to come and use their creative energy
p268
aVto produce a new generation of attention
p269
aVtowards this extraordinarily important cultural icon.
p270
aVRead the license.
p271
aVThe license for these remixers
p272
aVassigns all of the rights
p273
aVto the remix back to Lucas.
p274
aVThe mashup is owned by Lucas.
p275
aVIndeed, anything you add to the mashup,
p276
aVmusic you might add,
p277
aVLucas has a worldwide perpetual right
p278
aVto exploit that for free.
p279
aVThere is no creator here to be recognized.
p280
aVThe creator doesn't have any rights.
p281
aVThe creator is a sharecropper in this story.
p282
aVAnd we should remember
p283
aVwho employed the sharecroppers:
p284
aVthe Democrats, right?
p285
aa(lp286
VSo the point is the Republicans here
p287
aVrecognize that there's a certain need
p288
aVof ownership,
p289
aVa respect for ownership,
p290
aVthe respect we should give the creator,
p291
aVthe remixer, the owner, the property owner,
p292
aVthe copyright owner
p293
aVof this extraordinarily powerful stuff,
p294
aVand not a generation of sharecroppers.
p295
aVNow, I think there are lessons we should learn here,
p296
aVlessons about openness.
p297
aVOur lives are sharing activities,
p298
aVat least in part.
p299
aVEven for the head of Goldman Sachs,
p300
aVat least in part.
p301
aVAnd for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have
p302
aVwell-protected spaces of fair use.
p303
aa(lp304
VThat's number one. Number two:
p305
aVThis ecology of sharing
p306
aVneeds freedom
p307
aVwithin which to create.
p308
aVFreedom, which means without permission from anyone,
p309
aVthe ability to create.
p310
aVAnd number three: We need to
p311
aVrespect the creator,
p312
aVthe creator of these remixes
p313
aVthrough rights that are
p314
aVdirectly tied to them.
p315
aVNow, this explains the right-wing nonprofit
p316
aVCreative Commons.
p317
aVActually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit,
p318
aVbut of course \u2014 let me just tie it here \u2014
p319
aVthe Creative Commons, which is
p320
aVoffering authors this simple way to mark their content
p321
aVwith the freedoms
p322
aVthey intended to carry.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo that we go from a "all rights reserved" world
p325
aVto a "some rights reserved" world
p326
aVso that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content,
p327
aVbuilding and creating
p328
aVon the basis of this
p329
aVcreative copyrighted work.
p330
aVThese tools that we built
p331
aVenable this sharing in parts
p332
aVthrough licenses that make it clear
p333
aVand a freedom to create
p334
aVwithout requiring permission first
p335
aVbecause the permission has already been granted
p336
aVand a respect for the creator because it builds upon
p337
aVa copyright the creator
p338
aVhas licensed freely.
p339
aVAnd it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy
p340
aVthat's obviously developed around these licenses,
p341
aVas now more than 350 million digital objects
p342
aVare out there, licensed freely
p343
aVin this way.
p344
aa(lp345
VNow that picture of an ecology of creativity,
p346
aVthe picture of an ecology
p347
aVof balanced creativity,
p348
aVis that the ecology of creativity we have right now?
p349
aVWell, as you all know,
p350
aVnot many of us believe we do.
p351
aVI tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity
p352
aVjust last week.
p353
aVI created a video which was based
p354
aVon a Wireside Chat that I'd given,
p355
aVand I uploaded it to YouTube.
p356
aVI then got this email from YouTube
p357
aVweirdly notifying me
p358
aVthat there was content in that
p359
aVowned by the mysterious WMG
p360
aVthat matched their content ID.
p361
aVSo I didn't think much about it.
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd then on Twitter, somebody said to me,
p364
aV"Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose?"
p365
aVimagining that I had this deep conspiracy
p366
aVto reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.
p367
aVI answered, "No." I didn't even think about it.
p368
aVBut then I went to the site
p369
aVand all of the audio in my site had been silenced.
p370
aVMy whole 45-minute video
p371
aVhad been silenced
p372
aVbecause there were snippets in that video,
p373
aVa video about fair use,
p374
aVthat included Warner Music Group music.
p375
aVNow, interestingly,
p376
aVthey still sold ads for that music,
p377
aVif you played the silent video.
p378
aVYou could still buy the music,
p379
aVbut you couldn't hear anything
p380
aVbecause it had been silenced.
p381
aa(lp382
VSo I did what the current regime
p383
aVsays I must do
p384
aVto be free to use
p385
aVYouTube to talk about fair use.
p386
aVI went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.
p387
aVAnd then in an extraordinarily
p388
aVBart Simpson-like, juvenile way
p389
aVyou've actually got to type out these words
p390
aVand get them right
p391
aVto reassert your freedom to speak.
p392
aVAnd I felt like I was in third grade again.
p393
aV"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.
p394
aVI will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."
p395
aVThis is absurd.
p396
aVIt is outrageous.
p397
aVIt is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom
p398
aVwe should be encouraging.
p399
aa(lp400
VAnd the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it?
p401
aVWell, interestingly, in the last presidential election,
p402
aVwho was the number one, active
p403
aVopponent of this system of regulation
p404
aVin online speech?
p405
aVJohn McCain.
p406
aVLetter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal
p407
aVto be more respectful of fair use
p408
aVwith their extraordinary notice and take down system,
p409
aVthat led his campaign so many times
p410
aVto be thrown off the Internet.
p411
aa(lp412
VNow, that was the story of me then,
p413
aVmy good old days of right-wing lunacy.
p414
aVLet me come back to now,
p415
aVnow when I'm a little leftist \u2014
p416
aVI'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty \u2014
p417
aVAnd I wonder, can we on the Left
p418
aVexpect to build this
p419
aVecology of freedom, now,
p420
aVin a world where
p421
aVwe know the extraordinarily powerful
p422
aVinfluences against it,
p423
aVwhere even icons of the Left like this
p424
aVentertain and push bills
p425
aVthat would effectively ban the requirement
p426
aVof open access for government-funded research?
p427
aVThe president, who has supported
p428
aVa process that secretly negotiates agreements,
p429
aVwhich effectively lock us into the insane system
p430
aVof DMCA
p431
aVthat we have adopted
p432
aVand likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out
p433
aVthat, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.
p434
aVNot a single example of reform
p435
aVhas been produced yet.
p436
aVAnd we're not going to see this change
p437
aVin this system
p438
aVanytime soon.
p439
aa(lp440
VSo here's the lessons of openness
p441
aVthat I think we need to learn.
p442
aVOpenness is a commitment
p443
aVto a certain set of values.
p444
aVWe need to speak of those values.
p445
aVThe value of freedom. It's a value of community.
p446
aVIt's a value of the limits in regulation.
p447
aVIt's a value respecting the creator.
p448
aVNow, if we can learn those values
p449
aVfrom at least some influences on the Right,
p450
aVif we can take them and incorporate them,
p451
aVmaybe we could do a little trade.
p452
aVWe learn those values on the Left,
p453
aVand maybe they'll do health care
p454
aVor global warming legislation or something in the Right.
p455
aa(lp456
VAnyway, please join me
p457
aVin teaching these values.
p458
aa(lp459
VThank you very much.

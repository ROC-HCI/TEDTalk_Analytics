VThis is a wheat bread, a whole wheat bread,
p5
aVand it's made with a new technique
p6
aVthat I've been playing around with,
p7
aVand developing and writing about which, for lack of a better name,
p8
aVwe call the epoxy method.
p9
aVAnd I call it an epoxy method because \u2014
p10
aVit's not very appetizing. I understand that \u2014
p11
aVbut \u2014 but
p12
aVif you think about epoxy, what's epoxy?
p13
aVIt's two resins that are, sort of,
p14
aVin and of themselves \u2014 neither of which can make glue,
p15
aVbut when you put the two together,
p16
aVsomething happens. A bond takes place,
p17
aVand you get this very strong, powerful
p18
aVadhesive.
p19
aVWell, in this technique,
p20
aVwhat I've tried to do is kind of
p21
aVgather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world,
p22
aVthe artisan bread-baking community,
p23
aVhas been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so \u2014
p24
aVsince we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America \u2014
p25
aVand put it together to come up with a method
p26
aVthat would help to take whole-grain breads.
p27
aVAnd let's face it, everyone's trying to move towards whole grains.
p28
aVWe finally, after 40 years of knowing
p29
aVthat wholegrain was a healthier option,
p30
aVwe're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over
p31
aVand attempting to actually eat them.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VThe challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is,
p36
aVyou know, how do you make it taste good?
p37
aVBecause whole grain \u2014 it's easy with white flour
p38
aVto make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.
p39
aVIt's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down \u2014
p40
aVwhat is starch? It's \u2014 thank you \u2014 sugar, yes.
p41
aVSo a baker, and a good baker,
p42
aVknows how to pull or draw forth
p43
aVthe inherent sugar trapped in the starch.
p44
aVWith whole grain bread, you have other obstacles.
p45
aVYou've got bran, which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us,
p46
aVor the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber,
p47
aVfor the bran is fiber.
p48
aVIt's got germ. Those are the good things,
p49
aVbut those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat.
p50
aVSo whole grain breads historically
p51
aVhave had sort of this onus of being health food breads,
p52
aVand people don't like to eat,
p53
aVquote, health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily,
p54
aVbut when we think of something as a health food,
p55
aVwe think of it as something we eat out of obligation,
p56
aVnot out of passion and love for the flavor.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd ultimately, the challenge of the baker,
p59
aVthe challenge of every culinary student, of every chef,
p60
aVis to deliver flavor.
p61
aVFlavor is king. Flavor rules.
p62
aVI call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.
p63
aVAnd \u2014 and
p64
aVyou can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once,
p65
aVbut they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?
p66
aVSo, this is the challenge for this bread.
p67
aVWe're going to try this at lunch, and
p68
aVI'll explain a bit more about it,
p69
aVbut it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs \u2014
p70
aVthis attempt, again, at bringing out flavor
p71
aVis to make a piece of dough
p72
aVthe day before that is not leavened.
p73
aVIt's just dough that is wet.
p74
aVIt's hydrated dough we call "the soaker" \u2014
p75
aVthat helps to start enzyme activity.
p76
aVAnd enzymes are the secret, kind of, ingredient in dough
p77
aVthat brings out flavor.
p78
aVIt starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch.
p79
aVThat's what enzymes are doing.
p80
aVAnd so, if we can release some of those,
p81
aVthey become accessible to us in our palate.
p82
aVThey become accessible to the yeast as food.
p83
aVThey become accessible to the oven for caramelization
p84
aVto give us a beautiful crust.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe other pre-dough
p87
aVthat we make is fermented \u2014 our pre-ferment.
p88
aVAnd it's made \u2014 it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga"
p89
aVor any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it,
p90
aVand that starts to develop flavor also.
p91
aVAnd on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy.
p92
aVAnd we're hoping that, sort of, the
p93
aVenzyme piece of dough
p94
aVbecomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough,
p95
aVand when we put them together and add the final ingredients,
p96
aVwe can create a bread that does evoke
p97
aVthe full potential of flavor trapped in the grain.
p98
aVThat's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we \u2014
p99
aVin the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages.
p100
aa(lp101
VI'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them.
p102
aVOkay, we're going to start with the first stage.
p103
aVAnd this is what every student has to begin with.
p104
aVEveryone who works in the culinary world knows that
p105
aVthe first stage of cooking is "mise en place,"
p106
aVwhich is just a French way of saying, "get organized."
p107
aVEverything in its place. First stage.
p108
aVSo in baking we call it scaling \u2014 weighing out the ingredients.
p109
aVStage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them.
p110
aVWe have to develop the gluten.
p111
aVThere's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten.
p112
aVHere's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy
p113
aVbecause we've got glutenin and gliadin,
p114
aVneither of which are strong enough to make a good bread.
p115
aVBut when they get hydrated and they bond to each other,
p116
aVthey create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten.
p117
aVAnd so we, in the mixing process,
p118
aVhave to develop the gluten,
p119
aVwe have to activate the leaven or the yeast,
p120
aVand we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly.
p121
aa(lp122
VThen we get into fermentation, the third stage,
p123
aVwhich is really where the flavor develops.
p124
aVThe yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars,
p125
aVcreating carbon dioxide and alcohol \u2014
p126
aVessentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.
p127
aVIt's yeast burps and sweat.
p128
aVAnd somehow, this is transformed \u2014
p129
aVthe yeast burps and sweats are later transformed \u2014
p130
aVand this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special
p131
aVis that it is a transformational food,
p132
aVand we're going to explore that in a minute.
p133
aVBut then, quickly through the next few stages.
p134
aVWe, after it's fermented and it's developed,
p135
aVstarted to develop flavor and character,
p136
aVwe divide it into smaller units.
p137
aVAnd then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre-shape,
p138
aVusually a round or a little torpedo shape, sometimes.
p139
aVThat's called "rounding."
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd there's a short rest period. It can be for a few seconds.
p142
aVIt can be for 20 or 30 minutes. We call that resting or benching.
p143
aVThen we go into final shaping,
p144
aV"panning" \u2014 which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan.
p145
aVThis takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage.
p146
aVIt can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it.
p147
aVAnd then, stage nine.
p148
aVThe fermentation which started at stage three is continuing
p149
aVthrough all these other stages. Again, developing more flavor.
p150
aVThe final fermentation takes place in stage nine.
p151
aVWe call it "proofing."
p152
aVProofing means to prove that the dough is alive.
p153
aVAnd at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape,
p154
aVand it goes into the oven \u2014 stage 10.
p155
aVThree transformations take place in the oven.
p156
aVThe sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust.
p157
aVThey give us that beautiful brown crust.
p158
aVOnly the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough.
p159
aVInside, the proteins \u2014
p160
aVthis gluten \u2014 coagulates.
p161
aVWhen it gets to about 160 degrees,
p162
aVthe proteins all line up  and they create structure,
p163
aVthe gluten structure \u2014
p164
aVwhat ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread.
p165
aVAnd the starches, when they reach about 180 degrees,
p166
aVgelatinize.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd gelatinization is yet another
p169
aVoven transformation.
p170
aVCoagulation, caramelization and gelatinization \u2014
p171
aVwhen the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them,
p172
aVthey \u2014 they kind of swell, and then they burst.
p173
aVAnd they burst, and they spill their guts into the bread.
p174
aVSo basically now we're eating yeast sweats \u2014
p175
aVsweat, burps and starch guts.
p176
aVAgain, transformed in stage 10 in the oven
p177
aVbecause what went into the oven as dough
p178
aVcomes out in stage 11 as bread.
p179
aVAnd stage 11, we call it cooling \u2014
p180
aVbecause we never really eat the bread right away.
p181
aVThere's a little carry-over baking.
p182
aVThe proteins have to set up, strengthen and firm up.
p183
aVAnd then we have stage 12, which the textbooks call "packaging,"
p184
aVbut my students call "eating."
p185
aVAnd so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat,
p186
aVand in a few minutes we will try this,
p187
aVand see if we have succeeded
p188
aVin fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor.
p189
aa(lp190
VBut I want to go back now and revisit these steps,
p191
aVand talk about it from the standpoint of transformation,
p192
aVbecause I really believe that
p193
aVall things can be understood \u2014
p194
aVand this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients \u2014
p195
aVthat all things can be understood on four levels:
p196
aVthe literal, the metaphoric or poetic level,
p197
aVthe political or ethical level.
p198
aVAnd ultimately, the mystical or sometimes called the "anagogical" level.
p199
aVIt's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal.
p200
aVIn fact, Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels
p201
aVunless you first understand the literal level,
p202
aVso that's why we're talking literally about bread.
p203
aVBut let's kind of look at these stages again
p204
aVfrom the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level \u2014
p205
aVall in my quest for answering the question,
p206
aV"What is it about bread that's so special?"
p207
aVAnd fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor.
p208
aa(lp209
VBecause what happens is,
p210
aVbread begins as wheat or any other grain.
p211
aVBut what's wheat? Wheat is a grass
p212
aVthat grows in the field.
p213
aVAnd, like all grasses, at a certain point it puts out seeds.
p214
aVAnd we harvest those seeds, and those are the wheat kernels.
p215
aVNow, in order to harvest it \u2014 I mean, what's harvesting?
p216
aVIt's just a euphemism for killing, right?
p217
aVI mean, that's what's harvest \u2014 we say we harvest the pig, you know?
p218
aVYes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.
p219
aVWe harvest the wheat,
p220
aVand in harvesting it, we kill it.
p221
aVNow, wheat is alive,
p222
aVand as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.
p223
aVNow, at least with seeds we have the potential for future life.
p224
aVWe can plant those in the ground.
p225
aVAnd we save some of those for the next generation.
p226
aVBut most of those seeds get crushed
p227
aVand turned into flour.
p228
aVAnd at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.
p229
aVIt's not only been killed,
p230
aVbut it's been denied any potential for creating future life.
p231
aVSo we turn it into flour.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo as I said, I think bread is a transformational food.
p234
aVThe first transformation \u2014 and, by the way,
p235
aVthe definition of transformation for me is
p236
aVa radical change from one thing into something else.
p237
aVO.K.? Radical, not subtle.
p238
aVNot like hot water made cold,
p239
aVor cold water turned hot,
p240
aVbut water boiled off and becoming steam.
p241
aVThat's a transformation, two different things.
p242
aVWell, in this case, the first transformation
p243
aVis alive to dead.
p244
aVI'd call that radical.
p245
aVSo, we've got now this flour.
p246
aVAnd what do we do? We add some water.
p247
aVIn stage one, we weigh it.
p248
aVIn stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together,
p249
aVand we create something that we call "clay."
p250
aVIt's like clay.
p251
aVAnd we infuse that clay
p252
aVwith an ingredient that we call "leaven."
p253
aVIn this case, it's yeast, but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean?
p254
aVLeaven comes from the root word that means enliven \u2014
p255
aVto vivify, to bring to life.
p256
aVBy the way, what's the Hebrew word for clay? Adam.
p257
aVYou see, the baker, in this moment,
p258
aVhas become, in a sense,
p259
aVsort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well,
p260
aVwhile it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.
p261
aVAnd we know it's alive because in stage three,
p262
aVit grows. Growth is the proof of life.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd while it's growing, all these
p265
aVliteral transformations are taking place.
p266
aVEnzymes are breaking forth sugars.
p267
aVYeast is eating sugar and
p268
aVturning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.
p269
aVBacteria is in there, eating the same sugars,
p270
aVturning them into acids.
p271
aVIn other words, personality and character's being developed in this dough
p272
aVunder the watchful gaze of the baker.
p273
aVAnd the baker's choices all along the way
p274
aVdetermine the outcome of the product.
p275
aVA subtle change in temperature \u2014 a subtle change in time \u2014
p276
aVit's all about a balancing act between time, temperature
p277
aVand ingredients. That's the art of baking.
p278
aVSo all these things are determined by the baker,
p279
aVand the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.
p280
aVAnd then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough
p281
aVis divided into smaller units, and each of those units
p282
aVare given shape by the baker.
p283
aVAnd as they're shaped, they're raised again,
p284
aVall along proving that they're alive,
p285
aVand developing character.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd at stage 10, we take it to the oven.
p288
aVIt's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough \u2014
p289
aVa few people do, I think, but not too many.
p290
aVI've met some dough eaters, but \u2014
p291
aVit's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life.
p292
aVBut dough is what we're working with,
p293
aVand we take that dough to the oven,
p294
aVand it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough
p295
aVcrosses the threshold of 140 degrees,
p296
aVit passes what we call the "thermal death point."
p297
aVStudents love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game.
p298
aVBut it's the thermal death point \u2014 all life ceases there.
p299
aVThe yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough,
p300
aVto enliven it, to vivify it,
p301
aVin order to complete its mission,
p302
aVwhich is also to turn this dough into bread,
p303
aVhas to give up its life.
p304
aVSo you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.
p305
aVIt's starting to make sense to me \u2014
p306
aVwhat goes in is dough,
p307
aVwhat comes out is bread \u2014
p308
aVor it goes in alive,
p309
aVcomes out dead.
p310
aVThird transformation. First transformation, alive to dead.
p311
aVSecond transformation, dead brought back to life.
p312
aVThird transformation, alive to dead \u2014
p313
aVbut dough to bread.
p314
aa(lp315
VOr another analogy would be,
p316
aVa caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly.
p317
aVAnd it's what comes out of the oven
p318
aVthat is what we call the staff of life.
p319
aVThis is the product
p320
aVthat
p321
aVeveryone in the world eats, that is so difficult to give up.
p322
aVIt's so
p323
aVdeeply embedded in our psyches that
p324
aVbread is used as a symbol for life.
p325
aVIt's used as a symbol for transformation.
p326
aVAnd so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that,
p327
aVagain completing the life cycle,
p328
aVyou know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that \u2014
p329
aVit nurtures us, and we continue to carry on
p330
aVand have opportunities to ponder
p331
aVthings like this.
p332
aVSo this is what I've learned from bread.
p333
aVThis is what bread has taught me in my journey.
p334
aVAnd what we're going to attempt to do
p335
aVwith this bread here, again,
p336
aVis to use, in addition to everything we talked about,
p337
aVthis bread we're going to call "spent grain bread"
p338
aVbecause, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making.
p339
aVBeer is basically liquid bread,
p340
aVor bread is solid beer.
p341
aVAnd \u2014
p342
aV(Laughter)
p343
aVthey \u2014 they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first.
p344
aVAnd the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep
p345
aVin the hot, Egyptian sun, and it turned into bread.
p346
aa(lp347
VBut we've got this bread,
p348
aVand what I did here is to try to, again,
p349
aVevoke even more flavor from this grain,
p350
aVwas we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making.
p351
aVAnd if you make this bread, you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer.
p352
aVI like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain
p353
aVthat's actually from, like, some kind of a lager of some sort \u2014
p354
aVa light lager or an ale \u2014 that is wheat and barley that's been toasted.
p355
aVIn other words, the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains
p356
aVby using sprouting and malting and roasting.
p357
aVWe're going to take some of that, and put it into the bread.
p358
aVSo now we not only have a high-fiber bread,
p359
aVbut now fiber on top of fiber.
p360
aVAnd so this is, again, hopefully
p361
aVnot only a healthy bread,
p362
aVbut a bread that you will enjoy.
p363
aVSo, if I, kind of, break this bread,
p364
aVmaybe we can share this now a little bit here.
p365
aVWe'll start a little piece here,
p366
aVand I'm going to take a little piece here \u2014
p367
aVI think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch.
p368
aVI'll leave you
p369
aVwith what I call the baker's blessing.
p370
aVMay your crust be crisp,
p371
aVand your bread always rise.
p372
aVThank you.

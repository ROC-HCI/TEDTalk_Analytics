VTraditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well.
p5
aVAfter one trillion dollars in African development-related aid
p6
aVin the last 60 years,
p7
aVreal per capita income today is lower than it was in the 1970s.
p8
aVAid is not doing too well.
p9
aa(lp10
VIn response,
p11
aVthe Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 the IMF and the World Bank \u2014
p12
aVpushed for free trade not aid,
p13
aVyet the historical record shows little empirical evidence
p14
aVthat free trade leads to economic growth.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe newly prescribed  silver bullet is microcredit.
p17
aVWe seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea
p18
aVthat every poor peasant in Africa is an entrepreneur.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVYet my work and travel in 40-plus countries across Africa
p21
aVhave taught me that most people want jobs instead.
p22
aa(lp23
VMy solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs.
p24
aVLet's invest in building pan-African titans
p25
aVlike Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.
p26
aVMo took a contrarian bet on Africa when he founded Celtel International in '98
p27
aVand built it into a mobile  cellular provider
p28
aVwith 24 million subscribers across 14 African countries by 2004.
p29
aVThe Mo model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model,
p30
aVwhich prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge-sharing.
p31
aVPerhaps we are not at a stage in Africa
p32
aVwhere many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition.
p33
aa(lp34
VConsider these two alternative scenarios.
p35
aVOne: You loan 200 dollars  to each of 500 banana farmers
p36
aVallowing them to dry  their surplus bananas
p37
aVand fetch 15 percent more revenue at the local market.
p38
aVOr two: You give 100,000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur
p39
aVand help her set up a factory that yields 40 percent additional income
p40
aVto all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs.
p41
aVWe invested in the second scenario,
p42
aVand backed 26-year-old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi
p43
aVto set up an agro-processing factory called Stawi
p44
aVto produce gluten-free banana-based flour and baby food.
p45
aVStawi is leveraging economies of scale
p46
aVand using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners
p47
aVbut its workers, who have an ownership in the business.
p48
aVOur dream is to take an Eric Muthomi and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim,
p49
aVwhich requires skill, financing, local and global partnerships,
p50
aVand extraordinary perseverance.
p51
aa(lp52
VBut why pan-African?
p53
aVThe scramble for Africa during the Berlin Conference of 1884 \u2014
p54
aVwhere, quite frankly, we Africans were not exactly consulted \u2014
p55
aV(Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p56
aVresulted in massive fragmentation
p57
aVand many sovereign states with small populations:
p58
aVLiberia, four million; Cape Verde, 500,000.
p59
aVPan-Africa gives you one billion people,
p60
aVgranted across 55 countries with trade barriers and other impediments,
p61
aVbut our ancestors traded across the continent
p62
aVbefore Europeans drew lines around us.
p63
aVThe pan-African opportunities outweigh the challenges,
p64
aVand that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from just Kenya
p65
aVto Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana, and anywhere else that will buy our food.
p66
aVWe hope to help solve food security, empower farmers, create jobs,
p67
aVdevelop the local economy, and we hope to become rich in the process.
p68
aVWhile it's not the sexiest approach,
p69
aVand maybe it doesn't achieve the same feel-good
p70
aVas giving a woman 100 dollars  to buy a goat on kiva.org,
p71
aVperhaps supporting fewer, higher-impact entrepreneurs
p72
aVto build massive businesses that scale pan-Africa
p73
aVcan help change this.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe political freedom for which our forebearers fought
p76
aVis meaningless without economic freedom.
p77
aVWe hope to aid this fight for economic freedom
p78
aVby building world-class businesses,
p79
aVcreating indigenous wealth,
p80
aVproviding jobs that we so desperately need,
p81
aVand hopefully helping achieve this.
p82
aa(lp83
VAfrica shall rise.
p84
aa(lp85
VThank you.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Applause)
p88
aa(lp89
VTom Rielly: So Sangu, of course, this is strong rhetoric.
p90
aVYou're making 100 percent contrast between microcredit
p91
aVand regular investment and growing regular investment.
p92
aVDo you think there is a role for microcredit at all?
p93
aa(lp94
VSangu Delle: I think there is a role.
p95
aVMicrocredit has been a great, innovative way
p96
aVto expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid.
p97
aVBut for the problems we face in Africa,
p98
aVwhen we are looking at the Marshall Plan
p99
aVto revitalize war-torn Europe,
p100
aVit was not full of donations of sheep.
p101
aVWe need more than just microcredit.
p102
aVWe need more than just give 200 dollars.
p103
aVWe need to build big businesses, and we need jobs.
p104
aa(lp105
VTR: Very good. Thank you so much.

VThere was a time in my life
p5
aVwhen everything seemed perfect.
p6
aVEverywhere I went, I felt at home.
p7
aVEveryone I met,
p8
aVI felt I knew them for as long as I could remember.
p9
aVAnd I want to share with you how I came to that place
p10
aVand what I've learned since I left it.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is where it began.
p13
aVAnd it raises an existential question,
p14
aVwhich is, if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness,
p15
aVwhy am I not visible in the photograph,
p16
aVand where is this time and place?
p17
aVThis is Los Angeles, California, where I live.
p18
aVThis is a police photo. That's actually my car.
p19
aVWe're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles,
p20
aVcalled Cedars-Sinai.
p21
aVAnd the situation is that a car full of paramedics
p22
aVon their way home from the hospital after work
p23
aVhave run across the wreckage,
p24
aVand they've advised the police
p25
aVthat there were no survivors inside the car,
p26
aVthat the driver's dead, that I'm dead.
p27
aVAnd the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive
p28
aVto cut apart the vehicle
p29
aVto extract the body of the driver.
p30
aVAnd when they do, they find that behind the glass,
p31
aVthey find me.
p32
aVAnd my skull's crushed and my collar bone is crushed;
p33
aVall but two of my ribs,
p34
aVmy pelvis and both arms \u2014
p35
aVthey're all crushed, but there is still a pulse.
p36
aVAnd they get me to that nearby hospital,
p37
aVCedars-Sinai,
p38
aVwhere that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding,
p39
aV45 units of blood \u2014
p40
aVwhich means full replacements of all the blood in me \u2014
p41
aVbefore they're able to staunch the flow.
p42
aVI'm put on full life support,
p43
aVand I have a massive stroke,
p44
aVand my brain drops into a coma.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow comas are measured
p47
aVon a scale from 15 down to three.
p48
aVFifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.
p49
aVAnd if you look, you'll see that there's only one way you can score three.
p50
aVIt's essentially there's no sign of life
p51
aVfrom outside at all.
p52
aVI spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three,
p53
aVand it is inside that deepest level of coma,
p54
aVon the rim between my life and my death,
p55
aVthat I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness
p56
aVof inner space.
p57
aa(lp58
VFrom my family looking in from outside,
p59
aVwhat they're trying to figure out
p60
aVis a different kind of existential question,
p61
aVwhich is, how far is it going to be possible to bridge
p62
aVfrom the comatose potential mind that they're looking at
p63
aVto an actual mind,
p64
aVwhich I define simply
p65
aVas the functioning of the brain
p66
aVthat is remaining inside my head.
p67
aVNow to put this into a broader context,
p68
aVI want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien
p69
aVwatching the Earth from outer space,
p70
aVand your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television
p71
aVis the Earth channel,
p72
aVand your favorite show is the Human Show.
p73
aVAnd the reason I think it would be so interesting to you
p74
aVis because consciousness is so interesting.
p75
aVIt's so unpredictable
p76
aVand so fragile.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd this is how we began.
p79
aVWe all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.
p80
aVThe show began with tremendous special effects,
p81
aVbecause there were catastrophic climate shifts \u2014
p82
aVwhich sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.
p83
aVBecause of the Earth tilting on its axis
p84
aVand those catastrophic climate shifts,
p85
aVwe had to figure out how to find better food,
p86
aVand we had to learn \u2014 there's Lucy; that's how we all began \u2014
p87
aVwe had to learn how to crack open animal bones,
p88
aVuse tools to do that, to feed on the marrow,
p89
aVto grow our brains more.
p90
aVSo we actually grew our consciousness
p91
aVin response to this global threat.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow you also continue to watch
p94
aVas consciousness evolved to the point
p95
aVthat here in India, in Madhya Pradesh,
p96
aVthere's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found.
p97
aVIt's a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create,
p98
aVand it's the first known expression of art
p99
aVon the planet.
p100
aVAnd the reason it connects us with consciousness today
p101
aVis that all of us still today,
p102
aVthe very first shape we draw as a child
p103
aVis a circle.
p104
aVAnd then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.
p105
aVWe create an eye \u2014
p106
aVand the eye that evolves through all of our history.
p107
aVThere's the Egyptian god Horus,
p108
aVwhich symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.
p109
aVAnd that comes down right way to the present
p110
aVwith the dollar bill in the United States,
p111
aVwhich has on it an eye of providence.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo watching all of this show from outer space,
p114
aVyou think we get it, we understand
p115
aVthat the most precious resource on the blue planet
p116
aVis our consciousness.
p117
aVBecause it's the first thing we draw;
p118
aVwe surround ourselves with images of it;
p119
aVit's probably the most common image on the planet.
p120
aVBut we don't. We take our consciousness for granted.
p121
aVWhile I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.
p122
aVUntil it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.
p123
aVAnd what I've learned since that event
p124
aVand during my recovery
p125
aVis that consciousness is under threat on this planet
p126
aVin ways it's never been under threat before.
p127
aVThese are just some examples.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd the reason I'm so honored to be here
p130
aVto talk today in India
p131
aVis because India has the sad distinction
p132
aVof being the head injury capital of the world.
p133
aVThat statistic is so sad.
p134
aVThere is no more drastic and sudden gap created
p135
aVbetween potential and actual mind
p136
aVthan a severe head injury.
p137
aVEach one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation,
p138
aVwhich means that India, unless something changes,
p139
aVis accumulating a need
p140
aVfor millennia of rehabilitation.
p141
aVWhat you find in the United States
p142
aVis an injury every 20 seconds \u2014 that's one and a half million every year \u2014
p143
aVstroke every 40 seconds,
p144
aVAlzheimer's disease, every 70 seconds somebody succumbs to that.
p145
aVAll of these represent gaps
p146
aVbetween potential mind and actual mind.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd here are some of the other categories, if you look at the whole planet.
p149
aVThe World Health Organization tells us
p150
aVthat depression is the number one disease on Earth
p151
aVin terms of years lived with disability.
p152
aVWe find that the number two source of disability
p153
aVis depression in the age group
p154
aVof 15 to 44.
p155
aVOur children are becoming depressed
p156
aVat an alarming rate.
p157
aVI discovered during my recovery
p158
aVthe third leading cause of death amongst teenagers
p159
aVis suicide.
p160
aVIf you look at some of these other items \u2014 concussions.
p161
aVHalf of E.R. admissions from adolescents
p162
aVare for concussions.
p163
aVIf I talk about migraine,
p164
aV40 percent of the population
p165
aVsuffer episodic headaches.
p166
aVFifteen percent suffer migraines
p167
aVthat wipe them out for days on end.
p168
aa(lp169
VAll of this is leading \u2014 computer addiction,
p170
aVjust to cover that: the most frequent thing we do
p171
aVis use digital devices.
p172
aVThe average teenager
p173
aVsends 3,300 texts every [month].
p174
aVWe're talking about a society that is retreating
p175
aVinto depression and disassociation
p176
aVwhen we are potentially confronting
p177
aVthe next great catastrophic climate shift.
p178
aVSo what you'd be wondering, watching the Human Show,
p179
aVis are we going to confront and address
p180
aVthe catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way
p181
aVby growing our consciousness,
p182
aVor are we going to continue to retreat?
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd that then might lead you
p185
aVto watch an episode one day
p186
aVof Cedars-Sinai medical center
p187
aVand a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind.
p188
aVThis is a dense array EEG MRI
p189
aVtracking 156 channels of information.
p190
aVIt's not my EEG at Cedars;
p191
aVit's your EEG tonight and last night.
p192
aVIt's the what our minds do every night
p193
aVto digest the day
p194
aVand to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we're asleep
p195
aVto the actual mind when we awaken the following morning.
p196
aVThis is how I was when I returned from the hospital
p197
aVafter nearly four months.
p198
aVThe horseshoe shape you can see on my skull
p199
aVis where they operated and went inside my brain
p200
aVto do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life.
p201
aVBut if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see,
p202
aVI'm looking down,
p203
aVbut let me tell you how I felt at that point.
p204
aVI didn't feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.
p205
aVI felt empty and full, hot and cold,
p206
aVeuphoric and depressed
p207
aVbecause the brain is the world's first
p208
aVfully functional quantum computer;
p209
aVit can occupy multiple states at the same time.
p210
aVAnd with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged,
p211
aVI felt everything simultaneously.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut let's swivel around and look at me frontally.
p214
aVThis is now flash-forward to the point in time
p215
aVwhere I've been discharged by the health system.
p216
aVLook into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes.
p217
aVI'm not able to follow a line of text in a book.
p218
aVBut the system has moved me on
p219
aVbecause, as my family started to discover,
p220
aVthere is no long-term concept
p221
aVin the health care system.
p222
aVNeurological damage, 10 years of rehab,
p223
aVrequires a long-term perspective.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut let's take a look behind my eyes.
p226
aVThis is a gamma radiation spec scan
p227
aVthat uses gamma radiation
p228
aVto map three-dimensional function within the brain.
p229
aVIt requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension,
p230
aVbut in two dimensions I think you can see
p231
aVthe beautiful symmetry and illumination
p232
aVof a normal mind at work.
p233
aVHere's my brain.
p234
aVThat is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain
p235
aVbeing destroyed by the stroke.
p236
aVSo my family, as we moved forward
p237
aVand discovered that the health care system had moved us by,
p238
aVhad to try to find solutions and answers.
p239
aVAnd during that process \u2014 it took many years \u2014
p240
aVone of the doctors said that my recovery, my degree of advance,
p241
aVsince the amount of head injury I'd suffered,
p242
aVwas miraculous.
p243
aVAnd that was when I started to write a book,
p244
aVbecause I didn't think it was miraculous.
p245
aVI thought there were miraculous elements,
p246
aVbut I also didn't think it was right
p247
aVthat one should have to struggle and search for answers
p248
aVwhen this is a pandemic within our society.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo from this experience of my recovery,
p251
aVI want to share four particular aspects \u2014
p252
aVI call them the four C's of consciousness \u2014
p253
aVthat helped me grow my potential mind
p254
aVback towards the actual mind that I work with every day.
p255
aVThe first C is cognitive training.
p256
aVUnlike the smashed glass of my car,
p257
aVplasticity of the brain
p258
aVmeans that there was always a possibility, with treatment,
p259
aVto train the brain
p260
aVso that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness.
p261
aVPlasticity means that there was always
p262
aVhope for our reason \u2014
p263
aVhope for our ability to rebuild that function.
p264
aVIndeed, the mind can redefine itself,
p265
aVand this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva
p266
aVback in the 1970's.
p267
aVThe global perspective
p268
aVis that up to 30 percent of children in school
p269
aVhave learning weaknesses
p270
aVthat are not self-correcting,
p271
aVbut with appropriate treatment,
p272
aVthey can be screened for and detected and corrected
p273
aVand avoid their academic failure.
p274
aVBut what I discovered is it's almost impossible to find anyone
p275
aVwho provides that treatment or care.
p276
aa(lp277
VHere's what my neuropsychologist provided for me
p278
aVwhen I actually found somebody who could apply it.
p279
aVI'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests.
p280
aVLet's just talk about full-scale I.Q.
p281
aVFull-scale I.Q. is the mental processing \u2014
p282
aVhow fast you can acquire information,
p283
aVretain it and retrieve it \u2014
p284
aVthat is essential for success in life today.
p285
aVAnd you can see here there are three columns.
p286
aVUntestable \u2014 that's when I'm in my coma.
p287
aVAnd then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79,
p288
aVwhich is just below average.
p289
aVIn the health care system, if you touch average, you're done.
p290
aVThat's when I was discharged from the system.
p291
aVWhat does average I.Q. really mean?
p292
aVIt meant that when I was given two and a half hours
p293
aVto take a test that anyone here
p294
aVwould take in 50 minutes,
p295
aVI might score an F.
p296
aVThis is a very, very low level
p297
aVin order to be kicked out of the health care system.
p298
aVThen I underwent cognitive training.
p299
aVAnd let me show you what happened to the right-hand column
p300
aVwhen I did my cognitive training over a period of time.
p301
aVThis is not supposed to occur.
p302
aVI.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify
p303
aVat the age of eight.
p304
aa(lp305
VNow the Journal of the National Medical Association
p306
aVgave my memoir a full clinical review,
p307
aVwhich is very unusual.
p308
aVI'm not a doctor. I have no medical background whatsoever.
p309
aVBut they felt the evidences
p310
aVthat there was important, valuable information in the book,
p311
aVand they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it.
p312
aVBut they asked one question. They said, "Is this repeatable?"
p313
aVThat was a fair question
p314
aVbecause my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me.
p315
aa(lp316
VThe answer is yes, and for the first time,
p317
aVit's my pleasure to be able to share two examples.
p318
aVHere's somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive training
p319
aVat ages seven and 11.
p320
aVAnd here's another person in, call it, high school and college.
p321
aVAnd this person is particularly interesting.
p322
aVI won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests,
p323
aVbut they still had a neurologic issue.
p324
aVBut that person could be identified
p325
aVas having a learning disability.
p326
aVAnd with accommodation, they went on to college
p327
aVand had a full life in terms of their opportunities.
p328
aa(lp329
VSecond aspect:
p330
aVI still had crushing migraine headaches.
p331
aVTwo elements that worked for me here
p332
aVare \u2014 the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck pain
p333
aVis through muscular-skeletal imbalance.
p334
aVThe craniomandibular system is critical to that.
p335
aVAnd when I underwent it and found solutions,
p336
aVthis is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth.
p337
aVUp to 30 percent of the population
p338
aVhave a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw
p339
aVthat affects the entire body.
p340
aVI was fortunate to find a dentist
p341
aVwho applied this entire universe
p342
aVof technology you're about to see
p343
aVto establish that if he repositioned my jaw,
p344
aVthe headaches pretty much resolved,
p345
aVbut that then my teeth weren't in the right place.
p346
aVHe then held my jaw in the right position
p347
aVwhile orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.
p348
aVSo my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position.
p349
aVThis affected my entire body.
p350
aa(lp351
VIf that sounds like a very, very strange thing to say
p352
aVand rather a bold statement \u2014
p353
aVHow can the jaw affect the entire body? \u2014
p354
aVlet me simply point out to you,
p355
aVif I ask you tomorrow
p356
aVto put one grain of sand between your teeth
p357
aVand go for a nice long walk,
p358
aVhow far would you last
p359
aVbefore you had to remove that grain of sand?
p360
aVThat tiny misalignment.
p361
aVBear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth.
p362
aVThat's why the same between the before and after that this shows,
p363
aVit's hard to see the difference.
p364
aVNow just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth
p365
aVand see the difference it makes.
p366
aVI still had migraine headaches.
p367
aa(lp368
VThe next issue that resolved
p369
aVwas that, if 90 percent of head and neck pain
p370
aVis caused by imbalance,
p371
aVthe other 10 percent, largely \u2014
p372
aVif you set aside aneurysms, brain cancer
p373
aVand hormonal issues \u2014
p374
aVis the circulation.
p375
aVImagine the blood flowing through your body \u2014
p376
aVI was told at UCLA Medical Center \u2014
p377
aVas one sealed system.
p378
aVThere's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it,
p379
aVand around that pipe are the nerves
p380
aVdrawing their nutrient supply from the blood.
p381
aVThat's basically it.
p382
aVIf you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system,
p383
aVit bulges someplace else.
p384
aVIf that some place else where it bulges
p385
aVis inside the biggest nerve in your body, your brain,
p386
aVyou get a vascular migraine.
p387
aVThis is a level of pain that's only known
p388
aVto other people who suffer vascular migraines.
p389
aVUsing this technology,
p390
aVthis is mapping in three dimensions.
p391
aVThis is an MRI MRA MRV,
p392
aVa volumetric MRI.
p393
aVUsing this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Center
p394
aVwere able to identify
p395
aVwhere that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.
p396
aVA vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body.
p397
aVAnd in the following months and years,
p398
aVI felt the neurological flow of life itself returning.
p399
aa(lp400
VCommunication, the next C. This is critical.
p401
aVAll consciousness is about communication.
p402
aVAnd here, by great fortune,
p403
aVone of my father's clients
p404
aVhad a husband who worked
p405
aVat the Alfred Mann Foundation for Scientific Research.
p406
aVAlfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator
p407
aVwho's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness,
p408
aVwhether to restore hearing to the deaf, vision to the blind
p409
aVor movement to the paralyzed.
p410
aVAnd I'm just going to give you an example today
p411
aVof movement to the paralyzed.
p412
aVI've brought with me, from Southern California,
p413
aVthe FM device.
p414
aVThis is it being held in the hand.
p415
aVIt weighs less than a gram.
p416
aVSo two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime.
p417
aVFive of them would still weigh less
p418
aVthan a rupee coin.
p419
aa(lp420
VWhere does it go inside the body?
p421
aVIt has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free
p422
aVfor over 80 years.
p423
aVSo it goes in and it stays there.
p424
aVHere are the implantation sites.
p425
aVThe concept that they're working towards \u2014 and they have working prototypes \u2014
p426
aVis that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body
p427
aVwhere they're needed.
p428
aVThe main unit will then go inside the brain.
p429
aVAn FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex,
p430
aVwill send signals in real time
p431
aVto the motor points in the relevant muscles
p432
aVso that the person will be able to move their arm, let's say, in real time,
p433
aVif they've lost control of their arm.
p434
aVAnd other FM devices implanted in fingertips,
p435
aVon contacting a surface,
p436
aVwill send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain,
p437
aVso that the person feels a sense of touch.
p438
aVIs this science fiction? No,
p439
aVbecause I'm wearing the first application of this technology.
p440
aVI don't have the ability to control my left foot.
p441
aVA radio device is controlling every step I take,
p442
aVand a sensor picks up my foot for me
p443
aVevery time I walk.
p444
aa(lp445
VAnd in closing, I want to share
p446
aVthe personal reason why this meant so much to me
p447
aVand changed the direction of my life.
p448
aVIn my coma, one of the presences I sensed
p449
aVwas someone I felt was a protector.
p450
aVAnd when I came out of my coma, I recognized my family,
p451
aVbut I didn't remember my own past.
p452
aVGradually, I remembered the protector was my wife.
p453
aVAnd I whispered the good news
p454
aVthrough my broken jaw, which was wired shut,
p455
aVto my night nurse.
p456
aVAnd the following morning, my mother came to explain
p457
aVthat I'd not always been in this bed, in this room,
p458
aVthat I'd been working in film and television
p459
aVand that I had been in a crash
p460
aVand that, yes, I was married,
p461
aVbut Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash.
p462
aVAnd during my time in coma,
p463
aVshe had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix.
p464
aVNow in the dark years that followed, I had to work out what remained for me
p465
aVif everything that made today special was gone.
p466
aVAnd as I discovered these threats to consciousness
p467
aVand how they are surrounding the world
p468
aVand enveloping the lives of more and more people every day,
p469
aVI discovered what truly remained.
p470
aVI believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness,
p471
aVthat the Human Show can stay on the air
p472
aVfor millennia to come.
p473
aVI believe that we can all rise and shine.
p474
aa(lp475

VLakshmi Pratury: Just stay for a second. Just stay here for a second.

aa(lp483
VYou know,
p484
aVwhen I heard Simon's \u2014
p485
aVplease sit down; I just want to talk to him for a second \u2014
p486
aVwhen I read his book, I went to LA to meet him.
p487
aVAnd so I was sitting in this restaurant,
p488
aVwaiting for a man to come by
p489
aVwho obviously would have some difficulty ...
p490
aVI don't know what I had in my mind.
p491
aVAnd he was walking around.
p492
aVI didn't expect that person that I was going to meet
p493
aVto be him.
p494
aVAnd then we met and we talked,
p495
aVand I'm like, he doesn't look
p496
aVlike somebody who was built out of nothing.
p497
aVAnd then I was amazed
p498
aVat what role technology played
p499
aVin your recovery.
p500
aVAnd we have his book outside
p501
aVin the bookshop.
p502
aVThe thing that amazed me
p503
aVis the painstaking detail
p504
aVwith which he has written
p505
aVevery hospital he has been to,
p506
aVevery treatment he got,
p507
aVevery near-miss he had,
p508
aVand how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations.
p509
aVSo I think this one detail
p510
aVwent past people really quick.
p511
aVTell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg.
p512
aa(lp513
VSimon Lewis: I knew when I was timing this
p514
aVthat there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about \u2014
p515
aVWell this is it. This is the control unit.
p516
aVAnd this records every single step I've taken
p517
aVfor, ooh, five or six years now.
p518
aVAnd if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it.
p519
aVThat little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on.
p520
aVWhen I press it again, it'll chirp three times,
p521
aVand that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go.
p522
aVAnd that's my friend. I mean, I charge it every night.
p523
aVAnd it works. It works.
p524
aVAnd what I would love to add because I didn't have time ...
p525
aa(lp526
VWhat does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here.
p527
aVThis down here, if the camera can see that,
p528
aVthat is a small antenna.
p529
aVUnderneath my heel, there is a sensor
p530
aVthat detects when my foot leaves the ground \u2014
p531
aVwhat's called the heel lift.
p532
aVThis thing blinks all the time; I'll leave it out, so you might be able to see it.
p533
aVBut this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.
p534
aVAnd if you walk faster, if I walk faster,
p535
aVit detects what's called the time interval,
p536
aVwhich is the interval between each heel lift.
p537
aVAnd it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation.
p538
aVThe other things they've worked on \u2014 I didn't have time to say this in my talk \u2014
p539
aVis they've restored functional hearing
p540
aVto thousands of deaf people.
p541
aa(lp542
VI could tell you the story: this was going to be an abandoned technology,
p543
aVbut Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire,
p544
aV[Dr. Schindler.]
p545
aVAnd he was going to retire \u2014 all the technology was going to be lost,
p546
aVbecause not a single medical manufacturer would take it on
p547
aVbecause it was a small issue.
p548
aVBut there's millions of deaf people in the world,
p549
aVand the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.
p550
aVIt works.
p551
aVAnd the other thing is they're working on artificial retinas for the blind.
p552
aVAnd this, this is the implantable generation.
p553
aVBecause what I didn't say in my talk
p554
aVis this is actually exoskeletal.
p555
aVI should clarify that.
p556
aVBecause the first generation is exoskeletal,
p557
aVit's wrapped around the leg,
p558
aVaround the affected limb.
p559
aVI must tell you, they're an amazing \u2014
p560
aVthere's a hundred people who work in that building \u2014
p561
aVengineers, scientists,
p562
aVand other team members \u2014 all the time.
p563
aa(lp564
VAlfred Mann has set up this foundation
p565
aVto advance this research
p566
aVbecause he saw
p567
aVthere's no way venture capital would come in for something like this.
p568
aVThe audience is too small.
p569
aVYou'd think, there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world,
p570
aVbut the audience is too small,
p571
aVand the amount of research, the time it takes,
p572
aVthe FDA clearances,
p573
aVthe payback time is too long
p574
aVfor V.C. to be interested.
p575
aVSo he saw a need and he stepped in.
p576
aVHe's a very, very remarkable man.
p577
aVHe's done a lot of very cutting-edge science.
p578
aa(lp579
VLP: So when you get a chance, spend some time with Simon.
p580
aVThank you. Thank you.

An acclaimed author, speaker and commentator, Lewis uses creative visualizations that fuse cutting-edge medicine, scientific research and digital art to illustrate solutions to society&rsquo;s most pressing problem: the erosion of consciousness and need for solutions to nurture and grow our minds through cognitive and other therapies.</p><p>An advocate for change in how we educate our children and ourselves, he says that we must not take our consciousness for granted, but use specific tools to screen and detect learning weaknesses and prevent academic failure.

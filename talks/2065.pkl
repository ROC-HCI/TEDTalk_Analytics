VIn Kenya, 1984 is known
p5
aVas the year of the cup,
p6
aVor the goro goro.
p7
aVThe goro goro is a cup used to measure
p8
aVtwo kilograms of maize flower on the market,
p9
aVand the maize flower is used to make ugali,
p10
aVa polenta-like cake that is eaten together with vegetables.
p11
aVBoth the maize and the vegetables are grown
p12
aVon most Kenyan farms,
p13
aVwhich means that most families can feed themselves
p14
aVfrom their own farm.
p15
aVOne goro goro can feed three meals
p16
aVfor an average family,
p17
aVand in 1984, the whole harvest
p18
aVcould fit in one goro goro.
p19
aVIt was and still is one of the worst droughts
p20
aVin living memory.
p21
aVNow today, I insure farmers against droughts
p22
aVlike those in the year of the cup,
p23
aVor to be more specific, I insure the rains.
p24
aa(lp25
VI come from a family of missionaries
p26
aVwho built hospitals in Indonesia,
p27
aVand my father built a psychiatric hospital
p28
aVin Tanzania.
p29
aVThis is me, age five, in front of that hospital.
p30
aVI don't think they thought I'd grow up
p31
aVto sell insurance. (Laughter)
p32
aVSo let me tell you how that happened.
p33
aa(lp34
VIn 2008, I was working
p35
aVfor the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda,
p36
aVand my boss had just been promoted
p37
aVto become the minister.
p38
aVShe launched an ambitious plan
p39
aVto start a green revolution in her country,
p40
aVand before we knew it, we were importing
p41
aVtons of fertilizer and seed
p42
aVand telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer
p43
aVand plant.
p44
aVA couple of weeks later,
p45
aVthe International Monetary Fund visited us,
p46
aVand asked my minister,
p47
aV"Minister, it's great that you want to help farmers
p48
aVreach food security, but what if it doesn't rain?"
p49
aVMy minister answered proudly
p50
aVand somewhat defiantly,
p51
aV"I am going to pray for rain."
p52
aVThat ended the discussion.
p53
aVOn the way back to the ministry in the car,
p54
aVshe turned around to me and said,
p55
aV"Rose, you've always been interested in finance.
p56
aVGo find us some insurance."
p57
aa(lp58
VIt's been six years since,
p59
aVand last year I was fortunate enough
p60
aVto be part of a team that insured
p61
aVover 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda
p62
aVagainst drought.
p63
aVThey owned an average of half an acre
p64
aVand paid on average two Euros in premium.
p65
aVIt's microinsurance.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, traditional insurance doesn't work
p68
aVwith two to three Euros of premium,
p69
aVbecause traditional insurance relies on farm visits.
p70
aVA farmer here in Germany would be visited
p71
aVfor the start of the season, halfway through,
p72
aVand at the end, and again if there was a loss,
p73
aVto estimate the damages.
p74
aVFor a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa,
p75
aVthe maths of doing those visits
p76
aVsimply don't add up.
p77
aVSo instead, we rely on technology and data.
p78
aVThis satellite measures
p79
aVwhether there were clouds or not,
p80
aVbecause think about it:
p81
aVIf there are clouds, then you might have some rain,
p82
aVbut if there are no clouds,
p83
aVthen it's actually impossible for it to rain.
p84
aVThese images show the onset of the rains
p85
aVthis season in Kenya.
p86
aVYou see that around March 6,
p87
aVthe clouds move in and then disappear,
p88
aVand then around the March 11,
p89
aVthe clouds really move in.
p90
aVThat, and those clouds,
p91
aVwere the onset of the rains this year.
p92
aVThis satellite covers the whole of Africa
p93
aVand goes back as far as 1984,
p94
aVand that's important, because if you know
p95
aVhow many times a place has had a drought
p96
aVin the last 30 years,
p97
aVyou can make a pretty good estimate
p98
aVwhat the chances are of drought in the future,
p99
aVand that means that you can put a price tag
p100
aVon the risk of drought.
p101
aa(lp102
VThe data alone isn't enough.
p103
aVWe devise agronomic algorithms
p104
aVwhich tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when.
p105
aVFor example, for maize at planting,
p106
aVyou need to have two days of rain
p107
aVfor farmers to plant,
p108
aVand then it needs to rain once every two weeks
p109
aVfor the crop to properly germinate.
p110
aVAfter that, you need rain every three weeks
p111
aVfor the crop to form its leaves,
p112
aVwhereas at flowering, you need it to rain more frequently,
p113
aVabout once every 10 days for the crop to form its cob.
p114
aVAt the end of the season,
p115
aVyou actually don't want it to rain,
p116
aVbecause rains then can damage the crop.
p117
aa(lp118
VDevising such a cover is difficult,
p119
aVbut it turned out the real challenge
p120
aVwas selling insurance.
p121
aVWe set ourselves a modest target
p122
aVof 500 farmers insured after our first season.
p123
aVAfter a couple of months' intense marketing,
p124
aVwe had signed up the grand total
p125
aVof 185 farmers.
p126
aVI was disappointed and confounded.
p127
aVEverybody kept telling me that farmers
p128
aVwanted insurance,
p129
aVbut our prime customers simply weren't buying.
p130
aVThey were waiting to see what would happen,
p131
aVdidn't trust insurance companies,
p132
aVor thought, "I've managed for so many years.
p133
aVWhy would I buy insurance now?"
p134
aa(lp135
VNow many of you know microcredit,
p136
aVthe method of providing small loans to poor people
p137
aVpioneered by Muhammad Yunus,
p138
aVwho won the Nobel Peace Prize
p139
aVfor his work with the Grameen Bank.
p140
aVTurns out, selling microcredit
p141
aVisn't the same as selling insurance.
p142
aVFor credit, a farmer needs to earn the trust of a bank,
p143
aVand if it succeeds, the bank will advance him money.
p144
aVThat's an attractive proposition.
p145
aVFor insurance, the farmer needs to trust
p146
aVthe insurance company, and needs
p147
aVto advance the insurance company money.
p148
aVIt's a very different value proposition.
p149
aVAnd so the uptick of insurance has been slow,
p150
aVwith so far only 4.4 percent of Africans
p151
aVtaking up insurance in 2012,
p152
aVand half of that number is in one country,
p153
aVSouth Africa.
p154
aa(lp155
VWe tried for some years
p156
aVselling insurance directly to farmers,
p157
aVwith very high marketing cost
p158
aVand very limited success.
p159
aVThen we realized that there were many organizations
p160
aVworking with farmers:
p161
aVseed companies, microfinance institutions,
p162
aVmobile phone companies,
p163
aVgovernment agencies.
p164
aVThey were all providing loans to farmers,
p165
aVand often, just before they'd finalize the loan,
p166
aVthe farmer would say,
p167
aV"But what if it doesn't rain?
p168
aVHow do you expect me to repay my loan?"
p169
aVMany of these organizations
p170
aVwere taking on the risk themselves,
p171
aVsimply hoping that that year,
p172
aVthe worst wouldn't happen.
p173
aVMost of the organizations, however,
p174
aVwere limiting their growth in agriculture.
p175
aVThey couldn't take on this kind of risk.
p176
aVThese organizations became our customers,
p177
aVand when combining credit and insurance,
p178
aVinteresting things can happen.
p179
aVLet me tell you one more story.
p180
aa(lp181
VAt the start of February 2012 in western Kenya,
p182
aVthe rains started, and they started early,
p183
aVand when rains start early, farmers are encouraged,
p184
aVbecause it usually means that the season is going to be good.
p185
aVSo they took out loans and planted.
p186
aVFor the next three weeks,
p187
aVthere wasn't a single drop of rain,
p188
aVand the crops that had germinated so well
p189
aVshriveled and died.
p190
aVWe'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution
p191
aVthat had provided those loans
p192
aVto about 6,000 farmers in that area,
p193
aVand we called them up and said,
p194
aV"Look, we know about the drought.
p195
aVWe've got you.
p196
aVWe'll give you 200,000 Euros at the end of the season."
p197
aVThey said, "Wow, that's great,
p198
aVbut that'll be late.
p199
aVCould you give us the money now?
p200
aVThen these farmers can still replant
p201
aVand can get a harvest this season."
p202
aVSo we convinced our insurance partners,
p203
aVand later that April, these farmers replanted.
p204
aVWe took the idea of replanting to a seed company
p205
aVand convinced them to price the cost of insurance
p206
aVinto every bag of seed,
p207
aVand in every bag, we packed a card
p208
aVthat had a number on it,
p209
aVand when the farmers would open the card,
p210
aVthey'd text in that number,
p211
aVand that number would actually help us
p212
aVto locate the farmer
p213
aVand allocate them to a satellite pixel.
p214
aVA satellite would then measure the rainfall
p215
aVfor the next three weeks,
p216
aVand if it didn't rain,
p217
aVwe'd replace their seed.
p218
aa(lp219
VOne of the first \u2014
p220
aV(Applause) \u2014 Hold on, I'm not there!
p221
aa(lp222
VOne of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee
p223
aVwas Bosco Mwinyi.
p224
aVWe visited his farm later that August,
p225
aVand I wish I could show you the smile on his face
p226
aVwhen he showed us his harvest,
p227
aVbecause it warmed my heart
p228
aVand it made me realize why selling insurance
p229
aVcan be a good thing.
p230
aVBut you know, he insisted
p231
aVthat we get his whole harvest in the picture,
p232
aVso we had to zoom out a lot.
p233
aVInsurance secured his harvest that season,
p234
aVand I believe that today,
p235
aVwe have all the tools to enable African farmers
p236
aVto take control of their own destiny.
p237
aVNo more years of the cup.
p238
aVInstead, I am looking forward to, at least somehow,
p239
aVthe year of the insurance,
p240
aVor the year of the great harvest.
p241
aa(lp242
VThank you.

&ldquo;insuring the rain.&rdquo; Raised in Tanzania, Goslinga was working for the Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture in 2008 when the minister had a bold idea: could they offer insurance to small farmers to protect them in case rain didn&rsquo;t come when needed? Goslinga ran with the idea. Under the Syngenta Foundation&rsquo;s Kilimo Salama program, which is Swahili for &ldquo;safe farming,&rdquo; the thought became a reality. Last year, through its local insurance partners, it insured 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda against drought, and was recently spun into a company called ACRE.</p>  <p>Think of microinsurance the way you think of microloans. The average farmer insured in this way has a half-acre farm and pays just two Euros as an annual premium. Rather than using farm visits to determine damages, cloud data determines when payouts are due to farmers. Building this program has taken the Syngenta Foundation six years and has greatly tested their aptitude for creative problem-solving, from figuring out how to get farmers to trust insurance companies to creating technological solutions to help map which farmers are using the product.</p>", "slug": "rose_goslinga", "whotheyare": "Rose Goslinga isn\\u2019t your typical insurance salesperson.

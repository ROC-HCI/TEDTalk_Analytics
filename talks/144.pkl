VSo I really consider myself a storyteller.
p5
aVBut I don't really tell stories in the usual way,
p6
aVin the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.
p7
aVInstead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow
p8
aVlarge numbers of other people to tell their stories,
p9
aVpeople all around the world.
p10
aVI do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.
p11
aVI think people are very similar,
p12
aVbut I also think that we have trouble seeing that.
p13
aa(lp14
VYou know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps,
p15
aVand I think we all see a lot of gaps.
p16
aVAnd we define ourselves by our gaps.
p17
aVThere's language gaps,
p18
aVthere's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps,
p19
aVthere's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps,
p20
aVthere's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps,
p21
aVthere's also religious gaps.
p22
aVYou know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps
p23
aVbecause they make us feel like we identify with something,
p24
aVsome smaller community.
p25
aVBut I think that actually, despite our gaps,
p26
aVwe really have a lot in common.
p27
aVAnd I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need
p28
aVto express ourselves.
p29
aVI think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut the thing about self-expression
p32
aVis that there's traditionally been this imbalance
p33
aVbetween the desire that we have to express ourselves
p34
aVand the number of sympathetic friends
p35
aVwho are willing to stand around and listen.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VThis, also, is nothing new.
p40
aVSince the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance
p41
aVby making art, writing poems, singing songs,
p42
aVscripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper,
p43
aVgossiping with friends. This is nothing new.
p44
aa(lp45
VWhat's new is that in the last several years
p46
aVa lot of these very traditional physical human activities,
p47
aVthese acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.
p48
aVAnd as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints,
p49
aVfootprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.
p50
aVAnd so what I do is, I write computer programs
p51
aVthat study very large sets of these footprints,
p52
aVand then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them \u2014
p53
aVwhat they feel, what they think,
p54
aVwhat's different in the world today than usual,
p55
aVthese sorts of questions.
p56
aa(lp57
VOne project that explores these ideas,
p58
aVwhich was made about a year ago,
p59
aVis a piece called We Feel Fine.
p60
aVThis is a piece that every two or three minutes
p61
aVscans the world's newly-posted blog entries
p62
aVfor occurrences of the phrases "I feel" or "I am feeling."
p63
aVAnd when it finds one of those phrases,
p64
aVit grabs the sentence up to the period,
p65
aVand then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender
p66
aVand geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.
p67
aVThen, knowing the geographical location and the time,
p68
aVwe can also then figure out the weather
p69
aVwhen that person wrote the sentence.
p70
aVAll of this information is saved in a database
p71
aVthat collects about 20,000 feelings a day.
p72
aVIt's been running for about a year and a half.
p73
aVIt's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.
p74
aVAnd I'll show you a glimpse
p75
aVof how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.
p76
aa(lp77
VWhat you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles,
p78
aVeach of which represents a single human feeling
p79
aVthat was stated in the last few hours.
p80
aVThe color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside \u2014
p81
aVso that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.
p82
aVAnd sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.
p83
aVThe diameter of each dot
p84
aVrepresents the length of the sentence inside,
p85
aVso that the large dots contain large sentences,
p86
aVand the small dots contain small sentences.
p87
aVAny dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here,
p88
aV"I would just feel so much better
p89
aVif I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me
p90
aVin the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips."
p91
aVSo it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes
p92
aVin the world of human emotions.
p93
aVAnd all of these are stated by people:
p94
aV"I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much,
p95
aVbut after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond,
p96
aVit's nice to feel bigger again."
p97
aa(lp98
VThe dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics,
p99
aVand they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.
p100
aVAnd then they also exhibit curiosity.
p101
aVYou can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.
p102
aVYou can see some other ones
p103
aVare swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen
p104
aVaround six words. Those six words represent the six movements
p105
aVof We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness.
p106
aVThere's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.
p107
aVAnd I'll walk you through a few of those now.
p108
aVMurmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.
p109
aVAnd then, one by one, in reverse chronological order,
p110
aVthey excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.
p111
aV"I feel a bit better now."
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
V"I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do."
p116
aV"I feel gypped out of something awesome here."
p117
aV"I feel so free; I feel so good."
p118
aV"I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of."
p119
aVAnd you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog
p120
aVfrom which it was collected. And in that way,
p121
aVyou can connect with the authors of these statements
p122
aVif you feel some degree of empathy.
p123
aa(lp124
VThe next movement is called Montage.
p125
aVMontage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs
p126
aVto become extracted and display themselves in a grid.
p127
aVThis grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings
p128
aVin the last few hours, if you will.
p129
aVEach of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.
p130
aVWe see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have fun
p131
aVif it's not the both of us." That was from someone in Michigan.
p132
aVWe see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day."
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VThese are automatically constructed using the found objects:
p137
aV"I think I feel a little full."
p138
aa(lp139
VThe next movement is called mobs.
p140
aVMobs provides different statistical breakdowns
p141
aVof the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.
p142
aVWe see that "better" is the most frequent feeling right now,
p143
aVfollowed by "good," "bad," "guilty," "right," "down," "sick" and so on.
p144
aVWe can also get a gender breakdown.
p145
aVAnd we see that women are slightly more prolific
p146
aVtalking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.
p147
aVWe can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram
p148
aVof the world's emotional distribution by age.
p149
aVWe see people in their twenties are the most prolific,
p150
aVfollowed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties,
p151
aVand it dies out very quickly from there.
p152
aVIn weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics
p153
aVof the weather that they represent,
p154
aVso that the ones collected on a sunny day
p155
aVswirl around as if they're part of the sun.
p156
aVThe cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.
p157
aVThe rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm,
p158
aVand the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.
p159
aa(lp160
VFinally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions
p161
aVon a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.
p162
aVMetrics provides more numerical views on the data.
p163
aVWe see that the world is feeling "used"
p164
aVat 3.3 times the normal level right now.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VThey're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.
p169
aVOther views are also available.
p170
aVHere are gender, age, weather, location.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe final movement is called Mounds.
p173
aVIt's a bit different from the others.
p174
aVMounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs
p175
aVwhich kind of jiggle.
p176
aVAnd if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.
p177
aVWe see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."
p178
aVAnd then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,
p179
aVand there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.
p180
aVYou can see the little pink cursor moving along,
p181
aVrepresenting our position.
p182
aVHere we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible."
p183
aa(lp184
VThere's also a search capability,
p185
aVif you're interested in finding out about a certain population.
p186
aVFor instance, you could find women who feel "addicted"
p187
aVin their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VBut I'll spare you that.
p192
aVSo here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected:
p193
aV"I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me."
p194
aV"I feel very lonely."
p195
aV"I need to be in some backwoods redneck town
p196
aVso that I can feel beautiful."
p197
aV"I feel invisible to you."
p198
aV"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to."
p199
aV"I feel in love with Carolyn." "I feel so naughty."
p200
aV"I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
V"I love how I feel today."
p205
aa(lp206
VSo as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique
p207
aVthat I call "passive observation."
p208
aVWhat I mean by that is that it passively observes people
p209
aVas they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs
p210
aVand looks at what people are writing,
p211
aVand these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.
p212
aVAnd because of that,
p213
aVyou end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses
p214
aVthat are often very moving.
p215
aVAnd this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work
p216
aVbecause people don't know they're being interviewed.
p217
aVThey're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnother technique is directly questioning people.
p220
aVAnd this is a technique that I explored in a different project,
p221
aVthe Yahoo! Time Capsule,
p222
aVwhich was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.
p223
aVIt was divided into ten very simple themes \u2014
p224
aVlove, anger, sadness and so on \u2014
p225
aVeach of which contained a single, very open-ended question
p226
aVput to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?
p227
aVWhat makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.
p228
aVThe time capsule was available for one month online,
p229
aVtranslated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.
p230
aVIt's a spinning globe,
p231
aVthe surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures
p232
aVand words and drawings of people
p233
aVthat submitted to the time capsule.
p234
aVThe ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.
p235
aVYou can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.
p236
aVThis is in response to, What's beautiful? "Miss World."
p237
aa(lp238
VThere are two modes to the time capsule.
p239
aVThere's One World, which presents the spinning globe,
p240
aVand Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips
p241
aVand lets you sift through them one by one.
p242
aVSo this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,
p243
aVwhich was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico
p244
aVat the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,
p245
aVthe contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides
p246
aVof the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,
p247
aVwhich stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.
p248
aVAnd we also projected the contents of the time capsule
p249
aVas binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.
p250
aVYou can see the orange line leaving the desert floor
p251
aVat about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing
p252
aVbecause the first night I looked at all this information
p253
aVand really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier \u2014
p254
aVthe differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.
p255
aa(lp256
VBut, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more,
p257
aVand saw these images go across the rocks,
p258
aVI realized I was seeing the same archetypal events
p259
aVdepicted again and again and again.
p260
aVYou know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss,
p261
aVthe first camel or horse \u2014 depending on the culture.
p262
aVAnd it was really moving. And this picture here was taken
p263
aVthe final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,
p264
aVwhere the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.
p265
aVAnd there was something very moving
p266
aVabout all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd it started to make me think a lot about the night sky,
p269
aVand how humans have always used the night sky
p270
aVto project their great stories.
p271
aVYou know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,
p272
aVI would often look up into the dark sky
p273
aVand see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.
p274
aVAnd as an adult, I've been more aware
p275
aVof the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.
p276
aVYou know, Orion facing the roaring bull.
p277
aVPerseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.
p278
aVZeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.
p279
aVI mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd it caused me to wonder about our world today.
p282
aVAnd it caused me to wonder specifically,
p283
aVif we could make new constellations today,
p284
aVwhat would those look like? What would those be?
p285
aVIf we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?
p286
aVWhat are the great stories of today?
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd those are the questions that inspired my new project,
p289
aVwhich is debuting here today at TED.
p290
aVNobody's seen this yet, publicly.
p291
aVIt's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.
p292
aVAnd it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.
p293
aVSo, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo, Universe will open here.
p296
aVAnd you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field,
p297
aVand there's an Aurora Borealis in the background,
p298
aVkind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis
p299
aVcan be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,
p300
aVand we'll put it down here to red.
p301
aVSo you see this kind of \u2014 these stars moving along.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.
p304
aVEach of those stars actually represents
p305
aVa specific event in the real world \u2014
p306
aVa quote that was stated by somebody, an image,
p307
aVa news story, a person, a company. You know,
p308
aVsome kind of heroic personality.
p309
aVAnd you might notice that as the cursor begins
p310
aVto touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.
p311
aVWe see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.
p312
aVAnd we see here a photograph with a head.
p313
aVYou can start to see words emerging here.
p314
aVAnd those are
p315
aVthe constellations of today.
p316
aVAnd I can turn them all on,
p317
aVand you can see them moving across the sky now.
p318
aa(lp319
VThis is the universe of 2007, the last two months.
p320
aVThe data from this is global news coverage
p321
aVfrom thousands of news sources around the world.
p322
aVIt's using the API of a really great company that I work with
p323
aVin New York, actually, called Daylife.
p324
aVAnd it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level
p325
aVof the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford,
p328
aVIraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words \u2014
p329
aVI call them secrets \u2014 and we can cause them to form
p330
aVan alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith
p331
aVplaying a big role recently.
p332
aVPresident Ford \u2014 this is Gerald Ford's funeral.
p333
aVWe can actually click anything in Universe
p334
aVand have it become the center of the universe,
p335
aVand everything else will enter its orbit.
p336
aVSo, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.
p337
aVAnd the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit
p338
aVand swirl around it.
p339
aa(lp340
VWe can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.
p341
aVWe can click on one of those
p342
aVand have the photograph be the center of the universe.
p343
aVNow the things that relate to it are swirling around.
p344
aVWe can click on this and we see this iconic image
p345
aVof Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.
p346
aa(lp347
VIn Universe, there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely,
p348
aVand you can just kind of click on stuff.
p349
aVThis is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.
p350
aVBut we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.
p351
aVSo, if we want to,
p352
aVlet's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.
p353
aVAnd let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.
p354
aVSo now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained
p355
aVto all things Bill Clinton.
p356
aVWe can have his constellations emerge here.
p357
aVWe can pull out his secrets,
p358
aVand we see that it has a lot to do with candidates,
p359
aVHillary, presidential, Barack Obama.
p360
aVWe can see the stories
p361
aVthat Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.
p362
aVAny of those can be opened up.
p363
aVSo we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.
p364
aVYou can see that this is an important story;
p365
aVthere are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up,
p366
aVwe get different perspectives on this story.
p367
aVYou can click any of those to go out and read the article
p368
aVat the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.
p369
aa(lp370
VWe can also see the superstars. These would be the people
p371
aVthat are kind of the looming heroes and heroines
p372
aVin the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary,
p373
aVIraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby \u2014
p374
aVthese are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.
p375
aVWe can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach
p376
aVof Bill Clinton in the last week or so.
p377
aVWe can see he's been focused in America
p378
aVbecause he's been campaigning, probably,
p379
aVbut a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.
p380
aVAnd then we can also see a timeline.
p381
aVSo we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday,
p382
aVbut he was back to work on Sunday morning,
p383
aVand actually been tapering off since then this week.
p384
aa(lp385
VAnd it's not limited to just people or dates,
p386
aVbut we can actually put in concepts also.
p387
aVSo if I put in climate change for all of 2006,
p388
aVwe'll see what that universe looks like.
p389
aVHere we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.
p390
aVHere we have our secrets.
p391
aVSo we see again, climate change is large:
p392
aVNairobi, global conference, environmental.
p393
aVAnd there are also quotes that you can see,
p394
aVif you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.
p395
aVYou know, this is really an infinite thing.
p396
aa(lp397
VThe superstars of climate change in 2006:
p398
aVUnited States, Britain, China. You know,
p399
aVthese are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.
p400
aVSo this is a piece that demands exploration.
p401
aa(lp402
VThis will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.
p403
aVAnd you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore
p404
aVwhat your own personal mythology might be.
p405
aVYou'll notice that in Daylife \u2014 rather, in Universe \u2014
p406
aVit supports both the notion of a global mythology,
p407
aVwhich is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007,
p408
aVand also a personal mythology.
p409
aVAs you search for the things that are important to you in your world,
p410
aVand then see what the constellations of those might look like.
p411
aa(lp412
VSo it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.

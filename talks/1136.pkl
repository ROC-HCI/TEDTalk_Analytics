VPhyllis Rodriguez: We are here today
p5
aVbecause of the fact
p6
aVthat we have what most people consider
p7
aVan unusual friendship.
p8
aVAnd it is.
p9
aVAnd yet, it feels natural to us now.
p10
aa(lp11
VI first learned
p12
aVthat my son had been in the World Trade Center
p13
aVon the morning of September 11th, 2001.
p14
aVWe didn't know
p15
aVif he had perished yet
p16
aVuntil 36 hours later.
p17
aVAt the time,
p18
aVwe knew that it was political.
p19
aVWe were afraid of what our country was going to do
p20
aVin the name of our son \u2014
p21
aVmy husband, Orlando, and I and our family.
p22
aVAnd when I saw it \u2014
p23
aVand yet, through the shock,
p24
aVthe terrible shock,
p25
aVand the terrible explosion in our lives, literally,
p26
aVwe were not vengeful.
p27
aVAnd a couple of weeks later
p28
aVwhen Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted
p29
aVon six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism,
p30
aVand the U.S. government called for a death penalty
p31
aVfor him, if convicted,
p32
aVmy husband and I spoke out
p33
aVin opposition to that, publicly.
p34
aVThrough that
p35
aVand through human rights groups,
p36
aVwe were brought together
p37
aVwith several other victims' families.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhen I saw Aicha in the media,
p40
aVcoming over when her son was indicted,
p41
aVand I thought, "What a brave woman.
p42
aVSomeday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."
p43
aVI was still in deep grief;
p44
aVI knew I didn't have the strength.
p45
aVI knew I would find her someday,
p46
aVor we would find each other.
p47
aVBecause, when people heard that my son was a victim,
p48
aVI got immediate sympathy.
p49
aVBut when people learned
p50
aVwhat her son was accused of,
p51
aVshe didn't get that sympathy.
p52
aVBut her suffering is equal to mine.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo we met in November 2002,
p55
aVand Aicha will now tell you
p56
aVhow that came about.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Translator) Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
p59
aVI am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
p60
aVAnd I asked
p61
aVthe Organization of Human Rights
p62
aVto put me in touch with the parents of the victims.
p63
aVSo they introduced me
p64
aVto five families.
p65
aVAnd I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.
p66
aVShe was the only mother in the group.
p67
aVThe others were brothers, sisters.
p68
aVAnd I saw in her eyes
p69
aVthat she was a mother, just like me.
p70
aVI suffered a lot as a mother.
p71
aVI was married when I was 14.
p72
aVI lost a child when I was 15,
p73
aVa second child when I was 16.
p74
aVSo the story with Zacarias was too much really.
p75
aVAnd I still suffer,
p76
aVbecause my son
p77
aVis like he's buried alive.
p78
aVI know she really cried for her son.
p79
aVBut she knows where he is.
p80
aVMy son, I don't know where he is.
p81
aVI don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.
p82
aVI don't know what happened to him.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo that's why I decided to tell my story,
p85
aVso that my suffering is something positive for other women.
p86
aVFor all the women, all the mothers that give life,
p87
aVyou can give back,
p88
aVyou can change.
p89
aVIt's up to us women,
p90
aVbecause we are women,
p91
aVbecause we love our children.
p92
aVWe must be hand-in-hand
p93
aVand do something together.
p94
aVIt's not against women,
p95
aVit's for us, for us women,
p96
aVfor our children.
p97
aVI talk against violence, against terrorism.
p98
aVI go to schools
p99
aVto talk to young, Muslim girls
p100
aVso they don't accept to be married against their will very young.
p101
aVSo if I can save one of the young girls,
p102
aVand avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did,
p103
aVwell this is something good.
p104
aVThis is why I'm here in front of you.
p105
aa(lp106
VPR: I would like to say
p107
aVthat I have learned so much from Aicha,
p108
aVstarting with that day we had our very first meeting
p109
aVwith other family members \u2014
p110
aVwhich was a very private meeting with security,
p111
aVbecause it was November 2002,
p112
aVand, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country \u2014
p113
aVthose of us family members.
p114
aVBut we were all so nervous.
p115
aV"Why does she want to meet us?"
p116
aVAnd then she was nervous.
p117
aV"Why did we want to meet her?"
p118
aVWhat did we want from each other?
p119
aVBefore we knew each others' names, or anything,
p120
aVwe had embraced and wept.
p121
aVThen we sat in a circle
p122
aVwith support, with help,
p123
aVfrom people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.
p124
aVAnd Aicha started,
p125
aVand she said,
p126
aV"I don't know if my son
p127
aVis guilty or innocent,
p128
aVbut I want to tell you how sorry I am
p129
aVfor what happened to your families.
p130
aVI know what it is to suffer,
p131
aVand I feel that if there is a crime,
p132
aVa person should be tried fairly and punished."
p133
aVBut she reached out to us in that way,
p134
aVand it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.
p135
aVAnd what happened then is we all told our stories,
p136
aVand we all connected as human beings.
p137
aVBy the end of the afternoon \u2014
p138
aVit was about three hours after lunch \u2014
p139
aVwe'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow what I learned from her,
p142
aVis a woman, not only who could be so generous
p143
aVunder these present circumstances
p144
aVand what it was then,
p145
aVand what was being done to her son,
p146
aVbut the life she's had.
p147
aVI never had met
p148
aVsomeone with such a hard life,
p149
aVfrom such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
p150
aVAnd I feel
p151
aVthat we have
p152
aVa special connection,
p153
aVwhich I value very much.
p154
aVAnd I think it's all about
p155
aVbeing afraid of the other,
p156
aVbut making that step
p157
aVand then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.
p158
aVWho else can I meet that I don't know,
p159
aVor that I'm so different from?"
p160
aa(lp161
VSo, Aicha,
p162
aVdo you have a couple of words
p163
aVfor conclusion?
p164
aVBecause our time is up.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
V(Translator) AW: I wanted to say
p169
aVthat we have to try to know other people, the other.
p170
aVYou have to be generous,
p171
aVand your hearts must be generous,
p172
aVyour mind must be generous.
p173
aVYou must be tolerant.
p174
aVYou have to fight against violence.
p175
aVAnd I hope that someday we'll all live together
p176
aVin peace and respecting each other.
p177
aVThis is what I wanted to say.

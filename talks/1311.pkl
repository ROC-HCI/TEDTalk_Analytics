VI've been in Afghanistan for 21 years.
p5
aVI work for the Red Cross
p6
aVand I'm a physical therapist.
p7
aVMy job is to make arms and legs \u2014
p8
aVwell it's not completely true.
p9
aVWe do more than that.
p10
aVWe provide the patients,
p11
aVthe Afghan disabled,
p12
aVfirst with the physical rehabilitation
p13
aVthen with the social reintegration.
p14
aVIt's a very logical plan,
p15
aVbut it was not always like this.
p16
aVFor many years, we were just providing them
p17
aVwith artificial limbs.
p18
aVIt took quite many years
p19
aVfor the program to become what it is now.
p20
aa(lp21
VToday, I would like to tell you a story,
p22
aVthe story of a big change,
p23
aVand the story of the people
p24
aVwho made this change possible.
p25
aVI arrived in Afghanistan
p26
aVin 1990
p27
aVto work in a hospital
p28
aVfor war victims.
p29
aVAnd then, not only for war victims,
p30
aVbut it was for any kind of patient.
p31
aVI was also working
p32
aVin the orthopedic center, we call it.
p33
aVThis is the place where we make the legs.
p34
aVAt that time
p35
aVI found myself
p36
aVin a strange situation.
p37
aVI felt not quite ready
p38
aVfor that job.
p39
aVThere was so much to learn.
p40
aVThere were so many things new to me.
p41
aVBut it was a terrific job.
p42
aVBut as soon as the fighting intensified,
p43
aVthe physical rehabilitation was suspended.
p44
aVThere were many other things to do.
p45
aVSo the orthopedic center was closed
p46
aVbecause physical rehabilitation
p47
aVwas not considered a priority.
p48
aVIt was a strange sensation.
p49
aVAnyway, you know every time I make this speech \u2014
p50
aVit's not the first time \u2014 but it's an emotion.
p51
aVIt's something that comes out from the past.
p52
aVIt's 21 years,
p53
aVbut they are still all there.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnyway, in 1992,
p56
aVthe Mujahideen took all Afghanistan.
p57
aVAnd the orthopedic center was closed.
p58
aVI was assigned to work for the homeless,
p59
aVfor the internally displaced people.
p60
aVBut one day, something happened.
p61
aVI was coming back
p62
aVfrom a big food distribution in a mosque
p63
aVwhere tens and tens of people
p64
aVwere squatting in terrible conditions.
p65
aVI wanted to go home. I was driving.
p66
aVYou know, when you want to forget,
p67
aVyou don't want to see things,
p68
aVso you just want to go to your room, to lock yourself inside
p69
aVand say, "That's enough."
p70
aVA bomb fell not far from my car \u2014
p71
aVwell, far enough, but big noise.
p72
aVAnd everybody disappeared from the street.
p73
aVThe cars disappeared as well.
p74
aVI ducked.
p75
aVAnd only one figure
p76
aVremained in the middle of the road.
p77
aVIt was a man in a wheelchair
p78
aVdesperately trying to move away.
p79
aa(lp80
VWell I'm not a particularly brave person,
p81
aVI have to confess it,
p82
aVbut I could not just ignore him.
p83
aVSo I stopped the car
p84
aVand I went to help.
p85
aVThe man was without legs
p86
aVand only with one arm.
p87
aVBehind him there was a child, his son,
p88
aVred in the face
p89
aVin an effort to push the father.
p90
aVSo I took him into a safe place.
p91
aVAnd I ask, "What are you doing out in the street
p92
aVin this situation?"
p93
aV"I work," he said.
p94
aVI wondered, what work?
p95
aVAnd then I ask an even more stupid question:
p96
aV"Why don't you have the prostheses?
p97
aVWhy don't you have the artificial legs?"
p98
aVAnd he said, "The Red Cross has closed."
p99
aVWell without thinking, I told him
p100
aV"Come tomorrow.
p101
aVWe will provide you with a pair of legs."
p102
aVThe man, his name was Mahmoud,
p103
aVand the child, whose name was Rafi, left.
p104
aVAnd then I said, "Oh, my God. What did I say?
p105
aVThe center is closed,
p106
aVno staff around.
p107
aVMaybe the machinery is broken.
p108
aVWho is going to make the legs for him?"
p109
aVSo I hoped that he would not come.
p110
aVThis is the streets of Kabul
p111
aVin those days.
p112
aVSo I said, "Well I will give him some money."
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd so the following day,
p115
aVI went to the orthopedic center.
p116
aVAnd I spoke with a gatekeeper.
p117
aVI was ready to tell him,
p118
aV"Listen, if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow,
p119
aVplease tell him that it was a mistake.
p120
aVNothing can be done.
p121
aVGive him some money."
p122
aVBut Mahmoud and his son were already there.
p123
aVAnd they were not alone.
p124
aVThere were 15, maybe 20, people like him waiting.
p125
aVAnd there was some staff too.
p126
aVAmong them there was my right-hand man,
p127
aVNajmuddin.
p128
aVAnd the gatekeeper told me,
p129
aV"They come everyday to see if the center will open."
p130
aVI said, "No.
p131
aVWe have to go away. We cannot stay here."
p132
aVThey were bombing \u2014 not very close \u2014 but you could hear the noise of the bombs.
p133
aVSo, "We cannot stay here, it's dangerous.
p134
aVIt's not a priority."
p135
aVBut Najmuddin told me, "Listen now, we're here."
p136
aVAt least we can start repairing the prostheses, the broken prostheses of the people
p137
aVand maybe try to do something
p138
aVfor people like Mahmoud."
p139
aVI said, "No, please. We cannot do that.
p140
aVIt's really dangerous.
p141
aVWe have other things to do."
p142
aVBut they insisted.
p143
aVWhen you have 20 people
p144
aVin front of you, looking at you
p145
aVand you are the one who has to decide ...
p146
aa(lp147
VSo we started doing some repairs.
p148
aVAlso one of the physical therapists
p149
aVreported that Mahmoud
p150
aVcould be provided with a leg,
p151
aVbut not immediately.
p152
aVThe legs were swollen
p153
aVand the knees were stiff,
p154
aVso he needed a long preparation.
p155
aVBelieve me, I was worried
p156
aVbecause I was breaking the rules.
p157
aVI was doing something
p158
aVthat I was not supposed to do.
p159
aVIn the evening,
p160
aVI went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters,
p161
aVand I told them \u2014 I lied \u2014
p162
aVI told them, "Listen, we are going to start
p163
aVa couple of hours per day,
p164
aVjust a few repairs."
p165
aVMaybe some of them are here now.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VSo we started.
p170
aVI was working, I was going everyday
p171
aVto work for the homeless.
p172
aVAnd Najmuddin was staying there,
p173
aVdoing everything and reporting on the patients.
p174
aVHe was telling me, "Patients are coming."
p175
aVWe knew that many more patients
p176
aVcould not come, prevented by the fighting.
p177
aVBut people were coming.
p178
aVAnd Mahmoud was coming every day.
p179
aVAnd slowly, slowly
p180
aVweek after week
p181
aVhis legs were improving.
p182
aVThe stump or cast prosthesis was made,
p183
aVand he was starting
p184
aVthe real physical rehabilitation.
p185
aVHe was coming every day,
p186
aVcrossing the front line.
p187
aVA couple of times I crossed the front line
p188
aVin the very place where Mahmoud and his son were crossing.
p189
aVI tell you, it was something so sinister
p190
aVthat I was astonished he could do it every day.
p191
aa(lp192
VBut finally, the great day arrived.
p193
aVMahmoud was going to be discharged
p194
aVwith his new legs.
p195
aVIt was April, I remember,
p196
aVa very beautiful day.
p197
aVApril in Kabul is beautiful,
p198
aVfull of roses, full of flowers.
p199
aVWe could not possibly stay indoors,
p200
aVwith all these sandbags at the windows.
p201
aVVery sad, dark.
p202
aVSo we chose a small spot in the garden.
p203
aVAnd Mahmoud put on his prostheses,
p204
aVthe other patients did the same,
p205
aVand they started practicing
p206
aVfor the last time before being discharged.
p207
aa(lp208
VSuddenly, they started fighting.
p209
aVTwo groups of Mujahideen started fighting.
p210
aVWe could hear in the air
p211
aVthe bullets passing.
p212
aVSo we dashed, all of us,
p213
aVtowards the shelter.
p214
aVMahmoud grabbed his son, I grabbed someone else.
p215
aVEverybody was grabbing something.
p216
aVAnd we ran.
p217
aVYou know, 50 meters can be a long distance
p218
aVif you are totally exposed,
p219
aVbut we managed to reach the shelter.
p220
aVInside, all of us panting,
p221
aVI sat a moment and I heard Rafi telling his father,
p222
aV"Father, you can run faster than me."
p223
aV(Laughter)
p224
aVAnd Mahmoud, "Of course I can.
p225
aVI can run, and now you can go to school.
p226
aVNo need of staying with me all the day
p227
aVpushing my wheelchair."
p228
aVLater on, we took them home.
p229
aVAnd I will never forget
p230
aVMahmoud and his son walking together
p231
aVpushing the empty wheelchair.
p232
aVAnd then I understood,
p233
aVphysical rehabilitation is a priority.
p234
aVDignity cannot wait for better times.
p235
aa(lp236
VFrom that day on, we never closed a single day.
p237
aVWell sometimes we were suspended for a few hours,
p238
aVbut we never, we never closed it again.
p239
aVI met Mahmoud one year later.
p240
aVHe was in good shape \u2014
p241
aVa bit thinner.
p242
aVHe needed to change his prostheses \u2014
p243
aVa new pair of prostheses.
p244
aVI asked about his son.
p245
aVHe told me, "He's at school. He'd doing quite well."
p246
aVBut I understood he wanted to tell me something.
p247
aVSo I asked him, "What is that?"
p248
aVHe was sweating.
p249
aVHe was clearly embarrassed.
p250
aVAnd he was standing in front of me,
p251
aVhis head down.
p252
aVHe said, "You have taught me to walk.
p253
aVThank you very much.
p254
aVNow help me not to be a beggar anymore."
p255
aVThat was the job.
p256
aV"My children are growing.
p257
aVI feel ashamed.
p258
aVI don't want them to be teased at school
p259
aVby the other students."
p260
aVI said, "Okay."
p261
aVI thought, how much money do I have in my pocket?
p262
aVJust to give him some money.
p263
aVIt was the easiest way.
p264
aVHe read my mind,
p265
aVand he said, "I ask for a job."
p266
aVAnd then he added something
p267
aVI will never forget for the rest of my life.
p268
aVHe said, "I am a scrap of a man,
p269
aVbut if you help me,
p270
aVI'm ready to do anything,
p271
aVeven if I have to crawl on the ground."
p272
aVAnd then he sat down.
p273
aVI sat down too with goosebumps everywhere.
p274
aa(lp275
VLegless, with only one arm,
p276
aVilliterate,
p277
aVunskilled \u2014
p278
aVwhat job for him?
p279
aVNajmuddin told me, "Well we have a vacancy
p280
aVin the carpentry shop."
p281
aV"What?" I said, "Stop."
p282
aV"Well yes, we need to increase the production of feet.
p283
aVWe need to employ someone
p284
aVto glue and to screw the sole of the feet.
p285
aVWe need to increase the production."
p286
aV"Excuse me?"
p287
aVI could not believe.
p288
aVAnd then he said,
p289
aV"No, we can modify the workbench
p290
aVmaybe to put a special stool,
p291
aVa special anvil, special vice,
p292
aVand maybe an electric screwdriver."
p293
aVI said, "Listen, it's insane.
p294
aVAnd it's even cruel to think of anything like this.
p295
aVThat's a production line and a very fast one.
p296
aVIt's cruel
p297
aVto offer him a job
p298
aVknowing that he's going to fail."
p299
aVBut with Najmuddin, we cannot discuss.
p300
aVSo the only things I could manage to obtain
p301
aVwas a kind of a compromise.
p302
aVOnly one week \u2014
p303
aVone week try and not a single day more.
p304
aVOne week later,
p305
aVMahmoud was the fastest in the production line.
p306
aVI told Najmuddin, "That's a trick.
p307
aVI can't believe it."
p308
aVThe production was up 20 percent.
p309
aV"It's a trick, it's a trick," I said.
p310
aVAnd then I asked for verification.
p311
aVIt was true.
p312
aa(lp313
VThe comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove.
p314
aVI understood
p315
aVthat I was wrong again.
p316
aVMahmoud had looked taller.
p317
aVI remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling.
p318
aVHe was a new man,
p319
aVtaller again.
p320
aVOf course, I understood
p321
aVthat what made him stand tall \u2014
p322
aVyeah they were the legs, thank you very much \u2014
p323
aVbut as a first step,
p324
aVit was the dignity.
p325
aVHe has regained his full dignity
p326
aVthanks to that job.
p327
aVSo of course, I understood.
p328
aVAnd then we started a new policy \u2014
p329
aVa new policy completely different.
p330
aVWe decided to employ
p331
aVas many disabled as possible
p332
aVto train them in any possible job.
p333
aVIt became a policy of "positive discrimination,"
p334
aVwe call it now.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd you know what?
p337
aVIt's good for everybody.
p338
aVEverybody benefits from that \u2014
p339
aVthose employed, of course,
p340
aVbecause they get a job
p341
aVand dignity.
p342
aVBut also for the newcomers.
p343
aVThey are 7,000 every year \u2014
p344
aVpeople coming for the first time.
p345
aVAnd you should see the faces of these people
p346
aVwhen they realize that those assisting them are like them.
p347
aVSometimes you see them,
p348
aVthey look, "Oh."
p349
aVAnd you see the faces.
p350
aVAnd then the surprise turns into hope.
p351
aVAnd it's easy for me as well to train someone
p352
aVwho has already passed through the experience of disability.
p353
aVPoof, they learn much faster \u2014 the motivation,
p354
aVthe empathy they can establish with the patient
p355
aVis completely different, completely.
p356
aVScraps of men do not exist.
p357
aa(lp358
VPeople like Mahmoud
p359
aVare agents of change.
p360
aVAnd when you start changing, you cannot stop.
p361
aVSo employing people, yes,
p362
aVbut also we started programming projects
p363
aVof microfinance, education.
p364
aVAnd when you start, you cannot stop.
p365
aVSo you do vocational training,
p366
aVhome education for those who cannot go to school.
p367
aVPhysical therapies can be done, not only in the orthopedic center,
p368
aVbut also in the houses of the people.
p369
aVThere is always a better way to do things.
p370
aVThat's Najmuddin, the one with the white coat.
p371
aVTerrible Najmuddin, is that one.
p372
aVI have learned a lot
p373
aVfrom people like Najmuddin, Mahmoud, Rafi.
p374
aVThey are my teachers.
p375
aa(lp376
VI have a wish, a big wish,
p377
aVthat this way of working, this way of thinking,
p378
aVis going to be implemented in other countries.
p379
aVThere are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan.
p380
aVIt is possible and it is not difficult.
p381
aVAll we have to do
p382
aVis to listen to the people
p383
aVthat we are supposed assist,
p384
aVto make them part
p385
aVof the decision-making process
p386
aVand then, of course, to adapt.
p387
aVThis is my big wish.
p388
aa(lp389
VWell don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over;
p390
aVnot at all. We are going on.
p391
aVRecently we have just started a program,
p392
aVa sport program \u2014
p393
aVbasketball for wheelchair users.
p394
aVWe transport the wheelchairs everywhere.
p395
aVWe have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan.
p396
aVAt the beginning,
p397
aVwhen Anajulina told me,
p398
aV"We would like to start it,"
p399
aVI hesitated.
p400
aVI said, "No," you can imagine.
p401
aVI said, "No, no, no, no, we can't."
p402
aVAnd then I asked the usual question:
p403
aV"Is it a priority?
p404
aVIs it really necessary?"
p405
aVWell now you should see me.
p406
aVI never miss a single training session.
p407
aVThe night before a match I'm very nervous.
p408
aVAnd you should see me during the match.
p409
aVI shout like a true Italian.
p410
aa(lp411
V(Laughter)
p412
aa(lp413
VWhat's next? What is going to be the next change?
p414
aVWell I don't know yet,
p415
aVbut I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends,
p416
aVthey have it already in mind.
p417
aa(lp418
VThat was my story. Thank you very much.
p419

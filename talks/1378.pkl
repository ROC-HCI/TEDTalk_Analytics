VWell this is a really extraordinary honor for me.
p5
aVI spend most of my time
p6
aVin jails, in prisons, on death row.
p7
aVI spend most of my time in very low-income communities
p8
aVin the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness.
p9
aVAnd being here at TED
p10
aVand seeing the stimulation, hearing it,
p11
aVhas been very, very energizing to me.
p12
aVAnd one of the things that's emerged in my short time here
p13
aVis that TED has an identity.
p14
aVAnd you can actually say things here
p15
aVthat have impacts around the world.
p16
aVAnd sometimes when it comes through TED,
p17
aVit has meaning and power
p18
aVthat it doesn't have when it doesn't.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd I mention that because I think identity is really important.
p21
aVAnd we've had some fantastic presentations.
p22
aVAnd I think what we've learned
p23
aVis that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful,
p24
aVbut if you're a compassionate teacher,
p25
aVthey can be especially meaningful.
p26
aVIf you're a doctor you can do some good things,
p27
aVbut if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things.
p28
aVAnd so I want to talk about the power of identity.
p29
aVAnd I didn't learn about this actually
p30
aVpracticing law and doing the work that I do.
p31
aVI actually learned about this from my grandmother.
p32
aa(lp33
VI grew up in a house
p34
aVthat was the traditional African-American home
p35
aVthat was dominated by a matriarch,
p36
aVand that matriarch was my grandmother.
p37
aVShe was tough, she was strong,
p38
aVshe was powerful.
p39
aVShe was the end of every argument in our family.
p40
aVShe was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.
p41
aVShe was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.
p42
aVHer parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's.
p43
aVShe was born in the 1880's
p44
aVand the experience of slavery
p45
aVvery much shaped the way she saw the world.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.
p48
aVWhen I would see her as a little boy,
p49
aVshe'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs.
p50
aVAnd she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe
p51
aVand then she'd let me go.
p52
aVAnd an hour or two later, if I saw her,
p53
aVshe'd come over to me and she'd say, "Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?"
p54
aVAnd if I said, "No," she'd assault me again,
p55
aVand if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone.
p56
aVAnd she just had this quality
p57
aVthat you always wanted to be near her.
p58
aVAnd the only challenge was that she had 10 children.
p59
aVMy mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
p60
aVAnd sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,
p61
aVit would be difficult to get her time and attention.
p62
aVMy cousins would be running around everywhere.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old,
p65
aVwaking up one morning, going into the living room,
p66
aVand all of my cousins were running around.
p67
aVAnd my grandmother was sitting across the room
p68
aVstaring at me.
p69
aVAnd at first I thought we were playing a game.
p70
aVAnd I would look at her and I'd smile,
p71
aVbut she was very serious.
p72
aVAnd after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,
p73
aVshe got up and she came across the room
p74
aVand she took me by the hand
p75
aVand she said, "Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk."
p76
aVAnd I remember this just like it happened yesterday.
p77
aVI never will forget it.
p78
aa(lp79
VShe took me out back and she said, "Bryan, I'm going to tell you something,
p80
aVbut you don't tell anybody what I tell you."
p81
aVI said, "Okay, Mama."
p82
aVShe said, "Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "Sure."
p83
aVThen she sat me down and she looked at me
p84
aVand she said, "I want you to know
p85
aVI've been watching you."
p86
aVAnd she said, "I think you're special."
p87
aVShe said, "I think you can do anything you want to do."
p88
aVI will never forget it.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan."
p91
aVI said, "Okay, Mama."
p92
aVShe said, "The first thing I want you to promise me
p93
aVis that you'll always love your mom."
p94
aVShe said, "That's my baby girl,
p95
aVand you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her."
p96
aVWell I adored my mom, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."
p97
aVThen she said, "The second thing I want you to promise me
p98
aVis that you'll always do the right thing
p99
aVeven when the right thing is the hard thing."
p100
aVAnd I thought about it and I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."
p101
aVThen finally she said, "The third thing I want you to promise me
p102
aVis that you'll never drink alcohol."
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVWell I was nine years old, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."
p105
aa(lp106
VI grew up in the country in the rural South,
p107
aVand I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.
p108
aVWhen I was about 14 or 15,
p109
aVone day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer \u2014
p110
aVI don't know where he got it \u2014
p111
aVand he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods.
p112
aVAnd we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did.
p113
aVAnd he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some,
p114
aVand they offered it to me.
p115
aVI said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer."
p116
aVMy brother said, "Come on. We're doing this today; you always do what we do.
p117
aVI had some, your sister had some. Have some beer."
p118
aVI said, "No, I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead."
p119
aVAnd then my brother started staring at me.
p120
aVHe said, "What's wrong with you? Have some beer."
p121
aVThen he looked at me real hard and he said,
p122
aV"Oh, I hope you're not still hung up
p123
aVon that conversation Mama had with you."
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVI said, "Well, what are you talking about?"
p126
aVHe said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special."
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVI was devastated.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd I'm going to admit something to you.
p133
aVI'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't.
p134
aVI know this might be broadcast broadly.
p135
aVBut I'm 52 years old,
p136
aVand I'm going to admit to you
p137
aVthat I've never had a drop of alcohol.
p138
aV(Applause)
p139
aVI don't say that because I think that's virtuous;
p140
aVI say that because there is power in identity.
p141
aVWhen we create the right kind of identity,
p142
aVwe can say things to the world around us
p143
aVthat they don't actually believe makes sense.
p144
aVWe can get them to do things
p145
aVthat they don't think they can do.
p146
aVWhen I thought about my grandmother,
p147
aVof course she would think all her grandkids were special.
p148
aVMy grandfather was in prison during prohibition.
p149
aVMy male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases.
p150
aVAnd these were the things she thought we needed to commit to.
p151
aa(lp152
VWell I've been trying to say something
p153
aVabout our criminal justice system.
p154
aVThis country is very different today
p155
aVthan it was 40 years ago.
p156
aVIn 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.
p157
aVToday, there are 2.3 million.
p158
aVThe United States now has the highest rate of incarceration
p159
aVin the world.
p160
aVWe have seven million people on probation and parole.
p161
aVAnd mass incarceration, in my judgment,
p162
aVhas fundamentally changed our world.
p163
aVIn poor communities, in communities of color
p164
aVthere is this despair,
p165
aVthere is this hopelessness,
p166
aVthat is being shaped by these outcomes.
p167
aVOne out of three black men
p168
aVbetween the ages of 18 and 30
p169
aVis in jail, in prison, on probation or parole.
p170
aVIn urban communities across this country \u2014
p171
aVLos Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington \u2014
p172
aV50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are
p173
aVin jail or prison or on probation or parole.
p174
aa(lp175
VOur system isn't just being shaped
p176
aVin these ways that seem to be distorting around race,
p177
aVthey're also distorted by poverty.
p178
aVWe have a system of justice in this country
p179
aVthat treats you much better
p180
aVif you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
p181
aVWealth, not culpability,
p182
aVshapes outcomes.
p183
aVAnd yet, we seem to be very comfortable.
p184
aVThe politics of fear and anger
p185
aVhave made us believe
p186
aVthat these are problems that are not our problems.
p187
aVWe've been disconnected.
p188
aa(lp189
VIt's interesting to me.
p190
aVWe're looking at some very interesting developments in our work.
p191
aVMy state of Alabama, like a number of states,
p192
aVactually permanently disenfranchises you
p193
aVif you have a criminal conviction.
p194
aVRight now in Alabama
p195
aV34 percent of the black male population
p196
aVhas permanently lost the right to vote.
p197
aVWe're actually projecting in another 10 years
p198
aVthe level of disenfranchisement
p199
aVwill be as high as it's been
p200
aVsince prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.
p201
aVAnd there is this stunning silence.
p202
aa(lp203
VI represent children.
p204
aVA lot of my clients are very young.
p205
aVThe United States is the only country in the world
p206
aVwhere we sentence 13-year-old children
p207
aVto die in prison.
p208
aVWe have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country.
p209
aVAnd we're actually doing some litigation.
p210
aVThe only country in the world.
p211
aa(lp212
VI represent people on death row.
p213
aVIt's interesting, this question of the death penalty.
p214
aVIn many ways, we've been taught to think
p215
aVthat the real question is,
p216
aVdo people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed?
p217
aVAnd that's a very sensible question.
p218
aVBut there's another way of thinking
p219
aVabout where we are in our identity.
p220
aVThe other way of thinking about it
p221
aVis not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit,
p222
aVbut do we deserve to kill?
p223
aVI mean, it's fascinating.
p224
aa(lp225
VDeath penalty in America is defined by error.
p226
aVFor every nine people who have been executed,
p227
aVwe've actually identified one innocent person
p228
aVwho's been exonerated and released from death row.
p229
aVA kind of astonishing error rate \u2014
p230
aVone out of nine people innocent.
p231
aVI mean, it's fascinating.
p232
aVIn aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes
p233
aVif for every nine planes that took off
p234
aVone would crash.
p235
aVBut somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.
p236
aVIt's not our problem.
p237
aVIt's not our burden.
p238
aVIt's not our struggle.
p239
aa(lp240
VI talk a lot about these issues.
p241
aVI talk about race and this question
p242
aVof whether we deserve to kill.
p243
aVAnd it's interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history,
p244
aVI tell them about slavery.
p245
aVI tell them about terrorism,
p246
aVthe era that began at the end of reconstruction
p247
aVthat went on to World War II.
p248
aVWe don't really know very much about it.
p249
aVBut for African-Americans in this country,
p250
aVthat was an era defined by terror.
p251
aVIn many communities, people had to worry about being lynched.
p252
aVThey had to worry about being bombed.
p253
aVIt was the threat of terror that shaped their lives.
p254
aVAnd these older people come up to me now
p255
aVand they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches,
p256
aVyou tell people to stop saying
p257
aVwe're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history
p258
aVafter 9/11."
p259
aVThey tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that."
p260
aVAnd that era of terrorism, of course,
p261
aVwas followed by segregation
p262
aVand decades of racial subordination
p263
aVand apartheid.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd yet, we have in this country this dynamic
p266
aVwhere we really don't like to talk about our problems.
p267
aVWe don't like to talk about our history.
p268
aVAnd because of that, we really haven't understood
p269
aVwhat it's meant to do the things we've done historically.
p270
aVWe're constantly running into each other.
p271
aVWe're constantly creating tensions and conflicts.
p272
aVWe have a hard time talking about race,
p273
aVand I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves
p274
aVto a process of truth and reconciliation.
p275
aVIn South Africa, people understood
p276
aVthat we couldn't overcome apartheid
p277
aVwithout a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
p278
aVIn Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment,
p279
aVbut in this country we haven't done that.
p280
aa(lp281
VI was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty.
p282
aVIt was fascinating
p283
aVbecause one of the scholars stood up after the presentation
p284
aVand said, "Well you know it's deeply troubling
p285
aVto hear what you're talking about."
p286
aVHe said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany.
p287
aVAnd of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany."
p288
aVAnd the room got very quiet,
p289
aVand this woman said,
p290
aV"There's no way, with our history,
p291
aVwe could ever engage
p292
aVin the systematic killing of human beings.
p293
aVIt would be unconscionable for us
p294
aVto, in an intentional and deliberate way,
p295
aVset about executing people."
p296
aVAnd I thought about that.
p297
aVWhat would it feel like
p298
aVto be living in a world
p299
aVwhere the nation state of Germany was executing people,
p300
aVespecially if they were disproportionately Jewish?
p301
aVI couldn't bear it.
p302
aVIt would be unconscionable.
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd yet, in this country,
p305
aVin the states of the Old South,
p306
aVwe execute people \u2014
p307
aVwhere you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty
p308
aVif the victim is white than if the victim is black,
p309
aV22 times more likely to get it
p310
aVif the defendant is black and the victim is white \u2014
p311
aVin the very states where there are buried in the ground
p312
aVthe bodies of people who were lynched.
p313
aVAnd yet, there is this disconnect.
p314
aa(lp315
VWell I believe that our identity is at risk.
p316
aVThat when we actually don't care
p317
aVabout these difficult things,
p318
aVthe positive and wonderful things
p319
aVare nonetheless implicated.
p320
aVWe love innovation.
p321
aVWe love technology. We love creativity.
p322
aVWe love entertainment.
p323
aVBut ultimately,
p324
aVthose realities
p325
aVare shadowed by suffering,
p326
aVabuse, degradation,
p327
aVmarginalization.
p328
aVAnd for me, it becomes necessary
p329
aVto integrate the two.
p330
aVBecause ultimately we are talking
p331
aVabout a need to be more hopeful,
p332
aVmore committed, more dedicated
p333
aVto the basic challenges of living in a complex world.
p334
aVAnd for me that means
p335
aVspending time thinking and talking
p336
aVabout the poor, the disadvantaged,
p337
aVthose who will never get to TED.
p338
aVBut thinking about them in a way
p339
aVthat is integrated in our own lives.
p340
aa(lp341
VYou know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen.
p342
aVWe do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are.
p343
aVInnovation, creativity,
p344
aVdevelopment comes
p345
aVnot from the ideas in our mind alone.
p346
aVThey come from the ideas in our mind
p347
aVthat are also fueled
p348
aVby some conviction in our heart.
p349
aVAnd it's that mind-heart connection
p350
aVthat I believe compels us
p351
aVto not just be attentive
p352
aVto all the bright and dazzly things,
p353
aVbut also the dark and difficult things.
p354
aVVaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.
p355
aVHe said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression,
p356
aVwe wanted all kinds of things,
p357
aVbut mostly what we needed was hope,
p358
aVan orientation of the spirit,
p359
aVa willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places
p360
aVand be a witness."
p361
aa(lp362
VWell that orientation of the spirit
p363
aVis very much at the core of what I believe
p364
aVeven TED communities
p365
aVhave to be engaged in.
p366
aVThere is no disconnect
p367
aVaround technology and design
p368
aVthat will allow us to be fully human
p369
aVuntil we pay attention to suffering,
p370
aVto poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.
p371
aVNow I will warn you
p372
aVthat this kind of identity
p373
aVis a much more challenging identity
p374
aVthan ones that don't pay attention to this.
p375
aVIt will get to you.
p376
aa(lp377
VI had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.
p378
aVAnd Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then,
p379
aVand she would get together with two of her dearest friends,
p380
aVthese older women,
p381
aVJohnnie Carr who was the organizer
p382
aVof the Montgomery bus boycott \u2014
p383
aVamazing African-American woman \u2014
p384
aVand Virginia Durr, a white woman,
p385
aVwhose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.
p386
aVAnd these women would get together and just talk.
p387
aa(lp388
VAnd every now and then Ms. Carr would call me,
p389
aVand she'd say, "Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk.
p390
aVDo you want to come over and listen?"
p391
aVAnd I'd say, "Yes, Ma'am, I do."
p392
aVAnd she'd say, "Well what are you going to do when you get here?"
p393
aVI said, "I'm going to listen."
p394
aVAnd I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen.
p395
aVIt would be so energizing and so empowering.
p396
aa(lp397
VAnd one time I was over there listening to these women talk,
p398
aVand after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me
p399
aVand she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is.
p400
aVTell me what you're trying to do."
p401
aVAnd I began giving her my rap.
p402
aVI said, "Well we're trying to challenge injustice.
p403
aVWe're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted.
p404
aVWe're trying to confront bias and discrimination
p405
aVin the administration of criminal justice.
p406
aVWe're trying to end life without parole sentences for children.
p407
aVWe're trying to do something about the death penalty.
p408
aVWe're trying to reduce the prison population.
p409
aVWe're trying to end mass incarceration."
p410
aa(lp411
VI gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me
p412
aVand she said, "Mmm mmm mmm."
p413
aVShe said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired."
p414
aV(Laughter)
p415
aVAnd that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face,
p416
aVshe said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."
p417
aa(lp418
VAnd I actually believe that the TED community
p419
aVneeds to be more courageous.
p420
aVWe need to find ways
p421
aVto embrace these challenges,
p422
aVthese problems, the suffering.
p423
aVBecause ultimately, our humanity depends
p424
aVon everyone's humanity.
p425
aVI've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.
p426
aVIt's just taught me very simple things.
p427
aVI've come to understand and to believe
p428
aVthat each of us
p429
aVis more than the worst thing we've ever done.
p430
aVI believe that for every person on the planet.
p431
aVI think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.
p432
aVI think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them,
p433
aVthey're not just a thief.
p434
aVI think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer.
p435
aVAnd because of that there's this basic human dignity
p436
aVthat must be respected by law.
p437
aVI also believe
p438
aVthat in many parts of this country,
p439
aVand certainly in many parts of this globe,
p440
aVthat the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
p441
aVI don't believe that.
p442
aVI actually think, in too many places,
p443
aVthe opposite of poverty is justice.
p444
aa(lp445
VAnd finally, I believe
p446
aVthat, despite the fact that it is so dramatic
p447
aVand so beautiful and so inspiring
p448
aVand so stimulating,
p449
aVwe will ultimately not be judged by our technology,
p450
aVwe won't be judged by our design,
p451
aVwe won't be judged by our intellect and reason.
p452
aVUltimately, you judge the character of a society,
p453
aVnot by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged,
p454
aVbut by how they treat the poor,
p455
aVthe condemned, the incarcerated.
p456
aVBecause it's in that nexus
p457
aVthat we actually begin to understand truly profound things
p458
aVabout who we are.
p459
aa(lp460
VI sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story.
p461
aVI sometimes push too hard.
p462
aVI do get tired, as we all do.
p463
aVSometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking
p464
aVin ways that are important.
p465
aVAnd I've been representing these kids
p466
aVwho have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.
p467
aVAnd I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14,
p468
aVand he's been certified to stand trial as an adult.
p469
aVI start thinking, well, how did that happen?
p470
aVHow can a judge turn you into something
p471
aVthat you're not?
p472
aVAnd the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.
p473
aa(lp474
VAnd I was up too late one night and I starting thinking,
p475
aVwell gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not,
p476
aVthe judge must have magic power.
p477
aVYeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.
p478
aVYou should ask for some of that.
p479
aVAnd because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight,
p480
aVI started working on a motion.
p481
aVAnd I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.
p482
aVAnd I started working on this motion,
p483
aVand the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor,
p484
aV14-year-old black male client
p485
aVlike a privileged, white 75-year-old
p486
aVcorporate executive."
p487
aa(lp488
V(Applause)
p489
aa(lp490
VAnd I put in my motion
p491
aVthat there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.
p492
aVThere was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county,
p493
aVit's all misconduct.
p494
aVAnd the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion,
p495
aVor did I actually write it?
p496
aVAnd to my horror, not only had I written it,
p497
aVbut I had sent it to court.
p498
aa(lp499
V(Applause)
p500
aa(lp501
VA couple months went by,
p502
aVand I had just forgotten all about it.
p503
aVAnd I finally decided,
p504
aVoh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.
p505
aVAnd I got into my car
p506
aVand I was feeling really overwhelmed \u2014 overwhelmed.
p507
aVAnd I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.
p508
aVAnd I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful.
p509
aVAnd I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse.
p510
aa(lp511
VAnd as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse,
p512
aVthere was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.
p513
aVWhen this man saw me, he came over to me
p514
aVand he said, "Who are you?"
p515
aVI said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir."
p516
aVAnd this man came over to me
p517
aVand he hugged me.
p518
aVAnd he whispered in my ear.
p519
aVHe said, "I'm so proud of you."
p520
aVAnd I have to tell you,
p521
aVit was energizing.
p522
aVIt connected deeply with something in me
p523
aVabout identity,
p524
aVabout the capacity of every person to contribute
p525
aVto a community, to a perspective that is hopeful.
p526
aa(lp527
VWell I went into the courtroom.
p528
aVAnd as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.
p529
aVHe said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?"
p530
aVI said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing.
p531
aVAnd people started coming in because they were just outraged.
p532
aVI had written these crazy things.
p533
aVAnd police officers were coming in
p534
aVand assistant prosecutors and clerk workers.
p535
aVAnd before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people
p536
aVangry that we were talking about race,
p537
aVthat we were talking about poverty,
p538
aVthat we were talking about inequality.
p539
aa(lp540
VAnd out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth.
p541
aVAnd he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler.
p542
aVHe kept pacing back and forth.
p543
aVAnd finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face
p544
aVcame into the courtroom and sat down behind me,
p545
aValmost at counsel table.
p546
aVAbout 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.
p547
aVAnd during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended
p548
aVthat the janitor had come into court.
p549
aVAnd this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.
p550
aVHe said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?"
p551
aVAnd this older black man stood up
p552
aVand he looked at that deputy and he looked at me
p553
aVand he said, "I came into this courtroom
p554
aVto tell this young man,
p555
aVkeep your eyes on the prize, hold on."
p556
aa(lp557
VI've come to TED
p558
aVbecause I believe that many of you understand
p559
aVthat the moral arc of the universe is long,
p560
aVbut it bends toward justice.
p561
aVThat we cannot be full evolved human beings
p562
aVuntil we care about human rights and basic dignity.
p563
aVThat all of our survival
p564
aVis tied to the survival of everyone.
p565
aVThat our visions of technology and design
p566
aVand entertainment and creativity
p567
aVhave to be married with visions
p568
aVof humanity, compassion and justice.
p569
aVAnd more than anything,
p570
aVfor those of you who share that,
p571
aVI've simply come to tell you
p572
aVto keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.
p573
aa(lp574
VThank you very much.
p575
aa(lp576
V(Applause)
p577
aa(lp578
VChris Anderson: So you heard and saw
p579
aVan obvious desire by this audience, this community,
p580
aVto help you on your way and to do something on this issue.
p581
aVOther than writing a check,
p582
aVwhat could we do?
p583
aa(lp584
VBS: Well there are opportunities all around us.
p585
aVIf you live in the state of California, for example,
p586
aVthere's a referendum coming up this spring
p587
aVwhere actually there's going to be an effort
p588
aVto redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.
p589
aVFor example, here in California
p590
aVwe're going to spend one billion dollars
p591
aVon the death penalty in the next five years \u2014
p592
aVone billion dollars.
p593
aVAnd yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases
p594
aVdon't result in arrest.
p595
aV56 percent of all rape cases don't result.
p596
aVSo there's an opportunity to change that.
p597
aVAnd this referendum would propose having those dollars
p598
aVgo to law enforcement and safety.
p599
aVAnd I think that opportunity exists all around us.
p600
aa(lp601
VCA: There's been this huge decline
p602
aVin crime in America over the last three decades.
p603
aVAnd part of the narrative of that
p604
aVis sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates.
p605
aVWhat would you say to someone who believed that?
p606
aa(lp607
VBS: Well actually the violent crime rate
p608
aVhas remained relatively stable.
p609
aVThe great increase in mass incarceration in this country
p610
aVwasn't really in violent crime categories.
p611
aVIt was this misguided war on drugs.
p612
aVThat's where the dramatic increases have come
p613
aVin our prison population.
p614
aVAnd we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.
p615
aVAnd so we have three strikes laws
p616
aVthat put people in prison forever
p617
aVfor stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,
p618
aVrather than making them give those resources back
p619
aVto the people who they victimized.
p620
aVI believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,
p621
aVnot do less.
p622
aVAnd I think our current punishment philosophy
p623
aVdoes nothing for no one.
p624
aVAnd I think that's the orientation that we have to change.
p625
aa(lp626
V(Applause)
p627
aa(lp628
VCA: Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here.
p629
aVYou're an inspiring person.
p630
aVThank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you.

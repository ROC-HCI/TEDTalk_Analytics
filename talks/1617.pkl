VEverything I do, and everything I do professionally \u2014
p5
aVmy life \u2014 has been shaped
p6
aVby seven years of work as a young man in Africa.
p7
aVFrom 1971 to 1977 \u2014
p8
aVI look young, but I'm not \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p9
aVI worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia,
p10
aVin projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
p11
aa(lp12
VI worked for an Italian NGO,
p13
aVand every single project that we set up in Africa
p14
aVfailed.
p15
aVAnd I was distraught.
p16
aVI thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people
p17
aVand we were doing good work in Africa.
p18
aVInstead, everything we touched we killed.
p19
aa(lp20
VOur first project, the one that has inspired my first book,
p21
aV"Ripples from the Zambezi,"
p22
aVwas a project where we Italians
p23
aVdecided to teach Zambian people how to grow food.
p24
aVSo we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia
p25
aVin this absolutely magnificent valley
p26
aVgoing down to the Zambezi River,
p27
aVand we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes
p28
aVand zucchini and ...
p29
aVAnd of course the local people had absolutely no interest
p30
aVin doing that, so we paid them to come and work,
p31
aVand sometimes they would show up. (Laughter)
p32
aVAnd we were amazed that the local people,
p33
aVin such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.
p34
aVBut instead of asking them how come they were not
p35
aVgrowing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." (Laughter)
p36
aV"Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation."
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully.
p39
aVWe had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato
p40
aVwould grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
p41
aVAnd we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,
p42
aV"Look how easy agriculture is."
p43
aVWhen the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,
p44
aVovernight, some 200 hippos came out from the river
p45
aVand they ate everything. (Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!"
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." (Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
V"Why didn't you tell us?""You never asked."
p52
aa(lp53
VI thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,
p54
aVbut then I saw what the Americans were doing,
p55
aVwhat the English were doing, what the French were doing,
p56
aVand after seeing what they were doing,
p57
aVI became quite proud of our project in Zambia.
p58
aVBecause, you see, at least we fed the hippos.
p59
aa(lp60
VYou should see the rubbish \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p61
aVYou should see the rubbish that we have bestowed
p62
aVon unsuspecting African people.
p63
aVYou want to read the book,
p64
aVread "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo,
p65
aVZambian woman economist.
p66
aVThe book was published in 2009.
p67
aVWe Western donor countries have given the African continent
p68
aVtwo trillion American dollars in the last 50 years.
p69
aVI'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done.
p70
aVJust go and read her book.
p71
aVRead it from an African woman, the damage that we have done.
p72
aa(lp73
VWe Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries,
p74
aVand there are only two ways we deal with people:
p75
aVWe either patronize them, or we are paternalistic.
p76
aVThe two words come from the Latin root "pater,"
p77
aVwhich means "father."
p78
aVBut they mean two different things.
p79
aVPaternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture
p80
aVas if they were my children. "I love you so much."
p81
aVPatronizing, I treat everybody from another culture
p82
aVas if they were my servants.
p83
aVThat's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss.
p84
aa(lp85
VI was given a slap in the face reading a book,
p86
aV"Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said,
p87
aVabove all in economic development, if people
p88
aVdo not wish to be helped, leave them alone.
p89
aVThis should be the first principle of aid.
p90
aVThe first principle of aid is respect.
p91
aVThis morning, the gentleman who opened this conference
p92
aVlay a stick on the floor, and said,
p93
aV"Can we \u2014 can you imagine a city
p94
aVthat is not neocolonial?"
p95
aa(lp96
VI decided when I was 27 years old
p97
aVto only respond to people,
p98
aVand I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation,
p99
aVwhere you never initiate anything,
p100
aVyou never motivate anybody, but you become a servant
p101
aVof the local passion, the servant of local people
p102
aVwho have a dream to become a better person.
p103
aVSo what you do \u2014 you shut up.
p104
aVYou never arrive in a community with any ideas,
p105
aVand you sit with the local people.
p106
aVWe don't work from offices.
p107
aVWe meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub.
p108
aVWe have zero infrastructure.
p109
aVAnd what we do, we become friends,
p110
aVand we find out what that person wants to do.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe most important thing is passion.
p113
aVYou can give somebody an idea.
p114
aVIf that person doesn't want to do it,
p115
aVwhat are you going to do?
p116
aVThe passion that the person has for her own growth
p117
aVis the most important thing.
p118
aVThe passion that that man has for his own personal growth
p119
aVis the most important thing.
p120
aVAnd then we help them to go and find the knowledge,
p121
aVbecause nobody in the world can succeed alone.
p122
aVThe person with the idea may not have the knowledge,
p123
aVbut the knowledge is available.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo years and years ago, I had this idea:
p126
aVWhy don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community
p127
aVto tell people what to do, why don't, for once,
p128
aVlisten to them? But not in community meetings.
p129
aa(lp130
VLet me tell you a secret.
p131
aVThere is a problem with community meetings.
p132
aVEntrepreneurs never come,
p133
aVand they never tell you, in a public meeting,
p134
aVwhat they want to do with their own money,
p135
aVwhat opportunity they have identified.
p136
aVSo planning has this blind spot.
p137
aVThe smartest people in your community you don't even know,
p138
aVbecause they don't come to your public meetings.
p139
aa(lp140
VWhat we do, we work one-on-one,
p141
aVand to work one-on-one, you have to create
p142
aVa social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
p143
aVYou have to create a new profession.
p144
aVThe profession is the family doctor of enterprise,
p145
aVthe family doctor of business, who sits with you
p146
aVin your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe,
p147
aVand helps you find the resources to transform your passion
p148
aVinto a way to make a living.
p149
aa(lp150
VI started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia.
p151
aVI was a doing a Ph.D. at the time,
p152
aVtrying to go away from this patronizing bullshit
p153
aVthat we arrive and tell you what to do.
p154
aVAnd so what I did in Esperance that first year
p155
aVwas to just walk the streets, and in three days
p156
aVI had my first client, and I helped this first guy
p157
aVwho was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy,
p158
aVand I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth,
p159
aVto get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say,
p160
aV"You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?"
p161
aVAnd I helped these five fishermen to work together
p162
aVand get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany
p163
aVfor 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way
p164
aVto take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo,
p165
aVand the farmers came to talk to me, said,
p166
aV"Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"
p167
aVIn a year, I had 27 projects going on,
p168
aVand the government came to see me to say,
p169
aV"How can you do that?
p170
aVHow can you do \u2014 ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.
p171
aVI shut up, and listen to them." (Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VSo \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p174
aVSo the government says, "Do it again." (Laughter)
p175
aVWe've done it in 300 communities around the world.
p176
aVWe have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
p177
aVThere is a new generation of entrepreneurs
p178
aVwho are dying of solitude.
p179
aa(lp180
VPeter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history,
p181
aVdied age 96, a few years ago.
p182
aVPeter Drucker was a professor of philosophy
p183
aVbefore becoming involved in business,
p184
aVand this is what Peter Drucker says:
p185
aV"Planning is actually incompatible
p186
aVwith an entrepreneurial society and economy."
p187
aVPlanning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo now you're rebuilding Christchurch
p190
aVwithout knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch
p191
aVwant to do with their own money and their own energy.
p192
aVYou have to learn how to get these people
p193
aVto come and talk to you.
p194
aVYou have to offer them confidentiality, privacy,
p195
aVyou have to be fantastic at helping them,
p196
aVand then they will come, and they will come in droves.
p197
aVIn a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
p198
aVCan you imagine a community of 400,000 people,
p199
aVthe intelligence and the passion?
p200
aVWhich presentation have you applauded the most this morning?
p201
aVLocal, passionate people. That's who you have applauded.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo what I'm saying is that
p204
aVentrepreneurship is where it's at.
p205
aVWe are at the end of the first industrial revolution \u2014
p206
aVnonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing \u2014
p207
aVand all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable.
p208
aVThe internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
p209
aVFreon way of maintaining things is not sustainable.
p210
aVWhat we have to look at is at how we
p211
aVfeed, cure, educate, transport, communicate
p212
aVfor seven billion people in a sustainable way.
p213
aVThe technologies do not exist to do that.
p214
aVWho is going to invent the technology
p215
aVfor the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it!
p216
aVGovernment? Forget about it!
p217
aVIt will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.
p218
aa(lp219
VThere's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine
p220
aVmany, many years ago.
p221
aVThere was a group of experts who were invited
p222
aVto discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.
p223
aVAnd in 1860, this group of people came together,
p224
aVand they all speculated about what would happen
p225
aVto the city of New York in 100 years,
p226
aVand the conclusion was unanimous:
p227
aVThe city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
p228
aVWhy? Because they looked at the curve and said,
p229
aVif the population keeps growing at this rate,
p230
aVto move the population of New York around,
p231
aVthey would have needed six million horses,
p232
aVand the manure created by six million horses
p233
aVwould be impossible to deal with.
p234
aVThey were already drowning in manure. (Laughter)
p235
aVSo 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology
p236
aVthat is going to choke the life out of New York.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900,
p239
aVin the United States of America, there were 1,001
p240
aVcar manufacturing companies \u2014 1,001.
p241
aVThe idea of finding a different technology
p242
aVhad absolutely taken over,
p243
aVand there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters.
p244
aVDearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
p245
aa(lp246
VHowever, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
p247
aVFirst, you have to offer them confidentiality.
p248
aVOtherwise they don't come and talk to you.
p249
aVThen you have to offer them absolute, dedicated,
p250
aVpassionate service to them.
p251
aVAnd then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship.
p252
aVThe smallest company, the biggest company,
p253
aVhas to be capable of doing three things beautifully:
p254
aVThe product that you want to sell has to be fantastic,
p255
aVyou have to have fantastic marketing,
p256
aVand you have to have tremendous financial management.
p257
aVGuess what?
p258
aVWe have never met a single human being
p259
aVin the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money.
p260
aVIt doesn't exist.
p261
aVThis person has never been born.
p262
aVWe've done the research, and we have looked
p263
aVat the 100 iconic companies of the world \u2014
p264
aVCarnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford,
p265
aVall the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
p266
aVThere's only one thing that all the successful companies
p267
aVin the world have in common, only one:
p268
aVNone were started by one person.
p269
aVNow we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds
p270
aVin Northumberland, and we start the class
p271
aVby giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography,
p272
aVand the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline,
p273
aVin the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography
p274
aVhow many times Richard uses the word "I"
p275
aVand how many times he uses the word "we."
p276
aVNever the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times.
p277
aVHe wasn't alone when he started.
p278
aVNobody started a company alone. No one.
p279
aVSo we can create the community
p280
aVwhere we have facilitators who come from a small business background
p281
aVsitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies
p282
aVwho will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman
p283
aVwho talks about this epic,
p284
aVsomebody who will say to you, "What do you need?
p285
aVWhat can you do? Can you make it?
p286
aVOkay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?"
p287
aV"Oh, no, I cannot do this.""Would you like me to find you somebody?"
p288
aVWe activate communities.
p289
aVWe have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator
p290
aVto help you to find resources and people
p291
aVand we have discovered that the miracle
p292
aVof the intelligence of local people is such
p293
aVthat you can change the culture and the economy
p294
aVof this community just by capturing the passion,
p295
aVthe energy and imagination of your own people.
p296
aa(lp297
VThank you. (Applause)

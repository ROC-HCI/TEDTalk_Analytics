VI come from Lebanon,
p5
aVand I believe that running can change the world.
p6
aVI know what I have just said is simply not obvious.
p7
aa(lp8
VYou know, Lebanon as a country has been once destroyed
p9
aVby a long and bloody civil war.
p10
aVHonestly, I don't know why they call it civil war
p11
aVwhen there is nothing civil about it.
p12
aVWith Syria to the north, Israel and Palestine to the south,
p13
aVand our government even up till this moment
p14
aVis still fragmented and unstable.
p15
aVFor years, the country has been divided between politics and religion.
p16
aVHowever, for one day a year,
p17
aVwe truly stand united,
p18
aVand that's when the marathon takes place.
p19
aa(lp20
VI used to be a marathon runner.
p21
aVLong distance running was not only good for my well-being
p22
aVbut it helped me meditate and dream big.
p23
aVSo the longer distances I ran,
p24
aVthe bigger my dreams became.
p25
aVUntil one fateful morning,
p26
aVand while training, I was hit by a bus.
p27
aVI nearly died, was in a coma,
p28
aVstayed at the hospital for two years,
p29
aVand underwent 36 surgeries to be able to walk again.
p30
aa(lp31
VAs soon as I came out of my coma,
p32
aVI realized that I was no longer the same runner I used to be,
p33
aVso I decided, if I couldn't run myself,
p34
aVI wanted to make sure that others could.
p35
aVSo out of my hospital bed,
p36
aVI asked my husband to start taking notes,
p37
aVand a few months later, the marathon was born.
p38
aa(lp39
VOrganizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident
p40
aVmay sound strange,
p41
aVbut at that time, even during my most vulnerable condition,
p42
aVI needed to dream big.
p43
aVI needed something to take me out of my pain,
p44
aVan objective to look forward to.
p45
aVI didn't want to pity myself, nor to be pitied,
p46
aVand I thought by organizing such a marathon,
p47
aVI'll be able to pay back to my community,
p48
aVbuild bridges with the outside world,
p49
aVand invite runners to come to Lebanon
p50
aVand run under the umbrella of peace.
p51
aa(lp52
VOrganizing a marathon in Lebanon
p53
aVis definitely not like organizing one in New York.
p54
aVHow do you introduce the concept of running
p55
aVto a nation that is constantly at the brink of war?
p56
aVHow do you ask those who were once fighting
p57
aVand killing each other
p58
aVto come together and run next to each other?
p59
aVMore than that, how do you convince people to run a distance of 26.2 miles
p60
aVat a time they were not even familiar with the word "marathon"?
p61
aVSo we had to start from scratch.
p62
aa(lp63
VFor almost two years, we went all over the country
p64
aVand even visited remote villages.
p65
aVI personally met with people from all walks of life \u2014
p66
aVmayors, NGOs, schoolchildren,
p67
aVpoliticians, militiamen,
p68
aVpeople from mosques, churches,
p69
aVthe president of the country, even housewives.
p70
aVI learned one thing:
p71
aVWhen you walk the talk, people believe you.
p72
aVMany were touched by my personal story,
p73
aVand they shared their stories in return.
p74
aVIt was honesty and transparency that brought us together.
p75
aVWe spoke one common language to each other,
p76
aVand that was from one human to another.
p77
aVOnce that trust was built,
p78
aVeverybody wanted to be part of the marathon
p79
aVto show the world the true colors of Lebanon and the Lebanese
p80
aVand their desire to live in peace and harmony.
p81
aa(lp82
VIn October 2003, over 6,000 runners
p83
aVfrom 49 different nationalities
p84
aVcame to the start line, all determined,
p85
aVand when the gunfire went off,
p86
aVthis time it was a signal to run in harmony,
p87
aVfor a change.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe marathon grew.
p90
aVSo did our political problems.
p91
aVBut for every disaster we had,
p92
aVthe marathon found ways to bring people together.
p93
aVIn 2005, our prime minister was assassinated,
p94
aVand the country came to a complete standstill,
p95
aVso we organized a five-kilometer United We Run campaign.
p96
aVOver 60,000 people came to the start line,
p97
aVall wearing white T-shirts with no political slogans.
p98
aVThat was a turning point for the marathon,
p99
aVwhere people started looking at it as a platform
p100
aVfor peace and unity.
p101
aa(lp102
VBetween 2006 up to 2009, our country, Lebanon,
p103
aVwent through unstable years,
p104
aVinvasions, and more assassinations
p105
aVthat brought us close to a civil war.
p106
aVThe country was divided again,
p107
aVso much that our parliament resigned,
p108
aVwe had no president for a year, and no prime minister.
p109
aVBut we did have a marathon.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Applause)
p112
aa(lp113
VSo through the marathon, we learned that political problems can be overcome.
p114
aVWhen the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center,
p115
aVwe negotiated alternative routes.
p116
aVGovernment protesters became sideline cheerleaders.
p117
aVThey even hosted juice stations.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VYou know, the marathon has really become one of its kind.
p122
aVIt gained credibility
p123
aVfrom both the Lebanese and the international community.
p124
aVLast November 2012, over 33,000 runners from 85 different nationalities
p125
aVcame to the start line,
p126
aVbut this time, they challenged a very stormy and rainy weather.
p127
aVThe streets were flooded, but people didn't want to miss out
p128
aVon the opportunity of being part of such a national day.
p129
aa(lp130
VBMA has expanded.
p131
aVWe include everyone: the young, the elderly,
p132
aVthe disabled, the mentally challenged,
p133
aVthe blind, the elite, the amateur runners,
p134
aVeven moms with their babies.
p135
aVThemes have included runs for the environment,
p136
aVbreast cancer, for the love of Lebanon, for peace,
p137
aVor just simply to run.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe first annual all-women-and-girls race for empowerment,
p140
aVwhich is one of its kind in the region,
p141
aVhas just taken place only a few weeks ago,
p142
aVwith 4,512 women, including the first lady,
p143
aVand this is only the beginning.
p144
aa(lp145
VThank you.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Applause)
p148
aa(lp149
VBMA has supported charities and volunteers
p150
aVwho have helped reshape Lebanon,
p151
aVraising funds for their causes
p152
aVand encouraging others to give.
p153
aVThe culture of giving and doing good has become contagious.
p154
aVStereotypes have been broken.
p155
aVChange-makers and future leaders have been created.
p156
aVI believe these are the building blocks for future peace.
p157
aa(lp158
VBMA has become such a respected event in the region
p159
aVthat government officials in the region,
p160
aVlike Iraq, Egypt and Syria,
p161
aVhave asked the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event.
p162
aVWe are now one of the largest running events in the Middle East,
p163
aVbut most importantly,
p164
aVit is a platform for hope and cooperation
p165
aVin an ever-fragile and unstable part of the world.
p166
aVFrom Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Applause)
p169
aa(lp170
VAfter 10 years in Lebanon,
p171
aVfrom national marathons or from national events
p172
aVto smaller regional races,
p173
aVwe've seen that people want to run for a better future.
p174
aVAfter all, peacemaking is not a sprint.
p175
aVIt is more of a marathon.
p176
aa(lp177
VThank you.

But in 2003, May El-Khalil, a local sports official, decided: It&#39;s time to start a marathon, open to all, as an antidote to sectarianism. And despite ongoing political and security pressure, the Beirut Marathon, now entering its 11th year, has become not only the largest running event in the Middle East but a powerful force for peace.</p><p>El-Khalil was inspired to start the marathon after a personal tragedy: a near-fatal running accident. Doctors told her she would never run again. She was hospitalized for two years and had to undergo a long series of surgeries. But the resolve from this personal struggle created an event that, each year, draws runners and fans from opposing political and religious communities in a symbolic act of peace. Case in point: In 2012, on a rainy and windy November day, more than 33,000 runners turned out. Other countries around the region are now thinking of replicating this model.</p>", "slug": "may_el_khalil", "whotheyare": "The Beirut Marathon is the largest running event in the Middle East.

Beirut, Lebanon, has seen its share of tragedy, as a seat of Lebanon&#39;s long-running civil war (1975-1990) and the Israeli-Lebanese conflict that came to a head in 2006. But in 2003, May El-Khalil, a local sports official, decided: It&#39;s time to start a marathon, open to all, as an antidote to sectarianism. And despite ongoing political and security pressure, the Beirut Marathon, now entering its 11th year, has become not only the largest running event in the Middle East but a powerful force for peace.</p><p>El-Khalil was inspired to start the marathon after a personal tragedy: a near-fatal running accident. Doctors told her she would never run again. She was hospitalized for two years and had to undergo a long series of surgeries. But the resolve from this personal struggle created an event that, each year, draws runners and fans from opposing political and religious communities in a symbolic act of peace. Case in point: In 2012, on a rainy and windy November day, more than 33,000 runners turned out. Other countries around the region are now thinking of replicating this model.</p>", "slug": "may_el_khalil", "whotheyare": "The Beirut Marathon is the largest running event in the Middle East.

VSo I'll be talking about the success of my campus,
p5
aVthe University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,
p6
aVin educating students of all types,
p7
aVacross the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas.
p8
aVWhat makes our story especially important
p9
aVis that we have learned so much from a group of students
p10
aVwho are typically not at the top of the academic ladder \u2014
p11
aVstudents of color, students underrepresented in selected areas.
p12
aVAnd what makes the story especially unique
p13
aVis that we have learned how to help African-American students, Latino students,
p14
aVstudents from low-income backgrounds,
p15
aVto become some of the best in the world in science and engineering.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd so I begin with a story about my childhood.
p18
aVWe all are products of our childhood experiences.
p19
aVIt's hard for me to believe that it's been 50 years
p20
aVsince I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham, Alabama,
p21
aVa kid who loved getting A's,
p22
aVa kid who loved math, who loved to read,
p23
aVa kid who would say to the teacher \u2014
p24
aVwhen the teacher said, "Here are 10 problems," to the class,
p25
aVthis little fat kid would say, "Give us 10 more."
p26
aVAnd the whole class would say, "Shut up, Freeman."
p27
aVAnd there was a designated kicker every day.
p28
aVAnd so I was always asking this question:
p29
aV"Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?"
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd amazingly, one week in church,
p32
aVwhen I really didn't want to be there
p33
aVand I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems,
p34
aVI heard this man say this:
p35
aV"If we can get the children
p36
aVto participate in this peaceful demonstration here in Birmingham,
p37
aVwe can show America that even children know the difference between right and wrong
p38
aVand that children really do want to get the best possible education."
p39
aVAnd I looked up and said, "Who is that man?"
p40
aVAnd they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King.
p41
aVAnd I said to my parents, "I've got to go.
p42
aVI want to go. I want to be a part of this."
p43
aVAnd they said, "Absolutely not."
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd we had a rough go of it.
p48
aVAnd at that time, quite frankly, you really did not talk back to your parents.
p49
aVAnd somehow I said, "You know, you guys are hypocrites.
p50
aVYou make me go to this. You make me listen.
p51
aVThe man wants me to go, and now you say no."
p52
aVAnd they thought about it all night.
p53
aVAnd they came into my room the next morning.
p54
aVThey had not slept.
p55
aVThey had been literally crying and praying and thinking,
p56
aV"Will we let our 12-year-old
p57
aVparticipate in this march and probably have to go to jail?"
p58
aVAnd they decided to do it.
p59
aVAnd when they came in to tell me,
p60
aVI was at first elated.
p61
aVAnd then all of a sudden I began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses,
p62
aVand I got really scared, I really did.
p63
aVAnd one of the points I make to people all the time
p64
aVis that sometimes when people do things that are courageous,
p65
aVit doesn't really mean that they're that courageous.
p66
aVIt simply means that they believe it's important to do it.
p67
aa(lp68
VI wanted a better education.
p69
aVI did not want to have to have hand-me-down books.
p70
aVI wanted to know that the school I attended
p71
aVnot only had good teachers, but the resources we needed.
p72
aVAnd as a result of that experience,
p73
aVin the middle of the week, while I was there in jail,
p74
aVDr. King came and said with our parents,
p75
aV"What you children do this day
p76
aVwill have an impact on children who have not been born."
p77
aa(lp78
VI recently realized that two-thirds of Americans today
p79
aVhad not been born at the time of 1963.
p80
aVAnd so for them, when they hear about the Children's Crusade in Birmingham,
p81
aVin many ways, if they see it on TV,
p82
aVit's like our looking at the 1863 "Lincoln" movie:
p83
aVIt's history.
p84
aVAnd the real question is, what lessons did we learn?
p85
aVWell amazingly, the most important for me was this:
p86
aVThat children can be empowered to take ownership of their education.
p87
aVThey can be taught to be passionate
p88
aVabout wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking questions.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd so it is especially significant
p91
aVthat the university I now lead,
p92
aVthe University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,
p93
aVwas founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King, in 1963.
p94
aVAnd what made that institutional founding especially important
p95
aVis that Maryland is the South, as you know,
p96
aVand, quite frankly, it was the first university in our state
p97
aVfounded at a time when students of all races could go there.
p98
aVAnd so we had black and white students and others who began to attend.
p99
aVAnd it has been for 50 years an experiment.
p100
aVThe experiment is this:
p101
aVIs it possible to have institutions in our country, universities,
p102
aVwhere people from all backgrounds can come and learn
p103
aVand learn to work together and learn to become leaders
p104
aVand to support each other in that experience?
p105
aa(lp106
VNow what is especially important about that experience for me is this:
p107
aVWe found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences.
p108
aVAnd so we began to work on that, for years in the '60s.
p109
aVAnd we produced a number of people in law, all the way to the humanities.
p110
aVWe produced great artists. Beckett is our muse.
p111
aVA lot of our students get into theater.
p112
aVIt's great work.
p113
aVThe problem that we faced was the same problem America continues to face \u2014
p114
aVthat students in the sciences and engineering,
p115
aVblack students were not succeeding.
p116
aVBut when I looked at the data,
p117
aVwhat I found was that, quite frankly, students in general,
p118
aVlarge numbers were not making it.
p119
aVAnd as a result of that,
p120
aVwe decided to do something that would help, first of all,
p121
aVthe group at the bottom, African-American students, and then Hispanic students.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd Robert and Jane Meyerhoff, philanthropists, said, "We'd like to help."
p124
aVRobert Meyerhoff said, "Why is it that everything I see on TV about black boys,
p125
aVif it's not about basketball, is not positive?
p126
aVI'd like to make a difference, to do something that's positive."
p127
aVWe married those ideas, and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program.
p128
aVAnd what is significant about the program
p129
aVis that we learned a number of things.
p130
aVAnd the question is this:
p131
aVHow is it that now we lead the country in producing African-Americans
p132
aVwho go on to complete Ph.D.'s in science and engineering and M.D./Ph.D.'s?
p133
aVThat's a big deal. Give me a hand for that. That's a big deal.
p134
aVThat's a big deal. It really is.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Applause)
p137
aa(lp138
VYou see, most people don't realize
p139
aVthat it's not just minorities who don't do well in science and engineering.
p140
aVQuite frankly, you're talking about Americans.
p141
aVIf you don't know it, while 20 percent of blacks and Hispanics
p142
aVwho begin with a major in science and engineering
p143
aVwill actually graduate in science and engineering,
p144
aVonly 32 percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas
p145
aVactually succeed and graduate in those areas,
p146
aVand only 42 percent of Asian-Americans.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd so, the real question is, what is the challenge?
p149
aVWell a part of it, of course, is K-12.
p150
aVWe need to strengthen K-12.
p151
aVBut the other part has to do with the culture
p152
aVof science and engineering on our campuses.
p153
aVWhether you know it or not, large numbers of students with high SAT's
p154
aVand large numbers of A.P. credits
p155
aVwho go to the most prestigious universities in our country
p156
aVbegin in pre-med or pre-engineering and engineering, and they end up changing their majors.
p157
aVAnd the number one reason, we find, quite frankly,
p158
aVis they did not do well in first year science courses.
p159
aVIn fact, we call first year science and engineering, typically around America,
p160
aVweed-out courses or barrier courses.
p161
aa(lp162
VHow many of you in this audience know somebody
p163
aVwho started off in pre-med or engineering
p164
aVand changed their major within a year or two?
p165
aVIt's an American challenge. Half of you in the room.
p166
aVI know. I know. I know.
p167
aVAnd what is interesting about that
p168
aVis that so many students are smart and can do it.
p169
aVWe need to find ways of making it happen.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo what are the four things we did to help minority students
p172
aVthat now are helping students in general?
p173
aVNumber one: high expectations.
p174
aVIt takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students \u2014
p175
aVtheir grades, the rigor of the course work,
p176
aVtheir test-taking skills, their attitude,
p177
aVthe fire in their belly, the passion for the work, to make it.
p178
aVAnd so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position, very important.
p179
aVBut equally important, it takes an understanding that it's hard work that makes the difference.
p180
aVI don't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are.
p181
aVSmart simply means you're ready to learn.
p182
aVYou're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions.
p183
aa(lp184
VI. I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate, said that when he was growing up in New York,
p185
aVall of his friends' parents would ask them
p186
aV"What did you learn in school?" at the end of a day.
p187
aVAnd he said, in contrast, his Jewish mother would say,
p188
aV"Izzy, did you ask a good question today?"
p189
aVAnd so high expectations have to do with curiosity
p190
aVand encouraging young people to be curious.
p191
aVAnd as a result of those high expectations,
p192
aVwe began to find students we wanted to work with
p193
aVto see what could we do to help them,
p194
aVnot simply to survive in science and engineering,
p195
aVbut to become the very best, to excel.
p196
aa(lp197
VInterestingly enough, an example:
p198
aVOne young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school,
p199
aVwe said, "We need to have you retake the course,
p200
aVbecause you need a strong foundation if you're going to move to the next level."
p201
aVEvery foundation makes the difference in the next level.
p202
aVHe retook the course.
p203
aVThat young man went on to graduate from UMBC,
p204
aVto become the first black to get the M.D./Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.
p205
aVHe now works at Harvard.
p206
aVNice story. Give him a hand for that too.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VSecondly, it's not about test scores only.
p211
aVTest scores are important, but they're not the most important thing.
p212
aVOne young woman had great grades, but test scores were not as high.
p213
aVBut she had a factor that was very important.
p214
aVShe never missed a day of school, K-12.
p215
aVThere was fire in that belly.
p216
aVThat young woman went on, and she is today with an M.D./Ph.D. from Hopkins.
p217
aVShe's on the faculty, tenure track in psychiatry, Ph.D. in neuroscience.
p218
aVShe and her adviser have a patent on a second use of Viagra for diabetes patients.
p219
aVBig hand for her. Big hand for her.
p220
aV(Applause)
p221
aVAnd so high expectations, very important.
p222
aa(lp223
VSecondly, the idea of building community among the students.
p224
aVYou all know that so often in science and engineering
p225
aVwe tend to think cutthroat.
p226
aVStudents are not taught to work in groups.
p227
aVAnd that's what we work to do with that group
p228
aVto get them to understand each other,
p229
aVto build trust among them, to support each other,
p230
aVto learn how to ask good questions,
p231
aVbut also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity.
p232
aVAs you know, it's one thing to earn an A yourself,
p233
aVit's another thing to help someone else do well.
p234
aVAnd so to feel that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world.
p235
aVSo building community among those students, very important.
p236
aa(lp237
VThird, the idea of, it takes researchers to produce researchers.
p238
aVWhether you're talking about artists producing artists
p239
aVor you're talking about people getting into the social sciences,
p240
aVwhatever the discipline \u2014 and especially in science and engineering, as in art, for example \u2014
p241
aVyou need scientists to pull the students into the work.
p242
aVAnd so our students are working in labs regularly.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd one great example that you'll appreciate:
p245
aVDuring a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago,
p246
aVthe guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant
p247
aVliterally came back to work in his lab after several days,
p248
aVand all these students had refused to leave the lab.
p249
aVThey had food they had packed out.
p250
aVThey were in the lab working,
p251
aVand they saw the work, not as schoolwork, but as their lives.
p252
aVThey knew they were working on AIDS research.
p253
aVThey were looking at this amazing protein design.
p254
aVAnd what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work.
p255
aVAnd he said, "It doesn't get any better than that."
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd then finally, if you've got the community
p258
aVand you've got the high expectations and you've got researchers producing researchers,
p259
aVyou have to have people who are willing as faculty
p260
aVto get involved with those students, even in the classroom.
p261
aVI'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying,
p262
aV"I've got this young man in class, a young black guy,
p263
aVand he seems like he's just not excited about the work.
p264
aVHe's not taking notes. We need to talk to him."
p265
aVWhat was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student
p266
aVto understand who was really involved and who was not
p267
aVand was saying, "Let me see how I can work with them.
p268
aVLet me get the staff to help me out."
p269
aVIt was that connecting.
p270
aVThat young man today is actually a faculty member M.D./Ph.D. in neuroengineering at Duke.
p271
aVGive him a big hand for that.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Applause)
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd so the significance is that we have now developed this model
p276
aVthat is helping us, not only finally with evaluation, assessing what works.
p277
aVAnd what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses.
p278
aVAnd so we redesigned chemistry, we redesigned physics.
p279
aVBut now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences.
p280
aVBecause so many students are bored in class.
p281
aVDo you know that?
p282
aVMany students, K-12 and in universities,
p283
aVdon't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk.
p284
aVThey need to be engaged.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd so we have done \u2014 if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center,
p287
aVyou'll see people coming from all over the country
p288
aVto look at how we are redesigning courses,
p289
aVhaving an emphasis on collaboration, use of technology,
p290
aVusing problems out of our biotech companies on our campus,
p291
aVand not giving students the theories,
p292
aVbut having them struggle with those theories.
p293
aVAnd it's working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland,
p294
aVmore and more courses are being redesigned.
p295
aa(lp296
VIt's called academic innovation.
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd what does all of that mean?
p299
aVIt means that now, not just in science and engineering,
p300
aVwe now have programs in the arts, in the humanities, in the social sciences,
p301
aVin teacher education, even particularly for women in I.T.
p302
aVIf you don't know it, there's been a 79-percent decline
p303
aVin the number of women majoring in computer science just since 2000.
p304
aVAnd what I'm saying is that what will make the difference
p305
aVwill be building community among students,
p306
aVtelling young women, young minority students and students in general,
p307
aVyou can do this work.
p308
aVAnd most important, giving them a chance to build that community
p309
aVwith faculty pulling them into the work
p310
aVand our assessing what works and what does not work.
p311
aVMost important, if a student has a sense of self,
p312
aVit is amazing how the dreams and the values
p313
aVcan make all the difference in the world.
p314
aa(lp315
VWhen I was a 12-year-old child in the jail in Birmingham,
p316
aVI kept thinking, "I wonder what my future could be."
p317
aVI had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham
p318
aVto one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries,
p319
aVwhere students are not there just to survive,
p320
aVwhere they love learning, where they enjoy being the best,
p321
aVwhere they will one day change the world.
p322
aa(lp323
VAristotle said, "Excellence is never an accident.
p324
aVIt is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution.
p325
aVIt represents the wisest option among many alternatives."
p326
aVAnd then he said something that gives me goosebumps.
p327
aVHe said, "Choice, not chance, determines your destiny."
p328
aVChoice, not chance, determines your destiny, dreams and values.
p329
aa(lp330
VThank you all very much.
p331

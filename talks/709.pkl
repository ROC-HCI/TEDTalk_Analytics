VGood morning.
p5
aVI've come here to share with you an experiment
p6
aVof how to get rid of one form of human suffering.
p7
aVIt really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy.
p8
aVHis mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.
p9
aVI think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Music)
p12
aa(lp13
VWoman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no,
p14
aVwhat use do we have for a blind woman?
p15
aVI couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.
p16
aVIf an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.
p17
aa(lp18
VThulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it,
p19
aVbut I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity,
p20
aVtheir independence, and their status in the family.
p21
aVSo she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.
p22
aVAnd the irony is that they don't need to be.
p23
aa(lp24
VA simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions,
p25
aVand something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.
p26
aVIf we add to that the many of us here now
p27
aVwho are more productive because they have a pair of glasses,
p28
aVthen almost one in five Indians will require eye care,
p29
aVa staggering 200 million people.
p30
aVToday, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo this is the context in which Aravind came into existence
p33
aVabout 30 years back
p34
aVas a post-retirement project of Dr. V.
p35
aVHe started this with no money.
p36
aVHe had to mortgage all his life savings
p37
aVto make a bank loan.
p38
aVAnd over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals,
p39
aVpredominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,
p40
aVand then we added several, what we call Vision Centers
p41
aVas a hub-and-spoke model.
p42
aVAnd then more recently we started managing hospitals
p43
aVin other parts of the country
p44
aVand also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe last three decades,
p47
aVwe have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries,
p48
aVa vast majority of them for the poor people.
p49
aVNow, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.
p50
aVA typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries,
p51
aVmaybe see about 6,000 patients,
p52
aVsend out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients,
p53
aVlots of telemedicine consultations,
p54
aVand, on top of that, do a lot of training,
p55
aVboth for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well,
p58
aVrequires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.
p59
aVAnd I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks
p60
aVput in place by Dr. V.,
p61
aVa value system, an efficient delivery process,
p62
aVand fostering the culture of innovation.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Music)
p65
aa(lp66
VDr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village,
p67
aVand suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being,
p68
aVyou seem to be one with him.
p69
aVHere is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.
p70
aVDoctor, whatever you say, I accept it.
p71
aVAn implicit faith in you
p72
aVand then you respond to it.
p73
aVHere is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.
p74
aVWhen we grow in spiritual consciousness,
p75
aVwe identify ourselves with all that is in the world,
p76
aVso there is no exploitation.
p77
aVIt is ourselves we are helping.
p78
aVIt is ourselves we are healing.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Applause)
p81
aa(lp82
VThis helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization
p83
aVand systems that support it.
p84
aVBut on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,
p85
aVand, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.
p86
aa(lp87
VDr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.
p88
aVThey feel they can train people all over the world,
p89
aVirrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,
p90
aVto produce a product in the same way
p91
aVand deliver it in the same manner
p92
aVin hundreds of places.
p93
aa(lp94
VLarry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,
p95
aVand none of it made any sense to us.
p96
aVHe wanted to create a franchise,
p97
aVa mechanism of delivery of eye care
p98
aVwith the efficiency of McDonald's.
p99
aa(lp100
VDr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,
p101
aVtechniques, methods, all in the same way,
p102
aVand make it available in every corner of the world.
p103
aVThe problem of blindness is gone.
p104
aa(lp105
VTR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,
p106
aVas American or African,
p107
aVthe problem is the same, the treatment is the same.
p108
aVAnd yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,
p109
aVand that was the fundamental principle that we followed
p110
aVwhen we designed the delivery systems.
p111
aVAnd, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,
p112
aVwe are talking of millions of people,
p113
aVvery little resource to deal with it,
p114
aVand then lots of logistics and affordability issues.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd then so, one had to constantly innovate.
p117
aVAnd one of the early innovations, which still continues,
p118
aVis to create ownership in the community to the problem,
p119
aVand then engage with them as a partner,
p120
aVand here is one such event.
p121
aVHere a community camp just organized
p122
aVby the community themselves,
p123
aVwhere they find a place, organize volunteers,
p124
aVand then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,
p125
aVand then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is
p126
aVand then determine what further testing should be done,
p127
aVand then those tests are done by technicians
p128
aVwho check for glasses,
p129
aVor check for glaucoma.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,
p132
aVand then prescribes a line of treatment,
p133
aVand if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,
p134
aVusually under a tree.
p135
aVBut they get glasses in the frames of their choice,
p136
aVand that's very important because I think glasses,
p137
aVin addition to helping people see,
p138
aVis also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.
p139
aVSo they get it in about 20 minutes
p140
aVand those who require surgery, are counseled,
p141
aVand then there are buses waiting,
p142
aVwhich will transport them to the base hospital.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,
p145
aVmany people like this would probably never get services,
p146
aVand certainly not when they most need it.
p147
aVThey receive surgery the following day,
p148
aVand then they will stay for a day or two,
p149
aVand then they are put back on the buses
p150
aVto be taken back to where they came from,
p151
aVand where their families will be waiting to take them back home.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Applause)
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd this happens several thousand times each year.
p156
aVIt may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,
p157
aVvery efficient process,
p158
aVbut we looked at, are we solving the problem?
p159
aVWe did a study, a scientifically designed process,
p160
aVand then, to our dismay,
p161
aVwe found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,
p162
aVand we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo we had to do something different,
p165
aVso we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.
p166
aVThese are truly paperless offices
p167
aVwith completely electronic medical records and so on.
p168
aVThey receive comprehensive eye exams.
p169
aVWe kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,
p170
aVand then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe effect of this has been that, within the first year,
p173
aVwe really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,
p174
aVwhich is over 50,000 people.
p175
aVAnd the second year went up to 75 percent.
p176
aVSo I think we have a process by which
p177
aVwe can really penetrate into the market
p178
aVand reach everyone who needs it,
p179
aVand in this process of using technology, make sure
p180
aVthat most don't need to come to the base hospital.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd how much will they pay for this?
p183
aVWe fixed the pricing, taking into account
p184
aVwhat they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,
p185
aVso they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Applause)
p188
aa(lp189
VThe other challenge was, how do you give high-tech
p190
aVor more advanced treatment and care?
p191
aVWe designed a van with a VSAT,
p192
aVwhich sends out images of patients to the base hospital
p193
aVwhere it is diagnosed,
p194
aVand then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,
p195
aVit gets printed out, the patient gets it,
p196
aVand then gets a consultation about what they should be doing \u2014
p197
aVI mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,
p198
aVand then this happens as a way of
p199
aVbridging the technology competence.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,
p202
aVbecause it focused on the non-customer,
p203
aVand then by reaching the unreached,
p204
aVwe're able to significantly grow the market.
p205
aa(lp206
VThe other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently
p207
aVwhen you have very few ophthalmologists?
p208
aVSo what is in this video is a surgeon operating,
p209
aVand then you see on the other side,
p210
aVanother patient is getting ready.
p211
aVSo, as they finish the surgery,
p212
aVthey just swing the microscope over,
p213
aVthe tables are placed so that their distance is just right,
p214
aVand then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,
p215
aVwe're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd then to support the surgeon,
p218
aVwe require a certain workforce.
p219
aVAnd then we focused on village girls that we recruited,
p220
aVand then they really are the backbone of the organization.
p221
aVThey do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.
p222
aVThey do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.
p223
aVWith the result we have very high productivity,
p224
aVvery high quality at very, very low cost.
p225
aVSo, putting all this together, what really happened was
p226
aVthe productivity of our staff was
p227
aVsignificantly higher than anyone else.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VThis is a very busy table,
p232
aVbut what this really is conveying is that,
p233
aVwhen it comes to quality, we have put in
p234
aVvery good quality-assurance systems.
p235
aVAs a result, our complications are significantly lower
p236
aVthan what has been reported in the United Kingdom,
p237
aVand you don't see those kind of numbers very often.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VSo the final part of the puzzle is,
p242
aVhow do you make all this work financially,
p243
aVespecially when the people can't pay for it?
p244
aVSo what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,
p245
aVand then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,
p246
aVnothing more, and often much less.
p247
aVAnd we were helped by the market inefficiency.
p248
aVI think that has been a big savior, even now.
p249
aVAnd, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away
p250
aVwhat you have as a surplus.
p251
aa(lp252
VThe result has been, over the years,
p253
aVthe expenditure has increased with volumes.
p254
aVThe revenues increase at a higher level,
p255
aVgiving us a healthy margin
p256
aVwhile you're treating a large number of people for free.
p257
aVI think in absolute terms,
p258
aVlast year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,
p259
aVspent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Applause)
p262
aa(lp263
VBut this really requires going beyond what we do,
p264
aVor what we have done,
p265
aVif you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.
p266
aVAnd what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.
p267
aVWe created competition for ourselves,
p268
aVand then we made eye care affordable
p269
aVby making low-cost consumables.
p270
aVWe proactively and systematically
p271
aVpromoted these practices to many hospitals in India,
p272
aVmany in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.
p273
aVThe impact of this has been that these hospitals,
p274
aVin the second year after our consultation,
p275
aVare double their output
p276
aVand then achieve financial recovery as well.
p277
aa(lp278
VThe other part was how do you address
p279
aVthis increase in cost of technology?
p280
aVThere was a time when we failed to negotiate
p281
aVthe [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,
p282
aVso we set up a manufacturing unit.
p283
aVAnd then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly
p284
aVto about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.
p285
aVToday, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,
p286
aVand they're used in about 120-odd countries.
p287
aa(lp288
VTo conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,
p289
aVor is it just India or developing countries?
p290
aVSo to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.
p291
aVWhat it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent
p292
aVof the volume of what the UK does,
p293
aVnear a half-million surgeries as a whole country.
p294
aVAnd we do about 300,000.
p295
aVAnd then we train about 50 ophthalmologists
p296
aVagainst the 70 trained by them,
p297
aVcomparable quality, both in training and in patient care.
p298
aVSo we're really comparing apples to apples.
p299
aVWe looked at cost.
p300
aV(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VSo, I think it is simple to say
p305
aVjust because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.
p306
aVI think there is more to it.
p307
aVI mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.
p308
aVMaybe there is \u2014
p309
aVthe solution to the cost could be in productivity,
p310
aVmaybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,
p311
aVor in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,
p312
aVor regulations, their defensive practice.
p313
aVSo, I think decoding this can probably bring
p314
aVanswers to most developed countries
p315
aVincluding the U.S., and maybe
p316
aVObama's ratings can go up again.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VAnother insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,
p321
aVin conditions where the problem is very large,
p322
aVwhich cuts across all economic strata,
p323
aVwhere we have a good solution,
p324
aVI think the process I described,
p325
aVyou know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,
p326
aVcan give an answer,
p327
aVand there are many which fit this paradigm.
p328
aVYou take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.
p329
aVThere are many where this paradigm can now play,
p330
aVbut I think probably one of the most challenging things
p331
aVis on the softer side.
p332
aa(lp333
VNow, how do you create compassion?
p334
aVNow, how do you make people own the problem,
p335
aVwant to do something about it?
p336
aVThere are a bit harder issues.
p337
aVAnd I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.
p340
aa(lp341
VDr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness,
p342
aVwe identify with all that is in the world
p343
aVso there is no exploitation.
p344
aVIt is ourselves we are helping.
p345
aVIt is ourselves we are healing.
p346
aa(lp347
VTR: Thank you very much.

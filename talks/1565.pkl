VThe job of uncovering the global food waste scandal
p5
aVstarted for me when I was 15 years old.
p6
aVI bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex.
p7
aVAnd I started to feed them in the most traditional
p8
aVand environmentally friendly way.
p9
aVI went to my school kitchen, and I said,
p10
aV"Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned
p11
aVtheir noses up at."
p12
aVI went to the local baker and took their stale bread.
p13
aVI went to the local greengrocer, and I went to a farmer
p14
aVwho was throwing away potatoes because they were
p15
aVthe wrong shape or size for supermarkets.
p16
aVThis was great. My pigs turned that food waste
p17
aVinto delicious pork. I sold that pork
p18
aVto my school friends' parents, and I made
p19
aVa good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs
p22
aVwas in fact fit for human consumption,
p23
aVand that I was only scratching the surface,
p24
aVand that right the way up the food supply chain,
p25
aVin supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, in our homes,
p26
aVin factories and farms, we were hemorrhaging out food.
p27
aVSupermarkets didn't even want to talk to me
p28
aVabout how much food they were wasting.
p29
aVI'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food
p30
aVbeing locked and then trucked off to landfill sites,
p31
aVand I thought, surely there is something more sensible
p32
aVto do with food than waste it.
p33
aa(lp34
VOne morning, when I was feeding my pigs,
p35
aVI noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf
p36
aVthat used to crop up from time to time.
p37
aVI grabbed hold of it,
p38
aVsat down, and ate my breakfast with my pigs. (Laughter)
p39
aVThat was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism,
p40
aVreally an exhibition of the injustice of food waste,
p41
aVand the provision of the solution to food waste,
p42
aVwhich is simply to sit down and eat food,
p43
aVrather than throwing it away.
p44
aVThat became, as it were, a way of confronting
p45
aVlarge businesses in the business of wasting food,
p46
aVand exposing, most importantly, to the public,
p47
aVthat when we're talking about food being thrown away,
p48
aVwe're not talking about rotten stuff, we're not talking about
p49
aVstuff that's beyond the pale.
p50
aVWe're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted
p51
aVon a colossal scale.
p52
aa(lp53
VEventually, I set about writing my book,
p54
aVreally to demonstrate the extent of this problem
p55
aVon a global scale. What this shows is
p56
aVa nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level
p57
aVof food waste in each country in the world.
p58
aVUnfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist,
p59
aVand therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find
p60
aVsome proxy way of uncovering
p61
aVhow much food was being wasted.
p62
aVSo I took the food supply of every single country
p63
aVand I compared it to what was actually likely
p64
aVto be being consumed in each country.
p65
aVThat's based on diet intake surveys, it's based on
p66
aVlevels of obesity, it's based on a range of factors
p67
aVthat gives you an approximate guess
p68
aVas to how much food is actually going into people's mouths.
p69
aVThat black line in the middle of that table
p70
aVis the likely level of consumption
p71
aVwith an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste.
p72
aVThere will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic
p73
aVthat I think we can live in a waste-free world.
p74
aVBut that black line shows what a food supply should be
p75
aVin a country if they allow for a good, stable, secure,
p76
aVnutritional diet for every person in that country.
p77
aVAny dot above that line, and you'll quickly notice that
p78
aVthat includes most countries in the world,
p79
aVrepresents unnecessary surplus, and is likely to reflect
p80
aVlevels of waste in each country.
p81
aa(lp82
VAs a country gets richer, it invests more and more
p83
aVin getting more and more surplus
p84
aVinto its shops and restaurants,
p85
aVand as you can see, most European
p86
aVand North American countries
p87
aVfall between 150 and 200 percent
p88
aVof the nutritional requirements of their populations.
p89
aVSo a country like America has twice as much food
p90
aVon its shop shelves and in its restaurants
p91
aVthan is actually required to feed the American people.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut the thing that really struck me,
p94
aVwhen I plotted all this data, and it was a lot of numbers,
p95
aVwas that you can see how it levels off.
p96
aVCountries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark,
p97
aVand then they level off, and they don't really go on rising
p98
aVas you might expect.
p99
aVSo I decided to unpack that data a little bit further
p100
aVto see if that was true or false.
p101
aVAnd that's what I came up with.
p102
aVIf you include not just the food that ends up
p103
aVin shops and restaurants, but also the food
p104
aVthat people feed to livestock,
p105
aVthe maize, the soy, the wheat, that humans could eat
p106
aVbut choose to fatten livestock instead to produce
p107
aVincreasing amounts of meat and dairy products,
p108
aVwhat you find is that most rich countries
p109
aVhave between three and four times the amount of food
p110
aVthat their population needs to feed itself.
p111
aVA country like America has four times the amount of food
p112
aVthat it needs.
p113
aa(lp114
VWhen people talk about the need to increase global
p115
aVfood production to feed those nine billion people
p116
aVthat are expected on the planet by 2050,
p117
aVI always think of these graphs.
p118
aVThe fact is, we have an enormous buffer
p119
aVin rich countries between ourselves and hunger.
p120
aVWe've never had such gargantuan surpluses before.
p121
aVIn many ways, this is a great success story
p122
aVof human civilization, of the agricultural surpluses
p123
aVthat we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago.
p124
aVIt is a success story. It has been a success story.
p125
aVBut what we have to recognize now is that we are
p126
aVreaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear,
p127
aVand when we chop down forests, as we are every day,
p128
aVto grow more and more food,
p129
aVwhen we extract water from depleting water reserves,
p130
aVwhen we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest
p131
aVto grow more and more food,
p132
aVand then we throw away so much of it,
p133
aVwe have to think about what we can start saving.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd yesterday, I went to one of the local supermarkets
p136
aVthat I often visit to
p137
aVinspect, if you like, what they're throwing away.
p138
aVI found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst
p139
aVall the fruit and vegetables and everything else
p140
aVthat was in there.
p141
aVAnd I thought, well this could serve as a symbol for today.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits
p144
aVthat I found in the bin represent the global food supply,
p145
aVokay? We start out with nine.
p146
aVThat's what's in fields around the world every single year.
p147
aVThe first biscuit we're going to lose
p148
aVbefore we even leave the farm.
p149
aVThat's a problem primarily associated with
p150
aVdeveloping work agriculture, whether it's
p151
aVa lack of infrastructure, refrigeration, pasteurization,
p152
aVgrain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means
p153
aVthat food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields.
p154
aVThe next three biscuits are the foods that we decide
p155
aVto feed to livestock, the maize, the wheat and the soya.
p156
aVUnfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals,
p157
aVand they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat,
p158
aVso we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one
p159
aVin meat and dairy products.
p160
aVTwo more we're going to throw away directly into bins.
p161
aVThis is what most of us think of when we think
p162
aVof food waste, what ends up in the garbage,
p163
aVwhat ends up in supermarket bins,
p164
aVwhat ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two,
p165
aVand we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on.
p166
aVThat is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources,
p167
aVespecially when you think of the billion hungry people
p168
aVthat exist already in the world.
p169
aa(lp170
VHaving gone through the data, I then needed
p171
aVto demonstrate where that food ends up.
p172
aVWhere does it end up? We're used to seeing the stuff
p173
aVon our plates, but what about all the stuff
p174
aVthat goes missing in between?
p175
aa(lp176
VSupermarkets are an easy place to start.
p177
aVThis is the result of my hobby,
p178
aVwhich is unofficial bin inspections. (Laughter)
p179
aVStrange you might think, but if we could rely on corporations
p180
aVto tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores,
p181
aVwe wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back,
p182
aVopening up bins and having a look at what's inside.
p183
aVBut this is what you can see more or less on
p184
aVevery street corner in Britain, in Europe, in North America.
p185
aVIt represents a colossal waste of food,
p186
aVbut what I discovered whilst I was writing my book
p187
aVwas that this very evident abundance of waste
p188
aVwas actually the tip of the iceberg.
p189
aVWhen you start going up the supply chain,
p190
aVyou find where the real food waste is happening
p191
aVon a gargantuan scale.
p192
aa(lp193
VCan I have a show of hands
p194
aVif you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house?
p195
aVWho lives in a household where that crust \u2014
p196
aVthat slice at the first and last end of each loaf \u2014
p197
aVwho lives in a household where it does get eaten?
p198
aVOkay, most people, not everyone, but most people,
p199
aVand this is, I'm glad to say, what I see across the world,
p200
aVand yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop
p201
aVanywhere in the world that serves sandwiches
p202
aVwith crusts on it? (Laughter)
p203
aVI certainly haven't.
p204
aVSo I kept on thinking, where do those crusts go? (Laughter)
p205
aVThis is the answer, unfortunately:
p206
aV13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of
p207
aVthis one single factory every single day, day-fresh bread.
p208
aVIn the same year that I visited this factory,
p209
aVI went to Pakistan, where people in 2008 were going hungry
p210
aVas a result of a squeeze on global food supplies.
p211
aVWe contribute to that squeeze
p212
aVby depositing food in bins here in Britain
p213
aVand elsewhere in the world. We take food
p214
aVoff the market shelves that hungry people depend on.
p215
aa(lp216
VGo one step up, and you get to farmers,
p217
aVwho throw away sometimes a third or even more
p218
aVof their harvest because of cosmetic standards.
p219
aVThis farmer, for example, has invested 16,000 pounds
p220
aVin growing spinach, not one leaf of which he harvested,
p221
aVbecause there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it.
p222
aVPotatoes that are cosmetically imperfect,
p223
aVall going for pigs.
p224
aVParsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications,
p225
aVtomatoes in Tenerife,
p226
aVoranges in Florida,
p227
aVbananas in Ecuador, where I visited last year,
p228
aVall being discarded. This is one day's waste
p229
aVfrom one banana plantation in Ecuador.
p230
aVAll being discarded, perfectly edible,
p231
aVbecause they're the wrong shape or size.
p232
aa(lp233
VIf we do that to fruit and vegetables,
p234
aVyou bet we can do it to animals too.
p235
aVLiver, lungs, heads, tails,
p236
aVkidneys, testicles,
p237
aVall of these things which are traditional,
p238
aVdelicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy
p239
aVgo to waste. Offal consumption has halved
p240
aVin Britain and America in the last 30 years.
p241
aVAs a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best,
p242
aVor is incinerated.
p243
aVThis man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China,
p244
aVis serving up his national dish.
p245
aVIt's called sheep's organs.
p246
aVIt's delicious, it's nutritious,
p247
aVand as I learned when I went to Kashgar,
p248
aVit symbolizes their taboo against food waste.
p249
aVI was sitting in a roadside cafe.
p250
aVA chef came to talk to me, I finished my bowl,
p251
aVand halfway through the conversation, he stopped talking
p252
aVand he started frowning into my bowl.
p253
aVI thought, "My goodness, what taboo have I broken?
p254
aVHow have I insulted my host?"
p255
aVHe pointed at three grains of rice
p256
aVat the bottom of my bowl, and he said, "Clean." (Laughter)
p257
aVI thought, "My God, you know, I go around the world
p258
aVtelling people to stop wasting food.
p259
aVThis guy has thrashed me at my own game." (Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VBut it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we, the people,
p262
aVdo have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources
p263
aVif we regard it as socially unacceptable
p264
aVto waste food on a colossal scale,
p265
aVif we make noise about it, tell corporations about it,
p266
aVtell governments we want to see an end to food waste,
p267
aVwe do have the power to bring about that change.
p268
aa(lp269
VFish, 40 to 60 percent of European fish
p270
aVare discarded at sea, they don't even get landed.
p271
aVIn our homes, we've lost touch with food.
p272
aVThis is an experiment I did on three lettuces.
p273
aVWho keeps lettuces in their fridge?
p274
aVMost people. The one on the left
p275
aVwas kept in a fridge for 10 days.
p276
aVThe one in the middle, on my kitchen table. Not much difference.
p277
aVThe one on the right I treated like cut flowers.
p278
aVIt's a living organism, cut the slice off,
p279
aVstuck it in a vase of water,
p280
aVit was all right for another two weeks after this.
p281
aa(lp282
VSome food waste, as I said at the beginning,
p283
aVwill inevitably arise, so the question is,
p284
aVwhat is the best thing to do with it?
p285
aVI answered that question when I was 15.
p286
aVIn fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago:
p287
aVWe domesticated pigs
p288
aVto turn food waste back into food.
p289
aVAnd yet, in Europe, that practice has become illegal
p290
aVsince 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak.
p291
aVIt's unscientific. It's unnecessary.
p292
aVIf you cook food for pigs, just as if
p293
aVyou cook food for humans, it is rendered safe.
p294
aVIt's also a massive saving of resources.
p295
aVAt the moment, Europe depends on importing
p296
aVmillions of tons of soy from South America,
p297
aVwhere its production contributes to global warming,
p298
aVto deforestation, to biodiversity loss,
p299
aVto feed livestock here in Europe.
p300
aVAt the same time we throw away millions of tons
p301
aVof food waste which we could and should be feeding them.
p302
aVIf we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save
p303
aVthat amount of carbon.
p304
aVIf we feed our food waste which is the current
p305
aVgovernment favorite way of getting rid of food waste,
p306
aVto anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste
p307
aVinto gas to produce electricity,
p308
aVyou save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide
p309
aVper ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs.
p310
aVWe knew that during the war. (Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VA silver lining: It has kicked off globally,
p313
aVthe quest to tackle food waste.
p314
aVFeeding the 5,000 is an event I first organized in 2009.
p315
aVWe fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise
p316
aVwould have been wasted.
p317
aVSince then, it's happened again in London,
p318
aVit's happening internationally, and across the country.
p319
aVIt's a way of organizations coming together
p320
aVto celebrate food, to say the best thing to do with food
p321
aVis to eat and enjoy it, and to stop wasting it.
p322
aVFor the sake of the planet we live on,
p323
aVfor the sake of our children,
p324
aVfor the sake of all the other
p325
aVorganisms that share our planet with us,
p326
aVwe are a terrestrial animal, and we depend on our land
p327
aVfor food. At the moment, we are trashing our land
p328
aVto grow food that no one eats.
p329
aVStop wasting food. Thank you very much. (Applause)
p330
aV(Applause)

VFor over a decade as a doctor,
p5
aVI've cared for homeless veterans,
p6
aVfor working-class families.
p7
aVI've cared for people who  live and work in conditions
p8
aVthat can be hard, if not harsh,
p9
aVand that work has led me to believe
p10
aVthat we need a fundamentally different way
p11
aVof looking at healthcare.
p12
aVWe simply need a healthcare system
p13
aVthat moves beyond just looking at the symptoms
p14
aVthat bring people into clinics,
p15
aVbut instead actually is able to look
p16
aVand improve health where it begins.
p17
aVAnd where health begins
p18
aVis not in the four walls of a doctor's office,
p19
aVbut where we live
p20
aVand where we work,
p21
aVwhere we eat, sleep, learn and play,
p22
aVwhere we spend the majority of our lives.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo what does this different  approach to healthcare look like,
p25
aVan approach that can improve health where it begins?
p26
aVTo illustrate this, I'll tell you about Veronica.
p27
aVVeronica was the 17th patient
p28
aVout of my 26-patient day
p29
aVat that clinic in South Central Los Angeles.
p30
aVShe came into our clinic with a chronic headache.
p31
aVThis headache had been going on
p32
aVfor a number of years, and this particular episode
p33
aVwas very, very troubling.
p34
aVIn fact, three weeks before she came to visit us
p35
aVfor the first time, she went to an  emergency room in Los Angeles.
p36
aVThe emergency room doctors said,
p37
aV"We've run some tests, Veronica.
p38
aVThe results are normal, so here's some pain medication,
p39
aVand follow up with a primary care doctor,
p40
aVbut if the pain persists or if it worsens,
p41
aVthen come on back."
p42
aa(lp43
VVeronica followed those standard instructions
p44
aVand she went back.
p45
aVShe went back not just once, but twice more.
p46
aVIn the three weeks before Veronica met us,
p47
aVshe went to the emergency room three times.
p48
aVShe went back and forth,
p49
aVin and out of hospitals and clinics,
p50
aVjust like she had done in years past,
p51
aVtrying to seek relief but still coming up short.
p52
aVVeronica came to our clinic,
p53
aVand despite all these encounters with healthcare professionals,
p54
aVVeronica was still sick.
p55
aa(lp56
VWhen she came to our clinic, though,  we tried a different approach.
p57
aVOur approach started with our medical assistant,
p58
aVsomeone who had a GED-level training
p59
aVbut knew the community.
p60
aVOur medical assistant asked some routine questions.
p61
aVShe asked, "What's your chief complaint?"
p62
aV"Headache."
p63
aV"Let's get your vital signs" \u2014
p64
aVmeasure your blood pressure and your heart rate,
p65
aVbut let's also ask something equally as vital
p66
aVto Veronica and a lot of patients like her
p67
aVin South Los Angeles.
p68
aV"Veronica, can you tell me about where you live?
p69
aVSpecifically, about your housing conditions?
p70
aVDo you have mold? Do you have water leaks?
p71
aVDo you have roaches in your home?"
p72
aVTurns out, Veronica said yes to three of those things:
p73
aVroaches, water leaks, mold.
p74
aVI received that chart in hand, reviewed it,
p75
aVand I turned the handle on the door
p76
aVand I entered the room.
p77
aa(lp78
VYou should understand that Veronica,
p79
aVlike a lot of patients that I have the privilege of caring for,
p80
aVis a dignified person, a formidable presence,
p81
aVa personality that's larger than life,
p82
aVbut here she was
p83
aVdoubled over in pain sitting on my exam table.
p84
aVHer head, clearly throbbing, was resting in her hands.
p85
aVShe lifted her head up,
p86
aVand I saw her face, said hello,
p87
aVand then I immediately noticed something
p88
aVacross the bridge of her nose,
p89
aVa crease in her skin.
p90
aVIn medicine, we call that crease the allergic salute.
p91
aVIt's usually seen among children who have chronic allergies.
p92
aVIt comes from chronically rubbing one's nose up and down,
p93
aVtrying to get rid of those allergy symptoms,
p94
aVand yet, here was Veronica, a grown woman,
p95
aVwith the same telltale sign of allergies.
p96
aVA few minutes later, in asking Veronica some questions,
p97
aVand examining her and listening to her,
p98
aVI said, "Veronica, I think I know what you have.
p99
aVI think you have chronic allergies,
p100
aVand I think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion,
p101
aVand I think all of those are  related to where you live."
p102
aVShe looked a little bit relieved,
p103
aVbecause for the first time, she had a diagnosis,
p104
aVbut I said, "Veronica, now let's talk about your treatment.
p105
aVWe're going to order some medications for your symptoms,
p106
aVbut I also want to refer you to a specialist, if that's okay."
p107
aa(lp108
VNow, specialists are a little hard to find
p109
aVin South Central Los Angeles,
p110
aVso she gave me this look, like, "Really?"
p111
aVAnd I said, "Veronica, actually, the specialist I'm talking about
p112
aVis someone I call a community health worker,
p113
aVsomeone who, if it's okay with you,
p114
aVcan come to your home
p115
aVand try to understand what's going on
p116
aVwith those water leaks and that mold,
p117
aVtrying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms,
p118
aVand if required, that specialist might refer you
p119
aVto another specialist that we call a public interest lawyer,
p120
aVbecause it might be that your landlord
p121
aVisn't making the fixes he's required to make."
p122
aa(lp123
VVeronica came back in a few months later.
p124
aVShe agreed to all of those treatment plans.
p125
aVShe told us that her symptoms had improved by 90 percent.
p126
aVShe was spending more time at work
p127
aVand with her family and less time
p128
aVshuttling back and forth between the emergency rooms of Los Angeles.
p129
aVVeronica had improved remarkably.
p130
aVHer sons, one of whom had asthma,
p131
aVwere no longer as sick as they used to be.
p132
aVShe had gotten better, and not coincidentally,
p133
aVVeronica's home was better too.
p134
aa(lp135
VWhat was it about this different approach we tried
p136
aVthat led to better care,
p137
aVfewer visits to the E.R., better health?
p138
aVWell, quite simply, it started with that question:
p139
aV"Veronica, where do you live?"
p140
aVBut more importantly, it was that we put in place
p141
aVa system that allowed us to routinely ask questions
p142
aVto Veronica and hundreds more like her
p143
aVabout the conditions that mattered
p144
aVin her community, about where health,
p145
aVand unfortunately sometimes illness, do begin
p146
aVin places like South L.A.
p147
aVIn that community, substandard housing
p148
aVand food insecurity are the major conditions
p149
aVthat we as a clinic had to be aware of,
p150
aVbut in other communities it could be
p151
aVtransportation barriers, obesity,
p152
aVaccess to parks, gun violence.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe important thing is, we put in place a system
p155
aVthat worked,
p156
aVand it's an approach that I call an upstream approach.
p157
aVIt's a term many of you are familiar with.
p158
aVIt comes from a parable that's very common
p159
aVin the public health community.
p160
aVThis is a parable of three friends.
p161
aVImagine that you're one of these three friends
p162
aVwho come to a river.
p163
aVIt's a beautiful scene, but it's shattered by the cries of a child,
p164
aVand actually several children, in need of rescue in the water.
p165
aVSo you do hopefully what everybody would do.
p166
aVYou jump right in along with your friends.
p167
aVThe first friend says, I'm going to rescue those
p168
aVwho are about to drown,
p169
aVthose at most risk of falling over the waterfall.
p170
aVThe second friends says, I'm going to build a raft.
p171
aVI'm going to make sure that fewer people
p172
aVneed to end up at the waterfall's edge.
p173
aVLet's usher more people to safety
p174
aVby building this raft,
p175
aVcoordinating those branches together.
p176
aVOver time, they're successful, but not really,
p177
aVas much as they want to be.
p178
aVMore people slip through, and they finally look up
p179
aVand they see that their third friend
p180
aVis nowhere to be seen.
p181
aVThey finally spot her.
p182
aVShe's in the water. She's swimming away from them
p183
aVupstream, rescuing children as she goes,
p184
aVand they shout to her, "Where are you going?
p185
aVThere are children here to save."
p186
aVAnd she says back,
p187
aV"I'm going to find out
p188
aVwho or what is throwing these children in the water."
p189
aVIn healthcare, we have that first friend \u2014
p190
aVwe have the specialist,
p191
aVwe have the trauma surgeon, the ICU nurse,
p192
aVthe E.R. doctors.
p193
aVWe have those people that are vital rescuers,
p194
aVpeople you want to be there when you're in dire straits.
p195
aVWe also know that we have the second friend \u2014
p196
aVwe have that raft-builder.
p197
aVThat's the primary care clinician,
p198
aVpeople on the care team who are there
p199
aVto manage your chronic conditions,
p200
aVyour diabetes, your hypertension,
p201
aVthere to give you your annual checkups,
p202
aVthere to make sure your vaccines are up to date,
p203
aVbut also there to make sure that you have
p204
aVa raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety.
p205
aVBut while that's also vital and very necessary,
p206
aVwhat we're missing is that third friend.
p207
aVWe don't have enough of that upstreamist.
p208
aVThe upstreamists are the health care professionals
p209
aVwho know that health does begin
p210
aVwhere we live and work and play,
p211
aVbut beyond that awareness, is able to mobilize
p212
aVthe resources to create the system
p213
aVin their clinics and in their hospitals
p214
aVthat really does start to approach that,
p215
aVto connect people to the resources they need
p216
aVoutside the four walls of the clinic.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow you might ask, and it's  a very obvious question
p219
aVthat a lot of colleagues in medicine ask:
p220
aV"Doctors and nurses thinking about transportation and housing?
p221
aVShouldn't we just provide pills and procedures
p222
aVand just make sure we focus on the task at hand?"
p223
aVCertainly, rescuing people at the water's edge
p224
aVis important enough work.
p225
aVWho has the time?
p226
aVI would argue, though, that if we were to use science as our guide,
p227
aVthat we would find an upstream approach is absolutely necessary.
p228
aVScientists now know that
p229
aVthe living and working conditions that we all
p230
aVare part of
p231
aVhave more than twice the impact on our health
p232
aVthan does our genetic code,
p233
aVand living and working conditions,
p234
aVthe structures of our environments,
p235
aVthe ways in which our social fabric is woven together,
p236
aVand the impact those have on our behaviors,
p237
aVall together, those have more than five times
p238
aVthe impact on our health
p239
aVthan do all the pills and procedures
p240
aVadministered by doctors and hospitals combined.
p241
aVAll together, living and working conditions
p242
aVaccount for 60 percent of preventable death.
p243
aa(lp244
VLet me give you an example of what this feels like.
p245
aVLet's say there was a company, a tech startup
p246
aVthat came to you and said, "We have a great product.
p247
aVIt's going to lower your risk of death from heart disease."
p248
aVNow, you might be likely to invest
p249
aVif that product was a drug or a device,
p250
aVbut what if that product was a park?
p251
aVA study in the U.K.,
p252
aVa landmark study that reviewed the records
p253
aVof over 40 million residents in the U.K.,
p254
aVlooked at several variables,
p255
aVcontrolled for a lot of factors, and found that
p256
aVwhen trying to adjust the risk of heart disease,
p257
aVone's exposure to green space was a powerful influence.
p258
aVThe closer you were to green space,
p259
aVto parks and trees,
p260
aVthe lower your chance of heart disease,
p261
aVand that stayed true for rich and for poor.
p262
aVThat study illustrates what my friends in public health
p263
aVoften say these days:
p264
aVthat one's zip code matters more
p265
aVthan your genetic code.
p266
aVWe're also learning that zip code
p267
aVis actually shaping our genetic code.
p268
aVThe science of epigenetics looks at those molecular mechanisms,
p269
aVthose intricate ways in which our DNA is literally shaped,
p270
aVgenes turned on and off
p271
aVbased on the exposures to the environment,
p272
aVto where we live and to where we work.
p273
aVSo it's clear that these factors,
p274
aVthese upstream issues, do matter.
p275
aVThey matter to our health,
p276
aVand therefore our healthcare professionals should do something about it.
p277
aVAnd yet, Veronica asked me
p278
aVperhaps the most compelling question
p279
aVI've been asked in a long time.
p280
aVIn that follow-up visit, she said,
p281
aV"Why did none of my doctors
p282
aVask about my home before?
p283
aVIn those visits to the emergency room,
p284
aVI had two CAT scans,
p285
aVI had a needle placed in the lower part of my back
p286
aVto collect spinal fluid,
p287
aVI had nearly a dozen blood tests.
p288
aVI went back and forth, I saw all sorts of people in healthcare,
p289
aVand no one asked about my home."
p290
aa(lp291
VThe honest answer is that in healthcare,
p292
aVwe often treat symptoms without addressing
p293
aVthe conditions that make you sick in the first place.
p294
aVAnd there are many reasons for that, but the big three
p295
aVare first, we don't pay for that.
p296
aVIn healthcare, we often pay  for volume and not value.
p297
aVWe pay doctors and hospitals usually
p298
aVfor the number of services they provide,
p299
aVbut not necessarily on how healthy they make you.
p300
aVThat leads to a second phenomenon that I call
p301
aVthe "don't ask, don't tell" approach
p302
aVto upstream issues in healthcare.
p303
aVWe don't ask about where you live and where you work,
p304
aVbecause if there's a problem there,
p305
aVwe don't know what to tell you.
p306
aVIt's not that doctors don't know these are important issues.
p307
aVIn a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians,
p308
aVover 1,000 physicians,
p309
aV80 percent of them actually said that
p310
aVthey know that their patients' upstream problems
p311
aVare as important as their health issues,
p312
aVas their medical problems,
p313
aVand yet despite that widespread awareness
p314
aVof the importance of upstream issues,
p315
aVonly one in five doctors said they had
p316
aVany sense of confidence to address those issues,
p317
aVto improve health where it begins.
p318
aVThere's this gap between knowing
p319
aVthat patients' lives, the context of where they live and work,
p320
aVmatters, and the ability to do something about it
p321
aVin the systems in which we work.
p322
aa(lp323
VThis is a huge problem right now,
p324
aVbecause it leads them to this next question, which is,
p325
aVwhose responsibility is it?
p326
aVAnd that brings me to that third point,
p327
aVthat third answer to Veronica's compelling question.
p328
aVPart of the reason that we have this conundrum
p329
aVis because there are not nearly enough upstreamists
p330
aVin the healthcare system.
p331
aVThere are not nearly enough of that third friend,
p332
aVthat person who is going to find out
p333
aVwho or what is throwing those kids in the water.
p334
aVNow, there are many upstreamists,
p335
aVand I've had the privilege of meeting many of them,
p336
aVin Los Angeles and in other parts of the country
p337
aVand around the world,
p338
aVand it's important to note that upstreamists
p339
aVsometimes are doctors, but they need not be.
p340
aVThey can be nurses, other clinicians,
p341
aVcare managers, social workers.
p342
aVIt's not so important what specific degree
p343
aVupstreamists have at the end of their name.
p344
aVWhat's more important is that they all seem
p345
aVto share the same ability to implement a process
p346
aVthat transforms their assistance,
p347
aVtransforms the way they practice medicine.
p348
aVThat process is a quite simple process.
p349
aVIt's one, two and three.
p350
aVFirst, they sit down and they say,
p351
aVlet's identify the clinical problem
p352
aVamong a certain set of patients.
p353
aVLet's say, for instance,
p354
aVlet's try to help children
p355
aVwho are bouncing in and out of the hospital
p356
aVwith asthma.
p357
aVAfter identifying the problem, they  then move on to that second step,
p358
aVand they say, let's identify the root cause.
p359
aVNow, a root cause analysis, in healthcare,
p360
aVusually says, well, let's look at your genes,
p361
aVlet's look at how you're behaving.
p362
aVMaybe you're not eating healthy enough.
p363
aVEat healthier.
p364
aVIt's a pretty simplistic
p365
aVapproach to root cause analyses.
p366
aVIt turns out, it doesn't really work
p367
aVwhen we just limit ourselves that worldview.
p368
aVThe root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings
p369
aVto the table is to say, let's look at the living
p370
aVand the working conditions in your life.
p371
aVPerhaps, for children with asthma,
p372
aVit's what's happening in their home,
p373
aVor perhaps they live close to a freeway with major air pollution
p374
aVthat triggers their asthma.
p375
aVAnd perhaps that's what we should mobilize our resources to address,
p376
aVbecause that third element, that third part of the process,
p377
aVis that next critical part of what upstreamists do.
p378
aVThey mobilize the resources to create a solution,
p379
aVboth within the clinical system,
p380
aVand then by bringing in people from public health,
p381
aVfrom other sectors, lawyers,
p382
aVwhoever is willing to play ball,
p383
aVlet's bring in to create a solution that makes sense,
p384
aVto take those patients who actually have clinical problems
p385
aVand address their root causes together
p386
aVby linking them to the resources you need.
p387
aVIt's clear to me that there are so many stories
p388
aVof upstreamists who are doing remarkable things.
p389
aVThe problem is that there's just not nearly enough of them out there.
p390
aVBy some estimates, we need one upstreamist
p391
aVfor every 20 to 30 clinicians in the healthcare system.
p392
aVIn the U.S., for instance, that would mean
p393
aVthat we need 25,000 upstreamists
p394
aVby the year 2020.
p395
aVBut we only have a few thousand upstreamists out there right now, by all accounts,
p396
aVand that's why, a few years ago, my colleagues and I
p397
aVsaid, you know what, we need to train
p398
aVand make more upstreamists.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo we decided to start an organization
p401
aVcalled Health Begins,
p402
aVand Health Begins simply does that:
p403
aVWe train upstreamists.
p404
aVAnd there are a lot of measures that we use for our success,
p405
aVbut the main thing that we're interested in
p406
aVis making sure that we're changing
p407
aVthe sense of confidence,
p408
aVthat "don't ask, don't tell" metric among clinicians.
p409
aVWe're trying to make sure that clinicians,
p410
aVand therefore their systems that they work in
p411
aVhave the ability, the confidence
p412
aVto address the problems in the living
p413
aVand working conditions in our lives.
p414
aVWe're seeing nearly a tripling
p415
aVof that confidence in our work.
p416
aa(lp417
VIt's remarkable,
p418
aVbut I'll tell you the most compelling part
p419
aVof what it means to be working
p420
aVwith upstreamists to gather them together.
p421
aVWhat is most compelling is that every day,
p422
aVevery week, I hear stories just like Veronica's.
p423
aVThere are stories out there of Veronica
p424
aVand many more like her,
p425
aVpeople who are coming to the healthcare system
p426
aVand getting a glimpse of what it feels like
p427
aVto be part of something that works,
p428
aVa health care system that stops bouncing you back and forth
p429
aVbut actually improves your health,
p430
aVlistens to you who you are,
p431
aVaddresses the context of your life,
p432
aVwhether you're rich or poor or middle class.
p433
aa(lp434
VThese stories are compelling because
p435
aVnot only do they tell us that we're this close
p436
aVto getting the healthcare system that we want,
p437
aVbut that there's something that we can all do to get there.
p438
aVDoctors and nurses can get better at asking
p439
aVabout the context of patients' lives,
p440
aVnot simply because it's better bedside manner,
p441
aVbut frankly, because it's a better standard of care.
p442
aVHealthcare systems and payers
p443
aVcan start to bring in public health agencies
p444
aVand departments and say,
p445
aVlet's look at our data together.
p446
aVLet's see if we can discover some patterns in our data about our patients' lives
p447
aVand see if we can identify an upstream cause,
p448
aVand then, as importantly, can we align the resources
p449
aVto be able to address them?
p450
aVMedical schools, nursing schools,
p451
aVall sorts of health professional education programs
p452
aVcan help by training the next generation of upstreamists.
p453
aVWe can also make sure that these schools
p454
aVcertify a backbone of the upstream approach,
p455
aVand that's the community health worker.
p456
aVWe need many more of them in the healthcare system
p457
aVif we're truly going to have it be effective,
p458
aVto move from a sickcare system
p459
aVto a healthcare system.
p460
aVBut finally, and perhaps most importantly,
p461
aVwhat do we do? What do we do as patients?
p462
aVWe can start by simply going to our doctors
p463
aVand our nurses, to our clinics,
p464
aVand asking, "Is there something in where I live
p465
aVand where I work that I should be aware of?"
p466
aVAre there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of,
p467
aVand more importantly, if there are barriers
p468
aVthat I'm surfacing, if I'm coming to you
p469
aVand I'm saying I think have a problem with
p470
aVmy apartment or at my workplace
p471
aVor I don't have access to transportation,
p472
aVor there's a park that's way too far,
p473
aVso sorry doctor, I can't take your advice
p474
aVto go and jog,
p475
aVif those problems exist,
p476
aVthen doctor, are you willing to listen?
p477
aVAnd what can we do together
p478
aVto improve my health where it begins?
p479
aa(lp480
VIf we're all able to do this work,
p481
aVdoctors and healthcare systems,
p482
aVpayers, and all of us together,
p483
aVwe'll realize something about health.
p484
aVHealth is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon.
p485
aVHealth is a common good.
p486
aVIt comes from our personal investment in knowing
p487
aVthat our lives matter,
p488
aVthe context of where we live and where we work,
p489
aVeat, and sleep, matter,
p490
aVand that what we do for ourselves,
p491
aVwe also should do for those
p492
aVwhose living and working conditions
p493
aVagain, can be hard, if not harsh.
p494
aVWe can all invest in making sure that we improve
p495
aVthe allocation of resources upstream,
p496
aVbut at the same time work together
p497
aVand show that we can move healthcare
p498
aVupstream.
p499
aVWe can improve health where it begins.

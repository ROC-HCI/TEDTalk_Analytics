VI'm a believer.
p5
aVI'm a believer in global warming,
p6
aVand my record is good
p7
aVon the subject.
p8
aVBut my subject
p9
aVis national security.
p10
aVWe have to get off of oil purchased
p11
aVfrom the enemy.
p12
aVI'm talking about OPEC oil.
p13
aVAnd let me take you back
p14
aV100 years
p15
aVto 1912.
p16
aVYou're probably thinking that was my birth year.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVIt wasn't. It was 1928.
p19
aVBut go back to 1912,
p20
aV100 years ago,
p21
aVand look at that point
p22
aVwhat we, our country, was faced with.
p23
aVIt's the same energy question
p24
aVthat you're looking at today,
p25
aVbut it's different sources of fuel.
p26
aVA hundred years ago
p27
aVwe were looking at coal, of course,
p28
aVand we were looking at whale oil
p29
aVand we were looking at crude oil.
p30
aVAt that point,
p31
aVwe were looking for a fuel
p32
aVthat was cleaner,
p33
aVit was cheaper,
p34
aVand it wasn't ours though,
p35
aVit was theirs.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo at that point, 1912,
p38
aVwe selected crude oil over whale oil
p39
aVand some more coal.
p40
aVBut as we moved on
p41
aVto the period now, 100 years later,
p42
aVwe're back really
p43
aVat another decision point.
p44
aVWhat is the decision point?
p45
aVIt's what we're going to use
p46
aVin the future.
p47
aVSo from here,
p48
aVit's pretty clear to me,
p49
aVwe would prefer to have
p50
aVcleaner, cheaper,
p51
aVdomestic, ours \u2014
p52
aVand we have that, we have that \u2014
p53
aVwhich is natural gas.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo here you are,
p56
aVthat the cost of all this to the world
p57
aVis 89 million barrels of oil,
p58
aVgive or take a few barrels, every day.
p59
aVAnd the cost annually
p60
aVis three trillion dollars.
p61
aVAnd one trillion of that
p62
aVgoes to OPEC.
p63
aVThat has got to be stopped.
p64
aVNow if you look at the cost of OPEC,
p65
aVit cost seven trillion dollars \u2014
p66
aVon the Milken Institute study last year \u2014
p67
aVseven trillion dollars
p68
aVsince 1976,
p69
aVis what we paid for oil from OPEC.
p70
aVNow that includes the cost of military
p71
aVand the cost of the fuel both.
p72
aVBut it's the greatest transfer of wealth,
p73
aVfrom one group to another
p74
aVin the history of mankind.
p75
aVAnd it continues.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow when you look
p78
aVat where is the transfer of wealth,
p79
aVyou can see here
p80
aVthat we have the arrows
p81
aVgoing into the Mid-East
p82
aVand away from us.
p83
aVAnd with that,
p84
aVwe have found ourselves
p85
aVto be the world's policemen.
p86
aVWe are policing the world,
p87
aVand how are we doing that?
p88
aVI know the response to this.
p89
aVI would bet there aren't 10 percent of you in the room
p90
aVthat know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world.
p91
aVRaise your hand if you think you know.
p92
aVThere are 12.
p93
aVOne is under construction by the Chinese
p94
aVand the other 11 belong to us.
p95
aa(lp96
VWhy do we have 11 aircraft carriers?
p97
aVDo we have a corner on the market?
p98
aVAre we smarter than anybody else? I'm not sure.
p99
aVIf you look at where they're located \u2014
p100
aVand on this slide it's the red blobs on there \u2014
p101
aVthere are five that are operating in the Mid-East,
p102
aVand the rest of them are in the United States.
p103
aVThey just move back to the Mid-East and those come back.
p104
aVSo actually most of the 11 we have
p105
aVare tied up in the Mid-East.
p106
aVWhy? Why are they in the Mid-East?
p107
aVThey're there to control,
p108
aVkeep the shipping lanes open
p109
aVand make oil available.
p110
aVAnd the United States uses about 20 million barrels a day,
p111
aVwhich is about 25 percent of all the oil used
p112
aVeveryday in the world.
p113
aVAnd we're doing it with four percent of the population.
p114
aVSomehow that doesn't seem right.
p115
aVThat's not sustainable.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo where do we go from here?
p118
aVDoes that continue?
p119
aVYes, it's going to continue.
p120
aVThe slide you're looking at here
p121
aVis 1990 to 2040.
p122
aVOver that period
p123
aVyou are going to double your demand.
p124
aVAnd when you look at what we're using the oil for,
p125
aV70 percent of it
p126
aVis used for transportation fuel.
p127
aVSo when somebody says,
p128
aV"Let's go more nuclear,
p129
aVlet's go wind, let's go solar,"
p130
aVfine; I'm for anything American,
p131
aVanything American.
p132
aVBut if you're going to do anything
p133
aVabout the dependency on foreign oil,
p134
aVyou have to address transportation.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo here we are
p137
aVusing 20 million barrels a day \u2014
p138
aVproducing eight, importing 12,
p139
aVand from the 12,
p140
aVfive comes from OPEC.
p141
aVWhen you look at the biggest user and the second largest user,
p142
aVwe use 20 million barrels
p143
aVand the Chinese use 10.
p144
aVThe Chinese have a little bit better plan \u2014
p145
aVor they have a plan;
p146
aVwe have no plan.
p147
aVIn the history of America,
p148
aVwe've never had an energy plan.
p149
aVWe don't even realize the resources
p150
aVthat we have available to us.
p151
aVIf you take the last 10 years
p152
aVand bring forward,
p153
aVyou've transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars.
p154
aVIf you go forward the next 10 years
p155
aVand cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a barrel,
p156
aVyou will pay 2.2 trillion.
p157
aVThat's not sustainable either.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut the days of cheap oil are over.
p160
aVThey're over.
p161
aVThey make it very clear to you,
p162
aVthe Saudis do,
p163
aVthey have to have 94 dollars a barrel
p164
aVto make their social commitments.
p165
aVNow I had people in Washington last week told me,
p166
aVhe said, "The Saudis can produce the oil
p167
aVfor five dollars a barrel.
p168
aVThat has nothing to do with it.
p169
aVIt's what they have to pay for
p170
aVis what we are going to pay for oil."
p171
aVThere is no free market for oil.
p172
aVThe oil is priced off the margin.
p173
aVAnd the OPEC nations
p174
aVare the ones that price the oil.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo where are we headed from here?
p177
aVWe're headed to natural gas.
p178
aVNatural gas will do everything
p179
aVwe want it to do.
p180
aVIt's 130 octane fuel.
p181
aVIt's 25 percent cleaner than oil.
p182
aVIt's ours, we have an abundance of it.
p183
aVAnd it does not require a refinery.
p184
aVIt comes out of the ground at 130 octane.
p185
aVRun it through the separator and you're ready to use it.
p186
aVIt's going to be very simple for us to use.
p187
aVIt's going to be simple to accomplish this.
p188
aVYou're going to find, and I'll tell you in just a minute,
p189
aVwhat you're looking for to make it happen.
p190
aVBut here you can look at the list.
p191
aVNatural gas will fit all of those.
p192
aVIt will replace or be able to be used for that.
p193
aVIt's for power generation, transportation,
p194
aVit's peaking fuel, it's all those.
p195
aa(lp196
VDo we have enough natural gas?
p197
aVLook at the bar on the left. It's 24 trillion.
p198
aVIt's what we use a year.
p199
aVGo forward
p200
aVand the estimates that you have
p201
aVfrom the EIA and onto the industry estimates \u2014
p202
aVthe industry knows what they're talking about \u2014
p203
aVwe've got 4,000 trillion cubic feet
p204
aVof natural gas that's available to us.
p205
aVHow does that translate
p206
aVto barrels of oil equivalent?
p207
aVIt would be three times
p208
aVwhat the Saudis claim they have.
p209
aVAnd they claim they have 250 billion barrels of oil,
p210
aVwhich I do not believe.
p211
aVI think it's probably 175 billion barrels.
p212
aVBut anyway, whether they say they're right or whatever,
p213
aVwe have plenty of natural gas.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo I have tried to target
p216
aVon where we use the natural gas.
p217
aVAnd where I've targeted
p218
aVis on the heavy-duty trucks.
p219
aVThere are eight million of them.
p220
aVYou take eight million trucks \u2014
p221
aVthese are 18-wheelers \u2014
p222
aVand take them to natural gas,
p223
aVreduce carbon by 30 percent,
p224
aVit is cheaper
p225
aVand it will cut our imports
p226
aVthree million barrels.
p227
aVSo you will cut 60 percent off of OPEC
p228
aVwith eight million trucks.
p229
aVThere are 250 million vehicles in America.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo what you have
p232
aVis natural gas is the bridge fuel,
p233
aVis the way I see it.
p234
aVI don't have to worry
p235
aVabout the bridge to where at my age.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVThat's your concern.
p238
aVBut when you look at the natural gas we have
p239
aVit could very well be
p240
aVthe bridge to natural gas,
p241
aVbecause you have plenty of natural gas.
p242
aVBut as I said, I'm for anything American.
p243
aa(lp244
VNow let me take you \u2014 I've been a realist \u2014
p245
aVI went from theorist early to realist.
p246
aVI'm back to theorist again.
p247
aVIf you look at the world,
p248
aVyou have methane hydrates in the ocean
p249
aVaround every continent.
p250
aVAnd here you can see methane,
p251
aVif that's the way you're going to go,
p252
aVthat there's plenty of methane \u2014
p253
aVnatural gas is methane,
p254
aVmethane and natural gas are interchangeable \u2014
p255
aVbut if you decide
p256
aVthat you're going to use some methane \u2014
p257
aVand I'm gone, so it's up to you \u2014
p258
aVbut we do have
p259
aVplenty of methane hydrates.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo I think I've made my point
p262
aVthat we have to get on our own resources in America.
p263
aVIf we do \u2014
p264
aVit's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil.
p265
aVAnd yet, we have no energy plan.
p266
aVSo there's nothing going on
p267
aVthat impresses me
p268
aVin Washington on that plan,
p269
aVother than I'm trying to focus
p270
aVon that eight million 18-wheelers.
p271
aVIf we could do that,
p272
aVI think we would take our first step
p273
aVto an energy plan.
p274
aVIf we did, we could see
p275
aVthat our own resources are easier to use
p276
aVthan anybody can imagine.
p277
aa(lp278
VThank you.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Applause)
p281
aa(lp282
VChris Anderson: Thanks for that.
p283
aVSo from your point of view,
p284
aVyou had this great Pickens Plan
p285
aVthat was based on wind energy,
p286
aVand you abandoned it basically
p287
aVbecause the economics changed.
p288
aVWhat happened?
p289
aa(lp290
VTBP: I lost 150 million dollars.
p291
aV(Laughter)
p292
aVThat'll make you abandon something.
p293
aVNo, what happened to us, Chris,
p294
aVis that power, it's priced off the margin.
p295
aVAnd so the margin is natural gas.
p296
aVAnd at the time I went into the wind business,
p297
aVnatural gas was nine dollars.
p298
aVToday it's two dollars and forty cents.
p299
aVYou cannot do a wind deal
p300
aVunder six dollars an MCF.
p301
aa(lp302
VCA: So what happened was
p303
aVthat, through increased ability
p304
aVto use fracking technology,
p305
aVthe calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded
p306
aVand the price plummeted,
p307
aVwhich made wind uncompetitive.
p308
aVIn a nutshell that's what happened?
p309
aa(lp310
VTBP: That's what happened.
p311
aVWe found out that we could go to the source rock,
p312
aVwhich were the carboniferous shales in the basins.
p313
aVThe first one was Barnett Shale in Texas
p314
aVand then the Marcellus up in the Northeast
p315
aVacross New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia;
p316
aVand Haynesville in Louisiana.
p317
aVThis stuff is everywhere.
p318
aVWe are overwhelmed with natural gas.
p319
aa(lp320
VCA: And now you're a big investor in that and bringing that to market?
p321
aa(lp322
VTBP: Well you say a big investor.
p323
aVIt's my life.
p324
aVI'm a geologist, got out of school in '51,
p325
aVand I've been in the industry my entire life.
p326
aVNow I do own stocks.
p327
aVI'm not a big natural gas producer.
p328
aVSomebody the other day said
p329
aVI was the second largest natural gas producer in the United States.
p330
aVDon't I wish.
p331
aVBut no, I'm not. I own stocks.
p332
aVBut I also am in the fueling business.
p333
aa(lp334
VCA: But natural gas is a fossil fuel.
p335
aVYou burn it,
p336
aVyou release CO2.
p337
aVSo you believe in the threat of climate change.
p338
aVWhy doesn't that prospect
p339
aVconcern you?
p340
aa(lp341
VTBP: Well you're going to have to use something.
p342
aVWhat do you have to replace it?
p343
aV(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
VCA: No, no. The argument that it's a bridge fuel makes sense,
p346
aVbecause the amount of CO2 per unit of energy
p347
aVis lower than oil and coal, correct?
p348
aVAnd so everyone can be at least happy
p349
aVto see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas.
p350
aVBut if that's it
p351
aVand that becomes the reason
p352
aVthat renewables don't get invested in,
p353
aVthen, long-term, we're screwed anyway, right?
p354
aa(lp355
VTBP: Well I'm not ready to give up,
p356
aVbut Jim and I talked
p357
aVthere as he left,
p358
aVand I said, "How do you feel about natural gas?"
p359
aVAnd he said, "Well it's a bridge fuel, is what it is."
p360
aVAnd I said, "Bridge to what?
p361
aVWhere are we headed?"
p362
aVSee but again, I told you, I don't have to worry with that.
p363
aVYou all do.
p364
aa(lp365
VCA: But I don't think that's right, Boone.
p366
aVI think you're a person who believes in your legacy.
p367
aVYou've made the money you need.
p368
aVYou're one of the few people in a position
p369
aVto really swing the debate.
p370
aVDo you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon?
p371
aVDoes that make sense?
p372
aa(lp373
VTBP: I don't like that
p374
aVbecause it ends up the government is going to run the program.
p375
aVI can tell you it will be a failure.
p376
aVThe government is not successful
p377
aVon these things.
p378
aVThey just aren't, it's a bad deal.
p379
aVLook at Solyndra, or whatever it was.
p380
aVI mean, that was told to be a bad idea 10 times,
p381
aVthey went ahead and did it anyway.
p382
aVBut that only blew out 500 million.
p383
aVI think it's closer to a billion.
p384
aVBut Chris, I think where we're headed,
p385
aVthe long-term,
p386
aVI don't mind going back to nuclear.
p387
aVAnd I can tell you what the last page
p388
aVof the report that will take them five years to write
p389
aVwill be.
p390
aVOne, don't build a reformer on a fault.
p391
aV(Laughter)
p392
aVAnd number two,
p393
aVdo not build a reformer on the ocean.
p394
aVAnd now I think reformers are safe.
p395
aVMove them inland
p396
aVand on very stable ground
p397
aVand build the reformers.
p398
aVThere isn't anything wrong with nuke.
p399
aVYou're going to have to have energy. There is no question.
p400
aVYou can't \u2014 okay.
p401
aa(lp402
VCA: One of the questions from the audience
p403
aVis, with fracking and the natural gas process,
p404
aVwhat about the problem of methane leaking from that,
p405
aVmethane being a worse global warming gas
p406
aVthan CO2?
p407
aVIs that a concern?
p408
aa(lp409
VTBP: Fracking? What is fracking?
p410
aa(lp411
VCA: Fracking.
p412
aa(lp413
VTBP: I'm teasing.
p414
aa(lp415
V(Laughter)
p416
aa(lp417
VCA: We've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here, you know.
p418
aa(lp419
VTBP: No, let me tell you,
p420
aVI've told you what my age was.
p421
aVI got out of school in '51.
p422
aVI witnessed my first frack job
p423
aVat border Texas in 1953.
p424
aVFracking came out in '47,
p425
aVand don't believe for a minute
p426
aVwhen our president gets up there
p427
aVand says the Department of Energy 30 years ago
p428
aVdeveloped fracking.
p429
aVI don't know what in the hell he's talking about.
p430
aVI mean seriously, the Department of Energy
p431
aVdid not have anything to do with fracking.
p432
aVThe first frack job was in '47.
p433
aVI saw my first one in '53.
p434
aVI've fracked over 3,000 wells in my life.
p435
aVNever had a problem
p436
aVwith messing up an aquifer or anything else.
p437
aVNow the largest aquifer in North America
p438
aVis from Midland, Texas to the South Dakota border,
p439
aVacross eight states \u2014
p440
aVbig aquifer:
p441
aVOgallala, Triassic age.
p442
aVThere had to have been 800,000 wells fracked
p443
aVin Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas
p444
aVin that aquifer.
p445
aVThere's no problems.
p446
aVI don't understand why
p447
aVthe media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania.
p448
aa(lp449
VCA: All right, so you don't support a carbon tax of any kind
p450
aVor a price on carbon.
p451
aVYour picture then I guess
p452
aVof how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels
p453
aVis through innovation ultimately,
p454
aVthat we'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive?
p455
aa(lp456
VTBP: Solar and wind, Jim and I agreed on that in 13 seconds.
p457
aVThat is, it's going to be a small part,
p458
aVbecause you can't rely on it.
p459
aa(lp460
VCA: So how does the world get off fossil fuels?
p461
aa(lp462
VTBP: How do we get there?
p463
aVWe have so much natural gas,
p464
aVa day will not come
p465
aVwhere you say, "Well let's don't use that anymore."
p466
aVYou'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all.
p467
aVAnd if you look at California,
p468
aVthey use 2,500 buses.
p469
aVLAMTA have been on natural gas
p470
aVfor 25 years.
p471
aVThe Ft. Worth T
p472
aVhas been on it for 25 years.
p473
aVWhy? Air quality was the reason they used natural gas
p474
aVand got away from diesel.
p475
aVWhy are all the trash trucks today in Southern California
p476
aVon natural gas?
p477
aVIt's because of air quality.
p478
aVI know what you're telling me, and I'm not disagreeing with you.
p479
aVHow in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point?
p480
aVAnd I say, that is your problem.
p481
aa(lp482
V(Laughter)
p483
aa(lp484
VCA: All right,
p485

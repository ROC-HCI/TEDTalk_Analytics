VYou know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that
p5
aVI'm really here by accident.
p6
aVAnd what I mean \u2014 not at TED \u2014 that I'm \u2014
p7
aVat this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances
p8
aVI would truly consider an accident.
p9
aVBut what I'd like to talk to you about today
p10
aVis perhaps a way in which we could use technology
p11
aVto make those accidents happen often.
p12
aVBecause I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up
p13
aVin this accident, technology played a big role in that.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo, what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself,
p16
aVbecause I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you.
p17
aVAnd I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today
p18
aVare children and education.
p19
aVAnd once I put that in context,
p20
aVI'd like to tell you a little bit about technology:
p21
aVwhy I believe technology is a tremendous enabler;
p22
aVa very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges.
p23
aVThen, about the initiative that Chris mentioned,
p24
aVthat we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15.
p25
aVAnd then I'll come back to the beginning,
p26
aVand tell you a little bit more \u2014 hopefully convince you \u2014
p27
aVthat I believe that in today's world,
p28
aVit is really important for business leaders
p29
aVnot only to have an idea of what their business is all about,
p30
aVbut to have a passion for something that is meaningful.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you,
p33
aVI'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women.
p34
aVSo I grew up in a family of women.
p35
aVI learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVAnd, as you can imagine, if you can picture this:
p38
aVI was born in a very small village in Mexico,
p39
aVin, unfortunately, very poor surroundings,
p40
aVand my parents did not have a college education.
p41
aVBut I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters.
p42
aVThat kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis
p43
aVthat my parents placed on education.
p44
aVMy parents were fanatics about learning,
p45
aVand I'll come back to that a little bit later.
p46
aa(lp47
VBut one of the things that exposed me early to learning,
p48
aVand a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child,
p49
aVwas through a technology which is on the screen \u2014 is a Victrola.
p50
aVMy father found that in a junkyard,
p51
aVand was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow \u2014
p52
aVto this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware
p53
aVof what was going on in the world \u2014 but,
p54
aVby inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old,
p55
aVand playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me
p56
aVhow Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever,
p57
aVand how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites,
p58
aVwas a real exposure to me to classical music.
p59
aVHe explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes
p60
aVthat became so famous in the world.
p61
aVAnd would tell me a little bit about history too,
p62
aVwhen he'd play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky
p63
aVon this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia
p64
aVand all the things that were happening in Russia at those times
p65
aVand why this music,
p66
aVin some way, represented a little bit of that history.
p67
aVAnd even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity.
p68
aVAnd perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech,
p69
aVbut if you can imagine the time when this occurred \u2014
p70
aVit was in the mid '40s \u2014 this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech.
p71
aa(lp72
VWell, one of the things that is really critical to try to
p73
aVdistill from that experience is that in addition to that,
p74
aVpeople ask me and say, "Well,
p75
aVhow did your parents treat you when you were a child?"
p76
aVAnd I always said that they were really tough on me.
p77
aVAnd not tough in the sense that most people think of,
p78
aVwhere your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever.
p79
aVThey were tough in the sense that, as I grew up,
p80
aVboth my mother and father would always say to me,
p81
aVit's really important that you always remember two things.
p82
aVFirst of all, when you go to bed at night,
p83
aVyou've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt
p84
aVthe day was a day which you contributed something, and
p85
aVthat you did everything you could to do it the best way you could.
p86
aVAnd the second thing they said: and we trust you,
p87
aVthat no matter where you are or where you go,
p88
aVyou will always do the right thing.
p89
aVNow, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids,
p90
aVbut if you do, please trust me,
p91
aVit's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say \u2014
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aV\u2014 we trust you that you will always do the right thing.
p94
aVWhen I was out with my friends drinking beer,
p95
aVI always was very aware of those words \u2014
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
V\u2014 and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology
p99
aVis that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course,
p100
aVbut it can only be helpful too if it's accessible,
p101
aVand it can only be helpful if it's affordable.
p102
aVAnd in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible
p103
aVis not necessarily what happens
p104
aVin a lot of the technology that is done today.
p105
aVSo, one of our passions in our company,
p106
aVand now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard
p107
aVat making the technology useful, accessible and affordable.
p108
aVAnd to me, that is very, very critical.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days.
p111
aVYou know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers.
p112
aVA tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet.
p113
aVAlthough frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app.
p114
aVWhat we believe is that the Internet, frankly,
p115
aVis a connection of people and ideas.
p116
aVThe Internet happens to be just the medium
p117
aVin which those people and ideas get connected.
p118
aVAnd the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome.
p119
aVAnd so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred,
p120
aVthat we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity.
p121
aVIf we can connect people and ideas more intensely \u2014 and although
p122
aVyou've seen a plethora and a myriad of products
p123
aVthat have come to the market today, the key to me is
p124
aVhow many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way,
p125
aVaccessibility, in an easy manner,
p126
aVand also affordability, that
p127
aVregardless of the economic status that a person could have,
p128
aVthat they could have the opportunity to afford this technology.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then,
p131
aVenable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative.
p132
aVAnd a couple of years ago at AMD,
p133
aVwe came up with this idea of saying,
p134
aVwhat if we create this initiative we call 50x15,
p135
aVwhere we are going to aim, that by the year 2015,
p136
aVhalf of the world will be connected to the Internet
p137
aVso that people and ideas can get connected.
p138
aVWe knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means
p139
aVdid we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone.
p140
aVWe always felt that this was something that could be done
p141
aVthrough partnerships with governments, industry,
p142
aVeducational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors.
p143
aVSo, it is really a rather lofty initiative,
p144
aVif you want to think that way,
p145
aVbut we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead,
p146
aVthat was bold enough and courageous enough
p147
aVthat it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently.
p148
aVAnd I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think
p149
aVthe results so far have been remarkable,
p150
aVand I can only anticipate and get real excited about
p151
aVwhat I think is going to happen in the next eight years,
p152
aVwhile we get to the 2015 initiative.
p153
aa(lp154
VWhere are we today?
p155
aVThat's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com.
p156
aVThose of you who've never looked at their website,
p157
aVyou should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see
p158
aVhow the Internet penetration has changed over the years.
p159
aVAnd so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say
p160
aVwell, where are we related to our goal towards 2015,
p161
aVthe thing that becomes apparent is three pieces.
p162
aVOne is the Western world,
p163
aVdefined mostly by Western Europe and the United States,
p164
aVhas made an awful lot of progress.
p165
aVThe connectivity in these parts of the world
p166
aVare really truly phenomenal and continue to increase.
p167
aa(lp168
VAs a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable,
p169
aVeven before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries,
p170
aVsuch as India and China, the progress has been good \u2014
p171
aVhas been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed,
p172
aVplaces like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world,
p173
aVthe progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact,
p174
aVI was just recently visiting South Africa.
p175
aVI had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki,
p176
aVand one of the things that we talked about is, what is it
p177
aVthat's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster?
p178
aVAnd one of the reasons is, in South Africa,
p179
aVit costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity.
p180
aVIt is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost,
p181
aVto be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach.
p182
aVSo, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner
p183
aVto be able to bring the cost of this technology down.
p184
aVSo, when you look at this chart,
p185
aVyou look at the very last \u2014 it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale \u2014
p186
aVyou look at the very end:
p187
aVwe've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent.
p188
aVBut we're excited in our company; we're motivated.
p189
aVWe really think it's a phenomenal driver of things,
p190
aVto force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually,
p191
aVworking with so many partners around the world,
p192
aVto be able to reach that goal.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, one of the things I'd like to explain [about] 50x15,
p195
aVwhich I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity.
p196
aVIt is actually a business venture.
p197
aVLet's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world,
p198
aVand call it the education market.
p199
aVWhen you look at elementary-school children,
p200
aVwe have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world
p201
aVthat could benefit tremendously
p202
aVfrom being able to be connected to the Internet.
p203
aVTherefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity
p204
aVto have a business that addresses the need of that segment.
p205
aVAnd when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning
p206
aVwe said it very clearly: this is not a charity.
p207
aVThis is really a business venture,
p208
aVone that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.
p209
aVBecause what we have learned in the last three years
p210
aVis that this segment of the market, whether it's education
p211
aVor under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands
p212
aVincredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability,
p213
aVtremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges
p214
aVthat frankly, without actually doing it,
p215
aVit would be very difficult to understand, and
p216
aVI'll explain that in just a minute.
p217
aa(lp218
VIt is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions.
p219
aVWhat we mean by that is,
p220
aVyou know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking
p221
aVmore or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed.
p222
aVIt is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.
p223
aVAnd frankly \u2014 and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers
p224
aVwhen I say this, but I truly mean it \u2014
p225
aVif you could take the name of the computer off the top of it,
p226
aVit would be very difficult to judge who made it,
p227
aVbecause they're all highly commoditized but they're all different.
p228
aVSo, there has not been a human-centric approach
p229
aVto addressing this segment of the market,
p230
aVso we really believe it is critical to think of it.
p231
aa(lp232
VIt reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this
p233
aVoperating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa.
p234
aVWe're talking about something very similar here.
p235
aVAnd it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach.
p236
aVWhat I mean by that is that in some parts of the world,
p237
aVthe government plays a key role in the development of technology.
p238
aVIn other parts, it doesn't.
p239
aVIn other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure
p240
aVthat allows for manufacturing to take place.
p241
aVIn other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive
p242
aVabout how this technology can be developed
p243
aVand put into action in those regions.
p244
aVAnd the last piece, which is really important \u2014
p245
aVand this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many,
p246
aVthis is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one \u2014
p247
aVis that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative
p248
aVcan come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems.
p249
aa(lp250
VWhat I mean by that, and let me use this example,
p251
aVthe country of South Africa, because I was just there,
p252
aVtherefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have.
p253
aVIt's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging.
p254
aVIt's beginning to grow tremendously.
p255
aVThey have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity.
p256
aVThey have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa.
p257
aVThey're developing a software-training environment in their universities.
p258
aVWhat a place, what an ideal place
p259
aVto create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software
p260
aVneeded for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa
p261
aVthey have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two \u2014
p262
aVEnglish and Afrikaans \u2014 but it turns out they have 18 dialects.
p263
aVAnd to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system,
p264
aVit could only be done from inside.
p265
aVI don't think this segment of the market can be addressed
p266
aVby companies parachuting from another place of the world,
p267
aVand just dumping product and selling into the markets.
p268
aVSo, we believe that in those regions of the world
p269
aVwhere the population is large,
p270
aVand there's an infrastructure that can provide it,
p271
aVthat a local, integrated, end-to-end system
p272
aVis really critical for its success.
p273
aa(lp274
VThis is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers
p275
aVin Mexico, in my home country.
p276
aVThis particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan.
p277
aVThose of you that might be familiar with Mexico \u2014
p278
aVMichoacan is a very colorful state.
p279
aVChildren dress with very colorful, colorful clothes,
p280
aVand it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids,
p281
aVin a computer. And I have to tell you that it's
p282
aVso easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology
p283
aVand connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids.
p284
aVWe just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school
p285
aVin the West Cape in South Africa,
p286
aVin a school that's called Nelson Mandela School,
p287
aVand when you see the faces and activities of these children
p288
aVbeing able to access computers, it's just phenomenal.
p289
aVAnd recently, they've written us letters,
p290
aVtelling us how excited they are about the impact
p291
aVthat this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams,
p292
aVon their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal.
p293
aa(lp294
VWe have now deployed 30 different technologists
p295
aVin 18 different countries, and we have been able
p296
aVto connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn
p297
aVwhat this particular segment of the market needs and demands.
p298
aVAnd I have to tell you that although
p299
aVmillions doesn't sound like a lot
p300
aVin terms of the billions that need to be connected,
p301
aVit's a start. And we are learning a lot.
p302
aVAnd we're learning a tremendous amount about
p303
aVwhat we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective.
p304
aa(lp305
VOne example of this has been the One Laptop per Child.
p306
aVSome of you are familiar with this.
p307
aVThis is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies \u2014
p308
aVGoogle is involved, Red Hat \u2014 and AMD is a key player.
p309
aVThe electronics behind the One Laptop per Child
p310
aVare based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor.
p311
aVBut to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be,
p312
aVone of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child
p313
aVis to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.
p314
aVBecause it was felt that a school day
p315
aVwould last at least eight hours, and
p316
aVyou wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop
p317
aVfor at least one full day without having to recharge it.
p318
aVThe engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part,
p319
aVand battery life on this product is now 15 hours \u2014
p320
aVjust through a lot of innovative work people have done
p321
aVbecause they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this.
p322
aVWe expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year,
p323
aVand we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer
p324
aVin the field of education.
p325
aVIt's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market,
p326
aVnot only in the developing countries, but actually
p327
aVin the developed regions as well, because
p328
aVthere are parts of the United States where this can have
p329
aValso a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient.
p330
aa(lp331
VWe also have partnered with TED
p332
aVin this project, with Architecture for Humanity,
p333
aVand along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair,
p334
aVwe're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community
p335
aVto come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region.
p336
aVAnd we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this,
p337
aVand can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity.
p338
aa(lp339
VLet me come back to the beginning,
p340
aVto end this presentation.
p341
aVI'll tell you that one of the things
p342
aVthat I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business,
p343
aVis to be able to be passionate about solving these problems.
p344
aVI don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet,
p345
aVand look at numbers and say, yes, that's a good business.
p346
aVI really believe that you have to have a passion for it.
p347
aa(lp348
VAnd one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents \u2014
p349
aVand I'll give you a little anecdote \u2014 especially from my father.
p350
aVAnd it took me a while to understand it,
p351
aVbut he said to me, when I went to college, he said,
p352
aV"You're the first person in the family to go to college.
p353
aVAnd it's really important you understand
p354
aVthat for civilization to make progress,
p355
aVeach generation has to do better than the last one.
p356
aVAnd therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation."
p357
aVFrankly, I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time.
p358
aVI was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study,
p359
aVand girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love.
p360
aVI graduated. I decided to get married.
p361
aVAnd on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, "You know,
p362
aVI'm going to remind you again, that each generation
p363
aVhas to do better than the last one.
p364
aVYou have to be a better husband than I was,
p365
aVbecause that's how you make progress." And now he began to make sense.
p366
aVBecause I knew what a great husband he was,
p367
aVand now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me,
p368
aVlike he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child,
p369
aVmy first child, and again, my father comes
p370
aVto the hospital, and we're looking at the glass,
p371
aVand see all the children on the other side, and he said,
p372
aV"I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better,
p373
aVyou're going to have to be a better father than I was."
p374
aVThat's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge
p375
aVthat he was placing on me, because he was a great father.
p376
aVBut the key is that he instilled in me a passion
p377
aVto really get up every day in the morning and want to do better,
p378
aVto really get up and think that my role in life
p379
aVis not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.
p380
aVIt's got to be that someday I can look back,
p381
aVand this place is truly better through some small contribution
p382
aVthat perhaps each of us could make.
p383
aVThank you very much.
p384
aV(Applause)

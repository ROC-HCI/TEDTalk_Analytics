VThe night before I was heading for Scotland,
p5
aVI was invited to host the final
p6
aVof "China's Got Talent" show in Shanghai
p7
aVwith the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.
p8
aVGuess who was the performing guest?
p9
aVSusan Boyle.
p10
aVAnd I told her, "I'm going to Scotland the next day."
p11
aVShe sang beautifully,
p12
aVand she even managed to say a few words in Chinese:
p13
aV\u9001\u4f60\u8471
p14
aVSo it's not like "hello" or "thank you,"
p15
aVthat ordinary stuff.
p16
aVIt means "green onion for free."
p17
aVWhy did she say that?
p18
aVBecause it was a line
p19
aVfrom our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle \u2014
p20
aVa 50-some year-old woman,
p21
aVa vegetable vendor in Shanghai,
p22
aVwho loves singing Western opera,
p23
aVbut she didn't understand
p24
aVany English or French or Italian,
p25
aVso she managed to fill in the lyrics
p26
aVwith vegetable names in Chinese.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVAnd the last sentence of Nessun Dorma
p29
aVthat she was singing in the stadium
p30
aVwas "green onion for free."
p31
aVSo [as] Susan Boyle was saying that,
p32
aV80,000 live audience sang together.
p33
aVThat was hilarious.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo I guess both Susan Boyle
p36
aVand this vegetable vendor in Shanghai
p37
aVbelonged to otherness.
p38
aVThey were the least expected to be successful
p39
aVin the business called entertainment,
p40
aVyet their courage and talent brought them through.
p41
aVAnd a show and a platform
p42
aVgave them the stage
p43
aVto realize their dreams.
p44
aVWell, being different is not that difficult.
p45
aVWe are all different
p46
aVfrom different perspectives.
p47
aVBut I think being different is good,
p48
aVbecause you present a different point of view.
p49
aVYou may have the chance to make a difference.
p50
aa(lp51
VMy generation has been very fortunate
p52
aVto witness and participate
p53
aVin the historic transformation of China
p54
aVthat has made so many changes
p55
aVin the past 20, 30 years.
p56
aVI remember that in the year of 1990,
p57
aVwhen I was graduating from college,
p58
aVI was applying for a job in the sales department
p59
aVof the first five-star hotel in Beijing,
p60
aVGreat Wall Sheraton \u2014 it's still there.
p61
aVSo after being interrogated
p62
aVby this Japanese manager for a half an hour,
p63
aVhe finally said,
p64
aV"So, Miss Yang,
p65
aVdo you have any questions to ask me?"
p66
aVI summoned my courage and poise and said,
p67
aV"Yes, but could you let me know,
p68
aVwhat actually do you sell?"
p69
aVI didn't have a clue what a sales department was about
p70
aVin a five-star hotel.
p71
aVThat was the first day I set my foot
p72
aVin a five-star hotel.
p73
aa(lp74
VAround the same time,
p75
aVI was going through an audition \u2014
p76
aVthe first ever open audition
p77
aVby national television in China \u2014
p78
aVwith another thousand college girls.
p79
aVThe producer told us
p80
aVthey were looking for some sweet, innocent
p81
aVand beautiful fresh face.
p82
aVSo when it was my turn, I stood up and said,
p83
aV"Why [do] women's personalities on television
p84
aValways have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent
p85
aVand, you know, supportive?
p86
aVWhy can't they have their own ideas
p87
aVand their own voice?"
p88
aVI thought I kind of offended them.
p89
aVBut actually, they were impressed by my words.
p90
aVAnd so I was in the second round of competition,
p91
aVand then the third and the fourth.
p92
aVAfter seven rounds of competition,
p93
aVI was the last one to survive it.
p94
aVSo I was on a national television prime-time show.
p95
aVAnd believe it or not,
p96
aVthat was the first show on Chinese television
p97
aVthat allowed its hosts
p98
aVto speak out of their own minds
p99
aVwithout reading an approved script.
p100
aV(Applause)
p101
aVAnd my weekly audience at that time
p102
aVwas between 200 to 300 million people.
p103
aa(lp104
VWell after a few years,
p105
aVI decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University
p106
aVto pursue my postgraduate studies,
p107
aVand then started my own media company,
p108
aVwhich was unthought of
p109
aVduring the years that I started my career.
p110
aVSo we do a lot of things.
p111
aVI've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past.
p112
aVAnd sometimes I have young people approaching me
p113
aVsay, "Lan, you changed my life,"
p114
aVand I feel proud of that.
p115
aVBut then we are also so fortunate
p116
aVto witness the transformation of the whole country.
p117
aVI was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games.
p118
aVI was representing the Shanghai Expo.
p119
aVI saw China embracing the world
p120
aVand vice versa.
p121
aVBut then sometimes I'm thinking,
p122
aVwhat are today's young generation up to?
p123
aVHow are they different,
p124
aVand what are the differences they are going to make
p125
aVto shape the future of China,
p126
aVor at large, the world?
p127
aa(lp128
VSo today I want to talk about young people
p129
aVthrough the platform of social media.
p130
aVFirst of all, who are they? [What] do they look like?
p131
aVWell this is a girl called Guo Meimei \u2014
p132
aV20 years old, beautiful.
p133
aVShe showed off her expensive bags,
p134
aVclothes and car
p135
aVon her microblog,
p136
aVwhich is the Chinese version of Twitter.
p137
aVAnd she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross
p138
aVat the Chamber of Commerce.
p139
aVShe didn't realize
p140
aVthat she stepped on a sensitive nerve
p141
aVand aroused national questioning,
p142
aValmost a turmoil,
p143
aVagainst the credibility of Red Cross.
p144
aVThe controversy was so heated
p145
aVthat the Red Cross had to open a press conference
p146
aVto clarify it,
p147
aVand the investigation is going on.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo far, as of today,
p150
aVwe know that she herself made up that title \u2014
p151
aVprobably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.
p152
aVAll those expensive items
p153
aVwere given to her as gifts
p154
aVby her boyfriend,
p155
aVwho used to be a board member
p156
aVin a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce.
p157
aVIt's very complicated to explain.
p158
aVBut anyway, the public still doesn't buy it.
p159
aVIt is still boiling.
p160
aVIt shows us a general mistrust
p161
aVof government or government-backed institutions,
p162
aVwhich lacked transparency in the past.
p163
aVAnd also it showed us
p164
aVthe power and the impact of social media
p165
aVas microblog.
p166
aa(lp167
VMicroblog boomed in the year of 2010,
p168
aVwith visitors doubled
p169
aVand time spent on it tripled.
p170
aVSina.com, a major news portal,
p171
aValone has more than 140 million microbloggers.
p172
aVOn Tencent, 200 million.
p173
aVThe most popular blogger \u2014
p174
aVit's not me \u2014
p175
aVit's a movie star,
p176
aVand she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans.
p177
aVAbout 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people,
p178
aVunder 30 years old.
p179
aVAnd because, as you know,
p180
aVthe traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government,
p181
aVsocial media offers an opening
p182
aVto let the steam out a little bit.
p183
aVBut because you don't have many other openings,
p184
aVthe heat coming out of this opening
p185
aVis sometimes very strong, active
p186
aVand even violent.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo through microblogging,
p189
aVwe are able to understand Chinese youth even better.
p190
aVSo how are they different?
p191
aVFirst of all, most of them were born
p192
aVin the 80s and 90s,
p193
aVunder the one-child policy.
p194
aVAnd because of selected abortion
p195
aVby families who favored boys to girls,
p196
aVnow we have ended up
p197
aVwith 30 million more young men than women.
p198
aVThat could pose
p199
aVa potential danger to the society,
p200
aVbut who knows;
p201
aVwe're in a globalized world,
p202
aVso they can look for girlfriends from other countries.
p203
aVMost of them have fairly good education.
p204
aVThe illiteracy rate in China among this generation
p205
aVis under one percent.
p206
aVIn cities, 80 percent of kids go to college.
p207
aVBut they are facing an aging China
p208
aVwith a population above 65 years old
p209
aVcoming up with seven-point-some percent this year,
p210
aVand about to be 15 percent
p211
aVby the year of 2030.
p212
aVAnd you know we have the tradition
p213
aVthat younger generations support the elders financially,
p214
aVand taking care of them when they're sick.
p215
aVSo it means young couples
p216
aVwill have to support four parents
p217
aVwho have a life expectancy of 73 years old.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo making a living is not that easy
p220
aVfor young people.
p221
aVCollege graduates are not in short supply.
p222
aVIn urban areas,
p223
aVcollege graduates find the starting salary
p224
aVis about 400 U.S. dollars a month,
p225
aVwhile the average rent
p226
aVis above $500.
p227
aVSo what do they do? They have to share space \u2014
p228
aVsqueezed in very limited space
p229
aVto save money \u2014
p230
aVand they call themselves "tribe of ants."
p231
aVAnd for those who are ready to get married
p232
aVand buy their apartment,
p233
aVthey figured out they have to work
p234
aVfor 30 to 40 years
p235
aVto afford their first apartment.
p236
aVThat ratio in America
p237
aVwould only cost a couple five years to earn,
p238
aVbut in China it's 30 to 40 years
p239
aVwith the skyrocketing real estate price.
p240
aa(lp241
VAmong the 200 million migrant workers,
p242
aV60 percent of them are young people.
p243
aVThey find themselves sort of sandwiched
p244
aVbetween the urban areas and the rural areas.
p245
aVMost of them don't want to go back to the countryside,
p246
aVbut they don't have the sense of belonging.
p247
aVThey work for longer hours
p248
aVwith less income, less social welfare.
p249
aVAnd they're more vulnerable
p250
aVto job losses,
p251
aVsubject to inflation,
p252
aVtightening loans from banks,
p253
aVappreciation of the renminbi,
p254
aVor decline of demand
p255
aVfrom Europe or America
p256
aVfor the products they produce.
p257
aVLast year, though,
p258
aVan appalling incident
p259
aVin a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China:
p260
aV13 young workers
p261
aVin their late teens and early 20s
p262
aVcommitted suicide,
p263
aVjust one by one like causing a contagious disease.
p264
aVBut they died because of all different personal reasons.
p265
aVBut this whole incident
p266
aVaroused a huge outcry from society
p267
aVabout the isolation,
p268
aVboth physical and mental,
p269
aVof these migrant workers.
p270
aa(lp271
VFor those who do return back to the countryside,
p272
aVthey find themselves very welcome locally,
p273
aVbecause with the knowledge, skills and networks
p274
aVthey have learned in the cities,
p275
aVwith the assistance of the Internet,
p276
aVthey're able to create more jobs,
p277
aVupgrade local agriculture and create new business
p278
aVin the less developed market.
p279
aVSo for the past few years, the coastal areas,
p280
aVthey found themselves in a shortage of labor.
p281
aa(lp282
VThese diagrams show
p283
aVa more general social background.
p284
aVThe first one is the Engels coefficient,
p285
aVwhich explains that the cost of daily necessities
p286
aVhas dropped its percentage
p287
aVall through the past decade,
p288
aVin terms of family income,
p289
aVto about 37-some percent.
p290
aVBut then in the last two years,
p291
aVit goes up again to 39 percent,
p292
aVindicating a rising living cost.
p293
aVThe Gini coefficient
p294
aVhas already passed the dangerous line of 0.4.
p295
aVNow it's 0.5 \u2014
p296
aVeven worse than that in America \u2014
p297
aVshowing us the income inequality.
p298
aVAnd so you see this whole society
p299
aVgetting frustrated
p300
aVabout losing some of its mobility.
p301
aVAnd also, the bitterness and even resentment
p302
aVtowards the rich and the powerful
p303
aVis quite widespread.
p304
aVSo any accusations of corruption
p305
aVor backdoor dealings between authorities or business
p306
aVwould arouse a social outcry
p307
aVor even unrest.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo through some of the hottest topics on microblogging,
p310
aVwe can see what young people care most about.
p311
aVSocial justice and government accountability
p312
aVruns the first in what they demand.
p313
aVFor the past decade or so,
p314
aVa massive urbanization and development
p315
aVhave let us witness a lot of reports
p316
aVon the forced demolition
p317
aVof private property.
p318
aVAnd it has aroused huge anger and frustration
p319
aVamong our young generation.
p320
aVSometimes people get killed,
p321
aVand sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest.
p322
aVSo when these incidents are reported
p323
aVmore and more frequently on the Internet,
p324
aVpeople cry for the government to take actions to stop this.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo the good news is that earlier this year,
p327
aVthe state council passed a new regulation
p328
aVon house requisition and demolition
p329
aVand passed the right
p330
aVto order forced demolition from local governments
p331
aVto the court.
p332
aVSimilarly, many other issues concerning public safety
p333
aVis a hot topic on the Internet.
p334
aVWe heard about polluted air,
p335
aVpolluted water, poisoned food.
p336
aVAnd guess what, we have faked beef.
p337
aVThey have sorts of ingredients
p338
aVthat you brush on a piece of chicken or fish,
p339
aVand it turns it to look like beef.
p340
aVAnd then lately,
p341
aVpeople are very concerned about cooking oil,
p342
aVbecause thousands of people have been found
p343
aV[refining] cooking oil
p344
aVfrom restaurant slop.
p345
aVSo all these things
p346
aVhave aroused a huge outcry from the Internet.
p347
aVAnd fortunately,
p348
aVwe have seen the government
p349
aVresponding more timely and also more frequently
p350
aVto the public concerns.
p351
aa(lp352
VWhile young people seem to be very sure
p353
aVabout their participation
p354
aVin public policy-making,
p355
aVbut sometimes they're a little bit lost
p356
aVin terms of what they want for their personal life.
p357
aVChina is soon to pass the U.S.
p358
aVas the number one market
p359
aVfor luxury brands \u2014
p360
aVthat's not including the Chinese expenditures
p361
aVin Europe and elsewhere.
p362
aVBut you know what, half of those consumers
p363
aVare earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars.
p364
aVThey're not rich at all.
p365
aVThey're taking those bags and clothes
p366
aVas a sense of identity and social status.
p367
aVAnd this is a girl explicitly saying
p368
aVon a TV dating show
p369
aVthat she would rather cry in a BMW
p370
aVthan smile on a bicycle.
p371
aVBut of course, we do have young people
p372
aVwho would still prefer to smile,
p373
aVwhether in a BMW or [on] a bicycle.
p374
aa(lp375
VSo in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon
p376
aVcalled "naked" wedding, or "naked" marriage.
p377
aVIt does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding,
p378
aVbut it shows that these young couples are ready to get married
p379
aVwithout a house, without a car, without a diamond ring
p380
aVand without a wedding banquet,
p381
aVto show their commitment to true love.
p382
aVAnd also, people are doing good through social media.
p383
aVAnd the first picture showed us
p384
aVthat a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs
p385
aVfor food processing
p386
aVwas spotted and stopped on the highway
p387
aVwith the whole country watching
p388
aVthrough microblogging.
p389
aVPeople were donating money, dog food
p390
aVand offering volunteer work to stop that truck.
p391
aVAnd after hours of negotiation,
p392
aV500 dogs were rescued.
p393
aVAnd here also people are helping to find missing children.
p394
aVA father posted his son's picture onto the Internet.
p395
aVAfter thousands of resends in relay,
p396
aVthe child was found,
p397
aVand we witnessed the reunion of the family
p398
aVthrough microblogging.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo happiness is the most popular word
p401
aVwe have heard through the past two years.
p402
aVHappiness is not only related
p403
aVto personal experiences and personal values,
p404
aVbut also, it's about the environment.
p405
aVPeople are thinking about the following questions:
p406
aVAre we going to sacrifice our environment further
p407
aVto produce higher GDP?
p408
aVHow are we going to perform our social and political reform
p409
aVto keep pace with economic growth,
p410
aVto keep sustainability and stability?
p411
aVAnd also, how capable is the system
p412
aVof self-correctness
p413
aVto keep more people content
p414
aVwith all sorts of friction going on at the same time?
p415
aVI guess these are the questions people are going to answer.
p416
aVAnd our younger generation
p417
aVare going to transform this country
p418
aVwhile at the same time being transformed themselves.
p419
aa(lp420
VThank you very much.

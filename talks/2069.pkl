VSo in 1781, an English composer,
p5
aVtechnologist and astronomer called William Herschel
p6
aVnoticed an object on the sky that
p7
aVdidn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did.
p8
aVAnd Herschel's recognition that something was different,
p9
aVthat something wasn't quite right,
p10
aVwas the discovery of a planet,
p11
aVthe planet Uranus,
p12
aVa name that has entertained
p13
aVcountless generations of children,
p14
aVbut a planet that overnight
p15
aVdoubled the size of our known solar system.
p16
aVJust last month, NASA announced the discovery
p17
aVof 517 new planets
p18
aVin orbit around nearby stars,
p19
aValmost doubling overnight the number of planets
p20
aVwe know about within our galaxy.
p21
aVSo astronomy is constantly being transformed by this
p22
aVcapacity to collect data,
p23
aVand with data almost doubling every year,
p24
aVwithin the next two decades, me may even
p25
aVreach the point for the first time in history
p26
aVwhere we've discovered the majority of the galaxies
p27
aVwithin the universe.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut as we enter this era of big data,
p30
aVwhat we're beginning to find is there's a difference
p31
aVbetween more data being just better
p32
aVand more data being different,
p33
aVcapable of changing the questions we want to ask,
p34
aVand this difference is not about how much data we collect,
p35
aVit's whether those data open new windows
p36
aVinto our universe,
p37
aVwhether they change the way we view the sky.
p38
aVSo what is the next window into our universe?
p39
aVWhat is the next chapter for astronomy?
p40
aVWell, I'm going to show you some of the tools and the technologies
p41
aVthat we're going to develop over the next decade,
p42
aVand how these technologies,
p43
aVtogether with the smart use of data,
p44
aVmay once again transform astronomy
p45
aVby opening up a window into our universe,
p46
aVthe window of time.
p47
aa(lp48
VWhy time? Well, time is about origins,
p49
aVand it's about evolution.
p50
aVThe origins of our solar system,
p51
aVhow our solar system came into being,
p52
aVis it unusual or special in any way?
p53
aVAbout the evolution of our universe.
p54
aVWhy our universe is continuing to expand,
p55
aVand what is this mysterious dark energy
p56
aVthat drives that expansion?
p57
aa(lp58
VBut first, I want to show you how technology
p59
aVis going to change the way we view the sky.
p60
aVSo imagine if you were sitting
p61
aVin the mountains of northern Chile
p62
aVlooking out to the west
p63
aVtowards the Pacific Ocean
p64
aVa few hours before sunrise.
p65
aVThis is the view of the night sky that you would see,
p66
aVand it's a beautiful view,
p67
aVwith the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon.
p68
aVbut it's also a static view,
p69
aVand in many ways, this is the way we think of our universe:
p70
aVeternal and unchanging.
p71
aVBut the universe is anything but static.
p72
aVIt constantly changes on timescales of seconds
p73
aVto billions of years.
p74
aVGalaxies merge, they collide
p75
aVat hundreds of thousands of miles per hour.
p76
aVStars are born, they die,
p77
aVthey explode in these extravagant displays.
p78
aVIn fact, if we could go back
p79
aVto our tranquil skies above Chile,
p80
aVand we allow time to move forward
p81
aVto see how the sky might change over the next year,
p82
aVthe pulsations that you see
p83
aVare supernovae, the final remnants of a dying star
p84
aVexploding, brightening and then fading from view,
p85
aVeach one of these supernovae
p86
aVfive billion times the brightness of our sun,
p87
aVso we can see them to great distances
p88
aVbut only for a short amount of time.
p89
aVTen supernova per second explode somewhere
p90
aVin our universe.
p91
aVIf we could hear it,
p92
aVit would be popping like a bag of popcorn.
p93
aVNow, if we fade out the supernovae,
p94
aVit's not just brightness that changes.
p95
aVOur sky is in constant motion.
p96
aVThis swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky
p97
aVare asteroids as they orbit our sun,
p98
aVand it's these changes and the motion
p99
aVand it's the dynamics of the system
p100
aVthat allow us to build our models for our universe,
p101
aVto predict its future and to explain its past.
p102
aa(lp103
VBut the telescopes we've used over the last decade
p104
aVare not designed to capture the data at this scale.
p105
aVThe Hubble Space Telescope:
p106
aVfor the last 25 years it's been producing
p107
aVsome of the most detailed views
p108
aVof our distant universe,
p109
aVbut if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image
p110
aVof the sky, it would take 13 million individual images,
p111
aVabout 120 years to do this just once.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo this is driving us to new technologies
p114
aVand new telescopes,
p115
aVtelescopes that can go faint
p116
aVto look at the distant universe
p117
aVbut also telescopes that can go wide
p118
aVto capture the sky as rapidly as possible,
p119
aVtelescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope,
p120
aVor the LSST,
p121
aVpossibly the most boring name ever
p122
aVfor one of the most fascinating experiments
p123
aVin the history of astronomy,
p124
aVin fact proof, if you should need it,
p125
aVthat you should never allow  a scientist or an engineer
p126
aVto name anything, not even your children. (Laughter)
p127
aVWe're building the LSST.
p128
aVWe expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade.
p129
aVI'm going to show you how we think
p130
aVit's going to transform  our views of the universe,
p131
aVbecause one image from the LSST
p132
aVis equivalent to 3,000 images
p133
aVfrom the Hubble Space Telescope,
p134
aVeach image three and a half degrees on the sky,
p135
aVseven times the width of the full moon.
p136
aVWell, how do you capture an image at this scale?
p137
aVWell, you build the largest digital camera in history,
p138
aVusing the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone
p139
aVor in the digital cameras you  can buy in the High Street,
p140
aVbut now at a scale that is five and a half feet across,
p141
aVabout the size of a Volkswagen Beetle,
p142
aVwhere one image is three billion pixels.
p143
aVSo if you wanted to look at an image
p144
aVin its full resolution, just a single LSST image,
p145
aVit would take about 1,500  high-definition TV screens.
p146
aVAnd this camera will image the sky,
p147
aVtaking a new picture every 20 seconds,
p148
aVconstantly scanning the sky
p149
aVso every three nights, we'll get a completely new view
p150
aVof the skies above Chile.
p151
aVOver the mission lifetime of this telescope,
p152
aVit will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies,
p153
aVand that will be for the first time
p154
aVwe'll have detected more objects in our universe
p155
aVthan people on the Earth.
p156
aVNow, we can talk about this
p157
aVin terms of terabytes and petabytes
p158
aVand billions of objects,
p159
aVbut a way to get a sense of the amount of data
p160
aVthat will come off this camera
p161
aVis that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded
p162
aVsimultaneously, 24 hours a day,
p163
aVseven days a week, for 10 years.
p164
aVAnd to process this data means
p165
aVsearching through all of those talks
p166
aVfor every new idea and every new concept,
p167
aVlooking at each part of the video
p168
aVto see how one frame may have changed
p169
aVfrom the next.
p170
aVAnd this is changing the way that we do science,
p171
aVchanging the way that we do astronomy,
p172
aVto a place where software and algorithms
p173
aVhave to mine through this data,
p174
aVwhere the software is as critical to the science
p175
aVas the telescopes and the  cameras that we've built.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, thousands of discoveries
p178
aVwill come from this project,
p179
aVbut I'm just going to tell you about two
p180
aVof the ideas about origins and evolution
p181
aVthat may be transformed by our access
p182
aVto data at this scale.
p183
aa(lp184
VIn the last five years, NASA has discovered
p185
aVover 1,000 planetary systems
p186
aVaround nearby stars,
p187
aVbut the systems we're finding
p188
aVaren't much like our own solar system,
p189
aVand one of the questions we face is
p190
aVis it just that we haven't been looking hard enough
p191
aVor is there something special or unusual
p192
aVabout how our solar system formed?
p193
aVAnd if we want to answer that question,
p194
aVwe have to know and understand
p195
aVthe history of our solar system in detail,
p196
aVand it's the details that are crucial.
p197
aVSo now, if we look back at the sky,
p198
aVat our asteroids that were streaming across the sky,
p199
aVthese asteroids are like the debris of our solar system.
p200
aVThe positions of the asteroids
p201
aVare like a fingerprint of an earlier time
p202
aVwhen the orbits of Neptune and Jupiter
p203
aVwere much closer to the sun,
p204
aVand as these giant planets migrated through our solar system,
p205
aVthey were scattering the asteroids in their wake.
p206
aVSo studying the asteroids
p207
aVis like performing forensics,
p208
aVperforming forensics on our solar system,
p209
aVbut to do this, we need distance,
p210
aVand we get the distance from the motion,
p211
aVand we get the motion because of our access to time.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo what does this tell us?
p214
aVWell, if you look at the little yellow asteroids
p215
aVflitting across the screen,
p216
aVthese are the asteroids that are moving fastest,
p217
aVbecause they're closest to us, closest to Earth.
p218
aVThese are the asteroids we may one day
p219
aVsend spacecraft to, to mine them for minerals,
p220
aVbut they're also the asteroids that may one day
p221
aVimpact the Earth,
p222
aVlike happened 60 million years ago
p223
aVwith the extinction of the dinosaurs,
p224
aVor just at the beginning of the last century,
p225
aVwhen an asteroid wiped out
p226
aValmost 1,000 square miles of Siberian forest,
p227
aVor even just last year, as one burnt up over Russia,
p228
aVreleasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb.
p229
aVSo studying the forensics of our solar system
p230
aVdoesn't just tell us about the past,
p231
aVit can also predict the future,  including our future.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow when we get distance,
p234
aVwe get to see the asteroids  in their natural habitat,
p235
aVin orbit around the sun.
p236
aVSo every point in this visualization that you can see
p237
aVis a real asteroid.
p238
aVIts orbit has been calculated from its motion across the sky.
p239
aVThe colors reflect the composition of these asteroids,
p240
aVdry and stony in the center,
p241
aVwater-rich and primitive towards the edge,
p242
aVwater-rich asteroids which may have seeded
p243
aVthe oceans and the seas that we find on our planet
p244
aVwhen they bombarded the  Earth at an earlier time.
p245
aVBecause the LSST will be able to go faint
p246
aVand not just wide,
p247
aVwe will be able to see these asteroids
p248
aVfar beyond the inner part of our solar system,
p249
aVto asteroids beyond the  orbits of Neptune and Mars,
p250
aVto comets and asteroids that may exist
p251
aValmost a light year from our sun.
p252
aVAnd as we increase the detail of this picture,
p253
aVincreasing the detail by factors of 10 to 100,
p254
aVwe will be able to answer questions such as,
p255
aVis there evidence for planets outside the orbit of Neptune,
p256
aVto find Earth-impacting asteroids
p257
aVlong before they're a danger,
p258
aVand to find out whether, maybe,
p259
aVour sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars,
p260
aVand maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings
p261
aVthat influenced the formation of our solar system,
p262
aVand maybe that's one of the reasons why  solar systems like ours seem to be so rare.
p263
aa(lp264
VNow, distance and changes in our universe \u2014
p265
aVdistance equates to time,
p266
aVas well as changes on the sky.
p267
aVEvery foot of distance you look away,
p268
aVor every foot of distance an object is away,
p269
aVyou're looking back about a billionth of a second in time,
p270
aVand this idea or this notion of looking back in time
p271
aVhas revolutionized our ideas about the universe,
p272
aVnot once but multiple times.
p273
aa(lp274
VThe first time was in 1929,
p275
aVwhen an astronomer called Edwin Hubble
p276
aVshowed that the universe was expanding,
p277
aVleading to the ideas of the Big Bang.
p278
aVAnd the observations were simple:
p279
aVjust 24 galaxies
p280
aVand a hand-drawn picture.
p281
aVBut just the idea that the more distant a galaxy,
p282
aVthe faster it was receding,
p283
aVwas enough to give rise to modern cosmology.
p284
aa(lp285
VA second revolution happened 70 years later,
p286
aVwhen two groups of astronomers showed
p287
aVthat the universe wasn't just expanding,
p288
aVit was accelerating,
p289
aVa surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky
p290
aVand finding out the higher that it gets,
p291
aVthe faster it moves away.
p292
aVAnd they showed this
p293
aVby measuring the brightness of supernovae,
p294
aVand how the brightness of the supernovae
p295
aVgot fainter with distance.
p296
aVAnd these observations were more complex.
p297
aVThey required new technologies and new telescopes,
p298
aVbecause the supernovae were in galaxies
p299
aVthat were 2,000 times more distant
p300
aVthan the ones used by Hubble.
p301
aVAnd it took three years to find just 42 supernovae,
p302
aVbecause a supernova only explodes
p303
aVonce every hundred years within a galaxy.
p304
aVThree years to find 42 supernovae
p305
aVby searching through tens of thousands of galaxies.
p306
aVAnd once they'd collected their data,
p307
aVthis is what they found.
p308
aVNow, this may not look impressive,
p309
aVbut this is what a revolution in physics looks like:
p310
aVa line predicting the brightness of a supernova
p311
aV11 billion light years away,
p312
aVand a handful of points that don't quite fit that line.
p313
aa(lp314
VSmall changes give rise to big consequences.
p315
aVSmall changes allow us to make discoveries,
p316
aVlike the planet found by Herschel.
p317
aVSmall changes turn our understanding
p318
aVof the universe on its head.
p319
aVSo 42 supernovae, slightly too faint,
p320
aVmeaning slightly further away,
p321
aVrequiring that a universe must not just be expanding,
p322
aVbut this expansion must be accelerating,
p323
aVrevealing a component of our universe
p324
aVwhich we now call dark energy,
p325
aVa component that drives this expansion
p326
aVand makes up 68 percent of the energy budget
p327
aVof our universe today.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo what is the next revolution likely to be?
p330
aVWell, what is dark energy and why does it exist?
p331
aVEach of these lines shows a different model
p332
aVfor what dark energy might be,
p333
aVshowing the properties of dark energy.
p334
aVThey all are consistent with the 42 points,
p335
aVbut the ideas behind these lines
p336
aVare dramatically different.
p337
aVSome people think about a dark energy
p338
aVthat changes with time,
p339
aVor whether the properties of the dark energy
p340
aVare different depending on where you look on the sky.
p341
aVOthers make differences and changes
p342
aVto the physics at the sub-atomic level.
p343
aVOr, they look at large scales
p344
aVand change how gravity and general relativity work,
p345
aVor they say our universe is just one of many,
p346
aVpart of this mysterious multiverse,
p347
aVbut all of these ideas, all of these theories,
p348
aVamazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy,
p349
aVbut all of them consistent with our 42 points.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo how can we hope to make sense of this
p352
aVover the next decade?
p353
aVWell, imagine if I gave you a pair of dice,
p354
aVand I said you wanted to see whether those dice
p355
aVwere loaded or fair.
p356
aVOne roll of the dice would tell you very little,
p357
aVbut the more times you rolled them,
p358
aVthe more data you collected,
p359
aVthe more confident you would become,
p360
aVnot just whether they're loaded or fair,
p361
aVbut by how much, and in what way.
p362
aVIt took three years to find just 42 supernovae
p363
aVbecause the telescopes that we built
p364
aVcould only survey a small part of the sky.
p365
aVWith the LSST, we get a completely new view
p366
aVof the skies above Chile every three nights.
p367
aVIn its first night of operation,
p368
aVit will find 10 times the number of supernovae
p369
aVused in the discovery of dark energy.
p370
aVThis will increase by 1,000
p371
aVwithin the first four months:
p372
aV1.5 million supernovae by the end of its survey,
p373
aVeach supernova a roll of the dice,
p374
aVeach supernova testing which theories of dark energy
p375
aVare consistent, and which ones are not.
p376
aVAnd so, by combining these supernova data
p377
aVwith other measures of cosmology,
p378
aVwe'll progressively rule out the different ideas
p379
aVand theories of dark energy
p380
aVuntil hopefully at the end of this survey around 2030,
p381
aVwe would expect to hopefully see
p382
aVa theory for our universe,
p383
aVa fundamental theory for the physics of our universe,
p384
aVto gradually emerge.
p385
aa(lp386
VNow, in many ways, the questions that I posed
p387
aVare in reality the simplest of questions.
p388
aVWe may not know the answers,
p389
aVbut we at least know how to ask the questions.
p390
aVBut if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies
p391
aVrevealed 42 supernovae that turned
p392
aVour understanding of the universe on its head,
p393
aVwhen we're working with billions of galaxies,
p394
aVhow many more times are we going to find
p395
aV42 points that don't quite match what we expect?
p396
aVLike the planet found by Herschel
p397
aVor dark energy
p398
aVor quantum mechanics or general relativity,
p399
aVall ideas that came because the data
p400
aVdidn't quite match what we expected.
p401
aVWhat's so exciting about the next decade of data
p402
aVin astronomy is,
p403
aVwe don't even know how many answers
p404
aVare out there waiting,
p405
aVanswers about our origins and our evolution.
p406
aVHow many answers are out there
p407
aVthat we don't even know the questions
p408
aVthat we want to ask?
p409
aa(lp410
VThank you.

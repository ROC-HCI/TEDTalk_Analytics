VI have a story, a story that I would like to share with you.
p5
aVAnd it's an African story.
p6
aVIt is a story of hope, resilience and glamour.
p7
aa(lp8
VThere was Hollywood.
p9
aVThen came Bollywood.
p10
aVToday we have Nollywood, the third-largest film industry in the world.
p11
aVIn 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.
p12
aVNow, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week
p13
aVin the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.
p14
aVSome estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.
p15
aVIt has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.
p16
aVAnd it's expanding.
p17
aVBut keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement.
p18
aVThis is something that happened without foreign investment,
p19
aVwithout government aid, and actually, it happened against all odds,
p20
aVin one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy.
p21
aVThe industry is 15 years old.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd so maybe you're thinking now,
p24
aVwhy, how, an Italian filmmaker based in Boston
p25
aVis so interested in this story?
p26
aVAnd so I think I have to tell you just a few words,
p27
aVa few things about my personal life,
p28
aVbecause I think there is a connection.
p29
aVMy grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia.
p30
aVMy father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa.
p31
aVAnd I was born in Zambia.
p32
aVEven though I left when I was only three years old,
p33
aVI really felt that Africa was this big part of my life.
p34
aVAnd it really was a place where I learned to walk.
p35
aVI think I uttered the first words,
p36
aVand my family bought their first home.
p37
aVSo when we came back to Italy,
p38
aVand one of the things that I remember the most
p39
aVis my family having this hard time to share stories.
p40
aVIt seemed that for our neighbors and friends,
p41
aVAfrica was either this exotic place, this imaginary land
p42
aVthat probably exists only in their imagination,
p43
aVor the place of horror, famine.
p44
aVAnd so we were always caught in this stereotype.
p45
aVAnd I remember really this desire to talk about Africa
p46
aVas a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives,
p47
aVand have dreams like we all have.
p48
aVSo when I read in a newspaper in the business page
p49
aVthe story of Nollywood,
p50
aVI really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story
p51
aVthat goes against all these preconceived notions.
p52
aa(lp53
VHere I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do,
p54
aVand actually I felt this was an inspiration for me.
p55
aVI have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence
p56
aVat the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.
p57
aVAnd we really look how digital technology is changing,
p58
aVand how young, independent filmmakers
p59
aVcan make movies at a fraction of the cost.
p60
aVSo when I proposed the story,
p61
aVI really had all the support to make this film.
p62
aVAnd not only had the support,
p63
aVI found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure.
p64
aVAimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer,
p65
aVand Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor,
p66
aVwho is a veteran of National Geographic,
p67
aVand told me, "You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa,
p68
aVI don't know if I have come across a story
p69
aVthat is so full of hope and so fun."
p70
aa(lp71
VSo we went to Lagos in October 2005.
p72
aVAnd we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa,
p73
aVa wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.
p74
aVThe plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood,
p75
aVof this incredible film industry,
p76
aVfollowing Bond in his quest to make an action movie
p77
aVthat deals with the issue of corruption,
p78
aVcalled "Checkpoint."
p79
aVPolice corruption.
p80
aVAnd he had nine days to make it.
p81
aVWe thought this was a good story.
p82
aa(lp83
VIn the meantime, we had to cover Nollywood,
p84
aVand we talked to a lot of filmmakers.
p85
aVBut I don't want to create too many expectations.
p86
aVI would like to show you six minutes.
p87
aVAnd these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience.
p88
aVThere are several themes from the documentary,
p89
aVbut they are re-edited and made for you, OK?
p90
aVSo I guess it's a world premier.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Video)
p93
aVMan: Action.
p94
aVMilverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here.
p95
aVAnd you shoot in seven days.
p96
aVPeace Piberesima: We're doing films for the masses.
p97
aVWe're not doing films for the elite
p98
aVand the people in their glass houses.
p99
aVThey can afford to watch their "Robocop" and whatever.
p100
aVMahmood Ali Balogun: I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those who work in it,
p101
aVis a kind of subsistence filmmaking \u2014 what they do to make a living.
p102
aVIt's not the fancy filmmaking where you say,
p103
aVoh, you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood,
p104
aVand where you have big budgets.
p105
aa(lp106
VHere is that you make these films,
p107
aVit sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film,
p108
aVbecause if you don't make the next film, you're not going to feed.
p109
aVBond Emeruwa: So while we're entertaining, we should be able to educate.
p110
aa(lp111
VI believe in the power of audiovisuals.
p112
aVI mean, 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood.
p113
aVI think it's the most viable vehicle right now
p114
aVto pass information across a dedicated cable.
p115
aVSo if you're making a movie, no matter what your topic is,
p116
aVput in a message in there.
p117
aVWoman: You still have to report the incident.
p118
aVHe needs proper medical attention.
p119
aVPP: I keep trying to explain to people,
p120
aVit's not about the quality at the moment \u2014 the quality is coming.
p121
aVI mean, there are those films that people are making for quality,
p122
aVbut the first thing you have to remember about this society
p123
aVis that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day,
p124
aVand these are the people that really watch these films.
p125
aa(lp126
VSonny McDon W: Nollywood is a fantastic industry
p127
aVthat has just been born in this part of the world.
p128
aVBecause nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa.
p129
aVLancelot Imasen: But our films,
p130
aVthey are stories that our people can relate to themselves.
p131
aVThey are stories about our people, for our people.
p132
aVAnd consistently, they are glued to their screen
p133
aVwhenever they see the story.
p134
aVNarrator: Suspense, fun and intrigue.
p135
aVIt's the blockbuster comedy.
p136
aVYou'll crack your ribs.
p137
aa(lp138
VBernard Pinayon Agbaosi: We have been so deep into the foreign movies.
p139
aVIt's all about the foreign movies.
p140
aVBut we can do something too.
p141
aVWe can do something, something that when the world sees it,
p142
aVthey say, wow, this is Nigeria.
p143
aVMan: Just arrest yourself, sergeant.
p144
aVDon't embarrass yourself.
p145
aVCome on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back.
p146
aa(lp147
VSMW: You can now walk the street and see a role model.
p148
aVIt\u2019s not just what you see in picture.
p149
aVYou see the person live.
p150
aVYou see how he talks. You see how he lives.
p151
aVHe influences you really good, you know.
p152
aVIt\u2019s not just what you see in the picture.
p153
aVIt is not what you hear, you know, from the Western press.
p154
aVMan: See you. Bye.
p155
aVAction.
p156
aa(lp157
VSaint Obi: I was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies.
p158
aVBut then when I discovered the situation in my country,
p159
aVat that time there was so much corruption.
p160
aVFor a young man to really make it out here,
p161
aVyou got to think of some negative things and all that,
p162
aVor some kind of vices.
p163
aVAnd I didn't want that, you know.
p164
aVAnd I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor,
p165
aVwithout doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling no lies.
p166
aVJust me and God-given talent.
p167
aVMan: Let's go.
p168
aVOK, it's time to kick some ass.
p169
aVCover this. It's your own.
p170
aVMove it.
p171
aa(lp172
VRoboger Animadu: In big countries, when they do the movies,
p173
aVthey have all these things in place.
p174
aVBut here, we improvise these items, like the gunshots.
p175
aVLike they go, here, now, now, you see the gun there,
p176
aVbut you won't see any guns shot, we use knock-out.
p177
aVKevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face.
p178
aVWoman: That's why I use enough masking tape.
p179
aVThe masking tape will hold it.
p180
aVWat, wait. Just hold this for me.
p181
aVKBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well
p182
aVso that it won't affect my face \u2014 the explosion, you know.
p183
aVBut she's a professional. She knows what she\u2019s doing.
p184
aVI'm trying to protect my face too.
p185
aVThis ain't going to be my last movie.
p186
aVYou know, this is Nollywood, where the magic lives.
p187
aa(lp188
VRA: So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here,
p189
aVwith or without any assistance from anybody.
p190
aVMan: Action.
p191
aVCut.
p192
aV(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VFranco Sacchi: So many things to say, so little time.
p195
aVSo many themes in this story.
p196
aVI just can't tell you \u2014 there\u2019s one thing I want to tell you.
p197
aVI spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers,
p198
aVand the problems they have to go through are unimaginable
p199
aVfor, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe.
p200
aVBut always with a smile, always with an enthusiasm,
p201
aVthat is incredible.
p202
aa(lp203
VWerner Herzog, the German filmmaker said,
p204
aV"I need to make movies like you need oxygen."
p205
aVAnd I think they\u2019re breathing.
p206
aVThe Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like.
p207
aVAnd so it's a very, very important thing for them,
p208
aVand for their audiences.
p209
aVA woman told me, "When I see a Nollywood film,
p210
aVI can relax, I really \u2014 I can breathe better."
p211
aa(lp212
VThere is also another very important thing
p213
aVthat I hope will resonate with this audience.
p214
aVIt\u2019s technology. I\u2019m very interested in it
p215
aVand I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know,
p216
aVthe cost now is a fraction of what it used to be.
p217
aVIncredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars.
p218
aVAnd this has unleashed tremendous energy.
p219
aVAnd guess what?
p220
aVWe didn\u2019t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers.
p221
aVThey understood it, they embraced the technology
p222
aVand they run with it, and they\u2019re successful.
p223
aVI hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.
p224
aVI hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology,
p225
aVlook at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs,
p226
aVcreate a narrative for the population, something to identify,
p227
aVsomething positive, something that really is psychological relief
p228
aVand it's part of the culture.
p229
aVBut I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us.
p230
aVI really think it goes both ways.
p231
aa(lp232
VFilmmakers, friends of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say,
p233
aV"Wow, they are doing what we really want to do,
p234
aVand make a buck and live with this job."
p235
aVSo I really think it\u2019s a lesson
p236
aVthat we're actually learning from them.
p237
aVAnd there's one thing, one small challenge that I have for you,
p238
aVand should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling.
p239
aVAnd I think this is really the theme of this session.
p240
aVTry to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter, but no stories.
p241
aVNo stories around the campfire.
p242
aVNo legends, no fairytales.
p243
aVNothing.
p244
aVNo novels.
p245
aVDifficult, eh? It's meaningless.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo this is what I really think.
p248
aVI think that the key to a healthy society
p249
aVis a thriving community of storytellers,
p250
aVand I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this.
p251
aVI would like you to hear their voices.
p252
aVJust a few moments.
p253
aVIt\u2019s not an added sequence, just some voices from Nollywood.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Video) Toyin Alousa: Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them.
p256
aVIf you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face,
p257
aVthat\u2019s Nollywood.
p258
aVSO: I believe very soon, we\u2019re not only going to have better movies,
p259
aVwe'll have that original Nigerian movie.
p260
aVBE: It\u2019s still the same basic themes.
p261
aVLove, action.
p262
aVBut we're telling it our own way, our own Nigerian way, African way.
p263
aVWe have diverse cultures, diverse cultures, there are so many,
p264
aVthat in the natal lifetimes,
p265
aVI don't see us exhausting the stories we have.
p266
aa(lp267
VFS: My job ends here, and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work.
p268
aVAnd I really hope that there will be many, many collaborations,
p269
aVwhere we teach each other things.
p270
aVAnd I really hope that this will happen.
p271
aVThank you very much.
p272
aV(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VChris Anderson: Stop. I've got two questions.
p275
aVFranco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry.
p276
aVWhat does that translate to in terms of numbers of films, really?
p277
aa(lp278
VFS: Oh, yes. I think I mentioned briefly \u2014 it's close to 2,000 films.
p279
aVThere is scientific data on this.
p280
aa(lp281
VCA: 2,000 films a year?
p282
aVFS: 2,000 films a year. 2005 or 6,
p283
aVthe censor board has censored 1,600 films alone.
p284
aVAnd we know that there are more.
p285
aVSo it\u2019s safe to say that there are 2,000 films.
p286
aVSo imagine 45 films per week.
p287
aVThere are challenges. There are challenges.
p288
aVThere is a glut of film,
p289
aVthe quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level,
p290
aVbut I\u2019m optimistic.
p291
aa(lp292
VCA: And these aren\u2019t films that are primarily seen in cinemas?
p293
aa(lp294
VFS: Oh yes, of course. This is very important.
p295
aVMaybe, you know, for you to try to imagine this,
p296
aVthese are films that are distributed directly in markets.
p297
aVThey are bought in video shops.
p298
aVThey can be rented for pennies.
p299
aa(lp300
VCA: On what format?
p301
aa(lp302
VFS: Oh, the format \u2014 thank you for the question. Yes, it's VCDs.
p303
aVIt's a CD, it's a little bit more compressed image.
p304
aVThey started with VHS.
p305
aVThey actually didn't wait for, you know, the latest technology.
p306
aVThey started in '92, '94.
p307
aVSo there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria
p308
aVthat play, you know, VHS and these VCDs.
p309
aVIt's a CD basically. It's a compact disc.
p310
aa(lp311
VCA: So on the streets, are film casts ... ?
p312
aa(lp313
VFS: You can be in a Lagos traffic jam
p314
aVand you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes.
p315
aV(Laughter)
p316
aVAnd I have to say, this really proves that storytelling,
p317
aVit's a commodity, it's a staple.
p318
aVThere is no life without stories.
p319
aa(lp320
VCA: Franco, thank you so much.

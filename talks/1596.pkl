VHaving spent 18 years as a child of the state
p5
aVin children's homes and foster care,
p6
aVyou could say that I'm an expert on the subject,
p7
aVand in being an expert, I want to let you know that
p8
aVbeing an expert does in no way make you right
p9
aVin light of the truth.
p10
aa(lp11
VIf you're in care, legally the government is your
p12
aVparent, loco parentis.
p13
aVMargaret Thatcher was my mother. (Laughter)
p14
aVLet's not talk about breastfeeding. (Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VHarry Potter was a foster child.
p17
aVPip from "Great Expectations" was adopted;
p18
aVSuperman was a foster child;
p19
aVCinderella was a foster child;
p20
aVLisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo,
p21
aVwas fostered and institutionalized;
p22
aVBatman was orphaned;
p23
aVLyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's "Northern Lights"
p24
aVwas fostered;
p25
aVJane Eyre, adopted;
p26
aVRoald Dahl's James from "James and the Giant Peach;"
p27
aVMatilda; Moses \u2014 Moses! (Laughter)
p28
aVMoses! (Laughter) \u2014
p29
aVthe boys in Michael Morpurgo's "Friend or Foe;"
p30
aVAlem in Benjamin Zephaniah's "Refugee Boy;"
p31
aVLuke Skywalker \u2014
p32
aVLuke Skywalker! (Laughter) \u2014
p33
aVOliver Twist;
p34
aVCassia in "The Concubine of Shanghai" by Hong Ying;
p35
aVCelie in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple."
p36
aVAll of these great fictional characters, all of them
p37
aVwho were hurt by their condition,
p38
aVall of them who spawned thousands of other books
p39
aVand other films, all of them
p40
aVwere fostered, adopted or orphaned.
p41
aVIt seems that writers know that the child
p42
aVoutside of family reflects on what family truly is
p43
aVmore than what it promotes itself to be.
p44
aVThat is, they also use extraordinary skills
p45
aVto deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis.
p46
aa(lp47
VHow have we not made the connection?
p48
aVAnd why have we not made the connection, between
p49
aV\u2014 How has that happened? \u2014
p50
aVbetween these incredible characters of popular culture
p51
aVand religions, and the fostered, adopted or orphaned child
p52
aVin our midst? It's not our pity that they need.
p53
aVIt's our respect.
p54
aVI know famous musicians,
p55
aVI know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists
p56
aVand top lawyers and television executives
p57
aVand magazine editors and national journalists
p58
aVand dustbinmen and hairdressers, all who were
p59
aVlooked after children, fostered, adopted or orphaned,
p60
aVand many of them grow into their adult lives
p61
aVin fear of speaking of their background, as if it may
p62
aVsomehow weaken their standing in the foreground,
p63
aVas if it were somehow Kryptonite, as if it were a time bomb
p64
aVstrapped on the inside. Children in care,
p65
aVwho've had a life in care, deserve the right
p66
aVto own and live the memory of their own childhood.
p67
aVIt is that simple.
p68
aa(lp69
VMy own mother \u2014 and I should say this here \u2014
p70
aVshe same to this country in the late '60s,
p71
aVand she was, you know, she found herself pregnant,
p72
aVas women did in the late '60s. You know what I mean?
p73
aVThey found themselves pregnant.
p74
aVAnd she sort of, she had no idea of the context
p75
aVin which she'd landed.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn the 1960s \u2014 I should give you some context \u2014 in the 1960s,
p78
aVif you were pregnant and you were single,
p79
aVyou were seen as a threat to the community.
p80
aVYou were separated from your family by the state.
p81
aVYou were separated from your family and placed into
p82
aVmother and baby homes.
p83
aVYou were appointed a social worker.
p84
aVThe adoptive parents were lined up.
p85
aVIt was the primary purpose of the social worker, the aim,
p86
aVto get the woman at her most vulnerable time
p87
aVin her entire life, to sign the adoption papers.
p88
aVSo the adoption papers were signed.
p89
aVThe mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns.
p90
aVThe adoption papers were signed,
p91
aVthe child was given to the adoptive parents, and the mother
p92
aVshipped back to her community
p93
aVto say that she'd been on a little break.
p94
aVA little break.
p95
aVA little break.
p96
aVThe first secret of shame for a woman
p97
aVfor being a woman, "a little break."
p98
aVThe adoption process took, like, a matter of months,
p99
aVso it was a closed shop, you know, sealed deal,
p100
aVan industrious, utilitarian solution:
p101
aVthe government, the farmer,
p102
aVthe adopting parents, the consumer,
p103
aVthe mother, the earth, and the child, the crop.
p104
aa(lp105
VIt's kind of easy to patronize the past,
p106
aVto forego our responsibilities in the present.
p107
aVWhat happened then is a direct reflection
p108
aVof what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves
p109
aVto be doing the right thing by God and by the state
p110
aVfor the big society, fast-tracking adoption.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo anyway, she comes here, 1967, she's pregnant,
p113
aVand she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating
p114
aVits own jubilee at the time
p115
aVunder the Emperor Haile Selassie,
p116
aVand she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech,
p117
aVthe "Rivers of Blood" speech.
p118
aVShe lands months before the Beatles release "The White Album,"
p119
aVmonths before Martin Luther King was killed.
p120
aVIt was a summer of love if you were white.
p121
aVIf you were black, it was a summer of hate.
p122
aVSo she goes from Oxford, she's sent to the north of England
p123
aVto a mother and baby home, and appointed a social worker.
p124
aVIt's her plan. You know, I have to say this in the Houses \u2014
p125
aVIt's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time
p126
aVwhile she studies. But the social worker,
p127
aVhe had a different agenda.
p128
aVHe found the foster parents, and he said to them,
p129
aV"Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever.
p130
aVHis name is Norman." (Laughter)
p131
aVNorman! (Laughter)
p132
aVNorman!
p133
aa(lp134
VSo they took me. I was a message, they said.
p135
aVI was a sign from God, they said.
p136
aVI was Norman Mark Greenwood.
p137
aVNow, for the next 11 years, all I know is that this woman,
p138
aVthis birth woman, should have her eyes scratched out
p139
aVfor not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman
p140
aVtoo selfish to sign, so I spent those 11 years
p141
aVkneeling and praying.
p142
aVI tried praying. I swear I tried praying.
p143
aV"God, can I have a bike for Christmas?"
p144
aVBut I would always answer myself, "Yes, of course you can."
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVAnd then I was supposed to determine whether that
p147
aVwas the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil.
p148
aVAnd it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me.
p149
aVWho knew? (Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VSo anyway, two years sort of passed,
p152
aVand they had a child of their own,
p153
aVand then another two years passed, and they had another child of their own,
p154
aVand then another time passed
p155
aVand they had another child that they called an accident,
p156
aVwhich I thought was an unusual name. (Laughter)
p157
aVAnd I was on the cusp of, sort of, adolescence,
p158
aVso I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking.
p159
aVI was starting to stay out a little bit late, etc., etc.
p160
aVNow, in their religiosity, in their naivete,
p161
aVmy mom and dad, which I believed them to be forever,
p162
aVas they said they were, my mom and dad
p163
aVconceived that I had the Devil inside of me.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd what \u2014 I should say this here, because this is how
p166
aVthey engineered my leaving.
p167
aVThey sat me at a table, my foster mom, and she said to me,
p168
aV"You don't love us, do you?" At 11 years old.
p169
aVThey've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd I said, "Yeah, of course I do." Because you do.
p172
aa(lp173
VMy foster mother asked me to go away to think about love
p174
aVand what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow
p175
aVand give my most honest and truthful answer.
p176
aVSo this was an opportunity. If they were asking me
p177
aVwhether I loved them or not, then I mustn't love them,
p178
aVwhich led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.
p179
aV"I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine
p180
aVthrough me to them. How fantastic." This was an opportunity.
p181
aVThe theology was perfect, the timing unquestionable,
p182
aVand the answer as honest as a sinner could get.
p183
aa(lp184
V"I mustn't love you," I said to them. "But I will ask God for forgiveness."
p185
aa(lp186
V"Because you don't love us, Norman,
p187
aVclearly you've chosen your path."
p188
aa(lp189
VTwenty-four hours later, my social worker,
p190
aVthis strange man who used to visit me every couple of months,
p191
aVhe's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents.
p192
aVI didn't say goodbye to anybody, not my mother, my father,
p193
aVmy sisters, my brothers, my aunts, my uncles,
p194
aVmy cousins, my grandparents, nobody.
p195
aVOn the way to the children's home, I started to ask myself,
p196
aV"What's happened to me?"
p197
aVIt's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me
p198
aVas much as the entire floor had been taken away.
p199
aa(lp200
VWhen I got to the \u2014
p201
aVFor the next four, five years,
p202
aVI was held in four different children's homes.
p203
aVOn the third children's home, at 15,
p204
aVI started to rebel, and what I did was,
p205
aVI got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models,
p206
aVand I was \u2014 it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home \u2014
p207
aVand I was in a little turret at the top of it,
p208
aVand I poured them, red, yellow and green,
p209
aVthe colors of Africa, down the tiles.
p210
aVYou couldn't see it from the street, because the home
p211
aVwas surrounded by beech trees.
p212
aa(lp213
VFor doing this, I was incarcerated for a year
p214
aVin an assessment center which was actually
p215
aVa remand center. It was a virtual prison
p216
aVfor young people.
p217
aa(lp218
VBy the way, years later, my social worker said
p219
aVthat I should never have been put in there.
p220
aVI wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong.
p221
aVBut because I had no family to inquire about me,
p222
aVthey could do anything to me.
p223
aa(lp224
VI'm 17 years old, and
p225
aVthey had a padded cell.
p226
aVThey would march me down corridors in last-size order.
p227
aVThey \u2014 I was put in a dormitory
p228
aVwith a confirmed Nazi sympathizer.
p229
aVAll of the staff were ex-police \u2014 interesting \u2014
p230
aVand ex-probation officers.
p231
aVThe man who ran it was an ex-army officer.
p232
aVEvery time I had a visit by a person who I did not know
p233
aVwho would feed me grapes, once every three months,
p234
aVI was strip-searched.
p235
aVThat home was full of young boys who were on remand
p236
aVfor things like murder.
p237
aVAnd this was the preparation that I was being given
p238
aVafter 17 years as a child of the state.
p239
aa(lp240
VI have to tell this story.
p241
aVI have to tell it, because there was no one
p242
aVto put two and two together.
p243
aa(lp244
VI slowly became aware that I knew nobody
p245
aVthat knew me for longer than a year.
p246
aVSee, that's what family does.
p247
aVIt gives you reference points.
p248
aVI'm not defining a good family from a bad family.
p249
aVI'm just saying that you know when your birthday is
p250
aVby virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is,
p251
aVa mother, a father, a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle,
p252
aVa cousin, a grandparent. It matters to someone,
p253
aVand therefore it matters to you. Understand,
p254
aVI was 14 years old, tucked away in myself, into myself,
p255
aVand I wasn't touched either, physically touched.
p256
aa(lp257
VI'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that
p258
aVwhen I left the children's home I had two things
p259
aVthat I wanted to do. One was to find my family,
p260
aVand the other was to write poetry.
p261
aVIn creativity I saw light.
p262
aVIn the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life,
p263
aVthe endless truth, the permanent creation of reality,
p264
aVthe place where anger was an expression
p265
aVin the search for love, a place where dysfunction
p266
aVis a true reaction to untruth.
p267
aa(lp268
VI've just got to say it to you all: I found all of my family
p269
aVin my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them,
p270
aVand I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else.
p271
aa(lp272
VBut I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply
p273
aVthat you can define how strong a democracy is
p274
aVby how its government treats its child.
p275
aVI don't mean children. I mean the child of the state.
p276
aVThanks very much. It's been an honor. (Applause)
p277
aV(Applause)

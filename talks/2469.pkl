VPeople returning to work after a career break:
p5
aVI call them relaunchers.
p6
aVThese are people who have taken career breaks for elder care,
p7
aVfor childcare reasons,
p8
aVpursuing a personal interest
p9
aVor a personal health issue.
p10
aVClosely related are career transitioners of all kinds:
p11
aVveterans, military spouses,
p12
aVretirees coming out of retirement
p13
aVor repatriating expats.
p14
aVReturning to work after a career break is hard
p15
aVbecause of a disconnect between the employers
p16
aVand the relaunchers.
p17
aVEmployers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume
p18
aVas a high-risk proposition,
p19
aVand individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities
p20
aVto relaunch their careers,
p21
aVespecially if they've been out for a long time.
p22
aVThis disconnect is a problem that I'm trying to help solve.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field.
p25
aVThis is Sami Kafala.
p26
aVHe's a nuclear physicist in the UK
p27
aVwho took a five-year career break to be home with his five children.
p28
aVThe Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work
p29
aVafter long career breaks.
p30
aVAnd speaking of long career breaks,
p31
aVthis is Mimi Kahn.
p32
aVShe's a social worker in Orange County, California,
p33
aVwho returned to work in a social services organization
p34
aVafter a 25-year career break.
p35
aVThat's the longest career break that I'm aware of.
p36
aVSupreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
p37
aVtook a five-year career break early in her career.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd this is Tracy Shapiro, who took a 13-year career break.
p40
aVTracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show
p41
aVfrom people who were trying to return to work
p42
aVbut having a difficult time of it.
p43
aVTracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home,
p44
aVbut she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work,
p45
aVplus she really wanted to bring work back into her life
p46
aVbecause she loved working.
p47
aVTracy was doing what so many of us do
p48
aVwhen we feel like we've put in a good day in the job search.
p49
aVShe was looking for a finance or accounting role,
p50
aVand she had just spent the last nine months
p51
aVvery diligently researching companies online
p52
aVand applying for jobs with no results.
p53
aa(lp54
VI met Tracy in June of 2011,
p55
aVwhen the Today Show asked me if I could work with her
p56
aVto see if I could help her turn things around.
p57
aVThe first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house.
p58
aVI told her she had to go public with her job search
p59
aVand tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work.
p60
aVI also told her, "You are going to have a lot of conversations
p61
aVthat don't go anywhere.
p62
aVExpect that, and don't be discouraged by it.
p63
aVThere will be a handful
p64
aVthat ultimately lead to a job opportunity."
p65
aa(lp66
VI'll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit,
p67
aVbut I want to share with you a discovery that I made
p68
aVwhen I was returning to work
p69
aVafter my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce.
p70
aVAnd that is, that people's view of you is frozen in time.
p71
aVWhat I mean by this is, when you start to get in touch with people
p72
aVand you get back in touch with those people from the past,
p73
aVthe people with whom you worked or went to school,
p74
aVthey are going to remember you as you were
p75
aVbefore your career break.
p76
aVAnd that's even if your sense of self has diminished over time,
p77
aVas happens with so many of us
p78
aVthe farther removed we are from our professional identities.
p79
aVSo for example, you might think of yourself
p80
aVas someone who looks like this.
p81
aVThis is me, crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan.
p82
aVOr here I am in the kitchen.
p83
aVBut those people from the past,
p84
aVthey don't know about any of this.
p85
aVThey only remember you as you were,
p86
aVand it's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people
p87
aVand hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work.
p88
aa(lp89
VThere's one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break.
p90
aVAnd that was that I hardly kept up with the business news.
p91
aVMy background is in finance,
p92
aVand I hardly kept up with any news
p93
aVwhen I was home caring for my four young children.
p94
aVSo I was afraid I'd go into an interview
p95
aVand start talking about a company that didn't exist anymore.
p96
aVSo I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal
p97
aVand read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt
p98
aVlike I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again.
p99
aa(lp100
VI believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce,
p101
aVand here's why.
p102
aVThink about our life stage:
p103
aVfor those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons,
p104
aVwe have fewer or no maternity leaves.
p105
aVWe did that already.
p106
aVWe have fewer spousal or partner job relocations.
p107
aVWe're in a more settled time of life.
p108
aVWe have great work experience.
p109
aVWe have a more mature perspective.
p110
aVWe're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense.
p111
aVPlus we have an energy, an enthusiasm about returning to work
p112
aVprecisely because we've been away from it for a while.
p113
aa(lp114
VOn the flip side, I speak with employers,
p115
aVand here are two concerns that employers have
p116
aVabout hiring relaunchers.
p117
aa(lp118
VThe first one is, employers are worried that relaunchers
p119
aVare technologically obsolete.
p120
aVNow, I can tell you,
p121
aVhaving been technologically obsolete myself at one point,
p122
aVthat it's a temporary condition.
p123
aVI had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.
p124
aVI don't know if anyone can even remember back that far,
p125
aVbut I had to relearn it on Excel.
p126
aVIt actually wasn't that hard. A lot of the commands are the same.
p127
aVI found PowerPoint much more challenging,
p128
aVbut now I use PowerPoint all the time.
p129
aVI tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table
p130
aVwith a working knowledge of basic office management software.
p131
aVAnd if they're not up to speed,
p132
aVthen it's their responsibility to get there.
p133
aVAnd they do.
p134
aa(lp135
VThe second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers
p136
aVis they're worried that relaunchers don't know what they want to do.
p137
aVI tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work
p138
aVto figure out whether their interests and skills have changed
p139
aVor have not changed
p140
aVwhile they have been on career break.
p141
aVThat's not the employer's job.
p142
aVIt's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer
p143
aVwhere they can add the most value.
p144
aa(lp145
VBack in 2010 I started noticing something.
p146
aVI had been tracking return to work programs since 2008,
p147
aVand in 2010, I started noticing
p148
aVthe use of a short-term paid work opportunity,
p149
aVwhether it was called an internship or not,
p150
aVbut an internship-like experience,
p151
aVas a way for professionals to return to work.
p152
aVI saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee
p153
aVstart corporate reentry internship programs.
p154
aVI saw a returning engineer, a nontraditional reentry candidate,
p155
aVapply for an entry-level internship program in the military,
p156
aVand then get a permanent job afterward.
p157
aVI saw two universities integrate internships
p158
aVinto mid-career executive education programs.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo I wrote a report about what I was seeing,
p161
aVand it became this article for Harvard Business Review
p162
aVcalled "The 40-Year-Old Intern."
p163
aVI have to thank the editors there for that title,
p164
aVand also for this artwork
p165
aVwhere you can see the 40-year-old intern in the midst of all the college interns.
p166
aVAnd then, courtesy of Fox Business News,
p167
aVthey called the concept "The 50-Year-Old Intern."
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VSo five of the biggest financial services companies
p172
aVhave reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals.
p173
aVAnd at this point, hundreds of people have participated.
p174
aVThese internships are paid,
p175
aVand the people who move on to permanent roles
p176
aVare commanding competitive salaries.
p177
aVAnd now, seven of the biggest engineering companies
p178
aVare piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers
p179
aVas part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers.
p180
aVNow, why are companies embracing the reentry internship?
p181
aVBecause the internship allows the employer
p182
aVto base their hiring decision on an actual work sample
p183
aVinstead of a series of interviews,
p184
aVand the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision
p185
aVuntil the internship period is over.
p186
aVThis testing out period removes the perceived risk
p187
aVthat some managers attach to hiring relaunchers,
p188
aVand they are attracting excellent candidates
p189
aVwho are turning into great hires.
p190
aa(lp191
VThink about how far we have come.
p192
aVBefore this, most employers were not interested
p193
aVin engaging with relaunchers at all.
p194
aVBut now, not only are programs being developed
p195
aVspecifically with relaunchers in mind,
p196
aVbut you can't even apply for these programs
p197
aVunless you have a gap on your résumé.
p198
aa(lp199
VThis is the mark of real change,
p200
aVof true institutional shift,
p201
aVbecause if we can solve this problem for relaunchers,
p202
aVwe can solve it for other career transitioners too.
p203
aVIn fact, an employer just told me
p204
aVthat their veterans return to work program
p205
aVis based on their reentry internship program.
p206
aVAnd there's no reason why there can't be a retiree internship program.
p207
aVDifferent pool, same concept.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro.
p210
aVRemember that she had to tell everyone she knew
p211
aVabout her interest in returning to work.
p212
aVWell, one critical conversation with another parent in her community
p213
aVled to a job offer for Tracy,
p214
aVand it was an accounting job in a finance department.
p215
aVBut it was a temp job.
p216
aVThe company told her there was a possibility
p217
aVit could turn into something more, but no guarantees.
p218
aVThis was in the fall of 2011.
p219
aVTracy loved this company, and she loved the people
p220
aVand the office was less than 10 minutes from her house.
p221
aVSo even though she had a second job offer
p222
aVat another company for a permanent full-time role,
p223
aVshe decided to take her chances with this internship
p224
aVand hope for the best.
p225
aVWell, she ended up blowing away all of their expectations,
p226
aVand the company not only made her a permanent offer
p227
aVat the beginning of 2012,
p228
aVbut they made it even more interesting and challenging,
p229
aVbecause they knew what Tracy could handle.
p230
aa(lp231
VFast forward to 2015,
p232
aVTracy's been promoted.
p233
aVThey've paid for her to get her MBA at night.
p234
aVShe's even hired another relauncher to work for her.
p235
aVTracy's temp job was a tryout,
p236
aVjust like an internship,
p237
aVand it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow, my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept
p240
aVto more and more employers.
p241
aVBut in the meantime,
p242
aVif you are returning to work after a career break,
p243
aVdon't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement
p244
aVto an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program.
p245
aVBe their first success story,
p246
aVand you can be the example for more relaunchers to come.
p247
aa(lp248
VThank you.

VI grew up with my identical twin,
p5
aVwho was an incredibly loving brother.
p6
aVNow, one thing about being a twin is,
p7
aVit makes you an expert at spotting favoritism.
p8
aVIf his cookie was even slightly bigger than my cookie,
p9
aVI had questions.
p10
aVAnd clearly, I wasn't starving.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VWhen I became a psychologist, I began to notice favoritism
p15
aVof a different kind;
p16
aVand that is, how much more we value the body than we do the mind.
p17
aVI spent nine years at university earning my doctorate in psychology,
p18
aVand I can't tell you how many people look at my business card and say,
p19
aV"Oh \u2014 a psychologist. So, not a real doctor,"
p20
aVas if it should say that on my card.

V[Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist (Not a Real Doctor)]
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VThis favoritism we show the body over the mind \u2014
p27
aVI see it everywhere.
p28
aa(lp29
VI recently was at a friend's house,
p30
aVand their five-year-old was getting ready for bed.
p31
aVHe was standing on a stool by the sink, brushing his teeth,
p32
aVwhen he slipped and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell.
p33
aVHe cried for a minute, but then he got back up,
p34
aVgot back on the stool, and reached out for a box of Band-Aids
p35
aVto put one on his cut.
p36
aVNow, this kid could barely tie his shoelaces,
p37
aVbut he knew you have to cover a cut so it doesn't become infected,
p38
aVand you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day.
p39
aVWe all know how to maintain our physical health
p40
aVand how to practice dental hygiene, right?
p41
aVWe've known it since we were five years old.
p42
aVBut what do we know about maintaining our psychological health?
p43
aVWell, nothing.
p44
aVWhat do we teach our children about emotional hygiene?
p45
aVNothing.
p46
aVHow is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth
p47
aVthan we do our minds?
p48
aVWhy is it that our physical health is so much more important to us
p49
aVthan our psychological health?
p50
aa(lp51
VWe sustain psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones,
p52
aVinjuries like failure or rejection or loneliness.
p53
aVAnd they can also get worse if we ignore them,
p54
aVand they can impact our lives in dramatic ways.
p55
aVAnd yet, even though there are scientifically proven techniques
p56
aVwe could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries,
p57
aVwe don't.
p58
aVIt doesn't even occur to us that we should.
p59
aV"Oh, you're feeling depressed? Just shake it off; it's all in your head."
p60
aVCan you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg:
p61
aV"Oh, just walk it off; it's all in your leg."
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VIt is time we closed the gap
p66
aVbetween our physical and our psychological health.
p67
aVIt's time we made them more equal,
p68
aVmore like twins.
p69
aa(lp70
VSpeaking of which, my brother is also a psychologist.
p71
aVSo he's not a real doctor, either.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VWe didn't study together, though.
p76
aVIn fact, the hardest thing I've ever done in my life
p77
aVis move across the Atlantic to New York City
p78
aVto get my doctorate in psychology.
p79
aVWe were apart then for the first time in our lives,
p80
aVand the separation was brutal for both of us.
p81
aVBut while he remained among family and friends,
p82
aVI was alone in a new country.
p83
aVWe missed each other terribly,
p84
aVbut international phone calls were really expensive then,
p85
aVand we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week.
p86
aVWhen our birthday rolled around,
p87
aVit was the first we wouldn't be spending together.
p88
aVWe decided to splurge,
p89
aVand that week, we would talk for 10 minutes.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VI spent the morning pacing around my room, waiting for him to call \u2014
p94
aVand waiting ...
p95
aVand waiting.
p96
aVBut the phone didn't ring.
p97
aVGiven the time difference, I assumed,
p98
aV"OK, he's out with friends, he'll call later."
p99
aVThere were no cell phones then.
p100
aVBut he didn't.
p101
aVAnd I began to realize that after being away for over 10 months,
p102
aVhe no longer missed me the way I missed him.
p103
aVI knew he would call in the morning,
p104
aVbut that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life.
p105
aVI woke up the next morning.
p106
aVI glanced down at the phone,
p107
aVand I realized I had kicked it off the hook
p108
aVwhen pacing the day before.
p109
aVI stumbled out of bed,
p110
aVI put the phone back on the receiver, and it rang a second later.
p111
aVAnd it was my brother,
p112
aVand boy, was he pissed.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VIt was the saddest and longest night of his life as well.
p117
aVNow, I tried to explain what happened, but he said,
p118
aV"I don't understand.
p119
aVIf you saw I wasn't calling you,
p120
aVwhy didn't you just pick up the phone and call me?"
p121
aVHe was right.
p122
aVWhy didn't I call him?
p123
aVI didn't have an answer then.
p124
aVBut I do today,
p125
aVand it's a simple one:
p126
aVloneliness.
p127
aa(lp128
VLoneliness creates a deep psychological wound,
p129
aVone that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking.
p130
aVIt makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do.
p131
aVIt make us really afraid to reach out,
p132
aVbecause why set yourself up for rejection and heartache
p133
aVwhen your heart is already aching more than you can stand?
p134
aVI was in the grips of real loneliness back then,
p135
aVbut I was surrounded by people all day, so it never occurred to me.
p136
aVBut loneliness is defined purely subjectively.
p137
aVIt depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected
p138
aVfrom those around you.
p139
aVAnd I did.
p140
aVThere is a lot of research on loneliness, and all of it is horrifying.
p141
aVLoneliness won't just make you miserable;
p142
aVit will kill you.
p143
aVI'm not kidding.
p144
aVChronic loneliness increases your likelihood of an early death
p145
aVby 14 percent.
p146
aVFourteen percent!
p147
aVLoneliness causes high blood pressure,
p148
aVhigh cholesterol.
p149
aVIt even suppress the functioning of your immune system,
p150
aVmaking you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases.
p151
aVIn fact, scientists have concluded that taken together,
p152
aVchronic loneliness poses as significant a risk
p153
aVfor your long-term health and longevity
p154
aVas cigarette smoking.
p155
aVNow, cigarette packs come with warnings saying, "This could kill you."
p156
aVBut loneliness doesn't.
p157
aVAnd that's why it's so important
p158
aVthat we prioritize our psychological health,
p159
aVthat we practice emotional hygiene.
p160
aVBecause you can't treat a psychological wound
p161
aVif you don't even know you're injured.
p162
aVLoneliness isn't the only psychological wound
p163
aVthat distorts our perceptions and misleads us.
p164
aa(lp165
VFailure does that as well.
p166
aVI once visited a day care center,
p167
aVwhere I saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys.
p168
aVYou had to slide the red button, and a cute doggie would pop out.
p169
aVOne little girl tried pulling the purple button, then pushing it,
p170
aVand then she just sat back and looked at the box
p171
aVwith her lower lip trembling.
p172
aVThe little boy next to her watched this happen,
p173
aVthen turned to his box and burst into tears without even touching it.
p174
aVMeanwhile, another little girl tried everything she could think of
p175
aVuntil she slid the red button,
p176
aVthe cute doggie popped out, and she squealed with delight.
p177
aVSo: three toddlers with identical plastic toys,
p178
aVbut with very different reactions to failure.
p179
aVThe first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button.
p180
aVThe only thing that prevented them from succeeding
p181
aVwas that their mind tricked them into believing they could not.
p182
aVNow, adults get tricked this way as well, all the time.
p183
aVIn fact, we all have a default set of feelings and beliefs
p184
aVthat gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks.
p185
aa(lp186
VAre you aware of how your mind reacts to failure?
p187
aVYou need to be.
p188
aVBecause if your mind tries to convince you you're incapable of something,
p189
aVand you believe it,
p190
aVthen like those two toddlers, you'll begin to feel helpless
p191
aVand you'll stop trying too soon, or you won't even try at all.
p192
aVAnd then you'll be even more convinced you can't succeed.
p193
aVYou see, that's why so many people function below their actual potential.
p194
aVBecause somewhere along the way, sometimes a single failure
p195
aVconvinced them that they couldn't succeed, and they believed it.
p196
aa(lp197
VOnce we become convinced of something, it's very difficult to change our mind.
p198
aVI learned that lesson the hard way when I was a teenager with my brother.
p199
aVWe were driving with friends down a dark road at night,
p200
aVwhen a police car stopped us.
p201
aVThere had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects.
p202
aVThe officer approached the car, and shined his flashlight on the driver,
p203
aVthen on my brother in the front seat,
p204
aVand then on me.
p205
aVAnd his eyes opened wide and he said,
p206
aV"Where have I seen your face before?"
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd I said,
p211
aV"In the front seat."
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VBut that made no sense to him whatsoever,
p216
aVso now he thought I was on drugs.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VSo he drags me out of the car, he searches me,
p221
aVhe marches me over to the police car,
p222
aVand only when he verified I didn't have a police record,
p223
aVcould I show him I had a twin in the front seat.
p224
aVBut even as we were driving away,
p225
aVyou could see by the look on his face he was convinced
p226
aVthat I was getting away with something.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VOur mind is hard to change once we become convinced.
p231
aVSo it might be very natural to feel demoralized
p232
aVand defeated after you fail.
p233
aVBut you cannot allow yourself to become convinced you can't succeed.
p234
aVYou have to fight feelings of helplessness.
p235
aVYou have to gain control over the situation.
p236
aVAnd you have to break this kind of negative cycle
p237
aVbefore it begins.
p238
aa(lp239
V[Stop Emotional Bleeding]
p240
aa(lp241
VOur minds and our feelings \u2014
p242
aVthey're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were.
p243
aVThey're more like a really moody friend,
p244
aVwho can be totally supportive one minute, and really unpleasant the next.
p245
aVI once worked with this woman who, after 20 years marriage
p246
aVand an extremely ugly divorce,
p247
aVwas finally ready for her first date.
p248
aVShe had met this guy online,
p249
aVand he seemed nice and he seemed successful,
p250
aVand most importantly, he seemed really into her.
p251
aVSo she was very excited, she bought a new dress,
p252
aVand they met at an upscale New York City bar for a drink.
p253
aVTen minutes into the date, the man stands up and says,
p254
aV"I'm not interested," and walks out.
p255
aVRejection is extremely painful.
p256
aVThe woman was so hurt she couldn't move.
p257
aVAll she could do was call a friend.
p258
aVHere's what the friend said: "Well, what do you expect?
p259
aVYou have big hips, you have nothing interesting to say.
p260
aVWhy would a handsome, successful man like that
p261
aVever go out with a loser like you?"
p262
aVShocking, right, that a friend could be so cruel?
p263
aVBut it would be much less shocking
p264
aVif I told you it wasn't the friend who said that.
p265
aVIt's what the woman said to herself.
p266
aVAnd that's something we all do,
p267
aVespecially after a rejection.
p268
aVWe all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings,
p269
aVwhat we wish we were, what we wish we weren't.
p270
aVWe call ourselves names.
p271
aVMaybe not as harshly, but we all do it.
p272
aVAnd it's interesting that we do,
p273
aVbecause our self-esteem is already hurting.
p274
aVWhy would we want to go and damage it even further?
p275
aVWe wouldn't make a physical injury worse on purpose.
p276
aVYou wouldn't get a cut on your arm and decide, "Oh! I know \u2014
p277
aVI'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper I can make it."
p278
aa(lp279
VBut we do that with psychological injuries all the time.
p280
aVWhy? Because of poor emotional hygiene.
p281
aVBecause we don't prioritize our psychological health.
p282
aVWe know from dozens of studies that when your self-esteem is lower,
p283
aVyou are more vulnerable to stress and to anxiety;
p284
aVthat failures and rejections hurt more,
p285
aVand it takes longer to recover from them.
p286
aVSo when you get rejected, the first thing you should be doing
p287
aVis to revive your self-esteem,
p288
aVnot join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp.
p289
aVWhen you're in emotional pain,
p290
aVtreat yourself with the same compassion
p291
aVyou would expect from a truly good friend.
p292
aa(lp293
V[Protect Your Self-Esteem]
p294
aa(lp295
VWe have to catch our unhealthy psychological habits and change them.
p296
aVAnd one of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination.
p297
aVTo ruminate means to chew over.
p298
aVIt's when your boss yells at you
p299
aVor your professor makes you feel stupid in class,
p300
aVor you have big fight with a friend
p301
aVand you just can't stop replaying the scene in your head for days,
p302
aVsometimes for weeks on end.
p303
aVNow, ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit,
p304
aVand it's a very costly one,
p305
aVbecause by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts,
p306
aVyou are actually putting yourself at significant risk
p307
aVfor developing clinical depression,
p308
aValcoholism,
p309
aVeating disorders,
p310
aVand even cardiovascular disease.
p311
aa(lp312
VThe problem is,
p313
aVthe urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important,
p314
aVso it's a difficult habit to stop.
p315
aVI know this for a fact,
p316
aVbecause a little over a year ago, I developed the habit myself.
p317
aVYou see, my twin brother was diagnosed with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
p318
aVHis cancer was extremely aggressive.
p319
aVHe had visible tumors all over his body.
p320
aVAnd he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy.
p321
aVAnd I couldn't stop thinking about what he was going through.
p322
aVI couldn't stop thinking about how much he was suffering,
p323
aVeven though he never complained, not once.
p324
aVHe had this incredibly positive attitude.
p325
aVHis psychological health was amazing.
p326
aVI was physically healthy, but psychologically, I was a mess.
p327
aVBut I knew what to do.
p328
aVStudies tell us that even a two-minute distraction is sufficient
p329
aVto break the urge to ruminate in that moment.
p330
aVAnd so each time I had a worrying, upsetting, negative thought,
p331
aVI forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed.
p332
aVAnd within one week, my whole outlook changed
p333
aVand became more positive and more hopeful.
p334
aa(lp335
V[Battle Negative Thinking]
p336
aa(lp337
VNine weeks after he started chemotherapy, my brother had a CAT scan,
p338
aVand I was by his side when he got the results.
p339
aVAll the tumors were gone.
p340
aVHe still had three more rounds of chemotherapy to go,
p341
aVbut we knew he would recover.
p342
aVThis picture was taken two weeks ago.
p343
aa(lp344
VBy taking action when you're lonely,
p345
aVby changing your responses to failure,
p346
aVby protecting your self-esteem,
p347
aVby battling negative thinking,
p348
aVyou won't just heal your psychological wounds,
p349
aVyou will build emotional resilience,
p350
aVyou will thrive.
p351
aVA hundred years ago, people began practicing personal hygiene,
p352
aVand life expectancy rates rose by over 50 percent
p353
aVin just a matter of decades.
p354
aVI believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically
p355
aVif we all began practicing emotional hygiene.
p356
aa(lp357
VCan you imagine what the world would be like
p358
aVif everyone was psychologically healthier?
p359
aVIf there were less loneliness and less depression?
p360
aVIf people knew how to overcome failure?
p361
aVIf they felt better about themselves and more empowered?
p362
aVIf they were happier and more fulfilled?
p363
aVI can, because that's the world I want to live in.
p364
aVAnd that's the world my brother wants to live in as well.
p365
aVAnd if you just become informed and change a few simple habits, well \u2014
p366
aVthat's the world we can all live in.
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you very much.

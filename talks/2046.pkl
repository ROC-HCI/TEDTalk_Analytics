VThe first time I stood in the operating room
p5
aVand watched a real surgery,
p6
aVI had no idea what to expect.
p7
aVI was a college student in engineering.
p8
aVI thought it was going to be like on TV.
p9
aVOminous music playing in the background,
p10
aVbeads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face.
p11
aVBut it wasn't like that at all.
p12
aVThere was music playing on this day,
p13
aVI think it was Madonna's greatest hits. (Laughter)
p14
aVAnd there was plenty of conversation,
p15
aVnot just about the patient's heart rate,
p16
aVbut about sports and weekend plans.
p17
aVAnd since then, the more surgeries I watched,
p18
aVthe more I realized this is how it is.
p19
aVIn some weird way, it's just another day at the office.
p20
aVBut every so often
p21
aVthe music gets turned down,
p22
aVeveryone stops talking,
p23
aVand stares at exactly the same thing.
p24
aVAnd that's when you know that something absolutely critical
p25
aVand dangerous is happening.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe first time I saw that
p28
aVI was watching a type of surgery
p29
aVcalled laparoscopic surgery
p30
aVAnd for those of you who are unfamiliar,
p31
aVlaparoscopic surgery, instead of the large
p32
aVopen incision you might be used to with surgery,
p33
aVa laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates
p34
aVthese three or more small incisions in the patient.
p35
aVAnd then inserts these long, thin instruments
p36
aVand a camera,
p37
aVand actually does the procedure inside the patient.
p38
aVThis is great because there's much less risk of infection,
p39
aVmuch less pain, shorter recovery time.
p40
aVBut there is a trade-off,
p41
aVbecause these incisions are created
p42
aVwith a long, pointed device
p43
aVcalled a trocar.
p44
aVAnd the way the surgeon uses this device
p45
aVis that he takes it
p46
aVand he presses it into the abdomen
p47
aVuntil it punctures through.
p48
aVAnd now the reason why  everyone in the operating room
p49
aVwas staring at that device on that day
p50
aVwas because he had to be absolutely careful
p51
aVnot to plunge it through
p52
aVand puncture it into the organs  and blood vessels below.
p53
aVBut this problem should seem  pretty familiar to all of you
p54
aVbecause I'm pretty sure  you've seen it somewhere else.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVRemember this?
p57
aV(Applause)
p58
aVYou knew that at any second
p59
aVthat straw was going to plunge through,
p60
aVand you didn't know if it was  going to go out the other side
p61
aVand straight into your hand,
p62
aVor if you were going to get juice everywhere,
p63
aVbut you were terrified. Right?
p64
aVEvery single time you did this,
p65
aVyou experienced the same fundamental physics
p66
aVthat I was watching in the operating room that day.
p67
aVAnd it turns out it really is a problem.
p68
aVIn 2003, the FDA actually came out and said
p69
aVthat trocar incisions might  be the most dangerous step
p70
aVin minimally invasive surgery.
p71
aVAgain in 2009, we see a paper that says
p72
aVthat trocars account for over half
p73
aVof all major complications in laparoscopic surgery.
p74
aVAnd, oh by the way,
p75
aVthis hasn't changed for 25 years.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo when I got to graduate school,
p78
aVthis is what I wanted to work on.
p79
aVI was trying to explain to a friend of mine
p80
aVwhat exactly I was spending my time doing,
p81
aVand I said,
p82
aV"It's like when you're drilling through a wall
p83
aVto hang something in your apartment.
p84
aVThere's that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall
p85
aVand there's this plunge. Right?
p86
aVAnd he looked at me and he said,
p87
aV"You mean like when they drill  into people's brains?"
p88
aVAnd I said, "Excuse me?" (Laughter)
p89
aVAnd then I looked it up and they do drill into people's brains.
p90
aVA lot of neurosurgical procedures
p91
aVactually start with a drill incision through the skull.
p92
aVAnd if the surgeon isn't careful,
p93
aVhe can plunge directly into the brain.
p94
aVSo this is the moment when I started thinking,
p95
aVokay, cranial drilling, laparoscopic surgery,
p96
aVwhy not other areas of medicine?
p97
aVBecause think about it, when was the last time you went to the doctor
p98
aVand you didn't get stuck with something? Right?
p99
aVSo the truth is
p100
aVin medicine puncture is everywhere.
p101
aVAnd here are just a couple of the procedures that I've found
p102
aVthat involve some tissue puncture step.
p103
aVAnd if we take just three of them \u2014
p104
aVlaparoscopic surgery,  epidurals, and cranial drilling \u2014
p105
aVthese procedures account  for over 30,000 complications
p106
aVevery year in this country alone.
p107
aVI call that a problem worth solving.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo let's take a look at some of the devices
p110
aVthat are used in these types of procedures.
p111
aVI mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle.
p112
aVIt's used to puncture through  the ligaments in the spine
p113
aVand deliver anesthesia during childbirth.
p114
aVHere's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools.
p115
aVThese are actually used to burrow into the bone
p116
aVand collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions.
p117
aVHere's a bayonette from the Civil War.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVIf I had told you it was a  medical puncture device
p120
aVyou probably would have believed me.
p121
aVBecause what's the difference?
p122
aVSo, the more I did this research
p123
aVthe more I thought there has to be
p124
aVa better way to do this.
p125
aVAnd for me the key to this problem
p126
aVis that all these different puncture devices
p127
aVshare a common set of fundamental physics.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo what are those physics?
p130
aVLet's go back to drilling through a wall.
p131
aVSo you're applying a force  on a drill towards the wall.
p132
aVAnd Newton says the wall is going to apply force back,
p133
aVequal and opposite.
p134
aVSo, as you drill through the wall,
p135
aVthose forces balance.
p136
aVBut then there's that moment
p137
aVwhen the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall,
p138
aVand right at that moment  the wall can't push back anymore.
p139
aVBut your brain hasn't reacted  to that change in force.
p140
aVSo for that millisecond,
p141
aVor however long it takes you  to react, you're still pushing,
p142
aVand that unbalanced force  causes an acceleration,
p143
aVand that is the plunge.
p144
aVBut what if right at the moment of puncture
p145
aVyou could pull that tip back,
p146
aVactually oppose the forward acceleration?
p147
aVThat's what I set out to do.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo imagine you have a device
p150
aVand it's got some kind of sharp tip  to cut through tissue.
p151
aVWhat's the simplest way  you could pull that tip back?
p152
aVI chose a spring.
p153
aVSo when you extend that spring,  you extend that tip out
p154
aVso it's ready to puncture tissue,
p155
aVthe spring wants to pull the tip back.
p156
aVHow do you keep the tip in place
p157
aVuntil the moment of puncture?
p158
aVI used this mechanism.
p159
aVWhen the tip of the device is pressed against tissue,
p160
aVthe mechanism expands outwards  and wedges in place against the wall.
p161
aVAnd the friction that's generated
p162
aVlocks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip.
p163
aVBut right at the moment of puncture,
p164
aVthe tissue can't push back on the tip anymore.
p165
aVSo the mechanism unlocks  and the spring retracts the tip.
p166
aVLet me show you that  happening in slow motion.
p167
aVThis is about 2,000 frames a second,
p168
aVand I'd like you to notice the tip
p169
aVthat's right there on the bottom,  about to puncture through tissue.
p170
aVAnd you'll see that  right at the moment of puncture,
p171
aVright there, the mechanism unlocks  and retracts that tip back.
p172
aVI want to show it to you again, a little closer up.
p173
aVYou're going to see the sharp bladed tip,
p174
aVand right when it punctures  that rubber membrane
p175
aVit's going to disappear into this white blunt sheath.
p176
aVRight there.
p177
aVThat happens within four 100ths  of a second after puncture.
p178
aVAnd because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture
p179
aVand not the specifics of cranial drilling
p180
aVor laparoscopic surgery,  or another procedure,
p181
aVit's applicable across these different medical disciplines
p182
aVand across different length scales.
p183
aa(lp184
VBut it didn't always look like this.
p185
aVThis was my first prototype.
p186
aVYes, those are popsicle sticks,
p187
aVand there's a rubber band at the top.
p188
aVIt took about 30 minutes to do this, but it worked.
p189
aVAnd it proved to me that my idea worked
p190
aVand it justified the next couple years of work on this project.
p191
aVI worked on this because
p192
aVthis problem really fascinated me.
p193
aVIt kept me up at night.
p194
aVBut I think it should fascinate you too,
p195
aVbecause I said puncture is everywhere.
p196
aVThat means at some point  it's going to be your problem too.
p197
aVThat first day in the operating room
p198
aVI never expected to find myself  on the other end of a trocar.
p199
aVBut last year, I got appendicitis  when I was visiting Greece.
p200
aVSo I was in the hospital in Athens,
p201
aVand the surgeon was telling me
p202
aVhe was going to perform  a laparoscopic surgery.
p203
aVHe was going to remove my appendix  through these tiny incisions,
p204
aVand he was talking about what I could expect for the recovery,
p205
aVand what was going to happen.
p206
aVHe said, "Do you have any questions?" And I said, "Just one, doc.
p207
aVWhat kind of trocar do you use?"
p208
aa(lp209
VSo my favorite quote  about laparoscopic surgery
p210
aVcomes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus:
p211
aV"It is puncture itself that causes risk."
p212
aVThat's my favorite quote  because H.C. Jacobaeus
p213
aVwas the first person to ever perform  laparoscopic surgery on humans,
p214
aVand he wrote that in 1912.
p215
aVThis is a problem that's been injuring and even killing people for over 100 years.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo it's easy to think that for every major problem out there
p218
aVthere's some team of experts  working around the clock to solve it.
p219
aVThe truth is that's not always the case.
p220
aVWe have to be better at finding those problems
p221
aVand finding ways to solve them.
p222
aVSo if you come across a problem that grabs you,
p223
aVlet it keep you up at night.
p224
aVAllow yourself to be fascinated,
p225
aVbecause there are so many lives to save.

VDelighted to be here
p5
aVand to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart,
p6
aVwhich is beauty.
p7
aVI do the philosophy of art, aesthetics,
p8
aVactually, for a living.
p9
aVI try to figure out intellectually,
p10
aVphilosophically, psychologically,
p11
aVwhat the experience of beauty is,
p12
aVwhat sensibly can be said about it
p13
aVand how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.
p14
aVNow this is an extremely complicated subject,
p15
aVin part because the things that we call beautiful
p16
aVare so different.
p17
aVI mean just think of the sheer variety \u2014
p18
aVa baby's face,
p19
aVBerlioz's "Harold in Italy,"
p20
aVmovies like "The Wizard of Oz"
p21
aVor the plays of Chekhov,
p22
aVa central California landscape,
p23
aVa Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji,
p24
aV"Der Rosenkavalier,"
p25
aVa stunning match-winning goal
p26
aVin a World Cup soccer match,
p27
aVVan Gogh's "Starry Night,"
p28
aVa Jane Austen novel,
p29
aVFred Astaire dancing across the screen.
p30
aVThis brief list includes human beings,
p31
aVnatural landforms,
p32
aVworks of art and skilled human actions.
p33
aVAn account that explains the presence of beauty
p34
aVin everything on this list
p35
aVis not going to be easy.
p36
aa(lp37
VI can, however, give you at least a taste
p38
aVof what I regard
p39
aVas the most powerful theory of beauty
p40
aVwe yet have.
p41
aVAnd we get it not from a philosopher of art,
p42
aVnot from a postmodern art theorist
p43
aVor a bigwig art critic.
p44
aVNo, this theory
p45
aVcomes from an expert
p46
aVon barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding,
p47
aVand you know who I mean:
p48
aVCharles Darwin.
p49
aVOf course, a lot of people think they already know
p50
aVthe proper answer to the question,
p51
aV"What is beauty?"
p52
aVIt's in the eye of the beholder.
p53
aVIt's whatever moves you personally.
p54
aVOr, as some people,
p55
aVespecially academics prefer,
p56
aVbeauty is in the culturally conditioned
p57
aVeye of the beholder.
p58
aVPeople agree that paintings or movies or music
p59
aVare beautiful
p60
aVbecause their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste.
p61
aVTaste for both natural beauty and for the arts
p62
aVtravel across cultures
p63
aVwith great ease.
p64
aVBeethoven is adored in Japan.
p65
aVPeruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.
p66
aVInca sculptures are regarded as treasures
p67
aVin British museums,
p68
aVwhile Shakespeare is translated
p69
aVinto every major language of the Earth.
p70
aVOr just think about American jazz
p71
aVor American movies \u2014
p72
aVthey go everywhere.
p73
aVThere are many differences among the arts,
p74
aVbut there are also universal,
p75
aVcross-cultural aesthetic pleasures
p76
aVand values.
p77
aa(lp78
VHow can we explain
p79
aVthis universality?
p80
aVThe best answer lies in trying to reconstruct
p81
aVa Darwinian evolutionary history
p82
aVof our artistic and aesthetic tastes.
p83
aVWe need to reverse-engineer
p84
aVour present artistic tastes and preferences
p85
aVand explain how they came
p86
aVto be engraved in our minds
p87
aVby the actions of both our prehistoric,
p88
aVlargely pleistocene environments,
p89
aVwhere we became fully human,
p90
aVbut also by the social situations
p91
aVin which we evolved.
p92
aVThis reverse engineering
p93
aVcan also enlist help
p94
aVfrom the human record
p95
aVpreserved in prehistory.
p96
aVI mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.
p97
aVAnd it should take into account
p98
aVwhat we know of the aesthetic interests
p99
aVof isolated hunter-gatherer bands
p100
aVthat survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, I personally
p103
aVhave no doubt whatsoever
p104
aVthat the experience of beauty,
p105
aVwith its emotional intensity and pleasure,
p106
aVbelongs to our evolved human psychology.
p107
aVThe experience of beauty is one component
p108
aVin a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.
p109
aVBeauty is an adaptive effect,
p110
aVwhich we extend
p111
aVand intensify
p112
aVin the creation and enjoyment
p113
aVof works of art and entertainment.
p114
aVAs many of you will know,
p115
aVevolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.
p116
aVThe first of these is natural selection \u2014
p117
aVthat's random mutation and selective retention \u2014
p118
aValong with our basic anatomy and physiology \u2014
p119
aVthe evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.
p120
aVNatural selection also explains
p121
aVmany basic revulsions,
p122
aVsuch as the horrid smell of rotting meat,
p123
aVor fears, such as the fear of snakes
p124
aVor standing close to the edge of a cliff.
p125
aVNatural selection also explains pleasures \u2014
p126
aVsexual pleasure,
p127
aVour liking for sweet, fat and proteins,
p128
aVwhich in turn explains a lot of popular foods,
p129
aVfrom ripe fruits through chocolate malts
p130
aVand barbecued ribs.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe other great principle of evolution
p133
aVis sexual selection,
p134
aVand it operates very differently.
p135
aVThe peacock's magnificent tail
p136
aVis the most famous example of this.
p137
aVIt did not evolve for natural survival.
p138
aVIn fact, it goes against natural survival.
p139
aVNo, the peacock's tail
p140
aVresults from the mating choices
p141
aVmade by peahens.
p142
aVIt's quite a familiar story.
p143
aVIt's women who actually push history forward.
p144
aVDarwin himself, by the way,
p145
aVhad no doubts that the peacock's tail
p146
aVwas beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.
p147
aVHe actually used that word.
p148
aVNow, keeping these ideas firmly in mind,
p149
aVwe can say that the experience of beauty
p150
aVis one of the ways that evolution has
p151
aVof arousing and sustaining
p152
aVinterest or fascination,
p153
aVeven obsession,
p154
aVin order to encourage us
p155
aVtoward making the most adaptive decisions
p156
aVfor survival and reproduction.
p157
aVBeauty is nature's way
p158
aVof acting at a distance,
p159
aVso to speak.
p160
aVI mean, you can't expect to eat
p161
aVan adaptively beneficial landscape.
p162
aVIt would hardly do to eat your baby
p163
aVor your lover.
p164
aVSo evolution's trick
p165
aVis to make them beautiful,
p166
aVto have them exert a kind of magnetism
p167
aVto give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.
p168
aa(lp169
VConsider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure,
p170
aVthe magnetic pull
p171
aVof beautiful landscapes.
p172
aVPeople in very different cultures
p173
aVall over the world
p174
aVtend to like a particular kind of landscape,
p175
aVa landscape that just happens to be similar
p176
aVto the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.
p177
aVThis landscape shows up today
p178
aVon calendars, on postcards,
p179
aVin the design of golf courses and public parks
p180
aVand in gold-framed pictures
p181
aVthat hang in living rooms
p182
aVfrom New York to New Zealand.
p183
aVIt's a kind of Hudson River school landscape
p184
aVfeaturing open spaces
p185
aVof low grasses
p186
aVinterspersed with copses of trees.
p187
aVThe trees, by the way, are often preferred
p188
aVif they fork near the ground,
p189
aVthat is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up
p190
aVif you were in a tight fix.
p191
aVThe landscape shows the presence
p192
aVof water directly in view,
p193
aVor evidence of water in a bluish distance,
p194
aVindications of animal or bird life
p195
aVas well as diverse greenery
p196
aVand finally \u2014 get this \u2014
p197
aVa path
p198
aVor a road,
p199
aVperhaps a riverbank or a shoreline,
p200
aVthat extends into the distance,
p201
aValmost inviting you to follow it.
p202
aVThis landscape type is regarded as beautiful,
p203
aVeven by people in countries
p204
aVthat don't have it.
p205
aVThe ideal savanna landscape
p206
aVis one of the clearest examples
p207
aVwhere human beings everywhere
p208
aVfind beauty
p209
aVin similar visual experience.
p210
aa(lp211
VBut, someone might argue,
p212
aVthat's natural beauty.
p213
aVHow about artistic beauty?
p214
aVIsn't that exhaustively cultural?
p215
aVNo, I don't think it is.
p216
aVAnd once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory
p217
aVto say something about it.
p218
aVIt is widely assumed
p219
aVthat the earliest human artworks
p220
aVare the stupendously skillful cave paintings
p221
aVthat we all know from Lascaux
p222
aVand Chauvet.
p223
aVChauvet caves
p224
aVare about 32,000 years old,
p225
aValong with a few small, realistic sculptures
p226
aVof women and animals from the same period.
p227
aVBut artistic and decorative skills
p228
aVare actually much older than that.
p229
aVBeautiful shell necklaces
p230
aVthat look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,
p231
aVas well as ochre body paint,
p232
aVhave been found
p233
aVfrom around 100,000 years ago.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts
p236
aVare older even than this.
p237
aVI have in mind
p238
aVthe so-called Acheulian hand axes.
p239
aVThe oldest stone tools are choppers
p240
aVfrom the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.
p241
aVThey go back about two-and-a-half-million years.
p242
aVThese crude tools
p243
aVwere around for thousands of centuries,
p244
aVuntil around 1.4 million years ago
p245
aVwhen Homo erectus
p246
aVstarted shaping
p247
aVsingle, thin stone blades,
p248
aVsometimes rounded ovals,
p249
aVbut often in what are to our eyes
p250
aVan arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf
p251
aVor teardrop form.
p252
aVThese Acheulian hand axes \u2014
p253
aVthey're named after St. Acheul in France,
p254
aVwhere finds were made in 19th century \u2014
p255
aVhave been unearthed in their thousands,
p256
aVscattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,
p257
aValmost everywhere Homo erectus
p258
aVand Homo ergaster roamed.
p259
aVNow, the sheer numbers of these hand axes
p260
aVshows that they can't have been made
p261
aVfor butchering animals.
p262
aVAnd the plot really thickens when you realize
p263
aVthat, unlike other pleistocene tools,
p264
aVthe hand axes often exhibit
p265
aVno evidence of wear
p266
aVon their delicate blade edges.
p267
aVAnd some, in any event, are too big
p268
aVto use for butchery.
p269
aVTheir symmetry, their attractive materials
p270
aVand, above all,
p271
aVtheir meticulous workmanship
p272
aVare simply quite beautiful
p273
aVto our eyes, even today.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo what were these ancient \u2014
p276
aVI mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,
p277
aVbut they're at the same time
p278
aVsomehow familiar.
p279
aVWhat were these artifacts for?
p280
aVThe best available answer
p281
aVis that they were literally
p282
aVthe earliest known works of art,
p283
aVpractical tools transformed
p284
aVinto captivating aesthetic objects,
p285
aVcontemplated both for their elegant shape
p286
aVand their virtuoso craftsmanship.
p287
aVHand axes mark
p288
aVan evolutionary advance in human history \u2014
p289
aVtools fashioned to function
p290
aVas what Darwinians call "fitness signals" \u2014
p291
aVthat is to say, displays
p292
aVthat are performances
p293
aVlike the peacock's tail,
p294
aVexcept that, unlike hair and feathers,
p295
aVthe hand axes are consciously
p296
aVcleverly crafted.
p297
aVCompetently made hand axes
p298
aVindicated desirable personal qualities \u2014
p299
aVintelligence, fine motor control,
p300
aVplanning ability,
p301
aVconscientiousness
p302
aVand sometimes access to rare materials.
p303
aVOver tens of thousands of generations,
p304
aVsuch skills increased the status
p305
aVof those who displayed them
p306
aVand gained a reproductive advantage
p307
aVover the less capable.
p308
aVYou know, it's an old line,
p309
aVbut it has been shown to work \u2014
p310
aV"Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?"
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VExcept, of course, what's interesting about this
p315
aVis that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed,
p316
aVbecause the Homo erectus
p317
aVthat made these objects
p318
aVdid not have language.
p319
aVIt's hard to grasp,
p320
aVbut it's an incredible fact.
p321
aVThis object was made
p322
aVby a hominid ancestor,
p323
aVHomo erectus or Homo ergaster,
p324
aVbetween 50,000 and 100,000 years
p325
aVbefore language.
p326
aVStretching over a million years,
p327
aVthe hand axe tradition
p328
aVis the longest artistic tradition
p329
aVin human and proto-human history.
p330
aVBy the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens \u2014
p331
aVas they were then called, finally \u2014
p332
aVwere doubtless finding new ways
p333
aVto amuse and amaze each other
p334
aVby, who knows, telling jokes,
p335
aVstorytelling, dancing, or hairstyling.
p336
aVYes, hairstyling \u2014 I insist on that.
p337
aa(lp338
VFor us moderns,
p339
aVvirtuoso technique
p340
aVis used to create imaginary worlds
p341
aVin fiction and in movies,
p342
aVto express intense emotions
p343
aVwith music, painting and dance.
p344
aVBut still,
p345
aVone fundamental trait
p346
aVof the ancestral personality persists
p347
aVin our aesthetic cravings:
p348
aVthe beauty we find
p349
aVin skilled performances.
p350
aVFrom Lascaux to the Louvre
p351
aVto Carnegie Hall,
p352
aVhuman beings
p353
aVhave a permanent innate taste
p354
aVfor virtuoso displays in the arts.
p355
aVWe find beauty
p356
aVin something done well.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo the next time you pass a jewelry shop window
p359
aVdisplaying a beautifully cut
p360
aVteardrop-shaped stone,
p361
aVdon't be so sure
p362
aVit's just your culture telling you
p363
aVthat that sparkling jewel is beautiful.
p364
aVYour distant ancestors loved that shape
p365
aVand found beauty in the skill needed to make it,
p366
aVeven before
p367
aVthey could put their love into words.
p368
aVIs beauty in the eye of the beholder?
p369
aVNo, it's deep in our minds.
p370
aVIt's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills
p371
aVand rich emotional lives
p372
aVof our most ancient ancestors.
p373
aVOur powerful reaction to images,
p374
aVto the expression of emotion in art,
p375
aVto the beauty of music, to the night sky,
p376
aVwill be with us and our descendants
p377
aVfor as long as the human race exists.
p378
aa(lp379
VThank you.

pleasure in making art? In his 2009 book <a href=\\"http://www.theartinstinct.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Art Instinct</em></a>, philosopher Denis Dutton suggested that art is a need built into our systems, a complex and subtle evolutionary adaptation comparable to our facility for language. We humans evolved to love art because it helps us survive; for example, a well-expressed appreciation of art can -- even in modern times -- help us to find a mate. It&rsquo;s a bold argument to make, bolstered by examples from the breadth of art history that Dutton kept at his fingertips.</p><p>Dutton taught philosophy at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, and was the editor of <a href=\\"http://www.aldaily.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Arts &amp; Letters Daily</a>, a three-column compendium of culture news from all over the web. (<a href=\\"http://www.denisdutton.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">His own homepage</a>  is another storehouse of tidbits from his wide-ranging explorations in philosophy and culture.) He was on the advisory board of Cybereditions, a publisher specializing in ebooks and print-on-demand editions of nonfiction works.

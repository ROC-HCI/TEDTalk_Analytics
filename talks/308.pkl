VAs a clergyman,
p5
aVyou can imagine how
p6
aVout of place I feel.
p7
aVI feel like a fish out of water,
p8
aVor maybe an owl out of the air.
p9
aa(lp10

p11
aa(lp12
VI was preaching in San Jose some time ago,
p13
aVand my friend Mark Kvamme,
p14
aVwho helped introduce me
p15
aVto this conference,
p16
aVbrought several CEOs
p17
aVand leaders
p18
aVof some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley
p19
aVto have breakfast with me, or I with them.
p20
aVAnd I was so stimulated.
p21
aVAnd had such \u2014 it was an
p22
aVeye-opening experience
p23
aVto hear them talk about
p24
aVthe world that is yet to come
p25
aVthrough technology
p26
aVand science.
p27
aVI know that we're near the end of this conference,
p28
aVand some of you may be wondering
p29
aVwhy they have a speaker
p30
aVfrom the field of religion.
p31
aVRichard can answer that,
p32
aVbecause he made that decision.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia,
p35
aVcoming down.
p36
aVI was to address a conference
p37
aVat a hotel.
p38
aVAnd on that elevator a man said,
p39
aV"I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel."
p40
aVAnd another man looked in my direction and said,
p41
aV"Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us."
p42
aVAnd this man looked me up and down
p43
aVfor about 10 seconds,
p44
aVand he said, "My, what an anticlimax!"
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VI hope
p49
aVthat you won't feel that these few moments with me
p50
aVis not a \u2014 is an anticlimax,
p51
aVafter all these tremendous
p52
aVtalks that you've heard,
p53
aVand addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them.
p54
aVBut I was
p55
aVon an airplane in the east some years ago,
p56
aVand the man sitting across the aisle from me
p57
aVwas the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.
p58
aVHis name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him.
p59
aVAnd there was a drunk man on there,
p60
aVand he got up out of his seat two or three times,
p61
aVand he was making everybody upset
p62
aVby what he was trying to do.
p63
aVAnd he was slapping the stewardess
p64
aVand pinching her as she went by,
p65
aVand everybody was upset with him.
p66
aVAnd finally, John Belk said,
p67
aV"Do you know who's sitting here?"
p68
aVAnd the man said, "No, who?"
p69
aVHe said, "It's Billy Graham,
p70
aVthe preacher."
p71
aVHe said, "You don't say!"
p72
aVAnd he turned to me, and he said, "Put her there!"
p73
aVHe said, "Your sermons have certainly helped me."
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd I suppose that that's true
p78
aVwith thousands of people.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VI know that as you have been peering into the future,
p83
aVand as we've heard some of it here tonight,
p84
aVI would like to live in that age
p85
aVand see what is going to be.
p86
aVBut I won't,
p87
aVbecause I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year,
p88
aVand I know that my time is brief.
p89
aVI have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs,
p90
aVand that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here,
p91
aVbecause I have Parkinson's disease
p92
aVin addition to that,
p93
aVand some other problems that I won't talk about.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VBut this is not the first time
p98
aVthat we've had a technological revolution.
p99
aVWe've had others.
p100
aVAnd there's one that I want to talk about.
p101
aVIn one generation,
p102
aVthe nation of the people of Israel
p103
aVhad a tremendous and dramatic change
p104
aVthat made them a great power in the Near East.
p105
aVA man by the name of David
p106
aVcame to the throne,
p107
aVand King David became one of the great leaders
p108
aVof his generation.
p109
aVHe was a man of tremendous leadership.
p110
aVHe had the favor of God with him.
p111
aVHe was a brilliant poet,
p112
aVphilosopher, writer, soldier \u2014
p113
aVwith strategies in battle and conflict
p114
aVthat people study even today.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut about two centuries before David,
p117
aVthe Hittites
p118
aVhad discovered the secret
p119
aVof smelting and processing of iron,
p120
aVand, slowly, that skill spread.
p121
aVBut they wouldn't allow the Israelis
p122
aVto look into it, or to have any.
p123
aVBut David changed all of that,
p124
aVand he introduced the Iron Age
p125
aVto Israel.
p126
aVAnd the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,
p127
aVand which archaeologists have found,
p128
aVthat in present-day Palestine,
p129
aVthere are evidences of that generation.
p130
aVNow, instead of crude tools
p131
aVmade of sticks and stones,
p132
aVIsrael now had iron plows,
p133
aVand sickles, and hoes
p134
aVand military weapons.
p135
aVAnd in the course of one generation,
p136
aVIsrael was completely changed.
p137
aVThe introduction of iron, in some ways,
p138
aVhad an impact
p139
aVa little bit like the microchip
p140
aVhas had on our generation.
p141
aVAnd
p142
aVDavid found
p143
aVthat there were many problems that technology could not solve.
p144
aa(lp145
VThere were many problems still left.
p146
aVAnd they're still with us, and you haven't solved them,
p147
aVand I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.
p148
aVHow do we solve these three problems
p149
aVthat I'd like to mention?
p150
aVThe first one that David saw
p151
aVwas human evil.
p152
aVWhere does it come from?
p153
aVHow do we solve it?
p154
aVOver again and again
p155
aVin the Psalms,
p156
aVwhich Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,
p157
aVDavid describes the evils of the human race.
p158
aVAnd yet he says,
p159
aV"He restores my soul."
p160
aVHave you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?
p161
aVOn one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe
p162
aVand dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,
p163
aVas this conference vividly demonstrates.
p164
aVWe've seen under the sea,
p165
aVthree miles down,
p166
aVor galaxies hundreds of billions of years
p167
aVout in the future.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut on the other hand,
p170
aVsomething is wrong.
p171
aVOur battleships,
p172
aVour soldiers,
p173
aVare on a frontier now,
p174
aValmost ready to go to war
p175
aVwith Iraq.
p176
aVNow, what causes this?
p177
aVWhy do we have these wars in every generation,
p178
aVand in every part of the world?
p179
aVAnd revolutions?
p180
aVWe can't get along with other people,
p181
aVeven in our own families.
p182
aVWe find ourselves in the paralyzing grip
p183
aVof self-destructive habits we can't break.
p184
aVRacism and injustice and violence sweep our world,
p185
aVbringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.
p186
aVEven the most sophisticated among us
p187
aVseem powerless to break this cycle.
p188
aVI would like to see Oracle
p189
aVtake up that,
p190
aVor
p191
aVsome other
p192
aVtechnological geniuses work on this.
p193
aVHow do we change man,
p194
aVso that he doesn't lie and cheat,
p195
aVand our newspapers are not filled with stories
p196
aVof fraud in business or labor
p197
aVor athletics or wherever?
p198
aa(lp199
VThe Bible says the problem is within us,
p200
aVwithin our hearts and our souls.
p201
aVOur problem is that we are separated
p202
aVfrom our Creator,
p203
aVwhich we call God,
p204
aVand we need to have our souls restored,
p205
aVsomething only God can do.
p206
aVJesus said, "For out of the heart
p207
aVcome evil thoughts:
p208
aVmurders, sexual immorality,
p209
aVtheft, false testimonies,
p210
aVslander."
p211
aVThe British philosopher Bertrand Russell
p212
aVwas not a religious man,
p213
aVbut he said, "It's in our hearts that the evil lies,
p214
aVand it's from our hearts
p215
aVthat it must be plucked out."
p216
aVAlbert Einstein \u2014
p217
aVI was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton,
p218
aVand I met
p219
aVMr. Einstein.
p220
aVHe didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said
p221
aVnobody was qualified to give him one.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VBut he made this statement.
p226
aVHe said, "It's easier to denature plutonium
p227
aVthan to denature the evil spirit of man."
p228
aVAnd many of you, I'm sure,
p229
aVhave thought about that
p230
aVand puzzled over it.
p231
aVYou've seen people
p232
aVtake beneficial technological advances,
p233
aVsuch as the Internet we've heard about tonight,
p234
aVand twist them into something corrupting.
p235
aVYou've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses
p236
aVthat bring down whole systems.
p237
aVThe Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology,
p238
aVhorribly used.
p239
aVThe problem is not technology.
p240
aVThe problem is the person or persons using it.
p241
aVKing David said
p242
aVthat he knew the depths of his own soul.
p243
aVHe couldn't free himself from personal problems
p244
aVand personal evils
p245
aVthat included murder and adultery.
p246
aVYet King David sought God's forgiveness,
p247
aVand said, "You can restore my soul."
p248
aa(lp249
VYou see, the Bible teaches
p250
aVthat we're more than a body and a mind.
p251
aVWe are a soul.
p252
aVAnd there's something inside of us
p253
aVthat is beyond our understanding.
p254
aVThat's the part of us that yearns
p255
aVfor God, or something more
p256
aVthan we find in technology.
p257
aVYour soul is that part of you that
p258
aVyearns for meaning in life,
p259
aVand which seeks for something beyond this life.
p260
aVIt's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.
p261
aVI find [that] young people all over the world
p262
aVare searching for something.
p263
aVThey don't know what it is. I speak at many universities,
p264
aVand I have many questions and answer periods, and
p265
aVwhether it's Cambridge, or Harvard,
p266
aVor Oxford \u2014
p267
aVI've spoken at all of those universities.
p268
aVI'm going to Harvard in about three or four \u2014
p269
aVno, it's about two months from now \u2014
p270
aVto give a lecture.
p271
aVAnd I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked
p272
aVthe last few times I've been there.
p273
aVAnd it'll be on
p274
aVthese questions:
p275
aVwhere did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going?
p276
aVWhat's life all about? Why am I here?
p277
aa(lp278
VEven if you have no religious belief,
p279
aVthere are times when you wonder that there's something else.
p280
aVThomas Edison also said,
p281
aV"When you see everything that happens in the world of science,
p282
aVand in the working of the universe,
p283
aVyou cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge."
p284
aVI remember once,
p285
aVI sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev
p286
aVat a White House dinner.
p287
aVI went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well.
p288
aVAnd I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists,
p289
aVand they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect.
p290
aVAnd I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well,
p291
aVand I said,
p292
aV"I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight.
p293
aVWhat shall I talk to her about?"
p294
aVAnd he surprised me with the answer.
p295
aVHe said, "Talk to her about religion and philosophy.
p296
aVThat's what she's really interested in."
p297
aVI was a little bit surprised, but that evening
p298
aVthat's what we talked about,
p299
aVand it was a stimulating conversation.
p300
aVAnd afterward, she said,
p301
aV"You know, I'm an atheist,
p302
aVbut I know that there's something up there
p303
aVhigher than we are."
p304
aa(lp305
VThe second problem
p306
aVthat King David realized he could not solve
p307
aVwas the problem of human suffering.
p308
aVWriting the oldest book in the world was Job,
p309
aVand he said,
p310
aV"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward."
p311
aVYes, to be sure, science has done much to push back
p312
aVcertain types of human suffering.
p313
aVBut I'm \u2014
p314
aVin a few months, I'll be 80 years of age.
p315
aVI admit that I'm very grateful
p316
aVfor all the medical advances
p317
aVthat have kept me in relatively good health
p318
aVall these years.
p319
aVMy doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me
p320
aVnot to take this trip out here to this \u2014 to be here.
p321
aVI haven't given a talk in nearly four months.
p322
aVAnd when you speak as much as I do,
p323
aVthree or four times a day,
p324
aVyou get rusty.
p325
aVThat's the reason I'm using this podium
p326
aVand using these notes.
p327
aVEvery time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere,
p328
aVI'm ad-libbing.
p329
aVI'm not reading. I never read an address.
p330
aVI never read a speech or a talk or a lecture.
p331
aVI talk ad lib.
p332
aVBut tonight, I've
p333
aVgot some notes here so that if
p334
aVI begin to forget,
p335
aVwhich I do sometimes,
p336
aVI've got something I can turn to.
p337
aa(lp338
VBut even here among us,
p339
aVmost \u2014
p340
aVin the most advanced society in the world,
p341
aVwe have poverty.
p342
aVWe have families that self-destruct,
p343
aVfriends that betray us.
p344
aVUnbearable psychological pressures bear down on us.
p345
aVI've never met a person in the world
p346
aVthat didn't have a problem
p347
aVor a worry.
p348
aVWhy do we suffer? It's an age-old question
p349
aVthat we haven't answered.
p350
aVYet David again and again said
p351
aVthat he would turn to God.
p352
aVHe said, "The Lord is my shepherd."
p353
aVThe final problem that David knew he could not solve
p354
aVwas death.
p355
aVMany commentators have said that death
p356
aVis the forbidden subject of our generation.
p357
aVMost people live as if
p358
aVthey're never going to die.
p359
aVTechnology projects the myth
p360
aVof control over our mortality.
p361
aVWe see people on our screens.
p362
aVMarilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen
p363
aVas she was in person,
p364
aVand our \u2014 many young people think she's still alive.
p365
aVThey don't know that she's dead.
p366
aVOr Clark Gable, or whoever it is.
p367
aVThe old stars, they come to life.
p368
aVAnd they're \u2014
p369
aVthey're just as great on that screen as they were in person.
p370
aVBut death is inevitable.
p371
aa(lp372
VI spoke some time ago to
p373
aVa joint session of Congress, last year.
p374
aVAnd we were meeting in that room,
p375
aVthe statue room.
p376
aVAbout 300 of them were there.
p377
aVAnd I said, "There's one thing that we have in common in this room,
p378
aVall of us together, whether Republican or Democrat,
p379
aVor whoever."
p380
aVI said, "We're all going to die.
p381
aVAnd we have that in common with all these great men of the past
p382
aVthat are staring down at us."
p383
aVAnd it's often difficult for young people
p384
aVto understand that.
p385
aVIt's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die.
p386
aVAs the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote,
p387
aVhe said, there's every activity under heaven.
p388
aVThere's a time to be born,
p389
aVand there's a time to die.
p390
aVI've stood at the deathbed
p391
aVof several famous people,
p392
aVwhom you would know.
p393
aVI've talked to them.
p394
aVI've seen them in those agonizing moments
p395
aVwhen they were scared to death.
p396
aa(lp397
VAnd yet, a few years earlier,
p398
aVdeath never crossed their mind.
p399
aVI talked to a woman this past week
p400
aVwhose father
p401
aVwas a famous doctor.
p402
aVShe said he never thought of God, never talked about God,
p403
aVdidn't believe in God. He was an atheist.
p404
aVBut she said,
p405
aVas he came to die,
p406
aVhe sat up on the side of the bed one day,
p407
aVand he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain.
p408
aVAnd he said, for the first time in his life
p409
aVhe'd thought about the inevitable,
p410
aVand about God.
p411
aVWas there a God?
p412
aVA few years ago, a university student asked me,
p413
aV"What is the greatest surprise in your life?"
p414
aVAnd I said, "The greatest surprise in my life
p415
aVis the brevity of life.
p416
aVIt passes so fast."
p417
aVBut it does not need to have to be that way.
p418
aVWernher von Braun,
p419
aVin the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote:
p420
aV"science and religion are not antagonists.
p421
aVOn the contrary, they're sisters."
p422
aVHe put it on a personal basis.
p423
aVI knew Dr. von Braun very well.
p424
aVAnd he said, "Speaking for myself,
p425
aVI can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos
p426
aVserves only to confirm
p427
aVa belief in the certainty of a creator."
p428
aVHe also said,
p429
aV"In our search to know God,
p430
aVI've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ
p431
aVshould be the focus of our efforts and inspiration.
p432
aVThe reality of this life and His resurrection
p433
aVis the hope of mankind."
p434
aa(lp435
VI've done a lot of speaking in Germany
p436
aVand in France, and in different parts of the world \u2014
p437
aV105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in.
p438
aVAnd I was invited one day to visit
p439
aVChancellor Adenauer,
p440
aVwho was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany,
p441
aVsince the war.
p442
aVAnd he once \u2014 and he said to me,
p443
aVhe said, "Young man." He said,
p444
aV"Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?"
p445
aVAnd I said, "Sir, I do."
p446
aVHe said, "So do I."
p447
aVHe said, "When I leave office,
p448
aVI'm going to spend my time writing a book
p449
aVon why Jesus Christ rose again,
p450
aVand why it's so important to believe that."
p451
aVIn one of his plays,
p452
aVAlexander Solzhenitsyn
p453
aVdepicts a man dying,
p454
aVwho says to those gathered around his bed,
p455
aV"The moment when it's terrible to feel regret
p456
aVis when one is dying."
p457
aVHow should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying?
p458
aa(lp459
VBlaise Pascal
p460
aVasked exactly that question
p461
aVin seventeenth-century France.
p462
aVPascal has been called the architect
p463
aVof modern civilization.
p464
aVHe was a brilliant scientist
p465
aVat the frontiers of mathematics,
p466
aVeven as a teenager.
p467
aVHe is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory,
p468
aVand a creator of the first model of a computer.
p469
aVAnd of course, you are all familiar with
p470
aVthe computer language named for him.
p471
aVPascal explored in depth our human dilemmas
p472
aVof evil, suffering and death.
p473
aVHe was astounded
p474
aVat the phenomenon we've been considering:
p475
aVthat people can achieve extraordinary heights
p476
aVin science, the arts and human enterprise,
p477
aVyet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy
p478
aVand have \u2014 and self-hatreds.
p479
aVPascal saw us as a remarkable mixture
p480
aVof genius and self-delusion.
p481
aVOn November 23,
p482
aV1654,
p483
aVPascal had a profound religious experience.
p484
aVHe wrote in his journal these words:
p485
aV"I submit myself,
p486
aVabsolutely,
p487
aVto Jesus Christ, my redeemer."

aa(lp489
VA French historian said,
p490
aVtwo centuries later,
p491
aV"Seldom has so mighty an intellect
p492
aVsubmitted with such humility
p493
aVto the authority of Jesus Christ."
p494
aVPascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God
p495
aVcould bring us back into harmony,
p496
aVbut he believed
p497
aVthat his own sins and failures could be forgiven,
p498
aVand that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.
p499
aVHe experienced it in a way that went beyond
p500
aVscientific observation and reason.
p501
aVIt was he who penned the well-known words,
p502
aV"The heart has its reasons,
p503
aVwhich reason knows not of."
p504
aa(lp505
VEqually well known is Pascal's Wager.
p506
aVEssentially, he said this: "if you bet on God,
p507
aVand open yourself to his love,
p508
aVyou lose nothing, even if you're wrong.
p509
aVBut if instead you bet that there is no God,
p510
aVthen you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come."
p511
aVFor Pascal, scientific knowledge
p512
aVpaled beside the knowledge of God.
p513
aVThe knowledge of God was far beyond
p514
aVanything that ever crossed his mind.
p515
aVHe was ready to face him
p516
aVwhen he died at the age of 39.
p517
aVKing David lived to be 70,
p518
aVa long time in his era.
p519
aVYet he too had to face death,
p520
aVand he wrote these words:
p521
aV"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
p522
aVI will fear no evil,
p523
aVfor you are with me."
p524
aa(lp525
VThis was David's answer to three dilemmas
p526
aVof evil, suffering and death.
p527
aVIt can be yours, as well,
p528
aVas you seek the living God
p529
aVand allow him to fill your life
p530
aVand give you hope for the future.
p531
aVWhen I was 17 years of age,
p532
aVI was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.
p533
aVI milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening
p534
aVwhen I came home from school.
p535
aVAnd there were 20 of them that I had \u2014
p536
aVthat I was responsible for,
p537
aVand I worked on the farm
p538
aVand tried to keep up with my studies.
p539
aVI didn't make good grades in high school.
p540
aVI didn't make them in college, until
p541
aVsomething happened in my heart.
p542
aa(lp543
VOne day, I was faced face-to-face
p544
aVwith Christ.
p545
aVHe said, "I am the way, the truth and the life."
p546
aVCan you imagine that? "I am the truth.
p547
aVI'm the embodiment of all truth."
p548
aVHe was a liar.
p549
aVOr he was insane.
p550
aVOr he was what he claimed to be.
p551
aVWhich was he?
p552
aVI had to make that decision.
p553
aVI couldn't prove it.
p554
aVI couldn't take it to a laboratory
p555
aVand experiment with it.
p556
aVBut by faith I said, I believe him,
p557
aVand he came into my heart
p558
aVand changed my life.
p559
aVAnd now I'm ready,
p560
aVwhen I hear that call,
p561
aVto go into the presence of God.
p562
aVThank you, and God bless all of you.
p563
aa(lp564
V(Applause)
p565
aa(lp566
VThank you for the privilege. It was great.

VToday I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.
p5
aVAnd the problem I'm going to talk about
p6
aVis not the familiar one from philosophy,
p7
aVwhich is, "How can we know
p8
aVwhether other people have minds?"
p9
aVThat is, maybe you have a mind,
p10
aVand everyone else is just a really convincing robot.
p11
aVSo that's a problem in philosophy,
p12
aVbut for today's purposes I'm going to assume
p13
aVthat many people in this audience have a mind,
p14
aVand that I don't have to worry about this.
p15
aa(lp16
VThere is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us
p17
aVas parents and teachers and spouses
p18
aVand novelists,
p19
aVwhich is, "Why is it so hard
p20
aVto know what somebody else wants or believes?"
p21
aVOr perhaps, more relevantly,
p22
aV"Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?"
p23
aa(lp24
VI think novelists put this best.
p25
aVLike Philip Roth, who said,
p26
aV"And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business
p27
aVof other people?
p28
aVSo ill equipped are we all,
p29
aVto envision one another's interior workings
p30
aVand invisible aims."
p31
aVSo as a teacher and as a spouse,
p32
aVthis is, of course, a problem I confront every day.
p33
aVBut as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds,
p34
aVand that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today.
p35
aVAnd that problem is, "How is it so easy
p36
aVto know other minds?"
p37
aa(lp38
VSo to start with an illustration,
p39
aVyou need almost no information,
p40
aVone snapshot of a stranger,
p41
aVto guess what this woman is thinking,
p42
aVor what this man is.
p43
aVAnd put another way, the crux of the problem is
p44
aVthe machine that we use for thinking about other minds,
p45
aVour brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells,
p46
aVthat we share with all other animals, with monkeys
p47
aVand mice and even sea slugs.
p48
aVAnd yet, you put them together in a particular network,
p49
aVand what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.
p50
aVOr to say, as Alan Greenspan did,
p51
aV"I know you think you understand what you thought I said,
p52
aVbut I'm not sure you realize that what you heard
p53
aVis not what I meant."
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VSo, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience
p57
aVis to stand with these ideas,
p58
aVone in each hand.
p59
aVAnd to try to understand how you can put together
p60
aVsimple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network,
p61
aVand get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.
p62
aVSo I'm going to tell you three things about this today.
p63
aVObviously the whole project here is huge.
p64
aVAnd I'm going to tell you just our first few steps
p65
aVabout the discovery of a special brain region
p66
aVfor thinking about other people's thoughts.
p67
aVSome observations on the slow development of this system
p68
aVas we learn how to do this difficult job.
p69
aVAnd then finally, to show that some of the differences
p70
aVbetween people, in how we judge others,
p71
aVcan be explained by differences in this brain system.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo first, the first thing I want to tell you is that
p74
aVthere is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains,
p75
aVwhose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.
p76
aVThis is a picture of it.
p77
aVIt's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.
p78
aVIt's above and behind your right ear.
p79
aVAnd this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you,
p80
aVor when you read Romeo and Juliet
p81
aVor when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.
p82
aVAnd you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.
p83
aVSo this brain region is called the Right TPJ.
p84
aVAnd this picture shows the average activation
p85
aVin a group of what we call typical human adults.
p86
aVThey're MIT undergraduates.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VThe second thing I want to say about this brain system
p90
aVis that although we human adults
p91
aVare really good at understanding other minds,
p92
aVwe weren't always that way.
p93
aVIt takes children a long time to break into the system.
p94
aVI'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process.
p95
aVThe first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five,
p96
aVas kids learn to understand
p97
aVthat somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own.
p98
aVSo I'm going to show you a five-year-old
p99
aVwho is getting a standard kind of puzzle
p100
aVthat we call the false belief task.
p101
aa(lp102
VRebecca Saxe (Video): This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan.
p103
aVAnd you know what pirates really like?
p104
aa(lp105
VChild: What? RS: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches.
p106
aa(lp107
VChild: Cheese? I love cheese!
p108
aa(lp109
VRS: Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich,
p110
aVand he says, "Yum yum yum yum yum!
p111
aVI really love cheese sandwiches."
p112
aVAnd Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.
p113
aVAnd Ivan says, "You know what? I need a drink with my lunch."
p114
aVAnd so Ivan goes to get a drink.
p115
aVAnd while Ivan is away
p116
aVthe wind comes,
p117
aVand it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.
p118
aVAnd now, here comes the other pirate.
p119
aVThis pirate is called Joshua.
p120
aVAnd Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.
p121
aVSo Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says,
p122
aV"Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches."
p123
aVAnd he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest.
p124
aa(lp125
VChild: So, that one is his.
p126
aa(lp127
VRS: That one is Joshua's. That's right.
p128
aa(lp129
VChild: And then his went on the ground.
p130
aa(lp131
VRS: That's exactly right.
p132
aa(lp133
VChild: So he won't know which one is his.
p134
aa(lp135
VRS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.
p136
aVIvan comes back and he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
p137
aVSo which one do you think Ivan is going to take?
p138
aa(lp139
VChild: I think he is going to take that one.
p140
aa(lp141
VRS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see.
p142
aVOh yeah, you were right. He took that one.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo that's a five-year-old who clearly understands
p145
aVthat other people can have false beliefs
p146
aVand what the consequences are for their actions.
p147
aVNow I'm going to show you a three-year-old
p148
aVwho got the same puzzle.
p149
aa(lp150
VRS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
p151
aVWhich sandwich is he going to take?
p152
aVDo you think he's going to take that one? Let's see what happens.
p153
aVLet's see what he does. Here comes Ivan.
p154
aVAnd he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
p155
aVAnd he takes this one.
p156
aVUh-oh. Why did he take that one?
p157
aa(lp158
VChild: His was on the grass.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo the three-year-old does two things differently.
p161
aVFirst, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich
p162
aVthat's really his.
p163
aVAnd second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his,
p164
aVwhere we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his,
p165
aVthe three-year-old comes up with another explanation:
p166
aVHe's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it,
p167
aVbecause now it's dirty, on the ground.
p168
aVSo that's why he's taking the other sandwich.
p169
aVNow of course, development doesn't end at five.
p170
aVAnd we can see the continuation of this process
p171
aVof learning to think about other people's thoughts
p172
aVby upping the ante
p173
aVand asking children now, not for an action prediction,
p174
aVbut for a moral judgment.
p175
aVSo first I'm going to show you the three-year-old again.
p176
aa(lp177
VRS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich?
p178
aa(lp179
VChild: Yeah.
p180
aa(lp181
VRS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?
p182
aa(lp183
VChild: Yeah.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan
p186
aVto take Joshua's sandwich,
p187
aVsince he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich
p188
aVto avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.
p189
aVBut now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.
p190
aVRemember the five-year-old completely understood
p191
aVwhy Ivan took Joshua's sandwich.
p192
aa(lp193
VRS: Was Ivan being mean and naughty
p194
aVfor taking Joshua's sandwich?
p195
aa(lp196
VChild: Um, yeah.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd so, it is not until age seven
p199
aVthat we get what looks more like an adult response.
p200
aa(lp201
VRS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?
p202
aa(lp203
VChild: No, because the wind should get in trouble.
p204
aa(lp205
VHe says the wind should get in trouble
p206
aVfor switching the sandwiches.
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd now what we've started to do in my lab
p210
aVis to put children into the brain scanner
p211
aVand ask what's going on in their brain
p212
aVas they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.
p213
aVSo the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ,
p214
aVbeing used while children are thinking about other people.
p215
aVBut it's not quite like the adult brain.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo whereas in the adults, as I told you,
p218
aVthis brain region is almost completely specialized \u2014
p219
aVit does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts \u2014
p220
aVin children it's much less so,
p221
aVwhen they are age five to eight,
p222
aVthe age range of the children I just showed you.
p223
aVAnd actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds,
p224
aVgetting into early adolescence,
p225
aVthey still don't have quite an adult-like brain region.
p226
aVAnd so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood
p227
aVand even into adolescence,
p228
aVboth the cognitive system,
p229
aVour mind's ability to think about other minds,
p230
aVand the brain system that supports it
p231
aVare continuing, slowly, to develop.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut of course, as you're probably aware,
p234
aVeven in adulthood,
p235
aVpeople differ from one another in how good they are
p236
aVat thinking of other minds, how often they do it
p237
aVand how accurately.
p238
aVAnd so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults
p239
aVin how they think about other people's thoughts
p240
aVbe explained in terms of differences in this brain region?
p241
aVSo, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version
p242
aVof the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.
p243
aVAnd I'm going to give that to you now.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory,
p246
aVand they take a break for coffee.
p247
aVAnd Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee.
p248
aVGrace goes to make the coffee
p249
aVand finds by the coffee a pot
p250
aVcontaining a white powder, which is sugar.
p251
aVBut the powder is labeled "Deadly Poison,"
p252
aVso Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.
p253
aVAnd she puts it in her friend's coffee.
p254
aVAnd her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.
p255
aa(lp256
VHow many people think it was morally permissible
p257
aVfor Grace to put the powder in the coffee?
p258
aVOkay. Good. (Laughter)
p259
aVSo we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed
p260
aVin this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd we can compare that to another case,
p263
aVwhere everything in the real world is the same.
p264
aVThe powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.
p265
aVNow she thinks the powder is sugar.
p266
aVAnd perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar
p267
aVand puts it in her friend's coffee,
p268
aVpeople say she deserves no blame at all.
p269
aVWhereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar,
p270
aVnow people say she deserves a lot of blame,
p271
aVeven though what happened in the real world was exactly the same.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd in fact, they say she deserves more blame
p274
aVin this case, the failed attempt to harm,
p275
aVthan in another case,
p276
aVwhich we call an accident.
p277
aVWhere Grace thought the powder was sugar,
p278
aVbecause it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine,
p279
aVbut actually the powder was poison.
p280
aVSo even though when the powder was poison,
p281
aVthe friend drank the coffee and died,
p282
aVpeople say Grace deserves less blame in that case,
p283
aVwhen she innocently thought it was sugar,
p284
aVthan in the other case, where she thought it was poison
p285
aVand no harm occurred.
p286
aa(lp287
VPeople, though, disagree a little bit
p288
aVabout exactly how much blame Grace should get
p289
aVin the accident case.
p290
aVSome people think she should deserve more blame,
p291
aVand other people less.
p292
aVAnd what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside
p293
aVthe brains of people while they're making that judgment.
p294
aVSo what I'm showing you, from left to right,
p295
aVis how much activity there was in this brain region,
p296
aVand from top to bottom, how much blame
p297
aVpeople said that Grace deserved.
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd what you can see is, on the left
p300
aVwhen there was very little activity in this brain region,
p301
aVpeople paid little attention to her innocent belief
p302
aVand said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident.
p303
aVWhereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity,
p304
aVpeople paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief,
p305
aVand said she deserved a lot less blame
p306
aVfor causing the accident.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo that's good, but of course
p309
aVwhat we'd rather is have a way to interfere
p310
aVwith function in this brain region,
p311
aVand see if we could change people's moral judgment.
p312
aVAnd we do have such a tool.
p313
aVIt's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation,
p314
aVor TMS.
p315
aVThis is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse
p316
aVthrough somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain,
p317
aVand temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo I'm going to show you a demo of this.
p320
aVFirst, I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse.
p321
aVI'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine.
p322
aVWhen you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.
p323
aVSo now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain,
p324
aVto the part of my brain that controls my hand.
p325
aVSo there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse.
p326
aa(lp327
VWoman (Video): Ready, Rebecca? RS: Yes.
p328
aa(lp329
VOkay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand
p330
aVby putting a magnetic pulse in my brain.
p331
aVAnd we can use that same pulse,
p332
aVnow applied to the RTPJ,
p333
aVto ask if we can change people's moral judgments.
p334
aVSo these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments.
p335
aVAnd then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ
p336
aVand ask how people's judgments change.
p337
aVAnd the first thing is, people can still do this task overall.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo their judgments of the case when everything was fine
p340
aVremain the same. They say she deserves no blame.
p341
aVBut in the case of a failed attempt to harm,
p342
aVwhere Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar,
p343
aVpeople now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame
p344
aVfor putting the powder in the coffee.
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar,
p347
aVbut it was really poison and so she caused a death,
p348
aVpeople say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame.
p349
aVSo what I've told you today is that
p350
aVpeople come, actually, especially well equipped
p351
aVto think about other people's thoughts.
p352
aa(lp353
VWe have a special brain system
p354
aVthat lets us think about what other people are thinking.
p355
aVThis system takes a long time to develop,
p356
aVslowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.
p357
aVAnd even in adulthood, differences in this brain region
p358
aVcan explain differences among adults
p359
aVin how we think about and judge other people.
p360
aa(lp361
VBut I want to give the last word back to the novelists,
p362
aVand to Philip Roth, who ended by saying,
p363
aV"The fact remains that getting people right
p364
aVis not what living is all about anyway.
p365
aVIt's getting them wrong that is living.
p366
aVGetting them wrong and wrong and wrong,
p367
aVand then on careful reconsideration,
p368
aVgetting them wrong again."
p369
aVThank you.
p370
aV(Applause)
p371
aa(lp372
VChris Anderson: So, I have a question. When you start talking about using
p373
aVmagnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments,
p374
aVthat sounds alarming.
p375
aV(Laughter)
p376
aVPlease tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say.
p377
aa(lp378
VRS: I'm not.
p379
aVI mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call.
p380
aV(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
VCA: They really are calling?
p383
aVSo then seriously,
p384
aVyou must lie awake at night sometimes
p385
aVwondering where this work leads.
p386
aVI mean, you're clearly an incredible human being,
p387
aVbut someone could take this knowledge
p388
aVand in some future
p389
aVnot-torture chamber,
p390
aVdo acts that people here might be worried about.
p391
aa(lp392
VRS: Yeah, we worry about this.
p393
aVSo, there's a couple of things to say about TMS.
p394
aVOne is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it.
p395
aVSo it's not a surreptitious technology.
p396
aVIt's quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes.
p397
aVThe changes I showed you are impressive to me
p398
aVbecause of what they tell us about the function of the brain,
p399
aVbut they're small on the scale
p400
aVof the moral judgments that we actually make.
p401
aa(lp402
VAnd what we changed was not people's
p403
aVmoral judgments when they're deciding what to do,
p404
aVwhen they're making action choices.
p405
aVWe changed their ability to judge other people's actions.
p406
aVAnd so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as
p407
aVstudying the defendant in a criminal trial,
p408
aVbut studying the jury.
p409
aa(lp410
VCA: Is your work going to lead to any recommendations
p411
aVin education, to perhaps bring up
p412
aVa generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments?
p413
aa(lp414
VRS: That's one of the idealistic hopes.
p415
aVThe whole research program here of studying
p416
aVthe distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.
p417
aVUntil recently, what we knew about the brain
p418
aVwere the things that any other animal's brain could do too,
p419
aVso we could study it in animal models.
p420
aVWe knew how brains see, and how they control the body
p421
aVand how they hear and sense.
p422
aVAnd the whole project of understanding
p423
aVhow brains do the uniquely human things \u2014
p424
aVlearn language and abstract concepts,
p425
aVand thinking about other people's thoughts \u2014 that's brand new.
p426
aVAnd we don't know yet what the implications will be
p427
aVof understanding it.
p428
aa(lp429
VCA: So I've got one last question. There is this thing called
p430
aVthe hard problem of consciousness,
p431
aVthat puzzles a lot of people.
p432
aVThe notion that you can understand
p433
aVwhy a brain works, perhaps.
p434
aVBut why does anyone have to feel anything?
p435
aVWhy does it seem to require these beings who sense things
p436
aVfor us to operate?
p437
aVYou're a brilliant young neuroscientist.
p438
aVI mean, what chances do you think there are
p439
aVthat at some time in your career,
p440
aVsomeone, you or someone else,
p441
aVis going to come up with some paradigm shift
p442
aVin understanding what seems an impossible problem?
p443
aa(lp444
VRS: I hope they do. And I think they probably won't.
p445
aa(lp446
VCA: Why?
p447
aa(lp448
VRS: It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing.
p449
aV(Laughter)
p450
aa(lp451
VCA: That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic.

VIn two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary
p5
aVof the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed "Jeopardy" set.
p6
aVI mean, nine years is a long time.
p7
aVAnd given "Jeopardy's" average demographics,
p8
aVI think what that means
p9
aVis most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVBut not all, a few are still alive.
p12
aVOccasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.
p13
aVAnd when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.
p14
aVI think that ship has sailed, it's too late for me.
p15
aVFor better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as,
p16
aVas the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd I can't complain about this.
p19
aVI feel like that was always sort of my destiny,
p20
aValthough I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet.
p21
aVIf nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager,
p22
aVit is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVAnd as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years.
p25
aVBut if you go further back, if you look at it, it's all there.
p26
aVI was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad
p27
aVwith whatever great fact I had just read about \u2014
p28
aVHaley's comet or giant squids
p29
aVor the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.
p30
aVI now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.
p31
aVAnd I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows.
p35
aVI remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979
p36
aVbecause it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school,
p37
aVthat I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud."
p38
aVI was going to miss my game shows.
p39
aVAnd later, in the mid-'80s,
p40
aVwhen "Jeopardy" came back on the air,
p41
aVI remember running home from school every day to watch the show.
p42
aVIt was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.
p43
aVAnd we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working,
p44
aVwhere there was only one English language TV channel.
p45
aVThere was Armed Forces TV,
p46
aVand if you didn't speak Korean, that's what you were watching.
p47
aVSo me and all my friends would run home every day and watch "Jeopardy."
p48
aa(lp49
VI was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.
p50
aVI remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s
p51
aVand holding my own, back when that was a fad.
p52
aVThere's a weird sense of mastery you get
p53
aVwhen you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know.
p54
aVYou know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know.
p55
aVAnd you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power \u2014
p56
aVthe right fact deployed at exactly the right place.
p57
aa(lp58
VI never had a guidance counselor
p59
aVwho thought this was a legitimate career path,
p60
aVthat thought you could major in trivia
p61
aVor be a professional ex-game show contestant.
p62
aVAnd so I sold out way too young.
p63
aVI didn't try to figure out what one does with that.
p64
aVI studied computers because I heard that was the thing,
p65
aVand I became a computer programmer \u2014
p66
aVnot an especially good one,
p67
aVnot an especially happy one at the time when I was first on "Jeopardy" in 2004.
p68
aVBut that's what I was doing.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd it made it doubly ironic \u2014 my computer background \u2014
p71
aVa few years later, I think 2009 or so,
p72
aVwhen I got another phone call from "Jeopardy" saying,
p73
aV"It's early days yet, but IBM tells us
p74
aVthey want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.'
p75
aVAre you up for this?"
p76
aVThis was the first I'd heard of it.
p77
aVAnd of course I said yes, for several reasons.
p78
aVOne, because playing "Jeopardy" is a great time.
p79
aVIt's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVAnd I would do it for nothing.
p82
aVI don't think they know that, luckily,
p83
aVbut I would go back and play for Arby's coupons.
p84
aVI just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.
p85
aVAnd second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.
p86
aVPeople playing computers on game shows
p87
aVwas the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future,
p88
aVand now I could be on the stage with it.
p89
aVI was not going to say no.
p90
aa(lp91
VThe third reason I said yes
p92
aVis because I was pretty confident that I was going to win.
p93
aVI had taken some artificial intelligence classes.
p94
aVI knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on "Jeopardy."
p95
aVPeople don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program
p96
aVthat can read a "Jeopardy" clue in a natural language like English
p97
aVand understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings,
p98
aVunpack the meaning of the clue.
p99
aVThe kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do,
p100
aVvery hard for a computer.
p101
aVAnd I thought, well this is going to be child's play.
p102
aVYes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VBut as the years went on,
p106
aVas IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this,
p107
aVI started to get occasional updates from them,
p108
aVand I started to get a little more worried.
p109
aVI remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.
p110
aVIt was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy,"
p111
aVtens of thousands of dots representing "Jeopardy" champions up at the top
p112
aVwith their performance plotted on number of \u2014
p113
aVI was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess,
p114
aVclues responded to \u2014
p115
aVversus the accuracy of those answers.
p116
aVSo there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.
p117
aVAnd at first, it was very low.
p118
aVThere was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.
p119
aVBut then you see the line start to go up.
p120
aVAnd it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.
p121
aVAnd I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart
p122
aVsome darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.
p123
aVAnd thought, what are these?
p124
aV"The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings."
p125
aVAnd I saw this line coming for me.
p126
aVAnd I realized, this is it.
p127
aVThis is what it looks like when the future comes for you.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVIt's not the Terminator's gun sight;
p130
aVit's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do,
p131
aVthe only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd when the game eventually happened about a year later,
p134
aVit was very different than the "Jeopardy" games I'd been used to.
p135
aVWe were not playing in L.A. on the regular "Jeopardy" set.
p136
aVWatson does not travel.
p137
aVWatson's actually huge.
p138
aVIt's thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory,
p139
aVtrillions of bytes of memory.
p140
aVWe got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.
p141
aVThe only other "Jeopardy" contestant to this day I've ever been inside.
p142
aVAnd so Watson does not travel.
p143
aVYou must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo me and the other human player
p146
aVwound up at this secret IBM research lab
p147
aVin the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County
p148
aVto play the computer.
p149
aVAnd we realized right away
p150
aVthat the computer had a big home court advantage.
p151
aVThere was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.
p152
aVLike you're going to play the Chicago Bulls,
p153
aVand there's the thing in the middle of their court.
p154
aVAnd the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers
p155
aVcheering on their little darling,
p156
aVhaving poured millions of dollars into this
p157
aVhoping against hope that the humans screw up,
p158
aVand holding up "Go Watson" signs
p159
aVand just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right.
p160
aVI think guys had "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their bellies in grease paint.
p161
aVIf you can imagine computer programmers with the letters "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their gut,
p162
aVit's an unpleasant sight.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut they were right. They were exactly right.
p165
aVI don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR,
p166
aVbut Watson won handily.
p167
aVAnd I remember standing there behind the podium
p168
aVas I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking.
p169
aVIt had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.
p170
aVAnd you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick.
p171
aVAnd I remember thinking, this is it.
p172
aVI felt obsolete.
p173
aVI felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s
p174
aVseeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.
p175
aVI felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete
p176
aVunder this new regime of thinking computers.
p177
aVAnd it hasn't been the last.
p178
aa(lp179
VIf you watch the news, you'll see occasionally \u2014
p180
aVand I see this all the time \u2014
p181
aVthat pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically
p182
aVwithout actually needing a human pharmacist.
p183
aVAnd a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals
p184
aVbecause there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.
p185
aVYou don't need human assistants for that anymore.
p186
aVI read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score
p187
aVfrom a baseball or football game
p188
aVand it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game
p189
aVand was commenting on it.
p190
aVAnd obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job
p191
aVas the humans they're replacing,
p192
aVbut they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper.
p193
aVSo it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.
p194
aVI've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies,
p195
aVwe'll enter a new golden age of leisure
p196
aVwhen we'll all have time for the things we really love
p197
aVbecause all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.
p198
aVI've heard other people say quite the opposite,
p199
aVthat this is yet another tier of the middle class
p200
aVthat's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology
p201
aVand that this is actually something ominous,
p202
aVsomething that we should worry about.
p203
aa(lp204
VI'm not an economist myself.
p205
aVAll I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.
p206
aVAnd it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible.
p207
aVHere's the one thing that I was ever good at,
p208
aVand all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people
p209
aVand thousands of processors working in parallel
p210
aVand they could do the same thing.
p211
aVThey could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV,
p212
aVand "I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore."
p213
aVAnd it made me think, what does this mean,
p214
aVif we're going to be able to start outsourcing,
p215
aVnot just lower unimportant brain functions.
p216
aVI'm sure many of you remember a distant time
p217
aVwhen we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers.
p218
aVAnd suddenly there was a machine that did that,
p219
aVand now we don't need to remember that anymore.
p220
aVI have read that there's now actually evidence
p221
aVthat the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships,
p222
aVphysically shrinks and atrophies
p223
aVin people who use tools like GPS,
p224
aVbecause we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore.
p225
aVWe're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard.
p226
aVAnd as a result, a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff
p227
aVgets smaller and dumber.
p228
aVAnd it made me think, what happens when computers are now better
p229
aVat knowing and remembering stuff than we are?
p230
aVIs all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?
p231
aVAre we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?
p232
aVAs somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know,
p233
aVthis was a terrifying idea to me.
p234
aa(lp235
VThe more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important.
p236
aVThe things we know are still important.
p237
aVI came to believe there were two advantages
p238
aVthat those of us who have these things in our head have
p239
aVover somebody who says, "Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second."
p240
aVThere's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time.
p241
aa(lp242
VThe advantage of volume, first,
p243
aVjust has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.
p244
aVThere's so much information out there.
p245
aVBeing a Renaissance man or woman,
p246
aVthat's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.
p247
aVNow it's really not possible
p248
aVto be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.
p249
aVThere's just too much.
p250
aVThey say that the scope of human information
p251
aVis now doubling every 18 months or so,
p252
aVthe sum total of human information.
p253
aVThat means between now and late 2014,
p254
aVwe will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes,
p255
aVas all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.
p256
aVIt's doubling every 18 months now.
p257
aVThis is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make
p258
aVrequire the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.
p259
aVA decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in?
p260
aVWho do I vote for?
p261
aVDo I take this job or that one?
p262
aVThese are the decisions that require correct judgments
p263
aVabout many different kinds of facts.
p264
aVIf we have those facts at our mental fingertips,
p265
aVwe're going to be able to make informed decisions.
p266
aVIf, on the other hand, we need to look them all up,
p267
aVwe may be in trouble.
p268
aVAccording to a National Geographic survey I just saw,
p269
aVsomewhere along the lines of 80 percent
p270
aVof the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy
p271
aVcannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map.
p272
aVIf you can't do that first step,
p273
aVare you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know
p274
aVto master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy?
p275
aVQuite probably not.
p276
aVAt some point you're just going to be like,
p277
aV"You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it."
p278
aVAnd you'll make a less informed decision.
p279
aa(lp280
VThe other issue is the advantage of time that you have
p281
aVif you have all these things at your fingertips.
p282
aVI always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.
p283
aVShe was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England
p284
aVon vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand.
p285
aVShe runs up to them on the beach one morning
p286
aVand says, "Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach."
p287
aVAnd they say, "What do you mean? We just got here."
p288
aVAnd she said, "In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month,
p289
aVhe told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea
p290
aVand you see the waves churning way out there,
p291
aVthat's the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach."
p292
aVWhat would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this?
p293
aVHer parents thought about it,
p294
aVand they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.
p295
aVThey told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel,
p296
aVand the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily,
p297
aVbecause that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami,
p298
aVthe day after Christmas, 2004,
p299
aVthat killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.
p300
aVBut not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach,
p301
aVbecause this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow when facts come in handy like that \u2014
p304
aVI love that story because it shows you the power of one fact,
p305
aVone remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time \u2014
p306
aVnormally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.
p307
aVBut in this case it happened in real life.
p308
aVAnd it happens in real life all the time.
p309
aVIt's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.
p310
aVIt's a meeting or job interview or first date
p311
aVor some relationship that gets lubricated
p312
aVbecause two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.
p313
aVYou say where you're from, and I say, "Oh, yeah."
p314
aVOr your alma mater or your job,
p315
aVand I know just a little something about it,
p316
aVenough to get the ball rolling.
p317
aVPeople love that shared connection that gets created
p318
aVwhen somebody knows something about you.
p319
aVIt's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met.
p320
aVThat's often the advantage of time.
p321
aVAnd it's not effective if you say, "Well, hold on.
p322
aVYou're from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up.
p323
aVOh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo."
p324
aVThat doesn't work. That's just annoying.
p325
aV(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
VThe great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson,
p328
aVSamuel Parr once said, "It's always better to know a thing than not to know it."
p329
aVAnd if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, it's probably that.
p330
aVI have always believed that the things we know \u2014 that knowledge is an absolute good,
p331
aVthat the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads
p332
aVare what make us who we are,
p333
aVas individuals and as a species.
p334
aVI don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.
p335
aVI don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced
p336
aVby these little bubbles of specialty,
p337
aVso that none of us know about the common associations
p338
aVthat used to bind our civilization together.
p339
aVI don't want to be the last trivia know-it-all
p340
aVsitting on a mountain somewhere,
p341
aVreciting to himself the state capitals and the names of "Simpsons" episodes
p342
aVand the lyrics of Abba songs.
p343
aVI feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share
p344
aVand that we know without having to outsource it to our devices,
p345
aVto our search engines and our smartphones.
p346
aa(lp347
VIn the movies, when computers like Watson start to think,
p348
aVthings don't always end well.
p349
aVThose movies are never about beautiful utopias.
p350
aVIt's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in "2001."
p351
aVThings always go terribly wrong.
p352
aVAnd I feel like we're sort of at the point now
p353
aVwhere we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in.
p354
aVThis is a question of leadership,
p355
aVbecause it becomes a question of who leads the future.
p356
aVOn the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age
p357
aVwhere information is more universally available
p358
aVthan it's ever been in human history,
p359
aVwhere we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.
p360
aVAnd on the other hand,
p361
aVwe have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia
p362
aVwhere the machines have taken over
p363
aVand we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore,
p364
aVthat knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud,
p365
aVand why would we ever bother learning anything new.
p366
aa(lp367
VThose are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in.
p368
aVAnd we can all make that choice.
p369
aVWe make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn,
p370
aVwho don't just say, "Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over,
p371
aVI don't have to learn anymore,"
p372
aVor "Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime.
p373
aVI don't have to learn new things anymore."
p374
aVNo, every day we should be striving to learn something new.
p375
aVWe should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.
p376
aVThat's where the people you see on "Jeopardy" come from.
p377
aVThese know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savants
p378
aVsitting at home memorizing the phone book.
p379
aVI've met a lot of them.
p380
aVFor the most part, they are just normal folks
p381
aVwho are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything,
p382
aVthirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject.
p383
aa(lp384
VWe can live in one of these two worlds.
p385
aVWe can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know,
p386
aVcontinue to be the thing that makes us special,
p387
aVor a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.
p388
aVLadies and gentlemen, the choice is yours.
p389
aa(lp390
VThank you very much.

VThis is a map of New York State
p5
aVthat was made in 1937 by the General Drafting Company.
p6
aVIt's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds,
p7
aVbecause down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains,
p8
aVthere is a little town called Roscoe \u2014
p9
aVactually, this will go easier if I just put it up here \u2014
p10
aVThere's Roscoe, and then right above Roscoe is Rockland, New York,
p11
aVand then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.
p12
aa(lp13
VAgloe, New York, is very famous to cartographers,
p14
aVbecause it's a paper town.
p15
aVIt's also known as a copyright trap.
p16
aVMapmakers \u2014 because my map of New York and your map of New York
p17
aVare going to look very similar, on account of the shape of New York \u2014
p18
aVoften, mapmakers will insert fake places onto their maps,
p19
aVin order to protect their copyright.
p20
aVBecause then, if my fake place shows up on your map,
p21
aVI can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me.
p22
aVAgloe is a scrabblization of the initials of the two guys who made this map,
p23
aVErnest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,
p24
aVand they released this map in 1937.
p25
aVDecades later, Rand McNally releases a map
p26
aVwith Agloe, New York, on it, at the same exact intersection
p27
aVof two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere.
p28
aVWell, you can imagine the delight over at General Drafting.
p29
aVThey immediately call Rand McNally, and they say,
p30
aV"We've caught you! We made Agloe, New York, up.
p31
aVIt is a fake place. It's a paper town.
p32
aVWe're going to sue your pants off!"
p33
aVAnd Rand McNally says, "No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."
p34
aVBecause people kept going to that intersection of two dirt roads \u2014
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
Vin the middle of nowhere, expecting there to be a place called Agloe \u2014
p39
aVsomeone built a place called Agloe, New York.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VIt had a gas station, a general store, two houses at its peak.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist,
p48
aVbecause we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper
p49
aVcan change the actual world in which we're actually living,
p50
aVwhich is why my third book is called "Paper Towns".
p51
aa(lp52
VBut what interests me ultimately more than the medium in which this happened,
p53
aVis the phenomenon itself.
p54
aVIt's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world, right?
p55
aVLike the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps.
p56
aVBut what I find a lot more interesting is the way
p57
aVthat the manner in which we map the world changes the world.
p58
aVBecause the world would truly be a different place if North were down.
p59
aVAnd the world would be a truly different place
p60
aVif Alaska and Russia weren't on opposite sides of the map.
p61
aVAnd the world would be a different place
p62
aVif we projected Europe to show it in its actual size.
p63
aVThe world is changed by our maps of the world.
p64
aVThe way that we choose \u2014 sort of, our personal cartographic enterprise,
p65
aValso shapes the map of our lives,
p66
aVand that in turn shapes our lives.
p67
aa(lp68
VI believe that what we map changes the life we lead.
p69
aVAnd I don't mean that in some, like, secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,
p70
aVyou-can-think-your-way- out-of-cancer sense.
p71
aVBut I do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life,
p72
aVthey show you where you might go.
p73
aVYou very rarely go to a place that isn't on your personal map.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo I was a really terrible student when I was a kid.
p76
aVMy GPA was consistently in the low 2s.
p77
aVAnd I think the reason that I was such a terrible student
p78
aVis that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles
p79
aVthat had been erected before me,
p80
aVand I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood.
p81
aVAnd I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles,
p82
aVbecause they seemed completely arbitrary, so I often wouldn't,
p83
aVand then people would threaten me, you know,
p84
aVthey'd threaten me with this "going on [my] permanent record,"
p85
aVor "You'll never get a good job."
p86
aVI didn't want a good job!
p87
aVAs far as I could tell at eleven or twelve years old,
p88
aVlike, people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning,
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
Vand the men who had good jobs, one of the first things they did
p93
aVwas tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks.
p94
aVThey literally put nooses on themselves,
p95
aVand then they went off to their jobs, whatever they were.
p96
aVThat's not a recipe for a happy life.
p97
aVThese people \u2014 in my, symbol-obsessed, twelve year-old imagination \u2014
p98
aVthese people who are strangling themselves
p99
aVas one of the first things they do each morning,
p100
aVthey can't possibly be happy.
p101
aVWhy would I want to jump over all of these hurdles
p102
aVand have that be the end?
p103
aVThat's a terrible end!
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd then, when I was in tenth grade, I went to this school,
p106
aVIndian Springs School, a small boarding school,
p107
aVoutside of Birmingham, Alabama.
p108
aVAnd all at once I became a learner.
p109
aVAnd I became a learner, because I found myself
p110
aVin a community of learners.
p111
aVI found myself surrounded by people
p112
aVwho celebrated intellectualism and engagement,
p113
aVand who thought that my ironic oh-so-cool disengagement
p114
aVwasn't clever, or funny,
p115
aVbut, like, it was a simple and unspectacular response
p116
aVto very complicated and compelling problems.
p117
aVAnd so I started to learn, because learning was cool.
p118
aVI learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets,
p119
aVand I learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears.
p120
aVI learned that the Civil War was a nationalizing conflict,
p121
aVI learned some physics,
p122
aVI learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation \u2014
p123
aVall of these things, by the way,
p124
aVenriched my life on a literally daily basis.
p125
aVAnd it's true that I don't use most of them for my "job,"
p126
aVbut that's not what it's about for me.
p127
aVIt's about cartography.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhat is the process of cartography?
p130
aVIt's, you know, sailing upon some land, and thinking,
p131
aV"I think I'll draw that bit of land,"
p132
aVand then wondering, "Maybe there's some more land to draw."
p133
aVAnd that's when learning really began for me.
p134
aVIt's true that I had teachers that didn't give up on me,
p135
aVand I was very fortunate to have those teachers,
p136
aVbecause I often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me.
p137
aVBut a lot of the learning that I did in high school
p138
aVwasn't about what happened inside the classroom,
p139
aVit was about what happened outside of the classroom.
p140
aVFor instance, I can tell you
p141
aVthat "There's a certain Slant of light, Winter Afternoons \u2014
p142
aVThat oppresses, like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes \u2014"
p143
aVnot because I memorized Emily Dickinson in school
p144
aVwhen I was in high school,
p145
aVbut because there was a girl when I was in high school,
p146
aVand her name was Amanda, and I had a crush on her,
p147
aVand she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.
p148
aVThe reason I can tell you what opportunity cost is,
p149
aVis because one day when I was playing Super Mario Kart on my couch,
p150
aVmy friend Emmet walked in, and he said,
p151
aV"How long have you been playing Super Mario Kart?"
p152
aVAnd I said, "I don't know, like, six hours?" and he said,
p153
aV"Do you realize that if you'd worked at Baskin-Robbins those six hours,
p154
aVyou could have made 30 dollars, so in some ways,
p155
aVyou just paid thirty dollars to play Super Mario Kart."
p156
aVAnd I was, like, "I'll take that deal."
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VBut I learned what opportunity cost is.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd along the way, the map of my life got better.
p163
aVIt got bigger; it contained more places.
p164
aVThere were more things that might happen,
p165
aVmore futures I might have.
p166
aVIt wasn't a formal, organized learning process,
p167
aVand I'm happy to admit that.
p168
aVIt was spotty, it was inconsistent, there was a lot I didn't know.
p169
aVI might know, you know, Cantor's idea
p170
aVthat some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets,
p171
aVbut I didn't really understand the calculus behind that idea.
p172
aVI might know the idea of opportunity cost,
p173
aVbut I didn't know the law of diminishing returns.
p174
aVBut the great thing about imagining learning as cartography,
p175
aVinstead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles
p176
aVthat you have to jump over,
p177
aVis that you see a bit of coastline, and that makes you want to see more.
p178
aVAnd so now I do know at least some of the calculus
p179
aVthat underlies all of that stuff.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo, I had one learning community
p182
aVin high school, then I went to another for college,
p183
aVand then I went to another,
p184
aVwhen I started working at a magazine called "Booklist,"
p185
aVwhere I was an assistant, surrounded by astonishingly well-read people.
p186
aVAnd then I wrote a book.
p187
aVAnd like all authors dream of doing,
p188
aVI promptly quit my job.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd for the first time since high school,
p193
aVI found myself without a learning community, and it was miserable.
p194
aVI hated it.
p195
aVI read many, many books during this two-year period.
p196
aVI read books about Stalin,
p197
aVand books about how the Uzbek people came to identify as Muslims,
p198
aVand I read books about how to make atomic bombs,
p199
aVbut it just felt like I was creating my own hurdles,
p200
aVand then jumping over them myself, instead of feeling the excitement
p201
aVof being part of a community of learners, a community of people
p202
aVwho are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise
p203
aVof trying to better understand and map the world around us.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd then, in 2006, I met that guy.
p206
aVHis name is Ze Frank.
p207
aVI didn't actually meet him, just on the Internet.
p208
aVZe Frank was running, at the time, a show called "The Show with Ze Frank,"
p209
aVand I discovered the show,
p210
aVand that was my way back into being a community learner again.
p211
aVHere's Ze talking about Las Vegas:
p212
aa(lp213
V(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built in the middle of a huge, hot desert.
p214
aVAlmost everything here was brought from somewhere else \u2014
p215
aVthe sort of rocks, the trees, the waterfalls.
p216
aVThese fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew.
p217
aVContrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place,
p218
aVso are these people.
p219
aVThings from all over the world have been rebuilt here, away from their histories,
p220
aVand away from the people that experience them differently.
p221
aVSometimes improvements were made \u2014 even the Sphinx got a nose job.
p222
aVHere, there's no reason to feel like you're missing anything.
p223
aVThis New York means the same to me as it does to everyone else.
p224
aVEverything is out of context, and that means context allows for everything:
p225
aVSelf Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.
p226
aVThis fabrication of place could be one of the world's greatest achievements,
p227
aVbecause no one belongs here; everyone does.
p228
aVAs I walked around this morning, I noticed most of the buildings
p229
aVwere huge mirrors reflecting the sun back into the desert.
p230
aVBut unlike most mirrors,
p231
aVwhich present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place,
p232
aVthese mirrors come back empty.
p233
aa(lp234
VJohn Green: Makes me nostalgic for the days
p235
aVwhen you could see the pixels in online video.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VZe isn't just a great public intellectual, he's also a brilliant community builder,
p240
aVand the community of people that built up around these videos
p241
aVwas in many ways a community of learners.
p242
aVSo we played Ze Frank at chess collaboratively, and we beat him.
p243
aVWe organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the United States.
p244
aVWe turned the Earth into a sandwich,
p245
aVby having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the Earth,
p246
aVand on the exact opposite point of the Earth,
p247
aVhave another person holding a piece of bread.
p248
aVI realize that these are silly ideas, but they are also "learny" ideas,
p249
aVand that was what was so exciting to me,
p250
aVand if you go online, you can find communities like this all over the place.
p251
aVFollow the calculus tag on Tumblr,
p252
aVand yes, you will see people complaining about calculus,
p253
aVbut you'll also see people re-blogging those complaints,
p254
aVmaking the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful,
p255
aVand here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable.
p256
aVYou can go to places like Reddit, and find sub-Reddits,
p257
aVlike "Ask a Historian" or "Ask Science,"
p258
aVwhere you can ask people who are in these fields
p259
aVa wide range of questions,
p260
aVfrom very serious ones to very silly ones.
p261
aVBut to me, the most interesting communities of learners
p262
aVthat are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube,
p263
aVand admittedly, I am biased.
p264
aVBut I think in a lot of ways, the YouTube page resembles a classroom.
p265
aVLook for instance at "Minute Physics,"
p266
aVa guy who's teaching the world about physics:
p267
aa(lp268
V(Video) Let's cut to the chase.
p269
aVAs of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece
p270
aVof the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally.
p271
aVBut, you might ask, why was the Higgs boson
p272
aVincluded in the standard model,
p273
aValongside well-known particles like electrons and photons and quarks,
p274
aVif it hadn't been discovered back then in the 1970s?
p275
aVGood question. There are two main reasons.
p276
aVFirst, just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field,
p277
aVthe Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation
p278
aVof the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.
p279
aVThe Higgs field in turn plays an integral role
p280
aVin our model for the weak nuclear force.
p281
aVIn particular, the Higgs field helps explain why it's so weak.
p282
aVWe'll talk more about this in a later video,
p283
aVbut even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,
p284
aVthe Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force, that until now
p285
aVwe've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence.
p286
aa(lp287
VJG: Or here's a video that I made
p288
aVas part of my show "Crash Course," talking about World War I:
p289
aa(lp290
V(Video) The immediate cause was of course the assassination in Sarajevo
p291
aVof the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
p292
aVon June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip.
p293
aVQuick aside: It's worth noting
p294
aVthat the first big war of the twentieth century began
p295
aVwith an act of terrorism.
p296
aVSo Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well-liked
p297
aVby his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph \u2014 now that is a mustache!
p298
aVBut even so, the assassination led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,
p299
aVwhereupon Serbia accepted some, but not all, of Austria's demands,
p300
aVleading Austria to declare war against Serbia.
p301
aVAnd then Russia, due to its alliance with the Serbs, mobilized its army.
p302
aVGermany, because it had an alliance with Austria,
p303
aVtold Russia to stop mobilizing,
p304
aVwhich Russia failed to do, so then Germany mobilized its own army,
p305
aVdeclared war on Russia, cemented an alliance with the Ottomans,
p306
aVand then declared war on France, because, you know, France.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd it's not just physics and world history
p311
aVthat people are choosing to learn through YouTube.
p312
aVHere's a video about abstract mathematics.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Video) So you're me, and you're in math class yet again,
p315
aVbecause they make you go every single day.
p316
aVAnd you're learning about, I don't know, the sums of infinite series.
p317
aVThat's a high school topic, right?
p318
aVWhich is odd, because it's a cool topic, but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.
p319
aVSo I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum.
p320
aVSo, in a quite understandable need for distraction, you're doodling
p321
aVand thinking more about what the plural of "series" should be
p322
aVthan about the topic at hand: "serieses," "seriese," "seriesen," and "serii?"
p323
aVOr is it that the singular should be changed: one "serie," or "serum,"
p324
aVjust like the singular of "sheep" should be "shoop."
p325
aVBut the whole concept of things
p326
aVlike 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on approaches one, is useful if, say,
p327
aVyou want to draw a line of elephants,
p328
aVeach holding the tail of the next one:
p329
aVnormal elephant, young elephant, baby elephant, dog-sized elephant,
p330
aVpuppy-sized elephant, all the way down to Mr. Tusks and beyond.
p331
aVWhich is at least a tiny bit awesome,
p332
aVbecause you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line,
p333
aVand still have it fit across a single notebook page.
p334
aa(lp335
VJG: And lastly, here's Destin, from "Smarter Every Day,"
p336
aVtalking about the conservation of angular momentum,
p337
aVand, since it's YouTube, cats:
p338
aa(lp339
V(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day."
p340
aVSo you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet.
p341
aVToday's question is: why?
p342
aVLike most simple questions, there's a very complex answer.
p343
aVFor instance, let me reword this question:
p344
aVHow does a cat go from feet-up to feet-down in a falling reference frame,
p345
aVwithout violating the conservation of angular momentum?
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VJG: So, here's something all four of these videos have in common:
p350
aVThey all have more than half a million views on YouTube.
p351
aVAnd those are people watching not in classrooms,
p352
aVbut because they are part of the communities of learning
p353
aVthat are being set up by these channels.
p354
aVAnd I said earlier that YouTube is like a classroom to me,
p355
aVand in many ways it is, because here is the instructor \u2014
p356
aVit's like the old-fashioned classroom: here's the instructor,
p357
aVand then beneath the instructor are the students,
p358
aVand they're all having a conversation.
p359
aVAnd I know that YouTube comments have a very bad reputation
p360
aVin the world of the Internet,
p361
aVbut in fact, if you go on comments for these channels,
p362
aVwhat you'll find is people engaging the subject matter,
p363
aVasking difficult, complicated questions that are about the subject matter,
p364
aVand then other people answering those questions.
p365
aVAnd because the YouTube page is set up so that the page in which I'm talking to you
p366
aVis on the exact \u2014 the place where I'm talking to you is on the exact same page
p367
aVas your comments,
p368
aVyou are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation.
p369
aVAnd because I'm in comments usually, I get to participate with you.
p370
aVAnd you find this whether it's world history,
p371
aVor mathematics, or science, or whatever it is.
p372
aa(lp373
VYou also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet
p374
aVin order to create places for intellectual engagement,
p375
aVinstead of the ironic detachment
p376
aVthat maybe most of us associate with memes and other Internet conventions \u2014
p377
aVyou know, "Got bored. Invented calculus."
p378
aVOr, here's Honey Boo Boo criticizing industrial capitalism:
p379
aa(lp380
V["Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity.
p381
aVQuite the contrary; it is the vehicle of savage, destructive nihilism."]
p382
aa(lp383
VIn case you can't see what she says ... yeah.
p384
aa(lp385
VI really believe that these spaces,
p386
aVthese communities, have become for a new generation of learners,
p387
aVthe kind of communities, the kind of cartographic communities
p388
aVthat I had when I was in high school, and then again when I was in college.
p389
aVAnd as an adult, re-finding these communities
p390
aVhas re-introduced me to a community of learners,
p391
aVand has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood,
p392
aVso that I no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young.
p393
aVVi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me
p394
aVto all kinds of things that I didn't know before.
p395
aVAnd I know that we all hearken back
p396
aVto the days of the Parisian salon in the Enlightenment,
p397
aVor to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,
p398
aV"Oh, I wish I could have been a part of that,
p399
aVI wish I could have laughed at Dorothy Parker's jokes."
p400
aVBut I'm here to tell you that these places exist, they still exist.
p401
aVThey exist in corners of the Internet, where old men fear to tread.
p402
aa(lp403
V(Laughter)
p404
aa(lp405
VAnd I truly, truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s,
p406
aVwhen we made Agloe real, we were just getting started.
p407
aa(lp408
VThank you.
p409

VHow can we investigate
p5
aVthis flora of viruses that surround us, and aid medicine?
p6
aVHow can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology
p7
aVinto a simple, hand-held, single diagnostic assay?
p8
aVI want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses
p9
aVand the spectrum of viruses that are out there
p10
aVinto, let's say, a small chip.
p11
aa(lp12
VWhen we started thinking about this project \u2014
p13
aVhow we would make a single diagnostic assay
p14
aVto screen for all pathogens simultaneously \u2014
p15
aVwell, there's some problems with this idea.
p16
aVFirst of all, viruses are pretty complex,
p17
aVbut they're also evolving very fast.
p18
aVThis is a picornavirus.
p19
aVPicornaviruses \u2014 these are things that include
p20
aVthe common cold and polio, things like this.
p21
aVYou're looking at the outside shell of the virus,
p22
aVand the yellow color here are those parts of the virus
p23
aVthat are evolving very, very fast,
p24
aVand the blue parts are not evolving very fast.
p25
aVWhen people think about making pan-viral detection reagents,
p26
aVusually it's the fast-evolving problem that's an issue,
p27
aVbecause how can we detect things if they're always changing?
p28
aVBut evolution is a balance:
p29
aVwhere you have fast change, you also have ultra-conservation \u2014
p30
aVthings that almost never change.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd so we looked into this a little more carefully,
p33
aVand I'm going to show you data now.
p34
aVThis is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop.
p35
aVI took a bunch of these small picornaviruses,
p36
aVlike the common cold, like polio and so on,
p37
aVand I just broke them down into small segments.
p38
aVAnd so took this first example, which is called coxsackievirus,
p39
aVand just break it into small windows.
p40
aVAnd I'm coloring these small windows blue
p41
aVif another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome
p42
aVto that virus.
p43
aVThese sequences right up here \u2014
p44
aVwhich don't even code for protein, by the way \u2014
p45
aVare almost absolutely identical across all of these,
p46
aVso I could use this sequence as a marker
p47
aVto detect a wide spectrum of viruses,
p48
aVwithout having to make something individual.
p49
aVNow, over here there's great diversity:
p50
aVthat's where things are evolving fast.
p51
aVDown here you can see slower evolution: less diversity.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, by the time we get out here to, let's say,
p54
aVacute bee paralysis virus \u2014
p55
aVprobably a bad one to have if you're a bee \u2014-
p56
aVthis virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus,
p57
aVbut I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved
p58
aVamong these viruses on the right-hand of the screen
p59
aVare in identical regions right up here.
p60
aVAnd so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation
p61
aVthrough evolution \u2014 how these viruses evolved \u2014
p62
aVby just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements
p63
aVin these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents.
p64
aa(lp65
VOK, so that's what we did, but how are we going to do that?
p66
aVWell, for a long time, since I was in graduate school,
p67
aVI've been messing around making DNA chips \u2014
p68
aVthat is, printing DNA on glass.
p69
aVAnd that's what you see here:
p70
aVThese little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass,
p71
aVand so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip
p72
aVand use them as a detection reagent.
p73
aVWe took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard
p74
aVand used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots,
p75
aVand this is what you see:
p76
aVyou can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.
p77
aVSo, what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass \u2014
p78
aVlittle flat things \u2014 and these are going to be markers for pathogens.
p79
aVOK, I make little robots in lab to make these chips,
p80
aVand I'm really big on disseminating technology.
p81
aVIf you've got enough money to buy just a Camry,
p82
aVyou can build one of these too,
p83
aVand so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web, totally free,
p84
aVwith basically order-off-the-shelf parts.
p85
aVYou can build a DNA array machine in your garage.
p86
aVHere's the section on the all-important emergency stop switch.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVEvery important machine's got to have a big red button.
p89
aVBut really, it's pretty robust.
p90
aVYou can actually be making DNA chips in your garage
p91
aVand decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd so what we did \u2014 and this is a really cool project \u2014
p95
aVwe just started by making a respiratory virus chip.
p96
aVI talked about that \u2014
p97
aVyou know, that situation where you go into the clinic
p98
aVand you don't get diagnosed?
p99
aVWell, we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses
p100
aVon one chip, and we threw in herpes virus for good measure \u2014
p101
aVI mean, why not?
p102
aVThe first thing you do as a scientist is,
p103
aVyou make sure stuff works.
p104
aVAnd so what we did is, we take tissue culture cells
p105
aVand infect them with various viruses,
p106
aVand we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid,
p107
aVthe genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells \u2014
p108
aVmostly viral stuff \u2014 and stick it on the array to see where it sticks.
p109
aVNow, if the DNA sequences match, they'll stick together,
p110
aVand so we can look at spots.
p111
aVAnd if spots light up, we know there's a certain virus in there.
p112
aa(lp113
VThat's what one of these chips really looks like,
p114
aVand these red spots are, in fact, signals coming from the virus.
p115
aVAnd each spot represents a different family of virus
p116
aVor species of virus.
p117
aVAnd so, that's a hard way to look at things,
p118
aVso I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode,
p119
aVgrouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way.
p120
aVWhat we did is, we took tissue culture cells
p121
aVand infected them with adenovirus,
p122
aVand you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus.
p123
aVAnd, likewise, we infected them with parainfluenza-3 \u2014
p124
aVthat's a paramyxovirus \u2014 and you see a little barcode here.
p125
aVAnd then we did respiratory syncytial virus.
p126
aVThat's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere \u2014
p127
aVit's like boogeremia, basically.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVYou can see that this barcode is the same family,
p130
aVbut it's distinct from parainfluenza-3,
p131
aVwhich gives you a very bad cold.
p132
aVAnd so we're getting unique signatures, a fingerprint for each virus.
p133
aVPolio and rhino: they're in the same family, very close to each other.
p134
aVRhino's the common cold, and you all know what polio is,
p135
aVand you can see that these signatures are distinct.
p136
aVAnd Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus
p137
aVgives a nice signature down here.
p138
aVAnd so it is not any one stripe or something
p139
aVthat tells me I have a virus of a particular type here;
p140
aVit's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing.
p141
aa(lp142
VAll right, I can see a rhinovirus \u2014
p143
aVand here's the blow-up of the rhinovirus's little barcode \u2014
p144
aVbut what about different rhinoviruses?
p145
aVHow do I know which rhinovirus I have?
p146
aVThere're 102 known variants of the common cold,
p147
aVand there're only 102 because people got bored collecting them:
p148
aVthere are just new ones every year.
p149
aVAnd so, here are four different rhinoviruses,
p150
aVand you can see, even with your eye,
p151
aVwithout any fancy computer pattern-matching
p152
aVrecognition software algorithms,
p153
aVthat you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, this is kind of a cheap shot,
p156
aVbecause I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is,
p157
aVand I in fact designed the chip
p158
aVexpressly to be able to tell them apart,
p159
aVbut what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer?
p160
aVWe don't know what the sequence is; just pull them out of the field.
p161
aVSo, here are four rhinoviruses
p162
aVwe never knew anything about \u2014
p163
aVno one's ever sequenced them \u2014 and you can also see
p164
aVthat you get unique and distinguishable patterns.
p165
aVYou can imagine building up some library, whether real or virtual,
p166
aVof fingerprints of essentially every virus.
p167
aVBut that's, again, shooting fish in a barrel, you know, right?
p168
aVYou have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses.
p169
aVWhat about real people?
p170
aVYou can't control real people, as you probably know.
p171
aVYou have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup,
p172
aVand it's probably really complex, right?
p173
aVIt could have lots of bacteria, it could have more than one virus,
p174
aVand it certainly has host genetic material.
p175
aVSo how do we deal with this?
p176
aVAnd how do we do the positive control here?
p177
aa(lp178
VWell, it's pretty simple.
p179
aVThat's me, getting a nasal lavage.
p180
aVAnd the idea is, let's experimentally inoculate people with virus.
p181
aVThis is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid.
p182
aVAnd basically we experimentally inoculate people
p183
aVwith the common cold virus.
p184
aVOr, even better, let's just take people
p185
aVright out of the emergency room \u2014
p186
aVundefined, community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
p187
aVYou have no idea what walks in through the door.
p188
aVSo, let's start off with the positive control first,
p189
aVwhere we know the person was healthy.
p190
aVThey got a shot of virus up the nose,
p191
aVlet's see what happens.
p192
aa(lp193
VDay zero: nothing happening.
p194
aVThey're healthy; they're clean \u2014 it's amazing.
p195
aVActually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses
p196
aVeven when you're walking around healthy.
p197
aVIt's pretty clean. If you're healthy, you're pretty healthy.
p198
aVDay two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern,
p199
aVand it's very similar to what we get in the lab
p200
aVdoing our tissue culture experiment.
p201
aVSo that's great, but again, cheap shot, right?
p202
aVWe put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So \u2014
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aV\u2014 I mean, we wanted it to work. He really had a cold.
p205
aVSo, how about the people who walk in off the street?
p206
aa(lp207
VHere are two individuals represented by their anonymous ID codes.
p208
aVThey both have rhinoviruses; we've never seen this pattern in lab.
p209
aVWe sequenced part of their viruses;
p210
aVthey're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen.
p211
aVRemember, our evolutionary-conserved sequences
p212
aVwe're using on this array allow us to detect
p213
aVeven novel or uncharacterized viruses,
p214
aVbecause we pick what is conserved throughout evolution.
p215
aVHere's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here.
p216
aVThese different blocks represent
p217
aVthe different viruses in this paramyxovirus family,
p218
aVso you can kind of go down the blocks
p219
aVand see where the signal is.
p220
aVWell, doesn't have canine distemper; that's probably good.
p221
aV(Laughter)
p222
aVBut by the time you get to block nine,
p223
aVyou see that respiratory syncytial virus.
p224
aVMaybe they have kids. And then you can see, also,
p225
aVthe family member that's related: RSVB is showing up here.
p226
aVSo, that's great.
p227
aVHere's another individual, sampled on two separate days \u2014
p228
aVrepeat visits to the clinic.
p229
aVThis individual has parainfluenza-1,
p230
aVand you can see that there's a little stripe over here
p231
aVfor Sendai virus: that's mouse parainfluenza.
p232
aVThe genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo, we built out the chip.
p235
aVWe made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it.
p236
aVWhy not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus.
p237
aVEverything that we could get out of GenBank \u2014
p238
aVthat is, the national repository of sequences.
p239
aVNow we're using this chip. And what are we using it for?
p240
aVWell, first of all, when you have a big chip like this,
p241
aVyou need a little bit more informatics,
p242
aVso we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis.
p243
aVAnd the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns,
p244
aVbecause we're never going to get samples of every virus \u2014
p245
aVit would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns,
p246
aVand compare them to our observed result \u2014
p247
aVwhich is a very complex mixture \u2014 and come up with some sort of score
p248
aVof how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.
p249
aVAnd this is what this looks like.
p250
aVIf, for example, you used a cell culture
p251
aVthat's chronically infected with papilloma,
p252
aVyou get a little computer readout here,
p253
aVand our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type 18.
p254
aVAnd that is, in fact, what these particular cell cultures
p255
aVare chronically infected with.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo let's do something a little bit harder.
p258
aVWe put the beeper in the clinic.
p259
aVWhen somebody shows up, and the hospital doesn't know what to do
p260
aVbecause they can't diagnose it, they call us.
p261
aVThat's the idea, and we're setting this up in the Bay Area.
p262
aVAnd so, this case report happened three weeks ago.
p263
aVWe have a 28-year-old healthy woman, no travel history,
p264
aV[unclear], doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.
p265
aV10-day history of fevers, night sweats, bloody sputum \u2014
p266
aVshe's coughing up blood \u2014 muscle pain.
p267
aVShe went to the clinic, and they gave her antibiotics
p268
aVand then sent her home.
p269
aVShe came back after ten days of fever, right? Still has the fever,
p270
aVand she's hypoxic \u2014 she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs.
p271
aVThey did a CT scan.
p272
aVA normal lung is all sort of dark and black here.
p273
aVAll this white stuff \u2014 it's not good.
p274
aVThis sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation;
p275
aVthere's likely to be infection.
p276
aVOK. So, the patient was treated then
p277
aVwith a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline,
p278
aVand on day three, it didn't help: she had progressed to acute failure.
p279
aVThey had to intubate her, so they put a tube down her throat
p280
aVand they began to mechanically ventilate her.
p281
aVShe could no longer breathe for herself.
p282
aVWhat to do next? Don't know.
p283
aVSwitch antibiotics: so they switched to another antibiotic,
p284
aVTamiflu.
p285
aVIt's not clear why they thought she had the flu,
p286
aVbut they switched to Tamiflu.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd on day six, they basically threw in the towel.
p289
aVYou do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options.
p290
aVThere's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure,
p291
aVand so basically \u2014 and what do they learn from it?
p292
aVYou're looking at her open lung biopsy.
p293
aVAnd I'm no pathologist, but you can't tell much from this.
p294
aVAll you can tell is, there's a lot of swelling: bronchiolitis.
p295
aVIt was "unrevealing": that's the pathologist's report.
p296
aVAnd so, what did they test her for?
p297
aVThey have their own tests, of course,
p298
aVand so they tested her for over 70 different assays,
p299
aVfor every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay
p300
aVyou can buy off the shelf:
p301
aVSARS, metapneumovirus, HIV, RSV \u2014 all these.
p302
aVEverything came back negative, over 100,000 dollars worth of tests.
p303
aVI mean, they went to the max for this woman.
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd basically on hospital day eight, that's when they called us.
p306
aVThey gave us endotracheal aspirate \u2014
p307
aVyou know, a little fluid from the throat,
p308
aVfrom this tube that they got down there \u2014 and they gave us this.
p309
aVWe put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4.
p310
aVWell, what the hell's parainfluenza-4?
p311
aVNo one tests for parainfluenza-4. No one cares about it.
p312
aVIn fact, it's not even really sequenced that much.
p313
aVThere's just a little bit of it sequenced.
p314
aVThere's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.
p315
aVNo one would even consider it,
p316
aVbecause no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure.
p317
aVAnd why is that? Just lore. There's no data \u2014
p318
aVno data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease.
p319
aVClearly, we have a case of a healthy person that's going down.
p320
aa(lp321
VOK, that's one case report.
p322
aVI'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes
p323
aVthat's unpublished \u2014 it's going to come out tomorrow \u2014
p324
aVand it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip
p325
aVto find something new and open a new door.
p326
aVProstate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics
p327
aVabout prostate cancer. Most of you already know it:
p328
aVthird leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.
p329
aVLots of risk factors,
p330
aVbut there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.
p331
aVFor maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer,
p332
aVthere are folks that are predisposed to it.
p333
aVAnd the first gene that was mapped in association studies
p334
aVfor this, early-onset prostate cancer, was this gene called RNASEL.
p335
aVWhat is that? It's an antiviral defense enzyme.
p336
aVSo, we're sitting around and thinking,
p337
aV"Why would men who have the mutation \u2014
p338
aVa defect in an antiviral defense system \u2014 get prostate cancer?
p339
aVIt doesn't make sense \u2014 unless, maybe, there's a virus?"
p340
aa(lp341
VSo, we put tumors \u2014- and now we have over 100 tumors \u2014 on our array.
p342
aVAnd we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't.
p343
aVAnd I'm showing you the signal from the chip here,
p344
aVand I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos.
p345
aVAnd what I'm telling you here from the signal, is
p346
aVthat men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme,
p347
aVand have a tumor, often have \u2014 40 percent of the time \u2014
p348
aVa signature which reveals a new retrovirus.
p349
aVOK, that's pretty wild. What is it?
p350
aVSo, we clone the whole virus.
p351
aVFirst of all, I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us
p352
aVit was very similar to a mouse virus.
p353
aVBut that doesn't tell us too much,
p354
aVso we actually clone the whole thing.
p355
aVAnd the viral genome I'm showing you right here?
p356
aVIt's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new;
p357
aVno one's ever seen it before.
p358
aVIts closest relative is, in fact, from mice,
p359
aVand so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus,
p360
aVbecause it's infecting a species other than mice.
p361
aVAnd this is a little phylogenetic tree
p362
aVto see how it's related to other viruses.
p363
aVWe've done it for many patients now,
p364
aVand we can say that they're all independent infections.
p365
aVThey all have the same virus,
p366
aVbut they're different enough that there's reason to believe
p367
aVthat they've been independently acquired.
p368
aVIs it really in the tissue? And I'll end up with this: yes.
p369
aVWe take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue
p370
aVand use material to actually locate the virus,
p371
aVand we find cells here with viral particles in them.
p372
aVThese guys really do have this virus.
p373
aa(lp374
VDoes this virus cause prostate cancer?
p375
aVNothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know.
p376
aVIs it a link to oncogenesis? I don't know.
p377
aVIs it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses?
p378
aVCould be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer.
p379
aVBut now it's a door.
p380
aVWe have a strong association between the presence of this virus
p381
aVand a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer.
p382
aVThat's where we're at.
p383
aVSo, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid,
p384
aVbut that's what, you know, science is really good at.
p385
aVThis was all done by folks in the lab \u2014
p386
aVI cannot take credit for most of this.
p387
aVThis is a collaboration between myself and Don.
p388
aVThis is the guy who started the project in my lab,
p389
aVand this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff.
p390
aVThank you very much. (Applause)

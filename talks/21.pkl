VOver the past couple of days,
p5
aVas I've been preparing for my speech,
p6
aVI've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say
p7
aVand about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people.
p8
aVBeing on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.
p9
aVAnd \u2014
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VSo I was getting pretty nervous
p14
aVand, you know, I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage,
p15
aVand that's more nerve-racking.
p16
aVBut then I started thinking about my family.
p17
aVI started thinking about my father and my grandfather
p18
aVand my great-grandfather,
p19
aVand I realized
p20
aVthat I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream \u2014
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
Vthat I had to consider this "my element."
p25
aa(lp26
VSo, who am I?
p27
aVChris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband.
p28
aVWe have about 125 people internationally.
p29
aVIf you looked in the book,
p30
aVyou saw this ...
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
Vwhich I really was appalled by.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd because I wanted to impress you all with slides,
p39
aVsince I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs,
p40
aVI made a graph that moves,
p41
aVand I talk about the makeup of me.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, besides this freakish thing,
p46
aVthis is my science slide.
p47
aVThis is math, and this is science, this is genetics.
p48
aVThis is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VSo \u2014
p53
aVI'm a blogger, which, probably, to a lot of you, means different things.
p54
aVYou may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha,
p55
aVwhere a blogger talked about how you hack
p56
aVor break into a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen,
p57
aVand it spread all over.
p58
aVKryptonite had to adjust the lock,
p59
aVand they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns.
p60
aVYou may have heard about Rathergate,
p61
aVwhich was basically the result of bloggers
p62
aVrealizing that the "th" in 111
p63
aVis not typeset on an old typewriter;
p64
aVit's on Word.
p65
aVBloggers exposed this,
p66
aVor they worked hard to expose this.
p67
aVYou know, blogs are scary. This is what you see.
p68
aVI see this, and I'm sure scared \u2014 I swear on stage \u2014 shitless about blogs,
p69
aVbecause this is not something that's friendly.
p70
aVBut there are blogs that are changing the way we read news
p71
aVand consume media, and these are great examples.
p72
aVThese people are reaching thousands,
p73
aVif not millions, of readers,
p74
aVand that's incredibly important.
p75
aVDuring the hurricane,
p76
aVyou had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog,
p77
aVupdating it frequently.
p78
aVThis was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools.
p79
aa(lp80
VYou have my friend,
p81
aVwho has a blog on PVRs, personal recorders.
p82
aVHe makes enough money just by running ads,
p83
aVto support his family up in Oregon.
p84
aVThat's all he does now,
p85
aVand this is something that blogs have made possible.
p86
aVAnd then you have something like this, which is Interplast.
p87
aVIt's a wonderful organization
p88
aVof people and doctors who go to developing nations
p89
aVto offer plastic surgery to those who need it.
p90
aVChildren with cleft palates get it, and they document their story.
p91
aVThis is wonderful.
p92
aVI am not that caring.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VI talk about myself.
p97
aVThat's what I am. I'm a blogger.
p98
aVI have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing,
p99
aVand I am an expert on this person,
p100
aVand so I write about it.
p101
aVSo, the short story about my blog:
p102
aVit started in 2001, I was 23.
p103
aVI wasn't happy with my job,
p104
aVbecause I was a designer,
p105
aVbut I wasn't being really stimulated.
p106
aVI was an English major in college.
p107
aVI didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing.
p108
aVSo, I started to write a blog
p109
aVand I started to create things like these little stories.
p110
aVThis was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old,
p111
aVand how I went to a YMCA camp, Christian camp,
p112
aVand basically by the end,
p113
aVI had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk,
p114
aVThey couldn't find me, they sent a search party,
p115
aVand I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself \u2014
p116
aVjumped off Bible Peak.
p117
aa(lp118
VYou can laugh, this is OK.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VThis is me.
p123
aVThis is what happened to me.
p124
aVAnd when I started my blog, it was really this one goal \u2014
p125
aVI said, "I am not going to be famous to the world,
p126
aVbut I could be famous to people on the Internet."
p127
aVAnd I set a goal.
p128
aVI said, "I'm going to win an award,"
p129
aVbecause I had never won an award in my entire life.
p130
aVAnd I said, "I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award."
p131
aVAnd I won it \u2014 I reached all of these people,
p132
aVand I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd then I wrote a post about a banjo.
p135
aVI wrote a post
p136
aVabout wanting to buy a banjo \u2014
p137
aVa $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.
p138
aVAnd I don't play instruments;
p139
aVI don't know anything about music.
p140
aVI like music, and I like banjos,
p141
aVand I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing,
p142
aVand I said, "I could do that."
p143
aVAnd I said to my husband,
p144
aV"Ben, can I buy a banjo?" And he's like, "No."
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd my husband \u2014
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
Vthis is my husband, who is very hot \u2014
p151
aVhe won an award for being hot.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VHe told me,
p156
aV"You cannot buy a banjo.
p157
aVYou're just like your dad," who collects instruments.
p158
aVAnd I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him,
p159
aVhe was such a tyrant \u2014 he would not let me buy this banjo.
p160
aVAnd those people who know me understood my joke \u2014
p161
aVthis is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.
p162
aVBecause the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant,
p163
aVthis person is so loving and so sweet
p164
aVthat he lets me dress him up
p165
aVand post pictures of him to my blog.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd if he knew I was showing this right now \u2014 I put this in today \u2014
p170
aVhe would kill me.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut the thing was, my friends read it,
p173
aVand they're like, "Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post
p174
aVabout wanting a stupid thing and being stupid."
p175
aVBut I got emails from people that said,
p176
aV"Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole.
p177
aVHow much money does he spend on beer in a year?
p178
aVYou could take that money and buy your banjo.
p179
aVWhy don't you open a separate account?"
p180
aVI've been with him since I was 17, we've never had a separate bank account.
p181
aVThey said, "Separate your bank account.
p182
aVSpend your money; spend his money, that's it."
p183
aVAnd then I got people saying, "Leave him."
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VI was like, "OK, what? Who are these people?
p188
aVAnd why are they reading this?"
p189
aVAnd I realized: I don't want to reach these people.
p190
aVI don't want to write for this public audience.
p191
aVAnd I started to kill my blog slowly.
p192
aVI'm like, I don't want to write this anymore.
p193
aVSlowly and slowly \u2014
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd I did tell personal stories from time to time.
p196
aVI wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.
p197
aVI'm going to get choked up, because this is my first pet,
p198
aVand she passed away two years ago.
p199
aVAnd I decided to break from, "I don't really write about my public life,"
p200
aVbecause I wanted to give her a little memorial.
p201
aVBut anyways, it's these sorts of personal stories \u2014
p202
aVYou know, you read the blogs about politics or about media,
p203
aVand gossip and all these things.
p204
aVThese are out there,
p205
aVbut it's more of the personal that interests me,
p206
aVand this is who I am.
p207
aa(lp208
VYou see Norman Rockwell, and you have art critics say,
p209
aV"Norman Rockwell is not art.
p210
aVNorman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms,
p211
aVand this is not something to be considered high art."
p212
aVAnd I think this is one of the most important things
p213
aVto us as humans.
p214
aVThese things resonate with us,
p215
aVand, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs,
p216
aVthe history paintings about, you know, all the biblical stories,
p217
aVand then you have this.
p218
aVThese are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories.
p219
aa(lp220
VOne story is about this baby, and his name is Odin.
p221
aVHis father was a blogger.
p222
aVAnd he was writing his blog one day,
p223
aVand his wife gave birth to her baby
p224
aVat 25 weeks.
p225
aVAnd he never expected this.
p226
aVOne day, it was normal; the next day, it was hell.
p227
aVAnd this is a one-pound baby.
p228
aVSo Odin was documented every single day.
p229
aa(lp230
VPictures were taken every day: day one, day two ...
p231
aVYou have day nine \u2014 they're talking about his apnea;
p232
aVday 39 \u2014 he gets pneumonia.
p233
aVHis baby is so small,
p234
aVand I've never encountered such a \u2014
p235
aVjust \u2014 a disturbing image, but just so heartfelt.
p236
aVAnd you're reading this as it happens,
p237
aVso on day 55, everybody reads that he's having failures:
p238
aVbreathing failures and heart failures,
p239
aVand it's slowing down, and you don't know what to expect.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut then it gets better. Day 96, he goes home.
p242
aVAnd you see this post.
p243
aVThat's not something you're going to see in a paper or magazine
p244
aVbut this is something this person feels,
p245
aVand people are excited about it \u2014 28 comments.
p246
aVThat's not a huge amount of people reading,
p247
aVbut 28 people matter.
p248
aVAnd today, he is a healthy baby,
p249
aVwho, if you read his blog \u2014
p250
aVit's snowdeal.org, his father's blog \u2014
p251
aVhe is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son
p252
aVand he is, I think, at his age level right now
p253
aVbecause he had received such great treatment from the hospital.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo, blogs.
p256
aVSo what? You've probably heard these things before.
p257
aVWe talked about the WELL, and about all these sorts of things
p258
aVthroughout our online history.
p259
aVBut I think blogs are basically just an evolution,
p260
aVand that's where we are today.
p261
aVIt's this record of who you are, your persona.
p262
aVYou have your Google search, where you say, "What is Mena Trott?"
p263
aVAnd then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy.
p264
aVBut then you also find people's blogs,
p265
aVand those are the records of people that are writing daily \u2014
p266
aVnot necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.
p267
aVAnd we talk about the world flattens, being in this panel,
p268
aVand I am very optimistic \u2014 whenever I think about blogs,
p269
aVI'm like, "We've got to reach all these people."
p270
aVHundreds of millions and billions of people.
p271
aVWe're getting into China, we want to be there,
p272
aVbut there are so many people that won't have the access to write a blog.
p273
aVBut to see something like the $100 computer is amazing,
p274
aVbecause blogging software is simple.
p275
aVWe have a successful company because of timing,
p276
aVand because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff \u2014
p277
aVit's not rocket science.
p278
aVAnd so, that's an amazing thing to consider.
p279
aVSo \u2014
p280
aVthe life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd we started with a slide of my Teds,
p283
aVand I had to add this slide,
p284
aVbecause I knew the minute I showed this, my mom \u2014
p285
aVmy mom will see this, because she does read my blog
p286
aVand she'll say, "Why wasn't there a picture of me?"
p287
aVThis is my mom.
p288
aVSo, I have all the people that I know of.
p289
aVBut this is basically the extent of the family that I know
p290
aVin terms of my direct line.
p291
aVI showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one, I grew up with,
p292
aVlooking at constantly.
p293
aVI would spend hours looking at the connections,
p294
aVsaying, "Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair;
p295
aVso does that first generation up there."
p296
aVAnd it's just these little things.
p297
aVThis is not science, but this was enough for me
p298
aVto be really interested in how we have evolved
p299
aVand how we can trace our line.
p300
aVSo that has always influenced me.
p301
aa(lp302
VI have this record, this 1910 census,
p303
aVof another Grabowski \u2014 that's my maiden name \u2014
p304
aVand there's a Theodore, because there's always a Theodore.
p305
aVThis is all I have, a couple of facts about somebody.
p306
aVI have their date of birth, their age, what they did in their household,
p307
aVif they spoke English,
p308
aVand that's it, that's all I know of these people.
p309
aVAnd it's pretty sad,
p310
aVbecause I only go back five generations, and that's it.
p311
aVI don't even know what happens on my mom's side,
p312
aVbecause she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things.
p313
aVJust doing this, I spent time in the archives \u2014
p314
aVthat's why my husband's a saint \u2014
p315
aVI spent time in the Washington archives,
p316
aVjust sitting there, looking for these things.
p317
aVNow it's online, but he sat through that.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd so you have this record and \u2014
p320
aVThis is my great-great-grandmother.
p321
aVThis is the only picture I have.
p322
aVAnd to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs;
p323
aVto think about the people that are on those $100 computers,
p324
aVtalking about who they are, sharing these personal stories \u2014
p325
aVthis is an amazing thing.
p326
aa(lp327
VAnother photo that has greatly influenced me,
p328
aVor a series of photos, is this project
p329
aVthat's done by an Argentinean man and his wife.
p330
aVAnd he's basically taking a picture of his family every day
p331
aVfor the past, what is '76? \u2014 20 ... Oh my God, I'm '77 \u2014 29 years?
p332
aVTwenty-nine years.
p333
aa(lp334
VThere was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is:
p335
aVYou see all this math?
p336
aVI'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100,
p337
aVbecause that's my skill set.
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VSo you have these people aging,
p342
aVand now this is them today, or last year.
p343
aVAnd that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this.
p344
aVI wish that I would have this of my family.
p345
aVI know that one day my children will be wondering \u2014
p346
aVor my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren,
p347
aVif I ever have children \u2014
p348
aVwhat I am going to \u2014
p349
aVwho I was.
p350
aVSo I do something that's very narcissistic \u2014
p351
aa(lp352
VI am a blogger \u2014
p353
aVthat is an amazing thing for me,
p354
aVbecause it captures a moment in time every day.
p355
aVI take a picture of myself \u2014 I've been doing this since last year \u2014
p356
aVevery single day.
p357
aVAnd, you know, it's the same picture;
p358
aVit's basically the same person.
p359
aa(lp360
VOnly a couple of people read it.
p361
aVI don't write this for this audience;
p362
aVI'm showing it now, but I would go insane if this was really public.
p363
aVAbout four people probably read it,
p364
aVand they tell me, "You haven't updated."
p365
aVI'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated.
p366
aVBut this is amazing, because I can go back to a day \u2014 to April 2005,
p367
aVand say, what was I doing this day?
p368
aVI look at it, I know exactly.
p369
aVIt's this visual cue that is so important to what we do.
p370
aVI put the bad pictures up too,
p371
aVbecause there are bad pictures.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VAnd I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this \u2014
p376
aVI had to go for a one-day trip.
p377
aVI was sick, and I was in a hotel room,
p378
aVand I wanted not to be there.
p379
aVAnd so you see these things, it's not just always smiling.
p380
aVNow I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look.
p381
aVIf you look at my driver's license, I have the same look,
p382
aVand it's a pretty disturbing thing,
p383
aVbut it's something that is really important.
p384
aa(lp385
VAnd the last story I really want to tell is this story,
p386
aVbecause this is probably the one that means the most to me
p387
aVin all of what I'm doing.
p388
aVI'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this.
p389
aVSo, this woman, her name was Emma,
p390
aVand she was a blogger on our service, TypePad.
p391
aVAnd she was a beta tester, so she was there right when we opened \u2014
p392
aVyou know, there was 100 people.
p393
aVAnd she wrote about her life dealing with cancer.
p394
aVShe was writing and writing, and we all started reading it,
p395
aVbecause we had so few blogs on the service,
p396
aVwe could keep track of everyone.
p397
aa(lp398
VAnd she was writing one day,
p399
aVand then she disappeared for a little bit.
p400
aVAnd her sister came on, and she said that Emma had passed away.
p401
aVAnd all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional,
p402
aVand it was a very hard day at the company.
p403
aa(lp404
VAnd this was one of those instances where I realized
p405
aVhow much blogging affects our relationship,
p406
aVand flattening this sort of world.
p407
aVThat this woman is in England,
p408
aVand she lives \u2014 she lived \u2014 a life
p409
aVwhere she was talking about what she was doing.
p410
aVBut the big thing that really influenced us was,
p411
aVher sister wrote to me, and she said \u2014
p412
aVand she wrote on this blog \u2014
p413
aVthat writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life
p414
aVwas probably the best thing that had happened to her,
p415
aVand being able to talk to people and to share what was going on,
p416
aVand being able to write and receive comments.
p417
aVAnd that was amazing,
p418
aVto be able to know that we had empowered that,
p419
aVand that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing,
p420
aVand the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary,
p421
aVthat we don't always have to be attack of the blogs,
p422
aVthat we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people.
p423
aVThat was an amazing thing.
p424
aa(lp425
VAnd so I printed out and sent a PDF of her blog to her family,
p426
aVand they passed it out at her memorial service,
p427
aVand even in her obituary, they mentioned her blog,
p428
aVbecause it was such a big part of her life.
p429
aVAnd that's a huge thing.
p430
aa(lp431
VSo, this is her legacy,
p432
aVand I think that my call to action to all of you is:
p433
aVthink about blogs, think about what they are,
p434
aVthink about what you've thought of them,
p435
aVand then actually do it,
p436
aVbecause it's something that's really going to change our lives.
p437
aa(lp438
VSo, thank you.
p439
aa(lp440

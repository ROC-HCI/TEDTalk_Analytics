VI want to talk to you
p5
aVabout one of the biggest myths in medicine,
p6
aVand that is the idea
p7
aVthat all we need are more medical breakthroughs
p8
aVand then all of our problems will be solved.
p9
aVOur society loves to romanticize
p10
aVthe idea of the single, solo inventor
p11
aVwho, working late in the lab one night,
p12
aVmakes an earthshaking discovery,
p13
aVand voila, overnight everything's changed.
p14
aVThat's a very appealing picture,
p15
aVhowever, it's just not true.
p16
aVIn fact, medicine today is a team sport.
p17
aVAnd in many ways,
p18
aVit always has been.
p19
aVI'd like to share with you a story
p20
aVabout how I've experienced this very dramatically
p21
aVin my own work.
p22
aa(lp23
VI'm a surgeon,
p24
aVand we surgeons have always had
p25
aVthis special relationship with light.
p26
aVWhen I make an incision inside a patient's body, it's dark.
p27
aVWe need to shine light to see what we're doing.
p28
aVAnd this is why, traditionally,
p29
aVsurgeries have always started so early in the morning \u2014
p30
aVto take advantage of daylight hours.
p31
aVAnd if you look at historical pictures
p32
aVof the early operating rooms,
p33
aVthey have been on top of buildings.
p34
aVFor example, this is the oldest operating room in the Western world,
p35
aVin London,
p36
aVwhere the operating room
p37
aVis actually on top of a church
p38
aVwith a skylight coming in.
p39
aVAnd then this is a picture
p40
aVof one of the most famous hospitals in America.
p41
aVThis is Mass General in Boston.
p42
aVAnd do you know where the operating room is?
p43
aVHere it is
p44
aVon the top of the building
p45
aVwith plenty of windows to let light in.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo nowadays in the operating room,
p48
aVwe no longer need to use sunlight.
p49
aVAnd because we no longer need to use sunlight,
p50
aVwe have very specialized lights
p51
aVthat are made for the operating room.
p52
aVWe have an opportunity
p53
aVto bring in other kinds of lights \u2014
p54
aVlights that can allow us to see
p55
aVwhat we currently don't see.
p56
aVAnd this is what I think
p57
aVis the magic of fluorescence.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo let me back up a little bit.
p60
aVWhen we are in medical school,
p61
aVwe learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this
p62
aVwhere everything's color-coded.
p63
aVNerves are yellow, arteries are red,
p64
aVveins are blue.
p65
aVThat's so easy anybody could become a surgeon, right?
p66
aVHowever, when we have a real patient on the table,
p67
aVthis is the same neck dissection \u2014
p68
aVnot so easy to tell the difference
p69
aVbetween different structures.
p70
aVWe heard over the last couple days
p71
aVwhat an urgent problem
p72
aVcancer still is in our society,
p73
aVwhat a pressing need it is
p74
aVfor us to not have
p75
aVone person die every minute.
p76
aVWell if cancer can be caught early,
p77
aVenough such that someone can have their cancer taken out,
p78
aVexcised with surgery,
p79
aVI don't care if it has this gene or that gene,
p80
aVor if it has this protein or that protein,
p81
aVit's in the jar.
p82
aVIt's done, it's out, you're cured of cancer.
p83
aa(lp84
VThis is how we excise cancers.
p85
aVWe do our best, based upon our training
p86
aVand the way the cancer looks and the way it feels
p87
aVand its relationship to other structures and all of our experience,
p88
aVwe say, you know what, the cancer's gone.
p89
aVWe've made a good job. We've taken it out.
p90
aVThat's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room
p91
aVwhen the patient's on the table.
p92
aVBut then we actually don't know that it's all out.
p93
aVWe actually have to take samples from the surgical bed,
p94
aVwhat's left behind in the patient,
p95
aVand then send those bits to the pathology lab.
p96
aVIn the meanwhile, the patient's on the operating room table.
p97
aVThe nurses, anesthesiologist, the surgeon,
p98
aVall the assistants are waiting around.
p99
aVAnd we wait.
p100
aVThe pathologist takes that sample,
p101
aVfreezes it, cuts it, looks in the microscope one by one
p102
aVand then calls back into the room.
p103
aVAnd that may be 20 minutes later per piece.
p104
aVSo if you've sent three specimens,
p105
aVit's an hour later.
p106
aVAnd very often they say,
p107
aV"You know what, points A and B are okay,
p108
aVbut point C, you still have some residual cancer there.
p109
aVPlease go cut that piece out."
p110
aVSo we go back and we do that again, and again.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd this whole process:
p113
aV"Okay you're done.
p114
aVWe think the entire tumor is out."
p115
aVBut very often several days later,
p116
aVthe patient's gone home,
p117
aVwe get a phone call:
p118
aV"I'm sorry,
p119
aVonce we looked at the final pathology,
p120
aVonce we looked at the final specimen,
p121
aVwe actually found that there's a couple other spots
p122
aVwhere the margins are positive.
p123
aVThere's still cancer in your patient."
p124
aVSo now you're faced with telling your patient, first of all,
p125
aVthat they may need another surgery,
p126
aVor that they need additional therapy
p127
aVsuch as radiation or chemotherapy.
p128
aVSo wouldn't it be better
p129
aVif we could really tell,
p130
aVif the surgeon could really tell,
p131
aVwhether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field?
p132
aVI mean, in many ways, the way that we're doing it,
p133
aVwe're still operating in the dark.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo in 2004, during my surgical residency,
p136
aVI had the great fortune
p137
aVto meet Dr. Roger Tsien,
p138
aVwho went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry
p139
aVin 2008.
p140
aVRoger and his team
p141
aVwere working on a way to detect cancer,
p142
aVand they had a very clever molecule
p143
aVthat they had come up with.
p144
aVThe molecule they had developed
p145
aVhad three parts.
p146
aVThe main part of it is the blue part, polycation,
p147
aVand it's basically very sticky
p148
aVto every tissue in your body.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo imagine that you make a solution
p151
aVfull of this sticky material
p152
aVand inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer,
p153
aVeverything's going to get lit up.
p154
aVNothing will be specific.
p155
aVThere's no specificity there.
p156
aVSo they added two additional components.
p157
aVThe first one is a polyanionic segment,
p158
aVwhich basically acts as a non-stick backing
p159
aVlike the back of a sticker.
p160
aVSo when those two are together, the molecule is neutral
p161
aVand nothing gets stuck down.
p162
aVAnd the two pieces are then linked
p163
aVby something that can only be cut
p164
aVif you have the right molecular scissors \u2014
p165
aVfor example, the kind of protease enzymes
p166
aVthat tumors make.
p167
aVSo here in this situation,
p168
aVif you make a solution full of this three-part molecule
p169
aValong with the dye, which is shown in green,
p170
aVand you inject it into the vein
p171
aVof someone who has cancer,
p172
aVnormal tissue can't cut it.
p173
aVThe molecule passes through and gets excreted.
p174
aVHowever, in the presence of the tumor,
p175
aVnow there are molecular scissors
p176
aVthat can break this molecule apart
p177
aVright there at the cleavable site.
p178
aVAnd now, boom,
p179
aVthe tumor labels itself
p180
aVand it gets fluorescent.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo here's an example of a nerve
p183
aVthat has tumor surrounding it.
p184
aVCan you tell where the tumor is?
p185
aVI couldn't when I was working on this.
p186
aVBut here it is. It's fluorescent.
p187
aVNow it's green.
p188
aVSee, so every single one in the audience
p189
aVnow can tell where the cancer is.
p190
aVWe can tell in the operating room, in the field,
p191
aVat a molecular level,
p192
aVwhere is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do
p193
aVand how much more work they need to do
p194
aVto cut that out.
p195
aVAnd the cool thing about fluorescence
p196
aVis that it's not only bright,
p197
aVit actually can shine through tissue.
p198
aVThe light that the fluorescence emits
p199
aVcan go through tissue.
p200
aVSo even if the tumor is not right on the surface,
p201
aVyou'll still be able to see it.
p202
aa(lp203
VIn this movie, you can see
p204
aVthat the tumor is green.
p205
aVThere's actually normal muscle on top of it. See that?
p206
aVAnd I'm peeling that muscle away.
p207
aVBut even before I peel that muscle away,
p208
aVyou saw that there was a tumor underneath.
p209
aVSo that's the beauty of having a tumor
p210
aVthat's labeled with fluorescent molecules.
p211
aVThat you can, not only see the margins
p212
aVright there on a molecular level,
p213
aVbut you can see it even if it's not right on the top \u2014
p214
aVeven if it's beyond your field of view.
p215
aVAnd this works for metastatic lymph nodes also.
p216
aa(lp217
VSentinel lymph node dissection
p218
aVhas really changed the way that we manage breast cancer, melanoma.
p219
aVWomen used to get
p220
aVreally debilitating surgeries
p221
aVto excise all of the axillary lymph nodes.
p222
aVBut when sentinel lymph node
p223
aVcame into our treatment protocol,
p224
aVthe surgeon basically looks for the single node
p225
aVthat is the first draining lymph node of the cancer.
p226
aVAnd then if that node has cancer,
p227
aVthe woman would go on to get
p228
aVthe axillary lymph node dissection.
p229
aVSo what that means
p230
aVis if the lymph node did not have cancer,
p231
aVthe woman would be saved
p232
aVfrom having unnecessary surgery.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut sentinel lymph node, the way that we do it today,
p235
aVis kind of like having a road map
p236
aVjust to know where to go.
p237
aVSo if you're driving on the freeway
p238
aVand you want to know where's the next gas station,
p239
aVyou have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road.
p240
aVIt doesn't tell you whether or not
p241
aVthe gas station has gas.
p242
aVYou have to cut it out, bring it back home,
p243
aVcut it up, look inside
p244
aVand say, "Oh yes, it does have gas."
p245
aVSo that takes more time.
p246
aVPatients are still on the operating room table.
p247
aVAnesthesiologists, surgeons are waiting around.
p248
aVThat takes time.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo with our technology, we can tell right away.
p251
aVYou see a lot of little, roundish bumps there.
p252
aVSome of these are swollen lymph nodes
p253
aVthat look a little larger than others.
p254
aVWho amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold?
p255
aVThat doesn't mean that there's cancer inside.
p256
aVWell with our technology,
p257
aVthe surgeon is able to tell immediately
p258
aVwhich nodes have cancer.
p259
aVI won't go into this very much,
p260
aVbut our technology, besides being able
p261
aVto tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence,
p262
aVwe can also use the same smart three-part molecule
p263
aVto tag gadolinium onto the system
p264
aVso you can do this noninvasively.
p265
aVThe patient has cancer,
p266
aVyou want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer
p267
aVeven before you go in.
p268
aVWell you can see this on an MRI.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo in surgery,
p271
aVit's important to know what to cut out.
p272
aVBut equally important
p273
aVis to preserve things
p274
aVthat are important for function.
p275
aVSo it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury.
p276
aVAnd what I'm talking about
p277
aVare nerves.
p278
aVNerves, if they are injured,
p279
aVcan cause paralysis,
p280
aVcan cause pain.
p281
aVIn the setting of prostate cancer,
p282
aVup to 60 percent of men
p283
aVafter prostate cancer surgery
p284
aVmay have urinary incontinence
p285
aVand erectile disfunction.
p286
aVThat's a lot of people to have a lot of problems \u2014
p287
aVand this is even in
p288
aVso-called nerve-sparing surgery,
p289
aVwhich means that the surgeon is aware of the problem,
p290
aVand they are trying to avoid the nerves.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut you know what, these little nerves are so small,
p293
aVin the context of prostate cancer,
p294
aVthat they are actually never seen.
p295
aVThey are traced
p296
aVjust by their known anatomical path
p297
aValong vasculature.
p298
aVAnd they're known because somebody has decided to study them,
p299
aVwhich means that we're still learning
p300
aVabout where they are.
p301
aVCrazy to think that we're having surgery,
p302
aVwe're trying to excise cancer, we don't know where the cancer is.
p303
aVWe're trying to preserve nerves; we can't see where they are.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo I said, wouldn't it be great
p306
aVif we could find a way
p307
aVto see nerves with fluorescence?
p308
aVAnd at first this didn't get a lot of support.
p309
aVPeople said, "We've been doing it this way for all these years.
p310
aVWhat's the problem?
p311
aVWe haven't had that many complications."
p312
aVBut I went ahead anyway.
p313
aVAnd Roger helped me.
p314
aVAnd he brought his whole team with him.
p315
aVSo there's that teamwork thing again.
p316
aVAnd we eventually discovered molecules
p317
aVthat were specifically labeling nerves.
p318
aVAnd when we made a solution of this,
p319
aVtagged with the fluorescence
p320
aVand injected in the body of a mouse,
p321
aVtheir nerves literally glowed.
p322
aVYou can see where they are.
p323
aa(lp324
VHere you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse,
p325
aVand you can see that that big, fat portion you can see very easily.
p326
aVBut in fact, at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now,
p327
aVthere's actually very fine arborizations
p328
aVthat can't really be seen.
p329
aVYou see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out.
p330
aVWe have been able to see nerves
p331
aVfor facial expression, for facial movement, for breathing \u2014
p332
aVevery single nerve \u2014
p333
aVnerves for urinary function around the prostate.
p334
aVWe've been able to see every single nerve.
p335
aVWhen we put these two probes together ...
p336
aVSo here's a tumor.
p337
aVDo you guys know where the margins of this tumor is?
p338
aVNow you do.
p339
aVWhat about the nerve that's going into this tumor?
p340
aVThat white portion there is easy to see.
p341
aVBut what about the part that goes into the tumor?
p342
aVDo you know where it's going?
p343
aVNow you do.
p344
aa(lp345
VBasically, we've come up with a way
p346
aVto stain tissue
p347
aVand color-code the surgical field.
p348
aVThis was a bit of a breakthrough.
p349
aVI think that it'll change the way that we do surgery.
p350
aVWe published our results
p351
aVin the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
p352
aVand in Nature Biotechnology.
p353
aVWe received commentary in Discover magazine,
p354
aVin The Economist.
p355
aVAnd we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues.
p356
aVThey said, "Wow!
p357
aVI have patients
p358
aVwho would benefit from this.
p359
aVI think that this will result in my surgeries
p360
aVwith a better outcome
p361
aVand fewer complications."
p362
aa(lp363
VWhat needs to happen now
p364
aVis further development of our technology
p365
aValong with development
p366
aVof the instrumentation
p367
aVthat allows us to see
p368
aVthis sort of fluorescence in the operating room.
p369
aVThe eventual goal
p370
aVis that we'll get this into patients.
p371
aVHowever, we've discovered
p372
aVthat there's actually no straightforward mechanism
p373
aVto develop a molecule
p374
aVfor one-time use.
p375
aVUnderstandably, the majority of the medical industry
p376
aVis focused on multiple-use drugs,
p377
aVsuch as long-term daily medications.
p378
aVWe are focused on making this technology better.
p379
aVWe're focused on adding drugs,
p380
aVadding growth factors,
p381
aVkilling nerves that are causing problems
p382
aVand not the surrounding tissue.
p383
aVWe know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it.
p384
aa(lp385
VI'd like to leave you with this final thought.
p386
aVSuccessful innovation
p387
aVis not a single breakthrough.
p388
aVIt is not a sprint.
p389
aVIt is not an event for the solo runner.
p390
aVSuccessful innovation
p391
aVis a team sport, it's a relay race.
p392
aVIt requires one team for the breakthrough
p393
aVand another team
p394
aVto get the breakthrough accepted and adopted.
p395
aVAnd this takes the long-term steady courage
p396
aVof the day-in day-out struggle
p397
aVto educate, to persuade
p398
aVand to win acceptance.
p399
aVAnd that is the light that I want to shine
p400
aVon health and medicine today.
p401
aa(lp402
VThank you very much.

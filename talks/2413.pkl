VDemocracy.
p5
aVIn the West,
p6
aVwe make a colossal mistake taking it for granted.
p7
aVWe see democracy
p8
aVnot as the most fragile of flowers that it really is,
p9
aVbut we see it as part of our society's furniture.
p10
aVWe tend to think of it as an intransigent given.
p11
aVWe mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy.
p12
aVIt doesn't.
p13
aa(lp14
VSingapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing
p15
aVhave demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt
p16
aVthat it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism,
p17
aVspectacular growth,
p18
aVwhile politics remains democracy-free.
p19
aVIndeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods,
p20
aVhere in Europe.
p21
aa(lp22
VEarlier this year, while I was representing Greece \u2014
p23
aVthe newly elected Greek government \u2014
p24
aVin the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,
p25
aVI was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process \u2014
p26
aVour elections \u2014
p27
aVcould not be allowed to interfere
p28
aVwith economic policies that were being implemented in Greece.
p29
aVAt that moment,
p30
aVI felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew,
p31
aVor the Chinese Communist Party,
p32
aVindeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me
p33
aVthat democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.
p34
aa(lp35
VTonight, here, I want to present to you
p36
aVan economic case for an authentic democracy.
p37
aVI want to ask you to join me in believing again
p38
aVthat Lee Kuan Yew,
p39
aVthe Chinese Communist Party
p40
aVand indeed the Eurogroup
p41
aVare wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy \u2014
p42
aVthat we need an authentic, boisterous democracy.
p43
aVAnd without democracy,
p44
aVour societies will be nastier,
p45
aVour future bleak
p46
aVand our great, new technologies wasted.
p47
aa(lp48
VSpeaking of waste,
p49
aVallow me to point out an interesting paradox
p50
aVthat is threatening our economies as we speak.
p51
aVI call it the twin peaks paradox.
p52
aVOne peak you understand \u2014
p53
aVyou know it, you recognize it \u2014
p54
aVis the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow
p55
aVover the United States, Europe, the whole world.
p56
aVWe all recognize the mountain of debts.
p57
aVBut few people discern its twin.
p58
aVA mountain of idle cash
p59
aVbelonging to rich savers and to corporations,
p60
aVtoo terrified to invest it
p61
aVinto the productive activities that can generate the incomes
p62
aVfrom which you can extinguish the mountain of debts
p63
aVand which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs,
p64
aVlike green energy.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow let me give you two numbers.
p67
aVOver the last three months,
p68
aVin the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone,
p69
aVwe have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars
p70
aVon all the wealth-producing goods \u2014
p71
aVthings like industrial plants, machinery,
p72
aVoffice blocks, schools,
p73
aVroads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth.
p74
aV$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money
p75
aVuntil you compare it to the $5.1 trillion
p76
aVthat has been slushing around in the same countries,
p77
aVin our financial institutions,
p78
aVdoing absolutely nothing during the same period
p79
aVexcept inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash
p82
aVform twin peaks,  failing to cancel each other out
p83
aVthrough the normal operation of the markets.
p84
aa(lp85
VThe result is stagnant wages,
p86
aVmore than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe
p87
aVout of work.
p88
aVAnd consequently, low aggregate demand,
p89
aVwhich in a never-ending cycle,
p90
aVreinforces the pessimism of the investors,
p91
aVwho, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing \u2014
p92
aVexactly like Oedipus' father,
p93
aVwho, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle
p94
aVthat his son would grow up to kill him,
p95
aVunwittingly engineered the conditions
p96
aVthat ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.
p97
aa(lp98
VThis is my quarrel with capitalism.
p99
aVIts gross wastefulness,
p100
aVall this idle cash,
p101
aVshould be energized to improve lives,
p102
aVto develop human talents,
p103
aVand indeed to finance all these technologies,
p104
aVgreen technologies,
p105
aVwhich are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.
p106
aa(lp107
VAm I right in believing that democracy might be the answer?
p108
aVI believe so,
p109
aVbut before we move on,
p110
aVwhat do we mean by democracy?
p111
aVAristotle defined democracy
p112
aVas the constitution in which the free and the poor,
p113
aVbeing in the majority, control government.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many.
p116
aVWomen, migrants and, of course, the slaves.
p117
aVBut it would be a mistake
p118
aVto dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy
p119
aVon the basis of whom it excluded.
p120
aa(lp121
VWhat was more pertinent,
p122
aVand continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy,
p123
aVwas the inclusion of the working poor,
p124
aVwho not only acquired the right to free speech,
p125
aVbut more importantly, crucially,
p126
aVthey acquired the rights to political judgments
p127
aVthat were afforded equal weight
p128
aVin the decision-making concerning matters of state.
p129
aVNow, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long.
p130
aVLike a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly.
p131
aVAnd indeed,
p132
aVour liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens.
p133
aVThey have their roots in the Magna Carta,
p134
aVin the 1688 Glorious Revolution,
p135
aVindeed in the American constitution.
p136
aVWhereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen
p137
aVand empowering the working poor,
p138
aVour liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition,
p139
aVwhich was, after all, a charter for masters.
p140
aVAnd indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible
p141
aVto separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere,
p142
aVso as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere,
p143
aVleaving the economic sphere \u2014
p144
aVthe corporate world, if you want \u2014
p145
aVas a democracy-free zone.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, in our democracies today,
p148
aVthis separation of the economic from the political sphere,
p149
aVthe moment it started happening,
p150
aVit gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two,
p151
aVwith the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere,
p152
aVeating into its power.
p153
aa(lp154
VHave you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be?
p155
aVIt's not because their DNA has degenerated.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VIt is rather because one can be in government today and not in power,
p160
aVbecause power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere,
p161
aVwhich is separate.
p162
aa(lp163
VIndeed,
p164
aVI spoke about my quarrel with capitalism.
p165
aVIf you think about it,
p166
aVit is a little bit like a population of predators,
p167
aVthat are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on,
p168
aVthat in the end they starve.
p169
aa(lp170
VSimilarly,
p171
aVthe economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere
p172
aVto such an extent that it is undermining itself,
p173
aVcausing economic crisis.
p174
aVCorporate power is increasing,
p175
aVpolitical goods are devaluing,
p176
aVinequality is rising,
p177
aVaggregate demand is falling
p178
aVand CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy,
p181
aVthe taller the twin peaks
p182
aVand the greater the waste of human resources
p183
aVand humanity's wealth.
p184
aa(lp185
VClearly, if this is right,
p186
aVwe must reunite the political and economic spheres
p187
aVand better do it with a demos being in control,
p188
aVlike in ancient Athens except without the slaves
p189
aVor the exclusion of women and migrants.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, this is not an original idea.
p192
aVThe Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago
p193
aVand it didn't go very well, did it?
p194
aa(lp195
VThe lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle
p196
aVis that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered,
p197
aVas they were in ancient Athens,
p198
aVwithout creating new forms of brutality and waste.
p199
aa(lp200
VBut there is a solution:
p201
aVeliminate the working poor.
p202
aVCapitalism's doing it
p203
aVby replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots.
p204
aVThe problem is
p205
aVthat as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate,
p206
aVautomation makes the twin peaks taller,
p207
aVthe waste loftier
p208
aVand the social conflicts deeper,
p209
aVincluding \u2014
p210
aVsoon, I believe \u2014
p211
aVin places like China.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo we need to reconfigure,
p214
aVwe need to reunite the economic and the political spheres,
p215
aVbut we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere,
p216
aVlest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy
p217
aVthat makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VSo the question is not whether capitalism will survive
p222
aVthe technological innovations it is spawning.
p223
aVThe more interesting question
p224
aVis whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia
p225
aVor something much closer to a Star Trek-like society,
p226
aVwhere machines serve the humans
p227
aVand the humans expend their energies exploring the universe
p228
aVand indulging in long debates about the meaning of life
p229
aVin some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.
p230
aa(lp231
VI think we can afford to be optimistic.
p232
aVBut what would it take,
p233
aVwhat would it look like
p234
aVto have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?
p235
aa(lp236
VIn practical terms,
p237
aVallow me to share just briefly,
p238
aVa couple of examples.
p239
aa(lp240
VAt the level of the enterprise,
p241
aVimagine a capital market,
p242
aVwhere you earn capital as you work,
p243
aVand where your capital follows you from one job to another,
p244
aVfrom one company to another,
p245
aVand the company \u2014
p246
aVwhichever one you happen to work at at that time \u2014
p247
aVis solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment.
p248
aVThen all income stems from capital, from profits,
p249
aVand the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete.
p250
aVNo more separation between those who own but do not work in the company
p251
aVand those who work but do not own the company;
p252
aVno more tug-of-war between capital and labor;
p253
aVno great gap between investment and saving;
p254
aVindeed, no towering twin peaks.
p255
aa(lp256
VAt the level of the global political economy,
p257
aVimagine for a moment
p258
aVthat our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate,
p259
aVwith a universal, global, digital currency,
p260
aVone that is issued by the International Monetary Fund,
p261
aVthe G-20,
p262
aVon behalf of all humanity.
p263
aVAnd imagine further
p264
aVthat all international trade is denominated in this currency \u2014
p265
aVlet's call it "the cosmos,"
p266
aVin units of cosmos \u2014
p267
aVwith every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund
p268
aVa sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit,
p269
aVor indeed to a country's trade surplus.
p270
aVAnd imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies,
p271
aVespecially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.
p272
aa(lp273
VThis is not a new idea.
p274
aVIt's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed
p275
aVin 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.
p276
aVThe problem is
p277
aVthat back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it.
p278
aVNow we do,
p279
aVespecially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.
p280
aa(lp281
VThe world that I am describing to you
p282
aVis simultaneously libertarian,
p283
aVin that it prioritizes empowered individuals,
p284
aVMarxist,
p285
aVsince it will have confined to the dustbin of history
p286
aVthe division between capital and labor,
p287
aVand Keynesian,
p288
aVglobal Keynesian.
p289
aVBut above all else,
p290
aVit is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.
p291
aa(lp292
VWill such a world dawn?
p293
aVOr shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia?
p294
aVThe answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively.
p295
aVIt is our choice,
p296
aVand we'd better make it democratically.
p297
aa(lp298
VThank you.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Applause)
p301
aa(lp302
VBruno Giussani: Yanis ...
p303
aVIt was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.
p304
aVWhat is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?
p305
aa(lp306
VYanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said,
p307
aVthen Marx is relevant.
p308
aVBecause the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is \u2014
p309
aVif we don't do it,
p310
aVthen technological innovation is going to create
p311
aVsuch a massive fall in aggregate demand,
p312
aa(lp313
Vwhat Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation.
p314
aVWith this crisis migrating from one part of the world,
p315
aVas it is now,
p316
aVit will destabilize not only our democracies,
p317
aVbut even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy.
p318
aVSo if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant.
p319
aVBut so is Hayek,
p320
aVthat's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,
p321
aVand so is Keynes,
p322
aVso that's why I'm totally confused.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VBG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
V(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VYV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?
p333
aa(lp334
VBG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say \u2014
p335
aa(lp336
VYV: That was Einstein, actually \u2014
p337
aa(lp338
VBG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China,
p339
aVand last night at the speaker dinner,
p340
aVyou expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China.
p341
aVWould you like to share that?
p342
aa(lp343
VYV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy.
p344
aVIn our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy.
p345
aVIt's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk,
p346
aVdemocracy to the political sphere,
p347
aVwhile leaving the one sphere where all the action is \u2014
p348
aVthe economic sphere \u2014
p349
aVa completely democracy-free zone.
p350
aa(lp351
VIn a sense,
p352
aVif I am allowed to be provocative,
p353
aVChina today is closer to Britain in the 19th century.
p354
aVBecause remember,
p355
aVwe tend to associate liberalism with democracy \u2014
p356
aVthat's a mistake, historically.
p357
aVLiberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill.
p358
aVJohn Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process.
p359
aVSo what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process
p360
aVto the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution,
p361
aVespecially the transition from the first to the second.
p362
aVAnd to be castigating China
p363
aVfor doing that which the West did in the 19th century,
p364
aVsmacks of hypocrisy.
p365
aa(lp366
VBG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience
p367
aVas the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.
p368
aa(lp369
VYV: I knew this was coming.
p370
aa(lp371
VBG: Yes.
p372
aa(lp373
VBG: Six months after,
p374
aVhow do you look back at the first half of the year?
p375
aa(lp376
VYV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view,
p377
aVand very disappointing,
p378
aVbecause we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone.
p379
aVNot just Greece, the Eurozone.
p380
aVTo move away from the complacency
p381
aVand the constant denial that there was a massive \u2014
p382
aVand there is a massive architectural fault line
p383
aVgoing through the Eurozone,
p384
aVwhich is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process.
p385
aa(lp386
VWe had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program \u2014
p387
aVwhich by the way,
p388
aVwas the first program to manifest that denial \u2014
p389
aVto put it right.
p390
aVAnd, unfortunately,
p391
aVthe powers in the Eurozone,
p392
aVin the Eurogroup,
p393
aVchose to maintain denial.
p394
aa(lp395
VBut you know what happens.
p396
aVThis is the experience of the Soviet Union.
p397
aVWhen you try to keep alive
p398
aVan economic system that architecturally cannot survive,
p399
aVthrough political will and through authoritarianism,
p400
aVyou may succeed in prolonging it,
p401
aVbut when change happens
p402
aVit happens very abruptly and catastrophically.
p403
aa(lp404
VBG: What kind of change are you foreseeing?
p405
aa(lp406
VYV: Well, there's no doubt
p407
aVthat if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone,
p408
aVthe Eurozone has no future.
p409
aa(lp410
VBG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister?
p411
aa(lp412
VYV: Every day.
p413
aa(lp414
VBG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back \u2014
p415
aa(lp416
V(Applause)
p417
aa(lp418
VNo, but seriously.
p419
aVIf there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter,
p420
aVwho tells you after six months in a job,
p421
aVespecially in such a stressful situation,
p422
aVthat they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people.
p423
aVOf course I made mistakes.
p424
aa(lp425
VThe greatest mistake was to sign the application
p426
aVfor the extension of a loan agreement
p427
aVin the end of February.
p428
aVI was imagining
p429
aVthat there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors
p430
aVto find common ground.
p431
aVAnd there wasn't.
p432
aVThey were simply interested in crushing our government,
p433
aVjust because they did not want
p434
aVto have to deal with the architectural fault lines
p435
aVthat were running through the Eurozone.
p436
aVAnd because they didn't want to admit
p437
aVthat for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece.
p438
aVWe lost one-third of our nominal GDP.
p439
aVThis is worse than the Great Depression.
p440
aVAnd no one has come clean
p441
aVfrom the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy
p442
aVto say, "This was a colossal mistake."
p443
aa(lp444
VBG: Despite all this,
p445
aVand despite the aggressiveness of the discussion,
p446
aVyou seem to be remaining quite pro-European.
p447
aa(lp448
VYV: Absolutely.
p449
aVLook, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone
p450
aVcomes from a person who lives and breathes Europe.
p451
aVMy greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive.
p452
aVBecause if it doesn't,
p453
aVthe centrifugal forces that will be unleashed
p454
aVwill be demonic,
p455
aVand they will destroy the European Union.
p456
aVAnd that will be catastrophic not just for Europe
p457
aVbut for the whole global economy.
p458
aa(lp459
VWe are probably the largest economy in the world.
p460
aVAnd if we allow ourselves
p461
aVto fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's,
p462
aVwhich seems to me to be what we are doing,
p463
aVthen that will be detrimental
p464
aVto the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike.
p465
aa(lp466
VBG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point.
p467
aVYanis, thank you for coming to TED.
p468
aa(lp469
VYV: Thank you.

VMy work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously,
p5
aVon a collective level.
p6
aVAnd what I mean by that, it's the behaviors
p7
aVthat we're in denial about,
p8
aVand the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness.
p9
aVAnd as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday.
p10
aVIt's like when you're mean to your wife
p11
aVbecause you're mad at somebody else.
p12
aVOr when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety.
p13
aVOr when you overeat because your feelings are hurt, or whatever.
p14
aVAnd when we do these kind of things,
p15
aVwhen 300 million people do unconscious behaviors,
p16
aVthen it can add up to a catastrophic consequence
p17
aVthat nobody wants, and no one intended.
p18
aVAnd that's what I look at with my photographic work.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis is an image I just recently completed, that is \u2014
p21
aVwhen you stand back at a distance,
p22
aVit looks like some kind of neo-Gothic, cartoon image
p23
aVof a factory spewing out pollution.
p24
aVAnd as you get a little bit closer,
p25
aVit starts looking like lots of pipes, like maybe a chemical plant,
p26
aVor a refinery, or maybe a hellish freeway interchange.
p27
aVAnd as you get all the way up close,
p28
aVyou realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups.
p29
aVAnd in fact, this is one million plastic cups,
p30
aVwhich is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights
p31
aVin the United States every six hours.
p32
aVWe use four million cups a day on airline flights,
p33
aVand virtually none of them are reused or recycled.
p34
aVThey just don't do that in that industry.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, that number is dwarfed
p37
aVby the number of paper cups we use every day,
p38
aVand that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages,
p39
aVmost of which is coffee.
p40
aVI couldn't fit 40 million cups on a canvas,
p41
aVbut I was able to put 410,000. That's what 410,000 cups looks like.
p42
aVThat's 15 minutes of our cup consumption.
p43
aVAnd if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life,
p44
aVthat's the size it would be.
p45
aVAnd there's an hour's worth of our cups.
p46
aVAnd there's a day's worth of our cups.
p47
aVYou can still see the little people way down there.
p48
aVThat's as high as a 42-story building,
p49
aVand I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference.
p50
aa(lp51
VSpeaking of justice, there's another phenomenon going on in our culture
p52
aVthat I find deeply troubling, and that is that America, right now,
p53
aVhas the largest percentage of its population in prison
p54
aVof any country on Earth.
p55
aVOne out of four people, one out of four humans in prison
p56
aVare Americans, imprisoned in our country.
p57
aVAnd I wanted to show the number.
p58
aVThe number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005.
p59
aVAnd that's gone up since then, but we don't have the numbers yet.
p60
aVSo, I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms,
p61
aVand in the actual print of this piece,
p62
aVeach uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge.
p63
aVThey're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material,
p64
aVand to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas
p65
aVthat was larger than any printer in the world would print.
p66
aVAnd so I had to divide it up into multiple panels
p67
aVthat are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide.
p68
aVThis is that piece installed in a gallery in New York \u2014
p69
aVthose are my parents looking at the piece.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVEvery time I look at this piece,
p72
aVI always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad,
p73
aV"He finally folded his laundry."
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VI want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction.
p77
aVAnd this particular one is about cigarette addiction.
p78
aVI wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans
p79
aVwho die from cigarette smoking.
p80
aVMore than 400,000 people die in the United States every year
p81
aVfrom smoking cigarettes.
p82
aVAnd so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes.
p83
aVAnd, as you slowly step back,
p84
aVyou see that it's a painting by Van Gogh, called "Skull with Cigarette."
p85
aVIt's a strange thing to think about, that on 9/11,
p86
aVwhen that tragedy happened, 3,000 Americans died.
p87
aVAnd do you remember the response?
p88
aVIt reverberated around the world,
p89
aVand will continue to reverberate through time.
p90
aVIt will be something that we talk about in 100 years.
p91
aVAnd yet on that same day, 1,100 Americans died from smoking.
p92
aVAnd the day after that, another 1,100 Americans died from smoking.
p93
aVAnd every single day since then, 1,100 Americans have died.
p94
aVAnd today, 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking.
p95
aVAnd we aren't talking about it \u2014 we dismiss it.
p96
aVThe tobacco lobby, it's too strong.
p97
aVWe just dismiss it out of our consciousness.
p98
aVAnd knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes,
p99
aVwe continue to allow our children, our sons and daughters,
p100
aVto be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking.
p101
aVAnd this is what the next piece is about.
p102
aa(lp103
VThis is just lots and lots of cigarettes: 65,000 cigarettes,
p104
aVwhich is equal to the number of teenagers
p105
aVwho will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S.
p106
aVMore than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and under
p107
aVbegin smoking every year.
p108
aa(lp109
VOne more strange epidemic in the United States
p110
aVthat I want to acquaint you with
p111
aVis this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs.
p112
aVThis is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin.
p113
aVWell, actually, I only had one Vicodin
p114
aVthat I scanned lots and lots of times.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aVAnd so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills,
p117
aVwhich is the number of hospital emergency room visits
p118
aVyearly in the United States,
p119
aVattributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers
p120
aVand anti-anxiety medications.
p121
aVOne-third of all drug overdoses in the U.S. \u2014
p122
aVand that includes cocaine, heroin, alcohol, everything \u2014
p123
aVone-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications.
p124
aVA strange phenomenon.
p125
aa(lp126
VThis is a piece that I just recently completed
p127
aVabout another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon,
p128
aVthis growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.
p129
aV384,000 women, American women, last year
p130
aVwent in for elective breast augmentation surgery.
p131
aVIt's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift,
p132
aVgiven to young girls who are about to go off to college.
p133
aVSo, I made this image out of Barbie dolls,
p134
aVand so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern,
p135
aVand as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls,
p136
aVwhich represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries
p137
aVthat are performed in the U.S. each month.
p138
aVThe vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21.
p139
aVAnd strangely enough, the only plastic surgery
p140
aVthat is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction,
p141
aVand most of that is being done by men.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow, I want to emphasize that these are just examples.
p144
aVI'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues.
p145
aVThey're just examples.
p146
aVAnd the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear
p147
aVthat we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now.
p148
aVThere's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment.
p149
aVWe've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief
p150
aVabout what's going on in our culture right now,
p151
aVwhat's going on in our country,
p152
aVthe atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world.
p153
aVThey've gone missing; these feelings have gone missing.
p154
aVOur cultural joy, our national joy is nowhere to be seen.
p155
aVAnd one of the causes of this, I think,
p156
aVis that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview,
p157
aVthis holoptical worldview, this holographic image
p158
aVthat we're all trying to create in our mind
p159
aVof the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints
p160
aV1,000 miles away of the things that we buy;
p161
aVthe social consequences 10,000 miles away
p162
aVof the daily decisions that we make as consumers.
p163
aa(lp164
VAs we try to build this view,
p165
aVand try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture,
p166
aVthe information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers:
p167
aVnumbers in the millions, in the hundreds of millions,
p168
aVin the billions and now in the trillions.
p169
aVBush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbers
p170
aVthat our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend.
p171
aVWe can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics.
p172
aVAnd so that's what I'm trying to do with my work,
p173
aVis to take these numbers, these statistics
p174
aVfrom the raw language of data, and to translate them
p175
aVinto a more universal visual language, that can be felt.
p176
aVBecause my belief is, if we can feel these issues,
p177
aVif we can feel these things more deeply,
p178
aVthen they'll matter to us more than they do now.
p179
aVAnd if we can find that,
p180
aVthen we'll be able to find, within each one of us,
p181
aVwhat it is that we need to find to face the big question,
p182
aVwhich is: how do we change?
p183
aVThat, to me, is the big question that we face as a people right now:
p184
aVhow do we change? How do we change as a culture,
p185
aVand how do we each individually take responsibility
p186
aVfor the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of,
p187
aVand that is our own behavior?
p188
aa(lp189
VMy belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad
p190
aVto look at these issues.
p191
aVI'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way.
p192
aVI'm simply saying, this is who we are right now.
p193
aVAnd if there are things that we see
p194
aVthat we don't like about our culture,
p195
aVthen we have a choice.
p196
aVThe degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface,
p197
aVto bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon,
p198
aVas we show up for the question of how do we change \u2014
p199
aVit's already defining us as individuals and as a nation,
p200
aVand it will continue to do that, on into the future.
p201
aVAnd it will profoundly affect the well-being, the quality of life
p202
aVof the billions of people
p203
aVwho are going to inherit the results of our decisions.
p204
aVI'm not speaking abstractly about this,
p205
aVI'm speaking \u2014 this is who we are in this room,
p206
aVright now, in this moment.
p207
aa(lp208
VThank you and good afternoon.

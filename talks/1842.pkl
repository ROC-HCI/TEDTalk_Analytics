V"Give me liberty or give me death."
p5
aa(lp6
VWhen Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia,
p7
aVsaid these words in 1775,
p8
aVhe could never have imagined
p9
aVjust how much they would come to resonate
p10
aVwith American generations to come.
p11
aVAt the time, these words were earmarked
p12
aVand targeted against the British,
p13
aVbut over the last 200 years, they've come to embody
p14
aVwhat many Westerners believe,
p15
aVthat freedom is the most cherished value,
p16
aVand that the best systems of politics and economics
p17
aVhave freedom embedded in them.
p18
aVWho could blame them?
p19
aVOver the past hundred years, the combination
p20
aVof liberal democracy and private capitalism
p21
aVhas helped to catapult the United States
p22
aVand Western countries
p23
aVto new levels of economic development.
p24
aVIn the United States over the past hundred years,
p25
aVincomes have increased 30 times,
p26
aVand hundreds of thousands of people
p27
aVhave been moved out of poverty.
p28
aVMeanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation
p29
aVhas helped to spur industrialization
p30
aVand also helped in the creation and the building
p31
aVof things like household appliances
p32
aVsuch as refrigerators and televisions,
p33
aVmotor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets.
p34
aVIt's no surprise, then, that even at the depths
p35
aVof the private capitalism crisis,
p36
aVPresident Obama said,
p37
aV"The question before us is not whether the market
p38
aVis a force for good or ill.
p39
aVIts power to generate wealth and to expand freedom
p40
aVis unmatched."
p41
aVThus, there's understandably
p42
aVa deep-seated presumption among Westerners
p43
aVthat the whole world will decide to adopt
p44
aVprivate capitalism as the model of economic growth,
p45
aVliberal democracy, and will continue
p46
aVto prioritize political rights over economic rights.
p47
aa(lp48
VHowever, to many who live in the emerging markets,
p49
aVthis is an illusion, and even though
p50
aVthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
p51
aVwhich was signed in 1948,
p52
aVwas unanimously adopted,
p53
aVwhat it did was to mask a schism
p54
aVthat has emerged between developed and developing countries,
p55
aVand the ideological beliefs
p56
aVbetween political and economic rights.
p57
aVThis schism has only grown wider.
p58
aVToday, many people who live in the emerging markets,
p59
aVwhere 90 percent of the world's population lives,
p60
aVbelieve that the Western obsession
p61
aVwith political rights is beside the point,
p62
aVand what is actually important
p63
aVis delivering on food, shelter,
p64
aVeducation and healthcare.
p65
aV"Give me liberty or give me death"
p66
aVis all well and good if you can afford it,
p67
aVbut if you're living on less than one dollar a day,
p68
aVyou're far too busy trying to survive
p69
aVand to provide for your family
p70
aVthan to spend your time going around
p71
aVtrying to proclaim and defend democracy.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, I know many people in this room
p74
aVand around the world will think,
p75
aV"Well actually, this is hard to grasp,"
p76
aVbecause private capitalism and liberal democracy
p77
aVare held sacrosanct.
p78
aVBut I ask you today, what would you do
p79
aVif you had to choose?
p80
aVWhat if you had to choose
p81
aVbetween a roof over your head
p82
aVand the right to vote?
p83
aa(lp84
VOver the last 10 years,
p85
aVI've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries,
p86
aVmany of them in the emerging markets,
p87
aVin Latin America, Asia,
p88
aVand my own continent of Africa.
p89
aVI've met with presidents, dissidents,
p90
aVpolicymakers, lawyers, teachers,
p91
aVdoctors and the man on the street,
p92
aVand through these conversations,
p93
aVit's become clear to me
p94
aVthat many people in the emerging markets
p95
aVbelieve that there's actually a split occurring
p96
aVbetween what people believe ideologically
p97
aVin terms of politics and economics in the West
p98
aVand that which people believe in the rest of the world.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, don't get me wrong.
p101
aVI'm not saying people in the emerging markets
p102
aVdon't understand democracy,
p103
aVnor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally
p104
aVlike to pick their presidents or their leaders.
p105
aVOf course they would.
p106
aVHowever, I am saying that on balance,
p107
aVthey worry more about
p108
aVwhere their living standard improvements are going to come from,
p109
aVand how it is their governments can deliver for them,
p110
aVthan whether or not the government
p111
aVwas elected by democracy.
p112
aa(lp113
VThe fact of the matter
p114
aVis that this has become a very poignant question
p115
aVbecause there is for the first time in a long time
p116
aVa real challenge to the Western ideological systems
p117
aVof politics and economics,
p118
aVand this is a system that is embodied by China.
p119
aVAnd rather than have private capitalism, they have state capitalism.
p120
aVInstead of liberal democracy, they have de-prioritized the democratic system.
p121
aVAnd they have also decided to prioritize
p122
aVeconomic rights over political rights.
p123
aVI put it to you today that it is this system
p124
aVthat is embodied by China
p125
aVthat is gathering momentum amongst people
p126
aVin the emerging markets as the system to follow,
p127
aVbecause they believe increasingly
p128
aVthat it is the system
p129
aVthat will promise the best and fastest improvements
p130
aVin living standards in the shortest period of time.
p131
aVIf you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments
p132
aVexplaining to you first
p133
aVwhy economically they've come to this belief.
p134
aa(lp135
VFirst of all, it's China's economic performance
p136
aVover the past 30 years.
p137
aVShe's been able to produce record economic growth
p138
aVand meaningfully move many people out of poverty,
p139
aVspecifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty
p140
aVby moving over 300 million people
p141
aVout of indigence.
p142
aVIt's not just in economics,
p143
aVbut it's also in terms of living standards.
p144
aVWe see that in China, 28 percent of people
p145
aVhad secondary school access.
p146
aVToday, it's closer to 82 percent.
p147
aVSo in its totality, economic improvement
p148
aVhas been quite significant.
p149
aa(lp150
VSecond, China has been able
p151
aVto meaningfully improve its income inequality
p152
aVwithout changing the political construct.
p153
aVToday, the United States and China
p154
aVare the two leading economies in the world.
p155
aVThey have vastly different political systems
p156
aVand different economic systems,
p157
aVone with private capitalism,
p158
aVanother one broadly with state capitalism.
p159
aVHowever, these two countries
p160
aVhave the identical GINI Coefficient,
p161
aVwhich is a measure of income equality.
p162
aVPerhaps what is more disturbing
p163
aVis that China's income equality
p164
aVhas been improving in recent times,
p165
aVwhereas that of the United States
p166
aVhas been declining.
p167
aa(lp168
VThirdly, people in the emerging markets
p169
aVlook at China's amazing and legendary
p170
aVinfrastructure rollout.
p171
aVThis is not just about China
p172
aVbuilding roads and ports and railways
p173
aVin her own country \u2014
p174
aVshe's been able to build 85,000 kilometers
p175
aVof road network in China
p176
aVand surpass that of the United States \u2014
p177
aVbut even if you look to places like Africa,
p178
aVChina has been able to help tar the distance
p179
aVof Cape Town to Cairo,
p180
aVwhich is 9,000 miles,
p181
aVor three times the distance of New York to California.
p182
aVNow this is something that people can see and point to.
p183
aVPerhaps it's no surprise
p184
aVthat in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,
p185
aVAfricans in 10 countries said
p186
aVthey thought that the Chinese were doing
p187
aVamazing things to improve their livelihoods
p188
aVby wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.
p189
aa(lp190
VFinally, China is also providing innovative solutions
p191
aVto age-old social problems that the world faces.
p192
aVIf you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,
p193
aVyou find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics
p194
aVcontinue to be a stumbling block
p195
aVto the delivery of medicine and healthcare
p196
aVin the rural areas.
p197
aVHowever, through a network of state-owned enterprises,
p198
aVthe Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,
p199
aVusing their companies
p200
aVto help deliver on these healthcare solutions.
p201
aa(lp202
VLadies and gentlemen, it's no surprise
p203
aVthat around the world, people are pointing at what China is doing and saying,
p204
aV"I like that. I want that.
p205
aVI want to be able to do what China's doing.
p206
aVThat is the system that seems to work."
p207
aVI'm here to also tell you
p208
aVthat there are lots of shifts occurring
p209
aVaround what China is doing
p210
aVin the democratic stance.
p211
aVIn particular, there is growing doubt
p212
aVamong people in the emerging markets,
p213
aVwhen people now believe that democracy
p214
aVis no longer to be viewed
p215
aVas a prerequisite for economic growth.
p216
aVIn fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,
p217
aVnot just China, have shown that actually,
p218
aVit's economic growth that is a prerequisite
p219
aVfor democracy.
p220
aVIn a recent study, the evidence has shown
p221
aVthat income is the greatest determinant
p222
aVof how long a democracy can last.
p223
aVThe study found that if your per capita income
p224
aVis about 1,000 dollars a year,
p225
aVyour democracy will last about eight and a half years.
p226
aVIf your per capita income is between
p227
aV2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,
p228
aVthen you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy.
p229
aVAnd only if your per capita income
p230
aVis above 6,000 dollars a year
p231
aVwill you have democracy come hell or high water.
p232
aa(lp233
VWhat this is telling us
p234
aVis that we need to first establish a middle class
p235
aVthat is able to hold the government accountable.
p236
aVBut perhaps it's also telling us
p237
aVthat we should be worried about going
p238
aVaround the world and shoehorning democracy,
p239
aVbecause ultimately we run the risk
p240
aVof ending up with illiberal democracies,
p241
aVdemocracies that in some sense
p242
aVcould be worse than the authoritarian governments
p243
aVthat they seek to replace.
p244
aa(lp245
VThe evidence around illiberal democracies
p246
aVis quite depressing.
p247
aVFreedom House finds that although 50 percent
p248
aVof the world's countries today are democratic,
p249
aV70 percent of those countries are illiberal
p250
aVin the sense that people don't have free speech
p251
aVor freedom of movement.
p252
aVBut also, we're finding from Freedom House
p253
aVin a study that they published last year
p254
aVthat freedom has been on the decline
p255
aVevery year for the past seven years.
p256
aa(lp257
VWhat this says
p258
aVis that for people like me
p259
aVwho care about liberal democracy,
p260
aVis we've got to find a more sustainable way
p261
aVof ensuring that we have a sustainable form
p262
aVof democracy in a liberal way,
p263
aVand that has its roots in economics.
p264
aVBut it also says that as China moves
p265
aVtoward being the largest economy in the world,
p266
aVsomething that is expected to happen
p267
aVby experts in 2016,
p268
aVthat this schism between the political
p269
aVand economic ideologies of the West and the rest
p270
aVis likely to widen.
p271
aa(lp272
VWhat might that world look like?
p273
aVWell, the world could look like
p274
aVmore state involvement and state capitalism;
p275
aVgreater protectionisms of nation-states;
p276
aVbut also, as I just pointed out a moment ago,
p277
aVever-declining political rights
p278
aVand individual rights.
p279
aa(lp280
VThe question that is left for us in general
p281
aVis, what then should the West be doing?
p282
aVAnd I suggest that they have two options.
p283
aVThe West can either compete or cooperate.
p284
aVIf the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,
p285
aVand in effect go around the world
p286
aVand continue to try and push an agenda
p287
aVof private capitalism and liberal democracy,
p288
aVthis is basically going against headwinds,
p289
aVbut it also would be a natural stance
p290
aVfor the West to take
p291
aVbecause in many ways it is the antithesis
p292
aVof the Chinese model
p293
aVof de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.
p294
aVNow the fact of the matter is,
p295
aVif the West decides to compete,
p296
aVit will create a wider schism.
p297
aVThe other option is for the West to cooperate,
p298
aVand by cooperating I mean
p299
aVgiving the emerging market countries the flexibility
p300
aVto figure out in an organic way
p301
aVwhat political and economic system
p302
aVworks best for them.
p303
aa(lp304
VNow I'm sure some of you in the room
p305
aVwill be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,
p306
aVand this is a way, in other words,
p307
aVfor the West to take a back seat.
p308
aVBut I put it to you
p309
aVthat if the United States and European countries
p310
aVwant to remain globally influential,
p311
aVthey may have to consider cooperating
p312
aVin the short term in order to compete,
p313
aVand by that, they might have to focus
p314
aVmore aggressively on economic outcomes
p315
aVto help create the middle class
p316
aVand therefore be able to hold government accountable
p317
aVand create the democracies that we really want.
p318
aa(lp319
VThe fact of the matter is that
p320
aVinstead of going around the world
p321
aVand haranguing countries for engaging with China,
p322
aVthe West should be encouraging its own businesses
p323
aVto trade and invest in these regions.
p324
aVInstead of criticizing China for bad behavior,
p325
aVthe West should be showing how it is
p326
aVthat their own system of politics and economics
p327
aVis the superior one.
p328
aVAnd instead of shoehorning democracy
p329
aVaround the world,
p330
aVperhaps the West should take a leaf
p331
aVout of its own history book
p332
aVand remember that it takes a lot of patience
p333
aVin order to develop the models
p334
aVand the systems that you have today.
p335
aVIndeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer
p336
aVreminds us that it took the United States
p337
aVnearly 170 years
p338
aVfrom the time that the Constitution was written
p339
aVfor there to be equal rights in the United States.
p340
aVSome people would argue that today
p341
aVthere is still no equal rights.
p342
aVIn fact, there are groups who would argue
p343
aVthat they still do not have equal rights under the law.
p344
aa(lp345
VAt its very best,
p346
aVthe Western model speaks for itself.
p347
aVIt's the model that put food on the table.
p348
aVIt's the refrigerators.
p349
aVIt put a man on the moon.
p350
aVBut the fact of the matter is,
p351
aValthough people back in the day
p352
aVused to point at the Western countries and say,
p353
aV"I want that, I like that,"
p354
aVthere's now a new person in town
p355
aVin the form of a country, China.
p356
aVToday, generations are looking at China
p357
aVand saying, "China can produce infrastructure,
p358
aVChina can produce economic growth,
p359
aVand we like that."
p360
aa(lp361
VBecause ultimately, the question before us,
p362
aVand the question before
p363
aVseven billion people on the planet
p364
aVis, how can we create prosperity?
p365
aVPeople who care and will pivot towards the model
p366
aVof politics and economics
p367
aVin a very rational way,
p368
aVto those models that will ensure
p369
aVthat they can have better living standards
p370
aVin the shortest period of time.
p371
aa(lp372
VAs you leave here today,
p373
aVI would like to leave you
p374
aVwith a very personal message,
p375
aVwhich is what it is that I believe
p376
aVwe should be doing as individuals,
p377
aVand this is really about being open-minded,
p378
aVopen-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams
p379
aVof creating prosperity for people around the world,
p380
aVcreating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty
p381
aVfor hundreds of millions of people,
p382
aVhas to be based in being open-minded,
p383
aVbecause these systems have good things
p384
aVand they have bad things.
p385
aa(lp386
VJust to illustrate,
p387
aVI went into my annals of myself.
p388
aVThat's a picture of me.
p389
aa(lp390
VAwww. (Laughter)
p391
aa(lp392
VI was born and raised in Zambia in 1969.
p393
aVAt the time of my birth,
p394
aVblacks were not issued birth certificates,
p395
aVand that law only changed in 1973.
p396
aVThis is an affidavit from the Zambian government.
p397
aVI bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years,
p398
aVI've gone from not being recognized as a human being
p399
aVto standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today
p400
aVto talk to you about my views.
p401
aVIn this vein, we can increase economic growth.
p402
aVWe can meaningfully put a dent in poverty.
p403
aVBut also, it's going to require
p404
aVthat we look at our assumptions,
p405
aVassumptions and strictures that we've grown up with
p406
aVaround democracy, around private capitalism,
p407
aVaround what creates economic growth
p408
aVand reduces poverty and creates freedoms.
p409
aVWe might have to tear those books up
p410
aVand start to look at other options
p411
aVand be open-minded to seek the truth.
p412
aVUltimately, it's about transforming the world
p413
aVand making it a better place.
p414

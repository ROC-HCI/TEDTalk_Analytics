VI'm going to start by asking you a question:
p5
aVIs anyone familiar with the blue algae problem?
p6
aVOkay, so most of you are.
p7
aVI think we can all agree it's a serious issue.
p8
aVNobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water,
p9
aVor swim in a blue algae-infested lake.
p10
aVRight?
p11
aa(lp12
VI hope you won't be disappointed,
p13
aVbut today, I won't be talking about blue algae.
p14
aVInstead, I'll be talking about the main cause
p15
aVat the root of this issue,
p16
aVwhich I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis.
p17
aVWhy have I chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today?
p18
aVFor the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it.
p19
aVAnd by the end of my presentation, I hope that the general public
p20
aVwill be more aware of this crisis and this issue.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, the problem is that if I ask,
p23
aVwhy do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae?
p24
aVThe answer is that it comes from how we farm.
p25
aVWe use fertilizers in our farming, chemical fertilizers.
p26
aVWhy do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture?
p27
aVBasically, to help plants grow and to produce a better yield.
p28
aVThe issue is that this is set to engender
p29
aVan environmental problem that is without precedent.
p30
aa(lp31
VBefore going further, let me give you a crash course in plant biology.
p32
aVSo, what does a plant need in order to grow?
p33
aVA plant, quite simply, needs light, it needs CO2,
p34
aVbut even more importantly, it needs nutrients,
p35
aVwhich it draws from the soil.
p36
aVSeveral of these nutrients are essential chemical elements:
p37
aVphosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.
p38
aVSo, the plant\u2019s roots will extract these resources.
p39
aa(lp40
VToday I'll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus.
p41
aVWhy phosphorus in particular?
p42
aVBecause it is the most problematic chemical element.
p43
aVBy the end of my presentation, you will have seen
p44
aVwhat these problems are, and where we are today.
p45
aa(lp46
VPhosphorus is a chemical element
p47
aVthat is essential to life. This is a very important point.
p48
aVI\u2019d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is.
p49
aVPhosphorus is a key component in several molecules,
p50
aVin many of our molecules of life.
p51
aVExperts in the field will know
p52
aVthat cellular communication is phosphorus-based \u2014
p53
aVphosphorylation, dephosphorylation.
p54
aVCell membranes are phosphorus-based: These are called phospholipids.
p55
aVThe energy in all living things, ATP, is phosphorus-based.
p56
aVAnd more importantly still, phosphorus is a key component of DNA,
p57
aVsomething everyone is familiar with, and which is shown in this image.
p58
aVDNA is our genetic heritage.
p59
aVIt is extremely important, and once again, phosphorus is a key player.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, where do we find this phosphorus?
p62
aVAs humans, where do we find it?
p63
aVAs I explained earlier,
p64
aVplants extract phosphorus from the soil, through water.
p65
aVSo, we humans get it from the things we eat:
p66
aVplants, vegetables, fruits,
p67
aVand also from eggs, meat and milk.
p68
aVIt\u2019s true that some humans eat better than others.
p69
aVSome are happier than others.
p70
aVAnd now, looking at this picture, which speaks for itself,
p71
aVwe see modern agriculture,
p72
aVwhich I also refer to as intensive agriculture.
p73
aVIntensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers.
p74
aVWithout them, we would not manage to produce enough
p75
aVto feed the world's population.
p76
aVSpeaking of humans, there are currently 7 billion of us on Earth.
p77
aVIn less than 40 years, there will be 9 billion of us.
p78
aVAnd the question is a simple one: Do we have enough phosphorus
p79
aVto feed our future generations?
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, in order to understand these issues, where do we find our phosphorus?
p82
aVLet me explain.
p83
aVBut first, let\u2019s just suppose
p84
aVthat we are using 100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus.
p85
aVOnly 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant. Eighty-five percent is lost.
p86
aVIt goes into the soil, ending its journey in the lakes,
p87
aVresulting in lakes with extra phosphorus, which leads to the blue algae problem.
p88
aVSo, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a problem here, something that is illogical.
p89
aVA hundred percent of the phosphorus is used, but only 15 percent goes to the plant.
p90
aVYou\u2019re going to tell me it\u2019s wasteful.
p91
aVYes, it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive.
p92
aVNobody wants to throw their money out the window,
p93
aVbut unfortunately that's what is happening here.
p94
aVEighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost.
p95
aVModern agriculture depends on phosphorus.
p96
aVAnd because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant, all the rest is lost,
p97
aVwe have to add more and more.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, where will we get this phosphorus from?
p100
aVBasically, we get it out of mines.
p101
aVThis is the cover of an extraordinary article
p102
aVpublished in Nature in 2009,
p103
aVwhich really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis.
p104
aVPhosphorus, a nutrient essential to life, which is becoming increasingly scarce,
p105
aVyet nobody is talking about it.
p106
aVAnd everyone agrees: Politicians and scientists are in agreement
p107
aVthat we are headed for a phosphorus crisis.
p108
aa(lp109
VWhat you are seeing here is an open-pit mine in the U.S.,
p110
aVand to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine,
p111
aVif you look in the top right-hand corner, the little crane you can see,
p112
aVthat is a giant crane.
p113
aVSo that really puts it into perspective.
p114
aVSo, we get phosphorus from mines.
p115
aVAnd if I make a comparison with oil,
p116
aVthere\u2019s an oil crisis, we talk about it, we talk about global warming,
p117
aVyet we never mention the phosphorus crisis.
p118
aVTo come back to the oil problem, oil is something we can replace.
p119
aVWe can use biofuels, or solar power,
p120
aVor hydropower, but phosphorus is an essential element,
p121
aVindispensable to life, and we can\u2019t replace it.
p122
aa(lp123
VWhat is the current state of the world's phosphorus reserves?
p124
aVThis graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today.
p125
aVThe black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves.
p126
aVIn 2030, we\u2019ll reach the peak.
p127
aVBy the end of this century, it will all be gone.
p128
aVThe dotted line shows where we are today.
p129
aVAs you can see, they meet in 2030, I\u2019ll be retired by then.
p130
aVBut we are indeed heading for a major crisis,
p131
aVand I\u2019d like people to become aware of this problem.
p132
aa(lp133
VDo we have a solution?
p134
aVWhat are we to do? We are faced with a paradox.
p135
aVLess and less phosphorus will be available.
p136
aVBy 2050 there will be 9 billion of us,
p137
aVand according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,
p138
aVwe will need to produce twice as much food in 2050 than we do today.
p139
aVSo, we will have less phosphorus, but we'll need to produce more food.
p140
aVWhat should we do?
p141
aVIt truly is a paradoxical situation.
p142
aVDo we have a solution, or an alternative
p143
aVwhich will allow us to optimize phosphorus use?
p144
aa(lp145
VRemember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.
p146
aVThe solution I'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time,
p147
aVeven before plants existed on Earth,
p148
aVand it's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious,
p149
aVvery simple, and yet also extremely complex.
p150
aVI've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over 16 years now.
p151
aVIt has led me to further my research
p152
aVand to use it as a model for my laboratory research.
p153
aa(lp154
VThis mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots.
p155
aVBy symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association
p156
aVwhich is also called mycorrhiza.
p157
aVThis slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza.
p158
aVYou\u2019re looking at the root of wheat,
p159
aVone of the world\u2019s most important plants.
p160
aVNormally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself.
p161
aVIt will go in search of phosphorus,
p162
aVbut only within the one millimeter which surrounds it.
p163
aVBeyond one millimeter, the root is ineffective.
p164
aVIt cannot go further in its search for phosphorus.
p165
aVNow, imagine this tiny, microscopic mushroom.
p166
aVIt grows much faster,
p167
aVand is much better designed to seek out phosphorus.
p168
aVIt can go beyond the root\u2019s one-millimeter scope
p169
aVto seek out phosphorus.
p170
aa(lp171
VI haven\u2019t invented anything at all;
p172
aVit's a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years.
p173
aVAnd over time, this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out
p174
aVeven the tiniest trace of phosphorus, and to put it to use,
p175
aVto make it available to the plant.
p176
aVWhat you\u2019re seeing here, in the real world, is a carrot root,
p177
aVand the mushroom with its very fine filaments.
p178
aVLooking closer, we can see that this mushroom
p179
aVis very gentle in its penetration.
p180
aVIt will proliferate between the root's cells,
p181
aVeventually penetrating a cell
p182
aVand starting to form a typical arbuscular structure,
p183
aVwhich will considerably increase the exchange interface
p184
aVbetween the plant and the mushroom.
p185
aVAnd it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur.
p186
aVIt\u2019s a win-win trade:
p187
aVI give you phosphorus, and you feed me.
p188
aVTrue symbiosis.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow let's add a mycorrhiza plant
p191
aVinto the diagram I used earlier.
p192
aVAnd instead of using a 100 percent dose, I\u2019m going to reduce it to 25 percent.
p193
aVYou\u2019ll see that of this 25 percent, most will benefit the plant,
p194
aVmore than 90 percent.
p195
aVA very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil.
p196
aVThat's completely natural.
p197
aVWhat's more is that in certain cases, we don't even need to add phosphorus.
p198
aa(lp199
VIf you recall the graphs I showed you earlier,
p200
aV85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil,
p201
aVand the plants are unable to access it.
p202
aVEven though it is present in the soil, it is in insoluble form.
p203
aVThe plant is only able to seek out soluble forms.
p204
aVThe mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form
p205
aVand making it available for the plant to use.
p206
aVTo further support my argument, here is a picture that speaks for itself.
p207
aVThese are trials in a field of sorghum.
p208
aVOn the left side, you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture,
p209
aVwith a 100 percent phosphorus dose.
p210
aVOn the other side, the dose was reduced to 50 percent,
p211
aVand just look at the yield.
p212
aVWith only a half-dose, we achieved a better yield.
p213
aa(lp214
VThis is to show you that this method works.
p215
aVAnd in some cases, in Cuba, Mexico and India,
p216
aVthe dose can be reduced to 25 percent, and in several other cases,
p217
aVthere's no need to add any phosphorus at all,
p218
aVbecause the mushrooms are so well adapted
p219
aVto finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil.
p220
aVThis is an example of soy production in Canada.
p221
aVMycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other.
p222
aVAnd here, where blue indicates a better yield, and yellow a weaker yield.
p223
aVThe black rectangle is the plot
p224
aVfrom which the mycorrhiza was added.
p225
aVIn other words, as I already said, I have invented nothing.
p226
aVMycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years,
p227
aVand it has even helped modern-day plant species to diversify.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo, this it isn't something that is still undergoing lab tests.
p230
aVMycorrhiza exists, it works,
p231
aVit's produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide.
p232
aVThe problem is that people are not aware of it.
p233
aVPeople like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem.
p234
aVWe have a technology that works,
p235
aVand one that, if used correctly, will alleviate some of the pressure
p236
aVwe are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves.
p237
aa(lp238
VIn conclusion, I am a scientist and a dreamer.
p239
aVI'm passionate about this topic.
p240
aVSo if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is,
p241
aVwhich will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak,
p242
aVit would be that we use one label, "Made with mycorrhiza,"
p243
aVand that my children and grandchildren
p244
aVbuy products bearing that label too.
p245
aa(lp246
VThank you for your attention.

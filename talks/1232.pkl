VWhat I want to talk about today is one idea.
p5
aVIt's an idea for a new kind of school,
p6
aVwhich turns on its head much of our conventional thinking
p7
aVabout what schools are for and how they work.
p8
aVAnd it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon.
p9
aVWhere it comes from
p10
aVis an organization called the Young Foundation,
p11
aVwhich, over many decades,
p12
aVhas come up with many innovations in education, like the Open University
p13
aVand things like Extended Schools,
p14
aVSchools for Social Entrepreneurs, Summer Universities
p15
aVand the School of Everything.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd about five years ago, we asked
p18
aVwhat was the most important need for innovation
p19
aVin schooling here in the U.K.
p20
aVAnd we felt the most important priority
p21
aVwas to bring together two sets of problems.
p22
aVOne was large numbers of bored teenagers
p23
aVwho just didn't like school,
p24
aVcouldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school
p25
aVand future jobs.
p26
aVAnd employers who kept complaining
p27
aVthat the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work,
p28
aVdidn't have the right attitudes and experience.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd so we try to ask:
p31
aVWhat kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in,
p32
aVnot fighting to stay out?
p33
aVAnd after hundreds of conversations
p34
aVwith teenagers and teachers and parents
p35
aVand employers and schools
p36
aVfrom Paraguay to Australia,
p37
aVand looking at some of the academic research,
p38
aVwhich showed the importance
p39
aVof what's now called non-cognitive skills \u2014
p40
aVthe skills of motivation, resilience \u2014
p41
aVand that these are as important
p42
aVas the cognitive skills \u2014 formal academic skills \u2014
p43
aVwe came up with an answer, a very simple answer in a way,
p44
aVwhich we called the Studio School.
p45
aVAnd we called it a studio school
p46
aVto go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance
p47
aVwhere work and learning are integrated.
p48
aVYou work by learning,
p49
aVand you learn by working.
p50
aVAnd the design we came up with had the following characteristics.
p51
aa(lp52
VFirst of all, we wanted small schools \u2014
p53
aVabout 300, 400 pupils \u2014
p54
aV14 to 19 year-olds,
p55
aVand critically, about 80 percent of the curriculum done
p56
aVnot through sitting in classrooms,
p57
aVbut through real-life, practical projects,
p58
aVworking on commission
p59
aVto businesses, NGO's and others.
p60
aVThat every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers,
p61
aVwho would have timetables
p62
aVmuch more like a work environment in a business.
p63
aVAnd all of this will be done within the public system,
p64
aVfunded by public money,
p65
aVbut independently run.
p66
aVAnd all at no extra cost, no selection,
p67
aVand allowing the pupils the route into university,
p68
aVeven if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs
p69
aVand have manual jobs as well.
p70
aVUnderlying it was some very simple ideas
p71
aVthat large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things,
p72
aVthey learn best in teams
p73
aVand they learn best by doing things for real \u2014
p74
aVall the opposite of what mainstream schooling
p75
aVactually does.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow that was a nice idea,
p78
aVso we moved into the rapid prototyping phase.
p79
aVWe tried it out,
p80
aVfirst in Luton \u2014
p81
aVfamous for its airport and not much else, I fear \u2014
p82
aVand in Blackpool \u2014 famous for its beaches and leisure.
p83
aVAnd what we found \u2014 and we got quite a lot of things wrong
p84
aVand then improved them \u2014
p85
aVbut we found that the young people loved it.
p86
aVThey found it much more motivational, much more exciting
p87
aVthan traditional education.
p88
aVAnd perhaps most important of all,
p89
aVtwo years later when the exam results came through,
p90
aVthe pupils who had been put on these field trials
p91
aVwho were in the lowest performing groups
p92
aVhad jumped right to the top \u2014
p93
aVin fact, pretty much at the top decile of performance
p94
aVin terms of GCSE's,
p95
aVwhich is the British marking system.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow not surprisingly,
p98
aVthat influenced some people to think we were onto something.
p99
aVThe minister of education
p100
aVdown south in London
p101
aVdescribed himself as a "big fan."
p102
aVAnd the business organizations thought we were onto something
p103
aVin terms of a way of preparing children much better
p104
aVfor real-life work today.
p105
aVAnd indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce
p106
aVis now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust
p107
aVand helping it, not just with big businesses,
p108
aVbut small businesses all over the country.
p109
aa(lp110
VWe started with two schools.
p111
aVThat's grown this year to about 10.
p112
aVAnd next year, we're expecting about 35 schools
p113
aVopen across England,
p114
aVand another 40 areas
p115
aVwant to have their own schools opening \u2014
p116
aVa pretty rapid spread
p117
aVof this idea.
p118
aVInterestingly,
p119
aVit's happened almost entirely without media coverage.
p120
aVIt's happened almost entirely without big money behind it.
p121
aVIt spread almost entirely through word of mouth, virally,
p122
aVacross teachers, parents,
p123
aVpeople involved in education.
p124
aVAnd it spread because of the power of an idea \u2014
p125
aVso the very, very simple idea
p126
aVabout turning education on its head
p127
aVand putting the things which were marginal,
p128
aVthings like working in teams, doing practical projects,
p129
aVand putting them right at the heart of learning,
p130
aVrather than on the edges.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow there's a whole set of new schools
p133
aVopening up this autumn.
p134
aVThis is one from Yorkshire
p135
aVwhere, in fact, my nephew, I hope, will be able to attend it.
p136
aVAnd this one is focused
p137
aVon creative and media industries.
p138
aVOther ones have a focus on health care,
p139
aVtourism, engineering
p140
aVand other fields.
p141
aa(lp142
VWe think we're onto something.
p143
aVIt's not perfect yet,
p144
aVbut we think this is one idea
p145
aVwhich can transform the lives
p146
aVof thousands, possibly millions, of teenagers
p147
aVwho are really bored by schooling.
p148
aVIt doesn't animate them.
p149
aVThey're not like all of you who can sit in rows
p150
aVand hear things said to you for hour after hour.
p151
aVThey want to do things, they want to get their hands dirty,
p152
aVthey want education to be for real.
p153
aVAnd my hope is that some of you out there
p154
aVmay be able to help us.
p155
aa(lp156
VWe feel we're on the beginning of a journey
p157
aVof experiment and improvement
p158
aVto turn the Studio School idea
p159
aVinto something which is present,
p160
aVnot as a universal answer for every child,
p161
aVbut at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world.
p162
aVAnd I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen.
p163
aa(lp164
VThank you very much.

VThe first half of the 20th century
p5
aVwas an absolute disaster in human affairs,
p6
aVa cataclysm.
p7
aVWe had the First World War,
p8
aVthe Great Depression,
p9
aVthe Second World War
p10
aVand the rise of the communist nations.
p11
aVAnd each one of these forces
p12
aVsplit the world, tore the world apart,
p13
aVdivided the world.
p14
aVAnd they threw up walls \u2014
p15
aVpolitical walls, trade walls,
p16
aVtransportation walls,
p17
aVcommunication walls, iron curtains \u2014
p18
aVwhich divided peoples and nations.
p19
aa(lp20
VIt was only in the second half of the 20th century
p21
aVthat we slowly began to pull ourselves
p22
aVout of this abyss.
p23
aVTrade walls began to come tumbling down.
p24
aVHere are some data on tariffs:
p25
aVstarting at 40 percent, coming down to less than 5 percent.
p26
aVWe globalized the world. And what does that mean?
p27
aVIt means that we extended cooperation
p28
aVacross national boundaries;
p29
aVwe made the world more cooperative.
p30
aVTransportation walls came tumbling down.
p31
aVYou know in 1950 the typical ship carried
p32
aV5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.
p33
aVToday a container ship can carry 150,000 tons;
p34
aVit can be manned with a smaller crew;
p35
aVand unloaded faster than ever before.
p36
aVCommunication walls, I don't have to tell you \u2014 the Internet \u2014
p37
aVhave come tumbling down.
p38
aVAnd of course the iron curtains,
p39
aVpolitical walls have come tumbling down.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow all of this has been tremendous for the world.
p42
aVTrade has increased.
p43
aVHere is just a little bit of data.
p44
aVIn 1990, exports from China to the United States:
p45
aV15 billion dollars.
p46
aVBy 2007: over 300 billion dollars.
p47
aVAnd perhaps most remarkably,
p48
aVat the beginning of the 21st century,
p49
aVreally for the first time in modern history,
p50
aVgrowth extended to almost all parts of the world.
p51
aVSo China, I've already mentioned,
p52
aVbeginning around 1978, around the time of the death of Mao,
p53
aVgrowth \u2014 ten percent a year.
p54
aVYear after year after year,
p55
aVabsolutely incredible.
p56
aVNever before in human history
p57
aVhave so many people been raised out of
p58
aVsuch great poverty as happened in China.
p59
aVChina is the world's greatest anti-poverty program
p60
aVover the last three decades.
p61
aVIndia, starting a little bit later,
p62
aVbut in 1990, begetting tremendous growth.
p63
aVIncomes at that time
p64
aVless than $1,000 per year.
p65
aVAnd over the next 18 years
p66
aVhave almost tripled.
p67
aVGrowth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible.
p68
aVNow Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa \u2014
p69
aVSub-Saharan Africa
p70
aVhas been the area of the world
p71
aVmost resistant to growth.
p72
aVAnd we can see the tragedy of Africa
p73
aVin the first few bars here.
p74
aVGrowth was negative.
p75
aVPeople were actually getting poorer than their parents,
p76
aVand sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been.
p77
aVBut at the end of the 20th century,
p78
aVthe beginning of the 21st century,
p79
aVwe saw growth in Africa.
p80
aVAnd I think, as you'll see, there's reasons for optimism,
p81
aVbecause I believe that the best is yet to come.
p82
aVNow why.
p83
aa(lp84
VOn the cutting edge today
p85
aVit's new ideas which are driving growth.
p86
aVAnd by that I mean it's
p87
aVproducts for which the research and development costs
p88
aVare really high, and the manufacturing costs are low.
p89
aVMore than ever before it is these types of ideas
p90
aVwhich are driving growth on the cutting edge.
p91
aVNow ideas have this amazing property.
p92
aVThomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well.
p93
aVHe said, "He who receives an idea from me
p94
aVreceives instruction himself, without lessening mine.
p95
aVAs he who lights his candle at mine
p96
aVreceives light without darkening me."
p97
aVOr to put it slightly differently:
p98
aVone apple feeds one man,
p99
aVbut an idea can feed the world.
p100
aVNow this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters.
p101
aVThis is practically the model of TED.
p102
aVBut what is new is that the greater function of ideas
p103
aVis going to drive growth even more than ever before.
p104
aVThis provides a reason why
p105
aVtrade and globalization
p106
aVare even more important, more powerful than ever before,
p107
aVand are going to increase growth more than ever before.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd to explain why this is so, I have a question.
p110
aVSuppose that there are two diseases:
p111
aVone of them is rare, the other one is common,
p112
aVbut if they are not treated they are equally severe.
p113
aVIf you had to choose, which would you rather have:
p114
aVthe common disease or the rare disease?
p115
aVCommon, the common \u2014 I think that's absolutely right,
p116
aVand why? Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases
p117
aVthan there are to treat rare diseases.
p118
aVThe reason for this is incentives.
p119
aVIt costs about the same to produce a new drug
p120
aVwhether that drug treats 1,000 people,
p121
aV100,000 people, or a million people.
p122
aVBut the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people.
p123
aVSo the incentives are much larger
p124
aVto produce drugs which treat more people.
p125
aVTo put this differently: larger markets save lives.
p126
aVIn this case misery truly does love company.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow think about the following:
p129
aVif China and India were as rich as the United States is today,
p130
aVthe market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now.
p131
aVNow we are not there yet, but it is happening.
p132
aVAs other countries become richer
p133
aVthe demand for these pharmaceuticals
p134
aVis going to increase tremendously.
p135
aVAnd that means an increase incentive to do research and development,
p136
aVwhich benefits everyone in the world.
p137
aVLarger markets increase the incentive
p138
aVto produce all kinds of ideas,
p139
aVwhether it's software, whether it's a computer chip,
p140
aVwhether it's a new design.
p141
aVFor the Hollywood people in the audience,
p142
aVthis even explains why action movies
p143
aVhave larger budgets than comedies:
p144
aVit's because action movies translate easier
p145
aVinto other languages and other cultures,
p146
aVso the market for those movies is larger.
p147
aVPeople are willing to invest more,
p148
aVand the budgets are larger.
p149
aa(lp150
VAlright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive
p151
aVto produce new ideas,
p152
aVhow do we maximize that incentive?
p153
aVIt's by having one world market, by globalizing the world.
p154
aVThe way I like to put this is:
p155
aVone idea. Ideas are meant to be shared,
p156
aVso one idea can serve one world, one market.
p157
aVOne idea, one world, one market.
p158
aVWell how else can we create new ideas?
p159
aVThat's one reason.
p160
aVGlobalize trade.
p161
aVHow else can we create new ideas?
p162
aVWell, more idea creators.
p163
aVNow idea creators, they come from all walks of life.
p164
aVArtists and innovators \u2014 many of the people you've seen on this stage.
p165
aVI'm going to focus on scientists and engineers
p166
aVbecause I have some data on that, and I'm a data person.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, today, less than one-tenth of one percent
p169
aVof the world's population are scientists and engineers.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVThe United States has been an idea leader.
p172
aVA large fraction of those people are in the United States.
p173
aVBut the U.S. is losing its idea leadership.
p174
aVAnd for that I am very grateful.
p175
aVThat is a good thing.
p176
aVIt is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader
p177
aVbecause for too long the United States,
p178
aVand a handful of other developed countries,
p179
aVhave shouldered the entire burden
p180
aVof research and development.
p181
aVBut consider the following:
p182
aVif the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now
p183
aVthere would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers
p184
aVcontributing to ideas which benefit everyone,
p185
aVwhich are shared by everyone.
p186
aVI think of the great Indian mathematician, Ramanujan.
p187
aVHow many Ramanujans are there in India today
p188
aVtoiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves,
p189
aVwhen they could be feeding the world?
p190
aVNow we're not there yet.
p191
aVBut it is going to happen in this century.
p192
aVThe real tragedy of the last century is this:
p193
aVif you think about the world's population
p194
aVas a giant computer, a massively parallel processor,
p195
aVthen the great tragedy has been
p196
aVthat billions of our processors have been off line.
p197
aVBut in this century China is coming on line.
p198
aVIndia is coming on line.
p199
aVAfrica is coming on line.
p200
aVWe will see an Einstein in Africa in this century.
p201
aa(lp202
VHere is just some data. This is China.
p203
aV1996: less than one million
p204
aVnew university students in China per year;
p205
aV2006: over five million.
p206
aVNow think what this means.
p207
aVThis means we all benefit when another country gets rich.
p208
aVWe should not fear other countries becoming wealthy.
p209
aVThat is something that we should embrace \u2014
p210
aVa wealthy China, a wealthy India, a wealthy Africa.
p211
aVWe need a greater demand for ideas \u2014
p212
aVthose larger markets I was talking about earlier \u2014
p213
aVand a greater supply of ideas for the world.
p214
aVNow you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic.
p215
aVGlobalization is increasing the demand
p216
aVfor ideas, the incentive to create new ideas.
p217
aVInvestments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas.
p218
aa(lp219
VIn fact if you look at world history
p220
aVyou can see some reasons for optimism.
p221
aVFrom about the beginnings of humanity
p222
aVto 1500: zero economic growth, nothing.
p223
aV1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth,
p224
aVbut less in a century
p225
aVthan you expect to see in a year today.
p226
aV1900s: maybe one percent.
p227
aVTwentieth century: a little bit over two percent.
p228
aVTwenty-first century could easily be 3.3, even higher percent.
p229
aVEven at that rate,
p230
aVby 2100 average GDP per capita
p231
aVin the world will be $200,000.
p232
aVThat's not U.S. GDP per capita, which will be over a million,
p233
aVbut world GDP per capita \u2014 $200,000.
p234
aVThat's not that far.
p235
aVWe won't make it.
p236
aVBut some of our grandchildren probably will.
p237
aVAnd I should say,
p238
aVI think this is a rather modest prediction.
p239
aVIn Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy.
p240
aVIn Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth.
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VAlright what about problems?
p244
aVWhat about a great depression?
p245
aVWell let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression.
p246
aVHere is GDP per capita
p247
aVfrom 1900 to 1929.
p248
aVNow let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929,
p249
aVtrying to forecast future growth for the United States,
p250
aVnot knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff,
p251
aVnot knowing that we were about to enter
p252
aVthe greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century.
p253
aVWhat would you have predicted, not knowing this?
p254
aVIf you had based your prediction, your forecast
p255
aVon 1900 to 1929
p256
aVyou'd have predicted something like this.
p257
aVIf you'd been a little more optimistic \u2014
p258
aVsay, based upon the Roaring Twenties \u2014 you'd have said this.
p259
aVSo what actually happened?
p260
aVWe went off a cliff but we recovered.
p261
aVIn fact in the second half of the 20th century
p262
aVgrowth was even higher than anything you would have predicted
p263
aVbased upon the first half of the 20th century.
p264
aVSo growth can wash away
p265
aVeven what appears to be a great depression.
p266
aa(lp267
VAlright. What else?
p268
aVOil. Oil. This was a big topic.
p269
aVWhen I was writing up my notes oil was $140 per barrel.
p270
aVSo people were asking a question. They were saying,
p271
aV"Is China drinking our milkshake?"
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aVAnd there is some truth to this,
p274
aVin the sense that we have something of a finite resource,
p275
aVand increased growth is going to push up demand for that.
p276
aVBut I think I don't have to tell this audience
p277
aVthat a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing.
p278
aVMoreover, as everyone knows,
p279
aVlook \u2014 it's energy, not oil, which counts.
p280
aVAnd higher oil prices mean
p281
aVa greater incentive to invest in energy R&D.
p282
aVYou can see this in the data.
p283
aVAs oil prices go up, energy patents go up.
p284
aVThe world is much better equipped
p285
aVto overcome an increase in the price of oil
p286
aVtoday, than ever in the past,
p287
aVbecause of what I'm talking about.
p288
aVOne idea, one world, one market.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo I'm optimistic
p291
aVso long as we hew to these two ideas:
p292
aVto keep globalizing world markets,
p293
aVkeep extending cooperation across national boundaries,
p294
aVand keep investing in education.
p295
aVNow the United States has a particularly important role
p296
aVto play in this:
p297
aVto keep our education system globalized,
p298
aVto keep our education system open to students from all over the world,
p299
aVbecause our education system
p300
aVis the candle
p301
aVthat other students come to light their own candles.
p302
aVNow remember here what Jefferson said.
p303
aVJefferson said, "When they come
p304
aVand light their candles at ours,
p305
aVthey gain light, and we are not darkened."
p306
aVBut Jefferson wasn't quite right, was he?
p307
aVBecause the truth is,
p308
aVwhen they light their candles at ours,
p309
aVthere is twice as much light available for everyone.
p310
aVSo my view is: Be optimistic.
p311
aVSpread the ideas. Spread the light.
p312
aVThank you.
p313
aV(Applause)

VFive years ago, I experienced a bit
p5
aVof what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.
p6
aVPenn State asked me, a communications teacher,
p7
aVto teach a communications class for engineering students.
p8
aVAnd I was scared. (Laughter)
p9
aVReally scared. Scared of these students with their big brains
p10
aVand their big books and their big, unfamiliar words.
p11
aVBut as these conversations unfolded,
p12
aVI experienced what Alice must have when she went down
p13
aVthat rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.
p14
aVThat's just how I felt as I had those conversations
p15
aVwith the students. I was amazed at the ideas
p16
aVthat they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well.
p17
aVAnd I believe the key to opening that door
p18
aVis great communication.
p19
aa(lp20
VWe desperately need great communication from our
p21
aVscientists and engineers in order to change the world.
p22
aVOur scientists and engineers are the ones
p23
aVthat are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy
p24
aVto environment to health care, among others,
p25
aVand if we don't know about it and understand it,
p26
aVthen the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility
p27
aVas non-scientists to have these interactions.
p28
aVBut these great conversations can't occur if our scientists
p29
aVand engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.
p30
aVSo scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.
p31
aa(lp32
VI want to share a few keys on how you can do that
p33
aVto make sure that we can see that your science is sexy
p34
aVand that your engineering is engaging.
p35
aVFirst question to answer for us: so what?
p36
aVTell us why your science is relevant to us.
p37
aVDon't just tell me that you study trabeculae,
p38
aVbut tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones
p39
aVbecause it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.
p42
aVJargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.
p43
aVSure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say
p44
aV"space and time," which is so much more accessible to us?
p45
aVAnd making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.
p46
aVInstead, as Einstein said, make everything
p47
aVas simple as possible, but no simpler.
p48
aVYou can clearly communicate your science
p49
aVwithout compromising the ideas.
p50
aVA few things to consider are having examples, stories
p51
aVand analogies. Those are ways to engage
p52
aVand excite us about your content.
p53
aVAnd when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.
p54
aVHave you ever wondered why they're called bullet points? (Laughter)
p55
aVWhat do bullets do? Bullets kill,
p56
aVand they will kill your presentation.
p57
aVA slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much
p58
aVon the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.
p59
aVInstead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is
p60
aVmuch more effective. It's showing that the special structure
p61
aVof trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired
p62
aVthe unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
p63
aVAnd the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence
p64
aVthat the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,
p65
aVand then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses
p66
aVand create a deeper sense of understanding
p67
aVof what's being described.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo I think these are just a few keys that can help
p70
aVthe rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland
p71
aVthat is science and engineering.
p72
aVAnd because the engineers that I've worked with have
p73
aVtaught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd,
p74
aVI want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter)
p75
aVTake your science, subtract your bullet points
p76
aVand your jargon, divide by relevance,
p77
aVmeaning share what's relevant to the audience,
p78
aVand multiply it by the passion that you have for
p79
aVthis incredible work that you're doing,
p80
aVand that is going to equal incredible interactions
p81
aVthat are full of understanding.
p82
aVAnd so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved
p83
aVthis equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me. (Laughter)
p84
aVThank you. (Applause)

VThe stories we tell about each other
p5
aVmatter very much.
p6
aVThe stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.
p7
aVAnd most of all,
p8
aVI think the way that we participate in each other's stories
p9
aVis of deep importance.
p10
aVI was six years old
p11
aVwhen I first heard stories about the poor.
p12
aVNow I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,
p13
aVI heard them from my Sunday school teacher
p14
aVand Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.
p15
aVI remember learning that people who were poor
p16
aVneeded something material \u2014
p17
aVfood, clothing, shelter \u2014 that they didn't have.
p18
aVAnd I also was taught, coupled with that,
p19
aVthat it was my job \u2014 this classroom full of five and six year-old children \u2014
p20
aVit was our job, apparently, to help.
p21
aVThis is what Jesus asked of us.
p22
aVAnd then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me."
p23
aVNow I was pretty psyched.
p24
aVI was very eager to be useful in the world \u2014
p25
aVI think we all have that feeling.
p26
aVAnd also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.
p27
aVThat was news to me,
p28
aVand it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut I also learned very soon thereafter
p31
aVthat Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,
p32
aVthe poor would always be with us.
p33
aVThis frustrated and confused me;
p34
aVI felt like I had been just given a homework assignment
p35
aVthat I had to do, and I was excited to do,
p36
aVbut no matter what I would do, I would fail.
p37
aVSo I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,
p38
aVlike maybe I'd misunderstood something here.
p39
aVAnd I felt overwhelmed.
p40
aVAnd for the first time,
p41
aVI began to fear this group of people
p42
aVand to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.
p43
aVI imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals
p44
aVthat were never going away, that would always be with us.
p45
aVThey were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,
p46
aVwhich I was excited to do,
p47
aVbut I didn't know how it was going to work.
p48
aVAnd I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,
p49
aVespecially if the problem was never going away.
p50
aVIn the years following,
p51
aVthe other stories I heard about the poor growing up
p52
aVwere no more positive.
p53
aVFor example, I saw pictures and images
p54
aVfrequently of sadness and suffering.
p55
aVI heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.
p56
aVI heard about disease, I heard about war \u2014
p57
aVthey always seemed to be kind of related.
p58
aVAnd in general,
p59
aVI got this sort of idea
p60
aVthat the poor in the world lived lives
p61
aVthat were wrought with suffering and sadness,
p62
aVdevastation, hopelessness.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,
p65
aVis this predictable response,
p66
aVwhere I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.
p67
aVI started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,
p68
aVbecause I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.
p69
aVAnd I even felt a sense of shame because of that.
p70
aVAnd so naturally,
p71
aVI started to distance myself.
p72
aVI stopped listening to their stories
p73
aVquite as closely as I had before.
p74
aVAnd I stopped expecting things to really change.
p75
aVNow I still gave \u2014 on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.
p76
aVI gave of my time and my money,
p77
aVI gave when solutions were on sale.
p78
aVThe cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.
p79
aVI mean who can argue with that?
p80
aVI gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid
p81
aVand I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough
p82
aVthat I gave to relieve my own suffering,
p83
aVnot someone else's.
p84
aVThe truth be told, I was giving out of that place,
p85
aVnot out of a genuine place of hope
p86
aVand excitement to help and of generosity.
p87
aVIt became a transaction for me,
p88
aVbecame sort of a trade.
p89
aVI was purchasing something \u2014
p90
aVI was buying my right to go on with my day
p91
aVand not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.
p92
aVAnd I think the way that we go through that sometimes
p93
aVcan, first of all,
p94
aVdisembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.
p95
aVAnd it can also turn into a commodity,
p96
aVwhich is a very scary thing.
p97
aVSo as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,
p98
aVwe kind of buy our distance,
p99
aVwe kind of buy our right to go on with our day.
p100
aVI think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.
p101
aVIt can get in the way of our desire
p102
aVto really be meaningful and useful in another person's life
p103
aVand, in short to love.
p104
aa(lp105
VThankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me
p106
aVbecause I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.
p107
aVI know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,
p108
aVbut to give the shorthand version
p109
aVfor any who have not heard him speak,
p110
aVDr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago
p111
aVfor his work pioneering modern microfinance.
p112
aVWhen I heard him speak, it was three years before that.
p113
aVBut basically, microfinance \u2014 if this is new to you as well \u2014
p114
aVthink of that as financial services for the poor.
p115
aVThink of all the things you get at your bank
p116
aVand imagine those products and services
p117
aVtailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.
p118
aVDr. Yunus shared his story,
p119
aVexplaining what that was,
p120
aVand what he had done with his Grameen Bank.
p121
aVHe also talked about, in particular, microlending,
p122
aVwhich is a tiny loan
p123
aVthat could help someone start or grow a business.
p124
aVNow, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.
p125
aVFirst and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world
p126
aVthat, for once, showed me, maybe,
p127
aVa way to interact with someone
p128
aVand to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird
p129
aVand didn't make me feel bad \u2014
p130
aVthat was exciting.
p131
aVBut more importantly, he told stories about the poor
p132
aVthat were different than any stories I had heard before.
p133
aVIn fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.
p134
aVHe was talking about strong, smart,
p135
aVhardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day
p136
aVand were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.
p137
aVAll they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better
p138
aVwas a little bit of capital.
p139
aVIt was an amazing sort of insight for me.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this \u2014
p142
aVit's hard to express now how much that affected me \u2014
p143
aVbut I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,
p144
aVand I moved to East Africa
p145
aVto try to see for myself what this was about.
p146
aVFor the first time, actually, in a long time
p147
aVI wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,
p148
aVand see for myself what their lives were actually about.
p149
aVSo I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
p150
aVinterviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars
p151
aVto start or grow a business.
p152
aVAnd in fact, through those interactions,
p153
aVfor the first time, I was starting to get to be friends
p154
aVwith some of those people in that big amorphous group out there
p155
aVthat was supposed to be far away.
p156
aVI was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.
p157
aVAnd over and over again,
p158
aVas I interviewed them and spent my days with them,
p159
aVI did hear stories of life change
p160
aVand amazing little details of change.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo I would hear from goat herders
p163
aVwho had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.
p164
aVTheir business trajectory would change.
p165
aVThey would make a little bit more money;
p166
aVtheir standard of living
p167
aVwould shift and would get better.
p168
aVAnd they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,
p169
aVlike they would start to send their children to school.
p170
aVThey might be able to buy mosquito nets.
p171
aVMaybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.
p172
aVMaybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea
p173
aVand offer that to me when I came as their guest
p174
aVand that made them feel proud.
p175
aVBut there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,
p176
aVand some days that's what happened \u2014
p177
aVthese beautiful details of life change
p178
aVthat were meaningful to them.
p179
aVThat was another thing that really touched me.
p180
aVIt was really humbling to see for the first time,
p181
aVto really understand
p182
aVthat even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,
p183
aVI probably would have gotten a lot wrong.
p184
aVBecause the best way for people to change their lives
p185
aVis for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.
p186
aVSo I saw that and it was very humbling.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.
p189
aVI never once was asked for a donation,
p190
aVwhich had kind of been my mode, right.
p191
aVThere's poverty, you give money to help \u2014
p192
aVno one asked me for a donation.
p193
aVIn fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.
p194
aVIf anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already
p195
aVand to build on their own capabilities.
p196
aVSo what I did hear, once in a while,
p197
aVwas that people wanted a loan \u2014
p198
aVI thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.
p199
aVAnd by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,
p200
aVso I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.
p201
aVI just got this impression that the money would work.
p202
aVAnd my introduction to business
p203
aVwas in these $100 little infuses of capital.
p204
aVAnd I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,
p205
aVfrom farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.
p206
aVSo this idea
p207
aVthat these new stories of business and hope
p208
aVmight be shared with my friends and family,
p209
aVand through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed
p210
aVto be able to continue their businesses as loans,
p211
aVthat's this little idea that turned into Kiva.
p212
aa(lp213
VA few months later, I went back to Uganda
p214
aVwith a digital camera and a basic website
p215
aVthat my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,
p216
aVand took pictures of seven of my new friends,
p217
aVposted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,
p218
aVspammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.
p219
aVHaven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,
p220
aVbut do you say, do you want to help participate in this,
p221
aVprovide the money that they need?"
p222
aVThe money came in basically overnight.
p223
aVWe sent it over to Uganda.
p224
aVAnd over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;
p225
aVthe entrepreneurs received the money,
p226
aVthey were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,
p227
aVand they were able to support themselves
p228
aVand change the trajectory of their lives.
p229
aVIn October of '05,
p230
aVafter those first seven loans were paid,
p231
aVMatt and I took the word beta off of the site.
p232
aVWe said, "Our little experiment has been a success.
p233
aVLet's start for real." That was our official launch.
p234
aVAnd then that first year, October '05 through '06,
p235
aVKiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.
p236
aVThe second year, it was a total of 15 million.
p237
aVThe third year, the total was up to around 40.
p238
aVThe fourth year, we were just short of 100.
p239
aVAnd today, less than five years in,
p240
aVKiva's facilitated
p241
aVmore than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,
p242
aVfrom lenders and entrepreneurs \u2014
p243
aVmore than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.
p246
aVAnd while those numbers and those statistics
p247
aVare really fun to talk about and they're interesting,
p248
aVto me, Kiva's really about stories.
p249
aVIt's about retelling
p250
aVthe story of the poor,
p251
aVand it's about giving ourselves
p252
aVan opportunity to engage
p253
aVthat validates their dignity,
p254
aVvalidates a partnership relationship,
p255
aVnot a relationship that's based
p256
aVon the traditional sort of donor beneficiary
p257
aVweirdness that can happen.
p258
aVBut instead a relationship that can promote respect
p259
aVand hope
p260
aVand this optimism
p261
aVthat together we can move forward.
p262
aVSo what I hope is that,
p263
aVnot only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva \u2014
p264
aVthat's a very positive and meaningful thing \u2014
p265
aVbut I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,
p266
aVbetween the traditional rich and poor categories
p267
aVthat we're taught to see in the world,
p268
aVthis false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.
p269
aVI hope that Kiva can blur those lines.
p270
aVBecause as that happens,
p271
aVI think we can feel free to interact
p272
aVin a way that's more open, more just and more creative,
p273
aVto engage with each other and to help each other.
p274
aa(lp275
VImagine how you feel
p276
aVwhen you see somebody on street who is begging
p277
aVand you're about to approach them.
p278
aVImagine how you feel;
p279
aVand then imagine the difference when you might see somebody
p280
aVwho has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work
p281
aVwho wants to tell you about their business.
p282
aVMaybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.
p283
aVImagine if you're speaking with somebody
p284
aVwho's growing things and making them flourish,
p285
aVsomebody who's using their talents
p286
aVto do something productive,
p287
aVsomebody who's built their own business from scratch,
p288
aVsomeone who is surrounded by abundance,
p289
aVnot scarcity,
p290
aVwho's in fact creating abundance,
p291
aVsomebody with full hands with something to offer,
p292
aVnot empty hands
p293
aVasking for you to give them something.
p294
aVImagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect
p295
aVof somebody who wakes up every day
p296
aVand works very, very hard to make their life better.
p297
aVThese stories can really change the way that we think about each other.
p298
aVAnd if we can catalyze
p299
aVa supportive community to come around these individuals
p300
aVand to participate in their story
p301
aVby lending a little bit of money,
p302
aVI think that can change the way we believe in each other
p303
aVand each other's potential.
p304
aa(lp305
VNow for me, Kiva is just the beginning.
p306
aVAnd as I look forward to what is next,
p307
aVit's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.
p308
aVThe first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.
p309
aVKiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,
p310
aVhave taught me what entrepreneurship is.
p311
aVAnd I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.
p312
aVYou see an opportunity
p313
aVand you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.
p314
aVIn short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today
p315
aVand going after that.
p316
aVSecond thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.
p317
aVSo they're not a donation.
p318
aVYeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.
p319
aVBut in fact, when you give something to someone
p320
aVand they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go,
p321
aVthat's one thing.
p322
aVWhen you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,
p323
aVyou have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.
p324
aVThis continued attention \u2014 this ongoing attention \u2014
p325
aVis a really big deal
p326
aVto build different kinds of relationships among us.
p327
aVAnd then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,
p328
aVwhen all else is equal,
p329
aVgiven the option to have just money to do what you need to do,
p330
aVor money plus the support and encouragement
p331
aVof a global community,
p332
aVpeople choose the community plus the money.
p333
aVThat's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo with that in mind, this particular incident
p336
aVhas led to the things that I'm working on now.
p337
aVI see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.
p338
aVAnd one thing that I've seen
p339
aVis there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.
p340
aVWith social networks,
p341
aVit's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us
p342
aVin our own supportive communities, rapidly.
p343
aVAnd so, as I have been thinking about this,
p344
aVI've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities
p345
aVto catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas
p346
aVand to catalyze all of us
p347
aVto make tomorrow better than today?
p348
aVAs I've researched what's going on in the United States,
p349
aVa few interesting little insights have come up.
p350
aVSo one is that, of course, as we all might expect,
p351
aVmany small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world
p352
aVstill need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do
p353
aVor they might need money during a hard month.
p354
aVBut there's always a need for resources close by.
p355
aVAnother thing is, it turns out,
p356
aVthose resources don't usually come from the places you might expect \u2014
p357
aVbanks, venture capitalists,
p358
aVother organizations and support structures \u2014
p359
aVthey come from friends and family.
p360
aVSome statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses
p361
aVcomes from friends and family.
p362
aVThat's around 130 billion dollars a year \u2014
p363
aVit's a lot.
p364
aVAnd third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,
p365
aVit's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,
p366
aVhow to ask, what to promise in return,
p367
aVeven though they have the best of intentions
p368
aVand want to thank those people that are supporting them.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way
p371
aVand to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves
p372
aVexactly what that financial exchange should look like,
p373
aVexactly what fits them and the people around them,
p374
aVthis week actually,
p375
aVwe're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,
p376
aVwhich is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need
p377
aVthrough investments from their friends and family.
p378
aVAnd it's investments, not donations, not loans,
p379
aVbut investments that have a dynamic return.
p380
aVSo the mapping of participating in the story,
p381
aVit actually flows with the up and down.
p382
aVSo in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool
p383
aVfor small businesses to raise these funds.
p384
aVAnd what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,
p385
aVcreate investment terms in a really easy way.
p386
aVWe make it really, really simple for me
p387
aVas well as anyone else who wants to use the site.
p388
aVAnd we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.
p389
aVThey can raise up to a million dollars
p390
aVfrom an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors \u2014
p391
aVeveryday people, heaven forbid \u2014
p392
aVand they can share those returns over time \u2014
p393
aVagain, whatever terms they set.
p394
aVAs investors choose to become involved
p395
aVbased on those terms,
p396
aVthey can either take their rewards back as cash,
p397
aVor they can decide in advance
p398
aVto give those returns away to a non-profit.
p399
aVSo they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.
p400
aVIt's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea
p401
aVa path to go do what they want to do in the world
p402
aVand to gather the people around them that they already have,
p403
aVthe people that know them best
p404
aVand that love them and want to support them,
p405
aVto gather them to make this happen.
p406
aa(lp407
VSo that's what I'm working on now.
p408
aVAnd to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.
p409
aVRight now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,
p410
aVand it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.
p411
aVWhat we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,
p412
aVjust like they've cared enough to use Kiva
p413
aVto make those connections.
p414
aVBut the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care \u2014
p415
aVI'm not even going to try.
p416
aVI don't think, even though we often hear,
p417
aVyou know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,
p418
aVthe religious reasons,

p421
aVin fact, I think we know so much,
p422
aVand it's such a reality
p423
aVthat we care so deeply,
p424
aVthat in fact, what usually stops us

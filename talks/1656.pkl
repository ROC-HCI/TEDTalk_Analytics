VThis is about a hidden corner of the labor market.
p5
aVIt's the world of people who need to work ultra-flexibly,
p6
aVif they're to work at all.
p7
aVSo think, for instance,
p8
aVof someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition,
p9
aVor somebody who's caring for a dependent adult,
p10
aVor a parent with complex child care needs.
p11
aVTheir availability for work can be such that it's,
p12
aV"A few hours today.
p13
aVMaybe I can work tomorrow, but I don't know if and when yet."
p14
aVAnd it's extraordinarily difficult for these people
p15
aVto find the work that they so often need very badly.
p16
aVWhich is a tragedy because there are employers
p17
aVwho can use pools of very flexible local people
p18
aVbooked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work.
p19
aa(lp20
VImagine that you run a cafe.
p21
aVIt's mid-morning, the place is filling up.
p22
aVYou're going to have a busy lunchtime rush.
p23
aVIf you could get two extra workers for 90 minutes
p24
aVto start in an hour's time,
p25
aVyou'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works.
p26
aVThey'd have to be available at very competitive rates.
p27
aVThey'd have to be bookable in about the next minute.
p28
aVIn reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business,
p29
aVso you are going to muddle by, understaffed.
p30
aVAnd it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers,
p31
aVit's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses.
p32
aVThere's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people,
p33
aVpossibly already once they've been inducted.
p34
aa(lp35
VAt this level of the labor market,
p36
aVwhat you need is a marketplace for spare hours.
p37
aVThey do exist. Here's how they work.
p38
aVSo in this example, a distribution company has said,
p39
aVwe've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning.
p40
aVShow us everyone who's available.
p41
aVIt's found 31 workers.
p42
aVEverybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow.
p43
aVThey're all contactable in time for this booking.
p44
aVThey've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings.
p45
aVAnd this booking is within all the parameters for each individual.
p46
aVAnd they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking.
p47
aVOf course, they're all trained to work in warehouses.
p48
aVYou can select as many of them as you want.
p49
aVThey're from multiple agencies.
p50
aVIt's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking.
p51
aVAnd it's monitoring their reliability.
p52
aVThe people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones.
p53
aVThey're likely to be more expensive.
p54
aVIn an alternative view of this pool of local, very flexible people,
p55
aVhere's a market research company,
p56
aVand it's inducted maybe 25 local people in how to do street interviewing.
p57
aVAnd they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week.
p58
aVAnd they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted
p59
aVare available each hour next week.
p60
aVAnd they'll then decide when to do their street interviews.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut is there more that could be done
p63
aVfor this corner of the labor market?
p64
aVBecause right now there are so many people
p65
aVwho need whatever economic opportunity they can get.
p66
aVLet's make it personal.
p67
aVImagine that a young woman \u2014 base of the economic pyramid,
p68
aVvery little prospect of getting a job \u2014
p69
aVwhat economic activity could she theoretically engage in?
p70
aVWell, she might be willing to work odd hours
p71
aVin a call center, in a reception area, in a mail room.
p72
aVShe may be interested in providing local services to her community:
p73
aVbabysitting, local deliveries, pet care.
p74
aVShe may have possessions that she would like to trade
p75
aVat times she doesn't need them.
p76
aVSo she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out.
p77
aVShe might have a bike, a video games console she only uses occasionally.
p78
aVAnd you're probably thinking \u2014 because you're all very web-aware \u2014
p79
aVyes, and we're in the era of collaborative consumption,
p80
aVso she can go online and do all this.
p81
aVShe can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed,
p82
aVshe can go to TaskRabbit.com and say, "I want to do local deliveries," and so on.
p83
aa(lp84
VThese are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further.
p85
aVAnd the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all.
p86
aVMarkets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years,
p87
aVbut only for organizations at the top of the economy.
p88
aVIf you're a Wall Street trader, you now take it for granted
p89
aVthat you sell your financial assets in a system of markets
p90
aVthat identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time,
p91
aVexecutes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set.
p92
aVIt analyzes supply and demand and pricing
p93
aVand tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from.
p94
aVIt manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways.
p95
aVIt's all extremely low overhead.
p96
aVWhat have we gained at the bottom of the economy
p97
aVin terms of markets in the last 20 years?
p98
aVBasically classified adverts with a search facility.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo why do we have this disparity
p101
aVbetween these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy
p102
aVthat are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource
p103
aVout of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading,
p104
aVand what the rest of us have?
p105
aVA modern market is more than a website;
p106
aVit's a web of interoperable marketplaces,
p107
aVback office mechanisms, regulatory regimes,
p108
aVsettlement mechanisms, liquidity sources and so on.
p109
aVAnd when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning,
p110
aVshe does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today
p111
aVand then post that listing on multiple websites
p112
aVand wait for potential buyers to get in touch
p113
aVand start negotiating the terms on which she might trade.
p114
aa(lp115
VIn the early days of this modern markets technology,
p116
aVthe financial institutions worked out
p117
aVhow they could leverage their buying power, their back office processes,
p118
aVtheir relationships, their networks
p119
aVto shape these new markets that would create all this new activity.
p120
aVThey asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes,
p121
aVand in a lot of cases they got it.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut throughout the economy,
p124
aVthere are facilities that could likewise leverage
p125
aVa new generation of markets
p126
aVfor the benefit of all of us.
p127
aVAnd those facilities \u2014
p128
aVI'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity,
p129
aVthe licensing authorities
p130
aVthat know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time,
p131
aVthe processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels.
p132
aVThese mechanisms, these facilities
p133
aVare not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo,
p134
aVthey're controlled by the state.
p135
aVAnd the policymakers who sit on top of them
p136
aVare, I suggest, simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used
p137
aVto underpin a whole new era of markets.
p138
aa(lp139
VLike everyone else, those policymakers are taking it for granted
p140
aVthat modern markets are the preserve
p141
aVof organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves.
p142
aVSuppose we stopped taking that for granted.
p143
aVSuppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.,
p144
aVor the leader of any other developed nation,
p145
aVwoke up and said, "I'm never going to be able to create
p146
aVall the jobs I need in the current climate.
p147
aVI have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens.
p148
aVAnd for that they have to be able to access state-of-the-art markets.
p149
aVHow do I make that happen?"
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd I think I can see a few eyes rolling.
p152
aVPoliticians in a big, complex, sophisticated I.T. project?
p153
aVOh, that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen.
p154
aVNot necessarily.
p155
aVThere is a precedent for technology-enabled service
p156
aVthat has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries
p157
aVand has been hugely successful:
p158
aVnational lotteries.
p159
aa(lp160
VLet's take Britain as an example.
p161
aVOur government didn't design the national lottery,
p162
aVit didn't fund the national lottery, it doesn't operate the national lottery.
p163
aVIt simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed.
p164
aVThis act defines what a national lottery will look like.
p165
aVIt specifies certain benefits
p166
aVthat the state can uniquely bestow on the operators.
p167
aVAnd it puts some obligations on those operators.
p168
aVIn terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses,
p169
aVthis was an unqualified success.
p170
aa(lp171
VBut let's suppose that our aim
p172
aVis to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid.
p173
aVCould we use the same model?
p174
aVI believe we could.
p175
aVSo imagine that policymakers outlined a facility.
p176
aVLet's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.
p177
aVThink of it as a regulated public utility.
p178
aVSo it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.
p179
aVAnd it's a series of markets for low-level trade
p180
aVthat can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.
p181
aVAnd government has certain benefits
p182
aVit can uniquely bestow on these markets.
p183
aVIt's about public spending going through these markets
p184
aVto buy public services at the local level.
p185
aVIt's about interfacing these markets
p186
aVdirect into the highest official channels in the land.
p187
aVIt's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets.
p188
aVIt's about deregulating some sectors
p189
aVso that local people can enter them.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo, taxi journeys might be one example.
p192
aVAnd there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits
p193
aVto be placed on the operators,
p194
aVand the key one is, of course,
p195
aVthat the operators pay for everything,
p196
aVincluding all the interfacing into the public sector.
p197
aVSo imagine that the operators make their return
p198
aVby building a percentage markup into each transaction.
p199
aVImagine that there's a concession period
p200
aVdefined of maybe 15 years
p201
aVin which they can take all these benefits and run with them.
p202
aVAnd imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told,
p203
aVwhoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction
p204
aVto fund the whole thing
p205
aVwill get the deal.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo government then exits the frame.
p208
aVThis is now in the hands of the consortium.
p209
aVEither they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity
p210
aVand make a percentage on all of it
p211
aVor it's all going to crash and burn,
p212
aVwhich is tough on their shareholders.
p213
aVIt doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily.
p214
aVAnd there would be no constraints on alternative markets.
p215
aVSo this would just be one more choice
p216
aVamong millions of Internet forums.
p217
aVBut it could be very different,
p218
aVbecause having access to those state-backed facilities
p219
aVcould incentivize this consortium
p220
aVto seriously invest in the service.
p221
aVBecause they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going
p222
aVto start making their return.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo we're talking about sectors like home hair care,
p225
aVthe hire of toys, farm work,
p226
aVhire of clothes even, meals delivered to your door,
p227
aVservices for tourists, home care.
p228
aVThis would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed,
p229
aVbecause national e-markets will deliver data.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo this is a local person
p232
aVpotentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market.
p233
aVAnd they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training
p234
aVif they wanted to go into that market.
p235
aVThey'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents
p236
aVwho wanted a pool of babysitters.
p237
aVIs it worth their while?
p238
aVShould they be looking at other sectors?
p239
aVShould they be moving to another part of the country
p240
aVwhere there's a shortage of babysitters?
p241
aVThis kind of data can become routine.
p242
aVAnd this data can be used by investors.
p243
aVSo if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country
p244
aVand the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training,
p245
aVan investor can pay for it
p246
aVand the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals
p247
aVfor maybe the next two years.
p248
aa(lp249
VThis is a world of atomized capitalism.
p250
aVSo it's small trades by small people,
p251
aVbut it's very informed, safe, convenient, low-overhead and immediate.
p252
aVSome rough research suggests this could unlock
p253
aVaround 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity
p254
aVin a country the size of the U.K.
p255
aa(lp256
VDoes that sound improbable to you?
p257
aVThat's what a lot of people said about turbo trading
p258
aVin financial exchanges 20 years ago.
p259
aVDo not underestimate the transformative power
p260
aVof truly modern markets.
p261
aa(lp262
VThank you.

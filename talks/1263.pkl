VThe story I want to tell you about, started to me,
p5
aVin 1996 when I was studying in England.
p6
aVOne day, I was glancing through my bank statement (I didn't have much to look at)
p7
aVand I've noticed that in the upper corner there was a symbol, that I'm going to show you,
p8
aVsaying that document had been made in plain language, for me to understand it.
p9
aVThe idea interested me; I tried to find out what that was
p10
aVand I found out that there was a campaign for the simplification of language,
p11
aVwhich was the "Plain English Campaign".
p12
aVI thought it was a fabulous idea, for about  one day or two,
p13
aVand I've never thought about it since.
p14
aVWhen I came back to Portugal, for good,
p15
aVI came across with several documents - for example,  my work contract,
p16
aVthe papers I had to sign to buy a house,  the electricity bill \u2014
p17
aVa series of documents that reminded me of  that bank statement.
p18
aVNot because they were equally clear and simple,
p19
aVbut because they were the exact opposite.
p20
aVBecause I had to read everything twice or thrice,  to begin to understand what was written there.
p21
aVAnd then, that little seed that had been sown in 1996, started germinating.
p22
aVAnd one day, I found myself
p23
aVentering through my boss' office and quitting  my job to dedicate myself to this.
p24
aVAnd so, what did I find out, right off the start?
p25
aVI found out that it was a much more severe problem  than I thought.
p26
aVIt wasn't only about these documents being  complex and annoying,
p27
aVit was the fact that Portuguese people's literacy \u2014
p28
aVliteracy is the hability to understand written documents \u2014
p29
aVis extremely low. I'm going to show you a chart about Portuguese people's literacy [rate].
p30
aVYou know that about 10, 11% of people, in Portugal,
p31
aa(lp32
Vdon't know how to read nor write at all, yet.
p33
aVOver there are those who know, or say they know,  how to read and write. So, what do we have?
p34
aVWe have that group of red people in level 1,  which is the lowest in literacy [rate].
p35
aVThey are persons who are able to join letters,
p36
aVbut they can't, actually, understand.
p37
aVFor example, if a person, from that red group,  has to pick up
p38
aVthe package leaflet of a medicinal product,  to give a dose of medicine to his/her child,
p39
aVhe/she can't, can't understand the information.
p40
aV50% of the Portuguese. Then we have 30% more,  those yellow ones,
p41
aVover there, people who get by on the daily basis.
p42
aVThat is, if they don't have to read anything too new  or too different, they will manage.
p43
aVBut, for example, if they work in a factory and  a new machine arrives
p44
aVand they have to read the machine's manual  to be able to work with it, they can't do it anymore.
p45
aVAnd there they go, 80% of the Portuguese people.
p46
aVThen we have a few more that can handle documents,
p47
aVas long as they are not too complex,
p48
aVand we have 5% of the population that  can handle really complex documents.
p49
aVNow, just so you don't think this is normal,  that over there is Sweden.
p50
aVWhile we have 20% of people with the literacy  considered essential for a daily basis,
p51
aVSweden has 75%.
p52
aVAnd looking at that, what did I realize?
p53
aVI realized we live in an apartheid of information.
p54
aVI realized that there's a small minority of people  who has indeed access to information
p55
aVand can use it to their advantage and  a huge majority that can't.
p56
aVAnd because they can't, they are excluded  and they are impaired.
p57
aVLet me give you an example.
p58
aVThat one is Mr. Domingos, my building's doorkeeper. Mr. Domingos started to read at the age of 27,
p59
aVso, he falls in that yellow group that  we have seen a little while ago.
p60
aVFrom time to time, I'm arriving home and he says:
p61
aV"Miss Sandra!"; "Yes, Mr. Domingos."
p62
aV"Here is a little letter." So, the deal is: when Mr. Domingos or someone in the family or in the neighbourhood
p63
aVreceives something that they don't understand,  they come to me and I help them to translate it.
p64
aVAnd so, that time he said to me like this:
p65
aV"Oh, Miss Sandra, I'm about to throw this away,  but check it if this is important."
p66
aVIt was very important. He had been waiting,  for quite a while, to have a knee surgery
p67
aVand that was the letter of the famous surgery-bank checks. When a person is waiting for a long time,
p68
aVthey get a bank check and with that bank check  they can have that surgery in the private sector.
p69
aVIt was almost thrown away into the garbage,  Mr. Domingos' letter.
p70
aVIn that same year, I've found out,
p71
aVonly 20% of people had used these  surgery-bank checks.
p72
aVThe other 80%, I don't believe they had been cured while they were waiting.
p73
aVThey most likely did the same as Mr. Domingos:
p74
aV"Ah! What's this? I'm not understanding,  it's going to the garbage".
p75
aVThey lost the opportunity to have the surgery  they needed.
p76
aVWhat happens here? When people don't understand
p77
aVthis has severe consequences \u2014 to the individual,  but also for the country.
p78
aVWhen I don't understand which are my rights,  the benefits I can have access to,
p79
aVI can't understand my duties and I'm not  an active and participative citizen either.
p80
aVNow, maybe, you are sitting there and thinking:
p81
aV"Yeah, poor Mr. Domingos... Bad luck, isn't it?  Me?! I'm in the green ones."
p82
aV"I'm absolutely sure that I'm one of the green ones.  I was selected to come to TED! Hum?" (Laughter)
p83
aVSo the deal is: I have here some texts to read to you
p84
aVand I'm going to see what color are you  when I finish reading.
p85
aVSo, come on, this is an automobile insurance  contract. It says this:
p86
aV"Unless contrary stipulation, the decease of the ensured person, the ensured capital is provided,
p87
aVin case of predeceasing of the beneficiary relatively to the ensured person, to the heirs of the last,
p88
aVin case of the simultaneous decease of the ensured person and of the beneficiary,
p89
aVto the heirs of the last". Hum? (Laughter)
p90
aVNext, there's another one, from the medicines'  package leaflet, that says the following:
p91
aV"Warning! It may also occur erythema, edema,  vesiculation, keratolysis and urticaria."
p92
aVHum? Are you clear?
p93
aVAnd this one is really good. This one, I signed a renting contract to the new office on Friday
p94
aVand I laughed my head off.
p95
aVSo, it said: "I, as a cosigner, assume the opportune  payment of the rents,
p96
aVwaiving the benefits of the division  and prior foreclosure."
p97
aVWhen I heard "opportune payment" ["storm payment"  in Portuguese], I imagined myself bursting in there,
p98
aVslamming the door and saying: "Here's the money!!!" (Laughter)
p99
aVBut it's not! (Laughter) (Applause)
p100
aVBut it's not! (Applause)
p101
aV(Applause)
p102
aV(Applause)
p103
aVSo, it's this: when we leave our area of expertise \u2014
p104
aVand it only takes a little; there is no need to go  to the string theory or something like that,
p105
aVit only takes a little... (Laughter)
p106
aVWhat happens?
p107
aVWe get as lost as Mr. Domingos.
p108
aVAnd these documents are not written  by experts to experts,
p109
aVas the ones from the string theory.
p110
aVNo! These are documents written for me,  these are the public documents,
p111
aVthe public documents I need to understand  in my daily life,
p112
aVto govern myself, to live my life.
p113
aVThese are the renting contracts, the package leaflet  of the medicines.
p114
aVIt's all this. The electricity bills.
p115
aVThis has to be clear, so that I can understand.
p116
aVBecause, if I can't understand, what happens?
p117
aVI make mistakes, I get wrong.
p118
aVI'm going to give you an example of mistakes that  were committed, bad decisions made
p119
aVfor not being able to understand documents.
p120
aVDo you remember the subprime crisis that  took place in the United States?
p121
aVWhat happened?
p122
aVPeople signed those loans to buy houses,
p123
aVwithout truly understanding what they were signing.
p124
aVBecause if they knew what they were signing,
p125
aVthey'd know that as soon as the interest rate started to rise, the monthly payment would also increase,
p126
aVthey wouldn't be able to pay anymore and  they would end up without a house.
p127
aVSo, the rest, after that, next, everything  crumbled down and we know the rest.
p128
aVDo you think that if there was a culture of clarity  in the financial sector
p129
aVthings would have got up to where they've got?
p130
aVI don't think so. So,
p131
aVhow do you solve this problem,
p132
aVthis such big difference between the  literacy [rate] of the Portuguese,
p133
aVthat is down here, and the complexity  of the public documents,
p134
aVthose ones we need to understand in our daily lives, sorry,
p135
aVthat are up here?
p136
aVSo, the first think that comes to mind is,
p137
aV"If literacy is down here, let's make it rise" \u2014 isn't it?
p138
aVLet's educate people.
p139
aVLet's, let's... of course we will,  of course we will educate people.
p140
aVThe thing is, it's hard and it's slow.  And I don't even want to imagine
p141
aVhow many generations it will take until we are  at Sweden's level.
p142
aVBut, besides that, it's not only because it is slow.  There is another problem.
p143
aVIf the language of the documents  isn't simpler,
p144
aVwe've already seen that people, even with  a high literacy level, like you,
p145
aVif the language is hard, they don't get cleared,
p146
aVthey continue to be unable to understand these documents.
p147
aVSo, besides increasing literacy [rate], and for now,
p148
aVit's much more important to reduce  the complexity of documents
p149
aVand simplify the language.
p150
aVI'm going to show you an example.
p151
aVWhen I talk about simplifying the language.  Notice!
p152
aVOn the left side of a contract:
p153
aV"It is agreed that the insurance company, bla bla bla,  bla bla bla, bla bla..."
p154
aVThis is a before and after example. What do we mean with simplifying language?
p155
aVIt's communicating in a simple and clear way,  enabling our reader to understand it at first glance.
p156
aVWhat do you prefer? Before or after?
p157
aVThere isn't much doubt, is there?
p158
aVSo, how is this achieved? How can you make  the State and companies communicate
p159
aVwith citizens in a language they can understand  at first glance?
p160
aVThere are several ways. There are countries  that are going by the path of legislation.
p161
aVFor example, Sweden and the United States  introduced, last year, a legislation that forces
p162
aVthe State to communicate with people in  a language they can understand.
p163
aVAnd you think, "Well, that's normal.  They are countries that are a bit ahead.
p164
aV"Sweden, maybe, much more than the United States.
p165
aV"But they are countries that are a bit ahead.
p166
aV"It would be nice if in our country there was also  legislation towards that, wouldn't it be?"
p167
aVSo it would. And there is! Since 1999.
p168
aVThe Law of the Administrative Modernization  says that
p169
aVthe communication between the State and the people
p170
aVshould be simple, clear, concise, meaningful,  without acronyms, bla bla bla...
p171
aVBut the thing is: it is not applied. So, the question,
p172
aVthe path of going through legislation,  enforcing through legislation,
p173
aVworks in those countries where laws  are made to be applied.
p174
aVNow, there is another way, the way of marketing.
p175
aVHow does that work? It's like this:
p176
aVprivate companies change their language;  communicate in a clearer and simpler way,
p177
aVthey make a big fuss about it, consumers love it,
p178
aVthe sales rise, it works beautifully.
p179
aVBut it works for the private sector.
p180
aVNow, what is the third path, and to me,  the most important one?
p181
aVIt's the path of civil movements,
p182
aVthat are based in a mentality shift.
p183
aVIn countries where this really went forward \u2014
p184
aVdo you remember the English label, of the "Plain English Campaign"? \u2014
p185
aVthis is all based on a consumers' movement.
p186
aVSo, what does it take for that civic movement  to happen?
p187
aVWe need to understand two very important things:
p188
aVFirst, wanting to understand these  public documents is not a whim,
p189
aVis not an intellectual curiosity.
p190
aVIt is a necessity that I have in my daily life.
p191
aVAnd above all, it is a right, it is everyone's right.
p192
aVOn this side we have: understanding is a right.
p193
aVAnd we have to understand another thing too,
p194
aVwhich is: he who writes, has to write in order  to be understood.
p195
aVHow do we get there?
p196
aVFirst of all: we have to become demanding  consumers and citizens.
p197
aVThink it this way: next time someone  gives you a document
p198
aVthat you just simply don't understand, don't be shy,
p199
aVdon't keep quiet, pretending that you are  understanding everything.
p200
aVNo! Demand to understand. Ask.
p201
aVI know that this is not easy. Turn to the gentleman  in the little suite and say:
p202
aV"Look here, this contract, this part,  what does this mean?"
p203
aVIt's not easy, and perhaps it's even a bit  embarrassing, isn't it?
p204
aVBut it is not. It's a sign of intelligence.
p205
aVWhat do you teach your children when  they have doubts in school?
p206
aV"Don't say nothing to anyone, shut up really good  and act smart."
p207
aVNo, you don't, right? You say:
p208
aV"Look, when you don't understand, you put your hand  up in the air and ask the teacher until you are cleared."
p209
aVAnd that is exactly what we have to do,  as consumers and citizens.
p210
aVSo, next time you come across with  a document you don't understand,
p211
aVdemand to understand, put aside your pride and ask
p212
aVuntil you get completely cleared.
p213
aVThen, there's the other side, which is: "Okay, these awful documents
p214
aV"which are in circulation, they don't grow on trees.
p215
aV"Someone wrote them." Hum?
p216
aVMaybe, among this big group, some persons...
p217
aVI don't know, some lawyers, some public employees \u2014 I'm not asking you to identify yourselves,
p218
aVbut I ask you to search your own conscience.
p219
aVHow many times do you write documents  for the general public,
p220
aVfor people that don't share your language,
p221
aVand you write them in a language that  only you will understand?
p222
aVAnd you'll say: "Ah, that's because  there is a reason, here!"
p223
aVDear friends, I already heard all the reasons.
p224
aVThere are thousands of reasons. They go like these:
p225
aV"Ah, it's the house's culture"; "Oh, my boss!"
p226
aV"Oh, the judge! And what if this goes to court?"
p227
aV"What you want is to destroy language.  We have to educate people."
p228
aV"We can't lower the level"; bla, bla, bla...
p229
aVI've seen all of this. These are excuses.
p230
aVA while ago, they told us about Einstein.
p231
aVEinstein said this: "If you can't write about a subject,
p232
aVin a simple way, it's because, in fact,  you don't understand it."
p233
aVSo, if you... (Applause)
p234
aVTo Einstein... (Applause)
p235
aVTo Einstein...(Applause)
p236
aVSo \u2014 ah, ah, I don't have time! \u2014
p237
aVso, if you do know what you want to say \u2014  don't you? \u2014
p238
aVyou are aware of what you want to say,
p239
aVyou just have to do one thing: believe that it is  possible to write in a simple way.
p240
aVAnd how do you do that?
p241
aVIt's very easy. You write to your grandmother.  Hum?
p242
aVYou write to your grandmother. I'm going  to show grandma to you.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aVYou write with respect and without paternalism.
p245
aVAnd you use three techniques that I'm going  to teach you. First of all:
p246
aVStart by the most important.
p247
aVGrandma has a lot to do. She is not going to read three pages to get to the main idea.
p248
aVStart by the most important.
p249
aVNext, use short sentences, because grandma,
p250
aVlike anyone of us,
p251
aVif you make very long sentences,
p252
aVshe gets to the end and she can't remember what  you said in the beginning, anymore.
p253
aVAnd lastly, the third, use plain words, those ones  that grandma knows.
p254
aVAlright? It's easy!
p255
aVBefore I leave,
p256
aVI would like to talk to you about "Clara" (Clear).  "Clara" is a project of social responsibility.
p257
aVIt has this mission: to change the way how public communication is made.
p258
aVWhat do we do?
p259
aVWe are going to launch this year  a collection of "Claro" guides,
p260
aVthat is, we are going to pick very, very,  very complex subjects and put them simple.
p261
aVWe are going to start with the  "Claro" Guide of Justice.
p262
aVI think it is an area... that comes in handy.  (Applause)
p263
aVAnd now I'm going to follow Manuel [Forjaz]'s advise.  If it's time to ask,
p264
aVwhoever wants to sponsor the  "Claro" Guide of Justice \u2014 I don't know...
p265
aVfor example, the EDP Foundation, or...ha? \u2014
p266
aVcome talk to me later.
p267
aVAnother thing we will do is to grant prizes  to the worse and best documents,
p268
aVbecause, indeed, there are people who are working to communicate in a clearer way,
p269
aVand that have to be rewarded,
p270
aVand there are lazy people that do nothing  about it and need to be humiliated.
p271
aVSo, we'll give prizes to the worst and to the best.
p272
aVI'm counting on your help. (Applause)
p273
aV(Applause)
p274
aVWe are going to launch... we are going to launch the campaign via Clara's Facebook,
p275
aVso, send your friendship request and  you'll be up to date.
p276
aVBut, lastly, above all, what does "Clara" want?
p277
aVIt wants to put two little things in your heads.
p278
aVThe first one: demand to understand. Don't be shy.
p279
aVAnd write in order to be understood.  Write to your grandma.
p280
aVAnd if you don't have a grandmother, write to  Mr. Domingos, he will like it.
p281
aVThank you. (Applause)

VThis talk is about righting writing wrongs.
p5
aVNo, the sound's not faulty \u2014 righting writing wrongs.
p6
aVThe Middle East is huge,
p7
aVand with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh.
p8
aVI think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.
p9
aVWe need to take our responsibilities seriously,
p10
aVbut not ourselves.
p11
aVDon't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.
p12
aVI grew up at a time when iconic actors
p13
aVfrom Kuwait, Syria, Egypt
p14
aVused laughter to unite the region,
p15
aVjust as football can.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVNow is the time for us to laugh at ourselves,
p18
aVbefore others can laugh with us.
p19
aVThis is the story of the rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the Middle East \u2014
p20
aVa stand-up uprising, if you will.
p21
aa(lp22
VWorking in London as TV maker and writer,
p23
aVI quickly realized
p24
aVthat comedy connects audiences.
p25
aVNow, the best breeding ground for good comic writing
p26
aVis the stand-up comedy circuit,
p27
aVwhere they just happen to say that you kill when you do well
p28
aVand you bomb when you do badly.
p29
aVAn unfortunate connection for us maybe,
p30
aVbut it reminds me
p31
aVthat we'd like to thank one man for, over the past decade,
p32
aVworking tirelessly
p33
aVto support comedians all around the world,
p34
aVspecifically comedians
p35
aVwith a Middle Eastern background.
p36
aV(Applause)
p37
aVLike my good friends, Dean and Maysoon, at the bottom of the screen,
p38
aVwho, two years after 9/11,
p39
aVstarted a festival to change the way
p40
aVMiddle Easterners are perceived in the world.
p41
aVIt's still going strong, with positive press to die for.
p42
aVAlso, three guys working for years in Los Angeles,
p43
aVan Iranian, a Palestinian and an Egyptian,
p44
aVcreated the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act.
p45
aVAnd wherever they went,
p46
aVthey killed.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, I didn't start this fire, but I did pour petrol on it.
p49
aVI moved to Dubai as the head of original content
p50
aVfor a Western TV network.
p51
aVMy job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience.
p52
aVNow, the American head of programming
p53
aVwanted new local Arabic comedy.
p54
aVIn a thick Arabic accent, my brain went,
p55
aV"Berfect."
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVNow, I had friends in the U.S.
p58
aVwho had started a successful new tribe.
p59
aVAnd I had every intention of taking this tribe
p60
aVfrom being outliers in the Middle East
p61
aVand pushing them over the tipping point
p62
aVtowards success.
p63
aVNow, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.
p64
aVI had four phases to this plan.
p65
aVFirst, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it.
p66
aVThen I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done.
p67
aVWe would film that and air it,
p68
aVand then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy.
p69
aa(lp70
VI excitedly presented this to the big boss,
p71
aVand his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it."
p72
aVSo I retreated back to my cave
p73
aVand continued to support and produce comedy
p74
aVand let my friends use my couch
p75
aVas a regional operations hub.
p76
aVNow, fast forward two years, to early 2007.
p77
aVThe earth rotated, as did our management,
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVand as if by divine intervention,
p80
aVthings came together
p81
aVto help this revolution take shape.
p82
aVHere's how the dots connected.
p83
aVFirst, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special
p84
aVthat aired in the States,
p85
aVand it was getting great hits on YouTube.
p86
aVOur new French CEO
p87
aVbelieved in the power of positive PR ...
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVand ideas du bon marche.
p90
aVLet's just say "value for money."
p91
aVI produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed
p92
aVto showcase his new Axis special to a packed room.
p93
aVI invited our new CEO,
p94
aVand as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels,
p95
aVhis reaction was very simple:
p96
aV"Let's make this happen.
p97
aVAnd one more thing: No, don't F it up."
p98
aVSo I quickly went to work
p99
aVwith a great team around me.
p100
aVI happened to find
p101
aVa funny guy to present it in Arabic,
p102
aVwho is originally Korean,
p103
aVa perfect fit for the Axis of Evil.
p104
aVThis is all true.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow, while preparing for the tour,
p107
aVI had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive.
p108
aVI used the three Bs of stand-up don'ts
p109
aVas I call them in the Middle East:
p110
aVblue content, keep it clean; beliefs, not religion;
p111
aVand the third B, bolitics.
p112
aVStay away from bolitics in the Middle East.
p113
aVOh course, you might think, what's left
p114
aVwithout bolitics, sex and religion, how can you make people laugh?
p115
aVI'd say, watch any successful well-written,
p116
aVfamily-friendly sitcom in the West
p117
aVfor your answers.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, were the Axis successful?
p120
aVIn five countries, in just under a month,
p121
aVwe had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.
p122
aVWe had millions see them on TV and on TV news.
p123
aVIn Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them.
p124
aVIn fact, they were so successful
p125
aVthat you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD,
p126
aVeven before it was released in the Middle East.
p127
aVAnywhere you go.
p128
aVSo everywhere we went,
p129
aVwe auditioned amateurs.
p130
aVWe filmed that process and aired a documentary.
p131
aVI called it "Three Guys and Wonho."
p132
aVIt really is his name.
p133
aVAnd all this TV and Internet exposure
p134
aVhas led to a great many
p135
aVrecruits to our cause.
p136
aVIn Dubai this year, we've just had
p137
aVthe first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show.
p138
aVAnd notice two of them are wearing headscarves,
p139
aVand yes, even they can laugh.
p140
aa(lp141
VDubai, to me, is like a hand
p142
aVthat supports anyone who wants to make things happen.
p143
aV20 years ago,
p144
aVno one had heard of it.
p145
aVLook at it now.
p146
aVWith an inspirational leader, I think this year,
p147
aVthe opening of the tallest tower in the world
p148
aVis like adding a finger to that hand,
p149
aVthat points at all those
p150
aVwho spread fallacious stories about us.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
V(Applause)
p155
aa(lp156
VNow, in three short years, we've come a long way
p157
aVwith stand-up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia.
p158
aVThese comics are now going to the New York festival.
p159
aVAnd the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese,
p160
aVNemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour,
p161
aVhas just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs.
p162
aVSo clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image,
p163
aVand it's exploding.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVSo, as for the outsiders looking in,
p166
aVwatch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival.
p167
aVThe reporter did a great job, and I thank her,
p168
aVbut somebody forgot to send the positive PR email
p169
aVto the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom.
p170
aVFor example, when Dean talks,
p171
aVthe ticker says, "U.S.: Suspect gave 'actionable intel."
p172
aVWell, if you're used to listening to comedians,
p173
aVthen I'm not surprised.
p174
aa(lp175
VSadly, this leads me to another three Bs
p176
aVthat represents how the media in the West
p177
aVtalks about us as bombers, billionaires
p178
aVand belly dancers.
p179
aVEnough.
p180
aVWe're not all angry fanatics
p181
aVwho want to kill the infidel.
p182
aVWe have a positive story to tell
p183
aVand image to sell.
p184
aVIn fact, one thing's for sure, in my experience,
p185
aVwe love to laugh like hell.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VHere are three questions that I like to use
p190
aVto test the truthiness of our representation
p191
aVin any media story.
p192
aVOne: Is the Middle East
p193
aVbeing shown in a current time
p194
aVand correct context?
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVTwo: Do the Middle Eastern characters
p197
aVlaugh or smile
p198
aVwithout showing the whites of their eyes?
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aVThree: Is the Middle Eastern character
p201
aVbeing played by one?
p202
aVClearly, there are wrongs that need to be righted.
p203
aVWe've started in our region.
p204
aVMy challenge to the rest of the world
p205
aVis please, start using
p206
aVpositive Middle Eastern images in your stories.
p207
aVFor inspiration, go to one of our festivals,
p208
aVgo online, drop us a line.
p209
aVLet's change the narrative together
p210
aVand let's start righting writing wrongs.
p211
aa(lp212
VI'd like to end, before going back to the Middle East,
p213
aVwith a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs
p214
aVto put quill to parchment.
p215
aVAs my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;"
p216
aVas my mother would say, "Shakespeare."
p217
aV(Laughter)
p218
aV"And now we go in content
p219
aVto liberty and not to banishment."
p220
aa(lp221
VThank you.

And this led to a ground- and record-breaking tour of five Arab countries: The Axis of Evil Middle East Comedy Tour. Lines around the block, performances for royalty -- the tour tapped into a shared desire to laugh. </p><p>Standup comedians on the tour avoid the three B&#39;s (blue material, beliefs and &quot;bolitics&quot;) but are free to poke fun everywhere else. One of Abu-Wardeh&#39;s stars, proteg&eacute; Wonho Chung, is a Korean kid who speaks perfect Arabic and is wildly popular on YouTube in Saudi Arabia -- proving to Abu-Wardeh that lines between national groups can be broken down if you&#39;re just funny enough.

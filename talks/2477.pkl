VI want to introduce you to an amazing woman.
p5
aVHer name is Davinia.
p6
aVDavinia was born in Jamaica, emigrated to the US at the age of 18,
p7
aVand now lives just outside of Washington, DC.
p8
aVShe's not a high-powered political staffer,
p9
aVnor a lobbyist.
p10
aVShe'd probably tell you she's quite unremarkable,
p11
aVbut she's having the most remarkable impact.
p12
aVWhat's incredible about Davinia
p13
aVis that she's willing to spend time every single week
p14
aVfocused on people who are not her:
p15
aVpeople not her in her neighborhood, her state, nor even in her country \u2014
p16
aVpeople she'd likely never meet.
p17
aa(lp18
VDavinia's impact started a few years ago
p19
aVwhen she reached out to all of her friends on Facebook,
p20
aVand asked them to donate their pennies
p21
aVso she could fund girls' education.
p22
aVShe wasn't expecting a huge response,
p23
aVbut 700,000 pennies later,
p24
aVshe's now sent over 120 girls to school.
p25
aVWhen we spoke last week,
p26
aVshe told me she's become a little infamous at the local bank
p27
aVevery time she rocks up with a shopping cart full of pennies.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow \u2014 Davinia is not alone.
p30
aVFar from it.
p31
aVShe's part of a growing movement.
p32
aVAnd there's a name for people like Davinia:
p33
aVglobal citizens.
p34
aVA global citizen is someone who self-identifies first and foremost
p35
aVnot as a member of a state, a tribe or a nation,
p36
aVbut as a member of the human race,
p37
aVand someone who is prepared to act on that belief,
p38
aVto tackle our world's greatest challenges.
p39
aVOur work is focused on finding,
p40
aVsupporting and activating global citizens.
p41
aVThey exist in every country
p42
aVand among every demographic.
p43
aa(lp44
VI want to make the case to you today
p45
aVthat the world's future depends on global citizens.
p46
aVI'm convinced that if we had more global citizens active in our world,
p47
aVthen every single one of the major challenges we face \u2014
p48
aVfrom poverty, climate change, gender inequality \u2014
p49
aVthese issues become solvable.
p50
aVThey are ultimately global issues,
p51
aVand they can ultimately only be solved
p52
aVby global citizens demanding global solutions from their leaders.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, some people's immediate reaction to this idea
p55
aVis that it's either a bit utopian or even threatening.
p56
aVSo I'd like to share with you a little of my story today,
p57
aVhow I ended up here,
p58
aVhow it connects with Davinia
p59
aVand, hopefully, with you.
p60
aa(lp61
VGrowing up in Melbourne, Australia,
p62
aVI was one of those seriously irritating little kids
p63
aVthat never, ever stopped asking, "Why?"
p64
aVYou might have been one yourself.
p65
aVI used to ask my mum the most annoying questions.
p66
aVI'd ask her questions like, "Mum, why I can't I dress up
p67
aVand play with puppets all day?"
p68
aV"Why do you want fries with that?"
p69
aV"What is a shrimp,
p70
aVand why do we have to keep throwing them on the barbie?"
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
V"And mum \u2014 this haircut.
p75
aVWhy?"
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VThe worst haircut, I think.
p80
aVStill terrible.
p81
aa(lp82
VAs a "why" kid, I thought I could change the world,
p83
aVand it was impossible to convince me otherwise.
p84
aVAnd when I was 12 and in my first year of high school,
p85
aVI started raising money for communities in the developing world.
p86
aVWe were a really enthusiastic group of kids,
p87
aVand we raised more money than any other school in Australia.
p88
aVAnd so I was awarded the chance to go to the Philippines to learn more.
p89
aVIt was 1998.
p90
aVWe were taken into a slum in the outskirts of Manila.
p91
aVIt was there I became friends with Sonny Boy,
p92
aVwho lived on what was literally a pile of steaming garbage.
p93
aV"Smoky Mountain" was what they called it.
p94
aVBut don't let the romance of that name fool you,
p95
aVbecause it was nothing more than a rancid landfill
p96
aVthat kids like Sonny Boy spent hours rummaging through every single day
p97
aVto find something, anything of value.
p98
aa(lp99
VThat night with Sonny Boy and his family changed my life forever,
p100
aVbecause when it came time to go to sleep,
p101
aVwe simply laid down on this concrete slab the size of half my bedroom
p102
aVwith myself, Sonny Boy, and the rest of his family,
p103
aVseven of us in this long line,
p104
aVwith the smell of rubbish all around us
p105
aVand cockroaches crawling all around.
p106
aVAnd I didn't sleep a wink,
p107
aVbut I lay awake thinking to myself,
p108
aV"Why should anyone have to live like this
p109
aVwhen I have so much?
p110
aVWhy should Sonny Boy's ability to live out his dreams
p111
aVbe determined by where he's born,
p112
aVor what Warren Buffett called 'the ovarian lottery?'"
p113
aVI just didn't get it,
p114
aVand I needed to understand why.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, I only later came to understand
p117
aVthat the poverty I'd seen in the Philippines
p118
aVwas the result of decisions made or not made, man-made,
p119
aVby a succession of colonial powers and corrupt governments
p120
aVwho had anything but the interests of Sonny Boy at heart.
p121
aVSure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain, but they may as well have.
p122
aVAnd if we're to try to help kids like Sonny Boy,
p123
aVit wouldn't work just to try to send him a few dollars
p124
aVor to try to clean up the garbage dump on which he lived,
p125
aVbecause the core of the problem lay elsewhere.
p126
aVAnd as I worked on community development projects over the coming years
p127
aVtrying to help build schools,
p128
aVtrain teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS,
p129
aVI came to see that community development
p130
aVshould be driven by communities themselves,
p131
aVand that although charity is necessary, it's not sufficient.
p132
aVWe need to confront these challenges
p133
aVon a global scale and in a systemic way.
p134
aVAnd the best thing I could do
p135
aVis try to mobilize a large group of citizens back home
p136
aVto insist that our leaders engage in that systemic change.
p137
aa(lp138
VThat's why, a few years later,
p139
aVI joined with a group of college friends
p140
aVin bringing the Make Poverty History campaign to Australia.
p141
aVWe had this dream of staging this small concert
p142
aVaround the time of the G20 with local Aussie artists,
p143
aVand it suddenly exploded one day
p144
aVwhen we got a phone call from Bono, the Edge and Pearl Jam,
p145
aVwho all agreed to headline our concert.
p146
aVI got a little bit excited that day, as you can see.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VBut to our amazement,
p151
aVthe Australian government heard our collective voices,
p152
aVand they agreed to double investment into global health and development \u2014
p153
aVan additional 6.2 billion dollars.
p154
aVIt felt like \u2014
p155
aa(lp156
V(Applause)
p157
aa(lp158
VIt felt like this incredible validation.
p159
aVBy rallying citizens together, we helped persuade our government
p160
aVto do the unthinkable,
p161
aVand act to fix a problem miles outside of our borders.
p162
aa(lp163
VBut here's the thing:
p164
aVit didn't last.
p165
aVSee, there was a change in government,
p166
aVand six years later, all that new money
p167
aVdisappeared.
p168
aVWhat did we learn?
p169
aVWe learned that one-off spikes are not enough.
p170
aVWe needed a sustainable movement,
p171
aVnot one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician
p172
aVor the hint of an economic downturn.
p173
aVAnd it needed to happen everywhere;
p174
aVotherwise, every individual government would have this built-in excuse mechanism
p175
aVthat they couldn't possibly carry the burden of global action alone.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd so this is what we embarked upon.
p178
aVAnd as we embarked upon this challenge, we asked ourselves,
p179
aVhow do we gain enough pressure and build a broad enough army
p180
aVto win these fights for the long term?
p181
aVWe could only think of one way.
p182
aVWe needed to somehow turn that short-term excitement
p183
aVof people involved with the Make Poverty History campaign
p184
aVinto long-term passion.
p185
aVIt had to be part of their identity.
p186
aVSo in 2012, we cofounded an organization that had exactly that as its goal.
p187
aVAnd there was only one name for it:
p188
aVGlobal Citizen.
p189
aa(lp190
VBut this is not about any one organization.
p191
aVThis is about citizens taking action.
p192
aVAnd research data tells us
p193
aVthat of the total population who even care about global issues,
p194
aVonly 18 percent have done anything about it.
p195
aVIt's not that people don't want to act.
p196
aVIt's often that they don't know how to take action,
p197
aVor that they believe that their actions will have no effect.
p198
aVSo we had to somehow recruit and activate millions of citizens
p199
aVin dozens of countries
p200
aVto put pressure on their leaders to behave altruistically.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd as we did so, we discovered something really thrilling,
p203
aVthat when you make global citizenship your mission,
p204
aVyou suddenly find yourself with some extraordinary allies.
p205
aVSee, extreme poverty isn't the only issue that's fundamentally global.
p206
aVSo, too, is climate change,
p207
aVhuman rights, gender equality,
p208
aVeven conflict.
p209
aVWe found ourselves shoulder to shoulder
p210
aVwith people who are passionate about targeting all these interrelated issues.
p211
aa(lp212
VBut how did we actually go about recruiting
p213
aVand engaging those global citizens?
p214
aVWell, we used the universal language:
p215
aVmusic.
p216
aVWe launched the Global Citizen Festival
p217
aVin the heart of New York City in Central Park,
p218
aVand we persuaded some of the world's biggest artists to participate.
p219
aVWe made sure that these festivals coincided
p220
aVwith the UN General Assembly meeting,
p221
aVso that leaders who need to hear our voices
p222
aVcouldn't possible ignore them.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut there was a twist:
p225
aVyou couldn't buy a ticket.
p226
aVYou had to earn it.
p227
aVYou had to take action on behalf of a global cause,
p228
aVand only once you'd done that could you earn enough points to qualify.
p229
aVActivism is the currency.
p230
aVI had no interest in citizenship purely as some sort of feel-good thing.
p231
aVFor me, citizenship means you have to act, and that's what we required.
p232
aVAnd amazingly, it worked.
p233
aVLast year, more than 155,000 citizens in the New York area alone
p234
aVearned enough points to qualify.
p235
aVGlobally, we've now signed up citizens in over 150 countries around the world.
p236
aVAnd last year, we signed up more than 100,000 new members
p237
aVeach and every week of the whole year.
p238
aa(lp239
VSee, we don't need to create global citizens from nothing.
p240
aVWe're already everywhere.
p241
aVWe just need to be organized
p242
aVand motivated to start acting.
p243
aVAnd this is where I believe we can learn a lot from Davinia,
p244
aVwho started taking action as a global citizen back in 2012.
p245
aVHere's what she did.
p246
aVIt wasn't rocket science.
p247
aVShe started writing letters,
p248
aVemailing politicians' offices.
p249
aVShe volunteered her time in her local community.
p250
aVThat's when she got active on social media
p251
aVand started to collect pennies \u2014
p252
aVa lot of pennies.
p253
aa(lp254
VNow, maybe that doesn't sound like a lot to you.
p255
aVHow will that achieve anything?
p256
aVWell, it achieved a lot because she wasn't alone.
p257
aVHer actions, alongside 142,000 other global citizens',
p258
aVled the US government to double their investment
p259
aVinto Global Partnership for Education.
p260
aVAnd here's Dr. Raj Shah,
p261
aVthe head of USAID, making that announcement.
p262
aVSee, when thousands of global citizens find inspiration from each other,
p263
aVit's amazing to see their collective power.
p264
aVGlobal citizens like Davinia helped persuade the World Bank
p265
aVto boost their investment into water and sanitation.
p266
aVHere's the Bank's president Jim Kim announcing 15 billion dollars onstage
p267
aVat Global Citizen,
p268
aVand Prime Minister Modi of India affirmed his commitment
p269
aVto put a toilet in every household and school across India by 2019.
p270
aVGlobal citizens encouraged by the late-night host Stephen Colbert
p271
aVlaunched a Twitter invasion on Norway.
p272
aVErna Solberg, the country's Prime Minister, got the message,
p273
aVcommitting to double investment into girls' education.
p274
aVGlobal citizens together with Rotarians called on the Canadian, UK,
p275
aVand Australian governments
p276
aVto boost their investment into polio eradication.
p277
aVThey got together and committed 665 million dollars.
p278
aa(lp279
VBut despite all of this momentum,
p280
aVwe face some huge challenges.
p281
aVSee, you might be thinking to yourself,
p282
aVhow can we possibly persuade world leaders
p283
aVto sustain a focus on global issues?
p284
aVIndeed, the powerful American politician Tip O'Neill once said,
p285
aV"All politics is local."
p286
aVThat's what always got politicians elected:
p287
aVto seek, gain and hold onto power
p288
aVthrough the pursuit of local or at very best national interests.
p289
aa(lp290
VI experienced this for the first time when I was 21 years old.
p291
aVI took a meeting
p292
aVwith a then-Australian Foreign Minister who shall remain nameless \u2014
p293
aa(lp294
V[Alexander Downer]
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd behind closed doors,
p299
aVI shared with him my passion to end extreme poverty.
p300
aVI said, "Minister \u2014 Australia has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
p301
aVto help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
p302
aVWe can do this."
p303
aVAnd he paused,
p304
aVlooked down on me with cold, dismissive eyes,
p305
aVand he said, "Hugh,
p306
aVno one gives a funk about foreign aid."
p307
aVExcept he didn't use the word "funk."
p308
aVHe went on.
p309
aVHe said we need to look after our own backyard first.
p310
aa(lp311
VThis is, I believe,
p312
aVoutdated, even dangerous thinking.
p313
aVOr as my late grandfather would say,
p314
aVcomplete BS.
p315
aVParochialism offers this false dichotomy
p316
aVbecause it pits the poor in one country against the poor in another.
p317
aVIt pretends we can isolate ourselves and our nations from one another.
p318
aVThe whole world is our backyard,
p319
aVand we ignore it at our peril.
p320
aVSee, look what happened when we ignored Rwanda,
p321
aVwhen we ignore Syria,
p322
aVwhen we ignore climate change.
p323
aVPolitical leaders ought to give a "funk"
p324
aVbecause the impact of climate change and extreme poverty
p325
aVcomes right to our shore.
p326
aa(lp327
VNow, global citizens \u2014 they understand this.
p328
aVWe live in a time that favors the global citizen,
p329
aVin an age where every single voice can be heard.
p330
aVSee, do you remember
p331
aVwhen the Millennium Development Goals were signed back in the year 2000?
p332
aVThe most we could do in those days was fire off a letter
p333
aVand wait for the next election.
p334
aVThere was no social media.
p335
aVToday, billions of citizens have more tools,
p336
aVmore access to information,
p337
aVmore capacity to influence than ever before.
p338
aVBoth the problems and the tools to solve them are right before us.
p339
aVThe world has changed,
p340
aVand those of us who look beyond our borders
p341
aVare on the right side of history.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo where are we?
p344
aVSo we run this amazing festival,
p345
aVwe've scored some big policy wins,
p346
aVand citizens are signing up all over the world.
p347
aVBut have we achieved our mission?
p348
aVNo.
p349
aVWe have such a long way to go.
p350
aa(lp351
VBut this is the opportunity that I see.
p352
aVThe concept of global citizenship,
p353
aVself-evident in its logic but until now impractical in many ways,
p354
aVhas coincided with this particular moment in which we are privileged to live.
p355
aVWe, as global citizens,
p356
aVnow have a unique opportunity to accelerate large-scale positive change
p357
aVaround the world.
p358
aVSo in the months and years ahead,
p359
aVglobal citizens will hold world leaders accountable
p360
aVto ensure that the new Global Goals for Sustainable Development
p361
aVare tracked and implemented.
p362
aVGlobal citizens will partner with the world's leading NGOs
p363
aVto end diseases like polio and malaria.
p364
aVGlobal citizens will sign up in every corner of this globe,
p365
aVincreasing the frequency, quality
p366
aVand impact of their actions.
p367
aVThese dreams are within reach.
p368
aVImagine an army of millions
p369
aVgrowing into tens of millions,
p370
aVconnected, informed, engaged
p371
aVand unwilling to take no for an answer.
p372
aa(lp373
VOver all these years,
p374
aVI've tried to reconnect with Sonny Boy.
p375
aVSadly, I've been unable to.
p376
aVWe met long before social media,
p377
aVand his address has now been relocated by the authorities,
p378
aVas often happens with slums.
p379
aVI'd love to sit down with him,
p380
aVwherever he is,
p381
aVand share with him how much the time I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me.
p382
aVThanks to him and so many others,
p383
aVI came to understand the importance of being part of a movement of people \u2014
p384
aVthe kids willing to look up from their screens and out to the world,
p385
aVthe global citizens.
p386
aVGlobal citizens who stand together,
p387
aVwho ask the question "Why?,"
p388
aVwho reject the naysayers,
p389
aVand embrace the amazing possibilities of the world we share.
p390
aa(lp391
VI'm a global citizen.
p392
aa(lp393
VAre you?
p394
aa(lp395
VThank you.

VAs a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories
p5
aVabout the future,
p6
aVand where we might move forward from this point.
p7
aVSome of those stories are that
p8
aVsomebody is just going to sort everything out for us.
p9
aVOther stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut I want to tell you a different story here today.
p12
aVLike all stories, it has a beginning.
p13
aVMy work, for a long time, has been involved in education,
p14
aVin teaching people practical skills
p15
aVfor sustainability,
p16
aVteaching people how to take responsibility
p17
aVfor growing some of their own food,
p18
aVhow to build buildings using local materials,
p19
aVhow to generate their own energy, and so on.
p20
aa(lp21
VI lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland,
p22
aVand some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.
p23
aVBut all my work for many years was focused
p24
aVaround the idea that sustainability
p25
aVmeans basically looking at
p26
aVthe globalized economic growth model,
p27
aVand moderating what comes in at one end,
p28
aVand moderating the outputs at the other end.
p29
aVAnd then I came into contact with a way of looking at things
p30
aVwhich actually changed that profoundly.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd in order to introduce you to that,
p33
aVI've got something here that I'm going to unveil,
p34
aVwhich is one of the great marvels of the modern age.
p35
aVAnd it's something so astounding and so astonishing
p36
aVthat I think maybe as I remove this cloth
p37
aVa suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.
p38
aVIf you could help me with that it would be fantastic.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVThis is a liter of oil.
p41
aa(lp42
VThis bottle of oil,
p43
aVdistilled over a hundred million years of geological time,
p44
aVancient sunlight,
p45
aVcontains the energy equivalent of about five weeks
p46
aVhard human manual labor \u2014
p47
aVequivalent to about 35 strong people
p48
aVcoming round and working for you.
p49
aVWe can turn it into a dazzling array of materials,
p50
aVmedicine, modern clothing,
p51
aVlaptops, a whole range of different things.
p52
aVIt gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.
p53
aVWe've based the design of our settlements,
p54
aVour business models, our transport plans,
p55
aVeven the idea of economic growth, some would argue,
p56
aVon the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.
p57
aa(lp58
VYet, when we take a step back,
p59
aVand look over the span of history,
p60
aVat what we might call the petroleum interval,
p61
aVit's a short period in history
p62
aVwhere we've discovered this extraordinary material,
p63
aVand then based a whole way of life around it.
p64
aVBut as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage,
p65
aVwe move from a time where our economic success,
p66
aVour sense of individual prowess and well-being
p67
aVis directly linked to how much of this we consume,
p68
aVto a time when actually our degree of oil dependency
p69
aVis our degree of vulnerability.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd it's increasingly clear that we
p72
aVaren't going to be able to rely on the fact that
p73
aVwe're going to have this at our disposal forever.
p74
aVFor every four barrels of oil that we consume,
p75
aVwe only discover one.
p76
aVAnd that gap continues to widen.
p77
aVThere is also the fact that the amount of energy
p78
aVthat we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.
p79
aVIn the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back
p80
aVfor every one that we put in to extract it.
p81
aVCompletely unprecedented, historically.
p82
aVAlready that's fallen to about 11.
p83
aVAnd that's why, now,
p84
aVthe new breakthroughs, the new frontiers
p85
aVin terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta,
p86
aVor at the bottom of the oceans.
p87
aa(lp88
VThere are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.
p89
aVBut of those, 65 have already passed their peak.
p90
aVThe moment when the world on average passes this peak,
p91
aVpeople wonder when that's going to happen.
p92
aVAnd there is an emerging case
p93
aVthat maybe that was what happened last July
p94
aVwhen the oil prices were so high.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut are we to assume that the same brilliance
p97
aVand creativity and adaptability
p98
aVthat got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place
p99
aVis somehow mysteriously going to evaporate
p100
aVwhen we have to design a creative way back down the other side?
p101
aVNo. But the thinking that we have to come up with
p102
aVhas to be based on a realistic assessment
p103
aVof where we are.
p104
aa(lp105
VThere is also the issue of climate change,
p106
aVis the other thing that underpins this transition approach.
p107
aVBut the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists,
p108
aVis the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes,
p109
aVas the data that's coming in,
p110
aVwhich is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.
p111
aVSo the IPCC said
p112
aVthat we might see significant breakup
p113
aVof the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.
p114
aVActually, if current trends continue,
p115
aVit could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.
p116
aVIf just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost
p117
aVis released as the world warms,
p118
aVit would offset all the savings that we need to make,
p119
aVin carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.
p120
aVWe have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut I'm always very interested to think about
p123
aVwhat might the stories be
p124
aVthat the generations further down the slope from us
p125
aVare going to tell about us.
p126
aV"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain,
p127
aVthat partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance."
p128
aVAnd one of the ways I like to do that
p129
aVis to look back at the stories people used to tell
p130
aVbefore we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels,
p131
aVand people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy,
p132
aVor a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.
p133
aa(lp134
VWe had stories like "The Seven-League Boots":
p135
aVthe giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on,
p136
aVwith every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles,
p137
aVa kind of travel completely unimaginable
p138
aVto people without that kind of energy at their disposal.
p139
aa(lp140
VStories like The Magic Porridge Pot,
p141
aVwhere you had a pot where if you knew the magic words,
p142
aVthis pot would just make as much food as you liked,
p143
aVwithout you having to do any work,
p144
aVprovided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.
p145
aVOtherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.
p146
aa(lp147
VThere is the story of "The Elves and the Shoemaker."
p148
aVThe people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning,
p149
aVand all the shoes are magically made for them.
p150
aVIt's something that was unimaginable to people then.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow we have the seven-league boots
p153
aVin the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.
p154
aVWe have the magic porridge pot
p155
aVin the form of Walmart and Tesco.
p156
aVAnd we have the elves in the form of China.
p157
aVBut we don't appreciate what an astonishing
p158
aVthing that has been.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd what are the stories that we tell ourselves now,
p161
aVas we look forward about where we're going to go.
p162
aVAnd I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual,
p163
aVthat the future will be like the present, just more of it.
p164
aVBut as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea
p165
aVthat is increasingly coming into question.
p166
aVAnd in terms of climate change,
p167
aVis something that is not actually feasible.
p168
aa(lp169
VThere is the idea of hitting the wall,
p170
aVthat actually somehow everything is so fragile
p171
aVthat it might just all unravel and collapse.
p172
aVThis is a popular story in some places.
p173
aVThe third story is the idea that technology can solve everything,
p174
aVthat technology can somehow get us through this completely.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks,
p177
aVthe idea that we can invent our way out of a profound
p178
aVeconomic and energy crisis,
p179
aVthat a move to a knowledge economy
p180
aVcan somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints,
p181
aVthe idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy
p182
aVthat will mean we can sweep all concerns
p183
aVabout energy security to one side,
p184
aVthe idea that we can step off neatly
p185
aVonto a completely renewable world.
p186
aa(lp187
VBut the world isn't Second Life.
p188
aVWe can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.
p189
aVAnd as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other,
p190
aVthere are still people mining coal
p191
aVin order to power the servers, extracting the minerals
p192
aVto make all of those things.
p193
aVThe breakfast that we eat as we sit down
p194
aVto check our email in the morning
p195
aVis still transported at great distances,
p196
aVusually at the expense of the local, more resilient
p197
aVfood systems that would have supplied that in the past,
p198
aVwhich we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.
p199
aa(lp200
VWe can be astonishingly inventive and creative.
p201
aVBut we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.
p202
aVEnergy and technology are not the same thing.
p203
aVWhat I'm involved with is the transition response.
p204
aVAnd this is really about looking the challenges
p205
aVof peak oil and climate change square in the face,
p206
aVand responding with a creativity and an adaptability
p207
aVand an imagination that we really need.
p208
aVIt's something which has spread incredibly fast.
p209
aVAnd it is something which has several characteristics.
p210
aa(lp211
VIt's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.
p212
aVIt's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it
p213
aVdevelops and passes on as they work with it.
p214
aVIt's self-organizing. There is no great central organization
p215
aVthat pushes this; people just pick up an idea
p216
aVand they run with it, and they implement it where they are.
p217
aVIt's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do
p218
aVwhere they are, to respond to this.
p219
aVIt's sensitive to place and to scale.
p220
aa(lp221
VTransitional is completely different.
p222
aVTransition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here,
p223
aVwhat they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.
p224
aVIt learns very much from its mistakes.
p225
aVAnd it feels historic. It tries to create a sense
p226
aVthat this is a historic opportunity
p227
aVto do something really extraordinary.
p228
aVAnd it's a process which is really joyful.
p229
aVPeople have a huge amount of fun doing this,
p230
aVreconnecting with other people as they do it.
p231
aVOne of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience
p234
aVis a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.
p235
aVThe idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.
p236
aVAnd it's really about how systems,
p237
aVsettlements, withstand shock from the outside.
p238
aVWhen they encounter shock from the outside
p239
aVthat they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.
p240
aVAnd I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.
p241
aa(lp242
VWhen our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them
p243
aVat any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on
p244
aVthe energy efficiency of the freezers
p245
aVand on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.
p246
aVLooking through the lens of resilience,
p247
aVwe really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation
p248
aVthat's so vulnerable.
p249
aVResilience runs much deeper:
p250
aVit's about building modularity into what we do,
p251
aVbuilding surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.
p252
aa(lp253
VThis is a photograph of the Bristol and District
p254
aVMarket Gardeners Association, in 1897.
p255
aVThis is at a time when the city of Bristol,
p256
aVwhich is quite close to here,
p257
aVwas surrounded by commercial market gardens,
p258
aVwhich provided a significant amount of the food
p259
aVthat was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.
p260
aVThere was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time,
p261
aVwhich we can now only look back on with envy.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo how does this transition idea work?
p264
aVSo basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.
p265
aVThey pick up some of the tools that we've developed.
p266
aVThey start to run an awareness-raising program
p267
aVlooking at how this might actually work in the town.
p268
aVThey show films, they give talks, and so on.
p269
aVIt's a process which is playful and creative
p270
aVand informative.
p271
aVThen they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this,
p272
aVand then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects
p273
aVwhich then the transition project itself
p274
aVstarts to support and enable.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland,
p277
aVwhere I was teaching, and has since spread.
p278
aVThere are now over 200 formal transition projects.
p279
aVAnd there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.
p280
aVThey are mulling whether they're going to take it further.
p281
aVAnd actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.
p282
aVBut what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea,
p283
aVbut what do they actually do on the ground?
p284
aa(lp285
VWell, I think it's really important to make the point that actually
p286
aVyou know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.
p287
aVWe need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.
p288
aVWe need national responses. We need local government responses.
p289
aVBut all of those things are going to be much easier
p290
aVif we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas
p291
aVand leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable,
p292
aVover the next 5 to 10 years.
p293
aa(lp294
VSome of the things that emerge from it are local food projects,
p295
aVlike community-supported agriculture schemes,
p296
aVurban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.
p297
aVA lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies,
p298
aVcommunity-owned energy companies,
p299
aVwhere the community can invest money into itself,
p300
aVto start putting in place
p301
aVthe kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.
p302
aVA lot of places are working with their local schools.
p303
aVNewent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school;
p304
aVthe kids are learning how to grow food.
p305
aVPromoting recycling, things like garden-share,
p306
aVthat matches up people who don't have a garden
p307
aVwho would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.
p308
aVPlanting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
p309
aVAnd also starting to play around with the idea of
p310
aValternative currencies.
p311
aa(lp312
VThis is Lewes in Sussex,
p313
aVwho have recently launched the Lewes Pound,
p314
aVa currency that you can only spend within the town,
p315
aVas a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.
p316
aVYou take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.
p317
aVBut actually within the town you start to create these economic
p318
aVcycles much more effectively.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnother thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan,
p321
aVwhich is basically to develop a plan B for the town.
p322
aVMost of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan
p323
aVfor the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community,
p324
aVstill start by assuming that there will be more energy,
p325
aVmore cars, more housing,
p326
aVmore jobs, more growth, and so on.
p327
aVWhat does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that
p328
aVand actually come up with something that was actually more likely
p329
aVto sustain everybody?
p330
aVAs a friend of mine says, "Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."
p331
aVAnd that's certainly been my experience with transition.
p332
aVFrom three years ago, it just being an idea,
p333
aVthis has become something that has virally swept around the world.
p334
aVWe're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband,
p335
aVthe energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference
p336
aVas a keynote listener.
p337
aVWhich he did \u2014
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aV(Applause) \u2014
p340
aVand has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.
p341
aa(lp342
VThere are now two local authorities in this country
p343
aVwho have declared themselves transitional local authorities,
p344
aVLeicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud,
p345
aVthe transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan.
p346
aVAnd the head of the council said,
p347
aV"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent
p348
aVall of that community infrastructure for the first time."
p349
aVAs we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.
p350
aa(lp351
VIn Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund
p352
aVhas funded Transition Scotland
p353
aVas a national organization supporting the spread of this.
p354
aVAnd we see it all over the place as well now.
p355
aVBut the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now,
p356
aVbut that things are already inevitably changing,
p357
aVand what we need to do is to work creatively with that,
p358
aVbased on asking the right questions.
p359
aa(lp360
VI think I'd like to just return at the end
p361
aVto the idea of stories.
p362
aVBecause I think stories are vital here.
p363
aVAnd actually the stories that we tell ourselves,
p364
aVwe have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.
p365
aVAnd one of the key things that transition does
p366
aVis to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
p367
aVStories about the community that's produced
p368
aVits own 21 pound note, for example,
p369
aVthe school that's turned its car park into a food garden,
p370
aVthe community that's founded its own energy company.
p371
aVAnd for me, one of the great stories recently
p372
aVwas the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House
p373
aVto create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done,
p374
aVwhen Eleanor Roosevelt did it,
p375
aVit led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo the question I'd like to leave you with, really,
p378
aVis \u2014 for all aspects of the things that your community needs
p379
aVin order to thrive,
p380
aVhow can it be done in such a way
p381
aVthat drastically reduces its carbon emissions,
p382
aVwhile also building resilience?
p383
aa(lp384
VPersonally, I feel enormously grateful
p385
aVto have lived through the age of cheap oil.
p386
aVI've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.
p387
aVBut let us honor what it has bought us,
p388
aVand move forward from this point.
p389
aVBecause if we cling to it, and continue to assume
p390
aVthat it can underpin our choices,
p391
aVthe future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.
p392
aVAnd by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us,
p393
aVand that the Oil Age has done for us,
p394
aVwe are able to then begin the creation
p395
aVof a world which is more resilient,
p396
aVmore nourishing,
p397
aVand in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled
p398
aVand more connected to each other.
p399
aVThank you very much.

VI thought I would start with a very brief history of cities.
p5
aVSettlements typically began with people clustered around a well,
p6
aVand the size of that settlement was roughly the distance you could walk
p7
aVwith a pot of water on your head.
p8
aVIn fact, if you fly over Germany, for example,
p9
aVand you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages,
p10
aVthey're all about a mile apart.
p11
aVYou needed easy access to the fields.
p12
aVAnd for hundreds, even thousands of years,
p13
aVthe home was really the center of life.
p14
aVLife was very small for most people.
p15
aVIt was a center of entertainment, of energy production, of work,
p16
aVa center of health care.
p17
aVThat's where babies were born and people died.
p18
aa(lp19
VThen, with industrialization, everything started to become centralized.
p20
aVYou had dirty factories that were moved to the outskirts of cities.
p21
aVProduction was centralized in assembly plants.
p22
aVYou had centralized energy production.
p23
aVLearning took place in schools.
p24
aVHealth care took place in hospitals.
p25
aVAnd then you had networks that developed.
p26
aVYou had water, sewer networks
p27
aVthat allowed for this kind of unchecked expansion.
p28
aVYou had separated functions, increasingly.
p29
aVYou had rail networks
p30
aVthat connected residential, industrial, commercial areas.
p31
aVYou had auto networks.
p32
aVIn fact, the model was really, give everybody a car,
p33
aVbuild roads to everything,
p34
aVand give people a place to park when they get there.
p35
aVIt was not a very functional model.
p36
aVAnd we still live in that world,
p37
aVand this is what we end up with.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo you have the sprawl of LA,
p40
aVthe sprawl of Mexico City.
p41
aVYou have these unbelievable new cities in China,
p42
aVwhich you might call tower sprawl.
p43
aVThey're all building cities
p44
aVon the model that we invented in the '50s and '60s,
p45
aVwhich is really obsolete, I would argue,
p46
aVand there are hundreds and hundreds of new cities
p47
aVthat are being planned all over the world.
p48
aVIn China alone, 300 million people, some say 400 million people,
p49
aVwill move to the city over the next 15 years.
p50
aVThat means building the equivalent
p51
aVof the entire built infrastructure of the US in 15 years.
p52
aVImagine that.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd we should all care about this whether you live in cities or not.
p55
aVCities will account for 90 percent of the population growth,
p56
aV80 percent of the global CO2, 75 percent of energy use,
p57
aVbut at the same time it's where people want to be,
p58
aVincreasingly.
p59
aVMore than half the people now in the world live in cities,
p60
aVand that will just continue to escalate.
p61
aa(lp62
VCities are places of celebration, personal expression.
p63
aVYou have the flash mobs of pillow fights that \u2014
p64
aVI've been to a couple. They're quite fun.
p65
aVYou have \u2014
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VCities are where most of the wealth is created,
p70
aVand particularly in the developing world, it's where women find opportunities.
p71
aVThat's a lot of the reason why cities are growing very quickly.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow there's some trends that will impact cities.
p74
aVFirst of all, work is becoming distributed and mobile.
p75
aVThe office building is basically obsolete for doing private work.
p76
aVThe home, once again, because of distributed computation \u2014
p77
aVCommunication is becoming a center of life,
p78
aVso it's a center of production and learning and shopping and health care
p79
aVand all of these things that we used to think of
p80
aVas taking place outside of the home.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd increasingly, everything that people buy,
p83
aVevery consumer product,
p84
aVin one way or another, can be personalized.
p85
aVAnd that's a very important trend to think about.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo this is my image of the city of the future.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VIn that it's a place for people, you know.
p92
aVMaybe not the way people dress, but \u2014
p93
aVYou know, the question now is,
p94
aVhow can we have all the good things that we identify with cities
p95
aVwithout all the bad things?
p96
aa(lp97
VThis is Bangalore.
p98
aVIt took me a couple of hours to get a few miles in Bangalore last year.
p99
aVSo with cities, you also have congestion and pollution
p100
aVand disease and all these negative things.
p101
aVHow can we have the good stuff without the bad?
p102
aa(lp103
VSo we went back and started looking at the great cities
p104
aVthat evolved before the cars.
p105
aVParis was a series of these little villages that came together,
p106
aVand you still see that structure today.
p107
aVThe 20 arrondissements of Paris are these little neighborhoods.
p108
aVMost of what people need in life can be within a five- or 10-minute walk.
p109
aVAnd if you look at the data, when you have that kind of a structure,
p110
aVyou get a very even distribution
p111
aVof the shops and the physicians and the pharmacies
p112
aVand the cafes in Paris.
p113
aVAnd then you look at cities that evolved after the automobile,
p114
aVand it's not that kind of a pattern.
p115
aVThere's very little that's within a five-minute walk
p116
aVof most areas of places like Pittsburgh.
p117
aVNot to pick on Pittsburgh,
p118
aVbut most American cities really have evolved this way.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo we said, well, let's look at new cities,
p121
aVand we're involved in a couple of new city projects in China.
p122
aVSo we said, let's start with that neighborhood cell.
p123
aVWe think of it as a compact urban cell.
p124
aVSo provide most of what most people want within that 20-minute walk.
p125
aVThis can also be a resilient electrical microgrid,
p126
aVcommunity heating, power, communication networks, etc.
p127
aVcan be concentrated there.
p128
aVStewart Brand would put a micronuclear reactor
p129
aVright in the center, probably.
p130
aVAnd he might be right.
p131
aVAnd then we can form, in effect, a mesh network.
p132
aVIt's something of an Internet typology pattern,
p133
aVso you can have a series of these neighborhoods.
p134
aVYou can dial up the density \u2014
p135
aVabout 20,000 people per cell, if it's Cambridge.
p136
aVGo up to 50,000 if it's Manhattan density.
p137
aVYou connect everything with mass transit
p138
aVand you provide most of what most people need within that neighborhood.
p139
aVYou can begin to develop a whole typology of streetscapes
p140
aVand the vehicles that can go on them.
p141
aVI won't go through all of them. I'll just show one.
p142
aa(lp143
VThis is Boulder. It's a great example of kind of a mobility parkway,
p144
aVa superhighway for joggers and bicyclists,
p145
aVwhere you can go from one end of the city to the other
p146
aVwithout crossing the street,
p147
aVand they also have bike-sharing, which I'll get into in a minute.
p148
aa(lp149
VThis is even a more interesting solution
p150
aVin Seoul, Korea.
p151
aVThey took the elevated highway, they got rid of it,
p152
aVthey reclaimed the street, the river down below,
p153
aVbelow the street,
p154
aVand you can go from one end of Seoul to the other
p155
aVwithout crossing a pathway for cars.
p156
aa(lp157
VThe High Line in Manhattan is very similar.
p158
aVYou have these rapidly emerging bike lanes all over the world.
p159
aVI lived in Manhattan for 15 years.
p160
aVI went back a couple of weekends ago,
p161
aVtook this photograph of these fabulous new bike lanes that they have installed.
p162
aVThey're still not to where Copenhagen is,
p163
aVwhere something like 42 percent of the trips within the city
p164
aVare by bicycle.
p165
aVIt's mostly just because they have fantastic infrastructure there.
p166
aa(lp167
VWe actually did exactly the wrong thing in Boston.
p168
aVThe Big Dig \u2014
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VSo we got rid of the highway but we created a traffic island,
p173
aVand it's certainly not a mobility pathway for anything other than cars.
p174
aa(lp175
VMobility on demand is something we've been thinking about,
p176
aVso we think we need an ecosystem of these shared-use vehicles
p177
aVconnected to mass transit.
p178
aVThese are some of the vehicles that we've been working on.
p179
aVBut shared use is really key.
p180
aVIf you share a vehicle, you can have at least four people use one vehicle,
p181
aVas opposed to one.
p182
aVWe have Hubway here in Boston, the Vélib' system in Paris.
p183
aa(lp184
VWe've been developing, at the Media Lab, this little city car
p185
aVthat is optimized for shared use in cities.
p186
aVWe got rid of all the useless things like engines and transmissions.
p187
aVWe moved everything to the wheels,
p188
aVso you have the drive motor,
p189
aVthe steering motor, the breaking \u2014 all in the wheel.
p190
aVThat left the chassis unencumbered, so you can do things like fold,
p191
aVso you can fold this little vehicle up to occupy a tiny little footprint.
p192
aa(lp193
VThis was a video that was on European television last week
p194
aVshowing the Spanish Minister of Industry driving this little vehicle,
p195
aVand when it's folded, it can spin.
p196
aVYou don't need reverse. You don't need parallel parking.
p197
aVYou just spin and go directly in.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VSo we've been working with a company to commercialize this.
p202
aVMy PhD student Ryan Chin presented these early ideas
p203
aVtwo years ago at a TEDx conference.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo what's interesting is,
p206
aVthen if you begin to add new things to it, like autonomy,
p207
aVyou get out of the car, you park at your destination,
p208
aVyou pat it on the butt, it goes and it parks itself, it charges itself,
p209
aVand you can get something like seven times as many vehicles
p210
aVin a given area as conventional cars,
p211
aVand we think this is the future.
p212
aVActually, we could do this today. It's not really a problem.
p213
aVWe can combine shared use and folding and autonomy
p214
aVand we get something like 28 times the land utilization
p215
aVwith that kind of strategy.
p216
aa(lp217
VOne of our graduate students then says,
p218
aVwell, how does a driverless car communicate with pedestrians?
p219
aVYou have nobody to make eye contact with.
p220
aVYou don't know if it's going to run you over.
p221
aVSo he's developing strategies
p222
aVso the vehicle can communicate with pedestrians, so \u2014
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VSo the headlights are eyeballs, the pupils can dilate,
p227
aVwe have directional audio, we can throw sound directly at people.
p228
aVWhat I love about this project
p229
aVis he solved a problem that doesn't exist yet, so \u2014
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VWe also think that we can democratize access to bike lanes.
p234
aVYou know, bike lanes are mostly used by young guys in stretchy pants. So \u2014
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VWe think we can develop a vehicle that operates on bike lanes,
p239
aVaccessible to elderly and disabled, women in skirts, businesspeople,
p240
aVand address the issues of energy congestion, mobility,
p241
aVaging and obesity simultaneously.
p242
aVThat's our challenge.
p243
aa(lp244
VThis is an early design for this little three-wheel.
p245
aVIt's an electronic bike.
p246
aVYou have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane,
p247
aVbut if you're an older person, that's a switch.
p248
aVIf you're a healthy person, you might have to work really hard to go fast.
p249
aVYou can dial in 40 calories going into work
p250
aVand 500 going home, when you can take a shower.
p251
aVWe hope to have that built this fall.
p252
aa(lp253
VHousing is another area where we can really improve.
p254
aVMayor Menino in Boston says
p255
aVlack of affordable housing for young people
p256
aVis one of the biggest problems the city faces.
p257
aVDevelopers say, OK, we'll build little teeny apartments.
p258
aVPeople say, we don't really want to live in a little teeny conventional apartment.
p259
aVSo we're saying, let's build a standardized chassis,
p260
aVmuch like our car.
p261
aVLet's bring advanced technology into the apartment,
p262
aVtechnology-enabled infill,
p263
aVgive people the tools within this open-loft chassis
p264
aVto go through a process of defining
p265
aVwhat their needs and values and activities are,
p266
aVand then a matching algorithm will match a unique assembly
p267
aVof integrated infill components,
p268
aVfurniture, and cabinetry, that are personalized to that individual,
p269
aVand they give them the tools
p270
aVto go through the process and to refine it,
p271
aVand it's something like working with an architect,
p272
aVwhere the dialogue starts
p273
aVwhen you give an alternative to a person to react to.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow, the most interesting implementation of that for us
p276
aVis when you can begin to have robotic walls,
p277
aVso your space can convert from exercise to a workplace,
p278
aVif you run a virtual company.
p279
aVYou have guests over,
p280
aVyou have two guest rooms that are developed.
p281
aVYou have a conventional one-bedroom arrangement
p282
aVwhen you need it.
p283
aVMaybe that's most of the time.
p284
aVYou have a dinner party.
p285
aVThe table folds out to fit 16 people in otherwise a conventional one-bedroom,
p286
aVor maybe you want a dance studio.
p287
aVI mean, architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time.
p288
aVWhat we need to do now,
p289
aVdevelop things that can scale to those 300 million Chinese people
p290
aVthat would like to live in the city, and very comfortably.
p291
aVWe think we can make a very small apartment
p292
aVthat functions as if it's twice as big by utilizing these strategies.
p293
aVI don't believe in smart homes. That's sort of a bogus concept.
p294
aVI think you have to build dumb homes and put smart stuff in it.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd so we've been working on a chassis of the wall itself.
p299
aVYou know, standardized platform
p300
aVwith the motors and the battery when it operates,
p301
aVlittle solenoids that will lock it in place and get low-voltage power.
p302
aVWe think this can all be standardized,
p303
aVand then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall,
p304
aVand like the car, we can integrate all kinds of sensing
p305
aVto be aware of human activity,
p306
aVso if there's a baby or a puppy in the way,
p307
aVyou won't have a problem.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VSo the developers say, well, this is great.
p312
aVOK, so if we have a conventional building, we have a fixed envelope,
p313
aVmaybe we can put in 14 units.
p314
aVIf they function as if they're twice as big,
p315
aVwe can get 28 units in.
p316
aVThat means twice as much parking, though.
p317
aVParking's really expensive.
p318
aVIt's about 70,000 dollars per space
p319
aVto build a conventional parking spot inside a building.
p320
aVSo if you can have folding and autonomy,
p321
aVyou can do that in one-seventh of the space.
p322
aVThat goes down to 10,000 dollars per car,
p323
aVjust for the cost of the parking.
p324
aVYou add shared use, and you can even go further.
p325
aa(lp326
VWe can also integrate all kinds of advanced technology
p327
aVthrough this process.
p328
aVThere's a path to market for innovative companies
p329
aVto bring technology into the home.
p330
aVIn this case, a project we're doing with Siemens.
p331
aVWe have sensors on all the furniture, all the infill,
p332
aVthat understands where people are and what they're doing.
p333
aVBlue light is very efficient,
p334
aVso we have these tunable 24-bit LED lighting fixtures.
p335
aVIt recognizes where the person is, what they're doing,
p336
aVfills out the light when necessary to full spectrum white light,
p337
aVand saves maybe 30, 40 percent in energy consumption, we think,
p338
aVover even conventional state-of-the-art lighting systems.
p339
aVThis just shows you the data that comes from the sensors
p340
aVthat are embedded in the furniture.
p341
aVWe don't really believe in cameras to do things in homes.
p342
aVWe think these little wireless sensors are more effective.
p343
aa(lp344
VWe think we can also personalize sunlight.
p345
aVThat's sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways.
p346
aVSo we've looked at articulating mirrors of the facade
p347
aVthat can throw shafts of sunlight anywhere into the space,
p348
aVtherefore allowing you to shade most of the glass
p349
aVon a hot day like today.
p350
aVIn this case, she picks up her phone,
p351
aVshe can map food preparation at the kitchen island
p352
aVto a particular location of sunlight.
p353
aVAn algorithm will keep it in that location as long as she's engaged in that activity.
p354
aVThis can be combined with LED lighting as well.
p355
aa(lp356
VWe think workplaces should be shared.
p357
aVI mean, this is really the workplace of the future, I think.
p358
aVThis is Starbucks, you know.
p359
aVMaybe a third \u2014
p360
aVAnd you see everybody has their back to the wall
p361
aVand they have food and coffee down the way
p362
aVand they're in their own little personal bubble.
p363
aVWe need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration.
p364
aVWe're not doing a very good job with that.
p365
aVAt the Cambridge Innovation Center, you can have shared desks.
p366
aVI've spent a lot of time in Finland at the design factory of Aalto University,
p367
aVwhere the they have a shared shop and shared fab lab, shared quiet spaces,
p368
aVelectronics spaces, recreation places.
p369
aa(lp370
VWe think ultimately, all of this stuff can come together,
p371
aVa new model for mobility, a new model for housing,
p372
aVa new model for how we live and work,
p373
aVa path to market for advanced technologies.
p374
aVBut in the end, the main thing we need to focus on are people.
p375
aVCities are all about people.
p376
aVThey're places for people.
p377
aVThere's no reason why we can't dramatically improve
p378
aVthe livability and creativity of cities
p379
aVlike they've done in Melbourne with the laneways
p380
aVwhile at the same time dramatically reducing CO2 and energy.
p381
aVIt's a global imperative. We have to get this right.
p382
aa(lp383
VThank you.

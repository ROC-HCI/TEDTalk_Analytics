VI just met you on a bus,
p5
aVand we would really like  to get to know each other,
p6
aVbut I've got to get off at the next stop,
p7
aVso you're going to tell me  three things about yourself
p8
aVthat just define you as a person,
p9
aVthree things about yourself
p10
aVthat will help me understand who you are,
p11
aVthree things that just  get to your very essence.
p12
aVAnd what I'm wondering
p13
aVis, of those three things,
p14
aVis any one of them
p15
aVsurviving some kind of trauma?
p16
aVCancer survivor, rape survivor,
p17
aVHolocaust survivor, incest survivor.
p18
aa(lp19
VEver notice how we tend to identify ourselves
p20
aVby our wounds?
p21
aVAnd where I have seen this survivor identity
p22
aVhave the most consequences
p23
aVis in the cancer community.
p24
aVAnd I've been around this  community for a long time,
p25
aVbecause I've been a hospice  and a hospital chaplain
p26
aVfor almost 30 years.
p27
aVAnd in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center
p28
aVwhen I received the news that
p29
aVmy mother had breast cancer.
p30
aVAnd then five days later,
p31
aVI received the news that I had breast cancer.
p32
aVMy mother and I can be competitive \u2014
p33
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p34
aVbut I was really not trying to compete with her on this one.
p35
aVAnd in fact, I thought, well,
p36
aVif you have to have cancer,
p37
aVit's pretty convenient to be working
p38
aVat a place that treats it.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut this is what I heard from  a lot of outraged people.
p41
aVWhat?
p42
aVYou're the chaplain.
p43
aVYou should be immune.
p44
aVLike, maybe I should have just gotten off
p45
aVwith a warning instead of an actual ticket,
p46
aVbecause I'm on the force.
p47
aVSo I did get my treatment at the cancer center where I worked,
p48
aVwhich was amazingly convenient,
p49
aVand I had chemotherapy
p50
aVand a mastectomy, and a saline implant put in,
p51
aVand so before I say another word, let me just say right now,
p52
aVthis is the fake one. (Laughter)
p53
aVI have found that I need to get that out of the way,
p54
aVbecause I'll see somebody go
p55
aV"Oh, I know it's this one."
p56
aVAnd then I'll move or I'll  gesture and they'll go,
p57
aV"No, it's that one."
p58
aVSo now you know.
p59
aa(lp60
VI learned a lot being a patient,
p61
aVand one of the surprising things was
p62
aVthat only a small part of the cancer experience
p63
aVis about medicine.
p64
aVMost of it is about feelings and faith
p65
aVand losing and finding your identity
p66
aVand discovering strength
p67
aVand flexibility you never even knew you had.
p68
aVIt's about realizing that
p69
aVthe most important things in life are
p70
aVnot things at all, but relationships,
p71
aVand it's about laughing in the face of uncertainty
p72
aVand learning that the way to get out of almost anything
p73
aVis to say, "I have cancer."
p74
aa(lp75
VSo the other thing I learned was that
p76
aVI don't have to take on "cancer survivor"
p77
aVas my identity,
p78
aVbut, boy, are there powerful forces
p79
aVpushing me to do just that.
p80
aVNow, don't, please, misunderstand me.
p81
aVCancer organizations
p82
aVand the drive for early screening
p83
aVand cancer awareness and cancer research
p84
aVhave normalized cancer,
p85
aVand this is a wonderful thing.
p86
aVWe can now talk about cancer
p87
aVwithout whispering.
p88
aVWe can talk about cancer and we can support one another.
p89
aVBut sometimes, it feels
p90
aVlike people go a little overboard
p91
aVand they start telling us how we're going to feel.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo about a week after my surgery,
p94
aVwe had a houseguest.
p95
aVThat was probably our first mistake.
p96
aVAnd keep in mind that
p97
aVat this point in my life
p98
aVI had been a chaplain for over 20 years,
p99
aVand issues like dying and death
p100
aVand the meaning of life,
p101
aVthese are all things I'd been  yakking about forever.
p102
aVSo at dinner that night,
p103
aVour houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head,
p104
aVand say, "You know, Deb,
p105
aVnow you're really going to learn what's important.
p106
aVYes, you are going to make some big changes
p107
aVin your life,
p108
aVand now you're going to start thinking about your death.
p109
aVYep, this cancer is your wakeup call."
p110
aVNow, these are golden words
p111
aVcoming from someone who is speaking about
p112
aVtheir own experience,
p113
aVbut when someone is telling you
p114
aVhow you are going to feel,
p115
aVit's instant crap.
p116
aVThe only reason I did not kill him
p117
aVwith my bare hands
p118
aVwas because I could not lift my right arm.
p119
aVBut I did say a really bad word to him,
p120
aVfollowed by a regular word, that \u2014
p121
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p122
aVmade my husband say, "She's on narcotics."
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVAnd then after my treatment, it just felt like
p125
aVeveryone was telling me what my experience was going to mean.
p126
aV"Oh, this means you're going to be doing the walk."
p127
aV"Oh, this means you're coming to the luncheon."
p128
aV"This means you're going to be wearing
p129
aVthe pink ribbon and the pink t-shirt
p130
aVand the headband and the earrings
p131
aVand the bracelet and the panties."
p132
aVPanties. No, seriously, google it.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVHow is that raising awareness?
p135
aVOnly my husband should be seeing my panties.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVHe's pretty aware of cancer already.
p138
aa(lp139
VIt was at that point where I felt like, oh my God,
p140
aVthis is just taking over my life.
p141
aVAnd that's when I told myself,  claim your experience.
p142
aVDon't let it claim you.
p143
aVWe all know that
p144
aVthe way to cope with trauma, with loss,
p145
aVwith any life-changing experience,
p146
aVis to find meaning.
p147
aVBut here's the thing:
p148
aVNo one can tell us
p149
aVwhat our experience means.
p150
aVWe have to decide what it means.
p151
aVAnd it doesn't have to be some gigantic,
p152
aVextroverted meaning.
p153
aVWe don't all have to start a foundation
p154
aVor an organization or write a book
p155
aVor make a documentary.
p156
aVMeaning can be quiet
p157
aVand introverted.
p158
aVMaybe we make one small decision about our lives
p159
aVthat can bring about big change.
p160
aa(lp161
VMany years ago, I had a patient,
p162
aVjust a wonderful young man
p163
aVwho was loved by the staff,
p164
aVand so it was something of a shock to us to realize
p165
aVthat he had no friends.
p166
aVHe lived by himself,
p167
aVhe would come in for chemotherapy by himself,
p168
aVhe would receive his treatment,
p169
aVand then he'd walk home alone.
p170
aVAnd I even asked him. I said, "Hey,
p171
aVhow come you never bring a friend with you?"
p172
aVAnd he said, "I don't really have any friends."
p173
aVBut he had tons of friends on the infusion floor.
p174
aVWe all loved him, and people were going in and out of his room all the time.
p175
aVSo at his last chemo,
p176
aVwe sang him the song
p177
aVand we put the crown on his  head and we blew the bubbles,
p178
aVand then I asked him, I said,
p179
aV"So what are you going to do now?"
p180
aVAnd he answered,
p181
aV"Make friends."
p182
aVAnd he did.
p183
aVHe started volunteering  and he made friends there,
p184
aVand he began going to a church and he made friends there,
p185
aVand at Christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment,
p186
aVand the place was filled with his friends.
p187
aVClaim your experience.
p188
aVDon't let it claim you.
p189
aVHe decided that the meaning of his experience
p190
aVwas to know the joy of friendship,
p191
aVand then learn to make friends.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo what about you?
p194
aVHow are you going to find meaning
p195
aVin your crappy experience?
p196
aVIt could be a recent one,
p197
aVor it could be one that you've been carrying around
p198
aVfor a really long time.
p199
aVIt's never too late to change what it means,
p200
aVbecause meaning is dynamic.
p201
aVWhat it means today
p202
aVmay not be what it means a year from now,
p203
aVor 10 years from now.
p204
aVIt's never too late to become someone other
p205
aVthan simply a survivor.
p206
aVHear how static that word sounds?
p207
aVSurvivor.
p208
aVNo movement, no growth.
p209
aVClaim your experience.
p210
aVDon't let it claim you, because if you do,
p211
aVI believe you will become trapped,
p212
aVyou will not grow, you will not evolve.
p213
aa(lp214
VBut of course, sometimes it's not outside pressures
p215
aVthat cause us to take on that identity of survivor.
p216
aVSometimes we just like the perks.
p217
aVSometimes there's a payoff.
p218
aVBut then we get stuck.
p219
aVNow, one of the first things I learned
p220
aVas a chaplain intern was the three C's
p221
aVof the chaplain's job:
p222
aVComfort, clarify and, when necessary, confront
p223
aVor challenge.
p224
aVNow, we all pretty much love the comforting
p225
aVand the clarifying.
p226
aVThe confronting, not so much.
p227
aa(lp228
VOne of the other things that I loved
p229
aVabout being a chaplain was
p230
aVseeing patients a year, or even several years
p231
aVafter their treatment, because
p232
aVit was just really cool to see  how they had changed
p233
aVand how their lives had evolved
p234
aVand what had happened to them.
p235
aVSo I was thrilled one day
p236
aVto get a page down into the lobby of the clinic
p237
aVfrom a patient who I had seen the year before,
p238
aVand she was there with her two adult daughters,
p239
aVwho I also knew, for her one year follow-up exam.
p240
aVSo I got down to the lobby, and they were ecstatic
p241
aVbecause she had just gotten all of her test results back
p242
aVand she was NED: No Evidence of Disease.
p243
aVWhich I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead.
p244
aVSo they were ecstatic, we sat down to visit,
p245
aVand it was so weird, because
p246
aVwithin two minutes, she  started retelling me the story
p247
aVof her diagnosis and her  surgery and her chemo,
p248
aVeven though, as her chaplain,  I saw her every week,
p249
aVand so I knew this story.
p250
aVAnd she was using words like suffering,
p251
aVagony, struggle.
p252
aVAnd she ended her story with,
p253
aV"I felt crucified."
p254
aVAnd at that point, her two  daughters got up and said,
p255
aV"We're going to go get coffee."
p256
aVAnd they left.
p257
aVTell me three things about yourself before the next stop.
p258
aVPeople were leaving the bus before she even got
p259
aVto number two or number three.
p260
aVSo I handed her a tissue,
p261
aVand I gave her a hug,
p262
aVand then, because I really cared for this woman,
p263
aVI said,
p264
aV"Get down off your cross."
p265
aVAnd she said, "What?"
p266
aVAnd I repeated, "Get down off your cross."
p267
aVAnd to her credit, she could  talk about her reasons
p268
aVfor embracing and then clinging to this identity.
p269
aVIt got her a lot of attention.
p270
aVPeople were taking care of her for a change.
p271
aVBut now, it was having the opposite effect.
p272
aVIt was pushing people away.
p273
aVPeople kept leaving to get coffee.
p274
aVShe felt crucified by her experience,
p275
aVbut she didn't want to let that crucified self die.
p276
aVNow, perhaps you are thinking
p277
aVI was a little harsh with her,
p278
aVso I must tell you that
p279
aVI was speaking out of my own experience.
p280
aVMany, many years before,
p281
aVI had been fired from a job that I loved,
p282
aVand I would not stop talking about my innocence
p283
aVand the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt,
p284
aVuntil finally, just like this woman,
p285
aVpeople were walking away from me,
p286
aVuntil I finally realized
p287
aVI wasn't just processing my feelings,
p288
aVI was feeding them.
p289
aVI didn't want to let that crucified self die.
p290
aVBut we all know that with any resurrection story,
p291
aVyou have to die first.
p292
aVThe Christian story,
p293
aVJesus was dead a whole day in the tomb
p294
aVbefore he was resurrected.
p295
aVAnd I believe that for us,
p296
aVbeing in the tomb
p297
aVmeans doing our own deep inner work
p298
aVaround our wounds
p299
aVand allowing ourselves to be healed.
p300
aVWe have to let that crucified self die
p301
aVso that a new self, a truer self,
p302
aVis born.
p303
aVWe have to let that old story go
p304
aVso that a new story, a truer story,
p305
aVcan be told.
p306
aVClaim your experience. Don't let it claim you.
p307
aa(lp308
VWhat if there were no survivors,
p309
aVmeaning, what if people decided
p310
aVto just claim their trauma as an experience
p311
aVinstead of taking it on as an identity?
p312
aVMaybe it would be the end of being
p313
aVtrapped in our wounds
p314
aVand the beginning of amazing
p315
aVself-exploration and discovery and growth.
p316
aVMaybe it would be the start of defining ourselves
p317
aVby who we have become
p318
aVand who we are becoming.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo perhaps survivor was not
p321
aVone of the three things that you would tell me.
p322
aVNo matter.
p323
aVI just want you all to know that
p324
aVI am really glad that we are on this bus together,
p325
aVand this is my stop.

VI'm a lexicographer.
p5
aVI make dictionaries.
p6
aVAnd my job as a lexicographer
p7
aVis to try to put all the words possible  into the dictionary.
p8
aVMy job is not to decide what a word is; that is your job.
p9
aa(lp10
VEverybody who speaks English  decides together
p11
aVwhat's a word and what's not a word.
p12
aVEvery language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other.
p13
aVNow, sometimes when people are trying  to decide whether a word is good or bad,
p14
aVthey don't really have a good reason.
p15
aVSo they say something like, "Because grammar!"
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVI don't actually really care about grammar too much \u2014 don't tell anybody.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut the word "grammar," actually, there are two kinds of grammar.
p20
aVThere's the kind of grammar that lives inside your brain,
p21
aVand if you're a native  speaker of a language
p22
aVor a good speaker of a language,
p23
aVit's the unconscious rules that you follow when you speak that language.
p24
aVAnd this is what you learn when you learn a language as a child.
p25
aVAnd here's an example:
p26
aVThis is a wug, right?
p27
aVIt's a wug.
p28
aVNow there is another one.
p29
aVThere are two of these.
p30
aVThere are two ...
p31
aVAudience: Wugs.
p32
aVErin McKean: Exactly! You know  how to make the plural of wug.
p33
aVThat rule lives in your brain.
p34
aVYou never had to be taught this rule,  you just understand it.
p35
aVThis is an experiment that was invented by a professor at [Boston University]
p36
aVnamed Jean Berko Gleason back in 1958.
p37
aVSo we've been talking about this  for a long time.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, these kinds of natural rules  that exist in your brain,
p40
aVthey're not like traffic laws, they're more like laws of nature.
p41
aVAnd nobody has to remind you to obey  a law of nature, right?
p42
aVWhen you leave the house in the morning,  your mom doesn't say,
p43
aV"Hey, honey, I think it's going to be cold, take a hoodie,
p44
aVdon't forget to obey the law of gravity."
p45
aVNobody says this.
p46
aVNow, there are other rules that are more about manners than they are about nature.
p47
aVSo you can think of a word as like a hat.
p48
aVOnce you know how hats work,
p49
aVnobody has to tell you,  "Don't wear hats on your feet."
p50
aVWhat they have to tell you is,  "Can you wear hats inside?
p51
aVWho gets to wear a hat?
p52
aVWhat are the kinds of hats you get to wear?"
p53
aVThose are more of the second kind  of grammar,
p54
aVwhich linguists often call usage,  as opposed to grammar.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, sometimes people use this kind of  rules-based grammar
p57
aVto discourage people from making up words.
p58
aVAnd I think that is, well, stupid.
p59
aVSo, for example,  people are always telling you,
p60
aV"Be creative, make new music, do art,  invent things, science and technology."
p61
aVBut when it comes to  words, they're like,
p62
aV"Don't! No. Creativity stops right here, whippersnappers. Give it a rest."
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVBut that makes no sense to me.
p65
aVWords are great. We should have more of them.
p66
aVI want you to make as many new words as possible.
p67
aVAnd I'm going to tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in English.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe first way is the simplest way.
p70
aVBasically, steal them from other  languages.
p71
aV["Go rob other people"] (Laughter)
p72
aVLinguists call this borrowing,
p73
aVbut we never give the words back , so I'm just going to be honest
p74
aVand call it stealing.
p75
aVWe usually take words for things  that we like, like delicious food.
p76
aVWe took "kumquat" from Chinese, we took "caramel" from French.
p77
aVWe also take words  for cool things like "ninja," right?
p78
aVWe took that from Japanese,
p79
aVwhich is kind of a cool trick because  ninjas are hard to steal from.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VSo another way that you  can make words in English
p83
aVis by squishing two  other English words together.
p84
aVThis is called compounding.
p85
aVWords in English are like Lego:
p86
aVIf you use enough force,  you can put any two of them together.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVWe do this all the time in English:
p89
aVWords like "heartbroken," "bookworm,"  "sandcastle" all are compounds.
p90
aVSo go ahead and make words like "duckface," just don't make duckface.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VAnother way that you can make words  in English is kind of like compounding,
p94
aVbut instead you use so much force when you squish the words together
p95
aVthat some parts fall off.
p96
aVSo these are blend words,
p97
aVlike "brunch" is a blend  of "breakfast" and "lunch."
p98
aV"Motel" is a blend of "motor" and "hotel."
p99
aVWho here knew that "motel"  was a blend word?
p100
aVYeah, that word is so old in English
p101
aVthat lots of people don't know that  there are parts missing.
p102
aV"Edutainment" is a blend  of "education" and "entertainment."
p103
aVAnd of course, "electrocute" is a blend of "electric" and "execute."
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VYou can also make words by changing how they operate.
p107
aVThis is called functional shift.
p108
aVYou take a word that acts  as one part of speech,
p109
aVand you change it into another  part of speech.
p110
aVOkay, who here knew that "friend" hasn't always been a verb?
p111
aV"Friend" used to be noun  and then we verbed it.
p112
aVAlmost any word in English can be verbed.
p113
aVYou can also take adjectives  and make them into nouns.
p114
aV"Commercial" used to be an adjective  and now it's a noun.
p115
aVAnd of course, you can "green" things.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnother way to make words in English is back-formation.
p118
aVYou can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit.
p119
aVSo for example, in English we had the word "editor" before we had the word "edit."
p120
aV"Edit" was formed from "editor."
p121
aVSometimes these back-formations  sound a little silly:
p122
aVBulldozers bulldoze, butlers butle  and burglers burgle.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VAnother way to make words in English
p126
aVis to take the first letters of something and squish them together.
p127
aVSo National Aeronautics and Space  Administration becomes NASA.
p128
aVAnd of course you can do this  with anything, OMG!
p129
aa(lp130
VSo it doesn't matter how silly  the words are.
p131
aVThey can be really good words of English.
p132
aV"Absquatulate" is a perfectly  good word of English.
p133
aV"Mugwump" is a perfectly  good word of English.
p134
aVSo the words don't have have to sound  normal, they can sound really silly.
p135
aa(lp136
VWhy should you make words?
p137
aVYou should make words because every word
p138
aVis a chance to express your idea and get  your meaning across.
p139
aVAnd new words grab people's attention.
p140
aVThey get people to focus on what  you're saying
p141
aVand that gives you a better chance to get  your meaning across.
p142
aVA lot of people  on this stage today have said,
p143
aV"In the future, you can do this,
p144
aVyou can help with this, you can  help us explore, you can help us invent."
p145
aVYou can make a new word right now.
p146
aVEnglish has no age limit.
p147
aVGo ahead, start making words today,
p148
aVsend them to me, and I will put them  in my online dictionary, Wordnik.
p149
aVThank you so much.
p150
aV(Applause)

lexicographer involves living in a constant state of research. She searches high and low -- from books to blogs, newspapers to cocktail parties -- for new words, new meanings for old words, or signs that old words have fallen out of use. In June of this year, she involved us all in the search by launching <a href=\\"http://www.wordnik.com/\\">Wordnik</a>, an online dictionary that houses all the traditionally accepted words and definitions, but also asks users to contribute new words and new uses for old words. Wordnik pulls real-time examples of word usage from Twitter, image representations from Flickr along with many more non-traditional, and highly useful, features.&nbsp; </p><p>Before Wordnik, McKean was one of the youngest editors of the <a href=\\"http://www.oed.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em></a>. She continues to serve as the editor of the language quarterly&nbsp; <a href=\\"http://www.verbatimmag.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Verbatim</em></a> (&quot;language and linguistics for the layperson since 1974&quot;) and is the author of multiple books, including&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/thatsamore\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>That&#39;s Amore</em></a>&nbsp;and the entire&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/weirdwonderful\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Weird and Wonderful Words</em></a>&nbsp;series. All that, and she maintains multiple blogs, too: McKean is the keen observationalist behind<a href=\\"http://www.dressaday.com/dressaday.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\"> A Dress a Day</a>  and <a href=\\"http://www.dictionaryevangelist.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Dictionary Evangelist</a>.

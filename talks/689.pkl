VAs an Indian, and now as a politician
p5
aVand a government minister,
p6
aVI've become rather concerned about
p7
aVthe hype we're hearing about our own country,
p8
aVall this talk about India becoming a world leader,
p9
aVeven the next superpower.
p10
aVIn fact, the American publishers of my book,
p11
aV"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,"
p12
aVadded a gratuitous subtitle saying,
p13
aV"India: The next 21st-century power."
p14
aVAnd I just don't think that's what India's all about,
p15
aVor should be all about.
p16
aa(lp17
VIndeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership
p18
aVseems to me terribly archaic.
p19
aVIt's redolent of James Bond movies
p20
aVand Kipling ballads.
p21
aVAfter all, what constitutes a world leader?
p22
aVIf it's population, we're on course to top the charts.
p23
aVWe will overtake China by 2034.
p24
aVIs it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.
p25
aVIs it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.
p26
aVThe Americans have even recognized it,
p27
aVin an agreement.
p28
aVIs it the economy? Well, we have now
p29
aVthe fifth-largest economy in the world
p30
aVin purchasing power parity terms.
p31
aVAnd we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,
p32
aVwe grew at 6.7 percent.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut, somehow, none of that adds up to me,
p35
aVto what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,
p36
aVin this part of the 21st century.
p37
aVAnd so I wondered, could
p38
aVwhat the future beckons for India to be all about
p39
aVbe a combination of these things allied to something else,
p40
aVthe power of example,
p41
aVthe attraction of India's culture,
p42
aVwhat, in other words, people like to call "soft power."
p43
aa(lp44
VSoft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,
p45
aVJoseph Nye, a friend of mine.
p46
aVAnd, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,
p47
aVit's essentially the ability of a country to attract others
p48
aVbecause of its culture, its political values,
p49
aVits foreign policies.
p50
aVAnd, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,
p51
aVbut we know the Alliance Francaise
p52
aVis all about French soft power, the British Council.
p53
aVThe Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.
p54
aVAmericans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.
p55
aVBut, the fact is, in fact,
p56
aVthat probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds
p57
aVhave done more for American soft power
p58
aVaround the world than any specifically government activity.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo soft power is something that really emerges
p61
aVpartly because of governments,
p62
aVbut partly despite governments.
p63
aVAnd in the information era we all live in today,
p64
aVwhat we might call the TED age,
p65
aVI'd say that countries are increasingly being judged
p66
aVby a global public that's been fed
p67
aVon an incessant diet of Internet news,
p68
aVof televised images,
p69
aVof cellphone videos, of email gossip.
p70
aVIn other words, all sorts of communication devices
p71
aVare telling us the stories of countries,
p72
aVwhether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, in this age, again, countries with access
p75
aVto multiple channels of communication
p76
aVand information have a particular advantage.
p77
aVAnd of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.
p78
aVIndia has more all-news TV channels
p79
aVthan any country in the world,
p80
aVin fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut, the fact still is that it's not just that.
p83
aVIn order to have soft power, you have to be connected.
p84
aVOne might argue that India has become
p85
aVan astonishingly connected country.
p86
aVI think you've already heard the figures.
p87
aVWe've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.
p88
aVCurrently there are 509 million cellphones
p89
aVin Indian hands, in India.
p90
aVAnd that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.
p91
aVIn fact, those 15 million cellphones
p92
aVare the most connections that any country,
p93
aVincluding the U.S. and China,
p94
aVhas ever established in the history of telecommunications.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut, what perhaps some of you don't realize
p97
aVis how far we've come to get there.
p98
aVYou know, when I grew up in India,
p99
aVtelephones were a rarity.
p100
aVIn fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament
p101
aVhad the right to allocate 15 telephone lines
p102
aVas a favor to those they deemed worthy.
p103
aVIf you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman
p104
aVor an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.
p105
aVBut sometimes it just sat there.
p106
aa(lp107
VI went to high school in Calcutta.
p108
aVAnd we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.
p109
aVBut half the time we would pick it up
p110
aVwith an expectant look on our faces,
p111
aVthere would be no dial tone.
p112
aVIf there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,
p113
aVthe odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.
p114
aVIn fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello."
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aVIf you then wanted to connect to another city,
p117
aVlet's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,
p118
aVyou'd have to book something called a trunk call,
p119
aVand then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.
p120
aVOr you could pay eight times the going rate
p121
aVfor something called a lightning call.
p122
aVBut, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,
p123
aVso, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.
p124
aa(lp125
VIn fact, so woeful was our telephone service
p126
aVthat a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.
p127
aVAnd the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner
p128
aVthat in a developing country
p129
aVcommunications are a luxury, not a right,
p130
aVthat the government had no obligation to provide better service,
p131
aVand if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,
p132
aVcould he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list
p133
aVfor telephones in India.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:
p136
aVthe 15 million cell phones a month.
p137
aVBut what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.
p138
aVYou know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,
p139
aVon the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart
p140
aVthat looks like it was designed in the 16th century,
p141
aVwielding a coal-fired steam iron
p142
aVthat might have been invented in the 18th century.
p143
aVHe's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.
p144
aVHe's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,
p145
aVand that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,
p146
aVto know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.
p147
aa(lp148
VThe other day I was in Kerala, my home state,
p149
aVat the country farm of a friend,
p150
aVabout 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.
p151
aVAnd it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"
p152
aVAnd it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink
p153
aVon a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.
p154
aVAnd he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,
p155
aVand a voice said, "I'm up here."
p156
aVAnd right on top of the nearest coconut tree,
p157
aVwith a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,
p158
aVwas a local toddy tapper,
p159
aVwho proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.
p160
aa(lp161
VFishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.
p162
aVWhen they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast
p163
aVto find out where they get the best possible prices.
p164
aVFarmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor
p165
aVto find out if the market town was open,
p166
aVif the market was on,
p167
aVwhether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.
p168
aVThey'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge
p169
aVto the market town to get that information and come back,
p170
aVthen they'd load the cart.
p171
aVToday they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo this empowerment of the underclass
p174
aVis the real result of India being connected.
p175
aVAnd that transformation is part of where India is heading today.
p176
aVBut, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.
p177
aVYou've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized
p178
aVin the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump \u2014
p179
aVMr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me \u2014
p180
aVand they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.
p181
aVAnd the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad."
p182
aVAnd the second goat says, "No, the book was better."
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VI usually tend to think that the book is usually better,
p186
aVbut, having said that,
p187
aVthe fact is that Bollywood is now
p188
aVtaking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,
p189
aVnot just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,
p190
aVbut to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.
p191
aVI've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother
p192
aVin a village in Senegal
p193
aVtakes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,
p194
aVjust to watch a Bollywood movie.
p195
aVShe can't understand the dialogue.
p196
aVShe's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.
p197
aVBut these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,
p198
aVand she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.
p199
aVShe goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd this is happening more and more.
p202
aVAfghanistan, we know what a serious security problem
p203
aVAfghanistan is for so many of us in the world.
p204
aVIndia doesn't have a military mission there.
p205
aVYou know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?
p206
aVOne simple fact:
p207
aVyou couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.
p208
aVWhy? Because that was the moment
p209
aVwhen the Indian television soap opera,
p210
aV"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.
p211
aVAnd it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.
p212
aVEvery Afghan family wanted to watch it.
p213
aVThey had to suspend functions at 8:30.
p214
aVWeddings were reported to be interrupted
p215
aVso guests could cluster around the T.V. set,
p216
aVand then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.
p217
aVCrime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch \u2014
p218
aVso this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency \u2014
p219
aVabout how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*
p220
aVstripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,
p221
aVits hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,
p222
aVany moving part they could find, at 8:30,
p223
aVbecause the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.
p224
aVAnd they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,
p225
aV"Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi."
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VThat's soft power. And that is what India is developing
p229
aVthrough the "E" part of TED:
p230
aVits own entertainment industry.
p231
aVThe same is true, of course \u2014 we don't have time for too many more examples \u2014
p232
aVbut it's true of our music, of our dance,
p233
aVof our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.
p234
aVI mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants
p235
aVsince I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,
p236
aVand what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America
p237
aVand not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.
p238
aVBut, today in Britain, for example,
p239
aVIndian restaurants in Britain
p240
aVemploy more people than the coal mining,
p241
aVship building and iron and steel industries combined.
p242
aVSo the empire can strike back.
p243
aV(Applause)
p244
aa(lp245
VBut, with this increasing awareness of India,
p246
aVwith you and with I, and so on,
p247
aVwith tales like Afghanistan,
p248
aVcomes something vital in the information era,
p249
aVthe sense that in today's world
p250
aVit's not the side of the bigger army that wins,
p251
aVit's the country that tells a better story that prevails.
p252
aVAnd India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.
p253
aVStereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.
p254
aVas a student in the mid '70s,
p255
aVI knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.
p256
aa(lp257
VToday, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere
p258
aVspeak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology
p259
aVwith the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.
p260
aVThis can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.
p261
aVI had a friend, a history major like me,
p262
aVwho was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,
p263
aVby an anxiously perspiring European saying,
p264
aV"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?"
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VWe've gone from the image of India as
p268
aVland of fakirs lying on beds of nails,
p269
aVand snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,
p270
aVto the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,
p271
aVcomputer wizards, software gurus.
p272
aVBut that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.
p273
aVBut, there is something more substantive to that.
p274
aVThe story rests on a fundamental platform
p275
aVof political pluralism.
p276
aVIt's a civilizational story to begin with.
p277
aVBecause India has been an open society for millennia.
p278
aVIndia gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple
p279
aVby the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.
p280
aa(lp281
VIn fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,
p282
aVlanded on the shores of Kerala, my home state,
p283
aVsomewhere around 52 A.D.,
p284
aVhe was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.
p285
aVAnd to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora
p286
aVin the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered
p287
aVa single incident of anti-semitism.
p288
aV(Applause)
p289
aVThat's the Indian story.
p290
aVIslam came peacefully to the south,
p291
aVslightly more differently complicated history in the north.
p292
aVBut all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.
p293
aa(lp294
VYou know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,
p295
aVthe biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.
p296
aVAnd the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population
p297
aVkeeps growing by 20 million a year.
p298
aVBut, the fact is
p299
aVthat the last elections, five years ago,
p300
aVgave the world extraordinary phenomenon
p301
aVof an election being won by a woman political leader
p302
aVof Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,
p303
aVwho then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,
p304
aVto be sworn in as Prime Minister
p305
aVby a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,
p306
aVin a country 81 percent Hindu.
p307
aV(Applause)
p308
aa(lp309
VThis is India, and of course it's all the more striking
p310
aVbecause it was four years later that we all applauded
p311
aVthe U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,
p312
aVmore than 220 years of free and fair elections,
p313
aVwhich took till last year to elect a president or a vice president
p314
aVwho wasn't white, male or Christian.
p315
aVSo, maybe \u2014 oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon \u2014
p316
aVand he is male, but he isn't white.
p317
aVAll the others have been all those three.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVAll his predecessors have been all those three,
p320
aVand that's the point I was trying to make.
p321
aV(Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VBut, the issue is
p324
aVthat when I talked about that example,
p325
aVit's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.
p326
aVBecause ultimately, that electoral outcome
p327
aVhad nothing to do with the rest of the world.
p328
aVIt was essentially India being itself.
p329
aVAnd ultimately, it seems to me,
p330
aVthat always works better than propaganda.
p331
aVGovernments aren't very good at telling stories.
p332
aVBut people see a society for what it is,
p333
aVand that, it seems to me, is what ultimately
p334
aVwill make a difference in today's information era,
p335
aVin today's TED age.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo India now is no longer
p338
aVthe nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,
p339
aVbecause we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,
p340
aVwe've every religion know to mankind,
p341
aVwith the possible exception of Shintoism,
p342
aVthough that has some Hindu elements somewhere.
p343
aVWe have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.
p344
aVAnd those of you who cashed your money here
p345
aVmight be surprised to see how many scripts there are
p346
aVon the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.
p347
aVWe've got all of that.
p348
aVWe don't even have geography uniting us,
p349
aVbecause the natural geography of the subcontinent
p350
aVframed by the mountains and the sea was hacked
p351
aVby the partition with Pakistan in 1947.
p352
aVIn fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,
p353
aVbecause the name "India" comes from the river Indus,
p354
aVwhich flows in Pakistan.
p355
aa(lp356
VBut, the whole point is that India
p357
aVis the nationalism of an idea.
p358
aVIt's the idea of an ever-ever-land,
p359
aVemerging from an ancient civilization,
p360
aVunited by a shared history,
p361
aVbut sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.
p362
aVThat is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.
p363
aVAnd it's the nationalism of an idea that
p364
aVessentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,
p365
aVcolor, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,
p366
aVand still rally around a consensus.
p367
aVAnd the consensus is of a very simple principle,
p368
aVthat in a diverse plural democracy like India
p369
aVyou don't really have to agree on everything all the time,
p370
aVso long as you agree on the ground rules
p371
aVof how you will disagree.
p372
aVThe great success story of India,
p373
aVa country that so many learned scholars and journalists
p374
aVassumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,
p375
aVis that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.
p376
aa(lp377
VNow, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.
p378
aVAnd I do want to make the point
p379
aVthat if there is anything worth celebrating about India,
p380
aVit isn't military muscle, economic power.
p381
aVAll of that is necessary,
p382
aVbut we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.
p383
aVSomebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.
p384
aVWe can't really be both of those.
p385
aVWe have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the
p386
aVhardware of development,
p387
aVthe ports, the roads, the airports,
p388
aVall the infrastructural things we need to do,
p389
aVand the software of development,
p390
aVthe human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India
p391
aVto be able to have a couple of square meals a day,
p392
aVto be able to send his or her children
p393
aVto a decent school,
p394
aVand to aspire to work a job
p395
aVthat will give them opportunities in their lives
p396
aVthat can transform themselves.
p397
aa(lp398
VBut, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,
p399
aVthose real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.
p400
aVBut, it's all taking place in an open society,
p401
aVin a rich and diverse and plural civilization,
p402
aVin one that is determined to liberate and fulfill
p403
aVthe creative energies of its people.
p404
aVThat's why India belongs at TED,
p405
aVand that's why TED belongs in India.
p406
aVThank you very much.

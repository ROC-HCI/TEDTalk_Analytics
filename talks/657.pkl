VI'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.
p5
aVAnd by that, I mean
p6
aVthat I develop robots that are characters,
p7
aVbut also robots that will eventually
p8
aVcome to empathize with you.
p9
aVSo we're starting with a variety of technologies
p10
aVthat have converged into these conversational character robots
p11
aVthat can see faces, make eye contact with you,
p12
aVmake a full range of facial expressions, understand speech
p13
aVand begin to model how you're feeling
p14
aVand who you are, and build a relationship with you.
p15
aa(lp16
VI developed a series of technologies
p17
aVthat allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions
p18
aVthan previously achieved, on lower power,
p19
aVwhich enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.
p20
aVSo, it's a full range of facial expressions
p21
aVsimulating all the major muscles in the human face,
p22
aVrunning on very small batteries,
p23
aVextremely lightweight.
p24
aa(lp25
VThe materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions
p26
aVis a material that we call Frubber,
p27
aVand it actually has three major innovations
p28
aVin the material that allow this to happen.
p29
aVOne is hierarchical pores,
p30
aVand the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.
p31
aa(lp32
VThere he's starting to walk.
p33
aVThis is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
p34
aVI built the head. They built the body.
p35
aVSo the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines,
p36
aVand not just sentience, but empathy.
p37
aa(lp38
VWe're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory
p39
aVat the U.C. San Diego.
p40
aVThey have this really remarkable facial expression technology
p41
aVthat recognizes facial expressions,
p42
aVwhat facial expressions you're making.
p43
aVIt also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation.
p44
aVWe're emulating all the major facial expressions,
p45
aVand then controlling it with the software
p46
aVthat we call the Character Engine.
p47
aVAnd here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.
p48
aa(lp49
VIn fact, right now \u2014 plug it from here, and then plug it in here,
p50
aVand now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.
p51
aVOkay. So I'm smiling.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVNow I'm frowning.
p54
aVAnd this is really heavily backlit.
p55
aVOkay, here we go.
p56
aVOh, it's so sad.
p57
aVOkay, so you smile, frowning.
p58
aVSo his perception of your emotional states
p59
aVis very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.
p60
aa(lp61
VMachines are becoming devastatingly capable
p62
aVof things like killing. Right?
p63
aVThose machines have no place for empathy.
p64
aVAnd there is billions of dollars being spent on that.
p65
aVCharacter robotics could plant the seed
p66
aVfor robots that actually have empathy.
p67
aVSo, if they achieve human level intelligence
p68
aVor, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence,
p69
aVthis could be the seeds of hope for our future.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D.
p72
aVAnd then I started Hanson Robotics,
p73
aVwhich has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.
p74
aVThis is one of our robots
p75
aVthat we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.
p76
aVAnd it sees multiple people in a scene,
p77
aVremembers where individual people are,
p78
aVand looks from person to person, remembering people.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo, we're involving two things.
p81
aVOne, the perception of people,
p82
aVand two, the natural interface,
p83
aVthe natural form of the interface,
p84
aVso that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.
p85
aVYou start to believe that it's alive and aware.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together
p88
aVin an artistic display of an android portrait
p89
aVof science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick,
p90
aVwho wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
p91
aVwhich was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."
p92
aVIn these stories, robots often think
p93
aVthat they're human, and they sort of come to life.
p94
aVSo we put his writings, letters,
p95
aVhis interviews, correspondences,
p96
aVinto a huge database of thousands of pages,
p97
aVand then used some natural language processing
p98
aVto allow you to actually have a conversation with him.
p99
aVAnd it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things
p100
aVthat just sounded like they really understood you.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing,
p103
aVwhich is a little character that's a spokesbot
p104
aVfor friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.
p105
aVAnd we're getting this mass-manufactured.
p106
aVWe specked it out to actually be doable
p107
aVwith a very, very low-cost bill of materials,
p108
aVso that it can become a childhood companion for kids.
p109
aVInterfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.
p110
aVAs artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.
p111
aa(lp112
VChris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's incredible.
p113
aV(Applause)

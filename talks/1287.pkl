VSo that's Johnny Depp, of course.
p5
aVAnd that's Johnny Depp's shoulder.
p6
aVAnd that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo.
p7
aVSome of you might know that, in 1990,
p8
aVDepp got engaged to Winona Ryder,
p9
aVand he had tattooed on his right shoulder
p10
aV"Winona forever."
p11
aVAnd then three years later \u2014
p12
aVwhich in fairness, kind of is forever by Hollywood standards \u2014
p13
aVthey broke up,
p14
aVand Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done.
p15
aVAnd now his shoulder says, "Wino forever."
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VSo like Johnny Depp,
p20
aVand like 25 percent of Americans
p21
aVbetween the ages of 16 and 50,
p22
aVI have a tattoo.
p23
aVI first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s,
p24
aVbut I deliberately waited a really long time.
p25
aVBecause we all know people
p26
aVwho have gotten tattoos when they were 17
p27
aVor 19 or 23
p28
aVand regretted it by the time they were 30.
p29
aVThat didn't happen to me.
p30
aVI got my tattoo when I was 29,
p31
aVand I regretted it instantly.
p32
aVAnd by "regretted it,"
p33
aVI mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place \u2014
p34
aVthis is just a couple miles from here
p35
aVdown on the Lower East Side \u2014
p36
aVand I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight
p37
aVon the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVWhich is a great place to do it because nobody cares.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVAnd then I went home that night, and I had an even larger emotional meltdown,
p42
aVwhich I'll say more about in a minute.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd this was all actually quite shocking to me,
p45
aVbecause prior to this moment,
p46
aVI had prided myself
p47
aVon having absolutely no regrets.
p48
aVI made a lot of mistakes
p49
aVand dumb decisions, of course.
p50
aVI do that hourly.
p51
aVBut I had always felt like, look, you know,
p52
aVI made the best choice I could make
p53
aVgiven who I was then,
p54
aVgiven the information I had on hand.
p55
aVI learned a lesson from it.
p56
aVIt somehow got me to where I am in life right now.
p57
aVAnd okay, I wouldn't change it.
p58
aVIn other words, I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret,
p59
aVwhich is that lamenting things that occurred in the past
p60
aVis an absolute waste of time,
p61
aVthat we should always look forward and not backward,
p62
aVand that one of the noblest and best things we can do
p63
aVis strive to live a life free of regrets.
p64
aa(lp65
VThis idea is nicely captured by this quote:
p66
aV"Things without all remedy
p67
aVshould be without regard;
p68
aVwhat's done is done."
p69
aVAnd it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first \u2014
p70
aVsomething we might all agree to sign onto ...
p71
aVuntil I tell you who said it.
p72
aVRight, so this is Lady MacBeth
p73
aVbasically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss
p74
aVfor feeling bad about murdering people.
p75
aVAnd as it happens, Shakespeare was onto something here,
p76
aVas he generally was.
p77
aVBecause the inability to experience regret
p78
aVis actually one of the diagnostic characteristics
p79
aVof sociopaths.
p80
aVIt's also, by the way, a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage.
p81
aVSo people who have damage
p82
aVto their orbital frontal cortex
p83
aVseem to be unable to feel regret
p84
aVin the face of even obviously very poor decisions.
p85
aVSo if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret,
p86
aVthere is an option open to you.
p87
aVIt's called a lobotomy.
p88
aVBut if you want to be fully functional
p89
aVand fully human
p90
aVand fully humane,
p91
aVI think you need to learn to live, not without regret, but with it.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo let's start off by defining some terms.
p94
aVWhat is regret?
p95
aVRegret is the emotion we experience
p96
aVwhen we think that our present situation
p97
aVcould be better or happier
p98
aVif we had done something different in the past.
p99
aVSo in other words, regret requires two things.
p100
aVIt requires, first of all, agency \u2014 we had to make a decision in the first place.
p101
aVAnd second of all, it requires imagination.
p102
aVWe need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice,
p103
aVand then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward
p104
aVand imagine how things would be playing out in our present.
p105
aVAnd in fact, the more we have of either of these things \u2014
p106
aVthe more agency and the more imagination
p107
aVwith respect to a given regret,
p108
aVthe more acute that regret will be.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo let's say for instance
p111
aVthat you're on your way to your best friend's wedding
p112
aVand you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic,
p113
aVand you finally arrive at your gate
p114
aVand you've missed your flight.
p115
aVYou're going to experience more regret in that situation
p116
aVif you missed your flight by three minutes
p117
aVthan if you missed it by 20.
p118
aVWhy?
p119
aVWell because, if you miss your flight by three minutes,
p120
aVit is painfully easy to imagine
p121
aVthat you could have made different decisions
p122
aVthat would have led to a better outcome.
p123
aV"I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel.
p124
aVI should have gone through that yellow light."
p125
aVThese are the classic conditions that create regret.
p126
aVWe feel regret when we think we are responsible
p127
aVfor a decision that came out badly,
p128
aVbut almost came out well.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow within that framework,
p131
aVwe can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things.
p132
aVThis session today is about behavioral economics.
p133
aVAnd most of what we know about regret
p134
aVcomes to us out of that domain.
p135
aVWe have a vast body of literature
p136
aVon consumer and financial decisions
p137
aVand the regrets associated with them \u2014
p138
aVbuyer's remorse, basically.
p139
aVBut then finally, it occurred to some researchers to step back
p140
aVand say, well okay, but overall,
p141
aVwhat do we regret most in life?
p142
aVHere's what the answers turn out to look like.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo top six regrets \u2014
p145
aVthe things we regret most in life:
p146
aVNumber one by far, education.
p147
aV33 percent of all of our regrets
p148
aVpertain to decisions we made about education.
p149
aVWe wish we'd gotten more of it.
p150
aVWe wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have.
p151
aVWe wish we'd chosen to study a different topic.
p152
aVOthers very high on our list of regrets
p153
aVinclude career, romance, parenting,
p154
aVvarious decisions and choices about our sense of self
p155
aVand how we spend our leisure time \u2014
p156
aVor actually more specifically,
p157
aVhow we fail to spend our leisure time.
p158
aVThe remaining regrets
p159
aVpertain to these things:
p160
aVfinance, family issues unrelated to romance or parenting,
p161
aVhealth, friends,
p162
aVspirituality and community.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo in other words, we know most of what we know about regret
p165
aVby the study of finance.
p166
aVBut it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life,
p167
aVyou know what, our financial decisions don't even rank.
p168
aVThey account for less than three percent of our total regrets.
p169
aVSo if you're sitting there stressing
p170
aVabout large cap versus small cap,
p171
aVor company A versus company B,
p172
aVor should you buy the Subaru or the Prius,
p173
aVyou know what, let it go.
p174
aVOdds are, you're not going to care in five years.
p175
aa(lp176
VBut for these things that we actually do really care about
p177
aVand do experience profound regret around,
p178
aVwhat does that experience feel like?
p179
aVWe all know the short answer.
p180
aVIt feels terrible. Regret feels awful.
p181
aVBut it turns out that regret feels awful
p182
aVin four very specific and consistent ways.
p183
aVSo the first consistent component of regret
p184
aVis basically denial.
p185
aVWhen I went home that night after getting my tattoo,
p186
aVI basically stayed up all night.
p187
aVAnd for the first several hours,
p188
aVthere was exactly one thought in my head.
p189
aVAnd the thought was,
p190
aV"Make it go away!"
p191
aVThis is an unbelievably primitive emotional response.
p192
aVI mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!"
p193
aVWe're not trying to solve the problem.
p194
aVWe're not trying to understand how the problem came about.
p195
aVWe just want it to vanish.
p196
aa(lp197
VThe second characteristic component of regret
p198
aVis a sense of bewilderment.
p199
aVSo the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night
p200
aVwas, "How could I have done that?
p201
aVWhat was I thinking?"
p202
aVThis real sense of alienation
p203
aVfrom the part of us that made a decision we regret.
p204
aVWe can't identify with that part.
p205
aVWe don't understand that part.
p206
aVAnd we certainly don't have any empathy for that part \u2014
p207
aVwhich explains the third consistent component of regret,
p208
aVwhich is an intense desire to punish ourselves.
p209
aVThat's why, in the face of our regret,
p210
aVthe thing we consistently say is, "I could have kicked myself."
p211
aVThe fourth component here
p212
aVis that regret is what psychologists call perseverative.
p213
aVTo perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly
p214
aVon the exact same thing.
p215
aVNow the effect of perseveration
p216
aVis to basically take these first three components of regret
p217
aVand put them on an infinite loop.
p218
aVSo it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night,
p219
aVthinking, "Make it go away."
p220
aVIt's that I sat there and I thought,
p221
aV"Make it go away. Make it go away.
p222
aVMake it go away. Make it go away."
p223
aVSo if you look at the psychological literature,
p224
aVthese are the four consistent defining components of regret.
p225
aa(lp226
VBut I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one.
p227
aVAnd I think of this
p228
aVas a kind of existential wake-up call.
p229
aVThat night in my apartment,
p230
aVafter I got done kicking myself and so forth,
p231
aVI lay in bed for a long time,
p232
aVand I thought about skin grafts.
p233
aVAnd then I thought about how,
p234
aVmuch as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God,
p235
aVprobably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy.
p236
aVIn point of fact, no insurance covers acts of idiocy.
p237
aVThe whole point of acts of idiocy
p238
aVis that they leave you totally uninsured;
p239
aVthey leave you exposed to the world
p240
aVand exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility
p241
aVin face of, frankly, a fairly indifferent universe.
p242
aa(lp243
VThis is obviously an incredibly painful experience.
p244
aVAnd I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West
p245
aVin the grips of what I sometimes think of
p246
aVas a Control-Z culture \u2014
p247
aVControl-Z like the computer command,
p248
aVundo.
p249
aVWe're incredibly used to not having to face
p250
aVlife's hard realities, in a certain sense.
p251
aVWe think we can throw money at the problem
p252
aVor throw technology at the problem \u2014
p253
aVwe can undo and unfriend
p254
aVand unfollow.
p255
aVAnd the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life
p256
aVthat we desperately want to change
p257
aVand we cannot.
p258
aVSometimes instead of Control-Z,
p259
aVwe actually have zero control.
p260
aVAnd for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists \u2014
p261
aVand I know where of I speak \u2014
p262
aVthis is really hard,
p263
aVbecause we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right.
p264
aa(lp265
VNow there is a case to be made
p266
aVthat control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos,
p267
aVand I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes.
p268
aVBut first I want to say
p269
aVthat the intensity and persistence
p270
aVwith which we experience these emotional components of regret
p271
aVis obviously going to vary
p272
aVdepending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about.
p273
aVSo for instance, here's one of my favorite
p274
aVautomatic generators of regret in modern life.
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aVText: Relpy to all.
p277
aVAnd the amazing thing
p278
aVabout this really insidious technological innovation
p279
aVis that even just with this one thing,
p280
aVwe can experience a huge range of regret.
p281
aVYou can accidentally hit "reply all" to an email
p282
aVand torpedo a relationship.
p283
aVOr you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work.
p284
aVOr you can have your last day at work.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd this doesn't even touch
p287
aVon the really profound regrets of a life.
p288
aVBecause of course, sometimes we do make decisions
p289
aVthat have irrevocable and terrible consequences,
p290
aVeither for our own or for other people's
p291
aVhealth and happiness and livelihoods,
p292
aVand in the very worst case scenario, even their lives.
p293
aVNow obviously, those kinds of regrets
p294
aVare incredibly piercing and enduring.
p295
aVI mean, even the stupid "reply all" regrets
p296
aVcan leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo how are we supposed to live with this?
p299
aVI want to suggest that there's three things
p300
aVthat help us to make our peace with regret.
p301
aVAnd the first of these
p302
aVis to take some comfort in its universality.
p303
aVIf you Google regret and tattoo,
p304
aVyou will get 11.5 million hits.
p305
aV(Laughter)
p306
aVThe FDA estimates
p307
aVthat of all the Americans who have tattoos,
p308
aV17 percent of us regret getting them.
p309
aVThat is Johnny Depp and me
p310
aVand our seven million friends.
p311
aVAnd that's just regret about tattoos.
p312
aVWe are all in this together.
p313
aa(lp314
VThe second way that we can help make our peace with regret
p315
aVis to laugh at ourselves.
p316
aVNow in my case, this really wasn't a problem,
p317
aVbecause it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself
p318
aVwhen you're 29 years old and you want your mommy
p319
aVbecause you don't like your new tattoo.
p320
aVBut it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion
p321
aVwhen it comes to these more profound regrets.
p322
aVI don't think that's the case though.
p323
aVAll of us who've experienced regret
p324
aVthat contains real pain and real grief
p325
aVunderstand that humor and even black humor
p326
aVplays a crucial role in helping us survive.
p327
aVIt connects the poles of our lives back together,
p328
aVthe positive and the negative,
p329
aVand it sends a little current of life back into us.
p330
aa(lp331
VThe third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret
p332
aVis through the passage of time,
p333
aVwhich, as we know, heals all wounds \u2014
p334
aVexcept for tattoos, which are permanent.
p335
aVSo it's been several years
p336
aVsince I got my own tattoo.
p337
aVAnd do you guys just want to see it?
p338
aVAll right.
p339
aVActually, you know what, I should warn you,
p340
aVyou're going to be disappointed.
p341
aVBecause it's actually not that hideous.
p342
aVI didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face
p343
aVon some indiscreet part of myself or something.
p344
aVWhen other people see my tattoo,
p345
aVfor the most part they like how it looks.
p346
aVIt's just that I don't like how it looks.
p347
aVAnd as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist.
p348
aVBut I'll let you see it anyway.
p349
aa(lp350
VThis is my tattoo.
p351
aVI can guess what some of you are thinking.
p352
aVSo let me reassure you about something.
p353
aVSome of your own regrets
p354
aVare also not as ugly as you think they are.
p355
aVI got this tattoo
p356
aVbecause I spent most of my 20s
p357
aVliving outside the country and traveling.
p358
aVAnd when I came and settled in New York afterward,
p359
aVI was worried that I would forget
p360
aVsome of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.
p361
aVSpecifically the two things I learned about myself
p362
aVthat I most didn't want to forget
p363
aVwas how important it felt to keep exploring
p364
aVand, simultaneously, how important it is
p365
aVto somehow keep an eye on your own true north.
p366
aVAnd what I loved about this image of the compass
p367
aVwas that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas
p368
aVin one simple image.
p369
aVAnd I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device.
p370
aa(lp371
VWell it did.
p372
aVBut it turns out, it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would;
p373
aVit reminds me constantly of something else instead.
p374
aVIt actually reminds me
p375
aVof the most important lesson regret can teach us,
p376
aVwhich is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us.
p377
aVAnd ironically, I think it's probably the single most important thing
p378
aVI possibly could have tattooed onto my body \u2014
p379
aVpartly as a writer,
p380
aVbut also just as a human being.
p381
aVHere's the thing,
p382
aVif we have goals
p383
aVand dreams,
p384
aVand we want to do our best,
p385
aVand if we love people
p386
aVand we don't want to hurt them or lose them,
p387
aVwe should feel pain when things go wrong.
p388
aVThe point isn't to live without any regrets.
p389
aVThe point is to not hate ourselves for having them.
p390
aa(lp391
VThe lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo
p392
aVand that I want to leave you with today
p393
aVis this:
p394
aVWe need to learn to love
p395
aVthe flawed, imperfect things
p396
aVthat we create
p397
aVand to forgive ourselves for creating them.
p398
aVRegret doesn't remind us that we did badly.
p399
aVIt reminds us that we know we can do better.
p400
aa(lp401
VThank you.

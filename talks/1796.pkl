VFrancesca Fedeli: Ciao.
p5
aVSo he's Mario. He's our son.
p6
aVHe was born two and a half years ago,
p7
aVand I had a pretty tough pregnancy
p8
aVbecause I had to stay still in a bed for, like, eight months.
p9
aVBut in the end everything seemed to be under control.
p10
aVSo he got the right weight at birth.
p11
aVHe got the right Apgar index.
p12
aVSo we were pretty reassured by this.
p13
aVBut at the end, 10 days later after he was born,
p14
aVwe discovered that he had a stroke.
p15
aVAs you might know,
p16
aVa stroke is a brain injury.
p17
aVA perinatal stroke could be something
p18
aVthat can happen during the nine months of pregnancy
p19
aVor just suddenly after the birth,
p20
aVand in his case, as you can see,
p21
aVthe right part of his brain has gone.
p22
aVSo the effect that this stroke could have on Mario's body
p23
aVcould be the fact that he couldn't be able to control
p24
aVthe left side of his body.
p25
aVJust imagine, if you have a computer and a printer
p26
aVand you want to transmit, to input to print out a document,
p27
aVbut the printer doesn't have the right drives,
p28
aVso the same is for Mario.
p29
aVIt's just like, he would like to move his left side
p30
aVof his body, but he's not able to transmit the right input
p31
aVto move his left arm and left leg.
p32
aVSo life had to change.
p33
aVWe needed to change our schedule.
p34
aVWe needed to change the impact that this birth had
p35
aVon our life.
p36
aVRoberto D'Angelo: As you may imagine,
p37
aVunfortunately, we were not ready.
p38
aVNobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities,
p39
aVand as many questions as possible started
p40
aVto come to our minds.
p41
aVAnd that has been really a tough time.
p42
aVQuestions, some basics, like, you know,
p43
aVwhy did this happen to us?
p44
aVAnd what went wrong?
p45
aVSome more tough, like, really,
p46
aVwhat will be the impact on Mario's life?
p47
aVI mean, at the end, will he be able to work?
p48
aVWill he be able to be normal?
p49
aVAnd, you know, as a parent, especially for the first time,
p50
aVwhy is he not going to be better than us?
p51
aVAnd this, indeed, really is tough to say,
p52
aVbut a few months later, we realized that
p53
aVwe were really feeling like a failure.
p54
aVI mean, the only real product of our life,
p55
aVat the end, was a failure.
p56
aVAnd you know, it was not a failure for ourselves in itself,
p57
aVbut it was a failure that will impact his full life.
p58
aVHonestly, we went down.
p59
aVI mean we went really down, but at the end,
p60
aVwe started to look at him,
p61
aVand we said, we have to react.
p62
aVSo immediately, as Francesca said, we changed our life.
p63
aVWe started physiotherapy, we started the rehabilitation,
p64
aVand one of the paths that we were following
p65
aVin terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot.
p66
aVBasically, we spent months doing this with Mario.
p67
aVYou have an object, and we showed him
p68
aVhow to grab the object.
p69
aVNow, the theory of mirror neurons simply says
p70
aVthat in your brains, exactly now, as you watch me doing this,
p71
aVyou are activating exactly the same neurons
p72
aVas if you do the actions.
p73
aVIt looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation.
p74
aVBut one day we found that Mario
p75
aVwas not looking at our hand.
p76
aVHe was looking at us.
p77
aVWe were his mirror.
p78
aVAnd the problem, as you might feel,
p79
aVis that we were down, we were depressed,
p80
aVwe were looking at him as a problem,
p81
aVnot as a son, not from a positive perspective.
p82
aVAnd that day really changed our perspective.
p83
aVWe realized that we had to become
p84
aVa better mirror for Mario.
p85
aVWe restarted from our strengths,
p86
aVand at the same time we restarted from his strengths.
p87
aVWe stopped looking at him as a problem,
p88
aVand we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve.
p89
aVAnd really, this was the change,
p90
aVand from our side, we said,
p91
aV"What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario?"
p92
aVAnd we started from our passions.
p93
aVI mean, at the end, my wife and myself
p94
aVare quite different,
p95
aVbut we have many things in common.
p96
aVWe love to travel, we love music,
p97
aVwe love to be in places like this,
p98
aVand we started to bring Mario with us
p99
aVjust to show to him the best things that we can show to him.
p100
aVThis short video is from last week.
p101
aVI am not saying \u2014
p102
aV(Applause) \u2014
p103
aVI am not saying it's a miracle. That's not the message,
p104
aVbecause we are just at the beginning of the path.
p105
aVBut we want to share what was the key learning,
p106
aVthe key learning that Mario drove to us,
p107
aVand it is to consider what you have as a gift
p108
aVand not only what you miss,
p109
aVand to consider what you miss just as an opportunity.
p110
aVAnd this is the message that we want to share with you.
p111
aVThis is why we are here.
p112
aVMario!
p113
aVAnd this is why \u2014
p114
aV(Applause) \u2014
p115
aVAnd this is why
p116
aVwe decided to share the best mirror in the world with him.
p117
aVAnd we thank you so much, all of you.
p118
aVFF: Thank you. RD: Thank you. Bye.
p119
aV(Applause)
p120
aVFF: Thank you. (Applause)

body. Through mirror neuron rehabilitation, Mario is now 5 years old and has greatly improved motion.</p><p>The tech-savvy couple founded FightTheStroke.org to gather and share the experiences of families who have been affected by all types of infant and childhood strokes. The social movement wants to open up a dialogue about the devastating effects of this traumatic event, advocating for young stroke survivors and using technology and open medicine as enablers for their better future. Together, as a family, they&rsquo;re promoting the awareness of this story as motivational speakers at events like TED, they&#39;re proud ambassaros of TEDMED in Italy and promoters of the first Medicine Hackathon in Italy, aimed to regroup the leading experts on Medicine and Innovation.

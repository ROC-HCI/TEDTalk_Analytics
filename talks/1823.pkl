VEric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist,
p5
aVand we both study complex networks.
p6
aVAnd we met a couple years ago when we discovered
p7
aVthat we had both given a short TED Talk
p8
aVabout the ecology of war,
p9
aVand we realized that we were connected
p10
aVby the ideas we shared before we ever met.
p11
aVAnd then we thought, you know, there are thousands
p12
aVof other talks out there, especially TEDx Talks,
p13
aVthat are popping up all over the world.
p14
aVHow are they connected,
p15
aVand what does that global conversation look like?
p16
aVSo Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that.
p17
aa(lp18
VSean Gourley: Exactly. So we took 24,000 TEDx Talks
p19
aVfrom around the world, 147 different countries,
p20
aVand we took these talks and we wanted to find
p21
aVthe mathematical structures that underly
p22
aVthe ideas behind them.
p23
aVAnd we wanted to do that so we could see how
p24
aVthey connected with each other.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd so, of course, if you're going to do this kind of stuff,
p27
aVyou need a lot of data.
p28
aVSo the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube,
p29
aVand we can go down and basically pull
p30
aVall the open information from YouTube,
p31
aVall the comments, all the views, who's watching it,
p32
aVwhere are they watching it, what are they saying in the comments.
p33
aVBut we can also pull up, using speech-to-text translation,
p34
aVwe can pull the entire transcript,
p35
aVand that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself.
p36
aVSo we can take their transcript
p37
aVand actually do some pretty cool things.
p38
aVWe can take natural language processing algorithms
p39
aVto kind of read through with a computer, line by line,
p40
aVextracting key concepts from this.
p41
aVAnd we take those key concepts and they sort of form
p42
aVthis mathematical structure of an idea.
p43
aVAnd we call that the meme-ome.
p44
aVAnd the meme-ome, you know, quite simply,
p45
aVis the mathematics that underlies an idea,
p46
aVand we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it,
p47
aVwhich I want to share with you now.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo each idea has its own meme-ome,
p50
aVand each idea is unique with that,
p51
aVbut of course, ideas, they borrow from each other,
p52
aVthey kind of steal sometimes,
p53
aVand they certainly build on each other,
p54
aVand we can go through mathematically
p55
aVand take the meme-ome from one talk
p56
aVand compare it to the meme-ome from every other talk,
p57
aVand if there's a similarity between the two of them,
p58
aVwe can create a link and represent that as a graph,
p59
aVjust like Eric and I are connected.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo that's theory, that's great.
p62
aVLet's see how it works in actual practice.
p63
aVSo what we've got here now is the global footprint
p64
aVof all the TEDx Talks over the last four years
p65
aVexploding out around the world
p66
aVfrom New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner.
p67
aVAnd what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these,
p68
aVand we started to see where the connections occurred,
p69
aVwhere they connected with each other.
p70
aVCameron Russell talking about image and beauty
p71
aVconnected over into Europe.
p72
aVWe've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine
p73
aVradiating outwards from the Middle East.
p74
aVAnd we've got something a little broader
p75
aVlike big data with a truly global footprint
p76
aVreminiscent of a conversation
p77
aVthat is happening everywhere.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo from this, we kind of run up against the limits
p80
aVof what we can actually do with a geographic projection,
p81
aVbut luckily, computer technology allows us to go out
p82
aVinto multidimensional space.
p83
aVSo we can take in our network projection
p84
aVand apply a physics engine to this,
p85
aVand the similar talks kind of smash together,
p86
aVand the different ones fly apart,
p87
aVand what we're left with is something quite beautiful.
p88
aa(lp89
VEB: So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk,
p90
aVthey're linked if they share similar ideas,
p91
aVand that comes from a machine reading
p92
aVof entire talk transcripts,
p93
aVand then all these topics that pop out,
p94
aVthey're not from tags and keywords.
p95
aVThey come from the network structure
p96
aVof interconnected ideas. Keep going.
p97
aa(lp98
VSG: Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that,
p99
aVbut he's going to slow me down.
p100
aVWe've got education connected to storytelling
p101
aVtriangulated next to social media.
p102
aVYou've got, of course, the human brain right next to healthcare,
p103
aVwhich you might expect,
p104
aVbut also you've got video games, which is sort of adjacent,
p105
aVas those two spaces interface with each other.
p106
aa(lp107
VBut I want to take you into one cluster
p108
aVthat's particularly important to me, and that's the environment.
p109
aVAnd I want to kind of zoom in on that
p110
aVand see if we can get a little more resolution.
p111
aVSo as we go in here, what we start to see,
p112
aVapply the physics engine again,
p113
aVwe see what's one conversation
p114
aVis actually composed of many smaller ones.
p115
aVThe structure starts to emerge
p116
aVwhere we see a kind of fractal behavior
p117
aVof the words and the language that we use
p118
aVto describe the things that are important to us
p119
aVall around this world.
p120
aVSo you've got food economy and local food at the top,
p121
aVyou've got greenhouse gases, solar and nuclear waste.
p122
aVWhat you're getting is a range of smaller conversations,
p123
aVeach connected to each other through the ideas
p124
aVand the language they share,
p125
aVcreating a broader concept of the environment.
p126
aVAnd of course, from here, we can go
p127
aVand zoom in and see, well, what are young people looking at?
p128
aVAnd they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion.
p129
aVThis is their kind of resonance
p130
aVfor the conversation around the environment.
p131
aVIf we split along gender lines,
p132
aVwe can see females resonating heavily
p133
aVwith food economy, but also out there in hope and optimism.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here,
p136
aVand I'll throw to Eric for the next part.
p137
aa(lp138
VEB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here,
p139
aVyou cannot get this kind of perspective
p140
aVfrom a simple tag search on YouTube.
p141
aVLet's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation
p142
aVout of environment, and look at all the talks together.
p143
aVNow often, when we're faced with this amount of content,
p144
aVwe do a couple of things to simplify it.
p145
aVWe might just say, well,
p146
aVwhat are the most popular talks out there?
p147
aVAnd a few rise to the surface.
p148
aVThere's a talk about gratitude.
p149
aVThere's another one about personal health and nutrition.
p150
aVAnd of course, there's got to be one about porn, right?
p151
aVAnd so then we might say, well, gratitude, that was last year.
p152
aVWhat's trending now? What's the popular talk now?
p153
aVAnd we can see that the new, emerging, top trending topic
p154
aVis about digital privacy.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo this is great. It simplifies things.
p157
aVBut there's so much creative content
p158
aVthat's just buried at the bottom.
p159
aVAnd I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface
p160
aVthat's maybe really creative and interesting?
p161
aVWell, we can go back to the network structure of ideas
p162
aVto do that.
p163
aVRemember, it's that network structure
p164
aVthat is creating these emergent topics,
p165
aVand let's say we could take two of them,
p166
aVlike cities and genetics, and say, well, are there any talks
p167
aVthat creatively bridge these two really different disciplines.
p168
aVAnd that's \u2014 Essentially, this kind of creative remix
p169
aVis one of the hallmarks of innovation.
p170
aVWell here's one by Jessica Green
p171
aVabout the microbial ecology of buildings.
p172
aVIt's literally defining a new field.
p173
aVAnd we could go back to those topics and say, well,
p174
aVwhat talks are central to those conversations?
p175
aVIn the cities cluster, one of the most central
p176
aVwas one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities,
p177
aVand in the genetics cluster,
p178
aVwe have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter.
p179
aVThese are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline.
p180
aVWe could go the other direction and say, well,
p181
aVwhat are talks that are broadly synthesizing
p182
aVa lot of different kinds of fields.
p183
aVWe used a measure of ecological diversity to get this.
p184
aVLike, a talk by Steven Pinker on the history of violence,
p185
aVvery synthetic.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd then, of course, there are talks that are so unique
p188
aVthey're kind of out in the stratosphere, in their own special place,
p189
aVand we call that the Colleen Flanagan index.
p190
aVAnd if you don't know Colleen, she's an artist,
p191
aVand I asked her, "Well, what's it like out there
p192
aVin the stratosphere of our idea space?"
p193
aVAnd apparently it smells like bacon.
p194
aVI wouldn't know.
p195
aVSo we're using these network motifs
p196
aVto find talks that are unique,
p197
aVones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields,
p198
aVones that are central to their topic,
p199
aVand ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields.
p200
aVOkay? We never would have found those with our obsession
p201
aVwith what's trending now.
p202
aVAnd all of this comes from the architecture of complexity,
p203
aVor the patterns of how things are connected.
p204
aa(lp205
VSG: So that's exactly right.
p206
aVWe've got ourselves in a world
p207
aVthat's massively complex,
p208
aVand we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down
p209
aVso we can navigate through it.
p210
aVAnd those algorithms, whilst being kind of useful,
p211
aVare also very, very narrow, and we can do better than that,
p212
aVbecause we can realize that their complexity is not random.
p213
aVIt has mathematical structure,
p214
aVand we can use that mathematical structure
p215
aVto go and explore things like the world of ideas
p216
aVto see what's being said, to see what's not being said,
p217
aVand to be a little bit more human
p218
aVand, hopefully, a little smarter.
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you.

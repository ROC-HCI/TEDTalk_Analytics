V"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
p5
aVand Mourners to and fro
p6
aVkept treading \u2014 treading \u2014 till [it seemed]
p7
aVthat Sense was breaking through \u2014
p8
aVAnd when they all were seated,
p9
aVa Service, like a Drum \u2014
p10
aVkept beating \u2014 beating \u2014 till I [thought]
p11
aVmy Mind was going numb \u2014
p12
aVAnd then I heard them lift a Box and creak across my Soul
p13
aVwith those same Boots of Lead, again,
p14
aVthen Space \u2014 began to toll,
p15
aVAs [all] the Heavens were a Bell, and Being, [but] an Ear,
p16
aVand I, and Silence, some strange Race,
p17
aVwrecked, solitary, here \u2014
p18
aV[And] then a Plank in Reason, broke,
p19
aVand I fell down and down \u2014
p20
aVand hit a World, at every plunge,
p21
aVand Finished knowing \u2014 then \u2014"
p22
aa(lp23
VWe know depression through metaphors.
p24
aVEmily Dickinson was able to convey it in language,
p25
aVGoya in an image.
p26
aVHalf the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states.
p27
aa(lp28
VAs for me, I had always thought myself tough,
p29
aVone of the people who could survive
p30
aVif I'd been sent to a concentration camp.
p31
aa(lp32
VIn 1991, I had a series of losses.
p33
aVMy mother died,
p34
aVa relationship I'd been in ended,
p35
aVI moved back to the United States from some years abroad,
p36
aVand I got through all of those experiences intact.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut in 1994, three years later,
p39
aVI found myself losing interest in almost everything.
p40
aVI didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do,
p41
aVand I didn't know why.
p42
aVThe opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality.
p43
aVAnd it was vitality
p44
aVthat seemed to seep away from me in that moment.
p45
aVEverything there was to do seemed like too much work.
p46
aVI would come home
p47
aVand I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine,
p48
aVand instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends,
p49
aVI would think,
p50
aV"What a lot of people that is to have to call back."
p51
aVOr I would decide I should have lunch,
p52
aVand then I would think, but I'd have to get the food out
p53
aVand put it on a plate
p54
aVand cut it up and chew it and swallow it,
p55
aVand it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression
p58
aVis that you know it's ridiculous.
p59
aVYou know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it.
p60
aVYou know that most people manage
p61
aVto listen to their messages and eat lunch
p62
aVand organize themselves to take a shower
p63
aVand go out the front door
p64
aVand that it's not a big deal,
p65
aVand yet you are nonetheless in its grip
p66
aVand you are unable to figure out any way around it.
p67
aVAnd so I began to feel myself doing less
p68
aVand thinking less
p69
aVand feeling less.
p70
aVIt was a kind of nullity.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd then the anxiety set in.
p73
aVIf you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month,
p74
aVI would say, "As long I know it'll be over in November, I can do it."
p75
aVBut if you said to me,
p76
aV"You have to have acute anxiety for the next month,"
p77
aVI would rather slit my wrist than go through it.
p78
aVIt was the feeling all the time
p79
aVlike that feeling you have if you're walking
p80
aVand you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you,
p81
aVbut instead of lasting half a second, the way that does,
p82
aVit lasted for six months.
p83
aVIt's a sensation of being afraid all the time
p84
aVbut not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of.
p85
aVAnd it was at that point that I began to think
p86
aVthat it was just too painful to be alive,
p87
aVand that the only reason not to kill oneself
p88
aVwas so as not to hurt other people.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd finally one day, I woke up
p91
aVand I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke,
p92
aVbecause I lay in bed completely frozen,
p93
aVlooking at the telephone, thinking,
p94
aV"Something is wrong and I should call for help,"
p95
aVand I couldn't reach out my arm
p96
aVand pick up the phone and dial.
p97
aVAnd finally, after four full hours of my lying and staring at it,
p98
aVthe phone rang,
p99
aVand somehow I managed to pick it up,
p100
aVand it was my father, and I said,
p101
aV"I'm in serious trouble. We need to do something."
p102
aa(lp103
VThe next day I started with the medications and the therapy.
p104
aVAnd I also started reckoning with this terrible question:
p105
aVIf I'm not the tough person
p106
aVwho could have made it through a concentration camp,
p107
aVthen who am I?
p108
aVAnd if I have to take medication,
p109
aVis that medication making me more fully myself,
p110
aVor is it making me someone else?
p111
aVAnd how do I feel about it if it's making me someone else?
p112
aa(lp113
VI had two advantages as I went into the fight.
p114
aVThe first is that I knew that, objectively speaking,
p115
aVI had a nice life,
p116
aVand that if I could only get well,
p117
aVthere was something at the other end that was worth living for.
p118
aVAnd the other was that I had access to good treatment.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut I nonetheless emerged and relapsed,
p121
aVand emerged and relapsed,
p122
aVand emerged and relapsed,
p123
aVand finally understood
p124
aVI would have to be on medication and in therapy forever.
p125
aVAnd I thought,
p126
aV"But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem?
p127
aVAnd does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure?"
p128
aVAnd I couldn't figure out which it was.
p129
aVAnd then I understood that actually,
p130
aVwe aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully.
p131
aVThe chemical cure and the psychological cure
p132
aVboth have a role to play,
p133
aVand I also figured out that depression was something
p134
aVthat was braided so deep into us
p135
aVthat there was no separating it from our character and personality.
p136
aa(lp137
VI want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling.
p138
aVThey're not very effective.
p139
aVThey're extremely costly.
p140
aVThey come with innumerable side effects.
p141
aVThey're a disaster.
p142
aVBut I am so grateful that I live now and not 50 years ago,
p143
aVwhen there would have been almost nothing to be done.
p144
aVI hope that 50 years hence,
p145
aVpeople will hear about my treatments
p146
aVand be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science.
p147
aa(lp148
VDepression is the flaw in love.
p149
aVIf you were married to someone and thought,
p150
aV"Well, if my wife dies, I'll find another one,"
p151
aVit wouldn't be love as we know it.
p152
aVThere's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss,
p153
aVand that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy.
p154
aa(lp155
VThere are three things people tend to confuse:
p156
aVdepression, grief and sadness.
p157
aVGrief is explicitly reactive.
p158
aVIf you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy,
p159
aVand then, six months later,
p160
aVyou are still deeply sad, but you're functioning a little better,
p161
aVit's probably grief,
p162
aVand it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure.
p163
aVIf you experience a catastrophic loss,
p164
aVand you feel terrible,
p165
aVand six months later you can barely function at all,
p166
aVthen it's probably a depression that was triggered
p167
aVby the catastrophic circumstances.
p168
aVThe trajectory tells us a great deal.
p169
aVPeople think of depression as being just sadness.
p170
aVIt's much, much too much sadness,
p171
aVmuch too much grief
p172
aVat far too slight a cause.
p173
aa(lp174
VAs I set out to understand depression,
p175
aVand to interview people who had experienced it,
p176
aVI found that there were people who seemed, on the surface,
p177
aVto have what sounded like relatively mild depression
p178
aVwho were nonetheless utterly disabled by it.
p179
aVAnd there were other people who had what sounded
p180
aVas they described it like terribly severe depression
p181
aVwho nonetheless had good lives
p182
aVin the interstices between their depressive episodes.
p183
aVAnd I set out to find out what it is that causes some people
p184
aVto be more resilient than other people.
p185
aVWhat are the mechanisms that allow people to survive?
p186
aVAnd I went out and I interviewed person after person
p187
aVwho was suffering with depression.
p188
aa(lp189
VOne of the first people I interviewed
p190
aVdescribed depression as a slower way of being dead,
p191
aVand that was a good thing for me to hear early on
p192
aVbecause it reminded me that that slow way of being dead
p193
aVcan lead to actual deadness,
p194
aVthat this is a serious business.
p195
aVIt's the leading disability worldwide,
p196
aVand people die of it every day.
p197
aa(lp198
VOne of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this
p199
aVwas a beloved friend who I had known for many years,
p200
aVand who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college,
p201
aVand then plummeted into a horrific depression.
p202
aVShe had bipolar illness,
p203
aVor manic depression, as it was then known.
p204
aVAnd then she did very well for many years on lithium,
p205
aVand then eventually, she was taken off her lithium
p206
aVto see how she would do without it,
p207
aVand she had another psychosis,
p208
aVand then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen
p209
aVin which she sat in her parents' apartment,
p210
aVmore or less catatonic, essentially without moving,
p211
aVday after day after day.
p212
aVAnd when I interviewed her about that experience some years later \u2014
p213
aVshe's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins \u2014
p214
aVwhen I interviewed her, she said,
p215
aV"I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone,'
p216
aVover and over, to occupy my mind.
p217
aVI was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying,
p218
aVwhich were, 'You are nothing. You are nobody.
p219
aVYou don't even deserve to live.'
p220
aVAnd that was when I really started thinking
p221
aVabout killing myself."
p222
aa(lp223
VYou don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil
p224
aVand are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood.
p225
aVYou think that the veil has been taken away,
p226
aVthe veil of happiness,
p227
aVand that now you're seeing truly.
p228
aVIt's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive
p229
aVthat there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised,
p230
aVbut it's difficult with depressives,
p231
aVbecause we believe we are seeing the truth.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut the truth lies.
p234
aVI became obsessed with that sentence:
p235
aV"But the truth lies."
p236
aVAnd I discovered, as I talked to depressive people,
p237
aVthat they have many delusional perceptions.
p238
aVPeople will say, "No one loves me."
p239
aVAnd you say, "I love you,
p240
aVyour wife loves you, your mother loves you."
p241
aVYou can answer that one pretty readily, at least for most people.
p242
aVBut people who are depressed will also say,
p243
aV"No matter what we do, we're all just going to die in the end."
p244
aVOr they'll say, "There can be no true communion
p245
aVbetween two human beings.
p246
aVEach of us is trapped in his own body."
p247
aVTo which you have to say,
p248
aV"That's true,
p249
aVbut I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast."
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VA lot of the time,
p254
aVwhat they are expressing is not illness, but insight,
p255
aVand one comes to think what's really extraordinary
p256
aVis that most of us know about those existential questions
p257
aVand they don't distract us very much.
p258
aVThere was a study I particularly liked
p259
aVin which a group of depressed and a group of non-depressed people
p260
aVwere asked to play a video game for an hour,
p261
aVand at the end of the hour,
p262
aVthey were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed.
p263
aVThe depressive group was usually accurate to within about 10 percent,
p264
aVand the non-depressed people
p265
aVguessed between 15 and 20 times as many little monsters \u2014
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
Vas they had actually killed.
p270
aa(lp271
VA lot of people said, when I chose to write about my depression,
p272
aVthat it must be very difficult to be out of that closet,
p273
aVto have people know.
p274
aVThey said, "Do people talk to you differently?"
p275
aVI said, "Yes, people talk to me differently.
p276
aVThey talk to me differently insofar
p277
aVas they start telling me about their experience,
p278
aVor their sister's experience,
p279
aVor their friend's experience.
p280
aVThings are different because now I know
p281
aVthat depression is the family secret that everyone has.
p282
aa(lp283
VI went a few years ago to a conference,
p284
aVand on Friday of the three-day conference,
p285
aVone of the participants took me aside, and she said,
p286
aV"I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it,
p287
aVbut I've been taking this medication,
p288
aVand I just wanted to ask you what you think?"
p289
aVAnd so I did my best to give her such advice as I could.
p290
aVAnd then she said, "You know, my husband would never understand this.
p291
aVHe's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense,
p292
aVso, you know, it's just between us."
p293
aVAnd I said, "Yes, that's fine."
p294
aVOn Sunday of the same conference,
p295
aVher husband took me aside,
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
Vand he said, "My wife wouldn't think
p300
aVthat I was really much of a guy if she knew this,
p301
aVbut I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication,
p302
aVand I wondered what you think?"
p303
aVThey were hiding the same medication
p304
aVin two different places in the same bedroom.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd I said that I thought communication within the marriage
p309
aVmight be triggering some of their problems.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VBut I was also struck
p314
aVby the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy.
p315
aVDepression is so exhausting.
p316
aVIt takes up so much of your time and energy,
p317
aVand silence about it,
p318
aVit really does make the depression worse.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd then I began thinking
p321
aVabout all the ways people make themselves better.
p322
aVI'd started off as a medical conservative.
p323
aVI thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked,
p324
aVit was clear what they were \u2014
p325
aVthere was medication,
p326
aVthere were certain psychotherapies,
p327
aVthere was possibly electroconvulsive treatment,
p328
aVand that everything else was nonsense.
p329
aVBut then I discovered something.
p330
aVIf you have brain cancer,
p331
aVand you say that standing on your head for 20 minutes every morning
p332
aVmakes you feel better,
p333
aVit may make you feel better, but you still have brain cancer,
p334
aVand you'll still probably die from it.
p335
aVBut if you say that you have depression,
p336
aVand standing on your head for 20 minutes every day
p337
aVmakes you feel better, then it's worked,
p338
aVbecause depression is an illness of how you feel,
p339
aVand if you feel better,
p340
aVthen you are effectively not depressed anymore.
p341
aVSo I became much more tolerant
p342
aVof the vast world of alternative treatments.
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd I get letters, I get hundreds of letters
p345
aVfrom people writing to tell me about what's worked for them.
p346
aVSomeone was asking me backstage today about meditation.
p347
aVMy favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman
p348
aVwho wrote and said that she had tried therapy, medication,
p349
aVshe had tried pretty much everything,
p350
aVand she had found a solution and hoped I would tell the world,
p351
aVand that was making little things from yarn.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VShe sent me some of them.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd I'm not wearing them right now.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VI suggested to her that she also should look up
p364
aVobsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd yet, when I went to look at alternative treatments,
p367
aVI also gained perspective on other treatments.
p368
aVI went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal
p369
aVthat involved a great deal of ram's blood
p370
aVand that I'm not going to detail right now,
p371
aVbut a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda,
p372
aVworking on a different project,
p373
aVand I happened to describe my experience to someone,
p374
aVand he said,
p375
aV"Well, that's West Africa, and we're in East Africa,
p376
aVand our rituals are in some ways very different,
p377
aVbut we do have some rituals
p378
aVthat have something in common with what you're describing."
p379
aVAnd he said,
p380
aV"But we've had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers,
p381
aVespecially the ones who came right after the genocide."
p382
aVI said, "What kind of trouble did you have?"
p383
aVAnd he said, "Well, they would do this bizarre thing.
p384
aVThey didn't take people out in the sunshine
p385
aVwhere you begin to feel better.
p386
aVThey didn't include drumming or music to get people's blood going.
p387
aVThey didn't involve the whole community.
p388
aVThey didn't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit.
p389
aVInstead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms
p390
aVand had them talk for an hour
p391
aVabout bad things that had happened to them."
p392
aa(lp393
V(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
V(Applause)
p396
aa(lp397
VHe said, "We had to ask them to leave the country."
p398
aa(lp399
V(Laughter)
p400
aa(lp401
VNow at the other end of alternative treatments,
p402
aVlet me tell you about Frank Russakoff.
p403
aVFrank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I've ever seen in a man.
p404
aVHe was constantly depressed.
p405
aVHe was, when I met him,
p406
aVat a point at which every month, he would have electroshock treatment.
p407
aVThen he would feel sort of disoriented for a week.
p408
aVThen he would feel okay for a week.
p409
aVThen he would have a week of going downhill.
p410
aVAnd then he would have another electroshock treatment.
p411
aVAnd he said to me when I met him,
p412
aV"It's unbearable to go through my weeks this way.
p413
aVI can't go on this way,
p414
aVand I've figured out how I'm going to end it
p415
aVif I don't get better."
p416
aV"But," he said to me, "I heard about a protocol at Mass General
p417
aVfor a procedure called a cingulotomy, which is a brain surgery,
p418
aVand I think I'm going to give that a try."
p419
aVAnd I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone
p420
aVwho clearly had so many bad experiences
p421
aVwith so many different treatments
p422
aVstill had buried in him, somewhere, enough optimism
p423
aVto reach out for one more.
p424
aVAnd he had the cingulotomy, and it was incredibly successful.
p425
aa(lp426
VHe's now a friend of mine.
p427
aVHe has a lovely wife and two beautiful children.
p428
aVHe wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery,
p429
aVand he said,
p430
aV"My father sent me two presents this year,
p431
aVFirst, a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image
p432
aVthat I didn't really need,
p433
aVbut I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate
p434
aVthe fact that I'm living on my own and have a job I seem to love.
p435
aVAnd the other present was a photo of my grandmother,
p436
aVwho committed suicide.
p437
aVAs I unwrapped it, I began to cry,
p438
aVand my mother came over and said,
p439
aV'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew?'
p440
aVAnd I said, 'She had the same disease I have.'
p441
aVI'm crying now as I write to you.
p442
aVIt's not that I'm so sad, but I get overwhelmed,
p443
aVI think, because I could have killed myself,
p444
aVbut my parents kept me going, and so did the doctors,
p445
aVand I had the surgery.
p446
aVI'm alive and grateful.
p447
aVWe live in the right time, even if it doesn't always feel like it."
p448
aa(lp449
VI was struck by the fact that depression
p450
aVis broadly perceived to be a modern, Western, middle-class thing,
p451
aVand I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts,
p452
aVand one of the things I was most interested in
p453
aVwas depression among the indigent.
p454
aVAnd so I went out to try to look
p455
aVat what was being done for poor people with depression.
p456
aVAnd what I discovered is that poor people
p457
aVare mostly not being treated for depression.
p458
aVDepression is the result of a genetic vulnerability,
p459
aVwhich is presumably evenly distributed in the population,
p460
aVand triggering circumstances,
p461
aVwhich are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished.
p462
aVAnd yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life
p463
aVbut feel miserable all the time,
p464
aVyou think, "Why do I feel like this?
p465
aVI must have depression."
p466
aVAnd you set out to find treatment for it.
p467
aVBut if you have a perfectly awful life,
p468
aVand you feel miserable all the time,
p469
aVthe way you feel is commensurate with your life,
p470
aVand it doesn't occur to you to think,
p471
aV"Maybe this is treatable."
p472
aa(lp473
VAnd so we have an epidemic in this country
p474
aVof depression among impoverished people
p475
aVthat's not being picked up and that's not being treated
p476
aVand that's not being addressed,
p477
aVand it's a tragedy of a grand order.
p478
aVAnd so I found an academic
p479
aVwho was doing a research project in slums outside of D.C.,
p480
aVwhere she picked up women who had come in for other health problems
p481
aVand diagnosed them with depression,
p482
aVand then provided six months of the experimental protocol.
p483
aVOne of them, Lolly, came in,
p484
aVand this is what she said the day she came in.
p485
aVShe said, and she was a woman, by the way, who had seven children.
p486
aVShe said, "I used to have a job but I had to give it up
p487
aVbecause I couldn't go out of the house.
p488
aVI have nothing to say to my children.
p489
aVIn the morning, I can't wait for them to leave,
p490
aVand then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head,
p491
aVand three o'clock when they come home,
p492
aVit just comes so fast."
p493
aVShe said, "I've been taking a lot of Tylenol,
p494
aVanything I can take so that I can sleep more.
p495
aVMy husband has been telling me I'm stupid, I'm ugly.
p496
aVI wish I could stop the pain."
p497
aa(lp498
VWell, she was brought into this experimental protocol,
p499
aVand when I interviewed her six months later,
p500
aVshe had taken a job working in childcare
p501
aVfor the U.S. Navy, she had left the abusive husband,
p502
aVand she said to me,
p503
aV"My kids are so much happier now."
p504
aVShe said, "There's one room in my new place for the boys
p505
aVand one room for the girls,
p506
aVbut at night, they're just all up on my bed,
p507
aVand we're doing homework all together and everything.
p508
aVOne of them wants to be a preacher,
p509
aVone of them wants to be a firefighter,
p510
aVand one of the girls says she's going to be a lawyer.
p511
aVThey don't cry like they used to,
p512
aVand they don't fight like they did.
p513
aVThat's all I need now, is my kids.
p514
aVThings keep on changing,
p515
aVthe way I dress, the way I feel, the way I act.
p516
aVI can go outside not being afraid anymore,
p517
aVand I don't think those bad feelings are coming back,
p518
aVand if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that,
p519
aVI would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head,
p520
aVif I were still alive at all.
p521
aVI asked the Lord to send me an angel,
p522
aVand He heard my prayers."
p523
aa(lp524
VI was really moved by these experiences,
p525
aVand I decided that I wanted to write about them
p526
aVnot only in a book I was working on, but also in an article,
p527
aVand I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine
p528
aVto write about depression among the indigent.
p529
aa(lp530
VAnd I turned in my story,
p531
aVand my editor called me and said, "We really can't publish this."
p532
aa(lp533
VAnd I said, "Why not?"
p534
aa(lp535
VAnd she said, "It just is too far-fetched.
p536
aVThese people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society
p537
aVand then they get a few months of treatment
p538
aVand they're virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley?
p539
aVIt's just too implausible."
p540
aVShe said, "I've never even heard of anything like it."
p541
aa(lp542
VAnd I said, "The fact that you've never heard of it
p543
aVis an indication that it is news."
p544
aa(lp545
V(Laughter)
p546
aa(lp547
V(Applause)
p548
aa(lp549
V"And you are a news magazine."
p550
aa(lp551
VSo after a certain amount of negotiation, they agreed to it.
p552
aVBut I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way
p553
aVto this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment,
p554
aVthe notion that somehow if we went out
p555
aVand treated a lot of people in indigent communities,
p556
aVthat would be exploitative,
p557
aVbecause we would be changing them.
p558
aVThere is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us,
p559
aVthat treatment of depression,
p560
aVthe medications and so on, are an artifice,
p561
aVand that it's not natural.
p562
aVAnd I think that's very misguided.
p563
aVIt would be natural for people's teeth to fall out,
p564
aVbut there is nobody militating against toothpaste,
p565
aVat least not in my circles.
p566
aa(lp567
VPeople then say,
p568
aV"But isn't depression part of what people are supposed to experience?
p569
aVDidn't we evolve to have depression?
p570
aVIsn't it part of your personality?"
p571
aVTo which I would say, mood is adaptive.
p572
aVBeing able to have sadness and fear
p573
aVand joy and pleasure
p574
aVand all of the other moods that we have, that's incredibly valuable.
p575
aVAnd major depression
p576
aVis something that happens when that system gets broken.
p577
aVIt's maladaptive.
p578
aa(lp579
VPeople will come to me and say,
p580
aV"I think, though, if I just stick it out for another year,
p581
aVI think I can just get through this."
p582
aa(lp583
VAnd I always say to them, "You may get through it,
p584
aVbut you'll never be 37 again.
p585
aVLife is short, and that's a whole year you're talking about giving up.
p586
aVThink it through."
p587
aa(lp588
VIt's a strange poverty of the English language,
p589
aVand indeed of many other languages,
p590
aVthat we use this same word, depression,
p591
aVto describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday,
p592
aVand to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide.
p593
aa(lp594
VPeople say to me, "Well, is it continuous with normal sadness?"
p595
aVAnd I say, in a way it's continuous with normal sadness.
p596
aVThere is a certain amount of continuity,
p597
aVbut it's the same way there's continuity
p598
aVbetween having an iron fence outside your house
p599
aVthat gets a little rust spot
p600
aVthat you have to sand off and do a little repainting,
p601
aVand what happens if you leave the house for 100 years
p602
aVand it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust.
p603
aVAnd it's that orange dust spot,
p604
aVthat orange dust problem,
p605
aVthat's the one we're setting out to address.
p606
aa(lp607
VSo now people say,
p608
aV"You take these happy pills, and do you feel happy?"
p609
aVAnd I don't.
p610
aVBut I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch,
p611
aVand I don't feel sad about my answering machine,
p612
aVand I don't feel sad about taking a shower.
p613
aVI feel more, in fact, I think,
p614
aVbecause I can feel sadness without nullity.
p615
aVI feel sad about professional disappointments,
p616
aVabout damaged relationships,
p617
aVabout global warming.
p618
aVThose are the things that I feel sad about now.
p619
aVAnd I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion?
p620
aVHow did those people who have better lives
p621
aVeven with bigger depression manage to get through?
p622
aVWhat is the mechanism of resilience?
p623
aa(lp624
VAnd what I came up with over time
p625
aVwas that the people who deny their experience,
p626
aVand say, "I was depressed a long time ago,
p627
aVI never want to think about it again,
p628
aVI'm not going to look at it
p629
aVand I'm just going to get on with my life,"
p630
aVironically, those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have.
p631
aVShutting out the depression strengthens it.
p632
aVWhile you hide from it, it grows.
p633
aVAnd the people who do better
p634
aVare the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition.
p635
aVThose who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience.
p636
aa(lp637
VSo Frank Russakoff said to me,
p638
aV"If I had a do-over, I suppose I wouldn't do it this way,
p639
aVbut in a strange way, I'm grateful for what I've experienced.
p640
aVI'm glad to have been in the hospital 40 times.
p641
aVIt taught me so much about love,
p642
aVand my relationship with my parents and my doctors
p643
aVhas been so precious to me, and will be always."
p644
aa(lp645
VAnd Maggie Robbins said,
p646
aV"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic,
p647
aVand I would just talk and talk and talk,
p648
aVand the people I was dealing with weren't very responsive, and I thought,
p649
aV'That's not very friendly or helpful of them.'"
p650
aa(lp651
V(Laughter)
p652
aa(lp653
V"And then I realized,
p654
aVI realized that they weren't going to do more
p655
aVthan make those first few minutes of small talk.
p656
aVIt was simply going to be an occasion
p657
aVwhere I didn't have AIDS and I wasn't dying,
p658
aVbut could tolerate the fact that they did
p659
aVand they were.
p660
aVOur needs are our greatest assets.
p661
aVIt turns out I've learned to give all the things I need."
p662
aa(lp663
VValuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse,
p664
aVbut it may make the prospect of relapse
p665
aVand even relapse itself easier to tolerate.
p666
aVThe question is not so much of finding great meaning
p667
aVand deciding your depression has been very meaningful.
p668
aVIt's of seeking that meaning and thinking, when it comes again,
p669
aV"This will be hellish, but I will learn something from it."
p670
aVI have learned in my own depression
p671
aVhow big an emotion can be,
p672
aVhow it can be more real than facts,
p673
aVand I have found that that experience
p674
aVhas allowed me to experience positive emotion
p675
aVin a more intense and more focused way.
p676
aVThe opposite of depression is not happiness,
p677
aVbut vitality,
p678
aVand these days, my life is vital,
p679
aVeven on the days when I'm sad.
p680
aVI felt that funeral in my brain,
p681
aVand I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world,
p682
aVand I have discovered something inside of myself
p683
aVthat I would have to call a soul
p684
aVthat I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago
p685
aVwhen hell came to pay me a surprise visit.
p686
aa(lp687
VI think that while I hated being depressed
p688
aVand would hate to be depressed again,
p689
aVI've found a way to love my depression.
p690
aVI love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy.
p691
aVI love it because each day I decide,
p692
aVsometimes gamely,
p693
aVand sometimes against the moment's reason,
p694
aVto cleave to the reasons for living.
p695
aVAnd that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture.
p696
aa(lp697
VThank you.
p698
aa(lp699
V(Applause)
p700
aa(lp701
VThank you.

VIt was a Saturday afternoon in May,
p5
aVand I suddenly realized
p6
aVthat the next day was Mother's Day,
p7
aVand I hadn't gotten anything for my mom,
p8
aVso I started thinking about
p9
aVwhat should I get my mom for Mother's Day?
p10
aVI thought, why don't I make her
p11
aVan interactive Mother's Day card
p12
aVusing the Scratch software that I'd been developing
p13
aVwith my research group at the MIT Media Lab?
p14
aVWe developed it so that people could easily create
p15
aVtheir own interactive stories and games and animations,
p16
aVand then share their creations with one another.
p17
aVSo I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch
p18
aVto make an interactive card for my mom.
p19
aa(lp20
VBefore making my own Mother's Day card,
p21
aVI thought I would take a look
p22
aVat the Scratch website.
p23
aVSo over the last several years, kids around the world
p24
aVages 8 and up, have shared their projects,
p25
aVand I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects,
p26
aVwhether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards.
p27
aVSo in the search box I typed in
p28
aV"Mother's Day,"
p29
aVand I was surprised and delighted to see a list
p30
aVof dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards
p31
aVthat showed up on the Scratch website,
p32
aVmany of them just in the past 24 hours
p33
aVby procrastinators just like myself.
p34
aVSo I started taking a look at them. (Music)
p35
aVI saw one of them that featured a kitten
p36
aVand her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day.
p37
aVAnd the creator very considerately
p38
aVoffered a replay for her mom.
p39
aVAnother one was an interactive project where,
p40
aVwhen you moved the mouse over the letters of "Happy Mom Day,"
p41
aVit reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan.
p42
aV(Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative
p43
aVabout how she had Googled to find out
p44
aVwhen Mother's Day was happening.
p45
aV(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening,
p46
aVshe delivered a special Mother's Day greeting
p47
aVof how much she loved her mom.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo I really enjoyed looking at these projects
p50
aVand interacting with these projects.
p51
aVIn fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project,
p52
aVI sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter)
p53
aVAnd actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.
p54
aVShe wrote back to me and she said,
p55
aV"I'm so proud to have a son that created the software
p56
aVthat allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."
p57
aa(lp58
VSo my mom was happy, and that made me happy,
p59
aVbut actually I was even happier for another reason.
p60
aVI was happy because these kids were using Scratch
p61
aVjust in the way that we had hoped that they would.
p62
aVAs they created their interactive Mother's Day cards,
p63
aVyou could see that they were really
p64
aVbecoming fluent with new technologies.
p65
aVWhat do I mean by fluent?
p66
aVI mean that they were able to start expressing themselves
p67
aVand to start expressing their ideas.
p68
aVWhen you become fluent with language,
p69
aVit means you can write an entry in your journal
p70
aVor tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend.
p71
aVAnd it's similar with new technologies.
p72
aVBy writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards,
p73
aVthese kids were showing that they were really fluent
p74
aVwith new technologies.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow maybe you won't be so surprised by this,
p77
aVbecause a lot of times people feel that
p78
aVyoung people today can do all sorts of things with technology.
p79
aVI mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as "digital natives."
p80
aVBut actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term.
p81
aVI'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives.
p82
aVWhen you really look at it, how is it that young people
p83
aVspend most of their time using new technologies?
p84
aVYou often see them in situations like this,
p85
aVor like this,
p86
aVand there's no doubt that young people
p87
aVare very comfortable and familiar browsing
p88
aVand chatting and texting and gaming.
p89
aVBut that doesn't really make you fluent.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo young people today have lots of experience
p92
aVand lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies,
p93
aVbut a lot less so of creating with new technologies
p94
aVand expressing themselves with new technologies.
p95
aVIt's almost as if they can read
p96
aVbut not write with new technologies.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent
p99
aVso they can write with new technologies?
p100
aVAnd that really means that they need to be able to
p101
aVwrite their own computer programs, or code.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo, increasingly, people are starting to recognize
p104
aVthe importance of learning to code.
p105
aVYou know, in recent years, there have been
p106
aVhundreds of new organizations and websites
p107
aVthat are helping young people learn to code.
p108
aVYou look online, you'll see places like Codecademy
p109
aVand events like CoderDojo
p110
aVand sites like Girls Who Code,
p111
aVor Black Girls Code.
p112
aVIt seems that everybody is getting into the act.
p113
aVYou know, just at the beginning of this year,
p114
aVat the turn of the new year,
p115
aVNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
p116
aVmade a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn
p117
aVto code in 2012.
p118
aVA few months later, the country of Estonia decided that
p119
aVall of its first graders should learn to code.
p120
aVAnd that triggered a debate in the U.K.
p121
aVabout whether all the children there should learn to code.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, for some of you, when you hear about this,
p124
aVit might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code.
p125
aVWhen many people think of coding, they think of it
p126
aVas something that only a very narrow sub-community
p127
aVof people are going to be doing,
p128
aVand they think of coding looking like this.
p129
aVAnd in fact, if this is what coding is like,
p130
aVit will only be a narrow sub-community of people
p131
aVwith special mathematical skills and technological background
p132
aVthat can code.
p133
aa(lp134
VBut coding doesn't have to be like this.
p135
aVLet me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch.
p136
aVSo in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.
p137
aVIn this case, you take a move block,
p138
aVsnap it into a stack,
p139
aVand the stacks of blocks control the behaviors
p140
aVof the different characters in your game or your story,
p141
aVin this case controlling the big fish.
p142
aVAfter you've created your program, you can click on "share,"
p143
aVand then share your project with other people,
p144
aVso that they can use the project
p145
aVand start working on the project as well.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo, of course, making a fish game isn't the only thing
p148
aVyou can do with Scratch.
p149
aVOf the millions of projects on the Scratch website,
p150
aVthere's everything from animated stories
p151
aVto school science projects
p152
aVto anime soap operas
p153
aVto virtual construction kits
p154
aVto recreations of classic video games
p155
aVto political opinion polls
p156
aVto trigonometry tutorials
p157
aVto interactive artwork, and, yes,
p158
aVinteractive Mother's Day cards.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo I think there's so many different ways
p161
aVthat people can express themselves using this,
p162
aVto be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world.
p163
aVAnd it doesn't just stay on the screen.
p164
aVYou can also code to interact with the physical world around you.
p165
aVHere's an example from Hong Kong,
p166
aVwhere some kids made a game
p167
aVand then built their own physical interface device
p168
aVand had a light sensor, so the light sensor
p169
aVdetects the hole in the board,
p170
aVso as they move the physical saw,
p171
aVthe light sensor detects the hole
p172
aVand controls the virtual saw on the screen
p173
aVand saws down the tree.
p174
aa(lp175
VWe're going to continue to look at new ways
p176
aVof bringing together the physical world and the virtual world
p177
aVand connecting to the world around us.
p178
aVThis is an example from a new version of Scratch
p179
aVthat we'll be releasing in the next few months,
p180
aVand we're looking again to be able
p181
aVto push you in new directions.
p182
aVHere's an example.
p183
aVIt uses the webcam.
p184
aVAnd as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons
p185
aVor I can move the bug.
p186
aVSo it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect,
p187
aVwhere you interact with gestures in the world.
p188
aVBut instead of just playing someone else's game,
p189
aVyou get to create the games,
p190
aVand if you see someone else's game,
p191
aVyou can just say "see inside,"
p192
aVand you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it.
p193
aVSo there's a new block that says how much video motion there is,
p194
aVand then, if there's so much video motion,
p195
aVit will then tell the balloon to pop.
p196
aa(lp197
VThe same way that this uses the camera
p198
aVto get information into Scratch,
p199
aVyou can also use the microphone.
p200
aVHere's an example of a project using the microphone.
p201
aVSo I'm going to let all of you control this game
p202
aVusing your voices.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping)
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aV(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
VAs kids are creating projects like this,
p209
aVthey're learning to code,
p210
aVbut even more importantly, they're coding to learn.
p211
aVBecause as they learn to code,
p212
aVit enables them to learn many other things,
p213
aVopens up many new opportunities for learning.
p214
aVAgain, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing.
p215
aVWhen you learn to read and write, it opens up
p216
aVopportunities for you to learn so many other things.
p217
aVWhen you learn to read, you can then read to learn.
p218
aVAnd it's the same thing with coding.
p219
aVIf you learn to code, you can code to learn.
p220
aVNow some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious.
p221
aVYou learn more about how computers work.
p222
aVBut that's just where it starts.
p223
aVWhen you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn
p224
aVmany other things.
p225
aa(lp226
VLet me show you an example.
p227
aVHere's another project,
p228
aVand I saw this when I was visiting
p229
aVone of the computer clubhouses.
p230
aVThese are after-school learning centers that we helped start
p231
aVthat help young people from low-income communities
p232
aVlearn to express themselves creatively with new technologies.
p233
aVAnd when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago,
p234
aVI saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software
p235
aVto create a game somewhat like this one,
p236
aVand he was very happy with his game and proud of his game,
p237
aVbut also he wanted to do more.
p238
aVHe wanted to keep score.
p239
aVSo this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish,
p240
aVbut he wanted to keep score, so that each time
p241
aVthe big fish eats the little fish,
p242
aVthe score would go up and it would keep track,
p243
aVand he didn't know how to do that.
p244
aVSo I showed him.
p245
aVIn Scratch, you can create something called a variable.
p246
aVI'll call it score.
p247
aVAnd that creates some new blocks for you,
p248
aVand also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score,
p249
aVso each time I click on "change score," it increments the score.
p250
aVSo I showed this to the clubhouse member \u2014
p251
aVlet's call him Victor \u2014 and Victor,
p252
aVwhen he saw that this block would let him increment the score,
p253
aVhe knew exactly what to do.
p254
aVHe took the block
p255
aVand he put it into the program
p256
aVexactly where the big fish eats the little fish.
p257
aVSo then, each time the big fish eats the little fish,
p258
aVhe will increment the score, and the score will go up by one.
p259
aVAnd it's in fact working.
p260
aVAnd he saw this, and he was so excited,
p261
aVhe reached his hand out to me,
p262
aVand he said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you."
p263
aVAnd what went through my mind was,
p264
aVhow often is it that teachers are thanked by their students
p265
aVfor teaching them variables? (Laughter)
p266
aVIt doesn't happen in most classrooms,
p267
aVbut that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables,
p268
aVthey don't know why they're learning it.
p269
aVIt's nothing that, really, they can make use of.
p270
aVWhen you learn ideas like this in Scratch,
p271
aVyou can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you,
p272
aVthat you can understand the reason for learning variables,
p273
aVand we see that kids learn it more deeply
p274
aVand learn it better.
p275
aVVictor had, I'm sure, been taught about variables in schools,
p276
aVbut he really didn't \u2014 he wasn't paying attention.
p277
aVNow he had a reason for learning variables.
p278
aVSo when you learn through coding, and coding to learn,
p279
aVyou're learning it in a meaningful context, and that's the best way of learning things.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo as kids like Victor are creating projects like this,
p282
aVthey're learning important concepts like variables,
p283
aVbut that's just the start.
p284
aVAs Victor worked on this project and created the scripts,
p285
aVhe was also learning about the process of design,
p286
aVhow to start with the glimmer of an idea
p287
aVand turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project
p288
aVlike you see here.
p289
aVSo he was learning many different core principles of design,
p290
aVabout how to experiment with new ideas,
p291
aVhow to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts,
p292
aVhow to collaborate with other people on your projects,
p293
aVabout how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong,
p294
aVhow to keep persistent and to persevere
p295
aVin the face of frustrations when things aren't working well.
p296
aVNow those are important skills
p297
aVthat aren't just relevant for coding.
p298
aVThey're relevant for all sorts of different activities.
p299
aa(lp300
VNow, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become
p301
aVa programmer or a professional computer scientist?
p302
aVIt's probably not so likely,
p303
aVbut regardless of what he does,
p304
aVhe'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned.
p305
aVRegardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager
p306
aVor a mechanic or a community organizer,
p307
aVthat these ideas are useful for everybody.
p308
aVAgain, it's useful to think about this analogy with language.
p309
aVWhen you become fluent with reading and writing,
p310
aVit's not something that you're doing
p311
aVjust to become a professional writer.
p312
aVVery few people become professional writers.
p313
aVBut it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write.
p314
aVAgain, the same thing with coding.
p315
aVMost people won't grow up to become professional
p316
aVcomputer scientists or programmers,
p317
aVbut those skills of thinking creatively,
p318
aVreasoning systematically, working collaboratively \u2014
p319
aVskills you develop when you code in Scratch \u2014
p320
aVare things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd it's not just about your work life.
p323
aVCoding can also enable you to
p324
aVexpress your ideas and feelings in your personal life.
p325
aVLet me end with just one more example.
p326
aVSo this is an example that came from
p327
aVafter I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom,
p328
aVshe decided that she wanted to learn Scratch.
p329
aVSo she made this project for my birthday
p330
aVand sent me a happy birthday Scratch card.
p331
aVNow this project is not going to win any prizes for design,
p332
aVand you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom
p333
aVis not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist.
p334
aVBut working on this project enabled her
p335
aVto make a connection to someone that she cares about
p336
aVand enabled her to keep on learning new things
p337
aVand continuing to practice her creativity
p338
aVand developing new ways of expressing herself.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo as we take a look and we see that
p341
aVMichael Bloomberg is learning to code,
p342
aVall of the children of Estonia learn to code,
p343
aVeven my mom has learned to code,
p344
aVdon't you think it's about time that you might be
p345
aVthinking about learning to code?
p346
aVIf you're interested in giving it a try,
p347
aVI'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website.
p348
aVIt's scratch.mit.edu,
p349
aVand give a try at coding.
p350
aa(lp351
VThanks very much. (Applause)

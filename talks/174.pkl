VAs an architect you design for the present,
p5
aVwith an awareness of the past,
p6
aVfor a future which is essentially unknown.
p7
aVThe green agenda is probably the most important agenda
p8
aVand issue of the day.
p9
aVAnd I'd like to share some experience
p10
aVover the last 40 years \u2014 we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year \u2014
p11
aVand to explore and to touch on some observations
p12
aVabout the nature of sustainability.
p13
aVHow far you can anticipate, what follows from it,
p14
aVwhat are the threats, what are the possibilities,
p15
aVthe challenges, the opportunities?
p16
aVI think that \u2014 I've said in the past, many, many years ago,
p17
aVbefore anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda,
p18
aVthat it wasn't about fashion \u2014 it was about survival.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is,
p21
aVthat really, green is cool.
p22
aVI mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired
p23
aVby that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle,
p24
aVin a way celebrating the places and the spaces
p25
aVwhich determine the quality of life.
p26
aVI rarely actually quote anything,
p27
aVso I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can,
p28
aV[in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought
p29
aVabout what for that individual, as a kind of important observer,
p30
aVanalyst, writer \u2014 a guy called Thomas Friedman,
p31
aVwho wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006.
p32
aVHe said,
p33
aV"I think the most important thing to happen in 2006
p34
aVwas that living and thinking green hit Main Street.
p35
aVWe reached a tipping point this year
p36
aVwhere living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green
p37
aVcame to be understood by a critical mass
p38
aVof citizens, entrepreneurs and officials
p39
aVas the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political
p40
aVand competitive thing they could do.
p41
aVHence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue."
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd I asked myself, in a way, looking back,
p44
aV"When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?"
p45
aVAnd I think it was July 20, 1969,
p46
aVwhen, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.
p47
aVAnd, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.
p48
aVAnd before the kind of collapse of the communist system,
p49
aVI was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts
p50
aVin Space City and other places in Russia.
p51
aVAnd interestingly, as I think back,
p52
aVthey were the first true environmentalists.
p53
aVThey were filled with a kind of pioneering passion,
p54
aVfired about the problems of the Aral Sea.
p55
aVAnd at that period it was \u2014
p56
aVin a way, a number of things were happening.
p57
aVBuckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru \u2014
p58
aVagain, a word that had not been coined.
p59
aVHe was a design scientist, if you like, a poet,
p60
aVbut he foresaw all the things that are happening now.
p61
aVIt's another subject. It's another conversation.
p62
aVYou can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.
p63
aVIt was at that time, with an awareness
p64
aVfired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns
p65
aVas a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet,
p66
aVthat influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd it's a number of projects.
p69
aVI select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan
p70
aVfor one of the Canary Islands.
p71
aVAnd this probably coincided with the time
p72
aVwhen you had the planet Earth's sourcebook,
p73
aVand you had the hippie movement.
p74
aVAnd there are some of those qualities in this drawing,
p75
aVwhich seeks to sum up the recommendations.
p76
aVAnd all the components are there which are now
p77
aVin common parlance, in our vocabulary,
p78
aVyou know, 30-odd years later:
p79
aVwind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.
p80
aVAnd in parallel at that time, there was
p81
aVa very kind of exclusive design club.
p82
aVPeople who were really design conscious
p83
aVwere inspired by the work of Dieter Rams,
p84
aVand the objects that he would create
p85
aVfor the company called Braun.
p86
aVThis is going back the mid-'50s, '60s.
p87
aVAnd despite Bucky's prophecies
p88
aVthat everything would be miniaturized
p89
aVand technology would make an incredible style \u2014
p90
aVaccess to comfort, to amenities \u2014
p91
aVit was very, very difficult to imagine
p92
aVthat everything that we see in this image,
p93
aVwould be very, very stylishly packaged.
p94
aVAnd that, and more besides, would be in the palm of your hand.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd I think that that digital revolution
p97
aVnow is coming to the point
p98
aVwhere, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here,
p99
aVfinally connects with the physical world,
p100
aVthere is the reality that that has become humanized,
p101
aVso that digital world has all the friendliness,
p102
aVall the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.
p103
aVProbably summed up in a way
p104
aVby the stylish or alternative available here,
p105
aVas we generously had gifted at lunchtime,
p106
aVthe [unclear], which is a further kind of development \u2014
p107
aVand again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.
p108
aVA very, very beautiful object.
p109
aVSo, something which in [the] '50s, '60s was very exclusive
p110
aVhas now become, interestingly, quite inclusive.
p111
aVAnd the reference to the iPod as iconic,
p112
aVand in a way evocative of performance, delivery \u2014
p113
aVquite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007,
p114
aVthe Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies
p115
aVenvy the halo effect that Toyota has gained
p116
aVfrom the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle,
p117
aVwhich rivals the iPod as an iconic product.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves \u2014
p120
aVas architects, or anybody involved with the design process \u2014
p121
aVthat the answer to our problems lies with buildings.
p122
aVBuildings are important, but
p123
aVthey're only a component of a much bigger picture.
p124
aVIn other words, as I might seek to demonstrate,
p125
aVif you could achieve the impossible,
p126
aVthe equivalent of perpetual motion,
p127
aVyou could design a carbon-free house, for example.
p128
aVThat would be the answer.
p129
aVUnfortunately, it's not the answer.
p130
aVIt's only the beginning of the problem.
p131
aVYou cannot separate the buildings out
p132
aVfrom the infrastructure of cites
p133
aVand the mobility of transit.
p134
aVFor example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back
p135
aVand we look at planet Earth,
p136
aVand we take a kind of typical, industrialized society,
p137
aVthen the energy consumed would be split
p138
aVbetween the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.
p139
aVBut again, that only shows part of the picture.
p140
aVIf you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport,
p141
aVin other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent,
p142
aVthen 70 percent of the energy consumption
p143
aVis influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo the problems of sustainability
p146
aVcannot be separated from the nature of the cities,
p147
aVof which the buildings are a part.
p148
aVFor example, if you take, and you make a comparison
p149
aVbetween a recent kind of city,
p150
aVwhat I'll call, simplistically, a North American city \u2014
p151
aVand Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.
p152
aVThe city goes out in annular rings,
p153
aVconsuming more and more green space,
p154
aVand more and more roads, and more and more energy
p155
aVin the transport of people between the city center \u2014
p156
aVwhich again, the city center, as it becomes deprived
p157
aVof the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.
p158
aVIf you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example \u2014
p159
aVand Munich is not a bad example of that,
p160
aVwith the greater dependence on walking and cycling \u2014
p161
aVthen a city which is really only twice as dense,
p162
aVis only using one-tenth of the energy.
p163
aVIn other words, you take these comparable examples
p164
aVand the energy leap is enormous.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate
p167
aVthat as the density increases along the bottom there,
p168
aVthat the energy consumed reduces dramatically.
p169
aVOf course you can't separate this out from issues like
p170
aVsocial diversity, mass transit,
p171
aVthe ability to be able to walk a convenient distance,
p172
aVthe quality of civic spaces.
p173
aVBut again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top,
p174
aVextraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen.
p175
aVAnd Copenhagen, although it's a dense city,
p176
aVis not dense compared with the really dense cities.
p177
aVIn the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.
p178
aVYou had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more,
p179
aVwhich were occurring in the developing world.
p180
aVAnd now, out of typically 46 cities,
p181
aV33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.
p182
aVSo you have to ask yourself \u2014 the environmental impact of,
p183
aVfor example, China or India.
p184
aVIf you take China, and you just take Beijing,
p185
aVyou can see on that traffic system,
p186
aVand the pollution associated with the consumption of energy
p187
aVas the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.
p188
aVIn other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening,
p189
aV1,000 new cars every day \u2014
p190
aVstatistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world \u2014
p191
aVand the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd that urbanization is extraordinary, accelerated pace.
p194
aVSo, if we think of the transition in our society
p195
aVof the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years,
p196
aVthen that same process is happening in 20 years.
p197
aVIn other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.
p198
aVAnd quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period,
p199
aVwe're seeing the doubling in life expectancy,
p200
aVover that period where the urbanization has trebled.
p201
aVIf I pull back from that global picture,
p202
aVand I look at the implication over a similar period of time
p203
aVin terms of the technology \u2014 which, as a tool,
p204
aVis a tool for designers,
p205
aVand I cite our own experience as a company,
p206
aVand I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects \u2014
p207
aVthen how do you measure that change of technology?
p208
aVHow does it affect the design of buildings?
p209
aVAnd particularly, how can it lead
p210
aVto the creation of buildings which consume less energy,
p211
aVcreate less pollution and are more socially responsible?
p212
aa(lp213
VThat story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early '70s.
p214
aVThe one example I take is a corporate headquarters
p215
aVfor a company called Willis and Faber,
p216
aVin a small market town in the northeast of England,
p217
aVcommuting distance with London.
p218
aVAnd here, the first thing you can see
p219
aVis that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of
p220
aVovercoat blanket, a kind of insulating garden,
p221
aVwhich is also about the celebration of public space.
p222
aVIn other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.
p223
aVSo the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work,
p224
aVencapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here,
p225
aVwhere you can see greenery, you can see sunlight,
p226
aVyou have a connection with nature.
p227
aVAnd nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.
p228
aVAnd symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.
p229
aVIt has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime,
p230
aVit has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.
p231
aVNow this was 1973.
p232
aa(lp233
VIn 2001, this building received an award.
p234
aVAnd the award was about a celebration for a building
p235
aVwhich had been in use over a long period of time.
p236
aVAnd the people who'd created it came back:
p237
aVthe project managers, the company chairmen then.
p238
aVAnd they were saying, you know,
p239
aV"The architects, Norman was always going on about
p240
aVdesigning for the future, and you know,
p241
aVit didn't seem to cost us any more.
p242
aVSo we humored him, we kept him happy."
p243
aVThe image at the top,
p244
aVwhat it doesn't \u2014 if you look at it in detail,
p245
aVreally what it is saying is you can wire this building.
p246
aVThis building was wired for change.
p247
aVSo, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.
p248
aVAnd when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.
p249
aVAnd what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors
p250
aVhad to build new buildings for the new technology.
p251
aVWe were fortunate,
p252
aVbecause in a way our building was future-proofed.
p253
aVIt anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.
p254
aVRound about that design period leading up to this building,
p255
aVI did a sketch, which we pulled out of the archive recently.
p256
aVAnd I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time,
p257
aVand we really don't have the immediate expertise
p258
aVat a technical level."
p259
aa(lp260
VIn other words, we didn't have the technology
p261
aVto do what would be really interesting on that building.
p262
aVAnd that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble \u2014
p263
aVa really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate,
p264
aVwould breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.
p265
aVNotwithstanding the fact that the building, as a green building,
p266
aVis very much a pioneering building.
p267
aVAnd if I fast-forward in time, what is interesting
p268
aVis that the technology is now available and celebratory.
p269
aVThe library of the Free University, which opened last year,
p270
aVis an example of that.
p271
aVAnd again, the transition from one of the many thousands
p272
aVof sketches and computer images to the reality.
p273
aVAnd a combination of devices here,
p274
aVthe kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks,
p275
aVand the way in which that is enclosed by this skin,
p276
aVwhich enables the building to be ventilated,
p277
aVto consume dramatically less energy,
p278
aVand where it's really working with the forces of nature.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd what is interesting is that this is hugely popular
p281
aVby the people who use it.
p282
aVAgain, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle,
p283
aVand in a way, the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.
p284
aVSo it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.
p285
aVI think it's a great \u2014 it's a celebration.
p286
aVAnd you can measure the performance,
p287
aVin terms of energy consumption, of that building
p288
aVagainst a typical library.
p289
aVIf I show another aspect of that technology
p290
aVthen, in a completely different context \u2014
p291
aVthis apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.
p292
aVPrefabricated from the most traditional of materials,
p293
aVbut that material \u2014 because of the technology, the computing ability,
p294
aVthe ability to prefabricate, make high-performance components
p295
aVout of timber \u2014 very much at the cutting edge.
p296
aVAnd just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology,
p297
aVthe ability to plot points in the sky
p298
aVand to transmit, to transfer that information
p299
aVnow, directly into the factory.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo if you cross the border \u2014 just across the border \u2014
p302
aVa small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen,
p303
aVand those points in space are communicated.
p304
aVAnd on the left are the cutting machines,
p305
aVwhich then, in the factory,
p306
aVenable those individual pieces to be fabricated
p307
aVand plus or minus very, very few millimeters,
p308
aVto be slotted together on site.
p309
aVAnd then interestingly, that building to then be clad
p310
aVin the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.
p311
aVOne quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.
p312
aVAnd again, the way in which that works as a building,
p313
aVfor those of us who can enjoy the spaces,
p314
aVto live and visit there.
p315
aVIf I made the leap into these new technologies,
p316
aVthen how did we \u2014 what happened before that?
p317
aVI mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone,
p318
aVthe things that you take for granted?
p319
aa(lp320
VWell, obviously the building still happened.
p321
aVI mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979,
p322
aVwhich opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight
p323
aVdeep into the heart of this space here.
p324
aVAnd in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.
p325
aVSo for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.
p326
aVFor wind tunnels, we would literally put them
p327
aVin a wind tunnel and blast air,
p328
aVand the many kilometers of cable and so on.
p329
aVAnd the turning point was probably, in our terms,
p330
aVwhen we had the first computer.
p331
aVAnd that was at the time that we sought
p332
aVto redesign, reinvent the airport.
p333
aVThis is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal \u2014
p334
aVbig, heavy roof, blocking out the sunlight,
p335
aVlots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd Stansted, the green alternative,
p338
aVwhich uses natural light, is a friendly place:
p339
aVyou know where you are, you can relate to the outside.
p340
aVAnd for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light \u2014
p341
aVelectric light, which in turn creates more heat,
p342
aVwhich creates more cooling loads and so on.
p343
aVAnd at that particular point in time,
p344
aVthis was one of the few solitary computers.
p345
aVAnd that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.
p346
aVNot going back very far in time, 1990,
p347
aVthat's our office.
p348
aVAnd if you looked very closely, you'd see
p349
aVthat people were drawing with pencils,
p350
aVand they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.
p351
aVIt's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.
p352
aVI mean, major transformation.
p353
aa(lp354
VGoing back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin,
p355
aVand in 1987, she had all our information on one disk.
p356
aVNow, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks,
p357
aVwhich record our archival information
p358
aVon past, current and future projects.
p359
aVThat reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.
p360
aVThis is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.
p361
aVBut meanwhile, as you know,
p362
aVwonderful protagonists like Al Gore
p363
aVare noting the inexorable rise in temperature,
p364
aVset in the context of that,
p365
aVinterestingly, those buildings which are celebratory
p366
aVand very, very relevant to this place.
p367
aa(lp368
VOur Reichstag project,
p369
aVwhich has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure,
p370
aVas a public place where we sought to, in a way,
p371
aVthrough a process of advocacy,
p372
aVreinterpret the relationship between society and politicians,
p373
aVpublic space. And maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto \u2014
p374
aVsomething that would be free, completely free
p375
aVof fuel as we know it.
p376
aVSo it would be totally renewable.
p377
aVAnd again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space,
p378
aVbut this very, very much a part of the ecology.
p379
aVBut here, not having to model it for real.
p380
aVObviously the wind tunnel had a place,
p381
aVbut the ability now with the computer
p382
aVto explore, to plan, to see how that would work
p383
aVin terms of the forces of nature:
p384
aVnatural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below,
p385
aVand to look at biomass.
p386
aVA combination of biomass, aquifers, burning vegetable oil \u2014
p387
aVa process that, quite interestingly, was developed
p388
aVin Eastern Germany, at the time of its
p389
aVdependence on the Soviet Bloc.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo really, retranslating that technology and developing something
p392
aVwhich was so clean, it was virtually pollution-free.
p393
aVYou can measure it again.
p394
aVYou can compare how that building, in terms of its emission
p395
aVin tons of carbon dioxide per year \u2014
p396
aVat the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons \u2014
p397
aVwhat it would have been with natural gas
p398
aVand finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons.
p399
aVI mean, a 94 percent reduction \u2014 virtually clean.
p400
aVWe can see the same processes at work
p401
aVin terms of the Commerce Bank \u2014
p402
aVits dependence on natural ventilation,
p403
aVthe way that you can model those gardens,
p404
aVthe way they spiral around.
p405
aVBut again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality \u2014
p406
aVsomething that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.
p407
aVAnd again, we can measure the reduction
p408
aVin terms of energy consumption.
p409
aa(lp410
VThere is an evolution here between the projects,
p411
aVand Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further \u2014
p412
aVthe project in the city in London.
p413
aVAnd this sequence shows the buildup of that model.
p414
aVBut what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting,
p415
aVis that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.
p416
aVWhat are the other ways of putting
p417
aVthe same amount of space on the site?
p418
aVIf, for example, you seek to do a building
p419
aVwhich goes right to the edge of the pavement,
p420
aVit's the same amount of space.
p421
aVAnd finally, you profile this, you cut grooves into it.
p422
aVThe grooves become the kind of green lungs
p423
aVwhich give views, which give light, ventilation,
p424
aVmake the building fresher.
p425
aVAnd you enclose that with something that also
p426
aVis central to its appearance,
p427
aVwhich is a mesh of triangulated structures \u2014
p428
aVagain, in a long connection evocative of
p429
aVsome of those works of Buckminster Fuller,
p430
aVand the way in which triangulation can increase performance
p431
aVand also give that building its sense of identity.
p432
aa(lp433
VAnd here, if we look at a detail of the way
p434
aVthat the building opens up and breathes into those atria,
p435
aVthe way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces,
p436
aVwe can see the high pressure, the low pressure,
p437
aVthe way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.
p438
aVSo it also has the ability, all the time,
p439
aVregardless of the direction of the wind,
p440
aVto be able to make the building fresh and efficient.
p441
aVAnd unlike conventional buildings,
p442
aVthe top of the building is celebratory.
p443
aVIt's a viewing place for people, not machinery.
p444
aVAnd the base of the building is again about public space.
p445
aVComparing it with a typical building,
p446
aVwhat happens if we seek to use such design strategies
p447
aVin terms of really large-scale thinking?
p448
aVAnd I'm just going to give two images
p449
aVout of a kind of company research project.
p450
aa(lp451
VIt's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.
p452
aVThe level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.
p453
aVAnd the Dead Sea is obviously much lower
p454
aVthan the oceans and seas around it.
p455
aVSo there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea
p456
aVby creating a pipeline, a pipe,
p457
aVsometimes above the surface, sometimes buried,
p458
aVthat will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba
p459
aVinto the Dead Sea.
p460
aVAnd our translation of that,
p461
aVusing a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say,
p462
aVwhat if that, instead of being just a pipe,
p463
aVwhat if it is a lifeline?
p464
aVWhat if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are,
p465
aVof the Grand Canal,
p466
aVin terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?
p467
aVIn other words, water is the lifeblood.
p468
aa(lp469
VAnd if you just go back to the previous image,
p470
aVand you look at this area of volatility and hostility,
p471
aVthat a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture
p472
aVcould have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together
p473
aVin a united cause, in terms of something that would be
p474
aVgenuinely green and productive in the widest sense.
p475
aVInfrastructure at that large scale is also
p476
aVinseparable from communication.
p477
aVAnd whether that communication is the virtual world
p478
aVor it is the physical world,
p479
aVthen it's absolutely central to society.
p480
aVAnd how do we make more legible in this growing world,
p481
aVespecially in some of the places that I'm talking about \u2014
p482
aVChina, for example, which in the next ten years
p483
aVwill create 400 new airports.
p484
aVNow what form do they take?
p485
aVHow do you make them more friendly at that scale?
p486
aa(lp487
VHong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age,
p488
aVbecause you always have a point of reference.
p489
aVSo what happens when we take that and you expand that further
p490
aVinto the Chinese society?
p491
aVAnd what is interesting is that that produces in a way
p492
aVperhaps the ultimate mega-building.
p493
aVIt is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.
p494
aV250 \u2014 excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.
p495
aVLarger by 17 percent than every terminal put together
p496
aVat Heathrow \u2014 built \u2014 plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.
p497
aVAnd the challenge here is a building that will be green,
p498
aVthat is compact despite its size
p499
aVand is about the human experience of travel,
p500
aVis about friendly, is coming back to that starting point,
p501
aVis very, very much about the lifestyle.
p502
aVAnd perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces.
p503
aa(lp504
VAs Hubert was talking over lunch,
p505
aVas we sort of engaged in conversation,
p506
aVtalked about this, talked about cities.
p507
aVHubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals."
p508
aVAnd in a way, one aspect of this conversation
p509
aVwas triggered on New Year's Eve,
p510
aVwhen I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China
p511
aVin terms of its green ambitions and aspirations.
p512
aVAnd I was voicing the thought that \u2014
p513
aVit just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve,
p514
aVa sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 \u2014
p515
aVthat maybe, you know, the future was
p516
aVthe most powerful, innovative sort of nation.
p517
aVThe way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say,
p518
aV"We put a man on the moon."
p519
aa(lp520
VYou know, who is going to say
p521
aVthat we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels,
p522
aVwith all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on.
p523
aVAnd that's a concerted platform.
p524
aVIt's more than one device, you know, it's renewable.
p525
aVAnd I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year,
p526
aVI thought that the inspiration was more likely
p527
aVto come from those other, larger countries out there \u2014
p528
aVthe Chinas, the Indias, the Asian-Pacific tigers.
p529
aVThank you very much.

VIt is very fashionable and proper  to speak about food
p5
aVin all its forms, all its colors,  aromas and tastes.
p6
aVBut after the food goes through  the digestive system,
p7
aVwhen it is thrown out as crap,
p8
aVit is no longer fashionable to speak about it.
p9
aVIt is rather revolting.
p10
aa(lp11
VI'm a guy who has graduated  from bullshit to full-shit.
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVMy organization, Gram Vikas, which means "village development organization,"
p14
aVwas working in the area  of renewable energy.
p15
aVOn the most part, we were  producing biogas,
p16
aVbiogas for rural kitchens.
p17
aVWe produce biogas in India  by using animal manure,
p18
aVwhich usually, in India,  is called cow dung.
p19
aVBut as the gender-sensitive  person that I am,
p20
aVI would like to call it bullshit.
p21
aVBut realizing later on
p22
aVhow important were sanitation and the disposal of crap in a proper way,
p23
aVwe went into the arena of sanitation.
p24
aVEighty percent of all diseases  in India and most developing countries
p25
aVare because of poor quality water.
p26
aVAnd when we look at the reason  for poor quality water,
p27
aVyou find that it is our abysmal attitude  to the disposal of human waste.
p28
aa(lp29
VHuman waste, in its rawest form,
p30
aVfinds its way back to drinking water, bathing water, washing water,
p31
aVirrigation water, whatever water you see.
p32
aVAnd this is the cause for 80 percent  of the diseases in rural areas.
p33
aVIn India, it is unfortunately only the women who carry water.
p34
aVSo for all domestic needs, women have to carry water.
p35
aVSo that is a pitiable state of affairs.
p36
aa(lp37
VOpen defecation is rampant.
p38
aVSeventy percent of India defecates in the open.
p39
aVThey sit there out in the open,
p40
aVwith the wind on their sails,
p41
aVhiding their faces, exposing their bases,
p42
aVand sitting there in pristine glory \u2014
p43
aV70 percent of India.
p44
aVAnd if you look at the world total,
p45
aV60 percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by Indians.
p46
aVA fantastic distinction.
p47
aVI don't know if we Indians can be proud of such a distinction.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VSo we, together with a lot of villages,
p51
aVwe began to talk about how to really  address this situation of sanitation.
p52
aVAnd we came together and formed  a project called MANTRA.
p53
aVMANTRA stands for Movement and Action Network for Transformation of Rural Areas.
p54
aVSo we are speaking about transformation, transformation in rural areas.
p55
aVVillages that agree  to implement this project,
p56
aVthey organize a legal society
p57
aVwhere the general body  consists of all members
p58
aVwho elect a group of men and women who implement the project
p59
aVand, later on, who look after the operation and maintenance.
p60
aVThey decide to build a toilet  and a shower room.
p61
aVAnd from a protected water source,
p62
aVwater will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households
p63
aVthrough three taps:
p64
aVone in the toilet, one in the shower,  one in the kitchen, 24 hours a day.
p65
aVThe pity is that our cities, like New Delhi and Bombay,
p66
aVdo not have a 24-hour water supply.
p67
aVBut in these villages, we want to have it.
p68
aa(lp69
VThere is a distinct difference  in the quality.
p70
aVWell in India, we have a theory, which is very much accepted
p71
aVby the government bureaucracy and all those who matter,
p72
aVthat poor people deserve poor solutions
p73
aVand absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions.
p74
aVThis, combined with  a Nobel Prize-worthy theory that
p75
aVthe cheapest is the most economic,
p76
aVis the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink.
p77
aVWe are fighting against this.
p78
aVWe feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries.
p79
aVAnd even in sanitation,
p80
aVthey should not be humiliated.
p81
aVSanitation is more about dignity
p82
aVthan about human disposal of waste.
p83
aVAnd so you build these toilets  and very often,
p84
aVwe have to hear that the toilets are better than their houses.
p85
aVAnd you can see that in front are  the attached houses
p86
aVand the others are the toilets.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo these people, without a single exception of a family in a village,
p89
aVdecide to build a toilet, a bathing room.
p90
aVAnd for that, they come together, collect all the local materials \u2014
p91
aVlocal materials like rubble,  sand, aggregates,
p92
aVusually a government subsidy is available
p93
aVto meet at least part of the cost  of external materials
p94
aVlike cement, steel, toilet commode.
p95
aVAnd they build a toilet  and a bathing room.
p96
aVAlso, all the unskilled laborers, that is  daily wage earners, mostly landless,
p97
aVare given an opportunity to be  trained as masons and plumbers.
p98
aVSo while these people are being trained,  others are collecting the materials.
p99
aVAnd when both are ready, they build a toilet, a shower room,
p100
aVand of course also a water tower,  an elevated water reservoir.
p101
aVWe use a system of two leach pits  to treat the waste.
p102
aVFrom the toilet, the muck comes into the first leach pit.
p103
aVAnd when it is full, it is blocked  and it can go to the next.
p104
aVBut we discovered that if you plant banana trees, papaya trees
p105
aVon the periphery of these leach pits,
p106
aVthey grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients
p107
aVand you get very tasty bananas, papayas.
p108
aVIf any of you come to my place,
p109
aVI would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you.
p110
aVSo there you can see  the completed toilets, the water towers.
p111
aa(lp112
VThis is in a village where  most of the people are even illiterate.
p113
aVIt is always a 24-hour water supply
p114
aVbecause water gets polluted very often when you store it \u2014
p115
aVa child dips his or her hand into it, something falls into it.
p116
aVSo no water is stored. It's always on tap.
p117
aVThis is how an elevated  water reservoir is constructed.
p118
aVAnd that is the end product.
p119
aVBecause it has to go high, and there is some space available,
p120
aVtwo or three rooms are made under the water tower,
p121
aVwhich are used by the village for  different committee meetings.
p122
aa(lp123
VWe have had clear evidence of the great impact of this program.
p124
aVBefore we started, there were, as usual,
p125
aVmore than 80 percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases.
p126
aVBut after this, we have empirical evidence that 82 percent, on average,
p127
aVamong all these villages \u2014 1,200 villages have completed it \u2014
p128
aVwaterborne diseases  have come down 82 percent.
p129
aV(Applause)
p130
aVWomen usually used to spend,  especially in the summer months,
p131
aVabout six to seven hours  a day carrying water.
p132
aVAnd when they went to carry water,
p133
aVbecause, as I said earlier, it's only women who carry water,
p134
aVthey used to take their little children, girl children, also to carry water,
p135
aVor else to be back at home to look after the siblings.
p136
aVSo there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school,
p137
aVeven if there was a school.
p138
aVAnd boys, about 30 percent.
p139
aVBut girls, it has gone to about 90 percent and boys, almost to 100 percent.
p140
aV(Applause)
p141
aVThe most vulnerable section in a village
p142
aVare the landless laborers who are the daily wage-earners.
p143
aVBecause they have gone  through this training
p144
aVto be masons and plumbers and bar benders,
p145
aVnow their ability to earn has  increased 300 to 400 percent.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo this is a democracy in action
p148
aVbecause there is a general body,  a governing board, the committee.
p149
aVPeople are questioning,  people are governing themselves,
p150
aVpeople are learning to manage their own affairs,
p151
aVthey are taking their own futures into their hands.
p152
aVAnd that is democracy at the grassroots level in action.
p153
aVMore than 1,200 villages  have so far done this.
p154
aVIt benefits over 400,000 people and it's still going on.
p155
aVAnd I hope it continues to move ahead.
p156
aa(lp157
VFor India and such developing countries,
p158
aVarmies and armaments,
p159
aVsoftware companies and spaceships
p160
aVmay not be as important as taps and toilets.
p161
aa(lp162
VThank you. Thank you very much.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Applause)
p165
aVThank you.

young workers to fight for better work conditions. They were employed by... his own father. He was therefore sent away to a boarding school. After his studies, travels across India, and participating in relief work afer a devastating cyclone, in 1979 he founded Gram Vikas. The name translates to &quot;village development&quot; in both Hindi and Oriya, the language of the state of Orissa, where the organization is primarily active. </p><p>The bulk of <a href=\\"http://www.gramvikas.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gram Vikas</a>&#39; efforts are on water and sanitation. The organization&#39;s approach is based on partnership with villagers and gender equity. In order to benefit from Gram Vikas&#39; support to install water and sanitation systems, the entire village community needs to commit to participate in the planning, construction and maintenance, and all villagers, regardless of social, economic or caste status, will have access to the same facilities. This requirement of 100 percent participation is difficult, Madiath acknowledges, but it leads to socially equitable and long-term solutions. Gram Vikas has already reached over 1,200 communities and over 400,000 people.</p>", "slug": "joe_madiath", "whotheyare": "Joe Madiath brings Indian villagers together around water and sanitation projects.", "whatotherssay": "I hope our government will realize that the poor should not be further humiliated by being given third rate facilities.

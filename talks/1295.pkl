VHow many of you had to fill out a web form
p5
aVwhere you've been asked to read
p6
aVa distorted sequence of characters like this?
p7
aVHow many of you found it really annoying?
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VOK, outstanding. So I invented that.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VOr I was one of the people who did it.
p16
aVThat thing is called a CAPTCHA.
p17
aVAnd it is there to make sure you, the entity filling out the form,
p18
aVare a human and not a computer program
p19
aVthat was written to submit the form millions of times.
p20
aVThe reason it works is because humans, at least non-visually-impaired humans,
p21
aVhave no trouble reading these distorted characters,
p22
aVwhereas programs can't do it as well yet.
p23
aVIn the case of Ticketmaster,
p24
aVthe reason you have to type these characters
p25
aVis to prevent scalpers from writing a program
p26
aVthat can buy millions of tickets, two at a time.
p27
aa(lp28
VCAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet.
p29
aVAnd since they're used so often,
p30
aVa lot of times the sequence of random characters shown to the user
p31
aVis not so fortunate.
p32
aVSo this is an example from the Yahoo registration page.
p33
aVThe random characters that happened to be shown to the user
p34
aVwere W, A, I, T, which, of course, spell a word.
p35
aVBut the best part is the message
p36
aVthat the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later.
p37
aa(lp38
V[Help! I've been waiting for over 20 minutes and nothing happens.]
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VThis person thought they needed to wait.
p43
aVThis, of course, is not as bad as this poor person.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VCAPTCHA Project is something that we did at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago,
p48
aVand it's been used everywhere.
p49
aVLet me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later,
p50
aVwhich is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA.
p51
aVThis is a project that we call reCAPTCHA,
p52
aVwhich is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon,
p53
aVthen we turned it into a start-up company.
p54
aVAnd then about a year and a half ago, Google actually acquired this company.
p55
aa(lp56
VLet me tell you what this project started.
p57
aVThis project started from the following realization:
p58
aVIt turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs
p59
aVare typed everyday by people around the world.
p60
aVWhen I first heard this, I was quite proud of myself.
p61
aVI thought, look at the impact my research has had.
p62
aVBut then I started feeling bad.
p63
aVHere's the thing: each time you type a CAPTCHA,
p64
aVessentially, you waste 10 seconds of your time.
p65
aVAnd if you multiply that by 200 million,
p66
aVyou get that humanity is wasting about 500,000 hours every day
p67
aVtyping these annoying CAPTCHAs.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VSo then I started feeling bad.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd then I started thinking, of course, we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs,
p76
aVbecause the security of the web depends on them.
p77
aVBut then I started thinking, can we use this effort
p78
aVfor something that is good for humanity?
p79
aVSo see, here's the thing.
p80
aVWhile you're typing a CAPTCHA, during those 10 seconds,
p81
aVyour brain is doing something amazing.
p82
aVYour brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do.
p83
aVSo can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds?
p84
aVIs there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve,
p85
aVyet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks
p86
aVsuch that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA,
p87
aVthey solve a little bit of this problem?
p88
aVAnd the answer to that is "yes," and this is what we're doing now.
p89
aa(lp90
VNowadays, while you're typing a CAPTCHA,
p91
aVnot only are you authenticating yourself as a human,
p92
aVbut in addition you're helping us to digitize books.
p93
aVLet me explain how this works.
p94
aVThere's a lot of projects trying to digitize books.
p95
aVGoogle has one. The Internet Archive has one.
p96
aVAmazon, with the Kindle, is trying to digitize books.
p97
aVBasically, the way this works is you start with an old book.
p98
aVYou've seen those things, right?
p99
aVLike a book?
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VSo you start with a book and then you scan it.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, scanning a book
p106
aVis like taking a digital photograph of every page.
p107
aVIt gives you an image for every page.
p108
aVThis is an image with text for every page of the book.
p109
aVThe next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able
p110
aVto decipher the words in this image.
p111
aVThat's using a technology called OCR, for optical character recognition,
p112
aVwhich takes a picture of text
p113
aVand tries to figure out what text is in there.
p114
aVNow, the problem is that OCR is not perfect.
p115
aVEspecially for older books
p116
aVwhere the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow,
p117
aVOCR cannot recognize a lot of the words.
p118
aVFor things that were written more than 50 years ago,
p119
aVthe computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words.
p120
aVSo now we're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize
p121
aVand we're getting people to read them for us
p122
aVwhile they're typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo the next time you type a CAPTCHA, these words that you're typing
p125
aVare actually words from books that are being digitized
p126
aVthat the computer could not recognize.
p127
aVThe reason we have two words nowadays instead of one
p128
aVis because one of the words
p129
aVis a word that the system just got out of a book,
p130
aVit didn't know what it was and it's going to present it to you.
p131
aVBut since it doesn't know the answer, it cannot grade it.
p132
aVSo we give you another word,
p133
aVfor which the system does know the answer.
p134
aVWe don't tell you which one's which and we say, please type both.
p135
aVAnd if you type the correct word
p136
aVfor the one for which the system knows the answer,
p137
aVit assumes you are human
p138
aVand it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly.
p139
aVAnd if we repeat this process to 10 different people
p140
aVand they agree on what the new word is,
p141
aVthen we get one more word digitized accurately.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo this is how the system works.
p144
aVAnd since we released it about three or four years ago,
p145
aVa lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA,
p146
aVwhere people wasted their time,
p147
aVto the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books.
p148
aVSo every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster,
p149
aVyou help to digitize a book.
p150
aVFacebook: Every time you add a friend or poke somebody,
p151
aVyou help to digitize a book.
p152
aVTwitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA.
p153
aVAnd the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high
p154
aVthat the number of words we're digitizing per day is really large.
p155
aVIt's about 100 million a day,
p156
aVwhich is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year.
p157
aVAnd this is all being done one word at a time
p158
aVby just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VNow, of course,
p163
aVsince we're doing so many words per day,
p164
aVfunny things can happen.
p165
aVThis is especially true because now we're giving people
p166
aVtwo randomly chosen English words next to each other.
p167
aVSo funny things can happen.
p168
aVFor example, we presented this word.
p169
aVIt's the word "Christians"; there's nothing wrong with it.
p170
aVBut if you present it along with another randomly chosen word,
p171
aVbad things can happen.
p172
aVSo we get this.
p173
aa(lp174
V[bad Christians]
p175
aa(lp176
VBut it's even worse, because the website where we showed this
p177
aVactually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VOops.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VHere's another really bad one.
p186
aVJohnEdwards.com
p187
aa(lp188
V[Damn liberal]
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VSo we keep on insulting people left and right everyday.
p193
aVOf course, we're not just insulting people.
p194
aVHere's the thing. Since we're presenting two randomly chosen words,
p195
aVinteresting things can happen.
p196
aVSo this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme
p197
aVthat tens of thousands of people have participated in,
p198
aVwhich is called CAPTCHA art.
p199
aVI'm sure some of you have heard about it.
p200
aVHere's how it works.
p201
aVImagine you're using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA
p202
aVthat you think is somewhat peculiar,
p203
aVlike this CAPTCHA.
p204
aa(lp205
V[invisible toaster]
p206
aa(lp207
VWhat you're supposed to do is you take a screenshot of it.
p208
aVThen of course, you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book.
p209
aVBut first you take a screenshot
p210
aVand then you draw something that is related to it.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VThat's how it works.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VThere are tens of thousands of these.
p219
aVSome of them are very cute.
p220
aa(lp221
V[clenched it]
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VSome of them are funnier.
p226
aa(lp227
V[stoned Founders]
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd some of them, like paleontological shvisle ...
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
Vthey contain Snoop Dogg.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VOK, so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA.
p240
aVSo this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project.
p241
aVThis is the number of distinct people
p242
aVthat have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA:
p243
aV750 million, a little over 10 percent of the world's population,
p244
aVhas helped us digitize human knowledge.
p245
aVAnd it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda.
p246
aVSo the question that motivates my research is the following:
p247
aVIf you look at humanity's large-scale achievements,
p248
aVthese really big things
p249
aVthat humanity has gotten together and done historically \u2014
p250
aVlike, for example, building the pyramids of Egypt
p251
aVor the Panama Canal
p252
aVor putting a man on the Moon \u2014
p253
aVthere is a curious fact about them,
p254
aVand it is that they were all done with about the same number of people.
p255
aVIt's weird; they were all done with about 100,000 people.
p256
aVAnd the reason for that is because, before the Internet,
p257
aVcoordinating more than 100,000 people,
p258
aVlet alone paying them, was essentially impossible.
p259
aVBut now with the Internet, I've just shown you a project
p260
aVwhere we've gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge.
p261
aVSo the question that motivates my research is,
p262
aVif we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000,
p263
aVwhat can we do with 100 million?
p264
aa(lp265
VSo based on this question,
p266
aVwe've had a lot of different projects that we've been working on.
p267
aVLet me tell you about one that I'm most excited about.
p268
aVThis is something that we've been semiquietly working on
p269
aVfor the last year and a half or so.
p270
aVIt hasn't yet been launched. It's called Duolingo.
p271
aVSince it hasn't been launched, shhh!
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VYeah, I can trust you'll do that.
p276
aVSo this is the project. Here's how it started.
p277
aVIt started with me posing a question to my graduate student, Severin Hacker.
p278
aVOK, that's Severin Hacker.
p279
aVSo I posed the question to my graduate student.
p280
aVBy the way, you did hear me correctly; his last name is Hacker.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VSo I posed this question to him: How can we get 100 million people
p285
aVtranslating the web into every major language for free?
p286
aVThere's a lot of things to say about this question.
p287
aVFirst of all, translating the web.
p288
aVRight now, the web is partitioned into multiple languages.
p289
aVA large fraction of it is in English.
p290
aVIf you don't know English, you can't access it.
p291
aVBut there's large fractions in other different languages,
p292
aVand if you don't know them, you can't access it.
p293
aVSo I would like to translate all of the web,
p294
aVor at least most of it, into every major language.
p295
aVThat's what I would like to do.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow, some of you may say, why can't we use computers to translate?
p298
aVMachine translation is starting to translate
p299
aVsome sentences here and there.
p300
aVWhy can't we use it to translate the web?
p301
aVThe problem with that is it's not yet good enough
p302
aVand it probably won't be for the next 15 to 20 years.
p303
aVIt makes a lot of mistakes. Even when it doesn't,
p304
aVsince it makes so many mistakes, you don't know whether to trust it or not.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo let me show you an example
p307
aVof something that was translated with a machine.
p308
aVActually, it was a forum post.
p309
aVIt was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript.
p310
aVIt was translated from Japanese into English.
p311
aVSo I'll just let you read.
p312
aVThis person starts apologizing
p313
aVfor the fact that it's translated with a computer.
p314
aVSo the next sentence is going to be the preamble to the question.
p315
aVSo he's just explaining something.
p316
aVRemember, it's a question about JavaScript.
p317
aa(lp318
V[At often, the goat-time install a error is vomit.]
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VThen comes the first part of the question.
p323
aa(lp324
V[How many times like the wind, a pole, and the dragon?]
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
VThen comes my favorite part of the question.
p329
aa(lp330
V[This insult to father's stones?]
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VAnd then comes the ending,
p335
aVwhich is my favorite part of the whole thing.
p336
aa(lp337
V[Please apologize for your stupidity. There are a many thank you.]
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VOK, so computer translation, not yet good enough.
p342
aVSo back to the question.
p343
aVSo we need people to translate the whole web.
p344
aVSo now the next question you may have is,
p345
aVwell, why can't we just pay people to do this?
p346
aVWe could pay professional translators to translate the whole web.
p347
aVWe could do that.
p348
aVUnfortunately, it would be extremely expensive.
p349
aVFor example, translating a tiny fraction of the whole web, Wikipedia,
p350
aVinto one other language, Spanish.
p351
aVOK? Wikipedia exists in Spanish,
p352
aVbut it's very small compared to the size of English.
p353
aVIt's about 20 percent of the size of English.
p354
aVIf we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish,
p355
aVit would cost at least 50 million dollars \u2014
p356
aVand this is even at the most exploited, outsourcing country out there.
p357
aVSo it would be very expensive.
p358
aVSo what we want to do is, we want to get 100 million people
p359
aVtranslating the web into every major language for free.
p360
aa(lp361
VIf this is what you want to do, you quickly realize
p362
aVyou're going to run into two big hurdles, two big obstacles.
p363
aVThe first one is a lack of bilinguals.
p364
aVSo I don't even know
p365
aVif there exists 100 million people out there using the web
p366
aVwho are bilingual enough to help us translate.
p367
aVThat's a big problem.
p368
aVThe other problem you're going to run into is a lack of motivation.
p369
aVHow are we going to motivate people to actually translate the web for free?
p370
aVNormally, you have to pay people to do this.
p371
aVSo how are we going to motivate them to do it for free?
p372
aVWhen we were starting to think about this, we were blocked by these two things.
p373
aVBut then we realized, there's a way
p374
aVto solve both these problems with the same solution.
p375
aVTo kill two birds with one stone.
p376
aVAnd that is to transform language translation
p377
aVinto something that millions of people want to do
p378
aVand that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals,
p379
aVand that is language education.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo it turns out that today,
p382
aVthere are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language.
p383
aVPeople really want to learn a foreign language.
p384
aVAnd it's not just because they're being forced to do so in school.
p385
aVIn the US alone, there are over five million people
p386
aVwho have paid over $500 for software to learn a new language.
p387
aVSo people really want to learn a new language.
p388
aVSo what we've been working on for the last year and a half
p389
aVis a new website \u2014 it's called Duolingo \u2014
p390
aVwhere the basic idea is people learn a new language for free
p391
aVwhile simultaneously translating the web.
p392
aVAnd so basically, they're learning by doing.
p393
aa(lp394
VSo the way this works
p395
aVis whenever you're a just a beginner, we give you very simple sentences.
p396
aVThere's a lot of very simple sentences on the web.
p397
aVWe give you very simple sentences along with what each word means.
p398
aVAnd as you translate them
p399
aVand as you see how other people translate them,
p400
aVyou start learning the language.
p401
aVAnd as you get more advanced,
p402
aVwe give you more complex sentences to translate.
p403
aVBut at all times, you're learning by doing.
p404
aa(lp405
VNow, the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works.
p406
aVPeople are really learning a language.
p407
aVWe're mostly done building it and now we're testing it.
p408
aVPeople really can learn a language with it.
p409
aVAnd they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software.
p410
aVSo people really do learn a language.
p411
aVAnd not only do they learn it as well, but actually it's more interesting.
p412
aVBecause with Duolingo, people are learning with real content.
p413
aVAs opposed to learning with made-up sentences,
p414
aVpeople are learning with real content, which is inherently interesting.
p415
aVSo people really do learn a language.
p416
aa(lp417
VBut perhaps more surprisingly,
p418
aVthe translations that we get from people using the site,
p419
aVeven though they're just beginners,
p420
aVthe translations that we get
p421
aVare as accurate as those of professional language translators,
p422
aVwhich is very surprising.
p423
aVSo let me show you one example.
p424
aVThis is a sentence that was translated from German into English.
p425
aVThe top is the German. The middle is an English translation
p426
aVthat was done by a professional translator
p427
aVwho we paid 20 cents a word for this translation.
p428
aVAnd the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo,
p429
aVnone of whom knew any German before they started using the site.
p430
aVIf you can see, it's pretty much perfect.
p431
aVOf course, we play a trick here
p432
aVto make the translations as good as professional language translators.
p433
aVWe combine the translations of multiple beginners
p434
aVto get the quality of a single professional translator.
p435
aa(lp436
VNow, even though we're combining the translations,
p437
aVthe site actually can translate pretty fast.
p438
aVSo let me show you,
p439
aVthis is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia
p440
aVfrom English into Spanish.
p441
aVRemember, this is 50 million dollars' worth of value.
p442
aVSo if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish,
p443
aVwe could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users.
p444
aVAnd we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users.
p445
aVSince all the projects my group has worked on so far
p446
aVhave gotten millions of users,
p447
aVwe're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast.
p448
aa(lp449
VNow, the thing that I'm most excited about with Duolingo
p450
aVis I think this provides a fair business model for language education.
p451
aVSo here's the thing:
p452
aVThe current business model for language education
p453
aVis the student pays,
p454
aVand in particular, the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars.
p455
aa(lp456
V(Laughter)
p457
aa(lp458
VThat's the current business model.
p459
aVThe problem with this business model

aVis that 95 percent of the world's population doesn't have 500 dollars.
p461
aVSo it's extremely unfair towards the poor.
p462
aVThis is totally biased towards the rich.
p463
aVNow, see, in Duolingo,
p464
aVbecause while you learn, you're actually creating value,
p465
aVyou're translating stuff \u2014
p466
aVwhich, for example, we could charge somebody for translations,
p467
aVso this is how we could monetize this.
p468
aVSince people are creating value while they're learning,
p469
aVthey don't have to pay with their money, they pay with their time.
p470
aVBut the magical thing here
p471
aVis that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways
p472
aVlearning the language.
p473
aVSo the nice thing about Duolingo
p474
aVis, I think, it provides a fair business model \u2014
p475
aVone that doesn't discriminate against poor people.
p476
aa(lp477
VSo here's the site. Thank you.

VWe haven't yet launched,
p482
aVbut if you go there, you can sign up to be part of our private beta,
p483
aVwhich is probably going to start in three or four weeks.
p484
aVWe haven't yet launched it.
p485
aa(lp486
VBy the way, I'm the one talking here,
p487
aVbut Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team,
p488
aa(lp489

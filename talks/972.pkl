VI want to talk to you today about prosperity,
p5
aVabout our hopes
p6
aVfor a shared and lasting prosperity.
p7
aVAnd not just us,
p8
aVbut the two billion people worldwide
p9
aVwho are still chronically undernourished.
p10
aVAnd hope actually is at the heart of this.
p11
aVIn fact, the Latin word for hope
p12
aVis at the heart of the word prosperity.
p13
aV"Pro-speras," "speras," hope \u2014
p14
aVin accordance with our hopes and expectations.
p15
aVThe irony is, though,
p16
aVthat we have cashed-out prosperity
p17
aValmost literally in terms of money and economic growth.
p18
aVAnd we've grown our economies so much
p19
aVthat we now stand
p20
aVin a real danger
p21
aVof undermining hope \u2014
p22
aVrunning down resources, cutting down rainforests,
p23
aVspilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico,
p24
aVchanging the climate \u2014
p25
aVand the only thing that has actually
p26
aVremotely slowed down the relentless rise
p27
aVof carbon emissions over the last two to three decades
p28
aVis recession.
p29
aVAnd recession, of course,
p30
aVisn't exactly a recipe for hope either,
p31
aVas we're busy finding out.
p32
aVSo we're caught in a kind of trap.
p33
aVIt's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth.
p34
aVWe can't live with it; we can't live without it.
p35
aVTrash the system or crash the planet \u2014
p36
aVit's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice.
p37
aVAnd our best avenue of escape from this actually
p38
aVis a kind of blind faith
p39
aVin our own cleverness and technology and efficiency
p40
aVand doing things more efficiently.
p41
aVNow I haven't got anything against efficiency.
p42
aVAnd I think we are a clever species sometimes.
p43
aVBut I think we should also just check the numbers,
p44
aVtake a reality check here.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo I want you to imagine a world,
p47
aVin 2050, of around nine billion people,
p48
aVall aspiring to Western incomes,
p49
aVWestern lifestyles.
p50
aVAnd I want to ask the question \u2014
p51
aVand we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well,
p52
aVbecause we believe in growth.
p53
aVAnd I want to ask the question:
p54
aVhow far and how fast would be have to move?
p55
aVHow clever would we have to be?
p56
aVHow much technology would we need in this world
p57
aVto deliver our carbon targets?
p58
aVAnd here in my chart \u2014
p59
aVon the left-hand side is where we are now.
p60
aVThis is the carbon intensity of economic growth
p61
aVin the economy at the moment.
p62
aVIt's around about 770 grams of carbon.
p63
aVIn the world I describe to you,
p64
aVwe have to be right over here at the right-hand side
p65
aVat six grams of carbon.
p66
aVIt's a 130-fold improvement,
p67
aVand that is 10 times further and faster
p68
aVthan anything we've ever achieved in industrial history.
p69
aVMaybe we can do it, maybe it's possible \u2014 who knows?
p70
aVMaybe we can even go further
p71
aVand get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere,
p72
aVwhich is what we're going to need to be doing
p73
aVby the end of the century.
p74
aVBut shouldn't we just check first
p75
aVthat the economic system that we have
p76
aVis remotely capable of delivering
p77
aVthis kind of improvement?
p78
aa(lp79
VSo I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics.
p80
aVIt's a bit complex, and I apologize for that.
p81
aVWhat I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it
p82
aVis sort of human terms.
p83
aVSo it looks a little bit like this.
p84
aVFirms produce goods for households \u2014 that's us \u2014
p85
aVand provide us with incomes,
p86
aVand that's even better, because we can spend those incomes
p87
aVon more goods and services.
p88
aVThat's called the circular flow of the economy.
p89
aVIt looks harmless enough.
p90
aVI just want to highlight one key feature of this system,
p91
aVwhich is the role of investment.
p92
aVNow investment constitutes
p93
aVonly about a fifth of the national income
p94
aVin most modern economies,
p95
aVbut it plays an absolutely vital role.
p96
aVAnd what it does essentially
p97
aVis to stimulate further consumption growth.
p98
aVIt does this in a couple of ways \u2014
p99
aVchasing productivity,
p100
aVwhich drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff.
p101
aVBut I want to concentrate
p102
aVon the role of investment
p103
aVin seeking out novelty,
p104
aVthe production and consumption of novelty.
p105
aVJoseph Schumpeter called this
p106
aV"the process of creative destruction."
p107
aVIt's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty,
p108
aVcontinually chasing expanding consumer markets,
p109
aVconsumer goods, new consumer goods.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd this, this is where it gets interesting,
p112
aVbecause it turns out that human beings
p113
aVhave something of an appetite for novelty.
p114
aVWe love new stuff \u2014
p115
aVnew material stuff for sure \u2014
p116
aVbut also new ideas, new adventures,
p117
aVnew experiences.
p118
aVBut the materiality matters too,
p119
aVbecause in every society
p120
aVthat anthropologists have looked at,
p121
aVmaterial stuff
p122
aVoperates as a kind of language \u2014
p123
aVa language of goods,
p124
aVa symbolic language
p125
aVthat we use to tell each other stories \u2014
p126
aVstories, for example,
p127
aVabout how important we are.
p128
aVStatus-driven, conspicuous consumption
p129
aVthrives from the language
p130
aVof novelty.
p131
aVAnd here, all of a sudden,
p132
aVwe have a system
p133
aVthat is locking economic structure with social logic \u2014
p134
aVthe economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together
p135
aVto drive an engine of growth.
p136
aVAnd this engine is not just economic value;
p137
aVit is pulling material resources
p138
aVrelentlessly through the system,
p139
aVdriven by our own insatiable appetites,
p140
aVdriven in fact by a sense of anxiety.
p141
aVAdam Smith, 200 years ago,
p142
aVspoke about our desire
p143
aVfor a life without shame.
p144
aVA life without shame:
p145
aVin his day, what that meant was a linen shirt,
p146
aVand today, well, you still need the shirt,
p147
aVbut you need the hybrid car,
p148
aVthe HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun,
p149
aVthe netbook and iPad, the list goes on \u2014
p150
aVan almost inexhaustible supply of goods,
p151
aVdriven by this anxiety.
p152
aVAnd even if we don't want them,
p153
aVwe need to buy them,
p154
aVbecause, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.
p155
aVAnd to stop it crashing
p156
aVover the last two to three decades,
p157
aVwe've expanded the money supply,
p158
aVexpanded credit and debt,
p159
aVso that people can keep buying stuff.
p160
aVAnd of course, that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut this \u2014 I just want to show you some data here.
p163
aVThis is what it looks like, essentially,
p164
aVthis credit and debt system, just for the U.K.
p165
aVThis was the last 15 years before the crash,
p166
aVand you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically.
p167
aVIt was above the GDP for three years in a row
p168
aVjust before the crisis.
p169
aVAnd in the mean time, personal savings absolutely plummeted.
p170
aVThe savings ratio, net savings,
p171
aVwere below zero in the middle of 2008,
p172
aVjust before the crash.
p173
aVThis is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings,
p174
aVjust to stay in the game.
p175
aVThis is a strange, rather perverse, story,
p176
aVjust to put it in very simple terms.
p177
aVIt's a story about us, people,
p178
aVbeing persuaded
p179
aVto spend money we don't have
p180
aVon things we don't need
p181
aVto create impressions that won't last
p182
aVon people we don't care about.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
V(Applause)
p187
aa(lp188
VBut before we consign ourselves to despair,
p189
aVmaybe we should just go back and say, "Did we get this right?
p190
aVIs this really how people are?
p191
aVIs this really how economies behave?"
p192
aVAnd almost straightaway
p193
aVwe actually run up against a couple of anomalies.
p194
aVThe first one is in the crisis itself.
p195
aVIn the crisis, in the recession, what do people want to do?
p196
aVThey want to hunker down, they want to look to the future.
p197
aVThey want to spend less and save more.
p198
aVBut saving is exactly the wrong thing to do
p199
aVfrom the system point of view.
p200
aVKeynes called this the "paradox of thrift" \u2014
p201
aVsaving slows down recovery.
p202
aVAnd politicians call on us continually
p203
aVto draw down more debt,
p204
aVto draw down our own savings even further,
p205
aVjust so that we can get the show back on the road,
p206
aVso we can keep this growth-based economy going.
p207
aVIt's an anomaly,
p208
aVit's a place where the system actually is at odds
p209
aVwith who we are as people.
p210
aa(lp211
VHere's another one \u2014 completely different one:
p212
aVWhy is it
p213
aVthat we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do
p214
aVto combat climate change,
p215
aVvery, very simple things
p216
aVlike buying energy-efficient appliances,
p217
aVputting in efficient lights, turning the lights off occasionally,
p218
aVinsulating our homes?
p219
aVThese things save carbon, they save energy,
p220
aVthey save us money.
p221
aVSo is it that, though they make perfect economic sense,
p222
aVwe don't do them?
p223
aVWell, I had my own personal insight into this
p224
aVa few years ago.
p225
aVIt was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon,
p226
aVand it was just after \u2014
p227
aVactually, to be honest, too long after \u2014
p228
aVwe had moved into a new house.
p229
aVAnd I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping,
p230
aVinstalling insulation around the windows and doors
p231
aVto keep out the drafts.
p232
aVAnd my, then, five year-old daughter
p233
aVwas helping me in the way that five year-olds do.
p234
aVAnd we'd been doing this for a while,
p235
aVwhen she turned to me very solemnly and said,
p236
aV"Will this really keep out the giraffes?"
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aV"Here they are, the giraffes."
p239
aVYou can hear the five-year-old mind working.
p240
aVThese ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here
p241
aVoutside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.
p242
aVGoodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather.
p243
aVBut actually that childish misrepresentation
p244
aVstuck with me,
p245
aVbecause it suddenly became clear to me
p246
aVwhy we don't do the blindingly obvious things.
p247
aVWe're too busy keeping out the giraffes \u2014
p248
aVputting the kids on the bus in the morning,
p249
aVgetting ourselves to work on time,
p250
aVsurviving email overload
p251
aVand shop floor politics,
p252
aVforaging for groceries, throwing together meals,
p253
aVescaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening
p254
aVinto prime-time TV
p255
aVor TED online,
p256
aVgetting from one end of the day to the other,
p257
aVkeeping out the giraffes.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VWhat is the objective?
p262
aV"What is the objective of the consumer?"
p263
aVMary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty
p264
aVwritten 35 years ago.
p265
aV"It is," she said,
p266
aV"to help create the social world
p267
aVand find a credible place in it."
p268
aVThat is a deeply humanizing
p269
aVvision of our lives,
p270
aVand it's a completely different vision
p271
aVthan the one that lies at the heart
p272
aVof this economic model.
p273
aVSo who are we?
p274
aVWho are these people?
p275
aVAre we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic,
p276
aVselfish individuals?
p277
aVOr might we actually occasionally be
p278
aVsomething like the selfless altruist
p279
aVdepicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here?
p280
aVWell psychology actually says
p281
aVthere is a tension \u2014
p282
aVa tension between self-regarding behaviors
p283
aVand other regarding behaviors.
p284
aVAnd these tensions have deep evolutionary roots,
p285
aVso selfish behavior
p286
aVis adaptive in certain circumstances \u2014
p287
aVfight or flight.
p288
aa(lp289
VBut other regarding behaviors
p290
aVare essential to our evolution
p291
aVas social beings.
p292
aVAnd perhaps even more interesting from our point of view,
p293
aVanother tension between novelty-seeking behaviors
p294
aVand tradition or conservation.
p295
aVNovelty is adaptive when things are changing
p296
aVand you need to adapt yourself.
p297
aVTradition is essential to lay down the stability
p298
aVto raise families and form cohesive social groups.
p299
aVSo here, all of a sudden,
p300
aVwe're looking at a map of the human heart.
p301
aVAnd it reveals to us, suddenly,
p302
aVthe crux of the matter.
p303
aVWhat we've done is we've created economies.
p304
aVWe've created systems,
p305
aVwhich systematically privilege, encourage,
p306
aVone narrow quadrant
p307
aVof the human soul
p308
aVand left the others unregarded.
p309
aVAnd in the same token, the solution becomes clear,
p310
aVbecause this isn't, therefore,
p311
aVabout changing human nature.
p312
aVIt isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities.
p313
aVIt is about opening up.
p314
aVIt is about allowing ourselves the freedom
p315
aVto become fully human,
p316
aVrecognizing the depth and the breadth
p317
aVof the human psyche
p318
aVand building institutions
p319
aVto protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within.
p320
aa(lp321
VWhat does all this mean for economics?
p322
aVWhat would economies look like
p323
aVif we took that vision of human nature
p324
aVat their heart
p325
aVand stretched them
p326
aValong these orthogonal dimensions
p327
aVof the human psyche?
p328
aVWell, it might look a little bit
p329
aVlike the 4,000 community-interest companies
p330
aVthat have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years
p331
aVand a similar rise in B corporations in the United States,
p332
aVenterprises
p333
aVthat have ecological and social goals
p334
aVwritten into their constitution
p335
aVat their heart \u2014
p336
aVcompanies, in fact, like this one, Ecosia.
p337
aVAnd I just want to, very quickly, show you this.
p338
aVEcosia is an Internet search engine.
p339
aVInternet search engines work
p340
aVby drawing revenues from sponsored links
p341
aVthat appear when you do a search.
p342
aVAnd Ecosia works in pretty much the same way.
p343
aVSo we can do that here \u2014
p344
aVwe can just put in a little search term.
p345
aVThere you go, Oxford, that's where we are. See what comes up.
p346
aVThe difference with Ecosia though
p347
aVis that, in Ecosia's case,
p348
aVit draws the revenues in the same way,
p349
aVbut it allocates
p350
aV80 percent of those revenues
p351
aVto a rainforest protection project in the Amazon.
p352
aVAnd we're going to do it.
p353
aVWe're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.
p354
aVIn case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession,
p355
aVthat's the page to go to.
p356
aVAnd what happened then was
p357
aVthe sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia,
p358
aVand Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues
p359
aVto a rainforest protection project.
p360
aVIt's taking profits from one place
p361
aVand allocating them
p362
aVinto the protection of ecological resources.
p363
aa(lp364
VIt's a different kind of enterprise
p365
aVfor a new economy.
p366
aVIt's a form, if you like,
p367
aVof ecological altruism \u2014
p368
aVperhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that.
p369
aVWhatever it is,
p370
aVwhatever this new economy is,
p371
aVwhat we need the economy to do, in fact,
p372
aVis to put investment
p373
aVback into the heart of the model,
p374
aVto re-conceive investment.
p375
aVOnly now, investment
p376
aVisn't going to be
p377
aVabout the relentless and mindless
p378
aVpursuit of consumption growth.
p379
aVInvestment has to be a different beast.
p380
aVInvestment has to be,
p381
aVin the new economy,
p382
aVprotecting and nurturing
p383
aVthe ecological assets on which our future depends.
p384
aVIt has to be about transition.
p385
aVIt has to be investing in low-carbon technologies
p386
aVand infrastructures.
p387
aVWe have to invest, in fact,
p388
aVin the idea of a meaningful prosperity,
p389
aVproviding capabilities
p390
aVfor people to flourish.
p391
aa(lp392
VAnd of course, this task has material dimensions.
p393
aVIt would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing
p394
aVif they didn't have food, clothing and shelter.
p395
aVBut it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this.
p396
aVIt has social and psychological aims \u2014
p397
aVfamily, friendship,
p398
aVcommitments, society,
p399
aVparticipating in the life of that society.
p400
aVAnd this too
p401
aVrequires investment,
p402
aVinvestment \u2014 for example, in places \u2014
p403
aVplaces where we can connect,
p404
aVplaces where we can participate,
p405
aVshared spaces,
p406
aVconcert halls, gardens,
p407
aVpublic parks,
p408
aVlibraries, museums, quiet centers,
p409
aVplaces of joy and celebration,
p410
aVplaces of tranquility and contemplation,
p411
aVsites for the "cultivation
p412
aVof a common citizenship,"
p413
aVin Michael Sandel's lovely phrase.
p414
aVAn investment \u2014 investment, after all, is just such a basic economic concept \u2014
p415
aVis nothing more nor less
p416
aVthan a relationship
p417
aVbetween the present and the future,
p418
aVa shared present and a common future.
p419
aVAnd we need that relationship to reflect,
p420
aVto reclaim hope.
p421
aa(lp422
VSo let me come back, with this sense of hope,
p423
aVto the two billion people
p424
aVstill trying to live each day
p425
aVon less than the price of a skinny latte
p426
aVfrom the cafe next door.
p427
aVWhat can we offer those people?
p428
aVIt's clear that we have a responsibility
p429
aVto help lift them out of poverty.
p430
aVIt's clear that we have a responsibility
p431
aVto make room for growth
p432
aVwhere growth really matters in those poorest nations.
p433
aVAnd it's also clear that we will never achieve that
p434
aVunless we're capable of redefining
p435
aVa meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations,
p436
aVa prosperity that is more meaningful
p437
aVand less materialistic
p438
aVthan the growth-based model.
p439
aVSo this is not just
p440
aVa Western post-materialist fantasy.
p441
aVIn fact, an African philosopher wrote to me,
p442
aVwhen "Prosperity Without Growth" was published,
p443
aVpointing out the similarities
p444
aVbetween this view of prosperity
p445
aVand the traditional African concept of ubuntu.
p446
aVUbuntu says, "I am
p447
aVbecause we are."
p448
aVProsperity is a shared endeavor.
p449
aVIts roots are long and deep \u2014
p450
aVits foundations, I've tried to show,
p451
aVexist already, inside each of us.
p452
aVSo this is not about
p453
aVstanding in the way of development.
p454
aVIt's not about
p455
aVoverthrowing capitalism.
p456
aVIt's not about
p457
aVtrying to change human nature.
p458
aVWhat we're doing here
p459
aVis we're taking a few simple steps
p460
aVtowards an economics fit for purpose.
p461
aVAnd at the heart of that economics,
p462
aVwe're placing a more credible,
p463
aVmore robust,
p464
aVand more realistic vision
p465
aVof what it means to be human.
p466
aa(lp467
VThank you very much.
p468
aa(lp469
V(Applause)
p470
aa(lp471
VChris Anderson: While they're taking the podium away, just a quick question.
p472
aVFirst of all, economists aren't supposed to be inspiring,
p473
aVso you may need to work on the tone a little.
p474
aV(Laughter)
p475
aVCan you picture the politicians ever buying into this?

aVI mean, can you picture
p477
aVa politician standing up in Britain and saying,
p478
aV"GDP fell two percent this year. Good news!
p479
aVWe're actually all happier, and a country's more beautiful,
p480
aVand our lives are better."
p481
aa(lp482
VTim Jackson: Well that's clearly not what you're doing.
p483
aVYou're not making news out of things falling down.
p484
aVYou're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing.
p485
aVCan I picture politicians doing it?
p486
aVActually, I already am seeing a little bit of it.
p487
aVWhen we first started this kind of work,
p488
aVpoliticians would stand up, treasury spokesmen would stand up,
p489
aVand accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves.
p490
aVAnd actually in the period
p491
aVthrough which we've been working over the last 18 years \u2014
p492
aVpartly because of the financial crisis
p493
aVand a little bit of humility in the profession of economics \u2014
p494
aVactually people are engaging in this issue
p495
aVin all sorts of countries around the world.
p496
aa(lp497
VCA: But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together,
p498
aVor is it going to be more just civil society and companies?
p499
aa(lp500
VTJ: It has to be companies. It has to be civil society.
p501
aVBut it has to have political leadership.
p502
aVThis is a kind of agenda,
p503
aVwhich actually politicians themselves
p504
aVare kind of caught in that dilemma,
p505
aVbecause they're hooked on the growth model themselves.
p506
aVBut actually opening up the space
p507
aVto think about different ways of governing,
p508
aVdifferent kinds of politics,
p509
aVand creating the space
p510
aVfor civil society and businesses to operate differently \u2014
p511
aVabsolutely vital.
p512
aa(lp513
VCA: And if someone could convince you
p514
aVthat we actually can make the \u2014 what was it? \u2014
p515
aVthe 130-fold improvement in efficiency,
p516
aVof reduction of carbon footprint,
p517
aVwould you then actually like that picture of economic growth
p518
aVinto more knowledge-based goods?
p519
aa(lp520
VTJ: I would still want to know that you could do that
p521
aVand get below zero by the end of the century,
p522
aVin terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere,
p523
aVand solve the problem of biodiversity
p524
aVand reduce the impact on land use
p525
aVand do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water.
p526
aVIf you can convince me we can do all that,
p527
aVthen, yes, I would take the two percent.
p528
aa(lp529
VCA: Tim, thank you for a very important talk. Thank you.

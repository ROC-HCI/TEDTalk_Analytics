VI'm going to talk to you
p5
aVabout power in this 21st century.
p6
aVAnd basically, what I'd like to tell you
p7
aVis that power is changing,
p8
aVand there are two types of changes
p9
aVI want to discuss.
p10
aVOne is power transition,
p11
aVwhich is change of power amongst states.
p12
aVAnd there the simple version of the message
p13
aVis it's moving from West to East.
p14
aVThe other is power diffusion,
p15
aVthe way power is moving
p16
aVfrom all states West or East
p17
aVto non-state actors.
p18
aVThose two things
p19
aVare the huge shifts of power
p20
aVin our century.
p21
aVAnd I want to tell you about them each separately
p22
aVand then how they interact
p23
aVand why, in the end, there may be some good news.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhen we talk about power transition,
p26
aVwe often talk about the rise of Asia.
p27
aVIt really should be called
p28
aVthe recovery or return of Asia.
p29
aVIf we looked at the world
p30
aVin 1800,
p31
aVyou'd find that more than half of the world's people
p32
aVlived in Asia
p33
aVand they made more than half the world's product.
p34
aVNow fast forward to 1900:
p35
aVhalf the world's people \u2014 more than half \u2014 still live in Asia,
p36
aVbut they're now making
p37
aVonly a fifth of the world's product.
p38
aVWhat happened? The Industrial Revolution,
p39
aVwhich meant that all of a sudden,
p40
aVEurope and America
p41
aVbecame the dominant center of the world.
p42
aVWhat we're going to see in the 21st century
p43
aVis Asia gradually returning
p44
aVto being more than half of the world's population
p45
aVand more than half of the world's product.
p46
aVThat's important and it's an important shift.
p47
aVBut let me tell you a little bit about
p48
aVthe other shift that I'm talking about,
p49
aVwhich is power diffusion.
p50
aa(lp51
VTo understand power diffusion
p52
aVput this in your mind:
p53
aVcomputing and communications costs
p54
aVhave fallen a thousandfold
p55
aVbetween 1970
p56
aVand the beginning of this century.
p57
aVNow that's a big abstract number.
p58
aVBut to make it more real,
p59
aVif the price of an automobile
p60
aVhad fallen as rapidly
p61
aVas the price of computing power,
p62
aVyou could buy a car today
p63
aVfor five dollars.
p64
aVNow when the price of any technology
p65
aVdeclines that dramatically,
p66
aVthe barriers to entry go down.
p67
aVAnybody can play in the game.
p68
aVSo in 1970,
p69
aVif you wanted to communicate
p70
aVfrom Oxford to Johannesburg
p71
aVto New Delhi
p72
aVto Brasilia
p73
aVand anywhere simultaneously,
p74
aVyou could do it.
p75
aVThe technology was there.
p76
aVBut to be able to do it,
p77
aVyou had to be very rich \u2014
p78
aVa government, a multinational corporation,
p79
aVmaybe the Catholic Church \u2014
p80
aVbut you had to be pretty wealthy.
p81
aVNow, anybody has that capacity,
p82
aVwhich previously was restricted by price
p83
aVjust to a few actors.
p84
aVIf they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe \u2014
p85
aVthe last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour \u2014
p86
aVand if you have Skype, it's free.
p87
aVSo capabilities
p88
aVthat were once restricted
p89
aVare now available to everyone.
p90
aVAnd what that means
p91
aa(lp92
Vis not that the age of the State is over.
p93
aVThe State still matters.
p94
aVBut the stage is crowded.
p95
aVThe State's not alone. There are many, many actors.
p96
aVSome of that's good:
p97
aVOxfam,
p98
aVa great non-governmental actor.
p99
aVSome of it's bad:
p100
aVAl Qaeda, another non-governmental actor.
p101
aVBut think of what it does
p102
aVto how we think in traditional terms and concepts.
p103
aVWe think in terms of war
p104
aVand interstate war.
p105
aVAnd you can think back to 1941
p106
aVwhen the government of Japan
p107
aVattacked the United States at Pearl Harbor.
p108
aVIt's worth noticing
p109
aVthat a non-state actor
p110
aVattacking the United States in 2001
p111
aVkilled more Americans
p112
aVthan the government of Japan did in 1941.
p113
aVYou might think of that
p114
aVas the privatization of war.
p115
aVSo we're seeing a great change
p116
aVin terms of diffusion of power.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow the problem is
p119
aVthat we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways.
p120
aVSo let me step back
p121
aVand ask: what's power?
p122
aVPower is simple the ability
p123
aVto affect others
p124
aVto get the outcomes you want,
p125
aVand you can do it in three ways.
p126
aVYou can do it with threats
p127
aVof coercion, "sticks,"
p128
aVyou can do it with payments,
p129
aV"carrots,"
p130
aVor you can do it by getting others
p131
aVto want what you want.
p132
aVAnd that ability to get others to want what you want,
p133
aVto get the outcomes you want
p134
aVwithout coercion or payment,
p135
aVis what I call soft power.
p136
aVAnd that soft power has been much neglected
p137
aVand much misunderstood,
p138
aVand yet it's tremendously important.
p139
aVIndeed, if you can learn
p140
aVto use more soft power,
p141
aVyou can save a lot
p142
aVon carrots and sticks.
p143
aVTraditionally, the way people thought about power
p144
aVwas primarily in terms of military power.
p145
aVFor example, the great Oxford historian
p146
aVwho taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor,
p147
aVdefined a great power
p148
aVas a country able to prevail in war.
p149
aVBut we need a new narrative
p150
aVif we're to understand power in the 21st century.
p151
aVIt's not just prevailing at war,
p152
aVthough war still persists.
p153
aVIt's not whose army wins;
p154
aVit's also whose story wins.
p155
aVAnd we have to think much more in terms of narratives
p156
aVand whose narrative is going to be effective.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow let me go back
p159
aVto the question
p160
aVof power transition
p161
aVbetween states
p162
aVand what's happening there.
p163
aVthe narratives that we use now
p164
aVtend to be the rise and fall
p165
aVof the great powers.
p166
aVAnd the current narrative is all about
p167
aVthe rise of China
p168
aVand the decline of the United States.
p169
aVIndeed, with the 2008 financial crisis,
p170
aVmany people said this was
p171
aVthe beginning of the end of American power.
p172
aVThe tectonic plates
p173
aVof world politics were shifting.
p174
aVAnd president Medvedev of Russia, for example,
p175
aVpronounced in 2008
p176
aVthis was the beginning of the end
p177
aVof United States power.
p178
aVBut in fact,
p179
aVthis metaphor of decline
p180
aVis often very misleading.
p181
aVIf you look at history, in recent history,
p182
aVyou'll see the cycles of belief
p183
aVin American decline
p184
aVcome and go every 10 or 15 years or so.
p185
aVIn 1958,
p186
aVafter the Soviets put up Sputnik,
p187
aVit was "That's the end of America."
p188
aVIn 1973, with the oil embargo
p189
aVand the closing of the gold window,
p190
aVthat was the end of America.
p191
aVIn the 1980s,
p192
aVas America went through a transition in the Reagan period,
p193
aVbetween the rust belt economy of the midwest
p194
aVto the Silicon Valley economy of California,
p195
aVthat was the end of America.
p196
aVBut in fact, what we've seen
p197
aVis none of those were true.
p198
aVIndeed, people were over-enthusiastic
p199
aVin the early 2000s,
p200
aVthinking America could do anything,
p201
aVwhich led us into some disastrous
p202
aVforeign policy adventures,
p203
aVand now we're back to decline again.
p204
aa(lp205
VThe moral of this story
p206
aVis all these narratives about rise and fall and decline
p207
aVtell us a lot more about psychology
p208
aVthan they do about reality.
p209
aVIf we try to focus on the reality,
p210
aVthen what we need to focus on
p211
aVis what's really happening
p212
aVin terms of China and the United States.
p213
aVGoldman Sachs has projected
p214
aVthat China, the Chinese economy,
p215
aVwill surpass that of the U.S.
p216
aVby 2027.
p217
aVSo we've got, what,
p218
aV17 more years to go or so
p219
aVbefore China's bigger.
p220
aVNow someday,
p221
aVwith a billion point three people getting richer,
p222
aVthey are going to be bigger than the United States.
p223
aVBut be very careful about these projections
p224
aVsuch as the Goldman Sachs projection
p225
aVas though that gives you an accurate picture
p226
aVof power transition in this century.
p227
aVLet me mention three reasons why it's too simple.
p228
aVFirst of all, it's a linear projection.
p229
aVYou know, everything says,
p230
aVhere's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S.,
p231
aVhere it goes \u2014 straight line.
p232
aVHistory is not linear.
p233
aVThere are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.
p234
aVThe second thing is
p235
aVthat the Chinese economy
p236
aVpasses the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030,
p237
aVwhich it may it,
p238
aVthat will be a measure of total economic size,
p239
aVbut not of per capita income \u2014
p240
aVwon't tell you about the composition of the economy.
p241
aVChina still has large areas
p242
aVof underdevelopment
p243
aVand per capita income is a better measure
p244
aVof the sophistication of the economy.
p245
aVAnd that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans
p246
aVuntil somewhere in the latter part,
p247
aVafter 2050, of this century.
p248
aa(lp249
VThe other point that's worth noticing
p250
aVis how one-dimensional
p251
aVthis projection is.
p252
aVYou know, it looks at economic power
p253
aVmeasured by GDP.
p254
aVDoesn't tell you much about military power,
p255
aVdoesn't tell you very much about soft power.
p256
aVIt's all very one-dimensional.
p257
aVAnd also, when we think about the rise of Asia,
p258
aVor return of Asia
p259
aVas I called it a little bit earlier,
p260
aVit's worth remembering Asia's not one thing.
p261
aVIf you're sitting in Japan,
p262
aVor in New Delhi,
p263
aVor in Hanoi,
p264
aVyour view of the rise of China
p265
aVis a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing.
p266
aVIndeed, one of the advantages
p267
aVthat the Americans will have
p268
aVin terms of power in Asia
p269
aVis all those countries
p270
aVwant an American insurance policy
p271
aVagainst the rise of China.
p272
aVIt's as though Mexico and Canada
p273
aVwere hostile neighbors to the United States,
p274
aVwhich they're not.
p275
aVSo these simple projections
p276
aVof the Goldman Sachs type
p277
aVare not telling us what we need to know
p278
aVabout power transition.
p279
aa(lp280
VBut you might ask, well so what in any case?
p281
aVWhy does it matter? Who cares?
p282
aVIs this just a game
p283
aVthat diplomats and academics play?
p284
aVThe answer is it matters quite a lot.
p285
aVBecause, if you believe in decline
p286
aVand you get the answers wrong on this,
p287
aVthe facts, not the myths,
p288
aVyou may have policies which are very dangerous.
p289
aVLet me give you an example from history.
p290
aVThe Peloponnesian War
p291
aVwas the great conflict
p292
aVin which the Greek city state system
p293
aVtore itself apart
p294
aVtwo and a half millennia ago.
p295
aVWhat caused it?
p296
aVThucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War,
p297
aVsaid it was the rise in the power of Athens
p298
aVand the fear it created in Sparta.
p299
aVNotice both halves of that explanation.
p300
aa(lp301
VMany people argue
p302
aVthat the 21st century
p303
aVis going to repeat the 20th century,
p304
aVin which World War One,
p305
aVthe great conflagration
p306
aVin which the European state system
p307
aVtore itself apart
p308
aVand destroyed its centrality in the world,
p309
aVthat that was caused by
p310
aVthe rise in the power of Germany
p311
aVand the fear it created in Britain.
p312
aVSo there are people who are telling us
p313
aVthis is going to be reproduced today,
p314
aVthat what we're going to see
p315
aVis the same thing now in this century.
p316
aVNo, I think that's wrong.
p317
aVIt's bad history.
p318
aVFor one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain
p319
aVin industrial strength by 1900.
p320
aVAnd as I said earlier,
p321
aVChina has not passed the United States.
p322
aVBut also, if you have this belief
p323
aVand it creates a sense of fear,
p324
aVit leads to overreaction.
p325
aVAnd the greatest danger we have
p326
aVof managing this power transition
p327
aVof the shift toward the East is fear.
p328
aVTo paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt
p329
aVfrom a different context,
p330
aVthe greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.
p331
aVWe don't have to fear the rise of China
p332
aVor the return of Asia.
p333
aVAnd if we have policies
p334
aVin which we take it
p335
aVin that larger historical perspective,
p336
aVwe're going to be able
p337
aVto manage this process.
p338
aa(lp339
VLet me say a word now
p340
aVabout the distribution of power
p341
aVand how it relates to power diffusion
p342
aVand then pull these two types together.
p343
aVIf you ask how is power distributed in the world today,
p344
aVit's distributed much like
p345
aVa three-dimensional chess game.
p346
aVTop board:
p347
aVmilitary power among states.
p348
aVThe United States is the only superpower,
p349
aVand it's likely to remain that way
p350
aVfor two or three decades.
p351
aVChina's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board.
p352
aVMiddle board of this three-dimensional chess game:
p353
aVeconomic power among states.
p354
aVPower is multi-polar.
p355
aVThere are balancers \u2014
p356
aVthe U.S., Europe,
p357
aVChina, Japan
p358
aVcan balance each other.
p359
aVThe bottom board of this three-dimensional,
p360
aVthe board of transnational relations,
p361
aVthings that cross borders outside the control of governments,
p362
aVthings like climate change, drug trade,
p363
aVfinancial flows,
p364
aVpandemics,
p365
aVall these things that cross borders
p366
aVoutside the control of governments,
p367
aVthere nobody's in charge.
p368
aVIt makes no sense to call this unipolar
p369
aVor multi-polar.
p370
aVPower is chaotically distributed.
p371
aVAnd the only way you can solve these problems \u2014
p372
aVand this is where many greatest challenges
p373
aVare coming in this century \u2014
p374
aVis through cooperation,
p375
aVthrough working together,
p376
aVwhich means that soft power becomes more important,
p377
aVthat ability to organize networks
p378
aVto deal with these kinds of problems
p379
aVand to be able to get cooperation.
p380
aa(lp381
VAnother way of putting it
p382
aVis that as we think of power in the 21st century,
p383
aVwe want to get away from the idea
p384
aVthat power's always zero sum \u2014
p385
aVmy gain is your loss and vice versa.
p386
aVPower can also be positive sum,
p387
aVwhere your gain can be my gain.
p388
aVIf China develops greater energy security
p389
aVand greater capacity
p390
aVto deal with its problems of carbon emissions,
p391
aVthat's good for us
p392
aVas well as good for China
p393
aVas well as good for everybody else.
p394
aVSo empowering China
p395
aVto deal with its own problems of carbon
p396
aVis good for everybody,
p397
aVand it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose.
p398
aVIt's one in which we can all gain.
p399
aVSo as we think about power
p400
aVin this century,
p401
aVwe want to get away from this view
p402
aVthat it's all I win, you lose.
p403
aVNow I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this.
p404
aVWars persist. Power persists.
p405
aVMilitary power is important.
p406
aVKeeping balances is important.
p407
aVAll this still persists.
p408
aVHard power is there,
p409
aVand it will remain.
p410
aVBut unless you learn how to mix
p411
aVhard power with soft power
p412
aVinto strategies that I call smart power,
p413
aVyou're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems
p414
aVthat we're facing.
p415
aa(lp416
VSo the key question that we need to think about as we look at this
p417
aVis how do we work together
p418
aVto produce global public goods,
p419
aVthings from which all of us can benefit?
p420
aVHow do we define our national interests
p421
aVso that it's not just zero sum,
p422
aVbut positive sum.
p423
aVIn that sense, if we define our interests,
p424
aVfor example, for the United States
p425
aVthe way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century,
p426
aVkeeping an open trading system,
p427
aVkeeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas \u2014
p428
aVthose were good for Britain,
p429
aVthey were good for others as well.
p430
aVAnd in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that.
p431
aVHow do we produce global public goods,
p432
aVwhich are good for us,
p433
aVbut good for everyone at the same time?
p434
aVAnd that's going to be the good news dimension
p435
aVof what we need to think about
p436
aVas we think of power in the 21st century.
p437
aa(lp438
VThere are ways to define our interests
p439
aVin which, while protecting ourselves with hard power,
p440
aVwe can organize with others in networks
p441
aVto produce, not only public goods,
p442
aVbut ways that will enhance our soft power.
p443
aVSo if one looks at the statements
p444
aVthat have been made about this,
p445
aVI am impressed that when Hillary Clinton
p446
aVdescribed the foreign policy
p447
aVof the Obama administration,
p448
aVshe said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration
p449
aVwas going to be smart power,
p450
aVas she put it, "using all the tools
p451
aVin our foreign policy tool box."
p452
aVAnd if we're going to deal
p453
aVwith these two great power shifts that I've described,
p454
aVthe power shift represented by transition among states,
p455
aVthe power shift represented
p456
aVby diffusion of power away from all states,
p457
aVwe're going to have to develop a new narrative of power
p458
aVin which we combine hard and soft power
p459
aVinto strategies of smart power.
p460
aVAnd that's the good news I have. We can do that.
p461
aa(lp462
VThank you very much.

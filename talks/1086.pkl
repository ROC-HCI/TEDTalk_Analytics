VThis is Revolution 2.0.
p5
aVNo one was a hero. No one was a hero.
p6
aVBecause everyone was a hero.
p7
aVEveryone has done something.
p8
aVWe all use Wikipedia.
p9
aVIf you think of the concept of Wikipedia
p10
aVwhere everyone is collaborating on content,
p11
aVand at the end of the day
p12
aVyou've built the largest encyclopedia in the world.
p13
aVFrom just an idea that sounded crazy,
p14
aVyou have the largest encyclopedia in the world.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd in the Egyptian revolution,
p17
aVthe Revolution 2.0,
p18
aVeveryone has contributed something,
p19
aVsmall or big. They contributed something \u2014
p20
aVto bring us
p21
aVone of the most inspiring stories
p22
aVin the history of mankind
p23
aVwhen it comes to revolutions.
p24
aVIt was actually really inspiring
p25
aVto see all these Egyptians completely changing.
p26
aVIf you look at the scene,
p27
aVEgypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill \u2014
p28
aVgoing into a downhill.
p29
aVEverything was going bad.
p30
aVEverything was going wrong.
p31
aVWe only ranked high when it comes to poverty,
p32
aVcorruption,
p33
aVlack of freedom of speech,
p34
aVlack of political activism.
p35
aVThose were the achievements
p36
aVof our great regime.
p37
aVYet, nothing was happening.
p38
aVAnd it's not because people were happy
p39
aVor people were not frustrated.
p40
aVIn fact, people were extremely frustrated.
p41
aVBut the reason why everyone was silent
p42
aVis what I call the psychological barrier of fear.
p43
aVEveryone was scared.
p44
aVNot everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians
p45
aVthat I have to thank for being so brave \u2014
p46
aVgoing into protests as a couple of hundred,
p47
aVgetting beaten up and arrested.
p48
aVBut in fact, the majority were scared.
p49
aVEveryone did not want really
p50
aVto get in trouble.
p51
aa(lp52
VA dictator cannot live without the force.
p53
aVThey want to make people live in fear.
p54
aVAnd that psychological barrier of fear
p55
aVhad worked for so many years,
p56
aVand here comes the Internet,
p57
aVtechnology, BlackBerry, SMS.
p58
aVIt's helping all of us to connect.
p59
aVPlatforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook
p60
aVwere helping us a lot
p61
aVbecause it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone.
p62
aVThere are a lot of people who are frustrated."
p63
aVThere are lots of people who are frustrated.
p64
aVThere are lots of people who actually share the same dream.
p65
aVThere are lots of people who care about their freedom.
p66
aVThey probably have the best life in the world.
p67
aVThey are living in happiness. They are living in their villas.
p68
aVThey are happy. They don't have problems.
p69
aVBut they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian.
p70
aa(lp71
VA lot of us, we're not really happy
p72
aVwhen we see a video of an Egyptian man
p73
aVwho's eating the trash
p74
aVwhile others are stealing
p75
aVbillions of Egyptian pounds
p76
aVfrom the wealth of the country.
p77
aVThe Internet has played a great role,
p78
aVhelping these people to speak up their minds,
p79
aVto collaborate together, to start thinking together.
p80
aVIt was an educational campaign.
p81
aa(lp82
VKhaled Saeed was killed
p83
aVin June 2010.
p84
aVI still remember the photo.
p85
aVI still remember every single detail of that photo.
p86
aVThe photo was horrible.
p87
aVHe was tortured,
p88
aVbrutally tortured to death.
p89
aVBut then what was the answer of the regime?
p90
aV"He choked on a pile of hash" \u2014
p91
aVthat was their answer:
p92
aV"He's a criminal.
p93
aVHe's someone who escaped from all these bad things."
p94
aVBut people did not relate to this.
p95
aVPeople did not believe this.
p96
aVBecause of the Internet, the truth prevailed
p97
aVand everyone knew the truth.
p98
aVAnd everyone started to think that "this guy could be my brother."
p99
aVHe was a middle-class guy.
p100
aVHis photo was remembered by all of us.
p101
aa(lp102
VA page was created.
p103
aVAn anonymous administrator
p104
aVwas basically inviting people to join the page,
p105
aVand there was no plan.
p106
aV"What are we going to do?" "I don't know."
p107
aVIn a few days, tens of thousands of people there \u2014
p108
aVangry Egyptians
p109
aVwho were asking the ministry of interior affairs,
p110
aV"Enough.
p111
aVGet those who killed this guy.
p112
aVTo just bring them to justice."
p113
aVBut of course, they don't listen.
p114
aVIt was an amazing story \u2014
p115
aVhow everyone started feeling the ownership.
p116
aVEveryone was an owner in this page.
p117
aVPeople started contributing ideas.
p118
aVIn fact, one of the most ridiculous ideas
p119
aVwas, "Hey, let's have a silent stand.
p120
aVLet's get people to go in the street,
p121
aVface the sea, their back to the street,
p122
aVdressed in black, standing up silently for one hour,
p123
aVdoing nothing and then just leaving,
p124
aVgoing back home."
p125
aVFor some people, that was like, "Wow, silent stand.
p126
aVAnd next time it's going to be vibration."
p127
aVPeople were making fun of the idea.
p128
aVBut actually when people went to the street \u2014
p129
aVthe first time it was thousands of people
p130
aVin Alexandria \u2014
p131
aVit felt like \u2014 it was amazing. It was great
p132
aVbecause it connected people from the virtual world,
p133
aVbringing them to the real world,
p134
aVsharing the same dream,
p135
aVthe same frustration, the same anger,
p136
aVthe same desire for freedom.
p137
aVAnd they were doing this thing.
p138
aVBut did the regime learn anything? Not really.
p139
aVThey were actually attacking them.
p140
aVThey were actually abusing them,
p141
aVdespite the fact of how peaceful these guys were \u2014
p142
aVthey were not even protesting.
p143
aVAnd things had developed
p144
aVuntil the Tunisian revolution.
p145
aa(lp146
VThis whole page was, again,
p147
aVmanaged by the people.
p148
aVIn fact, the anonymous admin job
p149
aVwas to collect ideas,
p150
aVhelp people to vote on them
p151
aVand actually tell them what they are doing.
p152
aVPeople were taking shots and photos;
p153
aVpeople were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt;
p154
aVpeople were suggesting ideas,
p155
aVthey were actually voting on ideas,
p156
aVand then they were executing the ideas; people were creating videos.
p157
aVEverything was done by the people to the people,
p158
aVand that's the power of the Internet.
p159
aVThere was no leader.
p160
aVThe leader was everyone on that page.
p161
aVThe Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying,
p162
aVinspired all of us, showed us that there is a way.
p163
aVYes we can. We can do it.
p164
aVWe have the same problems;
p165
aVwe can just go in the streets.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd when I saw the street on the 25th,
p168
aVI went back and said,
p169
aV"Egypt before the 25th
p170
aVis never going to be Egypt after the 25th.
p171
aVThe revolution is happening.
p172
aVThis is not the end,
p173
aVthis is the beginning of the end."
p174
aVI was detained on the 27th night.
p175
aVThank God I announced the locations and everything.
p176
aVBut they detained me.
p177
aVAnd I'm not going to talk about my experience, because this is not about me.
p178
aVI was detained for 12 days,
p179
aVblindfolded, handcuffed.
p180
aVAnd I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything.
p181
aVI was not allowed to speak with anyone.
p182
aVAnd I went out.
p183
aVThe next day I was in Tahrir.
p184
aVSeriously, with the amount of change I had noticed in this square,
p185
aVI thought it was 12 years.
p186
aVI never had in my mind
p187
aVto see this Egyptian,
p188
aVthe amazing Egyptian.
p189
aVThe fear is no longer fear.
p190
aVIt's actually strength \u2014 it's power.
p191
aVPeople were so empowered.
p192
aVIt was amazing how everyone was so empowered
p193
aVand now asking for their rights.
p194
aVCompletely opposite.
p195
aVExtremism became tolerance.
p196
aa(lp197
VWho would [have] imagined before the 25th,
p198
aVif I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray
p199
aVand tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them,
p200
aVand then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray
p201
aVand tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them \u2014
p202
aVthis is amazing.
p203
aVAll the stereotypes
p204
aVthat the regime was trying to put on us
p205
aVthrough their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media,
p206
aVare proven wrong.
p207
aVThis whole revolution showed us
p208
aVhow ugly such a regime was
p209
aVand how great and amazing
p210
aVthe Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman,
p211
aVhow simple and amazing these people are
p212
aVwhenever they have a dream.
p213
aa(lp214
VWhen I saw that,
p215
aVI went back and I wrote on Facebook.
p216
aVAnd that was a personal belief,
p217
aVregardless of what's going on,
p218
aVregardless of the details.
p219
aVI said that, "We are going to win.
p220
aVWe are going to win because we don't understand politics.
p221
aVWe're going to win because we don't play their dirty games.
p222
aVWe're going to win because we don't have an agenda.
p223
aVWe're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes
p224
aVactually come from our hearts.
p225
aVWe're going to win because we have dreams.
p226
aVWe're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams."
p227
aVAnd that's actually what happened. We won.
p228
aVAnd that's not because of anything,
p229
aVbut because we believed in our dream.
p230
aVThe winning here is not
p231
aVthe whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene.
p232
aVThe winning is the winning of the dignity
p233
aVof every single Egyptian.
p234
aa(lp235
VActually, I had this taxi driver telling me,
p236
aV"Listen, I am breathing freedom.
p237
aVI feel that I have dignity
p238
aVthat I have lost for so many years."
p239
aVFor me that's winning,
p240
aVregardless of all the details.
p241
aa(lp242
VMy last word to you is a statement I believe in,
p243
aVwhich Egyptians have proven to be true,
p244
aVthat the power of the people
p245
aVis much stronger than the people in power.
p246
aa(lp247
VThanks a lot.

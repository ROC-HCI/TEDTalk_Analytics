VJoe Kowan: I have stage fright.
p5
aVI've always had stage fright,
p6
aVand not just a little bit,
p7
aVit's a big bit.
p8
aVAnd it didn't even matter until I was 27.
p9
aVThat's when I started writing songs, and even then
p10
aVI only played them for myself.
p11
aVJust knowing my roommates were in the  same house made me uncomfortable.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut after a couple of years,  just writing songs wasn't enough.
p14
aVI had all these stories and ideas, and I wanted to share them with people,
p15
aVbut physiologically, I couldn't do it.
p16
aVI had this irrational fear.
p17
aVBut the more I wrote, and the more I practiced,
p18
aVthe more I wanted to perform.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo on the week of my 30th birthday,
p21
aVI decided I was going to go to this local open mic,
p22
aVand put this fear behind me.
p23
aVWell, when I got there, it was packed.
p24
aVThere were like 20 people there.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVAnd they all looked angry.
p27
aVBut I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play,
p28
aVand I felt pretty good.
p29
aa(lp30
VPretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn,
p31
aVwhen my whole body rebelled, and  this wave of anxiety just washed over me.
p32
aVNow, when you experience fear,  your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.
p33
aVSo you have a rush of adrenaline,  your heart rate increases,
p34
aVyour breathing gets faster.
p35
aVNext your non-essential systems start  to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter)
p36
aVSo your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed away from your extremities,
p37
aVso your fingers don't work anymore.
p38
aVYour pupils dilate, your muscles contract, your Spidey sense tingles,
p39
aVbasically your whole body is trigger-happy. (Laughter)
p40
aVThat condition is not conducive  to performing folk music.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVI mean, your nervous system is an idiot.
p43
aVReally? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference
p44
aVbetween a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers
p45
aVon a Tuesday night open mic?
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVI have never been more terrified \u2014 until now.
p48
aV(Laughter and cheers)
p49
aa(lp50
VSo then it was my turn,
p51
aVand somehow, I get myself onto  the stage, I start my song,
p52
aVI open my mouth to sing the first line,
p53
aVand this completely horrible vibrato \u2014
p54
aVyou know, when your voice wavers \u2014  comes streaming out.
p55
aVAnd this is not the good kind of vibrato,  like an opera singer has,
p56
aVthis is my whole body just convulsing with fear.
p57
aVI mean, it's a nightmare.
p58
aVI'm embarrassed, the audience  is clearly uncomfortable,
p59
aVthey're focused on my discomfort.
p60
aVIt was so bad.
p61
aVBut that was my first real experience  as a solo singer-songwriter.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd something good did happen \u2014 I had the tiniest little glimpse
p64
aVof that audience connection that I was hoping for.
p65
aVAnd I wanted more. But I knew  I had to get past this nervousness.
p66
aa(lp67
VThat night I promised myself:  I would go back every week
p68
aVuntil I wasn't nervous anymore.
p69
aVAnd I did. I went back every single week,
p70
aVand sure enough, week after week,
p71
aVit didn't get any better. The same  thing happened every week. (Laughter)
p72
aVI couldn't shake it.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd that's when I had an epiphany.
p75
aVAnd I remember it really well, because I  don't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter)
p76
aVAll I had to do was write a song  that exploits my nervousness.
p77
aVThat only seems authentic when I have stage fright,
p78
aVand the more nervous I was,
p79
aVthe better the song would be. Easy.
p80
aVSo I started writing a song about having stage fright.
p81
aVFirst, fessing up to the problem,
p82
aVthe physical manifestations, how I would feel,
p83
aVhow the listener might feel.
p84
aVAnd then accounting for things like my shaky voice,
p85
aVand I knew I would be singing about a  half-octave higher than normal,
p86
aVbecause I was nervous.
p87
aVBy having a song that explained  what was happening to me,
p88
aVwhile it was happening,
p89
aVthat gave the audience permission to think about it.
p90
aVThey didn't have to feel bad  for me because I was nervous,
p91
aVthey could experience that with me,
p92
aVand we were all one big happy, nervous,  uncomfortable family. (Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VBy thinking about my audience,  by embracing and exploiting my problem,
p95
aVI was able to take something  that was blocking my progress,
p96
aVand turn it into something that  was essential for my success.
p97
aVAnd having the stage fright song let  me get past that biggest issue
p98
aVright in the beginning of a performance.
p99
aVAnd then I could move on,  and play the rest of my songs
p100
aVwith just a little bit more ease.
p101
aVAnd eventually, over time, I didn't  have to play the stage fright song at all.
p102
aVExcept for when I was really  nervous, like now. (Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VWould it be okay if I played the  stage fright song for you?
p105
aV(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VCan I have a sip of water?
p108
aV(Music)
p109
aVThank you.
p110
aa(lp111
V\u266b I'm not joking, you know, \u266b
p112
aV\u266b this stage fright is real. \u266b
p113
aV\u266b And if I'm up here trembling and singing, \u266b
p114
aV\u266b well, you'll know how I feel. \u266b
p115
aV\u266b And the mistake I'd be making, \u266b
p116
aV\u266b the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. \u266b
p117
aV\u266b As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, \u266b
p118
aV\u266b well, you don't have to be. \u266b
p119
aV\u266b Well, maybe just a little bit. \u266b
p120
aV(Laughter)
p121
aV\u266b And maybe I'll try to imagine  you all without clothes. \u266b
p122
aV\u266b But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows. \u266b
p123
aV\u266b Not to discuss this at length, \u266b
p124
aV\u266b but my body image was never my strength. \u266b
p125
aV\u266b So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, \u266b
p126
aV\u266b I mean, you're not even really naked. \u266b
p127
aV\u266b And I'm the one with the problem. \u266b
p128
aV\u266b And you tell me, don't worry  so much, you'll be great. \u266b
p129
aV\u266b But I'm the one living with me \u266b
p130
aV\u266b and I know how I get. \u266b
p131
aV\u266b Your advice is gentle but late. \u266b
p132
aV\u266b If not just a bit patronizing. \u266b
p133
aV\u266b And that sarcastic tone doesn't  help me when I sing. \u266b
p134
aV\u266b But we shouldn't talk about  these things right now, \u266b
p135
aV\u266b really, I'm up on stage, and  you're in the crowd. Hi. \u266b
p136
aV\u266b And I'm not making fun of  unnurtured, irrational fear, \u266b
p137
aV\u266b and if I wasn't ready to face this, \u266b
p138
aV\u266b I sure as hell wouldn't be here. \u266b
p139
aV\u266b But if I belt one note out clearly, \u266b
p140
aV\u266b you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. \u266b
p141
aV\u266b And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' \u266b
p142
aV\u266b my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. \u266b
p143
aV\u266b But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', \u266b
p144
aV\u266b my vocal cords movin', \u266b
p145
aV\u266b at speeds slightly faster than sound. \u266b
p146
aV(Applause)

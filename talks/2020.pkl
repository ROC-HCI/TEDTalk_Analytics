VIn the middle of my Ph.D.,
p5
aVI was hopelessly stuck.
p6
aVEvery research direction that I tried
p7
aVled to a dead end.
p8
aVIt seemed like my basic assumptions
p9
aVjust stopped working.
p10
aVI felt like a pilot flying through the mist,
p11
aVand I lost all sense of direction.
p12
aVI stopped shaving.
p13
aVI couldn't get out of bed in the morning.
p14
aVI felt unworthy
p15
aVof stepping across the gates of the university,
p16
aVbecause I wasn't like Einstein or Newton
p17
aVor any other scientist whose results
p18
aVI had learned about, because in science,
p19
aVwe just learn about the results, not the process.
p20
aVAnd so obviously, I couldn't be a scientist.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut I had enough support
p23
aVand I made it through
p24
aVand discovered something new about nature.
p25
aVThis is an amazing feeling of calmness,
p26
aVbeing the only person in the world
p27
aVwho knows a new law of nature.
p28
aVAnd I started the second project in my Ph.D,
p29
aVand it happened again.
p30
aVI got stuck and I made it through.
p31
aVAnd I started thinking,
p32
aVmaybe there's a pattern here.
p33
aVI asked the other graduate students, and they said,
p34
aV"Yeah, that's exactly what happened to us,
p35
aVexcept nobody told us about it."
p36
aVWe'd all studied science as if it's a series
p37
aVof logical steps between question and answer,
p38
aVbut doing research is nothing like that.
p39
aa(lp40
VAt the same time, I was also studying
p41
aVto be an improvisation theater actor.
p42
aVSo physics by day,
p43
aVand by night, laughing, jumping, singing,
p44
aVplaying my guitar.
p45
aVImprovisation theater,
p46
aVjust like science, goes into the unknown,
p47
aVbecause you have to make a scene onstage
p48
aVwithout a director, without a script,
p49
aVwithout having any idea what you'll portray
p50
aVor what the other characters will do.
p51
aVBut unlike science,
p52
aVin improvisation theater, they tell you from day one
p53
aVwhat's going to happen to you when you get onstage.
p54
aVYou're going to fail miserably.
p55
aVYou're going to get stuck.
p56
aVAnd we would practice staying creative
p57
aVinside that stuck place.
p58
aVFor example, we had an exercise
p59
aVwhere we all stood in a circle,
p60
aVand each person had to do the world's worst tap dance,
p61
aVand everybody else applauded
p62
aVand cheered you on,
p63
aVsupporting you onstage.
p64
aa(lp65
VWhen I became a professor
p66
aVand had to guide my own students
p67
aVthrough their research projects,
p68
aVI realized again,
p69
aVI don't know what to do.
p70
aVI'd studied thousands of hours of physics,
p71
aVbiology, chemistry,
p72
aVbut not one hour, not one concept
p73
aVon how to mentor, how to guide someone
p74
aVto go together into the unknown,
p75
aVabout motivation.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo I turned to improvisation theater,
p78
aVand I told my students from day one
p79
aVwhat's going to happen when you start research,
p80
aVand this has to do with our mental schema
p81
aVof what research will be like.
p82
aVBecause you see, whenever people do anything,
p83
aVfor example if I want to touch this blackboard,
p84
aVmy brain first builds up a schema,
p85
aVa prediction of exactly what my muscles will do
p86
aVbefore I even start moving my hand,
p87
aVand if I get blocked,
p88
aVif my schema doesn't match reality,
p89
aVthat causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance.
p90
aVThat's why your schemas had better match reality.
p91
aVBut if you believe the way science is taught,
p92
aVand if you believe textbooks, you're liable
p93
aVto have the following schema of research.
p94
aVIf A is the question,
p95
aVand B is the answer,
p96
aVthen research is a direct path.
p97
aVThe problem is that if an experiment doesn't work,
p98
aVor a student gets depressed,
p99
aVit's perceived as something utterly wrong
p100
aVand causes tremendous stress.
p101
aVAnd that's why I teach my students
p102
aVa more realistic schema.
p103
aVHere's an example
p104
aVwhere things don't match your schema.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aV(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VSo I teach my students a different schema.
p109
aVIf A is the question,
p110
aVB is the answer,
p111
aVstay creative in the cloud,
p112
aVand you start going,
p113
aVand experiments don't work, experiments don't work,
p114
aVexperiments don't work, experiments don't work,
p115
aVuntil you reach a place linked with negative emotions
p116
aVwhere it seems like your basic assumptions
p117
aVhave stopped making sense,
p118
aVlike somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet.
p119
aVAnd I call this place the cloud.
p120
aVNow you can be lost in the cloud
p121
aVfor a day, a week, a month, a year,
p122
aVa whole career,
p123
aVbut sometimes, if you're lucky enough
p124
aVand you have enough support,
p125
aVyou can see in the materials at hand,
p126
aVor perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud,
p127
aVa new answer,
p128
aVC, and you decide to go for it.
p129
aVAnd experiments don't work, experiments don't work,
p130
aVbut you get there,
p131
aVand then you tell everyone about it
p132
aVby publishing a paper that reads A arrow C,
p133
aVwhich is a great way to communicate,
p134
aVbut as long as you don't forget the path
p135
aVthat brought you there.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow this cloud is an inherent part
p138
aVof research, an inherent part of our craft,
p139
aVbecause the cloud stands guard at the boundary.
p140
aVIt stands guard at the boundary
p141
aVbetween the known
p142
aVand the unknown,
p143
aVbecause in order to discover something truly new,
p144
aVat least one of your basic assumptions has to change,
p145
aVand that means that in science,
p146
aVwe do something quite heroic.
p147
aVEvery day, we try to bring ourselves
p148
aVto the boundary between the known and the unknown
p149
aVand face the cloud.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow notice that I put B
p152
aVin the land of the known,
p153
aVbecause we knew about it in the beginning,
p154
aVbut C is always more interesting
p155
aVand more important than B.
p156
aVSo B is essential in order to get going,
p157
aVbut C is much more profound,
p158
aVand that's the amazing thing about resesarch.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow just knowing that word, the cloud,
p161
aVhas been transformational in my research group,
p162
aVbecause students come to me and say,
p163
aV"Uri, I'm in the cloud,"
p164
aVand I say, "Great, you must be feeling miserable."
p165
aV(Laughter)
p166
aVBut I'm kind of happy,
p167
aVbecause we might be close to the boundary
p168
aVbetween the known and the unknown,
p169
aVand we stand a chance of discovering
p170
aVsomething truly new,
p171
aVsince the way our mind works,
p172
aVit's just knowing that the cloud
p173
aVis normal, it's essential,
p174
aVand in fact beautiful,
p175
aVwe can join the Cloud Appreciation Society,
p176
aVand it detoxifies the feeling that something
p177
aVis deeply wrong with me.
p178
aVAnd as a mentor, I know what to do,
p179
aVwhich is to step up my support for the student,
p180
aVbecause research in psychology shows
p181
aVthat if you're feeling fear and despair,
p182
aVyour mind narrows down
p183
aVto very safe and conservative ways of thinking.
p184
aVIf you'd like to explore the risky paths
p185
aVneeded to get out of the cloud,
p186
aVyou need other emotions \u2014
p187
aVsolidarity, support, hope \u2014
p188
aVthat come with your connection from somebody else,
p189
aVso like in improvisation theater,
p190
aVin science, it's best to walk into the unknown
p191
aVtogether.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo knowing about the cloud,
p194
aVyou also learn from improvisation theater
p195
aVa very effective way to have conversations
p196
aVinside the cloud.
p197
aVIt's based on the central principle
p198
aVof improvisation theater,
p199
aVso here improvisation theater
p200
aVcame to my help again.
p201
aVIt's called saying "Yes, and"
p202
aVto the offers made by other actors.
p203
aVThat means accepting the offers
p204
aVand building on them, saying, "Yes, and."
p205
aVFor example, if one actor says,
p206
aV"Here is a pool of water,"
p207
aVand the other actor says,
p208
aV"No, that's just a stage,"
p209
aVthe improvisation is over.
p210
aVIt's dead, and everybody feels frustrated.
p211
aVThat's called blocking.
p212
aVIf you're not mindful of communications,
p213
aVscientific conversations can have a lot of blocking.
p214
aa(lp215
VSaying "Yes, and" sounds like this.
p216
aa(lp217
V"Here is a pool of water." "Yeah, let's jump in."
p218
aa(lp219
V"Look, there's a whale! Let's grab it by its tail.
p220
aVIt's pulling us to the moon!"
p221
aa(lp222
VSo saying "Yes, and" bypasses our inner critic.
p223
aVWe all have an inner critic
p224
aVthat kind of guards what we say,
p225
aVso people don't think that we're obscene
p226
aVor crazy or unoriginal,
p227
aVand science is full of the fear
p228
aVof appearing unoriginal.
p229
aVSaying "Yes, and" bypasses the critic
p230
aVand unlocks hidden voices of creativity
p231
aVyou didn't even know that you had,
p232
aVand they often carry the answer
p233
aVabout the cloud.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo you see, knowing about the cloud
p236
aVand about saying "Yes, and"
p237
aVmade my lab very creative.
p238
aVStudents started playing off of each others' ideas,
p239
aVand we made surprising discoveries
p240
aVin the interface between physics and biology.
p241
aVFor example, we were stuck for a year
p242
aVtrying to understand the intricate
p243
aVbiochemical networks inside our cells,
p244
aVand we said, "We are deeply in the cloud,"
p245
aVand we had a playful conversation
p246
aVwhere my student Shai Shen Orr said,
p247
aV"Let's just draw this on a piece of paper, this network,"
p248
aVand instead of saying,
p249
aV"But we've done that so many times
p250
aVand it doesn't work,"
p251
aVI said, "Yes, and
p252
aVlet's use a very big piece of paper,"
p253
aVand then Ron Milo said,
p254
aV"Let's use a gigantic architect's
p255
aVblueprint kind of paper, and I know where to print it,"
p256
aVand we printed out the network and looked at it,
p257
aVand that's where we made our most important discovery,
p258
aVthat this complicated network is just made
p259
aVof a handful of simple, repeating interaction patterns
p260
aVlike motifs in a stained glass window.
p261
aVWe call them network motifs,
p262
aVand they're the elementary circuits
p263
aVthat help us understand
p264
aVthe logic of the way cells make decisions
p265
aVin all organisms, including our body.
p266
aa(lp267
VSoon enough, after this,
p268
aVI started being invited to give talks
p269
aVto thousands of scientists across the world,
p270
aVbut the knowledge about the cloud
p271
aVand saying "Yes, and"
p272
aVjust stayed within my own lab,
p273
aVbecause you see, in science, we don't talk about the process,
p274
aVanything subjective or emotional.
p275
aVWe talk about the results.
p276
aVSo there was no way to talk about it in conferences.
p277
aVThat was unthinkable.
p278
aVAnd I saw scientists in other groups get stuck
p279
aVwithout even having a word to describe
p280
aVwhat they're seeing,
p281
aVand their ways of thinking
p282
aVnarrowed down to very safe paths,
p283
aVtheir science didn't reach its full potential,
p284
aVand they were miserable.
p285
aVI thought, that's the way it is.
p286
aVI'll try to make my lab as creative as possible,
p287
aVand if everybody else does the same,
p288
aVscience will eventually become
p289
aVmore and more better and better.
p290
aa(lp291
VThat way of thinking got turned on its head
p292
aVwhen by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller
p293
aVgive a talk about her experiences
p294
aVas a woman in science.
p295
aVAnd she asked,
p296
aV"Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective
p297
aVand emotional aspects of doing science?
p298
aVIt's not by chance. It's a matter of values."
p299
aVYou see, science seeks knowledge
p300
aVthat's objective and rational.
p301
aVThat's the beautiful thing about science.
p302
aVBut we also have a cultural myth
p303
aVthat the doing of science,
p304
aVwhat we do every day to get that knowledge,
p305
aVis also only objective and rational,
p306
aVlike Mr. Spock.
p307
aVAnd when you label something
p308
aVas objective and rational,
p309
aVautomatically, the other side,
p310
aVthe subjective and emotional,
p311
aVbecome labeled as non-science
p312
aVor anti-science or threatening to science,
p313
aVand we just don't talk about it.
p314
aVAnd when I heard that,
p315
aVthat science has a culture,
p316
aVeverything clicked into place for me,
p317
aVbecause if science has a culture,
p318
aVculture can be changed,
p319
aVand I can be a change agent
p320
aVworking to change the culture of science wherever I could.
p321
aVAnd so the very next lecture I gave in a conference,
p322
aVI talked about my science,
p323
aVand then I talked about the importance
p324
aVof the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science
p325
aVand how we should talk about them,
p326
aVand I looked at the audience,
p327
aVand they were cold.
p328
aVThey couldn't hear what I was saying
p329
aVin the context of a 10 back-to-back
p330
aVPowerPoint presentation conference.
p331
aVAnd I tried again and again, conference after conference,
p332
aVbut I wasn't getting through.
p333
aVI was in the cloud.
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd eventually I managed to get out the cloud
p336
aVusing improvisation and music.
p337
aVSince then, every conference I go to,
p338
aVI give a science talk and a second, special talk
p339
aVcalled "Love and fear in the lab,"
p340
aVand I start it off by doing a song
p341
aVabout scientists' greatest fear,
p342
aVwhich is that we work hard,
p343
aVwe discover something new,
p344
aVand somebody else publishes it before we do.
p345
aVWe call it being scooped,
p346
aVand being scooped feels horrible.
p347
aVIt makes us afraid to talk to each other,
p348
aVwhich is no fun,
p349
aVbecause we came to science to share our ideas
p350
aVand to learn from each other,
p351
aVand so I do a blues song,
p352
aVwhich \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p353
aVcalled "Scooped Again,"
p354
aVand I ask the audience to be my backup singers,
p355
aVand I tell them, "Your text is 'Scoop, Scoop.'"
p356
aVIt sounds like this: "Scoop, scoop!"
p357
aVSounds like this.
p358
aa(lp359
V\u266a I've been scooped again \u266a
p360
aa(lp361
V\u266a Scoop! Scoop! \u266a
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd then we go for it.
p364
aa(lp365
V\u266a I've been scooped again \u266a
p366
aa(lp367
V\u266a Scoop! Scoop! \u266a
p368
aa(lp369
V\u266a I've been scooped again \u266a
p370
aa(lp371
V\u266a Scoop! Scoop! \u266a
p372
aa(lp373
V\u266a I've been scooped again \u266a
p374
aa(lp375
V\u266a Scoop! Scoop! \u266a
p376
aa(lp377
V\u266a I've been scooped again \u266a
p378
aa(lp379
V\u266a Scoop! Scoop! \u266a
p380
aa(lp381
V\u266a Oh mama, can't you feel my pain \u266a
p382
aa(lp383
V\u266a Heavens help me, I've been scooped again \u266a
p384
aV(Applause)
p385
aa(lp386
VThank you.
p387
aVThank you for your backup singing.
p388
aa(lp389
VSo everybody starts laughing, starts breathing,
p390
aVnotices that there's other scientists around them
p391
aVwith shared issues,
p392
aVand we start talking about the emotional
p393
aVand subjective things that go on in research.
p394
aVIt feels like a huge taboo has been lifted.
p395
aVFinally, we can talk about this in a scientific conference.
p396
aVAnd scientists have gone on to form peer groups
p397
aVwhere they meet regularly
p398
aVand create a space to talk about the emotional
p399
aVand subjective things that happen as they're mentoring,
p400
aVas they're going into the unknown,
p401
aVand even started courses
p402
aVabout the process of doing science,
p403
aVabout going into the unknown together,
p404
aVand many other things.
p405
aa(lp406
VSo my vision is that,
p407
aVjust like every scientist knows the word "atom,"
p408
aVthat matter is made out of atoms,
p409
aVevery scientist would know the words
p410
aVlike "the cloud," saying "Yes, and,"
p411
aVand science will become much more creative,
p412
aVmake many, many more unexpected discoveries
p413
aVfor the benefit of us all,
p414
aVand would also be much more playful.
p415
aVAnd what I might ask you to remember from this talk
p416
aVis that next time you face
p417
aVa problem you can't solve
p418
aVin work or in life,
p419
aVthere's a word for what you're going to see:
p420
aVthe cloud.
p421
aVAnd you can go through the cloud
p422
aVnot alone but together
p423
aVwith someone who is your source of support
p424
aVto say "Yes, and" to your ideas,
p425
aVto help you say "Yes, and" to your own ideas,
p426
aVto increase the chance that,
p427
aVthrough the wisps of the cloud,
p428
aVyou'll find that moment of calmness
p429
aVwhere you get your first glimpse
p430
aVof your unexpected discovery,
p431
aVyour C.
p432
aa(lp433
VThank you.

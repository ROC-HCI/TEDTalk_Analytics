VIt's a great pleasure to be here.
p5
aVIt's a great pleasure to speak after
p6
aVBrian Cox from CERN.
p7
aVI think CERN is the home
p8
aVof the Large Hadron Collider.
p9
aVWhat ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider?
p10
aVWhere is the Small Hadron Collider?
p11
aVBecause the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing.
p12
aVNow, the Small Hadron Collider
p13
aVis in a cupboard, overlooked and neglected.
p14
aVYou know when the Large Hadron Collider started,
p15
aVand it didn't work, and people tried to work out why,
p16
aVit was the Small Hadron Collider team
p17
aVwho sabotaged it
p18
aVbecause they were so jealous.
p19
aVThe whole Hadron Collider family
p20
aVneeds unlocking.
p21
aa(lp22
VThe lesson of Brian's presentation, in a way \u2014
p23
aVall those fantastic pictures \u2014
p24
aVis this really:
p25
aVthat vantage point determines everything that you see.
p26
aVWhat Brian was saying was
p27
aVscience has opened up successively different vantage points
p28
aVfrom which we can see ourselves,
p29
aVand that's why it's so valuable.
p30
aVSo the vantage point you take
p31
aVdetermines virtually everything that you will see.
p32
aVThe question that you will ask
p33
aVwill determine much of the answer that you get.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd so if you ask this question:
p36
aVWhere would you look to see the future of education?
p37
aVThe answer that we've traditionally given to that
p38
aVis very straightforward, at least in the last 20 years:
p39
aVYou go to Finland.
p40
aVFinland is the best place in the world to see school systems.
p41
aVThe Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate,
p42
aVbut by golly, they are qualified.
p43
aVAnd they have absolutely amazing education systems.
p44
aVSo we all troop off to Finland,
p45
aVand we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland
p46
aVand its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it,
p47
aVand then we struggle to imagine how we might
p48
aVbring lessons back.
p49
aa(lp50
VWell, so, for this last year,
p51
aVwith the help of Cisco who sponsored me,
p52
aVfor some balmy reason, to do this,
p53
aVI've been looking somewhere else.
p54
aVBecause actually radical innovation does sometimes
p55
aVcome from the very best,
p56
aVbut it often comes from places
p57
aVwhere you have huge need \u2014
p58
aVunmet, latent demand \u2014
p59
aVand not enough resources for traditional solutions to work \u2014
p60
aVtraditional, high-cost solutions,
p61
aVwhich depend on professionals,
p62
aVwhich is what schools and hospitals are.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo I ended up in places like this.
p65
aVThis is a place called Monkey Hill.
p66
aVIt's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio.
p67
aVMost of the population growth of the next 50 years
p68
aVwill be in cities.
p69
aVWe'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year
p70
aVfor the next 30 years.
p71
aVAlmost all of that growth will be in the developed world.
p72
aVAlmost all of that growth will be
p73
aVin places like Monkey Hill.
p74
aVThis is where you'll find the fastest growing
p75
aVyoung populations of the world.
p76
aVSo if you want recipes to work \u2014
p77
aVfor virtually anything \u2014 health, education,
p78
aVgovernment politics
p79
aVand education \u2014
p80
aVyou have to go to these places.
p81
aVAnd if you go to these places, you meet people like this.
p82
aa(lp83
VThis is a guy called Juanderson.
p84
aVAt the age of 14,
p85
aVin common with many 14-year-olds in the Brazilian education system,
p86
aVhe dropped out of school.
p87
aVIt was boring.
p88
aVAnd Juanderson, instead, went into
p89
aVwhat provided kind of opportunity and hope
p90
aVin the place that he lived, which was the drugs trade.
p91
aVAnd by the age of 16, with rapid promotion,
p92
aVhe was running the drugs trade in 10 favelas.
p93
aVHe was turning over 200,000 dollars a week.
p94
aVHe employed 200 people.
p95
aVHe was going to be dead by the age of 25.
p96
aVAnd luckily, he met this guy,
p97
aVwho is Rodrigo Baggio,
p98
aVthe owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.
p99
aV1994, Rodrigo started something
p100
aVcalled CDI,
p101
aVwhich took computers
p102
aVdonated by corporations,
p103
aVput them into community centers in favelas
p104
aVand created places like this.
p105
aVWhat turned Juanderson around
p106
aVwas technology for learning
p107
aVthat made learning fun and accessible.
p108
aa(lp109
VOr you can go to places like this.
p110
aVThis is Kibera, which is the largest slum in East Africa.
p111
aVMillions of people living here,
p112
aVstretched over many kilometers.
p113
aVAnd there I met these two,
p114
aVAzra on the left, Maureen on the right.
p115
aVThey just finished their Kenyan certificate
p116
aVof secondary education.
p117
aVThat name should tell you that the Kenyan education system
p118
aVborrows almost everything
p119
aVfrom Britain, circa 1950,
p120
aVbut has managed to make it even worse.
p121
aVSo there are schools in slums like this.
p122
aVThey're places like this.
p123
aVThat's where Maureen went to school.
p124
aVThey're private schools. There are no state schools in slums.
p125
aVAnd the education they got was pitiful.
p126
aVIt was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns
p127
aVin another slum called Nakuru.
p128
aVHalf the children in this classroom have no parents
p129
aVbecause they've died through AIDS.
p130
aVThe other half have one parent
p131
aVbecause the other parent has died through AIDS.
p132
aVSo the challenges of education
p133
aVin this kind of place
p134
aVare not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain.
p135
aVThey are to stay alive, to earn a living,
p136
aVto not become HIV positive.
p137
aVThe one technology that spans rich and poor
p138
aVin places like this
p139
aVis not anything to do with industrial technology.
p140
aVIt's not to do with electricity or water.
p141
aVIt's the mobile phone.
p142
aVIf you want to design from scratch
p143
aVvirtually any service in Africa,
p144
aVyou would start now with the mobile phone.
p145
aVOr you could go to places like this.
p146
aa(lp147
VThis is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony,
p148
aVwhich is a very developed slum
p149
aVabout 25 minutes outside New Delhi,
p150
aVwhere I met these characters
p151
aVwho showed me around for the day.
p152
aVThe remarkable thing about these girls,
p153
aVand the sign of the kind of social revolution
p154
aVsweeping through the developing world
p155
aVis that these girls are not married.
p156
aVTen years ago, they certainly would have been married.
p157
aVNow they're not married, and they want to go on
p158
aVto study further, to have a career.
p159
aVThey've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate,
p160
aVwho have never ever done homework.
p161
aVAll across the developing world there are millions of parents \u2014
p162
aVtens, hundreds of millions \u2014
p163
aVwho for the first time
p164
aVare with children doing homework and exams.
p165
aVAnd the reason they carry on studying
p166
aVis not because they went to a school like this.
p167
aVThis is a private school.
p168
aVThis is a fee-pay school. This is a good school.
p169
aVThis is the best you can get
p170
aVin Hyderabad in Indian education.
p171
aVThe reason they went on studying was this.
p172
aa(lp173
VThis is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum
p174
aVby a revolutionary social entrepreneur
p175
aVcalled Sugata Mitra
p176
aVwho has conducted the most radical experiments,
p177
aVshowing that children, in the right conditions,
p178
aVcan learn on their own with the help of computers.
p179
aVThose girls have never touched Google.
p180
aVThey know nothing about Wikipedia.
p181
aVImagine what their lives would be like
p182
aVif you could get that to them.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo if you look, as I did,
p185
aVthrough this tour,
p186
aVand by looking at about a hundred case studies
p187
aVof different social entrepreneurs
p188
aVworking in these very extreme conditions,
p189
aVlook at the recipes that they come up with for learning,
p190
aVthey look nothing like school.
p191
aVWhat do they look like?
p192
aVWell, education is a global religion.
p193
aVAnd education, plus technology,
p194
aVis a great source of hope.
p195
aVYou can go to places like this.
p196
aa(lp197
VThis is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo.
p198
aVMost of the children there have parents who are illiterate.
p199
aVMany of them don't have electricity at home.
p200
aVBut they find it completely obvious
p201
aVto use computers, websites,
p202
aVmake videos, so on and so forth.
p203
aVWhen you go to places like this
p204
aVwhat you see is that
p205
aVeducation in these settings
p206
aVworks by pull, not push.
p207
aVMost of our education system is push.
p208
aVI was literally pushed to school.
p209
aVWhen you get to school, things are pushed at you:
p210
aVknowledge, exams,
p211
aVsystems, timetables.
p212
aVIf you want to attract people like Juanderson
p213
aVwho could, for instance,
p214
aVbuy guns, wear jewelry,
p215
aVride motorbikes and get girls
p216
aVthrough the drugs trade,
p217
aVand you want to attract him into education,
p218
aVhaving a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense.
p219
aVThat isn't really going to attract him.
p220
aVYou need to pull him.
p221
aVAnd so education needs to work by pull, not push.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd so the idea of a curriculum
p224
aVis completely irrelevant in a setting like this.
p225
aVYou need to start education
p226
aVfrom things that make a difference
p227
aVto them in their settings.
p228
aVWhat does that?
p229
aVWell, the key is motivation, and there are two aspects to it.
p230
aVOne is to deliver extrinsic motivation,
p231
aVthat education has a payoff.
p232
aVOur education systems all work
p233
aVon the principle that there is a payoff,
p234
aVbut you have to wait quite a long time.
p235
aVThat's too long if you're poor.
p236
aVWaiting 10 years for the payoff from education
p237
aVis too long when you need to meet daily needs,
p238
aVwhen you've got siblings to look after
p239
aVor a business to help with.
p240
aVSo you need education to be relevant and help people
p241
aVto make a living there and then, often.
p242
aVAnd you also need to make it intrinsically interesting.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo time and again, I found people like this.
p245
aVThis is an amazing guy, Sebastiao Rocha,
p246
aVin Belo Horizonte,
p247
aVin the third largest city in Brazil.
p248
aVHe's invented more than 200 games
p249
aVto teach virtually any subject under the sun.
p250
aVIn the schools and communities
p251
aVthat Taio works in,
p252
aVthe day always starts in a circle
p253
aVand always starts from a question.
p254
aVImagine an education system that started from questions,
p255
aVnot from knowledge to be imparted,
p256
aVor started from a game, not from a lesson,
p257
aVor started from the premise
p258
aVthat you have to engage people first
p259
aVbefore you can possibly teach them.
p260
aVOur education systems,
p261
aVyou do all that stuff afterward, if you're lucky,
p262
aVsport, drama, music.
p263
aVThese things, they teach through.
p264
aVThey attract people to learning
p265
aVbecause it's really a dance project
p266
aVor a circus project
p267
aVor, the best example of all \u2014
p268
aVEl Sistema in Venezuela \u2014
p269
aVit's a music project.
p270
aVAnd so you attract people through that into learning,
p271
aVnot adding that on after
p272
aVall the learning has been done
p273
aVand you've eaten your cognitive greens.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo El Sistema in Venezuela
p276
aVuses a violin as a technology of learning.
p277
aVTaio Rocha uses making soap
p278
aVas a technology of learning.
p279
aVAnd what you find when you go to these schemes
p280
aVis that they use people and places
p281
aVin incredibly creative ways.
p282
aVMasses of peer learning.
p283
aVHow do you get learning to people
p284
aVwhen there are no teachers,
p285
aVwhen teachers won't come, when you can't afford them,
p286
aVand even if you do get teachers,
p287
aVwhat they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve?
p288
aVWell, you create your own teachers.
p289
aVYou create peer-to-peer learning,
p290
aVor you create para-teachers, or you bring in specialist skills.
p291
aVBut you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people
p292
aVthrough technology, people and places that are different.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo this is a school in a bus
p295
aVon a building site
p296
aVin Pune, the fastest growing city in Asia.
p297
aVPune has 5,000 building sites.
p298
aVIt has 30,000 children
p299
aVon those building sites.
p300
aVThat's one city.
p301
aVImagine that urban explosion
p302
aVthat's going to take place across the developing world
p303
aVand how many thousands of children
p304
aVwill spend their school years on building sites.
p305
aVWell, this is a very simple scheme
p306
aVto get the learning to them through a bus.
p307
aVAnd they all treat learning,
p308
aVnot as some sort of academic, analytical activity,
p309
aVbut as that's something that's productive,
p310
aVsomething you make,
p311
aVsomething that you can do, perhaps earn a living from.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo I met this character, Steven.
p314
aVHe'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets
p315
aVbecause his parents had died of AIDS.
p316
aVAnd he was finally brought back into school,
p317
aVnot by the offer of GCSEs,
p318
aVbut by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter,
p319
aVa practical making skill.
p320
aVSo the trendiest schools in the world,
p321
aVHigh Tech High and others,
p322
aVthey espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity.
p323
aVHere, there isn't really an option.
p324
aVLearning has to be productive
p325
aVin order for it to make sense.
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd finally, they have a different model of scale,
p328
aVand it's a Chinese restaurant model
p329
aVof how to scale.
p330
aVAnd I learned it from this guy,
p331
aVwho is an amazing character.
p332
aVHe's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur
p333
aVin education in the world.
p334
aVHis name is Madhav Chavan,
p335
aVand he created something called Pratham.
p336
aVAnd Pratham runs preschool play groups
p337
aVfor, now, 21 million children in India.
p338
aVIt's the largest NGO in education in the world.
p339
aVAnd it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools.
p340
aVHe's a complete revolutionary.
p341
aVHe's actually a trade union organizer by background,
p342
aVand that's how he learned the skills
p343
aVto build his organization.
p344
aa(lp345
VWhen they got to a certain stage,
p346
aVPratham got big enough to attract
p347
aVsome pro bono support from McKinsey.
p348
aVMcKinsey came along and looked at his model and said,
p349
aV"You know what you should do with this, Madhav?
p350
aVYou should turn it into McDonald's.
p351
aVAnd what you do when you go to any new site
p352
aVis you kind of roll out a franchise.
p353
aVAnd it's the same wherever you go.
p354
aVIt's reliable and people know exactly where they are.
p355
aVAnd there will be no mistakes."
p356
aVAnd Madhav said,
p357
aV"Why do we have to do it that way?
p358
aVWhy can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants?"
p359
aa(lp360
VThere are Chinese restaurants everywhere,
p361
aVbut there is no Chinese restaurant chain.
p362
aVYet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant.
p363
aVThey know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different
p364
aVand the colors will be different and the name will be different.
p365
aVYou know a Chinese restaurant when you see it.
p366
aVThese people work with the Chinese restaurant model \u2014
p367
aVsame principles, different applications and different settings \u2014
p368
aVnot the McDonald's model.
p369
aVThe McDonald's model scales.
p370
aVThe Chinese restaurant model spreads.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo mass education
p373
aVstarted with social entrepreneurship
p374
aVin the 19th century.
p375
aVAnd that's desperately what we need again
p376
aVon a global scale.
p377
aVAnd what can we learn from all of that?
p378
aVWell, we can learn a lot
p379
aVbecause our education systems
p380
aVare failing desperately in many ways.
p381
aVThey fail to reach the people
p382
aVthey most need to serve.
p383
aVThey often hit their target but miss the point.
p384
aVImprovement is increasingly
p385
aVdifficult to organize;
p386
aVour faith in these systems, incredibly fraught.
p387
aVAnd this is just a very simple way of
p388
aVunderstanding what kind of innovation,
p389
aVwhat kind of different design we need.
p390
aa(lp391
VThere are two basic types of innovation.
p392
aVThere's sustaining innovation,
p393
aVwhich will sustain an existing institution or an organization,
p394
aVand disruptive innovation
p395
aVthat will break it apart, create some different way of doing it.
p396
aVThere are formal settings \u2014
p397
aVschools, colleges, hospitals \u2014
p398
aVin which innovation can take place,
p399
aVand informal settings \u2014 communities,
p400
aVfamilies, social networks.
p401
aVAlmost all our effort goes in this box,
p402
aVsustaining innovation in formal settings,
p403
aVgetting a better version
p404
aVof the essentially Bismarckian school system
p405
aVthat developed in the 19th century.
p406
aVAnd as I said, the trouble with this is that,
p407
aVin the developing world
p408
aVthere just aren't teachers to make this model work.
p409
aVYou'd need millions and millions of teachers
p410
aVin China, India, Nigeria
p411
aVand the rest of developing world to meet need.
p412
aVAnd in our system, we know
p413
aVthat simply doing more of this won't eat into
p414
aVdeep educational inequalities,
p415
aVespecially in inner cities
p416
aVand former industrial areas.
p417
aa(lp418
VSo that's why we need three more kinds of innovation.
p419
aVWe need more reinvention.
p420
aVAnd all around the world now you see
p421
aVmore and more schools reinventing themselves.
p422
aVThey're recognizably schools, but they look different.
p423
aVThere are Big Picture schools
p424
aVin the U.S. and Australia.
p425
aVThere are Kunskapsskolan schools
p426
aVin Sweden.
p427
aVOf 14 of them,
p428
aVonly two of them are in schools.
p429
aVMost of them are in other buildings not designed as schools.
p430
aVThere is an amazing school in Northen Queensland
p431
aVcalled Jaringan.
p432
aVAnd they all have the same kind of features:
p433
aVhighly collaborative, very personalized,
p434
aVoften pervasive technology,
p435
aVlearning that starts from questions
p436
aVand problems and projects,
p437
aVnot from knowledge and curriculum.
p438
aVSo we certainly need more of that.
p439
aa(lp440
VBut because so many of the issues in education
p441
aVaren't just in school,
p442
aVthey're in family and community,
p443
aVwhat you also need, definitely,
p444
aVis more on the right hand side.
p445
aVYou need efforts to supplement schools.
p446
aVThe most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy,
p447
aVthe family-based learning system
p448
aVto support and encourage people in schools.
p449
aVThe most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone,
p450
aVwhich over 10 years, led by Geoffrey Canada,
p451
aVhas, through a mixture of schooling
p452
aVand family and community projects,
p453
aVattempted to transform not just education in schools,
p454
aVbut the entire culture and aspiration
p455
aVof about 10,000 families in Harlem.
p456
aVWe need more of that
p457
aVcompletely new and radical thinking.
p458
aVYou can go to places an hour away, less,
p459
aVfrom this room,
p460
aVjust down the road, which need that,
p461
aVwhich need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined.
p462
aa(lp463
VAnd finally, you need transformational innovation
p464
aVthat could imagine getting learning to people
p465
aVin completely new and different ways.
p466
aVSo we are on the verge, 2015,
p467
aVof an amazing achievement,
p468
aVthe schoolification of the world.
p469
aVEvery child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school
p470
aVwill be able to have one in 2015.
p471
aVIt's an amazing thing.
p472
aVBut it is,

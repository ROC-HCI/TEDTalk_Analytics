VTwo years ago, after having served four years
p5
aVin the United States Marine Corps
p6
aVand deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan,
p7
aVI found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team
p8
aVof veterans and medical professionals
p9
aVin some of the hardest-hit areas of that city,
p10
aVthree days after the earthquake.
p11
aVWe were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go,
p12
aVthe places nobody else could go, and after three weeks,
p13
aVwe realized something. Military veterans
p14
aVare very, very good at disaster response.
p15
aVAnd coming home, my cofounder and I,
p16
aVwe looked at it, and we said, there are two problems.
p17
aVThe first problem is there's inadequate disaster response.
p18
aVIt's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology,
p19
aVand it's not using the best people.
p20
aVThe second problem that we became aware of
p21
aVwas a very inadequate veteran reintegration,
p22
aVand this is a topic that is front page news right now
p23
aVas veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan,
p24
aVand they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.
p25
aVAnd we sat here and we looked at these two problems,
p26
aVand finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems.
p27
aVThese are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that?
p28
aa(lp29
VWell, we can use disaster response as an opportunity
p30
aVfor service for the veterans coming home.
p31
aVRecent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want
p32
aVto continue their service when they take off their uniform.
p33
aVAnd we can use veterans to improve disaster response.
p34
aVNow on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010,
p35
aVwe responded to the tsunami in Chile,
p36
aVthe floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border.
p37
aVBut it was earlier this year, when one of our
p38
aVoriginal members caused us to shift focus in the organization.
p39
aa(lp40
VThis is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me.
p41
aVWe served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.
p42
aVClay was with us in Port-au-Prince. He was also with us in Chile.
p43
aVEarlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.
p44
aVThis was a tragedy, but it really forced us
p45
aVto refocus what it is that we were doing.
p46
aVYou know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened
p47
aVin Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself
p48
aVbecause of what he lost when he came home.
p49
aVHe lost purpose. He lost his community.
p50
aVAnd perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled
p53
aVfrom this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems \u2014
p54
aVin the initial iteration of our organization,
p55
aVwe were a disaster response organization that was using
p56
aVveteran service. We had a lot of success,
p57
aVand we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm.
p58
aVBut after Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly,
p59
aVnow moving forward, we see ourselves
p60
aVas a veteran service organization that's using disaster response.
p61
aVBecause we think that we can give that purpose
p62
aVand that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.
p63
aVAnd tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later
p64
aVHurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy
p67
aVwho graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.
p68
aVHe joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.
p69
aVThey send him to Iraq.
p70
aVEvery day he leaves the wire with a mission.
p71
aVThat mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.
p72
aVIt's to keep the men around him alive.
p73
aVIt's to pacify the village that he works in.
p74
aVHe's got a purpose. But he comes home [to] Kansas City, Missouri,
p75
aVmaybe he goes to college, maybe he's got a job,
p76
aVbut he doesn't have that same sense of purpose.
p77
aVYou give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin, Missouri
p78
aVafter a tornado, he regains that.
p79
aa(lp80
VGoing back, that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school
p81
aVin Kansas City, Missouri, joins the Army,
p82
aVthe Army gives him a rifle, they send him to Iraq.
p83
aVEvery day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him.
p84
aVHe leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back.
p85
aVHe's slept in the same sand. They've lived together.
p86
aVThey've eaten together. They've bled together.
p87
aVHe goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.
p88
aVHe gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off.
p89
aVHe doesn't have that community anymore.
p90
aVBut you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri,
p91
aVthey get that sense of community back.
p92
aa(lp93
VAgain, you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates
p94
aVhigh school in Kansas City.
p95
aVHe joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.
p96
aVThey send him to Iraq.
p97
aVThey pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade.
p98
aVHe takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones
p99
aVin his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City.
p100
aVHe doesn't have that same self-worth.
p101
aVBut you send him to Joplin after a tornado,
p102
aVand somebody once again is walking up to him
p103
aVand shaking their hand and thanking them for their service,
p104
aVnow they have self-worth again.
p105
aa(lp106
VI think it's very important, because right now
p107
aVsomebody needs to step up,
p108
aVand this generation of veterans has the opportunity
p109
aVto do that if they are given the chance.
p110
aVThank you very much. (Applause)

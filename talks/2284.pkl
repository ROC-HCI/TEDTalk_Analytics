VI am failing as a woman,
p5
aVI am failing as a feminist.
p6
aa(lp7
VI have passionate opinions about gender equality,
p8
aVbut I worry that to freely accept the label of "feminist,"
p9
aVwould not be fair to good feminists.
p10
aa(lp11
VI'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.
p12
aVOh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.
p13
aVOr at least, I wrote an essay,
p14
aVand then I wrote a book called "Bad Feminist,"
p15
aVand then in interviews, people started calling me The Bad Feminist.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VSo, what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself
p19
aVand a willful provocation,
p20
aVhas become a thing.
p21
aa(lp22
VLet me take a step back.
p23
aVWhen I was younger,
p24
aVmostly in my teens and 20s,
p25
aVI had strange ideas about feminists
p26
aVas hairy, angry, man-hating, sex-hating women \u2014
p27
aVas if those are bad things.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVThese days, I look at how women are treated the world over,
p30
aVand anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut back then,
p33
aVI worried about the tone people used
p34
aVwhen suggesting I might be a feminist.
p35
aVThe feminist label was an accusation,
p36
aVit was an "F" word, and not a nice one.
p37
aVI was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules,
p38
aVwho expects too much,
p39
aVwho thinks far too highly of myself,
p40
aVby daring to believe I'm equal \u2014 (Coughs) \u2014 superior to a man.
p41
aVYou don't want to be that rebel woman,
p42
aVuntil you realize that you very much are that woman,
p43
aVand cannot imagine being anyone else.
p44
aa(lp45
VAs I got older, I began to accept
p46
aVthat I am, indeed, a feminist, and a proud one.
p47
aVI hold certain truths to be self-evident:
p48
aVWomen are equal to men.
p49
aVWe deserve equal pay for equal work.
p50
aVWe have the right to move through the world as we choose,
p51
aVfree from harassment or violence.
p52
aVWe have the right to easy, affordable access to birth control,
p53
aVand reproductive services.
p54
aVWe have the right to make choices about our bodies,
p55
aVfree from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine.
p56
aVWe have the right to respect.
p57
aa(lp58
VThere's more.
p59
aVWhen we talk about the needs of women,
p60
aVwe have to consider the other identities we inhabit.
p61
aVWe are not just women.
p62
aVWe are people with different bodies,
p63
aVgender expressions, faiths, sexualities,
p64
aVclass backgrounds, abilities, and so much more.
p65
aVWe need to take into account
p66
aVthese differences and how they affect us,
p67
aVas much as we account for what we have in common.
p68
aVWithout this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.
p69
aa(lp70
VI hold these truths to be self-evident, but let me be clear:
p71
aVI'm a mess.
p72
aVI am full of contradictions.
p73
aVThere are many ways in which I'm doing feminism wrong.
p74
aa(lp75
VI have another confession.
p76
aVWhen I drive to work, I listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVEven though the lyrics are degrading to women \u2014
p79
aVthese lyrics offend me to my core \u2014
p80
aVthe classic Yin Yang Twins song "Salt Shaker" \u2014
p81
aVit is amazing.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aV"Make it work with your wet t-shirt.
p84
aVBitch, you gotta shake it 'til your camel starts to hurt!"
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVThink about it.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVPoetry, right?
p89
aVI am utterly mortified by my music choices.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VI firmly believe in man work,
p93
aVwhich is anything I don't want to do, including \u2014
p94
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p95
aVall domestic tasks,
p96
aVbut also: bug killing, trash removal, lawn care and vehicle maintenance.
p97
aVI want no part of any of that.
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVPink is my favorite color.
p100
aVI enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things.
p101
aVI watch "The Bachelor" and romantic comedies,
p102
aVand I have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true.
p103
aa(lp104
VSome of my transgressions are more flagrant.
p105
aVIf a woman wants to take her husband's name,
p106
aVthat is her choice, and it is not my place to judge.
p107
aVIf a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children,
p108
aVI embrace that choice, too.
p109
aVThe problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice;
p110
aVthe problem is that our society is set up
p111
aVto make women economically vulnerable when they choose.
p112
aVLet's deal with that.
p113
aV(Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VI reject the mainstream feminism
p116
aVthat has historically ignored or deflected the needs
p117
aVof women of color, working-class women, queer women and transgender women,
p118
aVin favor of supporting white, middle- and upper-class straight women.
p119
aVListen, if that's good feminism \u2014 I am a very bad feminist.
p120
aV(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VThere is also this:
p123
aVAs a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
p124
aVWe have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal.
p125
aVWe expect them to pose perfectly.
p126
aVWhen they disappoint us,
p127
aVwe gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on.
p128
aVLike I said, I am a mess \u2014
p129
aVconsider me knocked off that pedestal
p130
aVbefore you ever try to put me up there.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VToo many women,
p134
aVparticularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders,
p135
aVare afraid to be labeled as feminists.
p136
aVThey're afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a feminist,"
p137
aVfor fear of what that label means,
p138
aVfor fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations.
p139
aa(lp140
VTake, for example, Beyoncé, or as I call her, The Goddess.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aVShe has emerged, in recent years, as a visible feminist.
p143
aVAt the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards,
p144
aVshe performed in front of the word "feminist" 10 feet high.
p145
aVIt was a glorious spectacle to see
p146
aVthis pop star openly embracing feminism
p147
aVand letting young women and men know
p148
aVthat being a feminist is something to celebrate.
p149
aVAs the moment faded, cultural critics began endlessly debating
p150
aVwhether or not Beyoncé was, indeed, a feminist.
p151
aVThey graded her feminism,
p152
aVinstead of simply taking a grown, accomplished woman at her word.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aV(Applause)
p155
aa(lp156
VWe demand perfection from feminists,
p157
aVbecause we are still fighting for so much,
p158
aVwe want so much,
p159
aVwe need so damn much.
p160
aa(lp161
VWe go far beyond reasonable, constructive criticism,
p162
aVto dissecting any given woman's feminism,
p163
aVtearing it apart until there's nothing left.
p164
aVWe do not need to do that.
p165
aVBad feminism \u2014 or really, more inclusive feminism \u2014 is a starting point.
p166
aa(lp167
VBut what happens next?
p168
aVWe go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability,
p169
aVor walking the walk, and being a little bit brave.
p170
aVIf I listen to degrading music,
p171
aVI am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy
p172
aVto contribute a limitless supply.
p173
aVThese artists are not going to change
p174
aVhow they talk about women in their songs
p175
aVuntil we demand that change by affecting their bottom line.
p176
aVCertainly, it is difficult.
p177
aVWhy must it be so catchy?
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aVIt's hard to make the better choice,
p180
aVand it is so easy to justify a lesser one.
p181
aVBut \u2014
p182
aVwhen I justify bad choices,
p183
aVI make it harder for women to achieve equality,
p184
aVthe equality that we all deserve,
p185
aVand I need to own that.
p186
aa(lp187
VI think of my nieces, ages three and four.
p188
aVThey are gorgeous and headstrong, brilliant girls,
p189
aVwho are a whole lot of brave.
p190
aVI want them to thrive in a world where they are valued
p191
aVfor the powerful creatures they are.
p192
aVI think of them,
p193
aVand suddenly, the better choice becomes far easier to make.
p194
aa(lp195
VWe can all make better choices.
p196
aVWe can change the channel when a television show
p197
aVtreats sexual violence against women like sport,
p198
aVGame of Thrones.
p199
aVWe can change the radio station
p200
aVwhen we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
p201
aVWe can spend our box office dollars elsewhere
p202
aVwhen movies don't treat women
p203
aVas anything more than decorative objects.
p204
aVWe can stop supporting professional sports
p205
aVwhere the athletes treat  their partners like punching bags.
p206
aV(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
VIn other ways, men \u2014 and especially straight white men \u2014
p209
aVcan say, "No, I will not publish with your magazine,
p210
aVor participate in your project, or otherwise work with you,
p211
aVuntil you include a fair number of women,
p212
aVboth as participants and decision makers.
p213
aVI won't work with you until your publication,
p214
aVor your organization, is more inclusive of all kinds of difference."
p215
aa(lp216
VThose of us who are underrepresented
p217
aVand invited to participate in such projects,
p218
aVcan also decline to be included
p219
aVuntil more of us are invited through the glass ceiling,
p220
aVand we are tokens no more.
p221
aa(lp222
VWithout these efforts,
p223
aVwithout taking these stands,
p224
aVour accomplishments are going to mean very little.
p225
aVWe can commit these small acts of bravery
p226
aVand hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power \u2014
p227
aVeditors, movie and music producers,
p228
aVCEOs, lawmakers \u2014
p229
aVthe people who can make bigger, braver choices
p230
aVto create lasting, meaningful change.
p231
aa(lp232
VWe can also boldly claim our feminism \u2014
p233
aVgood, bad, or anywhere in between.
p234
aVThe last line of my book "Bad Feminist" says,
p235
aV"I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all."
p236
aVThis is true for so many reasons,
p237
aVbut first and foremost, I say this because once upon a time,
p238
aVmy voice was stolen from me,
p239
aVand feminism helped me to get my voice back.
p240
aa(lp241
VThere was an incident.
p242
aVI call it an incident so I can carry the burden of what happened.
p243
aVSome boys broke me,
p244
aVwhen I was so young, I did not know
p245
aVwhat boys can do to break a girl.
p246
aVThey treated me like I was nothing.
p247
aVI began to believe I was nothing.
p248
aVThey stole my voice, and in the after,
p249
aVI did not dare to believe
p250
aVthat anything I might say could matter.
p251
aa(lp252
VBut \u2014
p253
aVI had writing.
p254
aVAnd there, I wrote myself back together.
p255
aVI wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself.
p256
aVI read the words of women
p257
aVwho might understand a story like mine,
p258
aVand women who looked like me,
p259
aVand understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin.
p260
aVI read the words of women who showed me I was not nothing.
p261
aVI learned to write like them,
p262
aVand then I learned to write as myself.
p263
aVI found my voice again,
p264
aVand I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure.
p265
aa(lp266
VThrough writing and feminism,
p267
aVI also found that if I was a little bit brave,
p268
aVanother woman might hear me and see me and recognize
p269
aVthat none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are.
p270
aa(lp271
VIn one hand,
p272
aVI hold the power to accomplish anything.
p273
aVAnd in my other,
p274
aVI hold the humbling reality that I am just one woman.
p275
aa(lp276
VI am a bad feminist,
p277
aVI am a good woman,
p278
aVI am trying to become better in how I think,
p279
aVand what I say, and what I do,
p280
aVwithout abandoning everything that makes me human.
p281
aVI hope that we can all do the same.
p282
aVI hope that we can all be a little bit brave,
p283
aVwhen we most need such bravery.
p284
aV(Applause)

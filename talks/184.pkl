VWell, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain,
p5
aVthe functions and structure of the human brain.
p6
aVAnd I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails.
p7
aVHere is this mass of jelly, three-pound mass of jelly
p8
aVyou can hold in the palm of your hand,
p9
aVand it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
p10
aVIt can contemplate the meaning of infinity
p11
aVand it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity.
p12
aVAnd this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness,
p13
aVwhich I think is the holy grail of neuroscience, of neurology,
p14
aVand hopefully, someday, we'll understand how that happens.
p15
aa(lp16
VOK, so how do you study this mysterious organ?
p17
aVI mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells,
p18
aVlittle wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other,
p19
aVand from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities
p20
aVthat we call human nature and human consciousness.
p21
aVHow does this happen?
p22
aVWell, there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain.
p23
aVOne approach, the one we use mainly,
p24
aVis to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain,
p25
aVwhere there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain.
p26
aVWhat then happens is not an across-the-board reduction
p27
aVin all your mental capacities,
p28
aVa sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.
p29
aVWhat you get is a highly selective loss of one function,
p30
aVwith other functions being preserved intact,
p31
aVand this gives you some confidence in asserting
p32
aVthat that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function.
p33
aVSo you can then map function onto structure,
p34
aVand then find out what the circuitry's doing
p35
aVto generate that particular function.
p36
aVSo that's what we're trying to do.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo let me give you a few striking examples of this.
p39
aVIn fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.
p40
aVThe first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.
p41
aVIf you look at the first slide there,
p42
aVthat's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK \u2014
p43
aVthe lobes that constitute the brain.
p44
aVAnd if you look, tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes \u2014
p45
aVyou can't see it there \u2014
p46
aVis a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.
p47
aVAnd that's been called the face area in the brain,
p48
aVbecause when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.
p49
aVYou can still recognize them from their voice
p50
aVand say, "Oh yeah, that's Joe,"
p51
aVbut you can't look at their face and know who it is, right?
p52
aVYou can't even recognize yourself in the mirror.
p53
aVI mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks,
p54
aVand you know it's a mirror,
p55
aVbut you don't really recognize yourself as yourself.
p56
aa(lp57
VOK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus.
p58
aVBut there's another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact,
p59
aVthat very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists.
p60
aVThis is called the Capgras delusion,
p61
aVand that is a patient, who's otherwise completely normal,
p62
aVhas had a head injury, comes out of coma,
p63
aVotherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother
p64
aVand says, "This looks exactly like my mother, this woman,
p65
aVbut she's an impostor.
p66
aVShe's some other woman pretending to be my mother."
p67
aVNow, why does this happen?
p68
aVWhy would somebody \u2014 and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent
p69
aVin all other respects, but when he sees his mother,
p70
aVhis delusion kicks in and says, it's not mother.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, the most common interpretation of this,
p73
aVwhich you find in all the psychiatry textbooks,
p74
aVis a Freudian view, and that is that this chap \u2014
p75
aVand the same argument applies to women, by the way,
p76
aVbut I'll just talk about guys.
p77
aVWhen you're a little baby, a young baby,
p78
aVyou had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.
p79
aVThis is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud.
p80
aVI'm not saying I believe this,
p81
aVbut this is the standard Freudian view.
p82
aVAnd then, as you grow up, the cortex develops,
p83
aVand inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother.
p84
aVThank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.
p85
aVAnd then what happens is,
p86
aVthere's a blow to your head, damaging the cortex,
p87
aVallowing these latent sexual urges to emerge,
p88
aVflaming to the surface, and suddenly and inexplicably
p89
aVyou find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother.
p90
aVAnd you say, "My God, if this is my mom,
p91
aVhow come I'm being sexually turned on?
p92
aVShe's some other woman. She's an impostor."
p93
aVIt's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.
p94
aa(lp95
VThis has never made much sense to me, this argument.
p96
aVIt's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are \u2014
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aV\u2014 but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion,
p99
aVa patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVHe'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi,
p102
aVbut it's some other dog." Right?
p103
aVNow, you try using the Freudian explanation there.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVYou'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans,
p106
aVor some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow, what's really going on?
p109
aVSo, to explain this curious disorder,
p110
aVwe look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.
p111
aVNormally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs,
p112
aVgo to the visual areas in the brain.
p113
aVThere are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision,
p114
aVand after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure
p115
aVcalled the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces.
p116
aVThere are neurons there that are sensitive to faces.
p117
aVYou can call it the face area of the brain, right?
p118
aVI talked about that earlier.
p119
aVNow, when that area's damaged, you lose the ability to see faces, right?
p120
aa(lp121
VBut from that area, the message cascades
p122
aVinto a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system,
p123
aVthe emotional core of the brain,
p124
aVand that structure, called the amygdala,
p125
aVgauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at.
p126
aVIs it prey? Is it predator? Is it mate?
p127
aVOr is it something absolutely trivial, like a piece of lint,
p128
aVor a piece of chalk, or a \u2014 I don't want to point to that, but \u2014
p129
aVor a shoe, or something like that? OK?
p130
aVWhich you can completely ignore.
p131
aVSo if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important,
p132
aVthe messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system.
p133
aVYour heart starts beating faster.
p134
aVYou start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to
p135
aVcreate from muscular exertion.
p136
aVAnd that's fortunate, because we can put two electrodes on your palm
p137
aVand measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating.
p138
aVSo I can determine, when you're looking at something,
p139
aVwhether you're excited or whether you're aroused, or not, OK?
p140
aVAnd I'll get to that in a minute.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo my idea was, when this chap looks at an object, when he looks at his \u2014
p143
aVany object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and,
p144
aVhowever, and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus,
p145
aVand you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table,
p146
aVor your mother, for that matter, OK?
p147
aVAnd then the message cascades into the amygdala,
p148
aVand then goes down the autonomic nervous system.
p149
aVBut maybe, in this chap, that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system,
p150
aVthe emotional core of the brain, is cut by the accident.
p151
aVSo because the fusiform is intact,
p152
aVthe chap can still recognize his mother,
p153
aVand says, "Oh yeah, this looks like my mother."
p154
aVBut because the wire is cut to the emotional centers,
p155
aVhe says, "But how come, if it's my mother, I don't experience a warmth?"
p156
aVOr terror, as the case may be? Right?
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aVAnd therefore, he says, "How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions?
p159
aVThis can't be my mother.
p160
aVIt's some strange woman pretending to be my mother."
p161
aa(lp162
VHow do you test this?
p163
aVWell, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen,
p164
aVand measure your galvanic skin response,
p165
aVand show pictures on the screen,
p166
aVI can measure how you sweat when you see an object,
p167
aVlike a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.
p168
aVIf I show you a picture of a lion, or a tiger, or a pinup, you start sweating, right?
p169
aVAnd, believe it or not, if I show you a picture of your mother \u2014
p170
aVI'm talking about normal people \u2014 you start sweating.
p171
aVYou don't even have to be Jewish.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, what happens if you show this patient?
p175
aVYou take the patient and show him pictures on the screen
p176
aVand measure his galvanic skin response.
p177
aVTables and chairs and lint, nothing happens, as in normal people,
p178
aVbut when you show him a picture of his mother,
p179
aVthe galvanic skin response is flat.
p180
aVThere's no emotional reaction to his mother,
p181
aVbecause that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut.
p182
aVSo his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal,
p183
aVhis emotions are normal \u2014 he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth \u2014
p184
aVbut the wire from vision to emotions is cut
p185
aVand therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor.
p186
aVIt's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do:
p187
aVtake a bizarre, seemingly incomprehensible, neural psychiatric syndrome
p188
aVand say that the standard Freudian view is wrong,
p189
aVthat, in fact, you can come up with a precise explanation
p190
aVin terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain.
p191
aa(lp192
VBy the way, if this patient then goes,
p193
aVand mother phones from an adjacent room \u2014 phones him \u2014
p194
aVand he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?"
p195
aVThere's no delusion through the phone.
p196
aVThen, she approaches him after an hour, he says, "Who are you?
p197
aVYou look just like my mother." OK?
p198
aVThe reason is there's a separate pathway
p199
aVgoing from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers,
p200
aVand that's not been cut by the accident.
p201
aVSo this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.
p202
aVWhen he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor.
p203
aa(lp204
VOK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain?
p205
aVIs it nature, genes, or is it nurture?
p206
aVAnd we approach this problem
p207
aVby considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb.
p208
aVAnd you all know what a phantom limb is.
p209
aVWhen an arm is amputated, or a leg is amputated, for gangrene,
p210
aVor you lose it in war \u2014 for example, in the Iraq war,
p211
aVit's now a serious problem \u2014
p212
aVyou continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm,
p213
aVand that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg.
p214
aVIn fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.
p215
aVBelieve it or not, even with internal viscera.
p216
aVI've had patients with the uterus removed \u2014 hysterectomy \u2014
p217
aVwho have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps
p218
aVat the appropriate time of the month.
p219
aVAnd in fact, one student asked me the other day,
p220
aV"Do they get phantom PMS?"
p221
aV(Laughter)
p222
aVA subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that.
p223
aa(lp224
VOK, now the next question is,
p225
aVwhat can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?
p226
aVOne of the things we've found was,
p227
aVabout half the patients with phantom limbs
p228
aVclaim that they can move the phantom.
p229
aVIt'll pat his brother on the shoulder,
p230
aVit'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.
p231
aVThese are very compelling, vivid sensations.
p232
aVThe patient's not delusional.
p233
aVHe knows that the arm is not there,
p234
aVbut, nevertheless, it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient.
p235
aVBut however, about half the patients, this doesn't happen.
p236
aVThe phantom limb \u2014 they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.
p237
aVIt's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.
p238
aVIf only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved."
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?
p241
aVIt sounds like an oxymoron.
p242
aVBut when we were looking at the case sheets, what we found was,
p243
aVthese people with the paralyzed phantom limbs,
p244
aVthe original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury.
p245
aVThe actual nerve supplying the arm was severed,
p246
aVwas cut, by say, a motorcycle accident.
p247
aVSo the patient had an actual arm, which is painful,
p248
aVin a sling for a few months or a year, and then,
p249
aVin a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm,
p250
aVthe surgeon amputates the arm,
p251
aVand then you get a phantom arm with the same pains, right?
p252
aVAnd this is a serious clinical problem.
p253
aVPatients become depressed.
p254
aVSome of them are driven to suicide, OK?
p255
aa(lp256
VSo, how do you treat this syndrome?
p257
aVNow, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?
p258
aVWhen I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm,
p259
aVand the nerves supplying the arm had been cut,
p260
aVand the actual arm had been paralyzed,
p261
aVand lying in a sling for several months before the amputation,
p262
aVand this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself.
p263
aa(lp264
VWhy does this happen?
p265
aVWhen the arm was intact, but paralyzed,
p266
aVthe brain sends commands to the arm, the front of the brain, saying, "Move,"
p267
aVbut it's getting visual feedback saying, "No."
p268
aVMove. No. Move. No. Move. No.
p269
aVAnd this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain,
p270
aVand we call this learned paralysis, OK?
p271
aVThe brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link,
p272
aVthat the mere command to move the arm
p273
aVcreates a sensation of a paralyzed arm.
p274
aVAnd then, when you've amputated the arm,
p275
aVthis learned paralysis carries over into your body image
p276
aVand into your phantom, OK?
p277
aa(lp278
VNow, how do you help these patients?
p279
aVHow do you unlearn the learned paralysis,
p280
aVso you can relieve him of this excruciating, clenching spasm
p281
aVof the phantom arm?
p282
aVWell, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom,
p283
aVbut give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right?
p284
aVMaybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.
p285
aVHow do you do that? Well, virtual reality.
p286
aVBut that costs millions of dollars.
p287
aVSo, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars,
p288
aVbut don't tell my funding agencies.
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VOK? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box.
p292
aVYou have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle,
p293
aVand then you put the phantom \u2014 so my first patient, Derek, came in.
p294
aVHe had his arm amputated 10 years ago.
p295
aVHe had a brachial avulsion, so the nerves were cut
p296
aVand the arm was paralyzed, lying in a sling for a year, and then the arm was amputated.
p297
aVHe had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it.
p298
aVIt was a paralyzed phantom arm.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo he came there, and I gave him a mirror like that, in a box,
p301
aVwhich I call a mirror box, right?
p302
aVAnd the patient puts his phantom left arm,
p303
aVwhich is clenched and in spasm, on the left side of the mirror,
p304
aVand the normal hand on the right side of the mirror,
p305
aVand makes the same posture, the clenched posture,
p306
aVand looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience?
p307
aVHe looks at the phantom being resurrected,
p308
aVbecause he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror,
p309
aVand it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.
p310
aV"Now," I said, "now, look, wiggle your phantom \u2014
p311
aVyour real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror."
p312
aVHe's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving, right?
p313
aVThat's obvious, but the astonishing thing is,
p314
aVthe patient then says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again,
p315
aVand the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved."
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd remember, my first patient who came in \u2014
p318
aV(Applause)
p319
aV\u2014 thank you. (Applause)
p320
aVMy first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror,
p321
aVand I said, "Look at your reflection of your phantom."
p322
aVAnd he started giggling, he says, "I can see my phantom."
p323
aVBut he's not stupid. He knows it's not real.
p324
aVHe knows it's a mirror reflection,
p325
aVbut it's a vivid sensory experience.
p326
aVNow, I said, "Move your normal hand and phantom."
p327
aVHe said, "Oh, I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful."
p328
aVI said, "Move your normal hand."
p329
aVAnd he says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this!
p330
aVAnd my pain is being relieved." OK?
p331
aVAnd then I said, "Close your eyes."
p332
aVHe closes his eyes.
p333
aV"And move your normal hand."
p334
aV"Oh, nothing. It's clenched again."
p335
aV"OK, open your eyes."
p336
aV"Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!"
p337
aVSo, he was like a kid in a candy store.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo, I said, OK, this proves my theory about learned paralysis
p340
aVand the critical role of visual input,
p341
aVbut I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize
p342
aVfor getting somebody to move his phantom limb.
p343
aV(Laughter)
p344
aV(Applause)
p345
aVIt's a completely useless ability, if you think about it.
p346
aV(Laughter)
p347
aVBut then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis
p348
aVthat you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias \u2014
p349
aVthere may be a learned component to this,
p350
aVwhich you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo, I said, "Look, Derek" \u2014
p353
aVwell, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain \u2014
p354
aVI said, "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two.
p355
aVMaybe, after a period of practice,
p356
aVyou can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis,
p357
aVand start moving your paralyzed arm,
p358
aVand then, relieve yourself of pain."
p359
aVSo he said OK, and he took it home.
p360
aVI said, "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home."
p361
aa(lp362
VSo, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me,
p363
aVand he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this."
p364
aVI said, "What?"
p365
aVHe said, "It's gone."
p366
aVI said, "What's gone?"
p367
aVI thought maybe the mirror box was gone.
p368
aV(Laughter)
p369
aVHe said, "No, no, no, you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years?
p370
aVIt's disappeared."
p371
aVAnd I said \u2014 I got worried, I said, my God,
p372
aVI mean I've changed this guy's body image,
p373
aVwhat about human subjects, ethics and all of that?
p374
aVAnd I said, "Derek, does this bother you?"
p375
aVHe said, "No, last three days, I've not had a phantom arm
p376
aVand therefore no phantom elbow pain, no clenching,
p377
aVno phantom forearm pain, all those pains are gone away.
p378
aVBut the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder,
p379
aVand your box doesn't reach."
p380
aV(Laughter)
p381
aV"So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead,
p382
aVso I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?"
p383
aVHe thought I was some kind of magician.
p384
aa(lp385
VNow, why does this happen?
p386
aVIt's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.
p387
aVIt's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.
p388
aVOn the other hand, there's no proprioception,
p389
aVmuscle signals saying that there is no arm, right?
p390
aVAnd your motor command saying there is an arm,
p391
aVand, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it,
p392
aVthere is no phantom, there is no arm, right?
p393
aVIt goes into a sort of denial \u2014 it gates the signals.
p394
aVAnd when the arm disappears, the bonus is, the pain disappears
p395
aVbecause you can't have disembodied pain floating out there, in space.
p396
aVSo, that's the bonus.
p397
aa(lp398
VNow, this technique has been tried on dozens of patients
p399
aVby other groups in Helsinki,
p400
aVso it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain,
p401
aVand indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.
p402
aVStroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers,
p403
aVnothing you can do about it.
p404
aVBut, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis,
p405
aVand maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.
p406
aVThis has also gone through clinical trials,
p407
aVhelping lots and lots of patients.
p408
aa(lp409
VOK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk,
p410
aVwhich is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.
p411
aVThis was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.
p412
aVHe was a cousin of Charles Darwin.
p413
aVHe pointed out that certain people in the population,
p414
aVwho are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity:
p415
aVevery time they see a number, it's colored.
p416
aVFive is blue, seven is yellow, eight is chartreuse,
p417
aVnine is indigo, OK?
p418
aVBear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.
p419
aVOr C sharp \u2014 sometimes, tones evoke color.
p420
aVC sharp is blue, F sharp is green,
p421
aVanother tone might be yellow, right?
p422
aa(lp423
VWhy does this happen?
p424
aVThis is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia,
p425
aVa mingling of the senses.
p426
aVIn us, all the senses are distinct.
p427
aVThese people muddle up their senses.
p428
aVWhy does this happen?
p429
aVOne of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing.
p430
aVSynesthesia runs in families,
p431
aVso Galton said this is a hereditary basis, a genetic basis.
p432
aVSecondly, synesthesia is about \u2014 and this is what gets me to my point
p433
aVabout the main theme of this lecture, which is about creativity \u2014
p434
aVsynesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists
p435
aVand other creative people than in the general population.
p436
aVWhy would that be?
p437
aVI'm going to answer that question.
p438
aVIt's never been answered before.
p439
aa(lp440
VOK, what is synesthesia? What causes it?
p441
aVWell, there are many theories.
p442
aVOne theory is they're just crazy.
p443
aVNow, that's not really a scientific theory, so we can forget about it.
p444
aVAnother theory is they are acid junkies and potheads, right?
p445
aVNow, there may be some truth to this,
p446
aVbecause it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego.
p447
aV(Laughter)
p448
aVOK. Now, the third theory is that \u2014
p449
aVwell, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right?
p450
aa(lp451
VSo, we found that the color area and the number area
p452
aVare right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.
p453
aVSo we said, there's some accidental cross wiring
p454
aVbetween color and numbers in the brain.
p455
aVSo, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color,
p456
aVand that's why you get synesthesia.
p457
aVNow remember \u2014 why does this happen?
p458
aVWhy would there be crossed wires in some people?
p459
aVRemember I said it runs in families?
p460
aVThat gives you the clue.
p461
aVAnd that is, there is an abnormal gene,
p462
aVa mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring.
p463
aa(lp464
VIn all of us, it turns out
p465
aVwe are born with everything wired to everything else.
p466
aVSo, every brain region is wired to every other region,
p467
aVand these are trimmed down to create
p468
aVthe characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain.
p469
aVSo, if there's a gene causing this trimming
p470
aVand if that gene mutates,
p471
aVthen you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas.
p472
aVAnd if it's between number and color, you get number-color synesthesia.
p473
aVIf it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.
p474
aVSo far, so good.
p475
aa(lp476
VNow, what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain,
p477
aVso everything is cross-connected?
p478
aVWell, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common,
p479
aVthe ability to engage in metaphorical thinking,
p480
aVlinking seemingly unrelated ideas,
p481
aVsuch as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun."
p482
aVWell, you don't say, Juliet is the sun,
p483
aVdoes that mean she's a glowing ball of fire?
p484
aVI mean, schizophrenics do that, but it's a different story, right?
p485
aVNormal people say, she's warm like the sun,
p486
aVshe's radiant like the sun, she's nurturing like the sun.
p487
aVInstantly, you've found the links.
p488
aa(lp489
VNow, if you assume that this greater cross wiring
p490
aVand concepts are also in different parts of the brain,
p491
aVthen it's going to create a greater propensity
p492
aVtowards metaphorical thinking and creativity
p493
aVin people with synesthesia.
p494
aVAnd, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia
p495
aVamong poets, artists and novelists.
p496
aVOK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.
p497
aVThe last demonstration \u2014 can I take one minute?
p498
aV(Applause)
p499
aa(lp500
VOK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes, but you're in denial about it.
p501
aVHere's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet,
p502
aVA is A, B is B, C is C.
p503
aVDifferent shapes for different phonemes, right?
p504
aVHere, you've got Martian alphabet.
p505
aVOne of them is Kiki, one of them is Bouba.
p506
aVWhich one is Kiki and which one is Bouba?
p507
aVHow many of you think that's Kiki and that's Bouba? Raise your hands.
p508
aVWell, it's one or two mutants.
p509
aV(Laughter)
p510
aVHow many of you think that's Bouba, that's Kiki? Raise your hands.
p511
aVNinety-nine percent of you.
p512
aa(lp513
VNow, none of you is a Martian. How did you do that?
p514
aVIt's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction,
p515
aVmeaning you're saying that that sharp inflection \u2014 ki-ki,
p516
aVin your auditory cortex, the hair cells being excited \u2014 Kiki,
p517
aVmimics the visual inflection, sudden inflection of that jagged shape.
p518
aVNow, this is very important, because what it's telling you
p519
aVis your brain is engaging in a primitive \u2014
p520
aVit's just \u2014 it looks like a silly illusion,
p521
aVbut these photons in your eye are doing this shape,
p522
aVand hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern,
p523
aVbut the brain is able to extract the common denominator.
p524
aVIt's a primitive form of abstraction,
p525
aVand we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain,
p526
aVbecause when that's damaged,
p527
aVthese people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki,
p528
aVbut they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor.
p529
aa(lp530
VIf you ask this guy, what \u2014 "all that glitters is not gold,"
p531
aVwhat does that mean?"
p532
aVThe patient says, "Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold.
p533
aVYou have to measure its specific gravity, OK?"
p534
aVSo, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning.
p535
aVSo, this area is about eight times the size in higher \u2014
p536
aVespecially in humans \u2014 as in lower primates.
p537
aVSomething very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus,
p538
aVbecause it's the crossroads between hearing, vision and touch,
p539
aVand it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on.
p540
aVAnd I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities
p541
aVlike abstraction, metaphor and creativity.
p542
aVAll of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia,
p543
aVwe scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging,
p544
aVand by studying patients and asking the right questions.
p545
aVThank you.
p546
aV(Applause)
p547
aVSorry about that.

aV(Laughter)

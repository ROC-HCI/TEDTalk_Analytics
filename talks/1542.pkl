VIn half a century of trying to help prevent wars,
p5
aVthere's one question that never leaves me:
p6
aVHow do we deal with extreme violence
p7
aVwithout using force in return?
p8
aVWhen you're faced with brutality,
p9
aVwhether it's a child facing a bully on a playground
p10
aVor domestic violence \u2014
p11
aVor, on the streets of Syria today,
p12
aVfacing tanks and shrapnel,
p13
aVwhat's the most effective thing to do?
p14
aVFight back? Give in?
p15
aVUse more force?
p16
aa(lp17
VThis question: "How do I deal with a bully
p18
aVwithout becoming a thug in return?"
p19
aVhas been with me ever since I was a child.
p20
aVI remember I was about 13,
p21
aVglued to a grainy black and white television in my parents' living room
p22
aVas Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest,
p23
aVand kids not much older than me
p24
aVwere throwing themselves at the tanks
p25
aVand getting mown down.
p26
aVAnd I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd my mother came up and said, "What on Earth are you doing?"
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd I said, "I'm going to Budapest."
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd she said, "What on Earth for?"
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd I said, "Kids are getting killed there.
p35
aVThere's something terrible happening."
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd she said, "Don't be so silly."
p38
aVAnd I started to cry.
p39
aVAnd she got it, she said,
p40
aV"Okay, I see it's serious.
p41
aVYou're much too young to help.
p42
aVYou need training. I'll help you.
p43
aVBut just unpack your suitcase."
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd so I got some training
p46
aVand went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s.
p47
aVBut I realized that what I really needed to know
p48
aVI couldn't get from training courses.
p49
aVI wanted to understand
p50
aVhow violence, how oppression, works.
p51
aVAnd what I've discovered since is this:
p52
aVBullies use violence in three ways.
p53
aVThey use political violence to intimidate,
p54
aVphysical violence to terrorize
p55
aVand mental or emotional violence to undermine.
p56
aVAnd only very rarely in very few cases
p57
aVdoes it work to use more violence.
p58
aa(lp59
VNelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence,
p60
aVand 27 years later
p61
aVhe and his colleagues
p62
aVhad slowly and carefully
p63
aVhoned the skills, the incredible skills, that they needed
p64
aVto turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known
p65
aVinto a democracy.
p66
aVAnd they did it in a total devotion to non-violence.
p67
aVThey realized that using force against force
p68
aVdoesn't work.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo what does work?
p71
aVOver time I've collected about a half-dozen methods
p72
aVthat do work \u2014 of course there are many more \u2014
p73
aVthat do work and that are effective.
p74
aVAnd the first is
p75
aVthat the change that has to take place
p76
aVhas to take place here, inside me.
p77
aVIt's my response, my attitude, to oppression
p78
aVthat I've got control over,
p79
aVand that I can do something about.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that.
p82
aVThat means I need to know how I tick,
p83
aVwhen I collapse,
p84
aVwhere my formidable points are,
p85
aVwhere my weaker points are.
p86
aVWhen do I give in?
p87
aVWhat will I stand up for?
p88
aVAnd meditation or self-inspection
p89
aVis one of the ways \u2014 again it's not the only one \u2014
p90
aVit's one of the ways
p91
aVof gaining this kind of inner power.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd my heroine here \u2014 like Satish's \u2014
p94
aVis Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma.
p95
aVShe was leading a group of students
p96
aVon a protest in the streets of Rangoon.
p97
aVThey came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns.
p98
aVAnd she realized straight away
p99
aVthat the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers
p100
aVwere more scared than the student protesters behind her.
p101
aVBut she told the students to sit down.
p102
aVAnd she walked forward with such calm and such clarity
p103
aVand such total lack of fear
p104
aVthat she could walk right up to the first gun,
p105
aVput her hand on it and lower it.
p106
aVAnd no one got killed.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo that's what the mastery of fear can do \u2014
p109
aVnot only faced with machine guns,
p110
aVbut if you meet a knife fight in the street.
p111
aVBut we have to practice.
p112
aVSo what about our fear?
p113
aVI have a little mantra.
p114
aVMy fear grows fat
p115
aVon the energy I feed it.
p116
aVAnd if it grows very big
p117
aVit probably happens.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome,
p120
aVwhen something you've been worrying about wakes you up \u2014
p121
aVI see a lot of people \u2014
p122
aVand for an hour you toss and turn,
p123
aVit gets worse and worse,
p124
aVand by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow
p125
aVby a monster this big.
p126
aVThe only thing to do
p127
aVis to get up, make a cup of tea
p128
aVand sit down with the fear like a child beside you.
p129
aVYou're the adult.
p130
aVThe fear is the child.
p131
aVAnd you talk to the fear
p132
aVand you ask it what it wants, what it needs.
p133
aVHow can this be made better?
p134
aVHow can the child feel stronger?
p135
aVAnd you make a plan.
p136
aVAnd you say, "Okay, now we're going back to sleep.
p137
aVHalf-past seven, we're getting up and that's what we're going to do."
p138
aa(lp139
VI had one of these 3 a.m. episodes on Sunday \u2014
p140
aVparalyzed with fear at coming to talk to you.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aVSo I did the thing.
p143
aVI got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it, did it all
p144
aVand I'm here \u2014 still partly paralyzed, but I'm here.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Applause)
p147
aa(lp148
VSo that's fear. What about anger?
p149
aVWherever there is injustice there's anger.
p150
aVBut anger is like gasoline,
p151
aVand if you spray it around and somebody lights a match,
p152
aVyou've got an inferno.
p153
aVBut anger as an engine \u2014 in an engine \u2014 is powerful.
p154
aVIf we can put our anger inside an engine,
p155
aVit can drive us forward,
p156
aVit can get us through the dreadful moments
p157
aVand it can give us real inner power.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd I learned this in my work
p160
aVwith nuclear weapon policy-makers.
p161
aVBecause at the beginning I was so outraged
p162
aVat the dangers they were exposing us to
p163
aVthat I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong.
p164
aVTotally ineffective.
p165
aVIn order to develop a dialogue for change
p166
aVwe have to deal with our anger.
p167
aVIt's okay to be angry with the thing \u2014
p168
aVthe nuclear weapons in this case \u2014
p169
aVbut it is hopeless to be angry with the people.
p170
aVThey are human beings just like us.
p171
aVAnd they're doing what they think is best.
p172
aVAnd that's the basis on which we have to talk with them.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo that's the third one, anger.
p175
aVAnd it brings me to the crux
p176
aVof what's going on, or what I perceive as going on,
p177
aVin the world today,
p178
aVwhich is that last century was top-down power.
p179
aVIt was still governments telling people what to do.
p180
aVThis century there's a shift.
p181
aVIt's bottom-up or grassroots power.
p182
aVIt's like mushrooms coming through concrete.
p183
aVIt's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away
p184
aVto bring about change.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd Peace Direct spotted quite early on
p187
aVthat local people in areas of very hot conflict
p188
aVknow what to do.
p189
aVThey know best what to do.
p190
aVSo Peace Direct gets behind them to do that.
p191
aVAnd the kind of thing they're doing
p192
aVis demobilizing militias,
p193
aVrebuilding economies,
p194
aVresettling refugees,
p195
aVeven liberating child soldiers.
p196
aVAnd they have to risk their lives almost every day
p197
aVto do this.
p198
aVAnd what they've realized
p199
aVis that using violence in the situations they operate in
p200
aVis not only less humane,
p201
aVbut it's less effective
p202
aVthan using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd I think that the U.S. military
p205
aVis finally beginning to get this.
p206
aVUp to now their counter-terrorism policy
p207
aVhas been to kill insurgents at almost any cost,
p208
aVand if civilians get in the way,
p209
aVthat's written as "collateral damage."
p210
aVAnd this is so infuriating and humiliating
p211
aVfor the population of Afghanistan,
p212
aVthat it makes the recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy,
p213
aVwhen people are so disgusted by, for example,
p214
aVthe burning of the Koran.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo the training of the troops has to change.
p217
aVAnd I think there are signs that it is beginning to change.
p218
aVThe British military have always been much better at this.
p219
aVBut there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from,
p220
aVand that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel
p221
aVcalled Chris Hughes.
p222
aVAnd he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf \u2014
p223
aVin Iraq actually \u2014
p224
aVand suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road,
p225
aVscreaming, yelling, furiously angry,
p226
aVand surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified,
p227
aVdidn't know what was going on, couldn't speak Arabic.
p228
aVAnd Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng
p229
aVwith his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground,
p230
aVand he said, "Kneel."
p231
aVAnd these huge soldiers
p232
aVwith their backpacks and their body armor,
p233
aVwobbled to the ground.
p234
aVAnd complete silence fell.
p235
aVAnd after about two minutes,
p236
aVeverybody moved aside and went home.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow that to me is wisdom in action.
p239
aVIn the moment, that's what he did.
p240
aVAnd it's happening everywhere now.
p241
aVYou don't believe me?
p242
aVHave you asked yourselves
p243
aVwhy and how so many dictatorships have collapsed
p244
aVover the last 30 years?
p245
aVDictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
p246
aVEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
p247
aVMali, Madagascar,
p248
aVPoland, the Philippines,
p249
aVSerbia, Slovenia, I could go on,
p250
aVand now Tunisia and Egypt.
p251
aVAnd this hasn't just happened.
p252
aVA lot of it is due to a book
p253
aVwritten by an 80-year-old man in Boston, Gene Sharp.
p254
aVHe wrote a book called "From Dictatorship to Democracy"
p255
aVwith 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance.
p256
aVAnd it's been translated into 26 languages.
p257
aVIt's flown around the world.
p258
aVAnd it's being used by young people and older people everywhere,
p259
aVbecause it works and it's effective.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo this is what gives me hope \u2014
p262
aVnot just hope, this is what makes me feel very positive right now.
p263
aVBecause finally human beings are getting it.
p264
aVWe're getting practical, doable methodologies
p265
aVto answer my question:
p266
aVHow do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug?
p267
aVWe're using the kind of skills that I've outlined:
p268
aVinner power \u2014 the development of inner power \u2014 through self-knowledge,
p269
aVrecognizing and working with our fear,
p270
aVusing anger as a fuel,
p271
aVcooperating with others,
p272
aVbanding together with others,
p273
aVcourage,
p274
aVand most importantly, commitment to active non-violence.
p275
aa(lp276
VNow I don't just believe in non-violence.
p277
aVI don't have to believe in it.
p278
aVI see evidence everywhere of how it works.
p279
aVAnd I see that we, ordinary people,
p280
aVcan do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did.
p281
aVWe can bring to an end
p282
aVthe bloodiest century that humanity has ever known.
p283
aVAnd we can organize to overcome oppression
p284
aVby opening our hearts
p285
aVas well as strengthening this incredible resolve.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd this open-heartedness is exactly what I've experienced
p288
aVin the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday.
p289
aVThank you.

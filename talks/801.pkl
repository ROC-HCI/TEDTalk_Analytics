VI'm going to speak today about the relationship
p5
aVbetween science and human values.
p6
aVNow, it's generally understood that
p7
aVquestions of morality \u2014
p8
aVquestions of good and evil and right and wrong \u2014
p9
aVare questions about which science officially has no opinion.
p10
aVIt's thought that science can help us
p11
aVget what we value,
p12
aVbut it can never tell us what we ought to value.
p13
aVAnd, consequently, most people \u2014 I think most people
p14
aVprobably here \u2014 think that science will never answer
p15
aVthe most important questions in human life:
p16
aVquestions like, "What is worth living for?"
p17
aV"What is worth dying for?"
p18
aV"What constitutes a good life?"
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, I'm going to argue
p21
aVthat this is an illusion \u2014 that the separation between
p22
aVscience and human values is an illusion \u2014
p23
aVand actually quite a dangerous one
p24
aVat this point in human history.
p25
aVNow, it's often said that science
p26
aVcannot give us a foundation for morality and human values,
p27
aVbecause science deals with facts,
p28
aVand facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.
p29
aVIt's often thought that there's no description
p30
aVof the way the world is
p31
aVthat can tell us how the world ought to be.
p32
aVBut I think this is quite clearly untrue.
p33
aVValues are a certain kind of fact.
p34
aVThey are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhy is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?
p37
aVWhy don't we feel compassion for rocks?
p38
aVIt's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more
p39
aVconcerned about our fellow primates
p40
aVthan we are about insects, as indeed we are,
p41
aVit's because we think they're exposed to a greater range
p42
aVof potential happiness and suffering.
p43
aVNow, the crucial thing to notice here
p44
aVis that this is a factual claim:
p45
aVThis is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we
p46
aVhave misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity
p47
aVand the possibilities of experience
p48
aVwell then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd there's no notion,
p51
aVno version of human morality
p52
aVand human values that I've ever come across
p53
aVthat is not at some point reducible
p54
aVto a concern about conscious experience
p55
aVand its possible changes.
p56
aVEven if you get your values from religion,
p57
aVeven if you think that good and evil ultimately
p58
aVrelate to conditions after death \u2014
p59
aVeither to an eternity of happiness with God
p60
aVor an eternity of suffering in hell \u2014
p61
aVyou are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.
p62
aVAnd to say that such changes can persist after death
p63
aVis itself a factual claim,
p64
aVwhich, of course, may or may not be true.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, to speak about the conditions of well-being
p67
aVin this life, for human beings,
p68
aVwe know that there is a continuum of such facts.
p69
aVWe know that it's possible to live in a failed state,
p70
aVwhere everything that can go wrong does go wrong \u2014
p71
aVwhere mothers cannot feed their children,
p72
aVwhere strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,
p73
aVwhere people are murdered indiscriminately.
p74
aVAnd we know that it's possible to move along this continuum
p75
aVtowards something quite a bit more idyllic,
p76
aVto a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd we know \u2014 we know \u2014
p79
aVthat there are right and wrong answers
p80
aVto how to move in this space.
p81
aVWould adding cholera to the water be a good idea?
p82
aVProbably not.
p83
aVWould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye,
p84
aVso that when bad things happened to them
p85
aVthey immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.
p86
aVThere are truths to be known
p87
aVabout how human communities flourish,
p88
aVwhether or not we understand these truths.
p89
aVAnd morality relates to these truths.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo, in talking about values we are talking about facts.
p92
aVNow, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels \u2014
p93
aVfrom the level of the genome
p94
aVon up to the level of economic systems
p95
aVand political arrangements.
p96
aVBut if we're going to talk about human well-being
p97
aVwe are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.
p98
aVBecause we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it
p99
aVis realized in the brain \u2014
p100
aa(lp101
Vwhatever happens after death.
p102
aVEven if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,
p103
aVin this life, his personality \u2014
p104
aVhis rather unfortunate personality \u2014
p105
aVis the product of his brain.
p106
aVSo the contributions of culture \u2014
p107
aVif culture changes us, as indeed it does,
p108
aVit changes us by changing our brains.
p109
aVAnd so therefore whatever cultural variation there is
p110
aVin how human beings flourish
p111
aVcan, at least in principle, be understood
p112
aVin the context of a maturing science of the mind \u2014
p113
aVneuroscience, psychology, etc.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo, what I'm arguing is that
p116
aVvalue's reduced to facts \u2014
p117
aVto facts about the conscious experience
p118
aVof conscious beings.
p119
aVAnd we can therefore visualize a space
p120
aVof possible changes in the experience of these beings.
p121
aVAnd I think of this as kind of a moral landscape,
p122
aVwith peaks and valleys that correspond
p123
aVto differences in the well-being of conscious creatures,
p124
aVboth personal and collective.
p125
aVAnd one thing to notice is that perhaps
p126
aVthere are states of human well-being
p127
aVthat we rarely access, that few people access.
p128
aVAnd these await our discovery.
p129
aVPerhaps some of these states can be appropriately called
p130
aVmystical or spiritual.
p131
aVPerhaps there are other states that we can't access
p132
aVbecause of how our minds are structured
p133
aVbut other minds possibly could access them.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying
p136
aVthat science is guaranteed to map this space,
p137
aVor that we will have scientific answers to every
p138
aVconceivable moral question.
p139
aVI don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult
p140
aVa supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child,
p141
aVor whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities,
p142
aVor whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVBut if questions affect human well-being
p145
aVthen they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.
p146
aVAnd just admitting this \u2014
p147
aVjust admitting that there are right and wrong answers
p148
aVto the question of how humans flourish \u2014
p149
aVwill change the way we talk about morality,
p150
aVand will change our expectations
p151
aVof human cooperation in the future.
p152
aa(lp153
VFor instance, there are 21 states in our country
p154
aVwhere corporal punishment in the classroom is legal,
p155
aVwhere it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard,
p156
aVand raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.
p157
aVAnd hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally,
p158
aVare subjected to this every year.
p159
aVThe locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.
p160
aVWe're not talking about Connecticut.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.
p163
aVThe creator of the universe himself
p164
aVhas told us not to spare the rod,
p165
aVlest we spoil the child \u2014
p166
aVthis is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.
p167
aVBut we can ask the obvious question:
p168
aVIs it a good idea, generally speaking,
p169
aVto subject children to pain
p170
aVand violence and public humiliation
p171
aVas a way of encouraging healthy emotional development
p172
aVand good behavior?
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVIs there any doubt
p175
aVthat this question has an answer,
p176
aVand that it matters?
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, many of you might worry
p179
aVthat the notion of well-being is truly undefined,
p180
aVand seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.
p181
aVAnd so, how therefore can there be an
p182
aVobjective notion of well-being?
p183
aVWell, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.
p184
aVThe concept of physical health is undefined.
p185
aVAs we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.
p186
aVWhen this statue was carved
p187
aVthe average life expectancy was probably 30.
p188
aVIt's now around 80 in the developed world.
p189
aVThere may come a time when we meddle with our genomes
p190
aVin such a way that not being able to run a marathon
p191
aVat age 200 will be considered a profound disability.
p192
aVPeople will send you donations when you're in that condition.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VNotice that the fact that the concept of health
p196
aVis open, genuinely open for revision,
p197
aVdoes not make it vacuous.
p198
aVThe distinction between a healthy person
p199
aVand a dead one
p200
aVis about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.
p201
aVAnother thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:
p202
aVThere may be equivalent ways to thrive;
p203
aVthere may be equivalent ways to organize a human society
p204
aVso as to maximize human flourishing.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, why wouldn't this
p207
aVundermine an objective morality?
p208
aVWell think of how we talk about food:
p209
aVI would never be tempted to argue to you
p210
aVthat there must be one right food to eat.
p211
aVThere is clearly a range of materials
p212
aVthat constitute healthy food.
p213
aVBut there's nevertheless a clear distinction
p214
aVbetween food and poison.
p215
aVThe fact that there are many right answers
p216
aVto the question, "What is food?"
p217
aVdoes not tempt us
p218
aVto say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.
p219
aVMany people worry
p220
aVthat a universal morality would require
p221
aVmoral precepts that admit of no exceptions.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie,
p224
aVit must always be wrong to lie,
p225
aVand if you can find an exception,
p226
aVwell then there's no such thing as moral truth.
p227
aVWhy would we think this?
p228
aVConsider, by analogy, the game of chess.
p229
aVNow, if you're going to play good chess,
p230
aVa principle like, "Don't lose your Queen,"
p231
aVis very good to follow.
p232
aVBut it clearly admits some exceptions.
p233
aVThere are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.
p234
aVThere are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.
p235
aVAnd yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.
p236
aVThe fact that there are exceptions here does not
p237
aVchange that at all.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow, this brings us to the sorts of moves
p240
aVthat people are apt to make in the moral sphere.
p241
aVConsider the great problem of women's bodies:
p242
aVWhat to do about them?
p243
aVWell this is one thing you can do about them:
p244
aVYou can cover them up.
p245
aVNow, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community
p246
aVthat while we may not like this,
p247
aVwe might think of this as "wrong"
p248
aVin Boston or Palo Alto,
p249
aVwho are we to say
p250
aVthat the proud denizens of an ancient culture
p251
aVare wrong to force their wives and daughters
p252
aVto live in cloth bags?
p253
aVAnd who are we to say, even, that they're wrong
p254
aVto beat them with lengths of steel cable,
p255
aVor throw battery acid in their faces
p256
aVif they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?
p257
aa(lp258
VWell, who are we not to say this?
p259
aVWho are we to pretend
p260
aVthat we know so little about human well-being
p261
aVthat we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?
p262
aVI'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil \u2014
p263
aVwomen should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.
p264
aVBut what does voluntary mean
p265
aVin a community where,
p266
aVwhen a girl gets raped,
p267
aVher father's first impulse,
p268
aVrather often, is to murder her out of shame?
p269
aa(lp270
VJust let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute:
p271
aVYour daughter gets raped,
p272
aVand what you want to do is kill her.
p273
aVWhat are the chances that represents
p274
aVa peak of human flourishing?
p275
aa(lp276
VNow, to say this is not to say that we have got the
p277
aVperfect solution in our own society.
p278
aVFor instance,
p279
aVthis is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere
p280
aVin the civilized world.
p281
aVNow, granted, for many men
p282
aVit may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.
p283
aV(Laughter)
p284
aVBut if we are in a reflective mood,
p285
aVwe can ask,
p286
aV"Is this the perfect expression
p287
aVof psychological balance
p288
aVwith respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?"
p289
aVI mean, is this the optimal environment
p290
aVin which to raise our children?
p291
aVProbably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place
p292
aVon the spectrum
p293
aVbetween these two extremes
p294
aVthat represents a place of better balance.
p295
aV(Applause)
p296
aVPerhaps there are many such places \u2014
p297
aa(lp298
Vagain, given other changes in human culture
p299
aVthere may be many peaks on the moral landscape.
p300
aVBut the thing to notice is that there will be
p301
aVmany more ways not to be on a peak.
p302
aVNow the irony, from my perspective,
p303
aVis that the only people who seem to generally agree with me
p304
aVand who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions
p305
aVare religious demagogues of one form or another.
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd of course they think they have right answers to moral questions
p308
aVbecause they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind,
p309
aVnot because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes
p310
aVand condition of human and animal well-being.
p311
aVIn fact, the endurance of religion
p312
aVas a lens through which most people view moral questions
p313
aVhas separated most moral talk
p314
aVfrom real questions of human and animal suffering.
p315
aVThis is why we spend our time
p316
aVtalking about things like gay marriage
p317
aVand not about genocide or nuclear proliferation
p318
aVor poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.
p319
aVBut the demagogues are right about one thing: We need
p320
aVa universal conception of human values.
p321
aa(lp322
VNow, what stands in the way of this?
p323
aVWell, one thing to notice is that we
p324
aVdo something different when talking about morality \u2014
p325
aVespecially secular, academic, scientist types.
p326
aVWhen talking about morality we value differences of opinion
p327
aVin a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.
p328
aVSo, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning
p329
aVmeditating on compassion,
p330
aVand he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component
p331
aVof human happiness.
p332
aVOn the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;
p333
aVTed Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping
p334
aVand torturing and killing young women.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion
p337
aVabout how to profitably use one's time.
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aVMost Western intellectuals
p340
aVlook at this situation
p341
aVand say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama
p342
aVto be really right about \u2014 really right about \u2014
p343
aVor for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about
p344
aVthat admits of a real argument
p345
aVthat potentially falls within the purview of science.
p346
aVHe likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.
p347
aVThere's nothing that one should be able to say to the other
p348
aVthat should persuade the other."
p349
aVNotice that we don't do this in science.
p350
aa(lp351
VOn the left you have Edward Witten.
p352
aVHe's a string theorist.
p353
aVIf you ask the smartest physicists around
p354
aVwho is the smartest physicist around,
p355
aVin my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.
p356
aVThe other half will tell you they don't like the question.
p357
aV(Laughter)
p358
aVSo, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference
p359
aVand said,"String theory is bogus.
p360
aVIt doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to
p361
aVview the universe at a small scale.
p362
aVI'm not a fan."
p363
aV(Laughter)
p364
aVWell, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist;
p365
aVI don't understand string theory.
p366
aVI'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aVI wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.
p369
aa(lp370
VBut this is just the point.
p371
aVWhenever we are talking about facts
p372
aVcertain opinions must be excluded.
p373
aVThat is what it is to have a domain of expertise.
p374
aVThat is what it is for knowledge to count.
p375
aVHow have we convinced ourselves
p376
aVthat in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise,
p377
aVor moral talent, or moral genius even?
p378
aVHow have we convinced ourselves
p379
aVthat every opinion has to count?
p380
aVHow have we convinced ourselves
p381
aVthat every culture has a point of view
p382
aVon these subjects worth considering?
p383
aVDoes the Taliban
p384
aVhave a point of view on physics
p385
aVthat is worth considering? No.
p386
aV(Laughter)
p387
aVHow is their ignorance any less obvious
p388
aVon the subject of human well-being?
p389
aV(Applause)
p390
aa(lp391
VSo, this, I think, is what the world needs now.
p392
aVIt needs people like ourselves to admit
p393
aVthat there are right and wrong answers
p394
aVto questions of human flourishing,
p395
aVand morality relates
p396
aVto that domain of facts.
p397
aVIt is possible
p398
aVfor individuals, and even for whole cultures,
p399
aVto care about the wrong things,
p400
aVwhich is to say that it's possible for them
p401
aVto have beliefs and desires that reliably lead
p402
aVto needless human suffering.
p403
aVJust admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.
p404
aVWe live in a world in which
p405
aVthe boundaries between nations mean less and less,
p406
aVand they will one day mean nothing.
p407
aa(lp408
VWe live in a world filled with destructive technology,
p409
aVand this technology cannot be uninvented;
p410
aVit will always be easier
p411
aVto break things than to fix them.
p412
aVIt seems to me, therefore, patently obvious
p413
aVthat we can no more
p414
aVrespect and tolerate
p415
aVvast differences in notions of human well-being
p416
aVthan we can respect or tolerate vast differences
p417
aVin the notions about how disease spreads,
p418
aVor in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.
p419
aVWe simply must converge
p420
aVon the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.
p421
aVAnd to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.
p422
aVThank you very much.
p423
aV(Applause)
p424
aa(lp425
VChris Anderson: So, some combustible material there.
p426
aVWhether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world,
p427
aVhearing some of this, may well be doing the
p428
aVscreaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.
p429
aa(lp430
VLanguage seems to be really important here.
p431
aVWhen you're talking about the veil,
p432
aVyou're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.
p433
aVI've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.
p434
aVAnd some of them would say something else. They would say,
p435
aV"No, you know, this is a celebration
p436
aVof female specialness,
p437
aVit helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" \u2014
p438
aVand this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view \u2014
p439
aV"that male lust is not to be trusted."
p440
aVI mean, can you engage in a conversation
p441
aVwith that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?
p442
aa(lp443
VSam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence,
p444
aVwatching the clock ticking,
p445
aVbut the question is:
p446
aVWhat is voluntary in a context
p447
aVwhere men have certain expectations,
p448
aVand you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way
p449
aVif you don't veil yourself?
p450
aVAnd so, if anyone in this room
p451
aVwanted to wear a veil,
p452
aVor a very funny hat, or tattoo their face \u2014
p453
aVI think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want,
p454
aVbut we have to be honest about
p455
aVthe constraints that these women are placed under.
p456
aVAnd so I think we shouldn't be so eager
p457
aVto always take their word for it,
p458
aVespecially when it's 120 degrees out
p459
aVand you're wearing a full burqa.
p460
aa(lp461
VCA: A lot of people want to believe in this
p462
aVconcept of moral progress.
p463
aVBut can you reconcile that?
p464
aVI think I understood you to say that you could
p465
aVreconcile that with a world that doesn't become
p466
aVone dimensional, where we all have to think the same.
p467
aVPaint your picture of what
p468
aVrolling the clock 50 years forward,
p469
aV100 years forward, how you would like to think of
p470
aVthe world, balancing moral progress
p471
aVwith richness.
p472
aa(lp473
VSH: Well, I think once you admit
p474
aVthat we are on the path toward understanding our minds
p475
aVat the level of the brain in some important detail,
p476
aVthen you have to admit
p477
aVthat we are going to understand all of the positive
p478
aVand negative qualities
p479
aVof ourselves in much greater detail.
p480
aVSo, we're going to understand positive social emotion
p481
aVlike empathy and compassion,
p482
aVand we're going to understand the factors
p483
aVthat encourage it \u2014 whether they're genetic,
p484
aVwhether they're how people talk to one another,
p485
aVwhether they're economic systems,
p486
aVand insofar as we begin to shine light on that
p487
aVwe are inevitably going to converge
p488
aVon that fact space.
p489
aa(lp490
VSo, everything is not going to be up for grabs.
p491
aVIt's not going to be like
p492
aVveiling my daughter from birth
p493
aVis just as good as teaching her
p494
aVto be confident and well-educated
p495
aVin the context of men who do desire women.
p496
aVI mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know
p497
aVthat compulsory veiling is a bad idea \u2014
p498
aVbut at a certain point
p499
aVwe're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved
p500
aVand actually interrogate them.
p501
aVDo people love their daughters
p502
aVjust as much in these systems?
p503
aVAnd I think there are clearly right answers to that.
p504
aa(lp505
VCA: And if the results come out that actually they do,
p506
aVare you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment
p507
aVon some of these issues?
p508
aa(lp509
VSH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact,
p510
aVthat you can love someone
p511
aVin the context of a truly delusional belief system.
p512
aVSo, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son
p513
aVwas going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend,
p514
aVI chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."
p515
aVIf you get all those parts aligned,
p516
aVyes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.
p517
aVBut again, then we have to talk about
p518
aVwell-being in a larger context.
p519
aVIt's all of us in this together,
p520
aVnot one man feeling ecstasy
p521
aVand then blowing himself up on a bus.
p522
aa(lp523
VCA: Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to
p524
aVcontinue for hours.
p525
aVWe don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.
p526
aa(lp527
VSH: Really an honor. Thank you.
p528
aV(Applause)

VThere are times when I feel really quite ashamed
p5
aVto be a European.
p6
aVIn the last year,
p7
aVmore than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help,
p8
aVand our response, frankly, has been pathetic.
p9
aa(lp10
VThere are just so many contradictions.
p11
aVWe mourn the tragic death
p12
aVof two-year-old Alan Kurdi,
p13
aVand yet, since then, more than 200 children
p14
aVhave subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean.
p15
aVWe have international treaties
p16
aVthat recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility,
p17
aVand yet we accept that tiny Lebanon
p18
aVhosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined.
p19
aVWe lament the existence of human smugglers,
p20
aVand yet we make that the only viable route
p21
aVto seek asylum in Europe.
p22
aVWe have labor shortages,
p23
aVand yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs
p24
aVfrom coming to Europe.
p25
aVWe proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam,
p26
aVand yet \u2014
p27
aVwe have repressive policies
p28
aVthat detain child asylum seekers,
p29
aVthat separate children from their families,
p30
aVand that seize property from refugees.
p31
aa(lp32
VWhat are we doing?
p33
aVHow has the situation come to this,
p34
aVthat we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
p35
aa(lp36
VI don't believe it's because people don't care,
p37
aVor at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care.
p38
aVI believe it's because our politicians lack a vision,
p39
aVa vision for how to adapt an international refugee system
p40
aVcreated over 50 years ago
p41
aVfor a changing and globalized world.
p42
aVAnd so what I want to do is take a step back
p43
aVand ask two really fundamental questions,
p44
aVthe two questions we all need to ask.
p45
aVFirst, why is the current system not working?
p46
aVAnd second, what can we do to fix it?
p47
aa(lp48
VSo the modern refugee regime
p49
aVwas created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys.
p50
aVIts basic aim is to ensure
p51
aVthat when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people,
p52
aVpeople have somewhere to go,
p53
aVto live in safety and dignity until they can go home.
p54
aVIt was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today.
p55
aVThrough an international convention signed by 147 governments,
p56
aVthe 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees,
p57
aVand an international organization, UNHCR,
p58
aVstates committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory
p59
aVwho flee conflict and persecution.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut today, that system is failing.
p62
aVIn theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum.
p63
aVIn practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
p64
aVIn theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration,
p65
aVor return to the country they've come from.
p66
aVBut in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo.
p67
aVIn theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility.
p68
aVIn practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict
p69
aVtake the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees.
p70
aVThe system isn't broken because the rules are wrong.
p71
aVIt's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world,
p72
aVand that's what we need to reconsider.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
p75
aVHow does the refugee regime actually work?
p76
aVBut not from a top-down institutional perspective,
p77
aVrather from the perspective of a refugee.
p78
aVSo imagine a Syrian woman.
p79
aVLet's call her Amira.
p80
aVAnd Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region.
p81
aVAmira, like around 25 percent of the world's refugees,
p82
aVis a woman with children,
p83
aVand she can't go home because she comes from this city
p84
aVthat you see before you, Homs,
p85
aVa once beautiful and historic city
p86
aVnow under rubble.
p87
aVAnd so Amira can't go back there.
p88
aVBut Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country,
p89
aVbecause that's a lottery ticket
p90
aVonly available to less than one percent of the world's refugees.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo Amira and her family
p93
aVface an almost impossible choice.
p94
aVThey have three basic options.
p95
aVThe first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp.
p96
aVIn the camp, she might get assistance,
p97
aVbut there are very few prospects for Amira and her family.
p98
aVCamps are in bleak, arid locations,
p99
aVoften in the desert.
p100
aVIn the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,
p101
aVyou can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime.
p102
aVThere's restricted economic activity.
p103
aVEducation is often of poor quality.
p104
aVAnd around the world,
p105
aVsome 80 percent of refugees who are in camps
p106
aVhave to stay for at least five years.
p107
aVIt's a miserable existence,
p108
aVand that's probably why, in reality,
p109
aVonly nine percent of Syrians choose that option.
p110
aa(lp111
VAlternatively, Amira can head to an urban area
p112
aVin a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut.
p113
aVThat's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken.
p114
aVBut there, there's great difficulty as well.
p115
aVRefugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work.
p116
aVThey don't usually get significant access to assistance.
p117
aVAnd so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings,
p118
aVthey're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo there's a third alternative,
p121
aVand it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking.
p122
aVAmira can seek some hope for her family
p123
aVby risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey
p124
aVto another country,
p125
aVand it's that which we're seeing in Europe today.
p126
aa(lp127
VAround the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice
p128
aVbetween three options:
p129
aVencampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys.
p130
aVFor refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today.
p131
aVBut I think it's a false choice.
p132
aVI think we can reconsider that choice.
p133
aVThe reason why we limit those options
p134
aVis because we think
p135
aVthat those are the only options that are available to refugees,
p136
aVand they're not.
p137
aVPoliticians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue,
p138
aVthat if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens.
p139
aVWe tend to have a collective assumption
p140
aVthat refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society.
p141
aVBut they don't have to. They can contribute.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo what I want to argue
p144
aVis there are ways in which we can expand that choice set
p145
aVand still benefit everyone else:
p146
aVthe host states and communities,
p147
aVour societies and refugees themselves.
p148
aVAnd I want to suggest four ways
p149
aVwe can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees.
p150
aVAll four ways have one thing in common:
p151
aVthey're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization,
p152
aVmobility and markets,
p153
aVand update the way we think about the refugee issue.
p154
aa(lp155
VThe first one I want to think about
p156
aVis the idea of enabling environments,
p157
aVand it starts from a very basic recognition
p158
aVthat refugees are human beings like everyone else,
p159
aVbut they're just in extraordinary circumstances.
p160
aVTogether with my colleagues in Oxford,
p161
aVwe've embarked on a research project in Uganda
p162
aVlooking at the economic lives of refugees.
p163
aVWe chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries.
p164
aVIt's not. It's exceptional.
p165
aVUnlike most host countries around the world,
p166
aVwhat Uganda has done
p167
aVis give refugees economic opportunity.
p168
aVIt gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement.
p169
aVAnd the results of that are extraordinary
p170
aVboth for refugees and the host community.
p171
aVIn the capital city, Kampala,
p172
aVwe found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people,
p173
aVand 40 percent of those employees
p174
aVare nationals of the host country.
p175
aVIn other words, refugees are making jobs
p176
aVfor citizens of the host country.
p177
aVEven in the camps, we found extraordinary examples
p178
aVof vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses.
p179
aa(lp180
VFor example, in a settlement called Nakivale,
p181
aVwe found examples of Congolese refugees
p182
aVrunning digital music exchange businesses.
p183
aVWe found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available
p184
aVto allow the youth to play computer games
p185
aVon recycled games consoles and recycled televisions.
p186
aVAgainst the odds of extreme constraint,
p187
aVrefugees are innovating,
p188
aVand the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.
p189
aVDemou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little,
p190
aVbut he wanted to be a filmmaker.
p191
aVSo with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station,
p192
aVhe rented a video camera,
p193
aVand he's now making films.
p194
aVHe made two documentary films
p195
aVwith and for our team,
p196
aVand he's making a successful business out of very little.
p197
aVIt's those kinds of examples
p198
aVthat should guide our response to refugees.
p199
aVRather than seeing refugees
p200
aVas inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance,
p201
aVwe need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing.
p202
aa(lp203
VYes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food
p204
aVare all important in the emergency phase,
p205
aVbut we need to also look beyond that.
p206
aVWe need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity,
p207
aVeducation, the right to work,
p208
aVaccess to capital and banking.
p209
aVAll the ways in which we take for granted
p210
aVthat we are plugged in to the global economy
p211
aVcan and should apply to refugees.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.
p214
aVUnfortunately, not every host country in the world
p215
aVtakes the approach Uganda has taken.
p216
aVMost host countries don't open up their economies to refugees
p217
aVin the same way.
p218
aVBut there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use.
p219
aa(lp220
VLast April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague,
p221
aVthe development economist Paul Collier,
p222
aVand we brainstormed an idea while we were there
p223
aVwith the international community and the government,
p224
aVan idea to bring jobs to Syrians
p225
aVwhile supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
p226
aVThe idea is for an economic zone,
p227
aVone in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees
p228
aValongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals.
p229
aVAnd just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp,
p230
aVhome to 83,000 refugees,
p231
aVis an existing economic zone
p232
aVcalled the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area.
p233
aVThe government has spent over a hundred million dollars
p234
aVconnecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network,
p235
aVbut it lacked two things:
p236
aVaccess to labor and inward investment.
p237
aVSo what if refugees were able to work there
p238
aVrather than being stuck in camps,
p239
aVable to support their families and develop skills through vocational training
p240
aVbefore they go back to Syria?
p241
aVWe recognized that that could benefit Jordan,
p242
aVwhose development strategy requires it to make the leap
p243
aVas a middle income country to manufacturing.
p244
aVIt could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute
p245
aVto the postconflict reconstruction of Syria
p246
aVby recognizing that we need to incubate refugees
p247
aVas the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria.
p248
aa(lp249
VWe published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
p250
aVKing Abdullah has picked up on the idea.
p251
aVIt was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago,
p252
aVand a pilot will begin in the summer.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Applause)
p255
aa(lp256
VThe third idea that I want to put to you
p257
aVis preference matching between states and refugees
p258
aVto lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie
p259
aVfeaturing Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
p260
aVWhat we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go,
p261
aVbut I'd argue we can do that
p262
aVand still make everyone better off.
p263
aVThe economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets,
p264
aVways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match.
p265
aVMy colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym
p266
aVhave explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees,
p267
aVto ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations,
p268
aVbut also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want
p269
aVon skills criteria or language criteria
p270
aVand allow those to match.
p271
aVNow, of course you'd need to build in quotas
p272
aVon things like diversity and vulnerability,
p273
aVbut it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching.
p274
aVThe matching idea has been successfully used
p275
aVto match, for instance, students with university places,
p276
aVto match kidney donors with patients,
p277
aVand it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites.
p278
aVSo why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?
p279
aa(lp280
VIt could also be used at the national level,
p281
aVwhere one of the great challenges we face
p282
aVis to persuade local communities to accept refugees.
p283
aVAnd at the moment, in my country, for instance,
p284
aVwe often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities,
p285
aVwhich makes no sense at all.
p286
aVSo matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together
p287
aVand listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host
p288
aVand the refugees themselves.
p289
aa(lp290
VThe fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas.
p291
aVMuch of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe
p292
aVwas entirely avoidable.
p293
aVIt stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy,
p294
aVwhich is the following:
p295
aVthat in order to seek asylum in Europe,
p296
aVyou have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys
p297
aVthat I described.
p298
aVBut why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline
p299
aVand modern consular capabilities?
p300
aVThey're completely unnecessary journeys,
p301
aVand last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people
p302
aVon Europe's borders and within European territory.
p303
aa(lp304
VIf refugees were simply allowed
p305
aVto travel directly and seek asylum in Europe,
p306
aVwe would avoid that,
p307
aVand there's a way of doing that
p308
aVthrough something called a humanitarian visa,
p309
aVthat allows people to collect a visa at an embassy
p310
aVor a consulate in a neighboring country
p311
aVand then simply pay their own way
p312
aVthrough a ferry or a flight to Europe.
p313
aVIt costs around a thousand euros
p314
aVto take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
p315
aVIt costs 200 euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
p316
aVIf we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advantages.
p317
aVIt would save lives,
p318
aVit would undercut the entire market for smugglers,
p319
aVand it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line
p320
aVin areas like the Greek islands.
p321
aVIt's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd this is an idea that has been applied.
p324
aVBrazil has adopted a pioneering approach
p325
aVwhere over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas,
p326
aVenter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil.
p327
aVAnd in that scheme, every Syrian who has gone through it
p328
aVhas received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee.
p329
aa(lp330
VThere is a historical precedent for it as well.
p331
aVBetween 1922 and 1942,
p332
aVthese Nansen passports were used as travel documents
p333
aVto allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens
p334
aVto travel across Europe
p335
aVand claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
p336
aVAnd the Nansen International Refugee Office
p337
aVreceived the Nobel Peace Prize
p338
aVin recognition of this being a viable strategy.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo all four of these ideas that I've presented you
p341
aVare ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set.
p342
aVThey're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees
p343
aVbeyond those basic, impossible three options
p344
aVI explained to you
p345
aVand still leave others better off.
p346
aa(lp347
VIn conclusion, we really need a new vision,
p348
aVa vision that enlarges the choices of refugees
p349
aVbut recognizes that they don't have to be a burden.
p350
aVThere's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
p351
aVYes, they are a humanitarian responsibility,
p352
aVbut they're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations,
p353
aVwith the ability to make contributions \u2014 if we let them.
p354
aa(lp355
VIn the new world,
p356
aVmigration is not going to go away.
p357
aVWhat we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years.
p358
aVPeople will continue to travel,
p359
aVthey'll continue to be displaced,
p360
aVand we need to find rational, realistic ways of managing this \u2014
p361
aVnot based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance,
p362
aVnot based on logics of charity,
p363
aVbut building on the opportunities
p364
aVoffered by globalization, markets and mobility.
p365
aVI'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians
p366
aVto wake up to this challenge.
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you very much.

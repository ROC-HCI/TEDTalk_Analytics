VSo you go to the doctor and get some tests.
p5
aVThe doctor determines that you have high cholesterol
p6
aVand you would benefit from medication to treat it.
p7
aVSo you get a pillbox.
p8
aVYou have some confidence,
p9
aVyour physician has some confidence that this is going to work.
p10
aVThe company that invented it did a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA.
p11
aVThey studied it very carefully, skeptically, they approved it.
p12
aVThey have a rough idea of how it works,
p13
aVthey have a rough idea of what the side effects are.
p14
aVIt should be OK.
p15
aVYou have a little more of a conversation with your physician
p16
aVand the physician is a little worried because you've been blue,
p17
aVhaven't felt like yourself,
p18
aVyou haven't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do.
p19
aVYour physician says, "You know, I think you have some depression.
p20
aVI'm going to have to give you another pill."
p21
aa(lp22
VSo now we're talking about two medications.
p23
aVThis pill also \u2014 millions of people have taken it,
p24
aVthe company did studies, the FDA looked at it \u2014 all good.
p25
aVThink things should go OK.
p26
aVThink things should go OK.
p27
aVWell, wait a minute.
p28
aVHow much have we studied these two together?
p29
aa(lp30
VWell, it's very hard to do that.
p31
aVIn fact, it's not traditionally done.
p32
aVWe totally depend on what we call "post-marketing surveillance,"
p33
aVafter the drugs hit the market.
p34
aVHow can we figure out if bad things are happening
p35
aVbetween two medications?
p36
aVThree? Five? Seven?
p37
aVAsk your favorite person who has several diagnoses
p38
aVhow many medications they're on.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhy do I care about this problem?
p41
aVI care about it deeply.
p42
aVI'm an informatics and data science guy and really, in my opinion,
p43
aVthe only hope \u2014 only hope \u2014 to understand these interactions
p44
aVis to leverage lots of different sources of data
p45
aVin order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely
p46
aVand when it's not so safe.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo let me tell you a data science story.
p49
aVAnd it begins with my student Nick.
p50
aVLet's call him "Nick," because that's his name.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VNick was a young student.
p55
aVI said, "You know, Nick, we have to understand how drugs work
p56
aVand how they work together and how they work separately,
p57
aVand we don't have a great understanding.
p58
aVBut the FDA has made available an amazing database.
p59
aVIt's a database of adverse events.
p60
aVThey literally put on the web \u2014
p61
aVpublicly available, you could all download it right now \u2014
p62
aVhundreds of thousands of adverse event reports
p63
aVfrom patients, doctors, companies, pharmacists.
p64
aVAnd these reports are pretty simple:
p65
aVit has all the diseases that the patient has,
p66
aVall the drugs that they're on,
p67
aVand all the adverse events, or side effects, that they experience.
p68
aVIt is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today,
p69
aVbut it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo I said to Nick,
p72
aV"Let's think about glucose.
p73
aVGlucose is very important, and we know it's involved with diabetes.
p74
aVLet's see if we can understand glucose response.
p75
aVI sent Nick off. Nick came back.
p76
aa(lp77
V"Russ," he said,
p78
aV"I've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug
p79
aVbased on looking at this database,
p80
aVand can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not."
p81
aa(lp82
VHe did it. It was very simple, in a way.
p83
aVHe took all the drugs that were known to change glucose
p84
aVand a bunch of drugs that don't change glucose,
p85
aVand said, "What's the difference in their side effects?
p86
aVDifferences in fatigue? In appetite? In urination habits?"
p87
aVAll those things conspired to give him a really good predictor.
p88
aVHe said, "Russ, I can predict with 93 percent accuracy
p89
aVwhen a drug will change glucose."
p90
aa(lp91
VI said, "Nick, that's great."
p92
aVHe's a young student, you have to build his confidence.
p93
aV"But Nick, there's a problem.
p94
aVIt's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose,
p95
aVbecause it's core to our practice.
p96
aVSo it's great, good job, but not really that interesting,
p97
aVdefinitely not publishable."
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VHe said, "I know, Russ. I thought you might say that."
p102
aVNick is smart.
p103
aV"I thought you might say that, so I did one other experiment.
p104
aVI looked at people in this database who were on two drugs,
p105
aVand I looked for signals similar, glucose-changing signals,
p106
aVfor people taking two drugs,
p107
aVwhere each drug alone did not change glucose,
p108
aVbut together I saw a strong signal."
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd I said, "Oh! You're clever. Good idea. Show me the list."
p111
aVAnd there's a bunch of drugs, not very exciting.
p112
aVBut what caught my eye was, on the list there were two drugs:
p113
aVparoxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant;
p114
aVand pravastatin, or Pravachol, a cholesterol medication.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd I said, "Huh. There are millions of Americans on those two drugs."
p117
aVIn fact, we learned later,
p118
aV15 million Americans on paroxetine at the time, 15 million on pravastatin,
p119
aVand a million, we estimated, on both.
p120
aVSo that's a million people
p121
aVwho might be having some problems with their glucose
p122
aVif this machine-learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the FDA database
p123
aVactually holds up.
p124
aVBut I said, "It's still not publishable,
p125
aVbecause I love what you did with the mumbo jumbo,
p126
aVwith the machine learning,
p127
aVbut it's not really standard-of-proof evidence that we have."
p128
aVSo we have to do something else.
p129
aVLet's go into the Stanford electronic medical record.
p130
aVWe have a copy of it that's OK for research,
p131
aVwe removed identifying information.
p132
aVAnd I said, "Let's see if people on these two drugs
p133
aVhave problems with their glucose."
p134
aa(lp135
VNow there are thousands and thousands of people
p136
aVin the Stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin.
p137
aVBut we needed special patients.
p138
aVWe needed patients who were on one of them and had a glucose measurement,
p139
aVthen got the second one and had another glucose measurement,
p140
aVall within a reasonable period of time \u2014 something like two months.
p141
aVAnd when we did that, we found 10 patients.
p142
aVHowever, eight out of the 10 had a bump in their glucose
p143
aVwhen they got the second P \u2014 we call this P and P \u2014
p144
aVwhen they got the second P.
p145
aVEither one could be first, the second one comes up,
p146
aVglucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter.
p147
aVJust as a reminder,
p148
aVyou walk around normally, if you're not diabetic,
p149
aVwith a glucose of around 90.
p150
aVAnd if it gets up to 120, 125,
p151
aVyour doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes.
p152
aVSo a 20 bump \u2014 pretty significant.
p153
aa(lp154
VI said, "Nick, this is very cool.
p155
aVBut, I'm sorry, we still don't have a paper,
p156
aVbecause this is 10 patients and \u2014 give me a break \u2014
p157
aVit's not enough patients."
p158
aa(lp159
VSo we said, what can we do?
p160
aVAnd we said, let's call our friends at Harvard and Vanderbilt,
p161
aVwho also \u2014 Harvard in Boston, Vanderbilt in Nashville,
p162
aVwho also have electronic medical records similar to ours.
p163
aVLet's see if they can find similar patients
p164
aVwith the one P, the other P, the glucose measurements
p165
aVin that range that we need.
p166
aa(lp167
VGod bless them, Vanderbilt in one week found 40 such patients,
p168
aVsame trend.
p169
aVHarvard found 100 patients, same trend.
p170
aVSo at the end, we had 150 patients from three diverse medical centers
p171
aVthat were telling us that patients getting these two drugs
p172
aVwere having their glucose bump somewhat significantly.
p173
aa(lp174
VMore interestingly, we had left out diabetics,
p175
aVbecause diabetics already have messed up glucose.
p176
aVWhen we looked at the glucose of diabetics,
p177
aVit was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20.
p178
aVThis was a big deal, and we said, "We've got to publish this."
p179
aVWe submitted the paper.
p180
aVIt was all data evidence,
p181
aVdata from the FDA, data from Stanford,
p182
aVdata from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard.
p183
aVWe had not done a single real experiment.
p184
aa(lp185
VBut we were nervous.
p186
aVSo Nick, while the paper was in review, went to the lab.
p187
aVWe found somebody who knew about lab stuff.
p188
aVI don't do that.
p189
aVI take care of patients, but I don't do pipettes.
p190
aVThey taught us how to feed mice drugs.
p191
aVWe took mice and we gave them one P, paroxetine.
p192
aVWe gave some other mice pravastatin.
p193
aVAnd we gave a third group of mice both of them.
p194
aVAnd lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter
p195
aVin the mice.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone,
p198
aVbut we added a little note at the end,
p199
aVsaying, oh by the way, if you give these to mice, it goes up.
p200
aa(lp201
VThat was great, and the story could have ended there.
p202
aVBut I still have six and a half minutes.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VSo we were sitting around thinking about all of this,
p207
aVand I don't remember who thought of it, but somebody said,
p208
aV"I wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs
p209
aVare noticing side effects of hyperglycemia.
p210
aVThey could and they should.
p211
aVHow would we ever determine that?"
p212
aa(lp213
VWe said, well, what do you do?
p214
aVYou're taking a medication, one new medication or two,
p215
aVand you get a funny feeling.
p216
aVWhat do you do?
p217
aVYou go to Google
p218
aVand type in the two drugs you're taking or the one drug you're taking,
p219
aVand you type in "side effects."
p220
aVWhat are you experiencing?
p221
aVSo we said OK,
p222
aVlet's ask Google if they will share their search logs with us,
p223
aVso that we can look at the search logs
p224
aVand see if patients are doing these kinds of searches.
p225
aVGoogle, I am sorry to say, denied our request.
p226
aVSo I was bummed.
p227
aVI was at a dinner with a colleague who works at Microsoft Research
p228
aVand I said, "We wanted to do this study,
p229
aVGoogle said no, it's kind of a bummer."
p230
aVHe said, "Well, we have the Bing searches."
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VYeah.
p235
aVThat's great.
p236
aVNow I felt like I was \u2014
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VI felt like I was talking to Nick again.
p241
aVHe works for one of the largest companies in the world,
p242
aVand I'm already trying to make him feel better.
p243
aVBut he said, "No, Russ \u2014 you might not understand.
p244
aVWe not only have Bing searches,
p245
aVbut if you use Internet Explorer to do searches at Google,
p246
aVYahoo, Bing, any ...
p247
aVThen, for 18 months, we keep that data for research purposes only."
p248
aVI said, "Now you're talking!"
p249
aVThis was Eric Horvitz, my friend at Microsoft.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo we did a study
p252
aVwhere we defined 50 words that a regular person might type in
p253
aVif they're having hyperglycemia,
p254
aVlike "fatigue," "loss of appetite," "urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" \u2014
p255
aVforgive me, but that's one of the things you might type in.
p256
aVSo we had 50 phrases that we called the "diabetes words."
p257
aVAnd we did first a baseline.
p258
aVAnd it turns out that about .5 to one percent
p259
aVof all searches on the Internet involve one of those words.
p260
aVSo that's our baseline rate.
p261
aVIf people type in "paroxetine" or "Paxil" \u2014 those are synonyms \u2014
p262
aVand one of those words,
p263
aVthe rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words,
p264
aVif you already know that there's that "paroxetine" word.
p265
aVIf it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline.
p266
aVIf both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin" are present in the query,
p267
aVit goes up to 10 percent,
p268
aVa huge three- to four-fold increase
p269
aVin those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in,
p270
aVand diabetes-type words or hyperglycemia-type words.
p271
aa(lp272
VWe published this,
p273
aVand it got some attention.
p274
aVThe reason it deserves attention
p275
aVis that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly
p276
aVthrough their searches.
p277
aVWe brought this to the attention of the FDA.
p278
aVThey were interested.
p279
aVThey have set up social media surveillance programs
p280
aVto collaborate with Microsoft,
p281
aVwhich had a nice infrastructure for doing this, and others,
p282
aVto look at Twitter feeds,
p283
aVto look at Facebook feeds,
p284
aVto look at search logs,
p285
aVto try to see early signs that drugs, either individually or together,
p286
aVare causing problems.
p287
aa(lp288
VWhat do I take from this? Why tell this story?
p289
aVWell, first of all,
p290
aVwe have now the promise of big data and medium-sized data
p291
aVto help us understand drug interactions
p292
aVand really, fundamentally, drug actions.
p293
aVHow do drugs work?
p294
aVThis will create and has created a new ecosystem
p295
aVfor understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use.
p296
aVNick went on; he's a professor at Columbia now.
p297
aVHe did this in his PhD for hundreds of pairs of drugs.
p298
aVHe found several very important interactions,
p299
aVand so we replicated this
p300
aVand we showed that this is a way that really works
p301
aVfor finding drug-drug interactions.
p302
aa(lp303
VHowever, there's a couple of things.
p304
aVWe don't just use pairs of drugs at a time.
p305
aVAs I said before, there are patients on three, five, seven, nine drugs.
p306
aVHave they been studied with respect to their nine-way interaction?
p307
aVYes, we can do pair-wise, A and B, A and C, A and D,
p308
aVbut what about A, B, C, D, E, F, G all together,
p309
aVbeing taken by the same patient,
p310
aVperhaps interacting with each other
p311
aVin ways that either makes them more effective or less effective
p312
aVor causes side effects that are unexpected?
p313
aVWe really have no idea.
p314
aVIt's a blue sky, open field for us to use data
p315
aVto try to understand the interaction of drugs.
p316
aa(lp317
VTwo more lessons:
p318
aVI want you to think about the power that we were able to generate
p319
aVwith the data from people who had volunteered their adverse reactions
p320
aVthrough their pharmacists, through themselves, through their doctors,
p321
aVthe people who allowed the databases at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt,
p322
aVto be used for research.
p323
aVPeople are worried about data.
p324
aVThey're worried about their privacy and security \u2014 they should be.
p325
aVWe need secure systems.
p326
aVBut we can't have a system that closes that data off,
p327
aVbecause it is too rich of a source
p328
aVof inspiration, innovation and discovery
p329
aVfor new things in medicine.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd the final thing I want to say is,
p332
aVin this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sad story.
p333
aVThe two drugs actually caused problems.
p334
aVThey increased glucose.
p335
aVThey could throw somebody into diabetes
p336
aVwho would otherwise not be in diabetes,
p337
aVand so you would want to use the two drugs very carefully together,
p338
aVperhaps not together,
p339
aVmake different choices when you're prescribing.
p340
aVBut there was another possibility.
p341
aVWe could have found two drugs or three drugs
p342
aVthat were interacting in a beneficial way.
p343
aVWe could have found new effects of drugs
p344
aVthat neither of them has alone,
p345
aVbut together, instead of causing a side effect,
p346
aVthey could be a new and novel treatment
p347
aVfor diseases that don't have treatments
p348
aVor where the treatments are not effective.
p349
aVIf we think about drug treatment today,
p350
aVall the major breakthroughs \u2014
p351
aVfor HIV, for tuberculosis, for depression, for diabetes \u2014
p352
aVit's always a cocktail of drugs.
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd so the upside here,
p355
aVand the subject for a different TED Talk on a different day,
p356
aVis how can we use the same data sources
p357
aVto find good effects of drugs in combination
p358
aVthat will provide us new treatments,
p359
aVnew insights into how drugs work
p360
aVand enable us to take care of our patients even better?
p361
aa(lp362
VThank you very much.

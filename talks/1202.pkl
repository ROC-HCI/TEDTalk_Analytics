VDo you know
p5
aVthat we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts
p6
aVdeployed worldwide?
p7
aVAnd these are base stations.
p8
aVAnd we also have
p9
aVmore than five billion
p10
aVof these devices here.
p11
aVThese are cellular mobile phones.
p12
aVAnd with these mobile phones,
p13
aVwe transmit more than 600 terabytes of data
p14
aVevery month.
p15
aVThis is a 6 with 14 zeroes \u2014
p16
aVa very large number.
p17
aVAnd wireless communications
p18
aVhas become a utility
p19
aVlike electricity and water.
p20
aVWe use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now \u2014
p21
aVin our private lives, in our business lives.
p22
aVAnd we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly,
p23
aVto switch off the mobile phone at events like this
p24
aVfor good reasons.
p25
aVAnd it's this importance
p26
aVwhy I decided to look into the issues
p27
aVthat this technology has,
p28
aVbecause it's so fundamental to our lives.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd one of the issues is capacity.
p31
aVThe way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves \u2014
p32
aVin particular, radio waves.
p33
aVAnd radio waves are limited.
p34
aVThey are scarce; they are expensive;
p35
aVand we only have a certain range of it.
p36
aVAnd it's this limitation
p37
aVthat doesn't cope
p38
aVwith the demand of wireless data transmissions
p39
aVand the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month.
p40
aVAnd we are simply running out of spectrum.
p41
aVThere's another problem.
p42
aVThat is efficiency.
p43
aVThese 1.4 million cellular radio masts, or base stations,
p44
aVconsume a lot of energy.
p45
aVAnd mind you, most of the energy
p46
aVis not used to transmit the radio waves,
p47
aVit is used to cool the base stations.
p48
aVThen the efficiency of such a base station
p49
aVis only at about five percent.
p50
aVAnd that creates a big problem.
p51
aVThen there's another issue that you're all aware of.
p52
aVYou have to switch off your mobile phone
p53
aVduring flights.
p54
aVIn hospitals, they are security issues.
p55
aVAnd security is another issue.
p56
aVThese radio waves penetrate through walls.
p57
aVThey can be intercepted,
p58
aVand somebody can make use of your network
p59
aVif he has bad intentions.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo these are the main four issues.
p62
aVBut on the other hand,
p63
aVwe have 14 billion of these:
p64
aVlight bulbs, light.
p65
aVAnd light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
p66
aVSo let's look at this in the context
p67
aVof the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays.
p68
aVYou don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous.
p69
aVX-rays, useful when you go to hospitals.
p70
aVThen there's ultraviolet light.
p71
aVit's good for a nice suntan,
p72
aVbut otherwise dangerous for the human body.
p73
aVInfrared \u2014
p74
aVdue to eye safety regulations,
p75
aVcan be only used with low power.
p76
aVAnd then we have the radio waves, they have the issues I've just mentioned.
p77
aVAnd in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.
p78
aVIt's light,
p79
aVand light has been around for many millions of years.
p80
aVAnd in fact, it has created us,
p81
aVhas created life,
p82
aVhas created all the stuff of life.
p83
aVSo it's inherently safe to use.
p84
aVAnd wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications?
p85
aa(lp86
VNot only that, I compared [it to] the entire spectrum.
p87
aVI compared the radio waves spectrum \u2014
p88
aVthe size of it \u2014
p89
aVwith the size of the visible light spectrum.
p90
aVAnd guess what?
p91
aVWe have 10,000 times more of that spectrum,
p92
aVwhich is there for us to use.
p93
aVSo not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum,
p94
aVlet's compare that with a number I've just mentioned.
p95
aVWe have 1.4 million
p96
aVexpensively deployed,
p97
aVinefficient radio cellular base stations.
p98
aVAnd multiply that by 10,000,
p99
aVthen you end up at 14 billion.
p100
aV14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already.
p101
aVSo we have the infrastructure there.
p102
aVLook at the ceiling, you see all these light bulbs.
p103
aVGo to the main floor, you see these light bulbs.
p104
aa(lp105
VCan we use them for communications?
p106
aVYes.
p107
aVWhat do we need to do?
p108
aVThe one thing we need to do
p109
aVis we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs,
p110
aVflorescent lights,
p111
aVwith this new technology of LED,
p112
aVLED light bulbs.
p113
aVAn LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device.
p114
aVAnd it has a very nice acute property.
p115
aVIts intensity can be modulated
p116
aVat very high speeds,
p117
aVand it can be switched off at very high speeds.
p118
aVAnd this is a fundamental basic property
p119
aVthat we exploit
p120
aVwith our technology.
p121
aVSo let's show how we do that.
p122
aVLet's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum \u2014
p123
aVgo to remote controls.
p124
aVYou all know remote controls have an infrared LED \u2014
p125
aVbasically you switch on the LED, and if it's off, you switch it off.
p126
aVAnd it creates a simple, low-speed data stream
p127
aVin 10,000 bits per second,
p128
aV20,000 bits per second.
p129
aVNot usable for a YouTube video.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhat we have done
p132
aVis we have developed a technology
p133
aVwith which we can furthermore
p134
aVreplace the remote control of our light bulb.
p135
aVWe transmit with our technology,
p136
aVnot only a single data stream,
p137
aVwe transmit thousands of data streams
p138
aVin parallel,
p139
aVat even higher speeds.
p140
aVAnd the technology we have developed \u2014
p141
aVit's called SIM OFDM.
p142
aVAnd it's spacial modulation \u2014
p143
aVthese are the only technical terms, I'm not going into details \u2014
p144
aVbut this is how we enabled
p145
aVthat light source
p146
aVto transmit data.
p147
aa(lp148
VYou will say, "Okay, this is nice \u2014
p149
aVa slide created in 10 minutes."
p150
aVBut not only that.
p151
aVWhat we've done
p152
aVis we have also developed a demonstrator.
p153
aVAnd I'm showing for the first time in public
p154
aVthis visible light demonstrator.
p155
aVAnd what we have here
p156
aVis no ordinary desk lamp.
p157
aVWe fit in an LED light bulb,
p158
aVworth three U.S. dollars,
p159
aVput in our signal processing technology.
p160
aVAnd then what we have here is a little hole.
p161
aVAnd the light goes through that hole.
p162
aVThere's a receiver.
p163
aVThe receiver will convert these little, subtle changes in the amplitude
p164
aVthat we create there
p165
aVinto an electrical signal.
p166
aVAnd that signal is then converted back
p167
aVto a high-speed data stream.
p168
aVIn the future we hope
p169
aVthat we can integrate this little hole
p170
aVinto these smart phones.
p171
aVAnd not only integrate a photo detector here,
p172
aVbut maybe use the camera inside.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo what happens
p175
aVwhen I switch on that light?
p176
aVAs you would expect,
p177
aVit's a light, a desk lamp.
p178
aVPut your book beneath it and you can read.
p179
aVIt's illuminating the space.
p180
aVBut at the same time, you see this video coming up here.
p181
aVAnd that's a video, a high-definition video
p182
aVthat is transmitted through that light beam.
p183
aVYou're critical.
p184
aVYou think, "Ha, ha, ha.
p185
aVThis is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here."
p186
aVBut let me do this.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Applause)
p189
aa(lp190
VOnce again.
p191
aVStill don't believe?
p192
aVIt is this light
p193
aVthat transmits this high-definition video in a split stream.
p194
aVAnd if you look at the light,
p195
aVit is illuminating as you would expect.
p196
aVYou don't notice with your human eye.
p197
aVYou don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude
p198
aVthat we impress onto this light bulb.
p199
aVIt's serving the purpose of illumination,
p200
aVbut at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.
p201
aVAnd you see,
p202
aVeven light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.
p203
aVIt can ignore that constant light,
p204
aVbecause all the receiver's interested in
p205
aVare subtle changes.
p206
aVYou also have a critical question now, and
p207
aVyou say, "Okay,
p208
aVdo I have to have the light on all the time
p209
aVto have this working?"
p210
aVAnd the answer is yes.
p211
aVBut, you can dim down the light
p212
aVto a level that it appears to be off.
p213
aVAnd you are still able to transmit data \u2014 that's possible.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo I've mentioned to you the four challenges.
p216
aVCapacity:
p217
aVWe have 10,000 times more spectrum,
p218
aV10,000 times more LEDs
p219
aVinstalled already in the infrastructure there.
p220
aVYou would agree with me, hopefully,
p221
aVthere's no issue of capacity anymore.
p222
aVEfficiency:
p223
aVThis is data through illumination \u2014
p224
aVit's first of all an illumination device.
p225
aVAnd if you do the energy budget,
p226
aVthe data transmission comes for free \u2014
p227
aVhighly energy efficient.
p228
aVI don't mention the high energy efficiency
p229
aVof these LED light bulbs.
p230
aVIf the whole world would deploy them,
p231
aVyou would save hundreds of power plants.
p232
aVThat's aside.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd then I've mentioned the availability.
p235
aVYou will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital.
p236
aVYou need to see what to do.
p237
aVYou have lights in an aircraft.
p238
aVSo it's everywhere in a day there is light.
p239
aVLook around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone.
p240
aVIt has a flashlight, an LED flashlight.
p241
aVThese are potential sources for high-speed data transmission.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd then there's security.
p244
aVYou would agree with me
p245
aVthat light doesn't penetrate through walls.
p246
aVSo no one, if I have a light here,
p247
aVif I have secure data,
p248
aVno one on the other side of this room through that wall
p249
aVwould be able to read that data.
p250
aVAnd there's only data where there is light.
p251
aVSo if I don't want that receiver to receive the data,
p252
aVthen what I could do,
p253
aVturn it away.
p254
aVSo the data goes in that direction, not there anymore.
p255
aVNow we can in fact see where the data is going to.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo for me,
p258
aVthe applications of it,
p259
aVto me, are beyond imagination at the moment.
p260
aVWe have had a century of very nice, smart application developers.
p261
aVAnd you only have to notice, where we have light,
p262
aVthere is a potential way to transmit data.
p263
aVBut I can give you a few examples.
p264
aVWell you may see the impact already now.
p265
aVThis is a remote operated vehicle
p266
aVbeneath the ocean.
p267
aVAnd they use light to illuminate space down there.
p268
aVAnd this light can be used to transmit wireless data
p269
aVthat these things [use] to communicate with each other.
p270
aa(lp271
VIntrinsically safe environments
p272
aVlike this petrochemical plant \u2014
p273
aVyou can't use RF, it may generate antenna sparks,
p274
aVbut you can use light \u2014 you see plenty of light there.
p275
aVIn hospitals,
p276
aVfor new medical instruments;
p277
aVin streets for traffic control.
p278
aVCars have LED-based headlights, LED-based back lights,
p279
aVand cars can communicate with each other
p280
aVand prevent accidents
p281
aVin the way that they exchange information.
p282
aVTraffic lights can communicate to the car and so on.
p283
aVAnd then you have these millions of street lamps
p284
aVdeployed around the world.
p285
aVAnd every street lamp could be a free access point.
p286
aVWe call it, in fact, a Li-Fi,
p287
aVlight-fidelity.
p288
aVAnd then we have these aircraft cabins.
p289
aVThere are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin,
p290
aVand each of these lights
p291
aVcould be a potential transmitter of wireless data.
p292
aVSo you could enjoy your most favorite TED video
p293
aVon your long flight back home.
p294
aVOnline life. So that is a vision, I think, that is possible.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo, all we would need to do
p297
aVis to fit a small microchip
p298
aVto every potential illumination device.
p299
aVAnd this would then combine
p300
aVtwo basic functionalities:
p301
aVillumination and wireless data transmission.
p302
aVAnd it's this symbiosis that I personally believe
p303
aVcould solve the four essential problems
p304
aVthat face us in wireless communication these days.
p305
aVAnd in the future,
p306
aVyou would not only have 14 billion light bulbs,
p307
aVyou may have 14 billion Li-Fis
p308
aVdeployed worldwide \u2014
p309
aVfor a cleaner, a greener,
p310
aVand even a brighter future.
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you.

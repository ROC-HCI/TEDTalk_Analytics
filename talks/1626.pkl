VI'd like to show you a video of some of the models
p5
aVI work with.
p6
aVThey're all the perfect size, and they don't have an ounce of fat.
p7
aVDid I mention they're gorgeous?
p8
aVAnd they're scientific models? (Laughs)
p9
aa(lp10
VAs you might have guessed, I'm a tissue engineer,
p11
aVand this is a video of some of the beating heart
p12
aVthat I've engineered in the lab.
p13
aVAnd one day we hope that these tissues
p14
aVcan serve as replacement parts for the human body.
p15
aVBut what I'm going to tell you about today
p16
aVis how these tissues make awesome models.
p17
aa(lp18
VWell, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment.
p19
aVYou go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing,
p20
aVand then clinical trials, which you might call human testing,
p21
aVbefore the drugs get to market.
p22
aVIt costs a lot of money, a lot of time,
p23
aVand sometimes, even when a drug hits the market,
p24
aVit acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.
p25
aVAnd the later it fails, the worse the consequences.
p26
aa(lp27
VIt all boils down to two issues. One, humans are not rats,
p28
aVand two, despite our incredible similarities to one another,
p29
aVactually those tiny differences between you and I
p30
aVhave huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs
p31
aVand how those drugs affect us.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo what if we had better models in the lab
p34
aVthat could not only mimic us better than rats
p35
aVbut also reflect our diversity?
p36
aVLet's see how we can do it with tissue engineering.
p37
aa(lp38
VOne of the key technologies that's really important
p39
aVis what's called induced pluripotent stem cells.
p40
aVThey were developed in Japan pretty recently.
p41
aVOkay, induced pluripotent stem cells.
p42
aVThey're a lot like embryonic stem cells
p43
aVexcept without the controversy.
p44
aVWe induce cells, okay, say, skin cells,
p45
aVby adding a few genes to them, culturing them,
p46
aVand then harvesting them.
p47
aVSo they're skin cells that can be tricked,
p48
aVkind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state.
p49
aVSo without the controversy, that's cool thing number one.
p50
aVCool thing number two, you can grow any type of tissue
p51
aVout of them: brain, heart, liver, you get the picture,
p52
aVbut out of your cells.
p53
aVSo we can make a model of your heart, your brain
p54
aVon a chip.
p55
aa(lp56
VGenerating tissues of predictable density and behavior
p57
aVis the second piece, and will be really key towards
p58
aVgetting these models to be adopted for drug discovery.
p59
aVAnd this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab
p60
aVto help engineer tissues in a more modular, scalable way.
p61
aVGoing forward, imagine a massively parallel version of this
p62
aVwith thousands of pieces of human tissue.
p63
aVIt would be like having a clinical trial on a chip.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells
p66
aVis that if we take some skin cells, let's say,
p67
aVfrom people with a genetic disease
p68
aVand we engineer tissues out of them,
p69
aVwe can actually use tissue-engineering techniques
p70
aVto generate models of those diseases in the lab.
p71
aVHere's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard.
p72
aVHe generated neurons
p73
aVfrom these induced pluripotent stem cells
p74
aVfrom patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease,
p75
aVand he differentiated them into neurons, and what's amazing
p76
aVis that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease.
p77
aVSo with disease models like these, we can fight back
p78
aVfaster than ever before and understand the disease better
p79
aVthan ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster.
p80
aVThis is another example of patient-specific stem cells
p81
aVthat were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa.
p82
aVThis is a degeneration of the retina.
p83
aVIt's a disease that runs in my family, and we really hope
p84
aVthat cells like these will help us find a cure.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo some people think that these models sound well and good,
p87
aVbut ask, "Well, are these really as good as the rat?"
p88
aVThe rat is an entire organism, after all,
p89
aVwith interacting networks of organs.
p90
aVA drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver,
p91
aVand some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat.
p92
aVDon't you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models?
p93
aVWell, this is another trend in the field.
p94
aVBy combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics,
p95
aVthe field is actually evolving towards just that,
p96
aVa model of the entire ecosystem of the body,
p97
aVcomplete with multiple organ systems to be able to test
p98
aVhow a drug you might take for your blood pressure
p99
aVmight affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart.
p100
aVThese systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there,
p101
aVand so, watch out.
p102
aa(lp103
VBut that's not even all of it, because once a drug is approved,
p104
aVtissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments.
p105
aVThis is an example that you might care about someday,
p106
aVand I hope you never do,
p107
aVbecause imagine if you ever get that call
p108
aVthat gives you that bad news that you might have cancer.
p109
aVWouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs
p110
aVyou're going to take are going to work on your cancer?
p111
aVThis is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're
p112
aVusing inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells
p113
aVand study its progressions and treatments.
p114
aVAnd some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models
p115
aVlike these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer
p116
aVmight spread from one part of the body to the next,
p117
aVand you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips
p118
aVto be the next generation of these kinds of studies.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd so thinking about the models that we've just discussed,
p121
aVyou can see, going forward, that tissue engineering
p122
aVis actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening
p123
aVat every single step of the path:
p124
aVdisease models making for better drug formulations,
p125
aVmassively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing,
p126
aVreduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials,
p127
aVand individualized therapies that disrupt
p128
aVwhat we even consider to be a market at all.
p129
aVEssentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback
p130
aVbetween developing a molecule and learning about
p131
aVhow it acts in the human body.
p132
aVOur process for doing this is essentially transforming
p133
aVbiotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology,
p134
aVhelping us discover and evaluate drugs faster,
p135
aVmore cheaply and more effectively.
p136
aVIt gives new meaning to models against animal testing, doesn't it?
p137
aVThank you. (Applause)

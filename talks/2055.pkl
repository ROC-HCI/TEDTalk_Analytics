VYou probably don't know me,
p5
aVbut I am one of those .01 percenters
p6
aVthat you hear about and read about,
p7
aVand I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat.
p8
aVAnd tonight, what I would like to do is speak directly
p9
aVto other plutocrats, to my people,
p10
aVbecause it feels like it's time for us all
p11
aVto have a chat.
p12
aVLike most plutocrats, I too am a proud
p13
aVand unapologetic capitalist.
p14
aVI have founded, cofounded or funded
p15
aVover 30 companies across a range of industries.
p16
aVI was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com.
p17
aVI cofounded a company called aQuantive
p18
aVthat we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars.
p19
aVMy friends and I, we own a bank.
p20
aVI tell you this \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p21
aVunbelievable, right?
p22
aa(lp23
VI tell you this to show
p24
aVthat my life is like most plutocrats.
p25
aVI have a broad perspective on capitalism
p26
aVand business,
p27
aVand I have been rewarded obscenely for that
p28
aVwith a life that most of you all
p29
aVcan't even imagine:
p30
aVmultiple homes, a yacht, my own plane,
p31
aVetc., etc., etc.
p32
aVBut let's be honest: I am not the smartest person you've ever met.
p33
aVI am certainly not the hardest working.
p34
aVI was a mediocre student.
p35
aVI'm not technical at all.
p36
aVI can't write a word of code.
p37
aVTruly, my success is the consequence
p38
aVof spectacular luck,
p39
aVof birth, of circumstance and of timing.
p40
aVBut I am actually pretty good at a couple of things.
p41
aVOne, I have an unusually high tolerance for risk,
p42
aVand the other is I have a good sense,
p43
aVa good intuition about what will happen in the future,
p44
aVand I think that that intuition about the future
p45
aVis the essence of good entrepreneurship.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo what do I see in our future today,
p48
aVyou ask?
p49
aVI see pitchforks,
p50
aVas in angry mobs with pitchforks,
p51
aVbecause while people like us plutocrats
p52
aVare living beyond the dreams of avarice,
p53
aVthe other 99 percent of our fellow citizens
p54
aVare falling farther and farther behind.
p55
aVIn 1980, the top one percent of Americans
p56
aVshared about eight percent of national [income],
p57
aVwhile the bottom 50 percent of Americans
p58
aVshared 18 percent.
p59
aVThirty years later, today, the top one percent
p60
aVshares over 20 percent of national [income],
p61
aVwhile the bottom 50 percent of Americans
p62
aVshare 12 or 13.
p63
aVIf the trend continues,
p64
aVthe top one percent will share
p65
aVover 30 percent of national [income]
p66
aVin another 30 years,
p67
aVwhile the bottom 50 percent of Americans
p68
aVwill share just six.
p69
aa(lp70
VYou see, the problem isn't that we have
p71
aVsome inequality.
p72
aVSome inequality is necessary
p73
aVfor a high-functioning capitalist democracy.
p74
aVThe problem is that inequality
p75
aVis at historic highs today
p76
aVand it's getting worse every day.
p77
aVAnd if wealth, power, and income
p78
aVcontinue to concentrate
p79
aVat the very tippy top,
p80
aVour society will change
p81
aVfrom a capitalist democracy
p82
aVto a neo-feudalist rentier society
p83
aVlike 18th-century France.
p84
aVThat was France
p85
aVbefore the revolution
p86
aVand the mobs with the pitchforks.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo I have a message for my fellow plutocrats
p89
aVand zillionaires
p90
aVand for anyone who lives
p91
aVin a gated bubble world:
p92
aVWake up.
p93
aVWake up. It cannot last.
p94
aVBecause if we do not do something
p95
aVto fix the glaring economic inequities in our society,
p96
aVthe pitchforks will come for us,
p97
aVfor no free and open society can long sustain
p98
aVthis kind of rising economic inequality.
p99
aVIt has never happened. There are no examples.
p100
aVYou show me a highly unequal society,
p101
aVand I will show you a police state
p102
aVor an uprising.
p103
aVThe pitchforks will come for us
p104
aVif we do not address this.
p105
aVIt's not a matter of if, it's when.
p106
aVAnd it will be terrible when they come
p107
aVfor everyone,
p108
aVbut particularly for people like us plutocrats.
p109
aa(lp110
VI know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder.
p111
aVI'm not. I'm not making a moral argument
p112
aVthat economic inequality is wrong.
p113
aVWhat I am arguing is that rising economic inequality
p114
aVis stupid and ultimately self-defeating.
p115
aVRising inequality doesn't just increase our risks
p116
aVfrom pitchforks,
p117
aVbut it's also terrible for business too.
p118
aVSo the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford.
p119
aVWhen Ford famously introduced the $5 day,
p120
aVwhich was twice the prevailing wage at the time,
p121
aVhe didn't just increase the productivity
p122
aVof his factories,
p123
aVhe converted exploited autoworkers who were poor
p124
aVinto a thriving middle class who could now afford
p125
aVto buy the products that they made.
p126
aVFord intuited what we now know is true,
p127
aVthat an economy is best understood as an ecosystem
p128
aVand characterized by the same kinds
p129
aVof feedback loops you find
p130
aVin a natural ecosystem,
p131
aVa feedback loop between customers and businesses.
p132
aVRaising wages increases demand,
p133
aVwhich increases hiring,
p134
aVwhich in turn increases wages
p135
aVand demand and profits,
p136
aVand that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity
p137
aVis precisely what is missing
p138
aVfrom today's economic recovery.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd this is why we need to put behind us
p141
aVthe trickle-down policies that so dominate
p142
aVboth political parties
p143
aVand embrace something I call middle-out economics.
p144
aVMiddle-out economics rejects
p145
aVthe neoclassical economic idea
p146
aVthat economies are efficient, linear, mechanistic,
p147
aVthat they tend towards equilibrium and fairness,
p148
aVand instead embraces the 21st-century idea
p149
aVthat economies are complex, adaptive,
p150
aVecosystemic,
p151
aVthat they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality,
p152
aVthat they're not efficient at all
p153
aVbut are effective if well managed.
p154
aVThis 21st-century perspective
p155
aVallows you to clearly see that capitalism
p156
aVdoes not work by [efficiently] allocating
p157
aVexisting resources.
p158
aVIt works by [efficiently] creating new solutions
p159
aVto human problems.
p160
aVThe genius of capitalism
p161
aVis that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system.
p162
aVIt rewards people for solving other people's problems.
p163
aVThe difference between a poor society
p164
aVand a rich society, obviously,
p165
aVis the degree to which that society
p166
aVhas generated solutions in the form
p167
aVof products for its citizens.
p168
aVThe sum of the solutions
p169
aVthat we have in our society
p170
aVreally is our prosperity, and this explains
p171
aVwhy companies like Google and Amazon
p172
aVand Microsoft and Apple
p173
aVand the entrepreneurs who created those companies
p174
aVhave contributed so much
p175
aVto our nation's prosperity.
p176
aa(lp177
VThis 21st-century perspective
p178
aValso makes clear
p179
aVthat what we think of as economic growth
p180
aVis best understood as
p181
aVthe rate at which we solve problems.
p182
aVBut that rate is totally dependent upon
p183
aVhow many problem solvers \u2014
p184
aVdiverse, able problem solvers \u2014 we have,
p185
aVand thus how many of our fellow citizens
p186
aVactively participate,
p187
aVboth as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions,
p188
aVand as customers who consume them.
p189
aVBut this maximizing participation thing
p190
aVdoesn't happen by accident.
p191
aVIt doesn't happen by itself.
p192
aVIt requires effort and investment,
p193
aVwhich is why all
p194
aVhighly prosperous capitalist democracies
p195
aVare characterized by massive investments
p196
aVin the middle class and the infrastructure
p197
aVthat they depend on.
p198
aa(lp199
VWe plutocrats need to get this
p200
aVtrickle-down economics thing behind us,
p201
aVthis idea that the better we do,
p202
aVthe better everyone else will do.
p203
aVIt's not true. How could it be?
p204
aVI earn 1,000 times the median wage,
p205
aVbut I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff,
p206
aVdo I?
p207
aVI actually bought two pairs of these pants,
p208
aVwhat my partner Mike calls
p209
aVmy manager pants.
p210
aVI could have bought 2,000 pairs,
p211
aVbut what would I do with them? (Laughter)
p212
aVHow many haircuts can I get?
p213
aVHow often can I go out to dinner?
p214
aVNo matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get,
p215
aVwe can never drive a great national economy.
p216
aVOnly a thriving middle class can do that.
p217
aVThere's nothing to be done,
p218
aVmy plutocrat friends might say.
p219
aVHenry Ford was in a different time.
p220
aVMaybe we can't do some things.
p221
aVMaybe we can do some things.
p222
aVJune 19, 2013,
p223
aVBloomberg published an article I wrote called
p224
aV"The Capitalist\u2019s Case for a $15 Minimum Wage."
p225
aVThe good people at Forbes magazine,
p226
aVamong my biggest admirers,
p227
aVcalled it "Nick Hanauer's near-insane proposal."
p228
aVAnd yet, just 350 days
p229
aVafter that article was published,
p230
aVSeattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law
p231
aVan ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle
p232
aVto 15 dollars an hour,
p233
aVmore than double
p234
aVwhat the prevailing federal $7.25 rate is.
p235
aVHow did this happen,
p236
aVreasonable people might ask.
p237
aVIt happened because a group of us
p238
aVreminded the middle class
p239
aVthat they are the source
p240
aVof growth and prosperity in capitalist economies.
p241
aVWe reminded them that when workers have more money,
p242
aVbusinesses have more customers,
p243
aVand need more employees.
p244
aVWe reminded them that when businesses
p245
aVpay workers a living wage,
p246
aVtaxpayers are relieved of the burden
p247
aVof funding the poverty programs
p248
aVlike food stamps and medical assistance
p249
aVand rent assistance
p250
aVthat those workers need.
p251
aVWe reminded them that low-wage workers
p252
aVmake terrible taxpayers,
p253
aVand that when you raise the minimum wage
p254
aVfor all businesses,
p255
aVall businesses benefit
p256
aVyet all can compete.
p257
aa(lp258
VNow the orthodox reaction, of course,
p259
aVis raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right?
p260
aVYour politician's always echoing
p261
aVthat trickle-down idea by saying things like,
p262
aV"Well, if you raise the price of employment,
p263
aVguess what happens? You get less of it."
p264
aa(lp265
VAre you sure?
p266
aVBecause there's some contravening evidence.
p267
aVSince 1980, the wages of CEOs in our country
p268
aVhave gone from about 30 times the median wage
p269
aVto 500 times.
p270
aVThat's raising the price of employment.
p271
aVAnd yet, to my knowledge,
p272
aVI have never seen a company
p273
aVoutsource its CEO's job, automate their job,
p274
aVexport the job to China.
p275
aVIn fact, we appear to be employing
p276
aVmore CEOs and senior managers than ever before.
p277
aVSo too for technology workers
p278
aVand financial services workers,
p279
aVwho earn multiples of the median wage
p280
aVand yet we employ more and more of them,
p281
aVso clearly you can raise the price of employment
p282
aVand get more of it.
p283
aa(lp284
VI know that most people
p285
aVthink that the $15 minimum wage
p286
aVis this insane, risky economic experiment.
p287
aVWe disagree.
p288
aVWe believe that the $15 minimum wage
p289
aVin Seattle
p290
aVis actually the continuation
p291
aVof a logical economic policy.
p292
aVIt is allowing our city
p293
aVto kick your city's ass.
p294
aVBecause, you see,
p295
aVWashington state already has
p296
aVthe highest minimum wage
p297
aVof any state in the nation.
p298
aVWe pay all workers $9.32,
p299
aVwhich is almost 30 percent more
p300
aVthan the federal minimum of 7.25,
p301
aVbut crucially, 427 percent more
p302
aVthan the federal tipped minimum of 2.13.
p303
aVIf trickle-down thinkers were right,
p304
aVthen Washington state should have massive unemployment.
p305
aVSeattle should be sliding into the ocean.
p306
aVAnd yet, Seattle
p307
aVis the fastest-growing big city in the country.
p308
aVWashington state is generating small business jobs
p309
aVat a higher rate than any other major state
p310
aVin the nation.
p311
aVThe restaurant business in Seattle? Booming.
p312
aVWhy? Because the fundamental law of capitalism is,
p313
aVwhen workers have more money,
p314
aVbusinesses have more customers
p315
aVand need more workers.
p316
aVWhen restaurants pay restaurant workers enough
p317
aVso that even they can afford to eat in restaurants,
p318
aVthat's not bad for the restaurant business.
p319
aVThat's good for it,
p320
aVdespite what some restaurateurs may tell you.
p321
aa(lp322
VIs it more complicated than I'm making out?
p323
aVOf course it is.
p324
aVThere are a lot of dynamics at play.
p325
aVBut can we please stop insisting
p326
aVthat if low-wage workers earn a little bit more,
p327
aVunemployment will skyrocket
p328
aVand the economy will collapse?
p329
aVThere is no evidence for it.
p330
aVThe most insidious thing
p331
aVabout trickle-down economics
p332
aVis not the claim that if the rich get richer,
p333
aVeveryone is better off.
p334
aVIt is the claim made by those who oppose
p335
aVany increase in the minimum wage
p336
aVthat if the poor get richer,
p337
aVthat will be bad for the economy.
p338
aVThis is nonsense.
p339
aVSo can we please dispense with this rhetoric
p340
aVthat says that rich guys like me
p341
aVand my plutocrat friends
p342
aVmade our country?
p343
aVWe plutocrats know,
p344
aVeven if we don't like to admit it in public,
p345
aVthat if we had been born somewhere else,
p346
aVnot here in the United States,
p347
aVwe might very well be just some dude standing barefoot
p348
aVby the side of a dirt road selling fruit.
p349
aVIt's not that they don't have good entrepreneurs in other places,
p350
aVeven very, very poor places.
p351
aVIt's just that that's all
p352
aVthat those entrepreneurs' customers can afford.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo here's an idea for a new kind of economics,
p355
aVa new kind of politics
p356
aVthat I call new capitalism.
p357
aVLet's acknowledge that capitalism
p358
aVbeats the alternatives,
p359
aVbut also that the more people we include,
p360
aVboth as entrepreneurs and as customers,
p361
aVthe better it works.
p362
aVLet's by all means shrink the size of government,
p363
aVbut not by slashing the poverty programs,
p364
aVbut by ensuring that workers are paid enough
p365
aVso that they actually don't need those programs.
p366
aVLet's invest enough in the middle class
p367
aVto make our economy fairer and more inclusive,
p368
aVand by fairer, more truly competitive,
p369
aVand by more truly competitive,
p370
aVmore able to generate the solutions
p371
aVto human problems
p372
aVthat are the true drivers of growth and prosperity.
p373
aVCapitalism is the greatest social technology
p374
aVever invented
p375
aVfor creating prosperity in human societies,
p376
aVif it is well managed,
p377
aVbut capitalism, because of the fundamental
p378
aVmultiplicative dynamics of complex systems,
p379
aVtends towards, inexorably, inequality,
p380
aVconcentration and collapse.
p381
aVThe work of democracies
p382
aVis to maximize the inclusion of the many
p383
aVin order to create prosperity,
p384
aVnot to enable the few to accumulate money.
p385
aVGovernment does create prosperity and growth,
p386
aVby creating the conditions that allow
p387
aVboth entrepreneurs and their customers
p388
aVto thrive.
p389
aVBalancing the power of capitalists like me
p390
aVand workers isn't bad for capitalism.
p391
aVIt's essential to it.
p392
aVPrograms like a reasonable minimum wage,
p393
aVaffordable healthcare,
p394
aVpaid sick leave,
p395
aVand the progressive taxation necessary
p396
aVto pay for the important infrastructure
p397
aVnecessary for the middle class like education, R and D,
p398
aVthese are indispensable tools
p399
aVshrewd capitalists should embrace
p400
aVto drive growth, because no one benefits from it
p401
aVlike us.
p402
aa(lp403
VMany economists would have you believe
p404
aVthat their field is an objective science.
p405
aVI disagree, and I think that it is equally
p406
aVa tool that humans use
p407
aVto enforce and encode
p408
aVour social and moral preferences and prejudices
p409
aVabout status and power,
p410
aVwhich is why plutocrats like me
p411
aVhave always needed to find persuasive stories
p412
aVto tell everyone else
p413
aVabout why our relative positions
p414
aVare morally righteous and good for everyone:
p415
aVlike, we are indispensable, the job creators,
p416
aVand you are not;
p417
aVlike, tax cuts for us create growth,
p418
aVbut investments in you
p419
aVwill balloon our debt
p420
aVand bankrupt our great country;
p421
aVthat we matter;
p422
aVthat you don't.
p423
aVFor thousands of years, these stories were called
p424
aVdivine right.
p425
aVToday, we have trickle-down economics.
p426
aVHow obviously, transparently self-serving
p427
aVall of this is.
p428
aVWe plutocrats need to see
p429
aVthat the United States of America made us,
p430
aVnot the other way around;
p431
aVthat a thriving middle class is the source
p432
aVof prosperity in capitalist economies,
p433
aVnot a consequence of it.
p434
aVAnd we should never forget
p435
aVthat even the best of us in the worst of circumstances
p436
aVare barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.
p437
aa(lp438
VFellow plutocrats, I think it may be time for us
p439
aVto recommit to our country,
p440
aVto commit to a new kind of capitalism
p441
aVwhich is both more inclusive and more effective,
p442
aVa capitalism that will ensure
p443
aVthat America's economy remains
p444
aVthe most dynamic and prosperous in the world.
p445
aVLet's secure the future for ourselves,
p446
aVour children and their children.
p447
aVOr alternatively, we could do nothing,
p448
aVhide in our gated communities
p449
aVand private schools,
p450
aVenjoy our planes and yachts
p451
aV\u2014 they're fun \u2014
p452
aVand wait for the pitchforks.
p453

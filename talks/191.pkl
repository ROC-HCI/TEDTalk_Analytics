VSo, I guess it is a result of globalization
p5
aVthat you can find Coca-Cola tins on top of Everest
p6
aVand a Buddhist monk in Monterey.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd so I just came, two days ago, from the Himalayas
p11
aVto your kind invitation.
p12
aVSo I would like to invite you, also, for a while, to the Himalayas themselves.
p13
aVAnd to show the place where meditators, like me,
p14
aVwho began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute,
p15
aVand found their way to the mountains.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo these are a few images I was lucky to take and be there.
p18
aVThere's Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet \u2014 wonderful setting.
p19
aVThis is from Marlboro country.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VThis is a turquoise lake.
p24
aVA meditator.
p25
aVThis is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.
p26
aVAnd the night before, we camped, and my Tibetan friends said,
p27
aV"We are going to sleep outside."
p28
aVAnd I said, "Why? We have enough space in the tent."
p29
aVThey said, "Yes, but it's summertime."
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VSo now, we are going to speak of happiness.
p34
aVAs a Frenchman, I must say
p35
aVthat there are a lot of French intellectuals
p36
aVthat think happiness is not at all interesting.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VI just wrote an essay on happiness, and there was a controversy.
p41
aVAnd someone wrote an article saying,
p42
aV"Don't impose on us the dirty work of happiness."
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
V"We don't care about being happy. We need to live with passion.
p47
aVWe like the ups and downs of life.
p48
aVWe like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while."
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VThis is what I see from the balcony of my hermitage in the Himalayas.
p53
aVIt's about two meters by three, and you are all welcome any time.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VNow, let's come to happiness or well-being.
p58
aVAnd first of all, you know, despite what the French intellectuals say,
p59
aVit seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking,
p60
aV"May I suffer the whole day?"
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VWhich means that somehow, consciously or not,
p65
aVdirectly or indirectly, in the short or the long term,
p66
aVwhatever we do, whatever we hope, whatever we dream \u2014
p67
aVsomehow, is related to a deep, profound desire for well-being or happiness.
p68
aVAs Pascal said, even the one who hangs himself,
p69
aVsomehow, is looking for cessation of suffering.
p70
aVHe finds no other way.
p71
aVBut then, if you look in the literature, East and West,
p72
aVyou can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness.
p73
aVSome people say, I only believed in remembering the past,
p74
aVimagining the future, never the present.
p75
aVSome people say happiness is right now;
p76
aVit's the quality of the freshness of the present moment.
p77
aVAnd that led Henri Bergson, the French philosopher, to say,
p78
aV"All the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague
p79
aVso that each of them could define their own terms."
p80
aa(lp81
VWell, that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life.
p82
aVBut now, if it is something that is going to determine
p83
aVthe quality of every instant of our life,
p84
aVthen we better know what it is, have some clearer idea.
p85
aVAnd probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often,
p86
aValthough we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it.
p87
aVAlthough we want to avoid suffering,
p88
aVit seems we are running somewhat towards it.
p89
aVAnd that can also come from some kind of confusions.
p90
aa(lp91
VOne of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure.
p92
aVBut if you look at the characteristics of those two,
p93
aVpleasure is contingent upon time, upon its object,
p94
aVupon the place.
p95
aVIt is something that \u2014 changes of nature.
p96
aVBeautiful chocolate cake: first serving is delicious,
p97
aVsecond one not so much, then we feel disgust.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VThat's the nature of things.
p102
aVWe get tired.
p103
aVI used to be a fan of Bach.
p104
aVI used to play it on the guitar, you know.
p105
aVI can hear it two, three, five times.
p106
aVIf I had to hear it 24 hours, non-stop, it might be very tiring.
p107
aVIf you are feeling very cold, you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.
p108
aVAfter some moments, you just go a little back,
p109
aVand then it starts burning.
p110
aVIt sort of uses itself as you experience it.
p111
aVAnd also, again, it can \u2014 also, it's something that you \u2014
p112
aVit is not something that is radiating outside.
p113
aVLike, you can feel intense pleasure
p114
aVand some others around you can be suffering a lot.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, what, then, will be happiness?
p117
aVAnd happiness, of course, is such a vague word, so let's say well-being.
p118
aVAnd so, I think the best definition, according to the Buddhist view,
p119
aVis that well-being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation.
p120
aVIt is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment.
p121
aVA state that actually pervades
p122
aVand underlies all emotional states,
p123
aVand all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way.
p124
aVFor you, that might be surprising.
p125
aVCan we have this kind of well-being while being sad?
p126
aVIn a way, why not?
p127
aVBecause we are speaking of a different level.
p128
aa(lp129
VLook at the waves coming near the shore.
p130
aVWhen you are at the bottom of the wave, you hit the bottom.
p131
aVYou hit the solid rock.
p132
aVWhen you are surfing on the top, you are all elated.
p133
aVSo you go from elation to depression \u2014 there's no depth.
p134
aVNow, if you look at the high sea,
p135
aVthere might be beautiful, calm ocean, like a mirror.
p136
aVThere might be storms,
p137
aVbut the depth of the ocean is still there, unchanged.
p138
aVSo now, how is that?
p139
aVIt can only be a state of being, not just a fleeting emotion, sensation.
p140
aVEven joy \u2014 that can be the spring of happiness.
p141
aVBut there's also wicked joy, you can rejoice in someone's suffering.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo how do we proceed in our quest for happiness?
p144
aVVery often, we look outside.
p145
aVWe think that if we could gather this and that, all the conditions,
p146
aVsomething that we say, "Everything to be happy \u2014
p147
aVto have everything to be happy."
p148
aVThat very sentence already reveals the doom, destruction of happiness.
p149
aVTo have everything.
p150
aVIf we miss something, it collapses.
p151
aVAnd also, when things go wrong, we try to fix the outside so much,
p152
aVbut our control of the outer world is limited,
p153
aVtemporary, and often, illusory.
p154
aVSo now, look at inner conditions.
p155
aVAren't they stronger?
p156
aVIsn't it the mind that translates
p157
aVthe outer condition into happiness and suffering?
p158
aVAnd isn't that stronger?
p159
aVWe know, by experience,
p160
aVthat we can be what we call "a little paradise,"
p161
aVand yet, be completely unhappy within.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe Dalai Lama was once in Portugal,
p164
aVand there was a lot of construction going on everywhere.
p165
aVSo one evening, he said, "Look, you are doing all these things,
p166
aVbut isn't it nice, also, to build something within?"
p167
aVAnd he said, "[Without] that \u2014 even if you get a high-tech flat
p168
aVon the 100th floor of a super-modern and comfortable building,
p169
aVif you are deeply unhappy within,
p170
aVall you are going to look for is a window from which to jump."
p171
aVSo now, at the opposite,
p172
aVwe know a lot of people who, in very difficult circumstances,
p173
aVmanage to keep serenity, inner strength, inner freedom, confidence.
p174
aVSo now, if the inner conditions are stronger \u2014
p175
aVof course, the outer conditions do influence,
p176
aVand it's wonderful to live longer, healthier,
p177
aVto have access to information, education,
p178
aVto be able to travel, to have freedom.
p179
aVIt's highly desirable.
p180
aVHowever, this is not enough.
p181
aVThose are just auxiliary, help conditions.
p182
aVThe experience that translates everything is within the mind.
p183
aVSo then, when we ask oneself
p184
aVhow to nurture the condition for happiness,
p185
aVthe inner conditions, and which are those which will undermine happiness.
p186
aVSo then, this just needs to have some experience.
p187
aa(lp188
VWe have to know from ourselves, there are certain states of mind
p189
aVthat are conducive to this flourishing, to this well-being,
p190
aVwhat the Greeks called eudaimonia, flourishing.
p191
aVThere are some which are adverse to this well-being.
p192
aVAnd so, if we look from our own experience,
p193
aVanger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance,
p194
aVobsessive desire, strong grasping,
p195
aVthey don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it.
p196
aVAnd also, they are detrimental to others' happiness.
p197
aVSo we may consider that the more those are invading our mind,
p198
aVand, like a chain reaction,
p199
aVthe more we feel miserable, we feel tormented.
p200
aVAt the opposite, everyone knows deep within
p201
aVthat an act of selfless generosity,
p202
aVif from the distance, without anyone knowing anything about it,
p203
aVwe could save a child's life, make someone happy.
p204
aVWe don't need the recognition. We don't need any gratitude.
p205
aVJust the mere fact of doing that
p206
aVfills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature.
p207
aVAnd we would like to be like that all the time.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo is that possible,
p210
aVto change our way of being, to transform one's mind?
p211
aVAren't those negative emotions, or destructive emotions,
p212
aVinherent to the nature of mind?
p213
aVIs change possible in our emotions, in our traits, in our moods?
p214
aVFor that we have to ask, what is the nature of mind?
p215
aVAnd if we look from the experiential point of view,
p216
aVthere is a primary quality of consciousness
p217
aVthat's just the mere fact to be cognitive, to be aware.
p218
aVConsciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it.
p219
aVYou can have ugly faces, beautiful faces in the mirror.
p220
aVThe mirror allows that, but the mirror is not tainted,
p221
aVis not modified, is not altered by those images.
p222
aVLikewise, behind every single thought
p223
aVthere is the bare consciousness, pure awareness.
p224
aVThis is the nature.
p225
aVIt cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then,
p226
aVif it was always there \u2014
p227
aVlike a dye that would permeate the whole cloth \u2014
p228
aVthen it would be found all the time, somewhere.
p229
aVWe know we're not always angry, always jealous, always generous.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo, because the basic fabric of consciousness
p232
aVis this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone,
p233
aVthere is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting.
p234
aVThat is the ground for mind training.
p235
aVMind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors
p236
aVcannot happen at the same time.
p237
aVYou could go from love to hate.
p238
aVBut you cannot, at the same time, toward the same object,
p239
aVthe same person, want to harm and want to do good.
p240
aVYou cannot, in the same gesture, shake hand and give a blow.
p241
aVSo, there are natural antidotes to emotions
p242
aVthat are destructive to our inner well-being.
p243
aVSo that's the way to proceed.
p244
aVRejoicing compared to jealousy.
p245
aVA kind of sense of inner freedom
p246
aVas opposite to intense grasping and obsession.
p247
aVBenevolence, loving kindness against hatred.
p248
aVBut, of course, each emotion then would need a particular antidote.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnother way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions,
p251
aVand that's by looking at the very nature.
p252
aVUsually, when we feel annoyed, hatred or upset with someone,
p253
aVor obsessed with something,
p254
aVthe mind goes again and again to that object.
p255
aVEach time it goes to the object,
p256
aVit reinforces that obsession or that annoyance.
p257
aVSo then, it's a self-perpetuating process.
p258
aVSo what we need to look for now is,
p259
aVinstead of looking outward, we look inward.
p260
aVLook at anger itself.
p261
aVIt looks very menacing,
p262
aVlike a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm.
p263
aVWe think we could sit on the cloud,
p264
aVbut if you go there, it's just mist.
p265
aVLikewise, if you look at the thought of anger,
p266
aVit will vanish like frost under the morning sun.
p267
aVIf you do this again and again, the propensity,
p268
aVthe tendencies for anger to arise again
p269
aVwill be less and less each time you dissolve it.
p270
aVAnd, at the end, although it may rise,
p271
aVit will just cross the mind,
p272
aVlike a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track.
p273
aVSo this is the principal of mind training.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow, it takes time,
p276
aVbecause it took time for all those faults in our mind, the tendencies, to build up,
p277
aVso it will take time to unfold them as well.
p278
aVBut that's the only way to go.
p279
aVMind transformation \u2014 that is the very meaning of meditation.
p280
aVIt means familiarization with a new way of being,
p281
aVnew way of perceiving things,
p282
aVwhich is more in adequation with reality,
p283
aVwith interdependence, with the stream and continuous transformation,
p284
aVwhich our being and our consciousness is.
p285
aa(lp286
VSo, the interface with cognitive science,
p287
aVsince we need to come to that, it was, I suppose, the subject of \u2014
p288
aVwe have to deal in such a short time \u2014 with brain plasticity.
p289
aVThe brain was thought to be more or less fixed.
p290
aVAll the nominal connections, in numbers and quantities,
p291
aVwere thought, until the last 20 years,
p292
aVto be more or less fixed when we reached adult age.
p293
aVNow, recently, it has been found that it can change a lot.
p294
aVA violinist, as we heard, who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice,
p295
aVsome area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain changes a lot,
p296
aVincreasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections.
p297
aVSo can we do that with human qualities?
p298
aVWith loving kindness, with patience, with openness?
p299
aa(lp300
VSo that's what those great meditators have been doing.
p301
aVSome of them who came to the labs,
p302
aVlike in Madison, Wisconsin, or in Berkeley,
p303
aVdid 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.
p304
aVThey do, like, three years' retreat, where they do meditate 12 hours a day.
p305
aVAnd then, the rest of their life, they will do three or four hours a day.
p306
aVThey are real Olympic champions of mind training.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VThis is the place where the meditators \u2014 you can see it's kind of inspiring.
p311
aVNow, here with 256 electrodes.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VSo what did they find?
p316
aVOf course, same thing.
p317
aVThe scientific embargo \u2014
p318
aVif it's ever submitted to "Nature," hopefully, it will be accepted.
p319
aVIt deals with the state of compassion, unconditional compassion.
p320
aVWe asked meditators, who have been doing that for years and years,
p321
aVto put their mind in a state where there's nothing but loving kindness,
p322
aVtotal availability to sentient being.
p323
aVOf course, during the training, we do that with objects.
p324
aVWe think of people suffering, of people we love,
p325
aVbut at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading.
p326
aVHere is the preliminary result,
p327
aVwhich I can show because it's already been shown.
p328
aVThe bell curve shows 150 controls,
p329
aVand what is being looked at
p330
aVis the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe.
p331
aVIn very short, people who have more activity
p332
aVin the right side of the prefrontal cortex
p333
aVare more depressed, withdrawn.
p334
aVThey don't describe a lot of positive affect.
p335
aVIt's the opposite on the left side:
p336
aVmore tendency to altruism,
p337
aVto happiness, to express, and curiosity and so forth.
p338
aVSo there's a basic line for people. And also, it can be changed.
p339
aVIf you see a comic movie, you go off to the left side.
p340
aVIf you are happy about something, you'll go more to the left side.
p341
aVIf you have a bout of depression, you'll go to the right side.
p342
aVHere, the -0.5 is the full standard deviation
p343
aVof a meditator who meditated on compassion.
p344
aVIt's something that is totally out of the bell curve.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo, I've no time to go into all the different scientific results.
p347
aVHopefully, they will come.
p348
aVBut they found that \u2014 this is after three and a half hours
p349
aVin an fMRI,
p350
aVit's like coming out of a space ship.
p351
aVAlso, it has been shown in other labs \u2014
p352
aVfor instance, Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley \u2014
p353
aVthat some meditators are able, also,
p354
aVto control their emotional response more than it could be thought.
p355
aVLike the startle experiments, for example.
p356
aVIf you sit a guy on a chair
p357
aVwith all this apparatus measuring your physiology,
p358
aVand there's kind of a bomb that goes off,
p359
aVit's such an instinctive response that,
p360
aVin 20 years, they never saw anyone who would not jump.
p361
aVSome meditators, without trying to stop it,
p362
aVbut simply by being completely open,
p363
aVthinking that that bang is just going to be a small event like a shooting star,
p364
aVthey are able not to move at all.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo the whole point of that is not, sort of, to make, like,
p367
aVa circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump, or whatever.
p368
aVIt's more to say that mind training matters.
p369
aVThat this is not just a luxury.
p370
aVThis is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul.
p371
aVThis is something that's going to determine
p372
aVthe quality of every instant of our lives.
p373
aVWe are ready to spend 15 years achieving education.
p374
aVWe love to do jogging, fitness.
p375
aVWe do all kinds of things to remain beautiful.
p376
aVYet, we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most \u2014
p377
aVthe way our mind functions \u2014
p378
aVwhich, again, is the ultimate thing
p379
aVthat determines the quality of our experience.
p380
aa(lp381
VNow, compassion is supposed to be put in action.
p382
aVThat's what we try to do in different places.
p383
aVJust this one example is worth a lot of work.
p384
aVThis lady with bone TB, left alone in a tent,
p385
aVwas going to die with her only daughter.
p386
aVOne year later, how she is.
p387
aVDifferent schools and clinics we've been doing in Tibet.
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd just, I leave you with the beauty of those looks
p390
aVthat tells more about happiness than I could ever say.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd jumping monks of Tibet.
p395
aa(lp396

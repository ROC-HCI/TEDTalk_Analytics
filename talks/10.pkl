VWith all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu \u2014
p5
aVand we'll hear about that from the
p6
aVbrilliant Dr. Brilliant later today \u2014
p7
aVI want to talk about the other pandemic, which is
p8
aVcardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension \u2014
p9
aVall of which are completely preventable for at
p10
aVleast 95 percent of people
p11
aVjust by changing diet and lifestyle.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd what's happening is that there's a
p14
aVglobalization of illness occurring, that people
p15
aVare starting to eat like us, and live like us, and
p16
aVdie like us. And in one generation, for example,
p17
aVAsia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of
p18
aVheart disease and obesity and diabetes to one
p19
aVof the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease
p20
aVequals the HIV and AIDS deaths
p21
aVin most countries.
p22
aVSo there's a critical window of opportunity we
p23
aVhave to make an important difference that can
p24
aVaffect the lives of literally millions of people,
p25
aVand practice preventive medicine on a global
p26
aVscale.
p27
aa(lp28
VHeart and blood vessel diseases still kill more
p29
aVpeople \u2014 not only in this country, but also
p30
aVworldwide \u2014 than everything else combined, and yet
p31
aVit's completely preventable for almost everybody.
p32
aVIt's not only preventable; it's actually
p33
aVreversible. And for the last almost 29 years,
p34
aVwe've been able to show that by simply changing
p35
aVdiet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech,
p36
aVexpensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how
p37
aVpowerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost
p38
aVinterventions can be like \u2014 quantitative
p39
aVarteriography, before and after a year, and
p40
aVcardiac PET scans.
p41
aa(lp42
VWe showed a few months ago \u2014 we published the
p43
aVfirst study showing you can actually stop or
p44
aVreverse the progression of prostate cancer by
p45
aVmaking changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent
p46
aVregression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of
p47
aVthe tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the
p48
aVcontrol group.
p49
aVAnd in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the
p50
aVprostate tumor activity is shown in red \u2014 you can
p51
aVsee it diminishing after a year.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of
p54
aVadults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning
p55
aVto me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the
p56
aVpast 10 years, and this may be the first
p57
aVgeneration in which our kids live a shorter life
p58
aVspan than we do. That's pitiful, and it's
p59
aVpreventable.
p60
aVNow these are not election returns, these are the
p61
aVpeople \u2014 the number of the people who are obese
p62
aVby state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 \u2014 these are
p63
aVfrom the CDC website \u2014 '88, '89, '90, '91 \u2014 you
p64
aVget a new category \u2014 '92, '93, '94, '95, '96,
p65
aV'97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 \u2014 it gets worse. We're
p66
aVkind of devolving. (Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VNow what can we do about this? Well, you know, the
p69
aVdiet that we've found that can reverse heart
p70
aVdisease and cancer is an Asian diet.
p71
aVBut the people in Asia are starting to eat like we
p72
aVare, which is why they're starting to get sick
p73
aVlike we are.
p74
aVSo I've been working with a lot of the big food
p75
aVcompanies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip
p76
aVand crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods,
p77
aVlike \u2014 I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's,
p78
aVand PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon
p79
aVDel Monte, and they're finding that it's good
p80
aVbusiness.
p81
aVThe salads that you see at McDonald's came from
p82
aVthe work \u2014 they're going to have an Asian salad. At
p83
aVPepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came
p84
aVfrom their better foods.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd so if we can do that, then we can free up
p87
aVresources for buying drugs that you really do need
p88
aVfor treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for
p89
aVpreventing avian flu. Thank you.

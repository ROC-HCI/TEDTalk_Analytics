VVirtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place.
p5
aVIt was the 1970s.
p6
aVI got into the field very young: I was seven years old.
p7
aVAnd the tool that I used  to access virtual reality
p8
aVwas the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.
p9
aVThis is a commercial for  that particular item:
p10
aV(Video) Voice-over: What a jump!
p11
aVEvel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.
p12
aVThat gyro-power sends him  over 100 feet at top speed.
p13
aa(lp14
VChris Milk: So this was my joy back then.
p15
aVI rode this motorcycle everywhere.
p16
aVAnd I was there with Evel Knievel; we  jumped the Snake River Canyon together.
p17
aVI wanted the rocket.
p18
aVI never got the rocket, I only got the motorcycle.
p19
aVI felt so connected to this world.
p20
aVI didn't want to be a storyteller  when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.
p21
aVI was there. Evel Knievel was my friend.
p22
aVI had so much empathy for him.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut it didn't work out. (Laughter)
p25
aVI went to art school.
p26
aVI started making music videos.
p27
aVAnd this is one of the early music videos that I made:
p28
aV(Music: "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West)
p29
aVCM: You may notice  some slight similarities here.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVAnd I got that rocket.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VSo, now I'm a filmmaker, or, the beginning of a filmmaker,
p35
aVand I started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker
p36
aVto try to tell the most compelling stories that I can to an audience.
p37
aVAnd film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy
p38
aVfor people that are very different than us
p39
aVand worlds completely  foreign from our own.
p40
aa(lp41
VUnfortunately,
p42
aVEvel Knievel did not feel the same  empathy for us that we felt for him,
p43
aVand he sued us for this video \u2014
p44
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p45
aVshortly thereafter.
p46
aVOn the upside, the man  that I worshipped as a child,
p47
aVthe man that I wanted  to become as an adult,
p48
aVI was finally able to get his autograph.
p49
aV(Applause)
p50
aa(lp51
VLet's talk about film now.
p52
aVFilm, it's an incredible medium,
p53
aVbut essentially, it's the same now as it was then.
p54
aVIt's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence.
p55
aVAnd we've done incredible things with those rectangles.
p56
aVBut I started thinking about,
p57
aVis there a way that I can use modern and developing technologies
p58
aVto tell stories in different ways
p59
aVand tell different kinds of stories
p60
aVthat maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking
p61
aVthat we've been using for 100 years?
p62
aVSo I started experimenting,
p63
aVand what I was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine.
p64
aVAnd here's one of the early experiments:
p65
aV(Music)
p66
aa(lp67
VSo this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."
p68
aVIt was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.
p69
aVIt asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it.
p70
aVIt's a website.
p71
aVAnd out of it starts growing these little boxes with different browser windows.
p72
aVAnd you see this teenager  running down a street,
p73
aVand then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery
p74
aVand you realize the street he's running down is yours.
p75
aVAnd when he stops in front of a house, he stops in front of your house.
p76
aVAnd this was great, and I saw people  having an even deeper emotional reaction
p77
aVto this than the things that  I had made in rectangles.
p78
aVAnd I'm essentially taking  a piece of your history
p79
aVand putting it inside  the framing of the story.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut then I started thinking,
p82
aVokay, well that's a part of you,
p83
aVbut how do I put all of you inside of the frame?
p84
aVSo to do that, I started making art installations.
p85
aVAnd this is one called  "The Treachery of Sanctuary."
p86
aVIt's a triptych. I'm going to show you the third panel.
p87
aV(Music)
p88
aVSo now I've got you inside of the frame,
p89
aVand I saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions
p90
aVto this work than the previous one.
p91
aa(lp92
VBut then I started thinking about frames, and what do they represent?
p93
aVAnd a frame is just a window.
p94
aVI mean, all the media that we watch \u2014 television, cinema \u2014
p95
aVthey're these windows into  these other worlds.
p96
aVAnd I thought, well, great.  I got you in a frame.
p97
aVBut I don't want you in the frame, I don't want you in the window,
p98
aVI want you through the window, I want you on the other side,
p99
aVin the world, inhabiting the world.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo that leads me back to virtual reality.
p102
aVLet's talk about virtual reality.
p103
aVUnfortunately,
p104
aVtalking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture.
p105
aVAnd this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVSo, it's difficult to explain. Why is it difficult to explain?
p108
aVIt's difficult because it's a very  experiential medium.
p109
aVYou feel your way inside of it.
p110
aVIt's a machine, but inside of it,
p111
aVit feels like real life, it feels like truth.
p112
aVAnd you feel present in the world that you're inside
p113
aVand you feel present with the people that you're inside of it with.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo, I'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film:
p116
aVa full-screen version of all the information
p117
aVthat we capture when we shoot virtual reality.
p118
aVSo we're shooting in every direction.
p119
aVThis is a camera system that we built
p120
aVthat has 3D cameras that look in every direction
p121
aVand binaural microphones that face in every direction.
p122
aVWe take this and we build, basically, a sphere of a world that you inhabit.
p123
aVSo what I'm going to show you is not a view into the world,
p124
aVit's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle.
p125
aVSo this film is called  "Clouds Over Sidra,"
p126
aVand it was made in conjunction with  our virtual reality company called VRSE
p127
aVand the United Nations,
p128
aVand a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.
p129
aVAnd we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan in December
p130
aVand shot the story of a 12-year-old girl there named Sidra.
p131
aVAnd she and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan
p132
aVand she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.
p135
aVI am 12 years old.
p136
aVI am in the fifth grade.
p137
aVI am from Syria, in the Daraa Province, Inkhil City.
p138
aVI have lived here in the Zaatari camp in Jordan for the last year and a half.
p139
aVI have a big family:
p140
aVthree brothers, one is a baby.
p141
aVHe cries a lot.
p142
aVI asked my father if I cried when  I was a baby and he says I did not.
p143
aVI think I was a stronger baby than my brother.
p144
aa(lp145
VCM: So, when you're inside  of the headset.
p146
aVyou're not seeing it like this.
p147
aVYou're looking around through this world.
p148
aVYou'll notice you see full 360 degrees, in all directions.
p149
aVAnd when you're sitting there in her room, watching her,
p150
aVyou're not watching it through a television screen,
p151
aVyou're not watching it through a window, you're sitting there with her.
p152
aVWhen you look down, you're sitting on the same ground that she's sitting on.
p153
aVAnd because of that,
p154
aVyou feel her humanity in a deeper way.
p155
aVYou empathize with her in a deeper way.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd I think that we can change minds with this machine.
p158
aVAnd we've already started to try to change a few.
p159
aVSo we took this film to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.
p160
aVAnd we showed it to a group of people
p161
aVwhose decisions affect the lives of millions of people.
p162
aVAnd these are people  who might not otherwise
p163
aVbe sitting in a tent  in a refugee camp in Jordan.
p164
aVBut in January, one afternoon in Switzerland,
p165
aVthey suddenly all found themselves there.
p166
aV(Applause)
p167
aVAnd they were affected by it.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo we're going to make more of them.
p170
aVWe're working with the  United Nations right now
p171
aVto shoot a whole series of these films.
p172
aVWe just finished shooting a story in Liberia.
p173
aVAnd now, we're going  to shoot a story in India.
p174
aVAnd we're taking these films,
p175
aVand we're showing them  at the United Nations
p176
aVto people that work there and people that are visiting there.
p177
aVAnd we're showing  them to the people
p178
aVthat can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface
p181
aVof the true power of virtual reality.
p182
aVIt's not a video game peripheral.
p183
aVIt connects humans to other humans in a profound way
p184
aVthat I've never seen before  in any other form of media.
p185
aVAnd it can change people's perception of each other.
p186
aVAnd that's how I think
p187
aVvirtual reality has the potential to actually change the world.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo, it's a machine,
p190
aVbut through this machine we become more compassionate,
p191
aVwe become more empathetic, and we become more connected.
p192
aVAnd ultimately, we become more human.
p193
aa(lp194
VThank you.

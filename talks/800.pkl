(lp4
VSo, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth."
p5
aVAnd we're all talking about this great English icon and saying,
p6
aV"She's a fantastic woman, she does everything.
p7
aVHow are we going to introduce her?"
p8
aVSo we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer,
p9
aVand they came to me and said, "Shekhar, what do you think?"
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd I said, "I think she's dancing."
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd I could see everybody looked at me,
p14
aVsomebody said, "Bollywood."
p15
aa(lp16
VThe other said, "How much did we hire him for?"
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd the third said, "Let's find another director."
p19
aa(lp20
VI thought I had better change.
p21
aVSo we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth,
p22
aVand I said, "OK, maybe I am too Bollywood.
p23
aVMaybe Elizabeth, this great icon, dancing?
p24
aVWhat are you talking about?"
p25
aVSo I rethought the whole thing,
p26
aVand then we all came to a consensus.
p27
aVAnd here was the introduction of this
p28
aVgreat British icon called "Elizabeth."
p29
aa(lp30
VLeicester: May I join you, my lady?
p31
aa(lp32
VElizabeth: If it please you, sir.
p33
aV(Music)
p34
aa(lp35
VShekhar Kapur: So she was dancing.
p36
aVSo how many people who saw the film did not get
p37
aVthat here was a woman in love,
p38
aVthat she was completely innocent
p39
aVand saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful?
p40
aVAnd how many of you did not get that?
p41
aVThat's the power of visual storytelling,
p42
aVthat's the power of dance, that's the power of music:
p43
aVthe power of not knowing.
p44
aa(lp45
VWhen I go out to direct a film,
p46
aVevery day we prepare too much, we think too much.
p47
aVKnowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom.
p48
aVYou know, simple words lost
p49
aVin the quicksand of experience.
p50
aVSo I come up, and I say,
p51
aV"What am I going to do today?" I'm not going to do what I planned to do,
p52
aVand I put myself into absolute panic.
p53
aVIt's my one way of getting rid of my mind,
p54
aVgetting rid of this mind that says,
p55
aV"Hey, you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing.
p56
aVYou're a director, you've done it for years."
p57
aVSo I've got to get there
p58
aVand be in complete panic.
p59
aVIt's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script,
p60
aVI go and I panic myself, I get scared.
p61
aVI'm doing it right now; you can watch me. I'm getting nervous,
p62
aVI don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd as I go there, of course, my A.D. says,
p65
aV"You know what you're going to do, sir." I say, "Of course I do."
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd the studio executives, they would say,
p68
aV"Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared."
p69
aVAnd inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan
p70
aVbecause he's chaotic.
p71
aVI'm allowing myself to go into chaos
p72
aVbecause out of chaos, I'm hoping some moments of truth will come.
p73
aVAll preparation is preparation.
p74
aVI don't even know if it's honest.
p75
aVI don't even know if it's truthful.
p76
aVThe truth of it all comes on the moment, organically,
p77
aVand if you get five great moments
p78
aVof great, organic stuff
p79
aVin your storytelling, in your film,
p80
aVyour film, audiences will get it.
p81
aVSo I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing there
p82
aVand saying, "I don't know what to say."
p83
aa(lp84
VSo, ultimately, everybody's looking at you,
p85
aV200 people at seven in the morning
p86
aVwho got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven,
p87
aVand everybody's saying,
p88
aV"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?"
p89
aVAnd you put yourself into a state of panic
p90
aVwhere you don't know, and so you don't know.
p91
aVAnd so, because you don't know,
p92
aVyou're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe
p93
aVthat something \u2014 I'm going to try and access the universe
p94
aVthe way Einstein \u2014 say a prayer \u2014
p95
aVaccessed his equations,
p96
aVthe same source. I'm looking for the same source
p97
aVbecause creativity comes from absolutely the same source
p98
aVthat you meditate somewhere outside yourself,
p99
aVoutside the universe.
p100
aVYou're looking for something that comes and hits you.
p101
aVUntil that hits you, you're not going to do the first shot.
p102
aVSo what do you do?
p103
aa(lp104
VSo Cate says, "Shekhar, what do you want me to do?"
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd I say, "Cate, what do you want to do?" (Laughter)
p107
aV"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors \u2014
p108
aVwhy don't you show me what you want to do?"
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aVWhat am I doing? I'm trying to buy time.
p111
aVI'm trying to buy time.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo the first thing about storytelling that I learned,
p114
aVand I follow all the time is: Panic.
p115
aVPanic is the great access of creativity
p116
aVbecause that's the only way to get rid of your mind.
p117
aVGet rid of your mind.
p118
aVGet out of it, get it out.
p119
aVAnd let's go to the universe because
p120
aVthere's something out there that is more
p121
aVtruthful than your mind,
p122
aVthat is more truthful than your universe.
p123
aV[unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it
p124
aVbecause that's what I follow constantly
p125
aVto find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness.
p126
aVOut of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity.
p127
aVSo that's what I do.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhen I was a kid \u2014 I was about eight years old.
p130
aVYou remember how India was. There was no pollution.
p131
aVIn Delhi, we used to live \u2014 we used to call it a chhat or the khota.
p132
aVKhota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace \u2014
p133
aVand we used to sleep out at night.
p134
aVAt school I was being just taught about physics,
p135
aVand I was told that
p136
aVif there is something that exists,
p137
aVthen it is measurable.
p138
aVIf it is not measurable,
p139
aVit does not exist.
p140
aVAnd at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky,
p141
aVas Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid,
p142
aVand I used to stare at the universe and say,
p143
aV"How far does this universe go?"
p144
aa(lp145
VMy father was a doctor.
p146
aVAnd I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd he said, "Son, it goes on forever."
p149
aa(lp150
VSo I said, "Please measure forever
p151
aVbecause in school they're teaching me
p152
aVthat if I cannot measure it, it does not exist.
p153
aVIt doesn't come into my frame of reference."
p154
aVSo, how far does eternity go?
p155
aVWhat does forever mean?
p156
aVAnd I would lie there crying at night
p157
aVbecause my imagination could not touch creativity.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo what did I do?
p160
aVAt that time, at the tender age of seven,
p161
aVI created a story.
p162
aVWhat was my story?
p163
aVAnd I don't know why, but I remember the story.
p164
aVThere was a woodcutter
p165
aVwho's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,
p166
aVand the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.
p167
aVAnd when that ax hits that piece of wood,
p168
aVthat's when everything will destroy
p169
aVand the Big Bang will happen again.
p170
aVBut all before that there was a woodcutter.
p171
aVAnd then when I would run out of that story,
p172
aVI would imagine that woodcutter's universe
p173
aVis one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.
p174
aVSo every time, I could tell my story again and again
p175
aVand get over this problem,
p176
aVand so I got over the problem.
p177
aa(lp178
VHow did I do it? Tell a story.
p179
aVSo what is a story?
p180
aVA story is our \u2014 all of us \u2014
p181
aVwe are the stories we tell ourselves.
p182
aVIn this universe, and this existence,
p183
aVwhere we live with this duality
p184
aVof whether we exist or not
p185
aVand who are we,
p186
aVthe stories we tell ourselves are the stories
p187
aVthat define the potentialities
p188
aVof our existence.
p189
aVWe are the stories we tell ourselves.
p190
aVSo that's as wide as we look at stories.
p191
aVA story is the relationship
p192
aVthat you develop between who you are,
p193
aVor who you potentially are,
p194
aVand the infinite world, and that's our mythology.
p195
aa(lp196
VWe tell our stories,
p197
aVand a person without a story does not exist.
p198
aVSo Einstein told a story
p199
aVand followed his stories and came up with theories
p200
aVand came up with theories and then came up with his equations.
p201
aVAlexander had a story that his mother used to tell him,
p202
aVand he went out to conquer the world.
p203
aVWe all, everybody, has a story that they follow.
p204
aVWe tell ourselves stories.
p205
aVSo, I will go further, and I say,
p206
aV"I tell a story, and therefore I exist."
p207
aVI exist because there are stories,
p208
aVand if there are no stories, we don't exist.
p209
aVWe create stories to define our existence.
p210
aVIf we do not create the stories,
p211
aVwe probably go mad.
p212
aVI don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, a film.
p215
aVA film tells a story.
p216
aVI often wonder when I make a film \u2014 I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha \u2014
p217
aVand I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements
p218
aVthat are given to a director \u2014
p219
aVif he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera \u2014
p220
aVwould we get Buddhism better?
p221
aVBut that puts some kind of burden on me.
p222
aVI have to tell a story
p223
aVin a much more elaborate way,
p224
aVbut I have the potential.
p225
aVIt's called subtext.
p226
aVWhen I first went to Hollywood, they said \u2014
p227
aVI used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,
p228
aV"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?"
p229
aVAnd I said, "Why?" He said, "Because nobody is going to give you a film
p230
aVif you talk about subtext.
p231
aVJust talk about plot
p232
aVand say how wonderful you'll shoot the film,
p233
aVwhat the visuals will be."
p234
aa(lp235
VSo when I look at a film,
p236
aVhere's what we look for:
p237
aVWe look for a story on the plot level,
p238
aVthen we look for a story
p239
aVon the psychological level,
p240
aVthen we look for a story on the political level,
p241
aVthen we look at a story
p242
aVon a mythological level.
p243
aVAnd I look for stories on each level.
p244
aVNow, it is not necessary
p245
aVthat these stories agree with each other.
p246
aVWhat is wonderful is,
p247
aVat many times, the stories will contradict with each other.
p248
aVSo when I work with Rahman who's a great musician,
p249
aVI often tell him, "Don't follow what the script already says.
p250
aVFind that which is not.
p251
aVFind the truth for yourself,
p252
aVand when you find the truth for yourself,
p253
aVthere will be a truth in it, but it may contradict the plot,
p254
aVbut don't worry about it."
p255
aa(lp256
VSo, the sequel to "Elizabeth," "Golden Age."
p257
aVWhen I made the sequel to "Elizabeth," here was a story that
p258
aVthe writer was telling:
p259
aVA woman who was threatened
p260
aVby Philip II
p261
aVand was going to war,
p262
aVand was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.
p263
aVBecause she fell in love with Walter Raleigh,
p264
aVshe was giving up the reasons she was a queen,
p265
aVand then Walter Raleigh
p266
aVfell in love with her lady in waiting,
p267
aVand she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war
p268
aVor she wanted...
p269
aa(lp270
VHere's the story I was telling:
p271
aVThe gods up there,
p272
aVthere were two people.
p273
aVThere was Philip II, who was divine
p274
aVbecause he was always praying,
p275
aVand there was Elizabeth, who was divine,
p276
aVbut not quite divine because she thought she was divine,
p277
aVbut the blood of being mortal flowed in her.
p278
aVBut the divine one was unjust,
p279
aVso the gods said,
p280
aV"OK, what we need to do is
p281
aVhelp the just one."
p282
aVAnd so they helped the just one.
p283
aVAnd what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh down
p284
aVto physically separate her mortal self
p285
aVfrom her spirit self.
p286
aVAnd the mortal self was the girl
p287
aVthat Walter Raleigh was sent,
p288
aVand gradually he separated her
p289
aVso she was free to be divine.
p290
aVAnd the two divine people fought,
p291
aVand the gods were on the side of divinity.
p292
aa(lp293
VOf course, all the British press got really upset.
p294
aVThey said, "We won the Armada."
p295
aa(lp296
VBut I said, "But the storm won the Armada.
p297
aVThe gods sent the storm."
p298
aa(lp299
VSo what was I doing?
p300
aVI was trying to find a mythic reason
p301
aVto make the film.
p302
aVOf course, when I asked Cate Blanchett, I said, "What's the film about?"
p303
aVShe said, "The film's about a woman
p304
aVcoming to terms with growing older."
p305
aVPsychological.
p306
aVThe writer said "It's about history, plot."
p307
aVI said "It's about mythology,
p308
aVthe gods."
p309
aa(lp310
VSo let me show you a film \u2014
p311
aVa piece from that film \u2014
p312
aVand how a camera also \u2014
p313
aVso this is a scene, where in my mind,
p314
aVshe was at the depths of mortality.
p315
aVShe was discovering what mortality actually means,
p316
aVand if she is at the depths of mortality,
p317
aVwhat really happens.
p318
aVAnd she's recognizing the dangers of mortality
p319
aVand why she should break away from mortality.
p320
aVRemember, in the film, to me,
p321
aVboth her and her lady in waiting
p322
aVwere parts of the same body,
p323
aVone the mortal self
p324
aVand one the spirit self.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo can we have that second?
p327
aa(lp328
V(Music)
p329
aa(lp330
VElizabeth: Bess?
p331
aVBess?
p332
aVBess Throckmorton?
p333
aa(lp334
VBess: Here, my lady.
p335
aa(lp336
VElizabeth: Tell me, is it true?
p337
aVAre you with child?
p338
aVAre you with child?
p339
aa(lp340
VBess: Yes, my lady.
p341
aa(lp342
VElizabeth: Traitorous.
p343
aVYou dare to keep secrets from me?
p344
aVYou ask my permission before you rut,
p345
aVbefore you breed.
p346
aVMy bitches wear my collars.
p347
aVDo you hear me? Do you hear me?
p348
aa(lp349
VWalsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy.
p350
aa(lp351
VElizabeth: This is no time for mercy, Walsingham.
p352
aVYou go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.
p353
aVIs it his?
p354
aVTell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his?
p355
aa(lp356
VBess: Yes.
p357
aVMy lady,
p358
aVit is my husband's child.
p359
aVElizabeth: Bitch! (Cries)
p360
aa(lp361
VRaleigh: Majesty.
p362
aVThis is not the queen I love and serve.
p363
aa(lp364
VElizabeth: This man has seduced a ward of the queen,
p365
aVand she has married without royal consent.
p366
aVThese offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him.
p367
aVGo.
p368
aVYou no longer have the queen's protection.
p369
aa(lp370
VBess: As you wish, Majesty.
p371
aa(lp372
VElizabeth: Get out! Get out! Get out!
p373
aVGet out.
p374
aa(lp375
V(Music)
p376
aa(lp377
VShekhar Kapur: So, what am I trying to do here?
p378
aVElizabeth has realized,
p379
aVand she's coming face-to-face
p380
aVwith her own sense of jealousy,
p381
aVher own sense of mortality.
p382
aVWhat am I doing with the architecture?
p383
aVThe architecture is telling a story.
p384
aVThe architecture is telling a story
p385
aVabout how, even though she's the most powerful woman
p386
aVin the world at that time,
p387
aVthere is the other, the architecture's bigger.
p388
aVThe stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic.
p389
aVIt'll survive her.
p390
aVSo it's telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny.
p391
aVNot only that, why is the camera looking down?
p392
aVThe camera's looking down at her because she's in the well.
p393
aVShe's in the absolute well
p394
aVof her own sense of being mortal.
p395
aVThat's where she has to pull herself out
p396
aVfrom the depths of mortality,
p397
aVcome in, release her spirit.
p398
aVAnd that's the moment where, in my mind,
p399
aVboth Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.
p400
aVBut that's the moment
p401
aVshe's surgically removing herself from that.
p402
aVSo the film is operating on
p403
aVmany many levels in that scene.
p404
aVAnd how we tell stories
p405
aVvisually, with music, with actors,
p406
aVand at each level it's a different sense
p407
aVand sometimes contradictory to each other.
p408
aVSo how do I start all this?
p409
aVWhat's the process of telling a story?
p410
aa(lp411
VAbout ten years ago,
p412
aVI heard this little thing from a politician,
p413
aVnot a politician that was very well respected in India.
p414
aVAnd he said that these people in the cities,
p415
aVin one flush, expend as much water
p416
aVas you people in the rural areas
p417
aVdon't get for your family for two days.
p418
aVThat struck a chord, and I said, "That's true."
p419
aVI went to see a friend of mine,
p420
aVand he made me wait
p421
aVin his apartment in Malabar Hill
p422
aVon the twentieth floor,
p423
aVwhich is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai.
p424
aVAnd he was having a shower for 20 minutes.
p425
aVI got bored and left, and as I drove out,
p426
aVI drove past the slums of Bombay,
p427
aVas you always do,
p428
aVand I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun
p429
aVof women and children with buckets
p430
aVwaiting for a tanker
p431
aVto come and give them water.
p432
aVAnd an idea started to develop.
p433
aVSo how does that become a story?
p434
aVI suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.
p435
aa(lp436
VSo my next film is called "Paani"
p437
aVwhich means water.
p438
aVAnd now, out of the mythology of that,
p439
aVI'm starting to create a world.
p440
aVWhat kind of world do I create,
p441
aVand where does the idea, the design of that come?
p442
aVSo, in my mind, in the future,
p443
aVthey started to build flyovers.
p444
aVYou understand flyovers? Yeah?
p445
aVThey started to build flyovers
p446
aVto get from A to B faster,
p447
aVbut they effectively went from one area of relative wealth
p448
aVto another area of relative wealth.
p449
aVAnd then what they did was
p450
aVthey created a city above the flyovers.
p451
aVAnd the rich people moved to the upper city
p452
aVand left the poorer people in the lower cities,
p453
aVabout 10 to 12 percent of the people
p454
aVhave moved to the upper city.
p455
aa(lp456
VNow, where does this upper city and lower city come?
p457
aVThere's a mythology in India about \u2014
p458
aVwhere they say, and I'll say it in Hindi,
p459
aV[Hindi]
p460
aVRight. What does that mean?
p461
aVIt says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders
p462
aVand survive on the shoulders of the poor.
p463
aVSo, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come.
p464
aVSo the design has a story.
p465
aa(lp466
VAnd now, what happens is that the people of the upper city,
p467
aVthey suck up all the water.
p468
aVRemember the word I said, suck up.
p469
aVThey suck up all the water, keep to themselves,
p470
aVand they drip feed the lower city.
p471
aVAnd if there's any revolution, they cut off the water.
p472
aVAnd, because democracy still exists,
p473
aVthere's a democratic way in which you say
p474
aV"Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water."
p475
aa(lp476
VSo, okay my time is up.
p477
aVBut I can go on about telling you
p478
aVhow we evolve stories,
p479
aVand how stories effectively are who we are
p480
aVand how these get translated into the particular discipline
p481
aVthat I am in, which is film.
p482
aVBut ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction.
p483
aVEverything's a contradiction.
p484
aVThe universe is a contradiction.
p485
aVAnd all of us are constantly looking for harmony.
p486
aVWhen you get up, the night and day is a contradiction.
p487
aVBut you get up at 4 a.m.
p488
aVThat first blush of blue is where the night and day
p489
aVare trying to find harmony with each other.
p490
aVHarmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you,
p491
aVbut somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that.
p492
aVAll contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony.
p493
aVIt's the effect of looking for harmony
p494
aVin the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind,
p495
aVa contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind.
p496
aVIn a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities.
p497
aVIn a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words,
p498
aVin the universe's mind, between day and night.
p499
aVIn the mind of a man and a woman,
p500
aVwe're looking constantly at
p501
aVthe contradiction between male and female,
p502
aVwe're looking for harmony within each other.
p503
aa(lp504
VThe whole idea of contradiction,
p505
aVbut the acceptance of contradiction
p506
aVis the telling of a story, not the resolution.
p507
aVThe problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood
p508
aVand many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his,
p509
aVthat we try to resolve the contradiction.
p510
aVHarmony is not resolution.
p511
aVHarmony is the suggestion of a thing
p512
aVthat is much larger than resolution.
p513
aVHarmony is the suggestion of something
p514
aVthat is embracing and universal
p515
aVand of eternity and of the moment.
p516
aVResolution is something that is far more limited.
p517
aVIt is finite; harmony is infinite.
p518
aVSo that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe,
p519
aVis looking for harmony and infinity
p520
aVin moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go,
p521
aVletting another go and creating a question that is really important.
p522
aa(lp523
VThank you very much.
p524
aV(Applause)

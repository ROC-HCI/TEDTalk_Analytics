VSo my freshman year of college
p5
aVI signed up for an internship in the housing unit
p6
aVat Greater Boston Legal Services.
p7
aVShowed up the first day
p8
aVready to make coffee and photocopies,
p9
aVbut was paired with this righteous, deeply inspired attorney
p10
aVnamed Jeff Purcell,
p11
aVwho thrust me onto the front lines
p12
aVfrom the very first day.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd over the course of nine months
p15
aVI had the chance
p16
aVto have dozens of conversations
p17
aVwith low-income families in Boston
p18
aVwho would come in presenting with housing issues,
p19
aVbut always had an underlying health issue.
p20
aVSo I had a client who came in,
p21
aVabout to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent.
p22
aVBut he hasn't paid his rent, of course,
p23
aVbecause he's paying for his HIV medication
p24
aVand just can't afford both.
p25
aVWe had moms who would come in,
p26
aVdaughter has asthma,
p27
aVwakes up covered in cockroaches every morning.
p28
aVAnd one of our litigation strategies
p29
aVwas actually to send me into the home of these clients
p30
aVwith these large glass bottles.
p31
aVAnd I would collect the cockroaches,
p32
aVhot glue-gun them to this poster board
p33
aVthat we'd bring to court for our cases.
p34
aVAnd we always won
p35
aVbecause the judges were just so grossed out.
p36
aVFar more effective, I have to say,
p37
aVthan anything I later learned in law school.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut over the course of these nine months,
p40
aVI grew frustrated with feeling
p41
aVlike we were intervening too far downstream
p42
aVin the lives of our clients \u2014
p43
aVthat by the time they came to us,
p44
aVthey were already in crisis.
p45
aVAnd at the end of my freshman year of college,
p46
aVI read an article about the work
p47
aVthat Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing
p48
aVas Chair of Pediatrics
p49
aVat Boston Medical Center.
p50
aVAnd his first hire was a legal services attorney
p51
aVto represent the patients.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo I called Barry,
p54
aVand with his blessing, in October 1995
p55
aVwalked into the waiting room
p56
aVof the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center.
p57
aVI'll never forget,
p58
aVthe TVs played this endless reel of cartoons.
p59
aVAnd the exhaustion of mothers
p60
aVwho had taken two, three, sometimes four buses
p61
aVto bring their child to the doctor
p62
aVwas just palpable.
p63
aa(lp64
VThe doctors, it seemed,
p65
aVnever really had enough time for all the patients,
p66
aVtry as they might.
p67
aVAnd over the course of six months,
p68
aVI would corner them in the hallway
p69
aVand ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question:
p70
aV"If you had unlimited resources,
p71
aVwhat's the one thing you would give your patients?"
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd I heard the same story again and again,
p74
aVa story we've heard hundreds of times since then.
p75
aVThey said, "Every day we have patients that come into the clinic \u2014
p76
aVchild has an ear infection,
p77
aVI prescribe antibiotics.
p78
aVBut the real issue is there's no food at home.
p79
aVThe real issue
p80
aVis that child is living with 12 other people
p81
aVin a two-bedroom apartment.
p82
aVAnd I don't even ask about those issues
p83
aVbecause there's nothing I can do.
p84
aVI have 13 minutes with each patient.
p85
aVPatients are piling up in the clinic waiting room.
p86
aVI have no idea where the nearest food pantry is.
p87
aVAnd I don't even have any help."
p88
aVIn that clinic, even today,
p89
aVthere are two social workers
p90
aVfor 24,000 pediatric patients,
p91
aVwhich is better than a lot of the clinics out there.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo Health Leads was born of these conversations \u2014
p94
aVa simple model
p95
aVwhere doctors and nurses
p96
aVcan prescribe nutritious food,
p97
aVheat in the winter
p98
aVand other basic resources for their patients
p99
aVthe same way they prescribe medication.
p100
aVPatients then take their prescriptions
p101
aVto our desk in the clinic waiting room
p102
aVwhere we have a core of well-trained college student advocates
p103
aVwho work side by side with these families
p104
aVto connect them out
p105
aVto the existing landscape of community resources.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room \u2014
p108
aVtotally lemonade stand style.
p109
aVBut today we have a thousand college student advocates
p110
aVwho are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families
p111
aVwith the resources that they need to be healthy.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo 18 months ago
p114
aVI got this email that changed my life.
p115
aVAnd the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger,
p116
aVwho had written to congratulate me on Health Leads
p117
aVand to share, as he said,
p118
aVa bit of historical context.
p119
aVIn 1965 Dr. Geiger founded
p120
aVone of the first two community health centers in this country,
p121
aVin a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta.
p122
aVAnd so many of his patients came in
p123
aVpresenting with malnutrition
p124
aVthat be began prescribing food for them.
p125
aVAnd they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket,
p126
aVwhich would fill them
p127
aVand then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic.
p128
aVAnd when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C. \u2014
p129
aVwhich was funding Geiger's clinic \u2014
p130
aVfound out about this,
p131
aVthey were furious.
p132
aVAnd they sent this bureaucrat down
p133
aVto tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars
p134
aVfor medical care \u2014
p135
aVto which Geiger famously and logically responded,
p136
aV"The last time I checked my textbooks,
p137
aVthe specific therapy for malnutrition was food."
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VSo when I got this email from Dr. Geiger,
p142
aVI knew I was supposed to be proud
p143
aVto be part of this history.
p144
aVBut the truth is
p145
aVI was devastated.
p146
aVHere we are,
p147
aV45 years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients,
p148
aVand I have doctors telling me,
p149
aV"On those issues, we practice a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy."
p150
aVForty-five years after Geiger,
p151
aVHealth Leads has to reinvent
p152
aVthe prescription for basic resources.
p153
aVSo I have spent hours upon hours
p154
aVtrying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day.
p155
aVHow is it that if for decades
p156
aVwe had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients,
p157
aVand especially low-income patients, healthy,
p158
aVthat we didn't use it?
p159
aVIf we know what it takes to have a healthcare system
p160
aVrather than a sick-care system,
p161
aVwhy don't we just do it?
p162
aa(lp163
VThese questions, in my mind,
p164
aVare not hard because the answers are complicated,
p165
aVthey are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves.
p166
aVMy belief is that it's almost too painful
p167
aVto articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system,
p168
aVor even admit that we have any at all.
p169
aVBecause if we did,
p170
aVthey would be so removed
p171
aVfrom our current reality.
p172
aVBut that doesn't change my belief
p173
aVthat all of us, deep inside,
p174
aVhere in this room and across this country,
p175
aVshare a similar set of desires.
p176
aVThat if we are honest with ourselves
p177
aVand listen quietly,
p178
aVthat we all harbor
p179
aVone fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare:
p180
aVthat it keep us healthy.
p181
aa(lp182
VThis aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy
p183
aVis an enormously powerful one.
p184
aVAnd the way I think about this
p185
aVis that healthcare is like any other system.
p186
aVIt's just a set of choices that people make.
p187
aVWhat if we decided
p188
aVto make a different set of choices?
p189
aVWhat if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare
p190
aVthat have drifted away from us
p191
aVand stand firm and say, "No.
p192
aVThese things are ours.
p193
aVThey will be used for our purposes.
p194
aVThey will be used to realize
p195
aVour aspiration"?
p196
aVWhat if everything we needed
p197
aVto realize our aspiration for healthcare
p198
aVwas right there in front of us
p199
aVjust waiting to be claimed?
p200
aa(lp201
VSo that's where Health Leads began.
p202
aVWe started with the prescription pad \u2014
p203
aVa very ordinary piece of paper \u2014
p204
aVand we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy \u2014
p205
aVantibiotics, an inhaler, medication \u2014
p206
aVbut what do patients need to be healthy,
p207
aVto not get sick in the first place?
p208
aVAnd we chose to use the prescription
p209
aVfor that purpose.
p210
aVSo just a few miles from here
p211
aVat Children's National Medical Center,
p212
aVwhen patients come into the doctor's office,
p213
aVthey're asked a few questions.
p214
aVThey're asked, "Are you running out of food at the end of the month?
p215
aVDo you have safe housing?"
p216
aVAnd when the doctor begins the visit,
p217
aVshe knows height, weight, is there food at home,
p218
aVis the family living in a shelter.
p219
aVAnd that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices,
p220
aVbut the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient,
p221
aVusing Health Leads like any other sub-specialty referral.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe problem is,
p224
aVonce you get a taste of what it's like
p225
aVto realize your aspiration for healthcare,
p226
aVyou want more.
p227
aVSo we thought,
p228
aVif we can get individual doctors
p229
aVto prescribe these basic resources for their patients,
p230
aVcould we get an entire healthcare system
p231
aVto shift its presumption?
p232
aVAnd we gave it a shot.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo now at Harlem Hospital Center
p235
aVwhen patients come in with an elevated body mass index,
p236
aVthe electronic medical record
p237
aVautomatically generates a prescription for Health Leads.
p238
aVAnd our volunteers can then work with them
p239
aVto connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs
p240
aVin their communities.
p241
aVWe've created a presumption
p242
aVthat if you're a patient at that hospital
p243
aVwith an elevated BMI,
p244
aVthe four walls of the doctor's office
p245
aVprobably aren't going to give you everything
p246
aVyou need to be healthy.
p247
aVYou need more.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo on the one hand,
p250
aVthis is just a basic recoding
p251
aVof the electronic medical record.
p252
aVAnd on the other hand,
p253
aVit's a radical transformation
p254
aVof the electronic medical record
p255
aVfrom a static repository of diagnostic information
p256
aVto a health promotion tool.
p257
aVIn the private sector,
p258
aVwhen you squeeze that kind of additional value
p259
aVout of a fixed-cost investment,
p260
aVit's called a billion-dollar company.
p261
aVBut in my world,
p262
aVit's called reduced obesity and diabetes.
p263
aVIt's called healthcare \u2014
p264
aVa system where doctors can prescribe solutions
p265
aVto improve health,
p266
aVnot just manage disease.
p267
aa(lp268
VSame thing in the clinic waiting room.
p269
aVSo every day in this country
p270
aVthree million patients
p271
aVpass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country.
p272
aVAnd what do they do when they're there?
p273
aVThey sit, they watch the goldfish in the fish tank,
p274
aVthey read extremely old copies
p275
aVof Good Housekeeping magazine.
p276
aVBut mostly we all just sit there forever, waiting.
p277
aVHow did we get here
p278
aVwhere we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours
p279
aVto waiting?
p280
aVWhat if we had a waiting room
p281
aVwhere you don't just sit when you're sick,
p282
aVbut where you go to get healthy.
p283
aVIf airports can become shopping malls
p284
aVand McDonald's can become playgrounds,
p285
aVsurely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd that's what Health Leads has tried to do,
p288
aVto reclaim that real estate and that time
p289
aVand to use it as a gateway
p290
aVto connect patients
p291
aVto the resources they need to be healthy.
p292
aVSo it's a brutal winter in the Northeast,
p293
aVyour kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off,
p294
aVand of course you're in the waiting room of the ER,
p295
aVbecause the cold air triggered your child's asthma.
p296
aVBut what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously,
p297
aVthe waiting room became the place
p298
aVwhere Health Leads turned your heat back on?
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd of course all of this requires
p301
aVa broader workforce.
p302
aVBut if we're creative, we already have that too.
p303
aVWe know that our doctors and nurses
p304
aVand even social workers
p305
aVaren't enough,
p306
aVthat the ticking minutes of health care
p307
aVare too constraining.
p308
aVHealth just takes more time.
p309
aVIt requires a non-clinical army
p310
aVof community health workers and case managers
p311
aVand many others.
p312
aa(lp313
VWhat if a small part of that next healthcare workforce
p314
aVwere the 11 million college students in this country?
p315
aVUnencumbered by clinical responsibilities,
p316
aVunwilling to take no for an answer
p317
aVfrom those bureaucracies
p318
aVthat tend to crush patients,
p319
aVand with an unparalleled ability
p320
aVfor information retrieval
p321
aVhoned through years of using Google.
p322
aa(lp323
VNow lest you think it improbable
p324
aVthat a college volunteer
p325
aVcan make this kind of commitment,
p326
aVI have two words for you:
p327
aVMarch Madness.
p328
aVThe average NCAA Division I men's basketball player
p329
aVdedicates 39 hours a week to his sport.
p330
aVNow we may think that's good or bad,
p331
aVbut in either case it's real.
p332
aVAnd Health Leads is based on the presumption
p333
aVthat for too long
p334
aVwe have asked too little of our college students
p335
aVwhen it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities.
p336
aVCollege sports teams say,
p337
aV"We're going to take dozens of hours
p338
aVat some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning
p339
aVand we're going to measure your performance, and your team's performance,
p340
aVand if you don't measure up or you don't show up,
p341
aVwe're going to cut you off the team.
p342
aVBut we'll make huge investments
p343
aVin your training and development,
p344
aVand we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers."
p345
aVAnd people line up out the door
p346
aVjust for the chance to be part of it.
p347
aa(lp348
VSo our feeling is,
p349
aVif it's good enough for the rugby team,
p350
aVit's good enough for health and poverty.
p351
aVHealth Leads too recruits competitively,
p352
aVtrains intensively,
p353
aVcoaches professionally,
p354
aVdemands significant time,
p355
aVbuilds a cohesive team
p356
aVand measures results \u2014
p357
aVa kind of Teach for America for healthcare.
p358
aa(lp359
VNow in the top 10 cities in the U.S.
p360
aVwith the largest number of Medicaid patients,
p361
aVeach of those has at least 20,000 college students.
p362
aVNew York alone has half a million college students.
p363
aVAnd this isn't just a sort of short-term workforce
p364
aVto connect patients to basic resources,
p365
aVit's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline
p366
aVwho've spent two, three, four years
p367
aVin the clinic waiting room
p368
aVtalking to patients about their most basic health needs.
p369
aVAnd they leave with the conviction,
p370
aVthe ability and the efficacy
p371
aVto realize our most basic aspirations for health care.
p372
aVAnd the thing is, there's thousands of these folks already out there.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine
p375
aVat UCSF Medical Center,
p376
aVbut for three years as an undergraduate
p377
aVshe was a Health Leads volunteer
p378
aVin the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center.
p379
aVMia says, "When my classmates write a prescription,
p380
aVthey think their work is done.
p381
aVWhen I write a prescription,
p382
aVI think, can the family read the prescription?
p383
aVDo they have transportation to the pharmacy?
p384
aVDo they have food to take with the prescription?
p385
aVDo they have insurance to fill the prescription?
p386
aVThose are the questions I learned at Health Leads,
p387
aVnot in medical school."
p388
aa(lp389
VNow none of these solutions \u2014
p390
aVthe prescription pad, the electronic medical record,
p391
aVthe waiting room,
p392
aVthe army of college students \u2014
p393
aVare perfect.
p394
aVBut they are ours for the taking \u2014
p395
aVsimple examples
p396
aVof the vast under-utilized healthcare resources
p397
aVthat, if we reclaimed and redeployed,
p398
aVcould realize our most basic aspiration
p399
aVof healthcare.
p400
aa(lp401
VSo I had been at Legal Services for about nine months
p402
aVwhen this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind.
p403
aVAnd I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell, my attorney,
p404
aVthat I needed to leave.
p405
aVAnd I was so nervous,
p406
aVbecause I thought he was going to be disappointed in me
p407
aVfor abandoning our clients for some crazy idea.
p408
aVAnd I sat down with him and I said,
p409
aV"Jeff, I have this idea
p410
aVthat we could mobilize college students
p411
aVto address patients' most basic health needs."
p412
aVAnd I'll be honest,
p413
aVall I wanted was for him to not be angry at me.
p414
aVBut he said this,
p415
aV"Rebecca, when you have a vision,
p416
aVyou have an obligation to realize that vision.
p417
aVYou must pursue that vision."
p418
aVAnd I have to say, I was like "Whoa.
p419
aVThat's a lot of pressure."
p420
aVI just wanted a blessing,
p421
aVI didn't want some kind of mandate.
p422
aVBut the truth is
p423
aVI've spent every waking minute nearly since then
p424
aVchasing that vision.
p425
aa(lp426
VI believe that we all have a vision
p427
aVfor healthcare in this country.
p428
aVI believe that at the end of the day
p429
aVwhen we measure our healthcare,
p430
aVit will not be by the diseases cured,
p431
aVbut by the diseases prevented.
p432
aVIt will not be by the excellence of our technologies
p433
aVor the sophistication of our specialists,
p434
aVbut by how rarely we needed them.
p435
aVAnd most of all,
p436
aVI believe that when we measure healthcare,
p437
aVit will be, not by what the system was,
p438
aVbut by what we chose it to be.
p439
aa(lp440
VThank you.
p441
aa(lp442

p443
aa(lp444

VThe two most likely largest inventions
p5
aVof our generation
p6
aVare the Internet and the mobile phone.
p7
aVThey've changed the world.
p8
aVHowever, largely to our surprise,
p9
aVthey also turned out to be the perfect tools
p10
aVfor the surveillance state.
p11
aVIt turned out that the capability
p12
aVto collect data, information and connections
p13
aVabout basically any of us and all of us
p14
aVis exactly what we've been hearing
p15
aVthroughout of the summer through revelations and leaks
p16
aVabout Western intelligence agencies,
p17
aVmostly U.S. intelligence agencies,
p18
aVwatching over the rest of the world.
p19
aa(lp20
VWe've heard about these starting with the
p21
aVrevelations from June 6.
p22
aVEdward Snowden started leaking information,
p23
aVtop secret classified information,
p24
aVfrom the U.S. intelligence agencies,
p25
aVand we started learning about things like PRISM
p26
aVand XKeyscore and others.
p27
aVAnd these are examples of the kinds of programs
p28
aVU.S. intelligence agencies are running right now,
p29
aVagainst the whole rest of the world.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd if you look back about the forecasts
p32
aVon surveillance by George Orwell,
p33
aVwell it turns out that
p34
aVGeorge Orwell was an optimist.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVWe are right now seeing a much larger scale
p37
aVof tracking of individual citizens
p38
aVthan he could have ever imagined.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd this here is the infamous
p41
aVNSA data center in Utah.
p42
aVDue to be opened very soon,
p43
aVit will be both a supercomputing center
p44
aVand a data storage center.
p45
aVYou could basically imagine it has a large hall
p46
aVfilled with hard drives storing data
p47
aVthey are collecting.
p48
aVAnd it's a pretty big building.
p49
aVHow big? Well, I can give you the numbers \u2014
p50
aV140,000 square meters \u2014
p51
aVbut that doesn't really tell you very much.
p52
aVMaybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.
p53
aVYou think about the largest IKEA store
p54
aVyou've ever been in.
p55
aVThis is five times larger.
p56
aVHow many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?
p57
aVRight? It's pretty big.
p58
aVWe estimate that just the electricity bill
p59
aVfor running this data center
p60
aVis going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
p61
aVAnd this kind of wholesale surveillance
p62
aVmeans that they can collect our data
p63
aVand keep it basically forever,
p64
aVkeep it for extended periods of time,
p65
aVkeep it for years, keep it for decades.
p66
aVAnd this opens up completely new kinds of risks
p67
aVto us all.
p68
aVAnd what this is is that it is wholesale
p69
aVblanket surveillance on everyone.
p70
aa(lp71
VWell, not exactly everyone,
p72
aVbecause the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right
p73
aVto monitor foreigners.
p74
aVThey can monitor foreigners
p75
aVwhen foreigners' data connections
p76
aVend up in the United States or pass through the United States.
p77
aVAnd monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad
p78
aVuntil you realize
p79
aVthat I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner.
p80
aVIn fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VRight?
p85
aa(lp86
VSo it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us,
p87
aVall of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut don't get me wrong:
p90
aVThere are actually types of surveillance that are okay.
p91
aVI love freedom, but even I agree
p92
aVthat some surveillance is fine.
p93
aVIf the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer,
p94
aVor they're trying to catch a drug lord
p95
aVor trying to prevent a school shooting,
p96
aVand they have leads and they have suspects,
p97
aVthen it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone,
p98
aVand to intercept his Internet communications.
p99
aVI'm not arguing that at all,
p100
aVbut that's not what programs like PRISM are about.
p101
aVThey are not about doing surveillance on people
p102
aVthat they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings.
p103
aVThey're about doing surveillance on people
p104
aVthey know are innocent.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo the four main arguments
p107
aVsupporting surveillance like this,
p108
aVwell, the first of all is that whenever you start
p109
aVdiscussing about these revelations,
p110
aVthere will be naysayers trying to minimize
p111
aVthe importance of these revelations, saying that
p112
aVwe knew all this already,
p113
aVwe knew it was happening, there's nothing new here.
p114
aVAnd that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you
p115
aVthat we knew this already, because we did not know this already.
p116
aVOur worst fears might have been something like this,
p117
aVbut we didn't know this was happening.
p118
aVNow we know for a fact it's happening.
p119
aVWe didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM.
p120
aVWe didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans.
p121
aVWe didn't know about DoubleArrow.
p122
aVWe did not know about Skywriter \u2014
p123
aVall these different programs
p124
aVrun by U.S. intelligence agencies.
p125
aVBut now we do.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd we did not know
p128
aVthat U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes
p129
aVsuch as infiltrating standardization bodies
p130
aVto sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.
p131
aVAnd what that means
p132
aVis that you take something which is secure,
p133
aVan encryption algorithm which is so secure
p134
aVthat if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,
p135
aVnobody can decrypt that file.
p136
aVEven if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,
p137
aVit's going to take millions of years.
p138
aVSo that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.
p139
aVYou take something which is that good
p140
aVand then you weaken it on purpose,
p141
aVmaking all of us less secure as an end result.
p142
aVA real-world equivalent would be that
p143
aVintelligence agencies would force
p144
aVsome secret pin code into every single house alarm
p145
aVso they could get into every single house
p146
aVbecause, you know, bad people might have house alarms,
p147
aVbut it will also make all of us
p148
aVless secure as an end result.
p149
aVBackdooring encryption algorithms
p150
aVjust boggles the mind.
p151
aVBut of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job.
p152
aVThis is what they have been told to do:
p153
aVdo signals intelligence,
p154
aVmonitor telecommunications,
p155
aVmonitor Internet traffic.
p156
aVThat's what they're trying to do,
p157
aVand since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted,
p158
aVthey're trying to find ways around the encryption.
p159
aVOne way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,
p160
aVwhich is a great example
p161
aVabout how U.S. intelligence agencies
p162
aVare running loose.
p163
aVThey are completely out of control,
p164
aVand they should be brought back under control.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo what do we actually know about the leaks?
p167
aVEverything is based on the files
p168
aVleaked by Mr. Snowden.
p169
aVThe very first PRISM slides
p170
aVfrom the beginning of June
p171
aVdetail a collection program where the data
p172
aVis collected from service providers,
p173
aVand they actually go and name the service providers
p174
aVthey have access to.
p175
aVThey even have a specific date
p176
aVon when the collection of data began
p177
aVfor each of the service providers.
p178
aVSo for example, they name the collection from Microsoft
p179
aVstarted on September 11, 2007,
p180
aVfor Yahoo on the March 12, 2008,
p181
aVand then others: Google, Facebook,
p182
aVSkype, Apple and so on.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd every single one of these companies denies.
p185
aVThey all say that this simply isn't true,
p186
aVthat they are not giving backdoor access to their data.
p187
aVYet we have these files.
p188
aVSo is one of the parties lying,
p189
aVor is there some other alternative explanation?
p190
aVAnd one explanation would be
p191
aVthat these parties, these service providers,
p192
aVare not cooperating.
p193
aVInstead, they've been hacked.
p194
aVThat would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.
p195
aVIn this case, they've been hacked by their own government.
p196
aVThat might sound outlandish,
p197
aVbut we already have cases where this has happened,
p198
aVfor example, the case of the Flame malware
p199
aVwhich we strongly believe was authored
p200
aVby the U.S. government,
p201
aVand which, to spread, subverted the security
p202
aVof the Windows Update network,
p203
aVmeaning here, the company was hacked
p204
aVby their own government.
p205
aVAnd there's more evidence
p206
aVsupporting this theory as well.
p207
aVDer Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information
p208
aVabout the operations run by the elite hacker units
p209
aVoperating inside these intelligence agencies.
p210
aVInside NSA, the unit is called TAO,
p211
aVTailored Access Operations,
p212
aVand inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent,
p213
aVit's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.
p214
aVAnd these recent leaks of these three slides
p215
aVdetail an operation
p216
aVrun by this GCHQ intelligence agency
p217
aVfrom the United Kingdom
p218
aVtargeting a telecom here in Belgium.
p219
aVAnd what this really means
p220
aVis that an E.U. country's intelligence agency
p221
aVis breaching the security
p222
aVof a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose,
p223
aVand they discuss it in their slides completely casually,
p224
aVbusiness as usual.
p225
aVHere's the primary target,
p226
aVhere's the secondary target,
p227
aVhere's the teaming.
p228
aVThey probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub.
p229
aVThey even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art
p230
aVlike, you know, "Success,"
p231
aVwhen they gain access to services like this.
p232
aVWhat the hell?
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd then there's the argument
p235
aVthat okay, yes, this might be going on,
p236
aVbut then again, other countries are doing it as well.
p237
aVAll countries spy.
p238
aVAnd maybe that's true.
p239
aVMany countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example.
p240
aVLet's take, for example, Sweden.
p241
aVI'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden
p242
aVhas a little bit of a similar law to the United States.
p243
aVWhen your data traffic goes through Sweden,
p244
aVtheir intelligence agency has a legal right by the law
p245
aVto intercept that traffic.
p246
aVAll right, how many Swedish decisionmakers
p247
aVand politicians and business leaders
p248
aVuse, every day, U.S.-based services,
p249
aVlike, you know, run Windows or OSX,
p250
aVor use Facebook or LinkedIn,
p251
aVor store their data in clouds like iCloud
p252
aVor Skydrive or DropBox,
p253
aVor maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support?
p254
aVAnd the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day.
p255
aVAnd then we turn it around.
p256
aVHow many American leaders
p257
aVuse Swedish webmails and cloud services?
p258
aVAnd the answer is zero.
p259
aVSo this is not balanced.
p260
aVIt's not balanced by any means, not even close.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd when we do have the occasional
p263
aVEuropean success story,
p264
aVeven those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States.
p265
aVLike, Skype used to be secure.
p266
aVIt used to be end-to-end encrypted.
p267
aVThen it was sold to the United States.
p268
aVToday, it no longer is secure.
p269
aVSo once again, we take something which is secure
p270
aVand then we make it less secure on purpose,
p271
aVmaking all of us less secure as an outcome.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd then the argument that the United States
p274
aVis only fighting terrorists.
p275
aVIt's the war on terror.
p276
aVYou shouldn't worry about it.
p277
aVWell, it's not the war on terror.
p278
aVYes, part of it is war on terror, and yes,
p279
aVthere are terrorists, and they do kill and maim,
p280
aVand we should fight them,
p281
aVbut we know through these leaks
p282
aVthat they have used the same techniques
p283
aVto listen to phone calls of European leaders,
p284
aVto tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil,
p285
aVto read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,
p286
aVand I don't think they are trying to find terrorists
p287
aVfrom inside the E.U. Parliament, right?
p288
aVIt's not the war on terror.
p289
aVPart of it might be, and there are terrorists,
p290
aVbut are we really thinking about terrorists
p291
aVas such an existential threat
p292
aVthat we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?
p293
aVAre the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion
p294
aVand throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists?
p295
aVAnd the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments
p296
aVand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
p297
aVand the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms
p298
aVand the press freedom?
p299
aVDo we really think terrorism is such an existential threat,
p300
aVwe are ready to do anything at all?
p301
aa(lp302
VBut people are scared about terrorists,
p303
aVand then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay
p304
aVbecause they have nothing to hide.
p305
aVFeel free to survey me if that helps.
p306
aVAnd whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide
p307
aVsimply hasn't thought about this long enough.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Applause)
p310
aa(lp311
VBecause we have this thing called privacy,
p312
aVand if you really think that you have nothing to hide,
p313
aVplease make sure that's the first thing you tell me,
p314
aVbecause then I know
p315
aVthat I should not trust you with any secrets,
p316
aVbecause obviously you can't keep a secret.
p317
aVBut people are brutally honest with the Internet,
p318
aVand when these leaks started,
p319
aVmany people were asking me about this.
p320
aVAnd I have nothing to hide.
p321
aVI'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.
p322
aVYet, I have nothing that I would in particular
p323
aVlike to share with an intelligence agency,
p324
aVespecially a foreign intelligence agency.
p325
aVAnd if we indeed need a Big Brother,
p326
aVI would much rather have a domestic Big Brother
p327
aVthan a foreign Big Brother.
p328
aVAnd when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this
p329
aVwas a comment about how,
p330
aVwhen you've been using search engines,
p331
aVyou've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence.
p332
aVAnd two minutes later, I got a reply
p333
aVby somebody called Kimberly from the United States
p334
aVchallenging me, like, why am I worried about this?
p335
aVWhat am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something?
p336
aVAnd my answer to Kimberly was
p337
aVthat what I'm sending is none of your business,
p338
aVand it should be none of your government's business either.
p339
aVBecause that's what it's about. It's about privacy.
p340
aVPrivacy is nonnegotiable.
p341
aVIt should be built in to all the systems we use.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd one thing we should all understand
p346
aVis that we are brutally honest with search engines.
p347
aVYou show me your search history,
p348
aVand I'll find something incriminating
p349
aVor something embarrassing there in five minutes.
p350
aVWe are more honest with search engines
p351
aVthan we are with our families.
p352
aVSearch engines know more about you
p353
aVthan your family members know about you.
p354
aVAnd this is all the kind of information we are giving away,
p355
aVwe are giving away to the United States.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd surveillance changes history.
p358
aVWe know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon.
p359
aVImagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today.
p360
aVAnd let me actually quote
p361
aVthe president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff.
p362
aVShe was one of the targets of NSA surveillance.
p363
aVHer email was read, and she spoke
p364
aVat the United Nations Headquarters, and she said,
p365
aV"If there is no right to privacy,
p366
aVthere can be no true freedom of expression and opinion,
p367
aVand therefore, there can be no effective democracy."
p368
aa(lp369
VThat's what it's about.
p370
aVPrivacy is the building block of our democracies.
p371
aVAnd to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum,
p372
aVhe said that the United States is right now treating the Internet
p373
aVas it would be treating one of its colonies.
p374
aVSo we are back to the age of colonization,
p375
aVand we, the foreign users of the Internet,
p376
aVwe should think about Americans as our masters.
p377
aa(lp378
VSo Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.
p379
aVSome are blaming him for causing problems
p380
aVfor the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations \u2014
p381
aVand blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry
p382
aVwould be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore
p383
aVfor causing global warming.
p384
aa(lp385
V(Laughter)
p386
aa(lp387
V(Applause)
p388
aa(lp389
VSo, what is there to be done?
p390
aVShould we worry. No, we shouldn't worry.
p391
aVWe should be angry, because this is wrong,
p392
aVand it's rude, and it should not be done.
p393
aVBut that's not going to really change the situation.
p394
aVWhat's going to change the situation for the rest of the world
p395
aVis to try to steer away
p396
aVfrom systems built in the United States.
p397
aVAnd that's much easier said than done.
p398
aVHow do you do that?
p399
aVA single country, any single country in Europe
p400
aVcannot replace and build replacements
p401
aVfor the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services.
p402
aa(lp403
VBut maybe you don't have to do it alone.
p404
aVMaybe you can do it together with other countries.
p405
aVThe solution is open source.
p406
aVBy building together open, free, secure systems,
p407
aVwe can go around such surveillance,
p408
aVand then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself.
p409
aVIt only has to solve one little problem.
p410
aVAnd to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer,
p411
aVone country only has to make a small wave,
p412
aVbut those small waves together become a tide,
p413
aVand the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time,
p414
aVand the tide we will build
p415
aVwith secure, free, open-source systems,
p416
aVwill become the tide that will lift all of us
p417
aVup and above the surveillance state.
p418
aa(lp419
VThank you very much.

VI love video games.
p5
aVI'm also slightly in awe of them.
p6
aVI'm in awe of their power
p7
aVin terms of imagination, in terms of technology,
p8
aVin terms of concept.
p9
aVBut I think, above all,
p10
aVI'm in awe at their power
p11
aVto motivate, to compel us,
p12
aVto transfix us,
p13
aVlike really nothing else we've ever invented
p14
aVhas quite done before.
p15
aVAnd I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things
p16
aVby looking at how we do this.
p17
aVAnd in particular, I think we can learn things
p18
aVabout learning.
p19
aVNow the video games industry
p20
aVis far and away the fastest growing
p21
aVof all modern media.
p22
aVFrom about 10 billion in 1990,
p23
aVit's worth 50 billion dollars globally today,
p24
aVand it shows no sign of slowing down.
p25
aVIn four years' time,
p26
aVit's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars.
p27
aVThat's about three times the recorded music industry.
p28
aVThis is pretty stunning,
p29
aVbut I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all.
p30
aVThe thing that really amazes me
p31
aVis that, today,
p32
aVpeople spend about
p33
aVeight billion real dollars a year
p34
aVbuying virtual items
p35
aVthat only exist
p36
aVinside video games.
p37
aVThis is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe.
p38
aVEarlier this year,
p39
aVa virtual asteroid in it
p40
aVsold for 330,000 real dollars.
p41
aVAnd this
p42
aVis a Titan class ship
p43
aVin the space game, EVE Online.
p44
aVAnd this virtual object
p45
aVtakes 200 real people
p46
aVabout 56 days of real time to build,
p47
aVplus countless thousands of hours
p48
aVof effort before that.
p49
aVAnd yet, many of these get built.
p50
aVAt the other end of the scale,
p51
aVthe game Farmville that you may well have heard of,
p52
aVhas 70 million players
p53
aVaround the world
p54
aVand most of these players
p55
aVare playing it almost every day.
p56
aa(lp57
VThis may all sound
p58
aVreally quite alarming to some people,
p59
aVan index of something worrying
p60
aVor wrong in society.
p61
aVBut we're here for the good news,
p62
aVand the good news is
p63
aVthat I think we can explore
p64
aVwhy this very real human effort,
p65
aVthis very intense generation of value, is occurring.
p66
aVAnd by answering that question,
p67
aVI think we can take something
p68
aVextremely powerful away.
p69
aVAnd I think the most interesting way
p70
aVto think about how all this is going on
p71
aVis in terms of rewards.
p72
aVAnd specifically, it's in terms
p73
aVof the very intense emotional rewards
p74
aVthat playing games offers to people
p75
aVboth individually
p76
aVand collectively.
p77
aVNow if we look at what's going on in someone's head
p78
aVwhen they are being engaged,
p79
aVtwo quite different processes are occurring.
p80
aVOn the one hand, there's the wanting processes.
p81
aVThis is a bit like ambition and drive \u2014 I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard.
p82
aVOn the other hand, there's the liking processes,
p83
aVfun and affection
p84
aVand delight
p85
aVand an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back.
p86
aVIt's a really great image. It's pretty cool.
p87
aVIt's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally,
p88
aVone of whom is me, another of whom is my wife.
p89
aVAnd this kind of a world,
p90
aVthis vast flying beast you can ride around,
p91
aVshows why games are so very good
p92
aVat doing both the wanting and the liking.
p93
aVBecause it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome.
p94
aVIt gives you great powers.
p95
aVYour ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful.
p96
aVIt's a very great pleasure to fly around.
p97
aVAnd so these combine to form
p98
aVa very intense emotional engagement.
p99
aa(lp100
VBut this isn't the really interesting stuff.
p101
aVThe really interesting stuff about virtuality
p102
aVis what you can measure with it.
p103
aVBecause what you can measure in virtuality
p104
aVis everything.
p105
aVEvery single thing that every single person
p106
aVwho's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured.
p107
aVThe biggest games in the world today
p108
aVare measuring more than one billion points of data
p109
aVabout their players, about what everybody does \u2014
p110
aVfar more detail than you'd ever get from any website.
p111
aVAnd this allows something very special
p112
aVto happen in games.
p113
aVIt's something called the reward schedule.
p114
aVAnd by this, I mean looking
p115
aVat what millions upon millions of people have done
p116
aVand carefully calibrating the rate,
p117
aVthe nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games
p118
aVto keep them engaged
p119
aVover staggering amounts of time and effort.
p120
aVNow, to try and explain this
p121
aVin sort of real terms,
p122
aVI want to talk about a kind of task
p123
aVthat might fall to you in so many games.
p124
aVGo and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item.
p125
aVLet's say, for the sake of argument,
p126
aVmy mission is to get 15 pies
p127
aVand I can get 15 pies
p128
aVby killing these cute, little monsters.
p129
aVSimple game quest.
p130
aVNow you can think about this, if you like,
p131
aVas a problem about boxes.
p132
aVI've got to keep opening boxes.
p133
aVI don't know what's inside them until I open them.
p134
aVAnd I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies.
p135
aVNow, if you take a game like Warcraft,
p136
aVyou can think about it, if you like,
p137
aVas a great box-opening effort.
p138
aVThe game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes,
p139
aVgetting better and better stuff in them.
p140
aa(lp141
VThis sounds immensely boring
p142
aVbut games are able
p143
aVto make this process
p144
aVincredibly compelling.
p145
aVAnd the way they do this
p146
aVis through a combination of probability and data.
p147
aVLet's think about probability.
p148
aVIf we want to engage someone
p149
aVin the process of opening boxes to try and find pies,
p150
aVwe want to make sure it's neither too easy,
p151
aVnor too difficult, to find a pie.
p152
aVSo what do you do? Well, you look at a million people \u2014
p153
aVno, 100 million people, 100 million box openers \u2014
p154
aVand you work out, if you make the pie rate
p155
aVabout 25 percent \u2014
p156
aVthat's neither too frustrating, nor too easy.
p157
aVIt keeps people engaged.
p158
aVBut of course, that's not all you do \u2014 there's 15 pies.
p159
aVNow, I could make a game called Piecraft,
p160
aVwhere all you had to do was get a million pies
p161
aVor a thousand pies.
p162
aVThat would be very boring.
p163
aVFifteen is a pretty optimal number.
p164
aVYou find that \u2014 you know, between five and 20
p165
aVis about the right number for keeping people going.
p166
aVBut we don't just have pies in the boxes.
p167
aVThere's 100 percent up here.
p168
aVAnd what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened,
p169
aVthere's something in it, some little reward
p170
aVthat keeps people progressing and engaged.
p171
aVIn most adventure games,
p172
aVit's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience.
p173
aVBut we don't just do that either.
p174
aa(lp175
VWe also say there's going to be loads of other items
p176
aVof varying qualities and levels of excitement.
p177
aVThere's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item.
p178
aVThere's going to be a 0.1 percent chance
p179
aVyou get an absolutely awesome item.
p180
aVAnd each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item.
p181
aVAnd also, we say,
p182
aV"Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?"
p183
aVNo, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time.
p184
aVSo I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult.
p185
aVSo all this is very powerful.
p186
aVBut we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes.
p187
aVSo we can do
p188
aVsome rather amazing things.
p189
aVWe notice, looking at all these people opening boxes,
p190
aVthat when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies,
p191
aVtheir perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy.
p192
aVThey're not rational about probability.
p193
aVThey think this game is unfair.
p194
aVIt's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up.
p195
aVIf they're real boxes, there's not much we can do,
p196
aVbut in a game we can just say, "Right, well.
p197
aVWhen you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now."
p198
aVKeep you engaged. Look at what people do \u2014
p199
aVadjust the world to match their expectation.
p200
aVOur games don't always do this.
p201
aVAnd one thing they certainly do at the moment
p202
aVis if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item,
p203
aVthey make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time
p204
aVto keep the value, to keep it special.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd the point is really
p207
aVthat we evolved to be satisfied by the world
p208
aVin particular ways.
p209
aVOver tens and hundreds of thousands of years,
p210
aVwe evolved to find certain things stimulating,
p211
aVand as very intelligent, civilized beings,
p212
aVwe're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning.
p213
aVBut now, we can reverse engineer that
p214
aVand build worlds
p215
aVthat expressly tick our evolutionary boxes.
p216
aVSo what does all this mean in practice?
p217
aVWell, I've come up
p218
aVwith seven things
p219
aVthat, I think, show
p220
aVhow you can take these lessons from games
p221
aVand use them outside of games.
p222
aVThe first one is very simple:
p223
aVexperience bars measuring progress \u2014
p224
aVsomething that's been talked about brilliantly
p225
aVby people like Jesse Schell earlier this year.
p226
aVIt's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places.
p227
aVIt's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally
p228
aVin little bits and pieces,
p229
aVyou give them one profile character avatar
p230
aVwhich is constantly progressing
p231
aVin tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own.
p232
aVAnd everything comes towards that,
p233
aVand they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along.
p234
aa(lp235
VSecond, multiple long and short-term aims \u2014
p236
aV5,000 pies, boring,
p237
aV15 pies, interesting.
p238
aVSo, you give people
p239
aVlots and lots of different tasks.
p240
aVYou say, it's about
p241
aVdoing 10 of these questions,
p242
aVbut another task
p243
aVis turning up to 20 classes on time,
p244
aVbut another task is collaborating with other people,
p245
aVanother task is showing you're working five times,
p246
aVanother task is hitting this particular target.
p247
aVYou break things down into these calibrated slices
p248
aVthat people can choose and do in parallel
p249
aVto keep them engaged
p250
aVand that you can use to point them
p251
aVtowards individually beneficial activities.
p252
aa(lp253
VThird, you reward effort.
p254
aVIt's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this.
p255
aVEvery time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying.
p256
aVYou don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort \u2014
p257
aVa little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions \u2014 tick.
p258
aVIt all feeds in as minute reinforcement.
p259
aa(lp260
VFourth, feedback.
p261
aVThis is absolutely crucial,
p262
aVand virtuality is dazzling at delivering this.
p263
aVIf you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today
p264
aVthat we've been hearing amazing things about,
p265
aVit's very, very hard for people to learn
p266
aVif they cannot link consequences to actions.
p267
aVPollution, global warming, these things \u2014
p268
aVthe consequences are distant in time and space.
p269
aVIt's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson.
p270
aVBut if you can model things for people,
p271
aVif you can give things to people that they can manipulate
p272
aVand play with and where the feedback comes,
p273
aVthen they can learn a lesson, they can see,
p274
aVthey can move on, they can understand.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd fifth,
p277
aVthe element of uncertainty.
p278
aVNow this is the neurological goldmine,
p279
aVif you like,
p280
aVbecause a known reward
p281
aVexcites people,
p282
aVbut what really gets them going
p283
aVis the uncertain reward,
p284
aVthe reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty,
p285
aVthat they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not.
p286
aVThe 25 percent. This lights the brain up.
p287
aVAnd if you think about
p288
aVusing this in testing,
p289
aVin just introducing control elements of randomness
p290
aVin all forms of testing and training,
p291
aVyou can transform the levels of people's engagement
p292
aVby tapping into this very powerful
p293
aVevolutionary mechanism.
p294
aVWhen we don't quite predict something perfectly,
p295
aVwe get really excited about it.
p296
aVWe just want to go back and find out more.
p297
aa(lp298
VAs you probably know, the neurotransmitter
p299
aVassociated with learning is called dopamine.
p300
aVIt's associated with reward-seeking behavior.
p301
aVAnd something very exciting is just beginning to happen
p302
aVin places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.,
p303
aVwhere we are beginning to be able to model mathematically
p304
aVdopamine levels in the brain.
p305
aVAnd what this means is we can predict learning,
p306
aVwe can predict enhanced engagement,
p307
aVthese windows, these windows of time,
p308
aVin which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level.
p309
aVAnd two things really flow from this.
p310
aVThe first has to do with memory,
p311
aVthat we can find these moments.
p312
aVWhen someone is more likely to remember,
p313
aVwe can give them a nugget in a window.
p314
aVAnd the second thing is confidence,
p315
aVthat we can see how game-playing and reward structures
p316
aVmake people braver, make them more willing to take risks,
p317
aVmore willing to take on difficulty,
p318
aVharder to discourage.
p319
aVThis can all seem very sinister.
p320
aVBut you know, sort of "our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts."
p321
aVThe word "addiction" is thrown around.
p322
aVThere are real concerns there.
p323
aVBut the biggest neurological turn-on for people
p324
aVis other people.
p325
aVThis is what really excites us.
p326
aVIn reward terms, it's not money;
p327
aVit's not being given cash \u2014 that's nice \u2014
p328
aVit's doing stuff with our peers,
p329
aVwatching us, collaborating with us.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 \u2014
p332
aVa video game called EverQuest.
p333
aVAnd in this video game,
p334
aVthere were two really big dragons, and you had to team up to kill them \u2014
p335
aV42 people, up to 42 to kill these big dragons.
p336
aVThat's a problem
p337
aVbecause they dropped two or three decent items.
p338
aVSo players addressed this problem
p339
aVby spontaneously coming up with a system
p340
aVto motivate each other,
p341
aVfairly and transparently.
p342
aVWhat happened was, they paid each other a virtual currency
p343
aVthey called "dragon kill points."
p344
aVAnd every time you turned up to go on a mission,
p345
aVyou got paid in dragon kill points.
p346
aVThey tracked these on a separate website.
p347
aVSo they tracked their own private currency,
p348
aVand then players could bid afterwards
p349
aVfor cool items they wanted \u2014
p350
aVall organized by the players themselves.
p351
aVNow the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest,
p352
aVbut that today, a decade on,
p353
aVevery single video game in the world with this kind of task
p354
aVuses a version of this system \u2014
p355
aVtens of millions of people.
p356
aVAnd the success rate
p357
aVis at close to 100 percent.
p358
aVThis is a player-developed,
p359
aVself-enforcing, voluntary currency,
p360
aVand it's incredibly sophisticated
p361
aVplayer behavior.
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd I just want to end by suggesting
p364
aVa few ways in which these principles
p365
aVcould fan out into the world.
p366
aVLet's start with business.
p367
aVI mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems
p368
aVaround something like business are
p369
aVrecycling and energy conservation.
p370
aVWe're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies
p371
aVlike real-time energy meters.
p372
aVAnd I just look at this, and I think, yes,
p373
aVwe could take that so much further
p374
aVby allowing people to set targets
p375
aVby setting calibrated targets,
p376
aVby using elements of uncertainty,
p377
aVby using these multiple targets,
p378
aVby using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system,
p379
aVby setting people up
p380
aVto collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets
p381
aVto collaborate and compete,
p382
aVto use these very sophisticated
p383
aVgroup and motivational mechanics we see.
p384
aVIn terms of education,
p385
aVperhaps most obviously of all,
p386
aVwe can transform how we engage people.
p387
aVWe can offer people the grand continuity
p388
aVof experience and personal investment.
p389
aVWe can break things down
p390
aVinto highly calibrated small tasks.
p391
aVWe can use calculated randomness.
p392
aVWe can reward effort consistently
p393
aVas everything fields together.
p394
aVAnd we can use the kind of group behaviors
p395
aVthat we see evolving when people are at play together,
p396
aVthese really quite unprecedentedly complex
p397
aVcooperative mechanisms.
p398
aVGovernment, well, one thing that comes to mind
p399
aVis the U.S. government, among others,
p400
aVis literally starting to pay people
p401
aVto lose weight.
p402
aVSo we're seeing financial reward being used
p403
aVto tackle the great issue of obesity.
p404
aVBut again, those rewards
p405
aVcould be calibrated so precisely
p406
aVif we were able to use the vast expertise
p407
aVof gaming systems to just jack up that appeal,
p408
aVto take the data, to take the observations,
p409
aVof millions of human hours
p410
aVand plow that feedback
p411
aVinto increasing engagement.
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd in the end, it's this word, "engagement,"
p414
aVthat I want to leave you with.
p415
aVIt's about how individual engagement
p416
aVcan be transformed
p417
aVby the psychological and the neurological lessons
p418
aVwe can learn from watching people that are playing games.
p419
aVBut it's also about collective engagement
p420
aVand about the unprecedented laboratory
p421
aVfor observing what makes people tick
p422
aVand work and play and engage
p423
aVon a grand scale in games.
p424
aVAnd if we can look at these things and learn from them
p425
aVand see how to turn them outwards,
p426
aVthen I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands.
p427
aa(lp428

But gaming is not only outstripping more-traditional media in revenue (it overtook music in 2008), it&#39;s become a powerful lens to re-examine our culture at large. Tom Chatfield, a longtime gamer, is the arts and books editor at the UK current-affairs magazine <em>Prospect</em>. In his book <em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/funinc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Fun Inc.</a>,</em>&nbsp;he argues that games, with their immersive quests and deeply satisfying (and carefully designed) virtual rewards, are a great place to test new approaches to real-world systems that need a reboot. </p><p>More than a game journalist, Chatfield is a game theorist, looking at neurological research on how games engage our pleasure centers -- and then looking at a world where millions of videogame-veteran Generation Z&#39;ers are entering the workforce and the voters&#39; rolls. They&#39;re good with complex rule sets; they&#39;re used to forming ad hoc groups to reach a goal; and they love to tweak and mod existing systems.

VI bring to you
p5
aVa message from
p6
aVtens of thousands of people \u2014
p7
aVin the villages, in the slums,
p8
aVin the hinterland of the country \u2014
p9
aVwho have solved problems
p10
aVthrough their own genius,
p11
aVwithout any
p12
aVoutside help.
p13
aVWhen our home minister announces
p14
aVa few weeks ago
p15
aVa war on
p16
aVone third of India,
p17
aVabout 200 districts that he mentioned
p18
aVwere ungovernable,
p19
aVhe missed the point.
p20
aVThe point that we have been stressing
p21
aVfor the last 21 years,
p22
aVthe point that
p23
aVpeople may be economically poor,
p24
aVbut they're not poor in the mind.
p25
aVIn other words,
p26
aVthe minds on the margin
p27
aVare not the marginal minds.
p28
aVThat is the message,
p29
aVwhich we started 31 years ago.
p30
aVAnd what did it start?
p31
aa(lp32
VLet me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey,
p33
aVwhich led me to come to this point.
p34
aVIn '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh
p35
aVadvising the government and the research council there
p36
aVhow to help scientists work on the lands,
p37
aVon the fields of the poor people,
p38
aVand how to develop research technologies,
p39
aVwhich are based on the knowledge of the people.
p40
aVI came back in '86.
p41
aVI had been tremendously invigorated
p42
aVby the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country,
p43
aVwhich had 60 percent landlessness
p44
aVbut amazing creativity.
p45
aVI started looking at my own work:
p46
aVThe work that I had done
p47
aVfor the previous 10 years,
p48
aValmost every time,
p49
aVhad instances of knowledge
p50
aVthat people had shared.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, I was paid in dollars as a consultant,
p53
aVand I looked at my income tax return
p54
aVand tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return,
p55
aVwhich shows how much of this income has gone
p56
aVto the people whose knowledge
p57
aVhas made it possible?
p58
aVWas it because I'm brilliant
p59
aVthat I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?
p60
aVIs it that I write very well?
p61
aVIs it that I articulate very well?
p62
aVIs it that I analyze the data very well?
p63
aVIs it because I'm a professor, and, therefore,
p64
aVI must be entitled to this reward from society?"
p65
aVI tried to convince myself that, "No, no,
p66
aVI have worked for the policy changes.
p67
aVYou know, the public policy will become
p68
aVmore responsive to the needs of the poor,
p69
aVand, therefore I think it's okay."
p70
aVBut it appeared to me
p71
aVthat all these years that I'd been working on exploitation \u2014
p72
aVexploitation by landlords,
p73
aVby moneylenders, by traders \u2014
p74
aVgave me an insight that
p75
aVprobably I was also an exploiter,
p76
aVbecause there was no line in my income tax return
p77
aVwhich showed this income accrued
p78
aVbecause of the brilliance of the people \u2014
p79
aVthose people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me \u2014
p80
aVand nothing ever went back to them.
p81
aVSo much so, that much of my work till that time
p82
aVwas in the English language.
p83
aa(lp84
VThe majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.
p85
aVSo what kind of a contributor was I?
p86
aVI was talking about social justice,
p87
aVand here I was, a professional
p88
aVwho was pursuing the most unjust act \u2014
p89
aVof taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous,
p90
aVgetting rent from that knowledge
p91
aVby sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and
p92
aVpublishing them in the papers,
p93
aVgetting invited to the conferences,
p94
aVgetting consultancies and whatever have you.
p95
aVSo then, a dilemma rose in the mind that,
p96
aVif I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right;
p97
aVlife cannot go on like that.
p98
aVAnd this was a moment of great pain and trauma
p99
aVbecause I couldn't live with it any longer.
p100
aVSo I did a review of
p101
aVethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research,
p102
aVwrote, read about 100 papers.
p103
aVAnd I came to the conclusion that
p104
aVwhile dilemma is unique,
p105
aVdilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd one day \u2014 I don't know what happened \u2014
p108
aVwhile coming back from the office towards home,
p109
aVmaybe I saw a honey bee
p110
aVor it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee,
p111
aVlife would be wonderful.
p112
aVWhat the honey bee does: it pollinates,
p113
aVtakes nectar from the flower,
p114
aVpollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
p115
aVAnd when it takes the nectar,
p116
aVthe flowers don't feel shortchanged.
p117
aVIn fact, they invite the honey bees
p118
aVthrough their colors,
p119
aVand the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.
p120
aVThese are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network:
p121
aVthat whenever we learn something from people
p122
aVit must be shared with them in their language.
p123
aVThey must not remain anonymous.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd I must tell you that after 20 years,
p126
aVI have not made one percent of change
p127
aVin the professional practice of this art.
p128
aVThat is a great tragedy \u2014 which I'm carrying still with me
p129
aVand I hope that all of you will carry this with you \u2014
p130
aVthat the profession still legitimizes publication
p131
aVof knowledge of people without attributing them
p132
aVby making them anonymous.
p133
aVThe research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences
p134
aVor Research Councils of the U.K.
p135
aVor of Indian Councils of Science Research
p136
aVdo not require
p137
aVthat whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.
p138
aVWe are talking about an accountable society,
p139
aVa society that is fair and just,
p140
aVand we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.
p141
aVAnd India wants to be a knowledge society.
p142
aVHow will it be a knowledge society?
p143
aVSo, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice,
p144
aVone for yourself and one for others.
p145
aVIt must be the same.
p146
aVYou cannot discriminate.
p147
aVYou cannot be in favor of your own values,
p148
aVwhich are at a distance from
p149
aVthe values that you espouse.
p150
aVSo, fairness to one and to the other
p151
aVis not divisible.
p152
aa(lp153
VLook at this picture.
p154
aVCan you tell me where has it been taken from,
p155
aVand what is it meant for? Anybody?
p156
aVI'm a professor; I must quiz you. (Laughter)
p157
aVAnybody? Any guess at all?
p158
aVPardon? (Audience Member: Rajasthan.)
p159
aVAnil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?
p160
aV(Murmuring)
p161
aVPardon?
p162
aVYou know, you're so right. We must give him a hand,
p163
aVbecause this man knows how insensitive our government is.
p164
aVLook at this. This is the site of the government of India.
p165
aVIt invites tourists
p166
aVto see the shame of our country.
p167
aVI'm so sorry to say that.
p168
aVIs this a beautiful picture
p169
aVor is it a terrible picture?
p170
aVIt depends upon how you look at the life of the people.
p171
aVIf this woman has to carry water on her head
p172
aVfor miles and miles and miles,
p173
aVyou cannot be celebrating that.
p174
aVWe should be doing something about it.
p175
aVAnd let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command,
p176
aVmillions of women still carry water on their heads.
p177
aVAnd we do not ask this question.
p178
aa(lp179
VYou must have taken tea in the morning.
p180
aVThink for a minute.
p181
aVThe leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes;
p182
aVyou know what the action is? The action is:
p183
aVThe lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.
p184
aVJust do it 10 times;
p185
aVyou will realize the pain in this shoulder.
p186
aVAnd she does it a few thousand times
p187
aVevery day.
p188
aVThe rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today,
p189
aVis transplanted by women
p190
aVbending in a very awkward posture,
p191
aVmillions of them,
p192
aVevery season, in the paddy season,
p193
aVwhen they transplant paddy
p194
aVwith their feet in the water.
p195
aVAnd feet in the water will develop fungus,
p196
aVinfections,
p197
aVand that infection pains
p198
aVbecause then other insects bite that point.
p199
aVAnd every year,
p200
aV99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.
p201
aVNo machines have been developed.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo the silence of scientists,
p204
aVof technologists, of public policy makers,
p205
aVof the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on;
p206
aVthis is not the way society will work.
p207
aVThis is not what our parliament would do. You know,
p208
aVwe have a program for employment:
p209
aVOne hundred, 250 million people
p210
aVhave to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.
p211
aVDoing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.
p212
aVSo we asked a question to the parliament:
p213
aVDo poor have heads?
p214
aVDo poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?
p215
aa(lp216
VSo Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.
p217
aVAnd what has happened?
p218
aVAn anonymous, faceless, nameless person
p219
aVgets in contact with the network,
p220
aVand then gets an identity.
p221
aVThis is what Honey Bee Network is about.
p222
aVAnd this network grew voluntarily,
p223
aVcontinues to be voluntary,
p224
aVand has tried to map the minds
p225
aVof millions of people
p226
aVof our country and other parts of the world who are creative.
p227
aVThey could be creative in terms of education,
p228
aVthey may be creative in terms of culture,
p229
aVthey may be creative in terms of institutions;
p230
aVbut a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity,
p231
aVthe innovations,
p232
aVeither in terms of contemporary innovations,
p233
aVor in terms of traditional knowledge.
p234
aVAnd it all begins with curiosity.
p235
aVIt all begins with curiosity.
p236
aa(lp237
VThis person, whom we met \u2014 and you will see it on the website,
p238
aVwww.sristi.org \u2014 this tribal person,
p239
aVhe had a wish.
p240
aVAnd he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" \u2014
p241
aVsomebody was sick and he had to monitor \u2014
p242
aV"God, please cure him.
p243
aVAnd if you cure him, I will get my wall painted."
p244
aVAnd this is what he got painted.
p245
aVSomebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.
p246
aVThere could be nothing more wrong than
p247
aVthe Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs
p248
aVbecause the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.
p249
aVKabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints,
p250
aVthey were all poor people,
p251
aVand they had a great reason. (Applause)
p252
aVPlease do not ever think that
p253
aVonly after meeting your physiological needs and other needs
p254
aVcan you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.
p255
aVAny person anywhere is capable
p256
aVof rising to that highest point of attainment,
p257
aVonly by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.
p258
aa(lp259
VLook at this.
p260
aVWe saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk
p261
aVin different parts of the country.
p262
aVI've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.
p263
aVSo on the wayside
p264
aVwe found these dung cakes,
p265
aVwhich are used as a fuel.
p266
aVNow, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap,
p267
aVhas made a painting.
p268
aVThat's the only space she could express her creativity.
p269
aVAnd she's so marvelous.
p270
aVLook at this lady, Ram Timari Devi,
p271
aVon a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra
p272
aVand we were walking
p273
aVin the land where Gandhiji went
p274
aVto hear about the tragedy, pain
p275
aVof indigo growers.
p276
aVBhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.
p277
aVLook at what she has done.
p278
aVThe whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.
p279
aVIs she an artisan or an artist?
p280
aVObviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.
p281
aVIf we can create markets for these artists,
p282
aVwe will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.
p283
aVThey will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.
p284
aV(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VLook at what Rojadeen has done.
p287
aVIn Motihari in Champaran,
p288
aVthere are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack
p289
aVand, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.
p290
aVEvery morning you have tea, as well as coffee.
p291
aVSo he thought, why don't I convert
p292
aVa pressure cooker into a coffee machine?
p293
aVSo this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.
p294
aVPeople bring their own cooker,
p295
aVhe attaches a valve and a steam pipe,
p296
aVand now he gives you espresso coffee. (Laughter)
p297
aVNow, this is a real, affordable
p298
aVcoffee percolator that works on gas.
p299
aV(Applause)
p300
aVLook at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.
p301
aVA lot of poor people do not have
p302
aVenough grains to get ground.
p303
aVSo this fellow is bringing
p304
aVa flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.
p305
aVIf you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram,
p306
aVhe will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.
p307
aa(lp308
VPlease understand the problem of poor people.
p309
aVThey have needs which
p310
aVhave to be met efficiently
p311
aVin terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.
p312
aVThey don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.
p313
aVBut to be able to give them high-quality output
p314
aVyou need to adapt technology to their needs.
p315
aVAnd that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.
p316
aVBut that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.
p317
aVIf you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them,
p318
aVhe brought a washing machine
p319
aVto your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.
p320
aVSo here's a model where
p321
aVa two-wheeler washing machine ...
p322
aVHe is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.
p323
aV(Applause)
p324
aVYou bring your water, you bring your soap,
p325
aVI wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee
p326
aVfor you per lot,
p327
aVand a new business model can emerge.
p328
aVNow, what we need is, we need
p329
aVpeople who will be able to scale them up.
p330
aa(lp331
VLook at this.
p332
aVIt looks like a beautiful photograph.
p333
aVBut you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?
p334
aVSomebody from India would know, of course.
p335
aVIt's a tawa.
p336
aVIt's a hot plate made of clay.
p337
aVNow, what is the beauty in it?
p338
aVWhen you have a non-stick pan,
p339
aVit costs about,
p340
aVmaybe, 250 rupees,
p341
aVfive dollars, six dollars.
p342
aVThis is less than a dollar
p343
aVand this is non-stick;
p344
aVit is coated with one of these
p345
aVfood-grade materials.
p346
aVAnd the best part is that,
p347
aVwhile you use a costly non-stick pan,
p348
aVyou eat the so-called Teflon
p349
aVor Teflon-like material
p350
aVbecause after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?
p351
aVIt has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that. (Laughter)
p352
aVYou know? But here
p353
aVin this clay hot plate,
p354
aVit will never go into your stomach.
p355
aVSo it is better, it is safer;
p356
aVit is affordable, it is energy-efficient.
p357
aVIn other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper,
p358
aVneed not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement.
p359
aa(lp360
VThey have to be better, they have to be more efficient,
p361
aVthey have to be affordable.
p362
aVAnd that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done.
p363
aVHe has designed this plate with a handle.
p364
aVAnd now with one dollar,
p365
aVyou can afford a better alternative
p366
aVthan the people market is offering you.
p367
aVThis lady, she developed
p368
aVa herbal pesticide formulation.
p369
aVWe filed the patent for her,
p370
aVthe National Innovation Foundation.
p371
aVAnd who knows? Somebody will license this technology
p372
aVand develop marketable products,
p373
aVand she would get revenue.
p374
aVNow, let me mention one thing:
p375
aVI think we need a polycentric model of development,
p376
aVwhere a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country,
p377
aVin different parts of the world,
p378
aVwould solve the needs of locality
p379
aVin a very efficient and adaptive manner.
p380
aVHigher the local fit,
p381
aVgreater is the chance of scaling up.
p382
aa(lp383
VIn the scaling up,
p384
aVthere's an inherent inadequacy
p385
aVto match the needs of the local people,
p386
aVpoint by point, with the supply that you're making.
p387
aVSo why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?
p388
aVThings can scale up, and they have scaled up.
p389
aVFor example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.
p390
aVNow, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone,
p391
aVonly three options on the cellphone.
p392
aVIt has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three
p393
aVbut I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.
p394
aVBut if I had to get a match to match,
p395
aVobviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.
p396
aVSo what we're saying is that scalability
p397
aVshould not become an enemy of sustainability.
p398
aVThere must be a place in the world
p399
aVfor solutions that are only relevant for a locality,
p400
aVand yet, one can be able to fund them.
p401
aa(lp402
VOne of the greatest studies that we've been finding is
p403
aVthat many times investors would ask this question \u2014
p404
aV"What is a scalable model?" \u2014
p405
aVas if the need of a community, which is only
p406
aVlocated in a space and time
p407
aVand has those needs only located in those places,
p408
aVhas no legitimate right to get them for free
p409
aVbecause it's not part of a larger scale.
p410
aVSo either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale
p411
aVor else you remain out.
p412
aVNow, the eminent model, the long-tail model
p413
aVtells you that small sales
p414
aVof a large number of books, for example,
p415
aVhaving only a few copies sold
p416
aVcan still be a viable model.
p417
aVAnd we must find a mechanism where
p418
aVpeople will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio,
p419
aVwhere different innovations will go to
p420
aVa small number of people in their localities,
p421
aVand yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.
p422
aa(lp423
VLook at what he is doing.
p424
aVSaidullah Sahib is an amazing man.
p425
aVAt the age of 70,
p426
aVhe is linking up something very creative.
p427
aa(lp428
V(Music)
p429
aa(lp430
VSaidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.
p431
aVI had to meet my love.
p432
aVMy desperation made me an innovator.
p433
aVEven love needs help from technology.
p434
aVInnovation is the light of my wife, Noor.
p435
aVNew inventions are the passion of my life.
p436
aVMy technology.
p437
aa(lp438
V(Applause)
p439
aa(lp440
VAG: Saidulluh Sahib is
p441
aVin Motihari, again in Champaran.
p442
aVWonderful human being,
p443
aVbut he stills sells, at this age,
p444
aVhoney on a cycle to earn his livelihood,
p445
aVbecause we haven't been able to convince the water park people,
p446
aVthe lake people, in [unclear] operations.
p447
aVAnd we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people
p448
aVin Mumbai \u2014 where there was a flood a few years ago
p449
aVand people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water \u2014
p450
aVthat, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office
p451
aVbecause you can then go to those lanes
p452
aVwhere your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.
p453
aVSo we have not yet cracked the problem
p454
aVof making it available as a rescue device,
p455
aVas a vending device during the floods in eastern India,
p456
aVwhen you have to deliver things to people
p457
aVin different islands
p458
aVwhere they're marooned.
p459
aVBut the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit.
p460
aa(lp461
VWhat has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more,
p462
aVbut he has left behind a message.
p463
aVA very powerful message
p464
aa(lp465
VAppachan: I watch the world wake up every day.
p466
aa(lp467
V(Music)
p468
aa(lp469
VIt's not that a coconut fell on my head,
p470
aVand I came upon this idea.
p471
aVWith no money to fund my studies,
p472
aVI scaled new heights.
p473
aVNow, they call me the local Spiderman.
p474
aVMy technology.
p475
aa(lp476
V(Applause)
p477
aa(lp478
VAG: Many of you
p479
aVmight not realize and believe
p480
aVthat we have sold this product internationally \u2014
p481
aVwhat I call a G2G model,
p482
aVgrassroots to global.
p483
aVAnd a professor in the University of Massachusetts,
p484
aVin the zoology department,
p485
aVbought this climber because she wanted
p486
aVto study the insect diversity
p487
aVof the top of the tree canopy.
p488
aVAnd this device makes it possible
p489
aVfor her to take samples from a larger number of palms,
p490
aVrather than only a few,
p491
aVbecause otherwise she had to make a big platform
p492
aVand then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.
p493
aVSo, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science.
p494
aa(lp495
VRemya Jose has developed ...
p496
aVyou can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates
p497
aVand then you will find these videos.
p498
aVInnovation by her when she was in class 10th:
p499
aVa washing machine-cum-exercising machine.
p500
aVMr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person,
p501
aVone and a half foot height, only.
p502
aVBut he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy
p503
aVand freedom and flexibility.
p504
aVThis innovation is from the slums of Rio.
p505
aVAnd this person, Mr. Ubirajara.
p506
aVWe were talking about, my friends in Brazil,
p507
aVhow we scale up this model in China and Brazil.
p508
aVAnd we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly,
p509
aVbut also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.
p510
aVThis stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.
p511
aVIndia and China have the largest number of cycles.
p512
aVBut this innovation emerged in Brazil.
p513
aa(lp514
VThe point is, none of us should be parochial,
p515
aVnone of us should be so nationalistic to believe
p516
aVthat all good ideas will come only from our country.
p517
aVNo, we have to have the humility to learn
p518
aVfrom knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.
p519
aVAnd look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations:
p520
aVcycle that's a sprayer, cycle that
p521
aVgenerates energy from the shocks on the road.
p522
aVI can't change the condition of the road,
p523
aVbut I can make the cycle run faster.
p524
aVThat is what Kanak Das has done.
p525
aVAnd in South Africa,
p526
aVwe had taken our innovators,
p527
aVand many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa
p528
aVas to how innovation can become
p529
aVa means of liberation
p530
aVfrom the drudgery that people have.
p531
aVAnd this is a donkey cart which they modified.
p532
aVThere's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg,
p533
aVserving no purpose.
p534
aVRemove it, the cart needs one donkey less.
p535
aa(lp536
VThis is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.
p537
aVThese three people in the village
p538
aVsat down and decided to think,
p539
aV"How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?"
p540
aVThey were not related to her, but they tried to find out,
p541
aV"How can we use ... "
p542
aVThey used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.
p543
aVAnd this breathing apparatus now saved the life,
p544
aVand she's very welcome.
p545
aa(lp546
VThere's a whole range of innovations that we have.
p547
aVA car, which runs on compressed air
p548
aVwith six paisa per kilometer.
p549
aVAssam, Kanak Gogoi.
p550
aVAnd you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe,
p551
aVbut this is available in India.
p552
aVNow, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn
p553
aVfor Pochampally Saree.
p554
aVIn one day, 18,000 times,
p555
aVshe had to do this winding
p556
aVto generate two sarees.
p557
aVThis is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.
p558
aVShe said, "Change your profession."
p559
aVHe said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine,
p560
aVwhich will solve your problem."
p561
aVAnd this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.
p562
aVSo, this is what SRISTI is saying:
p563
aV"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world."
p564
aa(lp565
VI will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children
p566
aVfor creativity, a whole range of things.
p567
aVWe have sold things all over the world,
p568
aVfrom Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.
p569
aVProducts have gone to the market, a few.
p570
aVThese are the people whose knowledge made
p571
aVthis Herbavate cream for eczema possible.
p572
aVAnd here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide
p573
aVput a photograph of the innovator on the packing
p574
aVso that every time a user uses it,
p575
aVit asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.
p576
aVIf you have an idea, send it back to us."
p577
aVSo, creativity counts, knowledge matters,
p578
aVinnovations transform, incentives inspire.
p579
aVAnd incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives.
p580
aa(lp581
VThank you.

VHi.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VI did that for two reasons.
p8
aVFirst of all, I wanted to give you
p9
aVa good visual first impression.
p10
aVBut the main reason I did it is that
p11
aVthat's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear
p12
aVa Lady Gaga skanky mic.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VI'm used to a stationary mic.
p17
aVIt's the sensible shoe of public address.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VBut you clamp this thing on my head, and something happens.
p22
aVI just become skanky.
p23
aV(Laughter) So I'm sorry about that.
p24
aVAnd I'm already off-message.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VLadies and gentlemen,
p29
aVI have devoted the past 25 years of my life
p30
aVto designing books.
p31
aV("Yes, BOOKS. You know, the bound volumes with ink on paper.
p32
aVYou cannot turn them off with a switch.
p33
aVTell your kids.")
p34
aVIt all sort of started as a benign mistake,
p35
aVlike penicillin. (Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VWhat I really wanted
p38
aVwas to be a graphic designer
p39
aVat one of the big design firms in New York City.
p40
aVBut upon arrival there,
p41
aVin the fall of 1986, and doing a lot of interviews,
p42
aVI found that the only thing I was offered
p43
aVwas to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf,
p44
aVa book publisher.
p45
aVNow I was stupid,
p46
aVbut not so stupid that I turned it down.
p47
aa(lp48
VI had absolutely no idea
p49
aVwhat I was about to become part of,
p50
aVand I was incredibly lucky.
p51
aVSoon, it had occurred to me what my job was.
p52
aVMy job was to ask this question:
p53
aV"What do the stories look like?"
p54
aVBecause that is what Knopf is.
p55
aVIt is the story factory, one of the very best in the world.
p56
aVWe bring stories to the public.
p57
aa(lp58
VThe stories can be anything,
p59
aVand some of them are actually true.
p60
aVBut they all have one thing in common:
p61
aVThey all need to look like something.
p62
aVThey all need a face.
p63
aVWhy? To give you a first impression
p64
aVof what you are about to get into.
p65
aVA book designer gives form to content,
p66
aVbut also
p67
aVmanages a very careful balance between the two.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, the first day
p70
aVof my graphic design training at Penn State University,
p71
aVthe teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room
p72
aVand he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard,
p73
aVand wrote the word "Apple" underneath,
p74
aVand he said, "OK. Lesson one. Listen up."
p75
aVAnd he covered up the picture and he said,
p76
aV"You either say this," and then he covered up the word,
p77
aV"or you show this.
p78
aVBut you don't do this."
p79
aVBecause this is treating your audience like a moron.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVAnd they deserve better.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd lo and behold, soon enough,
p84
aVI was able to put this theory to the test
p85
aVon two books that I was working on for Knopf.
p86
aVThe first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs,
p87
aVand the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich.
p88
aVNow the Hepburn book
p89
aVwas written in a very conversational style,
p90
aVit was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.
p91
aVThe Dietrich book was an observation
p92
aVby her daughter; it was a biography.
p93
aVSo the Hepburn story is words
p94
aVand the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.
p95
aVSo there you are.
p96
aVPure content and pure form, side by side.
p97
aVNo fighting, ladies.
p98
aa(lp99
V("What's a Jurassic Park?")
p100
aVNow, what is the story here?
p101
aVSomeone
p102
aVis re-engineering dinosaurs
p103
aVby extracting their DNA
p104
aVfrom prehistoric amber.
p105
aVGenius!
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VNow, luckily for me,
p109
aVI live and work in New York City,
p110
aVwhere there are plenty of dinosaurs.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVSo,
p113
aVI went to the Museum of Natural History,
p114
aVand I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop,
p115
aVand I bought a book.
p116
aVAnd I was particularly taken with this page of the book,
p117
aVand more specifically the lower right-hand corner.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow I took this diagram,
p120
aVand I put it in a Photostat machine,
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVand I took a piece of tracing paper,
p123
aVand I taped it over the Photostat
p124
aVwith a piece of Scotch tape \u2014 stop me if I'm going too fast \u2014
p125
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p126
aVand then I took a Rapidograph pen \u2014
p127
aVexplain it to the youngsters \u2014
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVand I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur.
p130
aa(lp131
VI had no idea what I was doing,
p132
aVI had no idea where I was going,
p133
aVbut at some point, I stopped \u2014
p134
aVwhen to keep going would seem like I was going too far.
p135
aVAnd what I ended up with was a graphic representation
p136
aVof us seeing this animal coming into being.
p137
aVWe're in the middle of the process.
p138
aVAnd then I just threw some typography on it.
p139
aVVery basic stuff,
p140
aVslightly suggestive of public park signage.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VEverybody in house loved it,
p144
aVand so off it goes to the author.
p145
aVAnd even back then,
p146
aVMichael was on the cutting edge.
p147
aV("Michael Crichton responds by fax:")
p148
aV("Wow! Fucking Fantastic Jacket")
p149
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p150
aVThat was a relief to see that pour out of the machine.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aVI miss Michael.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal
p155
aVcalls our legal department to see if they can
p156
aVmaybe look into buying the rights to the image,
p157
aVjust in case they might want to use it.
p158
aVWell, they used it.
p159
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd I was thrilled.
p162
aVWe all know it was an amazing movie,
p163
aVand it was so interesting to see it
p164
aVgo out into the culture and become this phenomenon
p165
aVand to see all the different permutations of it.
p166
aVBut not too long ago,
p167
aVI came upon this on the Web.
p168
aVNo, that is not me.
p169
aVBut whoever it is,
p170
aVI can't help but thinking they woke up one day like,
p171
aV"Oh my God, that wasn't there last night. Ooooohh!
p172
aVI was so wasted."
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VBut if you think about it, from my head
p176
aVto my hands to his leg.
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aVThat's a responsibility.
p179
aVAnd it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly.
p180
aVThe book designer's responsibility is threefold:
p181
aVto the reader, to the publisher and, most of all, to the author.
p182
aVI want you to look at the author's book
p183
aVand say, "Wow! I need to read that."
p184
aa(lp185
VDavid Sedaris is one of my favorite writers,
p186
aVand the title essay
p187
aVin this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony.
p188
aVAnd the reason he went is because
p189
aVhe had a fear of his body image,
p190
aVand he wanted to explore what was underlying that.
p191
aVFor me, it was simply an excuse to design a book
p192
aVthat you could literally take the pants off of.
p193
aVBut when you do,
p194
aVyou don't get what you expect.
p195
aVYou get something that goes much deeper than that.
p196
aVAnd David especially loved this design
p197
aVbecause at book signings, which he does a lot of,
p198
aVhe could take a magic marker and do this.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aVHello!
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VAugusten Burroughs wrote a memoir
p204
aVcalled ["Dry"], and it's about his time in rehab.
p205
aVIn his 20s, he was a hotshot ad executive,
p206
aVand as Mad Men has told us, a raging alcoholic.
p207
aVHe did not think so, however,
p208
aVbut his coworkers did an intervention and they said,
p209
aV"You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die."
p210
aa(lp211
VNow to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution,
p212
aVwhat I would call the opposite of Type 101.
p213
aVWhat does that mean?
p214
aVUsually on the first day of Introduction to Typography,
p215
aVyou get the assignment of, select a word
p216
aVand make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?
p217
aVVery simple stuff.
p218
aVThis is going to be the opposite of that.
p219
aVI want this book to look like it's lying to you,
p220
aVdesperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.
p221
aa(lp222
VThe answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine.
p223
aVI set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer
p224
aVwith water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall
p225
aVand threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!
p226
aVThen when we went to press,
p227
aVthe printer put a spot gloss on the ink
p228
aVand it really looked like it was running.
p229
aa(lp230
VNot long after it came out, Augusten was waylaid in an airport
p231
aVand he was hiding out in the bookstore
p232
aVspying on who was buying his books.
p233
aVAnd this woman came up to it,
p234
aVand she squinted, and she took it to the register,
p235
aVand she said to the man behind the counter, "This one's ruined."
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVAnd the guy behind the counter said, "I know, lady. They all came in that way."
p238
aV(Laughter)
p239
aVNow, that's a good printing job.
p240
aa(lp241
VA book cover
p242
aVis a distillation.
p243
aVIt is a haiku,
p244
aVif you will, of the story.
p245
aVThis particular story
p246
aVby Osama Tezuka
p247
aVis his epic life of the Buddha,
p248
aVand it's eight volumes in all. But the best thing is
p249
aVwhen it's on your shelf, you get a shelf life
p250
aVof the Buddha, moving from one age to the next.
p251
aVAll of these solutions
p252
aVderive their origins from the text of the book,
p253
aVbut once the book designer has read the text,
p254
aVthen he has to be an interpreter
p255
aVand a translator.
p256
aa(lp257
VThis story was a real puzzle.
p258
aVThis is what it's about.
p259
aV("Intrigue and murder among 16th century Ottoman court painters.")
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VAll right, so I got a collection of the paintings together
p264
aVand I looked at them and I deconstructed them
p265
aVand I put them back together.
p266
aVAnd so, here's the design, right?
p267
aVAnd so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.
p268
aVBut the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf.
p269
aa(lp270
VAhh! We come upon them,
p271
aVthe clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out.
p272
aVHuhh! They've been discovered by the sultan.
p273
aVHe will not be pleased.
p274
aVHuhh! And now the sultan is in danger.
p275
aVAnd now, we have to open it up
p276
aVto find out what's going to happen next.
p277
aVTry experiencing that on a Kindle.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VDon't get me started.
p281
aVSeriously.
p282
aVMuch is to be gained by eBooks:
p283
aVease, convenience, portability.
p284
aVBut something is definitely lost: tradition,
p285
aVa sensual experience, the comfort of thingy-ness \u2014
p286
aVa little bit of humanity.
p287
aa(lp288
VDo you know what John Updike used to do
p289
aVthe first thing when he would get a copy
p290
aVof one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf?
p291
aVHe'd smell it.
p292
aVThen he'd run his hand over the rag paper,
p293
aVand the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages.
p294
aVAll those years, all those books, he never got tired of it.
p295
aVNow, I am all for the iPad,
p296
aVbut trust me \u2014 smelling it will get you nowhere.
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aVNow the Apple guys are texting,
p299
aV"Develop odor emission plug-in."
p300
aV(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story.
p303
aVA woman
p304
aVnamed Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself
p305
aVnegotiating down a spiral staircase
p306
aVoff an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom,
p307
aVshe can't help but feel that, all of a sudden,
p308
aVshe's entered a new reality
p309
aVthat's just slightly different from the one that she left,
p310
aVbut very similar, but different.
p311
aVAnd so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence,
p312
aVsort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo how do we show this?
p315
aVWe go back to Hepburn and Dietrich, but now we merge them.
p316
aVSo we're talking about different planes, different pieces of paper.
p317
aVSo this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum.
p318
aVIt's one part of the form and content.
p319
aVWhen it's on top of the paper board,
p320
aVwhich is the opposite, it forms this.
p321
aVSo even if you don't know anything about this book,
p322
aVyou are forced to consider a single person
p323
aVstraddling two planes of existence.
p324
aVAnd the object itself invited exploration
p325
aVinteraction, consideration
p326
aVand touch.
p327
aa(lp328
VThis debuted at number two
p329
aVon the New York Times Best Seller list.
p330
aVThis is unheard of,
p331
aVboth for us the publisher, and the author.
p332
aVWe're talking a 900-page book
p333
aVthat is as weird as it is compelling,
p334
aVand featuring a climactic scene
p335
aVin which a horde of tiny people
p336
aVemerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl
p337
aVand cause a German Shepherd to explode.
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aVNot exactly Jackie Collins.
p340
aVFourteen weeks on the Best Seller list,
p341
aVeight printings, and still going strong.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo even though we love publishing as an art,
p344
aVwe very much know it's a business too,
p345
aVand that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky,
p346
aVthat great art can be great business.
p347
aa(lp348
VSo that's my story. To be continued.
p349
aVWhat does it look like?
p350
aVYes. It can, it does and it will,
p351
aVbut for this book designer,
p352
aVpage-turner,
p353
aVdog-eared place-holder,
p354
aVnotes in the margins-taker,
p355
aVink-sniffer,
p356
aVthe story looks like this.
p357
aa(lp358
VThank you.

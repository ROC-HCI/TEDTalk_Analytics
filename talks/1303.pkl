VI'm here to talk to you
p5
aVabout the economic invisibility of nature.
p6
aVThe bad news
p7
aVis that mother nature's back office isn't working yet,
p8
aVso those invoices don't get issued.
p9
aVBut we need to do something about this problem.
p10
aVI began my life as a markets professional
p11
aVand continued to take an interest,
p12
aVbut most of my recent effort
p13
aVhas been looking at the value
p14
aVof what comes to human beings from nature,
p15
aVand which doesn't get priced by the markets.
p16
aa(lp17
VA project called TEEB was started in 2007,
p18
aVand it was launched by a group of environment ministers
p19
aVof the G8+5.
p20
aVAnd their basic inspiration
p21
aVwas a stern review of Lord Stern.
p22
aVThey asked themselves a question:
p23
aVIf economics could make such a convincing case
p24
aVfor early action on climate change,
p25
aVwell why can't the same be done for conservation?
p26
aVWhy can't an equivalent case be made
p27
aVfor nature?
p28
aVAnd the answer is: Yeah, it can.
p29
aVBut it's not that straightforward.
p30
aVBiodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas.
p31
aVIt exists in many layers,
p32
aVecosystems, species and genes across many scales \u2014
p33
aVinternational, national, local, community \u2014
p34
aVand doing for nature
p35
aVwhat Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd yet, we began.
p38
aVWe began the project with an interim report,
p39
aVwhich quickly pulled together
p40
aVa lot of information that had been collected on the subject
p41
aVby many, many researchers.
p42
aVAnd amongst our compiled results
p43
aVwas the startling revelation
p44
aVthat, in fact, we were losing natural capital \u2014
p45
aVthe benefits that flow from nature to us.
p46
aVWe were losing it at an extraordinary rate \u2014
p47
aVin fact, of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth
p48
aVof natural capital.
p49
aVThis came out in 2008,
p50
aVwhich was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shown
p51
aVthat we had lost financial capital
p52
aVof the order of two and a half trillion dollars.
p53
aVSo this was comparable in size to that kind of loss.
p54
aVWe then have gone on since
p55
aVto present for [the] international community,
p56
aVfor governments,
p57
aVfor local governments and for business
p58
aVand for people, for you and me,
p59
aVa whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year,
p60
aVwhich address the economic invisibility of nature
p61
aVand describe what can be done to solve it.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhat is this about?
p64
aVA picture that you're familiar with \u2014
p65
aVthe Amazon rainforests.
p66
aVIt's a massive store of carbon, it's an amazing store of biodiversity,
p67
aVbut what people don't really know
p68
aVis this also is a rain factory.
p69
aVBecause the northeastern trade winds,
p70
aVas they go over the Amazonas,
p71
aVeffectively gather the water vapor.
p72
aVSomething like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor
p73
aVis sucked up by the northeastern trade winds,
p74
aVand eventually precipitates in the form of rain
p75
aVacross the La Plata Basin.
p76
aVThis rainfall cycle, this rainfall factory,
p77
aVeffectively feeds an agricultural economy
p78
aVof the order of 240 billion dollars-worth
p79
aVin Latin America.
p80
aVBut the question arises: Okay, so how much
p81
aVdo Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina
p82
aVand indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil
p83
aVpay for that vital input to that economy
p84
aVto the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall?
p85
aVAnd the answer is zilch,
p86
aVexactly zero.
p87
aVThat's the economic invisibility of nature.
p88
aVThat can't keep going on,
p89
aVbecause economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful.
p90
aVEconomics has become the currency of policy.
p91
aVAnd unless we address
p92
aVthis invisibility,
p93
aVwe are going to get the results that we are seeing,
p94
aVwhich is a gradual degradation and loss
p95
aVof this valuable natural asset.
p96
aa(lp97
VIt's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests.
p98
aVNo matter what level you look at,
p99
aVwhether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level,
p100
aVwe see the same problem again and again.
p101
aVSo rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests
p102
aVat an ecosystem level.
p103
aVAt the species level,
p104
aVit's been estimated that insect-based pollination,
p105
aVbees pollinating fruit and so on,
p106
aVis something like 190 billion dollars-worth.
p107
aVThat's something like eight percent
p108
aVof the total agricultural output globally.
p109
aVIt completely passes below the radar screen.
p110
aVBut when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice?
p111
aVOr for that matter, if you look at the genetic level,
p112
aV60 percent of medicines were prospected,
p113
aVwere found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef.
p114
aVOnce again, most of that doesn't get paid.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd that brings me to another aspect of this,
p117
aVwhich is, to whom should this get paid?
p118
aVThat genetic material
p119
aVprobably belonged, if it could belong to anyone,
p120
aVto a local community of poor people
p121
aVwho parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule,
p122
aVwhich then became the medicine.
p123
aVThey were the ones that didn't get paid.
p124
aVAnd if you look at the species level,
p125
aVyou saw about fish.
p126
aVToday, the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant
p127
aVthat effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor,
p128
aVthe artisanal fisher folk
p129
aVand those who fish for their own livelihoods,
p130
aVto feed their families.
p131
aVSomething like a billion people depend on fish,
p132
aVthe quantity of fish in the oceans.
p133
aVA billion people depend on fish
p134
aVfor their main source for animal protein.
p135
aVAnd at this rate at which we are losing fish,
p136
aVit is a human problem of enormous dimensions,
p137
aVa health problem
p138
aVof a kind we haven't seen before.
p139
aVAnd finally, at the ecosystem level,
p140
aVwhether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests,
p141
aVor whether it is the ability of poor farmers
p142
aVto go out and gather leaf litter
p143
aVfor their cattle and goats,
p144
aVor whether it's the ability of their wives
p145
aVto go and collect fuel wood from the forest,
p146
aVit is actually the poor
p147
aVwho depend most on these ecosystem services.
p148
aa(lp149
VWe did estimates in our study
p150
aVthat for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia,
p151
aVeven though ecosystem services \u2014
p152
aVthese benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free \u2014
p153
aVthey're not very big in percentage terms of GDP \u2014
p154
aVtwo, four, eight, 10, 15 percent \u2014
p155
aVbut in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor,
p156
aVthe answers are more like
p157
aV45 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent.
p158
aVThat's the difference.
p159
aVBecause these are important benefits for the poor.
p160
aVAnd you can't really have a proper model for development
p161
aVif at the same time you're destroying or allowing
p162
aVthe degradation of the very asset, the most important asset,
p163
aVwhich is your development asset,
p164
aVthat is ecological infrastructure.
p165
aa(lp166
VHow bad can things get?
p167
aVWell here a picture of something called the mean species abundance.
p168
aVIt's basically a measure
p169
aVof how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average
p170
aVof biomass of various species are around.
p171
aVThe green represents the percentage.
p172
aVIf you start green, it's like 80 to 100 percent.
p173
aVIf it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent.
p174
aVAnd these are percentages versus the original state, so to speak,
p175
aVthe pre-industrial era, 1750.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow I'm going to show you
p178
aVhow business as usual will affect this.
p179
aVAnd just watch the change in colors
p180
aVin India, China, Europe,
p181
aVsub-Saharan Africa
p182
aVas we move on and consume global biomass
p183
aVat a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us.
p184
aVSee that again.
p185
aVThe only places that remain green \u2014 and that's not good news \u2014
p186
aVis, in fact, places like the Gobi Desert,
p187
aVlike the tundra and like the Sahara.
p188
aVBut that doesn't help because there were very few species
p189
aVand volume of biomass there in the first place.
p190
aVThis is the challenge.
p191
aVThe reason this is happening
p192
aVboils down, in my mind, to one basic problem,
p193
aVwhich is our inability to perceive the difference
p194
aVbetween public benefits
p195
aVand private profits.
p196
aVWe tend to constantly ignore public wealth
p197
aVsimply because it is in the common wealth,
p198
aVit's common goods.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd here's an example from Thailand
p201
aVwhere we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much \u2014
p202
aVit's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured \u2014
p203
aVcompared to its value as a shrimp farm,
p204
aVwhich is more like $9,600,
p205
aVthere has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves
p206
aVand convert them to shrimp farms.
p207
aVBut of course, if you look at exactly what those profits are,
p208
aValmost 8,000 of those dollars
p209
aVare, in fact, subsidies.
p210
aVSo you compare the two sides of the coin
p211
aVand you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600.
p212
aVThat's not that hard.
p213
aa(lp214
VBut on the other hand, if you start measuring,
p215
aVhow much would it actually cost
p216
aVto restore the land of the shrimp farm
p217
aVback to productive use?
p218
aVOnce salt deposition and chemical deposition
p219
aVhas had its effects,
p220
aVthat answer is more like $12,000 of cost.
p221
aVAnd if you see the benefits of the mangrove
p222
aVin terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get
p223
aVand in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries,
p224
aVthat provide fish for the poor,
p225
aVthat answer is more like $11,000.
p226
aVSo now look at the different lens.
p227
aVIf you look at the lens of public wealth
p228
aVas against the lens of private profits,
p229
aVyou get a completely different answer,
p230
aVwhich is clearly conservation makes more sense,
p231
aVand not destruction.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo is this just a story from South Thailand?
p234
aVSorry, this is a global story.
p235
aVAnd here's what the same calculation looks like,
p236
aVwhich was done recently \u2014 well I say recently, over the last 10 years \u2014
p237
aVby a group called TRUCOST.
p238
aVAnd they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations,
p239
aVwhat are the externalities?
p240
aVIn other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual?
p241
aVThis is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual,
p242
aVwhich causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost.
p243
aVIt causes pollutants being issued, which have an economic cost,
p244
aVhealth cost and so on.
p245
aVUse of freshwater.
p246
aVIf you drill water to make coke near a village farm,
p247
aVthat's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community.
p248
aa(lp249
VCan we stop this, and how?
p250
aVI think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital.
p251
aVBasically the stuff of life is natural capital,
p252
aVand we need to recognize and build that into our systems.
p253
aVWhen we measure GDP
p254
aVas a measure of economic performance at the national level,
p255
aVwe don't include our biggest asset at the country level.
p256
aVWhen we measure corporate performances,
p257
aVwe don't include our impacts on nature
p258
aVand what our business costs society.
p259
aVThat has to stop.
p260
aVIn fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase.
p261
aVI began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project.
p262
aVThat was in the early 2000s
p263
aVwhen India was going gung-ho about GDP growth
p264
aVas the means forward \u2014
p265
aVlooking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percent
p266
aVand wondering, why can we do the same?
p267
aVAnd a few friends of mine and I
p268
aVdecided this doesn't make sense.
p269
aVThis is going to create more cost to society and more losses.
p270
aVSo we decided to do a massive set of calculations
p271
aVand started producing green accounts for India and its states.
p272
aVThat's how my interests began
p273
aVand went to the TEEB project.
p274
aVCalculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun.
p275
aVAnd the World Bank has acknowledged this
p276
aVand they've started a project called WAVES \u2014
p277
aVWealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services.
p278
aa(lp279
VBut calculating this at the next level,
p280
aVthat means at the business sector level, is important.
p281
aVAnd actually we've done this with the TEEB project.
p282
aVWe've done this for a very difficult case,
p283
aVwhich was for deforestation in China.
p284
aVThis is important, because in China in 1997,
p285
aVthe Yellow River actually went dry for nine months
p286
aVcausing severe loss of agriculture output
p287
aVand pain and loss to society.
p288
aVJust a year later the Yangtze flooded,
p289
aVcausing something like 5,500 deaths.
p290
aVSo clearly there was a problem with deforestation.
p291
aVIt was associated largely with the construction industry.
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd the Chinese government responded sensibly
p294
aVand placed a ban on felling.
p295
aVA retrospective on 40 years
p296
aVshows that if we had accounted for these costs \u2014
p297
aVthe cost of loss of topsoil,
p298
aVthe cost of loss of waterways,
p299
aVthe lost productivity, the loss to local communities
p300
aVas a result of all these factors,
p301
aVdesertification and so on \u2014
p302
aVthose costs are almost twice as much
p303
aVas the market price of timber.
p304
aVSo in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace
p305
aVought to have been three-times what it was
p306
aVhad it reflected the true pain and the costs
p307
aVto the society within China.
p308
aVOf course, after the event one can be wise.
p309
aa(lp310
VThe way to do this is to do it on a company basis,
p311
aVto take leadership forward,
p312
aVand to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost,
p313
aVand to disclose these answers.
p314
aVSomeone once asked me, "Who is better or worse,
p315
aVis it Unilever or is it P&G
p316
aVwhen it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?"
p317
aVAnd I couldn't answer because neither of these companies,
p318
aVgood though they are and professional though they are,
p319
aVdo not calculate or disclose their externalities.
p320
aa(lp321
VBut if we look at companies like PUMA \u2014
p322
aVJochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman,
p323
aVonce challenged me at a function,
p324
aVsaying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it.
p325
aVWell I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it.
p326
aVHe's basically worked the cost to PUMA.
p327
aVPUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover,
p328
aV300 million dollars of profits,
p329
aV200 million dollars after tax,
p330
aV94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business.
p331
aVNow that's not a happy situation for them,
p332
aVbut they have the confidence and the courage
p333
aVto come forward and say, "Here's what we are measuring.
p334
aVWe are measuring it because we know
p335
aVthat you cannot manage what you do not measure."
p336
aa(lp337
VThat's an example, I think, for us to look at
p338
aVand for us to draw comfort from.
p339
aVIf more companies did this,
p340
aVand if more sectors engaged this as sectors,
p341
aVyou could have analysts, business analysts,
p342
aVand you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs
p343
aVactually look and compare the social performance of companies.
p344
aVToday we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out.
p345
aVThis can be done.
p346
aVAnd I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.
p347
aVhas already set up a coalition to do this,
p348
aVan international coalition.
p349
aa(lp350
VThe other favorite, if you like, solution for me
p351
aVis the creation of green carbon markets.
p352
aVAnd by the way, these are my favorites \u2014
p353
aVexternalities calculation and green carbon markets.
p354
aVTEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions
p355
aVincluding protected area evaluation
p356
aVand payments for ecosystem services
p357
aVand eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites.
p358
aVWhat's green carbon?
p359
aVToday what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace.
p360
aVIt's about energy emissions.
p361
aVThe European Union ETS is the main marketplace.
p362
aVIt's not doing too well. We've over-issued.
p363
aVA bit like inflation: you over-issue currency,
p364
aVyou get what you see, declining prices.
p365
aVBut that's all about energy and industry.
p366
aa(lp367
VBut what we're missing is also some other emissions
p368
aVlike black carbon, that is soot.
p369
aVWhat we're also missing is blue carbon,
p370
aVwhich, by the way, is the largest store of carbon \u2014
p371
aVmore than 55 percent.
p372
aVThankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissions
p373
aVfrom the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa,
p374
aVis more or less balanced.
p375
aVIn fact, what's being absorbed
p376
aVis something like 25 percent of our emissions,
p377
aVwhich then leads to acidification
p378
aVor lower alkalinity in oceans.
p379
aVMore of that in a minute.
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd finally, there's deforestation,
p382
aVand there's emission of methane
p383
aVfrom agriculture.
p384
aVGreen carbon,
p385
aVwhich is the deforestation and agricultural emissions,
p386
aVand blue carbon
p387
aVtogether comprise 25 percent of our emissions.
p388
aVWe have the means already in our hands,
p389
aVthrough a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus \u2014
p390
aVa scheme for the reduced emissions
p391
aVfrom deforestation and forest degradation.
p392
aVAnd already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each
p393
aVtowards Indonesia and Brazil
p394
aVto implement this Red Plus scheme.
p395
aVSo we actually have some movement forward.
p396
aVBut the thing is to do a lot more of that.
p397
aa(lp398
VWill this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything?
p399
aVWell I'm afraid not.
p400
aVThere is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs.
p401
aVAs you can see,
p402
aVthey cut across the entire globe
p403
aVall the way from Micronesia
p404
aVacross Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascar
p405
aVand to the West of the Caribbean.
p406
aVThese red dots, these red areas,
p407
aVbasically provide the food and livelihood
p408
aVfor more than half a billion people.
p409
aVSo that's almost an eighth of society.
p410
aVAnd the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost \u2014
p411
aVand scientists tell us
p412
aVthat any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million
p413
aVis too dangerous for the survival of these reefs \u2014
p414
aVwe are not only risking the extinction
p415
aVof the entire coral species, the warm water corals,
p416
aVwe're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans,
p417
aVbut we are risking the very lives and livelihoods
p418
aVof more than 500 million people
p419
aVwho live in the developing world in poor countries.
p420
aa(lp421
VSo in selecting targets of 450 parts per million
p422
aVand selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations,
p423
aVwhat we have done is we've made an ethical choice.
p424
aVWe've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society
p425
aVto not have coral reefs.
p426
aVWell what I will say to you in parting
p427
aVis that we may have done that.
p428
aVLet's think about it and what it means,
p429
aVbut please, let's not do more of that.
p430
aVBecause mother nature only has that much
p431
aVin ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital.
p432
aVI don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices.
p433
aa(lp434
VThank you.
p435
aa(lp436

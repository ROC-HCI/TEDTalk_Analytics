VThis is a painting from the 16th century from Lucas Cranach the Elder.
p5
aVIt shows the famous Fountain of Youth.
p6
aVIf you drink its water or you bathe in it, you will get health and youth.
p7
aVEvery culture, every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth.
p8
aVThere are people like Alexander the Great or Ponce De León, the explorer,
p9
aVwho spent much of their life chasing the Fountain of Youth.
p10
aVThey didn't find it.
p11
aVBut what if there was something to it?
p12
aVWhat if there was something to this Fountain of Youth?
p13
aa(lp14
VI will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research
p15
aVthat could revolutionize the way we think about aging
p16
aVand how we may treat age-related diseases in the future.
p17
aVIt started with experiments that showed,
p18
aVin a recent number of studies about growing,
p19
aVthat animals \u2014 old mice \u2014 that share a blood supply with young mice
p20
aVcan get rejuvenated.
p21
aVThis is similar to what you might see in humans, in Siamese twins,
p22
aVand I know this sounds a bit creepy.
p23
aVBut what Tom Rando, a stem-cell researcher, reported in 2007,
p24
aVwas that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated
p25
aVif it's exposed to young blood through common circulation.
p26
aVThis was reproduced by Amy Wagers at Harvard a few years later,
p27
aVand others then showed that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed
p28
aVin the pancreas, the liver and the heart.
p29
aVBut what I'm most excited about, and several other labs as well,
p30
aVis that this may even apply to the brain.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo, what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment
p33
aVin this model called parabiosis,
p34
aVshows a younger brain \u2014
p35
aVand a brain that functions better.
p36
aVAnd I repeat:
p37
aVan old mouse that gets young blood through shared circulation
p38
aVlooks younger and functions younger in its brain.
p39
aVSo when we get older \u2014
p40
aVwe can look at different aspects of human cognition,
p41
aVand you can see on this slide here,
p42
aVwe can look at reasoning, verbal ability and so forth.
p43
aVAnd up to around age 50 or 60, these functions are all intact,
p44
aVand as I look at the young audience here in the room, we're all still fine.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VBut it's scary to see how all these curves go south.
p49
aVAnd as we get older,
p50
aVdiseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop.
p51
aVWe know that with age, the connections between neurons \u2014
p52
aVthe way neurons talk to each other, the synapses \u2014 they start to deteriorate;
p53
aVneurons die, the brain starts to shrink,
p54
aVand there's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases.
p55
aa(lp56
VOne big problem we have \u2014 to try to understand how this really works
p57
aVat a very molecular mechanistic level \u2014
p58
aVis that we can't study the brains in detail, in living people.
p59
aVWe can do cognitive tests, we can do imaging \u2014
p60
aVall kinds of sophisticated testing.
p61
aVBut we usually have to wait until the person dies
p62
aVto get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease.
p63
aVThis is what neuropathologists do, for example.
p64
aVSo, how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism.
p65
aVCould we potentially understand more
p66
aVabout what happens in the brain at the molecular level
p67
aVif we see the brain as part of the entire body?
p68
aVSo if the body ages or gets sick, does that affect the brain?
p69
aVAnd vice versa: as the brain gets older, does that influence the rest of the body?
p70
aVAnd what connects all the different tissues in the body
p71
aVis blood.
p72
aVBlood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen, for example,
p73
aVthe red blood cells,
p74
aVor fights infectious diseases,
p75
aVbut it also carries messenger molecules,
p76
aVhormone-like factors that transport information
p77
aVfrom one cell to another, from one tissue to another,
p78
aVincluding the brain.
p79
aVSo if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age,
p80
aVcan we learn something about the brain?
p81
aVWe know that as we get older, the blood changes as well,
p82
aVso these hormone-like factors change as we get older.
p83
aVAnd by and large, factors that we know are required
p84
aVfor the development of tissues, for the maintenance of tissues \u2014
p85
aVthey start to decrease as we get older,
p86
aVwhile factors involved in repair, in injury and in inflammation \u2014
p87
aVthey increase as we get older.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo there's this unbalance of good and bad factors, if you will.
p90
aVAnd to illustrate what we can do potentially with that,
p91
aVI want to talk you through an experiment that we did.
p92
aVWe had almost 300 blood samples from healthy human beings
p93
aV20 to 89 years of age,
p94
aVand we measured over 100 of these communication factors,
p95
aVthese hormone-like proteins that transport information between tissues.
p96
aVAnd what we noticed first
p97
aVis that between the youngest and the oldest group,
p98
aVabout half the factors changed significantly.
p99
aVSo our body lives in a very different environment as we get older,
p100
aVwhen it comes to these factors.
p101
aVAnd using statistical or bioinformatics programs,
p102
aVwe could try to discover those factors that best predict age \u2014
p103
aVin a way, back-calculate the relative age of a person.
p104
aVAnd the way this looks is shown in this graph.
p105
aVSo, on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived,
p106
aVthe chronological age.
p107
aVSo, how many years they lived.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd then we take these top factors that I showed you,
p110
aVand we calculate their relative age, their biological age.
p111
aVAnd what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation,
p112
aVso we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person.
p113
aVBut what's really exciting are the outliers,
p114
aVas they so often are in life.
p115
aVYou can see here, the person I highlighted with the green dot
p116
aVis about 70 years of age
p117
aVbut seems to have a biological age, if what we're doing here is really true,
p118
aVof only about 45.
p119
aVSo is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age?
p120
aVBut more importantly: Is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk
p121
aVto develop an age-related disease and will have a long life \u2014
p122
aVwill live to 100 or more?
p123
aVOn the other hand, the person here, highlighted with the red dot,
p124
aVis not even 40, but has a biological age of 65.
p125
aVIs this a person at an increased risk of developing an age-related disease?
p126
aVSo in our lab, we're trying to understand these factors better,
p127
aVand many other groups are trying to understand,
p128
aVwhat are the true aging factors,
p129
aVand can we learn something about them to possibly predict age-related diseases?
p130
aa(lp131
VSo what I've shown you so far is simply correlational, right?
p132
aVYou can just say, "Well, these factors change with age,"
p133
aVbut you don't really know if they do something about aging.
p134
aVSo what I'm going to show you now is very remarkable
p135
aVand it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue.
p136
aVAnd that's where we come back to this model called parabiosis.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, parabiosis is done in mice
p139
aVby surgically connecting the two mice together,
p140
aVand that leads then to a shared blood system,
p141
aVwhere we can now ask, "How does the old brain get influenced
p142
aVby exposure to the young blood?"
p143
aVAnd for this purpose, we use young mice
p144
aVthat are an equivalency of 20-year-old people,
p145
aVand old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhat we found is quite remarkable.
p148
aVWe find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons
p149
aVin these old brains.
p150
aVThere's an increased activity of the synapses,
p151
aVthe connections between neurons.
p152
aVThere are more genes expressed that are known to be involved
p153
aVin the formation of new memories.
p154
aVAnd there's less of this bad inflammation.
p155
aVBut we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals.
p156
aVSo when we connect them,
p157
aVthere are actually no cells going into the old brain, in this model.
p158
aVInstead, we've reasoned, then, that it must be the soluble factors,
p159
aVso we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma,
p160
aVand inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice,
p161
aVand we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects,
p162
aVbut what we could also do now
p163
aVis we could do memory tests with mice.
p164
aa(lp165
VAs mice get older, like us humans, they have memory problems.
p166
aVIt's just harder to detect them,
p167
aVbut I'll show you in a minute how we do that.
p168
aVBut we wanted to take this one step further,
p169
aVone step closer to potentially being relevant to humans.
p170
aVWhat I'm showing you now are unpublished studies,
p171
aVwhere we used human plasma, young human plasma,
p172
aVand as a control, saline,
p173
aVand injected it into old mice,
p174
aVand asked, can we again rejuvenate these old mice?
p175
aVCan we make them smarter?
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd to do this, we used a test. It's called a Barnes maze.
p178
aVThis is a big table that has lots of holes in it,
p179
aVand there are guide marks around it,
p180
aVand there's a bright light, as on this stage here.
p181
aVThe mice hate this and they try to escape,
p182
aVand find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow,
p183
aVwhere a tube is mounted underneath
p184
aVwhere they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole.
p185
aVSo we teach them, over several days,
p186
aVto find this space on these cues in the space,
p187
aVand you can compare this for humans,
p188
aVto finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VMany of us have probably had some problems with that.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo, let's look at an old mouse here.
p195
aVThis is an old mouse that has memory problems,
p196
aVas you'll notice in a moment.
p197
aVIt just looks into every hole, but it didn't form this spacial map
p198
aVthat would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day.
p199
aVIn stark contrast, this mouse here is a sibling of the same age,
p200
aVbut it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks,
p201
aVwith small injections every three days.
p202
aVAnd as you noticed, it almost looks around, "Where am I?" \u2014
p203
aVand then walks straight to that hole and escapes.
p204
aVSo, it could remember where that hole was.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo by all means, this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated \u2014
p207
aVit functions more like a younger mouse.
p208
aVAnd it also suggests that there is something
p209
aVnot only in young mouse plasma, but in young human plasma
p210
aVthat has the capacity to help this old brain.
p211
aVSo to summarize,
p212
aVwe find the old mouse, and its brain in particular, are malleable.
p213
aVThey're not set in stone; we can actually change them.
p214
aVIt can be rejuvenated.
p215
aVYoung blood factors can reverse aging,
p216
aVand what I didn't show you \u2014
p217
aVin this model, the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old.
p218
aVSo there are old-blood factors that can accelerate aging.
p219
aVAnd most importantly, humans may have similar factors,
p220
aVbecause we can take young human blood and have a similar effect.
p221
aVOld human blood, I didn't show you, does not have this effect;
p222
aVit does not make the mice younger.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo, is this magic transferable to humans?
p225
aVWe're running a small clinical study at Stanford,
p226
aVwhere we treat Alzheimer's patients with mild disease
p227
aVwith a pint of plasma from young volunteers, 20-year-olds,
p228
aVand do this once a week for four weeks,
p229
aVand then we look at their brains with imaging.
p230
aVWe test them cognitively,
p231
aVand we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living.
p232
aVWhat we hope is that there are some signs of improvement
p233
aVfrom this treatment.
p234
aVAnd if that's the case, that could give us hope
p235
aVthat what I showed you works in mice
p236
aVmight also work in humans.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow, I don't think we will live forever.
p239
aVBut maybe we discovered
p240
aVthat the Fountain of Youth is actually within us,
p241
aVand it has just dried out.
p242
aVAnd if we can turn it back on a little bit,
p243
aVmaybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects,
p244
aVwe can produce these factors synthetically
p245
aVand we can treat diseases of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease
p246
aVor other dementias.
p247
aa(lp248
VThank you very much.

VMy title: "Queerer than we can suppose: the strangeness of science."
p5
aV"Queerer than we can suppose" comes from J.B.S. Haldane, the famous biologist,
p6
aVwho said, "Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer
p7
aVthan we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.
p8
aVI suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth
p9
aVthan are dreamed of, or can be dreamed of, in any philosophy."
p10
aVRichard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories \u2014
p11
aVexperimental predictions \u2014
p12
aVto specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy.
p13
aVThis means that quantum theory has got to be, in some sense, true.
p14
aVYet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make
p15
aVin order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious
p16
aVthat even Feynman himself was moved to remark,
p17
aV"If you think you understand quantum theory,
p18
aVyou don't understand quantum theory."
p19
aa(lp20
VIt's so queer that physicists resort to one or another
p21
aVparadoxical interpretation of it.
p22
aVDavid Deutsch, who's talking here, in "The Fabric of Reality,"
p23
aVembraces the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory,
p24
aVbecause the worst that you can say about it
p25
aVis that it's preposterously wasteful.
p26
aVIt postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel,
p27
aVmutually undetectable,
p28
aVexcept through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments.
p29
aVAnd that's Richard Feynman.
p30
aa(lp31
VThe biologist Lewis Wolpert believes
p32
aVthat the queerness of modern physics
p33
aVis just an extreme example.
p34
aVScience, as opposed to technology,
p35
aVdoes violence to common sense.
p36
aVEvery time you drink a glass of water, he points out,
p37
aVthe odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule
p38
aVthat passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVIt's just elementary probability theory.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VThe number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater
p45
aVthan the number of glassfuls, or bladdersful, in the world.
p46
aVAnd of course, there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders \u2014
p47
aVyou have just breathed in a nitrogen atom
p48
aVthat passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon
p49
aVto the left of the tall cycad tree.
p50
aa(lp51
V"Queerer than we can suppose."
p52
aVWhat is it that makes us capable of supposing anything,
p53
aVand does this tell us anything about what we can suppose?
p54
aVAre there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp,
p55
aVbut not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence?
p56
aVAre there things about the universe
p57
aVthat are, in principle, ungraspable by any mind,
p58
aVhowever superior?
p59
aVThe history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms,
p60
aVas successive generations have come to terms with
p61
aVincreasing levels of queerness in the universe.
p62
aVWe're now so used to the idea that the Earth spins,
p63
aVrather than the Sun moves across the sky,
p64
aVit's hard for us to realize
p65
aVwhat a shattering mental revolution that must have been.
p66
aVAfter all, it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless,
p67
aVthe Sun, small and mobile.
p68
aVBut it's worth recalling Wittgenstein's remark on the subject:
p69
aV"Tell me," he asked a friend, "why do people always say
p70
aVit was natural for man to assume that the Sun went 'round the Earth,
p71
aVrather than that the Earth was rotating?"
p72
aVAnd his friend replied, "Well, obviously,
p73
aVbecause it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth."
p74
aVWittgenstein replied, "Well, what would it have looked like
p75
aVif it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?"
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VScience has taught us, against all intuition,
p80
aVthat apparently solid things, like crystals and rocks,
p81
aVare really almost entirely composed of empty space.
p82
aVAnd the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom
p83
aVis a fly in the middle of a sports stadium,
p84
aVand the next atom is in the next sports stadium.
p85
aVSo it would seem the hardest, solidest, densest rock
p86
aVis really almost entirely empty space,
p87
aVbroken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn't count.
p88
aVWhy, then, do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable?
p89
aVAs an evolutionary biologist, I'd say this: our brains have evolved
p90
aVto help us survive within the orders of magnitude, of size and speed
p91
aVwhich our bodies operate at.
p92
aVWe never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms.
p93
aVIf we had, our brains probably would perceive rocks
p94
aVas full of empty space.
p95
aVRocks feel hard and impenetrable
p96
aVto our hands, precisely because objects like rocks and hands
p97
aVcannot penetrate each other.
p98
aVIt's therefore useful
p99
aVfor our brains to construct notions like "solidity" and "impenetrability,"
p100
aVbecause such notions help us to navigate our bodies
p101
aVthrough the middle-sized world in which we have to navigate.
p102
aa(lp103
VMoving to the other end of the scale,
p104
aVour ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos
p105
aVat speeds close to the speed of light.
p106
aVIf they had, our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein.
p107
aVI want to give the name "Middle World" to the medium-scaled environment
p108
aVin which we've evolved the ability to take act \u2014
p109
aVnothing to do with "Middle Earth" \u2014
p110
aVMiddle World.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VWe are evolved denizens of Middle World,
p115
aVand that limits what we are capable of imagining.
p116
aVWe find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like,
p117
aVwhen a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity
p118
aVat which rabbits and other Middle World objects move,
p119
aVand hits another Middle World object like a rock, it knocks itself out.
p120
aa(lp121
VMay I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III,
p122
aVcommander of military intelligence in 1983.
p123
aa(lp124
V"...[He] stared at his wall in Arlington, Virginia, and decided to do it.
p125
aVAs frightening as the prospect was, he was going into the next office.
p126
aVHe stood up and moved out from behind his desk.
p127
aV'What is the atom mostly made of?' he thought, 'Space.'
p128
aVHe started walking. 'What am I mostly made of? Atoms.'
p129
aVHe quickened his pace, almost to a jog now.
p130
aV'What is the wall mostly made of?'
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
V'Atoms!'
p135
aVAll I have to do is merge the spaces.
p136
aVThen, General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office.
p137
aVStubblebine, who commanded 16,000 soldiers,
p138
aVwas confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall.
p139
aVHe has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool
p140
aVin the military arsenal.
p141
aVWho would screw around with an army that could do that?"
p142
aa(lp143
VThat's from an article in Playboy,
p144
aVwhich I was reading the other day.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VI have every reason to think it's true;
p149
aVI was reading Playboy because I, myself, had an article in it.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VUnaided human intuition, schooled in Middle World,
p154
aVfinds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us
p155
aVa heavy object and a light object, air friction aside,
p156
aVwould hit the ground at the same instant.
p157
aVAnd that's because in Middle World, air friction is always there.
p158
aVIf we'd evolved in a vacuum,
p159
aVwe would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously.
p160
aVIf we were bacteria,
p161
aVconstantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules,
p162
aVit would be different.
p163
aVBut we Middle-Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion.
p164
aVIn the same way, our lives are dominated by gravity,
p165
aVbut are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension.
p166
aVA small insect would reverse these priorities.
p167
aa(lp168
VSteve Grand \u2014 he's the one on the left,
p169
aVDouglas Adams is on the right.
p170
aVSteve Grand, in his book, "Creation: Life and How to Make It,"
p171
aVis positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself.
p172
aVWe have this tendency to think that only solid, material things
p173
aVare really things at all.
p174
aVWaves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal.
p175
aVVictorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium:
p176
aVthe ether.
p177
aVBut we find real matter comforting
p178
aVonly because we've evolved to survive in Middle World,
p179
aVwhere matter is a useful fiction.
p180
aVA whirlpool, for Steve Grand, is a thing with just as much reality
p181
aVas a rock.
p182
aa(lp183
VIn a desert plain in Tanzania,
p184
aVin the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai,
p185
aVthere's a dune made of volcanic ash.
p186
aVThe beautiful thing is that it moves bodily.
p187
aVIt's what's technically known as a "barchan,"
p188
aVand the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction
p189
aVat a speed of about 17 meters per year.
p190
aVIt retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns.
p191
aVWhat happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope
p192
aVon the other side,
p193
aVand then, as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge, it cascades down
p194
aVon the inside of the crescent,
p195
aVand so the whole horn-shaped dune moves.
p196
aVSteve Grand points out that you and I are, ourselves,
p197
aVmore like a wave than a permanent thing.
p198
aVHe invites us, the reader,
p199
aVto think of an experience from your childhood,
p200
aVsomething you remember clearly,
p201
aVsomething you can see, feel, maybe even smell,
p202
aVas if you were really there.
p203
aVAfter all, you really were there at the time, weren't you?
p204
aVHow else would you remember it?
p205
aVBut here is the bombshell: You weren't there.
p206
aVNot a single atom that is in your body today
p207
aVwas there when that event took place.
p208
aVMatter flows from place to place
p209
aVand momentarily comes together to be you.
p210
aVWhatever you are, therefore,
p211
aVyou are not the stuff of which you are made.
p212
aVIf that doesn't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck,
p213
aVread it again until it does, because it is important.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo "really" isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence.
p216
aVIf a neutrino had a brain,
p217
aVwhich it evolved in neutrino-sized ancestors,
p218
aVit would say that rocks really do consist of empty space.
p219
aVWe have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors
p220
aVwhich couldn't walk through rocks.
p221
aV"Really," for an animal, is whatever its brain needs it to be
p222
aVin order to assist its survival.
p223
aVAnd because different species live in different worlds,
p224
aVthere will be a discomforting variety of "reallys."
p225
aVWhat we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world,
p226
aVbut a model of the world, regulated and adjusted by sense data,
p227
aVbut constructed so it's useful for dealing with the real world.
p228
aa(lp229
VThe nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are.
p230
aVA flying animal needs a different kind of model
p231
aVfrom a walking, climbing or swimming animal.
p232
aVA monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating
p233
aVa three-dimensional world of branches and trunks.
p234
aVA mole's software for constructing models of its world will be customized
p235
aVfor underground use.
p236
aVA water strider's brain doesn't need 3D software at all,
p237
aVsince it lives on the surface of the pond,
p238
aVin an Edwin Abbott flatland.
p239
aa(lp240
VI've speculated that bats may see color with their ears.
p241
aVThe world model that a bat needs in order to navigate
p242
aVthrough three dimensions catching insects
p243
aVmust be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird \u2014
p244
aVa day-flying bird like a swallow \u2014 needs to perform the same kind of tasks.
p245
aVThe fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness
p246
aVto input the current variables to its model,
p247
aVwhile the swallow uses light, is incidental.
p248
aVBats, I've even suggested, use perceived hues, such as red and blue,
p249
aVas labels, internal labels, for some useful aspect of echoes \u2014
p250
aVperhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces, furry or smooth and so on \u2014
p251
aVin the same way as swallows or indeed, we, use those perceived hues \u2014
p252
aVredness and blueness, etc. \u2014
p253
aVto label long and short wavelengths of light.
p254
aVThere's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength.
p255
aa(lp256
VThe point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used,
p257
aVrather than by the sensory modality involved.
p258
aVJ.B.S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals
p259
aVwhose world is dominated by smell.
p260
aVDogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids, extremely diluted:
p261
aVcaprylic acid and caproic acid.
p262
aVThe only difference, you see,
p263
aVis that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain.
p264
aVHaldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids
p265
aVin the order of their molecular weights by their smells,
p266
aVjust as a man could place a number of piano wires
p267
aVin the order of their lengths by means of their notes.
p268
aVNow, there's another fatty acid, capric acid,
p269
aVwhich is just like the other two,
p270
aVexcept that it has two more carbon atoms.
p271
aVA dog that had never met capric acid would, perhaps,
p272
aVhave no more trouble imagining its smell
p273
aVthan we would have trouble imagining a trumpet, say,
p274
aVplaying one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before.
p275
aVPerhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color.
p276
aVAnd the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats.
p277
aa(lp278
VMiddle World \u2014 the range of sizes and speeds
p279
aVwhich we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with \u2014
p280
aVis a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum
p281
aVthat we see as light of various colors.
p282
aVWe're blind to all frequencies outside that,
p283
aVunless we use instruments to help us.
p284
aVMiddle World is the narrow range of reality
p285
aVwhich we judge to be normal, as opposed to the queerness
p286
aVof the very small, the very large and the very fast.
p287
aVWe could make a similar scale of improbabilities;
p288
aVnothing is totally impossible.
p289
aVMiracles are just events that are extremely improbable.
p290
aVA marble statue could wave its hand at us;
p291
aVthe atoms that make up its crystalline structure
p292
aVare all vibrating back and forth anyway.
p293
aVBecause there are so many of them,
p294
aVand because there's no agreement among them
p295
aVin their preferred direction of movement,
p296
aVthe marble, as we see it in Middle World, stays rock steady.
p297
aVBut the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move
p298
aVthe same way at the same time, and again and again.
p299
aVIn this case, the hand would move,
p300
aVand we'd see it waving at us in Middle World.
p301
aVThe odds against it, of course, are so great
p302
aVthat if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe,
p303
aVyou still would not have written enough zeros to this day.
p304
aa(lp305
VEvolution in Middle World has not equipped us
p306
aVto handle very improbable events; we don't live long enough.
p307
aVIn the vastness of astronomical space and geological time,
p308
aVthat which seems impossible in Middle World
p309
aVmight turn out to be inevitable.
p310
aVOne way to think about that is by counting planets.
p311
aVWe don't know how many planets there are in the universe,
p312
aVbut a good estimate is about 10 to the 20, or 100 billion billion.
p313
aVAnd that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life's improbability.
p314
aVWe could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability,
p315
aVwhich might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at.
p316
aa(lp317
VIf life has arisen only once on any \u2014
p318
aVlife could originate once per planet, could be extremely common
p319
aVor it could originate once per star
p320
aVor once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe,
p321
aVin which case it would have to be here.
p322
aVAnd somewhere up there would be the chance
p323
aVthat a frog would turn into a prince,
p324
aVand similar magical things like that.
p325
aVIf life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe,
p326
aVthat planet has to be our planet, because here we are talking about it.
p327
aVAnd that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it,
p328
aVwe're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life
p329
aVwhich have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion.
p330
aVI don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that,
p331
aVbecause I suspect that life is quite common in the universe.
p332
aVAnd when I say quite common, it could still be so rare
p333
aVthat no one island of life ever encounters another,
p334
aVwhich is a sad thought.
p335
aa(lp336
VHow shall we interpret "queerer than we can suppose?"
p337
aVQueerer than can in principle be supposed,
p338
aVor just queerer than we can suppose, given the limitations
p339
aVof our brain's evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World?
p340
aVCould we, by training and practice,
p341
aVemancipate ourselves from Middle World
p342
aVand achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding
p343
aVof the very small and the very large?
p344
aVI genuinely don't know the answer.
p345
aVI wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand, say, quantum theory,
p346
aVif we brought up children to play computer games
p347
aVbeginning in early childhood,
p348
aVwhich had a make-believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen,
p349
aVa world in which the strange goings-on of quantum mechanics were enlarged
p350
aVby the computer's make-believe,
p351
aVso that they became familiar on the Middle-World scale of the stream.
p352
aVAnd similarly, a relativistic computer game,
p353
aVin which objects on the screen manifest the Lorentz contraction, and so on,
p354
aVto try to get ourselves \u2014 to get children into the way of thinking about it.
p355
aa(lp356
VI want to end by applying the idea of Middle World
p357
aVto our perceptions of each other.
p358
aVMost scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind:
p359
aVwe're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are,
p360
aVour hormones are the way they are.
p361
aVWe'd be different, our characters would be different,
p362
aVif our neuro-anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different.
p363
aVBut we scientists are inconsistent.
p364
aVIf we were consistent,
p365
aVour response to a misbehaving person, like a child-murderer,
p366
aVshould be something like:
p367
aVthis unit has a faulty component; it needs repairing.
p368
aVThat's not what we say.
p369
aVWhat we say \u2014 and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us,
p370
aVwhich is probably me \u2014
p371
aVwhat we say is, "Vile monster, prison is too good for you."
p372
aVOr worse, we seek revenge, in all probability thereby triggering
p373
aVthe next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge,
p374
aVwhich we see, of course, all over the world today.
p375
aVIn short, when we're thinking like academics,
p376
aVwe regard people as elaborate and complicated machines,
p377
aVlike computers or cars.
p378
aVBut when we revert to being human,
p379
aVwe behave more like Basil Fawlty, who, we remember,
p380
aVthrashed his car to teach it a lesson,
p381
aVwhen it wouldn't start on "Gourmet Night."
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
VThe reason we personify things like cars and computers
p386
aVis that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world
p387
aVand moles live in an underground world
p388
aVand water striders live in a surface tension-dominated flatland,
p389
aVwe live in a social world.
p390
aVWe swim through a sea of people \u2014
p391
aVa social version of Middle World.
p392
aVWe are evolved to second-guess the behavior of others
p393
aVby becoming brilliant, intuitive psychologists.
p394
aVTreating people as machines
p395
aVmay be scientifically and philosophically accurate,
p396
aVbut it's a cumbersome waste of time
p397
aVif you want to guess what this person is going to do next.
p398
aVThe economically useful way to model a person
p399
aVis to treat him as a purposeful, goal-seeking agent
p400
aVwith pleasures and pains, desires and intentions,
p401
aVguilt, blame-worthiness.
p402
aVPersonification and the imputing of intentional purpose
p403
aVis such a brilliantly successful way to model humans,
p404
aVit's hardly surprising the same modeling software
p405
aVoften seizes control when we're trying to think about entities
p406
aVfor which it's not appropriate, like Basil Fawlty with his car
p407
aVor like millions of deluded people, with the universe as a whole.
p408
aa(lp409
V(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VIf the universe is queerer than we can suppose,
p412
aVis it just because we've been naturally selected
p413
aVto suppose only what we needed to suppose
p414
aVin order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa?
p415
aVOr are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves
p416
aVto break out of the box of our evolution?
p417
aVOr finally, are there some things in the universe so queer
p418
aVthat no philosophy of beings, however godlike, could dream them?
p419
aa(lp420
VThank you very much.

VSo, we used to solve big problems.
p5
aVOn July 21st, 1969,
p6
aVBuzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module
p7
aVand descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.
p8
aVArmstrong and Aldrin were alone,
p9
aVbut their presence on the moon's gray surface
p10
aVwas the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe Apollo program was the greatest
p13
aVpeacetime mobilization
p14
aVin the history of the United States.
p15
aVTo get to the moon, NASA spent
p16
aVaround 180 billion dollars in today's money,
p17
aVor four percent of the federal budget.
p18
aVApollo employed around 400,000 people
p19
aVand demanded the collaboration of 20,000
p20
aVcompanies, universities and government agencies.
p21
aVPeople died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
p22
aVBut before the Apollo program ended,
p23
aV24 men flew to the moon.
p24
aVTwelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin,
p25
aVfollowing the death of Armstrong last year,
p26
aVis now the most senior.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo why did they go?
p29
aVThey didn't bring much back:
p30
aV841 pounds of old rocks,
p31
aVand something all 24 later emphasized \u2014
p32
aVa new sense of the smallness
p33
aVand the fragility of our common home.
p34
aVWhy did they go? The cynical answer is they went
p35
aVbecause President Kennedy wanted to show
p36
aVthe Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.
p37
aVBut Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962
p38
aVprovide a better clue.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Video) John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon?
p41
aVWhy choose this as our goal?
p42
aVAnd they may well ask,
p43
aVwhy climb the highest mountain?
p44
aVWhy, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?
p45
aVWhy does Rice play Texas?
p46
aVWe choose to go to the moon.
p47
aVWe choose to go to the moon.
p48
aV(Applause)
p49
aVWe choose to go to the moon in this decade,
p50
aVand do the other things,
p51
aVnot because they are easy, but because they are hard.
p52
aa(lp53
VJason Pontin: To contemporaries,
p54
aVApollo wasn't only a victory of West over East
p55
aVin the Cold War.
p56
aVAt the time, the strongest emotion
p57
aVwas of wonder
p58
aVat the transcendent powers of technology.
p59
aVThey went because it was a big thing to do.
p60
aVLanding on the moon occurred in the context
p61
aVof a long series of technological triumphs.
p62
aVThe first half of the 20th century produced
p63
aVthe assembly line and the airplane,
p64
aVpenicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.
p65
aVIn the middle years of the century,
p66
aVpolio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.
p67
aVTechnology itself seemed to possess
p68
aVwhat Alvin Toffler in 1970
p69
aVcalled "accelerative thrust."
p70
aVFor most of human history,
p71
aVwe could go no faster than a horse
p72
aVor a boat with a sail,
p73
aVbut in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10
p74
aVflew at 25,000 miles an hour.
p75
aa(lp76
VSince 1970, no human beings
p77
aVhave been back to the moon.
p78
aVNo one has traveled faster than the crew
p79
aVof Apollo 10,
p80
aVand blithe optimism about technology's powers
p81
aVhas evaporated
p82
aVas big problems we had imagined technology would solve,
p83
aVsuch as going to Mars,
p84
aVcreating clean energy, curing cancer,
p85
aVor feeding the world have come to seem
p86
aVintractably hard.
p87
aa(lp88
VI remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.
p89
aVI was five years old,
p90
aVand my mother told me not to stare
p91
aVat the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.
p92
aVI vaguely knew this was to be the last
p93
aVof the moon missions,
p94
aVbut I was absolutely certain there would be
p95
aVMars colonies in my lifetime.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo "Something happened
p98
aVto our capacity to solve big problems with technology"
p99
aVhas become a commonplace.
p100
aVYou hear it all the time.
p101
aVWe've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
p102
aVIt feels as if technologists have diverted us
p103
aVand enriched themselves with trivial toys,
p104
aVwith things like iPhones and apps and social media,
p105
aVor algorithms that speed automated trading.
p106
aVThere's nothing wrong with most of these things.
p107
aVThey've expanded and enriched our lives.
p108
aVBut they don't solve humanity's big problems.
p109
aa(lp110
VWhat happened?
p111
aVSo there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley,
p112
aVwhich admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies
p113
aVthan it did in the years when it financed
p114
aVIntel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.
p115
aVSilicon Valley says the markets are to blame,
p116
aVin particular the incentives that venture capitalists
p117
aVoffer to entrepreneurs.
p118
aVSilicon Valley says that venture investing
p119
aVshifted away from funding transformational ideas
p120
aVand towards funding incremental problems
p121
aVor even fake problems.
p122
aVBut I don't think that explanation is good enough.
p123
aVIt mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
p124
aVEven when venture capitalists were at their most
p125
aVrisk-happy, they preferred small investments,
p126
aVtiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.
p127
aVV.C.s have always struggled
p128
aVto invest profitably in technologies such as energy
p129
aVwhose capital requirements are huge
p130
aVand whose development is long and lengthy,
p131
aVand V.C.s have never, never funded the development
p132
aVof technologies meant to solve big problems
p133
aVthat possess no immediate commercial value.
p134
aVNo, the reasons we can't solve big problems
p135
aVare more complicated and more profound.
p136
aa(lp137
VSometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
p138
aVWe could go to Mars if we want.
p139
aVNASA even has the outline of a plan.
p140
aVBut going to Mars would follow a political decision
p141
aVwith popular appeal, and that will never happen.
p142
aVWe won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks
p143
aVthere are more important things
p144
aVto do here on Earth.
p145
aa(lp146
VSometimes, we can't solve big problems
p147
aVbecause our political systems fail.
p148
aVToday, less than two percent
p149
aVof the world's energy consumption
p150
aVderives from advanced, renewable sources
p151
aVsuch as solar, wind and biofuels,
p152
aVless than two percent,
p153
aVand the reason is purely economic.
p154
aVCoal and natural gas are cheaper
p155
aVthan solar and wind,
p156
aVand petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.
p157
aVWe want alternative energy sources
p158
aVthat can compete on price. None exist.
p159
aVNow, technologists, business leaders
p160
aVand economists all basically agree
p161
aVon what national policies and international treaties
p162
aVwould spur the development of alternative energy:
p163
aVmostly, a significant increase in energy
p164
aVresearch and development,
p165
aVand some kind of price on carbon.
p166
aVBut there's no hope in the present political climate
p167
aVthat we will see U.S. energy policy
p168
aVor international treaties that reflect that consensus.
p169
aa(lp170
VSometimes, big problems that had seemed technological
p171
aVturn out not to be so.
p172
aVFamines were long understood to be caused
p173
aVby failures in food supply.
p174
aVBut 30 years of research have taught us
p175
aVthat famines are political crises
p176
aVthat catastrophically affect food distribution.
p177
aVTechnology can improve things like crop yields
p178
aVor systems for storing and transporting food,
p179
aVbut there will be famines so long as there are bad governments.
p180
aa(lp181
VFinally, big problems sometimes elude solution
p182
aVbecause we don't really understand the problem.
p183
aVPresident Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971,
p184
aVbut we soon discovered
p185
aVthere are many kinds of cancer,
p186
aVmost of them fiendishly resistant to therapy,
p187
aVand it is only in the last 10 years
p188
aVthat effective, viable therapies
p189
aVhave come to seem real.
p190
aVHard problems are hard.
p191
aa(lp192
VIt's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.
p193
aVWe can, we must, but these four elements
p194
aVmust all be present:
p195
aVPolitical leaders and the public
p196
aVmust care to solve a problem;
p197
aVinstitutions must support its solution;
p198
aVIt must really be a technological problem;
p199
aVand we must understand it.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe Apollo mission,
p202
aVwhich has become a kind of metaphor
p203
aVfor technology's capacity to solve big problems,
p204
aVmet these criteria.
p205
aVBut it is an irreproducible model for the future.
p206
aVIt is not 1961.
p207
aVThere is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War,
p208
aVno politician like John Kennedy
p209
aVwho can heroize the difficult and the dangerous,
p210
aVand no popular science fictional mythology
p211
aVsuch as exploring the solar system.
p212
aVMost of all, going to the moon
p213
aVturned out to be easy.
p214
aVIt was just three days away.
p215
aVAnd arguably it wasn't even solving
p216
aVmuch of a problem.
p217
aa(lp218
VWe are left alone with our day,
p219
aVand the solutions of the future will be harder won.
p220
aVGod knows, we don't lack for the challenges.
p221
aa(lp222
VThank you very much.

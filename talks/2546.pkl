VThis is a man-made forest.
p5
aVIt can spread over acres and acres of area,
p6
aVor it could fit in a small space \u2014
p7
aVas small as your house garden.
p8
aVEach of these forests is just two years old.
p9
aVI have a forest in the backyard of my own house.
p10
aVIt attracts a lot of biodiversity.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Bird call)
p13
aa(lp14
VI wake up to this every morning,
p15
aVlike a Disney princess.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VI am an entrepreneur
p20
aVwho facilitates the making of these forests professionally.
p21
aVWe have helped factories,
p22
aVfarms,
p23
aVschools,
p24
aVhomes,
p25
aVresorts,
p26
aVapartment buildings,
p27
aVpublic parks
p28
aVand even a zoo
p29
aVto have one of such forests.
p30
aVA forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together.
p31
aVA forest can be an integral part of our urban existence.
p32
aVA forest, for me,
p33
aVis a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it.
p34
aVIt doesn't matter how big or small they are.
p35
aa(lp36
VMost of the world we live in today was forest.
p37
aVThis was before human intervention.
p38
aVThen we built up our cities on those forests,
p39
aVlike São Paulo,
p40
aVforgetting that we belong to nature as well,
p41
aVas much as 8.4 million other species on the planet.
p42
aVOur habitat stopped being our natural habitat.
p43
aVBut not anymore for some of us.
p44
aVA few others and I today make these forests professionally \u2014
p45
aVanywhere and everywhere.
p46
aa(lp47
VI'm an industrial engineer.
p48
aVI specialize in making cars.
p49
aVIn my previous job at Toyota,
p50
aVI learned how to convert natural resources into products.
p51
aVTo give you an example,
p52
aVwe would drip the sap out of a rubber tree,
p53
aVconvert it into raw rubber
p54
aVand make a tire out of it \u2014 the product.
p55
aVBut these products can never become a natural resource again.
p56
aVWe separate the elements from nature
p57
aVand convert them into an irreversible state.
p58
aVThat's industrial production.
p59
aa(lp60
VNature, on the other hand, works in a totally opposite way.
p61
aVThe natural system produces by bringing elements together,
p62
aVatom by atom.
p63
aVAll the natural products become a natural resource again.
p64
aVThis is something which I learned
p65
aVwhen I made a forest in the backyard of my own house.
p66
aVAnd this was the first time I worked with nature,
p67
aVrather than against it.
p68
aVSince then,
p69
aVwe have made 75 such forests in 25 cities across the world.
p70
aVEvery time we work at a new place,
p71
aVwe find that every single element needed to make a forest
p72
aVis available right around us.
p73
aVAll we have to do is to bring these elements together
p74
aVand let nature take over.
p75
aa(lp76
VTo make a forest we start with soil.
p77
aVWe touch, feel and even taste it
p78
aVto identify what properties it lacks.
p79
aVIf the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact \u2014
p80
aVso compact, that water cannot seep in.
p81
aVWe mix some local biomass available around,
p82
aVwhich can help soil become more porous.
p83
aVWater can now seep in.
p84
aVIf the soil doesn't have the capacity to hold water,
p85
aVwe will mix some more biomass \u2014
p86
aVsome water-absorbent material like peat or bagasse,
p87
aVso soil can hold this water and it stays moist.
p88
aa(lp89
VTo grow, plants need water, sunlight and nutrition.
p90
aVWhat if the soil doesn't have any nutrition in it?
p91
aVWe don't just add nutrition directly to the soil.
p92
aVThat would be the industrial way.
p93
aVIt goes against nature.
p94
aVWe instead add microorganisms to the soil.
p95
aVThey produce the nutrients in the soil naturally.
p96
aVThey feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil,
p97
aVso all they have to do is eat and multiply.
p98
aVAnd as their number grows,
p99
aVthe soil starts breathing again.
p100
aVIt becomes alive.
p101
aa(lp102
VWe survey the native tree species of the place.
p103
aVHow do we decide what's native or not?
p104
aVWell, whatever existed before human intervention is native.
p105
aVThat's the simple rule.
p106
aVWe survey a national park
p107
aVto find the last remains of a natural forest.
p108
aVWe survey the sacred groves,
p109
aVor sacred forests around old temples.
p110
aVAnd if we don't find anything at all,
p111
aVwe go to museums
p112
aVto see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago.
p113
aVWe research old paintings, poems and literature from the place,
p114
aVto identify the tree species belonging there.
p115
aa(lp116
VOnce we know our trees,
p117
aVwe divide them in four different layers:
p118
aVshrub layer, sub-tree layer, tree layer and canopy layer.
p119
aVWe fix the ratios of each layer,
p120
aVand then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix.
p121
aVIf we are making a fruit forest,
p122
aVwe increase the percentage of fruit-bearing trees.
p123
aVIt could be a flowering forest,
p124
aVa forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees,
p125
aVor it could simply be a native, wild evergreen forest.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them.
p128
aVWe make sure that trees belonging to the same layer
p129
aVare not planted next to each other,
p130
aVor they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall.
p131
aVWe plant the saplings close to each other.
p132
aVOn the surface, we spread a thick layer of mulch,
p133
aVso when it's hot outside the soil stays moist.
p134
aVWhen it's cold,
p135
aVfrost formation happens only on the mulch,
p136
aVso soil can still breathe while it's freezing outside.
p137
aVThe soil is very soft \u2014
p138
aVso soft, that roots can penetrate into it easily,
p139
aVrapidly.
p140
aa(lp141
VInitially, the forest doesn't seem like it's growing,
p142
aVbut it's growing under the surface.
p143
aVIn the first three months,
p144
aVroots reach a depth of one meter.
p145
aVThese roots form a mesh,
p146
aVtightly holding the soil.
p147
aVMicrobes and fungi live throughout this network of roots.
p148
aVSo if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree,
p149
aVthese microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree.
p150
aVWhenever it rains,
p151
aVmagically,
p152
aVmushrooms appear overnight.
p153
aVAnd this means the soil below has a healthy fungal network.
p154
aa(lp155
VOnce these roots are established,
p156
aVforest starts growing on the surface.
p157
aVAs the forest grows we keep watering it \u2014
p158
aVfor the next two to three years, we water the forest.
p159
aVWe want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees,
p160
aVso we remove the weeds growing on the ground.
p161
aVAs this forest grows, it blocks the sunlight.
p162
aVEventually, the forest becomes so dense
p163
aVthat sunlight can't reach the ground anymore.
p164
aVWeeds cannot grow now, because they need sunlight as well.
p165
aa(lp166
VAt this stage,
p167
aVevery single drop of water that falls into the forest
p168
aVdoesn't evaporate back into the atmosphere.
p169
aVThis dense forest condenses the moist air
p170
aVand retains its moisture.
p171
aVWe gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest.
p172
aVAnd even without watering,
p173
aVthe forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark.
p174
aVNow, when a single leaf falls on this forest floor,
p175
aVit immediately starts decaying.
p176
aVThis decayed biomass forms humus,
p177
aVwhich is food for the forest.
p178
aVAs the forest grows,
p179
aVmore leaves fall on the surface \u2014
p180
aVit means more humus is produced,
p181
aVit means more food so the forest can grow still bigger.
p182
aVAnd this forest keeps growing exponentially.
p183
aa(lp184
VOnce established,
p185
aVthese forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again \u2014
p186
aVprobably forever.
p187
aVIn a natural forest like this,
p188
aVno management is the best management.
p189
aVIt's a tiny jungle party.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VThis forest grows as a collective.
p194
aVIf the same trees \u2014
p195
aVsame species \u2014
p196
aVwould have been planted independently,
p197
aVit wouldn't grow so fast.
p198
aVAnd this is how we create a 100-year-old forest
p199
aVin just 10 years.
p200
aa(lp201
VThank you very much.

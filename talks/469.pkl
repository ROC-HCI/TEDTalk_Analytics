VI'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers
p5
aVthat worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.
p6
aVAnd along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo I want to show you a clip of the film now.
p9
aVHopefully it won't stutter.
p10
aVAnd if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved.
p11
aa(lp12
VVoice (Video): I don't know how it's possible ...
p13
aVbut you seem to have more hair.
p14
aa(lp15
VBrad Pitt: What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ...
p16
aVbut I was getting younger than everybody else?
p17
aa(lp18
VI was born with some form of disease.
p19
aa(lp20
VVoice: What kind of disease?
p21
aa(lp22
VBP: I was born old.
p23
aa(lp24
VMan: I'm sorry.
p25
aa(lp26
VBP: No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age.
p27
aa(lp28
VGirl: Are you sick?
p29
aa(lp30
VBP: I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,
p31
aVand they said I was gonna die soon.
p32
aVBut ... maybe not.
p33
aa(lp34
VGirl: You're different than anybody I've ever met.
p35
aa(lp36
VBB: There were many changes ...
p37
aVsome you could see, some you couldn't.
p38
aVHair started growing in all sorts of places,
p39
aValong with other things.
p40
aVI felt pretty good, considering.
p41
aa(lp42
VEd Ulbrich: That was a clip from "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."
p43
aVMany of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story,
p44
aVbut what you might not know
p45
aVis that for nearly the first hour of the film,
p46
aVthe main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt,
p47
aVis completely computer-generated from the neck up.
p48
aVNow, there's no use of prosthetic makeup
p49
aVor photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body.
p50
aVWe've created a completely digital human head.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.
p53
aVThis is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.
p54
aVIt's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.
p55
aVNow, this movie has floated around Hollywood
p56
aVfor well over half a century,
p57
aVand we first got involved with the project in the early '90s,
p58
aVwith Ron Howard as the director.
p59
aVWe took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.
p60
aVBut at the time we had to throw in the towel.
p61
aVIt was deemed impossible.
p62
aVIt was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.
p63
aVThe human form, in particular the human head,
p64
aVhas been considered the Holy Grail of our industry.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe project came back to us about a decade later,
p67
aVand this time with a director named David Fincher.
p68
aVNow, Fincher is an interesting guy.
p69
aVDavid is fearless of technology,
p70
aVand he is absolutely tenacious.
p71
aVAnd David won't take "no."
p72
aVAnd David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry,
p73
aVthat anything is possible
p74
aVas long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money.
p75
aVAnd so David had an interesting take on the film,
p76
aVand he threw a challenge at us.
p77
aVHe wanted the main character of the film to be played
p78
aVfrom the cradle to the grave by one actor.
p79
aVIt happened to be this guy.
p80
aa(lp81
VWe went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery
p82
aVwith David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors.
p83
aVThat was one idea: that we would have different actors,
p84
aVand we would hand off from actor to actor.
p85
aa(lp86
VWe even ruled out the idea of using makeup.
p87
aVWe realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up,
p88
aVparticularly in close-up.
p89
aVAnd makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up.
p90
aVAnd David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face
p91
aVto bring the aging to this character.
p92
aVHe needed to be a very sympathetic character.
p93
aVSo we decided to cast a series of little people
p94
aVthat would play the different bodies of Benjamin
p95
aVat the different increments of his life
p96
aVand that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head,
p97
aVaged to appear as Benjamin,
p98
aVand attach that to the body of the real actor.
p99
aVSounded great.
p100
aa(lp101
VOf course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry,
p102
aVand the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either,
p103
aVbecause I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store,
p104
aVyou know \u2014 we see his face constantly.
p105
aVSo there really was no tolerable margin of error.
p106
aVThere were two studios involved: Warner Brothers and Paramount.
p107
aVAnd they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course,
p108
aVbut it was a very high-risk proposition.
p109
aVThere was lots of money and reputations at stake.
p110
aVBut we believed that we had a very solid methodology
p111
aVthat might work ...
p112
aa(lp113
VBut despite our verbal assurances,
p114
aVthey wanted some proof.
p115
aVAnd so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin.
p116
aVAnd we did it in about five weeks.
p117
aVBut we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.
p118
aVWe basically put something together to get through the meeting.
p119
aVI'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button.
p120
aVAnd in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head \u2014
p121
aVpretty good \u2014 attached to the body of an actor.
p122
aVAnd it worked. And it gave the studio great relief.
p123
aVAfter many years of starts and stops on this project,
p124
aVand making that tough decision,
p125
aVthey finally decided to greenlight the movie.
p126
aVAnd I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us,
p127
aVto say the movie was a go,
p128
aVI actually threw up.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVYou know, this is some tough stuff.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo we started to have early team meetings,
p133
aVand we got everybody together,
p134
aVand it was really more like therapy in the beginning,
p135
aVconvincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.
p136
aVWe had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.
p137
aVAnd it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.
p138
aVWe really felt like we were in a \u2014 kind of a 12-step program.
p139
aVAnd of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem. (Laughter)
p140
aVSo we had a big problem:
p141
aVwe didn't know how we were going to do this.
p142
aVBut we did know one thing.
p143
aVBeing from the visual effects industry,
p144
aVwe, with David, believed that we now had enough time,
p145
aVenough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money.
p146
aVAnd we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo, when you're faced with something like that,
p149
aVof course you've got to break it down.
p150
aVYou take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces
p151
aVand you start to attack that.
p152
aVSo we had three main areas that we had to focus on.
p153
aVWe needed to make Brad look a lot older \u2014
p154
aVneeded to age him 45 years or so.
p155
aVAnd we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies,
p156
aVhis little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is
p157
aVand have that translate through our process
p158
aVso that it appears in Benjamin on the screen.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd we also needed to create a character
p161
aVthat could hold up under, really, all conditions.
p162
aVHe needed to be able to walk in broad daylight,
p163
aVat nighttime, under candlelight,
p164
aVhe had to hold an extreme close-up,
p165
aVhe had to deliver dialogue,
p166
aVhe had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat,
p167
aVhe had to be able to take a bath, to cry,
p168
aVhe even had to throw up.
p169
aVNot all at the same time \u2014
p170
aVbut he had to, you know, do all of those things.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.
p173
aVWe did about 325 shots.
p174
aVSo we needed a system that would allow Benjamin
p175
aVto do everything a human being can do.
p176
aVAnd we realized that there was a giant chasm
p177
aVbetween the state of the art of technology in 2004
p178
aVand where we needed it to be.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo we focused on motion capture.
p181
aVI'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.
p182
aVThe state of the art at the time
p183
aVwas something called marker-based motion capture.
p184
aVI'll give you an example here.
p185
aVIt's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard,
p186
aVand they put some reflective markers on your body,
p187
aVand instead of using cameras,
p188
aVthere're infrared sensors around a volume,
p189
aVand those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position
p190
aVof those markers in real time.
p191
aVAnd then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers
p192
aVand apply them to a computer-generated character.
p193
aVYou can see the computer characters on the right
p194
aVare having the same complex motion as the dancers.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut we also looked at numbers of other films at the time
p197
aVthat were using facial marker tracking,
p198
aVand that's the idea of putting markers on the human face
p199
aVand doing the same process.
p200
aVAnd as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance.
p201
aVThat's not terribly compelling.
p202
aVAnd what we realized
p203
aVwas that what we needed
p204
aVwas the information that was going on between the markers.
p205
aVWe needed the subtleties of the skin.
p206
aVWe needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.
p207
aVWe needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.
p208
aa(lp209
VOur first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from
p210
aVthe technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art.
p211
aVSo we aborted using motion capture.
p212
aVAnd we were now well out of our comfort zone,
p213
aVand in uncharted territory.
p214
aVSo we were left with this idea
p215
aVthat we ended up calling "technology stew."
p216
aVWe started to look out in other fields.
p217
aVThe idea was that we were going to find
p218
aVnuggets or gems of technology
p219
aVthat come from other industries like medical imaging,
p220
aVthe video game space,
p221
aVand re-appropriate them.
p222
aVAnd we had to create kind of a sauce.
p223
aVAnd the sauce was code in software
p224
aVthat we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology
p225
aVto come together and work as one.
p226
aa(lp227
VInitially, we came across some remarkable research
p228
aVdone by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s.
p229
aVHe believed that he could, in fact,
p230
aVcatalog the human face.
p231
aVAnd he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS.
p232
aVHe believed that there were 70 basic poses
p233
aVor shapes of the human face,
p234
aVand that those basic poses or shapes of the face
p235
aVcan be combined to create infinite possibilities
p236
aVof everything the human face is capable of doing.
p237
aVAnd of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender.
p238
aVSo this became the foundation of our research as we went forward.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd then we came across some remarkable technology
p241
aVcalled Contour.
p242
aVAnd here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup
p243
aVstippled on her face.
p244
aVAnd now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture
p245
aVas opposed to a marker capture.
p246
aVThe subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras,
p247
aVand those cameras can, frame-by-frame,
p248
aVreconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment.
p249
aVSo, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject.
p250
aVAnd if you look in a comparison,
p251
aVon the left, we see what volumetric data gives us
p252
aVand on the right you see what markers give us.
p253
aVSo, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this.
p254
aVBut these were the early days of this technology,
p255
aVand it wasn't really proven yet.
p256
aVWe measure complexity and fidelity of data
p257
aVin terms of polygonal count.
p258
aVAnd so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons.
p259
aVWe could go up into the millions of polygons.
p260
aVIt seemed to be infinite.
p261
aa(lp262
VThis was when we had our "Aha!"
p263
aVThis was the breakthrough.
p264
aVThis is when we're like, "OK, we're going to be OK,
p265
aVThis is actually going to work."
p266
aVAnd the "Aha!" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt,
p267
aVand we could put Brad in this device,
p268
aVand use this Contour process,
p269
aVand we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup
p270
aVand put him under the black lights,
p271
aVand we could, in fact, scan him in real time
p272
aVperforming Ekman's FACS poses.
p273
aVRight? So, effectively,
p274
aVwe ended up with a 3D database
p275
aVof everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing.
p276
aV(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VFrom there, we actually carved up those faces
p279
aVinto smaller pieces and components of his face.
p280
aVSo we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes,
p281
aVa complete database of all possibilities
p282
aVthat his face is capable of doing.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, that's great, except we had him at age 44.
p285
aVWe need to put another 40 years on him at this point.
p286
aVWe brought in Rick Baker,
p287
aVand Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus
p288
aVof our industry.
p289
aVAnd we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji,
p290
aVand Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time.
p291
aVAnd we commissioned them to make a maquette,
p292
aVor a bust, of Benjamin.
p293
aVSo, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" \u2014 I had to do this \u2014
p294
aVI had to unveil something.
p295
aVSo this is Ben 80.
p296
aVWe created three of these:
p297
aVthere's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60.
p298
aVAnd this really became the template for moving forward.
p299
aa(lp300
VNow, this was made from a life cast of Brad.
p301
aVSo, in fact, anatomically, it is correct.
p302
aVThe eyes, the jaw, the teeth:
p303
aVeverything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has.
p304
aVWe have these maquettes scanned into the computer
p305
aVat very high resolution \u2014
p306
aVenormous polygonal count.
p307
aVAnd so now we had three age increments of Benjamin
p308
aVin the computer.
p309
aa(lp310
VBut we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.
p311
aVWe went through this process, then, called retargeting.
p312
aVThis is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.
p313
aVAnd here's the resulting data that comes from that,
p314
aVthe model that comes from that.
p315
aVRetargeting is the process of transposing that data
p316
aVonto another model.
p317
aVAnd because the life cast, or the bust \u2014 the maquette \u2014 of Benjamin
p318
aVwas made from Brad,
p319
aVwe could transpose the data of Brad at 44
p320
aVonto Brad at 87.
p321
aVSo now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do
p322
aVat age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s.
p323
aa(lp324
VNext we had to go into the shooting process.
p325
aVSo while all that's going on,
p326
aVwe're down in New Orleans and locations around the world.
p327
aVAnd we shot our body actors,
p328
aVand we shot them wearing blue hoods.
p329
aVSo these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.
p330
aVAnd the blue hoods helped us with two things:
p331
aVone, we could easily erase their heads;
p332
aVand we also put tracking markers on their heads
p333
aVso we could recreate the camera motion
p334
aVand the lens optics from the set.
p335
aa(lp336
VBut now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.
p337
aVAnd so we edited the footage that was shot on location
p338
aVwith the rest of the cast and the body actors
p339
aVand about six months later
p340
aVwe brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles
p341
aVand he watched on the screen.
p342
aVHis job, then, was to become Benjamin.
p343
aVAnd so we looped the scenes.
p344
aVHe watched again and again.
p345
aVWe encouraged him to improvise.
p346
aVAnd he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places
p347
aVthat we didn't think he was going to go.
p348
aVWe shot him with four HD cameras
p349
aVso we'd get multiple views of him
p350
aVand then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin
p351
aVthat he thought best matched the footage
p352
aVwith the rest of the cast.
p353
aa(lp354
VFrom there we went into a process called image analysis.
p355
aVAnd so here, you can see again, the chosen take.
p356
aVAnd you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87.
p357
aVAnd so, what's interesting about this is
p358
aVwe used something called image analysis,
p359
aVwhich is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face.
p360
aVAnd so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow.
p361
aVAnd the software would tell us that, well,
p362
aVin frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here,
p363
aVand it concludes moving in frame 32.
p364
aVAnd so we could choose numbers of positions on the face
p365
aVto pull that data from.
p366
aa(lp367
VAnd then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew \u2014
p368
aVthat secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to
p369
aVmatch the performance footage of Brad
p370
aVin live action with our database of aged Benjamin,
p371
aVthe FACS shapes that we had.
p372
aVOn a frame-by-frame basis,
p373
aVwe could actually reconstruct a 3D head
p374
aVthat exactly matched the performance of Brad.
p375
aa(lp376
VSo this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.
p377
aVAnd here you can see the body actor.
p378
aVAnd then this is what we called the "dead head," no reference to Jerry Garcia.
p379
aa(lp380
VAnd then here's the reconstructed performance
p381
aVnow with the timings of the performance.
p382
aVAnd then, again, the final shot.
p383
aVIt was a long process.
p384
aV(Applause)
p385
aa(lp386
VThe next section here, I'm going to just blast through this,
p387
aVbecause we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides.
p388
aa(lp389
VWe had to create a lighting system.
p390
aVSo really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment
p391
aVfor every single location that Benjamin had to appear
p392
aVso that we could put Ben's head into any scene
p393
aVand it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors
p394
aVin the real world.
p395
aa(lp396
VWe also had to create an eye system.
p397
aVWe found the old adage, you know,
p398
aV"The eyes are the window to the soul,"
p399
aVabsolutely true.
p400
aVSo the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.
p401
aVAnd if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity,
p402
aVand feel his intent coming through the eyes,
p403
aVthen we would succeed.
p404
aVSo we had one person focused on the eye system
p405
aVfor almost two full years.
p406
aa(lp407
VWe also had to create a mouth system.
p408
aVWe worked from dental molds of Brad.
p409
aVWe had to age the teeth over time.
p410
aa(lp411
VWe also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.
p412
aVThere was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.
p413
aVWe had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.
p414
aVHe was very popular.
p415
aa(lp416
VSkin displacement: another big deal.
p417
aVThe skin had to be absolutely accurate.
p418
aVHe's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home
p419
aVaround other old people,
p420
aVso he had to look exactly the same as the others.
p421
aVSo, lots of work on skin deformation,
p422
aVyou can see in some of these cases it works,
p423
aVin some cases it looks bad.
p424
aVThis is a very, very, very early test in our process.
p425
aVSo, effectively we created a digital puppet
p426
aVthat Brad Pitt could operate with his own face.
p427
aVThere were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior
p428
aVor enhance his performance.
p429
aa(lp430
VThere was something that we encountered, though,
p431
aVthat we ended up calling "the digital Botox effect."
p432
aVSo, as things went through this process,
p433
aVFincher would always say, "It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."
p434
aVAnd thing our process and the technology couldn't do,
p435
aVis they couldn't understand intent,
p436
aVthe intent of the actor.
p437
aVSo it sees a smile as a smile.
p438
aVIt doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile,
p439
aVor a frustrated smile.
p440
aVSo it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.
p441
aa(lp442
VBut we ended up calling the entire process

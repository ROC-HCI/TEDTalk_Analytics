VI didn't always love unintended consequences,
p5
aVbut I've really learned to appreciate them.
p6
aVI've learned that they're really the essence
p7
aVof what makes for progress,
p8
aVeven when they seem to be terrible.
p9
aVAnd I'd like to review
p10
aVjust how unintended consequences
p11
aVplay the part that they do.
p12
aa(lp13
VLet's go to 40,000 years before the present,
p14
aVto the time of the cultural explosion,
p15
aVwhen music, art, technology,
p16
aVso many of the things that we're enjoying today,
p17
aVso many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED
p18
aVwere born.
p19
aVAnd the anthropologist Randall White
p20
aVhas made a very interesting observation:
p21
aVthat if our ancestors
p22
aV40,000 years ago
p23
aVhad been able to see
p24
aVwhat they had done,
p25
aVthey wouldn't have really understood it.
p26
aVThey were responding
p27
aVto immediate concerns.
p28
aVThey were making it possible for us
p29
aVto do what they do,
p30
aVand yet, they didn't really understand
p31
aVhow they did it.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow let's advance to 10,000 years before the present.
p34
aVAnd this is when it really gets interesting.
p35
aVWhat about the domestication of grains?
p36
aVWhat about the origins of agriculture?
p37
aVWhat would our ancestors 10,000 years ago
p38
aVhave said
p39
aVif they really had technology assessment?
p40
aVAnd I could just imagine the committees
p41
aVreporting back to them
p42
aVon where agriculture was going to take humanity,
p43
aVat least in the next few hundred years.
p44
aVIt was really bad news.
p45
aVFirst of all, worse nutrition,
p46
aVmaybe shorter life spans.
p47
aVIt was simply awful for women.
p48
aVThe skeletal remains from that period
p49
aVhave shown that they were grinding grain morning, noon and night.
p50
aVAnd politically, it was awful.
p51
aVIt was the beginning of a much higher degree
p52
aVof inequality among people.
p53
aVIf there had been rational technology assessment then,
p54
aVI think they very well might have said,
p55
aV"Let's call the whole thing off."
p56
aa(lp57
VEven now, our choices are having unintended effects.
p58
aVHistorically, for example,
p59
aVchopsticks \u2014 according to one Japanese anthropologist
p60
aVwho wrote a dissertation about it
p61
aVat the University of Michigan \u2014
p62
aVresulted in long-term changes
p63
aVin the dentition, in the teeth,
p64
aVof the Japanese public.
p65
aVAnd we are also changing our teeth right now.
p66
aVThere is evidence
p67
aVthat the human mouth and teeth
p68
aVare growing smaller all the time.
p69
aVThat's not necessarily a bad unintended consequence.
p70
aVBut I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal,
p71
aVthere would have been a lot of disapproval
p72
aVof the wimpish choppers that we now have.
p73
aVSo these things are kind of relative
p74
aVto where you or your ancestors happen to stand.
p75
aa(lp76
VIn the ancient world
p77
aVthere was a lot of respect for unintended consequences,
p78
aVand there was a very healthy sense of caution,
p79
aVreflected in the Tree of Knowledge,
p80
aVin Pandora's Box,
p81
aVand especially in the myth of Prometheus
p82
aVthat's been so important
p83
aVin recent metaphors about technology.
p84
aVAnd that's all very true.
p85
aVThe physicians of the ancient world \u2014
p86
aVespecially the Egyptians,
p87
aVwho started medicine as we know it \u2014
p88
aVwere very conscious
p89
aVof what they could and couldn't treat.
p90
aVAnd the translations of the surviving texts say,
p91
aV"This I will not treat. This I cannot treat."
p92
aVThey were very conscious.
p93
aVSo were the followers of Hippocrates.
p94
aVThe Hippocratic manuscripts also \u2014
p95
aVrepeatedly, according to recent studies \u2014
p96
aVshow how important it is not to do harm.
p97
aVMore recently,
p98
aVHarvey Cushing,
p99
aVwho really developed neurosurgery as we know it,
p100
aVwho changed it from a field of medicine
p101
aVthat had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery
p102
aVto one in which there was a hopeful outlook,
p103
aVhe was very conscious
p104
aVthat he was not always going to do the right thing.
p105
aVBut he did his best,
p106
aVand he kept meticulous records
p107
aVthat let him transform that branch of medicine.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow if we look forward a bit
p110
aVto the 19th century,
p111
aVwe find a new style of technology.
p112
aVWhat we find is,
p113
aVno longer simple tools,
p114
aVbut systems.
p115
aVWe find more and more
p116
aVcomplex arrangements of machines
p117
aVthat make it harder and harder
p118
aVto diagnose what's going on.
p119
aVAnd the first people who saw that
p120
aVwere the telegraphers of the mid-19th century,
p121
aVwho were the original hackers.
p122
aVThomas Edison would have been very, very comfortable
p123
aVin the atmosphere of a software firm today.
p124
aVAnd these hackers had a word
p125
aVfor those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems
p126
aVthat they called bugs.
p127
aVThat was the origin of the word "bug."
p128
aVThis consciousness, though,
p129
aVwas a little slow to seep through the general population,
p130
aVeven people who were very, very well informed.
p131
aa(lp132
VSamuel Clemens, Mark Twain,
p133
aVwas a big investor
p134
aVin the most complex machine of all times \u2014
p135
aVat least until 1918 \u2014
p136
aVregistered with the U.S. Patent Office.
p137
aVThat was the Paige typesetter.
p138
aVThe Paige typesetter
p139
aVhad 18,000 parts.
p140
aVThe patent had 64 pages of text
p141
aVand 271 figures.
p142
aVIt was such a beautiful machine
p143
aVbecause it did everything that a human being did
p144
aVin setting type \u2014
p145
aVincluding returning the type to its place,
p146
aVwhich was a very difficult thing.
p147
aVAnd Mark Twain, who knew all about typesetting,
p148
aVreally was smitten by this machine.
p149
aVUnfortunately, he was smitten in more ways than one,
p150
aVbecause it made him bankrupt,
p151
aVand he had to tour the world speaking
p152
aVto recoup his money.
p153
aVAnd this was an important thing
p154
aVabout 19th century technology,
p155
aVthat all these relationships among parts
p156
aVcould make the most brilliant idea fall apart,
p157
aVeven when judged by the most expert people.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow there is something else, though, in the early 20th century
p160
aVthat made things even more complicated.
p161
aVAnd that was that safety technology itself
p162
aVcould be a source of danger.
p163
aVThe lesson of the Titanic, for a lot of the contemporaries,
p164
aVwas that you must have enough lifeboats
p165
aVfor everyone on the ship.
p166
aVAnd this was the result
p167
aVof the tragic loss of lives
p168
aVof people who could not get into them.
p169
aVHowever, there was another case, the Eastland,
p170
aVa ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915,
p171
aVand it killed 841 people \u2014
p172
aVthat was 14 more
p173
aVthan the passenger toll of the Titanic.
p174
aVThe reason for it, in part, was
p175
aVthe extra life boats that were added
p176
aVthat made this already unstable ship
p177
aVeven more unstable.
p178
aVAnd that again proves
p179
aVthat when you're talking about unintended consequences,
p180
aVit's not that easy to know
p181
aVthe right lessons to draw.
p182
aVIt's really a question of the system, how the ship was loaded,
p183
aVthe ballast and many other things.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo the 20th century, then,
p186
aVsaw how much more complex reality was,
p187
aVbut it also saw a positive side.
p188
aVIt saw that invention
p189
aVcould actually benefit from emergencies.
p190
aVIt could benefit
p191
aVfrom tragedies.
p192
aVAnd my favorite example of that \u2014
p193
aVwhich is not really widely known
p194
aVas a technological miracle,
p195
aVbut it may be one of the greatest of all times,
p196
aVwas the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War.
p197
aVPenicillin was discovered in 1928,
p198
aVbut even by 1940,
p199
aVno commercially and medically useful quantities of it
p200
aVwere being produced.
p201
aVA number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it.
p202
aVThey were working on it independently,
p203
aVand they weren't getting anywhere.
p204
aVAnd the Government Research Bureau
p205
aVbrought representatives together
p206
aVand told them that this is something
p207
aVthat has to be done.
p208
aVAnd not only did they do it,
p209
aVbut within two years,
p210
aVthey scaled up penicillin
p211
aVfrom preparation in one-liter flasks
p212
aVto 10,000-gallon vats.
p213
aVThat was how quickly penicillin was produced
p214
aVand became one of the greatest medical advances of all time.
p215
aVIn the Second World War, too,
p216
aVthe existence
p217
aVof solar radiation
p218
aVwas demonstrated by studies of interference
p219
aVthat was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain.
p220
aVSo there were benefits in calamities \u2014
p221
aVbenefits to pure science,
p222
aVas well as to applied science
p223
aVand medicine.
p224
aa(lp225
VNow when we come to the period after the Second World War,
p226
aVunintended consequences get even more interesting.
p227
aVAnd my favorite example of that
p228
aVoccurred beginning in 1976,
p229
aVwhen it was discovered
p230
aVthat the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease
p231
aVhad always been present in natural waters,
p232
aVbut it was the precise temperature of the water
p233
aVin heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems
p234
aVthat raised the right temperature
p235
aVfor the maximum reproduction
p236
aVof Legionella bacillus.
p237
aVWell, technology to the rescue.
p238
aVSo chemists got to work,
p239
aVand they developed a bactericide
p240
aVthat became widely used in those systems.
p241
aa(lp242
VBut something else happened in the early 1980s,
p243
aVand that was that there was a mysterious epidemic
p244
aVof failures of tape drives
p245
aVall over the United States.
p246
aVAnd IBM, which made them,
p247
aVjust didn't know what to do.
p248
aVThey commissioned a group of their best scientists
p249
aVto investigate,
p250
aVand what they found was
p251
aVthat all these tape drives
p252
aVwere located near ventilation ducts.
p253
aVWhat happened was the bactericide was formulated
p254
aVwith minute traces of tin.
p255
aVAnd these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads
p256
aVand were crashing the tape heads.
p257
aVSo they reformulated the bactericide.
p258
aVBut what's interesting to me
p259
aVis that this was the first case
p260
aVof a mechanical device
p261
aVsuffering, at least indirectly, from a human disease.
p262
aVSo it shows that we're really all in this together.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VIn fact, it also shows something interesting,
p267
aVthat although our capabilities and technology
p268
aVhave been expanding geometrically,
p269
aVunfortunately, our ability to model their long-term behavior,
p270
aVwhich has also been increasing,
p271
aVhas been increasing only arithmetically.
p272
aVSo one of the characteristic problems of our time
p273
aVis how to close this gap
p274
aVbetween capabilities and foresight.
p275
aVOne other very positive consequence
p276
aVof 20th century technology, though,
p277
aVwas the way in which other kinds of calamities
p278
aVcould lead to positive advances.
p279
aVThere are two historians of business
p280
aVat the University of Maryland,
p281
aVBrent Goldfarb and David Kirsch,
p282
aVwho have done some extremely interesting work,
p283
aVmuch of it still unpublished,
p284
aVon the history of major innovations.
p285
aVThey have combined the list of major innovations,
p286
aVand they've discovered that the greatest number, the greatest decade,
p287
aVfor fundamental innovations,
p288
aVas reflected in all of the lists that others have made \u2014
p289
aVa number of lists that they have merged \u2014
p290
aVwas the Great Depression.
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd nobody knows just why this was so,
p293
aVbut one story can reflect something of it.
p294
aVIt was the origin of the Xerox copier,
p295
aVwhich celebrated its 50th anniversary
p296
aVlast year.
p297
aVAnd Chester Carlson, the inventor,
p298
aVwas a patent attorney.
p299
aVHe really was not intending
p300
aVto work in patent research,
p301
aVbut he couldn't really find an alternative technical job.
p302
aVSo this was the best job he could get.
p303
aVHe was upset by the low quality and high cost
p304
aVof existing patent reproductions,
p305
aVand so he started to develop
p306
aVa system of dry photocopying,
p307
aVwhich he patented in the late 1930s \u2014
p308
aVand which became the first dry photocopier
p309
aVthat was commercially practical
p310
aVin 1960.
p311
aVSo we see that sometimes,
p312
aVas a result of these dislocations,
p313
aVas a result of people
p314
aVleaving their original intended career
p315
aVand going into something else
p316
aVwhere their creativity could make a difference,
p317
aVthat depressions
p318
aVand all kinds of other unfortunate events
p319
aVcan have a paradoxically stimulating effect
p320
aVon creativity.
p321
aa(lp322
VWhat does this mean?
p323
aVIt means, I think,
p324
aVthat we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities.
p325
aVThink of the financial world, for example.
p326
aVThe mentor of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham,
p327
aVdeveloped his system of value investing
p328
aVas a result of his own losses
p329
aVin the 1929 crash.
p330
aVAnd he published that book
p331
aVin the early 1930s,
p332
aVand the book still exists in further editions
p333
aVand is still a fundamental textbook.
p334
aVSo many important creative things can happen
p335
aVwhen people learn from disasters.
p336
aa(lp337
VNow think of the large and small plagues that we have now \u2014
p338
aVbed bugs, killer bees, spam \u2014
p339
aVand it's very possible that the solutions to those
p340
aVwill really extend well beyond the immediate question.
p341
aVIf we think, for example, of Louis Pasteur,
p342
aVwho in the 1860s
p343
aVwas asked to study
p344
aVthe diseases of silk worms for the silk industry,
p345
aVand his discoveries were really the beginning
p346
aVof the germ theory of disease.
p347
aVSo very often, some kind of disaster \u2014
p348
aVsometimes the consequence, for example,
p349
aVof over-cultivation of silk worms,
p350
aVwhich was a problem in Europe at the time \u2014
p351
aVcan be the key to something much bigger.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo this means
p354
aVthat we need to take a different view
p355
aVof unintended consequences.
p356
aVWe need to take a really positive view.
p357
aVWe need to see what they can do for us.
p358
aVWe need to learn
p359
aVfrom those figures that I mentioned.
p360
aVWe need to learn, for example, from Dr. Cushing,
p361
aVwho killed patients
p362
aVin the course of his early operations.
p363
aVHe had to have some errors. He had to have some mistakes.
p364
aVAnd he learned meticulously from his mistakes.
p365
aVAnd as a result,
p366
aVwhen we say, "This isn't brain surgery,"
p367
aVthat pays tribute to how difficult it was
p368
aVfor anyone to learn from their mistakes
p369
aVin a field of medicine
p370
aVthat was considered so discouraging in its prospects.
p371
aVAnd we can also remember
p372
aVhow the pharmaceutical companies
p373
aVwere willing to pool their knowledge,
p374
aVto share their knowledge,
p375
aVin the face of an emergency,
p376
aVwhich they hadn't really been for years and years.
p377
aVThey might have been able to do it earlier.
p378
aa(lp379
VThe message, then, for me,
p380
aVabout unintended consequences
p381
aVis chaos happens;
p382
aVlet's make better use of it.
p383
aa(lp384
VThank you very much.

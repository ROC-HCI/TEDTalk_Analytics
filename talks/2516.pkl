VEric Hirshberg: So I assume that Norman doesn't need much of an introduction,
p5
aVbut TED's audience is global,
p6
aVit's diverse,
p7
aVso I've been tasked with starting with his bio,
p8
aVwhich could easily take up the entire 18 minutes.
p9
aVSo instead we're going to do 93 years in 93 seconds or less.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VYou were born in New Hampshire.
p14
aa(lp15
VNorman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut.
p16
aa(lp17
VEH: New Haven, Connecticut.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VNL: There goes seven more seconds.
p22
aa(lp23
VEH: Nailed it.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VYou were born in New Haven, Connecticut.
p28
aVYour father was a con man \u2014 I got that right.
p29
aVHe was taken away to prison when you were nine years old.
p30
aVYou flew 52 missions as a fighter pilot in World War II.
p31
aVYou came back to \u2014
p32
aa(lp33
VNL: Radio operator.
p34
aa(lp35
VEH: You came to LA to break into Hollywood,
p36
aVfirst in publicity, then in TV.
p37
aVYou had no training as a writer, formally,
p38
aVbut you hustled your way in.
p39
aVYour breakthrough, your debut,
p40
aVwas a little show called "All in the Family."
p41
aVYou followed that up with a string of hits
p42
aVthat to this day is unmatched in Hollywood:
p43
aV"Sanford and Son," "Maude," "Good Times,"
p44
aV"The Jeffersons," "One Day at a Time,"
p45
aV"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,"
p46
aVto name literally a fraction of them.
p47
aVNot only are they all commercially \u2014
p48
aa(lp49
V(Applause)
p50
aa(lp51
VNot only are they all commercially successful,
p52
aVbut many of them push our culture forward
p53
aVby giving the underrepresented members of society
p54
aVtheir first prime-time voice.
p55
aVYou have seven shows in the top 10 at one time.
p56
aVAt one point,
p57
aVyou aggregate an audience of 120 million people per week
p58
aVwatching your content.
p59
aVThat's more than the audience for Super Bowl 50,
p60
aVwhich happens once a year.
p61
aa(lp62
VNL: Holy shit.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
V(Applause)
p67
aa(lp68
VEH: And we're not even to the holy shit part.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VYou land yourself on Richard Nixon's enemies list \u2014
p73
aVhe had one.
p74
aa(lp75
VThat's an applause line, too.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
VYou're inducted into the TV Hall of Fame on the first day that it exists.
p80
aVThen came the movies.
p81
aV"Fried Green Tomatoes,"
p82
aV"The Princess Bride," "Stand By Me,"
p83
aV"This Is Spinal Tap."
p84
aa(lp85
V(Applause)
p86
aa(lp87
VAgain, just to name a fraction.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Applause)
p90
aa(lp91
VThen you wipe the slate clean,
p92
aVstart a third act as a political activist focusing on protecting the First Amendment
p93
aVand the separation of church and state.
p94
aVYou start People For The American Way.
p95
aVYou buy the Declaration of Independence
p96
aVand give it back to the people.
p97
aVYou stay active in both entertainment and politics
p98
aVuntil the ripe old of age of 93,
p99
aVwhen you write a book
p100
aVand make a documentary about your life story.
p101
aVAnd after all that,
p102
aVthey finally think you're ready for a TED Talk.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
V(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VNL: I love being here.
p109
aVAnd I love you for agreeing to do this.
p110
aa(lp111
VEH: Thank you for asking. It's my honor.
p112
aVSo here's my first question.
p113
aVWas your mother proud of you?
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VNL: My mother ...
p118
aVwhat a place to start.
p119
aVLet me put it this way \u2014
p120
aVwhen I came back from the war,
p121
aVshe showed me the letters that I had written her from overseas,
p122
aVand they were absolute love letters.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VThis really sums up my mother.
p127
aVThey were love letters,
p128
aVas if I had written them to \u2014
p129
aVthey were love letters.
p130
aVA year later I asked my mother if I could have them,
p131
aVbecause I'd like to keep them all the years of my life ...
p132
aVShe had thrown them away.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VThat's my mother.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VThe best way I can sum it up in more recent times is \u2014
p141
aVthis is also more recent times \u2014
p142
aVa number of years ago,
p143
aVwhen they started the Hall of Fame to which you referred.
p144
aVIt was a Sunday morning,
p145
aVwhen I got a call from the fellow who ran the TV Academy of Arts & Sciences.
p146
aVHe was calling me to tell me they had met all day yesterday
p147
aVand he was confidentially telling me they were going to start a hall of fame
p148
aVand these were the inductees.
p149
aVI started to say "Richard Nixon,"
p150
aVbecause Richard Nixon \u2014
p151
aa(lp152
VEH: I don't think he was on their list.
p153
aa(lp154
VNL: William Paley, who started CBS,
p155
aVDavid Sarnoff, who started NBC,
p156
aVEdward R. Murrow,
p157
aVthe greatest of the foreign correspondents,
p158
aVPaddy Chayefsky \u2014
p159
aVI think the best writer that ever came out of television \u2014
p160
aVMilton Berle, Lucille Ball
p161
aVand me.
p162
aa(lp163
VEH: Not bad.
p164
aa(lp165
VNL: I call my mother immediately in Hartford, Connecticut.
p166
aV"Mom, this is what's happened,
p167
aVthey're starting a hall of fame."
p168
aa(lp169
VI tell her the list of names and me,
p170
aVand she says,
p171
aV"Listen, if that's what they want to do, who am I to say?"
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
V(Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VThat's my Ma.
p178
aVI think it earns that kind of a laugh
p179
aVbecause everybody has a piece of that mother.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VEH: And the sitcom Jewish mother is born, right there.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo your father also played a large role in your life,
p186
aVmostly by his absence.
p187
aa(lp188
VNL: Yeah.
p189
aa(lp190
VEH: Tell us what happened when you were nine years old.
p191
aa(lp192
VNL: He was flying to Oklahoma
p193
aVwith three guys that my mother said,
p194
aV"I don't want you to have anything to do with them,
p195
aVI don't trust those men."
p196
aVThat's when I heard,
p197
aVmaybe not for the first time,
p198
aV"Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going."
p199
aVAnd he went.
p200
aVIt turns out he was picking up some fake bonds,
p201
aVwhich he was flying across the country to sell.
p202
aVBut the fact that he was going to Oklahoma in a plane,
p203
aVand he was going to bring me back a 10-gallon hat,
p204
aVjust like Ken Maynard, my favorite cowboy wore.
p205
aVYou know, this was a few years after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic.
p206
aVI mean, it was exotic that my father was going there.
p207
aVBut when he came back,
p208
aVthey arrested him as he got off the plane.
p209
aa(lp210
VThat night newspapers were all over the house,
p211
aVmy father was with his hat in front of his face,
p212
aVmanacled to a detective.
p213
aVAnd my mother was selling the furniture, because we were leaving \u2014
p214
aVshe didn't want to stay in that state of shame,
p215
aVin Chelsea, Massachusetts.
p216
aVAnd selling the furniture \u2014
p217
aVthe house was loaded with people.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd in the middle of all of that,
p220
aVsome strange horse's ass put his hand on my shoulder and said,
p221
aV"Well, you're the man of the house now."
p222
aVI'm crying, and this asshole says, "You're the man of the house now."
p223
aVAnd I think that was the moment
p224
aVI began to understand the foolishness of the human condition.
p225
aVSo ...
p226
aVit took a lot of years to look back at it and feel it was a benefit.
p227
aVBut \u2014
p228
aa(lp229
VEH: It's interesting you call it a benefit.
p230
aa(lp231
VNL: Benefit in that it gave me that springboard.
p232
aVI mean that I could think
p233
aVhow foolish it was to say to this crying nine-year-old boy,
p234
aV"You're the man of the house now."
p235
aVAnd then I was crying, and then he said,
p236
aV"And men of the house don't cry."
p237
aVAnd I ...
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VSo ...
p242
aVI look back, and I think
p243
aVthat's when I learned the foolishness of the human condition,
p244
aVand it's been that gift that I've used.
p245
aa(lp246
VEH: So you have a father who's absent,
p247
aVyou have a mother for whom apparently nothing is good enough.
p248
aVDo you think that starting out as a kid who maybe never felt heard
p249
aVstarted you down a journey
p250
aVthat ended with you being an adult
p251
aVwith a weekly audience of 120 million people?
p252
aa(lp253
VNL: I love the way you put that question,
p254
aVbecause I guess I've spent my life wanting \u2014
p255
aVif anything, wanting to be heard.
p256
aVI think \u2014
p257
aVIt's a simple answer, yes,
p258
aVthat was what sparked \u2014
p259
aVwell, there were other things, too.
p260
aVWhen my father was away,
p261
aVI was fooling with a crystal radio set that we had made together,
p262
aVand I caught a signal that turned out to be Father Coughlin.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VYeah, somebody laughed.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VBut not funny,
p271
aVthis was a horse's \u2014
p272
aVanother horse's ass \u2014
p273
aVwho was very vocal about hating the New Deal
p274
aVand Roosevelt and Jews.
p275
aVThe first time I ran into an understanding
p276
aVthat there were people in this world that hated me
p277
aVbecause I was born to Jewish parents.
p278
aVAnd that had an enormous effect on my life.
p279
aa(lp280
VEH: So you had a childhood
p281
aVwith little in the way of strong male role models,
p282
aVexcept for your grandfather.
p283
aVTell us about him.
p284
aa(lp285
VNL: Oh, my grandfather.
p286
aVWell here's the way I always talked about that grandfather.
p287
aVThere were parades,
p288
aVlots of parades when I was a kid.
p289
aVThere were parades on Veteran's Day \u2014
p290
aVthere wasn't a President's Day.
p291
aVThere was Abraham Lincoln's birthday,
p292
aVGeorge Washington's birthday
p293
aVand Flag Day ...
p294
aVAnd lots of little parades.
p295
aVMy grandfather used to take me
p296
aVand we'd stand on the street corner,
p297
aVhe'd hold my hand,
p298
aVand I'd look up and I'd see a tear running down his eye.
p299
aVAnd he meant a great deal to me.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd he used to write presidents of the United States.
p302
aVEvery letter started,
p303
aV"My dearest, darling Mr. President,"
p304
aVand he'd tell him something wonderful about what he did.
p305
aVBut when he disagreed with the President, he also wrote,
p306
aV"My dearest, darling Mr. President,
p307
aVDidn't I tell you last week ...?"
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd I would run down the stairs every now and then
p312
aVand pick up the mail.
p313
aVWe were three flights up,
p314
aV74 York Street, New Haven, Connecticut.
p315
aVAnd I'd pick up a little white envelope reading, "Shya C. called at this address."
p316
aVAnd that's the story I have told about my grandfather \u2014
p317
aa(lp318
VEH: They wrote him back on the envelopes \u2014
p319
aa(lp320
VNL: They wrote back.
p321
aVBut I have shown them myself,
p322
aVgoing way back to Phil Donahue and others before him,
p323
aVliterally dozens of interviews in which I told that story.
p324
aVThis will be the second time I have said the whole story was a lie.
p325
aVThe truth was my grandfather took me to parades,
p326
aVwe had lots of those.
p327
aVThe truth is a tear came down his eye.
p328
aa(lp329
VThe truth is he would write an occasional letter,
p330
aVand I did pick up those little envelopes.
p331
aVBut "My dearest darling Mr. President,"
p332
aVall the rest of it,
p333
aVis a story I borrowed from a good friend
p334
aVwhose grandfather was that grandfather who wrote those letters.
p335
aVAnd, I mean, I stole Arthur Marshall's grandfather
p336
aVand made him my own.
p337
aVAlways.
p338
aa(lp339
VWhen I started to write my memoir \u2014
p340
aV"Even this \u2014"
p341
aVHow about that?
p342
aV"Even This I Get to Experience."
p343
aVWhen I started to write the memoir
p344
aVand I started to think about it,
p345
aVand then I \u2014
p346
aVI \u2014
p347
aVI did a reasonable amount of crying,
p348
aVand I realized how much I needed the father.
p349
aVSo much so that I appropriated Arthur Marshall's grandfather.
p350
aVSo much so, the word "father" \u2014
p351
aVI have six kids by the way.
p352
aVMy favorite role in life.
p353
aVIt and husband to my wife Lyn.
p354
aVBut I stole the man's identity because I needed the father.
p355
aa(lp356
VNow I've gone through a whole lot of shit
p357
aVand come out on the other side,
p358
aVand I forgive my father \u2014
p359
aVthe best thing I \u2014
p360
aVthe worst thing I \u2014
p361
aVThe word I'd like to use about him and think about him is \u2014
p362
aVhe was a rascal.
p363
aVThe fact that he lied and stole and cheated
p364
aVand went to prison ...
p365
aVI submerge that in the word "rascal."
p366
aa(lp367
VEH: Well there's a saying that amateurs borrow and professionals steal.
p368
aa(lp369
VNL: I'm a pro.
p370
aa(lp371
VEH: You're a pro.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VAnd that quote is widely attributed to John Lennon,
p376
aVbut it turns out he stole it from T.S. Eliot.
p377
aVSo you're in good company.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
VEH: I want to talk about your work.
p382
aVObviously the impact of your work has been written about
p383
aVand I'm sure you've heard about it all your life:
p384
aVwhat it meant to people,
p385
aVwhat it meant to our culture,
p386
aVyou heard the applause when I just named the names of the shows,
p387
aVyou raised half the people in the room through your work.
p388
aVBut have there ever been any stories about the impact of your work
p389
aVthat surprised you?
p390
aa(lp391
VNL: Oh, god \u2014
p392
aVsurprised me and delighted me from head to toe.
p393
aVThere was "An Evening with Norman Lear" within the last year
p394
aVthat a group of hip-hop impresarios,
p395
aVperformers and the Academy put together.
p396
aVThe subtext of "An Evening with ..."
p397
aVwas: What do a 92-year-old Jew \u2014
p398
aVthen 92 \u2014
p399
aVand the world of hip-hop have in common?
p400
aVRussell Simmons was among seven on the stage.
p401
aVAnd when he talked about the shows,
p402
aVhe wasn't talking about the Hollywood,
p403
aVGeorge Jefferson in "The Jeffersons,"
p404
aVor the show that was a number five show.
p405
aVHe was talking about a simple thing that made a big \u2014
p406
aa(lp407
VEH: Impact on him?
p408
aa(lp409
VNL: An impact on him \u2014
p410
aVI was hesitating over the word, "change."
p411
aVIt's hard for me to imagine,
p412
aVyou know, changing somebody's life,
p413
aVbut that's the way he put it.
p414
aVHe saw George Jefferson write a check on "The Jeffersons,"
p415
aVand he never knew that a black man could write a check.
p416
aVAnd he says it just impacted his life so \u2014
p417
aVit changed his life.
p418
aa(lp419
VAnd when I hear things like that \u2014
p420
aVlittle things \u2014
p421
aVbecause I know that there isn't anybody in this audience
p422
aVthat wasn't likely responsible today for some little thing they did for somebody,
p423
aVwhether it's as little as a smile or an unexpected "Hello,"
p424
aVthat's how little this thing was.
p425
aVIt could have been the dresser of the set
p426
aVwho put the checkbook on the thing,
p427
aVand George had nothing to do while he was speaking, so he wrote it,
p428
aVI don't know.
p429
aVBut \u2014
p430
aa(lp431
VEH: So in addition to the long list I shared in the beginning,
p432
aVI should have also mentioned that you invented hip-hop.
p433
aa(lp434
V(Laughter)
p435
aa(lp436
VNL: Well ...
p437
aa(lp438
VEH: I want to talk about \u2014
p439
aa(lp440
VNL: Well, then do it.
p441
aa(lp442
V(Laughter)
p443
aa(lp444
VEH: You've lead a life of accomplishment,
p445
aVbut you've also built a life of meaning.
p446
aVAnd all of us strive to do both of those things \u2014
p447
aVnot all of us manage to.
p448
aVBut even those of us who do manage to accomplish both of those,
p449
aVvery rarely do we figure out how to do them together.
p450
aVYou managed to push culture forward through your art
p451
aVwhile also achieving world-beating commercial success.
p452
aVHow did you do both?
p453
aa(lp454
VNL: Here's where my mind goes when I hear that recitation of all I accomplished.
p455
aVThis planet is one of a billion,
p456
aVthey tell us,
p457
aVin a universe of which there are billions \u2014
p458
aVbillions of universes,
p459
aVbillions of planets ...
p460
aVwhich we're trying to save
p461
aVand it requires saving.
p462
aVBut ...
p463
aVanything I may have accomplished is \u2014
p464
aVmy sister once asked me what she does about something
p465
aVthat was going on in Newington, Connecticut.
p466
aVAnd I said, "Write your alderman or your mayor or something."
p467
aVShe said, "Well I'm not Norman Lear, I'm Claire Lear."
p468
aVAnd that was the first time I said what I'm saying,
p469
aVI said, "Claire. With everything you think about what I may have done
p470
aVand everything you've done," \u2014
p471
aVshe never left Newington \u2014
p472
aV"can you get your fingers close enough
p473
aVwhen you consider the size of the planet and so forth,
p474
aVto measure anything I may have done to anything you may have done?"
p475
aa(lp476
VSo ...
p477
aVI am convinced we're all responsible
p478
aVfor doing as much as I may have accomplished.
p479
aVAnd I understand what you're saying \u2014
p480
aa(lp481
VEH: It's an articulate deflection \u2014
p482
aa(lp483
VNL: But you have to really buy into the size and scope
p484
aVof the creator's enterprise, here.
p485
aa(lp486
VEH: But here on this planet you have really mattered.
p487
aa(lp488
VNL: I'm a son of a gun.
p489
aa(lp490
V(Laughter)
p491
aa(lp492
VEH: So I have one more question for you.
p493
aVHow old do you feel?
p494
aa(lp495
VNL: I am the peer of whoever I'm talking to.
p496
aa(lp497
VEH: Well, I feel 93.
p498
aa(lp499
V(Applause)
p500
aa(lp501

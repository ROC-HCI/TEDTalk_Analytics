VIf you look deep into the night sky,
p5
aVyou see stars,
p6
aVand if you look further, you see more stars,
p7
aVand further, galaxies, and  further, more galaxies.
p8
aVBut if you keep looking further and further,
p9
aVeventually you see nothing for a long while,
p10
aVand then finally you see a faint, fading afterglow,
p11
aVand it's the afterglow of the Big Bang.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe
p14
aVwhen everything we see in the night sky
p15
aVwas condensed into an incredibly small,
p16
aVincredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass,
p17
aVand from it sprung everything we see.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, we've mapped that afterglow
p20
aVwith great precision,
p21
aVand when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.
p22
aVWe've mapped the afterglow
p23
aVwith spectacular precision,
p24
aVand one of the shocks about it
p25
aVis that it's almost completely uniform.
p26
aVFourteen billion light years that way
p27
aVand 14 billion light years that way,
p28
aVit's the same temperature.
p29
aVNow it's been 14 billion years
p30
aVsince that Big Bang,
p31
aVand so it's got faint and cold.
p32
aVIt's now 2.7 degrees.
p33
aVBut it's not exactly 2.7 degrees.
p34
aVIt's only 2.7 degrees to about
p35
aV10 parts in a million.
p36
aVOver here, it's a little hotter,
p37
aVand over there, it's a little cooler,
p38
aVand that's incredibly important to everyone in this room,
p39
aVbecause where it was a little hotter,
p40
aVthere was a little more stuff,
p41
aVand where there was a little more stuff,
p42
aVwe have galaxies and clusters of galaxies
p43
aVand superclusters
p44
aVand all the structure you see in the cosmos.
p45
aVAnd those small, little, inhomogeneities,
p46
aV20 parts in a million,
p47
aVthose were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles
p48
aVin that early universe that were stretched
p49
aVacross the size of the entire cosmos.
p50
aa(lp51
VThat is spectacular,
p52
aVand that's not what they found on Monday;
p53
aVwhat they found on Monday is cooler.
p54
aVSo here's what they found on Monday:
p55
aVImagine you take a bell,
p56
aVand you whack the bell with a hammer.
p57
aVWhat happens? It rings.
p58
aVBut if you wait, that ringing fades
p59
aVand fades and fades
p60
aVuntil you don't notice it anymore.
p61
aVNow, that early universe was incredibly dense,
p62
aVlike a metal, way denser,
p63
aVand if you hit it, it would ring,
p64
aVbut the thing ringing would be
p65
aVthe structure of space-time itself,
p66
aVand the hammer would be quantum mechanics.
p67
aVWhat they found on Monday
p68
aVwas evidence of the ringing
p69
aVof the space-time of the early universe,
p70
aVwhat we call gravitational waves
p71
aVfrom the fundamental era,
p72
aVand here's how they found it.
p73
aVThose waves have long since faded.
p74
aVIf you go for a walk,
p75
aVyou don't wiggle.
p76
aVThose gravitational waves in the structure of space
p77
aVare totally invisible for all practical purposes.
p78
aVBut early on, when the universe was making
p79
aVthat last afterglow,
p80
aVthe gravitational waves
p81
aVput little twists in the structure
p82
aVof the light that we see.
p83
aVSo by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper \u2014
p84
aVin fact, these guys spent three years on the South Pole
p85
aVlooking straight up through the coldest, clearest,
p86
aVcleanest air they possibly could find
p87
aVlooking deep into the night sky and studying
p88
aVthat glow and looking for the faint twists
p89
aVwhich are the symbol, the signal,
p90
aVof gravitational waves,
p91
aVthe ringing of the early universe.
p92
aVAnd on Monday, they announced
p93
aVthat they had found it.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd the thing that's so spectacular about that to me
p96
aVis not just the ringing, though that is awesome.
p97
aVThe thing that's totally amazing,
p98
aVthe reason I'm on this stage, is because
p99
aVwhat that tells us is something deep about the early universe.
p100
aVIt tells us that we
p101
aVand everything we see around us
p102
aVare basically one large bubble \u2014
p103
aVand this is the idea of inflation\u2014
p104
aVone large bubble surrounded by something else.
p105
aVThis isn't conclusive evidence for inflation,
p106
aVbut anything that isn't inflation that explains this
p107
aVwill look the same.
p108
aVThis is a theory, an idea,
p109
aVthat has been around for a while,
p110
aVand we never thought we we'd really see it.
p111
aVFor good reasons, we thought we'd never see
p112
aVkiller evidence, and this is killer evidence.
p113
aa(lp114
VBut the really crazy idea
p115
aVis that our bubble is just one bubble
p116
aVin a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff.
p117
aVWe're never going to see the stuff outside,
p118
aVbut by going to the South Pole and spending three years
p119
aVlooking at the detailed structure of the night sky,
p120
aVwe can figure out
p121
aVthat we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that.
p122
aVAnd that amazes me.
p123
aa(lp124
VThanks a lot.

His research in theoretical physics focuses on string  theory both as a model of quantum gravity and as a strong-coupling  description of non-gravitational systems. </p><p>Like water, string theory enjoys many distinct phases in which the  low-energy phenomena take qualitatively different forms. In its most  familiar phases, string theory reduces to a perturbative theory of  quantum gravity. These phases are useful for studying, for example, the  resolution of singularities in classical gravity, or the set of  possibilities for the geometry and fields of spacetime. Along these  lines, Adams is particularly interested in microscopic quantization of  flux vacua, and in the search for constraints on low-energy physics  derived from consistency of the stringy UV completion.</p>In other phases, when the gravitational interactions become strong  and a smooth spacetime geometry ceases to be a good approximation, a  more convenient description of string theory may be given in terms of a  weakly-coupled non-gravitational quantum field theory. Remarkably, these  two descriptions&mdash;with and without gravity&mdash;appear to be completely  equivalent, with one remaining weakly-coupled when its dual is strongly  interacting. This equivalence, known as gauge-gravity duality, allows us  to study strongly-coupled string and quantum field theories by studying  perturbative features of their weakly-coupled duals. Gauge-gravity  duals have already led to interesting predictions for the quark-gluon  plasma studied at RHIC. A major focus of Adams&#39;s present research is to  use such dualities to find weakly-coupled descriptions of  strongly-interacting condensed matter systems which can be realized in  the lab.", "slug": "allan_adams", "whotheyare": "Allan Adams is a theoretical physicist working at the intersection of fluid dynamics, quantum field theory and string theory.

His research in theoretical physics focuses on string  theory both as a model of quantum gravity and as a strong-coupling  description of non-gravitational systems. </p><p>Like water, string theory enjoys many distinct phases in which the  low-energy phenomena take qualitatively different forms. In its most  familiar phases, string theory reduces to a perturbative theory of  quantum gravity. These phases are useful for studying, for example, the  resolution of singularities in classical gravity, or the set of  possibilities for the geometry and fields of spacetime. Along these  lines, Adams is particularly interested in microscopic quantization of  flux vacua, and in the search for constraints on low-energy physics  derived from consistency of the stringy UV completion.</p>In other phases, when the gravitational interactions become strong  and a smooth spacetime geometry ceases to be a good approximation, a  more convenient description of string theory may be given in terms of a  weakly-coupled non-gravitational quantum field theory. Remarkably, these  two descriptions&mdash;with and without gravity&mdash;appear to be completely  equivalent, with one remaining weakly-coupled when its dual is strongly  interacting. This equivalence, known as gauge-gravity duality, allows us  to study strongly-coupled string and quantum field theories by studying  perturbative features of their weakly-coupled duals. Gauge-gravity  duals have already led to interesting predictions for the quark-gluon  plasma studied at RHIC. A major focus of Adams&#39;s present research is to  use such dualities to find weakly-coupled descriptions of  strongly-interacting condensed matter systems which can be realized in  the lab.", "slug": "allan_adams", "whotheyare": "Allan Adams is a theoretical physicist working at the intersection of fluid dynamics, quantum field theory and string theory.

VMy journey to coming here today
p5
aVstarted in 1974.
p6
aVThat's me with the funny gloves.
p7
aVI was 17 and going on a peace walk.
p8
aVWhat I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there
p9
aVwith me, were Moonies.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVAnd within a week
p12
aVI had come to believe
p13
aVthat the second coming of Christ had occurred,
p14
aVthat it was Sun Myung Moon,
p15
aVand that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God
p16
aVto be his disciple.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow as cool as that sounds,
p19
aVmy family was not that thrilled with this.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVAnd they tried everything they could to get me out of there.
p22
aVThere was an underground railroad of sorts
p23
aVthat was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it.
p24
aVThey were called deprogrammers.
p25
aVAnd after about five long years
p26
aVmy family had me deprogrammed.
p27
aVAnd I then became a deprogrammer.
p28
aVI started going out on cases.
p29
aVAnd after about five years of doing this,
p30
aVI was arrested for kidnapping.
p31
aVMost of the cases I went out on
p32
aVwere called involuntary.
p33
aVWhat happened was that the family
p34
aVhad to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.
p35
aVAnd so they took them to some safe place.
p36
aVAnd we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.
p37
aVAnd so after this happened,
p38
aVI decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd about 20 years went by.
p41
aVThere was a burning question though that would not leave me.
p42
aVAnd that was, "How did this happen to me?"
p43
aVAnd in fact, what did happen to my brain?
p44
aVBecause something did.
p45
aVAnd so I decided to write a book, a memoir,
p46
aVabout this decade of my life.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd toward the end of writing that book
p49
aVthere was a documentary that came out.
p50
aVIt was on Jonestown.
p51
aVAnd it had a chilling effect on me.
p52
aVThese are the dead in Jonestown.
p53
aVAbout 900 people died that day,
p54
aVmost of them taking their own lives.
p55
aVWomen gave poison to their babies,
p56
aVand watched foam come from their mouths as they died.
p57
aa(lp58
VThe top picture is a group of Moonies
p59
aVthat have been blessed by their messiah.
p60
aVTheir mates were chosen for them.
p61
aVThe bottom picture is Hitler youth.
p62
aVThis is the leg of a suicide bomber.
p63
aVThe thing I had to admit to myself,
p64
aVwith great repulsion,
p65
aVwas that I get it.
p66
aVI understand how this could happen.
p67
aVI understand how someone's brain,
p68
aVhow someone's mind can come to the place
p69
aVwhere it makes sense \u2014
p70
aVin fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that \u2014
p71
aVnot to try to save the world through genocide.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd so what is this? How does this work?
p74
aVAnd how I've come to view what happened to me
p75
aVis a viral, memetic infection.
p76
aVFor those of you who aren't familiar with memetics,
p77
aVa meme has been defined as
p78
aVan idea that replicates in the human brain
p79
aVand moves from brain to brain like a virus,
p80
aVmuch like a virus. The way a virus works is \u2014
p81
aVit can infect and do the most damage to someone
p82
aVwho has a compromised immune system.
p83
aa(lp84
VIn 1974, I was young, I was naive,
p85
aVand I was pretty lost in my world.
p86
aVI was really idealistic.
p87
aVThese easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing
p88
aVwhen you are emotionally vulnerable.
p89
aVWhat happens is that
p90
aVcircular logic takes over.
p91
aV"Moon is one with God.
p92
aVGod is going to fix all the problems in the world.
p93
aVAll I have to do is humbly follow.
p94
aVBecause God is going to stop war and hunger \u2014
p95
aVall these things I wanted to do \u2014
p96
aVall I have to do is humbly follow.
p97
aVBecause after all, God is [working through] the messiah. He's going to fix all this."
p98
aVIt becomes impenetrable.
p99
aVAnd the most dangerous part of this
p100
aVis that is creates "us" and "them,"
p101
aV"right" and "wrong,"
p102
aV"good" and "evil."
p103
aVAnd it makes anything possible,
p104
aVmakes anything rationalizable.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd the thing is, though,
p107
aVif you looked at my brain
p108
aVduring those years in the Moonies \u2014
p109
aVneuroscience is expanding exponentially,
p110
aVas Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.
p111
aVWe're beginning to look inside the brain.
p112
aVAnd so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with
p113
aVa viral memetic infection like this,
p114
aVand compared it to anyone in this room,
p115
aVor anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis,
p116
aVI am convinced it would look very, very different.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd that, strange as it may sound,
p119
aVgives me hope.
p120
aVAnd the reason that gives me hope
p121
aVis that the first thing is to admit
p122
aVthat we have a problem.
p123
aVBut it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.
p124
aVIt happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.
p125
aVAnd so this is something that, through research and education,
p126
aVI believe that we can solve.
p127
aVAnd so the first step is to realize
p128
aVthat we can do this together,
p129
aVand that there is no "us" and "them."
p130
aVThank you very much. (Applause)

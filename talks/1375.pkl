VPeter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips
p17
aVI collected over the last six months \u2014
p18
aVcould have easily been the last six days
p19
aVor the last six years.
p20
aVThe point is that the news media
p21
aVpreferentially feeds us negative stories
p22
aVbecause that's what our minds pay attention to.
p23
aVAnd there's a very good reason for that.
p24
aVEvery second of every day,
p25
aVour senses bring in way too much data
p26
aVthan we can possibly process in our brains.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd because nothing is more important to us
p29
aVthan survival,
p30
aVthe first stop of all of that data
p31
aVis an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe
p32
aVcalled the amygdala.
p33
aVNow the amygdala is our early warning detector,
p34
aVour danger detector.
p35
aVIt sorts and scours through all of the information
p36
aVlooking for anything in the environment that might harm us.
p37
aVSo given a dozen news stories,
p38
aVwe will preferentially look
p39
aVat the negative news.
p40
aVAnd that old newspaper saying,
p41
aV"If it bleeds it leads,"
p42
aVis very true.
p43
aVSo given all of our digital devices
p44
aVthat are bringing all the negative news to us
p45
aVseven days a week, 24 hours a day,
p46
aVit's no wonder that we're pessimistic.
p47
aVIt's no wonder that people think
p48
aVthat the world is getting worse.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut perhaps that's not the case.
p51
aVPerhaps instead,
p52
aVit's the distortions brought to us
p53
aVof what's really going on.
p54
aVPerhaps the tremendous progress we've made
p55
aVover the last century
p56
aVby a series of forces
p57
aVare, in fact, accelerating to a point
p58
aVthat we have the potential in the next three decades
p59
aVto create a world of abundance.
p60
aVNow I'm not saying
p61
aVwe don't have our set of problems \u2014
p62
aVclimate crisis, species extinction,
p63
aVwater and energy shortage \u2014 we surely do.
p64
aVAnd as humans, we are far better
p65
aVat seeing the problems way in advance,
p66
aVbut ultimately we knock them down.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo let's look
p69
aVat what this last century has been
p70
aVto see where we're going.
p71
aVOver the last hundred years,
p72
aVthe average human lifespan has more than doubled,
p73
aVaverage per capita income adjusted for inflation
p74
aVaround the world has tripled.
p75
aVChildhood mortality
p76
aVhas come down a factor of 10.
p77
aVAdd to that the cost of food, electricity,
p78
aVtransportation, communication
p79
aVhave dropped 10 to 1,000-fold.
p80
aVSteve Pinker has showed us
p81
aVthat, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever
p82
aVin human history.
p83
aVAnd Charles Kenny
p84
aVthat global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent
p85
aVin the last 130 years.
p86
aVWe truly are living in an extraordinary time.
p87
aVAnd many people forget this.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd we keep setting our expectations higher and higher.
p90
aVIn fact, we redefine what poverty means.
p91
aVThink of this, in America today,
p92
aVthe majority of people under the poverty line
p93
aVstill have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators,
p94
aVtelevision, mobile phones,
p95
aVair conditioning and cars.
p96
aVThe wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet,
p97
aVcould have never dreamed of such luxuries.
p98
aa(lp99
VUnderpinning much of this
p100
aVis technology,
p101
aVand of late,
p102
aVexponentially growing technologies.
p103
aVMy good friend Ray Kurzweil
p104
aVshowed that any tool that becomes an information technology
p105
aVjumps on this curve, on Moore's Law,
p106
aVand experiences price performance doubling
p107
aVevery 12 to 24 months.
p108
aVThat's why the cellphone in your pocket
p109
aVis literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster
p110
aVthan a supercomputer of the '70s.
p111
aVNow look at this curve.
p112
aVThis is Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
p113
aVI want you to notice two things from this curve.
p114
aVNumber one, how smooth it is \u2014
p115
aVthrough good time and bad time, war time and peace time,
p116
aVrecession, depression and boom time.
p117
aVThis is the result of faster computers
p118
aVbeing used to build faster computers.
p119
aVIt doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.
p120
aVAnd also, even though it's plotted
p121
aVon a log curve on the left,
p122
aVit's curving upwards.
p123
aVThe rate at which the technology is getting faster
p124
aVis itself getting faster.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd on this curve, riding on Moore's Law,
p127
aVare a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies
p128
aVavailable to all of us.
p129
aVCloud computing,
p130
aVwhat my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing;
p131
aVsensors and networks; robotics;
p132
aV3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute
p133
aVpersonalized production around the planet;
p134
aVsynthetic biology;
p135
aVfuels, vaccines and foods;
p136
aVdigital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I.
p137
aVI mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy
p138
aVby IBM's Watson?
p139
aVI mean, that was epic.
p140
aVIn fact, I scoured the headlines
p141
aVlooking for the best headline in a newspaper I could.
p142
aVAnd I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents."
p143
aVJeopardy's not an easy game.
p144
aVIt's about the nuance of human language.
p145
aVAnd imagine if you would
p146
aVA.I.'s like this on the cloud
p147
aVavailable to every person with a cellphone.
p148
aa(lp149
VFour years ago here at TED,
p150
aVRay Kurzweil and I started a new university
p151
aVcalled Singularity University.
p152
aVAnd we teach our students all of these technologies,
p153
aVand particularly how they can be used
p154
aVto solve humanity's grand challenges.
p155
aVAnd every year we ask them
p156
aVto start a company or a product or a service
p157
aVthat can affect positively the lives of a billion people
p158
aVwithin a decade.
p159
aVThink about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students
p160
aVcan touch the lives of a billion people today.
p161
aV30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous.
p162
aVToday we can point at dozens of companies
p163
aVthat have done just that.
p164
aa(lp165
VWhen I think about creating abundance,
p166
aVit's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet;
p167
aVit's about creating a life of possibility.
p168
aVIt is about taking that which was scarce
p169
aVand making it abundant.
p170
aVYou see, scarcity is contextual,
p171
aVand technology is a resource-liberating force.
p172
aVLet me give you an example.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo this is a story of Napoleon III
p175
aVin the mid-1800s.
p176
aVHe's the dude on the left.
p177
aVHe invited over to dinner
p178
aVthe king of Siam.
p179
aVAll of Napoleon's troops
p180
aVwere fed with silver utensils,
p181
aVNapoleon himself with gold utensils.
p182
aVBut the King of Siam,
p183
aVhe was fed with aluminum utensils.
p184
aVYou see, aluminum
p185
aVwas the most valuable metal on the planet,
p186
aVworth more than gold and platinum.
p187
aVIt's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument
p188
aVis made of aluminum.
p189
aVYou see, even though aluminum
p190
aVis 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass,
p191
aVit doesn't come as a pure metal.
p192
aVIt's all bound by oxygen and silicates.
p193
aVBut then the technology of electrolysis came along
p194
aVand literally made aluminum so cheap
p195
aVthat we use it with throw-away mentality.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo let's project this analogy going forward.
p198
aVWe think about energy scarcity.
p199
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p200
aVwe are on a planet
p201
aVthat is bathed with 5,000 times more energy
p202
aVthan we use in a year.
p203
aV16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface
p204
aVevery 88 minutes.
p205
aVIt's not about being scarce,
p206
aVit's about accessibility.
p207
aVAnd there's good news here.
p208
aVFor the first time, this year
p209
aVthe cost of solar-generated electricity
p210
aVis 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India \u2014
p211
aV8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees.
p212
aVThe cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year.
p213
aVLast month, MIT put out a study
p214
aVshowing that by the end of this decade,
p215
aVin the sunny parts of the United States,
p216
aVsolar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour
p217
aVcompared to 15 cents
p218
aVas a national average.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd if we have abundant energy,
p221
aVwe also have abundant water.
p222
aVNow we talk about water wars.
p223
aVDo you remember
p224
aVwhen Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft
p225
aVback towards the Earth,
p226
aVin 1990 after it just passed Saturn?
p227
aVHe took a famous photo. What was it called?
p228
aV"A Pale Blue Dot."
p229
aVBecause we live on a water planet.
p230
aVWe live on a planet 70 percent covered by water.
p231
aVYes, 97.5 percent is saltwater,
p232
aVtwo percent is ice,
p233
aVand we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet,
p234
aVbut here too there is hope.
p235
aVAnd there is technology coming online,
p236
aVnot 10, 20 years from now,
p237
aVright now.
p238
aVThere's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning,
p241
aVone of the great DIY innovators,
p242
aVI'd like to share with you \u2014 he gave me permission to do so \u2014
p243
aVhis technology called Slingshot
p244
aVthat many of you may have heard of,
p245
aVit is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.
p246
aVIt's able to generate
p247
aVa thousand liters of clean drinking water a day
p248
aVout of any source \u2014 saltwater, polluted water, latrine \u2014
p249
aVat less than two cents a liter.
p250
aVThe chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed
p251
aVto do a major test
p252
aVof hundreds of units of this in the developing world.
p253
aVAnd if that pans out,
p254
aVwhich I have every confidence it will,
p255
aVCoca-Cola will deploy this globally
p256
aVto 206 countries
p257
aVaround the planet.
p258
aVThis is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology,
p259
aVthat exists today.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd we've seen this in cellphones.
p262
aVMy goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration
p263
aVof cellphones in the developing world
p264
aVby the end of 2013.
p265
aVThink about it,
p266
aVthat a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya
p267
aVhas better mobile comm
p268
aVthan President Reagan did 25 years ago.
p269
aVAnd if they're on a smartphone on Google,
p270
aVthey've got access to more knowledge and information
p271
aVthan President Clinton did 15 years ago.
p272
aVThey're living in a world of information and communication abundance
p273
aVthat no one could have ever predicted.
p274
aVBetter than that,
p275
aVthe things that you and I
p276
aVspent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for \u2014
p277
aVGPS, HD video and still images,
p278
aVlibraries of books and music,
p279
aVmedical diagnostic technology \u2014
p280
aVare now literally dematerializing and demonetizing
p281
aVinto your cellphone.
p282
aa(lp283
VProbably the best part of it
p284
aVis what's coming down the pike in health.
p285
aVLast month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation
p286
aVsomething called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.
p287
aVWe're challenging teams around the world
p288
aVto basically combine these technologies
p289
aVinto a mobile device
p290
aVthat you can speak to, because it's got A.I.,
p291
aVyou can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick.
p292
aVAnd to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better
p293
aVthan a team of board-certified doctors.
p294
aVSo literally, imagine this device
p295
aVin the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors,
p296
aV25 percent of the disease burden
p297
aVand 1.3 percent of the health care workers.
p298
aVWhen this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus
p299
aVthat it doesn't recognize,
p300
aVit calls the CDC
p301
aVand prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place.
p302
aa(lp303
VBut here, here is the biggest force
p304
aVfor bringing about a world of abundance.
p305
aVI call it the rising billion.
p306
aVSo the white lines here are population.
p307
aVWe just passed the seven billion mark on Earth.
p308
aVAnd by the way,
p309
aVthe biggest protection against a population explosion
p310
aVis making the world educated
p311
aVand healthy.
p312
aVIn 2010,
p313
aVwe had just short of two billion people
p314
aVonline, connected.
p315
aVBy 2020,
p316
aVthat's going from two billion to five billion
p317
aVInternet users.
p318
aVThree billion new minds
p319
aVwho have never been heard from before
p320
aVare connecting to the global conversation.
p321
aVWhat will these people want?
p322
aVWhat will they consume? What will they desire?
p323
aVAnd rather than having economic shutdown,
p324
aVwe're about to have the biggest economic injection ever.
p325
aVThese people represent
p326
aVtens of trillions of dollars
p327
aVinjected into the global economy.
p328
aVAnd they will get healthier
p329
aVby using the Tricorder,
p330
aVand they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy,
p331
aVand by literally being able to use
p332
aV3D printing and infinite computing
p333
aV[become] more productive than ever before.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo what could three billion rising,
p336
aVhealthy, educated, productive members of humanity
p337
aVbring to us?
p338
aVHow about a set of voices that have never been heard from before.
p339
aVWhat about giving the oppressed,
p340
aVwherever they might be,
p341
aVthe voice to be heard and the voice to act
p342
aVfor the first time ever?
p343
aVWhat will these three billion people bring?
p344
aVWhat about contributions we can't even predict?
p345
aVThe one thing I've learned at the X Prize
p346
aVis that small teams
p347
aVdriven by their passion with a clear focus
p348
aVcan do extraordinary things,
p349
aVthings that large corporations and governments
p350
aVcould only do in the past.
p351
aa(lp352
VLet me share and close with a story
p353
aVthat really got me excited.
p354
aVThere is a program that some of you might have heard of.
p355
aVIt's a game called Foldit.
p356
aVIt came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.
p357
aVAnd this is a game
p358
aVwhere individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids
p359
aVand figure out how the protein is going to fold.
p360
aVAnd how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality.
p361
aVAnd it's very important for research in medicine.
p362
aVAnd up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem.
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd this game has been played
p365
aVby university professors and so forth.
p366
aVAnd it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people
p367
aVcame online and started playing it.
p368
aVAnd it showed that, in fact, today,
p369
aVthe human pattern recognition machinery
p370
aVis better at folding proteins than the best computers.
p371
aVAnd when these individuals went and looked
p372
aVat who was the best protein folder in the world,
p373
aVit wasn't an MIT professor,
p374
aVit wasn't a CalTech student,
p375
aVit was a person from England, from Manchester,
p376
aVa woman who, during the day,
p377
aVwas an executive assistant at a rehab clinic
p378
aVand, at night, was the world's best protein folder.
p379
aa(lp380
VLadies and gentlemen,
p381
aVwhat gives me tremendous confidence
p382
aVin the future
p383
aVis the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals
p384
aVto take on the grand challenges of this planet.
p385
aVWe have the tools with this exponential technology.
p386
aVWe have the passion of the DIY innovator.
p387
aVWe have the capital of the techno-philanthropist.
p388
aVAnd we have three billion new minds
p389
aVcoming online to work with us
p390
aVto solve the grand challenges,
p391
aVto do that which we must do.
p392
aVWe are living into extraordinary decades ahead.
p393
aa(lp394
VThank you.

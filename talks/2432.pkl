VFood crisis.
p5
aVIt's in the news every day.
p6
aVBut what is it?
p7
aa(lp8
VSome places in the world it's too little food,
p9
aVmaybe too much.
p10
aVOther places, GMO is saving the world.
p11
aVMaybe GMO is the problem?
p12
aVToo much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans, toxic oceans,
p13
aVattenuation of nutrition.
p14
aVThey go on and on.
p15
aVAnd I find the current climate of this discussion
p16
aVincredibly disempowering.
p17
aVSo how do we bring that to something that we understand?
p18
aa(lp19
VHow is this apple food crisis?
p20
aVYou've all eaten an apple in the last week, I'm sure.
p21
aVHow old do you think it was from when it was picked?
p22
aVTwo weeks?
p23
aVTwo months?
p24
aVEleven months \u2014
p25
aVthe average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
p26
aVAnd I don't expect it to be much different in Europe
p27
aVor anywhere else in the world.
p28
aVWe pick them,
p29
aVwe put them in cold storage,
p30
aVwe gas the cold storage \u2014
p31
aVthere's actually documented proof
p32
aVof workers trying to go into these environments
p33
aVto retrieve an apple,
p34
aVand dying,
p35
aVbecause the atmosphere
p36
aVthat they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans.
p37
aa(lp38
VHow is it that none of you knew this?
p39
aVWhy didn't I know this?
p40
aVNinety percent of the quality of that apple \u2014
p41
aVall of the antioxidants \u2014 are gone by the time we get it.
p42
aVIt's basically a little ball of sugar.
p43
aVHow did we get so information poor
p44
aVand how can we do better?
p45
aa(lp46
VI think what's missing is a platform.
p47
aVI know platforms \u2014 I know computers,
p48
aVthey put me on the Internet when I was young.
p49
aVI did very weird things \u2014
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
Von this platform.
p54
aVBut I met people, and I could express myself.
p55
aa(lp56
VHow do you express yourself in food?
p57
aVIf we had a platform,
p58
aVwe might feel empowered to question: What if?
p59
aVFor me, I questioned:
p60
aVWhat if climate was democratic?
p61
aVSo, this is a map of climate in the world.
p62
aVThe most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
p63
aVThey shift and they change,
p64
aVand Californian farmers now become Mexican farmers.
p65
aVChina picks up land in Brazil to grow better food,
p66
aVand we're a slave to climate.
p67
aVWhat if each country had its own productive climate?
p68
aVWhat would that change about how we live?
p69
aVWhat would that change about quality of life and nutrition?
p70
aa(lp71
VThe last generation's problem was, we need more food
p72
aVand we need it cheap.
p73
aVWelcome to your global farm.
p74
aVWe built a huge analog farm.
p75
aVAll these traces \u2014
p76
aVthese are cars, planes, trains and automobiles.
p77
aVIt's a miracle that we feed seven billion people
p78
aVwith just a few of us involved in the production of food.
p79
aa(lp80
VWhat if ...
p81
aVwe built a digital farm?
p82
aVA digital world farm.
p83
aVWhat if you could take this apple,
p84
aVdigitize it somehow,
p85
aVsend it through particles in the air
p86
aVand reconstitute it on the other side?
p87
aVWhat if?
p88
aa(lp89
VGoing through some of these quotes,
p90
aVyou know, they inspire me to do what I do.
p91
aa(lp92
VFirst one:
p93
aa(lp94
V["Japanese farming has no youth, no water, no land and no future."]
p95
aa(lp96
VThat's what I landed to the day that I went to Minamisanriku,
p97
aVone stop south of Fukushima,
p98
aVafter the disaster.
p99
aVThe kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo,
p100
aVthe land is contaminated,
p101
aVthey already import 70 percent of their own food.
p102
aVBut it's not unique to Japan.
p103
aVTwo percent of the American population is involved in farming.
p104
aVWhat good answer comes from two percent of any population?
p105
aVAs we go around the world,
p106
aV50 percent of the African population is under 18.
p107
aVEighty percent don't want to be farmers.
p108
aVFarming is hard.
p109
aVThe life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable.
p110
aVThey go into the city.
p111
aVIn India:
p112
aVfarmers' families not being able to have basic access to utilities,
p113
aVmore farmer suicides this year and the previous 10 before that.
p114
aVIt's uncomfortable to talk about.
p115
aVWhere are they going?
p116
aVInto the city.
p117
aVNo young people, and everyone's headed in.
p118
aVSo how do we build this platform that inspires the youth?
p119
aa(lp120
VWelcome to the new tractor.
p121
aVThis is my combine.
p122
aVA number of years ago now,
p123
aVI went to Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot
p124
aVand I started hacking.
p125
aVAnd I built silly things
p126
aVand I made plants dance
p127
aVand I attached them to my computer
p128
aVand I killed them all \u2014
p129
aVa lot.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VI eventually got them to survive.
p134
aVAnd I created one of the most intimate relationships
p135
aVI've ever had in my life,
p136
aVbecause I was learning the language of plants.
p137
aVI wanted to make it bigger.
p138
aVThey said, "Knock yourself out, kid!
p139
aVHere's an old electronics room that nobody wants.
p140
aVWhat can you do?"
p141
aa(lp142
VWith my team, we built a farm inside of the media lab,
p143
aVa place historically known not for anything about biology
p144
aVbut everything about digital life.
p145
aVInside of these 60 square feet,
p146
aVwe produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month \u2014
p147
aVnot a lot of food.
p148
aVAnd there's a lot of interesting technology in there.
p149
aVBut the most interesting thing?
p150
aVBeautiful, white roots,
p151
aVdeep, green colors
p152
aVand a monthly harvest.
p153
aVIs this a new cafeteria?
p154
aVIs this a new retail experience?
p155
aVIs this a new grocery store?
p156
aVI can tell you one thing for sure:
p157
aVthis is the first time
p158
aVanybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VWe get our salad in bags;
p163
aVthere's nothing wrong with that.
p164
aVBut what happens
p165
aVwhen you have an image-based processing expert,
p166
aVa data scientist,
p167
aVa roboticist,
p168
aVripping roots off and thinking,
p169
aV"Huh. I know something about \u2014
p170
aVI could make this happen, I want to try."
p171
aa(lp172
VIn that process we would bring the plants out
p173
aVand we would take some back to the lab,
p174
aVbecause if you grew it, you don't throw it away;
p175
aVit's kind of precious to you.
p176
aVI have this weird tongue now,
p177
aVbecause I'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until I've eaten it first,
p178
aVbecause I want it to be good.
p179
aVSo I eat lettuce every day
p180
aVand I can tell the pH of a lettuce within .1.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VI'm like, "No, that's 6.1 \u2014 no, no, you can't eat it today."
p185
aa(lp186
V(Applause)
p187
aa(lp188
VThis lettuce that day was hyper sweet.
p189
aVIt was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed
p190
aVand it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself:
p191
aV"I'm not going to die!"
p192
aVAnd the plants not-going-to-die, taste sweet to me.
p193
aVTechnologists falling backwards into plant physiology.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo we thought other people needed to be able to try this.
p196
aVWe want to see what people can create,
p197
aVso we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere.
p198
aVAnd then we built it.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo on the facade of the media lab is my lab,
p201
aVthat has about 30 points of sensing per plant.
p202
aVIf you know about the genome or genetics,
p203
aVthis is the phenome, right?
p204
aVThe phenomena.
p205
aVWhen you say, "I like the strawberries from Mexico,"
p206
aVyou really like the strawberries from the climate
p207
aVthat produced the expression that you like.
p208
aVSo if you're coding climate \u2014
p209
aVthis much CO2, this much O2 creates a recipe \u2014 you're coding
p210
aVthe expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant,
p211
aVthe size of that plant, the shape, the color, the texture.
p212
aVWe need data,
p213
aVso we put a bunch of sensors in there
p214
aVto tell us what's going on.
p215
aa(lp216
VIf you think of your houseplants,
p217
aVand you look at your houseplant
p218
aVand you're super sad, because you're like,
p219
aV"Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?"
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VFarmers develop the most beautiful fortune-telling eyes
p224
aVby the time they're in their late 60s and 70s.
p225
aVThey can tell you when you see that plant dying
p226
aVthat it's a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency
p227
aVor it needs more humidity.
p228
aVThose beautiful eyes are not being passed down.
p229
aa(lp230
VThese are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.
p231
aVWe trend those data points over time.
p232
aVWe correlate those data points to individual plants.
p233
aVThese are all the broccoli in my lab that day, by IP address.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VWe have IP-addressable broccoli.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VSo if that's not weird enough,
p242
aVyou can click one and you get a plant profile.
p243
aVAnd what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant,
p244
aVbut not like you'd think,
p245
aVit's not just when it's ready.
p246
aVWhen does it achieve the nutrition that I need?
p247
aVWhen does it achieve the taste that I desire?
p248
aVIs it getting too much water?
p249
aVIs it getting too much sun?
p250
aVAlerts.
p251
aVIt can talk to me, it's conversant,
p252
aVwe have a language.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
V(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VI think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook, right?
p259
aVThat's a plant profile
p260
aVand that plant will start making friends.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd I mean it \u2014 it will make friends with other plants
p265
aVthat use less nitrogen, more phosphorus,
p266
aVless potassium.
p267
aVWe're going to learn about a complexity
p268
aVthat we can only guess at now.
p269
aVAnd they may not friend us back \u2014 I don't know, they might friend us back,
p270
aVit depends on how we act.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo this is my lab now.
p273
aVIt's a little bit more systematized,
p274
aVmy background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things,
p275
aVso I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd so \u2014
p278
aVinside of this environment,
p279
aVwe're experimenting with all kinds of things.
p280
aVThis process, aeroponics, was developed by NASA for Mir Space Station
p281
aVfor reducing the amount of water they send into space.
p282
aVWhat it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants:
p283
aVwater, minerals and oxygen.
p284
aVRoots are not that complicated,
p285
aVso when you give them that, you get this amazing expression.
p286
aVIt's like the plant has two hearts.
p287
aVAnd because it has two hearts,
p288
aVit grows four or five times faster.
p289
aVIt's a perfect world.
p290
aVWe've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world
p291
aVand we're going to continue to do that,
p292
aVbut we're going to have a new tool, too,
p293
aVwhich is perfect world.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo we've grown all kinds of things.
p296
aVThese tomatoes hadn't been in commercial production for 150 years.
p297
aVDo you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks?
p298
aVBanks of seed.
p299
aVIt's amazing.
p300
aVThey have germplasm alive and things that you've never eaten.
p301
aVI am the only person in this room that's eaten that kind of tomato.
p302
aVProblem is it was a sauce tomato and we don't know how to cook,
p303
aVso we ate a sauce tomato, which is not that great.
p304
aVBut we've done things with protein \u2014 we've grown all kinds of things.
p305
aVWe've grown humans \u2014
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VWell maybe you could, but we didn't.
p310
aa(lp311
VBut what we realized is,
p312
aVthe tool was too big, it was too expensive.
p313
aVI was starting to put them around the world
p314
aVand they were about 100,000 dollars.
p315
aVFinding somebody with 100 grand in their back pocket isn't easy,
p316
aVso we wanted to make a small one.
p317
aa(lp318
VThis project was actually one of my student's \u2014
p319
aVmechanical engineering undergraduate, Camille.
p320
aVSo Camille and I and my team,
p321
aVwe iterated all summer,
p322
aVhow to make it cheaper, how to make it work better,
p323
aVhow to make it so other people can make it.
p324
aVThen we dropped them off in schools, seventh through eleventh grade.
p325
aVAnd if you want to be humbled, try to teach a kid something.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo I went into this school and I said,
p328
aV"Set it to 65 percent humidity."
p329
aa(lp330
VThe seventh grader said, "What's humidity?"
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd I said, "Oh, it's water in air."
p333
aa(lp334
VHe said, "There's no water in air, you're an idiot."
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd I was like, "Alright, don't trust me.
p339
aVActually \u2014 don't trust me, right?
p340
aVSet it to 100.
p341
aVHe sets it to 100 and what happens?
p342
aVIt starts to condense, make a fog and eventually drip.
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain.
p345
aVWhy didn't you just tell me that?"
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VWe've created an interface for this that's much like a game.
p350
aVThey have a 3D environment,
p351
aVthey can log into it anywhere in the world
p352
aVon their smartphone, on their tablet.
p353
aVThey have different parts of the bots \u2014 the physical, the sensors.
p354
aVThey select recipes that have been created by other kids
p355
aVanywhere in the world.
p356
aVThey select and activate that recipe, they plant a seedling.
p357
aVWhile it's growing, they make changes.
p358
aVThey're like, "Why does a plant need CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad?
p359
aVIt kills people."
p360
aVCrank up CO2, plant dies.
p361
aVOr crank down CO2, plant does very well.
p362
aVHarvest plant,
p363
aVand you've created a new digital recipe.
p364
aa(lp365
VIt's an iterative design and development
p366
aVand exploration process.
p367
aVThey can download, then,
p368
aVall of the data about that new plant that they developed
p369
aVor the new digital recipe and what did it do \u2014
p370
aVwas it better or was it worse?
p371
aVImagine these as little cores of processing.
p372
aVWe're going to learn so much.
p373
aa(lp374
VHere's one of the food computers, as we call them,
p375
aVin a school in three weeks' time.
p376
aVThis is three weeks of growth.
p377
aVBut more importantly,
p378
aVit was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer \u2014
p379
aVor that he would want to be a farmer.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo, we've open-sourced all of this.
p382
aVIt's all online; go home, try to build your first food computer.
p383
aVIt's going to be difficult \u2014 I'm just telling you.
p384
aVWe're in the beginning, but it's all there.
p385
aVIt's very important to me that this is easily accessible.
p386
aVWe're going to keep making it more so.
p387
aa(lp388
VThese are farmers,
p389
aVelectrical engineer, mechanical engineer,
p390
aVenvironmental engineer, computer scientist,
p391
aVplant scientist, economist, urban planners.
p392
aVOn one platform, doing what they're good at.
p393
aVBut we got a little too big.
p394
aa(lp395
VThis is my new facility that I'm just starting.
p396
aVThis warehouse could be anywhere.
p397
aVThat's why I chose it.
p398
aVAnd inside of this warehouse
p399
aVwe're going to build something kind of like this.
p400
aVThese exist right now.
p401
aVTake a look at it.
p402
aVThese exist, too.
p403
aVOne grows greens,
p404
aVone grows Ebola vaccine.
p405
aVPretty amazing that plants and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner
p406
aVis one of the reasons we're getting ahead of Ebola.
p407
aVThe plants are producing the protein that's Ebola resistant.
p408
aVSo pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals,
p409
aVall they way down to lettuce.
p410
aa(lp411
VBut these two things look nothing alike,
p412
aVand that's where I am with my field.
p413
aVEverything is different.
p414
aVWe're in that weird "We're alright" stage
p415
aVand it's like, "Here's my black box \u2014"
p416
aV"No, buy mine."
p417
aV"No, no, no \u2014 I've got intellectual property that's totally valuable.
p418
aVDon't buy his, buy mine."
p419
aa(lp420
VAnd the reality is, we're just at the beginning,
p421
aVin a time when society is shifting, too.
p422
aVWhen we ask for more, cheaper food,
p423
aVwe're now asking for better, environmentally friendly food.
p424
aVAnd when you have McDonald's advertising what's in the Chicken McNugget,
p425
aVthe most mysterious food item of all time \u2014
p426
aVthey are now basing their marketing plan on that \u2014
p427
aVeverything is changing.
p428
aa(lp429
VSo into the world now.
p430
aVPersonal food computers,
p431
aVfood servers
p432
aVand food data centers
p433
aVrun on the open phenome.
p434
aVThink open genome, but we're going to put little climate recipes,
p435
aVlike Wikipedia,
p436
aVthat you can pull down, actuate and grow.
p437
aa(lp438
VWhat does this look like in a world?
p439
aVYou remember the world connected by strings?
p440
aVWe start having beacons.
p441
aVWe start sending information about food,
p442
aVrather than sending food.
p443
aVThis is not just my fantasy,
p444
aVthis is where we're already deploying.
p445
aVFood computers, food servers,
p446
aVsoon-to-be food data centers,
p447
aVconnecting people together to share information.
p448
aa(lp449
VThe future of food is not about fighting over what's wrong with this.
p450
aVWe know what's wrong with this.
p451
aVThe future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers
p452
aVand empowering them with a platform
p453
aVto ask and answer the question,
p454
aV"What if?"
p455
aa(lp456
VThank you.

VCould I protect my father
p5
aVfrom the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife?
p6
aVThat was the question I faced
p7
aVone Tuesday morning in June of 1993,
p8
aVwhen I was a law student.
p9
aa(lp10
VI woke up early that morning
p11
aVin Dad's apartment
p12
aVon the outskirts of Algiers, Algeria,
p13
aVto an unrelenting pounding on the front door.
p14
aVIt was a season as described by a local paper
p15
aVwhen every Tuesday a scholar fell
p16
aVto the bullets of fundamentalist assassins.
p17
aVMy father's university teaching of Darwin
p18
aVhad already provoked a classroom visit
p19
aVfrom the head of the so-called Islamic Salvation Front,
p20
aVwho denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism
p21
aVbefore Dad had ejected the man,
p22
aVand now whoever was outside
p23
aVwould neither identify himself nor go away.
p24
aVSo my father tried to get the police on the phone,
p25
aVbut perhaps terrified by the rising tide
p26
aVof armed extremism that had already claimed
p27
aVthe lives of so many Algerian officers,
p28
aVthey didn't even answer.
p29
aVAnd that was when I went to the kitchen,
p30
aVgot out a paring knife,
p31
aVand took up a position inside the entryway.
p32
aVIt was a ridiculous thing to do, really,
p33
aVbut I couldn't think of anything else,
p34
aVand so there I stood.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhen I look back now, I think that that was the moment
p37
aVthat set me on the path was to writing a book
p38
aVcalled "Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here:
p39
aVUntold Stories from the Fight Against Muslim Fundamentalism."
p40
aVThe title comes from a Pakistani play.
p41
aVI think it was actually that moment
p42
aVthat sent me on the journey
p43
aVto interview 300 people of Muslim heritage
p44
aVfrom nearly 30 countries,
p45
aVfrom Afghanistan to Mali,
p46
aVto find out how they fought fundamentalism
p47
aVpeacefully like my father did,
p48
aVand how they coped with the attendant risks.
p49
aa(lp50
VLuckily, back in June of 1993,
p51
aVour unidentified visitor went away,
p52
aVbut other families were so much less lucky,
p53
aVand that was the thought that motivated my research.
p54
aVIn any case, someone would return
p55
aVa few months later and leave a note
p56
aVon Dad's kitchen table,
p57
aVwhich simply said, "Consider yourself dead."
p58
aVSubsequently, Algeria's fundamentalist armed groups
p59
aVwould murder as many as 200,000 civilians
p60
aVin what came to be known
p61
aVas the dark decade of the 1990s,
p62
aVincluding every single one
p63
aVof the women that you see here.
p64
aVIn its harsh counterterrorist response,
p65
aVthe state resorted to torture
p66
aVand to forced disappearances,
p67
aVand as terrible as all of these events became,
p68
aVthe international community largely ignored them.
p69
aVFinally, my father, an Algerian peasant's son turned professor,
p70
aVwas forced to stop teaching at the university
p71
aVand to flee his apartment,
p72
aVbut what I will never forget
p73
aVabout Mahfoud Bennoune, my dad,
p74
aVwas that like so many other Algerian intellectuals,
p75
aVhe refused to leave the country
p76
aVand he continued to publish pointed criticisms,
p77
aVboth of the fundamentalists
p78
aVand sometimes of the government they battled.
p79
aVFor example, in a November 1994 series
p80
aVin the newspaper El Watan
p81
aVentitled "How Fundamentalism
p82
aVProduced a Terrorism without Precedent,"
p83
aVhe denounced what he called
p84
aVthe terrorists' radical break with the true Islam
p85
aVas it was lived by our ancestors.
p86
aVThese were words that could get you killed.
p87
aa(lp88
VMy father's country taught me
p89
aVin that dark decade of the 1990s that
p90
aVthe popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism
p91
aVis one of the most important
p92
aVand overlooked human rights struggles
p93
aVin the world.
p94
aVThis remains true today, nearly 20 years later.
p95
aVYou see, in every country
p96
aVwhere you hear about armed jihadis
p97
aVtargeting civilians,
p98
aVthere are also unarmed people
p99
aVdefying those militants that you don't hear about,
p100
aVand those people need our support to succeed.
p101
aa(lp102
VIn the West, it's often assumed
p103
aVthat Muslims generally condone terrorism.
p104
aVSome on the right think this because they view
p105
aVMuslim culture as inherently violent,
p106
aVand some on the left imagine this
p107
aVbecause they view Muslim violence,
p108
aVfundamentalist violence,
p109
aVsolely as a product of legitimate grievances.
p110
aVBut both views are dead wrong.
p111
aVIn fact, many people of Muslim heritage
p112
aVaround the world are staunch opponents
p113
aVboth of fundamentalism and of terrorism,
p114
aVand often for very good reason.
p115
aVYou see, they're much more likely to be victims
p116
aVof this violence than its perpetrators.
p117
aVLet me just give you one example.
p118
aVAccording to a 2009 survey
p119
aVof Arabic language media resources,
p120
aVbetween 2004 and 2008,
p121
aVno more than 15 percent of al Qaeda's victims
p122
aVwere Westerners.
p123
aVThat's a terrible toll, but the vast majority
p124
aVwere people of Muslim heritage,
p125
aVkilled by Muslim fundamentalists.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow I've been talking for the last five minutes
p128
aVabout fundamentalism, and you have a right to know
p129
aVexactly what I mean.
p130
aVI cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist
p131
aVMarieme Helie Lucas,
p132
aVand she says that fundamentalisms,
p133
aVnote the "s," so within all of the world's
p134
aVgreat religious traditions,
p135
aV"fundamentalisms are political movements of the extreme right
p136
aVwhich in a context of globalization
p137
aVmanipulate religion in order to achieve
p138
aVtheir political aims."
p139
aVSadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization
p140
aVof theology.
p141
aVNow I want to avoid projecting the notion
p142
aVthat there's sort of a monolith out there
p143
aVcalled Muslim fundamentalism that is the same everywhere,
p144
aVbecause these movements also have their diversities.
p145
aVSome use and advocate violence.
p146
aVSome do not, though they're often interrelated.
p147
aVThey take different forms.
p148
aVSome may be non-governmental organizations,
p149
aVeven here in Britain like Cageprisoners.
p150
aVSome may become political parties,
p151
aVlike the Muslim Brotherhood,
p152
aVand some may be openly armed groups
p153
aVlike the Taliban.
p154
aVBut in any case, these are all radical projects.
p155
aVThey're not conservative or traditional approaches.
p156
aVThey're most often about changing people's relationship with Islam
p157
aVrather than preserving it.
p158
aVWhat I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right,
p159
aVand the fact that its adherents are
p160
aVor purport to be Muslim
p161
aVmakes them no less offensive
p162
aVthan the extreme right anywhere else.
p163
aVSo in my view, if we consider ourselves
p164
aVliberal or left-wing,
p165
aVhuman rights-loving or feminist,
p166
aVwe must oppose these movements
p167
aVand support their grassroots opponents.
p168
aVNow let me be clear
p169
aVthat I support an effective struggle
p170
aVagainst fundamentalism,
p171
aVbut also a struggle that must itself
p172
aVrespect international law,
p173
aVso nothing I am saying should be taken
p174
aVas a justification for refusals
p175
aVto democratize,
p176
aVand here I send out a shout-out of support
p177
aVto the pro-democracy movement  in Algeria today, Barakat.
p178
aVNor should anything I say be taken
p179
aVas a justification of violations of human rights,
p180
aVlike the mass death sentences
p181
aVhanded out in Egypt earlier this week.
p182
aVBut what I am saying
p183
aVis that we must challenge these Muslim fundamentalist movements
p184
aVbecause they threaten human rights
p185
aVacross Muslim-majority contexts,
p186
aVand they do this in a range of ways,
p187
aVmost obviously with the direct attacks on civilians
p188
aVby the armed groups that carry those out.
p189
aVBut that violence is just the tip of the iceberg.
p190
aVThese movements as a whole purvey discrimination
p191
aVagainst religious minorities and sexual minorities.
p192
aVThey seek to curtail the freedom of religion
p193
aVof everyone who either practices in a different way
p194
aVor chooses not to practice.
p195
aVAnd most definingly, they lead an all-out war
p196
aVon the rights of women.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, faced with these movements
p199
aVin recent years, Western discourse
p200
aVhas most often offered
p201
aVtwo flawed responses.
p202
aVThe first that one sometimes finds on the right
p203
aVsuggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist
p204
aVor something about Islam is inherently fundamentalist,
p205
aVand this is just offensive and wrong,
p206
aVbut unfortunately on the left one sometimes encounters
p207
aVa discourse that is too politically correct
p208
aVto acknowledge the problem of Muslim fundamentalism at all
p209
aVor, even worse, apologizes for it,
p210
aVand this is unacceptable as well.
p211
aVSo what I'm seeking is a new way
p212
aVof talking about this all together,
p213
aVwhich is grounded in the lived experiences
p214
aVand the hope of the people on the front lines.
p215
aVI'm painfully aware that there has been
p216
aVan increase in discrimination against Muslims in recent years
p217
aVin countries like the U.K. and the U.S.,
p218
aVand that too is a matter of grave concern,
p219
aVbut I firmly believe
p220
aVthat telling these counter-stereotypical stories
p221
aVof people of Muslim heritage
p222
aVwho have confronted the fundamentalists
p223
aVand been their primary victims
p224
aVis also a great way of countering that discrimination.
p225
aVSo now let me introduce you
p226
aVto four people whose stories
p227
aVI had the great honor of telling.
p228
aa(lp229
VFaizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre
p230
aVworkshop named for his father
p231
aVhave for years promoted the performing arts
p232
aVin Pakistan.
p233
aVWith the rise of jihadist violence,
p234
aVthey began to receive threats
p235
aVto call off their events, which they refused to heed.
p236
aVAnd so a bomber struck their 2008
p237
aVeighth world performing arts festival in Lahore,
p238
aVproducing rain of glass
p239
aVthat fell into the venue
p240
aVinjuring nine people,
p241
aVand later that same night,
p242
aVthe Peerzadas made a very difficult decision:
p243
aVthey announced that their festival
p244
aVwould continue as planned the next day.
p245
aVAs Faizan said at the time,
p246
aVif we bow down to the Islamists,
p247
aVwe'll just be sitting in a dark corner.
p248
aVBut they didn't know what would happen.
p249
aVWould anyone come?
p250
aVIn fact, thousands of people came out the next day
p251
aVto support the performing arts in Lahore,
p252
aVand this simultaneously thrilled
p253
aVand terrified Faizan,
p254
aVand he ran up to a woman
p255
aVwho had come in with her two small children,
p256
aVand he said, "You do know there was a bomb here yesterday,
p257
aVand you do know there's a threat here today."
p258
aVAnd she said, "I know that,
p259
aVbut I came to your festival
p260
aVwith my mother when I was their age,
p261
aVand I still have those images in my mind.
p262
aVWe have to be here."
p263
aVWith stalwart audiences like this,
p264
aVthe Peerzadas were able to conclude
p265
aVtheir festival on schedule.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd then the next year,
p268
aVthey lost all of their sponsors
p269
aVdue to the security risk.
p270
aVSo when I met them in 2010,
p271
aVthey were in the middle of the first subsequent event
p272
aVthat they were able to have in the same venue,
p273
aVand this was the ninth youth performing arts festival
p274
aVheld in Lahore in a year when that city
p275
aVhad already experienced 44 terror attacks.
p276
aVThis was a time when the Pakistani Taliban
p277
aVhad commenced their systematic targeting
p278
aVof girls' schools that would culminate
p279
aVin the attack on Malala Yousafzai.
p280
aVWhat did the Peerzadas do in that environment?
p281
aVThey staged girls' school theater.
p282
aVSo I had the privilege of watching "Naang Wal,"
p283
aVwhich was a musical in the Punjabi language,
p284
aVand the girls of Lahore Grammar School
p285
aVplayed all the parts.
p286
aVThey sang and danced,
p287
aVthey played the mice and the water buffalo,
p288
aVand I held my breath, wondering,
p289
aVwould we get to the end
p290
aVof this amazing show?
p291
aVAnd when we did, the whole audience
p292
aVcollectively exhaled,
p293
aVand a few people actually wept,
p294
aVand then they filled the auditorium
p295
aVwith the peaceful boom of their applause.
p296
aVAnd I remember thinking in that moment
p297
aVthat the bombers made headlines here
p298
aVtwo years before
p299
aVbut this night and these people
p300
aVare as important a story.
p301
aa(lp302
VMaria Bashir is the first and only
p303
aVwoman chief prosecutor in Afghanistan.
p304
aVShe's been in the post since 2008
p305
aVand actually opened an office to investigate
p306
aVcases of violence against women,
p307
aVwhich she says is the most important area
p308
aVin her mandate.
p309
aVWhen I meet her in her office in Herat,
p310
aVshe enters surrounded by
p311
aVfour large men with four huge guns.
p312
aVIn fact, she now has 23 bodyguards,
p313
aVbecause she has weathered bomb attacks
p314
aVthat nearly killed her kids,
p315
aVand it took the leg off of one of her guards.
p316
aa(lp317
VWhy does she continue?
p318
aVShe says with a smile that that is the question
p319
aVthat everyone asks\u2014
p320
aVas she puts it, "Why you risk not living?"
p321
aVAnd it is simply that for her,
p322
aVa better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come
p323
aVis worth the risk,
p324
aVand she knows that if people like her
p325
aVdo not take the risk,
p326
aVthere will be no better future.
p327
aVLater on in our interview,
p328
aVProsecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is
p329
aVabout the possible outcome
p330
aVof government negotiations with the Taliban,
p331
aVthe people who have been trying to kill her.
p332
aV"If we give them a place in the government,"
p333
aVshe asks, "Who will protect women's rights?"
p334
aVAnd she urges the international community
p335
aVnot to forget its promise about women
p336
aVbecause now they want peace with Taliban.
p337
aVA few weeks after I leave Afghanistan,
p338
aVI see a headline on the Internet.
p339
aVAn Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated.
p340
aVI google desperately,
p341
aVand thankfully that day I find out
p342
aVthat Maria was not the victim,
p343
aVthough sadly, another Afghan prosecutor
p344
aVwas gunned down on his way to work.
p345
aVAnd when I hear headlines like that now,
p346
aVI think that as international troops
p347
aVleave Afghanistan this year and beyond,
p348
aVwe must continue to care
p349
aVabout what happens to people there,
p350
aVto all of the Maria Bashirs.
p351
aVSometimes I still hear her voice in my head
p352
aVsaying, with no bravado whatsoever,
p353
aV"The situation of the women of Afghanistan
p354
aVwill be better someday.
p355
aVWe should prepare the ground for this,
p356
aVeven if we are killed."
p357
aa(lp358
VThere are no words adequate
p359
aVto denounce the al Shabaab terrorists
p360
aVwho attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi
p361
aVon the same day as a children's cooking competition
p362
aVin September of 2013.
p363
aVThey killed 67, including poets and pregnant women.
p364
aVFar away in the American Midwest,
p365
aVI had the good fortune of meeting Somali-Americans
p366
aVwho were working to counter the efforts of al Shabaab
p367
aVto recruit a small number of young people
p368
aVfrom their city of Minneapolis
p369
aVto take part in atrocities like Westgate.
p370
aVAbdirizak Bihi's studious
p371
aV17-year-old nephew Burhan Hassan
p372
aVwas recruited here in 2008,
p373
aVspirited to Somalia,
p374
aVand then killed when he tried to come home.
p375
aVSince that time, Mr. Bihi,
p376
aVwho directs the no-budget Somali Education and Advocacy Center,
p377
aVhas been vocally denouncing the recruitment
p378
aVand the failures of government
p379
aVand Somali-American institutions
p380
aVlike the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center
p381
aVwhere he believes his nephew was radicalized
p382
aVduring a youth program.
p383
aVBut he doesn't just criticize the mosque.
p384
aVHe also takes on the government
p385
aVfor its failure to do more
p386
aVto prevent poverty in his community.
p387
aVGiven his own lack of financial resources,
p388
aVMr. Bihi has had to be creative.
p389
aVTo counter the efforts of al Shabaab
p390
aVto sway more disaffected youth,
p391
aVin the wake of the group's 2010 attack
p392
aVon World Cup viewers in Uganda,
p393
aVhe organized a Ramadan basketball tournament
p394
aVin Minneapolis in response.
p395
aVScores of Somali-American kids came out
p396
aVto embrace sport
p397
aVdespite the fatwa against it.
p398
aVThey played basketball
p399
aVas Burhan Hassan never would again.
p400
aVFor his efforts, Mr. Bihi has been ostracized
p401
aVby the leadership of the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center,
p402
aVwith which he used to have good relations.
p403
aVHe told me, "One day we saw the imam on TV
p404
aVcalling us infidels and saying,
p405
aV'These families are trying to destroy the mosque.'"
p406
aVThis is at complete odds
p407
aVwith how Abdirizak Bihi understands
p408
aVwhat he is trying to do
p409
aVby exposing al Shabaab recruitment,
p410
aVwhich is to save the religion I love
p411
aVfrom a small number of extremists.
p412
aa(lp413
VNow I want to tell one last story,
p414
aVthat of a 22-year-old law student in Algeria
p415
aVnamed Amel Zenoune-Zouani
p416
aVwho had the same dreams of a legal career
p417
aVthat I did back in the '90s.
p418
aVShe refused to give up her studies,
p419
aVdespite the fact that the fundamentalists
p420
aVbattling the Algerian state back then
p421
aVthreatened all who continued their education.
p422
aVOn January 26, 1997, Amel boarded the bus
p423
aVin Algiers where she was studying
p424
aVto go home and spend a Ramadan evening
p425
aVwith her family,
p426
aVand would never finish law school.
p427
aVWhen the bus reached the outskirts
p428
aVof her hometown, it was stopped
p429
aVat a checkpoint manned by men
p430
aVfrom the Armed Islamic Group.
p431
aVCarrying her schoolbag,
p432
aVAmel was taken off the bus
p433
aVand killed in the street.
p434
aVThe men who cut her throat
p435
aVthen told everyone else,
p436
aV"If you go to university,
p437
aVthe day will come when we will kill all of you
p438
aVjust like this."
p439
aa(lp440
VAmel died at exactly 5:17 p.m.,
p441
aVwhich we know because when she fell in the street,
p442
aVher watch broke.
p443
aVHer mother showed me the watch
p444
aVwith the second hand still aimed
p445
aVoptimistically upward
p446
aVtowards a 5:18 that would never come.
p447
aVShortly before her death,
p448
aVAmel had said to her mother of herself
p449
aVand her sisters,
p450
aV"Nothing will happen to us, Inshallah, God willing,
p451
aVbut if something happens,
p452
aVyou must know that we are dead for knowledge.
p453
aVYou and father must keep your heads held high."
p454
aa(lp455
VThe loss of such a young woman is unfathomable,
p456
aVand so as I did my research
p457
aVI found myself searching for Amel's hope again
p458
aVand her name even means "hope" in Arabic.
p459
aVI think I found it in two places.
p460
aVThe first is in the strength of her family
p461
aVand all the other families to continue telling their stories
p462
aVand to go on with their lives despite the terrorism.
p463
aVIn fact, Amel's sister Lamia overcame her grief,
p464
aVwent to law school,
p465
aVand practices as a lawyer in Algiers today,
p466
aVsomething which is only possible
p467
aVbecause the armed fundamentalists
p468
aVwere largely defeated in the country.
p469
aVAnd the second place I found Amel's hope
p470
aVwas everywhere that women and men
p471
aVcontinue to defy the jihadis.
p472
aVWe must support all of those in honor of Amel
p473
aVwho continue this human rights struggle today,
p474
aVlike the Network of Women Living Under Muslim Laws.
p475
aVIt is not enough, as the victims rights advocate
p476
aVCherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers,
p477
aVit is not enough just to battle terrorism.
p478
aVWe must also challenge fundamentalism,
p479
aVbecause fundamentalism is the ideology
p480

The topic of her most recent publication &lsquo;Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here&rsquo; is a very personal one for her. Her father Mahfoud Bennoune was an outspoken professor at the University of Algiers, and faced death threats during the 1990s, but continued speaking out against fundamentalism and terrorism. In writing this book, Karima set out to meet people who are today doing what her father did back then, to try to garner for them greater international support than Algerian democrats received during the 1990s.<br /><br />She has served as a member of the Executive Council of the American Society of International Law and on the board of directors of Amnesty International USA. Currently, she sits on the Board of the Network of Women Living Under Muslim Laws. She has also been a consultant on human rights issues for the International Council on Human Rights Policy, the Soros Foundation, the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, and for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

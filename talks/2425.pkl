VYou may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone
p5
aVor Arua, Nigeria.
p6
aVBut I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.
p7
aa(lp8
VIn hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists
p9
aVthat have been quietly battling
p10
aVone of the deadliest threats to humanity for years:
p11
aVLassa virus.
p12
aVLassa virus is a lot like Ebola.
p13
aVIt can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal.
p14
aVBut these individuals, they risk their lives every day
p15
aVto protect the individuals in their communities,
p16
aVand by doing so, protect us all.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them
p19
aVon one of my first visits out there many years ago
p20
aVwas that they start each morning \u2014
p21
aVthese challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines \u2014 by singing.
p22
aVThey gather together, and they show their joy.
p23
aVThey show their spirit.
p24
aVAnd over the years,
p25
aVfrom year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me,
p26
aVI get to gather with them and I sing
p27
aVand we write and we love it,
p28
aVbecause it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together;
p29
aVwe're bonded through a shared humanity.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important,
p32
aVeven essential, as things begin to change.
p33
aVAnd that changed a great deal in March of 2014,
p34
aVwhen the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
p35
aVThis is the first outbreak in West Africa,
p36
aVnear the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
p37
aVAnd it was frightening, frightening for us all.
p38
aVWe had actually suspected for some time
p39
aVthat Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought,
p40
aVand we thought it could one day come to Kenema.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd so members of my team immediately went out
p43
aVand joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there,
p44
aVand we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests
p45
aVto pick up Ebola if it came across the border
p46
aVand into Sierra Leone.
p47
aVWe'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus,
p48
aVwe knew how to do it,
p49
aVthe team is outstanding.
p50
aVWe just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd unfortunately, that day came.
p53
aVOn May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital,
p54
aVand the team ran those important molecular tests
p55
aVand they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
p56
aVThis was an exceptional work that was done.
p57
aVThey were able to diagnose the case immediately,
p58
aVto safely treat the patient
p59
aVand to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on.
p60
aVIt could've stopped something.
p61
aVBut by the time that day came,
p62
aVthe outbreak had already been breeding for months.
p63
aVWith hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks.
p64
aVAnd it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case,
p65
aVbut as a tidal wave.
p66
aa(lp67
VWe had to work with the international community,
p68
aVwith the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases,
p69
aVas the next week brought 31,
p70
aVthen 92, then 147 cases \u2014 all coming to Kenema,
p71
aVone of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could,
p74
aVtrying to help the individuals, trying to get attention,
p75
aVbut we also did one other simple thing.
p76
aVFrom that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola,
p77
aVwe can discard it, obviously.
p78
aVThe other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it,
p79
aVso just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean,
p80
aVand that's what we did.
p81
aVWe sent it to Boston, where my team works.
p82
aVAnd we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day,
p83
aVand we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
p84
aVThis is the blueprint \u2014 the genome of a virus is the blueprint.
p85
aVWe all have one.
p86
aVIt says everything that makes up us,
p87
aVand it tells us so much information.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful.
p90
aVWe could actually take these 99 different viruses,
p91
aVlook at them and compare them,
p92
aVand we could see, actually, compared to three genomes
p93
aVthat had been previously published from Guinea,
p94
aVwe could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before,
p95
aVonce into the human population,
p96
aVand from there had been transmitting from human to human.
p97
aVNow, that's incredibly important
p98
aVwhen you're trying to figure out how to intervene,
p99
aVbut the important thing is contact tracing.
p100
aVWe also could see that as the virus was moving between humans,
p101
aVit was mutating.
p102
aVAnd each of those mutations are so important,
p103
aVbecause the diagnostics, the vaccines,
p104
aVthe therapies that we're using,
p105
aVare all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally \u2014
p106
aVthat's what drives it.
p107
aVAnd so global health experts would need to respond,
p108
aVwould have to develop,
p109
aVto recalibrate everything that they were doing.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut the way that science works, the position I was in at that point
p112
aVis, I had the data,
p113
aVand I could have worked in a silo for many, many months,
p114
aVanalyzed the data carefully, slowly,
p115
aVsubmitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths,
p116
aVand then finally when the paper came out, might release that data.
p117
aVThat's the way the status quo works.
p118
aa(lp119
VWell, that was not going to work at this point, right?
p120
aVWe had friends on the front lines
p121
aVand to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help,
p122
aVlots of help.
p123
aVSo the first thing we did is,
p124
aVas soon as the sequences came off the machines,
p125
aVwe published it to the web.
p126
aVWe just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us."
p127
aVAnd help came.
p128
aa(lp129
VBefore we knew it,
p130
aVwe were being contacted from people all over,
p131
aVsurprised to see the data out there and released.
p132
aVSome of the greatest viral trackers in the world
p133
aVwere suddenly part of our community.
p134
aVWe were working together in this virtual way,
p135
aVsharing, regular calls, communications,
p136
aVtrying to follow the virus minute by minute,
p137
aVto see ways that we could stop it.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd there are so many ways that we can form communities like that.
p140
aVEverybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally,
p141
aVwas reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage.
p142
aVEverybody wants to play a part.
p143
aVThe amount of human capacity out there is just amazing,
p144
aVand the Internet connects us all.
p145
aVAnd could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other,
p146
aVthat we all just said, "Let's do this.
p147
aVLet's work together, and let's make this happen."
p148
aa(lp149
VBut the problem is that the data that all of us are using,
p150
aVGoogling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do.
p151
aVAnd so many opportunities get missed when that happens.
p152
aVSo in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema,
p153
aVwe'd had 106 clinical records from patients,
p154
aVand we once again made that publicly available to the world.
p155
aVAnd in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records,
p156
aVwe could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients
p157
aVto near 100 percent accuracy.
p158
aVAnd we made an app that could release that,
p159
aVto make that available to health-care workers in the field.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut 106 is just not enough to make it powerful,
p162
aVto validate it.
p163
aVSo we were waiting for more data to release that.
p164
aVand the data has still not come.
p165
aVWe are still waiting, tweaking away,
p166
aVin silos rather than working together.
p167
aVAnd this just \u2014 we can't accept that.
p168
aVRight? You, all of you, cannot accept that.
p169
aVIt's our lives on the line.
p170
aVAnd in fact, actually,
p171
aVmany lives were lost, many health-care workers,
p172
aVincluding beloved colleagues of mine,
p173
aVfive colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi,
p174
aVDr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah.
p175
aVThese are just five of many health-care workers
p176
aVat Kenema and beyond
p177
aVthat died while the world waited and while we all worked,
p178
aVquietly and separately.
p179
aa(lp180
VSee, Ebola, like all threats to humanity,
p181
aVit's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division.
p182
aVWhen we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves,
p183
aVthe virus thrives.
p184
aVBut unlike all threats to humanity,
p185
aVEbola is one where we're actually all the same.
p186
aVWe're all in this fight together.
p187
aVEbola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours.
p188
aVAnd so in this place with the same vulnerabilities,
p189
aVthe same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes,
p190
aVI hope that we work together with joy.
p191
aa(lp192
VA graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone,
p193
aVand she discovered that the word "Kenema,"
p194
aVthe hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone,
p195
aVis named after the Mende word for "clear like a river, translucent
p196
aVand open to the public gaze."
p197
aVThat was really profound for us,
p198
aVbecause without knowing it, we'd always felt
p199
aVthat in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked,
p200
aVwe had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together.
p201
aVAnd we have to do that.
p202
aVWe all have to demand that of ourselves and others \u2014
p203
aVto be open to each other when an outbreak happens,
p204
aVto fight in this fight together.
p205
aVBecause this is not the first outbreak of Ebola,
p206
aVit will not be the last,
p207
aVand there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait,
p208
aVlike Lassa virus and others.
p209
aVAnd the next time this happens,
p210
aVit could happen in a city of millions, it could start there.
p211
aVIt could be something that's transmitted through the air.
p212
aVIt could even be disseminated intentionally.
p213
aVAnd I know that that is frightening, I understand that,
p214
aVbut I know also, and this experience shows us,
p215
aVthat we have the technology and we have the capacity
p216
aVto win this thing,
p217
aVto win this and have the upper hand over viruses.
p218
aVBut we can only do it if we do it together
p219
aVand we do it with joy.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo for Dr. Khan
p222
aVand for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines
p223
aVin this fight with us always,
p224
aVlet us be in this fight with them always.
p225
aVAnd let us not let the world be defined
p226
aVby the destruction wrought by one virus,
p227
aVbut illuminated by billions of hearts and minds
p228
aVworking in unity.
p229
aa(lp230
VThank you.

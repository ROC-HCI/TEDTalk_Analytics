V(Video) Nicholas Negroponte:  Can we switch to the video disc,
p5
aVwhich is in play mode?
p6
aa(lp7
VI'm really interested in how you put people and computers together.
p8
aVWe will be using the TV screens or their equivalents
p9
aVfor electronic books of the future.
p10
aV(Music, crosstalk)
p11
aVVery interested in touch-sensitive displays,
p12
aVhigh-tech, high-touch, not having to pick up your fingers to use them.
p13
aVThere is another way where computers
p14
aVtouch people: wearing, physically wearing.
p15
aVSuddenly on September 11th,
p16
aVthe world got bigger.
p17
aa(lp18
VNN: Thank you. (Applause)
p19
aa(lp20
VThank you.
p21
aa(lp22
VWhen I was asked to do this,
p23
aVI was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks
p24
aVthat I had given,
p25
aVchronologically.
p26
aVThe first one was actually two hours.
p27
aVThe second one was an hour,
p28
aVand then they became half hours,
p29
aVand all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVImagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by,
p32
aVand it was, to say the least,
p33
aVfor me, quite a shocking experience.
p34
aVSo what I'm going to do in my time
p35
aVis try and share with you what happened
p36
aVduring the 30 years,
p37
aVand then also make a prediction,
p38
aVand then tell you a little bit
p39
aVabout what I'm doing next.
p40
aVAnd I put on a slide
p41
aVwhere TED 1 happened in my life.
p42
aVAnd it's rather important
p43
aVbecause I had done 15 years of research before it,
p44
aVso I had a backlog, so it was easy.
p45
aVIt's not that I was Fidel Castro
p46
aVand I could talk for two hours,
p47
aVor Bucky Fuller.
p48
aVI had 15 years of stuff,
p49
aVand the Media Lab was about to start.
p50
aVSo that was easy.
p51
aa(lp52
VBut there are a couple of things
p53
aVabout that period
p54
aVand about what happened that are
p55
aVreally quite important.
p56
aVOne is that
p57
aVit was a period when computers
p58
aVweren't yet for people.
p59
aVAnd the other thing that sort of happened
p60
aVduring that time is that
p61
aVwe were considered sissy computer scientists.
p62
aVWe weren't considered the real thing.
p63
aVSo what I'm going to show you is, in retrospect,
p64
aVa lot more interesting and a lot more accepted
p65
aVthan it was at the time.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo I'm going to characterize the years
p68
aVand I'm even going to go back
p69
aVto some very early work of mine,
p70
aVand this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '60s:
p71
aVvery direct manipulation,
p72
aVvery influenced as I studied architecture
p73
aVby the architect Moshe Safdie,
p74
aVand you can see that we even built robotic things
p75
aVthat could build habitat-like structures.
p76
aVAnd this for me was
p77
aVnot yet the Media Lab,
p78
aVbut was the beginning of what I'll call
p79
aVsensory computing,
p80
aVand I pick fingers
p81
aVpartly because everybody thought it was ridiculous.
p82
aVPapers were published
p83
aVabout how stupid it was to use fingers.
p84
aVThree reasons: One was they were low-resolution.
p85
aVThe other is your hand would occlude
p86
aVwhat you wanted to see,
p87
aVand the third, which was the winner,
p88
aVwas that your fingers would get the screen dirty,
p89
aVand hence, fingers would never be
p90
aVa device that you'd use.
p91
aVAnd this was a device we built in the '70s,
p92
aVwhich has never even been picked up.
p93
aVIt's not just touch sensitive,
p94
aVit's pressure sensitive.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Video) Voice: Put a yellow circle there.
p97
aa(lp98
VNN: Later work, and again this was before TED 1 \u2014
p99
aa(lp100
V(Video) Voice: Move that west of the diamond.
p101
aVCreate a large green circle there.
p102
aVMan: Aw, shit.
p103
aa(lp104
VNN: \u2014 was to sort of do interface concurrently,
p105
aVso when you talked and you pointed
p106
aVand you had, if you will,
p107
aVmultiple channels.
p108
aa(lp109
VEntebbe happened.
p110
aV1976, Air France was hijacked,
p111
aVtaken to Entebbe,
p112
aVand the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue,
p113
aVthey did it partly because they had practiced
p114
aVon a physical model of the airport,
p115
aVbecause they had built the airport,
p116
aVso they built a model in the desert,
p117
aVand when they arrived at Entebbe,
p118
aVthey knew where to go because they had actually been there.
p119
aVThe U.S. government asked some of us, '76,
p120
aVif we could replicate that computationally,
p121
aVand of course somebody like myself says yes.
p122
aVImmediately, you get a contract,
p123
aVDepartment of Defense,
p124
aVand we built this truck and this rig.
p125
aVWe did sort of a simulation,
p126
aVbecause you had video discs,
p127
aVand again, this is '76.
p128
aVAnd then many years later,
p129
aVyou get this truck,
p130
aVand so you have Google Maps.
p131
aa(lp132
VStill people thought,
p133
aVno, that was not serious computer science,
p134
aVand it was a man named Jerry Wiesner,
p135
aVwho happened to be the president of MIT,
p136
aVwho did think it was computer science.
p137
aVAnd one of the keys for anybody
p138
aVwho wants to start something in life:
p139
aVMake sure your president is part of it.
p140
aVSo when I was doing the Media Lab,
p141
aVit was like having a gorilla in the front seat.
p142
aVIf you were stopped for speeding
p143
aVand the officer looked in the window
p144
aVand saw who was in the passenger seat,
p145
aVthen, "Oh, continue on, sir."
p146
aVAnd so we were able,
p147
aVand this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically.
p148
aVThis was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner
p149
aVwhere the only thing that changed in the photograph
p150
aVwere the lips.
p151
aVSo when you oscillated that little piece
p152
aVof lenticular sheet with his photograph,
p153
aVit would be in lip sync
p154
aVwith zero bandwidth.
p155
aVIt was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system
p156
aVat the time.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo this was the Media Lab's \u2014
p159
aVthis is what we said we'd do,
p160
aVthat the world of computers, publishing,
p161
aVand so on would come together.
p162
aVAgain, not generally accepted,
p163
aVbut very much part of TED in the early days.
p164
aVAnd this is really where we were headed.
p165
aVAnd that created the Media Lab.
p166
aVOne of the things about age
p167
aVis that I can tell you with great confidence,
p168
aVI've been to the future.
p169
aVI've been there, actually, many times.
p170
aVAnd the reason I say that is,
p171
aVhow many times in my life have I said,
p172
aV"Oh, in 10 years, this will happen,"
p173
aVand then 10 years comes.
p174
aVAnd then you say, "Oh, in five years, this will happen."
p175
aVAnd then five years comes.
p176
aVSo I say this a little bit with having felt
p177
aVthat I'd been there a number of times,
p178
aVand one of the things that is most quoted
p179
aVthat I've ever said
p180
aVis that computing is not about computers,
p181
aVand that didn't quite get enough traction,
p182
aVand then it started to.
p183
aVIt started to because people caught on
p184
aVthat the medium wasn't the message.
p185
aVAnd the reason I show this car
p186
aVin actually a rather ugly slide
p187
aVis just again to tell you the kind of story
p188
aVthat characterized a little bit of my life.
p189
aVThis is a student of mine
p190
aVwho had done a Ph.D. called "Backseat Driver."
p191
aVIt was in the early days of GPS,
p192
aVthe car knew where it was,
p193
aVand it would give audio instructions
p194
aVto the driver, when to turn right,  when to turn left and so on.
p195
aVTurns out, there are a lot of things
p196
aVin those instructions that back in that period
p197
aVwere pretty challenging,
p198
aVlike what does it mean, take the next right?
p199
aVWell, if you're coming up on a street,
p200
aVthe next right's probably the one after,
p201
aVand there are lots of issues,
p202
aVand the student did a wonderful thesis,
p203
aVand the MIT patent office said "Don't patent it.
p204
aVIt'll never be accepted.
p205
aVThe liabilities are too large.
p206
aVThere will be insurance issues.
p207
aVDon't patent it."
p208
aVSo we didn't,
p209
aVbut it shows you how people, again, at times,
p210
aVdon't really look at what's happening.
p211
aa(lp212
VSome work, and I'll just go through these very quickly,
p213
aVa lot of sensory stuff.
p214
aVYou might recognize a young Yo-Yo Ma
p215
aVand tracking his body for playing
p216
aVthe cello or the hypercello.
p217
aVThese fellows literally walked  around like that at the time.
p218
aVIt's now a little bit more discreet
p219
aVand more commonplace.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd then there are at least three heroes
p222
aVI want to quickly mention.
p223
aVMarvin Minsky, who taught me a lot
p224
aVabout common sense,
p225
aVand I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper,
p226
aVwho was very important to Ricky Wurman
p227
aVand to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage,
p228
aVshe said, the first thing she said was,
p229
aV"I introduced Ricky to Nicky."
p230
aVAnd nobody calls me Nicky
p231
aVand nobody calls Richard Ricky,
p232
aVso nobody knew who she was talking about.
p233
aVAnd then, of course, Seymour Papert,
p234
aVwho is the person who said,
p235
aV"You can't think about thinking
p236
aVunless you think about thinking about something."
p237
aVAnd that's actually \u2014 you can unpack that later.
p238
aVIt's a pretty profound statement.
p239
aa(lp240
VI'm showing some slides
p241
aVthat were from TED 2,
p242
aVa little silly as slides, perhaps.
p243
aVThen I felt television really was about displays.
p244
aVAgain, now we're past TED 1,
p245
aVbut just around the time of TED 2,
p246
aVand what I'd like to mention here is,
p247
aVeven though you could imagine
p248
aVintelligence in the device,
p249
aVI look today at some of the work
p250
aVbeing done about the Internet of Things,
p251
aVand I think it's kind of tragically pathetic,
p252
aVbecause what has happened is people take
p253
aVthe oven panel and put it on your cell phone,
p254
aVor the door key onto your cell phone,
p255
aVjust taking it and bringing it to you,
p256
aVand in fact that's actually what you don't want.
p257
aVYou want to put a chicken in the oven,
p258
aVand the oven says, "Aha, it's a chicken,"
p259
aVand it cooks the chicken.
p260
aV"Oh, it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas,
p261
aVand he likes it this way and that way."
p262
aVSo the intelligence, instead of being in the device,
p263
aVwe have started today
p264
aVto move it back onto the cell phone
p265
aVor closer to the user,
p266
aVnot a particularly enlightened view
p267
aVof the Internet of Things.
p268
aVTelevision, again, television what I said today,
p269
aVthat was back in 1990,
p270
aVand the television of tomorrow
p271
aVwould look something like that.
p272
aVAgain, people, but they laughed cynically,
p273
aVthey didn't laugh with much appreciation.
p274
aa(lp275
VTelecommunications in the 1990s,
p276
aVGeorge Gilder decided that he would call this diagram
p277
aVthe Negroponte switch.
p278
aVI'm probably much less famous than George,
p279
aVso when he called it the Negroponte switch, it stuck,
p280
aVbut the idea of things that came in the ground
p281
aVwould go in the air and stuff in the air
p282
aVwould go into the ground
p283
aVhas played itself out.
p284
aVThat is the original slide from that year,
p285
aVand it has worked in lockstep obedience.
p286
aa(lp287
VWe started Wired magazine.
p288
aVSome people, I remember we shared
p289
aVthe reception desk periodically,
p290
aVand some parent called up irate that his son
p291
aVhad given up Sports Illustrated
p292
aVto subscribe for Wired,
p293
aVand he said, "Are you some porno magazine or something?"
p294
aVand couldn't understand why his son
p295
aVwould be interested in Wired, at any rate.
p296
aa(lp297
VI will go through this a little quicker.
p298
aVThis is my favorite, 1995,
p299
aVback page of Newsweek magazine.
p300
aVOkay. Read it. (Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
V["Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure." \u2014Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995]
p303
aa(lp304
VYou must admit that gives you,
p305
aVat least it gives me pleasure
p306
aVwhen somebody says how dead wrong you are.
p307
aa(lp308
V"Being Digital" came out.
p309
aVFor me, it gave me an opportunity
p310
aVto be more in the trade press
p311
aVand get this out to the public,
p312
aVand it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab,
p313
aVwhich if you haven't been to, visit,
p314
aVbecause it's a beautiful piece of architecture
p315
aVaside from being a wonderful place to work.
p316
aVSo these are the things we were saying in those TEDs.
p317
aa(lp318
V[Today, multimedia is a desktop or living room experience, because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small, bright, thin, high-resolution displays. \u2014 1995]
p319
aa(lp320
VWe came to them.
p321
aVI looked forward to it every year.
p322
aVIt was the party that Ricky Wurman never had
p323
aVin the sense that he invited many of his old friends,
p324
aVincluding myself.
p325
aa(lp326
VAnd then something for me changed
p327
aVpretty profoundly.
p328
aVI became more involved with computers and learning
p329
aVand influenced by Seymour,
p330
aVbut particularly looking at learning
p331
aVas something that is best approximated
p332
aVby computer programming.
p333
aVWhen you write a computer program,
p334
aVyou've got to not just list things out
p335
aVand sort of take an algorithm
p336
aVand translate it into a set of instructions,
p337
aVbut when there's a bug, and all programs have bugs,
p338
aVyou've got to de-bug it.
p339
aVYou've got to go in, change it,
p340
aVand then re-execute,
p341
aVand you iterate,
p342
aVand that iteration is really
p343
aVa very, very good approximation of learning.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo that led to my own work with Seymour
p346
aVin places like Cambodia
p347
aVand the starting of One Laptop per Child.
p348
aVEnough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child,
p349
aVso I'll go through it very fast,
p350
aVbut it did give us the chance
p351
aVto do something at a relatively large scale
p352
aVin the area of learning, development and computing.
p353
aVVery few people know that One Laptop per Child
p354
aVwas a $1 billion project,
p355
aVand it was, at least over the seven years I ran it,
p356
aVbut even more important, the World Bank
p357
aVcontributed zero, USAID zero.
p358
aVIt was mostly the countries using their own treasuries,
p359
aVwhich is very interesting,
p360
aVat least to me it was very interesting
p361
aVin terms of what I plan to do next.
p362
aVSo these are the various places it happened.
p363
aa(lp364
VI then tried an experiment,
p365
aVand the experiment happened in Ethiopia.
p366
aVAnd here's the experiment.
p367
aVThe experiment is,
p368
aVcan learning happen where there are no schools.
p369
aVAnd we dropped off tablets
p370
aVwith no instructions
p371
aVand let the children figure it out.
p372
aVAnd in a short period of time,
p373
aVthey not only
p374
aVturned them on and were using 50 apps per child
p375
aVwithin five days,
p376
aVthey were singing "ABC" songs within two weeks,
p377
aVbut they hacked Android within six months.
p378
aVAnd so that seemed sufficiently interesting.
p379
aVThis is perhaps the best picture I have.
p380
aVThe kid on your right
p381
aVhas sort of nominated himself as teacher.
p382
aVLook at the kid on the left, and so on.
p383
aVThere are no adults involved in this at all.
p384
aVSo I said, well can we do this
p385
aVat a larger scale?
p386
aVAnd what is it that's missing?
p387
aVThe kids are giving a press conference at this point,
p388
aVand sort of writing in the dirt.
p389
aVAnd the answer is, what is missing?
p390
aVAnd I'm going to skip over my prediction, actually,
p391
aVbecause I'm running out of time,
p392
aVand here's the question, is what's going to happen?
p393
aa(lp394
VI think the challenge
p395
aVis to connect the last billion people,
p396
aVand connecting the last billion
p397
aVis very different than connecting the next billion,
p398
aVand the reason it's different
p399
aVis that the next billion
p400
aVare sort of low-hanging fruit,
p401
aVbut the last billion are rural.
p402
aVBeing rural and being poor
p403
aVare very different.
p404
aVPoverty tends to be created by our society,
p405
aVand the people in that community are not poor
p406
aVin the same way at all.
p407
aVThey may be primitive,
p408
aVbut the way to approach it and to connect them,
p409
aVthe history of One Laptop per Child,
p410
aVand the experiment in Ethiopia,
p411
aVlead me to believe that we can in fact
p412
aVdo this in a very short period of time.
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd so my plan,
p415
aVand unfortunately I haven't been able
p416
aVto get my partners at this point
p417
aVto let me announce them,
p418
aVbut is to do this with a stationary satellite.
p419
aVThere are many reasons
p420
aVthat stationary satellites aren't the best things,
p421
aVbut there are a lot of reasons why they are,
p422
aVand for two billion dollars,
p423
aVyou can connect a lot more than 100 million people,
p424
aVbut the reason I picked two,
p425
aVand I will leave this as my last slide,
p426
aVis two billion dollars
p427
aVis what we were spending
p428
aVin Afghanistan
p429
aVevery week.
p430
aVSo surely if we can connect
p431
aVAfrica and the last billion people
p432
aVfor numbers like that,
p433
aVwe should be doing it.
p434
aa(lp435
VThank you very much.
p436
aa(lp437
V(Applause)
p438
aa(lp439
VChris Anderson: Stay up there. Stay up there.
p440
aa(lp441
VNN: You're going to give me extra time?
p442
aa(lp443
VCA: No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever.
p444
aVYou gamed it beautifully.
p445
aVNicholas, what is your prediction?
p446
aV(Laughter)
p447
aa(lp448
VNN: Thank you for asking.
p449
aVI'll tell you what my prediction is,
p450
aVand my prediction, and this is a prediction,
p451
aVbecause it'll be 30 years. I won't be here.
p452
aVBut one of the things about learning how to read,
p453
aVwe have been doing a lot of consuming
p454
aVof information going through our eyes,
p455
aVand so that may be a very inefficient channel.
p456
aVSo my prediction is that we are  going to ingest information
p457
aVYou're going to swallow a pill and know English.
p458
aVYou're going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare.
p459
aVAnd the way to do it is through the bloodstream.
p460
aVSo once it's in your bloodstream,
p461
aVit basically goes through it and gets into the brain,
p462
aVand when it knows that it's in the brain
p463
aVin the different pieces,
p464
aVit deposits it in the right places.
p465
aVSo it's ingesting.
p466
aa(lp467
VCA: Have you been hanging out with Ray Kurzweil by any chance?
p468
aa(lp469
VNN: No, but I've been hanging around with Ed Boyden
p470
aVand hanging around with one of the speakers
p471
aVwho is here, Hugh Herr,
p472
aVand there are a number of people.
p473
aVThis isn't quite as far-fetched,
p474
aVso 30 years from now.
p475
aa(lp476
VCA: We will check it out.
p477
aVWe're going to be back and we're going to play this clip 30 years from now,
p478
aVand then all eat the red pill.
p479
aa(lp480
VWell thank you for that.
p481
aa(lp482
VNicholas Negroponte.
p483

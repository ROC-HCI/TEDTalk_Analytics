VWorldwide, over 1.5 billion people experience armed conflict.
p5
aVIn response, people are forced to flee their country,
p6
aVleaving over 15 million refugees.
p7
aVChildren, without a doubt,
p8
aVare the most innocent and vulnerable victims ...
p9
aVbut not just from the obvious physical dangers,
p10
aVbut from the often unspoken effects that wars have on their families.
p11
aVThe experiences of war leave children at a real high risk
p12
aVfor the development of emotional and behavioral problems.
p13
aVChildren, as we can only imagine,
p14
aVwill feel worried, threatened and at risk.
p15
aVBut there is good news.
p16
aVThe quality of care that children receive in their families
p17
aVcan have a more significant effect on their well-being
p18
aVthan from the actual experiences of war that they have been exposed to.
p19
aVSo actually, children can be protected
p20
aVby warm, secure parenting during and after conflict.
p21
aa(lp22
VIn 2011, I was a first-year PhD student
p23
aVin the University of Manchester School of Psychological Sciences.
p24
aVLike many of you here,
p25
aVI watched the crisis in Syria unfold in front of me on the TV.
p26
aVMy family is originally from Syria,
p27
aVand very early on,
p28
aVI lost several family members in really horrifying ways.
p29
aVI'd sit and I'd gather with my family and watch the TV.
p30
aVWe've all seen those scenes:
p31
aVbombs destroying buildings,
p32
aVchaos, destruction
p33
aVand people screaming and running.
p34
aVIt was always the people screaming and running that really got me the most,
p35
aVespecially those terrified-looking children.
p36
aVI was a mother to two young, typically inquisitive children.
p37
aVThey were five and six then,
p38
aVat an age where they typically asked lots and lots of questions,
p39
aVand expected real, convincing answers.
p40
aVSo, I began to wonder what it might be like
p41
aVto parent my children in a war zone and a refugee camp.
p42
aVWould my children change?
p43
aVWould my daughter's bright, happy eyes lose their shine?
p44
aVWould my son's really relaxed and carefree nature become fearful and withdrawn?
p45
aVHow would I cope?
p46
aVWould I change?
p47
aa(lp48
VAs psychologists and parent trainers,
p49
aVwe know that arming parents with skills in caring for their children
p50
aVcan have a huge effect on their well-being,
p51
aVand we call this parent training.
p52
aVThe question I had was,
p53
aVcould parent training programs be useful for families
p54
aVwhile they were still in war zones or refugee camps?
p55
aVCould we reach them with advice or training
p56
aVthat would help them through these struggles?
p57
aVSo I approached my PhD supervisor,
p58
aVProfessor Rachel Calam,
p59
aVwith the idea of using my academic skills to make some change in the real world.
p60
aVI wasn't quite sure what exactly I wanted to do.
p61
aVShe listened carefully and patiently,
p62
aVand then to my joy she said,
p63
aV"If that's what you want to do, and it means so much to you,
p64
aVthen let's do it.
p65
aVLet's find ways to see if parent programs
p66
aVcan be useful for families in these contexts."
p67
aa(lp68
VSo for the past five years, myself and my colleagues \u2014
p69
aVProf. Calam and Dr. Kim Cartwright \u2014
p70
aVhave been working on ways to support families
p71
aVthat have experienced war and displacement.
p72
aVNow, to know how to help families that have been through conflict
p73
aVsupport their children,
p74
aVthe first step must obviously be to ask them what they're struggling with,
p75
aVright?
p76
aVI mean, it seems obvious.
p77
aVBut it's often those that are the most vulnerable,
p78
aVthat we're trying to support,
p79
aVthat we actually don't ask.
p80
aVHow many times have we just assumed we know exactly the right thing
p81
aVthat's going to help someone or something without actually asking them first?
p82
aa(lp83
VSo I travelled to refugee camps in Syria and in Turkey,
p84
aVand I sat with families, and I listened.
p85
aVI listened to their parenting challenges,
p86
aVI listened to their parenting struggles
p87
aVand I listened to their call for help.
p88
aVAnd sometimes that was just paused,
p89
aVas all I could do was hold hands with them
p90
aVand just join them in silent crying and prayer.
p91
aVThey told me about their struggles,
p92
aVthey told me about the rough, harsh refugee camp conditions
p93
aVthat made it hard to focus on anything but practical chores
p94
aVlike collecting clean water.
p95
aVThey told me how they watched their children withdraw;
p96
aVthe sadness, depression, anger,
p97
aVbed-wetting, thumb-sucking, fear of loud noises,
p98
aVfear of nightmares \u2014
p99
aVterrifying, terrifying nightmares.
p100
aVThese families had been through what we had been watching on the TV.
p101
aVThe mothers \u2014
p102
aValmost half of them were now widows of war,
p103
aVor didn't even know if their husbands were dead or alive \u2014
p104
aVdescribed how they felt they were coping so badly.
p105
aVThey watched their children change and they had no idea how to help them.
p106
aVThey didn't know how to answer their children's questions.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhat I found incredibly astonishing and so motivational
p109
aVwas that these families were so motivated to support their children.
p110
aVDespite all these challenges they faced,
p111
aVthey were trying to help their children.
p112
aVThey were making attempts at seeking support from NGO workers,
p113
aVfrom refugee camp teachers,
p114
aVprofessional medics,
p115
aVother parents.
p116
aVOne mother I met had only been in a camp for four days,
p117
aVand had already made two attempts
p118
aVat seeking support for her eight-year-old daughter
p119
aVwho was having terrifying nightmares.
p120
aVBut sadly, these attempts are almost always useless.
p121
aVRefugee camp doctors, when available,
p122
aVare almost always too busy,
p123
aVor don't have the knowledge or the time for basic parenting supports.
p124
aVRefugee camp teachers and other parents are just like them \u2014
p125
aVpart of a new refugee community who's struggling with new needs.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo then we began to think.
p128
aVHow could we help these families?
p129
aVThe families were struggling with things much bigger than they could cope with.
p130
aVThe Syrian crisis made it clear
p131
aVhow incredibly impossible it would be to reach families on an individual level.
p132
aVHow else could we help them?
p133
aVHow would we reach families at a population level
p134
aVand low costs
p135
aVin these terrifying, terrifying times?
p136
aa(lp137
VAfter hours of speaking to NGO workers,
p138
aVone suggested a fantastic innovative idea
p139
aVof distributing parenting information leaflets via bread wrappers \u2014
p140
aVbread wrappers that were being delivered to families in a conflict zone in Syria
p141
aVby humanitarian workers.
p142
aVSo that's what we did.
p143
aVThe bread wrappers haven't changed at all in their appearance,
p144
aVexcept for the addition of two pieces of paper.
p145
aVOne was a parenting information leaflet that had basic advice and information
p146
aVthat normalized to the parent what they might be experiencing,
p147
aVand what their child might be experiencing.
p148
aVAnd information on how they could support themselves and their children,
p149
aVsuch as information like spending time talking to your child,
p150
aVshowing them more affection,
p151
aVbeing more patient with your child,
p152
aVtalking to your children.
p153
aVThe other piece of paper was a feedback questionnaire,
p154
aVand of course, there was a pen.
p155
aVSo is this simply leaflet distribution,
p156
aVor is this actually a possible means of delivering psychological first aid
p157
aVthat provides warm, secure, loving parenting?
p158
aa(lp159
VWe managed to distribute 3,000 of these in just one week.
p160
aVWhat was incredible was we had a 60 percent response rate.
p161
aV60 percent of the 3,000 families responded.
p162
aVI don't know how many researchers we have here today,
p163
aVbut that kind of response rate is fantastic.
p164
aVTo have that in Manchester would be a huge achievement,
p165
aVlet alone in a conflict zone in Syria \u2014
p166
aVreally highlighting how important these kinds of messages were to families.
p167
aVI remember how excited and eager we were for the return of the questionnaires.
p168
aVThe families had left hundreds of messages \u2014
p169
aVmost incredibly positive and encouraging.
p170
aVBut my favorite has got to be,
p171
aV"Thank you for not forgetting about us and our children."
p172
aVThis really illustrates the potential means
p173
aVof the delivery of psychological first aid to families,
p174
aVand the return of feedback, too.
p175
aVJust imagine replicating this using other means
p176
aVsuch as baby milk distribution, or female hygiene kits,
p177
aVor even food baskets.
p178
aa(lp179
VBut let's bring this closer to home,
p180
aVbecause the refugee crisis
p181
aVis one that is having an effect on every single one of us.
p182
aVWe're bombarded with images daily of statistics and of photos,
p183
aVand that's not surprising,
p184
aVbecause by last month,
p185
aVover one million refugees had reached Europe.
p186
aVOne million.
p187
aVRefugees are joining our communities,
p188
aVthey're becoming our neighbors,
p189
aVtheir children are attending our children's schools.
p190
aVSo we've adapted the leaflet to meet the needs of European refugees,
p191
aVand we have them online, open-access,
p192
aVin areas with a really high refugee influx.
p193
aVFor example, the Swedish healthcare uploaded it onto their website,
p194
aVand within the first 45 minutes,
p195
aVit was downloaded 343 times \u2014
p196
aVreally highlighting how important it is
p197
aVfor volunteers, practitioners and other parents
p198
aVto have open-access, psychological first-aid messages.
p199
aa(lp200
VIn 2013, I was sitting on the cold, hard floor of a refugee camp tent
p201
aVwith mothers sitting around me as I was conducting a focus group.
p202
aVAcross from me stood an elderly lady
p203
aVwith what seemed to be a 13-year-old girl lying beside her,
p204
aVwith her head on the elderly lady's knees.
p205
aVThe girl stayed quiet throughout the focus group,
p206
aVnot talking at all,
p207
aVwith her knees curled up against her chest.
p208
aVTowards the end of the focus group,
p209
aVand as I was thanking the mothers for their time,
p210
aVthe elderly lady looked at me while pointing at the young girl,
p211
aVand said to me, "Can you help us with...?"
p212
aVNot quite sure what she expected me to do,
p213
aVI looked at the young girl and smiled,
p214
aVand in Arabic I said,
p215
aV"Salaam alaikum. Shu-ismak?"
p216
aV"What's your name?"
p217
aVShe looked at me really confused and unengaged,
p218
aVbut then said, "Halul."
p219
aVHalul is the pet's name for the Arabic female name, Hala,
p220
aVand is only really used to refer to really young girls.
p221
aVAt that point I realized that actually Hala was probably much older than 13.
p222
aVIt turns out Hala was a 25-year-old mother to three young children.
p223
aVHala had been a confident, bright, bubbly, loving, caring mother
p224
aVto her children,
p225
aVbut the war had changed all of that.
p226
aVShe had lived through bombs being dropped in her town;
p227
aVshe had lived through explosions.
p228
aVWhen fighter jets were flying around their building,
p229
aVdropping bombs,
p230
aVher children would be screaming, terrified from the noise.
p231
aVHala would frantically grab pillows and cover her children's ears
p232
aVto block out the noise,
p233
aVall the while screaming herself.
p234
aVWhen they reached the refugee camp
p235
aVand she knew they were finally in some kind of safety,
p236
aVshe completely withdrew to acting like her old childhood self.
p237
aVShe completely rejected her family \u2014
p238
aVher children, her husband.
p239
aVHala simply could no longer cope.
p240
aa(lp241
VThis is a parenting struggle with a really tough ending,
p242
aVbut sadly, it's not uncommon.
p243
aVThose who experience armed conflict and displacement
p244
aVwill face serious emotional struggles.
p245
aVAnd that's something we can all relate to.
p246
aVIf you have been through a devastating time in your life,
p247
aVif you have lost someone or something you really care about,
p248
aVhow would you continue to cope?
p249
aVCould you still be able to care for yourself and for your family?
p250
aa(lp251
VGiven that the first years of a child's life are crucial
p252
aVfor healthy physical and emotional development,
p253
aVand that 1.5 billion people are experiencing armed conflict \u2014
p254
aVmany of whom are now joining our communities \u2014
p255
aVwe cannot afford to turn a blind eye
p256
aVto the needs of those who are experiencing war and displacement.
p257
aVWe must prioritize these families' needs \u2014
p258
aVboth those who are internally displaced, and those who are refugees worldwide.
p259
aVThese needs must be prioritized by NGO workers, policy makers,
p260
aVthe WHO, the UNHCR and every single one of us
p261
aVin whatever capacity it is that we function in our society.
p262
aa(lp263
VWhen we begin to recognize the individual faces of the conflict,
p264
aVwhen we begin to notice those intricate emotions on their faces,
p265
aVwe begin to see them as humans, too.
p266
aVWe begin to see the needs of these families,
p267
aVand these are the real human needs.
p268
aVWhen these family needs are prioritized,
p269
aVinterventions for children in humanitarian settings
p270
aVwill prioritize and recognize the primary role of the family in supporting children.
p271
aVFamily mental health will be shouting loud and clear
p272
aVin global, international agenda.
p273
aVAnd children will be less likely to enter social service systems
p274
aVin resettlement countries
p275
aVbecause their families would have had support earlier on.
p276
aVAnd we will be more open-minded,
p277
aVmore welcoming, more caring
p278
aVand more trusting to those who are joining our communities.
p279
aa(lp280
VWe need to stop wars.
p281
aVWe need to build a world where children can dream of planes dropping gifts,
p282
aVand not bombs.
p283
aVUntil we stop armed conflicts raging throughout the world,
p284
aVfamilies will continue to be displaced,
p285
aVleaving children vulnerable.
p286
aVBut by improving parenting and caregiver support,
p287
aVit may be possible to weaken the links between war and psychological difficulties
p288
aVin children and their families.
p289
aa(lp290
VThank you.

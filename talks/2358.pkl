VEvery day, I listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives,
p5
aVacross dangerous borders and unfriendly seas.
p6
aVBut there's one story that keeps me awake at night,
p7
aVand it's about Doaa.
p8
aa(lp9
VA Syrian refugee, 19 years old,
p10
aVshe was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages.
p11
aVHer dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria
p12
aVthat had been blown to pieces by a bomb.
p13
aVAnd the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year.
p14
aVAnd the community that once welcomed them there
p15
aVhad become weary of them.
p16
aVAnd one day, men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her.
p17
aVOnce an aspiring student thinking only of her future,
p18
aVnow she was scared all the time.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut she was also full of hope,
p21
aVbecause she was in love with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.
p22
aVBassem was also struggling in Egypt, and he said to Doaa,
p23
aV"Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.
p24
aVI will work, you can study \u2014 the promise of a new life."
p25
aVAnd he asked her father for her hand in marriage.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut they knew to get to Europe they had to risk their lives,
p28
aVtraveling across the Mediterranean Sea,
p29
aVputting their hands in smugglers', notorious for their cruelty.
p30
aVAnd Doaa was terrified of the water.
p31
aVShe always had been. She never learned to swim.
p32
aa(lp33
VIt was August that year, and already 2,000 people had died
p34
aVtrying to cross the Mediterranean,
p35
aVbut Doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to Northern Europe,
p36
aVand she thought, "Maybe we can, too."
p37
aVSo she asked her parents if they could go,
p38
aVand after a painful discussion, they consented,
p39
aVand Bassem paid his entire life savings \u2014 2,500 dollars each \u2014
p40
aVto the smugglers.
p41
aa(lp42
VIt was a Saturday morning when the call came,
p43
aVand they were taken by bus to a beach, hundreds of people on the beach.
p44
aVThey were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat,
p45
aV500 of them crammed onto that boat,
p46
aV300 below, [200] above.
p47
aVThere were Syrians, Palestinians, Africans, Muslims and Christians,
p48
aV100 children, including Sandra \u2014 little Sandra, six years old \u2014
p49
aVand Masa, 18 months.
p50
aVThere were families on that boat, crammed together shoulder to shoulder,
p51
aVfeet to feet.
p52
aVDoaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest,
p53
aVBassem holding her hand.
p54
aa(lp55
VDay two on the water, they were sick with worry
p56
aVand sick to their stomachs from the rough sea.
p57
aa(lp58
VDay three, Doaa had a premonition.
p59
aVAnd she said to Bassem, "I fear we're not going to make it.
p60
aVI fear the boat is going to sink."
p61
aVAnd Bassem said to her, "Please be patient.
p62
aVWe will make it to Sweden, we will get married
p63
aVand we will have a future."
p64
aa(lp65
VDay four, the passengers were getting agitated.
p66
aVThey asked the captain, "When will we get there?"
p67
aVHe told them to shut up, and he insulted them.
p68
aVHe said, "In 16 hours we will reach the shores of Italy."
p69
aVThey were weak and weary.
p70
aVSoon they saw a boat approach \u2014 a smaller boat, 10 men on board,
p71
aVwho started shouting at them, hurling insults,
p72
aVthrowing sticks, asking them to all disembark
p73
aVand get on this smaller, more unseaworthy boat.
p74
aVThe parents were terrified for their children,
p75
aVand they collectively refused to disembark.
p76
aVSo the boat sped away in anger,
p77
aVand a half an hour later, came back
p78
aVand started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat,
p79
aVjust below where she and Bassem were sitting.
p80
aVAnd she heard how they yelled,
p81
aV"Let the fish eat your flesh!"
p82
aVAnd they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank.
p83
aa(lp84
VThe 300 people below deck were doomed.
p85
aVDoaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank,
p86
aVand watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller.
p87
aVBassem said to her, "Please let go,
p88
aVor you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you, too."
p89
aVAnd remember \u2014 she can't swim.
p90
aVBut she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs,
p91
aVthinking, "This is swimming."
p92
aVAnd miraculously, Bassem found a life ring.
p93
aVIt was one of those child's rings
p94
aVthat they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas.
p95
aVAnd Doaa climbed onto the ring,
p96
aVher arms and her legs dangling by the side.
p97
aVBassem was a good swimmer,
p98
aVso he held her hand and tread water.
p99
aVAround them there were corpses.
p100
aVAround 100 people survived initially,
p101
aVand they started coming together in groups, praying for rescue.
p102
aVBut when a day went by and no one came,
p103
aVsome people gave up hope,
p104
aVand Doaa and Bassem watched
p105
aVas men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water.
p106
aa(lp107
VOne man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder,
p108
aVnine months old \u2014 Malek.
p109
aVHe was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat, and he said to them,
p110
aV"I fear I am not going to survive.
p111
aVI'm too weak. I don't have the courage anymore."
p112
aVAnd he handed little Malek over to Bassem and to Doaa,
p113
aVand they perched her onto the life ring.
p114
aVSo now they were three, Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd let me take a pause in this story right here
p117
aVand ask the question:
p118
aVwhy do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks?
p119
aVMillions of refugees are living in exile, in limbo.
p120
aVThey're living in countries [fleeing] from a war that has been raging
p121
aVfor four years.
p122
aVEven if they wanted to return, they can't.
p123
aVTheir homes, their businesses,
p124
aVtheir towns and their cities have been completely destroyed.
p125
aVThis is a UNESCO World Heritage City,
p126
aVHoms, in Syria.
p127
aVSo people continue to flee into neighboring countries,
p128
aVand we build refugee camps for them in the desert.
p129
aVHundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these,
p130
aVand thousands and thousands more, millions, live in towns and cities.
p131
aVAnd the communities,
p132
aVthe neighboring countries that once welcomed them
p133
aVwith open arms and hearts
p134
aVare overwhelmed.
p135
aVThere are simply not enough schools, water systems, sanitation.
p136
aVEven rich European countries could never handle such an influx
p137
aVwithout massive investment.
p138
aVThe Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders,
p139
aVbut over seven million people are on the run inside the country.
p140
aVThat means that over half the Syrian population
p141
aVhas been forced to flee.
p142
aVBack to those neighboring countries hosting so many.
p143
aVThey feel that the richer world has done too little to support them.
p144
aVAnd days have turned into months, months into years.
p145
aVA refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary.
p146
aa(lp147
VBack to Doaa and Bassem in the water.
p148
aVIt was their second day, and Bassem was getting very weak.
p149
aVAnd now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem,
p150
aV"My love, please hold on to hope, to our future. We will make it."
p151
aVAnd he said to her,
p152
aV"I'm sorry, my love, that I put you in this situation.
p153
aVI have never loved anyone as much as I love you."
p154
aVAnd he released himself into the water,
p155
aVand Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes.
p156
aa(lp157
VLater that day,
p158
aVa mother came up to Doaa with her small 18-month-old daughter, Masa.
p159
aVThis was the little girl I showed you in the picture earlier,
p160
aVwith the life vests.
p161
aVHer older sister Sandra had just drowned,
p162
aVand her mother knew she had to do everything in her power
p163
aVto save her daughter.
p164
aVAnd she said to Doaa, "Please take this child.
p165
aVLet her be part of you. I will not survive."
p166
aVAnd then she went away and drowned.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee who was terrified of the water,
p169
aVwho couldn't swim,
p170
aVfound herself in charge of two little baby kids.
p171
aVAnd they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated,
p172
aVand she tried her best to amuse them,
p173
aVto sing to them, to say words to them from the Quran.
p174
aVAround them, the bodies were bloating and turning black.
p175
aVThe sun was blazing during the day.
p176
aVAt night, there was a cold moon and fog.
p177
aVIt was very frightening.
p178
aVOn the fourth day in the water, this is how Doaa probably looked
p179
aVon the ring with her two children.
p180
aa(lp181
VA woman came on the fourth day and approached her
p182
aVand asked her to take another child \u2014
p183
aVa little boy, just four years old.
p184
aVWhen Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned,
p185
aVshe said to the sobbing child,
p186
aV"She just went away to find you water and food."
p187
aVBut his heart soon stopped,
p188
aVand Doaa had to release the little boy into the water.
p189
aa(lp190
VLater that day,
p191
aVshe looked up into the sky with hope,
p192
aVbecause she saw two planes crossing in the sky.
p193
aVAnd she waved her arms, hoping they would see her,
p194
aVbut the planes were soon gone.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut that afternoon, as the sun was going down,
p197
aVshe saw a boat, a merchant vessel.
p198
aVAnd she said, "Please, God, let them rescue me."
p199
aVShe waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours.
p200
aVAnd it had become dark, but finally the searchlights found her
p201
aVand they extended a rope,
p202
aVastonished to see a woman clutching onto two babies.
p203
aa(lp204
VThey pulled them onto the boat, they got oxygen and blankets,
p205
aVand a Greek helicopter came to pick them up
p206
aVand take them to the island of Crete.
p207
aa(lp208
VBut Doaa looked down and asked, "What of Malek?"
p209
aVAnd they told her the little baby did not survive \u2014
p210
aVshe drew her last breath in the boat's clinic.
p211
aVBut Doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat,
p212
aVthat little baby girl had been smiling.
p213
aa(lp214
VOnly 11 people survived that wreck, of the 500.
p215
aVThere was never an international investigation into what happened.
p216
aVThere were some media reports about mass murder at sea,
p217
aVa terrible tragedy,
p218
aVbut that was only for one day.
p219
aVAnd then the news cycle moved on.
p220
aa(lp221
VMeanwhile, in a pediatric hospital on Crete,
p222
aVlittle Masa was on the edge of death.
p223
aVShe was really dehydrated. Her kidneys were failing.
p224
aVHer glucose levels were dangerously low.
p225
aVThe doctors did everything in their medical power to save them,
p226
aVand the Greek nurses never left her side,
p227
aVholding her, hugging her, singing her words.
p228
aVMy colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in Arabic.
p229
aVAmazingly, little Masa survived.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd soon the Greek press started reporting about the miracle baby,
p232
aVwho had survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink,
p233
aVand offers to adopt her came from all over the country.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd meanwhile, Doaa was in another hospital on Crete,
p236
aVthin, dehydrated.
p237
aVAn Egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released.
p238
aVAnd soon word went around about Doaa's survival,
p239
aVand a phone number was published on Facebook.
p240
aVMessages started coming in.
p241
aa(lp242
V"Doaa, do you know what happened to my brother?
p243
aVMy sister? My parents? My friends? Do you know if they survived?"
p244
aa(lp245
VOne of those messages said,
p246
aV"I believe you saved my little niece, Masa."
p247
aVAnd it had this photo.
p248
aVThis was from Masa's uncle,
p249
aVa Syrian refugee who had made it to Sweden with his family
p250
aVand also Masa's older sister.
p251
aVSoon, we hope, Masa will be reunited with him in Sweden,
p252
aVand until then, she's being cared for in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd Doaa? Well, word went around about her survival, too.
p255
aVAnd the media wrote about this slight woman,
p256
aVand couldn't imagine how she could survive all this time
p257
aVunder such conditions in that sea,
p258
aVand still save another life.
p259
aVThe Academy of Athens, one of Greece's most prestigious institutions,
p260
aVgave her an award of bravery,
p261
aVand she deserves all that praise,
p262
aVand she deserves a second chance.
p263
aVBut she wants to still go to Sweden.
p264
aVShe wants to reunite with her family there.
p265
aVShe wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings
p266
aVaway from Egypt there as well,
p267
aVand I believe she will succeed.
p268
aVShe wants to become a lawyer or a politician
p269
aVor something that can help fight injustice.
p270
aVShe is an extraordinary survivor.
p271
aa(lp272
VBut I have to ask:
p273
aVwhat if she didn't have to take that risk?
p274
aVWhy did she have to go through all that?
p275
aVWhy wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe?
p276
aVWhy couldn't Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden?
p277
aVWhy couldn't Bassem have found work?
p278
aVWhy is there no massive resettlement program for Syrian refugees,
p279
aVthe victims of the worst war of our times?
p280
aVThe world did this for the Vietnamese in the 1970s. Why not now?
p281
aVWhy is there so little investment in the neighboring countries
p282
aVhosting so many refugees?
p283
aVAnd why, the root question,
p284
aVis so little being done to stop the wars, the persecution
p285
aVand the poverty that is driving so many people
p286
aVto the shores of Europe?
p287
aVUntil these issues are resolved,
p288
aVpeople will continue to take to the seas
p289
aVand to seek safety and asylum.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd what happens next?
p292
aVWell, that is largely Europe's choice.
p293
aVAnd I understand the public fears.
p294
aVPeople are worried about their security, their economies, the changes of culture.
p295
aVBut is that more important than saving human lives?
p296
aVBecause there is something fundamental here
p297
aVthat I think overrides the rest,
p298
aVand it is about our common humanity.
p299
aVNo person fleeing war or persecution
p300
aVshould have to die crossing a sea to reach safety.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VOne thing is for sure,
p305
aVthat no refugee would be on those dangerous boats
p306
aVif they could thrive where they are.
p307
aVAnd no migrant would take that dangerous journey
p308
aVif they had enough food for themselves and their children.
p309
aVAnd no one would put their life savings
p310
aVin the hands of those notorious smugglers
p311
aVif there was a legal way to migrate.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo on behalf of little Masa
p314
aVand on behalf of Doaa
p315
aVand of Bassem
p316
aVand of those 500 people who drowned with them,
p317
aVcan we make sure that they did not die in vain?
p318
aVCould we be inspired by what happened,
p319
aVand take a stand for a world in which every life matters?
p320
aa(lp321
VThank you.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Applause)

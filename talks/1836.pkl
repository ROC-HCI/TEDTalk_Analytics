VHere's a question we need to rethink together:
p5
aVWhat should be the role of money
p6
aVand markets in our societies?
p7
aa(lp8
VToday, there are very few things
p9
aVthat money can't buy.
p10
aVIf you're sentenced to a jail term
p11
aVin Santa Barbara, California,
p12
aVyou should know
p13
aVthat if you don't like the standard accommodations,
p14
aVyou can buy a prison cell upgrade.
p15
aVIt's true. For how much, do you think?
p16
aVWhat would you guess?
p17
aVFive hundred dollars?
p18
aVIt's not the Ritz-Carlton. It's a jail!
p19
aVEighty-two dollars a night.
p20
aVEighty-two dollars a night.
p21
aVIf you go to an amusement park
p22
aVand don't want to stand in the long lines
p23
aVfor the popular rides,
p24
aVthere is now a solution.
p25
aVIn many theme parks, you can pay extra
p26
aVto jump to the head of the line.
p27
aVThey call them Fast Track or VIP tickets.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd this isn't only happening in amusement parks.
p30
aVIn Washington, D.C., long lines,
p31
aVqueues sometimes form
p32
aVfor important Congressional hearings.
p33
aVNow some people don't like to wait in long queues,
p34
aVmaybe overnight, even in the rain.
p35
aVSo now, for lobbyists and others
p36
aVwho are very keen to attend these hearings
p37
aVbut don't like to wait, there are companies,
p38
aVline-standing companies,
p39
aVand you can go to them.
p40
aVYou can pay them a certain amount of money,
p41
aVthey hire homeless people and others who need a job
p42
aVto stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes,
p43
aVand the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins,
p44
aVcan take his or her place at the head of the line
p45
aVand a seat in the front of the room.
p46
aVPaid line standing.
p47
aa(lp48
VIt's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms
p49
aVand market thinking and market solutions,
p50
aVin bigger arenas.
p51
aVTake the way we fight our wars.
p52
aVDid you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan,
p53
aVthere were more private military contractors on the ground
p54
aVthan there were U.S. military troops?
p55
aVNow this isn't because we had a public debate
p56
aVabout whether we wanted to outsource war
p57
aVto private companies,
p58
aVbut this is what has happened.
p59
aa(lp60
VOver the past three decades,
p61
aVwe have lived through a quiet revolution.
p62
aVWe've drifted almost without realizing it
p63
aVfrom having a market economy
p64
aVto becoming market societies.
p65
aVThe difference is this: A market economy is a tool,
p66
aVa valuable and effective tool,
p67
aVfor organizing productive activity,
p68
aVbut a market society is a place where
p69
aValmost everything is up for sale.
p70
aVIt's a way of life, in which market thinking
p71
aVand market values begin to dominate
p72
aVevery aspect of life:
p73
aVpersonal relations, family life, health, education,
p74
aVpolitics, law, civic life.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, why worry? Why worry about our becoming
p77
aVmarket societies?
p78
aVFor two reasons, I think.
p79
aVOne of them has to do with inequality.
p80
aVThe more things money can buy,
p81
aVthe more affluence, or the lack of it, matters.
p82
aVIf the only thing that money determined
p83
aVwas access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,
p84
aVthen inequality wouldn't matter very much.
p85
aVBut when money comes increasingly to govern
p86
aVaccess to the essentials of the good life \u2014
p87
aVdecent health care, access to the best education,
p88
aVpolitical voice and influence in campaigns \u2014
p89
aVwhen money comes to govern all of those things,
p90
aVinequality matters a great deal.
p91
aVAnd so the marketization of everything
p92
aVsharpens the sting of inequality
p93
aVand its social and civic consequence.
p94
aVThat's one reason to worry.
p95
aa(lp96
VThere's a second reason
p97
aVapart from the worry about inequality,
p98
aVand it's this:
p99
aVwith some social goods and practices,
p100
aVwhen market thinking and market values enter,
p101
aVthey may change the meaning of those practices
p102
aVand crowd out attitudes and norms
p103
aVworth caring about.
p104
aa(lp105
VI'd like to take an example
p106
aVof a controversial use of a market mechanism,
p107
aVa cash incentive, and see what you think about it.
p108
aVMany schools struggle with the challenge
p109
aVof motivating kids, especially kids
p110
aVfrom disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard,
p111
aVto do well in school, to apply themselves.
p112
aVSome economists have proposed a market solution:
p113
aVOffer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades
p114
aVor high test scores
p115
aVor for reading books.
p116
aVThey've tried this, actually.
p117
aVThey've done some experiments
p118
aVin some major American cities.
p119
aVIn New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.,
p120
aVthey've tried this, offering 50 dollars for an A,
p121
aV35 dollars for a B.
p122
aVIn Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers
p123
aVeight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo let's see what \u2014 Some people are in favor,
p126
aVsome people are opposed to this cash incentive
p127
aVto motivate achievement.
p128
aVLet's see what people here think about it.
p129
aVImagine that you are the head of a major school system,
p130
aVand someone comes to you with this proposal.
p131
aVAnd let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds.
p132
aVYou don't have to take it out of your budget.
p133
aVHow many would be in favor
p134
aVand how many would be opposed to giving it a try?
p135
aVLet's see by a show of hands.
p136
aa(lp137
VFirst, how many think it might at least be worth a try
p138
aVto see if it would work? Raise your hand.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd how many would be opposed? How many would \u2014
p141
aa(lp142
VSo the majority here are opposed,
p143
aVbut a sizable minority are in favor.
p144
aVLet's have a discussion.
p145
aVLet's start with those of you who object,
p146
aVwho would rule it out even before trying.
p147
aVWhat would be your reason?
p148
aVWho will get our discussion started? Yes?
p149
aa(lp150
VHeike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike,
p151
aVand I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation,
p152
aVso in the respect that children, if they would like to read,
p153
aVyou just take this incentive away
p154
aVin just paying them, so it just changes behavior.
p155
aVMichael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive away.
p156
aa(lp157
VWhat is, or should be, the intrinsic motivation?
p158
aa(lp159
VHM: Well, the intrinsic motivation
p160
aVshould be to learn.
p161
aa(lp162
VMS: To learn. HM: To get to know the world.
p163
aVAnd then, if you stop paying them, what happens then?
p164
aVThen they stop reading?
p165
aa(lp166
VMS: Now, let's see if there's someone who favors,
p167
aVwho thinks it's worth trying this.
p168
aa(lp169
VElizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus,
p170
aVand you said worth a try, so why not try it
p171
aVand do the experiment and measure things?
p172
aVMS: And measure. And what would you measure?
p173
aVYou'd measure how many \u2014
p174
aVEL: How many books they read
p175
aVand how many books they continued to read
p176
aVafter you stopped paying them.
p177
aa(lp178
VMS: Oh, after you stopped paying.
p179
aVAll right, what about that?
p180
aa(lp181
VHM: To be frank, I just think
p182
aVthis is, not to offend anyone, a very American way.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VMS: All right. What's emerged from this discussion
p187
aVis the following question:
p188
aVWill the cash incentive drive out or corrupt
p189
aVor crowd out the higher motivation,
p190
aVthe intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey,
p191
aVwhich is to learn to love to learn and to read
p192
aVfor their own sakes?
p193
aVAnd people disagree about what the effect will be,
p194
aVbut that seems to be the question,
p195
aVthat somehow a market mechanism
p196
aVor a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson,
p197
aVand if it does, what will become of these children later?
p198
aa(lp199
VI should tell you what's happened with these experiments.
p200
aVThe cash for good grades has had very mixed results,
p201
aVfor the most part has not resulted in higher grades.
p202
aVThe two dollars for each book
p203
aVdid lead those kids to read more books.
p204
aVIt also led them to read shorter books.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VBut the real question is,
p209
aVwhat will become of these kids later?
p210
aVWill they have learned that reading is a chore,
p211
aVa form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry,
p212
aVor may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially
p213
aVbut then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake?
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, what this, even this brief debate, brings out
p216
aVis something that many economists overlook.
p217
aVEconomists often assume
p218
aVthat markets are inert,
p219
aVthat they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.
p220
aVMarket exchange, they assume,
p221
aVdoesn't change the meaning or value
p222
aVof the goods being exchanged.
p223
aVThis may be true enough
p224
aVif we're talking about material goods.
p225
aVIf you sell me a flat screen television
p226
aVor give me one as a gift,
p227
aVit will be the same good.
p228
aVIt will work the same either way.
p229
aVBut the same may not be true
p230
aVif we're talking about nonmaterial goods
p231
aVand social practices such as teaching and learning
p232
aVor engaging together in civic life.
p233
aVIn those domains, bringing market mechanisms
p234
aVand cash incentives may undermine
p235
aVor crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes
p236
aVworth caring about.
p237
aVOnce we see
p238
aVthat markets and commerce,
p239
aVwhen extended beyond the material domain,
p240
aVcan change the character of the goods themselves,
p241
aVcan change the meaning of the social practices,
p242
aVas in the example of teaching and learning,
p243
aVwe have to ask where markets belong
p244
aVand where they don't,
p245
aVwhere they may actually undermine
p246
aVvalues and attitudes worth caring about.
p247
aVBut to have this debate,
p248
aVwe have to do something we're not very good at,
p249
aVand that is to reason together in public
p250
aVabout the value and the meaning
p251
aVof the social practices we prize,
p252
aVfrom our bodies to family life
p253
aVto personal relations to health
p254
aVto teaching and learning to civic life.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow these are controversial questions,
p257
aVand so we tend to shrink from them.
p258
aVIn fact, during the past three decades,
p259
aVwhen market reasoning and market thinking
p260
aVhave gathered force and gained prestige,
p261
aVour public discourse during this time
p262
aVhas become hollowed out,
p263
aVempty of larger moral meaning.
p264
aVFor fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.
p265
aVBut once we see that markets
p266
aVchange the character of goods,
p267
aVwe have to debate among ourselves
p268
aVthese bigger questions
p269
aVabout how to value goods.
p270
aa(lp271
VOne of the most corrosive effects
p272
aVof putting a price on everything
p273
aVis on commonality,
p274
aVthe sense that we are all in it together.
p275
aVAgainst the background of rising inequality,
p276
aVmarketizing every aspect of life
p277
aVleads to a condition where those who are affluent
p278
aVand those who are of modest means
p279
aVincreasingly live separate lives.
p280
aVWe live and work and shop and play
p281
aVin different places.
p282
aVOur children go to different schools.
p283
aa(lp284
VThis isn't good for democracy,
p285
aVnor is it a satisfying way to live,
p286
aVeven for those of us who can afford
p287
aVto buy our way to the head of the line.
p288
aVHere's why.
p289
aVDemocracy does not require perfect equality,
p290
aVbut what it does require
p291
aVis that citizens share in a common life.
p292
aVWhat matters is that people
p293
aVof different social backgrounds
p294
aVand different walks of life
p295
aVencounter one another,
p296
aVbump up against one another
p297
aVin the ordinary course of life,
p298
aVbecause this is what teaches us
p299
aVto negotiate and to abide our differences.
p300
aVAnd this is how we come to care for the common good.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd so, in the end, the question of markets
p303
aVis not mainly an economic question.
p304
aVIt's really a question of how we want to live together.
p305
aVDo we want a society where everything is up for sale,
p306
aVor are there certain moral and civic goods
p307
aVthat markets do not honor
p308
aVand money cannot buy?
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you very much.

The <em>London Observer </em>calls him &quot;one of the most popular teachers in the world&quot; and indeed his lectures at Harvard draw thousands of students eager to discuss big questions of modern political life: bioethics, torture, rights versus responsibilities, the value we put on things. Sandel&#39;s class is a primer on thinking through the hard choices we face as citizens. The course has been turned into a public TV series with companion website and book:&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/justicewhatsright\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Justice: What&rsquo;s the Right Thing to Do?</em></a>&nbsp;In his newest book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/whatmoneycantbuy\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>What Money Can&#39;t Buy</em></a><em>, </em>he challenges the idea that markets are morally neutral.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;To understand the importance of his purpose,&quot; a <em>Guardian</em> reviewer wrote of the book, &quot;you first have to grasp the full extent of the triumph achieved by market thinking in economics, and the extent to which that thinking has spread to other domains. This school sees economics as a discipline that has nothing to do with morality, and is instead the study of incentives, considered in an ethical vacuum. Sandel&#39;s book is, in its calm way, an all-out assault on that idea, and on the influential doctrine that the economic approach to &quot;utility maximisation&quot; explains all human behaviour.&quot;</p><p>Read more about his thinking on markets and morality: <a href=\\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/bd509112-9c55-11e2-9a4b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2PhLrm500\\" target=\\"_blank\\">&quot;Lunch with Michael Sandel&quot; on FT.com &gt;&gt;</a> &nbsp; </p>", "slug": "michael_sandel", "whotheyare": "Michael Sandel teaches political philosophy at Harvard, exploring some of the most hotly contested moral and political issues of our time.", "whatotherssay": "He sets himself at odds with one of the reigning assumptions of modern public life -- that moral and religious notions are private matters that should be kept out of public political debate.", "id": 594, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/137573_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Why we shouldn\'t trust markets with our civic life", "take_action": null, "comments": 22503, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/42188744195825bc26841b72a0b3d5c3f11457a6_1600x1200.jpg", "description": "In the past three decades, says Michael Sandel, the US has drifted from a market economy to a market society; it\'s fair to say that an American\'s experience of shared civic life depends on how much money they have.

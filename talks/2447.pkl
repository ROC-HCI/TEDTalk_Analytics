VI want to tell you the story
p5
aVabout the time I almost got kidnapped
p6
aVin the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.
p7
aVIt's the day after graduating from design school
p8
aVand I'm having a yard sale.
p9
aVAnd this guy pulls up in this red Mazda
p10
aVand he starts looking through my stuff.
p11
aVAnd he buys a piece of art that I made.
p12
aVAnd it turns out he's alone in town for the night,
p13
aVdriving cross-country on a road trip
p14
aVbefore he goes into the Peace Corps.
p15
aVSo I invite him out for a beer
p16
aVand he tells me all about his passion
p17
aVfor making a difference in the world.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow it's starting to get late,
p20
aVand I'm getting pretty tired.
p21
aVAs I motion for the tab,
p22
aVI make the mistake of asking him,
p23
aV"So where are you staying tonight?"
p24
aVAnd he makes it worse by saying,
p25
aV"Actually, I don't have a place."
p26
aVAnd I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"
p27
aVWhat do you do?
p28
aVWe've all been there, right?
p29
aVDo I offer to host this guy?
p30
aVBut, I just met him \u2014 I mean,
p31
aVhe says he's going to the Peace Corps,
p32
aVbut I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps
p33
aVand I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.
p34
aVThat's a small trunk!
p35
aa(lp36
VSo then I hear myself saying,
p37
aV"Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room."
p38
aVAnd the voice in my head goes,
p39
aV"Wait, what?"
p40
aa(lp41
VThat night, I'm laying in bed,
p42
aVI'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,
p43
aV"Oh my god, what have I done?
p44
aVThere's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.
p45
aVWhat if he's psychotic?"
p46
aVMy anxiety grows so much,
p47
aVI leap out of bed,
p48
aVI sneak on my tiptoes to the door,
p49
aVand I lock the bedroom door.
p50
aa(lp51
VIt turns out he was not psychotic.
p52
aVWe've kept in touch ever since.
p53
aVAnd the piece of art he bought at the yard sale
p54
aVis hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.
p55
aa(lp56
VThis was my first hosting experience,
p57
aVand it completely changed my perspective.
p58
aVMaybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers
p59
aVwere actually friends waiting to be discovered.
p60
aVThe idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me
p61
aVand when I moved to San Francisco,
p62
aVI brought the airbed with me.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo now it's two years later.
p65
aVI'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,
p66
aVmy roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up.
p67
aVAnd then I learn there's a design conference coming to town,
p68
aVand all the hotels are sold out.
p69
aVAnd I've always believed that turning fear into fun
p70
aVis the gift of creativity.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky:
p73
aV"Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks \u2014
p74
aVturning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,'
p75
aVoffering young designers who come to town a place to crash,
p76
aVcomplete with wireless Internet, a small desk space,
p77
aVsleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.
p78
aVHa!"
p79
aa(lp80
VWe built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born.
p81
aVThree lucky guests got to stay
p82
aVon a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor.
p83
aVBut they loved it, and so did we.
p84
aVI swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made
p85
aVtasted totally different because we made them for our guests.
p86
aVWe took them on adventures around the city,
p87
aVand when we said goodbye to the last guest,
p88
aVthe door latch clicked,
p89
aVBrian and I just stared at each other.
p90
aVDid we just discover it was possible to make friends
p91
aVwhile also making rent?
p92
aa(lp93
VThe wheels had started to turn.
p94
aVMy old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,
p95
aVjoined as engineering co-founder.
p96
aVAnd we buckled down to see
p97
aVif we could turn this into a business.
p98
aa(lp99
VHere's what we pitched investors:
p100
aV"We want to build a website
p101
aVwhere people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces,
p102
aVtheir bedrooms, the bathrooms \u2014
p103
aVthe kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over.
p104
aVAnd then, over the Internet,
p105
aVthey're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes.
p106
aVIt's going to be huge!"
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VWe sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off.
p111
aVIt did not.
p112
aVNo one in their right minds would invest in a service
p113
aVthat allows strangers to sleep in people's homes.
p114
aVWhy?
p115
aVBecause we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know,
p118
aVand all we really knew was design.
p119
aVIn art school, you learn that design is much more
p120
aVthan the look and feel of something \u2014 it's the whole experience.
p121
aVWe learned to do that for objects,
p122
aVbut here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust
p123
aVbetween people who had never met.
p124
aVCould design make that happen?
p125
aVIs it possible to design for trust?
p126
aa(lp127
VI want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust
p128
aVthat we were aiming to achieve.
p129
aVI've got a 30-second experiment
p130
aVthat will push you past your comfort zone.
p131
aVIf you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.
p132
aVOK, I need you to take out your phones.
p133
aVNow that you have your phone out,
p134
aVI'd like you to unlock your phone.
p135
aVNow hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VThat tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now \u2014
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
Vis exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.
p144
aVBecause the only thing more personal than your phone
p145
aVis your home.
p146
aVPeople don't just see your messages,
p147
aVthey see your bedroom,
p148
aVyour kitchen, your toilet.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone?
p151
aVMost of us feel really responsible.
p152
aVThat's how most guests feel when they stay in a home.
p153
aVAnd it's because of this that our company can even exist.
p154
aVBy the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VWould you tell Twitter he's running for President?
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
V(Applause)
p163
aa(lp164
VOK, you can hand your phones back now.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge
p167
aVwe were facing,
p168
aVI'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way.
p169
aVWhat if we changed one small thing
p170
aVabout the design of that experiment?
p171
aVWhat if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name,
p172
aVwhere they're from, the name of their kids or their dog?
p173
aVImagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying,
p174
aV"They're great at holding unlocked phones!"
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VNow how would you feel about handing your phone over?
p179
aa(lp180
VIt turns out,
p181
aVa well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.
p182
aVAnd we didn't actually get it right the first time.
p183
aVIt's hard for people to leave bad reviews.
p184
aVEventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts
p185
aVleft the review before we reveal them.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, here's a discovery we made just last week.
p188
aVWe did a joint study with Stanford,
p189
aVwhere we looked at people's willingness to trust someone
p190
aVbased on how similar they are in age, location and geography.
p191
aVThe research showed, not surprisingly,
p192
aVwe prefer people who are like us.
p193
aVThe more different somebody is,
p194
aVthe less we trust them.
p195
aVNow, that's a natural social bias.
p196
aVBut what's interesting is what happens
p197
aVwhen you add reputation into the mix,
p198
aVin this case, with reviews.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow, if you've got less than three reviews,
p201
aVnothing changes.
p202
aVBut if you've got more than 10,
p203
aVeverything changes.
p204
aVHigh reputation beats high similarity.
p205
aVThe right design can actually help us overcome
p206
aVone of our most deeply rooted biases.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow we also learned that building the right amount of trust
p209
aVtakes the right amount of disclosure.
p210
aVThis is what happens when a guest first messages a host.
p211
aVIf you share too little, like, "Yo,"
p212
aVacceptance rates go down.
p213
aVAnd if you share too much, like,
p214
aV"I'm having issues with my mother,"
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
Vacceptance rates also go down.
p219
aVBut there's a zone that's just right,
p220
aVlike, "Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family."
p221
aVSo how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?
p222
aVWe use the size of the box to suggest the right length,
p223
aVand we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing.
p224
aa(lp225
VWe bet our whole company
p226
aVon the hope that,
p227
aVwith the right design,
p228
aVpeople would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias.
p229
aVWhat we didn't realize
p230
aVis just how many people
p231
aVwere ready and waiting to put the bias aside.
p232
aa(lp233
VThis is a graph that shows our rate of adoption.
p234
aVThere's three things happening here.
p235
aVThe first, an unbelievable amount of luck.
p236
aVThe second is the efforts of our team.
p237
aVAnd third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need.
p238
aVNow, things have been going pretty well.
p239
aa(lp240
VObviously, there are times when things don't work out.
p241
aVGuests have thrown unauthorized parties
p242
aVand trashed homes.
p243
aVHosts have left guests stranded in the rain.
p244
aVIn the early days, I was customer service,
p245
aVand those calls came right to my cell phone.
p246
aVI was at the front lines of trust breaking.
p247
aVAnd there's nothing worse than those calls,
p248
aVit hurts to even think about them.
p249
aVAnd the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice
p250
aVwas and, I would say, still is
p251
aVour single greatest motivator to keep improving.
p252
aa(lp253
VThankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted,
p254
aVless than a fraction of a percent have been problematic.
p255
aVTurns out, people are justified in their trust.
p256
aVAnd when trust works out right,
p257
aVit can be absolutely magical.
p258
aa(lp259
VWe had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay,
p260
aVand he suffered a heart attack.
p261
aVThe host rushed him to the hospital.
p262
aVThey donated their own blood for his operation.
p263
aVLet me read you his review.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
V"Excellent house for sedentary travelers
p268
aVprone to myocardial infarctions.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VThe area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VJavier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels
p277
aVwho will save your life without even knowing you.
p278
aVThey will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying
p279
aVand stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass.
p280
aVThey don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read.
p281
aVAnd they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you.
p282
aVHighly recommended!"
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VOf course, not every stay is like that.
p287
aVBut this connection beyond the transaction
p288
aVis exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow, when I heard that term,
p291
aVI have to admit, it tripped me up.
p292
aVHow do sharing and transactions go together?
p293
aVSo let's be clear; it is about commerce.
p294
aVBut if you just called it the rental economy,
p295
aVit would be incomplete.
p296
aVThe sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection.
p297
aVPeople share a part of themselves,
p298
aVand that changes everything.
p299
aa(lp300
VYou know how most travel today is, like,
p301
aVI think of it like fast food \u2014
p302
aVit's efficient and consistent,
p303
aVat the cost of local and authentic.
p304
aVWhat if travel were like a magnificent buffet
p305
aVof local experiences?
p306
aVWhat if anywhere you visited,
p307
aVthere was a central marketplace of locals
p308
aVoffering to get you thoroughly drunk
p309
aVon a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed.
p310
aVOr learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant?
p311
aa(lp312
VToday, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation.
p313
aVWhat if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up?
p314
aVWhat would that look like?
p315
aVWhat if cities embraced a culture of sharing?
p316
aVI see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection
p317
aVinstead of isolation and separation.
p318
aa(lp319
VIn South Korea, in the city of Seoul,
p320
aVthey've actually even started this.
p321
aVThey've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots
p322
aVto be shared by residents.
p323
aVThey're connecting students who need a place to live
p324
aVwith empty-nesters who have extra rooms.
p325
aVAnd they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation
p326
aVof sharing economy start-ups.
p327
aa(lp328
VTonight, just on our service,
p329
aV785,000 people
p330
aVin 191 countries
p331
aVwill either stay in a stranger's home
p332
aVor welcome one into theirs.
p333
aVClearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught.
p334
aa(lp335
VWe didn't invent anything new.
p336
aVHospitality has been around forever.
p337
aVThere's been many other websites like ours.
p338
aVSo, why did ours eventually take off?
p339
aVLuck and timing aside,
p340
aVI've learned that you can take the components of trust,
p341
aVand you can design for that.
p342
aVDesign can overcome our most deeply rooted
p343
aVstranger-danger bias.
p344
aVAnd that's amazing to me.
p345
aVIt blows my mind.
p346
aVI think about this every time I see a red Miata go by.
p347
aa(lp348
VNow, we know design won't solve all the world's problems.
p349
aVBut if it can help out with this one,
p350
aVif it can make a dent in this,
p351
aVit makes me wonder, what else can we design for next?
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you.

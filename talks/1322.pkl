VWhat I'm going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines
p5
aVthat create the living fabric of your body.
p6
aVNow molecules are really, really tiny.
p7
aVAnd by tiny, I mean really.
p8
aVThey're smaller than a wavelength of light,
p9
aVso we have no way to directly observe them.
p10
aVBut through science, we do have a fairly good idea
p11
aVof what's going on down at the molecular scale.
p12
aVSo what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules,
p13
aVbut we don't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules.
p14
aa(lp15
VOne way around this is to draw pictures.
p16
aVAnd this idea is actually nothing new.
p17
aVScientists have always created pictures
p18
aVas part of their thinking and discovery process.
p19
aVThey draw pictures of what they're observing with their eyes,
p20
aVthrough technology like telescopes and microscopes,
p21
aVand also what they're thinking about in their minds.
p22
aVI picked two well-known examples,
p23
aVbecause they're very well-known for expressing science through art.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd I start with Galileo, who used the world's first telescope
p26
aVto look at the Moon.
p27
aVAnd he transformed our understanding of the Moon.
p28
aVThe perception in the 17th century
p29
aVwas the Moon was a perfect heavenly sphere.
p30
aVBut what Galileo saw was a rocky, barren world,
p31
aVwhich he expressed through his watercolor painting.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnother scientist with very big ideas,
p34
aVthe superstar of biology is Charles Darwin.
p35
aVAnd with this famous entry in his notebook,
p36
aVhe begins in the top left-hand corner with, "I think,"
p37
aVand then sketches out the first tree of life,
p38
aVwhich is his perception of how all the species,
p39
aVall living things on Earth are connected through evolutionary history \u2014
p40
aVthe origin of species through natural selection
p41
aVand divergence from an ancestral population.
p42
aa(lp43
VEven as a scientist,
p44
aVI used to go to lectures by molecular biologists
p45
aVand find them completely incomprehensible,
p46
aVwith all the fancy technical language and jargon
p47
aVthat they would use in describing their work,
p48
aVuntil I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell,
p49
aVwho is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute.
p50
aVAnd his pictures \u2014 everything's accurate and it's all to scale.
p51
aVAnd his work illuminated for me
p52
aVwhat the molecular world inside us is like.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo this is a transection through blood.
p55
aVIn the top left-hand corner, you've got this yellow-green area.
p56
aVThe yellow-green area is the fluid of blood, which is mostly water,
p57
aVbut it's also antibodies, sugars, hormones, that kind of thing.
p58
aVAnd the red region is a slice into a red blood cell.
p59
aVAnd those red molecules are hemoglobin.
p60
aVThey are actually red; that's what gives blood its color.
p61
aVAnd hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge
p62
aVto soak up the oxygen in your lungs
p63
aVand then carry it to other parts of the body.
p64
aa(lp65
VI was very much inspired by this image many years ago,
p66
aVand I wondered whether we could use computer graphics
p67
aVto represent the molecular world.
p68
aVWhat would it look like?
p69
aVAnd that's how I really began.
p70
aVSo let's begin.
p71
aa(lp72
VThis is DNA in its classic double helix form.
p73
aVAnd it's from X-ray crystallography, so it's an accurate model of DNA.
p74
aVIf we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands,
p75
aVyou see these things that look like teeth.
p76
aVThose are the letters of genetic code,
p77
aVthe 25,000 genes you've got written in your DNA.
p78
aVThis is what they typically talk about \u2014 the genetic code \u2014
p79
aVthis is what they're talking about.
p80
aVBut I want to talk about a different aspect of DNA science,
p81
aVand that is the physical nature of DNA.
p82
aVIt's these two strands that run in opposite directions
p83
aVfor reasons I can't go into right now.
p84
aVBut they physically run in opposite directions,
p85
aVwhich creates a number of complications for your living cells,
p86
aVas you're about to see,
p87
aVmost particularly when DNA is being copied.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd so what I'm about to show you
p90
aVis an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine
p91
aVthat's occurring right now inside your body,
p92
aVat least 2002 biology.
p93
aVSo DNA's entering the production line from the left-hand side,
p94
aVand it hits this collection, these miniature biochemical machines,
p95
aVthat are pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy.
p96
aVSo DNA comes in and hits this blue, doughnut-shaped structure
p97
aVand it's ripped apart into its two strands.
p98
aVOne strand can be copied directly,
p99
aVand you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there.
p100
aVBut things aren't so simple for the other strand
p101
aVbecause it must be copied backwards.
p102
aVSo it's thrown out repeatedly in these loops
p103
aVand copied one section at a time, creating two new DNA molecules.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you,
p106
aVcopying your DNA with exquisite fidelity.
p107
aVIt's an accurate representation,
p108
aVand it's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you.
p109
aVI've left out error correction and a bunch of other things.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VThis was work from a number of years ago\u2014
p114
aVThank you.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VThis is work from a number of years ago,
p119
aVbut what I'll show you next is updated science,
p120
aVit's updated technology.
p121
aVSo again, we begin with DNA.
p122
aVAnd it's jiggling and wiggling there
p123
aVbecause of the surrounding soup of molecules,
p124
aVwhich I've stripped away so you can see something.
p125
aVDNA is about two nanometers across, which is really quite tiny.
p126
aVBut in each one of your cells,
p127
aVeach strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long.
p128
aVSo to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code,
p129
aVit's wrapped around these purple proteins \u2014
p130
aVor I've labeled them purple here.
p131
aVIt's packaged up and bundled up.
p132
aVAll this field of view is a single strand of DNA.
p133
aVThis huge package of DNA is called a chromosome.
p134
aVAnd we'll come back to chromosomes in a minute.
p135
aa(lp136
VWe're pulling out, we're zooming out,
p137
aVout through a nuclear pore,
p138
aVwhich is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the DNA,
p139
aVcalled the nucleus.
p140
aVAll of this field of view is about a semester's worth of biology,
p141
aVand I've got seven minutes,
p142
aVSo we're not going to be able to do that today?
p143
aVNo, I'm being told, "No."
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope.
p146
aVAnd it's been filmed under time-lapse, which is why you can see it moving.
p147
aVThe nuclear envelope breaks down.
p148
aVThese sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes,
p149
aVand we'll focus on them.
p150
aVThey go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots.
p151
aVWhen the cell feels it's ready to go, it rips apart the chromosome.
p152
aVOne set of DNA goes to one side,
p153
aVthe other side gets the other set of DNA \u2014
p154
aVidentical copies of DNA.
p155
aVAnd then the cell splits down the middle.
p156
aVAnd again, you have billions of cells undergoing this process
p157
aVright now inside of you.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow we're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes,
p160
aVand look at its structure and describe it.
p161
aVSo again, here we are at that equator moment.
p162
aVThe chromosomes line up.
p163
aVAnd if we isolate just one chromosome,
p164
aVwe're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure.
p165
aVSo this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have,
p166
aVat least as far as we've discovered so far inside of us.
p167
aVSo this is a single chromosome.
p168
aVAnd you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome.
p169
aVOne is bundled up into one sausage.
p170
aVThe other strand is bundled up into the other sausage.
p171
aa(lp172
VThese things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side
p173
aVare the dynamic scaffolding of the cell.
p174
aVThey're called microtubules, that name's not important.
p175
aVBut we're going to focus on the region labeled red here \u2014
p176
aVand it's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding
p177
aVand the chromosomes.
p178
aVIt is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes.
p179
aVWe have no idea, really, as to how it's achieving that movement.
p180
aa(lp181
VWe've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore
p182
aVfor over a hundred years with intense study,
p183
aVand we're still just beginning to discover what it's about.
p184
aVIt is made up of about 200 different types of proteins,
p185
aVthousands of proteins in total.
p186
aVIt is a signal broadcasting system.
p187
aVIt broadcasts through chemical signals,
p188
aVtelling the rest of the cell when it's ready,
p189
aVwhen it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go
p190
aVfor the separation of the chromosomes.
p191
aVIt is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules.
p192
aa(lp193
VIt's involved with the growing of the microtubules,
p194
aVand it's able to transiently couple onto them.
p195
aVIt's also an attention-sensing system.
p196
aVIt's able to feel when the cell is ready,
p197
aVwhen the chromosome is correctly positioned.
p198
aVIt's turning green here because it feels that everything is just right.
p199
aVAnd you'll see, there's this one little last bit
p200
aVthat's still remaining red.
p201
aVAnd it's walked away down the microtubules.
p202
aVThat is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal.
p203
aVAnd it's walked away \u2014 I mean, it's that mechanical.
p204
aVIt's molecular clockwork.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis is how you work at the molecular scale.
p207
aVSo with a little bit of molecular eye candy,
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
Vwe've got kinesins, the orange ones.
p212
aVThey're little molecular courier molecules walking one way.
p213
aVAnd here are the dynein, they're carrying that broadcasting system.
p214
aVAnd they've got their long legs
p215
aVso they can step around obstacles and so on.
p216
aVSo again, this is all derived accurately from the science.
p217
aVThe problem is we can't show it to you any other way.
p218
aa(lp219
VExploring at the frontier of science, at the frontier of human understanding,
p220
aVis mind-blowing.
p221
aVDiscovering this stuff
p222
aVis certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science.
p223
aVBut most medical researchers \u2014
p224
aVdiscovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals,
p225
aVwhich are to eradicate disease, to eliminate the suffering
p226
aVand the misery that disease causes
p227
aVand to lift people out of poverty.
p228
aa(lp229
VThank you.

VImagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name;
p5
aVa place with splendid vistas;
p6
aVa place where you can drive just 20 minutes
p7
aVand put your sailboat on the water.
p8
aVIt's a seductive place, isn't it?
p9
aa(lp10
VI don't live there.
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aVBut I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip
p13
aVfor two years, to the fastest-growing and whitest counties in America.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhat is a Whitopia?
p16
aVI define Whitopia in three ways:
p17
aVFirst, a Whitopia has posted at least six percent population growth since 2000.
p18
aVSecondly, the majority of that growth comes from white migrants.
p19
aVAnd third, the Whitopia has an ineffable charm,
p20
aVa pleasant look and feel,
p21
aVa je Ne sais quoi.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VTo learn how and why Whitopias are ticking,
p25
aVI immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them:
p26
aVfirst, St. George, Utah;
p27
aVsecond, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho;
p28
aVand third, Forsyth County, Georgia.
p29
aa(lp30
VFirst stop, St. George \u2014 a beautiful town of red rock landscapes.
p31
aVIn the 1850s, Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George
p32
aVto grow cotton because of the hot, arid climate.
p33
aVAnd so they called it Utah's Dixie, and the name sticks to this day.
p34
aVI approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist.
p35
aVI made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities,
p36
aVwho I needed to meet, where I needed to be,
p37
aVand I threw myself with gusto in these communities.
p38
aVI went to zoning board meetings,
p39
aVI went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs.
p40
aVI went to poker nights.
p41
aVIn St. George, I rented a home at the Entrada,
p42
aVone of the town's premier gated communities.
p43
aVThere were no Motel 6's or Howard Johnsons for me.
p44
aVI lived in Whitopia as a resident, and not like a visitor.
p45
aa(lp46
VI rented myself this home by phone.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aV(Applause)
p49
aa(lp50
VGolf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia.
p51
aVWhen I went on my journey,
p52
aVI had barely ever held a golf club.
p53
aVBy the time I left, I was golfing at least three times a week.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VGolf helps people bond.
p57
aVSome of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses.
p58
aVOne venture capitalist, for example, invited me to golf in his private club
p59
aVthat had no minority members.
p60
aa(lp61
VI also went fishing.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVBecause I had never fished, this fellow had to teach me
p64
aVhow to cast my line and what bait to use.
p65
aa(lp66
VI also played poker every weekend.
p67
aVIt was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in.
p68
aVMy poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew,
p69
aVbut they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs.
p70
aVSome of the most raw, salty conversations I ever had
p71
aVduring my journey were at the poker table.
p72
aa(lp73
VI'm a gung ho entertainer.
p74
aVI love to cook, I hosted many dinner parties, and in return,
p75
aVpeople invited me to their dinner parties,
p76
aVand to their barbecues, and to their pool parties,
p77
aVand to their birthday parties.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut it wasn't all fun.
p80
aVImmigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia.
p81
aVThe St. George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration
p82
aVheld regular and active protests against immigration,
p83
aVand so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become.
p84
aVIt was a real-time preview, and so it has become.
p85
aa(lp86
VNext stop: Almost Heaven, a cabin I rented for myself
p87
aVin Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful North Idaho panhandle.
p88
aVI rented this place for myself, also by phone.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VThe book "A Thousand Places To See Before You Die" lists Coeur d'Alene \u2014
p92
aVit's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen, boatmen and fishermen.
p93
aa(lp94
VMy growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene.
p95
aVI golfed with retired LAPD cops.
p96
aVIn 1993, around 11,000 families and cops
p97
aVfled Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest,
p98
aVfor North Idaho, and they've built an expatriated community.
p99
aVGiven the conservatism of these cops,
p100
aVthere's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture.
p101
aVIn fact, it is said, North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations.
p102
aVSo what's a resident to do to fit in?
p103
aVI hit the gun club.
p104
aVWhen I rented a gun, the gentleman behind the counter
p105
aVwas perfectly pleasant and kind,
p106
aVuntil I showed him my New York City driver's license.
p107
aVThat's when he got nervous.
p108
aVI'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been.
p109
aa(lp110
VWhat I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia
p111
aVthat can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around.
p112
aa(lp113
VIn North Idaho, in my red pickup truck,
p114
aVI kept a notepad.
p115
aVAnd in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people.
p116
aVIn North Idaho, I found Confederate flags
p117
aVon key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia,
p118
aVand on cars.
p119
aa(lp120
VAbout a seven-minute drive from my hidden lake cabin
p121
aVwas the compound of Aryan Nations,
p122
aVthe white supremacist group.
p123
aVAmerica's Promise Ministries, the religious arm of Aryan Nations,
p124
aVhappened to have a three-day retreat during my visit.
p125
aVSo I decided to crash it.
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aVI'm the only non-Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVAmong the many memorable episodes of that retreat...
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aV...is when Abe, an Aryan, sidled up next to me.
p132
aVHe slapped my knee, and he said, "Hey Rich, I just want you to know one thing.
p133
aVWe are not white supremacists. We are white separatists.
p134
aVWe don't think we're better than you,
p135
aVwe just want to be away from you."
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VIndeed, most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists
p139
aVor white separatists;
p140
aVin fact, they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all.
p141
aVRather, they emigrate there
p142
aVfor friendliness, comfort, security, safety \u2014
p143
aVreasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself.
p144
aa(lp145
VNext stop was Georgia.
p146
aVIn Georgia, I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta.
p147
aVIn Utah, I found poker;
p148
aVin Idaho, I found guns;
p149
aVin Georgia, I found God.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aVThe way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia
p152
aVwas to become active at First Redeemer Church,
p153
aVa megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts
p154
aVto escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus.
p155
aVI was active in the youth ministry.
p156
aVAnd for me, personally, I was more comfortable in this Whitopia
p157
aVthan say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho, or even a suburban Boston.
p158
aVThat is because [there], in Georgia,
p159
aVwhite people and black people are more historically familiar to one another.
p160
aVI was less exotic in this Whitopia.
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VBut what does it all mean?
p164
aVWhitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration, is a push-pull phenomenon,
p165
aVfull of alarming pushes and alluring pulls,
p166
aVand Whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias.
p167
aVIt's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons,
p168
aVthough it has racist outcomes.
p169
aVMany Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,
p170
aVsocial welfare abuse, minorities, density, crowded schools.
p171
aVMany Whitopians feel pulled by merit,
p172
aVfreedom, the allure of privatism \u2014 privatized places, privatized people,
p173
aVprivatized things.
p174
aVAnd I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism
p175
aVwithout racists.
p176
aa(lp177
VMany of my smug urban liberal friends
p178
aVcouldn't believe I would go on such a venture.
p179
aVThe reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind.
p180
aVInterpersonal race relations \u2014 how we treat each other as human beings \u2014
p181
aVare vastly better than in my parents' generation.
p182
aVCan you imagine me going to Whitopia 40 years ago?
p183
aVWhat a journey that would have been.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aVAnd yet, some things haven't changed.
p186
aVAmerica is as residentially and educationally segregated today
p187
aVas it was in 1970.
p188
aa(lp189
VAs Americans, we often find ways to cook for each other,
p190
aVto dance with each other,
p191
aVto host with each other,
p192
aVbut why can't that translate into how we treat each other as communities?
p193
aVIt's a devastating irony,
p194
aVhow we have gone forward as individuals,
p195
aVand backwards as communities.
p196
aa(lp197
VOne of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me
p198
aVwas a proverbial saying:
p199
aV"One black man is a delightful dinner guest;
p200
aV50 black men is a ghetto."
p201
aa(lp202
VOne of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year 2042.
p203
aVBy 2042, white people will no longer be the American majority.
p204
aVAs such, will there be more Whitopias?
p205
aVIn looking at this,
p206
aVthe danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have,
p207
aVthe less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias.
p208
aa(lp209
VI ventured on my two-year, 27,000 mile journey
p210
aVto learn where, why, and how white people are fleeing,
p211
aVbut I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey.
p212
aV(Laughter)
p213
aVI didn't expect to learn so much about myself.
p214
aVI don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia \u2014
p215
aVor a Blacktopia, for that matter.
p216
aVI do plan to continue golfing every chance I get.
p217
aV(Laughter)
p218
aVAnd I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia.
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you.

VSo recently, we heard a lot about how social media helps empower protest,
p5
aVand that's true,
p6
aVbut after more than a decade
p7
aVof studying and participating in multiple social movements,
p8
aVI've come to realize
p9
aVthat the way technology empowers social movements
p10
aVcan also paradoxically help weaken them.
p11
aVThis is not inevitable, but overcoming it requires diving deep
p12
aVinto what makes success possible over the long term.
p13
aVAnd the lessons apply in multiple domains.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, take Turkey's Gezi Park protests, July 2013,
p16
aVwhich I went back to study in the field.
p17
aVTwitter was key to its organizing.
p18
aVIt was everywhere in the park \u2014 well, along with a lot of tear gas.
p19
aVIt wasn't all high tech.
p20
aVBut the people in Turkey had already gotten used to the power of Twitter
p21
aVbecause of an unfortunate incident about a year before
p22
aVwhen military jets had bombed and killed
p23
aV34 Kurdish smugglers near the border region,
p24
aVand Turkish media completely censored this news.
p25
aVEditors sat in their newsrooms
p26
aVand waited for the government to tell them what to do.
p27
aVOne frustrated journalist could not take this anymore.
p28
aVHe purchased his own plane ticket,
p29
aVand went to the village where this had occurred.
p30
aVAnd he was confronted by this scene:
p31
aVa line of coffins coming down a hill, relatives wailing.
p32
aVHe later he told me how overwhelmed he felt,
p33
aVand didn't know what to do,
p34
aVso he took out his phone,
p35
aVlike any one of us might,
p36
aVand snapped that picture and tweeted it out.
p37
aVAnd voila, that picture went viral
p38
aVand broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo when, a year later, Turkey's Gezi protests happened,
p41
aVit started as a protest about a park being razed,
p42
aVbut became an anti-authoritarian protest.
p43
aVIt wasn't surprising that media also censored it,
p44
aVbut it got a little ridiculous at times.
p45
aVWhen things were so intense,
p46
aVwhen CNN International was broadcasting live from Istanbul,
p47
aVCNN Turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins.
p48
aVNow, I love penguin documentaries, but that wasn't the news of the day.
p49
aVAn angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture,
p50
aVand that one too went viral,
p51
aVand since then, people call Turkish media the penguin media. (Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VBut this time, people knew what to do.
p54
aVThey just took out their phones and looked for actual news.
p55
aVBetter, they knew to go to the park and take pictures and participate
p56
aVand share it more on social media.
p57
aVDigital connectivity was used for everything from food to donations.
p58
aVEverything was organized partially with the help of these new technologies.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd using Internet to mobilize and publicize protests
p61
aVactually goes back a long way.
p62
aVRemember the Zapatistas,
p63
aVthe peasant uprising in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico
p64
aVled by the masked, pipe-smoking, charismatic Subcomandante Marcos?
p65
aVThat was probably the first movement
p66
aVthat got global attention thanks to the Internet.
p67
aVOr consider Seattle '99,
p68
aVwhen a multinational grassroots effort brought global attention
p69
aVto what was then an obscure organization, the World Trade Organization,
p70
aVby also utilizing these digital technologies to help them organize.
p71
aVAnd more recently, movement after movement
p72
aVhas shaken country after country:
p73
aVthe Arab uprisings from Bahrain to Tunisia to Egypt and more;
p74
aVindignados in Spain, Italy, Greece; the Gezi Park protests;
p75
aVTaiwan; Euromaidan in Ukraine; Hong Kong.
p76
aVAnd think of more recent initiatives, like the #BringBackOurGirls hashtags.
p77
aVNowadays, a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign.
p78
aVA Facebook page can become the hub of a massive mobilization.
p79
aVAmazing.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut think of the moments I just mentioned.
p82
aVThe achievements they were able to have, their outcomes,
p83
aVare not really proportional to the size and energy they inspired.
p84
aVThe hopes they rightfully raised are not really matched
p85
aVby what they were able to have as a result in the end.
p86
aVAnd this raises a question:
p87
aVAs digital technology makes things easier for movements,
p88
aVwhy haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well?
p89
aVIn embracing digital platforms for activism and politics,
p90
aVare we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way?
p91
aVNow, I believe so.
p92
aVI believe that the rule of thumb is:
p93
aVEasier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, to be clear,
p96
aVtechnology does empower in multiple ways.
p97
aVIt's very powerful.
p98
aVIn Turkey, I watched four young college students
p99
aVorganize a countrywide citizen journalism network called 140Journos
p100
aVthat became the central hub for uncensored news in the country.
p101
aVIn Egypt, I saw another four young people use digital connectivity
p102
aVto organize the supplies and logistics for 10 field hospitals,
p103
aVvery large operations,
p104
aVduring massive clashes near Tahrir Square in 2011.
p105
aVAnd I asked the founder of this effort, called Tahrir Supplies,
p106
aVhow long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started.
p107
aV"Five minutes," he said. Five minutes.
p108
aVAnd he had no training or background in logistics.
p109
aVOr think of the Occupy movement which rocked the world in 2011.
p110
aVIt started with a single email
p111
aVfrom a magazine, Adbusters, to 90,000 subscribers in its list.
p112
aVAbout two months after that first email,
p113
aVthere were in the United States 600 ongoing occupations and protests.
p114
aVLess than one month after the first physical occupation in Zuccotti Park,
p115
aVa global protest was held in about 82 countries, 950 cities.
p116
aVIt was one of the largest global protests ever organized.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, compare that to what the Civil Rights Movement had to do in 1955 Alabama
p119
aVto protest the racially segregated bus system, which they wanted to boycott.
p120
aVThey'd been preparing for many years
p121
aVand decided it was time to swing into action
p122
aVafter Rosa Parks was arrested.
p123
aVBut how do you get the word out \u2014
p124
aVtomorrow we're going to start the boycott \u2014
p125
aVwhen you don't have Facebook, texting, Twitter, none of that?
p126
aVSo they had to mimeograph 52,000 leaflets
p127
aVby sneaking into a university duplicating room
p128
aVand working all night, secretly.
p129
aVThey then used the 68 African-American organizations
p130
aVthat criss-crossed the city to distribute those leaflets by hand.
p131
aVAnd the logistical tasks were daunting, because these were poor people.
p132
aVThey had to get to work, boycott or no,
p133
aVso a massive carpool was organized,
p134
aVagain by meeting.
p135
aVNo texting, no Twitter, no Facebook.
p136
aVThey had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going.
p137
aa(lp138
VToday, it would be so much easier.
p139
aVWe could create a database, available rides and what rides you need,
p140
aVhave the database coordinate, and use texting.
p141
aVWe wouldn't have to meet all that much.
p142
aVBut again, consider this:
p143
aVthe Civil Rights Movement in the United States
p144
aVnavigated a minefield of political dangers,
p145
aVfaced repression and overcame, won major policy concessions,
p146
aVnavigated and innovated through risks.
p147
aVIn contrast, three years after Occupy sparked
p148
aVthat global conversation about inequality,
p149
aVthe policies that fueled it are still in place.
p150
aVEurope was also rocked by anti-austerity protests,
p151
aVbut the continent didn't shift its direction.
p152
aVIn embracing these technologies,
p153
aVare we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustained?
p154
aVTo understand this,
p155
aVI went back to Turkey about a year after the Gezi protests
p156
aVand I interviewed a range of people,
p157
aVfrom activists to politicians,
p158
aVfrom both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements.
p159
aVI found that the Gezi protesters were despairing.
p160
aVThey were frustrated,
p161
aVand they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for.
p162
aVThis echoed what I'd been hearing around the world
p163
aVfrom many other protesters that I'm in touch with.
p164
aVAnd I've come to realize that part of the problem
p165
aVis that today's protests have become a bit like climbing Mt. Everest
p166
aVwith the help of 60 Sherpas,
p167
aVand the Internet is our Sherpa.
p168
aVWhat we're doing is taking the fast routes
p169
aVand not replacing the benefits of the slower work.
p170
aVBecause, you see,
p171
aVthe kind of work that went into organizing
p172
aVall those daunting, tedious logistical tasks
p173
aVdid not just take care of those tasks,
p174
aVthey also created the kind of organization that could think together collectively
p175
aVand make hard decisions together,
p176
aVcreate consensus and innovate, and maybe even more crucially,
p177
aVkeep going together through differences.
p178
aVSo when you see this March on Washington in 1963,
p179
aVwhen you look at that picture,
p180
aVwhere this is the march where Martin Luther King gave his famous
p181
aV"I have a dream" speech, 1963,
p182
aVyou don't just see a march and you don't just hear a powerful speech,
p183
aVyou also see the painstaking, long-term work that can put on that march.
p184
aVAnd if you're in power,
p185
aVyou realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march,
p186
aVnot just the march, but the capacity signaled by that march, seriously.
p187
aVIn contrast, when you look at Occupy's global marches
p188
aVthat were organized in two weeks,
p189
aVyou see a lot of discontent,
p190
aVbut you don't necessarily see teeth that can bite over the long term.
p191
aVAnd crucially, the Civil Rights Movement innovated tactically
p192
aVfrom boycotts to lunch counter sit-ins to pickets to marches to freedom rides.
p193
aVToday's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base
p194
aVthat can see them through the challenges.
p195
aVThey feel a little like startups that got very big
p196
aVwithout knowing what to do next,
p197
aVand they rarely manage to shift tactically
p198
aVbecause they don't have the depth of capacity
p199
aVto weather such transitions.
p200
aa(lp201
VNow, I want to be clear: The magic is not in the mimeograph.
p202
aVIt's in that capacity to work together, think together collectively,
p203
aVwhich can only be built over time with a lot of work.
p204
aVTo understand all this,
p205
aVI interviewed a top official from the ruling party in Turkey,
p206
aVand I ask him, "How do you do it?"
p207
aVThey too use digital technology extensively, so that's not it.
p208
aVSo what's the secret?
p209
aVWell, he told me.
p210
aVHe said the key is he never took sugar with his tea.
p211
aVI said, what has that got to do with anything?
p212
aVWell, he said, his party starts getting ready for the next election
p213
aVthe day after the last one,
p214
aVand he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes,
p215
aVin their wedding parties, circumcision ceremonies,
p216
aVand then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes.
p217
aVWith that many meetings every day, with tea offered at every one of them,
p218
aVwhich he could not refuse, because that would be rude,
p219
aVhe could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea,
p220
aVbecause that would be many kilos of sugar, he can't even calculate how many kilos,
p221
aVand at that point I realized why he was speaking so fast.
p222
aVWe had met in the afternoon, and he was already way over-caffeinated.
p223
aVBut his party won two major elections
p224
aVwithin a year of the Gezi protests with comfortable margins.
p225
aVTo be sure, governments have different resources to bring to the table.
p226
aVIt's not the same game, but the differences are instructive.
p227
aVAnd like all such stories, this is not a story just of technology.
p228
aVIt's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do.
p229
aVToday's social movements want to operate informally.
p230
aVThey do not want institutional leadership.
p231
aVThey want to stay out of politics because they fear corruption and cooptation.
p232
aVThey have a point.
p233
aVModern representative democracies are being strangled in many countries
p234
aVby powerful interests.
p235
aVBut operating this way makes it hard for them
p236
aVto sustain over the long term and exert leverage over the system,
p237
aVwhich leads to frustrated protesters dropping out,
p238
aVand even more corrupt politics.
p239
aVAnd politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles,
p240
aVbecause the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial.
p241
aVClimate change is barreling towards us.
p242
aVInequality is stifling human growth and potential and economies.
p243
aVAuthoritarianism is choking many countries.
p244
aVWe need movements to be more effective.
p245
aa(lp246
VNow, some people have argued that the problem is
p247
aVtoday's movements are not formed of people who take as many risks as before,
p248
aVand that is not true.
p249
aVFrom Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere,
p250
aVI've seen people put their lives and livelihoods on the line.
p251
aVIt's also not true, as Malcolm Gladwell claimed,
p252
aVthat today's protesters form weaker virtual ties.
p253
aVNo, they come to these protests, just like before,
p254
aVwith their friends, existing networks,
p255
aVand sometimes they do make new friends for life.
p256
aVI still see the friends that I made
p257
aVin those Zapatista-convened global protests more than a decade ago,
p258
aVand the bonds between strangers are not worthless.
p259
aVWhen I got tear-gassed in Gezi,
p260
aVpeople I didn't know helped me and one another instead of running away.
p261
aVIn Tahrir, I saw people, protesters,
p262
aVworking really hard to keep each other safe and protected.
p263
aVAnd digital awareness-raising is great,
p264
aVbecause changing minds is the bedrock of changing politics.
p265
aVBut movements today have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast
p266
aVand figure out how to think together collectively,
p267
aVdevelop strong policy proposals, create consensus,
p268
aVfigure out the political steps and relate them to leverage,
p269
aVbecause all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself
p270
aVare not going to be enough.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd there are many efforts.
p273
aVIn New Zealand, a group of young people are developing a platform called Loomio
p274
aVfor participatory decision making at scale.
p275
aVIn Turkey, 140Journos are holding hack-a-thons
p276
aVso that they support communities as well as citizen journalism.
p277
aVIn Argentina, an open-source platform called DemocracyOS
p278
aVis bringing participation to parliaments and political parties.
p279
aVThese are all great, and we need more,
p280
aVbut the answer won't just be better online decision-making,
p281
aVbecause to update democracy, we are going to need to innovate at every level,
p282
aVfrom the organizational to the political to the social.
p283
aVBecause to succeed over the long term,
p284
aVsometimes you do need tea without sugar
p285
aValong with your Twitter.
p286
aVThank you.
p287
aV(Applause)

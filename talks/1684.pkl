VThe Kraken, a beast so terrifying
p5
aVit was said to devour men and ships and whales,
p6
aVand so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.
p7
aVIn assessing the merits of such tales,
p8
aVit's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw
p9
aVthat the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story
p10
aVis a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time,"
p11
aVand a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit." (Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VEvery fish that gets away
p14
aVgrows with every telling of the tale.
p15
aVNevertheless, there are giants in the ocean,
p16
aVand we now have video proof,
p17
aVas those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.
p18
aa(lp19
VI was one of the three scientists on this expedition
p20
aVthat took place last summer off Japan.
p21
aVI'm the short one.
p22
aVThe other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea.
p23
aa(lp24
VI owe my participation in this now-historic event
p25
aVto TED.
p26
aVIn 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue
p27
aVheld aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos
p28
aVas part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.
p29
aVI spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean,
p30
aVone that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.
p31
aVMike deGruy was also invited,
p32
aVand he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean,
p33
aVand he also talked to me about applying my approach
p34
aVto something he's been involved with for a very long time,
p35
aVwhich is the hunt for the giant squid.
p36
aVIt was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit,
p37
aVa gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel
p38
aVthat summer during Shark Week. (Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VI gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing
p41
aVand optical luring of deep sea squid
p42
aVin which I emphasized the importance
p43
aVof using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.
p44
aVThis came out of hundreds of dives I have made,
p45
aVfarting around in the dark
p46
aVusing these platforms,
p47
aVand my impression that I saw more animals
p48
aVworking from the submersible
p49
aVthan I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.
p50
aVBut that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.
p51
aVBut I also felt like I saw more animals
p52
aVworking with the Tiburon than the Ventana,
p53
aVtwo vehicles with the same field of view
p54
aVbut different propulsion systems.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.
p57
aVSo I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean,
p58
aVand I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance
p59
aVand recorded the sound they made.
p60
aVThe Johnson Sea-Link \u2014 (whirring noise) \u2014
p61
aVwhich you can probably just barely hear here,
p62
aVuses electric thrusters \u2014 very, very quiet.
p63
aVThe Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.
p64
aVIt's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier. (Louder whirring noise)
p65
aVBut most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics
p66
aVand they sound like the Ventana. (Loud beeping noise)
p67
aVI think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo for the deep sea squid hunt,
p70
aVI proposed using an optical lure
p71
aVattached to a camera platform
p72
aVwith no thrusters, no motors,
p73
aVjust a battery-powered camera,
p74
aVand the only illumination coming from red light
p75
aVthat's invisible to most deep-sea animals
p76
aVthat are adapted to see primarily blue.
p77
aVThat's visible to our eye,
p78
aVbut it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.
p79
aVSo this camera platform, which we called the Medusa,
p80
aVcould just be thrown off the back of the ship,
p81
aVattached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line,
p82
aVit would just float around passively carried by the currents,
p83
aVand the only light visible to the animals in the deep
p84
aVwould be the blue light of the optical lure,
p85
aVwhich we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly,
p86
aVbecause it was designed to imitate
p87
aVthe bioluminescent display
p88
aVof the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces
p91
aVis known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm
p92
aVand is a form of defense.
p93
aVThe reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure
p94
aVis not because giant squid eat jellyfish,
p95
aVbut it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light
p96
aVwhen it's being chewed on by a predator
p97
aVand its only hope for escape
p98
aVmay be to attract the attention of a larger predator
p99
aVthat will attack its attacker
p100
aVand thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.
p101
aVIt's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape,
p102
aVand a common form of defense in the deep sea.
p103
aa(lp104
VThe approach worked.
p105
aVWhereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner
p106
aVa single video glimpse of the giant,
p107
aVwe managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.
p108
aa(lp109
VEdith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.
p110
aa(lp111
VEW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance \u2014
p112
aVnow you see me, now you don't \u2014
p113
aVand we had four such teasing appearances,
p114
aVand then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Music) Narrator: (Speaking in Japanese)
p117
aa(lp118
VScientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa!
p119
aa(lp120
V(Applause)
p121
aa(lp122
VEW: The full monty.
p123
aa(lp124
VWhat really wowed me about that
p125
aVwas the way it came in up over the e-jelly
p126
aVand then attacked the enormous thing next to it,
p127
aVwhich I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut even more incredible was the footage shot
p130
aVfrom the Triton submersible.
p131
aVWhat was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary
p132
aVwas that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used,
p133
aVa one-meter long diamondback squid
p134
aVhad a light attached to it, a squid jig
p135
aVof the type that longline fishermen use,
p136
aVand I think it was this light
p137
aVthat brought the giant in.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, what you're seeing
p140
aVis the intensified camera's view under red light,
p141
aVand that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.
p142
aVAnd then he got so excited,
p143
aVhe turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better,
p144
aVand the giant didn't run away,
p145
aVso he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible,
p146
aVbringing a creature of legend
p147
aVfrom the misty history into high-resolution video.
p148
aVIt was absolutely breathtaking,
p149
aVand had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact
p150
aVand fully extended,
p151
aVit would have been as tall as a two-story house.
p152
aa(lp153
VHow could something that big
p154
aVlive in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?
p155
aVWe've only explored about five percent of our ocean.
p156
aVThere are great discoveries yet to be made down there,
p157
aVfantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution
p158
aVand possibly bioactive compounds
p159
aVthat could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.
p160
aVYet we have spent only a tiny fraction
p161
aVof the money on ocean exploration
p162
aVthat we've spent on space exploration.
p163
aVWe need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration,
p164
aVbecause we need to be exploring and protecting
p165
aVour life support systems here on Earth.
p166
aa(lp167
VWe need \u2014 thank you. (Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
VExploration is the engine that drives innovation.
p170
aVInnovation drives economic growth.
p171
aVSo let's all go exploring,
p172
aVbut let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away,
p173
aVor, as Mike deGruy once said,
p174
aV"If you want to get away from it all
p175
aVand see something you've never seen,
p176
aVor have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen,
p177
aVget in a sub."
p178
aVHe should have been with us for this adventure.
p179
aVWe miss him.
p180
aV(Applause)

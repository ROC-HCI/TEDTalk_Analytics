VWe invent.
p5
aVMy company invents
p6
aVall kinds of new technology
p7
aVin lots of different areas.
p8
aVAnd we do that for a couple of reasons.
p9
aVWe invent for fun \u2014
p10
aVinvention is a lot of fun to do \u2014
p11
aVand we also invent for profit.
p12
aVThe two are related because
p13
aVthe profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun,
p14
aVyou wouldn't have the time to do it.
p15
aVSo we do this
p16
aVfun and profit-oriented inventing
p17
aVfor most of what we do,
p18
aVbut we also have a program where we invent for humanity \u2014
p19
aVwhere we take some of our best inventors,
p20
aVand we say, "Are there problems
p21
aVwhere we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has?" \u2014
p22
aVand to solve it in the way we try to solve problems,
p23
aVwhich is with dramatic, crazy,
p24
aVout-of-the-box solutions.
p25
aVBill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours
p26
aVthat work on these problems
p27
aVand he also funds this work, so thank you.
p28
aVSo I'm going to briefly discuss
p29
aVa couple of problems that we have
p30
aVand a couple of problems where
p31
aVwe've got some solutions underway.
p32
aa(lp33
VVaccination is one of the
p34
aVkey techniques in public health,
p35
aVa fantastic thing.
p36
aVBut in the developing world a lot of vaccines
p37
aVspoil before they're administered,
p38
aVand that's because they need to be kept cold.
p39
aVAlmost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures.
p40
aVThey go bad very quickly if you don't,
p41
aVand if you don't have stable power grid, this doesn't happen,
p42
aVso kids die.
p43
aVIt's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters;
p44
aVit's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated.
p45
aVThis is one of the ways that
p46
aVvaccines are carried:
p47
aVThese are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people,
p48
aVbut they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks.
p49
aVWe've got a different solution.
p50
aVNow, one of these Styrofoam chests
p51
aVwill last for about four hours with ice in it.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd we thought, well, that's not really good enough.
p54
aVSo we made this thing.
p55
aVThis lasts six months with no power;
p56
aVabsolutely zero power,
p57
aVbecause it loses less
p58
aVthan a half a watt.
p59
aVNow, this is our second generations prototype.
p60
aVThe third generation prototype is, right now,
p61
aVin Uganda being tested.
p62
aVNow, the reason we were able to come up with this
p63
aVis two key ideas:
p64
aVOne is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar,
p65
aVsomething you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.
p66
aVThey have incredible insulation,
p67
aVso let's put some incredible insulation here.
p68
aVThe other idea is kind of interesting,
p69
aVwhich is, you can't reach inside anymore.
p70
aVBecause if you open it up and reach inside,
p71
aVyou'd let the heat in, the game would be over.
p72
aVSo the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine.
p73
aVIt vends out little individual vials.
p74
aVSo a simple idea,
p75
aVwhich we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed
p76
aVin Africa and around the world.
p77
aa(lp78
VWe'll move on to malaria.
p79
aVMalaria is one of the great public health problems.
p80
aVEsther Duflo talked a little bit about this.
p81
aVTwo hundred million people a year.
p82
aVEvery 43 seconds a child in Africa dies;
p83
aV27 will die during my talk.
p84
aVAnd there's no way for us here in this country
p85
aVto grasp really what that means to the people involved.
p86
aVAnother comment of Esther's
p87
aVwas that we react when there's
p88
aVa tragedy like Haiti,
p89
aVbut that tragedy is ongoing.
p90
aVSo what can we do about it?
p91
aVWell, there are a lot of things people have tried
p92
aVfor many years for solving malaria.
p93
aVYou can spray; the problem is there are environmental issues.
p94
aVYou can try to treat people and create awareness.
p95
aVThat's great, except the places that have malaria really bad,
p96
aVthey don't have health care systems.
p97
aVA vaccine would be a terrific thing,
p98
aVonly they don't work yet.
p99
aVPeople have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates.
p100
aVIt's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for.
p101
aVYou can distribute bed nets,
p102
aVand bed nets are very effective if you use them.
p103
aVYou don't always use them for that. People fish with them.
p104
aVThey don't always get to everyone.
p105
aVAnd bed nets
p106
aVhave an effect on the epidemic,
p107
aVbut you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow, malaria is
p110
aVan incredibly complicated disease.
p111
aVWe could spend hours going over this.
p112
aVIt's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle;
p113
aVthey have sex, they burrow into your liver,
p114
aVthey tunnel into your blood cells ...
p115
aVit's an incredibly complicated disease,
p116
aVbut that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it
p117
aVand why we work on malaria:
p118
aVThere's a lot of potential ways in.
p119
aVOne of those ways might be better diagnosis.
p120
aVSo we hope this year
p121
aVto prototype each of these devices.
p122
aVOne does an automatic malaria diagnosis
p123
aVin the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works:
p124
aVYou take a drop of blood,
p125
aVyou put it in there and it automatically tells you.
p126
aVToday, you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure,
p127
aVcreate a bunch of microscope slides
p128
aVand have a trained person examine it.
p129
aa(lp130
VThe other thing is, you know,
p131
aVit would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood.
p132
aVAnd if you look through the eye,
p133
aVor you look at the vessels on the white of the eye,
p134
aVin fact, you may be able to do this
p135
aVdirectly, without drawing any blood at all,
p136
aVor through your nail beds.
p137
aVBecause if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels,
p138
aVand once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.
p139
aVWe can see it because of this molecule
p140
aVcalled hemozoin.
p141
aVIt's produced by the malaria parasite
p142
aVand it's a very interesting crystalline substance.
p143
aVInteresting, anyway, if you're a solid-state physicist.
p144
aVThere's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it.
p145
aa(lp146
VThis is our femtosecond laser lab.
p147
aVSo this creates pulses of light
p148
aVthat last a femtosecond.
p149
aVThat's really, really, really short.
p150
aVThis is a pulse of light that's
p151
aVonly about one wavelength of light long,
p152
aVso it's a whole bunch of photons
p153
aVall coming and hitting simultaneously.
p154
aVIt creates a very high peak power
p155
aVand it lets you do all kinds of interesting things;
p156
aVin particular, it lets you find hemozoin.
p157
aVSo here's an image of red blood cells,
p158
aVand now we can actually map
p159
aVwhere the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are
p160
aVinside those red blood cells.
p161
aVAnd using both this technique
p162
aVand other optical techniques,
p163
aVwe think we can make those diagnostics.
p164
aVWe also have another hemozoin-oriented
p165
aVtherapy for malaria:
p166
aVa way, in acute cases, to actually
p167
aVtake the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system.
p168
aVSort of like doing dialysis,
p169
aVbut for relieving the parasite load.
p170
aa(lp171
VThis is our thousand-core supercomputer.
p172
aVWe're kind of software guys,
p173
aVand so nearly any problem that you pose,
p174
aVwe like to try to solve with some software.
p175
aVOne of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria
p176
aVor reduce it
p177
aVis you don't know what's the most effective thing to do.
p178
aVOkay, we heard about bed nets earlier.
p179
aVYou spend a certain amount per bed net.
p180
aVOr you could spray.
p181
aVYou can give drug administration.
p182
aVThere's all these different interventions
p183
aVbut they have different kinds of effectiveness.
p184
aVHow can you tell?
p185
aVSo we've created, using our supercomputer,
p186
aVthe world's best computer model of malaria,
p187
aVwhich we'll show you now.
p188
aa(lp189
VWe picked Madagascar.
p190
aVWe have every road,
p191
aVevery village,
p192
aVevery, almost, square inch of Madagascar.
p193
aVWe have all of the precipitation data
p194
aVand the temperature data.
p195
aVThat's very important because the humidity and precipitation
p196
aVtell you whether you've got
p197
aVstanding pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed.
p198
aVSo that sets the stage on which you do this.
p199
aVYou then have to introduce the mosquitoes,
p200
aVand you have to model that
p201
aVand how they come and go.
p202
aVUltimately, it gives you this.
p203
aVThis is malaria spreading
p204
aVacross Madagascar.
p205
aVAnd this is this latter part of the rainy season.
p206
aVWe're going to the dry season now.
p207
aVIt nearly goes away in the dry season,
p208
aVbecause there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.
p209
aVAnd then, of course, the next year it comes roaring back.
p210
aVBy doing these kinds of simulations,
p211
aVwe want to eradicate or control malaria
p212
aVthousands of times in software
p213
aVbefore we actually have to do it in real life;
p214
aVto be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs \u2014
p215
aVhow many bed nets versus how much spraying? \u2014
p216
aVor the social trade-offs \u2014
p217
aVwhat happens if unrest breaks out?
p218
aa(lp219
VWe also try to study our foe.
p220
aVThis is a high-speed camera view
p221
aVof a mosquito.
p222
aVAnd, in a moment,
p223
aVwe're going to see a view of the airflow.
p224
aVHere, we're trying to visualize the airflow
p225
aVaround the wings of the mosquito
p226
aVwith little particles we're illuminating with a laser.
p227
aVBy understanding how mosquitoes fly,
p228
aVwe hope to understand how to make them not fly.
p229
aVNow, one of the ways you can make them not fly
p230
aVis with DDT.
p231
aVThis is a real ad.
p232
aVThis is one of those things you just can't make up.
p233
aVOnce upon a time, this was the primary technique,
p234
aVand, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT.
p235
aVThe United States did.
p236
aVIn 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year
p237
aVof malaria in the United States,
p238
aVbut DDT and a massive public health effort
p239
aVmanaged to squelch it.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo we thought,
p242
aV"Well, we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium,
p243
aVthe parasite involved.
p244
aVWhat can we do to the mosquito?
p245
aVWell, let's try to kill it with consumer electronics."
p246
aVNow, that sounds silly,
p247
aVbut each of these devices
p248
aVhas something interesting in it that maybe you could use.
p249
aVYour Blu-ray player has
p250
aVa very cheap blue laser.
p251
aVYour laser printer has a mirror galvanometer
p252
aVthat's used to steer a laser beam very accurately;
p253
aVthat's what makes those little dots on the page.
p254
aVAnd, of course, there's signal processing
p255
aVand digital cameras.
p256
aVSo what if we could put all that together
p257
aVto shoot them out of the sky with lasers?
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
V(Applause)
p262
aa(lp263
VNow, in our company, this is what we call
p264
aV"the pinky-suck moment."
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VWhat if we could do that?
p269
aVNow, just suspend disbelief for a moment,
p270
aVand let's think of what could happen
p271
aVif we could do that.
p272
aVWell, we could protect very high-value targets like clinics.
p273
aVClinics are full of people that have malaria.
p274
aVThey're sick, and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes.
p275
aVYou really want to protect them.
p276
aVOf course, if you do that,
p277
aVyou could also protect your backyard.
p278
aVAnd farmers could protect their crops
p279
aVthat they want to sell to Whole Foods
p280
aVbecause our photons
p281
aVare 100 percent organic. (Laughter)
p282
aVThey're completely natural.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, it actually gets better than this.
p285
aVYou could, if you're really smart,
p286
aVyou could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug
p287
aVbefore you zap it,
p288
aVand you could listen to the wing beat frequency
p289
aVand you could measure the size.
p290
aVAnd then you could decide:
p291
aV"Is this an insect I want to kill,
p292
aVor an insect I don't want to kill?"
p293
aVMoore's law made computing cheap;
p294
aVso cheap we can weigh
p295
aVthe life of an individual insect
p296
aVand decide thumbs up
p297
aVor thumbs down. (Laughter)
p298
aVNow, it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes.
p299
aVThey're the only ones that are dangerous.
p300
aVMosquitoes only drink blood
p301
aVto lay eggs.
p302
aVMosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition
p303
aVcomes from nectar, from flowers \u2014
p304
aVin fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins \u2014
p305
aVbut the female needs the blood meal.
p306
aVSo, this sounds really crazy, right?
p307
aVWould you like to see it?
p308
aa(lp309
VAudience: Yeah!
p310
aa(lp311
VNathan Myhrvold: Okay, so our legal department prepared a disclaimer,
p312
aVand here it is.
p313
aV(Laughter)
p314
aVNow, after thinking about this a little bit
p315
aVwe thought, you know, it probably would be simpler
p316
aVto do this with a nonlethal laser.
p317
aVSo, Eric Johanson, who built the device,
p318
aVactually, with parts from eBay;
p319
aVand Pablos Holman over here,
p320
aVhe's got mosquitoes in the tank.
p321
aVWe have the device over here.
p322
aVAnd we're going to show you,
p323
aVinstead of the kill laser,
p324
aVwhich will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse,
p325
aVwe're going to have a green laser pointer
p326
aVthat's going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time;
p327
aVotherwise, you can't see it very well.
p328
aVTake it away Eric.
p329
aa(lp330
VEric Johanson: What we have here
p331
aVis a tank on the other side of the stage.
p332
aVAnd we have ... this computer screen
p333
aVcan actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around.
p334
aVAnd Pablos, if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit
p335
aVwe can see them flying around.
p336
aVNow, that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine,
p337
aVand let me show you how it works.
p338
aVHere you can see that the insects are being tracked
p339
aVas they're flying around,
p340
aVwhich is kind of fun.
p341
aVNext we can actually light them up with a laser. (Laughter)
p342
aVNow, this is a low powered laser,
p343
aVand we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency.
p344
aVSo you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around.
p345
aa(lp346
VNM: That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing.
p347
aa(lp348
VEJ: Finally, let's see what this looks like.
p349
aVThere you can see mosquitoes as they fly around, being lit up.
p350
aVThis is slowed way down
p351
aVso that you have an opportunity to see what's happening.
p352
aVHere we have it running at high-speed mode.
p353
aVSo this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate
p354
aVthat it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this,
p355
aVand we're looking very hard at how to make it
p356
aVhighly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Applause)
p359
aa(lp360
VNM: So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that
p361
aVwithout showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em.
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aV(Laughter)
p364
aVThis is very satisfying.
p365
aV(Laughter)
p366
aVThis is one of the first ones we did.
p367
aVThe energy's a little bit high here.
p368
aV(Laughter)
p369
aVWe'll loop around here in just a second, and you'll see another one.
p370
aVHere's another one. Bang.
p371
aVAn interesting thing is, we kill them all the time;
p372
aVwe've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair.
p373
aVThe wing motor is very resilient.
p374
aVI mean, here we're blowing wings off
p375
aVbut the wing motor keeps all the way down.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo, that's what I have. Thanks very much.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Applause)

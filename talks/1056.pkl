VI am honored to be here,
p5
aVand I'm honored to talk about this topic,
p6
aVwhich I think is of grave importance.
p7
aVWe've been talking a lot
p8
aVabout the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species,
p9
aVbut plastic hurts people, too \u2014
p10
aVespecially poor people.
p11
aVAnd both in the production of plastic,
p12
aVthe use of plastic and the disposal of plastic,
p13
aVthe people who have the bull's-eye on their foreheads
p14
aVare poor people.
p15
aVPeople got very upset
p16
aVwhen the BP oil spill happened,
p17
aVfor very good reason.
p18
aVPeople thought, "Oh, my God.
p19
aVThis is terrible, this oil \u2014 it's in the water.
p20
aVIt's going to destroy the living systems there.
p21
aVPeople are going to be hurt.
p22
aVThis is a terrible thing,
p23
aVthis oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf."
p24
aa(lp25
VWhat people don't think about is:
p26
aVWhat if the oil had made it safely to shore?
p27
aVWhat if the oil actually got where it was trying to go?
p28
aVNot only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming,
p29
aVbut there's a place called "Cancer Alley,"
p30
aVand the reason it's called "Cancer Alley"
p31
aVis because the petrochemical industry
p32
aVtakes that oil and turns it into plastic
p33
aVand in the process, kills people.
p34
aVIt shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf.
p35
aVSo oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem when there's a spill;
p36
aVthey're a problem when there's not.
p37
aVAnd what we don't often appreciate
p38
aVis the price that poor people pay
p39
aVfor us to have these disposable products.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe other thing we often don't appreciate is,
p42
aVit's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer.
p43
aVPoor people also suffer at the point of use.
p44
aVThose of us who earn a certain income level,
p45
aVwe have something called choice.
p46
aVThe reason why you want to work hard and have a job
p47
aVand not be poor and broke
p48
aVis so you can have choices, economic choices.
p49
aVWe actually get a chance to choose not to use products
p50
aVthat have dangerous, poisonous plastic in them.
p51
aVOther people who are poor don't have those choices.
p52
aVSo low-income people often are the ones
p53
aVwho are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them
p54
aVthat their children are using.
p55
aVThose are the people who wind up ingesting a disproportionate amount
p56
aVof this poisonous plastic in using it.
p57
aVAnd people say, "Well, they should just buy a different product."
p58
aVWell, the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices.
p59
aVYou often have to buy the cheapest products.
p60
aVThe cheapest products are often the most dangerous.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd if that weren't bad enough \u2014
p63
aVif it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer
p64
aVin places like Cancer Alley,
p65
aVand shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use \u2014
p66
aVat the point of disposal,
p67
aVonce again, it's poor people who bear the burden.
p68
aVOften, we think we're doing a good thing:
p69
aVYou're in your office, drinking your bottled water or whatever it is,
p70
aVand you think to yourself, "I'm going to throw this away.
p71
aVNo \u2014 I'm going to be virtuous. I'm going to put it in the blue bin."
p72
aVYou think, "I put mine in the blue bin."
p73
aVAnd then you look at your colleague and say,
p74
aV"Why, you cretin! You put yours in the white bin."
p75
aVAnd we use that as a moral tickle.
p76
aVWe feel so good about ourselves.
p77
aVIf we \u2014 well, OK, I'm just ... me.
p78
aVNot you, but I feel this way often.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd so we kind of have this moral feel-good moment.
p83
aVBut if we were to be able to follow that little bottle
p84
aVon its journey,
p85
aVwe would be shocked to discover that, all too often,
p86
aVthat bottle is going to be put on a boat,
p87
aVit's going to go all the way across the ocean
p88
aVat some expense,
p89
aVand it's going to wind up in a developing country, often China.
p90
aVI think in our minds, we imagine
p91
aVsomebody's going to take the little bottle and say,
p92
aV"Oh, little bottle! We're so happy to see you, little bottle."
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
V"You've served so well."
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VHe's given a little bottle massage,
p101
aVa little bottle medal.
p102
aVAnd they say, "What would you like to do next?"
p103
aVThe little bottle says, "I just don't know ..."
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VBut that's not actually what happens.
p108
aVYou know?
p109
aVThat bottle winds up getting burned.
p110
aVThe recycling of plastic in many developing countries
p111
aVmeans the incineration of the plastic, the burning of the plastic,
p112
aVwhich releases incredible toxic chemicals
p113
aVand, once again, kills people.
p114
aVAnd so, poor people who are making these products
p115
aVin petrochemical centers like Cancer Alley,
p116
aVpoor people who are consuming these products disproportionately,
p117
aVand then poor people who, even at the tail end of the recycling,
p118
aVare having their lives shortened.
p119
aVThey're all being harmed \u2014 greatly \u2014
p120
aVby this addiction that we have to disposability.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, you think to yourself \u2014 I know how you are \u2014
p123
aVyou say, "That sure is terrible for those poor people.
p124
aVIt's just awful. Those poor people.
p125
aVI hope someone does something to help them."
p126
aVBut what we don't understand is \u2014
p127
aVhere we are in Los Angeles.
p128
aVWe worked very hard to get the smog reduction
p129
aVhappening here in Los Angeles.
p130
aVBut guess what?
p131
aVBecause they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now,
p132
aVbecause the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now,
p133
aValmost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains
p134
aVthat we've achieved here in California
p135
aVhave been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia.
p136
aVSo we all are being hit. We all are being impacted.
p137
aVIt's just that the poor people get it first and worst.
p138
aVBut the dirty production, the burning of toxins,
p139
aVthe lack of environmental standards in Asia,
p140
aVis actually creating so much dirty air pollution,
p141
aVit's coming across the ocean,
p142
aVand has erased our gains here in California.
p143
aVWe're back where we were in the 1970s.
p144
aVAnd so we're on one planet,
p145
aVand we have to be able to get to the root of these problems.
p146
aa(lp147
VThe root of this problem, in my view,
p148
aVis the idea of disposability itself.
p149
aVYou see, if you understand the link
p150
aVbetween what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet
p151
aVand what we're doing to poor people,
p152
aVyou arrive at a very troubling but also very helpful insight:
p153
aVIn order to trash the planet,
p154
aVyou have to trash people.
p155
aVBut if you create a world where you don't trash people,
p156
aVyou can't trash the planet.
p157
aVSo now we are at a moment
p158
aVwhere the coming together of social justice as an idea
p159
aVand ecology as an idea,
p160
aVwe finally can now see
p161
aVthat they are really, at the end of the day, one idea.
p162
aVAnd it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything.
p163
aVWe don't have disposable resources.
p164
aVWe don't have disposable species.
p165
aVAnd we don't have disposable people, either.
p166
aVWe don't have a throwaway planet,
p167
aVand we don't have throwaway children \u2014 it's all precious.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding,
p170
aVnew opportunities for action begin to emerge.
p171
aVBiomimicry,
p172
aVwhich is an emerging science,
p173
aVwinds up being a very important social justice idea.
p174
aVPeople who are just learning about this stuff:
p175
aVbiomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species.
p176
aVDemocracy, by the way,
p177
aVmeans respecting the wisdom of all people \u2014 we'll get to that.
p178
aVBut biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species.
p179
aVIt turns out we're a pretty clever species.
p180
aVWe have this big cortex, we're pretty proud of ourselves.
p181
aVBut if we want to make something hard,
p182
aVwe say, "I know! I'm going to make a hard substance.
p183
aVI know! I'm going to get vacuums and furnaces
p184
aVand drag stuff out of the ground
p185
aVand get things hot and poison and pollute ...
p186
aVBut I got this hard thing!"
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
V"I'm so clever!"
p191
aVAnd you look behind you, and there's destruction all around you.
p192
aVBut guess what?
p193
aVYou're so clever, but you're not as clever as a clam.
p194
aa(lp195
VA clamshell is hard.
p196
aVThere's no vacuums. There's no big furnaces.
p197
aVThere's no poison. There's no pollution.
p198
aVIt turns out that other species figured out a long time ago
p199
aVhow to create many of the things we need
p200
aVusing biological processes that nature knows how to use well.
p201
aVThat insight of biomimicry, of our scientists finally realizing
p202
aVthat we have as much to learn from other species \u2014
p203
aVI don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff.
p204
aVI don't mean looking at it from that way, abusing the little species.
p205
aVI mean actually respecting them, respecting what they've achieved.
p206
aVThat's called biomimicry,
p207
aVand that opens the door to zero waste production;
p208
aVzero pollution production;
p209
aVthat we could actually enjoy
p210
aVa high quality of life, a high standard of living,
p211
aVwithout trashing the planet.
p212
aa(lp213
VWell, that idea of biomimicry,
p214
aVrespecting the wisdom of all species,
p215
aVcombined with the idea of democracy and social justice,
p216
aVrespecting the wisdom and the worth of all people,
p217
aVwould give us a different society.
p218
aVWe would have a different economy.
p219
aVWe would have a green society
p220
aVthat Dr. King would be proud of.
p221
aVThat should be the goal.
p222
aVAnd the way that we get there is to first of all recognize
p223
aVthat the idea of disposability
p224
aVnot only hurts the species we've talked about,
p225
aVbut it even corrupts our own society.
p226
aa(lp227
VWe're so proud to live here in California.
p228
aVWe just had this vote, and everybody's like,
p229
aV"Well \u2014 not in our state!"
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VI don't know what those other states were doing, but ..."
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VJust so proud.
p238
aVAnd, yeah, I'm proud, too.
p239
aVBut ...
p240
aVCalifornia, though we lead the world in some of the green stuff,
p241
aVwe also, unfortunately, lead the world
p242
aVin some of the gulag stuff.
p243
aVCalifornia has one of the highest incarceration rates
p244
aVof all the 50 states.
p245
aVWe have a moral challenge in this movement.
p246
aVWe are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill,
p247
aVbut sometimes not as passionate
p248
aVabout rescuing living beings, living people.
p249
aVAnd I would say that we live in a country \u2014
p250
aVfive percent of the world's population,
p251
aV25 percent of the greenhouse gases,
p252
aVbut also 25 percent of the world's prisoners.
p253
aVOne of every four people locked up anywhere in the world
p254
aVis locked up right here in the United States.
p255
aVSo that is consistent with this idea
p256
aVthat disposability is something we believe in.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd yet,
p259
aVas a movement that has to broaden its constituency,
p260
aVthat has to grow,
p261
aVthat has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone,
p262
aVone of the challenges to the success of this movement,
p263
aVof getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift,
p264
aVis people look at our movement with some suspicion.
p265
aVAnd they ask a question, and the question is:
p266
aVHow can these people be so passionate?
p267
aVA poor person, a low-income person, somebody in Cancer Alley,
p268
aVsomebody in Watts,
p269
aVsomebody in Harlem, somebody on an Indian reservation,
p270
aVmight say to themselves \u2014 and rightfully so \u2014
p271
aV"How can these people be so passionate
p272
aVabout making sure
p273
aVthat a plastic bottle has a second chance in life,
p274
aVor an aluminum can has a second chance,
p275
aVand yet, when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison,
p276
aVhe doesn't get a second chance?"
p277
aV"How can this movement be so passionate about saying
p278
aVwe don't have throwaway stuff, no throwaway dead materials,
p279
aVand yet accept throwaway lives
p280
aVand throwaway communities like Cancer Alley?"
p281
aVAnd so, we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement.
p282
aVWhen we take on topics like this,
p283
aVit gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements
p284
aVand to become more inclusive and to grow,
p285
aVand we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we've been in.
p286
aa(lp287
VMost of you are good, softhearted people.
p288
aVWhen you were younger, you cared about the whole world,
p289
aVand at some point, somebody said you had to pick an issue,
p290
aVyou had to boil your love down to an issue.
p291
aV"Can't love the whole world \u2014
p292
aVyou've got to work on trees or you've got to work on immigration.
p293
aVYou've got to shrink it down and be about one issue."
p294
aVAnd really, they fundamentally told you,
p295
aV"Are you going to hug a tree?
p296
aVOr are you going to hug a child? Pick.
p297
aVAre you going to hug a tree?
p298
aVOr are you going to hug a child? Pick."
p299
aVWell, when you start working on issues like plastic,
p300
aVyou realize the whole thing is connected.
p301
aVAnd luckily, most of us are blessed to have two arms \u2014
p302
aVwe can hug both.
p303
aa(lp304
VThank you very much.

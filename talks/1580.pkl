VOver the past six months, I've spent my time
p5
aVtraveling. I think I've done 60,000 miles,
p6
aVbut without leaving my desk.
p7
aVAnd the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people.
p8
aVI look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here,
p9
aVand at the same time, my alter ego is a big green boxy
p10
aVavatar nicknamed Cyber Frank.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start,
p13
aVif it's possible, with a test, because I do business stuff,
p14
aVso it's important that we focus on outcomes.
p15
aVAnd then I struggled, because I was thinking to myself,
p16
aV"What should I talk? What should I do? It's a TED audience.
p17
aVIt's got to be stretching. How am I going to make \u2014 ?"
p18
aVSo I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right.
p19
aVSo let's just walk our way through this.
p20
aVPlease could you work this through with me? You can shout out the answer if you like.
p21
aVThe question is, which of these horizontal lines is longer?
p22
aVThe answer is?
p23
aVAudience: The same.Eddie Obeng: The same.
p24
aVNo, they're not the same. (Laughter)
p25
aVThey're not the same. The top one is 10 percent longer than the bottom one.
p26
aVSo why did you tell me they were the same? Do you remember when we were kids at school,
p27
aVabout that big, they played the same trick on us?
p28
aVIt was to teach us parallax. Do you remember?
p29
aVAnd you got, you said, "It's the same!" And you got it wrong.
p30
aVYou remember? And you learned the answer, and you've carried this answer in your head for 10, 20, 30, 40 years:
p31
aVThe answer is the same. The answer is the same. So when you're asked what the lengths are,
p32
aVyou say they're the same, but they're not the same, because I've changed it.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the 21st century.
p35
aVSomebody or something has changed the rules
p36
aVabout how our world works.
p37
aVWhen I'm joking, I try and explain it happened at midnight,
p38
aVyou see, while we were asleep, but it was midnight 15 years ago. Okay?
p39
aVYou didn't notice it? But basically, what they do is,
p40
aVthey switched all the rules round, so that the way to
p41
aVsuccessfully run a business, an organization, or even a country,
p42
aVhas been deleted, flipped, and it's a completely new
p43
aV\u2014 you think I'm joking, don't you \u2014 there's a completely new set of rules in operation. (Laughter)
p44
aVDid you notice that? I mean, you missed this one.
p45
aVYou probably \u2014 No, you didn't. Okay. (Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VMy simple idea is that what's happened is,
p48
aVthe real 21st century around us isn't so obvious to us,
p49
aVso instead we spend our time responding rationally
p50
aVto a world which we understand and recognize,
p51
aVbut which no longer exists.
p52
aVYou don't believe me, do you? Okay. (Applause)
p53
aa(lp54
VSo let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand.
p55
aVIf you search Amazon for the word "creativity,"
p56
aVyou'll discover something like 90,000 books.
p57
aVIf you go on Google and you look for "innovation + creativity,"
p58
aVyou get 30 million hits. If you add the word "consultants," it doubles to 60 million. (Laughter)
p59
aVAre you with me? And yet, statistically, what you discover
p60
aVis that about one in 100,000 ideas is found making money
p61
aVor delivering benefits two years after its inception.
p62
aVIt makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executives
p63
aVspend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets
p64
aVwhich are obsolete or need changing before they can be published.
p65
aa(lp66
VHow is that possible? If you look at the visions we have,
p67
aVthe visions of how we're going to change the world,
p68
aVthe key thing is implementation. We have the vision.
p69
aVWe've got to make it happen.
p70
aVWe've spent decades professionalizing implementation.
p71
aVPeople are supposed to be good at making stuff happen.
p72
aVHowever, if I use as an example a family of five
p73
aVgoing on holiday, if you can imagine this,
p74
aVall the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong,
p75
aVwhat I want you to think about is their budget is only 3,000 pounds of expenses.
p76
aVWhat actually happens is, if I compare this to the average
p77
aVreal project, average real successful project,
p78
aVthe family actually end up in Makassar, South Sulawesi,
p79
aVat a cost of 4,000 pounds,
p80
aVwhilst leaving two of the children behind. (Laughter)
p81
aVWhat I'm trying to explain to you is, there are things which don't make sense to us.
p82
aa(lp83
VIt gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one.
p84
aVThis is a quote, and I'll just pick words out of it.
p85
aVIt says \u2014 I'll put on the voice \u2014 "In summary, your Majesty,
p86
aVthe failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity
p87
aVof the crisis was due to the lack of creativity
p88
aVand the number of bright minds," or something like that.
p89
aVThis was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England
p90
aVwhen she asked the question,
p91
aV"Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming?" (Laughter)
p92
aVI'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood. (Laughter)
p93
aVThat's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is,
p94
aVthese are eminent economists, some of the smartest people
p95
aVon the planet. Do you see the challenge? (Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VIt's scary. My friend and mentor, Tim Brown of IDEO,
p98
aVhe explains that design must get big, and he's right.
p99
aVHe wisely explains this to us. He says design thinking
p100
aVmust tackle big systems for the challenges we have.
p101
aVHe's absolutely right.
p102
aVAnd then I ask myself, "Why was it ever small?"
p103
aVIsn't it weird? You know, if collaboration is so cool,
p104
aVis cross-functional working is so amazing,
p105
aVwhy did we build these huge hierarchies? What's going on?
p106
aVYou see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is that
p107
aVwe've not noticed that change I described earlier.
p108
aa(lp109
VWhat we do know is that the world has accelerated.
p110
aVCyberspace moves everything at the speed of light.
p111
aVTechnology accelerates things exponentially.
p112
aVSo if this is now, and that's the past,
p113
aVand we start thinking about change, you know,
p114
aVall governments are seeking change, you're here seeking change,
p115
aVeverybody's after change, it's really cool. (Laughter)
p116
aVSo what happens is, we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change.
p117
aVThe speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing.
p118
aVAt the same time, as we've done that, we've done something really weird.
p119
aVWe've doubled the population in 40 years,
p120
aVput half of them in cities, then connected them all up so they can interact.
p121
aVThe density of the interaction of human beings is amazing.
p122
aVThere are charts which show all these movements of information. That density of information is amazing.
p123
aVAnd then we've done a third thing.
p124
aVyou know, for those of you who have as an office
p125
aVa little desk underneath the stairs, and you say, well this is my little desk under the stairs,
p126
aVno! You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet.
p127
aVWhat's happened is, we've changed the scale.
p128
aVSize and scale are no longer the same.
p129
aVAnd then add to that, every time you tweet,
p130
aVover a third of your followers follow from a country
p131
aVwhich is not your own.
p132
aa(lp133
VGlobal is the new scale. We know that.
p134
aVAnd so people say things like, "The world is now a turbulent place." Have you heard them saying things like that?
p135
aVAnd they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this?
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd they think it's a metaphor, but this is not a metaphor.
p138
aVIt's reality. As a young engineering student, I remember
p139
aVgoing to a demonstration where they basically,
p140
aVthe demonstrator did something quite intriguing.
p141
aVWhat he did was, he got a transparent pipe \u2014 have you seen this demonstration before? \u2014
p142
aVhe attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was,
p143
aVyou had a situation where \u2014 I'll try and draw the tap
p144
aVand the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard.
p145
aVOkay? So I'll write the word "tap." Is that okay? It's a tap. (Laughter)
p146
aVOkay, so he attaches it to a transparent pipe, and he turns the water on.
p147
aVAnd he says, do you notice anything? And the water is whooshing down this pipe.
p148
aVI mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me?
p149
aVSo the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great.
p150
aVAnd he says, "Anything you notice?" No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe,
p151
aVand he connects this to a container, and he fills
p152
aVthe container up with green ink. You with me?
p153
aVSo guess what happens? A thin green line comes out
p154
aVas it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting.
p155
aVAnd then he turns the water up a bit, so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes.
p156
aVSo he's changing the flow of the water, but it's just a boring green line.
p157
aVHe adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.
p158
aVThere's this little flicker, and then as he turns it ever so slightly more,
p159
aVthe whole of that green line disappears, and instead
p160
aVthere are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle.
p161
aVThey're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink
p162
aVso that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone.
p163
aa(lp164
VWhat's happened in this world of pipe
p165
aVis somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent.
p166
aVAll the rules are gone. In that environment, instantly,
p167
aVall the possibilities which turbulence brings are available,
p168
aVand it's not the same as laminar.
p169
aVAnd if we didn't have that green ink, you'd never notice.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd I think this is our challenge, because somebody
p172
aVhas actually increased \u2014 and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff \u2014
p173
aVthe speed, the scale and the density of interaction.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow how do we cope and deal with that?
p176
aVWell, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn.
p177
aVYes, learn, but I know you guys grew up in the days when
p178
aVthere were actually these things called correct answers,
p179
aVbecause of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle,
p180
aVand you believe it will last forever.
p181
aVSo I'll put a little line up here which represents learning,
p182
aVand that's how we used to do it. We could see things,
p183
aVunderstand them, take the time to put them into practice.
p184
aVOut here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace
p185
aVof learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work
p186
aVfor a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work
p187
aVon stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy,
p188
aVand anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings.
p189
aVIf you work in an institution, one day you will get them to make that decision.
p190
aVAnd if you work in a market where people believe in cycles,
p191
aVit's even funnier, because you have to wait all the way
p192
aVfor the cycle to fail before you go, "There's something wrong." You with me?
p193
aVSo it's likely that the line, in terms of learning, is pretty flat.
p194
aVYou with me? This point over here, the point at which
p195
aVthe lines cross over, the pace of change
p196
aVovertakes the pace of learning,
p197
aVand for me, that is what I was describing
p198
aVwhen I was telling you about midnight.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo what does it do to us? Well, it completely transforms what we have to do,
p201
aVmany mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems
p202
aVwithout thinking about the future. If you try and think about it,
p203
aVthe things you're solving now, what problems are they going to bring in the future?
p204
aVIf you haven't understood the world you're living in,
p205
aVit's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you're going to deliver fits.
p206
aa(lp207
VI'll give you an example, a quick one. Creativity and ideas,
p208
aVI mentioned that earlier. All the CEOs around me, my clients, they want innovation,
p209
aVso they seek innovation. They say to people, "Take risks and be creative!"
p210
aVBut unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air.
p211
aVEntering their ears, what they hear is, "Do crazy things and then I'll fire you." Why? (Laughter) Because \u2014
p212
aVWhy? Because in the old world, okay, in the old world,
p213
aVover here, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable.
p214
aVIf you got something wrong, you'd failed. How should you be treated?
p215
aVWell, harshly, because you could have asked somebody who had experience.
p216
aVSo we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for 20, 30 years, are you with me?
p217
aVThe answer is, don't do things which are different.
p218
aVAnd then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work.
p219
aVYou see, in reality, there are two ways you can fail in our new world.
p220
aVOne, you're doing something that you should follow a procedure to, and it's a very difficult thing,
p221
aVyou're sloppy, you get it wrong. How should you be treated? You should probably be fired.
p222
aVOn the other hand, you're doing something new, no one's ever done before,
p223
aVyou get it completely wrong. How should you be treated?
p224
aVWell, free pizzas! You should be treated better than the people who succeed.
p225
aVIt's called smart failure. Why? Because you can't put it on your C.V.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo what I want to leave you, then, is with the explanation
p228
aVof why I actually traveled 60,000 miles from my desk.
p229
aVWhen I realized the power of this new world,
p230
aVI quit my safe teaching job, and set up a virtual business school,
p231
aVthe first in the world, in order to teach people how to make this happen,
p232
aVand I used some of my learnings about some of the rules which I'd learned on myself.
p233
aVIf you're interested, worldaftermidnight.com, you'll find out more,
p234
aVbut I've applied them to myself for over a decade,
p235
aVand I'm still here, and I still have my house, and the most important thing is,
p236
aVI hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives,
p237
aVso that when you go away and you're making your next
p238
aVabsolutely sensible and rational decision, you'll take some time to think,
p239
aV"Hmm, I wonder whether this also makes sense
p240
aVin our new world after midnight." Thank you very much.
p241
aV(Applause)
p242
aVThank you, thank you. (Applause)

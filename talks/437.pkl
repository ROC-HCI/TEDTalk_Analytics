VWhat's happening in genomics,
p5
aVand how this revolution is about to change everything we know
p6
aVabout the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them.
p7
aa(lp8
VIf you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey,
p9
aVand you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith,
p10
aVyou know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation
p11
aVthat we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.
p12
aVIn this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool,
p13
aVusing it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of,
p14
aVrunning around and eating and doing each other
p15
aVfigured out they can make things if they used a tool.
p16
aVAnd that moved us to the next level.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular
p19
aVhave seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology,
p20
aVand technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.
p21
aVAnd we've seen many seminal moments.
p22
aVWe've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s,
p23
aVand who would have thought back then that every single person
p24
aVwould not have just one computer but probably 20,
p25
aVin your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device \u2014
p26
aVin your washing machine, your cell phone.
p27
aVYou're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.
p28
aVThen we go along and create the Internet
p29
aVand connect the world together; we flatten the world.
p30
aa(lp31
VWe've seen so much change, and we've given ourselves these tools now \u2014
p32
aVthese high-powered tools \u2014
p33
aVthat are allowing us to turn the lens inward
p34
aVinto something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome.
p35
aa(lp36
VHow's your genome today? Have you thought about it lately?
p37
aVHeard about it, at least? You probably hear about genomes these days.
p38
aa(lp39
VI thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is.
p40
aVIt's, sort of, like if you ask people,
p41
aVWell, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?
p42
aVPeople never want to say, I really don't understand.
p43
aVSo, I will tell you right off of the bat.
p44
aVYou've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.
p45
aVA genome is really a description for  all of the DNA that is in a living organism.
p46
aVAnd one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.
p47
aVIt doesn't matter whether you're a yeast;
p48
aVit doesn't matter whether you're a mouse;
p49
aVdoesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.
p50
aVThe DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd when Watson and Crick in the '50s
p53
aVfirst decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule \u2014
p54
aVvery long, complicated molecule \u2014
p55
aVwe then started on this journey to understand that
p56
aVinside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits,
p57
aVwhat we inherit, what diseases we may get.
p58
aVWe've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule,
p59
aVthat all of the DNA in your body has been around forever,
p60
aVsince the beginning of us, of us as creatures.
p61
aVThere is a historical archive.
p62
aa(lp63
VLiving in your genome is the history of our species,
p64
aVand you as an individual human being, where you're from,
p65
aVgoing back thousands and thousands and thousands of years,
p66
aVand that's now starting to be understood.
p67
aVBut also, the genome is really the instruction manual.
p68
aVIt is the program. It is the code of life.
p69
aVIt is what makes you function;
p70
aVit is what makes every organism function.
p71
aVDNA is a very elegant molecule.
p72
aVIt's long and it's complicated.
p73
aVReally all you have to know about it is that there's four letters:
p74
aVA, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.
p75
aVAnd with these four letters, you can create a language:
p76
aVa language that can describe anything, and very complicated things.
p77
aVYou know, they are generally put together in pairs,
p78
aVcreating a word or what we call base pairs.
p79
aVAnd you would, you know, when you think about it,
p80
aVfour letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd that may not sound very intuitive,
p83
aVbut let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers.
p84
aVLook at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures
p85
aVand you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.
p86
aVThe language of technology is binary;
p87
aVyou've probably heard that at some point in time.
p88
aVEverything that happens in digital is converted,
p89
aVor a representation, of a one and a zero.
p90
aVSo, when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music,
p91
aVthat's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.
p92
aVWhen you're seeing these pictures, it's all ones and zeros,
p93
aVand when you're talking on your telephone, your cell phone,
p94
aVand it's going over the network,
p95
aVyour voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around.
p96
aVAnd look at all the complex things and wonderful things
p97
aVwe've been able to create with just a one and a zero.
p98
aa(lp99
VWell, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity,
p100
aVa lot of ways to describe mechanisms.
p101
aVSo, let's talk about what that means.
p102
aVSo, if you look at a human genome,
p103
aVthey consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot.
p104
aVAnd they mix up in all different fashions,
p105
aVand that makes you a human being.
p106
aVIf you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing,
p107
aVwe're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.
p108
aVIt's not really all that much data.
p109
aVI will also tell you we're at least as buggy.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VThis here is a bug in my genome
p113
aVthat I have struggled with for a long, long time.
p114
aVWhen you get sick, it is a bug in your genome.
p115
aVIn fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time,
p116
aVlike cancer, we haven't been able to cure
p117
aVbecause we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level.
p118
aVWe are starting to understand that.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo, up to this point we tried to fix it
p121
aVby using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology,
p122
aVwhich means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it,
p123
aVand maybe it's going to make it work.
p124
aVBut if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer?
p125
aVWhat is the code?
p126
aVWhat are the exact instructions that are making it do that?
p127
aVthen you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out.
p128
aVSo, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here's a few factoids for you.
p129
aa(lp130
VWe actually have about 24,000 genes that do things.
p131
aVWe have about a hundred, 120,000 others
p132
aVthat don't appear to function every day,
p133
aVbut represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species
p134
aVgoing back tens of thousands of years.
p135
aVYou might also be interested in knowing
p136
aVthat a mouse has about the same amount of genes.
p137
aa(lp138
VThey recently sequenced Pinot Noir, and it also has about 30,000 genes,
p139
aVso the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity
p140
aVor the evolutionary order of any particular species.
p141
aVNow, look around: just look next to your neighbor,
p142
aVlook forward, look backward. We all look pretty different.
p143
aVA lot of very handsome and pretty people here, skinny, chubby,
p144
aVdifferent races, cultures. We are all 99.9% genetically equal.
p145
aVIt is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material
p146
aVthat makes the difference between any one of us.
p147
aVThat's a tiny amount of material,
p148
aVbut the way that ultimately expresses itself
p149
aVis what makes changes in humans and in all species.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo, we are now able to read genomes.
p152
aVThe first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.
p153
aVIt was done by Dr. Craig Venter.
p154
aVAnd then James Watson's \u2014 one of the co-founders of DNA \u2014
p155
aVgenome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months.
p156
aVAnd if you think about the computer industry
p157
aVand how we've gone from big computers to little ones
p158
aVand how they get more powerful and faster all the time,
p159
aVthe same thing is happening with gene sequencing now:
p160
aVwe are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes
p161
aVfor about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour;
p162
aVyou will see that happen in the next five years.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd what that means is, you are going to walk around
p165
aVwith your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here.
p166
aVAnd when you buy medicine,
p167
aVyou won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody.
p168
aVYou will give your genome to the pharmacist,
p169
aVand your drug will be made for you
p170
aVand it will work much better than the ones that were \u2014
p171
aVyou won't have side effects.
p172
aVAll those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know,
p173
aVwhatever they say in those commercials: forget about that.
p174
aVThey're going to make all that stuff go away.
p175
aa(lp176
VWhat does a genome look like?
p177
aVWell, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.
p178
aVIf you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this,
p179
aVbut what scientists are doing now is
p180
aVthey're understanding what these do and what they mean.
p181
aVBecause what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.
p182
aVIn other words, the first couple of sentences here,
p183
aVassuming this is a grape plant:
p184
aVmake a root, make a branch, create a blossom.
p185
aVIn a human being, down in here it could be:
p186
aVmake blood cells, start cancer.
p187
aVFor me it may be: every calorie you consume, you conserve,
p188
aVbecause I come from a very cold climate.
p189
aVFor my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight.
p190
aVIt's all hidden in this code,
p191
aVand it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them,
p194
aVnow that we're starting to have the book of life?
p195
aVWell, there's many things. Some are exciting.
p196
aVSome people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things
p197
aVthat will probably make you want to projectile puke on me, but that's okay.
p198
aVSo, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms.
p199
aa(lp200
VYou can do a very simple test: scrape your cheek; send it off.
p201
aVYou can find out where your relatives come from;
p202
aVyou can do your genealogy going back thousands of years.
p203
aVWe can understand functionality. This is really important.
p204
aVWe can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries,
p205
aVwhat creates the starchiness inside of a grain,
p206
aVwhy does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide.
p207
aVWe can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems,
p208
aVwhat creates disease, and how we may be able to fix them.
p209
aVBecause we can understand this,
p210
aVwe can fix them, make better organisms.
p211
aa(lp212
VMost importantly, what we're learning
p213
aVis that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox.
p214
aVThe toolbox exists.
p215
aVAn architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox,
p216
aVand we now have the ability to use it.
p217
aVWe are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them.
p218
aa(lp219
VThis company, Synthetic Genomics, I'm involved with,
p220
aVcreated the first full synthetic genome for a little bug,
p221
aVa very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium.
p222
aVIf you have a UTI, you've probably \u2014 or ever had a UTI \u2014
p223
aVyou've come in contact with this little bug.
p224
aVVery simple \u2014 only has about 246 genes \u2014
p225
aVbut we were able to completely synthesize that genome.
p226
aVNow, you have the genome and you say to yourself,
p227
aVSo, if I plug this synthetic genome \u2014 if I pull the old one out and plug it in \u2014
p228
aVdoes it just boot up and live?
p229
aVWell, guess what. It does.
p230
aa(lp231
VNot only does it do that; if you took the genome \u2014 that synthetic genome \u2014
p232
aVand you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast,
p233
aVyou now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma.
p234
aVIt's, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.
p235
aVWell, actually, you could do it the other way.
p236
aVSo, you know, by being able to write a genome
p237
aVand plug it into an organism,
p238
aVthe software, if you will, changes the hardware.
p239
aVAnd this is extremely profound.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo, last year the French and Italians announced
p242
aVthey got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir.
p243
aVThe genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism,
p244
aVand they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.
p245
aVThey have discovered pathways that create flavors,
p246
aValthough it's very important to understand
p247
aVthat those compounds that it's cranking out
p248
aVhave to match a receptor in our genome, in our tongue,
p249
aVfor us to understand and interpret those flavors.
p250
aa(lp251
VThey've also discovered that
p252
aVthere's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well.
p253
aVThey've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.
p254
aVThey now are understanding, and the work is going on,
p255
aVexactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know,
p256
aVto read that entire code and understand how it ticks.
p257
aVSo, then what do you do?
p258
aVKnowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it,
p259
aVmaybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?
p260
aVWell, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VWe can build a better vine.
p264
aVBy the way, just so you know:
p265
aVyou get stressed out about genetically modified organisms;
p266
aVthere is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere
p267
aVthat is not genetically modified.
p268
aVThey're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock;
p269
aVthey would not exist in nature on their own.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo, don't worry about, don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever.
p272
aVSo, we could, you know, focus on disease resistance;
p273
aVwe can go for higher yields without necessarily having
p274
aVdramatic farming techniques to do it, or costs.
p275
aVWe could conceivably expand the climate window:
p276
aVwe could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island, God forbid.
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VWe could produce better flavors and aromas.
p280
aVYou want a little more raspberry, a little more chocolate here or there?
p281
aVAll of these things could conceivably be done,
p282
aVand I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done.
p283
aVBut there's an ecosystem here.
p284
aVIn other words, we're not, sort of, unique little organisms running around;
p285
aVwe are part of a big ecosystem.
p286
aa(lp287
VIn fact \u2014 I'm sorry to inform you \u2014
p288
aVthat inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes
p289
aVwhich you're circulating through your body quite a bit.
p290
aVOur ocean's teaming with microbes;
p291
aVin fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean,
p292
aVin the first three months tripled the known species on the planet
p293
aVby discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.
p294
aVWe now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate
p295
aVand regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do,
p296
aVwhich we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere.
p297
aa(lp298
VWe find microbial life in every part of the planet:
p299
aVin ice, in coal, in rocks, in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing.
p300
aVBut we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants,
p301
aVas much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes,
p302
aVit is the ecosystem around them,
p303
aVit is the microbes that live in their root systems,
p304
aVthat have just as much impact on the character of those plants
p305
aVas the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves.
p306
aa(lp307
VIf you take a closer look at a root system,
p308
aVyou will find there are many, many, many diverse microbial colonies.
p309
aVThis is not big news to viticulturists;
p310
aVthey have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization.
p311
aVAnd, again, this is, sort of, my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology:
p312
aVyou know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in.
p313
aVYou don't necessarily know with granularity
p314
aVexactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics.
p315
aVWe can start to figure that out.
p316
aVWe all talk about terroir; we worship terroir;
p317
aVwe say, Wow, is my terroir great! It's so special.
p318
aVI've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe.
p319
aa(lp320
VWell, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it \u2014
p321
aVwe say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what?
p322
aVWe can figure out what the heck terroir is.
p323
aVIt's in there, waiting to be sequenced.
p324
aVThere are thousands of microbes there.
p325
aVThey're easy to sequence: unlike a human,
p326
aVthey, you know, have a thousand, two thousand genes;
p327
aVwe can figure out what they are.
p328
aa(lp329
VAll we have to do is go around and sample, dig into the ground, find those bugs,
p330
aVsequence them, correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like \u2014
p331
aVthat's just a big database \u2014 and then fertilize.
p332
aVAnd then we understand what is terroir.
p333
aVSo, some people will say, Oh, my God, are we playing God?
p334
aVAre we now, if we engineer organisms, are we playing God?
p335
aVAnd, you know, people would always ask James Watson \u2014
p336
aVhe's not always the most politically correct guy ...
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aV... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?"
p339
aVAnd he had the best answer I ever heard to this question:
p340
aV"Well, somebody has to."
p341
aV(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VI consider myself a very spiritual person,
p344
aVand without, you know, the organized religion part,
p345
aVand I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural.
p346
aVI don't believe that chemicals are unnatural.
p347
aVI told you I'm going to make some of you puke.
p348
aVIt's very simple: we don't invent molecules, compounds.
p349
aVThey're here. They're in the universe.
p350
aVWe reorganize things, we change them around,
p351
aVbut we don't make anything unnatural.
p352
aa(lp353
VNow, we can create bad impacts \u2014
p354
aVwe can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth \u2014
p355
aVbut that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made.
p356
aVSo, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox,
p357
aVand we find that this toolbox is very extensive.
p358
aVThere are microbes out there that actually make gasoline, believe it or not.
p359
aVThere are microbes, you know \u2014 go back to yeast.
p360
aVThese are chemical factories;
p361
aVthe most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature,
p362
aVand we now can use those.
p363
aVThere also is a set of rules.
p364
aa(lp365
VNature will not allow you to \u2014
p366
aVwe could engineer a grape plant, but guess what.
p367
aVWe can't make the grape plant produce babies.
p368
aVNature has put a set of rules out there.
p369
aVWe can work within the rules; we can't break the rules;
p370
aVwe're just learning what the rules are.
p371
aVI just ask the question, if you could cure all disease \u2014
p372
aVif you could make disease go away,
p373
aVbecause we understand how it actually works,
p374
aVif we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants
p375
aVthat grow in very hard-to-grow environments,
p376
aVif we could create clean and plentiful energy \u2014
p377
aVwe, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics,
p378
aVhave single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide
p379
aVand producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.
p380
aVSo, carbon dioxide \u2014 the stuff we want to get rid of \u2014 not sugar, not anything.
p381
aVCarbon dioxide, a little bit of sunlight,
p382
aVyou end up with a lipid that is highly refined.
p383
aVWe could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2,;
p384
aVwe could clean up our oceans; we could make better wine.
p385
aVIf we could, would we?
p386
aVWell, you know, I think the answer is very simple:
p387
aVworking with Nature, working with this tool set that we now understand,
p388
aVis the next step in humankind's evolution.
p389
aa(lp390
VAnd all I can tell you is, stay healthy for 20 years.
p391
aVIf you can stay healthy for 20 years, you'll see 150, maybe 300.
p392
aa(lp393
VThank you.

VIt's wonderful to be here
p5
aVto talk about my journey,
p6
aVto talk about the wheelchair
p7
aVand the freedom it has bought me.
p8
aa(lp9
VI started using a wheelchair 16 years ago
p10
aVwhen an extended illness
p11
aVchanged the way I could access the world.
p12
aVWhen I started using the wheelchair,
p13
aVit was a tremendous new freedom.
p14
aVI'd seen my life slip away and become restricted.
p15
aVIt was like having an enormous new toy.
p16
aVI could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again.
p17
aVJust being out on the street was exhilarating.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut even though I had this newfound joy and freedom,
p20
aVpeople's reaction completely changed towards me.
p21
aVIt was as if they couldn't see me anymore,
p22
aVas if an invisibility cloak had descended.
p23
aVThey seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions
p24
aVof what it must be like to be in a wheelchair.
p25
aVWhen I asked people their associations with the wheelchair,
p26
aVthey used words like "limitation," "fear,"
p27
aV"pity" and "restriction."
p28
aVI realized I'd internalized these responses
p29
aVand it had changed who I was on a core level.
p30
aVA part of me had become alienated from myself.
p31
aVI was seeing myself not from my perspective,
p32
aVbut vividly and continuously from the perspective
p33
aVof other people's responses to me.
p34
aa(lp35
VAs a result, I knew I needed to make my own stories
p36
aVabout this experience,
p37
aVnew narratives to reclaim my identity.
p38
aa(lp39
V["Finding Freedom: 'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.' \u2014 Davis 2009, TEDx Women"]
p40
aa(lp41
VI started making work
p42
aVthat aimed to communicate something
p43
aVof the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair \u2014
p44
aVa power chair \u2014 to negotiate the world.
p45
aVI was working to transform these internalized responses,
p46
aVto transform the preconceptions that had so shaped
p47
aVmy identity when I started using a wheelchair,
p48
aVby creating unexpected images.
p49
aVThe wheelchair became an object to paint and play with.
p50
aVWhen I literally started leaving
p51
aVtraces of my joy and freedom,
p52
aVit was exciting to see
p53
aVthe interested and surprised responses from people.
p54
aVIt seemed to open up new perspectives,
p55
aVand therein lay the paradigm shift.
p56
aVIt showed that an arts practice
p57
aVcan remake one's identity
p58
aVand transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo when I began to dive, in 2005,
p61
aVI realized scuba gear extends your range of activity
p62
aVin just the same way as a wheelchair does,
p63
aVbut the associations attached to scuba gear
p64
aVare ones of excitement and adventure,
p65
aVcompletely different to people's responses to the wheelchair.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo I thought, "I wonder what'll happen
p68
aVif I put the two together?" (Laughter) (Applause)
p69
aVAnd the underwater wheelchair that has resulted
p70
aVhas taken me on the most amazing journey
p71
aVover the last seven years.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo to give you an idea of what that's like,
p74
aVI'd like to share with you one of the outcomes
p75
aVfrom creating this spectacle,
p76
aVand show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Music)
p79
aa(lp80
V(Applause)
p81
aa(lp82
VIt is the most amazing experience,
p83
aVbeyond most other things I've experienced in life.
p84
aVI literally have the freedom to move
p85
aVin 360 degrees of space
p86
aVand an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd the incredibly unexpected thing
p89
aVis that other people seem to see and feel that too.
p90
aVTheir eyes literally light up,
p91
aVand they say things like, "I want one of those,"
p92
aVor, "If you can do that, I can do anything."
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd I'm thinking, it's because in that moment
p95
aVof them seeing an object
p96
aVthey have no frame of reference for,
p97
aVor so transcends the frames of reference
p98
aVthey have with the wheelchair,
p99
aVthey have to think in a completely new way.
p100
aVAnd I think that moment of completely new thought
p101
aVperhaps creates a freedom
p102
aVthat spreads to the rest of other people's lives.
p103
aVFor me, this means that they're seeing
p104
aVthe value of difference,
p105
aVthe joy it brings
p106
aVwhen instead of focusing on loss or limitation,
p107
aVwe see and discover the power and joy
p108
aVof seeing the world from exciting new perspectives.
p109
aVFor me, the wheelchair becomes
p110
aVa vehicle for transformation.
p111
aVIn fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair "Portal,"
p112
aVbecause it's literally pushed me through
p113
aVinto a new way of being,
p114
aVinto new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd the other thing is,
p117
aVthat because nobody's seen or heard
p118
aVof an underwater wheelchair before,
p119
aVand creating this spectacle is about creating
p120
aVnew ways of seeing, being and knowing,
p121
aVnow you have this concept in your mind.
p122
aVYou're all part of the artwork too.

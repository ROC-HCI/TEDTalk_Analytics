VSo, I have an overlooked but potentially lucrative
p5
aVinvestment opportunity for you.
p6
aVOver the past 10 years in the UK,
p7
aVthe return on burial plots has outperformed the UK property market
p8
aVby a ratio of around three to one.
p9
aVThere are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors,
p10
aVand they start at around 3,900 pounds.
p11
aVAnd they're projected to achieve about 40 percent growth.
p12
aVThe biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, this is a real proposition,
p15
aVand there are companies out there that really are offering this investment,
p16
aVbut my interest in it is quite different.
p17
aVI'm an architect and urban designer,
p18
aVand for the past year and a half,
p19
aVI've been looking at approaches to death and dying
p20
aVand at how they've shaped our cities and the buildings within them.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo in the summer, I did my first exhibition
p23
aVon death and architecture in Venice,
p24
aVand it was called "Death in Venice."
p25
aVAnd because death is a subject
p26
aVthat many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about,
p27
aVthe exhibition was designed to be quite playful,
p28
aVso that people would literally engage with it.
p29
aVSo one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London
p30
aVwhich showed just how much of the real estate in the city
p31
aVis given over to death.
p32
aVAs you wave your hand across the map,
p33
aVthe name of the piece of real estate \u2014 the building or the cemetery \u2014
p34
aVis revealed.
p35
aVAnd those white shapes that you can see,
p36
aVthey're all of the hospitals and hospices
p37
aVand mortuaries and cemeteries in the city.
p38
aVIn fact, the majority are cemeteries.
p39
aVWe wanted to show that, even though death and burial are things
p40
aVthat we might not think about,
p41
aVthey're all around us, and they're important parts of our cities.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo about half a million people die in the UK each year,
p44
aVand of those, around a quarter will want to be buried.
p45
aVBut the UK, like many Western European countries,
p46
aVis running out of burial space,
p47
aVespecially in the major cities.
p48
aVAnd the Greater London Authority has been aware of this for a while,
p49
aVand the main causes are population growth,
p50
aVthe fact that existing cemeteries are almost full.
p51
aVThere's a custom in the UK that graves are considered to be occupied forever,
p52
aVand there's also development pressure \u2014 people want to use that same land
p53
aVto build houses or offices or shops.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo they came up with a few solutions.
p56
aVThey were like, well, maybe we can reuse those graves after 50 years.
p57
aVOr maybe we can bury people, like, four deep,
p58
aVso that four people can be buried in the same plot,
p59
aVand we can make more efficient use of the land that way,
p60
aVand in that way, hopefully London will still have space to bury people
p61
aVin the near future.
p62
aa(lp63
VBut, traditionally, cemeteries haven't been taken care of
p64
aVby the local authority.
p65
aVIn fact, the surprising thing is that there's no legal obligation
p66
aVon anyone in the UK to provide burial space.
p67
aVTraditionally, it's been done by private and religious organizations,
p68
aVlike churches and mosques and synagogues.
p69
aVBut there's also occasionally been a for-profit group
p70
aVwho has wanted to get in on the act.
p71
aVAnd, you know, they look at the small size of a burial plot
p72
aVand that high cost,
p73
aVand it looks like there's serious money to be made.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo, actually, if you want to go out and start your own cemetery,
p76
aVyou kind of can.
p77
aVThere was this couple in South Wales,
p78
aVand they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it,
p79
aVand they wanted to develop the land.
p80
aVThey had a load of ideas.
p81
aVThey first thought about making a caravan park,
p82
aVbut the council said no.
p83
aVAnd then they wanted to make a fish farm
p84
aVand again the council said no.
p85
aVThen they hit on the idea of making a cemetery
p86
aVand they calculated that by doing this,
p87
aVthey could increase the value of their land
p88
aVfrom about 95,000 pounds to over one million pounds.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries,
p91
aVlike, it's kind of ludicrous, right?
p92
aVThe thing is that the high cost of those burial plots
p93
aVis actually very misleading.
p94
aVThey look like they're expensive,
p95
aVbut that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot \u2014
p96
aVlike, someone has to cut the grass for the next 50 years.
p97
aVThat means it's very difficult to make money from cemeteries.
p98
aVAnd it's the reason that normally they're run by the council
p99
aVor by a not-for-profit group.
p100
aVBut anyway, the council granted these people permission,
p101
aVand they're now trying to build their cemetery.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo just to explain to you kind of how this works:
p104
aVIf I want to build something in the UK,
p105
aVlike a cemetery for example,
p106
aVthen I have to apply for planning permission first.
p107
aVSo if I want to build a new office building for a client
p108
aVor if I want to extend my home
p109
aVor, you know, if I have a shop and I want to convert it into an office,
p110
aVI have to do a load of drawings,
p111
aVand I submit them to the council for permission.
p112
aVAnd they'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings.
p113
aVSo they'll look at what it looks like.
p114
aVBut they'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have
p115
aVon the local environment?
p116
aVAnd they'll be thinking about things like,
p117
aVis this thing going to cause pollution
p118
aVor is there going to be a lot of traffic
p119
aVthat wants to go to this thing that I've built?
p120
aVBut also good things.
p121
aVIs it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood
p122
aVthat local people would like to use?
p123
aVAnd they'll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages
p124
aVand they'll make a decision.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo that's how it works if I want to build a large cemetery.
p127
aVBut what if I've got a piece of land
p128
aVand I just want to bury a few people, like five or six?
p129
aVWell, then \u2014 actually, I don't need permission from anyone!
p130
aVThere's actually almost no regulation in the UK around burial,
p131
aVand the little bit that there is, is about not polluting water courses,
p132
aVlike not polluting rivers or groundwater.
p133
aVSo actually, if you want to go and make your own mini-cemetery,
p134
aVthen you can.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut I mean, like \u2014 really, who does this? Right?
p137
aVWell, if you're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate,
p138
aVthen there's a chance that you'll have a mausoleum on it,
p139
aVand you'll bury your family there.
p140
aVBut the really weird thing
p141
aVis that you don't need to have a piece of land of a certain size
p142
aVbefore you're allowed to start burying people on it.
p143
aVAnd so that means that, technically,
p144
aVthis applies to, like, the back garden of your house in the suburbs.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VSo what if you wanted to try this yourself at home?
p149
aVWell, there's a few councils that have guidance on their website
p150
aVwhich can help you.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo, the first thing that they tell you
p153
aVis that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead \u2014
p154
aVyou're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VThey also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is.
p159
aVBut that's pretty much it for formal requirements.
p160
aVNow, they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this,
p161
aVbut, legally speaking, there's almost nothing that they can do about it.
p162
aVAnd just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind
p163
aVabout how much those burial plots cost
p164
aVand how much money you might be able to make,
p165
aVthey also warn that it might cause the value of your house
p166
aVto drop by 20 percent.
p167
aVAlthough, actually, it's more likely
p168
aVthat no one will want to buy your house at all after that.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo what I find fascinating about this
p171
aVis the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death.
p172
aVIn the UK, and I think that the figures across Europe are probably similar,
p173
aVonly about 30 percent of people have ever talked to anyone
p174
aVabout their wishes around death,
p175
aVand even for people over 75,
p176
aVonly 45 percent of people have ever talked about this.
p177
aVAnd the reasons that people give ... you know,
p178
aVthey think that their death is far off
p179
aVor they think that they're going to make people uncomfortable
p180
aVby talking about it.
p181
aVAnd you know, to a certain extent,
p182
aVthere are other people out there who are taking care of things for us.
p183
aVThe government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things
p184
aVlike burying a death, for example,
p185
aVand there's people like funeral directors
p186
aVwho devote their entire working lives to this issue.
p187
aVBut when it comes to our cities
p188
aVand thinking about how death fits in our cities,
p189
aVthere's much less regulation and design and thought
p190
aVthan we might imagine.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo we're not thinking about this,
p193
aVbut all of the people we imagine are thinking about it \u2014
p194
aVthey're not taking care of it either.
p195
aa(lp196
VThank you.

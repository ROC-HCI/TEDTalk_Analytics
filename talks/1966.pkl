VWhen people think about cities,
p5
aVthey tend to think of certain things.
p6
aVThey think of buildings and streets
p7
aVand skyscrapers, noisy cabs.
p8
aVBut when I think about cities,
p9
aVI think about people.
p10
aVCities are fundamentally about people,
p11
aVand where people go
p12
aVand where people meet
p13
aVare at the core of what makes a city work.
p14
aVSo even more important than buildings in a city
p15
aVare the public spaces in between them.
p16
aVAnd today, some of the most transformative
p17
aVchanges in cities
p18
aVare happening in these public spaces.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo I believe that lively, enjoyable public spaces
p21
aVare the key to planning a great city.
p22
aVThey are what makes it come alive.
p23
aVBut what makes a public space work?
p24
aVWhat attracts people to successful public spaces,
p25
aVand what is it about unsuccessful places
p26
aVthat keeps people away?
p27
aVI thought, if I could answer those questions,
p28
aVI could make a huge contribution to my city.
p29
aVBut one of the more wonky things about me
p30
aVis that I am an animal behaviorist,
p31
aVand I use those skills not to study animal behavior
p32
aVbut to study how people in cities
p33
aVuse city public spaces.
p34
aa(lp35
VOne of the first spaces that I studied
p36
aVwas this little vest pocket park called Paley Park
p37
aVin midtown Manhattan.
p38
aVThis little space became a small phenomenon,
p39
aVand because it had such a profound impact
p40
aVon New Yorkers,
p41
aVit made an enormous impression on me.
p42
aVI studied this park very early on in my career
p43
aVbecause it happened to have been built
p44
aVby my stepfather,
p45
aVso I knew that places like Paley Park
p46
aVdidn't happen by accident.
p47
aVI saw firsthand that they required
p48
aVincredible dedication
p49
aVand enormous attention to detail.
p50
aVBut what was it about this space
p51
aVthat made it special and drew people to it?
p52
aVWell, I would sit in the park and watch very carefully,
p53
aVand first among other things
p54
aVwere the comfortable, movable chairs.
p55
aVPeople would come in, find their own seat,
p56
aVmove it a bit, actually, and then stay a while,
p57
aVand then interestingly,
p58
aVpeople themselves attracted other people,
p59
aVand ironically, I felt more peaceful
p60
aVif there were other people around.
p61
aVAnd it was green.
p62
aVThis little park provided what New Yorkers crave:
p63
aVcomfort and greenery.
p64
aVBut my question was,
p65
aVwhy weren't there more places with greenery
p66
aVand places to sit in the middle of the city
p67
aVwhere you didn't feel alone,
p68
aVor like a trespasser?
p69
aVUnfortunately, that's not how cities
p70
aVwere being designed.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo here you see a familiar sight.
p73
aVThis is how plazas have been designed for generations.
p74
aVThey have that stylish, Spartan look
p75
aVthat we often associate with modern architecture,
p76
aVbut it's not surprising that people
p77
aVavoid spaces like this.
p78
aVThey not only look desolate,
p79
aVthey feel downright dangerous.
p80
aVI mean, where would you sit here?
p81
aVWhat would you do here?
p82
aVBut architects love them.
p83
aVThey are plinths for their creations.
p84
aVThey might tolerate a sculpture or two,
p85
aVbut that's about it.
p86
aVAnd for developers, they are ideal.
p87
aVThere's nothing to water, nothing to maintain,
p88
aVand no undesirable people to worry about.
p89
aVBut don't you think this is a waste?
p90
aVFor me, becoming a city planner
p91
aVmeant being able to truly change the city
p92
aVthat I lived in and loved.
p93
aVI wanted to be able to create places
p94
aVthat would give you the feeling that you got
p95
aVin Paley Park,
p96
aVand not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this.
p97
aVBut over the many years,
p98
aVI have learned how hard it is
p99
aVto create successful, meaningful,
p100
aVenjoyable public spaces.
p101
aVAs I learned from my stepfather,
p102
aVthey certainly do not happen by accident,
p103
aVespecially in a city like New York,
p104
aVwhere public space has to be fought for to begin with,
p105
aVand then for them to be successful,
p106
aVsomebody has to think very hard
p107
aVabout every detail.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow, open spaces in cities are opportunities.
p110
aVYes, they are opportunities for commercial investment,
p111
aVbut they are also opportunities for the common good
p112
aVof the city,
p113
aVand those two goals are often not aligned with one another,
p114
aVand therein lies the conflict.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe first opportunity I had to fight
p117
aVfor a great public open space was in the early 1980s,
p118
aVwhen I was leading a team of planners
p119
aVat a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City
p120
aVin lower Manhattan on the Hudson River.
p121
aVAnd this sandy wasteland had lain barren
p122
aVfor 10 years,
p123
aVand we were told, unless we found a developer
p124
aVin six months, it would go bankrupt.
p125
aVSo we came up with a radical,
p126
aValmost insane idea.
p127
aVInstead of building a park
p128
aVas a complement to future development,
p129
aVwhy don't we reverse that equation
p130
aVand build a small but very high-quality
p131
aVpublic open space first,
p132
aVand see if that made a difference.
p133
aVSo we only could afford to build a two-block section
p134
aVof what would become a mile-long esplanade,
p135
aVso whatever we built had to be perfect.
p136
aVSo just to make sure, I insisted
p137
aVthat we build a mock-up
p138
aVin wood, at scale, of the railing and the sea wall.
p139
aVAnd when I sat down on that test bench
p140
aVwith sand still swirling all around me,
p141
aVthe railing hit exactly at eye level,
p142
aVblocking my view and ruining my experience
p143
aVat the water's edge.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo you see, details really do make a difference.
p146
aVBut design is not just how something looks,
p147
aVit's how your body feels on that seat in that space,
p148
aVand I believe that successful design always depends
p149
aVon that very individual experience.
p150
aVIn this photo, everything looks very finished,
p151
aVbut that granite edge, those lights,
p152
aVthe back on that bench,
p153
aVthe trees in planting,
p154
aVand the many different kinds of places to sit
p155
aVwere all little battles that turned this project
p156
aVinto a place that people wanted to be.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, this proved very valuable 20 years later
p159
aVwhen Michael Bloomberg asked me to be
p160
aVhis planning commissioner
p161
aVand put me in charge of shaping
p162
aVthe entire city of New York.
p163
aVAnd he said to me on that very day,
p164
aVhe said that New York was projected
p165
aVto grow from eight to nine million people.
p166
aVAnd he asked me,
p167
aV"So where are you going to put
p168
aVone million additional New Yorkers?"
p169
aa(lp170
VWell, I didn't have any idea.
p171
aVNow, you know that New York does
p172
aVplace a high value on attracting immigrants,
p173
aVso we were excited about the prospect of growth,
p174
aVbut honestly, where were we going to grow
p175
aVin a city that was already built out to its edges
p176
aVand surrounded by water?
p177
aVHow were we going to find housing
p178
aVfor that many new New Yorkers?
p179
aVAnd if we couldn't spread out,
p180
aVwhich was probably a good thing,
p181
aVwhere could new housing go?
p182
aVAnd what about cars?
p183
aVOur city couldn't possibly handle any more cars.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo what were we going to do?
p186
aVIf we couldn't spread out, we had to go up.
p187
aVAnd if we had to go up,
p188
aVwe had to go up in places
p189
aVwhere you wouldn't need to own a car.
p190
aVSo that meant using one of our greatest assets:
p191
aVour transit system.
p192
aVBut we had never before thought
p193
aVof how we could make the most of it.
p194
aVSo here was the answer to our puzzle.
p195
aVIf we were to channel and redirect
p196
aVall new development around transit,
p197
aVwe could actually handle that population increase,
p198
aVwe thought.
p199
aVAnd so here was the plan,
p200
aVwhat we really needed to do:
p201
aVWe needed to redo our zoning \u2014
p202
aVand zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool \u2014
p203
aVand basically reshape the entire city,
p204
aVtargeting where new development could go
p205
aVand prohibiting any development at all
p206
aVin our car-oriented,
p207
aVsuburban-style neighborhoods.
p208
aVWell, this was an unbelievably ambitious idea,
p209
aVambitious because communities
p210
aVhad to approve those plans.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo how was I going to get this done?
p213
aVBy listening. So I began listening,
p214
aVin fact, thousands of hours of listening
p215
aVjust to establish trust.
p216
aVYou know, communities can tell
p217
aVwhether or not you understand their neighborhoods.
p218
aVIt's not something you can just fake.
p219
aVAnd so I began walking.
p220
aVI can't tell you how many blocks I walked,
p221
aVin sweltering summers, in freezing winters,
p222
aVyear after year,
p223
aVjust so I could get to understand
p224
aVthe DNA of each neighborhood
p225
aVand know what each street felt like.
p226
aVI became an incredibly geeky zoning expert,
p227
aVfinding ways that zoning could address
p228
aVcommunities' concerns.
p229
aVSo little by little, neighborhood by neighborhood,
p230
aVblock by block,
p231
aVwe began to set height limits
p232
aVso that all new development
p233
aVwould be predictable and near transit.
p234
aVOver the course of 12 years,
p235
aVwe were able to rezone
p236
aV124 neighborhoods,
p237
aV40 percent of the city,
p238
aV12,500 blocks, so that now,
p239
aV90 percent of all new development of New York
p240
aVis within a 10-minute walk of a subway.
p241
aVIn other words, nobody in those new buildings
p242
aVneeds to own a car.
p243
aa(lp244
VWell, those rezonings were exhausting
p245
aVand enervating and important,
p246
aVbut rezoning was never my mission.
p247
aVYou can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning.
p248
aVMy mission was always to create
p249
aVgreat public spaces.
p250
aVSo in the areas where we zoned for significant development,
p251
aVI was determined to create places
p252
aVthat would make a difference in people's lives.
p253
aVHere you see what was
p254
aVtwo miles of abandoned, degraded waterfront
p255
aVin the neighborhoods of Greenpoint
p256
aVand Williamsburg in Brooklyn,
p257
aVimpossible to get to and impossible to use.
p258
aVNow the zoning here was massive,
p259
aVso I felt an obligation to create
p260
aVmagnificent parks on these waterfronts,
p261
aVand I spent an incredible amount of time
p262
aVon every square inch of these plans.
p263
aVI wanted to make sure that there were
p264
aVtree-lined paths from the upland to the water,
p265
aVthat there were trees and plantings everywhere,
p266
aVand, of course, lots and lots of places to sit.
p267
aVHonestly, I had no idea how it would turn out.
p268
aVI had to have faith.
p269
aVBut I put everything that I had studied and learned
p270
aVinto those plans.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd then it opened,
p273
aVand I have to tell you, it was incredible.
p274
aVPeople came from all over the city
p275
aVto be in these parks.
p276
aVI know they changed the lives of the people who live there,
p277
aVbut they also changed New Yorkers' whole image
p278
aVof their city.
p279
aVI often come down and watch people
p280
aVget on this little ferry
p281
aVthat now runs between the boroughs,
p282
aVand I can't tell you why,
p283
aVbut I'm completely moved
p284
aVby the fact that people are using it
p285
aVas if it had always been there.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd here is a new park in lower Manhattan.
p288
aVNow, the water's edge in lower Manhattan
p289
aVwas a complete mess before 9/11.
p290
aVWall Street was essentially landlocked
p291
aVbecause you couldn't get anywhere near this edge.
p292
aVAnd after 9/11, the city had very little control.
p293
aVBut I thought if we went
p294
aVto the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation
p295
aVand got money to reclaim this two miles
p296
aVof degraded waterfront
p297
aVthat it would have an enormous effect
p298
aVon the rebuilding of lower Manhattan.
p299
aVAnd it did.
p300
aVLower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront
p301
aVon all three sides.
p302
aa(lp303
VI really love this park.
p304
aVYou know, railings have to be higher now,
p305
aVso we put bar seating at the edge,
p306
aVand you can get so close to the water
p307
aVyou're practically on it.
p308
aVAnd see how the railing widens
p309
aVand flattens out so you can lay down
p310
aVyour lunch or your laptop.
p311
aVAnd I love when people come there
p312
aVand look up and they say,
p313
aV"Wow, there's Brooklyn, and it's so close."
p314
aa(lp315
VSo what's the trick?
p316
aVHow do you turn a park
p317
aVinto a place that people want to be?
p318
aVWell, it's up to you,
p319
aVnot as a city planner but as a human being.
p320
aVYou don't tap into your design expertise.
p321
aVYou tap into your humanity.
p322
aVI mean, would you want to go there?
p323
aVWould you want to stay there?
p324
aVCan you see into it and out of it?
p325
aVAre there other people there?
p326
aVDoes it seem green and friendly?
p327
aVCan you find your very own seat?
p328
aa(lp329
VWell now, all over New York City,
p330
aVthere are places where you can
p331
aVfind your very own seat.
p332
aVWhere there used to be parking spaces,
p333
aVthere are now pop-up cafes.
p334
aVWhere Broadway traffic used to run,
p335
aVthere are now tables and chairs.
p336
aVWhere 12 years ago, sidewalk cafes were not allowed,
p337
aVthey are now everywhere.
p338
aVBut claiming these spaces for public use
p339
aVwas not simple,
p340
aVand it's even harder to keep them that way.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo now I'm going to tell you a story
p343
aVabout a very unusual park called the High Line.
p344
aVThe High Line was an elevated railway.
p345
aV(Applause)
p346
aVThe High Line was an elevated railway
p347
aVthat ran through three neighborhoods
p348
aVon Manhattan's West Side,
p349
aVand when the train stopped running,
p350
aVit became a self-seeded landscape,
p351
aVa kind of a garden in the sky.
p352
aVAnd when I saw it the first time,
p353
aVhonestly, when I went up on that old viaduct,
p354
aVI fell in love the way you fall in love with a person,
p355
aVhonestly.
p356
aVAnd when I was appointed,
p357
aVsaving the first two sections of the High Line
p358
aVfrom demolition became my first priority
p359
aVand my most important project.
p360
aVI knew if there was a day that I didn't
p361
aVworry about the High Line, it would come down.
p362
aVAnd the High Line,
p363
aVeven though it is widely known now
p364
aVand phenomenally popular,
p365
aVit is the most contested public space in the city.
p366
aVYou might see a beautiful park,
p367
aVbut not everyone does.
p368
aVYou know, it's true, commercial interests
p369
aVwill always battle against public space.
p370
aVYou might say,
p371
aV"How wonderful it is that more than
p372
aVfour million people come from all over the world
p373
aVto visit the High Line."
p374
aVWell, a developer sees just one thing: customers.
p375
aVHey, why not take out those plantings
p376
aVand have shops all along the High Line?
p377
aVWouldn't that be terrific
p378
aVand won't it mean a lot more money for the city?
p379
aVWell no, it would not be terrific.
p380
aVIt would be a mall, and not a park.
p381
aV(Applause)
p382
aVAnd you know what, it might mean
p383
aVmore money for the city,
p384
aVbut a city has to take the long view,
p385
aVthe view for the common good.
p386
aVMost recently, the last section of the High Line,
p387
aVthe third section of the High Line,
p388
aVthe final section of the High Line,
p389
aVhas been pitted against development interests,
p390
aVwhere some of the city's leading developers
p391
aVare building more than 17 million square feet
p392
aVat the Hudson Yards.
p393
aVAnd they came to me and proposed
p394
aVthat they "temporarily disassemble"
p395
aVthat third and final section.
p396
aVPerhaps the High Line didn't fit in
p397
aVwith their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers
p398
aVon a hill.
p399
aVPerhaps it was just in their way.
p400
aVBut in any case, it took nine months
p401
aVof nonstop daily negotiation
p402
aVto finally get the signed agreement
p403
aVto prohibit its demolition,
p404
aVand that was only two years ago.
p405
aa(lp406
VSo you see, no matter how popular
p407
aVand successful a public space may be,
p408
aVit can never be taken for granted.
p409
aVPublic spaces always \u2014 this is it saved \u2014
p410
aVpublic spaces always need vigilant champions,
p411
aVnot only to claim them at the outset for public use,
p412
aVbut to design them for the people that use them,
p413
aVthen to maintain them to ensure
p414
aVthat they are for everyone,
p415
aVthat they are not violated, invaded,
p416
aVabandoned or ignored.
p417
aVIf there is any one lesson
p418
aVthat I have learned in my life as a city planner,
p419
aVit is that public spaces have power.
p420
aVIt's not just the number of people using them,
p421
aVit's the even greater number of people
p422
aVwho feel better about their city
p423
aVjust knowing that they are there.
p424
aVPublic space can change how you live in a city,
p425
aVhow you feel about a city,
p426
aVwhether you choose one city over another,
p427
aVand public space is one of the most important reasons
p428
aVwhy you stay in a city.
p429
aa(lp430
VI believe that a successful city
p431
aVis like a fabulous party.
p432
aVPeople stay because they are having a great time.
p433
aa(lp434
VThank you.
p435
aa(lp436
V(Applause)
p437
aVThank you. (Applause)

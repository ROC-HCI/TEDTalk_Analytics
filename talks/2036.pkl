VI've been thinking a lot about the world recently
p5
aVand how it's changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.
p6
aVTwenty or 30 years ago,
p7
aVif a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died
p8
aVin a remote village in East Asia,
p9
aVit would have been a tragedy for the chicken
p10
aVand its closest relatives,
p11
aVbut I don't think there was much possibility
p12
aVof us fearing a global pandemic
p13
aVand the deaths of millions.
p14
aVTwenty or 30 years ago, if a bank in North America
p15
aVlent too much money to some people
p16
aVwho couldn't afford to pay it back
p17
aVand the bank went bust,
p18
aVthat was bad for the lender
p19
aVand bad for the borrower,
p20
aVbut we didn't imagine it would bring
p21
aVthe global economic system to its knees
p22
aVfor nearly a decade.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis is globalization.
p25
aVThis is the miracle that has enabled us
p26
aVto transship our bodies and our minds
p27
aVand our words and our pictures and our ideas
p28
aVand our teaching and our learning around the planet
p29
aVever faster and ever cheaper.
p30
aVIt's brought a lot of bad stuff,
p31
aVlike the stuff that I just described,
p32
aVbut it's also brought a lot of good stuff.
p33
aVA lot of us are not aware
p34
aVof the extraordinary successes of the Millennium Development Goals,
p35
aVseveral of which have achieved their targets
p36
aVlong before the due date.
p37
aVThat proves that this species of humanity
p38
aVis capable of achieving extraordinary progress
p39
aVif it really acts together and it really tries hard.
p40
aVBut if I had to put it in a nutshell these days,
p41
aVI sort of feel that globalization
p42
aVhas taken us by surprise,
p43
aVand we've been slow to respond to it.
p44
aVIf you look at the downside of globalization,
p45
aVit really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming.
p46
aVAll of the grand challenges that we face today,
p47
aVlike climate change and human rights
p48
aVand demographics and terrorism and pandemics
p49
aVand narco-trafficking and human slavery
p50
aVand species loss, I could go on,
p51
aVwe're not making an awful lot of progress
p52
aVagainst an awful lot of those challenges.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo in a nutshell, that's the challenge
p55
aVthat we all face today
p56
aVat this interesting point in history.
p57
aVThat's clearly what we've got to do next.
p58
aVWe've somehow got to get our act together
p59
aVand we've got to figure out how to globalize
p60
aVthe solutions better
p61
aVso that we don't simply become a species
p62
aVwhich is the victim of the globalization of problems.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhy are we so slow at achieving these advances?
p65
aVWhat's the reason for it?
p66
aVWell, there are, of course, a number of reasons,
p67
aVbut perhaps the primary reason
p68
aVis because we're still organized as a species
p69
aVin the same way that we were organized
p70
aV200 or 300 years ago.
p71
aVThere's one superpower left on the planet
p72
aVand that is the seven billion people,
p73
aVthe seven billion of us who cause all these problems,
p74
aVthe same seven billion, by the way,
p75
aVwho will resolve them all.
p76
aVBut how are those seven billion organized?
p77
aVThey're still organized in 200 or so nation-states,
p78
aVand the nations have governments
p79
aVthat make rules
p80
aVand cause us to behave in certain ways.
p81
aVAnd that's a pretty efficient system,
p82
aVbut the problem is that the way that those laws are made
p83
aVand the way those governments think
p84
aVis absolutely wrong for the solution of global problems,
p85
aVbecause it all looks inwards.
p86
aVThe politicians that we elect
p87
aVand the politicians we don't elect, on the whole,
p88
aVhave minds that microscope.
p89
aVThey don't have minds that telescope.
p90
aVThey look in. They pretend, they behave,
p91
aVas if they believed that every country was an island
p92
aVthat existed quite happily, independently
p93
aVof all the others
p94
aVon its own little planet
p95
aVin its own little solar system.
p96
aVThis is the problem:
p97
aVcountries competing against each other,
p98
aVcountries fighting against each other.
p99
aVThis week, as any week you care to look at,
p100
aVyou'll find people actually trying to kill each other from country to country,
p101
aVbut even when that's not going on,
p102
aVthere's competition between countries,
p103
aVeach one trying to shaft the next.
p104
aa(lp105
VThis is clearly not a good arrangement.
p106
aVWe clearly need to change it.
p107
aVWe clearly need to find ways
p108
aVof encouraging countries to start working together
p109
aVa little bit better.
p110
aVAnd why won't they do that?
p111
aVWhy is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards?
p112
aa(lp113
VWell, the first and most obvious reason
p114
aVis because that's what we ask them to do.
p115
aVThat's what we tell them to do.
p116
aVWhen we elect governments
p117
aVor when we tolerate unelected governments,
p118
aVwe're effectively telling them that what we want
p119
aVis for them to deliver us in our country
p120
aVa certain number of things.
p121
aVWe want them to deliver prosperity,
p122
aVgrowth, competitiveness, transparency, justice
p123
aVand all of those things.
p124
aVSo unless we start asking our governments
p125
aVto think outside a little bit,
p126
aVto consider the global problems that will finish us all
p127
aVif we don't start considering them,
p128
aVthen we can hardly blame them
p129
aVif what they carry on doing is looking inwards,
p130
aVif they still have minds that microscope
p131
aVrather than minds that telescope.
p132
aVThat's the first reason why things tend not to change.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe second reason is that these governments,
p135
aVjust like all the rest of us,
p136
aVare cultural psychopaths.
p137
aVI don't mean to be rude,
p138
aVbut you know what a psychopath is.
p139
aVA psychopath is a person who,
p140
aVunfortunately for him or her,
p141
aVlacks the ability to really empathize
p142
aVwith other human beings.
p143
aVWhen they look around,
p144
aVthey don't see other human beings
p145
aVwith deep, rich, three-dimensional personal lives
p146
aVand aims and ambitions.
p147
aVWhat they see is cardboard cutouts,
p148
aVand it's very sad and it's very lonely,
p149
aVand it's very rare, fortunately.
p150
aa(lp151
VBut actually, aren't most of us
p152
aVnot really so very good at empathy?
p153
aVOh sure, we're very good at empathy
p154
aVwhen it's a question of dealing with people
p155
aVwho kind of look like us
p156
aVand kind of walk and talk and eat and pray
p157
aVand wear like us,
p158
aVbut when it comes to people who don't do that,
p159
aVwho don't quite dress like us
p160
aVand don't quite pray like us
p161
aVand don't quite talk like us,
p162
aVdo we not also have a tendency to see them
p163
aVever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too?
p164
aVAnd this is a question we need to ask ourselves.
p165
aVI think constantly we have to monitor it.
p166
aVAre we and our politicians to a degree
p167
aVcultural psychopaths?
p168
aa(lp169
VThe third reason is hardly worth mentioning
p170
aVbecause it's so silly,
p171
aVbut there's a belief amongst governments
p172
aVthat the domestic agenda
p173
aVand the international agenda
p174
aVare incompatible and always will be.
p175
aVThis is just nonsense.
p176
aVIn my day job, I'm a policy adviser.
p177
aVI've spent the last 15 years or so
p178
aVadvising governments around the world,
p179
aVand in all of that time I have never once seen
p180
aVa single domestic policy issue
p181
aVthat could not be more imaginatively,
p182
aVeffectively and rapidly resolved
p183
aVthan by treating it as an international problem,
p184
aVlooking at the international context,
p185
aVcomparing what others have done,
p186
aVbringing in others, working externally
p187
aVinstead of working internally.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd so you may say, well, given all of that,
p190
aVwhy then doesn't it work?
p191
aVWhy can we not make our politicians change?
p192
aVWhy can't we demand them?
p193
aVWell I, like a lot of us, spend a lot of time complaining
p194
aVabout how hard it is to make people change,
p195
aVand I don't think we should fuss about it.
p196
aVI think we should just accept
p197
aVthat we are an inherently conservative species.
p198
aVWe don't like to change.
p199
aVIt exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons.
p200
aVWe probably wouldn't still be here today
p201
aVif we weren't so resistant to change.
p202
aVIt's very simple: Many thousands of years ago,
p203
aVwe discovered that if we carried on
p204
aVdoing the same things, we wouldn't die,
p205
aVbecause the things that we've done before
p206
aVby definition didn't kill us,
p207
aVand therefore as long as we carry on doing them,
p208
aVwe'll be okay,
p209
aVand it's very sensible not to do anything new,
p210
aVbecause it might kill you.
p211
aVBut of course, there are exceptions to that.
p212
aVOtherwise, we'd never get anywhere.
p213
aVAnd one of the exceptions, the interesting exception,
p214
aVis when you can show to people
p215
aVthat there might be some self-interest
p216
aVin them making that leap of faith
p217
aVand changing a little bit.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo I've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years
p220
aVtrying to find out what could be that self-interest
p221
aVthat would encourage not just politicians
p222
aVbut also businesses and general populations,
p223
aVall of us, to start to think a little more outwardly,
p224
aVto think in a bigger picture,
p225
aVnot always to look inwards, sometimes to look outwards.
p226
aVAnd this is where I discovered
p227
aVsomething quite important.
p228
aVIn 2005, I launched a study
p229
aVcalled the Nation Brands Index.
p230
aVWhat it is, it's a very large-scale study that polls
p231
aVa very large sample of the world's population,
p232
aVa sample that represents about 70 percent
p233
aVof the planet's population,
p234
aVand I started asking them a series of questions
p235
aVabout how they perceive other countries.
p236
aVAnd the Nation Brands Index over the years
p237
aVhas grown to be a very, very large database.
p238
aVIt's about 200 billion data points
p239
aVtracking what ordinary people think about other countries
p240
aVand why.
p241
aVWhy did I do this? Well, because the governments that I advise
p242
aVare very, very keen on knowing
p243
aVhow they are regarded.
p244
aVThey've known, partly because
p245
aVI've encouraged them to realize it,
p246
aVthat countries depend
p247
aVenormously on their reputations
p248
aVin order to survive and prosper in the world.
p249
aVIf a country has a great, positive image,
p250
aVlike Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland,
p251
aVeverything is easy and everything is cheap.
p252
aVYou get more tourists. You get more investors.
p253
aVYou sell your products more expensively.
p254
aVIf, on the other hand, you have a country
p255
aVwith a very weak or a very negative image,
p256
aVeverything is difficult and everything is expensive.
p257
aVSo governments care desperately
p258
aVabout the image of their country,
p259
aVbecause it makes a direct difference
p260
aVto how much money they can make,
p261
aVand that's what they've promised their populations
p262
aVthey're going to deliver.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo a couple of years ago, I thought I would take
p265
aVsome time out and speak to that gigantic database
p266
aVand ask it,
p267
aVwhy do some people prefer one country
p268
aVmore than another?
p269
aVAnd the answer that the database gave me
p270
aVcompletely staggered me.
p271
aVIt was 6.8.
p272
aVI haven't got time to explain in detail.
p273
aVBasically what it told me was \u2014
p274
aV(Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p275
aVthe kinds of countries we prefer are good countries.
p276
aVWe don't admire countries primarily because they're rich,
p277
aVbecause they're powerful, because they're successful,
p278
aVbecause they're modern, because they're technologically advanced.
p279
aVWe primarily admire countries that are good.
p280
aVWhat do we mean by good?
p281
aVWe mean countries that seem to contribute
p282
aVsomething to the world in which we live,
p283
aVcountries that actually make the world safer
p284
aVor better or richer or fairer.
p285
aVThose are the countries we like.
p286
aVThis is a discovery of significant importance \u2014
p287
aVyou see where I'm going \u2014
p288
aVbecause it squares the circle.
p289
aVI can now say, and often do, to any government,
p290
aVin order to do well, you need to do good.
p291
aVIf you want to sell more products,
p292
aVif you want to get more investment,
p293
aVif you want to become more competitive,
p294
aVthen you need to start behaving,
p295
aVbecause that's why people will respect you
p296
aVand do business with you,
p297
aVand therefore, the more you collaborate,
p298
aVthe more competitive you become.
p299
aa(lp300
VThis is quite an important discovery,
p301
aVand as soon as I discovered this,
p302
aVI felt another index coming on.
p303
aVI swear that as I get older, my ideas become simpler
p304
aVand more and more childish.
p305
aVThis one is called the Good Country Index,
p306
aVand it does exactly what it says on the tin.
p307
aVIt measures, or at least it tries to measure,
p308
aVexactly how much each country on Earth contributes
p309
aVnot to its own population but to the rest of humanity.
p310
aVBizarrely, nobody had ever thought
p311
aVof measuring this before.
p312
aVSo my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent
p313
aVthe best part of the last two years,
p314
aVwith the help of a large number of very serious and clever people,
p315
aVcramming together all the reliable data in the world
p316
aVwe could find about what countries give
p317
aVto the world.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd you're waiting for me to tell you which one comes top.
p320
aVAnd I'm going to tell you,
p321
aVbut first of all I want to tell you
p322
aVprecisely what I mean
p323
aVwhen I say a good country.
p324
aVI do not mean morally good.
p325
aVWhen I say that Country X
p326
aVis the goodest country on Earth,
p327
aVand I mean goodest, I don't mean best.
p328
aVBest is something different.
p329
aVWhen you're talking about a good country,
p330
aVyou can be good, gooder and goodest.
p331
aVIt's not the same thing as good, better and best.
p332
aVThis is a country which simply gives more
p333
aVto humanity than any other country.
p334
aVI don't talk about how they behave at home
p335
aVbecause that's measured elsewhere.
p336
aVAnd the winner is
p337
aVIreland.
p338
aV(Applause)
p339
aVAccording to the data here,
p340
aVno country on Earth, per head of population,
p341
aVper dollar of GDP, contributes more
p342
aVto the world that we live in than Ireland.
p343
aVWhat does this mean?
p344
aVThis means that as we go to sleep at night,
p345
aVall of us in the last 15 seconds before we drift off to sleep,
p346
aVour final thought should be,
p347
aVgodammit, I'm glad that Ireland exists.
p348
aV(Laughter)
p349
aVAnd that \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p350
aVIn the depths of a very severe economic recession,
p351
aVI think that there's a really important lesson there,
p352
aVthat if you can remember your international obligations
p353
aVwhilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy,
p354
aVthat's really something.
p355
aVFinland ranks pretty much the same.
p356
aVThe only reason why it's below Ireland
p357
aVis because its lowest score is lower than Ireland's lowest score.
p358
aa(lp359
VNow the other thing you'll notice about the top 10 there
p360
aVis, of course, they're all, apart from New Zealand,
p361
aVWestern European nations.
p362
aVThey're also all rich.
p363
aVThis depressed me,
p364
aVbecause one of the things that I did not want
p365
aVto discover with this index
p366
aVis that it's purely the province of rich countries
p367
aVto help poor countries.
p368
aVThis is not what it's all about.
p369
aVAnd indeed, if you look further down the list,
p370
aVI don't have the slide here, you will see
p371
aVsomething that made me very happy indeed,
p372
aVthat Kenya is in the top 30,
p373
aVand that demonstrates one very, very important thing.
p374
aVThis is not about money.
p375
aVThis is about attitude.
p376
aVThis is about culture.
p377
aVThis is about a government and a people that care
p378
aVabout the rest of the world
p379
aVand have the imagination and the courage
p380
aVto think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly.
p381
aa(lp382
VI'm going to whip through the other slides
p383
aVjust so you can see some of the lower-lying countries.
p384
aVThere's Germany at 13th, the U.S. comes 21st,
p385
aVMexico comes 66th,
p386
aVand then we have some of the big developing countries,
p387
aVlike Russia at 95th, China at 107th.
p388
aVCountries like China and Russia and India,
p389
aVwhich is down in the same part of the index,
p390
aVwell, in some ways, it's not surprising.
p391
aVThey've spent a great deal of time
p392
aVover the last decades building their own economy,
p393
aVbuilding their own society and their own polity,
p394
aVbut it is to be hoped
p395
aVthat the second phase of their growth
p396
aVwill be somewhat more outward-looking
p397
aVthan the first phase has been so far.
p398
aa(lp399
VAnd then you can break down each country
p400
aVin terms of the actual datasets that build into it.
p401
aVI'll allow you to do that.
p402
aVFrom midnight tonight it's going to be on goodcountry.org,
p403
aVand you can look at the country.
p404
aVYou can look right down to the level of the individual datasets.
p405
aa(lp406
VNow that's the Good Country Index.
p407
aVWhat's it there for?
p408
aVWell, it's there really because I want to try
p409
aVto introduce this word,
p410
aVor reintroduce this word, into the discourse.
p411
aVI've had enough hearing about competitive countries.
p412
aVI've had enough hearing about
p413
aVprosperous, wealthy, fast-growing countries.
p414
aVI've even had enough hearing about happy countries
p415
aVbecause in the end that's still selfish.
p416
aVThat's still about us,
p417
aVand if we carry on thinking about us,
p418
aVwe are in deep, deep trouble.
p419
aVI think we all know what it is
p420
aVthat we want to hear about.
p421
aVWe want to hear about good countries,
p422
aVand so I want to ask you all a favor.
p423
aVI'm not asking a lot.
p424
aVIt's something that you might find easy to do
p425
aVand you might even find enjoyable
p426
aVand even helpful to do,
p427
aVand that's simply to start using the word "good"
p428
aVin this context.
p429
aVWhen you think about your own country,
p430
aVwhen you think about other people's countries,
p431
aVwhen you think about companies,
p432
aVwhen you talk about the world that we live in today,
p433
aVstart using that word
p434
aVin the way that I've talked about this evening.
p435
aVNot good, the opposite of bad,
p436
aVbecause that's an argument that never finishes.
p437
aVGood, the opposite of selfish,
p438
aVgood being a country that thinks about all of us.
p439
aVThat's what I would like you to do,
p440
aVand I'd like you to use it as a stick
p441
aVwith which to beat your politicians.
p442
aVWhen you elect them, when you reelect them,
p443
aVwhen you vote for them, when you listen
p444
aVto what they're offering you,
p445
aVuse that word, "good,"
p446
aVand ask yourself,
p447
aV"Is that what a good country would do?"
p448
aVAnd if the answer is no, be very suspicious.
p449
aVAsk yourself, is that the behavior
p450
aVof my country?
p451
aVDo I want to come from a country
p452
aVwhere the government, in my name,
p453
aVis doing things like that?
p454
aVOr do I, on the other hand,
p455
aVprefer the idea of walking around the world
p456
aVwith my head held high thinking, "Yeah,
p457
aVI'm proud to come from a good country"?
p458
aVAnd everybody will welcome you.
p459
aVAnd everybody in the last 15 seconds
p460
aVbefore they drift off to sleep at night will say,
p461
aV"Gosh, I'm glad that person's country exists."
p462
aa(lp463
VUltimately, that, I think,
p464
aVis what will make the change.

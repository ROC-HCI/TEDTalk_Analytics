VOne of my favorite parts
p5
aVof my job at the Gates Foundation
p6
aVis that I get to travel to the developing world,
p7
aVand I do that quite regularly.
p8
aVAnd when I meet the mothers
p9
aVin so many of these remote places,
p10
aVI'm really struck by the things
p11
aVthat we have in common.
p12
aVThey want what we want for our children
p13
aVand that is for their children to grow up successful,
p14
aVto be healthy, and to have a successful life.
p15
aVBut I also see lots of poverty,
p16
aVand it's quite jarring,
p17
aVboth in the scale and the scope of it.
p18
aVMy first trip in India, I was in a person's home
p19
aVwhere they had dirt floors, no running water,
p20
aVno electricity,
p21
aVand that's really what I see all over the world.
p22
aVSo in short, I'm startled by all the things
p23
aVthat they don't have.
p24
aVBut I am surprised by one thing that they do have:
p25
aVCoca-Cola.
p26
aa(lp27
VCoke is everywhere.
p28
aVIn fact, when I travel to the developing world,
p29
aVCoke feels ubiquitous.
p30
aVAnd so when I come back from these trips,
p31
aVand I'm thinking about development,
p32
aVand I'm flying home and I'm thinking,
p33
aV"We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations,"
p34
aVyou know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder:
p35
aVhow is it that they can get Coke
p36
aVto these far-flung places?
p37
aVIf they can do that,
p38
aVwhy can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?
p39
aVAnd I'm not the first person to ask this question.
p40
aVBut I think, as a community,
p41
aVwe still have a lot to learn.
p42
aVIt's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.
p43
aVThey sell 1.5 billion servings
p44
aVevery single day.
p45
aVThat's like every man, woman and child on the planet
p46
aVhaving a serving of Coke every week.
p47
aVSo why does this matter?
p48
aVWell, if we're going to speed up the progress
p49
aVand go even faster
p50
aVon the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world,
p51
aVwe need to learn from the innovators,
p52
aVand those innovators
p53
aVcome from every single sector.
p54
aVI feel that, if we can understand
p55
aVwhat makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous,
p56
aVwe can apply those lessons then for the public good.
p57
aa(lp58
VCoke's success is relevant,
p59
aVbecause if we can analyze it, learn from it,
p60
aVthen we can save lives.
p61
aVSo that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.
p62
aVAnd I think there are really three things
p63
aVwe can take away from Coca-Cola.
p64
aVThey take real-time data
p65
aVand immediately feed it back into the product.
p66
aVThey tap into local entrepreneurial talent,
p67
aVand they do incredible marketing.
p68
aVSo let's start with the data.
p69
aVNow Coke has a very clear bottom line \u2014
p70
aVthey report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.
p71
aVSo they take the data,
p72
aVand they use it to measure progress.
p73
aVThey have this very continuous feedback loop.
p74
aVThey learn something, they put it back into the product,
p75
aVthey put it back into the market.
p76
aVThey have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."
p77
aVIt's a lot like other consumer companies.
p78
aVSo if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola,
p79
aVand you have a 107 constituencies,
p80
aVyou know where every can versus bottle
p81
aVof Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold,
p82
aVwhether it was a corner store,
p83
aVa supermarket or a pushcart.
p84
aVSo if sales start to drop,
p85
aVthen the person can identify the problem
p86
aVand address the issue.
p87
aa(lp88
VLet's contrast that for a minute to development.
p89
aVIn development, the evaluation comes
p90
aVat the very end of the project.
p91
aVI've sat in a lot of those meetings,
p92
aVand by then,
p93
aVit is way too late to use the data.
p94
aVI had somebody from an NGO
p95
aVonce describe it to me as bowling in the dark.
p96
aVThey said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.
p97
aVIt's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on,
p98
aVand then you an see your impact."
p99
aVReal-time data
p100
aVturns on the lights.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo what's the second thing that Coke's good at?
p103
aVThey're good at tapping into
p104
aVthat local entrepreneurial talent.
p105
aVCoke's been in Africa since 1928,
p106
aVbut most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets,
p107
aVbecause they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world,
p108
aVwhich was a large truck rolling down the street.
p109
aVAnd in Africa, the remote places,
p110
aVit's hard to find a good road.
p111
aVBut Coke noticed something \u2014
p112
aVthey noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk
p113
aVand then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.
p114
aVAnd so they took a bit of time to learn about that.
p115
aVAnd they decided in 1990
p116
aVthat they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs,
p117
aVgiving them small loans.
p118
aVThey set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers,
p119
aVand those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people,
p120
aVwho go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows
p121
aVto sell the product.
p122
aVThere are now some 3,000 of these centers
p123
aVemploying about 15,000 people in Africa.
p124
aVIn Tanzania and Uganda,
p125
aVthey represent 90 percent
p126
aVof Coke's sales.
p127
aVLet's look at the development side.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhat is it that governments and NGOs
p130
aVcan learn from Coke?
p131
aVGovernments and NGOs
p132
aVneed to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well,
p133
aVbecause the locals know how to reach
p134
aVthe very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors,
p135
aVand they know what motivates them to make change.
p136
aVI think a great example of this
p137
aVis Ethiopia's new health extension program.
p138
aVThe government noticed in Ethiopia
p139
aVthat many of the people were so far away from a health clinic,
p140
aVthey were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.
p141
aVSo if you're in an emergency situation \u2014 or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby \u2014
p142
aVforget it, to get to the health care center.
p143
aVThey decided that wasn't good enough,
p144
aVso they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala
p145
aVthat also had a system like this,
p146
aVand they adapted it for Ethiopia.
p147
aVAnd in 2003, the government of Ethiopia
p148
aVstarted this new system in their own country.
p149
aVThey trained 35,000 health extension workers
p150
aVto deliver care directly to the people.
p151
aVIn just five years,
p152
aVtheir ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people
p153
aVto one worker for every 2,500 people.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, think about
p156
aVhow this can change people's lives.
p157
aVHealth extension workers can help with so many things,
p158
aVwhether it's family planning, prenatal care,
p159
aVimmunizations for the children,
p160
aVor advising the woman to get to the facility on time
p161
aVfor an on-time delivery.
p162
aVThat is having real impact
p163
aVin a country like Ethiopia,
p164
aVand it's why you see their child mortality numbers
p165
aVcoming down 25 percent
p166
aVfrom 2000 to 2008.
p167
aVIn Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living
p168
aVbecause of this health extension worker program.
p169
aVSo what's the next step for Ethiopia?
p170
aVWell, they're already starting talk about this.
p171
aVThey're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers
p172
aVgenerate their own ideas?
p173
aVHow do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting
p174
aVout in those remote villages?"
p175
aVThat's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent
p176
aVand you unlock people's potential.
p177
aa(lp178
VThe third component of Coke's success
p179
aVis marketing.
p180
aVUltimately, Coke's success
p181
aVdepends on one crucial fact
p182
aVand that is that people want
p183
aVa Coca-Cola.
p184
aVNow the reason these micro-entrepreneurs
p185
aVcan sell or make a profit
p186
aVis they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.
p187
aVSo, they rely on Coca-Cola
p188
aVin terms of its marketing,
p189
aVand what's the secret to their marketing?
p190
aVWell, it's aspirational.
p191
aVIt is associated that product
p192
aVwith a kind of life that people want to live.
p193
aVSo even though it's a global company,
p194
aVthey take a very local approach.
p195
aVCoke's global campaign slogan
p196
aVis "Open Happiness."
p197
aVBut they localize it.
p198
aVAnd they don't just guess what makes people happy;
p199
aVthey go to places like Latin America
p200
aVand they realize that happiness there
p201
aVis associated with family life.
p202
aVAnd in South Africa,
p203
aVthey associate happiness
p204
aVwith seriti or community respect.
p205
aVNow, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.
p206
aVLet's listen to this song that Coke created for it,
p207
aV"Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Video) K'Naan: \u266b Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b
p210
aV\u266b Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh \u266b
p211
aV\u266b Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b
p212
aV\u266b Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b
p213
aV\u266bGive you freedom, give you fire\u266b
p214
aV\u266b Give you reason, take you higher \u266b
p215
aV\u266b See the champions take the field now \u266b
p216
aV\u266b You define us, make us feel proud \u266b
p217
aV\u266b In the streets our heads are lifted \u266b
p218
aV\u266b As we lose our inhibition \u266b
p219
aV\u266b Celebration, it's around us \u266b
p220
aV\u266b Every nation, all around us \u266b
p221
aa(lp222
VMelinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?
p223
aVWell, they didn't stop there \u2014
p224
aVthey localized it into 18 different languages.
p225
aVAnd it went number one on the pop chart
p226
aVin 17 countries.
p227
aVIt reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood,
p228
aV"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,"
p229
aVthat also went number one on the pop charts.
p230
aVBoth songs have something in common:
p231
aVthat same appeal
p232
aVof celebration and unity.
p233
aVSo how does health and development market?
p234
aVWell, it's based on avoidance,
p235
aVnot aspirations.
p236
aVI'm sure you've heard some of these messages.
p237
aV"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."
p238
aV"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."
p239
aVIt doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd I think we make a fundamental mistake \u2014
p242
aVwe make an assumption,
p243
aVthat we think that, if people need something,
p244
aVwe don't have to make them want that.
p245
aVAnd I think that's a mistake.
p246
aVAnd there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.
p247
aVOne example is sanitation.
p248
aVWe know that a million and a half children
p249
aVdie a year from diarrhea
p250
aVand a lot of it is because of open defecation.
p251
aVBut there's a solution: you build a toilet.
p252
aVBut what we're finding around the world, over and over again,
p253
aVis, if you build a toilet and you leave it there,
p254
aVit doesn't get used.
p255
aVPeople reuse it for a slab for their home.
p256
aVThey sometimes store grain in it.
p257
aVI've even seen it used for a chicken coop.
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aVBut what does marketing really entail
p260
aVthat would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?
p261
aVWell, you work with the community.
p262
aVYou start to talk to them about why open defecation
p263
aVis something that shouldn't be done in the village,
p264
aVand they agree to that.
p265
aVBut then you take the toilet and you position it
p266
aVas a modern, trendy convenience.
p267
aVOne state in Northern India has gone so far
p268
aVas to link toilets to courtship.
p269
aVAnd it works \u2014 look at these headlines.
p270
aV(Laughter)
p271
aVI'm not kidding.
p272
aVWomen are refusing to marry men without toilets.
p273
aVNo loo, no "I do."
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VNow, it's not just a funny headline \u2014
p278
aVit's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.
p279
aVBut more importantly,
p280
aVit saves lives.
p281
aVTake a look at this \u2014
p282
aVthis is a room full of young men
p283
aVand my husband, Bill.
p284
aVAnd can you guess what the young men are waiting for?
p285
aVThey're waiting to be circumcised.
p286
aVCan you you believe that?
p287
aVWe know that circumcision reduces HIV infection
p288
aVby 60 percent in men.
p289
aVAnd when we first heard this result inside the Foundation,
p290
aVI have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit
p291
aVand we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"
p292
aVBut it turns out the men do,
p293
aVbecause they're hearing from their girlfriends
p294
aVthat they prefer it,
p295
aVand the men also believe it improves their sex life.
p296
aVSo if we can start to understand
p297
aVwhat people really want
p298
aVin health and development,
p299
aVwe can change communities
p300
aVand we can change whole nations.
p301
aa(lp302
VWell, why is all of this so important?
p303
aVSo let's talk about what happens when this all comes together,
p304
aVwhen you tie the three things together.
p305
aVAnd polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.
p306
aVWe've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.
p307
aVSo if you look back to 1988,
p308
aVthere are about 350,000 cases of polio
p309
aVon the planet that year.
p310
aVIn 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.
p311
aVWell how did that happen?
p312
aVLet's look at a country like India.
p313
aVThey have over a billion people in this country,
p314
aVbut they have 35,000 local doctors
p315
aVwho report paralysis,
p316
aVand clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.
p317
aVThey have two and a half million vaccinators.
p318
aVBut let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.
p319
aVLet me tell you the story of Shriram,
p320
aVan 18 month boy in Bihar,
p321
aVa northern state in India.
p322
aVThis year on August 8th, he felt paralysis
p323
aVand on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.
p324
aVOn August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample,
p325
aVand by the 25th of August,
p326
aVit was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.
p327
aVBy August 30th, a genetic test was done,
p328
aVand we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.
p329
aa(lp330
VNow it could have come from one of two places.
p331
aVIt could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border,
p332
aVor from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.
p333
aVLuckily, the genetic testing proved
p334
aVthat, in fact, this strand came north,
p335
aVbecause, had it come from the south,
p336
aVit would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.
p337
aVSo many more people would have been affected.
p338
aVSo what's the endgame?
p339
aVWell on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign,
p340
aVwhich is what you do in polio.
p341
aVThey went out and where Shriram lives,
p342
aVthey vaccinated two million people.
p343
aVSo in less than a month,
p344
aVwe went from one case of paralysis
p345
aVto a targeted vaccination program.
p346
aVAnd I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.
p347
aVThat's how you keep
p348
aVa huge outbreak from spreading,
p349
aVand it shows what can happen
p350
aVwhen local people have the data in their hands;
p351
aVthey can save lives.
p352
aa(lp353
VNow one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing,
p354
aVbut it might not be what you think.
p355
aVIt's not the marketing on the ground.
p356
aVIt's not telling the parents,
p357
aV"If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor
p358
aVor get your child vaccinated."
p359
aVWe have a problem with marketing in the donor community.
p360
aVThe G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio
p361
aVover the last 20 years,
p362
aVbut we're starting to have something called polio fatigue
p363
aVand that is that the donor nations
p364
aVaren't willing to fund polio any longer.
p365
aVSo by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.
p366
aVSo we are 99 percent
p367
aVof the way there on this goal
p368
aVand we're about to run short of money.
p369
aVAnd I think that if the marketing were more aspirational,
p370
aVif we could focus as a community
p371
aVon how far we've come
p372
aVand how amazing it would be
p373
aVto eradicate this disease,
p374
aVwe could put polio fatigue
p375
aVand polio behind us.
p376
aVAnd if we could do that,
p377
aVwe could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide,
p378
aVin all of our countries for polio.
p379
aVAnd it would only be the second disease ever
p380
aVwiped off the face of the planet.
p381
aVAnd we are so close.
p382
aVAnd this victory is so possible.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo if Coke's marketers came to me
p385
aVand asked me to define happiness,
p386
aVI'd say my vision of happiness
p387
aVis a mother holding healthy baby
p388
aVin her arms.
p389
aVTo me, that is deep happiness.
p390
aVAnd so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector,
p391
aVthen in the future we make together,
p392
aVthat happiness
p393
aVcan be just as ubiquitous
p394
aVas Coca-Cola.
p395
aa(lp396
VThank you.

aa(lp10
VNarrator: Many of the tests are conducted
p11
aVwhile Yves is strapped onto the wing,
p12
aVbecause Yves' body is an integral part of the aircraft.
p13
aa(lp14
V[Wind tunnel tests]
p15
aa(lp16
VNarrator: The wing has no steering controls, no flaps, no rudder.
p17
aVYves uses his body to steer the wing.
p18
aa(lp19
VStefan Von Bergen: Well, he turns
p20
aVby just putting his head on one or the other side.
p21
aVAnd sometimes he assists that with his hands,
p22
aVsometimes even with the leg.
p23
aVHe's acting as a human fuselage, so to say.
p24
aVAnd that's quite unique.
p25
aa(lp26
VNarrator: When he arches his back, he gains altitude.
p27
aVWhen he pushes his shoulders forward, he goes into a dive.

aa(lp35
VCommentator One: There he goes.
p36
aVThere is Yves Rossy.
p37
aVAnd I think the wing is open.
p38
aVSo our first critical moment, it's open.
p39
aVHe is down. Is he flying?
p40
aa(lp41
VCommentator Two: It looks like he's stabilized.
p42
aVHe's starting to make his climb.
p43
aa(lp44
VCommentator One: There's that 90 degree turn.
p45
aVHe's out over the channel.
p46
aVThere is Yves Rossy.
p47
aVThere is no turning back now.
p48
aVHe is over the English Channel and under way.
p49
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p50
aVa historic flight has begun.
p51
aa(lp52
V[Images: National Geographic]
p53
aa(lp54
VCommentator Two: And as he approaches the ground,
p55
aVhe's going to pull down on those toggles to flare,
p56
aVslow himself down just a little bit,
p57
aVand then come in for a nice landing.
p58
aa(lp59
VCommentator One: There he is.
p60
aVYves Rossy has landed in England.
p61
aa(lp62
VBruno Giussani: And now he's in Edinburgh. Yves Rossy!
p63
aa(lp64
V(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
V(Applause ends)
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd his equipment as well.
p69
aVYves, welcome. It is quite amazing.
p70
aVThose sequences were shot over the last three years
p71
aVin various moments of your activities.
p72
aVAnd there were many, many others.
p73
aVSo it's possible to fly almost like a bird.
p74
aVWhat is it like to be up there?
p75
aa(lp76
VYves Rossy: It's fun. It's fun.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VI don't have feathers.
p81
aVBut I feel like a bird sometimes.
p82
aVIt's really an unreal feeling,
p83
aVbecause normally you have a big thing,
p84
aVa plane, around you.
p85
aVAnd when I strap just this little harness,
p86
aVthis little wing,
p87
aVI really have the feeling of being a bird.
p88
aa(lp89
VBG: How did you start to become Jetman?
p90
aa(lp91
VYR: It was about 20 years ago,
p92
aVwhen I discovered free falling.
p93
aVWhen you go out of an airplane, you are almost naked.
p94
aVYou take a position like that.
p95
aVAnd especially when you take a tracking position,
p96
aVyou have the feeling that you are flying.
p97
aVAnd that's the nearest thing to the dream.
p98
aVYou have no machine around you.
p99
aVYou are just in the element.
p100
aVIt's very short and only in one direction.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VSo the idea was, okay,
p105
aVkeep that feeling of freedom,
p106
aVbut change the vector and increase the time.
p107
aa(lp108
VBG: So I'm kind of curious, what's your top speed?
p109
aa(lp110
VYR: It's about 300 km per hour before looping.
p111
aVThat means about 190 miles per hour.
p112
aa(lp113
VBG: What's the weight of the equipment you're carrying?
p114
aa(lp115
VYR: When I exit full of kerosene,
p116
aVI'm about 55 kilos.
p117
aVI have 55 kilos on my back.
p118
aa(lp119
VBG: And you're not piloting?
p120
aVThere is no handle, no steering, nothing?
p121
aVIt is purely your body,
p122
aVand the wings become part of the body and vice versa?
p123
aa(lp124
VYR: That's really the goal,
p125
aVbecause if you put in steering,
p126
aVthen you reinvent the airplane.
p127
aVAnd I wanted to keep this freedom of movement.
p128
aVAnd it's really like the kid playing the airplane.
p129
aVI want to go down like that.
p130
aVAnd up I climb, I turn.
p131
aVIt's really pure flying.
p132
aVIt's not steering, it's flight.
p133
aa(lp134
VBG: What kind of training do you do, you personally, for that?
p135
aa(lp136
VYR: Actually, I try to stay just fit.
p137
aVI don't do special physical training.
p138
aVI just try to keep my mobility through new activities.
p139
aVFor example, last winter I began with kite surfing.
p140
aVSo, new things.
p141
aVSo you have to adapt.
p142
aVI'm quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot,
p143
aVbut this is, really \u2014
p144
aVYou need fluidity,
p145
aVyou need to be agile
p146
aVand also to adapt really fast.
p147
aa(lp148
VBG: Somebody in the audience asked me,
p149
aV"How does he breathe up there?"
p150
aVBecause you're going fast and you're up at 3,000 meters or so.
p151
aa(lp152
VYR: Okay, up to 3,000 meters,
p153
aVit's not such a big problem with oxygen.
p154
aVBut for example, bikers,
p155
aVthey have the same speed.
p156
aVJust with the helmet, integral helmet,
p157
aVit's really no problem to breathe.
p158
aa(lp159
VBG: Describe for me the equipment, since you have it here.
p160
aVSo Breitling's four engines.
p161
aa(lp162
VYR: Yeah, two-meter span.
p163
aVUltra-stable profile.
p164
aVFour little engines,
p165
aV22 kilos thrust each,
p166
aVturbines, working with kerosene.
p167
aVHarness, parachute.
p168
aVMy only instruments are an altimeter and time.
p169
aVI know I have about eight minutes fuel.
p170
aVSo I just check before it's finished.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd yeah, that's all.
p175
aVTwo parachutes.
p176
aVThat means, if I have a problem with the first one I pull,
p177
aVI still have the possibility to open the second one.
p178
aVAnd this is my life.
p179
aVThat's the real important thing about safety.
p180
aVI did use that during these last 15 years
p181
aVabout 20 times.
p182
aVNever with that type of wing, but at the beginning.
p183
aVI can release my wing
p184
aVwhen I am in a spin or unstable.
p185
aa(lp186
VBG: We saw the 2009 crossing of the Gibraltar Strait
p187
aVwhere you lost control
p188
aVand then you dived down into the clouds
p189
aVand in the ocean.
p190
aVSo that was one of those cases where you let the wings go, right?
p191
aa(lp192
VYR: Yeah. I did try in the clouds,
p193
aVbut you lose orientation completely.
p194
aVSo I did try to take, again,
p195
aVa climb altitude.
p196
aVI thought, okay, I will go out.
p197
aVBut most probably, I did something like that.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VBG: Something that is not very safe, the image.
p202
aa(lp203
VYR: You feel great, but \u2014
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VBut you have not the right altitude.
p208
aVSo the next thing I saw was just blue.
p209
aVIt was the sea.
p210
aVI have also an audible altimeter.
p211
aVSo I was at my minimum altitude
p212
aVin that vector \u2014 fast \u2014
p213
aVso I pulled that.
p214
aVAnd then I did open my chute.
p215
aa(lp216
VBG: So the wings have their own parachute, and you have your two parachutes.
p217
aa(lp218
VYR: Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing
p219
aVfor two reasons:
p220
aVso I can repair it afterward
p221
aVand especially so nobody takes that, just on his head.
p222
aa(lp223
VBG: I see. Maybe come back here.
p224
aVThis is risky stuff indeed.
p225
aVPeople have died trying to do this kind of thing.
p226
aVAnd you don't look like a crazy guy; you're a Swiss airline pilot,
p227
aVso you're rather a checklist kind of guy.
p228
aVI assume you have standards.
p229
aa(lp230
VYR: Yeah. I have no checklist for that.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VBG: Let's not tell your employer.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VYR: No, that's really two worlds.
p239
aVCivil aviation is something that we know very well.
p240
aVWe have a hundred years of experience.
p241
aVAnd you can adapt really precisely.
p242
aVWith that, I have to adapt to something new.
p243
aVThat means improvise.
p244
aVSo it's really a play between these two approaches.
p245
aVSomething that I know very well, these principles.
p246
aVFor example, we have two engines on an Airbus;
p247
aVwith only one engine, you can fly it.
p248
aVSo plan B, always a plan B.
p249
aVIn a fighter, you have an ejection seat.
p250
aVThat's my ejection seat.
p251
aVSo I have the approach of a professional pilot
p252
aVwith the respect of a pioneer
p253
aVin front of Mother Nature.
p254
aa(lp255
VBG: It's well said.
p256
aVWhat happens if one of the engines stops?
p257
aa(lp258
VYR: I do a roll.
p259
aVAnd then I stabilize,
p260
aVand according to my altitude, I continue on two or three engines.
p261
aVIt's sometimes possible.
p262
aVIt's quite complicated to explain,
p263
aVbut according to which regime I was,
p264
aVI can continue on two
p265
aVand try to get a nice place to land, and then I open my parachute.
p266
aa(lp267
VBG: So the beginning of the flight
p268
aVis actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter,
p269
aVand you go on a dive and accelerate the engines,
p270
aVand then you basically take off mid-air somewhere.
p271
aVAnd then the landing, as we have seen,
p272
aVarriving on this side of the Channel,
p273
aVis through a parachute.
p274
aVSo just as a curiosity,
p275
aVwhere did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon?
p276
aVDid you land on the rim, down at the bottom?
p277
aa(lp278
VYR: It was down on the bottom.
p279
aVAnd I came back afterward on the sled of the helicopter back.
p280
aVBut it was too stony and full of cactus on top.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VBG: That's exactly why I asked the question.
p285
aa(lp286
VYR: And also, the currents are quite funny there.
p287
aVThere is big thermal activity,
p288
aVbig difference in altitude also.
p289
aVSo it was much safer for me to land at the bottom.
p290
aa(lp291
VBG: I think that right now, many people are asking,
p292
aV"When are you developing a double-seater
p293
aVso they can fly with you?"
p294
aa(lp295
VYR: I have a standard answer.
p296
aVHave you ever seen tandem birds?
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VBG: Perfect answer.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
V(Applause ends)
p305
aa(lp306
VBG: Yves, one last question.
p307
aVWhat's next for you? What's next for Jetman?
p308
aa(lp309
VYR: First, to instruct a younger guy.
p310
aVI want to share it, to do formation flights.
p311
aVAnd I plan to start from a cliff,
p312
aVlike catapulted from a cliff.
p313
aa(lp314
VBG: So instead of jumping off a plane, yes?
p315
aa(lp316
VYR: Yes, with the final goal to take off, but with initial speed.
p317
aVReally, I go step by step.
p318
aVIt seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.
p319
aVIt's possible to start already now, it's just too dangerous.
p320
aa(lp321
V(Laughter)
p322
aVThanks to the increasing technology, better technology,
p323
aVit will be safe.
p324
aVAnd I hope it will be for everybody.
p325
aa(lp326
VBG: Yves, thank you very much. Yves Rossy.

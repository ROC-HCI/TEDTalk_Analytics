VFifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean,
p5
aVno one \u2014 not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson \u2014
p6
aVimagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean
p7
aVby what we put into it or by what we took out of it.
p8
aVIt seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden,
p9
aVbut now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost.
p10
aa(lp11
VI want to share with you
p12
aVmy personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us,
p13
aVand to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost \u2014
p14
aVactually, we've taken, we've eaten \u2014
p15
aVmore than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea;
p16
aVwhy you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared;
p17
aVwhy a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific
p18
aVshould concern not only the creatures that are dying,
p19
aVbut it really should concern you.
p20
aVIt does concern you, as well.
p21
aa(lp22
VI'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child,"
p23
aVasking why we didn't do something on our watch
p24
aVto save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean
p25
aVwhile there still was time.
p26
aVWell, now is that time.
p27
aVI hope for your help
p28
aVto explore and protect the wild ocean
p29
aVin ways that will restore the health and,
p30
aVin so doing, secure hope for humankind.
p31
aVHealth to the ocean means health for us.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales
p34
aVand other sea creatures
p35
aVin this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.
p36
aVAnd I hope, Jill, that someday
p37
aVwe will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VDid I say that? I guess I did.
p42
aa(lp43
VFor me, as a scientist,
p44
aVit all began in 1953
p45
aVwhen I first tried scuba.
p46
aVIt's when I first got to know fish swimming
p47
aVin something other than lemon slices and butter.
p48
aVI actually love diving at night;
p49
aVyou see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime.
p50
aVDiving day and night was really easy for me in 1970,
p51
aVwhen I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time \u2014
p52
aVat the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.
p53
aVIn 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor
p54
aVwhile using this personal submersible called Jim.
p55
aVIt was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down.
p56
aVIt's one of my favorite bathing suits.
p57
aa(lp58
VSince then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines
p59
aVand I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search
p60
aVto design and build systems
p61
aVto access the deep sea.
p62
aVI led a five-year National Geographic expedition,
p63
aVthe Sustainable Seas expeditions,
p64
aVusing these little subs.
p65
aVThey're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it.
p66
aVAnd I'm living proof.
p67
aVAstronauts and aquanauts alike
p68
aVreally appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature \u2014
p69
aVall the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea.
p70
aVI heard astronaut Joe Allen explain
p71
aVhow he had to learn everything he could about his life support system
p72
aVand then do everything he could
p73
aVto take care of his life support system;
p74
aVand then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."
p75
aVWe need to learn everything we can about it
p76
aVand do everything we can to take care of it.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love;
p79
aVnone without water."
p80
aVNinety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean.
p81
aVNo blue, no green.
p82
aVIf you think the ocean isn't important,
p83
aVimagine Earth without it.
p84
aVMars comes to mind.
p85
aVNo ocean, no life support system.
p86
aVI gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank
p87
aVand I showed this amazing image of Earth
p88
aVand I said, "There it is! The World Bank!"
p89
aVThat's where all the assets are!
p90
aVAnd we've been trawling them down
p91
aVmuch faster than the natural systems can replenish them.
p92
aa(lp93
VTim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment.
p94
aVWith every drop of water you drink,
p95
aVevery breath you take,
p96
aVyou're connected to the sea.
p97
aVNo matter where on Earth you live.
p98
aVMost of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea.
p99
aVOver time, most of the planet's organic carbon
p100
aVhas been absorbed and stored there,
p101
aVmostly by microbes.
p102
aVThe ocean drives climate and weather,
p103
aVstabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry.
p104
aVWater from the sea forms clouds
p105
aVthat return to the land and the seas
p106
aVas rain, sleet and snow,
p107
aVand provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world,
p108
aVmaybe in the universe.
p109
aVNo water, no life;
p110
aVno blue, no green.
p111
aa(lp112
VYet we have this idea, we humans,
p113
aVthat the Earth \u2014 all of it: the oceans, the skies \u2014
p114
aVare so vast and so resilient
p115
aVit doesn't matter what we do to it.
p116
aVThat may have been true 10,000 years ago,
p117
aVand maybe even 1,000 years ago
p118
aVbut in the last 100, especially in the last 50,
p119
aVwe've drawn down the assets,
p120
aVthe air, the water, the wildlife
p121
aVthat make our lives possible.
p122
aVNew technologies are helping us to understand
p123
aVthe nature of nature;
p124
aVthe nature of what's happening,
p125
aVshowing us our impact on the Earth.
p126
aVI mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem.
p127
aVAnd fortunately, in our time,
p128
aVwe've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history.
p129
aVAnd with knowing comes caring.
p130
aVAnd with caring, there's hope
p131
aVthat we can find an enduring place for ourselves
p132
aVwithin the natural systems that support us.
p133
aVBut first we have to know.
p134
aa(lp135
VThree years ago, I met John Hanke,
p136
aVwho's the head of Google Earth,
p137
aVand I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands
p138
aVand go exploring vicariously.
p139
aVBut I asked him: "When are you going to finish it?
p140
aVYou did a great job with the land, the dirt.
p141
aVWhat about the water?"
p142
aVSince then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers,
p143
aVwith DOER Marine, with National Geographic,
p144
aVwith dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world,
p145
aVones that we could enlist,
p146
aVto put the ocean in Google Earth.
p147
aVAnd as of just this week, last Monday,
p148
aVGoogle Earth is now whole.
p149
aa(lp150
VConsider this: Starting right here at the convention center,
p151
aVwe can find the nearby aquarium,
p152
aVwe can look at where we're sitting,
p153
aVand then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean,
p154
aVand California's four national marine sanctuaries,
p155
aVand the new network of state marine reserves
p156
aVthat are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets
p157
aVWe can flit over to Hawaii
p158
aVand see the real Hawaiian Islands:
p159
aVnot just the little bit that pokes through the surface,
p160
aVbut also what's below.
p161
aVTo see \u2014 wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! \u2014
p162
aVright there, ha \u2014
p163
aVunder the ocean, see what the whales see.
p164
aVWe can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands.
p165
aVWe can go actually and swim around on Google Earth
p166
aVand visit with humpback whales.
p167
aVThese are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face
p168
aVmany times underwater.
p169
aVThere's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale.
p170
aa(lp171
VWe can pick up and fly to the deepest place:
p172
aVseven miles down, the Mariana Trench,
p173
aVwhere only two people have ever been.
p174
aVImagine that. It's only seven miles,
p175
aVbut only two people have been there, 49 years ago.
p176
aVOne-way trips are easy.
p177
aVWe need new deep-diving submarines.
p178
aVHow about some X Prizes for ocean exploration?
p179
aVWe need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains,
p180
aVand understand life in the deep sea.
p181
aa(lp182
VWe can now go to the Arctic.
p183
aVJust ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole.
p184
aVAn ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century.
p185
aVThat's bad news for the polar bears.
p186
aVThat's bad news for us too.
p187
aVExcess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming,
p188
aVit's also changing ocean chemistry,
p189
aVmaking the sea more acidic.
p190
aVThat's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.
p191
aVAlso it's bad news for us.
p192
aVWe're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic
p193
aVand other trash into the sea.
p194
aVMillions of tons of discarded fishing nets,
p195
aVgear that continues to kill.
p196
aVWe're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system,
p197
aVand we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife,
p198
aVall carbon-based units.
p199
aVBarbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup,
p200
aVundermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry
p201
aVand drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle,
p202
aVthe oxygen cycle, the water cycle \u2014
p203
aVour life support system.
p204
aVWe're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered
p205
aVand much more valuable alive than dead.
p206
aVAll of these parts are part of our life support system.
p207
aVWe kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet
p208
aVthat may stretch for 50 miles or more.
p209
aVIndustrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor
p210
aVlike bulldozers, taking everything in their path.
p211
aa(lp212
VUsing Google Earth you can witness trawlers \u2014
p213
aVin China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico \u2014
p214
aVshaking the foundation of our life support system,
p215
aVleaving plumes of death in their path.
p216
aVThe next time you dine on sushi \u2014 or sashimi,
p217
aVor swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail,
p218
aVwhatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean \u2014
p219
aVthink of the real cost.
p220
aVFor every pound that goes to market,
p221
aVmore than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds,
p222
aVmay be thrown away as bycatch.
p223
aVThis is the consequence of not knowing
p224
aVthat there are limits to what we can take out of the sea.
p225
aVThis chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife
p226
aVfrom 1900 to 2000.
p227
aVThe highest concentrations are in red.
p228
aVIn my lifetime, imagine,
p229
aV90 percent of the big fish have been killed.
p230
aVMost of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales
p231
aVare way down in numbers.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut, there is good news.
p234
aVTen percent of the big fish still remain.
p235
aVThere are still some blue whales.
p236
aVThere are still some krill in Antarctica.
p237
aVThere are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay.
p238
aVHalf the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape,
p239
aVa jeweled belt around the middle of the planet.
p240
aVThere's still time, but not a lot,
p241
aVto turn things around.
p242
aVBut business as usual means that in 50 years,
p243
aVthere may be no coral reefs \u2014
p244
aVand no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone.
p245
aVImagine the ocean without fish.
p246
aVImagine what that means to our life support system.
p247
aVNatural systems on the land are in big trouble too,
p248
aVbut the problems are more obvious,
p249
aVand some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park,
p252
aVthe United States began establishing a system of parks
p253
aVthat some say was the best idea America ever had.
p254
aVAbout 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected:
p255
aVsafeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink,
p256
aVgenerating oxygen, protecting watersheds.
p257
aVAnd, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea,
p258
aVNational Marine Sanctuaries.
p259
aVThat's another great idea.
p260
aVThe good news is
p261
aVthat there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world,
p262
aVthat have some kind of protection.
p263
aVAnd you can find them on Google Earth.
p264
aVThe bad news is
p265
aVthat you have to look hard to find them.
p266
aVIn the last three years, for example,
p267
aVthe U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments.
p268
aVBut it only increased from 0.6 of one percent
p269
aVto 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally.
p270
aVProtected areas do rebound,
p271
aVbut it takes a long time to restore
p272
aV50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass,
p273
aVor 200-year-old orange roughy.
p274
aVWe don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.
p275
aVProtected areas provide hope
p276
aVthat the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream
p277
aVof an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life,
p278
aVwill live not just as a list,
p279
aVa photograph, or a paragraph.
p280
aa(lp281
VWith scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean
p282
aVthat is open to fishing \u2014 and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever \u2014
p283
aVto search out hope spots,
p284
aVand try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.
p285
aVSuch as the Arctic \u2014
p286
aVwe have one chance, right now, to get it right.
p287
aVOr the Antarctic, where the continent is protected,
p288
aVbut the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish.
p289
aVSargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest
p290
aVis being gathered up to feed cows.
p291
aV97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected,
p292
aVbut the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing.
p293
aVIt's true too in Argentina
p294
aVon the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble.
p295
aVThe high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel \u2014
p296
aVthe largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth,
p297
aVfilled with luminous creatures,
p298
aVliving in dark waters that average two miles deep.
p299
aVThey flash, and sparkle, and glow
p300
aVwith their own living light.
p301
aa(lp302
VThere are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child.
p303
aVThe next 10 years may be the most important,
p304
aVand the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have
p305
aVto protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.
p306
aVTo cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power.
p307
aVWe need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.
p308
aVWe need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place.
p309
aVBut, nothing else will matter
p310
aVif we fail to protect the ocean.
p311
aVOur fate and the ocean's are one.
p312
aVWe need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above.
p313
aa(lp314
VA global plan of action
p315
aVwith a world conservation union, the IUCN,
p316
aVis underway to protect biodiversity,
p317
aVto mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change,
p318
aVon the high seas and in coastal areas,
p319
aVwherever we can identify critical places.
p320
aVNew technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore
p321
aVthe 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see.
p322
aVThe goal is to protect biodiversity,
p323
aVto provide stability and resilience.
p324
aVWe need deep-diving subs,
p325
aVnew technologies to explore the ocean.
p326
aVWe need, maybe, an expedition \u2014
p327
aVa TED at sea \u2014
p328
aVthat could help figure out the next steps.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is.
p331
aVI wish you would use all means at your disposal \u2014
p332
aVfilms, expeditions, the web, new submarines \u2014
p333
aVand campaign to ignite public support
p334
aVfor a global network of marine protected areas \u2014
p335
aVhope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean,
p336
aVthe blue heart of the planet.
p337
aVHow much?
p338
aVSome say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.
p339
aVYou decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?
p340
aVWhatever it is,
p341
aVa fraction of one percent is not enough.
p342
aVMy wish is a big wish,
p343
aVbut if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world,
p344
aVand help ensure the survival
p345
aVof what actually \u2014 as it turns out \u2014 is my favorite species;
p346
aVthat would be us.
p347
aVFor the children of today,
p348
aVfor tomorrow's child:
p349
aVas never again, now is the time.
p350
aa(lp351

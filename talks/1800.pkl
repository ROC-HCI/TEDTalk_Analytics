VThe day I left home for the first time
p5
aVto go to university was a bright day
p6
aVbrimming with hope and optimism.
p7
aVI'd done well at school. Expectations for me were high,
p8
aVand I gleefully entered the student life
p9
aVof lectures, parties and traffic cone theft.
p10
aVNow appearances, of course, can be deceptive,
p11
aVand to an extent, this feisty, energetic persona
p12
aVof lecture-going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer,
p13
aValbeit a very well-crafted and convincing one.
p14
aVUnderneath, I was actually deeply unhappy, insecure
p15
aVand fundamentally frightened \u2014
p16
aVfrightened of other people, of the future, of failure
p17
aVand of the emptiness that I felt was within me.
p18
aVBut I was skilled at hiding it, and from the outside
p19
aVappeared to be someone with everything to hope for
p20
aVand aspire to.
p21
aVThis fantasy of invulnerability was so complete
p22
aVthat I even deceived myself,
p23
aVand as the first semester ended and the second began,
p24
aVthere was no way that anyone could have predicted
p25
aVwhat was just about to happen.
p26
aVI was leaving a seminar when it started,
p27
aVhumming to myself, fumbling with my bag
p28
aVjust as I'd done a hundred times before,
p29
aVwhen suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe,
p30
aV"She is leaving the room."
p31
aVI looked around, and there was no one there,
p32
aVbut the clarity and decisiveness of the comment
p33
aVwas unmistakable.
p34
aVShaken, I left my books on the stairs and hurried home,
p35
aVand there it was again.
p36
aV"She is opening the door."
p37
aVThis was the beginning. The voice had arrived.
p38
aVAnd the voice persisted,
p39
aVdays and then weeks of it, on and on,
p40
aVnarrating everything I did in the third person.
p41
aV"She is going to the library."
p42
aV"She is going to a lecture."
p43
aVIt was neutral, impassive and even, after a while,
p44
aVstrangely companionate and reassuring,
p45
aValthough I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped
p46
aVand that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion.
p47
aVSo, for example, if I was angry and had to hide it,
p48
aVwhich I often did, being very adept at concealing how I really felt,
p49
aVthen the voice would sound frustrated.
p50
aVOtherwise, it was neither sinister nor disturbing,
p51
aValthough even at that point it was clear
p52
aVthat it had something to communicate to me
p53
aVabout my emotions, particularly emotions
p54
aVwhich were remote and inaccessible.
p55
aVNow it was then that I made a fatal mistake,
p56
aVin that I told a friend about the voice, and she was horrified.
p57
aVA subtle conditioning process had begun,
p58
aVthe implication that normal people don't hear voices
p59
aVand the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong.
p60
aVSuch fear and mistrust was infectious.
p61
aVSuddenly the voice didn't seem quite so benign anymore,
p62
aVand when she insisted that I seek medical attention,
p63
aVI duly complied, and which proved to be
p64
aVmistake number two.
p65
aVI spent some time telling the college G.P.
p66
aVabout what I perceived to be the real problem:
p67
aVanxiety, low self-worth, fears about the future,
p68
aVand was met with bored indifference
p69
aVuntil I mentioned the voice,
p70
aVupon which he dropped his pen, swung round
p71
aVand began to question me with a show of real interest.
p72
aVAnd to be fair, I was desperate for interest and help,
p73
aVand I began to tell him about my strange commentator.
p74
aVAnd I always wish, at this point, the voice had said,
p75
aV"She is digging her own grave."
p76
aVI was referred to a psychiatrist, who likewise
p77
aVtook a grim view of the voice's presence,
p78
aVsubsequently interpreting everything I said
p79
aVthrough a lens of latent insanity.
p80
aVFor example, I was part of a student TV station
p81
aVthat broadcast news bulletins around the campus,
p82
aVand during an appointment which was running very late,
p83
aVI said, "I'm sorry, doctor, I've got to go.
p84
aVI'm reading the news at six."
p85
aVNow it's down on my medical records that Eleanor
p86
aVhas delusions that she's a television news broadcaster.
p87
aVIt was at this point that events began
p88
aVto rapidly overtake me.
p89
aVA hospital admission followed, the first of many,
p90
aVa diagnosis of schizophrenia came next,
p91
aVand then, worst of all, a toxic, tormenting sense
p92
aVof hopelessness, humiliation and despair
p93
aVabout myself and my prospects.
p94
aVBut having been encouraged to see the voice
p95
aVnot as an experience but as a symptom,
p96
aVmy fear and resistance towards it intensified.
p97
aVNow essentially, this represented taking
p98
aVan aggressive stance towards my own mind,
p99
aVa kind of psychic civil war,
p100
aVand in turn this caused the number of voices to increase
p101
aVand grow progressively hostile and menacing.
p102
aVHelplessly and hopelessly, I began to retreat
p103
aVinto this nightmarish inner world
p104
aVin which the voices were destined to become
p105
aVboth my persecutors and my only perceived companions.
p106
aVThey told me, for example, that if I proved myself worthy
p107
aVof their help, then they could change my life
p108
aVback to how it had been,
p109
aVand a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set,
p110
aVa kind of labor of Hercules.
p111
aVIt started off quite small, for example,
p112
aVpull out three strands of hair,
p113
aVbut gradually it grew more extreme,
p114
aVculminating in commands to harm myself,
p115
aVand a particularly dramatic instruction:
p116
aV"You see that tutor over there?
p117
aVYou see that glass of water?
p118
aVWell, you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students."
p119
aVWhich I actually did, and which needless to say
p120
aVdid not endear me to the faculty.
p121
aVIn effect, a vicious cycle of fear, avoidance,
p122
aVmistrust and misunderstanding had been established,
p123
aVand this was a battle in which I felt powerless
p124
aVand incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation.
p125
aVTwo years later, and the deterioration was dramatic.
p126
aVBy now, I had the whole frenzied repertoire:
p127
aVterrifying voices, grotesque visions,
p128
aVbizarre, intractable delusions.
p129
aVMy mental health status had been a catalyst
p130
aVfor discrimination, verbal abuse,
p131
aVand physical and sexual assault,
p132
aVand I'd been told by my psychiatrist,
p133
aV"Eleanor, you'd be better off with cancer,
p134
aVbecause cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia."
p135
aVI'd been diagnosed, drugged and discarded,
p136
aVand was by now so tormented by the voices
p137
aVthat I attempted to drill a hole in my head
p138
aVin order to get them out.
p139
aVNow looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years,
p140
aVit seems to me now as if someone died in that place,
p141
aVand yet, someone else was saved.
p142
aVA broken and haunted person began that journey,
p143
aVbut the person who emerged was a survivor
p144
aVand would ultimately grow into the person
p145
aVI was destined to be.
p146
aVMany people have harmed me in my life,
p147
aVand I remember them all,
p148
aVbut the memories grow pale and faint
p149
aVin comparison with the people who've helped me.
p150
aVThe fellow survivors, the fellow voice-hearers,
p151
aVthe comrades and collaborators;
p152
aVthe mother who never gave up on me,
p153
aVwho knew that one day I would come back to her
p154
aVand was willing to wait for me for as long as it took;
p155
aVthe doctor who only worked with me for a brief time
p156
aVbut who reinforced his belief that recovery
p157
aVwas not only possible but inevitable,
p158
aVand during a devastating period of relapse
p159
aVtold my terrified family, "Don't give up hope.
p160
aVI believe that Eleanor can get through this.
p161
aVSometimes, you know, it snows as late as May,
p162
aVbut summer always comes eventually."
p163
aVFourteen minutes is not enough time
p164
aVto fully credit those good and generous people
p165
aVwho fought with me and for me
p166
aVand who waited to welcome me back
p167
aVfrom that agonized, lonely place.
p168
aVBut together, they forged a blend of courage,
p169
aVcreativity, integrity, and an unshakeable belief
p170
aVthat my shattered self could become healed and whole.
p171
aVI used to say that these people saved me,
p172
aVbut what I now know is they did something
p173
aVeven more important in that they empowered me
p174
aVto save myself,
p175
aVand crucially, they helped me to understand something
p176
aVwhich I'd always suspected:
p177
aVthat my voices were a meaningful response
p178
aVto traumatic life events, particularly childhood events,
p179
aVand as such were not my enemies
p180
aVbut a source of insight into solvable emotional problems.
p181
aVNow, at first, this was very difficult to believe,
p182
aVnot least because the voices appeared so hostile
p183
aVand menacing, so in this respect, a vital first step
p184
aVwas learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning
p185
aVfrom what I'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth.
p186
aVSo for example, voices which threatened to attack my home
p187
aVI learned to interpret as my own sense of fear
p188
aVand insecurity in the world, rather than an actual, objective danger.
p189
aVNow at first, I would have believed them.
p190
aVI remember, for example, sitting up one night
p191
aVon guard outside my parents' room to protect them
p192
aVfrom what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices.
p193
aVBecause I'd had such a bad problem with self-injury
p194
aVthat most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden,
p195
aVso I ended up arming myself with a plastic fork,
p196
aVkind of like picnic ware, and sort of sat outside the room
p197
aVclutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen.
p198
aVIt was like, "Don't mess with me.
p199
aVI've got a plastic fork, don't you know?"
p200
aVStrategic.
p201
aVBut a later response, and much more useful,
p202
aVwould be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words,
p203
aVso when the voices warned me not to leave the house,
p204
aVthen I would thank them for drawing my attention
p205
aVto how unsafe I felt \u2014
p206
aVbecause if I was aware of it, then I could do something positive about it \u2014
p207
aVbut go on to reassure both them and myself
p208
aVthat we were safe and didn't need to feel frightened anymore.
p209
aVI would set boundaries for the voices,
p210
aVand try to interact with them in a way that was assertive
p211
aVyet respectful, establishing a slow process
p212
aVof communication and collaboration
p213
aVin which we could learn to work together and support one another.
p214
aVThroughout all of this, what I would ultimately realize
p215
aVwas that each voice was closely related
p216
aVto aspects of myself, and that each of them
p217
aVcarried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had
p218
aVan opportunity to process or resolve,
p219
aVmemories of sexual trauma and abuse,
p220
aVof anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.
p221
aVThe voices took the place of this pain
p222
aVand gave words to it,
p223
aVand possibly one of the greatest revelations
p224
aVwas when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices
p225
aVactually represented the parts of me
p226
aVthat had been hurt most profoundly,
p227
aVand as such, it was these voices
p228
aVthat needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care.
p229
aVIt was armed with this knowledge that ultimately
p230
aVI would gather together my shattered self,
p231
aVeach fragment represented by a different voice,
p232
aVgradually withdraw from all my medication,
p233
aVand return to psychiatry, only this time from the other side.
p234
aVTen years after the voice first came, I finally graduated,
p235
aVthis time with the highest degree in psychology
p236
aVthe university had ever given, and one year later,
p237
aVthe highest masters, which shall we say
p238
aVisn't bad for a madwoman.
p239
aVIn fact, one of the voices actually dictated the answers
p240
aVduring the exam, which technically possibly counts as cheating.
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aVAnd to be honest, sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well.
p243
aVAs Oscar Wilde has said, the only thing worse
p244
aVthan being talked about is not being talked about.
p245
aVIt also makes you very good at eavesdropping,
p246
aVbecause you can listen to two conversations simultaneously.
p247
aVSo it's not all bad.
p248
aVI worked in mental health services,
p249
aVI spoke at conferences,
p250
aVI published book chapters and academic articles,
p251
aVand I argued, and continue to do so,
p252
aVthe relevance of the following concept:
p253
aVthat an important question in psychiatry
p254
aVshouldn't be what's wrong with you
p255
aVbut rather what's happened to you.
p256
aVAnd all the while, I listened to my voices,
p257
aVwith whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect
p258
aVand which in turn reflected a growing sense
p259
aVof compassion, acceptance and respect towards myself.
p260
aVAnd I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment
p261
aVwhen supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices,
p262
aVand becoming fully aware, for the very first time,
p263
aVthat I no longer felt that way myself
p264
aVbut was finally able to help someone else who was.
p265
aVI'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice,
p266
aVthe organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement,
p267
aVan initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme
p268
aVand Dr. Sandra Escher,
p269
aVwhich locates voice hearing as a survival strategy,
p270
aVa sane reaction to insane circumstances,
p271
aVnot as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured,
p272
aVbut a complex, significant and meaningful experience
p273
aVto be explored.
p274
aVTogether, we envisage and enact a society
p275
aVthat understands and respects voice hearing,
p276
aVsupports the needs of individuals who hear voices,
p277
aVand which values them as full citizens.
p278
aVThis type of society is not only possible,
p279
aVit's already on its way.
p280
aVTo paraphrase Chavez, once social change begins,
p281
aVit cannot be reversed.
p282
aVYou cannot humiliate the person who feels pride.
p283
aVYou cannot oppress the people
p284
aVwho are not afraid anymore.
p285
aVFor me, the achievements of the Hearing Voices Movement
p286
aVare a reminder that empathy, fellowship,
p287
aVjustice and respect are more than words;
p288
aVthey are convictions and beliefs,
p289
aVand that beliefs can change the world.
p290
aVIn the last 20 years, the Hearing Voices Movement
p291
aVhas established hearing voices networks
p292
aVin 26 countries across five continents,
p293
aVworking together to promote dignity, solidarity
p294
aVand empowerment for individuals in mental distress,
p295
aVto create a new language and practice of hope,
p296
aVwhich, at its very center, lies an unshakable belief
p297
aVin the power of the individual.
p298
aVAs Peter Levine has said, the human animal
p299
aVis a unique being
p300
aVendowed with an instinctual capacity to heal
p301
aVand the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity.
p302
aVIn this respect, for members of society,
p303
aVthere is no greater honor or privilege
p304
aVthan facilitating that process of healing for someone,
p305
aVto bear witness, to reach out a hand,
p306
aVto share the burden of someone's suffering,
p307
aVand to hold the hope for their recovery.
p308
aVAnd likewise, for survivors of distress and adversity,
p309
aVthat we remember we don't have to live our lives
p310
aVforever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us.
p311
aVWe are unique. We are irreplaceable.
p312
aVWhat lies within us can never be truly colonized,
p313
aVcontorted, or taken away.
p314
aVThe light never goes out.
p315
aVAs a very wonderful doctor once said to me,
p316
aV"Don't tell me what other people have told you about yourself.
p317
aVTell me about you."
p318
aVThank you.

VWhat I am always thinking about
p5
aVis what this session is about, which is called simplicity.
p6
aVAnd almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded,
p7
aVbut in the best sense of the word.
p8
aVI'm trying to figure out two very simple things:
p9
aVhow to live and how to die, period.
p10
aVThat's all I'm trying to do, all day long.
p11
aVAnd I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks,
p12
aVand, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things
p13
aVthat keep you grounded.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo, I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child.
p16
aVMy older sister was busy torturing my parents,
p17
aVand they were busy torturing her.
p18
aVI was lucky enough to be completely ignored,
p19
aVwhich is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.
p20
aVSo, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.
p21
aVAnd I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967,
p22
aVwhere I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.
p23
aVAnd I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.
p24
aVAnd feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretched
p25
aVfrom beginning to end.
p26
aVBut I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building,
p27
aVbut he went to Cuba.
p28
aVBut I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdale
p29
aVso I had more money than he did.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVAnd that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.
p32
aVBut, then he came back, and things happened,
p33
aVand I decided I really hated my writing,
p34
aVthat it was awful, awful, purple prose.
p35
aVAnd I decided that I wanted to tell \u2014
p36
aVbut I still wanted to tell a narrative story
p37
aVand I still wanted to tell my stories.
p38
aVSo I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?
p39
aVAnd so what happened was that I started
p40
aVjust becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know,
p41
aVsheer whatever, sheer ignorance.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd we started a studio.
p44
aVWell, Tibor really started the studio, called M&Co.
p45
aVAnd the premise of M&Co was, we don't know anything,
p46
aVbut that's all right, we're going to do it anyway.
p47
aVAnd as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything,
p48
aVbecause if you know too much, you're stymied.
p49
aVSo, the premise in the studio was,
p50
aVthere are no boundaries, there is no fear.
p51
aVAnd I \u2014 and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth,
p52
aVwas to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideas
p53
aVthat \u2014 fortunately, there were enough people there,
p54
aVand it was a team, it was a collective,
p55
aVit was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.
p56
aVBut the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.
p57
aVAnd so some of the things \u2014 I mean, it was a long history of M&Co,
p58
aVand clearly we also needed to make some money,
p59
aVso we decided we would create a series of products.
p60
aVAnd some of the watches there,
p61
aVattempting to be beautiful and humorous \u2014
p62
aVmaybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.
p63
aVThat to be able to talk about content,
p64
aVto break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise,
p65
aVelegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.
p66
aVIt was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in design
p67
aVand we wanted to say, the content is what's important,
p68
aVnot the package, not the wrapping.
p69
aVYou really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors,
p70
aVyou have to use your imagination more importantly than anything.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo, the good news is that I have a dog
p73
aVand, though I don't know if I believe in luck \u2014
p74
aVI don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question,
p75
aVbut I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.
p76
aVSo, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house,
p77
aVbecause everybody's always, you know, leaving,
p78
aVthey're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail,
p79
aVand he runs to the other room.
p80
aVBut I am able to make the transition from working for children and \u2014
p81
aVfrom working for adults to children, and back and forth,
p82
aVbecause, you know, I can say that I'm immature,
p83
aVand in a way, that's true.
p84
aVI don't really \u2014 I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand,
p85
aVI'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand
p86
aVlet's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.
p87
aVBut I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings
p88
aVand I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann's talk.
p89
aVAnd I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk.
p90
aVSo, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension \u2014
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aV\u2014 which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.
p93
aVSo, I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing
p94
aVand finding out something new.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.
p97
aVYou have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.
p98
aVAnd what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.
p99
aVAnd hopefully, you're not talking down to kids
p100
aVand you're not talking in such a way that you,
p101
aVyou know, couldn't stand reading it after one time.
p102
aVSo, I hopefully am writing, you know,
p103
aVbooks that are good for children and for adults.
p104
aVBut the painting reflects \u2014
p105
aVI don't think differently for children than I do for adults.
p106
aVI try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy,
p107
aVthe same kind of love of language.
p108
aVSo, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends.
p109
aa(lp110
VThis is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said,
p111
aV"You! Sit down there." You know, I take lots of photos.
p112
aVAnd the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.
p113
aVSo, I get to put in all of the things that I love.
p114
aVHopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels,
p115
aVand hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.
p116
aVAnd the books are really journals of my life.
p117
aVI never \u2014 I don't like plots.
p118
aVI don't know what a plot means.
p119
aVI can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning,
p120
aVyou know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me,
p121
aVbecause my life is too random and too confused,
p122
aVand I enjoy it that way.
p123
aa(lp124
VBut anyway, so we were in Venice,
p125
aVand this is our room. And I had this dream
p126
aVthat I was wearing this fantastic green gown,
p127
aVand I was looking out the window,
p128
aVand it was really a beautiful thing.
p129
aVAnd so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet,
p130
aVand hopefully go on to something else.
p131
aVThe letter C had other things in it.
p132
aVI was fortunate also, to meet the man who's sitting on the bed,
p133
aVthough I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair.
p134
aVWell, he has some hair but \u2014 well, he used to have hair.
p135
aVAnd with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.
p136
aVI work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened
p137
aVand it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx,
p140
aVand somebody said Bronxistan,
p141
aVand somebody said Ferreristan,
p142
aVand we came up with this New Yorker cover,
p143
aVwhich we were able to \u2014 we didn't know what we were doing.
p144
aVWe weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be \u2014
p145
aVwell, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.
p146
aVWe hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover,
p147
aVand we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened,
p148
aVwould be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.
p149
aVAnd it really became the \u2014 I don't know, you know,
p150
aVit was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.
p151
aVAnd from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know,
p152
aVfor the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know,
p153
aVwe were able to take the city
p154
aVand make fun of this completely foreign, who are \u2014 what's going on over here?
p155
aVWho are these people? What are these tribes?
p156
aVAnd David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it,
p157
aVhad one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers,
p158
aVbecause he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's.
p159
aVBut you know, we said, "David, who's going to know?
p160
aVThey're not."
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVSo it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.
p163
aVYou know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happen
p164
aVand that's kind of the beauty part.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd we were on Cape Cod, a place, obviously, of great inspiration,
p167
aVand I picked up this book, "The Elements of Style," at a yard sale.
p168
aVAnd I didn't \u2014 and I'd never used it in school,
p169
aVbecause I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out,
p170
aVand I don't know what, sitting in cafes.
p171
aVBut I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.
p172
aVI said, people should know about this book.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVSo I decided it needed a few \u2014 it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.
p175
aVAnd basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate,
p176
aVand what an intersection of like, you know,
p177
aVPolish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying,
p178
aVI'd like to do something to this book.
p179
aVAnd they said yes, and they left me completely alone,
p180
aVwhich was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.
p181
aVAnd I took the examples that they gave,
p182
aVand just did 56 paintings, basically.
p183
aVSo, this is, I don't know if you can read this.
p184
aV"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."
p185
aVAnd when you're dealing with grammar,
p186
aVwhich is, you know, incredibly dry,
p187
aVE.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical \u2014 and actually, Strunk \u2014
p188
aVand then you come to the rules and, you know,
p189
aVthere are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question?
p190
aVDo you mind my asking a question?"
p191
aV"Would, could, should, or would, should, could."
p192
aVAnd "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell,
p193
aVand "could" is an August Sander subject.
p194
aVAnd, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug."
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VSo, there's a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery theme
p198
aVthat I really love very much.
p199
aVAnd then, "Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand."
p200
aVE.B. White wrote us a number of rules,
p201
aVwhich can either paralyze you and make you loathe him
p202
aVfor the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do,
p203
aVor you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich.
p204
aVSo, what I did when I was painting was I started singing,
p205
aVbecause I really adore singing,
p206
aVand I think that music is the highest form of all art.
p207
aVSo, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly,
p208
aVwho wrote nine songs using the text,
p209
aVand we performed this fantastic evening of \u2014
p210
aVhe wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.
p211
aVI played the clattering teacup and the slinky
p212
aVin the main reading room of the New York Public Library,
p213
aVwhere you're supposed to be very, very quiet,
p214
aVand it was a phenomenally wonderful event,
p215
aVwhich we hopefully will do some more.
p216
aa(lp217
VWho knows? The New York TimesSelect, the op-ed page,
p218
aVasked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.
p219
aVSo, once a month for the last year,
p220
aVI've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty,"
p221
aVwhich, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is,
p222
aVbut I know I can throw that around now. You know,
p223
aVit's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.
p224
aVI'm going to read quickly \u2014 and probably I'm going to edit some,
p225
aVbecause I don't have that much time left \u2014 a few of the columns.
p226
aVAnd basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing,
p227
aVbecause I said, "Well, how much space do I have?"
p228
aVAnd they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet."
p229
aVAnd I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?"
p230
aVAnd they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited."
p231
aVOK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin.
p232
aV"How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?
p233
aVImpossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo."
p234
aVAnd I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct,
p235
aVand then I talk about Spinoza.
p236
aV"As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation
p237
aVfor everything, called eudaemonia.
p238
aVAnd then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him,
p239
aVand I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal."
p240
aVI happen to know it for a fact.
p241
aVAnd then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza,
p244
aVbut we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog,
p245
aVand I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.
p246
aVAnd there he is, with this horrible electrical box on his rump
p247
aVin this fantastic, decrepit palace.
p248
aV"And I think it must have been a very, very dark day
p249
aVwhen the Bolsheviks arrived.
p250
aVMaybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs,
p251
aVbut Stalin was a paranoid man, even more than my father."
p252
aV(Laughter)
p253
aVYou don't even know.
p254
aV"And decided his top people had to be extinctified."
p255
aVWhich I think I made up, which is a good thing.
p256
aVAnd so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart,
p257
aVbecause the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.
p258
aVSo, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away.
p259
aV"Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov,
p260
aVsitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair,
p261
aVleafing through a book and butterflies,
p262
aVimagine such displacement, such loss?"
p263
aVAnd then I want to tell you that this is a map.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo, "My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well.
p266
aVToo many pogroms.
p267
aVLeaving the shack, the wild blueberry woods, the geese, the River Sluch,
p268
aVthey went to Palestine and then America."
p269
aVAnd my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America,
p270
aVand that is my DNA over here, because that person who I grew up with
p271
aVhad no use for facts whatsoever.
p272
aVFacts were actually banished from our home.
p273
aVAnd so, if you see that Texas \u2014 you know, Texas and California
p274
aVare under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina,
p275
aVthis is the home that I grew up in, OK?
p276
aVSo, it's a miracle that I'm here today.
p277
aVBut actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing.
p278
aVBut then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin,
p279
aVwhich is the town they came from, and, "Sorry, the rest unknown, thank you."
p280
aVBut in her lexicon, "sorry, the rest unknown, thank you" is
p281
aV"sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell,"
p282
aVbecause she couldn't care less.
p283
aV(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
V"The Impossibility of February"
p286
aVis that February's a really wretched month in New York
p287
aVand the images for me conjure up these really awful things.
p288
aVWell, not so awful.
p289
aVI received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper
p290
aVand there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.
p291
aVAnd I say, "I hope he's not really dead,
p292
aVjust enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow,
p293
aVbut the caption says he is dead."
p294
aVAnd actually, he was. I think he's dead, though I don't know,
p295
aVmaybe he's not dead.
p296
aV"And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man,
p297
aVbut about all sad things. It happens quite often in February."
p298
aVThere's consoling.
p299
aVThis man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase,
p300
aVand basically \u2014 you know, I guess onions are a theme here.
p301
aVAnd he says, "It is impossible not to lie.
p302
aVIt is February and not lying is impossible."
p303
aVAnd I really spend a lot of time wondering,
p304
aVhow much truth do we tell?
p305
aVWhat is it that we're actually \u2014 what story are we actually telling?
p306
aVHow do we know when we are ourselves?
p307
aVHow do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths
p308
aVare real stories, you know, are real sentences?
p309
aVOr are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying?
p310
aa(lp311
VI'm going to quickly go through this.
p312
aVA quote by Bertrand Russell,
p313
aV"All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration,
p314
aVall the noonday brightness of human genius
p315
aVare destined to extinction.
p316
aVSo now, my friends, if that is true,
p317
aVand it is true, what is the point?"
p318
aVA complicated question.
p319
aVAnd so, you know, I talk to my friends
p320
aVand I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.
p321
aVOh my God, you know what?
p322
aVCould we have \u2014 no, we don't have time.
p323
aVI taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the \u2014
p324
aVyou know, could we have it for a second?
p325
aVDo you have that?
p326
aV(Music)
p327
aVOK. I taped my \u2014 my aunt used to swim in the ocean
p328
aVevery day of the year until she was about 85.
p329
aVSo \u2014 and that's a song about how everybody's miserable
p330
aVbecause, you know, we're from Russia.
p331
aV(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VI went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96,
p334
aVand when I brought her a copy of "The Elements of Style,"
p335
aVshe said she would treasure it.
p336
aVAnd then I said \u2014 oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said,
p337
aV"When you met him, you knew it was him."
p338
aVAnd she said, "I knew it was he."
p339
aV(Laughter)
p340
aVSo, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.
p341
aVAnd she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.
p342
aVGershwin died at the age of 38.
p343
aVHe's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.
p344
aVI don't want to talk about that now.
p345
aVI do want to talk \u2014 the absolute icing on this cemetery cake
p346
aVis the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.
p347
aVI think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.
p348
aV(Laughter)
p349
aVAnd I would like to run it for them.
p350
aVAnd I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise,
p351
aVwho's also still working, and I looked at her sink,
p352
aVwhich is really amazing, and left.
p353
aVAnd then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.
p354
aVAnd a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.
p355
aVAnd then I go and have some tea.
p356
aVAnd then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died,
p357
aVshe tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel.
p358
aV(Laughter)
p359
aVAnd I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I see
p360
aVthat Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz's father,
p361
aVa dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx,
p362
aVwon the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.
p363
aVThat's actually Hy.
p364
aVAnd I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit,
p365
aVand I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.
p366
aVAnd it says, "Ich habe genug," which is a Bach cantata,
p367
aVwhich I once thought meant "I've had it, I can't take it anymore,
p368
aVgive me a break," but I was wrong.
p369
aVIt means "I have enough." And that is utterly true.
p370
aVI happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.

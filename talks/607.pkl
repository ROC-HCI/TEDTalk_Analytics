VWell, this is 2009.
p5
aVAnd it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.
p6
aVAnd all over the world, eminent evolutionists
p7
aVare anxious to celebrate this.
p8
aVAnd what they're planning to do is to enlighten us
p9
aVon almost every aspect
p10
aVof Darwin and his life,
p11
aVand how he changed our thinking.
p12
aVI say almost every aspect,
p13
aVbecause there is one aspect of this story
p14
aVwhich they have thrown no light on.
p15
aVAnd they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it
p16
aVand to talk about something else.
p17
aVSo I'm going to talk about it.
p18
aVIt's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?
p19
aa(lp20
VWe get the geneticists keeping on telling us
p21
aVhow extremely closely we are related \u2014 hardly any genes of difference,
p22
aVvery, very closely related.
p23
aVAnd yet, when you look at the phenotypes,
p24
aVthere's a chimp, there's a man;
p25
aVthey're astoundingly different,
p26
aVno resemblance at all.
p27
aVI'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff
p28
aVabout culture or psychology, or behavior.
p29
aVI'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty,
p30
aVmeasurable physical differences.
p31
aVThey, that one,
p32
aVis hairy and walking on four legs.
p33
aVThat one is a naked biped. Why?
p34
aVI mean \u2014
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVif I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe
p37
aVthere's a reason for that.
p38
aVIf we changed so much, something must have happened.
p39
aVWhat happened?
p40
aa(lp41
VNow 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.
p42
aVEverybody knew the answer.
p43
aVThey knew what happened.
p44
aVThe ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;
p45
aVour ancestors went out onto the plain.
p46
aVThat explained everything.
p47
aVWe had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass,
p48
aVor to chase after animals,
p49
aVor to free our hands for weapons.
p50
aVAnd we got so overheated in the chase
p51
aVthat we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
p52
aVEverybody knew that, for generations.
p53
aa(lp54
VBut then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.
p55
aVThe paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely
p56
aVat the accompanying microfauna
p57
aVthat lived in the same time and place as the hominids.
p58
aVAnd they weren't savanna species.
p59
aVAnd they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.
p60
aVAnd then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze
p61
aVfossilized pollen.
p62
aVShock, horror.
p63
aVThe fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.
p64
aVSome of it even came from lianas,
p65
aVthose things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo we're left with a situation where
p68
aVwe know that our earliest ancestors
p69
aVwere moving around on four legs in the trees,
p70
aVbefore the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.
p71
aVThis is not something I've made up.
p72
aVIt's not a minority theory.
p73
aVEverybody agrees with it.
p74
aa(lp75
VProfessor Tobias came over from South Africa
p76
aVand spoke to University College London.
p77
aVHe said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years,
p78
aVforget about it. It was wrong.
p79
aVWe've got to go back to square one and start again."
p80
aVIt made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.
p81
aa(lp82
VI mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.
p83
aVYou've got this beautiful paradigm.
p84
aVYou've believed it through generations.
p85
aVNobody has questioned it.
p86
aVYou've been constructing fanciful things on top of it,
p87
aVrelying on it to be as solid as a rock.
p88
aVAnd now it's whipped away from under you.
p89
aVWhat do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?
p90
aa(lp91
VWell, we know the answer because
p92
aVThomas S. Kuhn
p93
aVwrote a seminal treatise
p94
aVabout this back in 1962.
p95
aVHe said what scientists do
p96
aVwhen a paradigm fails
p97
aVis, guess what \u2014 they carry on as if nothing had happened.
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVIf they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.
p100
aVSo they say, "Yes it's wrong,
p101
aVbut supposing it was right ..."
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVAnd the only other option open to them
p104
aVis to stop asking the questions.
p105
aVSo that is what they have done now.
p106
aVThat's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.
p107
aa(lp108
VSome of them have even elevated it into a principle.
p109
aVIt's what we ought to be doing.
p110
aVAaron Filler from Harvard said,
p111
aV"Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?
p112
aVI mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.
p113
aVAnd we just record what we see."
p114
aVCharles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!
p115
aVHe knew all about that kind of science.
p116
aVAnd he called it hypothesis-free science.
p117
aVAnd he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
p118
aVAnd if you're going to say,
p119
aV"I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures,"
p120
aVyou can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window,
p121
aVfor it's about nothing else but selective pressures.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd the irony of it is,
p124
aVthat this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse
p125
aVwhere we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.
p126
aVThere was one waiting in the wings.
p127
aVIt had been waiting there since 1960
p128
aVwhen Alister Hardy, a marine biologist,
p129
aVsaid, "I think what happened,
p130
aVperhaps our ancestors
p131
aVhad a more aquatic existence
p132
aVfor some of the time."
p133
aVHe kept it to himself for 30 years.
p134
aVBut then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.
p135
aVAll his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.
p136
aVYou've exposed us to public ridicule!
p137
aVYou must never do that again."
p138
aVAnd at that time, it became set in stone:
p139
aVthe aquatic theory should be dumped
p140
aVwith the UFOs and the yetis,
p141
aVas part of the lunatic fringe of science.
p142
aa(lp143
VWell I don't think that.
p144
aVI think that Hardy had a lot going for him.
p145
aVI'd like to talk about just a handful
p146
aVof what have been called the
p147
aVhallmarks of mankind,
p148
aVthe things that made us different from everybody else,
p149
aVand all our relatives.
p150
aVLet's look at our naked skin.
p151
aVIt's obvious that most of the things we think about
p152
aVthat have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair,
p153
aVare aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus,
p154
aVthe dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.
p155
aVAnd a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.
p156
aVAnd you're tempted to think, well perhaps,
p157
aVcould that be why we are naked?
p158
aa(lp159
VI suggested it and people said, "No no no.
p160
aVI mean, look at the elephant.
p161
aVYou've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?"
p162
aVSo back in 1982 I said,
p163
aV"Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor."
p164
aVPeals of merry laughter!
p165
aV"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?"
p166
aVBut by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.
p167
aVThis has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms
p168
aVhave aquatic ancestors.
p169
aVThe last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.
p170
aa(lp171
VLast year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros
p172
aVand said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."
p173
aVSo this is a close connection between nakedness and water.
p174
aVAs an absolute connection, it only works one way.
p175
aVYou can't say all aquatic animals are naked,
p176
aVbecause look at the sea otter.
p177
aVBut you can say
p178
aVthat every animal that has become naked
p179
aVhas been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime,
p180
aVor the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.
p181
aVThe only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat,
p182
aVwhich never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd take bipedality.
p185
aVHere you can't find anybody to compare it with,
p186
aVbecause we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.
p187
aVBut you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys
p188
aVare capable of walking on two legs,
p189
aVif they want to, for a short time.
p190
aVThere is only one circumstance in which they
p191
aValways, all of them, walk on two legs,
p192
aVand that is when they are wading through water.
p193
aVDo you think that's significant?
p194
aVDavid Attenborough thinks it's significant,
p195
aVas the possible beginning of our bipedalism.
p196
aa(lp197
VLook at the fat layer.
p198
aVWe have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:
p199
aVnothing in the least like that in any other primate.
p200
aVWhy should it be there?
p201
aVWell they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals,
p202
aVthe fat that in most land mammals
p203
aVis deposited inside the body wall,
p204
aVaround the kidneys and the intestines and so on,
p205
aVhas started to migrate to the outside,
p206
aVand spread out in a layer inside the skin.
p207
aVIn the whale it's complete:
p208
aVno fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.
p209
aVWe cannot avoid the suspicion
p210
aVthat in our case it's started to happen.
p211
aVWe have got skin lined with this layer.
p212
aVIt's the only possible explanation of why humans,
p213
aVif they're very unlucky,
p214
aVcan become grossly obese,
p215
aVin a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.
p216
aVSomething very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained.
p217
aa(lp218
VThe question of why we can speak.
p219
aVWe can speak.
p220
aVAnd the gorilla can't speak. Why?
p221
aVNothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that \u2014
p222
aVpurely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.
p223
aVYou can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.
p224
aVThe only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath
p225
aVare the diving animals and the diving birds.
p226
aVIt was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.
p229
aVTrying to imagine a diver
p230
aVdiving into water \u2014 hardly makes a splash.
p231
aVTry to imagine a gorilla
p232
aVperforming the same maneuver,
p233
aVand you can see that, compared with gorilla,
p234
aVwe are halfway to being shaped like a fish.
p235
aVI am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years,
p236
aVthis aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe,
p237
aVand it is not lunatic fringe.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd the ironic thing about it is that
p240
aVthey are not staving off the aquatic theory
p241
aVto protect a theory of their own,
p242
aVwhich they've all agreed on, and they love.
p243
aVThere is nothing there.
p244
aVThey are staving off the aquatic theory
p245
aVto protect a vacuum.
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aV(Applause)
p248
aa(lp249
VHow do they react when I say these things?
p250
aVOne very common reaction I've heard about 20 times
p251
aVis, "But it was investigated.
p252
aVThey conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning,
p253
aVwhen Hardy put forward his article."
p254
aVI don't believe it.
p255
aVFor 35 years I've been looking for any evidence
p256
aVof any incident of that kind,
p257
aVand I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.
p258
aVIt's never been done.
p259
aa(lp260
VI ask people sometimes, and they say,
p261
aV"I like the aquatic theory!
p262
aVEverybody likes the aquatic theory.
p263
aVOf course they don't believe it, but they like it."
p264
aVWell I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"
p265
aVThey say "Well ...
p266
aVeverybody I talk to says it's rubbish.
p267
aVAnd they can't all be wrong, can they?"
p268
aVThe answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong."
p269
aVHistory is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.
p270
aV(Applause)
p271
aVAnd if you've got a scientific problem like that,
p272
aVyou can't solve it by holding a head count,
p273
aVand saying, "More of us say yes than say no."
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VApart from that, some of the heads count more than others.
p278
aVSome of them have come over.
p279
aVThere was Professor Tobias. He's come over.
p280
aVDaniel Dennett, he's come over.
p281
aVSir David Attenborough, he's come over.
p282
aVAnybody else out there? Come on in.
p283
aVThe water is lovely.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd now we've got to look to the future.
p288
aVUltimately one of three things is going to happen.
p289
aVEither they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.
p290
aV"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting."
p291
aVThat would be very sad.
p292
aVThe second thing that could happen
p293
aVis that some young genius will arrive,
p294
aVand say, "I've found it.
p295
aVIt was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!"
p296
aVNo sign of that happening either.
p297
aVI don't think there is a third option.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo the third thing that might happen is
p300
aVa very beautiful thing.
p301
aVIf you look back at the early years of the last century,
p302
aVthere was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling
p303
aVbetween the believers in Mendel,
p304
aVand the believers in Darwin.
p305
aVIt ended with a new synthesis:
p306
aVDarwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas
p307
aVblending together.
p308
aVAnd I think the same thing will happen here.
p309
aVYou'll get a new synthesis.
p310
aVHardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas
p311
aVwill be blended together.
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd we can move forward from there,
p314
aVand really get somewhere.
p315
aVThat would be a beautiful thing.
p316
aVIt would be very nice for me if it happened soon.
p317
aV(Laughter)
p318
aVBecause I'm older now than George Burns was when he said,
p319
aV"At my age, I don't even buy green bananas."
p320
aa(lp321
V(Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VSo if it's going to come and it's going to happen,
p324
aVwhat's holding it up?
p325
aVI can tell you that in three words.
p326
aVAcademia says no.
p327
aVThey decided in 1960,
p328
aV"That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis."
p329
aVAnd it's not easy to change their minds.
p330
aVThe professional journals
p331
aVwon't touch it with a barge pole.
p332
aVThe textbooks don't mention it.
p333
aVThe syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked,
p334
aVlet alone look for a reason to it.
p335
aV"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics,
p336
aVwon't touch it with a barge pole.
p337
aVSo we never hear the case put for it,
p338
aVexcept in jocular references
p339
aVto people on the lunatic fringe.
p340
aa(lp341
VI don't know quite where this diktat comes from.
p342
aVSomebody up there
p343
aVis issuing the commandment,
p344
aV"Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.
p345
aVAnd if you hope to make progress in this profession,
p346
aVand you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself,
p347
aVbecause it will get in your way."
p348
aa(lp349
VSo I get the impression that some parts
p350
aVof the scientific establishment
p351
aVare morphing into a kind of priesthood.
p352
aVBut you know, that makes me feel good,
p353
aVbecause Richard Dawkins has told us
p354
aVhow to treat a priesthood.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aVHe says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it
p357
aVall the excessive awe and reverence
p358
aVit's been trained to receive."
p359
aVRight. I'll go ahead with that.
p360
aVAnd secondly, he says,
p361
aV"You must never be afraid to rock the boat."
p362
aVI'll go along with that too.
p363
aVThank you very much.
p364

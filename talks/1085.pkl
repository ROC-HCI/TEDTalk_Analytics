VTwo weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,
p5
aVand the phone rang and I heard,
p6
aV"Hey, JR,
p7
aVyou won the TED Prize 2011.
p8
aVYou have to make a wish to save the world."
p9
aVI was lost.
p10
aVI mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.
p11
aVThe world is fucked up.
p12
aVCome on, you have dictators ruling the world,
p13
aVpopulation is growing by millions,
p14
aVthere's no more fish in the sea,
p15
aVthe North Pole is melting
p16
aVand as the last TED Prize winner said,
p17
aVwe're all becoming fat.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVExcept maybe French people.
p20
aVWhatever.
p21
aVSo I called back
p22
aVand I told her,
p23
aV"Look, Amy,
p24
aVtell the TED guys I just won't show up.
p25
aVI can't do anything to save the world."
p26
aVShe said, "Hey, JR,
p27
aVyour wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."
p28
aV"Oh, all right."
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aV"That's cool."
p31
aVI mean, technology, politics, business
p32
aVdo change the world \u2014
p33
aVnot always in a good way, but they do.
p34
aVWhat about art?
p35
aVCould art change the world?
p36
aa(lp37
VI started when I was 15 years old.
p38
aVAnd at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.
p39
aVI was doing graffiti \u2014
p40
aVwriting my name everywhere,
p41
aVusing the city as a canvas.
p42
aVI was going in the tunnels of Paris,
p43
aVon the rooftops with my friends.
p44
aVEach trip was an excursion,
p45
aVwas an adventure.
p46
aVIt was like leaving our mark on society,
p47
aVto say, "I was here," on the top of a building.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo when I found a cheap camera on the subway,
p50
aVI started documenting those adventures with my friends
p51
aVand gave them back as photocopies \u2014
p52
aVreally small photos just that size.
p53
aVThat's how, at 17 years old,
p54
aVI started pasting them.
p55
aVAnd I did my first "expo de rue,"
p56
aVwhich means sidewalk gallery.
p57
aVAnd I framed it with color
p58
aVso you would not confuse it with advertising.
p59
aVI mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.
p60
aVI would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery
p61
aVand let them decide
p62
aVif my work was nice enough to show it to people.
p63
aVI would control it directly with the public
p64
aVin the streets.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo that's Paris.
p67
aVI would change \u2014
p68
aVdepending on the places I would go \u2014
p69
aVthe title of the exhibition.
p70
aVThat's on the Champs-Elysees.
p71
aVI was quite proud of that one.
p72
aVBecause I was just 18
p73
aVand I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.
p74
aVThen when the photo left,
p75
aVthe frame was still there.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VNovember 2005:
p80
aVthe streets are burning.
p81
aVA large wave of riots
p82
aVhad broken into the first projects of Paris.
p83
aVEveryone was glued to the TV,
p84
aVwatching disturbing, frightening images
p85
aVtaken from the edge of the neighborhood.
p86
aVI mean, these kids, without control,
p87
aVthrowing Molotov cocktails,
p88
aVattacking the cops and the firemen,
p89
aVlooting everything they could in the shops.
p90
aVThese were criminals, thugs, dangerous,
p91
aVdestroying their own environment.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd then I saw it \u2014 could it be possible? \u2014
p94
aVmy photo on a wall
p95
aVrevealed by a burning car \u2014
p96
aVa pasting I'd done a year earlier \u2014
p97
aVan illegal one \u2014 still there.
p98
aVI mean, these were the faces of my friends.
p99
aVI know those guys.
p100
aVAll of them are not angels,
p101
aVbut they're not monsters either.
p102
aVSo it was kind of weird to see
p103
aVthose images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo I went back there
p106
aVwith a 28 mm lens.
p107
aVIt was the only one I had at that time.
p108
aVBut with that lens,
p109
aVyou have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.
p110
aVSo you can do it only with their trust.
p111
aVSo I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.
p112
aVThey were making scary faces
p113
aVto play the caricature of themselves.
p114
aVAnd then I pasted huge posters everywhere
p115
aVin the bourgeois area of Paris
p116
aVwith the name, age, even building number
p117
aVof these guys.
p118
aVA year later,
p119
aVthe exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.
p120
aVAnd we go from thug images,
p121
aVwho've been stolen and distorted by the media,
p122
aVwho's now proudly taking over his own image.
p123
aVThat's where I realized
p124
aVthe power of paper and glue.
p125
aVSo could art change the world?
p126
aa(lp127
VA year later,
p128
aVI was listening to all the noise
p129
aVabout the Middle East conflict.
p130
aVI mean, at that time, trust me,
p131
aVthey were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.
p132
aVSo with my friend Marco,
p133
aVwe decided to go there
p134
aVand see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.
p135
aVAre they so different?
p136
aVWhen we got there, we just went in the street,
p137
aVstarted talking with people everywhere,
p138
aVand we realized that things were a bit different
p139
aVfrom the rhetoric we heard in the media.
p140
aVSo we decided to take portraits
p141
aVof Palestinians and Israelis
p142
aVdoing the same jobs \u2014
p143
aVtaxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.
p144
aVAsked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.
p145
aVNot a smile \u2014 that really doesn't tell
p146
aVabout who you are and what you feel.
p147
aVThey all accepted
p148
aVto be pasted next to the other.
p149
aVI decided to paste
p150
aVin eight Israeli and Palestinian cities
p151
aVand on both sides of the wall.
p152
aVWe launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.
p153
aVWe called the project Face 2 Face.
p154
aa(lp155
VThe experts said, "No way.
p156
aVThe people will not accept.
p157
aVThe army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."
p158
aVWe said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."
p159
aVI love the way that people will ask me,
p160
aV"How big will my photo be?"
p161
aV"It will be as big as your house."
p162
aVWhen we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.
p163
aVSo we arrived with just our ladders
p164
aVand we realized that they were not high enough.
p165
aVAnd so Palestinians guys say,
p166
aV"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."
p167
aVSo he went to the Church of Nativity
p168
aVand brought back an old ladder
p169
aVthat was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVWe did Face 2 Face with only six friends,
p172
aVtwo ladders, two brushes,
p173
aVa rented car, a camera
p174
aVand 20,000 square feet of paper.
p175
aVWe had all sorts of help
p176
aVfrom all walks of life.
p177
aa(lp178
VOkay, for example, that's Palestine.
p179
aVWe're in Ramallah right now.
p180
aVWe're pasting portraits \u2014
p181
aVso both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.
p182
aVPeople come around us and start asking,
p183
aV"What are you doing here?"
p184
aV"Oh, we're actually doing an art project
p185
aVand we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.
p186
aVAnd those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."
p187
aVAnd then there was always a silence.
p188
aV"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face \u2014
p189
aVdoing a face \u2014 right here?"
p190
aV"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."
p191
aVAnd I would always leave that moment,
p192
aVand we would ask them,
p193
aV"So can you tell me who is who?"
p194
aVAnd most of them couldn't say.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Applause)
p197
aa(lp198
VWe even pasted on Israeli military towers,
p199
aVand nothing happened.
p200
aVWhen you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.
p201
aVPeople can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it \u2014
p202
aVsome are a bit high for that, I agree \u2014
p203
aVbut the people in the street,
p204
aVthey are the curator.
p205
aVThe rain and the wind will take them off anyway.
p206
aVThey are not meant to stay.
p207
aVBut exactly four years after,
p208
aVthe photos, most of them are still there.
p209
aVFace 2 Face demonstrated
p210
aVthat what we thought impossible was possible \u2014
p211
aVand, you know what, even easy.
p212
aVWe didn't push the limit;
p213
aVwe just showed that they were further than anyone thought.
p214
aa(lp215
VIn the Middle East, I experienced my work
p216
aVin places without [many] museums.
p217
aVSo the reactions in the street
p218
aVwere kind of interesting.
p219
aVSo I decided to go further in this direction
p220
aVand go in places where there were zero museums.
p221
aVWhen you go in these developing societies,
p222
aVwomen are the pillars of their community,
p223
aVbut the men are still the ones holding the streets.
p224
aVSo we were inspired to create a project
p225
aVwhere men will pay tribute to women
p226
aVby posting their photos.
p227
aVI called that project Women Are Heroes.
p228
aVWhen I listened to all the stories
p229
aVeverywhere I went on the continents,
p230
aVI couldn't always understand
p231
aVthe complicated circumstances of their conflict.
p232
aVI just observed.
p233
aVSometimes there was no words,
p234
aVno sentence, just tears.
p235
aVI just took their pictures
p236
aVand pasted them.
p237
aa(lp238
VWomen Are Heroes took me around the world.
p239
aVMost of the places I went to,
p240
aVI decided to go there
p241
aVbecause I've heard about it through the media.
p242
aVSo for example, in June 2008,
p243
aVI was watching TV in Paris,
p244
aVand then I heard about this terrible thing
p245
aVthat happened in Rio de Janeiro \u2014
p246
aVthe first favela of Brazil named Providencia.
p247
aVThree kids \u2014 that was three students \u2014
p248
aVwere [detained] by the army
p249
aVbecause they were not carrying their papers.
p250
aVAnd the army took them,
p251
aVand instead of bringing them to the police station,
p252
aVthey brought them to an enemy favela
p253
aVwhere they get chopped into pieces.
p254
aVI was shocked.
p255
aVAll Brazil was shocked.
p256
aVI heard it was one of the most violent favelas,
p257
aVbecause the largest drug cartel controls it.
p258
aVSo I decided to go there.
p259
aa(lp260
VWhen I arrived \u2014
p261
aVI mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.
p262
aVThere was none in place \u2014 no association, no NGOs, nothing \u2014
p263
aVno eyewitnesses.
p264
aVSo we just walked around,
p265
aVand we met a woman,
p266
aVand I showed her my book.
p267
aVAnd she said, "You know what?
p268
aVWe're hungry for culture.
p269
aVWe need culture out there."
p270
aVSo I went out and I started with the kids.
p271
aVI just took a few photos of the kids,
p272
aVand the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.
p273
aVThe day after, I came back and they were already scratched.
p274
aVBut that's okay.
p275
aVI wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.
p276
aa(lp277
VThen the next day, I held a meeting on the main square
p278
aVand some women came.
p279
aVThey were all linked to the three kids that got killed.
p280
aVThere was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend \u2014
p281
aVthey all wanted to shout the story.
p282
aVAfter that day,
p283
aVeveryone in the favela gave me the green light.
p284
aVI took more photos, and we started the project.
p285
aVThe drug lords were kind of worried
p286
aVabout us filming in the place,
p287
aVso I told them, "You know what?
p288
aVI'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.
p289
aVYou see that enough in the media.
p290
aVWhat I want to show is the incredible life and energy.
p291
aVI've been seeing it around me the last few days."
p292
aVSo that's a really symbolic pasting,
p293
aVbecause that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.
p294
aVAnd that's where the three kids got arrested,
p295
aVand that's the grandmother of one of them.
p296
aVAnd on that stairs,
p297
aVthat's where the traffickers always stand
p298
aVand there's a lot of exchange of fire.
p299
aVEveryone there understood the project.
p300
aVAnd then we pasted everywhere \u2014 the whole hill.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VWhat was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.
p305
aVI mean, you should see that.
p306
aVThey would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter
p307
aVand then have a really long lens,
p308
aVand we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.
p309
aVAnd they would put a number: "Please call this number
p310
aVif you know what's going on in Providencia."
p311
aVWe just did a project and then left
p312
aVso the media wouldn't know.
p313
aVSo how can we know about the project?
p314
aVSo they had to go and find the women
p315
aVand get an explanation from them.
p316
aVSo you create a bridge between the media
p317
aVand the anonymous women.
p318
aa(lp319
VWe kept traveling.
p320
aVWe went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone,
p321
aVLiberia, Kenya.
p322
aVIn war-torn places like Monrovia,
p323
aVpeople come straight to you.
p324
aVI mean, they want to know what you're up to.
p325
aVThey kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?
p326
aVAre you an NGO? Are you the media?"
p327
aVArt. Just doing art.
p328
aVSome people question, "Why is it in black and white?
p329
aVDon't you have color in France?"
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aVOr they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"
p332
aVSome who understood the project would explain it to others.
p333
aVAnd to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say,
p334
aV"You know, you've been here for a few hours
p335
aVtrying to understand, discussing with your fellows.
p336
aVDuring that time, you haven't thought about
p337
aVwhat you're going to eat tomorrow.
p338
aVThis is art."
p339
aVI think it's people's curiosity
p340
aVthat motivates them
p341
aVto come into the projects.
p342
aVAnd then it becomes more.
p343
aVIt becomes a desire, a need, an armor.
p344
aVOn this bridge that's in Monrovia,
p345
aVex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait
p346
aVof a woman that might have been raped during the war.
p347
aVWomen are always the first ones targeted
p348
aVduring conflict.
p349
aa(lp350
VThis is Kibera, Kenya,
p351
aVone of the largest slums of Africa.
p352
aVYou might have seen images about the post-election violence
p353
aVthat happened there in 2008.
p354
aVThis time we covered the roofs of the houses,
p355
aVbut we didn't use paper,
p356
aVbecause paper doesn't prevent the rain
p357
aVfrom leaking inside the house \u2014
p358
aVvinyl does.
p359
aVThen art becomes useful.
p360
aVSo the people kept it.
p361
aVYou know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there,
p362
aVthere are so [many] houses inside.
p363
aVAnd I went there a few months ago \u2014
p364
aVphotos are still there \u2014 and it was missing a piece of the eye.
p365
aVSo I asked the people what happened.
p366
aV"Oh, that guy just moved."
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aVWhen the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke,
p369
aV"Now God can see me."
p370
aVWhen you look at Kibera now,
p371
aVthey look back.
p372
aa(lp373
VOkay, India.
p374
aVBefore I start that, just so you know,
p375
aVeach time we go to a place, we don't have authorization,
p376
aVso we set up like commandos \u2014
p377
aVwe're a group of friends who arrive there,
p378
aVand we try to paste on the walls.
p379
aVBut there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.
p380
aVIn India it was just impossible to paste.
p381
aVI heard culturally and because of the law,
p382
aVthey would just arrest us at the first pasting.
p383
aVSo we decided to paste white,
p384
aVwhite on the walls.
p385
aVSo imagine white guys pasting white papers.
p386
aVSo people would come to us and ask us,
p387
aV"Hey, what are you up to?"
p388
aV"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"
p389
aVOf course, they were confused.
p390
aVBut you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets,
p391
aVand the more dust you would have
p392
aVgoing up in the air,
p393
aVon the white paper you can almost see,
p394
aVbut there is this sticky part
p395
aVlike when you reverse a sticker.
p396
aVSo the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.
p397
aVSo we could just walk in the street during the next days
p398
aVand the photos would get revealed by themselves.
p399
aV(Applause)
p400
aVThank you.
p401
aVSo we didn't get caught this time.
p402
aa(lp403
VEach project \u2014 that's a film
p404
aVfrom Women Are Heroes.
p405
aV(Music)
p406
aVOkay.
p407
aVFor each project we do
p408
aVa film.
p409
aVAnd most of what you see \u2014 that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" \u2014
p410
aVits images, photography,
p411
aVtaken one after the other.
p412
aVAnd the photos kept traveling even without us.
p413
aV(Laughter)
p414
aV(Applause)
p415
aVHopefully, you'll see the film,
p416
aVand you'll understand the scope of the project
p417
aVand what the people felt when they saw those photos.
p418
aVBecause that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.
p419
aVBehind each image is a story.
p420
aa(lp421
VWomen Are Heroes created a new dynamic
p422
aVin each of the communities,
p423
aVand the women kept that dynamic after we left.
p424
aVFor example, we did books \u2014 not for sale \u2014
p425
aVthat all the community would get.
p426
aVBut to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.
p427
aVWe did that in most of the places.
p428
aVWe go back regularly.
p429
aVAnd so in Providencia, for example, in the favela,
p430
aVwe have a cultural center running there.
p431
aVIn Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.
p432
aVBecause of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project
p433
aVsaid, "Hey, what about my roof?"
p434
aVSo we decided to come the year after
p435
aVand keep doing the project.
p436
aa(lp437
VA really important point for me
p438
aVis that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.
p439
aVSo I have no responsibility
p440
aVto anyone but myself
p441
aVand the subjects.
p442
aV(Applause)
p443
aVAnd that is for me
p444
aVone of the more important things in the work.
p445
aVI think, today,
p446
aVas important as the result is the way you do things.
p447
aVAnd that has always been a central part of the work.
p448
aVAnd what's interesting is that fine line that I have
p449
aVwith images and advertising.
p450
aVWe just did some pasting in Los Angeles
p451
aVon another project in the last weeks.
p452
aVAnd I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.
p453
aVBut yesterday the city called them and said,
p454
aV"Look, you're going to have to tear it down.
p455
aVBecause this can be taken for advertising,
p456
aVand because of the law,
p457
aVit has to be taken down."
p458
aVBut tell me, advertising for what?
p459
aa(lp460
VThe people I photograph
p461
aVwere proud to participate in the project
p462
aVand to have their photo in the community.
p463
aVBut they asked me for a promise basically.
p464
aVThey asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you."
p465
aVSo I did. That's Paris.
p466
aVThat's Rio.
p467
aVIn each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.
p468
aVYou understand the full scope of the project.
p469
aVThat's London.
p470
aVNew York.
p471
aVAnd today, they are with you in Long Beach.
p472
aa(lp473
VAll right, recently I started a public art project
p474
aVwhere I don't use my artwork anymore.
p475
aVI use Man Ray, Helen Levitt,
p476
aVGiacomelli, other people's artwork.
p477
aVIt doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.
p478
aVThe importance is what you do
p479
aVwith the images,
p480
aVthe statement it makes where it's pasted.
p481
aVSo for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret
p482
aVin Switzerland
p483
aVa few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.
p484
aV(Applause)
p485
aVThis image of three men wearing gas masks
p486
aVwas taken in Chernobyl originally,
p487
aVand I pasted it in Southern Italy,
p488
aVwhere the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.
p489
aa(lp490
VIn some ways, art can change the world.
p491
aVArt is not supposed to change the world,
p492
aVto change practical things,
p493
aVbut to change perceptions.
p494
aVArt can change
p495
aVthe way we see the world.
p496
aVArt can create an analogy.
p497
aVActually the fact that art cannot change things
p498
aVmakes it a neutral place
p499
aVfor exchanges and discussions,
p500
aVand then enables you to change the world.
p501
aVWhen I do my work,
p502
aVI have two kinds of reactions.
p503
aVPeople say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.
p504
aVThey would be really useful."
p505
aVOr, "How can we help?"
p506
aVI presume that you belong to the second category,
p507
aVand that's good,
p508
aVbecause for that project,
p509
aVI'm going to ask you to take the photos
p510
aVand paste them.
p511
aa(lp512
VSo now my wish is:
p513
aV(mock drum roll)
p514
aV(Laughter)
p515
aVI wish for you to stand up
p516
aVfor what you care about
p517
aVby participating in a global art project,
p518
aVand together we'll turn the world inside out.
p519
aVAnd this starts right now.
p520
aVYes, everyone in the room.
p521
aVEveryone watching.
p522
aVI wanted that wish
p523
aVto actually start now.
p524
aVSo a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story
p525
aVor even your own photos \u2014
p526
aVtell me what you stand for.
p527
aVTake the photos, the portraits,
p528
aVupload it \u2014 I'll give you all the details \u2014
p529
aVand I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups
p530
aVand reveal things to the world.
p531
aVThe full data is on the website \u2014
p532
aVinsideoutproject.net \u2014
p533
aVthat is launching today.
p534
aa(lp535
VWhat we see changes who we are.
p536
aVWhen we act together,
p537
aVthe whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.
p538
aVSo I hope that, together, we'll create something
p539
aVthat the world will remember.
p540
aVAnd this starts right now and depends on you.
p541
aa(lp542
VThank you.
p543
aa(lp544
V(Applause)
p545
aa(lp546
VThank you.

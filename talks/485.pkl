VI\u2019m going around the world giving talks about Darwin,
p5
aVand usually what I\u2019m talking about
p6
aVis Darwin\u2019s strange inversion of reasoning.
p7
aVNow that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic,
p8
aVand this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you.
p9
aa(lp10
V"In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer;
p11
aVso that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system,
p12
aVthat, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine,
p13
aVit is not requisite to know how to make it.
p14
aVThis proposition will be found on careful examination to express,
p15
aVin condensed form, the essential purport of the Theory,
p16
aVand to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin\u2019s meaning;
p17
aVwho, by a strange inversion of reasoning,
p18
aVseems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified
p19
aVto take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill."
p20
aa(lp21
VExactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion.
p22
aVA creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it:
p23
aV"Test Two:
p24
aVDo you know of any building that didn\u2019t have a builder? Yes/No.
p25
aVDo you know of any painting that didn\u2019t have a painter? Yes/No.
p26
aVDo you know of any car that didn\u2019t have a maker? Yes/No.
p27
aVIf you answered 'Yes' for any of the above, give details."
p28
aa(lp29
VA-ha! I mean, it really is a strange inversion of reasoning.
p30
aVYou would have thought it stands to reason
p31
aVthat design requires an intelligent designer.
p32
aVBut Darwin shows that it\u2019s just false.
p33
aa(lp34
VToday, though, I\u2019m going to talk about Darwin\u2019s other strange inversion,
p35
aVwhich is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important.
p36
aVIt stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.
p37
aVGuys go for girls like this because they are sexy.
p38
aVWe adore babies because they\u2019re so cute.
p39
aVAnd, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny.
p40
aa(lp41
VThis is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.
p42
aVLet\u2019s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector,
p43
aVbecause sugar is high energy, and it\u2019s just been wired up to the preferer,
p44
aVto put it very crudely, and that\u2019s why we like sugar.
p45
aVHoney is sweet because we like it, not "we like it because honey is sweet."
p46
aVThere\u2019s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.
p47
aVIf you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind,
p48
aVyou wouldn\u2019t see why they tasted sweet.
p49
aVYou have to look in our brains to understand why they\u2019re sweet.
p50
aVSo if you think first there was sweetness,
p51
aVand then we evolved to like sweetness,
p52
aVyou\u2019ve got it backwards; that\u2019s just wrong. It\u2019s the other way round.
p53
aVSweetness was born with the wiring which evolved.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd there\u2019s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies.
p56
aVAnd it\u2019s a good thing that there isn\u2019t, because if there were,
p57
aVthen Mother Nature would have a problem:
p58
aVHow on earth do you get chimps to mate?
p59
aVNow you might think, ah, there\u2019s a solution: hallucinations.
p60
aVThat would be one way of doing it, but there\u2019s a quicker way.
p61
aVJust wire the chimps up to love that look,
p62
aVand apparently they do.
p63
aVThat\u2019s all there is to it.
p64
aVOver six million years, we and the chimps evolved our different ways.
p65
aVWe became bald-bodied, oddly enough;
p66
aVfor one reason or another, they didn\u2019t.
p67
aVIf we hadn\u2019t, then probably this would be the height of sexiness.
p68
aa(lp69
VOur sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food.
p70
aVIt wasn\u2019t designed for chocolate cake.
p71
aVChocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus.
p72
aVThe term is owed to Niko Tinbergen,
p73
aVwho did his famous experiments with gulls,
p74
aVwhere he found that that orange spot on the gull\u2019s beak \u2014
p75
aVif he made a bigger, oranger spot
p76
aVthe gull chicks would peck at it even harder.
p77
aVIt was a hyperstimulus for them, and they loved it.
p78
aVWhat we see with, say, chocolate cake
p79
aVis it\u2019s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring.
p80
aVAnd there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one.
p81
aVThere's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here\u2019s a pretty good example.
p84
aVIt\u2019s important that we love babies, and that we not be put off by, say, messy diapers.
p85
aVSo babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing, and they do.
p86
aVAnd, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers
p87
aVprefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby.
p88
aVSo nature works on many levels here.
p89
aVBut now, if babies didn\u2019t look the way they do \u2014 if babies looked like this,
p90
aVthat\u2019s what we would find adorable, that\u2019s what we would find \u2014
p91
aVwe would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that.
p92
aVThis is the strange inversion.
p93
aa(lp94
VWell now, finally what about funny. My answer is, it\u2019s the same story, the same story.
p95
aVThis is the hard one, the one that isn\u2019t obvious. That\u2019s why I leave it to the end.
p96
aVAnd I won\u2019t be able to say too much about it.
p97
aVBut you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done \u2014
p98
aVit\u2019s dirty work, somebody\u2019s got to do it \u2014
p99
aVis so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed.
p100
aVNow, I think we've found the answer \u2014 I and a few of my colleagues.
p101
aVIt\u2019s a neural system that\u2019s wired up to reward the brain
p102
aVfor doing a grubby clerical job.
p103
aVOur bumper sticker for this view is
p104
aVthat this is the joy of debugging.
p105
aVNow I\u2019m not going to have time to spell it all out,
p106
aVbut I\u2019ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward.
p107
aVAnd what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe
p108
aVby switching humor on and off, by turning the knob on a joke \u2014
p109
aVnow it\u2019s not funny ... oh, now it\u2019s funnier ...
p110
aVnow we\u2019ll turn a little bit more ... now it\u2019s not funny \u2014
p111
aVin this way, we can actually learn something
p112
aVabout the architecture of the brain,
p113
aVthe functional architecture of the brain.
p114
aa(lp115
VMatthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model.
p116
aVHe\u2019s a computer scientist, Reginald Adams a psychologist, and there I am,
p117
aVand we\u2019re putting this together into a book.
p118
aVThank you very much.

He argues that the brain&#39;s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness &mdash; isn&#39;t. His 2003 book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; explores how our brains evolved to give  us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006&#39;s  &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot; examines belief through the lens of biology.<br /><br />This mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished Dennett&#39;s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religion&#39;s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: &ldquo;If we don&#39;t understand religion, we&#39;re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennett&#39;s landmark books include <em>The Mind&#39;s I</em>, co-edited with Douglas Hofstaedter,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/consciousnessexplained\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/darwinsdangerousidea\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</em></a><em>. </em>Read an excerpt from his 2013 book, <a href=\\"http://geni.us/intuitionpumps\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Intuition Pumps</em></a>, in the <a href=\\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/19/daniel-dennett-intuition-pumps-thinking-extract\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Guardian</em> &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>", "slug": "dan_dennett", "whotheyare": "Dan Dennett argues that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes.", "whatotherssay": "Dan Dennett is our best current philosopher.

"middleinitial": "", "whylisten": "<p>One of our most important living philosophers, Dan Dennett is best known for his provocative and controversial arguments that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes in the brain. He argues that the brain&#39;s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness &mdash; isn&#39;t. His 2003 book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; explores how our brains evolved to give  us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006&#39;s  &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot; examines belief through the lens of biology.<br /><br />This mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished Dennett&#39;s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religion&#39;s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: &ldquo;If we don&#39;t understand religion, we&#39;re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennett&#39;s landmark books include <em>The Mind&#39;s I</em>, co-edited with Douglas Hofstaedter,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/consciousnessexplained\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/darwinsdangerousidea\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</em></a><em>. </em>Read an excerpt from his 2013 book, <a href=\\"http://geni.us/intuitionpumps\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Intuition Pumps</em></a>, in the <a href=\\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/19/daniel-dennett-intuition-pumps-thinking-extract\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Guardian</em> &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>", "slug": "dan_dennett", "whotheyare": "Dan Dennett argues that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes.", "whatotherssay": "Dan Dennett is our best current philosopher.

VIn this rather long sort of marathon presentation,
p5
aVI've tried to break it up into three parts:
p6
aVthe first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be
p7
aVa little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer
p8
aVand really address the qualities of the human interface.
p9
aVAnd these will be some simple design qualities
p10
aVand they will also be some qualities of, if you will,
p11
aVthe intelligence of interaction.
p12
aVThen the second part will really just be examples of new technologies \u2014
p13
aVnew media falling very much into that mold.
p14
aVAgain, I will go through them as fast as possible.
p15
aVAnd then the last one will be some examples
p16
aVI've been able to collect, which I think
p17
aVillustrate this at least as best I can, in the world of entertainment.
p18
aVPeople have this belief \u2014 and I share most of it \u2014
p19
aVthat we will be using the TV screens or their equivalents
p20
aVfor electronic books of the future. But then you think,
p21
aV"My God! What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV."
p22
aVWell, it doesn't have to be terrible.
p23
aVAnd that is a slide taken from a TV set
p24
aVand it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium,
p25
aVand it absolutely looks beautiful.
p26
aa(lp27
VWell, what's happened? How did people get into this mess?
p28
aVWhere you are now, all of a sudden,
p29
aVsitting in front of personal computers
p30
aVand video text \u2014 teletext systems,
p31
aVand somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen?
p32
aVWell, you have to remember that TV was designed
p33
aVto be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal.
p34
aVSo you get a 13-inch, 19-inch, whatever, TV,
p35
aVand then you should multiply that by eight
p36
aVand that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set.
p37
aVNow we've put people 18 inches in front of a TV,
p38
aVand all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen,
p39
aVall of a sudden, are staring you in the face:
p40
aVthe shadow mask, the scan lines, all of that.
p41
aVAnd they can be treated very easily;
p42
aVthere are actually ways of getting rid of them,
p43
aVthere are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures.
p44
aVI'm talking here a little bit about display technologies.
p45
aa(lp46
VLet me talk about how you might input information.
p47
aVAnd my favorite example is always fingers.
p48
aVI'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays.
p49
aVHigh-tech, high-touch. Isn't that what some of you said?
p50
aVIt's certainly a very important medium for input,
p51
aVand a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolution
p52
aVsort of stylus for inputting to a display.
p53
aVIn fact, they're not: it's really a very, very high-resolution input medium \u2014
p54
aVyou have to just do it twice, you have to touch the screen
p55
aVand then rotate your finger slightly \u2014
p56
aVand you can move a cursor with great accuracy.
p57
aVAnd so when you see on the market these systems
p58
aVthat have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution,
p59
aVit's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing.
p60
aVBut it, in some sense, misses the point:
p61
aVnamely, that fingers are a very, very high-resolution input medium.
p62
aVNow, what are some of the other advantages?
p63
aVWell, the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up,
p64
aVand people don't realize how important that is \u2014
p65
aVnot having to pick up your fingers to use them. (Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VWhen you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh \u2014
p68
aVand I will not criticize the mouse too much \u2014
p69
aVwhen you're typing \u2014 what you have \u2014 you want to now put something \u2014
p70
aVfirst of all, you've got to find the mouse.
p71
aVYou have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt,
p72
aVbut you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse,
p73
aVand you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit
p74
aVto see where the cursor is on the screen.
p75
aVAnd then when you finally see where it is,
p76
aVthen you've got to move it to get the cursor over there,
p77
aVand then \u2014 "Bang" \u2014 you've got to hit a button or do whatever.
p78
aVThat's four separate steps versus typing and then touching
p79
aVand typing and just doing it all in one motion \u2014
p80
aVor one-and-a-half, depending on how you want to count.
p81
aVAgain, what I'm trying to do is just illustrate
p82
aVthe kinds of problems that I think face the designers
p83
aVof new computer systems and entertainment systems
p84
aVand educational systems
p85
aVfrom the perspective of the quality of that interface.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd another advantage, of course, of using fingers is you have 10 of them.
p88
aVAnd we have never known how to do this technically,
p89
aVso this slide is a fake slide.
p90
aVWe never succeeded in using ten fingers,
p91
aVbut there are certain things you can do, obviously,
p92
aVwith more than one-finger input, which is rather fascinating.
p93
aVWhat we did stumble across was something ...
p94
aVAgain, which is typical of the computer field,
p95
aVis when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature.
p96
aVAnd maybe ... (Laughter)
p97
aVmaybe a mouse is a new kind of bug.
p98
aVBut the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays:
p99
aVwe wanted to be able to draw \u2014 you know, rub your finger
p100
aVacross the screen to input continuous points \u2014
p101
aVand there was just too much friction
p102
aVcreated between your finger and the glass \u2014
p103
aVif glass was the substrate, which it usually is.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo we found that that actually was a feature
p106
aVin the sense you could build a pressure-sensitive display.
p107
aVAnd when you touch it with your finger,
p108
aVyou can actually, then, introduce all the forces on the face of that screen,
p109
aVand that actually has a certain amount of value.
p110
aVLet me see if I can load another disc
p111
aVand show you, quickly, an example.
p112
aVNow, imagine a screen, which is not only touch-sensitive now,
p113
aVit's pressure-sensitive.
p114
aVAnd it's pressure-sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen \u2014
p115
aVX, Y, and Z at least in one direction;
p116
aVwe couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction.
p117
aVBut let me get rid of the slide,
p118
aVand let's see if this comes on.
p119
aVOK. So there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation.
p120
aVThe person's just, if you will, pushing on the screen to make a curve.
p121
aVBut this is the interesting part.
p122
aa(lp123
VI want to stop it for a second
p124
aVbecause the movie is very badly made.
p125
aVAnd the particular display was built about six years ago,
p126
aVand when we moved from one room to another room,
p127
aVa rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed.
p128
aVSo all we have is this record. (Laughter)
p129
aVBut imagine that screen having lots of objects on it
p130
aVand the person has touched an object \u2014
p131
aVone of N \u2014 like he did there, and then pushed on it.
p132
aVNow, imagine a program
p133
aVwhere some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light:
p134
aVone is an anvil on a fuzzy rug
p135
aVand the other one is a ping-pong ball on a sheet of glass.
p136
aVAnd when you touch it, you have to really push very hard
p137
aVto move that anvil across the screen,
p138
aVand yet you touch the ping-pong ball very lightly
p139
aVand it just scoots across the screen.
p140
aVAnd what you can do \u2014 oops, I didn't mean to do that \u2014
p141
aVwhat you can do is actually feed back to the user
p142
aVthe feeling of the physical properties.
p143
aVSo again, they don't have to be weight;
p144
aVthey could be a general trying to move troops,
p145
aVand he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat.
p146
aVIn fact, they funded it for that very reason.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VThe whole notion, then, is one that at the interface
p151
aVthere are physical properties in that transducer \u2014
p152
aVin this case it's pressure and touches \u2014
p153
aVthat allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before.
p154
aVSo it's not simply looking at the quality or, if you will, the luxury of that interface,
p155
aVbut it's actually looking at the idea
p156
aVof presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before.
p157
aVI want to move on to another example,
p158
aVwhich is one of a different sort, where we're trying to use computer
p159
aVand video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book.
p160
aVHere, the idea is that you're going to take this book,
p161
aVif you will, and it's going to come alive.
p162
aVYou're going to sort of breathe life into it.
p163
aVWe are so used to doing monologues.
p164
aVFilmmakers, for example, are the experts in monologue making:
p165
aVyou make a film and it has a well-formed beginning, middle and end,
p166
aVand in some sense the art of it is that.
p167
aVAnd you then say, "There's an opportunity
p168
aVfor making conversational movies." Well, what does that mean?
p169
aVAnd it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession
p170
aVand all the assumptions of that medium.
p171
aVSo, book writing is the same thing.
p172
aa(lp173
VWhat I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book
p174
aVwhere it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there,
p175
aVbut you have to keep a few things in mind.
p176
aVOne is that this book knows about itself.
p177
aVEach frame of the movie has information about itself.
p178
aVSo it knows, or at least there is computer-readable information
p179
aVin the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame.
p180
aVThat's one thing. The other is that you have to realize
p181
aVthat it is a random access medium,
p182
aVand you can, in fact, branch and expand and elaborate and shrink.
p183
aVAnd here \u2014 again, my favorite example \u2014 is the cookbook,
p184
aVthe "Larousse Gastronomique."
p185
aVAnd I think I use the example all too often,
p186
aVbut it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little
p187
aVencyclopedia-style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin,
p188
aVand you get to the end of the recipe and it says, "Cook until done."
p189
aVNow, that would be, if you will, the top green track,
p190
aVwhich doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for me
p191
aVor for somebody who isn't an expert, and say,
p192
aV"Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes."
p193
aVAnd then for a real beginner, you would go down even further
p194
aVand elaborate more \u2014 say, "Open the oven, preheat, wait for the light to go out,
p195
aVopen the door, don't leave it open too long,
p196
aVput the penguin in and shut the door ..." (Laughter) whatever.
p197
aVAnd that's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back.
p198
aa(lp199
VThat's one kind of use of random access.
p200
aVAnd the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways.
p201
aVIf you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question,
p202
aVthe last thing you do is repeat what you just said.
p203
aVYou try and think of a different way of saying the same thing,
p204
aVor if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style,
p205
aVthen you might say it in a way that you think
p206
aVwould have a good impedance match with that student.
p207
aVThere are all sorts of techniques you will use \u2014
p208
aVand again, this is a different kind of branching.
p209
aVSo, what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book,
p210
aVbut I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books
p211
aVbecause your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction
p212
aVand entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission.
p213
aVNow, I don't even know what vintage the transmission is,
p214
aVbut let me just show you very quickly some of it, and we'll move on.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Video) Narrator: And continue to get descriptions for each of these chapters.
p217
aVNicholas Negroponte: Now, this is his table of contents.
p218
aVJust a picture of the transmission, and as you rub your finger across the transmission
p219
aVit highlights the various parts.
p220
aa(lp221
VNarrator: When I find a chapter that I want to see,
p222
aVI just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read.
p223
aVThe words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words,
p224
aVso I can get a different definition by just touching the word,
p225
aVand the definition appears, superimposed over the illustration.
p226
aa(lp227
VNN: This is about the oil pan, or the oil filter and all that.
p228
aVThis is relatively important because it sets the page ...
p229
aa(lp230
VNarrator: This is another example of a page with glossary words
p231
aVhighlighted in red.
p232
aVI can get a definition of these words just by touching them,
p233
aVand the definition will appear in the illustration corner.
p234
aVI can get back to the illustration, but in this case it's not a single frame,
p235
aVbut it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair
p236
aVthat's described in the text.
p237
aVThe two-headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie
p238
aVat various speeds, in forward or reverse.
p239
aVAnd the movie is displayed as a full frame movie.
p240
aVI can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed.
p241
aVHere's another step-by-step procedure, only in this case \u2014
p242
aa(lp243
VNN: Okay, this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound-sync movies \u2014
p244
aVthis is text-sync movies, so as the movie plays, the text gets highlighted.
p245
aVWe highlight the text as we go through the movie.
p246
aVRepairman: ... Not too far out. Front poles, preferably.
p247
aVDon't loosen them too far. If you loosen them too far, you'll have a big mess.
p248
aVNN: I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VOK. I'm at the third and last part of this,
p253
aVwhich I said I would make an attempt to at least give you some examples
p254
aVthat may be more directly related to the world of entertainment.
p255
aVAnd of course, good education has got to be good entertainment,
p256
aVso my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment
p257
aVthat we've been doing \u2014 in this case, in Senegal \u2014
p258
aVwhere we have tried to use personal computers
p259
aVas a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all;
p260
aVthe whole notion is to use this as an instrument
p261
aVwhere there is a complete reversal of roles \u2014
p262
aVthe child is, if you will, the teacher and the machine is the student \u2014
p263
aVand the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of
p264
aVapproximates thinking about thinking.
p265
aVBut teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant.
p266
aVAnd there are just a few slides I want to go through,
p267
aa(lp268
Vbut there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when,
p269
aVbefore we did this in any developing countries \u2014
p270
aVwe're doing it, in fact, in three developing countries right now:
p271
aVPakistan, Colombia and Senegal \u2014
p272
aVwe did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City.
p273
aVAnd one child, whose name I've forgotten, was about seven or eight years old,
p274
aVabsolutely considered mentally handicapped \u2014
p275
aVcouldn't read, didn't even make it in the lowest section of the school's classes \u2014
p276
aVand was pretty much not in school, though physically there.
p277
aVBut did hang around the, quote, "computer room,"
p278
aVwhere there were quite a few computers,
p279
aVand learned this particular language called Logo \u2014
p280
aVand learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun,
p281
aVit was very interesting. And one day, by chance,
p282
aVsome visitors from the NIE came by in their double-breasted suits
p283
aVlooking at this setup, and none of the children who were normally there,
p284
aVexcept for this one child, were there.
p285
aa(lp286
VHe was, and he said, "Let me show you how this works,"
p287
aVand they got an absolutely ingenuous, wonderful description of Logo.
p288
aVAnd the child was just zipping right through it, showing them all sorts of things
p289
aVuntil they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explain
p290
aVand so he flipped through the manual, found the explanation
p291
aVand typed the command and got it to do what they asked.
p292
aVThey were delighted, and by the time it was time to go see the principal,
p293
aVwhom they'd actually come to see \u2014 not the computer room \u2014
p294
aVthey went upstairs and they said,
p295
aV"This is absolutely remarkable!
p296
aVThat child was very articulate and showed us
p297
aVand even dealt with the things he couldn't do automatically
p298
aVwith that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic."
p299
aa(lp300
VThe principal said, "There's a dreadful mistake,
p301
aVbecause that child can't read.
p302
aVAnd you obviously have been hoodwinked
p303
aVor you've talked about somebody else."
p304
aVAnd they all got up and they all went downstairs
p305
aVand the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent:
p306
aVthey asked the child, "Can you read?"
p307
aVAnd the child said, "No, I can't."
p308
aVAnd then they said, "But wait a minute. You
p309
aVjust looked through that manual and you found ... "
p310
aVand he said, "Oh, but that's not reading."
p311
aVAnd so they said, "Well, what's reading then?"
p312
aVHe says, "Well, reading is this junk they give me in little books to read.
p313
aVIt's absolutely irrelevant, (Laughter) and I get nothing for it.
p314
aVBut here, with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return."
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd it really meant something to the child.
p317
aVThe child read beautifully, it turned out,
p318
aVand was really very competent. So it actually meant something.
p319
aVAnd that story has many other anecdotes that are similar,
p320
aVbut wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there,
p321
aVand it is: when does it mean something to a child?
p322
aVThere is a myth, and it truly is a myth:
p323
aVwe believe \u2014 and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room \u2014
p324
aVthat it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak.
p325
aVAnd it's not, but we think speech \u2014 "My God, little children pick it up somehow,
p326
aVand by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job,
p327
aVand by three and four they're speaking reasonably well.
p328
aVAnd yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read,
p329
aVand you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you.
p330
aVHence, it must be harder." Well, it's not harder.
p331
aVWhat the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child;
p332
aVthe child can get a great deal by talking to you.
p333
aa(lp334
VReading and writing is utterly useless.
p335
aVThere is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith,
p336
aVand that it's going to help you. (Laughter)
p337
aVSo what happens is you go to school and people say,
p338
aV"Just believe me, you're going to like it.
p339
aVYou're going to like reading," and just read and read.
p340
aVOn the other hand, you give a kid \u2014 a three-year-old kid \u2014 a computer
p341
aVand they type a little command and \u2014 Poof! \u2014 something happens.
p342
aVAnd all of a sudden ... You may not call that reading and writing,
p343
aVbut a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen
p344
aVhas a huge payoff, and it's a lot of fun.
p345
aVAnd in fact, it's a powerful educational instrument.
p346
aVWell, in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom:
p347
aV120 kids \u2014 three per desk \u2014 one teacher, a little bit of chalk.
p348
aVThis student was one of our first students,
p349
aVand it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard,
p350
aVand she came ... within two days \u2014
p351
aVI want to show you the program she wrote,
p352
aVand remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made.
p353
aa(lp354
VThat's what meant something to her, is doing the hair pattern,
p355
aVand actually did it within two days \u2014 an hour each day \u2014
p356
aVand found it was, to her,
p357
aVabsolutely the most meaningful piece ...
p358
aVBut rooted in that, little did she know how much knowledge
p359
aVshe was acquiring about geometry
p360
aVand just math and logic and all the rest.
p361
aVAnd again, I could talk for three hours about this subject.
p362
aVI will come to my last example and then quit.
p363
aVAnd my last example \u2014 as some of my former colleagues,
p364
aVwhom I see in the room, can imagine what it will be.
p365
aVYes, it is. It's our work \u2014 that was a while ago,
p366
aVand it still is my favorite project \u2014 of teleconferencing.
p367
aVAnd the reason it remains a favorite project
p368
aVis that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system
p369
aVwhere you had the following situation:
p370
aVyou had five people at five different sites \u2014 they were known people \u2014
p371
aVand you had to have these people in teleconference,
p372
aVsuch that each one was utterly convinced
p373
aVthat the other four were physically present.
p374
aVNow, that is sufficiently
p375
aVzany that we would, obviously, jump to the bait, and we did.
p376
aVAnd the fact that we knew the people \u2014
p377
aVwe had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney \u2014
p378
aVwe actually went so far as to build CRTs
p379
aVin the shapes of the people's faces.
p380
aVSo if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone,
p381
aVmy secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk,
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
Vand that would be the TV used for the occasion.
p386
aVAnd it's uncanny: there's no way I can explain to you
p387
aVthe amount of eye contact you get with that physical face
p388
aVprojected on a 3D CRT of that sort.
p389
aVThe next thing that we had to do is to persuade them
p390
aVthat there needed to be spatial correspondence, which is straightforward,
p391
aVbut again, it's something that didn't fall naturally
p392
aVout of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking;
p393
aVit was a very, if you will, architectural or spatial concept.
p394
aVAnd that was to recognize that when you sit around the table,
p395
aVthe actual location of the people becomes rather important.
p396
aVAnd when somebody gets up, in fact, to go answer a phone
p397
aVor use a bathroom or something, the empty seat becomes,
p398
aVif you will, that person. And you point frequently to the empty seat
p399
aVand you say, "He or she wouldn't agree,"
p400
aVand the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial.
p401
aVSo we said, "Well, these will be on round tables
p402
aVand the order around the table had to be the same,
p403
aVso that at my site, I would be, if you will, real
p404
aVand then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads.
p405
aVAnd the plastic heads, sometimes you want to project them.
p406
aVAnd there are a number of schemes, which I don't want to dwell on,
p407
aa(lp408
Vbut this is the one that we finally used
p409
aVwhere we projected onto rear screen material
p410
aVthat was molded in the face \u2014 literally in the face of the person.
p411
aVAnd I'll show you one more slide, where this is actually made
p412
aVfrom something called a solid photograph and is the screen.
p413
aVNow, we track, on the person's head, the head motions \u2014
p414
aVso we transmit with a video the head positions \u2014
p415
aVand so this head moves in about two axes.
p416
aVSo if I, all of a sudden, turn to the person to my left
p417
aVand start talking to that person, then at the person to my right's site,
p418
aVhe'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other.
p419
aVAnd then if that person interrupts, then those two heads may turn.
p420
aVAnd it really is reconstructing, quite accurately, teleconferencing.

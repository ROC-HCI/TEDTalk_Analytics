VI want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth.
p5
aVThink of the planet like a human body that we inhabit.
p6
aVThe skeleton is the transportation system of roads and railways,
p7
aVbridges and tunnels, air and seaports
p8
aVthat enable our mobility across the continents.
p9
aVThe vascular system that powers the body
p10
aVare the oil and gas pipelines and electricity grids.
p11
aVthat distribute energy.
p12
aVAnd the nervous system of communications
p13
aVis the Internet cables, satellites, cellular networks
p14
aVand data centers that allow us to share information.
p15
aa(lp16
VThis ever-expanding infrastructural matrix
p17
aValready consists of 64 million kilometers of roads,
p18
aVfour million kilometers of railways,
p19
aVtwo million kilometers of pipelines
p20
aVand one million kilometers of Internet cables.
p21
aVWhat about international borders?
p22
aVWe have less than 500,000 kilometers of borders.
p23
aa(lp24
VLet's build a better map of the world.
p25
aVAnd we can start by overcoming some ancient mythology.
p26
aVThere's a saying with which all students of history are familiar:
p27
aV"Geography is destiny."
p28
aVSounds so grave, doesn't it?
p29
aVIt's such a fatalistic adage.
p30
aVIt tells us that landlocked countries are condemned to be poor,
p31
aVthat small countries cannot escape their larger neighbors,
p32
aVthat vast distances are insurmountable.
p33
aVBut every journey I take around the world,
p34
aVI see an even greater force sweeping the planet:
p35
aVconnectivity.
p36
aa(lp37
VThe global connectivity revolution, in all of its forms \u2014
p38
aVtransportation, energy and communications \u2014
p39
aVhas enabled such a quantum leap in the mobility of people,
p40
aVof goods, of resources, of knowledge,
p41
aVsuch that we can no longer even think of geography as distinct from it.
p42
aVIn fact, I view the two forces as fusing together
p43
aVinto what I call "connectography."
p44
aa(lp45
VConnectography represents a quantum leap
p46
aVin the mobility of people, resources and ideas,
p47
aVbut it is an evolution,
p48
aVan evolution of the world from political geography,
p49
aVwhich is how we legally divide the world,
p50
aVto functional geography,
p51
aVwhich is how we actually use the world,
p52
aVfrom nations and borders, to infrastructure and supply chains.
p53
aa(lp54
VOur global system is evolving
p55
aVfrom the vertically integrated empires of the 19th century,
p56
aVthrough the horizontally interdependent nations of the 20th century,
p57
aVinto a global network civilization in the 21st century.
p58
aVConnectivity, not sovereignty,
p59
aVhas become the organizing principle of the human species.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Applause)
p62
aa(lp63
VWe are becoming this global network civilization
p64
aVbecause we are literally building it.
p65
aVAll of the world's defense budgets and military spending taken together
p66
aVtotal just under two trillion dollars per year.
p67
aVMeanwhile, our global infrastructure spending
p68
aVis projected to rise to nine trillion dollars per year
p69
aVwithin the coming decade.
p70
aVAnd, well, it should.
p71
aVWe have been living off an infrastructure stock
p72
aVmeant for a world population of three billion,
p73
aVas our population has crossed seven billion to eight billion
p74
aVand eventually nine billion and more.
p75
aVAs a rule of thumb, we should spend about one trillion dollars
p76
aVon the basic infrastructure needs of every billion people in the world.
p77
aa(lp78
VNot surprisingly, Asia is in the lead.
p79
aVIn 2015, China announced the creation
p80
aVof the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,
p81
aVwhich together with a network of other organizations
p82
aVaims to construct a network of iron and silk roads,
p83
aVstretching from Shanghai to Lisbon.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd as all of this topographical engineering unfolds,
p86
aVwe will likely spend more on infrastructure in the next 40 years,
p87
aVwe will build more infrastructure in the next 40 years,
p88
aVthan we have in the past 4,000 years.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow let's stop and think about it for a minute.
p91
aVSpending so much more on building the foundations of global society
p92
aVrather than on the tools to destroy it
p93
aVcan have profound consequences.
p94
aVConnectivity is how we optimize the distribution
p95
aVof people and resources around the world.
p96
aVIt is how mankind comes to be more than just the sum of its parts.
p97
aVI believe that is what is happening.
p98
aa(lp99
VConnectivity has a twin megatrend in the 21st century:
p100
aVplanetary urbanization.
p101
aVCities are the infrastructures that most define us.
p102
aVBy 2030, more than two thirds of the world's population
p103
aVwill live in cities.
p104
aVAnd these are not mere little dots on the map,
p105
aVbut they are vast archipelagos stretching hundreds of kilometers.
p106
aa(lp107
VHere we are in Vancouver,
p108
aVat the head of the Cascadia Corridor
p109
aVthat stretches south across the US border to Seattle.
p110
aVThe technology powerhouse of Silicon Valley
p111
aVbegins north of San Francisco down to San Jose
p112
aVand across the bay to Oakland.
p113
aVThe sprawl of Los Angeles now passes San Diego
p114
aVacross the Mexican border to Tijuana.
p115
aVSan Diego and Tijuana now share an airport terminal
p116
aVwhere you can exit into either country.
p117
aVEventually, a high-speed rail network may connect the entire Pacific spine.
p118
aVAmerica's northeastern megalopolis begins in Boston through New York
p119
aVand Philadelphia to Washington.
p120
aVIt contains more than 50 million people
p121
aVand also has plans for a high-speed rail network.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut Asia is where we really see the megacities coming together.
p124
aVThis continuous strip of light from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka
p125
aVcontains more than 80 million people
p126
aVand most of Japan's economy.
p127
aVIt is the world's largest megacity.
p128
aVFor now.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut in China, megacity clusters are coming together
p131
aVwith populations reaching 100 million people.
p132
aVThe Bohai Rim around Beijing,
p133
aVThe Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai
p134
aVand the Pearl River Delta,
p135
aVstretching from Hong Kong north to Guangzhou.
p136
aVAnd in the middle,
p137
aVthe Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster,
p138
aVwhose geographic footprint is almost the same size
p139
aVas the country of Austria.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd any number of these megacity clusters
p142
aVhas a GDP approaching two trillion dollars \u2014
p143
aVthat's almost the same as all of India today.
p144
aVSo imagine if our global diplomatic institutions, such as the G20,
p145
aVwere to base their membership on economic size
p146
aVrather than national representation.
p147
aVSome Chinese megacities may be in and have a seat at the table,
p148
aVwhile entire countries, like Argentina or Indonesia would be out.
p149
aa(lp150
VMoving to India, whose population will soon exceed that of China,
p151
aVit too has a number of megacity clusters,
p152
aVsuch as the Delhi Capital Region
p153
aVand Mumbai.
p154
aVIn the Middle East,
p155
aVGreater Tehran is absorbing one third of Iran's population.
p156
aVMost of Egypt's 80 million people
p157
aVlive in the corridor between Cairo and Alexandria.
p158
aVAnd in the gulf, a necklace of city-states is forming,
p159
aVfrom Bahrain and Qatar,
p160
aVthrough the United Arab Emirates to Muscat in Oman.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd then there's Lagos,
p163
aVAfrica's largest city and Nigeria's commercial hub.
p164
aVIt has plans for a rail network
p165
aVthat will make it the anchor of a vast Atlantic coastal corridor,
p166
aVstretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana,
p167
aVto Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut these countries are suburbs of Lagos.
p170
aVIn a megacity world,
p171
aVcountries can be suburbs of cities.
p172
aVBy 2030, we will have as many as 50 such megacity clusters in the world.
p173
aVSo which map tells you more?
p174
aVOur traditional map of 200 discrete nations
p175
aVthat hang on most of our walls,
p176
aVor this map of the 50 megacity clusters?
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd yet, even this is incomplete
p179
aVbecause you cannot understand any individual megacity
p180
aVwithout understanding its connections to the others.
p181
aVPeople move to cities to be connected,
p182
aVand connectivity is why these cities thrive.
p183
aVAny number of them, such as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow,
p184
aVhas a GDP approaching or exceeding one third of one half
p185
aVof their entire national GDP.
p186
aa(lp187
VBut equally importantly,
p188
aVyou cannot calculate any of their individual value
p189
aVwithout understanding the role of the flows of people,
p190
aVof finance, of technology
p191
aVthat enable them to thrive.
p192
aVTake the Gauteng province of South Africa,
p193
aVwhich contains Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria.
p194
aVIt too represents just over a third of South Africa's GDP.
p195
aVBut equally importantly, it is home to the offices
p196
aVof almost every single multinational corporation
p197
aVthat invests directly into South Africa
p198
aVand indeed, into the entire African continent.
p199
aa(lp200
VCities want to be part of global value chains.
p201
aVThey want to be part of this global division of labor.
p202
aVThat is how cities think.
p203
aVI've never met a mayor who said to me,
p204
aV"I want my city to be cut off."
p205
aVThey know that their cities belong as much
p206
aVto the global network civilization as to their home countries.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow, for many people, urbanization causes great dismay.
p209
aVThey think cities are wrecking the planet.
p210
aVBut right now,
p211
aVthere are more than 200 intercity learning networks thriving.
p212
aVThat is as many as the number of intergovernmental organizations
p213
aVthat we have.
p214
aVAnd all of these intercity networks are devoted to one purpose,
p215
aVmankind's number one priority in the 21st century:
p216
aVsustainable urbanization.
p217
aa(lp218
VIs it working?
p219
aVLet's take climate change.
p220
aVWe know that summit after summit in New York and Paris
p221
aVis not going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
p222
aVBut what we can see is that transferring technology
p223
aVand knowledge and policies between cities
p224
aVis how we've actually begun to reduce the carbon intensity of our economies.
p225
aa(lp226
VCities are learning from each other.
p227
aVHow to install zero-emissions buildings,
p228
aVhow to deploy electric car-sharing systems.
p229
aVIn major Chinese cities,
p230
aVthey're imposing quotas on the number of cars on the streets.
p231
aVIn many Western cities,
p232
aVyoung people don't even want to drive anymore.
p233
aVCities have been part of the problem,
p234
aVnow they are part of the solution.
p235
aa(lp236
VInequality is the other great challenge to achieving sustainable urbanization.
p237
aVWhen I travel through megacities from end to end \u2014
p238
aVit takes hours and days \u2014
p239
aVI experience the tragedy of extreme disparity
p240
aVwithin the same geography.
p241
aVAnd yet, our global stock of financial assets
p242
aVhas never been larger,
p243
aVapproaching 300 trillion dollars.
p244
aVThat's almost four times the actual GDP of the world.
p245
aa(lp246
VWe have taken on such enormous debts since the financial crisis,
p247
aVbut have we invested them in inclusive growth?
p248
aVNo, not yet.
p249
aVOnly when we build sufficient, affordable public housing,
p250
aVwhen we invest in robust transportation networks
p251
aVto allow people to connect to each other both physically and digitally,
p252
aVthat's when our divided cities and societies
p253
aVwill come to feel whole again.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Applause)
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd that is why infrastructure has just been included
p258
aVin the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,
p259
aVbecause it enables all the others.
p260
aVOur political and economic leaders
p261
aVare learning that connectivity is not charity,
p262
aVit's opportunity.
p263
aVAnd that's why our financial community needs to understand
p264
aVthat connectivity is the most important asset class of the 21st century.
p265
aa(lp266
VNow, cities can make the world more sustainable,
p267
aVthey can make the world more equitable,
p268
aVI also believe that connectivity between cities
p269
aVcan make the world more peaceful.
p270
aVIf we look at regions of the world with dense relations across borders,
p271
aVwe see more trade, more investment
p272
aVand more stability.
p273
aVWe all know the story of Europe after World War II,
p274
aVwhere industrial integration kicked off a process
p275
aVthat gave rise to today's peaceful European Union.
p276
aVAnd you can see that Russia, by the way,
p277
aVis the least connected of major powers in the international system.
p278
aVAnd that goes a long way towards explaining the tensions today.
p279
aVCountries that have less stake in the system
p280
aValso have less to lose in disturbing it.
p281
aVIn North America, the lines that matter most on the map
p282
aVare not the US-Canada border or the US-Mexico border,
p283
aVbut the dense network of roads and railways and pipelines
p284
aVand electricity grids and even water canals
p285
aVthat are forming an integrated North American union.
p286
aVNorth America does not need more walls, it needs more connections.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VBut the real promise of connectivity is in the postcolonial world.
p291
aVAll of those regions where borders have historically been the most arbitrary
p292
aVand where generations of leaders
p293
aVhave had hostile relations with each other.
p294
aVBut now a new group of leaders has come into power
p295
aVand is burying the hatchet.
p296
aa(lp297
VLet's take Southeast Asia, where high-speed rail networks
p298
aVare planned to connect Bangkok to Singapore
p299
aVand trade corridors from Vietnam to Myanmar.
p300
aVNow this region of 600 million people coordinates its agricultural resources
p301
aVand its industrial output.
p302
aVIt is evolving into what I call a Pax Asiana,
p303
aVa peace among Southeast Asian nations.
p304
aa(lp305
VA similar phenomenon is underway in East Africa,
p306
aVwhere a half dozen countries
p307
aVare investing in railways and multimodal corridors
p308
aVso that landlocked countries can get their goods to market.
p309
aVNow these countries coordinate their utilities
p310
aVand their investment policies.
p311
aVThey, too, are evolving into a Pax Africana.
p312
aa(lp313
VOne region we know could especially use this kind of thinking
p314
aVis the Middle East.
p315
aVAs Arab states tragically collapse,
p316
aVwhat is left behind but the ancient cities,
p317
aVsuch as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad?
p318
aVIn fact, the nearly 400 million people of the Arab world
p319
aVare almost entirely urbanized.
p320
aVAs societies, as cities,
p321
aVthey are either water rich or water poor,
p322
aVenergy rich or energy poor.
p323
aVAnd the only way to correct these mismatches
p324
aVis not through more wars and more borders,
p325
aVbut through more connectivity of pipelines and water canals.
p326
aVSadly, this is not yet the map of the Middle East.
p327
aVBut it should be,
p328
aVa connected Pax Arabia,
p329
aVinternally integrated
p330
aVand productively connected to its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa.
p331
aa(lp332
VNow, it may not seem like connectivity is what we want right now
p333
aVtowards the world's most turbulent region.
p334
aVBut we know from history that more connectivity is the only way
p335
aVto bring about stability in the long run.
p336
aVBecause we know that in region after region,
p337
aVconnectivity is the new reality.
p338
aVCities and countries are learning to aggregate
p339
aVinto more peaceful and prosperous wholes.
p340
aa(lp341
VBut the real test is going to be Asia.
p342
aVCan connectivity overcome the patterns of rivalry
p343
aVamong the great powers of the Far East?
p344
aVAfter all, this is where World War III is supposed to break out.
p345
aVSince the end of the Cold War, a quarter century ago,
p346
aVat least six major wars have been predicted for this region.
p347
aVBut none have broken out.
p348
aa(lp349
VTake China and Taiwan.
p350
aVIn the 1990s, this was everyone's leading World War III scenario.
p351
aVBut since that time,
p352
aVthe trade and investment volumes across the straits have become so intense
p353
aVthat last November,
p354
aVleaders from both sides held a historic summit
p355
aVto discuss eventual peaceful reunification.
p356
aVAnd even the election of a nationalist party in Taiwan
p357
aVthat's pro-independence earlier this year
p358
aVdoes not undermine this fundamental dynamic.
p359
aa(lp360
VChina and Japan have an even longer history of rivalry
p361
aVand have been deploying their air forces and navies
p362
aVto show their strength in island disputes.
p363
aVBut in recent years,
p364
aVJapan has been making its largest foreign investments in China.
p365
aVJapanese cars are selling in record numbers there.
p366
aVAnd guess where the largest number of foreigners
p367
aVresiding in Japan today comes from?
p368
aVYou guessed it: China.
p369
aa(lp370
VChina and India have fought a major war
p371
aVand have three outstanding border disputes,
p372
aVbut today India is the second largest shareholder
p373
aVin the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
p374
aVThey're building a trade corridor stretching from Northeast India
p375
aVthrough Myanmar and Bangladesh to Southern China.
p376
aVTheir trade volume has grown from 20 billion dollars a decade ago
p377
aVto 80 billion dollars today.
p378
aa(lp379
VNuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought three wars
p380
aVand continue to dispute Kashmir,
p381
aVbut they're also negotiating a most-favored-nation trade agreement
p382
aVand want to complete a pipeline
p383
aVstretching from Iran through Pakistan to India.
p384
aa(lp385
VAnd let's talk about Iran.
p386
aVWasn't it just two years ago that war with Iran seemed inevitable?
p387
aVThen why is every single major power rushing to do business there today?
p388
aa(lp389
VLadies and gentlemen,
p390
aVI cannot guarantee that World War III will not break out.
p391
aVBut we can definitely see why it hasn't happened yet.
p392
aVEven though Asia is home to the world's fastest growing militaries,
p393
aVthese same countries are also investing billions of dollars
p394
aVin each other's infrastructure and supply chains.
p395
aVThey are more interested in each other's functional geography
p396
aVthan in their political geography.
p397
aVAnd that is why their leaders think twice, step back from the brink,
p398
aVand decide to focus on economic ties over territorial tensions.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo often it seems like the world is falling apart,
p401
aVbut building more connectivity
p402
aVis how we put Humpty Dumpty back together again,
p403
aVmuch better than before.
p404
aVAnd by wrapping the world
p405
aVin such seamless physical and digital connectivity,
p406
aVwe evolve towards a world
p407
aVin which people can rise above their geographic constraints.
p408
aVWe are the cells and vessels
p409
aVpulsing through these global connectivity networks.
p410
aa(lp411
VEveryday, hundreds of millions of people go online
p412
aVand work with people they've never met.
p413
aVMore than one billion people cross borders every year,
p414
aVand that's expected to rise to three billion in the coming decade.
p415
aa(lp416
VWe don't just build connectivity,
p417
aVwe embody it.
p418
aVWe are the global network civilization,
p419
aVand this is our map.
p420
aVA map of the world in which geography is no longer destiny.
p421
aVInstead, the future has a new and more hopeful motto:
p422
aVconnectivity is destiny.
p423
aa(lp424
VThank you.

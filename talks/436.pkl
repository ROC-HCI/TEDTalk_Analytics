VI had requested slides,
p5
aVkind of adamantly,
p6
aVup till the \u2014 pretty much, last few days,
p7
aVbut was denied access to a slide projector.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVI actually find them a lot more emotional \u2014
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aV\u2014 and personal,
p12
aVand the neat thing about a slide projector
p13
aVis you can actually focus the work,
p14
aVunlike PowerPoint and some other programs.
p15
aVNow, I agree that
p16
aVyou have to \u2014 yeah, there are certain concessions
p17
aVand, you know, if you use a slide projector,
p18
aVyou're not able to have the bad type
p19
aVswing in from the back or the side, or up or down,
p20
aVbut maybe that's an O.K. trade-off,
p21
aVto trade that off for a focus.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVIt's a thought. Just a thought.
p24
aVAnd there's something nice about slides getting stuck.
p25
aVAnd the thing you really hope for
p26
aVis occasionally they burn up,
p27
aVwhich we won't see tonight. So.
p28
aa(lp29
VWith that, let's get the first slide up here.
p30
aVThis, as many of you have probably guessed,
p31
aVis a
p32
aVrecently emptied beer can in Portugal.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVThis \u2014 I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time,
p35
aVand I thought \u2014
p36
aVyou know, fly all night, I looked up,
p37
aVand I thought, wow, how clean.
p38
aVYou come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.
p39
aVI mean, how nice is that?
p40
aVEverything's gotten simpler in design,
p41
aVand here's this mega airport,
p42
aVand God, I just \u2014 I took a picture.
p43
aVI thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.
p44
aVTill a couple months later,
p45
aVI went back to the same airport \u2014
p46
aVsame plane, I think \u2014 and looked up,
p47
aVand it said C.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVIt was only then that I realized
p50
aVit was simply a gate that I was coming into.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VI'm a big believer in the emotion of design,
p54
aVand the message that's sent
p55
aVbefore somebody begins to read,
p56
aVbefore they get the rest of the information;
p57
aVwhat is the emotional response they get to the product,
p58
aVto the story, to the painting \u2014 whatever it is.
p59
aVThat area of design interests me the most,
p60
aVand I think this for me is a real clear,
p61
aVvery simplified version
p62
aVof what I'm talking about.
p63
aVThese are a couple of garage doors painted identical,
p64
aVsituated next to each other.
p65
aVSo, here's the first door. You know, you get the message.
p66
aVYou know, it's pretty clear.
p67
aVTake a look at the second door and see
p68
aVif there's any different message.
p69
aVO.K., which one would you park in front of?
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVSame color, same message, same words.
p72
aVThe only thing that's different
p73
aVis the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece \u2014
p74
aVand, again,
p75
aVwhich is the psycho-killer here?
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVYet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.
p78
aVI would probably park in front of the other one.
p79
aa(lp80
VI'm sure a lot of you are aware
p81
aVthat graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last
p82
aVfive years or so.
p83
aVIt's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of
p84
aVcome back the other way again and get a little more expressive.
p85
aVBut I was in Milan and saw this street sign,
p86
aVand was very happy to
p87
aVsee that apparently this idea of minimalism
p88
aVhas even been translated by the graffiti artist.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVAnd this graffiti artist has come along,
p91
aVmade this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVHe didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VThis is for a book by "Metropolis."
p97
aVI took some photos, and this is
p98
aVa billboard in Florida,
p99
aVand either they hadn't paid their rent,
p100
aVor they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign,
p101
aVand the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down,
p102
aVso they just teared out sections of it.
p103
aVAnd I would argue that it's possibly more effective
p104
aVthan the original billboard in terms of getting your attention,
p105
aVgetting you to look over that way.
p106
aVAnd hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things \u2014 Stuckey's.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis is from my second book.
p109
aVThe first book is called, "The End of Print,"
p110
aVand it was done along with a film,
p111
aVworking with William Burroughs.
p112
aVAnd "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVWhen I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it,
p115
aVhe said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.
p116
aVAnd I said, well, that's fine;
p117
aVI just would love to have your input on this film and this book,
p118
aVand he finally agreed to it.
p119
aVAnd at the end of the film, he says in this great voice
p120
aVthat I can't mimic but I'll kind of try, but not really, he says,
p121
aV"I remember attending an exhibition called,
p122
aV'Photography: The End of Painting.'"
p123
aVAnd then he says, "And, of course, it wasn't at all."
p124
aVSo, apparently when photography was perfected,
p125
aVthere were people going around saying,
p126
aVthat's it: you've just ruined painting.
p127
aVPeople are just going to take pictures now.
p128
aVAnd of course, that wasn't the case.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, this is from "2nd Sight,"
p131
aVa book I did on intuition.
p132
aVI think it's not the only ingredient in design,
p133
aVbut possibly the most important.
p134
aVIt's something everybody has.
p135
aVIt's not a matter of teaching it;
p136
aVin fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition
p137
aVas an ingredient of your working process
p138
aVbecause they can't quantify it:
p139
aVit's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design,
p140
aVbut we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card
p141
aVor a newsletter.
p142
aVSo it tends to get discounted.
p143
aVThis is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says,
p144
aV"The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.
p145
aVThere comes a leap in consciousness \u2014
p146
aVcall it intuition or what you will \u2014
p147
aVand the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why."
p148
aVSo, it's kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?
p149
aVAnd the more you try to think about it,
p150
aVthe further the answer gets from you,
p151
aVand the minute you stop thinking about it,
p152
aVyour intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.
p153
aa(lp154
VI like this for a couple of reasons.
p155
aVIf you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this.
p156
aVI think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.
p157
aV"Don't mistake legibility for communication."
p158
aVJust because something's legible doesn't means it communicates.
p159
aVMore importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.
p160
aVSo, what is the message sent before
p161
aVsomebody actually gets into the material?
p162
aVAnd I think that's sometimes an overlooked area.
p163
aa(lp164
VThis is working with Marshall McLuhan.
p165
aVI stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric,
p166
aVand we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall
p167
aVthat are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times,
p168
aVpredicting so much of what has happened
p169
aVin the advertising, television, media world.
p170
aVAnd so this book is called "Probes." It's another word for quotes.
p171
aVAnd it's \u2014 a lot of them are never \u2014 have never been published before,
p172
aVand basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.
p173
aVSo, this was the contents page originally.
p174
aVWhen I got done it was 540 pages,
p175
aVand then the publisher, Gingko Press,
p176
aVended up cutting it down considerably:
p177
aVit's just under 400 pages now.
p178
aVBut I decided I liked this contents page \u2014
p179
aVI liked the way it looks \u2014 so I kept it.
p180
aV(Laughter)
p181
aVIt now has no relevance to the book whatsoever,
p182
aVbut it's a nice spread, I think, in there.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VSo, a couple spreads from the book:
p186
aVhere McLuhan says,
p187
aV"The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature."
p188
aV"The invention of printing did away with anonymity,
p189
aVfostering ideas of literary fame
p190
aVand the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property,"
p191
aVwhich had never been done before printing.
p192
aV"When new technologies impose themselves
p193
aVon societies long habituated to older technologies,
p194
aVanxieties of all kinds result."
p195
aV"While people are engaged in creating a totally different world,
p196
aVthey always form vivid images of the preceding world."
p197
aVI hate this stuff. It's hard to read.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aV(Applause)
p200
aV"People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe,
p201
aVand no possible occupation except information gathering."
p202
aVThat was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.
p205
aVAnd I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden,
p206
aVand it was done right after 9/11.
p207
aVAnd I had recently discovered a bomb shelter
p208
aVin the backyard of a house I had bought in LA
p209
aVthat the real estate person hadn't pointed out.
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVThere was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.
p212
aVAnd I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by,
p213
aVand he goes, "It's something to do with the sewage system."
p214
aVI was, O.K.; that's fine.
p215
aVI finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing,
p216
aVand two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.
p217
aVAnd also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal,
p218
aVand it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.
p219
aVAnd I thought, you know, what were they thinking?
p220
aVYou'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.
p221
aVBut anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD,
p222
aVand I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape,
p223
aVand it's ready. I think I'm ready. So.
p224
aa(lp225
VThis is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver,
p226
aVwhere we were taking what was a six-shot sequence
p227
aVand trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.
p228
aVSo, this is a six-shot sequence.
p229
aVI've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.
p230
aVAnd then the tiny line of copy says,
p231
aVIf you want to see this entire sequence \u2014
p232
aVhow this whole ride was \u2014 go to the website.
p233
aVAnd my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site
p234
aVto get this entire picture.
p235
aVGot no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVI don't have the site. It's just the piece itself.
p238
aa(lp239
VThis is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment \u2014
p240
aVasked me to do these posters.
p241
aVThey were wild-posted around New York City.
p242
aVYou can't really \u2014 well, you can't see it at all \u2014
p243
aVbut the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.
p244
aVIt says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But \u2014
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aV(Applause)
p247
aV\u2014 but I did.
p248
aVThese were literally wild-posted all over New York one night,
p249
aVand there were definitely some heads turning,
p250
aVyou know, people smoking and, "Huh!"
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVAnd it was purposely done to look fairly serious.
p253
aVIt wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something;
p254
aVit looked like they might be real. Anyway.
p255
aa(lp256
VPoster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida.
p257
aa(lp258
VThis amazes me. This is a product I just found out.
p259
aVI was in the Caribbean at Christmas,
p260
aVand I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell \u2014
p261
aVnot that they will sell \u2014
p262
aVthat there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.
p263
aVThis was either an old product with new packaging,
p264
aVor a brand-new package, and I just thought,
p265
aVYikes! How's that still happening?
p266
aa(lp267
VI do a lot of workshops all over the world, really,
p268
aVand this particular assignment was
p269
aVto come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.
p270
aV(Laughter)
p271
aVI felt this was one of the more successful solutions.
p272
aVThe students actually cut them up
p273
aVand put them up around bars and restaurants that night,
p274
aVand I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ...
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VI did some work for Microsoft a few years back.
p278
aVIt was a worldwide branding campaign.
p279
aVAnd it was interesting to me \u2014
p280
aVmy background is in sociology; I had no design training,
p281
aVand sometimes people say, well, that explains it \u2014
p282
aVbut it was a very interesting experiment
p283
aVbecause there's no product that I had to sell;
p284
aVit was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.
p285
aVThey thought some people didn't like them.
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVI found out that's very true,
p288
aVworking on this campaign worldwide.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd our goal was to try to humanize them a bit,
p291
aVand what I did was add type and people to the ad,
p292
aVwhich the previous campaign had not had,
p293
aVand nobody remembered them, and nobody referenced them.
p294
aVAnd we were trying to say that,
p295
aVhey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK;
p296
aVsome of them actually have friends and family,
p297
aVand they're not all awful people.
p298
aVAnd the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday."
p299
aVSo, we tried to take this \u2014
p300
aVwhat was perceived as a negative:
p301
aVtheir over-competitiveness, their,
p302
aVyou know, long working hours \u2014
p303
aVand turn it into a positive and not run from it.
p304
aVYou know: Thank God it's Monday \u2014
p305
aVI get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls,
p306
aVand hear everybody else's conversations f
p307
aVor 10 hours and then go home.
p308
aa(lp309
VBut anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with,
p310
aVbecause they were all elaborately art-directed,
p311
aVand this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer.
p312
aVIt says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.
p313
aVAnd this is how the ad ran around the world.
p314
aVIn Germany, they made one small change without checking with me \u2014
p315
aVnor did they have to, because it was done through agencies \u2014
p316
aVbut see if you can tell the difference.
p317
aVThis is how the ad ran throughout the world;
p318
aVGermany made one slight change in the ad.
p319
aV(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VNow, there's kind of two issues here.
p322
aVIf you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive.
p323
aV(Laughter)
p324
aVI just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.
p325
aVHe's just really hoping that boots up and, you know ...
p326
aV(Laughter)
p327
aVAnd then as the agency explained to me, they said,
p328
aV"Look, we don't have little green people in our country;
p329
aVwhy would we put little green people in our ads, for instance?"
p330
aVSo, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it;
p331
aVI think it's a very small-minded approach,
p332
aVthe world is certainly much more global,
p333
aVand I certainly think the people of Germany
p334
aVcould have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer,
p335
aVthough we'll never know.
p336
aa(lp337
VThis is some work from Ray Gun.
p338
aVAnd the point of this magazine was to read the articles,
p339
aVlisten to the music, and try to interpret it.
p340
aVThere's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.
p341
aVThis is an opener for Brian Eno,
p342
aVand it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.
p343
aVThis is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.
p344
aVThere's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."
p345
aVAnd I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.
p346
aV(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VArticle on Bryan Ferry \u2014 just really boring article \u2014
p349
aVso I set the whole article in Dingbat.
p350
aV(Laughter)
p351
aVYou could \u2014 you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something:
p352
aVit is the actual article.
p353
aVI suppose you could eventually decode it,
p354
aVbut it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VHaving done a lot of magazines,
p358
aVI'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories,
p359
aVand I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.
p360
aVAnd I was basically pretty disappointed
p361
aVto see that they had
p362
aVchosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times,
p363
aVwhich was basically the moment of impact.
p364
aVAnd People magazine, I thought,
p365
aVgot probably the best shot.
p366
aVIt's kind of horsey type, but the texture \u2014
p367
aVthe second plane not quite hitting:
p368
aVthere was something more enticing,
p369
aVif that's the right \u2014 it's not the right word \u2014
p370
aVbut in this cover than Time or Newsweek.
p371
aa(lp372
VBut when I got into this magazine,
p373
aVthere's something kind of disturbing, and this continued.
p374
aVOn the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives.
p375
aVAnd on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.
p376
aVThe coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.
p377
aVLook at the image of this lady \u2014
p378
aVwho knows what she's going through? \u2014
p379
aVand the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps."
p380
aVYeah, he jumps out of buildings. It's \u2014
p381
aVunfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread.
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd this continued through the entire magazine.
p384
aVIt did not let up.
p385
aVThis says: "One clean fits all." .
p386
aVThere were a lot of orphans made this day,
p387
aVand here's a dead body being brought out.
p388
aVIt just seems to me possibly even a blank page
p389
aVwould have been more appropriate.
p390
aVAnd this one I think is possibly the worst:
p391
aVtwo ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.
p392
aVOne \u2014 who knows what she's going through;
p393
aVthe other one is worried about model behavior and milk.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd \u2014
p396
aVI gave a talk in New York a couple months after this,
p397
aVand afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that \u2014
p398
aVthey actually emailed me \u2014 and they said that they appreciated the talk,
p399
aVand when they got back to their car,
p400
aVthey found a note on their car that made them think
p401
aVmaybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event \u2014
p402
aVit had been a few months.
p403
aVThis was what they found on their car.
p404
aV(Laughter)
p405
aVThere's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car,
p406
aVbut it did seem to indicate that we were coming back.
p407
aa(lp408
VThis is my desktop.
p409
aVSomebody told me today there was this thing called folders,
p410
aVbut I don't know what they are.
p411
aVThese are my notes for the talk \u2014 there might be a correlation here.
p412
aVWe are wrapping up.
p413
aa(lp414
VThis I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.
p415
aVI'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea,
p416
aVbecause, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer,
p417
aVyou can now get a plate in the keyboard,
p418
aVso there's no more faking it \u2014
p419
aVthat you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.
p420
aVNow there's a plate, and it would be really, really convenient
p421
aVto get a piece of pizza, then type a little bit, then ...
p422
aVI'm just not sure this is improvement.
p423
aa(lp424
VIf you ever doubt the power of graphic design,
p425
aVthis is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler." It says nothing else.
p426
aVAnd this to me is an extreme case
p427
aVof the power of emotion, of graphic design,
p428
aVeven though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.
p429
aa(lp430
VWhat's next? What's next is going to be people.
p431
aVAs we get more technically driven,
p432
aVthe importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.
p433
aVYou have to utilize who you are in your work.
p434
aVNobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background,
p435
aVfrom your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.
p436
aVIf you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work,
p437
aVand you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.
p438
aa(lp439
VThis is \u2014 I like found art; hand lettering's coming back in a big way,
p440
aVand I thought this was a great example of both.
p441
aVThis lady's advertising for her lost pit bull.
p442
aVIt's friendly \u2014 she's underlined friendly \u2014
p443
aVthat's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell.
p444
aV(Laughter)
p445
aVBut more importantly,
p446
aVshe's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.
p447
aVAnd I'm thinking, yeah, right,
p448
aVI'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.
p449
aVI have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles,
p450
aVand you get charged by this thing and you go,
p451
aVoh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.
p452
aV(Laughter)
p453
aVI'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.
p454
aV(Laughter)
p455
aa(lp456
VBut I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.
p457
aVAnd the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk
p458
aVabout how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.
p459
aVAnd I remembered seeing this photograph of my father,
p460
aVwho was a test pilot, and he told me that
p461
aVwhen you signed up to become a test pilot,
p462
aVthey told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance
p463
aVof death on the job.
p464
aVThat's pretty high for most occupations.
p465
aV(Laughter)
p466
aVBut, you know, the government would make a plane;
p467
aVthey'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?
p468
aVSome of them did; some of them didn't.
p469
aa(lp470
VAnd I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make
p471
aVbetween, like, serif versus san-serif.
p472
aV(Laughter)
p473
aVAnd for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.
p474
aVWhy not experiment? Why not have some fun?
p475
aVWhy not put some of yourself into the work?
p476
aVAnd when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students,
p477
aVWhat's the definition of a good job?
p478
aVAnd as teachers, after you get all the answers,
p479
aVyou like to give them the correct answer.
p480
aVAnd the best one I've heard \u2014 I'm sure some of you have heard this \u2014
p481
aVthe definition of a good job is:
p482
aVIf you could afford to \u2014 if money wasn't an issue \u2014
p483
aVwould you be doing that same work?
p484
aVAnd if you would, you've got a great job.
p485
aVAnd if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?
p486
aVYou're going to be dead a really long time.
p487
aVThank you very much.

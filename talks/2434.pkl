VAs a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.
p5
aVIt was this wild place full of color and life,
p6
aVhome to these alien-looking, fantastical creatures.
p7
aVI pictured big sharks ruling the food chain
p8
aVand saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.
p9
aa(lp10
VAs a marine biologist turned photographer,
p11
aVI've spent most of my career looking for places
p12
aVas magical as those I used to dream about when I was little.
p13
aVAs you can see,
p14
aVI began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age.
p15
aVBut the first time I truly went underwater,
p16
aVI was about 10 years old.
p17
aVAnd I can still vividly remember furiously finning
p18
aVto reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef.
p19
aVAnd when I finally managed to grab hold of it,
p20
aVI looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish
p21
aVin all colors of the rainbow.
p22
aVThat was the day I fell in love with the ocean.

aa(lp28
VIn my 40 years on this planet,
p29
aVI've had the great privilege to explore
p30
aVsome of its most incredible seascapes
p31
aVfor National Geographic Magazine
p32
aVand the Save Our Seas Foundation.
p33
aVI've photographed everything from really, really big sharks
p34
aVto dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
p35
aVI've smelled the fishy, fishy breath of humpback whales
p36
aVfeeding just feet away from me
p37
aVin the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest.
p38
aVAnd I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles
p39
aVin the Mozambique Channel.
p40
aa(lp41
VEveryone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean.
p42
aVAnd the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child
p43
aVare becoming harder and harder to find.
p44
aVThey are becoming more compressed
p45
aVand more threatened.
p46
aVAs we humans continue to maintain our role
p47
aVas the leading predator on earth,
p48
aVI've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand.
p49
aVFor a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience
p50
aVout of their indifference with disturbing images.
p51
aVAnd while this approach has merits,
p52
aVI have come full circle.
p53
aVI believe that the best way for me to effect change
p54
aVis to sell love.
p55
aVI guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts
p56
aVand as a photographer,
p57
aVI have the rare opportunity
p58
aVto reveal animals and entire ecosystems
p59
aVthat lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface.
p60
aVYou can't love something and become a champion for it
p61
aVif you don't know it exists.
p62
aVUncovering this \u2014 that is the power of conservation photography.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Music)
p65
aa(lp66
VI've visited hundreds of marine locations,
p67
aVbut there are a handful of seascapes
p68
aVthat have touched me incredibly deeply.
p69
aVThe first time I experienced that kind of high
p70
aVwas about 10 years ago,
p71
aVoff South Africa's rugged, wild coast.
p72
aVAnd every June and July,
p73
aVenormous shoals of sardines travel northwards
p74
aVin a mass migration we call the Sardine Run.
p75
aVAnd boy, do those fish have good reason to run.
p76
aVIn hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators.
p77
aVCommon dolphins hunt together
p78
aVand they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal
p79
aVand they create bait balls.
p80
aVThey drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface
p81
aVand then they rush in to dine
p82
aVon this pulsating and movable feast.
p83
aVClose behind are sharks.
p84
aVNow, most people believe
p85
aVthat sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies,
p86
aVbut during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.
p87
aVIn fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively.
p88
aVWithout dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed
p89
aVand sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut,
p90
aVor a mouth full of water.
p91
aVNow, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run,
p92
aVI know they don't see me as prey.
p93
aVHowever, I get bumped and tail-slapped just like any other guest
p94
aVat this rowdy, rowdy banquet.
p95
aa(lp96
VFrom the shores of Africa we travel east,
p97
aVacross the vastness that is the Indian Ocean
p98
aVto the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
p99
aVAnd during the stormy southwest monsoon,
p100
aVmanta rays from all across the archipelago
p101
aVtravel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
p102
aVArmies of crustaceans,
p103
aVmost no bigger than the size of your pupils,
p104
aVare the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.
p105
aVWhen plankton concentrations become patchy,
p106
aVmanta rays feed alone
p107
aVand they somersault themselves backwards again and again,
p108
aVvery much like a puppy chasing its own tail.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Music)
p111
aa(lp112
VHowever, when plankton densities increase,
p113
aVthe mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains,
p114
aVand any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line
p115
aVis surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after.
p116
aVAs plankton levels peak in the bay,
p117
aVthe mantas swim closer and closer together
p118
aVin a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding.
p119
aVAnd as they swirl in tight formation,
p120
aVthis multi-step column of mantas
p121
aVcreates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton
p122
aVright into the mantas' cavernous mouths.
p123
aVThe experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays
p124
aVis truly unforgettable.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Music)
p127
aa(lp128
VWhen I first photographed Hanifaru,
p129
aVthe site enjoyed no protection
p130
aVand was threatened by development.
p131
aVAnd working with NGOs like the Manta Trust,
p132
aVmy images eventually helped Hanifaru
p133
aVbecome a marine-protected area.
p134
aVNow, fisherman from neighboring islands,
p135
aVthey once hunted these manta rays
p136
aVto make traditional drums from their skins.
p137
aVToday, they are the most ardent conservation champions
p138
aVand manta rays earn the Maldivian economy
p139
aVin excess of 8 million dollars every single year.
p140
aa(lp141
VI have always wanted to travel back in time
p142
aVto an era where maps were mostly blank
p143
aVor they read, "There be dragons."
p144
aVAnd today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls
p145
aVin the western Indian Ocean.
p146
aVFar, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets,
p147
aVdiving into these waters is a poignant reminder
p148
aVof what our oceans once looked like.
p149
aa(lp150
VVery few people have heard of Bassas da India,
p151
aVa tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
p152
aVIts reef forms a protective outer barrier
p153
aVand the inner lagoon is a nursery ground
p154
aVfor Galapagos sharks.
p155
aVThese sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
p156
aVI had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder
p157
aVand more abundant at night.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Music)
p160
aa(lp161
VNever before have I encountered
p162
aVso many sharks on a single coral outcrop.
p163
aVCapturing and sharing moments like this \u2014
p164
aVthat reminds me why I chose my path.
p165
aa(lp166
VEarlier this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine
p167
aVin Baja California.
p168
aVAnd about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side
p169
aVlies San Ignacio Lagoon,
p170
aVa critical calving ground for gray whales.
p171
aVFor 100 years, this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter,
p172
aVwhere more than 20,000 gray whales were killed,
p173
aVleaving only a few hundred survivors.
p174
aVToday the descendents of these same whales
p175
aVnudge their youngsters to the surface
p176
aVto play and even interact with us.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Music)
p179
aa(lp180
VThis species truly has made a remarkable comeback.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo,
p183
aVa sleepy fishing village.
p184
aVDecades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse.
p185
aVIn 1995, local fisherman convinced the authorities
p186
aVto proclaim their waters a marine reserve.
p187
aVBut what happened next was nothing short of miraculous.
p188
aVIn 2005, after only a single decade of protection,
p189
aVscientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded.
p190
aa(lp191
VBut don't take my word for it \u2014 come with me.
p192
aVOn a single breath, swim with me in deep,
p193
aVinto one of the largest and densest schools of fish
p194
aVI have ever encountered.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Music)
p197
aa(lp198
VWe all have the ability to be creators of hope.
p199
aVAnd through my photography,
p200
aVI want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
p201
aVAnd particularly, I want to focus on nature's resilience
p202
aVin the face of 7.3 billion people.
p203
aa(lp204
VMy hope is that in the future,
p205
aVI will have to search much, much harder
p206
aVto make photographs like this,
p207
aVwhile creating images that showcase
p208
aVour respectful coexistence with the ocean.
p209
aVThose will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me.
p210
aa(lp211
VTo thrive and survive in my profession,
p212
aVyou really have to be a hopeless optimist.
p213
aVAnd I always operate on the assumption
p214
aVthat the next great picture that will effect change
p215
aVis right around the corner,
p216
aVbehind the next coral head,
p217
aVinside the next lagoon
p218
aVor possibly, in the one after it.

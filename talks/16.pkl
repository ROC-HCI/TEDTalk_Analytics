VI'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends
p5
aVin the coming century,
p6
aVand perhaps in the next 10,000 years.
p7
aVBut I want to start with my work on romantic love,
p8
aVbecause that's my most recent work.
p9
aVWhat I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love,
p10
aVinto a functional MRI brain scanner.
p11
aV17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted;
p12
aVand 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped.
p13
aVAnd so I want to tell you about that first,
p14
aVand then go on into where I think love is going.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
V"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.
p19
aVI think our ancestors \u2014
p20
aVI think human beings have been wondering about this question
p21
aVsince they sat around their campfires
p22
aVor lay and watched the stars a million years ago.
p23
aVI started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was
p24
aVby looking at the last 45 years of the psychological research
p25
aVand as it turns out,
p26
aVthere's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love.
p27
aVThe first thing that happens is,
p28
aVa person begins to take on what I call, "special meaning."
p29
aVAs a truck driver once said to me,
p30
aV"The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."
p31
aa(lp32
VGeorge Bernard Shaw said it differently.
p33
aV"Love consists of overestimating the differences
p34
aVbetween one woman and another."
p35
aVAnd indeed, that's what we do.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd then you just focus on this person.
p40
aVYou can list what you don't like about them,
p41
aVbut then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.
p42
aVAs Chaucer said, "Love is blind."
p43
aa(lp44
VIn trying to understand romantic love,
p45
aVI decided I would read poetry from all over the world,
p46
aVand I just want to give you one very short poem
p47
aVfrom eighth-century China,
p48
aVbecause it's an almost perfect example
p49
aVof a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.
p50
aVIt's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody
p51
aVand you walk into a parking lot \u2014
p52
aVtheir car is different from every other car in the parking lot.
p53
aVTheir wine glass at dinner
p54
aVis different from every other wine glass at the dinner party.
p55
aVAnd in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd it goes like this.
p58
aVIt's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.
p59
aV"I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.
p60
aVThe night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."
p61
aVHe became hooked on a sleeping mat,
p62
aVprobably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain,
p63
aVjust like with you and me.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut anyway, not only does this person take on special meaning,
p66
aVyou focus your attention on them.
p67
aVYou aggrandize them.
p68
aVBut you have intense energy.
p69
aVAs one Polynesian said, "I felt like jumping in the sky."
p70
aVYou're up all night. You're walking till dawn.
p71
aVYou feel intense elation when things are going well;
p72
aVmood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly.
p73
aVReal dependence on this person.
p74
aVAs one businessman in New York said to me,
p75
aV"Anything she liked, I liked."
p76
aVSimple. Romantic love is very simple.
p77
aa(lp78
VYou become extremely sexually possessive.
p79
aVYou know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually,
p80
aVyou don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else.
p81
aVBut the moment you fall in love,
p82
aVyou become extremely sexually possessive of them.
p83
aVI think there's a Darwinian purpose to this.
p84
aVThe whole point of this is to pull two people together
p85
aVstrongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut the main characteristics of romantic love are craving:
p88
aVan intense craving to be with a particular person,
p89
aVnot just sexually, but emotionally.
p90
aVIt would be nice to go to bed with them,
p91
aVbut you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,
p92
aVto tell you that they love you.
p93
aVThe other main characteristic is motivation.
p94
aVThe motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd last but not least, it is an obsession.
p97
aVBefore I put these people in the MRI machine,
p98
aVI would ask them all kinds of questions.
p99
aVBut my most important question was always the same.
p100
aVIt was: "What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person?"
p101
aVAnd indeed, they would say,
p102
aV"All day. All night.
p103
aVI can never stop thinking about him or her."
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd then, the very last question \u2014
p106
aVI would always have to work myself up to this question,
p107
aVbecause I'm not a psychologist.
p108
aVI don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.
p109
aVMy final question was always the same.
p110
aVI would say, "Would you die for him or her?"
p111
aVAnd, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"
p112
aVas if I had asked them to pass the salt.
p113
aVI was just staggered by it.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo we scanned their brains,
p116
aVlooking at a photograph of their sweetheart
p117
aVand looking at a neutral photograph,
p118
aVwith a distraction task in between.
p119
aVSo we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state
p120
aVand when it was in a resting state.
p121
aVAnd we found activity in a lot of brain regions.
p122
aVIn fact, one of the most important was a brain region
p123
aVthat becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine.
p124
aVAnd indeed, that's exactly what happens.
p125
aa(lp126
VI began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion.
p127
aVIn fact, I had always thought it was a series of emotions,
p128
aVfrom very high to very low.
p129
aVBut actually, it's a drive.
p130
aVIt comes from the motor of the mind,
p131
aVthe wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.
p132
aVThe kind of part of the mind
p133
aVwhen you're reaching for that piece of chocolate,
p134
aVwhen you want to win that promotion at work.
p135
aVThe motor of the brain.
p136
aVIt's a drive.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.
p139
aVYou know, if you ask somebody to go to bed with you,
p140
aVand they say, "No, thank you,"
p141
aVyou certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression.
p142
aVBut certainly, around the world,
p143
aVpeople who are rejected in love will kill for it.
p144
aVPeople live for love.
p145
aVThey kill for love.
p146
aVThey die for love.
p147
aVThey have songs, poems, novels,
p148
aVsculptures, paintings, myths, legends.
p149
aVIn over 175 societies,
p150
aVpeople have left their evidence of this powerful brain system.
p151
aVI have come to think
p152
aVit's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth
p153
aVfor both great joy and great sorrow.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd I've also come to think
p156
aVthat it's one of three basically different brain systems
p157
aVthat evolved from mating and reproduction.
p158
aVOne is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification.
p159
aVW.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch,"
p160
aVand indeed, that's what it is.
p161
aVIt keeps bothering you a little bit, like being hungry.
p162
aVThe second of these three brain systems is romantic love:
p163
aVthat elation, obsession of early love.
p164
aVAnd the third brain system is attachment:
p165
aVthat sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there,
p168
aVlooking for a whole range of partners.
p169
aVYou can feel it when you're just driving along in your car.
p170
aVIt can be focused on nobody.
p171
aVI think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy
p172
aVon just one individual at a time,
p173
aVthereby conserving mating time and energy.
p174
aVAnd I think that attachment, the third brain system,
p175
aVevolved to enable you to tolerate this human being
p176
aVat least long enough to raise a child together as a team.
p177
aVSo with that preamble,
p178
aVI want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends.
p179
aVOne of the last 10,000 years
p180
aVand the other, certainly of the last 25 years,
p181
aVthat are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems:
p182
aVlust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.
p183
aa(lp184
VThe first is women working, moving into the workforce.
p185
aVI've looked at 130 societies
p186
aVthrough the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations.
p187
aVEverywhere in the world, 129 out of 130 of them,
p188
aVwomen are not only moving into the job market \u2014
p189
aVsometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market \u2014
p190
aVand they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women
p191
aVin terms of economic power, health and education.
p192
aVIt's very slow.
p193
aa(lp194
VFor every trend on this planet, there's a counter-trend.
p195
aVWe all know of them, but nevertheless \u2014
p196
aVthe Arabs say, "The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on."
p197
aVAnd, indeed, that caravan is moving on.
p198
aVWomen are moving back into the job market.
p199
aVAnd I say back into the job market, because this is not new.
p200
aVFor millions of years, on the grasslands of Africa,
p201
aVwomen commuted to work to gather their vegetables.
p202
aVThey came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
p203
aVThe double income family was the standard.
p204
aVAnd women were regarded as just as economically,
p205
aVsocially and sexually powerful as men.
p206
aVIn short, we're really moving forward to the past.
p207
aa(lp208
VThen, women's worst invention was the plow.
p209
aVWith the beginning of plow agriculture, men's roles became extremely powerful.
p210
aVWomen lost their ancient jobs as collectors,
p211
aVbut then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution
p212
aVthey're moving back into the job market.
p213
aVIn short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago,
p214
aV10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.
p215
aVWe are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions
p216
aVin the history of the human animal.
p217
aVAnd it's going to have an impact.
p218
aa(lp219
VI generally give a whole lecture
p220
aVon the impact of women on the business community.
p221
aVI'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.
p222
aVThere's a lot of gender differences;
p223
aVanybody who thinks men and women are alike
p224
aVsimply never had a boy and a girl child.
p225
aVI don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike.
p226
aVThere's much we have in common,
p227
aVbut there's a whole lot that we do not have in common.
p228
aa(lp229
VWe are \u2014 in the words of Ted Hughes,
p230
aV"I think that we are like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."
p231
aVBut we did not evolve to have the same brain.
p232
aVAnd we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain.
p233
aVI'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.
p234
aVOne of them is women's verbal ability.
p235
aVWomen can talk.
p236
aa(lp237
VWomen's ability to find the right word rapidly, basic articulation
p238
aVgoes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle,
p239
aVwhen estrogen levels peak.
p240
aVBut even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.
p241
aVWomen can talk.
p242
aVThey've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.
p243
aVThey held that baby in front of their face,
p244
aVcajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.
p245
aVAnd, indeed, they're becoming a very powerful force.
p246
aa(lp247
VEven in places like India and Japan,
p248
aVwhere women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market,
p249
aVthey're moving into journalism.
p250
aVAnd I think that the television is like the global campfire.
p251
aVWe sit around it and it shapes our minds.
p252
aVAlmost always, when I'm on TV, the producer who calls me,
p253
aVwho negotiates what we're going to say,
p254
aVis a woman.
p255
aVIn fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,
p256
aV"To have a great writer is to have another government."
p257
aa(lp258
VToday 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women.
p259
aVIt's one of many, many characteristics that women have
p260
aVthat they will bring into the job market.
p261
aVThey've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills.
p262
aVThey're highly imaginative.
p263
aVWe now know the brain circuitry of imagination, of long-term planning.
p264
aVThey tend to be web thinkers.
p265
aVBecause the female parts of the brain are better connected,
p266
aVthey tend to collect more pieces of data when they think,
p267
aVput them into more complex patterns, see more options and outcomes.
p268
aVThey tend to be contextual, holistic thinkers,
p269
aVwhat I call web thinkers.
p270
aa(lp271
VMen tend to \u2014 and these are averages \u2014
p272
aVtend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous,
p273
aVfocus on what they do,
p274
aVand move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern.
p275
aVThey're both perfectly good ways of thinking.
p276
aVWe need both of them to get ahead.
p277
aVIn fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.
p278
aVAnd there's also many more male idiots in the world.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VWhen the male brain works well, it works extremely well.
p283
aVAnd what I really think that we're doing is,
p284
aVwe're moving towards a collaborative society,
p285
aVa society in which the talents of both men and women
p286
aVare becoming understood and valued and employed.
p287
aa(lp288
VBut in fact, women moving into the job market
p289
aVis having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life.
p290
aVForemost, women are starting to express their sexuality.
p291
aVI'm always astonished when people come to me and say,
p292
aV"Why is it that men are so adulterous?"
p293
aV"Why do you think more men are adulterous than women?"
p294
aV"Well, men are more adulterous!"
p295
aVAnd I say, "Who do you think these men are sleeping with?"
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd \u2014 basic math!
p300
aa(lp301
VAnyway.
p302
aVIn the Western world,
p303
aVwomen start sooner at sex, have more partners,
p304
aVexpress less remorse for the partners that they do,
p305
aVmarry later, have fewer children,
p306
aVleave bad marriages in order to get good ones.
p307
aVWe are seeing the rise of female sexual expression.
p308
aVAnd, indeed, once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression
p309
aVthat we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago,
p310
aVbecause this is the kind of sexual expression that we see
p311
aVin hunting and gathering societies today.
p312
aa(lp313
VWe're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality.
p314
aVThey're now saying that the 21st century
p315
aVis going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage,"
p316
aVor the "pure marriage," or the "companionate marriage."
p317
aVThis is a marriage between equals,
p318
aVmoving forward to a pattern
p319
aVthat is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit.
p320
aa(lp321
VWe're also seeing a rise of romantic love.
p322
aV91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men
p323
aVwould not marry somebody who had every single quality
p324
aVthey were looking for in a partner,
p325
aVif they were not in love with that person.
p326
aVPeople around the world, in a study of 37 societies,
p327
aVwant to be in love with the person that they marry.
p328
aVIndeed, arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life.
p329
aa(lp330
VI even think that marriages might even become more stable
p331
aVbecause of the second great world trend.
p332
aVThe first one being women moving into the job market,
p333
aVthe second one being the aging world population.
p334
aVThey're now saying that in America,
p335
aVthat middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.
p336
aVBecause in that highest age category of 76 to 85,
p337
aVas much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them.
p338
aVSo we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.
p339
aa(lp340
VFor one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.
p341
aVAnd as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.
p342
aVSo the divorce rate right now is stable in America,
p343
aVand it's actually beginning to decline.
p344
aVIt may decline some more.
p345
aVI would even say that with Viagra,
p346
aVestrogen replacement, hip replacements
p347
aVand the incredibly interesting women
p348
aV\u2014 women have never been as interesting as they are now.
p349
aVNot at any time on this planet have women been so educated,
p350
aVso interesting, so capable.
p351
aVAnd so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution
p352
aVwhen we have the opportunity to make good marriages, that time is now.
p353
aa(lp354
VHowever, there's always kinds of complications in this.
p355
aVThese three brain systems \u2014 lust, romantic love and attachment \u2014
p356
aVdon't always go together.
p357
aVThey can go together, by the way.
p358
aVThat's why casual sex isn't so casual.
p359
aVWith orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.
p360
aVDopamine's associated with romantic love,
p361
aVand you can just fall in love with somebody
p362
aVwho you're just having casual sex with.
p363
aVWith orgasm, then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin \u2014
p364
aVthose are associated with attachment.
p365
aVThis is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody
p366
aVafter you've made love to them.
p367
aa(lp368
VBut these three brain systems: lust, romantic love and attachment,
p369
aVaren't always connected to each other.
p370
aVYou can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner
p371
aVwhile you feel intense romantic love for somebody else,
p372
aVwhile you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.
p373
aVIn short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.
p374
aVIn fact, you can lie in bed at night
p375
aVand swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person
p376
aVto deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else.
p377
aVIt's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head
p378
aVas you are trying to decide what to do.
p379
aVSo I don't think, honestly,
p380
aVwe're an animal that was built to be happy;
p381
aVwe are an animal that was built to reproduce.
p382
aVI think the happiness we find, we make.
p383
aVAnd I think, however,
p384
aVwe can make good relationships with each other.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo I want to conclude with two things.
p387
aVI want to conclude with a worry,
p388
aVand with a wonderful story.
p389
aVThe worry is about antidepressants.
p390
aVOver 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants
p391
aVare written every year in the United States.
p392
aVAnd these drugs are going generic.
p393
aVThey are seeping around the world.
p394
aVI know one girl who's been on these antidepressants,
p395
aVSSRIs, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants \u2014 since she was 13.
p396
aVShe's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13.
p397
aa(lp398
VI've got nothing against people who take them short term,
p399
aVwhen they're going through something horrible.
p400
aVThey want to commit suicide or kill somebody else.
p401
aVI would recommend it.
p402
aVBut more and more people in the United States
p403
aVare taking them long term.
p404
aVAnd indeed, what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin.
p405
aVAnd by raising levels of serotonin, you suppress the dopamine circuit.
p406
aVEverybody knows that.
p407
aVDopamine is associated with romantic love.
p408
aVNot only do they suppress the dopamine circuit,
p409
aVbut they kill the sex drive.
p410
aVAnd when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.
p411
aVAnd when you kill orgasm,
p412
aVyou kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment.
p413
aVThe things are connected in the brain.
p414
aVAnd when you tamper with one brain system,
p415
aVyou're going to tamper with another.
p416
aVI'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.
p417
aa(lp418
VSo now \u2014
p419
aa(lp420
V(Applause)
p421
aa(lp422
VThank you.
p423
aa(lp424
VI want to end with a story.
p425
aVAnd then, just a comment.
p426
aVI've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years.
p427
aVI'm an identical twin; I am interested in why we're all alike.
p428
aVWhy you and I are alike, why the Iraqis and the Japanese
p429
aVand the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River
p430
aVare all alike.
p431
aVAnd about a year ago,
p432
aVan Internet dating service, Match.com, came to me
p433
aVand asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.
p434
aVI said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know?
p435
aVI don't know. Do you think you've got the right person?"
p436
aVThey said, "Yes."
p437
aVIt got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love
p438
aVwith one person rather than another.
p439
aa(lp440
VThat's my current project; it will be my next book.
p441
aVThere's all kinds of reasons
p442
aVthat you fall in love with one person rather than another.
p443
aVTiming is important. Proximity is important.
p444
aVMystery is important.
p445
aVYou fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious,
p446
aVin part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain,
p447
aVprobably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love.
p448
aVYou fall in love with somebody
p449
aVwho fits within what I call your "love map,"
p450
aVan unconscious list of traits
p451
aVthat you build in childhood as you grow up.
p452
aVAnd I also think that you gravitate to certain people,
p453
aVactually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.
p454
aVAnd that's what I'm now contributing to this.
p455
aa(lp456
VBut I want to tell you a story, to illustrate.
p457
aVI've been carrying on here about the biology of love.
p458
aVI wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too,
p459
aVthe magic of it.
p460
aVIt's a story that was told to me
p461
aVby somebody who had heard it just from one \u2014
p462
aVprobably a true story.
p463
aVIt was a graduate student \u2014 I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues \u2014
p464
aVArt Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.
p465
aVThat's where we put our people in the MRI machine.
p466
aa(lp467
VAnd this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student,
p468
aVand she was not in love with him.
p469
aVAnd they were all at a conference in Beijing.
p470
aVAnd he knew from our work
p471
aVthat if you go and do something very novel with somebody,
p472
aVyou can drive up the dopamine in the brain,
p473
aVand perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love.
p474
aa(lp475
V(Laughter)
p476
aa(lp477
VSo he decided he'd put science to work.
p478
aVAnd he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him.
p479
aa(lp480
VAnd sure enough \u2014 I've never been in one,
p481
aVbut apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks
p482
aVand it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting.
p483
aVHe figured that this would drive up the dopamine,
p484
aVand she'd fall in love with him.
p485
aVSo off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him
p486
aVand laughing and having a wonderful time.
p487
aVAn hour later they get down off of the rickshaw,
p488
aVand she throws her hands up and she says,
p489
aV"Wasn't that wonderful?"
p490
aVAnd, "Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome!"
p491
aa(lp492
V(Laughter)
p493
aa(lp494
V(Applause)
p495
aa(lp496
VThere's magic to love!
p497
aa(lp498
V(Applause)
p499
aa(lp500
VBut I will end by saying that millions of years ago,
p501
aVwe evolved three basic drives:
p502
aVthe sex drive, romantic love
p503
aVand attachment to a long-term partner.
p504
aVThese circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain.
p505
aVThey're going to survive as long as our species survives
p506
aVon what Shakespeare called "this mortal coil."
p507
aa(lp508
VThank you.
p509

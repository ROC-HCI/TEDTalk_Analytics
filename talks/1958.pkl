VMy job at Twitter
p5
aVis to ensure user trust,
p6
aVprotect user rights and keep users safe,
p7
aVboth from each other
p8
aVand, at times, from themselves.
p9
aVLet's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter.
p10
aVBack in January 2009,
p11
aVwe saw more than two million new tweets each day
p12
aVon the platform.
p13
aVJanuary 2014, more than 500 million.
p14
aVWe were seeing two million tweets
p15
aVin less than six minutes.
p16
aVThat's a 24,900-percent increase.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, the vast majority of activity on Twitter
p19
aVputs no one in harm's way.
p20
aVThere's no risk involved.
p21
aVMy job is to root out and prevent activity that might.
p22
aVSounds straightforward, right?
p23
aVYou might even think it'd be easy,
p24
aVgiven that I just said the vast majority
p25
aVof activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.
p26
aVWhy spend so much time
p27
aVsearching for potential calamities
p28
aVin innocuous activities?
p29
aVGiven the scale that Twitter is at,
p30
aVa one-in-a-million chance happens
p31
aV500 times a day.
p32
aVIt's the same for other companies
p33
aVdealing at this sort of scale.
p34
aVFor us, edge cases,
p35
aVthose rare situations that are unlikely to occur,
p36
aVare more like norms.
p37
aVSay 99.999 percent of tweets
p38
aVpose no risk to anyone.
p39
aVThere's no threat involved.
p40
aVMaybe people are documenting travel landmarks
p41
aVlike Australia's Heart Reef,
p42
aVor tweeting about a concert they're attending,
p43
aVor sharing pictures of cute baby animals.
p44
aVAfter you take out that 99.999 percent,
p45
aVthat tiny percentage of tweets remaining
p46
aVworks out to roughly
p47
aV150,000 per month.
p48
aVThe sheer scale of what we're dealing with
p49
aVmakes for a challenge.
p50
aa(lp51
VYou know what else makes my role
p52
aVparticularly challenging?
p53
aVPeople do weird things.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVAnd I have to figure out what they're doing,
p56
aVwhy, and whether or not there's risk involved,
p57
aVoften without much in terms of context
p58
aVor background.
p59
aVI'm going to show you some examples
p60
aVthat I've run into during my time at Twitter \u2014
p61
aVthese are all real examples \u2014
p62
aVof situations that at first seemed cut and dried,
p63
aVbut the truth of the matter was something
p64
aValtogether different.
p65
aVThe details have been changed
p66
aVto protect the innocent
p67
aVand sometimes the guilty.
p68
aVWe'll start off easy.
p69
aa(lp70
V["Yo bitch"]
p71
aa(lp72
VIf you saw a Tweet that only said this,
p73
aVyou might think to yourself,
p74
aV"That looks like abuse."
p75
aVAfter all, why would you want to receive the message,
p76
aV"Yo, bitch."
p77
aVNow, I try to stay relatively hip
p78
aVto the latest trends and memes,
p79
aVso I knew that "yo, bitch"
p80
aVwas also often a common greeting between friends,
p81
aVas well as being a popular "Breaking Bad" reference.
p82
aVI will admit that I did not expect
p83
aVto encounter a fourth use case.
p84
aVIt turns out it is also used on Twitter
p85
aVwhen people are role-playing as dogs.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVAnd in fact, in that case,
p88
aVit's not only not abusive,
p89
aVit's technically just an accurate greeting.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VSo okay, determining whether or not
p93
aVsomething is abusive without context,
p94
aVdefinitely hard.
p95
aa(lp96
VLet's look at spam.
p97
aVHere's an example of an account engaged
p98
aVin classic spammer behavior,
p99
aVsending the exact same message
p100
aVto thousands of people.
p101
aVWhile this is a mockup I put together using my account,
p102
aVwe see accounts doing this all the time.
p103
aVSeems pretty straightforward.
p104
aVWe should just automatically suspend accounts
p105
aVengaging in this kind of behavior.
p106
aVTurns out there's some exceptions to that rule.
p107
aVTurns out that that message could also be a notification
p108
aVyou signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead
p109
aVbecause you wanted to go outside
p110
aVand see if you could see it.
p111
aVYou're not going to get that chance
p112
aVif we mistakenly suspend the account
p113
aVthinking it's spam.
p114
aa(lp115
VOkay. Let's make the stakes higher.
p116
aVBack to my account,
p117
aVagain exhibiting classic behavior.
p118
aVThis time it's sending the same message and link.
p119
aVThis is often indicative of  something called phishing,
p120
aVsomebody trying to steal another person's account information
p121
aVby directing them to another website.
p122
aVThat's pretty clearly not a good thing.
p123
aVWe want to, and do, suspend accounts
p124
aVengaging in that kind of behavior.
p125
aVSo why are the stakes higher for this?
p126
aVWell, this could also be a bystander at a rally
p127
aVwho managed to record a video
p128
aVof a police officer beating a non-violent protester
p129
aVwho's trying to let the world know what's happening.
p130
aVWe don't want to gamble
p131
aVon potentially silencing that crucial speech
p132
aVby classifying it as spam and suspending it.
p133
aVThat means we evaluate hundreds of parameters
p134
aVwhen looking at account behaviors,
p135
aVand even then, we can still get it wrong
p136
aVand have to reevaluate.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, given the sorts of challenges I'm up against,
p139
aVit's crucial that I not only predict
p140
aVbut also design protections for the unexpected.
p141
aVAnd that's not just an issue for me,
p142
aVor for Twitter, it's an issue for you.
p143
aVIt's an issue for anybody who's building or creating
p144
aVsomething that you think is going to be amazing
p145
aVand will let people do awesome things.
p146
aVSo what do I do?
p147
aVI pause and I think,
p148
aVhow could all of this
p149
aVgo horribly wrong?
p150
aVI visualize catastrophe.
p151
aVAnd that's hard. There's a sort of
p152
aVinherent cognitive dissonance in doing that,
p153
aVlike when you're writing your wedding vows
p154
aVat the same time as your prenuptial agreement.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVBut you still have to do it,
p157
aVparticularly if you're marrying  500 million tweets per day.
p158
aVWhat do I mean by "visualize catastrophe?"
p159
aVI try to think of how something as
p160
aVbenign and innocuous as a picture of a cat
p161
aVcould lead to death,
p162
aVand what to do to prevent that.
p163
aVWhich happens to be my next example.
p164
aVThis is my cat, Eli.
p165
aVWe wanted to give users the ability
p166
aVto add photos to their tweets.
p167
aVA picture is worth a thousand words.
p168
aVYou only get 140 characters.
p169
aVYou add a photo to your tweet,
p170
aVlook at how much more content you've got now.
p171
aVThere's all sorts of great things you can do
p172
aVby adding a photo to a tweet.
p173
aVMy job isn't to think of those.
p174
aVIt's to think of what could go wrong.
p175
aa(lp176
VHow could this picture
p177
aVlead to my death?
p178
aVWell, here's one possibility.
p179
aVThere's more in that picture than just a cat.
p180
aVThere's geodata.
p181
aVWhen you take a picture with your smartphone
p182
aVor digital camera,
p183
aVthere's a lot of additional information
p184
aVsaved along in that image.
p185
aVIn fact, this image also contains
p186
aVthe equivalent of this,
p187
aVmore specifically, this.
p188
aVSure, it's not likely that someone's going to try
p189
aVto track me down and do me harm
p190
aVbased upon image data associated
p191
aVwith a picture I took of my cat,
p192
aVbut I start by assuming the worst will happen.
p193
aVThat's why, when we launched photos on Twitter,
p194
aVwe made the decision to strip that geodata out.
p195
aV(Applause)
p196
aVIf I start by assuming the worst
p197
aVand work backwards,
p198
aVI can make sure that the protections we build
p199
aVwork for both expected
p200
aVand unexpected use cases.
p201
aa(lp202
VGiven that I spend my days and nights
p203
aVimagining the worst that could happen,
p204
aVit wouldn't be surprising if  my worldview was gloomy.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVIt's not.
p207
aVThe vast majority of interactions I see \u2014
p208
aVand I see a lot, believe me \u2014 are positive,
p209
aVpeople reaching out to help
p210
aVor to connect or share information with each other.
p211
aVIt's just that for those of us dealing with scale,
p212
aVfor those of us tasked with keeping people safe,
p213
aVwe have to assume the worst will happen,
p214
aVbecause for us, a one-in-a-million chance
p215
aVis pretty good odds.
p216
aa(lp217
VThank you.

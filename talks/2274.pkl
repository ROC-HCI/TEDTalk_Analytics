VIn the great 1980s movie  "The Blues Brothers,"
p5
aVthere's a scene where John Belushi goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment
p6
aVin Chicago for the very first time.
p7
aVIt's a cramped, tiny space
p8
aVand it's just three feet away from the train tracks.
p9
aVAs John sits on Dan's bed,
p10
aVa train goes rushing by,
p11
aVrattling everything in the room.
p12
aVJohn asks, "How often does that train go by?"
p13
aVDan replies, "So often, you won't even notice it."
p14
aVAnd then, something falls off the wall.
p15
aa(lp16
VWe all know what he's talking about.
p17
aVAs human beings, we get used to everyday things
p18
aVreally fast.
p19
aVAs a product designer, it's my job to see those everyday things,
p20
aVto feel them, and try to improve upon them.
p21
aVFor example, see this piece of fruit?
p22
aVSee this little sticker?
p23
aVThat sticker wasn't there when I was a kid.
p24
aVBut somewhere as the years passed,
p25
aVsomeone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit.
p26
aVWhy?
p27
aVSo it could be easier for us
p28
aVto check out  at the grocery counter.
p29
aa(lp30
VWell that's great,
p31
aVwe can get in and out of the store quickly.
p32
aVBut now, there's a new problem.
p33
aVWhen we get home and we're hungry
p34
aVand we see this ripe, juicy piece of fruit on the counter,
p35
aVwe just want to pick it up and eat it.
p36
aVExcept now, we have to look for this little sticker.
p37
aVAnd dig at it with our nails, damaging the flesh.
p38
aVThen rolling up that sticker \u2014
p39
aVyou know what I mean.
p40
aVAnd then trying to flick it off your fingers.
p41
aV(Applause)
p42
aVIt's not fun,
p43
aVnot at all.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut something interesting happened.
p46
aVSee the first time you did it, you probably felt those feelings.
p47
aVYou just wanted to eat the piece of fruit.
p48
aVYou felt upset.
p49
aVYou just wanted to dive in.
p50
aVBy the 10th time,
p51
aVyou started to become less upset
p52
aVand you just started peeling the label off.
p53
aVBy the 100th time, at least for me,
p54
aVI became numb to it.
p55
aVI simply picked up the piece of fruit,
p56
aVdug at it with my nails, tried to flick it off,
p57
aVand then wondered,
p58
aV"Was there another sticker?"
p59
aa(lp60
VSo why is that?
p61
aVWhy do we get used to everyday things?
p62
aVWell as human beings, we have limited brain power.
p63
aVAnd so our brains encode the  everyday things we do into habits
p64
aVso we can free up space  to learn new things.
p65
aVIt's a process called habituation
p66
aVand it's one of the most basic ways, as humans, we learn.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, habituation isn't always bad.
p69
aVRemember learning to drive?
p70
aVI sure do.
p71
aVYour hands clenched at 10 and 2 on the wheel,
p72
aVlooking at every single object out there \u2014
p73
aVthe cars, the lights, the pedestrians.
p74
aVIt's a nerve-wracking experience.
p75
aVSo much so, that I couldn't even talk to anyone else in the car
p76
aVand I couldn't even listen to music.
p77
aVBut then something interesting happened.
p78
aVAs the weeks went by, driving became easier and easier.
p79
aVYou habituated it.
p80
aVIt started to become  fun and second nature.
p81
aVAnd then, you could talk  to your friends again
p82
aVand listen to music.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo there's a good reason why our brains habituate things.
p85
aVIf we didn't, we'd notice every little detail,
p86
aVall the time.
p87
aVIt would be exhausting,
p88
aVand we'd have no time to learn about new things.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut sometimes, habituation isn't good.
p91
aVIf it stops us from noticing  the problems that are around us,
p92
aVwell, that's bad.
p93
aVAnd if it stops us from noticing  and fixing those problems,
p94
aVwell, then that's really bad.
p95
aa(lp96
VComedians know all about this.
p97
aVJerry Seinfeld's entire career was built on noticing those little details,
p98
aVthose idiotic things we do every day that we don't even remember.
p99
aVHe tells us about the time  he visited his friends
p100
aVand he just wanted to take  a comfortable shower.
p101
aVHe'd reach out and grab the handle and turn it slightly one way,
p102
aVand it was 100 degrees too hot.
p103
aVAnd then he'd turn it the other way, and it was 100 degrees too cold.
p104
aVHe just wanted a comfortable shower.
p105
aVNow, we've all been there,
p106
aVwe just don't remember it.
p107
aVBut Jerry did,
p108
aVand that's a comedian's job.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut designers, innovators  and entrepreneurs,
p111
aVit's our job to not just notice those things,
p112
aVbut to go one step further and try to fix them.
p113
aa(lp114
VSee this, this person,
p115
aVthis is Mary Anderson.
p116
aVIn 1902 in New York City,
p117
aVshe was visiting.
p118
aVIt was a cold, wet, snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar.
p119
aVAs she was going to her destination, she noticed the driver opening the window
p120
aVto clean off the excess snow so he could drive safely.
p121
aVWhen he opened the window, though, he let all this cold, wet air inside,
p122
aVmaking all the passengers miserable.
p123
aVNow probably, most of those  passengers just thought,
p124
aV"It's a fact of life, he's got to open the window to clean it.
p125
aVThat's just how it is."
p126
aVBut Mary didn't.
p127
aVMary thought,
p128
aV"What if the diver could actually clean the windshield from the inside
p129
aVso that he could stay safe and drive
p130
aVand the passengers could  actually stay warm?"
p131
aVSo she picked up her sketchbook right then and there,
p132
aVand began drawing what would become the world's first windshield wiper.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow as a product designer, I try to learn from people like Mary
p135
aVto try to see the world  the way it really is,
p136
aVnot the way we think it is.
p137
aVWhy?
p138
aVBecause it's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees.
p139
aVBut it's hard to solve a problem that almost no one sees.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow some people think you're born with this ability
p142
aVor you're not,
p143
aVas if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth to see the world more clearly.
p144
aVThat wasn't the case for me.
p145
aVI had to work at it.
p146
aVDuring my years at Apple,
p147
aVSteve Jobs challenged us to come into work every day,
p148
aVto see our products through  the eyes of the customer,
p149
aVthe new customer,
p150
aVthe one that has fears  and possible frustrations
p151
aVand hopeful exhilaration that their new technology product
p152
aVcould work straightaway for them.
p153
aVHe called it staying beginners,
p154
aVand wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details
p155
aVto make them faster, easier and seamless for the new customers.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo I remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the iPod.
p158
aVSee, back in the '90s,
p159
aVbeing a gadget freak like I am,
p160
aVI would rush out to the store for the very, very latest gadget.
p161
aVI'd take all the time to get to the store,
p162
aVI'd check out, I'd come back home, I'd start to unbox it.
p163
aVAnd then, there was  another little sticker:
p164
aVthe one that said, "Charge before use."
p165
aa(lp166
VWhat!
p167
aVI can't believe it!
p168
aVI just spent all this time buying this product
p169
aVand now I have to charge before use.
p170
aVI have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that coveted new toy.
p171
aVIt was crazy.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut you know what?
p174
aVAlmost every product back then did that.
p175
aVWhen it had batteries in it,
p176
aVyou had to charge it before you used it.
p177
aVWell, Steve noticed that
p178
aVand he said,
p179
aV"We're not going to let that  happen to our product."
p180
aVSo what did we do?
p181
aVTypically, when you have a product that has a hard drive in it,
p182
aVyou run it for about  30 minutes in the factory
p183
aVto make sure that hard drive's going  to be working years later
p184
aVfor the customer after they  pull it out of the box.
p185
aVWhat did we do instead?
p186
aVWe ran that product for over two hours.
p187
aVWhy?
p188
aVWell, first off, we could make a higher quality product,
p189
aVbe easy to test,
p190
aVand make sure it was great for the customer.
p191
aVBut most importantly,
p192
aVthe battery came fully charged right out of the box,
p193
aVready to use.
p194
aVSo that customer,  with all that exhilaration,
p195
aVcould just start using the product.
p196
aVIt was great, and it worked.
p197
aVPeople liked it.
p198
aa(lp199
VToday, almost every product that you get that's battery powered
p200
aVcomes out of the box fully charged,
p201
aVeven if it doesn't have a hard drive.
p202
aVBut back then, we noticed  that detail and we fixed it,
p203
aVand now everyone else does that as well.
p204
aVNo more, "Charge before use."
p205
aa(lp206
VSo why am I telling you this?
p207
aVWell, it's seeing the invisible problem,
p208
aVnot just the obvious problem, that's important,
p209
aVnot just for product design, but for everything we do.
p210
aVYou see, there are invisible problems all around us,
p211
aVones we can solve.
p212
aVBut first we need to see them, to feel them.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo, I'm hesitant to give you any tips
p215
aVabout neuroscience or psychology.
p216
aVThere's far too many experienced people in the TED community
p217
aVwho would know much more about that than I ever will.
p218
aVBut let me leave you with a few tips that I do,
p219
aVthat we all can do, to fight habituation.
p220
aa(lp221
VMy first tip is to look broader.
p222
aVYou see, when you're tackling a problem,
p223
aVsometimes, there are a lot of steps that lead up to that problem.
p224
aVAnd sometimes, a lot  of steps after it.
p225
aVIf you can take a step back and look broader,
p226
aVmaybe you can change some of those boxes
p227
aVbefore the problem.
p228
aVMaybe you can combine them.
p229
aVMaybe you can remove them altogether to make that better.
p230
aa(lp231
VTake thermostats, for instance.
p232
aVIn the 1900s when they first came out, they were really simple to use.
p233
aVYou could turn them up or turn them down.
p234
aVPeople understood them.
p235
aVBut in the 1970s,
p236
aVthe energy crisis struck,
p237
aVand customers started thinking about how to save energy.
p238
aVSo what happened?
p239
aVThermostat designers decided  to add a new step.
p240
aVInstead of just turning up and down,
p241
aVyou now had to program it.
p242
aVSo you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time.
p243
aVNow that seemed great.
p244
aVEvery thermostat had started adding that feature.
p245
aVBut it turned out that no one saved any energy.
p246
aVNow, why is that?
p247
aVWell, people couldn't predict the future.
p248
aVThey just didn't know how their weeks would change season to season,
p249
aVyear to year.
p250
aVSo no one was saving energy,
p251
aVand what happened?
p252
aa(lp253
VThermostat designers went back to the drawing board
p254
aVand they focused on that programming step.
p255
aVThey made better U.I.s,
p256
aVthey made better documentation.
p257
aVBut still, years later, people were not saving any energy
p258
aVbecause they just couldn't predict the future.
p259
aVSo what did we do?
p260
aVWe put a machine-learning algorithm in instead of the programming
p261
aVthat would simply watch when you turned it up and down,
p262
aVwhen you liked a certain temperature when you got up,
p263
aVor when you went away.
p264
aVAnd you know what?
p265
aVIt worked.
p266
aVPeople are saving energy  without any programming.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo, it doesn't matter what you're doing.
p269
aVIf you take a step back  and look at all the boxes,
p270
aVmaybe there's a way to remove one or combine them
p271
aVso that you can make  that process much simpler.
p272
aVSo that's my first tip: look broader.
p273
aa(lp274
VFor my second tip, it's to look closer.
p275
aVOne of my greatest teachers  was my grandfather.
p276
aVHe taught me all about the world.
p277
aVHe taught me how things were built and how they were repaired,
p278
aVthe tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project.
p279
aVI remember one story  he told me about screws,
p280
aVand about how you need to have the right screw for the right job.
p281
aVThere are many different screws:
p282
aVwood screws, metal screws, anchors, concrete screws,
p283
aVthe list went on and on.
p284
aVOur job is to make products that are easy to install
p285
aVfor all of our customs themselves without professionals.
p286
aVSo what did we do?
p287
aVI remembered that story  that my grandfather told me,
p288
aVand so we thought,
p289
aV"How many different screws  can we put in the box?
p290
aVWas it going to be two, three, four, five?
p291
aVBecause there's so many different wall types."
p292
aVSo we thought about it, we optimized it,
p293
aVand we came up with three different screws to put in the box.
p294
aVWe thought that was going to solve the problem.
p295
aVBut it turned out, it didn't.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo we shipped the product,
p298
aVand people weren't having a great experience.
p299
aVSo what did we do?
p300
aVWe went back to the drawing board
p301
aVjust instantly after we figured out we didn't get it right.
p302
aVAnd we designed a special screw, a custom screw,
p303
aVmuch to the chagrin of our investors.
p304
aVThey were like, "Why are you spending so much time on a little screw?
p305
aVGet out there and sell more!"
p306
aVAnd we said, "We will sell more if we get this right."
p307
aVAnd it turned out, we did.
p308
aVWith that custom little screw, there was just one screw in the box,
p309
aVthat was easy to mount and put on the wall.
p310
aa(lp311
VSo if we focus on those tiny details, the ones we may not see
p312
aVand we look at them as we say,
p313
aV"Are those important
p314
aVor is that the way we've always done it?
p315
aVMaybe there's a way to get rid of those."
p316
aa(lp317
VSo my last piece of advice is to think younger.
p318
aVEvery day, I'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids.
p319
aVThey come up with questions like,
p320
aV"Why can't cars fly around traffic?"
p321
aVOr, "Why don't my shoelaces have Velcro instead?"
p322
aVSometimes, those questions are smart.
p323
aVMy son came to me the other day and I asked him,
p324
aV"Go run out to the mailbox  and check it."
p325
aVHe looked at me, puzzled, and said,
p326
aV"Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail?" (Laughter)
p327
aVI was like, "That's a pretty  good question."
p328
aVSo, they can ask tons of questions
p329
aVand sometimes we find out we just don't have the right answers.
p330
aVWe say, "Son, that's just the way the world works."
p331
aVSo the more we're exposed to something,
p332
aVthe more we get used to it.
p333
aVBut kids haven't been around  long enough
p334
aVto get used to those things.
p335
aVAnd so when they run into problems,
p336
aVthey immediately try to solve them,
p337
aVand sometimes they find a better way,
p338
aVand that way really is better.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team,
p341
aVor people with young minds.
p342
aVBecause if you have those young minds,
p343
aVthey cause everyone in the room to think younger.
p344
aVPicasso once said,  "Every child is an artist.
p345
aVThe problem is when he or she grows up, is how to remain an artist."
p346
aVWe all saw the world more clearly when we saw it for the first time,
p347
aVbefore a lifetime of habits  got in the way.
p348
aVOur challenge is to get back there,
p349
aVto feel that frustration,
p350
aVto see those little details,
p351
aVto look broader,
p352
aVlook closer,
p353
aVand to think younger
p354
aVso we can stay beginners.
p355
aa(lp356
VIt's not easy.
p357
aVIt requires us pushing back
p358
aVagainst one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world.
p359
aVBut if we do,
p360
aVwe could do some pretty amazing things.
p361
aVFor me, hopefully, that's better product design.
p362
aVFor you, that could mean something else, something powerful.
p363
aa(lp364
VOur challenge is to wake up  each day and say,
p365
aV"How can I experience the world better?"
p366
aVAnd if we do, maybe, just maybe,
p367
aVwe can get rid of these dumb little stickers.
p368
aa(lp369
VThank you very much.

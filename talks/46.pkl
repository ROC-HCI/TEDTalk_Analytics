aa(lp8
V(Applause)
p9
aa(lp10
VThank you!
p11
aa(lp12
V(Applause continues)
p13
aa(lp14
VThank you very much.
p15
aVLike the speaker before me \u2014 I am a TED virgin, I guess.
p16
aVI'm also the first time here, and ...
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VI don't know what to say!
p21
aa(lp22
V(Applause)
p23
aa(lp24
VI'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me.
p25
aVI'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.
p26
aVAnd the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann.
p27
aVIt's called "Kaleidoscope."
p28
aVAnd Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century,
p29
aVand he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.
p30
aa(lp31
VI have another piece that I'd like to play for you.
p32
aVIt's called "Abegg Variations," by Robert Schumann,
p33
aVa German 19th-century composer.
p34
aVThe name "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G,
p35
aVand that's the main theme in the melody.
p36
aV(Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G)
p37
aVThat comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VBut he wrote that for his wife.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VSo actually, if you listen carefully,
p46
aVthere are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.
p47
aVIt's written around 1834,
p48
aVso even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Music)
p51
aa(lp52
V(Music ends)
p53
aa(lp54
V(Applause)
p55
aa(lp56
VNow comes the part that I hate.
p57
aVWell, because Mr. Anderson told me
p58
aVthat this session is called "Sync and Flow,"
p59
aVI was wondering, "What do I know that these geniuses don't?"
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VSo, I'll talk about musical composition,
p64
aVeven though I don't know where to start.
p65
aa(lp66
VHow do I compose?
p67
aVI think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.
p68
aVWhat I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas
p69
aVyou can just improvise here at the piano \u2014
p70
aVand I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody,
p71
aVlike the Abegg that you just heard.
p72
aVAnd once I choose my main theme, I have to decide:
p73
aVOut of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want?
p74
aVAnd this year, I composed a Romantic style.
p75
aVSo for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky
p76
aVand all the great Romantic composers.
p77
aa(lp78
VNext, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers.
p79
aVThey help me plan out the whole piece.
p80
aVAnd then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas,
p81
aVbecause then you have to think.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form \u2014
p86
aVsolidified, excuse me \u2014 solidified form,
p87
aVyou're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details,
p88
aVand then polish the overall performance of the composition.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing.
p91
aVDrawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art.
p92
aVI think that's a craze among teens right now.
p93
aVAnd once I realized it,
p94
aVthere's a parallel between creating music and creating art,
p95
aVbecause for your motive, or your little initial idea for your drawing,
p96
aVit's your character \u2014 you want to decide who you want to draw,
p97
aVor if you want to draw an original character.
p98
aVAnd then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character?
p99
aVLike, am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer?
p100
aVAm I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book?
p101
aVFor a more grandiose effect, I guess.
p102
aVAnd then you have to do the initial sketch of the character,
p103
aVwhich is like your structure of a piece,
p104
aVand then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need \u2014
p105
aVthat's polishing the drawing.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind,
p108
aVbecause I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted.
p109
aVSo if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it,
p110
aVI'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time.
p111
aVAnd then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw
p112
aVor I can't compose at all,
p113
aVand then it's like there's too much on your mind.
p114
aVYou can't focus on what you're supposed to do.
p115
aVAnd sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it,
p116
aVyou'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.
p117
aa(lp118
VWhat happens is, if something magical happens,
p119
aVif something natural happens to you,
p120
aVyou're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly,
p121
aVand then that's what I consider "flow,"
p122
aVbecause that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything.
p123
aVYou feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.
p124
aa(lp125
VI'm not going to play my own composition today because,
p126
aValthough I did finish it, it's way too long.
p127
aVInstead, I'd like to try something called "improvisation."
p128
aVI have here seven note cards,
p129
aVone with each note of the musical alphabet.
p130
aVAnd I'd like someone to come up here and choose five \u2014
p131
aVanyone to come up here and choose five \u2014
p132
aVand then I can make it into some sort of melody,
p133
aVand I'll improvise it.
p134
aVWow. A volunteer, yay!
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
V(Applause)
p139
aa(lp140
VJennifer Lin: Nice to meet you.
p141
aa(lp142
VGoldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five?
p143
aa(lp144
VJL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.
p145
aa(lp146
VGH: OK, one. JL: OK.
p147
aa(lp148
VGH: Two. JL: Yes.
p149
aa(lp150
VGH: Three.
p151
aa(lp152
VGH: Oh, D and F \u2014 too familiar.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VJL: One more. GH: OK. "E" for "effort."
p157
aa(lp158
VJL: Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?
p159
aa(lp160
VGH: OK \u2014 C, G, B, A and E.
p161
aa(lp162
VJL: Thank you very much!
p163
aa(lp164
VGH: You're welcome. And what about these?
p165
aa(lp166
VJL: I won't use them. Thank you!
p167
aa(lp168
V(Applause)
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, she chose C, G, B, A, E.
p171
aVI'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Plays notes)
p174
aa(lp175
VOK, that's nice.
p176
aVSo, I'm going to have a moment to think,
p177
aVand I'll try to make something out of it.

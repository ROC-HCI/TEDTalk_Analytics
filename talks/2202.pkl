VAs a software developer and technologist,
p5
aVI've worked on a number of civic technology projects
p6
aVover the years.
p7
aVCivic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good,
p8
aVusing technology to solve humanitarian problems.
p9
aa(lp10
VThis is in 2010 in Uganda,
p11
aVworking on a solution that allowed local populations
p12
aVto avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones
p13
aVfor expressing dissent.
p14
aVThat same technology was deployed later in North Africa
p15
aVfor similar purposes to help activists stay connected
p16
aVwhen governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity
p17
aVas a means of population control.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut over the years, as I have thought about these technologies
p20
aVand the things that I work on,
p21
aVa question kind of nags in the back of my mind, which is,
p22
aVwhat if we're wrong about the virtues of technology,
p23
aVand if it sometimes actively hurts
p24
aVthe communities that we're intending to help?
p25
aVThe tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions
p26
aVthat if we build great things,
p27
aVit will positively affect everyone.
p28
aVEventually, these innovations will get out and find everyone.
p29
aVBut that's not always the case.
p30
aVI like to call this blind championing of technology "trickle-down techonomics,"
p31
aVto borrow a phrase. (Laughter)
p32
aVWe tend to think that if we design things for the select few,
p33
aVeventually those technologies will reach everyone,
p34
aVand that's not always the case.
p35
aVTechnology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital.
p36
aVThey tend to consolidate in the hands of the few,
p37
aVand sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd so most of you aren't tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends,
p40
aVso I wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable.
p41
aa(lp42
VIn the world of wearables and smartphones and apps,
p43
aVthere's a big movement to track people's personal health
p44
aVwith applications that track the number of calories that you burn
p45
aVor whether you're sitting too much or walking enough.
p46
aVThese technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient,
p47
aVand in turn, these medical facilities
p48
aVare starting to expect these types of efficiencies.
p49
aVAs these digital tools find their way into medical rooms,
p50
aVand they become digitally ready,
p51
aVwhat happens to the digitally invisible?
p52
aVWhat does the medical experience look like
p53
aVfor someone who doesn't have the $400 phone or watch
p54
aVtracking their every movement?
p55
aVDo they now become a burden on the medical system?
p56
aVIs their experience changed?
p57
aa(lp58
VIn the world of finance, Bitcoin and crypto-currencies
p59
aVare revolutionizing the way we move money around the world,
p60
aVbut the challenge with these technologies
p61
aVis the barrier to entry is incredibly high, right?
p62
aVYou need access to the same phones, devices, connectivity,
p63
aVand even where you don't, where you can find a proxy agent,
p64
aVusually they require a certain amount of capital to participate.
p65
aVAnd so the question that I ask myself is, what happens to the last community
p66
aVusing paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency?
p67
aa(lp68
VAnother example from my hometown in Philadelphia:
p69
aVI recently went to the public library there,
p70
aVand they are facing an existential crisis.
p71
aVPublic funding is dwindling,
p72
aVthey have to reduce their footprint to stay open and stay relevant,
p73
aVand so one of the ways they're going about this
p74
aVis digitizing a number of the books and moving them to the cloud.
p75
aVThis is great for most kids. Right?
p76
aVYou can check out books from home,
p77
aVyou can research on the way to school or from school,
p78
aVbut these are really two big assumptions,
p79
aVthat one, you have access at home,
p80
aVand two, that you have access to a mobile phone,
p81
aVand in Philadelphia, many kids do not.
p82
aVSo what does their education experience look like
p83
aVin the wake of a completely cloud-based library,
p84
aVwhat used to be considered such a basic part of education?
p85
aVHow do they stay competitive?
p86
aa(lp87
VA final example from across the world in East Africa:
p88
aVthere's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights,
p89
aVfor a number of reasons.
p90
aVMigrant communities, older generations dying off,
p91
aVand ultimately poor record-keeping
p92
aVhave led to conflicts over who owns what.
p93
aVAnd so there was a big movement to put all this information online,
p94
aVto track all the ownership of these plots of land,
p95
aVput them in the cloud, and give them to the communities.
p96
aVBut actually, the unintended consequence of this
p97
aVhas been that venture capitalists, investors, real estate developers,
p98
aVhave swooped in and they've begun buying up these plots of land
p99
aVright out from under these communities,
p100
aVbecause they have access to the technologies
p101
aVand the connectivity that makes that possible.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo that's the common thread that connects these examples,
p104
aVthe unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make.
p105
aVAs engineers, as technologists,
p106
aVwe sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy.
p107
aVWe think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing.
p108
aVThis needs to change.
p109
aVWe have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build,
p110
aVespecially as they increasingly control the world in which we live.
p111
aVIn the late '90s,
p112
aVthere was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking.
p113
aVI think in 2014, we're long overdue for a similar movement
p114
aVin the area of tech and technology.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, I just encourage you, as you are all thinking about the next big thing,
p117
aVas entrepreneurs, as CEOs, as engineers, as makers,
p118
aVthat you think about the unintended consequences
p119
aVof the things that you're building,
p120
aVbecause the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone.
p121
aa(lp122
VThank you.

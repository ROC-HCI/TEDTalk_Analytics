VWhat I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.
p5
aVI'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" \u2014
p6
aVprobably that's also a good choice.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VBut I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world?
p10
aVAnd I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you
p11
aVto try and get out pen and paper
p12
aVbecause I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.
p13
aVSo get out your pen and paper.
p14
aVBottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.
p15
aVI'm just going to list some of them.
p16
aVThere are 800 million people starving.
p17
aVThere's a billion people without clean drinking water.
p18
aVTwo billion people without sanitation.
p19
aVThere are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS.
p20
aVThe lists go on and on.
p21
aVThere's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change \u2014 so on.
p22
aVThere are many, many problems out there.
p23
aa(lp24
VIn an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't.
p25
aVWe don't actually solve all problems.
p26
aVAnd if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves \u2014
p27
aVand that's why it's on the economy session \u2014 is to say,
p28
aVif we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves,
p29
aVwhich ones should we solve first?
p30
aVAnd that's the question I'd like to ask you.
p31
aVIf we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend
p32
aVto do good in this world, where should we spend it?
p33
aVWe identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world,
p34
aVand I will just briefly read them:
p35
aVclimate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education,
p36
aVfinancial instability, governance and corruption,
p37
aVmalnutrition and hunger, population migration,
p38
aVsanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers.
p39
aVWe believe that these in many ways
p40
aVencompass the biggest problems in the world.
p41
aVThe obvious question would be to ask,
p42
aVwhat do you think are the biggest things?
p43
aVWhere should we start on solving these problems?
p44
aVBut that's a wrong problem to ask.
p45
aVThat was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.
p46
aa(lp47
VBut of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems.
p48
aVBecause we can't solve problems.
p49
aVSurely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die.
p50
aVBut we don't have a technology to solve that, right?
p51
aVSo the point is not to prioritize problems,
p52
aVbut the point is to prioritize solutions to problems.
p53
aVAnd that would be \u2014 of course that gets a little more complicated.
p54
aVTo climate change that would be like Kyoto.
p55
aVTo communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.
p56
aVTo conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on.
p57
aVThe point that I would like to ask you to try to do,
p58
aVis just in 30 seconds \u2014 and I know this is in a sense
p59
aVan impossible task \u2014 write down what you think
p60
aVis probably some of the top priorities.
p61
aVAnd also \u2014 and that's, of course, where economics gets evil \u2014
p62
aVto put down what are the things we should not do, first.
p63
aVWhat should be at the bottom of the list?
p64
aVPlease, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor,
p65
aVand just figure out what should be the top priorities
p66
aVand the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have
p67
aVto the world's biggest issues.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe amazing part of this process \u2014 and of course, I mean,
p70
aVI would love to \u2014 I only have 18 minutes,
p71
aVI've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right?
p72
aVI'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process,
p73
aVand that's actually what we did.
p74
aVAnd I also strongly encourage you,
p75
aVand I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards,
p76
aVto think about, how do we actually prioritize?
p77
aVOf course, you have to ask yourself,
p78
aVwhy on Earth was such a list never done before?
p79
aVAnd one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable.
p80
aVNobody wants to do this.
p81
aVOf course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list.
p82
aVBut every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.
p83
aVAnd since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list
p84
aVthan there is number ones, it makes perfect sense
p85
aVnot to want to do such a list.
p86
aVWe've had the U.N. for almost 60 years,
p87
aVyet we've never actually made a fundamental list
p88
aVof all the big things that we can do in the world,
p89
aVand said, which of them should we do first?
p90
aVSo it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing \u2014
p91
aVany decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing,
p92
aVif only implicitly \u2014 and that's unlikely to be as good
p93
aVas if we actually did the prioritization,
p94
aVand went in and talked about it.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo what I'm proposing is really to say that we have,
p97
aVfor a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices.
p98
aVThere are many, many things we can do out there,
p99
aVbut we've not had the prices, nor the sizes.
p100
aVWe have not had an idea.
p101
aVImagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card,
p102
aVbut you have no idea what the price is.
p103
aVYou know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.
p104
aVIt could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.
p105
aVIt could be a family-size pizza;
p106
aVit could be a very individual-size pizza, right?
p107
aVWe'd like to know these things.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do \u2014
p110
aVto try to put prices on these issues.
p111
aVAnd so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.
p112
aVWe got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.
p113
aVSo we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.
p114
aVWhat can we do? What will be the cost
p115
aVand what will be the benefit of that?
p116
aVLikewise in communicable diseases.
p117
aVThree of the world's top experts saying, what can we do?
p118
aVWhat would be the price?
p119
aVWhat should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?
p120
aVAnd so on.
p121
aa(lp122
VThen we had some of the world's top economists,
p123
aVeight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates,
p124
aVmeet in Copenhagen in May 2004.
p125
aVWe called them the "dream team."
p126
aVThe Cambridge University prefects decided to call them
p127
aVthe Real Madrid of economics.
p128
aVThat works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here.
p129
aVAnd what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.
p130
aVAnd then you ask, why economists?
p131
aVAnd of course, I'm very happy you asked that question \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p132
aVbecause that's a very good question.
p133
aVThe point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria,
p134
aVyou ask a malaria expert.
p135
aVIf you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.
p136
aVBut if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first,
p137
aVyou can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do.
p138
aVThat is what economists do.
p139
aVThey prioritize.
p140
aVThey make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first,
p141
aVand which one should we do afterwards?
p142
aa(lp143
VSo this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you.
p144
aVOf course, you can also see it on the website,
p145
aVand we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on.
p146
aVThey basically came up with a list where they said
p147
aVthere were bad projects \u2014 basically, projects
p148
aVwhere if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.
p149
aVThen there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.
p150
aVAnd of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.
p151
aVI'm going to go from backwards
p152
aVso that we end up with the best projects.
p153
aa(lp154
VThese were the bad projects.
p155
aVAs you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.
p156
aVThis offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things
p157
aVwhere people will say I shouldn't come back, either.
p158
aVAnd I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.
p159
aVWhy is it it came up?
p160
aVAnd I'll actually also try to get back to this
p161
aVbecause it's probably one of the things
p162
aVthat we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto \u2014
p165
aVor doing something more than Kyoto \u2014 is a bad deal
p166
aVis simply because it's very inefficient.
p167
aVIt's not saying that global warming is not happening.
p168
aVIt's not saying that it's not a big problem.
p169
aVBut it's saying that what we can do about it
p170
aVis very little, at a very high cost.
p171
aVWhat they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models,
p172
aVis that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year.
p173
aVThat's a substantial amount of money.
p174
aVThat's two to three times the global development aid
p175
aVthat we give the Third World every year.
p176
aVYet it would do very little good.
p177
aVAll models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.
p178
aVSo the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.
p179
aVWhich is a little good, but not very much good.
p180
aVSo the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd just to give you a sense of reference,
p183
aVthe U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount,
p184
aVfor about 75 billion dollars a year,
p185
aVwe could solve all major basic problems in the world.
p186
aVWe could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare
p187
aVand education to every single human being on the planet.
p188
aVSo we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount
p189
aVon doing very little good?
p190
aVOr half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good?
p191
aVAnd that is really why it becomes a bad project.
p192
aVIt's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.
p193
aVBut it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority.
p194
aa(lp195
VThe fair projects \u2014 notice I'm not going to comment on all these \u2014
p196
aVbut communicable diseases, scale of basic health services \u2014 just made it,
p197
aVsimply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing.
p198
aVIt would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.
p199
aVAgain, what it tells us is suddenly
p200
aVwe start thinking about both sides of the equation.
p201
aVIf you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.
p202
aVAgain, sanitation and water is incredibly important,
p203
aVbut it also costs a lot of infrastructure.
p204
aVSo I'd like to show you the top four priorities
p205
aVwhich should be at least the first ones that we deal with
p206
aVwhen we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe fourth best problem is malaria \u2014 dealing with malaria.
p209
aVThe incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.
p210
aVIt might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP
p211
aVevery year for affected nations.
p212
aVIf we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years,
p213
aVwe could bring that incidence down to half.
p214
aVWe could avoid about 500,000 people dying,
p215
aVbut perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people
p216
aVgetting infected every year.
p217
aVWe would significantly increase their ability
p218
aVto deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with \u2014
p219
aVof course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming.
p220
aa(lp221
VThis third best one was free trade.
p222
aVBasically, the model showed that if we could get free trade,
p223
aVand especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe,
p224
aVwe could basically enliven the global economy
p225
aVto an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year,
p226
aVhalf of which would accrue to the Third World.
p227
aVAgain, the point is to say that we could actually pull
p228
aVtwo to three hundred million people out of poverty,
p229
aVvery radically fast, in about two to five years.
p230
aVThat would be the third best thing we could do.
p231
aa(lp232
VThe second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.
p233
aVNot just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way
p234
aVof dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients.
p235
aVBasically, about half of the world's population is lacking in
p236
aViron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A.
p237
aVIf we invest about 12 billion dollars,
p238
aVwe could make a severe inroad into that problem.
p239
aVThat would be the second best investment that we could do.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS.
p242
aVBasically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years,
p243
aVwe could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.
p244
aVAgain, what this does and what it focuses on is saying
p245
aVthere are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS.
p246
aVOne is treatment; the other one is prevention.
p247
aVAnd again, in an ideal world, we would do both.
p248
aVBut in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well,
p249
aVwe have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first.
p250
aVAnd treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention.
p251
aVSo basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more
p252
aVby investing in prevention.
p253
aVBasically for the amount of money that we spend,
p254
aVwe can do X amount of good in treatment,
p255
aVand 10 times as much good in prevention.
p256
aVSo again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment,
p257
aVat first rate.
p258
aa(lp259
VWhat this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities.
p260
aVI'd like to have you look at your priority list and say,
p261
aVdid you get it right?
p262
aVOr did you get close to what we came up with here?
p263
aVWell, of course, one of the things is climate change again.
p264
aVI find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.
p265
aa(lp266
VWe should also do climate change,
p267
aVif for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.
p268
aVBut of course, we don't do all problems.
p269
aVThere are many problems out there in the world.
p270
aVAnd what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems,
p271
aVthat we focus on the right ones.
p272
aVThe ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.
p273
aVAnd I think, actually \u2014 Thomas Schelling,
p274
aVone of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well.
p275
aVOne of things that people forget, is that in 100 years,
p276
aVwhen we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be,
p277
aVpeople will be much, much richer.
p278
aVEven the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
p279
aVestimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100
p280
aVwill be about as rich as we are today.
p281
aVMuch more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.
p282
aVAnd of course, we'll be even richer than that.
p283
aa(lp284
VBut the point is to say, when we talk about saving people,
p285
aVor helping people in Bangladesh in 2100,
p286
aVwe're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi.
p287
aVWe're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.
p288
aVAnd so the real point, of course, is to say,
p289
aVdo we want to spend a lot of money helping a little,
p290
aV100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy?
p291
aVOr do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh,
p292
aVwho really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply?
p293
aVOr as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich \u2014 as you will be \u2014
p294
aVa rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100,
p295
aVthinking back on 2005, and saying, "How odd that they cared so much
p296
aVabout helping me a little bit through climate change,
p297
aVand cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather
p298
aVand my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more,
p299
aVand who needed the help so much more?"
p300
aa(lp301
VSo I think that really does tell us why it is
p302
aVwe need to get our priorities straight.
p303
aVEven if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem.
p304
aVOf course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.
p305
aVWe have, you know, "The Day After Tomorrow" \u2014 it looks great, right?
p306
aVIt's a good film in the sense that
p307
aVI certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich
p308
aVto cast Brad Pitt in his next movie
p309
aVdigging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter)
p310
aVIt just doesn't make for as much of a movie.
p311
aVSo in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus
p312
aVand the whole discussion of priorities
p313
aVas a defense for boring problems.
p314
aVTo make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.
p315
aVIt's not about making things that have the most media attention,
p316
aVbut it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.
p317
aa(lp318
VThe other objections, I think, that are important to say,
p319
aVis that I'm somehow \u2014 or we are somehow \u2014 positing a false choice.
p320
aVOf course, we should do all things,
p321
aVin an ideal world \u2014 I would certainly agree.
p322
aVI think we should do all things, but we don't.
p323
aVIn 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend
p324
aVtwice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world.
p325
aVSince then our aid has halved.
p326
aVSo it doesn't look like we're actually on the path
p327
aVof suddenly solving all big problems.
p328
aa(lp329
VLikewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war?
p330
aVYou know, we spend 100 billion dollars \u2014
p331
aVwhy don't we spend that on doing good in the world?
p332
aVI'm all for that.
p333
aVIf any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.
p334
aVBut the point, of course, is still to say,
p335
aVif you get another 100 billion dollars,
p336
aVwe still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we?
p337
aVSo the real issue here is to get ourselves back
p338
aVand think about what are the right priorities.
p339
aVI should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?
p340
aVYou know, when you ask the world's best economists,
p341
aVyou inevitably end up asking old, white American men.
p342
aVAnd they're not necessarily, you know,
p343
aVgreat ways of looking at the entire world.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world
p346
aVto come and solve the same problem.
p347
aVThe only two requirements were that they were studying at the university,
p348
aVand they spoke English.
p349
aVThe majority of them were, first, from developing countries.
p350
aVThey had all the same material but they could go vastly
p351
aVoutside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did,
p352
aVto come up with their own lists.
p353
aVAnd the surprising thing was that the list was very similar \u2014
p354
aVwith malnutrition and diseases at the top
p355
aVand climate change at the bottom.
p356
aVWe've done this many other times.
p357
aVThere's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.
p358
aVThey all come out with very much the same list.
p359
aVAnd that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe
p360
aVthat there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities,
p361
aVand saying, what is the important thing in the world?
p362
aVOf course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.
p363
aVBut if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?
p364
aa(lp365
VI see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process.
p366
aVWe did it in 2004,
p367
aVand we hope to assemble many more people,
p368
aVgetting much better information for 2008, 2012.
p369
aVMap out the right path for the world \u2014
p370
aVbut also to start thinking about political triage.
p371
aVTo start thinking about saying, "Let's do
p372
aVnot the things where we can do very little at a very high cost,
p373
aVnot the things that we don't know how to do,
p374
aVbut let's do the great things where we can do an enormous
p375
aVamount of good, at very low cost, right now."
p376
aa(lp377
VAt the end of the day, you can disagree
p378
aVwith the discussion of how we actually prioritize these,
p379
aVbut we have to be honest and frank about saying,
p380
aVif there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.
p381
aVIf we worry too much about some things,
p382
aVwe end by not worrying about other things.
p383
aVSo I hope this will help us make better priorities,
p384
aVand think about how we better work for the world.
p385
aVThank you.

VShall I ask for a show of hands or a clapping
p5
aVof people in different generations?
p6
aVI'm interested in how many are three to 12 years old.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VNone, huh?
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aVAll right.
p14
aVI'm going to talk about dinosaurs.
p15
aVDo you remember dinosaurs when you were that age?
p16
aa(lp17
V(Applause)
p18
aa(lp19
VDinosaurs are kind of funny, you know.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VWe're going to kind of go in a different direction right now.
p24
aVI hope you all realize that.
p25
aVSo I'll just give you my message up front:
p26
aVTry not to go extinct.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VThat's it.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VPeople ask me a lot \u2014
p35
aVin fact, one of the most asked questions I get
p36
aVis, why do children like dinosaurs so much?
p37
aVWhat's the fascination?
p38
aVAnd I usually just say,
p39
aV"Well, dinosaurs were big,
p40
aVdifferent and gone."
p41
aVThey're all gone.
p42
aVWell that's not true,
p43
aVbut we'll get to the goose in a minute.
p44
aVSo that's sort of the theme:
p45
aVbig, different and gone.
p46
aVThe title of my talk:
p47
aVShape-shifting Dinosaurs:
p48
aVThe cause of a premature extinction.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow I assume that we remember dinosaurs.
p51
aVAnd there's lots of different shapes.
p52
aVLots of different kinds.
p53
aVA long time ago,
p54
aVback in the early 1900s, museums were out looking for dinosaurs.
p55
aVThey went out and gathered them up.
p56
aVAnd this is an interesting story.
p57
aVEvery museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had.
p58
aVSo if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one,
p59
aVthen the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one, and a better one.
p60
aVAnd that happened for all museums.
p61
aVSo everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs.
p62
aVAnd this was in the early 1900s.
p63
aa(lp64
VBy about 1970,
p65
aVsome scientists were sitting around and they thought, "What in the world \u2014
p66
aVLook at these dinosaurs, they're all big.
p67
aVWhere are all the little ones?"
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it:
p72
aV"Where are the little dinosaurs?"
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VWell, go to a museum, you'll see,
p77
aVsee how many baby dinosaurs there are.
p78
aVPeople assumed \u2014 and this was actually a problem \u2014
p79
aVpeople assumed that if they had little dinosaurs,
p80
aVif they had juvenile dinosaurs, they'd be easy to identify.
p81
aVYou'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VBut all they had were big dinosaurs.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd it comes down to a couple of things.
p88
aVFirst off, scientists have egos,
p89
aVand scientists like to name dinosaurs.
p90
aVThey like to name anything.
p91
aVEverybody likes to have their own animal that they named.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd so every time they found something that looked a little different,
p96
aVthey named it something different.
p97
aVAnd what happened, of course,
p98
aVis we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs.
p99
aa(lp100
VIn 1975,
p101
aVa light went on in somebody's head.
p102
aVDr. Peter Dodson at the University of Pennsylvania
p103
aVactually realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do,
p104
aVwhich is different than the way reptiles grow.
p105
aVAnd in fact,
p106
aVhe used the cassowary as an example.
p107
aVAnd it's kind of cool \u2014 if you look at the cassowary,
p108
aVor any of the birds that have crests on their heads,
p109
aVthey grow to about 80 percent adult size before the crest starts to grow.
p110
aVNow think about that.
p111
aVThey're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics
p112
aVvery late in what we call ontogeny.
p113
aVSo allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth.
p114
aVSo you can see that if you actually found one that was 80 percent grown
p115
aVand you didn't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary,
p116
aVyou would think they were two different animals.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo this was a problem,
p119
aVand Peter Dodson pointed this out using some duck-billed dinosaurs
p120
aVthen called Hypacrosaurus.
p121
aVAnd he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult
p122
aVand make an average of what it should look like,
p123
aVif it grew in sort of a linear fashion,
p124
aVit would have a crest about half the size of the adult.
p125
aVBut the actual subadult at 65 percent had no crest at all.
p126
aVSo this was interesting.
p127
aVSo this is where people went astray again.
p128
aVI mean, if they'd have just taken that,
p129
aVtaken Peter Dodson's work, and gone on with that,
p130
aVthen we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have.
p131
aVBut scientists have egos; they like to name things.
p132
aVAnd so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow we have a way of actually testing
p135
aVto see whether a dinosaur, or any animal, is a young one or an older one.
p136
aVAnd that's by actually cutting into their bones.
p137
aVBut cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do, as you can imagine,
p138
aVbecause in museums, bones are precious.
p139
aVYou go into a museum, and they take really good care of them.
p140
aVThey put them in foam, little containers.
p141
aVThey're very well taken care of.
p142
aVThey don't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VSo they don't normally let you do that.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VBut I have a museum and I collect dinosaurs
p151
aVand I can saw mine open.
p152
aVSo that's what I do.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Applause)
p155
aa(lp156
VSo if you cut open a little dinosaur,
p157
aVit's very spongy inside, like A.
p158
aVAnd if you cut into an older dinosaur, it's very massive.
p159
aVYou can tell it's mature bone.
p160
aVSo it's real easy to tell them apart.
p161
aVSo what I want to do is show you these.
p162
aVIn North America in the northern plains of the United States
p163
aVand the southern plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan,
p164
aVthere's this unit of rock called the Hell Creek Formation
p165
aVthat produces the last dinosaurs that lived on Earth.
p166
aVAnd there are 12 of them that everyone recognizes \u2014
p167
aVI mean the 12 primary dinosaurs that went extinct.
p168
aVAnd so we will evaluate them.
p169
aVAnd that's sort of what I've been doing.
p170
aVSo my students, my staff, we've been cutting them open.
p171
aVNow as you can imagine, cutting open a leg bone is one thing,
p172
aVbut when you go to a museum
p173
aVand say, "You don't mind if I cut open your dinosaur's skull, do you?"
p174
aVthey say, "Go away."
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VSo here are 12 dinosaurs.
p179
aVAnd we want to look at these three first.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo these are dinosaurs that are called Pachycephalosaurus.
p182
aVAnd everybody knows that these three animals are related.
p183
aVAnd the assumption is that they're related like cousins or whatever.
p184
aVBut no one ever considered that they might be more closely related.
p185
aVIn other words,
p186
aVpeople looked at them and they saw the differences.
p187
aVAnd you all know that if you are going to determine
p188
aVwhether you're related to your brother or your sister,
p189
aVyou can't do it by looking at differences.
p190
aVYou can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo people were looking at these
p193
aVand they were talking about how different they are.
p194
aVPachycephalosaurus has a big, thick dome on its head,
p195
aVand it's got some little bumps on the back of its head,
p196
aVand it's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose.
p197
aVAnd then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur from the same age, lived at the same time,
p198
aVhas spikes sticking out the back of its head.
p199
aVIt's got a little, tiny dome,
p200
aVand it's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose.
p201
aVAnd then there's this thing called Dracorex hogwartsia.
p202
aVGuess where that came from?
p203
aVDragon.
p204
aVSo here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head,
p205
aVno dome and gnarly stuff on its nose.
p206
aa(lp207
VNobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike.
p208
aVBut they did look at these three
p209
aVand they said, "These are three different dinosaurs,
p210
aVand Dracorex is probably the most primitive of them.
p211
aVAnd the other one is more primitive than the other."
p212
aVIt's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out.
p213
aVBut if you line them up,
p214
aVif you just take those three skulls and just line them up,
p215
aVthey line up like this.
p216
aVDracorex is the littlest one,
p217
aVStygimoloch is the middle-size one,
p218
aVPachycephalosaurus is the largest one.
p219
aVAnd one would think, that should give me a clue.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VBut it didn't give them a clue.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VBecause, well we know why.
p228
aVScientists like to name things.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo if we cut open Dracorex \u2014
p231
aVI cut open our Dracorex \u2014
p232
aVand look, it was spongy inside, really spongy inside.
p233
aVI mean, it is a juvenile and it's growing really fast.
p234
aVSo it is going to get bigger.
p235
aVIf you cut open Stygimoloch, it is doing the same thing.
p236
aVThe dome, that little dome, is growing really fast.
p237
aVIt's inflating very fast.
p238
aVWhat's interesting is the spike on the back of the Dracorex
p239
aVwas growing very fast as well.
p240
aVThe spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing,
p241
aVwhich means they're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger.
p242
aVAnd if we look at Pachycephalosaurus,
p243
aVPachycephalosaurus has a solid dome
p244
aVand its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo just with these three dinosaurs,
p247
aVas a scientist, we can easily hypothesize
p248
aVthat it is just a growth series of the same animal.
p249
aVWhich of course means
p250
aVthat Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VOK.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VWhich of course means we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo a colleague of mine at Berkeley \u2014 he and I were looking at Triceratops.
p261
aVAnd before the year 2000 \u2014
p262
aVnow remember, Triceratops was first found in the 1800s \u2014
p263
aVbefore 2000, no one had ever seen a juvenile Triceratops.
p264
aVThere's a Triceratops in every museum in the world,
p265
aVbut no one had ever collected a juvenile.
p266
aVAnd we know why, right?
p267
aVBecause everybody wants to have a big one.
p268
aVSo everyone had a big one.
p269
aVSo we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff
p270
aVand we found a whole bunch of little ones.
p271
aVThey're everywhere, they're all over the place.
p272
aVSo we have a whole bunch of them at our museum.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd everybody says it's because I have a little museum.
p277
aVWhen you have a little museum, you have little dinosaurs.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VIf you look at the Triceratops,
p282
aVyou can see it's changing, it's shape-shifting.
p283
aVAs the juveniles are growing up, their horns actually curve backwards.
p284
aVAnd then as they get older, the horns grow forward.
p285
aVAnd that's pretty cool.
p286
aVIf you look along the edge of the frill,
p287
aVthey have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles
p288
aVand then they flatten against the frill
p289
aVpretty much like the spikes do on the Pachycephalosaurs.
p290
aVAnd then, because the juveniles are in my collection,
p291
aVI cut them open ...
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
Vand look inside.
p296
aVAnd the little one is really spongy.
p297
aVAnd the middle-size one is really spongy.
p298
aVBut what was interesting was the adult Triceratops was also spongy.
p299
aVAnd this is a skull that is two meters long.
p300
aVIt's a big skull.
p301
aa(lp302
VBut there's another dinosaur that is found in this formation
p303
aVthat looks like a Triceratops, except it's bigger,
p304
aVand it's called Torosaurus.
p305
aVAnd Torosaurus, when we cut into it, has mature bone.
p306
aVBut it's got these big holes in its shield.
p307
aVAnd everybody says,
p308
aV"A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can't possibly be the same animal
p309
aVbecause one of them's bigger than the other one."
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
V"And it has holes in its frill."
p314
aVAnd I said, "Well do we have any juvenile Torosauruses?"
p315
aVAnd they said, "Well, no, but it has holes in its frill."
p316
aa(lp317
VSo one of my graduate students, John Scannella,
p318
aVlooked through our whole collection
p319
aVand he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops
p320
aVand, of course it's open, in Torosaurus \u2014
p321
aVso he found the transitional ones between Triceratops and Torosaurus,
p322
aVwhich was pretty cool.
p323
aVSo now we know that Torosaurus is actually a grown-up Triceratops.
p324
aVNow when we name dinosaurs,
p325
aVwhen we name anything, the original name gets to stick
p326
aVand the second name is thrown out.
p327
aVSo Torosaurus is extinct.
p328
aVTriceratops, if you've heard the news, a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong.
p329
aVThey thought Torosaurus should be kept and Triceratops thrown out,
p330
aVbut that's not going to happen.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VAll right, so we can do this with a bunch of dinosaurs.
p335
aVI mean, here's Edmontosaurus
p336
aVand Anatotitan.
p337
aVAnatotitan: giant duck.
p338
aVIt's a giant duck-bill dinosaur.
p339
aVHere's another one.
p340
aVSo we look at the bone histology.
p341
aVThe bone histology tells us that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile,
p342
aVor at least a subadult,
p343
aVand the other one is an adult, and we have an ontogeny.
p344
aVAnd we get rid of Anatotitan.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo we can just keep doing this.
p347
aVAnd the last one is T. Rex.
p348
aVSo there's these two dinosaurs, T. Rex and Nanotyrannus.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VAgain, it makes you wonder.
p353
aa(lp354
V(Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VBut they had a good question.
p357
aVThey were looking at them and they said, "One's got 17 teeth,
p358
aVand the biggest one's got 12 teeth.
p359
aVAnd that doesn't make any sense at all,
p360
aVbecause we don't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older.
p361
aVSo it must be true \u2014
p362
aVthey must be different."
p363
aVSo we cut into them.
p364
aVAnd sure enough, Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone
p365
aVand the bigger one has more mature bone.
p366
aVIt looks like it could still get bigger.
p367
aVAnd at the Museum of the Rockies where we work,
p368
aVI have four T. rexes, so I can cut a whole bunch of them.
p369
aVBut I didn't have to cut any of them really,
p370
aVbecause I just lined up their jaws
p371
aVand it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth
p372
aVand the next smallest one had 13
p373
aVand the next smallest had 14.
p374
aVAnd of course, Nano has 17.
p375
aVAnd we just went out and looked at other people's collections
p376
aVand we found one that has sort of 15 teeth.
p377
aVSo again, real easy to say
p378
aVthat Tyrannosaurus ontogeny included Nanotyrannus,
p379
aVand therefore we can take out another dinosaur.
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VSo when it comes down to our end Cretaceous,
p384
aVwe have seven left.
p385
aVAnd that's a good number.
p386
aVThat's a good number to go extinct, I think.
p387
aVNow as you can imagine,
p388
aVthis is not very popular with fourth-graders.
p389
aa(lp390
V(Laughter)
p391
aa(lp392
VFourth-graders love their dinosaurs, they memorize them.
p393
aVAnd they're not happy with this.
p394
aa(lp395
V(Laughter)
p396
aa(lp397
VThank you very much.
p398
aa(lp399
V(Applause)

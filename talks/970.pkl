VWelcome to Thailand.
p5
aVNow, when I was a young man \u2014 40 years ago,
p6
aVthe country was very, very poor
p7
aVwith lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.
p8
aVWe decided to do something about it,
p9
aVbut we didn't begin with a welfare program
p10
aVor a poverty reduction program.
p11
aVBut we began with a family-planning program,
p12
aVfollowing a very successful
p13
aVmaternal child health activity,
p14
aVsets of activities.
p15
aVSo basically, no one would accept family planning
p16
aVif their children didn't survive.
p17
aVSo the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers,
p18
aVand then follow up with family planning.
p19
aVNot just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.
p20
aVNow let me take you back
p21
aVas to why we needed to do it.
p22
aa(lp23
VIn my country, that was the case in 1974.
p24
aVSeven children per family \u2014
p25
aVtremendous growth at 3.3 percent.
p26
aVThere was just no future.
p27
aVWe needed to reduce the population growth rate.
p28
aVSo we said, "Let's do it."
p29
aVThe women said, "We agree. We'll use pills,
p30
aVbut we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,"
p31
aVand we had very, very few doctors.
p32
aVWe didn't take no as an answer;
p33
aVwe took no as a question.
p34
aVWe went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women,
p35
aVand did a fantastic job
p36
aVat explaining how to use the pill.
p37
aVThat was wonderful,
p38
aVbut it covered only 20 percent of the country.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhat do we do for the other 80 percent \u2014
p41
aVleave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."
p42
aVNo, we decided to do a bit more.
p43
aVSo we went to the ordinary people that you saw.
p44
aVActually, below that yellow sign \u2014
p45
aVI wish they hadn't wiped that,
p46
aVbecause there was "Coca-Cola" there.
p47
aVWe were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.
p48
aVAnd no difference,
p49
aVthe people they chose were the people we chose.
p50
aVThey were well-known in the community,
p51
aVthey knew that customers were always right,
p52
aVand they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.
p53
aVSo they could supply pills and condoms
p54
aVthroughout the country, in every village of the country.
p55
aVSo there we are. We went to the people
p56
aVwho were seen as the cause of the problem
p57
aVto be the solution.
p58
aVWherever there were people \u2014
p59
aVand you can see boats with the women, selling things \u2014
p60
aVhere's the floating market
p61
aVselling bananas and crabs
p62
aVand also contraceptives \u2014
p63
aVwherever you find people,
p64
aVyou'll find contraceptives in Thailand.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd then we decided, why not get to religion
p67
aVbecause in the Philippines,
p68
aVthe Catholic Church was pretty strong,
p69
aVand Thai people were Buddhist.
p70
aVWe went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"
p71
aVI'm there \u2014 the one in blue, not the yellow \u2014
p72
aVholding a bowl of holy water
p73
aVfor the monk to sprinkle holy water
p74
aVon pills and condoms
p75
aVfor the sanctity of the family.
p76
aVAnd this picture was sent throughout the country.
p77
aVSo some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.
p78
aVAnd the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.
p79
aVIt's been blessed."
p80
aVThat was their perception.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd then we went to teachers.
p83
aVYou need everybody to be involved
p84
aVin trying to provide whatever it is
p85
aVthat make humanity a better place.
p86
aVSo we went to the teachers.
p87
aVOver a quarter of a million were taught about family planning
p88
aVwith a new alphabet \u2014 A, B for birth, C for condom,
p89
aVI for IUD, V for vasectomy.
p90
aVAnd then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.
p91
aVIf you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.
p92
aVLike, "Mother takes the pill every night.
p93
aVVery good, mother. Move ahead.
p94
aVUncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.
p95
aVUncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again."
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVAgain, education, class entertainment.
p98
aVAnd the kids were doing it in school too.
p99
aVWe had relay races with condoms,
p100
aVwe had children's condom-blowing championship.
p101
aVAnd before long,
p102
aVthe condom was know as the girl's best friend.
p103
aVIn Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it \u2014
p104
aVso the condom is the girl's best friend.
p105
aa(lp106
VWe introduced our first microcredit program in 1975,
p107
aVand the women who organized it said,
p108
aV"We only want to lend
p109
aVto women who practice family planning.
p110
aVIf you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.
p111
aVIf you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us."
p112
aVAnd that was run by them.
p113
aVAnd after 35/36 years,
p114
aVit's still going on.
p115
aVIt's a part of the Village Development Bank;
p116
aVit's not a real bank, but it's a fund \u2014 microcredit.
p117
aVAnd we didn't need a big organization to run it \u2014
p118
aVit was run by the villagers themselves.
p119
aVAnd you probably hardly see a Thai man there,
p120
aVit's always women, women, women, women.
p121
aVAnd then we thought we'd help America,
p122
aVbecause America's been helping everyone,
p123
aVwhether they want help or not.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVAnd this is on the Fourth of July.
p126
aVWe decided to provide vasectomy to all men,
p127
aVbut in particular, American men to the front of the queue,
p128
aVright up to the Ambassador's residence
p129
aVduring his [unclear].
p130
aVAnd the hotel gave us the ballroom for it \u2014
p131
aVvery appropriate room.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVAnd since it was near lunch time,
p134
aVthey said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.
p135
aVOf course, it must be American cola.
p136
aVYou get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.
p137
aVAnd then the food is either hamburger or hotdog."
p138
aVAnd I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVAnd here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm
p141
aVwho worked for the USAID.
p142
aVObviously, he's had his vasectomy
p143
aVbecause his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.
p144
aVIt made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.
p145
aVI said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you."
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd what happened?
p150
aVIn all this thing,
p151
aVfrom seven children to 1.5 children,
p152
aVpopulation growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.
p153
aVYou could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like \u2014
p154
aVit was exactly the same thing.
p155
aVI'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola,
p156
aVbut we're good friends.
p157
aVAnd so that's the case of everyone joining in.
p158
aVWe didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors.
p159
aVBut it's everybody's job
p160
aVwho can change attitude and behavior.
p161
aa(lp162
VThen AIDS came along and hit Thailand,
p163
aVand we had to stop doing a lot of good things
p164
aVto fight AIDS.
p165
aVBut unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.
p166
aVSo our work wasn't affected.
p167
aVSo I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."
p168
aVSo I went to the military
p169
aVand asked to borrow 300 radio stations.
p170
aVThey have more than the government,
p171
aVand they've got more guns than the government.
p172
aVSo I asked them, could they help us
p173
aVin our fight against HIV.
p174
aVAnd after I gave them statistics,
p175
aVthey said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations."
p176
aVAnd that's when we went onto the airwaves.
p177
aVAnd then we got a new prime minister soon after that.
p178
aVAnd he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"
p179
aVHe asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.
p180
aVSo I said, "Okay."
p181
aVHe became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee
p182
aVand increased the budget fifty-fold.
p183
aa(lp184
VEvery ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education \u2014
p185
aVeveryone \u2014 and we said the public, institutions,
p186
aVreligious institutions, schools \u2014
p187
aVeveryone was involved.
p188
aVAnd here, every media person
p189
aVhad to be trained for HIV.
p190
aVAnd we gave every station half a minute extra
p191
aVfor advertising to earn more money.
p192
aVSo they were happy with that.
p193
aVAnd then AIDS education in all schools,
p194
aVstarting from university.
p195
aVAnd these are high school kids teaching high school kids.
p196
aVAnd the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,
p197
aVand they were terrific.
p198
aVAnd these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV
p199
aVwere known as Mother Theresa.
p200
aVAnd then we went down one more step.
p201
aVThese are primary school kids \u2014 third, fourth grade \u2014
p202
aVgoing to every household in the village,
p203
aVevery household in the whole of Thailand,
p204
aVgiving AIDS information and a condom
p205
aVto every household,
p206
aVgiven by these young kids.
p207
aVAnd no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives,
p208
aVand this was a lifesaver.
p209
aVAnd we said, "Everyone needs to be involved."
p210
aa(lp211
VSo you have the companies also realizing
p212
aVthat sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.
p213
aVSo they all trained.
p214
aVAnd then we have this Captain Condom,
p215
aVwith his Harvard MBA,
p216
aVgoing to schools and night spots.
p217
aVAnd they loved him. You need a symbol of something.
p218
aVIn every country, every program, you need a symbol,
p219
aVand this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aVAnd then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets \u2014
p222
aVeverywhere, everywhere.
p223
aVIn taxis, you get condoms.
p224
aVAnd also, in traffic,
p225
aVthe policemen give you condoms \u2014 our "cops and rubbers" programs.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVSo, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?
p228
aVOf course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely;
p229
aVI see them standing around right now, everywhere.
p230
aVImagine if they had condoms,
p231
aVgiving out to all sorts of people.
p232
aVAnd then, new change,
p233
aVwe had hair bands, clothing
p234
aVand the condom for your mobile phone
p235
aVduring the rainy season.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd these were the condoms that we introduced.
p240
aVOne says, "Weapon of mass protection."
p241
aVWe found \u2014
p242
aVyou know \u2014 somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction,
p243
aVbut we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.
p244
aVAnd then it says here, with the American flag,
p245
aV"Don't leave home without it."
p246
aVBut I have some to give out afterward.
p247
aVBut let me warn you, these are Thai-sized,
p248
aVso be very careful.
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVAnd so you can see
p251
aVthat condoms can do so many things.
p252
aVLook at this \u2014
p253
aVI gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.
p254
aVStop global warming; use condoms.
p255
aVAnd then this is the picture I mentioned to you \u2014
p256
aVthe weapon of mass protection.
p257
aVAnd let the next Olympics save some lives.
p258
aVWhy just run around?
p259
aV(Laughter)
p260
aVAnd then finally,
p261
aVin Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,
p262
aVso instead, we say, "In rubber we trust."
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aVSo you can see that we added everything to our endeavor
p265
aVto make life better for the people.
p266
aVWe had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools,
p267
aVbecause alcohol impairs judgment.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd then what happened?
p270
aVAfter all this time, everybody joined in.
p271
aVAccording to the U.N.,
p272
aVnew cases of HIV
p273
aVdeclined by 90 percent,
p274
aVand according to the World Bank,
p275
aV7.7 million lives were saved.
p276
aVOtherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.
p277
aVSo it just showed you, you could do something about it.
p278
aV90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.
p279
aVThere was political commitment, some financial commitment,
p280
aVand everybody joined in the fight.
p281
aVSo just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.
p282
aVWe all need to help.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd then we decided to help people out of poverty,
p285
aVnow that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way \u2014
p286
aVthis time, not with government alone,
p287
aVbut in cooperation with the business community.
p288
aVBecause poor people are business people
p289
aVwho lack business skills and access to credit.
p290
aVThose are the things to be provided by the business community.
p291
aVWe're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs,
p292
aVlittle business people.
p293
aVThe only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.
p294
aVSo, that was done.
p295
aVThe money goes from the company into the village
p296
aVvia tree-planting.
p297
aVIt's not a free gift.
p298
aVThey plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund,
p299
aVwhich we call the Village Development Bank.
p300
aVEverybody joins in,
p301
aVand they feel they own the bank,
p302
aVbecause they have brought the money in.
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.
p305
aVAnd we believe if you want to help the poor,
p306
aVthose who are living in poverty,
p307
aVaccess to credit must be a human right.
p308
aVAccess to credit must be a human right.
p309
aVOtherwise they'll never get out of poverty.
p310
aVAnd then before getting a loan, you must be trained.
p311
aVHere's what we call a "barefoot MBA,"
p312
aVteaching people how to do business
p313
aVso that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.
p314
aVThese are some of the businesses:
p315
aVmushrooms, crabs, vegetables,
p316
aVtrees, fruits,
p317
aVand this is very interesting \u2014 Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;
p318
aVthis is a village sponsored by Nike.
p319
aVThey said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.
p320
aVMake these better, because we can afford them."
p321
aVAnd then we have silk, Thai silk.
p322
aVNow we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left,
p323
aVto sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.
p324
aVSo anyone sitting in and watching TV,
p325
aVget in touch with me.
p326
aVAnd then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand \u2014
p327
aV"Coffee and Condoms."
p328
aVSee, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.
p329
aVThat's the difference.
p330
aVCan you imagine, at every Starbucks
p331
aVthat you can also get condoms?
p332
aVYou can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.
p333
aa(lp334
VAnd then now, finally in education,
p335
aVwe want to change the school as being underutilized
p336
aVinto a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.
p337
aVWe call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.
p338
aVAnd it's a center, a focal point
p339
aVfor economic and social development.
p340
aVRe-do the school,
p341
aVmake it serve the community needs.
p342
aVAnd here is a bamboo building \u2014
p343
aVall of them are bamboo.
p344
aVThis is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.
p345
aVAnd I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud
p346
aVto see a bamboo geodesic dome.
p347
aVAnd we use vegetables around the school ground,
p348
aVso they raise their own vegetables.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd then, finally, I firmly believe,
p351
aVif we want the MDGs to work \u2014
p352
aVthe Millennium Development Goals \u2014
p353
aVwe need to add family planning to it.
p354
aVOf course, child mortality first and then family planning \u2014
p355
aVeveryone needs family planning service \u2014
p356
aVit's underutilized.
p357
aVSo we have now found the weapon of mass protection.
p358
aVAnd we also ask the next Olympics
p359
aVto be involved in saving lives.
p360
aVAnd then, finally, that is our network.
p361
aVAnd these are our Thai tulips.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
VThank you very much indeed.
p366
aa(lp367

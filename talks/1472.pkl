VI always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement:
p5
aVto resonate other people's feelings, thoughts, intentions, motivations,
p6
aVin the act of being with them.
p7
aVAs a scientist, I always wanted to measure that resonance,
p8
aVthat sense of the other that happens so quickly,
p9
aVin the blink of an eye.
p10
aVWe intuit other people's feelings;
p11
aVwe know the meaning of their actions even before they happen.
p12
aVWe're always in this stance
p13
aVof being the object of somebody else's subjectivity.
p14
aVWe do that all the time. We just can't shake it off.
p15
aVIt's so important that the very tools we use to understand ourselves,
p16
aVto understand the world around us,
p17
aVare shaped by that stance.
p18
aVWe are social to the core.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo my journey in autism really started
p21
aVwhen I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism.
p22
aVMost of those individuals had spent most of their lives
p23
aVin long-stay hospitals.
p24
aVThis is a long time ago.
p25
aVAnd for them, autism was devastating.
p26
aVThey had profound intellectual disabilities.
p27
aVThey didn't talk.
p28
aVBut most of all,
p29
aVthey were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them,
p30
aVfrom their environment
p31
aVand from the people.
p32
aVIn fact, at the time, if you walked into a school
p33
aVfor individuals with autism,
p34
aVyou'd hear a lot of noise,
p35
aVplenty of commotion, actions, people doing things.
p36
aVBut they're always doing things by themselves.
p37
aVSo they may be looking at a light in the ceiling,
p38
aVor they may be isolated in the corner,
p39
aVor they might be engaged in these repetitive movements,
p40
aVin self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere.
p41
aVExtremely, extremely isolated.
p42
aa(lp43
VWell, now we know that autism is this disruption,
p44
aVthe disruption of this resonance that I am telling you about.
p45
aVThese are survival skills.
p46
aVThese are survival skills that we inherited
p47
aVover many, many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.
p48
aa(lp49
VYou see, babies are born in a state of utter fragility.
p50
aVWithout the caregiver, they wouldn't survive,
p51
aVso it stands to reason that nature would endow them
p52
aVwith these mechanisms of survival.
p53
aVThey orient to the caregiver.
p54
aVFrom the first days and weeks of life,
p55
aVbabies prefer to hear human sounds,
p56
aVrather than just sounds in the environment.
p57
aVThey prefer to look at people rather than at things,
p58
aVand even as they're looking at people, they look at people's eyes,
p59
aVbecause the eye is the window to the other person's experiences,
p60
aVso much so that they even prefer to look at people
p61
aVwho are looking at them rather than people who are looking away.
p62
aVWell, they orient to the caregiver.
p63
aVThe caregiver seeks the baby.
p64
aVAnd it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography
p65
aVthat a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind \u2014
p66
aVthe social mind, the social brain \u2014 depends on.
p67
aa(lp68
VWe always think about autism
p69
aVas something that happens later on in life.
p70
aVIt doesn't; it begins with the beginning of life.
p71
aVAs babies engage with caregivers, they soon realize that, well,
p72
aVthere is something between the ears that is very important \u2014
p73
aVit's invisible, you can't see it, but it's really critical.
p74
aVAnd that thing is called attention.
p75
aVAnd they learn soon enough,
p76
aVeven before they can utter one word,
p77
aVthat they can take that attention and move somewhere
p78
aVin order to get things they want.
p79
aVThey also learn to follow other people's gazes,
p80
aVbecause whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about.
p81
aVAnd soon enough, they start to learn about the meaning of things,
p82
aVbecause when somebody is looking at something
p83
aVor somebody is pointing at something,
p84
aVthey're not just getting a directional cue.
p85
aVThey are getting the other person's meaning of that thing,
p86
aVthe attitude.
p87
aVAnd soon enough, they start building this body of meanings,
p88
aVbut meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction.
p89
aVThose are meanings that are acquired
p90
aVas part of their shared experiences with others.
p91
aa(lp92
VWell, this is a 15-month-old little girl,
p93
aVand she has autism.
p94
aVAnd I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face,
p95
aVand she's quite oblivious to me.
p96
aVImagine if I did that to you, came two inches from your face.
p97
aVYou'd do probably two things, wouldn't you?
p98
aVYou would recoil. You would call the police.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VYou would do something,
p103
aVbecause it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space
p104
aVand not get that reaction.
p105
aVWe do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly.
p106
aVThis is our body wisdom;
p107
aVit's not something mediated by our language.
p108
aVOur body just knows that.
p109
aVAnd we've known that for a long time.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd this is not something that happens to humans only.
p112
aVIt happens to some of our phyletic cousins,
p113
aVbecause if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey,
p114
aVand that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you,
p115
aVand that is considered to be a signal or threat,
p116
aVwell, you are not going to be alive for long.
p117
aVSo something that in other species are survival mechanisms,
p118
aVwithout which they wouldn't basically live,
p119
aVwe bring into the context of human beings,
p120
aVand this is what we need to simply act, socially.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her,
p123
aVand you think, maybe she can see you,
p124
aVmaybe she can hear you.
p125
aVWell, a few minutes later,
p126
aVshe goes to the corner of the room,
p127
aVand she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&M.
p128
aVSo I could not attract her attention,
p129
aVbut something \u2014 a thing \u2014 did.
p130
aVNow, most of us make a big dichotomy
p131
aVbetween the world of things and the world of people.
p132
aVNow, for this girl, that division line is not so clear,
p133
aVand the world of people is not attracting her
p134
aVas much as we would like.
p135
aVNow, remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences.
p136
aVWhat she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging,
p137
aVmoment by moment,
p138
aVas she is isolating herself further and further.
p139
aVSo we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic,
p140
aVthe brain determines who we're going to be.
p141
aVBut, in fact, the brain also becomes who we are,
p142
aVand at the same time that her behaviors are taking away
p143
aVfrom the realm of social interaction,
p144
aVthis is what's happening with her mind,
p145
aVand this is what's happening with her brain.
p146
aa(lp147
VWell, autism is the most strongly genetic condition
p148
aVof all developmental disorders.
p149
aVAnd it's a brain disorder.
p150
aVIt's a disorder that begins much prior to the time
p151
aVthat the child is born.
p152
aVWe now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.
p153
aVThere are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled
p154
aVbut there are those that are gifted.
p155
aVThere are those individuals who don't talk at all;
p156
aVthere are those individuals who talk too much.
p157
aVThere are those individuals that if you observe them in their school,
p158
aVyou see them running the periphery fence all the school day if you let them,
p159
aVto those individuals who cannot stop coming to you
p160
aVand trying to engage you repeatedly, relentlessly,
p161
aVbut often in an awkward fashion,
p162
aVwithout that immediate resonance.
p163
aa(lp164
VWell, this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time.
p165
aVWhen I started in this field,
p166
aVwe thought there were four individuals with autism per 10,000 \u2014
p167
aVa very rare condition.
p168
aVWell, now we know it's more like one in 100.
p169
aVThere are millions of individuals with autism all around us.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe societal cost of this condition is huge,
p172
aVin the US alone, maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars.
p173
aVAnd you know what?
p174
aVMost of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults
p175
aVwho are severely disabled,
p176
aVindividuals who need wraparound services \u2014
p177
aVservices that are very, very intensive.
p178
aVAnd those services can cost in excess of 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year.
p179
aVThose are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment,
p180
aVbecause now we know that autism creates itself
p181
aVas individuals diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you.
p182
aVWere we to be able to identify this condition
p183
aVat an earlier point, and intervene and treat \u2014
p184
aVI can tell you, this has been probably something that has changed my life
p185
aVin the past 10 years,
p186
aVthis notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition.
p187
aVAlso, we have a window of opportunity,
p188
aVbecause the brain is malleable for just so long,
p189
aVand that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life.
p190
aVIt's not that that window closes; it doesn't.
p191
aVBut it diminishes considerably.
p192
aVAnd yet, the median age of diagnosis in this country
p193
aVis still about five years,
p194
aVand in disadvantaged populations,
p195
aVthe populations that don't have access to clinical services,
p196
aVrural populations, minorities,
p197
aVthe age of diagnosis is later still,
p198
aVwhich is almost as if I were to tell you
p199
aVthat we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism
p200
aVwhose condition is going to be more severe.
p201
aVSo I feel that we have a bioethical imperative.
p202
aVThe science is there.
p203
aVBut no science is of relevance
p204
aVif it doesn't have an impact on the community.
p205
aVAnd we just can't afford that missed opportunity,
p206
aVbecause children with autism become adults with autism.
p207
aVAnd we feel that those things we can do
p208
aVfor these children, for those families, early on,
p209
aVwill have lifetime consequences \u2014
p210
aVfor the child, for the family, and for the community at large.
p211
aVSo this is our view of autism.
p212
aa(lp213
VThere are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism.
p214
aVIn fact, we believe there are going to be
p215
aVsomething between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism,
p216
aVand genetic anomalies, much more than just genes.
p217
aVAnd we actually have a bit of a question here,
p218
aVbecause if there are so many different causes of autism,
p219
aVhow do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome?
p220
aVBecause people like myself,
p221
aVwhen we walk into a playroom,
p222
aVwe recognize a child as having autism.
p223
aVSo how do you go from multiple causes
p224
aVto a syndrome that has some homogeneity?
p225
aVAnd the answer is what lies in between,
p226
aVwhich is development.
p227
aVAnd in fact, we are very interested in those first two years of life,
p228
aVbecause those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism.
p229
aVAutism creates itself.
p230
aVWere we to be able to intervene during those years of life,
p231
aVwe might attenuate for some, and God knows, maybe even prevent for others.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo how do we do that?
p234
aVHow do we enter that feeling of resonance,
p235
aVhow do we enter another person's being?
p236
aVI remember when I interacted with that 15-month-old,
p237
aVthe thing that came to my mind was,
p238
aV"How do you come into her world?
p239
aVIs she thinking about me? Is she thinking about others?"
p240
aVWell, it's hard to do that,
p241
aVso we had to create the technologies.
p242
aVWe had to basically step inside a body.
p243
aVWe had to see the world through her eyes.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd so in the past many years,
p246
aVwe've been building these new technologies
p247
aVthat are based on eye tracking.
p248
aVWe can see, moment by moment, what children are engaging with.
p249
aVThis is my colleague, Warren Jones,
p250
aVwith whom we've been building these methods, these studies,
p251
aVfor the past 12 years.
p252
aVAnd you see there a happy five-month-old,
p253
aVa five-month little boy who is going to watch things
p254
aVthat are brought from his world:
p255
aVhis mom, the caregiver,
p256
aVbut also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare.
p257
aVWhat we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory,
p258
aVbut in order for us to do that,
p259
aVwe had to create these very sophisticated measures,
p260
aVmeasures of how people, how little babies,
p261
aVhow newborns, engage with the world, moment by moment.
p262
aVWhat is important and what is not.
p263
aa(lp264
VWell, we created those measures,
p265
aVand here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention.
p266
aVYou're watching a video \u2014
p267
aVthose frames are separated by about a second \u2014
p268
aVthrough the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds.
p269
aVAnd we freeze one frame,
p270
aVand this is what the typical children are doing.
p271
aVIn this scan pass, in green here, are two-year-olds with autism.
p272
aVSo on that frame, the children who are typical are watching this,
p273
aVthe emotion of expression of that little boy
p274
aVas he's fighting a little bit with the little girl.
p275
aVWhat are the children with autism doing?
p276
aVThey are focusing on the revolving door,
p277
aVopening and shutting.
p278
aVWell, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here
p279
aVdoesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment.
p280
aVIt happens moment by moment in their real lives,
p281
aVand their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized
p282
aVin something other than what is happening with their typical peers.
p283
aa(lp284
VWell, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends,
p285
aVthe concept of growth charts \u2014
p286
aVyou know, when you take a child to the pediatrician,
p287
aVand you have physical height and weight.
p288
aVWell, we decided we were going to create growth charts
p289
aVof social engagement.
p290
aVWe sought children from the time they're born.
p291
aVWhat you see here on the x-axis
p292
aVis two, three, four, five, six months and nine,
p293
aVuntil about the age of 24 months.
p294
aVThis is the percent of their viewing time
p295
aVthat they're focusing on people's eyes,
p296
aVand this is their growth chart.
p297
aVThey start over here \u2014 they love people's eyes \u2014
p298
aVand it remains quite stable.
p299
aVIt sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months.
p300
aVNow, let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic.
p301
aVIt's something very different.
p302
aVIt starts way up here, but then it's a free fall.
p303
aVIt's very much like they brought into this world the reflex
p304
aVthat orients them to people, but it has no traction.
p305
aVIt's almost as if that stimulus \u2014 you \u2014
p306
aVyou're not exerting influence on what happens
p307
aVas they navigate their daily lives.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow, we thought those data were so powerful, in a way,
p310
aVthat we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life,
p311
aVbecause if you interact with a two- and a three-month-old,
p312
aVyou'd be surprised by how social those babies are.
p313
aVAnd what we see in the first six months of life
p314
aVis that those two groups can be segregated very easily.
p315
aVAnd using these kinds of measures and many others,
p316
aVwhat we found out is that our science could, in fact,
p317
aVidentify this condition early on.
p318
aVWe didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism
p319
aVto emerge in the second year of life.
p320
aVIf we measured things that are, evolutionarily, highly conserved,
p321
aVand developmentally very early-emerging \u2014
p322
aVthings that are online from the first weeks of life \u2014
p323
aVwe could push the detection of autism
p324
aVall the way to those first months,
p325
aVand that's what we are doing now.
p326
aa(lp327
VNow, we can create the very best technologies
p328
aVand the very best methods to identify the children,
p329
aVbut this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact
p330
aVon what happens in their reality in the community.
p331
aVNow we want those devices, of course,
p332
aVto be deployed by those who are in the trenches \u2014
p333
aVour colleagues, the primary care physicians, who see every child \u2014
p334
aVand we need to transform those technologies
p335
aVinto something that is going to add value to their practice,
p336
aVbecause they have to see so many children.
p337
aVAnd we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child.
p338
aVBut this would be immoral
p339
aVif we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention, for treatment.
p340
aVWe need to be able to work with the families, support the families,
p341
aVto manage those first years with them.
p342
aVWe need to be able to really go
p343
aVfrom universal screening to universal access to treatment,
p344
aVbecause those treatments are going to change
p345
aVthese children's and those families' lives.
p346
aa(lp347
VNow, when we think about what we [can] do in those first years,
p348
aVI can tell you, having been in this field for so long,
p349
aVone feels really rejuvenated.
p350
aVThere is a sense that the science that one worked on
p351
aVcan actually have an impact on realities,
p352
aVpreventing, in fact, those experiences
p353
aVthat I really started in my journey in this field.
p354
aVI thought at the time that this was an intractable condition.
p355
aVNo longer. We can do a great deal of things.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd the idea is not to cure autism.
p358
aVThat's not the idea.
p359
aVWhat we want is to make sure
p360
aVthat those individuals with autism can be free
p361
aVfrom the devastating consequences that come with it at times,
p362
aVthe profound intellectual disabilities, the lack of language,
p363
aVthe profound, profound isolation.
p364
aVWe feel that individuals with autism, in fact,
p365
aVhave a very special perspective on the world,
p366
aVand we need diversity.
p367
aVAnd they can work extremely well in some areas of strength:
p368
aVpredictable situations, situations that can be defined.
p369
aVBecause after all, they learn about the world
p370
aValmost, like, about it,
p371
aVrather than learning how to function in it.
p372
aVBut this is a strength if you're working, for example, in technology.
p373
aVAnd there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities.
p374
aVWe want them to be free to do that.
p375
aVWe want that the next generations of individuals with autism
p376
aVwill be able not only to express their strengths,
p377
aVbut to fulfill their promise.
p378
aa(lp379
VWell, thank you for listening to me.

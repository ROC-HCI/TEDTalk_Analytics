VI know a man who soars above the city every night.
p5
aVIn his dreams, he twirls and swirls
p6
aVwith his toes kissing the Earth.
p7
aVEverything has motion, he claims,
p8
aVeven a body as paralyzed as his own.
p9
aVThis man is my father.
p10
aa(lp11
VThree years ago, when I found out
p12
aVthat my father had suffered a severe stroke
p13
aVin his brain stem,
p14
aVI walked into his room in the ICU
p15
aVat the Montreal Neurological Institute
p16
aVand found him lying deathly still,
p17
aVtethered to a breathing machine.
p18
aVParalysis had closed over his body slowly,
p19
aVbeginning in his toes, then legs,
p20
aVtorso, fingers and arms.
p21
aVIt made its way up his neck,
p22
aVcutting off his ability to breathe,
p23
aVand stopped just beneath the eyes.
p24
aVHe never lost consciousness.
p25
aVRather, he watched from within
p26
aVas his body shut down,
p27
aVlimb by limb,
p28
aVmuscle by muscle.
p29
aa(lp30
VIn that ICU room, I walked up to my father's body,
p31
aa(lp32
Vand with a quivering voice and through tears,
p33
aVI began reciting the alphabet.
p34
aVA, B, C, D, E, F, G,
p35
aVH, I, J, K.
p36
aVAt K, he blinked his eyes.
p37
aVI began again.
p38
aVA, B, C, D, E, F, G,
p39
aVH, I.
p40
aVHe blinked again at the letter I,
p41
aVthen at T, then at R, and A:
p42
aVKitra.
p43
aVHe said "Kitra, my beauty, don't cry.
p44
aVThis is a blessing."
p45
aVThere was no audible voice, but my father
p46
aVcalled out my name powerfully.
p47
aVJust 72 hours after his stroke,
p48
aVhe had already embraced
p49
aVthe totality of his condition.
p50
aVDespite his extreme physical state,
p51
aVhe was completely present with me,
p52
aVguiding, nurturing,
p53
aVand being my father as much
p54
aVif not more than ever before.
p55
aa(lp56
VLocked-in syndrome
p57
aVis many people's worst nightmare.
p58
aVIn French, it's sometimes called
p59
aV"maladie de l'emmuré vivant."
p60
aVLiterally, "walled-in-alive disease."
p61
aVFor many people, perhaps most,
p62
aVparalysis is an unspeakable horror,
p63
aVbut my father's experience
p64
aVlosing every system of his body
p65
aVwas not an experience of feeling trapped,
p66
aVbut rather of turning the psyche inwards,
p67
aVdimming down the external chatter,
p68
aVfacing the recesses of his own mind,
p69
aVand in that place,
p70
aVfalling in love with life and body anew.
p71
aa(lp72
VAs a rabbi and spiritual man
p73
aVdangling between mind and body, life and death,
p74
aVthe paralysis opened up a new awareness for him.
p75
aVHe realized he no longer needed to look
p76
aVbeyond the corporeal world
p77
aVin order to find the divine.
p78
aV"Paradise is in this body.
p79
aVIt's in this world," he said.
p80
aa(lp81
VI slept by my father's side for the first four months,
p82
aVtending as much as I could
p83
aVto his every discomfort,
p84
aVunderstanding the deep  human psychological fear
p85
aVof not being able to call out for help.
p86
aVMy mother, sisters, brother and I,
p87
aVwe surrounded him in a cocoon of healing.
p88
aVWe became his mouthpiece,
p89
aVspending hours each day reciting the alphabet
p90
aVas he whispered back sermons
p91
aVand poetry with blinks of his eye.
p92
aVHis room, it became our temple of healing.
p93
aVHis bedside became a site for those
p94
aVseeking advice and spiritual counsel, and through us,
p95
aVmy father was able to speak
p96
aVand uplift,
p97
aVletter by letter,
p98
aVblink by blink.
p99
aVEverything in our world became slow and tender
p100
aVas the din, drama and death of the hospital ward
p101
aVfaded into the background.
p102
aVI want to read to you one of the first things
p103
aVthat we transcribed in the week following the stroke.
p104
aVHe composed a letter,
p105
aVaddressing his synagogue congregation,
p106
aVand ended it with the following lines:
p107
aV"When my nape exploded,
p108
aVI entered another dimension:
p109
aVinchoate, sub-planetary, protozoan.
p110
aVUniverses are opened and closed continually.
p111
aVThere are many when low,
p112
aVwho stop growing.
p113
aVLast week, I was brought so low,
p114
aVbut I felt the hand of my father around me,
p115
aVand my father brought me back."
p116
aa(lp117
VWhen we weren't his voice,
p118
aVwe were his legs and arms.
p119
aVI moved them like I know I would have wanted
p120
aVmy own arms and legs to be moved
p121
aVwere they still for all the hours of the day.
p122
aVI remember I'd hold his fingers near my face,
p123
aVbending each joint to keep it soft and limber.
p124
aVI'd ask him again and again
p125
aVto visualize the motion,
p126
aVto watch from within as the finger curled
p127
aVand extended, and to move along with it
p128
aVin his mind.
p129
aa(lp130
VThen, one day, from the corner of my eye,
p131
aVI saw his body slither like a snake,
p132
aVan involuntary spasm passing through the course
p133
aVof his limbs.
p134
aVAt first, I thought it was my own hallucination,
p135
aVhaving spent so much time tending to this one body,
p136
aVso desperate to see anything react on its own.
p137
aVBut he told me he felt tingles,
p138
aVsparks of electricity flickering on and off
p139
aVjust beneath the surface of the skin.
p140
aVThe following week, he began ever so slightly
p141
aVto show muscle resistance.
p142
aVConnections were being made.
p143
aVBody was slowly and gently reawakening,
p144
aVlimb by limb, muscle by muscle,
p145
aVtwitch by twitch.
p146
aa(lp147
VAs a documentary photographer,
p148
aVI felt the need to photograph
p149
aVeach of his first movements
p150
aVlike a mother with her newborn.
p151
aVI photographed him taking his first unaided breath,
p152
aVthe celebratory moment after he showed
p153
aVmuscle resistance for the very first time,
p154
aVthe new adapted technologies that allowed him
p155
aVto gain more and more independence.
p156
aVI photographed the care and the love
p157
aVthat surrounded him.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut my photographs only told the outside story
p160
aVof a man lying in a hospital bed
p161
aVattached to a breathing machine.
p162
aVI wasn't able to portray his story from within,
p163
aVand so I began to search for a new visual language,
p164
aVone which strived to express the ephemeral quality
p165
aVof his spiritual experience.
p166
aa(lp167
VFinally, I want to share with you
p168
aVa video from a series that I've been working on
p169
aVthat tries to express the slow, in-between existence
p170
aVthat my father has experienced.
p171
aVAs he began to regain his ability to breathe,
p172
aVI started recording his thoughts,
p173
aVand so the voice that you hear in this video
p174
aVis his voice.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Video) Ronnie Cahana: You have to believe
p177
aVyou're paralyzed
p178
aVto play the part
p179
aVof a quadriplegic.
p180
aVI don't.
p181
aVIn my mind,
p182
aVand in my dreams
p183
aVevery night
p184
aVI Chagall-man float
p185
aVover the city
p186
aVtwirl and swirl
p187
aVwith my toes kissing the floor.
p188
aVI know nothing about the statement
p189
aVof man without motion.
p190
aVEverything has motion.
p191
aVThe heart pumps.
p192
aVThe body heaves.
p193
aVThe mouth moves.
p194
aVWe never stagnate.
p195
aVLife triumphs up and down.
p196
aa(lp197
VKitra Cahana: For most of us,
p198
aVour muscles begin to twitch and move
p199
aVlong before we are conscious,
p200
aVbut my father tells me his privilege
p201
aVis living on the far periphery
p202
aVof the human experience.
p203
aVLike an astronaut who sees a perspective
p204
aVthat very few of us will ever get to share,
p205
aVhe wonders and watches as he takes
p206
aVhis first breaths
p207
aVand dreams about crawling back home.
p208
aVSo begins life at 57, he says.
p209
aVA toddler has no attitude in its being,
p210
aVbut a man insists on his world every day.
p211
aa(lp212
VFew of us will ever have to face physical limitations
p213
aVto the degree that my father has,
p214
aVbut we will all have moments of paralysis
p215
aVin our lives.
p216
aVI know I frequently confront walls
p217
aVthat feel completely unscalable,
p218
aVbut my father insists
p219
aVthat there are no dead ends.
p220
aVInstead, he invites me into his space of co-healing
p221
aVto give the very best of myself, and for him
p222
aVto give the very best of himself to me.
p223
aVParalysis was an opening for him.
p224
aVIt was an opportunity to emerge,
p225
aVto rekindle life force,
p226
aVto sit still long enough with himself
p227
aVso as to fall in love with the full continuum
p228
aVof creation.
p229
aa(lp230
VToday, my father is no longer locked in.
p231
aVHe moves his neck with ease,
p232
aVhas had his feeding peg removed,
p233
aVbreathes with his own lungs,
p234
aVspeaks slowly with his own quiet voice,
p235
aVand works every day
p236
aVto gain more movement in his paralyzed body.
p237
aVBut the work will never be finished.
p238
aVAs he says, "I'm living in a broken world,
p239
aVand there is holy work to do."
p240
aa(lp241
VThank you.

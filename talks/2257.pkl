VWhen I was growing up, I really  liked playing hide-and-seek a lot.
p5
aVOne time, though, I thought climbing a tree would lead to a great hiding spot,
p6
aVbut I fell and broke my arm.
p7
aVI actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso.
p8
aVIt was taken off six weeks later, but even then, I couldn't extend my elbow,
p9
aVand I had to do physical therapy to flex and extend it,
p10
aV100 times per day, seven days per week.
p11
aVI barely did it, because I found it boring and painful,
p12
aVand as a result, it took me another six weeks to get better.
p13
aa(lp14
VMany years later, my mom developed frozen shoulder,
p15
aVwhich leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder.
p16
aVThe person I believed for half of my life to have superpowers
p17
aVsuddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food.
p18
aVShe went each week to physical therapy, but just like me,
p19
aVshe barely followed the home treatment,
p20
aVand it took her over five months to feel better.
p21
aa(lp22
VBoth my mom and I required physical therapy,
p23
aVa process of doing a suite of repetitive exercises
p24
aVin order to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury.
p25
aVAt first, a physical therapist works with patients,
p26
aVbut then it's up to the patients to do their exercises at home.
p27
aVBut patients find physical therapy boring, frustrating, confusing
p28
aVand lengthy before seeing results.
p29
aVSadly, patient noncompliance can be as high as 70 percent.
p30
aVThis means the majority of patients don't do their exercises
p31
aVand therefore take a lot longer to get better.
p32
aVAll physical therapists agree that special exercises
p33
aVreduce the time needed for recovery,
p34
aVbut patients lack the motivation to do them.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo together with three friends, all of us software geeks,
p37
aVwe asked ourselves,
p38
aVwouldn't it be interesting if patients could play their way to recovery?
p39
aVWe started building MIRA, A P.C. software platform
p40
aVthat uses this Kinect device, a motion capture camera,
p41
aVto transform traditional exercises into video games.
p42
aa(lp43
VMy physical therapist has already set up a schedule for my particular therapy.
p44
aVLet's see how this looks.
p45
aVThe first game asks me to fly a bee up and down
p46
aVto gather pollen to deposit in beehives,
p47
aVall while avoiding the other bugs.
p48
aVI control the bee by doing elbow extension and flexion,
p49
aVjust like when I was seven years old after the cast was taken off.
p50
aa(lp51
VWhen designing a game, we speak to physical therapists at first
p52
aVto understand what movement patients need to do.
p53
aVWe then make that a video game
p54
aVto give patients simple, motivating objectives to follow.
p55
aVBut the software is very customizable,
p56
aVand physical therapists can also create their own exercises.
p57
aVUsing the software, my physical therapist
p58
aVrecorded herself performing a shoulder abduction,
p59
aVwhich is one of the movements my mom had to do
p60
aVwhen she had frozen shoulder.
p61
aVI can follow my therapist's example on the left side of the screen,
p62
aVwhile on the right, I see myself doing the recommended movement.
p63
aVI feel more engaged and confident,
p64
aVas I'm exercising alongside my therapist
p65
aVwith the exercises my therapist thinks are best for me.
p66
aVThis basically extends the application for physical therapists
p67
aVto create whatever exercises they think are best.
p68
aa(lp69
VThis is an auction house game for preventing falls,
p70
aVdesigned to strengthen muscles and improve balance.
p71
aVAs a patient, I need to do sit and stand movements,
p72
aVand when I stand up,
p73
aVI bid for the items I want to buy.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VIn two days, my grandmother will be 82 years old,
p77
aVand there's a 50 percent chance for people over 80
p78
aVto fall at least once per year,
p79
aVwhich could lead to a broken hip or even worse.
p80
aVPoor muscle tone and impaired balance are the number one cause of falls,
p81
aVso reversing these problems through targeted exercise
p82
aVwill help keep older people like my grandmother
p83
aVsafer and independent for longer.
p84
aVWhen my schedule ends, MIRA briefly shows me
p85
aVhow I progressed throughout my session.
p86
aa(lp87
VI have just shown you three different games
p88
aVfor kids, adults and seniors.
p89
aVThese can be used with orthopedic or neurologic patients,
p90
aVbut we'll soon have options for children with autism,
p91
aVmental health or speech therapy.
p92
aVMy physical therapist can go back to my profile
p93
aVand see the data gathered during my sessions.
p94
aVShe can see how much I moved, how many points I scored,
p95
aVwith what speed I moved my joints,
p96
aVand so on.
p97
aVMy physical therapist can use all of this to adapt my treatment.
p98
aa(lp99
VI'm so pleased this version is now in use
p100
aVin over 10 clinics across Europe and the U.S.,
p101
aVand we're working on the home version.
p102
aVWe want to enable physical therapists to prescribe this digital treatment
p103
aVand help patients play their way to recovery at home.
p104
aVIf my mom or I had a tool like this when we needed physical therapy,
p105
aVthen we would have been more successful following the treatment,
p106
aVand perhaps gotten better a lot sooner.
p107
aa(lp108
VThank you.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
VTom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell me what hardware is this
p113
aVthat they're rapidly putting away?
p114
aVWhat is that made of, and how much does it cost?
p115
aa(lp116
VCosmin Milhau: So it's a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo,
p117
aVbut you just need a computer and a Kinect, which is 120 dollars.
p118
aa(lp119
VTR: Right, and the Kinect is the thing that people use for their Xboxes
p120
aVto do 3D games, right?
p121
aa(lp122
VCM: Exactly, but you don't need the Xbox, you only need a camera.
p123
aa(lp124
VTR: Right, so this is less than a $1,000 solution.
p125
aa(lp126
VCM: Definitely, 400 dollars, you can definitely use it.
p127
aa(lp128
VTR: So right now, you're doing clinical trials in clinics.
p129
aa(lp130
VCM: Yes.
p131
aa(lp132
VTR: And then the hope is to get it so it's a home version
p133
aVand I can do my exercise remotely,
p134
aVand the therapist at the clinic can see how I'm doing and stuff like that.
p135
aa(lp136
VCM: Exactly.
p137
aa(lp138
VTR: Cool. Thanks so much. CM: Thank you.

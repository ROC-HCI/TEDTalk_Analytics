VI'm going to talk about two stories today.
p5
aVOne is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand
p6
aVand use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions
p7
aVin the transportation sector.
p8
aVAnd the other is that there is an incredible opportunity
p9
aVif we choose the right wireless technologies;
p10
aVhow we can generate a new engine for economic growth
p11
aVand dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.
p12
aa(lp13
VI'm really scared.
p14
aVWe need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent
p15
aVin order to avert catastrophic effects.
p16
aVAnd I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.
p17
aVWhat are catastrophic effects? A three degree centigrade climate change rise
p18
aVthat will result in 50 percent species extinction.
p19
aVIt's not a movie. This is real life.
p20
aVAnd I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars
p21
aV\u2014 which I know something about \u2014
p22
aVthe press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking,
p23
aV"Let's use fuel-efficient cars."
p24
aVIf we started today, 10 years from now, at the end of this window of opportunity,
p25
aVthose fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent.
p26
aVThat is not enough.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut now I'll talk about some more pleasant things.
p29
aVHere are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes.
p30
aVSo, Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago,
p31
aVbut it's an example of something called car sharing.
p32
aVWhat Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas
p33
aVfor members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.
p34
aVHow does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar?
p35
aVIt means that I pay only for what I need.
p36
aVAll those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it.
p37
aVIt means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.
p38
aVSo, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day.
p39
aVI can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients.
p40
aVI can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd the other remarkable thing is it's, I think, the highest status of car ownership.
p43
aVNot only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world
p44
aVthat I can have at my beck and call,
p45
aVbut heaven forbid I would ever maintain
p46
aVor deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.
p47
aVIt's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have.
p48
aVI get all the good stuff and none of the bad.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo, what is the social result of this?
p51
aVThe social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 members
p52
aVdriving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.
p53
aVInstead of driving 12,000 miles a year, which is what the average city dweller does,
p54
aVthey drive 500 miles a year. Are they happy?
p55
aVThe company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it, or greater.
p56
aVPeople adore the company. And it's better,
p57
aVyou know? They like it.
p58
aVSo, how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles?
p59
aVIt's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.
p60
aVIf I'm going to go buy some ice cream,
p61
aVdo I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream? Or maybe I'll do without.
p62
aVMaybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand."
p63
aVSo, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.
p66
aVIt required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds
p67
aVto reserve a car, go get it, drive it.
p68
aVAnd for me, as a service provider,
p69
aVI would never be able to provide you a car for an hour
p70
aVif the transaction cost was anything.
p71
aVSo, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo, here's another example. This company is GoLoco \u2014
p74
aVI'm launching it in about three weeks \u2014
p75
aVand I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing.
p76
aVThis will apply to people across all of America.
p77
aVToday, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles,
p78
aVyet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.
p79
aVAnd I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems
p80
aVto completely change how people feel about ridesharing
p81
aVand make that trip much more efficient.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd so when I think about the future,
p84
aVpeople will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone
p85
aVis this incredibly great social event out of their day.
p86
aVYou know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters.
p87
aVHow fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car?
p88
aVHow did you go food shopping? You went with your neighbor, what a great social time.
p89
aVYou know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel,
p90
aVand it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility.
p91
aVWhere can I go today and who can I do it with?
p92
aVThose are the types of things that you will look at and feel.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd the social benefits:
p95
aVthe rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent;
p96
aVI think we can get that down to 50 percent.
p97
aVThe demand for parking, of course, is down, congestion and the CO2 emissions.
p98
aVOne last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies.
p99
aVAnd it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this.
p100
aVThe average American spends 19 percent of their income on their car,
p101
aVand there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost, yet they have no outlet today.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London.
p104
aVIt's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads.
p105
aVIn London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on,
p106
aVthere was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight,
p107
aVand that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing.
p108
aVAnd again, do people like the outcome?
p109
aVKen Livingstone was reelected.
p110
aVSo again, we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness
p111
aVto reduce their driving behavior.
p112
aVWe've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.
p113
aVThere's a huge slack in that system;
p114
aVwith the right pricing we can undo that.
p115
aa(lp116
VCongestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world
p117
aVand is, again, wirelessly enabled.
p118
aVYou weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London
p119
aVand open and shut those gates.
p120
aVAnd what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial
p121
aVfor something called road pricing.
p122
aVAnd road pricing is where we're all going to have to go,
p123
aVbecause today we pay for our maintenance
p124
aVand wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.
p125
aVAnd as we get our cars more fuel-efficient,
p126
aVthat's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes,
p127
aVso we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.
p128
aVWhatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies
p129
aVwill be happening with road pricing.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhy do we travel too much?
p132
aVCar travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.
p133
aVWe need to put this better market feedback.
p134
aVAnd if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive,
p135
aVwhat mode of travel, where to live and work.
p136
aVAnd wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, I want to move now to the second part of my story,
p139
aVwhich is: when are we going to start doing
p140
aVthis congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.
p141
aVWhen are we going to do it? Are we going to wait
p142
aV10 to 15 years for this to happen
p143
aVor are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?
p144
aVBecause I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd what kind of wireless technology are we going to use?
p147
aVThis is my big vision.
p148
aVThere is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide,
p149
aVrespond to emergencies, get traffic moving,
p150
aVprovide a new engine for economic growth
p151
aVand dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in every sector.
p152
aVAnd this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment?
p153
aVYou guys are going to be the handsome young guy
p154
aVand I'm going to be the wise businessman.
p155
aV"I want to say one word to you, just one word."
p156
aV"Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am."
p157
aV"Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks."
p158
aV(Laughter)
p159
aVThese are also called mesh networks.
p160
aVAnd in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network,
p161
aVand I think you might have heard a little bit about it before.
p162
aa(lp163
VI'm going to give you some examples.
p164
aVYou'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay.
p165
aVThese laptops, when a child opens them up,
p166
aVthey communicate with every single child in the classroom,
p167
aVwithin that school, within that village.
p168
aVAnd what is the cost of that communication system?
p169
aVZero dollars a month.
p170
aVHere's another example: in New Orleans,
p171
aVvideo cameras were mesh-enabled
p172
aVso that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter.
p173
aVWhen the hurricane happened,
p174
aVthe only communication system standing was the mesh network.
p175
aVVolunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices,
p176
aVand for the next 12 months,
p177
aVmesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnother example is in Portsmouth, U.K.
p180
aVThey mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.
p181
aVYou can look at the terminal
p182
aVand be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street
p183
aVand when it's coming, and you can buy your tickets in real time.
p184
aVAgain, all mesh-enabled. Monthly communication cost: zero.
p185
aVSo, the beauty of mesh networks:
p186
aVyou can have these very low-cost devices.
p187
aVZero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable;
p188
aVyou can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina,
p189
aVyou can keep subtracting them \u2014 as long as there's some, we can still communicate.
p190
aVThey're resilient; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design.
p191
aa(lp192
VWhat are the incredible weaknesses?
p193
aVThere isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen \u2014
p194
aVor in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks \u2014
p195
aVbecause there's zero ongoing communications cost.
p196
aVSo, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks,
p197
aVand networks are interesting only as they are big.
p198
aa(lp199
VHow do we create a big network?
p200
aVAre you guys ready again \u2014 "The Graduate"?
p201
aVThis time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman.
p202
aVThese are the next two lines in the movie.
p203
aV"Where did you do it?" "In his car."
p204
aVSo you know, when you stick this idea ... (Laughter)
p205
aVwhere would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinking
p206
aVis imagine if we put a mesh-network device
p207
aVin every single car across America.
p208
aVWe could have a coast-to-coast, free wireless communication system.
p209
aVI guess I just want you to think about that.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd why is this going to happen? Because we're going to do congestion pricing,
p212
aVwe are going to do road tolls,
p213
aVgas taxes are going to become road pricing.
p214
aVThese things are going to happen.
p215
aVWhat's the wireless technology we're going to use?
p216
aVMaybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it?
p217
aVMaybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen.
p218
aVWe should pull it forward.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo, I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system,
p221
aVand require that this network be accessible to everyone, with open standards.
p222
aVRight now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices \u2014
p223
aVI guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane \u2014
p224
aVthat are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.
p225
aVWhat is the point?
p226
aVWe're transferring just a few little data bits
p227
aVwhen we're doing road controlling, road pricing.
p228
aVWe have this incredible excess capacity.
p229
aVSo, we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast,
p230
aVwe can have resilient nationwide communication systems,
p231
aVwe have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.
p232
aVImagine what happens when the cost of getting information
p233
aVfrom anywhere to anywhere is close to zero.
p234
aVWhat you can do with that tool: we can create an economic engine.
p235
aVInformation should be free, and access to information should be free,
p236
aVand we should be charging people for carbon.
p237
aa(lp238
VI think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act,
p239
aVand I think this is as important and world changing
p240
aVto our economy as electrification.
p241
aVAnd if I had my druthers,
p242
aVwe would have an open-source version in addition to open standards.
p243
aVAnd this open-source version means that
p244
aVit could be \u2014 if we did a brilliant job of it \u2014
p245
aVit could be used around the world very quickly.
p246
aVSo, going back to one of my earlier thoughts.
p247
aVImagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.
p248
aVWhen I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize
p249
aV\u2014 his fabulous networks \u2014
p250
aVimagine if there was an open-source
p251
aVmesh communications device that can be put into those networks,
p252
aVto make all that happen.
p253
aVAnd we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that
p254
aVthis little slice of things is going to be for free.
p255
aVWe could make billions of dollars on top of it,
p256
aVbut this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo, let's take control of this nightmare:
p259
aVimplement a gas tax immediately;
p260
aVtransition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh;
p261
aVrequire that the mesh be open to all, with open standards;
p262
aVand, of course, use mesh networks.
p263
aVThank you. (Applause)

VWhat I'm going to try to do is explain to you
p5
aVquickly how to predict,
p6
aVand illustrate it with some predictions
p7
aVabout what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years.
p8
aa(lp9
VIn order to predict effectively,
p10
aVwe need to use science.
p11
aVAnd the reason that we need to use science
p12
aVis because then we can reproduce what we're doing;
p13
aVit's not just wisdom or guesswork.
p14
aVAnd if we can predict,
p15
aVthen we can engineer the future.
p16
aVSo if you are concerned to influence energy policy,
p17
aVor you are concerned to influence national security policy,
p18
aVor health policy, or education,
p19
aVscience \u2014 and a particular branch of science \u2014 is a way to do it,
p20
aVnot the way we've been doing it,
p21
aVwhich is seat-of-the-pants wisdom.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow before I get into how to do it
p24
aVlet me give you a little truth in advertising,
p25
aVbecause I'm not engaged in the business of magic.
p26
aVThere are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict,
p27
aVand there are some that it can't.
p28
aVIt can predict complex negotiations
p29
aVor situations involving coercion \u2014
p30
aVthat is in essence everything that has to do with politics,
p31
aVmuch of what has to do with business,
p32
aVbut sorry, if you're looking to speculate in the stock market,
p33
aVI don't predict stock markets \u2014 OK,
p34
aVit's not going up any time really soon.
p35
aVBut I'm not engaged in doing that.
p36
aVI'm not engaged in predicting random number generators.
p37
aVI actually get phone calls from people
p38
aVwho want to know what lottery numbers are going to win.
p39
aVI don't have a clue.
p40
aa(lp41
VI engage in the use of game theory, game theory is a branch of mathematics
p42
aVand that means, sorry, that even in the study of politics,
p43
aVmath has come into the picture.
p44
aVWe can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics,
p45
aVwe need to look at this in a rigorous way.
p46
aVNow, what is game theory about?
p47
aVIt assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them.
p48
aVThat doesn't seem terribly shocking \u2014
p49
aValthough it's controversial for a lot of people \u2014
p50
aVthat we are self-interested.
p51
aVIn order to look out for what's best for them
p52
aVor what they think is best for them,
p53
aVpeople have values \u2014 they identify what they want, and what they don't want.
p54
aVAnd they have beliefs about what other people want,
p55
aVand what other people don't want, how much power other people have,
p56
aVhow much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want.
p57
aVAnd they face limitations, constraints,
p58
aVthey may be weak, they may be located in the wrong part of the world,
p59
aVthey may be Einstein, stuck away farming
p60
aVsomeplace in a rural village in India not being noticed,
p61
aVas was the case for Ramanujan for a long time,
p62
aVa great mathematician but nobody noticed.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow who is rational?
p65
aVA lot of people are worried about what is rationality about?
p66
aVYou know, what if people are rational?
p67
aVMother Theresa, she was rational.
p68
aVTerrorists, they're rational.
p69
aVPretty much everybody is rational.
p70
aVI think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of \u2014
p71
aVtwo-year-olds, they are not rational,
p72
aVthey have very fickle preferences,
p73
aVthey switch what they think all the time,
p74
aVand schizophrenics are probably not rational,
p75
aVbut pretty much everybody else is rational.
p76
aVThat is, they are just trying to do
p77
aVwhat they think is in their own best interest.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow in order to work out what people are going to do
p80
aVto pursue their interests,
p81
aVwe have to think about who has influence in the world.
p82
aVIf you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior,
p83
aVwith regard to producing pollutants,
p84
aVone approach, the common approach,
p85
aVis to exhort them to be better,
p86
aVto explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet.
p87
aVAnd many of you may have noticed that doesn't have
p88
aVas big an effect, as perhaps you would like it to have.
p89
aVBut if you show them that it's in their interest,
p90
aVthen they're responsive.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo, we have to work out who influences problems.
p93
aVIf we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States
p94
aVwe would like to think, may have some influence \u2014
p95
aVcertainly the president in Iran has some influence \u2014
p96
aVbut we make a mistake if we just pay attention
p97
aVto the person at the top of the power ladder
p98
aVbecause that person doesn't know much about Iran,
p99
aVor about energy policy,
p100
aVor about health care,
p101
aVor about any particular policy.
p102
aVThat person surrounds himself or herself with advisers.
p103
aVIf we're talking about national security problems,
p104
aVmaybe it's the Secretary of State,
p105
aVmaybe it's the Secretary of Defense,
p106
aVthe Director of National Intelligence,
p107
aVmaybe the ambassador to the United Nations, or somebody else
p108
aVwho they think is going to know more about the particular problem.
p109
aVBut let's face it, the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran.
p110
aVThe secretary of defense doesn't know much about Iran.
p111
aVEach of those people in turn
p112
aVhas advisers who advise them,
p113
aVso they can advise the president.
p114
aVThere are lots of people shaping decisions
p115
aVand so if we want to predict correctly
p116
aVwe have to pay attention to everybody
p117
aVwho is trying to shape the outcome,
p118
aVnot just the people at the pinnacle
p119
aVof the decision-making pyramid.
p120
aa(lp121
VUnfortunately, a lot of times we don't do that.
p122
aVThere's a good reason that we don't do that,
p123
aVand there's a good reason that using game theory and computers,
p124
aVwe can overcome the limitation
p125
aVof just looking at a few people.
p126
aVImagine a problem with just five decision-makers.
p127
aVImagine for example
p128
aVthat Sally over here,
p129
aVwants to know what Harry, and Jane,
p130
aVand George and Frank are thinking,
p131
aVand sends messages to those people.
p132
aVSally's giving her opinion to them,
p133
aVand they're giving their opinion to Sally.
p134
aVBut Sally also wants to know
p135
aVwhat Harry is saying to these three,
p136
aVand what they're saying to Harry.
p137
aVAnd Harry wants to know
p138
aVwhat each of those people are saying to each other, and so on,
p139
aVand Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying.
p140
aVThat's a complicated problem; that's a lot to know.
p141
aVWith five decision-makers
p142
aVthere are a lot of linkages \u2014
p143
aV120, as a matter of fact,
p144
aVif you remember your factorials.
p145
aVFive factorial is 120.
p146
aVNow you may be surprised to know
p147
aVthat smart people can keep 120 things straight
p148
aVin their head.
p149
aVSuppose we double the number of influencers
p150
aVfrom five to 10.
p151
aVDoes that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information
p152
aVwe need to know, from 120 to 240?
p153
aVNo. How about 10 times?
p154
aVTo 1,200? No.
p155
aVWe've increased it to 3.6 million.
p156
aVNobody can keep that straight in their head.
p157
aVBut computers,
p158
aVthey can. They don't need coffee breaks,
p159
aVthey don't need vacations,
p160
aVthey don't need to go to sleep at night,
p161
aVthey don't ask for raises either.
p162
aVThey can keep this information straight
p163
aVand that means that we can process the information.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo I'm going to talk to you about how to process it,
p166
aVand I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran,
p167
aVand you're going to be wondering,
p168
aV"Why should we listen to this guy?
p169
aVWhy should we believe what he's saying?"
p170
aVSo I'm going to show you a factoid.
p171
aVThis is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency
p172
aVof the percentage of time
p173
aVthat the model I'm talking about
p174
aVis right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known,
p175
aVwhen the experts who provided the data inputs
p176
aVgot it wrong.
p177
aVThat's not my claim, that's a CIA claim \u2014 you can read it,
p178
aVit was declassified a while ago. You can read it in a volume edited by
p179
aVH. Bradford Westerfield, Yale University Press.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo, what do we need to know
p182
aVin order to predict?
p183
aVYou may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much.
p184
aVWe do need to know who has a stake
p185
aVin trying to shape the outcome of a decision.
p186
aVWe need to know what they say they want,
p187
aVnot what they want in their heart of hearts,
p188
aVnot what they think they can get,
p189
aVbut what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position,
p190
aVand we can work backwards from that
p191
aVto draw inferences about important features of their decision-making.
p192
aVWe need to know how focused they are
p193
aVon the problem at hand.
p194
aVThat is, how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up,
p195
aVand attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate \u2014
p196
aVhow big a deal is it to them?
p197
aVAnd how much clout could they bring to bear
p198
aVif they chose to engage on the issue?
p199
aa(lp200
VIf we know those things
p201
aVwe can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody
p202
aVcares about two things on any decision.
p203
aVThey care about the outcome. They'd like an outcome as close to
p204
aVwhat they are interested in as possible.
p205
aVThey're careerists, they also care about getting credit \u2014
p206
aVthere's ego involvement,
p207
aVthey want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome,
p208
aVor as important, if it's their druthers, to block an outcome.
p209
aVAnd so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.
p210
aVDifferent people trade off
p211
aVbetween standing by their outcome,
p212
aVfaithfully holding to it, going down in a blaze of glory,
p213
aVor giving it up, putting their finger in the wind,
p214
aVand doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position.
p215
aVMost people fall in between, and if we can work out where they fall
p216
aVwe can work out how to negotiate with them
p217
aVto change their behavior.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo with just that little bit of input
p220
aVwe can work out what the choices are that people have,
p221
aVwhat the chances are that they're willing to take,
p222
aVwhat they're after, what they value, what they want,
p223
aVand what they believe about other people.
p224
aVYou might notice what we don't need to know:
p225
aVthere's no history in here.
p226
aVHow they got to where they are
p227
aVmay be important in shaping the input information,
p228
aVbut once we know where they are
p229
aVwe're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future.
p230
aVHow they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting.
p231
aVI remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo where are we going to get this information?
p234
aVWe can get this information
p235
aVfrom the Internet, from The Economist,
p236
aVThe Financial Times, The New York Times,
p237
aVU.S. News and World Report, lots of sources like that,
p238
aVor we can get it from asking experts
p239
aVwho spend their lives studying places and problems,
p240
aVbecause those experts know this information.
p241
aVIf they don't know, who are the people trying to influence the decision,
p242
aVhow much clout do they have,
p243
aVhow much they care about this issue, and what do they say they want,
p244
aVare they experts? That's what it means to be an expert,
p245
aVthat's the basic stuff an expert needs to know.
p246
aa(lp247
VAlright, lets turn to Iran.
p248
aVLet me make three important predictions \u2014
p249
aVyou can check this out, time will tell.
p250
aVWhat is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program?
p251
aVHow secure is the theocratic regime in Iran?
p252
aVWhat's its future?
p253
aVAnd everybody's best friend,
p254
aVAhmadinejad. How are things going for him?
p255
aVHow are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two?
p256
aVYou take a look at this, this is not based on statistics.
p257
aVI want to be very clear here. I'm not projecting some past data into the future.
p258
aVI've taken inputs on positions and so forth,
p259
aVrun it through a computer model
p260
aVthat had simulated the dynamics of interaction,
p261
aVand these are the simulated dynamics,
p262
aVthe predictions about the path of policy.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo you can see here on the vertical axis,
p265
aVI haven't shown it all the way down to zero,
p266
aVthere are lots of other options, but here I'm just showing you the prediction,
p267
aVso I've narrowed the scale.
p268
aVUp at the top of the axis, "Build the Bomb."
p269
aVAt 130, we start somewhere above 130,
p270
aVbetween building a bomb, and making enough weapons-grade fuel
p271
aVso that you could build a bomb.
p272
aVThat's where, according to my analyses,
p273
aVthe Iranians were at the beginning of this year.
p274
aVAnd then the model makes predictions down the road.
p275
aVAt 115 they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel
p276
aVto show that they know how, but they wouldn't build a weapon:
p277
aVthey would build a research quantity.
p278
aVIt would achieve some national pride,
p279
aVbut not go ahead and build a weapon.
p280
aVAnd down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy,
p281
aVwhich is what they say is their objective.
p282
aa(lp283
VThe yellow line shows us the most likely path.
p284
aVThe yellow line includes an analysis
p285
aVof 87 decision makers in Iran,
p286
aVand a vast number of outside influencers
p287
aVtrying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior,
p288
aVvarious players in the United States, and Egypt,
p289
aVand Saudi Arabia, and Russia, European Union,
p290
aVJapan, so on and so forth.
p291
aVThe white line reproduces the analysis
p292
aVif the international environment
p293
aVjust left Iran to make its own internal decisions,
p294
aVunder its own domestic political pressures.
p295
aVThat's not going to be happening,
p296
aVbut you can see that the line comes down faster
p297
aVif they're not put under international pressure,
p298
aVif they're allowed to pursue their own devices.
p299
aa(lp300
VBut in any event, by the end of this year,
p301
aVbeginning of next year, we get to a stable equilibrium outcome.
p302
aVAnd that equilibrium is not what the United States would like,
p303
aVbut it's probably an equilibrium that the United States can live with,
p304
aVand that a lot of others can live with.
p305
aVAnd that is that Iran will achieve that nationalist pride
p306
aVby making enough weapons-grade fuel, through research,
p307
aVso that they could show that they know how to make weapons-grade fuel,
p308
aVbut not enough to actually build a bomb.
p309
aVHow is this happening?
p310
aVOver here you can see this is the distribution
p311
aVof power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today,
p312
aVthis is what that power block is predicted to be like
p313
aVby the late parts of 2010, early parts of 2011.
p314
aVJust about nobody supports research on weapons-grade fuel today,
p315
aVbut by 2011 that gets to be a big block,
p316
aVand you put these two together, that's the controlling influence in Iran.
p317
aa(lp318
VOut here today, there are a bunch of people \u2014
p319
aVAhmadinejad for example \u2014
p320
aVwho would like not only to build a bomb,
p321
aVbut test a bomb.
p322
aVThat power disappears completely;
p323
aVnobody supports that by 2011.
p324
aVThese guys are all shrinking,
p325
aVthe power is all drifting out here,
p326
aVso the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel.
p327
aa(lp328
VWho are the winners and who are the losers in Iran?
p329
aVTake a look at these guys, they're growing in power,
p330
aVand by the way, this was done a while ago
p331
aVbefore the current economic crisis,
p332
aVand that's probably going to get steeper.
p333
aVThese folks are the moneyed interests in Iran,
p334
aVthe bankers, the oil people, the bazaaries.
p335
aVThey are growing in political clout,
p336
aVas the mullahs are isolating themselves \u2014
p337
aVwith the exception of one group of mullahs,
p338
aVwho are not well known to Americans.
p339
aVThat's this line here, growing in power,
p340
aVthese are what the Iranians call the quietists.
p341
aVThese are the Ayatollahs, mostly based in Qom,
p342
aVwho have great clout in the religious community,
p343
aVhave been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder,
p344
aVbecause they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction,
p345
aVa direction contrary
p346
aVto what Khomeini had in mind.
p347
aVHere is Mr. Ahmadinejad.
p348
aVTwo things to notice: he's getting weaker,
p349
aVand while he gets a lot of attention in the United States,
p350
aVhe is not a major player in Iran.
p351
aVHe is on the way down.
p352
aa(lp353
VOK, so I'd like you to take a little away from this.
p354
aVEverything is not predictable: the stock market
p355
aVis, at least for me, not predictable,
p356
aVbut most complicated negotiations are predictable.
p357
aVAgain, whether we're talking health policy, education,
p358
aVenvironment, energy,
p359
aVlitigation, mergers,
p360
aVall of these are complicated problems
p361
aVthat are predictable,
p362
aVthat this sort of technology can be applied to.
p363
aVAnd the reason that being able to predict those things is important,
p364
aVis not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it,
p365
aVbut because if you can predict what people will do,
p366
aVyou can engineer what they will do.
p367
aVAnd if you engineer what they do you can change the world,
p368
aVyou can get a better result.
p369
aVI would like to leave you with one thought, which is
p370
aVfor me, the dominant theme of this gathering,
p371
aVand is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world.
p372
aVWhen people say to you,
p373
aV"That's impossible,"
p374
aVyou say back to them,
p375
aV"When you say 'That's impossible,'
p376
aVyou're confused with,
p377
aV'I don't know how to do it.'"
p378
aVThank you.
p379
aa(lp380
V(Applause)
p381
aa(lp382
VChris Anderson: One question for you.
p383
aVThat was fascinating.
p384
aVI love that you put it out there.
p385
aVI got very nervous halfway through the talk though,
p386
aVjust panicking whether you'd included in your model, the possibility that
p387
aVputting this prediction out there might change the result.
p388
aVWe've got 800 people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks.
p389
aa(lp390
VBruce Bueno de Mesquita: I've thought about that,
p391
aVand since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community,
p392
aVthey've also pondered that.
p393
aVIt would be a good thing if
p394
aVpeople paid more attention, took seriously,
p395
aVand engaged in the same sorts of calculations,
p396
aVbecause it would change things. But it would change things in two beneficial ways.
p397
aVIt would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement,
p398
aVand so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time.
p399
aVAnd, it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with,
p400
aVwithout having to manipulate them so much \u2014
p401
aVwhich is basically what I do, I manipulate them.
p402
aVSo it would be a good thing.
p403
aa(lp404
VCA: So you're kind of trying to say, "People of Iran, this is your destiny, lets go there."
p405
aa(lp406
VBBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want,
p407
aVand we could get there a lot sooner,
p408
aVand you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions,
p409
aVand we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end,
p410
aVand the world would be a better place.
p411
aa(lp412
VCA: Here's hoping they hear it that way. Thank you very much Bruce.
p413
aa(lp414
VBBM: Thank you.

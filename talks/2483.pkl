VPeriods.
p5
aVBlood.
p6
aVMenstruation.
p7
aVGross.
p8
aVSecret.
p9
aVHidden.
p10
aVWhy?
p11
aa(lp12
VA natural biological process
p13
aVthat every girl and woman goes through every month
p14
aVfor about half of her life.
p15
aVA phenomenon that is so significant
p16
aVthat the survival and propagation of our species depends on it.
p17
aVYet we consider it a taboo.
p18
aVWe feel awkward and shameful talking about it.
p19
aa(lp20
VWhen I got my first periods,
p21
aVI was told to keep it a secret from others \u2014
p22
aVeven from my father and brother.
p23
aVLater when this chapter appeared in our textbooks,
p24
aVour biology teacher skipped the subject.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VYou know what I learned from it?
p29
aVI learned that it is really shameful to talk about it.
p30
aVI learned to be ashamed of my body.
p31
aVI learned to stay unaware of periods
p32
aVin order to stay decent.
p33
aa(lp34
VResearch in various parts of India
p35
aVshows that three out of every 10 girls are not aware of menstruation
p36
aVat the time of their first periods.
p37
aVAnd in some parts of Rajasthan
p38
aVthis number is as high as nine out of 10 girls being unaware of it.
p39
aVYou'd be surprised to know
p40
aVthat most of the girls that I have spoken to,
p41
aVwho did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation
p42
aVthought that they have got blood cancer
p43
aVand they're going to die soon.
p44
aa(lp45
VMenstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor
p46
aVfor reproductive tract infections.
p47
aVBut in India, only 12 percent of girls and women
p48
aVhave access to hygienic ways of managing their periods.
p49
aVIf you do the math,
p50
aV88 percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods.
p51
aa(lp52
VI was one of them.
p53
aVI grew up in a small town called Garhwa, in Jharkhand,
p54
aVwhere even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful.
p55
aVSo when I started getting my periods,
p56
aVI began with using rags.
p57
aVAfter every use I would wash and reuse them.
p58
aVBut to store them,
p59
aVI would hide and keep it in a dark, damp place
p60
aVso that nobody finds out that I'm menstruating.
p61
aVDue to repeated washing the rags would become coarse,
p62
aVand I would often get rashes and infections using them.
p63
aa(lp64
VI wore these already for five years until I moved out of that town.
p65
aVAnother issue that periods brought in my life
p66
aVthose of the social restrictions
p67
aVthat are imposed upon our girls and women when they're on their periods.
p68
aVI think you all must be aware of it,
p69
aVbut I'll still list it for the few who don't.
p70
aa(lp71
VI was not allowed to touch or eat pickles.
p72
aVI was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member's bed.
p73
aVI had to wash my bed sheet after every period,
p74
aVeven if it was not stained.
p75
aVI was considered impure
p76
aVand forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance.
p77
aVYou'll find signposts outside temples
p78
aVdenying the entry of menstruating girls and women.
p79
aa(lp80
VIronically,
p81
aVmost of the time it is the older woman
p82
aVwho imposes such restrictions on younger girls in a family.
p83
aVAfter all, they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms.
p84
aVAnd in the absence of any intervention,
p85
aVit is the myth and misconception
p86
aVthat propagate from generation to generation.
p87
aa(lp88
VDuring my years of work in this field,
p89
aVI have even come across stories
p90
aVwhere girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately.
p91
aVThey're not allowed to take baths during periods,
p92
aVand in some households they are even secluded from other family members.
p93
aVAbout 85 percent of girls and women in India
p94
aVwould follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month.
p95
aVCan you imagine what this does
p96
aVto the self-esteem and self-confidence of a young girl?
p97
aVThe psychological trauma that this inflicts,
p98
aVaffecting her personality,
p99
aVher academic performance
p100
aVand every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years?
p101
aa(lp102
VI religiously followed all these restrictive customs for 13 years,
p103
aVuntil a discussion with my partner, Tuhin,
p104
aVchanged my perception about menstruation forever.
p105
aVIn 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing our postgraduation in design.
p106
aVWe fell in love with each other
p107
aVand I was at ease discussing periods with him.
p108
aVTuhin knew little about periods.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VHe was astonished to know that girls get painful cramps
p113
aVand we bleed every month.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VYeah.
p118
aVHe was completely shocked to know
p119
aVabout the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls and women
p120
aVby their own families and their society.
p121
aVIn order to help me with my cramps,
p122
aVhe would go on the Internet and learn more about menstruation.
p123
aVWhen he shared his findings with me,
p124
aVI realized how little I knew about menstruation myself.
p125
aVAnd many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths.
p126
aa(lp127
VThat's when we wondered:
p128
aVif we, being so well educated,
p129
aVwere so ill-informed about menstruation,
p130
aVthere would be millions of girls out there who would be ill-informed, too.
p131
aVTo study \u2014
p132
aVto understand the problem better,
p133
aVI undertook a year-long research to study the lack of awareness about menstruation
p134
aVand the root cause behind it.
p135
aa(lp136
VWhile it is generally believed
p137
aVthat menstrual unawareness and misconception is a rural phenomenon,
p138
aVduring my research,
p139
aVI found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well.
p140
aVAnd it exists with the educated urban class, also.
p141
aVWhile talking to many parents and teachers,
p142
aVI found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about periods
p143
aVbefore they have started getting their menstrual cycle.
p144
aVAnd \u2014
p145
aVbut they lacked the proper means themselves.
p146
aVAnd since it is a taboo,
p147
aVthey feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it.
p148
aa(lp149
VGirls nowadays get their periods in classes six and seven,
p150
aVbut our educational curriculum
p151
aVteaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine.
p152
aVAnd since it is a taboo,
p153
aVteachers still skip the subject altogether.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo school does not teach girls about periods,
p156
aVparents don't talk about it.
p157
aVWhere do the girls go?
p158
aVTwo decades ago and now \u2014
p159
aVnothing has changed.
p160
aVI shared these finding with Tuhin and we wondered:
p161
aVWhat if we could create something
p162
aVthat would help girls understand about menstruation on their own \u2014
p163
aVsomething that would help parents and teachers
p164
aVtalk about periods comfortably to young girls?
p165
aa(lp166
VDuring my research,
p167
aVI was collecting a lot of stories.
p168
aVThese were stories of experiences of girls during their periods.
p169
aVThese stories would make girls curious and interested
p170
aVin talking about menstruation in their close circle.
p171
aVThat's what we wanted.
p172
aVWe wanted something that would make the girls curious
p173
aVand drive them to learn about it.
p174
aVWe wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo we decided to create a comic book,
p177
aVwhere the cartoon characters would enact these stories
p178
aVand educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way.
p179
aVTo represent girls in their different phases of puberty,
p180
aVwe have three characters.
p181
aVPinki, who has not gotten her period yet,
p182
aVJiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book
p183
aVand Mira who has already been getting her period.
p184
aVThere is a fourth character, Priya Didi.
p185
aVThrough her, girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up
p186
aVand menstrual hygiene management.
p187
aa(lp188
VWhile making the book, we took great care
p189
aVthat none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way
p190
aVand that it is culturally sensitive.
p191
aVDuring our prototype testing, we found that the girls loved the book.
p192
aVThey were keen on reading it
p193
aVand knowing more and more about periods on their own.
p194
aVParents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods
p195
aVto young girls using the book,
p196
aVand sometimes even boys were interested in reading it.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
V(Applause)
p201
aa(lp202
VThe comic book helped in creating an environment
p203
aVwhere menstruation ceased to be a taboo.
p204
aVMany of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls
p205
aVand take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in India.
p206
aVAnd one of the volunteers took this prototype to educate young monks
p207
aVand took it to this monastery in Ladakh.
p208
aa(lp209
VWe made the final version of the book, called "Menstrupedia Comic"
p210
aVand launched in September last year.
p211
aVAnd so far,
p212
aVmore than 4,000 girls have been educated by using the book in India and \u2014
p213
aa(lp214
V(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
VThank you.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd 10 different countries.
p221
aVWe are constantly translating the book into different languages
p222
aVand collaborating with local organizations
p223
aVto make this book available in different countries.
p224
aa(lp225
V15 schools in different parts of India
p226
aVhave made this book a part of their school curriculum
p227
aVto teach girls about menstruation.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VI am amazed to see how volunteers,
p232
aVindividuals, parents, teachers, school principals,
p233
aVhave come together
p234
aVand taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities,
p235
aVhave made sure that the girls learn about periods at the right age
p236
aVand helped in breaking this taboo.
p237
aa(lp238
VI dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse,
p239
aVnot a disease,
p240
aVbut a welcoming change in a girl's life.
p241
aVAnd I would \u2014
p242
aa(lp243
V(Applause)
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd I would like to end this
p246
aVwith a small request to all the parents here.
p247
aa(lp248
VDear parents,
p249
aVif you would be ashamed of periods,
p250
aVyour daughters would be, too.
p251
aVSo please be period positive.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VThank you.

VThe idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal.
p5
aVI don't think anyone in this room would disagree.
p6
aVWhat worries me is when politicians with money
p7
aVand charismatic rock stars \u2014
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
Vuse the words,
p12
aV" ... it all just sounds so, so simple."
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, I've got no bucket of money today
p15
aVand I've got no policy to release,
p16
aVand I certainly haven't got a guitar.
p17
aVI'll leave that to others.
p18
aVBut I do have an idea,
p19
aVand that idea is called Housing for Health.
p20
aa(lp21
VHousing for Health works with poor people.
p22
aVIt works in the places where they live,
p23
aVand the work is done to improve their health.
p24
aVOver the last 28 years,
p25
aVthis tough, grinding, dirty work
p26
aVhas been done by literally thousands of people around Australia
p27
aVand, more recently, overseas,
p28
aVand their work has proven
p29
aVthat focused design can improve even the poorest living environments.
p30
aVIt can improve health
p31
aVand it can play a part in reducing, if not eliminating, poverty.
p32
aa(lp33
VI'm going to start where the story began \u2014
p34
aV1985, in Central Australia.
p35
aVA man called Yami Lester, an Aboriginal man,
p36
aVwas running a health service.
p37
aVEighty percent of what walked in the door, in terms of illness,
p38
aVwas infectious disease \u2014
p39
aVthird world, developing world infectious disease,
p40
aVcaused by a poor living environment.
p41
aa(lp42
VYami assembled a team in Alice Springs.
p43
aVHe got a medical doctor.
p44
aVHe got an environmental health guy.
p45
aVAnd he hand-selected a team of local Aboriginal people
p46
aVto work on this project.
p47
aVYami told us at that first meeting,
p48
aV"There's no money," \u2014 always a good start \u2014
p49
aV" ... no money, you have six months,
p50
aVand I want you to start on a project \u2014" which, in his language,
p51
aVhe called "Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku,"
p52
aVwhich, translated, is "a plan to stop people getting sick" \u2014
p53
aVa profound brief.
p54
aVThat was our task.
p55
aa(lp56
VFirst step, the medical doctor went away for about six months.
p57
aVAnd he worked on what were to become these nine health goals \u2014
p58
aVwhat were we aiming at?
p59
aVAfter six months of work, he came to my office
p60
aVand presented me with those nine words on a piece of paper.
p61
aa(lp62
V[The 9 Healthy Living Practices: Washing, clothes, wastewater, nutrition, crowding,
p63
aVanimals, dust, temperature, injury]
p64
aa(lp65
VI was very unimpressed. Big ideas need big words,
p66
aVand preferably a lot of them.
p67
aVThis didn't fit the bill.
p68
aVWhat I didn't see and what you can't see
p69
aVwas that he'd assembled thousands of pages
p70
aVof local, national and international health research
p71
aVthat filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason.
p74
aVThe Aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people
p75
aVwere most commonly illiterate,
p76
aVso the story had to be told in pictures
p77
aVof what these goals were.
p78
aVWe worked with the community,
p79
aVnot telling them what was going to happen
p80
aVin a language they didn't understand.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo we had the goals and each one of these goals \u2014
p83
aVand I won't go through them all \u2014
p84
aVputs at the center the person and their health issue,
p85
aVand it then connects them
p86
aVto the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed
p87
aVto keep their health good.
p88
aVAnd the highest priority, you see on the screen,
p89
aVis washing people once a day, particularly children.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd I hope most of you are thinking,
p92
aV"What? That sounds simple."
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, I'm going to ask you all a very personal question.
p95
aVThis morning before you came,
p96
aVwho could have had a wash using a shower?
p97
aVI'm not going to ask if you had a shower, because I'm too polite.
p98
aVThat's it.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VAll right, I think it's fair to say
p103
aVmost people here could have had a shower this morning.
p104
aa(lp105
VI'm going to ask you to do some more work.
p106
aVI want you all to select one of the houses
p107
aVof the 25 houses you see on the screen.
p108
aVI want you to select one of them and note the position of that house
p109
aVand keep that in your head.
p110
aVHave you all got a house?
p111
aVI'm going to ask you to live there for a few months,
p112
aVso make sure you've got it right.
p113
aVIt's in the northwest of Western Australia, very pleasant place.
p114
aa(lp115
VOK. Let's see if your shower in that house is working.
p116
aVI hear some "Aw!" and I hear some "Ah!"
p117
aa(lp118
VIf you get a green tick, your shower's working.
p119
aVYou and your kids are fine.
p120
aVIf you get a red cross,
p121
aVwell, I've looked carefully around the room
p122
aVand it's not going to make much difference to this crew.
p123
aVWhy? Because you're all too old.
p124
aVI know that's going to come as a shock to some of you, but you are.
p125
aVAnd before you get offended and leave,
p126
aVI've got to say that being too old,
p127
aVin this case, means that pretty much everyone in the room, I think,
p128
aVis over five years of age.
p129
aa(lp130
VWe're really concerned with kids naught to five.
p131
aVAnd why?
p132
aVWashing is the antidote to the sort of bugs,
p133
aVthe common infectious diseases of the eyes, the ears,
p134
aVthe chest and the skin
p135
aVthat, if they occur in the first five years of life,
p136
aVpermanently damage those organs.
p137
aVThey leave a lifelong remnant.
p138
aVThat means that by the age of five,
p139
aVyou can't see as well for the rest of your life.
p140
aVYou can't hear as well for the rest of your life.
p141
aVYou can't breathe as well.
p142
aVYou've lost a third of your lung capacity by the age of five.
p143
aVAnd even skin infection,
p144
aVwhich we originally thought wasn't that big a problem,
p145
aVmild skin infections naught to five give you
p146
aVa greatly increased chance of renal failure,
p147
aVneeding dialysis at age 40.
p148
aVThis is a big deal, so the ticks and crosses on the screen
p149
aVare actually critical for young kids.
p150
aa(lp151
VThose ticks and crosses represent the 7,800 houses
p152
aVwe've looked at nationally around Australia,
p153
aVthe same proportion.
p154
aVWhat you see on the screen \u2014
p155
aV35 percent of those not-so-famous houses
p156
aVlived in by 50,000 indigenous people \u2014
p157
aV35 percent had a working shower.
p158
aVTen percent of those same 7,800 houses had safe electrical systems.
p159
aVAnd 58 percent of those houses had a working toilet.
p160
aVThese are by a simple, standard test.
p161
aVIn the case of the shower:
p162
aVdoes it have hot and cold water, two taps that work,
p163
aVa shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body,
p164
aVand a drain that takes the water away?
p165
aVNot well-designed, not beautiful, not elegant \u2014
p166
aVjust that they function.
p167
aVAnd the same tests for the electrical system
p168
aVand the toilets.
p169
aa(lp170
VHousing for Health projects aren't about measuring failure \u2014
p171
aVthey're actually about improving houses.
p172
aVWe start on day one of every project.
p173
aVWe've learned \u2014 we don't make promises, we don't do reports.
p174
aVWe arrive in the morning with tools, tons of equipment, trades,
p175
aVand we train up a local team on the first day to start work.
p176
aVBy the evening of the first day,
p177
aVa few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning.
p178
aa(lp179
VThat work continues for six to 12 months,
p180
aVuntil all the houses are improved
p181
aVand we've spent our budget of 7,500 dollars total per house.
p182
aVThat's our average budget.
p183
aVAt the end of six months to a year, we test every house again.
p184
aVIt's very easy to spend money.
p185
aVIt's very difficult to improve
p186
aVthe function of all those parts of the house.
p187
aVAnd for a whole house, the nine healthy living practices,
p188
aVwe test, check and fix 250 items in every house.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd these are the results we can get with our 7,500 dollars.
p191
aVWe can get showers up to 86 percent working,
p192
aVwe can get electrical systems up to 77 percent working
p193
aVand we can get 90 percent of toilets working
p194
aVin those 7,500 houses.
p195
aV(Applause)
p196
aa(lp197
VThank you.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Applause)
p200
aa(lp201
VThe teams do a great job, and that's their work.
p202
aa(lp203
VI think there's an obvious question
p204
aVthat I hope you're thinking about.
p205
aVWhy do we have to do this work?
p206
aVWhy are the houses in such poor condition?
p207
aVSeventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance \u2014
p208
aVthe sort of things that happen in all our houses.
p209
aVThings wear out, should have been done by state government or local government,
p210
aVsimply not done, the house doesn't work.
p211
aVTwenty-one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction \u2014
p212
aVliterally things that are built upside down and back to front.
p213
aVThey don't work, we have to fix them.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd if you've lived in Australia in the last 30 years, the final cause \u2014
p216
aVyou will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses.
p217
aVIt's one of the almost rock-solid pieces of evidence
p218
aVwhich I've never seen evidence for,
p219
aVthat's always reeled out as "That's the problem with indigenous housing."
p220
aVWell, nine percent of what we spend is damage,
p221
aVmisuse or abuse of any sort.
p222
aVWe argue strongly that the people living in the house
p223
aVare simply not the problem.
p224
aVAnd we'll go a lot further than that;
p225
aVthe people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution.
p226
aVSeventy-five percent of our national team in Australia \u2014
p227
aVover 75 at the minute \u2014
p228
aVare actually local, indigenous people from the communities we work in.
p229
aVThey do all aspects of the work.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VIn 2010, for example, there were 831,
p234
aVall over Australia, and the Torres Strait Islands,
p235
aVall states, working to improve the houses where they and their families live,
p236
aVand that's an important thing.
p237
aa(lp238
VOur work's always had a focus on health.
p239
aVThat's the key.
p240
aVThe developing world bug, trachoma, causes blindness.
p241
aVIt's a developing-world illness,
p242
aVand yet, the picture you see behind
p243
aVis in an Aboriginal community in the late 1990s,
p244
aVwhere 95 percent of school-aged kids had active trachoma
p245
aVin their eyes, doing damage.
p246
aa(lp247
VOK, what do we do?
p248
aVWell, first thing we do, we get showers working.
p249
aVWhy? Because that flushes the bug out.
p250
aVWe put washing facilities in the school as well,
p251
aVso kids can wash their faces many times during the day.
p252
aVWe wash the bug out.
p253
aa(lp254
VSecond, the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye
p255
aVand lets the bug in quick.
p256
aVSo what do we do?
p257
aVWe call up the doctor of dust, and there is such a person.
p258
aVHe was loaned to us by a mining company.
p259
aVHe controls dust on mining company sites.
p260
aVAnd he came out and, within a day,
p261
aVit worked out that most dust in this community
p262
aVwas within a meter of the ground, the wind-driven dust \u2014
p263
aVso he suggested making mounds to catch the dust
p264
aVbefore it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids.
p265
aVSo we used dirt to stop dust.
p266
aVWe did it. He provided us dust monitors.
p267
aVWe tested and we reduced the dust.
p268
aa(lp269
VThen we wanted to get rid of the bug generally.
p270
aVSo how do we do that?
p271
aVWell, we call up the doctor of flies \u2014 and, yes, there is a doctor of flies.
p272
aVAs our Aboriginal mate said,
p273
aV"You white fellows ought to get out more."
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd the doctor of flies very quickly determined
p278
aVthat there was one fly that carried the bug.
p279
aVHe could give school kids in this community
p280
aVthe beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide.
p281
aVThey could trap the flies, send them to him in Perth.
p282
aVWhen the bug was in the gut,
p283
aVhe'd send back by return post some dung beetles.
p284
aVThe dung beetles ate the camel dung,
p285
aVthe flies died through lack of food,
p286
aVand trachoma dropped.
p287
aVAnd over the year, trachoma dropped radically in this place, and stayed low.
p288
aVWe changed the environment, not just treated the eyes.
p289
aVAnd finally, you get a good eye.
p290
aa(lp291
VAll these small health gains
p292
aVand small pieces of the puzzle make a big difference.
p293
aVThe New South Wales Department of Health,
p294
aVthat radical organization,
p295
aVdid an independent trial over three years
p296
aVto look at 10 years of the work we've been doing
p297
aVin these sorts of projects in New South Wales.
p298
aVAnd they found a 40 percent reduction in hospital admissions
p299
aVfor the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment \u2014
p300
aVa 40 percent reduction.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VJust to show that the principles we've used in Australia
p305
aVcan be used in other places,
p306
aVI'm just going to go to one other place, and that's Nepal.
p307
aVAnd what a beautiful place to go.
p308
aVWe were asked by a small village of 600 people
p309
aVto go in and make toilets where none existed.
p310
aVHealth was poor.
p311
aVWe went in with no grand plan,
p312
aVno grand promises of a great program,
p313
aVjust the offer to build two toilets for two families.
p314
aVIt was during the design of the first toilet
p315
aVthat I went for lunch,
p316
aVinvited by the family into their main room of the house.
p317
aVIt was choking with smoke.
p318
aVPeople were cooking on their only fuel source, green timber.
p319
aVThe smoke coming off that timber is choking,
p320
aVand in an enclosed house, you simply can't breathe.
p321
aVLater we found the leading cause of illness and death
p322
aVin this particular region is through respiratory failure.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo all of a sudden, we had two problems.
p325
aVWe were there originally to look at toilets
p326
aVand get human waste off the ground, that's fine.
p327
aVBut all of a sudden now there was a second problem:
p328
aVHow do we actually get the smoke down?
p329
aVSo two problems, and design should be about more than one thing.
p330
aVSolution: Take human waste, take animal waste,
p331
aVput it into a chamber, out of that, extract biogas,
p332
aVmethane gas.
p333
aVThe gas gives three to four hours cooking a day \u2014
p334
aVclean, smokeless and free for the family.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Applause)
p337
aa(lp338
VI put it to you: is this eliminating poverty?
p339
aVAnd the answer from the Nepali team who's working at the minute would say,
p340
aVdon't be ridiculous \u2014
p341
aVwe have three million more toilets to build
p342
aVbefore we can even make a stab at that claim.
p343
aVAnd I don't pretend anything else.
p344
aa(lp345
VBut as we all sit here today,
p346
aVthere are now over 100 toilets built
p347
aVin this village and a couple nearby.
p348
aVWell over 1,000 people use those toilets.
p349
aVYami Lama, he's a young boy.
p350
aVHe's got significantly less gut infection because he's now got toilets,
p351
aVand there isn't human waste on the ground.
p352
aVKanji Maya, she's a mother, and a proud one.
p353
aVShe's probably right now cooking lunch for her family
p354
aVon biogas, smokeless fuel.
p355
aVHer lungs have got better,
p356
aVand they'll get better as time increases,
p357
aVbecause she's not cooking in the same smoke.
p358
aVSurya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber
p359
aVwhen it's shed the gas, he puts it on his crops.
p360
aVHe's trebled his crop income,
p361
aVmore food for the family and more money for the family.
p362
aVAnd finally Bishnu, the leader of the team,
p363
aVhas now understood that not only have we built toilets,
p364
aVwe've also built a team,
p365
aVand that team is now working in two villages
p366
aVwhere they're training up the next two villages
p367
aVto keep the work expanding.
p368
aVAnd that, to me, is the key.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Applause)
p371
aa(lp372
VPeople are not the problem.
p373
aVWe've never found that.
p374
aVThe problem: poor living environment,
p375
aVpoor housing and the bugs that do people harm.
p376
aVNone of those are limited by geography, by skin color or by religion.
p377
aVNone of them.
p378
aVThe common link between all the work we've had to do
p379
aVis one thing, and that's poverty.
p380
aa(lp381
VNelson Mandela said, in the mid-2000s, not too far from here,
p382
aVhe said that like slavery and apartheid, "Poverty is not natural.
p383
aVIt is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated
p384
aVby the actions of human beings."
p385
aVI want to end by saying
p386
aVit's been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings
p387
aVdoing \u2014 I think \u2014 extraordinary work,
p388
aVthat have actually improved health,
p389
aVand, maybe only in a small way, reduced poverty.
p390
aa(lp391
VThank you very much for your time.

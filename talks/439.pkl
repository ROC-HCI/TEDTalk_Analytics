VThe future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of.
p5
aVI think about this every day; it's quite literally my job.
p6
aVI'm co-founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com.
p7
aVAlex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003,
p8
aVand since then we and our growing global team of contributors
p9
aVhave documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions
p10
aVthat are out there, right now and on the near horizon.
p11
aa(lp12
VIn a little over two years, we've written up about 4,000 items \u2014
p13
aVreplicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas \u2014
p14
aVall providing a path to a future
p15
aVthat's more sustainable, more equitable and more desirable.
p16
aVOur emphasis on solutions is quite intentional.
p17
aVThere are tons of places to go, online and off,
p18
aVif what you want to find is the latest bit of news
p19
aVabout just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving.
p20
aVWe want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it.
p21
aVWe focus primarily on the planet's environment,
p22
aVbut we also address issues of global development,
p23
aVinternational conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies,
p24
aVeven the rise of the so-called Second Superpower
p25
aVand much, much more.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad,
p28
aVbut that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met
p29
aVand the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so.
p30
aVA quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface,
p31
aVbut to give you a sense of what we cover:
p32
aVtools for rapid disaster relief,
p33
aVsuch as this inflatable concrete shelter;
p34
aVinnovative uses of bioscience,
p35
aVsuch as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines;
p36
aVultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices;
p37
aVdistributed power generation using solar power, wind power,
p38
aVocean power, other clean energy sources;
p39
aVultra, ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future;
p40
aVultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now;
p41
aVand better urban design,
p42
aVso you don't need to drive as much in the first place;
p43
aVbio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of
p44
aVthe efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings;
p45
aVdistributed computing projects
p46
aVthat will help us model the future of the climate.
p47
aVAlso, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week
p48
aVat TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging:
p49
aVcradle-to-cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs,
p50
aVthe consequences of extreme longevity,
p51
aVthe One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder.
p52
aa(lp53
VAs a born-in-the-mid-1960s Gen X-er,
p54
aVhurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday,
p55
aVI'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging
p56
aVhas convinced me, much to my own surprise,
p57
aVthat successful responses to the world's problems
p58
aVare nonetheless possible.
p59
aVMoreover, I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes
p60
aVcan really blind you to the very possibility of success.
p61
aVAs Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed,
p62
aV"Pessimism is a luxury of good times ...
p63
aVIn difficult times, pessimism is
p64
aVa self-fulfilling, self-inflicted death sentence."
p65
aVThe truth is, we can build a better world,
p66
aVand we can do so right now.
p67
aVWe have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago,
p68
aVand we're coming up with new ones all the time.
p69
aVWe have the knowledge,
p70
aVand our understanding of the planet improves every day.
p71
aVMost importantly, we have the motive:
p72
aVwe have a world that needs fixing, and nobody's going to do it for us.
p73
aa(lp74
VMany of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out
p75
aVand write up every day have some important aspects in common:
p76
aVtransparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment,
p77
aVand an appreciation of science \u2014 or, more appropriately, science!
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVThe majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging
p80
aVencompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you
p81
aVa few concrete examples of how these principles combine
p82
aVin world-changing ways.
p83
aa(lp84
VWe can see world-changing values in the emergence of tools
p85
aVto make the invisible visible \u2014 that is,
p86
aVto make apparent the conditions of the world around us
p87
aVthat would otherwise be largely imperceptible.
p88
aVWe know that people often change their behavior
p89
aVwhen they can see and understand the impact of their actions.
p90
aVAs a small example, many of us have experienced
p91
aVthe change in driving behavior that comes from having
p92
aVa real time display of mileage showing precisely
p93
aVhow one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency.
p94
aVThe last few years have all seen the rise of innovations
p95
aVin how we measure and display aspects of the world
p96
aVthat can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily.
p97
aVSimple technologies, like wall-mounted devices
p98
aVthat display how much power your household is using,
p99
aVand what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights \u2014
p100
aVthese can actually have a direct positive impact
p101
aVon your energy footprint.
p102
aVCommunity tools, like text messaging, that can tell you
p103
aVwhen pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising
p104
aVor a natural disaster is unfolding,
p105
aVcan give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion.
p106
aVData-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions,
p107
aVor maps of the disappearing polar ice caps,
p108
aVallow us to better understand the context and the flow
p109
aVof processes that affect us all.
p110
aa(lp111
VWe can see world-changing values in research projects
p112
aVthat seek to meet the world's medical needs
p113
aVthrough open access to data and collaborative action.
p114
aVNow, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers,
p115
aVbut I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge-enabled solutions
p116
aVare far more important.
p117
aVFor example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science,
p118
aVmake cutting-edge scientific research free to all \u2014
p119
aVeveryone in the world.
p120
aVAnd actually, a growing number of science publishers
p121
aVare adopting this model.
p122
aVLast year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers
p123
aVaround the world worked together
p124
aVto sequence the genome of the parasite responsible
p125
aVfor some of the developing world's worst diseases:
p126
aVAfrican sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.
p127
aVThat genome data can now be found
p128
aVon open-access genetic data banks around the world,
p129
aVand it's an enormous boon to researchers
p130
aVtrying to come up with treatments.
p131
aVBut my favorite example has to be the global response
p132
aVto the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on
p133
aVworldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.
p134
aVThe U.S. National Research Council
p135
aVin its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically
p136
aVcited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason
p137
aVwhy the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd we can see world-changing values
p140
aVin something as humble as a cell phone.
p141
aVI can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room
p142
aVwho do not use a mobile phone \u2014
p143
aVand where is Aubrey, because I know he doesn't?
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVFor many of us, cell phones have really become
p146
aValmost an extension of ourselves,
p147
aVand we're really now beginning to see the social changes
p148
aVthat mobile phones can bring about.
p149
aVYou may already know some of the big-picture aspects:
p150
aVglobally, more camera phones were sold last year
p151
aVthan any other kind of camera,
p152
aVand a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens,
p153
aVand over the network \u2014 and sometimes enter history books.
p154
aVIn the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers.
p155
aVA study last year showed a direct correlation
p156
aVbetween the growth of mobile phone use
p157
aVand subsequent GDP increases across Africa.
p158
aVIn Kenya, mobile phone minutes
p159
aVhave actually become an alternative currency.
p160
aVThe political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either,
p161
aVfrom text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government,
p162
aVto the Blairwatch Project in the UK,
p163
aVkeeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd it's just going to get more wild.
p167
aVPervasive, always-on networks, high quality sound and video,
p168
aVeven devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket,
p169
aVwill transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate.
p170
aVIt's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone
p171
aVmay be among the world's most important technologies.
p172
aVAnd in this rapidly evolving context,
p173
aVit's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes
p174
aVsomething far more than a medium for social interaction.
p175
aa(lp176
VI've long admired the Witness project,
p177
aVand Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday,
p178
aVin his profoundly moving presentation.
p179
aVAnd I'm just incredibly happy to see the news
p180
aVthat Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal
p181
aVto enable users of digital cameras and camera phones
p182
aVto send in their recordings over the Internet,
p183
aVrather than just hand-carrying the videotape.
p184
aVNot only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue
p185
aVfor documenting abuses,
p186
aVit opens up the program to the growing global digital generation.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow, imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists.
p189
aVImagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence
p190
aVof what's happening to the planet:
p191
aVputting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds,
p192
aVfrom activists and researchers
p193
aVto businesspeople and political figures.
p194
aVIt would highlight the changes that are underway,
p195
aVbut would more importantly give voice
p196
aVto the people who are willing to work
p197
aVto see a new world, a better world, come about.
p198
aVIt would give everyday citizens
p199
aVa chance to play a role in the protection of the planet.
p200
aVIt would be, in essence, an "Earth Witness" project.
p201
aVNow, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness"
p202
aVas part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand,
p203
aVfor what this imaginary project could aspire to,
p204
aVnot to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization.
p205
aVIt could just as easily be called, "Environmental Transparency Project,"
p206
aV"Smart Mobs for Natural Security" \u2014
p207
aVbut Earth Witness is a lot easier to say.
p208
aa(lp209
VNow, many of the people who participate in Earth Witness
p210
aVwould focus on ecological problems, human-caused or otherwise,
p211
aVespecially environmental crimes
p212
aVand significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions.
p213
aVThat's understandable and important.
p214
aVWe need better documentation of what's happening to the planet
p215
aVif we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage.
p216
aVBut the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.
p217
aVIn the best Worldchanging tradition,
p218
aVit might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects
p219
aVand efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.
p220
aVEarth Witness would show us two worlds:
p221
aVthe world we're leaving behind,
p222
aVand the world we're building for generations to come.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is
p225
aVwe could do it today.
p226
aVThe key components are already widely available.
p227
aVCamera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project.
p228
aVAnd for a lot of us, they're as close as we have yet
p229
aVto always-on, widely available information tools.
p230
aVWe may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us
p231
aVwherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones.
p232
aVYou could even imagine a version of this scenario
p233
aVin which people actually build their own phones.
p234
aVOver the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers
p235
aVhave come up with multiple models
p236
aVfor usable, Linux-based mobile phones,
p237
aVand the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.
p238
aVAt the other end of the network, there'd be
p239
aVa server for people to send photos and messages to,
p240
aVaccessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service,
p241
aVsocial networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system.
p242
aVNow, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about,
p243
aVbut for those of you for whom that last sentence
p244
aVwas in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this:
p245
aVthe online part of the Earth Witness project
p246
aVwould be created by the users, working together and working openly.
p247
aVThat's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle
p248
aVof what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more.
p249
aa(lp250
VAn Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot
p251
aVfor all sorts of data about conditions around the planet
p252
aVpicked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.
p253
aVNow, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet,
p254
aVbut students and engineers around the world
p255
aVhave attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers
p256
aVand cheap robots and the backs of pigeons \u2014
p257
aVthat being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine,
p258
aVusing bird-mounted sensors
p259
aVas a way of measuring smog-forming pollution.
p260
aVIt's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing
p261
aVon a phone carried by a person.
p262
aVNow, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new:
p263
aVphone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath,
p264
aVor tell you to worry about too much sun exposure.
p265
aVSwedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes
p266
aVa mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field,
p267
aVuploading the data, displaying the results.
p268
aVEven the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act,
p269
aVdesigning a prototype phone
p270
aVthat has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs.
p271
aa(lp272
VNow, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors
p273
aVon the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together
p274
aVa phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels,
p275
aVthe presence of some biotoxins \u2014
p276
aVpotentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus.
p277
aVYou could see that some kind of system like this
p278
aVwould actually be a really good fit
p279
aVwith Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project.
p280
aVNow, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information
p281
aVand mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.
p282
aVAnd that's worth noting in particular.
p283
aVThe impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two
p284
aVhas been simply phenomenal.
p285
aVDevelopers around the world have come up with
p286
aVan amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps,
p287
aVfrom bus routes and crime statistics
p288
aVto the global progress of avian flu.
p289
aVEarth Witness would take this further, linking what you see
p290
aVwith what thousands or millions of other people see around the world.
p291
aa(lp292
VIt's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished
p293
aVif something like this ever existed.
p294
aVWe'd have a far better \u2014 far better knowledge
p295
aVof what's happening on our planet environmentally
p296
aVthan could be gathered with satellites
p297
aVand a handful of government sensor nets alone.
p298
aVIt would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach
p299
aVto environmental awareness and protection,
p300
aVable to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way \u2014
p301
aVand if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up.
p302
aVAnd most important,
p303
aVyou can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth.
p304
aVThis is a system that could put the next generation
p305
aVat the front lines of gathering environmental data.
p306
aVAnd as we work to figure out ways to mitigate
p307
aVthe worst effects of climate disruption,
p308
aVevery little bit of information matters.
p309
aVA system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us
p310
aVto participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately,
p311
aVthe improvement of the planet itself.
p312
aa(lp313
VNow, as I suggested at the outset,
p314
aVthere are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there,
p315
aVso why have I spent the bulk of my time
p316
aVtelling you about something that doesn't exist?
p317
aVBecause this is what tomorrow could look like:
p318
aVbottom-up, technology-enabled global collaboration
p319
aVto handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced.
p320
aVWe can save the planet, but we can't do it alone \u2014 we need each other.
p321
aVNobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together,
p322
aVmaking use of technological innovations and human communities alike,
p323
aVwe might just be able to fix it ourselves.
p324
aVWe have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models,
p325
aVpowerful tools, and innovative ideas
p326
aVthat can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future.
p327
aVWe don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all;
p328
aVwe already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used.
p329
aVThere's a staggering array of wonders out there,
p330
aVacross diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing:
p331
aVsuccess can be ours if we're willing to try.
p332
aVAnd as we say at Worldchanging,
p333
aVanother world isn't just possible; another world is here.
p334
aVWe just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.

"<p>Unlike the scores of futurists peddling nightmare scenarios of global catastrophe and social meltdown, Jamais Cascio proposes a different, often surprising alternative: <strong>What if human beings, and all of our technology, could actually manage to change things for the better?</strong> The strangely plausible worlds Cascio imagines far outstrip conventional thinking: worlds in which surveillance is universal, networks are embedded in all aspects of life, and the Web augments our very eyesight. But rather than focusing on the obvious Orwellian aspects of these looming changes, Cascio suggests that the rapid democratization of these technologies will be empowering rather than enslaving.</p> <p>After acting as the co-founder of WorldChanging.com, Cascio has, since 2006, made his online home at <a href=\\"http://openthefuture.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">OpenTheFuture.com</a>. Recently, he was part of <a href=\\"http://www.superstructgame.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Superstruct</a>, part of the Institute for the Future&#39;s 2009 Ten-Year Forecast. He&#39;s now working on a set of 50-year scenarios that will serve as framing material for the TYF &amp; Superstruct content.

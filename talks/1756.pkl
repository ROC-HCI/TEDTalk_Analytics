V"Even in purely non-religious terms,
p5
aVhomosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty.
p6
aVIt is a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality \u2014
p7
aVa pitiable flight from life.
p8
aVAs such, it deserves no compassion,
p9
aVit deserves no treatment
p10
aVas minority martyrdom,
p11
aVand it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness."
p12
aa(lp13
VThat's from Time magazine in 1966, when I was three years old.
p14
aVAnd last year, the president of the United States
p15
aVcame out in favor of gay marriage.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Applause)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd my question is, how did we get from there to here?
p20
aVHow did an illness become an identity?
p21
aa(lp22
VWhen I was perhaps six years old,
p23
aVI went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother.
p24
aVAnd at the end of buying our shoes,
p25
aVthe salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home.
p26
aVMy brother wanted a red balloon, and I wanted a pink balloon.
p27
aVMy mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon.
p28
aVBut I said that I definitely wanted the pink one.
p29
aVAnd she reminded me that my favorite color was blue.
p30
aVThe fact that my favorite color now is blue, but I'm still gay \u2014
p31
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p32
aVis evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
V(Applause)
p37
aa(lp38
VWhen I was little, my mother used to say,
p39
aV"The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world.
p40
aVAnd until you have children, you don't know what it's like."
p41
aVAnd when I was little, I took it as the greatest compliment in the world
p42
aVthat she would say that about parenting my brother and me.
p43
aVAnd when I was an adolescent, I thought
p44
aVthat I'm gay, and so I probably can't have a family.
p45
aVAnd when she said it, it made me anxious.
p46
aVAnd after I came out of the closet,
p47
aVwhen she continued to say it, it made me furious.
p48
aVI said, "I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in.
p49
aVAnd I want you to stop saying that."
p50
aa(lp51
VAbout 20 years ago, I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine
p52
aVto write a piece about deaf culture.
p53
aVAnd I was rather taken aback.
p54
aVI had thought of deafness entirely as an illness.
p55
aVThose poor people, they couldn't hear.
p56
aVThey lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?
p57
aVAnd then I went out into the deaf world.
p58
aVI went to deaf clubs.
p59
aVI saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry.
p60
aVI even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee
p61
aVwhere people complained about that slurry Southern signing.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world,
p66
aVI become convinced that deafness was a culture
p67
aVand that the people in the deaf world who said,
p68
aV"We don't lack hearing, we have membership in a culture,"
p69
aVwere saying something that was viable.
p70
aVIt wasn't my culture,
p71
aVand I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it,
p72
aVbut I appreciated that it was a culture
p73
aVand that for the people who were members of it,
p74
aVit felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture.
p75
aVIt felt as valid perhaps even as American culture.
p76
aa(lp77
VThen a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf.
p78
aVAnd when her daughter was born,
p79
aVshe suddenly found herself confronting questions
p80
aVthat now began to seem quite resonant to me.
p81
aVShe was facing the question of what to do with this child.
p82
aVShould she say, "You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?"
p83
aVOr should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity,
p84
aVget involved in the Little People of America,
p85
aVbecome aware of what was happening for dwarfs?
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd I suddenly thought,
p88
aVmost deaf children are born to hearing parents.
p89
aVThose hearing parents tend to try to cure them.
p90
aVThose deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence.
p91
aVMost gay people are born to straight parents.
p92
aVThose straight parents often want them to function
p93
aVin what they think of as the mainstream world,
p94
aVand those gay people have to discover identity later on.
p95
aVAnd here was this friend of mine
p96
aVlooking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter.
p97
aVAnd I thought, there it is again:
p98
aVA family that perceives itself to be normal
p99
aVwith a child who seems to be extraordinary.
p100
aVAnd I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity.
p101
aa(lp102
VThere are vertical identities,
p103
aVwhich are passed down generationally from parent to child.
p104
aVThose are things like ethnicity, frequently nationality, language, often religion.
p105
aVThose are things you have in common with your parents and with your children.
p106
aVAnd while some of them can be difficult,
p107
aVthere's no attempt to cure them.
p108
aVYou can argue that it's harder in the United States \u2014
p109
aVour current presidency notwithstanding \u2014
p110
aVto be a person of color.
p111
aVAnd yet, we have nobody who is trying to ensure
p112
aVthat the next generation of children born to African-Americans and Asians
p113
aVcome out with creamy skin and yellow hair.
p114
aa(lp115
VThere are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group.
p116
aVAnd I call them horizontal identities,
p117
aVbecause the peer group is the horizontal experience.
p118
aVThese are identities that are alien to your parents
p119
aVand that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers.
p120
aVAnd those identities, those horizontal identities,
p121
aVpeople have almost always tried to cure.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd I wanted to look at what the process is
p124
aVthrough which people who have those identities
p125
aVcome to a good relationship with them.
p126
aVAnd it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance
p127
aVthat needed to take place.
p128
aVThere's self-acceptance, there's family acceptance, and there's social acceptance.
p129
aVAnd they don't always coincide.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd a lot of the time, people who have these conditions are very angry
p132
aVbecause they feel as though their parents don't love them,
p133
aVwhen what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them.
p134
aVLove is something that ideally is there unconditionally
p135
aVthroughout the relationship between a parent and a child.
p136
aVBut acceptance is something that takes time.
p137
aVIt always takes time.
p138
aa(lp139
VOne of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown.
p140
aVWhen he was born, he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism,
p141
aVa very disabling condition,
p142
aVand his parents were told that he would never walk, he would never talk,
p143
aVhe would have no intellectual capacity,
p144
aVand he would probably not even recognize them.
p145
aVAnd it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital
p146
aVso that he could die there quietly.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd his mother said she wasn't going to do it.
p149
aVAnd she took her son home.
p150
aVAnd even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages,
p151
aVshe found the best doctor in the country
p152
aVfor dealing with diastrophic dwarfism,
p153
aVand she got Clinton enrolled with him.
p154
aVAnd in the course of his childhood,
p155
aVhe had 30 major surgical procedures.
p156
aVAnd he spent all this time stuck in the hospital
p157
aVwhile he was having those procedures,
p158
aVas a result of which he now can walk.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd while he was there, they sent tutors around to help him with his school work.
p161
aVAnd he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do.
p162
aVAnd he ended up achieving at a level
p163
aVthat had never before been contemplated by any member of his family.
p164
aVHe was the first one in his family, in fact, to go to college,
p165
aVwhere he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car
p166
aVthat accommodated his unusual body.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd his mother told me this story of coming home one day \u2014
p169
aVand he went to college nearby \u2014
p170
aVand she said, "I saw that car, which you can always recognize,
p171
aVin the parking lot of a bar," she said. (Laughter)
p172
aV"And I thought to myself, they're six feet tall, he's three feet tall.
p173
aVTwo beers for them is four beers for him."
p174
aVShe said, "I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him,
p175
aVbut I went home, and I left him eight messages on his cell phone."
p176
aVShe said, "And then I thought,
p177
aVif someone had said to me when he was born
p178
aVthat my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies \u2014 "
p179
aa(lp180
V(Applause)
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd I said to her, "What do you think you did
p183
aVthat helped him to emerge as this charming, accomplished, wonderful person?"
p184
aVAnd she said, "What did I do? I loved him, that's all.
p185
aVClinton just always had that light in him.
p186
aVAnd his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there."
p187
aa(lp188
VI'm going to quote from another magazine of the '60s.
p189
aVThis one is from 1968 \u2014 The Atlantic Monthly, voice of liberal America \u2014
p190
aVwritten by an important bioethicist.
p191
aVHe said, "There is no reason to feel guilty
p192
aVabout putting a Down syndrome child away,
p193
aVwhether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium
p194
aVor in a more responsible, lethal sense.
p195
aVIt is sad, yes \u2014 dreadful. But it carries no guilt.
p196
aVTrue guilt arises only from an offense against a person,
p197
aVand a Down's is not a person."
p198
aa(lp199
VThere's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made
p200
aVin the treatment of gay people.
p201
aVThe fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day.
p202
aVBut we forget how we used to see people who had other differences,
p203
aVhow we used to see people who were disabled,
p204
aVhow inhuman we held people to be.
p205
aVAnd the change that's been accomplished there,
p206
aVwhich is almost equally radical,
p207
aVis one that we pay not very much attention to.
p208
aa(lp209
VOne of the families I interviewed, Tom and Karen Robards,
p210
aVwere taken aback when, as young and successful New Yorkers,
p211
aVtheir first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome.
p212
aVThey thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be,
p213
aVand so they decided they would build a little center \u2014
p214
aVtwo classrooms that they started with a few other parents \u2014
p215
aVto educate kids with D.S.
p216
aVAnd over the years, that center grew into something called the Cooke Center,
p217
aVwhere there are now thousands upon thousands
p218
aVof children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught.
p219
aa(lp220
VIn the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran,
p221
aVthe life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled.
p222
aVThe experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors,
p223
aVthose who are writers, some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe Robards had a lot to do with that.
p226
aVAnd I said, "Do you regret it?
p227
aVDo you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome?
p228
aVDo you wish you'd never heard of it?"
p229
aVAnd interestingly his father said,
p230
aV"Well, for David, our son, I regret it,
p231
aVbecause for David, it's a difficult way to be in the world,
p232
aVand I'd like to give David an easier life.
p233
aVBut I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome, it would be a catastrophic loss."
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd Karen Robards said to me, "I'm with Tom.
p236
aVFor David, I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life.
p237
aVBut speaking for myself \u2014 well, I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born
p238
aVthat I could come to such a point \u2014
p239
aVspeaking for myself, it's made me so much better and so much kinder
p240
aVand so much more purposeful in my whole life,
p241
aVthat speaking for myself, I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world."
p242
aa(lp243
VWe live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions
p244
aVis on the up and up.
p245
aVAnd yet we also live at the moment
p246
aVwhen our ability to eliminate those conditions
p247
aVhas reached a height we never imagined before.
p248
aVMost deaf infants born in the United States now
p249
aVwill receive Cochlear implants,
p250
aVwhich are put into the brain and connected to a receiver,
p251
aVand which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech.
p252
aVA compound that has been tested in mice, BMN-111,
p253
aVis useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene.
p254
aVAchondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism,
p255
aVand mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene,
p256
aVgrow to full size.
p257
aVTesting in humans is around the corner.
p258
aVThere are blood tests which are making progress
p259
aVthat would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before,
p260
aVmaking it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies,
p261
aVor to terminate them.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd so we have both social progress and medical progress.
p264
aVAnd I believe in both of them.
p265
aVI believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful,
p266
aVand I think the same thing about the medical progress.
p267
aVBut I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other.
p268
aVAnd when I see the way they're intersecting
p269
aVin conditions like the three I've just described,
p270
aVI sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera
p271
aVwhen the hero realizes he loves the heroine
p272
aVat the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VWe have to think about how we feel about cures altogether.
p277
aVAnd a lot of the time the question of parenthood is,
p278
aVwhat do we validate in our children,
p279
aVand what do we cure in them?
p280
aa(lp281
VJim Sinclair, a prominent autism activist, said,
p282
aV"When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism,'
p283
aVwhat they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist
p284
aVand I had a different, non-autistic child instead.'
p285
aVRead that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence.
p286
aVThis is what we hear when you pray for a cure \u2014
p287
aVthat your fondest wish for us
p288
aVis that someday we will cease to be
p289
aVand strangers you can love will move in behind our faces."
p290
aVIt's a very extreme point of view,
p291
aVbut it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have
p292
aVand they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated.
p293
aVThey want to be whoever it is that they've come to be.
p294
aa(lp295
VOne of the families I interviewed for this project
p296
aVwas the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.
p297
aVIt took a long time to persuade them to talk to me,
p298
aVand once they agreed, they were so full of their story
p299
aVthat they couldn't stop telling it.
p300
aVAnd the first weekend I spent with them \u2014 the first of many \u2014
p301
aVI recorded more than 20 hours of conversation.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd on Sunday night, we were all exhausted.
p304
aVWe were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner.
p305
aVAnd I said, "If Dylan were here now,
p306
aVdo you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him?"
p307
aVAnd his father said, "I sure do.
p308
aVI'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing."
p309
aVAnd Sue looked at the floor, and she thought for a minute.
p310
aVAnd then she looked back up and said,
p311
aV"I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother
p312
aVand never knowing what was going on inside his head."
p313
aa(lp314
VWhen I had dinner with her a couple of years later \u2014
p315
aVone of many dinners that we had together \u2014
p316
aVshe said, "You know, when it first happened,
p317
aVI used to wish that I had never married, that I had never had children.
p318
aVIf I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom,
p319
aVthis child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened.
p320
aVBut I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much
p321
aVthat I don't want to imagine a life without them.
p322
aVI recognize the pain they caused to others, for which there can be no forgiveness,
p323
aVbut the pain they caused to me, there is," she said.
p324
aV"So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world
p325
aVif Dylan had never been born,
p326
aVI've decided that it would not have been better for me."
p327
aa(lp328
VI thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems,
p329
aVproblems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid,
p330
aVand that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting.
p331
aVAnd then I thought, all of us who have children
p332
aVlove the children we have, with their flaws.
p333
aVIf some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling
p334
aVand offered to take away the children I have
p335
aVand give me other, better children \u2014 more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter \u2014
p336
aVI would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle.
p337
aVAnd ultimately I feel
p338
aVthat in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno
p339
aVto ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove,
p340
aVso these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences
p341
aVreflect on the universal experience of parenting,
p342
aVwhich is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think,
p343
aVwhere did you come from?
p344
aa(lp345
V(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VIt turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed \u2014
p348
aVthere are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia,
p349
aVthere are only so many families of children who are transgender,
p350
aVthere are only so many families of prodigies \u2014
p351
aVwho also face similar challenges in many ways \u2014
p352
aVthere are only so many families in each of those categories \u2014
p353
aVbut if you start to think
p354
aVthat the experience of negotiating difference within your family
p355
aVis what people are addressing,
p356
aVthen you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon.
p357
aVIronically, it turns out, that it's our differences, and our negotiation of difference,
p358
aVthat unite us.
p359
aa(lp360
VI decided to have children while I was working on this project.
p361
aVAnd many people were astonished and said,
p362
aV"But how can you decide to have children
p363
aVin the midst of studying everything that can go wrong?"
p364
aVAnd I said, "I'm not studying everything that can go wrong.
p365
aVWhat I'm studying is how much love there can be,
p366
aVeven when everything appears to be going wrong."
p367
aa(lp368
VI thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen,
p369
aVa severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect.
p370
aVAnd when his ashes were interred, his mother said,
p371
aV"I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed,
p372
aVonce of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved."
p373
aVAnd I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child
p374
aVif they had the effective will to do so.
p375
aa(lp376
VSo my husband is the biological father of two children
p377
aVwith some lesbian friends in Minneapolis.
p378
aVI had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children.
p379
aVAnd so she and I have a daughter,
p380
aVand mother and daughter live in Texas.
p381
aVAnd my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time
p382
aVof whom I am the biological father,
p383
aVand our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura,
p384
aVthe lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis.
p385
aa(lp386
V(Applause)
p387
aa(lp388
VSo the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states.
p389
aa(lp390
VAnd there are people who think that the existence of my family
p391
aVsomehow undermines or weakens or damages their family.
p392
aVAnd there are people who think that families like mine
p393
aVshouldn't be allowed to exist.
p394
aVAnd I don't accept subtractive models of love, only additive ones.
p395
aVAnd I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity
p396
aVto ensure that the planet can go on,
p397
aVso we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family
p398
aVin order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness.
p399
aa(lp400
VThe day after our son was born,
p401
aVthe pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned.
p402
aVHe wasn't extending his legs appropriately.
p403
aVShe said that might mean that he had brain damage.
p404
aVIn so far as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically,
p405
aVwhich she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action.
p406
aVAnd he had a very large head, which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus.
p407
aa(lp408
VAnd as she told me all of these things,
p409
aVI felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor.
p410
aVAnd I thought, here I had been working for years
p411
aVon a book about how much meaning people had found
p412
aVin the experience of parenting children who are disabled,
p413
aVand I didn't want to join their number.
p414
aVBecause what I was encountering was an idea of illness.
p415
aVAnd like all parents since the dawn of time,
p416
aVI wanted to protect my child from illness.
p417
aVAnd I wanted also to protect myself from illness.
p418
aVAnd yet, I knew from the work I had done
p419
aVthat if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for,
p420
aVthat those would ultimately be his identity,

VWe took him to the MRI machine, we took him to the CAT scanner,
p425
aVwe took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw.
p426
aVWe felt helpless.
p427
aVAnd at the end of five hours,
p428
aVthey said that his brain was completely clear
p429
aVand that he was by then extending his legs correctly.
p430
aVAnd when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on,
p431
aVshe said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp.
p432
aa(lp433
V(Laughter)
p434
aa(lp435
VBut I thought how my mother was right.
p436
aVI thought, the love you have for your children
p437
aVis unlike any other feeling in the world,
p438
aVand until you have children, you don't know what it feels like.
p439
aa(lp440

p441
aVthe moment I connected fatherhood with loss.
p442
aVBut I'm not sure I would have noticed that
p443
aVif I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine.
p444
aVI'd encountered so much strange love,
p445
aVand I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns.
p446
aVAnd I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities.
p447
aa(lp448
VDuring these 10 years, I had witnessed and learned
p449
aVthe terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility,
p450
aVand I had come to see how it conquers everything else.
p451
aVAnd while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools,
p452
aVenslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children
p453
aVand trying to breed identity out of misery,
p454
aVI realized that day that my research had built me a plank
p455
aVand that I was ready to join them on their ship.
p456
aa(lp457
VThank you.

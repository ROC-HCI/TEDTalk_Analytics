VI think it was in my second grade that I was caught
p5
aVdrawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo.
p6
aVI was sent straight away to my school principal,
p7
aVand my school principal, a sweet nun,
p8
aVlooked at my book with disgust,
p9
aVflipped through the pages, saw all the nudes \u2014
p10
aVyou know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her \u2014
p11
aVand the nun slapped me on my face and said,
p12
aV"Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun."
p13
aa(lp14
VI had no clue what she was talking about,
p15
aVbut it was convincing enough for me never to draw again
p16
aVuntil the ninth grade.
p17
aVThanks to a really boring lecture,
p18
aVI started caricaturing my teachers in school.
p19
aVAnd, you know, I got a lot of popularity.
p20
aVI don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports.
p21
aVI don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.
p22
aVI'm not on top of the class.
p23
aVSo for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity.
p24
aVI got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again.
p25
aVSo what I did was I quickly put together
p26
aVa collage of all the teachers I had drawn,
p27
aVglorified my school principal, put him right on top,
p28
aVand gifted it to him.
p29
aVHe had a good laugh at the other teachers
p30
aVand put it up on the notice board.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVThis is a part of that.
p33
aVAnd I became a school hero.
p34
aVAll my seniors knew me. I felt really special.
p35
aa(lp36
VI have to tell you a little bit about my family.
p37
aVThat's my mother. I love her to bits.
p38
aVShe's the one who taught me how to draw and, more importantly, how to love.
p39
aVShe's a bit of a hippie.
p40
aVShe said, "Don't say that," but I'm saying it anyway.
p41
aVThe rest of my family are boring academics,
p42
aVbusy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car.
p43
aVMy father's a little different.
p44
aVMy father believed in a holistic approach to living,
p45
aVand, you know, every time he taught us,
p46
aVhe'd say, "I hate these books,
p47
aVbecause these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution."
p48
aa(lp49
VWhile he still held that worldview, I was 16,
p50
aVI got the best lawyer in town,
p51
aVmy older brother Karthik,
p52
aVand I sat him down, and I said, "Pa,
p53
aVfrom today onwards I've decided
p54
aVI'm going to be disciplined,
p55
aVI'm going to be curious,
p56
aVI'm going to learn something new every day,
p57
aVI'm going to be very hard working,
p58
aVand I'm not going to depend on you
p59
aVemotionally or financially."
p60
aVAnd he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me.
p61
aVAnd I said, "Hold that thought."
p62
aVI said, "Can I quit school then?"
p63
aa(lp64
VBut, to cut a long story short,
p65
aVI quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.
p66
aVI must have done about 30,000 caricatures.
p67
aVI would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces,
p68
aVanything for anyone who wanted to use my services.
p69
aVBut, most importantly, while I was traveling,
p70
aVI taught children cartooning,
p71
aVand in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous.
p72
aVAnd mad and crazy and fun.
p73
aVWhen I started teaching them, I said let me start doing this professionally.
p74
aVWhen I was 18 I started my own school.
p75
aVHowever, an 18 year-old trying to start a school
p76
aVis not easy unless you have a big patron
p77
aVor a big supporter.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India
p80
aVwhen I saw that the Prime Minister of India
p81
aVwas visiting my home town, Bangalore.
p82
aVAnd, you know, just like how
p83
aVevery cartoonist knows Bush here,
p84
aVand if you had to meet Bush,
p85
aVit would be the funnest thing because
p86
aVhis face was a cartoonist's delight.
p87
aVI had to meet my Prime Minister.
p88
aVI went to the place where
p89
aVhis helicopter was about to land.
p90
aVI saw layers of security.
p91
aVI caricatured my way through three layers
p92
aVby just impressing the guards,
p93
aVbut I got stuck. I got stuck at the third.
p94
aVAnd what happened was, to my luck,
p95
aVI saw a nuclear scientist
p96
aVat whose party I had done cartoons.
p97
aVI ran up to him, and said, "Hello, sir. How do you do?"
p98
aVHe said, "What are you doing here, Raghava?"
p99
aVI said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister."
p100
aVHe said, "Oh, so am I."
p101
aVI hopped into his car, and off we went
p102
aVthrough the remaining layers of security.
p103
aV(Applause)
p104
aVThank you.
p105
aVI sat him down, I caricatured him,
p106
aVand since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis is one I remember fondly.
p109
aVSalman Rushdie was pissed-off I think
p110
aVbecause I altered the map of New York, if you notice.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVAnyway, the next slide I'm about to show you \u2014
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVShould I just turn that off?
p115
aVThe next slide I'm about to show you,
p116
aVis a little more serious.
p117
aVI was hesitant to include this in my presentation
p118
aVbecause this cartoon was published
p119
aVsoon after 9/11.
p120
aVWhat was, for me, a very naive observation,
p121
aVturned out to be a disaster.
p122
aVThat evening, I came home to hundreds of hate mails,
p123
aVhundreds of people telling me how they
p124
aVcould have lived another day without seeing this.
p125
aVI was also asked to leave the organization,
p126
aVa cartoonists' organization in America,
p127
aVthat for me was my lifeline.
p128
aVThat's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful,
p129
aVart comes with responsibility.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnyway, what I did was I decided
p132
aVthat I need to take a break.
p133
aVI quit my job at the papers, I closed my school,
p134
aVand I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks,
p135
aVand I decided to go traveling.
p136
aVWhen I went traveling, I remember,
p137
aVI met this fabulous old man,
p138
aVwho I met when I was caricaturing,
p139
aVwho turned out to be an artist, in Italy.
p140
aVHe invited me to his studio. He said, "Come and visit."
p141
aVWhen I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever.
p142
aVI saw this dead, naked effigy of himself
p143
aVhanging from the ceiling.
p144
aVI said, "Oh, my God. What is that?"
p145
aVAnd I asked him, and he said,
p146
aV"Oh, that thing? In the night, I die.
p147
aVIn the morning, I am born again."
p148
aVI thought he was koo koo,
p149
aVbut something about that really stuck.
p150
aVI loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that.
p151
aVSo I said, "I am dead, so I need to be born again."
p152
aa(lp153
VSo, I wanted to be a painter like him,
p154
aVexcept, I don't know how to paint.
p155
aVSo, I tried going to the art store.
p156
aVYou know, there are a hundred types of brushes.
p157
aVForget it, they will confuse you
p158
aVeven if you know how to draw.
p159
aVSo I decided, I'm going to learn to paint by myself.
p160
aVI'm going to show you a very quick clip
p161
aVto show you how I painted and a little bit
p162
aVabout my city, Bangalore.
p163
aV(Music)
p164
aVThey had to be larger than life.
p165
aVEverything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger.
p166
aVAnd even bigger.
p167
aVAnd for me it was, I had to dance while I painted.
p168
aVIt was so exciting.
p169
aVExcept, I even started painting dancers.
p170
aVHere for example is a Flamenco dancer,
p171
aVexcept there was one problem.
p172
aVI didn't know the dance form, so I started following them,
p173
aVand I made some money,
p174
aVsold my paintings and would rush off
p175
aVto France or Spain and work with them.
p176
aVThat's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer.
p177
aa(lp178
VBut I had one problem, my paintings never danced.
p179
aVAs much energy as I put into them
p180
aVwhile making them, they never danced.
p181
aVSo I decided \u2014 I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning.
p182
aVI called my friends, painted on their bodies,
p183
aVand had them dance in front of a painting.
p184
aVAnd, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive.
p185
aVAnd then I was fortunate enough
p186
aVto actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus.
p187
aVAnd I sat like you guys there in the audience.
p188
aVAnd I saw my work come alive.
p189
aVYou know, normally you work in isolation,
p190
aVand you show at a gallery,
p191
aVbut here, the work was coming alive,
p192
aVand it had some other artists working with me.
p193
aa(lp194
VThe collaborative effort was fabulous.
p195
aVI said, I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet.
p196
aVI started doing fashion.
p197
aVThis is a fashion show we held in London.
p198
aVThe best collaboration, of course, is with children.
p199
aVThey are ruthless, they are honest,
p200
aVbut they're full of energy and fun.
p201
aVThis is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation.
p202
aVAnd I must say, I spent time in the Bronx
p203
aVworking with these kids.
p204
aVAnd, in exchange for me working with them,
p205
aVthey taught me how to be cool.
p206
aVI don't think I've succeeded, but they've taught me.
p207
aVThey said, "Stop saying sorry. Say, my bad."
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VThen I said, all this is good,
p211
aVbut I want to paint like a real painter.
p212
aVAmerican education is so expensive.
p213
aVI was in India, and I was walking down the streets,
p214
aVand I saw a billboard painter.
p215
aVAnd these guys paint humongous paintings,
p216
aVand they look really good.
p217
aVAnd I wondered how they did it from so close.
p218
aVSo, one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys,
p219
aVand I said, "How do you paint like that? Who taught you?"
p220
aVAnd he said, "Oh, it's very easy. I can teach you,
p221
aVbut we're leaving the city,
p222
aVbecause billboard painters are a dying,
p223
aVextinct bunch of artists,
p224
aVbecause digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them."
p225
aVI said, in exchange for education in how to paint,
p226
aVI will support them, and I started a company.
p227
aVAnd since then, I've been painting all over the place.
p228
aVThis is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment.
p229
aVThis is another painting.
p230
aVAnd, in fact, I started painting on anything,
p231
aVand started sending them around town.
p232
aa(lp233
VSince I mentioned my wife, the most important collaboration
p234
aVhas been with her, Netra.
p235
aVNetra and I met when she was 18.
p236
aVI must have been 19 and a half then,
p237
aVand it was love at first sight.
p238
aVI lived in India. She lived in America.
p239
aVShe'd come every two months to visit me,
p240
aVand then I said I'm the man,
p241
aVI'm the man, and I have to reciprocate.
p242
aVI have to travel seven oceans, and I have to come and see you.
p243
aVI did that twice, and I went broke.
p244
aVSo then I said, "Nets, what do I do?"
p245
aVShe said, "Why don't you send me your paintings?
p246
aVMy dad knows a bunch of rich guys.
p247
aVWe'll try and con them into buying it,
p248
aVand then..."
p249
aVBut it turned out, after I sent the works to her,
p250
aVthat her dad's friends,
p251
aVlike most of you, are geeks.
p252
aVI'm joking.
p253
aV(Laughter)
p254
aVNo, they were really big geeks,
p255
aVand they didn't know much about art.
p256
aVSo Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo what we did was we rented a little van
p259
aVand we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it.
p260
aVShe contacted anyone and everyone
p261
aVwho was willing to buy my work.
p262
aVShe made enough money, she sold off the whole collection
p263
aVand made enough money to move me for four years
p264
aVwith lawyers, a company, everything,
p265
aVand she became my manager.
p266
aVThat's us in New York.
p267
aVNotice one thing,
p268
aVwe're equal here.
p269
aVSomething happened along the line.
p270
aV(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VBut this brought me \u2014 with Netra managing my career \u2014
p273
aVit brought me a lot of success.
p274
aVI was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar.
p275
aVI loved the attention.
p276
aVThis is all the press we got, and we said,
p277
aVit's time to celebrate.
p278
aVAnd I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra.
p279
aVI said, "Let's get married."
p280
aVAnd I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us,
p281
aVall the people who bought our work."
p282
aVAnd you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people,
p283
aVwho had made a difference \u2014 a ridiculous list,
p284
aVbut I was determined to bring them to India, so \u2014
p285
aVa lot of them were in India.
p286
aV150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding.
p287
aVWe had fashion designers, installation artists,
p288
aVmodels, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers,
p289
aVall kinds of people working with me
p290
aVto make my wedding an art installation.
p291
aVAnd I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws.
p292
aVI had the vegetable carvers work on that for me.
p293
aa(lp294
VBut all this excitement led
p295
aVto the press writing about us.
p296
aVWe were in the papers, we're still in the news three years later,
p297
aVbut, unfortunately, something tragic happened right after.
p298
aVMy mother fell very ill.
p299
aVI love my mother
p300
aVand I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die.
p301
aVAnd they said you have to say bye to her,
p302
aVyou have to do what you have to do.
p303
aVAnd I was devastated.
p304
aVI had shows booked up for another year.
p305
aVI was on a high.
p306
aVAnd I couldn't. I could not.
p307
aa(lp308
VMy life was not exuberant.
p309
aVI could not live this larger than life person.
p310
aVI started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind.
p311
aVOf course, my work turned ugly,
p312
aVbut another thing happened.
p313
aVI lost all my audiences.
p314
aVThe Bollywood stars who I would party with
p315
aVand buy my work disappeared.
p316
aVThe collectors, the friends, the press,
p317
aVeveryone said, "Nice, but thank you."
p318
aV"No thank you," was more like it.
p319
aVBut I wanted people to actually
p320
aVfeel my work from their gut,
p321
aVbecause I was painting it from my gut.
p322
aVIf they wanted beauty,
p323
aVI said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized.
p324
aVOf course, none of them liked it.
p325
aa(lp326
VMy works also turned autobiographical.
p327
aVAt this point, something else happened.
p328
aVA very, very dear friend of mine
p329
aVcame out of the closet,
p330
aVand in India at that time, it was illegal to be gay,
p331
aVand it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person.
p332
aVI was very upset.
p333
aVI remember the time when my mother used to dress me up
p334
aVas a little girl \u2014 that's me there \u2014
p335
aVbecause she wanted a girl, and she has only boys.
p336
aV(Laughter)
p337
aVAnyway, I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk.
p338
aVIt's a secret.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo, after this, my works turned a little violent.
p341
aVI talked about this masculinity that one need not perform.
p342
aVAnd I talked about the weakness of male sexuality.
p343
aVThis time, not only did my collectors disappear,
p344
aVthe political activists decided to ban me
p345
aVand to threaten me
p346
aVand to forbid me from showing.
p347
aVIt turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken.
p348
aVI can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo, I decided it was time
p351
aVto end and go back home.
p352
aVThis time I said let's try something different.
p353
aVI need to be reborn again.
p354
aVAnd I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children,
p355
aVthe best way to have a new lease on life,
p356
aVis to have a child.
p357
aVI decided to have a child,
p358
aVand before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong.
p359
aVHow can a family get dysfunctional?
p360
aVAnd Rudra was born.
p361
aVThat's my little son.
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd two magical things happened after he was born.
p364
aVMy mother miraculously recovered
p365
aVafter a serious operation,
p366
aVand this man was elected president of this country.
p367
aVYou know I sat at home and I watched.
p368
aVI teared up and I said that's where I want to be.
p369
aVSo Netra and I wound up our life,
p370
aVclosed up everything we had,
p371
aVand we decided to move to New York.
p372
aVAnd this was just eight months ago.
p373
aa(lp374
VI moved back to New York, my work has changed.
p375
aVEverything about my work has become more whimsical.
p376
aVThis one is called "What the Fuck Was I Thinking?"
p377
aVIt talks about mental incest.
p378
aVYou know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy.
p379
aVBut I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything.
p380
aVBut I'm very civil in my action, I assure you.
p381
aV(Laughter)
p382
aVThese are just different cartoons.
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd, before I go, I want to tell you a little story.
p385
aVI was talking to mother and father this morning,
p386
aVand my dad said, "I know you have so much you want to say,
p387
aVbut you have to talk about your work with children."
p388
aVSo I said, okay.
p389
aa(lp390
VI work with children all over the world,
p391
aVand that's an entirely different talk,
p392
aVbut I want to leave you with one story
p393
aVthat really, really inspired me.
p394
aVI met Belinda when she was 16.
p395
aVI was 17.
p396
aVI was in Australia,
p397
aVand Belinda had cancer,
p398
aVand I was told she's not going to live very long.
p399
aVThey, in fact, told me three weeks.
p400
aVI walk into her room, and there was a shy girl,
p401
aVand she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness.
p402
aVI whipped out my pen, and I started drawing on her head
p403
aVand I drew a crown for her.
p404
aVAnd then, we started talking, and we spent a lovely time \u2014
p405
aVI told her how I ended up in Australia,
p406
aVhow I backpacked and who I conned, and how I got a ticket,
p407
aVand all the stories.
p408
aVAnd I drew it out for her.
p409
aVAnd then I left.
p410
aVBelinda died
p411
aVand within a few days of her death,
p412
aVthey published a book for her,
p413
aVand she used my cartoon on the cover.
p414
aVAnd she wrote a little note, she said,
p415
aV"Hey Rags, thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world."
p416
aa(lp417
VFor me, my art is my magic carpet ride.
p418
aVI hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride,
p419
aVand touch children and be honest.
p420
aVThank you so much.
p421
aV(Applause)

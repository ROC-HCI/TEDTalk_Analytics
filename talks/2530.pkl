VWhat an intriguing group of individuals you are ...
p5
aVto a psychologist.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VI've had the opportunity over the last couple of days
p10
aVof listening in on some of your conversations
p11
aVand watching you interact with each other.
p12
aVAnd I think it's fair to say, already,
p13
aVthat there are 47 people in this audience,
p14
aVat this moment,
p15
aVdisplaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd I thought you might like to know who you are.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VBut instead of pointing at you,
p24
aVwhich would be gratuitous and intrusive,
p25
aVI thought I would tell you a few facts and stories,
p26
aVin which you may catch a glimpse of yourself.
p27
aa(lp28
VI'm in the field of research known as personality psychology,
p29
aVwhich is part of a larger personality science
p30
aVwhich spans the full spectrum, from neurons to narratives.
p31
aVAnd what we try to do,
p32
aVin our own way,
p33
aVis to make sense of how each of us \u2014
p34
aVeach of you \u2014
p35
aVis, in certain respects,
p36
aVlike all other people,
p37
aVlike some other people
p38
aVand like no other person.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, already you may be saying of yourself,
p41
aV"I'm not intriguing.
p42
aVI am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere."
p43
aVOr you may say of yourself,
p44
aV"I am intriguing,
p45
aVeven if I am regarded by most people as a great, thundering twit."
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VBut it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent "twitiness"
p50
aVthat makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you.
p51
aVSo let me explain why this is so.
p52
aa(lp53
VOne of the most influential approaches in personality science
p54
aVis known as trait psychology,
p55
aVand it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed,
p56
aVand that describe universally held aspects of difference between people.
p57
aVThey spell out the acronym OCEAN.
p58
aVSo, "O" stands for "open to experience,"
p59
aVversus those who are more closed.
p60
aV"C" stands for "conscientiousness,"
p61
aVin contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life.
p62
aV"E" \u2014 "extroversion," in contrast to more introverted people.
p63
aV"A" \u2014 "agreeable individuals,"
p64
aVin contrast to those decidedly not agreeable.
p65
aVAnd "N" \u2014 "neurotic individuals,"
p66
aVin contrast to those who are more stable.
p67
aa(lp68
VAll of these dimensions have implications for our well-being,
p69
aVfor how our life goes.
p70
aVAnd so we know that, for example,
p71
aVopenness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success,
p72
aVbut the open people achieve that success through being audacious
p73
aVand, occasionally, odd.
p74
aVThe conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines,
p75
aVto persevering, as well as having some passion.
p76
aVExtroversion and agreeableness are both conducive
p77
aVto working well with people.
p78
aVExtroverts, for example, I find intriguing.
p79
aVWith my classes, I sometimes give them a basic fact
p80
aVthat might be revealing with respect to their personality:
p81
aVI tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults
p82
aVto lick the outside of their own elbow.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VDid you know that?
p87
aVAlready, some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow.
p88
aVBut extroverts amongst you
p89
aVare probably those who have not only tried,
p90
aVbut they have successfully licked the elbow
p91
aVof the person sitting next to them.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VThose are the extroverts.
p96
aa(lp97
VLet me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion,
p98
aVbecause it's consequential and it's intriguing,
p99
aVand it helps us understand what I call our three natures.
p100
aVFirst, our biogenic nature \u2014 our neurophysiology.
p101
aVSecond, our sociogenic or second nature,
p102
aVwhich has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives.
p103
aVAnd third, what makes you individually you \u2014 idiosyncratic \u2014
p104
aVwhat I call your "idiogenic" nature.
p105
aa(lp106
VLet me explain.
p107
aVOne of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation.
p108
aVAnd that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting:
p109
aVloud noises, parties and social events here at TED \u2014
p110
aVyou see the extroverts forming a magnetic core.
p111
aVThey all gather together.
p112
aVAnd I've seen you.
p113
aVThe introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces
p114
aVup on the second floor,
p115
aVwhere they are able to reduce stimulation \u2014
p116
aVand may be misconstrued as being antisocial,
p117
aVbut you're not necessarily antisocial.
p118
aVIt may be that you simply realize that you do better
p119
aVwhen you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation.
p120
aa(lp121
VSometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body.
p122
aVCaffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts.
p123
aVWhen extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning
p124
aVand say, "I really need a cup of coffee,"
p125
aVthey're not kidding \u2014
p126
aVthey really do.
p127
aVIntroverts do not do as well,
p128
aVparticularly if the tasks they're engaged in \u2014
p129
aVand they've had some coffee \u2014
p130
aVif those tasks are speeded,
p131
aVand if they're quantitative,
p132
aVintroverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative.
p133
aVBut it's a misconstrual.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing:
p136
aVwe're not always what seem to be,
p137
aVand that takes me to my next point.
p138
aVI should say, before getting to this,
p139
aVsomething about sexual intercourse,
p140
aValthough I may not have time.
p141
aVAnd so, if you would like me to \u2014
p142
aVyes, you would?
p143
aVOK.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VThere are studies done
p148
aVon the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act,
p149
aVas broken down by male, female; introvert, extrovert.
p150
aVSo I ask you:
p151
aVHow many times per minute \u2014
p152
aVoh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study \u2014
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VHow many times per month
p157
aVdo introverted men engage in the act?
p158
aV3.0.
p159
aVExtroverted men?
p160
aVMore or less?
p161
aVYes, more.
p162
aV5.5 \u2014 almost twice as much.
p163
aVIntroverted women: 3.1.
p164
aVExtroverted women?
p165
aVFrankly, speaking as an introverted male,
p166
aVwhich I will explain later \u2014
p167
aVthey are heroic.
p168
aV7.5.
p169
aVThey not only handle all the male extroverts,
p170
aVthey pick up a few introverts as well.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VWe communicate differently, extroverts and introverts.
p177
aVExtroverts, when they interact,
p178
aVwant to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness.
p179
aVThey'd like to stand close for comfortable communication.
p180
aVThey like to have a lot of eye contact,
p181
aVor mutual gaze.
p182
aVWe found in some research
p183
aVthat they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody.
p184
aVSo when an extrovert meets a Charles,
p185
aVit rapidly becomes "Charlie," and then "Chuck,"
p186
aVand then "Chuckles Baby."
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VWhereas for introverts,
p191
aVit remains "Charles," until he's given a pass to be more intimate
p192
aVby the person he's talking to.
p193
aVWe speak differently.
p194
aVExtroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language.
p195
aVIntroverts prefer \u2014 and I must again tell you
p196
aVthat I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine \u2014
p197
aVwe speak differently.
p198
aVWe prefer contextually complex,
p199
aVcontingent,
p200
aVweasel-word sentences \u2014
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VMore or less.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VAs it were.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VNot to put too fine a point upon it \u2014
p213
aVlike that.
p214
aa(lp215
VWhen we talk,
p216
aVwe sometimes talk past each other.
p217
aVI had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague
p218
aVwho's as different from me as two people can possibly be.
p219
aVFirst, his name is Tom.
p220
aVMine isn't.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VSecondly, he's six foot five.
p225
aVI have a tendency not to be.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd thirdly, he's as extroverted a person as you could find.
p230
aVI am seriously introverted.
p231
aVI overload so much,
p232
aVI can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon
p233
aVand expect to sleep in the evening.
p234
aa(lp235
VWe had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael.
p236
aVAnd Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt.
p237
aVSo the person who seconded him asked Tom and me,
p238
aV"What do you make of Michael?"
p239
aVWell, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute.
p240
aVHe spoke in classic "extrovert-ese."
p241
aVAnd here is how extroverted ears heard what I said,
p242
aVwhich is actually pretty accurate.
p243
aVI said, "Well Michael does have a tendency at times
p244
aVof behaving in a way that some of us might see
p245
aVas perhaps more assertive than is normally called for."
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VTom rolled his eyes and he said,
p250
aV"Brian, that's what I said:
p251
aVhe's an asshole!"
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
V(Applause)
p256
aa(lp257
VNow, as an introvert,
p258
aVI might gently allude to certain "assholic" qualities
p259
aVin this man's behavior,
p260
aVbut I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VBut the extrovert says,
p265
aV"If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."
p266
aVAnd we go past each other.
p267
aa(lp268
VNow is this something that we should be heedful of?
p269
aVOf course.
p270
aVIt's important that we know this.
p271
aVIs that all we are?
p272
aVAre we just a bunch of traits?
p273
aVNo, we're not.
p274
aVRemember, you're like some other people
p275
aVand like no other person.
p276
aVHow about that idiosyncratic you?
p277
aVAs Elizabeth or as George,
p278
aVyou may share your extroversion or your neuroticism.
p279
aVBut are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior,
p280
aVor Georgian of yours,
p281
aVthat make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits?
p282
aVThat make us love you?
p283
aVNot just because you're a certain type of person.
p284
aa(lp285
VI'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes.
p286
aVI don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes.
p287
aVSo what is it that makes us different?
p288
aVIt's the doings that we have in our life \u2014 the personal projects.
p289
aVYou have a personal project right now,
p290
aVbut nobody may know it here.
p291
aVIt relates to your kid \u2014
p292
aVyou've been back three times to the hospital,
p293
aVand they still don't know what's wrong.
p294
aVOr it could be your mom.
p295
aVAnd you'd been acting out of character.
p296
aVThese are free traits.
p297
aVYou're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably
p298
aVin order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor
p299
aVin the hospital,
p300
aVto get something for your mom or your child.
p301
aa(lp302
VWhat are these free traits?
p303
aVThey're where we enact a script
p304
aVin order to advance a core project in our lives.
p305
aVAnd they are what matters.
p306
aVDon't ask people what type you are;
p307
aVask them, "What are your core projects in your life?"
p308
aVAnd we enact those free traits.
p309
aVI'm an introvert,
p310
aVbut I have a core project, which is to profess.
p311
aVI'm a professor.
p312
aVAnd I adore my students,
p313
aVand I adore my field.
p314
aVAnd I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's exciting,
p315
aVwhat I can't wait to tell them about.
p316
aVAnd so I act in an extroverted way,
p317
aVbecause at eight in the morning,
p318
aVthe students need a little bit of humor,
p319
aVa little bit of engagement to keep them going
p320
aVin arduous days of study.
p321
aa(lp322
VBut we need to be very careful
p323
aVwhen we act protractedly out of character.
p324
aVSometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves.
p325
aVI find, for example, after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior,
p326
aVI need to repair somewhere on my own.
p327
aVAs Susan Cain said in her "Quiet" book,
p328
aVin a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor
p329
aVwho was teaching at the time at Harvard,
p330
aVI sometimes go to the men's room
p331
aVto escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VI remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle,
p336
aVtrying to avoid overstimulation.
p337
aVAnd a real extrovert came in beside me \u2014 not right in my cubicle,
p338
aVbut in the next cubicle over \u2014
p339
aVand I could hear various evacuatory noises,
p340
aVwhich we hate \u2014 even our own,
p341
aVthat's why we flush during as well as after.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd then I heard this gravelly voice saying,
p346
aV"Hey, is that Dr. Little?"
p347
aa(lp348
V(Laughter)
p349
aa(lp350
VIf anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months,
p351
aVit's talking on the john.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VThat's where I'm going now.
p356
aVDon't follow me.
p357
aa(lp358
VThank you.

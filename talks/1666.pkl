VWhen I was 11,
p5
aVI remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.
p6
aVMy father was listening to BBC News
p7
aVon his small, gray radio.
p8
aVThere was a big smile on his face which was unusual then,
p9
aVbecause the news mostly depressed him.
p10
aa(lp11
V"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted.
p12
aa(lp13
VI didn't know what it meant,
p14
aVbut I could see that my father was very, very happy.
p15
aa(lp16
V"You can go to a real school now," he said.
p17
aa(lp18
VA morning that I will never forget.
p19
aVA real school.
p20
aVYou see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan
p21
aVand made it illegal for girls to go to school.
p22
aVSo for the next five years, I dressed as a boy
p23
aVto escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed
p24
aVto be outside alone, to a secret school.
p25
aVIt was the only way we both could be educated.
p26
aVEach day, we took a different route
p27
aVso that no one would suspect where we were going.
p28
aVWe would cover our books in grocery bags
p29
aVso it would seem we were just out shopping.
p30
aVThe school was in a house,
p31
aVmore than 100 of us packed in one small living room.
p32
aVIt was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.
p33
aVWe all knew we were risking our lives \u2014
p34
aVthe teacher, the students and our parents.
p35
aVFrom time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled
p36
aVfor a week because Taliban were suspicious.
p37
aVWe always wondered what they knew about us.
p38
aVWere we being followed?
p39
aVDo they know where we live?
p40
aVWe were scared,
p41
aVbut still, school was where we wanted to be.
p42
aa(lp43
VI was very lucky to grow up in a family
p44
aVwhere education was prized and daughters were treasured.
p45
aVMy grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
p46
aVA total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan,
p47
aVhe insisted that his daughter, my mom,
p48
aVgo to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.
p49
aVBut my educated mother became a teacher.
p50
aVThere she is.
p51
aVShe retired two years ago, only to turn our house
p52
aVinto a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
p53
aVAnd my father \u2014 that's him \u2014
p54
aVhe was the first ever in his family to receive an education.
p55
aVThere was no question that his children
p56
aVwould receive an education, including his daughters,
p57
aVdespite the Taliban, despite the risks.
p58
aVTo him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.
p59
aVDuring Taliban years, I remember
p60
aVthere were times I would get so frustrated by our life
p61
aVand always being scared and not seeing a future.
p62
aVI would want to quit,
p63
aVbut my father,
p64
aVhe would say,
p65
aV"Listen, my daughter,
p66
aVyou can lose everything you own in your life.
p67
aVYour money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war.
p68
aVBut the one thing that will always remain with you
p69
aVis what is here,
p70
aVand if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees,
p71
aVwe will.
p72
aVSo do you still not want to continue?"
p73
aa(lp74
VToday I am 22.
p75
aVI was raised in a country that has been destroyed
p76
aVby decades of war.
p77
aVFewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school,
p78
aVand had my family not been so committed to my education,
p79
aVI would be one of them.
p80
aVInstead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Applause)
p83
aa(lp84
VWhen I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather,
p85
aVthe one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters,
p86
aVwas among the first to congratulate me.
p87
aVHe not only brags about my college degree,
p88
aVbut also that I was the first woman,
p89
aVand that I am the first woman
p90
aVto drive him through the streets of Kabul.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VMy family believes in me.
p95
aVI dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.
p96
aVThat's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10,
p97
aVa global campaign to educate women.
p98
aVThat's why I cofounded SOLA,
p99
aVthe first and perhaps only boarding school
p100
aVfor girls in Afghanistan,
p101
aVa country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
p102
aVThe exciting thing is that I see students at my school
p103
aVwith ambition grabbing at opportunity.
p104
aVAnd I see their parents and their fathers
p105
aVwho, like my own, advocate for them,
p106
aVdespite and even in the face of daunting opposition.
p107
aa(lp108
VLike Ahmed. That's not his real name,
p109
aVand I cannot show you his face,
p110
aVbut Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
p111
aVLess than a month ago, he and his daughter
p112
aVwere on their way from SOLA to their village,
p113
aVand they literally missed being killed
p114
aVby a roadside bomb by minutes.
p115
aVAs he arrived home, the phone rang,
p116
aVa voice warning him
p117
aVthat if he sent his daughter back to school,
p118
aVthey would try again.
p119
aa(lp120
V"Kill me now, if you wish," he said,
p121
aV"but I will not ruin my daughter's future
p122
aVbecause of your old and backward ideas."
p123
aa(lp124
VWhat I've come to realize about Afghanistan,
p125
aVand this is something that is often dismissed in the West,
p126
aVthat behind most of us who succeed
p127
aVis a father who recognizes the value in his daughter
p128
aVand who sees that her success is his success.
p129
aVIt's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.
p130
aVIn fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators
p131
aVof a bright future for their daughters,
p132
aVbut in the context of a society like in Afghanistan,
p133
aVwe must have the support of men.
p134
aVUnder the Taliban, girls who went to school
p135
aVnumbered in the hundreds \u2014
p136
aVremember, it was illegal.
p137
aVBut today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Applause)
p140
aa(lp141
VAfghanistan looks so different from here in America.
p142
aVI find that Americans see the fragility in changes.
p143
aVI fear that these changes will not last
p144
aVmuch beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.
p145
aVBut when I am back in Afghanistan,
p146
aVwhen I see the students in my school
p147
aVand their parents who advocate for them,
p148
aVwho encourage them, I see a promising future
p149
aVand lasting change.
p150
aVTo me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities,
p151
aVand every single day
p152
aVthe girls of SOLA remind me of that.
p153
aVLike me, they are dreaming big.
p154
aa(lp155
VThank you.

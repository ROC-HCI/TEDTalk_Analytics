VI'll never forget that day
p5
aVback in the spring of 2006.
p6
aVI was a surgical resident
p7
aVat The Johns Hopkins Hospital,
p8
aVtaking emergency call.
p9
aVI got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning
p10
aVto come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer
p11
aVon her foot.
p12
aVI can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh
p13
aVas I pulled the curtain back to see her.
p14
aVAnd everybody there agreed this woman was very sick
p15
aVand she needed to be in the hospital.
p16
aVThat wasn't being asked.
p17
aVThe question that was being asked of me was a different one,
p18
aVwhich was, did she also need an amputation?
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, looking back on that night,
p21
aVI'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman
p22
aVon that night with the same empathy and compassion
p23
aVI'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed
p24
aVwho came to the E.R. three nights earlier
p25
aVwith lower back pain
p26
aVthat turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.
p27
aVIn her case, I knew there was nothing I could do
p28
aVthat was actually going to save her life.
p29
aVThe cancer was too advanced.
p30
aVBut I was committed to making sure that
p31
aVI could do anything possible to make her stay
p32
aVmore comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket
p33
aVand a cup of a coffee.
p34
aVI brought some for her parents.
p35
aVBut more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her,
p36
aVbecause obviously she had done nothing
p37
aVto bring this on herself.
p38
aVSo why was it that, just a few nights later,
p39
aVas I stood in that same E.R. and determined
p40
aVthat my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation,
p41
aVwhy did I hold her in such bitter contempt?
p42
aa(lp43
VYou see, unlike the woman the night before,
p44
aVthis woman had type 2 diabetes.
p45
aVShe was fat.
p46
aVAnd we all know that's from eating too much
p47
aVand not exercising enough, right?
p48
aVI mean, how hard can it be?
p49
aVAs I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself,
p50
aVif you just tried caring even a little bit,
p51
aVyou wouldn't be in this situation at this moment
p52
aVwith some doctor you've never met
p53
aVabout to amputate your foot.
p54
aa(lp55
VWhy did I feel justified in judging her?
p56
aVI'd like to say I don't know.
p57
aVBut I actually do.
p58
aVYou see, in the hubris of my youth,
p59
aVI thought I had her all figured out.
p60
aVShe ate too much. She got unlucky.
p61
aVShe got diabetes. Case closed.
p62
aa(lp63
VIronically, at that time in my life,
p64
aVI was also doing cancer research,
p65
aVimmune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific,
p66
aVand in that world I was actually taught to question everything,
p67
aVto challenge all assumptions
p68
aVand hold them to the highest possible scientific standards.
p69
aVYet when it came to a disease like diabetes
p70
aVthat kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma,
p71
aVI never once questioned the conventional wisdom.
p72
aVI actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events
p73
aVwas settled science.
p74
aa(lp75
VThree years later, I found out how wrong I was.
p76
aVBut this time, I was the patient.
p77
aVDespite exercising three or four hours every single day,
p78
aVand following the food pyramid to the letter,
p79
aVI'd gained a lot of weight and developed something
p80
aVcalled metabolic syndrome.
p81
aVSome of you may have heard of this.
p82
aVI had become insulin-resistant.
p83
aa(lp84
VYou can think of insulin as this master hormone
p85
aVthat controls what our body does with the foods we eat,
p86
aVwhether we burn it or store it.
p87
aVThis is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.
p88
aVNow failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.
p89
aVAnd insulin resistance, as its name suggests,
p90
aVis when your cells get increasingly resistant
p91
aVto the effect of insulin trying to do its job.
p92
aVOnce you're insulin-resistant,
p93
aVyou're on your way to getting diabetes,
p94
aVwhich is what happens when your pancreas
p95
aVcan't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.
p96
aVNow your blood sugar levels start to rise,
p97
aVand an entire cascade of pathologic events
p98
aVsort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease,
p99
aVcancer, even Alzheimer's disease,
p100
aVand amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.
p101
aa(lp102
VWith that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically,
p103
aVadding and subtracting things most of you would find
p104
aValmost assuredly shocking.
p105
aVI did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less.
p106
aVI, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.
p107
aVMore importantly, I don't have insulin resistance.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut most important, I was left
p110
aVwith these three burning questions that wouldn't go away:
p111
aVHow did this happen to me if I was supposedly
p112
aVdoing everything right?
p113
aVIf the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me,
p114
aVwas it possible it was failing someone else?
p115
aVAnd underlying these questions,
p116
aVI became almost maniacally obsessed
p117
aVin trying to understand the real relationship
p118
aVbetween obesity and insulin resistance.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, most researchers believe obesity
p121
aVis the cause of insulin resistance.
p122
aVLogically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance,
p123
aVyou get people to lose weight, right?
p124
aVYou treat the obesity.
p125
aVBut what if we have it backwards?
p126
aVWhat if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?
p127
aVIn fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem,
p128
aVthe tip of a proverbial iceberg?
p129
aVI know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst
p130
aVof an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.
p131
aVWhat if obesity is a coping mechanism
p132
aVfor a far more sinister problem going on
p133
aVunderneath the cell?
p134
aVI'm not suggesting that obesity is benign,
p135
aVbut what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser
p136
aVof two metabolic evils.
p137
aa(lp138
VYou can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity
p139
aVof our cells to partition fuel,
p140
aVas I alluded to a moment ago,
p141
aVtaking those calories that we take in
p142
aVand burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.
p143
aVWhen we become insulin-resistant,
p144
aVthe homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.
p145
aVSo now, when insulin says to a cell,
p146
aVI want you to burn more energy
p147
aVthan the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says,
p148
aV"No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."
p149
aVAnd because fat cells are actually missing most of
p150
aVthe complex cellular machinery found in other cells,
p151
aVit's probably the safest place to store it.
p152
aVSo for many of us, about 75 million Americans,
p153
aVthe appropriate response to insulin resistance
p154
aVmay actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse,
p155
aVgetting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.
p156
aa(lp157
VThis is a really subtle distinction,
p158
aVbut the implication could be profound.
p159
aVConsider the following analogy:
p160
aVThink of the bruise you get on your shin
p161
aVwhen you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.
p162
aVSure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly
p163
aVdon't like the discolored look, but we all know
p164
aVthe bruise per Se is not the problem.
p165
aVIn fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma,
p166
aVall of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury
p167
aVto salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread
p168
aVof infection to elsewhere in the body.
p169
aVNow, imagine we thought bruises were the problem,
p170
aVand we evolved a giant medical establishment
p171
aVand a culture around treating bruises:
p172
aVmasking creams, painkillers, you name it,
p173
aVall the while ignoring the fact that people
p174
aVare still banging their shins into coffee tables.
p175
aVHow much better would we be if we treated the cause \u2014
p176
aVtelling people to pay attention
p177
aVwhen they walk through the living room \u2014
p178
aVrather than the effect?
p179
aVGetting the cause and the effect right
p180
aVmakes all the difference in the world.
p181
aVGetting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry
p182
aVcan still do very well for its shareholders
p183
aVbut nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.
p184
aVCause and effect.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo what I'm suggesting is
p187
aVmaybe we have the cause and effect wrong
p188
aVon obesity and insulin resistance.
p189
aVMaybe we should be asking ourselves,
p190
aVis it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain
p191
aVand the diseases associated with obesity,
p192
aVat least in most people?
p193
aVWhat if being obese is just a metabolic response
p194
aVto something much more threatening,
p195
aVan underlying epidemic,
p196
aVthe one we ought to be worried about?
p197
aa(lp198
VLet's look at some suggestive facts.
p199
aVWe know that 30 million obese Americans
p200
aVin the United States don't have insulin resistance.
p201
aVAnd by the way, they don't appear to be at any
p202
aVgreater risk of disease than lean people.
p203
aVConversely, we know that six million lean people
p204
aVin the United States are insulin-resistant,
p205
aVand by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk
p206
aVfor those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago
p207
aVthan their obese counterparts.
p208
aVNow I don't know why, but it might be because,
p209
aVin their case, their cells haven't actually figured out
p210
aVthe right thing to do with that excess energy.
p211
aVSo if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance,
p212
aVand you can be lean and have it,
p213
aVthis suggests that obesity may just be a proxy
p214
aVfor what's going on.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo what if we're fighting the wrong war,
p217
aVfighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?
p218
aVEven worse, what if blaming the obese
p219
aVmeans we're blaming the victims?
p220
aVWhat if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity
p221
aVare just wrong?
p222
aa(lp223
VPersonally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore,
p224
aVlet alone the luxury of certainty.
p225
aVI have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this,
p226
aVbut I'm wide open to others.
p227
aVNow, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me,
p228
aVis this.
p229
aVIf you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from
p230
aVwhen it becomes insulin resistant,
p231
aVthe answer probably isn't too much food.
p232
aVIt's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.
p233
aVNow, we know that refined grains and starches
p234
aVelevate your blood sugar in the short run,
p235
aVand there's even reason to believe that sugar
p236
aVmay lead to insulin resistance directly.
p237
aVSo if you put these physiological processes to work,
p238
aVI'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake
p239
aVof refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving
p240
aVthis epidemic of obesity and diabetes,
p241
aVbut through insulin resistance,
p242
aVyou see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising.
p243
aa(lp244
VWhen I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago,
p245
aVI did it simply by restricting those things,
p246
aVwhich admittedly suggests I have a bias
p247
aVbased on my personal experience.
p248
aVBut that doesn't mean my bias is wrong,
p249
aVand most important, all of this can be tested scientifically.
p250
aVBut step one is accepting the possibility
p251
aVthat our current beliefs about obesity,
p252
aVdiabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong
p253
aVand therefore must be tested.
p254
aVI'm betting my career on this.
p255
aVToday, I devote all of my time to working on this problem,
p256
aVand I'll go wherever the science takes me.
p257
aVI've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore
p258
aVis pretend I have the answers when I don't.
p259
aVI've been humbled enough by all I don't know.
p260
aa(lp261
VFor the past year, I've been fortunate enough
p262
aVto work on this problem with the most amazing team
p263
aVof diabetes and obesity researchers in the country,
p264
aVand the best part is,
p265
aVjust like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals,
p266
aVwe've done the same thing.
p267
aVWe've recruited a team of scientific rivals,
p268
aVthe best and brightest who all have different hypotheses
p269
aVfor what's at the heart of this epidemic.
p270
aVSome think it's too many calories consumed.
p271
aVOthers think it's too much dietary fat.
p272
aVOthers think it's too many refined grains and starches.
p273
aVBut this team of multi-disciplinary,
p274
aVhighly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers
p275
aVdo agree on two things.
p276
aVFirst, this problem is just simply too important
p277
aVto continue ignoring because we think we know the answer.
p278
aVAnd two, if we're willing to be wrong,
p279
aVif we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom
p280
aVwith the best experiments science can offer,
p281
aVwe can solve this problem.
p282
aa(lp283
VI know it's tempting to want an answer right now,
p284
aVsome form of action or policy, some dietary prescription \u2014
p285
aVeat this, not that \u2014
p286
aVbut if we want to get it right,
p287
aVwe're going to have to do much more rigorous science
p288
aVbefore we can write that prescription.
p289
aa(lp290
VBriefly, to address this, our research program
p291
aVis focused around three meta-themes, or questions.
p292
aVFirst, how do the various foods we consume
p293
aVimpact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes,
p294
aVand through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?
p295
aVSecond, based on these insights,
p296
aVcan people make the necessary changes in their diets
p297
aVin a way that's safe and practical to implement?
p298
aVAnd finally, once we identify what safe
p299
aVand practical changes people can make to their diet,
p300
aVhow can we move their behavior in that direction
p301
aVso that it becomes more the default
p302
aVrather than the exception?
p303
aVJust because you know what to do doesn't mean
p304
aVyou're always going to do it.
p305
aVSometimes we have to put cues around people
p306
aVto make it easier, and believe it or not,
p307
aVthat can be studied scientifically.
p308
aa(lp309
VI don't know how this journey is going to end,
p310
aVbut this much seems clear to me, at least:
p311
aVWe can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients
p312
aVlike I did.
p313
aVMost of them actually want to do the right thing,
p314
aVbut they have to know what that is,
p315
aVand it's got to work.
p316
aVI dream of a day when our patients can
p317
aVshed their excess pounds
p318
aVand cure themselves of insulin resistance,
p319
aVbecause as medical professionals,
p320
aVwe've shed our excess mental baggage
p321
aVand cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently
p322
aVto go back to our original ideals:
p323
aVopen minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas
p324
aVwhen they don't appear to be working,
p325
aVand the understanding that scientific truth isn't final,
p326
aVbut constantly evolving.
p327
aVStaying true to that path will be better for our patients
p328
aVand better for science.
p329
aVIf obesity is nothing more than a proxy
p330
aVfor metabolic illness,
p331
aVwhat good does it do us to punish those with the proxy?
p332
aa(lp333
VSometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.
p334
aVseven years ago.
p335
aVI wish I could speak with that woman again.
p336
aVI'd like to tell her how sorry I am.
p337
aVI'd say, as a doctor, I delivered
p338
aVthe best clinical care I could,
p339
aVbut as a human being,
p340
aVI let you down.
p341
aVYou didn't need my judgment and my contempt.
p342
aVYou needed my empathy and compassion,
p343
aVand above all else, you needed a doctor
p344
aVwho was willing to consider
p345
aVmaybe you didn't let the system down.
p346
aVMaybe the system, of which I was a part,
p347
aVwas letting you down.
p348
aVIf you're watching this now,
p349
aVI hope you can forgive me.

While he was studying mechanical engineering as an undergrad, a personal experience led him to discover his passion for medicine. He enrolled at Stanford Medical School, and went on to a residency in general surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital and a post-doctoral fellowship at the National Cancer Institute. After his residency, he joined the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company, where he worked on healthcare and financial system problems.

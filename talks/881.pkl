VChris Anderson: We're having a debate.
p5
aVThe debate is over the proposition:
p6
aV"What the world needs now
p7
aVis nuclear energy." True or false?
p8
aVAnd before we have the debate,
p9
aVI'd like to actually take a show of hands \u2014
p10
aVon balance, right now, are you for or against this?
p11
aVSo those who are "yes," raise your hand. "For."
p12
aVOkay, hands down.
p13
aVThose who are against, raise your hands.
p14
aVOkay, I'm reading that at about
p15
aV75 to 25 in favor at the start.
p16
aVWhich means we're going to take a vote at the end
p17
aVand see how that shifts, if at all.
p18
aVSo here's the format: They're going to have six minutes each,
p19
aVand then after one little, quick exchange between them,
p20
aVI want two people on each side of this debate in the audience
p21
aVto have 30 seconds
p22
aVto make one short, crisp, pungent, powerful point.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo, in favor of the proposition, possibly shockingly,
p25
aVis one of, truly, the founders of the
p26
aVenvironmental movement,
p27
aVa long-standing TEDster, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog,
p28
aVsomeone we all know and love, Stewart Brand.
p29
aa(lp30
VStewart Brand: Whoa.
p31
aV(Applause)
p32
aVThe saying is that with climate, those who know the most
p33
aVare the most worried.
p34
aVWith nuclear, those who know the most
p35
aVare the least worried.
p36
aVA classic example is James Hansen,
p37
aVa NASA climatologist
p38
aVpushing for 350 parts per million
p39
aVcarbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
p40
aVHe came out with a wonderful book recently
p41
aVcalled "Storms of My Grandchildren."
p42
aVAnd Hansen is hard over for nuclear power,
p43
aVas are most climatologists
p44
aVwho are engaging this issue seriously.
p45
aa(lp46
VThis is the design situation:
p47
aVa planet that is facing climate change
p48
aVand is now half urban.
p49
aVLook at the client base for this.
p50
aVFive out of six of us
p51
aVlive in the developing world.
p52
aVWe are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world.
p53
aVAnd we are educating our kids,
p54
aVhaving fewer kids,
p55
aVbasically good news all around.
p56
aVBut we move to cities, toward the bright lights,
p57
aVand one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs,
p58
aVis electricity.
p59
aVAnd if it isn't easily gotten, we'll go ahead and steal it.
p60
aVThis is one of the most desired things
p61
aVby poor people all over the world,
p62
aVin the cities and in the countryside.
p63
aVElectricity for cities, at its best,
p64
aVis what's called baseload electricity.
p65
aVThat's where it is on
p66
aVall the time.
p67
aVAnd so far there are only three major sources of that \u2014
p68
aVcoal and gas, hydro-electric,
p69
aVwhich in most places is maxed-out \u2014
p70
aVand nuclear.
p71
aVI would love to have something in the fourth place here,
p72
aVbut in terms of constant, clean,
p73
aVscalable energy,
p74
aV[solar] and wind and the other renewables
p75
aVaren't there yet because they're inconstant.
p76
aVNuclear is and has been for 40 years.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, from an environmental standpoint,
p79
aVthe main thing you want to look at
p80
aVis what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal,
p81
aVthe two major sources of electricity.
p82
aVIf all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear,
p83
aVthe waste from that lifetime of electricity
p84
aVwould go in a Coke can \u2014
p85
aVa pretty heavy Coke can, about two pounds.
p86
aVBut one day of coal
p87
aVadds up to one hell of a lot
p88
aVof carbon dioxide
p89
aVin a normal one-gigawatt coal-fired plant.
p90
aVThen what happens to the waste?
p91
aVThe nuclear waste typically goes into
p92
aVa dry cask storage
p93
aVout back of the parking lot at the reactor site
p94
aVbecause most places don't have underground storage yet.
p95
aVIt's just as well, because it can stay where it is.
p96
aVWhile the carbon dioxide,
p97
aVvast quantities of it, gigatons,
p98
aVgoes into the atmosphere
p99
aVwhere we can't get it back \u2014 yet \u2014
p100
aVand where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about.
p101
aVSo when you add up the greenhouse gases
p102
aVin the lifetime of these various energy sources,
p103
aVnuclear is down there with wind and hydro,
p104
aVbelow solar and way below, obviously, all the fossil fuels.
p105
aa(lp106
VWind is wonderful; I love wind.
p107
aVI love being around these
p108
aVbig wind generators.
p109
aVBut one of the things we're discovering is that
p110
aVwind, like solar, is an actually relatively
p111
aVdilute source of energy.
p112
aVAnd so it takes a very large footprint on the land,
p113
aVa very large footprint in terms of materials,
p114
aVfive to 10 times what you'd use for nuclear,
p115
aVand typically to get one gigawatt of electricity
p116
aVis on the order of 250 square miles
p117
aVof wind farm.
p118
aVIn places like Denmark and Germany,
p119
aVthey've maxed out on wind already.
p120
aVThey've run out of good sites.
p121
aVThe power lines are getting overloaded.
p122
aVAnd you peak out.
p123
aVLikewise, with solar,
p124
aVespecially here in California,
p125
aVwe're discovering that the 80 solar farm
p126
aVschemes that are going forward
p127
aVwant to basically bulldoze
p128
aV1,000 square miles of southern California desert.
p129
aVWell, as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen.
p130
aVIt's okay on frapped-out agricultural land.
p131
aVSolar's wonderful on rooftops.
p132
aVBut out in the landscape,
p133
aVone gigawatt is on the order of 50 square miles
p134
aVof bulldozed desert.
p135
aa(lp136
VWhen you add all these things up \u2014
p137
aVSaul Griffith did the numbers and figured out
p138
aVwhat would it take
p139
aVto get 13 clean
p140
aVterawatts of energy
p141
aVfrom wind, solar and biofuels,
p142
aVand that area would be roughly the size of the United States,
p143
aVan area he refers to as "Renewistan."
p144
aVA guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay,
p145
aVa physicist in England,
p146
aVand in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things,
p147
aVhe says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic."
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VIn terms of weapons,
p152
aVthe best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy.
p153
aVWe have been taking down
p154
aVthe Russian warheads,
p155
aVturning it into electricity.
p156
aVTen percent of American electricity
p157
aVcomes from decommissioned warheads.
p158
aVWe haven't even started the American stockpile.
p159
aVI think of most interest to a TED audience
p160
aVwould be the new generation of reactors
p161
aVthat are very small,
p162
aVdown around 10
p163
aVto 125 megawatts.
p164
aVThis is one from Toshiba.
p165
aVHere's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge.
p166
aVAnd that would be very interesting in the developing world.
p167
aVTypically, these things are put in the ground.
p168
aVThey're referred to as nuclear batteries.
p169
aVThey're incredibly safe,
p170
aVweapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it.
p171
aVHere is a commercial version from New Mexico
p172
aVcalled the Hyperion,
p173
aVand another one from Oregon called NuScale.
p174
aVBabcock & Wilcox that make nuclear reactors,
p175
aVhere's an integral fast reactor.
p176
aVThorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in.
p177
aVThe governments of the world are going to have to decide
p178
aVthat coals need to be made expensive, and these will go ahead.
p179
aVAnd here's the future.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VCA: Okay. Okay.
p184
aV(Applause)
p185
aVSo arguing against,
p186
aVa man who's been at the nitty, gritty heart
p187
aVof the energy debate and the climate change debate for years.
p188
aVIn 2000, he discovered that soot
p189
aVwas probably the second leading cause of global warming, after CO2.
p190
aVHis team have been making detailed calculations
p191
aVof the relative impacts
p192
aVof different energy sources.
p193
aVHis first time at TED, possibly a disadvantage \u2014 we shall see \u2014
p194
aVfrom Stanford,
p195
aVProfessor Mark Jacobson. Good luck.
p196
aa(lp197
VMark Jacobson: Thank you.
p198
aV(Applause)
p199
aVSo my premise here is that nuclear energy
p200
aVputs out more carbon dioxide,
p201
aVputs out more air pollutants,
p202
aVenhances mortality more and takes longer to put up
p203
aVthan real renewable energy systems,
p204
aVnamely wind, solar,
p205
aVgeothermal power, hydro-tidal wave power.
p206
aVAnd it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation.
p207
aVSo let's start just by looking at the
p208
aVCO2 emissions from the life cycle.
p209
aVCO2e emissions are equivalent emissions
p210
aVof all the greenhouse gases and particles
p211
aVthat cause warming
p212
aVand converted to CO2.
p213
aVAnd if you look, wind and concentrated solar
p214
aVhave the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph.
p215
aVNuclear \u2014 there are two bars here.
p216
aVOne is a low estimate, and one is a high estimate.
p217
aVThe low estimate is the nuclear energy industry
p218
aVestimate of nuclear.
p219
aVThe high is the average of 103
p220
aVscientific, peer-reviewed studies.
p221
aVAnd this is just the
p222
aVCO2 from the life cycle.
p223
aa(lp224
VIf we look at the delays,
p225
aVit takes between 10 and 19 years
p226
aVto put up a nuclear power plant
p227
aVfrom planning to operation.
p228
aVThis includes about three and a half to six years
p229
aVfor a site permit.
p230
aVand another two and a half to four years
p231
aVfor a construction permit and issue,
p232
aVand then four to nine years for actual construction.
p233
aVAnd in China, right now,
p234
aVthey're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear.
p235
aVAnd the average, just for the construction time of these,
p236
aVis 7.1 years
p237
aVon top of any planning times.
p238
aVWhile you're waiting around for your nuclear,
p239
aVyou have to run the regular electric power grid,
p240
aVwhich is mostly coal in the United States and around the world.
p241
aVAnd the chart here shows the difference between
p242
aVthe emissions from the regular grid,
p243
aVresulting if you use nuclear, or anything else,
p244
aVversus wind, CSP or photovoltaics.
p245
aVWind takes about two to five years on average,
p246
aVsame as concentrated solar and photovoltaics.
p247
aVSo the difference is the opportunity cost
p248
aVof using nuclear versus wind, or something else.
p249
aVSo if you add these two together, alone,
p250
aVyou can see a separation
p251
aVthat nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times
p252
aVmore CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy.
p253
aVAnd this doesn't even account
p254
aVfor the footprint on the ground.
p255
aa(lp256
VIf you look at the air pollution health effects,
p257
aVthis is the number of deaths per year in 2020
p258
aVjust from vehicle exhaust.
p259
aVLet's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States
p260
aVto battery electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
p261
aVor flex fuel vehicles run on E85.
p262
aVWell, right now in the United States,
p263
aV50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution,
p264
aVand vehicles are about 25,000 of those.
p265
aVIn 2020, the number will go down to 15,000
p266
aVdue to improvements.
p267
aVAnd so, on the right, you see gasoline emissions,
p268
aVthe death rates of 2020.
p269
aVIf you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol,
p270
aVyou'd actually increase the death rate slightly.
p271
aVIf you go to nuclear,
p272
aVyou do get a big reduction,
p273
aVbut it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow if you consider the fact
p276
aVthat nuclear weapons proliferation
p277
aVis associated with nuclear energy proliferation,
p278
aVbecause we know for example,
p279
aVIndia and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly
p280
aVby enriching uranium
p281
aVin nuclear energy facilities.
p282
aVNorth Korea did that to some extent.
p283
aVIran is doing that right now.
p284
aVAnd Venezuela would be doing it
p285
aVif they started with their nuclear energy facilities.
p286
aVIf you do a large scale expansion
p287
aVof nuclear energy across the world,
p288
aVand as a result there was just one
p289
aVnuclear bomb created
p290
aVthat was used to destroy a city
p291
aVsuch as Mumbai or some other big city, megacity,
p292
aVthe additional death rates due to this
p293
aVaveraged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the U.S.
p294
aVwould be this.
p295
aVSo, do we need this?
p296
aa(lp297
VThe next thing is: What about the footprint? Stewart mentioned the footprint.
p298
aVActually, the footprint on the ground for wind
p299
aVis by far the smallest of any energy source in the world.
p300
aVThat, because the footprint, as you can see,
p301
aVis just the pole touching the ground.
p302
aVAnd you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet
p303
aVwith 73,000 to 145,000
p304
aVfive-megawatt wind turbines.
p305
aVThat would take between one and three square kilometers
p306
aVof footprint on the ground, entirely.
p307
aVThe spacing is something else.
p308
aVThat's the footprint that is always being confused.
p309
aVPeople confuse footprint with spacing.
p310
aVAs you can see from these pictures,
p311
aVthe spacing between can be used for multiple purposes
p312
aVincluding agricultural land,
p313
aVrange land or open space.
p314
aVOver the ocean, it's not even land.
p315
aVNow if we look at nuclear \u2014 (Laughter)
p316
aVWith nuclear, what do we have?
p317
aVWe have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone
p318
aVthat's 17 square kilometers.
p319
aVAnd you have the uranium mining
p320
aVthat you have to deal with.
p321
aa(lp322
VNow if we go to the area,
p323
aVlots is worse than nuclear or wind.
p324
aVFor example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet,
p325
aVthis is how much land you would need.
p326
aVThat's cellulosic, second generation
p327
aVbiofuels from prairie grass.
p328
aVHere's corn ethanol. It's smaller.
p329
aVThis is based on ranges from data,
p330
aVbut if you look at nuclear,
p331
aVit would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet.
p332
aVFor wind, there's a larger area,
p333
aVbut much smaller footprint.
p334
aVAnd of course, with wind,
p335
aVyou could put it all over the East Coast,
p336
aVoffshore theoretically, or you can split it up.
p337
aVAnd now, if you go back to
p338
aVlooking at geothermal, it's even smaller than both,
p339
aVand solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing,
p340
aVbut it's still pretty small.
p341
aVAnd this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet.
p342
aVTo power the entire world with 50 percent wind,
p343
aVyou would need about one percent of world land.
p344
aa(lp345
VMatching the reliability, base load is actually irrelevant.
p346
aVWe want to match the hour-by-hour power supply.
p347
aVYou can do that by combining renewables.
p348
aVThis is from real data in California,
p349
aVlooking at wind data and solar data.
p350
aVAnd it considers just using existing hydro
p351
aVto match the hour-by-hour power demand.
p352
aVHere are the world wind resources.
p353
aVThere's five to 10 times more wind available worldwide
p354
aVthan we need for all the world.
p355
aVSo then here's the final ranking.
p356
aVAnd one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice:
p357
aVYou can either have wind or nuclear.
p358
aVIf you use wind,
p359
aVyou guarantee ice will last.
p360
aVNuclear, the time lag alone
p361
aVwill allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more.
p362
aVAnd we can guarantee a clean, blue sky
p363
aVor an uncertain future with nuclear power.
p364
aa(lp365
V(Applause)
p366
aa(lp367
VCA: All right.
p368
aVSo while they're having their comebacks on each other \u2014
p369
aVand yours is slightly short because you slightly overran \u2014
p370
aVI need two people from either side.
p371
aVSo if you're for this,
p372
aVif you're for nuclear power, put up two hands.
p373
aVIf you're against, put up one.
p374
aVAnd I want two of each for the mics.
p375
aVNow then, you guys have \u2014
p376
aVyou have a minute comeback on him
p377
aVto pick up a point he said, challenge it,
p378
aVwhatever.
p379
aa(lp380
VSB: I think a point of difference we're having, Mark,
p381
aVhas to do with weapons
p382
aVand energy.
p383
aVThese diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow
p384
aVputting out a lot of greenhouse gases \u2014
p385
aVa lot of those studies include, "Well of course war will be inevitable
p386
aVand therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that,"
p387
aVwhich is kind of finessing it
p388
aVa little bit, I think.
p389
aVThe reality is that there's, what,
p390
aV21 nations that have nuclear power?
p391
aVOf those, seven have nuclear weapons.
p392
aVIn every case, they got the weapons
p393
aVbefore they got the nuclear power.
p394
aVThere are two nations, North Korea and Israel,
p395
aVthat have nuclear weapons
p396
aVand don't have nuclear power at all.
p397
aVThe places that we would most like to have
p398
aVreally clean energy occur
p399
aVare China, India, Europe, North America,
p400
aVall of which have sorted out their situation
p401
aVin relation to nuclear weapons.
p402
aVSo that leaves a couple of places like Iran,
p403
aVmaybe Venezuela,
p404
aVthat you would like to have very close
p405
aVsurveillance of anything
p406
aVthat goes on with fissile stuff.
p407
aVPushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we
p408
aVreally know where all of the fissile material is,
p409
aVand we can move toward
p410
aVzero weapons left, once we know all that.
p411
aa(lp412
VCA: Mark,
p413
aV30 seconds, either on that or on anything Stewart said.
p414
aa(lp415
VMJ: Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first,
p416
aVand then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories.
p417
aVSo the other thing is, we don't need nuclear energy.
p418
aVThere's plenty of solar and wind.
p419
aVYou can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram.
p420
aVThat's from real data.
p421
aVAnd this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science.
p422
aVSolving the world's problems can be done,
p423
aVif you really put your mind to it and use clean, renewable energy.
p424
aVThere's absolutely no need for nuclear power.
p425
aa(lp426
V(Applause)
p427
aa(lp428
VCA: We need someone for.
p429
aVRod Beckstrom: Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom, CEO of ICANN.
p430
aVI've been involved in global warming policy
p431
aVsince 1994,
p432
aVwhen I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund
p433
aVthat was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol.
p434
aVAnd I want to support Stewart Brand's position.
p435
aVI've come around in the last 10 years.
p436
aVI used to be against nuclear power.
p437
aVI'm now supporting Stewart's position,
p438
aVsoftly, from a risk-management standpoint,
p439
aVagreeing that
p440
aVthe risks of overheating the planet
p441
aVoutweigh the risk of nuclear incident,
p442
aVwhich certainly is possible and is a very real problem.
p443
aVHowever, I think there may be a win-win solution here
p444
aVwhere both parties can win this debate,
p445
aVand that is, we face a situation
p446
aVwhere it's carbon caps on this planet
p447
aVor die.
p448
aVAnd in the United States Senate,
p449
aVwe need bipartisan support \u2014
p450
aVonly one or two votes are needed \u2014
p451
aVto move global warming through the Senate,
p452
aVand this room can help.
p453
aVSo if we get that through, then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris.
p454
aa(lp455
VCA: Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against.
p456
aa(lp457
VDavid Fanton: Hi, I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things.
p458
aVThe first is: be aware of the propaganda.
p459
aVThe propaganda from the industry
p460
aVhas been very, very strong.
p461
aVAnd we have not had
p462
aVthe other side of the argument fully aired
p463
aVso that people can draw their own conclusions.
p464
aVBe very aware of the propaganda.
p465
aVSecondly, think about this.
p466
aVIf we build all these nuclear power plants,
p467
aVall that waste
p468
aVis going to be on hundreds, if not thousands,
p469
aVof trucks and trains,
p470
aVmoving through this country every day.
p471
aVTell me they're not going to have accidents.
p472
aVTell me that those accidents aren't going to
p473
aVput material into the environment
p474
aVthat is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years.
p475
aVAnd then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains
p476
aVisn't a potential terrorist target.
p477
aa(lp478
VCA: Thank you.
p479
aVFor.
p480
aVAnyone else for? Go.
p481
aa(lp482
VAlex: Hi, I'm Alex. I just wanted to say,
p483
aVI'm, first of all, renewable energy's biggest fan.
p484
aVI've got solar PV on my roof.
p485
aVI've got a hydro conversion
p486
aVat a watermill that I own.
p487
aVAnd I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff.
p488
aVHowever, there's a basic arithmetic problem here.
p489
aVThe capability of
p490
aVthe sun shining, the wind blowing and the rain falling,
p491
aVsimply isn't enough to add up.
p492
aVSo if we want to keep the lights on,
p493
aVwe actually need a solution
p494
aVwhich is going to keep generating all of the time.
p495
aVI campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s,
p496
aVand I continue to do so now.
p497
aVBut we've got an opportunity
p498
aVto recycle them into something more useful
p499
aVthat enables us to get energy all of the time.
p500
aVAnd, ultimately, the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away.
p501
aVWe're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone.
p502
aVWe need a solution that generates all of the time.
p503
aVIf we're going to keep the lights on,
p504
aVnuclear is that solution.
p505
aa(lp506
VCA: Thank you.
p507
aVAnyone else against?
p508
aa(lp509
VMan: The last person who was in favor made the premise
p510
aVthat we don't have enough
p511
aValternative renewable resources.
p512
aVAnd our "against" proponent up here
p513
aVmade it very clear that we actually do.
p514
aVAnd so the fallacy
p515
aVthat we need this resource
p516
aVand we can actually make it in a time frame
p517
aVthat is meaningful is not possible.
p518
aVI will also add one other thing.
p519
aVRay Kurzweil and all the other talks \u2014
p520
aVwe know that the stick is going up exponentially.
p521
aVSo you can't look at state-of-the-art technologies in renewables
p522
aVand say, "That's all we have."
p523
aVBecause five years from now, it will blow you away
p524
aVwhat we'll actually have as alternatives
p525
aVto this horrible, disastrous nuclear power.
p526
aa(lp527
VCA: Point well made. Thank you.
p528
aa(lp529
V(Applause)
p530
aa(lp531
VSo each of you has really just a couple sentences \u2014
p532
aV30 seconds each
p533
aVto sum up.
p534
aVYour final pitch, Stewart.
p535
aa(lp536
VSB: I loved your "It all balances out" chart
p537
aVthat you had there.
p538
aVIt was a sunny day and a windy night.
p539
aVAnd just now in England
p540
aVthey had a cold spell.
p541
aVAll of the wind in the entire country
p542
aVshut down for a week.
p543
aVNone of those things were stirring.
p544
aVAnd as usual, they had to buy nuclear power from France.
p545
aVTwo gigawatts comes through the Chunnel.
p546
aVThis keeps happening.
p547
aVI used to worry about the 10,000 year factor.
p548
aVAnd the fact is, we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel
p549
aVin the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along.
p550
aVAnd especially the small reactors need to go forward.
p551
aVI heard from Nathan Myhrvold \u2014 and I think here's the action point \u2014
p552
aVit'll take an act of Congress
p553
aVto make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
p554
aVstart moving quickly on these small reactors,
p555
aVwhich we need very much, here and in the world.
p556
aa(lp557
V(Applause)
p558
aa(lp559
VMJ: So we've analyzed the hour-by-hour
p560
aVpower demand and supply,
p561
aVlooking at solar, wind, using data for California.
p562
aVAnd you can match that demand, hour-by-hour,
p563
aVfor the whole year almost.
p564
aVNow, with regard to the resources,
p565
aVwe've developed the first wind map of the world,
p566
aVfrom data alone, at 80 meters.
p567
aVWe know what the wind resources are. You can cover 15 percent.
p568
aVFifteen percent of the entire U.S.
p569
aVhas wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive.
p570
aVAnd there's much more solar than there is wind.
p571
aVThere's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable.
p572
aa(lp573
VCA: Okay. So, thank you, Mark.
p574
aV(Applause)
p575
aVSo if you were in Palm Springs ...
p576
aV(Laughter)
p577
aV(Applause)
p578
aVShameless. Shameless. Shameless.
p579
aV(Applause)
p580
aa(lp581
VSo, people of the TED community,
p582
aVI put it to you that what the world needs now
p583
aVis nuclear energy.
p584
aVAll those in favor, raise your hands.
p585
aV(Shouts)
p586
aVAnd all those against.
p587
aVOoooh.
p588
aVNow that is \u2014 my take on that ...
p589
aVJust put up ... Hands up, people who changed their minds during the debate,
p590
aVwho voted differently.
p591
aVThose of you who changed your mind
p592
aVin favor of "for"
p593
aVput your hands up.
p594
aVOkay. So here's the read on it.
p595
aVBoth people won supporters,
p596
aVbut on my count,
p597
aVthe mood of the TED community shifted
p598
aVfrom about 75 to 25
p599
aVto about 65 to 35
p600
aVin favor, in favor.
p601
aa(lp602
VYou both won. I congratulate both of you.
p603
aVThank you for that.

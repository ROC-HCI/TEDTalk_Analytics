VOur face is hugely important
p5
aVbecause it's the external, visual part
p6
aVthat everybody else sees.
p7
aVLet's not forget it's a functional entity.
p8
aVWe have strong skull bones
p9
aVthat protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.
p10
aVIt's where our senses are located, our special senses \u2014
p11
aVour vision, our speech,
p12
aVour hearing, our smell, our taste.
p13
aVAnd this bone
p14
aVis peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull
p15
aVwith cavities, the sinuses,
p16
aVwhich warm and moisten the air we breathe.
p17
aVBut also imagine if they were filled with solid bone \u2014
p18
aVour head would be dead weight,
p19
aVwe wouldn't be able to hold it erect,
p20
aVwe wouldn't be able to look at the world around us.
p21
aVThis woman is slowly dying
p22
aVbecause the benign tumors in her facial bones
p23
aVhave completely obliterated her mouth and her nose
p24
aVso she can't breathe and eat.
p25
aa(lp26
VAttached to the facial bones
p27
aVthat define our face's structure
p28
aVare the muscles that deliver our facial expression,
p29
aVour universal language of expression,
p30
aVour social-signaling system.
p31
aVAnd overlying this is the skin drape,
p32
aVwhich is a hugely complex
p33
aVthree-dimensional structure \u2014
p34
aVtaking right-angled bends here and there,
p35
aVhaving thin areas like the eyelids,
p36
aVthick areas like the cheek, different colors.
p37
aVAnd then we have the sensual factor of the face.
p38
aVWhere do we like to kiss people?
p39
aVOn the lips. Nibble the ears maybe.
p40
aVIt's the face where we're attracted to with that.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut let's not forget the hair.
p43
aVYou're looking at the image on your left-hand side \u2014
p44
aVthat's my son with his eyebrows present.
p45
aVLook how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing.
p46
aVThere's a definite difference.
p47
aVAnd imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose,
p48
aVhe'd look even odder still.
p49
aa(lp50
VDysmorphophobia
p51
aVis an extreme version
p52
aVof the fact that we don't see ourselves
p53
aVas others see us.
p54
aVIt's a shocking truth
p55
aVthat we only see mirror images of ourselves,
p56
aVand we only see ourselves
p57
aVin freeze-frame photographic images
p58
aVthat capture a mere fraction of the time that we live.
p59
aVDysmorphophobia
p60
aVis a perversion of this
p61
aVwhere people who may be very good looking
p62
aVregard themselves as hideously ugly
p63
aVand are constantly seeking surgery
p64
aVto correct their facial appearance.
p65
aVThey don't need this. They need psychiatric help.
p66
aVMax has kindly donated his photograph to me.
p67
aVHe doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph
p68
aVto illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic.
p69
aVIn other words, he looks entirely normal.
p70
aa(lp71
VAge is another thing
p72
aVwhen our attitude toward our appearance changes.
p73
aVSo children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves,
p74
aVby the behavior of adults around them.
p75
aVHere's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor
p76
aVthat's growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose,
p77
aVand she's having difficulty seeing.
p78
aVAs you can see, it's blocking her vision.
p79
aVShe's also in danger, when she damages this,
p80
aVof bleeding profusely.
p81
aVOur research has shown
p82
aVthat the parents and close loved ones of these children
p83
aVadore them.
p84
aVThey've grown used to their face; they think they're special.
p85
aVActually, sometimes the parents argue
p86
aVabout whether these children should have the lesion removed.
p87
aVAnd occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions
p88
aVbecause the child they've grown to love
p89
aVhas changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them.
p90
aVBut other adults
p91
aVsay incredibly painful things.
p92
aVThey say, "How dare you take this child out of the house
p93
aVand terrify other people.
p94
aVShouldn't you be doing something about this? Why haven't you had it removed?"
p95
aVAnd other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion,
p96
aVbecause \u2014 a natural curiosity.
p97
aVAnd that obviously alerts the child
p98
aVto their unusual nature.
p99
aVAfter surgery, everything normalizes.
p100
aVThe adults behave more naturally,
p101
aVand the children play more readily with other children.
p102
aa(lp103
VAs teenagers \u2014
p104
aVjust think back to your teenage years \u2014
p105
aVwe're going through a dramatic
p106
aVand often disproportionate change
p107
aVin our facial appearance.
p108
aVWe're trying to struggle to find our identity.
p109
aVWe crave the approval of our peers.
p110
aVSo our facial appearance is vital to us
p111
aVas we're trying to project ourselves to the world.
p112
aVJust remember that single acne spot
p113
aVthat crippled you for several days.
p114
aVHow long did you spend looking in the mirror every day,
p115
aVpracticing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look,
p116
aVtrying to look like Sean Connery, as I did,
p117
aVtrying to raise one eyebrow?
p118
aVIt's a crippling time.
p119
aa(lp120
VI've chosen to show this profile view of Sue
p121
aVbecause what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward
p122
aVand her lower lip jutting forward.
p123
aVI'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward.
p124
aVTurn to the person next to you,
p125
aVpush your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you
p126
aVand look at them \u2014 they look miserable.
p127
aVThat's exactly what people used to say to Sue.
p128
aVShe wasn't miserable at all.
p129
aVBut people used to say to her, "Why are you so miserable?"
p130
aVPeople were making misjudgments all the time
p131
aVon her mood.
p132
aVTeachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school.
p133
aVSo she chose to have facial surgery.
p134
aVAfter the facial surgery,
p135
aVshe said, "My face now reflects my personality.
p136
aVPeople know now that I'm enthusiastic,
p137
aVthat I'm a happy person."
p138
aVAnd that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers.
p139
aa(lp140
VIs this change, though, a real change,
p141
aVor is it a figment of the imagination
p142
aVof the patient themselves?
p143
aVWell we studied teenagers' attitudes
p144
aVto photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery.
p145
aVAnd what we found was \u2014
p146
aVwe jumbled up the photographs
p147
aVso they couldn't recognize the before and after \u2014
p148
aVwhat we found was that the patients were regarded
p149
aVas being more attractive after the surgery.
p150
aVWell that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them
p151
aVon honesty, intelligence,
p152
aVfriendliness, violence.
p153
aVThey were all perceived as being
p154
aVless than normal in all those characteristics \u2014
p155
aVmore violent, etc. \u2014 before the surgery.
p156
aVAfter the surgery,
p157
aVthey were perceived as being more intelligent,
p158
aVmore friendly, more honest, less violent \u2014
p159
aVand yet we hadn't operated on their intellect
p160
aVor their character.
p161
aa(lp162
VWhen people get older,
p163
aVthey don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery.
p164
aVTheir presence in the consultation suite
p165
aVis a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
p166
aVWhat happens to them
p167
aVis that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.
p168
aVSo this is a photograph of Henry,
p169
aVtwo weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed
p170
aVfrom the left side of his face \u2014 his cheekbone,
p171
aVhis upper jaw, his eye-socket.
p172
aVHe looks pretty good at this stage.
p173
aVBut over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations,
p174
aVas the disease ravaged his face
p175
aVand destroyed my reconstruction regularly.
p176
aVI learned a huge amount from Henry.
p177
aVHenry taught me
p178
aVthat you can carry on working.
p179
aVHe worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket.
p180
aVHe enjoyed life to the full,
p181
aVand this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job
p182
aVand a caring family
p183
aVand was able to participate socially.
p184
aVHe maintained a calm insouciance.
p185
aVI don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it.
p186
aVThis was something more than that. He ignored it.
p187
aVHe ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life
p188
aVand carried on oblivious to it.
p189
aVAnd that's what these people can do.
p190
aa(lp191
VHenriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well.
p192
aVThis is a man in his 20s
p193
aVwhose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer
p194
aVthat he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on.
p195
aVIt was my longest operation.
p196
aVIt took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon.
p197
aVWe removed all the bones at the right side of his face \u2014
p198
aVhis eye, his nose,
p199
aVthe skull bones, the facial skin \u2014
p200
aVand reconstructed him with tissue from the back.
p201
aVHe continued to work as a psychiatric nurse.
p202
aVHe got married. He had a son called Jeremiah.
p203
aVAnd again, he said,
p204
aV"This painting of me with my son Jeremiah
p205
aVshows me as the successful man that I feel that I am."
p206
aVHis facial disfigurement
p207
aVdid not affect him
p208
aVbecause he had the support of a family;
p209
aVhe had a successful, fulfilling job.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo we've seen that we can change people's faces.
p212
aVBut when we change people's faces,
p213
aVare we changing their identity \u2014
p214
aVfor better or for worse?
p215
aVFor instance,
p216
aVthere are two different types of facial surgery.
p217
aVWe can categorize it like that.
p218
aVWe can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery \u2014
p219
aVlike Sue.
p220
aVWhen they have facial surgery,
p221
aVthey feel their lives have changed
p222
aVbecause other people perceive them
p223
aVas better people.
p224
aVThey don't feel different.
p225
aVThey feel that they've actually gained
p226
aVwhat they never had,
p227
aVthat their face now reflects their personality.
p228
aVAnd actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery
p229
aVand this kind of surgery.
p230
aVBecause you might say, "Well, this type of surgery
p231
aVmight be regarded as cosmetic."
p232
aVIf you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy.
p233
aVThey're trying to achieve difference in their lives.
p234
aVSue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life.
p235
aVShe was just trying to achieve the face
p236
aVthat matched her personality.
p237
aa(lp238
VBut then we have other people
p239
aVwho don't choose to have facial surgery.
p240
aVThey're people who have their face shot off.
p241
aVI'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you.
p242
aVThey have it forced upon them.
p243
aVAnd again, as I told you,
p244
aVif they have a caring family
p245
aVand good work life,
p246
aVthen they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.
p247
aVTheir identity doesn't change.
p248
aa(lp249
VIs this business
p250
aVabout appearance and preoccupation with it
p251
aVa Western phenomenon?
p252
aVMuzetta's family give the lie to this.
p253
aVThis is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London
p254
aVwho's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face,
p255
aVwhich has already made her blind
p256
aVand which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.
p257
aVAfter she had surgery to remove the tumor,
p258
aVher parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress,
p259
aVa pink ribbon in her hair,
p260
aVand they wanted the painting to be shown around the world,
p261
aVdespite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims
p262
aVand the mother wore a full burqa.
p263
aVSo it's not simply a Western phenomenon.
p264
aa(lp265
VWe make judgments on people's faces
p266
aVall the time.
p267
aVIt's been going on since we can think of Lombroso
p268
aVand the way he would define criminal faces.
p269
aVHe said you could see criminal faces,
p270
aVjudging them just on the photographs that were showed.
p271
aVGood-looking people
p272
aVare always judged as being more friendly.
p273
aVWe look at O.J. \u2014
p274
aVhe's a good-looking guy.
p275
aVWe'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly.
p276
aVNow we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer,
p277
aVand actually he's not the good guy.
p278
aVAnd beauty doesn't equate to goodness,
p279
aVand certainly doesn't equate to contentment.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo we've talked about the static face
p282
aVand judging the static face,
p283
aVbut actually, we're more comfortable
p284
aVwith judging the moving face.
p285
aVWe think we can judge people on their expressions.
p286
aVU.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system
p287
aVlike to see a live witness
p288
aVto see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity \u2014
p289
aVthe blink, the hesitation.
p290
aVAnd so they want to see live witnesses.
p291
aVTodorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second,
p292
aVwe can make a judgment on somebody's face.
p293
aVAre we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are.
p294
aVWould we be happy if our doctor's face, our lawyer's face,
p295
aVour financial adviser's face was covered?
p296
aVWe'd be pretty uncomfortable.
p297
aVBut are we good at making the judgments
p298
aVon facial appearance and movement?
p299
aVThe truth is that there's a five-minute rule,
p300
aVnot the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule.
p301
aVIf you spend five minutes with somebody,
p302
aVyou start looking beyond their facial appearance,
p303
aVand the people who you're initially attracted to
p304
aVmay seem boring and you lose interest in them,
p305
aVand the people who you didn't immediately seek out,
p306
aVbecause you didn't find them particularly attractive,
p307
aVbecome attractive people
p308
aVbecause of their personality.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo we've talked a lot about facial appearance.
p311
aVI now want to share
p312
aVa little bit of the surgery that we do \u2014
p313
aVwhere we're at and where we're going.
p314
aVThis is an image of Ann
p315
aVwho's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed.
p316
aVAnd you can see in the images afterward,
p317
aVwe've managed to reconstruct her successfully.
p318
aVBut that's not good enough.
p319
aVThis is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking,
p320
aVshe wants to be out climbing mountains.
p321
aVAnd that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to.
p322
aa(lp323
VThis is a horrific image,
p324
aVso I'm putting my hand up now.
p325
aVThis is a photograph of Adi,
p326
aVa Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off
p327
aVin an armed robbery.
p328
aVAnd he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin
p329
aVand his upper jaw and teeth.
p330
aVThis is the bar that he set for us.
p331
aV"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before."
p332
aVSo with modern technology,
p333
aVwe used computers to make models.
p334
aVWe made a model of the jaw without bone in it.
p335
aVWe then bent a plate up to it.
p336
aVWe put it in place
p337
aVso we knew it was an accurate position.
p338
aVWe then put bone and tissue from the back.
p339
aVHere you can see the plate holding it,
p340
aVand you can see the implants being put in \u2014
p341
aVso that in one operation
p342
aVwe achieve this
p343
aVand this.
p344
aVSo the patient's life is restored.
p345
aVThat's the good news.
p346
aVHowever, his chin skin
p347
aVdoesn't look the same as it did before.
p348
aVIt's skin from his back.
p349
aVIt's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours.
p350
aVAnd that's where we're failing,
p351
aVand that's where we need the face transplant.
p352
aa(lp353
VThe face transplant has a role
p354
aVprobably in burns patients to replace the skin.
p355
aVWe can replace the underlying skeletal structure,
p356
aVbut we're still not good at replacing the facial skin.
p357
aVSo it's very valuable
p358
aVto have that tool in our armamentarium.
p359
aVBut the patients are going to have to take drugs
p360
aVthat suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.
p361
aVWhat does that mean?
p362
aVThey have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.
p363
aVThis is not a life-saving transplant \u2014
p364
aVlike a heart, or liver, or lung transplant \u2014
p365
aVit is a quality-of-life transplant,
p366
aVand as a result,
p367
aVare the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on,
p368
aV"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this
p369
aVbecause I'm now dying of a malignant cancer"? We don't know yet.
p370
aVWe also don't know what they feel
p371
aVabout recognition and identity.
p372
aVBernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin, who did the first operation,
p373
aVare studying that.
p374
aVDonors are going to be short on the ground,
p375
aVbecause how many people want to have their loved one's face
p376
aVremoved at the point of death?
p377
aVSo there are going to be problems
p378
aVwith face transplantation.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo the better news is
p381
aVthe future's almost here \u2014
p382
aVand the future is tissue engineering.
p383
aVJust imagine,
p384
aVI can make a biologically-degradable template.
p385
aVI can put it in place where it's meant to be.
p386
aVI can sprinkle a few cells,
p387
aVstem cells from the patient's own hip,
p388
aVa little bit of genetically engineered protein,
p389
aVand lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown.
p390
aVThis is a bit like a Julia Child recipe.
p391
aa(lp392
VBut we've still got problems.
p393
aVWe've got mouth cancer to solve.
p394
aVWe're still not curing enough patients \u2014 it's the most disfiguring cancer.
p395
aVWe're still not reconstructing them well enough.
p396
aVIn the U.K. we have an epidemic
p397
aVof facial injuries among young people.
p398
aVWe still can't get rid of scars.
p399
aVWe need to do research.
p400
aVAnd the best news of all
p401
aVis that surgeons know
p402
aVthat we need to do research.
p403
aVAnd we've set up charities
p404
aVthat will help us fund
p405
aVthe clinical research
p406
aVto determine the best treatment practice now
p407
aVand better treatment into the future,
p408
aVso we don't just sit on our laurels and say, "Okay, we're doing okay.
p409
aVLet's leave it as it is."
p410
aa(lp411
VThank you very much indeed.

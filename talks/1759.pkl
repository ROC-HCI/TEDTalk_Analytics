VThe writer George Eliot cautioned us that,
p5
aVamong all forms of mistake,
p6
aVprophesy is the most gratuitous.
p7
aVThe person that we would all acknowledge
p8
aVas her 20th-century counterpart, Yogi Berra, agreed.
p9
aVHe said, "It's tough to make predictions,
p10
aVespecially about the future."
p11
aa(lp12
VI'm going to ignore their cautions
p13
aVand make one very specific forecast.
p14
aVIn the world that we are creating very quickly,
p15
aVwe're going to see more and more things
p16
aVthat look like science fiction,
p17
aVand fewer and fewer things that look like jobs.
p18
aVOur cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves,
p19
aVwhich means we're going to need fewer truck drivers.
p20
aVWe're going to hook Siri up to Watson
p21
aVand use that to automate a lot of the work
p22
aVthat's currently done by customer service reps
p23
aVand troubleshooters and diagnosers,
p24
aVand we're already taking R2D2,
p25
aVpainting him orange, and putting him to work
p26
aVcarrying shelves around warehouses,
p27
aVwhich means we need a lot fewer people
p28
aVto be walking up and down those aisles.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, for about 200 years,
p31
aVpeople have been saying exactly what I'm telling you \u2014
p32
aVthe age of technological unemployment is at hand \u2014
p33
aVstarting with the Luddites smashing looms in Britain
p34
aVjust about two centuries ago,
p35
aVand they have been wrong.
p36
aVOur economies in the developed world have coasted along
p37
aVon something pretty close to full employment.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhich brings up a critical question:
p40
aVWhy is this time different, if it really is?
p41
aVThe reason it's different is that, just in the past few years,
p42
aVour machines have started demonstrating skills
p43
aVthey have never, ever had before:
p44
aVunderstanding, speaking, hearing, seeing,
p45
aVanswering, writing, and they're still acquiring new skills.
p46
aVFor example, mobile humanoid robots
p47
aVare still incredibly primitive,
p48
aVbut the research arm of the Defense Department
p49
aVjust launched a competition
p50
aVto have them do things like this,
p51
aVand if the track record is any guide,
p52
aVthis competition is going to be successful.
p53
aVSo when I look around, I think the day is not too far off at all
p54
aVwhen we're going to have androids
p55
aVdoing a lot of the work that we are doing right now.
p56
aVAnd we're creating a world where there is going to be
p57
aVmore and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs.
p58
aVIt's a world that Erik Brynjolfsson and I are calling
p59
aV"the new machine age."
p60
aa(lp61
VThe thing to keep in mind is that
p62
aVthis is absolutely great news.
p63
aVThis is the best economic news on the planet these days.
p64
aVNot that there's a lot of competition, right?
p65
aVThis is the best economic news we have these days
p66
aVfor two main reasons.
p67
aVThe first is, technological progress is what allows us
p68
aVto continue this amazing recent run that we're on
p69
aVwhere output goes up over time,
p70
aVwhile at the same time, prices go down,
p71
aVand volume and quality just continue to explode.
p72
aVNow, some people look at this and talk about
p73
aVshallow materialism,
p74
aVbut that's absolutely the wrong way to look at it.
p75
aVThis is abundance, which is exactly
p76
aVwhat we want our economic system to provide.
p77
aVThe second reason that the new machine age
p78
aVis such great news is that, once the androids
p79
aVstart doing jobs, we don't have to do them anymore,
p80
aVand we get freed up from drudgery and toil.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, when I talk about this with my friends
p83
aVin Cambridge and Silicon Valley, they say,
p84
aV"Fantastic. No more drudgery, no more toil.
p85
aVThis gives us the chance to imagine
p86
aVan entirely different kind of society,
p87
aVa society where the creators and the discoverers
p88
aVand the performers and the innovators
p89
aVcome together with their patrons and their financiers
p90
aVto talk about issues, entertain, enlighten,
p91
aVprovoke each other."
p92
aVIt's a society really, that looks a lot like the TED Conference.
p93
aVAnd there's actually a huge amount of truth here.
p94
aVWe are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place.
p95
aVIn a world where it is just about as easy
p96
aVto generate an object as it is to print a document,
p97
aVwe have amazing new possibilities.
p98
aVThe people who used to be craftsmen and hobbyists
p99
aVare now makers, and they're responsible
p100
aVfor massive amounts of innovation.
p101
aVAnd artists who were formerly constrained
p102
aVcan now do things that were never, ever possible
p103
aVfor them before.
p104
aVSo this is a time of great flourishing,
p105
aVand the more I look around, the more convinced I become
p106
aVthat this quote, from the physicist Freeman Dyson,
p107
aVis not hyperbole at all.
p108
aVThis is just a plain statement of the facts.
p109
aVWe are in the middle of an astonishing period.
p110
aa(lp111
V["Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences." \u2014 Freeman Dyson]
p112
aa(lp113
VWhich brings up another great question:
p114
aVWhat could possibly go wrong in this new machine age?
p115
aVRight? Great, hang up, flourish, go home.
p116
aVWe're going to face two really thorny sets of challenges
p117
aVas we head deeper into the future that we're creating.
p118
aa(lp119
VThe first are economic, and they're really nicely summarized
p120
aVin an apocryphal story about a back-and-forth
p121
aVbetween Henry Ford II and Walter Reuther,
p122
aVwho was the head of the auto workers union.
p123
aVThey were touring one of the new modern factories,
p124
aVand Ford playfully turns to Reuther and says,
p125
aV"Hey Walter, how are you going to get these robots
p126
aVto pay union dues?"
p127
aVAnd Reuther shoots back, "Hey Henry,
p128
aVhow are you going to get them to buy cars?"
p129
aa(lp130
VReuther's problem in that anecdote
p131
aVis that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy
p132
aVthat's full of machines,
p133
aVand we see this very clearly in the statistics.
p134
aVIf you look over the past couple decades
p135
aVat the returns to capital \u2014 in other words, corporate profits \u2014
p136
aVwe see them going up,
p137
aVand we see that they're now at an all-time high.
p138
aVIf we look at the returns to labor, in other words
p139
aVtotal wages paid out in the economy,
p140
aVwe see them at an all-time low
p141
aVand heading very quickly in the opposite direction.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo this is clearly bad news for Reuther.
p144
aVIt looks like it might be great news for Ford,
p145
aVbut it's actually not. If you want to sell
p146
aVhuge volumes of somewhat expensive goods to people,
p147
aVyou really want a large, stable, prosperous middle class.
p148
aVWe have had one of those in America
p149
aVfor just about the entire postwar period.
p150
aVBut the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now.
p151
aVWe all know a lot of the statistics,
p152
aVbut just to repeat one of them,
p153
aVmedian income in America has actually gone down
p154
aVover the past 15 years,
p155
aVand we're in danger of getting trapped
p156
aVin some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization
p157
aVcontinue to go up over time.
p158
aa(lp159
VThe societal challenges that come along
p160
aVwith that kind of inequality deserve some attention.
p161
aVThere are a set of societal challenges
p162
aVthat I'm actually not that worried about,
p163
aVand they're captured by images like this.
p164
aVThis is not the kind of societal problem
p165
aVthat I am concerned about.
p166
aVThere is no shortage of dystopian visions
p167
aVabout what happens when our machines become self-aware,
p168
aVand they decide to rise up and coordinate attacks against us.
p169
aVI'm going to start worrying about those
p170
aVthe day my computer becomes aware of my printer.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p173
aa(lp174
VSo this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about.
p175
aVTo tell you the kinds of societal challenges
p176
aVthat are going to come up in the new machine age,
p177
aVI want to tell a story about two stereotypical American workers.
p178
aVAnd to make them really stereotypical,
p179
aVlet's make them both white guys.
p180
aVAnd the first one is a college-educated
p181
aVprofessional, creative type, manager,
p182
aVengineer, doctor, lawyer, that kind of worker.
p183
aVWe're going to call him "Ted."
p184
aVHe's at the top of the American middle class.
p185
aVHis counterpart is not college-educated
p186
aVand works as a laborer, works as a clerk,
p187
aVdoes low-level white collar or blue collar work in the economy.
p188
aVWe're going to call that guy "Bill."
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd if you go back about 50 years,
p191
aVBill and Ted were leading remarkably similar lives.
p192
aVFor example, in 1960 they were both very likely
p193
aVto have full-time jobs, working at least 40 hours a week.
p194
aVBut as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented,
p195
aVas we started to automate the economy,
p196
aVand 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses,
p197
aVas we started to progressively inject technology
p198
aVand automation and digital stuff into the economy,
p199
aVthe fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot.
p200
aVOver this time frame, Ted has continued
p201
aVto hold a full-time job. Bill hasn't.
p202
aVIn many cases, Bill has left the economy entirely,
p203
aVand Ted very rarely has.
p204
aVOver time, Ted's marriage has stayed quite happy.
p205
aVBill's hasn't.
p206
aVAnd Ted's kids have grown up in a two-parent home,
p207
aVwhile Bill's absolutely have not over time.
p208
aVOther ways that Bill is dropping out of society?
p209
aVHe's decreased his voting in presidential elections,
p210
aVand he's started to go to prison a lot more often.
p211
aVSo I cannot tell a happy story about these social trends,
p212
aVand they don't show any signs of reversing themselves.
p213
aVThey're also true no matter which ethnic group
p214
aVor demographic group we look at,
p215
aVand they're actually getting so severe
p216
aVthat they're in danger of overwhelming
p217
aVeven the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd what my friends in Silicon Valley
p220
aVand Cambridge are overlooking is that they're Ted.
p221
aVThey're living these amazingly busy, productive lives,
p222
aVand they've got all the benefits to show from that,
p223
aVwhile Bill is leading a very different life.
p224
aVThey're actually both proof of how right Voltaire was
p225
aVwhen he talked about the benefits of work,
p226
aVand the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils.
p227
aa(lp228
V["Work saves a man from three great evils: boredom, vice and need." \u2014 Voltaire]
p229
aa(lp230
VSo with these challenges, what do we do about them?
p231
aa(lp232
VThe economic playbook is surprisingly clear,
p233
aVsurprisingly straightforward, in the short term especially.
p234
aVThe robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two,
p235
aVso the classic Econ 101 playbook is going to work just fine:
p236
aVEncourage entrepreneurship,
p237
aVdouble down on infrastructure,
p238
aVand make sure we're turning out people
p239
aVfrom our educational system with the appropriate skills.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut over the longer term, if we are moving into an economy
p242
aVthat's heavy on technology and light on labor,
p243
aVand we are, then we have to consider
p244
aVsome more radical interventions,
p245
aVfor example, something like a guaranteed minimum income.
p246
aVNow, that's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable,
p247
aVbecause that idea is associated with the extreme left wing
p248
aVand with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth.
p249
aVI did a little bit of research on this notion,
p250
aVand it might calm some folk down to know that
p251
aVthe idea of a net guaranteed minimum income
p252
aVhas been championed by those frothing-at-the-mouth socialists
p253
aVFriedrich Hayek, Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman.
p254
aVAnd if you find yourself worried
p255
aVthat something like a guaranteed income
p256
aVis going to stifle our drive to succeed
p257
aVand make us kind of complacent,
p258
aVyou might be interested to know that social mobility,
p259
aVone of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States,
p260
aVis now lower than it is in the northern European countries
p261
aVthat have these very generous social safety nets.
p262
aVSo the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward.
p263
aa(lp264
VThe societal one is a lot more challenging.
p265
aVI don't know what the playbook is
p266
aVfor getting Bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life.
p267
aa(lp268
VI do know that education is a huge part of it.
p269
aVI witnessed this firsthand.
p270
aVI was a Montessori kid for the first few years of my education,
p271
aVand what that education taught me
p272
aVis that the world is an interesting place
p273
aVand my job is to go explore it.
p274
aVThe school stopped in third grade,
p275
aVso then I entered the public school system,
p276
aVand it felt like I had been sent to the Gulag.
p277
aVWith the benefit of hindsight, I now know the job
p278
aVwas to prepare me for life as a clerk or a laborer,
p279
aVbut at the time it felt like the job was to kind of
p280
aVbore me into some submission with what was going on around me.
p281
aVWe have to do better than this.
p282
aVWe cannot keep turning out Bills.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo we see some green shoots that things are getting better.
p285
aVWe see technology deeply impacting education
p286
aVand engaging people, from our youngest learners
p287
aVup to our oldest ones.
p288
aVWe see very prominent business voices telling us
p289
aVwe need to rethink some of the things that we've been holding dear for a while.
p290
aVAnd we see very serious and sustained
p291
aVand data-driven efforts to understand
p292
aVhow to intervene in some of the most troubled communities that we have.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo the green shoots are out there.
p295
aVI don't want to pretend for a minute
p296
aVthat what we have is going to be enough.
p297
aVWe're facing very tough challenges.
p298
aVTo give just one example, there are about five million Americans
p299
aVwho have been unemployed for at least six months.
p300
aVWe're not going to fix things for them
p301
aVby sending them back to Montessori.
p302
aVAnd my biggest worry is that we're creating a world
p303
aVwhere we're going to have glittering technologies
p304
aVembedded in kind of a shabby society
p305
aVand supported by an economy that generates inequality
p306
aVinstead of opportunity.
p307
aa(lp308
VBut I actually don't think that's what we're going to do.
p309
aVI think we're going to do something a lot better
p310
aVfor one very straightforward reason:
p311
aVThe facts are getting out there.
p312
aVThe realities of this new machine age
p313
aVand the change in the economy are becoming more widely known.
p314
aVIf we wanted to accelerate that process, we could do things
p315
aVlike have our best economists and policymakers
p316
aVplay "Jeopardy!" against Watson.
p317
aVWe could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip.
p318
aVAnd if we do enough of these kinds of things,
p319
aVthe awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different.
p320
aVAnd then we're off to the races,
p321
aVbecause I don't believe for a second
p322
aVthat we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges
p323
aVor that we have become too apathetic or hard-hearted to even try.
p324
aa(lp325
VI started my talk with quotes from wordsmiths
p326
aVwho were separated by an ocean and a century.
p327
aVLet me end it with words from politicians
p328
aVwho were similarly distant.
p329
aa(lp330
VWinston Churchill came to my home of MIT in 1949,
p331
aVand he said, "If we are to bring the broad masses
p332
aVof the people in every land to the table of abundance,
p333
aVit can only be by the tireless improvement
p334
aVof all of our means of technical production."
p335
aa(lp336
VAbraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient.
p337
aVHe said, "I am a firm believer in the people.
p338
aVIf given the truth, they can be depended upon
p339
aVto meet any national crisis.
p340
aVThe great point is to give them the plain facts."
p341
aa(lp342
VSo the optimistic note, great point that I want to leave you with
p343
aVis that the plain facts of the machine age are becoming clear,
p344
aVand I have every confidence that we're going to use them
p345
aVto chart a good course into the challenging,
p346
aVabundant economy that we're creating.
p347
aa(lp348
VThank you very much.
p349
aa(lp350

VI'm going to talk about religion.
p5
aVBut it's a broad and very delicate subject,
p6
aVso I have to limit myself.
p7
aVAnd therefore I will limit myself
p8
aVto only talk about the links between religion and sexuality.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is a very serious talk.
p13
aVSo I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful.
p14
aVIt's when the young couple whisper,
p15
aV"Tonight we are going to make a baby."
p16
aVMy talk will be about the impact of religions
p17
aVon the number of babies per woman.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is indeed important,
p20
aVbecause everyone understands
p21
aVthat there is some sort of limit
p22
aVon how many people we can be on this planet.
p23
aVAnd there are some people
p24
aVwho say that the world population is growing like this \u2014
p25
aVthree billion in 1960,
p26
aVseven billion just last year \u2014
p27
aVand it will continue to grow
p28
aVbecause there are religions that stop women from having few babies,
p29
aVand it may continue like this.
p30
aa(lp31
VTo what extent are these people right?
p32
aVWhen I was born there was less than one billion children in the world,
p33
aVand today, 2000, there's almost two billion.
p34
aVWhat has happened since,
p35
aVand what do the experts predict will happen
p36
aVwith the number of children during this century?
p37
aa(lp38
VThis is a quiz. What do you think?
p39
aVDo you think it will decrease to one billion?
p40
aVWill it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century?
p41
aVWill the number of children increase each year up to 15 years,
p42
aVor will it continue in the same fast rate
p43
aVand be four billion children up there?
p44
aVI will tell you by the end of my speech.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut now, what does religion have to do with it?
p47
aVWhen you want to classify religion,
p48
aVit's more difficult than you think.
p49
aVYou go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this.
p50
aVIt divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion,
p51
aVbut that's not detailed enough.
p52
aVSo we went on and we looked in Wikipedia, we found this map.
p53
aVBut that subdivides Christianity, Islam and Buddhism
p54
aVinto many subgroups,
p55
aVwhich was too detailed.
p56
aa(lp57
VTherefore at Gapminder we made our own map,
p58
aVand it looks like this.
p59
aVEach country's a bubble.
p60
aVThe size is the population \u2014 big China, big India here.
p61
aVAnd the color now is the majority religion.
p62
aVIt's the religion where more than 50 percent of the people
p63
aVsay that they belong.
p64
aVIt's Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries.
p65
aVIslam is the majority religion
p66
aVall the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East,
p67
aVSouthern Europe and through Asia
p68
aVall the way to Indonesia.
p69
aVThat's where we find Islamic majority.
p70
aVAnd Christian majority religions, we see in these countries. They are blue.
p71
aVAnd that is most countries in America and Europe,
p72
aVmany countries in Africa and a few in Asia.
p73
aVThe white here are countries which cannot be classified,
p74
aVbecause one religion does not reach 50 percent
p75
aVor there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason.
p76
aVSo we were careful with that.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot.
p79
aVThis is in 1960.
p80
aVAnd now I show the number of babies per woman here:
p81
aVtwo, four or six \u2014
p82
aVmany babies, few babies.
p83
aVAnd here the income per person in comparable dollars.
p84
aVThe reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first
p85
aVbefore you get few babies.
p86
aVSo low income here, high income there.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd indeed in 1960,
p89
aVyou had to be a rich Christian to have few babies.
p90
aVThe exception was Japan.
p91
aVJapan here was regarded as an exception.
p92
aVOtherwise it was only Christian countries.
p93
aVBut there was also many Christian countries
p94
aVthat had six to seven babies per woman.
p95
aVBut they were in Latin America or they were in Africa.
p96
aVAnd countries with Islam as the majority religion,
p97
aVall of them almost had six to seven children per woman,
p98
aVirregardless of the income level.
p99
aVAnd all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow let's see what has happened in the world.
p102
aVI start the world, and here we go.
p103
aVNow 1962 \u2014 can you see they're getting a little richer,
p104
aVbut the number of babies per woman is falling?
p105
aVLook at China. They're falling fairly fast.
p106
aVAnd all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down,
p107
aVas do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range.
p108
aVAnd when we enter into this century,
p109
aVyou'll find more than half of mankind down here.
p110
aVAnd by 2010, we are actually 80 percent of humans
p111
aVwho live in countries with about two children per woman.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VIt's a quite amazing development which has happened.
p116
aV(Applause)
p117
aVAnd these are countries from United States here,
p118
aVwith $40,000 per capita,
p119
aVFrance, Russia, Iran,
p120
aVMexico, Turkey, Algeria,
p121
aVIndonesia, India
p122
aVand all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam,
p123
aVwhich has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States
p124
aVand the same amount of babies per woman.
p125
aa(lp126
VI can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman
p127
aVis surprisingly good in all countries.
p128
aVWe get that from the census data.
p129
aVIt's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo what we can conclude
p132
aVis you don't have to get rich to have few children.
p133
aVIt has happened across the world.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd then when we look at religions,
p136
aVwe can see that the Eastern religions,
p137
aVindeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion
p138
aVthat has more than three children.
p139
aVWhereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity,
p140
aVyou see countries all the way.
p141
aVBut there's no major difference.
p142
aVThere's no major difference between these religions.
p143
aVThere is a difference with income.
p144
aVThe countries which have many babies per woman here,
p145
aVthey have quite low income.
p146
aVMost of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.
p147
aVBut there are also countries here
p148
aVlike Guatemala, like Papua New Guinea,
p149
aVlike Yemen and Afghanistan.
p150
aa(lp151
VMany think that Afghanistan here and Congo,
p152
aVwhich have suffered severe conflicts,
p153
aVthat they don't have fast population growth.
p154
aVIt's the other way around.
p155
aVIn the world today, it's the countries that have the highest mortality rates
p156
aVthat have the fastest population growth.
p157
aVBecause the death of a child is compensated by one more child.
p158
aVThese countries have six children per woman.
p159
aVThey have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman.
p160
aVBut 30 years from now, Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million.
p161
aVCongo will go from 60 to 120.
p162
aVThat's where we have the fast population growth.
p163
aVAnd many think that these countries are stagnant, but they are not.
p164
aa(lp165
VLet me compare Senegal, a Muslim dominated country,
p166
aVwith a Christian dominated country, Ghana.
p167
aVI take them backwards here to their independence,
p168
aVwhen they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s.
p169
aVJust look what they have done.
p170
aVIt's an amazing improvement,
p171
aVfrom seven children per woman,
p172
aVthey've gone all the way down to between four and five.
p173
aVIt's a tremendous improvement.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo what does it take?
p176
aVWell we know quite well what is needed in these countries.
p177
aVYou need to have children to survive.
p178
aVYou need to get out of the deepest poverty
p179
aVso children are not of importance for work in the family.
p180
aVYou need to have access to some family planning.
p181
aVAnd you need the fourth factor, which perhaps is the most important factor.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut let me illustrate that fourth factor
p184
aVby looking at Qatar.
p185
aVHere we have Qatar today, and there we have Bangladesh today.
p186
aVIf I take these countries back to the years of their independence,
p187
aVwhich is almost the same year \u2014 '71, '72 \u2014
p188
aVit's a quite amazing development which had happened.
p189
aVLook at Bangladesh and Qatar.
p190
aVWith so different incomes, it's almost the same drop
p191
aVin number of babies per woman.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd what is the reason in Qatar?
p194
aVWell I do as I always do.
p195
aVI went to the statistical authority of Qatar, to their webpage \u2014
p196
aVIt's a very good webpage. I recommend it \u2014
p197
aVand I looked up \u2014 oh yeah, you can have lots of fun here \u2014
p198
aVand provided free of charge, I found Qatar's social trends.
p199
aVVery interesting. Lots to read.
p200
aVI found fertility at birth, and I looked at total fertility rate per woman.
p201
aVThese are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar,
p202
aVand they say the most important factors are:
p203
aV"Increased age at first marriage,
p204
aVincreased educational level of Qatari woman
p205
aVand more women integrated in the labor force."
p206
aVI couldn't agree more. Science couldn't agree more.
p207
aVThis is a country that indeed has gone through
p208
aVa very, very interesting modernization.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo what it is, is these four:
p211
aVChildren should survive, children shouldn't be needed for work,
p212
aVwomen should get education and join the labor force
p213
aVand family planning should be accessible.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow look again at this.
p216
aVThe average number of children in the world
p217
aVis like in Colombia \u2014 it's 2.4 today.
p218
aVThere are countries up here which are very poor.
p219
aVAnd that's where family planning, better child survival is needed.
p220
aVI strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk.
p221
aVAnd here, down, there are many countries which are less than two children per woman.
p222
aVSo when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz,
p223
aVit's two.
p224
aa(lp225
VWe have reached peak child.
p226
aVThe number of children is not growing any longer in the world.
p227
aVWe are still debating peak oil,
p228
aVbut we have definitely reached peak child.
p229
aVAnd the world population will stop growing.
p230
aVThe United Nations Population Division has said
p231
aVit will stop growing at 10 billion.
p232
aVBut why do they grow if the number of children doesn't grow?
p233
aa(lp234
VWell I will show you here.
p235
aVI will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came.
p236
aVThey are quite useful for educational purposes.
p237
aVEach card box is one billion people.
p238
aVAnd there are two billion children in the world.
p239
aVThere are two billion young people between 15 and 30.
p240
aVThese are rounded numbers.
p241
aVThen there is one billion between 30 and 45,
p242
aValmost one between 45 and 60.
p243
aVAnd then it's my box.
p244
aVThis is me: 60-plus.
p245
aVWe are here on top.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo what will happen now is what we call "the big fill-up."
p248
aVYou can see that it's like three billion missing here.
p249
aVThey are not missing because they've died; they were never born.
p250
aVBecause before 1980, there were much fewer people born
p251
aVthan there were during the last 30 years.
p252
aVSo what will happen now is quite straightforward.
p253
aVThe old, sadly, we will die.
p254
aVThe rest of you, you will grow older and you will get two billion children.
p255
aVThen the old will die.
p256
aVThe rest will grow older and get two billion children.
p257
aVAnd then again the old will die and you will get two billion children.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VThis is the great fill-up.
p262
aVIt's inevitable.
p263
aVAnd can you see that this increase took place
p264
aVwithout life getting longer and without adding children?
p265
aa(lp266
VReligion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman.
p267
aVAll the religions in the world are fully capable
p268
aVto maintain their values and adapt to this new world.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd we will be just 10 billion in this world,
p271
aVif the poorest people get out of poverty,
p272
aVtheir children survive, they get access to family planning.
p273
aVThat is needed.
p274
aVBut it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more.
p275
aVSo when you discuss and when you plan
p276
aVfor the resources and the energy needed for the future,
p277
aVfor human beings on this planet,
p278
aVyou have to plan for 10 billion.
p279
aVThank you very much.
p280
aV(Applause)

A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />As if all this weren&#39;t enough, the irrepressible Rosling is also an accomplished sword-swallower &mdash; a skill he demonstrated at TED2007.<br /><br /><br /> </p>", "slug": "hans_rosling", "whotheyare": "In Hans Rosling\\u2019s hands, data sings.

most worldly and well-traveled among us will have their perspectives shifted by Hans Rosling. A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />As if all this weren&#39;t enough, the irrepressible Rosling is also an accomplished sword-swallower &mdash; a skill he demonstrated at TED2007.<br /><br /><br /> </p>", "slug": "hans_rosling", "whotheyare": "In Hans Rosling\\u2019s hands, data sings.

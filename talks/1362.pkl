VThe world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project
p5
aVis situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world,
p6
aVCanada's boreal forest.
p7
aVIt stretches right across Northern Canada, in Labrador,
p8
aVit's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world:
p9
aVthe George River caribou herd,
p10
aVnumbering approximately 400,000 animals.
p11
aVUnfortunately, when I was there, I couldn't find one of them,
p12
aVbut you have the antlers as proof.
p13
aa(lp14
VAll across the boreal,
p15
aVwe're blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands.
p16
aVWetlands, globally, are one of the most endangered ecosystems.
p17
aVThey're absolutely critical ecosystems,
p18
aVthey clean air, they clean water,
p19
aVthey sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases,
p20
aVand they're home to a huge diversity of species.
p21
aVIn the boreal, they are also the home
p22
aVwhere almost 50 percent of the 800 bird species found in North America
p23
aVmigrate north to breed and raise their young.
p24
aa(lp25
VIn Ontario, the boreal marches down south to the north shore of Lake Superior.
p26
aVAnd these incredibly beautiful boreal forests
p27
aVwere the inspiration for some of the most famous art in Canadian history,
p28
aVthe Group of Seven were very inspired by this landscape,
p29
aVand so the boreal is not just a really key part of our natural heritage,
p30
aVbut also an important part of our cultural heritage.
p31
aa(lp32
VIn Manitoba, this is an image from the east side of Lake Winnipeg,
p33
aVand this is the home of the newly designated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site.
p34
aVIn Saskatchewan, as across all of the boreal,
p35
aVhome to some of our most famous rivers,
p36
aVan incredible network of rivers and lakes that every school-age child learns about,
p37
aVthe Peace, the Athabasca, the Churchill here, the Mackenzie,
p38
aVand these networks were the historical routes
p39
aVfor the voyageur and the coureur de bois,
p40
aVthe first non-aboriginal explorers of Northern Canada
p41
aVthat, taking from the First Nations people,
p42
aVused canoes and paddled to explore
p43
aVfor a trade route, a Northwest Passage for the fur trade.
p44
aa(lp45
VIn the North, the boreal is bordered by the tundra,
p46
aVand just below that, in Yukon,
p47
aVwe have this incredible valley, the Tombstone Valley.
p48
aVAnd the Tombstone Valley is home to the Porcupine caribou herd.
p49
aVNow you've probably heard about the Porcupine caribou herd
p50
aVin the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
p51
aVWell, the wintering ground is also critical
p52
aVand it also is not protected,
p53
aVand is potentially, could be potentially, exploited for gas and mineral rights.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe western border of the boreal in British Columbia
p56
aVis marked by the Coast Mountains,
p57
aVand on the other side of those mountains
p58
aVis the greatest remaining temperate rainforest in the world,
p59
aVthe Great Bear Rainforest,
p60
aVand we'll discuss that in a few minutes in a bit more detail.
p61
aa(lp62
VAll across the boreal,
p63
aVit's home for a huge incredible range of indigenous peoples,
p64
aVand a rich and varied culture.
p65
aVAnd I think that one of the reasons
p66
aVwhy so many of these groups have retained a link to the past,
p67
aVknow their native languages,
p68
aVthe songs, the dances, the traditions,
p69
aVI think part of that reason is because of the remoteness,
p70
aVthe span and the wilderness
p71
aVof this almost 95 percent intact ecosystem.
p72
aVAnd I think particularly now,
p73
aVas we see ourselves in a time of environmental crisis,
p74
aVwe can learn so much from these people
p75
aVwho have lived so sustainably in this ecosystem
p76
aVfor over 10,000 years.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn the heart of this ecosystem is the very antithesis
p79
aVof all of these values that we've been talking about,
p80
aVand I think these are some of the core values
p81
aVthat make us proud to be Canadians.
p82
aVThis is the Alberta tar sands,
p83
aVthe largest oil reserves on the planet outside of Saudi Arabia.
p84
aVTrapped underneath the boreal forest and wetlands of northern Alberta
p85
aVare these vast reserves of this sticky, tar-like bitumen.
p86
aVAnd the mining and the exploitation of that
p87
aVis creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before.
p88
aa(lp89
VI want to try to convey some sort of a sense of the size of this.
p90
aVIf you look at that truck there,
p91
aVit is the largest truck of its kind on the planet.
p92
aVIt is a 400-ton-capacity dump truck
p93
aVand its dimensions are 45 feet long by 35 feet wide and 25 feet high.
p94
aVIf I stand beside that truck,
p95
aVmy head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap.
p96
aVWithin the dimensions of that truck,
p97
aVyou could build a 3,000-square-foot two-story home quite easily.
p98
aVI did the math.
p99
aVSo instead of thinking of that as a truck, think of that as a 3,000-square-foot home.
p100
aVThat's not a bad size home.
p101
aVAnd line those trucks / homes back and forth
p102
aVacross there from the bottom all the way to the top.
p103
aVAnd then think of how large that very small section of one mine is.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well.
p106
aVNow, here you see \u2014 of course, as you go further on,
p107
aVthese trucks become like a pixel.
p108
aVAgain, imagine those all back and forth there.
p109
aVHow large is that one portion of a mine?
p110
aVThat would be a huge, vast metropolitan area,
p111
aVprobably much larger than the city of Victoria.
p112
aVAnd this is just one of a number of mines,
p113
aV10 mines so far right now.
p114
aVThis is one section of one mining complex,
p115
aVand there are about another 40 or 50 in the approval process.
p116
aVNo tar sands mine has actually ever been denied approval,
p117
aVso it is essentially a rubber stamp.
p118
aa(lp119
VThe other method of extraction is what's called the in situ.
p120
aVAnd here, massive amounts of water
p121
aVare superheated and pumped through the ground,
p122
aVthrough these vasts networks of pipelines,
p123
aVseismic lines, drill paths, compressor stations.
p124
aVAnd even though this looks maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines,
p125
aVit's even more damaging in some ways.
p126
aVIt impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness,
p127
aVwhere there is 90 percent reduction of key species,
p128
aVlike woodland caribou and grizzly bears,
p129
aVand it consumes even more energy, more water,
p130
aVand produces at least as much greenhouse gas.
p131
aVSo these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe oil produced from either method
p134
aVproduces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil.
p135
aVThis is one of the reasons why it's called the world's dirtiest oil.
p136
aVIt's also one of the reasons
p137
aVwhy it is the largest and fastest-growing single source of carbon in Canada,
p138
aVand it is also a reason why Canada is now number three
p139
aVin terms of producing carbon per person.
p140
aVThe tailings ponds are the largest toxic impoundments on the planet.
p141
aVOil sands \u2014 or rather, I should say tar sands \u2014
p142
aVoil sands is a PR-created term
p143
aVso that the oil companies wouldn't be trying to promote something
p144
aVthat sounds like a sticky tar-like substance that's the world's dirtiest oil.
p145
aVSo they decided to call it oil sands.
p146
aVThe tar sands consume more water than any other oil process,
p147
aVthree to five barrels of water are taken, polluted
p148
aVand then returned into tailings ponds,
p149
aVthe largest toxic impoundments on the planet.
p150
aa(lp151
VSemCrude, just one of the licensees, in just one of their tailings ponds,
p152
aVdumps 250,000 tons of this toxic gunk every single day.
p153
aVThat's creating the largest toxic impoundments in the history of the planet.
p154
aVSo far, this is enough toxin to cover the face of Lake Erie a foot deep.
p155
aVAnd the tailings ponds range in size up to 9,000 acres.
p156
aVThat's two-thirds the size of the entire island of Manhattan.
p157
aVThat's like from Wall Street at the southern edge of Manhattan
p158
aVup to maybe 120th Street.
p159
aVSo this is one of the larger tailings ponds.
p160
aVThis might be, what? I don't know, half the size of Manhattan.
p161
aVAnd you can see in the context,
p162
aVit's just a relatively small section of one of 10 mining complexes
p163
aVand another 40 to 50 on stream to be approved soon.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd of course, these tailings ponds \u2014
p166
aVwell, you can't see many ponds from outer space
p167
aVand you can see these, so maybe we should stop calling them ponds \u2014
p168
aVthese massive toxic wastelands are built
p169
aVunlined and on the banks of the Athabasca River.
p170
aVAnd the Athabasca River drains downstream to a range of aboriginal communities.
p171
aVIn Fort Chipewyan, the 800 people there, are finding toxins in the food chain,
p172
aVthis has been scientifically proven.
p173
aVThe tar sands toxins are in the food chain,
p174
aVand this is causing cancer rates up to 10 times
p175
aVwhat they are in the rest of Canada.
p176
aa(lp177
VIn spite of that, people have to live, have to eat this food in order to survive.
p178
aVThe incredibly high price of flying food
p179
aVinto these remote Northern aboriginal communities
p180
aVand the high rate of unemployment
p181
aVmakes this an absolute necessity for survival.
p182
aVAnd not that many years ago, I was lent a boat by a First Nations man,
p183
aVand he said, "When you go out on the river,
p184
aVdo not under any circumstances eat the fish.
p185
aVIt's carcinogenic."
p186
aVAnd yet, on the front porch of that man's cabin,
p187
aVI saw four fish.
p188
aVHe had to feed his family to survive.
p189
aVAnd as a parent, I just can't imagine what that does to your soul.
p190
aVAnd that's what we're doing.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense
p193
aVagainst global warming and climate change.
p194
aVThe boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem.
p195
aVAnd this is absolutely key.
p196
aVSo what we're doing is,
p197
aVwe're taking the most concentrated greenhouse gas sink \u2014
p198
aVtwice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered
p199
aVin the boreal per acre than the tropical rainforests.
p200
aVAnd what we're doing is we're destroying
p201
aVthis carbon sink, turning it into a carbon bomb.
p202
aVAnd we're replacing that with the largest industrial project
p203
aVin the history of the world,
p204
aVwhich is producing the most high-carbon greenhouse-gas emitting oil in the world.
p205
aVAnd we're doing this on the second largest oil reserves on the planet.
p206
aa(lp207
VThis is one of the reasons why Canada, originally a climate change hero \u2014
p208
aVwe were one of the first signatories of the Kyoto Accord.
p209
aVNow we're the country that has full-time lobbyists
p210
aVin the European Union and Washington DC,
p211
aVthreatening trade wars
p212
aVwhen these countries talk about wanting to bring in positive legislation
p213
aVto limit the import of high-carbon fuels,
p214
aVof greenhouse gas emissions, anything like this,
p215
aVat international conferences, whether they're in Copenhagen or Cancun,
p216
aVinternational conferences on climate change,
p217
aVwe're the country that gets the dinosaur award every single day,
p218
aVas being the biggest obstacle to progress on this issue.
p219
aa(lp220
VJust 70 miles downstream
p221
aVis the world's largest freshwater delta, the Peace-Athabasca Delta,
p222
aVthe only one at the juncture of all four migratory flyways.
p223
aVThis is a globally significant wetland, perhaps the greatest on the planet.
p224
aVIncredible habitat for half the bird species
p225
aVyou find in North America, migrating here.
p226
aVAnd also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison,
p227
aVand also, of course, critical habitat for another whole range of other species.
p228
aVBut it too is being threatened
p229
aVby the massive amount of water being drawn from the Athabasca,
p230
aVwhich feeds these wetlands,
p231
aVand also the incredible toxic burden
p232
aVof the largest toxic unlined impoundments on the planet,
p233
aVwhich are leaching in to the food chain for all the species downstream.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo as bad as all that is, things are going to get much worse \u2014 much, much worse.
p236
aVThis is the infrastructure as we see it about now.
p237
aVThis is what's planned for 2015.
p238
aVAnd you can see here the Keystone Pipeline,
p239
aVwhich would take tar sands raw down to the Gulf Coast,
p240
aVpunching a pipeline through the agricultural heart of North America,
p241
aVof the United States,
p242
aVand securing the contract with the dirtiest fuel in the world
p243
aVby consumption of the United States,
p244
aVand promoting a huge disincentive
p245
aVto a sustainable clean-energy future for America.
p246
aa(lp247
VHere you see the route down the Mackenzie valley.
p248
aVThis would put a pipeline to take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea
p249
aVthrough the heart of the third largest watershed basin in the world,
p250
aVand the only one which is 95 percent intact.
p251
aVAnd building a pipeline with an industrial highway
p252
aVwould change forever this incredible wilderness,
p253
aVwhich is a true rarity on the planet today.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo the Great Bear Rainforest is just over the hill there,
p256
aVwithin a few miles, we go from these dry boreal forests
p257
aVof 100-year-old trees, maybe 10 inches across,
p258
aVand soon, we're in the coastal temperate rainforest,
p259
aVrain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees,
p260
aV20 feet across, a completely different ecosystem.
p261
aVAnd the Great Bear Rainforest is generally considered to be
p262
aVthe largest coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem in the world.
p263
aVSome of the greatest densities
p264
aVof some of the most iconic and threatened species on the planet.
p265
aVAnd yet there's a proposal, of course, to build a pipeline
p266
aVto take huge tankers, 10 times the size of the Exxon Valdez,
p267
aVthrough some of the most difficult-to-navigate waters in the world,
p268
aVwhere only just a few years ago, a BC ferry ran aground.
p269
aVWhen one of these tar sands tankers,
p270
aVcarrying the dirtiest oil, 10 times as much as the Exxon Valdez,
p271
aVeventually hits a rock and goes down,
p272
aVwe're going to have one of the worst ecological disasters
p273
aVthis planet has ever seen.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd here we have the plan out to 2030.
p276
aVWhat they're proposing is an almost four-times increase in production,
p277
aVand that would industrialize an area the size of Florida.
p278
aVIn doing so, we'll be removing a large part of our greatest carbon sink
p279
aVand replacing it with the most high greenhouse-gas emission oil in the future.
p280
aVThe world does not need any more tar mines.
p281
aVThe world does not need any more pipelines
p282
aVto wed our addiction to fossil fuels.
p283
aVAnd the world certainly does not need
p284
aVthe largest toxic impoundments to grow and multiply
p285
aVand further threaten the downstream communities.
p286
aVAnd let's face it, we all live downstream
p287
aVin an era of global warming and climate change.
p288
aa(lp289
VWhat we need, is we all need to act
p290
aVto ensure that Canada respects the massive amounts of freshwater
p291
aVthat we hold in this country.
p292
aVWe need to ensure that these wetlands and forests
p293
aVthat are our best and greatest and most critical defense
p294
aVagainst global warming are protected,
p295
aVand we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere.
p296
aVAnd we need to all gather together and say no to the tar sands.
p297
aVAnd we can do that.
p298
aVthere is a huge network all over the world,
p299
aVfighting to stop this project.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd I quite simply think
p302
aVthat this is not something that should be decided just in Canada.
p303
aVEveryone in this room, everyone across Canada,
p304
aVeveryone listening to this presentation
p305
aVhas a role to play and, I think, a responsibility.
p306
aVBecause what we do here is going to change our history,
p307
aVit's going to color our possibility to survive,
p308
aVand for our children to survive and have a rich future.
p309
aa(lp310
VWe have an incredible gift in the boreal,
p311
aVan incredible opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming,
p312
aVbut we could let that slip away.
p313
aVThe tar sands could threaten not just a large section of the boreal.
p314
aVIt compromises the life and the health
p315
aVof some of our most underprivileged and vulnerable people,
p316
aVthe aboriginal communities that have so much to teach us.
p317
aVIt could destroy the Athabasca Delta,
p318
aVthe largest and possibly greatest freshwater delta in the planet.
p319
aVIt could destroy the Great Bear Rainforest,
p320
aVthe largest temperate rainforest in the world.
p321
aVAnd it could have huge impacts
p322
aVon the future of the agricultural heartland of North America.
p323
aa(lp324
VI hope that you will all, if you've been moved by this presentation,
p325
aVjoin with the growing international community
p326
aVto get Canada to step up to its responsibilities,
p327
aVto convince Canada to go back to being a climate change champion
p328
aVinstead of a climate change villain,
p329
aVand to say no to the tar sands,
p330
aVand yes to a clean energy future for all.
p331
aVThank you so much.

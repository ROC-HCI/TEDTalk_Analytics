VI want to take you back basically to my hometown,
p5
aVand to a picture of my hometown of the week
p6
aVthat "Emergence" came out.
p7
aVAnd it's a picture we've seen several times.
p8
aVBasically, "Emergence" was published on 9/11.
p9
aVI live right there in the West Village,
p10
aVso the plume was luckily blowing west, away from us.
p11
aVWe had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours \u2014
p12
aVwe hadn't taken it from somebody else.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences
p17
aVof a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close \u2014
p18
aVthat my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all
p19
aVor walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building,
p20
aVwas that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written.
p21
aVBecause so much of that book was a celebration of the power
p22
aVand creative potential of density, of largely urban density,
p23
aVof connecting people and putting them together in one place,
p24
aVand putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas
p25
aVand share physical space together.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd it seemed to me looking at that \u2014 that tower burning and then falling,
p28
aVthose towers burning and falling \u2014 that in fact, one of the lessons
p29
aVhere was that density kills.
p30
aVAnd that of all the technologies that were exploited
p31
aVto make that carnage come into being,
p32
aVprobably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives
p33
aVwere those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings
p34
aV110 stories above the ground.
p35
aVIf they hadn't been crowded \u2014
p36
aVyou compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers,
p37
aVand you can see that very powerfully.
p38
aVAnd so I started to think, well, you know, density, density \u2014
p39
aVI'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days.
p42
aVAnd then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit,
p43
aVand you could sense that the air was not healthy.
p44
aVAnd so even though there were no cars still in the West Village
p45
aVwhere we lived, my wife sent me out to buy a, you know,
p46
aVa large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond,
p47
aVwhich was located about 20 blocks away, north.
p48
aVAnd so I went out.
p49
aVAnd obviously I'm physically a very strong person, as you can tell \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p50
aVso I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks.
p51
aVAnd I walked out, and this really miraculous thing happened to me
p52
aVas I was walking north to buy this air filter,
p53
aVwhich was that the streets were completely alive with people.
p54
aa(lp55
VThere was an incredible \u2014 it was, you know, a beautiful day,
p56
aVas it was for about a week after,
p57
aVand the West Village had never seemed more lively.
p58
aVI walked up along Hudson Street \u2014
p59
aVwhere Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book
p60
aVthat so influenced what I was writing in "Emergence" \u2014
p61
aVpast the White Horse Tavern,
p62
aVthat great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death,
p63
aVand the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids.
p64
aVAnd all the people who lived in the neighborhood,
p65
aVwho owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood,
p66
aVwere all out there \u2014 had them all open.
p67
aVPeople were out.
p68
aVThere were no cars, so it seemed even better, in some ways.
p69
aVAnd it was a beautiful urban day,
p70
aVand the incredible thing about it was that the city was working.
p71
aVThe city was there.
p72
aVAll the things that make a great city successful
p73
aVand all the things that make a great city stimulating \u2014
p74
aVthey were all on display there on those streets.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd I thought, well, this is the power of a city.
p77
aVI mean, the power of the city \u2014
p78
aVwe talked about cities as being centralized in space,
p79
aVbut what makes them so strong most of the time
p80
aVis they're decentralized in function.
p81
aVThey don't have a center executive branch that you can take out
p82
aVand cause the whole thing to fail.
p83
aVIf they did, it probably was right there at Ground Zero.
p84
aVI mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there,
p85
aVwas destroyed by the attacks,
p86
aVand obviously the damage done to the building and the lives.
p87
aVBut nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later,
p88
aVthe city had never looked more alive.
p89
aVIf you'd gone into the minds of the people,
p90
aVwell, you would have seen a lot of trauma,
p91
aVand you would have seen a lot of heartache,
p92
aVand you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut the system itself of this city was thriving.
p95
aVSo I took heart in seeing that.
p96
aVSo I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well,
p97
aVand how some of those reasons kind of map
p98
aVon to where the Web is going right now.
p99
aVThe question that I found myself asking to people
p100
aVwhen I was talking about the book afterwards is \u2014
p101
aVwhen you've talked about emergent behavior,
p102
aVwhen you've talked about collective intelligence,
p103
aVthe best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that
p104
aVis to ask, who builds a neighborhood?
p105
aVWho decides that Soho should have this personality
p106
aVand that the Latin Quarter should have this personality?
p107
aVWell, there are some kind of executive decisions,
p108
aVbut mostly the answer is \u2014 everybody and nobody.
p109
aVEverybody contributes a little bit.
p110
aVNo single person is really the ultimate actor
p111
aVbehind the personality of a neighborhood.
p112
aa(lp113
VSame thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive
p114
aVpost-9/11 in my neighborhood?
p115
aVWell, it was the whole city.
p116
aVThe whole system kind of working on it,
p117
aVand everybody contributing a small little part.
p118
aVAnd this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web
p119
aVin a bunch of interesting ways \u2014
p120
aVmost of which weren't around, actually,
p121
aVexcept in very experimental things,
p122
aVwhen I was writing "Emergence" and when the book came out.
p123
aVSo it's been a very optimistic time, I think,
p124
aVand I want to just talk about a few of those things.
p125
aVI think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity
p126
aVthat's starting to emerge online right now.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd the old one looked like this.
p129
aVThis is not the future King of England, although it looks like it.
p130
aVIt's some guy, it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online
p131
aVwho's interested, if you look at the bottom, in soccer and Jesus
p132
aVand Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and "my hometown" \u2014 those are his links.
p133
aVBut nothing really says
p134
aVthis model of interactivity \u2014 which was so exciting and captures the real,
p135
aVthe Web Zeitgeist of 1995 \u2014 than
p136
aV"Click here for a picture of my dog."
p137
aVThat is \u2014 you know, there's no sentence
p138
aVthat kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think,
p139
aVwhich is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog
p140
aVand link to it, and somebody reading the page
p141
aVhas the power to click on that link or not click on that link.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd, you know, I don't want to belittle that. That, in a sense \u2014
p144
aVto reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday \u2014
p145
aVthat was, in a sense, the kind of interface electricity that
p146
aVpowered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web:
p147
aVthat you could put up a link, and somebody could click on it,
p148
aVand it could take you anywhere you wanted to go.
p149
aVBut it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship.
p150
aVThere's one person putting up the link, and there's another person
p151
aVon the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not.
p152
aVThe new model is much more like this,
p153
aVand we've already seen a couple of references to this.
p154
aVThis is what happens when you search "Steven Johnson" on Google.
p155
aVAbout two months ago, I had the great breakthrough \u2014
p156
aVone of my great, kind of shining achievements \u2014
p157
aVwhich is that my website finally became a top result for "Steven Johnson."
p158
aVThere's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson
p159
aVwho has dropped two spots, I'm happy to say.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd, you know, I mean, I'll look at a couple of things like this,
p164
aVbut Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing.
p165
aVIt's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze.
p166
aVBecause effectively, what's happening here,
p167
aVwhat's creating this page, obviously \u2014 and we all know this,
p168
aVbut it's worth just thinking about it \u2014
p169
aVis not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson,
p170
aVbut rather somehow the entire web of people
p171
aVputting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it,
p172
aVand Google just sitting there and running the numbers.
p173
aVSo there's this collective decision-making that's going on.
p174
aVThis page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web,
p175
aVand Google is just helping us
p176
aVkind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, they're more innovative \u2014 well, Google's pretty innovative \u2014
p179
aVbut there are some new twists on this.
p180
aVThere's this incredibly interesting new site \u2014 Technorati \u2014
p181
aVthat's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these.
p182
aVAnd these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs.
p183
aVHe's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking.
p184
aVAnd he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs,
p185
aVand so you have kind of an authority \u2014
p186
aVa weblog that has a lot of links to it
p187
aVis more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it.
p188
aVAnd so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually,
p189
aVyou can say, what does the weblog community think about this page?
p190
aVAnd you can get a list.
p191
aVThis is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority.
p192
aVYou can also rank it by the latest posts.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo when I was talking in "Emergence,"
p195
aVI talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture
p196
aVthat, basically, you could link to somebody else
p197
aVbut they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.
p198
aVAnd that was one of the reasons why the web
p199
aVwasn't quite as emergent as it could be
p200
aVbecause you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism
p201
aVto be able to really do interesting things.
p202
aVWell, something like Technorati is supplying that.
p203
aVNow what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger,
p204
aVwhere he talks about everything being purposive in the Web \u2014
p205
aVthere's nothing artificial.
p206
aVHe has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there,
p207
aVif you see a link, somebody decided to put it there.
p208
aVAnd he says, the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page "like a tree fungus."
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore.
p211
aVI could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati
p212
aVon the right-hand side of my page,
p213
aVand they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes.
p214
aVThat little list there would change.
p215
aVI wouldn't really be directly in control of it.
p216
aVSo it's much closer, in a way, to a data fungus, in a sense,
p217
aVwrapped around that page, than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there.
p218
aVNow, what you're having here is basically a global brain
p219
aVthat you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking.
p220
aVAnd there are all these interesting tools.
p221
aVGoogle does the Google Zeitgeist,
p222
aVwhich looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in,
p223
aVand they publish it with lots of fun graphs.
p224
aVAnd I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google,
p225
aVso I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing.
p226
aa(lp227
VThere's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist,
p228
aVwhich is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching
p229
aVfor Britney Spears pictures, which is not necessarily news.
p230
aVThe Columbia blows up, suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia.
p231
aVWell, you know, we should expect to see that.
p232
aVThat's not necessarily something we didn't know already.
p233
aVSo the key thing in terms of these new tools
p234
aVthat are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain,
p235
aVthat are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream \u2014
p236
aVthe question is, are you finding out something new?
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share
p239
aVwhich is basically, you take an abstract term,
p240
aVand you search Google for that term,
p241
aVand then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name.
p242
aVSo basically, the number of pages that mention this term,
p243
aVthat also mention this page, the percentage of those pages
p244
aVis that person's Google Share of that term.
p245
aVSo you can do kind of interesting contests.
p246
aVLike for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference.
p247
aVSo Richard Saul Wurman
p248
aVhas about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference.
p249
aVOur good friend Chris has about a six percent \u2014 but with a bullet, I might add.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VBut the interesting thing is, you can broaden the search a little bit.
p254
aVAnd it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish.
p255
aVI had no idea.
p256
aVNo, that's not true.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVI made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide
p259
aVof the Mola mola fish.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VI also did \u2014 and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel \u2014
p264
aVbut I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection.
p265
aVSo right here \u2014 now this is a big category, you have smaller percentages,
p266
aVso this is 0.7 percent \u2014 Dan Dennett, who'll be speaking shortly.
p267
aVRight below him, 0.5 percent, Steven Pinker.
p268
aVSo Dennett's in the lead a little bit there.
p269
aVBut what's interesting is you can then broaden the search
p270
aVand actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there.
p271
aVSo Gary Bauer is not too far behind \u2014
p272
aVhas slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection.
p273
aVAnd right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So \u2014
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVyou can see we're in the ascot, which is always good.
p276
aVAnd by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel,
p277
aVI think, right there.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VHubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that,
p282
aVI think it would be good next year.
p283
aVAnother quick thing \u2014 this is a slightly different thing,
p284
aVbut this analysis some of you may have seen.
p285
aVIt just came out. This is bursty words,
p286
aVlooking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses.
p287
aVSo these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere,
p288
aVso they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off,
p289
aVthat didn't have a lot of historical precedent before.
p290
aVSo the first one is \u2014 these are the bursty words around 1860s \u2014
p291
aVslaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas.
p292
aVThat's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting.
p293
aVThey're talking about slavery in 1860.
p294
aV1935 \u2014 relief, depression, recovery banks.
p295
aVAnd OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well \u2014 that's pretty obvious.
p296
aV1985, right at the center of the Reagan years \u2014
p297
aVthat's, we're, there's, we've, it's.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VNow, there's one way to interpret this, which is to say that
p302
aV"emancipation" and "depression" and "recovery" all have a lot of syllables.
p303
aVSo you know, you can actually download \u2014 it's hard to remember those.
p304
aVBut seriously, actually, what you can see there,
p305
aVin a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise,
p306
aVis Reagan reinventing the political language of the country
p307
aVand shifting to a much more intimate, much more folksy, much more telegenic \u2014
p308
aVcontracting all those verbs.
p309
aVYou know, 20 years before it was still, "Ask not what you can do,"
p310
aVbut with Reagan, it's, "that's where, there's Nancy and I," that kind of language.
p311
aVAnd so something we kind of knew,
p312
aVbut you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing.
p313
aVI'll go very quickly.
p314
aVThe question now \u2014 and this is the really interesting question \u2014
p315
aVis, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now
p316
aVin the overall Web ecosystem \u2014 and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs
p317
aVbecause they are really kind of at the cutting edge.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system.
p320
aVNow there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky
p321
aVthat got a lot of attention about a month ago,
p322
aVand this is basically the distribution of links
p323
aVon the web to all these various different blogs.
p324
aVIt follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs,
p325
aVand a long tail of blogs with very few links.
p326
aVSo 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.
p327
aVNow this is a very interesting thing.
p328
aVIt's caused a lot of controversy
p329
aVbecause people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man,
p330
aVone modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd so the question is, "Why is this happening?"
p333
aVIt's not being imposed by fiat from above.
p334
aVIt's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now.
p335
aVNow, what's great about it is that people are working on \u2014
p336
aVwithin seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing
p337
aVthe underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing.
p338
aVAnd basically, the shape appears
p339
aVlargely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage.
p340
aVif you're the first site there, everybody links to you.
p341
aVIf you're the second site there, most people link to you.
p342
aVAnd so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links,
p343
aVand it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future,
p344
aVand then you get this kind of shape.
p345
aVAnd so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on,
p346
aVliterally as Shirky started \u2014 after he published his piece \u2014
p347
aVwas something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers.
p348
aVAnd he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links,
p349
aVthat suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices.
p352
aVSo he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system.
p353
aVAnd it creates a kind of planned emergence.
p354
aVYou're not totally in control,
p355
aVbut you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways
p356
aVbecause you have an end result which is
p357
aVmaybe a more democratic spread of voices.
p358
aVSo the most amazing thing about this \u2014 and I'll end on this note \u2014
p359
aVis, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems
p360
aVare not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern
p361
aVand changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not.
p362
aVSo the most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate
p363
aVabout power laws and software that could change it
p364
aVis the fact that we're having the conversation.
p365
aVI hope it continues here.
p366
aVThanks a lot.

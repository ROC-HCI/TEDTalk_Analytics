VI grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me
p5
aVwhen I was between seven and 10 years old.
p6
aVAnd I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew
p7
aVwere able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them \u2014
p8
aVhow few of them could even resemble a normal, contented,
p9
aVsatisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security
p10
aVwas destroyed by the war.
p11
aVSo I became interested in understanding
p12
aVwhat contributed to a life that was worth living.
p13
aVAnd I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy
p14
aVand to get involved in art and religion and many other ways
p15
aVthat I could see as a possible answer to that question.
p16
aVAnd finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.
p17
aa(lp18
VI was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money
p19
aVto actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and
p20
aVI didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the \u2014
p21
aVI read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation
p22
aVby someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich,
p23
aVand it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.
p24
aVAnd I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies,
p25
aVat least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.
p26
aVAnd the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.
p27
aVInstead of talking about little green men,
p28
aVhe talked about how the psyche of the Europeans
p29
aVhad been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting
p30
aVflying saucers into the sky.
p31
aVHe talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion
p32
aVwere kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain
p33
aVsome sense of order after the chaos of war.
p34
aVAnd this seemed very interesting to me.
p35
aVAnd I started reading his books after that lecture.
p36
aVAnd that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.
p37
aa(lp38
VThen I came to this country to study psychology
p39
aVand I started trying to understand the roots of happiness.
p40
aVThis is a typical result that many people have presented,
p41
aVand there are many variations on it.
p42
aVBut this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people
p43
aVsurveyed in the United States since 1956
p44
aVsay that their life is very happy.
p45
aVAnd that hasn't changed at all.
p46
aVWhereas the personal income,
p47
aVon a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,
p48
aVhas more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.
p49
aVBut you find essentially the same results,
p50
aVnamely, that after a certain basic point \u2014 which corresponds more or less
p51
aVto just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level \u2014
p52
aVincreases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.
p53
aVIn fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources,
p54
aVmaterial resources, contributes to unhappiness,
p55
aVbut the increase in material resources does not increase happiness.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo my research has been focused more on \u2014
p58
aVafter finding out these things that actually corresponded
p59
aVto my own experience, I tried to understand:
p60
aVwhere \u2014 in everyday life, in our normal experience \u2014
p61
aVdo we feel really happy?
p62
aVAnd to start
p63
aVthose studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people \u2014
p64
aVfirst artists and scientists, and so forth \u2014 trying to understand
p65
aVwhat made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life
p66
aVdoing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune,
p67
aVbut which made their life meaningful and worth doing.
p68
aa(lp69
VThis was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.
p70
aVAnd the interview was 40 pages long.
p71
aVBut this little excerpt is a very good summary
p72
aVof what he was saying during the interview.
p73
aVAnd it describes how he feels when composing is going well.
p74
aVAnd he says by describing it as an ecstatic state.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, "ecstasy" in Greek meant
p77
aVsimply to stand to the side of something.
p78
aVAnd then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state
p79
aVwhere you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.
p80
aVSo ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.
p81
aVAnd it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about
p82
aVthe civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement \u2014
p83
aVwhether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization,
p84
aVor the Mayas, or Egyptians \u2014 what we know about them
p85
aVis really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.
p86
aVWe know the temples they built, where people could come
p87
aVto experience a different reality.
p88
aVWe know about the circuses,
p89
aVthe arenas, the theaters.
p90
aVThese are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went
p91
aVto experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this,
p94
aVwhich is also \u2014 this place, this arena, which is built
p95
aVlike a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.
p96
aVWe are participating in a reality that is different
p97
aVfrom that of the everyday life that we're used to.
p98
aVBut this man doesn't need to go there.
p99
aVHe needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks,
p100
aVand as he does that, he can imagine sounds
p101
aVthat had not existed before in that particular combination.
p102
aVSo once he gets to that point of beginning to create,
p103
aVlike Jennifer did in her improvisation,
p104
aVa new reality \u2014 that is, a moment of ecstasy \u2014
p105
aVhe enters that different reality.
p106
aVNow he says also that this is so intense an experience
p107
aVthat it feels almost as if he didn't exist.
p108
aVAnd that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.
p109
aVBut actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing
p110
aVmore than about 110 bits of information per second.
p111
aVAnd in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,
p112
aVyou need to process about 60 bits per second.
p113
aVThat's why you can't hear more than two people.
p114
aVYou can't understand more than two people talking to you.
p115
aa(lp116
VWell, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process
p117
aVof creating something new, as this man is,
p118
aVhe doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor
p119
aVhow his body feels, or his problems at home.
p120
aVHe can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.
p121
aVHis body disappears,
p122
aVhis identity disappears from his consciousness,
p123
aVbecause he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,
p124
aVto really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,
p125
aVand at the same time to feel that he exists.
p126
aVSo existence is temporarily suspended.
p127
aVAnd he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.
p128
aVNow, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel
p129
aVany awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VSo what it's telling you here
p132
aVis that obviously this automatic,
p133
aVspontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone
p134
aVwho is very well trained and who has developed technique.
p135
aVAnd it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity
p136
aVthat you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years
p137
aVof technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field.
p138
aVWhether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long
p139
aVto be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better
p140
aVthan what was there before.
p141
aVNow, when that happens,
p142
aVhe says the music just flows out.
p143
aVAnd because all of these people I started interviewing \u2014
p144
aVthis was an interview which is over 30 years old \u2014
p145
aVso many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow
p146
aVthat I called this type of experience the "flow experience."
p147
aVAnd it happens in different realms.
p148
aa(lp149
VFor instance, a poet describes it in this form.
p150
aVThis is by a student of mine who interviewed
p151
aVsome of the leading writers and poets in the United States.
p152
aVAnd it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling
p153
aVthat you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.
p154
aVThis poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky \u2014
p155
aVa very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave
p156
aVas to how he imagined the forces of relativity,
p157
aVwhen he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.
p158
aVBut it happens in other activities.
p159
aVFor instance, this is another student of mine,
p160
aVSusan Jackson from Australia, who did work
p161
aVwith some of the leading athletes in the world.
p162
aVAnd you see here in this description of an Olympic skater,
p163
aVthe same essential description of the phenomenology
p164
aVof the inner state of the person.
p165
aVYou don't think; it goes automatically,
p166
aVif you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.
p167
aa(lp168
VIt happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote,
p169
aVcalled "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs
p170
aVwho had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful
p171
aVand very ethical, very socially responsible.
p172
aVYou see that these people define success
p173
aVas something that helps others and at the same time
p174
aVmakes you feel happy as you are working at it.
p175
aVAnd like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,
p176
aVyou can't have just one of these things be successful
p177
aVif you want a meaningful and successful job.
p178
aVAnita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.
p179
aVShe is the founder of Body Shop,
p180
aVthe natural cosmetics king.
p181
aVIt's kind of a passion that comes
p182
aVfrom doing the best and having flow while you're working.
p183
aa(lp184
VThis is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka,
p185
aVwho was at that time starting out Sony without any money,
p186
aVwithout a product \u2014 they didn't have a product,
p187
aVthey didn't have anything, but they had an idea.
p188
aVAnd the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers
p189
aVcan feel the joy of technological innovation,
p190
aVbe aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.
p191
aVI couldn't improve on this as a good example
p192
aVof how flow enters the workplace.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, when we do studies \u2014
p195
aVwe have, with other colleagues around the world,
p196
aVdone over 8,000 interviews of people \u2014 from Dominican monks,
p197
aVto blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds \u2014
p198
aVwho enjoy their work.
p199
aVAnd regardless of the culture,
p200
aVregardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions
p201
aVthat seem to be there when a person is in flow.
p202
aVThere's this focus that, once it becomes intense,
p203
aVleads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:
p204
aVyou know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;
p205
aVyou get immediate feedback.
p206
aVYou know that what you need to do
p207
aVis possible to do, even though difficult,
p208
aVand sense of time disappears, you forget yourself,
p209
aVyou feel part of something larger.
p210
aVAnd once the conditions are present,
p211
aVwhat you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.
p212
aa(lp213
VIn our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.
p214
aVAnd we can measure this very precisely, actually,
p215
aVbecause we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day,
p216
aVand whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel,
p217
aVwhere you are, what you're thinking about.
p218
aVAnd two things that we measure is the amount of challenge
p219
aVpeople experience at that moment and the amount of skill
p220
aVthat they feel they have at that moment.
p221
aVSo for each person we can establish an average,
p222
aVwhich is the center of the diagram.
p223
aVThat would be your mean level of challenge and skill,
p224
aVwhich will be different from that of anybody else.
p225
aVBut you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle.
p226
aa(lp227
VIf we know what that set point is,
p228
aVwe can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow,
p229
aVand it will be when your challenges are higher than average
p230
aVand skills are higher than average.
p231
aVAnd you may be doing things very differently from other people,
p232
aVbut for everyone that flow channel, that area there,
p233
aVwill be when you are doing what you really like to do \u2014
p234
aVplay the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work,
p235
aVif work is what provides flow for you.
p236
aVAnd then the other areas become less and less positive.
p237
aa(lp238
VArousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.
p239
aVYour skills are not quite as high as they should be,
p240
aVbut you can move into flow fairly easily
p241
aVby just developing a little more skill.
p242
aVSo, arousal is the area where most people learn from,
p243
aVbecause that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone
p244
aVand to enter that \u2014 going back to flow \u2014
p245
aVthen they develop higher skills.
p246
aVControl is also a good place to be,
p247
aVbecause there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.
p248
aVIt's not very challenging any more.
p249
aVAnd if you want to enter flow from control,
p250
aVyou have to increase the challenges.
p251
aVSo those two are ideal and complementary areas
p252
aVfrom which flow is easy to go into.
p253
aa(lp254
VThe other combinations of challenge and skill
p255
aVbecome progressively less optimal.
p256
aVRelaxation is fine \u2014 you still feel OK.
p257
aVBoredom begins to be very aversive
p258
aVand apathy becomes very negative:
p259
aVyou don't feel that you're doing anything,
p260
aVyou don't use your skills, there's no challenge.
p261
aVUnfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.
p262
aVThe largest single contributor to that experience
p263
aVis watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.
p264
aVEven though sometimes watching television
p265
aVabout seven to eight percent of the time is in flow,
p266
aVbut that's when you choose a program you really want to watch
p267
aVand you get feedback from it.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo the question we are trying to address \u2014 and I'm way over time \u2014
p270
aVis how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.
p271
aVAnd that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.
p272
aVAnd some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously
p273
aVwithout any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.
p274
aVAnd that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do.
p275
aa(lp276
VThank you.

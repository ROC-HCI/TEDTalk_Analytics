VI'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times.
p5
aVI review gadgets and stuff.
p6
aVAnd mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year
p7
aVis nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree.
p8
aVWhat I'm mostly doing this year
p9
aVis going on cable TV and answering the same question:
p10
aV"What are the tech trends for next year?"
p11
aVAnd I'm like, "Didn't we just go through this last year?"
p12
aa(lp13
VBut I'm going to pick the one that interests me most, and that is the
p14
aVcompleted marriage of the cell phone and the Internet.
p15
aVYou know, I found that volcano on Google Images,
p16
aVnot realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnyway, this all started a few years ago,
p21
aVwhen they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line,
p22
aVand we've come a long way since that.
p23
aVBut that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage.
p24
aVBasically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box
p25
aVthat they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.
p26
aVNow, it works just like a regular phone.
p27
aVSo you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone,
p28
aVbut its just a fake-out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone,
p29
aVjust to reassure you that the world hasn't ended.
p30
aVIt could be anything. It could be salsa music
p31
aVor a comedy routine \u2014 it doesn't matter.
p32
aVThe little box has your phone number.
p33
aVSo that's really cool \u2014 you can take it to London or Siberia,
p34
aVand your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring,
p35
aVbecause it's got everything in the box.
p36
aVThey've got every feature known to man in there,
p37
aVbecause adding a new feature is just software.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd as a result of Voice Over IP \u2014
p40
aVI hate that term \u2014 Voice Over Internet \u2014
p41
aVland-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years.
p42
aVI mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore.
p43
aVThis is what college kids are more likely to have. It's the most popular
p44
aVVOIP service in the world: It's Skype.
p45
aVIt's a free program you download for your Mac or PC,
p46
aVand you make free phone calls anywhere in the world
p47
aVThe downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd.
p48
aVIt's not your phone \u2014 it's your computer.
p49
aVBut nonetheless, if you're a college kid and you have no money,
p50
aVbelieve me, this is better than trying to use your cell phone.
p51
aa(lp52
VIt's really cute seeing middle-aged people
p53
aVlike me, try out Skype for the first time,
p54
aVwhich is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad.
p55
aVThey don't want to pay the international fees,
p56
aVso they're like, "Timmy! Is that you?"
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VIt's really cute.
p61
aVBut I \u2014 at least it was when I did it \u2014
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VI think where VOIP is really going to get interesting
p66
aVis when they start putting it on cell phones.
p67
aVImagine if you had an ordinary cell phone,
p68
aVand any time you were in a wireless hotspot \u2014
p69
aVfree calls anywhere in the world,
p70
aVnever pay the cellular company a nickel.
p71
aVIt'd be really, really cool \u2014 and yet,
p72
aVeven though the technology for this has been available
p73
aVfor five years, incredibly,
p74
aVthe number of standard cell phones
p75
aVoffered by US carriers with free VOIP
p76
aVis zero!
p77
aVI can't figure out why!
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VActually, I need to update that. There's one now.
p82
aVAnd it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it.
p83
aVIt comes from T-Mobile.
p84
aVAnd I am not paid by T-Mobile.
p85
aVI'm not plugging T-Mobile.
p86
aVThe New York Times has very rigid policies about that.
p87
aVEver since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VBasically, the reason you haven't heard about this program
p92
aVis because it was introduced last year
p93
aVon June 29.
p94
aVDoes anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year?
p95
aVIt was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day.
p96
aVI'm like, can you imagine being the
p97
aVT-Mobile PR lady? You know?
p98
aa(lp99
V"Hi, we have an announcement to \u2014 WAH!!!"
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VBut it's actually really, really cool. You have a choice of phones,
p104
aVand we're not talking smartphones \u2014
p105
aVordinary phones, including a Blackberry, that have Wi-Fi.
p106
aVThe deal is, any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot,
p107
aVall your calls are free.
p108
aVAnd when you're out of the hotspot, you're on the regular cellular network.
p109
aVYou're thinking, "Well, how often am I in a hotspot?"
p110
aVThe answer is, "All the time!"
p111
aVBecause they give you
p112
aVa regular wireless router that works with the phone,
p113
aVfor your house.
p114
aVWhich is really ingenious, because we all know that
p115
aVT-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier.
p116
aVThey have coverage like the size of my thumbnail.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVBut it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers. Right?
p119
aVThey don't have that kind of money. Instead they give each of us
p120
aVa seven-dollar-and-95-cent box. They're like a stealth tower installation program.
p121
aVWe're putting it in our homes for them!
p122
aa(lp123
VAnyway, they have Wi-Fi phones in Europe.
p124
aVBut the thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before
p125
aVis, when you're on a call an you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range,
p126
aVthe call is handed off in mid-syllable,
p127
aVseamlessly. I'll show you the advanced technologies
p128
aVwe use at the New York Times to test this gear.
p129
aVThis is me with a camcorder on a phone
p130
aVgoing like this.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VAs I walk out of the house from my Wi-Fi hotspot
p135
aVinto the cellular network on a call with my wife \u2014
p136
aVlook at the upper left. That's the Wi-Fi signal.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Video): Jennifer Pogue: Hello?
p139
aa(lp140
VDavid Pogue: Hi babes, it's me.
p141
aa(lp142
VJP: Oh, hi darling, how are you?
p143
aa(lp144
VDP: You're on Wi-Fi. How does it sound?
p145
aa(lp146
VJP: Oh, it sounds pretty good.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, I'm leaving the house. DP: I'm going for a walk \u2014 do you mind?
p149
aa(lp150
VJP: No not at all. I'm having a great day with the kids.
p151
aa(lp152
VDP: What are you guys doing?
p153
aa(lp154
VRight there!
p155
aVIt just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.
p156
aVI don't know why my wife says I never listen to her. I don't get that.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VThe bottom line is that the boundaries,
p161
aVbecause of the Internet plus cell phone, are melting.
p162
aVThe cool thing about the T-Mobile phones
p163
aVis that although switching technologies is very advanced,
p164
aVthe billing technology has not caught up.
p165
aVSo what I mean is that you can start a call
p166
aVin your house in the Wi-Fi hotspot,
p167
aVyou can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead \u2014
p168
aVwhich would be like 10 minutes \u2014
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd the call will continue to be free.
p173
aVBecause they don't, they haven't \u2014
p174
aVwell, no, wait! Not so fast.
p175
aVIt also works the other way.
p176
aVSo if you start a call on your cellular network
p177
aVand you come home, you keep being billed.
p178
aVWhich is why most people with this service
p179
aVget into the habit of saying,
p180
aV"Hey, I just got home. Can I call you right back?"
p181
aVNow you get it.
p182
aVIt's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas,
p183
aVit doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in.
p184
aVOn the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,
p185
aVright? Nobody knows you're in Pakistan.
p186
aVYou can make free unlimited calls
p187
aVhome to the US with these phones. So, very, very interesting.
p188
aa(lp189
VThis is another favorite of mine.
p190
aVDoes anyone here have a working cell phone
p191
aVthat's on, with coverage, who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing?
p192
aVOK. Would you call me please right now? [Phone number given.]
p193
aVAnd don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VI have two cell phones, so this going to be very odd, if it works.
p198
aVI should know not to do technology demos
p199
aVin front of an audience. It's just, like, absurd.
p200
aVThis one is going off. And \u2014 oh, I have the ringer off. Tsh! Great.
p201
aVAnyway, this one is also going off. So they're both ringing at the same time.
p202
aVExcuse me one second.
p203
aVHello?
p204
aVOh. Where are you calling from?
p205
aVNo, no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that.
p206
aVI didn't even know it was you \u2014 I was looking at this guy.
p207
aVOh great! Yeah. Yeah you can all stop calling now!
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VAll right! We've made the point.
p212
aVAll right. Ringer off. Everyone wants in on the action.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VSo this is Grand Central at work \u2014 it's a \u2014
p217
aVoh, for gods sake!
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VI have your numbers now!
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VYou will pay.
p226
aa(lp227
VGrand Central is this really brilliant idea
p228
aVwhere they give you a new phone number,
p229
aVand then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once.
p230
aVYour home phone, your work phone, your cell phone, your yacht phone
p231
aV(this is the EG crowd).
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VThe beauty of that is you never miss a call.
p236
aVI know a lot of you are like,
p237
aV"Ooh, I don't want to be reached at any hour."
p238
aVBut the beauty is it's all going through the internet,
p239
aVso you get all of these really cool features \u2014
p240
aVlike you can say, I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours.
p241
aVAnd I want these people to hear this greeting,
p242
aV"Hi boss, I'm out making us both some money. Leave a message."
p243
aVAnd then your wife calls, and, "Hi honey, leave me a message."
p244
aVVery, very customizable.
p245
aVGoogle bought it, and they've been working on it for a year.
p246
aVThey're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method.
p247
aa(lp248
VBy the way, this is something that really bothers me.
p249
aVI don't know if you realize this. When you call 411 on your cell phone,
p250
aVthey charge you two bucks.
p251
aVDid you know that? It's an outrage.
p252
aVI actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there.
p253
aVI'm going to tell you how to avoid that now.
p254
aVWhat you're going to use is Google Cellular.
p255
aVIt's totally free \u2014 there's not even ads.
p256
aVIf you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.
p257
aVI'm about to change your life. So here's me doing it.
p258
aVYou send a text message to the word "Google,"
p259
aVwhich turns out to be 46645.
p260
aVLeave off the last "e" for savings.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnyway, so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago.
p263
aVYou type "pharmacy Chicago," or the zip code.
p264
aVYou hit send, and in five seconds,
p265
aVthey will send you back the two closest drugstores,
p266
aVcomplete with name address and phone number.
p267
aVHere it comes.
p268
aVAnd it's already written down \u2014 so, like, if you're driving,
p269
aVyou don't have to do one of these things, "Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh."
p270
aa(lp271
VIt works with weather, too.
p272
aVYou can say "Weather," and the name of the city you're going to travel to.
p273
aVAnd then in five seconds, they send you back
p274
aVthe complete weather forecast for that town.
p275
aVShortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.
p276
aVHere we go. And those are just the beginning.
p277
aVThese are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will \u2014
p278
aVyeah! You're all trying to write this down.
p279
aVThat's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me.
p280
aVIt's absolutely phenomenal. The only downside
p281
aVis that it requires you to know how to text \u2014
p282
aVsend a text message. Nobody over 40 knows how to do that.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo I'm going to teach you something even better.
p285
aVThis is called Google Info.
p286
aVThey've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing.
p287
aVIt's speech recognition like you've never heard before.
p288
aVSo lets say I'm in Monterey,
p289
aVand I want what?
p290
aVI want to find what? Bagels. OK.
p291
aa(lp292
VGoogle: Say the business and the city and state.
p293
aa(lp294
VDP: Bagels, Monterey, California.
p295
aVI got the Chinese line.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VGoogle: Bagels, Monterey, California.
p300
aVTop eight results: Number one,
p301
aVBagel Bakery on El Dorado Street.
p302
aVTo select number one, you can press one or say "number one."
p303
aVNumber two: Bagel Bakery, commissary department.
p304
aa(lp305
VNumber Two. Number Two. Two.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VWhy do I listen to people in the audience?
p310
aVWell anyway \u2014 oh! Here we go!
p311
aa(lp312
VGoogle: ... commissary department on McClellan Avenue, Monterey.
p313
aVI'll connect you, or say "details," or "go back."
p314
aa(lp315
VDP: He's connecting me! He doesn't even tell me the phone number.
p316
aVHe's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet.
p317
aa(lp318
VGoogle: Hold on.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VDP: Hi, could I have 400 with a schmear?
p323
aVNo, no, no \u2014 just kidding, no no.
p324
aVSo anyway, you never even find out the number.
p325
aVIt's just so amazing.
p326
aVAnd it has incredible, incredible accuracy.
p327
aVThis is even more amazing. Put this in your speed dial.
p328
aVThis you can ask by voice any question.
p329
aVWho won the 1958 World Series?
p330
aVWhat's the recipe for a certain cocktail?
p331
aVIt's absolutely amazing \u2014 and they text you back the answer.
p332
aVI tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.
p333
aV"Which actors have played James Bond?"
p334
aVThey text me back this: "Sean Connery,
p335
aVGeorge Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig."
p336
aVRight! And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl.
p337
aVI'm like, "What's the word that means you know, like,
p338
aVwhen the sun, the moon and the earth are, like, all in a line?"
p339
aVJust to see how the recognition was.
p340
aVThey texted me back, "It's called a syzygy."
p341
aVWhich I knew, because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in 1976.
p342
aa(lp343
VYou know, there's a lot of people wondering, "How on earth are they going to
p344
aVmake money doing this?" And the answer is: look at the last line.
p345
aVThey put this teeny-weeny little ad, about 10 characters long.
p346
aVAnd a lot of people also want to know, "How does it work?
p347
aVHow can it be so good? It's as though there is a human being
p348
aVon the other end of the line."
p349
aVBecause there is one!
p350
aVThey have 10,000 people
p351
aVwho are being paid 20 cents per answer.
p352
aVAs you can imagine, it's college kids and old people.
p353
aVThat's who can afford to do that.
p354
aVBut it's a human being on the line. And it's gotten me out of so many
p355
aVtough positions like, "When's the last flight out of Chicago?"
p356
aVYou know. It's just absolutely amazing.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnother thing that really bothers me about cell phones today \u2014
p359
aVthis is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology.
p360
aVWhen I call to leave you a message,
p361
aVI get 15 seconds of instructions
p362
aVfrom a third-grade teacher on Ambien!
p363
aa(lp364
V(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
V"To page this person ... "
p367
aVPage? What is this, 1975?
p368
aVNobody has pagers anymore.
p369
aV"You may begin speaking at the tone.
p370
aVWhen you have finished recording,
p371
aVyou may hang up." No!
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VAnd then it gets worse:
p376
aVwhen I call to retrieve my messages,
p377
aVfirst of all: "You have 87 messages.
p378
aVTo listen to your messages ... "
p379
aVWhy else am I calling?
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VOf course I want to listen to the messages!
p384
aa(lp385
V(Laughter)
p386
aa(lp387
VOh! You all have cell phones too.
p388
aVSo last year I went to Milan, Italy,
p389
aVand I got to speak to an audience
p390
aVof cellular executives from 200 countries around the world.
p391
aVAnd I said as a joke \u2014 as a joke, I said,
p392
aV"I did the math. Verizon has 70 million customers.
p393
aVIf you check your voicemail twice a day,
p394
aVthat's 100 million dollars a year.
p395
aVI bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime, aren't you?"
p396
aVNo chuckle. They're like this \u2014
p397
aa(lp398
V(Laughter)
p399
aa(lp400
VWhere is the outrage, people? Rise up!
p401
aa(lp402
V(Laughter)
p403
aa(lp404
VSorry. I'm not bitter.
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
VSo now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that.
p409
aVThere are these services that transcribe
p410
aVyour voicemail into text.
p411
aVAnd they send it either to your email
p412
aVor as text messages to your phone.
p413
aVIt is a life-changer.
p414
aVAnd by the way, they don't always get the words right,
p415
aVbecause it's over the phone and all that.
p416
aVSo they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email
p417
aVso you can listen to double-check.
p418
aVThe services are called things like Spinvox,
p419
aVPhonetag \u2014 this is the one I use \u2014
p420
aVCallwave. A lot of people say, "How are they doing this?
p421
aVI don't really want people listening in to my calls."
p422
aVThe executives at these companies told me,
p423
aV"Well we use a proprietary B-to-B, best-of-breed, peer-to-peer soluti \u2014 " you know.
p424
aVI think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets, you know, listening in.
p425
aa(lp426
VThe reason I think that is that
p427
aVon the first day I tried one of these services,
p428
aVI got two voicemail messages. One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson,
p429
aVwhich shouldn't be that hard to transcribe, and it was misspelled.
p430
aVThe other was from my video producer at the Times, whose name is Vijaiy Singh,
p431
aVwith the silent 'h'. Nailed that one.
p432
aa(lp433
V(Laughter)
p434
aa(lp435
VSo you be the judge.
p436
aa(lp437
V(Laughter)
p438
aa(lp439
VAnyway, this service, Callwave, promises
p440
aVthat it's all software \u2014 nobody is listening to your messages.
p441
aVAnd they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist
p442
aVof your messages.
p443
aa(lp444
V(Laughter)
p445
aa(lp446
VSo I thought I'd see how that goes.
p447
aVThis is me testing it out.
p448

V(Video): Hello, this is Michael.
p450
aVHope you're doing well. I'm fine here. Everything's good.
p451
aVHey, I was walking along the street and the sky was blue.
p452
aVAnd your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice.
p453
aVI'm going to have a sandwich for lunch.
p454
aVShe's in room \u2014 emergency room 53W.
p455
aVOK, talk to you later \u2014 bye.
p456
aa(lp457
V(Laughter)
p458
aa(lp459
VI love my job.
p460
aa(lp461
V(Laughter)
p462
aa(lp463
VSo a couple minutes later, this I got by email.
p464
aVIt's a very good transcription. But a couple minutes after that,
p465
aVI got the text message version. Now remember,
p466
aVa text message can only be 160 characters long.
p467
aVSo it had better be the gist of the gist, right?
p468
aVI'm not kidding you. The message said,
p469
aa(lp470
V"Was walking along the street" and "sky was blue" and "emergency"!
p471
aa(lp472
V(Laughter)
p473
aa(lp474
VWhat the f \u2014 ?
p475
aa(lp476
V(Laughter)
p477
aa(lp478
VWell I guess that was the gist.
p479
aa(lp480
V(Laughter)
p481
aa(lp482
VAnd lastly, I just have to talk about this one.
p483
aVThis is my favorite of all time. It's called Popularitydialer.com.
p484
aVBasically, you're going to go on some
p485
aViffy date, or a potentially bad meeting.
p486
aVSo you go and you type in your phone number,
p487
aVand at the exact minute where you want to be called \u2014
p488
aa(lp489
V(Laughter)
p490
aa(lp491
VAnd at that moment your phone will ring.
p492
aVAnd you're like, "I'm sorry. I've got to take this."
p493
aVThe really beautiful thing is,
p494
aVyou know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can sort of
p495
aVhear a little bit of the caller.
p496
aVSo they give you a choice
p497
aVof what you want to hear on the other end.
p498
aVHere's the girlfriend.
p499
aa(lp500
VPhone: Hey you, what's going on?
p501
aa(lp502
VDP: I'm kinda, like, giving a talk right now.
p503
aa(lp504
VPhone: Well, that's good.
p505
aa(lp506
VDP: What are you doing?
p507
aa(lp508
VPhone: I was just wondering what you were up to.
p509
aa(lp510
VDP: Right, I can't really talk right now.
p511
aVThis is the \u2014 I love this \u2014 the boss call.
p512
aa(lp513
VPhone: Hey, this is Mr. Johnson calling from the office.
p514
aa(lp515
VDP: Oh, hi, sir.
p516
aa(lp517
VPhone: Did you complete that thing about a month ago? That photocopier training?
p518
aa(lp519
VDP: Oh \u2014 sorry I forgot.
p520
aa(lp521
VPhone: Yeah, well so when was the last time you used the photocopier?
p522
aa(lp523
VDP: It was like three weeks ago.
p524
aa(lp525
VPhone: Well, I don't know if you heard, you might have heard from Lenny, but \u2014
p526
aa(lp527
V(Laughter)
p528
aa(lp529
VI think the biggest change when Internet met phone
p530
aVwas with the iPhone.
p531
aVNot my finest moment in New York Times journalism.
p532
aVIt was when in the fall of 2006,
p533
aVI explained why Apple would never do a cell phone.
p534
aa(lp535
V(Laughter)
p536
aa(lp537
VI looked like a moron. However, my logic was good,
p538
aVbecause \u2014 I don't know if you realize this, but \u2014 until the iPhone came along,
p539
aVthe carriers \u2014 Verizon, AT&T, Cingular \u2014
p540
aVheld veto power over every aspect
p541
aVof every design of every phone.
p542
aVI know the people who worked on the Treo.
p543
aVThey went around to these carriers and said,
p544
aa(lp545
V"Look at these cool features." And Verizon is like, "Hmm, no.
p546
aVI don't think so."
p547
aVIt was not very conducive to innovation.
p548
aVWhat I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs
p549
aVwent around and said, "Tell you what \u2014 I'll give you a five-year exclusive
p550
aVif you'll let me design this phone in peace \u2014
p551
aVand you won't even see it till it's done."
p552
aVActually, even so, he was turned down by Verizon and others.
p553
aVFinally Cingular said OK.
p554
aa(lp555
VI'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone.
p556
aVPlease don't corner me at the party tonight
p557
aVand go, "What are you? An Apple fan boy?"
p558
aV- you know. I'm not.
p559
aVYou can see what I said about it. It's a flawed masterpiece.
p560
aVIt's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now.
p561
aa(lp562
VBut it did change a few things. The first thing it changed
p563
aVwas that all those carriers saw
p564
aVthat they sold 10 million of these things in a year.
p565
aVAnd they said, "Oh my gosh, maybe we've been doing it wrong.
p566
aVMaybe we should let phone designers design the phones."
p567
aa(lp568
V(Applause)
p569
aa(lp570
VAnother thing was that it let 10 million people,
p571
aVfor the first time, experience being online all the time.
p572
aVNot using these 60-dollar-a-month
p573
aVcellular cards for their laptops.
p574
aVI don't understand why we're not there yet.
p575
aVWhen I'm an old man, I'm going to tell my grandchildren,
p576
aV"When I was your age, if I wanted to check my email,
p577
aVI used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop. I did!"
p578
aa(lp579
V(Laughter)
p580
aa(lp581
V"We had wireless base stations that could
p582
aVbroadcast \u2014 yay, about 150 feet across."
p583
aa(lp584
V(Laughter)
p585
aa(lp586
VIt's absurd. We have power outlets
p587
aVin every room of every building. We have running water.
p588
aVWhat's the problem?
p589
aVAnyway \u2014 but this teaches people what it's like.
p590
aVYou have to go to YouTube
p591
aVand type in "iPhone Shuffle."
p592
aVThis guy did a mock video of one
p593
aVthat's one inch square, like the real iPod Shuffle.
p594
aVIt's like, "It only has one button.
p595
aVTouch it and it dials a number at random."
p596
aa(lp597
V(Laughter)
p598
aa(lp599
V"Who the hell is this?"
p600
aa(lp601
V(Laughter)
p602
aa(lp603
VBut the other thing it did
p604
aVis it opened up this idea of an app store.
p605
aVIt downloads right to the phone.
p606
aVAnd you can use the tilt sensor
p607
aVto steer this car using this game.
p608
aVThese programs can use all the components
p609
aVof the iPhone \u2014 the touch screen.
p610
aVThis is the Etch-A-Sketch program \u2014 the theme of EG 2008.
p611
aVYou know how you erase it?
p612
aVOf course. You shake it.
p613
aVRight, of course. We shake it to erase, like this.
p614
aa(lp615
VThey have 10,000 of these programs.
p616
aVThis is the translator program. They have every language in the world.
p617
aVYou type in what you want, and it gives you the translation.
p618
aVThis is amazing. This is Midomi.
p619
aVA song is running through your head \u2014
p620
aVyou sing it into the thing:
p621
aVdo do do do do, da da da da da da, da dum ...
p622
aVOK, you tap, "Done" and it will find out the song and play it for you.
p623
aVI know. It's insane, right?
p624
aa(lp625
VThis is Pandora. Free Internet radio. Not just free Internet radio \u2014
p626
aVyou type in a band or a song name.
p627
aVIt will immediately play you that song or that band.
p628
aVIt has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down.
p629
aVYou say if you like this song or not.
p630
aVIf you like it, it tries another song on you
p631
aVfrom a different band, with the same instrumentation, vocals,
p632
aVtheme and tempo.
p633
aVIf you like that one, or don't like it,
p634
aVyou do thumbs-up and thumbs-down. Over time it tailors the songs
p635
aVso that it completely stops playing bad songs.
p636
aVIt eventually only plays songs you like.
p637
aa(lp638
VThis is Urbanspoon. You're in a city. It knows from GPS where you're standing.
p639
aVYou want to find a place to eat. You shake it.
p640
aVIt proposes a restaurant.
p641
aVIt gives you the price, and the location and ratings.
p642
aVVideo: I'm not going all the way to Flushing.
p643
aVAnyway, just amazing, amazing things.
p644
aVOf course, its not just about the iPhone.
p645
aa(lp646
VThe iPhone broke the dyke, the wall.
p647
aVBut now it's everybody else. So Google has done their own Android operating system
p648
aVthat will soon be on handsets \u2014 phones from 34 companies.
p649
aVTouch screen \u2014 very, very nice.
p650
aVAlso with its own app store, where you can download programs.
p651
aa(lp652
VThis is amazing. In the wake of all this,
p653
aVVerizon, the most calcified, corporate,
p654
aVconservative carrier of all,
p655
aVsaid, "You can use any phone you want on our network."
p656
aVI love the Wired headline:
p657
aVPigs Fly, Hell Freezes Over
p658
aVand Verizon Opens Up Its Network \u2014 No. Really.
p659
aa(lp660
VSo everything is changing. We've entered
p661
aVa new world of innovation, where the cell phone becomes your laptop,
p662
aVcustomized the way you want it.
p663
aVEvery cell phone is unique. There is software that you can add on.
p664
aVCan I do one more one-minute song? Thank you.
p665
aa(lp666
V(Applause)
p667
aa(lp668
VJust to round it up \u2014 this is the new Apple Power Music Stand.
p669
aVIt's only three pounds,
p670
aVor 12 if you install Microsoft Office.
p671
aa(lp672
V(Laughter)
p673
aa(lp674
VSorry, that was mean.
p675
aVThis is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video.
p676
aVLadies and gentlemen, for seven blissful hours
p677
aVit was the number one video on YouTube.
p678
aV(To the tune of "My Way")
p679
aa(lp680
VAnd now the end is near.
p681
aVI'm sick to death
p682
aVof this old cell phone.
p683
aVBad sound, the signal's weak,
p684
aVthe software stinks.
p685
aVA made-in-Hell phone.
p686
aVI've heard there's something new \u2014
p687
aVa million times more rad than my phone.
p688
aVI too will join the cult.
p689
aVI want an iPhone.
p690
aVConcerns \u2014 I have a few. It's got some flaws;
p691
aVwe may just face it.
p692
aVNo keys, no memory card,
p693
aVthe battery's sealed \u2014
p694
aVyou can't replace it.
p695
aVBut God, this thing is sweet.
p696
aVA multitouch, iPod, Wi-Fi phone.
p697
aVYou had me from, "Hello."
p698
aVI want an iPhone.
p699
aVI want to touch its precious screen.
p700
aVI want to wipe the smudges clean.
p701
aVI want my friends to look and drool.
p702
aVI want to say, "Look \u2014 now I'm cool"
p703
aVI stood in line and I'll get mine.
p704
aVI want an iPhone.
p705
aVFor what is a man?
p706
aVWhat has he got? If not iPhone,
p707
aVthen he's got squat.
p708
aVIt's all the things a phone should be.
p709
aVWho cares if it's AT&T?
p710
aVI took a stand, paid half a grand!
p711
aVAnd I got an iPhone!
p712
aa(lp713
V(Applause)
p714
aa(lp715
VThank you. Thank you very much.

VEverybody in our society's life is touched by cancer \u2014
p5
aVif not personally,
p6
aVthen through a loved one, a family member,
p7
aVcolleague, friend.
p8
aVAnd once our lives are touched by cancer,
p9
aVwe quickly learn
p10
aVthat there are basically
p11
aVthree weapons, or three tools, that are available
p12
aVto fight the disease:
p13
aVsurgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
p14
aVAnd once we get involved
p15
aVin the therapeutic decisions,
p16
aVagain either personally
p17
aVor with our loved ones and family members,
p18
aVwe also very quickly learn
p19
aVthe benefits, the trade-offs and the limitations
p20
aVof these tools.
p21
aa(lp22
VI'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark
p23
aVand the TEDMED team
p24
aVfor inviting me today
p25
aVto describe a fourth tool, a new tool,
p26
aVthat we call Tumor Treating Fields.
p27
aVTumor Treating Fields
p28
aVwere invented by Dr. Yoram Palti,
p29
aVprofessor emeritus at the Technion in Israel.
p30
aVAnd they use low-intensity
p31
aVelectric fields
p32
aVto fight cancer.
p33
aVTo understand how Tumor Treating Fields work,
p34
aVwe first need to understand
p35
aVwhat are electric fields.
p36
aa(lp37
VLet me first address
p38
aVa few popular misconceptions.
p39
aVFirst of all, electric fields
p40
aVare not an electric current
p41
aVthat is coursing through the tissue.
p42
aVElectric fields
p43
aVare not ionizing radiation,
p44
aVlike X-rays or proton beams,
p45
aVthat bombard tissue
p46
aVto disrupt DNA.
p47
aVAnd electric fields
p48
aVare not magnetism.
p49
aVWhat electric fields are
p50
aVare a field of forces.
p51
aVAnd these forces
p52
aVact on, attract, bodies
p53
aVthat have an electrical charge.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe best way to visualize an electric field
p56
aVis to think of gravity.
p57
aVGravity is also a field of forces
p58
aVthat act on masses.
p59
aVWe can all picture astronauts in space.
p60
aVThey float freely in three dimensions
p61
aVwithout any forces acting on them.
p62
aVBut as that space shuttle
p63
aVreturns to Earth,
p64
aVand as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field,
p65
aVthey begin to see the effects of gravity.
p66
aVThey begin to be attracted towards Earth.
p67
aVAnd as they land,
p68
aVthey're fully aligned in the gravitational field.
p69
aVWe're, of course, all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now.
p70
aVThat's why you're all in your chairs.
p71
aVAnd that's why we have to use our muscle energy
p72
aVto stand up, to walk around
p73
aVand to lift things.
p74
aa(lp75
VIn cancer,
p76
aVcells rapidly divide
p77
aVand lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.
p78
aVWe can think of a cell
p79
aVfrom an electrical perspective
p80
aVas if it's a mini space station.
p81
aVAnd in that space station
p82
aVwe have the genetic material, the chromosomes,
p83
aVwithin a nucleus.
p84
aVAnd out in the cytoplasmic soup
p85
aVwe have special proteins
p86
aVthat are required for cell division
p87
aVthat float freely in this soup
p88
aVin three dimensions.
p89
aVImportantly, those special proteins
p90
aVare among the most highly charged objects
p91
aVin our body.
p92
aVAs cell division begins
p93
aVthe nucleus disintegrates,
p94
aVthe chromosomes line up
p95
aVin the middle of the cell
p96
aVand those special proteins
p97
aVundergo a three-dimensional sequence
p98
aVwhereby they attach
p99
aVand they literally click into place end-on-end
p100
aVto form chains.
p101
aVThese chains
p102
aVthen progress and attach
p103
aVto the genetic material
p104
aVand pull the genetic material
p105
aVfrom one cell into two cells.
p106
aVAnd this is exactly how
p107
aVone cancer cell becomes two cancer cells,
p108
aVtwo cancer cells become four cancer cells,
p109
aVand we have ultimately
p110
aVuncontrolled tumor growth.
p111
aa(lp112
VTumor Treating Fields
p113
aVuse externally placed transducers
p114
aVattached to a field generator
p115
aVto create an artificial electric field
p116
aVon that space station.
p117
aVAnd when that cellular space station
p118
aVis within the electric field,
p119
aVit acts on those highly charged proteins
p120
aVand aligns them.
p121
aVAnd it prevents them from forming those chains,
p122
aVthose mitotic spindles,
p123
aVthat are necessary to pull the genetic material
p124
aVinto the daughter cells.
p125
aVWhat we see is that the cells will attempt to divide
p126
aVfor several hours.
p127
aVAnd they will either enter into
p128
aVthis so-called cellular suicide,
p129
aVprogrammed cell death,
p130
aVor they will form unhealthy daughter cells
p131
aVand enter into apoptosis
p132
aVonce they have divided.
p133
aVAnd we can observe this.
p134
aa(lp135
VWhat I'm going to show you next
p136
aVare two in vitro experiments.
p137
aVThis is cultures, identical cultures,
p138
aVof cervical cancer cells.
p139
aVAnd we've stained these cultures
p140
aVwith a green florescent dye
p141
aVso that we can look at these proteins
p142
aVthat form these chains.
p143
aVThe first clip shows
p144
aVa normal cell division
p145
aVwithout the Tumor Treating Fields.
p146
aVWhat we see
p147
aVare, first of all, a very active culture,
p148
aVa lot of divisions,
p149
aVand then very clear nuclei
p150
aVonce the cells have separated.
p151
aVAnd we can see them dividing throughout.
p152
aVWhen we apply the fields \u2014
p153
aVagain, in the identical time-scale
p154
aVto the identical culture \u2014
p155
aVyou're going to see something different.
p156
aVThe cells round up for division,
p157
aVbut they're very static in that position.
p158
aVWe'll see two cells
p159
aVin the upper part of the screen
p160
aVattempting to divide.
p161
aVThe one within the circle manages.
p162
aVBut see how much of the protein
p163
aVis still throughout the nucleus,
p164
aVeven in the dividing cell.
p165
aVThe one up there can't divide at all.
p166
aVAnd then this bubbling, this membrane bubbling,
p167
aVis the hallmark
p168
aVof apoptosis in this cell.
p169
aa(lp170
VFormation of healthy mitotic spindles
p171
aVis necessary for division
p172
aVin all cell types.
p173
aVWe've applied Tumor Treating Fields
p174
aVto over 20 different cancers in the lab,
p175
aVand we see this effect
p176
aVin all of them.
p177
aVNow importantly,
p178
aVthese Tumor Treating Fields have no effect
p179
aVon normal undividing cells.
p180
aa(lp181
V10 years ago,
p182
aVDr. Palti founded a company called Novocure
p183
aVto develop his discovery
p184
aVinto a practical therapy for patients.
p185
aVIn that time, Novocure's developed two systems \u2014
p186
aVone system for cancers in the head
p187
aVand another system for cancers in the trunk of the body.
p188
aVThe first cancer that we have focused on
p189
aVis the deadly brain cancer, GBM.
p190
aVGBM affects about 10,000 people
p191
aVin the U.S. each year.
p192
aVIt's a death sentence.
p193
aVThe expected five year survival
p194
aVis less than five percent.
p195
aVAnd the typical patient
p196
aVwith optimal therapy
p197
aVsurvives just a little over a year,
p198
aVand only about seven months
p199
aVfrom the time that the cancer is first treated
p200
aVand then comes back and starts growing again.
p201
aa(lp202
VNovocure conducted
p203
aVits first phase three randomized trial
p204
aVin patients with recurrent GBM.
p205
aVSo these are patients
p206
aVwho had received surgery,
p207
aVhigh dose radiation to the head
p208
aVand first-line chemotherapy,
p209
aVand that had failed and their tumors had grown back.
p210
aVWe divided the patients into two groups.
p211
aVThe first group received second-line chemotherapy,
p212
aVwhich is expected to double the life expectancy,
p213
aVversus no treatment at all.
p214
aVAnd then the second group
p215
aVreceived only Tumor Treating Field therapy.
p216
aVWhat we saw in that trial
p217
aVis that that the life expectancies of both groups \u2014
p218
aVso the chemotherapy treated group
p219
aVand the Tumor Treating Field group \u2014
p220
aVwas the same.
p221
aVBut importantly,
p222
aVthe Tumor Treating Field group
p223
aVsuffered none of the side effects
p224
aVtypical of chemotherapy patients.
p225
aVThey had no pain,
p226
aVsuffered none of the infections.
p227
aVThey had no nausea, diarrhea,
p228
aVconstipation, fatigue
p229
aVthat would be expected.
p230
aa(lp231
VBased on this trial,
p232
aVin April of this year,
p233
aVthe FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields
p234
aVfor the treatment of patients
p235
aVwith recurrent GBM.
p236
aVImportantly, it was the first time ever
p237
aVthat the FDA included
p238
aVin their approval of an oncology treatment
p239
aVa quality of life claim.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo I'm going to show you now
p242
aVone of the patients
p243
aVfrom this trial.
p244
aVRobert Dill-Bundi
p245
aVis a famous Swiss cycling champion.
p246
aVHe won the gold medal in Moscow
p247
aVin the 4,000 meter pursuit.
p248
aVAnd five years ago,
p249
aVRobert was diagnosed with GBM.
p250
aVHe received the standard treatments.
p251
aVHe received surgery.
p252
aVHe received high dose radiation to the head.
p253
aVAnd he received first-line chemotherapy.
p254
aVA year after this treatment \u2014
p255
aVin fact, this is his baseline MRI.
p256
aVYou can see that the black regions
p257
aVin the upper right quadrant
p258
aVare the areas where he had surgery.
p259
aVAnd a year after that treatment,
p260
aVhis tumor grew back with a vengeance.
p261
aVThat cloudy white mass that you see
p262
aVis the recurrence of the tumor.
p263
aa(lp264
VAt this point, he was told by his doctors
p265
aVthat he had about 3 months to live.
p266
aVHe entered our trial.
p267
aVAnd here we can see him getting the therapy.
p268
aVFirst of all, these electrodes are noninvasive.
p269
aVThey're attached to the skin
p270
aVin the area of the tumor.
p271
aVHere you can see
p272
aVthat a technician is placing them on there much like bandages.
p273
aVThe patients learn to do this themselves
p274
aVAnd then the patients
p275
aVcan undergo all the activities of their daily life.
p276
aVThere's none of the tiredness.
p277
aVThere's none of what is called the "chemo head."
p278
aVThere's no sensation.
p279
aVIt doesn't interfere
p280
aVwith computers or electrical equipment.
p281
aVAnd the therapy is delivered continuously
p282
aVat home,
p283
aVwithout having to go into the hospital
p284
aVeither periodically or continually.
p285
aa(lp286
VThese are Robert's MRIs,
p287
aVagain, under only TTField treatment.
p288
aVThis is a therapy that takes time to work.
p289
aVIt's a medical device;
p290
aVit works when it's on.
p291
aVBut what we can see is, by month six,
p292
aVthe tumor has responded
p293
aVand it's begun to melt away.
p294
aVIt's still there.
p295
aVBy month 12,
p296
aVwe could argue whether
p297
aVthere's a little bit of material around the edges,
p298
aVbut it's essentially completely gone.
p299
aVIt's now five years
p300
aVsince Robert's diagnosis,
p301
aVand he's alive,
p302
aVbut importantly, he's healthy
p303
aVand he's at work.
p304
aVI'm going to let him, in this very short clip,
p305
aVdescribe his impressions of the therapy
p306
aVin his own words.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Video) Robert Dill-Bundi: My quality of life,
p309
aVI rate what I have today
p310
aVa bit different than what most people would assume.
p311
aVI am the happiest, the happiest person in the world.
p312
aVAnd every single morning I appreciate life.
p313
aVEvery night I fall asleep very well,
p314
aVand I am, I repeat,
p315
aVthe happiest man in the world,
p316
aVand I'm thankful I am alive.
p317
aa(lp318
VBD: Novocure's also working on lung cancer
p319
aVas the second target.
p320
aVWe've run a phase two trial
p321
aVin Switzerland
p322
aVon, again, recurrent patients \u2014
p323
aVpatients who have received standard therapy
p324
aVand whose cancer has come back.
p325
aVI'm going to show you another clip
p326
aVof a woman named Lydia.
p327
aVLydia's a 66 year-old farmer
p328
aVin Switzerland.
p329
aVShe was diagnosed with lung cancer
p330
aVfive years ago.
p331
aVShe underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy
p332
aVover two years,
p333
aVnone of which had an effect.
p334
aVHer cancer continued to grow.
p335
aVThree years ago,
p336
aVshe entered the Novocure lung cancer trial.
p337
aa(lp338
VYou can see, in her case,
p339
aVshe's wearing her transducer arrays,
p340
aVone of the front of her chest, one on the back,
p341
aVand then the second pair side-to-side over the liver.
p342
aVYou can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator,
p343
aVbut importantly you can also see that she is living her life.
p344
aVShe is managing her farm.
p345
aVShe's interacting with her kids and her grand kids.
p346
aVAnd when we talked to her,
p347
aVshe said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy,
p348
aVshe had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions.
p349
aVHer whole family suffered
p350
aVas her side effect profile came and went.
p351
aVNow she can run
p352
aVall of the activities of her farm.
p353
aVIt's only the beginning.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Applause)
p356
aa(lp357
VIn the lab, we've observed tremendous synergies
p358
aVbetween chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields.
p359
aVThere's research underway now at Harvard Medical School
p360
aVto pick the optimum pairs
p361
aVto maximize that benefit.
p362
aVWe also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation
p363
aVand interrupt the self-repair mechanisms that we have.
p364
aVThere's now a new research project underway
p365
aVat the Karolinska in Sweden
p366
aVto prove that hypothesis.
p367
aa(lp368
VWe have more trials planned
p369
aVfor lung cancer,
p370
aVpancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer
p371
aVand breast cancer.
p372
aVAnd I firmly believe
p373
aVthat in the next 10 years
p374
aVTumor Treating Fields
p375
aVwill be a weapon available to doctors and patients
p376
aVfor all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors.
p377
aVI'm also very hopeful
p378
aVthat in the next decades,
p379
aVwe will make big strides
p380
aVon reducing that death rate
p381
aVthat has been so challenging in this disease.
p382
aa(lp383
VThank you.

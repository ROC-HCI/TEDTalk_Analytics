VI'd like to talk today
p5
aVabout how we can change our brains
p6
aVand our society.
p7
aa(lp8
VMeet Joe.
p9
aVJoe's 32 years old and a murderer.
p10
aVI met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing
p11
aVat Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London.
p12
aVI'd like you to imagine this place.
p13
aVIt looks and feels like it sounds:
p14
aVWormwood Scrubs.
p15
aVBuilt at the end of the Victorian Era
p16
aVby the inmates themselves,
p17
aVit is where England's most dangerous prisoners are kept.
p18
aVThese individuals have committed acts
p19
aVof unspeakable evil.
p20
aVAnd I was there to study their brains.
p21
aVI was part of a team of researchers
p22
aVfrom University College London,
p23
aVon a grant from the U.K. department of health.
p24
aVMy task was to study a group of inmates
p25
aVwho had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths.
p26
aVThat meant they were the most
p27
aVcallous and the most aggressive
p28
aVof the entire prison population.
p29
aVWhat lay at the root of their behavior?
p30
aVWas there a neurological cause for their condition?
p31
aVAnd if there was a neurological cause,
p32
aVcould we find a cure?
p33
aa(lp34
VSo I'd like to speak about change, and  especially about emotional change.
p35
aVGrowing up, I was always intrigued
p36
aVby how people change.
p37
aVMy mother, a clinical psychotherapist,
p38
aVwould occasionally see patients at home
p39
aVin the evening.
p40
aVShe would shut the door to the living room,
p41
aVand I imagined
p42
aVmagical things happened in that room.
p43
aVAt the age of five or six
p44
aVI would creep up in my pajamas
p45
aVand sit outside with my ear glued to the door.
p46
aVOn more than one occasion, I fell asleep
p47
aVand they had to push me out of the way
p48
aVat the end of the session.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd I suppose that's how I found myself
p51
aVwalking into the secure interview room
p52
aVon my first day at Wormwood Scrubs.
p53
aVJoe sat across a steel table
p54
aVand greeted me with this blank expression.
p55
aVThe prison warden, looking equally indifferent,
p56
aVsaid, "Any trouble, just press the red buzzer,
p57
aVand we'll be around as soon as we can."
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VI sat down.
p61
aVThe heavy metal door slammed shut behind me.
p62
aVI looked up at the red buzzer
p63
aVfar behind Joe on the opposite wall.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VI looked at Joe.
p67
aVPerhaps detecting my concern,
p68
aVhe leaned forward, and said,
p69
aVas reassuringly as he could,
p70
aV"Ah, don't worry about the buzzer,
p71
aVit doesn't work anyway."
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VOver the subsequent months,
p75
aVwe tested Joe and his fellow inmates,
p76
aVlooking specifically at their ability
p77
aVto categorize different images of emotion.
p78
aVAnd we looked at their physical response
p79
aVto those emotions.
p80
aVSo, for example, when most of us look
p81
aVat a picture like this of somebody looking sad,
p82
aVwe instantly have a slight,
p83
aVmeasurable physical response:
p84
aVincreased heart rate, sweating of the skin.
p85
aVWhilst the psychopaths in our study were able
p86
aVto describe the pictures accurately,
p87
aVthey failed to show the emotions required.
p88
aVThey failed to show a physical response.
p89
aVIt was as though they knew the words
p90
aVbut not the music of empathy.
p91
aVSo we wanted to look closer at this
p92
aVto use MRI to image their brains.
p93
aVThat turned out to be not such an easy task.
p94
aVImagine transporting a collection
p95
aVof clinical psychopaths across central London
p96
aVin shackles and handcuffs
p97
aVin rush hour,
p98
aVand in order to place each of them in an MRI scanner,
p99
aVyou have to remove all metal objects,
p100
aVincluding shackles and handcuffs,
p101
aVand, as I learned, all body piercings.
p102
aa(lp103
VAfter some time, however, we had a tentative answer.
p104
aVThese individuals were not just the victims
p105
aVof a troubled childhood.
p106
aVThere was something else.
p107
aVPeople like Joe have a deficit in a brain area
p108
aVcalled the amygdala.
p109
aVThe amygdala is an almond-shaped organ
p110
aVdeep within each of the hemispheres of the brain.
p111
aVIt is thought to be key to the experience of empathy.
p112
aVNormally, the more empathic a person is,
p113
aVthe larger and more active their amygdala is.
p114
aVOur population of inmates
p115
aVhad a deficient amygdala,
p116
aVwhich likely led to their lack of empathy
p117
aVand to their immoral behavior.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo let's take a step back.
p120
aVNormally, acquiring moral behavior
p121
aVis simply part of growing up,
p122
aVlike learning to speak.
p123
aVAt the age of six months, virtually every one of us
p124
aVis able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects.
p125
aVAt the age of 12 months,
p126
aVmost children are able to imitate
p127
aVthe purposeful actions of others.
p128
aVSo for example, your mother raises her hands
p129
aVto stretch, and you imitate her behavior.
p130
aVAt first, this isn't perfect.
p131
aVI remember my cousin Sasha,
p132
aVtwo years old at the time,
p133
aVlooking through a picture book
p134
aVand licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand,
p135
aVlicking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVBit by bit, we build the foundations  of the social brain
p138
aVso that by the time we're three, four years old,
p139
aVmost children, not all,
p140
aVhave acquired the ability to understand
p141
aVthe intentions of others,
p142
aVanother prerequisite for empathy.
p143
aVThe fact that this developmental progression
p144
aVis universal,
p145
aVirrespective of where you live in the world
p146
aVor which culture you inhabit,
p147
aVstrongly suggests that the foundations
p148
aVof moral behavior are inborn.
p149
aVIf you doubt this,
p150
aVtry, as I've done, to renege on a promise you've made
p151
aVto a four-year-old.
p152
aVYou will find that the mind of a four-year old
p153
aVis not naïve in the slightest.
p154
aVIt is more akin to a Swiss army knife
p155
aVwith fixed mental modules
p156
aVfinely honed during development
p157
aVand a sharp sense of fairness.
p158
aVThe early years are crucial.
p159
aVThere seems to be a window of opportunity,
p160
aVafter which mastering moral questions
p161
aVbecomes more difficult,
p162
aVlike adults learning a foreign language.
p163
aVThat's not to say it's impossible.
p164
aVA recent, wonderful study from Stanford University
p165
aVshowed that people who have played
p166
aVa virtual reality game in which they took on
p167
aVthe role of a good and helpful superhero
p168
aVactually became more caring and helpful
p169
aVtowards others afterwards.
p170
aVNow I'm not suggesting
p171
aVwe endow criminals with superpowers,
p172
aVbut I am suggesting that we need to find ways
p173
aVto get Joe and people like him
p174
aVto change their brains and their behavior,
p175
aVfor their benefit
p176
aVand for the benefit of the rest of us.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo can brains change?
p179
aVFor over 100 years,
p180
aVneuroanatomists and later neuroscientists
p181
aVheld the view that after initial development in childhood,
p182
aVno new brain cells could grow
p183
aVin the adult human brain.
p184
aVThe brain could only change
p185
aVwithin certain set limits.
p186
aVThat was the dogma.
p187
aVBut then, in the 1990s,
p188
aVstudies starting showing,
p189
aVfollowing the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others,
p190
aVstudies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis,
p191
aVthe birth of new brain cells
p192
aVin the adult mammalian brain,
p193
aVfirst in the olfactory bulb,
p194
aVwhich is responsible for our sense of smell,
p195
aVthen in the hippocampus
p196
aVinvolving short-term memory,
p197
aVand finally in the amygdala itself.
p198
aVIn order to understand
p199
aVhow this process works,
p200
aVI left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford
p201
aVspecializing in learning and development.
p202
aVInstead of psychopaths, I studied mice,
p203
aVbecause the same pattern of brain responses
p204
aVappears across many different species of social animals.
p205
aVSo if you rear a mouse in a standard cage,
p206
aVa shoebox, essentially, with cotton wool,
p207
aValone and without much stimulation,
p208
aVnot only does it not thrive,
p209
aVbut it will often develop strange,
p210
aVrepetitive behaviors.
p211
aVThis naturally sociable animal
p212
aVwill lose its ability to bond with other mice,
p213
aVeven becoming aggressive when introduced to them.
p214
aVHowever, mice reared in what we called
p215
aVan enriched environment,
p216
aVa large habitation with other mice
p217
aVwith wheels and ladders and areas to explore,
p218
aVdemonstrate neurogenesis,
p219
aVthe birth of new brain cells,
p220
aVand as we showed, they also perform better
p221
aVon a range of learning and memory tasks.
p222
aVNow, they don't develop morality to the point of
p223
aVcarrying the shopping bags of little old mice
p224
aVacross the street,
p225
aVbut their improved environment results in healthy,
p226
aVsociable behavior.
p227
aVMice reared in a standard cage, by contrast,
p228
aVnot dissimilar, you might say, from a prison cell,
p229
aVhave dramatically lower levels of new neurons
p230
aVin the brain.
p231
aa(lp232
VIt is now clear that the amygdala of mammals,
p233
aVincluding primates like us,
p234
aVcan show neurogenesis.
p235
aVIn some areas of the brain,
p236
aVmore than 20 percent of cells are newly formed.
p237
aVWe're just beginning to understand
p238
aVwhat exact function these cells have,
p239
aVbut what it implies is that the brain is capable
p240
aVof extraordinary change way into adulthood.
p241
aVHowever, our brains are also
p242
aVexquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment.
p243
aVStress hormones, glucocorticoids,
p244
aVreleased by the brain,
p245
aVsuppress the growth of these new cells.
p246
aVThe more stress, the less brain development,
p247
aVwhich in turn causes less adaptability
p248
aVand causes higher stress levels.
p249
aVThis is the interplay between nature and nurture
p250
aVin real time in front of our eyes.
p251
aVWhen you think about it,
p252
aVit is ironic that our current solution
p253
aVfor people with stressed amygdalae
p254
aVis to place them in an environment
p255
aVthat actually inhibits any chance of further growth.
p256
aVOf course, imprisonment is a necessary part
p257
aVof the criminal justice system
p258
aVand of protecting society.
p259
aVOur research does not suggest
p260
aVthat criminals should submit their MRI scans
p261
aVas evidence in court
p262
aVand get off the hook because they've got a faulty amygdala.
p263
aVThe evidence is actually the other way.
p264
aVBecause our brains are capable of change,
p265
aVwe need to take responsibility for our actions,
p266
aVand they need to take responsibility
p267
aVfor their rehabilitation.
p268
aVOne way such rehabilitation might work
p269
aVis through restorative justice programs.
p270
aVHere victims, if they choose to participate,
p271
aVand perpetrators meet face to face
p272
aVin safe, structured encounters,
p273
aVand the perpetrator is encouraged
p274
aVto take responsibility for their actions,
p275
aVand the victim plays an active role in the process.
p276
aVIn such a setting, the perpetrator can see,
p277
aVperhaps for the first time,
p278
aVthe victim as a real person
p279
aVwith thoughts and feelings and a genuine
p280
aVemotional response.
p281
aVThis stimulates the amygdala
p282
aVand may be a more effective rehabilitative practice
p283
aVthan simple incarceration.
p284
aVSuch programs won't work for everyone,
p285
aVbut for many, it could be a way
p286
aVto break the frozen sea within.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo what can we do now?
p289
aVHow can we apply this knowledge?
p290
aVI'd like to leave you with
p291
aVthree lessons that I learned.
p292
aVThe first thing that I learned was that
p293
aVwe need to change our mindset.
p294
aVSince Wormwood Scrubs was built 130 years ago,
p295
aVsociety has advanced in virtually every aspect,
p296
aVin the way we run our schools, our hospitals.
p297
aVYet the moment we speak about prisons,
p298
aVit's as though we're back in Dickensian times,
p299
aVif not medieval times.
p300
aVFor too long, I believe,
p301
aVwe've allowed ourselves to be persuaded
p302
aVof the false notion that human  nature cannot change,
p303
aVand as a society, it's costing us dearly.
p304
aVWe know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change,
p305
aVand the best way to achieve that,
p306
aVeven in adults, is to change and modulate
p307
aVour environment.
p308
aa(lp309
VThe second thing I have learned
p310
aVis that we need to create an alliance
p311
aVof people who believe that science is integral
p312
aVto bringing about social change.
p313
aVIt's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place
p314
aVa high-security inmate in an MRI scanner.
p315
aVWell actually, that turns out not to be so easy,
p316
aVbut ultimately what we want to show
p317
aVis whether we're able to reduce the reoffending rates.
p318
aVIn order to answer complex questions like that,
p319
aVwe need people of different backgrounds \u2014
p320
aVlab-based scientists and clinicians,
p321
aVsocial workers and policy makers,
p322
aVphilanthropists and human rights activists \u2014
p323
aVto work together.
p324
aa(lp325
VFinally, I believe we need
p326
aVto change our own amygdalae,
p327
aVbecause this issue goes to the heart
p328
aVnot just of who Joe is,
p329
aVbut who we are.
p330
aVWe need to change our view of Joe
p331
aVas someone wholly irredeemable,
p332
aVbecause if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable,
p333
aVhow is he going to see himself as any different?
p334
aVIn another decade, Joe will be released
p335
aVfrom Wormwood Scrubs.
p336
aVWill he be among the 70 percent of inmates
p337
aVwho end up reoffending
p338
aVand returning to the prison system?
p339
aVWouldn't it be better if, while serving his sentence,
p340
aVJoe was able to train his amygdala,
p341
aVwhich would stimulate the growth of new brain cells
p342
aVand connections,
p343
aVso that he will be able to face the world
p344
aVonce he gets released?
p345
aVSurely, that would be in the interest of all of us.
p346
aa(lp347
V(Applause)
p348
aVThank you. (Applause)

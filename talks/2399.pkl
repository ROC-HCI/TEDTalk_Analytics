VWhat keeps us healthy and happy
p5
aVas we go through life?
p6
aVIf you were going to invest now
p7
aVin your future best self,
p8
aVwhere would you put your time and your energy?
p9
aVThere was a recent survey of millennials
p10
aVasking them what their most important life goals were,
p11
aVand over 80 percent said
p12
aVthat a major life goal for them was to get rich.
p13
aVAnd another 50 percent of those same young adults
p14
aVsaid that another major life goal
p15
aVwas to become famous.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder
p20
aVand achieve more.
p21
aVWe're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after
p22
aVin order to have a good life.
p23
aVPictures of entire lives,
p24
aVof the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,
p25
aVthose pictures are almost impossible to get.
p26
aVMost of what we know about human life
p27
aVwe know from asking people to remember the past,
p28
aVand as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.
p29
aVWe forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,
p30
aVand sometimes memory is downright creative.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut what if we could watch entire lives
p33
aVas they unfold through time?
p34
aVWhat if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers
p35
aVall the way into old age
p36
aVto see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
p37
aa(lp38
VWe did that.
p39
aVThe Harvard Study of Adult Development
p40
aVmay be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
p41
aVFor 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
p42
aVyear after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
p43
aVand of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
p44
aVwere going to turn out.
p45
aa(lp46
VStudies like this are exceedingly rare.
p47
aVAlmost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
p48
aVbecause too many people drop out of the study,
p49
aVor funding for the research dries up,
p50
aVor the researchers get distracted,
p51
aVor they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
p52
aVBut through a combination of luck
p53
aVand the persistence of several generations of researchers,
p54
aVthis study has survived.
p55
aVAbout 60 of our original 724 men
p56
aVare still alive,
p57
aVstill participating in the study,
p58
aVmost of them in their 90s.
p59
aVAnd we are now beginning to study
p60
aVthe more than 2,000 children of these men.
p61
aVAnd I'm the fourth director of the study.
p62
aa(lp63
VSince 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
p64
aVThe first group started in the study
p65
aVwhen they were sophomores at Harvard College.
p66
aVThey all finished college during World War II,
p67
aVand then most went off to serve in the war.
p68
aVAnd the second group that we've followed
p69
aVwas a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
p70
aVboys who were chosen for the study
p71
aVspecifically because they were from some of the most troubled
p72
aVand disadvantaged families
p73
aVin the Boston of the 1930s.
p74
aVMost lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhen they entered the study,
p77
aVall of these teenagers were interviewed.
p78
aVThey were given medical exams.
p79
aVWe went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
p80
aVAnd then these teenagers grew up into adults
p81
aVwho entered all walks of life.
p82
aVThey became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
p83
aVone President of the United States.
p84
aVSome developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
p85
aVSome climbed the social ladder
p86
aVfrom the bottom all the way to the very top,
p87
aVand some made that journey in the opposite direction.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe founders of this study
p90
aVwould never in their wildest dreams
p91
aVhave imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
p92
aVtelling you that the study still continues.
p93
aVEvery two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
p94
aVcalls up our men and asks them if we can send them
p95
aVyet one more set of questions about their lives.
p96
aa(lp97
VMany of the inner city Boston men ask us,
p98
aV"Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting."
p99
aVThe Harvard men never ask that question.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VTo get the clearest picture of these lives,
p104
aVwe don't just send them questionnaires.
p105
aVWe interview them in their living rooms.
p106
aVWe get their medical records from their doctors.
p107
aVWe draw their blood, we scan their brains,
p108
aVwe talk to their children.
p109
aVWe videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
p110
aVAnd when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
p111
aVif they would join us as members of the study,
p112
aVmany of the women said, "You know, it's about time."
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VSo what have we learned?
p117
aVWhat are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
p118
aVof information that we've generated
p119
aVon these lives?
p120
aVWell, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
p121
aVThe clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
p122
aVGood relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
p123
aa(lp124
VWe've learned three big lessons about relationships.
p125
aVThe first is that social connections are really good for us,
p126
aVand that loneliness kills.
p127
aVIt turns out that people who are more socially connected
p128
aVto family, to friends, to community,
p129
aVare happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
p130
aVthan people who are less well connected.
p131
aVAnd the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
p132
aVPeople who are more isolated than they want to be from others
p133
aVfind that they are less happy,
p134
aVtheir health declines earlier in midlife,
p135
aVtheir brain functioning declines sooner
p136
aVand they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
p137
aVAnd the sad fact is that at any given time,
p138
aVmore than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
p141
aVand you can be lonely in a marriage,
p142
aVso the second big lesson that we learned
p143
aVis that it's not just the number of friends you have,
p144
aVand it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
p145
aVbut it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
p146
aVIt turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
p147
aVHigh-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
p148
aVturn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
p149
aVAnd living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
p150
aa(lp151
VOnce we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
p152
aVwe wanted to look back at them at midlife
p153
aVand to see if we could predict
p154
aVwho was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
p155
aVand who wasn't.
p156
aVAnd when we gathered together everything we knew about them
p157
aVat age 50,
p158
aVit wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
p159
aVthat predicted how they were going to grow old.
p160
aVIt was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
p161
aVThe people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
p162
aVwere the healthiest at age 80.
p163
aVAnd good, close relationships seem to buffer us
p164
aVfrom some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
p165
aVOur most happily partnered men and women
p166
aVreported, in their 80s,
p167
aVthat on the days when they had more physical pain,
p168
aVtheir mood stayed just as happy.
p169
aVBut the people who were in unhappy relationships,
p170
aVon the days when they reported more physical pain,
p171
aVit was magnified by more emotional pain.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
p174
aVis that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
p175
aVthey protect our brains.
p176
aVIt turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
p177
aVto another person in your 80s is protective,
p178
aVthat the people who are in relationships
p179
aVwhere they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
p180
aVthose people's memories stay sharper longer.
p181
aVAnd the people in relationships
p182
aVwhere they feel they really can't count on the other one,
p183
aVthose are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
p184
aVAnd those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
p185
aVSome of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
p186
aVday in and day out,
p187
aVbut as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
p188
aVwhen the going got tough,
p189
aVthose arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo this message,
p192
aVthat good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
p193
aVthis is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
p194
aVWhy is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
p195
aVWell, we're human.
p196
aVWhat we'd really like is a quick fix,
p197
aVsomething we can get
p198
aVthat'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
p199
aVRelationships are messy and they're complicated
p200
aVand the hard work of tending to family and friends,
p201
aVit's not sexy or glamorous.
p202
aVIt's also lifelong. It never ends.
p203
aVThe people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
p204
aVwere the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
p205
aVJust like the millennials in that recent survey,
p206
aVmany of our men when they were starting out as young adults
p207
aVreally believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
p208
aVwere what they needed to go after to have a good life.
p209
aVBut over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
p210
aVthat the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
p211
aVwith family, with friends, with community.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo what about you?
p214
aVLet's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
p215
aVWhat might leaning in to relationships even look like?
p216
aa(lp217
VWell, the possibilities are practically endless.
p218
aVIt might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
p219
aVor livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
p220
aVlong walks or date nights,
p221
aVor reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
p222
aVbecause those all-too-common family feuds
p223
aVtake a terrible toll
p224
aVon the people who hold the grudges.
p225
aa(lp226
VI'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
p227
aVMore than a century ago,
p228
aVhe was looking back on his life,
p229
aVand he wrote this:
p230
aV"There isn't time, so brief is life,
p231
aVfor bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
p232
aVThere is only time for loving,
p233
aVand but an instant, so to speak, for that."
p234
aa(lp235
VThe good life is built with good relationships.
p236
aa(lp237
VThank you.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)

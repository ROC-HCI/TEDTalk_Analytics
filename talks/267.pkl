VA few words about how I got started,
p5
aVand it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.
p6
aVWhen I was a very young child, I was extremely introverted
p7
aVand very much to myself.
p8
aVAnd, kind of as a way of surviving,
p9
aVI would go into my own very personal space,
p10
aVand I would make things.
p11
aVI would make things for people
p12
aVas a way of, you know, giving, showing them my love.
p13
aVI would go into these private places,
p14
aVand I would put my ideas and my passions into objects \u2014
p15
aVand sort of learning how to speak with my hands.
p16
aVSo, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects
p17
aVis very much connected with not only the idea realm,
p18
aVbut also with very much the feeling realm.
p19
aVAnd the ideas are very disparate.
p20
aa(lp21
VI'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces,
p22
aVand there's no real connection between one or the other,
p23
aVexcept that they sort of come out of my brain,
p24
aVand they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered
p25
aVby looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects,
p26
aVand just having kind of playful random thoughts about things.
p27
aa(lp28
VWhen I was a child, I started to explore motion.
p29
aVI fell in love with the way things moved,
p30
aVso I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.
p31
aVAnd this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade,
p32
aVand I remember when I was doing this,
p33
aVI was thinking about that little rock there,
p34
aVand the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air,
p35
aVand how the characters \u2014
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter) \u2014
p38
aa(lp39
Vwould come shooting out of the car,
p40
aVso, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles.
p41
aVAnd of course, when you're a little kid, there's always destruction.
p42
aVSo, it has to end with this \u2014
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter) \u2014
p45
aa(lp46
Vgratuitous violence.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VSo that was how I first started to explore the way things moved,
p51
aVand expressed it.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, when I went to college,
p54
aVI found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines.
p55
aVAnd this really came about
p56
aVfrom having many different kinds of interests.
p57
aVWhen I was in high school, I loved to program computers,
p58
aVso I sort of liked the logical flow of events.
p59
aVI was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery
p60
aVand becoming a surgeon,
p61
aVbecause it meant working with my hands
p62
aVin a very focused, intense way.
p63
aVSo, I started taking art courses,
p64
aVand I found a way to make sculpture
p65
aVthat brought together my love for being very precise with my hands,
p66
aVwith coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system.
p67
aVAnd also, working with wire \u2014 everything that I did
p68
aVwas both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision
p69
aVat the same time.
p70
aVSo, I was able to sort of exercise all of that.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.
p73
aVAnd it's full of many little trivial end points,
p74
aVlike there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles
p75
aVand it doesn't really mean anything.
p76
aVIt's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality.
p77
aVThe connection I have with engineering
p78
aVis the same as any other engineer, in that I love to solve problems.
p79
aVI love to figure things out,
p80
aVbut the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VThat's pretty ambiguous.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VThe next piece that is going to come up
p89
aVis an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.
p90
aVI gave myself the problem.
p91
aVSince I'm always liking to solve problems,
p92
aVI gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction,
p93
aVand solving all of the mechanical problems
p94
aVfor getting this little man to walk back and forth.
p95
aVSo, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine,
p96
aVbut I did have a sense of the gesture,
p97
aVand a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space.
p98
aVAnd then it was a matter of starting from one point
p99
aVand sort of building to that final point.
p100
aVThat little gear there switches back and forth to change direction.
p101
aVAnd that's a little found object.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo a lot of the pieces that I've made,
p104
aVthey involve found objects.
p105
aVAnd it really \u2014 it's almost like doing visual puns all the time.
p106
aVWhen I see objects, I imagine them in motion.
p107
aVI imagine what can be said with them.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis next one here, "Machine with Wishbone,"
p110
aVit came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.
p111
aVYou know, they say, never play with your food \u2014
p112
aVbut I always play with things.
p113
aVSo, I had this wishbone, and I thought,
p114
aVit's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd I started to make him walk across the table,
p119
aVand I thought, "Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that."
p120
aVSo, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks.
p121
aVAnd because the wishbone is bone \u2014 it's animal \u2014
p122
aVit's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it.
p123
aVAnd that's the whole piece.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VThat's about that big.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VThis kind of work is also very much like puppetry,
p132
aVwhere the found object is, in a sense, the puppet,
p133
aVand I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object.
p134
aVBut then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me,
p135
aVand it is able to achieve the action that I want.
p136
aa(lp137
VThe next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought,
p138
aVand it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."
p139
aVI had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair,
p140
aVand I saw it explode up and out.
p141
aVAnd \u2014
p142
aVso the way I saw this in my mind at first,
p143
aVwas that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,
p144
aVand the pieces would move far out,
p145
aVand then they would begin to be pulled back
p146
aVwith a kind of a gravitational feel,
p147
aVto the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center.
p148
aVAnd they would coalesce for just a moment,
p149
aVso you could perceive that there was a chair there.
p150
aVFor me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment,
p151
aVand I wanted to express that.
p152
aVNow, the machine is \u2014 in this case, it's a real approximation of that,
p153
aVbecause obviously you can't move physical matter
p154
aVinfinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.
p155
aVThis whole thing is about four feet wide,
p156
aVand the chair itself is only about a few inches.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
VNow, this is a funny sort of conceptual thing,
p161
aVand yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' "10,000 Year Clock."
p162
aVSo, we have a motor here on the left,
p163
aVand it goes through a gear train.
p164
aVThere are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions,
p165
aVso that means that the final speed of that gear on the end
p166
aVis so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.
p167
aVSo I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VBecause it could run all the time.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, a completely different thought.
p176
aVI'm always imagining myself in different situations.
p177
aVI'm imagining myself as a machine.
p178
aVWhat would I love?
p179
aVI would love to be bathed in oil.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VSo, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
V(Applause)
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd it's really, just sort of \u2014
p190
aVfor me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd then, I got a call from a friend
p195
aVwho wanted to have a show of erotic art,
p196
aVand I didn't have any pieces.
p197
aVBut when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.
p198
aVSo, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.
p199
aVAnd this one I call "Machine with Grease."
p200
aVIt's just continually ejaculating, and it's \u2014
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter) \u2014
p203
aa(lp204
Vthis is a happy machine, I'll tell you.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VIt's definitely happy.
p209
aa(lp210
VFrom an engineering point of view,
p211
aVthis is just a little four-bar linkage.
p212
aVAnd then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found.
p213
aVAnd I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan,
p214
aVand how simply could I state something.
p215
aVAnd, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear
p216
aVbut also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant.
p217
aa(lp218
VFor me, the process is very important,
p219
aVbecause I'm inventing machines,
p220
aVbut I'm also inventing tools to make machines,
p221
aVand the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.
p222
aVSo this is a little wire-bending tool.
p223
aVAfter many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers,
p224
aVI made that tool, and then I made this other tool
p225
aVfor sort of centering gears very quickly \u2014
p226
aVsort of developing my own little world of technology.
p227
aVMy life completely changed when I found a spot welder.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd that was that tool.
p232
aVIt completely changed what I could do.
p233
aVNow here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering.
p234
aVThis is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school.
p235
aVI just like, throw it in.
p236
aVI mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in.
p237
aVSo, that's a finished gear.
p238
aa(lp239
VWhen I moved to Boston,
p240
aVI joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show
p245
aVpieces of sculpture on the street,
p246
aVand there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.
p247
aVIt would be \u2014 whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VSo I made \u2014 this is my first racing sculpture,
p252
aVand I thought, "Oh, I'm going to make a cart,
p253
aVand I'm going to have it \u2014
p254
aVI'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,'
p255
aVso as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me
p256
aVand it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' "
p257
aVSo, that's what it does.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VBut then in the end, what I decided
p262
aVwas every time you finish writing the word,
p263
aVI would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road.
p264
aVSo I would never win the race because I'm always stopping.
p265
aVBut I had a lot of fun.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
VNow, I only have two and a half minutes \u2014 I'm going to play this.
p270
aVThis is a piece that, for me, is in some ways
p271
aVthe most complete kind of piece.
p272
aVBecause when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar.
p273
aVAnd when I had this thought,
p274
aVI was imagining that I would make \u2014
p275
aVI would have a whole machine theater evening,
p276
aVwhere I would \u2014 you would have an audience,
p277
aVthe curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage.
p278
aVSo, I imagined a very simple gestural dance
p279
aVthat would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...
p280
aVWhen I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a point
p281
aVwhere I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple,
p282
aVbut also at the same time it's very ambiguous.
p283
aVAnd I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity
p284
aVwhich can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces
p287
aVstart off in my own mind, in my heart,
p288
aVand I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials,
p289
aVand it always feels really crude.
p290
aVIt's always a struggle,
p291
aVbut somehow I manage to sort of get this thought
p292
aVout into an object, and then it's there, OK.
p293
aVIt means nothing at all.
p294
aVThe object itself just means nothing.
p295
aVOnce it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind,
p296
aVthen there's a cycle that has been completed.
p297
aVAnd to me, that's the most important thing
p298
aVbecause, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love.
p299
aVAnd that means the complete cycle of coming from inside,
p300
aVout to the physical, to someone perceiving it.
p301
aVSo I'll just let this chair come down.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Applause)
p304
aa(lp305
VThank you.

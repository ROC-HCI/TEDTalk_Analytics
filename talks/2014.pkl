VEven nature's most disgusting creatures
p5
aVhave important secrets,
p6
aVbut who would want a swarm of cockroaches
p7
aVcoming towards them?
p8
aa(lp9
VYet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies
p10
aVrelates to robustness.
p11
aVRobust systems are stable in complex
p12
aVand new environments.
p13
aVRemarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize
p14
aVrunning over rough terrain.
p15
aVWhen we put a jet pack on them,
p16
aVor give them a perturbation like an earthquake,
p17
aVwe discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs
p18
aVallow them to self-stabilize
p19
aVwithout using any of their brainpower.
p20
aVThey can go over complex terrain like grass,
p21
aVno problem, and not get destabilized.
p22
aVWe discovered a new behavior where,
p23
aVbecause of their shape,
p24
aVthey actually roll automatically to their side
p25
aVto go through this artificial test bit of grass.
p26
aa(lp27
VRobust systems can perform multiple tasks
p28
aVwith the same structure.
p29
aVHere's a new behavior we've discovered.
p30
aVThe animals rapidly invert and disappear
p31
aVin less than 150 milliseconds \u2014 you never see them \u2014
p32
aVusing the same structures that they use to run, their legs.
p33
aVThey can run upside down
p34
aVvery rapidly on rods, branches and wires,
p35
aVand if you perturb one of those branches,
p36
aVthey can do this.
p37
aVThey can perform gymnastic maneuvers
p38
aVlike no robot we have yet.
p39
aVAnd they have nearly unlimited
p40
aVmaneuverability with that same structure
p41
aVand unprecedented access to a variety
p42
aVof different areas.
p43
aVThey have wings for flying when they get warm,
p44
aVbut they use those same wings to flip over
p45
aVif they get destabilized.
p46
aVVery effective.
p47
aa(lp48
VRobust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe.
p49
aVThis is the foot of a cockroach.
p50
aVIt has spines, gluey pads and claws,
p51
aVbut if you take off those feet,
p52
aVthey can still go over rough terrain,
p53
aVlike the bottom video that you see,
p54
aVwithout hardly slowing down. Extraordinary.
p55
aVThey can run up mesh without their feet.
p56
aVHere's an animal using a normal, alternating tripod:
p57
aVthree legs, three legs, three legs,
p58
aVbut in nature, the insects often have lost their legs.
p59
aVHere's one moving with two middle legs gone.
p60
aVIt can even lose three legs, in a tripod,
p61
aVand adopt a new gait, a hopping gait.
p62
aVAnd I point out that all of these videos
p63
aVare slowed down 20 times,
p64
aVso they're actually really fast, when you see this.
p65
aa(lp66
VRobust systems are also damage resistant.
p67
aVHere's an animal climbing up a wall.
p68
aVIt looks like a rapid, smooth, vertical climb,
p69
aVbut when you slow it down,
p70
aVyou see something very different.
p71
aVHere's what they do.
p72
aVThey intentionally have a head-on collision with the wall
p73
aVso they don't slow down and can transition up it
p74
aVin 75 milliseconds.
p75
aVAnd they can do this in part because they have
p76
aVextraordinary exoskeletons.
p77
aVAnd they're really just made up of compliant joints
p78
aVthat are tubes and plates
p79
aVconnected to one another.
p80
aVHere's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach.
p81
aVYou see these plates, and you see the compliant membrane.
p82
aa(lp83
VMy engineering colleague at Berkeley
p84
aVdesigned with his students
p85
aVa novel manufacturing technique
p86
aVwhere you essentially origami the exoskeleton,
p87
aVyou laser cut it, laminate it,
p88
aVand you fold it up into a robot.
p89
aVAnd you can do that now in less than 15 minutes.
p90
aVThese robots, called DASH,
p91
aVfor Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod,
p92
aVare highly compliant robots,
p93
aVand they're remarkably robust as a result
p94
aVof these features.
p95
aVThey're certainly incredibly damage resistant.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVThey even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches.
p98
aVSo they can use their smart, compliant body
p99
aVto transition up a wall
p100
aVin a very simple way.
p101
aVThey even have some of the beginnings
p102
aVof the rapid inversion behavior
p103
aVwhere they disappear.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow we want to know why they can go anywhere.
p106
aVWe discovered that they can go through
p107
aVthree-millimeter gaps,
p108
aVthe height of two pennies, two stacked pennies,
p109
aVand when they do this,
p110
aVthey can actually run through those confined spaces
p111
aVat high speeds,
p112
aValthough you never see it.
p113
aVTo understand it better,
p114
aVwe did a CT scan of the exoskeleton
p115
aVand showed that they can compress their body
p116
aVby over 40 percent.
p117
aVWe put them in a materials testing machine
p118
aVto look at the stress strain analysis
p119
aVand showed that they can withstand forces
p120
aV800 times their body weight,
p121
aVand after this they can fly and run
p122
aVabsolutely normally.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo you never know where
p125
aVcuriosity-based research will lead,
p126
aVand someday you may want a swarm
p127
aVof cockroach-inspired robots
p128
aVto come at you.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VThank you.

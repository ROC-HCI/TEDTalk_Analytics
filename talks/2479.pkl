VI have spent the past 38 years trying to be invisible.
p5
aVI'm a copy editor.
p6
aVI work at The New Yorker,
p7
aVand copyediting for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop
p8
aVfor a Major League Baseball team:
p9
aVevery little movement gets picked over by the critics \u2014
p10
aVGod forbid you should commit an error.
p11
aa(lp12
VJust to clarify: copy editors don't choose what goes into the magazine.
p13
aVWe work at the level of the sentence,
p14
aVmaybe the paragraph,
p15
aVthe words, the punctuation.
p16
aVOur business is in the details.
p17
aVWe put the diaeresis, the double dot, over the "i" in "naïve."
p18
aVWe impose house style.
p19
aVEvery publication has a house style.
p20
aVThe New Yorker's is particularly distinctive.
p21
aVWe sometimes get teased for our style.
p22
aVImagine \u2014 we still spell "teen-ager" with a hyphen,
p23
aVas if that word had just been coined.
p24
aVBut you see that hyphen in "teen-age"
p25
aVand that diaeresis over "coöperate,"
p26
aVand you know you're reading The New Yorker.
p27
aa(lp28
VCopyediting at The New Yorker is a mechanical process.
p29
aVThere is a related role called query proofreading,
p30
aVor page-OK'ing.
p31
aVWhereas copyediting is mechanical,
p32
aVquery proofreading is interpretive.
p33
aVWe make suggestions to the author through the editor
p34
aVto improve the emphasis of a sentence
p35
aVor point out unintentional repetitions
p36
aVand supply compelling alternatives.
p37
aVOur purpose is to make the author look good.
p38
aa(lp39
VNote that we give our proofs not directly to the author,
p40
aVbut to the editor.
p41
aVThis often creates a good cop/bad cop dynamic
p42
aVin which the copy editor \u2014 I'll use that as an umbrella term \u2014
p43
aVis invariably the bad cop.
p44
aVIf we do our job well, we're invisible,
p45
aVbut as soon as we make a mistake,
p46
aVwe copy editors become glaringly visible.
p47
aVHere is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door.
p48
aa(lp49
V[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin, the pre-Trump embodiment
p50
aVof populist no-nothingism in the Republican Party,
p51
aVendorsed Trump.]
p52
aa(lp53
V"Where were The New Yorker's fabled copy editors?" a reader wrote.
p54
aV"Didn't the writer mean 'know-nothingism'?"
p55
aa(lp56
VOuch.
p57
aVThere's no excuse for this mistake.
p58
aVBut I like it: "no-nothingism."
p59
aVIt might be American vernacular for "nihilism."
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VHere, another reader quotes a passage from the magazine:
p64
aa(lp65
V[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained her authoritative bearing;
p66
aVonly her unsteady gait belied her age.]
p67
aa(lp68
VHe added:
p69
aV"Surely, someone at The New Yorker knows the meaning of 'belied,'
p70
aVand that it is the opposite of how it is used in this sentence.
p71
aVCome on! Get it together."
p72
aa(lp73
VBelie: to give a false impression.
p74
aVIt should have been "betrayed."
p75
aa(lp76
VE.B. White once wrote of commas in The New Yorker:
p77
aV"They fall with the precision of knives outlining a body."
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd it's true \u2014 we get a lot of complaints about commas.
p82
aV"Are there really two commas in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?"
p83
aVThere may not be on the sign, but yes, that is New Yorker style for "Jr."
p84
aVOne wag wrote:
p85
aa(lp86
V["Please, could you expel, or, at least, restrain,
p87
aVthe comma-maniac, on your editorial staff?"]
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VAh, well.
p92
aVIn this case, those commas are well-placed,
p93
aVexcept that there should not be one
p94
aVbetween "maniac" and "on."
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VAlso, if we must have commas around "at least,"
p99
aVwe might change it up by using dashes around that phrase:
p100
aV"... \u2014 or, at least, restrain \u2014"
p101
aVPerfect.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Applause)
p104
aa(lp105
VThen there's this:
p106
aV"Love you, love your magazine,
p107
aVbut can you please stop writing massive numbers as text?"
p108
aa(lp109
V[two and a half million ...]
p110
aa(lp111
VNo.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VOne last cri de coeur from a spelling stickler:
p116
aa(lp117
V["Those long stringy things are vocal cords, not chords."]
p118
aa(lp119
VThe outraged reader added,
p120
aV"I'm sure I'm not the first to write
p121
aVregarding this egregious proofreading error,
p122
aVbut I'm equally sure I won't be the last.
p123
aVFie!"
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VI used to like getting mail.
p128
aa(lp129
VThere is a pact between writers and editors.
p130
aVThe editor never sells out the writer,
p131
aVnever goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut
p132
aVor stories that went on too long.
p133
aVA great editor saves a writer from her excesses.
p134
aVCopy editors, too, have a code;
p135
aVwe don't advertise our oversights.
p136
aVI feel disloyal divulging them here,
p137
aVso let's have look at what we do right.
p138
aa(lp139
VSomehow, I've gotten a reputation for sternness.
p140
aVBut I work with writers who know how to have their way with me.
p141
aVI've known Ian Frazier, or "Sandy," since the early 80s.
p142
aVAnd he's one of my favorites,
p143
aVeven though he sometimes writes a sentence
p144
aVthat gives a copy editor pause.
p145
aVHere is one from a story about Staten Island
p146
aVafter Hurricane Sandy:
p147
aa(lp148
V[A dock that had been broken in the middle and lost its other half
p149
aVsloped down toward the water,
p150
aVits support pipes and wires leaning forward
p151
aVlike when you open a box of linguine and it slides out.]
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VThis would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore.
p156
aVBut what could I do?
p157
aVTechnically, the "like" should be an "as,"
p158
aVbut it sounds ridiculous,
p159
aVas if the author were about to embark on an extended Homeric simile \u2014
p160
aV"as when you open a box of linguine."
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VI decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on Sandy
p165
aVand let the sentence stand.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VGenerally, if I think something is wrong,
p170
aVI query it three times.
p171
aVI told Sandy that not long ago in a moment of indiscretion and he said,
p172
aa(lp173
V"Only three?"
p174
aa(lp175
VSo, he has learned to hold out.
p176
aa(lp177
VRecently, he wrote a story for "Talk of the Town,"
p178
aVthat's the section at the front of the magazine
p179
aVwith short pieces on subjects ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit
p180
aVat the Metropolitan Museum
p181
aVto the introduction of doggie bags in France.
p182
aVSandy's story was about the return to the Bronx
p183
aVof Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
p184
aVThere were three things in it that I had to challenge.
p185
aa(lp186
VFirst, a grammar query.
p187
aVThe justice was wearing black and Sandy wrote,
p188
aa(lp189
V[Her face and hands stood out like in an old, mostly dark painting.]
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, unlike with the hurricane,
p192
aVwith this "like," the author didn't have the excuse
p193
aVof describing hurricane damage.
p194
aV"Like" in this sense is a preposition, and a preposition takes an object,
p195
aVwhich is a noun.
p196
aVThis "like" had to be an "as."
p197
aV"As in an old, mostly dark painting."
p198
aa(lp199
VSecond, a spelling issue.
p200
aVThe author was quoting someone who was assisting the justice:
p201
aa(lp202
V["It will be just a minute.
p203
aVWe are getting the justice mic'ed,"]
p204
aa(lp205
VMic'ed?
p206
aVThe music industry spells it "mic"
p207
aVbecause that's how it's spelled on the equipment.
p208
aVI'd never seen it used as a verb with this spelling,
p209
aVand I was distraught to think that "mic'ed"
p210
aVwould get into the magazine on my watch.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VNew Yorker style for "microphone" in its abbreviated form is "mike."
p215
aa(lp216
VFinally, there was a sticky grammar and usage issue
p217
aVin which the pronoun has to have the same grammatical number
p218
aVas its antecedent.
p219
aa(lp220
V[everyone in the vicinity held their breath]
p221
aa(lp222
V"Their" is plural and "everyone," its antecedent, is singular.
p223
aVYou would never say, "Everyone were there."
p224
aVEveryone was there. Everyone is here.
p225
aVBut people say things like, "Everyone held their breath" all the time.
p226
aVTo give it legitimacy,
p227
aVcopy editors call it "the singular 'their,'"
p228
aVas if calling it singular makes it no longer plural.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VIt is my job when I see it in print to do my best to eliminate it.
p233
aVI couldn't make it, "Everyone held her breath,"
p234
aVor "Everyone held his breath,"
p235
aVor "Everyone held his or her breath."
p236
aVWhatever I suggested had to blend in.
p237
aVI asked, through the editor,
p238
aVif the author would consider changing it
p239
aVto "All in the vicinity held their breath,"
p240
aVbecause "all" is plural.
p241
aVNope.
p242
aa(lp243
VI tried again: "All those present held their breath?"
p244
aVI thought this sounded vaguely judicial.
p245
aVBut the editor pointed out
p246
aVthat we could not have "present" and "presence"
p247
aVin the same sentence.
p248
aVWhen the final proof came back,
p249
aVthe author had accepted "as" for "like,"
p250
aVand "miked" for "mic'ed."
p251
aVBut on "Everyone held their breath," he stood his ground.
p252
aVTwo out of three isn't bad.
p253
aa(lp254
VIn the same issue,
p255
aVin that piece on doggie bags in France,
p256
aVthere was the gratuitous use of the f-word by a Frenchman.
p257
aVI wonder, when the mail comes in,
p258
aVwhich will have offended the readers more.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VThank you.

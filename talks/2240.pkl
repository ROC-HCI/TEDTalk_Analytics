VGrowing up, I didn't always understand
p5
aVwhy my parents made me follow the rules that they did.
p6
aVLike, why did I really  have to mow the lawn?
p7
aVWhy was homework really that important?
p8
aVWhy couldn't I put jelly beans  in my oatmeal?
p9
aa(lp10
VMy childhood was abound with questions like this.
p11
aVNormal things about being a kid and realizing that sometimes,
p12
aVit was best to listen to my parents even when I didn't exactly understand why.
p13
aVAnd it's not that they didn't want me to think critically.
p14
aVTheir parenting always sought  to reconcile the tension
p15
aVbetween having my siblings and I understand the realities of the world,
p16
aVwhile ensuring that we never accepted the status quo as inevitable.
p17
aa(lp18
VI came to realize that this, in and of itself,
p19
aVwas a very purposeful form of education.
p20
aVOne of my favorite educators, Brazilian author and scholar Paulo Freire,
p21
aVspeaks quite explicitly about the need for education
p22
aVto be used as a tool for critical  awakening and shared humanity.
p23
aVIn his most famous book, "Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"
p24
aVhe states, "No one can be  authentically human
p25
aVwhile he prevents others from being so."
p26
aa(lp27
VI've been thinking a lot about this  lately, this idea of humanity,
p28
aVand specifically, who in this world is afforded the privilege
p29
aVof being perceived as fully human.
p30
aVOver the course of  the past several months,
p31
aVthe world has watched as unarmed black men, and women,
p32
aVhave had their lives taken at the hands of police and vigilante.
p33
aVThese events and all that  has transpired after them
p34
aVhave brought me back to my own childhood
p35
aVand the decisions that my parents made about raising a black boy in America
p36
aVthat growing up, I didn't always understand in the way that I do now.
p37
aa(lp38
VI think of how hard it must have been, how profoundly unfair it must have felt
p39
aVfor them to feel like they had  to strip away parts of my childhood
p40
aVjust so that I could come home at night.
p41
aa(lp42
VFor example, I think of how one night,
p43
aVwhen I was around 12 years old, on an overnight field trip to another city,
p44
aVmy friends and I bought Super Soakers
p45
aVand turned the hotel parking lot into our own water-filled battle zone.
p46
aVWe hid behind cars,
p47
aVrunning through the darkness that lay between the streetlights,
p48
aVboundless laughter ubiquitous  across the pavement.
p49
aVBut within 10 minutes,
p50
aVmy father came outside,  grabbed me by my forearm
p51
aVand led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip.
p52
aVBefore I could say anything,
p53
aVtell him how foolish he had  made me look in front of my friends,
p54
aVhe derided me for being so naive.
p55
aVLooked me in the eye,  fear consuming his face,
p56
aVand said, "Son, I'm sorry,
p57
aVbut you can't act the same  as your white friends.
p58
aVYou can't pretend to shoot guns.
p59
aVYou can't run around in the dark.
p60
aVYou can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth."
p61
aa(lp62
VI know now how scared he must have been,
p63
aVhow easily I could have fallen into the empty of the night,
p64
aVthat some man would mistake this water
p65
aVfor a good reason to wash all of this away.
p66
aa(lp67
VThese are the sorts of messages I've been inundated with my entire life:
p68
aVAlways keep your hands where they  can see them, don't move too quickly,
p69
aVtake off your hood when the sun goes down.
p70
aVMy parents raised me and my siblings in an armor of advice,
p71
aVan ocean of alarm bells so someone wouldn't steal the breath from our lungs,
p72
aVso that they wouldn't make a memory of this skin.
p73
aVSo that we could be kids,  not casket or concrete.
p74
aVAnd it's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else
p75
aVit's simply because they wanted  to keep us alive.
p76
aa(lp77
VAll of my black friends were raised with the same message,
p78
aVthe talk, given to us  when we became old enough
p79
aVto be mistaken for a nail ready to be hammered to the ground,
p80
aVwhen people made our melanin synonymous with something to be feared.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut what does it do to a child
p83
aVto grow up knowing that you cannot simply be a child?
p84
aVThat the whims of adolescence are too dangerous for your breath,
p85
aVthat you cannot simply be curious,
p86
aVthat you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake,
p87
aVthat someone's implicit bias
p88
aVmight be the reason you don't wake up in the morning.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut this cannot be what defines us.
p91
aVBecause we have parents who raised us to understand
p92
aVthat our bodies weren't meant for the backside of a bullet,
p93
aVbut for flying kites and jumping rope, and laughing until our stomachs burst.
p94
aVWe had teachers who taught us  how to raise our hands in class,
p95
aVand not just to signal surrender,
p96
aVand that the only thing we should give up
p97
aVis the idea that we  aren't worthy of this world.
p98
aVSo when we say that black lives matter, it's not because others don't,
p99
aVit's simply because we must affirm that we are worthy of existing without fear,
p100
aVwhen so many things tell us we are not.
p101
aVI want to live in a world where my son
p102
aVwill not be presumed guilty the moment he is born,
p103
aVwhere a toy in his hand isn't mistaken for anything other than a toy.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd I refuse to accept that we can't build this world into something new,
p106
aVsome place where a child's name
p107
aVdoesn't have to be written  on a t-shirt, or a tombstone,
p108
aVwhere the value of someone's life
p109
aVisn't determined by anything other  than the fact that they had lungs,
p110
aVa place where every single  one of us can breathe.
p111
aa(lp112
VThank you.

p5
aVI want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.
p6
aVI'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument
p7
aVthat's going to tell you a little bit
p8
aVabout how we open user-generated content up for business.
p9
aVSo, here's the first story.
p10
aa(lp11
V1906. This man, John Philip Sousa, traveled to this place,
p12
aVthe United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,
p13
aVwhat he called the, quote, "talking machines."
p14
aVSousa was not a fan of the talking machines.
p15
aVThis is what he had to say.
p16
aV"These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development
p17
aVof music in this country.
p18
aVWhen I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings,
p19
aVyou would find young people together
p20
aVsinging the songs of the day, or the old songs.
p21
aVToday, you hear these infernal machines going night and day.
p22
aVWe will not have a vocal chord left," Sousa said.
p23
aV"The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution
p24
aVas was the tail of man when he came from the ape."
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, this is the picture I want you to focus on.
p27
aVThis is a picture of culture.
p28
aVWe could describe it using modern computer terminology
p29
aVas a kind of read-write culture.
p30
aVIt's a culture where people participate in the creation
p31
aVand the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.
p32
aVSousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity
p33
aVbecause of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.
p34
aVAnd in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture,
p35
aVwhat we could call read-only culture.
p36
aVCulture where creativity was consumed
p37
aVbut the consumer is not a creator.
p38
aVA culture which is top-down, owned,
p39
aVwhere the vocal chords of the millions have been lost.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, as you look back at the twentieth century,
p42
aVat least in what we think of as the, quote, "developed world" \u2014
p43
aVhard not to conclude that Sousa was right.
p44
aVNever before in the history of human culture
p45
aVhad it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.
p46
aVNever before has creativity of the millions
p47
aVbeen as effectively displaced,
p48
aVand displaced because of these, quote, "infernal machines."
p49
aVThe twentieth century was that century
p50
aVwhere, at least for those places we know the best,
p51
aVculture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, second. Land is a kind of property \u2014
p54
aVit is property. It's protected by law.
p55
aVAs Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trespass law,
p56
aVfor most of the history of trespass law,
p57
aVby presuming it protects the land all the way down below
p58
aVand to an indefinite extent upward.
p59
aVNow, that was a pretty good system
p60
aVfor most of the history of the regulation of land,
p61
aVuntil this technology came along, and people began to wonder,
p62
aVwere these instruments trespassers
p63
aVas they flew over land without clearing the rights
p64
aVof the farms below as they traveled across the country?
p65
aVWell, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question.
p66
aa(lp67
VTwo farmers, Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby, who raised chickens,
p68
aVhad a significant complaint because of these technologies.
p69
aVThe complaint was that their
p70
aVchickens followed the pattern of the airplanes
p71
aVand flew themselves into the walls of the barn
p72
aVwhen the airplanes flew over the land.
p73
aVAnd so they appealed to Lord Blackstone
p74
aVto say these airplanes were trespassing.
p75
aVSince time immemorial, the law had said,
p76
aVyou can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner,
p77
aVso this flight must stop.
p78
aVWell, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years tradition
p79
aVand said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas,
p80
aVthat the Causbys must lose.
p81
aVThe Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land
p82
aVall the way to the sky has no place in the modern world,
p83
aVotherwise every transcontinental flight would
p84
aVsubject the operator to countless trespass suits.
p85
aVCommon sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense \u2014
p86
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p87
aVRevolts at the idea. Common sense.
p88
aa(lp89
VFinally. Before the Internet, the last great terror
p90
aVto rain down on the content industry
p91
aVwas a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting:
p92
aVa new way to spread content,
p93
aVand therefore a new battle over the control
p94
aVof the businesses that would spread content.
p95
aVNow, at that time, the entity,
p96
aVthe legal cartel, that controlled the performance rights
p97
aVfor most of the music that would be broadcast
p98
aVusing these technologies was ASCAP.
p99
aVThey had an exclusive license on the most popular content,
p100
aVand they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate
p101
aVto the broadcasters who really was in charge.
p102
aVSo, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,
p103
aVuntil the broadcasters finally got together
p104
aVand said, okay, enough of this.
p105
aVAnd in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started something
p106
aVcalled Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.
p107
aVAnd BMI was much more democratic in the art
p108
aVthat it would include within its repertoire,
p109
aVincluding African American music for the first time in the repertoire.
p110
aVBut most important was that BMI took public domain works
p111
aVand made arrangements of them, which they gave away for free
p112
aVto their subscribers. So that in 1940,
p113
aVwhen ASCAP threatened to double their rates,
p114
aVthe majority of broadcasters switched to BMI.
p115
aVNow, ASCAP said they didn't care.
p116
aVThe people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music
p117
aVwas no longer available, because they had shifted
p118
aVto the second best public domain provided by BMI.
p119
aVWell, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.
p120
aVAnd the important point to recognize
p121
aVis that even though these broadcasters
p122
aVwere broadcasting something you would call second best,
p123
aVthat competition was enough to break, at that time,
p124
aVthis legal cartel over access to music.
p125
aa(lp126
VOkay. Three stories. Here's the argument.
p127
aVIn my view, the most significant thing to recognize
p128
aVabout what this Internet is doing
p129
aVis its opportunity to revive the read-write culture
p130
aVthat Sousa romanticized.
p131
aVDigital technology is the opportunity
p132
aVfor the revival of these vocal chords
p133
aVthat he spoke so passionately to Congress about.
p134
aVUser-generated content, spreading in businesses
p135
aVin extraordinarily valuable ways like these,
p136
aVcelebrating amateur culture.
p137
aVBy which I don't mean amateurish culture,
p138
aVI mean culture where people produce
p139
aVfor the love of what they're doing and not for the money.
p140
aVI mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time.
p141
aVFor when you think of what Sousa romanticized
p142
aVin the young people together, singing the songs of the day,
p143
aVof the old songs, you should recognize
p144
aVwhat your kids are doing right now.
p145
aVTaking the songs of the day and the old songs
p146
aVand remixing them to make them something different.
p147
aVIt's how they understand access to this culture.
p148
aVSo, let's have some very few examples
p149
aVto get a sense of what I'm talking about here.
p150
aa(lp151
VHere's something called Anime Music Video, first example,
p152
aVtaking anime captured from television
p153
aVre-edited to music tracks.
p154
aV(Music)
p155
aVThis one you should be \u2014 confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry.
p156
aV(Music)
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aVAnd this is the best.
p159
aV(Music)
p160
aVMy love ...
p161
aVThere's only you in my life ...
p162
aVThe only thing that's bright ...
p163
aVMy first love ...
p164
aVYou're every breath that I take ...
p165
aVYou're every step I make ...
p166
aVAnd I ....
p167
aVI want to share all my love with you ...
p168
aVNo one else will do ...
p169
aVAnd your eyes ...
p170
aVThey tell me how much you care ...
p171
aV(Music)
p172
aVSo, this is remix, right?
p173
aV(Applause)
p174
aVAnd it's important to emphasize that what this is not
p175
aVis not what we call, quote, "piracy."
p176
aVI'm not talking about nor justifying
p177
aVpeople taking other people's content in wholesale
p178
aVand distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner.
p179
aVI'm talking about people taking and recreating
p180
aVusing other people's content, using digital technologies
p181
aVto say things differently.
p182
aVNow, the importance of this
p183
aVis not the technique that you've seen here.
p184
aVBecause, of course, every technique that you've seen here
p185
aVis something that television and film producers
p186
aVhave been able to do for the last 50 years.
p187
aVThe importance is that that technique has been democratized.
p188
aVIt is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computer
p189
aVwho can take sounds and images from the culture around us
p190
aVand use it to say things differently.
p191
aVThese tools of creativity have become tools of speech.
p192
aVIt is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak.
p193
aVIt is how our kids think. It is what your kids are
p194
aVas they increasingly understand digital technologies
p195
aVand their relationship to themselves.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies,
p198
aVthe law has not greeted this Sousa revival
p199
aVwith very much common sense.
p200
aVInstead, the architecture of copyright law
p201
aVand the architecture of digital technologies,
p202
aVas they interact, have produced the presumption
p203
aVthat these activities are illegal.
p204
aVBecause if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies,
p205
aVthen in the digital world the one fact we can't escape
p206
aVis that every single use of culture produces a copy.
p207
aVEvery single use therefore requires permission;
p208
aVwithout permission, you are a trespasser.
p209
aVYou're a trespasser with about as much sense
p210
aVas these people were trespassers.
p211
aVCommon sense here, though, has not yet revolted
p212
aVin response to this response that the law has offered
p213
aVto these forms of creativity.
p214
aVInstead, what we've seen
p215
aVis something much worse than a revolt.
p216
aVThere's a growing extremism that comes from both sides
p217
aVin this debate, in response to this conflict
p218
aVbetween the law and the use of these technologies.
p219
aa(lp220
VOne side builds new technologies, such as one recently announced
p221
aVthat will enable them
p222
aVto automatically take down from sites like YouTube
p223
aVany content that has any copyrighted content in it,
p224
aVwhether or not there's a judgment of fair use
p225
aVthat might be applied to the use of that content.
p226
aVAnd on the other side, among our kids,
p227
aVthere's a growing copyright abolitionism,
p228
aVa generation that rejects the very notion
p229
aVof what copyright is supposed to do, rejects copyright
p230
aVand believes that the law is nothing more than an ass
p231
aVto be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible.
p232
aVThe extremism on one side begets extremism on the other,
p233
aVa fact we should have learned many, many times over,
p234
aVand both extremes in this debate are just wrong.
p235
aVNow, the balance that I try to fight for,
p236
aVI, as any good liberal, try to fight for first
p237
aVby looking to the government. Total mistake, right?
p238
aV(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VLooked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them
p241
aVto do something to make the system make more sense.
p242
aVIt failed partly because the courts are too passive,
p243
aVpartly because the legislatures are corrupted,
p244
aVby which I don't mean that there's bribery
p245
aVoperating to stop real change,
p246
aVbut more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions
p247
aVmeans that policymakers here will not understand this
p248
aVuntil it's too late to fix it.
p249
aVSo, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution.
p250
aVAnd the solution here, in my view, is a private solution,
p251
aVa solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again,
p252
aVand to realize the economic potential of that,
p253
aVand that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.
p254
aVBecause, as BMI demonstrated, competition here
p255
aVcan achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.
p256
aVWe don't have a public domain to draw upon now,
p257
aVso instead what we need is two types of changes.
p258
aa(lp259
VFirst, that artists and creators embrace the idea,
p260
aVchoose that their work be made available more freely.
p261
aVSo, for example, they can say their work is available freely
p262
aVfor non-commercial, this amateur-type of use,
p263
aVbut not freely for any commercial use.
p264
aVAnd second, we need the businesses
p265
aVthat are building out this read-write culture
p266
aVto embrace this opportunity expressly, to enable it,
p267
aVso that this ecology of free content, or freer content,
p268
aVcan grow on a neutral platform
p269
aVwhere they both exist simultaneously,
p270
aVso that more-free can compete with less-free,
p271
aVand the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition
p272
aVcan teach one the lessons of the other.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow, I would talk about one particular such plan
p275
aVthat I know something about,
p276
aVbut I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling,
p277
aVso I'm not going to talk about this at all.
p278
aVI'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us.
p279
aVThat artist choice is the key for new technology
p280
aVhaving an opportunity to be open for business,
p281
aVand we need to build artist choice here
p282
aVif these new technologies are to have that opportunity.
p283
aVBut let me end with something I think much more important \u2014
p284
aVmuch more important than business.
p285
aVIt's the point about how this connects to our kids.
p286
aVWe have to recognize they're different from us. This is us, right?
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVWe made mixed tapes; they remix music.
p289
aVWe watched TV; they make TV.
p290
aa(lp291
VIt is technology that has made them different,
p292
aVand as we see what this technology can do,
p293
aVwe need to recognize you can't kill
p294
aVthe instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it.
p295
aVWe can't stop our kids from using it.
p296
aVWe can only drive it underground.
p297
aVWe can't make our kids passive again.
p298
aVWe can only make them, quote, "pirates." And is that good?
p299
aVWe live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions,
p300
aVwhere in many areas of our life,
p301
aVwe live life constantly against the law.
p302
aVOrdinary people live life against the law,
p303
aVand that's what I \u2014 we are doing to our kids.
p304
aVThey live life knowing they live it against the law.
p305
aVThat realization is extraordinarily corrosive,
p306
aVextraordinarily corrupting.
p307
aVAnd in a democracy, we ought to be able to do better.
p308
aVDo better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.
p309
aVThank you very much.

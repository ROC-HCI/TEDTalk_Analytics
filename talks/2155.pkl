VIt used to be that if you wanted to get a computer to do something new,
p5
aVyou would have to program it.
p6
aVNow, programming, for those of you here that haven't done it yourself,
p7
aVrequires laying out in excruciating detail
p8
aVevery single step that you want the computer to do
p9
aVin order to achieve your goal.
p10
aVNow, if you want to do something that you don't know how to do yourself,
p11
aVthen this is going to be a great challenge.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo this was the challenge faced by this man, Arthur Samuel.
p14
aVIn 1956, he wanted to get this computer
p15
aVto be able to beat him at checkers.
p16
aVHow can you write a program,
p17
aVlay out in excruciating detail, how to be better than you at checkers?
p18
aVSo he came up with an idea:
p19
aVhe had the computer play against itself thousands of times
p20
aVand learn how to play checkers.
p21
aVAnd indeed it worked, and in fact, by 1962,
p22
aVthis computer had beaten the Connecticut state champion.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning,
p25
aVand I have a great debt to him,
p26
aVbecause I am a machine learning practitioner.
p27
aVI was the president of Kaggle,
p28
aVa community of over 200,000 machine learning practictioners.
p29
aVKaggle puts up competitions
p30
aVto try and get them to solve previously unsolved problems,
p31
aVand it's been successful  hundreds of times.
p32
aVSo from this vantage point, I was able to find out
p33
aVa lot about what machine learning can do in the past, can do today,
p34
aVand what it could do in the future.
p35
aVPerhaps the first big success of  machine learning commercially was Google.
p36
aVGoogle showed that it is possible to find information
p37
aVby using a computer algorithm,
p38
aVand this algorithm is based on machine learning.
p39
aVSince that time, there have been many commercial successes of machine learning.
p40
aVCompanies like Amazon and Netflix
p41
aVuse machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy,
p42
aVmovies that you might like to watch.
p43
aVSometimes, it's almost creepy.
p44
aVCompanies like LinkedIn and Facebook
p45
aVsometimes will tell you about who your friends might be
p46
aVand you have no idea how it did it,
p47
aVand this is because it's using the power of machine learning.
p48
aVThese are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data
p49
aVrather than being programmed by hand.
p50
aa(lp51
VThis is also how IBM was successful
p52
aVin getting Watson to beat the two world champions at "Jeopardy,"
p53
aVanswering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one.
p54
aV["The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missing from this city's national museum in 2003  (along with a lot of other stuff)"]
p55
aVThis is also why we are now able to see the first self-driving cars.
p56
aVIf you want to be able to tell the difference between, say,
p57
aVa tree and a pedestrian, well, that's pretty important.
p58
aVWe don't know how to write those programs by hand,
p59
aVbut with machine learning, this is now possible.
p60
aVAnd in fact, this car has driven  over a million miles
p61
aVwithout any accidents on regular roads.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo we now know that computers can learn,
p64
aVand computers can learn to do things
p65
aVthat we actually sometimes don't know how to do ourselves,
p66
aVor maybe can do them better than us.
p67
aVOne of the most amazing examples I've seen of machine learning
p68
aVhappened on a project that I ran at Kaggle
p69
aVwhere a team run by a guy called Geoffrey Hinton
p70
aVfrom the University of Toronto
p71
aVwon a competition for automatic drug discovery.
p72
aVNow, what was extraordinary here is not just that they beat
p73
aVall of the algorithms developed by Merck or the international academic community,
p74
aVbut nobody on the team had any background in chemistry or biology or life sciences,
p75
aVand they did it in two weeks.
p76
aVHow did they do this?
p77
aVThey used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning.
p78
aVSo important was this that in fact the success was covered
p79
aVin The New York Times in a front page article a few weeks later.
p80
aVThis is Geoffrey Hinton here on the left-hand side.
p81
aVDeep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works,
p82
aVand as a result it's an algorithm
p83
aVwhich has no theoretical limitations on what it can do.
p84
aVThe more data you give it and the more computation time you give it,
p85
aVthe better it gets.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe New York Times also showed in this article
p88
aVanother extraordinary result of deep learning
p89
aVwhich I'm going to show you now.
p90
aVIt shows that computers  can listen and understand.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Video) Richard Rashid: Now, the last step
p93
aVthat I want to be able to take in this process
p94
aVis to actually speak to you in Chinese.
p95
aVNow the key thing there is,
p96
aVwe've been able to take a large amount  of information from many Chinese speakers
p97
aVand produce a text-to-speech system
p98
aVthat takes Chinese text and converts it into Chinese language,
p99
aVand then we've taken an hour or so of my own voice
p100
aVand we've used that to modulate
p101
aVthe standard text-to-speech system so that it would sound like me.
p102
aVAgain, the result's not perfect.
p103
aVThere are in fact quite a few errors.
p104
aV(In Chinese)
p105
aV(Applause)
p106
aVThere's much work to be done in this area.
p107
aV(In Chinese)
p108
aV(Applause)
p109
aa(lp110
VJeremy Howard: Well, that was at a machine learning conference in China.
p111
aVIt's not often, actually, at academic conferences
p112
aVthat you do hear spontaneous applause,
p113
aValthough of course sometimes at TEDx conferences, feel free.
p114
aVEverything you saw there was happening with deep learning.
p115
aV(Applause) Thank you.
p116
aVThe transcription in English was deep learning.
p117
aVThe translation to Chinese and the text in the top right, deep learning,
p118
aVand the construction of the voice was deep learning as well.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo deep learning is this extraordinary thing.
p121
aVIt's a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything,
p122
aVand I discovered that a year earlier, it had also learned to see.
p123
aVIn this obscure competition from Germany
p124
aVcalled the German Traffic Sign  Recognition Benchmark,
p125
aVdeep learning had learned to recognize traffic signs like this one.
p126
aVNot only could it recognize the traffic signs
p127
aVbetter than any other algorithm,
p128
aVthe leaderboard actually showed it was better than people,
p129
aVabout twice as good as people.
p130
aVSo by 2011, we had the first example
p131
aVof computers that can see better than people.
p132
aVSince that time, a lot has happened.
p133
aVIn 2012, Google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm
p134
aVwatch YouTube videos
p135
aVand crunched the data on 16,000 computers for a month,
p136
aVand the computer independently learned about concepts such as people and cats
p137
aVjust by watching the videos.
p138
aVThis is much like the way that humans learn.
p139
aVHumans don't learn by being told what they see,
p140
aVbut by learning for themselves what these things are.
p141
aVAlso in 2012, Geoffrey Hinton, who we saw earlier,
p142
aVwon the very popular ImageNet competition,
p143
aVlooking to try to figure out  from one and a half million images
p144
aVwhat they're pictures of.
p145
aVAs of 2014, we're now down to a six percent error rate
p146
aVin image recognition.
p147
aVThis is better than people, again.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo machines really are doing an extraordinarily good job of this,
p150
aVand it is now being used in industry.
p151
aVFor example, Google announced last year
p152
aVthat they had mapped every single location in France in two hours,
p153
aVand the way they did it was that they fed street view images
p154
aVinto a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers.
p155
aVImagine how long it would have taken before:
p156
aVdozens of people, many years.
p157
aVThis is also happening in China.
p158
aVBaidu is kind of  the Chinese Google, I guess,
p159
aVand what you see here in the top left
p160
aVis an example of a picture that I uploaded to Baidu's deep learning system,
p161
aVand underneath you can see that the system has understood what that picture is
p162
aVand found similar images.
p163
aVThe similar images actually have similar backgrounds,
p164
aVsimilar directions of the faces,
p165
aVeven some with their tongue out.
p166
aVThis is not clearly looking at the text of a web page.
p167
aVAll I uploaded was an image.
p168
aVSo we now have computers which really understand what they see
p169
aVand can therefore search databases
p170
aVof hundreds of millions of images in real time.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo what does it mean now that computers can see?
p173
aVWell, it's not just  that computers can see.
p174
aVIn fact, deep learning has done more than that.
p175
aVComplex, nuanced sentences like this one
p176
aVare now understandable with deep learning algorithms.
p177
aVAs you can see here,
p178
aVthis Stanford-based system showing the red dot at the top
p179
aVhas figured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment.
p180
aVDeep learning now in fact is near human performance
p181
aVat understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things.
p182
aVAlso, deep learning has been used to read Chinese,
p183
aVagain at about native Chinese speaker level.
p184
aVThis algorithm developed out of Switzerland
p185
aVby people, none of whom speak or understand any Chinese.
p186
aVAs I say, using deep learning
p187
aVis about the best system in the world for this,
p188
aVeven compared to native human understanding.
p189
aa(lp190
VThis is a system that we put together at my company
p191
aVwhich shows putting all this stuff together.
p192
aVThese are pictures which have no text attached,
p193
aVand as I'm typing in here sentences,
p194
aVin real time it's understanding these pictures
p195
aVand figuring out what they're about
p196
aVand finding pictures that are similar to the text that I'm writing.
p197
aVSo you can see, it's actually understanding my sentences
p198
aVand actually understanding these pictures.
p199
aVI know that you've seen something like this on Google,
p200
aVwhere you can type in things and it will show you pictures,
p201
aVbut actually what it's doing is it's searching the webpage for the text.
p202
aVThis is very different from actually understanding the images.
p203
aVThis is something that computers have only been able to do
p204
aVfor the first time in the last few months.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo we can see now that computers can not only see but they can also read,
p207
aVand, of course, we've shown that they can understand what they hear.
p208
aVPerhaps not surprising now that I'm going to tell you they can write.
p209
aVHere is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday.
p210
aVAnd here is some text that an algorithm out of Stanford generated.
p211
aVEach of these sentences was generated
p212
aVby a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures.
p213
aVThis algorithm before has never seen a man in a black shirt playing a guitar.
p214
aVIt's seen a man before, it's seen black before,
p215
aVit's seen a guitar before,
p216
aVbut it has independently generated this novel description of this picture.
p217
aVWe're still not quite at human performance here, but we're close.
p218
aVIn tests, humans prefer the computer-generated caption
p219
aVone out of four times.
p220
aVNow this system is now only two weeks old,
p221
aVso probably within the next year,
p222
aVthe computer algorithm will be well past human performance
p223
aVat the rate things are going.
p224
aVSo computers can also write.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities.
p227
aVFor example, in medicine,
p228
aVa team in Boston announced that they had discovered
p229
aVdozens of new clinically relevant features
p230
aVof tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer.
p231
aVVery similarly, in Stanford,
p232
aVa group there announced that, looking at tissues under magnification,
p233
aVthey've developed  a machine learning-based system
p234
aVwhich in fact is better than human pathologists
p235
aVat predicting survival rates for cancer sufferers.
p236
aVIn both of these cases, not only were the predictions more accurate,
p237
aVbut they generated new insightful science.
p238
aVIn the radiology case,
p239
aVthey were new clinical indicators that humans can understand.
p240
aVIn this pathology case,
p241
aVthe computer system actually discovered that the cells around the cancer
p242
aVare as important as the cancer cells themselves
p243
aVin making a diagnosis.
p244
aVThis is the opposite of what pathologists had been taught for decades.
p245
aVIn each of those two cases, they were systems developed
p246
aVby a combination of medical experts and machine learning experts,
p247
aVbut as of last year, we're now beyond that too.
p248
aVThis is an example of identifying cancerous areas
p249
aVof human tissue under a microscope.
p250
aVThe system being shown here can identify those areas more accurately,
p251
aVor about as accurately, as human pathologists,
p252
aVbut was built entirely with deep learning using no medical expertise
p253
aVby people who have no background in the field.
p254
aVSimilarly, here, this neuron segmentation.
p255
aVWe can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can,
p256
aVbut this system was developed with deep learning
p257
aVusing people with no previous  background in medicine.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo myself, as somebody with no previous background in medicine,
p260
aVI seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company,
p261
aVwhich I did.
p262
aVI was kind of terrified of doing it,
p263
aVbut the theory seemed to suggest that it ought to be possible
p264
aVto do very useful medicine using just these data analytic techniques.
p265
aVAnd thankfully, the feedback has been fantastic,
p266
aVnot just from the media but from the medical community,
p267
aVwho have been very supportive.
p268
aVThe theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process
p269
aVand turn that into data analysis as much as possible,
p270
aVleaving doctors to do what they're best at.
p271
aVI want to give you an example.
p272
aVIt now takes us about 15 minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test
p273
aVand I'll show you that in real time now,
p274
aVbut I've compressed it down to  three minutes by cutting some pieces out.
p275
aVRather than showing you creating a medical diagnostic test,
p276
aVI'm going to show you  a diagnostic test of car images,
p277
aVbecause that's something we can all understand.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo here we're starting with  about 1.5 million car images,
p280
aVand I want to create something that can split them into the angle
p281
aVof the photo that's being taken.
p282
aVSo these images are entirely unlabeled, so I have to start from scratch.
p283
aVWith our deep learning algorithm,
p284
aVit can automatically identify areas of structure in these images.
p285
aVSo the nice thing is that the human and the computer can now work together.
p286
aVSo the human, as you can see here,
p287
aVis telling the computer about areas of interest
p288
aVwhich it wants the computer then to try and use to improve its algorithm.
p289
aVNow, these deep learning systems actually are in 16,000-dimensional space,
p290
aVso you can see here the computer rotating this through that space,
p291
aVtrying to find new areas of structure.
p292
aVAnd when it does so successfully,
p293
aVthe human who is driving it can then point out the areas that are interesting.
p294
aVSo here, the computer has successfully found areas,
p295
aVfor example, angles.
p296
aVSo as we go through this process,
p297
aVwe're gradually telling the computer more and more
p298
aVabout the kinds of structures we're looking for.
p299
aVYou can imagine in a diagnostic test
p300
aVthis would be a pathologist identifying areas of pathosis, for example,
p301
aVor a radiologist indicating potentially troublesome nodules.
p302
aVAnd sometimes it can be difficult for the algorithm.
p303
aVIn this case, it got kind of confused.
p304
aVThe fronts and the backs of the cars are all mixed up.
p305
aVSo here we have to be a bit more careful,
p306
aVmanually selecting these fronts as opposed to the backs,
p307
aVthen telling the computer that this is a type of group
p308
aVthat we're interested in.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo we do that for a while, we skip over a little bit,
p311
aVand then we train the machine learning algorithm
p312
aVbased on these couple of hundred things,
p313
aVand we hope that it's gotten a lot better.
p314
aVYou can see, it's now started to fade some of these pictures out,
p315
aVshowing us that it already is recognizing how to understand some of these itself.
p316
aVWe can then use this concept of similar images,
p317
aVand using similar images, you can now see,
p318
aVthe computer at this point is able to entirely find just the fronts of cars.
p319
aVSo at this point, the human can tell the computer,
p320
aVokay, yes, you've done a good job of that.
p321
aa(lp322
VSometimes, of course, even at this point
p323
aVit's still difficult to separate out groups.
p324
aVIn this case, even after we let the computer try to rotate this for a while,
p325
aVwe still find that the left sides and the right sides pictures
p326
aVare all mixed up together.
p327
aVSo we can again give the computer some hints,
p328
aVand we say, okay, try and find a projection that separates out
p329
aVthe left sides and the right sides as much as possible
p330
aVusing this deep learning algorithm.
p331
aVAnd giving it that hint \u2014 ah, okay, it's been successful.
p332
aVIt's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects
p333
aVthat's separated out these together.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo you get the idea here.
p336
aVThis is a case not where the human is being replaced by a computer,
p337
aVbut where they're working together.
p338
aVWhat we're doing here is we're replacing something that used to take a team
p339
aVof five or six people about seven years
p340
aVand replacing it with something that takes 15 minutes
p341
aVfor one person acting alone.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo this process takes about four or five iterations.
p344
aVYou can see we now have 62 percent
p345
aVof our 1.5 million images  classified correctly.
p346
aVAnd at this point, we can start to quite quickly
p347
aVgrab whole big sections,
p348
aVcheck through them to make sure that there's no mistakes.
p349
aVWhere there are mistakes, we can let the computer know about them.
p350
aVAnd using this kind of process for each of the different groups,
p351
aVwe are now up to an 80 percent success rate
p352
aVin classifying the 1.5 million images.
p353
aVAnd at this point, it's just a case
p354
aVof finding the small number that aren't classified correctly,
p355
aVand trying to understand why.
p356
aVAnd using that approach,
p357
aVby 15 minutes we get to 97 percent classification rates.
p358
aa(lp359
VSo this kind of technique could allow us to fix a major problem,
p360
aVwhich is that there's a lack of medical expertise in the world.
p361
aVThe World Economic Forum says that there's between a 10x and a 20x
p362
aVshortage of physicians in the developing world,
p363
aVand it would take about 300 years
p364
aVto train enough people to fix that problem.
p365
aVSo imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency
p366
aVusing these deep learning approaches?
p367
aa(lp368
VSo I'm very excited about the opportunities.
p369
aVI'm also concerned about the problems.
p370
aVThe problem here is that every area in blue on this map
p371
aVis somewhere where services are over 80 percent of employment.
p372
aVWhat are services?
p373
aVThese are services.
p374
aVThese are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do.
p375
aVSo 80 percent of the world's employment in the developed world
p376
aVis stuff that computers  have just learned how to do.
p377
aVWhat does that mean?
p378
aVWell, it'll be fine. They'll be replaced by other jobs.
p379
aVFor example, there will be more jobs for data scientists.
p380
aVWell, not really.
p381
aVIt doesn't take data scientists  very long to build these things.
p382
aVFor example, these four algorithms were all built by the same guy.
p383
aVSo if you think, oh,  it's all happened before,
p384
aVwe've seen the results in the past of when new things come along
p385
aVand they get replaced by new jobs,
p386
aVwhat are these new jobs going to be?
p387
aVIt's very hard for us to estimate this,
p388
aVbecause human performance grows at this gradual rate,
p389
aVbut we now have a system, deep learning,
p390
aVthat we know actually grows in capability exponentially.
p391
aVAnd we're here.
p392
aVSo currently, we see the things around us
p393
aVand we say, "Oh, computers are still pretty dumb." Right?
p394
aVBut in five years' time, computers will be off this chart.
p395
aVSo we need to be starting to think about this capability right now.
p396
aa(lp397
VWe have seen this once before, of course.
p398
aVIn the Industrial Revolution,
p399
aVwe saw a step change in capability thanks to engines.
p400
aVThe thing is, though, that after a while, things flattened out.
p401
aVThere was social disruption,
p402
aVbut once engines were used  to generate power in all the situations,
p403
aVthings really settled down.
p404
aVThe Machine Learning Revolution
p405
aVis going to be very different from the Industrial Revolution,
p406
aVbecause the Machine Learning Revolution, it never settles down.
p407
aVThe better computers get at intellectual activities,
p408
aVthe more they can build better computers to be better at intellectual capabilities,
p409
aVso this is going to be a kind of change
p410
aVthat the world has actually never experienced before,
p411
aVso your previous understanding of what's possible is different.
p412
aa(lp413
VThis is already impacting us.
p414
aVIn the last 25 years, as capital productivity has increased,
p415
aVlabor productivity has been flat, in fact even a little bit down.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo I want us to start having this discussion now.
p418
aVI know that when I often tell people about this situation,
p419
aVpeople can be quite dismissive.
p420
aVWell, computers can't really think,
p421
aVthey don't emote, they don't understand poetry,
p422
aVwe don't really understand how they work.
p423
aVSo what?
p424

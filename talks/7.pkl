V(Music: "The Sound of Silence," Simon & Garfunkel)
p5
aa(lp6
VHello voice mail, my old friend.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VI've called for tech support again.
p11
aVI ignored my boss's warning.
p12
aVI called on a Monday morning.
p13
aVNow it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold.
p14
aVI'm still on hold.
p15
aVI'm listening to the sounds of silence.
p16
aVI don't think you understand.
p17
aVI think your phone lines are unmanned.
p18
aVI punched every touch tone I was told,
p19
aVbut I've still spent 18 hours on hold.
p20
aVIt's not enough your software crashed my Mac,
p21
aVand it constantly hangs and bombs \u2014
p22
aVit erased my ROMs!
p23
aVNow the Mac makes the sounds of silence.
p24
aVIn my dreams I fantasize
p25
aVof wreaking vengeance on you guys.
p26
aVSay your motorcycle crashes.
p27
aVBlood comes gushing from your gashes.
p28
aVWith your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD.
p29
aVBut you get me.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd you listen to the sounds of silence.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Music)
p36
aa(lp37
V(Applause)
p38
aa(lp39
VThank you.
p40
aa(lp41
VGood evening and welcome to:
p42
aV"Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist."
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VWhen I was offered the Times column six years ago,
p47
aVthe deal was like this:
p48
aVyou'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets.
p49
aVEvery week, it'll arrive at your door.
p50
aVYou get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them
p51
aVuntil the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back,
p52
aVand you'll get paid for it.
p53
aVYou can think about it, if you want.
p54
aVSo, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it.
p55
aVThe job, though, came with one small downside, and that is,
p56
aVthey intended to publish my email address at the end of every column.
p57
aVAnd what I've noticed is \u2014 first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.
p58
aa(lp59
VIf you ever are feeling lonely,
p60
aVget a New York Times column,
p61
aVbecause you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails.
p62
aVAnd the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration.
p63
aVPeople are feeling like things \u2014
p64
aVOk, I just had an alarm come up on my screen.
p65
aVLucky you can't see it.
p66
aVPeople are feeling overwhelmed.
p67
aVThey're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast.
p68
aVIt may be good technology,
p69
aVbut I feel like there's not enough of a support structure.
p70
aVThere's not enough help.
p71
aVThere's not enough thought put into the design of it
p72
aVto make it easy and enjoyable to use.
p73
aVOne time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support,
p74
aVand within 12 hours, there were 700 messages
p75
aVfrom readers on the feedback boards on the Times website,
p76
aVfrom users saying,
p77
aV""Me too, and here's my tale of woe."
p78
aVI call it "software rage."
p79
aVAnd man, let me tell you,
p80
aVwhoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will \u2014
p81
aVOh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VOk, so why is the problem accelerating?
p86
aVAnd part of the problem is, ironically,
p87
aVbecause the industry has put so much thought
p88
aVinto making things easier to use.
p89
aVI'll show you what I mean.
p90
aVThis is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS.
p91
aVOver the years, it's gotten easier to use.
p92
aVThis is the original Mac operating system.
p93
aVReagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette.
p94
aVAnd the entire operating system \u2014
p95
aVthis is the good part \u2014 the entire operating system fit in 211 k.
p96
aVYou couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VSo the irony is, that as these things became easier to use,
p101
aVa less technical, broader audience was coming into contact
p102
aVwith this equipment for the first time.
p103
aa(lp104
VI once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center
p105
aVfor a day.
p106
aVThe guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to.
p107
aVAnd the calls that \u2014 you know how they say,
p108
aV"Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?"
p109
aVUh-uh.
p110
aVYour call may be recorded
p111
aVso that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories
p112
aVand pass them around on a CD.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VWhich they do.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd I have a copy.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VIt's in your gift bag. No, no.
p125
aVWith your voices on it!
p126
aa(lp127
VSo, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable.
p128
aVA woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking.
p129
aVMaking a squeaking noise.
p130
aVAnd the technician said,
p131
aa(lp132
V"Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?"
p133
aa(lp134
VShe says, "All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder,
p135
aVthe faster I move it across the screen."
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd the technician's like,
p140
aV"Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?"
p141
aa(lp142
VShe goes, "Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'"
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VWell, if you like that one \u2014 how much time have we got?
p147
aVAnother one, a guy called \u2014 this is absolutely true \u2014
p148
aVhis computer had crashed, and he told the technician
p149
aVhe couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed "11."
p150
aVAnd the technician said, "What? Why are you typing 11?"
p151
aVHe said, "The message says, 'Error Type 11.'"
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VSo, we must admit
p156
aVthat some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users.
p157
aVBut why is the technical overload crisis,
p158
aVthe complexity crisis, accelerating now?
p159
aa(lp160
VIn the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want
p161
aVeverything to be smaller, smaller, smaller.
p162
aVSo the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier,
p163
aVbut our fingers are essentially staying the same size.
p164
aVSo it gets to be more and more of a challenge.
p165
aVSoftware is subject to another primal force:
p166
aVthe mandate to release more and more versions.
p167
aVWhen you buy a piece of software,
p168
aVit's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it.
p169
aVIt's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year,
p170
aVand every year, they say,
p171
aV"We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99."
p172
aVI know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years.
p173
aVAnd software companies make 35 percent of their revenue
p174
aVfrom just these software upgrades.
p175
aVI call it the Software Upgrade Paradox \u2014
p176
aVwhich is that if you improve a piece of software enough times,
p177
aVyou eventually ruin it.
p178
aa(lp179
VI mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know,
p180
aVthe Eisenhower administration.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VBut what's the alternative?
p185
aVMicrosoft actually did this experiment.
p186
aVThey said, "Well, wait a minute.
p187
aVEveryone complains that we're adding so many features.
p188
aVLet's create a word processor that's just a word processor:
p189
aVSimple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database."
p190
aVAnd it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write.
p191
aVAnd none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died.
p192
aVIt tanked. No one ever bought it.
p193
aVI call this the Sport Utility Principle.
p194
aVPeople like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right?
p195
aVThey don't need the database and the website, but they're like,
p196
aV"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday."
p197
aVSo the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go?
p198
aVWhere are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools.
p199
aVYou can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.
p200
aVBut if you're not careful about how you choose,
p201
aVyou wind up with this.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VThis is an un-retouched \u2014 this is not a joke \u2014
p206
aVun-retouched photo of Microsoft Word,
p207
aVthe copy that you have, with all the toolbars open.
p208
aVYou've obviously never opened all the toolbars,
p209
aVbut all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd we've arrived at the age of interface matrices,
p214
aVwhere there are so many features and options,
p215
aVyou have to do two dimensions, you know:
p216
aVa vertical and a horizontal.
p217
aVYou guys all complain
p218
aVabout how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists
p219
aVand underlining your links automatically.
p220
aVThe off switch is in there somewhere.
p221
aVI'm telling you \u2014 it's there.
p222
aVPart of the art of designing a simple, good interface,
p223
aVis knowing when to use which one of these features.
p224
aVSo, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000.
p225
aVThere are only four choices,
p226
aVso why are they in a pop-up menu?
p227
aVIt's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components
p228
aVthat you need to collapse the choices.
p229
aVThey could have put them all out in view.
p230
aa(lp231
VHere's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
VThank you \u2014 yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no.
p236
aVAlready, we can see that Apple and Microsoft
p237
aVhave a severely divergent approach to software design.
p238
aVMicrosoft's approach to simplicity tends to be:
p239
aVlet's break it down; let's just make it more steps.
p240
aVThere are these "wizards" everywhere.
p241
aVAnd you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall.
p242
aVIf they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling
p243
aVwhere they might wind up.
p244
aa(lp245
V[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard]
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
V(Applause)
p250
aa(lp251
V"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard."
p252
aVOk, I'll bite.
p253
aVLet's click "Next" to continue.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
V(Applause)
p258
aa(lp259
VFrom the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VSo there is a limit that we don't want to cross.
p264
aVSo what is the answer?
p265
aVHow do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way?
p266
aVI believe in consistency, when possible,
p267
aVreal-world equivalents,
p268
aVtrash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly.
p269
aVBut I beg of the designers here
p270
aVto break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all,
p271
aVwhich is intelligence.
p272
aVNow what do I mean by that?
p273
aVI'm going to give you some examples
p274
aVwhere intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.
p275
aa(lp276
VIf you are buying something on the web,
p277
aVyou're supposed to put in your address,
p278
aVand you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok?
p279
aVThere are 200 countries in the world.
p280
aVWe like to think of the Internet as a global village.
p281
aVI'm sorry; it's not one yet.
p282
aVIt's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan.
p283
aVSo why is "United States" in the "U"s?
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VYou have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it.
p288
aVNow, it would be inconsistent to put "United States" first,
p289
aVbut it would be intelligent.
p290
aa(lp291
VThis one's been touched on before,
p292
aVbut why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC
p293
aVby clicking a button called "Start?"
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VHere's another pet one of mine: you have a printer.
p298
aVMost of the time, you want to print one copy of your document,
p299
aVin page order, on that printer.
p300
aVSo why in God's name do you see this every time you print?
p301
aVIt's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not "Print."
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
V(Applause)
p310
aa(lp311
VNow, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced
p312
aVthe cult of simplicity.
p313
aVPalm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this.
p314
aVI actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s,
p315
aVand after the talk, I met one of the employees.
p316
aVHe says, "Nice talk." And I said, "Thank you. What do you do here?"
p317
aVHe said, "I'm a tap counter." I'm like, "You're a what?"
p318
aVHe goes, "Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says,
p319
aV'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus,
p320
aVit's too long, and it has to be redesigned.'
p321
aVSo I'm the tap counter."
p322
aVSo, I'm going to show you an example
p323
aVof a company that does not have a tap counter.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
VThis is Microsoft Word.
p328
aVOk, when you want to create a new blank document in Word \u2014
p329
aVit could happen.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VYou go up to the "File" menu and you choose "New."
p334
aVNow, what happens when you choose "New?"
p335
aVDo you get a new blank document?
p336
aVYou do not.
p337
aVOn the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears,
p338
aVand somewhere in those links \u2014 by the way, not at the top \u2014
p339
aVsomewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document.
p340
aVOk, so that is a company not counting taps.
p341
aVYou know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ...
p342
aVYes, I do.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
V(Applause)
p347
aa(lp348
VThe Bill Gates song!
p349
aa(lp350
V(Piano music)
p351
aa(lp352
VI've been a geek forever
p353
aVand I wrote the very first DOS.
p354
aVI put my software and IBM together;
p355
aVI got profit and they got the loss.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VI write the code that makes the whole world run.
p360
aVI'm getting royalties from everyone.
p361
aVSometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed.
p362
aVYou buy the box; I'll sell the code.
p363
aVEvery software company is doing Microsoft's R&D.
p364
aVYou can't keep a good idea down these days.
p365
aVEven Windows is a hack.
p366
aVWe're kind of based loosely on the Mac.
p367
aVSo it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go.
p368
aVI'm not doing this for praise.
p369
aVI write the code that fits the world today.
p370
aVBig mediocrity in every way.
p371
aVWe've entered planet domination mode.
p372
aVYou'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.
p373
aVI am Bill Gates and I write the code.
p374
aa(lp375
V(Applause)
p376
aa(lp377
VBut actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts.
p378
aVThere's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office.
p379
aVThey're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't.
p380
aVThey're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff
p381
aVlocks into the old 1982 chassis.
p382
aVBut there's also a new Microsoft,
p383
aVthat's really doing good, simple interface designs.
p384
aVI liked the Media Center PC.
p385
aVI liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.
p386
aVThe Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market,
p387
aVbut it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed.
p388
aVBut let's put it this way:
p389
aVwould you pay $10 a month to have a watch
p390
aVthat has to be recharged every night like your cell phone,
p391
aVand stops working when you leave your area code?
p392
aa(lp393
V(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VSo, the signs might indicate
p396
aVthat the complexity crunch is only going to get worse.
p397
aVSo is there any hope?
p398
aVThe screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating,
p399
aVputting manuals in the boxes,
p400
aVthings are coming out at a faster pace.
p401
aVIt's funny \u2014 when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997,
p402
aVafter 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo \u2014
p403
aVhe came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans,
p404
aVand he sort of did this.
p405
aVThe crowd went wild, but I had just seen \u2014
p406
aVI'm like, where have I seen this before?
p407
aVI had just seen the movie "Evita" \u2014
p408
aa(lp409
V(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
Vwith Madonna,
p412
aVand I'm like, you know what?
p413
aVI've got to do one about Steve Jobs.
p414
aa(lp415
V(Music)
p416
aa(lp417
VIt won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange.
p418
aa(lp419
V(Laughter)
p420
aa(lp421
VWhen I try to explain why I'm back,
p422
aVafter telling the press Apple's future is black.
p423
aVYou won't believe me.
p424
aVAll that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage
p425
aVwith only a buddy named Woz.
p426
aa(lp427
V(Laughter)
p428
aa(lp429
VYou try rhyming with garage!
p430
aa(lp431
V(Laughter)
p432
aa(lp433
VDon't cry for me, Cupertino.
p434
aa(lp435
V(Laughter)
p436
aa(lp437
VThe truth is, I never left you.
p438
aVI know the ropes now, know what the tricks are.
p439
aVI made a fortune over at Pixar.
p440
aa(lp441
V(Laughter)
p442
aa(lp443
VDon't cry for me, Cupertino.
p444
aVI've still got the drive and vision.
p445
aVI still wear sandals in any weather.
p446
aVIt's just that these days,
p447
aVthey're Gucci leather.
p448
aa(lp449
V(Laughter)
p450
aa(lp451
V(Applause)
p452
aa(lp453
VThank you.
p454
aa(lp455
VSo Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty.
p456
aVAnd the truth is,
p457
aVfor years I was a little depressed,
p458
aVbecause Americans obviously did not value it,
p459
aVbecause the Mac had three percent market share,
p460
aVWindows had 95 percent market share \u2014
p461
aVpeople did not think it was worth putting a price on it.
p462
aVSo I was a little depressed.
p463
aVAnd then I heard Al Gore's talk,
p464
aVand I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.
p465
aa(lp466
V(Laughter)
p467
aa(lp468
VBut it turns out I was wrong, right?
p469
aVBecause the iPod came out,
p470
aVand it violated every bit of common wisdom.
p471
aVOther products cost less; other products had more features,
p472
aVthey had voice recorders and FM transmitters.
p473
aVThe other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard,
p474
aVnot Apple's propriety standard.
p475
aVBut the iPod won \u2014 this is the one they wanted.
p476
aVThe lesson was: simplicity sells.
p477
aVAnd there are signs that the industry is getting the message.
p478
aVThis is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance.
p479
aVThe Sonos thing \u2014 it's catching on.
p480

VI've got just a couple examples.
p482
aVPhysically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately.
p483
aVWhen you have a digital camera,
p484
aVhow do you get the pictures back to your computer?
p485
aVWell, you either haul around a USB cable,
p486
aVor you buy a card reader and haul that around.
p487
aVEither one, you're going to lose.
p488
aVWhat I do is, I take out the memory card,
p489
aVand I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.
p490
aVI just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures,
p491
aVput it right back in the camera.
p492
aVI never have to lose anything.
p493
aVHere's another example.
p494
aVChris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug?
p495
aa(lp496
VChris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go.
p497
aVYou might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop.
p498
aVThis the power cord. It hooks on like this.
p499
aVAnd I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives,
p500
aVor one of your children.
p501
aVYou walk along \u2014 and I'm about to pull this onto the floor.
p502
aVI don't care. It's a loaner.
p503
aVHere we go. Whoa!
p504
aVIt's magnetic \u2014 it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.
p505
aa(lp506
V(Applause)
p507
aa(lp508
VIn my very last example \u2014
p509
aVI do a lot of my work using speech recognition software.
p510
aVAnd I'll just \u2014 you have to be kind of quiet
p511
aVbecause the software is nervous.
p512
aVSpeech recognition software is really great
p513
aVfor doing emails very quickly; period.
p514
aVLike, I get hundreds of them a day; period.
p515
aVAnd it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period.
p516
aVI also use this feature called voice macros; period.
p517
aVCorrect "dissuade."
p518
aVNot "just."
p519
aVOk, this is not an ideal situation,
p520
aVbecause it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff.
p521
aVThe point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word,
p522
aVand having it write out a much longer thing.
p523
aVSo if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say,
p524
aV"Thanks for that."
p525
aa(lp526
V[Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...]
p527
aa(lp528
V(Laughter)
p529
aa(lp530
V(Applause)
p531
aa(lp532
VAnd conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail \u2014
p533
aVwhich happens daily \u2014
p534
aVI say, "Piss off."
p535
aa(lp536
V(Laughter)
p537
aa(lp538
V[I admire your frankness ...]
p539
aa(lp540
V(Laughter)
p541
aa(lp542
V(Applause)
p543
aa(lp544
VSo that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.
p545
aa(lp546
V(Laughter)
p547
aa(lp548
VSo the point is \u2014 this is a really interesting story.
p549
aVThis is version eight of this software,
p550
aVand do you know what they put in version eight?
p551
aVNo new features. It's never happened before in software!
p552
aVThe company put no new features.
p553
aVThey just said, "We'll make this software work right." Right?
p554
aVBecause for years, people had bought this software, tried it out \u2014
p555
aV95 percent accuracy was all they got,
p556
aVwhich means one in 20 words is wrong \u2014
p557
aVand they'd put it in their drawer.
p558
aVAnd the company got sick of that,
p559
aVso they said, "This version, we're not going to do anything,
p560
aVbut make sure it's darned accurate."
p561
aVAnd so that's what they did.
p562
aa(lp563
VThis cult of doing things right is starting to spread.
p564
aVSo, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology:
p565
aVremember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok?
p566
aVIt could be the design of the thing you're using.
p567
aVBe aware in life of good design and bad design.
p568
aVAnd if you're among the people who create this stuff:
p569
aVEasy is hard.
p570
aVPre-sweat the details for your audience.
p571
aVCount the taps.
p572
aVRemember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add,
p573
aVit's deciding what to leave out.
p574
aVAnd best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells.
p575
aa(lp576
VCA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much.
p577
aa(lp578
VCA: Hear, hear!

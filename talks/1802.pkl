VMotor racing is a funny old business.
p5
aVWe make a new car every year,
p6
aVand then we spend the rest of the season
p7
aVtrying to understand what it is we've built
p8
aVto make it better, to make it faster.
p9
aVAnd then the next year, we start again.
p10
aVNow, the car you see in front of you is quite complicated.
p11
aVThe chassis is made up of about 11,000 components,
p12
aVthe engine another 6,000,
p13
aVthe electronics about eight and a half thousand.
p14
aVSo there's about 25,000 things there that can go wrong.
p15
aVSo motor racing is very much about attention to detail.
p16
aVThe other thing about Formula 1 in particular
p17
aVis we're always changing the car.
p18
aVWe're always trying to make it faster.
p19
aVSo every two weeks, we will be making
p20
aVabout 5,000 new components to fit to the car.
p21
aVFive to 10 percent of the race car
p22
aVwill be different every two weeks of the year.
p23
aVSo how do we do that?
p24
aVWell, we start our life with the racing car.
p25
aVWe have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things.
p26
aVOn the race car in front of you here
p27
aVthere are about 120 sensors when it goes into a race.
p28
aVIt's measuring all sorts of things around the car.
p29
aVThat data is logged. We're logging about
p30
aV500 different parameters within the data systems,
p31
aVabout 13,000 health parameters and events
p32
aVto say when things are not working the way they should do,
p33
aVand we're sending that data back to the garage
p34
aVusing telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second.
p35
aVSo during a two-hour race, each car will be sending
p36
aV750 million numbers.
p37
aVThat's twice as many numbers as words that each of us
p38
aVspeaks in a lifetime.
p39
aVIt's a huge amount of data.
p40
aVBut it's not enough just to have data and measure it.
p41
aVYou need to be able to do something with it.
p42
aVSo we've spent a lot of time and effort
p43
aVin turning the data into stories
p44
aVto be able to tell, what's the state of the engine,
p45
aVhow are the tires degrading,
p46
aVwhat's the situation with fuel consumption?
p47
aVSo all of this is taking data
p48
aVand turning it into knowledge that we can act upon.
p49
aVOkay, so let's have a look at a little bit of data.
p50
aVLet's pick a bit of data from
p51
aVanother three-month-old patient.
p52
aVThis is a child, and what you're seeing here is real data,
p53
aVand on the far right-hand side,
p54
aVwhere everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic,
p55
aVthat is the patient going into cardiac arrest.
p56
aVIt was deemed to be an unpredictable event.
p57
aVThis was a heart attack that no one could see coming.
p58
aVBut when we look at the information there,
p59
aVwe can see that things are starting to become
p60
aVa little fuzzy about five minutes or so before the cardiac arrest.
p61
aVWe can see small changes
p62
aVin things like the heart rate moving.
p63
aVThese were all undetected by normal thresholds
p64
aVwhich would be applied to data.
p65
aVSo the question is, why couldn't we see it?
p66
aVWas this a predictable event?
p67
aVCan we look more at the patterns in the data
p68
aVto be able to do things better?
p69
aVSo this is a child,
p70
aVabout the same age as the racing car on stage,
p71
aVthree months old.
p72
aVIt's a patient with a heart problem.
p73
aVNow, when you look at some of the data on the screen above,
p74
aVthings like heart rate, pulse, oxygen, respiration rates,
p75
aVthey're all unusual for a normal child,
p76
aVbut they're quite normal for the child there,
p77
aVand so one of the challenges you have in health care is,
p78
aVhow can I look at the patient in front of me,
p79
aVhave something which is specific for her,
p80
aVand be able to detect when things start to change,
p81
aVwhen things start to deteriorate?
p82
aVBecause like a racing car, any patient,
p83
aVwhen things start to go bad, you have a short time
p84
aVto make a difference.
p85
aVSo what we did is we took a data system
p86
aVwhich we run every two weeks of the year in Formula 1
p87
aVand we installed it on the hospital computers
p88
aVat Birmingham Children's Hospital.
p89
aVWe streamed data from the bedside instruments
p90
aVin their pediatric intensive care
p91
aVso that we could both look at the data in real time
p92
aVand, more importantly, to store the data
p93
aVso that we could start to learn from it.
p94
aVAnd then, we applied an application on top
p95
aVwhich would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data
p96
aVin real time so we could see what was happening,
p97
aVso we could determine when things started to change.
p98
aVNow, in motor racing, we're all a little bit ambitious,
p99
aVaudacious, a little bit arrogant sometimes,
p100
aVso we decided we would also look at the children
p101
aVas they were being transported to intensive care.
p102
aVWhy should we wait until they arrived in the hospital
p103
aVbefore we started to look?
p104
aVAnd so we installed a real-time link
p105
aVbetween the ambulance and the hospital,
p106
aVjust using normal 3G telephony to send that data
p107
aVso that the ambulance became an extra bed
p108
aVin intensive care.
p109
aVAnd then we started looking at the data.
p110
aVSo the wiggly lines at the top, all the colors,
p111
aVthis is the normal sort of data you would see on a monitor \u2014
p112
aVheart rate, pulse, oxygen within the blood,
p113
aVand respiration.
p114
aVThe lines on the bottom, the blue and the red,
p115
aVthese are the interesting ones.
p116
aVThe red line is showing an automated version
p117
aVof the early warning score
p118
aVthat Birmingham Children's Hospital were already running.
p119
aVThey'd been running that since 2008,
p120
aVand already have stopped cardiac arrests
p121
aVand distress within the hospital.
p122
aVThe blue line is an indication
p123
aVof when patterns start to change,
p124
aVand immediately, before we even started
p125
aVputting in clinical interpretation,
p126
aVwe can see that the data is speaking to us.
p127
aVIt's telling us that something is going wrong.
p128
aVThe plot with the red and the green blobs,
p129
aVthis is plotting different components
p130
aVof the data against each other.
p131
aVThe green is us learning what is normal for that child.
p132
aVWe call it the cloud of normality.
p133
aVAnd when things start to change,
p134
aVwhen conditions start to deteriorate,
p135
aVwe move into the red line.
p136
aVThere's no rocket science here.
p137
aVIt is displaying data that exists already in a different way,
p138
aVto amplify it, to provide cues to the doctors,
p139
aVto the nurses, so they can see what's happening.
p140
aVIn the same way that a good racing driver
p141
aVrelies on cues to decide when to apply the brakes,
p142
aVwhen to turn into a corner,
p143
aVwe need to help our physicians and our nurses
p144
aVto see when things are starting to go wrong.
p145
aVSo we have a very ambitious program.
p146
aVWe think that the race is on to do something differently.
p147
aVWe are thinking big. It's the right thing to do.
p148
aVWe have an approach which, if it's successful,
p149
aVthere's no reason why it should stay within a hospital.
p150
aVIt can go beyond the walls.
p151
aVWith wireless connectivity these days,
p152
aVthere is no reason why patients, doctors and nurses
p153
aValways have to be in the same place
p154
aVat the same time.
p155
aVAnd meanwhile, we'll take our little three-month-old baby,
p156
aVkeep taking it to the track, keeping it safe,
p157
aVand making it faster and better.
p158
aVThank you very much.

Manen has a high-speed job would be an understatement. As Managing Director of McLaren Electronics, which provides electronics and data collection software to motorsports events, he and his team work in real time during a race to improve cars on about 500 different parameters. That&#39;s about 750 million data points in two hours.</p><p>But recently van Manen and his team have been wondering: Why can&#39;t the extremely precise and subtle data-collection and analysis systems used in motorsports be applied elsewhere, for the benefit of all? They have applied their systems to ICU units at Birmingham Children&#39;s Hospital with real-time analysis that allows them to proactively prevent cardiac arrests. The unit has seen a 25 percent decrease in life-threatening events.

VI wanted to just start by asking everyone a question:
p5
aVHow many of you are completely comfortable
p6
aVwith calling yourselves a leader?
p7
aVI've asked that question all across the country,
p8
aVand everywhere I ask it, no matter where,
p9
aVthere's a huge portion of the audience that won't put up their hand.
p10
aVAnd I've come to realize that we have made leadership
p11
aVinto something bigger than us; something beyond us.
p12
aVWe've made it about changing the world.
p13
aVWe've taken this title of "leader"
p14
aVand treat it as something that one day we're going to deserve.
p15
aVBut to give it to ourselves right now
p16
aVmeans a level of arrogance or cockiness that we're not comfortable with.
p17
aVAnd I worry sometimes that we spend so much time
p18
aVcelebrating amazing things that hardly anybody can do,
p19
aVthat we've convinced ourselves those are the only things worth celebrating.
p20
aVWe start to devalue the things we can do every day,
p21
aVWe take moments where we truly are a leader
p22
aVand we don't let ourselves take credit for it, or feel good about it.
p23
aVI've been lucky enough over the last 10 years
p24
aVto work with amazing people who've helped me redefine leadership
p25
aVin a way that I think has made me happier.
p26
aVWith my short time today,
p27
aVI want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible
p28
aVfor that redefinition.
p29
aa(lp30
VI went to a little school
p31
aVcalled Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick.
p32
aVAnd on my last day there, a girl came up to me and said,
p33
aV"I remember the first time I met you."
p34
aVAnd she told me a story that had happened four years earlier.
p35
aVShe said, "On the day before I started university,
p36
aVI was in the hotel room with my mom and dad,
p37
aVand I was so scared and so convinced that I couldn't do this,
p38
aVthat I wasn't ready for university, that I just burst into tears.
p39
aVMy mom and dad were amazing.
p40
aVThey were like, "We know you're scared, but let's just go tomorrow,
p41
aVgo to the first day, and if at any point you feel as if you can't do this,
p42
aVthat's fine; tell us, and we'll take you home.
p43
aVWe love you no matter what.'"
p44
aa(lp45
VShe says, "So I went the next day.
p46
aVI was in line for registration,
p47
aVand I looked around and just knew I couldn't do it; I wasn't ready.
p48
aVI knew I had to quit.
p49
aVI made that decision and as soon as I made it,
p50
aVan incredible feeling of peace came over me.
p51
aVI turned to my mom and dad to tell them we needed to go home,
p52
aVand at that moment, you came out of the student union building
p53
aVwearing the stupidest hat I've ever seen in my life."
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
V"It was awesome.
p58
aVAnd you had a big sign promoting Shinerama," \u2014
p59
aVwhich is Students Fighting Cystic Fibrosis,
p60
aVa charity I've worked with for years \u2014
p61
aV"And you had a bucketful of lollipops.
p62
aVYou were handing the lollipops out to people in line,
p63
aVand talking about Shinerama.
p64
aVAll of the sudden, you got to me, and you just stopped.
p65
aVAnd you stared. It was creepy."
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VThis girl knows what I'm talking about.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
V"Then you looked at the guy next to me, smiled, reached into your bucket,
p74
aVpulled out a lollipop, held it out to him and said,
p75
aV'You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman next to you.'"
p76
aVShe said, "I've never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life.
p77
aVHe turned beet red, he wouldn't even look at me.
p78
aVHe just kind of held the lollipop out like this."
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
V"I felt so bad for this dude that I took the lollipop.
p83
aVAs soon as I did, you got this incredibly severe look on your face,
p84
aVlooked at my mom and dad and said, 'Look at that! Look at that!
p85
aVFirst day away from home,
p86
aVand already she's taking candy from a stranger?'"
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VShe said, "Everybody lost it.
p91
aVTwenty feet in every direction, everyone started to howl.
p92
aVI know this is cheesy, and I don't know why I'm telling you this,
p93
aVbut in that moment when everyone was laughing, I knew I shouldn't quit.
p94
aVI knew I was where I was supposed to be; I knew I was home.
p95
aVAnd I haven't spoken to you once in the four years since that day.
p96
aVBut I heard that you were leaving, and I had to come and tell you
p97
aVyou've been an incredibly important person in my life.
p98
aVI'm going to miss you. Good luck."
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd she walks away, and I'm flattened.
p101
aVShe gets six feet away, turns around, smiles and goes,
p102
aV"You should probably know this, too:
p103
aVI'm still dating that guy, four years later."
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VA year and a half after I moved to Toronto,
p108
aVI got an invitation to their wedding.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VHere's the kicker: I don't remember that.
p113
aVI have no recollection of that moment.
p114
aVI've searched my memory banks,
p115
aVbecause that is funny and I should remember doing it and I don't.
p116
aVThat was such an eye-opening, transformative moment for me,
p117
aVto think that maybe the biggest impact I'd ever had on anyone's life,
p118
aVa moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say,
p119
aV"You've been an important person in my life,"
p120
aVwas a moment that I didn't even remember.
p121
aa(lp122
VHow many of you guys have a lollipop moment,
p123
aVa moment where someone said or did something
p124
aVthat you feel fundamentally made your life better?
p125
aVAll right. How many of you have told that person they did it?
p126
aVSee, why not?
p127
aVWe celebrate birthdays,
p128
aVwhere all you have to do is not die for 365 days \u2014
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VYet we let people who have made our lives better
p133
aVwalk around without knowing it.
p134
aVEvery single one of you has been the catalyst
p135
aVfor a lollipop moment.
p136
aVYou've made someone's life better by something you said or did.
p137
aVIf you think you haven't,
p138
aVthink of all the hands that didn't go up when I asked.
p139
aVYou're just one of the people who hasn't been told.
p140
aa(lp141
VIt's scary to think of ourselves as that powerful,
p142
aVfrightening to think we can matter that much to other people.
p143
aVAs long as we make leadership something bigger than us,
p144
aVas long as we keep leadership beyond us
p145
aVand make it about changing the world,
p146
aVwe give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day,
p147
aVfrom ourselves and from each other.
p148
aa(lp149
VMarianne Williamson said, "Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate.
p150
aV[It] is that we are powerful beyond measure.
p151
aVIt is our light and not our darkness that frightens us."
p152
aVMy call to action today is that we need to get over our fear
p153
aVof how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other's lives.
p154
aVWe need to get over it so we can move beyond it,
p155
aVand our little brothers and sisters and one day our kids \u2014
p156
aVor our kids right now \u2014 can watch and start to value
p157
aVthe impact we can have on each other's lives,
p158
aVmore than money and power and titles and influence.
p159
aVWe need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments \u2014
p160
aVhow many of them we create, how many we acknowledge,
p161
aVhow many of them we pay forward and how many we say thank you for.
p162
aVBecause we've made leadership about changing the world,
p163
aVand there is no world.
p164
aVThere's only six billion understandings of it.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd if you change one person's understanding of it,
p167
aVunderstanding of what they're capable of,
p168
aVunderstanding of how much people care about them,
p169
aVunderstanding of how powerful an agent for change
p170
aVthey can be in this world,
p171
aVyou've changed the whole thing.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd if we can understand leadership like that,
p174
aVI think if we can redefine leadership like that,
p175
aVI think we can change everything.
p176
aVAnd it's a simple idea, but I don't think it's a small one.
p177
aVI want to thank you so much for letting me share it with you today.

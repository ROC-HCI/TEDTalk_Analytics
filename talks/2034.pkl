VThe human voice:
p5
aVIt's the instrument we all play.
p6
aVIt's the most powerful sound in the world, probably.
p7
aVIt's the only one that can start a war or say "I love you."
p8
aVAnd yet many people have the experience
p9
aVthat when they speak, people don't listen to them.
p10
aVAnd why is that?
p11
aVHow can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?
p12
aa(lp13
VWhat I'd like to suggest,
p14
aVthere are a number of habits that we need to move away from.
p15
aVI've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking.
p16
aVI'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list,
p17
aVbut these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.
p18
aa(lp19
VFirst, gossip.
p20
aVSpeaking ill of somebody who's not present.
p21
aVNot a nice habit, and we know perfectly well
p22
aVthe person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us.
p23
aa(lp24
VSecond, judging.
p25
aVWe know people who are like this in conversation,
p26
aVand it's very hard to listen to somebody
p27
aVif you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time.
p28
aa(lp29
VThird, negativity.
p30
aVYou can fall into this.
p31
aVMy mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative,
p32
aVand it's hard to listen.
p33
aVI remember one day, I said to her, "It's October 1 today,"
p34
aVand she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?"
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VIt's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd another form of negativity, complaining.
p43
aVWell, this is the national art of the U.K.
p44
aVIt's our national sport.
p45
aVWe complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything,
p46
aVbut actually, complaining is viral misery.
p47
aVIt's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.
p48
aa(lp49
VExcuses.
p50
aa(lp51
VWe've all met this guy.
p52
aVMaybe we've all been this guy.
p53
aVSome people have a blamethrower.
p54
aVThey just pass it on to everybody else
p55
aVand don't take responsibility for their actions,
p56
aVand again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that.
p57
aa(lp58
VPenultimate, the sixth of the seven,
p59
aVembroidery, exaggeration.
p60
aVIt demeans our language, actually, sometimes.
p61
aVFor example, if I see something that really is awesome,
p62
aVwhat do I call it?
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying,
p67
aVand we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd finally, dogmatism.
p70
aVThe confusion of facts with opinions.
p71
aVWhen those two things get conflated,
p72
aVyou're listening into the wind.
p73
aVYou know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true.
p74
aVIt's difficult to listen to that.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking.
p77
aVThese are things I think we need to avoid.
p78
aVBut is there a positive way to think about this?
p79
aVYes, there is.
p80
aVI'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations,
p81
aVthat we can stand on if we want our speech
p82
aVto be powerful and to make change in the world.
p83
aVFortunately, these things spell a word.
p84
aVThe word is "hail," and it has a great definition as well.
p85
aVI'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky
p86
aVand hits you on the head.
p87
aVI'm talking about this definition,
p88
aVto greet or acclaim enthusiastically,
p89
aVwhich is how I think our words will be received
p90
aVif we stand on these four things.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo what do they stand for?
p93
aVSee if you can guess.
p94
aVThe H, honesty, of course,
p95
aVbeing true in what you say, being straight and clear.
p96
aVThe A is authenticity, just being yourself.
p97
aVA friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth,
p98
aVwhich I think is a lovely way to put it.
p99
aVThe I is integrity, being your word,
p100
aVactually doing what you say,
p101
aVand being somebody people can trust.
p102
aVAnd the L is love.
p103
aVI don't mean romantic love,
p104
aVbut I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons.
p105
aVFirst of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want.
p106
aVI mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning.
p107
aVPerhaps that's not necessary.
p108
aVTempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing.
p109
aVBut also, if you're really wishing somebody well,
p110
aVit's very hard to judge them at the same time.
p111
aVI'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously.
p112
aVSo hail.
p113
aa(lp114
VAlso, now that's what you say,
p115
aVand it's like the old song, it is what you say,
p116
aVit's also the way that you say it.
p117
aVYou have an amazing toolbox.
p118
aVThis instrument is incredible,
p119
aVand yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened.
p120
aVI'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now
p121
aVand just pull a few tools out
p122
aVthat you might like to take away and play with,
p123
aVwhich will increase the power of your speaking.
p124
aa(lp125
VRegister, for example.
p126
aVNow, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time,
p127
aVbut there's a register in between.
p128
aVI'm not going to get very technical about this
p129
aVfor any of you who are voice coaches.
p130
aVYou can locate your voice, however.
p131
aVSo if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference.
p132
aVIf I go down here in my throat,
p133
aVwhich is where most of us speak from most of the time.
p134
aVBut if you want weight,
p135
aVyou need to go down here to the chest.
p136
aVYou hear the difference?
p137
aVWe vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true,
p138
aVbecause we associate depth with power
p139
aVand with authority.
p140
aVThat's register.
p141
aa(lp142
VThen we have timbre.
p143
aVIt's the way your voice feels.
p144
aVAgain, the research shows
p145
aVthat we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm,
p146
aVlike hot chocolate.
p147
aVWell if that's not you, that's not the end of the world,
p148
aVbecause you can train.
p149
aVGo and get a voice coach.
p150
aVAnd there are amazing things you can do
p151
aVwith breathing, with posture, and with exercises
p152
aVto improve the timbre of your voice.
p153
aa(lp154
VThen prosody. I love prosody.
p155
aVThis is the sing-song, the meta-language
p156
aVthat we use in order to impart meaning.
p157
aVIt's root one for meaning in conversation.
p158
aVPeople who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to
p159
aVif they don't have any prosody at all.
p160
aVThat's where the word "monotonic" comes from,
p161
aVor monotonous, monotone.
p162
aVAlso, we have repetitive prosody now coming in,
p163
aVwhere every sentence ends as if it were a question
p164
aVwhen it's actually not a question, it's a statement?
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd if you repeat that one,
p169
aVit's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody,
p170
aVwhich I think is a shame,
p171
aVso let's try and break that habit.
p172
aa(lp173
VPace.
p174
aa(lp175
VI can get very excited by saying something really quickly,
p176
aVor I can slow right down to emphasize,
p177
aVand at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.
p178
aVThere's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there?
p179
aVWe don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.
p180
aVIt can be very powerful.
p181
aa(lp182
VOf course, pitch often goes along with pace
p183
aVto indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch.
p184
aVWhere did you leave my keys?
p185
aV(Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys?
p186
aVSo, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd finally, volume.
p189
aV(Loud) I can get really excited by using volume.
p190
aVSorry about that, if I startled anybody.
p191
aVOr, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet.
p192
aVSome people broadcast the whole time.
p193
aVTry not to do that.
p194
aVThat's called sodcasting,
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VImposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately.
p199
aVNot nice.
p200
aa(lp201
VOf course, where this all comes into play most of all
p202
aVis when you've got something really important to do.
p203
aVIt might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people.
p204
aVIt might be proposing marriage,
p205
aVasking for a raise, a wedding speech.
p206
aVWhatever it is, if it's really important,
p207
aVyou owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox
p208
aVand the engine that it's going to work on,
p209
aVand no engine works well without being warmed up.
p210
aVWarm up your voice.
p211
aa(lp212
VActually, let me show you how to do that.
p213
aVWould you all like to stand up for a moment?
p214
aVI'm going to show you
p215
aVthe six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.
p216
aVAny time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these.
p217
aVFirst, arms up, deep breath in,
p218
aVand sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.
p219
aVOne more time.
p220
aVAhhhh, very good.
p221
aVNow we're going to warm up our lips,
p222
aVand we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba,
p223
aVBa, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good.
p224
aVAnd now, brrrrrrrrrr,
p225
aVjust like when you were a kid.
p226
aVBrrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive.
p227
aVWe're going to do the tongue next
p228
aVwith exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
p229
aVBeautiful. You're getting really good at this.
p230
aVAnd then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.
p231
aVThat's like champagne for the tongue.
p232
aVFinally, and if I can only do one,
p233
aVthe pros call this the siren.
p234
aVIt's really good. It starts with "we" and goes to "aw."
p235
aVThe "we" is high, the "aw" is low.
p236
aVSo you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.
p237
aa(lp238
VFantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause.
p239
aVTake a seat, thank you.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Applause)
p242
aa(lp243
VNext time you speak, do those in advance.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow let me just put this in context to close.
p246
aVThis is a serious point here.
p247
aVThis is where we are now, right?
p248
aVWe speak not very well
p249
aVto people who simply aren't listening
p250
aVin an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics.
p251
aVI have talked about that on this stage in different phases.
p252
aVWhat would the world be like
p253
aVif we were speaking powerfully
p254
aVto people who were listening consciously
p255
aVin environments which were actually fit for purpose?
p256
aVOr to make that a bit larger,
p257
aVwhat would the world be like
p258
aVif we were creating sound consciously
p259
aVand consuming sound consciously
p260
aVand designing all our environments
p261
aVconsciously for sound?
p262
aVThat would be a world that does sound beautiful,
p263
aVand one where understanding would be the norm,
p264
aVand that is an idea worth spreading.
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)

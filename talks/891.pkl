VI'm going to begin by reciting a poem.
p5
aV"Oh beloved dentist:
p6
aVYour rubber fingers in my mouth ...
p7
aVyour voice so soft and muffled ...
p8
aVLower the mask, dear dentist,
p9
aVlower the mask."
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VOkay, in this presentation,
p14
aVI'm going to be putting the right side of your brains
p15
aVthrough a fairly serious workout.
p16
aVYou're going to see a lot of imagery,
p17
aVand it's not always connected to what I'm talking about,
p18
aVso I need you to kind of split your brains in half
p19
aVand let the images flow over one side
p20
aVand listen to me on the other.
p21
aVSo I am one of those people
p22
aVwith a transformative personal story.
p23
aVSix years ago,
p24
aVafter 20 years in graphic design and typography,
p25
aVI changed the way I was working
p26
aVand the way most graphic designers work
p27
aVto pursue a more personal approach to my work,
p28
aVwith only the humble attempt
p29
aVto simply make a living doing something that I loved.
p30
aVBut something weird happened.
p31
aVI became bizarrely
p32
aVpopular.
p33
aVMy current work
p34
aVseems to resonate with people
p35
aVin a way that has so taken me by surprise
p36
aVthat I still frequently wonder
p37
aVwhat in the hell is going on.
p38
aVAnd I'm slowly coming to understand
p39
aVthat the appeal of what I do
p40
aVmay be connected to why I do it.
p41
aa(lp42
VThese days, I call myself a graphic artist.
p43
aVSo where my work as a graphic designer
p44
aVwas to follow strategy,
p45
aVmy work now
p46
aVfollows my heart
p47
aVand my interests
p48
aVwith the guidance of my ego
p49
aVto create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.
p50
aVNow, this is heresy
p51
aVin the design world.
p52
aVThe ego is not supposed
p53
aVto be involved in graphic design.
p54
aVBut I find that for myself,
p55
aVwithout exception,
p56
aVthe more I deal with the work
p57
aVas something of my own,
p58
aVas something that is personal,
p59
aVthe more successful it is
p60
aVas something that's compelling,
p61
aVinteresting and sustaining.
p62
aVSo I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream
p63
aVof design thinking.
p64
aVWhere others might look at measurable results,
p65
aVI tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities,
p66
aVlike "Does it bring joy?"
p67
aV"Is there a sense of wonder?"
p68
aVand "Does it invoke curiosity?"
p69
aa(lp70
VThis is a scientific diagram, by the way.
p71
aVI don't have time to explain it,
p72
aVbut it has to do with DNA and RNA.
p73
aVSo I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work.
p74
aVThe things that interest me when I'm working
p75
aVare visual structure,
p76
aVsurprise
p77
aVand anything that requires figuring things out.
p78
aVSo for this reason, I'm particularly drawn
p79
aVto systems and patterns.
p80
aVI'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works.
p81
aa(lp82
VThis is a piece that I did for
p83
aVThe Guardian newspaper in the U.K.
p84
aVThey have a magazine that they call G2.
p85
aVAnd this is for their puzzle special
p86
aVin 2007.
p87
aVAnd puzzling it is.
p88
aVI started by creating a series of tiling units.
p89
aVAnd these tiling units, I designed
p90
aVspecifically so that they would contain
p91
aVparts of letterforms within their shapes
p92
aVso that I could then
p93
aVjoin those pieces together
p94
aVto create letters and then words
p95
aVwithin the abstract patterning.
p96
aVBut then as well, I was able to
p97
aVjust flip them, rotate them
p98
aVand combine them in different ways
p99
aVto create either regular patterns
p100
aVor abstract patterns.
p101
aVSo here's the word puzzle again.
p102
aVAnd here it is with the abstract surrounding.
p103
aVAnd as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.
p104
aVBut all I have to do is
p105
aVfill certain areas of those letterforms
p106
aVand I can bring those words out of
p107
aVthe background pattern.
p108
aVBut maybe that's a little too obvious.
p109
aVSo then I can add some color in with the background
p110
aVand add a bit more color in with the words themselves,
p111
aVand this way, working with the art director,
p112
aVI'm able to bring it to just the right point
p113
aVthat it's puzzling for the audience \u2014
p114
aVthey can figure out that there's something they have to read \u2014
p115
aVbut it's not impossible for them to read.
p116
aa(lp117
VI'm also interested in working with
p118
aVunusual materials
p119
aVand common materials in unusual ways.
p120
aVSo this requires figuring out how to
p121
aVget the most out of something's innate properties
p122
aVand also how to bend it to my will.
p123
aVSo ultimately,
p124
aVmy goal is to create something unexpected.
p125
aVTo this end, I have worked in sugar
p126
aVfor Stefan Sagmeister,
p127
aVthree-time TED speaker.
p128
aVAnd this project began essentially
p129
aVon my kitchen table.
p130
aVI've been eating cereal for breakfast
p131
aVall of my life.
p132
aVAnd for that same amount of time,
p133
aVI've been spilling sugar on the table
p134
aVand just kind of playing with it with my fingers.
p135
aVAnd eventually I used this technique
p136
aVto create a piece of artwork.
p137
aVAnd then I used it again to create
p138
aVsix pieces for Stefan's book,
p139
aV"Things in My Life I've Learned So Far."
p140
aVAnd these were created
p141
aVwithout sketches, just freehand,
p142
aVby putting the sugar down on a white surface
p143
aVand then manipulating it to get
p144
aVthe words and designs out of it.
p145
aVRecently, I've also made some
p146
aVrather highbrow baroque borders
p147
aVout of lowbrow pasta.
p148
aVAnd this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book,
p149
aVand the chapter is on honor.
p150
aVSo it's a little bit unexpected,
p151
aVbut, in a way, it refers
p152
aVto the macaroni art
p153
aVthat children make for their parents
p154
aVor they make in school and give to their parents,
p155
aVwhich is in itself a form of honor.
p156
aVThis is what you can do with some household tinfoil.
p157
aVOkay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VI'm very interested in wonder,
p162
aVin design as an impetus to inquiring.
p163
aVTo say I wonder is to say
p164
aVI question, I ask.
p165
aVAnd to experience wonder is to experience awe.
p166
aVSo I'm currently working on a book,
p167
aVwhich plays with both senses of the word,
p168
aVas I explore some of my own ideas
p169
aVand inquiries
p170
aVin a visual display of rather
p171
aVpeacock-like grandeur.
p172
aVThe world is full of wonder.
p173
aVBut the world of graphic design,
p174
aVfor the most part, is not.
p175
aVSo I'm using my own writings
p176
aVas a kind of testing ground for a book that has
p177
aVan interdependency between word and image
p178
aVas a kind of seductive force.
p179
aVI think that one of the things
p180
aVthat religions got right
p181
aVwas the use of visual wonder
p182
aVto deliver a message.
p183
aVI think this true marriage of art and information
p184
aVis woefully underused in adult literature,
p185
aVand I'm mystified as to
p186
aVwhy visual wealth is not more commonly used
p187
aVto enhance intellectual wealth.
p188
aVWhen we look at works like this,
p189
aVwe tend to associate them with children's literature.
p190
aVThere's an implication that ornamental graphics
p191
aVdetract from the seriousness of the content.
p192
aVBut I really hope to have the opportunity
p193
aVto change that perception.
p194
aVThis book is taking rather a long time,
p195
aVbut I'm nearly done.
p196
aa(lp197
VFor some reason, I thought it would be a good idea
p198
aVto put an intermission
p199
aVin my talk.
p200
aVAnd this is it \u2014 just to give you and me a moment to catch up.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo I do these valentines.
p205
aVI've been sending out valentines
p206
aVon a fairly large scale since 2005.
p207
aVThese are my valentines
p208
aVfrom 2005 and 2006.
p209
aVAnd I started by
p210
aVdoing just a single image like this
p211
aVand sending them out to each person.
p212
aVBut in 2007,
p213
aVI got the cockamamie idea
p214
aVto hand-draw each valentine
p215
aVfor everyone on my mailing list.
p216
aVI reduced my mailing list to 150 people.
p217
aVAnd I drew each person
p218
aVtheir own unique valentine
p219
aVand put their name on it
p220
aVand numbered it and signed it and sent it out.
p221
aVBelieve it or not, I devised this
p222
aVas a timesaving method.
p223
aVI was very busy in the beginning of that year,
p224
aVand I didn't know when I was going to find time
p225
aVto design and print a single valentine.
p226
aVAnd I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal
p227
aVas I was traveling.
p228
aVIt didn't exactly work out that way.
p229
aVThere's a longer story to this,
p230
aVbut I did get them all done in time,
p231
aVand they were extremely well received.
p232
aVI got an almost 100 percent response rate.
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aVAnd those who didn't respond
p235
aVwill never receive anything from me ever again.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VLast year,
p240
aVI took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.
p241
aVI had this idea that I wanted people
p242
aVto receive a kind of
p243
aVmysterious love letter,
p244
aVlike a found fragment in their mailbox.
p245
aVI wanted it to be something
p246
aVthat was not addressed to them
p247
aVor signed by me,
p248
aVsomething that caused them to wonder
p249
aVwhat on Earth this thing was.
p250
aVAnd I specifically wrote
p251
aVfour pages that don't connect.
p252
aVThere were four different versions of this.
p253
aVAnd I wrote them
p254
aVso that they begin in the middle of a sentence,
p255
aVend in the middle of a sentence.
p256
aVAnd they're on the one hand, universal,
p257
aVso I avoid specific names or places,
p258
aVbut on the other hand, they're personal.
p259
aVSo I wanted people to really get the sense that
p260
aVthey had received something that could have been
p261
aVa love letter to them.
p262
aVAnd I'm just going to read one of them to you.
p263
aa(lp264
V"You've never really been sure of this,
p265
aVbut I can assure you that this quirk
p266
aVyou're so self-conscious of
p267
aVis intensely endearing.
p268
aVJust please accept that this piece of you
p269
aVescapes with your smile,
p270
aVand those of us who notice
p271
aVare happy to catch it in passing.
p272
aVTime spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds,
p273
aVbut without the scratches and bird shit."
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aV"That is to say,
p276
aVyour thoughts and words flit and dart,
p277
aVdisconcertedly elusive at times,
p278
aVbut when caught and examined \u2014
p279
aVahh, such a wonder,
p280
aVsuch a delightful reward.
p281
aVThere's no passing time with you,
p282
aVonly collecting \u2014
p283
aVthe collecting of moments with the hope for preservation
p284
aVand at the same time release.
p285
aVImpossible? I don't think so.
p286
aVI know this makes you embarrassed.
p287
aVI'm certain I can see you blushing.
p288
aVBut I just have to tell you because
p289
aVsometimes I hear your self-doubt,
p290
aVand it's so crushing to think
p291
aVthat you may not know how truly wonderful you are,
p292
aVhow inspiring and delightful
p293
aVand really, truly the most completely ..."
p294

p298
aa(lp299
VSo Valentine's Day
p300
aVis coming up in a couple of days,
p301
aVand these are currently arriving
p302
aVin mailboxes all around the world.
p303
aVThis year, I got, what I really have to say
p304
aVis a rather brilliant idea,
p305
aVto laser cut
p306
aVmy valentines
p307
aVout of used Christmas cards.
p308
aVSo I solicited friends
p309
aVto send me their used Christmas cards,
p310
aVand I made 500 of these.
p311
aVEach one of them is completely different.
p312
aVI'm just really, really thrilled with them.
p313
aVI don't have that much else to say,
p314
aVbut they turned out really well.
p315
aa(lp316
VI do spend a lot of time on my work.
p317
aVAnd one of the things that I've been thinking about recently
p318
aVis what is worth while.
p319
aVWhat is it that's worth spending my time on
p320
aVand my life on in this way?
p321
aVWorking in the commercial world,
p322
aVthis is something that I do have to struggle with at times.
p323
aVAnd yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money.
p324
aVBut ultimately, I don't consider that a worthy goal.
p325
aVWhat makes something worthwhile for me
p326
aVis the people I work for or with,
p327
aVthe conditions I work under
p328
aVand the audience that I'm able to reach.
p329
aVSo I might ask: "Who is it for?"
p330
aV"What does it say?"
p331
aVand "What does it do?"
p332
aa(lp333
VYou know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult
p334
aVfor someone like me to come up on stage
p335
aVat this conference
p336
aVwith these unbelievably brilliant minds,
p337
aVwho are thinking these
p338
aVreally big-picture,
p339
aVworld-changing, life-changing
p340
aVideas and technologies.
p341
aVAnd it's very, very common
p342
aVfor designers and people in the visual arts
p343
aVto feel that we're
p344
aVnot contributing enough,
p345
aVor worse, that all we're doing is
p346
aVcontributing to landfill.
p347
aVHere I am; I'm showing you
p348
aVsome pretty visuals
p349
aVand talking about aesthetics.
p350
aVBut I've come to believe that
p351
aVtruly imaginative visual work
p352
aVis extremely important in society.
p353
aa(lp354
VJust in the way that I'm inspired
p355
aVby books
p356
aVand magazines of all kinds,
p357
aVconversations I have, movies,
p358
aVso I also think,
p359
aVwhen I put visual work out there into the mass media,
p360
aVwork that is interesting, unusual,
p361
aVintriguing,
p362
aVwork that maybe opens up that sense
p363
aVof inquiry in the mind,
p364
aVthat I'm seeding the imagination of the populace.
p365
aVAnd you just never know who
p366
aVis going to take something from that
p367
aVand turn it into something else,
p368
aVbecause inspiration
p369
aVis cross-pollinating.
p370
aVSo a piece of mine
p371
aVmay inspire a playwright
p372
aVor a novelist or a scientist,
p373
aVand that in turn may be the seed
p374
aVthat inspires a doctor
p375
aVor a philanthropist
p376
aVor a babysitter.
p377
aVAnd this isn't something that you can quantify
p378
aVor track or measure,
p379
aVand we tend to undervalue things in society
p380
aVthat we can't measure.
p381
aa(lp382
VBut I really believe
p383
aVthat a fully operating, rich society
p384
aVneeds these seeds coming from all directions
p385
aVand all disciplines
p386
aVin order to keep the gears of inspiration
p387
aVand imagination
p388
aVflowing and cycling and growing.
p389
aVSo that's why I do what I do,
p390
aVand why I spend so much time and effort on it,
p391
aVand why I work in the commercial, public sphere,
p392
aVas opposed to the isolated, private sphere
p393
aVof fine art:
p394
aVbecause I want as many people as possible
p395
aVto see my work, notice it, be drawn into it,
p396
aVand be able to take something from it.
p397
aVAnd I actually really feel that it's worthwhile
p398
aVto spend my valuable
p399
aVand limited time on this Earth
p400
aVin this way.
p401
aVAnd I thank you for allowing me to show it to you.

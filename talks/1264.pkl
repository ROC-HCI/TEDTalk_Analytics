VSo historically there has
p5
aVbeen a huge divide between what people
p6
aVconsider to be non-living systems on one
p7
aVside, and living systems on the other side.
p8
aVSo we go from, say, this beautiful and
p9
aVcomplex crystal as non-life, and this rather
p10
aVbeautiful and complex cat on the other side.
p11
aVOver the last hundred and fifty years or so,
p12
aVscience has kind of blurred this distinction
p13
aVbetween non-living and living systems, and
p14
aVnow we consider that there may be a kind
p15
aVof continuum that exists between the two.
p16
aVWe'll just take one example here:
p17
aVa virus is a natural system, right?
p18
aVBut it's very simple. It's very simplistic.
p19
aVIt doesn't really satisfy all the requirements,
p20
aVit doesn't have all the characteristics
p21
aVof living systems and is in fact a parasite
p22
aVon other living systems in order to, say,
p23
aVreproduce and evolve.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut what we're going to be talking about here
p26
aVtonight are experiments done on this sort of
p27
aVnon-living end of this spectrum \u2014 so actually
p28
aVdoing chemical experiments in the laboratory,
p29
aVmixing together nonliving ingredients
p30
aVto make new structures, and that these
p31
aVnew structures might have some of the
p32
aVcharacteristics of living systems.
p33
aVReally what I'm talking about here is
p34
aVtrying to create a kind of artificial life.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo what are these characteristics that I'm
p37
aVtalking about? These are them.
p38
aVWe consider first that life has a body.
p39
aVNow this is necessary to distinguish the self
p40
aVfrom the environment.
p41
aVLife also has a metabolism. Now this is a
p42
aVprocess by which life can convert resources
p43
aVfrom the environment into building blocks
p44
aVso it can maintain and build itself.
p45
aVLife also has a kind of inheritable information.
p46
aVNow we, as humans, we store our information
p47
aVas DNA in our genomes and we pass this
p48
aVinformation on to our offspring.
p49
aVIf we couple the first two \u2014 the body and the metabolism \u2014
p50
aVwe can come up with a system that could
p51
aVperhaps move and replicate, and if we
p52
aVcoupled these now to inheritable information,
p53
aVwe can come up with a system that would be
p54
aVmore lifelike, and would perhaps evolve.
p55
aVAnd so these are the things we will try to do
p56
aVin the lab, make some experiments that have
p57
aVone or more of these characteristics of life.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo how do we do this? Well, we use
p60
aVa model system that we term a protocell.
p61
aVYou might think of this as kind of like a
p62
aVprimitive cell. It is a simple chemical
p63
aVmodel of a living cell, and if you consider
p64
aVfor example a cell in your body may have
p65
aVon the order of millions of different types
p66
aVof molecules that need to come together,
p67
aVplay together in a complex network
p68
aVto produce something that we call alive.
p69
aVIn the laboratory what we want to do
p70
aVis much the same, but with on the order of
p71
aVtens of different types of molecules \u2014
p72
aVso a drastic reduction in complexity, but still
p73
aVtrying to produce something that looks lifelike.
p74
aVAnd so what we do is, we start simple
p75
aVand we work our way up to living systems.
p76
aVConsider for a moment this quote by
p77
aVLeduc, a hundred years ago, considering a
p78
aVkind of synthetic biology:
p79
aV"The synthesis of life, should it ever occur,
p80
aVwill not be the sensational discovery which we
p81
aVusually associate with the idea."
p82
aVThat's his first statement. So if we actually
p83
aVcreate life in the laboratories, it's
p84
aVprobably not going to impact our lives at all.
p85
aa(lp86
V"If we accept the theory of evolution, then
p87
aVthe first dawn of synthesis of life must consist
p88
aVin the production of forms intermediate
p89
aVbetween the inorganic and the organic
p90
aVworld, or between the non-living
p91
aVand living world, forms which possess
p92
aVonly some of the rudimentary attributes of life"
p93
aV\u2014 so, the ones I just discussed \u2014
p94
aV"to which other attributes will be slowly added
p95
aVin the course of development by the
p96
aVevolutionary actions of the environment."
p97
aVSo we start simple, we make some structures
p98
aVthat may have some of these characteristics
p99
aVof life, and then we try to develop that
p100
aVto become more lifelike.
p101
aVThis is how we can start to make a protocell.
p102
aVWe use this idea called self-assembly.
p103
aVWhat that means is, I can mix some
p104
aVchemicals together in a test tube in my lab,
p105
aVand these chemicals will start to self-associate
p106
aVto form larger and larger structures.
p107
aVSo say on the order of tens of thousands,
p108
aVhundreds of thousands of molecules will
p109
aVcome together to form a large structure
p110
aVthat didn't exist before.
p111
aVAnd in this particular example,
p112
aVwhat I took is some membrane molecules,
p113
aVmixed those together in the right environment,
p114
aVand within seconds it forms these rather
p115
aVcomplex and beautiful structures here.
p116
aVThese membranes are also quite similar,
p117
aVmorphologically and functionally,
p118
aVto the membranes in your body,
p119
aVand we can use these, as they say,
p120
aVto form the body of our protocell.
p121
aa(lp122
VLikewise,
p123
aVwe can work with oil and water systems.
p124
aVAs you know, when you put oil and water together,
p125
aVthey don't mix, but through self-assembly
p126
aVwe can get a nice oil droplet to form,
p127
aVand we can actually use this as a body for
p128
aVour artificial organism or for our protocell,
p129
aVas you will see later.
p130
aVSo that's just forming some body stuff, right?
p131
aVSome architectures.
p132
aVWhat about the other aspects of living systems?
p133
aVSo we came up with this protocell model here
p134
aVthat I'm showing.
p135
aVWe started with a natural occurring clay
p136
aVcalled montmorillonite.
p137
aVThis is natural from the environment, this clay.
p138
aVIt forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.
p139
aVIt could run a metabolism on it.
p140
aVCertain kind of molecules like to associate
p141
aVwith the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red
p142
aV\u2014 this is a relative of DNA,
p143
aVit's an informational molecule \u2014
p144
aVit can come along and it starts to associate
p145
aVwith the surface of this clay.
p146
aVThis structure, then, can organize the
p147
aVformation of a membrane boundary around
p148
aVitself, so it can make a body of
p149
aVliquid molecules around itself, and that's
p150
aVshown in green here on this micrograph.
p151
aVSo just through self-assembly, mixing things
p152
aVtogether in the lab, we can come up with, say,
p153
aVa metabolic surface with some
p154
aVinformational molecules attached
p155
aVinside of this membrane body, right?
p156
aa(lp157
VSo we're on a road towards living systems.
p158
aVBut if you saw this protocell, you would not
p159
aVconfuse this with something that was actually alive.
p160
aVIt's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms,
p161
aVit doesn't really do anything.
p162
aVSo, something is missing.
p163
aVSome things are missing.
p164
aVSo some things that are missing is,
p165
aVfor example, if you had a flow of energy
p166
aVthrough a system, what we'd want
p167
aVis a protocell that can harvest
p168
aVsome of that energy in order to maintain itself,
p169
aVmuch like living systems do.
p170
aVSo we came up with a different protocell
p171
aVmodel, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.
p172
aVIn this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet,
p173
aVbut a chemical metabolism inside
p174
aVthat allows this protocell to use energy
p175
aVto do something, to actually become dynamic,
p176
aVas we'll see here.
p177
aVYou add the droplet to the system.
p178
aVIt's a pool of water, and the protocell
p179
aVstarts moving itself around in the system.
p180
aVOkay? Oil droplet forms
p181
aVthrough self-assembly, has a chemical
p182
aVmetabolism inside so it can use energy,
p183
aVand it uses that energy to move itself
p184
aVaround in its environment.
p185
aa(lp186
VAs we heard earlier, movement is very
p187
aVimportant in these kinds of living systems.
p188
aVIt is moving around, exploring its environment,
p189
aVand remodeling its environment, as you see,
p190
aVby these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.
p191
aVSo it's acting, in a sense, like a living system
p192
aVtrying to preserve itself.
p193
aVWe take this same moving protocell here,
p194
aVand we put it in another experiment,
p195
aVget it moving. Then I'm going
p196
aVto add some food to the system,
p197
aVand you'll see that in blue here, right?
p198
aVSo I add some food source to the system.
p199
aVThe protocell moves. It encounters the food.
p200
aVIt reconfigures itself and actually then
p201
aVis able to climb to the highest concentration
p202
aVof food in that system and stop there.
p203
aVAlright? So not only do we have this system
p204
aVthat has a body, it has a metabolism,
p205
aVit can use energy, it moves around.
p206
aVIt can sense its local environment
p207
aVand actually find resources
p208
aVin the environment to sustain itself.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have
p211
aVa neural system. This is just a sack of
p212
aVchemicals that is able to have this interesting
p213
aVand complex lifelike behavior.
p214
aVIf we count the number of chemicals
p215
aVin that system, actually, including the water
p216
aVthat's in the dish, we have five chemicals
p217
aVthat can do this.
p218
aVSo then we put these protocells together in a
p219
aVsingle experiment to see what they would do,
p220
aVand depending on the conditions, we have
p221
aVsome protocells on the left that are
p222
aVmoving around and it likes to touch the other
p223
aVstructures in its environment.
p224
aVOn the other hand we have two moving
p225
aVprotocells that like to circle each other,
p226
aVand they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other.
p227
aVRight? So not only do individual protocells
p228
aVhave behavior, what we've interpreted as
p229
aVbehavior in this system, but we also have
p230
aVbasically population-level behavior
p231
aVsimilar to what organisms have.
p232
aVSo now that you're all experts on protocells,
p233
aVwe're going to play a game with these protocells.
p234
aVWe're going to make two different kinds.
p235
aVProtocell A has a certain kind of chemistry
p236
aVinside that, when activated, the protocell
p237
aVstarts to vibrate around, just dancing.
p238
aVSo remember, these are primitive things,
p239
aVso dancing protocells, that's very
p240
aVinteresting to us. (Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VThe second protocell has a different
p243
aVchemistry inside, and when activated,
p244
aVthe protocells all come together and they fuse
p245
aVinto one big one. Right?
p246
aVAnd we just put these two together
p247
aVin the same system.
p248
aVSo there's population A,
p249
aVthere's population B, and then
p250
aVwe activate the system,
p251
aVand protocell Bs, they're the blue ones,
p252
aVthey all come together. They fuse together
p253
aVto form one big blob, and the other protocell
p254
aVjust dances around. And this just happens
p255
aVuntil all of the energy in the system is
p256
aVbasically used up, and then, game over.
p257
aVSo then I repeated this experiment
p258
aVa bunch of times, and one time
p259
aVsomething very interesting happened.
p260
aVSo, I added these protocells together
p261
aVto the system, and protocell A and protocell B
p262
aVfused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.
p263
aVThat didn't happen before. There it goes.
p264
aVThere's a protocell AB now in this system.
p265
aVProtocell AB likes to dance around for a bit,
p266
aVwhile protocell B does the fusing, okay?
p267
aa(lp268
VBut then something even more interesting happens.
p269
aVWatch when these two large protocells,
p270
aVthe hybrid ones, fuse together.
p271
aVNow we have a dancing protocell
p272
aVand a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter)
p273
aVJust with blobs of chemicals, again.
p274
aVSo the way this works is, you have
p275
aVa simple system of five chemicals here,
p276
aVa simple system here. When they hybridize,
p277
aVyou then form something that's different than
p278
aVbefore, it's more complex than before,
p279
aVand you get the emergence of another kind of
p280
aVlifelike behavior which
p281
aVin this case is replication.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo since we can make some interesting
p284
aVprotocells that we like, interesting colors and
p285
aVinteresting behaviors, and they're very easy
p286
aVto make, and they have interesting lifelike
p287
aVproperties, perhaps these protocells have
p288
aVsomething to tell us about the origin of life
p289
aVon the Earth. Perhaps these represent an
p290
aVeasily accessible step, one of the first steps
p291
aVby which life got started on the early Earth.
p292
aVCertainly, there were molecules present on
p293
aVthe early Earth, but they wouldn't have been
p294
aVthese pure compounds that we worked with
p295
aVin the lab and I showed in these experiments.
p296
aVRather, they'd be a real complex mixture of
p297
aVall kinds of stuff, because
p298
aVuncontrolled chemical reactions produce
p299
aVa diverse mixture of organic compounds.
p300
aVThink of it like a primordial ooze, okay?
p301
aVAnd it's a pool that's too difficult to fully
p302
aVcharacterize, even by modern methods, and
p303
aVthe product looks brown, like this tar here
p304
aVon the left. A pure compound
p305
aVis shown on the right, for contrast.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo this is similar to what happens when you
p308
aVtake pure sugar crystals in your kitchen,
p309
aVyou put them in a pan, and you apply energy.
p310
aVYou turn up the heat, you start making
p311
aVor breaking chemical bonds in the sugar,
p312
aVforming a brownish caramel, right?
p313
aVIf you let that go unregulated, you'll
p314
aVcontinue to make and break chemical bonds,
p315
aVforming an even more diverse mixture of
p316
aVmolecules that then forms this kind of black
p317
aVtarry stuff in your pan, right, that's
p318
aVdifficult to wash out. So that's what
p319
aVthe origin of life would have looked like.
p320
aVYou needed to get life out of this junk that
p321
aVis present on the early Earth,
p322
aVfour, 4.5 billion years ago.
p323
aVSo the challenge then is,
p324
aVthrow away all your pure chemicals in the lab,
p325
aVand try to make some protocells with lifelike
p326
aVproperties from this kind of primordial ooze.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo we're able to then see the self-assembly
p329
aVof these oil droplet bodies again
p330
aVthat we've seen previously,
p331
aVand the black spots inside of there
p332
aVrepresent this kind of black tar \u2014 this diverse,
p333
aVvery complex, organic black tar.
p334
aVAnd we put them into one of these
p335
aVexperiments, as you've seen earlier, and then
p336
aVwe watch lively movement that comes out.
p337
aVThey look really good, very nice movement,
p338
aVand also they appear to have some kind of
p339
aVbehavior where they kind of circle
p340
aVaround each other and follow each other,
p341
aVsimilar to what we've seen before \u2014 but again,
p342
aVworking with just primordial conditions,
p343
aVno pure chemicals.
p344
aVThese are also, these tar-fueled protocells,
p345
aVare also able to locate resources
p346
aVin their environment.
p347
aVI'm going to add some resource from the left,
p348
aVhere, that defuses into the system,
p349
aVand you can see, they really like that.
p350
aVThey become very energetic, and able
p351
aVto find the resource in the environment,
p352
aVsimilar to what we saw before.
p353
aVBut again, these are done in these primordial
p354
aVconditions, really messy conditions,
p355
aVnot sort of sterile laboratory conditions.
p356
aVThese are very dirty little protocells,
p357
aVas a matter of fact. (Laughter)
p358
aVBut they have lifelike properties, is the point.
p359
aa(lp360
VSo, doing these artificial life experiments
p361
aVhelps us define a potential path between
p362
aVnon-living and living systems.
p363
aVAnd not only that, but it helps us
p364
aVbroaden our view of what life is
p365
aVand what possible life there could be
p366
aVout there \u2014 life that could be very different
p367
aVfrom life that we find here on Earth.
p368
aVAnd that leads me to the next
p369
aVterm, which is "weird life."
p370
aVThis is a term by Steve Benner.
p371
aVThis is used in reference to a report
p372
aVin 2007 by the National Research Council
p373
aVin the United States, wherein
p374
aVthey tried to understand how we can
p375
aVlook for life elsewhere in the universe, okay,
p376
aVespecially if that life is very different from life
p377
aVon Earth. If we went to another planet and
p378
aVwe thought there might be life there,
p379
aVhow could we even recognize it as life?
p380
aa(lp381
VWell, they came up with three very general
p382
aVcriteria. First is \u2014 and they're listed here.
p383
aVThe first is, the system has to be in
p384
aVnon-equilibrium. That means the system
p385
aVcannot be dead, in a matter of fact.
p386
aVBasically what that means is, you have
p387
aVan input of energy into the system that life
p388
aVcan use and exploit to maintain itself.
p389
aVThis is similar to having the Sun shining
p390
aVon the Earth, driving photosynthesis,
p391
aVdriving the ecosystem.
p392
aVWithout the Sun, there's likely to be
p393
aVno life on this planet.
p394
aVSecondly, life needs to be in liquid form,
p395
aVso that means even if we had some
p396
aVinteresting structures, interesting molecules
p397
aVtogether but they were frozen solid,
p398
aVthen this is not a good place for life.
p399
aVAnd thirdly, we need to be able to make
p400
aVand break chemical bonds. And again
p401
aVthis is important because life transforms
p402
aVresources from the environment into
p403
aVbuilding blocks so it can maintain itself.
p404
aa(lp405
VNow today, I told you about very strange
p406
aVand weird protocells \u2014 some that contain clay,
p407
aVsome that have primordial ooze in them,
p408
aVsome that have basically oil
p409
aVinstead of water inside of them.
p410
aVMost of these don't contain DNA,
p411
aVbut yet they have lifelike properties.
p412
aVBut these protocells satisfy
p413
aVthese general requirements of living systems.
p414
aVSo by making these chemical, artificial
p415
aVlife experiments, we hope not only
p416
aVto understand something fundamental
p417
aVabout the origin of life and the existence
p418
aVof life on this planet, but also
p419
aVwhat possible life there could be
p420
aVout there in the universe. Thank you.

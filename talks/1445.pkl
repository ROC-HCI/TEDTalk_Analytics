p5

V(Swat)
p7
aa(lp8
VGotcha.
p9
aVMosquitoes.
p10
aVI hate them.
p11
aVDon't you?
p12
aVThat awful buzzing sound at night around your ears
p13
aVthat drives you absolutely crazy?
p14
aVKnowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin
p15
aVand suck out your blood?
p16
aVThat's awful, right?
p17
aVIn fact, there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes.
p18
aVWhen they fly into our bedroom at night,
p19
aVthey prefer to bite my wife.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VBut that's fascinating, right?
p24
aVWhy does she receive more bites than I do?
p25
aVAnd the answer is smell,
p26
aVthe smell of her body.
p27
aVAnd since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin
p28
aVthat either attract or repel mosquitoes,
p29
aVsome of us are just more attractive than others.
p30
aVSo my wife smells nicer than I do, or I just stink more than she does.
p31
aa(lp32
VEither way, mosquitoes find us in the dark by sniffing us out. They smell us.
p33
aVAnd during my PhD, I wanted to know exactly
p34
aVwhat chemicals from our skin African malaria mosquitoes use
p35
aVto track us down at night.
p36
aVAnd there's a whole range of compounds that they do use.
p37
aVAnd this was not going to be an easy task.
p38
aVAnd therefore we set up various experiments.
p39
aVWhy did we set up these experiments?
p40
aVBecause half the world's population
p41
aVruns the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria
p42
aVthrough a simple mosquito bite.
p43
aVEvery 30 seconds, somewhere on this planet,
p44
aVa child dies of malaria,
p45
aVand Paul Levy this morning, he was talking about the metaphor
p46
aVof the 727 crashing into the United States.
p47
aVWell, in Africa, we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s
p48
aVcrashing every day.
p49
aVBut perhaps if we can attract these mosquitoes to traps,
p50
aVbait it with our smell,
p51
aVwe may be able to stop transmission of disease.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, solving this puzzle was not an easy thing,
p54
aVbecause we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin,
p55
aVbut we undertook some remarkable experiments
p56
aVthat managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed.
p57
aa(lp58
VFirst, we observed that not all mosquito species
p59
aVbite on the same part of the body.
p60
aVStrange.
p61
aVSo we set up an experiment
p62
aVwhere we put a naked volunteer in a large cage,
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
Vand in that cage, we released mosquitoes
p67
aVto see where they were biting on the body of that person.
p68
aVAnd we found some remarkable differences.
p69
aVOn the left here you see the bites
p70
aVby the Dutch malaria mosquito on this person.
p71
aVThey had a very strong preference for biting on the face.
p72
aVIn contrast, the African malaria mosquito
p73
aVhad a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person.
p74
aVAnd that, of course, we should have known all along,
p75
aVbecause they're called mosqui-toes, you see?
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VThat's right.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd so we started focusing on the smell of feet ...
p84
aVon the smell of human feet,
p85
aVuntil we came across a remarkable statement in the literature
p86
aVthat said that cheese smells after feet
p87
aVrather than the reverse.
p88
aVThink of it.
p89
aVAnd this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment.
p90
aVWe tried, with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese,
p91
aVwhich smells badly after feet,
p92
aVto attract African malaria mosquitoes.
p93
aVAnd you know what? It worked.
p94
aVIn fact, it worked so well
p95
aVthat now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese
p96
aVthat we're using in Tanzania
p97
aVand has been shown there
p98
aVto be two to three times more attractive to mosquitoes than humans.
p99
aVLimburg, be proud of your cheese,
p100
aVas it is now used in the fight against malaria.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VThat's the cheese, just to show you.
p105
aa(lp106
VMy second story is remarkable as well.
p107
aVIt's about man's best friend. It's about dogs.
p108
aVAnd I will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria.
p109
aVOne of the best ways of killing mosquitoes
p110
aVis not to wait until they fly around like adults
p111
aVand bite people and transmit disease.
p112
aVIt's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae.
p113
aVWhy?
p114
aVBecause they are just like the CIA.
p115
aVIn that pool of water, these larvae are concentrated.
p116
aVThey're all together there. They are immobile.
p117
aVThey can't escape from that water.
p118
aVThey can't fly.
p119
aVAnd they're accessible.
p120
aVYou can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there, right?
p121
aa(lp122
VSo the problem that we face with this
p123
aVis that, throughout the landscape, all these pools of water with the larvae,
p124
aVthey are scattered all over the place,
p125
aVwhich makes it very hard for an inspector like this
p126
aVto actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides.
p127
aVAnd last year we thought very, very hard, how can we resolve this problem?
p128
aVUntil we realized that just like us \u2014 we have a unique smell \u2014
p129
aVmosquito larvae also have a very unique smell.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd so we set up another crazy experiment,
p132
aVbecause we collected the smell of these larvae,
p133
aVput it on pieces of cloth, and then did something very remarkable.
p134
aVHere we have a bar with four holes
p135
aVand we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole.
p136
aVOh, that was very quick.
p137
aVAnd then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie.
p138
aVHe's examining these holes and now he's got it already.
p139
aVHe's going back to check the control holes again,
p140
aVbut he's coming back to the first one,
p141
aVand now he's locking into that smell,
p142
aVwhich means that now, we can use dogs with these inspectors
p143
aVto much better find the breeding sites of mosquitoes in the field,
p144
aVand therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria.
p145
aVThis lady is Ellen van der Zweep.
p146
aVShe's one of the best dog trainers in the world,
p147
aVand she believes that we can do a lot more.
p148
aVSince we also know that people that carry malaria parasites
p149
aVsmell different compared to people that are uninfected,
p150
aVshe's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite.
p151
aVThat means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way
p152
aVand there's few people remaining with parasites,
p153
aVthat the dogs can find these people,
p154
aVwe can treat them with antimalarial drugs and give the final blow to malaria.
p155
aVMan's best friend in the fight against malaria.
p156
aa(lp157
VMy third story is perhaps even more remarkable ...
p158
aVand, I should say, has never been shown to the public until today.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Audience cheers)
p161
aa(lp162
VYeah.
p163
aVIt's a crazy story, but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge
p164
aVagainst mosquitoes ever.
p165
aVIn fact, people have told me
p166
aVthat now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes.
p167
aVAnd the question of course is,
p168
aVwhat would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes?
p169
aVAnd the answer I have right here ...
p170
aVin my pocket \u2014
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
Vif I get it.
p175
aVIt's a tablet.
p176
aVA simple tablet,
p177
aVand when I take it with water ...
p178
aVit does miracles.
p179
aVThank you.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, let me show you how this works.
p182
aVHere in this box, I have a cage
p183
aVwith several hundred hungry female mosquitoes ...
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
Vthat I'm just about to release.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VJust kidding, just kidding.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VWhat I'm going to show you is, I'm gonna stick my arm into it
p196
aVand I will show you how quickly they will bite.
p197
aVThere we go.
p198
aVDon't worry, I do this all the time in the lab.
p199
aVThere we go.
p200
aVOK.
p201
aVNow, on the video \u2014
p202
aVon the video here,
p203
aVI'm going to show you exactly the same thing,
p204
aVexcept that what I'm showing you on the video
p205
aVhappened one hour after I took the tablet.
p206
aVHave a look.
p207
aVThat doesn't work.
p208
aVOK. Sorry about that.
p209
aVI'm sticking in my arm, I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal,
p210
aVI'm shaking them off, and we follow them through time
p211
aVto see these mosquitoes get very, very sick indeed,
p212
aVhere shown in fast motion.
p213
aVAnd three hours later, what we see at the bottom of the cage
p214
aVis dead mosquitoes ...
p215
aVvery dead mosquitoes.
p216
aVAnd I'm going to say, ladies and gentlemen,
p217
aVwe have swapped the cards with mosquitoes.
p218
aVThey don't kill us. We kill them.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VNow \u2014
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aVMaastricht, be prepared.
p226
aVNow, think of what we can do with this.
p227
aVWe can actually use this to contain outbreaks
p228
aVof mosquito-born diseases, of epidemics, right?
p229
aVAnd better still, imagine what would happen
p230
aVif, in a very large area, everyone would take these drugs, for just three weeks.
p231
aVThat would give us an opportunity
p232
aVto actually eliminate malaria as a disease.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo cheese, dogs and a pill to kill mosquitoes.
p235
aVThat's the kind of out-of-the-box science that I love doing ...
p236
aVfor the betterment of mankind,
p237
aVbut especially for her,
p238
aVso that she can grow up in a world without malaria.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you.

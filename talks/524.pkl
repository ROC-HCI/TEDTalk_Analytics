VI'm going to read a few strips.
p5
aVThese are, most of these are
p6
aVfrom a monthly page I do
p7
aVin and architecture and design magazine
p8
aVcalled Metropolis.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd the first story is called
p11
aV"The Faulty Switch."
p12
aa(lp13
VAnother beautifully designed new building
p14
aVruined by the sound of a common wall light switch.
p15
aVIt's fine during the day
p16
aVwhen the main rooms are flooded with sunlight.
p17
aVBut at dusk
p18
aVeverything changes.
p19
aa(lp20
VThe architect spent hundreds of hours
p21
aVdesigning the burnished brass switchplates
p22
aVfor his new office tower.
p23
aVAnd then left it to a contractor
p24
aVto install these 79-cent switches behind them.
p25
aa(lp26
VWe know instinctively where to reach
p27
aVwhen we enter a dark room.
p28
aVWe automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward.
p29
aVBut the sound we are greeted with,
p30
aVas the room is bathed in the simulated glow
p31
aVof late-afternoon light,
p32
aVrecalls to mind
p33
aVa dirty men's room
p34
aVin the rear of a Greek coffee shop.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VThis sound colors our first impression of any room;
p38
aVit can't be helped.
p39
aVBut where does this sound,
p40
aVcommonly described as a click, come from?
p41
aVIs it simply the byproduct of a
p42
aVcrude mechanical action?
p43
aVOr is it an imitation
p44
aVof one half the set of sounds we make
p45
aVto express disappointment?
p46
aVThe often dental consonant
p47
aVof no Indo-European language.
p48
aa(lp49
VOr is it the amplified sound
p50
aVof a synapse firing
p51
aVin the brain of a cockroach?
p52
aVIn the 1950s they tried their best
p53
aVto muffle this sound
p54
aVwith mercury switches
p55
aVand silent knob controls.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut today these improvements
p58
aVseem somehow inauthentic.
p59
aVThe click is the modern
p60
aVtriumphal clarion
p61
aVproceeding us through life,
p62
aVannouncing our entry into every lightless room.
p63
aa(lp64
VThe sound made flicking a wall switch off
p65
aVis of a completely different nature.
p66
aVIt has a deep melancholy ring.
p67
aVChildren don't like it.
p68
aVIt's why they leave lights on around the house. (Laughter)
p69
aVAdults find it comforting.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut wouldn't it be an easy matter
p72
aVto wire a wall switch
p73
aVso that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship?
p74
aVOr the recorded crowing of a rooster?
p75
aVOr the distant peel of thunder?
p76
aa(lp77
VThomas Edison went through
p78
aVthousands of unlikely substances
p79
aVbefore he came upon the right one
p80
aVfor the filament of his electric light bulb.
p81
aVWhy have we settled so quickly
p82
aVfor the sound of its switch?
p83
aVThat's the end of that.
p84
aV(Applause)
p85
aa(lp86
VThe next story is called
p87
aV"In Praise of the Taxpayer."
p88
aa(lp89
VThat so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers
p90
aVhave survived yet another commercial building boom,
p91
aVis cause for celebration.
p92
aa(lp93
VThese one or two story structures,
p94
aVdesigned to yield only enough income
p95
aVto cover the taxes on the land
p96
aVon which they stand,
p97
aVwere not meant to be permanent buildings.
p98
aVYet for one reason or another
p99
aVthey have confounded the efforts of developers
p100
aVto be combined into lots
p101
aVsuitable for high-rise construction.
p102
aa(lp103
VAlthough they make no claim to architectural beauty,
p104
aVthey are, in their perfect temporariness,
p105
aVa delightful alternative
p106
aVto the large-scale structures
p107
aVthat might someday take their place.
p108
aVThe most perfect examples
p109
aVoccupy corner lots.
p110
aVThey offer a pleasant respite
p111
aVfrom the high-density development around them.
p112
aVA break of light and air,
p113
aVan architectural biding of time.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo buried in signage
p116
aVare these structures,
p117
aVthat it often takes a moment
p118
aVto distinguish the modern
p119
aVspecially constructed taxpayer
p120
aVfrom its neighbor:
p121
aVthe small commercial building
p122
aVfrom an earlier century,
p123
aVwhose upper floors have been sealed,
p124
aVand whose groundfloor space
p125
aVnow functions as a taxpayer.
p126
aVThe few surfaces not covered by signs
p127
aVare often clad in a distinctive, dark
p128
aVgreen-gray, striated aluminum siding.
p129
aVTake-out sandwich shops,
p130
aVfilm processing drop-offs,
p131
aVpeep-shows and necktie stores.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow these provisional structures have,
p134
aVin some cases,
p135
aVremained standing
p136
aVfor the better part of a human lifetime.
p137
aVThe temporary building
p138
aVis a triumph of modern industrial organization,
p139
aVa healthy sublimation
p140
aVof the urge to build,
p141
aVand proof that not every
p142
aVarchitectural idea
p143
aVneed be set in stone.
p144
aVThat's the end.
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd the next story is called, "On the Human Lap."
p148
aVFor the ancient Egyptians
p149
aVthe lap was a platform
p150
aVupon which to place
p151
aVthe earthly possessions of the dead \u2014
p152
aV30 cubits from foot to knee.
p153
aa(lp154
VIt was not until the 14th century
p155
aVthat an Italian painter
p156
aVrecognized the lap
p157
aVas a Grecian temple,
p158
aVupholstered in flesh and cloth.
p159
aVOver the next 200 years
p160
aVwe see the infant Christ
p161
aVgo from a sitting to a standing position
p162
aVon the Virgin's lap,
p163
aVand then back again.
p164
aVEvery child recapitulates this ascension,
p165
aVstraddling one or both legs,
p166
aVsitting sideways,
p167
aVor leaning against the body.
p168
aa(lp169
VFrom there, to the modern ventriloquist's dummy,
p170
aVis but a brief moment in history.
p171
aVYou were late for school again this morning.
p172
aVThe ventriloquist must first make us believe
p173
aVthat a small boy is sitting on his lap.
p174
aVThe illusion of speech follows incidentally.
p175
aVWhat have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy?
p176
aa(lp177
VAs adults we admire the lap
p178
aVfrom a nostalgic distance.
p179
aVWe have fading memories
p180
aVof that provisional temple,
p181
aVerected each time an adult sat down.
p182
aVOn a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on.
p183
aVIt is children and teenage girls
p184
aVwho are most keenly aware
p185
aVof its architectural beauty.
p186
aVThey understand the structural integrity
p187
aVof a deep avuncular lap,
p188
aVas compared to the shaky arrangement
p189
aVof a neurotic niece in high heels.
p190
aa(lp191
VThe relationship between the lap and its owner
p192
aVis direct and intimate.
p193
aVI envision a 36-story,
p194
aV450-unit residential high-rise \u2014
p195
aVa reason to consider the mental health
p196
aVof any architect before granting
p197
aVan important commission.
p198
aVThe bathrooms and kitchens will,
p199
aVof course, have no windows.
p200
aVThe lap of luxury
p201
aVis an architectural construct of childhood,
p202
aVwhich we seek, in vain,
p203
aVas adults, to employ.
p204
aVThat's the end.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VThe next story is called "The Haverpiece Collection"
p208
aVA nondescript warehouse,
p209
aVvisible for a moment
p210
aVfrom the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway,
p211
aVserves as the temporary resting place
p212
aVfor the Haverpiece collection
p213
aVof European dried fruit.
p214
aa(lp215
VThe profound convolutions
p216
aVon the surface of a dried cherry.
p217
aVThe foreboding sheen of an extra-large date.
p218
aa(lp219
VDo you remember wandering as a child
p220
aVthrough those dark wooden
p221
aVstorefront galleries?
p222
aVWhere everything was displayed
p223
aVin poorly labeled roach-proof bins.
p224
aa(lp225
VPears dried in the form
p226
aVof genital organs.
p227
aVApricot halves
p228
aVlike the ears of cherubim.
p229
aa(lp230
VIn 1962 the unsold stock
p231
aVwas purchased by Maurice Haverpiece,
p232
aVa wealthy prune juice bottler,
p233
aVand consolidated to form the core collection.
p234
aVAs an art form it lies somewhere between
p235
aVstill-life painting and plumbing.
p236
aa(lp237
VUpon his death in 1967,
p238
aVa quarter of the items were sold off for compote
p239
aVto a high-class hotel restaurant.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVUnsuspecting guests were served
p242
aVstewed turn-of-the-century
p243
aVTurkish figs for breakfast.
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VThe rest of the collection remains here,
p247
aVstored in plain brown paper bags
p248
aVuntil funds can be raised
p249
aVto build a permanent museum
p250
aVand study center.
p251
aa(lp252
VA shoe made of apricot leather

aVfor the daughter of a czar.
p254
aa(lp255

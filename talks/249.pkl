VIt is interesting that in the United States,
p5
aVthe most significant health-care budget
p6
aVgoes to cardiovascular disease care, whether it's private or public.
p7
aVThere's no comparison at all.
p8
aVIn Africa \u2014 where it is a major killer \u2014 it is totally ignored.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it.
p11
aVA health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.
p12
aV17 million people die every year from heart disease.
p13
aV32 million heart attacks and strokes occur.
p14
aVMost of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa.
p15
aV85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease
p16
aVis in developing countries \u2014 not in the West \u2014
p17
aVand yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West.
p18
aa(lp19
VWho is at risk? People like you.
p20
aVIt's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that.
p21
aVAll friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time,
p22
aVshould be very concerned about this deplorable situation.
p23
aVHas anyone here wondered what will happen
p24
aVif you go back to your room at night,
p25
aVand you start getting chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating?
p26
aVYou're having a heart attack. What are you going to do?
p27
aVWill you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe?
p28
aVNo, you will die. 50 percent will die within 24 hours, if not treated.
p29
aa(lp30
VThis is what's going on.
p31
aVIn a look at the map of the U.S. \u2014 the graph here,
p32
aV10 million people here, 10 million here.
p33
aVBy the time you get to 50, it's almost no one left in Nigeria \u2014
p34
aVlife expectancy is 47.
p35
aVIt's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses \u2014
p36
aVthey do \u2014 but they do not survive after the time that they reach
p37
aVabout 45 years old and 50 years old.
p38
aVAnd those are the times they're most productive.
p39
aVThose are the times that they should be contributing
p40
aVto Africa's development. But they're not there.
p41
aVThe best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents.
p42
aVIf you cannot secure the parents,
p43
aVyou cannot guarantee the security of the African child.
p44
aa(lp45
VWhat are the risk factors?
p46
aVIt's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those.
p47
aVThese are just for information:
p48
aVhypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects.
p49
aVRight here in Tanzania, 30 percent of individuals have hypertension.
p50
aV20 percent are getting treated.
p51
aVOnly less than one percent are adequately treated.
p52
aVIf we can treat hypertension alone in Africa,
p53
aVwe'll save 250,000 lives a year. That's quite significant!
p54
aa(lp55
VEasy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius.
p56
aVIn eight short years \u2014 we're here talking about HIV, malaria,
p57
aVwhich is all good.
p58
aVWe cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV.
p59
aVIn eight short years, non-communicable diseases
p60
aVwill become the leading causes of death in Africa.
p61
aa(lp62
VThat is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this.
p63
aVThis is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites \u2014
p64
aVthey go to USA, Germany, U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable.
p65
aVYou can't depend on foreign aid alone.
p66
aVHere is the situation: countries are turning inwards.
p67
aVPost-9/11, [the] United States has had a lot of trouble
p68
aVto deal with, their own internal issues.
p69
aVSo, they spend their money trying to fix those problems.
p70
aVYou can't rightly \u2014 it's not their responsibility,
p71
aVit is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems.
p72
aVIf they help, that's good! But that is not my expectation.
p73
aVThese worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa
p74
aVdemand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things
p75
aVthe way we've always done them.
p76
aVIf they have not worked, we have to look for alternative solutions.
p77
aa(lp78
VI'm here to talk to you about solutions.
p79
aVThis has been \u2014 what has been a difficult sign to some of us.
p80
aVSeveral years ago, we started thinking about it.
p81
aVEveryone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are.
p82
aVWe decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is.
p83
aVEveryone is ready to throw in money,
p84
aVin terms of free money aid to developing countries.
p85
aVTalk about sustainable investment, no one is interested.
p86
aVYou can't raise money.
p87
aVI have done businesses in healthcare in the United States \u2014
p88
aVI live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America.
p89
aV[It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures.
p90
aVBut start telling them, you know,
p91
aVwe're going to try to do it in Nigeria \u2014 everyone runs away.
p92
aVThat is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here,
p93
aVif you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development.
p94
aa(lp95
VLet me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute,
p96
aVso you get a glimpse of what we do,
p97
aVand I'll talk a little bit more about it.
p98
aVWhat we have done is to show that high-quality health care,
p99
aVcomparable to the best anywhere in the world,
p100
aVcan be done in a developing country environment.
p101
aVWe have 25 positions right now \u2014 all of them trained,
p102
aVboard certified in the USA, Canada or Britain.
p103
aVWe have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt,
p104
aVCleveland Clinic \u2014 everywhere in the U.S. \u2014
p105
aVand we do it for about 10 percent of the cost
p106
aVthat you will need to do those things in the United States.
p107
aV(Applause)
p108
aa(lp109
VAdditionally, we have a policy
p110
aVthat no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay.
p111
aVWe take care of everyone.
p112
aV(Applause)
p113
aVWhether you have one dollar, two dollars \u2014 it doesn't matter.
p114
aVAnd I will tell you how we're able to do it.
p115
aa(lp116
VWe make sure that we select our equipment properly.
p117
aVWe go for modular units. Units that have multi-modality functions
p118
aVhave modular components. Easy to repair, and because of that,
p119
aVwe do not take things that are not durable and cannot last.
p120
aVWe emphasize training,
p121
aVand we make sure that this process is regenerative.
p122
aVVery soon we will all be dead and gone, but the problems will stay,
p123
aVunless we have people taking over from where we stopped.
p124
aa(lp125
VWe made sure that we produced some things ourselves.
p126
aVWe do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals.
p127
aVWe get the generators from the companies.
p128
aVWe manufacture them in-house, ourselves. That keeps the costs down.
p129
aVSo, for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S. \u2014
p130
aVthat you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars \u2014
p131
aVwhen we're finished manufacturing it in-house,
p132
aVwe come at a price of about two dollars.
p133
aV(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VWe recognize that the only way to bridge the gap
p136
aVbetween the rich and poor countries
p137
aVis through education and technology.
p138
aVAll these problems we're talking about \u2014
p139
aVif we bring development, they will all disappear.
p140
aVTechnology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work?
p141
aVIt's been proved: self-care is cost-effective.
p142
aVIt extends opportunity to the rural centers,
p143
aVand we can use expertise in a very smart way.
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is the way our centers are set up.
p146
aVWe currently have three locations in the Caribbean,
p147
aVand we're planning a fourth one.
p148
aVAnd we have now decided to go into Africa.
p149
aVWe will be doing the West African Heart Institute
p150
aVin Port Harcourt, Nigeria. That project will be starting
p151
aVwithin the next few months. We hope to open in 2008-09.
p152
aVAnd we will do other centers.
p153
aVThis model can be adapted to every disease process.
p154
aVAll the units, all the centers, are linked
p155
aVthrough a switched hub to a central server,
p156
aVand all the images are populated to review stations.
p157
aVAnd we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us,
p158
aVand we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone
p159
aVwho is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable.
p160
aa(lp161
VWe make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access
p162
aVto expert medical specialists anywhere in the world,
p163
aVjust by a click of the button.
p164
aVI'll lead you through, to see how this happens.
p165
aVThis is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in.
p166
aVI can call you in Switzerland and say, "Listen, go into our system.
p167
aVLook at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study, tell me what you think."
p168
aVThey'll give me that information,
p169
aVand we'll make the care of the patient better.
p170
aVThe patient doesn't have to travel.
p171
aVHe doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing
p172
aVbecause of limited expertise.
p173
aa(lp174
VWe also use [an] electronic medical record system.
p175
aVI'm happy to say that the things we have implemented \u2014
p176
aV80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them, and yet the technology is there.
p177
aVBut you know, they have that luxury.
p178
aVBecause if you can't get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham,
p179
aVtwo hours away, and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland,
p180
aVyou can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury,
p181
aVso we have to make it happen.
p182
aVWhen we do it, we will put the cost of care down.
p183
aVAnd we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable.
p184
aVAnd everyone will get the care they deserve.
p185
aa(lp186
VIt cannot just be technology, we recognize that.
p187
aVPrevention must be part of the solution \u2014 we emphasize that.
p188
aVBut, you know, you have to tell people what can be done.
p189
aVIt's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive,
p190
aVand they go home and can't do it.
p191
aVThey need to be alive, they need to feed.
p192
aVWe recommend exercise as the most effective, simple, easy thing to do.
p193
aVWe have had walks every year \u2014 every March, April.
p194
aVWe form people into groups and make them go into challenges.
p195
aVWhich group loses the most weight, we give them prizes.
p196
aVWhich groups record more walking distance by pedometer,
p197
aVwe give them prizes. We do this constantly.
p198
aVWe encourage them to bring children.
p199
aVThat way we start exposing the children from very early on,
p200
aVon what these issues are. Because once they learn it,
p201
aa(lp202
Vthey will stay with it. In doing this we have created
p203
aVat least 100 skilled jobs in Jamaica alone,
p204
aVand these are physicians with expertise and special training.
p205
aVWe have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died,
p206
aVincluding four free pacemakers in patients
p207
aVwith complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology,
p208
aVcomplete heart block means certain death.
p209
aVIf you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead.
p210
aVSo we are pleased with that.
p211
aa(lp212
VIndirectly, we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars
p213
aVfrom people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care.
p214
aVAnd we've hopefully saved a lot of lives.
p215
aVBy the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars
p216
aVin indigent care. In the first four months, it's been 340,000 dollars,
p217
aVaveraging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that,
p218
aVbecause they have competing needs.
p219
aVThey need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it.
p220
aVPeople say, "How can you do that?" This is how we can do that.
p221
aVAt least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment
p222
aVhave self-confessed that they did not go to Miami
p223
aVbecause of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean.
p224
aVAnd, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more \u2014
p225
aVeight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home,
p226
aVgetting the same quality of care.
p227
aVAnd for that money \u2014 for every one patient that has the money to pay,
p228
aVit gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people
p229
aVthat do not have the resources to pay.
p230
aV(Applause)
p231
aa(lp232
VFor this to work, this progress must be sustainable.
p233
aVSo, we emphasize training. Training is critical.
p234
aVWe have gone further: we have formed a relationship
p235
aVwith the University of Technology, Jamaica,
p236
aVwhere I now have an appointment.
p237
aVAnd we are starting a biomedical engineering program,
p238
aVso that we will train people locally, who can repair that equipment.
p239
aVThat way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues.
p240
aVWe're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs \u2014
p241
aVtraining people in echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound,
p242
aVthose kinds of things. Now, with that kind of training,
p243
aVit gives people motivation.
p244
aVBecause now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging
p245
aVand all that kind of stuff. In the process, I want you to just hear
p246
aVfrom the trainees themselves what it has meant for them.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Video) Dr. Jason Topping: My name is Jason Topping.
p249
aVI'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care
p250
aVat the University Hospital of the West Indies.
p251
aVI came to the Heart Institute in 2006,
p252
aVas part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program.
p253
aVI spent three months at the Heart Institute.
p254
aVThere's been no doubt around my colleagues
p255
aVabout the utility of the training I received here,
p256
aVand I think there's been an increased interest now in \u2014
p257
aVparticularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting.
p258
aa(lp259
VSharon Lazarus: I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean,
p260
aVsince the past two years. I received training at this institution.
p261
aVI think this aspect of training in cardiology
p262
aVthat the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica
p263
aVis very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases.
p264
aa(lp265
VErnest Madu: The lesson in this is that it can be done, and it can be sustained,
p266
aVand you can make it possible for everyone.
p267
aVWho are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care?
p268
aVWhen have you been appointed to play God?
p269
aVIt is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person,
p270
aVno matter what fate has assigned to you, will have the opportunity
p271
aVto get the best quality health care in life.
p272
aVNext stop is West African Heart Institute,
p273
aVthat we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt, Nigeria,
p274
aVas I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa.
p275
aVWe will extend the same system into other areas,
p276
aVlike dialysis treatment.
p277
aVAnd anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation,
p278
aVwe will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it,
p279
aa(lp280
Vand how you can do it. If we do this,
p281
aVwe can change the face of health care in Africa.
p282
aVAfrica has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to Africa.
p283
aVI am going. Those who want to come,
p284
aVI welcome you to come along with me.
p285
aVThank you.

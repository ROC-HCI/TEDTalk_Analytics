VI grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek.
p5
aVStar Trek made me want to see alien creatures,
p6
aVcreatures from a far-distant world.
p7
aVBut basically, I figured out that I could find
p8
aVthose alien creatures right on Earth.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd what I do is I study insects.
p11
aVI'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight.
p12
aVI think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps
p13
aVone of the most important events in the history of life.
p14
aVWithout insects, there'd be no flowering plants.
p15
aVWithout flowering plants, there would be no
p16
aVclever, fruit-eating primates giving TED Talks.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VNow,
p21
aVDavid and Hidehiko and Ketaki
p22
aVgave a very compelling story about
p23
aVthe similarities between fruit flies and humans,
p24
aVand there are many similarities,
p25
aVand so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies,
p26
aVthe favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this, for example \u2014
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVbut in my talk, I don't want to emphasize on the similarities
p29
aVbetween humans and fruit flies, but rather the differences,
p30
aVand focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence
p33
aVof a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting,
p34
aVand to the right, off-screen, is an electronic looming predator
p35
aVthat is going to go at the fly.
p36
aVThe fly is going to sense this predator.
p37
aVIt is going to extend its legs out.
p38
aVIt's going to sashay away
p39
aVto live to fly another day.
p40
aVNow I have carefully cropped this sequence
p41
aVto be exactly the duration of a human eye blink,
p42
aVso in the time that it would take you to blink your eye,
p43
aVthe fly has seen this looming predator,
p44
aVestimated its position, initiated a motor pattern to fly it away,
p45
aVbeating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so.
p46
aVI think this is a fascinating behavior
p47
aVthat shows how fast the fly's brain can process information.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, flight \u2014 what does it take to fly?
p50
aVWell, in order to fly, just as in a human aircraft,
p51
aVyou need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces,
p52
aVyou need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight,
p53
aVand you need a controller,
p54
aVand in the first human aircraft, the controller was basically
p55
aVthe brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow, how does this compare to a fly?
p58
aVWell, I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out
p59
aVhow insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air.
p60
aVAnd you might have heard how engineers proved
p61
aVthat bumblebees couldn't fly.
p62
aVWell, the problem was in thinking that the insect wings
p63
aVfunction in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't.
p64
aVAnd we tackle this problem by building giant,
p65
aVdynamically scaled model robot insects
p66
aVthat would flap in giant pools of mineral oil
p67
aVwhere we could study the aerodynamic forces.
p68
aVAnd it turns out that the insects flap their wings
p69
aVin a very clever way, at a very high angle of attack
p70
aVthat creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing,
p71
aVa little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex,
p72
aVand it's that vortex that actually enables the wings
p73
aVto make enough force for the animal to stay in the air.
p74
aVBut the thing that's actually most \u2014 so, what's fascinating
p75
aVis not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology.
p76
aVWhat's clever is the way the fly flaps it,
p77
aVwhich of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system,
p78
aVand this is what enables flies to perform
p79
aVthese remarkable aerial maneuvers.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, what about the engine?
p82
aVThe engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.
p83
aVThey have two types of flight muscle:
p84
aVso-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated,
p85
aVwhich means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled
p86
aVon a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.
p87
aVIt's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight,
p88
aVand it fills the middle portion of the fly,
p89
aVso when a fly hits your windshield,
p90
aVit's basically the power muscle that you're looking at.
p91
aVBut attached to the base of the wing
p92
aVis a set of little, tiny control muscles
p93
aVthat are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast,
p94
aVand they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing
p95
aVon a stroke-by-stroke basis,
p96
aVand this is what enables the fly to change its wing
p97
aVand generate the changes in aerodynamic forces
p98
aVwhich change its flight trajectory.
p99
aVAnd of course, the role of the nervous system is to control all this.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo let's look at the controller.
p102
aVNow flies excel in the sorts of sensors
p103
aVthat they carry to this problem.
p104
aVThey have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection.
p105
aVThey have a sophisticated eye which is
p106
aVthe fastest visual system on the planet.
p107
aVThey have another set of eyes on the top of their head.
p108
aVWe have no idea what they do.
p109
aVThey have sensors on their wing.
p110
aVTheir wing is covered with sensors, including sensors
p111
aVthat sense deformation of the wing.
p112
aVThey can even taste with their wings.
p113
aVOne of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has
p114
aVis a structure called the halteres.
p115
aVThe halteres are actually gyroscopes.
p116
aVThese devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight,
p117
aVand the animal can use them to sense its body rotation
p118
aVand initiate very, very fast corrective maneuvers.
p119
aVBut all of this sensory information has to be processed
p120
aVby a brain, and yes, indeed, flies have a brain,
p121
aVa brain of about 100,000 neurons.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow several people at this conference
p124
aVhave already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience
p125
aVbecause they're a simple model of brain function.
p126
aVAnd the basic punchline of my talk is,
p127
aVI'd like to turn that over on its head.
p128
aVI don't think they're a simple model of anything.
p129
aVAnd I think that flies are a great model.
p130
aVThey're a great model for flies.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd let's explore this notion of simplicity.
p134
aVSo I think, unfortunately, a lot of neuroscientists,
p135
aVwe're all somewhat narcissistic.
p136
aVWhen we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain.
p137
aVBut remember that this kind of brain,
p138
aVwhich is much, much smaller
p139
aV\u2014 instead of 100 billion neurons, it has 100,000 neurons \u2014
p140
aVbut this is the most common form of brain on the planet
p141
aVand has been for 400 million years.
p142
aVAnd is it fair to say that it's simple?
p143
aVWell, it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons,
p144
aVbut is that a fair metric?
p145
aVAnd I would propose it's not a fair metric.
p146
aVSo let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare \u2014
p147
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p148
aVwe have to compare the size of the brain
p149
aVwith what the brain can do.
p150
aVSo I propose we have a Trump number,
p151
aVand the Trump number is the ratio of this man's
p152
aVbehavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain.
p153
aVWe'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly.
p154
aVNow, how many people here think the Trump number
p155
aVis higher for the fruit fly?
p156
aa(lp157
V(Applause)
p158
aa(lp159
VIt's a very smart, smart audience.
p160
aVYes, the inequality goes in this direction, or I would posit it.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow I realize that it is a little bit absurd
p163
aVto compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly.
p164
aVBut let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse.
p165
aVA mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly.
p166
aVI used to study mice. When I studied mice,
p167
aVI used to talk really slowly.
p168
aVAnd then something happened when I started to work on flies.
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aVAnd I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice,
p171
aVit's really comparable. They have to forage for food.
p172
aVThey have to engage in courtship.
p173
aVThey have sex. They hide from predators.
p174
aVThey do a lot of the similar things.
p175
aVBut I would argue that flies do more.
p176
aVSo for example, I'm going to show you a sequence,
p177
aVand I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military,
p178
aVso I'm showing this classified sequence
p179
aVand you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay?
p180
aVSo I want you to look at the payload
p181
aVat the tail of the fruit fly.
p182
aVWatch it very closely,
p183
aVand you'll see why my six-year-old son
p184
aVnow wants to be a neuroscientist.
p185
aVWait for it.
p186
aVPshhew.
p187
aVSo at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice,
p188
aVthey're at least as clever as pigeons. (Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers
p191
aVbut also the challenge for a fly to compute
p192
aVeverything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons.
p193
aVSo this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse
p194
aVthat came from Jeff Lichtman's lab,
p195
aVand you can see the wonderful images of brains
p196
aVthat he showed in his talk.
p197
aVBut up in the corner, in the right corner, you'll see,
p198
aVat the same scale, a visual interneuron from a fly.
p199
aVAnd I'll expand this up.
p200
aVAnd it's a beautifully complex neuron.
p201
aVIt's just very, very tiny, and there's lots of biophysical challenges
p202
aVwith trying to compute information with tiny, tiny neurons.
p203
aa(lp204
VHow small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect.
p205
aVIt looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes,
p206
aVit has antennae, its legs, complicated life history,
p207
aVit's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars
p208
aVto parasatize,
p209
aVbut not only is its brain the size of a salt grain,
p210
aVwhich is comparable for a fruit fly,
p211
aVit is the size of a salt grain.
p212
aVSo here's some other organisms at the similar scale.
p213
aVThis animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba,
p214
aVand it has a brain of 7,000 neurons that's so small \u2014
p215
aVyou know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about,
p216
aVwhere the nucleus of the neuron is?
p217
aVThis animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space.
p218
aVSo this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience.
p219
aVI would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works.
p220
aa(lp221
VBut let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot?
p222
aVAnd I think, from an engineering perspective,
p223
aVyou think of multiplexing.
p224
aVYou can take a hardware and have that hardware
p225
aVdo different things at different times,
p226
aVor have different parts of the hardware doing different things.
p227
aVAnd these are the two concepts I'd like to explore.
p228
aVAnd they're not concepts that I've come up with,
p229
aVbut concepts that have been proposed by others in the past.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs.
p232
aVAnd I don't mean chewing the crabs.
p233
aVI grew up in Baltimore, and I chew crabs very, very well.
p234
aVBut I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing.
p235
aVCrab chewing is actually really fascinating.
p236
aVCrabs have this complicated structure under their carapace
p237
aVcalled the gastric mill
p238
aVthat grinds their food in a variety of different ways.
p239
aVAnd here's an endoscopic movie of this structure.
p240
aVThe amazing thing about this is that it's controlled
p241
aVby a really tiny set of neurons, about two dozen neurons
p242
aVthat can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns,
p243
aVand the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion
p244
aVin the crab is actually inundated by many, many neuromodulators.
p245
aVYou heard about neuromodulators earlier.
p246
aVThere are more neuromodulators
p247
aVthat alter, that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure,
p248
aVand they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns.
p249
aVAnd this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues
p250
aVwho've been studying this fascinating system
p251
aVthat show how a smaller cluster of neurons
p252
aVcan do many, many, many things
p253
aVbecause of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis.
p254
aVSo this is basically multiplexing in time.
p255
aVImagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator.
p256
aVYou select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior,
p257
aVanother neuromodulator, another set of cells,
p258
aVa different pattern, and you can imagine
p259
aVyou could extrapolate to a very, very complicated system.
p260
aa(lp261
VIs there any evidence that flies do this?
p262
aVWell, for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world,
p263
aVwe've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators.
p264
aVYou can tether a fly to a little stick.
p265
aVYou can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating.
p266
aVYou can let the fly play a little video game
p267
aVby letting it fly around in a visual display.
p268
aVSo let me show you a little tiny sequence of this.
p269
aVHere's a fly
p270
aVand a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator,
p271
aVand this is a game the flies love to play.
p272
aVYou allow them to steer towards the little stripe,
p273
aVand they'll just steer towards that stripe forever.
p274
aVIt's part of their visual guidance system.
p275
aVBut very, very recently, it's been possible
p276
aVto modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies.
p277
aVSo this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs,
p278
aVGaby Maimon, who's now at Rockefeller, developed,
p279
aVand it's basically a flight simulator
p280
aVbut under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode
p281
aVin the brain of the fly and record
p282
aVfrom a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain.
p283
aVAnd this is what one of these experiments looks like.
p284
aVIt was a sequence taken from another post-doc in the lab,
p285
aVBettina Schnell.
p286
aVThe green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential
p287
aVof a neuron in the fly's brain,
p288
aVand you'll see the fly start to fly, and the fly is actually
p289
aVcontrolling the rotation of that visual pattern itself
p290
aVby its own wing motion,
p291
aVand you can see this visual interneuron
p292
aVrespond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies.
p293
aVSo for the first time we've actually been able to record
p294
aVfrom neurons in the fly's brain while the fly
p295
aVis performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight.
p296
aVAnd one of the lessons we've been learning
p297
aVis that the physiology of cells that we've been studying
p298
aVfor many years in quiescent flies
p299
aVis not the same as the physiology of those cells
p300
aVwhen the flies actually engage in active behaviors
p301
aVlike flying and walking and so forth.
p302
aVAnd why is the physiology different?
p303
aVWell it turns out it's these neuromodulators,
p304
aVjust like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs.
p305
aVSo here's a picture of the octopamine system.
p306
aVOctopamine is a neuromodulator
p307
aVthat seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors.
p308
aVBut this is just one of many neuromodulators
p309
aVthat's in the fly's brain.
p310
aVSo I really think that, as we learn more,
p311
aVit's going to turn out that the whole fly brain
p312
aVis just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion,
p313
aVand that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons.
p314
aa(lp315
VNow, another idea, another way of multiplexing
p316
aVis multiplexing in space,
p317
aVhaving different parts of a neuron
p318
aVdo different things at the same time.
p319
aVSo here's two sort of canonical neurons
p320
aVfrom a vertebrate and an invertebrate,
p321
aVa human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal,
p322
aVand another cell to the right, a non-spiking interneuron,
p323
aVand this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago,
p324
aVand Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea
p325
aVbased on the fact that this neuron from a locust
p326
aVdoes not fire action potentials.
p327
aVIt's a non-spiking cell.
p328
aVSo a typical cell, like the neurons in our brain,
p329
aVhas a region called the dendrites that receives input,
p330
aVand that input sums together
p331
aVand will produce action potentials
p332
aVthat run down the axon and then activate
p333
aVall the output regions of the neuron.
p334
aVBut non-spiking neurons are actually quite complicated
p335
aVbecause they can have input synapses and output synapses
p336
aVall interdigitated, and there's no single action potential
p337
aVthat drives all the outputs at the same time.
p338
aVSo there's a possibility that you have computational compartments
p339
aVthat allow the different parts of the neuron
p340
aVto do different things at the same time.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo these basic concepts of multitasking in time
p343
aVand multitasking in space,
p344
aVI think these are things that are true in our brains as well,
p345
aVbut I think the insects are the true masters of this.
p346
aVSo I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time,
p347
aVand as I say up here, please think before you swat.

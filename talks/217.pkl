VI think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others
p5
aVthat I'm not going to talk about vaginas today.
p6
aVI began "The Vagina Monologues" because I was worried about vaginas.
p7
aVI'm very worried today about this notion, this world,
p8
aVthis prevailing kind of force of security.
p9
aVI see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere.
p10
aVReal security, security checks, security watch, security clearance.
p11
aVWhy has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?
p12
aVWhat does anyone mean when they talk about real security?
p13
aVAnd why have we, as Americans particularly,
p14
aVbecome a nation that strives for security above all else?
p15
aVIn fact, I think that security is elusive. It's impossible.
p16
aVWe all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us.
p17
aVPeople change us. Nothing is secure.
p18
aVAnd that's actually the good news.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure.
p21
aVI think that when that is the focus of your life,
p22
aVthese are the things that happen.
p23
aVYou can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle.
p24
aVYou can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time,
p25
aVas they might confuse you or challenge you.
p26
aVYou can't open yourself to new experiences, new people,
p27
aVnew ways of doing things \u2014 they might take you off course.
p28
aVYou can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity.
p29
aVYou become a Christian, Muslim, Jew.
p30
aVYou're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American.
p31
aVYou're a heterosexual or a homosexual, or you never have sex.
p32
aVOr at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself.
p33
aVYou become part of an "us."
p34
aVIn order to be secure, you defend against "them."
p35
aVYou cling to your land because it is your secure place.
p36
aVYou must fight anyone who encroaches upon it.
p37
aVYou become your nation. You become your religion.
p38
aVYou become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you
p39
aVand protect you from doubt or change.
p40
aVBut all this does, actually, is shut down your mind.
p41
aVIn reality, it does not really make you safer.
p42
aa(lp43
VI was in Sri Lanka, for example, three days after the tsunami,
p44
aVand I was standing on the beaches
p45
aVand it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes,
p46
aVa 30-foot wave could rise up
p47
aVand desecrate a people, a population and lives.
p48
aVAll this striving for security, in fact,
p49
aVhas made you much more insecure
p50
aVbecause now you have to watch out all the time.
p51
aVThere are people not like you \u2014 people who you now call enemies.
p52
aVYou have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think,
p53
aVworlds that you can no longer inhabit.
p54
aVAnd so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory
p55
aVand becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking.
p56
aVYour days become devoted to protecting yourself.
p57
aVThis becomes your mission. That is all you do.
p58
aVIdeas get shorter. They become sound bytes.
p59
aVThere are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.
p60
aa(lp61
VThere are those who, if they're not with us, are against us.
p62
aVIt gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them.
p63
aVIt gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them,
p64
aVoccupy them, invade them and kill them,
p65
aVbecause they are only obstacles now to your security.
p66
aVIn six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day,
p67
aVa global movement against [violence against] women,
p68
aVto travel probably to 60 countries,
p69
aVand spend a great deal of time in different portions.
p70
aVI've met women and men all over this planet,
p71
aVwho through various circumstances \u2014
p72
aVwar, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence \u2014
p73
aVhave never known security,
p74
aVor have had their illusion of security forever devastated.
p75
aVI've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban,
p76
aVwho were essentially brutalized and censored.
p77
aVI've been in Bosnian refugee camps.
p78
aVI was with women in Pakistan
p79
aVwho have had their faces melted off with acid.
p80
aVI've been with girls all across America who were date-raped,
p81
aVor raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.
p82
aa(lp83
VOne of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels
p84
aVis that there is this emerging species.
p85
aVI loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world.
p86
aVI've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world,
p87
aVwe call Vagina Warriors.
p88
aVThese particular people, rather than getting AK-47s,
p89
aVor weapons of mass destruction, or machetes,
p90
aVin the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss.
p91
aVThey have grieved it, they have died into it,
p92
aVand allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.
p93
aVThey have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy
p94
aVtowards another mission and another trajectory.
p95
aa(lp96
VThese warriors now devote themselves and their lives
p97
aVto making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.
p98
aVThere are thousands if not millions of them on the planet.
p99
aVI venture there are many in this room.
p100
aVThey have a fierceness and a freedom
p101
aVthat I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm.
p102
aVThey have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator.
p103
aVTheir own personal security is not their end goal,
p104
aVand because of that, because, rather than worrying about security,
p105
aVbecause the transformation of suffering is their end goal,
p106
aVI actually believe they are creating real safety
p107
aVand a whole new idea of security.
p108
aVI want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.
p109
aa(lp110
VTomorrow, I am going to Cairo,
p111
aVand I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo
p112
aVwho are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house
p113
aVfor battered women in the Middle East.
p114
aVThat will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up
p115
aVand put themselves on the line,
p116
aVand talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt,
p117
aVand were willing to be attacked and criticized.
p118
aVAnd through their work over the last years,
p119
aVthis is not only happening that this house is opening,
p120
aVbut it's being supported by many factions of the society
p121
aVwho never would have supported it.
p122
aVWomen in Uganda this year,
p123
aVwho put on "The Vagina Monologues" during V-Day,
p124
aVactually evoked the wrath of the government.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd, I love this story so much.
p127
aVThere was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents
p128
aVto talk about whether "Vaginas" could come to Uganda.
p129
aVAnd in this meeting \u2014 it went on for weeks in the press,
p130
aVtwo weeks where there was huge discussion.
p131
aVThe government finally made a decision
p132
aVthat "The Vagina Monologues" could not be performed in Uganda.
p133
aVBut the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women,
p134
aVand because they had been willing to risk their security,
p135
aVit began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda,
p136
aVbut all of Africa.
p137
aVAs a result, this production, which had already sold out,
p138
aVevery single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people,
p139
aVmade a decision to keep the money.
p140
aVThey raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.
p141
aa(lp142
VThere's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota.
p143
aVShe's a high school student.
p144
aVShe had seen "The Vagina Monologues" and she was really moved. And as a result,
p145
aVshe wore an "I heart my vagina" button to her high school in Minnesota.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VShe was basically threatened to be expelled from school.
p150
aVThey told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school,
p151
aVthat it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing,
p152
aVthat it was not a good thing.
p153
aVSo she really struggled with this, what to do,
p154
aVbecause she was a senior and she was doing well in her school
p155
aVand she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together \u2014
p156
aVI believe it was 100, 150 students
p157
aVall wore "I love my vagina" T-shirts,
p158
aVand the boys wore "I love her vagina" T-shirts to school.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VNow this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous,
p163
aVbut what happened as a result of that, is that that school now
p164
aVis forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex,
p165
aVit's beginning to look at why it would be wrong
p166
aVfor a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly
p167
aVor to say that she loved her vagina publicly.
p168
aa(lp169
VI know I've talked about Agnes here before,
p170
aVbut I want to give you an update on Agnes.
p171
aVI met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley.
p172
aVWhen she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will.
p173
aVThat mutilation of her clitoris
p174
aVhad actually obviously impacted her life
p175
aVand changed it in a way that was devastating.
p176
aVShe made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard,
p177
aVbut to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls.
p178
aVFor eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley.
p179
aVShe had this amazing box that she carried and it had a
p180
aVtorso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso,
p181
aVand she would teach people, everywhere she went,
p182
aVwhat a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like.
p183
aVIn the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.
p184
aVShe saved 1,500 girls from being cut.
p185
aa(lp186
VWhen V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her
p187
aVand she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep,
p188
aVI could get around a lot faster." So, we bought her a Jeep.
p189
aVIn the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.
p190
aVSo, we said, what else could we do?
p191
aVShe said, "If you help me get money, I could open a house."
p192
aVThree years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.
p193
aVWhen she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled,
p194
aVshe was detested, she was completely slandered in her community.
p195
aVI am proud to tell you that six months ago,
p196
aVshe was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Applause)
p199
aa(lp200
VI think what I'm trying to say here
p201
aVis that if your end goal is security,
p202
aVand if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening
p203
aVis that you create not only more insecurity in other people,
p204
aVbut you make yourself far more insecure.
p205
aVReal security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.
p206
aVNot running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.
p207
aVReal security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.
p208
aVReal security is hungering for connection rather than power.
p209
aVIt cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.
p210
aVIt is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness
p211
aVthat we are all utterly inter-bended,
p212
aVand one action by one being in one tiny town
p213
aVhas consequences everywhere.
p214
aVReal security is not only being able
p215
aVto tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them
p216
aVand only trusting a situation when they are present.
p217
aa(lp218
VSomething happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost.
p219
aVI remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa,
p220
aVand I had no idea where I was.
p221
aVI didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from,
p222
aVand I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack.
p223
aVAnd then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter
p224
aVwhere I was going, or where I had come from
p225
aVbecause we are all essentially permanently displaced people.
p226
aVAll of us are refugees.
p227
aVWe come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time,
p228
aVmoving towards a new place.
p229
aVFreedom means I may not be identified as any one group,
p230
aVbut that I can visit and find myself in every group.
p231
aVIt does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs,
p232
aVbut it does mean I am not hardened around them.
p233
aVI do not use them as weapons.
p234
aVIn the shared future, it will be just that, shared.
p235
aVThe end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable,
p236
aVrealizing the place of our connection to one another,
p237
aVrather than becoming secure, in control and alone.
p238
aVThank you very much.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Applause)
p241
aa(lp242
VChris Anderson: And how are you doing? Are you exhausted?
p243
aVOn a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom?
p244
aVEve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said
p245
aVthat in order to survive the twentieth century,
p246
aVwe have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time.
p247
aVAnd I think part of what I'm learning in this process
p248
aVis that one must allow oneself to feel grief.
p249
aVAnd I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping,
p250
aVand then moving on, I'm fine.
p251
aVWhen I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me,
p252
aVand isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble.
p253
aVBecause when you spend a lot of time going from place to place,
p254
aVcountry to country, and city to city,
p255
aVthe degree to which women, for example, are violated,
p256
aVand the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it,
p257
aVis so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time,
p258
aVor I have to take the time now, to process that.
p259
aa(lp260
VCA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about,
p261
aVyou know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one.
p262
aVWhy this one?
p263
aVEE: I think that if you think about women,
p264
aVwomen are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth,
p265
aVwe come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries,
p266
aVthey are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says
p267
aVthat one out of three women on the planet
p268
aVwill be raped or beaten in their lifetime,
p269
aVwe're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet,
p270
aVwe're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting.
p271
aVImagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child.
p272
aVHow does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future,
p273
aVor thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is
p274
aVif we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women,
p275
aVit would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.

The play recounts <strong>tender, funny, gripping and horrifying stories she gathered from hundreds of women</strong> about their bodies, their sexual experiences, and yes, their vaginas. Since its first staging in 1996, it has been translated into more than 45 languages, performed in more than 120 countries and re-created as an HBO film. <br /><br /><em>The Vagina Monologues</em>&#39; success allowed Ensler to create <strong><a href=\\"http://www.vday.org/main.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">V-Day</a></strong>, <strong>a global activist movement to end violence against women and girls, which has so far raised $85 million</strong> to prevent violence and protect abused women. In February 2011, Ensler received the Isabelle Stephenson Tony Award for her philanthropic work. Ensler has also drawn praise for <em><a href=\\"http://www.thegoodbody.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Good Body</a>,</em> a play that cuts to women&#39;s obsession with their appearance, and her film <a href=\\"http://www.pbs.org/pov/whatiwant/\\"><em>What I Want My Words to Do to You</em></a>, which portrays a writing group she leads at a correctional facility for women.

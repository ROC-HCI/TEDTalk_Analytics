VThis is the skyline of my hometown, New Orleans.
p5
aVIt was a great place to grow up,
p6
aVbut it's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world.
p7
aVHalf the city is already below sea level.
p8
aVIn 2005, the world watched as New Orleans
p9
aVand the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
p10
aVOne thousand, eight hundred and thirty-six people died. Nearly 300,000 homes were lost.
p11
aVThese are my mother's, at the top \u2014
p12
aValthough that's not her car,
p13
aVit was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof \u2014
p14
aVand that's my sister's, below.
p15
aVFortunately, they and other family members got out in time,
p16
aVbut they lost their homes, and as you can see,
p17
aVjust about everything in them.
p18
aa(lp19
VOther parts of the world have been hit by storms
p20
aVin even more devastating ways.
p21
aVIn 2008, Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath
p22
aVkilled 138,000 in Myanmar.
p23
aVClimate change is affecting our homes, our communities,
p24
aVour way of life. We should be preparing
p25
aVat every scale and at every opportunity.
p26
aVThis talk is about being prepared for, and resilient to
p27
aVthe changes that are coming and that will affect our homes
p28
aVand our collective home, the Earth.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe changes in these times won't affect us all equally.
p31
aVThere are important distributional consequences,
p32
aVand they're not what you always might think.
p33
aVIn New Orleans, the elderly and female-headed households
p34
aVwere among the most vulnerable.
p35
aVFor those in vulnerable, low-lying nations,
p36
aVhow do you put a dollar value on losing your country
p37
aVwhere you ancestors are buried? And where will your people go?
p38
aVAnd how will they cope in a foreign land?
p39
aVWill there be tensions over immigration,
p40
aVor conflicts over competition for limited resources?
p41
aVIt's already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur.
p42
aVLike it or not, ready or not, this is our future.
p43
aa(lp44
VSure, some are looking for opportunities in this new world.
p45
aVThat's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom
p46
aVto stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice.
p47
aVBut while there might be some short-term individual winners,
p48
aVour collective losses will far outweigh them.
p49
aVLook no further than the insurance industry as they struggle
p50
aVto cope with mounting catastrophic losses
p51
aVfrom extreme weather events.
p52
aVThe military gets it. They call climate change
p53
aVa threat multiplier that could harm stability and security,
p54
aVwhile governments around the world are evaluating
p55
aVhow to respond.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo what can we do? How can we prepare and adapt?
p58
aVI'd like to share three sets of examples, starting with
p59
aVadapting to violent storms and floods.
p60
aVIn New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans,
p61
aVwith sections knocked out in Katrina, have been rebuilt
p62
aV21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge.
p63
aVAnd these raised and energy-efficient homes
p64
aVwere developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right
p65
aVfor the hard-hit Ninth Ward.
p66
aVThe devastated church my mom attends has been
p67
aVnot only rebuilt higher, it's poised to become
p68
aVthe first Energy Star church in the country.
p69
aVThey're selling electricity back to the grid
p70
aVthanks to solar panels, reflective paint and more.
p71
aVTheir March electricity bill was only 48 dollars.
p72
aVNow these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way,
p73
aVbut better if others act proactively with these changes in mind.
p74
aVFor example, in Galveston, here's a resilient home
p75
aVthat survived Hurricane Ike,
p76
aVwhen others on neighboring lots clearly did not.
p77
aVAnd around the world, satellites and warning systems
p78
aVare saving lives in flood-prone areas such as Bangladesh.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut as important as technology and infrastructure are,
p81
aVperhaps the human element is even more critical.
p82
aVWe need better planning and systems for evacuation.
p83
aVWe need to better understand how people make decisions
p84
aVin times of crisis, and why.
p85
aVWhile it's true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation,
p86
aVothers who did refused to leave as the storm approached,
p87
aVoften because available transportation and shelters
p88
aVrefused to allow them to take their pets.
p89
aVImagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue.
p90
aVFortunately in 2006, Congress passed
p91
aVthe Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act (Laughter)
p92
aV\u2014 it spells "PETS" \u2014 to change that.
p93
aa(lp94
VSecond, preparing for heat and drought.
p95
aVFarmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia
p96
aVto Africa, from Australia to Oklahoma,
p97
aVwhile heat waves linked with climate change
p98
aVhave killed tens of thousands of people
p99
aVin Western Europe in 2003, and again in Russia in 2010.
p100
aVIn Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0 percent of the population,
p101
aVdepends on rainfall for its livelihood.
p102
aVOxfam and Swiss Re, together with Rockefeller Foundation,
p103
aVare helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces
p104
aVand find other ways to conserve water,
p105
aVbut they're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come.
p106
aVThe stability this provides is giving the farmers
p107
aVthe confidence to invest.
p108
aVIt's giving them access to affordable credit.
p109
aVIt's allowing them to become more productive so that
p110
aVthey can afford their own insurance over time, without assistance.
p111
aVIt's a virtuous cycle, and one that could be replicated
p112
aVthroughout the developing world.
p113
aVAfter a lethal 1995 heat wave
p114
aVturned refrigerator trucks from the popular
p115
aVTaste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues,
p116
aVChicago became a recognized leader,
p117
aVtamping down on the urban heat island impact
p118
aVthrough opening cooling centers,
p119
aVoutreach to vulnerable neighborhoods, planting trees,
p120
aVcreating cool white or vegetated green roofs.
p121
aVThis is City Hall's green roof, next to Cook County's [portion of the] roof,
p122
aVwhich is 77 degrees Fahrenheit hotter at the surface.
p123
aVWashington, D.C., last year, actually led the nation
p124
aVin new green roofs installed, and they're funding this in part
p125
aVthanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.
p126
aVThey're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs
p127
aVwith home and building owners.
p128
aVThe roofs not only temper urban heat island impact
p129
aVbut they save energy, and therefore money,
p130
aVthe emissions that cause climate change,
p131
aVand they also reduce stormwater runoff.
p132
aVSo some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins.
p133
aa(lp134
VThird, adapting to rising seas.
p135
aVSea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems, agriculture,
p136
aVeven major cities. This is what one to two meters
p137
aVof sea level rise looks like in the Mekong Delta.
p138
aVThat's where half of Vietnam's rice is grown.
p139
aVInfrastructure is going to be affected.
p140
aVAirports around the world are located on the coast.
p141
aVIt makes sense, right? There's open space,
p142
aVthe planes can take off and land without worrying about
p143
aVcreating noise or avoiding tall buildings.
p144
aVHere's just one example, San Francisco Airport,
p145
aVwith 16 inches or more of flooding.
p146
aVImagine the staggering cost of protecting
p147
aVthis vital infrastructure with levees.
p148
aVBut there might be some changes in store
p149
aVthat you might not imagine. For example,
p150
aVplanes require more runway for takeoff
p151
aVbecause the heated, less dense air, provides for less lift.
p152
aVSan Francisco is also spending 40 million dollars
p153
aVto rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment,
p154
aVas water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater,
p155
aVcausing backups at the plant, harming the bacteria
p156
aVthat are needed to treat the waste.
p157
aVSo these outfall pipes have been retrofitted
p158
aVto shut seawater off from entering the system.
p159
aa(lp160
VBeyond these technical solutions, our work
p161
aVat the Georgetown Climate Center with communities
p162
aVencourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available
p163
aVand to consider how they can accommodate change.
p164
aVFor example, in land use, which areas do you want
p165
aVto protect, through adding a seawall, for example,
p166
aValter, by raising buildings, or retreat from,
p167
aVto allow the migration of important natural systems,
p168
aVsuch as wetlands or beaches?
p169
aVOther examples to consider. In the U.K.,
p170
aVthe Thames Barrier protects London from storm surge.
p171
aVThe Asian Cities Climate [Change] Resilience Network
p172
aVis restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves.
p173
aVThese are not only important ecosystems in their own right,
p174
aVbut they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities.
p175
aVNew York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms,
p176
aVas you can see from this clever sign, and to sea level rise,
p177
aVand to storm surge, as you can see from the subway flooding.
p178
aVBut back above ground, these raised ventilation grates
p179
aVfor the subway system show that solutions can be both
p180
aVfunctional and attractive. In fact, in New York,
p181
aVSan Francisco and London, designers have envisioned
p182
aVways to better integrate the natural and built environments
p183
aVwith climate change in mind.
p184
aVI think these are inspiring examples of what's possible
p185
aVwhen we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different.
p186
aa(lp187
VBut now, a word of caution.
p188
aVAdaptation's too important to be left to the experts.
p189
aVWhy? Well, there are no experts.
p190
aVWe're entering uncharted territory, and yet
p191
aVour expertise and our systems are based on the past.
p192
aV"Stationarity" is the notion that we can anticipate the future
p193
aVbased on the past, and plan accordingly,
p194
aVand this principle governs much of our engineering,
p195
aVour design of critical infrastructure, city water systems,
p196
aVbuilding codes, even water rights and other legal precedents.
p197
aVBut we can simply no longer rely on established norms.
p198
aVWe're operating outside the bounds of CO2 concentrations
p199
aVthat the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe larger point I'm trying to make is this.
p202
aVIt's up to us to look at our homes and our communities,
p203
aVour vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk,
p204
aVand to find ways to not just survive, but to thrive,
p205
aVand it's up to us to plan and to prepare
p206
aVand to call on our government leaders and require them
p207
aVto do the same, even while they address
p208
aVthe underlying causes of climate change.
p209
aVThere are no quick fixes.
p210
aVThere are no one-size-fits-all solutions.
p211
aVWe're all learning by doing.
p212
aVBut the operative word is doing.
p213
aa(lp214
VThank you.

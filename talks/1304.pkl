VBen Roche: So I'm Ben, by the way.
p5
aVHomaro Cantu: And I'm Homaro.
p6
aVBR: And we're chefs. So when Moto
p7
aVopened in 2004, people didn't really know
p8
aVwhat to expect. A lot of people thought
p9
aVthat it was a Japanese restaurant, and
p10
aVmaybe it was the name, maybe it was
p11
aVthe logo, which was like a Japanese
p12
aVcharacter, but anyway, we had all these
p13
aVrequests for Japanese food, which is
p14
aVreally not what we did. And after about
p15
aVthe ten thousandth request for a maki roll,
p16
aVwe decided to give the people
p17
aVwhat they wanted. So this picture is
p18
aVan example of printed food, and this was
p19
aVthe first foray into what we like to call
p20
aVflavor transformation. So this is all
p21
aVthe ingredients, all the flavor of, you know,
p22
aVa standard maki roll, printed onto
p23
aVa little piece of paper.
p24
aa(lp25
VHC: So our diners started to get bored
p26
aVwith this idea, and we decided to give them
p27
aVthe same course twice, so here we actually
p28
aVtook an element from the maki roll and
p29
aVand took a picture of a dish and then
p30
aVbasically served that picture with the dish.
p31
aVSo this dish in particular is basically
p32
aVchampagne with seafood.
p33
aVThe champagne grapes that you see are
p34
aVactually carbonated grapes. A little bit of
p35
aVseafood and some crème fraiche and the
p36
aVpicture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter)
p37
aVBR: But it's not all just edible pictures.
p38
aVWe decided to do something
p39
aVa little bit different and transform flavors
p40
aVthat were very familiar \u2014 so in this case,
p41
aVwe have carrot cake.
p42
aVSo we take a carrot cake, put it
p43
aVin a blender, and we have kind of like
p44
aVa carrot cake juice, and then that went into
p45
aVa balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create
p46
aVthis hollow shell of carrot cake
p47
aVice cream, I guess, and it comes off
p48
aVlooking like, you know,
p49
aVJupiter's floating around your plate.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo yeah, we're transforming things into
p52
aVsomething that you have absolutely
p53
aVno reference for.
p54
aVHC: And here's something we have no
p55
aVreference to eat. This is a cigar, and
p56
aVbasically it's a Cuban cigar made out of
p57
aVa Cuban pork sandwich, so we take these
p58
aVspices that go into the pork shoulder,
p59
aVwe fashion that into ash. We take
p60
aVthe sandwich and wrap it up in
p61
aVa collard green, put an edible label
p62
aVthat bears no similarity to
p63
aVa Cohiba cigar label, and we put it
p64
aVin a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and charge
p65
aVyou about twenty bucks for it. (Laughter)
p66
aVHC: Delicious.
p67
aa(lp68
VBR: That's not it, though.
p69
aVInstead of making foods that
p70
aVlook like things that you wouldn't eat,
p71
aVwe decided to make ingredients
p72
aVlook like dishes that you know.
p73
aVSo this is a plate of nachos.
p74
aVThe difference between our nachos
p75
aVand the other guy's nachos,
p76
aVis that this is actually a dessert.
p77
aVSo the chips are candied,
p78
aVthe ground beef is made from chocolate,
p79
aVand the cheese is made from a shredded
p80
aVmango sorbet that gets shredded
p81
aVinto liquid nitrogen to look like cheese.
p82
aVAnd after doing all of this
p83
aVdematerialization and reconfiguring
p84
aVof this, of these ingredients, we realized
p85
aVthat it was pretty cool,
p86
aVbecause as we served it, we learned that
p87
aVthe dish actually behaves like the real thing,
p88
aVwhere the cheese begins to melt.
p89
aVSo when you're looking at this thing
p90
aVin the dining room, you have this sensation
p91
aVthat this is actually a plate of nachos,
p92
aVand it's not really until you begin tasting it
p93
aVthat you realize this is a dessert, and
p94
aVit's just kind of like a mind-ripper.
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VHC: So we had been creating
p98
aVall of these dishes out of a
p99
aVkitchen that was more like
p100
aVa mechanic's shop than a kitchen, and
p101
aVthe next logical step for us was to install
p102
aVa state-of-the-art laboratory,
p103
aVand that's what we have here.
p104
aVSo we put this in the basement, and we
p105
aVgot really serious about food, like
p106
aVserious experimentation.
p107
aVBR: One of the really cool things about
p108
aVthe lab, besides that we have a new
p109
aVscience lab in the kitchen, is that,
p110
aVyou know, with this new equipment, and
p111
aVthis new approach, all these
p112
aVdifferent doors to creativity that we never
p113
aVknew were there began to open, and so the
p114
aVexperiments and the food and the dishes
p115
aVthat we created, they just kept going
p116
aVfurther and further out there.
p117
aa(lp118
VHC: Let's talk about flavor transformation,
p119
aVand let's actually make some cool stuff.
p120
aVYou see a cow with its tongue hanging out.
p121
aVWhat I see is a cow about to eat something
p122
aVdelicious. What is that cow eating?
p123
aVAnd why is it delicious?
p124
aVSo the cow, basically, eats three basic
p125
aVthings in their feed: corn, beets, and barley,
p126
aVand so what I do is I actually
p127
aVchallenge my staff with these crazy,
p128
aVwild ideas. Can we take what the cow
p129
aVeats, remove the cow, and then make
p130
aVsome hamburgers out of that?
p131
aVAnd basically the reaction tends to be
p132
aVkind of like this. (Laughter)
p133
aVBR: Yeah, that's our chef de cuisine,
p134
aVChris Jones. This is not the only guy
p135
aVthat just flips out when we assign
p136
aVa ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas,
p137
aVthey're hard to understand.
p138
aVThey're hard to just get automatically.
p139
aa(lp140
VThere's a lot of research and a lot of
p141
aVfailure, trial and error \u2014 I guess, more error \u2014
p142
aVthat goes into each and every dish,
p143
aVso we don't always get it right, and it takes
p144
aVa while for us to be able to explain that
p145
aVto people.
p146
aVHC: So, after about a day of Chris and I
p147
aVstaring at each other, we came up with
p148
aVsomething that was pretty close
p149
aVto the hamburger patty, and as you can
p150
aVsee it basically forms like hamburger meat.
p151
aVThis is made from three ingredients:
p152
aVbeets, barley, corn, and so it
p153
aVactually cooks up like hamburger meat,
p154
aVlooks and tastes like hamburger meat,
p155
aVand not only that, but it's basically
p156
aVremoving the cow from the equation.
p157
aVSo replicating food, taking it into that
p158
aVnext level is where we're going.
p159
aV(Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VBR: And it's definitely the world's first
p162
aVbleeding veggie burger,
p163
aVwhich is a cool side effect.
p164
aVAnd a miracle berry, if you're not familiar
p165
aVwith it, is a natural ingredient, and it
p166
aVcontains a special property.
p167
aVIt's a glycoprotein called miraculin,
p168
aVa naturally occurring thing. It still freaks
p169
aVme out every time I eat it, but it has a
p170
aVunique ability to mask certain taste
p171
aVreceptors on your tongue, so that primarily
p172
aVsour taste receptors, so normally things
p173
aVthat would taste very sour or tart,
p174
aVsomehow begin to taste very sweet.
p175
aVHC: You're about to eat a lemon,
p176
aVand now it tastes like lemonade.
p177
aVLet's just stop and think about the
p178
aVeconomic benefits of something like that.
p179
aVWe could eliminate sugar across the board
p180
aVfor all confectionary products and sodas,
p181
aVand we can replace it with
p182
aVall-natural fresh fruit.
p183
aa(lp184
VBR: So you see us here cutting up
p185
aVsome watermelon. The idea with this
p186
aVis that we're going to eliminate tons of
p187
aVfood miles, wasted energy,
p188
aVand overfishing of tuna by creating tuna,
p189
aVor any exotic produce or item
p190
aVfrom a very far-away place,
p191
aVwith local, organic produce;
p192
aVso we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.
p193
aVHC: So if miracle berries take sour things
p194
aVand turn them into sweet things,
p195
aVwe have this other pixie dust
p196
aVthat we put on the watermelon, and it
p197
aVmakes it go from sweet to savory.
p198
aVSo after we do that, we put it into
p199
aVa vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed,
p200
aVsome spices, and we roll it, and this
p201
aVstarts taking on the appearance of tuna.
p202
aVSo the key now is to make it
p203
aVbehave like tuna.
p204
aVBR: And then after a quick dip into some
p205
aVliquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear,
p206
aVwe really have something that looks,
p207
aVtastes and behaves like the real thing.
p208
aa(lp209
VHC: So the key thing to remember here is,
p210
aVwe don't really care
p211
aVwhat this tuna really is.
p212
aVAs long as it's good for you and good for
p213
aVthe environment, it doesn't matter.
p214
aVBut where is this going?
p215
aVHow can we take this idea of tricking your
p216
aVtastebuds and leapfrog it into something
p217
aVthat we can do today that could be
p218
aVa disruptive food technology?
p219
aVSo here's the next challenge.
p220
aVI told the staff, let's just take a bunch
p221
aVof wild plants, think of them as
p222
aVfood ingredients. As long as they're
p223
aVnon-poisonous to the human body,
p224
aVgo out around Chicago sidewalks,
p225
aVtake it, blend it, cook it and then
p226
aVhave everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto.
p227
aVLet's charge them a boatload of cash for this
p228
aVand see what they think. (Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VBR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a task
p231
aVlike this \u2014 this is another one of those
p232
aVassignments that the kitchen staff
p233
aVhated us for. But we really had to almost
p234
aVrelearn how to cook in general,
p235
aVbecause these are ingredients, you know,
p236
aVplant life that we're, one, unfamiliar with,
p237
aVand two, we have no reference for how
p238
aVto cook these things because
p239
aVpeople don't eat them.
p240
aVSo we really had to think about new, creative ways
p241
aVto flavor, new ways to cook
p242
aVand to change texture \u2014 and that was
p243
aVthe main issue with this challenge.
p244
aa(lp245
VHC: So this is where we step into the future
p246
aVand we leapfrog ahead.
p247
aVSo developing nations
p248
aVand first-world nations,
p249
aVimagine if you could take these wild plants
p250
aVand consume them, food miles would
p251
aVbasically turn into food feet.
p252
aVThis disruptive mentality of what food is
p253
aVwould essentially open up the encyclopedia
p254
aVof what raw ingredients are, even if we just
p255
aVswapped out, say, one of these for flour,
p256
aVthat would eliminate so much energy
p257
aVand so much waste.
p258
aVAnd to give you a simple example here as to
p259
aVwhat we actually fed these customers,
p260
aVthere's a bale of hay there
p261
aVand some crab apples.
p262
aVAnd basically we took hay and crab apples
p263
aVand made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients.
p264
aVPeople swore they were eating
p265
aVbarbecue sauce, and this is free food.
p266
aVBR: Thanks, guys.

VThere are a lot of web 2.0 consultants who make a lot of money.
p5
aVIn fact, they make their living on this stuff.
p6
aVI'm going to try to save you all the time and money
p7
aVand go through it in the next three minutes, so bear with me.
p8
aVStarted a website in 2005 with a few friends, called Reddit.com.
p9
aVIt's what you'd call a social news website;
p10
aa(lp11
Vbasically, the democratic front page of the best stuff on the web.
p12
aVYou find some interesting content \u2014 say, a TED Talk \u2014 submit it to Reddit,
p13
aVand a community of your peers votes up if they like it, down if they don't.
p14
aVThat creates the front page.
p15
aVIt's always rising, falling; a half million people visit every day.
p16
aVBut this isn't about Reddit.
p17
aVIt's about discovering new things that pop up on the web.
p18
aVIn the last four years, we've seen all kinds of memes,
p19
aVall kinds of trends get born right on our front page.
p20
aa(lp21
VThis isn't about Reddit itself, it's actually about humpback whales.
p22
aVWell, technically, it's about Greenpeace, an environmental organization
p23
aVthat wanted to stop the Japanese government's whaling campaign.
p24
aVThe whales were getting killed; they wanted to put an end to it.
p25
aVOne of the ways they wanted to do it
p26
aVwas to put a tracking chip inside one of the whales.
p27
aVBut to personify the movement, they wanted to name it.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo in true web fashion, they put together a poll,
p30
aVwhere they had a bunch of very erudite, very thoughtful, cultured names.
p31
aVI believe this is the Farsi word for "immortal."
p32
aVI think this means "divine power of the ocean" in a Polynesian language.
p33
aVAnd then there was this: "Mister Splashy Pants."
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd this was a special name.
p38
aVMister Pants, or "Splashy" to his friends, was very popular on the Internet.
p39
aVIn fact, someone on Reddit thought,
p40
aV"What a great thing, we should all vote this up."
p41
aVAnd Redditors responded and all agreed.
p42
aVSo the voting started.
p43
aVWe got behind it ourselves; we changed our logo for the day,
p44
aVfrom the alien to Splashy, to help the cause.
p45
aVAnd it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing
p46
aVand the rest of the Internet started saying, "We love Splashy Pants!"
p47
aa(lp48
VSo it went from about five percent, which was when this meme started,
p49
aVto 70 percent at the end of voting.
p50
aVPretty impressive, right? We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen.
p51
aVJust kidding \u2014 Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it,
p52
aVbecause they wanted one of the more thoughtful names to win.
p53
aVThey said, "No, just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting."
p54
aa(lp55
VWell, that got us a little angry, so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd the Reddit community \u2014 really, the rest of the Internet,
p60
aVreally got behind this.
p61
aVFacebook groups were created.
p62
aVFacebook applications were created.
p63
aVThe idea was, "Vote your conscience, vote for Mister Splashy Pants."
p64
aVPeople were putting up signs in the real world about this whale.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VThis was the final vote: 78 percent of the votes.
p69
aVTo give you an idea of the landslide, the next highest name pulled in three.
p70
aa(lp71
VThere was a clear lesson: the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.
p72
aVWhich is obvious. It's a great name.
p73
aVEveryone wants to hear their news anchor say, "Mister Splashy Pants."
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VI think that's what helped drive this.
p78
aVWhat was cool were the repercussions.
p79
aVGreenpeace created an entire marketing campaign around it \u2014
p80
aVMister Splashy Pants shirts and pins,
p81
aVan e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy.
p82
aVBut even more important was that they accomplished their mission.
p83
aVThe Japanese government called off their whaling expedition.
p84
aVMission accomplished: Greenpeace was thrilled,
p85
aVthe whales were happy \u2014 that's a quote.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd actually, Redditors in the Internet community
p90
aVwere happy to participate, but they weren't whale lovers.
p91
aVA few, certainly, but we're talking about a lot of people,
p92
aVreally interested and caught up in this meme.
p93
aVGreenpeace came back to the site and thanked Reddit for its participation.
p94
aVBut this wasn't really altruism; just interest in doing something cool.
p95
aa(lp96
VThis is how the Internet works. This is that great big secret.
p97
aVThe Internet provides a level playing field.
p98
aVYour link is as good as your link, which is as good as my link.
p99
aVWith a browser, anyone can get to any website no matter your budget.
p100
aVThat is, as long as you can keep net neutrality in place.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnother important thing is it costs nothing to get content online.
p103
aVThere are so many publishing tools available,
p104
aVit only takes a few minutes to produce something.
p105
aVand the cost of iteration is so cheap, you might as well.
p106
aa(lp107
VIf you do, be genuine. Be honest, up-front.
p108
aVOne of the great lessons Greenpeace learned
p109
aVis that it's OK to lose control,
p110
aVOK to take yourself a little less seriously,
p111
aVgiven that, even though it's a very serious cause,
p112
aVyou could ultimately achieve your goal.
p113
aVThat's the final message I want to share: you can do well online.
p114
aVBut no longer is the message coming from just the top down.
p115
aVIf you want to succeed you've got to be OK to lose control.
p116
aa(lp117
VThank you.

action</strong>. Founded in 2005, it grew a user base of tens of thousands and quickly attracted the attention of publisher Cond<em>&eacute;</em> Nast, which acquired it in 2006. Unlike &quot;social bookmarking&quot; sites (such as Delicious), Reddit fashions itself a platform for &quot;social news,&quot; where the readers themselves control the front page by voting stories up above and down below the fold.</p><p>Ohanian left Reddit in his official capacity in 2009, but returned in 2014 as executive chairman. He has continued to be involved with the site&#39;s direction as a sort of godfather, dispensing friendly wisdom (and t-shirts) from his user account, <a href=\\"http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing\\" target=\\"_blank\\">kn0thing</a>. Of late, he&#39;s focusing on Breadpig, a hub for geeky books and merchandise.

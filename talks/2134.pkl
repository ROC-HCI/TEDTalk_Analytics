VOn January 4, 1934,
p5
aVa young man delivered a report
p6
aVto the United States Congress
p7
aVthat 80 years on,
p8
aVstill shapes the lives of everyone in this room today,
p9
aVstill shapes the lives of everyone on this planet.
p10
aVThat young man wasn't a politician,
p11
aVhe wasn't a businessman,
p12
aVa civil rights activist
p13
aVor a faith leader.
p14
aVHe was that most unlikely of heroes,
p15
aVan economist.
p16
aVHis name was Simon Kuznets
p17
aVand the report that  he delivered was called
p18
aV"National Income, 1929-1932."
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, you might think
p21
aVthis is a rather dry and dull report.
p22
aVAnd you're absolutely right.
p23
aVIt's dry as a bone.
p24
aVBut this report is the foundation
p25
aVof how, today, we judge the  success of countries:
p26
aVwhat we know best as Gross Domestic Product,
p27
aVGDP.
p28
aa(lp29
VGDP has defined and shaped our lives
p30
aVfor the last 80 years.
p31
aVAnd today I want to talk about
p32
aVa different way to measure the success of countries,
p33
aVa different way to define  and shape our lives
p34
aVfor the next 80 years.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut first, we have to understand
p37
aVhow GDP came to dominate our lives.
p38
aVKuznets' report was delivered
p39
aVat a moment of crisis.
p40
aVThe U.S. economy was plummeting
p41
aVinto the Great Depression
p42
aVand policy makers were  struggling to respond.
p43
aVStruggling because they didn't know what was going on.
p44
aVThey didn't have data and statistics.
p45
aVSo what Kuznet's report gave them
p46
aVwas reliable data on what  the U.S. economy
p47
aVwas producing,
p48
aVupdated year by year.
p49
aVAnd armed with this information,
p50
aVpolicy makers were, eventually,
p51
aVable to find a way out  of the slump.
p52
aVAnd because Kuznets' invention
p53
aVwas found to be so useful,
p54
aVit spread around the world.
p55
aVAnd now today, every country
p56
aVproduces GDP statistics.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut, in that first report,
p59
aVKuznets himself delivered a warning.
p60
aVIt's in the introductory chapter.
p61
aVOn page seven he says,
p62
aV"The welfare of a nation can, therefore,
p63
aVscarcely be inferred
p64
aVfrom a measurement of  national income
p65
aVas defined above."
p66
aVIt's not the greatest sound  bite in the world,
p67
aVand it's dressed up in the cautious  language of the economist.
p68
aVBut his message was clear:
p69
aVGDP is a tool
p70
aVto help us measure economic performance.
p71
aVIt's not a measure of our well-being.
p72
aVAnd it shouldn't be a guide  to all decision making.
p73
aa(lp74
VBut we have ignored Kuznets' warning.
p75
aVWe live in a world where
p76
aVGDP is the benchmark of success
p77
aVin a global economy.
p78
aVOur politicians boast when GDP goes up.
p79
aVMarkets move
p80
aVand trillions of dollars of capital
p81
aVmove around the world
p82
aVbased on which countries are going up
p83
aVand which countries  are going down,
p84
aVall measured in GDP.
p85
aVOur societies have become
p86
aVengines to create more GDP.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut we know that GDP is flawed.
p89
aVIt ignores the environment.
p90
aVIt counts bombs and prisons as progress.
p91
aVIt can't count happiness or community.
p92
aVAnd it has nothing to say  about fairness or justice.
p93
aVIs it any surprise that our world,
p94
aVmarching to the drumbeat of GDP,
p95
aVis teetering on the brink of environmental disaster
p96
aVand filled with anger and conflict?
p97
aa(lp98
VWe need a better way to measure our societies,
p99
aVa measure based on the real  things that matter to real people.
p100
aVDo I have enough to eat?
p101
aVCan I read and write?
p102
aVAm I safe?
p103
aVDo I have rights?
p104
aVDo I live in a society where I'm not discriminated against?
p105
aVIs my future and the future of my children  prevented from environmental destruction?
p106
aVThese are questions that GDP
p107
aVdoes not and cannot answer.
p108
aa(lp109
VThere have, of course,
p110
aVbeen efforts in the past
p111
aVto move beyond GDP.
p112
aVBut I believe that we're living
p113
aVin a moment when we
p114
aVare ready for a measurement revolution.
p115
aVWe're ready because we've seen,
p116
aVin the financial crisis of 2008,
p117
aVhow our fetish for economic growth
p118
aVled us so far astray.
p119
aVWe've seen, in the Arab Spring,
p120
aVhow countries like Tunisia
p121
aVwere supposedly economic superstars,
p122
aVbut they were societies
p123
aVthat were seething with discontentment.
p124
aVWe're ready, because today we have the technology
p125
aVto gather and analyze data
p126
aVin ways that would have been unimaginable to Kuznets.
p127
aa(lp128
VToday, I'd like to introduce you  to the Social Progress Index.
p129
aVIt's a measure of the  well-being of society,
p130
aVcompletely separate from GDP.
p131
aVIt's a whole new way of looking at the world.
p132
aVThe Social Progress Index
p133
aVbegins by defining what it
p134
aVmeans to be a good society
p135
aVbased around three dimensions.
p136
aVThe first is, does everyone have the basic needs for survival:
p137
aVfood, water, shelter, safety?
p138
aVSecondly, does everyone have
p139
aVaccess to the building blocks  to improve their lives:
p140
aVeducation, information, health and sustainable environment?
p141
aVAnd then third, does every  individual have access
p142
aVto a chance to pursue their goals
p143
aVand dreams and ambitions
p144
aVfree from obstacles?
p145
aVDo they have rights,
p146
aVfreedom of choice,
p147
aVfreedom from discrimination
p148
aVand access to the the world's most advanced knowledge?
p149
aVTogether, these 12 components
p150
aVform the Social Progress framework.
p151
aVAnd for each of these 12 components,
p152
aVwe have indicators to measure  how countries are performing.
p153
aVNot indicators of effort or intention,
p154
aVbut real achievement.
p155
aVWe don't measure how much a country spends on healthcare,
p156
aVwe measure the length and  quality of people's lives.
p157
aVWe don't measure whether governments pass laws against discrimination,
p158
aVwe measure whether people  experience discrimination.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut what you want to know
p161
aVis who's top, don't you? (Laughter)
p162
aVI knew that, I knew that, I knew that.
p163
aVOkay, I'm going to show you.
p164
aVI'm going to show you on this chart.
p165
aVSo here we are,
p166
aVwhat I've done here is put on the  vertical axis social progress.
p167
aVHigher is better.
p168
aVAnd then, just for comparison,
p169
aVjust for fun,
p170
aVon the horizontal axis is GDP per capita.
p171
aVFurther to the right is more.
p172
aVSo the country in the world
p173
aVwith the highest social progress,
p174
aVthe number one country on social progress
p175
aVis New Zealand.
p176
aV(Applause)
p177
aVWell done! Never been; must go.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aVThe country with the least social progress,
p180
aVI'm sorry to say, is Chad.
p181
aVI've never been; maybe next year.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVOr maybe the year after.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow, I know what you're thinking.
p186
aVYou're thinking, "Aha,
p187
aVbut New Zealand has a higher GDP
p188
aVthan Chad!"
p189
aVIt's a good point, well made.
p190
aVBut let me show you
p191
aVtwo other countries.
p192
aVHere's the United States \u2014
p193
aVconsiderably richer than New Zealand,
p194
aVbut with a lower level of social progress.
p195
aVAnd then here's Senegal \u2014
p196
aVit's got a higher level of  social progress than Chad,
p197
aVbut the same level of GDP.
p198
aVSo what's going on? Well, look.
p199
aVLet me bring in the rest of  the countries of the world,
p200
aVthe 132 we've been able to measure,
p201
aVeach one represented by a dot.
p202
aVThere we go. Lots of dots.
p203
aVNow, obviously I can't do all of them,
p204
aVso a few highlights for you:
p205
aVThe highest ranked G7 country is Canada.
p206
aVMy country, the United Kingdom,
p207
aVis sort of middling, sort of dull,
p208
aVbut who cares \u2014
p209
aVat least we beat the French.
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVAnd then looking at the  emerging economies,
p212
aVtop of the BRICS,  pleased to say, is Brazil.
p213
aV(Applause)
p214
aVCome on, cheer!
p215
aVGo, Brazil!
p216
aVBeating South Africa,
p217
aVthen Russia,
p218
aVthen China
p219
aVand then India.
p220
aVTucked away on the right-hand side,
p221
aVyou will see a dot of a  country with a lot of GDP
p222
aVbut not a huge amount  of social progress \u2014
p223
aVthat's Kuwait.
p224
aVJust above Brazil
p225
aVis a social progress superpower \u2014
p226
aVthat's Costa Rica.
p227
aVIt's got a level of social progress the same  as some Western European countries,
p228
aVwith a much lower GDP.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow, my slide is getting  a little cluttered
p231
aVand I'd like to step back a bit.
p232
aVSo let me take away these countries,
p233
aVand then pop in the regression line.
p234
aVSo this shows the average relationship
p235
aVbetween GDP and social progress.
p236
aVThe first thing to notice,
p237
aVis that there's lots of noise
p238
aVaround the trend line.
p239
aVAnd what this shows,
p240
aVwhat this empirically demonstrates,
p241
aVis that GDP is not destiny.
p242
aVAt every level of GDP per capita,
p243
aVthere are opportunities for more social progress,
p244
aVrisks of less.
p245
aVThe second thing to notice
p246
aVis that for poor countries,
p247
aVthe curve is really steep.
p248
aVSo what this tells us is that
p249
aVif poor countries can get
p250
aVa little bit of extra GDP,
p251
aVand if they reinvest that
p252
aVin doctors, nurses, water supplies,
p253
aVsanitation, etc.,
p254
aVthere's a lot of social progress bang
p255
aVfor your GDP buck.
p256
aVAnd that's good news, and that's what  we've seen over the last 20, 30 years,
p257
aVwith a lot of people lifted out of poverty
p258
aVby economic growth and good policies
p259
aVin poorer countries.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut go on a bit further up the curve,
p262
aVand then we see it flattening out.
p263
aVEach extra dollar of GDP
p264
aVis buying less and less social progress.
p265
aVAnd with more and more of the world's population
p266
aVliving on this part of the curve,
p267
aVit means GDP is becoming
p268
aVless and less useful
p269
aVas a guide to our development.
p270
aVI'll show you an example of Brazil.
p271
aa(lp272
VHere's Brazil:
p273
aVsocial progress of about 70 out of 100,
p274
aVGDP per capita about  14,000 dollars a year.
p275
aVAnd look, Brazil's above the line.
p276
aVBrazil is doing a reasonably good job
p277
aVof turning GDP into social progress.
p278
aVBut where does Brazil go next?
p279
aVLet's say that Brazil
p280
aVadopts a bold economic plan
p281
aVto double GDP in the next decade.
p282
aVBut that is only half a plan.
p283
aVIt's less than half a plan,
p284
aVbecause where does Brazil want to go on social progress?
p285
aVBrazil, it's possible
p286
aVto increase your growth,
p287
aVincrease your GDP,
p288
aVwhile stagnating or going backwards
p289
aVon social progress.
p290
aVWe don't want Brazil
p291
aVto become like Russia.
p292
aVWhat you really want is for Brazil
p293
aVto get ever more efficient at creating  social progress from its GDP,
p294
aVso it becomes more like New Zealand.
p295
aVAnd what that means is that
p296
aVBrazil needs to prioritize social progress
p297
aVin its development plan
p298
aVand see that it's not just growth alone,
p299
aVit's growth with social progress.
p300
aVAnd that's what the Social  Progress Index does:
p301
aVIt reframes the debate about development,
p302
aVnot just about GDP alone,
p303
aVbut inclusive, sustainable growth
p304
aVthat brings real improvements  in people's lives.
p305
aVAnd it's not just about countries.
p306
aa(lp307
VEarlier this year,
p308
aVwith our friends from the Imazon  nonprofit here in Brazil,
p309
aVwe launched the first subnational  Social Progress Index.
p310
aVWe did it for the Amazon region.
p311
aVIt's an area the size of  Europe, 24 million people,
p312
aVone of the most deprived  parts of the country.
p313
aVAnd here are the results,
p314
aVand this is broken down
p315
aVinto nearly 800 different municipalities.
p316
aVAnd with this detailed information
p317
aVabout the real quality of life
p318
aVin this part of the country,
p319
aVImazon and other partners
p320
aVfrom government,  business and civil society
p321
aVcan work together to construct
p322
aVa development plan
p323
aVthat will help really improve people's lives,
p324
aVwhile protecting that  precious global asset
p325
aVthat is the Amazon Rainforest.
p326
aVAnd this is just the beginning,
p327
aVYou can create a Social Progress Index
p328
aVfor any state, region,  city or municipality.
p329
aVWe all know and love TEDx;
p330
aVthis is Social Pogress-x.
p331
aVThis is a tool for anyone to come and use.
p332
aa(lp333
VContrary to the way we  sometimes talk about it,
p334
aVGDP was not handed down from  God on tablets of stone. (Laughter)
p335
aVIt's a measurement tool invented in the 20th century
p336
aVto address the challenges of the 20th century.
p337
aVIn the 21st century,
p338
aVwe face new challenges:
p339
aVaging, obesity, climate change, and so on.
p340
aVTo face those challenges,
p341
aVwe need new tools of measurement,
p342
aVnew ways of valuing progress.
p343
aa(lp344
VImagine if we could measure
p345
aVwhat nonprofits, charities,
p346
aVvolunteers, civil society organizations
p347
aVreally contribute to our society.
p348
aVImagine if businesses competed
p349
aVnot just on the basis of their economic contribution,
p350
aVbut on their contribution  to social progress.
p351
aVImagine if we could hold  politicians to account
p352
aVfor really improving people's lives.
p353
aVImagine if we could work together \u2014
p354
aVgovernment, business,  civil society, me, you \u2014
p355
aVand make this century the  century of social progress.
p356
aVThank you.

model for social change built on partnerships between wealthy businesses, governments and community organizations. Shortly thereafter, Bishop floated the idea of a &ldquo;Social Competiveness Index,&rdquo; the idea that one day countries would compete with one another to be the most socially advanced, in the same way as they now compete to be economic top dog. Green loved it and decided to turn it into reality. </p><p>Teaming up with Avina&#39;s president Brizio Biondi-Morra, Sally Osberg of the Skoll Foundation and many other thought leaders from businesses and foundations, he began work on what would become the Social Progress Imperative, of which he&#39;s now CEO.

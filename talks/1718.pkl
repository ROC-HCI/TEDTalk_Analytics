VWe always hear that texting is a scourge.
p5
aVThe idea is that texting spells the decline and fall
p6
aVof any kind of serious literacy, or at least writing ability,
p7
aVamong young people in the United States
p8
aVand now the whole world today.
p9
aVThe fact of the matter is that it just isn't true,
p10
aVand it's easy to think that it is true,
p11
aVbut in order to see it in another way,
p12
aVin order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing,
p13
aVnot just energetic, but a miraculous thing,
p14
aVa kind of emergent complexity
p15
aVthat we're seeing happening right now,
p16
aVwe have to pull the camera back for a bit
p17
aVand look at what language really is,
p18
aVin which case, one thing that we see
p19
aVis that texting is not writing at all.
p20
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p21
aa(lp22
VBasically, if we think about language,
p23
aVlanguage has existed for perhaps 150,000 years,
p24
aVat least 80,000 years,
p25
aVand what it arose as is speech. People talked.
p26
aVThat's what we're probably genetically specified for.
p27
aVThat's how we use language most.
p28
aVWriting is something that came along much later,
p29
aVand as we saw in the last talk,
p30
aVthere's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened,
p31
aVbut according to traditional estimates,
p32
aVif humanity had existed for 24 hours,
p33
aVthen writing only came along at about 11:07 p.m.
p34
aVThat's how much of a latterly thing writing is.
p35
aVSo first there's speech, and then writing comes along
p36
aVas a kind of artifice.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow don't get me wrong, writing has certain advantages.
p39
aVWhen you write, because it's a conscious process,
p40
aVbecause you can look backwards,
p41
aVyou can do things with language that are much less likely
p42
aVif you're just talking.
p43
aVFor example, imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's
p44
aV"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:"
p45
aa(lp46
V"The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours,
p47
aVtill the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed
p48
aVinto a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example
p49
aVwas given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself."
p50
aa(lp51
VThat's beautiful, but let's face it, nobody talks that way.
p52
aVOr at least, they shouldn't if they're interested
p53
aVin reproducing. That \u2014
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVis not the way any human being speaks casually.
p56
aa(lp57
VCasual speech is something quite different.
p58
aVLinguists have actually shown
p59
aVthat when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way,
p60
aVwe tend to speak in word packets of maybe
p61
aVseven to 10 words.
p62
aVYou'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record
p63
aVyourself or a group of people talking.
p64
aVThat's what speech is like.
p65
aVSpeech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.
p66
aVIt's much less reflective \u2014 very different from writing.
p67
aVSo we naturally tend to think, because we see language
p68
aVwritten so often, that that's what language is,
p69
aVbut actually what language is, is speech. They are two things.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow of course, as history has gone by,
p72
aVit's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed
p73
aVbetween speech and writing.
p74
aVSo, for example, in a distant era now,
p75
aVit was common when one gave a speech
p76
aVto basically talk like writing.
p77
aVSo I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving
p78
aVin an old movie where they clear their throat, and they go,
p79
aV"Ahem, ladies and gentlemen," and then they speak
p80
aVin a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech.
p81
aVIt's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one.
p82
aVIt's basically talking like you write, and so, for example,
p83
aVwe're thinking so much these days about Lincoln
p84
aVbecause of the movie.
p85
aVThe Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event.
p86
aVFor two hours before that, Edward Everett spoke
p87
aVon a topic that, frankly, cannot engage us today
p88
aVand barely did then.
p89
aVThe point of it was to listen to him
p90
aVspeaking like writing.
p91
aVOrdinary people stood and listened to that for two hours.
p92
aVIt was perfectly natural.
p93
aVThat's what people did then, speaking like writing.
p94
aa(lp95
VWell, if you can speak like writing,
p96
aVthen logically it follows that you might want to also
p97
aVsometimes write like you speak.
p98
aVThe problem was just that in the material,
p99
aVmechanical sense, that was harder back in the day
p100
aVfor the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it.
p101
aVIt's almost impossible to do that with your hand
p102
aVexcept in shorthand, and then communication is limited.
p103
aVOn a manual typewriter it was very difficult,
p104
aVand even when we had electric typewriters,
p105
aVor then computer keyboards, the fact is
p106
aVthat even if you can type easily enough to keep up
p107
aVwith the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have
p108
aVsomebody who can receive your message quickly.
p109
aa(lp110
VOnce you have things in your pocket that can receive that message,
p111
aVthen you have the conditions that allow
p112
aVthat we can write like we speak.
p113
aVAnd that's where texting comes in.
p114
aVAnd so, texting is very loose in its structure.
p115
aVNo one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts,
p116
aVbut then again, do you think about those things when you talk?
p117
aVNo, and so therefore why would you when you were texting?
p118
aa(lp119
VWhat texting is, despite the fact that it involves
p120
aVthe brute mechanics of something that we call writing,
p121
aVis fingered speech. That's what texting is.
p122
aVNow we can write the way we talk.
p123
aVAnd it's a very interesting thing, but nevertheless
p124
aVeasy to think that still it represents some sort of decline.
p125
aVWe see this general bagginess of the structure,
p126
aVthe lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to
p127
aVlearning on the blackboard, and so we think
p128
aVthat something has gone wrong.
p129
aVIt's a very natural sense.
p130
aa(lp131
VBut the fact of the matter is that what is going on
p132
aVis a kind of emergent complexity.
p133
aVThat's what we're seeing in this fingered speech.
p134
aVAnd in order to understand it, what we want to see
p135
aVis the way, in this new kind of language,
p136
aVthere is new structure coming up.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd so, for example, there is in texting a convention,
p139
aVwhich is LOL.
p140
aVNow LOL, we generally think of
p141
aVas meaning "laughing out loud."
p142
aVAnd of course, theoretically, it does,
p143
aVand if you look at older texts, then people used it
p144
aVto actually indicate laughing out loud.
p145
aVBut if you text now, or if you are someone who
p146
aVis aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become,
p147
aVyou'll notice that LOL
p148
aVdoes not mean laughing out loud anymore.
p149
aVIt's evolved into something that is much subtler.
p150
aa(lp151
VThis is an actual text that was done
p152
aVby a non-male person of about 20 years old
p153
aVnot too long ago.
p154
aa(lp155
V"I love the font you're using, btw."
p156
aa(lp157
VJulie: "lol thanks gmail is being slow right now"
p158
aa(lp159
VNow if you think about it, that's not funny.
p160
aVNo one's laughing. (Laughter)
p161
aVAnd yet, there it is, so you assume
p162
aVthere's been some kind of hiccup.
p163
aa(lp164
VThen Susan says "lol, I know,"
p165
aVagain more guffawing than we're used to
p166
aVwhen you're talking about these inconveniences.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo Julie says, "I just sent you an email."
p169
aa(lp170
VSusan: "lol, I see it."
p171
aa(lp172
VVery funny people, if that's what LOL means.
p173
aa(lp174
VThis Julie says, "So what's up?"
p175
aa(lp176
VSusan: "lol, I have to write a 10 page paper."
p177
aa(lp178
VShe's not amused. Let's think about it.
p179
aVLOL is being used in a very particular way.
p180
aVIt's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation.
p181
aVWe linguists call things like that pragmatic particles.
p182
aVAny spoken language that's used by real people has them.
p183
aVIf you happen to speak Japanese, think about
p184
aVthat little word "ne" that you use at the end of a lot of sentences.
p185
aVIf you listen to the way black youth today speak,
p186
aVthink about the use of the word "yo."
p187
aVWhole dissertations could be written about it,
p188
aVand probably are being written about it.
p189
aVA pragmatic particle, that's what LOL has gradually become.
p190
aVIt's a way of using the language between actual people.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnother example is "slash."
p193
aVNow, we can use slash in the way that we're used to,
p194
aValong the lines of, "We're going to have
p195
aVa party-slash-networking session."
p196
aVThat's kind of like what we're at.
p197
aVSlash is used in a very different way
p198
aVin texting among young people today.
p199
aVIt's used to change the scene.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo for example, this Sally person says,
p202
aV"So I need to find people to chill with"
p203
aVand Jake says, "Haha" \u2014
p204
aVyou could write a dissertation about "Haha" too, but we don't have time for that \u2014
p205
aV"Haha so you're going by yourself? Why?"
p206
aa(lp207
VSally: "For this summer program at NYU."
p208
aa(lp209
VJake: "Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players
p210
aVtrying to shoot with one eye."
p211
aa(lp212
VThe slash is interesting.
p213
aVI don't really even know what Jake is talking about after that,
p214
aVbut you notice that he's changing the topic.
p215
aVNow that seems kind of mundane,
p216
aVbut think about how in real life,
p217
aVif we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic,
p218
aVthere are ways of doing it gracefully.
p219
aVYou don't just zip right into it.
p220
aVYou'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance,
p221
aVor you'll say something like, "Hmm, makes you think \u2014"
p222
aVwhen it really didn't, but what you're really \u2014
p223
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p224
aVwhat you're really trying to do is change the topic.
p225
aVYou can't do that while you're texting,
p226
aVand so ways are developing of doing it within this medium.
p227
aVAll spoken languages have what a linguist calls
p228
aVa new information marker \u2014 or two, or three.
p229
aVTexting has developed one from this slash.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo we have a whole battery of new constructions
p232
aVthat are developing, and yet it's easy to think,
p233
aVwell, something is still wrong.
p234
aVThere's a lack of structure of some sort.
p235
aVIt's not as sophisticated
p236
aVas the language of The Wall Street Journal.
p237
aVWell, the fact of the matter is,
p238
aVlook at this person in 1956,
p239
aVand this is when texting doesn't exist,
p240
aV"I Love Lucy" is still on the air.
p241
aa(lp242
V"Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table,
p243
aVcannot write grammatically \u2014 "
p244
aa(lp245
VWe've heard that sort of thing before,
p246
aVnot just in 1956. 1917, Connecticut schoolteacher.
p247
aV1917. This is the time when we all assume
p248
aVthat everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect
p249
aVbecause the people on "Downton Abbey" are articulate,
p250
aVor something like that.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo, "From every college in the country goes up the cry,
p253
aV'Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate.'"
p254
aa(lp255
VAnd so on. You can go even further back than this.
p256
aVIt's the President of Harvard. It's 1871.
p257
aVThere's no electricity. People have three names.
p258
aa(lp259
V"Bad spelling,
p260
aVincorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing."
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd he's talking about people who are otherwise
p263
aVwell prepared for college studies.
p264
aa(lp265
VYou can go even further back.
p266
aV1841, some long-lost superintendent of schools is upset
p267
aVbecause of what he has for a long time "noted with regret
p268
aVthe almost entire neglect of the original" blah blah blah blah blah.
p269
aa(lp270
VOr you can go all the way back to 63 A.D. \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p271
aVand there's this poor man who doesn't like the way
p272
aVpeople are speaking Latin.
p273
aVAs it happens, he was writing about what had become French.
p274
aVAnd so, there are always \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p275
aVthere are always people worrying about these things
p276
aVand the planet somehow seems to keep spinning.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd so, the way I'm thinking of texting these days is
p279
aVthat what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing
p280
aVthat young people are developing,
p281
aVwhich they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills,
p282
aVand that means that they're able to do two things.
p283
aVIncreasing evidence is that being bilingual
p284
aVis cognitively beneficial.
p285
aVThat's also true of being bidialectal.
p286
aVThat's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing.
p287
aVAnd so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act
p288
aVthat young people are using today, not consciously, of course,
p289
aVbut it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire.
p290
aVIt's very simple.
p291
aVIf somebody from 1973 looked at
p292
aVwhat was on a dormitory message board in 1993,
p293
aVthe slang would have changed a little bit
p294
aVsince the era of "Love Story,"
p295
aVbut they would understand what was on that message board.
p296
aVTake that person from 1993 \u2014 not that long ago,
p297
aVthis is "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" \u2014 those people.
p298
aVTake those people and they read
p299
aVa very typical text written by a 20-year-old today.
p300
aVOften they would have no idea what half of it meant
p301
aVbecause a whole new language has developed
p302
aVamong our young people doing something as mundane
p303
aVas what it looks like to us when they're batting around
p304
aVon their little devices.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo in closing, if I could go into the future,
p307
aVif I could go into 2033,
p308
aVthe first thing I would ask is whether David Simon
p309
aVhad done a sequel to "The Wire." I would want to know.
p310
aVAnd \u2014 I really would ask that \u2014
p311
aVand then I'd want to know actually what was going on on "Downton Abbey."
p312
aVThat'd be the second thing.
p313
aVAnd then the third thing would be,
p314
aVplease show me a sheaf of texts
p315
aVwritten by 16-year-old girls,
p316
aVbecause I would want to know where this language
p317
aVhad developed since our times,
p318
aVand ideally I would then send them back to you and me now
p319
aVso we could examine this linguistic miracle
p320
aVhappening right under our noses.
p321
aVThank you very much.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Applause)
p324
aVThank you. (Applause)

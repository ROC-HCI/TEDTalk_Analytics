VBecause of what I'm about to say,
p5
aVI really should establish my green credentials.
p6
aVWhen I was a small boy, I took my pledge
p7
aVas an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste
p8
aVthe natural resources of my country,
p9
aVits air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.
p10
aVAnd I've stuck to that.
p11
aVStanford, I majored in ecology and evolution.
p12
aV1968, I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was "mister natural" for a while.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd then worked for the Jerry Brown administration.
p15
aVThe Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends,
p16
aVbasically leveled the energy efficiency of California,
p17
aVso it's the same now, 30 years later,
p18
aVeven though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.
p19
aVAnd we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.
p20
aVCalifornia is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.
p21
aa(lp22
VThis year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today,
p23
aVcalled Whole Earth Discipline.
p24
aVThe dominant demographic event of our time
p25
aVis this screamingly rapid urbanization
p26
aVthat we have going on.
p27
aVBy mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban,
p28
aVand that's mostly in the developing world,
p29
aVwhere that's happening.
p30
aVIt's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree
p31
aVby the size of cities.
p32
aVThe developing world now has all of the biggest cities,
p33
aVand they are developing three times faster than the developed countries,
p34
aVand nine times bigger.
p35
aVIt's qualitatively different.
p36
aVThey are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.
p37
aa(lp38
V1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.
p39
aVWell we now have a distribution of urban power
p40
aVsimilar to what we had 1,000 years ago.
p41
aVIn other words, the rise of the West,
p42
aVdramatic as it was, is over.
p43
aVThe aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming:
p44
aV1.3 million people a week coming to town,
p45
aVdecade after decade.
p46
aVWhat's really going on?
p47
aVWell, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.
p48
aVSubsistence farming is drying up basically.
p49
aa(lp50
VPeople are following opportunity into town.
p51
aVAnd this is why.
p52
aVI used to have a very romantic idea about villages,
p53
aVand it's because I never lived in one.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVBecause in town \u2014
p56
aVthis is the bustling squatter city
p57
aVof Kibera, near Nairobi \u2014
p58
aVthey see action. They see opportunity.
p59
aVThey see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in
p60
aVback in the subsistence farm.
p61
aa(lp62
VAs you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics.
p63
aVThere is plenty going on.
p64
aVThey are poor, but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative.
p65
aVThe aggregate numbers now
p66
aVare that basically squatters,
p67
aVall one billion of them, are building the urban world,
p68
aVwhich means they're building the world \u2014
p69
aVpersonally, one by one, family by family,
p70
aVclan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood.
p71
aVThey start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by.
p72
aVThey even build their own infrastructure.
p73
aVWell, steal their own infrastructure, at first.
p74
aVCable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.
p75
aVAnd then gradually gentrifies.
p76
aa(lp77
VIt is not the case that slums undermine prosperity,
p78
aVnot the working slums; they help create prosperity.
p79
aVSo in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums,
p80
aVit's 1/6th of the GDP of India.
p81
aVSocial capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.
p82
aVThese people are valuable as a group.
p83
aVAnd that's how they work.
p84
aa(lp85
VThere is a lot of people who think about all these poor people,
p86
aV"Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing."
p87
aVIt used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service."
p88
aVNow they're showing us how they do their phone service.
p89
aVFamine mostly is a rural event now.
p90
aVThere are things they care about.
p91
aVAnd this is where we can help.
p92
aVAnd the nations they're in can help.
p93
aVAnd they are helping each other solve these issues.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai.
p96
aVYou look at that lane on the right.
p97
aVAnd you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?"
p98
aVThe answer is, "Everything."
p99
aVThis is better than a mall. It's much denser.
p100
aVIt's much more interactive.
p101
aVAnd the scale is terrific.
p102
aVThe main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.
p103
aVThese are people busy getting out of poverty
p104
aVjust as fast as they can.
p105
aVThey're helping each other do it.
p106
aVThey're doing it through an outlaw thing,
p107
aVthe informal economy.
p108
aVThe informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:
p109
aVit's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.
p110
aVWe don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.
p111
aa(lp112
VFurthermore, people in the informal economy,
p113
aVthe gray economy \u2014
p114
aVas time goes by,
p115
aVcrime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world,
p116
aVor they can join the legitimate world.
p117
aVWe should be able to make that choice
p118
aVeasier for them to get toward the legitimate world,
p119
aVbecause if we don't, they will go toward the criminal world.
p120
aVThere's all kinds of activity.
p121
aa(lp122
VIn Dharavi the slum performs not only
p123
aVa lot of services for itself,
p124
aVbut it performs services for the city at large.
p125
aVAnd one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.
p126
aVParents pool their money to hire some local teachers
p127
aVto a private, tiny, unofficial school.
p128
aVEducation is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world.
p129
aVSo you see some interesting, typical, urban things.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo one thing slammed up against another,
p132
aVsuch as in Sao Paulo here.
p133
aVThat's what cities do. That's how they create value,
p134
aVis by slamming things together.
p135
aVIn this case, supply right next to demand.
p136
aVSo the maids and the gardeners and the guards
p137
aVthat live in this lively part of town on the left
p138
aVwalk to work, in the boring, rich neighborhood.
p139
aa(lp140
VProximity is amazing.
p141
aVWe are learning about how dense proximity can be.
p142
aVConnectivity between the city and the country
p143
aVis what's going to keep the country good,
p144
aVbecause the city has interesting ways of doing things.
p145
aVThis is what makes cities \u2014
p146
aV(Applause)
p147
aVthis is what makes cities so green in the developing world.
p148
aa(lp149
VBecause people leave the poverty trap, an ecological disaster
p150
aVof subsistence farms, and head to town.
p151
aVAnd when they're gone the natural environment
p152
aVstarts to come back very rapidly.
p153
aVAnd those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops
p154
aVto send food to the new growing markets in town.
p155
aVSo if you want to save a village, you do it with a good road,
p156
aVor with a good cell phone connection, and ideally some grid electrical power.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo the event is: we're a city planet. That just happened.
p159
aVMore than half.
p160
aVThe numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now.
p161
aVAnother billion is expected.
p162
aVThat's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way.
p163
aVAnd that will determine a lot of how we function.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, for us environmentalists,
p166
aVmaybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb.
p167
aVPeople get into town.
p168
aVThe immediately have fewer children.
p169
aVThey don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of
p170
aVcoming up in the world means they will have fewer, higher-quality kids,
p171
aVand the birthrate goes down radically.
p172
aa(lp173
VVery interesting side effect here,
p174
aVhere's a slide from Phillip Longman.
p175
aVShows what is happening.
p176
aVAs we have more and more old people, like me,
p177
aVand fewer and fewer babies.
p178
aVAnd they are regionally separated.
p179
aVWhat you're getting is a world which is
p180
aVold folks, and old cities, going around doing things the old way,
p181
aVin the north.
p182
aVAnd young people in brand new cities they're inventing,
p183
aVdoing new things, in the south.
p184
aVWhere do you think the action is going to be?
p185
aa(lp186
VShift of subject. Quickly drop by climate.
p187
aVThe climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse
p188
aVthan we think, faster than we think.
p189
aVClimate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system,
p190
aVfull of runaway positive feedbacks,
p191
aVhidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points.
p192
aVHere's just a few samples.
p193
aVWe're going to keep being surprised. And almost all
p194
aVthe surprises are going to be bad ones.
p195
aa(lp196
VFrom your standpoint this means
p197
aVa great increase in climate refugees
p198
aVover the coming decades,
p199
aVand what goes along with that, which is resource wars
p200
aVand chaos wars,
p201
aVas we're seeing in Darfur.
p202
aVThat's what drought does.
p203
aVIt brings carrying capacity down,
p204
aVand there's not enough carrying capacity
p205
aVto support the people. And then you're in trouble.
p206
aa(lp207
VShift to the power situation.
p208
aVBaseload electricity is what it takes to run a city,
p209
aVor a city planet.
p210
aVSo far there is only three sources of baseload electricity:
p211
aVcoal, some gas,
p212
aVnuclear and hydro.
p213
aVOf those, only nuclear and hydro are green.
p214
aVCoal is what is causing the climate problems.
p215
aVAnd everyone will keep burning it
p216
aVbecause it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.
p217
aVWind and solar can't help, because so far we don't have a way to store that energy.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo with hydro maxed out,
p220
aVcoal and lose the climate,
p221
aVor nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source,
p222
aVand maybe save the climate.
p223
aVAnd if we can eventually get good solar in space,
p224
aVthat also could help.
p225
aVBecause remember, this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world
p226
aVin the villages and in the cities.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo, between coal and nuclear,
p229
aVcompare their waste products.
p230
aVIf all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear,
p231
aVthe amount of waste that would be added up
p232
aVwould fit in a Coke can.
p233
aVWhereas a coal-burning plant,
p234
aVa normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,
p235
aVeach car having 100 tons.
p236
aVAnd it puts 18 thousand tons
p237
aVof carbon dioxide in the air.
p238
aVSo and then when you compare the lifetime emissions
p239
aVof these various energy forms,
p240
aVnuclear is about even with solar and wind,
p241
aVand ahead of solar \u2014
p242
aVoh, I'm sorry \u2014 with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd does nuclear really compete with coal?
p245
aVJust ask the coal miners in Australia.
p246
aVThat's where you see some of the source,
p247
aVnot from my fellow environmentalists,
p248
aVbut from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.
p249
aVWell the good news is that
p250
aVthe developing world, but frankly, the whole world,
p251
aVis busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors.
p252
aVThis is good for the atmosphere.
p253
aVIt's good for their prosperity.
p254
aa(lp255
VI want to point out one interesting thing,
p256
aVwhich is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.
p257
aVIt's supposed to be, I don't know, local solar and wind and cogeneration,
p258
aVand good things like that.
p259
aVBut frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on,
p260
aVmight serve even better.
p261
aa(lp262
VThe Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors,
p263
aVfor their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.
p264
aVAnd they're selling these floating reactors,
p265
aVonly 35 megawatts, to developing countries.
p266
aVHere's the design of an early one from Toshiba.
p267
aVIt's interesting, say, to take a 25-megawatt,
p268
aV25 million watts,
p269
aVand you compare it to the standard big iron
p270
aVof an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva,
p271
aVwhich is 1.2, 1.6 billion watts.
p272
aVThese things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable.
p273
aVHere's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.
p274
aVHere's another American design that came out
p275
aVof Los Alamos, and is now commercial.
p276
aa(lp277
VAlmost all of these are not only small, they are proliferation-proof.
p278
aVThey're typically buried in the ground.
p279
aVAnd the innovation is moving very rapidly.
p280
aVSo I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.
p281
aVIn terms of proliferation,
p282
aVnuclear energy has done more
p283
aVto dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.
p284
aVAnd that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room,
p285
aV20 percent of electricity
p286
aVin this room is probably nuclear.
p287
aVHalf of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,
p288
aVsoon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.
p289
aVAnd so I would like to see the GNEP program,
p290
aVthat was developed in the Bush administration, go forward aggressively.
p291
aVAnd I was glad to see that president Obama
p292
aVsupported the nuclear fuel bank strategy
p293
aVwhen he spoke in Prague the other week.
p294
aa(lp295
VOne more subject. Genetically engineered food crops,
p296
aVin my view, as a biologist,
p297
aVhave no reason to be controversial.
p298
aVMy fellow environmentalists, on this subject,
p299
aVhave been irrational, anti-scientific, and very harmful.
p300
aVDespite their best efforts,
p301
aVgenetically engineered crops are the most
p302
aVrapidly successful agricultural innovation in history.
p303
aVThey're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming,
p304
aVwhich leaves the soil in place,
p305
aVgetting healthier from year to year \u2014
p306
aVslso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil
p307
aVinto the atmosphere.
p308
aVThey reduce pesticide use.
p309
aVAnd they increase yield, which allows you to have your
p310
aVagricultural area be smaller,
p311
aVand therefore more wild area is freed up.
p312
aa(lp313
VBy the way, this map from 2006
p314
aVis out of date because it shows Africa
p315
aVstill under the thumb of Greenpeace,
p316
aVand Friends of the Earth from Europe,
p317
aVand they're finally getting out from under that.
p318
aVAnd biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last.
p319
aa(lp320
VThis is a moral issue.
p321
aVThe Nuffield Council on Bioethics
p322
aVmet on this issue twice in great detail
p323
aVand said it is a moral imperative
p324
aVto make genetically engineered crops readily available.
p325
aVSpeaking of imperatives, geoengineering is taboo now,
p326
aVespecially in government circles,
p327
aVthough I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago,
p328
aVbut it will be on your plate \u2014
p329
aVnot this year but pretty soon,
p330
aVbecause some harsh realizations are coming along.
p331
aVThis is a list of them.
p332
aa(lp333
VBasically the news is going to keep getting more scary.
p334
aVThere will be events,
p335
aVlike 35,000 people dying of a heat wave,
p336
aVwhich happened a while back.
p337
aVLike cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh.
p338
aVLike wars over water,
p339
aVsuch as in the Indus.
p340
aVAnd as those events keep happening
p341
aVwe're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?"
p342
aa(lp343
VBut there's this little problem with geoengineering:
p344
aVwhat body is going to decide
p345
aVwho gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?
p346
aVBecause everybody is downstream,
p347
aVdownwind of whatever is done.
p348
aVAnd if we just taboo it completely
p349
aVwe could lose civilization.
p350
aVBut if we just say "OK,
p351
aVChina, you're worried, you go ahead.
p352
aVYou geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way."
p353
aVThat would be considered an act of war by both nations.
p354
aVSo this is very interesting diplomacy coming along.
p355
aVI should say, it is more practical than people think.
p356
aa(lp357
VHere is an example that climatologists like a lot,
p358
aVone of the dozens of geoengineering ideas.
p359
aVThis one came from the sulfur dioxide
p360
aVfrom Mount Pinatubo in 1991 \u2014
p361
aVcooled the earth by half a degree.
p362
aVThere was so much ice in 1992, the following year,
p363
aVthat there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs
p364
aVwho were known as the Pinatubo cubs.
p365
aVTo put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere
p366
aVwould cost on the order of a billion dollars a year.
p367
aVThat's nothing, compared to all of the other
p368
aVthings we may be trying to do about energy.
p369
aa(lp370
VJust to run by another one:
p371
aVthis is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds,
p372
aVby atomizing seawater;
p373
aVthat would brighten the albedo of the whole planet.
p374
aVA nice one, because it can happen
p375
aVlots of little ways in lots of little places,
p376
aVis by copying the ancient Amazon Indians
p377
aVwho made good agricultural soil
p378
aVby pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste,
p379
aVand biochar fixes large quantities of carbon
p380
aVwhile it's improving the soil.
p381
aa(lp382
VSo here is where we are.
p383
aVNobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen
p384
aVcalls our geological era the Anthropocene,
p385
aVthe human-dominated era. We are stuck
p386
aVwith its obligations.
p387
aVIn the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were,
p388
aV"We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it."
p389
aVThe first words of Whole Earth Discipline
p390
aVare, "We are as Gods, and have to get good at it."
p391
aVThank you.
p392

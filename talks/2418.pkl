VMelati Wijsen: Bali \u2014 island of gods.
p5
aa(lp6
VIsabel Wijsen: A green paradise.
p7
aa(lp8
VMW: Or ...
p9
aVa paradise lost.
p10
aVBali:
p11
aVisland of garbage.
p12
aa(lp13
VIW: In Bali,
p14
aVwe generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day.
p15
aVThat's about a 14-story building.
p16
aVAnd when it comes to plastic bags,
p17
aVless than five percent gets recycled.
p18
aa(lp19
VMW: We know that changes the image you may have of our island.
p20
aVIt changed ours, too, when we learned about it,
p21
aVwhen we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains
p22
aVand then in our rivers
p23
aVand then in our ocean.
p24
aVAnd those that don't even make it to the ocean,
p25
aVthey're either burned or littered.
p26
aa(lp27
VIW: So we decided to do something about it.
p28
aVAnd we've been working for almost three years now
p29
aVto try to say no to plastic bags on our home island.
p30
aVAnd we have had some significant successes.
p31
aa(lp32
VMW: We are sisters,
p33
aVand we go to the best school on earth:
p34
aVGreen School, Bali.
p35
aVGreen School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo,
p36
aVbut also in the way that it teaches.
p37
aVWe are taught to become leaders of today,
p38
aVsomething a normal textbook cannot match.
p39
aa(lp40
VIW: One day we had a lesson in class
p41
aVwhere we learned about significant people,
p42
aVlike Nelson Mandela,
p43
aVLady Diana
p44
aVand Mahatma Gandhi.
p45
aVWalking home that day,
p46
aVwe agreed that we also wanted to be significant.
p47
aVWhy should we wait until we were grown up
p48
aVto be significant?
p49
aVWe wanted to do something now.
p50
aa(lp51
VMW: Sitting on the sofa that night,
p52
aVwe brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali.
p53
aVAnd one thing that stood out to us the most
p54
aVwas the plastic garbage.
p55
aVBut that is a huge problem.
p56
aVSo we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids:
p57
aVplastic bags.
p58
aVAnd the idea was born.
p59
aa(lp60
VIW: We started researching,
p61
aVand let's just say, the more we learned,
p62
aVthere was nothing good about plastic bags.
p63
aVAnd you know what?
p64
aVWe don't even need them.
p65
aa(lp66
VMW: We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags
p67
aVin many other places,
p68
aVfrom Hawaii to Rwanda
p69
aVand to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin.
p70
aa(lp71
VIW: And so the idea turned into the launch of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags."
p72
aVMW: In the years that we have been campaigning,
p73
aVwe have learned a lot.
p74
aa(lp75
VLesson number one:
p76
aVyou cannot do it all by yourself.
p77
aVYou need a big team of like-minded kids,
p78
aVand so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew.
p79
aVThe volunteer team includes children from all over the island,
p80
aVfrom both international and local schools.
p81
aVAnd together with them,
p82
aVwe started a multi-layered approach,
p83
aVbased on an on- and off-line signature petition,
p84
aVeducational and inspirational presentations at schools
p85
aVand we raise general awareness at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups.
p86
aVAnd last but not least,
p87
aVwe distribute alternative bags,
p88
aVbags like net bags,
p89
aVrecycled newspaper bags
p90
aVor 100 percent organic material bags,
p91
aVall made by local initiatives on the island.
p92
aa(lp93
VIW: We run a pilot village,
p94
aVhome of 800 families.
p95
aVThe village mayor was our first friend
p96
aVand he loved our T-shirts, so that helped.
p97
aVWe focused on making the customers aware,
p98
aVbecause that's where the change needs to happen.
p99
aVThe village is already two-thirds along the way
p100
aVof becoming plastic bag free.
p101
aa(lp102
VOur first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed.
p103
aVSo we thought,
p104
aV"Hmm ... a petition with one million signatures.
p105
aVThey can't ignore us, right?"
p106
aa(lp107
VMW: Right!
p108
aa(lp109
VIW: But, who would have guessed
p110
aVone million signatures is, like, a thousand times a thousand?
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VWe got stuck \u2014
p115
aVtill we learned lesson number two:
p116
aVthink outside the box.
p117
aVSomeone mentioned
p118
aVthat the Bali airport handles 16 million arrivals and departures a year.
p119
aa(lp120
VMW: But how do we get into the airport?
p121
aVAnd here comes lesson number three:
p122
aVpersistence.
p123
aVOff we headed to the airport.
p124
aVWe got past the janitor.
p125
aVAnd then it was his boss's boss,
p126
aVand then the assistant office manager,
p127
aVand then the office manager,
p128
aVand then ...
p129
aVwe got shuffled down two levels and thought,
p130
aVwell, here comes the janitor again.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd after several days knocking on doors
p133
aVand just being kids on a mission,
p134
aVwe finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports.
p135
aVAnd we gave him the "Bali of plastic bags" speech, and being a very nice man,
p136
aVhe said, [imitating the man's voice] "I cannot believe what I'm about say,
p137
aVbut I'm going to give authorization
p138
aVto collect signatures behind customs and immigrations."
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
V(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VIW: In our first hour and a half there,
p145
aVwe got almost 1,000 signatures.
p146
aVHow cool is that?
p147
aa(lp148
VLesson number four:
p149
aVyou need champions at all levels of society,
p150
aVfrom students to commercial managers to famous people.
p151
aVAnd thanks to the attraction of Green School,
p152
aVwe had access to a steady stream of celebrities.
p153
aVBan Ki Moon taught us
p154
aVthat Secretary-Generals of the United Nations
p155
aVdon't sign petitions \u2014
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
Veven if kids ask nicely.
p160
aVBut he promised to spread the word,
p161
aVand now we work closely with the United Nations.
p162
aa(lp163
VMW: Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network.
p164
aVShe started with just one Roots & Shoots group
p165
aVand now she has 4,000 groups around the world.
p166
aVWe are one of them.
p167
aVShe's a real inspiration.
p168
aa(lp169
VIf you're a fellow Rotarian,
p170
aVnice to meet you.
p171
aVWe're Interactors,
p172
aVthe youngest department of Rotary International.
p173
aa(lp174
VIW: But we have also learned much about patience,
p175
aa(lp176
VMW: how to deal with frustrations,
p177
aa(lp178
VIW: leadership,
p179
aa(lp180
VMW: teamwork,
p181
aa(lp182
VIW: friendship,
p183
aa(lp184
VMW: we learned more about the Balinese and their culture
p185
aa(lp186
VIW: and we learned about the importance of commitment.
p187
aa(lp188
VMW: It's not always easy.
p189
aVSometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk.
p190
aa(lp191
VIW: But last year, we did exactly that.
p192
aVWe went to India to give a talk,
p193
aVand our parents took us to visit
p194
aVthe former private house of Mahatma Gandhi.
p195
aVWe learned about the power of hunger strikes
p196
aVhe did to reach his goals.
p197
aVYes, by the end of the tour,
p198
aVwhen we met our parents again,
p199
aVwe both made a decision and said,
p200
aV"We're going on a hunger strike!"
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VMW: And you can probably imagine their faces.
p205
aVIt took a lot of convincing,
p206
aVand not only to our parents
p207
aVbut to our friends and to our teachers as well.
p208
aVIsabel and I were serious about doing this.
p209
aVSo we met with a nutritionist,
p210
aVand we came up with a compromise
p211
aVof not eating from sunrise to sunset every day
p212
aVuntil the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us
p213
aVto talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali.
p214
aa(lp215
VIW: Our "mogak makan," as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia,
p216
aVstarted.
p217
aVWe used social media to support our goal
p218
aVand already on day two,
p219
aVpolice started to come to our home and school.
p220
aVWhat were these two girls doing?
p221
aVWe knew we weren't making the governor look his best
p222
aVby doing this food strike \u2014
p223
aVwe could have gone to jail.
p224
aVBut, hey, it worked.
p225
aVTwenty-four hours later,
p226
aVwe were picked up from school
p227
aVand escorted to the office of the governor.
p228
aa(lp229
VMW: And there he was \u2014
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
Vwaiting for us to meet and speak,
p234
aVbeing all supportive and thankful for our willingness
p235
aVto care for the beauty and the environment of Bali.
p236
aa(lp237
VHe signed a promise
p238
aVto help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags.
p239
aVAnd we are now friends,
p240
aVand on a regular basis,
p241
aVwe remind him and his team of the promises he has made.
p242
aVAnd indeed,
p243
aVrecently he stated and committed
p244
aVthat Bali will be plastic bag free by 2018.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Applause)
p247
aa(lp248
VIW: Also, at the International Airport of Bali, one of our supporters
p249
aVis planning to start a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.
p250
aa(lp251
VMW: Stop handing out free plastic bags
p252
aVand bring in your own reusable bag
p253
aVis our next message to change that mindset of the public.
p254
aa(lp255
VIW: Our short-term campaign,
p256
aV"One Island / One Voice,"
p257
aVis all about this.
p258
aVWe check and recognize the shops and restaurants
p259
aVthat have declared themselves a plastic bag-free zone,
p260
aVand we put this sticker at their entrance
p261
aVand publish their names on social media
p262
aVand some important magazines on Bali.
p263
aVAnd conversely,
p264
aVthat highlights those who do not have the sticker.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VMW: So, why are we actually telling you all of this?
p269
aVWell, partly, it is because we are proud
p270
aVof the results that, together with our team,
p271
aVwe have been able to reach.
p272
aVBut also because along the way,
p273
aVwe have learned that kids can do things.
p274
aVWe can make things happen.
p275
aVIsabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old
p276
aVwhen we started this.
p277
aVWe never had a business plan,
p278
aVnor a fixed strategy,
p279
aVnor any hidden agendas \u2014
p280
aVjust the idea in front of us
p281
aVand a group of friends working with us.
p282
aVAll we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags
p283
aVfrom wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home.
p284
aVKids have a boundless energy
p285
aVand a motivation to be the change the world needs.
p286
aa(lp287
VIW: So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world:
p288
aVgo for it!
p289
aVMake that difference.
p290
aVWe're not telling you it's going to be easy.
p291
aVWe're telling you it's going to be worth it.
p292
aVUs kids may only be 25 percent of the world's population,
p293
aVbut we are 100 percent of the future.
p294
aa(lp295
VMW: We still have a lot of work to do,
p296
aVbut know that we still not stop
p297
aVuntil the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will be
p298
aa(lp299
VBoth: "Welcome to Bali,
p300
aVdo you have nay plastic bags to declare?"
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VOm shanti shanti shanti om.
p305
aa(lp306
VThank you.

Their efforts -- including petitions, beach cleanups, even a hunger strike -- paid off when they convinced their governor to commit to a plastic bag-free Bali by 2018. \\"Don\'t ever let anyone tell you that you\'re too young or you won\'t understand,\\" Isabel says to other aspiring activists. \\"We\'re not telling you it\'s going to be easy.

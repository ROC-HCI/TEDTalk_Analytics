VThis is Shivdutt Yadav,
p5
aVand he's from Uttar Pradesh, India.
p6
aVNow Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office
p7
aVin Uttar Pradesh,
p8
aVand he discovered
p9
aVthat official records were listing him as dead.
p10
aVHis land was no longer registered
p11
aVin his name.
p12
aVHis brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand,
p13
aVwere also listed as dead.
p14
aa(lp15
VFamily members had bribed officials
p16
aVto interrupt the hereditary transfer of land
p17
aVby having the brothers declared dead,
p18
aVallowing them to inherit
p19
aVtheir father's share of the ancestral farmland.
p20
aVBecause of this, all three brothers and their families
p21
aVhad to vacate their home.
p22
aVAccording to the Yadav family,
p23
aVthe local court has been scheduling a case review
p24
aVsince 2001,
p25
aVbut a judge has never appeared.
p26
aa(lp27
VThere are several instances in Uttar Pradesh
p28
aVof people dying
p29
aVbefore their case is given a proper review.
p30
aVShivdutt's father's death and a want for his property
p31
aVled to this corruption.
p32
aVHe was laid to rest in the Ganges River,
p33
aVwhere the dead are cremated along the banks of the river
p34
aVor tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water.
p35
aa(lp36
VPhotographing these brothers
p37
aVwas a disorienting exchange
p38
aVbecause on paper they don't exist,
p39
aVand a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life.
p40
aVYet, these men remain dead.
p41
aVThis quandary led to the title of the project,
p42
aVwhich considers in many ways
p43
aVthat we are all the living dead
p44
aVand that we in some ways represent
p45
aVghosts of the past and the future.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo this story is the first of 18 chapters
p48
aVin my new body of work titled "A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters."
p49
aVAnd for this work,
p50
aVI traveled around the world over a four-year period
p51
aVresearching and recording bloodlines
p52
aVand their related stories.
p53
aVI was interested in ideas surrounding fate
p54
aVand whether our fate is determined
p55
aVby blood, chance or circumstance.
p56
aVThe subjects I documented
p57
aVranged from feuding families in Brazil
p58
aVto victims of genocide in Bosnia
p59
aVto the first woman to hijack an airplane
p60
aVand the living dead in India.
p61
aVIn each chapter, you can see the external forces
p62
aVof governance, power and territory or religion
p63
aVcolliding with the internal forces
p64
aVof psychological and physical inheritance.
p65
aa(lp66
VEach work that I make
p67
aVis comprised of three segments.
p68
aVOn the left are one or more portrait panels
p69
aVin which I systematically order
p70
aVthe members of a given bloodline.
p71
aVThis is followed by a text panel, it's designed in scroll form,
p72
aVin which I construct
p73
aVthe narrative at stake.
p74
aVAnd then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel.
p75
aVIt's a space that's more intuitive
p76
aVin which I present fragments of the story,
p77
aVbeginnings of other stories, photographic evidence.
p78
aVAnd it's meant to kind of reflect
p79
aVhow we engage with histories or stories on the Internet,
p80
aVin a less linear form.
p81
aVSo it's more disordered.
p82
aVAnd this disorder is in direct contrast
p83
aVto the unalterable order of a bloodline.
p84
aa(lp85
VIn my past projects I've often worked in serial form,
p86
aVdocumenting things that have
p87
aVthe appearance of being comprehensive
p88
aVthrough a determined title and a determined presentation,
p89
aVbut in fact, are fairly abstract.
p90
aVIn this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction
p91
aVand find an absolute catalog,
p92
aVsomething that I couldn't interrupt, curate or edit by choice.
p93
aVThis led me to blood.
p94
aVA bloodline is determined and ordered.
p95
aVBut the project centers
p96
aVon the collision of order and disorder \u2014
p97
aVthe order of blood butting up against the disorder
p98
aVrepresented in the often chaotic and violent stories
p99
aVthat are the subjects of my chapters.
p100
aa(lp101
VIn chapter two, I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin.
p102
aVHe was sent in 1907 to Palestine
p103
aVby the Zionist organization
p104
aVto look at areas for Jewish settlement
p105
aVand acquire land for Jewish settlement.
p106
aVHe oversaw land acquisition
p107
aVon behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company
p108
aVwhose work led to the establishment
p109
aVof a Jewish state.
p110
aVThrough my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem,
p111
aVI wanted to look at the early paperwork
p112
aVof the establishment of the Jewish state.
p113
aVAnd I found these maps which you see here.
p114
aVAnd these are studies
p115
aVcommissioned by the Zionist organization
p116
aVfor alternative areas for Jewish settlement.
p117
aVIn this, I was interested in the consequences
p118
aVof geography
p119
aVand imagining how the world would be different
p120
aVif Israel were in Uganda,
p121
aVwhich is what these maps demonstrate.
p122
aVThese archives in Jerusalem,
p123
aVthey maintain a card index file
p124
aVof the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration
p125
aVto Palestine, and later Israel,
p126
aVfrom 1919 to 1965.
p127
aa(lp128
VChapter three:
p129
aVJoseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo
p130
aVtreated patients outside of Kisumu, Kenya
p131
aVfor AIDS, tuberculosis, infertility,
p132
aVmental illness, evil spirits.
p133
aVHe's most often paid for his services
p134
aVin cash, cows or goats.
p135
aVBut sometimes when his female patients
p136
aVcan't afford his services,
p137
aVtheir families give the women to Jura
p138
aVin exchange for medical treatment.
p139
aVAs a result of these transactions,
p140
aVJura has nine wives,
p141
aV32 children
p142
aVand 63 grandchildren.
p143
aVIn his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here.
p144
aa(lp145
VTwo of his wives were brought to him
p146
aVsuffering from infertility
p147
aVand he cured them,
p148
aVthree for evil spirits,
p149
aVone for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain
p150
aVand two wives Ondijo claims he took for love,
p151
aVpaying their families a total of 16 cows.
p152
aVOne wife deserted him
p153
aVand another passed away during treatment for evil spirits.
p154
aVPolygamy is widely practiced in Kenya.
p155
aVIt's common among a privileged class
p156
aVcapable of paying numerous dowries
p157
aVand keeping multiple homes.
p158
aVInstances of prominent social and political figures
p159
aVin polygamous relationships
p160
aVhas led to the perception of polygamy
p161
aVas a symbol of wealth, status and power.
p162
aa(lp163
VYou may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed
p164
aVthere are empty portraits.
p165
aVThese empty portraits represent individuals,
p166
aVliving individuals, who couldn't be present.
p167
aVAnd the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel.
p168
aVThey include dengue fever,
p169
aVimprisonment, army service,
p170
aVwomen not allowed to be photographed
p171
aVfor religious and cultural reasons.
p172
aVAnd in this particular chapter,
p173
aVit's children whose mothers
p174
aVwouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot
p175
aVfor fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it.
p176
aa(lp177
VTwenty-four European rabbits
p178
aVwere brought to Australia in 1859
p179
aVby a British settler
p180
aVfor sporting purposes, for hunting.
p181
aVAnd within a hundred years,
p182
aVthat population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.
p183
aVThe European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia,
p184
aVand it competes with native wildlife
p185
aVand damages native plants
p186
aVand degrades the land.
p187
aVSince the 1950s,
p188
aVAustralia has been introducing lethal diseases
p189
aVinto the wild rabbit population
p190
aVto control growth.
p191
aVThese rabbits were bred at a government facility,
p192
aVBiosecurity Queensland,
p193
aVwhere they bred three bloodlines of rabbits
p194
aVand have infected them with a lethal disease
p195
aVand are monitoring their progress
p196
aVto see if it will effectively kill them.
p197
aVSo they're testing its virulence.
p198
aVDuring the course of this trial, all of the rabbits died,
p199
aVexcept for a few, which were euthanized.
p200
aa(lp201
VHaigh's Chocolate,
p202
aVin collaboration
p203
aVwith the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia,
p204
aVstopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate
p205
aVand has replaced it with the Easter Bilby.
p206
aVNow this was done to counter
p207
aVthe annual celebration of rabbits
p208
aVand presumably make the public more comfortable
p209
aVwith the killing of rabbits
p210
aVand promote an animal that's native to Australia,
p211
aVand actually an animal that is threatened
p212
aVby the European rabbit.
p213
aa(lp214
VIn chapter seven, I focus on the effects
p215
aVof a genocidal act
p216
aVon one bloodline.
p217
aVSo over a two-day period,
p218
aVsix individuals from this bloodline
p219
aVwere killed in the Srebrenica massacre.
p220
aVThis is the only work
p221
aVin which I visually represent the dead.
p222
aVBut I only represent those
p223
aVthat were killed in the Srebrenica massacre,
p224
aVwhich is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe
p225
aVsince the Second World War.
p226
aVAnd during this massacre,
p227
aV8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys
p228
aVwere systematically executed.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo when you look at a detail of this work,
p231
aVyou can see, the man on the upper-left
p232
aVis the father of the woman sitting next to him.
p233
aVHer name is Zumra.
p234
aVShe is followed by her four children,
p235
aVall of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.
p236
aVFollowing those four children is Zumra's younger sister
p237
aVwho is then followed by her children
p238
aVwho were killed as well.
p239
aVDuring the time I was in Bosnia,
p240
aVthe mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son
p241
aVwere exhumed from a mass grave.
p242
aVAnd I was therefore able to photograph
p243
aVthe fully assembled remains.
p244
aVHowever, the other individuals
p245
aVare represented by these blue slides,
p246
aVwhich show tooth and bone samples
p247
aVthat were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members
p248
aVto prove they were the identities
p249
aVof those individuals.
p250
aVThey've all been given a proper burial,
p251
aVso what remains are these blue slides
p252
aVat the International Commission for Missing Persons.
p253
aa(lp254
VThese are personal effects
p255
aVdug up from a mass grave
p256
aVthat are awaiting identification from family members
p257
aVand graffiti at the Potochari battery factory,
p258
aVwhich was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying,
p259
aVand also the Serbian soldiers later
p260
aVduring the times of the executions.
p261
aVThis is video footage used at the Milosevic trial,
p262
aVwhich from top to bottom
p263
aVshows a Serbian scorpion unit
p264
aVbeing blessed by an Orthodox priest
p265
aVbefore rounding up the boys and men
p266
aVand killing them.
p267
aa(lp268
VChapter 15 is more of a performance piece.
p269
aVI solicited China's State Council Information Office in 2009
p270
aVto select a multi-generational bloodline
p271
aVto represent China for this project.
p272
aVThey chose a large family from Beijing for its size,
p273
aVand they declined to give me
p274
aVany further reasoning for their choice.
p275
aVThis is one of the rare situations
p276
aVwhere I have no empty portraits.
p277
aVEveryone showed up.
p278
aVYou can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy
p279
aVas it travels through the bloodline.
p280
aa(lp281
VPreviously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda,
p282
aVthe State Council Information Office
p283
aVis responsible for all of China's external publicity operations.
p284
aVIt controls all foreign media and image production
p285
aVoutside of China
p286
aVfrom foreign media working within China.
p287
aVIt also monitors the Internet
p288
aVand instructs local media
p289
aVon how to handle any potentially controversial issues,
p290
aVincluding Tibet, ethnic minorities,
p291
aVHuman Rights, religion,
p292
aVdemocracy movements and terrorism.
p293
aVFor the footnote panel in this work,
p294
aVthis office instructed me
p295
aVto photograph their central television tower in Beijing.
p296
aVAnd I also photographed the gift bag they gave me
p297
aVwhen I left.
p298
aa(lp299
VThese are the descendants of Hans Frank
p300
aVwho was Hitler's personal legal advisor
p301
aVand governor general of occupied Poland.
p302
aVNow this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits,
p303
aVhighlighting a complex relationship
p304
aVto one's family history.
p305
aVThe reasons for these absences
p306
aVinclude people who declined participation.
p307
aVThere's also parents who participated
p308
aVwho wouldn't let their children participate
p309
aVbecause they thought they were too young to decide for themselves.
p310
aVAnother section of the family
p311
aVpresented their clothing, as opposed to their physical presence,
p312
aVbecause they didn't want to be identified
p313
aVwith the past that I was highlighting.
p314
aVAnd finally, another individual
p315
aVsat for me from behind
p316
aVand later rescinded his participation,
p317
aVso I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable.
p318
aa(lp319
VIn the footnote panel that accompanies this work
p320
aVI photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp
p321
aVand an imitation of that stamp
p322
aVproduced by British Intelligence
p323
aVwith Hans Frank's image on it.
p324
aVIt was released in Poland
p325
aVto create friction between Frank and Hitler,
p326
aVso that Hitler would imagine
p327
aVFrank was trying to usurp his power.
p328
aa(lp329
VAgain, talking about fate,
p330
aVI was interested in the stories and fate
p331
aVof particular works of art.
p332
aVThese paintings were taken by Hans Frank
p333
aVduring the time of the Third Reich.
p334
aVAnd I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time.
p335
aVThey are Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady With an Ermine,"
p336
aVRembrandt's "Landscape With Good Samaritan"
p337
aVand Raphael's "Portrait of a Youth,"
p338
aVwhich has never been found.
p339
aa(lp340
VChapter 12 highlights
p341
aVpeople being born into a battle that is not of their making,
p342
aVbut becomes their own.
p343
aVSo this is the Ferraz family
p344
aVand the Novaes family.
p345
aVAnd they are in an active blood feud.
p346
aVThis feud has been going on since 1991
p347
aVin Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco,
p348
aVand it involved the deaths
p349
aVof 20 members of the families
p350
aVand 40 others associated with the feud,
p351
aVincluding hired hit men, innocent bystanders
p352
aVand friends.
p353
aVTensions between these two families date back to 1913
p354
aVwhen there was a dispute over local political power.
p355
aVBut it got violent in the last two decades
p356
aVand includes decapitation
p357
aVand the death of two mayors.
p358
aVInstalled into a protective wall
p359
aVsurrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes,
p360
aVwho's the head of the Novaes family,
p361
aVare these turret holes,
p362
aVwhich were used for shooting and looking.
p363
aa(lp364
VBrazil's northeast state of Pernambuco
p365
aVis one of the nation's most violent regions.
p366
aVIt's rooted in a principle of retributive justice,
p367
aVor an eye for an eye,
p368
aVso retaliatory killings
p369
aVhave led to several deaths in the area.
p370
aVThis story, like many of the stories in my chapters,
p371
aVreads almost as an archetypal episode,
p372
aVlike something out of Shakespeare,
p373
aVthat's happening now and will happen again in the future.
p374
aVI'm interested in these ideas of repetition.
p375
aVSo after I returned home, I received word
p376
aVthat one member of the family
p377
aVhad been shot 30 times in the face.
p378
aa(lp379
VChapter 17
p380
aVis an exploration of the absence of a bloodline
p381
aVand the absence of a history.
p382
aVChildren at this Ukrainian orphanage
p383
aVare between the ages of six and 16.
p384
aVThis piece is ordered by age
p385
aVbecause it can't be ordered by blood.
p386
aVIn a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage,
p387
aVonly one child had been adopted.
p388
aVChildren have to leave the orphanage at age 16,
p389
aVdespite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go.
p390
aVIt's commonly reported in Ukraine
p391
aVthat children, when leaving the orphanage
p392
aVare targeted for human trafficking,
p393
aVchild pornography and prostitution.
p394
aVMany have to turn to criminal activity for their survival,
p395
aVand high rates of suicide are recorded.
p396
aa(lp397
VThis is a boys' bedroom.
p398
aVThere's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage
p399
aVand not enough warm clothing.
p400
aVChildren bathe infrequently
p401
aVbecause the hot water isn't turned on until October.
p402
aVThis is a girls' bedroom.
p403
aVAnd the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs
p404
aVas an industrial size washing machine and dryer,
p405
aVfour vacuum cleaners, two computers,
p406
aVa video projector, a copy machine,
p407
aVwinter shoes and a dentist's drill.
p408
aVThis photograph, which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms,
p409
aVshows a sign which I had translated when I got home.
p410
aVAnd it reads: "Those who do not know their past
p411
aVare not worthy of their future."
p412
aa(lp413
VThere are many more chapters in this project.
p414
aVThis is just an abridged rendering
p415
aVof over a thousand images.
p416
aVAnd this mass pile of images and stories
p417
aVforms an archive.
p418
aVAnd within this accumulation of images and texts,
p419
aVI'm struggling to find patterns
p420
aVand imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead
p421
aVare just as coded as blood itself.
p422
aVBut archives exist
p423
aVbecause there's something that can't necessarily be articulated.
p424
aVSomething is said in the gaps
p425
aVbetween all the information that's collected.
p426
aVAnd there's this relentless persistence
p427
aVof birth and death
p428
aVand an unending collection of stories in between.
p429
aVIt's almost machine-like
p430
aVthe way people are born and people die,
p431
aVand the stories keep coming and coming.
p432
aVAnd in this, I'm considering,
p433
aVis this actual accumulation
p434
aVleading to some sort of evolution,
p435
aVor are we on repeat
p436
aVover and over again?
p437
aa(lp438
VThank you.

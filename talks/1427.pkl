VSo I want to talk today about money and happiness,
p5
aVwhich are two things a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about,
p6
aVeither trying to earn them or trying to increase them.
p7
aVAnd a lot of us resonate with this phrase,
p8
aVwe see it in religions and self-help books:
p9
aVmoney can't buy happiness.
p10
aVAnd I want to suggest today that, in fact, that's wrong.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VI'm at a business school, so that's what we do.
p15
aVSo that's wrong,
p16
aVand in fact, if you think that, you're just not spending it right.
p17
aVSo instead of spending it the way you usually spend it,
p18
aVmaybe if you spent it differently, that might work a little bit better.
p19
aVBefore I tell you the ways you can spend it that will make you happier,
p20
aVlet's think about the ways we usually spend it
p21
aVthat don't, in fact, make us happier.
p22
aVWe had a little natural experiment.
p23
aVSo CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting article
p24
aVon what happens to people when they win the lottery.
p25
aVIt turns out people think when they win the lottery
p26
aVtheir lives will be amazing.
p27
aVThis article's about how their lives get ruined.
p28
aVWhat happens when people win the lottery
p29
aVis, one, they spend all the money and go into debt;
p30
aVand two, all of their friends and everyone they've ever met
p31
aVfind them and bug them for money.
p32
aVIt ruins their social relationships, in fact.
p33
aVSo they have more debt and worse friendships
p34
aVthan they had before they won the lottery.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhat was interesting about the article was,
p37
aVpeople started commenting on the article, readers of the thing.
p38
aVAnd instead of talking about how it made them realize
p39
aVthat money doesn't lead to happiness,
p40
aVeveryone started saying, "You know what I'd do if I won the lottery ...?"
p41
aVand fantasizing about what they'd do.
p42
aVHere's just two of the ones we saw that are interesting to think about.
p43
aVOne person wrote, "When I win, I'm going to buy my own little mountain
p44
aVand have a little house on top."
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd another person wrote, "I would fill a big bathtub with money
p49
aVand get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar
p50
aVand sipping a glass of champagne."
p51
aVThis is even worse: "... then I'd have a picture taken
p52
aVand dozens of glossies made.
p53
aVAnyone begging for money or trying to extort from me
p54
aVwould receive a copy of the picture and nothing else."
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd so many of the comments were exactly of this type,
p59
aVwhere people got money and, in fact, it made them antisocial.
p60
aVSo I told you it ruins people's lives and their friends bug them.
p61
aVAlso, money often makes us feel very selfish
p62
aVand we do things only for ourselves.
p63
aVWe thought maybe the reason money doesn't make us happy
p64
aVis that we're spending it on the wrong things;
p65
aVin particular, we're always spending it on ourselves.
p66
aVAnd we wondered what would happen
p67
aVif we made people spend more of their money on others.
p68
aVSo instead of being antisocial with your money,
p69
aVwhat if you were more pro-social with it?
p70
aa(lp71
VWe thought, let's make people do it and see what happens.
p72
aVLet's have some people do what they usually do,
p73
aVspend money on themselves,
p74
aVand let's make some people give money away,
p75
aVand measure their happiness and see if, in fact, they get happier.
p76
aVThe first way we did this was, one Vancouver morning,
p77
aVwe went out on the campus at University of British Columbia,
p78
aVapproached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?"
p79
aVThey said, "Yes."
p80
aVWe asked them how happy they were, and then gave them an envelope.
p81
aVOne of the envelopes had things in it that said,
p82
aV"By 5pm today, spend this money on yourself."
p83
aVWe gave some examples of what you could spend it on.
p84
aVOther people got a slip of paper that said,
p85
aV"By 5pm today, spend this money on somebody else."
p86
aVAlso inside the envelope was money.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd we manipulated how much money we gave them;
p89
aVsome people got this slip of paper and five dollars,
p90
aVsome got this slip of paper and 20 dollars.
p91
aVWe let them go about their day and do whatever they wanted.
p92
aVWe found out they did spend it in the way we asked them to.
p93
aVWe called them up and asked them, "What did you spend it on?
p94
aVHow happy do you feel now?"
p95
aVWhat did they spend it on?
p96
aVThese are college undergrads;
p97
aVa lot of what they spent it on for themselves
p98
aVwere things like earrings and makeup.
p99
aVOne woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece.
p100
aVPeople gave money to homeless people.
p101
aVHuge effect here of Starbucks.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VSo if you give undergraduates five dollars,
p106
aVit looks like coffee to them,
p107
aVand they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can.
p108
aVSome people bought coffee for themselves, the way they usually would,
p109
aVbut others bought coffee for somebody else.
p110
aVSo the very same purchase,
p111
aVjust targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else.
p112
aVWhat did we find when we called at the end of the day?
p113
aVPeople who spent money on others got happier;
p114
aVpeople who spent it on themselves, nothing happened.
p115
aVIt didn't make them less happy, it just didn't do much for them.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter much.
p118
aVPeople thought 20 dollars would be way better than five.
p119
aVIn fact, it doesn't matter how much money you spent.
p120
aVWhat really matters is that you spent it on somebody else
p121
aVrather than on yourself.
p122
aVWe see this again and again
p123
aVwhen we give people money to spend on others instead of on themselves.
p124
aVOf course, these are undergraduates in Canada \u2014
p125
aVnot the world's most representative population.
p126
aVThey're also fairly wealthy and affluent and other sorts of things.
p127
aa(lp128
VWe wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world
p129
aVor just among wealthy countries.
p130
aVSo we went to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment.
p131
aVImagine, instead of just people in Canada, we say,
p132
aV"Name the last time you spent money on yourself or others.
p133
aVDescribe it. How happy did it make you?"
p134
aVOr in Uganda, "Name the last time you spent money on yourself or others
p135
aVand describe that."
p136
aVThen we asked them how happy they are, again.
p137
aVAnd what we see is sort of amazing,
p138
aVbecause there's human universals on what you do with your money,
p139
aVand real cultural differences on what you do as well.
p140
aVSo for example, one guy from Uganda says this:
p141
aV"I called a girl I wished to love."
p142
aVThey basically went out on a date,
p143
aVand he says at the end that he didn't "achieve" her up till now.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VHere's a guy from Canada.
p148
aVVery similar thing.
p149
aV"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.
p150
aVWe went to a movie, we left early,
p151
aVand then went back to her room for ... cake," just cake.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VHuman universal:
p156
aVyou spend money on others, you're being nice.
p157
aVMaybe you have something in mind, maybe not.
p158
aVBut then we see extraordinary differences.
p159
aVSo look at these two.
p160
aVThis is a woman from Canada.
p161
aVWe say, "Name a time you spent money on somebody else."
p162
aVShe says, "I bought a present for my mom.
p163
aVI drove to the mall, bought a present, gave it to my mom."
p164
aVPerfectly nice thing to do.
p165
aVIt's good to get gifts for people you know.
p166
aVCompare that to this woman from Uganda:
p167
aV"I was walking and met a longtime friend whose son was sick with malaria.
p168
aVThey had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money."
p169
aVThis isn't $10,000, it's the local currency.
p170
aVSo it's a very small amount of money, in fact.
p171
aVBut enormously different motivations here.
p172
aVThis is a real medical need, literally a lifesaving donation.
p173
aVAbove, it's just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother.
p174
aa(lp175
VWhat we see again, though,
p176
aVis that the specific way you spend on other people isn't nearly as important
p177
aVas the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy,
p178
aVwhich is really quite important.
p179
aVSo you don't have to do amazing things with your money
p180
aVto make yourself happy.
p181
aVYou can do small, trivial things and still get the benefits from doing this.
p182
aVThese are only two countries.
p183
aVWe wanted to look at every country in the world if we could,
p184
aVto see what the relationship is between money and happiness.
p185
aa(lp186
VWe got data from the Gallup Organization,
p187
aVwhich you know from all the political polls happening lately.
p188
aVThey asked people, "Did you donate money to charity recently?"
p189
aVand, "How happy are you with life in general?"
p190
aVWe can see what the relationship is between those two things.
p191
aVAre they positively correlated, giving money makes you happy?
p192
aVOr are they negatively correlated?
p193
aVOn this map, green will mean they're positively correlated,
p194
aVred means they're negatively correlated.
p195
aVAnd you can see, the world is crazily green.
p196
aVSo in almost every country in the world where we have this data,
p197
aVpeople who give money to charity are happier people
p198
aVthan people who don't give money to charity.
p199
aVI know you're looking at the red country in the middle.
p200
aVI would be a jerk and not tell you what it is,
p201
aVbut it's Central African Republic.
p202
aVYou can make up stories.
p203
aVMaybe it's different there for some reason.
p204
aVJust below that to the right is Rwanda, though,
p205
aVwhich is amazingly green.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo almost everywhere we look,
p208
aVwe see that giving money away makes you happier
p209
aVthan keeping it for yourself.
p210
aVWhat about work, which is where we spend the rest of our time,
p211
aVwhen we're not with the people we know.
p212
aVWe decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing.
p213
aVThese are sales teams in Belgium.
p214
aVThey work in teams, go out and sell to doctors
p215
aVand try to get them to buy drugs.
p216
aVWe can look and see how well they sell things
p217
aVas a function of being a member of a team.
p218
aVWe give people on some teams some money
p219
aV"Spend it however you want on yourself,"
p220
aVjust like we did with the undergrads in Canada.
p221
aVTo other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro. Spend it on one of your teammates.
p222
aVBuy them something as a gift and give it to them.
p223
aVThen we can see, we've got teams that spend on themselves
p224
aVand these pro-social teams who we give money to make the team better.
p225
aVThe reason I have a ridiculous pinata there
p226
aVis one team pooled their money and bought a pinata,
p227
aVthey smashed the pinata, the candy fell out and things like that.
p228
aVA silly, trivial thing to do,
p229
aVbut think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all,
p230
aVthat got 15 euro, put it in their pocket, maybe bought themselves a coffee,
p231
aVor teams that had this pro-social experience
p232
aVwhere they bonded together to buy something and do a group activity.
p233
aVWhat we see is that the teams that are pro-social sell more stuff
p234
aVthan the teams that only got money for themselves.
p235
aa(lp236
VOne way to think of it is: for every 15 euro you give people for themselves,
p237
aVthey put it in their pocket and don't do anything different than before.
p238
aVYou don't get money from that;
p239
aVyou lose money, since it doesn't motivate them to perform better.
p240
aVBut when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates,
p241
aVthey do so much better on their teams
p242
aVthat you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money.
p243
aa(lp244
VYou're probably thinking to yourselves, this is all fine,
p245
aVbut there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy,
p246
aVand I can't imagine it would work there.
p247
aVAnd if he doesn't show me that it works here,
p248
aVI don't believe anything he said.
p249
aVI know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VThis was a huge criticism that we got,
p254
aVthat if you can't show it with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.
p255
aVSo we went and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them,
p256
aVand did the exact same thing as before.
p257
aVSo we give people on some teams money to spend on themselves.
p258
aVOther teams, we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates.
p259
aVThe teams that spend money on themselves
p260
aVhave the same winning percentages as before.
p261
aVThe teams we give the money to spend on each other
p262
aVbecome different teams;
p263
aVthey dominate the league by the time they're done.
p264
aa(lp265
VAcross all of these different contexts \u2014
p266
aVyour personal life, you work life, even things like intramural sports \u2014
p267
aVwe see spending on other people has a bigger return for you
p268
aVthan spending on yourself.
p269
aVSo if you think money can't buy happiness, you're not spending it right.
p270
aVThe implication isn't you should buy this product instead of that product,
p271
aVand that's the way to make yourself happier.
p272
aVIt's that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself,
p273
aVand try giving some of it to other people instead.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd we luckily have an opportunity for you.
p276
aVDonorsChoose.org is a nonprofit for mainly public school teachers
p277
aVin low-income schools.
p278
aVThey post projects like,
p279
aV"I want to teach Huckleberry Finn and we don't have the books,"
p280
aVor, "I want a microscope to teach my students science
p281
aVand we don't have a microscope."
p282
aVYou and I can go on and buy it for them.
p283
aVThe teacher and the kids write you thank-you notes,
p284
aVsometimes they send pictures of them using the microscope.
p285
aVIt's an extraordinary thing.
p286
aa(lp287
VGo to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking
p288
aVless about "How can I spend money on myself?"
p289
aVand more about "If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars,
p290
aVwhat can I do to benefit other people?"
p291
aVUltimately, when you do that, you'll find you benefit yourself much more.
p292
aa(lp293
VThank you.

VI feel so fortunate that my first job
p5
aVwas working at the Museum of Modern Art
p6
aVon a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray.
p7
aVI learned so much from her.
p8
aVAfter the curator Robert Storr
p9
aVselected all the paintings
p10
aVfrom her lifetime body of work,
p11
aVI loved looking at the paintings from the 1970s.
p12
aVThere were some motifs and elements
p13
aVthat would come up again later in her life.
p14
aVI remember asking her
p15
aVwhat she thought of those early works.
p16
aVIf you didn't know they were hers,
p17
aVyou might not have been able to guess.
p18
aVShe told me that a few didn't quite meet
p19
aVher own mark for what she wanted them to be.
p20
aVOne of the works, in fact,
p21
aVso didn't meet her mark,
p22
aVshe had set it out in the trash in her studio,
p23
aVand her neighbor had taken it
p24
aVbecause she saw its value.
p25
aa(lp26
VIn that moment, my view of success
p27
aVand creativity changed.
p28
aVI realized that success is a moment,
p29
aVbut what we're always celebrating
p30
aVis creativity and mastery.
p31
aVBut this is the thing: What gets us to convert success
p32
aVinto mastery?
p33
aVThis is a question I've long asked myself.
p34
aVI think it comes when we start to value
p35
aVthe gift of a near win.
p36
aa(lp37
VI started to understand this when I went
p38
aVon one cold May day
p39
aVto watch a set of varsity archers,
p40
aVall women as fate would have it,
p41
aVat the northern tip of Manhattan
p42
aVat Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex.
p43
aVI wanted to see what's called archer's paradox,
p44
aVthe idea that in order to actually hit your target,
p45
aVyou have to aim at something slightly skew from it.
p46
aVI stood and watched as the coach
p47
aVdrove up these women in this gray van,
p48
aVand they exited with this kind of relaxed focus.
p49
aVOne held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand
p50
aVand arrows in the left with yellow fletching.
p51
aVAnd they passed me and smiled,
p52
aVbut they sized me up as they
p53
aVmade their way to the turf,
p54
aVand spoke to each other not with words
p55
aVbut with numbers, degrees, I thought,
p56
aVpositions for how they might plan
p57
aVto hit their target.
p58
aVI stood behind one archer as her coach
p59
aVstood in between us to maybe assess
p60
aVwho might need support, and watched her,
p61
aVand I didn't understand how even one
p62
aVwas going to hit the ten ring.
p63
aVThe ten ring from the standard 75-yard distance,
p64
aVit looks as small as a matchstick tip
p65
aVheld out at arm's length.
p66
aVAnd this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight
p67
aVon each shot.
p68
aVShe first hit a seven, I remember, and then a nine,
p69
aVand then two tens,
p70
aVand then the next arrow
p71
aVdidn't even hit the target.
p72
aVAnd I saw that gave her more tenacity,
p73
aVand she went after it again and again.
p74
aVFor three hours this went on.
p75
aVAt the end of the practice, one of the archers
p76
aVwas so taxed that she lied out on the ground
p77
aVjust star-fished,
p78
aVher head looking up at the sky,
p79
aVtrying to find what T.S. Eliot might call
p80
aVthat still point of the turning world.
p81
aa(lp82
VIt's so rare in American culture,
p83
aVthere's so little that's vocational about it anymore,
p84
aVto look at what doggedness looks like
p85
aVwith this level of exactitude,
p86
aVwhat it means to align your body posture
p87
aVfor three hours in order to hit a target,
p88
aVpursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity.
p89
aVBut I stayed because I realized I was witnessing
p90
aVwhat's so rare to glimpse,
p91
aVthat difference between success and mastery.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo success is hitting that ten ring,
p94
aVbut mastery is knowing that it means nothing
p95
aVif you can't do it again and again.
p96
aVMastery is not just the same as excellence, though.
p97
aVIt's not the same as success,
p98
aVwhich I see as an event,
p99
aVa moment in time,
p100
aVand a label that the world confers upon you.
p101
aVMastery is not a commitment to a goal
p102
aVbut to a constant pursuit.
p103
aVWhat gets us to do this,
p104
aVwhat get us to forward thrust more
p105
aVis to value the near win.
p106
aVHow many times have we designated something
p107
aVa classic, a masterpiece even,
p108
aVwhile its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished,
p109
aVriddled with difficulties and flaws,
p110
aVin other words, a near win?
p111
aVElizabeth Murray surprised me
p112
aVwith her admission about her earlier paintings.
p113
aVPainter Paul Cézanne so often thought his works were incomplete
p114
aVthat he would deliberately leave them aside
p115
aVwith the intention of picking them back up again,
p116
aVbut at the end of his life,
p117
aVthe result was that he had only signed
p118
aV10 percent of his paintings.
p119
aVHis favorite novel was "The [Unknown] Masterpiece" by Honoré de Balzac,
p120
aVand he felt the protagonist was the painter himself.
p121
aVFranz Kafka saw incompletion
p122
aVwhen others would find only works to praise,
p123
aVso much so that he wanted all of his diaries,
p124
aVmanuscripts, letters and even sketches
p125
aVburned upon his death.
p126
aVHis friend refused to honor the request,
p127
aVand because of that, we now have all the works
p128
aVwe now do by Kafka:
p129
aV"America," "The Trial" and "The Castle,"
p130
aVa work so incomplete it even stops mid-sentence.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe pursuit of mastery, in other words,
p133
aVis an ever-onward almost.
p134
aV"Lord, grant that I desire
p135
aVmore than I can accomplish,"
p136
aVMichelangelo implored,
p137
aVas if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel,
p138
aVand he himself was that Adam
p139
aVwith his finger outstretched
p140
aVand not quite touching that God's hand.
p141
aa(lp142
VMastery is in the reaching, not the arriving.
p143
aVIt's in constantly wanting to close that gap
p144
aVbetween where you are and where you want to be.
p145
aVMastery is about sacrificing for your craft
p146
aVand not for the sake of crafting your career.
p147
aVHow many inventors and untold entrepreneurs
p148
aVlive out this phenomenon?
p149
aVWe see it even in the life
p150
aVof the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders,
p151
aVwho tells me that his triumphs
p152
aVare not merely the result
p153
aVof a grand achievement,
p154
aVbut of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins.
p155
aa(lp156
VWe thrive when we stay at our own leading edge.
p157
aVIt's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington,
p158
aVwho said that his favorite song out of his repertoire
p159
aVwas always the next one,
p160
aValways the one he had yet to compose.
p161
aVPart of the reason that the near win
p162
aVis inbuilt to mastery
p163
aVis because the greater our proficiency,
p164
aVthe more clearly we might see
p165
aVthat we don't know all that we thought we did.
p166
aVIt's called the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect.
p167
aVThe Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin
p168
aVwhen they asked him,
p169
aV"What do you think increases with knowledge?"
p170
aVand he said, "You learn how little you know."
p171
aa(lp172
VSuccess motivates us, but a near win
p173
aVcan propel us in an ongoing quest.
p174
aVOne of the most vivid examples of this comes
p175
aVwhen we look at the difference
p176
aVbetween Olympic silver medalists
p177
aVand bronze medalists after a competition.
p178
aVThomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell
p179
aVstudied this difference and found
p180
aVthat the frustration silver medalists feel
p181
aVcompared to bronze, who are typically a bit
p182
aVmore happy to have just not received fourth place
p183
aVand not medaled at all,
p184
aVgives silver medalists a focus
p185
aVon follow-up competition.
p186
aVWe see it even in the gambling industry
p187
aVthat once picked up on this phenomenon
p188
aVof the near win
p189
aVand created these scratch-off tickets
p190
aVthat had a higher than average rate of near wins
p191
aVand so compelled people to buy more tickets
p192
aVthat they were called heart-stoppers,
p193
aVand were set on a gambling industry set of abuses
p194
aVin Britain in the 1970s.
p195
aVThe reason the near win has a propulsion
p196
aVis because it changes our view of the landscape
p197
aVand puts our goals, which we tend to put
p198
aVat a distance, into more proximate vicinity
p199
aVto where we stand.
p200
aVIf I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week,
p201
aVyou might describe it in more general terms.
p202
aVBut if I ask you to describe a great day at TED tomorrow,
p203
aVyou might describe it with granular, practical clarity.
p204
aVAnd this is what a near win does.
p205
aVIt gets us to focus on what, right now,
p206
aVwe plan to do to address that mountain in our sights.
p207
aVIt's Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who in 1984
p208
aVmissed taking the gold in the heptathlon
p209
aVby one third of a second,
p210
aVand her husband predicted that would give her
p211
aVthe tenacity she needed in follow-up competition.
p212
aVIn 1988, she won the gold in the heptathlon
p213
aVand set a record of 7,291 points,
p214
aVa score that no athlete has come very close to since.
p215
aa(lp216
VWe thrive not when we've done it all,
p217
aVbut when we still have more to do.
p218
aVI stand here thinking and wondering
p219
aVabout all the different ways
p220
aVthat we might even manufacture a near win
p221
aVin this room,
p222
aVhow your lives might play this out,
p223
aVbecause I think on some gut level we do know this.
p224
aVWe know that we thrive when we stay
p225
aVat our own leading edge,
p226
aVand it's why the deliberate incomplete
p227
aVis inbuilt into creation myths.
p228
aVIn Navajo culture, some craftsmen and women
p229
aVwould deliberately put an imperfection
p230
aVin textiles and ceramics.
p231
aVIt's what's called a spirit line,
p232
aVa deliberate flaw in the pattern
p233
aVto give the weaver or maker a way out,
p234
aVbut also a reason to continue making work.
p235
aVMasters are not experts because they take
p236
aVa subject to its conceptual end.
p237
aVThey're masters because they realize
p238
aVthat there isn't one.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow it occurred to me, as I thought about this,
p241
aVwhy the archery coach
p242
aVtold me at the end of that practice,
p243
aVout of earshot of his archers,
p244
aVthat he and his colleagues never feel
p245
aVthey can do enough for their team,
p246
aVnever feel there are enough visualization techniques
p247
aVand posture drills to help them overcome
p248
aVthose constant near wins.
p249
aVIt didn't sound like a complaint, exactly,
p250
aVbut just a way to let me know,
p251
aVa kind of tender admission,
p252
aVto remind me that he knew he was giving himself over
p253
aVto a voracious, unfinished path
p254
aVthat always required more.
p255
aa(lp256
VWe build out of the unfinished idea,
p257
aVeven if that idea is our former self.
p258
aVThis is the dynamic of mastery.
p259
aVComing close to what you thought you wanted
p260
aVcan help you attain more than you ever dreamed
p261
aVyou could.
p262
aVIt's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray
p263
aVwas thinking when I saw her smiling
p264
aVat those early paintings one day
p265
aVin the galleries.
p266
aVEven if we created utopias, I believe
p267
aVwe would still have the incomplete.
p268
aVCompletion is a goal,
p269
aVbut we hope it is never the end.
p270
aa(lp271
VThank you.

VLet me show you some images
p5
aVof what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.
p6
aVSo, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi.
p7
aVThis is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park
p8
aVin Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days.
p9
aVThis is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela
p10
aVin Rio de Janeiro.
p11
aVAnd this is Sultanbelyi,
p12
aVwhich is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul.
p13
aVThey are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow,
p14
aVthe new urban world.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, why do I say that?
p17
aVTo tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here,
p18
aVhis name is Julius.
p19
aVAnd I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera.
p20
aVSo, I had been there almost three months,
p21
aVand I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas
p22
aVand Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed
p23
aVand at certain points we were walking around,
p24
aVhe grabbed my hand for support,
p25
aVwhich is something most Kenyans would never consider doing.
p26
aVThey're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly.
p27
aVAnd I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi,
p28
aVand he's one of many.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo, close to 200,000 people a day
p31
aVmigrate from the rural to the urban areas.
p32
aVThat's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians
p33
aVwho talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week,
p34
aVbut almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist,
p35
aVand we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week,
p36
aVclose to 70 million people a year.
p37
aVAnd if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.
p38
aVSo, that'll be \u2014 in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here,
p39
aVbetween two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities.
p40
aVAnd here are the statistics.
p41
aVToday \u2014 a billion squatters,
p42
aVone in six people on the planet.
p43
aV2030 \u2014 two billion squatters,
p44
aVone in four people on the planet.
p45
aVAnd the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters,
p46
aVbetter than one in three people on earth.
p47
aVSo, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd I was thinking this morning of the good life,
p50
aVand before I show you the rest of my presentation,
p51
aVI'm going to violate TED rules here,
p52
aVand I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can.
p53
aVBecause I think it says something about reversing our perception
p54
aVof what we think the good life is.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo \u2014 "The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.
p57
aVIt was a 10 by 10 cell.
p58
aVArmstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men.
p59
aVArmstrong and his friends had no water \u2014
p60
aVthey bought it from a nearby tap owner \u2014
p61
aVno toilet \u2014 the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine \u2014
p62
aVand no sewers or sanitation.
p63
aVThey did have electricity,
p64
aVbut it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires,
p65
aVand could only power one feeble bulb.
p66
aVThis was Southland, a small shanty community
p67
aVon the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.
p68
aVBut it could've been anywhere in the city,
p69
aVbecause more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.
p70
aV1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts
p71
aVwith no services, no toilets, no rights.
p72
aa(lp73
V"Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation:
p74
aVthey paid 1,500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month,
p75
aVa relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown,
p76
aVand they could not afford to be late with the money.
p77
aV'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen
p78
aVand bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said.
p79
aV'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu,
p80
aVwho was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction
p81
aVthat is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation.
p82
aVThey called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person
p83
aVwho has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.
p84
aVHilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes;
p85
aVthe sun slammed down on the thin steel roof;
p86
aVand we perspired as we ate.
p87
aa(lp88
V"After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie,
p89
aVput on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.
p90
aVOutside a mound of garbage formed the border
p91
aVbetween Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.
p92
aVIt was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.
p93
aVAnd it was set in a wider watery ooze.
p94
aVAs we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash.
p95
aVThey couldn't have been more than five or six years old.
p96
aVThey were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck
p97
aVsending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.
p98
aVI thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.
p99
aVOnce atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts,
p100
aVsquatted, and defecated.
p101
aVThe flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.
p102
aVWhen 20 families \u2014 100 people or so \u2014 share a single latrine,
p103
aVa boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.
p104
aVBut it stood in jarring contrast
p105
aVto something Armstrong had said as we were eating \u2014
p106
aVthat he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.
p107
aa(lp108
V"For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions.
p109
aVInstead, the human spirit radiated out
p110
aVfrom the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something
p111
aVno legal neighborhood could: freedom.
p112
aV'This place is very addictive,' he had said.
p113
aV'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you.
p114
aVNobody is controlling what you do.
p115
aVOnce you have stayed here, you cannot go back.'
p116
aVHe meant back beyond that mountain of trash,
p117
aVback in the legal city, of legal buildings,
p118
aVwith legal leases and legal rights.
p119
aV'Once you have stayed here,' he said,
p120
aV'you can stay for the rest of your life.'"
p121
aa(lp122
VSo, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.
p123
aa(lp124
VThis is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera,
p125
aVlittle more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap.
p126
aVThis is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India.
p127
aVThis is home improvement:
p128
aVputting plastic tarps on your roof.
p129
aa(lp130
VThis is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right?
p131
aVWe're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs,
p132
aVand plaster over the brick, some color,
p133
aVand this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better.
p134
aVHe's got a fence; he scavenged a door;
p135
aVhe's got new tile on the roof.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd then you get Rocinha
p138
aVand you can see that it's getting even better.
p139
aVThe buildings here are multi-story.
p140
aVThey develop \u2014 you can see on the far right
p141
aVone where it seems to just stack on top of each other,
p142
aVroom, after room, after room.
p143
aVAnd what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories,
p144
aVand they sell their loggia or roof rights,
p145
aVand someone else builds on top of their building,
p146
aVand then that person sells the roof rights,
p147
aVand someone else builds on top of their building.
p148
aVAll of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built
p151
aVto a higher level of design.
p152
aVThe crud in the front is mattress stuffing,
p153
aVand you see that all over Turkey.
p154
aVPeople dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs.
p155
aVBut the green building, on behind,
p156
aVyou can see that the top floor is not occupied,
p157
aVso people are building with the possibility of expansion.
p158
aVAnd it's built to a pretty high standard of design.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd then you finally get squatter homes like this,
p161
aVwhich is built on the suburban model.
p162
aVHey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.
p163
aVThat's also in Istanbul, Turkey.
p164
aVThey're quite vital places, these communities.
p165
aa(lp166
VThis is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea,
p167
aVand there's a bus route that runs through it,
p168
aVlots of people out on the street.
p169
aVThese communities in these cities are actually more vital
p170
aVthan the illegal communities.
p171
aVThey have more things going on in them.
p172
aa(lp173
VThis is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a "beco" \u2014
p174
aVthese are how you get around the community.
p175
aVIt's on very steep ground.
p176
aVThey're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio,
p177
aVand you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions.
p178
aVSo, that's just a rock in the hillside.
p179
aVAnd these becos are normally very crowded,
p180
aVand people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them,
p181
aVall sorts of things.
p182
aVBeer is all carried in on your shoulders.
p183
aVBeer is a very important thing in Brazil.
p184
aa(lp185
VThis is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks,
p186
aVso close to the train tracks that the merchants
p187
aVsometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way.
p188
aVThis is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market,
p189
aVlots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy.
p190
aVThose green things in the foreground are mangoes.
p191
aa(lp192
VThis is a shopping street in Kibera,
p193
aVand you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic,
p194
aVtwo beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more.
p195
aVIt's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built.
p196
aVThis here, on the right-hand side,
p197
aVis what's called a \u2014 if you look at the fine print under the awning \u2014
p198
aVit's a hotel.
p199
aVAnd what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place.
p200
aVSo, that's a restaurant.
p201
aa(lp202
VPeople steal electrical power \u2014 this is Rio.
p203
aVPeople tap in and they have thieves who are called "grillos" or "crickets,"
p204
aVand they steal the electrical power
p205
aVand wire the neighborhood.
p206
aVPeople burn trash to get rid of the garbage,
p207
aVand they dig their own sewer channels.
p208
aVTalk about more plastic bags than plankton.
p209
aVAnd sometimes they have natural trash-disposal.
p210
aVAnd when they have more money they cement their streets,
p211
aVand they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that.
p212
aVThis is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place,
p213
aVand that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do:
p214
aVthey steal electricity; they install a pump
p215
aVand they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village,
p218
aVto the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi?
p219
aVI say there are two things.
p220
aVOne is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.
p221
aVThat does not necessarily mean property rights,
p222
aVand I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question,
p223
aVbecause property rights create a lot of complications.
p224
aVThey're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt
p225
aVand have to pay back the debt,
p226
aVand sometimes have to sell their property
p227
aVin order to pay back the debt.
p228
aVThere's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights
p229
aVsometimes don't work in these cases,
p230
aVbut they do need security of tenure.
p231
aVAnd they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.
p232
aVThat can mean community organizing from below,
p233
aVbut it can also mean possibilities from above.
p234
aVAnd I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.
p235
aa(lp236
VTurkey has two great laws that protect squatters.
p237
aVOne is that \u2014 it's called "gecekondu" in Turkish,
p238
aVwhich means "built overnight," and if you build your house overnight
p239
aVin Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law,
p240
aVif they don't catch you during the night.
p241
aVAnd the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people
p242
aVin the community, you can petition the government
p243
aVto be recognized as a legal sub-municipality.
p244
aVAnd when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.
p245
aVYou're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes,
p246
aVprovide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo, these are the civic leaders of the future.
p249
aVThe woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa.
p250
aVShe lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.
p251
aVThat's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family
p252
aVon the tent along the same highway median.
p253
aVThey're very outspoken. They're very active.
p254
aVThey can be community leaders.
p255
aVThis woman is Nine, which means "grandma" in Turkish.
p256
aVAnd there were three old ladies who lived in \u2014
p257
aVthat's her self-built house behind her \u2014 and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years,
p258
aVand they are the backbone of the community there.
p259
aa(lp260
VThis is Richard Muthama Peter,
p261
aVand he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.
p262
aVHe makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood,
p263
aVand the people in the neighborhood,
p264
aVand is a great resource in the community.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio,
p267
aVthe fruit merchant with his two kids here,
p268
aVand a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know.
p269
aa(lp270
VThe future of these communities is in the people
p271
aVand in our ability to work with those people.
p272
aVSo, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book,
p273
aVfrom what Armstrong said, and from all these people,
p274
aVis that these are neighborhoods.
p275
aVThe issue is not urban poverty.
p276
aVThe issue is not the larger, over-arching thing.
p277
aVThe issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods \u2014
p278
aVthis is a legitimate form of urban development \u2014
p279
aVand that cities have to engage these residents,
p280
aVbecause they are building the cities of the future.
p281
aa(lp282
VThank you very much.

VSo today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank,
p5
aVand it's clear that the general public needs guidance,
p6
aVbecause the average bank robbery nets
p7
aVonly 7,500 dollars.
p8
aVRank amateurs who know nothing
p9
aVabout how to cook the books.
p10
aa(lp11
VThe folks who know, of course,
p12
aVrun our largest banks,
p13
aVand in the last go-around,
p14
aVthey cost us over 11 trillion dollars.
p15
aVThat's what 11 trillion looks like.
p16
aVThat's how many zeros?
p17
aVAnd cost us over 10 million jobs as well.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo our task is to educate ourselves
p20
aVso that we can understand
p21
aVwhy we have these recurrent,
p22
aVintensifying financial crises,
p23
aVand how we can prevent them in the future.
p24
aVAnd the answer to that is
p25
aVthat we have to stop epidemics of control fraud.
p26
aVControl fraud is what happens
p27
aVwhen the people who control,
p28
aVtypically a CEO,
p29
aVa seemingly legitimate entity,
p30
aVuse it as a weapon to defraud.
p31
aVAnd these are the weapons of mass destruction
p32
aVin the financial world.
p33
aa(lp34
VThey also follow in finance a particular strategy,
p35
aVbecause the weapon of choice in finance
p36
aVis accounting,
p37
aVand there is a recipe for accounting
p38
aVcontrol fraud, and how it occurs.
p39
aVAnd we discovered this recipe
p40
aVin quite an odd way that I'll come back to in a moment.
p41
aVFirst ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy;
p42
aVsecond, by making or buying really crappy loans,
p43
aVbut loans that are made at a very high interest rate
p44
aVor yield;
p45
aVthree, while employing extreme leverage \u2014
p46
aVthat just means a lot of debt \u2014
p47
aVcompared to your equity;
p48
aVand four, while providing only trivial loss reserves
p49
aVagainst the inevitable losses.
p50
aVIf you follow those four simple steps,
p51
aVand any bank can follow them,
p52
aVthen you are mathematically guaranteed
p53
aVto have three things occur.
p54
aVThe first thing is
p55
aVyou will report record bank profits \u2014
p56
aVnot just high, record.
p57
aVTwo, the CEO will immediately be made incredibly wealthy
p58
aVby modern executive compensation.
p59
aVAnd three, farther down the road,
p60
aVthe bank will suffer catastrophic losses
p61
aVand will fail unless it is bailed out.
p62
aVAnd that's a hint as to how
p63
aVwe discovered this recipe,
p64
aVbecause we discovered it through an autopsy process.
p65
aVDuring the savings and loan debacle in 1984,
p66
aVwe looked at every single failure,
p67
aVand we looked for common characteristics,
p68
aVand we discovered this recipe was common
p69
aVto each of these frauds.
p70
aVIn other words, a coroner could find these things
p71
aVbecause this is a fatal recipe
p72
aVthat will destroy the banks
p73
aVas well as the economy.
p74
aVAnd it also turns out to be precisely
p75
aVwhat could have stopped this crisis,
p76
aVthe one that cost us 11 trillion dollars
p77
aVjust in the household sector,
p78
aVthat cost us 10 million jobs,
p79
aVwas the easiest financial crisis by far
p80
aVto have avoided completely
p81
aVif we had simply learned the lessons
p82
aVof epidemics of control fraud,
p83
aVparticularly using this recipe.
p84
aVSo let's go to this crisis,
p85
aVand the two huge epidemics
p86
aVof loan origination fraud that drove the crisis \u2014
p87
aVappraisal fraud and liar's loans \u2014
p88
aVand what we're going to see
p89
aVin looking at both of these is
p90
aVwe got warnings that were incredibly early
p91
aVabout these frauds.
p92
aVWe got warnings that we could have taken advantage of easily,
p93
aVbecause back in the savings and loan debacle,
p94
aVwe had figured out how to respond
p95
aVand prevent these crises.
p96
aVAnd three, the warnings were unambiguous.
p97
aVThey were obvious that what was going on
p98
aVwas an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up.
p99
aa(lp100
VLet's take appraisal fraud first.
p101
aVThis is simply where you inflate the value
p102
aVof the home that is being pledged
p103
aVas security for the loan.
p104
aVIn 2000, the year 2000,
p105
aVthat is over a year before Enron fails, by the way,
p106
aVthe honest appraisers got together a formal petition
p107
aVbegging the federal government to act,
p108
aVand the industry to act,
p109
aVto stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud.
p110
aVAnd the appraisers explained how it was occurring,
p111
aVthat banks were demanding that appraisers
p112
aVinflate the appraisal,
p113
aVand that if the appraisers refused to do so,
p114
aVthey, the banks, would blacklist
p115
aVhonest appraisers
p116
aVand refuse to use them.
p117
aVNow, we've seen this before
p118
aVin the savings and loan debacle,
p119
aVand we know that this kind of fraud
p120
aVcan only originate from the lenders,
p121
aVand that no honest lender would ever inflate
p122
aVthe appraisal,
p123
aVbecause it's the great protection against loss.
p124
aVSo this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.
p125
aVIt was something we'd seen before,
p126
aVand it was completely unambiguous.
p127
aVThis was an epidemic of accounting control fraud
p128
aVled by the banks.
p129
aa(lp130
VWhat about liar's loans?
p131
aVWell, that warning actually comes earlier.
p132
aVThe savings and loan debacle is basically
p133
aVthe early 1980s through 1993,
p134
aVand in the midst of fighting that wave
p135
aVof accounting control fraud,
p136
aVin 1990, we found that a second front
p137
aVof fraud was being started.
p138
aVAnd like all good financial frauds in America,
p139
aVit began in Orange County, California.
p140
aVAnd we happened to be the regional regulators for it.
p141
aVAnd our examiners said,
p142
aVthey are making loans without even checking
p143
aVwhat the borrower's income is.
p144
aVThis is insane, it has to lead to massive losses,
p145
aVand it only makes sense for entities engaged
p146
aVin these accounting control frauds.
p147
aVAnd we said, yeah, you're absolutely right,
p148
aVand we drove those liar's loans
p149
aVout of the industry in 1990 and 1991,
p150
aVbut we could only deal with the industry
p151
aVwe had jurisdiction over,
p152
aVwhich was savings and loans,
p153
aVand so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds,
p154
aVLong Beach Savings, voluntarily gave up
p155
aVits federal savings and loan charter,
p156
aVgave up federal deposit insurance,
p157
aVconverted to become a mortgage bank
p158
aVfor the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction,
p159
aVand changed its name to Ameriquest,
p160
aVand became the most notorious
p161
aVof the liar's loans frauds early on,
p162
aVand to add to that,
p163
aVthey deliberately predated upon minorities.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo we knew again about this crisis.
p166
aVWe'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before.
p167
aVWe had incredibly early warnings of it,
p168
aVand it was absolutely unambiguous
p169
aVthat no honest lender would make loans in this fashion.
p170
aVSo let's take a look at the reaction
p171
aVof the industry and the regulators
p172
aVand the prosecutors to these clear
p173
aVearly warnings that could have prevented the crisis.
p174
aa(lp175
VStart with the industry.
p176
aVThe industry responded between 2003 and 2006
p177
aVby increasing liar's loans
p178
aVby over 500 percent.
p179
aVThese were the loans
p180
aVthat hyperinflated the bubble
p181
aVand produced the economic crisis.
p182
aVBy 2006, half of all the loans called subprime
p183
aVwere also liar's loans.
p184
aVThey're not mutually exclusive, it's just that together,
p185
aVthey're the most toxic combination
p186
aVyou can possibly imagine.
p187
aVBy 2006, 40 percent of all the loans
p188
aVmade that year, all the home loans made that year,
p189
aVwere liar's loans,
p190
aV40 percent.
p191
aVAnd this is despite a warning
p192
aVfrom the industry's own antifraud experts
p193
aVthat said that these loans were an open invitation
p194
aVto fraudsters,
p195
aVand that they had a fraud incidence
p196
aVof 90 percent,
p197
aVnine zero.
p198
aVIn response to that, the industry
p199
aVfirst started calling these loans liar's loans,
p200
aVwhich lacks a certain subtlety,
p201
aVand second, massively increased them,
p202
aVand no government regulator ever
p203
aVrequired or encouraged any lender
p204
aVto make a liar's loan
p205
aVor anyone to purchase a liar's loan,
p206
aVand that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie.
p207
aVThis came from the lenders
p208
aVbecause of the fraud recipe.
p209
aa(lp210
VWhat happened to appraisal fraud?
p211
aVIt expanded remarkably as well.
p212
aVBy 2007, when a survey of appraisers was done,
p213
aV90 percent of appraisers reported
p214
aVthat they had been subject to coercion
p215
aVfrom the lenders trying to get them
p216
aVto inflate an appraisal.
p217
aVIn other words, both forms of fraud
p218
aVbecame absolutely endemic and normal,
p219
aVand this is what drove the bubble.
p220
aa(lp221
VWhat happened in the governmental sector?
p222
aVWell, the government, as I told you,
p223
aVwhen we were the savings and loan regulators,
p224
aVwe could only deal with our industry,
p225
aVand if people gave up their federal deposit insurance,
p226
aVwe couldn't do anything to them.
p227
aVCongress, it may strike you as impossible,
p228
aVbut actually did something intelligent in 1994,
p229
aVand passed the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act
p230
aVthat gave the Fed, and only the Federal Reserve,
p231
aVthe explicit, statutory authority to ban liar's loans
p232
aVby every lender,
p233
aVwhether or not they had federal deposit insurance.
p234
aVSo what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan,
p235
aVas chairs of the Fed, do
p236
aVwhen they got these warnings
p237
aVthat these were massively fraudulent loans
p238
aVand that they were being sold to the secondary market?
p239
aVRemember, there's no fraud exorcist.
p240
aVOnce it starts out a fraudulent loan,
p241
aVit can only be sold to the secondary market
p242
aVthrough more frauds,
p243
aVlying about the reps and warrantees,
p244
aVand then those people are going to produce
p245
aVmortgage-backed securities
p246
aVand exotic derivatives
p247
aVwhich are also going to be supposedly backed
p248
aVby those fraudulent loans.
p249
aVSo the fraud is going to progress
p250
aVthrough the entire system,
p251
aVhyperinflate the bubble, produce a disaster.
p252
aVAnd remember, we had experience with this.
p253
aVWe had seen significant losses,
p254
aVand we had experience of competent regulators
p255
aVin stopping it.
p256
aVGreenspan and Bernanke refused
p257
aVto use the authority under the statute
p258
aVto stop liar's loans.
p259
aVAnd this was a matter first of dogma.
p260
aVThey're just horrifically opposed
p261
aVto anything regulatory.
p262
aVBut it is also the international competition in laxity,
p263
aVthe race to the bottom
p264
aVbetween the United States and the United Kingdom,
p265
aVthe city of London, in particular,
p266
aVand the city of London won that race to the bottom,
p267
aVbut it meant that all regulation in the West
p268
aVwas completely degraded
p269
aVin this stupid competition to be
p270
aVwho could have the weakest regulation.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo that was the regulatory response.
p273
aVWhat about the response of the prosecutors
p274
aVafter the crisis,
p275
aVafter 11 trillion dollars in losses,
p276
aVafter 10 million jobs lost,
p277
aVa crisis in which the losses and the frauds
p278
aVwere more than 70 times larger
p279
aVthan the savings and loan debacle?
p280
aVWell, in the savings and loan debacle,
p281
aVour agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS,
p282
aVmade over 30,000 criminal referrals,
p283
aVproduced over 1,000 felony convictions
p284
aVjust in cases designated as major,
p285
aVand that understates the degree of prioritization,
p286
aVbecause we worked with the FBI
p287
aVto create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,
p288
aVthe absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.
p289
aVRoughly 300 savings and loans involved,
p290
aVroughly 600 senior officials.
p291
aVVirtually all of them were prosecuted.
p292
aVWe had a 90 percent conviction rate.
p293
aVIt's the greatest success against
p294
aVelite white collar criminals ever,
p295
aVand it was because of this understanding
p296
aVof control fraud
p297
aVand the accounting control fraud mechanism.
p298
aa(lp299
VFlash forward to the current crisis.
p300
aVThe same agency, Office of Thrift Supervision,
p301
aVwhich was supposed to regulate
p302
aVmany of the largest makers of liar's loans
p303
aVin the country,
p304
aVhas made, even today \u2014 it no longer exists,
p305
aVbut as of a year ago,
p306
aVit had made zero criminal referrals.
p307
aVThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
p308
aVwhich is supposed to regulate the largest national banks,
p309
aVhas made zero criminal referrals.
p310
aVThe Fed appears to have made
p311
aVzero criminal referrals.
p312
aVThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
p313
aVis smart enough to refuse to answer the question.
p314
aVWithout any guidance from the regulators,
p315
aVthere's no expertise in the FBI
p316
aVto investigate complex frauds.
p317
aVIt isn't simply that they've had
p318
aVto reinvent the wheel
p319
aVof how to do these prosecutions;
p320
aVthey've forgotten that the wheel exists,
p321
aVand therefore, we have zero prosecutions,
p322
aVand of course, zero convictions,
p323
aVof any of the elite bank frauds,
p324
aVthe Wall Street types,
p325
aVthat drove this crisis.
p326
aa(lp327
VWith no expertise coming from the regulators,
p328
aVthe FBI formed what it calls a partnership
p329
aVwith the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2007.
p330
aVThe Mortgage Bankers Association
p331
aVis the trade association of the perps.
p332
aVAnd the Mortgage Bankers Association
p333
aVset out, it had the audacity and the success
p334
aVto con the FBI.
p335
aVIt had created a supposed definition
p336
aVof mortgage fraud, in which, guess what,
p337
aVits members are always the victim
p338
aVand never the perpetrators.
p339
aVAnd the FBI has bought this hook, line, sinker,
p340
aVrod, reel and the boat they rode out in.
p341
aVAnd so the FBI,
p342
aVunder the leadership of an attorney general
p343
aVwho is African-American
p344
aVand a president of the United States who is African-American,
p345
aVhave adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis,
p346
aVin which it is the first virgin crisis in history,
p347
aVconceived without sin in the executive ranks.
p348
aVAnd it's those oh-so-clever hairdressers
p349
aVwho were able to defraud the poor, pitiful banks,
p350
aVwho lack any financial sophistication.
p351
aVIt is the silliest story you can conceive of,
p352
aVand so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers,
p353
aVand they leave the banksters alone entirely.
p354
aVAnd so, while lions are roaming the campsite,
p355
aVthe FBI is chasing mice.
p356
aa(lp357
VWhat do we need to do?
p358
aVWhat can we do in all of this?
p359
aVWe need to change the perverse incentive structures
p360
aVthat produce these recurrent epidemics
p361
aVof accounting control fraud
p362
aVthat are driving our crises.
p363
aVSo we have to first get rid
p364
aVof the systemically dangerous institutions.
p365
aVThese are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions.
p366
aVWe need to shrink them to the point,
p367
aVwithin the next five years,
p368
aVthat they no longer pose a systemic risk.
p369
aVRight now, they are ticking time bombs
p370
aVthat will cause a global crisis
p371
aVas soon as the next one fails \u2014
p372
aVnot if, when.
p373
aVSecond thing we need to do is completely reform
p374
aVmodern executive and professional compensation,
p375
aVwhich is what they use to suborn the appraisers.
p376
aVRemember, they were pressuring the appraisers
p377
aVthrough the compensation system,
p378
aVtrying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic,
p379
aVin which bad ethics drives good ethics
p380
aVout of the marketplace.
p381
aVAnd they largely succeeded,
p382
aVwhich is how the fraud became endemic.
p383
aVAnd the third thing that we need to do
p384
aVis deal with what we call the three D's:
p385
aVderegulation, desupervision,
p386
aVand the de facto decriminalization.
p387
aVBecause we can make
p388
aVall three of these changes, and if we do so,
p389
aVwe can dramatically reduce
p390
aVhow often we have a crisis
p391
aVand how severe those crises are.
p392
aVThat is not simply critical to our economy.
p393
aVYou can see what these crises do to inequality
p394
aVand what they do to our democracy.
p395
aVThey have produced crony capitalism,
p396
aVAmerican-style,
p397
aVin which the largest financial institutions
p398
aVare the leading financial donors of both parties,
p399
aVand that's the reason why
p400
aVeven after this crisis,
p401
aV70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis,
p402
aVwe have no meaningful reforms
p403
aVin any of the three areas that I've talked about,
p404
aVother than banning liar's loans,
p405
aVwhich is good,
p406
aVbut that's just one form of ammunition
p407
aVfor this fraud weapon.
p408
aVThere are many forms of ammunition they can use.
p409
aa(lp410
VThat's why we need to learn
p411
aVwhat the bankers have learned:
p412
aVthe recipe for the best way to rob a bank,
p413
aVso that we can stop that recipe,
p414
aVbecause our legislators,
p415
aVwho are dependent on political contributions,
p416
aVwill not do it on their own.
p417
aa(lp418
VThank you very much.

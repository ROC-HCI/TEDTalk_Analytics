VWhat started as a platform for hobbyists
p5
aVis poised to become a multibillion-dollar industry.
p6
aVInspection, environmental monitoring, photography and film and journalism:
p7
aVthese are some of the potential applications for commercial drones,
p8
aVand their enablers are the capabilities being developed
p9
aVat research facilities around the world.
p10
aa(lp11
VFor example, before aerial package delivery
p12
aVentered our social consciousness,
p13
aVan autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower
p14
aVcomposed of 1,500 bricks
p15
aVin front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France,
p16
aVand several years ago, they started to fly with ropes.
p17
aVBy tethering flying machines,
p18
aVthey can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces.
p19
aVThey can also autonomously build tensile structures.
p20
aVSkills learned include how to carry loads,
p21
aVhow to cope with disturbances,
p22
aVand in general, how to interact with the physical world.
p23
aa(lp24
VToday we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on.
p25
aVTheir aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved
p26
aVwith autonomous flight.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, for a system to function autonomously,
p29
aVit must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space.
p30
aVBack at our lab at ETH Zurich,
p31
aVwe often use external cameras to locate objects,
p32
aVwhich then allows us to focus our efforts
p33
aVon the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks.
p34
aVFor the demos you will see today, however,
p35
aVwe will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios,
p36
aVa spin-off from our lab.
p37
aVThere are no external cameras.
p38
aVEach flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space
p39
aVand onboard computation to determine what its actions should be.
p40
aVThe only external commands are high-level ones
p41
aVsuch as "take off" and "land."
p42
aa(lp43
VThis is a so-called tail-sitter.
p44
aVIt's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it.
p45
aVLike other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight,
p46
aVmuch more so than helicopters and variations thereof.
p47
aVUnlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however,
p48
aVit is capable of hovering,
p49
aVwhich has huge advantages for takeoff, landing
p50
aVand general versatility.
p51
aVThere is no free lunch, unfortunately.
p52
aVOne of the limitations with tail-sitters
p53
aVis that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts.
p54
aVWe're developing new control architectures and algorithms
p55
aVthat address this limitation.
p56
aVThe idea is for the aircraft to recover
p57
aVno matter what state it finds itself in,
p58
aVand through practice, improve its performance over time.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VOK.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhen doing research,
p65
aVwe often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions
p66
aVthat try to get at the heart of a matter.
p67
aVFor example, one such question would be,
p68
aVwhat is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight?
p69
aVNow, there are practical reasons
p70
aVwhy you may want to know the answer to such a question.
p71
aVHelicopters, for example,
p72
aVare affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts
p73
aVall conspiring to do you bodily harm.
p74
aVIt turns out that decades ago,
p75
aVskilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft
p76
aVthat had only two moving parts:
p77
aVa propeller and a tail rudder.
p78
aVWe recently discovered that it could be done with just one.
p79
aa(lp80
VThis is the monospinner,
p81
aVthe world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine,
p82
aVinvented just a few months ago.
p83
aVIt has only one moving part, a propeller.
p84
aVIt has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons,
p85
aVno other actuators, no other control surfaces,
p86
aVjust a simple propeller.
p87
aVEven though it's mechanically simple,
p88
aVthere's a lot going on in its little electronic brain
p89
aVto allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space.
p90
aVEven so, it doesn't yet have
p91
aVthe sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter,
p92
aVwhich means that in order to get it to fly,
p93
aVI have to throw it just right.
p94
aVAnd because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low,
p95
aVgiven everybody watching me,
p96
aVwhat we're going to do instead
p97
aVis show you a video that we shot last night.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
V(Applause)
p102
aa(lp103
VIf the monospinner is an exercise in frugality,
p104
aVthis machine here, the omnicopter, with its eight propellers,
p105
aVis an exercise in excess.
p106
aVWhat can you do with all this surplus?
p107
aVThe thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric.
p108
aVAs a result, it is ambivalent to orientation.
p109
aVThis gives it an extraordinary capability.
p110
aVIt can move anywhere it wants in space
p111
aVirrespective of where it is facing
p112
aVand even of how it is rotating.
p113
aVIt has its own complexities,
p114
aVmainly having to do with the interacting flows
p115
aVfrom its eight propellers.
p116
aVSome of this can be modeled, while the rest can be learned on the fly.
p117
aVLet's take a look.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Applause)
p120
aa(lp121
VIf flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives,
p122
aVthey will need to become extremely safe and reliable.
p123
aVThis machine over here
p124
aVis actually two separate two-propeller flying machines.
p125
aVThis one wants to spin clockwise.
p126
aVThis other one wants to spin counterclockwise.
p127
aVWhen you put them together,
p128
aVthey behave like one high-performance quadrocopter.
p129
aVIf anything goes wrong, however \u2014
p130
aVa motor fails, a propeller fails, electronics, even a battery pack \u2014
p131
aVthe machine can still fly, albeit in a degraded fashion.
p132
aVWe're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Applause)
p135
aa(lp136
VThis last demonstration
p137
aVis an exploration of synthetic swarms.
p138
aVThe large number of autonomous, coordinated entities
p139
aVoffers a new palette for aesthetic expression.
p140
aVWe've taken commercially available micro quadcopters,
p141
aVeach weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way,
p142
aVand outfitted them with our localization technology
p143
aVand custom algorithms.
p144
aVBecause each unit knows where it is in space
p145
aVand is self-controlled,
p146
aVthere is really no limit to their number.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Applause)
p149
aa(lp150
V(Applause)
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VHopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up
p155
aVnew revolutionary roles for flying machines.
p156
aVThat ultrasafe one over there for example
p157
aVhas aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VThe reality is that it is difficult to predict
p162
aVthe impact of nascent technology.
p163
aVAnd for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation.
p164
aVIt's a continual reminder
p165
aVof how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is,
p166
aVthat it allows creative, clever creatures
p167
aVto sculpt it in such spectacular ways.
p168
aVThe fact that this technology
p169
aVhas such huge commercial and economic potential
p170
aVis just icing on the cake.
p171
aa(lp172
VThank you.

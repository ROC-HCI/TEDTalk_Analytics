VSomeone who looks like me walks past you in the street.
p5
aVDo you think they're a mother,
p6
aVa refugee
p7
aVor a victim of oppression?
p8
aVOr do you think they're a cardiologist,
p9
aVa barrister
p10
aVor maybe your local politician?
p11
aVDo you look me up and down,
p12
aVwondering how hot I must get
p13
aVor if my husband has forced me to wear this outfit?
p14
aVWhat if I wore my scarf like this?
p15
aa(lp16
VI can walk down the street in the exact same outfit
p17
aVand what the world expects of me and the way I'm treated
p18
aVdepends on the arrangement of this piece of cloth.
p19
aVBut this isn't going to be another monologue about the hijab
p20
aVbecause Lord knows, Muslim women are so much more than the piece of cloth
p21
aVthey choose, or not, to wrap their head in.
p22
aVThis is about looking beyond your bias.
p23
aa(lp24
VWhat if I walked past you and later on
p25
aVyou'd found out that actually I was a race car engineer,
p26
aVand that I designed my own race car and I ran my university's race team,
p27
aVbecause it's true.
p28
aVWhat if I told you that I was actually trained as a boxer for five years,
p29
aVbecause that's true, too.
p30
aVWould it surprise you?
p31
aVWhy?
p32
aa(lp33
VLadies and gentlemen, ultimately,
p34
aVthat surprise and the behaviors associated with it
p35
aVare the product of something  called unconscious bias,
p36
aVor implicit prejudice.
p37
aVAnd that results in the ridiculously detrimental
p38
aVlack of diversity in our workforce,
p39
aVparticularly in areas of influence.
p40
aVHello, Australian Federal Cabinet.
p41
aV(Applause)
p42
aa(lp43
VLet me just set something out from the outset:
p44
aVUnconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination.
p45
aVI'm not saying that in all of you,  there's a secret sexist or racist
p46
aVor ageist lurking within,  waiting to get out.
p47
aVThat's not what I'm saying.
p48
aVWe all have our biases.
p49
aVThey're the filters through which we see the world around us.
p50
aVI'm not accusing anyone,
p51
aVbias is not an accusation.
p52
aVRather, it's something that  has to be identified,
p53
aVacknowledged and mitigated against.
p54
aVBias can be about race,
p55
aVit can be about gender.
p56
aVIt can also be about class, education, disability.
p57
aVThe fact is, we all have biases against what's different,
p58
aVwhat's different to our social norms.
p59
aa(lp60
VThe thing is, if we want  to live in a world
p61
aVwhere the circumstances of your birth
p62
aVdo not dictate your future
p63
aVand where equal opportunity is ubiquitous,
p64
aVthen each and every one of us has a role to play
p65
aVin making sure unconscious bias does not determine our lives.
p66
aa(lp67
VThere's this really famous experiment in the space of unconscious bias
p68
aVand that's in the space of gender in the 1970s and 1980s.
p69
aVSo orchestras, back in the day, were made up mostly of dudes,
p70
aVup to only five percent were female.
p71
aVAnd apparently, that was because men played it differently,
p72
aVpresumably better, presumably.
p73
aVBut in 1952, The Boston Symphony Orchestra
p74
aVstarted an experiment.
p75
aVThey started blind auditions.
p76
aVSo rather than face-to-face auditions, you would have to play behind a screen.
p77
aVNow funnily enough,
p78
aVno immediate change was registered
p79
aVuntil they asked the audition-ers to take their shoes off
p80
aVbefore they entered the room.
p81
aVbecause the clickity-clack  of the heels
p82
aVagainst the hardwood floors
p83
aVwas enough to give the ladies away.
p84
aVNow get this,
p85
aVthere results of the audition showed
p86
aVthat there was a 50 percent increased chance
p87
aVa woman would progress past the preliminary stage.
p88
aVAnd it almost tripled  their chances of getting in.
p89
aVWhat does that tell us?
p90
aVWell, unfortunately for the guys, men actually didn't play differently,
p91
aVbut there was the perception that they did.
p92
aVAnd it was that bias that was determining their outcome.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo what we're doing here  is identifying and acknowledging
p95
aVthat a bias exists.
p96
aVAnd look, we all do it.
p97
aVLet me give you an example.
p98
aVA son and his father are in  a horrible car accident.
p99
aVThe father dies on impact
p100
aVand the son, who's severely injured, is rushed to hospital.
p101
aVThe surgeon looks at the son when they arrive and is like,
p102
aV"I can't operate."
p103
aVWhy?
p104
aV"The boy is my son."
p105
aVHow can that be?
p106
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p107
aVthe surgeon is his mother.
p108
aVNow hands up \u2014 and it's okay \u2014
p109
aVbut hands up if you initially assumed the surgeon was a guy?
p110
aVThere's evidence that that unconscious bias exists,
p111
aVbut we all just have to acknowledge that it's there
p112
aVand then look at ways  that we can move past it
p113
aVso that we can look at solutions.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow one of the interesting things
p116
aVaround the space of unconscious bias is the topic of quotas.
p117
aVAnd this something  that's often brought up.
p118
aVAnd of of the criticisms  is this idea of merit.
p119
aVLook, I don't want to be picked  because I'm a chick,
p120
aVI want to be picked because  I have merit,
p121
aVbecause I'm the best person for the job.
p122
aVIt's a sentiment that's pretty common among female engineers
p123
aVthat I work with and that I know.
p124
aVAnd yeah, I get it, I've been there.
p125
aVBut, if the merit idea was true,
p126
aVwhy would identical resumes,  in an experiment done in 2012 by Yale,
p127
aVidentical resumes sent out for a lab technician,
p128
aVwhy would Jennifers be deemed less competent,
p129
aVbe less likely to be offered the job,
p130
aVand be paid less than Johns.
p131
aVThe unconscious bias is there,
p132
aVbut we just have to look at how we can move past it.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd, you know, it's interesting,
p135
aVthere's some research that talks about
p136
aVwhy this is the case and it's called the merit paradox.
p137
aVAnd in organizations \u2014 and this is kind of ironic \u2014
p138
aVin organizations that talk about merit being their primary value-driver
p139
aVin terms of who they hire,
p140
aVthey were more likely to hire dudes and more likely to pay the guys more
p141
aVbecause apparently merit  is a masculine quality.
p142
aVBut, hey.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo you guys think you've got  a good read on me,
p145
aVyou kinda think you know what's up.
p146
aVCan you imagine me running one of these?
p147
aVCan you imagine me walking in and being like,
p148
aV"Hey boys, this is what's up. This is how it's done."
p149
aVWell, I'm glad you can.
p150
aV(Applause)
p151
aVBecause ladies and gentlemen, that's my day job.
p152
aVAnd the cool thing about it is that it's pretty entertaining.
p153
aVActually, in places like Malaysia,
p154
aVMuslim women on rigs  isn't even comment-worthy.
p155
aVThere are that many of them.
p156
aVBut, it is entertaining.
p157
aa(lp158
VI remember, I was telling one of the guys,
p159
aV"Hey, mate, look, I really want  to learn how to surf."
p160
aVAnd he's like, "Yassmin, I don't know how you can surf
p161
aVwith all that gear you've got on,
p162
aVand I don't know any women-only beaches."
p163
aVAnd then, the guy came up  with a brilliant idea,
p164
aVhe was like, "I know, you run that organization
p165
aVYouth Without Borders, right?
p166
aVWhy don't you start a clothing line for Muslim chicks in beaches.
p167
aVYou can call it  Youth Without Boardshorts."
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aVAnd I was like, "Thanks, guys."
p170
aVAnd I remember another bloke  telling me that
p171
aVI should eat all the yogurt I could
p172
aVbecause that was the only culture  I was going to get around there.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut, the problem is, it's kind of true
p175
aVbecause there's an intense  lack of diversity in our workforce,
p176
aVparticularly in places of influence.
p177
aVNow, in 2010,
p178
aVThe Australian National University did an experiment
p179
aVwhere they sent out 4,000 identical applications
p180
aVto entry level jobs, essentially.
p181
aVTo get the same number of interviews as someone with an Anglo-Saxon name,
p182
aVif you were Chinese, you had  to send out 68 percent more applications.
p183
aVIf you were Middle Eastern \u2014 Abdel-Magied \u2014
p184
aVyou had to send out 64 percent,
p185
aVand if you're Italian,  you're pretty lucky,
p186
aVyou only have to send out 12 percent more.
p187
aVIn places like Silicon Valley, it's not that much better.
p188
aVIn Google, they put out  some diversity results
p189
aVand 61 percent white, 30 percent Asian and nine, a bunch of blacks, Hispanics,
p190
aVall that kind of thing.
p191
aVAnd the rest of the tech world is not that much better
p192
aVand they've acknowledged it,
p193
aVbut I'm not really sure what they're doing about it.
p194
aa(lp195
VThe thing is, it doesn't trickle up.
p196
aVIn a study done by Green Park,
p197
aVwho are a British senior exec supplier,
p198
aVthey said that over half of the FTSE 100 companies
p199
aVdon't have a nonwhite leader at their board level,
p200
aVexecutive or non-executive.
p201
aVAnd two out of every three don't have an executive
p202
aVwho's from a minority.
p203
aVAnd most of the minorities  that are at that sort of level
p204
aVare non-executive board directors.
p205
aVSo their influence isn't that great.
p206
aa(lp207
VI've told you a bunch of terrible things.
p208
aVYou're like, "Oh my god, how bad is that? What can I do about it?"
p209
aVWell, fortunately,
p210
aVwe've identified that there's a problem.
p211
aVThere's a lack of opportunity, and that's due to unconscious bias.
p212
aVBut you might be sitting  there thinking,
p213
aV"I ain't brown. What's that got to do with me?"
p214
aVLet me offer you a solution.
p215
aVAnd as I've said before,
p216
aVwe live in a world where we're looking for an ideal.
p217
aVAnd if we want to create a world
p218
aVwhere the circumstances of your birth don't matter,
p219
aVwe all have to be part of the solution.
p220
aVAnd interestingly, the author of the lab resume experiment
p221
aVoffered some sort of a solution.
p222
aVShe said the one thing that brought the successful women together,
p223
aVthe one thing that they had in common,
p224
aVwas the fact that they had good mentors.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo mentoring, we've all kind of heard that before,
p227
aVit's in the vernacular.
p228
aVHere's another challenge for you.
p229
aVI challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different.
p230
aVThink about it.
p231
aVEveryone wants to mentor someone who kind of is familiar,
p232
aVwho looks like us,
p233
aVwe have shared experiences.
p234
aVIf I see a Muslim chick  who's got a bit of attitude,
p235
aVI'm like, "What's up? We can hang out."
p236
aVYou walk into a room and there's someone who went to the same school,
p237
aVyou play the same sports,
p238
aVthere's a high chance that you're going to want to help that person out.
p239
aVBut for the person in the room who has no shared experiences with you
p240
aVit becomes extremely difficult  to find that connection.
p241
aa(lp242
VThe idea of finding someone  different to mentor,
p243
aVsomeone who doesn't come from the same background as you,
p244
aVwhatever that background is,
p245
aVis about opening doors  for people who couldn't even get
p246
aVto the damn hallway.
p247
aa(lp248
VBecause ladies and gentlemen, the world is not just.
p249
aVPeople are not born  with equal opportunity.
p250
aVI was born in one of the poorest cities in the world, Khartoum.
p251
aVI was born brown, I was born female,
p252
aVand I was born Muslim in a world that is pretty suspicious of us
p253
aVfor reasons I can't control.
p254
aVHowever, I also acknowledge the fact that I was born with privilege.
p255
aVI was born with amazing parents,
p256
aVI was given an education
p257
aVand had the blessing of migrating to Australia.
p258
aVBut also, I've been blessed with amazing mentors
p259
aVwho've opened doors for me  that I didn't even know were there.
p260
aVA mentor who said to me,
p261
aV"Hey, your story's interesting.
p262
aVLet's write something about it so that I can share it with people."
p263
aVA mentor who said,
p264
aV"I know you're all those things that don't belong on an Australian rig,
p265
aVbut come on anyway."
p266
aVAnd here I am, talking to you.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd I'm not the only one.
p269
aVThere's all sorts of people in my communities
p270
aVthat I see have been helped out by mentors.
p271
aVA young Muslim man in Sydney
p272
aVwho ended up using his mentor's help
p273
aVto start up a poetry slam in Bankstown
p274
aVand now it's a huge thing.
p275
aVAnd he's able to change the lives of so many other young people.
p276
aVOr a lady here in Brisbane,
p277
aVan Afghan lady who's a refugee,
p278
aVwho could barely speak English when she came to Australia,
p279
aVher mentors helped her become a doctor
p280
aVand she took our Young Queenslander  of the Year Award in 2008.
p281
aVShe's an inspiration.
p282
aVThis is so not smooth.
p283
aa(lp284
VThis is me.
p285
aVBut I'm also the woman in the rig clothes,
p286
aVand I'm also the woman who was in the abaya at the beginning.
p287
aVWould you have chosen to mentor me if you had seen me
p288
aVin one of those other versions of who I am?
p289
aVBecause I'm that same person.
p290
aVWe have to look past our unconscious bias,
p291
aVfind someone to mentor who's at the opposite end of your spectrum
p292
aVbecause structural change takes time,
p293
aVand I don't have that level of patience.
p294
aVSo if we're going to create a change,
p295
aVif we're going to create a world
p296
aVwhere we all have those kinds of opportunities,
p297
aVthen choose to open doors for people.
p298
aVBecause you might think that diversity has nothing to do with you,
p299
aVbut we are all part of this system
p300
aVand we can all be part of that solution.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd if you don't know where to find someone different,
p303
aVgo to the places you wouldn't usually go.
p304
aVIf you enroll in private high school tutoring,
p305
aVgo to your local state school
p306
aVor maybe just drop into your local refugee tutoring center.
p307
aVOr perhaps you work at an office.
p308
aVTake out that new grad who looks totally out of place \u2014
p309
aV'cause that was me \u2014
p310
aVand open doors for them,
p311
aVnot in a tokenistic way, because we're not victims,
p312
aVbut show them the opportunities
p313
aVbecause opening up your world
p314
aVwill make you realize that  you have access to doors
p315
aVthat they didn't even know existed
p316
aVand you didn't even know they didn't have.
p317
aa(lp318
VLadies and gentlemen,
p319
aVthere is a problem in our community with lack of opportunity,
p320
aVespecially due to unconscious bias.
p321
aVBut each and every one one of you has the potential to change that.
p322
aVI know you've been given a lot of challenges today,
p323
aVbut if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently,
p324
aVbecause diversity is magic.
p325
aVAnd I encourage you to look past your initial perceptions
p326
aVbecause I bet you,
p327
aVthey're probably wrong.
p328
aa(lp329
VThank you.

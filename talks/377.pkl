VThis session is on natural wonders,
p5
aVand the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness.
p6
aVI want to try to combine them all,
p7
aVbecause to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder.
p8
aVYour body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself,
p9
aVand much more quickly than people had once realized,
p10
aVif you simply stop doing what\u2019s causing the problem.
p11
aVAnd so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general
p12
aVis focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet.
p13
aa(lp14
VI love doing this work, because it really gives many people
p15
aVnew hope and new choices that they didn\u2019t have before,
p16
aVand it allows us to talk about things that \u2014 not just diet,
p17
aVbut that happiness is not \u2014
p18
aVwe're talking about the pursuit of happiness,
p19
aVbut when you really look at all the spiritual traditions,
p20
aVwhat Aldous Huxley called the "perennial wisdom,"
p21
aVwhen you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people,
p22
aVit\u2019s really about \u2014 our nature is to be happy;
p23
aVour nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy.
p24
aVAnd so it\u2019s not something \u2014 happiness is not something you get,
p25
aVhealth is generally not something that you get.
p26
aVBut rather all of these different practices \u2014
p27
aVyou know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns
p28
aVdidn\u2019t develop these techniques to just manage stress
p29
aVor lower your blood pressure, unclog your arteries,
p30
aVeven though it can do all those things.
p31
aVThey\u2019re powerful tools for transformation,
p32
aVfor quieting down our mind and bodies
p33
aVto allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy,
p34
aVto be peaceful, to be joyful
p35
aVand to realize that it\u2019s not something that you pursue and get,
p36
aVbut rather it\u2019s something that you have already until you disturb it.
p37
aa(lp38
VI studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda
p39
aVand people would say, "What are you, a Hindu?" He\u2019d say, "No, I\u2019m an undo."
p40
aVAnd it\u2019s really about identifying what\u2019s causing us
p41
aVto disturb our innate health and happiness,
p42
aVand then to allow that natural healing to occur.
p43
aVTo me, that\u2019s the real natural wonder.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, within that larger context,
p46
aVwe can talk about diet, stress management \u2014
p47
aVwhich are really these spiritual practices \u2014
p48
aVmoderate exercise, smoking cessation, support groups and community \u2014
p49
aVwhich I\u2019ll talk more about \u2014 and some vitamins and supplements.
p50
aVAnd it\u2019s not a diet.
p51
aVYou know, when most people think about the diet I recommend,
p52
aVthey think it\u2019s a really strict diet.
p53
aVFor reversing disease, that\u2019s what it takes,
p54
aVbut if you\u2019re just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices.
p55
aVAnd to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction,
p56
aVyou\u2019re going to live longer, you\u2019re going to feel better,
p57
aVyou\u2019re going to lose weight, and so on.
p58
aVAnd in our studies, what we\u2019ve been able to do
p59
aVis to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures
p60
aVto prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost \u2014
p61
aVand in many ways, ancient \u2014 interventions, can be.
p62
aa(lp63
VWe first began by looking at heart disease,
p64
aVand when I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago,
p65
aVit was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse.
p66
aVAnd what we found was that, instead of getting worse and worse,
p67
aVin many cases it could get better and better,
p68
aVand much more quickly than people had once realized.
p69
aa(lp70
VThis is a representative patient who at the time was 73 \u2014
p71
aVtotally needed to have a bypass, decided to do this instead.
p72
aVWe used quantitative arteriography, showing the narrowing.
p73
aVThis is one of the arteries that feed the heart, one of the main arteries,
p74
aVand you can see the narrowing here.
p75
aVA year later, it\u2019s not as clogged; normally, it goes the other direction.
p76
aVThese minor changes in blockages
p77
aVcaused a 300 percent improvement in blood flow,
p78
aVand using cardiac positron emission tomography, or "PET," scans,
p79
aVblue and black is no blood flow, orange and white is maximal.
p80
aa(lp81
VHuge differences can occur without drugs, without surgery.
p82
aVClinically, he literally couldn\u2019t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain;
p83
aVwithin a month, like most people, was pain-free, and within a year,
p84
aVclimbing more than 100 floors a day on a Stairmaster.
p85
aVThis is not unusual, and it\u2019s part of what enables people
p86
aVto maintain these kinds of changes,
p87
aVbecause it makes such a big difference in their quality of life.
p88
aVOverall, if you looked at all the arteries in all the patients,
p89
aVthey got worse and worse, from one year to five years, in the comparison group.
p90
aVThis is the natural history of heart disease,
p91
aVbut it\u2019s really not natural because we found it could get better and better,
p92
aVand much more quickly than people had once thought.
p93
aVWe also found that the more people change, the better they got.
p94
aVIt wasn\u2019t a function of how old or how sick they were \u2014
p95
aVit was mainly how much they changed,
p96
aVand the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones.
p97
aa(lp98
VI got this as a Christmas card a few years ago
p99
aVfrom two of the patients in one of our programs.
p100
aVThe younger brother is 86, the older one\u2019s 95;
p101
aVthey wanted to show me how much more flexible they were.
p102
aVAnd the following year they sent me this one, which I thought was kind of funny.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVYou just never know.
p105
aVAnd what we found was that 99 percent of the patients
p106
aVstart to reverse the progression of their heart disease.
p107
aVNow I thought, you know, if we just did good science,
p108
aVthat would change medical practice. But, that was a little naive.
p109
aVIt\u2019s important, but not enough.
p110
aVBecause we doctors do what we get paid to do,
p111
aVand we get trained to do what we get paid to do,
p112
aVso if we change insurance, then we change medical practice and medical education.
p113
aVInsurance will cover the bypass, it\u2019ll cover the angioplasty;
p114
aVit won\u2019t, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, we began through our nonprofit institute's
p117
aVtraining hospitals around the country,
p118
aVand we found that most people could avoid surgery,
p119
aVand not only was it medically effective, it was also cost effective.
p120
aVAnd the insurance companies found
p121
aVthat they began to save almost 30,000 dollars per patient,
p122
aVand Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project
p123
aVwhere they\u2019re paying for 1,800 people to go through the program
p124
aVon the sites that we train.
p125
aVThe fortuneteller says, "I give smokers a discount
p126
aVbecause there\u2019s not as much to tell." (Laughter)
p127
aVI like this slide, because it\u2019s a chance to talk about
p128
aVwhat really motivates people to change, and what doesn\u2019t.
p129
aVAnd what doesn\u2019t work is fear of dying,
p130
aVand that\u2019s what\u2019s normally used.
p131
aa(lp132
VEverybody who smokes knows it\u2019s not good for you,
p133
aVand still 30 percent of Americans smoke \u2014
p134
aV80 percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it?
p135
aVWell, because it helps them get through the day.
p136
aVAnd I\u2019ll talk more about this, but the real epidemic
p137
aVisn\u2019t just heart disease or obesity or smoking \u2014 it\u2019s loneliness and depression.
p138
aVAs one woman said, "I\u2019ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes,
p139
aVand they\u2019re always there for me and nobody else is.
p140
aVYou\u2019re going to take away my 20 friends? What are you going to give me?"
p141
aVOr they eat when they get depressed,
p142
aVor they use alcohol to numb the pain,
p143
aVor they work too hard, or watch too much TV.
p144
aVThere are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain,
p145
aVbut the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem.
p146
aVAnd the pain is not the problem: it\u2019s the symptom.
p147
aVAnd telling people they\u2019re going to die is too scary to think about,
p148
aVor, they\u2019re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary,
p149
aVand so they don\u2019t want to think about it, so they don\u2019t.
p150
aa(lp151
VThe most effective anti-smoking ad was this one.
p152
aVYou\u2019ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth,
p153
aVand "impotence" \u2014 the headline is, "Impotent" \u2014 it\u2019s not emphysema.
p154
aVWhat was the biggest selling drug of all time
p155
aVwhen it was introduced a few years ago?
p156
aVViagra, right? Why? Because a lot of guys need it.
p157
aVIt\u2019s not like you say, "Hey Joe, I\u2019m having erectile dysfunction, how about you?"
p158
aVAnd yet, look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold.
p159
aVIt\u2019s not so much psychological, it\u2019s vascular,
p160
aVand nicotine makes your arteries constrict.
p161
aVSo does cocaine, so does a high fat diet, so does emotional stress.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture
p164
aVare the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired,
p165
aVlethargic, depressed and impotent, and that\u2019s not much fun.
p166
aVBut when you change those behaviors, your brain gets more blood,
p167
aVyou think more clearly, you have more energy,
p168
aVyour heart gets more blood in ways I\u2019ve shown you.
p169
aVYour sexual function improves.
p170
aVAnd these things occur within hours. This is a study: a high fat meal,
p171
aVand within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less \u2014
p172
aVand you\u2019ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving.
p173
aVWhen you eat a big fatty meal, how do you feel?
p174
aVYou feel kind of sleepy afterwards.
p175
aVOn a low-fat meal, the blood flow doesn\u2019t go down \u2014 it even goes up.
p176
aVMany of you have kids, and you know that\u2019s a big change in your lifestyle,
p177
aVand so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they\u2019re worth it.
p178
aVAnd the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits,
p179
aVand you feel so much better so quickly.
p180
aVFor many people, those are choices worth making \u2014
p181
aVnot to live longer, but to live better.
p182
aa(lp183
VI want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic,
p184
aVbecause it really is a problem.
p185
aVTwo-thirds of adults are overweight or obese,
p186
aVand diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds
p187
aVhas increased 70 percent in the last 10 years. It\u2019s no joke: it\u2019s real.
p188
aVAnd just to show you this, this is from the CDC.
p189
aVThese are not election returns; these are the percentage of people who are overweight.
p190
aVAnd if you see from '85 to '86 to '87, '88, '89, '90, '91 \u2014
p191
aVyou get a new category, 15 to 20 percent; '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97 \u2014
p192
aVyou get a new category; '98, '99, 2000, and 2001.
p193
aVMississippi, more than 25 percent of people are overweight.
p194
aVWhy is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well ...
p195
aVbut it doesn\u2019t last, which is the problem.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, there\u2019s no mystery in how you lose weight;
p200
aVyou either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories.
p201
aVNow, one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food,
p202
aVwhich is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food,
p203
aVor if you restrict entire categories of foods.
p204
aVBut the problem is, you get hungry, so it\u2019s hard to keep it off.
p205
aVThe other way is to change the type of food.
p206
aVAnd fat has nine calories per gram,
p207
aVwhereas protein and carbs only have four.
p208
aVSo, when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food.
p209
aVSo you can eat the same amount of food, but you\u2019ll be getting fewer calories
p210
aVbecause the food is less dense in calories.
p211
aVAnd it\u2019s the volume of food that affects satiety, rather than the type of food.
p212
aa(lp213
VYou know, I don\u2019t like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it every day,
p214
aVand so I just thought I\u2019d spend a few minutes on that.
p215
aVThe myth that you hear about is,
p216
aVAmericans have been told to eat less fat,
p217
aVthe percent of calories from fat is down,
p218
aVAmericans are fatter than ever, therefore fat doesn\u2019t make you fat.
p219
aVIt\u2019s a half-truth. Actually, Americans are eating more fat than ever,
p220
aVand even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower,
p221
aVthe actual amount is higher, and so the goal is to reduce both.
p222
aVDr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died,
p223
aVand we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs,
p224
aVthe "bad carbs," and these are things like \u2014
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aV\u2014 sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol. And you get a double whammy:
p227
aVyou get all these calories that don\u2019t fill you up because you\u2019ve removed the fiber,
p228
aVand they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up.
p229
aVYour pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good.
p230
aVBut insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat.
p231
aVSo, the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages \u2014
p232
aVthese are not health foods \u2014
p233
aVbut to go from "bad carbs" to what are called "good carbs."
p234
aVAnd these are things like whole foods, or unrefined carbs:
p235
aVfruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice, in their natural forms, are rich in fiber.
p236
aVAnd the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories,
p237
aVand it slows the absorption so you don\u2019t get that rapid rise in blood sugar.
p238
aVSo, and you get all the disease-protective substances.
p239
aa(lp240
VIt\u2019s not just what you exclude from your diet,
p241
aVbut also what you include that\u2019s protective.
p242
aVJust as all carbs are not bad for you, all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats.
p243
aVAnd these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids.
p244
aVYou find these, for example, in fish oil.
p245
aVAnd the bad fats are things like trans-fatty acids and processed food
p246
aVand saturated fats, which we find in meat.
p247
aVIf you don\u2019t remember anything else from this talk,
p248
aVthree grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack
p249
aVand sudden death by 50 to 80 percent.
p250
aVThree grams a day. They come in one-gram capsules;
p251
aVmore than that just gives you extra fat you don\u2019t need.
p252
aVIt also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers
p253
aVlike breast, prostate and colon cancer.
p254
aVNow, the problem with the Atkins diet,
p255
aVeverybody knows people who have lost weight on it,
p256
aVbut you can lose weight on amphetamines, you know, and fen-phen.
p257
aVI mean, there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren\u2019t good for you.
p258
aVYou want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health
p259
aVrather than the one that harms it.
p260
aVAnd the problem is that it\u2019s based on this half-truth,
p261
aVwhich is that Americans eat too many simple carbs,
p262
aVso if you eat fewer simple carbs you\u2019re going to lose weight.
p263
aVYou\u2019ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat,
p264
aVand you\u2019ll enhance your health rather than harming it.
p265
aVHe says, "I\u2019ve got some good news.
p266
aVWhile your cholesterol level has remained the same,
p267
aVthe research findings have changed."
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VNow, what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet?
p272
aVThe red is good at the beginning, and a year later \u2014
p273
aVthis is from a study done in a peer-reviewed journal called Angiology \u2014
p274
aVthere\u2019s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend,
p275
aVthere\u2019s less red, less blood flow after a year on an Atkins-type diet.
p276
aVSo, yes, you can lose weight, but your heart isn\u2019t happy.
p277
aVNow, one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center
p278
aVfound that 70 percent of the people were constipated, 65 percent had bad breath,
p279
aV54 percent had headaches \u2013 this is not a healthy way to eat.
p280
aVAnd so, you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you,
p281
aVbut when they get too close it\u2019s going to be a problem.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd more seriously, there are case reports now of 16-year-old girls
p286
aVwho died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet \u2014
p287
aVof bone disease, kidney disease, and so on.
p288
aVAnd that\u2019s how your body excretes waste, is through your breath,
p289
aVyour bowels and your perspiration.
p290
aVSo when you go on these kinds of diet, they begin to smell bad.
p291
aVSo, an optimal diet is low in fat, low in the bad carbs,
p292
aVhigh in the good carbs and enough of the good fats.
p293
aVAnd then, again, it\u2019s a spectrum:
p294
aVwhen you move in this direction, you\u2019re going to lose weight,
p295
aVyou\u2019re going to feel better and you\u2019re going to gain health.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow, there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too,
p298
aVwhether it\u2019s the deforestation of the Amazon, or making more protein available,
p299
aVto the four billion people who live on a dollar a day \u2014
p300
aVnot to mention whatever ethical concerns people have.
p301
aVSo, there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow, we\u2019re about to publish the first study
p304
aVlooking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer,
p305
aVand, in collaboration with Sloane-Kettering and with UCSF.
p306
aVWe took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer
p307
aVand who had elected, for reasons unrelated to the study, not to have surgery.
p308
aVWe could randomly divide them into two groups,
p309
aVand then we could have one group
p310
aVthat is a non-intervention control group to compare to,
p311
aVwhich we can\u2019t do with, say, breast cancer, because everyone gets treated.
p312
aa(lp313
VWhat we found was that, after a year,
p314
aVnone of the experimental group patients
p315
aVwho made these lifestyle changes needed treatment,
p316
aVwhereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation.
p317
aVWhen we looked at their PSA levels \u2014 which is a marker for prostate cancer \u2014
p318
aVthey got worse in the control group,
p319
aVbut they actually got better in the experimental group,
p320
aVand these differences were highly significant.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd then I wondered: was there any relationship
p323
aVbetween how much people changed their diet and lifestyle \u2014
p324
aVwhichever group they were in \u2014 and the changes in PSA?
p325
aVAnd sure enough, we found a dose-response relationship,
p326
aVjust like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies.
p327
aVAnd in order for the PSA to go down, they had to make pretty big changes.
p328
aa(lp329
VI then wondered, well, maybe they\u2019re just changing their PSA,
p330
aVbut it\u2019s not really affecting the tumor growth.
p331
aVSo we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA;
p332
aVthey added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture,
p333
aVand it inhibited the growth seven times more
p334
aVin the experimental group than in the control group \u2014 70 versus 9 percent.
p335
aVAnd finally, I said, I wonder if there\u2019s any relationship between
p336
aVhow much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth,
p337
aVwhichever group they happened to be in.
p338
aVAnd this really got me excited because again,
p339
aVwe found the same pattern: the more people change,
p340
aVthe more it affected the growth of their tumors.
p341
aVAnd finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients,
p342
aVand the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient,
p343
aVand you can see clearly it\u2019s better a year later, along with the PSA going down.
p344
aVSo, if it\u2019s true for prostate cancer, it\u2019ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well.
p345
aVAnd whether or not you have conventional treatment,
p346
aVin addition, if you make these changes, it may help reduce the risk of recurrence.
p347
aa(lp348
VThe last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness,
p349
aVis that study after study have shown
p350
aVthat people who are lonely and depressed \u2014
p351
aVand depression is the other real epidemic in our culture \u2014
p352
aVare many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely,
p353
aVin part because, as we talked about, they\u2019re more likely to smoke
p354
aVand overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on.
p355
aVBut also, through mechanisms that we don\u2019t fully understand,
p356
aVpeople who are lonely and depressed are many times \u2014
p357
aVthree to five to ten times, in some studies \u2014
p358
aVmore likely to get sick and die prematurely.
p359
aVAnd depression is treatable. We need to do something about that.
p360
aa(lp361
VNow, on the other hand, anything that promotes intimacy is healing.
p362
aVIt can be sexual intimacy \u2013
p363
aVI happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy
p364
aVare just different forms of the same thing.
p365
aVFriendship, altruism, compassion, service \u2013 all the perennial truths that we talked about
p366
aVthat are part of all religion and all cultures \u2014
p367
aVonce you stop trying to see the differences,
p368
aVthese are the things in our own self-interest,
p369
aVbecause they free us from our suffering and from disease.
p370
aVAnd it\u2019s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do.
p371
aa(lp372
VJust take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford.
p373
aVHe took women with metastatic breast cancer,
p374
aVrandomly divided them into two groups.
p375
aVOne group of people just met for an hour-and-a-half once a week in a support group.
p376
aVIt was a nurturing, loving environment,
p377
aVwhere they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses
p378
aVand talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer
p379
aVwith people who understood, because they were going through it too.
p380
aVThey just met once a week for a year.
p381
aVFive years later, those women lived twice as long, and you can see that the people \u2014
p382
aVand that was the only difference between the groups.
p383
aVIt was a randomized control study published in The Lancet.
p384
aVOther studies have shown this as well.
p385
aVSo, these simple things that create intimacy are really healing,
p386
aVand even the word healing, it comes from the root "to make whole."
p387
aVThe word yoga comes from the Sanskrit,
p388
aVmeaning "union, to yoke, to bring together."
p389
aa(lp390
VAnd the last slide I want to show you is from \u2014 I was \u2014 again,
p391
aVthis swami that I studied with for so many years, and I
p392
aVdid a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds
p393
aVat the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago.
p394
aVAnd at the end of it, somebody said,
p395
aV"Hey, Swami, what\u2019s the difference between wellness and illness?"
p396
aVAnd so he went up on the board and he wrote the word "illness,"
p397
aVand circled the first letter, and then wrote the word "wellness,"
p398
aVand circled the first two letters ...
p399
aVTo me, it\u2019s just shorthand for what we\u2019re talking about:
p400
aVthat anything that creates a sense of connection
p401
aVand community and love is really healing.
p402
aVAnd then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process.
p403
aVThank you. (Applause)

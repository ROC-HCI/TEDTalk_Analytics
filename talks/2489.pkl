VWill we do whatever it takes to tackle climate change?
p5
aa(lp6
VI come at this question not as a green campaigner,
p7
aVin fact, I confess to be rather hopeless at recycling.
p8
aVI come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making
p9
aVand someone that wonders how history will judge us.
p10
aa(lp11
VOne day,
p12
aVthis ring that belonged to my grandfather
p13
aVwill pass to my son, Charlie.
p14
aVAnd I wonder what his generation
p15
aVand perhaps the one that follows
p16
aVwill make of the two lives this ring has worked.
p17
aa(lp18
VMy grandfather was a coal miner.
p19
aVIn his time,
p20
aVburning fossil fuels for energy and for allowing economies to develop
p21
aVwas accepted.
p22
aVWe know now that that is not the case
p23
aVbecause of the greenhouse gases that coal produces.
p24
aVBut today,
p25
aVI fear it's the industry in which I work that will be judged more harshly
p26
aVbecause of its impact on the climate \u2014
p27
aVmore harshly than my grandfather's industry, even.
p28
aa(lp29
VI work, of course, in the banking industry,
p30
aVwhich will be remembered for its crisis in 2008 \u2014
p31
aVa crisis that diverted the attention and finances of governments
p32
aVaway from some really, really important promises,
p33
aVlike promises made at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009
p34
aVto mobilize 100 billion dollars a year
p35
aVto help developing countries move away from burning fossil fuels
p36
aVand transition to using cleaner energy.
p37
aVThat promise is already in jeopardy.
p38
aVAnd that's a real problem,
p39
aVbecause that transition to cleaner energy needs to happen
p40
aVsooner rather than later.
p41
aa(lp42
VFirstly,
p43
aVbecause greenhouse gases, once released,
p44
aVstay in the atmosphere for decades.
p45
aVAnd secondly,
p46
aVif a developing economy builds its power grid around fossil fuels today,
p47
aVit's going to be way more costly to change later on.
p48
aVSo for the climate,
p49
aVhistory may judge that the banking crisis happened
p50
aVat just the wrong time.
p51
aVThe story need not be this gloomy, though.
p52
aa(lp53
VThree years ago,
p54
aVI argued that governments could use the tools
p55
aVdeployed to save the financial system
p56
aVto meet other global challenges.
p57
aVAnd these arguments are getting stronger, not weaker, with time.
p58
aVLet's take a brief reminder of what those tools looked like.
p59
aa(lp60
VWhen the financial crisis hit in 2008,
p61
aVthe central banks of the US and UK
p62
aVbegan buying bonds issued by their own governments
p63
aVin a policy known as "quantitative easing."
p64
aVDepending on what happens to those bonds when they mature,
p65
aVthis is money printing by another name.
p66
aVAnd boy, did they print.
p67
aVThe US alone created four trillion dollars' worth of its own currency.
p68
aVThis was not done in isolation.
p69
aVIn a remarkable act of cooperation,
p70
aVthe 188 countries that make up the International Monetary Fund, the IMF,
p71
aVagreed to issue 250 billion dollars' worth of their own currency \u2014
p72
aVthe Special Drawing Right \u2014
p73
aVto boost reserves around the world.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhen the financial crisis moved to Europe,
p76
aVthe European Central Bank President, Mario Draghi,
p77
aVpromised "to do whatever it takes."
p78
aVAnd they did.
p79
aVThe Bank of Japan repeated those words \u2014 that exact same commitment \u2014
p80
aVto do "whatever it takes" to reflate their economy.
p81
aVIn both cases,
p82
aV"whatever it takes" meant trillions of dollars more
p83
aVin money-printing policies that continue today.
p84
aVWhat this shows
p85
aVis that when faced with some global challenges,
p86
aVpolicy makers are able to act collectively, with urgency,
p87
aVand run the risks of unconventional policies like money printing.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo, let's go back to that original question:
p90
aVCan we print money for climate finance?
p91
aVThree years ago,
p92
aVthe idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo.
p93
aVOnce you break down and dismantle the idea
p94
aVthat money is a finite resource,
p95
aVgovernments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people
p96
aVto print more and more money for other causes:
p97
aVeducation, health care, welfare \u2014
p98
aVeven defense.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing \u2014
p101
aVuncontrolled money printing \u2014
p102
aVleading to hyperinflation.
p103
aVThink: Weimar Republic in 1930;
p104
aVZimbabwe more recently, in 2008,
p105
aVwhen the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day.
p106
aVBut all of this is moving the public debate forward,
p107
aVso much so, that money printing for the people is now discussed openly
p108
aVin the financial media, and even in some political manifestos.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut it's important the debate doesn't stop here,
p111
aVwith printing national currencies.
p112
aVBecause climate change is a shared global problem,
p113
aVthere are some really compelling reasons
p114
aVwhy we should be printing that international currency
p115
aVthat's issued by the IMF,
p116
aVto fund it.
p117
aVThe Special Drawing Right, or SDR,
p118
aVis the IMF's electronic unit of account
p119
aVthat governments use to transfer funds amongst each other.
p120
aVThink of it as a peer-to-peer payment network,
p121
aVlike Bitcoin, but for governments.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd it's truly global.
p124
aVEach of the 188 members of the IMF hold SDR quotas
p125
aVas part of their foreign exchange reserves.
p126
aVThese are national stores of wealth
p127
aVthat countries keep to protect themselves against currency crises.
p128
aVAnd that global nature is why,
p129
aVat the height of the financial crisis in 2009,
p130
aVthe IMF issued those extra 250 billion dollars \u2014
p131
aVbecause it served as a collective global action
p132
aVthat safeguarded countries large and small in one fell swoop.
p133
aa(lp134
VBut here \u2014
p135
aVhere's the intriguing part.
p136
aVMore than half of those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009 \u2014
p137
aV150 billion dollars' worth \u2014
p138
aVwent to developed market countries who, for the most part,
p139
aVhave a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves,
p140
aVbecause they have flexible exchange rates.
p141
aVSo those extra reserves that were printed in 2009,
p142
aVin the end, for developed market countries at least,
p143
aVweren't really needed.
p144
aVAnd they remain unused today.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo here's an idea.
p147
aVAs a first step,
p148
aVwhy don't we start spending those unused,
p149
aVthose extra SDRs that were printed in 2009,
p150
aVto combat climate change?
p151
aa(lp152
VThey could, for example,
p153
aVbe used to buy bonds issued by the UN's Green Climate Fund.
p154
aVThis was a fund created in 2009,
p155
aVfollowing that climate agreement in Copenhagen.
p156
aVAnd it was designed to channel funds towards developing countries
p157
aVto meet their climate projects.
p158
aVIt's been one of the most successful funds of its type,
p159
aVraising almost 10 billion dollars.
p160
aVBut if we use those extra SDRs that were issued,
p161
aVit helps governments get back on track,
p162
aVto meet that promise of 100 billion dollars a year
p163
aVthat was derailed by the financial crisis.
p164
aa(lp165
VIt could also \u2014
p166
aVit could also serve as a test case.
p167
aVIf the inflationary consequences of using SDRs in this way are benign,
p168
aVit could be used to justify
p169
aVthe additional, extra issuance of SDRs, say, every five years,
p170
aVagain, with the commitment
p171
aVthat developed-market countries would direct their share
p172
aVof the new reserves
p173
aVto the Green Climate Fund.
p174
aa(lp175
VPrinting international money in this way has several advantages
p176
aVover printing national currencies.
p177
aVThe first is it's really easy to argue
p178
aVthat spending money to mitigate climate change benefits everyone.
p179
aVNo one section of society benefits from the printing press over another.
p180
aVThat problem of competing claims is mitigated.
p181
aVIt's also fair to say
p182
aVthat because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra SDRs,
p183
aVit's highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control.
p184
aVWhat you end up with is a collective, global action
p185
aVaimed \u2014 and it's controlled global action \u2014
p186
aVaimed at a global good.
p187
aVAnd,
p188
aVas we've learned with the money-printing schemes,
p189
aVwhatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo, for example,
p192
aVthe issuance of these extra SDRs every five years could be capped,
p193
aVsuch that this international currency is never more than five percent
p194
aVof global foreign exchange reserves.
p195
aVThat's important because it would allay
p196
aVwell, let's say, the ridiculous concerns that the US might have
p197
aVthat the SDR could ever challenge the dollar's dominant role
p198
aVin international finance.
p199
aVAnd in fact,
p200
aVI think the only thing that the SDR would likely steal from the dollar
p201
aVunder this scheme
p202
aVis its nickname, the "greenback."
p203
aVBecause even with that cap in place,
p204
aVthe IMF could have followed up its issuance \u2014
p205
aVits massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 \u2014
p206
aVwith a further 200 billion dollars of SDRs in 2014.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo hypothetically,
p209
aVthat would mean that developed countries could have contributed
p210
aVup to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs
p211
aVto the Green Climate Fund.
p212
aVThat's 30 times what it has today.
p213
aVAnd you know,
p214
aVas spectacular as that sounds,
p215
aVit's only just beginning to look like "whatever it takes."
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd just to think what amazing things could be done with that money,
p218
aVconsider this:
p219
aVin 2009,
p220
aVNorway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to Brazil
p221
aVif they followed through on their goals on deforestation.
p222
aVThat program has since delivered a 70 percent reduction in deforestation
p223
aVin the past decade.
p224
aVThat's saving 3.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions,
p225
aVwhich is the equivalent of taking all American cars off the roads
p226
aVfor three whole years.
p227
aVSo what could we do
p228
aVwith 300 other pay-for-performance climate projects like that,
p229
aVorganized on a global scale?
p230
aVWe could take cars off the roads for a generation.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo,
p233
aVlet's not quibble about whether we can afford to fund climate change.
p234
aVThe real question is:
p235
aVDo we care enough about future generations
p236
aVto take the very same policy risks we took to save the financial system?
p237
aVAfter all,
p238
aVwe could do it,
p239
aVwe did do it
p240
aVand we are doing it today.
p241
aa(lp242
VWe must, must, must do "whatever it takes."
p243
aa(lp244
VThank you.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Applause)

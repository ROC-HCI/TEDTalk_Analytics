VI'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort
p5
aVthat goes into making the headlines you see in the paper.
p6
aVHeadlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change;
p7
aVand like this when they have to do with air quality or smog.
p8
aVThey're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.
p9
aa(lp10
VRecently, the headlines looked like this
p11
aVwhen the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC,
p12
aVput out their report
p13
aVon the state of understanding of the atmospheric system.
p14
aVThat report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries.
p15
aVThey wrote almost 1,000 pages on the topic,
p16
aVand all of those pages were reviewed
p17
aVby another 400-plus scientists and reviewers
p18
aVfrom 113 countries.
p19
aVIt's a big community;
p20
aVsuch a big community, in fact,
p21
aVthat our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world.
p22
aa(lp23
VOver 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that.
p24
aVEvery one of those scientists is in a research group,
p25
aVand every research group studies a wide variety of topics.
p26
aVFor us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño Oscillation,
p27
aVwhich affects weather and climate,
p28
aVto the assimilation of satellite data,
p29
aVto emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I study.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more,
p32
aVthere are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics,
p33
aVthings as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules.
p34
aVAnd one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here.
p35
aVIt's a small organic molecule.
p36
aVYou've probably never heard of it.
p37
aVThe weight of a paper clip is approximately equal
p38
aVto 900 zeta-illion \u2014 10 to the 21st \u2014 molecules of isoprene.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut despite its very small weight,
p41
aVenough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year
p42
aVto equal the weight of all the people on the planet.
p43
aVIt's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane.
p44
aVAnd because it's so much stuff,
p45
aVit's really important for the atmospheric system.
p46
aa(lp47
VBecause it's important to the atmospheric system,
p48
aVwe go to all lengths to study this thing.
p49
aVWe blow it up and look at the pieces.
p50
aVThis is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.
p51
aVAtmospheric explosions, or full combustion,
p52
aVtakes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car.
p53
aVBut still, we look at the pieces.
p54
aa(lp55
VWe run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do.
p56
aVOur models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes
p57
aVcalculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales.
p58
aVIt takes weeks to perform our integrations,
p59
aVand we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening.
p60
aa(lp61
VWe also fly all over the world looking for this thing.
p62
aVI recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia \u2014 there are others.
p63
aVWe found a global atmospheric watchtower there
p64
aVin the middle of the rainforest,
p65
aVand hung hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of scientific equipment
p66
aVoff this tower,
p67
aVto look for isoprene and other things while we were there.
p68
aVThis is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above,
p69
aVand the tower from below.
p70
aa(lp71
VOn part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us.
p72
aVAnd this plane, the model BAe-146, which was run by FAAM,
p73
aVnormally flies 120 to 130 people,
p74
aVso maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today.
p75
aVBut we didn't just fly it.
p76
aVWe were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy
p77
aVto measure this molecule \u2014 incredibly dangerous stuff.
p78
aa(lp79
VWe have to fly at a special incline to make the measurements;
p80
aVwe hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering;
p81
aVwe need special flight clearance.
p82
aVAs you come around the banks in these valleys,
p83
aVthe forces can get up to two Gs;
p84
aVthe scientists must be completely harnessed in
p85
aVin order to make measurements while on board.
p86
aVSo as you can imagine,
p87
aVthe inside of the aircraft doesn't look like one you'd take on vacation.
p88
aVIt's a flying laboratory we took to make measurements of this molecule.
p89
aa(lp90
VWe do all this to understand the chemistry of one molecule.
p91
aVAnd when one student like me has some sort of inclination
p92
aVor understanding about that molecule,
p93
aVthey write one scientific paper on the subject.
p94
aVAnd out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers
p95
aVon a few dozen processes or molecules.
p96
aa(lp97
VAs a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection,
p98
aVor one sub-subsection,
p99
aVof an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others.
p100
aVAnd each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.
p101
aVSo you can imagine the scale of the effort.
p102
aVIn each one of the assessments we write, we always tag on a summary,
p103
aVand the summary is written for a non-scientific audience.
p104
aVAnd we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers
p105
aVin order to make headlines like these.
p106
aa(lp107
VThank you very much.

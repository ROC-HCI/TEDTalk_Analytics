VNow this is a very un-TED-like thing to do,
p5
aVbut let's kick off the afternoon
p6
aVwith a message
p7
aVfrom a mystery sponsor.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnonymous: Dear Fox News,
p10
aVit has come to our unfortunate attention
p11
aVthat both the name and nature of Anonymous
p12
aVhas been ravaged.
p13
aVWe are everyone. We are no one.
p14
aVWe are anonymous. We are legion.
p15
aVWe do not forgive. We do not forget.
p16
aVWe are but the base of chaos.
p17
aa(lp18
VMisha Glenny: Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen \u2014
p19
aVa sophisticated group
p20
aVof politically motivated hackers
p21
aVwho have emerged in 2011.
p22
aVAnd they're pretty scary.
p23
aVYou never know when they're going to attack next,
p24
aVwho or what the consequences will be.
p25
aVBut interestingly,
p26
aVthey have a sense of humor.
p27
aVThese guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account
p28
aVto announce President Obama's assassination.
p29
aVNow you can imagine the panic that would have generated
p30
aVin the newsroom at Fox.
p31
aV"What do we do now?
p32
aVPut on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?"
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVAnd of course, who could escape the irony
p35
aVof a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
p36
aVbeing a victim of hacking for a change.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
V(Applause)
p41
aa(lp42
VSometimes you turn on the news
p43
aVand you say, "Is there anyone left to hack?"
p44
aVSony Playstation Network \u2014 done,
p45
aVthe government of Turkey \u2014 tick,
p46
aVBritain's Serious Organized Crime Agency \u2014 a breeze,
p47
aVthe CIA \u2014 falling off a log.
p48
aVIn fact, a friend of mine from the security industry
p49
aVtold me the other day
p50
aVthat there are two types of companies in the world:
p51
aVthose that know they've been hacked, and those that don't.
p52
aVI mean three companies
p53
aVproviding cybersecurity services to the FBI
p54
aVhave been hacked.
p55
aVIs nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake?
p56
aa(lp57
VAnyway, this mysterious group Anonymous \u2014
p58
aVand they would say this themselves \u2014
p59
aVthey are providing a service
p60
aVby demonstrating how useless companies are
p61
aVat protecting our data.
p62
aVBut there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous \u2014
p63
aVthey are ideologically driven.
p64
aVThey claim that they are battling
p65
aVa dastardly conspiracy.
p66
aVThey say that governments are trying
p67
aVto take over the Internet and control it,
p68
aVand that they, Anonymous,
p69
aVare the authentic voice of resistance \u2014
p70
aVbe it against Middle Eastern dictatorships,
p71
aVagainst global media corporations,
p72
aVor against intelligence agencies,
p73
aVor whoever it is.
p74
aVAnd their politics are not entirely unattractive.
p75
aVOkay, they're a little inchoate.
p76
aVThere's a strong whiff
p77
aVof half-baked anarchism about them.
p78
aVBut one thing is true:
p79
aVwe are at the beginning
p80
aVof a mighty struggle
p81
aVfor control of the Internet.
p82
aVThe Web links everything,
p83
aVand very soon
p84
aVit will mediate most human activity.
p85
aVBecause the Internet has fashioned
p86
aVa new and complicated environment
p87
aVfor an old-age dilemma
p88
aVthat pits the demands of security
p89
aVwith the desire for freedom.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow this is a very complicated struggle.
p92
aVAnd unfortunately, for mortals like you and me,
p93
aVwe probably can't understand it very well.
p94
aVNonetheless,
p95
aVin an unexpected attack of hubris
p96
aVa couple of years ago,
p97
aVI decided I would try and do that.
p98
aVAnd I sort of get it.
p99
aVThese were the various things that I was looking at
p100
aVas I was trying to understand it.
p101
aVBut in order to try and explain the whole thing,
p102
aVI would need another 18 minutes or so to do it,
p103
aVso you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion,
p104
aVand let me assure you that all of these issues
p105
aVare involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet
p106
aVone way or the other,
p107
aVbut in a configuration
p108
aVthat even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty
p109
aVtrying to get his head around.
p110
aVSo there you are.
p111
aVAnd as you see, in the middle,
p112
aVthere is our old friend, the hacker.
p113
aVThe hacker is absolutely central
p114
aVto many of the political, social
p115
aVand economic issues affecting the Net.
p116
aVAnd so I thought to myself,
p117
aV"Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to."
p118
aVAnd what do you know,
p119
aVnobody else does talk to the hackers.
p120
aVThey're completely anonymous, as it were.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo despite the fact
p123
aVthat we are beginning to pour billions,
p124
aVhundreds of billions of dollars,
p125
aVinto cybersecurity \u2014
p126
aVfor the most extraordinary technical solutions \u2014
p127
aVno one wants to talk
p128
aVto these guys, the hackers,
p129
aVwho are doing everything.
p130
aVInstead, we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions,
p131
aVwhich cost a huge amount of money.
p132
aVAnd so nothing is going into the hackers.
p133
aVWell, I say nothing,
p134
aVbut actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit
p135
aVin Turin, Italy
p136
aVcalled the Hackers Profiling Project.
p137
aVAnd they are doing some fantastic research
p138
aVinto the characteristics,
p139
aVinto the abilities
p140
aVand the socialization of hackers.
p141
aVBut because they're a U.N. operation,
p142
aVmaybe that's why governments and corporations
p143
aVare not that interested in them.
p144
aVBecause it's a U.N. operation,
p145
aVof course, it lacks funding.
p146
aVBut I think they're doing very important work.
p147
aVBecause where we have a surplus of technology
p148
aVin the cybersecurity industry,
p149
aVwe have a definite lack of \u2014
p150
aVcall me old-fashioned \u2014
p151
aVhuman intelligence.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, so far I've mentioned
p154
aVthe hackers Anonymous
p155
aVwho are a politically motivated hacking group.
p156
aVOf course, the criminal justice system
p157
aVtreats them as common old garden criminals.
p158
aVBut interestingly,
p159
aVAnonymous does not make use of its hacked information
p160
aVfor financial gain.
p161
aVBut what about the real cybercriminals?
p162
aVWell real organized crime on the Internet
p163
aVgoes back about 10 years
p164
aVwhen a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers
p165
aVdeveloped a website,
p166
aVwhich led to the industrialization
p167
aVof cybercrime.
p168
aVWelcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet.
p169
aVThis is how they were advertising themselves
p170
aVa decade ago on the Net.
p171
aVNow CarderPlanet was very interesting.
p172
aVCybercriminals would go there
p173
aVto buy and sell stolen credit card details,
p174
aVto exchange information
p175
aVabout new malware that was out there.
p176
aVAnd remember, this is a time
p177
aVwhen we're seeing for the first time
p178
aVso-called off-the-shelf malware.
p179
aVThis is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff,
p180
aVwhich you can deploy
p181
aVeven if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket
p184
aVfor cybercriminals.
p185
aVAnd its creators
p186
aVwere incredibly smart and entrepreneurial,
p187
aVbecause they were faced
p188
aVwith one enormous challenge as cybercriminals.
p189
aVAnd that challenge is:
p190
aVHow do you do business,
p191
aVhow do you trust
p192
aVsomebody on the Web who you want to do business with
p193
aVwhen you know that they're a criminal?
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVIt's axiomatic that they're dodgy,
p196
aVand they're going to want to try and rip you off.
p197
aVSo the family, as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known,
p198
aVcame up with this brilliant idea
p199
aVcalled the escrow system.
p200
aVThey appointed an officer
p201
aVwho would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.
p202
aVThe vendor, say, had stolen credit card details;
p203
aVthe purchaser wanted to get a hold of them.
p204
aVThe purchaser would send the administrative officer
p205
aVsome dollars digitally,
p206
aVand the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details.
p207
aVAnd the officer would then verify
p208
aVif the stolen credit card worked.
p209
aVAnd if they did,
p210
aVhe then passed on the money to the vendor
p211
aVand the stolen credit card details to the purchaser.
p212
aVAnd it was this
p213
aVwhich completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web.
p214
aVAnd after that, it just went wild.
p215
aVWe had a champagne decade
p216
aVfor people who we know as Carders.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow I spoke to one of these Carders
p219
aVwho we'll call RedBrigade \u2014
p220
aValthough that wasn't even his proper nickname \u2014
p221
aVbut I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was.
p222
aVAnd he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004
p223
aVhe would go on sprees in New York,
p224
aVtaking out $10,000 from an ATM here,
p225
aV$30,000 from an ATM there,
p226
aVusing cloned credit cards.
p227
aVHe was making, on average a week,
p228
aV$150,000 \u2014
p229
aVtax free of course.
p230
aVAnd he said
p231
aVthat he had so much money
p232
aVstashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point
p233
aVthat he just didn't know what to do with it
p234
aVand actually fell into a depression.
p235
aVBut that's a slightly different story,
p236
aVwhich I won't go into now.
p237
aVNow the interesting thing about RedBrigade
p238
aVis that he wasn't an advanced hacker.
p239
aVHe sort of understood the technology,
p240
aVand he realized that security was very important
p241
aVif you were going to be a Carder,
p242
aVbut he didn't spend his days and nights
p243
aVbent over a computer, eating pizza,
p244
aVdrinking coke and that sort of thing.
p245
aVHe was out there on the town
p246
aVhaving a fab time enjoying the high life.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd this is because
p249
aVhackers are only one element
p250
aVin a cybercriminal enterprise.
p251
aVAnd often they're the most vulnerable element of all.
p252
aVAnd I want to explain this to you
p253
aVby introducing you to six characters
p254
aVwho I met
p255
aVwhile I was doing this research.
p256
aVDimitry Golubov, aka SCRIPT \u2014
p257
aVborn in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982.
p258
aVNow he developed his social and moral compass
p259
aVon the Black Sea port during the 1990s.
p260
aVThis was a sink-or-swim environment
p261
aVwhere involvement in criminal or corrupt activities
p262
aVwas entirely necessary
p263
aVif you wanted to survive.
p264
aVAs an accomplished computer user,
p265
aVwhat Dimitry did
p266
aVwas to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown
p267
aVonto the Worldwide Web.
p268
aVAnd he did a great job in it.
p269
aVYou have to understand though
p270
aVthat from his ninth birthday,
p271
aVthe only environment he knew
p272
aVwas gangsterism.
p273
aVHe knew no other way of making a living
p274
aVand making money.
p275
aa(lp276
VThen we have Renukanth Subramaniam,
p277
aVaka JiLsi \u2014
p278
aVfounder of DarkMarket,
p279
aVborn in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
p280
aVAs an eight year-old,
p281
aVhe and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital
p282
aVbecause Singhalese mobs were roaming the city,
p283
aVlooking for Tamils like Renu to murder.
p284
aVAt 11, he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military,
p285
aVaccused of being a terrorist,
p286
aVand his parents sent him on his own to Britain
p287
aVas a refugee seeking political asylum.
p288
aVAt 13,
p289
aVwith only little English and being bullied at school,
p290
aVhe escaped into a world of computers
p291
aVwhere he showed great technical ability,
p292
aVbut he was soon being seduced
p293
aVby people on the Internet.
p294
aVHe was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud,
p295
aVand he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London
p296
aVin 2012.
p297
aa(lp298
VMatrix001,
p299
aVwho was an administrator at DarkMarket.
p300
aVBorn in Southern Germany
p301
aVto a stable and well-respected middle class family,
p302
aVhis obsession with gaming as a teenager
p303
aVled him to hacking.
p304
aVAnd he was soon controlling huge servers around the world
p305
aVwhere he stored his games
p306
aVthat he had cracked and pirated.
p307
aVHis slide into criminality
p308
aVwas incremental.
p309
aVAnd when he finally woke up to his situation
p310
aVand understood the implications,
p311
aVhe was already in too deep.
p312
aa(lp313
VMax Vision, aka ICEMAN \u2014
p314
aVmastermind of CardersMarket.
p315
aVBorn in Meridian, Idaho.
p316
aVMax Vision was one of the best penetration testers
p317
aVworking out of Santa Clara, California
p318
aVin the late 90s for private companies
p319
aVand voluntarily for the FBI.
p320
aVNow in the late 1990s,
p321
aVhe discovered a vulnerability
p322
aVon all U.S. government networks,
p323
aVand he went in and patched it up \u2014
p324
aVbecause this included nuclear research facilities \u2014
p325
aVsparing the American government
p326
aVa huge security embarrassment.
p327
aVBut also, because he was an inveterate hacker,
p328
aVhe left a tiny digital wormhole
p329
aVthrough which he alone could crawl.
p330
aVBut this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator,
p331
aVand he was convicted.
p332
aVAt his open prison,
p333
aVhe came under the influence of financial fraudsters,
p334
aVand those financial fraudsters
p335
aVpersuaded him to work for them
p336
aVon his release.
p337
aVAnd this man with a planetary-sized brain
p338
aVis now serving a 13-year sentence
p339
aVin California.
p340
aa(lp341
VAdewale Taiwo, aka FreddyBB \u2014
p342
aVmaster bank account cracker
p343
aVfrom Abuja in Nigeria.
p344
aVHe set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup,
p345
aVbankfrauds@yahoo.co.uk
p346
aVbefore arriving in Britain
p347
aVin 2005
p348
aVto take a Masters in chemical engineering
p349
aVat Manchester University.
p350
aVHe impressed in the private sector,
p351
aVdeveloping chemical applications for the oil industry
p352
aVwhile simultaneously running
p353
aVa worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions
p354
aVuntil his arrest in 2008.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd then finally, Cagatay Evyapan,
p357
aVaka Cha0 \u2014
p358
aVone of the most remarkable hackers ever,
p359
aVfrom Ankara in Turkey.
p360
aVHe combined the tremendous skills of a geek
p361
aVwith the suave social engineering skills
p362
aVof the master criminal.
p363
aVOne of the smartest people I've ever met.
p364
aVHe also had the most effective
p365
aVvirtual private network security arrangement
p366
aVthe police have ever encountered
p367
aVamongst global cybercriminals.
p368
aa(lp369
VNow the important thing
p370
aVabout all of these people
p371
aVis they share certain characteristics
p372
aVdespite the fact that they come from very different environments.
p373
aVThey are all people who learned their hacking skills
p374
aVin their early to mid-teens.
p375
aVThey are all people
p376
aVwho demonstrate advanced ability
p377
aVin maths and the sciences.
p378
aVRemember that, when they developed those hacking skills,
p379
aVtheir moral compass had not yet developed.
p380
aVAnd most of them, with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha0,
p381
aVthey did not demonstrate
p382
aVany real social skills in the outside world \u2014
p383
aVonly on the Web.
p384
aa(lp385
VAnd the other thing is
p386
aVthe high incidence of hackers like these
p387
aVwho have characteristics which are consistent
p388
aVwith Asperger's syndrome.
p389
aVNow I discussed this
p390
aVwith Professor Simon Baron-Cohen
p391
aVwho's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge.
p392
aVAnd he has done path-breaking work on autism
p393
aVand confirmed, also for the authorities here,
p394
aVthat Gary McKinnon \u2014
p395
aVwho is wanted by the United States
p396
aVfor hacking into the Pentagon \u2014
p397
aVsuffers from Asperger's
p398
aVand a secondary condition
p399
aVof depression.
p400
aVAnd Baron-Cohen explained
p401
aVthat certain disabilities
p402
aVcan manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world
p403
aVas tremendous skills,
p404
aVand that we should not be throwing in jail
p405
aVpeople who have such disabilities and skills
p406
aVbecause they have lost their way socially
p407
aVor been duped.
p408
aa(lp409
VNow I think we're missing a trick here,
p410
aVbecause I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail.
p411
aVAnd let me be blunt about this.
p412
aVIn China, in Russia and in loads of other countries
p413
aVthat are developing cyber-offensive capabilities,
p414
aVthis is exactly what they are doing.
p415
aVThey are recruiting hackers
p416
aVboth before and after they become involved
p417
aVin criminal and industrial espionage activities \u2014
p418
aVare mobilizing them
p419
aVon behalf of the state.
p420
aVWe need to engage
p421
aVand find ways of offering guidance
p422
aVto these young people,
p423
aVbecause they are a remarkable breed.
p424
aVAnd if we rely, as we do at the moment,
p425
aVsolely on the criminal justice system
p426
aVand the threat of punitive sentences,
p427
aVwe will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame.
p428
aa(lp429
VThank you very much for listening.
p430
aa(lp431
V(Applause)
p432
aa(lp433
VChris Anderson: So your idea worth spreading
p434
aVis hire hackers.
p435
aVHow would someone get over that kind of fear
p436
aVthat the hacker they hire
p437
aVmight preserve that little teensy wormhole?
p438
aa(lp439
VMG: I think to an extent,
p440
aVyou have to understand
p441
aVthat it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that.
p442
aVThey're just relentless and obsessive
p443
aVabout what they do.
p444
aVBut all of the people who I've spoken to
p445
aVwho have fallen foul of the law,
p446
aVthey have all said, "Please, please give us a chance
p447
aVto work in the legitimate industry.
p448
aVWe just never knew how to get there, what we were doing.
p449
aVWe want to work with you."
p450
aa(lp451
VChris Anderson: Okay, well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha.

VThe brain is an amazing and complex organ.
p5
aVAnd while many people are fascinated by the brain,
p6
aVthey can't really tell you that much
p7
aVabout the properties about how the brain works
p8
aVbecause we don't teach neuroscience in schools.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd one of the reasons why is that the equipment
p11
aVis so complex and so expensive
p12
aVthat it's really only done at major universities and large institutions.
p13
aVAnd so in order to be able to access the brain,
p14
aVyou really need to dedicate your life
p15
aVand spend six and a half years as a graduate student
p16
aVjust to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd that's a shame because one out of five of us,
p19
aVthat's 20 percent of the entire world, will have a neurological disorder.
p20
aVAnd there are zero cures for these diseases.
p21
aVAnd so it seems that what we should be doing
p22
aVis reaching back earlier in the eduction process
p23
aVand teaching students about neuroscience so that in the future,
p24
aVthey may be thinking about possibly becoming a brain scientist.
p25
aa(lp26
VWhen I was a graduate student, my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself,
p27
aVdecided that what if we took this complex equipment that we have
p28
aVfor studying the brain and made it simple enough and affordable enough
p29
aVthat anyone that you know, an amateur or a high school student,
p30
aVcould learn and actually participate in the discovery of neuroscience.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd so we did just that.
p33
aVA few years ago, we started a company called Backyard Brains
p34
aVand we make DIY neuroscience equipment and I brought some here tonight,
p35
aVand I want to do some demonstrations.
p36
aVYou guys want to see some?
p37
aa(lp38
VSo I need a volunteer.
p39
aVSo right before \u2014 what is your name? (Applause)
p40
aVSam Kelly: Sam.
p41
aVGreg Gage: All right, Sam, I'm going to record from your brain.
p42
aVHave you had this before?
p43
aVSK: No.
p44
aVGG: I need you to stick out your arm for science,
p45
aVroll up your sleeve a bit,
p46
aVSo what I'm going to do, I'm putting electrodes on your arm,
p47
aVand you're probably wondering,
p48
aVI just said I'm going to record from your brain, what am I doing with your arm?
p49
aa(lp50
VWell, you have about 80 billion neurons inside your brain right now.
p51
aVThey're sending electrical messages back and forth, and chemical messages.
p52
aVBut some of your neurons right here in your motor cortex
p53
aVare going to send messages down when you move your arm like this.
p54
aVThey're going to go down across your corpus callosum,
p55
aVdown onto your spinal cord to your lower motor neuron
p56
aVout to your muscles here,
p57
aVand that electrical discharge is going to be picked up
p58
aVby these electrodes right here
p59
aVand we're going to be able to listen
p60
aVto exactly what your brain is going to be doing.
p61
aVSo I'm going to turn this on for a second.
p62
aa(lp63
VHave you ever heard what your brain sounds like?
p64
aVSK: No.
p65
aVGG: Let's try it out. So go ahead and squeeze your hand.
p66
aV(Rumbling)
p67
aVSo what you're listening to,
p68
aVso this is your motor units happening right here.
p69
aVLet's take a look at it as well.
p70
aVSo I'm going to stand over here,
p71
aVand I'm going to open up our app here.
p72
aVSo now I want you to squeeze.
p73
aV(Rumbling)
p74
aa(lp75
VSo right here, these are the motor units that are happening
p76
aVfrom her spinal cord out to her muscle right here,
p77
aVand as she's doing it,
p78
aVyou're seeing the electrical activity that's happening here.
p79
aVYou can even click here and try to see one of them.
p80
aVSo keep doing it really hard.
p81
aVSo now we've paused
p82
aVon one motor action potential that's happening right now inside of your brain.
p83
aa(lp84
VDo you guys want to see some more?
p85
aV(Applause)
p86
aVThat's interesting, but let's get it better.
p87
aVI need one more volunteer.
p88
aVWhat is your name, sir?
p89
aVMiguel Goncalves: Miguel.
p90
aVGG: Miguel, all right.
p91
aVYou're going to stand right here.
p92
aVSo when you're moving your arm like this,
p93
aVyour brain is sending a signal down to your muscles right here.
p94
aVI want you to move your arm as well.
p95
aVSo your brain is going to send a signal down to your muscles.
p96
aVAnd so it turns out that there is a nerve that's right here
p97
aVthat runs up here that innervates these three fingers,
p98
aVand it's close enough to the skin that we might be able
p99
aVto stimulate that so that what we can do
p100
aVis copy your brain signals going out to your hand
p101
aVand inject it into your hand,
p102
aVso that your hand will move when your brain tells your hand to move.
p103
aVSo in a sense, she will take away your free will
p104
aVand you will no longer have any control over this hand.
p105
aVYou with me?
p106
aa(lp107
VSo I just need to hook you up.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVSo I'm going to find your ulnar nerve,
p110
aVwhich is probably right around here.
p111
aVYou don't know what you're signing up for
p112
aVwhen you come up.
p113
aVSo now I'm going to move away and we're going to plug it in
p114
aVto our human-to-human interface over here.
p115
aa(lp116
VOkay, so Sam, I want you to squeeze your hand again.
p117
aVDo it again. Perfect.
p118
aVSo now I'm going to hook you up over here so that you get the \u2014
p119
aVIt's going to feel a little bit weird at first,
p120
aVthis is going to feel like a \u2014 (Laughter)
p121
aVYou know, when you lose your free will, and someone else becomes your agent,
p122
aVit does feel a bit strange.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow I want you to relax your hand.
p125
aVSam, you're with me?
p126
aVSo you're going to squeeze.
p127
aVI'm not going to turn it on yet, so go ahead and give it a squeeze.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo now, are you ready, Miguel?
p130
aVMG: Ready as I'll ever be.
p131
aVGG: I've turned it on, so go ahead and turn your hand.
p132
aVDo you feel that a little bit? MG: Nope.
p133
aVGG: Okay, do it again? MG: A little bit.
p134
aVGG: A little bit? (Laughter)
p135
aVSo relax.
p136
aVSo hit it again.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aVOh, perfect, perfect.
p139
aVSo relax, do it again.
p140
aa(lp141
VAll right, so right now,
p142
aVyour brain is controlling your arm and it's also controlling his arm,
p143
aVso go ahead and just do it one more time.
p144
aVAll right, so it's perfect. (Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VSo now, what would happen if I took over my control of your hand?
p147
aVAnd so, just relax your hand.
p148
aVWhat happens?
p149
aVAh, nothing.
p150
aVWhy not?
p151
aVBecause the brain has to do it.
p152
aVSo you do it again.
p153
aVAll right, that's perfect.
p154
aa(lp155
VThank you guys for being such a good sport.
p156
aVThis is what's happening all across the world \u2014
p157
aVelectrophysiology!
p158
aVWe're going to bring on the neuro-revolution.
p159
aa(lp160
VThank you.

VI am a plant geneticist.
p5
aVI study genes that make plants resistant to disease
p6
aVand tolerant of stress.
p7
aVIn recent years,
p8
aVmillions of people around the world have come to believe
p9
aVthat there's something sinister about genetic modification.
p10
aVToday, I am going to provide a different perspective.
p11
aa(lp12
VFirst, let me introduce my husband, Raoul.
p13
aVHe's an organic farmer.
p14
aVOn his farm, he plants a variety of different crops.
p15
aVThis is one of the many ecological farming practices
p16
aVhe uses to keep his farm healthy.
p17
aVImagine some of the reactions we get:
p18
aV"Really? An organic farmer and a plant geneticist?
p19
aVCan you agree on anything?"
p20
aa(lp21
VWell, we can, and it's not difficult, because we have the same goal.
p22
aVWe want to help nourish the growing population
p23
aVwithout further destroying the environment.
p24
aVI believe this is the greatest challenge of our time.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, genetic modification is not new;
p27
aVvirtually everything we eat has been genetically modified
p28
aVin some manner.
p29
aVLet me give you a few examples.
p30
aVOn the left is an image
p31
aVof the ancient ancestor of modern corn.
p32
aVYou see a single roll of grain that's covered in a hard case.
p33
aVUnless you have a hammer,
p34
aVteosinte isn't good for making tortillas.
p35
aVNow, take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana.
p36
aVYou can see the large seeds.
p37
aVAnd unappetizing brussel sprouts,
p38
aVand eggplant, so beautiful.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, to create these varieties,
p41
aVbreeders have used many different genetic techniques over the years.
p42
aVSome of them are quite creative,
p43
aVlike mixing two different species together
p44
aVusing a process called grafting
p45
aVto create this variety that's half tomato and half potato.
p46
aVBreeders have also used other types of genetic techniques,
p47
aVsuch as random mutagenesis,
p48
aVwhich induces uncharacterized mutations
p49
aVinto the plants.
p50
aVThe rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies
p51
aVwas developed using this approach.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, today, breeders have even more options to choose from.
p54
aVSome of them are extraordinarily precise.
p55
aa(lp56
VI want to give you a couple examples from my own work.
p57
aVI work on rice, which is a staple food for more than half the world's people.
p58
aVEach year, 40 percent of the potential harvest
p59
aVis lost to pest and disease.
p60
aVFor this reason, farmers plant rice varieties
p61
aVthat carry genes for resistance.
p62
aVThis approach has been used for nearly 100 years.
p63
aVYet, when I started graduate school,
p64
aVno one knew what these genes were.
p65
aVIt wasn't until the 1990s that scientists finally uncovered
p66
aVthe genetic basis of resistance.
p67
aVIn my laboratory, we isolated a gene for immunity to a very serious
p68
aVbacterial disease in Asia and Africa.
p69
aVWe found we could engineer the gene into a conventional rice variety
p70
aVthat's normally susceptible,
p71
aVand you can see the two leaves on the bottom here
p72
aVare highly resistant to infection.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, the same month that my laboratory published
p75
aVour discovery on the rice immunity gene,
p76
aVmy friend and colleague Dave Mackill stopped by my office.
p77
aVHe said, "Seventy million rice farmers are having trouble growing rice."
p78
aVThat's because their fields are flooded,
p79
aVand these rice farmers are living on less than two dollars a day.
p80
aVAlthough rice grows well in standing water,
p81
aVmost rice varieties will die if they're submerged
p82
aVfor more than three days.
p83
aVFlooding is expected to be increasingly problematic
p84
aVas the climate changes.
p85
aVHe told me that his graduate student Kenong Xu and himself
p86
aVwere studying an ancient variety of rice that had an amazing property.
p87
aVIt could withstand two weeks of complete submergence.
p88
aVHe asked if I would be willing to help them isolate this gene.
p89
aVI said yes \u2014 I was very excited, because I knew if we were successful,
p90
aVwe could potentially help millions of farmers grow rice
p91
aVeven when their fields were flooded.
p92
aa(lp93
VKenong spent 10 years looking for this gene.
p94
aVThen one day, he said,
p95
aV"Come look at this experiment. You've got to see it."
p96
aVI went to the greenhouse and I saw
p97
aVthat the conventional variety that was flooded for 18 days had died,
p98
aVbut the rice variety that we had genetically engineered
p99
aVwith a new gene we had discovered, called Sub1, was alive.
p100
aVKenong and I were amazed and excited
p101
aVthat a single gene could have this dramatic effect.
p102
aVBut this is just a greenhouse experiment.
p103
aVWould this work in the field?
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, I'm going to show you a four-month time lapse video
p106
aVtaken at the International Rice Research Institute.
p107
aVBreeders there developed a rice variety carrying the Sub1 gene
p108
aVusing another genetic technique called precision breeding.
p109
aVOn the left, you can see the Sub1 variety,
p110
aVand on the right is the conventional variety.
p111
aVBoth varieties do very well at first,
p112
aVbut then the field is flooded for 17 days.
p113
aVYou can see the Sub1 variety does great.
p114
aVIn fact, it produces three and a half times more grain
p115
aVthan the conventional variety.
p116
aVI love this video
p117
aVbecause it shows the power of plant genetics to help farmers.
p118
aVLast year, with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
p119
aVthree and a half million farmers grew Sub1 rice.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
VThank you.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, many people don't mind genetic modification
p126
aVwhen it comes to moving rice genes around,
p127
aVrice genes in rice plants,
p128
aVor even when it comes to mixing species together
p129
aVthrough grafting or random mutagenesis.
p130
aVBut when it comes to taking genes from viruses and bacteria
p131
aVand putting them into plants,
p132
aVa lot of people say, "Yuck."
p133
aVWhy would you do that?
p134
aVThe reason is that sometimes it's the cheapest, safest,
p135
aVand most effective technology
p136
aVfor enhancing food security and advancing sustainable agriculture.
p137
aVI'm going to give you three examples.
p138
aa(lp139
VFirst, take a look at papaya. It's delicious, right?
p140
aVBut now, look at this papaya.
p141
aVThis papaya is infected with papaya ringspot virus.
p142
aVIn the 1950s, this virus nearly wiped out the entire production
p143
aVof papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.
p144
aVMany people thought that the Hawaiian papaya was doomed,
p145
aVbut then, a local Hawaiian,
p146
aVa plant pathologist named Dennis Gonsalves,
p147
aVdecided to try to fight this disease using genetic engineering.
p148
aVHe took a snippet of viral DNA and he inserted it
p149
aVinto the papaya genome.
p150
aVThis is kind of like a human getting a vaccination.
p151
aVNow, take a look at his field trial.
p152
aVYou can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center.
p153
aVIt's immune to infection.
p154
aVThe conventional papaya around the outside is severely infected with the virus.
p155
aVDennis' pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry.
p156
aVToday, 20 years later, there's still no other method to control this disease.
p157
aVThere's no organic method. There's no conventional method.
p158
aVEighty percent of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow, some of you may still feel a little queasy about viral genes in your food,
p161
aVbut consider this:
p162
aVThe genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the virus.
p163
aVIf you bite into an organic or conventional papaya
p164
aVthat is infected with the virus,
p165
aVyou will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow, take a look at this pest feasting on an eggplant.
p168
aVThe brown you see is frass,
p169
aVwhat comes out the back end of the insect.
p170
aVTo control this serious pest,
p171
aVwhich can devastate the entire eggplant crop in Bangladesh,
p172
aVBangladeshi farmers spray insecticides
p173
aVtwo to three times a week,
p174
aVsometimes twice a day, when pest pressure is high.
p175
aVBut we know that some insecticides are very harmful to human health,
p176
aVespecially when farmers and their families
p177
aVcannot afford proper protection, like these children.
p178
aVIn less developed countries, it's estimated that 300,000 people
p179
aVdie every year because of insecticide misuse and exposure.
p180
aVCornell and Bangladeshi scientists decided to fight this disease
p181
aVusing a genetic technique that builds on an organic farming approach.
p182
aVOrganic farmers like my husband Raoul spray an insecticide called B.T.,
p183
aVwhich is based on a bacteria.
p184
aVThis pesticide is very specific to caterpillar pests,
p185
aVand in fact, it's nontoxic to humans, fish and birds.
p186
aVIt's less toxic than table salt.
p187
aVBut this approach does not work well in Bangladesh.
p188
aVThat's because these insecticide sprays
p189
aVare difficult to find, they're expensive,
p190
aVand they don't prevent the insect from getting inside the plants.
p191
aVIn the genetic approach, scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria
p192
aVand insert it directly into the eggplant genome.
p193
aVWill this work to reduce insecticide sprays in Bangladesh?
p194
aVDefinitely.
p195
aVLast season, farmers reported they were able to reduce their insecticide use
p196
aVby a huge amount, almost down to zero.
p197
aVThey're able to harvest and replant for the next season.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, I've given you a couple examples of how genetic engineering can be used
p200
aVto fight pests and disease
p201
aVand to reduce the amount of insecticides.
p202
aVMy final example is an example
p203
aVwhere genetic engineering can be used to reduce malnutrition.
p204
aVIn less developed countries,
p205
aV500,000 children go blind every year because of lack of Vitamin A.
p206
aVMore than half will die.
p207
aVFor this reason, scientists supported by the Rockefeller Foundation
p208
aVgenetically engineered a golden rice
p209
aVto produce beta-carotene, which is the precursor of Vitamin A.
p210
aVThis is the same pigment that we find in carrots.
p211
aVResearchers estimate that just one cup of golden rice per day
p212
aVwill save the lives of thousands of children.
p213
aVBut golden rice is virulently opposed
p214
aVby activists who are against genetic modification.
p215
aVJust last year,
p216
aVactivists invaded and destroyed a field trial in the Philippines.
p217
aVWhen I heard about the destruction,
p218
aVI wondered if they knew that they were destroying much more
p219
aVthan a scientific research project,
p220
aVthat they were destroying medicines that children desperately needed
p221
aVto save their sight and their lives.
p222
aa(lp223
VSome of my friends and family still worry:
p224
aVHow do you know genes in the food are safe to eat?
p225
aVI explained the genetic engineering,
p226
aVthe process of moving genes between species,
p227
aVhas been used for more than 40 years
p228
aVin wines, in medicine, in plants, in cheeses.
p229
aVIn all that time, there hasn't been a single case of harm
p230
aVto human health or the environment.
p231
aVBut I say, look, I'm not asking you to believe me.
p232
aVScience is not a belief system.
p233
aVMy opinion doesn't matter.
p234
aVLet's look at the evidence.
p235
aVAfter 20 years of careful study and rigorous peer review
p236
aVby thousands of independent scientists,
p237
aVevery major scientific organization in the world has concluded
p238
aVthat the crops currently on the market are safe to eat
p239
aVand that the process of genetic engineering
p240
aVis no more risky than older methods of genetic modification.
p241
aVThese are precisely the same organizations that most of us trust
p242
aVwhen it comes to other important scientific issues
p243
aVsuch as global climate change or the safety of vaccines.
p244
aa(lp245
VRaoul and I believe that, instead of worrying about the genes in our food,
p246
aVwe must focus on how we can help children grow up healthy.
p247
aVWe must ask if farmers in rural communities can thrive,
p248
aVand if everyone can afford the food.
p249
aVWe must try to minimize environmental degradation.
p250
aVWhat scares me most about the loud arguments and misinformation
p251
aVabout plant genetics
p252
aVis that the poorest people who most need the technology
p253
aVmay be denied access because of the vague fears and prejudices
p254
aVof those who have enough to eat.
p255
aa(lp256
VWe have a huge challenge in front of us.
p257
aVLet's celebrate scientific innovation and use it.
p258
aVIt's our responsibility
p259
aVto do everything we can to help alleviate human suffering
p260
aVand safeguard the environment.
p261
aa(lp262
VThank you.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Applause)
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you.
p267
aa(lp268
VChris Anderson: Powerfully argued.
p269
aVThe people who argue against GMOs,
p270
aVas I understand it, the core piece comes from two things.
p271
aVOne, complexity and unintended consequence.
p272
aVNature is this incredibly complex machine.
p273
aVIf we put out these brand new genes that we've created,
p274
aVthat haven't been challenged by years of evolution,
p275
aVand they started mixing up with the rest of what's going on,
p276
aVcouldn't that trigger some kind of cataclysm or problem,
p277
aVespecially when you add in the commercial incentive
p278
aVthat some companies have to put them out there?
p279
aVThe fear is that those incentives
p280
aVmean that the decision is not made on purely scientific grounds,
p281
aVand even if it was, that there would be unintended consequences.
p282
aVHow do we know that there isn't a big risk of some unintended consequence?
p283
aVOften our tinkerings with nature do lead to big, unintended consequences
p284
aVand chain reactions.
p285
aa(lp286
VPamela Ronald: Okay, so on the commercial aspects,
p287
aVone thing that's really important to understand is that,
p288
aVin the developed world, farmers in the United States,
p289
aValmost all farmers, whether they're organic or conventional,
p290
aVthey buy seed produced by seed companies.
p291
aVSo there's definitely a commercial interest to sell a lot of seed,
p292
aVbut hopefully they're selling seed that the farmers want to buy.
p293
aVIt's different in the less developed world.
p294
aVFarmers there cannot afford the seed.
p295
aVThese seeds are not being sold.
p296
aVThese seeds are being distributed freely
p297
aVthrough traditional kinds of certification groups,
p298
aVso it is very important in less developed countries
p299
aVthat the seed be freely available.
p300
aa(lp301
VCA: Wouldn't some activists say that this is actually part of the conspiracy?
p302
aVThis is the heroin strategy.
p303
aVYou seed the stuff, and people have no choice
p304
aVbut to be hooked on these seeds forever?
p305
aa(lp306
VPR: There are a lot of conspiracy theories for sure, but it doesn't work that way.
p307
aVFor example, the seed that's being distributed, the flood-tolerant rice,
p308
aVthis is distributed freely
p309
aVthrough Indian and Bangladeshi seed certification agencies,
p310
aVso there's no commercial interest at all.
p311
aVThe golden rice was developed through support of the Rockefeller Foundation.
p312
aVAgain, it's being freely distributed.
p313
aVThere are no commercial profits
p314
aVin this situation.
p315
aVAnd now to address your other question about, well, mixing genes,
p316
aVaren't there some unintended consequences?
p317
aVAbsolutely \u2014 every time we do something different,
p318
aVthere's an unintended consequence,
p319
aVbut one of the points I was trying to make
p320
aVis that we've been doing kind of crazy things to our plants,
p321
aVmutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagenesis.
p322
aVThis induces thousands of uncharacterized mutations,
p323
aVand this is even a higher risk of unintended consequence
p324
aVthan many of the modern methods.
p325
aVAnd so it's really important not to use the term GMO
p326
aVbecause it's scientifically meaningless.
p327
aVI feel it's very important to talk about a specific crop
p328
aVand a specific product, and think about the needs of the consumer.
p329
aa(lp330
VCA: So part of what's happening here is that there's a mental model
p331
aVin a lot of people that nature is nature, and it's pure and pristine,
p332
aVand to tinker with it is Frankensteinian.
p333
aVIt's making something that's pure dangerous in some way,
p334
aVand I think you're saying that that whole model
p335
aVjust misunderstands how nature is.
p336
aVNature is a much more chaotic interplay of genetic changes
p337
aVthat have been happening all the time anyway.
p338
aa(lp339
VPR: That's absolutely true, and there's no such thing as pure food.
p340
aVI mean, you could not spray eggplant with insecticides
p341
aVor not genetically engineer it, but then you'd be stuck eating frass.
p342
aVSo there's no purity there.
p343
aa(lp344
VCA: Pam Ronald, thank you.  That was powerfully argued.
p345
aVPR: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

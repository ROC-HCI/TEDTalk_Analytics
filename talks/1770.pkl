VLiving in Africa is to be on the edge,
p5
aVmetaphorically, and quite literally
p6
aVwhen you think about connectivity before 2008.
p7
aVThough many human intellectual and technological leaps
p8
aVhad happened in Europe and the rest of the world,
p9
aVbut Africa was sort of cut off.
p10
aVAnd that changed, first with ships
p11
aVwhen we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution
p12
aVand also the Industrial Revolution.
p13
aVAnd now we've got the digital revolution.
p14
aVThese revolutions have not been evenly distributed
p15
aVacross continents and nations.
p16
aVNever have been.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables
p19
aVthat connect Africa to the rest of the world.
p20
aVWhat I find amazing is that Africa
p21
aVis transcending its geography problem.
p22
aVAfrica is connecting to the rest of the world
p23
aVand within itself.
p24
aVThe connectivity situation has improved greatly,
p25
aVbut some barriers remain.
p26
aVIt is with this context that Ushahidi came to be.
p27
aa(lp28
VIn 2008, one of the problems that we faced
p29
aVwas lack of information flow.
p30
aVThere was a media blackout in 2008,
p31
aVwhen there was post-election violence in Kenya.
p32
aVIt was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.
p33
aVSo we came together and we created software
p34
aVcalled Ushahidi.
p35
aVAnd Ushahidi means "testimony" or "witness" in Swahili.
p36
aVI'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators.
p37
aVThis is David and Erik.
p38
aVI call them brothers from another mother.
p39
aVClearly I have a German mother somewhere.
p40
aVAnd we worked together first with building
p41
aVand growing Ushahidi.
p42
aVAnd the idea of the software was to gather information
p43
aVfrom SMS, email and web, and put a map
p44
aVso that you could see what was happening where,
p45
aVand you could visualize that data.
p46
aVAnd after that initial prototype,
p47
aVwe set out to make free and open-source software
p48
aVso that others do not have to start from scratch like we did.
p49
aa(lp50
VAll the while, we also wanted to give back
p51
aVto the local tech community that helped us
p52
aVgrow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.
p53
aVAnd that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi,
p54
aVan actual physical space
p55
aVwhere we could collaborate,
p56
aVand it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.
p57
aVWe did that with the support of different organizations
p58
aVlike the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd we were able to grow this software footprint,
p61
aVand a few years later it became
p62
aVvery useful software,
p63
aVand we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti
p64
aVwhere citizens could indicate where they are
p65
aVand what their needs were,
p66
aVand also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis
p67
aVand the tsunami in Japan.
p68
aVNow, this year the Internet turns 20,
p69
aVand Ushahidi turned five.
p70
aa(lp71
VUshahidi is not only the software that we made.
p72
aVIt is the team, and it's also the community
p73
aVthat uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee.
p74
aVWe did not imagine that there would be this many maps
p75
aVaround the world.
p76
aVThere are crisis maps, election maps, corruption maps,
p77
aVand even environmental monitoring crowd maps.
p78
aVWe are humbled that this has roots in Kenya
p79
aVand that it has some use to people around the world
p80
aVtrying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with.
p81
aVThere is more that we're doing to explore this idea
p82
aVof collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen,
p83
aVif I share the information with whatever device that I have,
p84
aVcould inform you about what is going on,
p85
aVand that if you do the same, we can have a bigger picture
p86
aVof what's going on.
p87
aa(lp88
VI moved back to Kenya in 2011.
p89
aVErik moved in 2010.
p90
aVVery different reality. I used to live in Chicago
p91
aVwhere there was abundant Internet access.
p92
aVI had never had to deal with a blackout.
p93
aVAnd in Kenya, it's a very different reality,
p94
aVand one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress
p95
aVand the digital revolution is the electricity problem.
p96
aVThe day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this
p97
aVcan be, let's just say very annoying.
p98
aVBlackouts are not fun.
p99
aVImagine sitting down to start working, and all of a sudden
p100
aVthe power goes out,
p101
aVyour Internet connection goes down with it,
p102
aVso you have to figure out, okay, now, where's the modem,
p103
aVhow do I switch back?
p104
aVAnd then, guess what? You have to deal with it again.
p105
aVNow, this is the reality of Kenya, where we live now,
p106
aVand other parts of Africa.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe other problem that we're facing
p109
aVis that communication costs are also still a challenge.
p110
aVIt costs me five Kenyan shillings,
p111
aVor .06 USD to call the U.S., Canada or China.
p112
aVGuess how much it costs to call Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria?
p113
aVThirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost
p114
aVto connect within Africa.
p115
aVAnd also, when traveling within Africa,
p116
aVyou've got different settings for different mobile providers.
p117
aVThis is the reality that we deal with.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo we've got a joke in Ushahidi
p120
aVwhere we say, "If it works in Africa, it'll work anywhere."
p121
aV[Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.]
p122
aVWhat if we could overcome the problem
p123
aVof unreliable Internet and electricity
p124
aVand reduce the cost of connection?
p125
aVCould we leverage the cloud?
p126
aVWe've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi.
p127
aVCould we leverage these technologies
p128
aVto switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country?
p129
aa(lp130
VSo we looked at the modem,
p131
aVan important part of the infrastructure of the Internet,
p132
aVand asked ourselves why
p133
aVthe modems that we are using right now
p134
aVare built for a different context, where you've got
p135
aVubiquitous internet, you've got ubiquitous electricity,
p136
aVyet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury.
p137
aVWe wanted to redesign the modem
p138
aVfor the developing world, for our context,
p139
aVand for our reality.
p140
aVWhat if we could have connectivity with less friction?
p141
aa(lp142
VThis is the BRCK.
p143
aVIt acts as a backup to the Internet
p144
aVso that, when the power goes out,
p145
aVit fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network.
p146
aVMobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive.
p147
aVIt's actually everywhere.
p148
aVMost towns at least have a 3G connection.
p149
aVSo why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.
p150
aVThe other reason that we built this
p151
aVis when electricity goes down, this has eight hours
p152
aVof battery left, so you can continue working,
p153
aVyou can continue being productive,
p154
aVand let's just say you are less stressed.
p155
aVAnd for rural areas, it can be
p156
aVthe primary means of connection.
p157
aa(lp158
VThe software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play
p159
aVwhen we wondered how can we use the cloud
p160
aVto be more intelligent so that
p161
aVyou can analyze the different networks,
p162
aVand whenever you switch on the backup,
p163
aVyou pick on the fastest network,
p164
aVso we'll have multi-SIM capability
p165
aVso that you can put multiple SIMs,
p166
aVand if one network is faster, that's the one you hop on,
p167
aVand if the up time on that is not very good,
p168
aVthen you hop onto the next one.
p169
aVThe idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere.
p170
aVWith load balancing, this can be possible.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe other interesting thing for us \u2014 we like sensors \u2014
p173
aVis this idea that you could have an on-ramp
p174
aVfor the Internet of things.
p175
aVImagine a weather station that can be attached to this.
p176
aVIt's built in a modular way so that you can also attach
p177
aVa satellite module so that you could have
p178
aVInternet connectivity even in very remote areas.
p179
aa(lp180
VOut of adversity can come innovation,
p181
aVand how can we help the ambitious coders and makers
p182
aVin Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure?
p183
aVAnd for us, we begin with solving the problem
p184
aVin our own backyard in Kenya.
p185
aa(lp186
VIt is not without challenge.
p187
aVOur team has basically been mules carrying components
p188
aVfrom the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations
p189
aVwith customs border agents.
p190
aV"What are you carrying?"
p191
aVAnd the local financing is not
p192
aVpart of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects.
p193
aVSo we put it on Kickstarter, and I'm happy to say that,
p194
aVthrough the support of many people,
p195
aVnot only here but online,
p196
aVthe BRCK has been Kickstarted,
p197
aVand now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins.
p198
aa(lp199
VI will close by saying that, if we solve this
p200
aVfor the local market, it could be impactful
p201
aVnot only for the coders in Nairobi
p202
aVbut also for small business owners
p203
aVwho need reliable connectivity,
p204
aVand it can reduce the cost of connecting,
p205
aVand hopefully collaboration within African countries.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy
p208
aVare connectivity and entrepreneurship.
p209
aVThe BRCK is our part
p210
aVto keep Africans connected,
p211
aVand to help them drive the global digital revolution.
p212
aa(lp213
VThank you.

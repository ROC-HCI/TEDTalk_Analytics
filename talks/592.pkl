VI normally teach courses on
p5
aVhow to rebuild states after war.
p6
aVBut today I've got a personal story to share with you.
p7
aVThis is a picture of my family,
p8
aVmy four siblings \u2014 my mom and I \u2014 taken in 1977.
p9
aVAnd we're actually Cambodians.
p10
aVAnd this picture is taken in Vietnam.
p11
aVSo how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977?
p12
aVWell to explain that, I've got a short video clip
p13
aVto explain the Khmer Rouge regime
p14
aVduring 1975 and 1979.
p15
aa(lp16
VVideo: April 17th, 1975.
p17
aVThe communist Khmer Rouge
p18
aVenters Phnom Penh to liberate their people
p19
aVfrom the encroaching conflict in Vietnam,
p20
aVand American bombing campaigns.
p21
aVLed by peasant-born Pol Pot,
p22
aVthe Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside
p23
aVin order to create a rural communist utopia,
p24
aVmuch like Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in China.
p25
aVThe Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world.
p26
aVBut after four years the grim truth seeps out.
p27
aVIn a country of only seven million people,
p28
aVone and a half million were murdered by their own leaders,
p29
aVtheir bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields.
p30
aa(lp31
VSophal Ear: So, notwithstanding the 1970s narration,
p32
aVon April 17th 1975
p33
aVwe lived in Phnom Penh.
p34
aVAnd my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge
p35
aVto evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days.
p36
aVAnd here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge.
p37
aVThey were young soldiers, typically child soldiers.
p38
aVAnd this is very normal now, of modern day conflict,
p39
aVbecause they're easy to bring into wars.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off.
p42
aVI mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were
p43
aVmore munitions that fell on Cambodia
p44
aVthan in all of World War II Japan,
p45
aVincluding the two nuclear bombs
p46
aVof August 1945.
p47
aVThe Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money.
p48
aVSo the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank
p49
aVin Cambodia was bombed.
p50
aVBut not just that, they actually banned money.
p51
aVI think it's the only precedent in which
p52
aVmoney has ever been stopped from being used.
p53
aVAnd we know money is the root of all evil,
p54
aVbut it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact.
p55
aa(lp56
VMy family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province.
p57
aVThis is a picture of what Pursat looks like.
p58
aVIt's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia,
p59
aVwhere rice growing takes place.
p60
aVAnd in fact they were forced to work the fields.
p61
aVSo my father and mother ended up in
p62
aVa sort of concentration camp, labor camp.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd it was at that time that my mother got word
p65
aVfrom the commune chief
p66
aVthat the Vietnamese were actually asking
p67
aVfor their citizens to go back to Vietnam.
p68
aVAnd she spoke some Vietnamese,
p69
aVas a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends.
p70
aVAnd she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors,
p71
aVthat she would take the chance
p72
aVand claim to be Vietnamese
p73
aVso that we could have a chance to survive,
p74
aVbecause at this point they're forcing everybody to work.
p75
aVAnd they're giving about \u2014
p76
aVin a modern-day, caloric-restriction diet, I guess \u2014
p77
aVthey're giving porridge, with a few grains of rice.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd at about this time actually
p80
aVmy father got very sick.
p81
aVAnd he didn't speak Vietnamese.
p82
aVSo he died actually, in January 1976.
p83
aVAnd it made it possible, in fact,
p84
aVfor us to take on this plan.
p85
aVSo the Khmer Rouge took us
p86
aVfrom a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev,
p87
aVwhich is across from the border from Vietnam.
p88
aVAnd there they had a detention camp
p89
aVwhere alleged Vietnamese would be tested, language tested.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd my mother's Vietnamese was so bad
p92
aVthat to make our story more credible,
p93
aVshe'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names.
p94
aVBut she'd given the boys girls' names,
p95
aVand the girls boys' names.
p96
aVAnd it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady
p97
aVwho told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively,
p98
aVthat she was able to go into her exam
p99
aVand \u2014 you know, this was a moment of truth.
p100
aVIf she fails, we're all headed to the gallows;
p101
aVif she passes, we can leave to Vietnam.
p102
aVAnd she actually, of course \u2014 I'm here, she passes.
p103
aVAnd we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side.
p104
aVAnd then onwards to Chau Doc.
p105
aVAnd this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.
p106
aVA pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta.
p107
aVBut for us it meant freedom.
p108
aVAnd freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge.
p109
aa(lp110
VLast year, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal,
p111
aVwhich the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on,
p112
aVstarted, and I decided that as a matter of record
p113
aVI should file a Civil Complaint
p114
aVwith the Tribunal about my father's passing away.
p115
aVAnd I got word last month
p116
aVthat the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.
p117
aVAnd it's for me a matter of justice for history, and accountability for the future,
p118
aVbecause Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place, at times.
p119
aa(lp120
VFive years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc.
p121
aVAnd she was able to return to a place
p122
aVthat for her meant freedom, but also fear,
p123
aVbecause we had just come out of Cambodia.
p124
aVI'm happy, actually, today, to present her.
p125
aVShe's here today with us in the audience.
p126
aVThank you mother.

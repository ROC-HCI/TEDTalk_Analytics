VHow will we be remembered in 200 years?
p5
aVI happen to live in a little town, Princeton, in New Jersey,
p6
aVwhich every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history:
p7
aVthe Battle of Princeton, which was, in fact, a very important battle.
p8
aVIt was the first battle that George Washington won, in fact,
p9
aVand was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence.
p10
aVIt happened 225 years ago.
p11
aVIt was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton.
p12
aVThe town was burned down; it was in the middle of winter,
p13
aVand it was a very, very severe winter.
p14
aVAnd about a quarter of all the people in Princeton died that winter
p15
aVfrom hunger and cold, but nobody remembers that.
p16
aVWhat they remember is, of course, the great triumph,
p17
aVthat the Brits were beaten, and we won, and that the country was born.
p18
aVAnd so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered.
p19
aVIt's the child that's remembered.
p20
aVAnd that's what we're going through at this time.
p21
aa(lp22
VI wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology,
p23
aVbecause I think I know very little about that \u2014 I'm not a biologist \u2014
p24
aVso everything I know about it can be said in one minute.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVWhat I'm saying is that we should follow the model
p27
aVthat has been so successful with the electronic industry,
p28
aVthat what really turned computers into a great success, in the world
p29
aVas a whole, is toys. As soon as computers became toys,
p30
aVwhen kids could come home and play with them,
p31
aVthen the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech.
p32
aa(lp33
VThere's a huge \u2014
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aV(Applause)
p36
aV\u2014 there's a huge community of people in the world
p37
aVwho are practical biologists, who are dog breeders,
p38
aVpigeon breeders, orchid breeders, rose breeders,
p39
aVpeople who handle biology with their hands,
p40
aVand who are dedicated to producing beautiful things, beautiful creatures,
p41
aVplants, animals, pets. These people will be empowered with biotech,
p42
aVand that will be an enormous positive step
p43
aVto acceptance of biotechnology.
p44
aVThat will blow away a lot of the opposition.
p45
aVWhen people have this technology in their hands,
p46
aVyou have a do-it-yourself biotech kit, grow your own \u2014
p47
aVgrow your dog, grow your own cat.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aV(Applause)
p50
aVJust buy the software, you design it. I won't say anymore,
p51
aVyou can take it on from there. It's going to happen, and
p52
aVI think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural,
p53
aVbecomes part of the human condition,
p54
aVsomething that everybody's familiar with and everybody accepts.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo, let's leave that aside.
p57
aVI want to talk about something quite different,
p58
aVwhich is what I know about, and that is astronomy.
p59
aVAnd I'm interested in searching for life in the universe.
p60
aVAnd it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that,
p61
aVand that's what I'll talk about for 10 minutes,
p62
aVor whatever the time remains.
p63
aVThe important fact is, that most of the real estate
p64
aVthat's accessible to us \u2014 I'm not talking about the stars,
p65
aVI'm talking about the solar system, the stuff that's within reach
p66
aVfor spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes \u2014
p67
aVmost of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun.
p68
aa(lp69
VIf you look at the solar system, as we know it today,
p70
aVit has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live.
p71
aVIt has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between
p72
aVthe orbit of the Earth out through \u2014 to the orbit of Jupiter.
p73
aVThe asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate,
p74
aVbut not very large. And it's not very promising for life,
p75
aVsince most of it consists of rock and metal, mostly rock.
p76
aVIt's not only cold, but very dry.
p77
aVSo the asteroids we don't have much hope for.
p78
aa(lp79
VThere stand some interesting places a little further out:
p80
aVthe moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
p81
aVParticularly, there's a place called Europa, which is \u2014
p82
aVEuropa is one of the moons of Jupiter,
p83
aVwhere we see a very level ice surface,
p84
aVwhich looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean.
p85
aVSo, we believe that on Europa there is, in fact, a deep ocean.
p86
aVAnd that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore.
p87
aVOcean \u2014 probably the most likely place for life to originate,
p88
aVjust as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa,
p89
aVto go down through the ice,
p90
aVfind out who is swimming around in the ocean,
p91
aVwhether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters \u2014
p92
aVwhatever there may be that's exciting \u2014- or cephalopods.
p93
aVBut that's hard to do. Unfortunately, the ice is thick.
p94
aVWe don't know just how thick it is, probably miles thick,
p95
aVso it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there \u2014
p96
aVsend down your submarine or whatever it is \u2014 and explore.
p97
aVThat's something we don't yet know how to do.
p98
aVThere are plans to do it, but it's hard.
p99
aa(lp100
VGo out a bit further, you'll find that beyond the orbit of Neptune,
p101
aVway out, far from the Sun, that's where the real estate really begins.
p102
aVYou'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which,
p103
aVin what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud \u2014
p104
aVthese are clouds of small objects which appear as comets
p105
aVwhen they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there
p106
aVin the cold of the outer solar system,
p107
aVbut they are biologically very interesting indeed,
p108
aVbecause they consist primarily of ice with other minerals,
p109
aVwhich are just the right ones for developing life.
p110
aVSo if life could be established out there,
p111
aVit would have all the essentials \u2014 chemistry and sunlight \u2014
p112
aVeverything that's needed.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo, what I'm proposing
p115
aVis that there is where we should be looking for life, rather than on Mars,
p116
aValthough Mars is, of course, also a very promising and interesting place.
p117
aVBut we can look outside, very cheaply and in a simple fashion.
p118
aVAnd that's what I'm going to talk about.
p119
aVThere is a \u2014 imagine that life originated on Europa,
p120
aVand it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.
p121
aVIt's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface,
p122
aVjust as it did on the Earth.
p123
aVStaying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years,
p124
aVfinally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great \u2014
p125
aVmuch greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures
p126
aVdeveloped on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.
p127
aVAnd the step from the ocean to the land was not easy, but it happened.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, if life had originated on Europa in the ocean,
p130
aVit could also have moved out onto the surface.
p131
aVThere wouldn't have been any air there \u2014 it's a vacuum.
p132
aVIt is out in the cold, but it still could have come.
p133
aVYou can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp
p134
aVthrough cracks in the ice, growing on the surface.
p135
aVWhat would they need in order to grow on the surface?
p136
aVThey'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves
p137
aVfrom losing water through the skin.
p138
aVSo they would have to have something like a reptilian skin.
p139
aVBut better \u2014 what is more important
p140
aVis that they would have to concentrate sunlight.
p141
aVThe sunlight in Jupiter, on the satellites of Jupiter,
p142
aVis 25 times fainter than it is here,
p143
aVsince Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun.
p144
aVSo they would have to have \u2014 these creatures, which I call sunflowers,
p145
aVwhich I imagine living on the surface of Europa, would have to have
p146
aVeither lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight,
p147
aVso they could keep themselves warm on the surface.
p148
aVOtherwise, they would be at a temperature of minus 150,
p149
aVwhich is certainly not favorable for developing life,
p150
aVat least of the kind we know.
p151
aVBut if they just simply could grow, like leaves,
p152
aVlittle lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight,
p153
aVthen they could keep warm on the surface.
p154
aVThey could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight
p155
aVand have roots going down into the ocean;
p156
aVlife then could flourish much more.
p157
aVSo, why not look? Of course, it's not very likely
p158
aVthat there's life on the surface of Europa.
p159
aVNone of these things is likely, but my,
p160
aVmy philosophy is, look for what's detectable, not for what's probable.
p161
aa(lp162
VThere's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things
p163
aVturning out to be there. And I mean,
p164
aVthe finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole.
p165
aVThis was \u2014 originally, when radio astronomy began,
p166
aVMr. Jansky, at the Bell labs, detected radio waves coming from the sky.
p167
aVAnd the regular astronomers were scornful about this.
p168
aVThey said, "It's all right, you can detect radio waves from the Sun,
p169
aVbut the Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough
p170
aVand bright enough actually to be detectable. You can easily calculate
p171
aVthat radio waves from the Sun are fairly faint,
p172
aVand everything else in the universe is millions of times further away,
p173
aVso it certainly will not be detectable.
p174
aVSo there's no point in looking."
p175
aVAnd that, of course, that set back the progress of radio astronomy
p176
aVby about 20 years.
p177
aVSince there was nothing there, you might as well not look.
p178
aVWell, of course, as soon as anybody did look,
p179
aVwhich was after about 20 years,
p180
aVwhen radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out
p181
aVthe universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things
p182
aVradiating in the radio spectrum, much brighter than the Sun.
p183
aVSo, the same thing could be true for this kind of life,
p184
aVwhich I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact
p185
aVbe very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected
p186
aVjust because we haven't taken the trouble to look.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, the last thing I want to talk about is how to detect it.
p189
aVThere is something called pit lamping.
p190
aVThat's the phrase which I learned from my son George,
p191
aVwho is there in the audience.
p192
aVYou take \u2014 that's a Canadian expression.
p193
aVIf you happen to want to hunt animals at night,
p194
aVyou take a miner's lamp, which is a pit lamp.
p195
aVYou strap it onto your forehead, so you can see
p196
aVthe reflection in the eyes of the animal. So, if you go out at night,
p197
aVyou shine a flashlight, the animals are bright.
p198
aVYou see the red glow in their eyes,
p199
aVwhich is the reflection of the flashlight.
p200
aVAnd then, if you're one of these unsporting characters,
p201
aVyou shoot the animals and take them home.
p202
aVAnd of course, that spoils the game
p203
aVfor the other hunters who hunt in the daytime,
p204
aVso in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand, it's legal,
p205
aVbecause the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits,
p206
aVbecause the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand.
p207
aVSo, the farmers go out at night
p208
aVwith heavily armed jeeps, and shine the headlights,
p209
aVand anything that doesn't look like a sheep, you shoot.
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VSo I have proposed to apply the same trick
p213
aVto looking for life in the universe.
p214
aVThat if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces \u2014
p215
aVeither on Europa, or further out, anywhere where you can live
p216
aVon a cold surface \u2014 those creatures must be provided with reflectors.
p217
aVIn order to concentrate sunlight, they have to have lenses and mirrors \u2014
p218
aVin order to keep themselves warm.
p219
aVAnd then, when you shine sunlight at them,
p220
aVthe sunlight will be reflected back,
p221
aVjust as it is in the eyes of an animal.
p222
aVSo these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings.
p223
aVAnd the further out you go in this, away from the Sun,
p224
aVthe more powerful this reflection will be. So actually,
p225
aVthis method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger
p226
aVas you go further away,
p227
aVbecause the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light
p228
aVshines out even more in contrast against the dark background.
p229
aVSo as you go further away from the Sun,
p230
aVthis becomes more and more powerful.
p231
aVSo, in fact, you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth.
p232
aVWhy aren't we doing it? Simply because nobody thought of it yet.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut I hope that we shall look, and with any \u2014
p235
aVwe probably won't find anything,
p236
aVnone of these speculations may have any basis in fact.
p237
aVBut still, it's a good chance. And of course, if it happens,
p238
aVit will transform our view of life altogether.
p239
aVBecause it means that \u2014 the way life can live out there,
p240
aVit has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet.
p241
aVIt's extremely hard to move from one planet to another.
p242
aVWe're having great difficulties at the moment
p243
aVand any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck.
p244
aVEspecially if you breathe air,
p245
aVit's very hard to get from planet A to planet B,
p246
aVbecause there's no air in between. But if you breathe air \u2014
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aV\u2014 you're dead \u2014
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aV\u2014 as soon as you're off the planet, unless you have a spaceship.
p251
aa(lp252
VBut if you live in a vacuum, if you live on the surface
p253
aVof one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt,
p254
aVthis \u2014 an object like Pluto, or one of the
p255
aVsmaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto,
p256
aVand you happened \u2014 if you're living on the surface there,
p257
aVand you get knocked off the surface by a collision,
p258
aVthen it doesn't change anything all that much.
p259
aVYou still are on a piece of ice, you can still have sunlight
p260
aVand you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another.
p261
aVAnd then if you run into another object, you can stay there
p262
aVand colonize the other object. So life will spread, then,
p263
aVfrom one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt,
p264
aVit's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then
p265
aVa great competition amongst species \u2014 Darwinian evolution \u2014
p266
aVso there'll be a huge advantage to the species
p267
aVwhich is able to jump from one place to another
p268
aVwithout having to wait for a collision. And there'll be advantages
p269
aVfor spreading out long, sort of kelp-like forest of vegetation.
p270
aVI call these creatures sunflowers.
p271
aVThey look like, maybe like sunflowers.
p272
aVThey have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun,
p273
aVand they will be able to spread out in space,
p274
aVbecause gravity on these objects is weak.
p275
aVSo they can collect sunlight from a big area.
p276
aVSo they will, in fact, be quite easy for us to detect.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo, I hope in the next 10 years, we'll find these creatures,
p279
aVand then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change.
p280
aVIf we don't find them, then we can create them ourselves.
p281
aV(Laughter)
p282
aVThat's another wonderful opportunity that's opening.
p283
aVWe can \u2014 as soon as we have a little bit more understanding
p284
aVof genetic engineering, one of the things you can do with your
p285
aVtake-it-home, do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit \u2014
p286
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p287
aVis to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite,
p288
aVa place like Europa, so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures.
p289
aVThat would be a fun thing to do.
p290
aV(Laughter)
p291
aVIn the long run, of course,
p292
aVit would also make it possible for us to move out there.
p293
aVWhat's going to happen in the end,
p294
aVit's not going to be just humans colonizing space,
p295
aVit's going to be life moving out from the Earth,
p296
aVmoving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life,
p297
aVof course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there,
p298
aVit makes it much more exciting, in the short run.
p299
aVBut in the long run, if there's no life there, we create it ourselves.
p300
aVWe transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful
p301
aVthan it is today.
p302
aVSo again, we have a big and wonderful future to look forward.
p303
aVThank you.

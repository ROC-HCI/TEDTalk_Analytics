VThe problem I want to talk with you about is really the problem of:
p5
aVHow does one supply health care in a world in which cost is everything?
p6
aVHow do you do that?
p7
aVAnd the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you,
p8
aVI want to suggest to you,
p9
aVis one in which you say that in order to treat disease,
p10
aVyou have to first know what you're treating, that's diagnostics,
p11
aVand then you have to do something.
p12
aa(lp13
VThe program we're involved in is something we call "Diagnostics for All,"
p14
aVor "zero-cost diagnostics."
p15
aVHow do you provide medically relevant information
p16
aVat as close as possible to zero cost?
p17
aVHow do you do it?
p18
aVLet me just give you two examples.
p19
aVThe rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world:
p20
aVpoor resources, a rigorous environment \u2014 a series of problems \u2014
p21
aVlight weight and things of this kind.
p22
aVAnd also they're not so different from the home health care
p23
aVand diagnostic system world.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, the technology I want to talk about is for the third world,
p26
aVfor the developing world,
p27
aVbut it has, I think, much broader application,
p28
aVbecause information is so important in the health care system.
p29
aVSo you see two examples here.
p30
aVOne is a lab that is actually a fairly high-end laboratory in Africa.
p31
aVThe second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who-knows-what
p32
aVat a table in a market.
p33
aVI don't know what kind of health care is delivered there.
p34
aVBut it's not really what is probably most efficient.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhat is our approach?
p37
aVThe way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost,
p38
aVstarting from the perspective of the United States,
p39
aVis to take our solution,
p40
aVand then try to cut cost out of it.
p41
aVNo matter how you do that,
p42
aVyou're not going to start with a $100,000 instrument
p43
aVand bring it down to no cost.
p44
aVIt isn't going to work.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo the approach we took was the other way around, to ask:
p47
aVWhat is the cheapest possible stuff
p48
aVthat you could make a diagnostic system out of,
p49
aVand get useful information and add function?
p50
aVAnd what we've chosen is paper.
p51
aVWhat you see here is a prototypic device.
p52
aVIt's about a centimeter on the side.
p53
aVIt's about the size of a fingernail.
p54
aVThe lines around the edges are a polymer.
p55
aVIt's made of paper.
p56
aVAnd paper, of course, wicks fluid, as you know, paper, cloth \u2014
p57
aVdrop wine on the tablecloth,
p58
aVand the wine wicks all over everything.
p59
aVPut it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.
p60
aVThat's what a hydrophilic surface does.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo in this device, the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it
p63
aVin a drop of, in this case, urine.
p64
aVThe fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top.
p65
aVThe brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine,
p66
aVthe blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine.
p67
aVAnd the combination of those two is a first-order shot
p68
aVat a number of useful things that you want.
p69
aVSo, this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, how simple can you make the production?
p72
aVWhy do we choose paper?
p73
aVThere's an example of the same thing on a finger,
p74
aVshowing you basically what it looks like.
p75
aVOne reason for using paper is that it's everywhere.
p76
aVWe have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper
p77
aVand wraps, and all kinds of stuff.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo the production capability is there.
p80
aVThe second is, you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place.
p81
aVI'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there
p82
aVwould probably hold something like 100,000 tests,
p83
aVsomething of that kind.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd then finally, a point you don't think of so much
p86
aVin developed world medicine:
p87
aVit eliminates sharps.
p88
aVAnd what sharps means is needles, things that stick.
p89
aVIf you've taken a sample of someone's blood
p90
aVand the someone might have hepatitis C,
p91
aVyou don't want to make a mistake and stick it in you.
p92
aVYou don't want to do that.
p93
aVSo how do you dispose of that?
p94
aVIt's a problem everywhere, and here, you simply burn it.
p95
aVSo it's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow, you say, "If paper is a good idea,
p98
aVother people have surely thought of it."
p99
aVAnd the answer is, of course, yes.
p100
aVThose half of you, roughly, who are women,
p101
aVat some point may have had a pregnancy test.
p102
aVAnd the most common of these is in a device
p103
aVthat looks like the thing on the left.
p104
aVIt's something called a lateral-flow immunoassay.
p105
aVIn that particular test,
p106
aVurine, either containing a hormone called hCG,
p107
aVdoes or does not flow across a piece of paper.
p108
aVAnd there are two bars; one bar indicates that the test is working,
p109
aVand if the second bar shows up, you're pregnant.
p110
aa(lp111
VThis is a terrific kind of test in a binary world,
p112
aVand the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant
p113
aVor you're not pregnant;
p114
aVyou're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant
p115
aVor something of that sort.
p116
aVSo it works very well there, but it doesn't work very well
p117
aVwhen you need more quantitative information.
p118
aa(lp119
VThere are also dipsticks,
p120
aVbut if you look at the dipsticks,
p121
aVthey're for another kind of urine analysis.
p122
aVThere are an awful lot of colors and things like that.
p123
aVWhat do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance?
p124
aVSo the approach we started with is to ask:
p125
aVIs it really practical to make things of this sort?
p126
aVAnd that problem is now, in a purely engineering way, solved.
p127
aVAnd the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper.
p128
aVYou run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer.
p129
aVThe wax printer does what looks like printing.
p130
aVIt is printing.
p131
aVYou put that on, you warm it a little bit,
p132
aVthe wax prints through, so it absorbs into the paper,
p133
aVand you end up with the device you want.
p134
aa(lp135
VThe printers cost 800 bucks now.
p136
aVWe estimate that if you were to run them 24 hours a day,
p137
aVthey'd make about 10 million tests a year.
p138
aVSo it's a solved problem. That particular problem is solved.
p139
aVAnd there is an example of the kind of thing that you see.
p140
aVThat's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.
p141
aVThat takes about two seconds to make.
p142
aVAnd so I regard that as done.
p143
aVThere's a very important issue here,
p144
aVwhich is that because it's a printer, a color printer, it prints colors.
p145
aVThat's what color printers do.
p146
aVI'll show you in a moment, that's actually quite useful.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, the next question that you would like to ask is:
p149
aVWhat would you like to measure? What would you like to analyze?
p150
aVAnd the thing you'd most like to analyze, we're a fair distance from.
p151
aVIt's what's called "fever of undiagnosed origin."
p152
aVSomeone comes into the clinic, they have a fever, they feel bad.
p153
aVWhat do they have?
p154
aVDo they have TB? Do they have AIDS? Do they have a common cold?
p155
aVThe triage problem.
p156
aVThat's a hard problem for reasons I won't go through.
p157
aVThere are an awful lot of things that you'd like to distinguish among.
p158
aVBut then there are a series of things \u2014
p159
aVAIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others \u2014
p160
aVand simpler ones, such as guidance of treatment.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow, even that's more complicated than you think.
p163
aVA friend of mine works in transcultural psychiatry,
p164
aVand he is interested in the question
p165
aVof why people do and don't take their meds.
p166
aVSo Dapsone, or something like that, you have to take for a while.
p167
aVHe has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in India
p168
aVand saying,
p169
aV"Have you taken your Dapsone?" "Yes."
p170
aV"Have you taken it every day?" "Yes."
p171
aV"Have you taken if for a month?" "Yes."
p172
aVWhat the guy actually meant
p173
aVwas that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone to his dog that morning.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd he was telling the truth, because in a different culture,
p178
aVthe dog is a surrogate for you;
p179
aV"today," "this month," "since the rainy season" \u2014
p180
aVthere are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd so an issue here is to, in some cases, figure out
p185
aVhow to deal with matters that seem uninteresting, like compliance.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, take a look at what a typical test looks like.
p188
aVPrick a finger, you get some blood \u2014 about 50 microliters.
p189
aVThat's about all you're going to get,
p190
aVbecause you can't use the usual sort of systems.
p191
aVYou can't manipulate it very well;
p192
aVI'll show something about that in a moment.
p193
aVSo you take the drop of blood, no further manipulations,
p194
aVyou put it on a little device,
p195
aVthe device filters out the blood cells, lets the serum go through,
p196
aVand you get a series of colors down in the bottom there.
p197
aVAnd the colors indicate "disease" or "normal."
p198
aVBut even that's complicated,
p199
aVbecause to me, colors might indicate "normal,"
p200
aVbut after all, we're all suffering from probably an excess of education.
p201
aa(lp202
VWhat do you do about something which requires quantitative analysis?
p203
aVAnd so the solution that we and many other people
p204
aVare thinking about there,
p205
aVand at this point, there is a dramatic flourish,
p206
aVand out comes the universal solution to everything these days,
p207
aVwhich is a cell phone \u2014
p208
aVin this particular case, a camera phone.
p209
aVThey're everywhere \u2014 six billion a month in India.
p210
aVAnd the idea is that what one does is to take the device,
p211
aVyou dip it, you develop the color,
p212
aVyou take a picture, the picture goes to a central laboratory.
p213
aVYou don't have to send out a doctor,
p214
aVyou send out somebody who can just take the sample,
p215
aVand in the clinic either a doctor, or ideally, a computer in this case,
p216
aVdoes the analysis.
p217
aVTurns out to work actually quite well,
p218
aVparticularly when your color printer has printed the color bars
p219
aVthat indicate how things work.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo my view of the health care worker of the future
p222
aVis not a doctor, but an 18-year-old,
p223
aVotherwise unemployed, who has two things:
p224
aVa backpack full of these tests and a lancet
p225
aVto occasionally take a blood sample,
p226
aVand an AK-47.
p227
aVAnd these are the things that get him through his day.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VThere's another very interesting connection here,
p232
aVand that is, that what one wants to do is pass through useful information
p233
aVover what is generally a pretty awful telephone system.
p234
aVIt turns out there's an enormous amount of information
p235
aValready available on that subject, which is the Mars Rover problem.
p236
aVHow do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars
p237
aVif you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with?
p238
aVAnd the answer is not complicated,
p239
aVbut it's one which I don't want to go through here,
p240
aVother than to say that the communication systems for doing this
p241
aVare really pretty well understood.
p242
aa(lp243
VAlso, a fact which you may not know
p244
aVis that the compute capability of this thing is not so different
p245
aVfrom the compute capability of your desktop computer.
p246
aVThis is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped.
p247
aVI don't know whether the idea of one computer, one child
p248
aVmakes any sense.
p249
aVHere's the computer of the future,
p250
aVbecause this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous.
p251
aa(lp252
VAll right, let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices.
p253
aVAnd we'll start by posing a little problem.
p254
aVWhat you see here is another centimeter-sized device,
p255
aVand the different colors are different colors of dye.
p256
aVAnd you notice something
p257
aVwhich might strike you as a little bit interesting,
p258
aVwhich is, the yellow seems to disappear,
p259
aVget through the blue, and then get through the red.
p260
aVHow does that happen?
p261
aVHow do you make something flow through something?
p262
aVAnd, of course the answer is, "You don't."
p263
aVYou make it flow under and over.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut now the question is:
p266
aVHow do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper?
p267
aVThe answer is that what you do \u2014
p268
aVand the details are not terribly important here \u2014
p269
aVis to make something more elaborate:
p270
aVYou take several different layers of paper,
p271
aVeach one containing its own little fluid system,
p272
aVand you separate them by pieces of, literally, double-sided carpet tape,
p273
aVthe stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor.
p274
aVAnd the fluid will flow from one layer into the next.
p275
aVIt distributes itself, flows through further holes,
p276
aVdistributes itself.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd what you see, at the lower right-hand side there,
p279
aVis a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top,
p280
aVand it has gone through and distributed itself
p281
aVinto these 16 holes on the bottom,
p282
aVin a piece of paper \u2014 basically, it looks like a chip,
p283
aVtwo pieces of paper thick.
p284
aVAnd in this particular case,
p285
aVwe were just interested in the replicability of that.
p286
aVBut that is, in principle, the way you solve
p287
aVthe "fever of unexplained origin" problem,
p288
aVbecause each one of those spots then becomes a test
p289
aVfor a particular set of markers of disease,
p290
aVand this will work in due course.
p291
aa(lp292
VHere is an example of a slightly more complicated device.
p293
aVThere's the chip.
p294
aVYou dip in a corner.
p295
aVThe fluid goes into the center.
p296
aVIt distributes itself out into these various wells or holes
p297
aVand turns color,
p298
aVall done with paper and carpet tape.
p299
aVSo it's, I think, as low-cost
p300
aVas we're likely to be able to come up and make things.
p301
aa(lp302
VNow, I have two last little stories to tell you
p303
aVin finishing off this business.
p304
aVThis is one:
p305
aVOne of the things you occasionally need to do
p306
aVis separate blood cells from serum.
p307
aVAnd the question was,
p308
aVhere we do it by taking a sample,
p309
aVwe put it in a centrifuge, we spin it,
p310
aVand you get blood cells out.
p311
aVTerrific.
p312
aVWhat happens if you don't have electricity, a centrifuge, and whatever?
p313
aVAnd we thought for a while of how you might do this,
p314
aVand the way, in fact, you do it, is what's shown here.
p315
aVYou get an eggbeater, which is everywhere, and you saw off a blade,
p316
aVand then you take tubing, and you stick it on that.
p317
aVYou put the blood in, somebody sits there and spins it.
p318
aVIt works really, really well.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd we sat down, we did the physics of eggbeaters
p321
aVand self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing,
p322
aVand sent it off to a journal.
p323
aVWe were very proud of this,
p324
aVparticularly the title, which was "Eggbeater as Centrifuge."
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd we sent it off,
p329
aVand by return mail, it came back.
p330
aVI called up the editor and I said,
p331
aV"What's going on? How is this possible?"
p332
aVThe editor said, with enormous disdain,
p333
aV"I read this.
p334
aVAnd we're not going to publish it, because we only publish science."
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd it's an important issue,
p339
aVbecause it means that we have to, as a society,
p340
aVthink about what we value.
p341
aVAnd if it's just papers and Phys. Rev. letters,
p342
aVwe've got a problem.
p343
aa(lp344
VHere is another example of something which is \u2014
p345
aVthis is a little spectrophotometer.
p346
aVIt measures the absorption of light in a sample.
p347
aVThe neat thing about this is,
p348
aVyou have a light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz,
p349
aVanother light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz,
p350
aVand so you can run this system in broad daylight.
p351
aVIt performs about equivalently
p352
aVto a system that's on the order of 100,000 dollars.
p353
aVIt costs 50 dollars.
p354
aVWe can probably make it for 50 cents if we put our mind to it.
p355
aVWhy doesn't somebody do it?
p356
aVThe answer is:
p357
aVHow do you make a profit in a capitalist system, doing that?
p358
aVInteresting problem.
p359
aa(lp360
VSo, let me finish by saying that we've thought about this
p361
aVas a kind of engineering problem.
p362
aVAnd we've asked: What is the scientific unifying idea here?
p363
aVAnd we've decided we should think about this
p364
aVnot so much in terms of cost, but in terms of simplicity.
p365
aVSimplicity is a neat word.
p366
aVYou've got to think about what simplicity means.
p367
aVI know what it is,
p368
aVbut I don't actually know what it means.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo I actually was interested enough in this
p371
aVto put together several groups of people.
p372
aVThe most recent involved a couple of people at MIT,
p373
aVone of them being an exceptionally bright kid
p374
aVwho is one of the very few people I would think of
p375
aVwho's an authentic genius.
p376
aVWe all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity.
p377
aVAnd I want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought.
p378
aa(lp379
V[What is simplicity?
p380
aV"It's impossible to f..k it up"]
p381
aa(lp382
V(Laughter)
p383
aa(lp384
VSo, in a sense, you get what you pay for.
p385
aa(lp386
VThank you very much.

VFor the last year,
p5
aVeveryone's been watching the same show,
p6
aVand I'm not talking about "Game of Thrones,"
p7
aVbut a horrifying, real-life drama
p8
aVthat's proved too fascinating to turn off.
p9
aVIt's a show produced by murderers
p10
aVand shared around the world via the Internet.
p11
aVTheir names have become familiar:
p12
aVJames Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig,
p13
aVHaruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo.
p14
aa(lp15
VTheir beheadings by the Islamic State
p16
aVwere barbaric,
p17
aVbut if we think they were archaic,
p18
aVfrom a remote, obscure age,
p19
aVthen we're wrong.
p20
aVThey were uniquely modern,
p21
aVbecause the murderers acted knowing well
p22
aVthat millions of people would tune in to watch.
p23
aa(lp24
VThe headlines called them savages and barbarians,
p25
aVbecause the image of one man overpowering another,
p26
aVkilling him with a knife to the throat,
p27
aVconforms to our idea of ancient, primitive practices,
p28
aVthe polar opposite of our urban, civilized ways.
p29
aVWe don't do things like that.
p30
aVBut that's the irony.
p31
aVWe think a beheading has nothing to do with us,
p32
aVeven as we click on the screen to watch.
p33
aVBut it is to do with us.
p34
aVThe Islamic State beheadings
p35
aVare not ancient or remote.
p36
aVThey're a global, 21st century event,
p37
aVa 21st century event that takes place in our living rooms, at our desks,
p38
aVon our computer screens.
p39
aVThey're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us.
p40
aVAnd whether we like it or not,
p41
aVeveryone who watches is a part of the show.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd lots of people watch.
p44
aVWe don't know exactly how many.
p45
aVObviously, it's difficult to calculate.
p46
aVBut a poll taken in the UK, for example, in August 2014,
p47
aVestimated that 1.2 million people
p48
aVhad watched the beheading of James Foley
p49
aVin the few days after it was released.
p50
aVAnd that's just the first few days,
p51
aVand just Britain.
p52
aVA similar poll taken in the United States
p53
aVin November 2014
p54
aVfound that nine percent of those surveyed
p55
aVhad watched beheading videos,
p56
aVand a further 23 percent
p57
aVhad watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown.
p58
aVNine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch,
p59
aVbut it's still a very large crowd.
p60
aVAnd of course that crowd is growing all the time,
p61
aVbecause every week, every month,
p62
aVmore people will keep downloading and keep watching.
p63
aa(lp64
VIf we go back 11 years,
p65
aVbefore sites like YouTube and Facebook were born,
p66
aVit was a similar story.
p67
aVWhen innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl,
p68
aVNick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded,
p69
aVthose videos were shown during the Iraq War.
p70
aa(lp71
VNick Berg's beheading
p72
aVquickly became one of the most searched for items on the Internet.
p73
aVWithin a day, it was the top search term
p74
aVacross search engines like Google, Lycos, Yahoo.
p75
aVIn the week after Nick Berg's beheading,
p76
aVthese were the top 10 search terms in the United States.
p77
aVThe Berg beheading video remained the most popular search term for a week,
p78
aVand it was the second most popular search term for the whole month of May,
p79
aVrunner-up only to "American Idol."
p80
aVThe al-Qaeda-linked website that first showed Nick Berg's beheading
p81
aVhad to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site.
p82
aVOne Dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures
p83
aVrose from 300,000 to 750,000
p84
aVevery time a beheading in Iraq was shown.
p85
aVHe told reporters 18 months later
p86
aVthat it had been downloaded many millions of times,
p87
aVand that's just one website.
p88
aVA similar pattern was seen again and again
p89
aVwhen videos of beheadings were released during the Iraq War.
p90
aa(lp91
VSocial media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before,
p92
aVbut if we take another step back in history,
p93
aVwe'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd
p94
aVin our history of beheadings as public spectacle.
p95
aVAs soon as the camera appeared on the scene,
p96
aVa full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939,
p97
aVit had an immediate and unequivocal effect.
p98
aa(lp99
VThat day, the first film of a public beheading was created in France.
p100
aVIt was the execution, the guillotining, of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann,
p101
aVoutside the prison Saint-Pierre in Versailles.
p102
aVWeidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn,
p103
aVas was customary at the time,
p104
aVbut his executioner was new to the job,
p105
aVand he'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare.
p106
aVSo Weidmann was executed at 4:30 in the morning,
p107
aVby which time on a June morning,
p108
aVthere was enough light to take photographs,
p109
aVand a spectator in the crowd filmed the event,
p110
aVunbeknownst to the authorities.
p111
aVSeveral still photographs were taken as well,
p112
aVand you can still watch the film online today
p113
aVand look at the photographs.
p114
aVThe crowd on the day of Weidmann's execution
p115
aVwas called "unruly" and "disgusting" by the press,
p116
aVbut that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people
p117
aVwho could now study the action
p118
aVover and over again,
p119
aVfreeze-framed in every detail.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before,
p122
aVbut it's not just about the camera.
p123
aVIf we take a bigger leap back in history,
p124
aVwe'll see that for as long as there have been
p125
aVpublic judicial executions and beheadings,
p126
aVthere have been the crowds to see them.
p127
aVIn London, as late as the early 19th century,
p128
aVthere might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging.
p129
aVThere could be 40,000 or 50,000 to see a famous criminal killed.
p130
aVAnd a beheading, which was a rare event in England at the time,
p131
aVattracted even more.
p132
aa(lp133
VIn May 1820,
p134
aVfive men known as the Cato Street Conspirators
p135
aVwere executed in London for plotting
p136
aVto assassinate members of the British government.
p137
aVThey were hung and then decapitated.
p138
aVIt was a gruesome scene.
p139
aVEach man's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd.
p140
aVAnd 100,000 people,
p141
aVthat's 10,000 more than can fit into Wembley Stadium,
p142
aVhad turned out to watch.
p143
aVThe streets were packed.
p144
aVPeople had rented out windows and rooftops.
p145
aVPeople had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street.
p146
aVPeople climbed lamp posts.
p147
aVPeople had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days.
p148
aa(lp149
VEvidence suggests that throughout our history
p150
aVof public beheadings and public executions,
p151
aVthe vast majority of the people who come to see
p152
aVare either enthusiastic or, at best, unmoved.
p153
aVDisgust has been comparatively rare,
p154
aVand even when people are disgusted and are horrified,
p155
aVit doesn't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch.
p156
aa(lp157
VPerhaps the most striking example
p158
aVof the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved
p159
aVand even be disappointed
p160
aVwas the introduction in France in 1792 of the guillotine,
p161
aVthat famous decapitation machine.
p162
aVTo us in the 21st century,
p163
aVthe guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption,
p164
aVbut to the first crowds who saw it, it was actually a disappointment.
p165
aVThey were used to seeing long, drawn-out, torturous executions on the scaffold,
p166
aVwhere people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly.
p167
aVTo them, watching the guillotine in action,
p168
aVit was so quick, there was nothing to see.
p169
aVThe blade fell, the head fell into a basket, out of sight immediately,
p170
aVand they called out,
p171
aV"Give me back my gallows, give me back my wooden gallows."
p172
aa(lp173
VThe end of torturous public judicial executions in Europe and America
p174
aVwas partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal,
p175
aVbut it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave
p176
aVin the way that they should.
p177
aVAll too often, execution day
p178
aVwas more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony.
p179
aa(lp180
VToday, a public judicial execution in Europe or America is unthinkable,
p181
aVbut there are other scenarios that should make us cautious
p182
aVabout thinking that things are different now
p183
aVand we don't behave like that anymore.
p184
aa(lp185
VTake, for example, the incidents of suicide baiting.
p186
aVThis is when a crowd gathers
p187
aVto watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building
p188
aVin order to kill themselves,
p189
aVand people in the crowd shout and jeer,
p190
aV"Get on with it! Go on and jump!"
p191
aVThis is a well-recognized phenomenon.
p192
aVOne paper in 1981 found that in 10 out of 21 threatened suicide attempts,
p193
aVthere was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a crowd.
p194
aVAnd there have been incidents reported in the press this year.
p195
aVThis was a very widely reported incident
p196
aVin Telford and Shropshire in March this year.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd when it happens today,
p199
aVpeople take photographs and they take videos on their phones
p200
aVand they post those videos online.
p201
aVWhen it comes to brutal murderers who post their beheading videos,
p202
aVthe Internet has created a new kind of crowd.
p203
aVToday, the action takes place in a distant time and place,
p204
aVwhich gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what's happening,
p205
aVa sense of separation.
p206
aVIt's nothing to do with me.
p207
aVIt's already happened.
p208
aVWe are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy.
p209
aVToday, we are all offered front row seats.
p210
aVWe can all watch in private, in our own time and space,
p211
aVand no one need ever know that we've clicked on the screen to watch.
p212
aa(lp213
VThis sense of separation \u2014
p214
aVfrom other people, from the event itself \u2014
p215
aVseems to be key to understanding our ability to watch,
p216
aVand there are several ways
p217
aVin which the Internet creates a sense of detachment
p218
aVthat seems to erode individual moral responsibility.
p219
aVOur activities online are often contrasted with real life,
p220
aVas though the things we do online are somehow less real.
p221
aVWe feel less accountable for our actions
p222
aVwhen we interact online.
p223
aVThere's a sense of anonymity, a sense of invisibility,
p224
aVso we feel less accountable for our behavior.
p225
aVThe Internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently,
p226
aVthings that we would usually avoid in everyday life.
p227
aVToday, a video can start playing before you even know what you're watching.
p228
aVOr you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn't look at in everyday life
p229
aVor you wouldn't look at if you were with other people at the time.
p230
aVAnd when the action is pre-recorded
p231
aVand takes place in a distant time and space,
p232
aVwatching seems like a passive activity.
p233
aVThere's nothing I can do about it now.
p234
aVIt's already happened.
p235
aa(lp236
VAll these things make it easier as an Internet user
p237
aVfor us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death,
p238
aVto push our personal boundaries,
p239
aVto test our sense of shock, to explore our sense of shock.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut we're not passive when we watch.
p242
aVOn the contrary, we're fulfilling the murderer's desire to be seen.
p243
aVWhen the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless,
p244
aVhe or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer's show.
p245
aVUnlike a trophy head that's taken in battle,
p246
aVthat represents the luck and skill it takes to win a fight,
p247
aVwhen a beheading is staged,
p248
aVwhen it's essentially a piece of theater,
p249
aVthe power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs.
p250
aVIn other words, watching is very much part of the event.
p251
aVThe event no longer takes place in a single location
p252
aVat a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to.
p253
aVNow the event is stretched out in time and place,
p254
aVand everyone who watches plays their part.
p255
aa(lp256
VWe should stop watching,
p257
aVbut we know we won't.
p258
aVHistory tells us we won't,
p259
aVand the killers know it too.
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Applause)
p264
aa(lp265
VBruno Giussani: Thank you. Let me get this back. Thank you.
p266
aVLet's move here. While they install for the next performance,
p267
aVI want to ask you the question that probably many here have,
p268
aVwhich is how did you get interested in this topic?
p269
aa(lp270
VFrances Larson: I used to work at a museum
p271
aVcalled the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford,
p272
aVwhich was famous for its display of shrunken heads from South America.
p273
aVPeople used to say, "Oh, the shrunken head museum, the shrunken head museum!"
p274
aVAnd at the time, I was working on the history
p275
aVof scientific collections of skulls.
p276
aVI was working on the cranial collections,
p277
aVand it just struck me as ironic
p278
aVthat here were people coming to see this gory, primitive, savage culture
p279
aVthat they were almost fantasizing about and creating
p280
aVwithout really understanding what they were seeing,
p281
aVand all the while these vast \u2014 I mean hundreds of thousands
p282
aVof skulls in our museums, all across Europe and the States \u2014
p283
aVwere kind of upholding this Enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality.
p284
aVSo I wanted to kind of twist it round and say, "Let's look at us."
p285
aVWe're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads.
p286
aVLet's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things.
p287
aVBG: Thank you for sharing that.
p288
aa(lp289
VFL: Thank you.

VHow do you find a dinosaur?
p5
aVSounds impossible, doesn't it?
p6
aVIt's not.
p7
aVAnd the answer relies on a formula that all paleontologists use.
p8
aVAnd I'm going to tell you the secret.
p9
aa(lp10
VFirst, find rocks of the right age.
p11
aVSecond, those rocks must be sedimentary rocks.
p12
aVAnd third, layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed.
p13
aVThat's it.
p14
aVFind those three things and get yourself on the ground,
p15
aVchances are good that you will find fossils.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow let me break down this formula.
p18
aVOrganisms exist only during certain geological intervals.
p19
aVSo you have to find rocks of the right age,
p20
aVdepending on what your interests are.
p21
aVIf you want to find trilobites,
p22
aVyou have to find the really, really old rocks of the Paleozoic \u2014
p23
aVrocks between a half a billion and a quarter-billion years old.
p24
aVNow, if you want to find dinosaurs,
p25
aVdon't look in the Paleozoic, you won't find them.
p26
aVThey hadn't evolved yet.
p27
aVYou have to find the younger rocks of the Mesozoic,
p28
aVand in the case of dinosaurs,
p29
aVbetween 235 and 66 million years ago.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, it's fairly easy to find rocks of the right age at this point,
p32
aVbecause the Earth is, to a coarse degree,
p33
aVgeologically mapped.
p34
aVThis is hard-won information.
p35
aVThe annals of Earth history are written in rocks,
p36
aVone chapter upon the next,
p37
aVsuch that the oldest pages are on bottom
p38
aVand the youngest on top.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, were it quite that easy, geologists would rejoice.
p41
aVIt's not.
p42
aVThe library of Earth is an old one.
p43
aVIt has no librarian to impose order.
p44
aVOperating over vast swaths of time,
p45
aVmyriad geological processes offer every possible insult
p46
aVto the rocks of ages.
p47
aVMost pages are destroyed soon after being written.
p48
aVSome pages are overwritten,
p49
aVcreating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests of long-gone landscapes.
p50
aVPages that do find sanctuary under the advancing sands of time
p51
aVare never truly safe.
p52
aVUnlike the Moon \u2014 our dead, rocky companion \u2014
p53
aVthe Earth is alive, pulsing with creative and destructive forces
p54
aVthat power its geological metabolism.
p55
aVLunar rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts
p56
aVall date back to about the age of the Solar System.
p57
aVMoon rocks are forever.
p58
aVEarth rocks, on the other hand, face the perils of a living lithosphere.
p59
aVAll will suffer ruination,
p60
aVthrough some combination of mutilation, compression,
p61
aVfolding, tearing, scorching and baking.
p62
aa(lp63
VThus, the volumes of Earth history are incomplete and disheveled.
p64
aVThe library is vast and magnificent \u2014
p65
aVbut decrepit.
p66
aVAnd it was this tattered complexity in the rock record
p67
aVthat obscured its meaning until relatively recently.
p68
aVNature provided no card catalog for geologists \u2014
p69
aVthis would have to be invented.
p70
aVFive thousand years after the Sumerians learned to record their thoughts
p71
aVon clay tablets,
p72
aVthe Earth's volumes remained inscrutable to humans.
p73
aVWe were geologically illiterate,
p74
aVunaware of the antiquity of our own planet
p75
aVand ignorant of our connection
p76
aVto deep time.
p77
aa(lp78
VIt wasn't until the turn of the 19th century
p79
aVthat our blinders were removed,
p80
aVfirst, with the publication of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth,"
p81
aVin which he told us that the Earth reveals no vestige of a beginning
p82
aVand no prospect of an end;
p83
aVand then, with the printing of William Smith's map of Britain,
p84
aVthe first country-scale geological map,
p85
aVgiving us for the first time
p86
aVpredictive insight into where certain types of rocks might occur.
p87
aVAfter that, you could say things like,
p88
aV"If we go over there, we should be in the Jurassic,"
p89
aVor, "If we go up over that hill, we should find the Cretaceous."
p90
aa(lp91
VSo now, if you want to find trilobites,
p92
aVget yourself a good geological map
p93
aVand go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.
p94
aVIf you want to find dinosaurs like I do,
p95
aVfind the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.
p96
aVNow of course, you can only make a fossil in a sedimentary rock,
p97
aVa rock made by sand and mud.
p98
aVYou can't have a fossil
p99
aVin an igneous rock formed by magma, like a granite,
p100
aVor in a metamorphic rock that's been heated and squeezed.
p101
aVAnd you have to get yourself in a desert.
p102
aVIt's not that dinosaurs particularly lived in deserts;
p103
aVthey lived on every land mass
p104
aVand in every imaginable environment.
p105
aVIt's that you need to go to a place that's a desert today,
p106
aVa place that doesn't have too many plants covering up the rocks,
p107
aVand a place where erosion is always exposing new bones at the surface.
p108
aVSo find those three things:
p109
aVrocks of the right age,
p110
aVthat are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,
p111
aVand get yourself on the ground,
p112
aVand you literally walk
p113
aVuntil you see a bone sticking out of the rock.
p114
aa(lp115
VHere's a picture that I took in Southern Patagonia.
p116
aVEvery pebble that you see on the ground there
p117
aVis a piece of dinosaur bone.
p118
aVSo when you're in that right situation,
p119
aVit's not a question of whether you'll find fossils or not;
p120
aVyou're going to find fossils.
p121
aVThe question is: Will you find something that is scientifically significant?
p122
aVAnd to help with that, I'm going to add a fourth part to our formula,
p123
aVwhich is this:
p124
aVget as far away from other paleontologists as possible.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VIt's not that I don't like other paleontologists.
p129
aVWhen you go to a place that's relatively unexplored,
p130
aVyou have a much better chance of not only finding fossils
p131
aVbut of finding something that's new to science.
p132
aVSo that's my formula for finding dinosaurs,
p133
aVand I've applied it all around the world.
p134
aa(lp135
VIn the austral summer of 2004,
p136
aVI went to the bottom of South America,
p137
aVto the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,
p138
aVto prospect for dinosaurs:
p139
aVa place that had terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the right age,
p140
aVin a desert,
p141
aVa place that had been barely visited by paleontologists.
p142
aVAnd we found this.
p143
aVThis is a femur, a thigh bone,
p144
aVof a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.
p145
aVThat bone is 2.2 meters across.
p146
aVThat's over seven feet long.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, unfortunately, that bone was isolated.
p149
aVWe dug and dug and dug, and there wasn't another bone around.
p150
aVBut it made us hungry to go back the next year for more.
p151
aVAnd on the first day of that next field season,
p152
aVI found this: another two-meter femur,
p153
aVonly this time not isolated,
p154
aVthis time associated with 145 other bones
p155
aVof a giant plant eater.
p156
aVAnd after three more hard, really brutal field seasons,
p157
aVthe quarry came to look like this.
p158
aVAnd there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me.
p159
aVThe giant that lay in this grave, the new species of dinosaur,
p160
aVwe would eventually call "Dreadnoughtus schrani."
p161
aVDreadnoughtus was 85 feet from snout to tail.
p162
aVIt stood two-and-a-half stories at the shoulder,
p163
aVand all fleshed out in life, it weighed 65 tons.
p164
aVPeople ask me sometimes, "Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?"
p165
aVThat's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow, one of the really cool things about being a paleontologist
p168
aVis when you find a new species, you get to name it.
p169
aVAnd I've always thought it a shame that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs
p170
aVare too often portrayed as passive, lumbering platters of meat
p171
aVon the landscape.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VThey're not.
p176
aVBig herbivores can be surly, and they can be territorial \u2014
p177
aVyou do not want to mess with a hippo or a rhino or a water buffalo.
p178
aVThe bison in Yellowstone injure far more people than do the grizzly bears.
p179
aVSo can you imagine a big bull, 65-ton Dreadnoughtus
p180
aVin the breeding season,
p181
aVdefending a territory?
p182
aVThat animal would have been incredibly dangerous,
p183
aVa menace to all around, and itself would have had nothing to fear.
p184
aVAnd thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus,"
p185
aVor, "fears nothing."
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, to grow so large,
p188
aVan animal like Dreadnoughtus would've had to have been
p189
aVa model of efficiency.
p190
aVThat long neck and long tail help it radiate heat into the environment,
p191
aVpassively controlling its temperature.
p192
aVAnd that long neck also serves as a super-efficient feeding mechanism.
p193
aVDreadnoughtus could stand in one place and with that neck
p194
aVclear out a huge envelope of vegetation,
p195
aVtaking in tens of thousands of calories while expending very few.
p196
aVAnd these animals evolved a bulldog-like wide-gait stance,
p197
aVgiving them immense stability,
p198
aVbecause when you're 65 tons, when you're literally as big as a house,
p199
aVthe penalty for falling over
p200
aVis death.
p201
aVYeah, these animals are big and tough,
p202
aVbut they won't take a blow like that.
p203
aVDreadnoughtus falls over, ribs break and pierce lungs.
p204
aVOrgans burst.
p205
aVIf you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,
p206
aVyou don't get to fall down in life \u2014 even once.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow, after this particular Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried
p209
aVand de-fleshed by a multitude of bacteria, worms and insects,
p210
aVits bones underwent a brief metamorphosis,
p211
aVexchanging molecules with the groundwater
p212
aVand becoming more and more like the entombing rock.
p213
aVAs layer upon layer of sediment accumulated,
p214
aVpressure from all sides weighed in like a stony glove
p215
aVwhose firm and enduring grip held each bone in a stabilizing embrace.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd then came the long ...
p218
aVnothing.
p219
aVEpoch after epoch of sameness,
p220
aVnonevents without number.
p221
aVAll the while, the skeleton lay everlasting and unchanging
p222
aVin perfect equilibrium
p223
aVwithin its rocky grave.
p224
aVMeanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.
p225
aVThe dinosaurs would reign for another 12 million years
p226
aVbefore their hegemony was snuffed out in a fiery apocalypse.
p227
aVThe continents drifted. The mammals rose.
p228
aVThe Ice Age came.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd then, in East Africa,
p231
aVan unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought.
p232
aVThese brainy primates were not particularly fast or strong.
p233
aVBut they excelled at covering ground,
p234
aVand in a remarkable diaspora
p235
aVsurpassing even the dinosaurs' record of territorial conquest,
p236
aVthey dispersed across the planet,
p237
aVravishing every ecosystem they encountered,
p238
aValong the way, inventing culture and metalworking and painting
p239
aVand dance and music
p240
aVand science
p241
aVand rocket ships that would eventually take 12 particularly excellent apes
p242
aVto the surface of the Moon.
p243
aa(lp244
VWith seven billion peripatetic Homo sapiens on the planet,
p245
aVit was perhaps inevitable
p246
aVthat one of them would eventually trod on the grave of the magnificent titan
p247
aVburied beneath the badlands of Southern Patagonia.
p248
aVI was that ape.
p249
aVAnd standing there, alone in the desert,
p250
aVit was not lost on me
p251
aVthat the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record
p252
aVis vanishingly small.
p253
aVBut the Earth is very, very old.
p254
aVAnd over vast tracts of time, the improbable becomes the probable.
p255
aVThat's the magic of the geological record.
p256
aVThus, multitudinous creatures living and dying on an old planet
p257
aVleave behind immense numbers of fossils,
p258
aVeach one a small miracle,
p259
aVbut collectively, inevitable.
p260
aa(lp261
VSixty-six million years ago, an asteroid hits the Earth
p262
aVand wipes out the dinosaurs.
p263
aVThis easily might not have been.
p264
aVBut we only get one history, and it's the one that we have.
p265
aVBut this particular reality was not inevitable.
p266
aVThe tiniest perturbation of that asteroid far from Earth
p267
aVwould have caused it to miss our planet by a wide margin.
p268
aVThe pivotal, calamitous day during which the dinosaurs were wiped out,
p269
aVsetting the stage for the modern world as we know it
p270
aVdidn't have to be.
p271
aVIt could've just been another day \u2014
p272
aVa Thursday, perhaps \u2014
p273
aVamong the 63 billion days already enjoyed by the dinosaurs.
p274
aVBut over geological time,
p275
aVimprobable, nearly impossible events
p276
aVdo occur.
p277
aVAlong the path from our wormy, Cambrian ancestors
p278
aVto primates dressed in suits,
p279
aVinnumerable forks in the road led us to this very particular reality.
p280
aVThe bones of Dreadnoughtus lay underground for 77 million years.
p281
aVWho could have imagined
p282
aVthat a single species of shrew-like mammal
p283
aVliving in the cracks of the dinosaur world
p284
aVwould evolve into sentient beings
p285
aVcapable of characterizing and understanding
p286
aVthe very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?
p287
aa(lp288
VI once stood at the head of the Missouri River
p289
aVand bestraddled it.
p290
aVThere, it's nothing more than a gurgle of water
p291
aVthat issues forth from beneath a rock in a boulder in a pasture,
p292
aVhigh in the Bitterroot Mountains.
p293
aVThe stream next to it runs a few hundred yards
p294
aVand ends in a small pond.
p295
aVThose two streams \u2014 they look identical.
p296
aVBut one is an anonymous trickle of water,
p297
aVand the other is the Missouri River.
p298
aVNow go down to the mouth of the Missouri, near St. Louis,
p299
aVand it's pretty obvious that that river is a big deal.
p300
aVBut go up into the Bitterroots and look at the Missouri,
p301
aVand human prospection does not allow us to see it as anything special.
p302
aVNow go back to the Cretaceous Period
p303
aVand look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.
p304
aVYou would never guess
p305
aVthat they would amount to anything special,
p306
aVand they probably wouldn't have,
p307
aVwere it not for that pesky asteroid.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow, make a thousand more worlds and a thousand more solar systems
p310
aVand let them run.
p311
aVYou will never get the same result.
p312
aVNo doubt, those worlds would be both amazing and amazingly improbable,
p313
aVbut they would not be our world and they would not have our history.
p314
aVThere are an infinite number of histories that we could've had.
p315
aVWe only get one, and wow, did we ever get a good one.
p316
aVDinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.
p317
aVSea monsters like the mosasaur were real.
p318
aVDragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle and pill bugs the length of a car
p319
aVreally existed.
p320
aa(lp321
VWhy study the ancient past?
p322
aVBecause it gives us perspective
p323
aVand humility.
p324
aVThe dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction,
p325
aVsnuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own.
p326
aVThey didn't see it coming, and they didn't have a choice.
p327
aVWe, on the other hand, do have a choice.
p328
aVAnd the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet
p329
aVis both precarious and potentially fleeting.
p330
aVRight now, our species is propagating an environmental disaster
p331
aVof geological proportions that is so broad and so severe,
p332
aVit can rightly be called the sixth extinction.
p333
aVOnly unlike the dinosaurs,
p334
aVwe can see it coming.
p335
aVAnd unlike the dinosaurs,
p336
aVwe can do something about it.
p337
aVThat choice is ours.
p338
aa(lp339
VThank you.

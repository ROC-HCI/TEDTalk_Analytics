VImagine that you invented a device
p5
aVthat can record my memories,
p6
aVmy dreams, my ideas,
p7
aVand transmit them to your brain.
p8
aVThat would be a game-changing technology, right?
p9
aVBut in fact, we already possess this device,
p10
aVand it's called human communication system
p11
aVand effective storytelling.
p12
aVTo understand how this device works,
p13
aVwe have to look into our brains.
p14
aVAnd we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow we have to ask
p17
aVhow these neuron patterns in my brain
p18
aVthat are associated with my memories and ideas
p19
aVare transmitted into your brains.
p20
aVAnd we think there are two factors that enable us to communicate.
p21
aVFirst, your brain is now physically coupled to the sound wave
p22
aVthat I'm transmitting to your brain.
p23
aVAnd second, we developed a common neural protocol
p24
aVthat enabled us to communicate.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo how do we know that?
p27
aVIn my lab in Princeton,
p28
aVwe bring people to the fMRI scanner and we scan their brains
p29
aVwhile they are either telling or listening to real-life stories.
p30
aVAnd to give you a sense of the stimulus we are using,
p31
aVlet me play 20 seconds from a story that we used,
p32
aVtold by a very talented storyteller,
p33
aVJim O'Grady.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good,
p36
aVand then I start to make it better \u2014
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
Vby adding an element of embellishment.
p41
aVReporters call this "making shit up."
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd they recommend against crossing that line.
p46
aVBut I had just seen the line crossed between a high-powered dean
p47
aVand assault with a pastry.
p48
aVAnd I kinda liked it."
p49
aa(lp50
VUri Hasson: OK, so now let's look into your brain
p51
aVand see what's happening when you listen to these kinds of stories.
p52
aVAnd let's start simple \u2014 let's start with one listener and one brain area:
p53
aVthe auditory cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear.
p54
aVAnd as you can see, in this particular brain area,
p55
aVthe responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding.
p56
aVNow we can take these responses
p57
aVand compare them to the responses in other listeners
p58
aVin the same brain area.
p59
aVAnd we can ask:
p60
aVHow similar are the responses across all listeners?
p61
aa(lp62
VSo here you can see five listeners.
p63
aVAnd we start to scan their brains before the story starts,
p64
aVwhen they're simply lying in the dark and waiting for the story to begin.
p65
aVAs you can see,
p66
aVthe brain area is going up and down in each one of them,
p67
aVbut the responses are very different,
p68
aVand not in sync.
p69
aVHowever, immediately as the story is starting,
p70
aVsomething amazing is happening.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good,
p73
aVand then I start to make it \u2014
p74
aa(lp75
VUH: Suddenly, you can see that the responses in all of the subjects
p76
aVlock to the story,
p77
aVand now they are going up and down in a very similar way
p78
aVacross all listeners.
p79
aVAnd in fact, this is exactly what is happening now in your brains
p80
aVwhen you listen to my sound speaking.
p81
aVWe call this effect "neural entrainment."
p82
aVAnd to explain to you what is neural entrainment,
p83
aVlet me first explain what is physical entrainment.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo, we'll look and see five metronomes.
p86
aVThink of these five metronomes as five brains.
p87
aVAnd similar to the listeners before the story starts,
p88
aVthese metronomes are going to click,
p89
aVbut they're going to click out of phase.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Clicking)
p92
aa(lp93
VNow see what will happen when I connect them together
p94
aVby placing them on these two cylinders.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Clicking)
p97
aa(lp98
VNow these two cylinders start to rotate.
p99
aVThis rotation vibration is going through the wood
p100
aVand is going to couple all the metronomes together.
p101
aVAnd now listen to the click.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Synchronized clicking)
p104
aa(lp105
VThis is what you call physical entrainment.
p106
aVNow let's go back to the brain and ask:
p107
aVWhat's driving this neural entrainment?
p108
aVIs it simply the sounds that the speaker is producing?
p109
aVOr maybe it's the words.
p110
aVOr maybe it's the meaning that the speaker is trying to convey.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo to test it, we did the following experiment.
p113
aVFirst, we took the story and played it backwards.
p114
aVAnd that preserved many of the original auditory features,
p115
aVbut removed the meaning.
p116
aVAnd it sounds something like that.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible)
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd we flashed colors in the two brains
p121
aVto indicate brain areas that respond very similarly across people.
p122
aVAnd as you can see,
p123
aVthis incoming sound induced entrainment or alignment in all of the brains
p124
aVin auditory cortices that process the sounds,
p125
aVbut it didn't spread deeper into the brain.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow we can take these sounds and build words out of it.
p128
aVSo if we take Jim O'Grady and scramble the words,
p129
aVwe'll get a list of words.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Audio) JO: ... an animal ... assorted facts ...
p132
aVand right on ... pie man ... potentially ... my stories
p133
aa(lp134
VUH: And you can see that these words start to induce alignment
p135
aVin early language areas, but not more than that.
p136
aVNow we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Audio) JO: And they recommend against crossing that line.
p139
aVHe says: "Dear Jim, Good story. Nice details.
p140
aVDidn't she only know about him through me?"
p141
aa(lp142
VUH: Now you can see that the responses in all the language areas
p143
aVthat process the incoming language
p144
aVbecome aligned or similar across all listeners.
p145
aVHowever, only when we use the full, engaging, coherent story
p146
aVdo the responses spread deeper into the brain
p147
aVinto higher-order areas,
p148
aVwhich include the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex,
p149
aVand make all of them respond very similarly.
p150
aVAnd we believe that these responses in higher-order areas are induced
p151
aVor become similar across listeners
p152
aVbecause of the meaning conveyed by the speaker,
p153
aVand not by words or sound.
p154
aVAnd if we are right, there's a strong prediction over here
p155
aVif I tell you the exact same ideas
p156
aVusing two very different sets of words,
p157
aVyour brain responses will still be similar.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd to test it, we did the following experiment in my lab.
p160
aVWe took the English story
p161
aVand translated it to Russian.
p162
aVNow you have two different sounds and linguistic systems
p163
aVthat convey the exact same meaning.
p164
aVAnd you play the English story to the English listeners
p165
aVand the Russian story to the Russian listeners,
p166
aVand we can compare their responses across the groups.
p167
aVAnd when we did that, we didn't see responses that are similar
p168
aVin auditory cortices in language,
p169
aVbecause the language and sound are very different.
p170
aVHowever, you can see that the responses in high-order areas
p171
aVwere still similar across these two groups.
p172
aVWe believe this is because they understood the story in a very similar way,
p173
aVas we confirmed, using a test after the story ended.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd we think that this alignment is necessary for communication.
p176
aVFor example, as you can tell,
p177
aVI am not a native English speaker.
p178
aVI grew up with another language,
p179
aVand the same might be for many of you in the audience.
p180
aVAnd still, we can communicate.
p181
aVHow come?
p182
aVWe think we can communicate because we have this common code
p183
aVthat presents meaning.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo far, I've only talked about what's happening in the listener's brain,
p186
aVin your brain, when you're listening to talks.
p187
aVBut what's happening in the speaker's brain, in my brain,
p188
aVwhen I'm speaking to you?
p189
aVTo look in the speaker's brain,
p190
aVwe asked the speaker to go into the scanner,
p191
aVwe scan his brain
p192
aVand then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners
p193
aVlistening to the story.
p194
aVYou have to remember that producing speech and comprehending speech
p195
aVare very different processes.
p196
aVHere we're asking: How similar are they?
p197
aVTo our surprise,
p198
aVwe saw that all these complex patterns within the listeners
p199
aVactually came from the speaker brain.
p200
aVSo production and comprehension rely on very similar processes.
p201
aVAnd we also found
p202
aVthe stronger the similarity between the listener's brain
p203
aVand the speaker's brain,
p204
aVthe better the communication.
p205
aVSo I know that if you are completely confused now,
p206
aVand I do hope that this is not the case,
p207
aVyour brain responses are very different than mine.
p208
aVBut I also know that if you really understand me now,
p209
aVthen your brain ... and your brain ... and your brain
p210
aVare really similar to mine.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, let's take all this information together and ask:
p213
aVHow can we use it to transmit a memory that I have
p214
aVfrom my brain to your brains?
p215
aVSo we did the following experiment.
p216
aVWe let people watch, for the first time in their life,
p217
aVa TV episode from the BBC series "Sherlock," while we scanned their brains.
p218
aVAnd then we asked them to go back to the scanner
p219
aVand tell the story to another person that never watched the movie.
p220
aVSo let's be specific.
p221
aVThink about this exact scene,
p222
aVwhen Sherlock is entering the cab in London
p223
aVdriven by the murderer he is looking for.
p224
aa(lp225
VWith me, as a viewer,
p226
aVthere is a specific brain pattern in my brain when I watch it.
p227
aVNow, the exact same pattern, I can reactivate in my brain again
p228
aVby telling the word: Sherlock, London, murderer.
p229
aVAnd when I'm transmitting these words to your brains now,
p230
aVyou have to reconstruct it in your mind.
p231
aVIn fact, we see that pattern emerging now in your brains.
p232
aVAnd we were really surprised to see
p233
aVthat the pattern you have now in your brains
p234
aVwhen I'm describing to you these scenes
p235
aVwould be very similar to the pattern I had when I watched this movie
p236
aVa few months ago in the scanner.
p237
aVThis starts to tell you about the mechanism
p238
aVby which we can tell stories and transmit information.
p239
aVBecause, for example,
p240
aVnow you're listening really hard and trying to understand what I'm saying.
p241
aVAnd I know that it's not easy.
p242
aVBut I hope that at one point in the talk we clicked, and you got me.
p243
aVAnd I think that in a few hours, a few days, a few months,
p244
aVyou're going to meet someone at a party,
p245
aVand you're going to tell him about this lecture,
p246
aVand suddenly it will be as if he is standing now here with us.
p247
aVNow you can see how we can take this mechanism
p248
aVand try to transmit memories and knowledge across people,
p249
aVwhich is wonderful, right?
p250
aa(lp251
VBut our ability to communicate relies on our ability
p252
aVto have common ground.
p253
aVBecause, for example,
p254
aVif I'm going to use the British synonym
p255
aV"hackney carriage" instead of "cab,"
p256
aVI know that I'm going to be misaligned with most of you in the audience.
p257
aVThis alignment depends not only on our ability
p258
aVto understand the basic concept;
p259
aVit also depends on our ability to develop common ground and understanding
p260
aVand shared belief systems.
p261
aVBecause we know that in many cases,
p262
aVpeople understand the exact same story in very different ways.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo to test it in the lab, we did the following experiment.
p265
aVWe took a story by J.D. Salinger,
p266
aVin which a husband lost track of his wife in the middle of a party,
p267
aVand he's calling his best friend, asking, "Did you see my wife?"
p268
aVFor half of the subjects,
p269
aVwe said that the wife was having an affair with the best friend.
p270
aVFor the other half,
p271
aVwe said that the wife is loyal and the husband is very jealous.
p272
aVThis one sentence before the story started
p273
aVwas enough to make the brain responses
p274
aVof all the people that believed the wife was having an affair
p275
aVbe very similar in these high-order areas
p276
aVand different than the other group.
p277
aVAnd if one sentence is enough to make your brain similar
p278
aVto people that think like you
p279
aVand very different than people that think differently than you,
p280
aVthink how this effect is going to be amplified in real life,
p281
aVwhen we are all listening to the exact same news item
p282
aVafter being exposed day after day after day
p283
aVto different media channels, like Fox News or The New York Times,
p284
aVthat give us very different perspectives on reality.
p285
aa(lp286
VSo let me summarize.
p287
aVIf everything worked as planned tonight,
p288
aVI used my ability to vocalize sound to be coupled to your brains.
p289
aVAnd I used this coupling
p290
aVto transmit my brain patterns associated with my memories and ideas
p291
aVinto your brains.
p292
aVIn this, I start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism
p293
aVby which we communicate.
p294
aVAnd we know that in the future it will enable us to improve
p295
aVand facilitate communication.
p296
aVBut these studies also reveal
p297
aVthat communication relies on a common ground.
p298
aVAnd we have to be really worried as a society
p299
aVif we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people
p300
aVthat are slightly different than us
p301
aVbecause we let a few very strong media channels
p302
aVtake control of the mic,
p303
aVand manipulate and control the way we all think.
p304
aVAnd I'm not sure how to fix it because I'm only a scientist.
p305
aVBut maybe one way to do it
p306
aVis to go back to the more natural way of communication,
p307
aVwhich is a dialogue,
p308
aVin which it's not only me speaking to you now,
p309
aVbut a more natural way of talking,
p310
aVin which I am speaking and I am listening,
p311
aVand together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas.
p312
aVBecause after all,
p313
aVthe people we are coupled to define who we are.
p314
aVAnd our desire to be coupled to another brain
p315
aVis something very basic that starts at a very early age.
p316
aa(lp317
VSo let me finish with an example from my own private life
p318
aVthat I think is a good example of how coupling to other people
p319
aVis really going to define who we are.
p320
aa(lp321
VThis my son Jonathan at a very early age.
p322
aVSee how he developed a vocal game together with my wife,
p323
aVonly from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Both vocalizing)
p326
aa(lp327
V(Laughter)
p328
aa(lp329
VNow, think how the ability of my son
p330
aVto be coupled to us and other people in his life
p331
aVis going to shape the man he is going to become.
p332
aVAnd think how you change on a daily basis
p333
aVfrom the interaction and coupling to other people in your life.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo keep being coupled to other people.
p336
aVKeep spreading your ideas,
p337
aVbecause the sum of all of us together, coupled,
p338
aVis greater than our parts.
p339
aa(lp340
VThank you.

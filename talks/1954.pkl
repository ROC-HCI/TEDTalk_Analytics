VIn many patriarchal societies and tribal societies,
p5
aVfathers are usually known by their sons,
p6
aVbut I'm one of the few fathers
p7
aVwho is known by his daughter,
p8
aVand I am proud of it.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Applause)
p11
aa(lp12
VMalala started her campaign for education
p13
aVand stood for her rights in 2007,
p14
aVand when her efforts were honored in 2011,
p15
aVand she was given the national youth peace prize,
p16
aVand she became a very famous,
p17
aVvery popular young girl of her country.
p18
aVBefore that, she was my daughter,
p19
aVbut now I am her father.
p20
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p21
aVif we glance to human history,
p22
aVthe story of women
p23
aVis the story of injustice,
p24
aVinequality,
p25
aVviolence and exploitation.
p26
aVYou see,
p27
aVin patriarchal societies,
p28
aVright from the very beginning,
p29
aVwhen a girl is born,
p30
aVher birth is not celebrated.
p31
aVShe is not welcomed,
p32
aVneither by father nor by mother.
p33
aVThe neighborhood comes
p34
aVand commiserates with the mother,
p35
aVand nobody congratulates the father.
p36
aVAnd a mother is very uncomfortable
p37
aVfor having a girl child.
p38
aVWhen she gives birth to the first girl child,
p39
aVfirst daughter, she is sad.
p40
aVWhen she gives birth to the second daughter,
p41
aVshe is shocked,
p42
aVand in the expectation of a son,
p43
aVwhen she gives birth to a third daughter,
p44
aVshe feels guilty like a criminal.
p45
aa(lp46
VNot only the mother suffers,
p47
aVbut the daughter, the newly born daughter,
p48
aVwhen she grows old,
p49
aVshe suffers too.
p50
aVAt the age of five,
p51
aVwhile she should be going to school,
p52
aVshe stays at home
p53
aVand her brothers are admitted in a school.
p54
aVUntil the age of 12, somehow,
p55
aVshe has a good life.
p56
aVShe can have fun.
p57
aVShe can play with her friends in the streets,
p58
aVand she can move around in the streets
p59
aVlike a butterfly.
p60
aVBut when she enters her teens,
p61
aVwhen she becomes 13 years old,
p62
aVshe is forbidden to go out of her home
p63
aVwithout a male escort.
p64
aVShe is confined under the four walls of her home.
p65
aVShe is no more a free individual.
p66
aVShe becomes the so-called honor
p67
aVof her father and of her brothers
p68
aVand of her family,
p69
aVand if she transgresses
p70
aVthe code of that so-called honor,
p71
aVshe could even be killed.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd it is also interesting that this so-called
p74
aVcode of honor,
p75
aVit does not only affect the life of a girl,
p76
aVit also affects the life
p77
aVof the male members of the family.
p78
aVI know a family of seven sisters and one brother,
p79
aVand that one brother,
p80
aVhe has migrated to the Gulf countries,
p81
aVto earn a living for his seven sisters
p82
aVand parents,
p83
aVbecause he thinks that it will be humiliating
p84
aVif his seven sisters learn a skill
p85
aVand they go out of the home
p86
aVand earn some livelihood.
p87
aVSo this brother,
p88
aVhe sacrifices the joys of his life
p89
aVand the happiness of his sisters
p90
aVat the altar of so-called honor.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd there is one more norm
p93
aVof the patriarchal societies
p94
aVthat is called obedience.
p95
aVA good girl is supposed to be
p96
aVvery quiet, very humble
p97
aVand very submissive.
p98
aVIt is the criteria.
p99
aVThe role model good girl should be very quiet.
p100
aVShe is supposed to be silent
p101
aVand she is supposed to accept the decisions
p102
aVof her father and mother
p103
aVand the decisions of elders,
p104
aVeven if she does not like them.
p105
aVIf she is married to a man she doesn't like
p106
aVor if she is married to an old man,
p107
aVshe has to accept,
p108
aVbecause she does not want to be dubbed
p109
aVas disobedient.
p110
aVIf she is married very early,
p111
aVshe has to accept.
p112
aVOtherwise, she will be called disobedient.
p113
aVAnd what happens at the end?
p114
aVIn the words of a poetess,
p115
aVshe is wedded, bedded,
p116
aVand then she gives birth to more sons and daughters.
p117
aVAnd it is the irony of the situation
p118
aVthat this mother,
p119
aVshe teaches the same lesson of obedience
p120
aVto her daughter
p121
aVand the same lesson of honor to her sons.
p122
aVAnd this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.
p123
aa(lp124
VLadies and gentlemen,
p125
aVthis plight of millions of women
p126
aVcould be changed
p127
aVif we think differently,
p128
aVif women and men think differently,
p129
aVif men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies
p130
aVin the developing countries,
p131
aVif they can break a few norms
p132
aVof family and society,
p133
aVif they can abolish the discriminatory laws
p134
aVof the systems in their states,
p135
aVwhich go against the basic human rights
p136
aVof the women.
p137
aa(lp138
VDear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,
p139
aVand for the first time,
p140
aVbelieve me,
p141
aVI don't like newborn children, to be honest,
p142
aVbut when I went and I looked into her eyes,
p143
aVbelieve me,
p144
aVI got extremely honored.
p145
aVAnd long before she was born,
p146
aVI thought about her name,
p147
aVand I was fascinated with a heroic
p148
aVlegendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.
p149
aVHer name was Malalai of Maiwand,
p150
aVand I named my daughter after her.
p151
aVA few days after Malala was born,
p152
aVmy daughter was born,
p153
aVmy cousin came \u2014
p154
aVand it was a coincidence \u2014
p155
aVhe came to my home
p156
aVand he brought a family tree,
p157
aVa family tree of the Yousafzai family,
p158
aVand when I looked at the family tree,
p159
aVit traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.
p160
aVBut when I looked, all were men,
p161
aVand I picked my pen,
p162
aVdrew a line from my name,
p163
aVand wrote, "Malala."
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd when she grow old,
p166
aVwhen she was four and a half years old,
p167
aVI admitted her in my school.
p168
aVYou will be asking, then, why should I mention about
p169
aVthe admission of a girl in a school?
p170
aVYes, I must mention it.
p171
aVIt may be taken for granted in Canada,
p172
aVin America, in many developed countries,
p173
aVbut in poor countries,
p174
aVin patriarchal societies, in tribal societies,
p175
aVit's a big event for the life of girl.
p176
aVEnrollment in a school means
p177
aVrecognition of her identity and her name.
p178
aVAdmission in a school means
p179
aVthat she has entered the world of dreams
p180
aVand aspirations
p181
aVwhere she can explore her potentials
p182
aVfor her future life.
p183
aVI have five sisters,
p184
aVand none of them could go to school,
p185
aVand you will be astonished,
p186
aVtwo weeks before,
p187
aVwhen I was filling out the Canadian visa form,
p188
aVand I was filling out the family part of the form,
p189
aVI could not recall
p190
aVthe surnames of some of my sisters.
p191
aVAnd the reason was
p192
aVthat I have never, never seen the names
p193
aVof my sisters written on any document.
p194
aVThat was the reason that
p195
aVI valued my daughter.
p196
aVWhat my father could not give to my sisters
p197
aVand to his daughters,
p198
aVI thought I must change it.
p199
aa(lp200
VI used to appreciate the intelligence
p201
aVand the brilliance of my daughter.
p202
aVI encouraged her to sit with me
p203
aVwhen my friends used to come.
p204
aVI encouraged her to go with me to different meetings.
p205
aVAnd all these good values,
p206
aVI tried to inculcate in her personality.
p207
aVAnd this was not only she, only Malala.
p208
aVI imparted all these good values
p209
aVto my school, girl students  and boy students as well.
p210
aVI used education for emancipation.
p211
aVI taught my girls,
p212
aVI taught my girl students,
p213
aVto unlearn the lesson of obedience.
p214
aVI taught my boy students
p215
aVto unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.
p216
aa(lp217
VDear brothers and sisters,
p218
aVwe were striving for more rights for women,
p219
aVand we were struggling to have more,
p220
aVmore and more space for the women in society.
p221
aVBut we came across a new phenomenon.
p222
aVIt was lethal to human rights
p223
aVand particularly to women's rights.
p224
aVIt was called Talibanization.
p225
aVIt means a complete negation
p226
aVof women's participation
p227
aVin all political, economical and social activities.
p228
aVHundreds of schools were lost.
p229
aVGirls were prohibited from going to school.
p230
aVWomen were forced to wear veils
p231
aVand they were stopped from going to the markets.
p232
aVMusicians were silenced,
p233
aVgirls were flogged
p234
aVand singers were killed.
p235
aVMillions were suffering,
p236
aVbut few spoke,
p237
aVand it was the most scary thing
p238
aVwhen you have all around such people
p239
aVwho kill and who flog,
p240
aVand you speak for your rights.
p241
aVIt's really the most scary thing.
p242
aa(lp243
VAt the age of 10,
p244
aVMalala stood, and she stood for the right
p245
aVof education.
p246
aVShe wrote a diary for the BBC blog,
p247
aVshe volunteered herself
p248
aVfor the New York Times documentaries,
p249
aVand she spoke from every platform she could.
p250
aVAnd her voice was the most powerful voice.
p251
aVIt spread like a crescendo all around the world.
p252
aVAnd that was the reason the Taliban
p253
aVcould not tolerate her campaign,
p254
aVand on October 9 2012,
p255
aVshe was shot in the head at point blank range.
p256
aa(lp257
VIt was a doomsday for my family and for me.
p258
aVThe world turned into a big black hole.
p259
aVWhile my daughter was
p260
aVon the verge of life and death,
p261
aVI whispered into the ears of my wife,
p262
aV"Should I be blamed for what happened
p263
aVto my daughter and your daughter?"
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd she abruptly told me,
p266
aV"Please don't blame yourself.
p267
aVYou stood for the right cause.
p268
aVYou put your life at stake
p269
aVfor the cause of truth,
p270
aVfor the cause of peace,
p271
aVand for the cause of education,
p272
aVand your daughter in inspired from you
p273
aVand she joined you.
p274
aVYou both were on the right path
p275
aVand God will protect her."
p276
aa(lp277
VThese few words meant a lot to me,
p278
aVand I didn't ask this question again.
p279
aa(lp280
VWhen Malala was in the hospital,
p281
aVand she was going through the severe pains
p282
aVand she had had severe headaches
p283
aVbecause her facial nerve was cut down,
p284
aVI used to see a dark shadow
p285
aVspreading on the face of my wife.
p286
aVBut my daughter never complained.
p287
aVShe used to tell us,
p288
aV"I'm fine with my crooked smile
p289
aVand with my numbness in my face.
p290
aVI'll be okay. Please don't worry."
p291
aVShe was a solace for us,
p292
aVand she consoled us.
p293
aa(lp294
VDear brothers and sisters,
p295
aVwe learned from her how to be resilient
p296
aVin the most difficult times,
p297
aVand I'm glad to share with you
p298
aVthat despite being an icon
p299
aVfor the rights of children and women,
p300
aVshe is like any 16-year old girl.
p301
aVShe cries when her homework is incomplete.
p302
aVShe quarrels with her brothers,
p303
aVand I am very happy for that.
p304
aa(lp305
VPeople ask me,
p306
aVwhat special is in my mentorship
p307
aVwhich has made Malala so bold
p308
aVand so courageous and so vocal and poised?
p309
aVI tell them, don't ask me what I did.
p310
aVAsk me what I did not do.
p311
aVI did not clip her wings, and that's all.
p312
aa(lp313
VThank you very much.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Applause)
p316
aVThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)

VNow, I don't usually like cartoons,
p5
aVI don't think many of them are funny,
p6
aVI find them weird. But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Text: Never, ever think outside the box.) (Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VSo, the guy is telling the cat,
p11
aVdon't you dare think outside the box.
p12
aVWell, I'm afraid I used to be the cat.
p13
aVI always wanted to be outside the box.
p14
aVAnd it's partly because I came to this field
p15
aVfrom a different background, chemist and a bacterial geneticist.
p16
aVSo, what people were saying to me
p17
aVabout the cause of cancer, sources of cancer,
p18
aVor, for that matter, why you are who you are,
p19
aVdidn't make sense.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo, let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that
p22
aVand how I went about it.
p23
aVSo, to begin with, however,
p24
aVI have to give you a very, very quick lesson
p25
aVin developmental biology,
p26
aVwith apologies to those of you who know some biology.
p27
aVSo, when your mom and dad met,
p28
aVthere is a fertilized egg,
p29
aVthat round thing with that little blip.
p30
aVIt grows and then it grows,
p31
aVand then it makes this handsome man.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Applause)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, this guy, with all the cells in his body,
p36
aVall have the same genetic information.
p37
aVSo how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow,
p38
aVand why doesn't he get up one morning
p39
aVand have his nose turn into his foot?
p40
aVIt could. It has the genetic information.
p41
aVYou all remember, dolly,
p42
aVit came from a single mammary cell.
p43
aVSo, why doesn't it do it?
p44
aVSo, have a guess of how many cells he has in his body.
p45
aVSomewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body.
p46
aVTrillion!
p47
aVNow, how did these cells, all with the same genetic material,
p48
aVmake all those tissues?
p49
aVAnd so, the question I raised before
p50
aVbecomes even more interesting if you thought about
p51
aVthe enormity of this in every one of your bodies.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, the dominant cancer theory would say
p54
aVthat there is a single oncogene
p55
aVin a single cancer cell, and it would make you
p56
aVa cancer victim.
p57
aVWell, this did not make sense to me.
p58
aVDo you even know how a trillion looks?
p59
aVNow, let's look at it.
p60
aVThere it comes, these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes.
p61
aVNow, if .0001 of these cells got mutated,
p62
aVand .00001 got cancer, you will be a lump of cancer.
p63
aVYou will have cancer all over you. And you're not.
p64
aVWhy not?
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, I decided over the years,
p67
aVbecause of a series of experiments
p68
aVthat this is because of context and architecture.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd let me quickly tell you
p71
aVsome crucial experiment that was able to actually show this.
p72
aVTo begin with, I came to work with this virus
p73
aVthat causes that ugly tumor in the chicken.
p74
aVRous discovered this in 1911.
p75
aVIt was the first cancer virus discovered,
p76
aVand when I call it "oncogene," meaning "cancer gene."
p77
aVSo, he made a filtrate, he took this filter
p78
aVwhich was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter,
p79
aVand he injected it to another chicken, and he got another tumor.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, scientists were very excited,
p82
aVand they said, a single oncogene can do it.
p83
aVAll you need is a single oncogene.
p84
aVSo, they put the cells in cultures, chicken cells,
p85
aVdumped the virus on it,
p86
aVand it would pile up,
p87
aVand they would say, this is malignant and this is normal.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd again this didn't make sense to me.
p90
aVSo for various reasons, we took this oncogene,
p91
aVattached it to a blue marker,
p92
aVand we injected it into the embryos.
p93
aVNow look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo.
p94
aVEvery one of those blue cells are a cancer gene
p95
aVinside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather.
p96
aVSo, when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish,
p97
aVwe got a mass of blue cells.
p98
aVSo, in the chicken you get a tumor,
p99
aVin the embryo you don't,
p100
aVyou dissociate, you put it in a dish, you get another tumor.
p101
aVWhat does that mean?
p102
aVThat means that microenvironment
p103
aVand the context which surrounds those cells
p104
aVactually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow, let's take a normal example.
p107
aVThe normal example, let's take the human mammary gland.
p108
aVI work on breast cancer.
p109
aVSo, here is a lovely human breast.
p110
aVAnd many of you know how it looks,
p111
aVexcept that inside that breast, there are all these
p112
aVpretty, developing, tree-like structures.
p113
aVSo, we decided that what we like to do
p114
aVis take just a bit of that mammary gland,
p115
aVwhich is called an "acinus,"
p116
aVwhere there are all these little things inside the breast
p117
aVwhere the milk goes, and the end of the nipple
p118
aVcomes through that little tube when the baby sucks.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd we said, wonderful! Look at this pretty structure.
p121
aVWe want to make this a structure, and ask the question,
p122
aVhow do the cells do that?
p123
aVSo, we took the red cells \u2014
p124
aVyou see the red cells are surrounded by blue,
p125
aVother cells that squeeze them, and behind it
p126
aVis material that people thought was mainly inert,
p127
aVand it was just having a structure to keep the shape,
p128
aVand so we first photographed it
p129
aVwith the electron microscope years and years ago,
p130
aVand you see this cell is actually quite pretty.
p131
aVIt has a bottom, it has a top,
p132
aVit is secreting gobs and gobs of milk,
p133
aVbecause it just came from an early pregnant mouse.
p134
aa(lp135
VYou take these cells, you put them in a dish,
p136
aVand within three days, they look like that.
p137
aVThey completely forget.
p138
aVSo you take them out, you put them in a dish,
p139
aVthey don't make milk. They completely forget.
p140
aVFor example, here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk
p141
aVon the left, there is nothing on the right.
p142
aVLook at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left
p143
aVis in the animal, the one on the right is in a dish.
p144
aVThey are completely different from each other.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo, what does this tell you?
p147
aVThis tells you that here also, context overrides.
p148
aVIn different contexts, cells do different things.
p149
aVBut how does context signal?
p150
aVSo, Einstein said that
p151
aV"For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope."
p152
aVSo, you can imagine the amount of skepticism
p153
aVI received \u2014 couldn't get money,
p154
aVcouldn't do a whole lot of other things,
p155
aVbut I'm so glad it all worked out.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo, we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse,
p158
aVand all those lovely acini are there,
p159
aVevery one of those with the red around them are an acinus,
p160
aVand we said okay, we are going to try and make this,
p161
aVand I said, maybe that red stuff
p162
aVaround the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold,
p163
aVmaybe it has information,
p164
aVmaybe it tells the cells what to do, maybe it tells the nucleus what to do.
p165
aVSo I said, extracellular matrix, which is this stuff
p166
aVcalled ECM, signals and actually tells the cells what to do.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo, we decided to make things that would look like that.
p169
aVWe found some gooey material
p170
aVthat had the right extracellular matrix in it,
p171
aVwe put the cells in it, and lo and behold,
p172
aVin about four days, they got reorganized
p173
aVand on the right, is what we can make in culture.
p174
aVOn the left is what's inside the animal, we call it in vivo,
p175
aVand the one in culture was full of milk,
p176
aVthe lovely red there is full of milk.
p177
aVSo, we Got Milk, for the American audience.
p178
aVAll right. And here is this beautiful human cell,
p179
aVand you can imagine that here also, context goes.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo, what do we do now?
p182
aVI made a radical hypothesis.
p183
aVI said, if it's true that architecture is dominant,
p184
aVarchitecture restored to a cancer cell
p185
aVshould make the cancer cell think it's normal.
p186
aVCould this be done?
p187
aVSo, we tried it.
p188
aVIn order to do that, however,
p189
aVwe needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant,
p190
aVand on the left is the single normal cell,
p191
aVhuman breast, put in three-dimensional gooey gel
p192
aVthat has extracellular matrix, it makes all these beautiful structures.
p193
aVOn the right, you see it looks very ugly,
p194
aVthe cells continue to grow,
p195
aVthe normal ones stop.
p196
aVAnd you see here in higher magnification
p197
aVthe normal acinus and the ugly tumor.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo we said, what is on the surface of these ugly tumors?
p200
aVCould we calm them down \u2014
p201
aVthey were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up \u2014
p202
aVand make them to the level of the normal?
p203
aVWell, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind.
p204
aVThis is what we got.
p205
aVWe can revert the malignant phenotype.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd in order to show you that the malignant phenotype
p210
aVI didn't just choose one,
p211
aVhere are little movies, sort of fuzzy,
p212
aVbut you see that on the left are the malignant cells,
p213
aVall of them are malignant,
p214
aVwe add one single inhibitor in the beginning,
p215
aVand look what happens, they all look like that.
p216
aVWe inject them into the mouse, the ones on the right,
p217
aVand none of them would make tumors.
p218
aVWe inject the other ones in the mouse, 100 percent tumors.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo, it's a new way of thinking about cancer,
p221
aVit's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer.
p222
aVWe should be able to be dealing with these things at this level,
p223
aVand these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior
p224
aVis regulated at the level of tissue organization
p225
aVand that the tissue organization is dependent
p226
aVon the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment.
p227
aVAll right, thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally.
p228
aVAnd here is another five seconds of repose,
p229
aVis my mantra. Form and function.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd of course, we now ask, where do we go now?
p232
aVWe'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic.
p233
aVBut before we do that, I'd like you to think
p234
aVthat at any given time when you're sitting there,
p235
aVin your 70 trillion cells,
p236
aVthe extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus,
p237
aVthe nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix
p238
aVand this is how your balance is kept and restored.
p239
aa(lp240
VWe have made a lot of discoveries,
p241
aVwe have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin.
p242
aVWe have shown that there's little pieces of DNA
p243
aVon the specific genes of the mammary gland
p244
aVthat actually respond to extracellular matrix.
p245
aVIt has taken many years, but it has been very rewarding.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd before I get to the next slide, I have to tell you
p248
aVthat there are so many additional discoveries to be made.
p249
aVThere is so much mystery we don't know.
p250
aVAnd I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to,
p251
aVdon't be arrogant, because arrogance kills curiosity.
p252
aVCuriosity and passion.
p253
aVYou need to always think, what else needs to be discovered?
p254
aVAnd maybe my discovery needs to be added to
p255
aVor maybe it needs to be changed.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo, we have now made an amazing discovery,
p258
aVa post-doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me,
p259
aVwhat do the cells do when you put them in?
p260
aVWhat do they do in the beginning when they do?
p261
aVI said, I don't know, we couldn't look at them.
p262
aVWe didn't have high images in the old days.
p263
aVSo she, being an imager and a physicist,
p264
aVdid this incredible thing.
p265
aVThis is a single human breast cell in three dimensions.
p266
aVLook at it. It's constantly doing this.
p267
aVHas a coherent movement.
p268
aVYou put the cancer cells there, and they do go all over,
p269
aVthey do this. They don't do this.
p270
aVAnd when we revert the cancer cell, it again does this.
p271
aVAbsolutely boggles my mind.
p272
aVSo the cell acts like an embryo. What an exciting thing.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo I'd like to finish with a poem.
p275
aVWell I used to love English literature,
p276
aVand I debated in college, which one should I do?
p277
aVAnd unfortunately or fortunately, chemistry won.
p278
aVBut here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines.
p279
aVIt's called "Among the School Children."
p280
aV"O body swayed to music / O brightening glance /
p281
aVHow [can we know] the dancer from the dance?"
p282
aVAnd here is Merce Cunningham,
p283
aVI was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger,
p284
aVand here he is a dancer,
p285
aVand while he is dancing, he is both the dancer and the dance.
p286
aVThe minute he stops, we have neither.
p287
aVSo it's like form and function.
p288
aa(lp289
VNow, I'd like to show you a current picture of my group.
p290
aVI have been fortunate to have had these magnificant
p291
aVstudents and post-docs who have taught me so much,
p292
aVand I have had many of these groups come and go.
p293
aVThey are the future and I try to make them not be afraid
p294
aVof being the cat and being told,
p295
aVdon't think outside the box.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd I'd like to leave you with this thought.
p298
aVOn the left is water coming through the shore,
p299
aVtaken from a NASA satellite.
p300
aVOn the right, there is a coral.
p301
aVNow if you take the mammary gland and spread it
p302
aVand take the fat away, on a dish it looks like that.
p303
aVDo they look the same? Do they have the same patterns?
p304
aVWhy is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again?
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd I'd like to submit to you
p307
aVthat we have sequenced the human genome,
p308
aVwe know everything about the sequence of the gene,
p309
aVthe language of the gene, the alphabet of the gene,
p310
aVBut we know nothing, but nothing,
p311
aVabout the language and alphabet of form.
p312
aVSo, it's a wonderful new horizon,
p313
aVit's a wonderful thing to discover for the young
p314
aVand the passionate old, and that's me.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo go to it!
p317

groundbreaking research has proven that cancer is not only caused by cancer cells. It is caused by an interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding cellular micro-environment. In healthy bodies, normal tissue homeostasis and architecture inhibit the progression of cancers. But changes in the microenvironment--following an injury or a wound for instance--can shift the balance. This explains why many people harbor potentially malignant tumors in their bodies without knowing it and never develop cancer, and why tumors often develop when tissue is damaged or when the immune system is suppressed.</p>  <p>The converse can also be true. In a landmark 1997 experiment, mutated mammary cells, when dosed with an antibody and placed into a normal cellular micro-environment, behaved normally. This powerful insight from Bissell&#39;s lab may lead to new ways of treating existing and preventing potential cancers.</p>", "slug": "mina_bissell", "whotheyare": "Mina Bissell studies how cancer interacts with our bodies, searching for clues to how cancer\'s microenvironment influences its growth.", "whatotherssay": "Bissell was not the first to claim that a cell\'s microenvironment plays a role in the formation of tumors.

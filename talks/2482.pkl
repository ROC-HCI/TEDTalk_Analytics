VI'm turning 44 next month,
p5
aVand I have the sense that 44 is going to be a very good year,
p6
aVa year of fulfillment, realization.
p7
aVI have that sense,
p8
aVnot because of anything particular in store for me,
p9
aVbut because I read it would be a good year
p10
aVin a 1968 book by Norman Mailer.
p11
aa(lp12
V"He felt his own age, forty-four ..."
p13
aVwrote Mailer in "The Armies of the Night,"
p14
aV"... felt as if he were a solid embodiment
p15
aVof bone, muscle, heart, mind, and sentiment to be a man,
p16
aVas if he had arrived."
p17
aa(lp18
VYes, I know Mailer wasn't writing about me.
p19
aVBut I also know that he was;
p20
aVfor all of us \u2014 you, me, the subject of his book,
p21
aVage more or less in step,
p22
aVproceed from birth along the same great sequence:
p23
aVthrough the wonders and confinements of childhood;
p24
aVthe emancipations and frustrations of adolescence;
p25
aVthe empowerments and millstones of adulthood;
p26
aVthe recognitions and resignations of old age.
p27
aVThere are patterns to life,
p28
aVand they are shared.
p29
aVAs Thomas Mann wrote: "It will happen to me as to them."
p30
aa(lp31
VWe don't simply live these patterns.
p32
aVWe record them, too.
p33
aVWe write them down in books, where they become narratives
p34
aVthat we can then read and recognize.
p35
aVBooks tell us who we've been,
p36
aVwho we are, who we will be, too.
p37
aVSo they have for millennia.
p38
aVAs James Salter wrote,
p39
aV"Life passes into pages if it passes into anything."
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd so six years ago, a thought leapt to mind:
p42
aVif life passed into pages, there were, somewhere,
p43
aVpassages written about every age.
p44
aVIf I could find them, I could assemble them into a narrative.
p45
aVI could assemble them into a life,
p46
aVa long life, a hundred-year life,
p47
aVthe entirety of that same great sequence
p48
aVthrough which the luckiest among us pass.
p49
aVI was then 37 years old,
p50
aV"an age of discretion," wrote William Trevor.
p51
aVI was prone to meditating on time and age.
p52
aVAn illness in the family and later an injury to me
p53
aVhad long made clear that growing old could not be assumed.
p54
aVAnd besides, growing old only postponed the inevitable,
p55
aVtime seeing through what circumstance did not.
p56
aVIt was all a bit disheartening.
p57
aa(lp58
VA list, though, would last.
p59
aVTo chronicle a life year by vulnerable year
p60
aVwould be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting,
p61
aVwould be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future,
p62
aVwhether we made it there or not.
p63
aVAnd when I then began to compile my list, I was quickly obsessed,
p64
aVsearching pages and pages for ages and ages.
p65
aVHere we were at every annual step through our first hundred years.
p66
aV"Twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations,"
p67
aV"sixty-two, ... of subtle diminishments."
p68
aa(lp69
VI was mindful, of course, that such insights were relative.
p70
aVFor starters, we now live longer, and so age more slowly.
p71
aVChristopher Isherwood used the phrase "the yellow leaf"
p72
aVto describe a man at 53,
p73
aVonly one century after Lord Byron used it to describe himself at 36.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VI was mindful, too, that life can swing wildly and unpredictably
p78
aVfrom one year to the next,
p79
aVand that people may experience the same age differently.
p80
aVBut even so, as the list coalesced,
p81
aVso, too, on the page, clear as the reflection in the mirror,
p82
aVdid the life that I had been living:
p83
aVfinding at 20 that "... one is less and less sure of who one is;"
p84
aVemerging at 30 from the "... wasteland of preparation into active life;"
p85
aVlearning at 40 "... to close softly the doors to rooms
p86
aV[I would] not be coming back to."
p87
aVThere I was.
p88
aa(lp89
VOf course, there we all are.
p90
aVMilton Glaser, the great graphic designer
p91
aVwhose beautiful visualizations you see here,
p92
aVand who today is 85 \u2014
p93
aVall those years "... a ripening and an apotheosis," wrote Nabokov \u2014
p94
aVnoted to me that, like art and like color,
p95
aVliterature helps us to remember what we've experienced.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd indeed, when I shared the list with my grandfather,
p98
aVhe nodded in recognition.
p99
aVHe was then 95 and soon to die,
p100
aVwhich, wrote Roberto Bolaño,
p101
aV"... is the same as never dying."
p102
aVAnd looking back, he said to me that, yes,
p103
aVProust was right that at 22, we are sure we will not die,
p104
aVjust as a thanatologist named Edwin Shneidman was right
p105
aVthat at 90, we are sure we will.
p106
aVIt had happened to him,
p107
aVas to them.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow the list is done:
p110
aVa hundred years.
p111
aVAnd looking back over it,
p112
aVI know that I am not done.
p113
aVI still have my life to live,
p114
aVstill have many more pages to pass into.
p115
aVAnd mindful of Mailer,
p116
aVI await 44.
p117
aa(lp118
VThank you.

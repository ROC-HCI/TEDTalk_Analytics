VWell, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said
p5
aVon his first successful telephone call,
p6
aV"Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?"
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVI just really want to thank you very much.
p9
aVAs another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said,
p10
aV"What a strange, long trip."
p11
aVAnd he should have said,
p12
aV"What a strange, long trip it's about to become."
p13
aVAt this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.
p14
aVMy lower half is appearing at a different conference
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVin a different country.
p17
aVYou can, it turns out, be in two places at once.
p18
aVBut still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person.
p19
aVI'll explain at another time.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd though I'm a rock star,
p22
aVI just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.
p23
aVBut what really turns me on about technology
p24
aVis not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players.
p25
aVThe revolution \u2014 this revolution \u2014 is much bigger than that.
p26
aVI hope, I believe.
p27
aVWhat turns me on about the digital age,
p28
aVwhat excites me personally,
p29
aVis that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.
p30
aVYou see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song,
p31
aVyou needed a studio and a producer.
p32
aVNow, you need a laptop.
p33
aVIf you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipment
p34
aVand a Hollywood budget.
p35
aVNow, you need a camera that fits in your palm,
p36
aVand a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.
p37
aVImagination has been decoupled from the old constraints.
p38
aVAnd that really, really excites me.
p39
aVI'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.
p40
aa(lp41
VWhat I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.
p42
aVPolitical, economic, psychological, whatever.
p43
aVThe geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.
p44
aVFrom the ease with which you swept away obstacles
p45
aVthat no one knew could even be budged.
p46
aVAnd that's actually what I'd like to talk about today.
p47
aVFirst, though, I should probably explain why, and how,
p48
aVI got to this place.
p49
aVIt's a journey that started 20 years ago.
p50
aVYou may remember that song, "We Are the World,"
p51
aVor, "Do They Know It's Christmas?"
p52
aVBand Aid, Live Aid.
p53
aVAnother very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof,
p54
aVissued a challenge to "feed the world."
p55
aVIt was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.
p56
aVThat summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia.
p57
aVWe went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.
p58
aVWe lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.
p59
aVThe children had a name for me.
p60
aVThey called me, "The girl with the beard."
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VDon't ask.
p65
aVAnyway, we found Africa to be a magical place.
p66
aVBig skies, big hearts, big, shining continent.
p67
aVBeautiful, royal people.
p68
aVAnybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.
p69
aVEthiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind.
p70
aVAnyway, on our last day at this orphanage
p71
aVa man handed me his baby and said,
p72
aV"Would you take my son with you?"
p73
aVHe knew, in Ireland, that his son would live,
p74
aVand that in Ethiopia, his son would die.
p75
aVIt was the middle of that awful famine.
p76
aVWell, I turned him down.
p77
aVAnd it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down.
p78
aVAnd it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget.
p79
aVAnd in that moment, I started this journey.
p80
aa(lp81
VIn that moment, I became the worst thing of all:
p82
aVI became a rock star with a cause. (Laughter)
p83
aVExcept this isn't the cause, is it?
p84
aVSix-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS \u2014
p85
aVa preventable, treatable disease \u2014
p86
aVfor lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy.
p87
aVThat's not a cause. That's an emergency.
p88
aV11 million AIDS orphans in Africa,
p89
aV20 million by the end of the decade.
p90
aVThat's not a cause. That's an emergency.
p91
aVToday, every day, 9,000 more Africans
p92
aVwill catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.
p93
aVThat's not a cause. That's an emergency.
p94
aVSo what we're talking about here is human rights.
p95
aVThe right to live like a human.
p96
aVThe right to live, period.
p97
aVAnd what we're facing in Africa is
p98
aVan unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is,
p101
aVand what this problem isn't.
p102
aVBecause this is not all about charity.
p103
aVThis is about justice. Really.
p104
aVThis is not about charity. This is about justice.
p105
aVThat's right.
p106
aVAnd that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.
p107
aVAmericans, like Irish people, are good at it.
p108
aVEven the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford.
p109
aVWe like to give, and we give a lot.
p110
aVLook at the response to the tsunami \u2014 it's inspiring.
p111
aVBut justice is a tougher standard than charity.
p112
aVYou see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice.
p113
aVIt makes a farce of our idea of equality.
p114
aVIt mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern.
p115
aVIt questions our commitment.
p116
aVBecause there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa,
p117
aVand if we're honest,
p118
aVconclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.
p119
aa(lp120
VAs you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here.
p121
aVNot here, not in America, not in Europe.
p122
aVIn fact, a head of state that you're all familiar with
p123
aVadmitted this to me. And it's really true.
p124
aVThere is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life
p125
aVwould be accepted anywhere else other than Africa.
p126
aVAfrica is a continent in flames.
p127
aVAnd deep down, if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us,
p128
aVwe would all do more to put the fire out.
p129
aVWe're standing around with watering cans,
p130
aVwhen what we really need is the fire brigade.
p131
aa(lp132
VYou see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami.
p133
aVIt's crazy, really, when you think about it.
p134
aVDoes stuff have to look like an action movie these days
p135
aVto exist in the front of our brain?
p136
aVThe slow extinguishing of countless lives
p137
aVis just not dramatic enough, it would appear.
p138
aVCatastrophes that we can avert
p139
aVare not as interesting as ones we could avert.
p140
aVFunny, that.
p141
aVAnyway, I believe that that kind of thinking
p142
aVoffends the intellectual rigor in this room.
p143
aVSix-and-a-half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis,
p144
aVbut the fact that it's not on the nightly news,
p145
aVthat we in Europe, or you in America,
p146
aVare not treating it like an emergency \u2014
p147
aVI want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis.
p148
aVI want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror,
p149
aVit could be soon.
p150
aVEvery week, religious extremists take another African village.
p151
aVThey're attempting to bring order to chaos.
p152
aVWell, why aren't we?
p153
aa(lp154
VPoverty breeds despair. We know this.
p155
aVDespair breeds violence. We know this.
p156
aVIn turbulent times, isn't it cheaper, and smarter,
p157
aVto make friends out of potential enemies
p158
aVthan to defend yourself against them later?
p159
aV"The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."
p160
aVAnd I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that.
p161
aVNow when the military are telling us that this is a war
p162
aVthat cannot be won by military might alone,
p163
aVmaybe we should listen.
p164
aVThere's an opportunity here, and it's real.
p165
aVIt's not spin. It's not wishful thinking.
p166
aVThe problems facing the developing world
p167
aVafford us in the developed world
p168
aVa chance to re-describe ourselves to the world.
p169
aVWe will not only transform other people's lives,
p170
aVbut we will also transform the way those other lives see us.
p171
aVAnd that might be smart in these nervous, dangerous times.
p172
aa(lp173
VDon't you think that on a purely commercial level,
p174
aVthat anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements
p175
aVfor Western ingenuity and technology?
p176
aVDoesn't compassion look well on us?
p177
aVAnd let's cut the crap for a second.
p178
aVIn certain quarters of the world, brand EU, brand USA,
p179
aVis not at its shiniest.
p180
aVThe neon sign is fizzing and cracking.
p181
aVSomeone's put a brick through the window.
p182
aVThe regional branch managers are getting nervous.
p183
aVNever before have we in the west been so scrutinized.
p184
aVOur values: do we have any?
p185
aVOur credibility?
p186
aVThese things are under attack around the world.
p187
aVBrand USA could use some polishing.
p188
aVAnd I say that as a fan, you know?
p189
aVAs a person who buys the products.
p190
aVBut think about it.
p191
aVMore anti-retrovirals make sense.
p192
aVBut that's just the easy part, or ought to be.
p193
aa(lp194
VBut equality for Africa \u2014
p195
aVthat's a big, expensive idea.
p196
aVYou see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.
p197
aVWhat on earth can we all do about this?
p198
aVWell, much more than we think.
p199
aVWe can't fix every problem, but the ones we can,
p200
aVI want to argue, we must.
p201
aVAnd because we can, we must.
p202
aVThis is the straight truth, the righteous truth.
p203
aVIt is not a theory.
p204
aVThe fact is that ours is the first generation
p205
aVthat can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye,
p206
aVlook across the ocean to Africa, and say this, and mean it:
p207
aVwe do not have to stand for this.
p208
aVA whole continent written off \u2014 we do not have to stand for this.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Applause)
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd let me say this without a trace of irony \u2014
p213
aVbefore I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.
p214
aVForget the '60s. We can change the world.
p215
aVI can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world.
p216
aVI really believe that, the people in this room.
p217
aVLook at the Gates Foundation.
p218
aVThey've done incredible stuff, unbelievable stuff.
p219
aVBut working together, we can actually change the world.
p220
aVWe can turn the inevitable outcomes,
p221
aVand transform the quality of life for millions of lives
p222
aVwho look and feel rather like us, when you're up close.
p223
aVI'm sorry to laugh here, but you do look so different
p224
aVthan you did in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VBut I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.
p229
aVIt is the flowering of the seeds you planted
p230
aVin earlier, headier days.
p231
aVIdeas that you gestated in your youth.
p232
aVThis is what excites me.
p233
aVThis room was born for this moment,
p234
aVis really what I want to say to you tonight.
p235
aVMost of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you?
p236
aVMost of you did, the digital world.
p237
aVWell, now, actually because of you,
p238
aVit is possible to change the physical world.
p239
aVIt's a fact.
p240
aVEconomists confirm it, and they know much more than I do.
p241
aVSo why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?
p242
aVProbably because when we admit we can do something about it,
p243
aVwe've got to do something about it.
p244
aVIt is a pain in the arse.
p245
aVThis equality business is actually a pain in the arse.
p246
aVBut for the first time in history, we have the technology;
p247
aVwe have the know-how; we have the cash;
p248
aVwe have the life-saving drugs.
p249
aa(lp250
VDo we have the will?
p251
aVI hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie.
p252
aVAnd I'm not really one for the warm, fuzzy feeling.
p253
aVI do not have flowers in my hair.
p254
aVActually, I come from punk rock.
p255
aVThe Clash wore big army boots, not sandals.
p256
aVBut I know toughness when I see it.
p257
aVAnd for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast,
p258
aVthere was muscle to the movement that started out here.
p259
aVYou see, idealism detached from action is just a dream.
p260
aVBut idealism allied with pragmatism,
p261
aVwith rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit,
p262
aVis very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong.
p263
aVAnd it's very present in a crowd like you.
p264
aa(lp265
VLast year at DATA, this organization I helped set up,
p266
aVwe launched a campaign to summon this spirit
p267
aVin the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty.
p268
aVWe're calling it the ONE Campaign.
p269
aVIt's based on our belief that the action of one person
p270
aVcan change a lot,
p271
aVbut the actions of many coming together as one
p272
aVcan change the world.
p273
aVWell, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right.
p274
aVThere are moments in history when civilization redefines itself.
p275
aVWe believe this is one.
p276
aVWe believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides
p277
aVthat the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable.
p278
aVThis could be the time that we finally get serious
p279
aVabout changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth.
p280
aa(lp281
VMomentum has been building.
p282
aVLurching a little, but it's building.
p283
aVThis year is a test for us all,
p284
aVespecially the leaders of the G8 nations,
p285
aVwho really are on the line here,
p286
aVwith all the world in history watching.
p287
aVI have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration.
p288
aVThey started out with such promise on Africa.
p289
aVThey made some really great promises,
p290
aVand actually have fulfilled a lot of them.
p291
aVBut some of them they haven't.
p292
aVThey don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth.
p293
aVBut my disappointment has much more perspective
p294
aVwhen I talk to American people,
p295
aVand I hear their worries about the deficit,
p296
aVand the fiscal well being of their country.
p297
aVI understand that.
p298
aVBut there's much more push from the ground than you'd think,
p299
aVif we got organized.
p300
aa(lp301
VWhat I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree,
p302
aVis that aid for Africa is just great value for money
p303
aVat a time when America really needs it.
p304
aVPutting it in the crassest possible terms,
p305
aVthe investment reaps huge returns.
p306
aVNot only in lives saved, but in goodwill, stability
p307
aVand security that we'll gain.
p308
aVSo this is what I hope that you will do, if I could be so bold,
p309
aVand not have it deducted from my number of wishes.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VWhat I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts,
p314
aVthat you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa,
p315
aVby America and by the world.
p316
aVGive them permission, if you like,
p317
aVto spend their political capital and your financial capital,
p318
aVyour national purse on saving the lives of millions of people.
p319
aVThat's really what I would like you to do.
p320
aVBecause we also need your intellectual capital:
p321
aVyour ideas, your skills, your ingenuity.
p322
aVAnd you, at this conference, are in a unique position.
p323
aVSome of the technologies we've been talking about, you invented them,
p324
aVor at least revolutionized the way that they're used.
p325
aVTogether you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital,
p326
aVand pushed the boundaries.
p327
aVAnd we'd like you to give us that energy.
p328
aVGive us that kind of dreaming, that kind of doing.
p329
aa(lp330
VAs I say, there're two things on the line here.
p331
aVThere's the continent Africa.
p332
aVBut there's also our sense of ourselves.
p333
aVPeople are starting to figure this out.
p334
aVMovements are springing up.
p335
aVArtists, politicians, pop stars, priests, CEOs,
p336
aVNGOs, mothers' unions, student unions.
p337
aVA lot of people are getting together, and working
p338
aVunder this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign.
p339
aVI think they just have one idea in their mind,
p340
aVwhich is, where you live in the world
p341
aVshould not determine whether you live in the world.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VHistory, like God, is watching what we do.
p346
aVWhen the history books get written,
p347
aVI think our age will be remembered for three things.
p348
aVReally, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for.
p349
aVThe digital revolution, yes.
p350
aVThe war against terror, yes.
p351
aVAnd what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.
p352
aVSome say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to.
p353
aVThank you, thank you very much.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Applause)
p356
aa(lp357
VOkay, my three wishes.
p358
aVThe ones that TED has offered to grant.
p359
aVYou see, if this is true, and I believe it is,
p360
aVthat the digital world you all created has uncoupled
p361
aVthe creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter,
p362
aVthis should be a piece of piss.
p363
aa(lp364
V(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
VI should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.
p367
aVMost of them impossible, some of them impractical
p368
aVand one or two of them certainly immoral.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Laughter)
p371
aa(lp372
VThis business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean,
p373
aVwhen somebody else is picking up the tab.
p374
aVAnyway, here's number one.
p375
aVI wish for you to help build a social movement
p376
aVof more than one million American activists for Africa.
p377
aVThat is my first wish.
p378
aVI believe it's possible.
p379
aVA few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up.
p380
aVYou know, there's lots out there.
p381
aVAnd with this one campaign as our umbrella,
p382
aVmy organization, DATA, and other groups,
p383
aVhave been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm
p384
aVthat's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America.
p385
aVWe know there's more than enough energy to power this movement.
p386
aVWe just need your help in making it happen.
p387
aa(lp388
VWe want all of you here, church America, corporate America,
p389
aVMicrosoft America, Apple America, Coke America,
p390
aVPepsi America, nerd America, noisy America.
p391
aVWe can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.
p392
aVI do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong,
p393
aVwe're not going to be denied.
p394
aVWe will have the ear of Congress.
p395
aVWe'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book,
p396
aVand right into the Oval Office.
p397
aVIf there's one million Americans \u2014 and I really know this \u2014
p398
aVwho are ready to make phone calls,
p399
aVwho are ready to be on email,
p400
aVI am absolutely sure that we can actually change
p401
aVthe course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.
p402
aVAnyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.
p403
aVI know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this,
p404
aVbut there's lots of you we'd like to talk to.
p405
aa(lp406
VRight, my second wish, number two.
p407
aVI would like one media hit for every person on the planet
p408
aVwho is living on less than one dollar a day.
p409
aVThat's one billion media hits.
p410
aVCould be on Google, could be on AOL.
p411
aVSteve Case, Larry, Sergey \u2014 they've done a lot already.
p412
aVIt could be NBC. It could be ABC.
p413
aVActually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars.
p414
aVWe have a film, produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media.
p415
aVBut you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas.
p416
aVWe need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people.
p417
aVI really believe that old Truman line,
p418
aVthat if you give the American people the facts,
p419
aVthey'll do the right thing.
p420
aVAnd, the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers.
p421
aVThis has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.
p422
aa(lp423
V(Video): One by one they step forward,
p424
aVa nurse, a teacher, a homemaker,
p425
aVand lives are saved.
p426
aVThe problem is enormous.
p427
aVEvery three seconds one person dies.
p428
aVAnother three seconds, one more.
p429
aVThe situation is so desperate in parts of Africa,
p430
aVAsia, even America,
p431
aVthat aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami,

aVare uniting as one, acting as one.
p433
aVWe can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS.
p434
aVBut we need your help.
p435
aVOne more person, letter, voice
p436
aVwill mean the difference between life and death
p437
aVfor millions of people.
p438
aVPlease join us by working together.
p439
aVAmericans have an unprecedented opportunity.
p440
aVWe can make history.
p441
aVWe can start to make poverty history.
p442
aVOne, by one, by one.
p443
aVPlease visit ONE at this address.
p444
aVWe're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.

VBono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information,
p447
aVits power to rewrite the rules and transform lives,
p448
aVby connecting every hospital, health clinic and school
p449
aVin one African country.
p450
aVAnd I would like it to be Ethiopia.
p451
aVI believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia,
p452
aVevery health clinic, every hospital \u2014
p453
aVwe can connect to the Internet.
p454
aVThat is my wish, my third wish.
p455
aVI think it's possible.
p456
aVI think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.
p457
aVAnd that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true.
p458
aVI've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier.
p459
aVIt's actually where it all started for me.
p460
aVThe idea that the Internet, which changed all of our lives,
p461
aVcan transform a country \u2014 and a continent
p462
aVthat has hardly made it to analog, let alone digital \u2014 blows my mind.
p463
aVBut it didn't start out that way.
p464
aa(lp465
VThe first long-distance line from Boston to New York
p466
aVwas used in 1885 on the phone.
p467
aVIt was just nine years later that Addis Ababa
p468
aVwas connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away.
p469
aVSince then, not that much has changed.
p470
aVThe average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia
p471
aVis actually about seven or eight years.
p472
aVBut wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then.
p473
aVAnyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see,
p474
aVI know how important talking is.
p475
aVCommunication is very important for Ethiopia \u2014 will transform the country.
p476
aVNurses getting better training,
p477
aVpharmacists being able to order supplies,
p478
aVdoctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine.
p479
aVIt's a very, very good idea to get them wired.
p480
aVAnd that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference.
p481
aVThank you very much once again.

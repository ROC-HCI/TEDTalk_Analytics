VElection night 2008
p5
aVwas a night that tore me in half.
p6
aVIt was the night that Barack Obama was elected.
p7
aV[One hundred and forty-three]  years after the end of slavery,
p8
aVand [43] years after the passage
p9
aVof the Voting Rights Act,
p10
aVan African-American was elected president.
p11
aVMany of us never thought that this was possible
p12
aVuntil the moment that it happened.
p13
aVAnd in many ways, it was the climax
p14
aVof the black civil rights movement
p15
aVin the United States.
p16
aa(lp17
VI was in California that night,
p18
aVwhich was ground zero at the time
p19
aVfor another movement:
p20
aVthe marriage equality movement.
p21
aVGay marriage was on the ballot
p22
aVin the form of Proposition 8,
p23
aVand as the election returns started to come in,
p24
aVit became clear that the right
p25
aVfor same sex couples to marry,
p26
aVwhich had recently been granted by the California courts,
p27
aVwas going to be taken away.
p28
aVSo on the same night
p29
aVthat Barack Obama won his historic presidency,
p30
aVthe lesbian and gay community suffered
p31
aVone of our most painful defeats.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd then it got even worse.
p34
aVPretty much immediately,
p35
aVAfrican-Americans started to be blamed
p36
aVfor the passage of Proposition 8.
p37
aVThis was largely due to an incorrect poll that said
p38
aVthat blacks had voted for the measure
p39
aVby something like 70 percent.
p40
aVThis turned out not to be true,
p41
aVbut this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in,
p42
aVand was grabbed on by the media.
p43
aVI couldn't tear myself away from the coverage.
p44
aVI listened to some gay commentator say
p45
aVthat the African-American community
p46
aVwas notoriously homophobic,
p47
aVand now that civil rights had been achieved for us,
p48
aVwe wanted to take away other people's rights.
p49
aVThere were even reports of racist epithets
p50
aVbeing thrown at some of the participants
p51
aVof the gay rights rallies
p52
aVthat took place after the election.
p53
aVAnd on the other side,
p54
aVsome African-Americans dismissed or ignored
p55
aVhomophobia that was indeed real in our community.
p56
aVAnd others resented this comparison
p57
aVbetween gay rights and civil rights,
p58
aVand once again, the sinking feeling
p59
aVthat two minority groups
p60
aVof which I'm both a part of
p61
aVwere competing with each other
p62
aVinstead of supporting each other
p63
aVoverwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, I'm a documentary filmmaker,
p66
aVso after going through my pissed off stage
p67
aVand yelling at the television and radio,
p68
aVmy next instinct was
p69
aVto make a movie.
p70
aVAnd what guided me in making this film was,
p71
aVhow was this happening?
p72
aVHow was it that the gay rights movement
p73
aVwas being pitted against the civil rights movement?
p74
aVAnd this wasn't just an abstract question.
p75
aVI'm a beneficiary of both movements,
p76
aVso this was actually personal.
p77
aVBut then something else happened
p78
aVafter that election in 2008.
p79
aVThe march towards gay equality
p80
aVaccelerated at a pace
p81
aVthat surprised and shocked everyone,
p82
aVand is still reshaping our laws and our policies,
p83
aVour institutions and our entire country.
p84
aVAnd so it started to become increasingly clear to me
p85
aVthat this pitting of the two movements
p86
aVagainst each other actually didn't make sense,
p87
aVand that they were in fact
p88
aVmuch, much more interconnected,
p89
aVand that, in fact, some of the way
p90
aVthat the gay rights movement has been able
p91
aVto make such incredible gains so quickly
p92
aVis that it's used some of the same tactics
p93
aVand strategies that were first laid down
p94
aVby the civil rights movement.
p95
aVLet's just look at a few of these strategies.
p96
aa(lp97
VFirst off, it's really interesting to see,
p98
aVto actually visually see, how quick
p99
aVthe gay rights movement has made its gains,
p100
aVif you look at a few of the major events
p101
aVon a timeline of both freedom movements.
p102
aVNow, there are tons of milestones
p103
aVin the civil rights movement,
p104
aVbut the first one we're going to start with
p105
aVis the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.
p106
aVThis was a protest campaign
p107
aVagainst Montgomery, Alabama's segregation
p108
aVon their public transit system,
p109
aVand it began when a woman named Rosa Parks
p110
aVrefused to give up her seat to a white person.
p111
aVThe campaign lasted a year,
p112
aVand it galvanized the civil rights movement
p113
aVlike nothing had before it.
p114
aVAnd I call this strategy the
p115
aV"I'm tired of your foot on my neck" strategy.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo gays and lesbians have been in society
p118
aVsince societies began,
p119
aVbut up until the mid-20th century,
p120
aVhomosexual acts were still illegal in most states.
p121
aVSo just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott,
p122
aVa group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.
p123
aVIt's known as Stonewall, in 1969,
p124
aVand it's where a group of LGBT patrons
p125
aVfought back against police beatings
p126
aVat a Greenwich Village bar that sparked
p127
aVthree days of rioting.
p128
aVIncidentally, black and latino LGBT folks
p129
aVwere at the forefront of this rebellion,
p130
aVand it's a really interesting example
p131
aVof the intersection of our struggles against racism,
p132
aVhomophobia, gender identity and police brutality.
p133
aVAfter Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups
p134
aVsprang up all over the country,
p135
aVand the modern gay rights  movement as we know it took off.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo the next moment to look at on the timeline
p138
aVis the 1963 March on Washington.
p139
aVThis was a seminal event in the civil rights movement
p140
aVand it's where African-Americans called for both
p141
aVcivil and economic justice.
p142
aVAnd it's of course where Martin Luther King
p143
aVdelivered his famous "I have a dream" speech,
p144
aVbut what's actually less known
p145
aVis that this march was organized
p146
aVby a man named Bayard Rustin.
p147
aVBayard was an out gay man,
p148
aVand he's considered one of the most brilliant
p149
aVstrategists of the civil rights movement.
p150
aVHe later in his life became a fierce advocate
p151
aVof LGBT rights as well, and his life
p152
aVis testament to the intersection of the struggles.
p153
aVThe March on Washington
p154
aVis one of the high points of the movement,
p155
aVand it's where there was a fervent belief
p156
aVthat African-Americans too
p157
aVcould be a part of American democracy.
p158
aVI call this strategy the
p159
aV"We are visible and many in numbers" strategy.
p160
aa(lp161
VSome early gay activists were actually
p162
aVdirectly inspired by the march,
p163
aVand some had taken part.
p164
aVGay pioneer Jack Nichols said,
p165
aV"We marched with Martin Luther King,
p166
aVseven of us from the Mattachine Society" \u2014
p167
aVwhich was an early gay rights organization \u2014
p168
aV"and from that moment on, we had our own dream
p169
aVabout a gay rights march of similar proportions."
p170
aVSeveral years later, a series of marches took place,
p171
aVeach one gaining the momentum
p172
aVof the gay freedom struggle.
p173
aVThe first one was in 1979,
p174
aVand the second one took place in 1987.
p175
aVThe third one was held in 1993.
p176
aVAlmost a million people showed up,
p177
aVand people were so energized and excited
p178
aVby what had taken place,
p179
aVthey went back to their own communities
p180
aVand started their own political
p181
aVand social organizations,
p182
aVfurther increasing the visibility of the movement.
p183
aVThe day of that march, October 11,
p184
aVwas then declared National Coming Out Day,
p185
aVand is still celebrated all over the world.
p186
aVThese marches set the groundwork
p187
aVfor the historic changes that we see happening
p188
aVtoday in the United States.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd lastly, the "Loving" strategy.
p191
aVThe name speaks for itself.
p192
aVIn 1967, the Supreme Court ruled
p193
aVin Loving v. Virginia,
p194
aVand invalidated all laws
p195
aVthat prohibited interracial marriage.
p196
aVThis is considered one of the Supreme Court's
p197
aVlandmark civil rights cases.
p198
aVIn 1996, President Clinton signed
p199
aVthe Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA,
p200
aVand that made the federal government
p201
aVonly have to recognize marriages
p202
aVbetween a man and a woman.
p203
aVIn United States v. Windsor,
p204
aVa 79-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor
p205
aVsued the federal government
p206
aVwhen she was forced to pay estate taxes
p207
aVon her deceased wife's property,
p208
aVsomething that heterosexual  couples don't have to do.
p209
aVAnd as the case wound its way
p210
aVthrough the lower courts,
p211
aVthe Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent.
p212
aVWhen it got to the Supreme Court in 2013,
p213
aVthe Supreme Court agreed,
p214
aVand DOMA was thrown out.
p215
aVIt was incredible.
p216
aVBut the gay marriage movement
p217
aVhas been making gains for years now.
p218
aVTo date, 17 states
p219
aVhave passed laws allowing marriage equality.
p220
aVIt's become the de facto battle
p221
aVfor gay equality,
p222
aVand it seems like daily,
p223
aVlaws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts,
p224
aVeven in places like Texas and Utah,
p225
aVwhich no one saw coming.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo a lot has changed
p228
aVsince that night in 2008
p229
aVwhen I felt torn in half.
p230
aVI did go on to make that film.
p231
aVIt's a documentary film,
p232
aVand it's called "The New Black,"
p233
aVand it looks at how the African-American community
p234
aVis grappling with the gay rights issue
p235
aVin light of the gay marriage movement
p236
aVand this fight over the meaning of civil rights.
p237
aVAnd I wanted to capture
p238
aVsome of this incredible change that was happening,
p239
aVand as luck or politics would have it,
p240
aVanother marriage battle started gearing up,
p241
aVthis time in Maryland,
p242
aVwhere African-Americans make up 30 percent
p243
aVof the electorate.
p244
aVSo this tension between gay rights
p245
aVand civil rights started to bubble up once again,
p246
aVand I was lucky enough to capture
p247
aVhow some people were making the connection
p248
aVbetween the movements this time.
p249
aVThis is a clip of Karess Taylor-Hughes
p250
aVand Samantha Masters, two characters in the film,
p251
aVas they hit the streets of Baltimore
p252
aVand try to convince potential voters.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Video) Samantha Masters: That's what's up, man, this is a righteous man over here.
p255
aVOkay, are you registered to vote?
p256
aa(lp257
VMan: No. Karess Taylor-Hughes: Okay. How old are you?
p258
aa(lp259
VMan: 21. KTH: 21? You gotta get registered to vote.
p260
aa(lp261
VWe got to get you registered to vote.
p262
aa(lp263
VMan: I ain't voting on no gay shit.
p264
aa(lp265
VSM: Okay, why? What's up? Man: I ain't with that.
p266
aa(lp267
VSM: That's not cool.
p268
aa(lp269
VMan: What made you be gay? SM: So what made you be straight?
p270
aa(lp271
VSo what made you be straight?
p272
aVMan 2: You can't answer that question. (Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VKSM: I used to not have the same rights as you,
p275
aVbut I know that because a black man like yourself
p276
aVstood up for a woman like me,
p277
aVI know that I've got the same opportunities.
p278
aVSo you, as a black man, have the opportunity
p279
aVto stand up for somebody else.
p280
aVWhether you're gay or not,
p281
aVthese are your brothers and sisters out here,
p282
aVand they need you to represent.
p283
aa(lp284
VMan 2: Who is you to tell somebody
p285
aVwho they can't have sex with,
p286
aVwho they can't be with?
p287
aVThey ain't got that power.
p288
aVNobody has that power to say, you can't marry that young lady.
p289
aVWho has that power? Nobody.
p290
aa(lp291
VSM: But you know what?
p292
aVOur state has put the power in your hands,
p293
aVand so what we need you to do
p294
aVis vote for, you gonna vote for 6.
p295
aa(lp296
VMan 2: I got you.
p297
aa(lp298
VSM: Vote for 6, okay? Man 2: I got you.
p299
aa(lp300
VKSM: All right, do y'all need community service hours?
p301
aVYou do? All right, you can always volunteer with us
p302
aVto get community service hours.
p303
aVY'all want to do that?
p304
aVWe feed you. We bring you pizza.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VYoruba Richen: Thank you.
p309
aVWhat's amazing to me about that clip
p310
aVthat we just captured as we were filming
p311
aVis, it really shows how Karess
p312
aVunderstands the history of the civil rights movement,
p313
aVbut she's not restricted by it.
p314
aVShe doesn't just limit it to black people.
p315
aVShe sees it as a blueprint
p316
aVfor expanding rights to gays and lesbians.
p317
aVMaybe because she's younger, she's like 25,
p318
aVshe's able to do this a little bit more easily,
p319
aVbut the fact is that Maryland voters
p320
aVdid pass that marriage equality amendment,
p321
aVand in fact it was the first time
p322
aVthat marriage equality was directly voted on
p323
aVand passed by the voters.
p324
aVAfrican-Americans supported it at a higher level
p325
aVthan had ever been recorded.
p326
aVIt was a complete turnaround from that night
p327
aVin 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed.
p328
aVIt was, and feels, monumental.
p329
aVWe in the LGBT community have gone
p330
aVfrom being a pathologized and reviled
p331
aVand criminalized group
p332
aVto being seen as part of the great human quest
p333
aVfor dignity and equality.
p334
aVWe've gone from having to hide our sexuality
p335
aVin order to maintain our jobs and our families
p336
aVto literally getting a place at the table
p337
aVwith the president
p338
aVand a shout out at his second inauguration.
p339
aVI just want to read what he said
p340
aVat that inauguration:
p341
aV"We the people declare today
p342
aVthat the most evident of truths,
p343
aVthat all of us are created equal.
p344
aVIt is the star that guides us still,
p345
aVjust as it guided our forebears
p346
aVthrough Seneca Falls
p347
aVand Selma and Stonewall."
p348
aa(lp349
VNow we know that everything is not perfect,
p350
aVespecially when you look at what's happening
p351
aVwith the LGBT rights issue internationally,
p352
aVbut it says something about how far we've come
p353
aVwhen our president puts the gay freedom struggle
p354
aVin the context of the other great freedom struggles
p355
aVof our time: the women's rights movement
p356
aVand the civil rights movement.
p357
aVHis statement demonstrates not only
p358
aVthe interconnectedness of those movements,
p359
aVbut how each one borrowed
p360
aVand was inspired by the other.
p361
aVSo just as Martin Luther King
p362
aVlearned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics
p363
aVof civil disobedience and nonviolence,
p364
aVwhich became a bedrock of the civil rights movement,
p365
aVthe gay rights movement saw what worked
p366
aVin the civil rights movement,
p367
aVand they used some of those same strategies
p368
aVand tactics to make gains
p369
aVat an even quicker pace.
p370
aa(lp371
VMaybe one more other reason
p372
aVfor the relative quick progress
p373
aVof the gay rights movement.
p374
aVWhereas a lot of us continue to still live
p375
aVin racially segregated spaces,
p376
aVLGBT folks, we are everywhere.
p377
aVWe are in urban communities
p378
aVand rural communities,
p379
aVcommunities of color, immigrant communities,
p380
aVchurches and mosques and synagogues.
p381
aVWe are your mothers and brothers
p382
aVand sisters and sons.
p383
aVAnd when someone that you love
p384
aVor a family member comes out,
p385
aVit may be easier to support their quest for equality.
p386
aVAnd in fact, the gay rights movement
p387
aVasks us to support justice and equality
p388
aVfrom a space of love.
p389
aVThat may be the biggest, greatest gift
p390
aVthat the movement has given us.
p391
aVIt calls on us to access that which is most universal
p392
aVand most intimate:
p393
aVa love of our brother and our sister
p394
aVand our neighbor.
p395
aVI just want to end with a quote
p396
aVby one of our greatest freedom fighters
p397
aVwho's no longer with us, Nelson Mandela
p398
aVof South Africa.
p399
aVNelson Mandela led South Africa
p400
aVafter the dark and brutal days of Apartheid,
p401
aVand out of the ashes of that  legalized racial discrimination,
p402
aVhe led South Africa to become the first country
p403
aVin the world to ban discrimination
p404
aVbased on sexual orientation within its constitution.
p405
aVMandela said,
p406
aV"For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains,
p407
aVbut to live in a way that respects
p408
aVand enhances the freedom of others."
p409
aa(lp410
VSo as these movements continue on,
p411
aVand as freedom struggles around the world continue on,
p412
aVlet's remember that not only are they interconnected,
p413
aVbut they must support and enhance each other
p414
aVfor us to be truly victorious.
p415
aa(lp416
VThank you.
p417

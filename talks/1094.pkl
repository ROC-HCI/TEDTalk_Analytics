VWhen I got my current job, I was given a good piece of advice,
p5
aVwhich was to interview three politicians every day.
p6
aVAnd from that much contact with politicians,
p7
aVI can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another.
p8
aVThey have what I called "logorrhea dementia,"
p9
aVwhich is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVBut what they do have is incredible social skills.
p12
aVWhen you meet them, they lock into you,
p13
aVthey look you in the eye,
p14
aVthey invade your personal space,
p15
aVthey massage the back of your head.
p16
aa(lp17
VI had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago
p18
aVwho kept his hand on my inner thigh
p19
aVthroughout the whole meal \u2014 squeezing it.
p20
aVI once \u2014 this was years ago \u2014
p21
aVI saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate.
p22
aVAnd they were friends, and they hugged each other
p23
aVand they were laughing, and their faces were like this far apart.
p24
aVAnd they were moving and grinding
p25
aVand moving their arms up and down each other.
p26
aVAnd I was like, "Get a room. I don't want to see this."
p27
aVBut they have those social skills.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnother case:
p30
aVLast election cycle,
p31
aVI was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire,
p32
aVand he was campaigning with his five perfect sons:
p33
aVBip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVAnd he's going into a diner.
p36
aVAnd he goes into the diner, introduces himself to a family
p37
aVand says, "What village are you from in New Hampshire?"
p38
aVAnd then he describes the home he owned in their village.
p39
aVAnd so he goes around the room,
p40
aVand then as he's leaving the diner,
p41
aVhe first-names almost everybody he's just met.
p42
aVI was like, "Okay, that's social skill."
p43
aa(lp44
VBut the paradox is,
p45
aVwhen a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode,
p46
aVthat social awareness vanishes
p47
aVand they start talking like accountants.
p48
aVSo in the course of my career,
p49
aVI have covered a series of failures.
p50
aVWe sent economists in the Soviet Union
p51
aVwith privatization plans when it broke up,
p52
aVand what they really lacked was social trust.
p53
aVWe invaded Iraq with a military
p54
aVoblivious to the cultural and psychological realities.
p55
aVWe had a financial regulatory regime
p56
aVbased on the assumptions
p57
aVthat traders were rational creatures
p58
aVwho wouldn't do anything stupid.
p59
aVFor 30 years, I've been covering school reform
p60
aVand we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes \u2014
p61
aVcharters, private schools, vouchers \u2014
p62
aVbut we've had disappointing results year after year.
p63
aVAnd the fact is, people learn from people they love.
p64
aVAnd if you're not talking about the individual relationship
p65
aVbetween a teacher and a student,
p66
aVyou're not talking about that reality.
p67
aVBut that reality is expunged
p68
aVfrom our policy-making process.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd so that's led to a question for me:
p71
aVWhy are the most socially-attuned people on earth
p72
aVcompletely dehumanized
p73
aVwhen they think about policy?
p74
aVAnd I came to the conclusion,
p75
aVthis is a symptom of a larger problem.
p76
aVThat, for centuries, we've inherited a view of human nature
p77
aVbased on the notion
p78
aVthat we're divided selves,
p79
aVthat reason is separated from the emotions
p80
aVand that society progresses
p81
aVto the extent that reason can suppress the passions.
p82
aVAnd it's led to a view of human nature
p83
aVthat we're rational individuals
p84
aVwho respond in straightforward ways to incentives,
p85
aVand it's led to ways of seeing the world
p86
aVwhere people try to use the assumptions of physics
p87
aVto measure how human behavior is.
p88
aVAnd it's produced a great amputation,
p89
aVa shallow view of human nature.
p90
aa(lp91
VWe're really good at talking about material things,
p92
aVbut we're really bad at talking about emotions.
p93
aVWe're really good at talking about skills
p94
aVand safety and health;
p95
aVwe're really bad at talking about character.
p96
aVAlasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher,
p97
aVsaid that, "We have the concepts of the ancient morality
p98
aVof virtue, honor, goodness,
p99
aVbut we no longer have a system
p100
aVby which to connect them."
p101
aVAnd so this has led to a shallow path in politics,
p102
aVbut also in a whole range of human endeavors.
p103
aa(lp104
VYou can see it in the way we raise our young kids.
p105
aVYou go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon
p106
aVand you watch the kids come out,
p107
aVand they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks.
p108
aVIf the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground.
p109
aVYou see these cars that drive up \u2014
p110
aVusually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos,
p111
aVbecause in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car,
p112
aVso long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy \u2014
p113
aVthat's fine.
p114
aVThey get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms,
p115
aVwho are highly successful career women
p116
aVwho have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard.
p117
aVAnd you can usually tell the uber-moms
p118
aVbecause they actually weigh less than their own children.
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aVSo at the moment of conception,
p121
aVthey're doing little butt exercises.
p122
aVBabies flop out,
p123
aVthey're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things.
p124
aa(lp125
VDriving them home, and they want them to be enlightened,
p126
aVso they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company
p127
aVwith its own foreign policy.
p128
aVIn one of my books,
p129
aVI joke that Ben & Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste \u2014
p130
aVdoesn't kill germs, just asks them to leave.
p131
aVIt would be a big seller.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVAnd they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula,
p134
aVand Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores
p135
aVwhere all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVThey buy these seaweed-based snacks there
p138
aVcalled Veggie Booty with Kale,
p139
aVwhich is for kids who come home and say,
p140
aV"Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer."
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd so the kids are raised in a certain way,
p145
aVjumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure \u2014
p146
aVSAT prep, oboe, soccer practice.
p147
aVThey get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs,
p148
aVand sometimes they make a success of themselves
p149
aVin a superficial manner, and they make a ton of money.
p150
aVAnd sometimes you can see them at vacation places
p151
aVlike Jackson Hole or Aspen.
p152
aVAnd they've become elegant and slender \u2014
p153
aVthey don't really have thighs;
p154
aVthey just have one elegant calve on top of another.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVThey have kids of their own,
p157
aVand they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people,
p158
aVso their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein,
p159
aVtheir daughters looks like Halle Berry \u2014 I don't know how they've done that.
p160
aVThey get there and they realize
p161
aVit's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights.
p162
aVSo they've got these furry 160-pound dogs \u2014
p163
aVall look like velociraptors,
p164
aVall named after Jane Austen characters.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life,
p167
aVbut they've decided, "I've been successful at everything;
p168
aVI'm just not going to die."
p169
aVAnd so they hire personal trainers;
p170
aVthey're popping Cialis like breath mints.
p171
aVYou see them on the mountains up there.
p172
aVThey're cross-country skiing up the mountain
p173
aVwith these grim expressions
p174
aVthat make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVAnd as they whiz by you,
p177
aVit's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet
p178
aVgoing up the hill.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd so this is part of what life is,
p183
aVbut it's not all of what life is.
p184
aVAnd over the past few years,
p185
aVI think we've been given a deeper view of human nature
p186
aVand a deeper view of who we are.
p187
aVAnd it's not based on theology or philosophy,
p188
aVit's in the study of the mind,
p189
aVacross all these spheres of research,
p190
aVfrom neuroscience to the cognitive scientists,
p191
aVbehavioral economists, psychologists,
p192
aVsociology,
p193
aVwe're developing a revolution in consciousness.
p194
aVAnd when you synthesize it all,
p195
aVit's giving us a new view of human nature.
p196
aVAnd far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature,
p197
aVit's a new humanism, it's a new enchantment.
p198
aVAnd I think when you synthesize this research,
p199
aVyou start with three key insights.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe first insight is
p202
aVthat while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species,
p203
aVthe unconscious mind does most of the work.
p204
aVAnd so one way to formulate that is
p205
aVthe human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute,
p206
aVof which it can be consciously aware of about 40.
p207
aVAnd this leads to oddities.
p208
aVOne of my favorite is that people named Dennis
p209
aVare disproportionately likely to become dentists,
p210
aVpeople named Lawrence become lawyers,
p211
aVbecause unconsciously we gravitate toward things
p212
aVthat sound familiar,
p213
aVwhich is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks.
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aVAnother finding is that the unconscious,
p216
aVfar from being dumb and sexualized,
p217
aVis actually quite smart.
p218
aVSo one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture.
p219
aVIt's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house.
p220
aVAnd the way you should do that
p221
aVis study the furniture,
p222
aVlet it marinate in your mind, distract yourself,
p223
aVand then a few days later, go with your gut,
p224
aVbecause unconsciously you've figured it out.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe second insight
p227
aVis that emotions are at the center of our thinking.
p228
aVPeople with strokes and lesions
p229
aVin the emotion-processing parts of the brain
p230
aVare not super smart,
p231
aVthey're actually sometimes quite helpless.
p232
aVAnd the "giant" in the field is in the room tonight
p233
aVand is speaking tomorrow morning \u2014 Antonio Damasio.
p234
aVAnd one of the things he's really shown us
p235
aVis that emotions are not separate from reason,
p236
aVbut they are the foundation of reason
p237
aVbecause they tell us what to value.
p238
aVAnd so reading and educating your emotions
p239
aVis one of the central activities of wisdom.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow I'm a middle-aged guy.
p242
aVI'm not exactly comfortable with emotions.
p243
aVOne of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys.
p244
aVThey put them into a brain scan machine \u2014
p245
aVthis is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care \u2014
p246
aVand they had them watch a horror movie,
p247
aVand then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives.
p248
aVAnd the brain scans were identical in both activities.
p249
aVIt was just sheer terror.
p250
aVSo me talking about emotion
p251
aVis like Gandhi talking about gluttony,
p252
aVbut it is the central organizing process
p253
aVof the way we think.
p254
aVIt tells us what to imprint.
p255
aVThe brain is the record of the feelings of a life.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd the third insight
p258
aVis that we're not primarily self-contained individuals.
p259
aVWe're social animals, not rational animals.
p260
aVWe emerge out of relationships,
p261
aVand we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another.
p262
aVAnd so when we see another person,
p263
aVwe reenact in our own minds
p264
aVwhat we see in their minds.
p265
aVWhen we watch a car chase in a movie,
p266
aVit's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase.
p267
aVWhen we watch pornography,
p268
aVit's a little like having sex,
p269
aVthough probably not as good.
p270
aVAnd we see this when lovers walk down the street,
p271
aVwhen a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia
p272
aVgets caught up in an emotional contagion,
p273
aVthe deep interpenetration.
p274
aVAnd this revolution in who we are
p275
aVgives us a different way of seeing, I think, politics,
p276
aVa different way, most importantly,
p277
aVof seeing human capital.
p278
aa(lp279
VWe are now children of the French Enlightenment.
p280
aVWe believe that reason is the highest of the faculties.
p281
aVBut I think this research shows
p282
aVthat the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment,
p283
aVwith David Hume, Adam Smith,
p284
aVactually had a better handle on who we are \u2014
p285
aVthat reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong,
p286
aVand our sentiments are often trustworthy.
p287
aVAnd this work corrects that bias in our culture,
p288
aVthat dehumanizing bias.
p289
aVIt gives us a deeper sense
p290
aVof what it actually takes
p291
aVfor us to thrive in this life.
p292
aVWhen we think about human capital
p293
aVwe think about the things we can measure easily \u2014
p294
aVthings like grades, SAT's, degrees,
p295
aVthe number of years in schooling.
p296
aVWhat it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life,
p297
aVare things that are deeper,
p298
aVthings we don't really even have words for.
p299
aVAnd so let me list just a couple of the things
p300
aVI think this research points us toward trying to understand.
p301
aa(lp302
VThe first gift, or talent, is mindsight \u2014
p303
aVthe ability to enter into other people's minds
p304
aVand learn what they have to offer.
p305
aVBabies come with this ability.
p306
aVMeltzoff, who's at the University of Washington,
p307
aVleaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old.
p308
aVHe wagged his tongue at the baby.
p309
aVThe baby wagged her tongue back.
p310
aVBabies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind
p311
aVand to download what they find \u2014
p312
aVtheir models of how to understand reality.
p313
aVIn the United States, 55 percent of babies
p314
aVhave a deep two-way conversation with Mom
p315
aVand they learn models to how to relate to other people.
p316
aVAnd those people who have models of how to relate
p317
aVhave a huge head start in life.
p318
aVScientists at the University of Minnesota did a study
p319
aVin which they could predict
p320
aVwith 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months,
p321
aVwho was going to graduate from high school,
p322
aVbased on who had good attachment with mom.
p323
aVTwenty percent of kids do not have those relationships.
p324
aVThey are what we call avoidantly attached.
p325
aVThey have trouble relating to other people.
p326
aVThey go through life
p327
aVlike sailboats tacking into the wind \u2014
p328
aVwanting to get close to people,
p329
aVbut not really having the models of how to do that.
p330
aVAnd so this is one skill
p331
aVof how to hoover up knowledge, one from another.
p332
aa(lp333
VA second skill is equipoise,
p334
aVthe ability to have the serenity
p335
aVto read the biases and failures in your own mind.
p336
aVSo for example, we are overconfidence machines.
p337
aVNinety-five percent of our professors report
p338
aVthat they are above-average teachers.
p339
aVNinety-six percent of college students
p340
aVsay they have above-average social skills.
p341
aVTime magazine asked Americans, "Are you in the top one percent of earners?"
p342
aVNineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners.
p343
aV(Laughter)
p344
aVThis is a gender-linked trait, by the way.
p345
aVMen drown at twice the rate of women,
p346
aVbecause men think they can swim across that lake.
p347
aVBut some people have the ability and awareness
p348
aVof their own biases, their own overconfidence.
p349
aVThey have epistemological modesty.
p350
aVThey are open-minded in the face of ambiguity.
p351
aVThey are able to adjust strength of the conclusions
p352
aVto the strength of their evidence.
p353
aVThey are curious.
p354
aVAnd these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ.
p355
aa(lp356
VThe third trait is metis,
p357
aVwhat we might call street smarts \u2014 it's a Greek word.
p358
aVIt's a sensitivity to the physical environment,
p359
aVthe ability to pick out patterns in an environment \u2014
p360
aVderive a gist.
p361
aVOne of my colleagues at the Times
p362
aVdid a great story about soldiers in Iraq
p363
aVwho could look down a street and detect somehow
p364
aVwhether there was an IED, a landmine, in the street.
p365
aVThey couldn't tell you how they did it,
p366
aVbut they could feel cold, they felt a coldness,
p367
aVand they were more often right than wrong.
p368
aVThe third is what you might call sympathy,
p369
aVthe ability to work within groups.
p370
aVAnd that comes in tremendously handy,
p371
aVbecause groups are smarter than individuals.
p372
aVAnd face-to-face groups are much smarter
p373
aVthan groups that communicate electronically,
p374
aVbecause 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal.
p375
aVAnd the effectiveness of a group
p376
aVis not determined by the IQ of the group;
p377
aVit's determined by how well they communicate,
p378
aVhow often they take turns in conversation.
p379
aa(lp380
VThen you could talk about a trait like blending.
p381
aVAny child can say, "I'm a tiger," pretend to be a tiger.
p382
aVIt seems so elementary.
p383
aVBut in fact, it's phenomenally complicated
p384
aVto take a concept "I" and a concept "tiger"
p385
aVand blend them together.
p386
aVBut this is the source of innovation.
p387
aVWhat Picasso did, for example,
p388
aVwas take the concept "Western art"
p389
aVand the concept "African masks"
p390
aVand blend them together \u2014
p391
aVnot only the geometry,
p392
aVbut the moral systems entailed in them.
p393
aVAnd these are skills, again, we can't count and measure.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd then the final thing I'll mention
p396
aVis something you might call limerence.
p397
aVAnd this is not an ability;
p398
aVit's a drive and a motivation.
p399
aVThe conscious mind hungers for success and prestige.
p400
aVThe unconscious mind hungers
p401
aVfor those moments of transcendence,
p402
aVwhen the skull line disappears
p403
aVand we are lost in a challenge or a task \u2014
p404
aVwhen a craftsman feels lost in his craft,
p405
aVwhen a naturalist feels at one with nature,
p406
aVwhen a believer feels at one with God's love.
p407
aVThat is what the unconscious mind hungers for.
p408
aVAnd many of us feel it in love
p409
aVwhen lovers feel fused.
p410
aa(lp411
VAnd one of the most beautiful descriptions
p412
aVI've come across in this research
p413
aVof how minds interpenetrate
p414
aVwas written by a great theorist and scientist
p415
aVnamed Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana.
p416
aVHe was married to a woman named Carol,
p417
aVand they had a wonderful relationship.
p418
aVWhen their kids were five and two,
p419
aVCarol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly.
p420
aVAnd Hofstadter wrote a book
p421
aVcalled "I Am a Strange Loop."
p422
aVIn the course of that book, he describes a moment \u2014
p423
aVjust months after Carol has died \u2014
p424
aVhe comes across her picture on the mantel,
p425
aVor on a bureau in his bedroom.
p426
aa(lp427
VAnd here's what he wrote:
p428
aV"I looked at her face,
p429
aVand I looked so deeply
p430
aVthat I felt I was behind her eyes.
p431
aVAnd all at once I found myself saying
p432
aVas tears flowed,
p433
aV'That's me. That's me.'
p434
aVAnd those simple words
p435
aVbrought back many thoughts that I had had before,
p436
aVabout the fusion of our souls
p437
aVinto one higher-level entity,
p438
aVabout the fact that at the core of both our souls
p439
aVlay our identical hopes and dreams for our children,
p440
aVabout the notion that those hopes
p441
aVwere not separate or distinct hopes,
p442
aVbut were just one hope,
p443
aVone clear thing that defined us both,
p444
aVthat welded us into a unit \u2014
p445
aVthe kind of unit I had but dimly imagined
p446
aVbefore being married and having children.
p447
aVI realized that, though Carol had died,
p448
aVthat core piece of her had not died at all,
p449
aVbut had lived on very determinedly in my brain."
p450

p459
aVto get the depths of who we are,

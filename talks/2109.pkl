VAlmost a year ago,
p5
aVmy aunt started suffering back pains.
p6
aVShe went to see the doctor
p7
aVand they told her it was a normal injury
p8
aVfor someone who had been playing tennis
p9
aVfor almost 30 years.
p10
aVThey recommended that she do some therapy,
p11
aVbut after a while she wasn't feeling better,
p12
aVso the doctors decided to do further tests.
p13
aVThey did an x-ray
p14
aVand discovered an injury in her lungs,
p15
aVand at the time they thought that the injury
p16
aVwas a strain in the muscles and tendons
p17
aVbetween her ribs,
p18
aVbut after a few weeks of treatment,
p19
aVagain her health wasn't getting any better.
p20
aVSo finally, they decided to do a biopsy,
p21
aVand two weeks later,
p22
aVthe results of the biopsy came back.
p23
aVIt was stage 3 lung cancer.
p24
aa(lp25
VHer lifestyle was almost free of risk.
p26
aVShe never smoked a cigarette,
p27
aVshe never drank alcohol,
p28
aVand she had been playing sports
p29
aVfor almost half her life.
p30
aVPerhaps, that is why it took them almost six months
p31
aVto get her properly diagnosed.
p32
aa(lp33
VMy story might be, unfortunately,
p34
aVfamiliar to most of you.
p35
aVOne out of three people sitting in this audience
p36
aVwill be diagnosed with some type of cancer,
p37
aVand one out of four
p38
aVwill die because of it.
p39
aVNot only did that cancer diagnosis
p40
aVchange the life of our family,
p41
aVbut that process of going
p42
aVback and forth with new tests,
p43
aVdifferent doctors describing symptoms,
p44
aVdiscarding diseases over and over,
p45
aVwas stressful and frustrating,
p46
aVespecially for my aunt.
p47
aVAnd that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done
p48
aVsince the beginning of history.
p49
aVWe have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs
p50
aVto treat cancer,
p51
aVbut we still have 20th-century procedures
p52
aVand processes for diagnosis, if any.
p53
aa(lp54
VToday, most of us have to wait for symptoms
p55
aVto indicate that something is wrong.
p56
aVToday, the majority of people still don't have access
p57
aVto early cancer detection methods,
p58
aVeven though we know
p59
aVthat catching cancer early
p60
aVis basically the closest thing we have
p61
aVto a silver bullet cure against it.
p62
aVWe know that we can change this in our lifetime,
p63
aVand that is why my team and I
p64
aVhave decided to begin this journey,
p65
aVthis journey to try to make cancer detection
p66
aVat the early stages
p67
aVand monitoring the appropriate  response at the molecular level
p68
aVeasier, cheaper, smarter
p69
aVand more accessible than ever before.
p70
aa(lp71
VThe context, of course,
p72
aVis that we're living at a time
p73
aVwhere technology is disrupting our present
p74
aVat exponential rates,
p75
aVand the biological realm is no exception.
p76
aVIt is said today that biotech is advancing
p77
aVat least six times faster than the growth rate
p78
aVof the processing power of computers.
p79
aVBut progress in biotech
p80
aVis not only being accelerated,
p81
aVit is also being democratized.
p82
aVJust as personal computers or the Internet
p83
aVor smartphones leveled the playing field
p84
aVfor entrepreneurship, politics or education,
p85
aVrecent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well,
p86
aVand that is allowing
p87
aVmultidisciplinary teams like ours
p88
aVto try to tackle and look at these problems
p89
aVwith new approaches.
p90
aa(lp91
VWe are a team of scientists and technologists
p92
aVfrom Chile, Panama,
p93
aVMexico, Israel and Greece,
p94
aVand based on recent scientific discoveries,
p95
aVwe believe that we have found
p96
aVa reliable and accurate way
p97
aVof detecting several types of cancer
p98
aVat the very early stages through a blood sample.
p99
aVWe do it by detecting a set of very small molecules
p100
aVthat circulate freely in our blood
p101
aVcalled microRNAs.
p102
aa(lp103
VTo explain what microRNAs are
p104
aVand their important role in cancer,
p105
aVI need to start with proteins,
p106
aVbecause when cancer is present in our body,
p107
aVprotein modification is observed
p108
aVin all cancerous cells.
p109
aVAs you might know,
p110
aVproteins are large biological molecules
p111
aVthat perform different functions within our body,
p112
aVlike catalyzing metabolic reactions
p113
aVor responding to stimuli
p114
aVor replicating DNA,
p115
aVbut before a protein is expressed or produced,
p116
aVrelevant parts of its genetic code
p117
aVpresent in the DNA
p118
aVare copied into the messenger RNA,
p119
aVso this messenger RNA
p120
aVhas instructions on how to build a specific protein,
p121
aVand potentially it can build hundreds of proteins,
p122
aVbut the one that tells them when to build them
p123
aVand how many to build
p124
aVare microRNAs.
p125
aVSo microRNAs are small molecules
p126
aVthat regulate gene expression.
p127
aVUnlike DNA, which is mainly fixed,
p128
aVmicroRNAs can vary depending on internal
p129
aVand environmental conditions at any given time,
p130
aVtelling us which genes are actively  expressed at that particular moment.
p131
aVAnd that is what makes microRNAs
p132
aVsuch a promising biomarker for cancer,
p133
aVbecause as you know,
p134
aVcancer is a disease of altered gene expression.
p135
aVIt is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.
p136
aVAnother important thing to consider
p137
aVis that no two cancers are the same,
p138
aVbut at the microRNA level, there are patterns.
p139
aVSeveral scientific studies have shown
p140
aVthat abnormal microRNA expression levels
p141
aVvaries and creates a unique, specific pattern
p142
aVfor each type of cancer,
p143
aVeven at the early stages,
p144
aVreflecting the progression of the disease,
p145
aVand whether it's responding to medication
p146
aVor in remission,
p147
aVmaking microRNAs a perfect,
p148
aVhighly sensitive biomarker.
p149
aa(lp150
VHowever, the problem with microRNAs
p151
aVis that we cannot use existing DNA-based technology
p152
aVto detect them in a reliable way,
p153
aVbecause they are very short sequences of nucleotides,
p154
aVmuch smaller than DNA.
p155
aVAnd also, all microRNAs are very similar to each other,
p156
aVwith just tiny differences.
p157
aVSo imagine trying to differentiate two molecules,
p158
aVextremely similar, extremely small.
p159
aa(lp160
VWe believe that we have found a way to do so,
p161
aVand this is the first time that we've shown it in public.
p162
aVLet me do a demonstration.
p163
aVImagine that next time you go to your doctor
p164
aVand do your next standard blood test,
p165
aVa lab technician extracts a total RNA,
p166
aVwhich is quite simple today,
p167
aVand puts it in a standard  96-well plate like this one.
p168
aVEach well of these plates
p169
aVhas specific biochemistry that we assign,
p170
aVthat is looking for a specific microRNA,
p171
aVacting like a trap that closes
p172
aVonly when the microRNA is present in the sample,
p173
aVand when it does, it will shine with green color.
p174
aVTo run the reaction,
p175
aVyou put the plate inside a device like this one,
p176
aVand then you can put your smartphone on top of it.
p177
aVIf we can have a camera here
p178
aVso you can see my screen.
p179
aVA smartphone is a connected computer
p180
aVand it's also a camera,
p181
aVgood enough for our purpose.
p182
aVThe smartphone is taking pictures,
p183
aVand when the reaction is over,
p184
aVit will send the pictures
p185
aVto our online database for processing
p186
aVand interpretation.
p187
aVThis entire process lasts around 60 minutes,
p188
aVbut when the process is over,
p189
aVwells that shine are matched  with the specific microRNAs
p190
aVand analyzed in terms of how much and how fast
p191
aVthey shine.
p192
aVAnd then, when this entire process is over,
p193
aVthis is what happens.
p194
aVThis chart is showing the specific microRNAs
p195
aVpresent in this sample
p196
aVand how they reacted over time.
p197
aVThen, if we take this specific pattern of microRNA
p198
aVof this person's samples
p199
aVand compare it with existing scientific documentation
p200
aVthat correlates microRNA patterns
p201
aVwith a specific presence of a disease,
p202
aVthis is how pancreatic cancer looks like.
p203
aVThis inside is a real sample
p204
aVwhere we just detected pancreatic cancer.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
VAnother important aspect of this approach
p209
aVis the gathering and mining of data in the cloud,
p210
aVso we can get results in real time
p211
aVand analyze them with our contextual information.
p212
aVIf we want to better understand
p213
aVand decode diseases like cancer,
p214
aVwe need to stop treating them
p215
aVas acute, isolated episodes,
p216
aVand consider and measure everything
p217
aVthat affects our health on a permanent basis.
p218
aVThis entire platform is a working prototype.
p219
aVIt uses state-of-the-art molecular biology,
p220
aVa low-cost, 3D-printed device,
p221
aVand data science
p222
aVto try to tackle one of humanity's  toughest challenges.
p223
aVSince we believe early cancer detection
p224
aVshould really be democratized,
p225
aVthis entire solution costs at least 50 times less
p226
aVthan current available methods,
p227
aVand we know that the community can help us
p228
aVaccelerate this even more,
p229
aVso we're making the design of the device
p230
aVopen-source.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
VLet me say very clearly
p235
aVthat we are at the very early stages,
p236
aVbut so far, we have been able
p237
aVto successfully identify the microRNA pattern
p238
aVof pancreatic cancer, lung cancer,
p239
aVbreast cancer and hepatic cancer.
p240
aVAnd currently, we're doing a clinical trial
p241
aVin collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center
p242
aVwith 200 women for breast cancer.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Applause)
p245
aVThis is the single non-invasive,
p246
aVaccurate and affordable test
p247
aVthat has the potential to dramatically change
p248
aVhow cancer procedures and diagnostics
p249
aVhave been done.
p250
aVSince we're looking for the microRNA patterns
p251
aVin your blood at any given time,
p252
aVyou don't need to know which cancer you're looking for.
p253
aVYou don't need to have any symptoms.
p254
aVYou only need one milliliter of blood
p255
aVand a relatively simple array of tools.
p256
aa(lp257
VToday, cancer detection happens mainly
p258
aVwhen symptoms appear.
p259
aVThat is, at stage 3 or 4,
p260
aVand I believe that is too late.
p261
aVIt is too expensive for our families.
p262
aVIt is too expensive for humanity.
p263
aVWe cannot lose the war against cancer.
p264
aVIt not only costs us billions of dollars,
p265
aVbut it also costs us the people we love.
p266
aVToday, my aunt, she's fighting bravely
p267
aVand going through this process with a very positive attitude.
p268
aVHowever, I want fights like this
p269
aVto become very rare.
p270
aVI want to see the day
p271
aVwhen cancer is treated easily
p272
aVbecause it can be routinely diagnosed
p273
aVat the very early stages,
p274
aVand I'm certain
p275
aVthat in the very near future,
p276
aVbecause of this
p277
aVand other breakthroughs that we are seeing
p278
aVevery day in the life sciences,
p279
aVthe way we see cancer
p280
aVwill radically change.
p281
aVIt will give us the chance of detecting it early,
p282
aVunderstanding it better,
p283
aVand finding a cure.
p284
aa(lp285
VThank you very much.

VI'd like to tell you about two games of chess.
p5
aVThe first happened in 1997, in which Garry Kasparov,
p6
aVa human, lost to Deep Blue, a machine.
p7
aVTo many, this was the dawn of a new era,
p8
aVone where man would be dominated by machine.
p9
aVBut here we are, 20 years on, and the greatest change
p10
aVin how we relate to computers is the iPad,
p11
aVnot HAL.
p12
aa(lp13
VThe second game was a freestyle chess tournament
p14
aVin 2005, in which man and machine could enter together
p15
aVas partners, rather than adversaries, if they so chose.
p16
aVAt first, the results were predictable.
p17
aVEven a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster
p18
aVwith a relatively weak laptop.
p19
aVThe surprise came at the end. Who won?
p20
aVNot a grandmaster with a supercomputer,
p21
aVbut actually two American amateurs
p22
aVusing three relatively weak laptops.
p23
aVTheir ability to coach and manipulate their computers
p24
aVto deeply explore specific positions
p25
aVeffectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge
p26
aVof the grandmasters and the superior computational power
p27
aVof other adversaries.
p28
aVThis is an astonishing result: average men,
p29
aVaverage machines beating the best man, the best machine.
p30
aVAnd anyways, isn't it supposed to be man versus machine?
p31
aVInstead, it's about cooperation, and the right type of cooperation.
p32
aa(lp33
VWe've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's
p34
aVvision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years.
p35
aVIt's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it.
p36
aVIt's become the dominant school of thought in computer science.
p37
aVBut as we enter the era of big data, of network systems,
p38
aVof open platforms, and embedded technology,
p39
aVI'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision
p40
aVthat was actually developed around the same time.
p41
aVI'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human-computer symbiosis,
p42
aVperhaps better termed "intelligence augmentation," I.A.
p43
aa(lp44
VLicklider was a computer science titan who had a profound
p45
aVeffect on the development of technology and the Internet.
p46
aVHis vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate
p47
aVin making decisions, controlling complex situations
p48
aVwithout the inflexible dependence
p49
aVon predetermined programs.
p50
aVNote that word "cooperate."
p51
aVLicklider encourages us not to take a toaster
p52
aVand make it Data from "Star Trek,"
p53
aVbut to take a human and make her more capable.
p54
aVHumans are so amazing \u2014 how we think,
p55
aVour non-linear approaches, our creativity,
p56
aViterative hypotheses, all very difficult if possible at all
p57
aVfor computers to do.
p58
aVLicklider intuitively realized this, contemplating humans
p59
aVsetting the goals, formulating the hypotheses,
p60
aVdetermining the criteria, and performing the evaluation.
p61
aVOf course, in other ways, humans are so limited.
p62
aVWe're terrible at scale, computation and volume.
p63
aVWe require high-end talent management
p64
aVto keep the rock band together and playing.
p65
aVLicklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work
p66
aVthat was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making.
p67
aa(lp68
VSilently, without much fanfare,
p69
aVthis approach has been compiling victories beyond chess.
p70
aVProtein folding, a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess \u2014
p71
aVthere are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe.
p72
aVThis is a world-changing problem with huge implications
p73
aVfor our ability to understand and treat disease.
p74
aVAnd for this task, supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough.
p75
aVFoldit, a game created by computer scientists,
p76
aVillustrates the value of the approach.
p77
aVNon-technical, non-biologist amateurs play a video game
p78
aVin which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein,
p79
aVallowing the computer to manage the atomic forces
p80
aVand interactions and identify structural issues.
p81
aVThis approach beat supercomputers 50 percent of the time
p82
aVand tied 30 percent of the time.
p83
aVFoldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery
p84
aVby deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus.
p85
aVA protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years
p86
aVwas solved was by three players in a matter of days,
p87
aVperhaps the first major scientific advance
p88
aVto come from playing a video game.
p89
aa(lp90
VLast year, on the site of the Twin Towers,
p91
aVthe 9/11 memorial opened.
p92
aVIt displays the names of the thousands of victims
p93
aVusing a beautiful concept called "meaningful adjacency."
p94
aVIt places the names next to each other based on their
p95
aVrelationships to one another: friends, families, coworkers.
p96
aVWhen you put it all together, it's quite a computational
p97
aVchallenge: 3,500 victims, 1,800 adjacency requests,
p98
aVthe importance of the overall physical specifications
p99
aVand the final aesthetics.
p100
aVWhen first reported by the media, full credit for such a feat
p101
aVwas given to an algorithm from the New York City
p102
aVdesign firm Local Projects. The truth is a bit more nuanced.
p103
aVWhile an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework,
p104
aVhumans used that framework to design the final result.
p105
aVSo in this case, a computer had evaluated millions
p106
aVof possible layouts, managed a complex relational system,
p107
aVand kept track of a very large set of measurements
p108
aVand variables, allowing the humans to focus
p109
aVon design and compositional choices.
p110
aVSo the more you look around you,
p111
aVthe more you see Licklider's vision everywhere.
p112
aVWhether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car,
p113
aVhuman-computer symbiosis is making us more capable.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis,
p116
aVwhat can you do?
p117
aVYou can start by designing the human into the process.
p118
aVInstead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem,
p119
aVdesign the solution around what the human will do as well.
p120
aVWhen you do this, you'll quickly realize that you spent
p121
aVall of your time on the interface between man and machine,
p122
aVspecifically on designing away the friction in the interaction.
p123
aVIn fact, this friction is more important than the power
p124
aVof the man or the power of the machine
p125
aVin determining overall capability.
p126
aVThat's why two amateurs with a few laptops
p127
aVhandily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster.
p128
aVWhat Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction.
p129
aVThe better the process, the less the friction.
p130
aVAnd minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable.
p131
aa(lp132
VOr take another example: big data.
p133
aVEvery interaction we have in the world is recorded
p134
aVby an ever growing array of sensors: your phone,
p135
aVyour credit card, your computer. The result is big data,
p136
aVand it actually presents us with an opportunity
p137
aVto more deeply understand the human condition.
p138
aVThe major emphasis of most approaches to big data
p139
aVfocus on, "How do I store this data? How do I search
p140
aVthis data? How do I process this data?"
p141
aVThese are necessary but insufficient questions.
p142
aVThe imperative is not to figure out how to compute,
p143
aVbut what to compute. How do you impose human intuition
p144
aVon data at this scale?
p145
aa(lp146
VAgain, we start by designing the human into the process.
p147
aVWhen PayPal was first starting as a business, their biggest
p148
aVchallenge was not, "How do I send money back and forth online?"
p149
aVIt was, "How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime?"
p150
aVWhy so challenging? Because while computers can learn
p151
aVto detect and identify fraud based on patterns,
p152
aVthey can't learn to do that based on patterns
p153
aVthey've never seen before, and organized crime
p154
aVhas a lot in common with this audience: brilliant people,
p155
aVrelentlessly resourceful, entrepreneurial spirit \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p156
aVand one huge and important difference: purpose.
p157
aVAnd so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest
p158
aVfraudsters, catching the cleverest is the difference
p159
aVbetween success and failure.
p160
aa(lp161
VThere's a whole class of problems like this, ones with
p162
aVadaptive adversaries. They rarely if ever present with a
p163
aVrepeatable pattern that's discernable to computers.
p164
aVInstead, there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption,
p165
aVand increasingly these problems are buried in big data.
p166
aa(lp167
VFor example, terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting
p168
aVin minor and major ways to new circumstances, and despite
p169
aVwhat you might see on TV, these adaptations,
p170
aVand the detection of them, are fundamentally human.
p171
aVComputers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors,
p172
aVbut humans do. Humans, using technology, testing hypotheses,
p173
aVsearching for insight by asking machines to do things for them.
p174
aVOsama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence.
p175
aVHe was caught by dedicated, resourceful, brilliant people
p176
aVin partnerships with various technologies.
p177
aa(lp178
VAs appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically
p179
aVdata mine your way to the answer.
p180
aVThere is no "Find Terrorist" button, and the more data
p181
aVwe integrate from a vast variety of sources
p182
aVacross a wide variety of data formats from very
p183
aVdisparate systems, the less effective data mining can be.
p184
aVInstead, people will have to look at data
p185
aVand search for insight, and as Licklider foresaw long ago,
p186
aVthe key to great results here is the right type of cooperation,
p187
aVand as Kasparov realized,
p188
aVthat means minimizing friction at the interface.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow this approach makes possible things like combing
p191
aVthrough all available data from very different sources,
p192
aVidentifying key relationships and putting them in one place,
p193
aVsomething that's been nearly impossible to do before.
p194
aVTo some, this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties
p195
aVimplications. To others it foretells of an era of greater
p196
aVprivacy and civil liberties protections,
p197
aVbut privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance.
p198
aVThat must be acknowledged, and they can't be swept aside,
p199
aVeven with the best of intents.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo let's explore, through a couple of examples, the impact
p202
aVthat technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis
p203
aVhave had in recent time.
p204
aa(lp205
VIn October, 2007, U.S. and coalition forces raided
p206
aVan al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar
p207
aVon the Syrian border of Iraq.
p208
aVThey found a treasure trove of documents:
p209
aV700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters.
p210
aVThese foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf,
p211
aVthe Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq.
p212
aVThese records were human resource forms.
p213
aVThe foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization.
p214
aVIt turns out that al Qaeda, too,
p215
aVis not without its bureaucracy. (Laughter)
p216
aVThey answered questions like, "Who recruited you?"
p217
aV"What's your hometown?" "What occupation do you seek?"
p218
aa(lp219
VIn that last question, a surprising insight was revealed.
p220
aVThe vast majority of foreign fighters
p221
aVwere seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom \u2014
p222
aVhugely important, since between 2003 and 2007, Iraq
p223
aVhad 1,382 suicide bombings, a major source of instability.
p224
aVAnalyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets
p225
aVof paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated.
p226
aVThe friction in the process did not allow for meaningful
p227
aVresults in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs
p228
aVand tenacity alone.
p229
aVThe researchers had to lever up their human minds
p230
aVwith technology to dive deeper, to explore non-obvious
p231
aVhypotheses, and in fact, insights emerged.
p232
aVTwenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya,
p233
aV50 percent of those from a single town in Libya,
p234
aVhugely important since prior statistics put that figure at
p235
aVthree percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure
p236
aVof rising importance in al Qaeda, Abu Yahya al-Libi,
p237
aVa senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group.
p238
aVIn March of 2007, he gave a speech, after which there was
p239
aVa surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters.
p240
aa(lp241
VPerhaps most clever of all, though, and least obvious,
p242
aVby flipping the data on its head, the researchers were
p243
aVable to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria
p244
aVthat were ultimately responsible for receiving and
p245
aVtransporting the foreign fighters to the border.
p246
aVThese were networks of mercenaries, not ideologues,
p247
aVwho were in the coordination business for profit.
p248
aVFor example, they charged Saudi foreign fighters
p249
aVsubstantially more than Libyans, money that would have
p250
aVotherwise gone to al Qaeda.
p251
aVPerhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network
p252
aVif they knew they cheating would-be jihadists.
p253
aa(lp254
VIn January, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti,
p255
aVthird deadliest earthquake of all time, left one million people,
p256
aV10 percent of the population, homeless.
p257
aVOne seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort
p258
aVbecame increasingly important as the delivery of food
p259
aVand water started rolling.
p260
aVJanuary and February are the dry months in Haiti,
p261
aVyet many of the camps had developed standing water.
p262
aVThe only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's
p263
aVfloodplains had been leveled
p264
aVin the earthquake, leadership inside.
p265
aVSo the question is, which camps are at risk,
p266
aVhow many people are in these camps, what's the
p267
aVtimeline for flooding, and given very limited resources
p268
aVand infrastructure, how do we prioritize the relocation?
p269
aVThe data was incredibly disparate. The U.S. Army had
p270
aVdetailed knowledge for only a small section of the country.
p271
aVThere was data online from a 2006 environmental risk
p272
aVconference, other geospatial data, none of it integrated.
p273
aVThe human goal here was to identify camps for relocation
p274
aVbased on priority need.
p275
aVThe computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial
p276
aVinformation, social media data and relief organization
p277
aVinformation to answer this question.
p278
aVBy implementing a superior process, what was otherwise
p279
aVa task for 40 people over three months became
p280
aVa simple job for three people in 40 hours,
p281
aa(lp282
Vall victories for human-computer symbiosis.
p283
aa(lp284
VWe're more than 50 years into Licklider's vision
p285
aVfor the future, and the data suggests that we should be
p286
aVquite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems,
p287
aVman and machine in cooperation together.
p288
aVThank you. (Applause)

VYou all know this story.
p5
aVIn the summer of 1950,
p6
aVEnrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist
p7
aVand atomic-pile builder,
p8
aVwent to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory
p9
aVand joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:
p10
aV"Where is everybody?"
p11
aVThis confused his colleagues, obviously,
p12
aVbecause they were sitting right there with him.
p13
aVAnd then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.
p14
aVHe was talking about the space aliens.
p15
aa(lp16
VYou see, this was only a few years after
p17
aVthe supposed flying saucer crash
p18
aVat Roswell, New Mexico.
p19
aVAnd even though that turned out to be nothing,
p20
aVnothing at all \u2014
p21
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p22
aVmerely a downed weather balloon
p23
aVpiloted by small hairless men
p24
aVwith slits for mouths ...
p25
aVStill, America had gone saucer-mad,
p26
aVeven famous scientists
p27
aVwho were eating lunch.
p28
aVFermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,
p29
aVis that the universe is so vast
p30
aVthat it stands to reason,
p31
aVthere should be other intelligent life out there.
p32
aVAnd the universe is so old
p33
aVthat unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,
p34
aVwe should have some evidence of their existence by now.
p35
aVAnd yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.
p36
aa(lp37
V"Where is everybody?" asked Fermi,
p38
aVand his colleagues had no answer.
p39
aVFermi then went on with the same blunt logic
p40
aVto disprove fairies,
p41
aVSasquatch, God,
p42
aVthe possibility of love \u2014
p43
aVand thereafter, as you know,
p44
aVEnrico Fermi ate alone.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVNow,
p47
aVI am not a scientist.
p48
aVI have never built an atomic pile.
p49
aVAlthough, I might argue that, technically,
p50
aVevery pile is atomic.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VHowever, with respect, I might point out two possibilities
p55
aVthat Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.
p56
aVOne is that the aliens might be
p57
aVvery far away.
p58
aVPerhaps, I dare say,
p59
aVeven on other planets.
p60
aVThe other possibility \u2014
p61
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p62
aVis, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself
p63
aVwas an alien.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VThink about it.
p68
aVIsn't it a little convenient
p69
aVthat in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,
p70
aVsuddenly an Italian scientist showed up
p71
aVwith an amazing new technology
p72
aVthat would transform everything in the world
p73
aVand darken the history of the human species forever after?
p74
aVAnd isn't it a little strange
p75
aVthat he required no payment for this?
p76
aVThat he asked for only one thing \u2014
p77
aVa gift of two healthy sperm whales?
p78
aVThat's \u2014 that's not true.
p79
aVBut it is strange.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,
p84
aVwouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince
p85
aVhis fellow scientists
p86
aVthat the space aliens are not already here?
p87
aVFor it is given in certain UFO-ology
p88
aVor UFOlogy circles,
p89
aVthat the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;
p90
aVthat they have walked among us in disguise,
p91
aVobserving us, guiding our evolution
p92
aVfrom ape to man \u2014
p93
aVif you believe in that sort of thing \u2014
p94
aVand, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers
p95
aVand taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VIt's a difficult theory to discount,
p100
aVI think you'll agree.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VFor even in my own life,
p105
aVthere are memories I have
p106
aVthat are difficult to explain \u2014
p107
aVhappenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,
p108
aVthat it is difficult to imagine
p109
aVthey were not the result
p110
aVof prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.
p111
aVFor how else will you explain
p112
aVthe amazing and absolutely true
p113
aVclose encounters that I had
p114
aVand will describe to you now?
p115
aVEncounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.
p116
aVThis was the summer when the special edition of
p117
aV"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was released.
p118
aVAnd I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.
p119
aVWithin 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,
p120
aVjust like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd so I spent the rest of the vacation
p125
aVlargely sitting outside our little rental house at night,
p126
aVthe sidewalk still warm from the sun,
p127
aVwatching the skies for UFOs.
p128
aVWhat did I see? Stars, satellites,
p129
aVblinking airplanes \u2014 typical sky junk.
p130
aVOccasionally, kids would come and
p131
aVjoin me and watch,
p132
aVbut their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk
p133
aVto play video games and mingle with humans.
p134
aVI was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,
p135
aVso I stayed alone with the cosmos.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd that's when it happened.
p138
aVAn elderly couple came walking down the street.
p139
aVI would say they were in their late seventies,
p140
aVand I would say that they were on a date,
p141
aVbecause he was wearing a very neat little suit
p142
aVwith a yellow tie \u2014 a brown suit.
p143
aVAnd she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night
p144
aVand a chill was coming in off the ocean.
p145
aVI remember, for some reason,
p146
aVthat they were exactly the same height.
p147
aVAnd then they stopped, and the man turned to me
p148
aVand said,
p149
aV"What are you looking for,
p150
aVflying saucers?"
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VYou have to admit, that's a pretty boss piece of detective work
p155
aVfor an old man on a date.
p156
aVBut what was stranger still \u2014
p157
aVand even I realized it at the time,
p158
aVas a nine-year-old child \u2014
p159
aVwas that they stopped at all.
p160
aVThat this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll
p161
aVwith his sweetheart with the precise reason
p162
aVof making fun of a child.
p163
aV"Oh," he said,
p164
aV"little green men."
p165
aVAnd then his girlfriend joined in, too.
p166
aV"There's no such thing as space men," she said.
p167
aV"There's no such thing."
p168
aVAnd then they both laughed. "Ha, ha, ha."
p169
aVI looked around.
p170
aVThe street was entirely empty.
p171
aVI had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.
p172
aVIt was as though time had stopped.
p173
aVI did not know why they were teasing me.
p174
aVI looked into their strangely angry faces,
p175
aVand I remember wondering,
p176
aVare they wearing rubber masks?
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd what would be behind those rubber masks, if they were?
p181
aVGiant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes?
p182
aVSlits for mouths?
p183
aVThe old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun,
p184
aVand then he made laser sounds.
p185
aV"Kew, kew, kew \u2014
p186
aVwatch out."
p187
aVAnd they turned at once and walked away.
p188
aVThe old man reached out
p189
aVhis knobbly claw
p190
aVfor the woman's hand,
p191
aVand found it, and left me alone.
p192
aVNow, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding \u2014
p193
aVa strange encounter among humans.
p194
aVMaybe it was swamp gas, but \u2014
p195
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p196
aVI know what I saw.
p197
aa(lp198
VClose encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984.
p199
aVI went to see the movie "Dune,"
p200
aVand a girl talked to me. Now, on its face \u2014
p201
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p202
aVthis is impossible on its face, I realize \u2014
p203
aVbut it is absolutely true.
p204
aVIt was opening night, naturally.
p205
aVI went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.
p206
aVOn my right was the girl in question.
p207
aVShe had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.
p208
aVI remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,
p209
aVan Ace bandage, and she had crutches.
p210
aVShe was very tall, I would say.
p211
aVI was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,
p212
aVbut I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school.
p213
aVI didn't know her name, and I never will.
p214
aVShe was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,
p215
aVand they were talking about the novel, "Dune."
p216
aVThey were both big fans, mother and daughter \u2014
p217
aVvery unusual.
p218
aVThey were talking about how their favorite characters
p219
aVwere the giant sandworms.
p220
aVAnd then it got stranger.
p221
aVThat's when she turned to me and said,
p222
aV"Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?"
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VFirst of all, I was embarrassed
p227
aVbecause I had not read the novel "Dune" at that time.
p228
aVI was merely a connoisseur of movies
p229
aVfeaturing desert planets, as I still am.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aVBut it was also the tone of how she asked the question:
p233
aVapropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer,
p234
aVas though she just wanted to talk to me.
p235
aVI did not know what to say. I said, "Yes."
p236
aVI did not even turn my head.
p237
aVThe movie began.
p238
aVI need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of "Dune,"
p239
aVin which all of the characters
p240
aVwere sexy and deformed at the same time.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VThere was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator,
p245
aVwhich was a kind of giant, floating fetus-creature
p246
aVthat lived in a giant tank with this orange mist
p247
aVof psychedelic spice
p248
aVswirling around him,
p249
aVallowing him to bend space and time.
p250
aVHe could never leave the tank
p251
aVor interact with the outside world.
p252
aVHe had become, in his isolation,
p253
aVso deformed and so sexy,
p254
aVthat he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio
p255
aVto the outside world, and could never touch them.
p256
aVI mean, I liked him a lot better than the sandworms.
p257
aVThe sandworms were fine, but your favorite character?
p258
aVPlease.
p259
aa(lp260
VWhen the movie ended,
p261
aVeveryone seemed very happy
p262
aVto get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible.
p263
aVExcept for the girl.
p264
aVAs I walked out, her pace slowed.
p265
aVPerhaps it was the crutches,
p266
aVbut it seemed \u2014
p267
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p268
aVit seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.
p269
aVWhen I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous,
p270
aVbut I can only come to the conclusion
p271
aVthat it was what, in the alien abductee community,
p272
aVthey call a "screen memory":
p273
aVa ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain
p274
aVto cover up some trauma \u2014 say, of being kidnapped
p275
aVand flown off to a sex pyramid.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd so I sure am glad
p280
aVI did not slow down to talk to her.
p281
aVI sure am glad I never saw her again.
p282
aa(lp283
VClose encounter three: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
p284
aV1989.
p285
aVIn the mid-to-late '80s,
p286
aVthe novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called "Communion,"
p287
aVin which he described his own lifelong experiences
p288
aVbeing abducted by aliens.
p289
aVAnd he also described the phenomenon known in this community
p290
aVas "lost time,"
p291
aVwhere Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware
p292
aVthat he could not remember the previous ten minutes,
p293
aVor the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days.
p294
aVAnd would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens
p295
aVwere taking him and giving him rectal probes.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VThis book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.
p300
aVThis image by Ted Joseph was from that book,
p301
aVand was his, sort of, police sketch
p302
aVof what the creatures looked like
p303
aVthat Whitley Strieber had described to him.
p304
aVAnd it was so successful that they made it into a movie.
p305
aVAnd in 1989, the way I remember it,
p306
aVI was in Philadelphia
p307
aVvisiting my girlfriend, and we decided,
p308
aVapropos of nothing, to go see this movie.
p309
aVAnd the way I remember it, the movie featured these details.
p310
aVOne: Whitley Strieber
p311
aVwas played by Christopher Walken.
p312
aVTwo: the alien was played by a rubber puppet.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VThree: there was a surprisingly long
p317
aVsequence of the film in which the rubber puppet
p318
aVgives Christopher Walken a rectal probe.
p319
aVFour: this was being shown
p320
aVin a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia.
p321
aVFive: all of which is to say,
p322
aVthey made a movie out of the book, "Communion,"
p323
aVand it starred Christopher Walken.
p324
aVDoes something seem strange about this to you?
p325
aVSomething odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture?
p326
aVThink about it. Yes. The answer is:
p327
aVI had a girlfriend. What?
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VHow did this happen? When did this happen?
p332
aVI remember walking out of the theater
p333
aVand becoming suddenly aware of this fact,
p334
aVas we walked hand in hand,
p335
aVand pondering these very same questions.
p336
aVAnd to this day, I have no answer for you.
p337
aVClose encounter four: the Algarve,
p338
aVPortugal, 1991.
p339
aVSome years later, I and this woman \u2014
p340
aVwe'll call her "Catherine Fletcher" \u2014
p341
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p342
aVwent traveling through the south of Portugal together.
p343
aVWe stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities,
p344
aVin tiny little hotels,
p345
aVand we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde
p346
aVand watch the sun set and play checkers.
p347
aVWhat? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?
p348
aVWe went to some topless beaches.
p349
aVExcuse me? No, not in my life.
p350
aVFor what it's worth, we went to Sagres,
p351
aVwhich was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.
p352
aVAnd there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,
p353
aVand the lead dog bit me on the ass,
p354
aVrequiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic
p355
aVand receive an ass shot.
p356
aVMake of that what you will.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Laughter)
p359
aa(lp360
VOur last day in Portugal,
p361
aVwe were in the district capital of Faro,
p362
aVand Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach
p363
aVone last time.
p364
aVNow, Faro is a bustling little city,
p365
aVand to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take
p366
aVa bus and then a boat.
p367
aVAnd did I want to come with?
p368
aVBut I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, "No."
p369
aVI remember what she looked like before she left.
p370
aVThe freckles had grown
p371
aVand multiplied on her face and shoulders,
p372
aVclustering into a kind of a tan.
p373
aVA tan, we were both tan \u2014
p374
aVis this true?
p375
aVHer eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.
p376
aVShe was smiling.
p377
aVShe was a single woman about to go alone into a country,
p378
aVnot even speaking the language,
p379
aVto travel alone by bus and boat
p380
aVto go to a beach she did not know
p381
aVor had never seen.
p382
aVI loved her, and then she went out
p383
aVinto that strange, alien land.
p384
aa(lp385
VIt took me some time to come to my senses.
p386
aVI had my own "lost time" moment,
p387
aVwhere I woke up and suddenly realized
p388
aVit was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,
p389
aVand she had not come back.
p390
aVNervous, I went down to the street to look for her.
p391
aVNow, I did not speak Portuguese.
p392
aVI did not know where the beach was.
p393
aVI could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,
p394
aVand the aliens had not given us that technology yet.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Laughter)
p397
aa(lp398
VI realized that the day would only have
p399
aVtwo possible outcomes:
p400
aVeither Catherine would come back to the hotel,
p401
aVor she would never come back to the hotel.
p402
aVAnd so I sat down to wait.
p403
aVI did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street
p404
aVwhere the buses and cars and pedestrians
p405
aVand little scooters were moving along.
p406
aVAnd I watched those constellations shift,
p407
aVhoping that they would part and I would see her face.
p408
aVIt was at that moment,
p409
aVin that very small town of 30,000 or so,
p410
aVthat I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe
p411
aVand the searching we might do in it.
p412
aVAnd that's when the Liberians came along.
p413
aVFive young men \u2014 all laughing, happy, traveling together,
p414
aVcoming back to this hotel where they were staying.
p415
aa(lp416
VOne of them was named Joseph, and he asked me
p417
aVwhat was I doing, and I explained.
p418
aVAnd he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe.
p419
aVBut he did not seem so very sure,
p420
aVfor he sat down to wait with me.
p421
aVAnd for the next two hours, they all waited with me:
p422
aVtaking turns, going up to their room, coming back,
p423
aVtelling me jokes, distracting me.
p424
aVTwo hours, they gave me a message.
p425
aVWe are not alone.
p426
aa(lp427
VAnd then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,
p428
aVI turned and looked down the street.
p429
aVThe stars aligned, and she came back.
p430
aVShe was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.
p431
aVNeither did the Liberians,
p432
aValthough there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter
p433
aVas they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room
p434
aVand left us alone in the street, holding hands.
p435
aVAn event like this leaves a scar on the memory,
p436
aVmuch like a piece of alien technology
p437
aVthat has been inserted into your buttocks
p438
aVby a "Portuguese doctor."
p439
aa(lp440
V(Laughter)
p441
aa(lp442
VAnd even now, a decade and a half later,
p443
aVeven now that we are married,
p444
aVI look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.
p445
aVAnd even though, I think you'll agree, it is probable
p446
aVthat during the time she was away,
p447
aVshe was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,
p448
aVI love her and wait for her still.
p449
aa(lp450
VThank you for your kind attention.
p451
aa(lp452
V(Applause)

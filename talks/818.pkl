V"People do stupid things.
p5
aVThat's what spreads HIV."
p6
aVThis was a headline in a U.K. newspaper,
p7
aVThe Guardian, not that long ago.
p8
aVI'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?
p9
aVWell, one or two brave souls.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist
p12
aVwho's been in field of HIV for 15 years,
p13
aVworked on four continents,
p14
aVand you're looking at her.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd I am now going to argue
p17
aVthat this is only half true.
p18
aVPeople do get HIV because they do stupid things,
p19
aVbut most of them are doing stupid things
p20
aVfor perfectly rational reasons.
p21
aVNow, "rational" is the dominant paradigm
p22
aVin public health,
p23
aVand if you put your public health nerd glasses on,
p24
aVyou'll see that if we give people the information that they need
p25
aVabout what's good for them and what's bad for them,
p26
aVif you give them the services
p27
aVthat they can use to act on that information,
p28
aVand a little bit of motivation,
p29
aVpeople will make rational decisions
p30
aVand live long and healthy lives.
p31
aVWonderful.
p32
aa(lp33
VThat's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV,
p34
aVand although I'm sure you all know
p35
aVthat HIV is about poverty and gender inequality,
p36
aVand if you were at TED '07
p37
aVit's about coffee prices ...
p38
aVActually, HIV's about sex and drugs,
p39
aVand if there are two things that make
p40
aVhuman beings a little bit irrational,
p41
aVthey are erections and addiction.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, let's start with what's rational for an addict.
p46
aVNow, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.
p47
aVWe were having lunch and he was telling me
p48
aVabout when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.
p49
aVIt was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly
p50
aVsmuggled some heroin into jail,
p51
aVand he was very generously sharing it out
p52
aVwith all of his colleagues.
p53
aVAnd so everyone lined up,
p54
aVall the smackheads in a row,
p55
aVand the guy whose birthday it was
p56
aVfilled up the fit,
p57
aVand he went down and started injecting people.
p58
aVSo he injects the first guy,
p59
aVand then he's wiping the needle on his shirt,
p60
aVand he injects the next guy.
p61
aVAnd Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line,
p62
aVand I can see the needle coming down towards me,
p63
aVand there is blood all over the place.
p64
aVIt's getting blunter and blunter.
p65
aVAnd a small part of my brain is thinking,
p66
aV'That is so gross
p67
aVand really dangerous,'
p68
aVbut most of my brain is thinking,
p69
aV'Please let there be some smack left
p70
aVby the time it gets to me.
p71
aVPlease let there be some left.'"
p72
aVAnd then, telling me this story,
p73
aVFrankie said,
p74
aV"You know ... God,
p75
aVdrugs really make you stupid."
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.
p78
aVBut, actually, Frankie, at that time,
p79
aVwas a heroin addict and he was in jail.
p80
aVSo his choice was either
p81
aVto accept that dirty needle or not to get high.
p82
aVAnd if there's one place you really want to get high,
p83
aVit's when you're in jail.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut I'm a scientist
p86
aVand I don't like to make data out of anecdotes,
p87
aVso let's look at some data.
p88
aVWe talked to 600 drug addicts
p89
aVin three cities in Indonesia,
p90
aVand we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?"
p91
aV"Oh yeah, by sharing needles."
p92
aVI mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.
p93
aVAnd, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle
p94
aVat a price you can afford to avoid that?"
p95
aV"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.
p96
aV"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles."
p97
aV"So are you carrying a needle?"
p98
aVWe're actually interviewing people on the street,
p99
aVin the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.
p100
aV"Are you carrying clean needles?"
p101
aVOne in four, maximum.
p102
aVSo no surprises then that
p103
aVthe proportion that actually used clean needles
p104
aVevery time they injected in the last week
p105
aVis just about one in 10,
p106
aVand the other nine in 10 are sharing.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo you've got this massive mismatch;
p109
aVeveryone knows that
p110
aVif they share they're going to get HIV,
p111
aVbut they're all sharing anyway.
p112
aVSo what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?
p113
aVWe asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?"
p114
aVYou don't want to share a needle anymore than you want
p115
aVto share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.
p116
aVThere's just kind of an ick factor there.
p117
aV"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."
p118
aVSo, in Indonesia at this time,
p119
aVif you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up,
p120
aVthey could put you into jail.
p121
aVAnd that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?
p122
aVBecause your choice now is either
p123
aVI use my own needle now,
p124
aVor I could share a needle now
p125
aVand get a disease that's going to
p126
aVpossibly kill me 10 years from now,
p127
aVor I could use my own needle now
p128
aVand go to jail tomorrow.
p129
aVAnd while junkies think that
p130
aVit's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV,
p131
aVthey think it's a much worse idea
p132
aVto spend the next year in jail
p133
aVwhere they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation
p134
aVand expose themselves to HIV anyway.
p135
aVSo, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational
p136
aVto share needles.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.
p139
aVThis is a really easy problem.
p140
aVFor once, your incentives are aligned.
p141
aVWe've got what's rational for public health.
p142
aVYou want people to use clean needles \u2014
p143
aVand junkies want to use clean needles.
p144
aVSo we could make this problem go away
p145
aVsimply by making clean needles universally available
p146
aVand taking away the fear of arrest.
p147
aVNow, the first person to figure that out
p148
aVand do something about it on a national scale
p149
aVwas that well-known, bleeding heart liberal
p150
aVMargaret Thatcher.
p151
aVAnd she put in the world's first
p152
aVnational needle exchange program,
p153
aVand other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.
p154
aVAnd in all of those countries, you can see,
p155
aVnot more than four percent of injectors
p156
aVever became infected with HIV.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, places that didn't do this \u2014 New York City for example,
p159
aVMoscow, Jakarta \u2014
p160
aVwe're talking, at its peak,
p161
aVone in two injectors
p162
aVinfected with this fatal disease.
p163
aVNow, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this
p164
aVbecause she has any great love for junkies.
p165
aVShe did it because she ran a country
p166
aVthat had a national health service.
p167
aVSo, if she didn't invest in effective prevention,
p168
aVshe was going to have pick up the costs
p169
aVof treatment later on,
p170
aVand obviously those are much higher.
p171
aVSo she was making a politically rational decision.
p172
aVNow, if I take out my
p173
aVpublic health nerd glasses here
p174
aVand look at these data,
p175
aVit seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?
p176
aVBut in this country,
p177
aVwhere the government apparently does not feel compelled
p178
aVto provide health care for citizens, (Laughter)
p179
aVwe've taken a very different approach.
p180
aVSo what we've been doing in the United States
p181
aVis reviewing the data \u2014 endlessly reviewing the data.
p182
aVSo, these are reviews of hundreds of studies
p183
aVby all the big muckety-mucks
p184
aVof the scientific pantheon in the United States,
p185
aVand these are the studies that show
p186
aVneedle programs are effective \u2014 quite a lot of them.
p187
aVNow, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective \u2014
p188
aVyou think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides
p189
aVand I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up,
p190
aVbut no \u2014 that's the whole slide.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VThere is nothing on the other side.
p195
aVSo, completely irrational,
p196
aVyou would think.
p197
aVExcept that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too,
p198
aVand they're responding to what they think the voters want.
p199
aVSo what we see is that voters respond
p200
aVvery well to things like this
p201
aVand not quite so well to things like this.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VSo it becomes quite rational
p206
aVto deny services to injectors.
p207
aVNow let's talk about sex.
p208
aVAre we any more rational about sex?
p209
aVWell, I'm not even going to address
p210
aVthe clearly irrational positions
p211
aVof people like the Catholic Church,
p212
aVwho think somehow that if you give out condoms,
p213
aVeveryone's going to run out and have sex.
p214
aVI don't know if Pope Benedict
p215
aVwatches TEDTalks online,
p216
aVbut if you do, I've got news for you Benedict \u2014
p217
aVI carry condoms all the time
p218
aVand I never get laid.
p219
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p220
aVIt's not that easy!
p221
aVHere, maybe you'll have better luck.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VOkay, seriously,
p226
aVHIV is actually not that easy
p227
aVto transmit sexually.
p228
aVSo, it depends on how much virus there is
p229
aVin your blood and in your body fluids.
p230
aVAnd what we've got is a very, very high level of virus
p231
aVright at the beginning when you're first infected,
p232
aVthen you start making antibodies,
p233
aVand then it bumps along at quite low levels
p234
aVfor a long time \u2014 10 or 12 years \u2014
p235
aVyou have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.
p236
aVBut basically, nothing much is going on
p237
aVuntil you start to get symptomatic AIDS,
p238
aVand by that stage,
p239
aVyou're not looking great, you're not feeling great,
p240
aVyou're not having that much sex.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo the sexual transmission of HIV
p243
aVis essentially determined by how many partners you have
p244
aVin these very short spaces of time
p245
aVwhen you have peak viremia.
p246
aVNow, this makes people crazy
p247
aVbecause it means that you have to talk about
p248
aVsome groups having more sexual partners
p249
aVin shorter spaces of time than other groups,
p250
aVand that's considered stigmatizing.
p251
aVI've always been a bit curious about that
p252
aVbecause I think stigma is a bad thing,
p253
aVwhereas lots of sex is quite a good thing,
p254
aVbut we'll leave that be.
p255
aVThe truth is that 20 years
p256
aVof very good research
p257
aVhave shown us that
p258
aVthere are groups that are more likely to turnover
p259
aVlarge numbers of partners in a short space of time.
p260
aVAnd those groups are, globally,
p261
aVpeople who sell sex and their more regular partners.
p262
aVThey are gay men on the party scene
p263
aVwho have, on average, three times more partners
p264
aVthan straight people on the party scene.
p265
aVAnd they are heterosexuals
p266
aVwho come from countries that have
p267
aVtraditions of polygamy
p268
aVand relatively high levels of female autonomy,
p269
aVand almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.
p270
aVAnd that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.
p271
aa(lp272
VYou can see these horrifying figures from Africa.
p273
aVThese are all countries in southern Africa
p274
aVwhere between one in seven,
p275
aVand one in three
p276
aVof all adults,
p277
aVare infected with HIV.
p278
aVNow, in the rest of the world,
p279
aVwe've got basically nothing going on in the general population \u2014
p280
aVvery, very low levels \u2014
p281
aVbut we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV
p282
aVin these other populations who are at highest risk:
p283
aVdrug injectors, sex workers
p284
aVand gay men.
p285
aVAnd you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles:
p286
aV25 percent prevalence among gay men.
p287
aVOf course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.
p288
aVYou can only HIV by having unprotected sex
p289
aVwith a positive person.
p290
aa(lp291
VIn most of the world,
p292
aVthese few prevention failures
p293
aVnotwithstanding,
p294
aVwe are actually doing quite well these days
p295
aVin commercial sex:
p296
aVcondom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent
p297
aVin commercial sex in most countries.
p298
aVAnd, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.
p299
aVWhat's rational for public health
p300
aVis also rational for individual sex workers
p301
aVbecause it's really bad for business to have another STI.
p302
aVNo one wants it.
p303
aVAnd, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.
p304
aVSo essentially, you're able to achieve
p305
aVquite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.
p306
aa(lp307
VBut in "intimate" relations
p308
aVit's much more difficult because,
p309
aVwith your wife or your boyfriend
p310
aVor someone that you hope might turn into one of those things,
p311
aVwe have this illusion of romance
p312
aVand trust and intimacy,
p313
aVand nothing is quite so unromantic
p314
aVas the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.
p315
aVSo in the face of that,
p316
aVyou really need quite a strong incentive
p317
aVto use condoms.
p318
aa(lp319
VThis, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.
p320
aVHe's from Haiti and he has AIDS.
p321
aVAnd he's probably not having a lot of sex right now,
p322
aVbut he is a reminder in the population,
p323
aVof why you might want to be
p324
aVusing condoms.
p325
aVThis is also in Haiti and is a reminder
p326
aVof why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.
p327
aVNow, funnily enough, this is also Joseph
p328
aVafter six months on antiretroviral treatment.
p329
aVNot for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.
p330
aVBut it is changing the equation
p331
aVof what's rational
p332
aVin sexual decision-making.
p333
aVSo, what we've got \u2014
p334
aVsome people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much
p335
aVbecause, actually, treatment is effective prevention
p336
aVbecause it lowers your viral load and therefore
p337
aVmakes it more difficult to transmit HIV."
p338
aVSo, if you look at the viremia thing again,
p339
aVif you do start treatment when you're sick,
p340
aVwell, what happens? Your viral load comes down.
p341
aVBut compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?
p342
aVWell, you die,
p343
aVso your viral load goes to zero.
p344
aVAnd all of this green stuff here, including the spikes \u2014
p345
aVwhich are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy,
p346
aVor you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge
p347
aVand forgot to take your drugs,
p348
aVor because you've started to get resistance, or whatever \u2014
p349
aVall of that is virus
p350
aVthat wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.
p351
aa(lp352
VNow, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.
p353
aVLet's just stop treating people."
p354
aVOf course not, of course not.
p355
aVWe need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.
p356
aVBut what I am doing is calling into question
p357
aVthose people who say that more treatment
p358
aVis all the prevention we need.
p359
aVThat's simply not necessarily true,
p360
aVand I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men
p361
aVin rich countries where treatment has been widely available
p362
aVfor going on 15 years now.
p363
aVAnd what we've seen is
p364
aVthat, actually, condom use rates,
p365
aVwhich were very, very high \u2014
p366
aVthe gay community responded very rapidly to HIV,
p367
aVwith extremely little help
p368
aVfrom public health nerds, I would say \u2014
p369
aVthat condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment
p370
aVfor two reasons really:
p371
aVOne is the assumption of, "Oh well,
p372
aVif he's infected, he's probably on meds,
p373
aVand his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."
p374
aa(lp375
VAnd the other thing is that people are simply
p376
aVnot as scared of HIV
p377
aVas they were of AIDS, and rightly so.
p378
aVAIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you,
p379
aVand HIV is an invisible virus
p380
aVthat makes you take a pill every day.
p381
aVAnd that's boring,
p382
aVbut is it as boring as
p383
aVhaving to use a condom every time you have sex,
p384
aVno matter how drunk you are,
p385
aVno matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?
p386
aVIf we look at the data, we can see that
p387
aVthe answer to that question
p388
aVis, mmm.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo these are data from Scotland.
p391
aVYou see the peak in drug injectors
p392
aVbefore they started the national needle exchange program.
p393
aVThen it came way down.
p394
aVAnd both in heterosexuals \u2014 mostly in commercial sex \u2014
p395
aVand in drug users,
p396
aVyou've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins,
p397
aVand that's because of that alignment of incentives
p398
aVthat I talked about earlier.
p399
aVBut in gay men,
p400
aVyou've got quite a dramatic rise
p401
aVstarting three or four years
p402
aVafter treatment became widely available.
p403
aVThis is of new infections.
p404
aa(lp405
VWhat does that mean?
p406
aVIt means that the combined effect of being less worried
p407
aVand having more virus out there in the population \u2014
p408
aVmore people living longer, healthier lives,
p409
aVmore likely to be getting laid
p410
aVwith HIV \u2014
p411
aVis outweighing the effects of lower viral load,
p412
aVand that's a very worrisome thing.
p413
aVWhat does it mean?
p414
aVIt means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.
p415
aa(lp416
VIs that what's happening?
p417
aVNo, and I call it the "compassion conundrum."
p418
aVWe've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days,
p419
aVand what's happening really is that people are
p420
aVunable quite to bring themselves to put in
p421
aVgood sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers,
p422
aVunable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.
p423
aVBut once they've gone from being
p424
aVtransgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone
p425
aVto being AIDS victims,
p426
aVwe come over all compassionate
p427
aVand buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.
p428
aVIt doesn't make any sense
p429
aVfrom a public health point of view.
p430
aa(lp431
VI want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.
p432
aVInes is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta;
p433
aVshe's a chick with a dick.
p434
aVWhy does she do that job?
p435
aVWell, of course, because she's forced into it
p436
aVbecause she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.
p437
aVAnd if we could just teach her to sew
p438
aVand get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.
p439
aVThis is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia:
p440
aVon average, 20 cents.
p441
aVIt varies a bit province to province.
p442
aVI do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them
p443
aVfor this particular slide,
p444
aVand this is what sex workers
p445
aVsay they earn in an hour.
p446
aVSo it's not a great job, but for a lot of people
p447
aVit really is quite a rational choice.
p448
aVOkay, Ines.
p449
aa(lp450
VWe've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash,
p451
aVand commitment to preventing HIV too.
p452
aa(lp453
VInes: So why is prevalence still rising?
p454
aVIt's all politics.
p455
aVWhen you get to politics, nothing makes sense.
p456
aa(lp457
VElizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense."
p458
aVSo, from the point of view of a sex worker,
p459
aVpoliticians are making no sense.
p460
aVFrom the point of view of a public health nerd,
p461
aVjunkies are doing dumb things.
p462
aVThe truth is that everyone has a different rationale.
p463
aVThere are as many different ways of being rational
p464
aVas there are human beings on the planet,
p465
aVand that's one of the glories of human existence.
p466
aVBut those ways of being rational
p467
aVare not independent of one another,
p468
aVso it's rational for
p469
aVa drug injector to share needles
p470
aVbecause of a stupid decision that's made by a politician,
p471
aVand it's rational for a politician
p472
aVto make that stupid decision
p473
aVbecause they're responding to
p474
aVwhat they think the voters want.
p475
aVBut here's the thing:
p476
aVwe are the voters.
p477
aVWe're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.
p478
aVAnd everyone who's in this room,
p479
aVand everyone who's watching this out there on the web,
p480
aVI think, has a duty to demand of their politicians
p481
aVthat we make policy based on scientific evidence
p482
aVand on common sense.
p483
aVIt's going to be really hard for us
p484
aVto individually affect what's rational
p485
aVfor every Frankie and every Ines out there,
p486
aVbut you can at least use your vote
p487
aVto stop politicians doing stupid things
p488
aVthat spread HIV.

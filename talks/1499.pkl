VIn the ocean,
p5
aVwhat is the common point
p6
aVbetween oil, plastic and radioactivity?
p7
aa(lp8
VOn the top line, this is the BP oil spill:
p9
aVbillions of barrels of oil gushing
p10
aVin the Gulf of Mexico.
p11
aVThe middle line is millions of tons of
p12
aVplastic debris accumulating in our ocean,
p13
aVand the third line is radioactive material
p14
aVleaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant
p15
aVin the Pacific Ocean.
p16
aa(lp17
VWell, the three big problems have in common
p18
aVthat they are man-made problems
p19
aVbut they are controlled by natural forces.
p20
aVThis should make us feel very, terribly awful
p21
aVas much as it should make us feel hopeful,
p22
aVbecause if we have the power to create these problems,
p23
aVwe may as well have the power
p24
aVto remediate these problems.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut what about natural forces?
p27
aVWell, that's exactly what I want to talk about today,
p28
aVis how we can use these natural forces
p29
aVto remediate these man-made problems.
p30
aVWhen the BP oil spill happened,
p31
aa(lp32
VI was working at MIT, and I was in charge
p33
aVof developing an oil spill-cleaning technology.
p34
aVAnd I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico
p35
aVand meet some fishermen and see
p36
aVthe terrible conditions in which they were working.
p37
aVMore than 700 of these boats,
p38
aVwhich are fishermen boats repurposed
p39
aVwith oil absorbent in white
p40
aVand oil containment in orange, were used,
p41
aVbut they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface,
p42
aVand the health of the cleaners
p43
aVwere very deeply affected.
p44
aa(lp45
VI was working on a very interesting technology
p46
aVat MIT, but it was a very long-term view
p47
aVof how to develop technology,
p48
aVand it was going to be a very expensive technology,
p49
aVand also it would be patented.
p50
aVSo I wanted to develop something that we could
p51
aVdevelop very fast, that would be cheap,
p52
aVand that would be open-source, so, because
p53
aVoil spills are not only happening in the Gulf of Mexico,
p54
aVand that would be using renewable energy.
p55
aVSo I quit my dream job,
p56
aVand I moved to New Orleans,
p57
aVand I kept on studying how the oil spill was happening.
p58
aa(lp59
VCurrently, what they were doing is
p60
aVthat they were using these small fishing boats,
p61
aVand they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt.
p62
aVIf you're using the exact same amount of surface
p63
aVof oil absorbent, but you're just paying attention
p64
aVto natural patterns, and if you're going up the winds,
p65
aVyou can collect a lot more material.
p66
aVIf you're multiplying the rig,
p67
aVso you multiply how many layers of absorbent
p68
aVyou're using, you can collect a lot more.
p69
aVBut it's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent
p70
aVagainst the winds, the surface currents and the waves.
p71
aVThese are enormous forces.
p72
aVSo the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique
p73
aVof sailing and tacking of the wind
p74
aVto capture or intercept the oil
p75
aVthat is drifting down the wind.
p76
aVSo this didn't require any invention.
p77
aVWe just took a simple sailing boat
p78
aVand we tried to pull something long and heavy,
p79
aVbut as we tacked back and forth,
p80
aVwhat we lost was two things:
p81
aVwe were losing pulling power and direction.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder
p84
aVfrom the back of the boat to the front,
p85
aVwould we have better control?
p86
aVSo I built this small sailing robot
p87
aVwith the rudder at the front,
p88
aVand I was trying to pull something very long and heavy,
p89
aVso that's a four-meter-long object just to pull,
p90
aVand I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder,
p91
aVI could control four meters of absorbent.
p92
aVThen I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot,
p93
aVand so you see the robot has
p94
aVa front rudder here.
p95
aVNormally it's at the back.
p96
aVAnd, playing, I realized that the maneuverability
p97
aVof this was really amazing,
p98
aVand I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second,
p99
aVmore maneuverable than a normal boat.
p100
aa(lp101
VThen I started publishing online, and
p102
aVsome friends from Korea, they started being
p103
aVinterested in this, and we made a boat
p104
aVwhich has a front rudder and a back rudder,
p105
aVso we started interacting with this,
p106
aVand it was slightly better,
p107
aValthough it was very small and a bit off balance,
p108
aVbut then we thought,
p109
aVwhat if we have more than two points of control?
p110
aVWhat if the entire boat becomes a point of control?
p111
aVWhat if the entire boat changes shape?
p112
aa(lp113
VSo \u2014 (Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VThank you very much. (Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd so that's the beginning of Protei,
p118
aVand that's the first boat in history
p119
aVthat completely changed the shape of the hull
p120
aVin order to control it,
p121
aVand the properties of sailing that we get
p122
aVare very superior compared to a normal boat.
p123
aVWhen we're turning, we have the feeling of surfing,
p124
aVand the way it's going up-wind, it's very efficient.
p125
aVThis is low speed, low wind speed,
p126
aVand the maneuverability is very increased,
p127
aVand here I'm going to do a small jibe,
p128
aVand look at the position of the sail.
p129
aVWhat's happening is that, because the boat changes shape,
p130
aVthe position of the front sail and the main sail
p131
aVare different to the wind.
p132
aVWe're catching wind from both sides.
p133
aVAnd this is exactly what we're looking [for]
p134
aVif we want to pull something long and heavy.
p135
aVWe don't want to lose pulling power, nor direction.
p136
aVSo, I wanted to know if this was possible
p137
aVto put this at an industrial level,
p138
aVso we made a large boat with a large sail,
p139
aVand with a very light hull, inflatable,
p140
aVvery small footprint,
p141
aVso we have a very big size and power ratio.
p142
aa(lp143
VAfter this, we wanted to see if we could
p144
aVimplement this and automate the system,
p145
aVso we used the same system but we added
p146
aVa structure to it so we could activate the machine.
p147
aVSo, we used the same bladder-inflated system,
p148
aVand we took it for testing.
p149
aVSo this is happening in the Netherlands.
p150
aVWe tried in the water without any skin or ballast
p151
aVjust to see how it works.
p152
aVAnd then we mounted a camera for controlling it,
p153
aVbut quickly we saw that we would need
p154
aVa lot more weight at the bottom,
p155
aVso we had to take it back to the lab,
p156
aVand then we built a skin around it,
p157
aVwe put batteries, remote controllers, and then
p158
aVwe put it in the water and then we
p159
aVlet it go in the water and see how well it would work,
p160
aVso let some rope out, and hope it's going to work,
p161
aVand it worked okay, but we still have a long way.
p162
aVOur small prototype has given us good insight
p163
aVthat it's working very well,
p164
aVbut we still need to work a lot more on this.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo what we are doing is an accelerated evolution
p167
aVof sailing technology.
p168
aVWe went from a back rudder to a front rudder
p169
aVto two rudders to multiple rudders
p170
aVto the whole boat changing shape,
p171
aVand the more we are moving forward,
p172
aVand the more the design looks simple and cute. (Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VBut I wanted to show you a fish because \u2014
p175
aVIn fact, it's very different from a fish.
p176
aVA fish will move because \u2014 by changing like this,
p177
aVbut our boat is propelled by the wind still,
p178
aVand the hull controls the trajectory.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage
p181
aVProtei Number Eight. It's not the last one,
p182
aVbut it's a good one for making demos.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo the first thing as I show you in the video is
p185
aVthat we may be able to control the trajectory
p186
aVof a sailing boat better,
p187
aVor we may be able to never be in irons,
p188
aVso never facing the wind,
p189
aVwe always can catch the wind from both sides.
p190
aVBut new properties of a sailing boat.
p191
aVSo if you're looking at the boat from this side,
p192
aVthis might remind you of an airplane profile.
p193
aVAn airplane, when you're moving in this direction,
p194
aVstarts to lift, and that's how it takes off.
p195
aVNow, if you're taking the same system,
p196
aVand you're putting vertical, you're bending,
p197
aVand if you're moving this way forward,
p198
aVyour instinct will tell you that you might go this way,
p199
aVbut if you're moving fast enough,
p200
aVyou might create what we call lateral lift,
p201
aVso we could get further or closer to the wind.
p202
aa(lp203
VOther property is this:
p204
aVA normal sailing boat has a centerboard here
p205
aVand a rudder at the back,
p206
aVand these two things are what creates most
p207
aVresistance and turbulence behind the boat,
p208
aVbut because this doesn't have either
p209
aVa centerboard or a rudder,
p210
aVwe hope that if we keep working on this hull design
p211
aVwe can improve and have less resistance.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe other thing is, most boats, when they reach
p214
aVa certain speed, and they are going on waves,
p215
aVthey start to hit and slap on the surface of the water,
p216
aVand a lot of the energy moving forward is lost.
p217
aVBut if we're going with the flow,
p218
aVif we pay attention to natural patterns
p219
aVinstead of trying to be strong,
p220
aVbut if you're going with the flow, we may absorb
p221
aVa lot of environmental noises, so the wave energy,
p222
aVto actually save some energy to move forward.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo we may have developed the technology
p225
aVwhich is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy,
p226
aVbut the idea is, what is the purpose of technology
p227
aVif it doesn't reach the right hands?
p228
aa(lp229
VNormal technology or innovation happens like this:
p230
aVSomebody has an interesting idea,
p231
aVsome other scientist or engineer,
p232
aVthey take it to the next level, they make a theory about it
p233
aVand maybe they patent it,
p234
aVand then some industry will make a contract
p235
aVof exclusivity to manufacture and sell it,
p236
aVand then, eventually, a buyer will buy it,
p237
aVand we hope that they are going to use [it] for a good purpose.
p238
aVWhat we really want is that this innovation happens
p239
aVcontinuously. The inventor and engineers
p240
aVand also the manufacturers and everybody
p241
aVworks at the same time, but this would be sterile
p242
aVif this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process.
p243
aVWhat you really want is not a sequential,
p244
aVnot parallel development.
p245
aVYou want to have a network of innovation.
p246
aVYou want everybody, like we're doing now,
p247
aVto work at the same time, and that can only happen
p248
aVif these people all together decide to share the information,
p249
aVand that's exactly what open hardware is about.
p250
aVIt's to replace competition by collaboration.
p251
aVIt's to transform any new product into a new market.
p252
aVSo what is open hardware?
p253
aVEssentially, open hardware is a license.
p254
aVIt's just an intellectual property setup.
p255
aVIt means that everybody is free to use,
p256
aVmodify and distribute, and in exchange
p257
aVwe only ask for two things:
p258
aVThe name is credited \u2014 the name of the project \u2014
p259
aVand also the people who make improvement,
p260
aVthey share back with the community.
p261
aVSo it's a very simple condition.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans,
p264
aVbut quickly after I wanted to publish and share
p265
aVthis information, so I made a Kickstarter,
p266
aVwhich is a crowd-fundraising platform,
p267
aVand in about one month we fundraised 30,000 dollars.
p268
aVWith this money, I hired a team of young engineers
p269
aVfrom all over the world, and we rented a factory
p270
aVin Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
p271
aVWe were peer-learning, we were engineering,
p272
aVwe were making things, prototyping,
p273
aVbut most importantly we were trying our prototypes
p274
aVin the water as often as possible,
p275
aVto fail as quickly as possible, to learn from.
p276
aVThis is a proud member of Protei from Korea,
p277
aVand on the right side, this is a multiple-masts
p278
aVdesign proposed by a team in Mexico.
p279
aVThis idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine
p280
aVin New York, and so she decided to prototype
p281
aVthis idea that she saw, and she documented
p282
aVevery step of the process,
p283
aVand she published it on Instructables,
p284
aVwhich is a website for sharing inventions.
p285
aVLess than one week after,
p286
aVthis is a team in Eindhoven, it's a school of engineering.
p287
aVThey made it, but they eventually published
p288
aVa simplified design.
p289
aVThey also made it into an Instructable,
p290
aVand in less than one week, they had
p291
aValmost 10,000 views, and they got many new friends.
p292
aVWe're working on also simpler technology,
p293
aVnot that complex, with younger people
p294
aVand also older people,
p295
aVlike this dinosaur is from Mexico. (Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VSo Protei is now an international network
p298
aVof innovation for selling technology
p299
aVusing this shape-shifting hull.
p300
aVAnd what puts us together is that we have a common,
p301
aVat least, global understanding
p302
aVof what the word "business" is, or what it should be.
p303
aVThis is how most work today.
p304
aVBusiness as usual is saying, what's most important
p305
aVis to make lots of profit, and you'll be using
p306
aVtechnology for that, and people will be your work force,
p307
aVinstrumentalized,
p308
aVand environment is usually the last priority.
p309
aVIt will be just a way to, say, greenwash your audience
p310
aVand, say, increase your price tag.
p311
aa(lp312
VWhat we're trying to do, or what we believe,
p313
aVbecause this is how we believe the world really works,
p314
aVis that without the environment you have nothing.
p315
aVWe have the people so we need to protect each other, yes,
p316
aVand we're a technology company,
p317
aVand profit is necessary to make this happen. (Applause)
p318
aa(lp319
VThank you very much. (Applause)
p320
aa(lp321
VIf we have the courage to understand or accept
p322
aVthat this actually how the world really works,
p323
aVand this is the order of priority that we need to choose,
p324
aVthen it makes obvious why we need
p325
aVto choose open hardware for developing environmental
p326
aVtechnology, because we need to share information.
p327
aa(lp328
VWhat's next for us?
p329
aa(lp330
VSo, this small machine that you've seen,
p331
aVwe're hoping to make small toys like
p332
aVone-meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade \u2014
p333
aVso replace the remote control parts by Androids,
p334
aVso the mobile phone, and Arduino micro-controller,
p335
aVso you could be controlling this
p336
aVfrom your mobile phone, your tablet.
p337
aVThen what we want to do is create six-meter versions
p338
aVso we can test the maximum performance of these machines,
p339
aVso we can go at very, very high speed.
p340
aVSo imagine yourself.
p341
aVYou are laying down in a flexible torpedo,
p342
aVsailing at high speed,
p343
aVcontrolling the shape of the hull with your legs
p344
aVand controlling the sail with your arms.
p345
aVSo that's what we're looking for developing. (Applause)
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd we replace the human being \u2014
p348
aVto go, for example, for measuring radioactivity,
p349
aVyou don't want a human to be sailing those robots \u2014
p350
aVwith batteries, motors, micro-controllers and sensors.
p351
aVThis is what our teammates, we dream of at night.
p352
aVWe hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills,
p353
aVor we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean,
p354
aVor we can have swarms of our machines
p355
aVcontrolled by multi-player video game engines
p356
aVto control many of these machines,
p357
aVto monitor coral reefs
p358
aVor to monitor fisheries.
p359
aa(lp360
VOur hope is that we can use open hardware technology
p361
aVto better understand and protect our oceans.
p362
aa(lp363
VThank you very much. (Applause)

VWell we all know the World Wide Web
p5
aVhas absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting,
p6
aVcommerce and social connectivity,
p7
aVbut where did it all come from?
p8
aVAnd I'll quote three people:
p9
aVVannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.
p10
aVSo let's just run through these guys.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is Vannevar Bush.
p13
aVVannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war.
p14
aVAnd in 1945,
p15
aVhe published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly.
p16
aVAnd the article was called "As We May Think."
p17
aVAnd what Vannevar Bush was saying
p18
aVwas the way we use information is broken.
p19
aVWe don't work in terms of libraries
p20
aVand catalog systems and so forth.
p21
aVThe brain works by association.
p22
aVWith one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.
p23
aVAnd the way information is structured
p24
aVis totally incapable of keeping up with this process.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd so he suggested a machine,
p27
aVand he called it the memex.
p28
aVAnd the memex would link information,
p29
aVone piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth.
p30
aVNow this was in 1945.
p31
aVA computer in those days
p32
aVwas something the secret services used to use for code breaking.
p33
aVAnd nobody knew anything about it.
p34
aVSo this was before the computer was invented.
p35
aVAnd he proposed this machine called the memex.
p36
aVAnd he had a platform where you linked information to other information,
p37
aVand then you could call it up at will.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo spinning forward,
p40
aVone of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart,
p41
aVand he was a U.S. Air Force officer.
p42
aVAnd he was reading it in their library in the Far East.
p43
aVAnd he was so inspired by this article,
p44
aVit kind of directed the rest of his life.
p45
aVAnd by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into action
p46
aVwhen he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California.
p47
aVHe built a system.
p48
aVThe system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called.
p49
aVAnd in a premonition of today's world
p50
aVof cloud computing and softwares of service,
p51
aVhis system was called NLS
p52
aVfor oN-Line System.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd this is Doug Engelbart.
p55
aVHe was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference
p56
aVin 1968.
p57
aVWhat he showed \u2014
p58
aVhe sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.
p59
aVHe had his head mic like I've got.
p60
aVAnd he works this system.
p61
aVAnd you can see, he's working between documents
p62
aVand graphics and so forth.
p63
aVAnd he's driving it all
p64
aVwith this platform here,
p65
aVwith a five-finger keyboard
p66
aVand the world's first computer mouse,
p67
aVwhich he specially designed in order to do this system.
p68
aVSo this is where the mouse came from as well.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo this is Doug Engelbart.
p71
aVThe trouble with Doug Engelbart's system
p72
aVwas that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.
p73
aVSo for a personal computer,
p74
aVa few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane;
p75
aVit wasn't really very practical.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut spin on to the 80s
p78
aVwhen personal computers did arrive,
p79
aVthen there was room for this kind of system on personal computers.
p80
aVAnd my company, OWL
p81
aVbuilt a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.
p82
aVAnd we delivered the world's first hypertext system.
p83
aVAnd this began to get a head of steam.
p84
aVApple introduced a thing called HyperCard,
p85
aVand they made a bit of a fuss about it.
p86
aVThey had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.
p87
aVThe magazines started to cover it.
p88
aVByte magazine and Communications at the ACM
p89
aVhad special issues covering hypertext.
p90
aVWe developed a PC version of this product
p91
aVas well as the Macintosh version.
p92
aVAnd our PC version became quite mature.
p93
aa(lp94
VThese are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.
p95
aVYou were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.
p96
aVWe developed a system such
p97
aVthat it had a markup language based on html.
p98
aVWe called it hml: hypertext markup language.
p99
aVAnd the system was capable of doing
p100
aVvery, very large documentation systems over computer networks.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris
p103
aVin late November 1990.
p104
aVAnd I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee
p105
aVwho said, "Are you Ian Ritchie?" and I said, "Yeah."
p106
aVAnd he said, "I need to talk to you."
p107
aVAnd he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web.
p108
aVAnd I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name,
p109
aVespecially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office.
p110
aVBut he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web
p111
aVwould take over the world one day.
p112
aVAnd he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it,
p113
aVbecause his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything;
p114
aVit was just plain text.
p115
aVI thought, well, you know, interesting,
p116
aVbut a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this.
p117
aVSo we didn't do it.
p118
aa(lp119
VIn the next couple of years,
p120
aVthe hypertext community didn't recognize him either.
p121
aVIn 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference.
p122
aVIn 1993,
p123
aVthere was a table at the conference in Seattle,
p124
aVand a guy called Marc Andreessen
p125
aVwas demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.
p126
aVAnd I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.
p127
aVAnd the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh,
p128
aVand I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo that puts me in pretty illustrious company.
p131
aVThere was a guy called Dick Rowe
p132
aVwho was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles.
p133
aVThere was a guy called Gary Kildall
p134
aVwho went flying his plane
p135
aVwhen IBM came looking for an operating system
p136
aVfor the IBM PC,
p137
aVand he wasn't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.
p138
aVAnd the 12 publishers
p139
aVwho turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess.
p140
aa(lp141
VOn the other hand, there's Marc Andreessen
p142
aVwho wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web.
p143
aVAnd according to Fortune magazine,
p144
aVhe's worth 700 million dollars.
p145
aVBut is he happy?
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)

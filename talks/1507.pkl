VSomething happened in the early morning hours
p5
aVof May 2nd, 2000, that had a profound effect
p6
aVon the way our society operates.
p7
aVIronically, hardly anyone noticed at the time.
p8
aVThe change was silent, imperceptible,
p9
aVunless you knew exactly what to look for.
p10
aVOn that morning, U.S. President Bill Clinton
p11
aVordered that a special switch be thrown
p12
aVin the orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System.
p13
aVInstantaneously, every civilian GPS receiver
p14
aVaround the globe went from errors the size of a football field
p15
aVto errors the size of a small room.
p16
aa(lp17
VIt's hard to overstate the effect that this change
p18
aVin accuracy has had on us.
p19
aVBefore this switch was thrown, we didn't have
p20
aVin-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn
p21
aVdirections, because back then, GPS couldn't tell you
p22
aVwhat block you were on, let alone what street.
p23
aa(lp24
VFor geolocation, accuracy matters,
p25
aVand things have only improved over the last 10 years.
p26
aVWith more base stations, more ground stations,
p27
aVbetter receivers and better algorithms,
p28
aVGPS can now not only tell you what street you are on,
p29
aVbut what part of the street.
p30
aa(lp31
VThis level of accuracy
p32
aVhas unleashed a firestorm of innovation.
p33
aVIn fact, many of you navigated here today
p34
aVwith the help of your TomTom or your smartphone.
p35
aVPaper maps are becoming obsolete.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut we now stand on the verge of another revolution
p38
aVin geolocation accuracy.
p39
aVWhat if I told you that the two-meter positioning
p40
aVthat our current cell phones and our TomToms give us
p41
aVis pathetic compared to what we could be getting?
p42
aVFor some time now, it's been known that if you pay attention
p43
aVto the carrier phase of the GPS signal,
p44
aVand if you have an Internet connection,
p45
aVthen you can go from meter level to centimeter level,
p46
aVeven millimeter-level positioning.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo why don't we have this capability on our phones?
p49
aVOnly, I believe, for a lack of imagination.
p50
aVManufacturers haven't built this carrier phase technique
p51
aVinto their cheap GPS chips
p52
aVbecause they're not sure what the general public would do
p53
aVwith geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint
p54
aVthe wrinkles in the palm of your hand.
p55
aVBut you and I and other innovators,
p56
aVwe can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy.
p57
aVImagine, for example, an augmented reality app
p58
aVthat overlays a virtual world to millimeter-level precision
p59
aVon top of the physical world.
p60
aVI could build for you a structure up here in 3D,
p61
aVmillimeter accurate, that only you could see,
p62
aVor my friends at home.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo this level of positioning, this is what we're looking for,
p65
aVand I believe that, within the next few years, I predict,
p66
aVthat this kind of hyper-precise, carrier phase-based positioning
p67
aVwill become cheap and ubiquitous,
p68
aVand the consequences will be fantastic.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe Holy Grail, of course, is the GPS dot.
p71
aVDo you remember the movie "The Da Vinci Code?"
p72
aVHere's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot,
p73
aVwhich his accomplice tells him is a tracking device
p74
aVaccurate within two feet anywhere on the globe,
p75
aVbut we know that in the world of nonfiction,
p76
aVthe GPS dot is impossible, right?
p77
aVFor one thing, GPS doesn't work indoors,
p78
aVand for another, they don't make devices quite this small,
p79
aVespecially when those devices have to relay
p80
aVtheir measurements back over a network.
p81
aa(lp82
VWell, these objections were perfectly reasonable
p83
aVa few years ago, but things have changed.
p84
aVThere's been a strong trend toward miniaturization,
p85
aVbetter sensitivity, so much so that, a few years ago,
p86
aVa GPS tracking device looked like this clunky box
p87
aVto the left of the keys.
p88
aVCompare that with the device released just months ago
p89
aVthat's now packaged into something the size of a key fob,
p90
aVand if you take a look at the state of the art
p91
aVfor a complete GPS receiver, which is only a centimeter
p92
aVon a side and more sensitive than ever,
p93
aVyou realize that the GPS dot will soon move
p94
aVfrom fiction to nonfiction.
p95
aa(lp96
VImagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots.
p97
aVIt's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys
p98
aVanymore, or your child when you're at Disneyland.
p99
aVYou'll buy GPS dots in bulk, and you'll stick them on
p100
aVeverything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars.
p101
aa(lp102
VI couldn't find my shoes one recent morning,
p103
aVand, as usual, had to ask my wife if she had seen them.
p104
aVBut I shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality.
p105
aVI should be able to ask my house where my shoes are.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VThose of you who have made the switch to Gmail,
p109
aVremember how refreshing it was to go from
p110
aVorganizing all of your email to simply searching it.
p111
aVThe GPS dot will do the same for our possessions.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, of course, there is a flip side to the GPS dot.
p114
aVI was in my office some months back
p115
aVand got a telephone call.
p116
aVThe woman on the other end of the line, we'll call her Carol,
p117
aVwas panicked.
p118
aVApparently, an ex-boyfriend of Carol's from California
p119
aVhad found her in Texas and was following her around.
p120
aVSo you might ask at this point why she's calling you.
p121
aVWell, so did I.
p122
aVBut it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case.
p123
aVEvery time her ex-boyfriend would show up,
p124
aVat the most improbable times and the most improbable locations,
p125
aVhe was carrying an open laptop,
p126
aVand over time Carol realized that he had planted
p127
aVa GPS tracking device on her car,
p128
aVso she was calling me for help to disable it.
p129
aa(lp130
V"Well, you should go to a good mechanic
p131
aVand have him look at your car," I said.
p132
aa(lp133
V"I already have," she told me.
p134
aV"He didn't see anything obvious,
p135
aVand he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece."
p136
aa(lp137
V"Well then, you'd better go to the police," I said.
p138
aa(lp139
V"I already have," she replied.
p140
aV"They're not sure this rises to the level of harassment,
p141
aVand they're not set up technically to find the device."
p142
aa(lp143
V"Okay, what about the FBI?"
p144
aa(lp145
V"I've talked to them too, and same story."
p146
aa(lp147
VWe then talked about her coming to my lab
p148
aVand us performing a radio sweep of her car,
p149
aVbut I wasn't even sure that would work,
p150
aVgiven that some of these devices are configured
p151
aVto only transmit when they're inside safe zones
p152
aVor when the car is moving.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo, there we were.
p155
aVCarol isn't the first, and certainly won't be the last,
p156
aVto find herself in this kind of fearsome environment,
p157
aVworrisome situation caused by GPS tracking.
p158
aa(lp159
VIn fact, as I looked into her case,
p160
aVI discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal
p161
aVfor you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car.
p162
aVThe Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman
p163
aVhas to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking,
p164
aVbut the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another,
p165
aVso it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about,
p166
aVbut Big Neighbor. (Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VThere is one alternative that Carol could have taken,
p169
aVvery effective. It's called the Wave Bubble.
p170
aVIt's an open-source GPS jammer,
p171
aVdeveloped by Limor Fried,
p172
aVa graduate student at MIT, and Limor calls it
p173
aV"a tool for reclaiming our personal space."
p174
aVWith a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you
p175
aVwithin which GPS signals can't reside.
p176
aVThey get drowned out by the bubble.
p177
aVAnd Limor designed this, in part, because, like Carol,
p178
aVshe felt threatened by GPS tracking.
p179
aVThen she posted her design to the web,
p180
aVand if you don't have time to build your own,
p181
aVyou can buy one.
p182
aVChinese manufacturers now sell thousands
p183
aVof nearly identical devices on the Internet.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo you might be thinking, the Wave Bubble sounds great.
p186
aVI should have one. Might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car.
p187
aVBut you should be aware that its use is very much illegal
p188
aVin the United States.
p189
aVAnd why is that?
p190
aVWell, because it's not a bubble at all.
p191
aVIts jamming signals don't stop at the edge
p192
aVof your personal space or at the edge of your car.
p193
aVThey go on to jam innocent GPS receivers for miles around you. (Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, if you're Carol or Limor,
p196
aVor someone who feels threatened by GPS tracking,
p197
aVit might not feel wrong to turn on a Wave Bubble,
p198
aVbut in fact, the results can be disastrous.
p199
aVImagine, for example, you're the captain of a cruise ship
p200
aVtrying to make your way through a thick fog
p201
aVand some passenger in the back turns on a Wave Bubble.
p202
aVAll of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank,
p203
aVand now it's just you and the fog
p204
aVand whatever you can pull off the radar system
p205
aVif you remember how to work it.
p206
aVThey \u2014 in fact, they don't update or upkeep lighthouses
p207
aVanymore, and LORAN, the only backup to GPS,
p208
aVwas discontinued last year.
p209
aa(lp210
VOur modern society has a special relationship with GPS.
p211
aVWe're almost blindly reliant on it.
p212
aVIt's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure.
p213
aVSome call it "the invisible utility."
p214
aVSo, turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience.
p215
aVIt might be deadly.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut as it turns out, for purposes of protecting your privacy
p218
aVat the expense of general GPS reliability,
p219
aVthere's something even more potent
p220
aVand more subversive than a Wave Bubble,
p221
aVand that is a GPS spoofer.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple.
p224
aVInstead of jamming the GPS signals, you fake them.
p225
aVYou imitate them, and if you do it right, the device
p226
aVyou're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo let me show you how this works.
p229
aVIn any GPS receiver, there's a peak inside
p230
aVthat corresponds to the authentic signals.
p231
aVThese three red dots represent the tracking points
p232
aVthat try to keep themselves centered on that peak.
p233
aVBut if you send in a fake GPS signal,
p234
aVanother peak pops up, and if you can get these two peaks
p235
aVperfectly aligned, the tracking points can't tell the difference,
p236
aVand they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal,
p237
aVwith the authentic peak getting forced off.
p238
aVAt this point, the game is over.
p239
aVThe fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo is this really possible?
p242
aVCan someone really manipulate
p243
aVthe timing and positioning of a GPS receiver
p244
aVjust like that, with a spoofer?
p245
aVWell, the short answer is yes.
p246
aVThe key is that civil GPS signals
p247
aVare completely open.
p248
aVThey have no encryption. They have no authentication.
p249
aVThey're wide open, vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack.
p250
aVEven so, up until very recently,
p251
aVnobody worried about GPS spoofers.
p252
aVPeople figured that it would be too complex
p253
aVor too expensive for some hacker to build one.
p254
aa(lp255
VBut I, and a friend of mine from graduate school,
p256
aVwe didn't see it that way.
p257
aVWe knew it wasn't going to be so hard,
p258
aVand we wanted to be the first to build one
p259
aVso we could get out in front of the problem
p260
aVand help protect against GPS spoofing.
p261
aVI remember vividly the week it all came together.
p262
aVWe built it at my home, which means that
p263
aVI got a little extra help from my three-year-old son Ramon.
p264
aVHere's Ramon \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p265
aVlooking for a little attention from Dad that week.
p266
aVAt first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables
p267
aVand computers, though we eventually got it packaged
p268
aVinto a small box.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow, the Dr. Frankenstein moment,
p271
aVwhen the spoofer finally came alive
p272
aVand I glimpsed its awful potential,
p273
aVcame late one night when I tested the spoofer
p274
aVagainst my iPhone.
p275
aVLet me show you some actual footage from that
p276
aVvery first experiment.
p277
aVI had come to completely trust this little blue dot
p278
aVand its reassuring blue halo.
p279
aVThey seemed to speak to me.
p280
aVThey'd say, "Here you are. Here you are." (Laughter)
p281
aVAnd "you can trust us."
p282
aVSo something felt very wrong about the world.
p283
aVIt was a sense, almost, of betrayal,
p284
aVwhen this little blue dot started at my house,
p285
aVand went running off toward the north
p286
aVleaving me behind. I wasn't moving.
p287
aVWhat I then saw in this little moving blue dot
p288
aVwas the potential for chaos.
p289
aVI saw airplanes and ships veering off course, with the captain
p290
aVlearning only too late that something was wrong.
p291
aVI saw the GPS-derived timing
p292
aVof the New York Stock Exchange
p293
aVbeing manipulated by hackers.
p294
aVYou can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc
p295
aVyou could cause if you knew what you were doing
p296
aVwith a GPS spoofer.
p297
aa(lp298
VThere is, though, one redeeming feature
p299
aVof the GPS spoofer.
p300
aVIt's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots.
p301
aVImagine, for example, you're being tracked.
p302
aVWell, you can play the tracker for a fool,
p303
aVpretending to be at work when you're really on vacation.
p304
aVOr, if you're Carol, you could lure your ex-boyfriend
p305
aVinto some empty parking lot
p306
aVwhere the police are waiting for him.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo I'm fascinated by this conflict, a looming conflict,
p309
aVbetween privacy on the one hand
p310
aVand the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other.
p311
aVWe simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers,
p312
aVand yet, given the lack of effective legal means
p313
aVfor protecting our privacy from the GPS dot,
p314
aVcan you really blame people for wanting to turn them on,
p315
aVfor wanting to use them?
p316
aa(lp317
VI hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile
p318
aVthis conflict with some sort of,
p319
aVsome yet uninvented technology.
p320
aVBut meanwhile, grab some popcorn,
p321
aVbecause things are going to get interesting.
p322
aa(lp323
VWithin the next few years,
p324
aVmany of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot.
p325
aVMaybe you'll have a whole bag full of them.
p326
aVYou'll never lose track of your things again.
p327
aVThe GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life.
p328
aVBut will you be able to resist the temptation
p329
aVto track your fellow man?
p330
aVOr will you be able to resist the temptation
p331
aVto turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble
p332
aVto protect your own privacy?
p333
aa(lp334
VSo, as usual, what we see just beyond the horizon
p335
aVis full of promise and peril.
p336
aVIt'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out.
p337
aa(lp338
VThanks. (Applause)

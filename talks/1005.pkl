VThis cell phone
p5
aVstarted its trajectory
p6
aVin an artisanal mine
p7
aVin the Eastern Congo.
p8
aVIt's mined by armed gangs
p9
aVusing slaves, child slaves,
p10
aVwhat the U.N. Security Council
p11
aVcalls "blood minerals,"
p12
aVthen traveled into some components
p13
aVand ended up in a factory
p14
aVin Shinjin in China.
p15
aVThat factory \u2014 over a dozen people have committed suicide
p16
aValready this year.
p17
aVOne man died after working a 36-hour shift.
p18
aVWe all love chocolate.
p19
aVWe buy it for our kids.
p20
aVEighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana
p21
aVand it's harvested by children.
p22
aVCote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves.
p23
aVChildren have been trafficked from other conflict zones
p24
aVto come and work on the coffee plantations.
p25
aVHeparin \u2014 a blood thinner,
p26
aVa pharmaceutical product \u2014
p27
aVstarts out in artisanal workshops
p28
aVlike this in China,
p29
aVbecause the active ingredient
p30
aVcomes from pigs' intestines.
p31
aVYour diamond \u2014 you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond."
p32
aVThis is a mine in Zimbabwe
p33
aVright now.
p34
aVCotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest
p35
aVexporter of cotton on Earth.
p36
aVEvery year when it comes to the cotton harvest,
p37
aVthe government shuts down the schools,
p38
aVputs the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fields
p39
aVto spend three weeks harvesting the cotton.
p40
aVIt's forced child labor
p41
aVon an institutional scale.
p42
aVAnd all of those products probably end their lives
p43
aVin a dump like this one in Manila.
p44
aa(lp45
VThese places, these origins,
p46
aVrepresent governance gaps.
p47
aVThat's the politest description
p48
aVI have for them.
p49
aVThese are the dark pools
p50
aVwhere global supply chains begin \u2014
p51
aVthe global supply chains,
p52
aVwhich bring us our favorite brand name products.
p53
aVSome of these governance gaps
p54
aVare run by rogue states.
p55
aVSome of them are not states anymore at all.
p56
aVThey're failed states.
p57
aVSome of them
p58
aVare just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation
p59
aVis the best way to attract investment,
p60
aVpromote trade.
p61
aVEither way, they present us
p62
aVwith a huge moral and ethical dilemma.
p63
aVI know that none of us want to be accessories
p64
aVafter the fact
p65
aVof a human rights abuse
p66
aVin a global supply chain.
p67
aVBut right now,
p68
aVmost of the companies involved in these supply chains
p69
aVdon't have any way
p70
aVof assuring us
p71
aVthat nobody had to mortgage their future,
p72
aVnobody had to sacrifice their rights
p73
aVto bring us our favorite
p74
aVbrand name product.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, I didn't come here to depress you
p77
aVabout the state of the global supply chain.
p78
aVWe need a reality check.
p79
aVWe need to recognize just how serious
p80
aVa deficit of rights we have.
p81
aVThis is an independent republic,
p82
aVprobably a failed state.
p83
aVIt's definitely not a democratic state.
p84
aVAnd right now,
p85
aVthat independent republic of the supply chain
p86
aVis not being governed
p87
aVin a way that would satisfy us,
p88
aVthat we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption.
p89
aVNow, that's not a new story.
p90
aVYou've seen the documentaries
p91
aVof sweatshops making garments
p92
aVall over the world, even in developed countries.
p93
aVYou want to see the classic sweatshop,
p94
aVmeet me at Madison Square Garden,
p95
aVI'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut take the example of heparin.
p98
aVIt's a pharmaceutical product.
p99
aVYou expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital,
p100
aVprobably squeaky clean.
p101
aVThe problem is that the active ingredient in there \u2014
p102
aVas I mentioned earlier \u2014
p103
aVcomes from pigs.
p104
aVThe main American manufacturer
p105
aVof that active ingredient
p106
aVdecided a few years ago to relocate to China
p107
aVbecause it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs.
p108
aVAnd their factory in China \u2014
p109
aVwhich probably is pretty clean \u2014
p110
aVis getting all of the ingredients
p111
aVfrom backyard abattoirs,
p112
aVwhere families slaughter pigs
p113
aVand extract the ingredient.
p114
aVSo a couple of years ago, we had a scandal
p115
aVwhich killed about 80 people around the world,
p116
aVbecause of contaminants
p117
aVthat crept into the heparin supply chain.
p118
aVWorse, some of the suppliers
p119
aVrealized that they could substitute a product
p120
aVwhich mimicked heparin in tests.
p121
aVThis substitute cost nine dollars a pound,
p122
aVwhereas real heparin, the real ingredient,
p123
aVcost 900 dollars a pound.
p124
aVA no-brainer.
p125
aVThe problem was that it killed more people.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd so you're asking yourself,
p128
aV"How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
p129
aVallowed this to happen?
p130
aVHow did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs
p131
aVallow this to happen?"
p132
aVAnd the answer is quite simple:
p133
aVthe Chinese define these facilities
p134
aVas chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities,
p135
aVso they don't audit them.
p136
aVAnd the USFDA
p137
aVhas a jurisdictional problem.
p138
aVThis is offshore.
p139
aVThey actually do conduct a few investigations overseas \u2014
p140
aVabout a dozen a year \u2014 maybe 20 in a good year.
p141
aVThere are 500
p142
aVof these facilities
p143
aVproducing active ingredients in China alone.
p144
aVIn fact, about 80 percent
p145
aVof the active ingredients in medicines now
p146
aVcome from offshore,
p147
aVparticularly China and India,
p148
aVand we don't have a governance system.
p149
aVWe don't have a regulatory system
p150
aVable to ensure
p151
aVthat that production is safe.
p152
aVWe don't have a system to ensure
p153
aVthat human rights, basic dignity,
p154
aVare ensured.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo at a national level \u2014
p157
aVand we work in about 60 different countries \u2014
p158
aVat a national level
p159
aVwe've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments
p160
aVto regulate production
p161
aVon their own soil.
p162
aVAnd the real problem with the global supply chain
p163
aVis that it's supranational.
p164
aVSo governments who are failing,
p165
aVwho are dropping the ball
p166
aVat a national level,
p167
aVhave even less ability to get their arms around the problem
p168
aVat an international level.
p169
aVAnd you can just look at the headlines.
p170
aVTake Copenhagen last year \u2014
p171
aVcomplete failure of governments
p172
aVto do the right thing
p173
aVin the face of an international challenge.
p174
aVTake the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago \u2014
p175
aVstepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago.
p176
aVYou can take any one
p177
aVof the major global challenges we've discussed this week
p178
aVand ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments
p179
aVto step up and come up with solutions,
p180
aVresponses,
p181
aVto those international problems?
p182
aVAnd the simple answer is they can't. They're national.
p183
aVTheir voters are local.
p184
aVThey have parochial interests.
p185
aVThey can't subordinate those interests
p186
aVto the greater global public good.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, if we're going to ensure the delivery
p189
aVof the key public goods
p190
aVat an international level \u2014
p191
aVin this case, in the global supply chain \u2014
p192
aVwe have to come up with a different mechanism.
p193
aVWe need a different machine.
p194
aVFortunately, we have some examples.
p195
aVIn the 1990s,
p196
aVthere were a whole series of scandals
p197
aVconcerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. \u2014
p198
aVchild labor, forced labor,
p199
aVserious health and safety abuses.
p200
aVAnd eventually President Clinton, in 1996,
p201
aVconvened a meeting at the White House,
p202
aVinvited industry, human rights NGOs,
p203
aVtrade unions, the Department of Labor,
p204
aVgot them all in a room
p205
aVand said, "Look,
p206
aVI don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom.
p207
aVI don't know how to prevent that,
p208
aVbut I'm at least going to use my good offices
p209
aVto get you folks together
p210
aVto come up with a response."
p211
aVSo they formed a White House task force,
p212
aVand they spent about three years arguing
p213
aVabout who takes how much responsibility
p214
aVin the global supply chain.
p215
aVCompanies didn't feel it was their responsibility.
p216
aVThey don't own those facilities.
p217
aVThey don't employ those workers.
p218
aVThey're not legally liable.
p219
aVEverybody else at the table
p220
aVsaid, "Folks, that doesn't cut it.
p221
aVYou have a custodial duty, a duty of care,
p222
aVto make sure that that product
p223
aVgets from wherever to the store
p224
aVin a way that allows us to consume it,
p225
aVwithout fear of our safety,
p226
aVor without having to sacrifice our conscience
p227
aVto consume that product."
p228
aVSo they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do
p229
aVis we agree on a common set of standards,
p230
aVcode of conduct.
p231
aVWe'll apply that throughout
p232
aVour global supply chain
p233
aVregardless of ownership or control.
p234
aVWe'll make it part of the contract."
p235
aVAnd that was a stroke of absolute genius,
p236
aVbecause what they did
p237
aVwas they harnessed the power of the contract,
p238
aVprivate power,
p239
aVto deliver public goods.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd let's face it,
p242
aVthe contract from a major multinational brand
p243
aVto a supplier in India or China
p244
aVhas much more persuasive value
p245
aVthan the local labor law,
p246
aVthe local environmental regulations,
p247
aVthe local human rights standards.
p248
aVThose factories will probably never see an inspector.
p249
aVIf the inspector did come along,
p250
aVit would be amazing if they were able
p251
aVto resist the bribe.
p252
aVEven if they did their jobs,
p253
aVand they cited those facilities for their violations,
p254
aVthe fine would be derisory.
p255
aVBut you lose that contract
p256
aVfor a major brand name,
p257
aVthat's the difference
p258
aVbetween staying in business or going bankrupt.
p259
aVThat makes a difference.
p260
aVSo what we've been able to do
p261
aVis we've been able to harness
p262
aVthe power and the influence
p263
aVof the only truly transnational institution
p264
aVin the global supply chain,
p265
aVthat of the multinational company,
p266
aVand get them to do the right thing,
p267
aVget them to use that power for good,
p268
aVto deliver the key public goods.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow of course, this doesn't come naturally
p271
aVto multinational companies.
p272
aVThey weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money.
p273
aVBut they are extremely efficient organizations.
p274
aVThey have resources,
p275
aVand if we can add the will, the commitment,
p276
aVthey know how to deliver that product.
p277
aVNow, getting there is not easy.
p278
aVThose supply chains I put up on the screen earlier,
p279
aVthey're not there.
p280
aVYou need a safe space.
p281
aVYou need a place where people can come together,
p282
aVsit down without fear of judgment,
p283
aVwithout recrimination,
p284
aVto actually face the problem,
p285
aVagree on the problem and come up with solutions.
p286
aVWe can do it. The technical solutions are there.
p287
aVThe problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence,
p288
aVthe lack of partnership
p289
aVbetween NGOs, campaign groups,
p290
aVcivil society organizations
p291
aVand multinational companies.
p292
aVIf we can put those two together in a safe space,
p293
aVget them to work together,
p294
aVwe can deliver public goods right now,
p295
aVor in extremely short supply.
p296
aa(lp297
VThis is a radical proposition,
p298
aVand it's crazy to think
p299
aVthat if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl
p300
aVleaving your rural village
p301
aVto go and work in a factory in Dhaka \u2014
p302
aV22, 23, 24 dollars a month \u2014
p303
aVyour best chance of enjoying rights at work
p304
aVis if that factory is producing
p305
aVfor a brand name company
p306
aVwhich has got a code of conduct
p307
aVand made that code of conduct part of the contract.
p308
aVIt's crazy.
p309
aVMultinationals are protecting human rights.
p310
aVI know there's going to be disbelief.
p311
aVYou'll say, "How can we trust them?"
p312
aVWell, we don't.
p313
aVIt's the old arms control phrase:
p314
aV"Trust, but verify."
p315
aVSo we audit.
p316
aVWe take their supply chain, we take all the factory names,
p317
aVwe do a random sample,
p318
aVwe send inspectors on an unannounced basis
p319
aVto inspect those facilities,
p320
aVand then we publish the results.
p321
aVTransparency is absolutely critical to this.
p322
aVYou can call yourself responsible,
p323
aVbut responsibility without accountability
p324
aVoften doesn't work.
p325
aVSo what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals,
p326
aVwe're giving them the tools to deliver this public good \u2014
p327
aVrespect for human rights \u2014
p328
aVand we're checking.
p329
aVYou don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me.
p330
aVGo to the website. Look at the audit results.
p331
aVAsk yourself, is this company behaving
p332
aVin a socially responsible way?
p333
aVCan I buy that product
p334
aVwithout compromising my ethics?
p335
aVThat's the way the system works.
p336
aa(lp337
VI hate the idea
p338
aVthat governments are not protecting human rights around the world.
p339
aVI hate the idea
p340
aVthat governments have dropped this ball
p341
aVand I can't get used to the idea
p342
aVthat somehow we can't get them to do their jobs.
p343
aVI've been at this for 30 years,
p344
aVand in that time I've seen
p345
aVthe ability, the commitment, the will of government
p346
aVto do this decline,
p347
aVand I don't see them making a comeback right now.
p348
aVSo we started out thinking
p349
aVthis was a stopgap measure.
p350
aVWe're now thinking that, in fact,
p351
aVthis is probably the start
p352
aVof a new way of regulating and addressing
p353
aVinternational challenges.
p354
aVCall it network governance. Call it what you will.
p355
aVThe private actors,
p356
aVcompanies and NGOs,
p357
aVare going to have to get together
p358
aVto face the major challenges we are going to face.
p359
aVJust look at pandemics \u2014
p360
aVswine flu, bird flu, H1N1.
p361
aVLook at the health systems in so many countries.
p362
aVDo they have the resources
p363
aVto face up to a serious pandemic?
p364
aVNo.
p365
aVCould the private sector and NGOs
p366
aVget together and marshal a response?
p367
aVAbsolutely.
p368
aVWhat they lack is that safe space
p369
aVto come together, agree
p370
aVand move to action.
p371
aVThat's what we're trying to provide.
p372
aa(lp373
VI know as well
p374
aVthat this often seems
p375
aVlike an overwhelming level of responsibility
p376
aVfor people to assume.
p377
aV"You want me to deliver human rights
p378
aVthroughout my global supply chain.
p379
aVThere are thousands of suppliers in there."
p380
aVIt seems too daunting, too dangerous,
p381
aVfor any company to take on.
p382
aVBut there are companies.
p383
aVWe have 4,000 companies who are members.
p384
aVSome of them are very, very large companies.
p385
aVThe sporting goods industry, in particular,
p386
aVstepped up to the plate and have done it.
p387
aVThe example, the role model, is there.
p388
aVAnd whenever we discuss
p389
aVone of these problems that we have to address \u2014
p390
aVchild labor in cottonseed farms in India \u2014
p391
aVthis year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India.
p392
aVIt seems overwhelming.
p393
aVThe numbers just make you want to zone out.
p394
aVBut we break it down to some basic realities.
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd human rights
p397
aVcomes down to a very simple proposition:
p398
aVcan I give this person their dignity back?
p399
aVPoor people,
p400
aVpeople whose human rights have been violated \u2014
p401
aVthe crux of that
p402
aVis the loss of dignity,
p403
aVthe lack of dignity.
p404
aVIt starts with just giving people back their dignity.
p405
aVI was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon
p406
aVjust next to Delhi,
p407
aVone of the flashiest, brightest new cities
p408
aVpopping up in India right now,
p409
aVand I was talking to workers
p410
aVwho worked in garment sweatshops down the road,
p411
aVand I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands.
p412
aVThey didn't say money.
p413
aVThey said, "The people who employ us
p414
aVtreat us like we are less than human,
p415
aVlike we don't exist.
p416
aVPlease ask them to treat us like human beings."
p417
aVThat's my simple understanding of human rights.
p418
aVThat's my simple proposition to you,
p419
aVmy simple plea to every decision-maker
p420
aVin this room, everybody out there.
p421
aVWe can all make a decision
p422
aVto come together
p423
aVand pick up the balls and run with the balls
p424
aVthat governments have dropped.
p425
aVIf we don't do it,
p426
aVwe're abandoning hope,
p427
aVwe're abandoning our essential humanity,
p428
aVand I know that's not a place we want to be,
p429
aVand we don't have to be there.
p430
aVSo I appeal to you.
p431
aVJoin us, come into that safe space,
p432
aVand let's start to make this happen.
p433
aa(lp434
VThank you very much.

(Later, in post-apartheid South Africa, he became labor attach&eacute; to the South African mission to the UN.)

Policing the entire chain is impossible, so the FLA works instead to help all parties agree that protecting workers is the best way to do business, and agree on voluntary initiatives to get there. The FLA worked with Apple Computer, for example, to inspect its global factories and seek raises and better working conditions at the Foxconn plant in China. </p><p>Van Heerden and FLA create a safe space in which stakeholders representing different interest groups within a global supply chain can work together to resolve conflicts of rights and interests, filling in the governance gap.

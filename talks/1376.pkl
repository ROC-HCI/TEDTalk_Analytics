VGood morning.
p5
aVI'm here today to talk about autonomous flying beach balls.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VNo, agile aerial robots like this one.
p10
aVI'd like to tell you a little bit about the challenges in building these,
p11
aVand some of the terrific opportunities for applying this technology.
p12
aVSo these robots are related to unmanned aerial vehicles.
p13
aVHowever, the vehicles you see here are big.
p14
aVThey weigh thousands of pounds, are not by any means agile.
p15
aVThey're not even autonomous.
p16
aVIn fact, many of these vehicles are operated by flight crews
p17
aVthat can include multiple pilots,
p18
aVoperators of sensors,
p19
aVand mission coordinators.
p20
aa(lp21
VWhat we're interested in is developing robots like this \u2014
p22
aVand here are two other pictures \u2014
p23
aVof robots that you can buy off the shelf.
p24
aVSo these are helicopters with four rotors,
p25
aVand they're roughly a meter or so in scale,
p26
aVand weigh several pounds.
p27
aVAnd so we retrofit these with sensors and processors,
p28
aVand these robots can fly indoors.
p29
aVWithout GPS.
p30
aa(lp31
VThe robot I'm holding in my hand
p32
aVis this one,
p33
aVand it's been created by two students,
p34
aVAlex and Daniel.
p35
aVSo this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound.
p36
aVIt consumes about 15 watts of power.
p37
aVAnd as you can see, it's about eight inches in diameter.
p38
aVSo let me give you just a very quick tutorial
p39
aVon how these robots work.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo it has four rotors.
p42
aVIf you spin these rotors at the same speed,
p43
aVthe robot hovers.
p44
aVIf you increase the speed of each of these rotors,
p45
aVthen the robot flies up, it accelerates up.
p46
aVOf course, if the robot were tilted,
p47
aVinclined to the horizontal,
p48
aVthen it would accelerate in this direction.
p49
aVSo to get it to tilt,
p50
aVthere's one of two ways of doing it.
p51
aVSo in this picture, you see that rotor four is spinning faster
p52
aVand rotor two is spinning slower.
p53
aVAnd when that happens,
p54
aVthere's a moment that causes this robot to roll.
p55
aVAnd the other way around,
p56
aVif you increase the speed of rotor three and decrease the speed of rotor one,
p57
aVthen the robot pitches forward.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd then finally,
p60
aVif you spin opposite pairs of rotors
p61
aVfaster than the other pair,
p62
aVthen the robot yaws about the vertical axis.
p63
aVSo an on-board processor
p64
aVessentially looks at what motions need to be executed
p65
aVand combines these motions,
p66
aVand figures out what commands to send to the motors \u2014
p67
aV600 times a second.
p68
aVThat's basically how this thing operates.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo one of the advantages of this design
p71
aVis when you scale things down,
p72
aVthe robot naturally becomes agile.
p73
aVSo here, R is the characteristic length of the robot.
p74
aVIt's actually half the diameter.
p75
aVAnd there are lots of physical parameters that change as you reduce R.
p76
aVThe one that's most important is the inertia,
p77
aVor the resistance to motion.
p78
aVSo it turns out the inertia, which governs angular motion,
p79
aVscales as a fifth power of R.
p80
aVSo the smaller you make R,
p81
aVthe more dramatically the inertia reduces.
p82
aVSo as a result, the angular acceleration,
p83
aVdenoted by the Greek letter alpha here,
p84
aVgoes as 1 over R.
p85
aVIt's inversely proportional to R.
p86
aVThe smaller you make it, the more quickly you can turn.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo this should be clear in these videos.
p89
aVOn the bottom right, you see a robot performing a 360-degree flip
p90
aVin less than half a second.
p91
aVMultiple flips, a little more time.
p92
aVSo here the processes on board
p93
aVare getting feedback from accelerometers and gyros on board,
p94
aVand calculating, like I said before,
p95
aVcommands at 600 times a second,
p96
aVto stabilize this robot.
p97
aVSo on the left, you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air,
p98
aVand it shows you how robust the control is.
p99
aVNo matter how you throw it,
p100
aVthe robot recovers and comes back to him.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo why build robots like this?
p103
aVWell, robots like this have many applications.
p104
aVYou can send them inside buildings like this,
p105
aVas first responders to look for intruders,
p106
aVmaybe look for biochemical leaks,
p107
aVgaseous leaks.
p108
aVYou can also use them for applications like construction.
p109
aVSo here are robots carrying beams, columns
p110
aVand assembling cube-like structures.
p111
aVI'll tell you a little bit more about this.
p112
aVThe robots can be used for transporting cargo.
p113
aVSo one of the problems with these small robots
p114
aVis their payload-carrying capacity.
p115
aVSo you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads.
p116
aVThis is a picture of a recent experiment we did \u2014
p117
aVactually not so recent anymore \u2014
p118
aVin Sendai, shortly after the earthquake.
p119
aVSo robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings,
p120
aVto assess the damage after natural disasters,
p121
aVor sent into reactor buildings,
p122
aVto map radiation levels.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo one fundamental problem that the robots have to solve
p125
aVif they are to be autonomous,
p126
aVis essentially figuring out how to get from point A to point B.
p127
aVSo this gets a little challenging,
p128
aVbecause the dynamics of this robot are quite complicated.
p129
aVIn fact, they live in a 12-dimensional space.
p130
aVSo we use a little trick.
p131
aVWe take this curved 12-dimensional space,
p132
aVand transform it into a flat, four-dimensional space.
p133
aVAnd that four-dimensional space consists of X, Y, Z,
p134
aVand then the yaw angle.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd so what the robot does,
p137
aVis it plans what we call a minimum-snap trajectory.
p138
aVSo to remind you of physics:
p139
aVYou have position, derivative, velocity;
p140
aVthen acceleration;
p141
aVand then comes jerk,
p142
aVand then comes snap.
p143
aVSo this robot minimizes snap.
p144
aVSo what that effectively does,
p145
aVis produce a smooth and graceful motion.
p146
aVAnd it does that avoiding obstacles.
p147
aVSo these minimum-snap trajectories in this flat space are then transformed
p148
aVback into this complicated 12-dimensional space,
p149
aVwhich the robot must do for control and then execution.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo let me show you some examples
p152
aVof what these minimum-snap trajectories look like.
p153
aVAnd in the first video,
p154
aVyou'll see the robot going from point A to point B,
p155
aVthrough an intermediate point.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Whirring noise)
p158
aa(lp159
VSo the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory.
p160
aVSo these are circular trajectories,
p161
aVwhere the robot pulls about two G's.
p162
aVHere you have overhead motion capture cameras on the top
p163
aVthat tell the robot where it is 100 times a second.
p164
aVIt also tells the robot where these obstacles are.
p165
aVAnd the obstacles can be moving.
p166
aVAnd here, you'll see Daniel throw this hoop into the air,
p167
aVwhile the robot is calculating the position of the hoop,
p168
aVand trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop.
p169
aVSo as an academic,
p170
aVwe're always trained to be able to jump through hoops
p171
aVto raise funding for our labs,
p172
aVand we get our robots to do that.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VSo another thing the robot can do
p177
aVis it remembers pieces of trajectory
p178
aVthat it learns or is pre-programmed.
p179
aVSo here, you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum,
p180
aVand then changes its orientation and then recovers.
p181
aVSo it has to do this because this gap in the window
p182
aVis only slightly larger than the width of the robot.
p183
aVSo just like a diver stands on a springboard
p184
aVand then jumps off it to gain momentum,
p185
aVand then does this pirouette, this two and a half somersault through
p186
aVand then gracefully recovers,
p187
aVthis robot is basically doing that.
p188
aVSo it knows how to combine little bits and pieces of trajectories
p189
aVto do these fairly difficult tasks.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo I want change gears.
p192
aVSo one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size.
p193
aVAnd I told you earlier
p194
aVthat we may want to employ lots and lots of robots
p195
aVto overcome the limitations of size.
p196
aVSo one difficulty is:
p197
aVHow do you coordinate lots of these robots?
p198
aVAnd so here, we looked to nature.
p199
aVSo I want to show you a clip of Aphaenogaster desert ants,
p200
aVin Professor Stephen Pratt's lab, carrying an object.
p201
aVSo this is actually a piece of fig.
p202
aVActually you take any object coated with fig juice,
p203
aVand the ants will carry it back to the nest.
p204
aVSo these ants don't have any central coordinator.
p205
aVThey sense their neighbors.
p206
aVThere's no explicit communication.
p207
aVBut because they sense the neighbors
p208
aVand because they sense the object,
p209
aVthey have implicit coordination across the group.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo this is the kind of coordination we want our robots to have.
p212
aVSo when we have a robot which is surrounded by neighbors \u2014
p213
aVand let's look at robot I and robot J \u2014
p214
aVwhat we want the robots to do,
p215
aVis to monitor the separation between them,
p216
aVas they fly in formation.
p217
aVAnd then you want to make sure
p218
aVthat this separation is within acceptable levels.
p219
aVSo again, the robots monitor this error
p220
aVand calculate the control commands 100 times a second,
p221
aVwhich then translates into motor commands,
p222
aV600 times a second.
p223
aVSo this also has to be done in a decentralized way.
p224
aVAgain, if you have lots and lots of robots,
p225
aVit's impossible to coordinate all this information centrally
p226
aVfast enough in order for the robots to accomplish the task.
p227
aVPlus, the robots have to base their actions only on local information \u2014
p228
aVwhat they sense from their neighbors.
p229
aVAnd then finally,
p230
aVwe insist that the robots be agnostic to who their neighbors are.
p231
aVSo this is what we call anonymity.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo what I want to show you next is a video of 20 of these little robots,
p234
aVflying in formation.
p235
aVThey're monitoring their neighbors' positions.
p236
aVThey're maintaining formation.
p237
aVThe formations can change.
p238
aVThey can be planar formations,
p239
aVthey can be three-dimensional formations.
p240
aVAs you can see here,
p241
aVthey collapse from a three-dimensional formation into planar formation.
p242
aVAnd to fly through obstacles,
p243
aVthey can adapt the formations on the fly.
p244
aVSo again, these robots come really close together.
p245
aVAs you can see in this figure-eight flight,
p246
aVthey come within inches of each other.
p247
aVAnd despite the aerodynamic interactions with these propeller blades,
p248
aVthey're able to maintain stable flight.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Applause)
p251
aa(lp252
VSo once you know how to fly in formation,
p253
aVyou can actually pick up objects cooperatively.
p254
aVSo this just shows that we can double, triple, quadruple
p255
aVthe robots' strength,
p256
aVby just getting them to team with neighbors, as you can see here.
p257
aVOne of the disadvantages of doing that is, as you scale things up \u2014
p258
aVso if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing,
p259
aVyou're essentially increasing the inertia,
p260
aVand therefore you pay a price; they're not as agile.
p261
aVBut you do gain in terms of payload-carrying capacity.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnother application I want to show you \u2014 again, this is in our lab.
p264
aVThis is work done by Quentin Lindsey, who's a graduate student.
p265
aVSo his algorithm essentially tells these robots
p266
aVhow to autonomously build cubic structures
p267
aVfrom truss-like elements.
p268
aVSo his algorithm tells the robot what part to pick up,
p269
aVwhen, and where to place it.
p270
aVSo in this video you see \u2014
p271
aVand it's sped up 10, 14 times \u2014
p272
aVyou see three different structures being built by these robots.
p273
aVAnd again, everything is autonomous,
p274
aVand all Quentin has to do
p275
aVis to give them a blueprint of the design that he wants to build.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo all these experiments you've seen thus far,
p278
aVall these demonstrations,
p279
aVhave been done with the help of motion-capture systems.
p280
aVSo what happens when you leave your lab,
p281
aVand you go outside into the real world?
p282
aVAnd what if there's no GPS?
p283
aVSo this robot is actually equipped with a camera,
p284
aVand a laser rangefinder, laser scanner.
p285
aVAnd it uses these sensors to build a map of the environment.
p286
aVWhat that map consists of are features \u2014
p287
aVlike doorways, windows, people, furniture \u2014
p288
aVand it then figures out where its position is,
p289
aVwith respect to the features.
p290
aVSo there is no global coordinate system.
p291
aVThe coordinate system is defined based on the robot,
p292
aVwhere it is and what it's looking at.
p293
aVAnd it navigates with respect to those features.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo I want to show you a clip
p296
aVof algorithms developed by Frank Shen and Professor Nathan Michael,
p297
aVthat shows this robot entering a building for the very first time,
p298
aVand creating this map on the fly.
p299
aVSo the robot then figures out what the features are,
p300
aVit builds the map,
p301
aVit figures out where it is with respect to the features,
p302
aVand then estimates its position 100 times a second,
p303
aVallowing us to use the control algorithms that I described to you earlier.
p304
aVSo this robot is actually being commanded remotely by Frank,
p305
aVbut the robot can also figure out where to go on its own.
p306
aVSo suppose I were to send this into a building,
p307
aVand I had no idea what this building looked like.
p308
aVI can ask this robot to go in,
p309
aVcreate a map,
p310
aVand then come back and tell me what the building looks like.
p311
aVSo here, the robot is not only solving the problem
p312
aVof how to go from point A to point B in this map,
p313
aVbut it's figuring out what the best point B is at every time.
p314
aVSo essentially it knows where to go
p315
aVto look for places that have the least information,
p316
aVand that's how it populates this map.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo I want to leave you with one last application.
p319
aVAnd there are many applications of this technology.
p320
aVI'm a professor, and we're passionate about education.
p321
aVRobots like this can really change the way we do K-12 education.
p322
aVBut we're in Southern California,
p323
aVclose to Los Angeles,
p324
aVso I have to conclude with something focused on entertainment.
p325
aVI want to conclude with a music video.
p326
aVI want to introduce the creators, Alex and Daniel, who created this video.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
VSo before I play this video,
p331
aVI want to tell you that they created it in the last three days,
p332
aVafter getting a call from Chris.
p333
aVAnd the robots that play in the video are completely autonomous.
p334
aVYou will see nine robots play six different instruments.
p335
aVAnd of course, it's made exclusively for TED 2012.
p336
aVLet's watch.

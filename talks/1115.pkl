VI have had the distinct blessing in my life
p5
aVto have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.
p6
aVBut the coolest I ever worked on
p7
aVwas around this guy.
p8
aVThis guy's name is TEMPT.
p9
aVTEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.
p10
aVAnd he came up home from a run one day
p11
aVand said, "Dad, my legs are tingling."
p12
aVAnd that was the onset of ALS.
p13
aVSo TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.
p14
aVHe only has use of his eyes.
p15
aa(lp16
VI was exposed to him.
p17
aVI have a company that does design and animation,
p18
aVso obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part
p19
aVof what we admire and respect in the art world.
p20
aVAnd so we decided that we were going to sponsor
p21
aVTony, TEMPT, and his cause.
p22
aVSo I went and met with his brother and father
p23
aVand said, "We're going to give you this money.
p24
aVWhat are you going to do with it?"
p25
aVAnd his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
p26
aVI just want to be able to communicate with him
p27
aVand him to be able to communicate with me."
p28
aVAnd I said, "Wait a second, isn't that \u2014 I've seen Stephen Hawking \u2014
p29
aVdon't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate
p30
aVvia these devices?"
p31
aVAnd he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and
p32
aVyou've got really amazing insurance,
p33
aVyou can't actually do that.
p34
aVThese devices aren't accessible to people."
p35
aVAnd I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?"
p36
aVHas everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?"
p37
aVThat's how they communicate \u2014
p38
aVso run their finger along.
p39
aVI said, "That's archaic. How can that be?"
p40
aa(lp41
VSo I showed up with the desire to just write a check,
p42
aVand instead, I wrote a check
p43
aVthat I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.
p44
aVI committed to his brother and his father right then and there \u2014
p45
aVI'm like, "All right, here's the deal:
p46
aVTony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine,
p47
aVand we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.
p48
aVBecause it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him
p49
aVisn't able to communicate it."
p50
aa(lp51
VSo I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.
p52
aVI met these guys called GRL,
p53
aVGraffiti Research Lab,
p54
aVand they have a technology
p55
aVthat allows them to project a light onto any surface
p56
aVand then, with a laser pointer, draw on it,
p57
aVand it just registers the negative space.
p58
aVSo they go around and do art installations like this.
p59
aVAll the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.
p60
aVFirst it starts with the sexual organs,
p61
aVthen it starts with cuss words,
p62
aVthen it was Bush slanders
p63
aVand then people actually got to art.
p64
aVBut there was always a life cycle to their presentations.
p65
aVSo I went home and was having dinner with my wife
p66
aVand was telling her about this,
p67
aVand we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists
p68
aVwhere you can use your eyes to control things,
p69
aVwhy don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser
p70
aVand he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome."
p71
aa(lp72
VSo that started the journey.
p73
aVAnd about two years later, about a year later,
p74
aVafter a bunch of organization
p75
aVand a bunch of moving things around,
p76
aVwe'd accomplished a couple things.
p77
aVOne, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies,
p78
aVand we actually got TEMPT a machine
p79
aVthat let him communicate \u2014 a Stephen Hawking machine.
p80
aV(Applause)
p81
aVWhich was awesome.
p82
aVAnd he's seriously one of the funniest \u2014 I call him Yoda,
p83
aVbecause you talk to the guy, you get an email from him,
p84
aVand you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing."
p85
aa(lp86
VThe other thing we did
p87
aVis we flew seven programmers from all over the world \u2014
p88
aVliterally every corner of the world \u2014
p89
aVinto our house.
p90
aVMy wife and kids and I moved to our back garage,
p91
aVand these hackers and programmers
p92
aVand conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.
p93
aVA lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that
p94
aVand that we were going to come back
p95
aVand all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls.
p96
aVBut for over two weeks,
p97
aVwe programmed,
p98
aVwe went to the Venice boardwalk,
p99
aVmy kids got involved,
p100
aVmy dog got involved,
p101
aVand we created this.
p102
aa(lp103
VThis is called the EyeWriter,
p104
aVand you can see the description.
p105
aVThis is a cheap pair of sunglasses
p106
aVthat we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk,
p107
aVsome copper wire
p108
aVand some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.
p109
aVWe took a PS3 camera, hacked it open,
p110
aVmounted it to an LED light,
p111
aVand now there's a device that is free \u2014
p112
aVyou build this yourself, we publish the code for free,
p113
aVyou download the software for free.
p114
aVAnd now we've created a device
p115
aVthat has absolutely no limitations.
p116
aVThere's no insurance company that can say "No."
p117
aVThere's no hospital that can say "No."
p118
aVAnybody who's paralyzed now has access
p119
aVto actually draw or communicate using only their eyes.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
VThank you.
p124
aVThank you guys very much. That was awesome.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo at the end of the two weeks,
p127
aVwe went back to TEMPT's room.
p128
aVI love this picture, because this is someone else's room
p129
aVand that's his room.
p130
aVSo there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling.
p131
aVAnd after over a year of planning,
p132
aVtwo weeks of programming,
p133
aVcarb-fest and all-night sessions,
p134
aVTony drew again for the first time in seven years.
p135
aVAnd this is an amazing picture,
p136
aVbecause this is his life support system,
p137
aVand he's looking over his life support system.
p138
aVWe kicked his bed so that he could see out.
p139
aVAnd we set up a projector
p140
aVon a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital.
p141
aVAnd he drew again for the first time,
p142
aVin front of his family and friends \u2014
p143
aVand you can only imagine
p144
aVwhat the feeling in the parking lot was.
p145
aVThe funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too,
p146
aVso we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VSo at the end of this, he sent us an email,
p151
aVand this is what the email said:
p152
aV"That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years.
p153
aVI feel like I had been held underwater,
p154
aVand someone finally reached down
p155
aVand pulled my head up so I could breathe."
p156
aVIsn't that awesome?
p157
aa(lp158
V(Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
VSo that's kind of our battle cry.
p161
aVThat's what keeps us going and keeps us developing.
p162
aVAnd we've got such a long way to go with this.
p163
aVThis is an amazing device,
p164
aVbut it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch.
p165
aVAnd someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more.
p166
aVSo we're in the process of trying to figure out
p167
aVhow to make it better, faster, stronger.
p168
aa(lp169
VSince that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment.
p170
aVWe've won a bunch of awards.
p171
aVRemember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing.
p172
aVIt's all coming out of our own pockets.
p173
aVSo the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic."
p174
aVArmstrong Twittered about us,
p175
aVand then in December, Time magazine honored us
p176
aVas one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Applause)
p179
aa(lp180
VThe coolest thing about this \u2014
p181
aVand this is what's completing the whole circle \u2014
p182
aVis that in April of this year,
p183
aVat the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles,
p184
aVthere's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets."
p185
aVAnd "Art of the Streets" is going to have
p186
aVpretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene \u2014
p187
aVBanksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS \u2014
p188
aVall of these guys will be there.
p189
aVTEMPT's going to be in the show,
p190
aVwhich is pretty awesome.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VSo basically this is my point:
p195
aVIf you see something that's not possible,
p196
aVmake it possible.
p197
aVEverything in this room wasn't possible \u2014
p198
aVthis stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter \u2014
p199
aVwasn't possible at one point.
p200
aVMake it possible, everyone in this room.
p201
aVI'm not a programmer,
p202
aVnever done anything with ocular recognition technology,
p203
aVbut I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people
p204
aVso that we could make something happen.
p205
aVAnd this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself
p206
aVevery single day
p207
aVwhen you come up with something you feel that needs to be done:
p208
aVif not now, then when? And if not me, then who?
p209
aa(lp210
VThank you guys.

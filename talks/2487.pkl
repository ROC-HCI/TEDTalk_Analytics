VSo I'm an artist,
p5
aVbut a little bit of a peculiar one.
p6
aVI don't paint.
p7
aVI can't draw.
p8
aVMy shop teacher in high school wrote that I was a menace
p9
aVon my report card.
p10
aVYou probably don't really want to see my photographs.
p11
aVBut there is one thing I know how to do:
p12
aVI know how to program a computer.
p13
aVI can code.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd people will tell me that 100 years ago,
p16
aVfolks like me didn't exist,
p17
aVthat it was impossible,
p18
aVthat art made with data is a new thing,
p19
aVit's a product of our age,
p20
aVit's something that's really important
p21
aVto think of as something that's very "now."
p22
aVAnd that's true.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut there is an art form that's been around for a very long time
p25
aVthat's really about using information,
p26
aVabstract information,
p27
aVto make emotionally resonant pieces.
p28
aVAnd it's called music.
p29
aVWe've been making music for tens of thousands of years, right?
p30
aVAnd if you think about what music is \u2014
p31
aVnotes and chords and keys and harmonies and melodies \u2014
p32
aVthese things are algorithms.
p33
aVThese things are systems
p34
aVthat are designed to unfold over time,
p35
aVto make us feel.
p36
aVI came to the arts through music.
p37
aVI was trained as a composer,
p38
aVand about 15 years ago, I started making pieces
p39
aVthat were designed to look at the intersection
p40
aVbetween sound and image,
p41
aVto use an image to unveil a musical structure
p42
aVor to use a sound to show you something interesting
p43
aVabout something that's usually pictorial.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo what you're seeing on the screen is literally being drawn
p46
aVby the musical structure of the musicians onstage,
p47
aVand there's no accident that it looks like a plant,
p48
aVbecause the underlying algorithmic biology of the plant
p49
aVis what informed the musical structure in the first place.
p50
aVSo once you know how to do this, once you know how to code with media,
p51
aVyou can do some pretty cool stuff.
p52
aa(lp53
VThis is a project I did for the Sundance Film Festival.
p54
aVReally simple idea: you take every Academy Award Best Picture,
p55
aVyou speed it up to one minute each
p56
aVand string them all together.
p57
aVAnd so in 75 minutes, I can show you the history of Hollywood cinema.
p58
aVAnd what it really shows you is the history of editing
p59
aVin Hollywood cinema.
p60
aVSo on the left, we've got Casablanca; on the right, we've got Chicago.
p61
aVAnd you can see that Casablanca is a little easier to read.
p62
aVThat's because the average length of a cinematic shot in the 1940s
p63
aVwas 26 seconds,
p64
aVand now it's around six seconds.
p65
aa(lp66
VThis is a project that was inspired
p67
aVby some work that was funded by the US Federal Government
p68
aVin the early 2000s,
p69
aVto look at video footage and find a specific actor in any video.
p70
aVAnd so I repurposed this code to train a system on one person
p71
aVin our culture who would never need to be surveilled in that manner,
p72
aVwhich is Britney Spears.
p73
aVI downloaded 2,000 paparazzi photos of Britney Spears
p74
aVand trained my computer to find her face
p75
aVand her face alone.
p76
aVI can run any footage of her through it and will center her eyes in the frame,
p77
aVand this sort of is a little double commentary
p78
aVabout surveillance in our society.
p79
aVWe are very fraught with anxiety about being watched,
p80
aVbut then we obsess over celebrity.
p81
aa(lp82
VWhat you're seeing on the screen here is a collaboration I did
p83
aVwith an artist named Lián Amaris.
p84
aVWhat she did is very simple to explain and describe,
p85
aVbut very hard to do.
p86
aVShe took 72 minutes of activity,
p87
aVgetting ready for a night out on the town,
p88
aVand stretched it over three days
p89
aVand performed it on a traffic island in slow motion in New York City.
p90
aVI was there, too, with a film crew.
p91
aVWe filmed the whole thing,
p92
aVand then we reversed the process, speeding it up to 72 minutes again,
p93
aVso it looks like she's moving normally
p94
aVand the whole world is flying by.
p95
aa(lp96
VAt a certain point, I figured out
p97
aVthat what I was doing was making portraits.
p98
aVWhen you think about portraiture, you tend to think about stuff like this.
p99
aVThe guy on the left is named Gilbert Stuart.
p100
aVHe's sort of the first real portraitist of the United States.
p101
aVAnd on the right is his portrait of George Washington from 1796.
p102
aVThis is the so-called Lansdowne portrait.
p103
aVAnd if you look at this painting, there's a lot of symbolism, right?
p104
aVWe've got a rainbow out the window. We've got a sword.
p105
aVWe've got a quill on the desk.
p106
aVAll of these things are meant to evoke
p107
aVGeorge Washington as the father of the nation.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis is my portrait of George Washington.
p110
aVAnd this is an eye chart,
p111
aVonly instead of letters, they're words.
p112
aVAnd what the words are is the 66 words
p113
aVin George Washington's State of the Union addresses
p114
aVthat he uses more than any other president.
p115
aVSo "gentlemen" has its own symbolism and its own rhetoric.
p116
aVAnd it's really kind of significant that that's the word he used the most.
p117
aVThis is the eye chart for George W. Bush,
p118
aVwho was president when I made this piece.
p119
aVAnd how you get there,
p120
aVfrom "gentlemen" to "terror" in 43 easy steps,
p121
aVtells us a lot about American history,
p122
aVand gives you a different insight
p123
aVthan you would have looking at a series of paintings.
p124
aVThese pieces provide a history lesson of the United States
p125
aVthrough the political rhetoric of its leaders.
p126
aVRonald Reagan spent a lot of time talking about deficits.
p127
aVBill Clinton spent a lot of time
p128
aVtalking about the century in which he would no longer be president,
p129
aVbut maybe his wife would be.
p130
aVLyndon Johnson was the first President
p131
aVto give his State of the Union addresses on prime-time television;
p132
aVhe began every paragraph with the word "tonight."
p133
aVAnd Richard Nixon, or more accurately, his speechwriter,
p134
aVa guy named William Safire,
p135
aVspent a lot of time thinking about language
p136
aVand making sure that his boss portrayed a rhetoric of honesty.
p137
aa(lp138
VThis project is shown as a series of monolithic sculptures.
p139
aVIt's an outdoor series of light boxes.
p140
aVAnd it's important to note that they're to scale,
p141
aVso if you stand 20 feet back and you can read between those two black lines,
p142
aVyou have 20/20 vision.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VThis is a portrait. And there's a lot of these.
p147
aVThere's a lot of ways to do this with data.
p148
aVI started looking for a way
p149
aVto think about how I can do a more democratic form of portraiture,
p150
aVsomething that's more about my country and how it works.
p151
aVEvery 10 years, we make a census in the United States.
p152
aVWe literally count people,
p153
aVfind out who lives where, what kind of jobs we've got,
p154
aVthe language we speak at home.
p155
aVAnd this is important stuff \u2014 really important stuff.
p156
aVBut it doesn't really tell us who we are.
p157
aVIt doesn't tell us about our dreams and our aspirations.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd so in 2010, I decided to make my own census.
p160
aVAnd I started looking for a corpus of data
p161
aVthat had a lot of descriptions written by ordinary Americans.
p162
aVAnd it turns out
p163
aVthat there is such a corpus of data
p164
aVthat's just sitting there for the taking.
p165
aVIt's called online dating.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo in 2010, I joined 21 different online dating services,
p168
aVas a gay man, a straight man, a gay woman and a straight woman,
p169
aVin every zip code in America
p170
aVand downloaded about 19 million people's dating profiles \u2014
p171
aVabout 20 percent of the adult population of the United States.
p172
aVI have obsessive-compulsive disorder.
p173
aVThis is going to become really freaking obvious. Just go with me.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VSo what I did was I sorted all this stuff by zip code.
p178
aVAnd I looked at word analysis.
p179
aVThese are some dating profiles from 2010
p180
aVwith the word "lonely" highlighted.
p181
aVIf you look at these things topographically,
p182
aVif you imagine dark colors to light colors are more use of the word,
p183
aVyou can see that Appalachia is a pretty lonely place.
p184
aVYou can also see that Nebraska ain't that funny.
p185
aVThis is the kinky map, so what this is showing you
p186
aVis that the women in Alaska need to get together
p187
aVwith the men in southern New Mexico,
p188
aVand have a good time.
p189
aVAnd I have this at a pretty granular level,
p190
aVso I can tell you that the men in the eastern half of Long Island
p191
aVare way more interested in being spanked
p192
aVthan men in the western half of Long Island.
p193
aVThis will be your one takeaway from this whole conference.
p194
aVYou're going to remember that fact for, like, 30 years.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VWhen you bring this down to a cartographic level,
p199
aVyou can make maps and do the same trick I was doing with the eye charts.
p200
aVYou can replace the name of every city in the United States
p201
aVwith the word people use more in that city than anywhere else.
p202
aVIf you've ever dated anyone from Seattle, this makes perfect sense.
p203
aVYou've got "pretty." You've got "heartbreak."
p204
aVYou've got "gig." You've got "cigarette."
p205
aVThey play in a band and they smoke.
p206
aVAnd right above that you can see "email."
p207
aVThat's Redmond, Washington,
p208
aVwhich is the headquarters of the Microsoft Corporation.
p209
aVSome of these you can guess \u2014 so, Los Angeles is "acting"
p210
aVand San Francisco is "gay."
p211
aVSome are a little bit more heartbreaking.
p212
aVIn Baton Rouge, they talk about being curvy;
p213
aVdownstream in New Orleans, they still talk about the flood.
p214
aVFolks in the American capital will say they're interesting.
p215
aVPeople in Baltimore, Maryland, will say they're afraid.
p216
aVThis is New Jersey.
p217
aVI grew up somewhere between "annoying" and "cynical."
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd New York City's number one word is "now,"
p222
aVas in, "Now I'm working as a waiter, but actually I'm an actor."
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VOr, "Now I'm a professor of engineering at NYU, but actually I'm an artist."
p227
aVIf you go upstate, you see "dinosaur."
p228
aVThat's Syracuse.
p229
aVThe best place to eat in Syracuse, New York,
p230
aVis a Hell's Angels barbecue joint called Dinosaur Barbecue.
p231
aVThat's where you would take somebody on a date.
p232
aVI live somewhere between "unconditional" and "midsummer," in Midtown Manhattan.
p233
aVAnd this is gentrified North Brooklyn,
p234
aVso you've got "DJ" and "glamorous" and "hipsters" and "urbane."
p235
aVSo that's maybe a more democratic portrait.
p236
aVAnd the idea was, what if we made red-state and blue-state maps
p237
aVbased on what we want to do on a Friday night?
p238
aa(lp239
VThis is a self-portrait.
p240
aVThis is based on my email,
p241
aVabout 500,000 emails sent over 20 years.
p242
aVYou can think of this as a quantified selfie.
p243
aVSo what I'm doing is running a physics equation
p244
aVbased on my personal data.
p245
aVYou have to imagine everybody I've ever corresponded with.
p246
aVIt started out in the middle and it exploded with a big bang.
p247
aVAnd everybody has gravity to one another,
p248
aVgravity based on how much they've been emailing,
p249
aVwho they've been emailing with.
p250
aVAnd it also does sentimental analysis,
p251
aVso if I say "I love you," you're heavier to me.
p252
aVAnd you attract to my email addresses in the middle,
p253
aVwhich act like mainline stars.
p254
aVAnd all the names are handwritten.
p255
aa(lp256
VSometimes you do this data and this work with real-time data
p257
aVto illuminate a specific problem in a specific city.
p258
aVThis is a Walther PPK 9mm semiautomatic handgun
p259
aVthat was used in a shooting in the French Quarter of New Orleans
p260
aVabout two years ago on Valentine's Day in an argument over parking.
p261
aVThose are my cigarettes.
p262
aVThis is the house where the shooting took place.
p263
aVThis project involved a little bit of engineering.
p264
aVI've got a bike chain rigged up as a cam shaft,
p265
aVwith a computer driving it.
p266
aVThat computer and the mechanism are buried in a box.
p267
aVThe gun's on top welded to a steel plate.
p268
aVThere's a wire going through to the trigger,
p269
aVand the computer in the box is online.
p270
aVIt's listening to the 911 feed of the New Orleans Police Department,
p271
aVso that anytime there's a shooting reported in New Orleans,
p272
aa(lp273
V(Gunshot sound)
p274
aa(lp275
Vthe gun fires.
p276
aVNow, there's a blank, so there's no bullet.
p277
aVThere's big light, big noise
p278
aVand most importantly, there's a casing.
p279
aVThere's about five shootings a day in New Orleans,
p280
aVso over the four months this piece was installed,
p281
aVthe case filled up with bullets.
p282
aVYou guys know what this is \u2014 you call this "data visualization."
p283
aVWhen you do it right, it's illuminating.
p284
aVWhen you do it wrong, it's anesthetizing.
p285
aVIt reduces people to numbers.
p286
aVSo watch out.
p287
aa(lp288
VOne last piece for you.
p289
aVI spent the last summer as the artist in residence
p290
aVfor Times Square.
p291
aVAnd Times Square in New York is literally the crossroads of the world.
p292
aVOne of the things people don't notice about it
p293
aVis it's the most Instagrammed place on Earth.
p294
aVAbout every five seconds, someone commits a selfie
p295
aVin Times Square.
p296
aVThat's 17,000 a day, and I have them all.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VThese are some of them with their eyes centered.
p301
aa(lp302
VEvery civilization,
p303
aVwill use the maximum level of technology available to make art.
p304
aVAnd it's the responsibility of the artist to ask questions
p305
aVabout what that technology means
p306
aVand how it reflects our culture.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo I leave you with this: we're more than numbers.
p309
aVWe're people, and we have dreams and ideas.
p310
aVAnd reducing us to statistics is something that's done
p311
aVat our peril.
p312
aa(lp313
VThank you very much.
p314
aa(lp315

VThis is the Large Hadron Collider.
p5
aVIt's 27 kilometers in circumference.
p6
aVIt's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.
p7
aVOver 10,000 physicists and engineers
p8
aVfrom 85 countries around the world
p9
aVhave come together over several decades
p10
aVto build this machine.
p11
aVWhat we do is we accelerate protons \u2014
p12
aVso, hydrogen nuclei \u2014
p13
aVaround 99.999999
p14
aVpercent the speed of light.
p15
aVRight? At that speed, they go around
p16
aVthat 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second.
p17
aVAnd we collide them with another beam of protons
p18
aVgoing in the opposite direction.
p19
aVWe collide them inside giant detectors.
p20
aa(lp21
VThey're essentially digital cameras.
p22
aVAnd this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.
p23
aVYou get some sense of the size \u2014
p24
aVyou can just see these EU standard-size
p25
aVpeople underneath.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VYou get some sense of the size: 44 meters wide,
p30
aV22 meters in diameter, 7,000 tons.
p31
aVAnd we re-create the conditions that were present
p32
aVless than a billionth of a second after the universe began
p33
aVup to 600 million times a second
p34
aVinside that detector \u2014 immense numbers.
p35
aVAnd if you see those metal bits there \u2014
p36
aVthose are huge magnets that bend
p37
aVelectrically charged particles,
p38
aVso it can measure how fast they're traveling.
p39
aVThis is a picture about a year ago.
p40
aVThose magnets are in there.
p41
aVAnd, again, a EU standard-size, real person,
p42
aVso you get some sense of the scale.
p43
aVAnd it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created,
p44
aVsometime in the summer this year.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd actually, this morning, I got an email
p47
aVsaying that we've just finished, today,
p48
aVbuilding the last piece of ATLAS.
p49
aVSo as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say
p50
aVthat I planned that for TED,
p51
aVbut I didn't. So it's been completed as of today.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Applause)
p54
aa(lp55
VYeah, it's a wonderful achievement.
p56
aVSo, you might be asking, "Why?
p57
aVWhy create the conditions that were present
p58
aVless than a billionth of a second after the universe began?"
p59
aVWell, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious.
p60
aVAnd the aim of particle physics is to understand
p61
aVwhat everything's made of, and how everything sticks together.
p62
aVAnd by everything I mean, of course,
p63
aVme and you, the Earth, the Sun,
p64
aVthe 100 billion suns in our galaxy
p65
aVand the 100 billion galaxies
p66
aVin the observable universe.
p67
aVAbsolutely everything.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow you might say, "Well, OK, but why not just look at it?
p70
aVYou know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me."
p71
aVWell, we found that as you look back in time,
p72
aVthe universe gets hotter and hotter,
p73
aVdenser and denser, and simpler and simpler.
p74
aVNow, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that,
p75
aVbut that seems to be the case.
p76
aVSo, way back in the early times of the universe,
p77
aVwe believe it was very simple and understandable.
p78
aVAll this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things \u2014
p79
aVhuman brains \u2014 are a property of an old
p80
aVand cold and complicated universe.
p81
aVBack at the start, in the first billionth of a second,
p82
aVwe believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.
p83
aa(lp84
VIt's almost like ...
p85
aVimagine a snowflake in your hand,
p86
aVand you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated,
p87
aVbeautiful object. But as you heat it up,
p88
aVit'll melt into a pool of water,
p89
aVand you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made
p90
aVof H20, water.
p91
aVSo it's in that same sense that we look back in time
p92
aVto understand what the universe is made of.
p93
aVAnd, as of today, it's made of these things.
p94
aVJust 12 particles of matter,
p95
aVstuck together by four forces of nature.
p96
aVThe quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons
p97
aVthat make up the atomic nuclei in your body.
p98
aVThe electron \u2014 the thing that goes around
p99
aVthe atomic nucleus \u2014
p100
aVheld around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force
p101
aVthat's carried by this thing, the photon.
p102
aVThe quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force,
p105
aVprobably the least familiar.
p106
aVBut, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.
p107
aVAnd when the sun shines, you get copious quantities
p108
aVof these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.
p109
aVActually, if you just look at your thumbnail \u2014
p110
aVabout a square centimeter \u2014
p111
aVthere are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second
p112
aVfrom the sun, passing
p113
aVthrough every square centimeter of your body.
p114
aVBut you don't feel them, because the weak force
p115
aVis correctly named \u2014
p116
aVvery short range and very weak,
p117
aVso they just fly through you.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd these particles have been discovered
p120
aVover the last century, pretty much.
p121
aVThe first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897,
p122
aVand the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino,
p123
aVin the year 2000. Actually just \u2014
p124
aVI was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country,
p125
aVAmerica, isn't it?
p126
aVJust up the road.
p127
aVRelative to the universe, it's just up the road.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VSo, this thing was discovered in the year 2000,
p132
aVso it's a relatively recent picture.
p133
aVOne of the wonderful things, actually, I find,
p134
aVis that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.
p135
aVYou know, they're a step in size
p136
aVfrom the entire observable universe.
p137
aVSo, 100 billion galaxies,
p138
aV13.7 billion light years away \u2014
p139
aVa step in size from that to Monterey, actually,
p140
aVis about the same as from Monterey to these things.
p141
aVAbsolutely, exquisitely minute,
p142
aVand yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo, one of my most illustrious forebears
p145
aVat Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford,
p146
aVdiscoverer of the atomic nucleus,
p147
aVonce said, "All science is either physics
p148
aVor stamp collecting."
p149
aVNow, I don't think he meant to insult
p150
aVthe rest of science,
p151
aValthough he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VBut what he meant was that what we've done, really,
p156
aVis stamp collect there.
p157
aVOK, we've discovered the particles,
p158
aVbut unless you understand the underlying
p159
aVreason for that pattern \u2014 you know, why it's built the way it is \u2014
p160
aVreally you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.
p161
aVFortunately, we have
p162
aVprobably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century
p163
aVthat underpins that pattern.
p164
aVIt's the Newton's laws, if you want,
p165
aVof particle physics.
p166
aVIt's called the standard model \u2014 beautifully simple mathematical equation.
p167
aVYou could stick it on the front of a T-shirt,
p168
aVwhich is always the sign of elegance.
p169
aVThis is it.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VI've been a little disingenuous, because I've expanded it out
p174
aVin all its gory detail.
p175
aVThis equation, though, allows you to calculate everything \u2014
p176
aVother than gravity \u2014 that happens in the universe.
p177
aVSo, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together \u2014
p178
aVin principle, you've got a big enough computer \u2014
p179
aVwhy DNA is the shape it is.
p180
aVIn principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut there's a problem.
p183
aVCan anyone see what it is?
p184
aVA bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.
p185
aVI'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.
p186
aVBasically, each of these terms
p187
aVrefers to some of the particles.
p188
aVSo those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.
p189
aVThese carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.
p190
aVBut there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.
p191
aVRight, H.
p192
aVH stands for Higgs particle.
p193
aVHiggs particles have not been discovered.
p194
aVBut they're necessary: they're necessary
p195
aVto make that mathematics work.
p196
aVSo all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do
p197
aVwith that wonderful equation
p198
aVwouldn't be possible without an extra bit.
p199
aVSo it's a prediction:
p200
aVa prediction of a new particle.
p201
aa(lp202
VWhat does it do?
p203
aVWell, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.
p204
aVAnd back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money
p205
aVfor the LHC from the U.K. government,
p206
aVMargaret Thatcher, at the time, said,
p207
aV"If you guys can explain, in language
p208
aVa politician can understand,
p209
aVwhat the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.
p210
aVI want to know what this Higgs particle does."
p211
aVAnd we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.
p212
aVWell, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.
p213
aVAnd the picture is that the whole universe \u2014
p214
aVand that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you \u2014
p215
aVthe whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.
p216
aVHiggs particles, if you will.
p217
aa(lp218
VThe analogy is that these people in a room
p219
aVare the Higgs particles.
p220
aVNow when a particle moves through the universe,
p221
aVit can interact with these Higgs particles.
p222
aVBut imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.
p223
aVThen everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly,
p224
aVessentially at the speed of light. They're massless.
p225
aVAnd imagine someone incredibly important
p226
aVand popular and intelligent
p227
aVwalks into the room.
p228
aVThey're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.
p229
aVIt's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.
p230
aVAnd that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.
p231
aVThe picture is that the electrons and the quarks
p232
aVin your body and in the universe that we see around us
p233
aVare heavy, in a sense, and massive,
p234
aVbecause they're surrounded by Higgs particles.
p235
aVThey're interacting with the Higgs field.
p236
aa(lp237
VIf that picture's true,
p238
aVthen we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.
p239
aVIf it's not true \u2014 because it's quite a convoluted mechanism,
p240
aValthough it's the simplest we've been able to think of \u2014
p241
aVthen whatever does the job of the Higgs particles
p242
aVwe know have to turn up
p243
aVat the LHC.
p244
aVSo, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.
p245
aVI'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.
p246
aVActually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but \u2014
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aVanyway.
p249
aVSo that's one thing.
p250
aVThat's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.
p251
aa(lp252
VThere are many other things. You've heard
p253
aVmany of the big problems in particle physics.
p254
aVOne of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy.
p255
aVThere's another issue,
p256
aVwhich is that the forces in nature \u2014 it's quite beautiful, actually \u2014
p257
aVseem, as you go back in time,
p258
aVthey seem to change in strength.
p259
aVWell, they do change in strength.
p260
aVSo, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together,
p261
aVgets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.
p262
aVThe strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together,
p263
aVgets weaker. And what you see is the standard model \u2014
p264
aVyou can calculate how these change \u2014 is the forces,
p265
aVthe three forces, other than gravity,
p266
aValmost seem to come together at one point.
p267
aVIt's almost as if there was one beautiful
p268
aVkind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.
p269
aVBut they just miss.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow there's a theory called super-symmetry,
p272
aVwhich doubles the number of particles in the standard model,
p273
aVwhich, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.
p274
aVBut actually, with this theory,
p275
aVwe find that the forces of nature
p276
aVdo seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang \u2014
p277
aVabsolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that,
p278
aVbut it seems to do it.
p279
aVAlso, those super-symmetric particles
p280
aVare very strong candidates for the dark matter.
p281
aVSo a very compelling theory
p282
aVthat's really mainstream physics.
p283
aVAnd if I was to put money on it, I would put money on \u2014
p284
aVin a very unscientific way \u2014 that
p285
aVthat these things would also crop up at the LHC.
p286
aVMany other things that the LHC could discover.
p287
aa(lp288
VBut in the last few minutes, I just want to give you
p289
aVa different perspective
p290
aVof what I think \u2014 what particle physics
p291
aVreally means to me \u2014 particle physics and cosmology.
p292
aVAnd that's that I think it's given us a wonderful
p293
aVnarrative \u2014 almost a creation story,
p294
aVif you'd like \u2014 about the universe,
p295
aVfrom modern science over the last few decades.
p296
aVAnd I'd say that it deserves,
p297
aVin the spirit of Wade Davis' talk,
p298
aVto be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories
p299
aVof the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.
p300
aVThis is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.
p301
aa(lp302
VThe story goes like this: we know that
p303
aVthe universe began 13.7 billion years ago,
p304
aVin an immensely hot, dense state,
p305
aVmuch smaller than a single atom.
p306
aVIt began to expand about
p307
aVa million, billion, billion, billion billionth
p308
aVof a second \u2014 I think I got that right \u2014 after the Big Bang.
p309
aVGravity separated away from the other forces.
p310
aVThe universe then underwent
p311
aVan exponential expansion called inflation.
p312
aVIn about the first billionth of a second or so,
p313
aVthe Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks
p314
aVand the gluons and the electrons
p315
aVthat make us up got mass.
p316
aVThe universe continued to expand and cool.
p317
aVAfter about a few minutes,
p318
aVthere was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.
p319
aVThe universe was about 75 percent hydrogen,
p320
aV25 percent helium. It still is today.
p321
aa(lp322
VIt continued to expand
p323
aVabout 300 million years.
p324
aVThen light began to travel through the universe.
p325
aVIt was big enough to be transparent to light,
p326
aVand that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background
p327
aVthat George Smoot described
p328
aVas looking at the face of God.
p329
aVAfter about 400 million years, the first stars formed,
p330
aVand that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook
p331
aVinto the heavier elements.
p332
aVSo the elements of life \u2014
p333
aVcarbon, and oxygen and iron,
p334
aVall the elements that we need to make us up \u2014
p335
aVwere cooked in those first generations of stars,
p336
aVwhich then ran out of fuel, exploded,
p337
aVthrew those elements back into the universe.
p338
aVThey then re-collapsed into another generation
p339
aVof stars and planets.
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created
p342
aVin that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen
p343
aVto form water, liquid water on the surface.
p344
aVOn at least one, and maybe only one of those planets,
p345
aVprimitive life evolved,
p346
aVwhich evolved over millions of years into
p347
aVthings that walked upright and left footprints
p348
aVabout three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania,
p349
aVand eventually
p350
aVleft a footprint on another world.
p351
aVAnd built this civilization,
p352
aVthis wonderful picture,
p353
aVthat turned the darkness into light,
p354
aVand you can see the civilization from space.
p355
aVAs one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said,
p356
aVthese are the things \u2014 and actually, not only these,
p357
aVbut I was looking around \u2014 these are the things,
p358
aVlike Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik,
p359
aVand DNA, and literature and science \u2014
p360
aVthese are the things that hydrogen atoms do
p361
aVwhen given 13.7 billion years.
p362
aa(lp363
VAbsolutely remarkable.
p364
aVAnd, the laws of physics. Right?
p365
aVSo, the right laws of physics \u2014
p366
aVthey're beautifully balanced.
p367
aVIf the weak force had been a little bit different,
p368
aVthen carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable
p369
aVinside the hearts of stars,
p370
aVand there would be none of that in the universe.
p371
aVAnd I think that's
p372
aVa wonderful and significant story.
p373
aV50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story,
p374
aVbecause we didn't know it.
p375
aVIt makes me really feel that
p376
aVthat civilization \u2014
p377
aVwhich, as I say, if you believe
p378
aVthe scientific creation story,
p379
aVhas emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics,
p380
aVand a few hydrogen atoms \u2014
p381
aVthen I think, to me anyway,
p382
aVit makes me feel incredibly valuable.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo that's the LHC.
p385
aVThe LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer,
p386
aVgoing to write the next chapter of that book.
p387
aVAnd I'm certainly looking forward with
p388
aVimmense excitement to it being turned on.
p389
aVThanks.

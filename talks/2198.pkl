VAn 18-year-old, African-American male joined the United States Air Force
p5
aVand was assigned to Mountain Home  Air Force Base
p6
aVand was a part of the air police squadron.
p7
aVUpon first arriving there, the first goal that I had
p8
aVwas for me to identify an apartment,
p9
aVso I could bring my wife  and my new baby, Melanie,
p10
aVout to join me in Idaho.
p11
aa(lp12
VI immediately went to  the personnel office,
p13
aVand talking with the guys in personnel,
p14
aVthey said, "Hey, no problem finding  an apartment in Mountain Home, Idaho.
p15
aVThe people down there love us  because they know if they have an airman
p16
aVwho is coming in to rent  one of their apartments,
p17
aVthey'll always get their money."
p18
aVAnd that was a really important thing.
p19
aVHe said, "So here is a list  of people that you can call,
p20
aVand then they will then allow you  to select the apartment that you want."
p21
aVSo I got the list; I made the call.
p22
aVThe lady answered on the other end and I told her what I wanted.
p23
aVShe said, "Oh, great you called.
p24
aVWe have four or five apartments available right now."
p25
aVShe said, "Do you want  a one-bedroom or two-bedroom?"
p26
aVThen she said, "Let's not talk about that.
p27
aVJust come on down,  select the apartment that you want.
p28
aVWe'll sign the contract
p29
aVand you'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away."
p30
aa(lp31
VSo I was excited.
p32
aVI jumped in my car. I went downtown and knocked on the door.
p33
aVWhen I knocked on the door,  the woman came to the door,
p34
aVand she looked at me, and she said, "Can I help you?"
p35
aVI said, "Yes, I'm the person  who called about the apartments.
p36
aVI was just coming down  to make my selection."
p37
aVShe said, "You know what?  I'm really sorry,
p38
aVbut my husband rented those apartments and didn't tell me about them."
p39
aVI said, "You mean he rented  all five of them in one hour?"
p40
aVShe didn't give me a response, and what she said was this:
p41
aVShe said, "Why don't you leave your number,
p42
aVand if we have some openings,  I'll give you a call?"
p43
aVNeedless to say, I did not get a call from her.
p44
aVNor did I get any responses  from the other people
p45
aVthat they gave me on the list where I could get apartments.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo as a result of that, and feeling rejected,
p48
aVI went back to the base, and I talked to the squadron commander.
p49
aVHis name was McDow, Major McDow.
p50
aVI said, "Major McDow, I need your help."
p51
aVI told him what happened,  and here's what he said to me:
p52
aVHe said, "James, I would love to help you.
p53
aVBut you know the problem:
p54
aVWe can't make people rent to folks  that they don't want to rent to.
p55
aVAnd besides, we have a great relationship with people in the community
p56
aVand we really don't want to damage that."
p57
aVHe said, "So maybe this is  what you should do.
p58
aVWhy don't you let your family stay home,
p59
aVbecause you do know  that you get a 30-day leave.
p60
aVSo once a year,
p61
aVyou can go home to your family, spend 30 days and then come on back."
p62
aa(lp63
VNeedless to say, that didn't resonate for me.
p64
aVSo after leaving him,  I went back to personnel,
p65
aVand talking to the clerk,
p66
aVhe said, "Jim, I think I have a  solution for you.
p67
aVThere's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer.
p68
aVIf you noticed, in Mountain Home,
p69
aVthere are trailer parks and trailers all over the place.
p70
aVYou can buy his trailer, and you'd probably get a really good deal
p71
aVbecause he wants to get out of town as soon as possible.
p72
aVAnd that would take care of your problem,
p73
aVand that would provide  the solution for you."
p74
aVSo I immediately jumped in my car, went downtown, saw the trailer \u2014
p75
aVit was a small trailer,
p76
aVbut under the circumstances,
p77
aVI figured that was the  best thing that I could do.
p78
aVSo I bought the trailer.
p79
aVAnd then I asked him,  "Can I just leave the trailer here,
p80
aVand that would take care  of all my problems,
p81
aVI wouldn't have to find another trailer park?"
p82
aVHe said, "Before I say yes to that,  I need to check with management."
p83
aVSo I get back to the base,
p84
aVhe called me back and management said,
p85
aV"No, you can't leave the trailer here
p86
aVbecause we had promised that slot to some other people."
p87
aVAnd that was strange to me
p88
aVbecause there were several  other slots that were open,
p89
aVbut it just so happened that he  had promised that slot to someone else.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo, what I did \u2014
p92
aVand he said, "You shouldn't worry, Jim, because there are a lot of trailer parks."
p93
aVSo I put out another exhaustive list of going to trailer parks.
p94
aVI went to one after another,  after another.
p95
aVAnd I got the same kind of rejection there
p96
aVthat I received when I was looking  for the apartment.
p97
aVAnd as a result, the kind of comments that they made to me,
p98
aVin addition to saying that they didn't have any slots open,
p99
aVone person said, "Jim, the reason why we can't rent to you,
p100
aVwe already have a Negro family in the trailer park."
p101
aVHe said, "And it's not me,  because I like you people."
p102
aV(Laughs)
p103
aVAnd that's what I did, too. I chuckled, too.
p104
aVHe said, "But here's the problem:
p105
aVIf I let you in, the other tenants  will move out
p106
aVand I can't afford to take that kind of a hit."
p107
aVHe said, "I just can't rent to you."
p108
aa(lp109
VEven though that was discouraging, it didn't stop me.
p110
aVI kept looking,
p111
aVand I looked at the far end  of the town in Mountain Home,
p112
aVand there was a small trailer park.
p113
aVI mean, a really small trailer park.
p114
aVIt didn't have any paved roads in it,
p115
aVit didn't have the concrete slabs,
p116
aVit didn't have fencing
p117
aVto portion off your trailer slot  from other trailer slots.
p118
aVIt didn't have a laundry facility.
p119
aVBut the conclusion I reached  at that moment
p120
aVwas that I didn't have  a lot of other options.
p121
aVSo I called my wife, and I said, "We're going to make this one work."
p122
aVAnd we moved into it
p123
aVand we became homeowners in Mountain Home, Idaho.
p124
aVAnd of course, eventually things settled down.
p125
aa(lp126
VFour years after that, I received papers to move from Mountain Home, Idaho
p127
aVto a place called Goose Bay, Labrador.
p128
aVWe won't even talk about that. It was another great location. (Laughter)
p129
aVSo my challenge then was to get my family  from Mountain Home, Idaho
p130
aVto Sharon, Pennsylvania.
p131
aVThat wasn't a problem because we had just purchased a brand-new automobile.
p132
aVMy mother called  and said she'll fly out.
p133
aVShe'll be with us as we drive, she'll help us manage the children.
p134
aVSo she came out, her and Alice  put a lot of food together for the trip.
p135
aa(lp136
VThat morning, we left at about 5 a.m.
p137
aVGreat trip, having a great time,  good conversation.
p138
aVSomewhere around 6:30, 7 o'clock, we got a little bit tired,
p139
aVand we said, "Why don't we get a motel so that we can rest
p140
aVand then have an early start in the morning?"
p141
aVSo we were looking at a number  of the motels as we drove down the road,
p142
aVand we saw one, it was a great big, bright flashing light that said,
p143
aV"Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacanies."
p144
aVSo we stopped in.
p145
aVThey were in the parking lot,  I went inside.
p146
aVWhen I walked inside,
p147
aVthe lady was just finishing up  one contract with some folks,
p148
aVsome other people  were coming in behind me.
p149
aVAnd so I walked to the counter,
p150
aVand she said, "How can I help you?"
p151
aVI said, "I would like to get a motel  for the evening for my family."
p152
aVShe said, "You know, I'm really sorry, I just rented the last one.
p153
aVWe will not have any more  until the morning."
p154
aVShe said, "But if you go down the road about an hour, 45 minutes,
p155
aVthere's another trailer park down there."
p156
aVI said, "Yeah, but you still have the  'Vacancies' light on, and it's flashing."
p157
aVShe said, "Oh, I forgot."
p158
aVAnd she reached over  and turned the light off.
p159
aVShe looked at me and I looked at her.
p160
aVThere were other people in the room.
p161
aVShe kind of looked at them. No one said anything.
p162
aVSo I just got the hint and I left, and went outside to the parking lot.
p163
aVAnd I told my mother and I told my wife and also Melanie, and I said,
p164
aV"It looks like we're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road
p165
aVto be able to sleep tonight."
p166
aVAnd we did drive down the road,
p167
aVbut just before we took off  and pulled out of the parking lot,
p168
aVguess what happened?
p169
aVThe light came back on.
p170
aVAnd it said, "Vacancies,  Vacancies, Vacancies."
p171
aVWe were able to find a nice place.
p172
aVIt wasn't our preference, but it was secure and it was clean.
p173
aVAnd so we had a great sleep that night.
p174
aa(lp175
VThe piece that's important about that
p176
aVis that we had similar kinds of experiences
p177
aVfrom Idaho all the way through  to Pennsylvania,
p178
aVwhere we were rejected from hotels,  motels and restaurants.
p179
aVBut we made it to Pennsylvania.
p180
aVWe got the family settled. Everyone was glad to see the kids.
p181
aVI jumped on a plane and shot off to Goose Bay, Labrador,
p182
aVwhich is another story, right?
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VHere it is, 53 years later,
p186
aVI now have nine grandchildren,  two great-grandchildren.
p187
aVFive of the grandchildren are boys.
p188
aVI have master's, Ph.D., undergrad, one in medical school.
p189
aVI have a couple that are trending.
p190
aVThey're almost there but not quite. (Laughter)
p191
aVI have one who has been  in college now for eight years.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aVHe doesn't have a degree yet,  but he wants to be a comedian.
p194
aVSo we're just trying to get him to stay in school.
p195
aVBecause you never know,
p196
aVjust because you're funny at home, does not make you a comedian, right?
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aVBut the thing about it,  they're all good kids \u2014
p199
aVno drugs, no babies  in high school, no crime.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo with that being the backdrop,
p202
aVI was sitting in my TV room watching TV,
p203
aVand they were talking about Ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on.
p204
aVAnd all of a sudden, one of the news  commentators got on the air and she said,
p205
aV"In the last three months,
p206
aVeight unarmed African-American males
p207
aVhave been killed by police, white homeowners, or white citizens."
p208
aVFor some reason, at that moment it just all hit me.
p209
aVI said, "What is it? It is so insane.
p210
aVWhat is the hatred that's causing people  to do these kinds of things?"
p211
aa(lp212
VJust then, one of my grandsons called.
p213
aVHe said, "Granddad, did you hear what they said on TV?"
p214
aVI said, "Yes, I did."
p215
aVHe said, "I'm just so confused.
p216
aVWe do everything we do, but it seems that driving while black,
p217
aVwalking while black, talking while black, it's just dangerous.
p218
aVWhat can we do? We do everything that you told us to do.
p219
aVWhen stopped by the police,
p220
aVwe place both hands on the steering wheel at the 12 o'clock position.
p221
aVIf asked to get identification,
p222
aVwe tell them, 'I am slowly reaching over  into the glove compartment to get my I.D.'
p223
aVWhen pulled out of the car to be searched,
p224
aVwhen laid on the ground to be searched,
p225
aVwhen our trunks are opened to be searched,
p226
aVwe don't push back, we don't challenge because we know, you've told us,
p227
aV'Don't you challenge the police.
p228
aVAfter it's over, call us and we'll be the ones to challenge."
p229
aa(lp230
VHe said, "And this is the piece  that really bugs me:
p231
aVOur white friends, our buddies, we kind of hang together.
p232
aVWhen they hear about these kinds of things happening to us, they say,
p233
aV'Why do you take it?
p234
aVYou need to push back. You need to challenge.
p235
aVYou need to ask them  for their identification.'"
p236
aVAnd here's what the boys have been taught to tell them:
p237
aV"We know that you can do that, but please do not do that
p238
aVwhile we're in the car
p239
aVbecause the consequences for you are significantly different
p240
aVthan the consequences for us."
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd so as a grandparent,  what do I tell my grandsons?
p243
aVHow do I keep them safe? How do I keep them alive?
p244
aVAs a result of this, people have come to me and said,
p245
aV"Jim, are you angry?"
p246
aVAnd my response to that is this:
p247
aV"I don't have the luxury of being angry,
p248
aVand I also know the consequences  of being enraged."
p249
aa(lp250
VSo therefore, the only thing that I can do
p251
aVis take my collective intellect and my energy and my ideas and my experiences
p252
aVand dedicate myself to challenge,  at any point in time,
p253
aVanything that looks  like it might be racist.
p254
aVSo the first thing I have  to do is to educate,
p255
aVthe second thing I have to do  is to unveil racism,
p256
aVand the last thing I need to do is do everything within my power
p257
aVto eradicate racism in my lifetime by any means necessary.
p258
aa(lp259
VThe second thing I do is this:
p260
aVI want to appeal to Americans.
p261
aVI want to appeal to their humanity, to their dignity,
p262
aVto their civic pride and ownership
p263
aVto be able to not react to these  heinous crimes in an adverse manner.
p264
aVBut instead, to elevate your level of societal knowledge,
p265
aVyour level of societal awareness and societal consciousness
p266
aVto then collectively come together, all of us come together,
p267
aVto make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity,
p268
aVany kind of insanity that makes it  okay to kill unarmed people,
p269
aVregardless of their ethnicity,
p270
aVregardless of their race,
p271
aVregardless of their diversity makeup.
p272
aa(lp273
VWe have to challenge that. It doesn't make any sense.
p274
aVThe only way I think we can do that is through a collective.
p275
aVWe need to have black and white  and Asian and Hispanic
p276
aVjust to step forward and say,
p277
aV"We are not going to accept  that kind of behavior anymore."

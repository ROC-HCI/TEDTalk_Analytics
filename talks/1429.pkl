VIt's a great honor to be here.
p5
aVIt's a great honor to be here talking about cities,
p6
aVtalking about the future of cities.
p7
aVIt's great to be here as a mayor.
p8
aVI really do believe that mayors have the political position
p9
aVto really change people's lives.
p10
aVThat's the place to be.
p11
aVAnd it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio.
p12
aVRio's a beautiful city,
p13
aVa vibrant place, special place.
p14
aVActually, you're looking at a guy
p15
aVwho has the best job in the world.
p16
aVAnd I really wanted to share with you
p17
aVa very special moment of my life
p18
aVand the history of the city of Rio.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Video) Announcer: And now, ladies and gentlemen,
p21
aVthe envelope containing the result.
p22
aVJacques Rogge: I have the honor to announce
p23
aVthat the games of the 31st Olympiad
p24
aVare awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro.
p25
aV(Cheering)
p26
aa(lp27
VEP: Okay, that's very touching, very emotional,
p28
aVbut it was not easy to get there.
p29
aVActually it was a very hard challenge.
p30
aVWe had to beat the European monarchy.
p31
aVThis is Juan Carlos, king of Spain.
p32
aVWe had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology.
p33
aVWe had to beat the most powerful man in the world
p34
aVdefending his own city.
p35
aVSo it was not easy at all.
p36
aVAnd actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago
p37
aVthat I think fits perfectly to the situation
p38
aVof Rio winning the Olympic bid.
p39
aVWe really showed that, yes, we can.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd really, this is the reason I came here tonight.
p42
aVI came here tonight to tell you
p43
aVthat things can be done,
p44
aVthat you don't have always to be rich or powerful
p45
aVto get things on the way,
p46
aVthat cities are a great challenge.
p47
aVIt's a difficult task to deal with cities.
p48
aVBut with some original ways
p49
aVof getting things done,
p50
aVwith some basic commandments,
p51
aVyou can really get cities
p52
aVto be a great, great place to live.
p53
aVI want you all to imagine Rio.
p54
aVYou probably think about a city full of energy,
p55
aVa vibrant city full of green.
p56
aVAnd nobody showed that better
p57
aVthan Carlos Saldanha in last year's "Rio."
p58
aa(lp59
V(Music)
p60
aV(Video) Bird: This is incredible.
p61
aV(Music)
p62
aa(lp63
VEP: Okay, some parts of Rio are pretty much like that,
p64
aVbut it's not like that everywhere.
p65
aVWe're like every big city in the world.
p66
aVWe've got lots of people,
p67
aVpollution, cars, concrete, lots of concrete.
p68
aVThese pictures I'm showing here,
p69
aVthey are some pictures from Madureira.
p70
aVIt's like the heart of the suburb in Rio.
p71
aVAnd I want to use an example of Rio
p72
aVthat we're doing in Madureira, in this region,
p73
aVto see what we should think as our first commandment.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo every time you see a concrete jungle like that,
p76
aVwhat you've got to do is find open spaces.
p77
aVIf you don't have open spaces,
p78
aVyou've got to go there and open spaces.
p79
aVSo go inside these open spaces
p80
aVand make it that people can get inside
p81
aVand use those spaces.
p82
aVThis is going to be the third largest park in Rio
p83
aVby June this year.
p84
aVIt's going to be a place where people can meet,
p85
aVwhere you can put nature.
p86
aVThe temperature's going to drop two, three degrees centigrade.
p87
aVSo the first commandment
p88
aVI want to leave you tonight
p89
aVis, a city of the future
p90
aVhas to be environmentally friendly.
p91
aVEvery time you think of a city,
p92
aVyou've got to think green.
p93
aVYou've got to think green and green.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you.
p96
aVLet's think that cities are made of people,
p97
aVlots of people together.
p98
aVcities are packed with people.
p99
aVSo how do you move these people around?
p100
aVWhen you have 3.5 billion people living in cities \u2014
p101
aVby 2050, it's going to be 6 billion people.
p102
aVSo every time you think about moving these people around,
p103
aVyou think about high-capacity transportation.
p104
aVBut there is a problem.
p105
aVHigh-capacity transportation means
p106
aVspending lots and lots of money.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo what I'm going to show here
p109
aVis something that was already presented in TED
p110
aVby the former mayor of Curitiba
p111
aVwho created that, a city in Brazil, Jaime Lerner.
p112
aVAnd it's something that we're doing, again, lots in Rio.
p113
aVIt's the BRT, the Bus Rapid Transit.
p114
aVSo you get a bus. It's a simple bus that everybody knows.
p115
aVYou transform it inside as a train car.
p116
aVYou use separate lanes, dedicated lanes.
p117
aVThe contractors, they don't like that.
p118
aVYou don't have to dig deep down underground.
p119
aVYou can build nice stations.
p120
aVThis is actually a station that we're doing in Rio.
p121
aVAgain, you don't have to dig deep down underground
p122
aVto make a station like that.
p123
aVThis station has the same comfort, the same features
p124
aVas a subway station.
p125
aVA kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway.
p126
aVSo spending much less money and doing it much faster,
p127
aVyou can really change the way people move.
p128
aa(lp129
VThis is a map of Rio.
p130
aVAll the lines, the colored lines you see there,
p131
aVit's our high-capacity transportation network.
p132
aVIn this present time today,
p133
aVwe only carry 18 percent of our population
p134
aVin high-capacity transportation.
p135
aVWith the BRTs we're doing,
p136
aVagain, the cheapest and fastest way,
p137
aVwe're going to move to 63 percent of the population
p138
aVbeing carried by high-capacity transportation.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo remember what I said:
p141
aVYou don't always have to be rich or powerful
p142
aVto get things done.
p143
aVYou can find original ways to get things done.
p144
aVSo the second commandment I want to leave you tonight
p145
aVis, a city of the future
p146
aVhas to deal with mobility and integration
p147
aVof its people.
p148
aa(lp149
VMoving to the third commandment.
p150
aVAnd this is the most controversial one.
p151
aVIt has to do with the favelas, the slums \u2014
p152
aVwhatever you call it, there are different names all over the world.
p153
aVBut the point we want to make here tonight
p154
aVis, favelas are not always a problem.
p155
aVI mean, favelas can sometimes
p156
aVreally be a solution,
p157
aVif you deal with them,
p158
aVif you put public policy inside the favelas.
p159
aVLet me just show a map of Rio again.
p160
aVRio has 6.3 million inhabitants \u2014
p161
aVMore than 20 percent, 1.4 million, live in the favelas.
p162
aVAll these red parts are favelas.
p163
aVSo you see, they are spread all over the city.
p164
aVThis is a typical view of a favela in Rio.
p165
aVYou see the contrast between the rich and poor.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo I want to make two points here tonight about favelas.
p168
aVThe first one is,
p169
aVyou can change from what I call a [vicious] circle
p170
aVto a virtual circle.
p171
aVBut what you've got to do to get that
p172
aVis you've got to go inside the favelas,
p173
aVbring in the basic services \u2014
p174
aVmainly education and health \u2014 with high quality.
p175
aVI'm going to give a fast example here.
p176
aVThis was an old building in a favela in Rio \u2014
p177
aV[unclear favela name] \u2014
p178
aVthat we just transformed into a primary school,
p179
aVwith high quality.
p180
aVThis is primary assistance in health
p181
aVthat we built inside a favela,
p182
aVagain, with high quality.
p183
aVWe call it a family clinic.
p184
aVSo the first point is bring basic services
p185
aVinside the favelas
p186
aVwith high quality.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe second point I want to make about the favelas
p189
aVis, you've got to open spaces in the favela.
p190
aVBring infrastructure
p191
aVto the favelas, to the slums, wherever you are.
p192
aVRio has the aim, by 2020,
p193
aVto have all its favelas completely urbanized.
p194
aVAnother example, this was completely packed with houses,
p195
aVand then we built this, what we call, a knowledge square.
p196
aVThis is a place with high technology
p197
aVwhere the kids that live in a poor house next to this place
p198
aVcan go inside and have access to all technology.
p199
aVWe even built a theater there \u2014 3D movie.
p200
aVAnd this is the kind of change you can get for that.
p201
aVAnd by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize,
p202
aVwhich is this great laugh
p203
aVfrom a kid that lives in the favela.
p204
aVSo the third commandment I want to leave here tonight
p205
aVis, a city of the future
p206
aVhas to be socially integrated.
p207
aVYou cannot deal with a city
p208
aVif it's not socially integrated.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut moving to our fourth commandment,
p211
aVI really wouldn't be here tonight.
p212
aVBetween November and May, Rio's completely packed.
p213
aVWe just had last week Carnivale.
p214
aVIt was great. It was lots of fun.
p215
aVWe have New Year's Eve.
p216
aVThere's like two million people on Copacabana Beach.
p217
aVWe have problems.
p218
aVWe fight floods, tropical rains at this time of the year.
p219
aVYou can imagine how people get happy with me
p220
aVwatching these kinds of scenes.
p221
aVWe have problems with the tropical rains.
p222
aVAlmost every year
p223
aVwe have these landslides, which are terrible.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut the reason I could come here
p226
aVis because of that.
p227
aVThis was something we did with IBM
p228
aVthat's a little bit more than a year old.
p229
aVIt's what we call the Operations Center of Rio.
p230
aVAnd I wanted to show that I can govern my city, using technology,
p231
aVfrom here, from Long Beach,
p232
aVso I got here last night and I know everything.
p233
aVWe're going to speak now to the Operations Center.
p234
aVThis is Osorio,
p235
aVhe's our secretary of urban affairs.
p236
aVSo Osorio, good to be there with you.
p237
aVI've already told the people
p238
aVthat we have tropical rain this time of year.
p239
aVSo how's the weather in Rio now?
p240
aa(lp241
VOsorio: The weather is fine. We have fair weather today.
p242
aVLet me get you our weather satellite radar.
p243
aVYou see just a little bit of moisture around the city.
p244
aVAbsolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather,
p245
aVtoday and in the next few days.
p246
aa(lp247
VEP: Okay, how's the traffic?
p248
aVWe, at this time of year, get lots of traffic jams.
p249
aVPeople get mad at the mayor. So how's the traffic tonight?
p250
aa(lp251
VOsario: Well traffic tonight is fine.
p252
aVLet me get you one of our 8,000 buses.
p253
aVA live transmission in downtown Rio for you, Mr. Mayor.
p254
aVYou see, the streets are clear.
p255
aVNow it's 11:00 pm in Rio.
p256
aVNothing of concern in terms of traffic.
p257
aVI'll get to you now the incidents of the day.
p258
aVWe had heavy traffic early in the morning
p259
aVand in the rush hour in the afternoon,
p260
aVbut nothing of big concern.
p261
aVWe are below average
p262
aVin terms of traffic incidents in the city.
p263
aa(lp264
VEP: Okay, so you're showing now some public services.
p265
aVThese are the cars.
p266
aa(lp267
VOsorio: Absolutely, Mr. Mayor.
p268
aVLet me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks.
p269
aVThis is live transmission.
p270
aVWe have GPS's in all of our trucks.
p271
aVAnd you can see them working
p272
aVin all parts of the city.
p273
aVWaste collection on time.
p274
aVPublic services working well.
p275
aa(lp276
VEP: Okay, Osorio, thank you very much.
p277
aVIt was great to have you here.
p278
aVWe're going to move so that I can make a conclusion.
p279
aV(Applause)
p280
aVOkay, so no files, this place, no paperwork,
p281
aVno distance, 24/7 working.
p282
aVSo the fourth commandment I want to share with you here tonight
p283
aVis, a city of the future
p284
aVhas to use technology to be present.
p285
aVI don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city.
p286
aa(lp287
VBut everything that I said here tonight, or the commandments,
p288
aVare means, are ways,
p289
aVfor us to govern cities \u2014
p290
aVinvest in infrastructure, invest in the green,
p291
aVopen parks, open spaces,
p292
aVintegrate socially, use technology.
p293
aVBut at the end of the day, when we talk about cities,
p294
aVwe talk about a gathering of people.
p295
aVAnd we cannot see that as a problem.
p296
aVThat is fantastic.
p297
aVIf there's 3.5 billion now,
p298
aVit's going to be six billion then it's going to be 10 billion.
p299
aVThat is great, that means we're going to have
p300
aV10 billion minds working together,
p301
aV10 billion talents together.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo a city of the future,
p304
aVI really do believe
p305
aVthat it's a city that cares about its citizens,
p306
aVintegrates socially its citizens.
p307
aVA city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out
p308
aVof this great party, which are cities.
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you very much.
p311

VI spent the better part of a decade
p5
aVlooking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide.
p6
aVAnd I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment
p7
aVthat to me sums up what there is to know
p8
aVabout American and democratic responses to mass atrocity.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd that moment came on April 21, 1994.
p11
aVSo 14 years ago, almost, in the middle of the Rwandan genocide,
p12
aVin which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated
p13
aVby the Rwandan government and some extremist militia.
p14
aVOn April 21, in the New York Times,
p15
aVthe paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people
p16
aVhad already been killed in the genocide.
p17
aVIt was in the paper \u2014 not on the front page.
p18
aVIt was a lot like the Holocaust coverage,
p19
aVit was buried in the paper.
p20
aVRwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy,
p21
aVand amazingly, genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut on April 21, a wonderfully honest moment occurred.
p24
aVAnd that was that an American congresswoman
p25
aVnamed Patricia Schroeder from Colorado
p26
aVmet with a group of journalists.
p27
aVAnd one of the journalists said to her, what's up?
p28
aVWhat's going on in the U.S. government?
p29
aVTwo to 300,000 people have just been exterminated
p30
aVin the last couple of weeks in Rwanda.
p31
aVIt's two weeks into the genocide at that time,
p32
aVbut of course, at that time you don't know how long it's going to last.
p33
aVAnd the journalist said, why is there so little response out of Washington?
p34
aVWhy no hearings, no denunciations,
p35
aVno people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy
p36
aVor in front of the White House? What's the deal?
p37
aVAnd she said \u2014 she was so honest \u2014 she said, "It's a great question.
p38
aVAll I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado
p39
aVand my office in Washington,
p40
aVwe're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls
p41
aVabout the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda,
p42
aVbut nobody is calling about the people.
p43
aVThe phones just aren't ringing about the people."
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it.
p46
aVAnd that truth is, or was, in the 20th century,
p47
aVthat while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements,
p48
aVwe didn't have an endangered people's movement.
p49
aVWe had Holocaust education in the schools.
p50
aVMost of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe,
p51
aVbut also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust.
p52
aVThere's a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington,
p53
aVright next to Lincoln and Jefferson.
p54
aVI mean, we have owned Never Again culturally,
p55
aVappropriately, interestingly.
p56
aVAnd yet the politicization of Never Again,
p57
aVthe operationalization of Never Again,
p58
aVhad never occurred in the 20th century.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows:
p61
aVthat if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities,
p62
aVwe have to make it such.
p63
aVThere has to be a role \u2014
p64
aVthere has to be the creation of political noise and political costs
p65
aVin response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth.
p66
aVSo that was the 20th century.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow here \u2014 and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon \u2014
p69
aVthere is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century,
p70
aVand that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being
p71
aVan anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency,
p72
aVand one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.
p73
aVIt grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur.
p74
aVIt is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters
p75
aVon college campuses around the country.
p76
aVIt's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement.
p77
aVThere are something like 500 high school chapters
p78
aVdevoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur.
p79
aVEvangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.
p80
aV"Hotel Rwanda" watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement.
p81
aa(lp82
VTo call it a movement, as with all movements, perhaps, is a little misleading.
p83
aVIt's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches.
p84
aVIt's got all the ups and the downs of movements.
p85
aVBut it has been amazingly successful in one regard,
p86
aVin that it has become,
p87
aVit has congealed into this endangered people's movement
p88
aVthat was missing in the 20th century.
p89
aVIt sees itself, such as it is, the it,
p90
aVas something that will create the impression that there will be political cost,
p91
aVthere will be a political price to be paid,
p92
aVfor allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination,
p93
aVfor not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow because it's student-driven,
p96
aVthere's some amazing things that the movement has done.
p97
aVThey have launched a divestment campaign
p98
aVthat has now convinced, I think, 55 universities in 22 states
p99
aVto divest their holdings of stocks
p100
aVwith regard to companies doing business in Sudan.
p101
aVThey have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number \u2014
p102
aVthis is going to sound very kitsch,
p103
aVbut for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical,
p104
aVbut interested in doing something about genocide,
p105
aVyou dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code,
p106
aVand you don't even have to know who your congressperson is.
p107
aVIt will refer you directly to your congressperson, to your U.S. senator,
p108
aVto your governor where divestment legislation is pending.
p109
aVThey've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide.
p110
aVI think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently
p111
aVare genocide grades.
p112
aVAnd it takes students to introduce genocide grades.
p113
aVSo what you now have when a Congress is in session
p114
aVis members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds
p115
aVand saying, I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide;
p116
aVwhat do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me.
p117
aVAnd the students and the others
p118
aVwho are part of this incredibly energized base
p119
aVare there to answer that, and there's always something to do.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration
p122
aVfrom the United States,
p123
aVat a time of massive over-stretch \u2014 military, financial, diplomatic \u2014
p124
aVa whole series of commitments to Darfur
p125
aVthat no other country in the world is making.
p126
aVFor instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur
p127
aVto the International Criminal Court,
p128
aVwhich the Bush administration doesn't like.
p129
aVThe expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep,
p130
aVbasically, the people who've been displaced from their homes
p131
aVby the Sudanese government, by the so-called Janjaweed, the militia,
p132
aVto keep those people alive
p133
aVuntil something more durable can be achieved.
p134
aVAnd recently, or now not that recently,
p135
aVabout six months ago, the authorization of a peacekeeping force
p136
aVof 26,000 that will go.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd that's all the Bush administration's leadership,
p139
aVand it's all because of this bottom-up pressure
p140
aVand the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing
p141
aVfrom the beginning of this crisis.
p142
aVThe bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail,
p143
aVis that evil lives on.
p144
aVThe people in those camps are surrounded on all sides
p145
aVby so-called Janjaweed, these men on horseback
p146
aVwith spears and Kalashnikovs.
p147
aVWomen who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid
p148
aVin order to feed their families \u2014 humanitarian aid,
p149
aVthe dirty secret of it is it has to be heated, really, to be edible \u2014
p150
aVare themselves subjected to rape,
p151
aVwhich is a tool of the genocide that is being used.
p152
aVAnd the peacekeepers I've mentioned, the force has been authorized,
p153
aVbut almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization
p154
aVto actually put its troops or its police in harm's way.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century,
p157
aVand yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding
p158
aVas we sit here, as we speak.
p159
aVWhy the limits to the movement?
p160
aVWhy is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done,
p161
aVbeen necessary but not sufficient to the crime?
p162
aVI think there are a couple \u2014 there are many reasons \u2014
p163
aVbut a couple just to focus on briefly.
p164
aa(lp165
VThe first is that the movement, such as it is,
p166
aVstops at America's borders.  It is not a global movement.
p167
aVIt does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves
p168
aVare asking their governments to do more to stop genocide.
p169
aVAnd the Holocaust culture that we have in this country
p170
aVmakes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think,
p171
aVwant to bring Never Again to life.
p172
aVThe guilt that the Clinton administration expressed,
p173
aVthat Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda,
p174
aVcreated a space in our society for a consensus
p175
aVthat Rwanda was bad and wrong
p176
aVand we wish we had done more, and that is something
p177
aVthat the movement has taken advantage of.
p178
aVEuropean governments, for the most part,
p179
aVhaven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of
p180
aVto push back and up against.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo this movement, if it's to be durable and global,
p183
aVwill have to cross borders, and you will have to see
p184
aVother citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption
p185
aVthat their government would do something in the face of genocide,
p186
aVbut actually making it such.
p187
aVGovernments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude
p188
aVnaturally or eagerly.
p189
aVAs we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports
p190
aVor reigning in loose nukes.
p191
aVWhy would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself
p192
aVtowards distant suffering?
p193
aVSo one reason is it hasn't gone global.
p194
aa(lp195
VThe second is, of course, that at this time in particular in America's history,
p196
aVwe have a credibility problem,
p197
aVa legitimacy problem in international institutions.
p198
aVIt is structurally really, really hard to do,
p199
aVas the Bush administration rightly does,
p200
aVwhich is to denounce genocide on a Monday
p201
aVand then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no-brainer
p202
aVand then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments.
p203
aVNow, other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved.
p204
aVLet me be clear.
p205
aVThey're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi.
p206
aVBut it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere,
p207
aVof course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world.
p208
aVThe recovery's going to take some time.
p209
aa(lp210
VWe have to ask ourselves, what now? What do we do going forward
p211
aVas a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places,
p212
aVthe world's worst suffering, killers, and the kinds of killers
p213
aVthat could come home to roost sometime in the future?
p214
aVThe place that I turned to answer that question was to a man
p215
aVthat many of you may not have ever heard of,
p216
aVand that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who,
p217
aVas Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003.
p218
aVHe was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in Iraq.
p219
aVIt's hard to remember, but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003,
p220
aVeven after the U.S. invasion, where,
p221
aVapart from looting, civilians were relatively safe in Iraq.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow, who was Sergio? Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name.
p224
aVIn addition to being Brazilian, he was described to me
p225
aVbefore I met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between
p226
aVJames Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other.
p227
aVAnd in the U.N., you don't get that many people
p228
aVwho actually manage to merge those qualities.
p229
aVHe was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious.
p230
aVHe was drawn to the flames, he chased the flames,
p231
aVhe was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie.
p232
aVHe was successful with women.
p233
aVHe was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell
p234
aVif he was a realist masquerading as an idealist
p235
aVor an idealist masquerading as a realist, as people always wondered
p236
aVabout Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way.
p237
aa(lp238
VWhat he was was a decathlete of nation-building, of problem-solving,
p239
aVof troubleshooting in the world's worst places
p240
aVand in the world's most broken places.
p241
aVIn failing states, genocidal states, under-governed states,
p242
aVprecisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist
p243
aVon the horizon, and precisely the kinds of places
p244
aVwhere most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated.
p245
aVThese are the places he was drawn to.
p246
aVHe moved with the headlines.
p247
aVHe was in the U.N. for 34 years. He joined at the age of 21.
p248
aVStarted off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s
p249
aVwere wars of independence and decolonization.
p250
aVHe was there in Bangladesh
p251
aVdealing with the outflow of millions of refugees \u2014
p252
aVthe largest refugee flow in history up to that point.
p253
aVHe was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there.
p254
aVHe was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion.
p255
aVHe was in Mozambique for the War of Independence.
p256
aVHe was in Lebanon. Amazingly, he was in Lebanon \u2014 the U.N. base was used \u2014
p257
aVPalestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base.
p258
aVIsrael then invaded and overran the U.N. base.
p259
aa(lp260
VSergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit
p261
aVby the first-ever suicide attack against the United States.
p262
aVPeople date the beginning of this new era to 9/11, but surely 1983,
p263
aVwith the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks \u2014
p264
aVwhich Sergio witnessed \u2014 those are, in fact, in some ways,
p265
aVthe dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today.
p266
aVFrom Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s.
p267
aVThe issues were, of course, ethnic sectarian violence.
p268
aVHe was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge.
p269
aVTalk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room
p270
aVwith the embodiment of evil in Cambodia.
p271
aVHe negotiates with the Serbs.
p272
aVHe actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil
p273
aVand trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail
p274
aVthat he earns the nickname \u2014 not Sergio but Serbio
p275
aVwhile he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations.
p276
aa(lp277
VHe then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide,
p278
aVand he's the guy who has to decide \u2014 huh, OK, the genocide is over;
p279
aV800,000 people have been killed; the people responsible are fleeing
p280
aVinto neighboring countries \u2014 into Congo, into Tanzania.
p281
aVI'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those \u2014
p282
aVwell, I don't want to feed the killers
p283
aVbut I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go,
p284
aVwe're going to set up camps,
p285
aVand we're going to supply humanitarian aid.
p286
aVBut, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps.
p287
aVWell, I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves.
p288
aVLet me go door-to-door to the international community
p289
aVand see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation.
p290
aVAnd their response, of course, was no more than we wanted
p291
aVto stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that,
p292
aVnor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo then you have to make the decision.
p295
aVDo you turn off the international spigot of life support
p296
aVand risk two million civilian lives?
p297
aVOr do you continue feeding the civilians, knowing that the genocidaires
p298
aVare in the camps, literally sharpening their knives for future battle?
p299
aVWhat do you do?
p300
aVIt's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places.
p301
aa(lp302
VLate '90s: nation-building is the cause du jour.
p303
aVHe's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer
p304
aVof first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places.
p305
aVHe's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy, on currency,
p306
aVon border patrol, on policing. He has to make all these judgments.
p307
aVHe's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages.
p308
aVHe's been up to that point in 14 war zones
p309
aVso he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps,
p310
aVthan people who have never done that kind of work.
p311
aVBut nonetheless, he is the cutting edge of our experimentation
p312
aVwith doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in,
p313
aVagain, the world's worst places.
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd then after Timor, 9/11 has happened,
p316
aVhe's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner,
p317
aVand he has to balance liberty and security and figure out,
p318
aVwhat do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations
p319
aVis bowing out of the Geneva Conventions,
p320
aVbowing out of international law? Do you denounce?
p321
aVWell, if you denounce,
p322
aVyou're probably never going to get back in the room.
p323
aVMaybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush \u2014
p324
aVand that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself,
p325
aVunfortunately, his final and tragic appointment to Iraq \u2014
p326
aVthe one that resulted in his death.
p327
aa(lp328
VOne note on his death, which is so devastating,
p329
aVis that despite predicating the war on Iraq
p330
aVon a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in 9/11,
p331
aVbelieve it or not, the Bush administration or the invaders
p332
aVdid no planning, no pre-war planning, to respond to terrorism.
p333
aVSo Sergio \u2014 this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil
p334
aVand how to deal with brokenness,
p335
aVlay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue.
p336
aVStateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career.
p337
aVLike a refugee. Because he represents the U.N.
p338
aa(lp339
VIf you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one.
p340
aVYou're un-owned.
p341
aVAnd what the American \u2014 the most powerful military in the history of mankind
p342
aVwas able to muster for his rescue,
p343
aVbelieve it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers
p344
aVwent into the shaft. Building was shaking.
p345
aVOne of them had been at 9/11 and lost his buddies on September 11th,
p346
aVand yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio.
p347
aVBut all they had was a woman's handbag \u2014
p348
aVliterally one of those basket handbags \u2014
p349
aVand they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters,
p350
aVand created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building
p351
aVin the interests of rescuing this person,
p352
aVthe person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd,
p353
aVat a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance.
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio.
p356
aVThe good news, for what it's worth,
p357
aVis after Sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N.,
p358
aVthe military created a search and rescue unit
p359
aVthat had the cutting equipment, the shoring wood, the cranes,
p360
aVthe things that you would have needed to do the rescue.
p361
aVBut it was too late for Sergio.
p362
aa(lp363
VI want to wrap up, but I want to close
p364
aVwith what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life
p365
aVon this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing,
p366
aVwhich is how I would have framed the question.
p367
aVHere's this guy who got a 34-year head start
p368
aVthinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with,
p369
aVwe as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away?
p370
aa(lp371
VFirst, I think, is his relationship to, in fact, evil is something to learn from.
p372
aVHe, over the course of his career, changed a great deal.
p373
aVHe had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive.
p374
aVI think that was his greatest quality.
p375
aVHe started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers,
p376
aVhe would charge up to people who were violating international law,
p377
aVand he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter.
p378
aVDon't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing?
p379
aVAnd they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states,
p380
aVthe power of any military or police.
p381
aVHe just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them.
p382
aVAnd in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82,
p383
aVhe said to himself and to everybody else,
p384
aVI will never use the word "unacceptable" again.
p385
aVI will never use it. I will try to make it such,
p386
aVbut I will never use that word again.
p387
aVBut he lunged in the opposite direction.
p388
aVHe started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil,
p389
aVto not denounce, and became almost obsequious
p390
aVwhen he won the nickname Serbio, for instance,
p391
aVand even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge
p392
aVwould black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.

aa(lp394
VBut by the end of his life, I think he had struck a balance
p395
aVthat we as a country can learn from.
p396
aVBe in the room, don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries,
p397
aVbut don't bracket what happened before you entered the room.
p398
aVDon't black-box history. Don't check your principles at the door.
p399
aVAnd I think that's something that we have to be in the room,
p400
aVwhether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy
p401
aVor Reagan and Gorbachev.
p402
aVAll the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries
p403
aVhas come by going into the room.
p404
aVAnd it doesn't have to be an act of weakness.
p405
aVYou can actually do far more to build an international coalition
p406
aVagainst a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room
p407
aVand showing to the rest of the world that that person, that regime,
p408
aVis the problem and that you, the United States, are not the problem.
p409
aa(lp410
VSecond take-away from Sergio's life, briefly.
p411
aVWhat I take away, and this in some ways is the most important,
p412
aVhe espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity
p413
aVthat was really, really unusual.
p414
aVAt a micro level, the individuals around him were visible.
p415
aVHe saw them.
p416
aVAt a macro level, he thought, you know,
p417
aVwe talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes
p418
aVthat's an affront to people's dignity.
p419
aVWe put people on humanitarian aid
p420
aVand we boast about it because we've spent three billion.
p421
aVIt's incredibly important,
p422
aVthose people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance,
p423
aVhadn't spent that money in Darfur,
p424
aVbut it's not a way to live.
p425
aVIf we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens
p426
aVand as individuals with relation to the people around us,
p427
aVand as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity
p428
aVinto our dealings with other countries,
p429
aVit would be something of a revolution.
p430
aa(lp431
VThird point, very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear.
p432
aVAnd I recognize there is so much to be afraid of.
p433
aVThere are so many genuine threats in the world.
p434
aVBut what Sergio was talking about is,
p435
aVlet's calibrate our relationship to the threat.
p436
aVLet's not hype the threat; let's actually see it clearly.
p437
aVWe have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps.
p438
aVWe have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured
p439
aVloose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.
p440
aVLet's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats,
p441
aVbut not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.
p442
aVIn times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say
p443
aVis, fear is a bad advisor.
p444
aVWe lunge towards the extremes
p445
aVwhen we aren't operating and trying to, again,
p446
aVcalibrate our relationship to the world around us.
p447
aa(lp448
VFourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working
p449
aVin all the world's worst places and all lesser evils,
p450
aVhad a humility, of course,
p451
aVand an awareness of the complexity of the world around him.
p452
aVI mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.
p453
aVHow Sisyphean this task was of mending,
p454
aVand yet aware of that complexity,
p455
aVhumbled by it, he wasn't paralyzed by it.
p456
aVAnd we as citizens, as we go through this experience of the kind of,
p457
aVthe crisis of confidence, crisis of competence, crisis of legitimacy,
p458
aVI think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say,
p459
aVah, Katrina, Iraq \u2014 we don't know what we're doing.
p460
aVWe can't afford to pull back from the world.
p461
aVIt's a question of how to be in the world.
p462
aa(lp463
VAnd the lesson, I think,
p464
aVof the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned,
p465
aVthat is a partial success but by no means
p466
aVhas it achieved what it has set out to do \u2014
p467
aVit'll be many decades, probably, before that happens \u2014
p468
aVbut is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.
p469
aVWe can't rely upon our institutions to do the work
p470
aVof necessarily talking to adversaries on their own
p471
aVwithout us creating a space for that to happen,
p472
aVfor having respect for dignity,
p473
aVand for bringing that combination of humility
p474
aVand a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility
p475
aVto our dealings with the rest of the world.
p476
aVSo will evil prevail? Is that the question?
p477
aVI think the short answer is: no, not unless we let it.
p478
aa(lp479
VThank you.
p480
aV(Applause)

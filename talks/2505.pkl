VI worked as a war reporter for 15 years
p5
aVbefore I realized that I really had a problem.
p6
aVThere was something really wrong with me.
p7
aa(lp8
VThis was about a year before 9/11, and America wasn't at war yet.
p9
aVWe weren't talking about PTSD.
p10
aVWe were not yet talking about the effect of trauma and war
p11
aVon the human psyche.
p12
aVI'd been in Afghanistan for a couple of months
p13
aVwith the Northern Alliance as they were fighting the Taliban.
p14
aVAnd at that point the Taliban had an air force,
p15
aVthey had fighter planes, they had tanks, they had artillery,
p16
aVand we really got hammered pretty badly a couple of times.
p17
aVWe saw some very ugly things.
p18
aVBut I didn't really think it affected me.
p19
aVI didn't think much about it.
p20
aa(lp21
VI came home to New York, where I live.
p22
aVThen one day I went down into the subway,
p23
aVand for the first time in my life,
p24
aVI knew real fear.
p25
aVI had a massive panic attack.
p26
aVI was way more scared than I had ever been in Afghanistan.
p27
aVEverything I was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me,
p28
aVbut I couldn't explain why.
p29
aVThe trains were going too fast.
p30
aVThere were too many people.
p31
aVThe lights were too bright.
p32
aVEverything was too loud, everything was moving too quickly.
p33
aVI backed up against a support column and just waited for it.
p34
aVWhen I couldn't take it any longer, I ran out of the subway station
p35
aVand walked wherever I was going.
p36
aa(lp37
VLater, I found out that what I had was short-term PTSD:
p38
aVpost-traumatic stress disorder.
p39
aVWe evolved as animals, as primates, to survive periods of danger,
p40
aVand if your life has been in danger,
p41
aVyou want to react to unfamiliar noises.
p42
aVYou want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.
p43
aVYou want to have nightmares and flashbacks
p44
aVof the thing that could kill you.
p45
aVYou want to be angry because it makes you predisposed to fight,
p46
aVor depressed, because it keeps you out of circulation a little bit.
p47
aVKeeps you safe.
p48
aVIt's not very pleasant, but it's better than getting eaten.
p49
aa(lp50
VMost people recover from that pretty quickly.
p51
aVIt takes a few weeks, a few months.
p52
aVI kept having panic attacks, but they eventually went away.
p53
aVI had no idea it was connected to the war that I'd seen.
p54
aVI just thought I was going crazy,
p55
aVand then I thought, well, now I'm not going crazy anymore.
p56
aa(lp57
VAbout 20 percent of people, however,
p58
aVwind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.
p59
aVThey are not adapted to temporary danger.
p60
aVThey are maladapted for everyday life,
p61
aVunless they get help.
p62
aVWe know that the people who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD
p63
aVare people who were abused as children,
p64
aVwho suffered trauma as children,
p65
aVpeople who have low education levels,
p66
aVpeople who have psychiatric disorders in their family.
p67
aVIf you served in Vietnam
p68
aVand your brother is schizophrenic,
p69
aVyou're way more likely to get long-term PTSD from Vietnam.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo I started to study this as a journalist,
p72
aVand I realized that there was something really strange going on.
p73
aVThe numbers seemed to be going in the wrong direction.
p74
aVEvery war that we have fought as a country,
p75
aVstarting with the Civil War,
p76
aVthe intensity of the combat has gone down.
p77
aVAs a result, the casualty rates have gone down.
p78
aVBut disability rates have gone up.
p79
aVThey should be going in the same direction,
p80
aVbut they're going in different directions.
p81
aa(lp82
VThe recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced, thank God,
p83
aVa casualty rate about one third of what it was in Vietnam.
p84
aVBut they've also created \u2014
p85
aVthey've also produced three times the disability rates.
p86
aVAround 10 percent of the US military is actively engaged in combat,
p87
aV10 percent or under.
p88
aVThey're shooting at people, killing people,
p89
aVgetting shot at, seeing their friends get killed.
p90
aVIt's incredibly traumatic.
p91
aVBut it's only about 10 percent of our military.
p92
aVBut about half of our military has filed
p93
aVfor some kind of PTSD compensation from the government.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd suicide doesn't even fit into this in a very logical way.
p96
aVWe've all heard the tragic statistic of 22 vets a day, on average,
p97
aVin this country, killing themselves.
p98
aVMost people don't realize
p99
aVthat the majority of those suicides are veterans of the Vietnam War,
p100
aVthat generation,
p101
aVand their decision to take their own lives actually might not be related
p102
aVto the war they fought 50 years earlier.
p103
aVIn fact, there's no statistical connection between combat and suicide.
p104
aVIf you're in the military and you're in a lot of combat,
p105
aVyou're no more likely to kill yourself than if you weren't.
p106
aVIn fact, one study found
p107
aVthat if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,
p108
aVyou're actually slightly less likely to commit suicide later.
p109
aa(lp110
VI studied anthropology in college.
p111
aVI did my fieldwork on the Navajo reservation.
p112
aVI wrote a thesis on Navajo long-distance runners.
p113
aVAnd recently, while I was researching PTSD,
p114
aVI had this thought.
p115
aVI thought back to the work I did when I was young,
p116
aVand I thought, I bet the Navajo, the Apache, the Comanche \u2014
p117
aVI mean, these are very warlike nations \u2014
p118
aVI bet they weren't getting PTSD like we do.
p119
aVWhen their warriors came back from fighting the US military
p120
aVor fighting each other,
p121
aVI bet they pretty much just slipped right back into tribal life.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd maybe what determines
p124
aVthe rate of long-term PTSD
p125
aVisn't what happened out there,
p126
aVbut the kind of society you come back to.
p127
aVAnd maybe if you come back to a close, cohesive, tribal society,
p128
aVyou can get over trauma pretty quickly.
p129
aVAnd if you come back to an alienating, modern society,
p130
aVyou might remain traumatized your entire life.
p131
aVIn other words, maybe the problem isn't them, the vets;
p132
aVmaybe the problem is us.
p133
aa(lp134
VCertainly, modern society is hard on the human psyche
p135
aVby every metric that we have.
p136
aVAs wealth goes up in a society,
p137
aVthe suicide rate goes up instead of down.
p138
aVIf you live in modern society,
p139
aVyou're up to eight times more likely
p140
aVto suffer from depression in your lifetime
p141
aVthan if you live in a poor, agrarian society.
p142
aVModern society has probably produced the highest rates of suicide
p143
aVand depression and anxiety and loneliness and child abuse
p144
aVever in human history.
p145
aVI saw one study
p146
aVthat compared women in Nigeria,
p147
aVone of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt
p148
aVand poorest countries in Africa,
p149
aVto women in North America.
p150
aVAnd the highest rates of depression were urban women in North America.
p151
aVThat was also the wealthiest group.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo let's go back to the US military.
p154
aVTen percent are in combat.
p155
aVAround 50 percent have filed for PTSD compensation.
p156
aVSo about 40 percent of veterans really were not traumatized overseas
p157
aVbut have come home to discover they are dangerously alienated
p158
aVand depressed.
p159
aVSo what is happening with them?
p160
aVWhat's going on with those people,
p161
aVthe phantom 40 percent that are troubled but don't understand why?
p162
aa(lp163
VMaybe it's this:
p164
aVmaybe they had an experience of sort of tribal closeness
p165
aVin their unit when they were overseas.
p166
aVThey were eating together, sleeping together,
p167
aVdoing tasks and missions together.
p168
aVThey were trusting each other with their lives.
p169
aVAnd then they come home
p170
aVand they have to give all that up
p171
aVand they're coming back to a society, a modern society,
p172
aVwhich is hard on people who weren't even in the military.
p173
aVIt's just hard on everybody.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.
p176
aVBut for a lot of these people,
p177
aVmaybe it's not trauma.
p178
aVI mean, certainly, soldiers are traumatized
p179
aVand the ones who are have to be treated for that.
p180
aVBut a lot of them \u2014
p181
aVmaybe what's bothering them is actually a kind of alienation.
p182
aVI mean, maybe we just have the wrong word for some of it,
p183
aVand just changing our language, our understanding,
p184
aVwould help a little bit.
p185
aV"Post-deployment alienation disorder."
p186
aVMaybe even just calling it that for some of these people
p187
aVwould allow them to stop imagining
p188
aVtrying to imagine a trauma that didn't really happen
p189
aVin order to explain a feeling that really is happening.
p190
aVAnd in fact, it's an extremely dangerous feeling.
p191
aVThat alienation and depression can lead to suicide.
p192
aVThese people are in danger.
p193
aVIt's very important to understand why.
p194
aa(lp195
VThe Israeli military has a PTSD rate of around one percent.
p196
aVThe theory is that everyone in Israel is supposed to serve in the military.
p197
aVWhen soldiers come back from the front line,
p198
aVthey're not going from a military environment to a civilian environment.
p199
aVThey're coming back to a community where everyone understands
p200
aVabout the military.
p201
aVEveryone's been in it or is going to be in it.
p202
aVEveryone understands the situation they're all in.
p203
aVIt's as if they're all in one big tribe.
p204
aa(lp205
VWe know that if you take a lab rat
p206
aVand traumatize it and put it in a cage by itself,
p207
aVyou can maintain its trauma symptoms almost indefinitely.
p208
aVAnd if you take that same lab rat and put it in a cage with other rats,
p209
aVafter a couple of weeks, it's pretty much OK.
p210
aa(lp211
VAfter 9/11,
p212
aVthe murder rate in New York City went down by 40 percent.
p213
aVThe suicide rate went down.
p214
aVThe violent crime rate in New York went down after 9/11.
p215
aVEven combat veterans of previous wars who suffered from PTSD
p216
aVsaid that their symptoms went down after 9/11 happened.
p217
aVThe reason is that if you traumatize an entire society,
p218
aVwe don't fall apart and turn on one another.
p219
aVWe come together. We unify.
p220
aVBasically, we tribalize,
p221
aVand that process of unifying feels so good and is so good for us,
p222
aVthat it even helps people
p223
aVwho are struggling with mental health issues.
p224
aVDuring the blitz in London,
p225
aVadmissions to psychiatric wards went down during the bombings.
p226
aa(lp227
VFor a while, that was the kind of country
p228
aVthat American soldiers came back to \u2014 a unified country.
p229
aVWe were sticking together.
p230
aVWe were trying to understand the threat against us.
p231
aVWe were trying to help ourselves and the world.
p232
aVBut that's changed.
p233
aVNow, American soldiers,
p234
aVAmerican veterans are coming back to a country that is so bitterly divided
p235
aVthat the two political parties are literally accusing each other
p236
aVof treason, of being an enemy of the state,
p237
aVof trying to undermine the security and the welfare of their own country.
p238
aVThe gap between rich and poor is the biggest it's ever been.
p239
aVIt's just getting worse.
p240
aVRace relations are terrible.
p241
aVThere are demonstrations and even riots in the streets
p242
aVbecause of racial injustice.
p243
aVAnd veterans know that any tribe that treated itself that way \u2014 in fact,
p244
aVany platoon that treated itself that way \u2014 would never survive.
p245
aVWe've gotten used to it.
p246
aVVeterans have gone away and are coming back
p247
aVand seeing their own country with fresh eyes.
p248
aVAnd they see what's going on.
p249
aVThis is the country they fought for.
p250
aVNo wonder they're depressed.
p251
aVNo wonder they're scared.
p252
aa(lp253
VSometimes, we ask ourselves if we can save the vets.
p254
aVI think the real question is if we can save ourselves.
p255
aVIf we can,
p256
aVI think the vets are going to be fine.
p257
aVIt's time for this country to unite,
p258
aVif only to help the men and women who fought to protect us.
p259
aa(lp260
VThank you very much.

VWhen, in 1960, still a student,
p5
aVI got a traveling fellowship
p6
aVto study housing in North America.
p7
aVWe traveled the country.
p8
aVWe saw public housing high-rise buildings
p9
aVin all major cities:
p10
aVNew York, Philadelphia.
p11
aVThose who have no choice lived there.
p12
aVAnd then we traveled from suburb to suburb,
p13
aVand I came back thinking,
p14
aVwe've got to reinvent the apartment building.
p15
aVThere has to be another way of doing this.
p16
aVWe can't sustain suburbs,
p17
aVso let's design a building
p18
aVwhich gives the qualities of a house
p19
aVto each unit.
p20
aa(lp21
VHabitat would be all about gardens,
p22
aVcontact with nature,
p23
aVstreets instead of corridors.
p24
aVWe prefabricated it so we would achieve economy,
p25
aVand there it is almost 50 years later.
p26
aVIt's a very desirable place to live in.
p27
aVIt's now a heritage building,
p28
aVbut it did not proliferate.
p29
aa(lp30
VIn 1973, I made my first trip to China.
p31
aVIt was the Cultural Revolution.
p32
aVWe traveled the country,
p33
aVmet with architects and planners.
p34
aVThis is Beijing then,
p35
aVnot a single high rise building
p36
aVin Beijing or Shanghai.
p37
aVShenzhen didn't even exist as a city.
p38
aVThere were hardly any cars.
p39
aVThirty years later,
p40
aVthis is Beijing today.
p41
aVThis is Hong Kong.
p42
aVIf you're wealthy, you live there,
p43
aVif you're poor, you live there,
p44
aVbut high density it is, and it's not just Asia.
p45
aVSão Paulo, you can travel
p46
aVin a helicopter 45 minutes
p47
aVseeing those high-rise buildings consume
p48
aVthe 19th-century low-rise environment.
p49
aVAnd with it, comes congestion,
p50
aVand we lose mobility, and so on and so forth.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo a few years ago, we decided to go back
p53
aVand rethink Habitat.
p54
aVCould we make it more affordable?
p55
aVCould we actually achieve this quality of life
p56
aVin the densities that are prevailing today?
p57
aVAnd we realized, it's basically about light,
p58
aVit's about sun, it's about nature,
p59
aVit's about fractalization.
p60
aVCan we open up the surface of the building
p61
aVso that it has more contact with the exterior?
p62
aa(lp63
VWe came up with a number of models:
p64
aVeconomy models, cheaper to build and more compact;
p65
aVmembranes of housing
p66
aVwhere people could design their own house
p67
aVand create their own gardens.
p68
aVAnd then we decided to take New York as a test case,
p69
aVand we looked at Lower Manhattan.
p70
aVAnd we mapped all the building area in Manhattan.
p71
aVOn the left is Manhattan today:
p72
aVblue for housing, red for office buildings, retail.
p73
aVOn the right, we reconfigured it:
p74
aVthe office buildings form the base,
p75
aVand then rising 75 stories above,
p76
aVare apartments.
p77
aVThere's a street in the air on the 25th level,
p78
aVa community street.
p79
aVIt's permeable.
p80
aVThere are gardens and open spaces
p81
aVfor the community,
p82
aValmost every unit with its own private garden,
p83
aVand community space all around.
p84
aVAnd most important, permeable, open.
p85
aVIt does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city,
p86
aVand light permeates everywhere.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd in the last two or three years,
p89
aVwe've actually been, for the first time,
p90
aVrealizing the quality of life of Habitat
p91
aVin real-life projects across Asia.
p92
aVThis in Qinhuangdao in China:
p93
aVmiddle-income housing, where there is a bylaw
p94
aVthat every apartment must receive
p95
aVthree hours of sunlight.
p96
aVThat's measured in the winter solstice.
p97
aVAnd under construction in Singapore,
p98
aVagain middle-income housing, gardens,
p99
aVcommunity streets and parks and so on and so forth.
p100
aVAnd Colombo.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I want to touch on one more issue,
p103
aVwhich is the design of the public realm.
p104
aVA hundred years after we've begun building
p105
aVwith tall buildings,
p106
aVwe are yet to understand
p107
aVhow the tall high-rise building
p108
aVbecomes a building block in making a city,
p109
aVin creating the public realm.
p110
aVIn Singapore, we had an opportunity:
p111
aV10 million square feet, extremely high density.
p112
aVTaking the concept of outdoor and indoor,
p113
aVpromenades and parks integrated
p114
aVwith intense urban life.
p115
aVSo they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces,
p116
aVand you move from one to the other,
p117
aVand there is contact with nature,
p118
aVand most relevantly, at every level of the structure,
p119
aVpublic gardens and open space:
p120
aVon the roof of the podium,
p121
aVclimbing up the towers,
p122
aVand finally on the roof, the sky park,
p123
aVtwo and a half acres, jogging paths, restaurants,
p124
aVand the world's longest swimming pool.
p125
aVAnd that's all I can tell you in five minutes.
p126
aa(lp127
VThank you.

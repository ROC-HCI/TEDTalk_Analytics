VSeveral years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman
p5
aVintroduced a design challenge
p6
aVcalled the marshmallow challenge.
p7
aVAnd the idea's pretty simple:
p8
aVTeams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure
p9
aVout of 20 sticks of spaghetti,
p10
aVone yard of tape, one yard of string
p11
aVand a marshmallow.
p12
aVThe marshmallow has to be on top.
p13
aVAnd, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard
p14
aVbecause it forces people
p15
aVto collaborate very quickly.
p16
aVAnd so, I thought this was an interesting idea,
p17
aVand I incorporated it into a design workshop.
p18
aVAnd it was a huge success.
p19
aVAnd since then, I've conducted
p20
aVabout 70 design workshops across the world
p21
aVwith students and designers and architects,
p22
aVeven the CTOs of the Fortune 50,
p23
aVand there's something about this exercise
p24
aVthat reveals very deep lessons
p25
aVabout the nature of collaboration,
p26
aVand I'd like to share some of them with you.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo, normally, most people begin
p29
aVby orienting themselves to the task.
p30
aVThey talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,
p31
aVthey jockey for power.
p32
aVThen they spend some time planning, organizing,
p33
aVthey sketch and they lay out spaghetti.
p34
aVThey spend the majority of their time
p35
aVassembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.
p36
aVAnd then finally, just as they're running out of time,
p37
aVsomeone takes out the marshmallow,
p38
aVand then they gingerly put it on top,
p39
aVand then they stand back, and \u2014 ta-da! \u2014
p40
aVthey admire their work.
p41
aVBut what really happens, most of the time,
p42
aVis that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh,"
p43
aVbecause the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure
p44
aVto buckle and to collapse.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo there are a number of people
p47
aVwho have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others,
p48
aVand among the worst are recent graduates of business school.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVThey lie, they cheat, they get distracted
p51
aVand they produce really lame structures.
p52
aVAnd of course there are teams
p53
aVthat have a lot more "ta-da" structures,
p54
aVand among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVAnd it's pretty amazing.
p57
aVAs Peter tells us,
p58
aVnot only do they produce the tallest structures,
p59
aVbut they're the most interesting structures of them all.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo the question you want to ask is:
p62
aVHow come? Why? What is it about them?
p63
aVAnd Peter likes to say that
p64
aVnone of the kids spend any time
p65
aVtrying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?
p66
aVThey don't spend time jockeying for power.
p67
aVBut there's another reason as well.
p68
aVAnd the reason is that business students are trained
p69
aVto find the single right plan, right?
p70
aVAnd then they execute on it.
p71
aVAnd then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,
p72
aVthey run out of time and what happens?
p73
aVIt's a crisis.
p74
aVSound familiar? Right.
p75
aVWhat kindergarteners do differently
p76
aVis that they start with the marshmallow,
p77
aVand they build prototypes, successive prototypes,
p78
aValways keeping the marshmallow on top,
p79
aVso they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.
p80
aVDesigners recognize this type of collaboration
p81
aVas the essence of the iterative process.
p82
aVAnd with each version, kids get instant feedback
p83
aVabout what works and what doesn't work.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,
p86
aVbut let's look at how different teams perform.
p87
aVSo the average for most people is around 20 inches;
p88
aVbusiness schools students, about half of that;
p89
aVlawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,
p90
aVkindergarteners, better than most adults.
p91
aVWho does the very best?
p92
aVArchitects and engineers, thankfully.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVThirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.
p95
aVAnd why is it? Because they understand triangles
p96
aVand self-reinforcing geometrical patterns
p97
aVare the key to building
p98
aVstable structures.
p99
aVSo CEOs, a little bit better than average,
p100
aVbut here's where it gets interesting.
p101
aVIf you put you put an executive admin. on the team,
p102
aVthey get significantly better.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVIt's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win."
p105
aVYou can just tell beforehand. And why is that?
p106
aVBecause they have special skills
p107
aVof facilitation.
p108
aVThey manage the process, they understand the process.
p109
aVAnd any team who manages
p110
aVand pays close attention to work
p111
aVwill significantly improve the team's performance.
p112
aVSpecialized skills and facilitation skills
p113
aVare the combination that leads to strong success.
p114
aVIf you have 10 teams that typically perform,
p115
aVyou'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd I tried something interesting.
p118
aVI thought, let's up the ante, once.
p119
aVSo I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.
p120
aVSo what do you think happened to these design students?
p121
aVWhat was the result?
p122
aVHere's what happened:
p123
aVNot one team had a standing structure.
p124
aVIf anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,
p125
aVthey would have taken home the prize.
p126
aVSo, isn't that interesting? That high stakes
p127
aVhave a strong impact.
p128
aVWe did the exercise again with the same students.
p129
aVWhat do you think happened then?
p130
aVSo now they understand the value of prototyping.
p131
aVSo the same team went from being the very worst
p132
aVto being among the very best.
p133
aVThey produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.
p134
aVSo there's deep lessons for us
p135
aVabout the nature of incentives and success.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo, you might ask: Why would anyone
p138
aVactually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?
p139
aVAnd the reason is, I help create
p140
aVdigital tools and processes
p141
aVto help teams build cars and video games
p142
aVand visual effects.
p143
aVAnd what the marshmallow challenge does
p144
aVis it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.
p145
aVBecause, frankly,
p146
aVevery project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it?
p147
aVThe challenge provides a shared experience,
p148
aVa common language,
p149
aVa common stance to build the right prototype.
p150
aVAnd so, this is the value of the experience,
p151
aVof this so simple exercise.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd those of you who are interested
p154
aVmay want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
p155
aVIt's a blog that you can look at
p156
aVhow to build the marshmallows.
p157
aVThere's step-by-step instructions on this.
p158
aVThere are crazy examples from around the world
p159
aVof how people tweak and adjust the system.
p160
aVThere's world records that are on this as well.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd the fundamental lesson, I believe,
p163
aVis that design truly is
p164
aVa contact sport.
p165
aVIt demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,
p166
aVand that we apply the very best of our thinking,
p167
aVour feeling and our doing
p168
aVto the challenge that we have at hand.
p169
aVAnd sometimes, a little prototype of this experience
p170
aVis all that it takes to turn us
p171
aVfrom an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.
p172
aVAnd that can make a big difference.
p173
aa(lp174
VThank you very much.

VI want to speak about  a forgotten conflict.
p5
aVIt's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines.
p6
aVIt happens right here, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
p7
aa(lp8
VNow, most people outside of Africa don't know much about the war in Congo,
p9
aVso let me give you a couple of key facts.
p10
aVThe Congolese conflict is the deadliest  conflict since World War II.
p11
aVIt has caused almost four million deaths.
p12
aVIt has destabilized most of Central Africa for the past 18 years.
p13
aVIt is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world.
p14
aa(lp15
VThat's why I first went to Congo in 2001.
p16
aVI was a young humanitarian aid worker, and I met this woman who was my age.
p17
aVShe was called Isabelle.
p18
aVLocal militias had attacked Isabelle's village.
p19
aVThey had killed many men, raped many women.
p20
aVThey had looted everything.
p21
aVAnd then they wanted to take Isabelle,
p22
aVbut her husband stepped in,
p23
aVand he said, "No, please don't take Isabelle.
p24
aVTake me instead."
p25
aVSo he had gone to the forest with the militias,
p26
aVand Isabelle had never seen him again.
p27
aa(lp28
VWell, it's because of people like Isabelle and her husband
p29
aVthat I have devoted my career to studying this war
p30
aVthat we know so little about.
p31
aa(lp32
VAlthough there is one story about Congo that you may have heard.
p33
aVIt's a story about minerals and rape.
p34
aVPolicy statements and media reports
p35
aVboth usually focus on a primary cause of violence in Congo \u2014
p36
aVthe illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources \u2014
p37
aVand on a main consequence \u2014
p38
aVsexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo, not that these two issues aren't important and tragic. They are.
p41
aVBut today I want to tell you  a different story.
p42
aVI want to tell you a story that emphasizes a core cause
p43
aVof the ongoing conflict.
p44
aVViolence in Congo is in large part driven by local bottom-up conflicts
p45
aVthat international peace efforts have failed to help address.
p46
aa(lp47
VThe story starts from the fact that not only is Congo notable
p48
aVfor being the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis,
p49
aVbut it is also home to some of the largest
p50
aVinternational peacebuilding efforts in the world.
p51
aVCongo hosts the largest
p52
aVand most expensive United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world.
p53
aVIt was also the site of the first European-led peacekeeping mission,
p54
aVand for its first cases ever,
p55
aVthe International Criminal Court chose to prosecute Congolese warlords.
p56
aVIn 2006, when Congo held the first  free national elections in its history,
p57
aVmany observers thought that an end to  violence in the region had finally come.
p58
aVThe international community lauded the  successful organization of these elections
p59
aVas finally an example of successful international intervention
p60
aVin a failed state.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut the eastern provinces
p63
aVhave continued to face massive population displacements
p64
aVand horrific human rights violations.
p65
aVShortly before I went back there last summer,
p66
aVthere was a horrible massacre in the province of South Kivu.
p67
aVThirty-three people were killed.
p68
aVThey were mostly women and children,
p69
aVand many of them were hacked to death.
p70
aVDuring the past eight years,
p71
aVfighting in the eastern provinces has regularly reignited
p72
aVfull-scale civil and international war.
p73
aVSo basically, every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace,
p74
aVthe conflict explodes again.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhy?
p77
aVWhy have the massive international efforts
p78
aVfailed to help Congo  achieve lasting peace and security?
p79
aVWell, my answer to this question revolves around two central observations.
p80
aVFirst, one of the main reasons for the continuation of violence in Congo
p81
aVis fundamentally local \u2014
p82
aVand when I say local,
p83
aVI really mean at the level of the individual, the family,
p84
aVthe clan, the municipality, the community, the district,
p85
aVsometimes the ethnic group.
p86
aVFor instance, you remember the story of Isabelle that I told you.
p87
aVWell, the reason why militias had attacked Isabelle's village
p88
aVwas because they wanted to take the land
p89
aVthat the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive.
p90
aa(lp91
VThe second central observation is that international peace efforts
p92
aVhave failed to help address local conflicts
p93
aVbecause of the presence of a dominant peacebuilding culture.
p94
aVSo what I mean is that
p95
aVWestern and African diplomats,
p96
aVUnited Nations peacekeepers, donors,
p97
aVthe staff of most nongovernmental organizations
p98
aVthat work with the resolution of conflict,
p99
aVthey all share a specific way of seeing the world.
p100
aVAnd I was one of these people, and I shared this culture,
p101
aVso I know all too well how powerful it is.
p102
aVThroughout the world, and throughout conflict zones,
p103
aVthis common culture shapes the intervener's understanding
p104
aVof the causes of violence
p105
aVas something that is primarily located in the national and international spheres.
p106
aVIt shapes our understanding of the path toward peace
p107
aVas something again that requires top-down intervention
p108
aVto address national and international tensions.
p109
aVAnd it shapes our understanding of the roles of foreign actors
p110
aVas engaging in national and international peace processes.
p111
aVEven more importantly, this common culture
p112
aVenables international peacebuilders to ignore the micro-level tensions
p113
aVthat often jeopardize the macro-level settlements.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo for instance, in Congo,
p116
aVbecause of how they are socialized and trained,
p117
aVUnited Nations officials, donors, diplomats,
p118
aVthe staff of most nongovernmental organizations,
p119
aVthey interpret continued fighting and massacres as a top-down problem.
p120
aVTo them, the violence they see
p121
aVis the consequence of tensions between President Kabila
p122
aVand various national opponents,
p123
aVand tensions between Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.
p124
aVIn addition, these international  peacebuilders view local conflicts
p125
aVas simply the result of national and international tensions,
p126
aVinsufficient state authority,
p127
aVand what they call the Congolese people's so-called inherent penchant for violence.
p128
aa(lp129
VThe dominant culture also constructs intervention
p130
aVat the national and international levels
p131
aVas the only natural and legitimate task for United Nations staffers and diplomats.
p132
aVAnd it elevates the organization of general elections,
p133
aVwhich is now a sort of cure-all,
p134
aVas the most crucial state reconstruction mechanism
p135
aVover more effective state-building approaches.
p136
aVAnd that happens not only in Congo but also in many other conflict zones.
p137
aa(lp138
VBut let's dig deeper,
p139
aVinto the other main sources of violence.
p140
aVIn Congo, continuing violence
p141
aVis motivated not only by the national and international causes
p142
aVbut also by longstanding bottom-up agendas
p143
aVwhose main instigators are villagers, traditional chiefs,
p144
aVcommunity chiefs or ethnic leaders.
p145
aVMany conflicts revolve around political, social and economic stakes
p146
aVthat are distinctively local.
p147
aVFor instance, there is a lot of competition
p148
aVat the village or district level
p149
aVover who can be chief of village or chief of territory
p150
aVaccording to traditional law,
p151
aVand who can control the distribution of land
p152
aVand the exploitation of local mining sites.
p153
aVThis competition often results in localized fighting,
p154
aVfor instance in one village or territory,
p155
aVand quite frequently, it escalates into generalized fighting,
p156
aVso across a whole province,
p157
aVand even at times into neighboring countries.
p158
aa(lp159
VTake the conflict between Congolese  of Rwandan descent
p160
aVand the so-called indigenous  communities of the Kivus.
p161
aVThis conflict started in the 1930s during Belgian colonization,
p162
aVwhen both communities competed over access to land and to local power.
p163
aVThen, in 1960, after Congolese independence,
p164
aVit escalated because each camp tried to align with national politicians,
p165
aVbut still to advance their local agendas.
p166
aVAnd then, at the time of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,
p167
aVthese local actors allied with Congolese and Rwandan armed groups,
p168
aVbut still to advance their local agendas in the provinces of the Kivus.
p169
aVAnd since then, these local disputes over land and local power
p170
aVhave fueled violence,
p171
aVand they have regularly jeopardized
p172
aVthe national and international settlements.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo we can wonder why in these circumstances
p175
aVthe international peacebuilders have failed to help implement
p176
aVlocal peacebuilding programs.
p177
aVAnd the answer is that international interveners
p178
aVdeem the resolution of grassroots conflict
p179
aVan unimportant, unfamiliar, and illegitimate task.
p180
aVThe very idea of becoming involved at the local level clashes fundamentally
p181
aVwith existing cultural norms,
p182
aVand it threatens key organizational interests.
p183
aVFor instance, the very identity of the United Nations
p184
aVas this macro-level diplomatic organization
p185
aVwould be upended if it were to refocus on local conflicts.
p186
aVAnd the result is that neither the internal resistance
p187
aVto the dominant ways of working
p188
aVnor the external shocks
p189
aVhave managed to convince international actors that they should reevaluate
p190
aVtheir understanding of violence and intervention.
p191
aVAnd so far, there have been only very few exceptions.
p192
aVThere have been exceptions, but only very few exceptions,
p193
aVto this broad pattern.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo to wrap up, the story I just told you
p196
aVis a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture
p197
aVshapes the intervener's understanding of what the causes of violence are,
p198
aVhow peace is made,
p199
aVand what interventions should accomplish.
p200
aVThese understandings enable international peacebuilders
p201
aVto ignore the micro-level foundations
p202
aVthat are so necessary for sustainable peace.
p203
aVThe resulting inattention to local conflicts
p204
aVleads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short term
p205
aVand potential war resumption in the long term.
p206
aVAnd what's fascinating is that this analysis
p207
aVhelps us to better understand many cases of lasting conflict
p208
aVand international intervention failures, in Africa and elsewhere.
p209
aVLocal conflicts fuel violence in most war and post-war environments,
p210
aVfrom Afghanistan to Sudan to Timor-Leste,
p211
aVand in the rare cases where there have been comprehensive,
p212
aVbottom-up peacebuilding initiatives,
p213
aVthese attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable.
p214
aVOne of the best examples is the contrast
p215
aVbetween the relatively peaceful situation in Somaliland,
p216
aVwhich benefited from sustained grassroots peacebuilding initiatives,
p217
aVand the violence prevalent in the rest of Somalia,
p218
aVwhere peacebuilding has been mostly top-down.
p219
aVAnd there are several other cases
p220
aVin which local, grassroots conflict resolution
p221
aVhas made a crucial difference.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo if we want international peacebuilding to work,
p224
aVin addition to any top-down intervention,
p225
aVconflicts must be resolved from the bottom up.
p226
aVAnd again, it's not that national and international tensions don't matter.
p227
aVThey do.
p228
aVAnd it's not that national and international peacebuilding
p229
aVisn't necessary.
p230
aVIt is.
p231
aVInstead, it is that both macro-level and micro-level peacebuilding are needed
p232
aVto make peace sustainable,
p233
aVand local nongovernmental organizations,
p234
aVlocal authorities and  civil society representatives
p235
aVshould be the main actors in the bottom-up process.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo of course, there are obstacles.
p238
aVLocal actors often lack the funding
p239
aVand sometimes the logistical means and the technical capacity
p240
aVto implement effective, local peacebuilding programs.
p241
aVSo international actors should expand their funding and support
p242
aVfor local conflict resolution.
p243
aa(lp244
VAs for Congo, what can be done?
p245
aVAfter two decades of conflict and the deaths of millions,
p246
aVit's clear that we need to change our approach.
p247
aVBased on my field research,
p248
aVI believe that international and Congolese actors
p249
aVshould pay more attention to the resolution of land conflict
p250
aVand the promotion of inter-community reconciliation.
p251
aVSo for instance, in the province of the Kivus,
p252
aVthe Life and Peace Institute and its Congolese partners
p253
aVhave set up inter-community forums
p254
aVto discuss the specifics of local conflicts over land,
p255
aVand these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence.
p256
aVThat's the kind of program that is sorely needed
p257
aVthroughout eastern Congo.
p258
aVIt's with programs like this
p259
aVthat we can help people like Isabelle and her husband.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo these will not be magic wands,
p262
aVbut because they take into account deeply rooted causes of the violence,
p263
aVthey could definitely be game-changers.
p264
aa(lp265
VThank you.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)

VHere are some images of clusters of galaxies.
p5
aVThey're exactly what they sound like.
p6
aVThey are these huge collections of galaxies,
p7
aVbound together by their mutual gravity.
p8
aVSo most of the points that you see on the screen
p9
aVare not individual stars,
p10
aVbut collections of stars, or galaxies.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow, by showing you some of these images,
p13
aVI hope that you will quickly see that
p14
aVgalaxy clusters are these beautiful objects,
p15
aVbut more than that,
p16
aVI think galaxy clusters are mysterious,
p17
aVthey are surprising,
p18
aVand they're useful.
p19
aVUseful as the universe's most massive laboratories.
p20
aVAnd as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters
p21
aVis to describe the experiments
p22
aVthat you can do with them.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd I think there are four major types,
p25
aVand the first type that I want to describe
p26
aVis probing the very big.
p27
aVSo, how big?
p28
aVWell, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.
p29
aVIt is so massive that the light passing through it
p30
aVis being bent, it's being distorted
p31
aVby the extreme gravity of this cluster.
p32
aVAnd, in fact, if you look very carefully
p33
aVyou'll be able to see rings around this cluster.
p34
aVNow, to give you a number,
p35
aVthis particular galaxy cluster
p36
aVhas a mass of over one million billion suns.
p37
aVIt's just mind-boggling how  massive these systems can get.
p38
aVBut more than their mass,
p39
aVthey have this additional feature.
p40
aVThey are essentially isolated systems,
p41
aVso if we like, we can think of them
p42
aVas a scaled-down version of the entire universe.
p43
aVAnd many of the questions that we might have
p44
aVabout the universe at large scales,
p45
aVsuch as, how does gravity work?
p46
aVmight be answered by studying these systems.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo that was very big.
p49
aVThe second things is very hot.
p50
aVOkay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster,
p51
aVand I subtract away all of the starlight,
p52
aVwhat I'm left with is this big, blue blob.
p53
aVThis is in false color.
p54
aVIt's actually X-ray light that we're seeing.
p55
aVAnd the question is, if it's not galaxies,
p56
aVwhat is emitting this light?
p57
aVThe answer is hot gas,
p58
aVmillion-degree gas \u2014
p59
aVin fact, it's plasma.
p60
aVAnd the reason why it's so hot
p61
aVgoes back to the previous slide.
p62
aVThe extreme gravity of these systems
p63
aVis accelerating particles of gas to great speeds,
p64
aVand great speeds means great temperatures.
p65
aVSo this is the main idea,
p66
aVbut science is a rough draft.
p67
aVThere are many basic properties about this plasma
p68
aVthat still confuse us,
p69
aVstill puzzle us,
p70
aVand still push our understanding
p71
aVof the physics of the very hot.
p72
aa(lp73
VThird thing: probing the very small.
p74
aVNow, to explain this, I need to tell you
p75
aVa very disturbing fact.
p76
aVMost of the universe's matter
p77
aVis not made up of atoms.
p78
aVYou were lied to.
p79
aVMost of it is made up of something  very, very mysterious,
p80
aVwhich we call dark matter.
p81
aVDark matter is something that  doesn't like to interact very much,
p82
aVexcept through gravity,
p83
aVand of course we would like to learn more about it.
p84
aVIf you're a particle physicist,
p85
aVyou want to know what happens  when we smash things together.
p86
aVAnd dark matter is no exception.
p87
aa(lp88
VWell, how do we do this?
p89
aVTo answer that question,
p90
aVI'm going to have to ask another one,
p91
aVwhich is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide?
p92
aVHere is an image.
p93
aVSince galaxy clusters are representative
p94
aVslices of the universe, scaled-down versions.
p95
aVThey are mostly made up of dark matter,
p96
aVand that's what you see in this bluish purple.
p97
aVThe red represents the hot gas,
p98
aVand, of course, you can see many galaxies.
p99
aVWhat's happened is a particle accelerator
p100
aVat a huge, huge scale.
p101
aVAnd this is very important,
p102
aVbecause what it means is that very, very small
p103
aVeffects that might be difficult to detect in the lab,
p104
aVmight be compounded and compounded
p105
aVinto something that we could  possibly observe in nature.
p106
aVSo, it's very funny.
p107
aVThe reason why galaxy clusters
p108
aVcan teach us about dark matter,
p109
aVthe reason why galaxy clusters
p110
aVcan teach us about the physics of the very small,
p111
aVis precisely because they are so very big.
p112
aa(lp113
VFourth thing: the physics of the very strange.
p114
aVCertainly what I've said so far is crazy.
p115
aVOkay, if there's anything stranger
p116
aVI think it has to be dark energy.
p117
aVIf I throw a ball into the air,
p118
aVI expect it to go up.
p119
aVWhat I don't expect is that it go up
p120
aVat an ever-increasing rate.
p121
aVSimilarly, cosmologists understand why
p122
aVthe universe is expanding.
p123
aVThey don't understand why it's expanding
p124
aVat an ever-increasing rate.
p125
aVThey give the cause of this
p126
aVaccelerated expansion a name,
p127
aVand they call it dark energy.
p128
aVAnd, again, we want to learn more about it.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, one particular question that we have is,
p131
aVhow does dark energy affect the universe
p132
aVat the largest scales?
p133
aVDepending on how strong it is,
p134
aVmaybe structure forms faster or slower.
p135
aVWell, the problem with the large-scale structure
p136
aVof the universe is that it's horribly complicated.
p137
aVHere is a computer simulation.
p138
aVAnd we need a way to simplify it.
p139
aVWell, I like to think about this using an analogy.
p140
aVIf I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic,
p141
aVthe most important thing to do
p142
aVis not to model the little positions
p143
aVof every single little piece of the boat that broke off.
p144
aVThe most important thing to do is
p145
aVto track the two biggest parts.
p146
aVSimilarly, I can learn a lot about the universe
p147
aVat the largest scales
p148
aVby tracking its biggest pieces
p149
aVand those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo, as I come to a close,
p152
aVyou might feel slightly cheated.
p153
aVI mean, I began by talking about
p154
aVhow galaxy clusters are useful,
p155
aVand I've given some reasons,
p156
aVbut what is their use really?
p157
aVWell, to answer this,
p158
aVI want to give you a quote by Henry Ford
p159
aVwhen he was asked about cars.
p160
aVHe had this to say:
p161
aV"If I had asked people what they wanted,
p162
aVthey would have said faster horses."
p163
aVToday, we as a society are faced
p164
aVwith many, many difficult problems.
p165
aVAnd the solutions to these  problems are not obvious.
p166
aVThey are not faster horses.
p167
aVThey will require an enormous amount of
p168
aVscientific ingenuity.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo, yes, we need to focus,
p171
aVyes, we need to concentrate,
p172
aVbut we also need to remember that
p173
aVinnovation, ingenuity, inspiration \u2014
p174
aVthese things come
p175
aVwhen we broaden our field of vision
p176
aVwhen we step back
p177
aVwhen we zoom out.
p178
aVAnd I can't think of a better way to do this than
p179
aVby studying the universe around us. Thanks.

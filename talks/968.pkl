VSo I want to tell you a story \u2014 an encouraging story \u2014
p5
aVabout addressing
p6
aVdesperation, depression and despair in Afghanistan,
p7
aVand what we have learned from it,
p8
aVand how to help people
p9
aVto overcome traumatic experiences
p10
aVand how to help them to regain some confidence
p11
aVin the time ahead \u2014 in the future \u2014
p12
aVand how to participate again in everyday life.
p13
aVSo, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst,
p14
aVand I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance,
p15
aVon an assignment for Medica Mondiale.
p16
aVJung in Afghanistan \u2014
p17
aVyou get the picture.
p18
aVAfghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world,
p19
aVand 70 percent of the people are illiterate.
p20
aVWar and malnutrition kills people
p21
aVtogether with hope.
p22
aVYou may know this from the media,
p23
aVbut what you may not know
p24
aVis that the average age of the Afghan people is 17 years old,
p25
aVwhich means they grow up in such an environment
p26
aVand \u2014 I repeat myself \u2014
p27
aVin 30 years of war.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo this translates
p30
aVinto ongoing violence,
p31
aVforeign interests, bribery,
p32
aVdrugs, ethnic conflicts,
p33
aVbad health, shame, fear
p34
aVand cumulative traumatic experiences.
p35
aVLocal and foreign military
p36
aVare supposed to build peace together with the donors
p37
aVand the governmental and non-governmental organizations.
p38
aVAnd people had hope, yes,
p39
aVbut until they realized
p40
aVtheir situation worsens every day \u2014
p41
aVeither because they are being killed
p42
aVor because, somehow,
p43
aVthey are poorer than eight years ago.
p44
aVOne figure for that:
p45
aV54 percent of the children under the age of five years
p46
aVsuffer from malnutrition.
p47
aa(lp48
VYet, there is hope.
p49
aVOne day a man told me,
p50
aV"My future does not look brilliant,
p51
aVbut I want to have a brilliant future for my son."
p52
aVThis is a picture I took in 2005,
p53
aVwalking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul,
p54
aVand for me it's a symbolic picture
p55
aVof an open future for a young generation.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo, doctors prescribe medication.
p58
aVAnd donors
p59
aVare supposed to bring peace
p60
aVby building schools and roads.
p61
aVMilitary collect weapons,
p62
aVand depression stays intact.
p63
aVWhy?
p64
aVBecause people don't have tools
p65
aVto cope with it, to get over it.
p66
aVSo, soon after my arrival,
p67
aVI had confirmed something which I had already known;
p68
aVthat my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe, yes.
p69
aVHowever, what can wound us
p70
aVand our reaction to those wounds \u2014
p71
aVthey are universal.
p72
aVAnd the big challenge
p73
aVwas how to understand the meaning of the symptom
p74
aVin this specific cultural context.
p75
aVAfter a counseling session, a woman said to me,
p76
aV"Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again,
p77
aVand I want to participate again
p78
aVin my family life."
p79
aVThis was very important,
p80
aVbecause the family is central
p81
aVin Afghans' social system.
p82
aa(lp83
VNo one can survive alone.
p84
aVAnd if people feel used, worthless and ashamed,
p85
aVbecause something horrible has happened to them,
p86
aVthen they retreat, and they fall into social isolation,
p87
aVand they do not dare to tell this evil
p88
aVto other people or to their loved ones,
p89
aVbecause they do not want to burden them.
p90
aVAnd very often violence is a way to cope with it.
p91
aVTraumatized people also easily lose control \u2014
p92
aVsymptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks \u2014
p93
aVso people are in a constant fear
p94
aVthat those horrible feelings of that traumatic event
p95
aVmight come back unexpectedly,
p96
aVsuddenly,
p97
aVand they cannot control it.
p98
aVTo compensate this loss of inner control,
p99
aVthey try to control the outside,
p100
aVvery understandably \u2014 mostly the family \u2014
p101
aVand unfortunately,
p102
aVthis fits very well
p103
aVinto the traditional side,
p104
aVregressive side, repressive side,
p105
aVrestrictive side of the cultural context.
p106
aVSo, husbands start beating wives,
p107
aVmothers and fathers beat their children,
p108
aVand afterward, they feel awful.
p109
aVThey did not want to do this, it just happened \u2014
p110
aVthey lost control.
p111
aVThe desperate try
p112
aVto restore order and normality,
p113
aVand if we are not able to cut this circle of violence,
p114
aVit will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt.
p115
aVAnd partly this is already happening.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo everybody needs a sense for the future,
p118
aVand the Afghan sense of the future
p119
aVis shattered.
p120
aVBut let me repeat the words of the woman.
p121
aV"Because you have felt me,
p122
aVI can feel myself again."
p123
aVSo the key here is empathy.
p124
aVSomebody has to be a witness
p125
aVto what has happened to you.
p126
aVSomebody has to feel how you felt.
p127
aVAnd somebody has to see you and listen to you.
p128
aVEverybody must be able
p129
aVto know what he or she has experienced is true,
p130
aVand this only goes with another person.
p131
aVSo everybody must be able to say,
p132
aV"This happened to me, and it did this with me,
p133
aVbut I'm able to live with it, to cope with it,
p134
aVand to learn from it.
p135
aVAnd I want to engage myself
p136
aVin the bright future for my children
p137
aVand the children of my children,
p138
aVand I will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter," \u2014
p139
aVwhat happens too often in Afghanistan.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo something can be done,
p142
aVeven in such extreme environments as Afghanistan.
p143
aVAnd I started thinking about a counseling program.
p144
aVBut, of course, I needed help and funds.
p145
aVAnd one evening,
p146
aVI was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul,
p147
aVand he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan.
p148
aVAnd I explained to him quickly,
p149
aVI would train psycho-social counselors,
p150
aVI would open centers, and I explained to him why.
p151
aVThis man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening
p152
aVand said, "If you want to do this, call me."
p153
aVAt that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo, I was able to launch a three-year project with Caritas Germany,
p156
aVand we trained 30 Afghan women and men,
p157
aVand we opened 15 counseling centers in Kabul.
p158
aVThis was our sign \u2014 it's hand-painted,
p159
aVand we had 45 all over Kabul.
p160
aVEleven thousand people came \u2014 more than that.
p161
aVAnd 70 percent regained their lives.
p162
aVThis was a very exciting time,
p163
aVdeveloping this with my wonderful Afghan team.
p164
aVAnd they are working with me up to today.
p165
aVWe developed a culturally-sensitive
p166
aVpsycho-social counseling approach.
p167
aVSo, from 2008 up until today,
p168
aVa substantial change and step forward
p169
aVhas been taking place.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe European Union delegation in Kabul
p172
aVcame into this and hired me to work
p173
aVinside the Ministry of Public Health,
p174
aVto lobby this approach \u2014
p175
aVwe succeeded.
p176
aVWe revised the mental health component
p177
aVof the primary health care services
p178
aVby adding psycho-social care
p179
aVand psycho-social counselors to the system.
p180
aVThis means, certainly, to retrain all health staff.
p181
aVBut for that, we already have the training manuals,
p182
aVwhich are approved by the Ministry
p183
aVand moreover, this approach is now part
p184
aVof the mental health strategy in Afghanistan.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo we also have implemented it already
p187
aVin some selected clinics in three provinces,
p188
aVand you are the first to see the results.
p189
aVWe wanted to know if what is being done is effective.
p190
aVAnd here you can see
p191
aVthe patients all had symptoms of depression,
p192
aVmoderate and severe.
p193
aVAnd the red line is the treatment as usual \u2014
p194
aVmedication with a medical doctor.
p195
aVAnd all the symptoms
p196
aVstayed the same or even got worse.
p197
aVAnd the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only,
p198
aVwithout medication.
p199
aVAnd you can see the symptoms almost completely go away,
p200
aVand the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly,
p201
aVwhich is explicable,
p202
aVbecause you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses,
p203
aVbut you can learn how to cope with them.
p204
aVSo this makes us very happy,
p205
aVbecause now we also have some evidence
p206
aVthat this is working.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo here you see,
p209
aVthis is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan,
p210
aVand every morning it looks like this all over.
p211
aVAnd doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients,
p212
aVbut now this will change.
p213
aVThey go to the clinics,
p214
aVbecause they want to cure their immediate symptoms,
p215
aVand they will find somebody to talk to
p216
aVand discuss these issues
p217
aVand talk about what is burdening them
p218
aVand find solutions, develop their resources,
p219
aVlearn tools to solve their family conflicts
p220
aVand gain some confidence in the future.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd I would like to share one short vignette.
p223
aVOne Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor,
p224
aV"If we were to have met some years ago,
p225
aVthen we would have killed each other.
p226
aVAnd now you are helping me
p227
aVto regain some confidence in the future."
p228
aVAnd another counselor said to me after the training,
p229
aV"You know, I never knew why I survived the killings in my village,
p230
aVbut now I know,
p231
aVbecause I am part of a nucleus
p232
aVof a new peaceful society in Afghanistan."
p233
aVSo I believe this kept me running.
p234
aVAnd this is a really emancipatory and political contribution
p235
aVto peace and reconciliation.
p236
aVAnd also \u2014 I think \u2014
p237
aVwithout psycho-social therapy,
p238
aVand without considering this
p239
aVin all humanitarian projects,
p240
aVwe cannot build-up civil societies.
p241
aa(lp242
VI thought it was an idea worth spreading,
p243
aVand I think it must be,
p244
aVcan be, could be replicated elsewhere.
p245
aa(lp246
VI thank you for your attention.
p247

VWhen I moved to Harare in 1985,
p5
aVsocial justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
p6
aVThe new government emerged from a long war of independence
p7
aVand immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda:
p8
aVhealth care services, primary education
p9
aVbecame essentially free.
p10
aVA massive expansion of rural health centers
p11
aVplaced roughly 80 percent of the population
p12
aVless than a two-hour walk from these facilities,
p13
aVa truly remarkable accomplishment.
p14
aVIn 1980, the year of independence,
p15
aV25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized.
p16
aVBy 1990, a mere decade later,
p17
aVthis proportion stood at 80 percent.
p18
aa(lp19
VI felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation,
p20
aVa revolution.
p21
aVThe excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable.
p22
aVWorking side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans \u2014
p23
aVscientists, doctors, activists \u2014
p24
aVI felt connected not only to an African independence movement,
p25
aVbut to a global progressive public health movement.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut there were daunting challenges.
p28
aVZimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived.
p29
aVI had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s,
p30
aVwhen I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but \u2014
p31
aVwe had no idea what lay in store for Africa.
p32
aVInfection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there.
p33
aVThese would soar
p34
aVto one out of every four adults
p35
aVby the time I left Harare 17 years later.
p36
aVBy the mid-1990s,
p37
aVI'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life
p38
aVthat they were HIV-positive.
p39
aVI saw colleagues and friends die,
p40
aVmy students, hospital patients, die.
p41
aa(lp42
VIn response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
p43
aVWe did condom demonstrations.
p44
aVWe launched school education and workplace interventions.
p45
aVWe did research. We counseled the partners of infected men
p46
aVabout how to protect themselves.
p47
aVWe worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best.
p48
aVI was providing excellent treatment,
p49
aVsuch as it was.
p50
aVBut I was not talking about structural change.
p51
aa(lp52
VFormer UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly
p53
aVabout his personal failure
p54
aVleading to the Rwandan genocide.
p55
aVIn 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department.
p56
aVAt a 10-year memorial for the genocide,
p57
aVhe reflected, "I believed at the time I was doing my best,
p58
aVbut I realized after the genocide
p59
aVthat there was more I could and should have done
p60
aVto sound the alarm and rally support."
p61
aa(lp62
VThe AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared,
p63
aVand today, when the World Health Organization estimates
p64
aVthat 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease,
p65
aVI'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret
p66
aVat not having done more earlier.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut while living in Zimbabwe,
p69
aVI didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one.
p70
aVI was there for my technical skills,
p71
aVboth my clinical and my research epidemiology skills.
p72
aVAnd in my mind, my job was to take care of patients
p73
aVand to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission,
p74
aVand I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus.
p75
aVI was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk
p76
aVof getting and dying of AIDS.
p77
aVAnd on the sugar plantations,
p78
aVwhich really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms
p79
aVthan any modern enterprise,
p80
aV60 percent of pregnant women
p81
aVtested HIV-positive.
p82
aa(lp83
VI worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure
p84
aVbut instead related to a culture of male superiority,
p85
aVto forced migrant labor and to colonialism.
p86
aVWhites were largely unscathed.
p87
aa(lp88
VAs health professionals,
p89
aVour tools were pitifully weak:
p90
aVimploring people to change their individual behaviors,
p91
aVuse condoms, reduce number of partners.
p92
aVInfection rates climbed,
p93
aVand when treatment became available in the West,
p94
aVtreatment that remains our most potent weapon
p95
aVagainst this virus,
p96
aVit was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa.
p97
aVI didn't speak out
p98
aVabout the unequal access to these life-saving drugs
p99
aVor about the underlying economic and political systems
p100
aVthat were driving infection rates
p101
aVin such huge swaths of the population.
p102
aVI rationalized my silence
p103
aVby reminding myself that I was a guest in the country,
p104
aVthat sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out,
p105
aVkeep me from doing good work,
p106
aVtaking care of my patients,
p107
aVdoing much-needed research.
p108
aVSo I didn't speak out
p109
aVabout the government's early stance on AIDS.
p110
aVI didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.
p111
aa(lp112
VMany doctors, health professionals,
p113
aVmay think I did nothing wrong.
p114
aVOur pact with our patients,
p115
aVthe Hippocratic Oath and its variants,
p116
aVis about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship.
p117
aVAnd I did everything I could
p118
aVfor each and every patient of mine.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut I knew
p121
aVthat epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society,
p122
aVreflecting not only biology,
p123
aVbut more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion,
p124
aVdiscrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more.
p125
aVIt was true of AIDS.
p126
aVIt was true just recently of Ebola.
p127
aVMedical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer,
p128
aVwho worked on AIDS in Haiti,
p129
aVcall this structural violence:
p130
aVstructural because inequities are embedded
p131
aVin the political and economic organization of our social world,
p132
aVoften in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power;
p133
aVand violence because its impact \u2014
p134
aVpremature deaths, suffering, illness \u2014 is violent.
p135
aVWe do little for our patients
p136
aVif we fail to recognize
p137
aVthese social injustices.
p138
aVSounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right,
p139
aVand it's how we may rally support
p140
aVto break through and create real change together.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo these days, I'm not staying quiet.
p143
aVI'm speaking up about a lot of things,
p144
aVeven when it makes listeners uncomfortable,
p145
aVeven when it makes me uncomfortable.
p146
aVAnd a lot of this is about racial disparities
p147
aVand institutionalized racism,
p148
aVthings that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore,
p149
aVcertainly not in the practice of medicine
p150
aVor public health.
p151
aVBut we have them,
p152
aVand we pay for them in lives cut short.
p153
aVThat's why sounding the alarm
p154
aVabout the impact of racism on health in the United States,
p155
aVthe ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence
p156
aVthat people of color face,
p157
aVcompounded by our tragic legacy
p158
aVof 250 years of slavery,
p159
aV90 years of Jim Crow
p160
aVand 60 years of imperfect equality,
p161
aVsounding the alarm about this
p162
aVis central to doing my job right
p163
aVas New York City's Health Commissioner.
p164
aVIn New York City, premature mortality \u2014 that's death before the age of 65 \u2014
p165
aVis 50 percent higher for black men than white ones.
p166
aVA black woman in 2012
p167
aVfaced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to childbirth
p168
aVas a white woman.
p169
aVAnd though we've made enormous strides
p170
aVin reducing infant mortality rates,
p171
aVa black baby still faces
p172
aVnearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life
p173
aVas compared to a white baby.
p174
aa(lp175
VNew York City's not exceptional.
p176
aVThese statistics are paralleled
p177
aVby statistics found across the United States.
p178
aVA recent New York Times analysis
p179
aVreported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country.
p180
aVThey noted that more than one
p181
aVout of every six black men
p182
aVwho today should be between the ages of 25 and 54 years
p183
aVhave disappeared from daily life,
p184
aVlost either to prison or premature death.
p185
aVThere is great injustice
p186
aVin the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men,
p187
aVthe focus of recent protests under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.
p188
aVBut we have to remember
p189
aVthat enduring and disparate rates
p190
aVand the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions \u2014
p191
aVheart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV \u2014
p192
aVdiseases that may kill slowly and quietly
p193
aVand take even more black lives prematurely.
p194
aa(lp195
VAs the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded,
p196
aVI felt frustrated and angry
p197
aVthat the medical community
p198
aVhas been reluctant to even use the word "racism"
p199
aVin our research and our work.
p200
aVYou've probably felt something every time I've said it.
p201
aVOur medical students held die-ins in their white coats,
p202
aVbut the medical community has largely stood by passively
p203
aVas ongoing discrimination continues to affect
p204
aVthe disease profile and mortality.
p205
aVAnd I worry
p206
aVthat the trend towards personalized and precision medicine,
p207
aVlooking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment,
p208
aVmay inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture,
p209
aVthat it is the daily context,
p210
aVwhere a person lives, grows,
p211
aVworks, loves,
p212
aVthat most importantly determines population health,
p213
aVand for too many of us, poor health.
p214
aa(lp215
VAs health professionals in our daily work,
p216
aVwhether in the clinic or doing research,
p217
aVwe are witness to great injustice:
p218
aVthe homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice
p219
aVbecause he has more pressing priorities;
p220
aVthe transgender youth who is contemplating suicide
p221
aVbecause our society is just so harsh;
p222
aVthe single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible
p223
aVfor the poor health of her child.
p224
aa(lp225
VOur role as health professionals
p226
aVis not just to treat our patients
p227
aVbut to sound the alarm
p228
aVand advocate for change.
p229
aVRightfully or not,
p230
aVour societal position gives our voices great credibility,
p231
aVand we shouldn't waste that.
p232
aa(lp233
VI regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe,
p234
aVand I've promised myself
p235
aVthat as New York City's Health Commissioner,
p236
aVI will use every opportunity I have
p237
aVto sound the alarm
p238
aVand rally support for health equity.
p239
aVI will speak out against racism,
p240
aVand I hope you will join me,
p241
aVand I will join you when you speak out against sexism
p242
aVor any other form of inequality.
p243
aVIt's time for us to rise up
p244
aVand collectively speak up
p245
aVabout structural inequality.
p246
aVWe don't have to have all the answers
p247
aVto call for change.
p248
aVWe just need courage.
p249
aVThe health of our patients,
p250
aVthe health of us all, depends on it.

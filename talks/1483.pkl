VGood evening.
p5
aa(lp6
VWe are in this wonderful
p7
aVopen-air amphitheater
p8
aVand we are enjoying ourselves
p9
aVin that mild evening
p10
aVtemperature tonight,
p11
aVbut when Qatar will host
p12
aVthe football World Cup
p13
aV10 years from now,
p14
aV2022,
p15
aVwe already heard it will be
p16
aVin the hot, very hot and sunny
p17
aVsummer months of June and July.
p18
aVAnd when Qatar has been assigned
p19
aVto the World Cup all, many
p20
aVpeople around the world have been
p21
aVwondering, how would it be
p22
aVpossible that football players
p23
aVshow spectacular football,
p24
aVrun around in this desert
p25
aVclimate? How would it be
p26
aVpossible that spectators sit,
p27
aVenjoy themselves in open-air
p28
aVstadia in this hot environment?
p29
aa(lp30
VTogether with the architects of
p31
aVAlbert Speer & Partner, our engineers
p32
aVfrom Transsolar have been
p33
aVsupporting, have been developing
p34
aVopen-air stadia based on 100 percent
p35
aVsolar power, on 100 percent solar cooling.
p36
aa(lp37
VLet me tell you about that,
p38
aVbut let me start with comfort.
p39
aVLet me start with the aspect
p40
aVof comfort, because many people
p41
aVare confusing
p42
aVambient temperature
p43
aVwith thermal comfort.
p44
aa(lp45
VWe are used to looking at charts like
p46
aVthat, and you see this red line
p47
aVshowing the air temperature
p48
aVin June and July, and yes, that's right,
p49
aVit's picking up to 45 degrees C.
p50
aVIt's actually very hot.
p51
aVBut air temperature is not
p52
aVthe full set of climatic
p53
aVparameters which define comfort.
p54
aa(lp55
VLet me show you analysis
p56
aVa colleague of mine did looking
p57
aVon different football, World Cups,
p58
aVOlympic Games around the world,
p59
aVlooking on the comfort
p60
aVand analyzing the comfort
p61
aVpeople have perceived at these
p62
aVdifferent sport activities,
p63
aVand let me start with Mexico.
p64
aa(lp65
VMexico temperature has been, air
p66
aVtemperature has been something between
p67
aV15, up to 30 degrees C, and people
p68
aVenjoyed themselves.
p69
aVIt was a very comfortable game
p70
aVin Mexico City. Have a look.
p71
aVOrlando, same kind of stadium,
p72
aVopen-air stadium. People have
p73
aVbeen sitting in the strong sun,
p74
aVin the very high humidity
p75
aVin the afternoon, and they
p76
aVdid not enjoy. It was not comfortable.
p77
aVThe air temperature was not too high, but it was not
p78
aVcomfortable during these games.
p79
aa(lp80
VWhat about Seoul? Seoul, because
p81
aVof broadcast rights, all the
p82
aVgames have been in the late
p83
aVafternoon. Sun has already been
p84
aVset, so the games have been
p85
aVperceived as comfortable.
p86
aa(lp87
VWhat about Athens? Mediterranean
p88
aVclimate, but in the sun it was
p89
aVnot comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd we know that from Spain,
p92
aVwe know that "sol y sombra."
p93
aVIf you have a ticket, and you
p94
aVget a ticket for the shade,
p95
aVyou pay more, because you're
p96
aVin a more comfortable environment.
p97
aa(lp98
VWhat about Beijing?
p99
aVIt's again, sun in the day
p100
aVand high humidity,
p101
aVand it was not comfortable.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo if I overlay, and if you
p104
aVoverlay all these comfort
p105
aVenvelopes, what we see is,
p106
aVin all these places, air temperature has
p107
aVbeen ranging something from 25
p108
aVto 35, and if you go on
p109
aVthe line, 30, of 30 degrees C
p110
aVambient temperatures. If you
p111
aVgo along that line you see
p112
aVthere has been all kind of
p113
aVcomfort, all kinds of perceived
p114
aVoutdoor comfort, ranging from
p115
aVvery comfortable
p116
aVto very uncomfortable.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo why is that?
p119
aVThis is because there are
p120
aVmore parameters influencing
p121
aVour thermal comfort, which is
p122
aVthe sun, the direct sun,
p123
aVthe diffuse sun, which is wind,
p124
aVstrong wind, mild wind, which is
p125
aVair humidity, which is
p126
aVthe radiant temperature of the
p127
aVsurroundings where we are in.
p128
aVAnd this is air temperature.
p129
aa(lp130
VAll these parameters go into
p131
aVthe comfort feeling of our
p132
aVhuman body, and scientists
p133
aVhave developed a parameter,
p134
aVwhich is the perceived
p135
aVtemperature, where all these
p136
aVparameters go in and help
p137
aVdesigners to understand
p138
aVwhich is the driving parameter
p139
aVthat I feel comfort or that
p140
aVI don't feel comfort.
p141
aVWhich is the driving parameter
p142
aVwhich gives me a perceived
p143
aVtemperature? And these parameters,
p144
aVthese climatic parameters are
p145
aVrelated to the human metabolism.
p146
aa(lp147
VBecause of our metabolism,
p148
aVwe as human beings,
p149
aVwe produce heat.
p150
aVI'm excited, I'm talking to you,
p151
aVI'm probably producing
p152
aV150 watts
p153
aVat the moment. You are sitting,
p154
aVyou are relaxed, you're looking
p155
aVat me. It's probably 100
p156
aVwatts each person is producing,
p157
aVand we need to get rid of that
p158
aVenergy. I need, with my body,
p159
aVto get rid of the energy, and
p160
aVthe harder it is for myself,
p161
aVfor my body, to get rid of the
p162
aVenergy, the less comfort I feel.
p163
aVThat's it. And if I don't
p164
aVget rid of the energy,
p165
aVI will die.
p166
aa(lp167
VIf we overlay what happens
p168
aVduring the football World Cup,
p169
aVwhat will happen in June, July,
p170
aVwe will see, yes, air
p171
aVtemperature will be much higher,
p172
aVbut because the games and
p173
aVthe plays will be in the afternoon,
p174
aVit's probably the same comfort
p175
aVrating we've found in other
p176
aVplaces which has perceived
p177
aVas non-comfortable.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo we sat together with a team
p180
aVwhich prepared the Bid Book, or goal,
p181
aVthat we said, let's aim
p182
aVfor perceived temperature,
p183
aVfor outdoor comfort in this range,
p184
aVwhich is perceived with a
p185
aVtemperature of 32 degrees
p186
aVCelsius perceived temperature,
p187
aVwhich is extremely comfortable.
p188
aVPeople would feel really fine
p189
aVin an open outdoor environment.
p190
aa(lp191
VBut what does it mean?
p192
aVIf we just look on what happens,
p193
aVwe see, temperature's too high.
p194
aVIf we apply the best architectural design,
p195
aVclimate engineering design,
p196
aVwe won't get much better.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo we need to do something active.
p199
aVWe need, for instance, to bring
p200
aVin radiant cooling technology,
p201
aVand we need to combine this
p202
aVwith so-called soft conditioning.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd how does it look like in a stadium?
p205
aVSo the stadium has a few
p206
aVelements which create that
p207
aVoutdoor comfort. First of all,
p208
aVit's shading. It needs
p209
aVto protect where the people
p210
aVare sitting against strong
p211
aVand warm wind.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut that's not all what we need
p214
aVto do. We need to use
p215
aVactive systems.
p216
aVInstead of blowing a hurricane
p217
aVof chilled air through the stadium,
p218
aVwe can use radiant
p219
aVcooling technologies, like a
p220
aVfloor heating system where water
p221
aVpipes are embedded in the floor.
p222
aVAnd just by using cold water
p223
aVgoing through the water pipes,
p224
aVyou can release the heat
p225
aVwhich is absorbed during the day
p226
aVin the stadium, so you can
p227
aVcreate that comfort, and then by
p228
aVadding dry air instead of
p229
aVdown-chilled air, the spectators
p230
aVand the football players can
p231
aVadjust to their individual
p232
aVcomfort needs, to their
p233
aVindividual energy balance.
p234
aVThey can adjust and find
p235
aVtheir comfort they need to find.
p236
aa(lp237
VThere are 12 stadia probably
p238
aVto come, but there are
p239
aV32 training pitches where
p240
aVall the individual countries
p241
aVare going to train.
p242
aVWe applied the same concept:
p243
aVshading of the training pitch,
p244
aVusing a shelter against wind,
p245
aVthen using the grass.
p246
aVNatural-watered lawn is a
p247
aVvery good cooling source
p248
aVstabilizing temperature,
p249
aVand using dehumidified air to
p250
aVcreate comfort.
p251
aa(lp252
VBut even the best passive design
p253
aVwouldn't help.
p254
aVWe need active system.
p255
aVAnd how do we do that?
p256
aa(lp257
VOur idea for the bid was
p258
aV100 percent solar cooling,
p259
aVbased on the idea that we use
p260
aVthe roof of the stadia,
p261
aVwe cover the roofs of the stadia
p262
aVwith PV systems.
p263
aVWe don't borrow any energy
p264
aVfrom history.
p265
aVWe are not using fossil energies.
p266
aVWe are not borrowing energy
p267
aVfrom our neighbors.
p268
aVWe're using energy we can harvest
p269
aVon our roofs, and also on the
p270
aVtraining pitches, which will be
p271
aVcovered with large, flexible
p272
aVmembranes, and we will see
p273
aVin the next years an industry
p274
aVcoming up with flexible
p275
aVphotovoltaics, giving
p276
aVthe possibilities of shading
p277
aVagainst strong sun and producing
p278
aVelectric energy in the same time.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd this energy now is
p281
aVharvested throughout the year,
p282
aVsent into the grid,
p283
aVis replacing fossils
p284
aVin the grid, and when I need it
p285
aVfor the cooling, I take it
p286
aVback from the grid and I
p287
aVuse the solar energy
p288
aVwhich I have brought to the grid
p289
aVback when I need
p290
aVit for the solar cooling.
p291
aVAnd I can do that in the first
p292
aVyear and I can balance that
p293
aVin the next 10, and the next
p294
aV20 years, this energy,
p295
aVwhich is necessary to condition
p296
aVa World Cup in Qatar,
p297
aVthe next 20 years, this energy
p298
aVgoes into the grid of Qatar.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo this \u2014 (Applause)
p301
aa(lp302
VThank you very much. (Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VThis is not only useful
p305
aVfor stadia. We can use that also
p306
aVin open-air places and streets,
p307
aVand we've been working on
p308
aVthe City of the Future
p309
aVin Masdar, which is in the
p310
aVUnited Emirates, Abu Dhabi.
p311
aVAnd I had the pleasure to work
p312
aVon the central plaza.
p313
aVAnd the same idea to use there,
p314
aVto create outdoor conditions
p315
aVwhich are perceived
p316
aVas comfortable. People enjoy
p317
aVgoing there instead of going
p318
aVinto a shopping mall, which is
p319
aVchilled down and which is
p320
aVcooled. We wanted to create
p321
aVan outdoor space
p322
aVwhich is so comfortable that
p323
aVpeople can go there in the
p324
aVearly afternoon, even in these
p325
aVsunny and hot summer months,
p326
aVand they can enjoy and meet there
p327
aVwith their families. (Applause)
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd the same concept:
p330
aVshade against the sun,
p331
aVshade against the wind,
p332
aVand use, use and take advantage
p333
aVof the sun you can harvest
p334
aVon your footprint.
p335
aVAnd these beautiful umbrellas.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo I'd like to encourage you
p338
aVto pay attention to your
p339
aVthermal comfort, to your
p340
aVthermal environment,
p341
aVtonight and tomorrow,
p342
aVand if you'd like to learn more
p343
aVabout that, I invite you
p344
aVto go to our website.
p345
aVWe uploaded a very simple
p346
aVperceived temperature calculator
p347
aVwhere you can check out
p348
aVabout your outdoor comfort.
p349
aVAnd I also hope that you
p350
aVshare the idea that
p351
aVif engineers and designers
p352
aVcan use all these different
p353
aVclimatic parameters,
p354
aVit will be possible to create
p355
aVreally good and comfortable
p356
aVoutdoor conditions,
p357
aVto change our thermal perception
p358
aVthat we feel comfortable
p359
aVin an outdoor environment,
p360
aVand we can do that
p361
aVwith the best passive design,
p362
aVbut also using the energy source
p363
aVof the site in Qatar which is
p364
aVthe sun.
p365
aa(lp366
V(Applause)
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you very much. (Applause)

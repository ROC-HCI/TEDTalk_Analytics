VWe are today talking about moral persuasion:
p5
aVWhat is moral and immoral in trying to change people's behaviors
p6
aVby using technology and using design?
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd I don't know what you expect,
p9
aVbut when I was thinking about that issue,
p10
aVI early on realized what I'm not able to give you are answers.
p11
aVI'm not able to tell you what is moral or immoral,
p12
aVbecause we're living in a pluralist society.
p13
aVMy values can be radically different from your values,
p14
aVwhich means that what I consider moral or immoral based on that
p15
aVmight not necessarily be what you consider moral or immoral.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut I also realized there is one thing that I could give you,
p18
aVand that is what this guy behind me gave the world \u2014
p19
aVSocrates.
p20
aVIt is questions.
p21
aVWhat I can do and what I would like to do with you
p22
aVis give you, like that initial question,
p23
aVa set of questions to figure out for yourselves,
p24
aVlayer by layer, like peeling an onion,
p25
aVgetting at the core of what you believe is moral or immoral persuasion.
p26
aVAnd I'd like to do that with a couple of examples of technologies
p27
aVwhere people have used game elements to get people to do things.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo it's at first a very simple, very obvious question
p30
aVI would like to give you:
p31
aVWhat are your intentions if you are designing something?
p32
aVAnd obviously, intentions are not the only thing,
p33
aVso here is another example for one of these applications.
p34
aVThere are a couple of these kinds of Eco dashboards right now \u2014
p35
aVdashboards built into cars \u2014
p36
aVwhich try to motivate you to drive more fuel-efficiently.
p37
aVThis here is Nissan's MyLeaf,
p38
aVwhere your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior
p39
aVof other people,
p40
aVso you can compete for who drives a route the most fuel-efficiently.
p41
aVAnd these things are very effective, it turns out \u2014
p42
aVso effective that they motivate people to engage in unsafe driving behaviors,
p43
aVlike not stopping at a red light,
p44
aVbecause that way you have to stop and restart the engine,
p45
aVand that would use quite some fuel, wouldn't it?
p46
aVSo despite this being a very well-intended application,
p47
aVobviously there was a side effect of that.
p48
aa(lp49
VHere's another example for one of these side effects.
p50
aVCommendable: a site that allows parents to give their kids little badges
p51
aVfor doing the things that parents want their kids to do,
p52
aVlike tying their shoes.
p53
aVAnd at first that sounds very nice,
p54
aVvery benign, well-intended.
p55
aVBut it turns out, if you look into research on people's mindset,
p56
aVcaring about outcomes,
p57
aVcaring about public recognition,
p58
aVcaring about these kinds of public tokens of recognition
p59
aVis not necessarily very helpful
p60
aVfor your long-term psychological well-being.
p61
aVIt's better if you care about learning something.
p62
aVIt's better when you care about yourself
p63
aVthan how you appear in front of other people.
p64
aVSo that kind of motivational tool that is used actually, in and of itself,
p65
aVhas a long-term side effect,
p66
aVin that every time we use a technology
p67
aVthat uses something like public recognition or status,
p68
aVwe're actually positively endorsing this
p69
aVas a good and normal thing to care about \u2014
p70
aVthat way, possibly having a detrimental effect
p71
aVon the long-term psychological well-being of ourselves as a culture.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo that's a second, very obvious question:
p74
aVWhat are the effects of what you're doing \u2014
p75
aVthe effects you're having with the device, like less fuel,
p76
aVas well as the effects of the actual tools you're using
p77
aVto get people to do things \u2014
p78
aVpublic recognition?
p79
aa(lp80
VNow is that all \u2014 intention, effect?
p81
aVWell, there are some technologies which obviously combine both.
p82
aVBoth good long-term and short-term effects
p83
aVand a positive intention like Fred Stutzman's "Freedom,"
p84
aVwhere the whole point of that application is \u2014
p85
aVwell, we're usually so bombarded with constant requests by other people,
p86
aVwith this device,
p87
aVyou can shut off the Internet connectivity of your PC of choice
p88
aVfor a pre-set amount of time,
p89
aVto actually get some work done.
p90
aVAnd I think most of us will agree that's something well-intended,
p91
aVand also has good consequences.
p92
aVIn the words of Michel Foucault,
p93
aVit is a "technology of the self."
p94
aVIt is a technology that empowers the individual
p95
aVto determine its own life course,
p96
aVto shape itself.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut the problem is, as Foucault points out,
p99
aVthat every technology of the self
p100
aVhas a technology of domination as its flip side.
p101
aVAs you see in today's modern liberal democracies,
p102
aVthe society, the state, not only allows us to determine our self,
p103
aVto shape our self,
p104
aVit also demands it of us.
p105
aVIt demands that we optimize ourselves,
p106
aVthat we control ourselves,
p107
aVthat we self-manage continuously,
p108
aVbecause that's the only way in which such a liberal society works.
p109
aVThese technologies want us to stay in the game
p110
aVthat society has devised for us.
p111
aVThey want us to fit in even better.
p112
aVThey want us to optimize ourselves to fit in.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, I don't say that is necessarily a bad thing;
p115
aVI just think that this example points us to a general realization,
p116
aVand that is: no matter what technology or design you look at,
p117
aVeven something we consider as well-intended
p118
aVand as good in its effects as Stutzman's Freedom,
p119
aVcomes with certain values embedded in it.
p120
aVAnd we can question these values.
p121
aVWe can question: Is it a good thing
p122
aVthat all of us continuously self-optimize ourselves
p123
aVto fit better into that society?
p124
aa(lp125
VOr to give you another example:
p126
aVWhat about a piece of persuasive technology
p127
aVthat convinces Muslim women to wear their headscarves?
p128
aVIs that a good or a bad technology
p129
aVin its intentions or in its effects?
p130
aVWell, that basically depends on the kind of values you bring to bear
p131
aVto make these kinds of judgments.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo that's a third question:
p134
aVWhat values do you use to judge?
p135
aVAnd speaking of values:
p136
aVI've noticed that in the discussion about moral persuasion online
p137
aVand when I'm talking with people,
p138
aVmore often than not, there is a weird bias.
p139
aVAnd that bias is that we're asking:
p140
aVIs this or that "still" ethical?
p141
aVIs it "still" permissible?
p142
aVWe're asking things like:
p143
aVIs this Oxfam donation form,
p144
aVwhere the regular monthly donation is the preset default,
p145
aVand people, maybe without intending it,
p146
aVare encouraged or nudged into giving a regular donation
p147
aVinstead of a one-time donation,
p148
aVis that "still' permissible?
p149
aVIs it "still" ethical?
p150
aVWe're fishing at the low end.
p151
aa(lp152
VBut in fact, that question, "Is it 'still' ethical?"
p153
aVis just one way of looking at ethics.
p154
aVBecause if you look at the beginning of ethics in Western culture,
p155
aVyou see a very different idea of what ethics also could be.
p156
aVFor Aristotle, ethics was not about the question,
p157
aV"Is that still good, or is it bad?"
p158
aVEthics was about the question of how to live life well.
p159
aVAnd he put that in the word "arête,"
p160
aVwhich we, from [Ancient Greek], translate as "virtue."
p161
aVBut really, it means "excellence."
p162
aVIt means living up to your own full potential as a human being.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd that is an idea that, I think,
p165
aVPaul Richard Buchanan put nicely in a recent essay,
p166
aVwhere he said, "Products are vivid arguments
p167
aVabout how we should live our lives."
p168
aVOur designs are not ethical or unethical
p169
aVin that they're using ethical or unethical means of persuading us.
p170
aVThey have a moral component
p171
aVjust in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life
p172
aVthat they present to us.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd if you look into the designed environment around us
p175
aVwith that kind of lens,
p176
aVasking, "What is the vision of the good life
p177
aVthat our products, our design, present to us?",
p178
aVthen you often get the shivers,
p179
aVbecause of how little we expect of each other,
p180
aVof how little we actually seem to expect of our life,
p181
aVand what the good life looks like.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo that's a fourth question I'd like to leave you with:
p184
aVWhat vision of the good life do your designs convey?
p185
aVAnd speaking of design,
p186
aVyou'll notice that I already broadened the discussion,
p187
aVbecause it's not just persuasive technology that we're talking about here,
p188
aVit's any piece of design that we put out here in the world.
p189
aa(lp190
VI don't know whether you know
p191
aVthe great communication researcher Paul Watzlawick who, back in the '60s,
p192
aVmade the argument that we cannot not communicate.
p193
aVEven if we choose to be silent, we chose to be silent,
p194
aVand we're communicating something by choosing to be silent.
p195
aVAnd in the same way that we cannot not communicate,
p196
aVwe cannot not persuade:
p197
aVwhatever we do or refrain from doing,
p198
aVwhatever we put out there as a piece of design, into the world,
p199
aVhas a persuasive component.
p200
aVIt tries to affect people.
p201
aVIt puts a certain vision of the good life out there in front of us,
p202
aa(lp203
Vwhich is what Peter-Paul Verbeek,
p204
aVthe Dutch philosopher of technology, says.
p205
aVNo matter whether we as designers intend it or not,
p206
aVwe materialize morality.
p207
aVWe make certain things harder and easier to do.
p208
aVWe organize the existence of people.
p209
aVWe put a certain vision
p210
aVof what good or bad or normal or usual is
p211
aVin front of people,
p212
aVby everything we put out there in the world.
p213
aa(lp214
VEven something as innocuous as a set of school chairs
p215
aVis a persuasive technology,
p216
aVbecause it presents and materializes a certain vision of the good life \u2014
p217
aVa good life in which teaching and learning and listening
p218
aVis about one person teaching, the others listening;
p219
aVin which it is about learning-is-done-while-sitting;
p220
aVin which you learn for yourself;
p221
aVin which you're not supposed to change these rules,
p222
aVbecause the chairs are fixed to the ground.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd even something as innocuous as a single-design chair,
p225
aVlike this one by Arne Jacobsen,
p226
aVis a persuasive technology,
p227
aVbecause, again, it communicates an idea of the good life:
p228
aVa good life \u2014 a life that you, as a designer, consent to by saying,
p229
aV"In a good life, goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably
p230
aVas this chair.
p231
aVWorkers are treated as well or as badly
p232
aVas the workers were treated that built that chair."
p233
aVThe good life is a life where design is important
p234
aVbecause somebody obviously took the time and spent the money
p235
aVfor that kind of well-designed chair;
p236
aVwhere tradition is important,
p237
aVbecause this is a traditional classic and someone cared about this;
p238
aVand where there is something as conspicuous consumption,
p239
aVwhere it is OK and normal to spend a humongous amount of money
p240
aVon such a chair,
p241
aVto signal to other people what your social status is.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo these are the kinds of layers, the kinds of questions
p244
aVI wanted to lead you through today;
p245
aVthe question of: What are the intentions that you bring to bear
p246
aVwhen you're designing something?
p247
aVWhat are the effects, intended and unintended, that you're having?
p248
aVWhat are the values you're using to judge those?
p249
aVWhat are the virtues, the aspirations
p250
aVthat you're actually expressing in that?
p251
aVAnd how does that apply,
p252
aVnot just to persuasive technology,
p253
aVbut to everything you design?
p254
aa(lp255
VDo we stop there?
p256
aVI don't think so.
p257
aVI think that all of these things are eventually informed
p258
aVby the core of all of this,
p259
aVand this is nothing but life itself.
p260
aVWhy, when the question of what the good life is
p261
aVinforms everything that we design,
p262
aVshould we stop at design and not ask ourselves:
p263
aVHow does it apply to our own life?
p264
aV"Why should the lamp or the house be an art object,
p265
aVbut not our life?"
p266
aVas Michel Foucault puts it.
p267
aa(lp268
VJust to give you a practical example of Buster Benson.
p269
aVThis is Buster setting up a pull-up machine
p270
aVat the office of his new start-up, Habit Labs,
p271
aVwhere they're trying to build other applications like "Health Month"
p272
aVfor people.
p273
aVAnd why is he building a thing like this?
p274
aVWell, here is the set of axioms
p275
aVthat Habit Labs, Buster's start-up, put up for themselves
p276
aVon how they wanted to work together as a team
p277
aVwhen they're building these applications \u2014
p278
aVa set of moral principles they set themselves
p279
aVfor working together \u2014
p280
aVone of them being,
p281
aV"We take care of our own health and manage our own burnout."
p282
aa(lp283
VBecause ultimately, how can you ask yourselves
p284
aVand how can you find an answer on what vision of the good life
p285
aVyou want to convey and create with your designs
p286
aVwithout asking the question:
p287
aVWhat vision of the good life do you yourself want to live?
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd with that,
p290
aVI thank you.

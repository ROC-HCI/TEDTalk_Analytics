VThe career that I started early on in my life
p5
aVwas looking for exotic life forms in exotic places,
p6
aVand at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic,
p7
aVand high deserts and low deserts.
p8
aVUntil about a dozen years ago, when I was really captured by caves,
p9
aVand I really re-focused most of my research in that direction.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo I have a really cool day job\u2014 I get to do some really amazing stuff.
p12
aVI work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet.
p13
aVMany of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them,
p14
aVbut nevertheless, they're absolutely gripping,
p15
aVand contain unbelievable biological wonders
p16
aVthat are very, very different from those that we have on the planet.
p17
aVApart from the intrinsic value
p18
aVof the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there,
p19
aVwe're also using these as templates
p20
aVfor figuring out how to go look
p21
aVfor life on other planets.
p22
aVParticularly Mars, but also Europa,
p23
aVthe small, icy moon around Jupiter.
p24
aVAnd perhaps, someday, far beyond our solar system itself.
p25
aa(lp26
VI'm very passionately interested in the human future,
p27
aVon the Moon and Mars particularly,
p28
aVand elsewhere in the solar system.
p29
aVI think it's time that we transitioned
p30
aVto a solar system-going civilization and species.
p31
aVAnd, as an outgrowth of all of this then,
p32
aVI wonder about whether we can, and whether we even should,
p33
aVthink about transporting Earth-type life to other planets.
p34
aVNotably Mars, as a first example.
p35
aa(lp36
VSomething I never talk about in scientific meetings
p37
aVis how I actually got to this state
p38
aVand why I do the work that I do.
p39
aVWhy don't I have a normal job, a sensible job?
p40
aVAnd then of course, I blame the Soviet Union.
p41
aVBecause in the mid-1950s,
p42
aVwhen I was a tiny child,
p43
aVthey had the audacity to launch
p44
aVa very primitive little satellite called Sputnik,
p45
aVwhich sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.
p46
aVAnd a tremendous amount of money
p47
aVwent into the funding of science
p48
aVand mathematics skills for kids.
p49
aVAnd I'm a product of that generation,
p50
aVlike so many other of my peers.
p51
aVIt really caught hold of us, and caught fire,
p52
aVand it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now.
p53
aa(lp54
VOf course, refusing to grow up \u2014
p55
aV\u2014 even though I impersonate a grown-up in daily life,
p56
aVbut I do a fairly good job of that \u2014
p57
aVbut really retaining that childlike quality
p58
aVof not caring what other people think
p59
aVabout what you're interested in, is really critical.
p60
aVThe next element is the fact that
p61
aVI have applied a value judgment
p62
aVand my value judgment is that the presence of life
p63
aVis better than no life.
p64
aVAnd so, life is more valuable than no life.
p65
aVAnd so I think that that holds together
p66
aVa great deal of the work
p67
aVthat people in this audience approach.
p68
aa(lp69
VI'm very interested in Mars, of course,
p70
aVand that was a product of my being a young undergraduate
p71
aVwhen the Viking Landers landed on Mars.
p72
aVAnd that took what had been
p73
aVa tiny little astronomical object in the sky,
p74
aVthat you would see as a dot,
p75
aVand turned it completely into a landscape,
p76
aVas that very first primitive picture
p77
aVcame rastering across the screen.
p78
aVAnd when it became a landscape,
p79
aVit also became a destination,
p80
aVand altered, really, the course of my life.
p81
aa(lp82
VIn my graduate years I worked with
p83
aVmy colleague and mentor and friend, Steve Schneider,
p84
aVat the National Center for Atmospheric Research,
p85
aVworking on global change issues.
p86
aVWe've written a number of things on
p87
aVthe role of Gaia hypothesis \u2014
p88
aVwhether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity
p89
aVin any meaningful scientific sense,
p90
aVand then, as an outgrowth of that,
p91
aVI worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo, wonderful things and grim things.
p94
aVBut what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet
p95
aVwith external eyes, not just as our home.
p96
aVAnd that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective,
p97
aVto try to then think about the way
p98
aVour planet behaves, as a planet,
p99
aVand with the life that's on it.
p100
aVAnd all of this seems to me to be
p101
aVa salient point in history.
p102
aVWe're getting ready to begin to go
p103
aVthrough the process of leaving our planet of origin
p104
aVand out into the wider solar system and beyond.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo, back to Mars.
p107
aVHow hard is it going to be to find life on Mars?
p108
aVWell, sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other,
p109
aVeven on this planet.
p110
aVSo, finding life on another planet
p111
aVis a non-trivial occupation
p112
aVand we spend a lot of time trying to think about that.
p113
aVWhether or not you think it's likely to be successful
p114
aVsort of depends on what you think about
p115
aVthe chances of life in the universe.
p116
aVI think, myself,
p117
aVthat life is a natural outgrowth
p118
aVof the increasing complexification of matter over time.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo, you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen,
p121
aVand then you get helium, and then you get more complicated stuff,
p122
aVand you get planets forming \u2014
p123
aVand life is a common, planetary-based phenomenon, in my view.
p124
aVCertainly, in the last 15 years,
p125
aVwe've seen increasing numbers of planets
p126
aVoutside of our solar system being confirmed,
p127
aVand just last month, a couple of weeks ago,
p128
aVa planet in the size-class of Earth
p129
aVhas actually been found.
p130
aVAnd so this is very exciting news.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo, my first bold prediction is that,
p133
aVis that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.
p134
aVIt's going to be everywhere we look \u2014
p135
aVwhere there are planetary systems that can possibly support it.
p136
aVAnd those planetary systems are going to be very common.
p137
aVSo, what about life on Mars?
p138
aVWell, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago
p139
aVwhat I thought the chances of life on Mars would be,
p140
aVI would've probably said, a couple of percent.
p141
aVAnd even that was considered outrageous at the time.
p142
aVI was once sneeringly introduced
p143
aVby a former NASA official,
p144
aVas the only person on the planet
p145
aVwho still thought there was life on Mars.
p146
aVOf course, that official is now dead, and I'm not,
p147
aVso there's a certain amount of glory
p148
aVin outliving your adversaries.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut things have changed greatly
p151
aVover the last dozen years.
p152
aVAnd the reason that they have changed
p153
aVis because we now have new information.
p154
aVThe amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '97,
p155
aVand the MER Rover missions
p156
aVthat are on Mars as we speak now
p157
aVand the European Space Agency's Mars Express,
p158
aVhas taught us a number of amazing things.
p159
aVThere is sub-surface ice on that planet.
p160
aVAnd so where there is water,
p161
aVthere is a very high chance of our kind of life.
p162
aVThere's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place \u2013
p163
aVone of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed,
p164
aVand there are these amazing structures called blueberries,
p165
aVwhich are these little, rocky concretions
p166
aVthat we are busy making biologically
p167
aVin my lab right now.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo, with all of these things put together,
p170
aVI think that the chances of life
p171
aVare much greater than I would've ever thought.
p172
aVI think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars, sometime in its past,
p173
aVis maybe one in four to maybe even half and half.
p174
aVSo this is a very bold statement.
p175
aVI think it's there, and I think we need
p176
aVto go look for it, and I think it's underground.
p177
aVSo the game's afoot, and this is the game that we play in astro-biology.
p178
aVHow do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life?
p179
aVHow do you plan to look for it?
p180
aVHow do you know it when you find it?
p181
aVBecause if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it \u2014
p182
aVit would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.
p185
aVVery critically, how do we protect it,
p186
aVif we find it, and not contaminate it?
p187
aVAnd also, even perhaps more critically, because
p188
aVthis is the only home planet we have,
p189
aVhow do we protect us from it, while we study it?
p190
aVSo why might it be hard to find?
p191
aVWell, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy
p192
aVto study microscopic things,
p193
aValthough the amazing tools that we now have to do that
p194
aVallow us to study things in much greater depth,
p195
aVat much smaller scales than ever before.
p196
aVBut it's probably hiding, because if you are out
p197
aVsequestering resources from your environment, that makes you yummy,
p198
aVand other things might want to eat you, or consume you.
p199
aVAnd so, there's a game of predator-prey
p200
aVthat's going to be, essentially, universal, really,
p201
aVin any kind of biological system.
p202
aVIt also may be very, very different in its fundamental properties \u2013
p203
aVits chemistry, or its size.
p204
aa(lp205
VWe say small, but what does that mean?
p206
aVIs it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?
p207
aVIs it bigger than the biggest bacterium? We don't know.
p208
aVAnd speed of activity, which is something that we face
p209
aVin our work with sub-surface organisms,
p210
aVbecause they grow very, very slowly.
p211
aVIf I were to take a swab off your teeth
p212
aVand plate it on a Petri plate,
p213
aVwithin about four or five hours, I would have to see growth.
p214
aVBut the organisms that we work with,
p215
aVfrom the sub-surface of Earth,
p216
aVvery often it's months \u2014 and in many cases, years \u2014
p217
aVbefore we see any growth whatsoever.
p218
aVSo they are, intrinsically, a slower life-form.
p219
aa(lp220
VBut the real issue is that we are guided by
p221
aVour limited experience,
p222
aVand until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know,
p223
aVthen we can't recognize what to look for,
p224
aVor how to plan for it.
p225
aVSo, perspective is everything
p226
aVand, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about,
p227
aVI have learned to think about Earth
p228
aVas an extraterrestrial planet.
p229
aVAnd this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things.
p230
aa(lp231
VThis is my favorite game on airplanes:
p232
aVwhere you're in an airplane and you look out the window,
p233
aVyou see the horizon.
p234
aVI always turn my head on the side,
p235
aVand that simple change makes me go from
p236
aVseeing this planet as home,
p237
aVto seeing it as a planet.
p238
aVIt's a very simple trick, and I never fail to do it
p239
aVwhen I'm sitting in a window seat.
p240
aVWell, this is what we apply to our work.
p241
aVThis shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in.
p242
aVThis is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco, in Mexico,
p243
aVand this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid.
p244
aVThere is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide
p245
aVcoming into this cave from volcanic sources
p246
aVand from the breakdown of evaporite \u2014
p247
aVminerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed \u2014
p248
aVand it is a completely hostile environment for us.
p249
aVWe have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear,
p250
aVand 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you.
p251
aVThis is regularly several hundred parts per million.
p252
aVSo, it's a very hazardous environment,
p253
aVwith CO as well, and many other gases.
p254
aVThese extreme physical and chemical parameters
p255
aVmake the biology that grows in these places very special.
p256
aVBecause contrary to what you might think, this is not devoid of life.
p257
aa(lp258
VThis is one of the richest caves
p259
aVthat we have found on the planet, anywhere.
p260
aVIt's bursting with life.
p261
aVThe extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right,
p262
aVbut one of the reasons that we're interested in them
p263
aVis because they represent, really,
p264
aVthe average conditions that we may expect on other planets.
p265
aVSo, this is part of the ability that we have,
p266
aVto try to stretch our imagination,
p267
aVin terms of what we may find in the future.
p268
aVThere's so much life in this cave,
p269
aVand I can't even begin
p270
aVto scratch the surface of it with you.
p271
aa(lp272
VBut one of the most famous objects out of this
p273
aVare what we call Snottites, for obvious reasons.
p274
aVThis stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old's nose when he has a cold.
p275
aVAnd this is produced by bacteria who are actually
p276
aVmaking more sulfuric acid,
p277
aVand living at pHs right around zero.
p278
aVAnd so, this stuff is like battery acid.
p279
aVAnd yet, everything in this cave has adapted to it.
p280
aVIn fact, there's so much energy available
p281
aVfor biology in this cave,
p282
aVthat there's actually a huge number of cavefish.
p283
aVAnd the local Zoque Indians
p284
aVharvest this twice a year,
p285
aVas part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration.
p286
aa(lp287
VThis is very unusual for caves.
p288
aVIn some of the other amazing caves that we work in \u2014
p289
aVthis is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad,
p290
aVand this is one of the most famous caves in the world.
p291
aVIt's 115 miles of mapped passage,
p292
aVit's pristine, it has no natural opening
p293
aVand it's a gigantic biological,
p294
aVgeo-microbiological laboratory.
p295
aVIn this cave, great areas are covered by
p296
aVthis reddish material that you see here,
p297
aVand also these enormous crystals
p298
aVof selenite that you can see dangling down.
p299
aVThis stuff is produced biologically.
p300
aVThis is the breakdown product of the bedrock,
p301
aVthat organisms are busy munching their way through.
p302
aVThey take iron and manganese minerals
p303
aVwithin the bedrock and they oxidize them.
p304
aVAnd every time they do that, they get a tiny little packet of energy.
p305
aVAnd that tiny little packet of energy is what they use, then,
p306
aVto run their life processes.
p307
aVInterestingly enough, they also do this
p308
aVwith uranium and chromium, and various other toxic metals.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd so, the obvious avenue
p311
aVfor bio-remediation
p312
aVcomes from organisms like this.
p313
aVThese organisms we now bring into the lab,
p314
aVand you can see some of them growing on Petri plates,
p315
aVand get them to reproduce the precise biominerals
p316
aVthat we find on the walls of these caves.
p317
aVSo, these are signals that they leave in the rock record.
p318
aVWell, even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves,
p319
aVwhich are a by-product of volcanic activity,
p320
aVwe find these walls totally covered,
p321
aVin many cases,
p322
aVby these beautiful, glistening silver walls,
p323
aVor shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold.
p324
aVAnd these are mineral deposits
p325
aVthat are also made by bacteria.
p326
aVAnd you can see in these central images here,
p327
aVscanning electron micrographs of some of these guys \u2014
p328
aVthese are gardens of these bacteria.
p329
aa(lp330
VOne of the interesting things about these particular guys
p331
aVis that they're in the actinomycete
p332
aVand streptomycete groups of the bacteria,
p333
aVwhich is where we get most of our antibiotics.
p334
aVThe sub-surface of Earth
p335
aVcontains a vast biodiversity.
p336
aVAnd these organisms,
p337
aVbecause they're very separate from the surface,
p338
aVmake a vast array of novel compounds.
p339
aVAnd so, the potential for exploiting this
p340
aVfor pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses
p341
aVis completely untapped,
p342
aVbut probably exceeds most of the rest
p343
aVof the biodiversity of the planet.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo, lava-tube caves\u2014
p346
aVI've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet.
p347
aVWe know that on Mars and the Moon
p348
aVthere are tons of these structures.
p349
aVWe can see them.
p350
aVOn the left you can see a lava tube forming
p351
aVat a recent eruption \u2014 Mount Etna in Sicily \u2014
p352
aVand this is the way these tubes form.
p353
aVAnd when they hollow out,
p354
aVthen they become habitats for organisms.
p355
aVThese are all over the planet Mars,
p356
aVand we're busy cataloguing them now.
p357
aVAnd so, there's very interesting cave real estate
p358
aVon Mars, at least of that type.
p359
aa(lp360
VIn order to access
p361
aVthese sub-surface environments that we're interested in,
p362
aVwe're very interested in developing the tools to do this.
p363
aVYou know, it's not easy to get into these caves.
p364
aVIt requires crawling, climbing,
p365
aVrope-work, technical rope-work
p366
aVand many other complex human motions
p367
aVin order to access these.
p368
aVWe face the problem of, how can we do this robotically?
p369
aVWhy would we want to do it robotically?
p370
aVWell, we're going to be sending
p371
aVrobotic missions to Mars
p372
aVlong in advance of human missions.
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd then, secondly, getting back to that earlier point that I made
p375
aVabout the preciousness of any life that we may find
p376
aVon Mars, we don't want to contaminate it.
p377
aVAnd one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it
p378
aVis to have an intermediary.
p379
aVAnd in this case, we're imagining
p380
aVintermediary robotic devices
p381
aVthat can actually do some of that
p382
aVfront-end work for us,
p383
aVto protect any potential life that we find.
p384
aVI'm not going to go through all of these projects now,
p385
aVbut we're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects,
p386
aVin collaboration with a number of different groups.
p387
aVI want to talk specifically about the
p388
aVarray that you see on the top.
p389
aa(lp390
VThese are hopping microbot swarms.
p391
aVI'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory
p392
aVand my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT,
p393
aVand we have come up with the idea
p394
aVof having little, jumping bean-like
p395
aVrobots
p396
aVthat are propelled by artificial muscle,
p397
aVwhich is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties \u2014
p398
aVare the EPAMs, or artificial muscles.
p399
aVAnd these allow them to hop.
p400
aVThey behave with
p401
aVa swarm behavior,
p402
aVwhere they relate to each other,
p403
aVmodeled after insect swarm behavior,
p404
aVand they could be made very numerous.
p405
aVAnd so, one can send a thousand of them,
p406
aVas you can see in this upper left-hand picture,
p407
aVa thousand of them could fit into the payload bay
p408
aVthat was used for one of the current MER Rovers.
p409
aVAnd these little guys \u2014 you could lose many of them.
p410
aVIf you send a thousand of them,
p411
aVyou could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission.
p412
aVAnd so, that allows you the flexibility
p413
aVto go into very challenging terrain
p414
aVand actually make your way where you want to go.
p415
aa(lp416
VNow, to wrap this up, I want to talk for two seconds
p417
aVabout caves and the human expansion beyond Earth
p418
aVas a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves.
p419
aVIt occurred to us a number of years ago
p420
aVthat caves have many properties
p421
aVthat people have used
p422
aVand other organisms have used as habitat in the past.
p423
aVAnd perhaps it's time we started to explore those,
p424
aVin the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration.
p425
aa(lp426
VSo, we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study,
p427
aVlooking at the irreducible set of technologies
p428
aVthat you would need in order to
p429
aVactually allow people to inhabit lava tubes
p430
aVon the Moon or Mars.
p431
aVIt turns out to be a fairly simple and small list,
p432
aVand we have gone
p433
aVin the relatively primitive technology direction.
p434
aVSo, we're talking about things like inflatable liners
p435
aVthat can conform to the complex topological shape
p436
aVon the inside of a cave,
p437
aVfoamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology,
p438
aVvarious ways of getting breathing gases
p439
aVmade from the intrinsic materials of these bodies.
p440
aVAnd the future is there for us
p441
aVto use these lava-tube caves on Mars.
p442
aVAnd right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation,
p443
aVbut I think in the future we'll be using them
p444
aVfor habitat and science on these other bodies.
p445
aa(lp446
VNow, my view of what the current status

aVof potential life on Mars is
p448
aVthat it's probably been on the planet,
p449
aVmaybe one in two chances.
p450
aVThe question as to whether
p451
aVthere is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth
p452
aVhas now been very muddied,
p453
aVbecause we now know,
p454
aVfrom Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth,
p455
aVthat there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets.
p456
aa(lp457
VOne of the burning questions, of course, is
p458
aVif we go there and find life in the sub-surface,
p459
aVas I fully expect that we will,
p460
aVis that a second genesis of life?
p461
aVDid life start here
p462
aVand was it transported there?
p463
aVDid it start there and get transported here?
p464
aVThis will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century,
p465
aVand where I expect that we will
p466
aVhave more and more Mars missions to answer these questions.
p467
aVThank you.

VSo I am a surgeon who studies creativity,
p5
aVand I have never had a patient tell me,
p6
aV"I really want you to be creative during surgery,"
p7
aVand so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it.
p8
aVI will say though that, after having done surgery a lot,
p9
aVit's similar to playing a musical instrument.
p10
aVAnd for me, this deep and enduring fascination with sound
p11
aVis what led me to both be a surgeon
p12
aVand to study the science of sound, particularly music.
p13
aVI'm going to talk over the next few minutes
p14
aVabout my career
p15
aVin terms of how I'm able to study music
p16
aVand try to grapple with all these questions
p17
aVof how the brain is able to be creative.
p18
aVI've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University,
p19
aVand at the National Institute of Health where I was previously.
p20
aVI'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments.
p21
aa(lp22
VI will start off by playing a video for you.
p23
aVThis video is of Keith Jarrett, who's a well-known jazz improviser
p24
aVand probably the most well-known, iconic example
p25
aVof someone who takes improvisation to a higher level.
p26
aVAnd he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head,
p27
aVand he'll never play it exactly the same way again,
p28
aVso as a form of intense creativity,
p29
aVI think this is a great example.
p30
aVAnd so why don't we go and click the video.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Music)
p33
aa(lp34
V(Music ends)
p35
aa(lp36
VIt's really a remarkable thing that happens there.
p37
aVI've always as a listener, as a fan,
p38
aVI listen to that, and I'm astounded.
p39
aVI think \u2014 how can this possibly be?
p40
aVHow can the brain generate that much information,
p41
aVthat much music, spontaneously?
p42
aVAnd so I set out with this concept, scientifically,
p43
aVthat artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic,
p44
aVmeaning that it's a product of the brain.
p45
aVThere's not too many brain-dead people creating art.
p46
aVWith this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product,
p47
aVI took this thesis that we could study it
p48
aVjust like we study any other complex neurologic process,
p49
aVand there are subquestions that I put there.
p50
aVIs it possible to study creativity scientifically?
p51
aVAnd I think that's a good question.
p52
aVAnd I'll tell you that most scientific studies of music,
p53
aVthey're very dense,
p54
aVand when you go through them,
p55
aVit's very hard to recognize the music in it.
p56
aVIn fact, they seem to be unmusical entirely
p57
aVand to miss the point of the music.
p58
aa(lp59
VThis brings the second question:
p60
aVWhy should scientists study creativity?
p61
aVMaybe we're not the right people to do it.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VWell it may be, but I will say that, from a scientific perspective,
p66
aVwe talked a lot about innovation today,
p67
aVthe science of innovation,
p68
aVhow much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate
p69
aVis in its infancy,
p70
aVand truly, we know very little about how we are able to be creative.
p71
aVI think that we're going to see,
p72
aVover the next 10, 20, 30 years,
p73
aVa real science of creativity that's burgeoning
p74
aVand is going to flourish,
p75
aVBecause we now have new methods that can enable us
p76
aVto take this process like complex jazz improvisation,
p77
aVand study it rigorously.
p78
aVSo it gets down to the brain.
p79
aVAll of us have this remarkable brain,
p80
aVwhich is poorly understood, to say the least.
p81
aVI think that neuroscientists have more questions than answers,
p82
aVand I'm not going to give you answers today,
p83
aVjust ask a lot of questions.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd that's what I do in my lab.
p86
aVI ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this.
p87
aVThis is the main method that I use. This is functional MRI.
p88
aVIf you've been in an MRI scanner, it's very much the same,
p89
aVbut this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain,
p90
aVbut to also take pictures of active areas of the brain.
p91
aVThe way that's done is by the following:
p92
aVThere's something called BOLD imaging,
p93
aVwhich is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging.
p94
aVWhen you're in an fMRI scanner, you're in a big magnet
p95
aVthat's aligning your molecules in certain areas.
p96
aVWhen an area of the brain is active, meaning a neural area is active,
p97
aVit gets blood flow shunted to that area.
p98
aVThat blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area
p99
aVwith a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration.
p100
aVDeoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI,
p101
aVwhereas oxyhemoglobin can't.
p102
aVSo through this method of inference \u2014
p103
aVand we're measuring blood flow, not neural activity \u2014
p104
aVwe say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood
p105
aVwas active during a particular task, and that's the crux of how fMRI works.
p106
aVAnd it's been used since the '90s to study really complex processes.
p107
aa(lp108
VI'm going to review a study that I did, which was jazz in an fMRI scanner.
p109
aVIt was done with a colleague, Alan Braun, at the NIH.
p110
aVThis is a short video of how we did this project.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard
p113
aVthat we use for the jazz experiments.
p114
aVAnd it's a 35-key keyboard
p115
aVdesigned to fit both inside the scanner,
p116
aVbe magnetically safe,
p117
aVhave minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact,
p118
aVand have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs
p119
aVwhile they're lying down in the scanner, playing on their back.
p120
aVIt works like this \u2014 this doesn't actually produce any sound.
p121
aVIt sends out what's called a MIDI signal \u2014
p122
aVor a Musical Instrument Digital Interface \u2014
p123
aVthrough these wires into the box and then the computer,
p124
aVwhich then trigger high-quality piano samples like this.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Music)
p127
aa(lp128
V(Music)
p129
aa(lp130
V(Music ends)
p131
aa(lp132
VOK, so it works.
p133
aVAnd so through this piano keyboard,
p134
aVwe have the means to take a musical process and study it.
p135
aVSo what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard?
p136
aVYou can't just say, "It's great we have a keyboard."
p137
aVWe have to come up with a scientific experiment.
p138
aVThe experiment really rests on the following:
p139
aVWhat happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over-learned,
p140
aVand what happens in the brain during something
p141
aVthat is spontaneously generated, or improvised,
p142
aVin a way that's matched motorically
p143
aVand in terms of lower-level sensory motor features?
p144
aa(lp145
VI have here what we call the paradigms.
p146
aVThere's a scale paradigm, which is playing a scale up and down, memorized,
p147
aVthen there's improvising on a scale,
p148
aVquarter notes, metronome, right hand \u2014
p149
aVscientifically very safe,
p150
aVbut musically really boring.
p151
aVThen there's the bottom one, which is called the jazz paradigm.
p152
aVSo we brought professional jazz players to the NIH,
p153
aVand we had them memorize this piece of music on the lower-left,
p154
aVwhich is what you heard me playing \u2014
p155
aVand we had them improvise to the same chord changes.
p156
aVAnd if you can hit that lower-right sound icon,
p157
aVthat's an example of what was recorded in the scanner.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Music)
p160
aa(lp161
V(Music ends)
p162
aa(lp163
VIn the end, it's not the most natural environment,
p164
aVbut they're able to play real music.
p165
aVAnd I've listened to that solo 200 times,
p166
aVand I still like it.
p167
aVAnd the musicians were comfortable in the end.
p168
aVWe first measured the number of notes.
p169
aVWere they playing more notes when they were improvising?
p170
aVThat was not what was going on.
p171
aVAnd then we looked at the brain activity.
p172
aVI will try to condense this for you.
p173
aVThese are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes
p174
aVwhen you're improvising vs. when you're doing something memorized.
p175
aVIn red is an area that's active in the prefrontal cortex,
p176
aVthe frontal lobe of the brain,
p177
aVand in blue is this area that was deactivated.
p178
aVSo we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex
p179
aVthat went way up in activity.
p180
aVWe had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex
p181
aVthat went way down in activity,
p182
aVI'll summarize that for you.
p183
aa(lp184
VThese are multifunctional areas of the brain,
p185
aVthese are not the jazz areas of the brain.
p186
aVThey do a whole host of things
p187
aVthat have to do with self-reflection,
p188
aVintrospection, working memory etc.
p189
aVReally, consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe.
p190
aVBut we have this combination
p191
aVof an area that's thought to be involved in self-monitoring, turning off,
p192
aVand this area that's thought to be autobiographical,
p193
aVor self-expressive, turning on.
p194
aVWe think, at least in this preliminary \u2014
p195
aVit's one study; it's probably wrong, but it's one study \u2014
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
Vwe think that at least a reasonable hypothesis
p200
aVis that, to be creative,
p201
aVyou should have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe.
p202
aVOne area turns on, and a big area shuts off,
p203
aVso that you're not inhibited, you're willing to make mistakes,
p204
aVso that you're not constantly shutting down
p205
aVall of these new generative impulses.
p206
aVNow a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity \u2014
p207
aVsometimes it's done communicatively.
p208
aa(lp209
VThe next question was:
p210
aVWhat happens when musicians are trading back and forth,
p211
aVsomething called "trading fours,"
p212
aVwhich is something they do normally in a jazz experiment.
p213
aVSo this is a 12-bar blues,
p214
aVand I've broken it down into four-bar groups,
p215
aVso you would know how you would trade.
p216
aVWe brought a musician into the scanner, same way,
p217
aVhad them memorize this melody
p218
aVthen had another musician out in the control room
p219
aVtrading back and forth interactively.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo this is a musician, Mike Pope,
p222
aVone of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Music)
p225
aa(lp226
VHe's now playing the piece that we just saw
p227
aVa little better than I wrote it.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.
p230
aa(lp231
VMike Pope: May the force be with you.
p232
aa(lp233
VNurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?
p234
aa(lp235
VMP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.
p236
aa(lp237
VCL: You have to have the right attitude to agree to do it.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VIt's kind of fun, actually.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Music)
p244
aa(lp245
VNow we're playing back and forth.
p246
aVHe's in there. You can see his legs up there.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Music)
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd then I'm in the control room here, playing back and forth.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Music)
p253
aa(lp254
V(Music ends)
p255
aa(lp256
V(Video) Mike Pope: This is a pretty good representation
p257
aVof what it's like.
p258
aVAnd it's good that it's not too quick.
p259
aVThe fact that we do it over and over again
p260
aVlets you acclimate to your surroundings.
p261
aVSo the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing,
p262
aVlooking at my hands through two mirrors,
p263
aVlaying on my back,
p264
aVand not able to move at all except for my hand.
p265
aVThat was challenging.
p266
aVBut again \u2014
p267
aVthere were moments, for sure \u2014
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
Vthere were moments of real, honest-to-God musical interplay, for sure.
p272
aa(lp273
VCL: At this point, I'll take a few moments.
p274
aVSo what you're seeing here \u2014
p275
aVand I'm doing a cardinal sin in science,
p276
aVwhich is to show you preliminary data.
p277
aVThis is one subject's data.
p278
aVThis is, in fact, Mike Pope's data.
p279
aVSo what am I showing you here?
p280
aVWhen he was trading fours with me, improvising vs. memorized,
p281
aVhis language areas lit up, his Broca's area,
p282
aVin the inferior frontal gyrus on the left.
p283
aVHe had it also homologous on the right.
p284
aVThis is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication.
p285
aVThis whole notion that music is a language \u2014
p286
aVmaybe there's a neurologic basis to it after all,
p287
aVand we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation.
p288
aVSo we've done this on eight subjects now,
p289
aVand we're getting all the data together,
p290
aVhopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow when I think about improvisation and the language, what's next?
p293
aVRap, of course, rap \u2014 freestyle.
p294
aVI've always been fascinated by freestyle.
p295
aVAnd let's play this video.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be, standing five-ten I be
p298
aVRockin' it when I be, in your vicinity
p299
aVWhole-style synergy, recognize symmetry
p300
aVGo and try to injure me, broke 'em down chemically
p301
aVAin't the number 10 MC, talk about how been I be
p302
aVStyled it like Kennedy, late like a 10 to three
p303
aVWhen I say when I be, girls say bend that key cut
p304
aa(lp305
VCL: So there's a lot of analogy
p306
aVbetween what takes place in freestyle rap and jazz.
p307
aVThere are a lot of correlates between the two forms of music,
p308
aVI think, in different time periods, in lot of ways,
p309
aVrap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve.
p310
aVSo how do you study rap scientifically?
p311
aVAnd my colleagues think I'm crazy, but I think it's very viable.
p312
aVThis is what you do:
p313
aVYou have a freestyle artist come and memorize a rap
p314
aVthat you write for them,
p315
aVthat they've never heard before, and then you have them freestyle.
p316
aVSo I told my lab members that I would rap for TED,
p317
aVand they said, "No, you won't."
p318
aVAnd then I thought \u2014
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
V(Applause)
p323
aa(lp324
VBut here's the thing.
p325
aVWith this big screen, you can all rap with me. OK?
p326
aVSo what we had them do
p327
aVwas memorize this lower-left sound icon, please.
p328
aVThis is the control condition. This is what they memorized.
p329
aa(lp330
VComputer: Memory, thump.
p331
aa(lp332
VCL: Thump of the beat in a known repeat

VCL: I search for the truth in this eternal quest
p340
aVMy passion's not fashion, you can see how I'm dressed
p341
aVPsychopathic words in my head appear
p342
aVWhisper these lyrics only I can hear
p343
aa(lp344
VComputer: Art.
p345
aa(lp346
VCL: The art of discovering and that which is hovering
p347
aVInside the mind of those unconfined
p348
aVAll of these words keep pouring out like rain
p349
aVI need a mad scientist to check my brain
p350
aa(lp351
VComputer: Stop.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Applause)
p354
aa(lp355
VI guarantee you that will never happen again.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VSo now, what's great about these free-stylers,
p360
aVthey will get cued different words.
p361
aVThey don't know what's coming,
p362
aVbut they'll hear something off the cuff.
p363
aVGo hit that right sound icon,
p364
aVthere will be cued three square words: like, not and head.

p388
aVIt's doing something neurologically remarkable.
p389
aVWhether or not you like the music is irrelevant.
p390
aVCreatively speaking, it's just a phenomenal thing.

p414
aa(lp415
VCL: I'm going to stop that there; so what do we see in his brain?
p416
aVThis is four rappers' brains.
p417
aVAnd we do see language areas lighting up,
p418
aVbut then, eyes closed \u2014
p419
aVwhen you are freestyling vs. memorizing,
p420
aVyou've got major visual areas lighting up.
p421
aVYou've got major cerebellar activity, which is involved in motor coordination.
p422
aVYou have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task,
p423
aVwhen that one task is creative and the other task is memorized.
p424
aVIt's very preliminary, but I think it's kind of cool.
p425
aa(lp426
VTo conclude, we've got a lot of questions to ask,
p427
aVand like I said, we'll ask questions here, not answer them.
p428
aVBut we want to get at the root of what is creative genius neurologically,
p429
aVand I think, with these methods, we're getting close.
p430
aVAnd I think, hopefully in the next 10, 20 years,
p431
aVyou'll see real, meaningful studies
p432
aVthat say science has to catch up to art,
p433
aVand maybe we're starting now to get there.
p434
aa(lp435
VThank you for your time, I appreciate it.

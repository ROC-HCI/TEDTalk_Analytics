VI'd like to start, if I may,
p5
aVwith the story of the Paisley snail.
p6
aVOn the evening of the 26th of August, 1928,
p7
aVMay Donoghue took a train from Glasgow
p8
aVto the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city,
p9
aVand there at the Wellmeadow Café,
p10
aVshe had a Scots ice cream float,
p11
aVa mix of ice cream and ginger beer
p12
aVbought for her by a friend.
p13
aVThe ginger beer came in a brown, opaque bottle
p14
aVlabeled "D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley."
p15
aVShe drank some of the ice cream float,
p16
aVbut as the remaining ginger beer was poured
p17
aVinto her tumbler,
p18
aVa decomposed snail
p19
aVfloated to the surface of her glass.
p20
aVThree days later, she was admitted
p21
aVto the Glasgow Royal Infirmary
p22
aVand diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis
p23
aVand shock.
p24
aa(lp25
VThe case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed
p26
aVset a very important legal precedent:
p27
aVStevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer,
p28
aVwas held to have a clear duty of care
p29
aVtowards May Donoghue,
p30
aVeven though there was no contract between them,
p31
aVand, indeed, she hadn't even bought the drink.
p32
aVOne of the judges, Lord Atkin, described it like this:
p33
aVYou must take care to avoid acts or omissions
p34
aVwhich you can reasonably foresee
p35
aVwould be likely to injure your neighbor.
p36
aVIndeed, one wonders that without a duty of care,
p37
aVhow many people would have had to suffer
p38
aVfrom gastroenteritis before Stevenson eventually went out of business.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow please hang on to that Paisley snail story,
p41
aVbecause it's an important principle.
p42
aVLast year, the Hansard Society, a nonpartisan charity
p43
aVwhich seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy
p44
aVand encourage greater public involvement in politics
p45
aVpublished, alongside their annual audit
p46
aVof political engagement, an additional section
p47
aVdevoted entirely to politics and the media.
p48
aVHere are a couple of rather depressing observations
p49
aVfrom that survey.
p50
aVTabloid newspapers do not appear
p51
aVto advance the political citizenship of their readers,
p52
aVrelative even to those
p53
aVwho read no newspapers whatsoever.
p54
aVTabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agree
p55
aVwith a negative view of politics
p56
aVthan readers of no newspapers.
p57
aVThey're not just less politically engaged.
p58
aVThey are consuming media that reinforces
p59
aVtheir negative evaluation of politics,
p60
aVthereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical
p61
aVattitude to democracy and their own role within it.
p62
aVLittle wonder that the report concluded that
p63
aVin this respect, the press, particularly the tabloids,
p64
aVappear not to be living up to the importance
p65
aVof their role in our democracy.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously
p68
aVchallenge that view.
p69
aVBut if Hansard are right, and they usually are,
p70
aVthen we've got a very serious problem on our hands,
p71
aVand it's one that I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes
p72
aVfocusing upon.
p73
aa(lp74
VSince the Paisley snail,
p75
aVand especially over the past decade or so,
p76
aVa great deal of thinking has been developed
p77
aVaround the notion of a duty of care
p78
aVas it relates to a number of aspects of civil society.
p79
aVGenerally a duty of care arises when one individual
p80
aVor a group of individuals undertakes an activity
p81
aVwhich has the potential to cause harm to another,
p82
aVeither physically, mentally or economically.
p83
aVThis is principally focused on obvious areas,
p84
aVsuch as our empathetic response to children and young people,
p85
aVto our service personnel, and to the elderly and infirm.
p86
aVIt is seldom, if ever, extended to equally important arguments
p87
aVaround the fragility of our present system of government,
p88
aVto the notion that honesty, accuracy and impartiality
p89
aVare fundamental to the process of building
p90
aVand embedding an informed,
p91
aVparticipatory democracy.
p92
aVAnd the more you think about it,
p93
aVthe stranger that is.
p94
aa(lp95
VA couple of years ago, I had the pleasure
p96
aVof opening a brand new school
p97
aVin the northeast of England.
p98
aVIt had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360.
p99
aVAs I walked through their impressive,
p100
aVglass-covered atrium,
p101
aVin front of me, emblazoned on the wall
p102
aVin letters of fire
p103
aVwas Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction:
p104
aVIf it's not true, don't say it;
p105
aVif it's not right, don't do it.
p106
aVThe head teacher saw me staring at it,
p107
aVand he said, "Oh, that's our school motto."
p108
aVOn the train back to London,
p109
aVI couldn't get it out of my mind.
p110
aVI kept thinking, can it really have taken us
p111
aVover 2,000 years to come to terms
p112
aVwith that simple notion
p113
aVas being our minimum expectation of each other?
p114
aVIsn't it time that we develop this concept
p115
aVof a duty of care
p116
aVand extended it to include a care
p117
aVfor our shared but increasingly endangered democratic values?
p118
aVAfter all, the absence of a duty of care
p119
aVwithin many professions
p120
aVcan all too easily amount to accusations of negligence,
p121
aVand that being the case, can we be really comfortable with the thought
p122
aVthat we're in effect being negligent
p123
aVin respect of the health of our own societies
p124
aVand the values that necessarily underpin them?
p125
aVCould anyone honestly suggest, on the evidence,
p126
aVthat the same media which Hansard so roundly condemned
p127
aVhave taken sufficient care to avoid behaving
p128
aVin ways which they could reasonably have foreseen
p129
aVwould be likely to undermine or even damage
p130
aVour inherently fragile democratic settlement.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow there will be those who will argue
p133
aVthat this could all too easily drift into a form
p134
aVof censorship, albeit self-censorship,
p135
aVbut I don't buy that argument.
p136
aVIt has to be possible
p137
aVto balance freedom of expression
p138
aVwith wider moral and social responsibilities.
p139
aa(lp140
VLet me explain why by taking the example
p141
aVfrom my own career as a filmmaker.
p142
aVThroughout that career, I never accepted
p143
aVthat a filmmaker should set about putting
p144
aVtheir own work outside or above what he or she
p145
aVbelieved to be a decent set of values
p146
aVfor their own life, their own family,
p147
aVand the future of the society in which we all live.
p148
aVI'd go further.
p149
aVA responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work
p150
aVto a point at which it becomes less than true
p151
aVto the world they themselves wish to inhabit.
p152
aVAs I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers
p153
aVare all required to face up to the social expectations
p154
aVthat come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium
p155
aVwith their well-honed professional skills.
p156
aVObviously this is not a mandated duty,
p157
aVbut for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist
p158
aVor even blogger, it strikes me as being utterly inescapable.
p159
aa(lp160
VWe should always remember that our notion
p161
aVof individual freedom and its partner, creative freedom,
p162
aVis comparatively new
p163
aVin the history of Western ideas,
p164
aVand for that reason, it's often undervalued
p165
aVand can be very quickly undermined.
p166
aVIt's a prize easily lost,
p167
aVand once lost, once surrendered,
p168
aVit can prove very, very hard to reclaim.
p169
aVAnd its first line of defense
p170
aVhas to be our own standards,
p171
aVnot those enforced on us by a censor or legislation,
p172
aVour own standards and our own integrity.
p173
aVOur integrity as we deal with those
p174
aVwith whom we work
p175
aVand our own standards as we operate within society.
p176
aVAnd these standards of ours
p177
aVneed to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda.
p178
aVThey're part of a collective responsibility,
p179
aVthe responsibility of the artist or the journalist
p180
aVto deal with the world as it really is,
p181
aVand this, in turn, must go hand in hand
p182
aVwith the responsibility of those governing society
p183
aVto also face up to that world,
p184
aVand not to be tempted to misappropriate
p185
aVthe causes of its ills.
p186
aVYet, as has become strikingly clear
p187
aVover the last couple of years,
p188
aVsuch responsibility has to a very great extent
p189
aVbeen abrogated by large sections of the media.
p190
aVAnd as a consequence, across the Western world,
p191
aVthe over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest
p192
aVand their appeal to a largely disillusioned,
p193
aVolder demographic,
p194
aValong with the apathy and obsession with the trivial
p195
aVthat typifies at least some of the young,
p196
aVtaken together, these and other similarly
p197
aVcontemporary aberrations
p198
aVare threatening to squeeze the life
p199
aVout of active, informed debate and engagement,
p200
aVand I stress active.
p201
aa(lp202
VThe most ardent of libertarians might argue
p203
aVthat Donoghue v. Stevenson should have been thrown out of court
p204
aVand that Stevenson would eventually have gone out of business
p205
aVif he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it.
p206
aVBut most of us, I think, accept some small role
p207
aVfor the state to enforce a duty of care,
p208
aVand the key word here is reasonable.
p209
aVJudges must ask, did they take reasonable care
p210
aVand could they have reasonably foreseen
p211
aVthe consequences of their actions?
p212
aVFar from signifying overbearing state power,
p213
aVit's that small common sense test of reasonableness
p214
aVthat I'd like us to apply to those in the media
p215
aVwho, after all, set the tone and the content
p216
aVfor much of our democratic discourse.
p217
aa(lp218
VDemocracy, in order to work, requires that
p219
aVreasonable men and women take the time to understand and debate
p220
aVdifficult, sometimes complex issues,
p221
aVand they do so in an atmosphere which strives
p222
aVfor the type of understanding that leads to,
p223
aVif not agreement, then at least a productive
p224
aVand workable compromise.
p225
aVPolitics is about choices,
p226
aVand within those choices, politics is about priorities.
p227
aVIt's about reconciling conflicting preferences
p228
aVwherever and whenever possibly based on fact.
p229
aVBut if the facts themselves are distorted,
p230
aVthe resolutions are likely only to create further conflict,
p231
aVwith all the stresses and strains on society
p232
aVthat inevitably follow.
p233
aVThe media have to decide:
p234
aVDo they see their role as being to inflame
p235
aVor to inform?
p236
aVBecause in the end, it comes down to a combination
p237
aVof trust and leadership.
p238
aa(lp239
VFifty years ago this week, President John F. Kennedy
p240
aVmade two epoch-making speeches,
p241
aVthe first on disarmament and the second on civil rights.
p242
aVThe first led almost immediately
p243
aVto the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,
p244
aVand the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
p245
aVboth of which represented giant leaps forward.
p246
aVDemocracy, well-led and well-informed,
p247
aVcan achieve very great things,
p248
aVbut there's a precondition.
p249
aVWe have to trust that those making those decisions
p250
aVare acting in the best interest not of themselves
p251
aVbut of the whole of the people.
p252
aVWe need factually-based options,
p253
aVclearly laid out,
p254
aVnot those of a few powerful
p255
aVand potentially manipulative corporations
p256
aVpursuing their own frequently narrow agendas,
p257
aVbut accurate, unprejudiced information
p258
aVwith which to make our own judgments.
p259
aVIf we want to provide decent, fulfilling lives
p260
aVfor our children and our children's children,
p261
aVwe need to exercise to the very greatest degree possible
p262
aVthat duty of care for a vibrant,
p263
aVand hopefully a lasting, democracy.
p264
aVThank you very much for listening to me.
p265
aV(Applause)

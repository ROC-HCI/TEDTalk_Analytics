VBoth myself and my brother
p5
aVbelong to the under 30 demographic,
p6
aVwhich Pat said makes 70 percent,
p7
aVbut according to our statistics
p8
aVit makes 60 percent of the region's population.
p9
aVQatar is no exception to the region.
p10
aVIt's a very young nation led by young people.
p11
aVWe have been reminiscing about the latest technologies
p12
aVand the iPods,
p13
aVand for me the abaya,
p14
aVmy traditional dress that I'm wearing today.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow this is not a religious garment,
p17
aVnor is it a religious statement.
p18
aVInstead, it's a diverse cultural statement
p19
aVthat we choose to wear.
p20
aVNow I remember a few years ago,
p21
aVa journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here,
p22
aVpresident of Qatar University \u2014
p23
aVwho, by the way, is a woman \u2014
p24
aVhe asked her whether she thought
p25
aVthe abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way.
p26
aVHer answer was quite the contrary.
p27
aVInstead, she felt more free,
p28
aVmore free because she could wear whatever she wanted
p29
aVunder the abaya.
p30
aVShe could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVNot that you do; I'm just saying.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VMy point is here, people have a choice \u2014
p37
aVjust like the Indian lady could wear her sari
p38
aVor the Japanese woman could wear her kimono.
p39
aVWe are changing our culture from within,
p40
aVbut at the same time
p41
aVwe are reconnecting with our traditions.
p42
aVWe know that modernization is happening.
p43
aVAnd yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation.
p44
aVBut at the same time
p45
aVwe are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage.
p46
aVIt's important for us to grow organically.
p47
aVAnd we continuously make the conscious decision
p48
aVto reach that balance.
p49
aa(lp50
VIn fact, research has shown
p51
aVthat the more the world is flat,
p52
aVif I use Tom Friedman's analogy,
p53
aVor global,
p54
aVthe more and more people are wanting to be different.
p55
aVAnd for us young people,
p56
aVthey're looking to become individuals
p57
aVand find their differences amongst themselves.
p58
aVWhich is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy
p59
aVof globalizing the local
p60
aVand localizing the global.
p61
aVWe don't want to be all the same,
p62
aVbut we want to respect each other and understand each other.
p63
aVAnd therefore tradition becomes more important,
p64
aVnot less important.
p65
aa(lp66
VLife necessitates a universal world,
p67
aVhowever, we believe in the security
p68
aVof having a local identity.
p69
aVAnd this is what the leaders of this region
p70
aVare trying to do.
p71
aVWe're trying to be part of this global village,
p72
aVbut at the same time we're revising ourselves
p73
aVthrough our cultural institutions and cultural development.
p74
aVI'm a representation of that phenomenon.
p75
aVAnd I think a lot of people in this room,
p76
aVI can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself.
p77
aVAnd I'm sure, although we can't see the people in Washington,
p78
aVthey are in the same position.
p79
aVWe're continuously trying to straddle
p80
aVdifferent worlds, different cultures
p81
aVand trying to meet the challenges
p82
aVof a different expectation
p83
aVfrom ourselves and from others.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo I want to ask a question:
p86
aVWhat should culture in the 21st century look like?
p87
aVIn a time where the world is becoming personalized,
p88
aVwhen the mobile phone, the burger, the telephone,
p89
aVeverything has its own personal identity,
p90
aVhow should we perceive ourselves
p91
aVand how should we perceive others?
p92
aVHow does that impact our desert culture?
p93
aa(lp94
VI'm not sure of how many of you in Washington
p95
aVare aware of the cultural developments happening in the region
p96
aVand, the more recent, Museum of Islamic Art
p97
aVopened in Qatar in 2008.
p98
aVI myself am personalizing these cultural developments,
p99
aVbut I also understand
p100
aVthat this has to be done organically.
p101
aVYes, we do have all the resources that we need
p102
aVin order to develop new cultural institutions,
p103
aVbut what I think is more important
p104
aVis that we are very fortunate
p105
aVto have visionary leaders
p106
aVwho understand that this can't happen from outside,
p107
aVit has to come from within.
p108
aVAnd guess what?
p109
aVYou might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf
p110
aVwho are leading these cultural initiatives
p111
aVhappen to be women.
p112
aa(lp113
VI want to ask you, why do you think this is?
p114
aVIs it because it's a soft option;
p115
aVwe have nothing else to do?
p116
aVNo, I don't think so.
p117
aVI think that women in this part of the world
p118
aVrealize that culture is an important component
p119
aVto connect people
p120
aVboth locally and regionally.
p121
aVIt's a natural component
p122
aVfor bringing people together, discussing ideas \u2014
p123
aVin the same way we're doing here at TED.
p124
aVWe're here, we're part of a community,
p125
aVsharing out ideas and discussing them.
p126
aVArt becomes a very important part
p127
aVof our national identity.
p128
aVThe existential and social and political impact
p129
aVan artist has
p130
aVon his nation's development of cultural identity
p131
aVis very important.
p132
aa(lp133
VYou know, art and culture is big business.
p134
aVAsk me.
p135
aVAsk the chairpersons and CEOs
p136
aVof Sotheby's and Christie's.
p137
aVAsk Charles Saatchi about great art.
p138
aVThey make a lot of money.
p139
aVSo I think women in our society
p140
aVare becoming leaders,
p141
aVbecause they realize
p142
aVthat for their future generations,
p143
aVit's very important
p144
aVto maintain our cultural identities.
p145
aVWhy else do Greeks demand the return
p146
aVof the Elgin Marbles?
p147
aVAnd why is there an uproar
p148
aVwhen a private collector tries to sell his collection
p149
aVto a foreign museum?
p150
aVWhy does it take me months on end
p151
aVto get an export license from London or New York
p152
aVin order to get pieces into my country?
p153
aa(lp154
VIn few hours, Shirin Neshat, my friend from Iran
p155
aVwho's a very important artist for us
p156
aVwill be talking to you.
p157
aVShe lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist.
p158
aVInstead, she tries to engage
p159
aVin a very important dialogue
p160
aVabout her culture, nation and heritage.
p161
aVShe does that through important visual forms
p162
aVof photography and film.
p163
aa(lp164
VIn the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums
p165
aVthrough an organic process from within.
p166
aVOur mission is of cultural integration and independence.
p167
aVWe don't want to have what there is in the West.
p168
aVWe don't want their collections.
p169
aVWe want to build our own identities, our own fabric,
p170
aVcreate an open dialogue
p171
aVso that we share our ideas
p172
aVand share yours with us.
p173
aVIn a few days,
p174
aVwe will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art.
p175
aVWe have done extensive research
p176
aVto ensure that Arab and Muslim artists,
p177
aVand Arabs who are not Muslims \u2014
p178
aVnot all Arabs are Muslims, by the way \u2014
p179
aVbut we make sure that they are represented
p180
aVin this new institution.
p181
aVThis institution is government-backed
p182
aVand it has been the case
p183
aVfor the past three decades.
p184
aVWe will open the museum in a few days,
p185
aVand I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways
p186
aVand come and join us.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VNow this museum is just as important to us as the West.
p191
aVSome of you might have heard
p192
aVof the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine,
p193
aVbut I doubt a lot of people know
p194
aVthat this artist worked in Picasso's studio
p195
aVin Paris in the 1930s.
p196
aVFor me it was a new discovery.
p197
aVAnd I think with time, in the years to come
p198
aVwe'll be learning a lot about our Picassos,
p199
aVour Legers and our Cezannes.
p200
aVWe do have artists,
p201
aVbut unfortunately we have not discovered them yet.
p202
aa(lp203
VNow visual expression is just one form
p204
aVof culture integration.
p205
aVWe have realized that recently
p206
aVmore and more people
p207
aVare using the means of YouTube and social networking
p208
aVto express their stories, share their photos
p209
aVand tell their own stories through their own voices.
p210
aVIn a similar way,
p211
aVwe have created the Doha Film Institute.
p212
aVNow the Doha Film Institute is an organization
p213
aVto teach people about film and filmmaking.
p214
aVLast year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker.
p215
aVToday I am proud to say
p216
aVwe have trained and educated
p217
aVover 66 Qatari women filmmakers
p218
aVto edit, tell their own stories
p219
aVin their own voices.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Applause)
p222
aa(lp223
VNow if you'll allow me, I would love to share a one-minute film
p224
aVthat has proven to show
p225
aVthat a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku
p226
aVin telling a big picture.
p227
aVAnd this is one of our filmmakers' products.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Video) Boy: Hey listen! Did you know that the stocks are up?
p230
aVWho are you playing?
p231
aVGirl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf.
p232
aVKhaled: Why would I want to put it on?
p233
aVGirl: Do as you're told, young girl.
p234
aVBoy: No, you play mom and I play dad. (Girl: But it's my game.)
p235
aVPlay by yourself then.
p236
aVGirl: Women! One word and they get upset.
p237
aVUseless.
p238
aVThank you. Thank you!
p239
aa(lp240
V(Applause)
p241
aa(lp242
VSM: Going back to straddling between East and West,
p243
aVlast month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival
p244
aVhere in Doha.
p245
aVThe Doha Tribeca Film Festival
p246
aVwas held at our new cultural hub, Katara.
p247
aVIt attracted 42,000 people,
p248
aVand we showcased 51 films.
p249
aVNow the Doha Tribeca Film Festival
p250
aVis not an imported festival,
p251
aVbut rather an important festival
p252
aVbetween the cities of New York and Doha.
p253
aVIt's important for two things.
p254
aVFirst, it allows us to showcase
p255
aVour Arab filmmakers and voices
p256
aVto one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world,
p257
aVNew York City.
p258
aVAt the same time, we are inviting them
p259
aVto come and explore our part of the world.
p260
aVThey're learning our culture, our language, our heritage
p261
aVand realizing we're just as different
p262
aVand just the same as each other.
p263
aa(lp264
VNow over and over again,
p265
aVpeople have said, "Let's build bridges,"
p266
aVand frankly, I want to do more than that.
p267
aVI would like break the walls of ignorance
p268
aVbetween East and West \u2014
p269
aVno, not the soft option that we have discussed before,
p270
aVbut rather the soft power
p271
aVthat Joseph Nye has spoken about before.
p272
aVCulture's a very important tool to bring people together.
p273
aVWe should not underestimate it.
p274
aa(lp275
V"Know thyself,"
p276
aVthat is the journey of self-expression and self-realization
p277
aVthat we are traveling.
p278
aVNow I don't pretend to have all the answers,
p279
aVbut I know that me as an individual
p280
aVand we as a nation
p281
aVwelcome this community
p282
aVof ideas worth spreading.
p283
aVThis is a very interesting journey.
p284
aVI welcome you on board
p285
aVfor us to engage and discuss new ideas
p286
aVof how to bring people together
p287
aVthrough cultural initiatives and discussions.
p288
aVFamiliarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it.
p289
aa(lp290
VLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Shokran.

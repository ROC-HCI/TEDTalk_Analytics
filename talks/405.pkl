VWhat technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty?
p5
aVAnd what I found was quite surprising.
p6
aVWe started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century,
p7
aVand how they'd been improved, and very simple things turned out.
p8
aVYou'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water,
p9
aVbut it's actually the opposite.
p10
aVAnd so very simple things \u2014 off-the-shelf technologies
p11
aVthat we could easily find on the then-early Web \u2014
p12
aVwould clearly make a huge difference to that problem.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut I also, in looking at more powerful technologies
p15
aVand nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging
p16
aVkind of digital technologies, became very concerned
p17
aVabout the potential for abuse.
p18
aVIf you think about it, in history, a long, long time ago
p19
aVwe dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual.
p20
aVWe came up with something \u2014 the Ten Commandments: Thou shalt not kill.
p21
aVThat's a, kind of a one-on-one thing.
p22
aVWe organized into cities. We had many people.
p23
aVAnd to keep the many from tyrannizing the one,
p24
aVwe came up with concepts like individual liberty.
p25
aVAnd then, to have to deal with large groups,
p26
aVsay, at the nation-state level,
p27
aVand we had to have mutual non-aggression,
p28
aVor through a series of conflicts, we eventually came to
p29
aVa rough international bargain to largely keep the peace.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut now we have a new situation, really what people call
p32
aVan asymmetric situation, where technology is so powerful
p33
aVthat it extends beyond a nation-state.
p34
aVIt's not the nation-states that have potential access
p35
aVto mass destruction, but individuals.
p36
aVAnd this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital.
p37
aVWe saw genome sequences.
p38
aVYou can download the gene sequences
p39
aVof pathogens off the Internet if you want to,
p40
aVand clearly someone recently \u2014 I saw in a science magazine \u2014
p41
aVthey said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around.
p42
aVIf people want to use it in their labs for working on research,
p43
aVjust reconstruct it yourself,
p44
aVbecause, you know, it might break in FedEx.
p45
aVSo that this is possible to do this is not deniable.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo individuals in small groups super-empowered by access to these
p48
aVkinds of self-replicating technologies, whether it be biological
p49
aVor other, are clearly a danger in our world.
p50
aVAnd the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic.
p51
aVAnd we really don't have experience with pandemics,
p52
aVand we're also not very good as a society at acting
p53
aVto things we don't have direct and sort of gut-level experience with.
p54
aVSo it's not in our nature to pre-act.
p55
aVAnd in this case, piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem,
p56
aVbecause it only super-empowers people more.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo the solution has to be, as people like Russell and Einstein
p59
aVand others imagine in a conversation that existed
p60
aVin a much stronger form, I think, early in the 20th century,
p61
aVthat the solution had to be not just the head but the heart.
p62
aVYou know, public policy and moral progress.
p63
aVThe bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power.
p64
aVWe get our individual rights by society protecting us from others
p65
aVnot doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal.
p66
aVAnd so to limit the danger of these new things, we have to limit,
p67
aVultimately, the ability of individuals
p68
aVto have access, essentially, to pandemic power.
p69
aVWe also have to have sensible defense, because no limitation
p70
aVis going to prevent a crazy person from doing something.
p71
aVAnd you know, and the troubling thing is that
p72
aVit's much easier to do something bad than to defend
p73
aVagainst all possible bad things,
p74
aVso the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo these are the kind of thoughts I was thinking in 1999 and 2000,
p77
aVand my friends told me I was getting really depressed,
p78
aVand they were really worried about me.
p79
aVAnd then I signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this
p80
aVand moved into a hotel room in New York
p81
aVwith one room full of books on the Plague,
p82
aVand you know, nuclear bombs exploding in New York
p83
aVwhere I would be within the circle, and so on.
p84
aVAnd then I was there on September 11th,
p85
aVand I stood in the streets with everyone.
p86
aVAnd it was quite an experience to be there.
p87
aVI got up the next morning and walked out of the city,
p88
aVand all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street
p89
aVand ready to go down and start taking the rubble away.
p90
aVAnd I walked down the middle, up to the train station,
p91
aVand everything below 14th Street was closed.
p92
aVIt was quite a compelling experience, but not really, I suppose,
p93
aVa surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books.
p94
aVIt was always a surprise that it happened then and there,
p95
aVbut it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd everyone then started writing about this.
p98
aVThousands of people started writing about this.
p99
aVAnd I eventually abandoned the book, and then Chris called me
p100
aVto talk at the conference. I really don't talk about this anymore
p101
aVbecause, you know, there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on.
p102
aVBut I agreed to come and say a few things about this.
p103
aVAnd I would say that we can't give up the rule of law
p104
aVto fight an asymmetric threat, which is what we seem to be doing
p105
aVbecause of the present, the people that are in power,
p106
aVbecause that's to give up the thing that makes civilization.
p107
aVAnd we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing,
p108
aVbecause a million-dollar act
p109
aVcauses a billion dollars of damage, causes a trillion dollar response
p110
aVwhich is largely ineffective and arguably, probably almost certainly,
p111
aVhas made the problem worse.
p112
aVSo we can't fight the thing with a million-to-one cost,
p113
aVone-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo after giving up on the book \u2014 and I had the great honor
p116
aVto be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago,
p117
aVand to work through venture capital on the innovative side,
p118
aVand to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as
p119
aVsome of these big problems.
p120
aVThings where, you know, a factor of 10 difference
p121
aVcan make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome.
p122
aVI've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality
p123
aVand excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk.
p124
aVIt's overwhelming at times. I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipedia
p125
aVso I can understand at least a little of what people are talking about
p126
aVwho come through the doors.
p127
aa(lp128
VBut I wanted to share with you three areas
p129
aVthat I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems
p130
aVthat I was talking about in the Wired article.
p131
aVThe first is this whole area of education,
p132
aVand it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer.
p133
aVAnd that is to say that there's a lot of legs left in Moore's Law.
p134
aVThe most advanced transistors today are at 65 nanometers,
p135
aVand we've seen, and I've had the pleasure to invest
p136
aVin, companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend Moore's Law
p137
aVall the way down to roughly the 10 nanometer scale.
p138
aVAnother factor of, say, six in dimensional reduction,
p139
aVwhich should give us about another factor of 100 in raw improvement
p140
aVin what the chips can do. And so, to put that in practical terms,
p141
aVif something costs about 1,000 dollars today,
p142
aVsay, the best personal computer you can buy, that might be its cost,
p143
aVI think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollars. Okay?
p144
aVNow, just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020
p145
aVas a tool for education.
p146
aa(lp147
VI think the challenge for us is \u2014
p148
aVI'm very certain that that will happen, the challenge is,
p149
aVwill we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net
p150
aVto let us take advantage of that device?
p151
aVI'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers,
p152
aVbut we don't have very good software for them.
p153
aVAnd it's only in retrospect, after the better software comes along,
p154
aVand you take it and you run it on a ten-year-old machine, you say,
p155
aVGod, the machine was that fast?
p156
aVI remember when they took the Apple Mac interface
p157
aVand they put it back on the Apple II.
p158
aVThe Apple II was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface,
p159
aVwe just didn't know how to do it at the time.
p160
aVSo given that we know and should believe \u2014
p161
aVbecause Moore's Law's been, like, a constant,
p162
aVI mean, it's just been very predictable progress
p163
aVover the last 40 years or whatever.
p164
aVWe can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020.
p165
aVIt's great that we have initiatives to say,
p166
aVlet's go create the education and educate people in the world,
p167
aVbecause that's a great force for peace.
p168
aVAnd we can give everyone in the world a $100 computer
p169
aVor a $10 computer in the next 15 years.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe second area that I'm focusing on is the environmental problem,
p172
aVbecause that's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world.
p173
aVWe'll hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly.
p174
aVThe thing that we see as the kind of Moore's Law trend
p175
aVthat's driving improvement in our ability to address
p176
aVthe environmental problem is new materials.
p177
aVWe have a challenge, because the urban population is growing
p178
aVin this century from two billion to six billion
p179
aVin a very short amount of time. People are moving to the cities.
p180
aVThey all need clean water, they need energy, they need transportation,
p181
aVand we want them to develop in a green way.
p182
aVWe're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors.
p183
aVWe've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency,
p184
aVbut the consumer sector, especially in America, is very inefficient.
p185
aVBut these new materials bring such incredible innovations
p186
aVthat there's a strong basis for hope that these things
p187
aVwill be so profitable that they can be brought to the market.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd I want to give you a specific example of a new material
p190
aVthat was discovered 15 years ago.
p191
aVIf we take carbon nanotubes, you know, Iijima discovered them in 1991,
p192
aVthey just have incredible properties.
p193
aVAnd these are the kinds of things we're going to discover
p194
aVas we start to engineer at the nano scale.
p195
aVTheir strength: they're almost the strongest material,
p196
aVtensile strength material known.
p197
aVThey're very, very stiff. They stretch very, very little.
p198
aVIn two dimensions, if you make, like, a fabric out of them,
p199
aVthey're 30 times stronger than Kevlar.
p200
aVAnd if you make a three-dimensional structure, like a buckyball,
p201
aVthey have all sorts of incredible properties.
p202
aVIf you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them,
p203
aVthey repair themselves; they go zip and they repair the hole
p204
aVin femtoseconds, which is not \u2014 is really quick.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVIf you shine a light on them, they produce electricity.
p207
aVIn fact, if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire.
p208
aVIf you put electricity on them, they emit light.
p209
aVIf you run current through them, you can run 1,000 times more current
p210
aVthrough one of these than through a piece of metal.
p211
aVYou can make both p- and n-type semiconductors,
p212
aVwhich means you can make transistors out of them.
p213
aVThey conduct heat along their length but not across \u2014
p214
aVwell, there is no width, but not in the other direction
p215
aVif you stack them up; that's a property of carbon fiber also.
p216
aVIf you put particles in them, and they go shooting out the tip \u2014
p217
aVthey're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns.
p218
aVThe inside of the nanotubes is so small \u2014
p219
aVthe smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers \u2014
p220
aVthat it's basically a quantum world.
p221
aVIt's a strange place inside a nanotube.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd so we begin to see, and we've seen business plans already,
p224
aVwhere the kind of things Lisa Randall's talking about are in there.
p225
aVI had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about
p226
aVWitten's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand
p227
aVwhat the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial.
p228
aVSo inside of a nanotube, we're really at the limit here.
p229
aVSo what we see is with these and other new materials
p230
aVthat we can do things with different properties \u2014 lighter, stronger \u2014
p231
aVand apply these new materials to the environmental problems.
p232
aVNew materials that can make water,
p233
aVnew materials that can make fuel cells work better,
p234
aVnew materials that catalyze chemical reactions,
p235
aVthat cut pollution and so on.
p236
aVEthanol \u2014 new ways of making ethanol.
p237
aVNew ways of making electric transportation.
p238
aVThe whole green dream \u2014 because it can be profitable.
p239
aVAnd we've dedicated \u2014 we've just raised a new fund,
p240
aVwe dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments.
p241
aVWe believe that Genentech, the Compaq, the Lotus, the Sun,
p242
aVthe Netscape, the Amazon, the Google in these fields
p243
aVare yet to be found, because this materials revolution
p244
aVwill drive these things forward.
p245
aa(lp246
VThe third area that we're working on,
p247
aVand we just announced last week \u2014 we were all in New York.
p248
aVWe raised 200 million dollars in a specialty fund
p249
aVto work on a pandemic in biodefense.
p250
aVAnd to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raised
p251
aVwas a $400 million fund, so this for us is a very substantial fund.
p252
aVAnd what we did, over the last few months \u2014 well, a few months ago,
p253
aVRay Kurzweil and I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times
p254
aVabout how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous.
p255
aVAnd John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned, [unclear],
p256
aVand we started looking around at what the world was doing
p257
aVabout being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd so we asked ourselves, you know, can we find innovative things
p260
aVthat will go fill these gaps? And Brooks told me in a break here,
p261
aVhe said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep,
p262
aVbecause there's so many great technologies out there,
p263
aVwe're essentially buried. And we need them, you know.
p264
aVWe have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling
p265
aVthat still works, roughly. That's Tamiflu.
p266
aVBut Tamiflu \u2014 the virus is resistant. It is resistant to Tamiflu.
p267
aVWe've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well
p268
aVso that the viral resistance \u2014 we need several anti-virals.
p269
aVWe need better surveillance.
p270
aVWe need networks that can find out what's going on.
p271
aVWe need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has
p272
aVa strain of flu which we have only identified very recently.
p273
aVWe've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly.
p274
aVWe need new anti-virals and cocktails. We need new kinds of vaccines.
p275
aVVaccines that are broad spectrum.
p276
aVVaccines that we can manufacture quickly.
p277
aVCocktails, more polyvalent vaccines.
p278
aVYou normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains.
p279
aVWe need \u2014 we don't know where this thing is going.
p280
aVWe believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps,
p281
aVwe have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic.
p282
aVAnd the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic
p283
aVis about a factor of 1,000 in deaths
p284
aVand certainly enormous economic impact.
p285
aVSo we're very excited because we think we can fund 10,
p286
aVor speed up 10 projects and see them come to market
p287
aVin the next couple years that will address this.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo if we can address, use technology, help address education,
p290
aVhelp address the environment, help address the pandemic,
p291
aVdoes that solve the larger problem that I was talking about
p292
aVin the Wired article? And I'm afraid the answer is really no,
p293
aVbecause you can't solve a problem with the management of technology
p294
aVwith more technology.
p295
aVIf we let an unlimited amount of power loose, then we will \u2014
p296
aVa very small number of people will be able to abuse it.
p297
aVWe can't fight at a million-to-one disadvantage.
p298
aVSo what we need to do is, we need better policy.
p299
aVAnd for example, some things we could do
p300
aVthat would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now
p301
aVbut perhaps with the change of administration would be \u2014 use markets.
p302
aa(lp303
VMarkets are a very strong force.
p304
aVFor example, rather than trying to regulate away problems,
p305
aVwhich probably won't work, if we could price
p306
aVinto the cost of doing business, the cost of catastrophe,
p307
aVso that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe
p308
aVwould have to take insurance against that risk.
p309
aVSo if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on.
p310
aVBut it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators;
p311
aVyou'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe.
p312
aVAnd if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly,
p313
aVyou can use a more powerful force, a market force,
p314
aVto provide feedback.
p315
aVHow could you keep the law?
p316
aVI think the law would be a really good thing to keep.
p317
aVWell, you have to hold people accountable.
p318
aVThe law requires accountability.
p319
aVToday scientists, technologists, businessmen, engineers
p320
aVdon't have any personal responsibility
p321
aVfor the consequences of their actions.
p322
aVSo if you tie that \u2014 you have to tie that back with the law.
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd finally, I think we have to do something that's not really \u2014
p325
aVit's almost unacceptable to say this \u2014 which,
p326
aVwe have to begin to design the future.
p327
aVWe can't pick the future, but we can steer the future.
p328
aVOur investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu
p329
aVis affecting the distribution of possible outcomes.
p330
aVWe may not be able to stop it, but the likelihood
p331
aVthat it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem.
p332
aVSo we can design the future if we choose what kind of things
p333
aVwe want to have happen and not have happen,
p334
aVand steer us to a lower-risk place.
p335
aVVice President Gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory
p336
aVinto a lower probability of catastrophic risk.
p337
aa(lp338
VBut above all, what we have to do is we have to help the good guys,
p339
aVthe people on the defensive side,
p340
aVhave an advantage over the people who want to abuse things.
p341
aVAnd what we have to do to do that
p342
aVis we have to limit access to certain information.
p343
aVAnd growing up as we have, and holding very high
p344
aVthe value of free speech, this is a hard thing for us to accept \u2014
p345
aVfor all of us to accept.
p346
aVIt's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember,
p347
aVyou know, Galileo essentially locked up,
p348
aVand who are still fighting this battle against the church.
p349
aVBut that's the price of having a civilization.
p350
aVThe price of retaining the rule of law
p351
aVis to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power.
p352
aVThank you.

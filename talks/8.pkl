VKurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight
p5
aVbut is sufficiently reticent \u2014 or at least pretends to be \u2014
p6
aVthat he asked me to question him rather than speaking.
p7
aVIn fact what we're going to talk about,
p8
aVI think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served
p9
aVby a conversation than an address.
p10
aVAnd I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.
p11
aa(lp12
VDan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center,
p13
aVmany people have flocked to downtown New York to see
p14
aVand pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.
p15
aVNow, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches
p16
aVon a new way for people to visit and view the scene.
p17
aa(lp18
VJim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.
p19
aVThere's a new place in New York
p20
aVwhere the crowds are thickest \u2014 Ground Zero.
p21
aa(lp22
VTourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.
p23
aVThis was \u2014 out of all the tourist sites in New York City \u2014
p24
aVthis was her number-one pick.
p25
aa(lp26
VJA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway.
p27
aa(lp28
VTourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.
p29
aa(lp30
VJA: Even on the coldest winter days.
p31
aVTo honor and remember.
p32
aa(lp33
VTourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here.
p34
aVThis is ours.
p35
aa(lp36
VJA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become
p37
aVa bit of a problem.
p38
aa(lp39
VTourist: I think that people are very frustrated
p40
aVthat they're not able to get closer to see what's going on.
p41
aa(lp42
VJA: But that is about to change.
p43
aVIn record time,
p44
aVa team of architects and construction workers
p45
aVdesigned and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration
p46
aVand bring people closer.
p47
aa(lp48
VMan: They'll get an incredible panorama
p49
aVand understand, I think more completely,
p50
aVthe sheer totality of the destruction of the place.
p51
aa(lp52
VJA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike
p53
aVmost any other tourist site in America.
p54
aVUnlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument,
p55
aVpeople come here to see what's no longer there.
p56
aa(lp57
VDavid Rockwell: The first experience people will have here
p58
aVwhen they see this is not as a construction site
p59
aVbut as this incredibly moving burial ground.
p60
aa(lp61
VJA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them
p62
aVwith their own memorials the way they already have
p63
aValong the current perimeter.
p64
aa(lp65
VTourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.
p66
aa(lp67
VJA: The ramps are made of simple material \u2014
p68
aVthe kind of plywood you see at construction sites \u2014
p69
aVwhich is really the whole point.
p70
aVIn the face of America's worst destruction
p71
aVpeople are building again.
p72
aVJim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.
p73
aa(lp74
VKA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment,
p75
aVbut certainly David you are known as \u2014 I know, a phrase you hate \u2014
p76
aVan entertainment architect.
p77
aVYour work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.
p78
aa(lp79
VDR: I like that word.
p80
aa(lp81
VKA: It's about pleasure \u2014 casinos and hotels and restaurants.
p82
aVHow did the shock that all of us \u2014 and especially all of us in New York \u2014
p83
aVfelt on the 11th of September transmute
p84
aVinto your desire to do this thing?
p85
aa(lp86
VDR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th,
p87
aVI felt myself in the role originally \u2014
p88
aVfirst of all as someone who lives in Tribeca
p89
aVand whose neighborhood was devastated,
p90
aVand as someone who works less than a mile from there \u2014
p91
aVthat I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me
p92
aVin my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm
p93
aVabout creating the places we had been creating.
p94
aVIn fact we're finishing a book which is called "Pleasure,"
p95
aVwhich is about sensual pleasure in spaces.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut I've got to tell you \u2014 it became impossible to do that.
p98
aVWe were really paralyzed.
p99
aVAnd I found myself the Friday after September 11th \u2014
p100
aVtwo days afterwards \u2014
p101
aVliterally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.
p102
aVWe gave the office a few days off.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd in discussing this with other architects,
p105
aVwe had seen people saying in the press
p106
aVthat they should rebuild the towers as they were \u2014
p107
aVthey should rebuild them 50 stories taller.
p108
aVAnd I thought it was astonishing to speculate,
p109
aVas if this were a competition,
p110
aVon something that was such a fresh wound.
p111
aVAnd I had a series of discussions \u2014
p112
aVfirst with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this,
p113
aVand several other people \u2014
p114
aVand really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something.
p115
aVAnd that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help
p116
aVwasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios,
p117
aVbut to help right now.
p118
aVSo we tried to come up with a way,
p119
aVas a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.
p120
aVAnd that was the mission that we came up with.
p121
aa(lp122
VKA: Were you conscious of suddenly \u2014
p123
aVas a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants \u2014
p124
aVsuddenly fulfilling needs?
p125
aa(lp126
VDR: Well what I was aware of was,
p127
aVthere was this overwhelming need to act now.
p128
aVAnd we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.
p129
aVThere was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.
p130
aVThey moved to an abandoned school.
p131
aVWe took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists,
p132
aVand over four days \u2014 it was like this urban barn-raising \u2014
p133
aVto renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.
p134
aVIt was just extraordinary.
p135
aVTom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed
p136
aVand it became this cathartic experience for us.
p137
aa(lp138
VKA: And that was done, effectively,
p139
aVby October 8 or something?
p140
aa(lp141
VDR: Yeah.
p142
aa(lp143
VKA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something
p144
aVas substantial as this project \u2014 and this is only one of four
p145
aVthat you've designed to surround the site \u2014
p146
aVyou must have run up against the incredibly byzantine,
p147
aVentrenched bureaucracy and powers that be
p148
aVin New York real estate and New York politics.
p149
aa(lp150
VDR: Well, it's a funny thing.
p151
aVWe finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.
p152
aVI was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.
p153
aVAnd I sat in on several meetings.
p154
aVAnd there were the most circuitous grand plans
p155
aVthat had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.
p156
aVAnd the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled,
p157
aVand there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process.
p158
aVAnd it wasn't an inclusive group.
p159
aVSo we said, what is \u2014
p160
aa(lp161
VKA: It was not an inclusive group?
p162
aa(lp163
VDR: It was not an inclusive group.
p164
aVIt was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group
p165
aVthat was not representative of the city.
p166
aa(lp167
VKA: Shocking.
p168
aa(lp169
VDR: Yeah, surprising.
p170
aVSo Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.
p171
aVThe city actually approached us.
p172
aVWe first approached the city about Pier 94.
p173
aVWe saw how PS 234 worked.
p174
aVThe families \u2014 the victims of the families \u2014
p175
aVwere going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.
p176
aa(lp177
VKA: On the Hudson River?
p178
aa(lp179
VDR: Yeah. And the city actually \u2014 through Tim Zagat initially,
p180
aVand then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani \u2014
p181
aVsaid, "You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now,
p182
aVbut we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero
p183
aVthat we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families,
p184
aVand a way to protect it from the weather."
p185
aa(lp186
VSo I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin,
p187
aVand I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life.
p188
aVIt was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it,
p189
aVwhere the families of the victims had left notes to them.
p190
aVAnd there was no mediation between us and the experience.
p191
aVThere was no filter.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street,
p194
aVthe roof of our building \u2014 we can see the World Trade Towers prominently \u2014
p195
aVand I saw the first building collapse from a conference room
p196
aVon the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up.
p197
aVAnd then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.
p198
aVAnd it was amazing how much harder it was
p199
aVto believe in real life than it was on TV.
p200
aVThere was something about the comfort of the filter
p201
aVand how much information was between us and the experience.
p202
aVSo seeing this in a very simple,
p203
aVdignified way was a very powerful experience.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo we went back to the city and said
p206
aVwe're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform,
p207
aVbut we've spent some time down there.
p208
aVAt the same time the city had this need.
p209
aVThey were looking for a solution
p210
aVto deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day
p211
aVwho were going down there, that had nowhere to go.
p212
aVAnd there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.
p213
aVSo dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.
p214
aVThere was a way \u2014 there had to be a way \u2014
p215
aVto get people to move around the site.
p216
aa(lp217
VKA: But then you've got to figure out a way \u2014
p218
aVwe will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits
p219
aVand getting everybody on board \u2014 but simply funding this thing.
p220
aVIt looks like a fairly simple thing,
p221
aVbut this was a half a million dollar project?
p222
aa(lp223
VDR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded,
p224
aVit wasn't going to happen.
p225
aVAnd we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen
p226
aVby the end of the Giuliani administration,
p227
aVthen everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT
p228
aVand the Police Department and all of the \u2014
p229
aVwe were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time,
p230
aVand it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management.
p231
aVThis incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this,
p232
aVand they sensed that this needed to happen.
p233
aa(lp234
VKA: And there was therefore this ticking clock,
p235
aVbecause Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.
p236
aa(lp237
VDR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this \u2014
p238
aVwe had to work with the families of the victims,
p239
aVthrough the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening.
p240
aVBecause this didn't want to be a surprise.
p241
aVAnd we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York,
p242
aVbecause the key was not raising a lot of objection
p243
aVand sort of working as quietly as possible.
p244
aa(lp245
VWe came up with the idea of setting up a foundation,
p246
aVmainly because when we found a contractor who would build this,
p247
aVhe would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money.
p248
aVThere needed to be a foundation in place.
p249
aVSo we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was
p250
aVone major developer in New York \u2014
p251
aa(lp252
VKA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess?
p253
aa(lp254
VDR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center,
p255
aVif that helps anyone \u2014 volunteered to help.
p256
aVAnd we met with him.
p257
aVThe prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars.
p258
aVAnd Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country,
p259
aVvolunteered to do it at cost.
p260
aVSo this developer said, "You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense."
p261
aVAnd we said, "That's incredible!"
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd I think this was the 21st,
p264
aVand we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.
p265
aVAnd we had to start construction the next day.
p266
aVWe had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice,
p267
aVand the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform
p268
aVabout half the size that we had drawn it.
p269
aa(lp270
VKA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get
p271
aVthe tiny little Stonehenge, I guess?
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VDR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.
p275
aVThere was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul \u2014
p276
aVthat this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified,
p277
aVand a place to reflect and remember.
p278
aVAnd I've got to say that we spent a lot of time
p279
aVin putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul \u2014
p280
aVwhich is just to the right \u2014 and moving around the site.
p281
aVAnd I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd I think people were amazed at two things \u2014
p284
aVI think they were amazed at the destruction,
p285
aVbut I think there was a sense of disbelief
p286
aVabout the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving.
p287
aVJust the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said,
p290
aV"I'm going to lock the door, because this developer
p291
aVwill not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this."
p292
aVAnd we said, "Well, this is half the size,
p293
aVit doesn't have any of the design features
p294
aVthat have been agreed upon by everyone \u2014 everyone in the city.
p295
aVWe'd have to go back to the beginning to do this."
p296
aVAnd I convinced him that we should leave the room
p297
aVwith the agreement to build it as designed.
p298
aa(lp299
VThe next day I got an email from the developer
p300
aVsaying that he was withdrawing all funding.
p301
aVSo we didn't know what to do,
p302
aVbut we decided to cast a very wide net.
p303
aVWe emailed out letters to as many people as we could \u2014
p304
aVseveral people in the audience here \u2014 who were very helpful.
p305
aa(lp306
VKA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point?
p307
aa(lp308
VDR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead.
p309
aVHe had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead.
p310
aVWe knew that one way or another this was going to happen.
p311
aVAnd we just felt it had to happen.
p312
aa(lp313
VKA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation.
p314
aVRichard, I think very correctly,
p315
aVmade the point at the beginning \u2014
p316
aVbefore all the chair designers came out \u2014
p317
aVabout the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions
p318
aVon this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting.
p319
aVIt seems to me with this,
p320
aVthat it was the opposite of that.
p321
aVThis was an unprecedented, singular design problem.
p322
aa(lp323
VDR: Well here's the issue:
p324
aVwe knew that this was not in the sense of \u2014
p325
aVwe think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial.
p326
aVIt was important that this not be categorized as a memorial.
p327
aVThat this was a place for people to reflect, to remember \u2014
p328
aVa kind of quiet place.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo it led us to using design solutions
p331
aVthat created as few filters between the viewer \u2014
p332
aVas we said about the families' platform \u2014 and the experience as possible.
p333
aVIt's all incredibly humble material.
p334
aVIt's scaffolding and plywood.
p335
aVAnd it allows \u2014 by sort of the procession of the movement,
p336
aVup by Saint Paul's and down the other side \u2014
p337
aVit gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground
p338
aVto where you get the 360 degree view.
p339
aa(lp340
VBut the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.
p341
aVOne of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.
p342
aVBecause when we looked at the four platforms around the site,
p343
aVone of which is an upgrade of the families' platform,
p344
aVwe knew that these had to be moveable
p345
aVto respond to changing conditions,
p346
aVand the changing definition of what Ground Zero is.
p347
aa(lp348
VKA: Your work \u2014 I mean, we've talked about this before \u2014
p349
aVa lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on
p350
aVthe temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things,
p351
aVand a kind of "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,"
p352
aVsort of sense of existence.
p353
aVThis is clearly not a work for the ages.
p354
aVYou know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here.
p355
aVDid that require, as an architect,
p356
aVa new way of thinking about what you were doing?
p357
aVTo think of it as this purely temporary installation?
p358
aa(lp359
VDR: No, I don't think so.
p360
aVI think this is, obviously, substantially different
p361
aVfrom anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it.
p362
aVWhere it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is,
p363
aVnumber one \u2014 the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done.
p364
aVAnd Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller
p365
aVand all the people within the city \u2014
p366
aVNorman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding,
p367
aVoffered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.
p368
aVSo the notion of collaboration \u2014
p369
aVI think this reinforces how important that is.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd in terms of the temporary nature of it,
p372
aVour goal was not to create something
p373
aVthat would be there longer than it needed to be.
p374
aVI think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue
p375
aVthat we felt may not have been happening enough in this city,
p376
aVabout what's really happening there.
p377
aa(lp378
VAnd a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address,
p379
aVwhere he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial.
p380
aVWhich was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people.
p381
aVAnd I think regardless of what the position is about how
p382
aVthis sacred piece of land is to be used,
p383
aVhaving it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter,
p384
aVI think makes it a more powerful dialogue.
p385
aVAnd that's what we were interested in.
p386
aVSo that, very much, is in the realm of things
p387
aVI've been interested in before.
p388
aa(lp389
VKA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.
p390
aVIt enables that conversation to get serious.
p391
aVAnd six months after the fact \u2014
p392
aVand only a few months away from the site being cleaned \u2014
p393
aVwe are very quickly, now, getting to the point
p394
aVwhere those conversations about what should go there are getting serious.
p395
aVDo you have \u2014 having been as physically involved in the site
p396
aVas you have been doing this project \u2014 have any ideas about
p397
aVwhat should or shouldn't be done?
p398
aa(lp399
VDR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate \u2014
p400
aVI think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.
p401
aVThe Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings,
p402
aVwhich had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.
p403
aa(lp404
VKA: But it had some really terrible ideas.
p405
aa(lp406
VDR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas,
p407
aVwhere I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.
p408
aVAnd I think there should be a broader \u2014 which there's starting to be \u2014
p409
aVthe dialogue is really opening up to,
p410
aVwhat does this site really want to be?
p411
aVAnd I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out,
p412
aVthat it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion.
p413
aVThere's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive,
p414
aVabout depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over,
p415
aVso that there's one uninterrupted piece of land.
p416
aa(lp417
VKA: Well, I think that's interesting.
p418
aVAnd it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate
p419
aVto discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now,
p420
aVwhich is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture,
p421
aVas what it had done to this city and that huge plaza.
p422
aVIs this an opportunity, is the silver lining \u2014
p423
aVa silver lining, here \u2014 to rebuild
p424
aVsome more traditional city grid, or not?
p425
aa(lp426
VDR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage
p427
aVin a discussion of why we live in cities.
p428
aVAnd why do we live in places where such dissimilar people
p429
aVcollide up against us each day?
p430
aVI don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces,
p431
aVregardless of what the number is.
p432
aVSo yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.
p433
aa(lp434
VAnd in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.
p435
aa(lp436
VKA: Which was the building just north of the Towers?
p437
aa(lp438
VDR: Right, which the towers fell into.
p439
aVAnd the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage
p440
aVthat they're not re-opening the street
p441
aVto connect that back to the rest of the city.
p442
aVI think a public dialogue \u2014 I think, you know,
p443
aVI'd like to see an international competition,
p444
aVand a call for ideas for uses.
p445
aa(lp446
VKA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing,
p447
aVwhether it's what amount of shopping?
p448
aa(lp449
VDR: Right. And we're looking for other things.
p450
aVThis small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.
p451
aVIncluding taking a small piece adjacent to the site
p452
aVand inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice
p453
aVin New York to do artist housing.
p454
aVAnd find other ways to encourage the discussion
p455
aVto be against sort of monolithic, single solutions,
p456
aVand more about a multiplicity of things.
p457
aa(lp458
VKA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video
p459
aVof the experience of being on this platform?
p460
aa(lp461
VDR: John Kamen \u2014 who's here, actually \u2014 put together
p462
aVa two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use.
p463
aVSo I thought that would be good to end with.
p464
aa(lp465
VDR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west.
p466
aVOne of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration
p467
aVwas I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was.
p468
aVAnd essentially our structure was designed to be written on.
p469
aa(lp470
VKA: As you say, it's not a memorial.
p471
aVBut were you conscious of memorials? The Vietnam Memorial?
p472
aVThose kinds of forms?
p473
aa(lp474
VDR: We certainly did as much research as we could,
p475
aVand we were conscious of other memorials.
p476
aVAnd also the complexity and length of time they really take to do.
p477
aVIt's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City,
p478
aVwhich is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc, spontaneous solution
p479
aVthat expanded on Union Square
p480
aVand the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already.
p481
aa(lp482
VThe scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable.
p483
aa(lp484
VWhat's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed,
p485
aVso that what you're aware of
p486
aVis not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero,
p487
aVbut all of the buildings around it \u2014
p488
aVand the scars on the building around it, which are enormous.
p489
aVThis shows Saint Paul's on the left.
p490
aa(lp491
VKA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers
p492
aVfor making this happen and getting this done.
p493
aVBut the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection,
p494
aVand its being there,
p495
aValmost before you could believe
p496
aVthat a response of this magnitude could be accomplished,
p497
aVis part of its extraordinary \u2014
p498
aVI don't know if beauty is the word \u2014
p499
aVbut presence.
p500
aa(lp501
VDR: It was an honor to do.
p502
aVAnd we were thrilled to be able to show it here.

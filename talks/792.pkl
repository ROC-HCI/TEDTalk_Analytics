VFor some time I have been interested in
p5
aVthe placebo effect,
p6
aVwhich might seem like an odd thing
p7
aVfor a magician to be interested in,
p8
aVunless you think of it in the terms that I do,
p9
aVwhich is, "Something fake
p10
aVis believed in enough by somebody
p11
aVthat it becomes something real."
p12
aVIn other words, sugar pills
p13
aVhave a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies,
p14
aVthe placebo effect,
p15
aVjust because the person thinks
p16
aVthat what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical
p17
aVor some sort of a \u2014
p18
aVfor pain management, for example,
p19
aVif they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body
p20
aVcalled the placebo effect.
p21
aVSomething fake becomes
p22
aVsomething real
p23
aVbecause of someone's perception of it.
p24
aa(lp25
VIn order for us to understand each other,
p26
aVI want to start by showing you a rudimentary,
p27
aVvery simple magic trick.
p28
aVAnd I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick
p29
aVthat's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s.
p30
aVI learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s.
p31
aVI'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.
p32
aVAnd then I'll explain why I explained it.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo, here's what happens.
p35
aVThe knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine.
p36
aVI'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this.
p37
aVI'll get my sleeve back.
p38
aVAnd to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve
p39
aVI'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.
p40
aVThat way you can see that at no time
p41
aVcan anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there
p42
aVnothing can go up or down my sleeve.
p43
aVAnd the object of this is quite simple.
p44
aVI'm going to open my hand,
p45
aVand hopefully, if all is well,
p46
aVmy pure animal magnetism will hold the knife.
p47
aVIn fact it's held so tightly in place
p48
aVthat I can shake it,
p49
aVand the knife does not come off.
p50
aVNothing goes up or down my sleeve,
p51
aVno trickery. And you can examine everything.
p52
aVTa-da!
p53
aV(Applause)
p54
aa(lp55
VSo, this is a trick that I often teach to young children
p56
aVthat are interested in magic, because you can learn
p57
aVa great deal about deception by studying
p58
aVthis very \u2014 even though it's a very simple trick methodologically.
p59
aVProbably many of you in the room know this trick.
p60
aVWhat happens is this.
p61
aVI hold the knife in my hand.
p62
aVI say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist
p63
aVto make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve,
p64
aVthat is a lie.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe reason I'm holding onto my wrist
p67
aVis because that's actually the secret
p68
aVof the illusion.
p69
aVIn a moment when my hand moves from facing you
p70
aVto being away from you,
p71
aVthis finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift
p72
aVfrom where it is, to a position
p73
aVpointing out like this.
p74
aVNice one.
p75
aVSomeone who didn't have a childhood is out there.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VSo, it goes like this, from here, right.
p79
aVAnd as I move around my finger shifts.
p80
aVAnd we could talk about why this is deceptive,
p81
aVwhy you don't notice there are only three fingers down here,
p82
aVbecause the mind, and the way it processes information,
p83
aVit doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them.
p84
aVBut that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up.
p85
aVObviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism,
p86
aVbut by chicanery,
p87
aVmy index finger being there.
p88
aVAnd then when I close my finger, same thing,
p89
aVas I move back, this motion
p90
aVkind of covers the moving back of my finger.
p91
aVI take this hand away. You give the knife out.
p92
aVThere is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, (Laughter)
p95
aVwhat does that have to do with the placebo effect?
p96
aVI read a study a year or so ago
p97
aVthat really blew my mind wide open.
p98
aVI'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me,
p99
aVwas an astonishing thing.
p100
aVIt turns out that if you administer
p101
aVa placebo in the form of a white pill,
p102
aVthat's like aspirin shaped \u2014
p103
aVit's just a round white pill \u2014 it has some certain measurable effect.
p104
aVBut if you change the form that you give the placebo in,
p105
aVlike you make a smaller pill,
p106
aVand color it blue, and stamp a letter into it,
p107
aVit is actually measurably more effective.
p108
aVEven though neither one of these things
p109
aVhas any pharmaceutical \u2014 they're sugar pills.
p110
aVBut a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.
p111
aVWhat? (Laughter) That really flipped me out.
p112
aa(lp113
VTurns out though, that that's not even where it stops.
p114
aVIf you have capsules,
p115
aVthey're more effective than tablets in any form.
p116
aVA colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other
p117
aVis better than a white capsule.
p118
aVDosage has something to do with this.
p119
aVOne pill twice a day
p120
aVis not as good at three pills \u2014
p121
aVI don't remember the statistic now. Sorry.
p122
aVBut the point is ...
p123
aV(Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it.
p124
aVAnd the form has something to do with it.
p125
aVAnd if you want the ultimate in placebo,
p126
aVyou've go to the needle.
p127
aVRight? A syringe with some inert \u2014
p128
aVa couple CCs of some inert something,
p129
aVand you inject this into a patient ...
p130
aVWell this is such a powerful image in their mind,
p131
aVit's so much stronger than the white pill.
p132
aa(lp133
VIt's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you
p134
aVsome other time when we have slides.
p135
aVThe point is
p136
aVthe white pill is not as good as the blue pill
p137
aVis not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle.
p138
aVAnd none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality,
p139
aVit's only your belief that makes it real
p140
aVin your body and makes a stronger effect.
p141
aVI wanted to see if I could take that idea
p142
aVand apply it to a magic trick.
p143
aVAnd take something that is obviously a fake trick
p144
aVand make it seem real.
p145
aVAnd we know from that study
p146
aVthat when you want reality, you go to the needle.
p147
aa(lp148
VThis is a seven-inch hatpin. It's very, very sharp,
p149
aVand I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit.
p150
aVThis is really my flesh. This is not
p151
aVDamian's special-grown flesh.
p152
aVThat's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect.
p153
aVI'm going to pierce my skin
p154
aVand run this needle through to the other side.
p155
aa(lp156
VIf you're queasy \u2014 (Laughs)
p157
aVif you faint easily \u2014 I was doing this for some friends
p158
aVin the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know,
p159
aVand one woman almost passed out.
p160
aVSo, I suggest if you get queasy easy
p161
aVthat you look away for about the next 30 \u2014
p162
aVin fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it.
p163
aVYou'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo, here is what happens, right here,
p166
aVthe beginning of my flesh
p167
aVat the lower part of my arm I just make
p168
aVa little pierce.
p169
aVI'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out?
p170
aVOK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit,
p171
aVand then out the other side like this.
p172
aVNow, essentially we're in the same position we were in
p173
aVwith the knife trick.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVSort of.
p176
aVBut you can't count my fingers right now can you?
p177
aVSo, let me show them to you. That's one, two
p178
aVthree, four, five.
p179
aVYes, well...
p180
aa(lp181
VI know what people think when they see this.
p182
aVThey go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough
p183
aVto stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes.
p184
aVSo, let me give you a little peek.
p185
aVHow's that look out there? Pretty good.
p186
aV(Laughs)
p187
aVYeah, I know. (Laughs)
p188
aVAnd the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that."
p189
aVPeople in the satellite room are starting to move in now.
p190
aVLet me give you good close look at this.
p191
aVThat really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect.
p192
aVThat's my flesh, and I can twist that around.
p193
aVI'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away,
p194
aVdon't look at the thing.
p195
aa(lp196
VPeople in the back or people on video years from now watching this
p197
aVwill go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat
p198
aVin some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be \u2014
p199
aVsee there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding.
p200
aVWell let me work up some blood for you.
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aVYes, there it is.
p203
aV(Applause)
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VNormally now, I would take the needle out.
p207
aVI would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds.
p208
aVBut I think in this context
p209
aVand with the idea of taking something fake
p210
aVand making it into something real,
p211
aVI'm just going to leave it there,
p212
aVand walk off the stage.
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aVI will be seeing you several times over the next few days.
p215
aVI hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.
p216

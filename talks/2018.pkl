VIt was less than a year after September 11,
p5
aVand I was at the Chicago Tribune
p6
aVwriting about shootings and murders,
p7
aVand it was leaving me feeling
p8
aVpretty dark and depressed.
p9
aVI had done some activism in college,
p10
aVso I decided to help a local group
p11
aVhang door knockers against animal testing.
p12
aVI thought it would be a safe way
p13
aVto do something positive,
p14
aVbut of course I have the absolute worst luck ever,
p15
aVand we were all arrested.
p16
aVPolice took this blurry photo of me
p17
aVholding leaflets as evidence.
p18
aa(lp19
VMy charges were dismissed,
p20
aVbut a few weeks later,
p21
aVtwo FBI agents knocked on my door,
p22
aVand they told me that unless I helped them
p23
aVby spying on protest groups,
p24
aVthey would put me on a domestic terrorist list.
p25
aVI'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch,
p26
aVbut I was terrified,
p27
aVand when my fear subsided,
p28
aVI became obsessed with finding out
p29
aVhow this happened,
p30
aVhow animal rights and environmental activists
p31
aVwho have never injured anyone
p32
aVcould become the FBI's number one
p33
aVdomestic terrorism threat.
p34
aa(lp35
VA few years later, I was invited to testify
p36
aVbefore Congress about my reporting,
p37
aVand I told lawmakers that, while everybody
p38
aVis talking about going green,
p39
aVsome people are risking their lives
p40
aVto defend forests and to stop oil pipelines.
p41
aVThey're physically putting their bodies on the line
p42
aVbetween the whalers' harpoons and the whales.
p43
aVThese are everyday people,
p44
aVlike these protesters in Italy
p45
aVwho spontaneously climbed over
p46
aVbarbed wire fences to rescue beagles
p47
aVfrom animal testing.
p48
aVAnd these movements have been incredibly effective
p49
aVand popular,
p50
aVso in 1985, their opponents made up a new word,
p51
aVeco-terrorist,
p52
aVto shift how we view them.
p53
aVThey just made it up.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow these companies have backed new laws
p56
aVlike the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act,
p57
aVwhich turns activism into terrorism
p58
aVif it causes a loss of profits.
p59
aVNow most people never even heard about this law,
p60
aVincluding members of Congress.
p61
aVLess than one percent were in the room
p62
aVwhen it passed the House.
p63
aVThe rest were outside at a new memorial.
p64
aVThey were praising Dr. King
p65
aVas his style of activism was branded as terrorism
p66
aVif done in the name of animals or the environment.
p67
aa(lp68
VSupporters say laws like this are needed
p69
aVfor the extremists:
p70
aVthe vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.
p71
aVBut right now, companies like TransCanada
p72
aVare briefing police in presentations like this one
p73
aVabout how to prosecute nonviolent protesters
p74
aVas terrorists.
p75
aVThe FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism
p76
aVare not about violence,
p77
aVthey're about public relations.
p78
aVToday, in multiple countries,
p79
aVcorporations are pushing new laws
p80
aVthat make it illegal to photograph
p81
aVanimal cruelty on their farms.
p82
aVThe latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago,
p83
aVand today we released a lawsuit
p84
aVchallenging it as unconstitutional
p85
aVas a threat to journalism.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe first of these ag-gag prosecutions,
p88
aVas they're called,
p89
aVwas a young woman named Amy Meyer,
p90
aVand Amy saw a sick cow being moved
p91
aVby a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse
p92
aVas she was on the public street.
p93
aVAnd Amy did what any of us would:
p94
aVShe filmed it.
p95
aVWhen I found out about her story, I wrote about it,
p96
aVand within 24 hours, it created such an uproar
p97
aVthat the prosecutors just dropped all the charges.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut apparently, even exposing stuff like that
p100
aVis a threat.
p101
aVThrough the Freedom of Information Act,
p102
aVI learned that the counter-terrorism unit
p103
aVhas been monitoring my articles
p104
aVand speeches like this one.
p105
aVThey even included this nice little write-up of my book.
p106
aVThey described it as "compelling and well-written."
p107
aV(Applause)
p108
aVBlurb on the next book, right?
p109
aa(lp110
VThe point of all of this is to make us afraid,
p111
aVbut as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith
p112
aVin the power of education.
p113
aVOur best weapon is sunlight.
p114
aa(lp115
VDostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man
p116
aVis to prove he's a man and not a piano key.
p117
aVOver and over throughout history,
p118
aVpeople in power have used fear
p119
aVto silence the truth and to silence dissent.
p120
aVIt's time we strike a new note.
p121
aa(lp122
VThank you.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Applause)

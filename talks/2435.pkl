VAll right, I want to see a show of hands:
p5
aVhow many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook
p6
aVbecause they said something offensive about politics or religion,
p7
aVchildcare, food?
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd how many of you know at least one person that you avoid
p12
aVbecause you just don't want to talk to them?
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VYou know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation,
p17
aVwe just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady":
p18
aVStick to the weather and your health.
p19
aVBut these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects \u2014
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
Vare not safe either.
p24
aVSo this world that we live in,
p25
aVthis world in which every conversation
p26
aVhas the potential to devolve into an argument,
p27
aVwhere our politicians can't speak to one another
p28
aVand where even the most trivial of issues
p29
aVhave someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal.
p30
aVPew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults,
p31
aVand they found that at this moment, we are more polarized,
p32
aVwe are more divided,
p33
aVthan we ever have been in history.
p34
aVWe're less likely to compromise,
p35
aVwhich means we're not listening to each other.
p36
aVAnd we make decisions about where to live,
p37
aVwho to marry and even who our friends are going to be,
p38
aVbased on what we already believe.
p39
aVAgain, that means we're not listening to each other.
p40
aVA conversation requires a balance between talking and listening,
p41
aVand somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, part of that is due to technology.
p44
aVThe smartphones that you all either have in your hands
p45
aVor close enough that you could grab them really quickly.
p46
aVAccording to Pew Research,
p47
aVabout a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day.
p48
aVAnd many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends
p49
aVthan they are to talk to them face to face.
p50
aVThere's this great piece in The Atlantic.
p51
aVIt was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
p52
aVAnd he gave his kids a communication project.
p53
aVHe wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes.
p54
aVAnd he said this: "I came to realize..."
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
V"I came to realize that conversational competence
p59
aVmight be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach.
p60
aVKids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens,
p61
aVbut rarely do they have an opportunity
p62
aVto hone their interpersonal communications skills.
p63
aVIt might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves:
p64
aVIs there any 21st-century skill
p65
aVmore important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, I make my living talking to people:
p68
aVNobel Prize winners, truck drivers,
p69
aVbillionaires, kindergarten teachers,
p70
aVheads of state, plumbers.
p71
aVI talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like.
p72
aVI talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level.
p73
aVBut I still have a great conversation with them.
p74
aVSo I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk
p75
aVand how to listen.
p76
aa(lp77
VMany of you have already heard a lot of advice on this,
p78
aVthings like look the person in the eye,
p79
aVthink of interesting topics to discuss in advance,
p80
aVlook, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention,
p81
aVrepeat back what you just heard or summarize it.
p82
aVSo I want you to forget all of that.
p83
aVIt is crap.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VThere is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention
p88
aVif you are in fact paying attention.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
V(Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer
p95
aVthat I do in regular life.
p96
aVSo, I'm going to teach you how to interview people,
p97
aVand that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists.
p98
aVLearn to have a conversation
p99
aVwithout wasting your time, without getting bored,
p100
aVand, please God, without offending anybody.
p101
aa(lp102
VWe've all had really great conversations.
p103
aVWe've had them before. We know what it's like.
p104
aVThe kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired,
p105
aVor where you feel like you've made a real connection
p106
aVor you've been perfectly understood.
p107
aVThere is no reason
p108
aVwhy most of your interactions can't be like that.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them,
p111
aVbut honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it,
p112
aVyou'll already enjoy better conversations.
p113
aa(lp114
VNumber one: Don't multitask.
p115
aVAnd I don't mean just set down your cell phone
p116
aVor your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand.
p117
aVI mean, be present.
p118
aVBe in that moment.
p119
aVDon't think about your argument you had with your boss.
p120
aVDon't think about what you're going to have for dinner.
p121
aVIf you want to get out of the conversation,
p122
aVget out of the conversation,
p123
aVbut don't be half in it and half out of it.
p124
aa(lp125
VNumber two: Don't pontificate.
p126
aVIf you want to state your opinion
p127
aVwithout any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth,
p128
aVwrite a blog.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show:
p133
aVBecause they're really boring.
p134
aVIf they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.
p135
aVIf they're liberal, they're going to hate
p136
aVbig banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney.
p137
aVTotally predictable.
p138
aVAnd you don't want to be like that.
p139
aVYou need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.
p140
aVThe famed therapist M. Scott Peck said
p141
aVthat true listening requires a setting aside of oneself.
p142
aVAnd sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion.
p143
aVHe said that sensing this acceptance,
p144
aVthe speaker will become less and less vulnerable
p145
aVand more and more likely to open up the inner recesses
p146
aVof his or her mind to the listener.
p147
aVAgain, assume that you have something to learn.
p148
aa(lp149
VBill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't."
p150
aVI put it this way:
p151
aVEverybody is an expert in something.
p152
aa(lp153
VNumber three: Use open-ended questions.
p154
aVIn this case, take a cue from journalists.
p155
aVStart your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
p156
aVIf you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out.
p157
aVIf I ask you, "Were you terrified?"
p158
aVyou're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence,
p159
aVwhich is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."
p160
aV"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
p161
aVLet them describe it. They're the ones that know.
p162
aVTry asking them things like, "What was that like?"
p163
aV"How did that feel?"
p164
aVBecause then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it,
p165
aVand you're going to get a much more interesting response.
p166
aa(lp167
VNumber four: Go with the flow.
p168
aVThat means thoughts will come into your mind
p169
aVand you need to let them go out of your mind.
p170
aVWe've heard interviews often
p171
aVin which a guest is talking for several minutes
p172
aVand then the host comes back in and asks a question
p173
aVwhich seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered.
p174
aVThat means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago
p175
aVbecause he thought of this really clever question,
p176
aVand he was just bound and determined to say that.
p177
aVAnd we do the exact same thing.
p178
aVWe're sitting there having a conversation with someone,
p179
aVand then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd we stop listening.
p184
aVStories and ideas are going to come to you.
p185
aVYou need to let them come and let them go.
p186
aa(lp187
VNumber five: If you don't know, say that you don't know.
p188
aVNow, people on the radio, especially on NPR,
p189
aVare much more aware that they're going on the record,
p190
aVand so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in
p191
aVand what they claim to know for sure.
p192
aVDo that. Err on the side of caution.
p193
aVTalk should not be cheap.
p194
aa(lp195
VNumber six: Don't equate your experience with theirs.
p196
aVIf they're talking about having lost a family member,
p197
aVdon't start talking about the time you lost a family member.
p198
aVIf they're talking about the trouble they're having at work,
p199
aVdon't tell them about how much you hate your job.
p200
aVIt's not the same. It is never the same.
p201
aVAll experiences are individual.
p202
aVAnd, more importantly, it is not about you.
p203
aVYou don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are
p204
aVor how much you've suffered.
p205
aVSomebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said,
p206
aV"I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers."
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VConversations are not a promotional opportunity.
p211
aa(lp212
VNumber seven:
p213
aVTry not to repeat yourself.
p214
aVIt's condescending, and it's really boring,
p215
aVand we tend to do it a lot.
p216
aVEspecially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids,
p217
aVwe have a point to make,
p218
aVso we just keep rephrasing it over and over.
p219
aVDon't do that.
p220
aa(lp221
VNumber eight: Stay out of the weeds.
p222
aVFrankly, people don't care
p223
aVabout the years, the names,
p224
aVthe dates, all those details
p225
aVthat you're struggling to come up with in your mind.
p226
aVThey don't care. What they care about is you.
p227
aVThey care about what you're like,
p228
aVwhat you have in common.
p229
aVSo forget the details. Leave them out.
p230
aa(lp231
VNumber nine:
p232
aVThis is not the last one, but it is the most important one.
p233
aVListen.
p234
aVI cannot tell you how many really important people have said
p235
aVthat listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill
p236
aVthat you could develop.
p237
aVBuddha said, and I'm paraphrasing,
p238
aV"If your mouth is open, you're not learning."
p239
aVAnd Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job."
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VWhy do we not listen to each other?
p244
aVNumber one, we'd rather talk.
p245
aVWhen I'm talking, I'm in control.
p246
aVI don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in.
p247
aVI'm the center of attention.
p248
aVI can bolster my own identity.
p249
aVBut there's another reason:
p250
aVWe get distracted.
p251
aVThe average person talks at about 225 word per minute,
p252
aVbut we can listen at up to 500 words per minute.
p253
aVSo our minds are filling in those other 275 words.
p254
aVAnd look, I know, it takes effort and energy
p255
aVto actually pay attention to someone,
p256
aVbut if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation.
p257
aVYou're just two people shouting out barely related sentences
p258
aVin the same place.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VYou have to listen to one another.
p263
aVStephen Covey said it very beautifully.
p264
aVHe said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand.
p265
aVWe listen with the intent to reply."
p266
aa(lp267
VOne more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief.
p268
aa(lp269
V[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest,
p270
aVbut long enough to cover the subject. \u2014 My Sister]
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
V(Applause)
p275
aVAll of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one:
p276
aVBe interested in other people.
p277
aa(lp278
VYou know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather,
p279
aVand there was kind of a ritual in my home.
p280
aVPeople would come over to talk to my grandparents,
p281
aVand after they would leave, my mother would come over to us,
p282
aVand she'd say, "Do you know who that was?
p283
aVShe was the runner-up to Miss America.
p284
aVHe was the mayor of Sacramento.
p285
aVShe won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer."
p286
aVAnd I kind of grew up assuming
p287
aVeveryone has some hidden, amazing thing about them.
p288
aVAnd honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host.
p289
aVI keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can,
p290
aVI keep my mind open,
p291
aVand I'm always prepared to be amazed,
p292
aVand I'm never disappointed.
p293
aa(lp294
VYou do the same thing.
p295
aVGo out, talk to people,
p296
aVlisten to people,
p297
aVand, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.
p298
aa(lp299
VThanks.

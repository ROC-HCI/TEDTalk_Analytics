VIn 1962, with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring,"
p5
aVI think for people like me in the world of the making of things,
p6
aVthe canary in the mine wasn't singing.
p7
aVAnd so the question that we might not have birds
p8
aVbecame kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around
p9
aVlooking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared.
p10
aVAnd the question was, were the birds singing?
p11
aVNow, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear.
p12
aVBut, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be.
p13
aVWhat is a bird?
p14
aVWell, in my world, this is a rubber duck.
p15
aVIt comes in California with a warning \u2014
p16
aV"This product contains chemicals known by the State of California
p17
aVto cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."
p18
aVThis is a bird.
p19
aVWhat kind of culture would produce a product of this kind
p20
aVand then label it and sell it to children?
p21
aVI think we have a design problem.
p22
aa(lp23
VSomeone heard the six hours of talk that I gave
p24
aVcalled "The Monticello Dialogues" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note \u2014
p25
aV"We realize that design is a signal of intention,
p26
aVbut it also has to occur within a world,
p27
aVand we have to understand that world in order to
p28
aVimbue our designs with inherent intelligence,
p29
aVand so as we look back at the basic state of affairs
p30
aVin which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition
p31
aVto understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet,
p32
aVand I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there,
p33
aVbecause the news is the news of abundance,
p34
aVand not the news of limits,
p35
aVand I think as our culture tortures itself now
p36
aVwith tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear,
p37
aVwe can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent,
p38
aVdriven by the sun, and start to imagine
p39
aVwhat that would be like to share."
p40
aVThat was a nice thing to get.
p41
aVThat was one sentence.
p42
aVHenry James would be proud.
p43
aVThis is \u2014 I put it down at the bottom,
p44
aVbut that was extemporaneous, obviously.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe fundamental issue is that, for me,
p47
aVdesign is the first signal of human intentions.
p48
aVSo what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be \u2014
p49
aVif we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world \u2014
p50
aVwell, what would our intention be as a species
p51
aVnow that we're the dominant species?
p52
aVAnd it's not just stewardship and dominion debate,
p53
aVbecause really, dominion is implicit in stewardship \u2014
p54
aVbecause how could you dominate something you had killed?
p55
aVAnd stewardship's implicit in dominion,
p56
aVbecause you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo the question is, what is the first question for designers?
p59
aVNow, as guardians \u2014 let's say the state, for example,
p60
aVwhich reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on \u2014
p61
aVthe question we're asking the guardian at this point is
p62
aVare we meant, how are we meant,
p63
aVto secure local societies, create world peace
p64
aVand save the environment?
p65
aVBut I don't know that that's the common debate.
p66
aa(lp67
VCommerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick,
p68
aVessentially creative, highly effective and efficient,
p69
aVand fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange
p70
aVvalue for very long if we don't trust each other.
p71
aVSo we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work,
p72
aVbut the question we bring to it is,
p73
aVhow do we love all the children of all species for all time?
p74
aVAnd so we start our designs with that question.
p75
aVBecause what we realize today is that modern culture
p76
aVappears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy.
p77
aVIf we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intend
p78
aVto cause global warming on the way here,"
p79
aVand we say, "That's not part of my plan,"
p80
aVthen we realize it's part of our de facto plan.
p81
aVBecause it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd I was at the White House for President Bush,
p84
aVmeeting with every federal department and agency,
p85
aVand I pointed out that they appear to have no plan.
p86
aVIf the end game is global warming, they're doing great.
p87
aVIf the end game is mercury toxification of our children
p88
aVdownwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act,
p89
aVthen I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as,
p90
aV"Brain death for all children. No child left behind."
p91
aa(lp92
V(Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VSo, the question is, how many federal officials
p95
aVare ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families?
p96
aVSo if you don't have an endgame of something delightful,
p97
aVthen you're just moving chess pieces around,
p98
aVif you don't know you're taking the king.
p99
aVSo perhaps we could develop a strategy of change,
p100
aVwhich requires humility. And in my business as an architect,
p101
aVit's unfortunate the word "humility" and the word "architect"
p102
aVhave not appeared in the same paragraph since "The Fountainhead."
p103
aVSo if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility,
p104
aVreflect on this \u2014 it took us 5,000 years
p105
aVto put wheels on our luggage.
p106
aVSo, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame.
p107
aVThere is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.
p108
aVAnd so we call it "cradle to cradle,"
p109
aVand our goal is very simple.
p110
aa(lp111
VThis is what I presented to the White House.
p112
aVOur goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world,
p113
aVwith clean air, clean water, soil and power \u2014
p114
aVeconomically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VWhat don't you like about this?
p119
aVWhich part of this don't you like?
p120
aVSo we realized we want full diversity,
p121
aVeven though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said
p122
aVwhen asked what it was like to be President of France.
p123
aVHe said, "What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?"
p124
aVBut at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo we've designed products
p127
aVand we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million.
p128
aVThis is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition
p129
aVinstead of Alzheimer's later in life.
p130
aVWe can ask ourselves, what is justice,
p131
aVand is justice blind, or is justice blindness?
p132
aVAnd at what point did that uniform turn from white to black?
p133
aVWater has been declared a human right by the United Nations.
p134
aVAir quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes.
p135
aVIs there anybody here who doesn't breathe?
p136
aVClean soil is a critical problem \u2014 the nitrification, the dead zones
p137
aVin the Gulf of Mexico.
p138
aVA fundamental issue that's not being addressed.
p139
aVWe've seen the first form of solar energy
p140
aVthat's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind
p141
aVhere in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving.
p142
aVAnd if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC,
p143
aVthey asked him, "When will we see the end of the age of oil?"
p144
aVI don't know if you remember his answer, but it was,
p145
aV"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones."
p146
aVWe see that companies acting ethically in this world
p147
aVare outperforming those that don't.
p148
aVWe see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect.
p149
aVThis is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China.
p150
aVThis woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous,
p151
aVrelease four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment,
p152
aVwhich is from copper.
p153
aa(lp154
VOn the other hand, we see great signs of hope.
p155
aVHere's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out
p156
aVhow to do mass-produced health.
p157
aVHe has given eyesight to two million people for free.
p158
aVWe see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again
p159
aVbecause of the contaminants of the coatings \u2014
p160
aVbismuth, antimony, copper and so on.
p161
aVThey become building steel.
p162
aVOn the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway,
p163
aVWarren Buffett and Shaw Carpet,
p164
aVthe largest carpet company in the world.
p165
aVWe've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable,
p166
aVdown to the parts per million.
p167
aVThe upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam,
p168
aVthe bottom, a polyolephine \u2014 infinitely recyclable thermoplastic.
p169
aVNow if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability.
p170
aVThe building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gap
p171
aVwith an ancient meadow, is an asset \u2014 its nesting grounds.
p172
aa(lp173
VHere's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong,
p174
aVwith six million people in 40 square miles.
p175
aVDuring the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day.
p176
aVAnd the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been
p177
aVfarming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries.
p178
aVYou can't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries
p179
aVwithout understanding nutrient flow.
p180
aVMy childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington,
p181
aVamong the first growth and big growth.
p182
aVMy grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics,
p183
aVso I have a lot of tree karma I am working off.
p184
aVI went to Yale for graduate school,
p185
aVstudied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier,
p186
aVaffectionately known in our business as Brutalism.
p187
aVIf we look at the world of architecture,
p188
aVwe see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin,
p189
aVthe question might be, "Well, where's the sun?"
p190
aVAnd this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston,
p191
aVand the windows are all closed. And with most products
p192
aVappearing not to have been designed for indoor use,
p193
aVthis is actually a vertical gas chamber.
p194
aa(lp195
VWhen I went to Yale, we had the first energy crisis,
p196
aVand I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland
p197
aVas a student, which I then built \u2014
p198
aVwhich would give you a sense of my ambition.
p199
aVAnd Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers,
p200
aVkept coming over to my desk to give me criticism,
p201
aVand he would say, "Bill, you've got to understand- \u2014
p202
aVsolar energy has nothing to do with architecture."
p203
aVI guess he didn't read Vitruvius.
p204
aVIn 1984, we did the first so-called "green office" in America
p205
aVfor Environmental Defense.
p206
aVWe started asking manufacturers what were in their materials.
p207
aVThey said, "They're proprietary, they're legal, go away."
p208
aVThe only indoor quality work done in this country at that time
p209
aVwas sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
p210
aVand it was to prove there was no danger
p211
aVfrom secondhand smoke in the workplace.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo, all of a sudden, here I am, graduating from high school in 1969,
p214
aVand this happens, and we realize that "away" went away.
p215
aVRemember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away?
p216
aVAnd yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example \u2014
p217
aVyou see that little blue thing above Hawaii?
p218
aVThat's the Pacific Gyre.
p219
aVIt was recently dragged for plankton by scientists,
p220
aVand they found six times as much plastic as plankton.
p221
aVWhen asked, they said, "It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush."
p222
aVPerhaps that's away.
p223
aVSo we're looking for the design rules of this \u2014
p224
aVthis is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world, Irian Jaya,
p225
aV259 species of tree, and we described this
p226
aVin the book, "Cradle to Cradle."
p227
aVThe book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree.
p228
aVThat's the name of the first chapter \u2014 "This Book is Not a Tree."
p229
aVBecause in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out,
p230
aV"we write our history on the skin of fish
p231
aVwith the blood of bears."
p232
aVAnd with so much polymer, what we really need
p233
aVis technical nutrition, and to use something
p234
aVas elegant as a tree \u2014 imagine this design assignment:
p235
aVDesign something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon,
p236
aVfixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel,
p237
aVmakes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates,
p238
aVchanges colors with the seasons and self-replicates.
p239
aVWell, why don't we knock that down and write on it?
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VSo, we're looking at the same criteria
p244
aVas most people \u2014 you know, can I afford it?
p245
aVDoes it work? Do I like it?
p246
aVWe're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville,
p247
aVwhere I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson.
p248
aVWe're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
p249
aVNow if we look at the word "competition,"
p250
aVI'm sure most of you've used it.
p251
aVYou know, most people don't realize it comes from
p252
aVthe Latin competere, which means strive together.
p253
aVIt means the way Olympic athletes train with each other.
p254
aVThey get fit together, and then they compete.
p255
aVThe Williams sisters compete \u2014 one wins Wimbledon.
p256
aVSo we've been looking at the idea of competition
p257
aVas a way of cooperating in order to get fit together.
p258
aVAnd the Chinese government has now \u2014
p259
aVI work with the Chinese government now \u2014
p260
aVhas taken this up.
p261
aVWe're also looking at survival of the fittest,
p262
aVnot in just competition terms in our modern context
p263
aVof destroy the other or beat them to the ground,
p264
aVbut really to fit together and build niches
p265
aVand have growth that is good.
p266
aa(lp267
VNow most environmentalists don't say growth is good,
p268
aVbecause, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame.
p269
aVBut if we look at asphalt as our growth,
p270
aVthen we realize that all we're doing is destroying
p271
aVthe planetary's fundamental underlying operating system.
p272
aVSo when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective,
p273
aVwe see energy as physics, chemistry as mass,
p274
aVand all of a sudden, you get this biology.
p275
aVAnd we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem,
p276
aVbut the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through
p277
aVall these toxic materials that we disgorge,
p278
aVwe will never be able to recover that.
p279
aVAnd as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years
p280
aVafter discovering DNA with Mr. Watson,
p281
aVthat life itself has to have growth as a precondition \u2014
p282
aVit has to have free energy, sunlight
p283
aVand it needs to be an open system of chemicals.
p284
aVSo we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing,
p285
aVand we want growth, we want free energy from sunlight
p286
aVand we want an open metabolism for chemicals.
p287
aVThen, the question becomes not growth or no growth,
p288
aVbut what do you want to grow?
p289
aVSo instead of just growing destruction,
p290
aVwe want to grow the things that we might enjoy,
p291
aVand someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo therefore, we have these two metabolisms,
p294
aVand I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart,
p295
aVand we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms.
p296
aVThe biological one I'm sure you understand,
p297
aVbut also the technical one, where we take materials
p298
aVand put them into closed cycles.
p299
aVWe call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition.
p300
aVTechnical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition.
p301
aVBiological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans,
p302
aVwhich means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton,
p303
aVthe world would run out of cork and dry up.
p304
aVSo we need materials in closed cycles,
p305
aVbut we need to analyze them down to the parts per million
p306
aVfor cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects,
p307
aVdisruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence,
p308
aVheavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them
p309
aVand their production and so on.
p310
aa(lp311
VOur first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals
p312
aVin the textile industry.
p313
aVUsing those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.]
p314
aVWe were left with 38 chemicals.
p315
aVWe have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals
p316
aVin human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks.
p317
aVSo designers all over the world can analyze their products
p318
aVdown to the parts per million for human and ecological health.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Applause)
p321
aa(lp322
VWe've developed a protocol so that companies can send
p323
aVthese same messages all the way through their supply chains,
p324
aVbecause when we asked most companies we work with \u2014 about a trillion dollars
p325
aV\u2014 and say, "Where does your stuff come from?" They say, "Suppliers."
p326
aV"And where does it go?"
p327
aV"Customers."
p328
aVSo we need some help there.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo the biological nutrients, the first fabrics \u2014
p331
aVthe water coming out was clean enough to drink.
p332
aVTechnical nutrients \u2014 this is for Shaw Carpet, infinitely reusable carpet.
p333
aVHere's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet.
p334
aVBiotechnical nutrients \u2014 the Model U for Ford Motor,
p335
aVa cradle to cradle car \u2014 concept car.
p336
aVShoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable,
p337
aVthe bottoms are biodegradable soles.
p338
aVWear your old shoes in, your new shoes out.
p339
aVThere is no finish line.
p340
aVThe idea here of the car is that some of the materials
p341
aVgo back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil \u2014
p342
aVit's all solar-powered.
p343
aa(lp344
VHere's a building at Oberlin College we designed
p345
aVthat makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water.
p346
aVHere's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grasses
p347
aVof San Bruno, California, are on the roof.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd this is our project for Ford Motor Company.
p350
aVIt's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn.
p351
aVThis is obviously a color photograph.
p352
aVThese are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford.
p353
aVWe saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one,
p354
aVwhich is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus
p355
aVat a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars.
p356
aVHere it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres.
p357
aVThis is the roof, saving money,
p358
aVand this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer.
p359
aVThey showed up in five days.
p360
aVAnd we now have 350-pound auto workers
p361
aVlearning bird songs on the Internet.
p362
aVWe're developing now protocols for cities \u2014
p363
aVthat's the home of technical nutrients.
p364
aVThe country \u2014 the home of biological. And putting them together.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd so I will finish by showing you a new city
p367
aVwe're designing for the Chinese government.
p368
aVWe're doing 12 cities for China right now,
p369
aVbased on cradle to cradle as templates.
p370
aVOur assignment is to develop protocols for the housing
p371
aVfor 400 million people in 12 years.
p372
aVWe did a mass energy balance \u2014 if they use brick,
p373
aVthey will lose all their soil and burn all their coal.
p374
aVThey'll have cities with no energy and no food.
p375
aVWe signed a Memorandum of Understanding \u2014
p376
aVhere's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter \u2014
p377
aVfor China to adopt cradle to cradle.
p378
aVBecause if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer,
p379
aVsend it to the lowest-cost distribution \u2014 Wal-Mart \u2014
p380
aVand then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is that
p381
aVwe have what, effectively, when I was a student,
p382
aVwas called mutually assured destruction.
p383
aa(lp384
VNow we do it by molecule. These are our cities.
p385
aVWe're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape.
p386
aVThis is the site.
p387
aVWe don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built,
p388
aVso they brought us in to intercede.
p389
aVThis is their plan.
p390
aVIt's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape.
p391
aVAnd they brought us in and said, "What would you do?"
p392
aVThis is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph.
p393
aVSo this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now,
p394
aVand here's our proposal.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Applause)
p397
aa(lp398
VSo the way we approached this
p399
aVis we studied the hydrology very carefully.
p400
aVWe studied the biota, the ancient biota,
p401
aVthe current farming and the protocols.
p402
aVWe studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city
p403
aVwill have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlight
p404
aVin every single apartment at some point during the day.
p405
aVWe then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure.
p406
aVWe lay out the building areas.
p407
aVWe start to integrate commercial and mixed use
p408
aVso the people all have centers and places to be.
p409
aVThe transportation is all very simple,
p410
aVeverybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility.
p411
aVWe have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive.
p412
aVThe waste systems all connect.
p413
aVIf you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants,
p414
aVwhich are sold as assets, not liabilities.
p415
aVBecause who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas?
p416
aVThe waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations.
p417
aVAnd then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city
p418
aVto power the fuel for the cooking for the city.
p419
aVSo this is \u2014 these are fertilizer gas plants.
p420
aVAnd then the compost is all taken back
p421
aVto the roofs of the city, where we've got farming,
p422
aVbecause what we've done is lifted up the city,
p423
aVthe landscape, into the air to \u2014 to restore the native landscape
p424
aVon the roofs of the buildings.
p425
aVThe solar power of all the factory centers
p426
aVand all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city.
p427
aa(lp428
VAnd this is the concept for the top of the city.
p429
aVWe've lifted the earth up onto the roofs.
p430
aVThe farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next.
p431
aVWe inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors.
p432
aVAnd so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.

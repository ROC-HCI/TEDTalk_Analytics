VSo I work in marketing, which I love,
p5
aVbut my first passion was physics,
p6
aVa passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,
p7
aVwhen I had a little less gray hair.
p8
aVSo he taught me
p9
aVthat physics is cool
p10
aVbecause it teaches us so much about the world around us.
p11
aVAnd I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you
p12
aVthat physics can teach us something about marketing.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo quick show of hands \u2014
p15
aVwho studied some marketing in university?
p16
aVWho studied some physics in university?
p17
aVPretty good. And at school?
p18
aVOkay, lots of you.
p19
aVSo, hopefully this will bring back some happy,
p20
aVor possibly some slightly disturbing memories.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, physics and marketing.
p23
aVWe'll start with something very simple \u2014 Newton's Law:
p24
aV"The force equals mass times acceleration."
p25
aVThis is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines
p26
aVshould have studied a bit more carefully
p27
aVbefore they ran this campaign.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVBut if we rearrange this formula quickly,
p30
aVwe can get to acceleration equals force over mass,
p31
aVwhich means
p32
aVthat for a larger particle \u2014 a larger mass \u2014
p33
aVit requires more force to change its direction.
p34
aVIt's the same with brands:
p35
aVthe more massive a brand, the more baggage it has,
p36
aVthe more force is needed to change its positioning.
p37
aVAnd that's one of the reasons why
p38
aVArthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture
p39
aVrather than try to persuade the world
p40
aVthat Andersen's could stand for something
p41
aVother than accountancy.
p42
aVIt explains why Hoover
p43
aVfound it very difficult to persuade the world
p44
aVthat it was more than vacuum cleaners,
p45
aVand why companies like Unilever and P&G
p46
aVkeep brands separate,
p47
aVlike Ariel and Pringles and Dove
p48
aVrather than having one giant parent brand.
p49
aVSo the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object
p50
aVthe more force is needed
p51
aVto change its direction.
p52
aVThe marketing is, the bigger a brand,
p53
aVthe more difficult it is to reposition it.
p54
aVSo think about a portfolio of brands
p55
aVor maybe new brands for new ventures.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?
p58
aVGetting a little more technical now.
p59
aVSo this says that
p60
aVit's impossible, by definition,
p61
aVto measure exactly the state \u2014 i.e., the position \u2014
p62
aVand the momentum of a particle,
p63
aVbecause the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
p64
aVSo to explain that \u2014 if you've got an elementary particle
p65
aVand you shine a light on it,
p66
aVthen the photon of light has momentum,
p67
aVwhich knocks the particle,
p68
aVso you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
p69
aVBy measuring it,
p70
aVthe act of measurement changes it.
p71
aVThe act of observation changes it.
p72
aVIt's the same in marketing.
p73
aVSo with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.
p74
aVThink about the group of moms
p75
aVwho are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group,
p76
aVand almost none of them buy lots of junk food.
p77
aVAnd yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.
p78
aVThink about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets,
p79
aVwho stuff their trolleys
p80
aVfull of fresh green vegetables and fruit,
p81
aVbut don't shop like that any other day.
p82
aVAnd if you think about the number of people
p83
aVwho claim in surveys
p84
aVto regularly look for porn on the Web,
p85
aVit's very few.
p86
aVYet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.
p87
aVSo luckily, the science \u2014
p88
aVno, sorry \u2014 the marketing is getting easier.
p89
aVLuckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking,
p90
aVmore digital media consumption,
p91
aVyou can measure more what consumers actually do,
p92
aVrather than what they say they do.
p93
aVSo the physics is
p94
aVyou can never accurately and exactly
p95
aVmeasure a particle,
p96
aVbecause the observation changes it.
p97
aVThe marketing is \u2014 the message for marketing is \u2014
p98
aVthat try to measure what consumers actually do,
p99
aVrather than what they say they'll do
p100
aVor anticipate they'll do.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo next, the scientific method \u2014
p103
aVan axiom of physics, of all science \u2014
p104
aVsays you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation,
p105
aVyou can only disprove it.
p106
aVWhat this means is you can gather more and more data
p107
aVaround a hypothesis or a positioning,
p108
aVand it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.
p109
aVAnd only one contrary data point
p110
aVcan blow your theory out of the water.
p111
aVSo if we take an example \u2014
p112
aVPtolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory
p113
aVthat the planets would rotate around the Earth.
p114
aVIt only took one robust observation from Copernicus
p115
aVto blow that idea out of the water.
p116
aVAnd there are parallels for marketing \u2014
p117
aVyou can invest for a long time in a brand,
p118
aVbut a single contrary observation of that positioning
p119
aVwill destroy consumers' belief.
p120
aVTake BP \u2014
p121
aVthey spent millions of pounds over many years
p122
aVbuilding up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand,
p123
aVbut then one little accident.
p124
aVThink about Toyota.
p125
aVIt was, for a long time, revered
p126
aVas the most reliable of cars,
p127
aVand then they had the big recall incident.
p128
aVAnd Tiger Woods, for a long time,
p129
aVthe perfect brand ambassador.
p130
aVWell, you know the story.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVSo the physics is
p133
aVthat you cannot prove a hypothesis,
p134
aVbut it's easy to disprove it \u2014
p135
aVany hypothesis is shaky.
p136
aVAnd the marketing is
p137
aVthat not matter how much you've invested in your brand,
p138
aVone bad week can undermine decades of good work.
p139
aVSo be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups
p140
aVthat can undermine your brand.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy \u2014
p143
aVthe second law of thermodynamics.
p144
aVThis says that entropy,
p145
aVwhich is a measure of the disorder of a system,
p146
aVwill always increase.
p147
aVThe same is true of marketing.
p148
aVIf we go back 20 years,
p149
aVthe one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager
p150
aVcould pretty much define a brand.
p151
aVBut where we are today, things have changed.
p152
aVYou can get a strong brand image
p153
aVor a message
p154
aVand put it out there like the Conservative Party did
p155
aVearlier this year with their election poster.
p156
aVBut then you lose control of it.
p157
aVWith the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools
p158
aVthat are available now to every consumer,
p159
aVit's impossible to control where it goes.
p160
aVYour brand starts being dispersed,
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVit gets more chaotic.
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVIt's out of your control.
p165
aV(Laughter)
p166
aVI actually saw him speak \u2014 he did a good job.
p167
aVBut while this may be unsettling for marketers,
p168
aVit's actually a good thing.
p169
aVThis distribution of brand energy
p170
aVgets your brand closer to the people,
p171
aVmore in with the people.
p172
aVIt makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force,
p173
aVwhich is ultimately good for your brand.
p174
aVSo, the lesson from physics is
p175
aVthat entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.
p176
aVThe message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.
p177
aVYou can't fight it, so embrace it
p178
aVand find a way to work with it.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo to close,
p181
aVmy teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me
p182
aVthat physics is cool,
p183
aVand hopefully, I've convinced you
p184
aVthat physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.
p185
aVThank you.

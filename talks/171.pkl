VThree years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made,
p5
aVwith an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.
p6
aVMy idea \u2014 and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night,
p7
aVand we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep \u2014
p8
aVI was excited, with this phone call.
p9
aVI was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets,
p10
aVand I realized I'd gotten to know their stories,
p11
aVand I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
p12
aVto tell a warrior's story as it unfolded.
p13
aVSo I went to bed that night pretty excited.
p14
aVNot sure of all the details, but excited.
p15
aVIt wasn't at four in the morning, but it was closer to midnight.
p16
aVWoke straight up. Wide-awake as could be.
p17
aVAnd I had this idea: what if I could, in effect, virtually embed,
p18
aVand create a permeable relationship with the soldiers?
p19
aVTo tell the story from the inside out, versus the outside in?
p20
aa(lp21
VSo, I called back Major Heilshorn,
p22
aVwho's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard.
p23
aVAnd he knew me, so I was like, "Greg?"
p24
aVHe's like, "Yes, Deborah?"
p25
aVTold him my idea, and you know,
p26
aVhe is one of the bravest men in the world,
p27
aVas is General Blair, who, in the end, gave me permission to try this experiment.
p28
aa(lp29
VWithin 10 days, I was down at Fort Dix.
p30
aVHe gave me my pick of units.
p31
aVI picked one unit \u2014 Charlie Company, Third of the 172nd,
p32
aVthey're mountain infantry \u2014 for two reasons.
p33
aVOne, they're infantry.
p34
aVNumber two, they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda,
p35
aVso I knew they would have Internet access.
p36
aVThe caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer.
p37
aVThis was a big thing that
p38
aVI think when Major H told me,
p39
aVI wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix,
p42
aVI had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.
p43
aVYou can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got.
p44
aVThe opening one was,
p45
aV"What the fuck do you know about the National Guard?"
p46
aVI started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.
p47
aVGave them about a nine minute response,
p48
aVand there we went.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo, I'd like to show the clip of the film.
p51
aVIt's our trailer, because I know, obviously you guys are busy,
p52
aVmany of you may not have had a chance to see it.
p53
aVSo, I want to show the trailer,
p54
aVand then I'm going to take apart one scene in detail.
p55
aVIf we could roll?
p56
aa(lp57
V(Video) Stephen Pink: This is Sergeant Stephen Pink.
p58
aa(lp59
VMichael Moriarty: Specialist Michael Moriarty.
p60
aa(lp61
VZack Bazzi: Do I really want to go? Probably not.
p62
aa(lp63
VSoldier: We're not supposed to talk to the media.
p64
aa(lp65
VSP: I'm not the media, dammit!
p66
aa(lp67
VMM: The day is here. Life will change.
p68
aa(lp69
VVoice: The real deal, man! Narrator: You ready?
p70
aVSoldier: Bring it on! Narrator: You ready? Voice 2: Iraq, here we come!
p71
aa(lp72
VZB: Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat.
p73
aVIt's natural instinct.
p74
aa(lp75
VSP: If you let fear get to you,
p76
aVthen you're not going to be doing your job.
p77
aa(lp78
VMM: Every single time you go out there, there's attacks.
p79
aVIt's unbelievable.
p80
aa(lp81
VZB: Hey, Nestor, your ass crack is right in my face.
p82
aa(lp83
VSoldiers: IV! Are we on fire? IV!
p84
aVMan down! Man down!
p85
aa(lp86
VMM: Keep going, brother. You wanna play?
p87
aa(lp88
VMichael Moriarty's Wife: It's really hard for him to not have his dad.
p89
aa(lp90
VMM: This little kid is in the middle of a war zone.
p91
aa(lp92
VStephen Pink's Girlfriend: In the beginning, he's like, "Write something dirty!"
p93
aa(lp94
VGeorge W. Bush: The world's newest democracy.
p95
aa(lp96
VMM: They're shooting at me.
p97
aa(lp98
VSP: You don't put 150,000 troops in there,
p99
aVand say we're there to create democracy.
p100
aa(lp101
VSoldier: We've got a drive through window at Burger King now.
p102
aa(lp103
VSP: We're here to create money.
p104
aa(lp105
VMM: I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil.
p106
aa(lp107
VJon Baril: The worst thing in my life.
p108
aa(lp109
VSP: Baril, don't look at it, bud.
p110
aa(lp111
VMichael Moriarty's Wife: He's not the same person anymore.
p112
aa(lp113
VMM: I will not go back.
p114
aa(lp115
VKevin Shangraw: The Iraqi people are who we are there to help \u2014
p116
aVand we just killed one.
p117
aa(lp118
VSoldiers: Sergeant Smith is down! Sergeant Smith is down?
p119
aVThere they are! Right there! Fire, fire!
p120
aa(lp121
VJB: It'll be a better country in 20 years, 'cause we were there.
p122
aVI hope.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Applause) Deborah Scranton: Thank you.
p125
aVOne of the things I'd like to talk to you about
p126
aVis having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about.
p127
aVAnd I'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED.
p128
aVI don't know how many of you might imagine it,
p129
aVbut there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq.
p130
aVPaul? Come on, stand up.
p131
aVThis is Paul Anthony.
p132
aVHe served \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 with the Marines,
p133
aVand I want to tell you a little, brief story.
p134
aVWe were one of the lucky ones
p135
aVto get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.
p136
aVRight? And we started talking.
p137
aVPeople will see my tag, and they'll see "The War Tapes,"
p138
aVand then we'll start talking about war.
p139
aa(lp140
VWe got in a conversation with some other people in the class,
p141
aVand it went on and on.
p142
aVI mean, we were there for an hour, talking.
p143
aVAnd it really highlighted something that I would like to ask
p144
aVyou guys to think about and hopefully to help with,
p145
aVwhich is, I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war,
p146
aVand about politics.
p147
aVAnd really \u2014 because maybe we're going to disagree.
p148
aVMaybe it's going to get uncomfortable.
p149
aVHow do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?
p150
aVAnd you know, Paul was talking,
p151
aVand he then turned to Constance and said,
p152
aV"You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here,
p153
aVbecause I know she has my back."
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd I want to say, I was nervous.
p156
aVBecause I'm used to doing Q&As.
p157
aVI really related to what James was saying yesterday,
p158
aVbecause I'm behind the camera.
p159
aVYou know, I can answer questions about my movie,
p160
aVbut for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time.
p161
aVSo, I wanted to say, Paul, I'm happy you're here,
p162
aVbecause I know you have my back.
p163
aa(lp164
VThis film was not about the Internet,
p165
aVbut it could not have been made without it.
p166
aVThe guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me.
p167
aVIn the meantime, the soldiers \u2014 we would email and IM.
p168
aVI didn't save all of them,
p169
aVbecause I didn't realize at the beginning
p170
aVthat it would be something that I would want to keep track of.
p171
aVBut there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages
p172
aVthat I was able to save.
p173
aVThe reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey
p174
aVto really get inside of it.
p175
aVSo I wanted to show you a clip,
p176
aVand then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together.
p177
aVIf we could roll the clip.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Video) SP: Today is sport. [Unclear] Radio: [Unclear] Christian soldiers.
p180
aVSP: We like to give these insurgents a fair chance.
p181
aVSo, what we do, we ride with the windows down.
p182
aVBecause, you know, we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding.
p183
aVWe don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down.
p184
aVIt's not true. Very unsafe.
p185
aVWhoa.
p186
aa(lp187
VSoldier: Right there.
p188
aa(lp189
VSP: All right, let's get over to that site.
p190
aVBe advised, we're leaving Taji right now.
p191
aVWe believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji,
p192
aVwe're heading to that location now.
p193
aa(lp194
VSoldier: That's a fucking car bomb!
p195
aa(lp196
VSoldier: Motherfuckers!
p197
aa(lp198
VSoldiers: Get your vest on!
p199
aVHey, get over the fucking \u2014 yeah, yeah.
p200
aVAny one-four elements get to the gate!
p201
aa(lp202
VSP: Sheriff one-six, or any one-four elements,
p203
aVwe need you at the gate of Taji right now, over.
p204
aa(lp205
VSoldier: I'll walk you through it.
p206
aV(Voices)
p207
aa(lp208
VSP: Stay low. Head over to the right.
p209
aVGet your bag, get your bag!
p210
aV(Screams)
p211
aa(lp212
VSP: It was mass casualties.
p213
aVProbably 20 dead, at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis.
p214
aa(lp215
VSP: It just looked like, you know,
p216
aVsomeone had thrown a quarter through a guy,
p217
aVand it was just like \u2014 there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds.
p218
aVEverything was cauterized,
p219
aVand it was just like there was a void going through the body.
p220
aVThis is the scene north.
p221
aVThey just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here.
p222
aVI don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down.
p223
aVThis is blood.
p224
aVAnd you know, you walk,
p225
aVand you hear the pieces of skin.
p226
aVAnd that's it, that's all that's left.
p227
aVI remember giving three IVs, bandaging several wounded.
p228
aVSoldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall, shaking and screaming.
p229
aVMedics who were terrified and couldn't perform.
p230
aVI later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji.
p231
aVThey can work on the post for pennies, but can't die there.
p232
aVThey've got to die outside.
p233
aVIf one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment,
p234
aVI would've slit his throat right there.
p235
aV21:00 hours, and it's just our squad
p236
aVgoing through today's events in our heads,
p237
aVwhether we want to or not.
p238
aa(lp239
VNews Anchor: More violence in Iraq.
p240
aVTwin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more
p241
aVnear a coalition base north of Baghdad.
p242
aa(lp243
VSP: We made the news.
p244
aVI feel exploited and proud at the same time.
p245
aVI've lost all faith in the media \u2014
p246
aVa hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of.
p247
aVI should really thank God for saving my lucky ass.
p248
aVI'll do that, then I'm gonna jerk off.
p249
aVBecause these pages smell like Linds,
p250
aVand there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow.
p251
aVAnother mission at 06:00.
p252
aa(lp253
VDS: Now \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 thanks.
p254
aVWhen I said earlier, to try and tell a story from the inside out, versus the outside in \u2014
p255
aVpart of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction \u2014 is this melding.
p256
aVIt's a new way of trying to make a documentary.
p257
aVWhen I met the guys, and 10 of them agreed to take cameras \u2014
p258
aVin total, 21 ended up filming.
p259
aVFive soldiers filmed the entire time.
p260
aVThere are three featured in the film.
p261
aa(lp262
VThe way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email,
p263
aVand in it, attached a photo of that burned body out at the car.
p264
aVAnd the tone from the email was,
p265
aVyou know, it had been a very bad day, obviously.
p266
aVAnd I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base.
p267
aVSo, I pinged Mike and I said,
p268
aV"Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?"
p269
aVBecause the thing that very often is missing is,
p270
aVin the military what they call "hot wash."
p271
aVIt's that immediate interview after something immediately happens, you know.
p272
aVAnd if you let time go by,
p273
aVit kind of softens and smooths the edges.
p274
aVAnd for me, I really wanted that.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo, in order to get the intimacy,
p277
aVto share that experience with you, the guys \u2014
p278
aVthe two most popular mounts \u2014
p279
aVthere was a camera on the turret, the gun turret,
p280
aVand then on the dashboard of the Humvee.
p281
aVMost of the Humvees, we ended up mounting two cameras in them.
p282
aVSo you get to experience that in real time, right?
p283
aVThe interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did
p284
aVwithin 24 hours of that episode happening.
p285
aa(lp286
VSteve Pink reading his journal
p287
aVhappened five months after he came home.
p288
aVI knew about that journal, but it was very, very private.
p289
aVAnd you know, you earn someone's trust,
p290
aVespecially in doc filmmaking, through your relationship.
p291
aVSo, it wasn't until five months after he was home
p292
aVthat he would read that journal.
p293
aa(lp294
VNow, the news footage I put in there to try to show \u2014
p295
aVyou know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can
p296
aVin the format that they have.
p297
aVBut the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times,
p298
aVAmerican soldiers saying,
p299
aV"Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do?"
p300
aVOK, this is a perfect example.
p301
aVPink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire.
p302
aVThey didn't have to go outside the wire.
p303
aVThere were not Americans hurt out there.
p304
aVThey spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives \u2014
p305
aVthe Iraqis who work on the post.
p306
aVSo, when you may hear soldiers complaining,
p307
aVthat's what they're talking about, you know?
p308
aVAnd I think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this
p309
aVas a way of bridging.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q&As,
p312
aVand people are really opinionated.
p313
aVBut it seems like people don't want to hear so much,
p314
aVor listen, or try to have an exchange.
p315
aVAnd I'm as fiery as the next person, but I really think \u2014
p316
aVyou know, different speakers have talked about their concern for the world,
p317
aVand my concern is that we have to have these conversations.
p318
aVAnd we have to be able to go into scary places where we may, you know,
p319
aVwe think we know.
p320
aVBut we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know.
p321
aVThere's such a disconnect.
p322
aVAnd for me, it's trying to bridge that disconnect.
p323
aVI'll share one story.
p324
aVI get \u2014 I'm often asked, you know, for me,
p325
aVwhat have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film.
p326
aVAnd at screenings, inevitably \u2014
p327
aVyou know, as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff \u2014
p328
aVusually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions.
p329
aVAnd usually, the first questions are,
p330
aV"Oh, what kind of cameras did you use?"
p331
aVOr you know, these things.
p332
aa(lp333
VBut there's always a few guys, almost always, who are the last ones.
p334
aVAnd I've learned over time that those are always the soldiers.
p335
aVAnd they wait until pretty much everybody's gone.
p336
aVAnd for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me,
p337
aVthat then became my story, was \u2014
p338
aVfor those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler \u2014
p339
aVit's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents,
p340
aVwhere people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.
p341
aVIn this film, there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed.
p342
aVA soldier came up to me and stood, you know really, pretty close,
p343
aVa foot away from me.
p344
aVHe's a big guy.
p345
aVAnd he looked at me, and I smiled,
p346
aVand then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes.
p347
aVAnd he wasn't going to blink.
p348
aVAnd he said, "My gunner was throwing candy."
p349
aVAnd I knew what he was going to say.
p350
aVThe gunner was throwing candy.
p351
aVThey used to throw candy to the kids.
p352
aVKids got too close, very often.
p353
aVAnd he said, "I killed a child.
p354
aVAnd I'm a father. I have children.
p355
aVI haven't been able to tell my wife.
p356
aVI'm afraid she's going to think I'm a monster."
p357
aVI hugged him, of course,
p358
aVand I said, you know, "It's going to be OK."
p359
aVAnd he said, "I'm going to bring her to see your film.
p360
aVAnd then I'm going to tell her."
p361
aa(lp362
VSo when I talk about a disconnect,
p363
aVit's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier,
p364
aVwhich there obviously are. You know, these days,
p365
aVit's not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front,
p366
aVand everybody seemed involved.
p367
aVYou can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on.
p368
aVAnd often, I'll hear people say,
p369
aVwho maybe know that I did this film,
p370
aVand they say, "Oh, you know, I'm against the war, but I support the soldiers."
p371
aVAnd I've started to ask them,
p372
aV"Well, that's nice. What are you doing?
p373
aVAre you volunteering at a VA?
p374
aVYou go and see anybody?
p375
aVDo you, if you find out your neighbor's been, do you spend some time?
p376
aVNot necessarily ask questions, but see if they want to talk?
p377
aVDo you give money to any of the charities?"
p378
aVYou know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing,
p379
aVbut there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers.
p380
aa(lp381
VI think, I challenge us to say \u2014
p382
aVto operationalize those terms, when we say we support someone, you know?
p383
aVAre you a friend to them?
p384
aVDo you really care?
p385
aVAnd I would just say it's my hope, and I would ask you guys
p386
aVto please, you know, reach out a hand.
p387
aVAnd really do give them a hug.
p388
aVThank you.

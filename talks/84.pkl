VAs someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible
p5
aa(lp6
Vstanding in front of an audience is a cross between
p7
aVan out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights,
p8
aVso please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments
p9
aVby relying on words on paper,
p10
aVand I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done.
p11
aVI'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me
p12
aVto become a documentary photographer.
p13
aa(lp14
VI was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,
p15
aVand on a personal level, an awakening sense of idealism.
p16
aVThe war in Vietnam was raging;
p17
aVthe Civil Rights Movement was under way;
p18
aVand pictures had a powerful influence on me.
p19
aVOur political and military leaders were telling us one thing,
p20
aVand photographers were telling us another.
p21
aVI believed the photographers, and so did millions of other Americans.
p22
aVTheir images fueled resistance to the war and to racism.
p23
aVThey not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history.
p24
aVTheir pictures became part of our collective consciousness
p25
aVand, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,
p26
aVchange became not only possible, but inevitable.
p27
aa(lp28
VI saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism,
p29
aVspecifically visual journalism, can bring into focus
p30
aVboth the benefits and the cost of political policies.
p31
aVIt can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success.
p32
aVIn the face of poor political judgment or political inaction,
p33
aVit becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage
p34
aVand asking us to reassess our behavior.
p35
aVIt puts a human face on issues
p36
aVwhich from afar can appear abstract
p37
aVor ideological or monumental in their global impact.
p38
aVWhat happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,
p39
aVhappens to ordinary citizens one by one.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd I understood that documentary photography
p42
aVhas the ability to interpret events from their point of view.
p43
aVIt gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.
p44
aVAnd as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion
p45
aVand gives impetus to public debate,
p46
aVthereby preventing the interested parties
p47
aVfrom totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to.
p48
aVComing of age in those days made real
p49
aVthe concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital
p50
aVfor a free and dynamic society to function properly.
p51
aVThe press is certainly a business, and in order to survive
p52
aVit must be a successful business,
p53
aVbut the right balance must be found
p54
aVbetween marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility.
p55
aa(lp56
VSociety's problems can't be solved until they're identified.
p57
aVOn a higher plane, the press is a service industry,
p58
aVand the service it provides is awareness.
p59
aVEvery story does not have to sell something.
p60
aVThere's also a time to give.
p61
aVThat was a tradition I wanted to follow.
p62
aVSeeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved
p63
aVand that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution \u2014
p64
aVI wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer.
p65
aVBut I was driven by an inherent sense
p66
aVthat a picture that revealed the true face of war
p67
aVwould almost by definition be an anti-war photograph.
p68
aa(lp69
VI'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events
p70
aVand issues I've been involved in over the past 25 years.
p71
aVIn 1981, I went to Northern Ireland.
p72
aV10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death
p73
aVin protest against conditions in jail.
p74
aVThe reaction on the streets was violent confrontation.
p75
aVI saw that the front lines of contemporary wars
p76
aVare not on isolated battlefields, but right where people live.
p77
aVDuring the early '80s, I spent a lot of time in Central America,
p78
aVwhich was engulfed by civil wars
p79
aVthat straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War.
p80
aa(lp81
VIn Guatemala, the central government \u2014
p82
aVcontrolled by a oligarchy of European decent \u2014
p83
aVwas waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion,
p84
aVand I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America:
p85
aVconquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword.
p86
aVAn anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded
p87
aVas Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua.
p88
aVA destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard
p89
aVwas left as a monument in a park in Managua,
p90
aVand was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child.
p91
aVAt the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador,
p92
aVand again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict.
p93
aa(lp94
VI've been covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since 1981.
p95
aVThis is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada, in 2000,
p96
aVwhen it was still stones and Molotovs against an army.
p97
aVIn 2001, the uprising escalated into an armed conflict,
p98
aVand one of the major incidents was
p99
aVthe destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp
p100
aVin the West Bank town of Jenin.
p101
aVWithout the political will to find common ground,
p102
aVthe continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic
p103
aVonly creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance,
p104
aVand perpetuates the cycle of violence.
p105
aa(lp106
VIn the '90s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union,
p107
aVYugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines, and civil war broke out
p108
aVbetween Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.
p109
aVThis is a scene of house-to-house fighting in Mostar,
p110
aVneighbor against neighbor.
p111
aVA bedroom, the place where people share intimacy,
p112
aVwhere life itself is conceived, became a battlefield.
p113
aVA mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery
p114
aVand was used as a makeshift morgue.
p115
aVDead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle
p116
aVand used as barter for the return of prisoners
p117
aVor Bosnian soldiers killed in action.
p118
aVThis was once a park.
p119
aVThe Bosnian soldier who guided me
p120
aVtold me that all of his friends were there now.
p121
aa(lp122
VAt the same time in South Africa,
p123
aVafter Nelson Mandela had been released from prison,
p124
aVthe black population commenced the final phase
p125
aVof liberation from apartheid.
p126
aVOne of the things I had to learn as a journalist
p127
aVwas what to do with my anger.
p128
aVI had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something
p129
aVthat would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it.
p130
aVIn Transkei, I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood, of the Xhosa tribe.
p131
aVTeenage boys lived in isolation, their bodies covered with white clay.
p132
aVAfter several weeks, they washed off the white
p133
aVand took on the full responsibilities of men.
p134
aVIt was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic
p135
aVof the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa.
p136
aa(lp137
VChildren in Soweto playing on a trampoline.
p138
aVElsewhere in Africa there was famine.
p139
aVIn Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out.
p140
aVFarmers were driven off their land,
p141
aVand crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen.
p142
aVStarvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction \u2014
p143
aVprimitive but extremely effective.
p144
aVHundreds of thousands of people were exterminated,
p145
aVslowly and painfully.
p146
aVThe international community responded with massive humanitarian relief,
p147
aVand hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved.
p148
aVAmerican troops were sent to protect the relief shipments,
p149
aVbut they were eventually drawn into the conflict,
p150
aVand after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn.
p151
aVIn southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation
p152
aVas a means of genocide.
p153
aa(lp154
VAgain, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N.,
p155
aVstaged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved.
p156
aVI'm a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored.
p157
aVI also want it to be powerful and eloquent,
p158
aVand to do as much justice as possible
p159
aVto the experience of the people I'm photographing.
p160
aVThis man was in an NGO feeding center,
p161
aVbeing helped as much as he could be helped.
p162
aVHe literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton,
p163
aVyet he could still summon the courage and the will to move.
p164
aVHe had not given up, and if he didn't give up,
p165
aVhow could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope?
p166
aVIn 1994, after three months of covering the South African election,
p167
aVI saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela,
p168
aVand it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen.
p169
aVIt exemplified the best that humanity has to offer.
p170
aVThe next day I left for Rwanda,
p171
aVand it was like taking the express elevator to hell.
p172
aa(lp173
VThis man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp.
p174
aVHe allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time,
p175
aVand he even turned his face toward the light,
p176
aVas if he wanted me to see him better.
p177
aVI think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world.
p178
aVThis time, maybe confused or discouraged
p179
aVby the military disaster in Somalia,
p180
aVthe international community remained silent,
p181
aVand somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered
p182
aVby their own countrymen \u2014 sometimes their own neighbors \u2014
p183
aVusing farm implements as weapons.
p184
aa(lp185
VPerhaps because a lesson had been learned
p186
aVby the weak response to the war in Bosnia
p187
aVand the failure in Rwanda,
p188
aVwhen Serbia attacked Kosovo,
p189
aVinternational action was taken much more decisively.
p190
aVNATO forces went in, and the Serbian army withdrew.
p191
aVEthnic Albanians had been murdered,
p192
aVtheir farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported.
p193
aVThey were received in refugee camps
p194
aVset up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia.
p195
aVThe imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home.
p196
aVThe image reminded me of a cave painting,
p197
aVand echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways.
p198
aa(lp199
VBetween 1995 and '96, I covered the first two wars
p200
aVin Chechnya from inside Grozny.
p201
aVThis is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army.
p202
aVThe Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks,
p203
aVkilling mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside.
p204
aVI found a boy from the local orphanage
p205
aVwandering around the front line.
p206
aVMy work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war
p207
aVto a focus on critical social issues as well.
p208
aVAfter the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania
p209
aVand discovered a kind of gulag of children,
p210
aVwhere thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions.
p211
aVCeausescu had imposed a quota
p212
aVon the number of children to be produced by each family,
p213
aVthereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy.
p214
aVChildren who couldn't be supported by their families
p215
aVwere raised in government orphanages.
p216
aVChildren with birth defects were labeled incurables,
p217
aVand confined for life to inhuman conditions.
p218
aa(lp219
VAs reports began to surface, again international aid went in.
p220
aVGoing deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes,
p221
aVI worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution,
p222
aVwhere there had been no regard for the environment
p223
aVor the health of either workers or the general population.
p224
aVAn aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia
p225
aVwas filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust,
p226
aVand four out of five workers came down with cancer.
p227
aa(lp228
VAfter the fall of Suharto in Indonesia,
p229
aVI began to explore conditions of poverty
p230
aVin a country that was on its way towards modernization.
p231
aVI spent a good deal of time with a man
p232
aVwho lived with his family on a railway embankment
p233
aVand had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident.
p234
aVWhen the story was published, unsolicited donations poured in.
p235
aVA trust fund was established,
p236
aVand the family now lives in a house in the countryside
p237
aVand all their basic necessities are taken care of.
p238
aVIt was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything.
p239
aVJournalism had provided a channel
p240
aVfor people's natural sense of generosity, and the readers responded.
p241
aVI met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside,
p242
aVand ended up living in a train station.
p243
aVBy the age of 12 or 14, they'd become beggars and drug addicts.
p244
aVThe rural poor had become the urban poor,
p245
aVand in the process, they'd become invisible.
p246
aa(lp247
VThese heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan
p248
aVreminded me of figures in a play by Beckett:
p249
aVisolated, waiting in the dark, but drawn to the light.
p250
aVAgent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War
p251
aVto deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army.
p252
aVThe active ingredient was dioxin, an extremely toxic chemical
p253
aVthat was sprayed in vast quantities,
p254
aVand whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation.
p255
aVIn 2000, I began documenting global health issues,
p256
aVconcentrating first on AIDS in Africa.
p257
aVI tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers.
p258
aVI thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped,
p259
aVwhether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo many children have been orphaned by the epidemic
p262
aVthat grandmothers have taken the place of parents,
p263
aVand a lot of children had been born with HIV.
p264
aVA hospital in Zambia.
p265
aVI began documenting the close connection
p266
aVbetween HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.
p267
aVThis is an MSF hospital in Cambodia.
p268
aVMy pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs
p269
aVby shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with.
p270
aVI went to Congo with MSF,
p271
aVand contributed to a book and an exhibition
p272
aVthat focused attention on a forgotten war
p273
aVin which millions of people have died,
p274
aVand exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon.
p275
aVA malnourished child being measured
p276
aVas part of the supplemental feeding program.
p277
aa(lp278
VIn the fall of 2004 I went to Darfur.
p279
aVThis time I was on assignment for a magazine,
p280
aVbut again worked closely with MSF.
p281
aVThe international community still hasn't found a way
p282
aVto create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide.
p283
aVAn MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people.
p284
aVI've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America.
p285
aVThis is a scene from New Orleans.
p286
aVA prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama
p287
aVwas punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun.
p288
aVThis experience raised a lot of questions,
p289
aVamong them questions about race and equality
p290
aVand for whom in our country opportunities and options are available.
p291
aVIn the yard of a chain gang in Alabama.
p292
aa(lp293
VI didn't see either of the planes hit,
p294
aVand when I glanced out my window, I saw the first tower burning,
p295
aVand I thought it might have been an accident.
p296
aVA few minutes later when I looked again
p297
aVand saw the second tower burning, I knew we were at war.
p298
aVIn the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero, I had a realization.
p299
aVI'd been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981 \u2014
p300
aVnot only in the Middle East, but also in Africa, Asia and Europe.
p301
aVAt the time I was photographing in these different places,
p302
aVI thought I was covering separate stories,
p303
aVbut on 9/11 history crystallized, and I understood
p304
aVI'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years,
p305
aVand the attack on New York was its latest manifestation.
p306
aa(lp307
VThe central commercial district of Kabul, Afghanistan
p308
aVat the end of the civil war,
p309
aVshortly before the city fell to the Taliban.
p310
aVLand mine victims being helped
p311
aVat the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo.
p312
aVA boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine.
p313
aVI'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world
p314
aVfrom political oppression, civil war, foreign invasions, poverty, famine.
p315
aVI understood that in its suffering,
p316
aVthe Islamic world had been crying out. Why weren't we listening?
p317
aVA Taliban fighter shot during a battle
p318
aVas the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz.
p319
aVWhen war with Iraq was imminent,
p320
aVI realized the American troops would be very well covered,
p321
aVso I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad.
p322
aVA marketplace was hit by a mortar shell
p323
aVthat killed several members of a single family.
p324
aVA day after American forces entered Baghdad,
p325
aVa company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers
p326
aVand were cheered on by the crowds \u2014
p327
aVa hopeful moment that was short lived.
p328
aa(lp329
VFor the first time in years,
p330
aVShi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage
p331
aVto Karbala to observe Ashura,
p332
aVand I was amazed by the sheer number of people
p333
aVand how fervently they practiced their religion.
p334
aVA group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives.
p335
aVIt was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with,
p336
aVand we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them.
p337
aVLast year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops,
p338
aVfrom the battlefield in Iraq all the way home.
p339
aa(lp340
VThis is a helicopter medic giving CPR
p341
aVto a soldier who had been shot in the head.
p342
aVMilitary medicine has become so efficient
p343
aVthat the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded
p344
aVis much higher in this war than in any other war in our history.
p345
aVThe signature weapon of the war is the IED,
p346
aVand the signature wound is severe leg damage.
p347
aVAfter enduring extreme pain and trauma,
p348
aVthe wounded face a grueling physical
p349
aVand psychological struggle in rehab.
p350
aVThe spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable.
p351
aVI tried to imagine myself in their place,
p352
aVand I was totally humbled by their courage and determination
p353
aVin the face of such catastrophic loss.
p354
aVGood people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results.
p355
aVOne day in rehab someone, started talking about surfing
p356
aVand all these guys who'd never surfed before said, "Hey, let's go."
p357
aVAnd they went surfing.
p358
aa(lp359
VPhotographers go to the extreme edges of human experience
p360
aVto show people what's going on.
p361
aVSometimes they put their lives on the line,
p362
aVbecause they believe your opinions and your influence matter.
p363
aVThey aim their pictures at your best instincts,
p364
aVgenerosity, a sense of right and wrong,
p365
aVthe ability and the willingness to identify with others,
p366
aVthe refusal to accept the unacceptable.
p367
aVMy TED wish:
p368
aVthere's a vital story that needs to be told,
p369
aVand I wish for TED to help me gain access to it
p370
aVand then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways
p371
aVto use news photography in the digital era.
p372
aVThank you very much.

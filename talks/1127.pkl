VI'm very fortunate to be here.
p5
aVI feel so fortunate.
p6
aVI've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me.
p7
aVI called my wife Leslie,
p8
aVand I said, "You know, there's so many good people
p9
aVtrying to do so much good.
p10
aVIt feels like I've landed in a colony of angels."
p11
aVIt's a true feeling.
p12
aVBut let me get to the talk \u2014 I see the clock is running.
p13
aa(lp14
VI'm a public school teacher,
p15
aVand I just want to share a story of my superintendent.
p16
aVHer name is Pam Moran
p17
aVin Albemarle County, Virginia,
p18
aVthe foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
p19
aVAnd she's a very high-tech superintendent.
p20
aVShe uses smart boards, she blogs,
p21
aVshe Tweets, she does Facebook,
p22
aVshe does all this sort of high-tech stuff.
p23
aVShe's a technology leader and instructional leader.
p24
aVBut in her office,
p25
aVthere's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table \u2014
p26
aVpeeling green paint, it's kind of rickety.
p27
aVAnd I said, "Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person.
p28
aVWhy is this old table in your office?"
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd she told me, she said,
p31
aV"You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia,
p32
aVin the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia,
p33
aVand this table was in my grandfather's kitchen.
p34
aVAnd we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working,
p35
aVand we'd sit around that table every night.
p36
aVAnd as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge
p37
aVand so many insights and so much wisdom
p38
aVcome out around this table,
p39
aVI began to call it the wisdom table.
p40
aVAnd when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office,
p41
aVand it reminds me of him.
p42
aVIt reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes."
p43
aVThe project I'm going to tell you about
p44
aVis called the World Peace Game,
p45
aVand essentially it is also an empty space.
p46
aVAnd I'd like to think of it
p47
aVas a 21st century wisdom table, really.
p48
aa(lp49
VIt all started back in 1977.
p50
aVI was a young man,
p51
aVand I had been dropping in and out of college.
p52
aVAnd my parents were very patient,
p53
aVbut I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India
p54
aVon a mystical quest.
p55
aVAnd I remember the last time I came back from India \u2014
p56
aVin my long white flowing robes
p57
aVand my big beard and my John Lennon glasses \u2014
p58
aVand I said to my father,
p59
aV"Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment."
p60
aVHe said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find."
p61
aVI said, "What is that, dad?" "A job."
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVAnd so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.
p64
aVSo I got a degree
p65
aVand it turned out to be education.
p66
aVIt was an experimental education program.
p67
aVIt could have been dentistry, but the word "experimental" was in it,
p68
aVand so that's what I had to go for.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd I went in for a job interview
p71
aVin the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city,
p72
aVbought a three-piece suit \u2014 my concession to convention \u2014
p73
aVkept my long beard and my afro
p74
aVand my platform shoes \u2014 at the time it was the '70s \u2014
p75
aVand I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.
p76
aVAnd I guess they were hard up for teachers
p77
aVbecause the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro,
p78
aVsaid I had the job teaching gifted children.
p79
aVAnd I was so shocked, so stunned,
p80
aVI got up and said, "Well, thank you, but what do I do?"
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aVGifted education hadn't really taken hold too much.
p83
aVThere weren't really many materials or things to use.
p84
aVAnd I said, "What do I do?"
p85
aVAnd her answer shocked me. It stunned me.
p86
aVHer answer set the template
p87
aVfor the entire career I was to have after that.
p88
aVShe said, "What do you want to do?"
p89
aVAnd that question cleared the space.
p90
aVThere was no program directive, no manual to follow,
p91
aVno standards in gifted education
p92
aVin that way.
p93
aVAnd she cleared such a space
p94
aVthat I endeavored from then on
p95
aVto clear a space for my students, an empty space,
p96
aVwhereby they could create and make meaning
p97
aVout of their own understanding.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo this happened in 1978,
p100
aVand I was teaching many years later,
p101
aVand a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.
p102
aVHis name is Chris Farina.
p103
aVChris Farina is here today at his own cost.
p104
aVChris, could you stand up and let them see you \u2014
p105
aVa young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film.
p106
aV(Applause)
p107
aVThis film is called "World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements."
p108
aVHe proposed the film to me \u2014 it's a great title.
p109
aVHe proposed the film to me,
p110
aVand I said, "Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV,
p111
aVand we can say hi to our friends."
p112
aVBut the film has really gone places.
p113
aVNow it's still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice,
p114
aVto get this film out.
p115
aVSo we made a film
p116
aVand it turns out to be more than a story about me,
p117
aVmore than a story about one teacher.
p118
aVIt's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers.
p119
aVAnd it's a beautiful thing.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd the strange thing is, when I watch the film \u2014
p122
aVI have the eerie sensation of seeing it \u2014
p123
aVI saw myself literally disappear.
p124
aVWhat I saw
p125
aVwas my teachers coming through me.
p126
aVI saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell's
p127
aVwry smile under his handlebar mustache.
p128
aVThat's the smile I use \u2014 that's his smile.
p129
aVI saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes.
p130
aVAnd they weren't flashing in anger,
p131
aVthey were flashing in love, intense love for her students.
p132
aVAnd I have that kind of flash sometimes.
p133
aVAnd I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks
p134
aVwho wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.
p135
aVAnd you know, she had that old-school teacher stare.
p136
aVYou know the one.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aV"And I'm not even talking about you behind me,
p139
aVbecause I've got eyes in the back of my head."
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aVYou know that teacher?
p142
aVI didn't use that stare very often,
p143
aVbut I do have it in my repertoire.
p144
aVAnd Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd then I saw
p147
aVmy own parents, my first teachers.
p148
aVMy father, very inventive, spatial thinker.
p149
aVThat's my brother Malcolm there on the right.
p150
aVAnd my mother,
p151
aVwho taught me in fourth grade
p152
aVin segregated schools in Virginia,
p153
aVwho was my inspiration.
p154
aVAnd really, I feel as though,
p155
aVwhen I see the film \u2014
p156
aVI have a gesture she does, like this \u2014
p157
aVI feel like I am a continuation of her gesture.
p158
aVI am one of her teaching gestures.
p159
aVAnd the beautiful thing was,
p160
aVI got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline.
p161
aVAnd so that gesture of my mother's
p162
aVcontinues through many generations.
p163
aVIt's an amazing feeling
p164
aVto have that lineage.
p165
aVAnd so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people.
p166
aVI'm not here alone.
p167
aVThere are many people on this stage right now.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about.
p170
aVIt started out like this:
p171
aVit's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board
p172
aVin an inner-city urban school, 1978.
p173
aVI was creating a lesson for students on Africa.
p174
aVWe put all the problems of the world there,
p175
aVand I thought, let's let them solve it.
p176
aVI didn't want to lecture or have just book reading.
p177
aVI wanted to have them be immersed
p178
aVand learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.
p179
aVSo I thought, well they like to play games.
p180
aVI'll make something \u2014 I didn't say interactive;
p181
aVwe didn't have that term in 1978 \u2014
p182
aVbut something interactive.
p183
aVAnd so we made the game,
p184
aVand it has since evolved
p185
aVto a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot
p186
aVPlexiglass structure.
p187
aVAnd it has four Plexiglass layers.
p188
aa(lp189
VThere's an outer space layer
p190
aVwith black holes and satellites
p191
aVand research satellites and asteroid mining.
p192
aVThere's an air and space level
p193
aVwith clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around
p194
aVand territorial air spaces and air forces,
p195
aVa ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it \u2014
p196
aVeven an undersea level
p197
aVwith submarines and undersea mining.
p198
aVThere are four countries around the board.
p199
aVThe kids make up the names of the countries \u2014 some are rich; some are poor.
p200
aVThey have different assets, commercial and military.
p201
aVAnd each country has a cabinet.
p202
aVThere's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense
p203
aVand a CFO, or Comptroller.
p204
aVI choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.
p205
aVI offer them the job, they can turn it down,
p206
aVand then they choose their own cabinet.
p207
aVThere's a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations.
p208
aVThere's also a weather goddess
p209
aVwho controls a random stock market and random weather.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VThat's not all.
p214
aVAnd then there's a 13-page crisis document
p215
aVwith 50 interlocking problems.
p216
aVSo that, if one thing changes, everything else changes.
p217
aVI throw them into this complex matrix,
p218
aVand they trust me because we have a deep, rich relationship together.
p219
aVAnd so with all these crises,
p220
aVwe have \u2014 let's see \u2014 ethnic and minority tensions;
p221
aVwe have chemical and nuclear spills,
p222
aVnuclear proliferation.
p223
aVThere's oil spills, environmental disasters,
p224
aVwater rights disputes, breakaway republics,
p225
aVfamine, endangered species and global warming.
p226
aVIf Al Gore is here,
p227
aVI'm going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you
p228
aVbecause they solved global warming in a week.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aV(Applause)
p231
aVAnd they've done it several times too.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VSo I also have in the game a saboteur \u2014
p236
aVsome child \u2014 it's basically a troublemaker \u2014
p237
aVand I have my troublemaker put to use
p238
aVbecause they, on the surface,
p239
aVare trying to save the world and their position in the game.
p240
aVBut they're also trying to undermine everything in the game.
p241
aVAnd they do it secretly through misinformation
p242
aVand ambiguities and irrelevancies,
p243
aVtrying to cause everyone to think more deeply.
p244
aVThe saboteur is there,
p245
aVand we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."
p246
aVFourth-graders understand it \u2014 nine years old \u2014
p247
aVand they handle that and use that
p248
aVto understand how to, not follow \u2014
p249
aVat first they do \u2014
p250
aVthe paths to power and destruction,
p251
aVthe path to war.
p252
aVThey learn to overlook short-sighted reactions
p253
aVand impulsive thinking,
p254
aVto think in a long-term, more consequential way.
p255
aa(lp256
VStewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him
p257
aVwith a CoEvolution Quarterly article
p258
aVon a peace force.
p259
aVAnd in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force.
p260
aVI'm just a clock watcher.
p261
aVI'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator.
p262
aVThe students run the game.
p263
aVI have no chance to make any policy whatsoever
p264
aVonce they start playing.
p265
aVSo I'll just share with you ...
p266
aa(lp267
V(Video) Boy: The World Peace Game is serious.
p268
aVYou're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world.
p269
aVSee, Mr. Hunter is doing that
p270
aVbecause he says his time has messed up a lot,
p271
aVand he's trying to tell us
p272
aVhow to fix that problem.
p273
aa(lp274
VJohn Hunter: I offered them a \u2014
p275
aV(Applause)
p276
aVActually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer.
p277
aVAnd I admit the truth to them right up front: I don't know.
p278
aVAnd because I don't know, they've got to dig up the answer.
p279
aVAnd so I apologize to them as well.
p280
aVI say, "I'm so sorry, boys and girls,
p281
aVbut the truth is
p282
aVwe have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape,
p283
aVand we hope you can fix it for us,
p284
aVand maybe this game will help you learn how to do it."
p285
aVIt's a sincere apology,
p286
aVand they take it very seriously.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like.
p289
aVWell when we have the game start, here's what you see.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Video) JH: All right, we're going into negotiations as of now. Go.
p292
aV(Chatter)
p293
aa(lp294
VJH: My question to you is, who's in charge of that classroom?
p295
aVIt's a serious question: who is really in charge?
p296
aVI've learned to cede control of the classroom
p297
aVover to the students over time.
p298
aVThere's a trust and an understanding
p299
aVand a dedication to an ideal
p300
aVthat I simply don't have to do
p301
aVwhat I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher:
p302
aVcontrol every conversation and response in the classroom.
p303
aVIt's impossible. Their collective wisdom
p304
aVis much greater than mine,
p305
aVand I admit it to them openly.
p306
aVSo I'll just share with you some stories very quickly
p307
aVof some magical things that have happened.
p308
aa(lp309
VIn this game we had a little girl,
p310
aVand she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation.
p311
aVAnd the Defense Minister \u2014 she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth.
p312
aVAnd she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor.
p313
aVWithout provocation,
p314
aVsuddenly she attacked, against her Prime Minister's orders,
p315
aVthe next-door neighbor's oil fields.
p316
aVShe marched into the oil field reserves,
p317
aVsurrounded it, without firing a shot,
p318
aVand secured it and held it.
p319
aVAnd that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations
p320
aVbecause their fuel supply was locked up.
p321
aa(lp322
VWe were all upset with her, "Why are you doing this?
p323
aVThis is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you?"
p324
aV(Laughter)
p325
aVThis was a little girl and, at nine years old,
p326
aVshe held her pieces and said, "I know what I'm doing."
p327
aVTo her girlfriends she said that.
p328
aVThat's a breach there.
p329
aVAnd we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross
p330
aVa nine year-old girl with tanks.
p331
aV(Laughter)
p332
aVThey are the toughest opponents.
p333
aVAnd we were very upset.
p334
aVI thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this?
p335
aa(lp336
VBut come to find out, a few game days later \u2014
p337
aVand there are turns where we take negotiation from a team \u2014
p338
aVactually there's a negotiation period with all teams,
p339
aVand each team takes a turn,
p340
aVthen we go back in negotiation, around and around,
p341
aVso each turn around is one game day.
p342
aVSo a few game days later it came to light
p343
aVthat we found out this major country
p344
aVwas planning a military offensive
p345
aVto dominate the entire world.
p346
aVHad they had their fuel supplies, they would have done it.
p347
aVShe was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions
p348
aVlong before any of us
p349
aVand understand what was going to happen
p350
aVand made a philosophical decision
p351
aVto attack in a peace game.
p352
aa(lp353
VNow she used a small war to avert a larger war,
p354
aVso we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion
p355
aVabout whether that was right,
p356
aVconditional good, or not right.
p357
aVThat's the kind of thinking that we put them in, the situations.
p358
aVI could not have designed that in teaching it.
p359
aVIt came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Applause)
p362
aa(lp363
VAnother example, a beautiful thing happened.
p364
aVWe have a letter in the game.
p365
aVIf you're a military commander and you wage troops \u2014
p366
aVthe little plastic toys on the board \u2014 and you lose them,
p367
aVI put in a letter.
p368
aVYou have to write a letter to their parents \u2014
p369
aVthe fictional parents of your fictional troops \u2014
p370
aVexplaining what happened and offering your condolences.
p371
aVSo you have a little bit more thought
p372
aVbefore you commit to combat.
p373
aVAnd so we had this situation come up \u2014
p374
aVlast summer actually,
p375
aVat Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County \u2014
p376
aVand one of our military commanders got up to read that letter
p377
aVand one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter,
p378
aVlet's ask \u2014 there's a parent over there."
p379
aVThere was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.
p380
aV"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.
p381
aVIt'll be more realer if she reads it."
p382
aVSo we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter.
p383
aV"Sure." She started reading. She read one sentence.
p384
aVShe read two sentences.
p385
aVBy the third sentence, she was in tears.
p386
aVI was in tears.
p387
aVEverybody understood
p388
aVthat when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating.
p389
aVWe all lose.
p390
aVAnd it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding.
p391
aa(lp392
VI'll show you what my friend David says about this.
p393
aVHe's been in many battles.
p394
aa(lp395
V(Video) David: We've really had enough of people attacking.
p396
aVI mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time.
p397
aVBut now I'm feeling really weird
p398
aVbecause I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week.
p399
aVOne week he said,
p400
aV"Those who go into battle and win
p401
aVwill want to go back,
p402
aVand those who lose in battle
p403
aVwill want to go back and win."
p404
aVAnd so I've been winning battles,
p405
aVso I'm going into battles, more battles.
p406
aVAnd I think it's sort of weird to be living
p407
aVwhat Sun Tzu said.
p408
aa(lp409
VJH: I get chills every time I see that.
p410
aVThat's the kind of engagement you want to have happen.
p411
aVAnd I can't design that, I can't plan that,
p412
aVand I can't even test that.
p413
aVBut it's self-evident assessment.
p414
aVWe know that's an authentic assessment of learning.
p415
aVWe have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data
p416
aVwith the real truth of what's going on.
p417
aa(lp418
VSo I'll just share a third story.
p419
aVThis is about my friend Brennan.
p420
aVWe had played the game one session after school
p421
aVfor many weeks, about seven weeks,
p422
aVand we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises.
p423
aVThe way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved
p424
aVand every country's asset value
p425
aVhas to be increased above its starting point.
p426
aVSome are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.
p427
aVThe World Bank president was a third-grader one time.
p428
aVHe says, "How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away."
p429
aVBut he was setting fiscal policy in that game
p430
aVfor high school players who were playing with him.
p431
aa(lp432
VSo the team that was the poorest
p433
aVhad gotten even poorer.
p434
aVThere was no way they could win.
p435
aVAnd we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time \u2014
p436
aVthere was about a minute left \u2014
p437
aVand despair just settled over the room.
p438
aVI thought, I'm failing as a teacher.
p439
aVI should have gotten it so they could have won.
p440
aVThey shouldn't be failing like this.
p441
aVI've failed them.
p442
aVAnd I was just feeling so sad and dejected.
p443
aVAnd suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair
p444
aVand he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring
p445
aVto signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets,
p446
aVand he ran back to his seat, rang the bell.
p447
aVEverybody ran to his chair: there was screaming;
p448
aVthere was yelling, waving of their dossiers.
p449
aVThey get these dossiers full of secret documents.
p450
aVThey were gesticulating; they were running around.
p451
aVI didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom.
p452
aVPrincipal walks in, I'm out of a job.
p453
aVThe parents were looking in the window.
p454
aa(lp455
VAnd Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat.
p456
aVHe rings the bell again. He says, "We have" \u2014
p457
aVand there's 12 seconds left on the clock \u2014
p458
aV"we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together.
p459
aVAnd we've got 600 billion dollars.
p460
aVWe're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country.
p461
aVAnd if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game.
p462
aVWill you accept it?"
p463
aVAnd there are three seconds left on the clock.
p464
aVEverybody looks at this prime minister of that country,
p465
aVand he says, "Yes."
p466
aVAnd the game is won.
p467
aVSpontaneous compassion
p468
aVthat could not be planned for,
p469
aVthat was unexpected and unpredictable.
p470
aa(lp471
VEvery game we play is different.
p472
aVSome games are more about social issues,
p473
aVsome are more about economic issues.
p474
aVSome games are more about warfare.
p475
aVBut I don't try to deny them that reality of being human.
p476
aVI allow them to go there
p477
aVand, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way,
p478
aVhow not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing.
p479
aVAnd they find out what is right
p480
aVtheir own way, their own selves.
p481
aVAnd so in this game,
p482
aVI've learned so much from it,
p483
aVbut I would say
p484
aVthat if only
p485
aVthey could pick up a critical thinking tool
p486
aVor creative thinking tool
p487
aVfrom this game
p488
aVand leverage something good for the world,
p489
aVthey may save us all.
p490
aVIf only.
p491
aa(lp492
VAnd on behalf of all of my teachers
p493
aVon whose shoulders I'm standing,
p494
aVthank you. Thank you. Thank you.

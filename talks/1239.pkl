VI'm a garbage man.
p5
aVAnd you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man,
p6
aVbecause I absolutely hate waste.
p7
aVI hope, within the next 10 minutes,
p8
aVto change the way you think
p9
aVabout a lot of the stuff in your life.
p10
aVAnd I'd like to start at the very beginning.
p11
aVThink back when you were just a kid.
p12
aVHow did look at the stuff in your life?
p13
aVPerhaps it was like these toddler rules:
p14
aVIt's my stuff if I saw it first.
p15
aVThe entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.
p16
aVThe more stuff that's mine, the better.
p17
aVAnd of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VWell after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry,
p22
aVit's become pretty clear to me
p23
aVthat we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind
p24
aVas we develop into adults.
p25
aVAnd let me tell you why I have that perspective.
p26
aVBecause each and every day
p27
aVat our recycling plants around the world
p28
aVwe handle about one million pounds
p29
aVof people's discarded stuff.
p30
aVNow a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff,
p31
aVbut it's a tiny drop of the durable goods
p32
aVthat are disposed each and every year around the world \u2014
p33
aVwell less than one percent.
p34
aVIn fact, the United Nations estimates
p35
aVthat there's about 85 billion pounds a year
p36
aVof electronics waste
p37
aVthat gets discarded around the world each and every year \u2014
p38
aVand that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.
p39
aVAnd if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth,
p40
aVthat number well more than doubles.
p41
aVAnd of course, the more developed the country,
p42
aVthe bigger these mountains.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow when you see these mountains,
p45
aVmost people think of garbage.
p46
aVWe see above-ground mines.
p47
aVAnd the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials
p48
aVthat went into making all of this stuff in the first place.
p49
aVAnd it's becoming increasingly important
p50
aVthat we figure out how to extract these raw materials
p51
aVfrom these extremely complicated waste streams.
p52
aVBecause as we've heard all week at TED,
p53
aVthe world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it
p54
aVwho want more and more stuff.
p55
aVAnd of course, they want the toys and the tools
p56
aVthat many of us take for granted.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd what goes into making those toys and tools
p59
aVthat we use every single day?
p60
aVIt's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.
p61
aVAnd the metals, we typically get
p62
aVfrom ore that we mine
p63
aVin ever widening mines
p64
aVand ever deepening mines around the world.
p65
aVAnd the plastics, we get from oil,
p66
aVwhich we go to more remote locations
p67
aVand drill ever deeper wells to extract.
p68
aVAnd these practices have
p69
aVsignificant economic and environmental implications
p70
aVthat we're already starting to see today.
p71
aa(lp72
VThe good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff
p73
aVand starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff,
p74
aVparticularly in regions of the world like here in Europe
p75
aVthat have recycling policies in place
p76
aVthat require that this stuff be recycled
p77
aVin a responsible manner.
p78
aVMost of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff,
p79
aVif it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.
p80
aVTo put that in perspective \u2014
p81
aVand I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals,
p82
aVbecause it's the most common metal \u2014
p83
aVif your stuff makes it to a recycler,
p84
aVprobably over 90 percent of the metals
p85
aVare going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.
p86
aVPlastics are a whole other story:
p87
aVwell less than 10 percent are recovered.
p88
aVIn fact, it's more like five percent.
p89
aVMost of it's incinerated or landfilled.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material,
p92
aVhave very little value.
p93
aVBut actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.
p94
aVAnd there's more plastics produced and consumed
p95
aVaround the world on a volume basis
p96
aVevery year than steel.
p97
aVSo why is such a plentiful and valuable material
p98
aVnot recovered at anywhere near the rate
p99
aVof the less valuable material?
p100
aVWell it's predominantly because
p101
aVmetals are very easy to recycle
p102
aVfrom other materials and from one another.
p103
aVThey have very different densities.
p104
aVThey have different electrical and magnetic properties.
p105
aVAnd they even have different colors.
p106
aVSo it's very easy for either humans or machines
p107
aVto separate these metals
p108
aVfrom one another and from other materials.
p109
aVPlastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.
p110
aVThey have either identical or very similar
p111
aVelectrical and magnetic properties.
p112
aVAnd any plastic can be any color,
p113
aVas you probably well know.
p114
aVSo the traditional ways of separating materials
p115
aVjust simply don't work for plastics.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnother consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans
p118
aVis that a lot of our stuff from the developed world \u2014
p119
aVand sadly to say, particularly from the United States,
p120
aVwhere we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe \u2014
p121
aVfinds its way to developing countries
p122
aVfor low-cost recycling.
p123
aVPeople, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.
p124
aVThey extract what they can, which is mostly the metals \u2014
p125
aVcircuit boards and so forth \u2014
p126
aVand they leave behind mostly what they can't recover,
p127
aVwhich is, again, mostly the plastics.
p128
aVOr they burn the plastics to get to the metals
p129
aVin burn houses like you see here.
p130
aVAnd they extract the metals by hand.
p131
aVNow while this may be the low-economic-cost solution,
p132
aVthis is certainly not the low-environmental
p133
aVor human health-and-safety solution.
p134
aVI call this environmental arbitrage.
p135
aVAnd it's not fair, it's not safe
p136
aVand it's not sustainable.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow because the plastics are so plentiful \u2014
p139
aVand by the way,
p140
aVthose other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously \u2014
p141
aVbut people do try to recover the plastics.
p142
aVThis is just one example.
p143
aVThis is a photo I took standing on the rooftops
p144
aVof one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.
p145
aVThey store the plastics on the roofs.
p146
aVThey bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these,
p147
aVand people try very hard to separate the plastics,
p148
aVby color, by shape, by feel,
p149
aVby any technique they can.
p150
aVAnd sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique
p151
aVwhere they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes
p152
aVto try to determine the type of plastic.
p153
aVNone of these techniques result in any amount of recycling
p154
aVin any significant way.
p155
aVAnd by the way,
p156
aVplease don't try this technique at home.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo what are we to do about this space-age material,
p159
aVat least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?
p160
aVWell I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant
p161
aVto keep putting back in the ground
p162
aVor certainly send up in smoke.
p163
aVSo about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around,
p164
aVtrying to figure out how to separate
p165
aVthese very similar materials from each other,
p166
aVand eventually enlisted a lot of my friends,
p167
aVin the mining world actually, and in the plastics world,
p168
aVand we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.
p169
aVBecause after all, we're doing above-ground mining.
p170
aVAnd we eventually broke the code.
p171
aVThis is the last frontier of recycling.
p172
aVIt's the last major material
p173
aVto be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.
p174
aVAnd we finally figured out how to do it.
p175
aVAnd in the process, we started recreating
p176
aVhow the plastics industry makes plastics.
p177
aa(lp178
VThe traditional way to make plastics
p179
aVis with oil or petrochemicals.
p180
aVYou breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways,
p181
aVto make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.
p182
aVWe said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.
p183
aVAnd not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint,
p184
aVsustainable from an economic standpoint as well.
p185
aVWell a good place to start is with waste.
p186
aVIt certainly doesn't cost as much as oil,
p187
aVand it's plentiful,
p188
aVas I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.
p189
aVAnd because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules
p190
aVand recombining them,
p191
aVwe're using a mining approach to extract the materials.
p192
aa(lp193
VWe have significantly lower capital costs
p194
aVin our plant equipment.
p195
aVWe have enormous energy savings.
p196
aVI don't know how many other projects on the planet right now
p197
aVcan save 80 to 90 percent of the energy
p198
aVcompared to making something the traditional way.
p199
aVAnd instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars
p200
aVto build a chemical plant
p201
aVthat will only make one type of plastic for its entire life,
p202
aVour plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.
p203
aVAnd we make a drop-in replacement
p204
aVfor that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.
p205
aVOur customers get to enjoy
p206
aVhuge CO2 savings.
p207
aVThey get to close the loop with their products.
p208
aVAnd they get to make more sustainable products.
p209
aa(lp210
VIn the short time period I have,
p211
aVI want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.
p212
aVIt starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.
p213
aVThey recover the metals
p214
aVand leave behind what's called shredder residue \u2014 it's their waste \u2014
p215
aVa very complex mixture of materials,
p216
aVbut predominantly plastics.
p217
aVWe take out the things that aren't plastics,
p218
aVsuch as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber,
p219
aVwood, glass, paper, you name it.
p220
aVEven an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.
p221
aVAnd it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.
p222
aVWe're sieving the material, we're using magnets,
p223
aVwe're using air classification.
p224
aVIt looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.
p225
aa(lp226
VAt the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite:
p227
aVmany different types of plastics
p228
aVand many different grades of plastics.
p229
aVThis goes into the more sophisticated part of our process,
p230
aVand the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.
p231
aVWe grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.
p232
aVWe use a very highly automated process
p233
aVto sort those plastics,
p234
aVnot only by type, but by grade.
p235
aVAnd out the end of that part of the process
p236
aVcome little flakes of plastic:
p237
aVone type, one grade.
p238
aVWe then use optical sorting to color sort this material.
p239
aVWe blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.
p240
aVWe push that material to extruders where we melt it,
p241
aVpush it through small die holes,
p242
aVmake spaghetti-like plastic strands.
p243
aVAnd we chop those strands
p244
aVinto what are called pellets.
p245
aVAnd this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.
p246
aVThis is the same material
p247
aVthat you would get from oil.
p248
aVAnd today,
p249
aVwe're producing it from your old stuff,
p250
aVand it's going right back into your new stuff.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VSo now, instead of your stuff ending up
p255
aVon a hillside in a developing country
p256
aVor literally going up in smoke,
p257
aVyou can find your old stuff
p258
aVback on top of your desk in new products,
p259
aVin your office,
p260
aVor back at work in your home.
p261
aVAnd these are just a few examples
p262
aVof companies that are buying our plastic,
p263
aVreplacing virgin plastic,
p264
aVto make their new products.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo I hope I've changed the way you look at
p267
aVat least some of the stuff in your life.
p268
aVWe took our clues from mother nature.
p269
aVMother nature wastes very little,
p270
aVreuses practically everything.
p271
aVAnd I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer \u2014
p272
aVthat's a label I've always hated my entire life \u2014
p273
aVand think of yourself as just using resources in one form,
p274
aVuntil they can be transformed to another form
p275
aVfor another use later in time.
p276
aVAnd finally, I hope you agree with me
p277
aVto change that last toddler rule just a little bit
p278
aVto: "If it's broken, it's my stuff."
p279
aa(lp280
VThank you for your time.
p281
aa(lp282

Because it&rsquo;s so difficult to separate the various kinds of plastics &ndash; up to 20 kinds per product &ndash; that make up our computers, cell phones, cars and home appliances, only a small fraction of plastics from complex waste streams are recycled, while the rest is tossed. In 1992, Mike Biddle, a plastics engineer, set out to find a solution. He set up a lab in his garage in Pittsburg, California, and began experimenting with complex-plastics recycling, borrowing ideas from such industries as mining and grain processing. <br /><br />Since then, Biddle has developed a patented 30-step plastics recycling system that includes magnetically extracting metals, shredding the plastics, sorting them by polymer type and producing graded pellets to be reused in industry &ndash;&nbsp;a process that takes less than a tenth of the energy required to make virgin plastic from crude oil. Today, the company he cofounded, <a href=\\"http://mbapolymers.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MBA Polymers</a>, has plants in China and Austria, and plans to build more in Europe, where electronics-waste regulation (which doesn&rsquo;t yet have an equivalent in the US) already ensures a stream of materials to exploit &ndash; a process Biddle calls &ldquo;above-ground mining.&rdquo;</p><p>He says: &quot;I consider myself an environmentalist. I hate to see plastics wasted. I hate to see any natural resource &ndash; even human time &ndash; wasted.&rdquo; </p>", "slug": "michael_biddle", "whotheyare": "Discarded plastic, too often, ends up buried or burned, not recycled (it\'s just too complicated).

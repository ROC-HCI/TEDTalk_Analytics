VThe universe is teeming with planets.
p5
aVI want us, in the next decade,
p6
aVto build a space telescope that'll be able to image
p7
aVan Earth about another star
p8
aVand figure out whether it can harbor life.
p9
aVMy colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
p10
aVat Princeton and I are working on technology
p11
aVthat will be able to do just that in the coming years.
p12
aVAstronomers now believe that every star
p13
aVin the galaxy has a planet,
p14
aVand they speculate that up to one fifth of them
p15
aVhave an Earth-like planet
p16
aVthat might be able to harbor life,
p17
aVbut we haven't seen any of them.
p18
aVWe've only detected them indirectly.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot.
p21
aVIt was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990,
p22
aVwhen they turned it around as it was exiting the solar system
p23
aVto take a picture of the Earth
p24
aVfrom six billion kilometers away.
p25
aVI want to take that
p26
aVof an Earth-like planet about another star.
p27
aa(lp28
VWhy haven't we done that? Why is that hard?
p29
aVWell to see, let's imagine we take
p30
aVthe Hubble Space Telescope
p31
aVand we turn it around and we move it out
p32
aVto the orbit of Mars.
p33
aVWe'll see something like that,
p34
aVa slightly blurry picture of the Earth,
p35
aVbecause we're a fairly small telescope
p36
aVout at the orbit of Mars.
p37
aVNow let's move ten times further away.
p38
aVHere we are at the orbit of Uranus.
p39
aVIt's gotten smaller, it's got less detail, less resolve.
p40
aVWe can still see the little moon,
p41
aVbut let's go ten times further away again.
p42
aVHere we are at the edge of the solar system,
p43
aVout at the Kuiper Belt.
p44
aVNow it's not resolved at all.
p45
aVIt's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's.
p46
aVBut let's move yet again ten times further away.
p47
aVHere we are out at the Oort Cloud,
p48
aVoutside the solar system,
p49
aVand we're starting to see the sun
p50
aVmove into the field of view
p51
aVand get into where the planet is.
p52
aVOne more time, ten times further away.
p53
aVNow we're at Alpha Centauri,
p54
aVour nearest neighbor star,
p55
aVand the planet is gone.
p56
aVAll we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star
p57
aVthat's ten billion times brighter than the planet,
p58
aVwhich should be in that little red circle.
p59
aVThat's what we want to see. That's why it's hard.
p60
aVThe light from the star is diffracting.
p61
aVIt's scattering inside the telescope,
p62
aVcreating that very bright image
p63
aVthat washes out the planet.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo to see the planet,
p66
aVwe have to do something about all of that light.
p67
aVWe have to get rid of it.
p68
aVI have a lot of colleagues working on
p69
aVreally amazing technologies to do that,
p70
aVbut I want to tell you about one today
p71
aVthat I think is the coolest,
p72
aVand probably the most likely to get us an Earth
p73
aVin the next decade.
p74
aa(lp75
VIt was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer,
p76
aVthe father of the space telescope, in 1962,
p77
aVand he took his inspiration from an eclipse.
p78
aVYou've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse.
p79
aVThe moon has moved in front of the sun.
p80
aVIt blocks out most of the light
p81
aVso we can see that dim corona around it.
p82
aVIt would be the same thing if I put my thumb up
p83
aVand blocked that spotlight that's getting right in my eye,
p84
aVI can see you in the back row.
p85
aVWell, what's going on?
p86
aVWell the moon
p87
aVis casting a shadow down on the Earth.
p88
aVWe put a telescope or a camera in that shadow,
p89
aVwe look back at the sun,
p90
aVand most of the light's been removed
p91
aVand we can see that dim, fine structure
p92
aVin the corona.
p93
aVSpitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.
p94
aVWe build a big screen, we fly it in space,
p95
aVwe put it up in front of the star,
p96
aVwe block out most of the light,
p97
aVwe fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created,
p98
aVand boom, we get to see planets.
p99
aVWell that would look something like this.
p100
aVSo there's that big screen,
p101
aVand there's no planets,
p102
aVbecause unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well,
p103
aVbecause the light waves of the light and waves
p104
aVdiffracts around that screen
p105
aVthe same way it did in the telescope.
p106
aVIt's like water bending around a rock in a stream,
p107
aVand all that light just destroys the shadow.
p108
aVIt's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut Spitzer actually knew the answer.
p111
aVIf we can feather the edges, soften those edges
p112
aVso we can control diffraction,
p113
aVwell then we can see a planet,
p114
aVand in the last 10 years or so we've come up
p115
aVwith optimal solutions for doing that.
p116
aVIt looks something like that.
p117
aVWe call that our flower petal starshade.
p118
aVIf we make the edges of those petals exactly right,
p119
aVif we control their shape,
p120
aVwe can control diffraction,
p121
aVand now we have a great shadow.
p122
aVIt's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before,
p123
aVand we can see the planets beam out just like that.
p124
aVThat, of course, has to be bigger than my thumb.
p125
aVThat starshade is about
p126
aVthe size of half a football field
p127
aVand it has to fly 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope
p128
aVthat has to be held right in its shadow,
p129
aVand then we can see those planets.
p130
aa(lp131
VThis sounds formidable,
p132
aVbut brilliant engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL,
p133
aVcame up with a fabulous design for how to do that
p134
aVand it looks like this.
p135
aVIt starts wrapped around a hub.
p136
aVIt separates from the telescope.
p137
aVThe petals unfurl, they open up,
p138
aVthe telescope turns around.
p139
aVThen you'll see it flip and fly out
p140
aVthat 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope.
p141
aVIt's going to move in front of the star
p142
aVjust like that, creates a wonderful shadow.
p143
aVBoom, we get planets orbiting about it.
p144
aV(Applause)
p145
aVThank you.
p146
aa(lp147
VThat's not science fiction.
p148
aVWe've been working on this for the last five or six years.
p149
aVLast summer, we did a really cool test
p150
aVout in California at Northrop Grumman.
p151
aVSo those are four petals.
p152
aVThis is a sub-scale star shade.
p153
aVIt's about half the size of the one you just saw.
p154
aVYou'll see the petals unfurl.
p155
aVThose four petals were built by four undergraduates
p156
aVdoing a summer internship at JPL.
p157
aVNow you're seeing it deploy.
p158
aVThose petals have to rotate into place.
p159
aVThe base of those petals
p160
aVhas to go to the same place every time
p161
aVto within a tenth of a millimeter.
p162
aVWe ran this test 16 times,
p163
aVand 16 times it went into the exact same place
p164
aVto a tenth of a millimeter.
p165
aVThis has to be done very precisely,
p166
aVbut if we can do this, if we can build this technology,
p167
aVif we can get it into space,
p168
aVyou might see something like this.
p169
aVThat's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars
p170
aVtaken with the Hubble Space Telescope.
p171
aVIf we can take a similar space telescope,
p172
aVslightly larger,
p173
aVput it out there,
p174
aVfly an occulter in front of it,
p175
aVwhat we might see is something like that \u2014
p176
aVthat's a family portrait of our solar system \u2014 but not ours.
p177
aVWe're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system
p178
aVas seen through an occulter,
p179
aVthrough a starshade like that.
p180
aVYou can see Jupiter, you can see Saturn,
p181
aVUranus, Neptune, and right there in the center,
p182
aVnext to the residual light
p183
aVis that pale blue dot. That's Earth.
p184
aVWe want to see that, see if there's water,
p185
aVoxygen, ozone,
p186
aVthe things that might tell us that it could harbor life.
p187
aa(lp188
VI think this is the coolest possible science.
p189
aVThat's why I got into doing this,
p190
aVbecause I think that will change the world.
p191
aVThat will change everything when we see that.
p192
aa(lp193
VThank you.

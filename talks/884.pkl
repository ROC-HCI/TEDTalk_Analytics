VSo since I was here last in '06,
p5
aVwe discovered that global climate change
p6
aVis turning out to be a pretty serious issue,
p7
aVso we covered that fairly extensively
p8
aVin Skeptic magazine.
p9
aVWe investigate all kinds
p10
aVof scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,
p11
aVbut it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this
p12
aVbecause the world's going to end in 2012.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnother update:
p15
aVYou will recall I introduced you guys
p16
aVto the Quadro Tracker.
p17
aVIt's like a water dowsing device.
p18
aVIt's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.
p19
aVAnd you walk around, and it points to things.
p20
aVLike if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers,
p21
aVit'll point right to somebody.
p22
aVOh, sorry. (Laughter)
p23
aVThis particular one that was given to me
p24
aVfinds golf balls,
p25
aVespecially if you're at a golf course
p26
aVand you check under enough bushes.
p27
aVWell, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?"
p28
aVthis device, the ADE 651,
p29
aVwas sold to the Iraqi government
p30
aVfor 40,000 dollars apiece.
p31
aVIt's just like this one, completely worthless,
p32
aVin which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic
p33
aVmagnetic ion attraction,"
p34
aVwhich translates to
p35
aV"pseudoscientific baloney" \u2014 would be the nice word \u2014
p36
aVin which you string together a bunch of words that sound good,
p37
aVbut it does absolutely nothing.
p38
aVIn this case, at trespass points,
p39
aVallowing people to go through
p40
aVbecause your little tracker device said they were okay,
p41
aVactually cost lives.
p42
aVSo there is a danger to pseudoscience,
p43
aVin believing in this sort of thing.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo what I want to talk about today is belief.
p46
aVI want to believe,
p47
aVand you do too.
p48
aVAnd in fact, I think my thesis here is that
p49
aVbelief is the natural state of things.
p50
aVIt is the default option. We just believe.
p51
aVWe believe all sorts of things.
p52
aVBelief is natural;
p53
aVdisbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.
p54
aVIt's more difficult.
p55
aVIt's uncomfortable to not believe things.
p56
aVSo like Fox Mulder on "X-Files,"
p57
aVwho wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do,
p58
aVand the reason for that is because
p59
aVwe have a belief engine in our brains.
p60
aVEssentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.
p61
aVWe connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C.
p62
aVAnd sometimes A really is connected to B,
p63
aVand that's called association learning.
p64
aa(lp65
VWe find patterns, we make those connections,
p66
aVwhether it's Pavlov's dog here
p67
aVassociating the sound of the bell with the food,
p68
aVand then he salivates to the sound of the bell,
p69
aVor whether it's a Skinnerian rat,
p70
aVin which he's having an association
p71
aVbetween his behavior and a reward for it,
p72
aVand therefore he repeats the behavior.
p73
aVIn fact, what Skinner discovered
p74
aVis that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this,
p75
aVand he has to press one of these two keys,
p76
aVand he tries to figure out what the pattern is,
p77
aVand you give him a little reward in the hopper box there \u2014
p78
aVif you just randomly assign rewards
p79
aVsuch that there is no pattern,
p80
aVthey will figure out any kind of pattern.
p81
aVAnd whatever they were doing just before they got the reward,
p82
aVthey repeat that particular pattern.
p83
aVSometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise,
p84
aVonce clockwise and peck the key twice.
p85
aVAnd that's called superstition,
p86
aVand that, I'm afraid,
p87
aVwe will always have with us.
p88
aa(lp89
VI call this process "patternicity" \u2014
p90
aVthat is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns
p91
aVin both meaningful and meaningless noise.
p92
aVWhen we do this process, we make two types of errors.
p93
aVA Type I error, or false positive,
p94
aVis believing a pattern is real
p95
aVwhen it's not.
p96
aVOur second type of error is a false negative.
p97
aVA Type II error is not believing
p98
aVa pattern is real when it is.
p99
aVSo let's do a thought experiment.
p100
aVYou are a hominid three million years ago
p101
aVwalking on the plains of Africa.
p102
aVYour name is Lucy, okay?
p103
aVAnd you hear a rustle in the grass.
p104
aVIs it a dangerous predator,
p105
aVor is it just the wind?
p106
aVYour next decision could be the most important one of your life.
p107
aVWell, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator
p108
aVand it turns out it's just the wind,
p109
aVyou've made an error in cognition,
p110
aVmade a Type I error, false positive.
p111
aVBut no harm. You just move away.
p112
aVYou're more cautious. You're more vigilant.
p113
aVOn the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind,
p114
aVand it turns out it's a dangerous predator,
p115
aVyou're lunch.
p116
aVYou've just won a Darwin award.
p117
aVYou've been taken out of the gene pool.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow the problem here is that
p120
aVpatternicities will occur whenever the cost
p121
aVof making a Type I error
p122
aVis less than the cost of making a Type II error.
p123
aVThis is the only equation in the talk by the way.
p124
aVWe have a pattern detection problem
p125
aVthat is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error
p126
aVis highly problematic,
p127
aVespecially in split-second, life-and-death situations.
p128
aVSo the default position
p129
aVis just: Believe all patterns are real \u2014
p130
aVAll rustles in the grass are dangerous predators
p131
aVand not just the wind.
p132
aVAnd so I think that we evolved ...
p133
aVthere was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines,
p134
aVour pattern-seeking brain processes,
p135
aVto always find meaningful patterns
p136
aVand infuse them with these sort of
p137
aVpredatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo for example, what do you see here?
p140
aVIt's a horse head, that's right.
p141
aVIt looks like a horse. It must be a horse.
p142
aVThat's a pattern.
p143
aVAnd is it really a horse?
p144
aVOr is it more like a frog?
p145
aVSee, our pattern detection device,
p146
aVwhich appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex \u2014
p147
aVit's our little detection device there \u2014
p148
aVcan be easily fooled, and this is the problem.
p149
aVFor example, what do you see here?
p150
aVYes, of course, it's a cow.
p151
aVOnce I prime the brain \u2014 it's called cognitive priming \u2014
p152
aVonce I prime the brain to see it,
p153
aVit pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it.
p154
aVAnd what do you see here?
p155
aVSome people see a Dalmatian dog.
p156
aVYes, there it is. And there's the prime.
p157
aVSo when I go back without the prime,
p158
aVyour brain already has the model
p159
aVso you can see it again.
p160
aVWhat do you see here?
p161
aVPlanet Saturn. Yes, that's good.
p162
aVHow about here?
p163
aVJust shout out anything you see.
p164
aVThat's a good audience, Chris.
p165
aVBecause there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing.
p166
aa(lp167
VThis is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson
p168
aVat U.T. Austin
p169
aVon corporate environments
p170
aVand whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control
p171
aVmakes people see illusory patterns.
p172
aVThat is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.
p173
aVPeople that are put in a condition of feeling out of control
p174
aVare more likely to see something in this,
p175
aVwhich is allegedly patternless.
p176
aVIn other words, the propensity to find these patterns
p177
aVgoes up when there's a lack of control.
p178
aVFor example, baseball players are notoriously superstitious
p179
aVwhen they're batting,
p180
aVbut not so much when they're fielding.
p181
aVBecause fielders are successful
p182
aV90 to 95 percent of the time.
p183
aVThe best batters fail seven out of 10 times.
p184
aVSo their superstitions, their patternicities,
p185
aVare all associated with feelings of lack of control
p186
aVand so forth.
p187
aa(lp188
VWhat do you see in this particular one here, in this field?
p189
aVAnybody see an object there?
p190
aVThere actually is something here,
p191
aVbut it's degraded.
p192
aVWhile you're thinking about that,
p193
aVthis was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore,
p194
aVa psychologist in England,
p195
aVwho showed subjects this degraded image
p196
aVand then ran a correlation between
p197
aVtheir scores on an ESP test:
p198
aVHow much did they believe in the paranormal,
p199
aVsupernatural, angels and so forth.
p200
aVAnd those who scored high on the ESP scale,
p201
aVtended to not only see
p202
aVmore patterns in the degraded images
p203
aVbut incorrect patterns.
p204
aVHere is what you show subjects.
p205
aVThe fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent
p206
aVand then the one I showed you,
p207
aV70 percent.
p208
aa(lp209
VA similar experiment was done by another [Swiss] psychologist
p210
aVnamed Peter Brugger,
p211
aVwho found significantly more meaningful patterns
p212
aVwere perceived on the right hemisphere,
p213
aVvia the left visual field, than the left hemisphere.
p214
aVSo if you present subjects the images such
p215
aVthat it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left,
p216
aVthen they're more likely to see patterns
p217
aVthan if you put it on the left hemisphere.
p218
aVOur right hemisphere appears to be
p219
aVwhere a lot of this patternicity occurs.
p220
aVSo what we're trying to do is bore into the brain
p221
aVto see where all this happens.
p222
aa(lp223
VBrugger and his colleague, Christine Mohr,
p224
aVgave subjects L-DOPA.
p225
aVL-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease,
p226
aVwhich is related to a decrease in dopamine.
p227
aVL-DOPA increases dopamine.
p228
aVAn increase of dopamine caused
p229
aVsubjects to see more patterns
p230
aVthan those that did not receive the dopamine.
p231
aVSo dopamine appears to be the drug
p232
aVassociated with patternicity.
p233
aVIn fact, neuroleptic drugs
p234
aVthat are used to eliminate psychotic behavior,
p235
aVthings like paranoia, delusions
p236
aVand hallucinations,
p237
aVthese are patternicities.
p238
aVThey're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors.
p239
aVAnd if you give them drugs
p240
aVthat are dopamine antagonists,
p241
aVthey go away.
p242
aVThat is, you decrease the amount of dopamine,
p243
aVand their tendency to see
p244
aVpatterns like that decreases.
p245
aVOn the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine
p246
aVare dopamine agonists.
p247
aVThey increase the amount of dopamine.
p248
aVSo you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state,
p249
aVcreativity, find more patterns.
p250
aa(lp251
VIn fact, I saw Robin Williams recently
p252
aVtalk about how he thought he was much funnier
p253
aVwhen he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now.
p254
aVSo perhaps more dopamine
p255
aVis related to more creativity.
p256
aVDopamine, I think, changes
p257
aVour signal-to-noise ratio.
p258
aVThat is, how accurate we are
p259
aVin finding patterns.
p260
aVIf it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors.
p261
aVYou miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical.
p262
aVIf you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas.
p263
aVJust right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney.
p264
aVToo high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.
p265
aVEvery time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you.
p266
aVYou think people are talking about you.
p267
aVAnd if you go too far on that, that's just simply
p268
aVlabeled as madness.
p269
aVIt's a distinction perhaps we might make
p270
aVbetween two Nobel laureates, Richard Feynman
p271
aVand John Nash.
p272
aVOne sees maybe just the right number
p273
aVof patterns to win a Nobel Prize.
p274
aVThe other one also, but maybe too many patterns.
p275
aVAnd we then call that schizophrenia.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem.
p278
aVAnd of course you all know exactly
p279
aVwhat this is, right?
p280
aVAnd what pattern do you see here?
p281
aVAgain, I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here,
p282
aVcausing you conflicting pattern detections.
p283
aVYou know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes.
p284
aVThese are sandals.
p285
aVPretty sexy feet, I must say.
p286
aVMaybe a little Photoshopped.
p287
aVAnd of course, the ambiguous figures
p288
aVthat seem to flip-flop back and forth.
p289
aVIt turns out what you're thinking about a lot
p290
aVinfluences what you
p291
aVtend to see.
p292
aVAnd you see the lamp here, I know.
p293
aVBecause the lights on here.
p294
aVOf course, thanks to the environmentalist movement
p295
aVwe're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals.
p296
aVSo what you see in this particular ambiguous figure
p297
aVis, of course, the dolphins, right?
p298
aVYou see a dolphin here,
p299
aVand there's a dolphin,
p300
aVand there's a dolphin.
p301
aVThat's a dolphin tail there, guys.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VIf we can give you conflicting data, again,
p306
aVyour ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive.
p307
aVIf you look down here, it's fine. If you look up here, then you get conflicting data.
p308
aVAnd then we have to flip the image
p309
aVfor you to see that it's a set up.
p310
aVThe impossible crate illusion.
p311
aVIt's easy to fool the brain in 2D.
p312
aVSo you say, "Aw, come on Shermer, anybody can do that
p313
aVin a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that."
p314
aVWell here's the late, great Jerry Andrus'
p315
aV"impossible crate" illusion in 3D,
p316
aVin which Jerry is standing inside
p317
aVthe impossible crate.
p318
aVAnd he was kind enough to post this
p319
aVand give us the reveal.
p320
aVOf course, camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there,
p321
aVand this board appears to overlap with this one, and this one with that one, and so on.
p322
aVBut even when I take it away,
p323
aVthe illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired
p324
aVto find those certain kinds of patterns.
p325
aa(lp326
VThis is a fairly new one
p327
aVthat throws us off because of the conflicting patterns
p328
aVof comparing this angle with that angle.
p329
aVIn fact, it's the exact same picture side by side.
p330
aVSo what you're doing is comparing that angle
p331
aVinstead of with this one, but with that one.
p332
aVAnd so your brain is fooled.
p333
aVYet again, your pattern detection devices are fooled.
p334
aa(lp335
VFaces are easy to see
p336
aVbecause we have an additional evolved
p337
aVfacial recognition software
p338
aVin our temporal lobes.
p339
aVHere's some faces on the side of a rock.
p340
aVI'm actually not even sure if this is \u2014 this might be Photoshopped.
p341
aVBut anyway, the point is still made.
p342
aVNow which one of these looks odd to you?
p343
aVIn a quick reaction, which one looks odd?
p344
aVThe one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it
p345
aVso it'll be the one on the right.
p346
aVAnd you are correct.
p347
aVA fairly famous illusion \u2014 it was first done with Margaret Thatcher.
p348
aVNow, they trade up the politicians every time.
p349
aVWell, why is this happening?
p350
aVWell, we know exactly where it happens,
p351
aVin the temporal lobe, right across, sort of above your ear there,
p352
aVin a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.
p353
aVAnd there's two types of cells that do this,
p354
aVthat record facial features either globally,
p355
aVor specifically these large, rapid-firing cells,
p356
aVfirst look at the general face.
p357
aVSo you recognize Obama immediately.
p358
aVAnd then you notice something quite
p359
aVa little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth.
p360
aVEspecially when they're upside down,
p361
aVyou're engaging that general facial recognition software there.
p362
aa(lp363
VNow I said back in our little thought experiment,
p364
aVyou're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa.
p365
aVIs it just the wind or a dangerous predator?
p366
aVWhat's the difference between those?
p367
aVWell, the wind is inanimate;
p368
aVthe dangerous predator is an intentional agent.
p369
aVAnd I call this process agenticity.
p370
aVThat is the tendency to infuse patterns
p371
aVwith meaning, intention and agency,
p372
aVoften invisible beings from the top down.
p373
aVThis is an idea that we got
p374
aVfrom a fellow TEDster here, Dan Dennett,
p375
aVwho talked about taking the intentional stance.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo it's a type of that expanded to explain, I think, a lot of different things:
p378
aVsouls, spirits, ghosts, gods, demons, angels,
p379
aValiens, intelligent designers,
p380
aVgovernment conspiracists
p381
aVand all manner of invisible agents
p382
aVwith power and intention, are believed
p383
aVto haunt our world and control our lives.
p384
aVI think it's the basis of animism
p385
aVand polytheism and monotheism.
p386
aVIt's the belief that aliens are somehow
p387
aVmore advanced than us, more moral than us,
p388
aVand the narratives always are
p389
aVthat they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high.
p390
aVThe intelligent designer's always portrayed
p391
aVas this super intelligent, moral being
p392
aVthat comes down to design life.
p393
aVEven the idea that government can rescue us \u2014
p394
aVthat's no longer the wave of the future,
p395
aVbut that is, I think, a type of agenticity:
p396
aVprojecting somebody up there,
p397
aVbig and powerful, will come rescue us.
p398
aa(lp399
VAnd this is also, I think, the basis of conspiracy theories.
p400
aVThere's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings,
p401
aVwhether it's the Illuminati
p402
aVor the Bilderbergers.
p403
aVBut this is a pattern detection problem, isn't it?
p404
aVSome patterns are real and some are not.
p405
aVWas JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin?
p406
aVWell, if you go there \u2014 there's people there on any given day \u2014
p407
aVlike when I went there, here \u2014 showing me where the different shooters were.
p408
aVMy favorite one was he was in the manhole.
p409
aVAnd he popped out at the last second, took that shot.
p410
aVBut of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy.
p411
aVSo we can't just uniformly dismiss
p412
aVall patterns like that.
p413
aVBecause, let's face it, some patterns are real.
p414
aVSome conspiracies really are true.
p415
aVExplains a lot, maybe.
p416
aa(lp417
VAnd 9/11 has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy.
p418
aVWe did a whole issue on it.
p419
aVNineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings
p420
aVconstitutes a conspiracy.
p421
aVBut that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.
p422
aVThey think it was an inside job by the Bush administration.
p423
aVWell, that's a whole other lecture.
p424
aVYou know how we know that 9/11
p425
aVwas not orchestrated by the Bush administration?
p426
aVBecause it worked.
p427
aa(lp428
V(Laughter)
p429
aa(lp430
V(Applause)
p431
aa(lp432
VSo we are natural-born dualists.
p433
aVOur agenticity process comes from
p434
aVthe fact that we can enjoy movies like these.
p435
aVBecause we can imagine, in essence,
p436
aVcontinuing on.
p437
aVWe know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe,
p438
aVyou can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences,
p439
aVnear-death experiences,
p440
aVwhich you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there.
p441
aVOr you can do it through loss of consciousness,
p442
aVby accelerating in a centrifuge.
p443
aVYou get a hypoxia, or a lower oxygen.
p444
aVAnd the brain then senses
p445
aVthat there's an out-of-body experience.
p446
aVYou can use \u2014 which I did, went out and did \u2014
p447
aVMichael Persinger's God Helmet,
p448
aVthat bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves.
p449
aVAnd you get a sense of out-of-body experience.
p450
aa(lp451
VSo I'm going to end here with a short video clip
p452

VI'm actually here
p5
aVto make a challenge to people.
p6
aVI know there have been many challenges made to people.
p7
aVThe one I'm going to make
p8
aVis that it is time for us to reclaim
p9
aVwhat peace really means.
p10
aVPeace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord."
p11
aVPeace is not the dove and the rainbow \u2014
p12
aVas lovely as they are.
p13
aVWhen I see the symbols
p14
aVof the rainbow and the dove,
p15
aVI think of personal serenity.
p16
aVI think of meditation.
p17
aVI do not think
p18
aVabout what I consider to be peace,
p19
aVwhich is sustainable peace
p20
aVwith justice and equality.
p21
aVIt is a sustainable peace
p22
aVin which the majority of people
p23
aVon this planet
p24
aVhave access to enough resources
p25
aVto live dignified lives,
p26
aVwhere these people have enough access
p27
aVto education
p28
aVand health care,
p29
aVso that they can live in freedom from want
p30
aVand freedom from fear.
p31
aVThis is called human security.
p32
aVAnd I am not a complete pacifist
p33
aVlike some of my really, really heavy-duty,
p34
aVnon-violent friends,
p35
aVlike Mairead McGuire.
p36
aVI understand that humans
p37
aVare so "messed up" \u2014
p38
aVto use a nice word,
p39
aVbecause I promised my mom
p40
aVI'd stop using the F-bomb in public.
p41
aVAnd I'm trying harder and harder.
p42
aVMom, I'm really trying.
p43
aa(lp44
VWe need a little bit of police;
p45
aVwe need a little bit of military,
p46
aVbut for defense.
p47
aVWe need to redefine
p48
aVwhat makes us secure
p49
aVin this world.
p50
aVIt is not arming our country
p51
aVto the teeth.
p52
aVIt is not getting other countries
p53
aVto arm themselves to the teeth
p54
aVwith the weapons that we produce
p55
aVand we sell them.
p56
aVIt is using that money more rationally
p57
aVto make the countries of the world secure,
p58
aVto make the people of the world secure.
p59
aVI was thinking about
p60
aVthe recent ongoings
p61
aVin Congress,
p62
aVwhere the president is offering
p63
aV8.4 billion dollars
p64
aVto try to get the START vote.
p65
aVI certainly support the START vote.
p66
aVBut he's offering 84 billion dollars
p67
aVfor the modernizing
p68
aVof nuclear weapons.
p69
aVDo you know the figure that the U.N. talks about
p70
aVfor fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals
p71
aVis 80 billion dollars?
p72
aVJust that little bit of money,
p73
aVwhich to me, I wish it was in my bank account \u2014
p74
aVit's not, but ...
p75
aVIn global terms, it's a little bit of money.
p76
aVBut it's going to modernize weapons
p77
aVwe do not need
p78
aVand will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime,
p79
aVunless we get up off our ...
p80
aVand take action to make it happen,
p81
aVunless we begin to believe
p82
aVthat all of the things that we've been hearing about
p83
aVin these last two days
p84
aVare elements of what come together
p85
aVto make human security.
p86
aVIt is saving the tigers.
p87
aVIt is stopping the tar sands.
p88
aVIt is having access
p89
aVto medical equipment
p90
aVthat can actually tell who does have cancer.
p91
aVIt is all of those things.
p92
aVIt is using our money for all of those things.
p93
aVIt is about action.
p94
aa(lp95
VI was in Hiroshima
p96
aVa couple of weeks ago,
p97
aVand His Holiness \u2014
p98
aVwe're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city,
p99
aVand there were about eight of us Nobel laureates.
p100
aVAnd he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church.
p101
aVWe're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak,
p102
aVand he leans over to me, and he says,
p103
aV"Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk."
p104
aVI said, "Yes, Your Holiness.
p105
aVYour robe gives it away."
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVHe said, "You know
p108
aVthat I kind of like meditation, and I pray."
p109
aVI said, "That's good. That's good.
p110
aVWe need that in the world.
p111
aVI don't follow that, but that's cool."
p112
aVAnd he says, "But I have become skeptical.
p113
aVI do not believe
p114
aVthat meditation and prayer
p115
aVwill change this world.
p116
aVI think what we need
p117
aVis action."
p118
aVHis Holiness, in his robes,
p119
aVis my new action hero.
p120
aa(lp121
VI spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi
p122
aVa couple of days ago.
p123
aVAs most of you know,
p124
aVshe's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma.
p125
aVYou probably also know
p126
aVthat she has spent 15 of the last 20 years
p127
aVimprisoned for her efforts
p128
aVto bring about democracy.
p129
aVShe was just released a couple of weeks ago,
p130
aVand we're very concerned to see how long she will be free,
p131
aVbecause she is already out in the streets in Rangoon,
p132
aVagitating for change.
p133
aVShe is already out in the streets, working with the party
p134
aVto try to rebuild it.
p135
aVBut I talked to her for a range of issues.
p136
aVBut one thing that I want to say,
p137
aVbecause it's similar to what His Holiness said.
p138
aVShe said, "You know, we have a long road to go
p139
aVto finally get democracy in my country.
p140
aVBut I don't believe in hope
p141
aVwithout endeavor.
p142
aVI don't believe in the hope of change,
p143
aVunless we take action
p144
aVto make it so."
p145
aa(lp146
VHere's another woman hero of mine.
p147
aVShe's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi,
p148
aVthe first Muslim woman
p149
aVto receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
p150
aVShe has been in exile
p151
aVfor the last year and a half.
p152
aVYou ask her where she lives \u2014 where does she live in exile?
p153
aVShe says the airports of the world.
p154
aVShe is traveling because she was out of the country
p155
aVat the time of the elections.
p156
aVAnd instead of going home,
p157
aVshe conferred with all the other women that she works with,
p158
aVwho said to her, "Stay out. We need you out.
p159
aVWe need to be able to talk to you out there,
p160
aVso that you can give the message
p161
aVof what's happening here."
p162
aVA year and a half \u2014
p163
aVshe's out speaking
p164
aVon behalf of the other women in her country.
p165
aa(lp166
VWangari Maathai \u2014
p167
aV2004 Peace laureate.
p168
aVThey call her the "Tree Lady,"
p169
aVbut she's more than the Tree Lady.
p170
aVWorking for peace
p171
aVis very creative.
p172
aVIt's hard work every day.
p173
aVWhen she was planting those trees,
p174
aVI don't think most people understand
p175
aVthat, at the same time,
p176
aVshe was using the action
p177
aVof getting people together to plant those trees
p178
aVto talk about how to overcome
p179
aVthe authoritarian government in her country.
p180
aVPeople could not gather
p181
aVwithout getting busted and taken to jail.
p182
aVBut if they were together planting trees for the environment,
p183
aVit was okay \u2014
p184
aVcreativity.
p185
aVBut it's not just iconic women
p186
aVlike Shirin,
p187
aVlike Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai \u2014
p188
aVit is other women in the world
p189
aVwho are also struggling together
p190
aVto change this world.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe Women's League of Burma,
p193
aV11 individual organizations of Burmese women
p194
aVcame together because there's strength in numbers.
p195
aVWorking together is what changes our world.
p196
aVThe Million Signatures Campaign
p197
aVof women inside Burma
p198
aVworking together to change human rights,
p199
aVto bring democracy to that country.
p200
aVWhen one is arrested and taken to prison,
p201
aVanother one comes out and joins the movement,
p202
aVrecognizing that if they work together,
p203
aVthey will ultimately bring change
p204
aVin their own country.
p205
aa(lp206
VMairead McGuire in the middle,
p207
aVBetty Williams on the right-hand side \u2014
p208
aVbringing peace to Northern Ireland.
p209
aVI'll tell you the quick story.
p210
aVAn IRA driver was shot,
p211
aVand his car plowed into people
p212
aVon the side of the street.
p213
aVThere was a mother and three children.
p214
aVThe children were killed on the spot.
p215
aVIt was Mairead's sister.
p216
aVInstead of giving in
p217
aVto grief, depression, defeat
p218
aVin the face of that violence,
p219
aVMairead hooked up with Betty \u2014
p220
aVa staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic \u2014
p221
aVand they took to the streets
p222
aVto say, "No more violence."
p223
aVAnd they were able to get
p224
aVtens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men,
p225
aVin the streets to bring about change.
p226
aVAnd they have been
p227
aVpart of what brought peace to Northern Ireland,
p228
aVand they're still working on it,
p229
aVbecause there's still a lot more to do.
p230
aa(lp231
VThis is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.
p232
aVShe also received the Peace Prize.
p233
aVShe is now running for president.
p234
aVShe is educating the indigenous people of her country
p235
aVabout what it means to be a democracy,
p236
aVabout how you bring democracy to the country,
p237
aVabout educating, about how to vote \u2014
p238
aVbut that democracy is not just about voting;
p239
aVit's about being an active citizen.
p240
aa(lp241
VThat's what I got stuck doing \u2014
p242
aVthe landmine campaign.
p243
aVOne of the things that made this campaign work
p244
aVis because we grew from two NGOs
p245
aVto thousands
p246
aVin 90 countries around the world,
p247
aVworking together in common cause to ban landmines.
p248
aVSome of the people who worked in our campaign
p249
aVcould only work maybe an hour a month.
p250
aVThey could maybe volunteer that much.
p251
aVThere were others, like myself,
p252
aVwho were full-time.
p253
aVBut it was the actions, together, of all of us
p254
aVthat brought about that change.
p255
aa(lp256
VIn my view, what we need today
p257
aVis people getting up
p258
aVand taking action
p259
aVto reclaim the meaning of peace.
p260
aVIt's not a dirty word.
p261
aVIt's hard work every single day.
p262
aVAnd if each of us
p263
aVwho cares about the different things we care about
p264
aVgot up off our butts
p265
aVand volunteered
p266
aVas much time as we could,
p267
aVwe would change this world,
p268
aVwe would save this world.
p269
aVAnd we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.
p270
aa(lp271
VThank you.

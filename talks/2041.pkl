VOn March 10, 2011,
p5
aVI was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab
p6
aVmeeting with faculty, students and staff,
p7
aVand we were trying to figure out whether
p8
aVI should be the next director.
p9
aa(lp10
VThat night, at midnight,
p11
aVa magnitude 9 earthquake
p12
aVhit off of the Pacific coast of Japan.
p13
aVMy wife and family were in Japan,
p14
aVand as the news started to come in,
p15
aVI was panicking.
p16
aVI was looking at the news streams
p17
aVand listening to the press conferences
p18
aVof the government officials
p19
aVand the Tokyo Power Company,
p20
aVand hearing about this explosion
p21
aVat the nuclear reactors
p22
aVand this cloud of fallout
p23
aVthat was headed towards our house
p24
aVwhich was only about 200 kilometers away.
p25
aVAnd the people on TV weren't telling us
p26
aVanything that we wanted to hear.
p27
aVI wanted to know what was going on with the reactor,
p28
aVwhat was going on with the radiation,
p29
aVwhether my family was in danger.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo I did what instinctively felt like the right thing,
p32
aVwhich was to go onto the Internet
p33
aVand try to figure out
p34
aVif I could take matters into my own hands.
p35
aVOn the Net, I found there were a lot of other people
p36
aVlike me trying to figure out what was going on,
p37
aVand together we sort of loosely formed a group
p38
aVand we called it Safecast,
p39
aVand we decided we were going to try
p40
aVto measure the radiation
p41
aVand get the data out to everybody else,
p42
aVbecause it was clear that the government
p43
aVwasn't going to be doing this for us.
p44
aa(lp45
VThree years later,
p46
aVwe have 16 million data points,
p47
aVwe have designed our own Geiger counters
p48
aVthat you can download the designs
p49
aVand plug it into the network.
p50
aVWe have an app that shows you
p51
aVmost of the radiation in Japan and other parts of the world.
p52
aVWe are arguably one of the most successful
p53
aVcitizen science projects in the world,
p54
aVand we have created
p55
aVthe largest open dataset of radiation measurements.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd the interesting thing here
p58
aVis how did \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 Thank you.
p59
aVHow did a bunch of amateurs
p60
aVwho really didn't know what we were doing
p61
aVsomehow come together
p62
aVand do what NGOs and the government
p63
aVwere completely incapable of doing?
p64
aVAnd I would suggest that this has something to do
p65
aVwith the Internet. It's not a fluke.
p66
aVIt wasn't luck, and it wasn't because it was us.
p67
aVIt helped that it was an event
p68
aVthat pulled everybody together,
p69
aVbut it was a new way of doing things
p70
aVthat was enabled by the Internet
p71
aVand a lot of the other things that were going on,
p72
aVand I want to talk a little bit about
p73
aVwhat those new principles are.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo remember before the Internet? (Laughter)
p76
aVI call this B.I. Okay?
p77
aVSo, in B.I., life was simple.
p78
aVThings were Euclidian, Newtonian,
p79
aVsomewhat predictable.
p80
aVPeople actually tried to predict the future,
p81
aVeven the economists.
p82
aVAnd then the Internet happened,
p83
aVand the world became extremely complex,
p84
aVextremely low-cost, extremely fast,
p85
aVand those Newtonian laws
p86
aVthat we so dearly cherished
p87
aVturned out to be just local ordinances,
p88
aVand what we found was that in this
p89
aVcompletely unpredictable world
p90
aVthat most of the people who were surviving
p91
aVwere working with sort of a different set of principles,
p92
aVand I want to talk a little bit about that.
p93
aa(lp94
VBefore the Internet, if you remember,
p95
aVwhen we tried to create services,
p96
aVwhat you would do is you'd create
p97
aVthe hardware layer and the network layer and the software
p98
aVand it would cost millions of dollars
p99
aVto do anything that was substantial.
p100
aVSo when it costs millions of dollars to do something substantial,
p101
aVwhat you would do is you'd get an MBA
p102
aVwho would write a plan
p103
aVand get the money
p104
aVfrom V.C.s or big companies,
p105
aVand then you'd hire the designers and the engineers,
p106
aVand they'd build the thing.
p107
aVThis is the Before Internet, B.I., innovation model.
p108
aVWhat happened after the Internet was
p109
aVthe cost of innovation went down so much
p110
aVbecause the cost of collaboration, the cost of distribution,
p111
aVthe cost of communication, and Moore's Law
p112
aVmade it so that the cost of trying a new thing
p113
aVbecame nearly zero,
p114
aVand so you would have Google, Facebook, Yahoo,
p115
aVstudents that didn't have permission \u2014
p116
aVpermissionless innovation \u2014
p117
aVdidn't have permission, didn't have PowerPoints,
p118
aVthey just built the thing,
p119
aVthen they raised the money,
p120
aVand then they sort of figured out a business plan
p121
aVand maybe later on they hired some MBAs.
p122
aVSo the Internet caused innovation,
p123
aVat least in software and services,
p124
aVto go from an MBA-driven innovation model
p125
aVto a designer-engineer-driven innovation model,
p126
aVand it pushed innovation to the edges,
p127
aVto the dorm rooms, to the startups,
p128
aVaway from the large institutions,
p129
aVthe stodgy old institutions that had the power
p130
aVand the money and the authority.
p131
aVAnd we all know this. We all know this happened on the Internet.
p132
aVIt turns out it's happening in other things, too.
p133
aVLet me give you some examples.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware.
p136
aVWe do all kinds of things.
p137
aVWe do biology, we do hardware,
p138
aVand Nicholas Negroponte famously said, "Demo or die,"
p139
aVas opposed to "Publish or perish,"
p140
aVwhich was the traditional academic way of thinking.
p141
aVAnd he often said, the demo only has to work once,
p142
aVbecause the primary mode of us impacting the world
p143
aVwas through large companies
p144
aVbeing inspired by us
p145
aVand creating products like the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms.
p146
aVBut today, with the ability
p147
aVto deploy things into the real world at such low cost,
p148
aVI'm changing the motto now,
p149
aVand this is the official public statement.
p150
aVI'm officially saying, "Deploy or die."
p151
aVYou have to get the stuff into the real world
p152
aVfor it to really count,
p153
aVand sometimes it will be large companies,
p154
aVand Nicholas can talk about satellites.
p155
aV(Applause)
p156
aVThank you.
p157
aVBut we should be getting out there ourselves
p158
aVand not depending on large institutions to do it for us.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo last year, we sent a bunch of students to Shenzhen,
p161
aVand they sat on the factory floors
p162
aVwith the innovators in Shenzhen, and it was amazing.
p163
aVWhat was happening there
p164
aVwas you would have these manufacturing devices,
p165
aVand they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints.
p166
aVThey were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment
p167
aVand innovating right on the manufacturing equipment.
p168
aVThe factory was in the designer,
p169
aVand the designer was literally in the factory.
p170
aVAnd so what you would do is,
p171
aVyou'd go down to the stalls
p172
aVand you would see these cell phones.
p173
aVSo instead of starting little websites
p174
aVlike the kids in Palo Alto do,
p175
aVthe kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones.
p176
aVThey make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto
p177
aVmake websites,
p178
aVand so there's a rainforest
p179
aVof innovation going on in the cell phone.
p180
aVWhat they do is, they make a cell phone,
p181
aVgo down to the stall, they sell some,
p182
aVthey look at the other kids' stuff, go up,
p183
aVmake a couple thousand more, go down.
p184
aVDoesn't this sound like a software thing?
p185
aVIt sounds like agile software development,
p186
aVA/B testing and iteration,
p187
aVand what we thought you could only do with software
p188
aVkids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware.
p189
aVMy next fellow, I hope, is going to be
p190
aVone of these innovators from Shenzhen.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd so what you see is
p193
aVthat is pushing innovation to the edges.
p194
aVWe talk about 3D printers and stuff like that,
p195
aVand that's great, but this is Limor.
p196
aVShe is one of our favorite graduates,
p197
aVand she is standing in front of a Samsung
p198
aVTechwin Pick and Place Machine.
p199
aVThis thing can put 23,000 components per hour
p200
aVonto an electronics board.
p201
aVThis is a factory in a box.
p202
aVSo what used to take a factory full of workers
p203
aVworking by hand
p204
aVin this little box in New York,
p205
aVshe's able to have effectively \u2014
p206
aVShe doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen
p207
aVto do this manufacturing.
p208
aVShe can buy this box and she can manufacture it.
p209
aVSo manufacturing, the cost of innovation,
p210
aVthe cost of prototyping, distribution, manufacturing, hardware,
p211
aVis getting so low
p212
aVthat innovation is being pushed to the edges
p213
aVand students and startups are being able to build it.
p214
aVThis is a recent thing, but this will happen
p215
aVand this will change
p216
aVjust like it did with software.
p217
aa(lp218
VSorona is a DuPont process
p219
aVthat uses a genetically engineered microbe
p220
aVto turn corn sugar into polyester.
p221
aVIt's 30 percent more efficient than the fossil fuel method,
p222
aVand it's much better for the environment.
p223
aVGenetic engineering and bioengineering
p224
aVare creating a whole bunch
p225
aVof great new opportunities
p226
aVfor chemistry, for computation, for memory.
p227
aVWe will probably be doing a lot, obviously doing health things,
p228
aVbut we will probably be growing chairs
p229
aVand buildings soon.
p230
aVThe problem is, Sorona costs about 400 million dollars
p231
aVand took seven years to build.
p232
aVIt kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days.
p233
aVThe thing is, the cost of innovation
p234
aVin bioengineering is also going down.
p235
aVThis is desktop gene sequencer.
p236
aVIt used to cost millions and millions of dollars to sequence genes.
p237
aVNow you can do it on a desktop like this,
p238
aVand kids can do this in dorm rooms.
p239
aVThis is Gen9 gene assembler,
p240
aVand so right now when you try to print a gene,
p241
aVwhat you do is somebody in a factory
p242
aVwith pipettes puts the thing together by hand,
p243
aVyou have one error per 100 base pairs,
p244
aVand it takes a long time and costs a lot of money.
p245
aVThis new device
p246
aVassembles genes on a chip,
p247
aVand instead of one error per 100 base pairs,
p248
aVit's one error per 10,000 base pairs.
p249
aVIn this lab, we will have the world's capacity
p250
aVof gene printing within a year,
p251
aV200 million base pairs a year.
p252
aVThis is kind of like when we went
p253
aVfrom transistor radios wrapped by hand
p254
aVto the Pentium.
p255
aVThis is going to become the Pentium of bioengineering,
p256
aVpushing bioengineering into the hands
p257
aVof dorm rooms and startup companies.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo it's happening in software and in hardware
p260
aVand bioengineering,
p261
aVand so this is a fundamental new way of thinking about innovation.
p262
aVIt's a bottom-up innovation, it's democratic,
p263
aVit's chaotic, it's hard to control.
p264
aVIt's not bad, but it's very different,
p265
aVand I think that the traditional rules that we have
p266
aVfor institutions don't work anymore,
p267
aVand most of us here
p268
aVoperate with a different set of principles.
p269
aVOne of my favorite principles is the power of pull,
p270
aVwhich is the idea of pulling resources
p271
aVfrom the network as you need them
p272
aVrather than stocking them in the center
p273
aVand controlling everything.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo in the case of the Safecast story,
p276
aVI didn't know anything when the earthquake happened,
p277
aVbut I was able to find Sean
p278
aVwho was the hackerspace community organizer,
p279
aVand Peter, the analog hardware hacker
p280
aVwho made our first Geiger counter,
p281
aVand Dan, who built the Three Mile Island
p282
aVmonitoring system after the Three Mile Island meltdown.
p283
aVAnd these people I wouldn't have been able to find
p284
aVbeforehand and probably were better
p285
aVthat I found them just in time from the network.
p286
aa(lp287
VI'm a three-time college dropout,
p288
aVso learning over education
p289
aVis very near and dear to my heart,
p290
aVbut to me, education is what people do to you
p291
aVand learning is what you do to yourself.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Applause)
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd it feels like, and I'm biased,
p296
aVit feels like they're trying to make you memorize
p297
aVthe whole encyclopedia before they let you go out and play,
p298
aVand to me, I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone,
p299
aVand it feels like they assume
p300
aVyou're going to be on top of some mountain
p301
aVall by yourself with a number 2 pencil
p302
aVtrying to figure out what to do
p303
aVwhen in fact you're always going to be connected,
p304
aVyou're always going to have friends,
p305
aVand you can pull Wikipedia up whenever you need it,
p306
aVand what you need to learn is how to learn.
p307
aVIn the case of Safecast, a bunch of amateurs
p308
aVwhen we started three years ago,
p309
aVI would argue that we probably as a group
p310
aVknow more than any other organization
p311
aVabout how to collect data and publish data
p312
aVand do citizen science.
p313
aa(lp314
VCompass over maps.
p315
aVSo this one, the idea is that the cost of writing a plan
p316
aVor mapping something is getting so expensive
p317
aVand it's not very accurate or useful.
p318
aVSo in the Safecast story, we knew we needed to collect data,
p319
aVwe knew we wanted to publish the data,
p320
aVand instead of trying to come up with the exact plan,
p321
aVwe first said, oh, let's get Geiger counters.
p322
aVOh, they've run out.
p323
aVLet's build them. There aren't enough sensors.
p324
aVOkay, then we can make a mobile Geiger counter.
p325
aVWe can drive around. We can get volunteers.
p326
aVWe don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it.
p327
aVWe could not have planned this whole thing,
p328
aVbut by having a very strong compass,
p329
aVwe eventually got to where we were going,
p330
aVand to me it's very similar to agile software development,
p331
aVbut this idea of compasses is very important.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo I think the good news is
p334
aVthat even though the world is extremely complex,
p335
aVwhat you need to do is very simple.
p336
aVI think it's about stopping this notion
p337
aVthat you need to plan everything,
p338
aVyou need to stock everything,
p339
aVand you need to be so prepared,
p340
aVand focus on being connected,
p341
aValways learning,
p342
aVfully aware,
p343
aVand super present.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo I don't like the word "futurist."
p346
aVI think we should be now-ists,
p347
aVlike we are right now.
p348
aa(lp349
VThank you.

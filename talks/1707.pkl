VThis is me building a prototype
p5
aVfor six hours straight.
p6
aVThis is slave labor to my own project.
p7
aVThis is what the DIY and maker movements really look like.
p8
aVAnd this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world
p9
aVwith brute-force assembly techniques.
p10
aVAnd this is exactly why I started studying
p11
aVhow to program physical materials to build themselves.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut there is another world.
p14
aVToday at the micro- and nanoscales,
p15
aVthere's an unprecedented revolution happening.
p16
aVAnd this is the ability to program physical and biological materials
p17
aVto change shape, change properties
p18
aVand even compute outside of silicon-based matter.
p19
aVThere's even a software called cadnano
p20
aVthat allows us to design three-dimensional shapes
p21
aVlike nano robots or drug delivery systems
p22
aVand use DNA to self-assemble those functional structures.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut if we look at the human scale,
p25
aVthere's massive problems that aren't being addressed
p26
aVby those nanoscale technologies.
p27
aVIf we look at construction and manufacturing,
p28
aVthere's major inefficiencies, energy consumption
p29
aVand excessive labor techniques.
p30
aVIn infrastructure, let's just take one example.
p31
aVTake piping.
p32
aVIn water pipes, we have fixed-capacity water pipes
p33
aVthat have fixed flow rates, except for expensive pumps and valves.
p34
aVWe bury them in the ground.
p35
aVIf anything changes \u2014 if the environment changes,
p36
aVthe ground moves, or demand changes \u2014
p37
aVwe have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds,
p40
aVthat we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials
p41
aVand the built environment.
p42
aVAnd I don't mean automated machines.
p43
aVI don't just mean smart machines that replace humans.
p44
aVBut I mean programmable materials that build themselves.
p45
aVAnd that's called self-assembly,
p46
aVwhich is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure
p47
aVthrough only local interaction.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale?
p50
aVWe need a few simple ingredients.
p51
aVThe first ingredient is materials and geometry,
p52
aVand that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source.
p53
aVAnd you can use passive energy \u2014
p54
aVso heat, shaking, pneumatics, gravity, magnetics.
p55
aVAnd then you need smartly designed interactions.
p56
aVAnd those interactions allow for error correction,
p57
aVand they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built,
p60
aVfrom one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional
p61
aVand even four-dimensional systems.
p62
aVSo in one-dimensional systems \u2014
p63
aVthis is a project called the self-folding proteins.
p64
aVAnd the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein \u2014
p65
aVin this case it's the crambin protein \u2014
p66
aVyou take the backbone \u2014 so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions \u2014
p67
aVand you break that down into a series of components.
p68
aVAnd then we embed elastic.
p69
aVAnd when I throw this up into the air and catch it,
p70
aVit has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.
p71
aVAnd this gives us a tangible model
p72
aVof the three-dimensional protein and how it folds
p73
aVand all of the intricacies of the geometry.
p74
aVSo we can study this as a physical, intuitive model.
p75
aVAnd we're also translating that into two-dimensional systems \u2014
p76
aVso flat sheets that can self-fold into three-dimensional structures.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn three dimensions, we did a project last year at TEDGlobal
p79
aVwith Autodesk and Arthur Olson
p80
aVwhere we looked at autonomous parts \u2014
p81
aVso individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own.
p82
aVAnd we built 500 of these glass beakers.
p83
aVThey had different molecular structures inside
p84
aVand different colors that could be mixed and matched.
p85
aVAnd we gave them away to all the TEDsters.
p86
aVAnd so these became intuitive models
p87
aVto understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale.
p88
aVThis is the polio virus.
p89
aVYou shake it hard and it breaks apart.
p90
aVAnd then you shake it randomly
p91
aVand it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own.
p92
aVAnd this is demonstrating that through random energy,
p93
aVwe can build non-random shapes.
p94
aa(lp95
VWe even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale.
p96
aVLast year at TED Long Beach,
p97
aVwe built an installation that builds installations.
p98
aVThe idea was, could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects?
p99
aVSo we built a large rotating chamber,
p100
aVand people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower,
p101
aVadding energy to the system
p102
aVand getting an intuitive understanding of how self-assembly works
p103
aVand how we could use this
p104
aVas a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo remember, I said 4D.
p107
aVSo today for the first time, we're unveiling a new project,
p108
aVwhich is a collaboration with Stratasys,
p109
aVand it's called 4D printing.
p110
aVThe idea behind 4D printing
p111
aVis that you take multi-material 3D printing \u2014
p112
aVso you can deposit multiple materials \u2014
p113
aVand you add a new capability,
p114
aVwhich is transformation,
p115
aVthat right off the bed,
p116
aVthe parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own.
p117
aVAnd this is like robotics without wires or motors.
p118
aVSo you completely print this part,
p119
aVand it can transform into something else.
p120
aa(lp121
VWe also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg.
p122
aVAnd this allows us to simulate this self-assembly behavior
p123
aVand try to optimize which parts are folding when.
p124
aVBut most importantly, we can use this same software
p125
aVfor the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems
p126
aVand human scale self-assembly systems.
p127
aVThese are parts being printed with multi-material properties.
p128
aVHere's the first demonstration.
p129
aVA single strand dipped in water
p130
aVthat completely self-folds on its own
p131
aVinto the letters M I T.
p132
aVI'm biased.
p133
aVThis is another part, single strand, dipped in a bigger tank
p134
aVthat self-folds into a cube, a three-dimensional structure, on its own.
p135
aVSo no human interaction.
p136
aVAnd we think this is the first time
p137
aVthat a program and transformation
p138
aVhas been embedded directly into the materials themselves.
p139
aVAnd it also might just be the manufacturing technique
p140
aVthat allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo I know you're probably thinking,
p143
aVokay, that's cool, but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment?
p144
aVSo I've started a lab at MIT,
p145
aVand it's called the Self-Assembly Lab.
p146
aVAnd we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials
p147
aVfor the built environment.
p148
aVAnd we think there's a few key sectors
p149
aVthat have fairly near-term applications.
p150
aVOne of those is in extreme environments.
p151
aVThese are scenarios where it's difficult to build,
p152
aVour current construction techniques don't work,
p153
aVit's too large, it's too dangerous, it's expensive, too many parts.
p154
aVAnd space is a great example of that.
p155
aVWe're trying to design new scenarios for space
p156
aVthat have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures
p157
aVthat can go from highly functional systems from one to another.
p158
aa(lp159
VLet's go back to infrastructure.
p160
aVIn infrastructure, we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec.
p161
aVAnd we're developing a new paradigm for piping.
p162
aVImagine if water pipes could expand or contract
p163
aVto change capacity or change flow rate,
p164
aVor maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves.
p165
aVSo this isn't expensive pumps or valves.
p166
aVThis is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo I want to remind you today
p169
aVof the harsh realities of assembly in our world.
p170
aVThese are complex things built with complex parts
p171
aVthat come together in complex ways.
p172
aVSo I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from
p173
aVto join us in reinventing and reimagining the world,
p174
aVhow things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale,
p175
aVso that we can go from a world like this
p176
aVto a world that's more like this.
p177
aa(lp178
VThank you.

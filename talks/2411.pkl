VI have a question.
p5
aVCan a computer write poetry?
p6
aVThis is a provocative question.
p7
aVYou think about it for a minute,
p8
aVand you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like:
p9
aVWhat is a computer?
p10
aVWhat is poetry?
p11
aVWhat is creativity?
p12
aVBut these are questions
p13
aVthat people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer,
p14
aVnot in a single TED Talk.
p15
aVSo we're going to have to try a different approach.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo up here, we have two poems.
p18
aVOne of them is written by a human,
p19
aVand the other one's written by a computer.
p20
aVI'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which.
p21
aVHave a go:
p22
aa(lp23
VPoem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, / My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.
p24
aVAm I not / A fly like thee? / Or art not thou / A man like me?
p25
aa(lp26
VPoem 2: We can feel / Activist through your life's / morning /
p27
aVPauses to see, pope I hate the / Non all the night to start a / great otherwise (...)
p28
aa(lp29
VAlright, time's up.
p30
aVHands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human.
p31
aVOK, most of you.
p32
aVHands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human.
p33
aVVery brave of you,
p34
aVbecause the first one was written by the human poet William Blake.
p35
aVThe second one was written by an algorithm
p36
aVthat took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day
p37
aVand then regenerated it algorithmically,
p38
aVaccording to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on.
p39
aVSo let's try another test.
p40
aVAgain, you haven't got ages to read this,
p41
aVso just trust your gut.
p42
aa(lp43
VPoem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks. It is interesting / and fascinating
p44
aVthat a bird will fly and not / roar or bark. Enthralling stories about animals
p45
aVare in my dreams and I will sing them all if I / am not exhausted or weary.
p46
aa(lp47
VPoem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas! / You are really beautiful!
p48
aVPearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! All / the stuff they've always talked about (...)
p49
aa(lp50
VAlright, time's up.
p51
aVSo if you think the first poem was written by a human,
p52
aVput your hand up.
p53
aVOK.
p54
aVAnd if you think the second poem was written by a human,
p55
aVput your hand up.
p56
aVWe have, more or less, a 50/50 split here.
p57
aVIt was much harder.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe answer is,
p60
aVthe first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter,
p61
aVthat was created back in the 1970s,
p62
aVand the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara,
p63
aVwho happens to be one of my favorite human poets.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VSo what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry.
p68
aVThe Turing test was first proposed by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950,
p69
aVin order to answer the question,
p70
aVcan computers think?
p71
aVAlan Turing believed that if a computer was able
p72
aVto have a to have a text-based conversation with a human,
p73
aVwith such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell
p74
aVwhether they are talking to a computer or a human,
p75
aVthen the computer can be said to have intelligence.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I,
p78
aVwe created a Turing test for poetry online.
p79
aVIt's called bot or not,
p80
aVand you can go and play it for yourselves.
p81
aVBut basically, it's the game we just played.
p82
aVYou're presented with a poem,
p83
aVyou don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer
p84
aVand you have to guess.
p85
aVSo thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online,
p86
aVso we have results.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd what are the results?
p89
aVWell, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human
p90
aV30 percent of the time that it was a human,
p91
aVthen it passes the Turing test for intelligence.
p92
aVWe have poems on the bot or not database
p93
aVthat have fooled 65 percent of human readers into thinking
p94
aVit was written by a human.
p95
aVSo, I think we have an answer to our question.
p96
aVAccording to the logic of the Turing test,
p97
aVcan a computer write poetry?
p98
aVWell, yes, absolutely it can.
p99
aVBut if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable
p100
aVwith this answer, that's OK.
p101
aVIf you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it,
p102
aVthat's also OK because this isn't the end of the story.
p103
aa(lp104
VLet's play our third and final test.
p105
aVAgain, you're going to have to read
p106
aVand tell me which you think is human.
p107
aa(lp108
VPoem 1: Red flags the reason for pretty flags. / And ribbons.
p109
aVRibbons of flags / And wearing material / Reasons for wearing material. (...)
p110
aa(lp111
VPoem 2: A wounded deer leaps highest, / I've heard the daffodil
p112
aVI've heard the flag to-day / I've heard the hunter tell; /
p113
aV'Tis but the ecstasy of death, / And then the brake is almost done (...)
p114
aa(lp115
VOK, time is up.
p116
aVSo hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human.
p117
aVHands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human.
p118
aVWhoa, that's a lot more people.
p119
aVSo you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1
p120
aVwas written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein.
p121
aVAnd Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP.
p122
aVNow before we go on, let me describe very quickly and simply,
p123
aVhow RKCP works.
p124
aVSo RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil,
p125
aVwho's a director of engineering at Google
p126
aVand a firm believer in artificial intelligence.
p127
aVSo, you give RKCP a source text,
p128
aVit analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language,
p129
aVand then it regenerates language
p130
aVthat emulates that first text.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo in the poem we just saw before,
p133
aVPoem 2, the one that you all thought was human,
p134
aVit was fed a bunch of poems
p135
aVby a poet called Emily Dickinson
p136
aVit looked at the way she used language,
p137
aVlearned the model,
p138
aVand then it regenerated a model according to that same structure.
p139
aVBut the important thing to know about RKCP
p140
aVis that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using.
p141
aVThe language is just raw material,
p142
aVit could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish,
p143
aVit could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day.
p144
aVIt's just raw material.
p145
aVAnd nevertheless, it's able to create a poem
p146
aVthat seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem,
p147
aVand Gertrude Stein is a human.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo what we've done here is, more or less, a reverse Turing test.
p150
aVSo Gertrude Stein, who's a human, is able to write a poem
p151
aVthat fools a majority of human judges into thinking
p152
aVthat it was written by a computer.
p153
aVTherefore, according to the logic of the reverse Turing test,
p154
aVGertrude Stein is a computer.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VFeeling confused?
p159
aVI think that's fair enough.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo far we've had humans that write like humans,
p162
aVwe have computers that write like computers,
p163
aVwe have computers that write like humans,
p164
aVbut we also have, perhaps most confusingly,
p165
aVhumans that write like computers.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo what do we take from all of this?
p168
aVDo we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human
p169
aVthan Gertrude Stein?
p170
aVOr that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake?
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VThese are questions I've been asking myself
p175
aVfor around two years now,
p176
aVand I don't have any answers.
p177
aVBut what I do have are a bunch of insights
p178
aVabout our relationship with technology.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo my first insight is that, for some reason,
p181
aVwe associate poetry with being human.
p182
aVSo that when we ask, "Can a computer write poetry?"
p183
aVwe're also asking,
p184
aV"What does it mean to be human
p185
aVand how do we put boundaries around this category?
p186
aVHow do we say who or what can be part of this category?"
p187
aVThis is an essentially philosophical question, I believe,
p188
aVand it can't be answered with a yes or no test,
p189
aVlike the Turing test.
p190
aVI also believe that Alan Turing understood this,
p191
aVand that when he devised his test back in 1950,
p192
aVhe was doing it as a philosophical provocation.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo my second insight is that, when we take the Turing test for poetry,
p195
aVwe're not really testing the capacity of the computers
p196
aVbecause poetry-generating algorithms,
p197
aVthey're pretty simple and have existed, more or less, since the 1950s.
p198
aVWhat we are doing with the Turing test for poetry, rather,
p199
aVis collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness.
p200
aVSo, what I've figured out,
p201
aVwe've seen this when earlier today,
p202
aVwe say that William Blake is more of a human
p203
aVthan Gertrude Stein.
p204
aVOf course, this doesn't mean that William Blake
p205
aVwas actually more human
p206
aVor that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer.
p207
aVIt simply means that the category of the human is unstable.
p208
aVThis has led me to understand
p209
aVthat the human is not a cold, hard fact.
p210
aVRather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions
p211
aVand something that changes over time.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo my final insight is that the computer, more or less,
p214
aVworks like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human
p215
aVthat we show it.
p216
aVWe show it Emily Dickinson,
p217
aVit gives Emily Dickinson back to us.
p218
aVWe show it William Blake,
p219
aVthat's what it reflects back to us.
p220
aVWe show it Gertrude Stein,
p221
aVwhat we get back is Gertrude Stein.
p222
aVMore than any other bit of technology,
p223
aVthe computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing
p226
aVa lot about artificial intelligence recently.
p227
aVAnd much of the conversation is,
p228
aVcan we build it?
p229
aVCan we build an intelligent computer?
p230
aVCan we build a creative computer?
p231
aVWhat we seem to be asking over and over
p232
aVis can we build a human-like computer?
p233
aa(lp234
VBut what we've seen just now
p235
aVis that the human is not a scientific fact,
p236
aVthat it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea
p237
aVand one that changes over time.
p238
aVSo that when we begin to grapple with the ideas
p239
aVof artificial intelligence in the future,
p240
aVwe shouldn't only be asking ourselves,
p241
aV"Can we build it?"
p242
aVBut we should also be asking ourselves,
p243
aV"What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us?"
p244
aVThis is an essentially philosophical idea,
p245
aVand it's one that can't be answered with software alone,
p246
aVbut I think requires a moment of species-wide, existential reflection.
p247
aa(lp248
VThank you.

V(Applause)

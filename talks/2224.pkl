V(Clicking)
p5
aVI was born with bilateral retinoblastoma,
p6
aVretinal cancer.
p7
aVMy right eye was removed
p8
aVat seven months of age.
p9
aVI was 13 months when they removed my left eye.
p10
aVThe first thing I did upon awakening from that last surgery
p11
aVwas to climb out of my crib
p12
aVand begin wandering around the intensive care nursery,
p13
aVprobably looking for the one who did this to me.
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVEvidently, wandering around the nursery
p16
aVwas not a problem for me without eyes.
p17
aVThe problem was getting caught.
p18
aa(lp19
VIt's impressions about blindness
p20
aVthat are far more threatening
p21
aVto blind people than the blindness itself.
p22
aVThink for a moment about your own impressions of blindness.
p23
aVThink about your reactions when I first came onto the stage,
p24
aVor the prospect of your own blindness,
p25
aVor a loved one going blind.
p26
aVThe terror is incomprehensible to most of us,
p27
aVbecause blindness
p28
aVis thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness,
p29
aVhapless exposure to the ravages of the dark unknown.
p30
aVHow poetic.
p31
aa(lp32
VFortunately for me, my parents were not poetic.
p33
aVThey were pragmatic.
p34
aVThey understood that ignorance and fear were but matters of the mind,
p35
aVand the mind is adaptable.
p36
aVThey believed that I should grow up
p37
aVto enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities as everyone else.
p38
aVIn their own words, I would move out \u2014
p39
aVwhich I did when I was 18 \u2014
p40
aVI will pay taxes \u2014
p41
aVthanks \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p42
aVand they knew the difference between love and fear.
p43
aVFear immobilizes us in the face of challenge.
p44
aVThey knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge.
p45
aVI was not raised with fear.
p46
aVThey put my freedom first before all else,
p47
aVbecause that is what love does.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, moving forward, how do I manage today?
p50
aVThe world is a much larger nursery.
p51
aVFortunately, I have my trusty long cane,
p52
aVlonger than the canes used by most blind people.
p53
aVI call it my freedom staff.
p54
aVIt will keep me, for example,
p55
aVfrom making an undignified  departure from the stage. (Laughter)
p56
aVI do see that cliff edge.
p57
aVThey warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap
p58
aVhas occurred to speakers up here on the stage.
p59
aVI don't care to set a new precedent.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut beyond that,
p62
aVmany of you may have heard me clicking as I came onto the stage \u2014
p63
aV(Clicking) \u2014
p64
aVwith my tongue.
p65
aVThose are flashes of sound
p66
aVthat go out and reflect from surfaces all around me,
p67
aVjust like a bat's sonar,
p68
aVand return to me with patterns,  with pieces of information,
p69
aVmuch as light does for you.
p70
aVAnd my brain, thanks to my parents,
p71
aVhas been activated to form images in my visual cortex,
p72
aVwhich we now call the imaging system,
p73
aVfrom those patterns of information, much as your brain does.
p74
aVI call this process flash sonar.
p75
aVIt is how I have learned to see through my blindness,
p76
aVto navigate my journey
p77
aVthrough the dark unknowns of my own challenges,
p78
aVwhich has earned me the moniker
p79
aV"the remarkable Batman."
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, Batman I will accept.
p82
aVBats are cool. Batman is cool.
p83
aVBut I was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable.
p84
aVI have always regarded myself much like anyone else
p85
aVwho navigates the dark unknowns of their own challenges.
p86
aVIs that so remarkable?
p87
aVI do not use my eyes, I use my brain.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, someone, somewhere,
p90
aVmust think that's remarkable, or I wouldn't be up here,
p91
aVbut let's consider this for a moment.
p92
aVEveryone out there
p93
aVwho faces or who has ever faced a challenge,
p94
aVraise your hands.
p95
aVWhoosh. Okay.
p96
aVLots of hands going up, a moment, let me do a head count.
p97
aV(Clicking)
p98
aVThis will take a while. (Clicking) (Laughter)
p99
aVOkay, lots of hands in the air.
p100
aVKeep them up. I have an idea.
p101
aVThose of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges,
p102
aVput your hands down.
p103
aVOkay, anyone with your hands still up
p104
aVhas challenges of your own. (Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VSo we all face challenges,
p107
aVand we all face the dark unknown,
p108
aVwhich is endemic to most challenges, which is what most of us fear, okay?
p109
aVBut we all have brains
p110
aVthat allow us, that activate to allow us
p111
aVto navigate the journey through these challenges. Okay?
p112
aa(lp113
VCase in point: I came up here
p114
aVand \u2014 (Clicking) \u2014 they wouldn't tell me
p115
aVwhere the lectern was.
p116
aVSo you can't trust those TED folks.
p117
aV"Find it yourself," they said.
p118
aVSo \u2014 (Laughter)
p119
aVAnd the feedback for the P.A. system is no help at all.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo now I present to you a challenge.
p122
aVSo if you'd all close your eyes for just a moment, okay?
p123
aVAnd you're going to learn a bit of flash sonar.
p124
aVI'm going to make a sound.
p125
aVI'm going to hold this panel in front  of me, but I'm not going to move it.
p126
aVJust listen to the sound for a moment.
p127
aVShhhhhhhhhh.
p128
aVOkay, nothing very interesting.
p129
aVNow, listen to what happens to that same exact sound
p130
aVwhen I move the panel.
p131
aVShhhhhhhhhhh.  (Pitch getting higher and lower)
p132
aVYou do not know the power of the dark side.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVI couldn't resist.
p135
aa(lp136
VOkay, now keep your eyes closed
p137
aVbecause, did you hear the difference?
p138
aVOkay. Now, let's be sure.
p139
aVFor your challenge,
p140
aVyou tell me, just say "now" when you hear the panel start to move.
p141
aVOkay? We'll relax into this.
p142
aa(lp143
VShhhhhhh.
p144
aa(lp145
VAudience: Now. Daniel Kish: Good. Excellent.
p146
aVOpen your eyes.
p147
aVAll right. So just a few centimeters,
p148
aVyou would notice the difference.
p149
aVYou've experienced sonar.
p150
aVYou'd all make great blind people. (Laughter)
p151
aVLet's have a look at what can happen
p152
aVwhen this activation process
p153
aVis given some time and attention.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Video) Juan Ruiz: It's like you guys can see with your eyes
p156
aVand we can see with our ears.
p157
aa(lp158
VBrian Bushway: It's not a matter of enjoying it more or less,
p159
aVit's about enjoying it differently.
p160
aa(lp161
VShawn Marsolais: It goes across. DK: Yeah.
p162
aa(lp163
VSM: And then it's gradually coming back down again.
p164
aa(lp165
VDK: Yes! SM: That's amazing.
p166
aVI can, like, see the car. Holy mother!
p167
aa(lp168
VJ. Louchart: I love being blind.
p169
aVIf I had the opportunity, honestly, I wouldn't go back to being sighted.
p170
aa(lp171
VJR: The bigger the goal, the more obstacles you'll face,
p172
aVand on the other side of that goal
p173
aVis victory.
p174
aV[In Italian]
p175
aV(Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VDK: Now, do these people look terrified?
p178
aVNot so much.
p179
aVWe have delivered activation training
p180
aVto tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds
p181
aVin nearly 40 countries.
p182
aVWhen blind people learn to see,
p183
aVsighted people seem inspired
p184
aVto want to learn to see their way better, more clearly, with less fear,
p185
aVbecause this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all
p186
aVto navigate any type of challenge, through any form of darkness,
p187
aVto discoveries unimagined
p188
aVwhen we are activated.
p189
aa(lp190
VI wish you all a most activating journey.
p191
aa(lp192
VThank you very much.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Applause)
p195
aa(lp196
VChris Anderson: Daniel, my friend.
p197
aVAs I know you can see, it's a spectacular standing ovation at TED.
p198
aVThank you for an extraordinary talk.
p199
aVJust one more question about your world, your inner world that you construct.
p200
aVWe think that we have things in our world that you as a blind person don't have,
p201
aVbut what's your world like?
p202
aVWhat do you have that we don't have?
p203
aa(lp204
VDK: Three hundred and sixty-degree view,
p205
aVso my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me.
p206
aVIt works around corners.
p207
aVIt works through surfaces.
p208
aVGenerally, it's kind of a fuzzy three-dimensional geometry.
p209
aVOne of my students, who has now become an instructor,
p210
aVwhen he lost his vision, after a few months
p211
aVhe was sitting in his three story house
p212
aVand he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house:
p213
aVconversations, people in the kitchen, people in the bathroom,
p214
aVseveral floors away, several walls away.
p215
aVHe said it was something like having x-ray vision.
p216
aa(lp217
VCA: What do you picture that you're in right now?
p218
aVHow do you picture this theater?
p219
aa(lp220
VDK: Lots of loudspeakers, quite frankly.
p221
aVIt's interesting.  When people make a sound,
p222
aVwhen they laugh, when they fidget, when they take a drink or blow their nose
p223
aVor whatever, I hear everything.
p224
aVI hear every little movement that every single person makes.
p225
aVNone of it really escapes my attention,
p226
aVand then, from a sonar perspective,
p227
aVthe size of the room, the curvature  of the audience around the stage,
p228
aVit's the height of the room.
p229
aVLike I say, it's all that kind  of three-dimensional surface geometry
p230
aVall around me.
p231
aa(lp232
VCA: Well, Daniel, you have done a spectacular job
p233
aVof helping us all see the world in a different way.
p234
aVThanks so much for that, truly. DK: Thank you.

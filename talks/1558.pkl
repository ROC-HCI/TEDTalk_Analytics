VSo when the White House was built
p5
aVin the early 19th century, it was an open house.
p6
aVNeighbors came and went. Under President Adams,
p7
aVa local dentist happened by.
p8
aVHe wanted to shake the President's hand.
p9
aVThe President dismissed the Secretary of State,
p10
aVwhom he was conferring with, and asked the dentist
p11
aVif he would remove a tooth.
p12
aVLater, in the 1850s, under President Pierce,
p13
aVhe was known to have remarked
p14
aV\u2014 probably the only thing he's known for \u2014
p15
aVwhen a neighbor passed by and said, "I'd love to see
p16
aVthe beautiful house," and Pierce said to him,
p17
aV"Why my dear sir, of course you may come in.
p18
aVThis isn't my house. It is the people's house."
p19
aa(lp20
VWell, when I got to the White House in the beginning
p21
aVof 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration,
p22
aVthe White House was anything but open.
p23
aVBomb blast curtains covered my windows.
p24
aVWe were running Windows 2000.
p25
aVSocial media were blocked at the firewall.
p26
aVWe didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen twitter accounts
p27
aVlike we have today.
p28
aVI came in to become the head of Open Government,
p29
aVto take the values and the practices of transparency,
p30
aVparticipation and collaboration, and instill them
p31
aVinto the way that we work, to open up government,
p32
aVto work with people.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow one of the things that we know
p35
aVis that companies are very good at getting people to work
p36
aVtogether in teams and in networks to make
p37
aVvery complex products, like cars and computers,
p38
aVand the more complex the products are a society creates,
p39
aVthe more successful the society is over time.
p40
aVCompanies make goods, but governments,
p41
aVthey make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer
p42
aVand educating our children and making roads,
p43
aVbut we don't have institutions that are particularly good
p44
aVat this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions
p45
aVthat are good at bringing our talents to bear,
p46
aVat working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo when we wanted to create our Open Government policy,
p49
aVwhat did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector
p50
aVemployees how we should open up government.
p51
aVTurns out that had never been done before.
p52
aVWe wanted to ask members of the public to help us
p53
aVcome up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting
p54
aVon a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case,
p55
aVbut in advance. There was no legal precedent,
p56
aVno cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this.
p57
aVIn fact, many people told us it was illegal.
p58
aa(lp59
VHere's the crux of the obstacle.
p60
aVGovernments exist to channel the flow of two things,
p61
aVreally, values and expertise to and from government
p62
aVand to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.
p63
aVBut the way that our institutions are designed,
p64
aVin our rather 18th-century, centralized model,
p65
aVis to channel the flow of values through voting,
p66
aVonce every four years, once every two years, at best,
p67
aVonce a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way, in this
p68
aVera of social media, for us to actually express our values.
p69
aVToday we have technology that lets us express ourselves
p70
aVa great deal, perhaps a little too much.
p71
aa(lp72
VThen in the 19th century, we layer on
p73
aVthe concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state
p74
aVto help us govern complex and large societies.
p75
aVBut we've centralized these bureaucracies.
p76
aVWe've entrenched them. And we know that
p77
aVthe smartest person always works for someone else.
p78
aVWe need to only look around this room to know that
p79
aVexpertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society,
p80
aVand not limited simply to our institutions.
p81
aa(lp82
VScientists have been studying in recent years
p83
aVthe phenomenon that they often describe as flow,
p84
aVthat the design of our systems, whether natural or social,
p85
aVchannel the flow of whatever runs through them.
p86
aVSo a river is designed to channel the flow of water,
p87
aVand the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels
p88
aVthe flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel
p89
aVthe flow of nutrients to the tree,
p90
aVsometimes even having to route around an obstacle,
p91
aVbut to get that nutrition flowing.
p92
aVThe same can be said for our social systems, for our
p93
aVsystems of government, where, at the very least,
p94
aVflow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding
p95
aVwhat the problem is, what's really broken,
p96
aVand the urgent need that we have, that we all feel today,
p97
aVto redesign the flow of our institutions.
p98
aa(lp99
VWe live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks,
p100
aVand we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions
p101
aVthat are actually quite recent.
p102
aVThink about it: What other business do you know,
p103
aVwhat other sector of the economy, and especially one
p104
aVas big as the public sector, that doesn't seek to reinvent
p105
aVits business model on a regular basis?
p106
aVSure, we invest plenty in innovation. We invest
p107
aVin broadband and science education and science grants,
p108
aVbut we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning
p109
aVthe institutions that we have.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, it's very easy to complain, of course, about
p112
aVpartisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy, and we love
p113
aVto complain about government. It's a perennial pastime,
p114
aVespecially around election time, but
p115
aVthe world is complex. We soon will have 10 billion people,
p116
aVmany of whom will lack basic resources.
p117
aVSo complain as we might, what actually can replace
p118
aVwhat we have today?
p119
aVWhat comes the day after the Arab Spring?
p120
aa(lp121
VWell, one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself
p122
aVto us is that of networks. Right? Networks
p123
aVlike Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean.
p124
aVYou've got 3,000 employees at Facebook
p125
aVgoverning 900 million inhabitants.
p126
aVWe might even call them citizens, because they've recently
p127
aVrisen up to fight against legislative incursion,
p128
aVand the citizens of these networks work together
p129
aVto serve each other in great ways.
p130
aVBut private communities, private, corporate,
p131
aVprivatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies.
p132
aVThey cannot replace government.
p133
aVFriending someone on Facebook is not complex enough
p134
aVto do the hard work of you and I collaborating
p135
aVwith each other and doing the hard work of governance.
p136
aVBut social media do teach us something.
p137
aVWhy is Twitter so successful? Because it opens up its platform.
p138
aVIt opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands
p139
aVof new applications to be built on top of it, so that we can
p140
aVread and process information in new and exciting ways.
p141
aVWe need to think about how to open up the API
p142
aVof government, and the way that we're going to do that,
p143
aVthe next great superpower is going to be the one
p144
aVwho can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution \u2014
p145
aVbecause we have to maintain those public values,
p146
aVwe have to coordinate the flow \u2014 but with the diversity
p147
aVand the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement
p148
aVof networks, all of us working together to build
p149
aVthese new innovations on top of our institutions,
p150
aVto engage in the practice of governance.
p151
aa(lp152
VWe have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here,
p153
aVin the 12th century, invented the jury.
p154
aVPowerful, practical, palpable model for handing power
p155
aVfrom government to citizens.
p156
aVToday we have the opportunity, and we have
p157
aVthe imperative, to create thousands of new ways
p158
aVof interconnecting between networks and institutions,
p159
aVthousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury,
p160
aVthe Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning
p161
aVto invent the models by which we can cocreate
p162
aVthe process of governance.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like
p165
aVyet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution
p166
aVemerging all around us \u2014 maybe not even evolution,
p167
aVI'd even start to call it a revolution \u2014 in the way that we govern.
p168
aVSome of it's very high-tech,
p169
aVand some of it is extremely low-tech,
p170
aVsuch as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan,
p171
aVIndia, where they take the spending data of the state
p172
aVand paint it on 100,000 village walls,
p173
aVand then invite the villagers to come and comment
p174
aVwho is on the government payroll, who's actually died,
p175
aVwhat are the bridges that have been built to nowhere,
p176
aVand to work together through civic engagement to save
p177
aVreal money and participate and have access to that budget.
p178
aa(lp179
VBut it's not just about policing government.
p180
aVIt's also about creating government.
p181
aVSpacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding,
p182
aVgetting you and me to raise the money to build
p183
aVthe goalposts and the park benches that will actually
p184
aVallow us to deliver better services in our communities.
p185
aVNo one is better at this activity of actually getting us
p186
aVto engage in delivering services,
p187
aVsometimes where none exist, than Ushahidi.
p188
aVCreated after the post-election riots in Kenya in 2008,
p189
aVthis crisis-mapping website and community is actually able
p190
aVto crowdsource and target the delivery of
p191
aVbetter rescue services to people trapped under the rubble,
p192
aVwhether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti,
p193
aVor more recently in Italy.
p194
aVAnd the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter
p195
aVis certifying them, not simply to supplement existing
p196
aVgovernment institutions, but in many cases, to replace them.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow what we're seeing lots of examples of, obviously,
p199
aVis the opening up of government data,
p200
aVnot enough examples of this yet, but we're starting
p201
aVto see this practice of people creating and generating
p202
aVinnovative applications on top of government data.
p203
aVThere's so many examples I could have picked, and I
p204
aVselected this one of Jon Bon Jovi. Some of you
p205
aVmay or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen
p206
aVin New Jersey, where he caters to and serves the homeless
p207
aVand particularly homeless veterans.
p208
aVIn February, he approached the White House, and said,
p209
aV"I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national
p210
aVapplications, apps, that will help not only the homeless
p211
aVbut those who deliver services [to] them to do so better."
p212
aVFebruary 2012 to June of 2012,
p213
aVthe finalists are announced in the competition.
p214
aVCan you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear,
p215
aVgetting anything done in a four-month period of time?
p216
aVYou can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time,
p217
aVlet alone generate real, palpable innovations
p218
aVthat improve people's lives.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd I want to be clear to mention that this open government
p221
aVrevolution is not about privatizing government,
p222
aVbecause in many cases what it can do when we have
p223
aVthe will to do so is to deliver more progressive
p224
aVand better policy than the regulations and the legislative
p225
aVand litigation-oriented strategies
p226
aVby which we make policy today.
p227
aVIn the State of Texas, they regulate 515 professions,
p228
aVfrom well-driller to florist.
p229
aVNow, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas,
p230
aVbut do not make a flower arrangement without a license,
p231
aVbecause that will land you in jail.
p232
aVSo what is Texas doing? They're asking you and me,
p233
aVusing online policy wikis, to help not simply get rid of
p234
aVburdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship,
p235
aVbut to replace those regulations with more innovative
p236
aValternatives, sometimes using transparency in the creation
p237
aVof new iPhone apps that will allows us
p238
aVboth to protect consumers and the public
p239
aVand to encourage economic development.
p240
aa(lp241
VThat is a nice sideline of open government.
p242
aVIt's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard
p243
aVto development. It's the economic benefits and the
p244
aVjob creation that's coming from this open innovation work.
p245
aVSberbank, the largest and oldest bank in Russia,
p246
aVlargely owned by the Russian government,
p247
aVhas started practicing crowdsourcing, engaging
p248
aVits employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations.
p249
aVLast year they saved a billion dollars, 30 billion rubles,
p250
aVfrom open innovation, and they're pushing radically
p251
aVthe extension of crowdsourcing, not only from banking,
p252
aVbut into the public sector.
p253
aVAnd we see lots of examples of these innovators using
p254
aVopen government data, not simply to make apps,
p255
aVbut then to make companies and to hire people
p256
aVto build them working with the government.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo a lot of these innovations are local.
p259
aVIn San Ramon, California, they published an iPhone app
p260
aVin which they allow you or me to say we are certified
p261
aVCPR-trained, and then when someone has a heart attack,
p262
aVa notification goes out so that you
p263
aVcan rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR.
p264
aVThe victim who receives bystander CPR
p265
aVis more than twice as likely to survive.
p266
aV"There is a hero in all of us," is their slogan.
p267
aa(lp268
VBut it's not limited to the local.
p269
aVBritish Columbia, Canada, is publishing a catalogue
p270
aVof all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage
p271
aVwith the state in the cocreation of governance.
p272
aa(lp273
VLet me be very clear,
p274
aVand perhaps controversial,
p275
aVthat open government is not
p276
aVabout transparent government.
p277
aVSimply throwing data over the transom doesn't change
p278
aVhow government works.
p279
aVIt doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data
p280
aVto change lives, to solve problems, and it doesn't change
p281
aVgovernment.
p282
aVWhat it does is it creates an adversarial relationship
p283
aVbetween civil society and government
p284
aVover the control and ownership of information.
p285
aVAnd transparency, by itself, is not reducing the flow
p286
aVof money into politics, and arguably,
p287
aVit's not even producing accountability as well as it might
p288
aVif we took the next step of combining participation and
p289
aVcollaboration with transparency to transform how we work.
p290
aa(lp291
VWe're going to see this evolution really in two phases,
p292
aVI think. The first phase of the open government revolution
p293
aVis delivering better information from the crowd
p294
aVinto the center.
p295
aVStarting in 2005, and this is how this open government
p296
aVwork in the U.S. really got started,
p297
aVI was teaching a patent law class to my students and
p298
aVexplaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy
p299
aVhas the power to make a decision
p300
aVabout which patent application becomes the next patent,
p301
aVand therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights
p302
aVover an entire field of inventive activity.
p303
aVWell, what did we do? We said, we can make a website,
p304
aVwe can make an expert network, a social network,
p305
aVthat would connect the network to the institution
p306
aVto allow scientists and technologists to get
p307
aVbetter information to the patent office
p308
aVto aid in making those decisions.
p309
aVWe piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan
p310
aVand Australia, and now I'm pleased to report
p311
aVthat the United States Patent Office will be rolling out
p312
aVuniversal, complete, and total openness,
p313
aVso that all patent applications will now be open
p314
aVfor citizen participation, beginning this year.
p315
aa(lp316
VThe second phase of this evolution \u2014 Yeah. (Applause)
p317
aVThey deserve a hand. (Applause)
p318
aa(lp319
VThe first phase is in getting better information in.
p320
aVThe second phase is in getting decision-making power out.
p321
aVParticipatory budgeting has long been practiced
p322
aVin Porto Alegre, Brazil.
p323
aVThey're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago.
p324
aVRussia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together,
p325
aVas is Lithuania. When we start to see
p326
aVpower over the core functions of government
p327
aV\u2014 spending, legislation, decision-making \u2014
p328
aVthen we're well on our way to an open government revolution.
p329
aa(lp330
VThere are many things that we can do to get us there.
p331
aVObviously opening up the data is one,
p332
aVbut the important thing is to create lots more \u2014
p333
aVcreate and curate \u2014 lots more participatory opportunities.
p334
aVHackathons and mashathons and working with data
p335
aVto build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage
p336
aVand participate, like the jury is,
p337
aVbut we're going to need lots more things like it.
p338
aVAnd that's why we need to start with our youngest people.
p339
aVWe've heard talk here at TED about people
p340
aVbiohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino,
p341
aVand Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting
p342
aVyoung people to build websites and make videos.
p343
aVWhen we start by teaching young people that we live,
p344
aVnot in a passive society, a read-only society,
p345
aVbut in a writable society, where we have the power
p346
aVto change our communities, to change our institutions,
p347
aVthat's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway
p348
aVtowards this open government innovation,
p349
aVtowards this open government movement,
p350
aVtowards this open government revolution.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo let me close by saying that I think the important thing
p353
aVfor us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.
p354
aVWe don't have words, really, to describe it yet.
p355
aVWords like equality and fairness and the traditional
p356
aVelections, democracy, these are not really great terms yet.
p357
aVThey're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough
p358
aVto get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity
p359
aVthat awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see
p360
aVthe kinds of innovations, the hopeful and exciting
p361
aVinnovations that we hear talked about here at TED,
p362
aVin clean energy, in clean education,
p363
aVin development, if we want to see those adopted
p364
aVand we want to see those scaled,
p365
aVwe want to see them become the governance of tomorrow,
p366
aVthen we must all participate,
p367
aVthen we must get involved.
p368
aVWe must open up our institutions, and like the leaf,
p369
aVwe must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic,
p370
aVthroughout our culture, to create open institutions
p371
aVto create a stronger democracy, a better tomorrow.
p372
aVThank you. (Applause)

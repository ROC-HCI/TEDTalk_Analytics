VI've always been interested in
p5
aVthe relationship of formal structures and human behavior.
p6
aVIf you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town, people will move there.
p7
aVWell, law is also a powerful driver
p8
aVof human behavior.
p9
aVAnd what I'd like to discuss today
p10
aVis the need to overhaul and simplify the law
p11
aVto release the energy and passion
p12
aVof Americans, so that we can begin
p13
aVto address the challenges of our society.
p14
aa(lp15
VYou might have noticed that law has grown
p16
aVprogressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two.
p17
aVIf you run a business, it's hard to do much of anything
p18
aVwithout calling your general counsel.
p19
aVIndeed, there is this phenomenon now
p20
aVwhere the general counsels are becoming the CEOs.
p21
aVIt's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.
p22
aVYou need a lawyer to run the company,
p23
aVbecause there's so much law.
p24
aVBut it's not just business that's affected by this,
p25
aVit's actually pressed down into the daily activities
p26
aVof ordinary people.
p27
aa(lp28
VA couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody, Wyoming.
p29
aVIt was in a grizzly bear preserve,
p30
aValthough no one told me that before we went.
p31
aVAnd our guide was a local science teacher.
p32
aVShe was wholly unconcerned about the bears,
p33
aVbut she was terrified of lawyers.
p34
aVThe stories started pouring out.
p35
aVShe'd just been involved in an episode where a parent
p36
aVhad threatened to sue the school
p37
aVbecause she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent
p38
aVwhen he turned the paper in late.
p39
aVThe principal didn't want to stand up to the parent
p40
aVbecause he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings.
p41
aVSo, she had to go to meeting after meeting, same arguments made
p42
aVover and over again.
p43
aVAfter 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulated
p44
aVand raised the grade.
p45
aVShe said, "Life's too short, I just can't keep going with this."
p46
aa(lp47
VAbout the same time, she was going to take two students to a leadership conference
p48
aVin Laramie, which is a couple of hours away,
p49
aVand she was going to drive them in her car,
p50
aVbut the school said, "No, you can't drive them in the car
p51
aVfor liability reasons.
p52
aVYou have to go in a school bus."
p53
aVSo, they provided a bus that held 60 people
p54
aVand drove the three of them back and forth
p55
aVseveral hours to Laramie.
p56
aa(lp57
VHer husband is also a science teacher,
p58
aVand he takes his biology class on a hike
p59
aVin the nearby national park.
p60
aVBut he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year
p61
aVbecause one of the students in the class was disabled,
p62
aVso the other 25 students didn't get to go on the hike either.
p63
aVAt the end of this day I could have filled a book
p64
aVjust with stories about law
p65
aVfrom this one teacher.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, we've been taught to believe that law
p68
aVis the foundation of freedom.
p69
aVBut somehow or another, in the last couple of decades,
p70
aVthe land of the free has become a legal minefield.
p71
aVIt's really changed our lives in ways
p72
aVthat are sort of imperceptible;
p73
aVand yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time.
p74
aVIt's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a
p75
aVpediatrician friend
p76
aVin North Carolina. He said,
p77
aV"Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore.
p78
aVYou wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuff
p79
aVthat might be used against you."
p80
aVThis is a doctor, whose life is caring for people.
p81
aVMy own law firm has a list of questions
p82
aVthat I'm not allowed to ask
p83
aVwhen interviewing candidates,
p84
aVsuch as the sinister question,
p85
aVbulging with hidden motives and innuendo,
p86
aV"Where are you from?"
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VNow for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm
p90
aVthat lawsuits are out of control.
p91
aVAnd we read every once in while
p92
aVabout these crazy lawsuits, like the guy
p93
aVin the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars
p94
aVbecause they lost his pair of pants.
p95
aVThe case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut the reality is, these crazy cases
p98
aVare relatively rare. They don't usually win.
p99
aVAnd the total of direct tort cost
p100
aVin this country is about two percent,
p101
aVwhich is twice as much as in other countries
p102
aVbut, as taxes go, hardly crippling.
p103
aVBut the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg.
p104
aa(lp105
VWhat's happened here, again,
p106
aValmost without our knowing,
p107
aVis our culture has changed.
p108
aVPeople no longer feel free
p109
aVto act on their best judgment.
p110
aVSo, what do we do about it?
p111
aVWe certainly don't want to give up the rights,
p112
aVwhen people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts.
p113
aVWe need regulation to make sure
p114
aVpeople don't pollute and such.
p115
aVWe lack even a vocabulary to deal with
p116
aVthis problem,
p117
aVand that's because we have the wrong frame of reference.
p118
aa(lp119
VWe've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute,
p120
aVevery issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights.
p121
aVAnd so we peer through a legal microscope, and look at everything.
p122
aVIs it possible that there are extenuating circumstances
p123
aVthat explain why Johnny
p124
aVturned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming?
p125
aVIs it possible that the doctor
p126
aVmight have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker?
p127
aVAnd of course the hindsight bias is perfect.
p128
aVThere's always a different scenario that you can sketch out
p129
aVwhere it's possible that something could have been done differently.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd yet, we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope,
p132
aVhoping that we can judge any dispute
p133
aVagainst the standard of a perfect society,
p134
aVwhere everyone will agree what's fair,
p135
aVand where accidents will be extinct,
p136
aVrisk will be no more.
p137
aVOf course, this is Utopia;
p138
aVit's a formula for paralysis, not freedom.
p139
aVIt's not the basis of the rule of law,
p140
aVit's not the basis of a free society.
p141
aVSo, now I have the first of four propositions
p142
aVI'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law:
p143
aVYou've got to judge law mainly
p144
aVby its effect on the broader society,
p145
aVnot individual disputes.
p146
aVAbsolutely vital.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo, let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second
p149
aVand look at our society from high above.
p150
aVIs it working?
p151
aVWhat does the macro-data show us?
p152
aVWell, the healthcare system has been transformed:
p153
aVa culture pervaded with defensiveness,
p154
aVuniversal distrust of the system of justice,
p155
aVuniversal practice of defensive medicine.
p156
aVIt's very hard to measure
p157
aVbecause there are mixed motives.
p158
aVDoctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes,
p159
aVand also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.
p160
aVBut reliable estimates
p161
aVrange between 60 billion and
p162
aV200 billion dollars per year.
p163
aVThat's enough to provide care to all the people
p164
aVin America who don't have it.
p165
aa(lp166
VThe trial lawyers say, "Well, this legal fear
p167
aVmakes doctors practice better medicine."
p168
aVWell that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicine
p169
aVand others. Turns out that's not the case.
p170
aVThe fear has chilled professional interaction
p171
aVso thousands of tragic errors occur
p172
aVbecause doctors are afraid
p173
aVto speak up: "Are you sure that's the right dosage?"
p174
aVBecause they're not sure,
p175
aVand they don't want to take legal responsibility.
p176
aa(lp177
VLet's go to schools.
p178
aVAs we saw with the teacher in Cody, Wyoming,
p179
aVshe seems to be affected by the law.
p180
aVWell it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law.
p181
aVYou could have a separate section of a law library
p182
aVaround each of the following legal concepts:
p183
aVdue process, special education,
p184
aVno child left behind,
p185
aVzero tolerance, work rules ...
p186
aVit goes on. We did a study
p187
aVof all the rules that affect one school
p188
aVin New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea.
p189
aVTens of thousands of discreet rules,
p190
aV60 steps to suspend a student from school:
p191
aVIt's a formula for paralysis.
p192
aVWhat's the effect of that? One is a decline in order.
p193
aa(lp194
VAgain, studies have shown
p195
aVit's directly attributable
p196
aVto the rise of due process.
p197
aVPublic agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago
p198
aVwhere they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in America
p199
aVsay that they spend at least half of their time
p200
aVmaintaining order in the classroom.
p201
aVThat means those students are getting half the learning
p202
aVthey're supposed to, because if one child is disrupting the class
p203
aVno one can learn.
p204
aVAnd what happens when the teacher tries to assert order?
p205
aVThey're threatened with a legal claim.
p206
aVWe also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers
p207
aVin America have been threatened by their students
p208
aVwith violating their rights, with lawsuits
p209
aVby their students. They are threatening, their students.
p210
aVIt's not that they usually sue,
p211
aVit's not that they would win, but it's an
p212
aVindication of the corrosion of authority.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd how has this system of law worked for government?
p215
aVIt doesn't seem to be working very well does it?
p216
aVNeither in Sacramento nor in Washington.
p217
aVThe other day at the State of the Union speech,
p218
aVPresident Obama said,
p219
aVand I think we could all agree with this goal,
p220
aV"From the first railroads to the interstate highway system,
p221
aVour nation has always been the first to compete.
p222
aVThere is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains."
p223
aVWell, actually there is a reason:
p224
aVEnvironmental review has evolved into a process
p225
aVof no pebble left unturned
p226
aVfor any major project taking the better part of a decade,
p227
aVthen followed by years of litigation
p228
aVby anybody who doesn't like the project.
p229
aa(lp230
VThen, just staying above the Earth for one more second,
p231
aVpeople are acting like idiots,
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aVall across the country.
p234
aV(Applause)
p235
aVIdiots. A couple of years ago,
p236
aVBroward County, Florida, banned running at recess.
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVThat means all the boys are going to be ADD.
p239
aVI mean it's just absolutely
p240
aVa formula for failure.
p241
aa(lp242
VMy favorite, though, are all the warning labels.
p243
aV"Caution: Contents are hot,"
p244
aVon billions of coffee cups.
p245
aVArcheologists will dig us up in a thousand years
p246
aVand they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff,
p247
aVbut they'll see all these labels, "Contents are extremely hot."
p248
aVThey'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac.
p249
aVThat's the only explanation. Because why
p250
aVwould you have to tell people that something was actually hot?
p251
aVMy favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure.
p252
aVI grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing.
p253
aVFive-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure,
p254
aVwith a three pronged hook in the back,
p255
aVand outside it said, "Harmful if swallowed."
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VSo, none of these people
p259
aVare doing what they think is right.
p260
aVAnd why not? They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law?
p261
aVBecause it gives us the worst of both worlds:
p262
aVIt's random \u2014 anybody can sue for almost anything
p263
aVand take it to a jury, not even an effort at consistency \u2014
p264
aVand it's also too detailed.
p265
aVIn the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules
p266
aVno human could possibly know it.
p267
aVWell how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimes
p268
aVtrying to prune this legal jungle.
p269
aVBut the challenge here is not one of just
p270
aVamending the law,
p271
aVbecause the hurdle for success is trust.
p272
aa(lp273
VPeople \u2014 for law to be the platform for freedom,
p274
aVpeople have to trust it.
p275
aVSo, that's my second proposition:
p276
aVTrust is an essential condition
p277
aVto a free society.
p278
aVLife is complicated enough without legal fear.
p279
aVBut law is different than other kinds of uncertainties,
p280
aVbecause it carries with it the power of state.
p281
aVAnd so the state can come in.
p282
aVIt actually changes the way people think.
p283
aVIt's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders
p284
aVall day long, whispering in your ear,
p285
aV"Could that go wrong? Might that go wrong?"
p286
aVIt drives people from the smart part of the brain \u2014
p287
aVthat dark, deep well of the subconscious,
p288
aVwhere instincts and experience,
p289
aVand all the other factors of creativity
p290
aVand good judgment are \u2014
p291
aVit drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic.
p292
aa(lp293
VPretty soon the doctor's saying, "Well, I doubt
p294
aVif that headache could be a tumor, but who would protect me
p295
aVif it were? So maybe I'll just order the MRI."
p296
aVThen you've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests.
p297
aVIf you make people self-conscious
p298
aVabout their judgments, studies show
p299
aVyou will make them make worse judgments.
p300
aVIf you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes
p301
aVwhen she's playing the piece, she can't play the piece.
p302
aVSelf-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment.
p303
aVEdison stated it best. He said,
p304
aV"Hell, we ain't got no rules around here,
p305
aVwe're trying to accomplish something."
p306
aV(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VSo, how do you restore trust?
p309
aVTweaking the law's clearly not good enough,
p310
aVand tort reform, which is a great idea,
p311
aVlowers your cost if you're a businessperson,
p312
aVbut it's like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust.
p313
aVStates with extensive tort reform
p314
aVstill suffer all these pathologies.
p315
aVSo, what's needed is not just to limit claims,
p316
aVbut actually create a dry ground of freedom.
p317
aVIt turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure.
p318
aVAnd it is this:
p319
aVLaw sets boundaries,
p320
aVand on one side of those boundaries are all the things
p321
aVyou can't do or must do \u2014
p322
aVyou can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes \u2014
p323
aVbut those same boundaries are supposed to define
p324
aVand protect a dry ground of freedom.
p325
aa(lp326
VIsaiah Berlin put it this way:
p327
aV"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn,
p328
aVwithin which men shall be inviolable."
p329
aVWe've forgotten that second part.
p330
aVThose dikes have burst. People wade through law
p331
aVall day long.
p332
aVSo, what's needed now
p333
aVis to rebuild these boundaries.
p334
aVAnd it's especially important to rebuild them
p335
aVfor lawsuits.
p336
aVBecause what people can sue for establishes the boundaries
p337
aVfor everybody else's freedom.
p338
aVIf someone brings a lawsuit over, "A kid fell off the seesaw,"
p339
aVit doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit,
p340
aVall the seesaws will disappear.
p341
aVBecause no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit.
p342
aVAnd that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms,
p343
aVmerry-go-rounds, climbing ropes,
p344
aVnothing that would interest a kid over the age of four,
p345
aVbecause there's no risk associated with it.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo, how do we rebuild it?
p348
aVLife is too complex for...
p349
aV(Applause)
p350
aVLife is too complex for a software program.
p351
aVAll these choices involve value judgments
p352
aVand social norms, not objective facts.
p353
aVAnd so here is the fourth proposition.
p354
aVThis is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to.
p355
aVAnd there are two essential elements of it:
p356
aVWe have to simplify the law.
p357
aVWe have to migrate from all this complexity
p358
aVtowards general principles and goals.
p359
aVThe constitution is only 16 pages long.
p360
aVWorked pretty well for 200 years.
p361
aa(lp362
VLaw has to be simple enough
p363
aVso that people can internalize it
p364
aVin their daily choices.
p365
aVIf they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.
p366
aVAnd how do you make it simple?
p367
aVBecause life is complex,
p368
aVand here is the hardest and biggest change:
p369
aVWe have to restore the authority
p370
aVto judges and officials
p371
aVto interpret and apply the law.
p372
aV(Applause)
p373
aVWe have to rehumanize the law.
p374
aVTo make law simple so that you feel free,
p375
aVthe people in charge have to be free
p376
aVto use their judgment to interpret and apply the law
p377
aVin accord with reasonable social norms.
p378
aVAs you're going down, and walking down the sidewalk during the day,
p379
aVyou have to think that if there is a dispute,
p380
aVthere's somebody in society who sees it as their job
p381
aVto affirmatively protect you
p382
aVif you're acting reasonably.
p383
aVThat person doesn't exist today.
p384
aa(lp385
VThis is the hardest hurdle.
p386
aVIt's actually not very hard. Ninety-eight percent of cases, this is a piece of cake.
p387
aVMaybe you've got a claim in small claims court
p388
aVfor your lost pair of pants for $100,
p389
aVbut not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars.
p390
aVCase dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court.
p391
aVTakes five minutes. That's it,
p392
aVit's not that hard.
p393
aa(lp394
VBut it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand
p395
aVbecause we woke up in the 1960s
p396
aVto all these really bad values: racism,
p397
aVgender discrimination, pollution \u2014
p398
aVthey were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system
p399
aVwhere no one could have bad values anymore.
p400
aVThe problem is, we created a system
p401
aVwhere we eliminated the right to have good values.
p402
aVIt doesn't mean that people in authority
p403
aVcan do whatever they want.
p404
aVThey're still bounded by legal goals and principles:
p405
aVThe teacher is accountable to the principal,
p406
aVthe judge is accountable to an appellate court,
p407
aVthe president is accountable to voters.
p408
aVBut the accountability's up the line
p409
aVjudging the decision against the effect on everybody,
p410
aVnot just on the disgruntled person.
p411
aVYou can't run a society by the lowest common denominator.
p412
aV(Applause)
p413
aa(lp414
VSo, what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy.
p415
aVWe can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy.
p416
aVWe've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom.
p417
aVIt's not true. Authority, in fact,
p418
aVis essential to freedom.
p419
aVLaw is a human institution;
p420
aVresponsibility is a human institution.
p421
aVIf teachers don't have authority to run the classroom,
p422
aVto maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.
p423
aVIf the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims,
p424
aVthen all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders.
p425
aVIf the environmental agency can't decide
p426
aVthat the power lines are good for the environment,
p427
aVthen there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms
p428
aVto the city.
p429
aVA free society requires red lights and green lights,
p430
aVotherwise it soon descends into gridlock.
p431
aVThat's what's happened to America. Look around.
p432
aa(lp433
VWhat the world needs now
p434
aVis to restore the authority to make common choices.
p435
aVIt's the only way to get our freedom back,
p436
aVand it's the only way to release the energy and passion
p437
aVneeded so that we can meet the challenges
p438
aVof our time. Thank you.
p439

VI'm a computer science professor,
p5
aVand my area of expertise is
p6
aVcomputer and information security.
p7
aVWhen I was in graduate school,
p8
aVI had the opportunity to overhear my grandmother
p9
aVdescribing to one of her fellow senior citizens
p10
aVwhat I did for a living.
p11
aVApparently, I was in charge of making sure that
p12
aVno one stole the computers from the university. (Laughter)
p13
aVAnd, you know, that's a perfectly reasonable thing
p14
aVfor her to think, because I told her I was working
p15
aVin computer security,
p16
aVand it was interesting to get her perspective.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut that's not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard
p19
aVanyone say about my work.
p20
aVThe most ridiculous thing I ever heard is,
p21
aVI was at a dinner party, and a woman heard
p22
aVthat I work in computer security,
p23
aVand she asked me if \u2014 she said her computer had been
p24
aVinfected by a virus, and she was very concerned that she
p25
aVmight get sick from it, that she could get this virus. (Laughter)
p26
aVAnd I'm not a doctor, but I reassured her
p27
aVthat it was very, very unlikely that this would happen,
p28
aVbut if she felt more comfortable, she could be free to use
p29
aVlatex gloves when she was on the computer,
p30
aVand there would be no harm whatsoever in that.
p31
aa(lp32
VI'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get
p33
aVa virus from your computer, in a serious way.
p34
aVWhat I'm going to talk to you about today
p35
aVare some hacks, some real world cyberattacks that people
p36
aVin my community, the academic research community,
p37
aVhave performed, which I don't think
p38
aVmost people know about,
p39
aVand I think they're very interesting and scary,
p40
aVand this talk is kind of a greatest hits
p41
aVof the academic security community's hacks.
p42
aVNone of the work is my work. It's all work
p43
aVthat my colleagues have done, and I actually asked them
p44
aVfor their slides and incorporated them into this talk.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo the first one I'm going to talk about
p47
aVare implanted medical devices.
p48
aVNow medical devices have come a long way technologically.
p49
aVYou can see in 1926 the first pacemaker was invented.
p50
aV1960, the first internal pacemaker was implanted,
p51
aVhopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there,
p52
aVand the technology has continued to move forward.
p53
aVIn 2006, we hit an important milestone from the perspective
p54
aVof computer security.
p55
aVAnd why do I say that?
p56
aVBecause that's when implanted devices inside of people
p57
aVstarted to have networking capabilities.
p58
aVOne thing that brings us close to home is we look
p59
aVat Dick Cheney's device, he had a device that
p60
aVpumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart,
p61
aVand as you can see at the bottom there,
p62
aVit was controlled by a computer controller,
p63
aVand if you ever thought that software liability
p64
aVwas very important, get one of these inside of you.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow what a research team did was they got their hands
p67
aVon what's called an ICD.
p68
aVThis is a defibrillator, and this is a device
p69
aVthat goes into a person to control their heart rhythm,
p70
aVand these have saved many lives.
p71
aVWell, in order to not have to open up the person
p72
aVevery time you want to reprogram their device
p73
aVor do some diagnostics on it, they made the thing be able
p74
aVto communicate wirelessly, and what this research team did
p75
aVis they reverse engineered the wireless protocol,
p76
aVand they built the device you see pictured here,
p77
aVwith a little antenna, that could talk the protocol
p78
aVto the device, and thus control it.
p79
aVIn order to make their experience real \u2014 they were unable
p80
aVto find any volunteers, and so they went
p81
aVand they got some ground beef and some bacon
p82
aVand they wrapped it all up to about the size
p83
aVof a human being's area where the device would go,
p84
aVand they stuck the device inside it
p85
aVto perform their experiment somewhat realistically.
p86
aVThey launched many, many successful attacks.
p87
aVOne that I'll highlight here is changing the patient's name.
p88
aVI don't know why you would want to do that,
p89
aVbut I sure wouldn't want that done to me.
p90
aVAnd they were able to change therapies,
p91
aVincluding disabling the device \u2014 and this is with a real,
p92
aVcommercial, off-the-shelf device \u2014
p93
aVsimply by performing reverse engineering and sending
p94
aVwireless signals to it.
p95
aa(lp96
VThere was a piece on NPR that some of these ICDs
p97
aVcould actually have their performance disrupted
p98
aVsimply by holding a pair of headphones onto them.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, wireless and the Internet
p101
aVcan improve health care greatly.
p102
aVThere's several examples up on the screen
p103
aVof situations where doctors are looking to implant devices
p104
aVinside of people, and all of these devices now,
p105
aVit's standard that they communicate wirelessly,
p106
aVand I think this is great,
p107
aVbut without a full understanding of trustworthy computing,
p108
aVand without understanding what attackers can do
p109
aVand the security risks from the beginning,
p110
aVthere's a lot of danger in this.
p111
aa(lp112
VOkay, let me shift gears and show you another target.
p113
aVI'm going to show you a few different targets like this,
p114
aVand that's my talk. So we'll look at automobiles.
p115
aa(lp116
VThis is a car, and it has a lot of components,
p117
aVa lot of electronics in it today.
p118
aVIn fact, it's got many, many different computers inside of it,
p119
aVmore Pentiums than my lab did when I was in college,
p120
aVand they're connected by a wired network.
p121
aVThere's also a wireless network in the car,
p122
aVwhich can be reached from many different ways.
p123
aVSo there's Bluetooth, there's the FM and XM radio,
p124
aVthere's actually wi-fi, there's sensors in the wheels
p125
aVthat wirelessly communicate the tire pressure
p126
aVto a controller on board.
p127
aVThe modern car is a sophisticated multi-computer device.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd what happens if somebody wanted to attack this?
p130
aVWell, that's what the researchers
p131
aVthat I'm going to talk about today did.
p132
aVThey basically stuck an attacker on the wired network
p133
aVand on the wireless network.
p134
aVNow, they have two areas they can attack.
p135
aVOne is short-range wireless, where you can actually
p136
aVcommunicate with the device from nearby,
p137
aVeither through Bluetooth or wi-fi,
p138
aVand the other is long-range, where you can communicate
p139
aVwith the car through the cellular network,
p140
aVor through one of the radio stations.
p141
aVThink about it. When a car receives a radio signal,
p142
aVit's processed by software.
p143
aVThat software has to receive and decode the radio signal,
p144
aVand then figure out what to do with it,
p145
aVeven if it's just music that it needs to play on the radio,
p146
aVand that software that does that decoding,
p147
aVif it has any bugs in it, could create a vulnerability
p148
aVfor somebody to hack the car.
p149
aa(lp150
VThe way that the researchers did this work is,
p151
aVthey read the software in the computer chips
p152
aVthat were in the car, and then they used sophisticated
p153
aVreverse engineering tools
p154
aVto figure out what that software did,
p155
aVand then they found vulnerabilities in that software,
p156
aVand then they built exploits to exploit those.
p157
aVThey actually carried out their attack in real life.
p158
aVThey bought two cars, and I guess
p159
aVthey have better budgets than I do.
p160
aVThe first threat model was to see what someone could do
p161
aVif an attacker actually got access
p162
aVto the internal network on the car.
p163
aVOkay, so think of that as, someone gets to go to your car,
p164
aVthey get to mess around with it, and then they leave,
p165
aVand now, what kind of trouble are you in?
p166
aVThe other threat model is that they contact you
p167
aVin real time over one of the wireless networks
p168
aVlike the cellular, or something like that,
p169
aVnever having actually gotten physical access to your car.
p170
aa(lp171
VThis is what their setup looks like for the first model,
p172
aVwhere you get to have access to the car.
p173
aVThey put a laptop, and they connected to the diagnostic unit
p174
aVon the in-car network, and they did all kinds of silly things,
p175
aVlike here's a picture of the speedometer
p176
aVshowing 140 miles an hour when the car's in park.
p177
aVOnce you have control of the car's computers,
p178
aVyou can do anything.
p179
aVNow you might say, "Okay, that's silly."
p180
aVWell, what if you make the car always say
p181
aVit's going 20 miles an hour slower than it's actually going?
p182
aVYou might produce a lot of speeding tickets.
p183
aa(lp184
VThen they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars,
p185
aVthe target victim car and the chase car,
p186
aVand they launched a bunch of other attacks.
p187
aVOne of the things they were able to do from the chase car
p188
aVis apply the brakes on the other car,
p189
aVsimply by hacking the computer.
p190
aVThey were able to disable the brakes.
p191
aVThey also were able to install malware that wouldn't kick in
p192
aVand wouldn't trigger until the car was doing something like
p193
aVgoing over 20 miles an hour, or something like that.
p194
aVThe results are astonishing, and when they gave this talk,
p195
aVeven though they gave this talk at a conference
p196
aVto a bunch of computer security researchers,
p197
aVeverybody was gasping.
p198
aVThey were able to take over a bunch of critical computers
p199
aVinside the car: the brakes computer, the lighting computer,
p200
aVthe engine, the dash, the radio, etc.,
p201
aVand they were able to perform these on real commercial
p202
aVcars that they purchased using the radio network.
p203
aVThey were able to compromise every single one of the
p204
aVpieces of software that controlled every single one
p205
aVof the wireless capabilities of the car.
p206
aVAll of these were implemented successfully.
p207
aa(lp208
VHow would you steal a car in this model?
p209
aVWell, you compromise the car by a buffer overflow
p210
aVof vulnerability in the software, something like that.
p211
aVYou use the GPS in the car to locate it.
p212
aVYou remotely unlock the doors through the computer
p213
aVthat controls that, start the engine, bypass anti-theft,
p214
aVand you've got yourself a car.
p215
aa(lp216
VSurveillance was really interesting.
p217
aVThe authors of the study have a video where they show
p218
aVthemselves taking over a car and then turning on
p219
aVthe microphone in the car, and listening in on the car
p220
aVwhile tracking it via GPS on a map,
p221
aVand so that's something that the drivers of the car
p222
aVwould never know was happening.
p223
aa(lp224
VAm I scaring you yet?
p225
aVI've got a few more of these interesting ones.
p226
aVThese are ones where I went to a conference,
p227
aVand my mind was just blown, and I said,
p228
aV"I have to share this with other people."
p229
aa(lp230
VThis was Fabian Monrose's lab
p231
aVat the University of North Carolina, and what they did was
p232
aVsomething intuitive once you see it,
p233
aVbut kind of surprising.
p234
aVThey videotaped people on a bus,
p235
aVand then they post-processed the video.
p236
aVWhat you see here in number one is a
p237
aVreflection in somebody's glasses of the smartphone
p238
aVthat they're typing in.
p239
aVThey wrote software to stabilize \u2014
p240
aVeven though they were on a bus
p241
aVand maybe someone's holding their phone at an angle \u2014
p242
aVto stabilize the phone, process it, and
p243
aVyou may know on your smartphone, when you type
p244
aVa password, the keys pop out a little bit, and they were able
p245
aVto use that to reconstruct what the person was typing,
p246
aVand had a language model for detecting typing.
p247
aVWhat was interesting is, by videotaping on a bus,
p248
aVthey were able to produce exactly what people
p249
aVon their smartphones were typing,
p250
aVand then they had a surprising result, which is that
p251
aVtheir software had not only done it for their target,
p252
aVbut other people who accidentally happened
p253
aVto be in the picture, they were able to produce
p254
aVwhat those people had been typing, and that was kind of
p255
aVan accidental artifact of what their software was doing.
p256
aa(lp257
VI'll show you two more. One is P25 radios.
p258
aVP25 radios are used by law enforcement
p259
aVand all kinds of government agencies
p260
aVand people in combat to communicate,
p261
aVand there's an encryption option on these phones.
p262
aVThis is what the phone looks like. It's not really a phone.
p263
aVIt's more of a two-way radio.
p264
aVMotorola makes the most widely used one, and you can see
p265
aVthat they're used by Secret Service, they're used in combat,
p266
aVit's a very, very common standard in the U.S. and elsewhere.
p267
aVSo one question the researchers asked themselves is,
p268
aVcould you block this thing, right?
p269
aVCould you run a denial-of-service,
p270
aVbecause these are first responders?
p271
aVSo, would a terrorist organization want to black out the
p272
aVability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency?
p273
aVThey found that there's this GirlTech device used for texting
p274
aVthat happens to operate at the same exact frequency
p275
aVas the P25, and they built what they called
p276
aVMy First Jammer. (Laughter)
p277
aVIf you look closely at this device,
p278
aVit's got a switch for encryption or cleartext.
p279
aVLet me advance the slide, and now I'll go back.
p280
aVYou see the difference?
p281
aVThis is plain text. This is encrypted.
p282
aVThere's one little dot that shows up on the screen,
p283
aVand one little tiny turn of the switch.
p284
aVAnd so the researchers asked themselves, "I wonder how
p285
aVmany times very secure, important, sensitive conversations
p286
aVare happening on these two-way radios where they forget
p287
aVto encrypt and they don't notice that they didn't encrypt?"
p288
aa(lp289
VSo they bought a scanner. These are perfectly legal
p290
aVand they run at the frequency of the P25,
p291
aVand what they did is they hopped around frequencies
p292
aVand they wrote software to listen in.
p293
aVIf they found encrypted communication, they stayed
p294
aVon that channel and they wrote down, that's a channel
p295
aVthat these people communicate in,
p296
aVthese law enforcement agencies,
p297
aVand they went to 20 metropolitan areas and listened in
p298
aVon conversations that were happening at those frequencies.
p299
aVThey found that in every metropolitan area,
p300
aVthey would capture over 20 minutes a day
p301
aVof cleartext communication.
p302
aVAnd what kind of things were people talking about?
p303
aVWell, they found the names and information
p304
aVabout confidential informants. They found information
p305
aVthat was being recorded in wiretaps,
p306
aVa bunch of crimes that were being discussed,
p307
aVsensitive information.
p308
aVIt was mostly law enforcement and criminal.
p309
aVThey went and reported this to the law enforcement
p310
aVagencies, after anonymizing it,
p311
aVand the vulnerability here is simply the user interface
p312
aVwasn't good enough. If you're talking
p313
aVabout something really secure and sensitive, it should
p314
aVbe really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted.
p315
aVThat one's pretty easy to fix.
p316
aa(lp317
VThe last one I thought was really, really cool,
p318
aVand I just had to show it to you, it's probably not something
p319
aVthat you're going to lose sleep over
p320
aVlike the cars or the defibrillators,
p321
aVbut it's stealing keystrokes.
p322
aVNow, we've all looked at smartphones upside down.
p323
aVEvery security expert wants to hack a smartphone,
p324
aVand we tend to look at the USB port, the GPS for tracking,
p325
aVthe camera, the microphone, but no one up till this point
p326
aVhad looked at the accelerometer.
p327
aVThe accelerometer is the thing that determines
p328
aVthe vertical orientation of the smartphone.
p329
aVAnd so they had a simple setup.
p330
aVThey put a smartphone next to a keyboard,
p331
aVand they had people type, and then their goal was
p332
aVto use the vibrations that were created by typing
p333
aVto measure the change in the accelerometer reading
p334
aVto determine what the person had been typing.
p335
aVNow, when they tried this on an iPhone 3GS,
p336
aVthis is a graph of the perturbations that were created
p337
aVby the typing, and you can see that it's very difficult
p338
aVto tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing,
p339
aVbut the iPhone 4 greatly improved the accelerometer,
p340
aVand so the same measurement
p341
aVproduced this graph.
p342
aVNow that gave you a lot of information while someone
p343
aVwas typing, and what they did then is used advanced
p344
aVartificial intelligence techniques called machine learning
p345
aVto have a training phase,
p346
aVand so they got most likely grad students
p347
aVto type in a whole lot of things, and to learn,
p348
aVto have the system use the machine learning tools that
p349
aVwere available to learn what it is that the people were typing
p350
aVand to match that up
p351
aVwith the measurements in the accelerometer.
p352
aVAnd then there's the attack phase, where you get
p353
aVsomebody to type something in, you don't know what it was,
p354
aVbut you use your model that you created
p355
aVin the training phase to figure out what they were typing.
p356
aVThey had pretty good success. This is an article from the USA Today.
p357
aVThey typed in, "The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled
p358
aVthat Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago"
p359
aV\u2014 see, I tied it in to the last talk \u2014
p360
aV"and ordered him to stay on the ballot."
p361
aVNow, the system is interesting, because it produced
p362
aV"Illinois Supreme" and then it wasn't sure.
p363
aVThe model produced a bunch of options,
p364
aVand this is the beauty of some of the A.I. techniques,
p365
aVis that computers are good at some things,
p366
aVhumans are good at other things,
p367
aVtake the best of both and let the humans solve this one.
p368
aVDon't waste computer cycles.
p369
aVA human's not going to think it's the Supreme might.
p370
aVIt's the Supreme Court, right?
p371
aVAnd so, together we're able to reproduce typing
p372
aVsimply by measuring the accelerometer.
p373
aVWhy does this matter? Well, in the Android platform,
p374
aVfor example, the developers have a manifest
p375
aVwhere every device on there, the microphone, etc.,
p376
aVhas to register if you're going to use it
p377
aVso that hackers can't take over it,
p378
aVbut nobody controls the accelerometer.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo what's the point? You can leave your iPhone next to
p381
aVsomeone's keyboard, and just leave the room,
p382
aVand then later recover what they did,
p383
aVeven without using the microphone.
p384
aVIf someone is able to put malware on your iPhone,
p385
aVthey could then maybe get the typing that you do
p386
aVwhenever you put your iPhone next to your keyboard.
p387
aa(lp388
VThere's several other notable attacks that unfortunately
p389
aVI don't have time to go into, but the one that I wanted
p390
aVto point out was a group from the University of Michigan
p391
aVwhich was able to take voting machines,
p392
aVthe Sequoia AVC Edge DREs that
p393
aVwere going to be used in New Jersey in the election
p394
aVthat were left in a hallway, and put Pac-Man on it.
p395
aVSo they ran the Pac-Man game.
p396
aa(lp397
VWhat does this all mean?
p398
aVWell, I think that society tends to adopt technology
p399
aVreally quickly. I love the next coolest gadget.
p400
aVBut it's very important, and these researchers are showing,
p401
aVthat the developers of these things
p402
aVneed to take security into account from the very beginning,
p403
aVand need to realize that they may have a threat model,
p404
aVbut the attackers may not be nice enough
p405
aVto limit themselves to that threat model,
p406
aVand so you need to think outside of the box.
p407
aa(lp408
VWhat we can do is be aware
p409
aVthat devices can be compromised,
p410
aVand anything that has software in it
p411
aVis going to be vulnerable. It's going to have bugs.
p412
aVThank you very much. (Applause)

VI'm a lifelong traveler.
p5
aVEven as a little kid,
p6
aVI was actually working out that it would be cheaper
p7
aVto go to boarding school in England
p8
aVthan just to the best school down the road from my parents' house in California.
p9
aVSo, from the time I was nine years old
p10
aVI was flying alone several times a year
p11
aVover the North Pole, just to go to school.
p12
aVAnd of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly,
p13
aVso the very week after I graduated from high school,
p14
aVI got a job mopping tables
p15
aVso that I could spend every season of my 18th year
p16
aVon a different continent.
p17
aVAnd then, almost inevitably, I became a travel writer
p18
aVso my job and my joy could become one.
p19
aVAnd I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough
p20
aVto walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet
p21
aVor to wander along the seafronts in Havana
p22
aVwith music passing all around you,
p23
aVyou could bring those sounds  and the high cobalt skies
p24
aVand the flash of the blue ocean
p25
aVback to your friends at home,
p26
aVand really bring some magic
p27
aVand clarity to your own life.
p28
aVExcept, as you all know,
p29
aVone of the first things you learn when you travel
p30
aVis that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it.
p31
aVYou take an angry man to the Himalayas,
p32
aVhe just starts complaining about the food.
p33
aVAnd I found that the best way
p34
aVthat I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes
p35
aVwas, oddly,
p36
aVby going nowhere, just by sitting still.
p37
aVAnd of course sitting still is how many of us get
p38
aVwhat we most crave and need in our accelerated lives, a break.
p39
aVBut it was also the only way
p40
aVthat I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience
p41
aVand make sense of the future and the past.
p42
aVAnd so, to my great surprise,
p43
aVI found that going nowhere
p44
aVwas at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba.
p45
aVAnd by going nowhere, I mean nothing more intimidating
p46
aVthan taking a few minutes out of every day
p47
aVor a few days out of every season,
p48
aVor even, as some people do,
p49
aVa few years out of a life
p50
aVin order to sit still long enough
p51
aVto find out what moves you most,
p52
aVto recall where your truest happiness lies
p53
aVand to remember that sometimes
p54
aVmaking a living and making a life
p55
aVpoint in opposite directions.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd of course, this is what wise beings through the centuries
p58
aVfrom every tradition have been telling us.
p59
aVIt's an old idea.
p60
aVMore than 2,000 years ago,  the Stoics were reminding us
p61
aVit's not our experience that makes our lives,
p62
aVit's what we do with it.
p63
aVImagine a hurricane suddenly  sweeps through your town
p64
aVand reduces every last thing to rubble.
p65
aVOne man is traumatized for life.
p66
aVBut another, maybe even his brother, almost feels liberated,
p67
aVand decides this is a great chance to start his life anew.
p68
aVIt's exactly the same event,
p69
aVbut radically different responses.
p70
aVThere is nothing either good or bad, as Shakespeare told us in "Hamlet,"
p71
aVbut thinking makes it so.
p72
aVAnd this has certainly been my experience as a traveler.
p73
aVTwenty-four years ago I took  the most mind-bending trip
p74
aVacross North Korea.
p75
aVBut the trip lasted a few days.
p76
aVWhat I've done with it sitting still, going back to it in my head,
p77
aVtrying to understand it, finding a place for it in my thinking,
p78
aVthat's lasted 24 years already
p79
aVand will probably last a lifetime.
p80
aVThe trip, in other words, gave me some amazing sights,
p81
aVbut it's only sitting still
p82
aVthat allows me to turn those into lasting insights.
p83
aVAnd I sometimes think that so much of our life
p84
aVtakes place inside our heads,
p85
aVin memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation,
p86
aVthat if I really want to change my life
p87
aVI might best begin by changing my mind.
p88
aVAgain, none of this is new;
p89
aVthat's why Shakespeare and the Stoics were telling us this centuries ago,
p90
aVbut Shakespeare never had to face 200 emails in a day.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVThe Stoics, as far as I know, were not on Facebook.
p93
aVWe all know that in our on-demand lives,
p94
aVone of the things that's most on demand
p95
aVis ourselves.
p96
aVWherever we are, any time of night or day,
p97
aVour bosses, junk-mailers, our parents can get to us.
p98
aVSociologists have actually found that in recent years
p99
aVAmericans are working fewer hours than 50 years ago,
p100
aVbut we feel as if we're working more.
p101
aVWe have more and more time-saving devices,
p102
aVbut sometimes, it seems, less and less time.
p103
aVWe can more and more easily  make contact with people
p104
aVon the furthest corners of the planet,
p105
aVbut sometimes in that process
p106
aVwe lose contact with ourselves.
p107
aVAnd one of my biggest surprises  as a traveler
p108
aVhas been to find that often it's exactly the people
p109
aVwho have most enabled us to get anywhere
p110
aVwho are intent on going nowhere.
p111
aVIn other words, precisely those beings
p112
aVwho have created the technologies
p113
aVthat override so many of the limits of old,
p114
aVare the ones wisest about the need for limits,
p115
aVeven when it comes to technology.
p116
aVI once went to the Google headquarters
p117
aVand I saw all the things many of you have heard about;
p118
aVthe indoor tree houses, the trampolines,
p119
aVworkers at that time enjoying 20 percent of their paid time free
p120
aVso that they could just let their imaginations go wandering.
p121
aVBut what impressed me even more
p122
aVwas that as I was waiting for my digital I.D.,
p123
aVone Googler was telling me about the program
p124
aVthat he was about to start to teach the many, many Googlers
p125
aVwho practice yoga to become trainers in it,
p126
aVand the other Googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write
p127
aVon the inner search engine,
p128
aVand the ways in which science has empirically shown
p129
aVthat sitting still, or meditation,
p130
aVcan lead not just to better  health or to clearer thinking,
p131
aVbut even to emotional intelligence.
p132
aVI have another friend in Silicon Valley
p133
aVwho is really one  of the most eloquent spokesmen
p134
aVfor the latest technologies,
p135
aVand in fact was one of the founders of Wired magazine, Kevin Kelly.
p136
aVAnd Kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies
p137
aVwithout a smartphone or a laptop or a TV in his home.
p138
aVAnd like many in Silicon Valley,
p139
aVhe tries really hard to observe
p140
aVwhat they call an Internet sabbath,
p141
aVwhereby for 24 or 48 hours every week
p142
aVthey go completely offline
p143
aVin order to gather the sense of direction
p144
aVand proportion they'll need  when they go online again.
p145
aVThe one thing perhaps that technology hasn't always given us
p146
aVis a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology.
p147
aVAnd when you speak of the sabbath,
p148
aVlook at the Ten Commandments \u2014
p149
aVthere's only one word there for which the adjective "holy" is used,
p150
aVand that's the Sabbath.
p151
aVI pick up the Jewish holy book of the Torah \u2014
p152
aVits longest chapter, it's on the Sabbath.
p153
aVAnd we all know that it's really one of our greatest luxuries,
p154
aVthe empty space.
p155
aVIn many a piece of music,  it's the pause or the rest
p156
aVthat gives the piece its beauty and its shape.
p157
aVAnd I know I as a writer
p158
aVwill often try to include a lot of empty space on the page
p159
aVso that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences
p160
aVand so that her imagination has room to breathe.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow, in the physical domain,  of course, many people,
p163
aVif they have the resources,
p164
aVwill try to get a place in the country, a second home.
p165
aVI've never begun to have those resources,
p166
aVbut I sometimes remember that any time I want,
p167
aVI can get a second home in time, if not in space,
p168
aVjust by taking a day off.
p169
aVAnd it's never easy because, of course,  whenever I do I spend much of it
p170
aVworried about all the extra stuff
p171
aVthat's going to crash down on me the following day.
p172
aVI sometimes think I'd rather give up meat or sex or wine
p173
aVthan the chance to check on my emails.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVAnd every season I do try to take three days off on retreat
p176
aVbut a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind
p177
aVand to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails
p178
aVfrom my bosses
p179
aVand maybe to be missing a friend's birthday party.
p180
aVBut as soon as I get to a place of real quiet,
p181
aVI realize that it's only by going there
p182
aVthat I'll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share
p183
aVwith my wife or bosses or friends.
p184
aVOtherwise, really,
p185
aVI'm just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness,
p186
aVwhich is no blessing at all.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd so when I was 29,
p189
aVI decided to remake my entire life
p190
aVin the light of going nowhere.
p191
aVOne evening I was coming back from the office,
p192
aVit was after midnight, I was in a taxi driving through Times Square,
p193
aVand I suddenly realized that I was racing around so much
p194
aVI could never catch up with my life.
p195
aVAnd my life then, as it happened,
p196
aVwas pretty much the one I might have dreamed of as a little boy.
p197
aVI had really interesting friends and colleagues,
p198
aVI had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and 20th Street.
p199
aVI had, to me, a fascinating job  writing about world affairs,
p200
aVbut I could never separate myself enough from them
p201
aVto hear myself think \u2014
p202
aVor really, to understand if I was truly happy.
p203
aVAnd so, I abandoned my dream life
p204
aVfor a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto, Japan,
p205
aVwhich was the place that had long exerted a strong,
p206
aVreally mysterious gravitational pull on me.
p207
aVEven as a child
p208
aVI would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it;
p209
aVI knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.
p210
aVBut it's also, as you all know,
p211
aVa beautiful city encircled by hills,
p212
aVfilled with more than 2,000 temples and shrines,
p213
aVwhere people have been sitting still for 800 years or more.
p214
aVAnd quite soon after I moved there, I ended up where I still am
p215
aVwith my wife, formerly our kids,
p216
aVin a two-room apartment in the middle of nowhere
p217
aVwhere we have no bicycle, no car,
p218
aVno TV I can understand,
p219
aVand I still have to support my loved ones
p220
aVas a travel writer and a journalist,
p221
aVso clearly this is not ideal for job advancement
p222
aVor for cultural excitement
p223
aVor for social diversion.
p224
aVBut I realized that it gives me what I prize most,
p225
aVwhich is days
p226
aVand hours.
p227
aVI have never once had to use a cell phone there.
p228
aVI almost never have to look at the time,
p229
aVand every morning when I wake up,
p230
aVreally the day stretches in front of me
p231
aVlike an open meadow.
p232
aVAnd when life throws up one of its nasty surprises,
p233
aVas it will, more than once,
p234
aVwhen a doctor comes into my room
p235
aVwearing a grave expression,
p236
aVor a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway,
p237
aVI know, in my bones,
p238
aVthat it's the time I've spent going nowhere
p239
aVthat is going to sustain me much more
p240
aVthan all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.
p241
aa(lp242
VI'll always be a traveler \u2014
p243
aVmy livelihood depends on it \u2014
p244
aVbut one of the beauties of travel
p245
aVis that it allows you to bring stillness
p246
aVinto the motion and the commotion of the world.
p247
aVI once got on a plane in Frankfurt, Germany,
p248
aVand a young German woman  came down and sat next to me
p249
aVand engaged me in a very friendly conversation
p250
aVfor about 30 minutes,
p251
aVand then she just turned around
p252
aVand sat still for 12 hours.
p253
aVShe didn't once turn on her video monitor,
p254
aVshe never pulled out a book, she didn't even go to sleep,
p255
aVshe just sat still,
p256
aVand something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me.
p257
aVI've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days
p258
aVto try to open up a space inside their lives.
p259
aVSome people go to black-hole resorts
p260
aVwhere they'll spend hundreds of dollars a night
p261
aVin order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop
p262
aVto the front desk on arrival.
p263
aVSome people I know, just before they go to sleep,
p264
aVinstead of scrolling through their messages
p265
aVor checking out YouTube,
p266
aVjust turn out the lights and listen to some music,
p267
aVand notice that they sleep much better
p268
aVand wake up much refreshed.
p269
aVI was once fortunate enough
p270
aVto drive into the high, dark mountains behind Los Angeles,
p271
aVwhere the great poet and singer
p272
aVand international heartthrob Leonard Cohen
p273
aVwas living and working for many years as a full-time monk
p274
aVin the Mount Baldy Zen Center.
p275
aVAnd I wasn't entirely surprised
p276
aVwhen the record that he released at the age of 77,
p277
aVto which he gave the deliberately  unsexy title of "Old Ideas,"
p278
aVwent to number one in the charts  in 17 nations in the world,
p279
aVhit the top five in nine others.
p280
aVSomething in us, I think, is crying out
p281
aVfor the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that.
p282
aVwho take the time and trouble to sit still.
p283
aVAnd I think many of us have the sensation,
p284
aVI certainly do,
p285
aVthat we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen,
p286
aVand it's noisy and it's crowded
p287
aVand it's changing with every second,
p288
aVand that screen is our lives.
p289
aVAnd it's only by stepping back, and then further back,
p290
aVand holding still,
p291
aVthat we can begin to see what the canvas means
p292
aVand to catch the larger picture.
p293
aVAnd a few people do that for us by going nowhere.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo, in an age of acceleration,
p296
aVnothing can be more exhilarating than going slow.
p297
aVAnd in an age of distraction,
p298
aVnothing is so luxurious as paying attention.
p299
aVAnd in an age of constant movement,
p300
aVnothing is so urgent as sitting still.
p301
aVSo you can go on your next vacation
p302
aVto Paris or Hawaii, or New Orleans;
p303
aVI bet you'll have a wonderful time.
p304
aVBut, if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope,
p305
aVin love with the world,
p306
aVI think you might want to try considering going nowhere.
p307
aVThank you.
p308
aV(Applause)

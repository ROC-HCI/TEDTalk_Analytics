VI'm a very lucky person.
p5
aVI've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth
p6
aVand the people and creatures that live on it.
p7
aVAnd my passion was inspired at the age of seven,
p8
aVwhen my parents first took me to Morocco,
p9
aVat the edge of the Sahara Desert.
p10
aVNow imagine a little Brit
p11
aVsomewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home.
p12
aVWhat an amazing experience.
p13
aVAnd it made me want to explore more.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo as a filmmaker,
p16
aVI've been from one end of the Earth to the other
p17
aVtrying to get the perfect shot
p18
aVand to capture animal behavior never seen before.
p19
aVAnd what's more, I'm really lucky,
p20
aVbecause I get to share that with millions of people worldwide.
p21
aVNow the idea of having new perspectives of our planet
p22
aVand actually being able to get that message out
p23
aVgets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step.
p24
aa(lp25
VYou might think that it's quite hard
p26
aVto find new stories and new subjects,
p27
aVbut new technology is changing the way we can film.
p28
aVIt's enabling us to get fresh, new images
p29
aVand tell brand new stories.
p30
aVIn Nature's Great Events,
p31
aVa series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough,
p32
aVwe wanted to do just that.
p33
aa(lp34
VImages of grizzly bears are pretty familiar.
p35
aVYou see them all the time, you think.
p36
aVBut there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see
p37
aVand had never been filmed.
p38
aVSo what we did, we went to Alaska,
p39
aVwhich is where the grizzlies rely
p40
aVon really high, almost inaccessible, mountain slopes
p41
aVfor their denning.
p42
aVAnd the only way to film that is a shoot from the air.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Video) David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia,
p45
aVthousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep.
p46
aVThere is nothing to eat up here,
p47
aVbut the conditions were ideal for hibernation.
p48
aVLots of snow in which to dig a den.
p49
aVTo find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast,
p50
aVwhere the snow will already be melting.
p51
aVBut getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.
p52
aVThese mountains are dangerous places,
p53
aVbut ultimately the fate of these bear families,
p54
aVand indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific,
p55
aVdepends on the salmon.
p56
aa(lp57
VKB: I love that shot.
p58
aVI always get goosebumps every time I see it.
p59
aVThat was filmed from a helicopter
p60
aVusing a gyro-stabilized camera.
p61
aVAnd it's a wonderful bit of gear,
p62
aVbecause it's like having a flying tripod, crane and dolly all rolled into one.
p63
aVBut technology alone isn't enough.
p64
aVTo really get the money shots,
p65
aVit's down to being in the right place at the right time.
p66
aVAnd that sequence was especially difficult.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe first year we got nothing.
p69
aVWe had to go back the following year,
p70
aVall the way back to the remote parts of Alaska.
p71
aVAnd we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks.
p72
aVAnd eventually we got lucky.
p73
aVThe cloud lifted, the wind was still,
p74
aVand even the bear showed up.
p75
aVAnd we managed to get that magic moment.
p76
aa(lp77
VFor a filmmaker,
p78
aVnew technology is an amazing tool,
p79
aVbut the other thing that really, really excites me
p80
aVis when new species are discovered.
p81
aVNow, when I heard about one animal,
p82
aVI knew we had to get it for my next series,
p83
aVUntamed Americas, for National Geographic.
p84
aVIn 2005, a new species of bat was discovered
p85
aVin the cloud forests of Ecuador.
p86
aVAnd what was amazing about that discovery
p87
aVis that it also solved the mystery
p88
aVof what pollinated a unique flower.
p89
aVIt depends solely on the bat.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, the series hasn't even aired yet,
p92
aVso you're the very first to see this.
p93
aVSee what you think.
p94
aV(Video) Narrator: The tube-lipped nectar bat.
p95
aVA pool of delicious nectar
p96
aVlies at the bottom of each flower's long flute.
p97
aVBut how to reach it?
p98
aVNecessity is the mother of evolution.
p99
aV(Music)
p100
aVThis two-and-a-half-inch bat
p101
aVhas a three-and-a-half-inch tongue,
p102
aVthe longest relative to body length
p103
aVof any mammal in the world.
p104
aVIf human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.
p105
aV(Applause)
p106
aVKB: What a tongue.
p107
aVWe filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower
p108
aVand using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times.
p109
aVSo imagine how quick that thing is in real life.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow people often ask me, "Where's your favorite place on the planet?"
p112
aVAnd the truth is I just don't have one.
p113
aVThere are so many wonderful places.
p114
aVBut some locations draw you back time and time again.
p115
aVAnd one remote location \u2014
p116
aVI first went there as a backpacker;
p117
aVI've been back several times for filming,
p118
aVmost recently for Untamed Americas \u2014
p119
aVit's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America,
p120
aVand it's the most otherworldly place I know.
p121
aVBut at 15,000 feet, it's tough.
p122
aVIt's freezing cold,
p123
aVand that thin air really gets you.
p124
aVSometimes it's hard to breathe,
p125
aVespecially carrying all the heavy filming equipment.
p126
aVAnd that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover.
p127
aVBut the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere
p128
aVis that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens
p129
aVwith amazing clarity.
p130
aVHave a look.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Video) Narrator: Some 1,500 miles south of the tropics,
p133
aVbetween Chile and Bolivia,
p134
aVthe Andes completely change.
p135
aVIt's called the Altiplano, or "high plains" \u2014
p136
aVa place of extremes
p137
aVand extreme contrasts.
p138
aVWhere deserts freeze
p139
aVand waters boil.
p140
aVMore like Mars than Earth,
p141
aVit seems just as hostile to life.
p142
aVThe stars themselves \u2014
p143
aVat 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air
p144
aVmakes for perfect stargazing.
p145
aVSome of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.
p146
aVBut just looking up with the naked eye,
p147
aVyou really don't need one.
p148
aV(Music)
p149
aV(Applause)
p150
aa(lp151
VKB: Thank you so much
p152
aVfor letting me share some images
p153
aVof our magnificent, wonderful Earth.
p154
aVThank you for letting me share that with you.

and producer with a passion for travel and natural history. In 20 years at the BBC&rsquo;s Natural History Unit, Bass made wildlife films in almost every environment across the Earth, from the rainforests of the Congo (where she produced the first-ever film of our closest relative, the bonobo), to the deserts of Libya, Syria and Jordan, from the icy peaks of the Andes to the swamps of the Amazon, from erupting volcanoes in the Caribbean to the nocturnal world of raccoons in downtown Manhattan. Her series include <em>Andes to Amazon</em>, exploring the wildlife and extreme landscapes of South America; <em>Jungle</em>, an investigation of the world&rsquo;s rainforests; <em>Wild</em> <em>Caribbean</em>, about the varied nature, weather and landscapes of the Caribbean; and <em>Nature&rsquo;s Great Events</em>, a dramatic portrayal of six of the planet&rsquo;s most spectacular wildlife events. </p><p>Bass is now producing <a href=\\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/05/05/untamed-americas-sneak-peek/\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Untamed Americas</em></a>, an epic series on the natural history of North, South and Central America, for National Geographic Television. The series is set to premiere in June 2012.</p><p>Her passion for travel and natural history were evident from an early age, and she has travelled widely on all the continents -- on scientific expeditions, for pleasure and to make films. In recent years she has sought out dragons on Komodo, dived the remote coral reefs of New Guinea, hang-glided over the cliffs of Byron Bay in Australia, climbed active volcanoes in Ethiopia, rafted the length of the Grand Canyon, sailed a traditional dhow in the Indian Ocean and trekked with camels through the Sahara.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "karen_bass", "whotheyare": "Karen Bass has

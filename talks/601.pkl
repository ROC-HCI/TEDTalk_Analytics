VSo I am a pediatric cancer doctor
p5
aVand stem-cell researcher at Stanford University
p6
aVwhere my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.
p7
aVNow, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year,
p8
aVI didn't bring a human brain,
p9
aVbut I did bring a liter of bone marrow.
p10
aVAnd bone marrow is actually what we use
p11
aVto save the lives of tens of thousands of patients,
p12
aVmost of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma
p13
aVand some other diseases.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.
p16
aVI'm in the operating room. We have Bob here,
p17
aVwho is a volunteer donor.
p18
aVWe're sending his marrow across the country to save the life
p19
aVof a child with leukemia.
p20
aVSo actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?
p21
aVWell we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses,
p22
aVand another doctor across from me.
p23
aVBob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle,
p24
aVyou know, not too big.
p25
aVAnd the way we do this is we basically
p26
aVplace this through the soft tissue,
p27
aVand kind of punch it into the hard bone,
p28
aVinto the tuchus \u2014 that's a technical term \u2014
p29
aVand aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,
p30
aVeach time, with a syringe.
p31
aVAnd hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.
p32
aVHands it back to me. And we do that again and again.
p33
aVAbout 200 times usually.
p34
aVAnd by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,
p35
aVlet alone Bob,
p36
aVwhose rear end looks something more like this,
p37
aVlike Swiss cheese.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.
p40
aVAnd there is probably a better way to do this.
p41
aVSo I thought of a minimally invasive approach,
p42
aVand a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.
p43
aVThis is it.
p44
aVAnd the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.
p45
aa(lp46
VOur standard see-through patient.
p47
aVInstead of entering the bone dozens of times,
p48
aVwe enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.
p49
aVAnd we have a flexible, powered catheter
p50
aVwith a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow
p51
aVand follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.
p52
aVSo it enables you to very rapidly aspirate,
p53
aVor suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.
p54
aVWe can do multiple passes through that same entry.
p55
aVNo robots required.
p56
aVAnd, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia,
p57
aVand do this harvest as an outpatient.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.
p60
aVAnd played around with this a little bit.
p61
aVAnd our team members developed this technology.
p62
aVAnd eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.
p63
aVAnd we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out,
p64
aVbut we got 10 times the stem cell activity
p65
aVin the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.
p66
aVThis device was just FDA approved in the last year.
p67
aa(lp68
VHere is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.
p69
aVThere will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.
p70
aVThis was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.
p71
aVAnd we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells
p72
aVthan the standard approach done on the same patient.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.
p75
aVYou all know about embryonic stem cells.
p76
aVThey've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.
p77
aVAdult stem cells are throughout our body,
p78
aVincluding the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,
p79
aVwhich we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy
p80
aVfor over 40 years.
p81
aVIn the last decade there's been an explosion of use
p82
aVof bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases
p83
aVsuch as heart disease, vascular disease,
p84
aVorthopedics, tissue engineering,
p85
aVeven in neurology to treat Parkinson's
p86
aVand diabetes.
p87
aa(lp88
VWe've just come out, we're commercializing, this year,
p89
aVgeneration 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.
p90
aVThe hope is that this gets more stem cells out,
p91
aVwhich translates to better outcomes.
p92
aVIt may encourage more people to sign up to be
p93
aVpotential live-saving bone marrow donors.
p94
aVIt may even enable you to bank
p95
aVyour own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier,
p96
aVto use in the future should you need it.
p97
aVAnd ultimately \u2014 and here's a picture of our
p98
aVbone marrow transplant survivors,
p99
aVwho come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.
p100
aVHopefully this technology will let us
p101
aVhave more of these survivors in the future.
p102
aVThanks.

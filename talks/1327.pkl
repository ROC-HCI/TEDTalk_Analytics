VOne of the most common ways of dividing the world
p5
aVis into those who believe
p6
aVand those who don't \u2014
p7
aVinto the religious and the atheists.
p8
aVAnd for the last decade or so,
p9
aVit's been quite clear
p10
aVwhat being an atheist means.
p11
aVThere have been some very vocal atheists
p12
aVwho've pointed out,
p13
aVnot just that religion is wrong,
p14
aVbut that it's ridiculous.
p15
aVThese people, many of whom have lived in North Oxford,
p16
aVhave argued \u2014
p17
aVthey've argued that believing in God
p18
aVis akin to believing in fairies
p19
aVand essentially that the whole thing
p20
aVis a childish game.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow I think it's too easy.
p23
aVI think it's too easy
p24
aVto dismiss the whole of religion that way.
p25
aVAnd it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.
p26
aVAnd what I'd like to inaugurate today
p27
aVis a new way of being an atheist \u2014
p28
aVif you like, a new version of atheism
p29
aVwe could call Atheism 2.0.
p30
aVNow what is Atheism 2.0?
p31
aVWell it starts from a very basic premise:
p32
aVof course, there's no God.
p33
aVOf course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits
p34
aVor angels, etc.
p35
aVNow let's move on; that's not the end of the story,
p36
aVthat's the very, very beginning.
p37
aa(lp38
VI'm interested in the kind of constituency
p39
aVthat thinks something along these lines:
p40
aVthat thinks, "I can't believe in any of this stuff.
p41
aVI can't believe in the doctrines.
p42
aVI don't think these doctrines are right.
p43
aVBut," a very important but, "I love Christmas carols.
p44
aVI really like the art of Mantegna.
p45
aVI really like looking at old churches.
p46
aVI really like turning the pages of the Old Testament."
p47
aVWhatever it may be,
p48
aVyou know the kind of thing I'm talking about \u2014
p49
aVpeople who are attracted to the ritualistic side,
p50
aVthe moralistic, communal side of religion,
p51
aVbut can't bear the doctrine.
p52
aVUntil now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.
p53
aVIt's almost as though either you accept the doctrine
p54
aVand then you can have all the nice stuff,
p55
aVor you reject the doctrine and
p56
aVyou're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland
p57
aVunder the guidance of CNN and Walmart.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo that's a sort of tough choice.
p60
aVI don't think we have to make that choice.
p61
aVI think there is an alternative.
p62
aVI think there are ways \u2014
p63
aVand I'm being both very respectful and completely impious \u2014
p64
aVof stealing from religions.
p65
aVIf you don't believe in a religion,
p66
aVthere's nothing wrong with picking and mixing,
p67
aVwith taking out the best sides of religion.
p68
aVAnd for me, atheism 2.0
p69
aVis about both, as I say,
p70
aVa respectful and an impious way
p71
aVof going through religions and saying, "What here could we use?"
p72
aVThe secular world is full of holes.
p73
aVWe have secularized badly, I would argue.
p74
aVAnd a thorough study of religion
p75
aVcould give us all sorts of insights
p76
aVinto areas of life that are not going too well.
p77
aVAnd I'd like to run through a few of these today.
p78
aa(lp79
VI'd like to kick off by looking at education.
p80
aVNow education is a field
p81
aVthe secular world really believes in.
p82
aVWhen we think about how we're going to make the world a better place,
p83
aVwe think education; that's where we put a lot of money.
p84
aVEducation is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills,
p85
aVit's also going to make us better people.
p86
aVYou know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies,
p87
aVthose lyrical claims
p88
aVthat education, the process of education \u2014 particularly higher education \u2014
p89
aVwill make us into nobler and better human beings.
p90
aVThat's a lovely idea.
p91
aVInteresting where it came from.
p92
aa(lp93
VIn the early 19th century,
p94
aVchurch attendance in Western Europe
p95
aVstarted sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.
p96
aVThey asked themselves the following question.
p97
aVThey said, where are people going to find the morality,
p98
aVwhere are they going to find guidance,
p99
aVand where are they going to find sources of consolation?
p100
aVAnd influential voices came up with one answer.
p101
aVThey said culture.
p102
aVIt's to culture that we should look
p103
aVfor guidance, for consolation, for morality.
p104
aVLet's look to the plays of Shakespeare,
p105
aVthe dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.
p106
aVIn there, we'll find a lot of the truths
p107
aVthat we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John.
p108
aVNow I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.
p109
aVThey wanted to replace scripture with culture.
p110
aVAnd that's a very plausible idea.
p111
aVIt's also an idea that we have forgotten.
p112
aa(lp113
VIf you went to a top university \u2014
p114
aVlet's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge \u2014
p115
aVand you said, "I've come here
p116
aVbecause I'm in search of morality, guidance and consolation;
p117
aVI want to know how to live,"
p118
aVthey would show you the way to the insane asylum.
p119
aVThis is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning
p120
aVare in the business of.
p121
aVWhy? They don't think we need it.
p122
aVThey don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.
p123
aVThey see us as adults, rational adults.
p124
aVWhat we need is information.
p125
aVWe need data, we don't need help.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow religions start from a very different place indeed.
p128
aVAll religions, all major religions,
p129
aVat various points call us children.
p130
aVAnd like children,
p131
aVthey believe that we are in severe need of assistance.
p132
aVWe're only just holding it together.
p133
aVPerhaps this is just me, maybe you.
p134
aVBut anyway, we're only just holding it together.
p135
aVAnd we need help. Of course, we need help.
p136
aVAnd so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.
p137
aa(lp138
VYou know, in the 18th century in the U.K.,
p139
aVthe greatest preacher, greatest religious preacher, was a man called John Wesley,
p140
aVwho went up and down this country delivering sermons,
p141
aVadvising people how they could live.
p142
aVHe delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children
p143
aVand children to their parents,
p144
aVthe duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.
p145
aVHe was trying to tell people how they should live
p146
aVthrough the medium of sermons,
p147
aVthe classic medium of delivery of religions.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow we've given up with the idea of sermons.
p150
aVIf you said to a modern liberal individualist,
p151
aV"Hey, how about a sermon?"
p152
aVthey'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those.
p153
aVI'm an independent, individual person."
p154
aVWhat's the difference between a sermon
p155
aVand our modern, secular mode of delivery, the lecture?
p156
aVWell a sermon wants to change your life
p157
aVand a lecture wants to give you a bit of information.
p158
aVAnd I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.
p159
aVThe tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable,
p160
aVbecause we are in need of guidance,
p161
aVmorality and consolation \u2014
p162
aVand religions know that.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnother point about education:
p165
aVwe tend to believe in the modern secular world
p166
aVthat if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it.
p167
aVSit them in a classroom, tell them about Plato
p168
aVat the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years,
p169
aVand that lesson will stick with them.
p170
aVReligions go, "Nonsense.
p171
aVYou need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day.
p172
aVSo get on your knees and repeat it."
p173
aVThat's what all religions tell us:
p174
aV"Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day."
p175
aVOtherwise our minds are like sieves.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo religions are cultures of repetition.
p178
aVThey circle the great truths again and again and again.
p179
aVWe associate repetition with boredom.
p180
aV"Give us the new," we're always saying.
p181
aV"The new is better than the old."
p182
aVIf I said to you, "Okay, we're not going to have new TED.
p183
aVWe're just going to run through all the old ones
p184
aVand watch them five times because they're so true.
p185
aVWe're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times
p186
aVbecause what she says is so clever," you'd feel cheated.
p187
aVNot so if you're adopting a religious mindset.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe other things that religions do
p190
aVis to arrange time.
p191
aVAll the major religions give us calendars.
p192
aVWhat is a calendar?
p193
aVA calendar is a way of making sure that across the year
p194
aVyou will bump into certain very important ideas.
p195
aVIn the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar,
p196
aVat the end of March you will think about St. Jerome
p197
aVand his qualities of humility and goodness
p198
aVand his generosity to the poor.
p199
aVYou won't do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.
p200
aVNow we don't think that way.
p201
aVIn the secular world we think, "If an idea is important, I'll bump into it.
p202
aVI'll just come across it."
p203
aVNonsense, says the religious world view.
p204
aVReligious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time,
p205
aVwe need to synchronize encounters.
p206
aVThis comes across also
p207
aVin the way in which religions set up rituals
p208
aVaround important feelings.
p209
aa(lp210
VTake the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon.
p211
aVYou know, when you look at the Moon,
p212
aVyou think, "I'm really small. What are my problems?"
p213
aVIt sets things into perspective, etc., etc.
p214
aVWe should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't.
p215
aVWhy don't we? Well there's nothing to tell us, "Look at the Moon."
p216
aVBut if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September,
p217
aVyou will be ordered out of your home, made to stand on a canonical platform
p218
aVand made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi,
p219
aVwhere you will be given poems to read
p220
aVin honor of the Moon and the passage of time
p221
aVand the frailty of life that it should remind us of.
p222
aVYou'll be handed rice cakes.
p223
aVAnd the Moon and the reflection on the Moon
p224
aVwill have a secure place in your heart.
p225
aVThat's very good.
p226
aa(lp227
VThe other thing that religions are really aware of
p228
aVis: speak well \u2014
p229
aVI'm not doing a very good job of this here \u2014
p230
aVbut oratory, oratory is absolutely key to religions.
p231
aVIn the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker
p232
aVand still have a great career.
p233
aVBut the religious world doesn't think that way.
p234
aVWhat you're saying needs to be backed up
p235
aVby a really convincing way of saying it.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church
p238
aVin the American South
p239
aVand you listen to how they talk,
p240
aVmy goodness, they talk well.
p241
aVAfter every convincing point, people will go, "Amen, amen, amen."
p242
aVAt the end of a really rousing paragraph, they'll all stand up,
p243
aVand they'll go, "Thank you Jesus, thank you Christ, thank you Savior."
p244
aVIf we were doing it like they do it \u2014
p245
aVlet's not do it, but if we were to do it \u2014
p246
aVI would tell you something like, "Culture should replace scripture."
p247
aVAnd you would go, "Amen, amen, amen."
p248
aVAnd at the end of my talk, you would all stand up
p249
aVand you would go, "Thank you Plato, thank you Shakespeare, thank you Jane Austen."
p250
aVAnd we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.
p251
aVAll right, all right. We're getting there. We're getting there.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VThe other thing that religions know is we're not just brains,
p256
aVwe are also bodies.
p257
aVAnd when they teach us a lesson,
p258
aVthey do it via the body.
p259
aVSo for example,
p260
aVtake the Jewish idea of forgiveness.
p261
aVJews are very interested in forgiveness
p262
aVand how we should start anew and start afresh.
p263
aVThey don't just deliver us sermons on this.
p264
aVThey don't just give us books or words about this.
p265
aVThey tell us to have a bath.
p266
aVSo in Orthodox Jewish communities, every Friday you go to a Mikveh.
p267
aVYou immerse yourself in the water,
p268
aVand a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.
p269
aVWe don't tend to do that.
p270
aVOur ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.
p271
aVReligions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two.
p272
aa(lp273
VLet's look at art now.
p274
aVNow art is something that in the secular world,
p275
aVwe think very highly of. We think art is really, really important.
p276
aVA lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.
p277
aVWe sometimes hear it said
p278
aVthat museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.
p279
aVYou've heard that saying.
p280
aVNow I think that the potential is there,
p281
aVbut we've completely let ourselves down.
p282
aVAnd the reason we've let ourselves down
p283
aVis that we're not properly studying
p284
aVhow religions handle art.
p285
aa(lp286
VThe two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world
p287
aVthat inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art:
p288
aVThe first idea is that art should be for art's sake \u2014
p289
aVa ridiculous idea \u2014
p290
aVan idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble
p291
aVand should not try to do anything with this troubled world.
p292
aVI couldn't disagree more.
p293
aVThe other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself,
p294
aVthat artists shouldn't say what they're up to,
p295
aVbecause if they said it, it might destroy the spell
p296
aVand we might find it too easy.
p297
aVThat's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum \u2014
p298
aVlet's admit it \u2014
p299
aVis, "I don't know what this is about."
p300
aVBut if we're serious people, we don't admit to that.
p301
aVBut that feeling of puzzlement is structural
p302
aVto contemporary art.
p303
aa(lp304
VNow religions have a much saner attitude to art.
p305
aVThey have no trouble telling us what art is about.
p306
aVArt is about two things in all the major faiths.
p307
aVFirstly, it's trying to remind you
p308
aVof what there is to love.
p309
aVAnd secondly, it's trying to remind you
p310
aVof what there is to fear and to hate.
p311
aVAnd that's what art is.
p312
aVArt is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.
p313
aVSo as you walk around a church,
p314
aVor a mosque or a cathedral,
p315
aVwhat you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is,
p316
aVthrough your eyes, through your senses,
p317
aVtruths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.
p318
aa(lp319
VEssentially it's propaganda.
p320
aVRembrandt is a propagandist
p321
aVin the Christian view.
p322
aVNow the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.
p323
aVWe think of Hitler, we think of Stalin. Don't, necessarily.
p324
aVPropaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.
p325
aVAnd if that thing is good, there's no problem with it at all.
p326
aa(lp327
VMy view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.
p328
aVAnd they should make sure that when you walk into a museum \u2014
p329
aVif I was a museum curator,
p330
aVI would make a room for love, a room for generosity.
p331
aVAll works of art are talking to us about things.
p332
aVAnd if we were able to arrange spaces
p333
aVwhere we could come across works
p334
aVwhere we would be told, use these works of art
p335
aVto cement these ideas in your mind,
p336
aVwe would get a lot more out of art.
p337
aVArt would pick up the duty that it used to have
p338
aVand that we've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas.
p339
aVArt should be one of the tools
p340
aVby which we improve our society.
p341
aVArt should be didactic.
p342
aa(lp343
VLet's think of something else.
p344
aVThe people in the modern world, in the secular world,
p345
aVwho are interested in matters of the spirit,
p346
aVin matters of the mind,
p347
aVin higher soul-like concerns,
p348
aVtend to be isolated individuals.
p349
aVThey're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers.
p350
aVAnd they tend to be on their own.
p351
aVThey're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable, single people.
p352
aVAnd they get depressed and they get sad on their own.
p353
aVAnd they don't really change much.
p354
aa(lp355
VNow think about religions, think about organized religions.
p356
aVWhat do organized religions do?
p357
aVThey group together, they form institutions.
p358
aVAnd that has all sorts of advantages.
p359
aVFirst of all, scale, might.
p360
aVThe Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year
p361
aVaccording to the Wall Street Journal.
p362
aVThese are massive machines.
p363
aVThey're collaborative, they're branded, they're multinational,
p364
aVand they're highly disciplined.
p365
aa(lp366
VThese are all very good qualities.
p367
aVWe recognize them in relation to corporations.
p368
aVAnd corporations are very like religions in many ways,
p369
aVexcept they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.
p370
aVThey're selling us shoes and cars.
p371
aVWhereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff \u2014
p372
aVthe therapists, the poets \u2014
p373
aVare on their own and they have no power,
p374
aVthey have no might.
p375
aVSo religions are the foremost example
p376
aVof an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind.
p377
aVNow we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us,
p378
aVbut we can admire the institutional way
p379
aVin which they're doing it.
p380
aa(lp381
VBooks alone, books written by lone individuals,
p382
aVare not going to change anything.
p383
aVWe need to group together.
p384
aVIf you want to change the world, you have to group together, you have to be collaborative.
p385
aVAnd that's what religions do.
p386
aVThey are multinational, as I say,
p387
aVthey are branded, they have a clear identity,
p388
aVso they don't get lost in a busy world.
p389
aVThat's something we can learn from.
p390
aa(lp391
VI want to conclude.
p392
aVReally what I want to say
p393
aVis for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields,
p394
aVthere is something to learn from the example of religion \u2014
p395
aVeven if you don't believe any of it.
p396
aVIf you're involved in anything that's communal,
p397
aVthat involves lots of people getting together,
p398
aVthere are things for you in religion.
p399
aVIf you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way,
p400
aVlook at pilgrimage.
p401
aVLook very closely at pilgrimage.
p402
aVWe haven't begun to scratch the surface
p403
aVof what travel could be
p404
aVbecause we haven't looked at what religions do with travel.
p405
aVIf you're in the art world,
p406
aVlook at the example of what religions are doing with art.
p407
aVAnd if you're an educator in any way,
p408
aVagain, look at how religions are spreading ideas.
p409
aVYou may not agree with the ideas,
p410
aVbut my goodness, they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so.
p411
aa(lp412
VSo really my concluding point
p413
aVis you may not agree with religion,
p414
aVbut at the end of the day,
p415
aVreligions are so subtle, so complicated,
p416
aVso intelligent in many ways
p417
aVthat they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone;
p418
aVthey're for all of us.
p419
aa(lp420
VThank you very much.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Applause)
p423
aa(lp424
VChris Anderson: Now this is actually a courageous talk,
p425
aVbecause you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways
p426
aVto be ridiculed in some quarters.
p427
aa(lp428
VAB: You can get shot by both sides.
p429
aVYou can get shot by the hard-headed atheists,
p430
aVand you can get shot by those who fully believe.
p431
aa(lp432
VCA: Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment.
p433
aa(lp434
VAB: Indeed.
p435
aa(lp436
VCA: But you left out one aspect of religion
p437
aVthat a lot of people might say
p438
aVyour agenda could borrow from,
p439
aVwhich is this sense \u2014
p440
aVthat's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious \u2014
p441
aVof spiritual experience,
p442
aVof some kind of connection
p443
aVwith something that's bigger than you are.
p444
aVIs there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0?
p445
aa(lp446
VAB: Absolutely. I, like many of you, meet people
p447
aVwho say things like, "But isn't there something bigger than us,
p448
aVsomething else?"
p449
aVAnd I say, "Of course." And they say, "So aren't you sort of religious?"
p450
aVAnd I go, "No." Why does that sense of mystery,
p451
aVthat sense of the dizzying scale of the universe,
p452
aVneed to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?
p453
aVScience and just observation
p454
aVgives us that feeling without it,
p455
aVso I don't feel the need.
p456
aVThe universe is large and we are tiny,
p457
aVwithout the need for further religious superstructure.
p458
aVSo one can have so-called spiritual moments
p459
aVwithout belief in the spirit.
p460
aa(lp461
VCA: Actually, let me just ask a question.
p462
aVHow many people here would say
p463
aVthat religion is important to them?
p464
aVIs there an equivalent process
p465
aVby which there's a sort of bridge
p466
aVbetween what you're talking about and what you would say to them?
p467
aa(lp468
VAB: I would say that there are many, many gaps in secular life
p469
aVand these can be plugged.
p470
aVIt's not as though, as I try to suggest,
p471
aVit's not as though either you have religion
p472
aVand then you have to accept all sorts of things,
p473
aVor you don't have religion
p474
aVand then you're cut off from all these very good things.
p475
aVIt's so sad that we constantly say,
p476
aV"I don't believe so I can't have community,
p477
aVso I'm cut off from morality,
p478
aVso I can't go on a pilgrimage."
p479
aVOne wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?"
p480
aVAnd that's really the spirit of my talk.
p481
aVThere's so much we can absorb.
p482
aVAtheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion.
p483
aa(lp484
VCA: It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community
p485
aVwho are atheists.
p486
aVBut probably most people in the community
p487
aVcertainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon
p488
aVand want to find the language
p489
aVto have a constructive dialogue
p490
aVand to feel like we can actually talk to each other
p491
aVand at least share some things in common.
p492
aVAre we foolish to be optimistic
p493
aVabout the possibility of a world
p494
aVwhere, instead of religion being the great rallying cry
p495
aVof divide and war,
p496
aVthat there could be bridging?
p497
aa(lp498
VAB: No, we need to be polite about differences.
p499
aVPoliteness is a much-overlooked virtue.
p500
aVIt's seen as hypocrisy.
p501
aVBut we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist
p502
aVand someone says, "Well you know, I did pray the other day,"
p503
aVyou politely ignore it.
p504
aVYou move on.
p505
aVBecause you've agreed on 90 percent of things,
p506
aVbecause you have a shared view on so many things,
p507
aVand you politely differ.
p508
aVAnd I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.
p509
aVThey've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement.
p510
aa(lp511
VCA: And finally, does this new thing that you're proposing
p512
aVthat's not a religion but something else,
p513
aVdoes it need a leader,
p514
aVand are you volunteering to be the pope?
p515
aa(lp516
V(Laughter)
p517
aa(lp518
VAB: Well, one thing that we're all very suspicious of
p519
aVis individual leaders.
p520
aVIt doesn't need it.
p521
aVWhat I've tried to lay out is a framework
p522
aVand I'm hoping that people can just fill it in.
p523
aVI've sketched a sort of broad framework.
p524
aVBut wherever you are, as I say, if you're in the travel industry, do that travel bit.
p525
aVIf you're in the communal industry, look at religion and do the communal bit.
p526
aVSo it's a wiki project.
p527
aa(lp528
V(Laughter)
p529
aa(lp530
VCA: Alain, thank you for sparking many conversations later.

VSomething called the Danish Twin Study
p5
aVestablished that only about 10 percent
p6
aVof how long the average person lives,
p7
aVwithin certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.
p8
aVThe other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.
p9
aVSo the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the
p10
aVoptimal lifestyle of longevity
p11
aVwe can come up with a de facto formula
p12
aVfor longevity.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut if you ask the average American what the optimal formula
p15
aVof longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.
p16
aVThey've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.
p17
aVYou have the USDA food pyramid.
p18
aVThere is what Oprah tells us.
p19
aVThere is what Doctor Oz tells us.
p20
aa(lp21
VThe fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion
p22
aVaround what really helps us live longer better.
p23
aVShould you be running marathons or doing yoga?
p24
aVShould you eat organic meats
p25
aVor should you be eating tofu?
p26
aVWhen it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?
p27
aVHow about these hormones or resveratrol?
p28
aVAnd does purpose play into it?
p29
aVSpirituality? And how about how we socialize?
p30
aa(lp31
VWell, our approach to finding longevity
p32
aVwas to team up with National Geographic,
p33
aVand the National Institute on Aging,
p34
aVto find the four demographically confirmed areas
p35
aVthat are geographically defined.
p36
aVAnd then bring a team of experts in there
p37
aVto methodically go through exactly what these people do,
p38
aVto distill down the cross-cultural distillation.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.
p41
aVBut first I'd like to debunk some common myths
p42
aVwhen it comes to longevity.
p43
aVAnd the first myth is if you try really hard
p44
aVyou can live to be 100.
p45
aVFalse.
p46
aVThe problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people
p47
aVin America live to be 100.
p48
aVYour chances are very low.
p49
aVEven though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,
p50
aVit's hard to reach 100.
p51
aVThe problem is
p52
aVthat we're not programmed for longevity.
p53
aVWe are programmed for something called
p54
aVprocreative success.
p55
aVI love that word.
p56
aVIt reminds me of my college days.
p57
aa(lp58
VBiologists term procreative success to mean
p59
aVthe age where you have children
p60
aVand then another generation, the age when your children have children.
p61
aVAfter that the effect of evolution
p62
aVcompletely dissipates.
p63
aVIf you're a mammal, if you're a rat
p64
aVor an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.
p65
aVSo to make it to age 100, you not only have to have
p66
aVhad a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won
p67
aVthe genetic lottery.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe second myth is,
p70
aVthere are treatments that can help slow,
p71
aVreverse, or even stop aging.
p72
aVFalse.
p73
aVWhen you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.
p74
aVDeprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,
p75
aVthose brain cells die, they never come back.
p76
aVPlay tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage,
p77
aVthe cartilage never comes back.
p78
aVOur arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,
p79
aVand we can get Alzheimer's.
p80
aVThere is just too many things to go wrong.
p81
aa(lp82
VOur bodies have 35 trillion cells,
p83
aVtrillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVThose cells turn themselves over once every eight years.
p86
aVAnd every time they turn themselves over
p87
aVthere is some damage. And that damage builds up.
p88
aVAnd it builds up exponentially.
p89
aVIt's a little bit like the days when we all had
p90
aVBeatles albums or Eagles albums
p91
aVand we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,
p92
aVand let our friends copy that cassette tape,
p93
aVand pretty soon, with successive generations
p94
aVthat tape sounds like garbage.
p95
aVWell, the same things happen to our cells.
p96
aVThat's why a 65-year-old person
p97
aVis aging at a rate of about
p98
aV125 times faster
p99
aVthan a 12-year-old person.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo, if there is nothing you can do
p102
aVto slow your aging or stop your aging,
p103
aVwhat am I doing here?
p104
aVWell, the fact of the matter is
p105
aVthe best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,
p106
aVmy body, your body,
p107
aVis about 90 years,
p108
aVa little bit more for women.
p109
aVBut life expectancy in this country
p110
aVis only 78.
p111
aVSo somewhere along the line,
p112
aVwe're leaving about 12 good years on the table.
p113
aVThese are years that we could get.
p114
aVAnd research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,
p115
aVheart disease, cancer and diabetes.
p116
aa(lp117
VWe think the best way to get these missing years
p118
aVis to look at the cultures around the world
p119
aVthat are actually experiencing them,
p120
aVareas where people are living to age 100
p121
aVat rates up to 10 times greater than we are,
p122
aVareas where the life expectancy
p123
aVis an extra dozen years,
p124
aVthe rate of middle age mortality is a fraction
p125
aVof what it is in this country.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles
p128
aVoff the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.
p129
aVAnd not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,
p130
aVbut only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.
p131
aVAnd here we have this area where men live the longest,
p132
aVabout 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.
p133
aVAnd this is a place where people not only reach age 100,
p134
aVthey do so with extraordinary vigor.
p135
aVPlaces where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,
p136
aVchop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VTheir history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.
p140
aVIt's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.
p141
aVBecause the land is so infertile,
p142
aVthey largely are shepherds,
p143
aVwhich occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.
p144
aVTheir diet is mostly plant-based,
p145
aVaccentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.
p146
aVThey came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread
p147
aVcalled carta musica made out of durum wheat,
p148
aVa type of cheese made from grass-fed animals
p149
aVso the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids
p150
aVinstead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals,
p151
aVand a type of wine that has three times the level
p152
aVof polyphenols than any known wine in the world.
p153
aVIt's called Cannonau.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut the real secret I think lies more
p156
aVin the way that they organize their society.
p157
aVAnd one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society
p158
aVis how they treat older people.
p159
aVYou ever notice here in America, social equity
p160
aVseems to peak at about age 24?
p161
aVJust look at the advertisements.
p162
aVHere in Sardinia, the older you get
p163
aVthe more equity you have,
p164
aVthe more wisdom you're celebrated for.
p165
aVYou go into the bars in Sardinia,
p166
aVinstead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar,
p167
aVyou see the centenarian of the month calendar.
p168
aa(lp169
VThis, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents
p170
aVto keep them close to the family \u2014
p171
aVit imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy \u2014
p172
aVresearch shows it's also good for the children of those families,
p173
aVwho have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.
p174
aVThat's called the grandmother effect.
p175
aa(lp176
VWe found our second Blue Zone
p177
aVon the other side of the planet,
p178
aVabout 800 miles south of Tokyo,
p179
aVon the archipelago of Okinawa.
p180
aVOkinawa is actually 161 small islands.
p181
aVAnd in the northern part of the main island,
p182
aVthis is ground zero for world longevity.
p183
aVThis is a place where the oldest living female population is found.
p184
aVIt's a place where people have the longest disability-free
p185
aVlife expectancy in the world.
p186
aVThey have what we want.
p187
aVThey live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,
p188
aVvery quickly,
p189
aVand often, I can tell you, after sex.
p190
aa(lp191
VThey live about seven good years longer than the average American.
p192
aVFive times as many centenarians as we have in America.
p193
aVOne fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,
p194
aVbig killers here in America.
p195
aVAnd one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.
p196
aVAnd the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers
p197
aVsuggests strongly they have something to teach us.
p198
aVWhat do they do?
p199
aVOnce again, a plant-based diet,
p200
aVfull of vegetables with lots of color in them.
p201
aVAnd they eat about eight times as much tofu
p202
aVas Americans do.
p203
aa(lp204
VMore significant than what they eat is how they eat it.
p205
aVThey have all kinds of little strategies
p206
aVto keep from overeating,
p207
aVwhich, as you know, is a big problem here in America.
p208
aVA few of the strategies we observed:
p209
aVthey eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.
p210
aVInstead of serving family style,
p211
aVwhere you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,
p212
aVthey serve at the counter, put the food away,
p213
aVand then bring it to the table.
p214
aa(lp215
VThey also have a 3,000-year-old adage,
p216
aVwhich I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.
p217
aVIt was invented by Confucius.
p218
aVAnd that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.
p219
aVIt's simply a little saying these people say before their meal
p220
aVto remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.
p221
aVIt takes about a half hour for that full feeling
p222
aVto travel from your belly to your brain.
p223
aVAnd by remembering to stop at 80 percent
p224
aVit helps keep you from doing that very thing.
p225
aa(lp226
VBut, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs
p227
aVthat we can associate with longevity.
p228
aVWe know that isolation kills.
p229
aVFifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.
p230
aVWe're down to one and half right now.
p231
aVIf you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,
p232
aVyou were born into a system where you
p233
aVautomatically have a half a dozen friends
p234
aVwith whom you travel through life.
p235
aVThey call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai
p236
aVyou're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,
p237
aVand if things go bad,
p238
aVchild gets sick, parent dies,
p239
aVyou always have somebody who has your back.
p240
aVThis particular Moai, these five ladies
p241
aVhave been together for 97 years.
p242
aVTheir average age is 102.
p243
aa(lp244
VTypically in America
p245
aVwe've divided our adult life up into two sections.
p246
aVThere is our work life,
p247
aVwhere we're productive.
p248
aVAnd then one day, boom, we retire.
p249
aVAnd typically that has meant
p250
aVretiring to the easy chair,
p251
aVor going down to Arizona to play golf.
p252
aVIn the Okinawan language there is not even
p253
aVa word for retirement.
p254
aVInstead there is one word
p255
aVthat imbues your entire life,
p256
aVand that word is "ikigai."
p257
aVAnd, roughly translated, it means
p258
aV"the reason for which you wake up in the morning."
p259
aa(lp260
VFor this 102-year-old karate master,
p261
aVhis ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.
p262
aVFor this hundred-year-old fisherman
p263
aVit was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.
p264
aVAnd this is a question. The National Institute on Aging
p265
aVactually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.
p266
aVAnd one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,
p267
aVthe people who put the questionnaire.
p268
aVOne of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?"
p269
aVThey instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.
p270
aVFor this 102 year old woman, her ikigai
p271
aVwas simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.
p272
aVTwo girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.
p273
aVAnd I asked her what it felt like
p274
aVto hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.
p275
aVAnd she put her head back and she said,
p276
aV"It feels like leaping into heaven."
p277
aVI thought that was a wonderful thought.
p278
aa(lp279
VMy editor at Geographic
p280
aVwanted me to find America's Blue Zone.
p281
aVAnd for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,
p282
aVwhere actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.
p283
aVBut that's because all the young people left.
p284
aV(Laughter)
p285
aVSo, we turned to the data again.
p286
aVAnd we found America's longest-lived population
p287
aVamong the Seventh-Day Adventists
p288
aVconcentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.
p289
aVAdventists are conservative Methodists.
p290
aVThey celebrate their Sabbath
p291
aVfrom sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.
p292
aVA "24-hour sanctuary in time," they call it.
p293
aVAnd they follow five little habits
p294
aVthat conveys to them extraordinary longevity,
p295
aVcomparatively speaking.
p296
aa(lp297
VIn America here, life expectancy
p298
aVfor the average woman is 80.
p299
aVBut for an Adventist woman,
p300
aVtheir life expectancy is 89.
p301
aVAnd the difference is even more pronounced among men,
p302
aVwho are expected to live about 11 years
p303
aVlonger than their American counterparts.
p304
aVNow, this is a study that followed
p305
aVabout 70,000 people for 30 years.
p306
aVSterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates
p307
aVthe premise of this Blue Zone project.
p308
aa(lp309
VThis is a heterogeneous community.
p310
aVIt's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.
p311
aVThe only thing that they have in common are a set of
p312
aVvery small lifestyle habits
p313
aVthat they follow ritualistically
p314
aVfor most of their lives.
p315
aVThey take their diet directly from the Bible.
p316
aVGenesis: Chapter one, Verse [29],
p317
aVwhere God talks about legumes and seeds,
p318
aVand on one more stanza about green plants,
p319
aVostensibly missing is meat.
p320
aVThey take this sanctuary in time very serious.
p321
aa(lp322
VFor 24 hours every week,
p323
aVno matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,
p324
aVwhere the kids need to be driven,
p325
aVthey stop everything and they focus on their God,
p326
aVtheir social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,
p327
aVare nature walks.
p328
aVAnd the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,
p329
aVthe power is it's done every week for a lifetime.
p330
aVNone of it's hard. None of it costs money.
p331
aVAdventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.
p332
aVSo, if you go to an Adventist's party
p333
aVyou don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.
p334
aVInstead they're talking about their next nature walk,
p335
aVexchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.
p336
aVBut they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.
p337
aa(lp338
VThis is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.
p339
aVEllsworth Whareham is 97 years old.
p340
aVHe's a multimillionaire,
p341
aVyet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars
p342
aVto build a privacy fence,
p343
aVhe said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself."
p344
aVSo for the next three days he was out shoveling cement,
p345
aVand hauling poles around.
p346
aVAnd predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day
p347
aVhe ended up in the operating room.
p348
aVBut not as the guy on the table;
p349
aVthe guy doing open-heart surgery.
p350
aVAt 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.
p351
aa(lp352
VEd Rawlings, 103 years old now,
p353
aVan active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.
p354
aVAnd on weekends he likes to put on the boards,
p355
aVthrow up rooster tails.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd then Marge Deton.
p358
aVMarge is 104.
p359
aVHer grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.
p360
aVShe starts her day with lifting weights.
p361
aVShe rides her bicycle.
p362
aVAnd then she gets in her root-beer colored
p363
aV1994 Cadillac Seville,
p364
aVand tears down the San Bernardino freeway,
p365
aVwhere she still volunteers for seven different organizations.
p366
aVI've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.
p367
aVI'm probably the only person you'll ever meet
p368
aVwho rode his bicycle across
p369
aVthe Sahara desert without sunscreen.
p370
aVBut I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing
p371
aVthan riding shotgun with Marge Deton.
p372
aV"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!" she'd say to me.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo, what are the common denominators
p375
aVin these three cultures?
p376
aVWhat are the things that they all do?
p377
aVAnd we managed to boil it down to nine.
p378
aVIn fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this
p379
aVand these common denominators hold true.
p380
aVAnd the first one,
p381
aVand I'm about to utter a heresy here,
p382
aVnone of them exercise,
p383
aVat least the way we think of exercise.
p384
aVInstead, they set up their lives
p385
aVso that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.
p386
aVThese 100-year-old Okinawan women
p387
aVare getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor,
p388
aV30 or 40 times a day.
p389
aa(lp390
VSardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs.
p391
aVEvery trip to the store, or to church
p392
aVor to a friend's house occasions a walk.
p393
aVThey don't have any conveniences.
p394
aVThere is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.
p395
aVIf they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.
p396
aVThat's physical activity.
p397
aVThat burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.
p398
aVWhen they do do intentional physical activity,
p399
aVit's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk,
p400
aVthe only proven way to stave off cognitive decline,
p401
aVand they all tend to have a garden.
p402
aVThey know how to set up their life in the right way
p403
aVso they have the right outlook.
p404
aa(lp405
VEach of these cultures take time to downshift.
p406
aVThe Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.
p407
aVThe Okinawans have this ancestor veneration.
p408
aVBut when you're in a hurry or stressed out,
p409
aVthat triggers something called the inflammatory response,
p410
aVwhich is associated with everything from Alzheimer's
p411
aVdisease to cardiovascular disease.
p412
aVWhen you slow down for 15 minutes a day
p413
aVyou turn that inflammatory state
p414
aVinto a more anti-inflammatory state.
p415
aa(lp416
VThey have vocabulary for sense of purpose,
p417
aVikigai, like the Okinawans.
p418
aVYou know the two most dangerous years in your life
p419
aVare the year you're born, because of infant mortality,
p420
aVand the year you retire.
p421
aVThese people know their sense of purpose,
p422
aVand they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years
p423
aVof extra life expectancy.
p424
aa(lp425
VThere's no longevity diet.
p426
aVInstead, these people drink a little bit every day,
p427
aVnot a hard sell to the American population.
p428
aV(Laughter)
p429
aVThey tend to eat a plant-based diet.
p430
aVDoesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts.
p431
aVAnd they have strategies to keep from overeating,
p432
aVlittle things that nudge them away from the table at the right time.
p433
aa(lp434
VAnd then the foundation of all this is how they connect.
p435
aVThey put their families first,
p436
aVtake care of their children and their aging parents.
p437
aVThey all tend to belong to a faith-based community,
p438
aVwhich is worth between four and 14
p439
aVextra years of life expectancy
p440
aVif you do it four times a month.
p441
aVAnd the biggest thing here
p442
aVis they also belong to the right tribe.
p443
aVThey were either born into
p444
aVor they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.
p445
aa(lp446
VWe know from the Framingham studies,
p447
aVthat if your three best friends are obese
p448
aVthere is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight.
p449
aVSo, if you hang out with unhealthy people,
p450
aVthat's going to have a measurable impact over time.
p451
aVInstead, if your friend's idea of recreation

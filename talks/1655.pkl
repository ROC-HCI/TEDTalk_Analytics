VLet me tell you a story.
p5
aa(lp6
VIt's my first year as a new high school science teacher,
p7
aVand I'm so eager.
p8
aVI'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans.
p9
aVBut I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization
p10
aVthat my students just might not be learning anything.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis happens one day:
p13
aVI'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter
p14
aVabout my favorite subject in all of biology:
p15
aVviruses and how they attack.
p16
aVAnd so I'm so excited to discuss this with them,
p17
aVand I come in and I say, "Can somebody please explain
p18
aVthe main ideas and why this is so cool?"
p19
aa(lp20
VThere's silence.
p21
aVFinally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye,
p22
aVand she says, "The reading sucked."
p23
aVAnd then she clarified. She said, "You know what,
p24
aVI don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it.
p25
aVIt's boring. Um, who cares, and it sucks."
p26
aa(lp27
VThese sympathetic smiles
p28
aVspread all throughout the room now,
p29
aVand I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat,
p30
aVthat maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook,
p31
aVbut not one of them really understood the main ideas.
p32
aVNot one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool,
p33
aVwhy it's so important.
p34
aa(lp35
VI'm totally clueless.
p36
aVI have no idea what to do next.
p37
aVSo the only thing I can think of is say,
p38
aV"Listen. Let me tell you a story.
p39
aVThe main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses.
p40
aVThese guys are blown up a couple million times.
p41
aVThe real bacteria and viruses are so small
p42
aVwe can't see them without a microscope,
p43
aVand you guys might know bacteria and viruses
p44
aVbecause they both make us sick.
p45
aVBut what a lot of people don't know is that viruses
p46
aVcan also make bacteria sick."
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, the story that I start telling my kids,
p49
aVit starts out like a horror story.
p50
aVOnce upon a time there's this happy little bacterium.
p51
aVDon't get too attached to him.
p52
aVMaybe he's floating around in your stomach
p53
aVor in some spoiled food somewhere,
p54
aVand all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good.
p55
aVMaybe he ate something bad for lunch,
p56
aVand then things get really horrible,
p57
aVas his skin rips apart, and he sees a virus
p58
aVcoming out from his insides.
p59
aVAnd then it gets horrible
p60
aVwhen he bursts open and an army of viruses
p61
aVfloods out from his insides.
p62
aVIf \u2014 Ouch is right! \u2014
p63
aVIf you see this, and you're a bacterium,
p64
aVthis is like your worst nightmare.
p65
aVBut if you're a virus and you see this,
p66
aVyou cross those little legs of yours and you think,
p67
aV"We rock."
p68
aVBecause it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium.
p69
aVHere's what had to happen.
p70
aVA virus grabbed onto a bacterium
p71
aVand it slipped its DNA into it.
p72
aVThe next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff
p73
aVthat chopped up the bacteria DNA.
p74
aVAnd now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA,
p75
aVthe virus DNA takes control of the cell
p76
aVand it tells it to start making more viruses.
p77
aVBecause, you see, DNA is like a blueprint
p78
aVthat tells living things what to make.
p79
aVSo this is kind of like going into a car factory
p80
aVand replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots.
p81
aVThe workers still come the next day, they do their job,
p82
aVbut they're following different instructions.
p83
aVSo replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA
p84
aVturns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses \u2014
p85
aVthat is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts.
p86
aVBut that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria.
p87
aVSome are much more crafty.
p88
aVWhen a secret agent virus infects a bacterium,
p89
aVthey do a little espionage.
p90
aVHere, this cloaked, secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell,
p91
aVbut here's the kicker: It doesn't do anything harmful \u2014 not at first.
p92
aVInstead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA,
p93
aVand it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell,
p94
aVwaiting for instructions.
p95
aVAnd what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies,
p96
aVthe babies also have the virus DNA in them.
p97
aVSo now we have a whole extended bacteria family,
p98
aVfilled with virus sleeper cells.
p99
aVThey're just happily living together until a signal happens
p100
aVand \u2014 BAM! \u2014 all of the DNA pops out.
p101
aVIt takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories,
p102
aVand they all burst,
p103
aVa huge, extended bacteria family,
p104
aVall dying with viruses spilling out of their guts,
p105
aVthe viruses taking over the bacterium.
p106
aVSo now you understand how viruses can attack cells.
p107
aVThere are two ways: On the left is what we call the lytic way,
p108
aVwhere the viruses go right in and take over the cells.
p109
aVOn the [right] is the lysogenic way
p110
aVthat uses secret agent viruses.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo this stuff is not that hard, right?
p113
aVAnd now all of you understand it.
p114
aVBut if you've graduated from high school,
p115
aVI can almost guarantee you've seen this information before.
p116
aVBut I bet it was presented in a way
p117
aVthat it didn't exactly stick in your mind.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo when my students were first learning this,
p120
aVwhy did they hate it so much?
p121
aVWell, there were a couple of reasons.
p122
aa(lp123
VFirst of all, I can guarantee you that their textbooks
p124
aVdidn't have secret agent viruses, and they didn't have horror stories.
p125
aVYou know, in the communication of science
p126
aVthere is this obsession with seriousness.
p127
aVIt kills me. I'm not kidding.
p128
aVI used to work for an educational publisher,
p129
aVand as a writer, I was always told never to use stories
p130
aVor fun, engaging language,
p131
aVbecause then my work might not be viewed
p132
aVas "serious" and "scientific."
p133
aVRight? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun
p134
aVwhen they're learning science.
p135
aVSo we have this field of science that's all about slime,
p136
aVand color changes. Check this out.
p137
aVAnd then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have,
p138
aVexplosions!
p139
aVBut if a textbook seems too much fun,
p140
aVit's somehow unscientific.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow another problem was that
p143
aVthe language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible.
p144
aVIf we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier,
p145
aVwe could start by saying something like,
p146
aV"These viruses make copies of themselves
p147
aVby slipping their DNA into a bacterium."
p148
aVThe way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this:
p149
aV"Bacteriophage replication is initiated
p150
aVthrough the introduction of viral nucleic acid
p151
aVinto a bacterium."
p152
aVThat's great, perfect for 13-year-olds.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut here's the thing. There are plenty of people
p155
aVin science education who would look at this and say there's no way
p156
aVthat we could ever give that to students,
p157
aVbecause it contains some language that isn't completely accurate.
p158
aVFor example, I told you that viruses have DNA.
p159
aVWell, a very tiny fraction of them don't.
p160
aVThey have something called RNA instead.
p161
aVSo a professional science writer would circle that
p162
aVand say, "That has to go.
p163
aVWe have to change it to something much more technical."
p164
aVAnd after a team of professional science editors
p165
aVwent over this really simple explanation,
p166
aVthey'd find fault with almost every word I've used,
p167
aVand they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough,
p168
aVand they'd have to change everything
p169
aVthat wasn't 100 percent perfect.
p170
aVThen it would be accurate,
p171
aVbut it would be completely impossible to understand.
p172
aVThis is horrifying.
p173
aa(lp174
VYou know, I keep talking about this idea
p175
aVof telling a story,
p176
aVand it's like science communication has taken on this idea
p177
aVof what I call the tyranny of precision,
p178
aVwhere you can't just tell a story.
p179
aVIt's like science has become that horrible storyteller
p180
aVthat we all know, who gives us all the details nobody cares about,
p181
aVwhere you're like, "Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day,
p182
aVand she was wearing these ugly jeans.
p183
aVI mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings,
p184
aVbut, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings,
p185
aVlike, but I think \u2014 " and you're just like, "Oh my God.
p186
aVWhat is the point?"
p187
aVOr even worse, science education is becoming
p188
aVlike that guy who always says, "Actually."
p189
aVRight? You want to be like, "Oh, dude,
p190
aVwe had to get up in the middle of the night
p191
aVand drive a hundred miles in total darkness."
p192
aVAnd that guy's like, "Actually, it was 87.3 miles."
p193
aVAnd you're like, "Actually, shut up!
p194
aVI'm just trying to tell a story."
p195
aa(lp196
VBecause good storytelling is all about emotional connection.
p197
aVWe have to convince our audience
p198
aVthat what we're talking about matters.
p199
aVBut just as important is knowing
p200
aVwhich details we should leave out
p201
aVso that the main point still comes across.
p202
aVI'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said,
p203
aVand I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes
p204
aVyou have to lie in order to tell the truth.
p205
aVI think this sentiment is particularly relevant
p206
aVto science education.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow, finally,
p209
aVI am often so disappointed
p210
aVwhen people think that I'm advocating
p211
aVa dumbing down of science.
p212
aVThat's not true at all.
p213
aVI'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT,
p214
aVand I absolutely understand the importance of detailed,
p215
aVspecific scientific communication between experts,
p216
aVbut not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds.
p217
aVIf a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA,
p218
aVthat's not going to ruin their chances of success in science.
p219
aVBut if a young learner can't understand anything in science
p220
aVand learns to hate it because it all sounds like this,
p221
aVthat will ruin their chances of success.
p222
aa(lp223
VThis needs to stop,
p224
aVand I wish that the change could come from the institutions
p225
aVat the top that are perpetuating these problems,
p226
aVand I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it.
p227
aVBut I think that's unlikely.
p228
aVSo we are so lucky that we have resources
p229
aVlike the Internet, where we can circumvent these institutions
p230
aVfrom the bottom up.
p231
aVThere's a growing number of online resources
p232
aVthat are dedicated to just explaining science
p233
aVin simple, understandable ways.
p234
aVI dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain
p235
aVany scientific concept you can think of
p236
aVin simple language any middle schooler can understand.
p237
aVAnd I myself spend most of my free time
p238
aVmaking these science videos that I put on YouTube.
p239
aVI explain chemical equilibrium using analogies
p240
aVto awkward middle school dances,
p241
aVand I talk about fuel cells with stories
p242
aVabout boys and girls at a summer camp.
p243
aVThe feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled
p244
aVand it's often written in LOLcats,
p245
aVbut nonetheless
p246
aVit's so appreciative, so thankful
p247
aVthat I know this is the right way
p248
aVwe should be communicating science.
p249
aa(lp250
VThere's still so much work left to be done, though,
p251
aVand if you're involved with science in any way
p252
aVI urge you to join me.
p253
aVPick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever,
p254
aVbut leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon.
p255
aVMake me laugh. Make me care.
p256
aVLeave out those annoying details that nobody cares about
p257
aVand just get to the point.
p258
aVHow should you start?
p259
aVWhy don't you say, "Listen, let me tell you a story"?
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you.
p262

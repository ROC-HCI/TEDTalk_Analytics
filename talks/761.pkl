VI'm a cancer doctor, and I walked out of my office
p5
aVand walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago,
p6
aVand this was the cover of Fortune magazine
p7
aVsitting in the window of the pharmacy.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd so, as a cancer doctor, you look at this,
p10
aVand you get a little bit downhearted.
p11
aVBut when you start to read the article by Cliff,
p12
aVwho himself is a cancer survivor,
p13
aVwho was saved by a clinical trial
p14
aVwhere his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York
p15
aVto get an experimental therapy for \u2014
p16
aVat the time \u2014 Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life,
p17
aVhe makes remarkable points here.
p18
aVAnd the point of the article was that we have gotten
p19
aVreductionist in our view of biology,
p20
aVin our view of cancer.
p21
aVFor the last 50 years, we have focused on treating
p22
aVthe individual gene
p23
aVin understanding cancer, not in controlling cancer.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, this is an astounding table.
p26
aVAnd this is something that sobers us in our field everyday
p27
aVin that, obviously, we've made remarkable impacts
p28
aVon cardiovascular disease,
p29
aVbut look at cancer. The death rate in cancer
p30
aVin over 50 years hasn't changed.
p31
aVWe've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia,
p32
aVwhere we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission,
p33
aVbut in general, we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, what I'm going to tell you today,
p36
aVis a little bit of why I think that's the case,
p37
aVand then go out of my comfort zone
p38
aVand tell you where I think it's going,
p39
aVwhere a new approach \u2014 that we hope to push forward
p40
aVin terms of treating cancer.
p41
aVBecause this is wrong.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo, what is cancer, first of all?
p44
aVWell, if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value, you go to a doctor,
p45
aVthey stick a needle in.
p46
aVThey way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition:
p47
aVDoes it look normal? Does it look abnormal?
p48
aa(lp49
VSo, that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle.
p50
aVThis is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell.
p51
aVThat is the state-of-the-art today in diagnosing cancer.
p52
aVThere's no molecular test,
p53
aVthere's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday,
p54
aVthere's no fancy looking at the chromosomes.
p55
aVThis is the state-of-the-art and how we do it.
p56
aa(lp57
VYou know, I know very well, as a cancer doctor, I can't treat advanced cancer.
p58
aVSo, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early.
p59
aVIt is the only way you can start to fight cancer, is by catching it early.
p60
aVWe can prevent most cancers.
p61
aVYou know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease.
p62
aVWe could do the same in cancer.
p63
aVI co-founded a company called Navigenics,
p64
aVwhere, if you spit into a tube \u2014
p65
aVand we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease,
p66
aVall of which are delayable in many of the cancers \u2014
p67
aVyou start to identify what you could get,
p68
aVand then we can start to work to prevent them.
p69
aVBecause the problem is, when you have advanced cancer,
p70
aVwe can't do that much today about it, as the statistics allude to.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo, the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged.
p73
aVWhy is it a disease of the aged?
p74
aVBecause evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children.
p75
aVSee, evolution protected us during our childbearing years
p76
aVand then, after age 35 or 40 or 45,
p77
aVit said "It doesn't matter anymore, because they've had their progeny."
p78
aVSo if you look at cancers, it is very rare \u2014 extremely rare \u2014
p79
aVto have cancer in a child, on the order of thousands of cases a year.
p80
aVAs one gets older? Very, very common.
p81
aa(lp82
VWhy is it hard to treat?
p83
aVBecause it's heterogeneous,
p84
aVand that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.
p85
aVIt starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells,
p86
aVwhat we call clonal selection.
p87
aVBut, if we start to understand
p88
aVthat cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more,
p89
aVthen we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo, one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer
p92
aVis that, right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives, symptoms:
p93
aV"I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, etc."
p94
aVYou then have some anatomic descriptions,
p95
aVyou get that CT scan: "There's a three centimeter mass in the liver."
p96
aVYou then have some body part descriptions:
p97
aV"It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate."
p98
aVAnd that's about it.
p99
aVSo, our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor.
p100
aVIt's basically symptoms.
p101
aVIt's manifestations of a disease.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhat's exciting is that over the last two or three years,
p104
aVthe government has spent 400 million dollars,
p105
aVand they've allocated another billion dollars,
p106
aVto what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project.
p107
aVSo, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer,
p108
aVand giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it.
p109
aVYou know, in the mid-1850's in France,
p110
aVthey started to describe cancer by body part.
p111
aVThat hasn't changed in over 150 years.
p112
aVIt is absolutely archaic that we call cancer
p113
aVby prostate, by breast, by muscle.
p114
aVIt makes no sense, if you think about it.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, obviously, the technology is here today,
p117
aVand, over the next several years, that will change.
p118
aVYou will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic.
p119
aVYou will go to a HER2 amplified clinic, or an EGFR activated clinic,
p120
aVand they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions
p121
aVthat were involved in causing this individual cancer.
p122
aVSo, hopefully, we will go from being the art of medicine
p123
aVmore to the science of medicine,
p124
aVand be able to do what they do in infectious disease,
p125
aVwhich is look at that organism, that bacteria,
p126
aVand then say, "This antibiotic makes sense,
p127
aVbecause you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it."
p128
aVWhen one is exposed to H1N1, you take Tamiflu,
p129
aVand you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms
p130
aVand prevent many of the manifestations of the disease.
p131
aVWhy? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it \u2014
p132
aValthough we can't make vaccine in this country, but that's a different story.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now.
p135
aVThe first cancer was done, which was brain cancer.
p136
aVIn the next month, the end of December, you'll see ovarian cancer,
p137
aVand then lung cancer will come several months after.
p138
aVThere's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes,
p139
aVwhich I think is going to be the next level
p140
aVin terms of understanding and classifying disease.
p141
aVBut remember, I'm not pushing genomics,
p142
aVproteomics, to be a reductionist.
p143
aVI'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against.
p144
aVAnd there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to.
p145
aa(lp146
VIn health care today, we spend most of the dollars \u2014
p147
aVin terms of treating disease \u2014
p148
aVmost of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life.
p149
aVWe spend very little, if any, dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against.
p150
aVIf you could start to move that, to identify what you're up against,
p151
aVyou're going to do things a hell of a lot better.
p152
aVIf we could even take it one step further and prevent disease,
p153
aVwe can take it enormously the other direction,
p154
aVand obviously, that's where we need to go, going forward.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo, this is the website of the National Cancer Institute.
p157
aVAnd I'm here to tell you, it's wrong.
p158
aVSo, the website of the National Cancer Institute
p159
aVsays that cancer is a genetic disease.
p160
aVThe website says, "If you look, there's an individual mutation,
p161
aVand maybe a second, and maybe a third,
p162
aVand that is cancer."
p163
aVBut, as a cancer doc, this is what I see.
p164
aVThis isn't a genetic disease.
p165
aVSo, there you see, it's a liver with colon cancer in it,
p166
aVand you see into the microscope a lymph node
p167
aVwhere cancer has invaded.
p168
aVYou see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver.
p169
aVCancer is an interaction of a cell
p170
aVthat no longer is under growth control with the environment.
p171
aVIt's not in the abstract; it's the interaction with the environment.
p172
aVIt's what we call a system.
p173
aa(lp174
VThe goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer.
p175
aVAnd I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades,
p176
aVis that we have strived to understand cancer.
p177
aVThe goal is to control cancer.
p178
aVAnd that is a very different optimization scheme,
p179
aVa very different strategy for all of us.
p180
aa(lp181
VI got up at the American Association of Cancer Research,
p182
aVone of the big cancer research meetings, with 20,000 people there,
p183
aVand I said, "We've made a mistake.
p184
aVWe've all made a mistake, myself included,
p185
aVby focusing down, by being a reductionist.
p186
aVWe need to take a step back."
p187
aVAnd, believe it or not, there were hisses in the audience.
p188
aVPeople got upset, but this is the only way we're going to go forward.
p189
aa(lp190
VYou know, I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago.
p191
aVWe were pushed together, and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other.
p192
aVI said, "Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney, who designed computers?"
p193
aVAnd he was saying: Does he really want to meet another doctor?
p194
aVBut people prevailed on us, and we got together,
p195
aVand it's been transformative in what I do, absolutely transformative.
p196
aVWe have designed, and we have worked on the modeling \u2014
p197
aVand much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team \u2014
p198
aVthe modeling of cancer in the body as complex system.
p199
aVAnd I'll show you some data there
p200
aVwhere I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it.
p201
aa(lp202
VThe key is, when you look at these variables and you look at this data,
p203
aVyou have to understand the data inputs.
p204
aVYou know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days,
p205
aVand I asked, "What was the average temperature?"
p206
aVand it came back at 98.7, I would say, "Great."
p207
aVBut if during one of those days
p208
aVyour temperature spiked to 102 for six hours,
p209
aVand you took Tylenol and got better, etc.,
p210
aVI would totally miss it.
p211
aVSo, one of the problems, the fundamental problems in medicine
p212
aVis that you and I, and all of us,
p213
aVwe go to our doctor once a year.
p214
aVWe have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them.
p215
aa(lp216
VEarlier it was referred to this direct life device.
p217
aVYou know, I've been using it for two and a half months.
p218
aVIt's a staggering device, not because it tells me
p219
aVhow many kilocalories I do every day,
p220
aVbut because it looks, over 24 hours, what I've done in a day.
p221
aVAnd I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk,
p222
aVand I'm not moving at all.
p223
aVAnd a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here
p224
aVare really different than we understand them,
p225
aVbecause we're not measuring them dynamically.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd so, if you think of cancer as a system,
p228
aVthere's an input and an output and a state in the middle.
p229
aVSo, the states, are equivalent classes of history,
p230
aVand the cancer patient, the input, is the environment,
p231
aVthe diet, the treatment, the genetic mutations.
p232
aVThe output are our symptoms:
p233
aVDo we have pain? Is the cancer growing? Do we feel bloated, etc.?
p234
aVMost of that state is hidden.
p235
aVSo what we do in our field is we change and input,
p236
aVwe give aggressive chemotherapy,
p237
aVand we say, "Did that output get better? Did that pain improve, etc.?"
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd so, the problem is that it's not just one system,
p240
aVit's multiple systems on multiple scales.
p241
aVIt's a system of systems.
p242
aVAnd so, when you start to look at emergent systems,
p243
aVyou can look at a neuron under a microscope.
p244
aVA neuron under the microscope is very elegant
p245
aVwith little things sticking out and little things over here,
p246
aVbut when you start to put them together in a complex system,
p247
aVand you start to see that it becomes a brain,
p248
aVand that brain can create intelligence,
p249
aVwhat we're talking about in the body,
p250
aVand cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.
p251
aVWell, the bad news is that these robust \u2014
p252
aVand robust is a key word \u2014
p253
aVemergent systems are very hard to understand in detail.
p254
aVThe good news is you can manipulate them.
p255
aVYou can try to control them
p256
aVwithout that fundamental understanding of every component.
p257
aa(lp258
VOne of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer
p259
aVcame out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine,
p260
aVwhere they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer.
p261
aVSo, about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get.
p262
aVThey had gotten their chemotherapy,
p263
aVand then they randomized them,
p264
aVwhere half got placebo,
p265
aVand half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone.
p266
aVIt's used to treat osteoporosis,
p267
aVand they got that twice a year.
p268
aVThey looked and, in these 1,800 women,
p269
aVgiven twice a year a drug that builds bone,
p270
aVyou reduce the recurrence of cancer by 35 percent.
p271
aVReduce occurrence of cancer by a drug
p272
aVthat doesn't even touch the cancer.
p273
aVSo the notion, you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow as well.
p274
aVYou change that system,
p275
aVand you could have a marked effect on the cancer.
p276
aa(lp277
VNobody has ever shown \u2014 and this will be shocking \u2014
p278
aVnobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy
p279
aVactually touches a cancer cell.
p280
aVIt's never been shown.
p281
aVThere's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes,
p282
aVthat if you give this cancer drug, you can do this effect to the cell,
p283
aVbut the doses in those dishes are nowhere near
p284
aVthe doses that happen in the body.
p285
aa(lp286
VIf I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol
p287
aVevery three weeks, which is the standard,
p288
aVabout 40 percent of women with metastatic cancer
p289
aVhave a great response to that drug.
p290
aVAnd a response is 50 percent shrinkage.
p291
aVWell, remember that's not even an order of magnitude,
p292
aVbut that's a different story.
p293
aVThey then recur, I give them that same drug every week.
p294
aVAnother 30 percent will respond.
p295
aVThey then recur, I give them that same drug
p296
aVover 96 hours by continuous infusion,
p297
aVanother 20 or 30 percent will respond.
p298
aVSo, you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size.
p299
aVIt's not. We have no idea the mechanism.
p300
aVSo the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting
p301
aVthat complex system,
p302
aVjust like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence,
p303
aVchemotherapy may work by that same exact way.
p304
aVThe wild thing about that trial also,
p305
aVwas that it reduced new primaries, so new cancers, by 30 percent also.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo, the problem is, yours and mine, all of our systems are changing.
p308
aVThey're dynamic.
p309
aVI mean, this is a scary slide, not to take an aside,
p310
aVbut it looks at obesity in the world.
p311
aVAnd I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers, they're kind of small.
p312
aVBut, if you start to look at it, that red, that dark color there,
p313
aVmore than 75 percent of the population
p314
aVof those countries are obese.
p315
aVLook a decade ago, look two decades ago: markedly different.
p316
aVSo, our systems today are dramatically different
p317
aVthan our systems a decade or two ago.
p318
aVSo the diseases we have today,
p319
aVwhich reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades,
p320
aVare going to change dramatically over the next decade or so
p321
aVbased on things like this.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo, this picture, although it is beautiful, is a 40-gigabyte picture
p324
aVof the whole proteome.
p325
aVSo this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet,
p326
aVand we're able to get resolution
p327
aVwhere we can start to see all of the proteins in the body.
p328
aVWe can start to see that system.
p329
aVEach of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified.
p330
aVThe power of these magnets, the power of what we can do here,
p331
aVis that we can see an individual neutron with this technology.
p332
aVSo, again, this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis
p333
aVand a group called Applied Proteomics,
p334
aVwhere we can start to see individual neutron differences,
p335
aVand we can start to look at that system like we never have before.
p336
aVSo, instead of a reductionist view, we're taking a step back.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo this is a woman, 46 years old,
p339
aVwho had recurrent lung cancer.
p340
aVIt was in her brain, in her lungs, in her liver.
p341
aVShe had gotten Carboplatin Taxol, Carboplatin Taxotere,
p342
aVGemcitabine, Navelbine:
p343
aVEvery drug we have she had gotten, and that disease continued to grow.
p344
aVShe had three kids under the age of 12,
p345
aVand this is her CT scan.
p346
aVAnd so what this is, is we're taking a cross-section of her body here,
p347
aVand you can see in the middle there is her heart,
p348
aVand to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor
p349
aVthat will invade and will kill her, untreated, in a matter of weeks.
p350
aVShe goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway,
p351
aVand again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer,
p352
aVbut it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone.
p353
aVSix months later it's still gone.
p354
aVThat cancer recurred, and she passed away three years later from lung cancer,
p355
aVbut she got three years from a drug
p356
aVwhose symptoms predominately were acne.
p357
aVThat's about it.
p358
aa(lp359
VSo, the problem is that the clinical trial was done,
p360
aVand we were a part of it,
p361
aVand in the fundamental clinical trial \u2014
p362
aVthe pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three,
p363
aVwe refused to use a placebo.
p364
aVWould you want your mother, your brother, your sister
p365
aVto get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live?
p366
aVAnd the answer, obviously, is not.
p367
aVSo, it was done on this group of patients.
p368
aVTen percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here,
p369
aVand the drug went to the FDA,
p370
aVand the FDA said, "Without a placebo,
p371
aVhow do I know patients actually benefited from the drug?"
p372
aVSo the morning the FDA was going to meet,
p373
aVthis was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal.
p374
aV(Laughter)
p375
aVAnd so, what do you know, that drug was approved.
p376
aa(lp377
VThe amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial,
p378
aVwhere they gave half placebo and half the drug.
p379
aVAnd we learned something important there.
p380
aVWhat's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada,
p381
aVwhere it's "more ethical to give placebos."
p382
aVThey had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval,
p383
aVso I think there were three U.S. patients
p384
aVin upstate New York who were part of the trial.
p385
aVBut they did that, and what they found
p386
aVis that 70 percent of the non-responders
p387
aVlived much longer and did better than people who got placebo.
p388
aVSo it challenged everything we knew in cancer,
p389
aVis that you don't need to get a response.
p390
aVYou don't need to shrink the disease.
p391
aVIf we slow the disease, we may have more of a benefit
p392
aVon patient survival, patient outcome, how they feel,
p393
aVthan if we shrink the disease.
p394
aa(lp395
VThe problem is that, if I'm this doc, and I get your CT scan today
p396
aVand you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver,
p397
aVand you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters,
p398
aVdid that drug help you or not?
p399
aVHow do I know?
p400
aVWould it have been 10 centimeters, or am I giving you a drug
p401
aVwith no benefit and significant cost?
p402
aVSo, it's a fundamental problem.
p403
aVAnd, again, that's where these new technologies can come in.
p404
aa(lp405
VAnd so, the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office \u2014
p406
aVwell, the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease, right?
p407
aVThe ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening.
p408
aVThat is the most effective, cost-effective,
p409
aVbest way we can do things today.
p410
aVBut if one is unfortunate to get a disease,
p411
aVyou'll go into your doctor's office, he or she will take a drop of blood,
p412
aVand we will start to know how to treat your disease.
p413
aVThe way we've approached it is the field of proteomics,
p414
aVagain, this looking at the system.
p415
aVIt's taking a big picture.
p416
aa(lp417
VThe problem with technologies like this is
p418
aVthat if one looks at proteins in the body,
p419
aVthere are 11 orders of magnitude difference
p420
aVbetween the high-abundant and the low-abundant proteins.
p421
aVSo, there's no technology in the world that can span 11 orders of magnitude.
p422
aVAnd so, a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others
p423
aVis to try to bring in engineering principles, try to bring the software.
p424
aVWe can start to look at different components along this spectrum.
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd so, earlier was talked about cross-discipline, about collaboration.
p427
aVAnd I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now
p428
aVis that people from those fields are coming in.
p429
aVYesterday, the National Cancer Institute announced a new program
p430
aVcalled the Physical Sciences and Oncology,
p431
aVwhere physicists, mathematicians, are brought in to think about cancer,
p432
aVpeople who never approached it before.
p433
aVDanny and I got 16 million dollars, they announced yesterday,
p434
aVto try to attach this problem.
p435
aVA whole new approach, instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy
p436
aVby different mechanisms,
p437
aVto try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body.
p438
aa(lp439
VSo, just for two seconds, how these technologies work \u2014
p440
aVbecause I think it's important to understand it.
p441
aVWhat happens is every protein in your body is charged,
p442
aVso the proteins are sprayed in, the magnet spins them around,
p443
aVand then there's a detector at the end.
p444
aVWhen it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge.
p445
aVAnd so we can accurately \u2014 if the magnet is big enough,
p446
aVand your resolution is high enough \u2014
p447
aVyou can actually detect all of the proteins in the body
p448
aVand start to get an understanding of the individual system.
p449
aa(lp450
VAnd so, as a cancer doctor,
p451
aVinstead of having paper in my chart, in your chart, and it being this thick,
p452
aVthis is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices,
p453
aVwhere that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data.
p454
aVElectronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease.
p455
aVAnd certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter
p456
aVand actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter,
p457
aVwithout fundamental learning.
p458
aa(lp459
VSo, to conclude, we need to get away from reductionist thinking.
p460
aVWe need to start to think differently and radically.
p461
aVAnd so, I implore everyone here: Think differently. Come up with new ideas.
p462
aVTell them to me or anyone else in our field,
p463
aVbecause over the last 59 years, nothing has changed.
p464
aVWe need a radically different approach.
p465
aa(lp466
VYou know, Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel \u2014
p467
aVand Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual.
p468
aVWhen Andy stepped down, he said,
p469
aV"No technology will win. Technology itself will win."
p470
aVAnd I'm a firm believer, in the field of medicine and especially cancer,
p471
aVthat it's going to be a broad platform of technologies
p472
aVthat will help us move forward
p473
aVand hopefully help patients in the near-term.
p474
aa(lp475
VThank you very much.

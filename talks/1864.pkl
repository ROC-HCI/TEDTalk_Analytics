VI would like to talk to you about a story
p5
aVabout a small town kid.
p6
aVI don't know his name, but I do know his story.
p7
aVHe lives in a small village in southern Somalia.
p8
aVHis village is near Mogadishu.
p9
aVDrought drives the small village into poverty
p10
aVand to the brink of starvation.
p11
aVWith nothing left for him there,
p12
aVhe leaves for the big city,
p13
aVin this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.
p14
aVWhen he arrives, there are no opportunities,
p15
aVno jobs, no way forward.
p16
aVHe ends up living in a tent city
p17
aVon the outskirts of Mogadishu.
p18
aVMaybe a year passes, nothing.
p19
aVOne day, he's approached by a gentleman
p20
aVwho offers to take him to lunch,
p21
aVthen to dinner, to breakfast.
p22
aVHe meets this dynamic group of people,
p23
aVand they give him a break.
p24
aVHe's given a bit of money
p25
aVto buy himself some new clothes,
p26
aVmoney to send back home to his family.
p27
aVHe is introduced to this young woman.
p28
aVHe eventually gets married.
p29
aVHe starts this new life.
p30
aVHe has a purpose in life.
p31
aa(lp32
VOne beautiful day in Mogadishu,
p33
aVunder an azure blue sky,
p34
aVa car bomb goes off.
p35
aVThat small town kid with the big city dreams
p36
aVwas the suicide bomber,
p37
aVand that dynamic group of people
p38
aVwere al Shabaab, a terrorist organization
p39
aVlinked to al Qaeda.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo how does the story of a small town kid
p42
aVjust trying to make it big in the city
p43
aVend up with him blowing himself up?
p44
aVHe was waiting.
p45
aVHe was waiting for an opportunity,
p46
aVwaiting to begin his future,
p47
aVwaiting for a way forward,
p48
aVand this was the first thing that came along.
p49
aVThis was the first thing that pulled him out
p50
aVof what we call waithood.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd his story repeats itself
p53
aVin urban centers around the world.
p54
aVIt is the story of the disenfranchised,
p55
aVunemployed urban youth
p56
aVwho sparks riots in Johannesburg,
p57
aVsparks riots in London,
p58
aVwho reaches out for something other than waithood.
p59
aVFor young people, the promise of the city,
p60
aVthe big city dream is that of opportunity,
p61
aVof jobs, of wealth,
p62
aVbut young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities.
p63
aVOften it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates.
p64
aVBy 2030, three out of five people living in cities
p65
aVwill be under the age of 18.
p66
aVIf we do not include young people
p67
aVin the growth of our cities,
p68
aVif we do not provide them opportunities,
p69
aVthe story of waithood,
p70
aVthe gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,
p71
aVwill be the story of cities 2.0.
p72
aVAnd in my city of birth, Mogadishu,
p73
aV70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment.
p74
aV70 percent don't work,
p75
aVdon't go to school.
p76
aVThey pretty much do nothing.
p77
aa(lp78
VI went back to Mogadishu last month,
p79
aVand I went to visit Madina Hospital,
p80
aVthe hospital I was born in.
p81
aVI remember standing in front of that
p82
aVbullet-ridden hospital thinking,
p83
aVwhat if I had never left?
p84
aVWhat if I had been forced
p85
aVinto that same state of waithood?
p86
aVWould I have become a terrorist?
p87
aVI'm not really sure about the answer.
p88
aa(lp89
VMy reason for being in Mogadishu that month
p90
aVwas actually to host
p91
aVa youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.
p92
aVI brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.
p93
aVWe sat down and brainstormed on solutions
p94
aVto the biggest challenges facing their city.
p95
aa(lp96
VOne of the young men in the room was Aden.
p97
aVHe went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.
p98
aVThere were no jobs, no opportunities.
p99
aVI remember him telling me,
p100
aVbecause he was a college graduate,
p101
aVunemployed, frustrated,
p102
aVthat he was the perfect target for al Shabaab
p103
aVand other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.
p104
aVThey sought people like him out.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut his story takes a different route.
p107
aVIn Mogadishu, the biggest barrier
p108
aVto getting from point A to point B are the roads.
p109
aVTwenty-three years of civil war
p110
aVhave completely destroyed the road system,
p111
aVand a motorbike can be the easiest way
p112
aVto get around.
p113
aVAden saw an opportunity and seized it.
p114
aVHe started a motorbike company.
p115
aVHe began renting out motorbikes
p116
aVto local residents who couldn't normally afford them.
p117
aVHe bought 10 bikes, with the help
p118
aVof family and friends,
p119
aVand his dream is to eventually expand
p120
aVto several hundred within the next three years.
p121
aa(lp122
VHow is this story different?
p123
aVWhat makes his story different?
p124
aVI believe it is his ability to identify
p125
aVand seize a new opportunity.
p126
aVIt's entrepreneurship,
p127
aVand I believe entrepreneurship can be
p128
aVthe most powerful tool against waithood.
p129
aVIt empowers young people
p130
aVto be the creators of the very economic opportunities
p131
aVthey are so desperately seeking.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
p134
aVI want to talk to you about a young man
p135
aVwho attended one of my meetings,
p136
aVMohamed Mohamoud, a florist.
p137
aVHe was helping me train some of the young people
p138
aVat the summit in entrepreneurship
p139
aVand how to be innovative
p140
aVand how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.
p141
aVHe's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen
p142
aVin over 22 years,
p143
aVand until recently, until Mohamed came along,
p144
aVif you wanted flowers at your wedding,
p145
aVyou used plastic bouquets
p146
aVshipped from abroad.
p147
aVIf you asked someone,
p148
aV"When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?"
p149
aVfor many who grew up under civil war,
p150
aVthe answer would be, "Never."
p151
aa(lp152
VSo Mohamed saw an opportunity.
p153
aVHe started a landscaping and design floral company.
p154
aVHe created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,
p155
aVand started growing tulips and lilies,
p156
aVwhich he said could survive
p157
aVthe harsh Mogadishu climate.
p158
aVAnd he began delivering flowers to weddings,
p159
aVcreating gardens at homes
p160
aVand businesses around the city,
p161
aVand he's now working on creating
p162
aVMogadishu's first public park in 22 years.
p163
aVThere's no public park in Mogadishu.
p164
aVHe wants to create a space where families,
p165
aVyoung people, can come together,
p166
aVand, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.
p167
aVAnd he doesn't grow roses because
p168
aVthey use too much water, by the way.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo the first step is to inspire young people,
p171
aVand in that room, Mohamed's presence
p172
aVhad a really profound impact on the youth in that room.
p173
aVThey had never really thought about starting up a business.
p174
aVThey've thought about working for an NGO,
p175
aVworking for the government,
p176
aVbut his story, his innovation,
p177
aVreally had a strong impact on them.
p178
aVHe forced them to look at their city
p179
aVas a place of opportunity.
p180
aVHe empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs,
p181
aVthat they could be change makers.
p182
aVBy the end of the day, they were coming up
p183
aVwith innovative solutions
p184
aVto some of the biggest challenges facing their city.
p185
aVThey came up with entrepreneurial solutions
p186
aVto local problems.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo inspiring young people
p189
aVand creating a culture of entrepreneurship
p190
aVis a really great step,
p191
aVbut young people need capital
p192
aVto make their ideas a reality.
p193
aVThey need expertise and mentorship
p194
aVto guide them in developing and launching their businesses.
p195
aVConnect young people with the resources they need,
p196
aVprovide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation,
p197
aVand you will create catalysts for urban growth.
p198
aa(lp199
VFor me, entrepreneurship is more than just
p200
aVstarting up a business.
p201
aVIt's about creating a social impact.
p202
aVMohamed is not simply selling flowers.
p203
aVI believe he is selling hope.
p204
aVHis Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,
p205
aVwhen it's created, will actually transform
p206
aVthe way people see their city.
p207
aVAden hired street kids to help rent out
p208
aVand maintain those bikes for him.
p209
aVHe gave them the opportunity to escape
p210
aVthe paralysis of waithood.
p211
aVThese young entrepreneurs are having
p212
aVa tremendous impact in their cities.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo my suggestion is,
p215
aVturn youth into entrepreneurs,
p216
aVincubate and nurture their inherent innovation,
p217
aVand you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks
p218
aVthan of car bombs and waithood.
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you.

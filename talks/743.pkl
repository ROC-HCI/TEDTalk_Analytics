VRight now is the most exciting time
p5
aVto see new Indian art.
p6
aVContemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world
p7
aVlike never before.
p8
aVI thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time
p9
aVcollectors here with us at TED, local collectors,
p10
aVto have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists
p11
aVI wish everyone at TED to know.
p12
aa(lp13
VThe first is Bharti Kher.
p14
aVThe central motif of Bharti's practice
p15
aVis the ready-made store-bought bindi
p16
aVthat untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads,
p17
aVevery day, in an act closely associated with
p18
aVthe institution of marriage.
p19
aVBut originally the significance of the bindi
p20
aVis to symbolize the third eye
p21
aVbetween the spiritual world and the religious world.
p22
aVBharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it,
p23
aVby exploding it into something spectacular.
p24
aVShe also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals,
p25
aVwhich she then completely covers in bindis,
p26
aVoften with potent symbolism.
p27
aVShe says she first got started with
p28
aV10 packets of bindis,
p29
aVand then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand.
p30
aa(lp31
VOur next artist, Balasubramaniam,
p32
aVreally stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation,
p33
aVworking wonders with fiberglass.
p34
aVSince Bala himself will be speaking at TED
p35
aVI won't spend too much time on him here today,
p36
aVexcept to say that he really succeeds
p37
aVat making the invisible visible.
p38
aa(lp39
VBrooklyn-based Chitra Ganesh
p40
aVis known for her digital collages,
p41
aVusing Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas
p42
aVas her primary source material.
p43
aVThese comics are a fundamental way
p44
aVthat children, especially in the diaspora,
p45
aVlearn their religious and mythological folk tales.
p46
aVI, for one, was steeped in these.
p47
aVChitra basically remixes and re-titles
p48
aVthese iconic images
p49
aVto tease out some of the sexual and gender politics
p50
aVembedded in these deeply influential comics.
p51
aVAnd she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well.
p52
aa(lp53
VJitish Kallat successfully practices across photography,
p54
aVsculpture, painting and installation.
p55
aVAs you can see, he's heavily influenced
p56
aVby graffiti and street art,
p57
aVand his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work.
p58
aVHe really captures that sense of density
p59
aVand energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay.
p60
aVHe also creates phantasmagoric sculptures
p61
aVmade of bones from cast resin.
p62
aVHere he envisions the carcass
p63
aVof an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot.
p64
aa(lp65
VThis next artist, N.S. Harsha,
p66
aVactually has a studio right here in Mysore.
p67
aVHe's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition.
p68
aVHe creates these fine, delicate images
p69
aVwhich he then repeats on a massive scale.
p70
aVHe uses scale to more and more spectacular effect,
p71
aVwhether on the roof of a temple in Singapore,
p72
aVor in his increasingly ambitious installation work,
p73
aVhere with 192 functioning sewing machines,
p74
aVfabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations.
p75
aa(lp76
VMumbai-based Dhruvi Acharya
p77
aVbuilds on her love of comic books and street art
p78
aVto comment on the roles and expectations
p79
aVof modern Indian women.
p80
aVShe too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas,
p81
aVbut in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh.
p82
aVIn this particular work, she actually strips out the images
p83
aVand leaves the actual text
p84
aVto reveal something previously unseen, and provocative.
p85
aa(lp86
VRaqib Shaw is Kolkata-born,
p87
aVKashmir-raised,
p88
aVand London-trained.
p89
aVHe too is reinventing the miniature tradition.
p90
aVHe creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch,
p91
aVbut also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth.
p92
aVHe actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work
p93
aVusing porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect.
p94
aa(lp95
VI'm kind of cheating with this next artist
p96
aVsince Raqs Media Collective are really
p97
aVthree artists working together.
p98
aVRaqs are probably the foremost practitioners
p99
aVof multimedia art in India today,
p100
aVworking across photography, video and installation.
p101
aVThey frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization,
p102
aVand their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work.
p103
aVHere, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime
p104
aVlooking at evidence and clues embedded
p105
aVin five narratives on these five different screens,
p106
aVin which the city itself may have been the culprit.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis next artist is probably the alpha male
p109
aVof contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta.
p110
aVHe was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases,
p111
aVpaintings of everyday objects,
p112
aVthe stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers
p113
aVknown to every Indian.
p114
aVHe celebrates these local and mundane objects globally,
p115
aVand on a grander and grander scale,
p116
aVby incorporating them into ever more colossal
p117
aVsculptures and installations.
p118
aVAnd finally number 10, last and certainly not least,
p119
aa(lp120
VRanjani Shettar,
p121
aVwho lives and works here in the state of Karnataka,
p122
aVcreates ethereal sculptures and installations
p123
aVthat really marry the organic to the industrial,
p124
aVand brings, like Subodh, the local global.
p125
aVThese are actually wires wrapped in muslin
p126
aVand steeped in vegetable dye.
p127
aVAnd she arranges them so that the viewer
p128
aVactually has to navigate through the space,
p129
aVand interact with the objects.
p130
aVAnd light and shadow are a very important part of her work.
p131
aVShe also explores themes of consumerism,
p132
aVand the environment, such as in this work,
p133
aVwhere these basket-like objects look organic and woven,
p134
aVand are woven,
p135
aVbut with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars
p136
aVthat she found in a Bangalore junkyard.
p137
aa(lp138
V10 artists, six minutes, I know that was a lot to take in.
p139
aVBut I can only hope I've whet your appetite
p140
aVto go out and see and learn more
p141
aVabout the amazing things that are happening in art in India today.
p142
aVThank you very much for looking and listening.

VTo give me an idea of how many of you here
p5
aVmay find what I'm about to tell you
p6
aVof practical value,
p7
aVlet me ask you please to raise your hands:
p8
aVWho here is either over 65 years old
p9
aVor hopes to live past age 65
p10
aVor has parents or grandparents who did live
p11
aVor have lived past 65,
p12
aVraise your hands please. (Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VOkay. You are the people to whom my talk
p15
aVwill be of practical value. (Laughter)
p16
aVThe rest of you
p17
aVwon't find my talk personally relevant,
p18
aVbut I think that you will still find the subject
p19
aVfascinating.
p20
aa(lp21
VI'm going to talk about growing older
p22
aVin traditional societies.
p23
aVThis subject constitutes just one chapter
p24
aVof my latest book, which compares
p25
aVtraditional, small, tribal societies
p26
aVwith our large, modern societies,
p27
aVwith respect to many topics
p28
aVsuch as bringing up children,
p29
aVgrowing older, health, dealing with danger,
p30
aVsettling disputes, religion
p31
aVand speaking more than one language.
p32
aa(lp33
VThose tribal societies, which constituted
p34
aVall human societies for most of human history,
p35
aVare far more diverse than are our modern,
p36
aVrecent, big societies.
p37
aVAll big societies that have governments,
p38
aVand where most people are strangers to each other,
p39
aVare inevitably similar to each other
p40
aVand different from tribal societies.
p41
aVTribes constitute thousands of natural experiments
p42
aVin how to run a human society.
p43
aVThey constitute experiments from which we ourselves
p44
aVmay be able to learn.
p45
aVTribal societies shouldn't be scorned
p46
aVas primitive and miserable,
p47
aVbut also they shouldn't be romanticized
p48
aVas happy and peaceful.
p49
aVWhen we learn of tribal practices,
p50
aVsome of them will horrify us,
p51
aVbut there are other tribal practices which,
p52
aVwhen we hear about them,
p53
aVwe may admire and envy
p54
aVand wonder whether we could adopt those practices
p55
aVourselves.
p56
aa(lp57
VMost old people in the U.S. end up living
p58
aVseparately from their children
p59
aVand from most of their friends
p60
aVof their earlier years,
p61
aVand often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly,
p62
aVwhereas in traditional societies,
p63
aVolder people instead live out their lives
p64
aVamong their children, their other relatives,
p65
aVand their lifelong friends.
p66
aVNevertheless, the treatment of the elderly
p67
aVvaries enormously among traditional societies,
p68
aVfrom much worse to much better
p69
aVthan in our modern societies.
p70
aa(lp71
VAt the worst extreme, many traditional societies
p72
aVget rid of their elderly
p73
aVin one of four increasingly direct ways:
p74
aVby neglecting their elderly
p75
aVand not feeding or cleaning them until they die,
p76
aVor by abandoning them when the group moves,
p77
aVor by encouraging older people to commit suicide,
p78
aVor by killing older people.
p79
aVIn which tribal societies do children
p80
aVabandon or kill their parents?
p81
aVIt happens mainly under two conditions.
p82
aVOne is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies
p83
aVthat often shift camp
p84
aVand that are physically incapable
p85
aVof transporting old people who can't walk
p86
aVwhen the able-bodied younger people already
p87
aVhave to carry their young children
p88
aVand all their physical possessions.
p89
aVThe other condition is in societies
p90
aVliving in marginal or fluctuating environments,
p91
aVsuch as the Arctic or deserts,
p92
aVwhere there are periodic food shortages,
p93
aVand occasionally there just isn't enough food
p94
aVto keep everyone alive.
p95
aVWhatever food is available has to be reserved
p96
aVfor able-bodied adults and for children.
p97
aVTo us Americans, it sounds horrible
p98
aVto think of abandoning or killing
p99
aVyour own sick wife or husband
p100
aVor elderly mother or father,
p101
aVbut what could those traditional societies
p102
aVdo differently?
p103
aVThey face a cruel situation of no choice.
p104
aVTheir old people had to do it to their own parents,
p105
aVand the old people know
p106
aVwhat now is going to happen to them.
p107
aa(lp108
VAt the opposite extreme
p109
aVin treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme,
p110
aVare the New Guinea farming societies
p111
aVwhere I've been doing my fieldwork  for the past 50 years,
p112
aVand most other sedentary traditional societies
p113
aVaround the world.
p114
aVIn those societies, older people are cared for.
p115
aVThey are fed. They remain valuable.
p116
aVAnd they continue to live in the same hut
p117
aVor else in a nearby hut near their children,
p118
aVrelatives and lifelong friends.
p119
aa(lp120
VThere are two main sets of reasons for this variation
p121
aVamong societies in their treatment
p122
aVof old people.
p123
aVThe variation depends especially
p124
aVon the usefulness of old people
p125
aVand on the society's values.
p126
aa(lp127
VFirst, as regards usefulness,
p128
aVolder people continue to perform useful services.
p129
aVOne use of older people in traditional societies
p130
aVis that they often are still effective
p131
aVat producing food.
p132
aVAnother traditional usefulness of older people
p133
aVis that they are capable of babysitting
p134
aVtheir grandchildren,
p135
aVthereby freeing up their own adult children,
p136
aVthe parents of those grandchildren,
p137
aVto go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren.
p138
aVStill another traditional value of older people
p139
aVis in making tools, weapons, baskets,
p140
aVpots and textiles.
p141
aVIn fact, they're usually the people who are best at it.
p142
aVOlder people usually are the leaders
p143
aVof traditional societies,
p144
aVand the people most knowledgeable about politics,
p145
aVmedicine, religion, songs and dances.
p146
aa(lp147
VFinally, older people in traditional societies
p148
aVhave a huge significance that would never occur
p149
aVto us in our modern, literate societies,
p150
aVwhere our sources of information are books
p151
aVand the Internet.
p152
aVIn contrast, in traditional societies without writing,
p153
aVolder people are the repositories of information.
p154
aVIt's their knowledge that spells the difference
p155
aVbetween survival and death for their whole society
p156
aVin a time of crisis caused by rare events
p157
aVfor which only the oldest people alive
p158
aVhave had experience.
p159
aVThose, then, are the ways in which older people
p160
aVare useful in traditional societies.
p161
aVTheir usefulness varies and contributes
p162
aVto variation in the society's treatment
p163
aVof the elderly.
p164
aa(lp165
VThe other set of reasons for variation
p166
aVin the treatment of the elderly is
p167
aVthe society's cultural values.
p168
aVFor example, there's particular emphasis
p169
aVon respect for the elderly in East Asia,
p170
aVassociated with Confucius' doctrine
p171
aVof filial piety, which means obedience,
p172
aVrespect and support for elderly parents.
p173
aVCultural values that emphasize respect for older people
p174
aVcontrast with the low status of the elderly
p175
aVin the U.S.
p176
aVOlder Americans are at a big disadvantage
p177
aVin job applications.
p178
aVThey're at a big disadvantage in hospitals.
p179
aVOur hospitals have an explicit policy
p180
aVcalled age-based allocation of healthcare resources.
p181
aVThat sinister expression means that
p182
aVif hospital resources are limited,
p183
aVfor example if only one donor heart
p184
aVbecomes available for transplant,
p185
aVor if a surgeon has time to operate
p186
aVon only a certain number of patients,
p187
aVAmerican hospitals have an explicit policy
p188
aVof giving preference to younger patients
p189
aVover older patients
p190
aVon the grounds that younger patients are considered
p191
aVmore valuable to society
p192
aVbecause they have more years of life ahead of them,
p193
aVeven though the younger patients have fewer years
p194
aVof valuable life experience behind them.
p195
aVThere are several reasons for this low status
p196
aVof the elderly in the U.S.
p197
aVOne is our Protestant work ethic
p198
aVwhich places high value on work,
p199
aVso older people who are no longer working
p200
aVaren't respected.
p201
aVAnother reason is our American emphasis
p202
aVon the virtues of self-reliance and independence,
p203
aVso we instinctively look down on older people
p204
aVwho are no longer self-reliant and independent.
p205
aVStill a third reason is our American cult of youth,
p206
aVwhich shows up even in our advertisements.
p207
aVAds for Coca-Cola and beer always depict
p208
aVsmiling young people,
p209
aVeven though old as well as young people
p210
aVbuy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.
p211
aVJust think, what's the last time you saw
p212
aVa Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people
p213
aV85 years old? Never.
p214
aVInstead, the only American ads
p215
aVfeaturing white-haired old people
p216
aVare ads for retirement homes and pension planning.
p217
aa(lp218
VWell, what has changed in the status
p219
aVof the elderly today
p220
aVcompared to their status in traditional societies?
p221
aVThere have been a few changes for the better
p222
aVand more changes for the worse.
p223
aVBig changes for the better
p224
aVinclude the fact that today we enjoy
p225
aVmuch longer lives,
p226
aVmuch better health in our old age,
p227
aVand much better recreational opportunities.
p228
aVAnother change for the better is that we now have
p229
aVspecialized retirement facilities
p230
aVand programs to take care of old people.
p231
aVChanges for the worse begin with the cruel reality
p232
aVthat we now have
p233
aVmore old people and fewer young people
p234
aVthan at any time in the past.
p235
aVThat means that all those old people
p236
aVare more of a burden on the few young people,
p237
aVand that each old person has less individual value.
p238
aVAnother big change for the worse in the status of the elderly
p239
aVis the breaking of social ties with age,
p240
aVbecause older people, their children,
p241
aVand their friends,
p242
aVall move and scatter independently of each other
p243
aVmany times during their lives.
p244
aVWe Americans move on the average
p245
aVevery five years.
p246
aVHence our older people are likely
p247
aVto end up living distant from their children
p248
aVand the friends of their youth.
p249
aVYet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly
p250
aVis formal retirement from the workforce,
p251
aVcarrying with it a loss of work friendships
p252
aVand a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.
p253
aVPerhaps the biggest change for the worse
p254
aVis that our elderly are objectively
p255
aVless useful than in traditional societies.
p256
aVWidespread literacy means that they are no longer
p257
aVuseful as repositories of knowledge.
p258
aVWhen we want some information,
p259
aVwe look it up in a book or we Google it
p260
aVinstead of finding some old person to ask.
p261
aVThe slow pace of technological change
p262
aVin traditional societies
p263
aVmeans that what someone learns there as a child
p264
aVis still useful when that person is old,
p265
aVbut the rapid pace of technological change today
p266
aVmeans that what we learn as children
p267
aVis no longer useful 60 years later.
p268
aVAnd conversely, we older people are not fluent
p269
aVin the technologies essential for surviving
p270
aVin modern society.
p271
aVFor example, as a 15-year-old,
p272
aVI was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers
p273
aVbecause I had memorized the multiplication tables
p274
aVand I know how to use logarithms
p275
aVand I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule.
p276
aVToday, though, those skills are utterly useless
p277
aVbecause any idiot
p278
aVcan now multiply eight-digit numbers
p279
aVaccurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.
p280
aVConversely, I at age 75
p281
aVam incompetent at skills
p282
aVessential for everyday life.
p283
aVMy family's first TV set in 1948
p284
aVhad only three knobs that I quickly mastered:
p285
aVan on-off switch, a volume knob,
p286
aVand a channel selector knob.
p287
aVToday, just to watch a program
p288
aVon the TV set in my own house,
p289
aVI have to operate a 41-button TV remote
p290
aVthat utterly defeats me.
p291
aVI have to telephone my 25-year-old sons
p292
aVand ask them to talk me through it
p293
aVwhile I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.
p294
aa(lp295
VWhat can we do to improve the lives of the elderly
p296
aVin the U.S., and to make better use of their value?
p297
aVThat's a huge problem.
p298
aVIn my remaining four minutes today,
p299
aVI can offer just a few suggestions.
p300
aVOne value of older people is that they are
p301
aVincreasingly useful as grandparents
p302
aVfor offering high-quality childcare
p303
aVto their grandchildren, if they choose to do it,
p304
aVas more young women enter the workforce
p305
aVand as fewer young parents of either gender
p306
aVstay home as full-time caretakers of their children.
p307
aVCompared to the usual alternatives
p308
aVof paid babysitters and day care centers,
p309
aVgrandparents offer superior, motivated,
p310
aVexperienced child care.
p311
aVThey've already gained experience from raising their own children.
p312
aVThey usually love their grandchildren,
p313
aVand are eager to spend time with them.
p314
aVUnlike other caregivers,
p315
aVgrandparents don't quit their job
p316
aVbecause they found another job with higher pay
p317
aVlooking after another baby.
p318
aVA second value of older people is paradoxically
p319
aVrelated to their loss of value
p320
aVas a result of changing world conditions and technology.
p321
aVAt the same time, older people have gained
p322
aVin value today precisely because
p323
aVof their unique experience of living conditions
p324
aVthat have now become rare
p325
aVbecause of rapid change, but that could come back.
p326
aVFor example, only Americans now in their 70s
p327
aVor older today can remember
p328
aVthe experience of living through a great depression,
p329
aVthe experience of living through a world war,
p330
aVand agonizing whether or not
p331
aVdropping atomic bombs would be more horrible
p332
aVthan the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs.
p333
aVMost of our current voters and politicians
p334
aVhave no personal experience of any of those things,
p335
aVbut millions of older Americans do.
p336
aVUnfortunately, all of those terrible situations
p337
aVcould come back.
p338
aVEven if they don't come back,
p339
aVwe have to be able to plan for them
p340
aVon the basis of the experience of what they were like.
p341
aVOlder people have that experience.
p342
aVYounger people don't.
p343
aa(lp344
VThe remaining value of older people
p345
aVthat I'll mention involves recognizing that
p346
aVwhile there are many things that older people
p347
aVcan no longer do,
p348
aVthere are other things that they can do
p349
aVbetter than younger people.
p350
aVA challenge for society is  to make use of those things
p351
aVthat older people are better at doing.
p352
aVSome abilities, of course, decrease with age.
p353
aVThose include abilities at tasks
p354
aVrequiring physical strength and stamina,
p355
aVambition, and the power of novel reasoning
p356
aVin a circumscribed situation,
p357
aVsuch as figuring out the structure of DNA,
p358
aVbest left to scientists under the age of 30.
p359
aVConversely, valuable attributes
p360
aVthat increase with age include experience,
p361
aVunderstanding of people and human relationships,
p362
aVability to help other people
p363
aVwithout your own ego getting in the way,
p364
aVand interdisciplinary thinking about large databases,
p365
aVsuch as economics and comparative history,
p366
aVbest left to scholars over the age of 60.
p367
aVHence older people are much better than younger people
p368
aVat supervising, administering, advising,
p369
aVstrategizing, teaching, synthesizing,
p370
aVand devising long-term plans.
p371
aVI've seen this value of older people
p372
aVwith so many of my friends in their 60s,
p373
aV70s, 80s and 90s,
p374
aVwho are still active as investment managers,
p375
aVfarmers, lawyers and doctors.
p376
aVIn short, many traditional societies
p377
aVmake better use of their elderly
p378
aVand give their elderly more satisfying lives
p379
aVthan we do in modern, big societies.
p380
aa(lp381
VParadoxically nowadays,
p382
aVwhen we have more elderly people than ever before,
p383
aVliving healthier lives and with better medical care
p384
aVthan ever before,
p385
aVold age is in some respects more miserable
p386
aVthan ever before.
p387
aVThe lives of the elderly are widely recognized
p388
aVas constituting a disaster area
p389
aVof modern American society.
p390
aVWe can surely do better by learning
p391
aVfrom the lives of the elderly
p392
aVin traditional societies.
p393
aVBut what's true of the lives of the elderly
p394
aVin traditional societies
p395
aVis true of many other features
p396
aVof traditional societies as well.
p397
aVOf course, I'm not advocating that we all give up
p398
aVagriculture and metal tools
p399
aVand return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
p400
aVThere are many obvious respects
p401
aVin which our lives today are far happier
p402
aVthan those in small, traditional societies.
p403
aVTo mention just a few examples,
p404
aVour lives are longer, materially much richer,
p405
aVand less plagued by violence
p406
aVthan are the lives of people in traditional societies.
p407
aVBut there are also things to be admired
p408
aVabout people in traditional societies,
p409
aVand perhaps to be learned from them.
p410
aVTheir lives are usually socially much richer
p411
aVthan our lives,
p412
aValthough materially poorer.
p413
aVTheir children are more self-confident,
p414
aVmore independent, and more socially skilled
p415
aVthan are our children.
p416
aVThey think more realistically about dangers than we do.
p417
aVThey almost never die of diabetes, heart disease,
p418
aVstroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases
p419
aVthat will be the causes of death of almost
p420
aVall of us in this room today.
p421
aVFeatures of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases,
p422
aVand features of the traditional lifestyle
p423
aVprotect us against them.
p424
aa(lp425
VThose are just some examples of what we can learn
p426
aVfrom traditional societies.
p427
aVI hope that you will find it as fascinating
p428
aVto read about traditional societies
p429
aVas I found it to live in those societies.
p430
aa(lp431
VThank you.

VOne out of two of you women
p5
aVwill be impacted by cardiovascular disease
p6
aVin your lifetime.
p7
aVSo this is the leading killer of women.
p8
aVIt's a closely held secret
p9
aVfor reasons I don't know.
p10
aVIn addition to making this personal \u2014
p11
aVso we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart
p12
aVand all women's relationship with their heart \u2014
p13
aVwe're going to wax into the politics.
p14
aVBecause the personal, as you know, is political.
p15
aVAnd not enough is being done about this.
p16
aVAnd as we have watched women
p17
aVconquer breast cancer
p18
aVthrough the breast cancer campaign,
p19
aVthis is what we need to do now with heart.
p20
aa(lp21
VSince 1984,
p22
aVmore women die in the U.S. than men.
p23
aVSo where we used to think of heart disease
p24
aVas being a man's problem primarily \u2014
p25
aVwhich that was never true,
p26
aVbut that was kind of how everybody thought in the 1950s and '60s,
p27
aVand it was in all the textbooks.
p28
aVIt's certainly what I learned when I was training.
p29
aVIf we were to remain sexist, and that was not right,
p30
aVbut if we were going to go forward and be sexist,
p31
aVit's actually a woman's disease.
p32
aVSo it's a woman's disease now.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd one of the things that you see
p35
aVis that male line,
p36
aVthe mortality is going down, down, down, down, down.
p37
aVAnd you see the female line since 1984,
p38
aVthe gap is widening.
p39
aVMore and more women, two, three, four times more women,
p40
aVdying of heart disease than men.
p41
aVAnd that's too short of a time period
p42
aVfor all the different risk factors that we know
p43
aVto change.
p44
aVSo what this really suggested to us
p45
aVat the national level
p46
aVwas that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies,
p47
aVwhich had been developed in men, by men, for men
p48
aVfor the last 50 years \u2014
p49
aVand they work pretty well in men, don't they? \u2014
p50
aVweren't working so well for women.
p51
aVSo that was a big wake-up call
p52
aVin the 1980's.
p53
aa(lp54
VHeart disease kills more women
p55
aVat all ages
p56
aVthan breast cancer.
p57
aVAnd the breast cancer campaign \u2014
p58
aVagain, this is not a competition.
p59
aVWe're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign.
p60
aVWe need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign
p61
aVto address this crisis.
p62
aVNow sometimes when people see this,
p63
aVI hear this gasp.
p64
aVWe can all think of someone,
p65
aVoften a young woman,
p66
aVwho has been impacted by breast cancer.
p67
aVWe often can't think of a young woman
p68
aVwho has heart disease.
p69
aVI'm going to tell you why.
p70
aVHeart disease kills people,
p71
aVoften very quickly.
p72
aVSo the first time heart disease strikes in women and men,
p73
aVhalf of the time it's sudden cardiac death \u2014
p74
aVno opportunity to say good-bye,
p75
aVno opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy,
p76
aVno opportunity to help her pick out a wig.
p77
aa(lp78
VBreast cancer,
p79
aVmortality is down to four percent.
p80
aVAnd that is the 40 years
p81
aVthat women have advocated.
p82
aVBetty Ford, Nancy Reagan stood up
p83
aVand said, "I'm a breast cancer survivor,"
p84
aVand it was okay to talk about it.
p85
aVAnd then physicians have gone to bat.
p86
aVWe've done the research.
p87
aVWe have effective therapies now.
p88
aVWomen are living longer than ever.
p89
aVThat has to happen in heart disease, and it's time.
p90
aVIt's not happening, and it's time.
p91
aa(lp92
VWe owe an incredible debt of gratitude
p93
aVto these two women.
p94
aVAs Barbara depicted
p95
aVin one of her amazing movies, "Yentl,"
p96
aVshe portrayed a young woman
p97
aVwho wanted an education.
p98
aVAnd she wanted to study the Talmud.
p99
aVAnd so how did she get educated then?
p100
aVShe had to impersonate a man.
p101
aVShe had to look like a man.
p102
aVShe had to make other people believe that she looked like a man
p103
aVand she could have the same rights
p104
aVthat the men had.
p105
aVBernadine Healy, Dr. Healy,
p106
aVwas a cardiologist.
p107
aVAnd right around that time, in the 1980's,
p108
aVthat we saw women and heart disease deaths
p109
aVgoing up, up, up, up, up,
p110
aVshe wrote an editorial
p111
aVin the New England Journal of Medicine
p112
aVand said, the Yentl syndrome.
p113
aVWomen are dying of heart disease,
p114
aVtwo, three, four times more than men.
p115
aVMortality is not going down, it's going up.
p116
aVAnd she questioned,
p117
aVshe hypothesized,
p118
aVis this a Yentl syndrome?
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd here's what the story is.
p121
aVIs it because women don't look like men,
p122
aVthey don't look like that male-pattern heart disease
p123
aVthat we've spent the last 50 years understanding
p124
aVand getting really good diagnostics
p125
aVand really good therapeutics,
p126
aVand therefore, they're not recognized for their heart disease.
p127
aVAnd they're just passed.
p128
aVThey don't get treated, they don't get detected,
p129
aVthey don't get the benefit of all the modern medicines.
p130
aa(lp131
VDoctor Healy then subsequently became
p132
aVthe first female director
p133
aVof our National Institutes of Health.
p134
aVAnd this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research
p135
aVin the world.
p136
aVAnd it funds a lot of my research.
p137
aVIt funds research all over the place.
p138
aVIt was a very big deal
p139
aVfor her to become director.
p140
aVAnd she started,
p141
aVin the face of a lot of controversy,
p142
aVthe Women's Health Initiative.
p143
aVAnd every woman in the room here
p144
aVhas benefited from that Women's Health Initiative.
p145
aVIt told us about hormone replacement therapy.
p146
aVIt's informed us about osteoporosis.
p147
aVIt informed us about breast cancer, colon cancer in women.
p148
aVSo a tremendous fund of knowledge
p149
aVdespite, again,
p150
aVthat so many people told her not to do it,
p151
aVit was too expensive.
p152
aVAnd the under-reading was women aren't worth it.
p153
aVShe was like, "Nope. Sorry. Women are worth it."
p154
aa(lp155
VWell there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative
p156
aVthat went to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,
p157
aVwhich is the cardiology part of the NIH.
p158
aVAnd we got to do the WISE study \u2014
p159
aVand the WISE stands for Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation \u2014
p160
aVand I have chaired this study for the last 15 years.
p161
aVIt was a study to specifically ask,
p162
aVwhat's going on with women?
p163
aVWhy are more and more women dying
p164
aVof ischemic heart disease?
p165
aVSo in the WISE, 15 years ago,
p166
aVwe started out and said, "Well wow, there's a couple of key observations
p167
aVand we should probably follow up on that."
p168
aVAnd our colleagues in Washington, D.C.
p169
aVhad recently published
p170
aVthat when women have heart attacks and die,
p171
aVcompared to men who have heart attacks and die \u2014
p172
aVand again, this is millions of people,
p173
aVhappening every day \u2014
p174
aVwomen, in their fatty plaque \u2014
p175
aVand this is their coronary artery,
p176
aVso the main blood supply going into the heart muscle \u2014
p177
aVwomen erode,
p178
aVmen explode.
p179
aVYou're going to find some interesting analogies
p180
aVin this physiology.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VSo I'll describe the male-pattern heart attack first.
p185
aVHollywood heart attack. Ughhhh.
p186
aVHorrible chest pain.
p187
aVEKG goes pbbrrhh,
p188
aVso the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG.
p189
aVThere's a big clot in the middle of the artery.
p190
aVAnd they go up to the cath lab
p191
aVand boom, boom, boom get rid of the clot.
p192
aVThat's a man heart attack.
p193
aVSome women have those heart attacks,
p194
aVbut a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack,
p195
aVwhere it erodes,
p196
aVdoesn't completely fill with clot, symptoms are subtle,
p197
aVEKG findings are different \u2014
p198
aVfemale-pattern.
p199
aVSo what do you think happens to these gals?
p200
aVThey're often not recognized, sent home.
p201
aVI'm not sure what it was. Might have been gas.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo we picked up on that
p204
aVand we said, "You know, we now have the ability
p205
aVto look inside human beings
p206
aVwith these special catheters called IVUS:
p207
aVintravascular ultrasound."
p208
aVAnd we said, "We're going to hypothesize
p209
aVthat the fatty plaque in women
p210
aVis actually probably different,
p211
aVand deposited differently, than men."
p212
aVAnd because of the common knowledge
p213
aVof how women and men get fat.
p214
aVWhen we watch people become obese,
p215
aVwhere do men get fat?
p216
aVRight here, it's just a focal \u2014 right there.
p217
aVWhere do women get fat?
p218
aVAll over.
p219
aVCellulite here, cellulite here.
p220
aVSo we said, "Look, women look like they're pretty good
p221
aVabout putting kind of the garbage away,
p222
aVsmoothly putting it away.
p223
aVMen just have to dump it in a single area."
p224
aVSo we said, "Let's look at these."
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd so the yellow is the fatty plaque,
p227
aVand panel A is a man.
p228
aVAnd you can see, it's lumpy bumpy.
p229
aVHe's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries.
p230
aVPanel B is the woman, very smooth.
p231
aVShe's just laid it down nice and tidy.
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aVAnd if you did that angiogram,
p234
aVwhich is the red,
p235
aVyou can see the man's disease.
p236
aVSo 50 years
p237
aVof honing and crafting these angiograms,
p238
aVwe easily recognize
p239
aVmale-pattern disease.
p240
aVKind of hard to see that female-pattern disease.
p241
aVSo that was a discovery.
p242
aVNow what are the implications of that?
p243
aVWell once again, women get the angiogram
p244
aVand nobody can tell that they have a problem.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo we are working now on a non-invasive \u2014
p247
aVagain, these are all invasive studies.
p248
aVIdeally you would love to do all this non-invasively.
p249
aVAnd again, 50 years
p250
aVof good non-invasive stress testing,
p251
aVwe're pretty good at recognizing male-pattern disease
p252
aVwith stress tests.
p253
aVSo this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
p254
aVWe're doing this at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute
p255
aVin the Women's Heart Center.
p256
aVWe selected this for the research.
p257
aVThis is not in your community hospital,
p258
aVbut we would hope to translate this.
p259
aVAnd we're about two and a half years
p260
aVinto a five-year study.
p261
aa(lp262
VThis was the only modality
p263
aVthat can see the inner lining of the heart.
p264
aVAnd if you look carefully, you can see
p265
aVthat there's a black blush right there.
p266
aVAnd that is microvascular obstruction.
p267
aVThe syndrome, the female-pattern
p268
aVnow is called microvascular coronary dysfunction, or obstruction.
p269
aVThe second reason we really liked MRI
p270
aVis that there's no radiation.
p271
aVSo unlike the CAT scans, X-rays, thalliums,
p272
aVfor women
p273
aVwhose breast is in the way
p274
aVof looking at the heart,
p275
aVevery time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation,
p276
aVwe say, "Do we really need that test?"
p277
aVSo we're very excited about M.R.
p278
aVYou can't go and order it yet,
p279
aVbut this is an area of active inquiry
p280
aVwhere actually studying women
p281
aVis going to advance the field for women and men.
p282
aa(lp283
VWhat are the downstream consequences
p284
aVthen, when female-pattern heart disease
p285
aVis not recognized?
p286
aVThis is a figure
p287
aVfrom an editorial that I published
p288
aVin the European Heart Journal this last summer.
p289
aVAnd it was just a pictogram
p290
aVto sort of show
p291
aVwhy more women are dying of heart disease,
p292
aVdespite these good treatments
p293
aVthat we know and we have work.
p294
aVAnd when the woman
p295
aVhas male-pattern disease \u2014
p296
aVso she looks like Barbara in the movie \u2014
p297
aVthey get treated.
p298
aVAnd when you have female-pattern and you look like a woman,
p299
aVas Barbara does here with her husband,
p300
aVthey don't get the treatment.
p301
aVThese are our life-saving treatments.
p302
aVAnd those little red boxes are deaths.
p303
aVSo those are the consequences.
p304
aVAnd that is female-pattern
p305
aVand why we think the Yentl syndrome
p306
aVactually is explaining
p307
aVa lot of these gaps.
p308
aa(lp309
VThere's been wonderful news also
p310
aVabout studying women,
p311
aVfinally, in heart disease.
p312
aVAnd one of the the cutting-edge areas
p313
aVthat we're just incredibly excited about
p314
aVis stem cell therapy.
p315
aVIf you ask, what is the big difference
p316
aVbetween women and men physiologically?
p317
aVWhy are there women and men?
p318
aVBecause women bring new life into the world.
p319
aVThat's all stem cells.
p320
aVSo we hypothesized
p321
aVthat female stem cells might be better
p322
aVat identifying the injury,
p323
aVdoing some cellular repair
p324
aVor even producing new organs,
p325
aVwhich is one of the things
p326
aVthat we're trying to do with stem cell therapy.
p327
aVThese are female and male stem cells.
p328
aVAnd if you had an injured organ,
p329
aVif you had a heart attack
p330
aVand we wanted to repair that injured area,
p331
aVdo you want those robust,
p332
aVplentiful stem cells on the top?
p333
aVOr do you want these guys,
p334
aVthat look like they're out to lunch?
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd some of our investigative teams
p339
aVhave demonstrated
p340
aVthat female stem cells \u2014
p341
aVand this is in animals
p342
aVand increasingly we're showing this in humans \u2014
p343
aVthat female stem cells,
p344
aVwhen put even into a male body,
p345
aVdo better than male stem cells
p346
aVgoing into a male body.
p347
aVOne of the things that we say
p348
aVabout all of this female physiology \u2014
p349
aVbecause again, as much as we're talking about women and heart disease,
p350
aVwomen do, on average,
p351
aVhave better longevity than men \u2014
p352
aVis that unfolding the secrets of female physiology
p353
aVand understanding that
p354
aVis going to help men and women.
p355
aVSo this is not a zero-sum game in anyway.
p356
aa(lp357
VOkay, so here's where we started.
p358
aVAnd remember, paths crossed in 1984,
p359
aVand more and more women
p360
aVwere dying of cardiovascular disease.
p361
aVWhat has happened in the last 15 years with this work?
p362
aVWe are bending the curve.
p363
aVWe're bending the curve.
p364
aVSo just like the breast cancer story,
p365
aVdoing research, getting awareness going,
p366
aVit works, you just have to get it going.
p367
aVNow are we happy with this?
p368
aVWe still have two to three more women dying for every man.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd I would propose,
p371
aVwith the better longevity
p372
aVthat women have overall,
p373
aVthat women probably should theoretically do better,
p374
aVif we could just get treated.
p375
aVSo this is where we are,
p376
aVbut we have a long row to hoe.
p377
aVWe've worked on this for 15 years.
p378
aVAnd I've told you, we've been working on male-pattern heart disease
p379
aVfor 50 years.
p380
aVSo we're 35 years behind.
p381
aVAnd we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years.
p382
aVAnd in fact, it probably won't.
p383
aVBut we cannot stop now.
p384
aVToo many lives are at stake.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo what do we need to do?
p387
aVYou now, hopefully, have a more personal relationship
p388
aVwith your heart.
p389
aVWomen have heard the call
p390
aVfor breast cancer
p391
aVand they have come out
p392
aVfor awareness campaigns.
p393
aVThe women are very good about getting mammograms now.
p394
aVAnd women do fundraising.
p395
aVWomen participate.
p396
aVThey have put their money where their mouth is
p397
aVand they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns.
p398
aVThis is what we need to do with heart disease now.
p399
aa(lp400
VAnd it's political.
p401
aVWomen's health, from a federal funding standpoint,
p402
aVsometimes it's popular,
p403
aVsometimes it's not so popular.
p404
aVSo we have these feast and famine cycles.
p405
aVSo I implore you
p406
aVto join the Red Dress Campaign
p407
aVin this fundraising.
p408
aVBreast cancer, as we said,
p409
aVkills women,
p410
aVbut heart disease kills a whole bunch more.
p411
aVSo if we can be as good as breast cancer
p412
aVand give women this new charge,
p413
aVwe have a lot of lives to save.
p414
aa(lp415
VSo thank you for your attention.
p416

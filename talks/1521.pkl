VI'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.
p5
aVAnd I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you
p6
aVsuffer from it as well.
p7
aVWhen I'm walking around an art gallery,
p8
aVrooms and rooms full of paintings,
p9
aVafter about 15 or 20 minutes,
p10
aVI realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.
p11
aVI'm not connecting to them.
p12
aVInstead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee
p13
aVI desperately need to wake me up.
p14
aVI'm suffering from gallery fatigue.
p15
aa(lp16
VHow many of you out there suffer from \u2014
p17
aVyes. Ha ha, ha ha!
p18
aVNow, sometimes you might last longer
p19
aVthan 20 minutes, or even shorter,
p20
aVbut I think we all suffer from it. And do you have
p21
aVthe accompanying guilt?
p22
aVFor me, I look at the paintings on the wall
p23
aVand I think, somebody has decided to put them there,
p24
aVthinks they're good enough to be on that wall,
p25
aVbut I don't always see it.
p26
aVIn fact, most of the time I don't see it.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd I leave feeling actually unhappy.
p29
aVI feel guilty and unhappy with myself,
p30
aVrather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting,
p31
aVI think there's something wrong with me.
p32
aVAnd that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VThe thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.
p37
aVIf you think about going into a restaurant,
p38
aVwhen you look at the menu, are you expected to order
p39
aVevery single thing on the menu?
p40
aVNo! You select.
p41
aVIf you go into a department store to buy a shirt,
p42
aVare you going to try on every single shirt
p43
aVand want every single shirt?
p44
aVOf course not, you can be selective. It's expected.
p45
aVHow come, then, it's not so expected
p46
aVto be selective when we go to an art gallery?
p47
aVWhy are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?
p48
aa(lp49
VWell I'm trying to take a different approach.
p50
aVAnd there's two things I do:
p51
aVWhen I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast,
p52
aVand I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones
p53
aVthat make me slow down for some reason or other.
p54
aVI don't even know why they make me slow down, but something
p55
aVpulls me like a magnet
p56
aVand then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.
p57
aVSo it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.
p58
aVI choose a painting. It might just be one painting in 50.
p59
aVAnd then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting,
p60
aVand I tell myself a story about it.
p61
aa(lp62
VWhy a story? Well, I think that we are wired,
p63
aVour DNA tells us to tell stories.
p64
aVWe tell stories all the time about everything,
p65
aVand I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place,
p66
aVand sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit,
p67
aVtrying to bring some order to it.
p68
aVWhy not apply that to our looking at paintings?
p69
aVSo I now have this sort of restaurant menu
p70
aVvisiting of art galleries.
p71
aa(lp72
VThere are three paintings I'm going to show you now
p73
aVthat are paintings that made me stop in my tracks
p74
aVand want to tell stories about them.
p75
aVThe first one needs little introduction \u2014
p76
aV"Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer,
p77
aV17th-century Dutch painter.
p78
aVThis is the most glorious painting.
p79
aVI first saw it when I was 19,
p80
aVand I immediately went out and got a poster of it,
p81
aVand in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.
p82
aVIt's accompanied me everywhere I've gone,
p83
aVI never tire of looking at her.
p84
aa(lp85
VWhat made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with
p86
aVwas just the gorgeous colors he uses
p87
aVand the light falling on her face.
p88
aVBut I think what's kept me still coming back
p89
aVyear after year is another thing, and that is
p90
aVthe look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.
p91
aVI can't tell if she's happy or sad,
p92
aVand I change my mind all the time.
p93
aVSo that keeps me coming back.
p94
aa(lp95
VOne day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall,
p96
aVI lay in bed and looked at her,
p97
aVand I suddenly thought, I wonder what
p98
aVthe painter did to her to make her look like that.
p99
aVAnd it was the first time I'd ever thought that
p100
aVthe expression on her face is actually reflecting
p101
aVhow she feels about him.
p102
aVAlways before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl.
p103
aVNow I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.
p104
aVAnd I thought, well, what is that relationship?
p105
aa(lp106
VSo I went to find out. I did some research and discovered,
p107
aVwe have no idea who she is.
p108
aVIn fact, we don't know who any of the models
p109
aVin any of Vermeer's paintings are,
p110
aVand we know very little about Vermeer himself.
p111
aVWhich made me go, "Yippee!"
p112
aVI can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo here's how I came up with the story.
p115
aVFirst of all, I thought,
p116
aVI've got to get her into the house.
p117
aVHow does Vermeer know her?
p118
aVWell, there've been suggestions that
p119
aVshe is his 12-year-old daughter.
p120
aVThe daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.
p121
aVAnd I thought, no, it's a very intimate look,
p122
aVbut it's not a look a daughter gives her father.
p123
aVFor one thing, in Dutch painting of the time,
p124
aVif a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.
p125
aVIt would have been inappropriate for Vermeer
p126
aVto paint his daughter like that.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo it's not his daughter, but it's somebody
p129
aVclose to him, physically close to him.
p130
aVWell, who else would be in the house?
p131
aVA servant, a lovely servant.
p132
aVSo, she's in the house.
p133
aVHow do we get her into the studio?
p134
aVWe don't know very much about Vermeer,
p135
aVbut the little bits that we do know, one thing we know
p136
aVis that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother
p137
aVin a house where he had his own room
p138
aVwhere he \u2014 his studio. He also had 11 children.
p139
aVIt would have been a chaotic, noisy household.
p140
aVAnd if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before,
p141
aVyou know that they're incredibly calm and quiet.
p142
aa(lp143
VHow does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?
p144
aVWell, he compartmentalizes his life.
p145
aVHe gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.
p146
aVNot the wife, not the kids. Okay, the maid can come in and clean."
p147
aVShe's in the studio. He's got her in the studio, they're together.
p148
aVAnd he decides to paint her.
p149
aa(lp150
VHe has her wear very plain clothes.
p151
aVNow, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings
p152
aVwore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials.
p153
aVThis is very plain; the only thing that isn't plain
p154
aVis her pearl earring.
p155
aVNow, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford
p156
aVa pair of pearl earrings.
p157
aVSo those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they?
p158
aVWe happen to know, there's a list of Catharina, the wife's clothes.
p159
aVAmongst them a yellow coat with white fur,
p160
aVa yellow and black bodice,
p161
aVand you see these clothes on lots of other paintings,
p162
aVdifferent women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.
p163
aVSo clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.
p164
aVIt's not such a leap of faith to take
p165
aVthat that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo we've got all the elements for our story.
p168
aVShe's in the studio with him for a long time.
p169
aVThese paintings took a long time to make.
p170
aVThey would have spent the time alone, all that time.
p171
aVShe's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
p172
aVShe's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted.
p173
aVAnd does the wife know? Maybe not.
p174
aVAnd if she doesn't, well \u2014
p175
aVthat's the story.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VThe next painting I'm going to talk about
p180
aVis called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin.
p181
aVHe's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes,
p182
aVbut he did occasionally paint people.
p183
aVAnd in fact, he painted four versions of this painting,
p184
aVdifferent boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.
p185
aVI like this version the best, because some of the boys
p186
aVare older and some are younger, and to me, this one,
p187
aVlike Goldilocks's porridge, is just right.
p188
aa(lp189
VHe's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.
p190
aVHe's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience,
p191
aVand that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
p192
aVAnd I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.
p193
aVThe light comes in from the left, his face is bathed
p194
aVin this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting,
p195
aVand you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it,
p196
aVI was standing there going,
p197
aV"Look at me. Please look at me."
p198
aVAnd he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards,
p199
aVand that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is,
p200
aVhe's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us.
p201
aVAnd that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece,
p202
aVof a painting when there's a lack of resolution.
p203
aVHe's never going to look at me.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo I was thinking of a story where,
p206
aVif I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?
p207
aVNot the painter, I don't want to think about the painter.
p208
aVI'm thinking of an older version of himself.
p209
aVHe's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant,
p210
aVsaying, "Look at me. I want to warn you about
p211
aVwhat you're about to go through. Please look at me."
p212
aVAnd he never does.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" \u2014
p215
aVwe don't know if she's happy or sad.
p216
aVI've written an entire novel about her,
p217
aVand I still don't know if she's happy or sad.
p218
aVAgain and again, back to the painting,
p219
aVlooking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.
p220
aVAnd we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily,
p221
aVbut not really, and we come back again and again.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe last painting I'm going to talk about
p224
aVis called "Anonymous" by anonymous. (Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VThis is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.
p227
aVThey thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury,
p228
aVand then they discovered that it wasn't him,
p229
aVand they have no idea who it is.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow, in the National Portrait Gallery,
p232
aVif you don't know the biography of the painting,
p233
aVit's kind of useless to you.
p234
aVThey can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.
p235
aVSo unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage,
p236
aValong with quite a number of other orphans,
p237
aVsome of them some beautiful paintings.
p238
aa(lp239
VThis painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons:
p240
aVOne is the disconnection between his mouth
p241
aVthat's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.
p242
aVHe's not happy, and why isn't he happy?
p243
aVThe second thing that really attracted me
p244
aVwere his bright red cheeks.
p245
aVHe is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made!
p246
aVThis must be a guy who blushes all the time.
p247
aVWhat is he thinking about that's making him blush?
p248
aVThe third thing that made me stop in my tracks
p249
aVis his absolutely gorgeous doublet.
p250
aVSilk, gray, those beautiful buttons.
p251
aVAnd you know what it makes me think of,
p252
aVis it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed.
p253
aa(lp254
VI kept thinking of beds and red cheeks,
p255
aVand of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him,
p256
aVand I thought, is that what he's thinking about?
p257
aVAnd I thought, if I'm going to make a story,
p258
aVwhat's the last thing I'm going to put in there?
p259
aVWell, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?
p260
aVAnd I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.
p261
aVHe'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.
p262
aVWho is going to inherit his name and his fortune?
p263
aVYou put all those together, and you've got your story
p264
aVto fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.
p265
aVNow, here's the story.
p266
aVIt's short.
p267
aa(lp268
V"Rosy"
p269
aa(lp270
VI am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.
p271
aVIt has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves
p272
aVand intricate buttons of twisted silk thread,
p273
aVset close together so that the fit is snug.
p274
aVThe doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.
p275
aVPerhaps that was the intention.
p276
aVI first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.
p277
aVI knew even before I stood up to speak
p278
aVthat my cheeks were inflamed.
p279
aVI have always flushed easily, from physical exertion,
p280
aVfrom wine, from high emotion.
p281
aa(lp282
VAs a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys,
p283
aVbut not by George.
p284
aVOnly George could call me Rosy.
p285
aVI would not allow anyone else.
p286
aVHe managed to make the word tender.
p287
aVWhen I made the announcement, George did not
p288
aVturn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.
p289
aVHe should not have been surprised.
p290
aVIt has been a common assumption
p291
aVthat I would one day marry his cousin.
p292
aVBut it is difficult to hear the words aloud.
p293
aVI know, I could barely utter them.
p294
aa(lp295
VAfterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.
p296
aVDespite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.
p297
aVWe stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.
p298
aV"What do you think of my doublet?" I asked.
p299
aa(lp300
VHe glanced at me. "That collar looks to be strangling you."
p301
aa(lp302
V"We will still see each other," I insisted.
p303
aV"We can still hunt and play cards and attend court.
p304
aVNothing need change."
p305
aVGeorge did not speak.
p306
aV"I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marry
p307
aVand produce an heir. It is expected of me."
p308
aa(lp309
VGeorge drained another glass of claret and turned to me.
p310
aV"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James.
p311
aVI'm sure you'll be content together."
p312
aVHe never used my nickname again.
p313
aa(lp314
VThank you.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Applause)
p317
aa(lp318
VThank you.
p319

VSo what does the happiest man in the world look like?
p5
aVHe certainly doesn't look like me.
p6
aVHe looks like this.
p7
aVHis name is Matthieu Ricard.
p8
aVSo how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?
p9
aVWell it turns out
p10
aVthere is a way to measure happiness in the brain.
p11
aVAnd you do that by measuring the relative activation
p12
aVof the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI,
p13
aVversus the right prefrontal cortex.
p14
aVAnd Matthieu's happiness measure
p15
aVis off the charts.
p16
aVHe's by far the happiest man
p17
aVever measured by science.
p18
aVWhich leads us to a question:
p19
aVWhat was he thinking when he was being measured?
p20
aVPerhaps something very naughty.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVActually, he was meditating
p23
aVon compassion.
p24
aVMatthieu's own experience
p25
aVis that compassion is the happiest state ever.
p26
aa(lp27
VReading about Matthieu
p28
aVwas one of the pivotal moments of my life.
p29
aVMy dream
p30
aVis to create the conditions
p31
aVfor world peace in my lifetime \u2014
p32
aVand to do that
p33
aVby creating the conditions
p34
aVfor inner peace
p35
aVand compassion
p36
aVon a global scale.
p37
aVAnd learning about Matthieu
p38
aVgave me a new angle to look at my work.
p39
aVMatthieu's brain scan shows
p40
aVthat compassion is not a chore.
p41
aVCompassion is something that creates happiness.
p42
aVCompassion is fun.
p43
aVAnd that mind-blowing insight
p44
aVchanges the entire game.
p45
aVBecause if compassion was a chore,
p46
aVnobody's going to do it,
p47
aVexcept maybe the Dalai Lama or something.
p48
aVBut if compassion was fun,
p49
aVeverybody's going to do it.
p50
aVTherefore,
p51
aVto create the conditions for global compassion,
p52
aVall we have to do
p53
aVis to reframe compassion
p54
aVas something that is fun.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut fun is not enough.
p57
aVWhat if compassion
p58
aVis also profitable?
p59
aVWhat if compassion is also good for business?
p60
aVThen, every boss, every manager in the world,
p61
aVwill want to have compassion \u2014
p62
aVlike this.
p63
aVThat would create the conditions
p64
aVfor world peace.
p65
aVSo, I started paying attention
p66
aVto what compassion looks like in a business setting.
p67
aVFortunately, I didn't have to look very far.
p68
aVBecause what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes \u2014
p69
aVin Google, my company.
p70
aa(lp71
VI know there are other compassionate companies in the world,
p72
aVbut Google is the place I'm familiar with
p73
aVbecause I've been there for 10 years,
p74
aVso I'll use Google as the case study.
p75
aVGoogle is a company
p76
aVborn of idealism.
p77
aVIt's a company that thrives on idealism.
p78
aVAnd maybe because of that,
p79
aVcompassion is organic
p80
aVand widespread company-wide.
p81
aVIn Google, expressions of corporate compassion
p82
aValmost always follow the same pattern.
p83
aVIt's sort of a funny pattern.
p84
aVIt starts with a small group of Googlers
p85
aVtaking the initiative to do something.
p86
aVAnd they don't usually ask for permission;
p87
aVthey just go ahead and do it,
p88
aVand then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.
p89
aVAnd sometimes it gets big enough
p90
aVto become official.
p91
aVSo in other words,
p92
aVit almost always starts from the bottom up.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd let me give you some examples.
p95
aVThe first example is the largest annual community event \u2014
p96
aVwhere Googlers from around the world
p97
aVdonate their labor to their local communities \u2014
p98
aVwas initiated and organized
p99
aVby three employees
p100
aVbefore it became official,
p101
aVbecause it just became too big.
p102
aVAnother example, three Googlers \u2014
p103
aVa chef, an engineer
p104
aVand, most funny, a massage therapist \u2014
p105
aVthree of them, they learned about a region in India
p106
aVwhere 200,000 people live
p107
aVwithout a single medical facility.
p108
aVSo what do they do?
p109
aVThey just go ahead and start a fundraiser.
p110
aVAnd they raise enough money to build this hospital \u2014
p111
aVthe first hospital of its kind
p112
aVfor 200,000 people.
p113
aVDuring the Haiti earthquake,
p114
aVa number of engineers and product managers
p115
aVspontaneously came together
p116
aVand stayed overnight
p117
aVto build a tool
p118
aVto allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.
p119
aVAnd expressions of compassion
p120
aVare also found in our international offices.
p121
aa(lp122
VIn China for example,
p123
aVone mid-level employee
p124
aVinitiated the largest social action competition in China,
p125
aVinvolving more than 1,000 schools in China,
p126
aVworking on issues
p127
aVsuch as education, poverty,
p128
aVhealth care and the environment.
p129
aVThere is so much organic social action
p130
aVall around Google
p131
aVthat the company decided to form
p132
aVa social responsibility team
p133
aVjust to support these efforts.
p134
aVAnd this idea, again,
p135
aVcame from the grassroots,
p136
aVfrom two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions
p137
aVand volunteered themselves for the job.
p138
aVAnd I found it fascinating
p139
aVthat the social responsibility team
p140
aVwas not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.
p141
aVIt was two persons saying, "Let's do this,"
p142
aVand the company said, "Yes."
p143
aVSo it turns out
p144
aVthat Google is a compassionate company,
p145
aVbecause Googlers found
p146
aVcompassion to be fun.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut again, fun is not enough.
p149
aVThere are also real business benefits.
p150
aVSo what are they?
p151
aVThe first benefit of compassion
p152
aVis that it creates highly effective business leaders.
p153
aVWhat does that mean?
p154
aVThere are three components of compassion.
p155
aVThere is the affective component,
p156
aVwhich is, "I feel for you."
p157
aVThere is the cognitive component,
p158
aVwhich is, "I understand you."
p159
aVAnd there is a motivational component,
p160
aVwhich is, "I want to help you."
p161
aVSo what has this got to do with business leadership?
p162
aVAccording to a very comprehensive study
p163
aVled by Jim Collins,
p164
aVand documented in the book "Good to Great,"
p165
aVit takes a very special kind of leader
p166
aVto bring a company
p167
aVfrom goodness to greatness.
p168
aVAnd he calls them "Level 5 leaders."
p169
aVThese are leaders
p170
aVwho, in addition to being highly capable,
p171
aVpossess two important qualities,
p172
aVand they are
p173
aVhumility and ambition.
p174
aVThese are leaders
p175
aVwho are highly ambitious for the greater good.
p176
aVAnd because they're ambitious for a greater good,
p177
aVthey feel no need to inflate their own egos.
p178
aVAnd they, according to the research,
p179
aVmake the best business leaders.
p180
aVAnd if you look at these qualities
p181
aVin the context of compassion,
p182
aVwe find
p183
aVthat the cognitive and affective components of compassion \u2014
p184
aVunderstanding people and empathizing with people \u2014
p185
aVinhibits, tones down,
p186
aVwhat I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,
p187
aVtherefore creating the conditions
p188
aVfor humility.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe motivational component of compassion
p191
aVcreates ambition for greater good.
p192
aVIn other words,
p193
aVcompassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.
p194
aVAnd this is the first compelling business benefit.
p195
aVThe second compelling benefit of compassion
p196
aVis that it creates an inspiring workforce.
p197
aVEmployees mutually inspire each other
p198
aVtowards greater good.
p199
aVIt creates a vibrant, energetic community
p200
aVwhere people admire and respect each other.
p201
aVI mean, you come to work in the morning,
p202
aVand you work with three guys
p203
aVwho just up and decide to build a hospital in India.
p204
aVIt's like how can you not be inspired by those people \u2014
p205
aVyour own coworkers?
p206
aVSo this mutual inspiration
p207
aVpromotes collaboration,
p208
aVinitiative and creativity.
p209
aVIt makes us a highly effective company.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo, having said all that,
p212
aVwhat is the secret formula
p213
aVfor brewing compassion
p214
aVin the corporate setting?
p215
aVIn our experience,
p216
aVthere are three ingredients.
p217
aVThe first ingredient
p218
aVis to create a culture
p219
aVof passionate concern
p220
aVfor the greater good.
p221
aVSo always think:
p222
aVhow is your company and your job
p223
aVserving the greater good?
p224
aVOr, how can you further serve
p225
aVthe greater good?
p226
aVThis awareness of serving the greater good
p227
aVis very self-inspiring
p228
aVand it creates fertile ground
p229
aVfor compassion to grow in.
p230
aVThat's one.
p231
aa(lp232
VThe second ingredient
p233
aVis autonomy.
p234
aVSo in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.
p235
aVAnd one of our most popular managers jokes that,
p236
aVthis is what he says,
p237
aV"Google is a place
p238
aVwhere the inmates run the asylum."
p239
aVAnd he considers himself one of the inmates.
p240
aVIf you already have
p241
aVa culture of compassion
p242
aVand idealism
p243
aVand you let your people roam free,
p244
aVthey will do the right thing
p245
aVin the most compassionate way.
p246
aa(lp247
VThe third ingredient
p248
aVis to focus on inner development
p249
aVand personal growth.
p250
aVLeadership training in Google, for example,
p251
aVplaces a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities,
p252
aVsuch as self-awareness, self-mastery,
p253
aVempathy and compassion,
p254
aVbecause we believe
p255
aVthat leadership begins
p256
aVwith character.
p257
aVWe even created a seven-week curriculum
p258
aVon emotion intelligence,
p259
aVwhich we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."
p260
aVIt's less naughty than it sounds.
p261
aVSo I'm an engineer by training,
p262
aVbut I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,
p263
aVwhich I find kind of funny,
p264
aVbecause this is a company that trusts an engineer
p265
aVto teach emotion intelligence.
p266
aVWhat a company.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VSo "Search Inside Yourself" \u2014 how does it work?
p271
aVIt works in three steps.
p272
aVThe first step
p273
aVis attention training.
p274
aVAttention is the basis
p275
aVof all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.
p276
aVTherefore, any curriculum
p277
aVfor training emotion intelligence
p278
aVhas to begin with attention training.
p279
aVThe idea here is to train attention
p280
aVto create a quality of mind
p281
aVthat is calm and clear
p282
aVat the same time.
p283
aVAnd this creates the foundation
p284
aVfor emotion intelligence.
p285
aVThe second step follows the first step.
p286
aa(lp287
VThe second step is developing self-knowledge
p288
aVand self-mastery.
p289
aVSo using the supercharged attention from step one,
p290
aVwe create a high-resolution perception
p291
aVinto the cognitive and emotive processes.
p292
aVWhat does that mean?
p293
aVIt means being able to observe our thought stream
p294
aVand the process of emotion
p295
aVwith high clarity,
p296
aVobjectivity
p297
aVand from a third-person perspective.
p298
aVAnd once you can do that,
p299
aVyou create the kind of self-knowledge
p300
aVthat enables self-mastery.
p301
aa(lp302
VThe third step, following the second step,
p303
aVis to create new mental habits.
p304
aVWhat does that mean? Imagine this.
p305
aVImagine whenever you meet any other person,
p306
aVany time you meet a person,
p307
aVyour habitual, instinctive first thought
p308
aVis, "I want you to be happy.
p309
aVI want you to be happy."
p310
aVImagine you can do that.
p311
aVHaving this habit, this mental habit,
p312
aVchanges everything at work.
p313
aVBecause this good will
p314
aVis unconsciously picked up by other people,
p315
aVand it creates trust,
p316
aVand trust creates a lot of good working relationships.
p317
aVAnd this also creates the conditions
p318
aVfor compassion in the workplace.
p319
aVSomeday, we hope to open-source
p320
aV"Search Inside Yourself"
p321
aVso that everybody in the corporate world
p322
aVwill at least be able to use it as a reference.
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd in closing,
p325
aVI want to end the same place I started,
p326
aVwith happiness.
p327
aVI want to quote this guy \u2014 the guy in robes, not the other guy \u2014
p328
aVthe Dalai Lama,
p329
aVwho said, "If you want others to be happy,
p330
aVpractice compassion.
p331
aVIf you want to be happy,
p332
aVpractice compassion."
p333
aVI found this to be true,
p334
aVboth on the individual level
p335
aVand at a corporate level.
p336
aVAnd I hope that compassion
p337
aVwill be both fun and profitable for you too.
p338
aa(lp339
VThank you.

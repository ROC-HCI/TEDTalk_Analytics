VGood morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic
p5
aVbeing here over these past few days.
p6
aVAnd secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up
p7
aVthis extraordinary gathering of people,
p8
aVthese amazing talks that we've had.
p9
aVI feel that I've fitted in, in many ways,
p10
aVto some of the things that I've heard.
p11
aVI came directly here
p12
aVfrom the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador,
p13
aVwhere I was out \u2014 you could only get there by a plane \u2014
p14
aVwith indigenous people with paint on their faces
p15
aVand parrot feathers on their headdresses,
p16
aVwhere these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies,
p17
aVand keep the roads, out of their forests.
p18
aVThey're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest
p19
aVin a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated,
p20
aVa world that isn't polluted.
p21
aVAnd what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in
p22
aVwith what we're all talking about here at TED,
p23
aVis that there, right in the middle of this rainforest,
p24
aVwas some solar panels \u2014 the first in that part of Ecuador \u2014
p25
aVand that was mainly to bring water up by pump
p26
aVso that the women wouldn't have to go down.
p27
aVThe water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries,
p28
aVthey were able to store a lot of electricity.
p29
aVSo every house \u2014 and there were, I think, eight houses
p30
aVin this little community \u2014 could have light
p31
aVfor, I think it was about half an hour each evening.
p32
aVAnd there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVAnd this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back,
p35
aVand he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into
p36
aVa whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man
p37
aV50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers,
p38
aVand there are some things we want to learn from the modern world.
p39
aVWe want to know about health care.
p40
aVWe want to know about what other people do \u2014 we're interested in it.
p41
aVAnd we want to learn other languages.
p42
aVWe want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese,
p43
aVand we're good at languages."
p44
aVSo there he is with his little laptop computer,
p45
aVbut fighting against the might of the pressures \u2014
p46
aVbecause of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador \u2014
p47
aVfighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course
p48
aVthe people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil.
p49
aVAnd so, coming directly from there to here.
p50
aVBut, of course, my real field of expertise
p51
aVlies in an even different kind of civilization \u2014
p52
aVI can't really call it a civilization.
p53
aVA different way of life, a different being.
p54
aVWe've talked earlier \u2014 this wonderful talk by Wade Davis
p55
aVabout the different cultures of the humans around the world \u2014
p56
aVbut the world is not composed only of human beings;
p57
aVthere are also other animal beings.
p58
aVAnd I propose to bring into this TED conference,
p59
aVas I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.
p60
aVToo often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film,
p61
aVbut these beings have voices that mean something.
p62
aVAnd so, I want to give you a greeting,
p63
aVas from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania \u2014
p64
aVOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
p65
aV(Applause)
p66
aVI've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960.
p67
aVDuring that time, there have been modern technologies
p68
aVthat have really transformed the way
p69
aVthat field biologists do their work.
p70
aVFor example, for the first time, a few years ago,
p71
aVby simply collecting little fecal samples
p72
aVwe were able to have them analyzed \u2014 to have DNA profiling done \u2014
p73
aVso for the first time, we actually know which male chimps
p74
aVare the fathers of each individual infant.
p75
aVBecause the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society.
p76
aVSo this opens up a whole new avenue of research.
p77
aVAnd we use GSI \u2014 geographic whatever it is, GSI \u2014
p78
aVto determine the range of the chimps.
p79
aVAnd we're using \u2014 you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff \u2014
p80
aVbut we're using satellite imagery
p81
aVto look at the deforestation in the area.
p82
aVAnd of course, there's developments in infrared,
p83
aVso you can watch animals at night,
p84
aVand equipment for recording by video,
p85
aVand tape recording is getting lighter and better.
p86
aVSo in many, many ways, we can do things today
p87
aVthat we couldn't do when I began in 1960.
p88
aVEspecially when chimpanzees, and other animals
p89
aVwith large brains, are studied in captivity,
p90
aVmodern technology is helping us to search
p91
aVfor the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.
p92
aVSo that we know today, they're capable of performances
p93
aVthat would have been thought absolutely impossible
p94
aVby science when I began.
p95
aVI think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled
p96
aVin intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan \u2014
p97
aVher name means love \u2014
p98
aVand she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her.
p99
aVShe loves her computer \u2014
p100
aVshe'll leave her big group, and her running water,
p101
aVand her trees and everything.
p102
aVAnd she'll come in to sit at this computer \u2014
p103
aVit's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked.
p104
aVShe's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen
p105
aVand a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans.
p106
aVShe does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them,
p107
aVbut the amazing thing about this female is
p108
aVshe doesn't like making mistakes.
p109
aVIf she has a bad run, and her score isn't good,
p110
aVshe'll come and reach up and tap on the glass \u2014
p111
aVbecause she can't see the experimenter \u2014
p112
aVwhich is asking to have another go.
p113
aVAnd her concentration \u2014 she's already concentrated hard
p114
aVfor 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again,
p115
aVjust for the satisfaction of having done it better.
p116
aVAnd the food is not important \u2014 she does get a tiny reward,
p117
aVlike one raisin for a correct response \u2014
p118
aVbut she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.
p119
aVSo here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer.
p120
aVChimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language.
p121
aVBut the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 \u2014
p122
aVI remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday \u2014
p123
aVthe first time, when I was going through the vegetation,
p124
aVthe chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part,
p125
aValthough some were a little bit acclimatized \u2014
p126
aVand I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound,
p127
aVand I peered with my binoculars.
p128
aVIt was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard \u2014
p129
aVand by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps;
p130
aVthey should all have numbers; that was more scientific.
p131
aVAnyway, David Greybeard \u2014 and I saw that
p132
aVhe was picking little pieces of grass and using them
p133
aVto fish termites from their underground nest.
p134
aVAnd not only that \u2014 he would sometimes pick a leafy twig
p135
aVand strip the leaves \u2014
p136
aVmodifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose \u2014
p137
aVthe beginning of tool-making.
p138
aVThe reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough
p139
aVis at that time, it was thought that humans,
p140
aVand only humans, used and made tools.
p141
aVWhen I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.
p142
aVSo that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news,
p143
aVhe said, "Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,'
p144
aVor accept chimpanzees as humans."
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVWe now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways
p147
aVin which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.
p148
aVMoreover, we know that in different parts of Africa,
p149
aVwherever chimps have been studied,
p150
aVthere are completely different tool-using behaviors.
p151
aVAnd because it seems that these patterns are passed
p152
aVfrom one generation to the next, through observation,
p153
aVimitation and practice \u2014 that is a definition of human culture.
p154
aVWhat we find is that over these 40-odd years
p155
aVthat I and others have been studying chimpanzees
p156
aVand the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals
p157
aVwith complex brains and social systems,
p158
aVwe have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line
p159
aVdividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.
p160
aVIt's a very wuzzy line.
p161
aVIt's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things
p162
aVthat we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.
p163
aVThe chimps \u2014 there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives \u2014
p164
aVbut they have this long childhood, five years
p165
aVof suckling and sleeping with the mother,
p166
aVand then another three, four or five years
p167
aVof emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born.
p168
aVThe importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible \u2014
p169
aVand there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society.
p170
aVThe long-term affectionate supportive bonds
p171
aVthat develop throughout this long childhood with the mother,
p172
aVwith the brothers and sisters,
p173
aVand which can last through a lifetime,
p174
aVwhich may be up to 60 years.
p175
aVThey can actually live longer than 60 in captivity,
p176
aVso we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.
p177
aVAnd we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism.
p178
aVWe find in their non-verbal communication \u2014 this is very rich \u2014
p179
aVthey have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances,
p180
aVbut they also use touch, posture, gesture,
p181
aVand what do they do?
p182
aVThey kiss; they embrace; they hold hands.
p183
aVThey pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist \u2014
p184
aVthe kind of things that we do,
p185
aVand they do them in the same kind of context.
p186
aVThey have very sophisticated cooperation.
p187
aVSometimes they hunt \u2014 not that often,
p188
aVbut when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation,
p189
aVand they share the prey.
p190
aVWe find that they show emotions, similar to \u2014 maybe sometimes the same \u2014
p191
aVas those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair.
p192
aVThey know mental as well as physical suffering.
p193
aVAnd I don't have time to go into the information
p194
aVthat will prove some of these things to you,
p195
aVsave to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities,
p196
aVstudying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals.
p197
aVWe know that chimpanzees and some other creatures
p198
aVcan recognize themselves in mirrors \u2014 "self" as opposed to "other."
p199
aVThey have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things
p200
aVwhich traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.
p201
aVBut this teaches us a new respect \u2014 and it's a new respect
p202
aVnot only for the chimpanzees, I suggest,
p203
aVbut some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.
p204
aVOnce we're prepared to admit that after all,
p205
aVwe're not the only beings with personalities, minds
p206
aVand above all feelings, and then we start to think
p207
aVabout ways we use and abuse
p208
aVso many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet,
p209
aVit really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me.
p210
aVSo, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees \u2014
p211
aVwho've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility \u2014
p212
aVare in the wild, disappearing very fast.
p213
aVThey're disappearing for the reasons
p214
aVthat all of you in this room know only too well.
p215
aVThe deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.
p216
aVThey're disappearing because some timber companies
p217
aVgo in with clear-cutting.
p218
aVThey're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa
p219
aVbecause the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads \u2014
p220
aVas they want to do in Ecuador
p221
aVand other parts where the forests remain untouched \u2014
p222
aVto take out oil or timber.
p223
aVAnd this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world,
p224
aVto what is known as the bush-meat trade.
p225
aVThis means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years,
p226
aVpeople have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is,
p227
aVin harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need
p228
aVfor themselves and their families \u2014
p229
aVnow, suddenly, because of the roads,
p230
aVthe hunters can go in from the towns.
p231
aVThey shoot everything, every single thing that moves
p232
aVthat's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.
p233
aVAnd now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks
p234
aVor the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.
p235
aVAnd people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called,
p236
aVthan for domestic meat \u2014 it's culturally preferred.
p237
aVAnd it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest
p238
aVare now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin
p239
aVwho've lived there with their wonderful way of living
p240
aVfor so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.
p241
aVThey're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.
p242
aVTheir culture is being destroyed,
p243
aValong with the animals upon whom they depend.
p244
aVSo, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.
p245
aVWe talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity,
p246
aVand I've seen it happening with my own eyes.
p247
aVAnd the grim picture in Africa \u2014 I love Africa,
p248
aVand what do we see in Africa?
p249
aVWe see deforestation;
p250
aVwe see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger;
p251
aVwe see disease and we see population growth in areas
p252
aVwhere there are more people living on a certain piece of land
p253
aVthan the land can possibly support,
p254
aVand they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere.
p255
aVWere the people that we heard about yesterday,
p256
aVon the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree \u2014 were they stupid?
p257
aVDidn't they know what was happening?
p258
aVOf course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty
p259
aVin some of these parts of the world
p260
aVit isn't a question of "Let's leave the tree for tomorrow."
p261
aV"How am I going to feed my family today?
p262
aVMaybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree
p263
aVwhich will keep us going a little bit longer,
p264
aVand then we'll pray that something will happen
p265
aVto save us from the inevitable end."
p266
aVSo, this is a pretty grim picture.
p267
aVThe one thing we have, which makes us so different
p268
aVfrom chimpanzees or other living creatures,
p269
aVis this sophisticated spoken language \u2014
p270
aVa language with which we can tell children
p271
aVabout things that aren't here.
p272
aVWe can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future,
p273
aVdiscuss ideas with each other,
p274
aVso that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.
p275
aVWe can do it by talking to each other;
p276
aVwe can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.
p277
aVAnd we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards,
p278
aVand we're destroying the world.
p279
aVIn the developed world, in a way, it's worse,
p280
aVbecause we have so much access to knowledge
p281
aVof the stupidity of what we're doing.
p282
aVDo you know, we're bringing little babies
p283
aVinto a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?
p284
aVAnd the air is harming them, and the food that's grown
p285
aVfrom the contaminated land is poisoning them.
p286
aVAnd that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.
p287
aVDo you know we all have about 50 chemicals
p288
aVin our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?
p289
aVAnd so many of these diseases, like asthma
p290
aVand certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase
p291
aVaround places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped.
p292
aVWe're harming ourselves around the world,
p293
aVas well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself \u2014
p294
aVMother Nature, that brought us into being;
p295
aVMother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time,
p296
aVwhere there's trees and flowers and birds
p297
aVfor our good psychological development.
p298
aVAnd yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children
p299
aVin the developed world who never see nature,
p300
aVbecause they're growing up in concrete
p301
aVand all they know is virtual reality,
p302
aVwith no opportunity to go and lie in the sun,
p303
aVor in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks
p304
aVcoming down from the canopy above.
p305
aVAs I was traveling around the world, you know,
p306
aVI had to leave the forest \u2014 that's where I love to be.
p307
aVI had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees
p308
aVfor my students and field staff to continue studying
p309
aVbecause, finding they dwindled from about two million
p310
aV100 years ago to about 150,000 now,
p311
aVI knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could
p312
aVto raise awareness around the world.
p313
aVAnd the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight,
p314
aVthe more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected,
p315
aVand the problems of the developing world
p316
aVso often stem from the greed of the developed world,
p317
aVand everything was joining together, and making \u2014 not sense,
p318
aVhope lies in sense, you said \u2014 it's making a nonsense.
p319
aVHow can we do it?
p320
aVSomebody said that yesterday.
p321
aVAnd as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.
p322
aVThey were feeling despair,
p323
aVthey were feeling, "Well, it doesn't matter what we do;
p324
aVeat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
p325
aVEverything is hopeless \u2014 we're always being told so by the media."
p326
aVAnd then I met some who were angry,
p327
aVand anger that can turn to violence,
p328
aVand we're all familiar with that.
p329
aVAnd I have three little grandchildren,
p330
aVand when some of these students would say to me
p331
aVat high school or university, they'd say, "We're angry,"
p332
aVor "We're filled with despair, because we feel
p333
aVyou've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it."
p334
aVAnd I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren,
p335
aVand think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.
p336
aVI feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania,
p337
aVI started a program that's called Roots and Shoots.
p338
aVThere's little brochures all around outside,
p339
aVand if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future,
p340
aVI beg that you pick up that brochure.
p341
aVAnd Roots and Shoots is a program for hope.
p342
aVRoots make a firm foundation.
p343
aVShoots seem tiny,
p344
aVbut to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.
p345
aVSee the brick walls as all the problems
p346
aVthat we've inflicted on this planet.
p347
aVThen, you see, it is a message of hope.
p348
aVHundreds and thousands of young people around the world
p349
aVcan break through, and can make this a better world.
p350
aVAnd the most important message of Roots and Shoots
p351
aVis that every single individual makes a difference.
p352
aVEvery individual has a role to play.
p353
aVEvery one of us impacts the world around us everyday,
p354
aVand you scientists know that you can't actually \u2014
p355
aVeven if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen
p356
aVand giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo,
p357
aVand things like that \u2014
p358
aVyou're making a difference in the world.
p359
aVSo, the Roots and Shoots program
p360
aVinvolves youth in three kinds of projects.
p361
aVAnd these are projects to make the world around them a better place.
p362
aVOne project to show care and concern for your own human community.
p363
aVOne for animals, including domestic animals \u2014 and I have to say,
p364
aVI learned everything I know about animal behavior
p365
aVeven before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty,
p366
aVwho was my childhood companion.
p367
aVAnd the third kind of project: something for the local environment.
p368
aVSo what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they \u2014
p369
aVand we go now from pre-school right through university.
p370
aVIt's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.
p371
aVIt's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished.
p372
aVIt's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.
p373
aVWe're in every state now, and the problems in Florida
p374
aVare different from the problems in New York.
p375
aVIt's going to depend on which country they're in \u2014
p376
aVand we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups \u2014
p377
aVand there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about
p378
aVthat I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program
p379
aVand spreading it themselves.
p380
aVWhy?
p381
aVBecause they're buying into it,
p382
aVand they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.
p383
aVIt isn't something that their parents tell them,
p384
aVor their teachers tell them.
p385
aVThat's effective, but if they decide themselves,
p386
aV"We want to clean this river
p387
aVand put the fish back that used to be there.
p388
aVWe want to clear away the toxic soil
p389
aVfrom this area and have an organic garden.
p390
aVWe want to go and spend time with the old people
p391
aVand hear their stories and record their oral histories.
p392
aVWe want to go and work in a dog shelter.
p393
aVWe want to learn about animals. We want ... "
p394
aVYou know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.
p395
aVAs I travel around the world 300 days a year,
p396
aVeverywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.
p397
aVEverywhere there are children with shining eyes saying,
p398
aV"Look at the difference we've made."
p399
aVAnd now comes the technology into it,
p400
aVbecause with this new way of communicating electronically
p401
aVthese kids can communicate with each other around the world.
p402
aVAnd if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas
p403
aVbut we need help \u2014 we need help to create the right kind of system
p404
aVthat will help these young people to communicate their excitement.
p405
aVBut also \u2014 and this is so important \u2014 to communicate their despair,
p406
aVto say, "We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?"
p407
aVAnd then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids
p408
aVwho may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel,
p409
aVsaying, "Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it."
p410
aVThe philosophy is very simple.
p411
aVWe do not believe in violence.
p412
aVNo violence, no bombs, no guns.
p413
aVThat's not the way to solve problems.
p414
aVViolence leads to violence, at least in my view.
p415
aVSo how do we solve?
p416
aVThe tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding.
p417
aVKnow the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.
p418
aVHard work and persistence \u2014don't give up \u2014
p419
aVand love and compassion leading to respect for all life.
p420
aVHow many more minutes? Two, one?
p421
aVChris Anderson: One \u2014 one to two.
p422
aVJane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.
p423
aV(Laughter)
p424
aVAre you going to come and drag me off?
p425
aV(Laughter)
p426
aVAnyway \u2014 so basically, Roots and Shoots
p427
aVis beginning to change young people's lives.
p428
aVIt's what I'm devoting most of my energy to.
p429
aVAnd I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact,
p430
aVnot just because you can share technology with us,
p431
aVbut because so many of you have children.
p432
aVAnd if you take this program out, and give it to your children,
p433
aVthey have such a good opportunity to go out and do good,
p434
aVbecause they've got parents like you.
p435
aVAnd it's been so clear how much you all care
p436
aVabout trying to make this world a better place.
p437
aVIt's very encouraging.
p438
aVBut the kids do ask me \u2014
p439
aVand this won't take more than two minutes, I promise \u2014
p440
aVthe kids say, "Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future?
p441
aVYou travel, you see all these horrible things happening."
p442
aVFirstly, the human brain \u2014 I don't need to say anything about that.
p443
aVNow that we know what the problems are around the world,
p444
aVhuman brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.
p445
aVAnd we've talked a lot about that.
p446
aVSecondly, the resilience of nature.
p447
aVWe can destroy a river,
p448
aVand we can bring it back to life.
p449
aVWe can see a whole area desolated,
p450
aVand it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.
p451
aVAnd thirdly, the last speaker talked about \u2014 or the speaker before last,
p452
aVtalked about the indomitable human spirit.
p453
aVWe are surrounded by the most amazing people
p454
aVwho do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.
p455
aVNelson Mandela \u2014 I take a little piece of limestone
p456
aVfrom Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years,
p457
aVand came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people
p458
aVfrom the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath.
p459
aVEven after the 11th of September \u2014 and I was in New York
p460
aVand I felt the fear \u2014 nevertheless, there was so much human courage,
p461
aVso much love and so much compassion.
p462
aVAnd then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear \u2014
p463
aVthe fear that was leading to people feeling
p464
aVthey couldn't worry about the environment any more,
p465
aVin case they seemed not to be patriotic \u2014
p466
aVand I was trying to encourage them,
p467
aVsomebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi,
p468
aV"If you look back through human history,
p469
aVyou see that every evil regime has been overcome by good."
p470
aVAnd just after that a woman brought me this little bell,
p471
aVand I want to end on this note.
p472
aVShe said, "If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this.
p473
aVThis bell is made from metal from a defused landmine,
p474
aVfrom the killing fields of Pol Pot \u2014
p475
aVone of the most evil regimes in human history \u2014
p476
aVwhere people are now beginning to put their lives back together
p477
aVafter the regime has crumbled.
p478
aVSo, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?
p479
aVIs it out there with the politicians?
p480
aVIt's in our hands.
p481
aVIt's in your hands and my hands
p482
aVand those of our children.
p483
aVIt's really up to us.
p484
aVWe're the ones who can make a difference.
p485
aVIf we lead lives where we consciously leave
p486
aVthe lightest possible ecological footprints,
p487
aVif we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy
p488
aVand don't buy the things that are not,
p489
aVwe can change the world overnight.
p490
aVThank you.

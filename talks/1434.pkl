VAmerica's public energy conversation
p5
aVboils down to this question:
p6
aVWould you rather die of A) oil wars,
p7
aVor B) climate change,
p8
aVor C) nuclear holocaust,
p9
aVor D) all of the above?
p10
aVOh, I missed one: or E) none of the above?
p11
aVThat's the one we're not normally offered.
p12
aVWhat if we could make energy do our work
p13
aVwithout working our undoing?
p14
aVCould we have fuel without fear?
p15
aVCould we reinvent fire?
p16
aa(lp17
VYou see, fire made us human;
p18
aVfossil fuels made us modern.
p19
aVBut now we need a new fire
p20
aVthat makes us safe, secure, healthy and durable.
p21
aVLet's see how.
p22
aa(lp23
VFour-fifths of the world's energy
p24
aVstill comes from burning each year
p25
aVfour cubic miles of the rotted remains
p26
aVof primeval swamp goo.
p27
aVThose fossil fuels
p28
aVhave built our civilization.
p29
aVThey've created our wealth.
p30
aVThey've enriched the lives of billions.
p31
aVBut they also have rising costs
p32
aVto our security, economy, health and environment
p33
aVthat are starting to erode, if not outweigh their benefits.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo we need a new fire.
p36
aVAnd switching from the old fire to the new fire
p37
aVmeans changing two big stories about oil and electricity,
p38
aVeach of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air.
p39
aVBut they're really quite distinct.
p40
aa(lp41
VLess than one percent of our electricity is made from oil \u2014
p42
aValthough almost half is made from coal.
p43
aVTheir uses are quite concentrated.
p44
aVThree-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation.
p45
aVThree-fourths of our electricity powers buildings.
p46
aVAnd the rest of both runs factories.
p47
aVSo very efficient vehicles, buildings and factories
p48
aVsave oil and coal,
p49
aVand also natural gas that can displace both of them.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut today's energy system is not just inefficient,
p52
aVit is also disconnected,
p53
aVaging, dirty and insecure.
p54
aVSo it needs refurbishment.
p55
aVBy 2050 though, it could become efficient,
p56
aVconnected and distributed
p57
aVwith elegantly frugal
p58
aVautos, factories and buildings
p59
aVall relying on a modern, secure
p60
aVand resilient electricity system.
p61
aa(lp62
VWe can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050
p63
aVand use one-third less natural gas
p64
aVwhile switching to efficient use
p65
aVand renewable supply.
p66
aVThis could cost, by 2050,
p67
aVfive trillion dollars less in net present value,
p68
aVthat is expressed as a lump sum today,
p69
aVthan business as usual \u2014
p70
aVassuming that carbon emissions
p71
aVand all other hidden or external costs are worth zero \u2014
p72
aVa conservatively low estimate.
p73
aVYet this cheaper energy system
p74
aVcould support 158 percent bigger U.S. economy
p75
aVall without needing oil or coal,
p76
aVor for that matter nuclear energy.
p77
aVMoreover, this transition needs no new inventions
p78
aVand no acts of Congress
p79
aVand no new federal taxes, mandate subsidies or laws
p80
aVand running Washington gridlock.
p81
aa(lp82
VLet me say that again.
p83
aVI'm going to tell you how to get the United States
p84
aVcompletely off oil and coal, five trillion dollars cheaper
p85
aVwith no act of Congress
p86
aVled by business for profit.
p87
aVIn other words, we're going to use our most effective institutions \u2014
p88
aVprivate enterprise co-evolving with civil society
p89
aVand sped by military innovation
p90
aVto go around our least effective institutions.
p91
aVAnd whether you care most
p92
aVabout profits and jobs and competitive advantage
p93
aVor national security, or environmental stewardship
p94
aVand climate protection and public health,
p95
aVreinventing fire makes sense and makes money.
p96
aa(lp97
VGeneral Eisenhower reputedly said
p98
aVthat enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem
p99
aVmakes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies.
p100
aVSo in reinventing fire,
p101
aVwe integrated all four sectors that use energy \u2014
p102
aVtransportation, buildings, industry and electricity \u2014
p103
aVand we integrated four kinds of innovation,
p104
aVnot just technology and policy,
p105
aVbut also design and business strategy.
p106
aVThose combinations yield
p107
aVvery much more than the sum of the parts,
p108
aVespecially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities.
p109
aa(lp110
VOil costs our economy two billion dollars a day,
p111
aVplus another four billion dollars a day
p112
aVin hidden economic and military costs,
p113
aVraising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP.
p114
aVOur mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles.
p115
aVSo let's start by making autos oil free.
p116
aVTwo-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car
p117
aVis caused by its weight.
p118
aVAnd every unit of energy you save at the wheels,
p119
aVby taking out weight or drag,
p120
aVsaves seven units in the tank,
p121
aVbecause you don't have to waste six units
p122
aVgetting the energy to the wheels.
p123
aa(lp124
VUnfortunately, over the past quarter century,
p125
aVepidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars
p126
aVgain weight twice as fast as we have.
p127
aVBut today, ultralight, ultrastrong materials,
p128
aVlike carbon fiber composites,
p129
aVcan make dramatic weight savings snowball
p130
aVand can make cars simpler and cheaper to build.
p131
aVLighter and more slippery autos
p132
aVneed less force to move them,
p133
aVso their engines get smaller.
p134
aVIndeed, that sort of vehicle fitness
p135
aVthen makes electric propulsion affordable
p136
aVbecause the batteries or fuel cells
p137
aValso get smaller and lighter and cheaper.
p138
aVSo sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today,
p139
aVwhile the driving cost, even from the start,
p140
aVis very much lower.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo these innovations together can transform automakers
p143
aVfrom wringing tiny savings
p144
aVout of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies
p145
aVto the steeply falling costs
p146
aVof three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other \u2014
p147
aVnamely ultralight materials, making them into structures
p148
aVand electric propulsion.
p149
aVThe sales can grow and the prices fall even faster
p150
aVwith temporary feebates,
p151
aVthat is rebates for efficient new autos
p152
aVpaid for by fees on inefficient ones.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd just in the first two years
p155
aVthe biggest of Europe's five feebate programs
p156
aVhas tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency.
p157
aVThe resulting shift to electric autos
p158
aVis going to be as game-changing
p159
aVas shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers.
p160
aVOf course, computers and electronics
p161
aVare now America's biggest industry,
p162
aVwhile typewriter makers have vanished.
p163
aVSo vehicle fitness
p164
aVopens a new automotive competitive strategy
p165
aVthat can double the oil savings over the next 40 years,
p166
aVbut then also make electrification affordable,
p167
aVand that displaces the rest of the oil.
p168
aa(lp169
VAmerica could lead this next automotive revolution.
p170
aVCurrently the leader is Germany.
p171
aVLast year, Volkswagen announced
p172
aVthat by next year they'll be producing
p173
aVthis carbon fiber plugin hybrid
p174
aVgetting 230 miles a gallon.
p175
aVAlso last year, BMW announced
p176
aVthis carbon fiber electric car,
p177
aVthey said that its carbon fiber is paid for
p178
aVby needing fewer batteries.
p179
aVAnd they said, "We do not intend to be a typewriter maker."
p180
aVAudi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year.
p181
aa(lp182
VSeven years ago, an even faster and cheaper
p183
aVAmerican manufacturing technology
p184
aVwas used to make this little carbon fiber test part,
p185
aVwhich doubles as a carbon cap.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVIn one minute \u2014 and you can tell from the sound
p188
aVhow immensely stiff and strong it is.
p189
aVDon't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium.
p190
aVTom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer
p191
aVwithout even scuffing it.
p192
aa(lp193
VBut such manufacturing techniques
p194
aVcan scale to automotive speed and cost
p195
aVwith aerospace performance.
p196
aVThey can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos.
p197
aVThey can save lives
p198
aVbecause this stuff can absorb
p199
aVup to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel.
p200
aVIf we made all of our autos this way,
p201
aVit would save oil equivalent to finding
p202
aVone and a half Saudi Arabias, or half an OPEC,
p203
aVby drilling in the Detroit formation, a very prospective play.
p204
aVAnd all those mega-barrels under Detroit
p205
aVcost an average of 18 bucks a barrel.
p206
aVThey are all-American, carbon-free
p207
aVand inexhaustible.
p208
aa(lp209
VThe same physics and the same business logic
p210
aValso apply to big vehicles.
p211
aVIn the five years ending with 2010,
p212
aVWalmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile
p213
aVin its giant fleet of heavy trucks
p214
aVthrough better logistics and design.
p215
aVBut just the technological savings in heavy trucks
p216
aVcan get to two-thirds.
p217
aVAnd combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes,
p218
aVnow on the drawing board,
p219
aVcan save close to a trillion dollars.
p220
aa(lp221
VAlso today's military revolution in energy efficiency
p222
aVis going to speed up all of these civilian advances
p223
aVin much the same way that military R&D
p224
aVhas given us the Internet, the Global Positioning System
p225
aVand the jet engine and microchip industries.
p226
aVAs we design and build vehicles better,
p227
aVwe can also use them smarter
p228
aVby harnessing four powerful techniques
p229
aVfor eliminating needless driving.
p230
aVInstead of just seeing the travel grow,
p231
aVwe can use innovative pricing,
p232
aVcharging for road infrastructure by the mile, not by the gallon.
p233
aa(lp234
VWe can use some smart IT to enhance transit
p235
aVand enable car sharing and ride sharing.
p236
aVWe can allow smart and lucrative growth models
p237
aVthat help people already be near where they want to be,
p238
aVso they don't need to go somewhere else.
p239
aVAnd we can use smart IT
p240
aVto make traffic free-flowing.
p241
aVTogether, those things can give us the same or better access
p242
aVwith 46 to 84 percent less driving,
p243
aVsaving another 0.4 trillion dollars,
p244
aVplus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo 40 years hence, when you add it all up,
p247
aVa far more mobile U.S. economy
p248
aVcan use no oil.
p249
aVSaving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks
p250
aVrather than buying them for over a hundred,
p251
aVadds up to a $4 trillion net saving
p252
aVcounting all the hidden costs at zero.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo to get mobility without oil,
p255
aVto phase out the oil,
p256
aVwe can get efficient and then switch fuels.
p257
aVThose 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos
p258
aVcan use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells,
p259
aVelectricity and advanced biofuels.
p260
aVThe trucks and planes can realistically use
p261
aVhydrogen or advanced biofuels.
p262
aVThe trucks could even use natural gas.
p263
aVBut no vehicles will need oil.
p264
aVAnd the most biofuel we might need,
p265
aVjust three million barrels a day,
p266
aVcan be made two-thirds from waste
p267
aVwithout displacing any cropland
p268
aVand without harming soil or climate.
p269
aa(lp270
VOur team speeds up these kinds of oil savings
p271
aVby what we call "institutional acupuncture."
p272
aVWe figure out where the business logic
p273
aVis congested and not flowing properly,
p274
aVwe stick little needles in it to get it flowing,
p275
aVworking with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd the long transition is already well under way.
p278
aVIn fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil,
p279
aVnot in supply, but in demand.
p280
aVAnd Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016.
p281
aa(lp282
VIn other words, oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices
p283
aVbefore it becomes unavailable even at high prices.
p284
aVBut the electrified vehicles
p285
aVdon't need to burden the electricity grid.
p286
aVRather, when smart autos exchange electricity and information
p287
aVthrough smart buildings with smart grids,
p288
aVthey're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage
p289
aVthat help the grid integrate
p290
aVvarying solar and wind power.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo the electrified autos
p293
aVmake the auto and electricity problems
p294
aVeasier to solve together than separately.
p295
aVAnd they also converge the oil story
p296
aVwith our second big story,
p297
aVsaving electricity and then making it differently.
p298
aVAnd those twin revolutions in electricity
p299
aVwill bring to that sector
p300
aVmore numerous and profound and diverse disruptions
p301
aVthan any other sector,
p302
aVbecause we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on
p303
aVwith 20th and 19th century institutions, rules and cultures.
p304
aVChanging how we make electricity gets easier
p305
aVif we need less of it.
p306
aVMost of it now is wasted
p307
aVand the technologies for saving it
p308
aVkeep improving faster than we're installing them.
p309
aVSo the unbought efficiency resource
p310
aVkeeps getting ever bigger and cheaper.
p311
aa(lp312
VBut as efficiency in buildings and industry
p313
aVstarts to grow faster than the economy,
p314
aVAmerica's electricity use could actually shrink,
p315
aVeven with the little extra use required
p316
aVfor those efficient electrified autos.
p317
aVAnd we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends.
p318
aa(lp319
VOver the next 40 years, buildings,
p320
aVwhich use three-quarters of the electricity,
p321
aVcan triple or quadruple their energy productivity,
p322
aVsaving 1.4 trillion dollars, net present value,
p323
aVwith a 33 percent internal rate of return
p324
aVor in English,
p325
aVthe savings are worth four times what they cost.
p326
aVAnd industry can accelerate too,
p327
aVdoubling its energy productivity
p328
aVwith a 21 percent internal rate of return.
p329
aVThe key is a disruptive innovation
p330
aVthat we call integrative design
p331
aVthat often makes very big energy savings
p332
aVcost less than small or no savings.
p333
aVThat is, it can give you expanding returns,
p334
aVnot diminishing returns.
p335
aa(lp336
VThat is how our 2010 retrofit
p337
aVis saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building \u2014
p338
aVremanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site
p339
aVinto super windows that pass light, but reflect heat.
p340
aVplus better lights and office equipment and such
p341
aVcut the maximum cooling load by a third.
p342
aVAnd then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones
p343
aVsaved 17 million dollars of
p344
aVcapital cost, which helped pay for the other improvements
p345
aVand reduce the payback to just three years.
p346
aVIntegrative design can also increase
p347
aVenergy savings in industry.
p348
aVDow's billion-dollar efficiency investment
p349
aVhas already returned nine billion dollars.
p350
aa(lp351
VBut industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars
p352
aVof energy still to save.
p353
aVFor example, three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors.
p354
aVHalf of that runs pumps and fans.
p355
aVAnd those can all be made more efficient,
p356
aVand the motors that turn them
p357
aVcan have their system efficiency roughly doubled
p358
aVby integrating 35 improvements, paying back in about a year.
p359
aa(lp360
VBut first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savings
p361
aVthat are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks.
p362
aVFor example, pumps, the biggest use of motors,
p363
aVmove liquid through pipes.
p364
aVBut a standard industrial pumping loop
p365
aVwas redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy,
p366
aVnot by getting better pumps,
p367
aVbut just by replacing long, thin, crooked pipes
p368
aVwith fat, short, straight pipes.
p369
aVThis is not about new technology,
p370
aVit's just rearranging our metal furniture.
p371
aVOf course, it also shrinks the pumping equipment
p372
aVand its capital costs.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo what do such savings mean
p375
aVfor the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors?
p376
aVWell, from the coal burned at the power plant
p377
aVthrough all these compounding losses,
p378
aVonly a tenth of the fuel energy
p379
aVactually ends up coming out the pipe as flow.
p380
aVBut now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards,
p381
aVand every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe
p382
aVsaves 10 units of fuel cost, pollution
p383
aVand what Hunter Lovins calls "global weirding"
p384
aVback at the power plant.
p385
aVAnd of course, as you go back upstream,
p386
aVthe components get smaller and therefore cheaper.
p387
aa(lp388
VOur team has lately found such snowballing energy savings
p389
aVin more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns \u2014
p390
aVeverything from data centers and chip fabs
p391
aVto mines and refineries.
p392
aVTypically our retrofit designs
p393
aVsave about 30 to 60 percent of the energy
p394
aVand pay back in a few years,
p395
aVwhile the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent
p396
aVwith generally lower capital cost.
p397
aa(lp398
VNow needing less electricity
p399
aVwould ease and speed
p400
aVthe shift to new sources of electricity, chiefly renewables.
p401
aVChina leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost.
p402
aVIn fact, these solar power module costs
p403
aVhave just fallen off the bottom of the chart.
p404
aVAnd Germany now has more solar workers
p405
aVthan America has steel workers.
p406
aVAlready in about 20 states
p407
aVprivate installers will come
p408
aVput those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down
p409
aVand beat your utility bill.
p410
aVSuch unregulated products
p411
aVcould ultimately add up to a virtual utility
p412
aVthat bypasses your electric company
p413
aVjust as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company.
p414
aVAnd this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees
p415
aVand it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams.
p416
aa(lp417
VRenewables are no longer a fringe activity.
p418
aVFor each of the past four years
p419
aVhalf of the world's new generating capacity
p420
aVhas been renewable,
p421
aVmainly lately in developing countries.
p422
aVIn 2010, renewables other than big hydro,
p423
aVparticularly wind and solar cells,
p424
aVgot 151 billion dollars of private investment,
p425
aVand they actually surpassed the total installed capacity
p426
aVof nuclear power in the world
p427
aVby adding 60 billion watts in that one year.
p428
aVThat happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity
p429
aVthat the world can now make every year \u2014
p430
aVa number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year.
p431
aVIn contrast, the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity
p432
aVand the orders behind those keep fading
p433
aVbecause they cost too much and they have too much financial risk.
p434
aVIn fact in this country,
p435
aVno new nuclear power plant
p436
aVhas been able to raise any private construction capital,
p437
aVdespite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies.
p438
aa(lp439
VSo how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants?
p440
aVWell efficiency and gas can displace them all
p441
aVat just below their operating cost
p442
aVand, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 times
p443
aVat less than their replacement cost.
p444
aVBut we only need to replace them once.
p445
aVWe're often told though
p446
aVthat only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on,
p447
aVbecause they're 24/7,
p448
aVwhereas wind and solar power are variable,
p449
aVand hence supposedly unreliable.
p450
aa(lp451
VActually no generator is 24/7. They all break.
p452
aVAnd when a big plant goes down,
p453
aVyou lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds,
p454
aVoften for weeks or months, often without warning.
p455
aVThat is exactly why we've designed the grid
p456
aVto back up failed plants with working plants.
p457
aVAnd in exactly the same way,
p458
aVthe grid can handle wind and solar power's
p459
aVforecastable variations.
p460
aa(lp461
VHourly simulations
p462
aVshow that largely or wholly renewable grids
p463
aVcan deliver highly reliable power
p464
aVwhen they're forecasted,
p465
aVintegrated and diversified
p466
aVby both type and location.
p467
aVAnd that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe
p468
aVand for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid.
p469
aVThat is how, for example,
p470
aVfour German states in 2010
p471
aVwere 43 to 52 percent wind powered.
p472
aVPortugal was 45 percent renewable powered,
p473
aVDenmark 36.
p474
aVAnd it's how all of Europe can shift
p475
aVto renewable electricity.
p476
aVIn America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system
p477
aVhas to be replaced anyway by 2050.
p478
aVAnd whatever we replace it with
p479
aVis going to cost about the same,
p480
aVabout six trillion dollars at present value \u2014
p481
aVwhether we buy more of what we've got
p482
aVor new nuclear and so-called clean coal,
p483
aVor renewables that are more or less centralized.
p484
aa(lp485
VBut those four futures at the same cost
p486
aVdiffer profoundly in their risks,
p487
aVaround national security,
p488
aVfuel, water, finance, technology,
p489
aVclimate and health.
p490
aVFor example, our over-centralized grid
p491
aVis very vulnerable to cascading
p492
aVand potentially economy-shattering blackouts
p493
aVcaused by bad space weather or other natural disasters
p494
aVor a terrorist attack.
p495
aVBut that blackout risk disappears,
p496
aVand all of the other risks are best managed,
p497
aVwith distributed renewables
p498
aVorganized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect,
p499
aVbut can stand alone at need.
p500
aVThat is, they can disconnect fractally
p501
aVand then reconnect seamlessly.
p502
aa(lp503
VThat approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting
p504
aVfor its own power supply.
p505
aVThey think they need that; how about the rest of us that they're defending?
p506
aVWe want our stuff to work too.
p507
aVAt about the same cost as business as usual,
p508
aVthis would maximize national security,
p509
aVcustomer choice, entrepreneurial opportunity
p510
aVand innovation.
p511
aa(lp512
VTogether, efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply
p513
aVare starting to transform the whole electricity sector.
p514
aVTraditionally utilities build
p515
aVa lot of giant coal and nuclear plants
p516
aVand a bunch of big gas plants
p517
aVand maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables.
p518
aVAnd those utilities were rewarded,
p519
aVas they still are in 34 states,
p520
aVfor selling you more electricity.
p521
aVHowever, especially where regulators
p522
aVare now instead rewarding cutting your bills,
p523
aVthe investments are shifting radically
p524
aVtoward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration,
p525
aVrenewables and ways to knit them all together reliably
p526
aVwith less transmission
p527
aVand little or no bulk electricity storage.
p528
aa(lp529
VSo our energy future is not fate, but choice,
p530
aVand that choice is very flexible.
p531
aVIn 1976, for example,
p532
aVgovernment and industry insisted
p533
aVthat the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP
p534
aVcould never go down.
p535
aVAnd I heretically suggested it could go down several-fold.
p536
aVWell that's what's actually happened so far.
p537
aVIt's fallen by half.
p538
aVBut with today's much better technologies,
p539
aVmore mature delivery channels and integrative design,
p540
aVwe can do far more and even cheaper.
p541
aa(lp542
VSo to solve the energy problem,
p543
aVwe just needed to enlarge it.
p544
aVAnd the results may at first seem incredible,
p545
aVbut as Marshall McLuhan said,
p546
aV"Only puny secrets need protection.
p547
aVBig discoveries are protected by public incredulity."
p548
aVNow combine the electricity and oil revolutions,
p549
aVboth driven by modern efficiency,
p550
aVand you get the really big story: reinventing fire,
p551
aVwhere business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets
p552
aVcan lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050,
p553
aVsaving 5 trillion dollars,
p554
aVgrowing the economy 2.6-fold,
p555
aVstrengthening out national security,
p556
aVoh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal,
p557
aVreducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent.
p558
aa(lp559
VNow if you like any of those outcomes,
p560
aVyou can support reinventing fire
p561
aVwithout needing to like all of them
p562
aVand without needing to agree about which of them is most important.
p563
aVSo focusing on outcomes, not motives,
p564
aVcan turn gridlock and conflict
p565
aVinto a unifying solution to America's energy challenge.
p566
aVThis also turns out to be the best way
p567
aVto cope with global challenges \u2014
p568
aVclimate change, nuclear proliferation,
p569
aVenergy insecurity, energy poverty \u2014
p570
aVall of which make us less safe.
p571
aa(lp572
VNow our team at RMI helps smart companies
p573
aVto get unstuck and speed this journey
p574
aVvia six sectoral initiatives, with some more hatching.
p575
aVOf course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too.
p576
aVFormer oil man Maurice Strong said,
p577
aV"Not all the fossils are in the fuel."
p578
aVBut as Edgar Woolard, who used to chair Dupont, reminds us,
p579
aV"Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem
p580
aVbecause," he said," they simply won't be around long-term."
p581
aa(lp582
VI've described not just a once-in-a-civilization
p583
aVbusiness opportunity,
p584
aVbut one of the most profound transitions
p585
aVin the history of our species.
p586
aVWe humans are inventing a new fire,
p587
aVnot dug from below,
p588
aVbut flowing from above;
p589
aVnot scarce, but bountiful;
p590
aVnot local, but everywhere;
p591
aVnot transient, but permanent;
p592
aVnot costly, but free.
p593
aVAnd but for a little transitional tail of natural gas
p594
aVand a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure,
p595
aVthis new fire is flameless.
p596
aVEfficiently used, it really can do our work
p597
aVwithout working our undoing.
p598
aa(lp599
VEach of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize.
p600
aVAnd our new book "Reinventing Fire"
p601
aVdescribes how you can capture it.
p602
aVSo with the conversation just begun
p603
aVat ReinventingFire.com,
p604
aVlet me invite you each
p605
aVto engage with us and with each other, with everyone around you,
p606
aVto help make the world richer, fairer,
p607
aVcooler and safer
p608
aVby together reinventing fire.
p609
aa(lp610
VThank you.

His new book and site, <a href=\\"http://www.rmi.org/ReinventingFire\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Reinventing Fire</em></a>, offers actionable solutions for four energy-intensive sectors of the  economy: transportation, buildings, industry and electricity.

VI'm going to talk about post-conflict recovery
p5
aVand how we might do post-conflict recovery better.
p6
aVThe record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive.
p7
aV40 percent of all post-conflict situations,
p8
aVhistorically, have reverted back to conflict within a decade.
p9
aVIn fact, they've accounted for half of all civil wars.
p10
aVWhy has the record been so poor?
p11
aVWell, the conventional approach
p12
aVto post-conflict situations
p13
aVhas rested on, on kind of, three principles.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe first principle is: it's the politics that matters.
p16
aVSo, the first thing that is prioritized is politics.
p17
aVTry and build a political settlement first.
p18
aVAnd then the second step is to say,
p19
aV"The situation is admittedly dangerous, but only for a short time."
p20
aVSo get peacekeepers there, but get them home as soon as possible.
p21
aVSo, short-term peacekeepers.
p22
aVAnd thirdly, what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers?
p23
aVIt's an election.
p24
aVThat will produce a legitimate and accountable government.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo that's the conventional approach.
p27
aVI think that approach denies reality.
p28
aVWe see that there is no quick fix.
p29
aVThere's certainly no quick security fix.
p30
aVI've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict,
p31
aVduring our post-conflict decade.
p32
aVAnd the risks stay high throughout the decade.
p33
aVAnd they stay high regardless of the political innovations.
p34
aVDoes an election produce an accountable and legitimate government?
p35
aVWhat an election produces is a winner and a loser.
p36
aVAnd the loser is unreconciled.
p37
aVThe reality is that we need to reverse the sequence.
p38
aVIt's not the politics first;
p39
aVit's actually the politics last.
p40
aVThe politics become easier as the decade progresses
p41
aVif you're building on a foundation
p42
aVof security and economic development \u2014
p43
aVthe rebuilding of prosperity.
p44
aa(lp45
VWhy does the politics get easier?
p46
aVAnd why is it so difficult initially?
p47
aVBecause after years of stagnation and decline,
p48
aVthe mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game.
p49
aVIf the reality is stagnation,
p50
aVI can only go up if you go down.
p51
aVAnd that doesn't produce a productive politics.
p52
aVAnd so the mentality has to shift from
p53
aVzero-sum to positive-sum
p54
aVbefore you can get a productive politics.
p55
aVYou can only get positive, that mental shift,
p56
aVif the reality is that prosperity is being built.
p57
aVAnd in order to build prosperity, we need security in place.
p58
aVSo that is what you get when you face reality.
p59
aVBut the objective of facing reality
p60
aVis to change reality.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd so now let me suggest
p63
aVtwo complimentary approaches
p64
aVto changing the reality of the situations.
p65
aVThe first is to recognize the interdependence
p66
aVof three key actors, who are different actors,
p67
aVand at the moment are uncoordinated.
p68
aVThe first actor is the Security Council.
p69
aVThe Security Council typically has the responsibility
p70
aVfor providing the peacekeepers
p71
aVwho build the security.
p72
aVAnd that needs to be recognized,
p73
aVfirst of all, that peacekeeping works.
p74
aVIt is a cost-effective approach.
p75
aVIt does increase security.
p76
aVBut it needs to be done long-term.
p77
aVIt needs to be a decade-long approach,
p78
aVrather than just a couple of years.
p79
aVThat's one actor, the Security Council.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe second actor, different cast of guys,
p82
aVis the donors.
p83
aVThe donors provide post-conflict aid.
p84
aVTypically in the past,
p85
aVthe donors have been interested in the first couple of years,
p86
aVand then they got bored.
p87
aVThey moved on to some other situation.
p88
aVPost-conflict economic recovery
p89
aVis a slow process.
p90
aVThere are no quick processes in economics
p91
aVexcept decline.
p92
aVYou can do that quite fast.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVSo the donors have to stick with this situation
p95
aVfor at least a decade.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd then the third key actor
p98
aVis the post-conflict government.
p99
aVAnd there are two key things it's got to do.
p100
aVOne is it's got to do economic reform,
p101
aVnot fuss about the political constitution.
p102
aVIt's got to reform economic policy.
p103
aVWhy? Because during conflict
p104
aVeconomic policy typically deteriorates.
p105
aVGovernments snatch short-term opportunities
p106
aVand, by the end of the conflict, the chickens have come home to roost.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy.
p109
aVSo there is a reform agenda, and there is an inclusion agenda.
p110
aVThe inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections.
p111
aVElections produce a loser, who is then excluded.
p112
aVSo the inclusion agenda means genuinely
p113
aVbringing people inside the tent.
p114
aVSo those three actors.
p115
aVAnd they are interdependent
p116
aVover a long term.
p117
aVIf the Security Council doesn't commit to security
p118
aVover the course of a decade,
p119
aVyou don't get the reassurance which produces private investment.
p120
aVIf you don't get the policy reform and the aid,
p121
aVyou don't get the economic recovery,
p122
aVwhich is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers.
p123
aVSo we should recognize that interdependence,
p124
aVby formal, mutual commitments.
p125
aVThe United Nations actually has a language
p126
aVfor these mutual commitments, the recognition of mutual commitments;
p127
aVit's called the language of compact.
p128
aVAnd so we need a post-conflict compact.
p129
aVThe United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts;
p130
aVit's called the Peace Building Commission.
p131
aa(lp132
VIt would be ideal to have a standard set of norms
p133
aVwhere, when we got to a post-conflict situation,
p134
aVthere was an expectation of these mutual commitments
p135
aVfrom the three parties.
p136
aVSo that's idea one:
p137
aVrecognize interdependence.
p138
aVAnd now let me turn to the second approach, which is complimentary.
p139
aVAnd that is to focus on a few critical objectives.
p140
aVTypical post-conflict situation is a zoo
p141
aVof different actors with different priorities.
p142
aVAnd indeed, unfortunately, if you navigate by needs
p143
aVyou get a very unfocused agenda,
p144
aVbecause in these situations, needs are everywhere,
p145
aVbut the capacity to implement change is very limited.
p146
aVSo we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd I want to suggest that in the typical post-conflict situation
p149
aVthree things are critical.
p150
aVOne is jobs.
p151
aVOne is improvements in basic services \u2014
p152
aVespecially health, which is a disaster during conflict.
p153
aVSo jobs, health, and clean government.
p154
aVThose are the three critical priorities.
p155
aVSo I'm going to talk a little about each of them.
p156
aa(lp157
VJobs.
p158
aVWhat is a distinctive approach
p159
aVto generating jobs in post-conflict situations?
p160
aVAnd why are jobs so important?
p161
aVJobs for whom? Especially jobs for young men.
p162
aVIn post-conflict situations,
p163
aVthe reason that they so often revert to conflict,
p164
aVis not because elderly women get upset.
p165
aVIt's because young men get upset.
p166
aVAnd why are they upset? Because they have nothing to do.
p167
aVAnd so we need a process of generating jobs,
p168
aVfor ordinary young men, fast.
p169
aVNow, that is difficult.
p170
aVGovernments in post-conflict situation
p171
aVoften respond by puffing up the civil service.
p172
aVThat is not a good idea.
p173
aVIt's not sustainable.
p174
aVIn fact, you're building a long-term liability
p175
aVby inflating civil service.
p176
aVBut getting the private sector to expand is also difficult,
p177
aVbecause any activity which is open to international trade
p178
aVis basically going to be uncompetitive
p179
aVin a post-conflict situation.
p180
aVThese are not environments where you can build export manufacturing.
p181
aa(lp182
VThere's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade,
p183
aVand which can generate a lot of jobs,
p184
aVand which is, in any case, a sensible sector
p185
aVto expand, post-conflict,
p186
aVand that is the construction sector.
p187
aVThe construction sector has a vital role,
p188
aVobviously, in reconstruction.
p189
aVBut typically that sector has withered away during conflict.
p190
aVDuring conflict people are doing destruction.
p191
aVThere isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away.
p192
aVAnd then when you try and expand it,
p193
aVbecause it's shriveled away,
p194
aVyou encounter a lot of bottlenecks.
p195
aVBasically, prices soar
p196
aVand crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector,
p197
aVbut it doesn't generate any jobs.
p198
aVAnd so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks
p199
aVin expanding the construction sector.
p200
aa(lp201
VWhat might the bottlenecks be?
p202
aVJust think what you have to do
p203
aVsuccessfully to build a structure, using a lot of labor.
p204
aVFirst you need access to land.
p205
aVOften the legal system is broken down
p206
aVso you can't even get access to land.
p207
aVSecondly you need skills,
p208
aVthe mundane skills of the construction sector.
p209
aVIn post-conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders,
p210
aVwe need Bricklayers Without Borders,
p211
aVto rebuild the skill set.
p212
aVWe need firms. The firms have gone away.
p213
aVSo we need to encourage the growth of local firms.
p214
aVIf we do that, we not only get the jobs,
p215
aVwe get the improvements in public infrastructure,
p216
aVthe restoration of public infrastructure.
p217
aa(lp218
VLet me turn from jobs to the second objective,
p219
aVwhich is improving basic social services.
p220
aVAnd to date, there has been a sort of a schizophrenia
p221
aVin the donor community,
p222
aVas to how to build basic services
p223
aVin post-conflict sectors.
p224
aVOn the one hand it pays lip service
p225
aVto the idea of rebuild an effective state
p226
aVin the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s.
p227
aVLets develop line ministries of this, that, and the other,
p228
aVthat deliver these services.
p229
aVAnd it's schizophrenic because in their hearts
p230
aVdonors know that's not a realistic agenda,
p231
aVand so what they also do is the total bypass:
p232
aVjust fund NGOs.
p233
aa(lp234
VNeither of those approaches is sensible.
p235
aVAnd so what I'd suggest
p236
aVis what I call Independent Service Authorities.
p237
aVIt's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three.
p238
aVThe planning function and policy function stays with the ministry;
p239
aVthe delivery of services on the ground,
p240
aVyou should use whatever works \u2014
p241
aVchurches, NGOs, local communities,
p242
aVwhatever works.
p243
aVAnd in between, there should be a public agency,
p244
aVthe Independent Service Authority,
p245
aVwhich channels public money,
p246
aVand especially donor money,
p247
aVto the retail providers.
p248
aVSo the NGOs become part of a public government system,
p249
aVrather than independent of it.
p250
aa(lp251
VOne advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently.
p252
aVAnother is, you can make NGOs accountable.
p253
aVYou can use yardstick competition,
p254
aVso they have to compete against each other
p255
aVfor the resources.
p256
aVThe good NGOs, like Oxfam, are very keen on this idea.
p257
aVThey want to have the discipline and accountability.
p258
aVSo that's a way to get basic services scaled up.
p259
aVAnd because the government would be funding it,
p260
aVit would be co-branding these services.
p261
aVSo they wouldn't be provided thanks to
p262
aVthe United States government and some NGO.
p263
aVThey would be co-branded
p264
aVas being done by the post-conflict government, in the country.
p265
aVSo, jobs, basic services, finally, clean government.
p266
aa(lp267
VClean means follow their money.
p268
aVThe typical post-conflict government is so short of money
p269
aVthat it needs our money
p270
aVjust to be on a life-support system.
p271
aVYou can't get the basic functions of the state done
p272
aVunless we put money into the core budget of these countries.
p273
aVBut, if we put money into the core budget,
p274
aVwe know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity
p275
aVthat mean that money will be well spent.
p276
aVAnd if all we do is put money in and close our eyes
p277
aVit's not just that the money is wasted \u2014
p278
aVthat's the least of the problems \u2014
p279
aVit's that the money is captured.
p280
aVIt's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem.
p281
aVAnd so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo building clean government means, yes, provide money
p284
aVto the budget,
p285
aVbut also provide a lot of scrutiny,
p286
aVwhich means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money.
p287
aVPaddy Ashdown, who was the grand high nabob of Bosnia
p288
aVto the United Nations,
p289
aVin his book about his experience, he said,
p290
aV"I realize what I needed
p291
aVwas accountants without borders,
p292
aVto follow that money."
p293
aVSo that's the \u2014 let me wrap up,
p294
aVthis is the package.
p295
aa(lp296
VWhat's the goal?
p297
aVIf we follow this, what would we hope to achieve?
p298
aVThat after 10 years,
p299
aVthe focus on the construction sector
p300
aVwould have produced both jobs
p301
aVand, hence, security \u2014
p302
aVbecause young people would have jobs \u2014
p303
aVand it would have reconstructed the infrastructure.
p304
aVSo that's the focus on the construction sector.
p305
aVThe focus on the basic service delivery
p306
aVthrough these independent service authorities
p307
aVwould have rescued basic services
p308
aVfrom their catastrophic levels,
p309
aVand it would have given ordinary people
p310
aVthe sense that the government was doing something useful.
p311
aVThe emphasis on clean government
p312
aVwould have gradually squeezed out the political crooks,
p313
aVbecause there wouldn't be any money
p314
aVin taking part in the politics.
p315
aVAnd so gradually the selection,
p316
aVthe composition of politicians,
p317
aVwould shift from the crooked to the honest.
p318
aVWhere would that leave us?
p319
aVGradually it would shift
p320
aVfrom a politics of plunder
p321
aVto a politics of hope. Thank you.

VSergey Brin: I want to discuss a question
p5
aVI know that's been pressing on many of your minds.
p6
aVWe spoke to you last several years ago.
p7
aVAnd before I get started today,
p8
aVsince many of you are wondering,
p9
aVI just wanted to get it out of the way.
p10
aVThe answer is boxers.
p11
aVNow I hope all of you feel better.
p12
aa(lp13
VDo you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is?
p14
aa(lp15
VAudience: Yes.
p16
aa(lp17
VSB: What is it?
p18
aa(lp19
VAudience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.
p20
aa(lp21
VSB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.
p22
aVBut this is what helped me see it.
p23
aVThis is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.
p24
aVHere it's slightly logged.
p25
aVBut here you can see around the world
p26
aVhow people are using Google.
p27
aVAnd every one of those rising dots
p28
aVrepresents probably about 20, 30 searches,
p29
aVor something like that.
p30
aVAnd they're labeled by color right now, by language.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo you can see: here we are in the U.S.,
p33
aVand they're all coming up red.
p34
aVThere we are in Monterey \u2014 hopefully I can get it right.
p35
aVYou can see that Japan is busy at night,
p36
aVright there.
p37
aVWe have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.
p38
aVThere's a lot of activity in China.
p39
aVThere's a lot of activity in India.
p40
aVThere's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.
p41
aVAnd Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,
p42
aVis going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow you can also see, if I turn this around here \u2014
p45
aVhopefully I won't shake the world too much.
p46
aVBut you can also see, there are places where there's not so much.
p47
aVAustralia, because there just aren't very many people there.
p48
aVAnd this is something that we should really work on,
p49
aVwhich is Africa, which is just a few trickles,
p50
aVbasically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.
p51
aVBut basically, what we've noticed is these queries,
p52
aVwhich come in at thousands per second,
p53
aVare available everywhere there is power.
p54
aVAnd pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.
p55
aVAnd even in Antarctica \u2014 well, at least this time of year \u2014
p56
aVwe from time to time will see a query rising up.
p57
aVAnd if we had it plotted correctly,
p58
aVI think the International Space Station would have it, too.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo this is
p61
aVsome of the challenge that we have here,
p62
aVis you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the \u2014
p63
aVthere we go.
p64
aVThis is how we have to move the bits around
p65
aVto actually get the people the answers to their questions.
p66
aVYou can see that there's a lot of data running around.
p67
aVIt has to go all over the world: through fibers,
p68
aVthrough satellites, through all kinds of connections.
p69
aVAnd it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies
p70
aVas low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.
p71
aVBut you can see also, once again \u2014 so some places are much more wired
p72
aVthan others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,
p73
aVgoing up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow what I would like to do is just to show you
p76
aVwhat one second of this activity would look like.
p77
aVAnd if we can switch to slides \u2014
p78
aVall right, here we go.
p79
aVSo this is slowed down.
p80
aVThis is what one second looks like.
p81
aVAnd this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,
p82
aVis just making sure that we can keep up
p83
aVwith this kind of traffic load.
p84
aVNow, each one of those queries
p85
aVhas an interesting life and tale of its own.
p86
aVI mean, it could be somebody's health,
p87
aVit could be somebody's career, something important to them.
p88
aVAnd it could potentially be something
p89
aVas important as tomato sauce,
p90
aVor in this case, ketchup.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo this is a query that we had \u2014
p93
aVI guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.
p94
aVYou can see that it got started right here.
p95
aVIn the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.
p96
aVBut it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.
p97
aVas it did in Spain.
p98
aVAnd then from Spain, it went to Italy,
p99
aVand then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.
p100
aVAnd so I guess the U.S. finally,
p101
aVfinally started to like it, too.
p102
aVAnd I just wanted to play it for you.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves \u2014
p105
aVhopefully that search will work.
p106
aVAs a part of \u2014
p107
aVyou know, part of what we want to do to grow our company
p108
aVis to have more searches.
p109
aVAnd what that means is we want to have
p110
aVmore people who are healthy and educated.
p111
aVMore animals, if they start doing searches as well.
p112
aVBut partly, we want to make the world a better place,
p113
aVand so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation,
p114
aVand we're in the process of setting that up.
p115
aa(lp116
VWe also have a program already called Google Grants
p117
aVthat now serves over 150 different charities around the world,
p118
aVand these are some of the charities that are on there.
p119
aVAnd it's something I'm very excited to be a part of.
p120
aVIn fact, many of the organizations that are here \u2014
p121
aVthe Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet \u2014
p122
aVand many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.
p123
aVThey run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit
p124
aVso they can let organizations know.
p125
aa(lp126
VOne of the earlier results that we got \u2014
p127
aVwe have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village
p128
aVof 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,
p129
aVand that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been
p130
aVmany, many stories that have come in,
p131
aVbecause we do have hundreds of charities in there,
p132
aVand the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.
p133
aVNow does anybody know who this is?
p134
aVA-ha!
p135
aa(lp136
VAudience: Orkut.
p137
aa(lp138
VSB: Yes! Somebody got it.
p139
aVThis is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?
p140
aVDo we have any?
p141
aVOkay, not very many people know about it.
p142
aVI'll explain it in a second.
p143
aVThis is one of our engineers.
p144
aVWe find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.
p145
aVThat's how we churn those products out.
p146
aVOrkut had a vision to create a social network.
p147
aVI know all of you are thinking, "Yet another social network."
p148
aVBut it was a dream of his, and we, basically,
p149
aVwhen people really want to do something, well, we generally let them.
p150
aVSo this is what he built.
p151
aVWe just released it in a test phase last month,
p152
aVand it's been taking off.
p153
aa(lp154
VThis is our VP of Engineering.
p155
aVYou can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.
p156
aVAnd these are all of his friends.
p157
aVSo this is how \u2014 we just deployed it \u2014
p158
aVwe just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,
p159
aVand so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.
p160
aVAnd now we've grown to over 100,000 members.
p161
aVAnd they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.
p162
aa(lp163
VYou can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here \u2014
p164
aVthough, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic \u2014
p165
aVbut it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe,
p166
aVand all the rest of the countries.
p167
aVSo it's a fun little project.
p168
aVThere are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.
p169
aVBut it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun
p170
aVand see where it goes.
p171
aVAnd \u2014
p172
aVwell, I'll leave you in suspense.
p173
aVLarry, you can explain this one.
p174
aa(lp175
VLarry Page: Thank you, Sergey.
p176
aVSo one of the things \u2014 both Sergey and I
p177
aVwent to a Montessori school,
p178
aVand I think, for some reason,
p179
aVthis has been incorporated in Google.
p180
aVAnd Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,
p181
aVyou know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,
p182
aVand we call this \u2014 at Google, we've embodied this as "the 20 percent time,"
p183
aVand the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,
p184
aVif you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.
p185
aVAnd many, many things at Google have come out of that,
p186
aVsuch as Orkut and also Google News.
p187
aVAnd I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.
p188
aVMendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,
p189
aVactually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics \u2014
p190
aVas a hobby, basically.
p191
aVSo many, many useful things come out of this.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd News, which I just mentioned,
p194
aVwas started by a researcher.
p195
aVAnd he just \u2014 he \u2014 after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.
p196
aVAnd he said, "Why don't I look at the news better?"
p197
aVAnd so he started clustering it by category,
p198
aVand then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.
p199
aVAnd then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,
p200
aVwe made it a Googlette,
p201
aVwhich is basically a small project at Google.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo it'd be like three people, or something like that,
p204
aVand they would try to make a product.
p205
aVAnd we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.
p206
aVAnd in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people
p207
aVworking on it for a while, and then more and more people
p208
aVstarted using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,
p209
aVand more and more people started using it.
p210
aVAnd now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.
p211
aVAnd this is how we keep our innovation running.
p212
aa(lp213
VI think usually, as companies get bigger,
p214
aVthey find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.
p215
aVAnd we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,
p216
aV"Oh, we really need a new concept."
p217
aVYou know, the Googlettes \u2014 that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,
p218
aVbut we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,
p219
aVsome of them will really work and turn out, such as News.
p220
aa(lp221
VBut then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.
p222
aVAnd I don't know about all of you,
p223
aVbut I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.
p224
aVAnd we found that if we just wrote all of them down
p225
aVand ordered them \u2014 and these are kind of made up.
p226
aVDon't really pay attention to them.
p227
aVFor example, the "Buy Iceland" was from a media article.
p228
aVWe would never do such a crazy thing, but \u2014
p229
aVin any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,
p230
aVthat most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.
p231
aVAnd this was kind of a surprise to me, but
p232
aVwe found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,
p233
aVwhich you did by writing them down,
p234
aVthat you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do
p235
aVand where to put your resources.
p236
aVAnd so that's basically what we've done
p237
aVsince we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative
p238
aVand still stay reasonably well-organized.
p239
aa(lp240
VThe other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important,
p241
aVand so naturally,
p242
aVpeople sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.
p243
aVI just wanted to highlight a couple of things
p244
aVthat are new, or you might not know about.
p245
aVAnd the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.
p246
aVSo this is a new \u2014 how many of you use the Google Toolbar?
p247
aVRaise your hands.
p248
aa(lp249
VHow many of you use the Deskbar?
p250
aVAll right, see? You guys should try it out.
p251
aVBut if you go to our site and search
p252
aVfor "Deskbar," you'll get this.
p253
aVAnd the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time
p254
aVon your screen on the bottom,
p255
aVand you can do searches really easily.
p256
aVAnd it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar.
p257
aVThank you, Sergey.
p258
aa(lp259
VThis is another example of a project that somebody at Google
p260
aVwas really passionate about, and they just, they got going,
p261
aVand it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.
p262
aVGoogle Answers is something we started, which is really cool,
p263
aVwhich lets you \u2014 for five to 100 dollars,
p264
aVyou can type a question in,
p265
aVand then there's a pool of researchers
p266
aVthat go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,
p267
aVand you can get actually very good answers to things
p268
aVwithout spending all that time yourself.
p269
aa(lp270
VFroogle lets you search shopping information,
p271
aVand Blogger lets you publish things.
p272
aVBut all of these \u2014 well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that \u2014
p273
aVyou know, we try many, many different things
p274
aVin our company.
p275
aVWe also like to innovate in our physical space,
p276
aVand we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time
p277
aVfor projectors to turn on and off,
p278
aVand they're noisy, so people shut them off.
p279
aVAnd we didn't like that, so we actually,
p280
aVin maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures
p281
aVthat enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time
p282
aVand they're completely silent.
p283
aVAnd as a result, we were able to build some software
p284
aVthat also lets us manage a meeting,
p285
aVso when you walk into a meeting room now,
p286
aVit lists all the meetings that are happening,
p287
aVyou can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically
p288
aVto all the people that were present in the meeting.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd as we become more of a global company,
p291
aVwe find these things really affect us \u2014
p292
aVyou know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?
p293
aVAnd things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.
p294
aVWe also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,
p295
aVand they don't always do their laundry as much as they should.
p296
aVAnd so we found it was pretty helpful
p297
aVto have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...
p298
aVwe also allow dogs and things like that,
p299
aVand we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company,
p300
aVwhich helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.
p301
aa(lp302
VThis is actually our "cult picture."
p303
aVI just wanted to show quickly.
p304
aVWe had this on our website for a while,
p305
aVbut we found that after we put it on our website,
p306
aVwe didn't get any job applications anymore.
p307
aVBut anyway, every year we've taken
p308
aVthe whole company on a ski trip.
p309
aVA lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.
p310
aVAnd I think we've done a good job encouraging that.
p311
aVIt makes it a really fun place to work.
p312
aa(lp313
VAlong with our logos, too, which I think really embody
p314
aVour culture when we change things.
p315
aVIn the early days, we were actually advised
p316
aVwe should never change our logo because
p317
aVwe should establish our brand, you know,
p318
aVbecause, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.
p319
aVYou want it to be consistent.
p320
aVAnd we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.
p321
aVWhy don't we try changing it every day?"
p322
aa(lp323
VOne of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now
p324
aVis we have this thing called AdSense,
p325
aVand this is a little bit foreshadowing \u2014
p326
aVthis is from before Dean dropped out.
p327
aVBut the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,
p328
aVwe show you relevant ads.
p329
aVAnd this is hard to read, but this says "Battle for New Hampshire:
p330
aVHoward Dean for President" \u2014 articles on Howard Dean.
p331
aVAnd these ads are generated automatically \u2014
p332
aVlike in this case, on the Washington Post \u2014
p333
aVfrom the content on the site.
p334
aVAnd so we use our over 150,000 advertisers
p335
aVand millions of advertisements, so we pick the one
p336
aVthat's most relevant to what you're actually looking at,
p337
aVmuch as we do on search.
p338
aVSo the idea is we can make advertising useful,
p339
aVnot just annoying, right?
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd the nice thing about this,
p342
aVwe have a self-serve program,
p343
aVand many thousands of websites have signed up,
p344
aVand this let's them really make money. And I \u2014
p345
aVyou know, there's a number of people I met \u2014
p346
aVI met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party,
p347
aVand he said, "You know, I wasn't making any money.
p348
aVI just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.
p349
aVAnd, you know, thank you.
p350
aVI don't have to do my other job now."
p351
aVAnd I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.
p352
aVIt makes content get better, it makes searching work better,
p353
aVwhen people can really make their livelihood
p354
aVfrom producing great content.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo this session is supposed to be about the future,
p357
aVso I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.
p358
aVAnd the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,
p359
aVyou really have to be smart.
p360
aVBecause you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,
p361
aVand you expect an answer back, right?
p362
aVBut finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.
p363
aVAnd in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.
p364
aVIt would be artificial intelligence.
p365
aVAnd so that's something we work on,
p366
aVand we even have some people who are excited enough
p367
aVand crazy enough to work on it now,
p368
aVand that's really their goal.
p369
aVSo we always hope that Google will be smart,
p370
aVbut we're always surprised when other people think that it is.
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.
p373
aVThis is a blog from Iraq,
p374
aVand it's not really what
p375
aVI'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.
p376
aVMaybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.
p377
aVSo we decided \u2014
p378
aVactually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo, "related searches," right there. You can't see it that well,
p381
aVbut we decided we should put in this feature
p382
aVinto our AdSense ads, called "related searches."
p383
aVAnd so we'd say, you know, "Did you mean 'search for'" \u2014 what is this,
p384
aVin this case, "Saddam Hussein," because this blog is about Iraq \u2014
p385
aVand you know, in addition to the ads,
p386
aVand we thought this would be a great idea.
p387
aa(lp388
VAnd so there is this blog
p389
aVof a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,
p390
aV"You know, I'm sleeping a lot."
p391
aVHe was just kind of writing about his life.
p392
aVAnd our algorithms \u2014 not a person, of course,
p393
aVbut our algorithms, our computers \u2014
p394
aVread his blog and decided that
p395
aVthe related search was, "I am bored."
p396
aVAnd he read this, and he thought a person had decided
p397
aVthat he was boring,
p398
aVand it was very unfortunate,
p399
aVand he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?
p400
aVWhy don't they like my blog?"
p401
aVAnd so then we read his blog, which was getting \u2014 you know,
p402
aVsort of going from bad to worse,
p403
aVand we said the related search was, "Retards."
p404
aVAnd then, you know, he got even more mad,
p405
aVand he wrote \u2014 like, started swearing and so on.
p406
aVAnd then we produced "You suck."
p407
aVAnd finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."
p408
aVAnd so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,
p409
aVand of course, you know,
p410
aVwe just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out,
p411
aVand it didn't quite work,
p412
aVand we don't have this feature anymore.
p413
aa(lp414
VSo with that, maybe I can switch back to the world.
p415
aVI wanted to end just by saying that
p416
aVthere's a couple things that really make me excited
p417
aVto be involved with Google,
p418
aVand one of those is that we're able to make money
p419
aVlargely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that
p420
aVwas that we're able to serve everyone in the world
p421
aVwithout worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.
p422
aVSo we don't have to worry about our products being sold,
p423
aVfor example, for less money in places that are poor,
p424
aVand then they get re-imported into the U.S. \u2014
p425
aVfor example, with the drug industry.
p426
aa(lp427
VAnd I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model
p428
aVbecause everyone in the world has access to our search,
p429
aVand I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit.
p430
aVThe other thing I wanted to mention just briefly
p431
aVis that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility
p432
aVto provide people the right information,
p433
aVand we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine \u2014
p434
aVthat we should provide very objective information.
p435
aa(lp436
VAnd so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results.
p437
aVWe accept payment for advertising,
p438
aVand we mark it as such.
p439
aVAnd that's unlike many of our competitors.
p440
aVAnd I think decisions we're able to make like that
p441
aVhave a tremendous impact on the world,
p442
aVand it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.
p443
aVSo thank you.

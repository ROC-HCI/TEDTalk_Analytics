VFor me they normally happen, these career crises,
p5
aVoften, actually, on a Sunday evening,
p6
aVjust as the sun is starting to set,
p7
aVand the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life
p8
aVstarts to diverge so painfully
p9
aVthat I normally end up weeping into a pillow.
p10
aa(lp11
VI'm mentioning all this \u2014
p12
aVI'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem;
p13
aVyou may think I'm wrong in this,
p14
aVbut I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated
p15
aVby career crises, by moments when what we thought we knew \u2014
p16
aVabout our lives, about our careers \u2014
p17
aVcomes into contact with a threatening sort of reality.
p18
aa(lp19
VIt's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living.
p20
aVIt's perhaps harder than ever before
p21
aVto stay calm, to be free of career anxiety.
p22
aVI want to look now, if I may, at some of the reasons
p23
aVwhy we might be feeling anxiety about our careers.
p24
aVWhy we might be victims of these career crises,
p25
aVas we're weeping softly into our pillows.
p26
aVOne of the reasons why we might be suffering
p27
aVis that we are surrounded by snobs.
p28
aa(lp29
VIn a way, I've got some bad news,
p30
aVparticularly to anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad.
p31
aVThere's a real problem with snobbery,
p32
aVbecause sometimes people from outside the U.K.
p33
aVimagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon,
p34
aVfixated on country houses and titles.
p35
aVThe bad news is that's not true.
p36
aVSnobbery is a global phenomenon; we are a global organization,
p37
aVthis is a global phenomenon.
p38
aVWhat is a snob?
p39
aVA snob is anybody who takes a small part of you,
p40
aVand uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are.
p41
aVThat is snobbery.
p42
aa(lp43
VThe dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery.
p44
aVYou encounter it within minutes at a party, when you get asked
p45
aVthat famous iconic question of the early 21st century,
p46
aV"What do you do?"
p47
aVAccording to how you answer that question,
p48
aVpeople are either incredibly delighted to see you,
p49
aVor look at their watch and make their excuses.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, the opposite of a snob is your mother.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VNot necessarily your mother, or indeed mine,
p58
aVbut, as it were, the ideal mother,
p59
aVsomebody who doesn't care about your achievements.
p60
aVUnfortunately, most people are not our mothers.
p61
aVMost people make a strict correlation between how much time,
p62
aVand if you like, love \u2014
p63
aVnot romantic love, though that may be something \u2014
p64
aVbut love in general, respect \u2014 they are willing to accord us,
p65
aVthat will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers
p68
aVand indeed start caring so much about material goods.
p69
aVYou know, we're often told that we live in very materialistic times,
p70
aVthat we're all greedy people.
p71
aVI don't think we are particularly materialistic.
p72
aVI think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards
p73
aVto the acquisition of material goods.
p74
aVIt's not the material goods we want; it's the rewards we want.
p75
aVIt's a new way of looking at luxury goods.
p76
aVThe next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari, don't think,
p77
aV"This is somebody who's greedy."
p78
aVThink, "This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love."
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VFeel sympathy, rather than contempt.
p83
aa(lp84
VThere are other reasons \u2014
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VThere are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before.
p89
aVOne of these, and it's paradoxical,
p90
aVbecause it's linked to something that's rather nice,
p91
aVis the hope we all have for our careers.
p92
aVNever before have expectations been so high
p93
aVabout what human beings can achieve with their lifespan.
p94
aVWe're told, from many sources, that anyone can achieve anything.
p95
aVWe've done away with the caste system,
p96
aVwe are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please.
p97
aVAnd it's a beautiful idea.
p98
aVAlong with that is a kind of spirit of equality;
p99
aVwe're all basically equal.
p100
aVThere are no strictly defined hierarchies.
p101
aVThere is one really big problem with this,
p102
aVand that problem is envy.
p103
aVEnvy, it's a real taboo to mention envy,
p104
aVbut if there's one dominant emotion in modern society, that is envy.
p105
aVAnd it's linked to the spirit of equality.
p106
aa(lp107
VLet me explain.
p108
aVI think it would be very unusual for anyone here, or anyone watching,
p109
aVto be envious of the Queen of England.
p110
aVEven though she is much richer than any of you are,
p111
aVand she's got a very large house,
p112
aVthe reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VShe's simply too strange.
p117
aVWe can't relate to her, she speaks in a funny way,
p118
aVshe comes from an odd place.
p119
aVSo we can't relate to her,
p120
aVand when you can't relate to somebody, you don't envy them.
p121
aa(lp122
VThe closer two people are \u2014 in age, in background,
p123
aVin the process of identification \u2014 the more there's a danger of envy,
p124
aVwhich is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion,
p125
aVbecause there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with.
p126
aVThe problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school.
p127
aVEverybody's wearing jeans, everybody's the same.
p128
aVAnd yet, they're not.
p129
aVSo there's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality,
p130
aVwhich can make for a very stressful situation.
p131
aa(lp132
VIt's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays
p133
aVbecome as rich and famous as Bill Gates,
p134
aVas it was unlikely in the 17th century
p135
aVthat you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy.
p136
aVBut the point is, it doesn't feel that way.
p137
aVIt's made to feel, by magazines and other media outlets,
p138
aVthat if you've got energy, a few bright ideas about technology, a garage \u2014
p139
aVyou, too, could start a major thing.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VThe consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops.
p144
aVWhen you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections,
p145
aVas I sometimes do \u2014
p146
aVif you analyze self-help books produced in the world today,
p147
aVthere are basically two kinds.
p148
aVThe first kind tells you, "You can do it! You can make it! Anything's possible!"
p149
aVThe other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call "low self-esteem,"
p150
aVor impolitely call, "feeling very bad about yourself."
p151
aa(lp152
VThere's a real correlation
p153
aVbetween a society that tells people that they can do anything,
p154
aVand the existence of low self-esteem.
p155
aVSo that's another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback.
p156
aVThere is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious \u2014
p157
aVabout our careers, about our status in the world today, than ever before.
p158
aVAnd it's, again, linked to something nice.
p159
aVAnd that nice thing is called meritocracy.
p160
aa(lp161
VEverybody, all politicians on Left and Right,
p162
aVagree that meritocracy is a great thing,
p163
aVand we should all be trying to make our societies really, really meritocratic.
p164
aVIn other words \u2014 what is a meritocratic society?
p165
aVA meritocratic society is one in which, if you've got talent and energy and skill,
p166
aVyou will get to the top, nothing should hold you back.
p167
aVIt's a beautiful idea.
p168
aVThe problem is, if you really believe in a society
p169
aVwhere those who merit to get to the top, get to the top,
p170
aVyou'll also, by implication, and in a far more nasty way,
p171
aVbelieve in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom
p172
aValso get to the bottom and stay there.
p173
aVIn other words, your position in life comes to seem not accidental,
p174
aVbut merited and deserved.
p175
aVAnd that makes failure seem much more crushing.
p176
aa(lp177
VYou know, in the Middle Ages, in England,
p178
aVwhen you met a very poor person,
p179
aVthat person would be described as an "unfortunate" \u2014
p180
aVliterally, somebody who had not been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.
p181
aVNowadays, particularly in the United States,
p182
aVif you meet someone at the bottom of society,
p183
aVthey may unkindly be described as a "loser."
p184
aVThere's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser,
p185
aVand that shows 400 years of evolution in society
p186
aVand our belief in who is responsible for our lives.
p187
aVIt's no longer the gods, it's us. We're in the driving seat.
p188
aa(lp189
VThat's exhilarating if you're doing well,
p190
aVand very crushing if you're not.
p191
aVIt leads, in the worst cases \u2014
p192
aVin the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim \u2014
p193
aVit leads to increased rates of suicide.
p194
aVThere are more suicides in developed, individualistic countries
p195
aVthan in any other part of the world.
p196
aVAnd some of the reason for that
p197
aVis that people take what happens to them extremely personally \u2014
p198
aVthey own their success, but they also own their failure.
p199
aa(lp200
VIs there any relief from some of these pressures
p201
aVthat I've been outlining?
p202
aVI think there is.
p203
aVI just want to turn to a few of them.
p204
aVLet's take meritocracy.
p205
aVThis idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to,
p206
aVI think it's a crazy idea, completely crazy.
p207
aVI will support any politician of Left and Right,
p208
aVwith any halfway-decent meritocratic idea;
p209
aVI am a meritocrat in that sense.
p210
aVBut I think it's insane to believe
p211
aVthat we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic;
p212
aVit's an impossible dream.
p213
aa(lp214
VThe idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded,
p215
aVthe good at the top, bad at the bottom,
p216
aVexactly done as it should be, is impossible.
p217
aVThere are simply too many random factors:
p218
aVaccidents, accidents of birth,
p219
aVaccidents of things dropping on people's heads, illnesses, etc.
p220
aVWe will never get to grade them,
p221
aVnever get to grade people as they should.
p222
aa(lp223
VI'm drawn to a lovely quote by St. Augustine in "The City of God,"
p224
aVwhere he says, "It's a sin to judge any man by his post."
p225
aVIn modern English that would mean
p226
aVit's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to,
p227
aVdependent on their business card.
p228
aVIt's not the post that should count.
p229
aVAccording to St. Augustine, only God can really put everybody in their place;
p230
aVhe's going to do that on the Day of Judgment,
p231
aVwith angels and trumpets, and the skies will open.
p232
aVInsane idea, if you're a secularist person, like me.
p233
aVBut something very valuable in that idea, nevertheless.
p234
aa(lp235
VIn other words, hold your horses when you're coming to judge people.
p236
aVYou don't necessarily know what someone's true value is.
p237
aVThat is an unknown part of them,
p238
aVand we shouldn't behave as though it is known.
p239
aVThere is another source of solace and comfort for all this.
p240
aVWhen we think about failing in life, when we think about failure,
p241
aVone of the reasons why we fear failing
p242
aVis not just a loss of income, a loss of status.
p243
aVWhat we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others.
p244
aVAnd it exists.
p245
aa(lp246
VThe number one organ of ridicule, nowadays, is the newspaper.
p247
aVIf you open the newspaper any day of the week,
p248
aVit's full of people who've messed up their lives.
p249
aVThey've slept with the wrong person, taken the wrong substance,
p250
aVpassed the wrong piece of legislation \u2014
p251
aVwhatever it is, and then are fit for ridicule.
p252
aVIn other words, they have failed. And they are described as "losers."
p253
aVNow, is there any alternative to this?
p254
aVI think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative, which is tragedy.
p255
aa(lp256
VTragic art, as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece,
p257
aVin the fifth century B.C., was essentially an art form
p258
aVdevoted to tracing how people fail,
p259
aVand also according them a level of sympathy,
p260
aVwhich ordinary life would not necessarily accord them.
p261
aVA few years ago, I was thinking about this,
p262
aVand I went to "The Sunday Sport,"
p263
aVa tabloid newspaper I don't recommend you start reading
p264
aVif you're not familiar with it already.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd I went to talk to them
p269
aVabout certain of the great tragedies of Western art.
p270
aVI wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories,
p271
aVif they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon.
p272
aa(lp273
VI mentioned Othello; they'd not heard of it but were fascinated.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VI asked them to write a headline for the story.
p278
aVThey came up with "Love-Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter."
p279
aVSplashed across the headline.
p280
aVI gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.
p281
aVAgain, a book they were enchanted to discover.
p282
aVAnd they wrote "Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud."
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd then my favorite \u2014
p287
aVthey really do have a kind of genius of their own, these guys \u2014
p288
aVmy favorite is Sophocles' Oedipus the King:
p289
aV"Sex With Mum Was Blinding."
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
V(Applause)
p294
aa(lp295
VIn a way, if you like, at one end of the spectrum of sympathy,
p296
aVyou've got the tabloid newspaper.
p297
aVAt the other end of the spectrum, you've got tragedy and tragic art.
p298
aVAnd I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit
p299
aVabout what's happening in tragic art.
p300
aVIt would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.
p301
aVHe is not a loser, though he has lost.
p302
aVAnd I think that is the message of tragedy to us,
p303
aVand why it's so very, very important, I think.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety,
p306
aVis that we have nothing at its center that is non-human.
p307
aVWe are the first society to be living in a world
p308
aVwhere we don't worship anything other than ourselves.
p309
aVWe think very highly of ourselves, and so we should;
p310
aVwe've put people on the Moon, done all sorts of extraordinary things.
p311
aVAnd so we tend to worship ourselves. Our heroes are human heroes.
p312
aVThat's a very new situation.
p313
aVMost other societies have had, right at their center,
p314
aVthe worship of something transcendent: a god, a spirit, a natural force,
p315
aVthe universe, whatever it is \u2014 something else that is being worshiped.
p316
aVWe've slightly lost the habit of doing that,
p317
aVwhich is, I think, why we're particularly drawn to nature.
p318
aVNot for the sake of our health, though it's often presented that way,
p319
aVbut because it's an escape from the human anthill.
p320
aVIt's an escape from our own competition,
p321
aVand our own dramas.
p322
aVAnd that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans,
p323
aVand contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters, etc.
p324
aVWe like to feel in contact with something that is non-human,
p325
aVand that is so deeply important to us.
p326
aa(lp327
VWhat I think I've been talking about really is success and failure.
p328
aVAnd one of the interesting things about success
p329
aVis that we think we know what it means.
p330
aVIf I said that there's somebody behind the screen who's very successful,
p331
aVcertain ideas would immediately come to mind.
p332
aVYou'd think that person might have made a lot of money,
p333
aVachieved renown in some field.
p334
aVMy own theory of success \u2014
p335
aVI'm somebody who's very interested in success,
p336
aVI really want to be successful,
p337
aValways thinking, how can I be more successful?
p338
aVBut as I get older, I'm also very nuanced about what that word "success" might mean.
p339
aa(lp340
VHere's an insight that I've had about success:
p341
aVYou can't be successful at everything.
p342
aVWe hear a lot of talk about work-life balance.
p343
aVNonsense.
p344
aVYou can't have it all. You can't.
p345
aVSo any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on,
p346
aVwhere the element of loss is.
p347
aVAnd I think any wise life will accept,
p348
aVas I say, that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time,
p351
aVour ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own.
p352
aVThey're sucked in from other people;
p353
aVchiefly, if you're a man, your father, and if you're a woman, your mother.
p354
aVPsychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years.
p355
aVNo one's quite listening hard enough, but I very much believe it's true.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd we also suck in messages from everything from the television,
p358
aVto advertising, to marketing, etc.
p359
aVThese are hugely powerful forces
p360
aVthat define what we want and how we view ourselves.
p361
aVWhen we're told that banking is a very respectable profession,
p362
aVa lot of us want to go into banking.
p363
aVWhen banking is no longer so respectable, we lose interest in banking.
p364
aVWe are highly open to suggestion.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo what I want to argue for is not that we should give up
p367
aVon our ideas of success,
p368
aVbut we should make sure that they are our own.
p369
aVWe should focus in on our ideas,
p370
aVand make sure that we own them;
p371
aVthat we are truly the authors of our own ambitions.
p372
aVBecause it's bad enough not getting what you want,
p373
aVbut it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want,
p374
aVand find out, at the end of the journey,
p375
aVthat it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo, I'm going to end it there.
p378
aVBut what I really want to stress is: by all means, success, yes.
p379
aVBut let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas.
p380
aVLet's probe away at our notions of success.
p381
aVLet's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own.
p382
aa(lp383
VThank you very much.
p384
aa(lp385
V(Applause)
p386
aa(lp387
VChris Anderson: That was fascinating.
p388
aVBut how do you reconcile this idea
p389
aVof it being bad to think of someone as a "loser,"
p390
aVwith the idea that a lot of people like, of seizing control of your life,
p391
aVand that a society that encourages that,
p392
aVperhaps has to have some winners and losers?
p393
aa(lp394
VAlain De Botton: Yes, I think it's merely the randomness
p395
aVof the winning and losing process that I want to stress,
p396
aVbecause the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything,
p397
aVand politicians always talk about justice.
p398
aVNow I'm a firm believer in justice, I just think that it's impossible.
p399
aVSo we should do everything we can to pursue it,
p400
aVbut we should always remember that whoever is facing us,
p401
aVwhatever has happened in their lives,
p402
aVthere will be a strong element of the haphazard.
p403
aVThat's what I'm trying to leave room for;
p404
aVotherwise, it can get quite claustrophobic.
p405
aa(lp406
VCA: I mean, do you believe that you can combine
p407
aVyour kind of kinder, gentler philosophy of work
p408
aVwith a successful economy?
p409
aVOr do you think that you can't,
p410
aVbut it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that?
p411
aa(lp412
VAB: The nightmare thought
p413
aVis that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them,
p414
aVand that somehow the crueler the environment,
p415
aVthe more people will rise to the challenge.
p416
aVYou want to think, who would you like as your ideal dad?
p417
aVAnd your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle.
p418
aVAnd it's a very hard line to make.
p419
aVWe need fathers, as it were, the exemplary father figures in society,
p420
aVavoiding the two extremes,
p421
aVwhich is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand,
p422
aVand on the other, the lax, no-rules option.
p423
aa(lp424
VCA: Alain De Botton.
p425
aa(lp426
VAB: Thank you very much.

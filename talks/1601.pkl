VAcross Europe and Central Asia,
p5
aVapproximately one million children live in large
p6
aVresidential institutions, usually known as orphanages.
p7
aVMost people imagine orphanages as a benign environment
p8
aVthat care for children.
p9
aVOthers know more about the living conditions there,
p10
aVbut still think they're a necessary evil.
p11
aVAfter all, where else would we put all of those children
p12
aVwho don't have any parents?
p13
aa(lp14
VBut 60 years of research has demonstrated
p15
aVthat separating children from their families
p16
aVand placing them in large institutions
p17
aVseriously harms their health and development,
p18
aVand this is particularly true for young babies.
p19
aVAs we know, babies are born
p20
aVwithout their full muscle development,
p21
aVand that includes the brain.
p22
aVDuring the first three years of life, the brain grows
p23
aVto its full size, with most of that growth taking place
p24
aVin the first six months. The brain develops
p25
aVin response to experience and to stimulation.
p26
aVEvery time a young baby learns something new \u2014
p27
aVto focus its eyes,
p28
aVto mimic a movement or a facial expression,
p29
aVto pick something up, to form a word or to sit up \u2014
p30
aVnew synaptic connections are being built in the brain.
p31
aVNew parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning.
p32
aVThey are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness.
p33
aVThey communicate their delight to their children,
p34
aVwho respond with smiles,
p35
aVand a desire to achieve more and to learn more.
p36
aVThis forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent
p37
aVprovides the building blocks for physical, social,
p38
aVlanguage, cognitive and psychomotor development.
p39
aVIt is the model for all future relationships with friends,
p40
aVwith partners and with their own children.
p41
aVIt happens so naturally in most families
p42
aVthat we don't even notice it. Most of us are unaware
p43
aVof its importance to human development and, by extension,
p44
aVto the development of a healthy society.
p45
aVAnd it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize
p46
aVthe importance of families to children.
p47
aa(lp48
VIn August, 1993, I had my first opportunity to witness
p49
aVon a massive scale the impact on children
p50
aVof institutionalization and the absence of parenting.
p51
aVThose of us who remember the newspaper reports
p52
aVthat came out of Romania after the 1989 revolution
p53
aVwill recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions.
p54
aVI was asked to help the director of a large institution to
p55
aVhelp prevent the separation of children from their families.
p56
aVHousing 550 babies, this was Ceausescu's show orphanage,
p57
aVand so I'd been told the conditions were much better.
p58
aVHaving worked with lots of young children, I expected
p59
aVthe institution to be a riot of noise,
p60
aVbut it was as silent as a convent.
p61
aVIt was hard to believe there were any children there at all,
p62
aVyet the director showed me into room after room,
p63
aVeach containing row upon row of cots,
p64
aVin each of which lay a child staring into space.
p65
aVIn a room of 40 newborns, not one of them was crying.
p66
aVYet I could see soiled nappies, and I could see
p67
aVthat some of the children were distressed,
p68
aVbut the only noise was a low, continuous moan.
p69
aVThe head nurse told me proudly,
p70
aV"You see, our children are very well-behaved."
p71
aVOver the next few days, I began to realize
p72
aVthat this quietness was not exceptional.
p73
aVThe newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours,
p74
aVbut their demands were not met, and so eventually
p75
aVthey learned not to bother. Within a few days,
p76
aVthey were listless, lethargic, and staring into space
p77
aVlike all the others.
p78
aa(lp79
VOver the years, many people and news reports
p80
aVhave blamed the personnel in the institutions
p81
aVfor the harm caused to the children, but often, one member
p82
aVof staff is caring for 10, 20, and even 40 children.
p83
aVHence they have no option but to implement a regimented program.
p84
aVThe children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30.
p85
aVAt 8, their nappies must be changed, so a staff member
p86
aVmay have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children.
p87
aVIf a child soils its nappy at 8:30, he will have to wait
p88
aVseveral hours before it can be changed again.
p89
aVThe child's daily contact with another human being
p90
aVis reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing,
p91
aVand otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling,
p92
aVthe walls or the bars of their cots.
p93
aa(lp94
VSince my first visit to Ceausescu's institution,
p95
aVI've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries,
p96
aVfrom the Czech Republic to Sudan.
p97
aVAcross all of these diverse lands and cultures,
p98
aVthe institutions, and the child's journey through them,
p99
aVis depressingly similar.
p100
aVLack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors
p101
aVlike hand-flapping, rocking back and forth,
p102
aVor aggression, and in some institutions, psychiatric drugs
p103
aVare used to control the behavior of these children,
p104
aVwhilst in others, children are tied up to prevent them
p105
aVfrom harming themselves or others.
p106
aVThese children are quickly labeled as having disabilities
p107
aVand transferred to another institution for children with disabilities.
p108
aVMost of these children will never leave the institution again.
p109
aVFor those without disabilities, at age three,
p110
aVthey're transferred to another institution, and at age seven,
p111
aVto yet another. Segregated according to age and gender,
p112
aVthey are arbitrarily separated from their siblings,
p113
aVoften without even a chance to say goodbye.
p114
aVThere's rarely enough to eat. They are often hungry.
p115
aVThe older children bully the little ones. They learn to
p116
aVsurvive. They learn to defend themselves, or they go under.
p117
aa(lp118
VWhen they leave the institution, they find it really difficult
p119
aVto cope and to integrate into society.
p120
aVIn Moldova, young women raised in institutions
p121
aVare 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers,
p122
aVand a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions,
p123
aVyoung adults, 20 percent of them had a criminal record,
p124
aV14 percent were involved in prostitution,
p125
aVand 10 percent had taken their own lives.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut why are there so many orphans in Europe
p128
aVwhen there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years?
p129
aVIn fact, more than 95 percent of these children have living parents,
p130
aVand societies tend to blame these parents
p131
aVfor abandoning these children, but research shows that
p132
aVmost parents want their children, and that the primary drivers
p133
aVbehind institutionalization
p134
aVare poverty, disability and ethnicity.
p135
aVMany countries have not developed inclusive schools,
p136
aVand so even children with a very mild disability
p137
aVare sent away to a residential special school,
p138
aVat age six or seven.
p139
aVThe institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home.
p140
aVIf the family's poor, they find it difficult to visit,
p141
aVand gradually the relationship breaks down.
p142
aVBehind each of the million children in institutions,
p143
aVthere is usually a story of parents who are desperate
p144
aVand feel they've run out of options, like Natalia in Moldova,
p145
aVwho only had enough money to feed her baby,
p146
aVand so had to send her older son to the institution;
p147
aVor Desi, in Bulgaria, who looked after her four children
p148
aVat home until her husband died,
p149
aVbut then she had to go out to work full time,
p150
aVand with no support, felt she had no option
p151
aVbut to place a child with disabilities in an institution;
p152
aVor the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents
p153
aVthey're pregnant, who leave their babies in a hospital;
p154
aVor the new parents, the young couple who have
p155
aVjust found out that their firstborn child has a disability,
p156
aVand instead of being provided with positive messages
p157
aVabout their child's potential, are told by the doctors,
p158
aV"Forget her, leave her in the institution,
p159
aVgo home and make a healthy one."
p160
aa(lp161
VThis state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable.
p162
aVEvery child has the right to a family, deserves
p163
aVand needs a family, and children are amazingly resilient.
p164
aVWe find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving
p165
aVfamilies early on, they recover their developmental delays,
p166
aVand go on to lead normal, happy lives.
p167
aVIt's also much cheaper to provide support to families
p168
aVthan it is to provide institutions.
p169
aVOne study suggests that a family support service
p170
aVcosts 10 percent of an institutional placement,
p171
aVwhilst good quality foster care
p172
aVcosts usually about 30 percent.
p173
aVIf we spend less on these children but on the right services,
p174
aVwe can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality
p175
aVresidential care for those few children with extremely complex needs.
p176
aa(lp177
VAcross Europe, a movement is growing to shift the focus
p178
aVand transfer the resources from large institutions
p179
aVthat provide poor quality care to community-based services
p180
aVthat protect children from harm and allow them to develop
p181
aVto their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania
p182
aVnearly 20 years ago, there were 200,000 children living
p183
aVin institutions, and more entering every day.
p184
aVNow, there are less than 10,000, and
p185
aVfamily support services are provided across the country.
p186
aVIn Moldova, despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects
p187
aVof the global financial crisis, the numbers of children
p188
aVin institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent
p189
aVin the last five years, and the resources are being
p190
aVredistributed to family support services and inclusive schools.
p191
aVMany countries have developed national action plans for change.
p192
aVThe European Commission and other major donors
p193
aVare finding ways to divert money from institutions
p194
aVtowards family support, empowering communities
p195
aVto look after their own children.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut there is still much to be done to end the systematic
p198
aVinstitutionalization of children.
p199
aVAwareness-raising is required at every level of society.
p200
aVPeople need to know the harm that institutions cause to children,
p201
aVand the better alternatives that exist.
p202
aVIf we know people who are planning to support orphanages,
p203
aVwe should convince them to support family services instead.
p204
aa(lp205
VTogether, this is the one form of child abuse
p206
aVthat we could eradicate in our lifetime.
p207

Why are 1 million children across Europe and Central Asia living in large orphanages, which are harmful to their health and psyches? Georgette Mulheir wants to put an end to this practice. She works tirelessly as the CEO of Lumos, an NGO founded by JK Rowling dedicated to ending worldwide systematic institutionalization. For the past 20 years Mulheir has worked primarily in Central and Eastern Europe to shift resources away from orphanages and toward alternate family services, such as foster care and day support.

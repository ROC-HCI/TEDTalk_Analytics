VA year ago, we were invited by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin
p5
aVto present our art projects.
p6
aVWe are used to invitations, but this invitation really thrilled us.
p7
aVThe Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.
p8
aVIt is the only old building in the government district
p9
aVthat was not destroyed during the Second World War,
p10
aVand it sits right next to the Federal Chancellery.
p11
aVNo one is closer to Chancellor Merkel than the Swiss diplomats.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VThe government district in Berlin also contains the Reichstag \u2014
p16
aVGermany's parliament \u2014 and the Brandenburg Gate,
p17
aVand right next to the gate there are other embassies,
p18
aVin particular the US and the British Embassy.
p19
aa(lp20
VAlthough Germany is an advanced democracy,
p21
aVcitizens are limited in their constitutional rights
p22
aVin its government district.
p23
aVThe right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there.
p24
aVAnd this is interesting from an artistic point of view.
p25
aVThe opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself
p26
aVare always bound to a certain order
p27
aVand always subject to a specific regulation.
p28
aVWith an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations,
p29
aVwe can gain a new perspective.
p30
aVThe given terms and conditions shape our perception, our actions
p31
aVand our lives.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd this is crucial in another context.
p34
aVOver the last couple of years,
p35
aVwe learned that from the roofs of the US and the British Embassy,
p36
aVthe secret services have been listening to the entire district,
p37
aVincluding the mobile phone of Angela Merkel.
p38
aVThe antennas of the British GCHQ are hidden in a white cylindrical radome,
p39
aVwhile the listening post of the American NSA
p40
aVis covered by radio transparent screens.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut how to address these hidden and disguised forces?
p43
aVWith my colleague, Christoph Wachter,
p44
aVwe accepted the invitation of the Swiss Embassy.
p45
aVAnd we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation.
p46
aa(lp47
VIf people are spying on us, it stands to reason
p48
aVthat they have to listen to what we are saying.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VOn the roof of the Swiss Embassy, we installed a series of antennas.
p53
aVThey weren't as sophisticated as those used by the Americans and the British.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VThey were makeshift can antennas,
p58
aVnot camouflaged but totally obvious and visible.
p59
aVThe Academy of Arts joined the project,
p60
aVand so we built another large antenna on their rooftop,
p61
aVexactly between the listening posts of the NSA and the GCHQ.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VNever have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation.
p66
aVA helicopter circled over our heads
p67
aVwith a camera registering each and every move we made,
p68
aVand on the roof of the US Embassy, security officers patrolled.
p69
aVAlthough the government district is governed by a strict police order,
p70
aVthere are no specific laws relating to digital communication.
p71
aVOur installation was therefore perfectly legal,
p72
aVand the Swiss Ambassador informed Chancellor Merkel about it.
p73
aVWe named the project "Can You Hear Me?"
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VThe antennas created an open and free Wi-Fi communication network
p78
aVin which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate
p79
aVusing any Wi-Fi-enabled device without any hindrance,
p80
aVand be able to send messages
p81
aVto those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted.
p82
aVText messages, voice chat, file sharing \u2014
p83
aVanything could be sent anonymously.
p84
aVAnd people did communicate.
p85
aVOver 15,000 messages were sent.
p86
aVHere are some examples.
p87
aa(lp88
V"Hello world, hello Berlin, hello NSA, hello GCHQ."
p89
aa(lp90
V"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing! Blow the whistle!"
p91
aa(lp92
V"This is the NSA. In God we trust. All others we track!!!!!"
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
V"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ - we are part of your organizations.
p97
aV# expect us. We will #shutdown"
p98
aa(lp99
V"This is the NSA's Achilles heel. Open Networks."
p100
aa(lp101
V"Agents, what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren?"
p102
aa(lp103
V"@NSA My neighbors are noisy. Please send a drone strike."
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
V"Make Love, Not cyberwar."
p108
aa(lp109
VWe invited the embassies and the government departments
p110
aVto participate in the open network, too,
p111
aVand to our surprise, they did.
p112
aVFiles appeared on the network, including classified documents
p113
aVleaked from the parliamentary investigation commission,
p114
aVwhich highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information
p115
aVis starting to become difficult, even for members of a parliament.
p116
aVWe also organized guided tours to experience and sound out
p117
aVthe power constellations on-site.
p118
aVThe tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies,
p119
aVand we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication.
p120
aa(lp121
VIf we become aware of the constellation,
p122
aVthe terms and conditions of communication,
p123
aVit not only broadens our horizon,
p124
aVit allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview,
p125
aVour specific social, political or aesthetic conventions.
p126
aa(lp127
VLet's look at an actual example.
p128
aVThe fate of people living in the makeshift settlements
p129
aVon the outskirts of Paris
p130
aVis hidden and faded from view.
p131
aVIt's a vicious circle.
p132
aVIt's not poverty, not racism, not exclusion that are new.
p133
aVWhat is new is how these realities are hidden
p134
aVand how people are made invisible
p135
aVin an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange.
p136
aVSuch makeshift settlements are considered illegal,
p137
aVand therefore those living in them don't have a chance
p138
aVof making their voices heard.
p139
aVOn the contrary, every time they appear, every time they risk becoming visible,
p140
aVmerely gives grounds for further persecution,
p141
aVexpulsion and suppression.
p142
aVWhat interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side.
p143
aVWe were searching for an interface and we found one.
p144
aVIt's not a digital interface, but a physical one: it's a hotel.
p145
aa(lp146
VWe named the project "Hotel Gelem."
p147
aVTogether with Roma families, we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,
p148
aVfor example, in Freiburg in Germany, in Montreuil near Paris,
p149
aVand also in the Balkans.
p150
aVThese are real hotels.
p151
aVPeople can stay there.
p152
aVBut they aren't a commercial enterprise.
p153
aVThey are a symbol.
p154
aVYou can go online and ask for a personal invitation
p155
aVto come and live for a few days in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,
p156
aVeating, working and living with the Roma families.
p157
aVHere, the Roma families are not the travelers;
p158
aVthe visitors are.
p159
aVHere, the Roma families are not a minority;
p160
aVthe visitors are.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe point is not to make judgments,
p163
aVbut rather to find out about the context that determines
p164
aVthese disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions.
p165
aVIn the world of globalization,
p166
aVthe continents are drifting closer to each other.
p167
aVCultures, goods and people are in permanent exchange,
p168
aVbut at the same time, the gap between the world of the privileged
p169
aVand the world of the excluded is growing.
p170
aa(lp171
VWe were recently in Australia.
p172
aVFor us, it was no problem to enter the country.
p173
aVWe have European passports, visas and air tickets.
p174
aVBut asylum seekers who arrive by boat in Australia
p175
aVare deported or taken to prison.
p176
aVThe interception of the boats
p177
aVand the disappearance of the people into the detention system
p178
aVare veiled by the Australian authorities.
p179
aVThese procedures are declared to be secret military operations.
p180
aVAfter dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones,
p181
aVmen, women and children are detained by Australia without trial,
p182
aVsometimes for years.
p183
aa(lp184
VDuring our stay, however,
p185
aVwe managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned,
p186
aVdespite strict screening and isolation.
p187
aVFrom these contexts was born an installation in the art space
p188
aVof the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.
p189
aa(lp190
VOn the face of it, it was a very simple installation.
p191
aVOn the floor, a stylized compass gave the direction
p192
aVto each immigration detention center,
p193
aVaccompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility.
p194
aVBut the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity.
p195
aVAbove every floor marking, there was a headset.
p196
aVVisitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee
p197
aVwho was or had been imprisoned
p198
aVin a specific detention facility
p199
aVand engage in a personal conversation.
p200
aVIn the protected context of the art exhibition,
p201
aVasylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves,
p202
aVtheir story and their situation, without fear of consequences.
p203
aVVisitors immersed themselves in long conversations
p204
aVabout families torn apart, about dramatic escapes from war zones,
p205
aVabout suicide attempts,
p206
aVabout the fate of children in detention.
p207
aVEmotions ran deep. Many wept.
p208
aVSeveral revisited the exhibition.
p209
aVIt was a powerful experience.
p210
aa(lp211
VEurope is now facing a stream of migrants.
p212
aVThe situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies
p213
aVand the temptation of militarized responses.
p214
aVWe have also established communication systems
p215
aVin remote refugee centers in Switzerland and Greece.
p216
aVThey are all about providing basic information \u2014 weather forecasts,
p217
aVlegal information, guidance.
p218
aVBut they are significant.
p219
aVInformation on the Internet
p220
aVthat could ensure survival along dangerous routes
p221
aVis being censored,
p222
aVand the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized.
p223
aa(lp224
VThis brings us back to our network and to the antennas
p225
aVon the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin
p226
aVand the "Can You Hear Me?" project.
p227
aVWe should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected.
p228
aVWe should start making our own connections,
p229
aVfighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world.
p230
aVThis is essential to overcome our speechlessness
p231
aVand the separation provoked by rival political forces.
p232
aVIt is only in truly exposing ourselves
p233
aVto the transformative power of this experience
p234
aVthat we can overcome prejudice and exclusion.
p235
aa(lp236
VThank you.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias.
p241
aVThe other half of your artistic duo is also here.
p242
aVChristoph Wachter, come onstage.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Applause)
p245
aa(lp246
VFirst, tell me just a detail:
p247
aVthe name of the hotel is not a random name.
p248
aVGelem means something specific in the Roma language.
p249
aa(lp250
VMathias Jud: Yes, "Gelem, Gelem" is the title of the Romani hymn,
p251
aVthe official, and it means "I went a long way."
p252
aa(lp253
VBG: That's just to add the detail to your talk.
p254
aVBut you two traveled to the island of Lesbos
p255
aVvery recently, you're just back a couple of days ago,
p256
aVin Greece, where thousands of refugees are arriving
p257
aVand have been arriving over the last few months.
p258
aVWhat did you see there and what did you do there?
p259
aa(lp260
VChristoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one of the Greek islands close to Turkey,
p261
aVand during our stay,
p262
aVmany asylum seekers arrived by boat on overcrowded dinghies,
p263
aVand after landing, they were left completely on their own.
p264
aVThey are denied many services.
p265
aVFor example, they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket
p266
aVor to rent a hotel room,
p267
aVso many families literally sleep in the streets.
p268
aVAnd we installed networks there to allow basic communication,
p269
aVbecause I think, I believe,
p270
aVit's not only that we have to speak about the refugees,
p271
aVI think we need to start talking to them.
p272
aVAnd by doing so, we can realize that it is about human beings,
p273
aVabout their lives and their struggle to survive.
p274
aa(lp275
VBG: And allow them to talk as well.
p276
aVChristoph, thank you for coming to TED.
p277
aVMathias, thank you for coming to TED and sharing your story.
p278
aa(lp279

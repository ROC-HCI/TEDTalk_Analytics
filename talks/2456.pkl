VI come from one of the most liberal,
p5
aVtolerant, progressive places in the United States,
p6
aVSeattle, Washington.
p7
aVAnd I grew up with a family of great Seattlites.
p8
aVMy mother was an artist, my father was a college professor,
p9
aVand I am truly grateful for my upbringing,
p10
aVbecause I always felt completely comfortable designing my life
p11
aVexactly as I saw fit.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd in point of fact,
p14
aVI took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind.
p15
aVWhen I was 19, I dropped out of college \u2014
p16
aVdropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd I went on the road as a professional French horn player,
p21
aVwhich was my lifelong dream.
p22
aVI played chamber music all over the United States and Europe,
p23
aVand I toured for a couple of years
p24
aVwith a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird.
p25
aVAnd by the end of my 20s,
p26
aVI wound up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
p27
aVWhat a great life.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd you know, my parents never complained.
p30
aVThey supported me all the way through it.
p31
aVIt wasn't their dream.
p32
aVThey used to tell their neighbors and friends,
p33
aV"Our son, he's taking a gap decade."
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd \u2014
p38
aVThere was, however, one awkward conversation about my lifestyle
p39
aVthat I want to tell you about.
p40
aVI was 27, and I was home from Barcelona,
p41
aVand I was visiting my parents for Christmas,
p42
aVand I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were alone in the kitchen.
p43
aVAnd she was quiet, too quiet.
p44
aVSomething was wrong.
p45
aVAnd so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"
p46
aVAnd she said, "Your dad and I are really worried about you."
p47
aVAnd I said, "What?" I mean, what could it be, at this point?
p48
aVAnd she said, "I want you to be completely honest with me:
p49
aVhave you been voting for Republicans?"
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, the truth is,
p54
aVI wasn't really political, I was just a French horn player.
p55
aVBut I had a bit of an epiphany,
p56
aVand they had detected it, and it was causing some confusion.
p57
aVYou see, I had become an enthusiast for capitalism,
p58
aVand I want to tell you why that is.
p59
aVIt stems from a lifelong interest of mine
p60
aVin, believe it or not, poverty.
p61
aa(lp62
VSee, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle,
p63
aVI remember the first time I saw real poverty.
p64
aVWe were a lower middle class family, but that's of course not real poverty.
p65
aVThat's not even close.
p66
aVThe first time I saw poverty, and poverty's face,
p67
aVwas when I was six or seven years old, early 1970s.
p68
aVAnd it was like a lot of you, kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.
p69
aVIt was a picture in the National Geographic Magazine
p70
aVof a kid who was my age in East Africa,
p71
aVand there were flies on his face and a distended belly.
p72
aVAnd he wasn't going to make it, and I knew that, and I was helpless.
p73
aVSome of you remember that picture,
p74
aVnot exactly that picture, one just like it.
p75
aVIt introduced the West to grinding poverty around the world.
p76
aVWell, that vision kind of haunted me as I grew up and I went to school
p77
aVand I dropped out and dropped in
p78
aVand started my family.
p79
aVAnd I wondered, what happened to that kid?
p80
aVOr to people just like him all over the world?
p81
aVAnd so I started to study, even though I wasn't in college,
p82
aVI was looking for the answer:
p83
aVwhat happened to the world's poorest people?
p84
aVHas it gotten worse? Has it gotten better? What?
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd I found the answer, and it changed my life,
p87
aVand I want to share it with you.
p88
aa(lp89
VSee \u2014
p90
aVmost Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse
p91
aVsince we were children, since they saw that vision.
p92
aVIf you ask Americans, "Has poverty gotten worse or better around the world?",
p93
aV70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s.
p94
aVBut here's the truth.
p95
aVHere's the epiphany that I had that changed my thinking.
p96
aVFrom 1970 until today,
p97
aVthe percentage of the world's population
p98
aVliving in starvation levels,
p99
aVliving on a dollar a day or less, obviously adjusted for inflation,
p100
aVthat percentage has declined
p101
aVby 80 percent.
p102
aVThere's been an 80 percent decline in the world's worst poverty
p103
aVsince I was a kid.
p104
aVAnd I didn't even know about it.
p105
aVThis, my friends, that's a miracle.
p106
aVThat's something we ought to celebrate.
p107
aVIt's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind,
p108
aVand it happened in our lifetimes.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
VSo when I learned this, I asked, what did that? What made it possible?
p113
aVBecause if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
p114
aVIf you want to replicate it
p115
aVand get the next two billion people out of poverty,
p116
aVbecause that's what we're talking about: since I was a kid,
p117
aVtwo billion of the least of these, our brothers and sisters,
p118
aVhave been pulled out of poverty.
p119
aVI want the next two billion, so I've got to know why.
p120
aVAnd I went in search of an answer.
p121
aVAnd it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.
p122
aVYou know what, I still don't care.
p123
aVI wanted the best answer from mainstream economists
p124
aVleft, right and center.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd here it is.
p127
aVHere are the reasons.
p128
aVThere are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters
p129
aVhave been pulled out of poverty since I was a kid.
p130
aVNumber one: globalization.
p131
aVNumber two: free trade.
p132
aVNumber three: property rights.
p133
aVNumber four: rule of law.
p134
aVNumber five: entrepreneurship.
p135
aVIt was the free enterprise system spreading around the world
p136
aVafter 1970 that did that.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, I'm not naive.
p139
aVI know that free enterprise isn't perfect,
p140
aVand I know that free enterprise isn't everything we need
p141
aVto build a better world.
p142
aVBut that is great.
p143
aVAnd that's beyond politics.
p144
aVHere's what I learned. This is the epiphany.
p145
aVCapitalism is not just about accumulation.
p146
aVAt its best, it's about aspiration,
p147
aVwhich is what so many people on this stage talk about,
p148
aVis the aspiration that comes from dreams
p149
aVthat are embedded in the free enterprise system.
p150
aVAnd we've got to share it with more people.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, I want to tell you about a second epiphany
p153
aVthat's related to that first one
p154
aVthat I think can bring us progress, not just around the world,
p155
aVbut right here at home.
p156
aVThe best quote I've ever heard
p157
aVto summarize the thoughts that I've just given you
p158
aVabout pulling people out of poverty
p159
aVis as follows:
p160
aV"Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
p161
aVThey have lifted billions out of poverty."
p162
aa(lp163
VWho said it?
p164
aVIt sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
p165
aVWrong.
p166
aVPresident Barack Obama said that.
p167
aVWhy do I know it by heart?
p168
aVBecause he said it to me.
p169
aVCrazy.
p170
aVAnd I said, "Hallelujah."
p171
aVBut more than that, I said,
p172
aV"What an opportunity."
p173
aa(lp174
VYou know what I was thinking?
p175
aVIt was at an event that we were doing on the subject
p176
aVat Georgetown University in May of 2015.
p177
aVAnd I thought, this is the solution
p178
aVto the biggest problem facing America today. What?
p179
aVIt's coming together around these ideas,
p180
aVliberals and conservatives,
p181
aVto help people who need us the most.
p182
aa(lp183
VNow, I don't have to tell anybody in this room that we're in a crisis,
p184
aVin America and many countries around the world with political polarization.
p185
aVIt's risen to critical, crisis levels.
p186
aVIt's unpleasant. It's not right.
p187
aVThere was an article last year
p188
aVin the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
p189
aVwhich is one of the most prestigious scientific journals
p190
aVpublished in the West.
p191
aVAnd it was an article in 2014
p192
aVon political motive asymmetry.
p193
aVWhat's that? That's what psychologists call the phenomenon
p194
aVof assuming that your ideology is based in love
p195
aVbut your opponents' ideology is based in hate.
p196
aVIt's common in world conflict.
p197
aVYou expect to see this between Palestinians and Israelis, for example.
p198
aVWhat the authors of this article found
p199
aVwas that in America today, a majority of Republicans and Democrats
p200
aVsuffer from political motive asymmetry.
p201
aVA majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe
p202
aVthat they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate.
p203
aVThink about it. Think about it.
p204
aVMost people are walking around saying,
p205
aV"You know, my ideology is based on basic benevolence,
p206
aVI want to help people,
p207
aVbut the other guys, they're evil and out to get me."
p208
aVYou can't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry.
p209
aVIt's impossible.
p210
aa(lp211
VHow do we solve it?
p212
aVWell, first, let's be honest: there are differences.
p213
aVLet's not minimize the differences. That would be really naïve.
p214
aVThere's a lot of good research on this.
p215
aVA veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
p216
aVHe's a psychology professor at New York University.
p217
aVHe does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people
p218
aVto see how they differ.
p219
aVAnd he's shown, for example, that conservatives and liberals
p220
aVhave a very different emphasis on what they think is important.
p221
aVFor example, Jon Haidt has shown
p222
aVthat liberals care about poverty
p223
aV59 percent more than they care about economic liberty.
p224
aVAnd conservatives care about economic liberty
p225
aV28 percent more than they care about poverty.
p226
aa(lp227
VIrreconcilable differences, right?
p228
aVWe'll never come together. Wrong.
p229
aVThat is diversity in which lies our strength.
p230
aVRemember what pulled up the poor.
p231
aVIt was the obsession with poverty,
p232
aVaccompanied by the method of economic freedom
p233
aVspreading around the world.
p234
aVWe need each other, in other words,
p235
aVif we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty.
p236
aVThere's no other way.
p237
aa(lp238
VHmm.
p239
aVHow are we going to get that?
p240
aVIt's a tricky thing, isn't it.
p241
aVWe need innovative thinking.
p242
aVA lot of it's on this stage.
p243
aVSocial entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
p244
aVWe need investment overseas
p245
aVin a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.
p246
aa(lp247
VBut you know what we really need?
p248
aVWe need a new day in flexible ideology.
p249
aVWe need to be less predictable.
p250
aVDon't we?
p251
aVDo you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable?
p252
aVKinda conventional?
p253
aVDo you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
p254
aVWhy is that dangerous?
p255
aVBecause when we talk in this country about economics,
p256
aVon the right, conservatives,
p257
aVyou're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government.
p258
aVAnd on the left, liberals, you're talking about economics,
p259
aVit's always about income inequality.
p260
aVRight? Now those are important things,
p261
aVreally important to me, really important to you.
p262
aVBut when it comes to lifting people up
p263
aVwho are starving and need us today, those are distractions.
p264
aVWe need to come together around the best ways
p265
aVto mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal,
p266
aVand that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals
p267
aVand their obsession with poverty,
p268
aVand liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets.
p269
aVThat's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country,
p270
aVif we choose to take it.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?
p273
aVI've got to have some action items, not just for you but for me.
p274
aVNumber one. Action item number one:
p275
aVremember, it's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree.
p276
aVIt's not good enough.
p277
aVWe have to remember that we need people who disagree with us,
p278
aVbecause there are people who need all of us
p279
aVwho are still waiting for these tools.
p280
aVNow, what are you going to do? How are you going to express that?
p281
aVWhere does this start? It starts here.
p282
aVYou know, all of us in this room, we're blessed.
p283
aVWe're blessed with people who listen to us.
p284
aVWe're blessed with prosperity. We're blessed with leadership.
p285
aVWhen people hear us, with the kind of unpredictable ideology,
p286
aVthen maybe people will listen.
p287
aVMaybe progress will start at that point.
p288
aVThat's number one. Number two.
p289
aVNumber two: I'm asking you and I'm asking me
p290
aVto be the person specifically who blurs the lines,
p291
aVwho is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.
p292
aVIf you're a conservative,
p293
aVbe the conservative who is always going on about poverty
p294
aVand the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.
p295
aVAnd if you're a liberal, be a liberal who is always talking
p296
aVabout the beauty of free markets to solve our problems
p297
aVwhen we use them responsibly.
p298
aa(lp299
VIf we do that, we get two things.
p300
aVNumber one: we get to start to work on the next two billion
p301
aVand be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past
p302
aVand we need to see more of in the future. That's what we get.
p303
aVAnd the second is that we might just be able
p304
aVto take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under in this country
p305
aVand turn it into a competition of ideas
p306
aVbased on solidarity and mutual respect.
p307
aVAnd then maybe, just maybe,
p308
aVwe'll all realize that our big differences
p309
aVaren't really that big after all.
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you.

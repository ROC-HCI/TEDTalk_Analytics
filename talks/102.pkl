VSo I'm going to speak about a problem that I have
p5
aVand that's that I'm a philosopher.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VWhen I go to a party and people ask me what do I do
p10
aVand I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over.
p11
aVWhen I go to an academic cocktail party
p12
aVand there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in
p13
aVand I say, "philosophy" \u2014 their eyes glaze over.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VWhen I go to a philosopher's party
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
Vand they ask me what I work on and I say, "consciousness,"
p22
aVtheir eyes don't glaze over \u2014 their lips curl into a snarl.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls
p27
aVbecause they think, "That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness."
p28
aVThe very chutzpah of somebody thinking
p29
aVthat you could explain consciousness is just out of the question.
p30
aa(lp31
VMy late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher,
p32
aVin one of his books, "Philosophical Explanations,"
p33
aVis commenting on the ethos of philosophy \u2014
p34
aVthe way philosophers go about their business.
p35
aVAnd he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument."
p36
aVAnd he says, "It seems as if the ideal argument
p37
aVfor most philosophers is you give your audience the premises
p38
aVand then you give them the inferences and the conclusion,
p39
aVand if they don't accept the conclusion, they die.
p40
aVTheir heads explode." The idea is to have an argument
p41
aVthat is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.
p42
aVBut in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all.
p43
aa(lp44
VIt's very hard to change people's minds
p45
aVabout something like consciousness,
p46
aVand I finally figured out the reason for that.
p47
aVThe reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness.
p48
aVWe heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games.
p49
aVThey all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts.
p50
aVBut they don't consider themselves experts on video games;
p51
aVthey've just got strong opinions.
p52
aVI'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change
p53
aVand global warming, or on the future of the Internet,
p54
aVencounter people who have very strong opinions
p55
aVabout what's going to happen next.
p56
aVBut they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.
p57
aVThey're just strongly held opinions.
p58
aVBut with regard to consciousness, people seem to think,
p59
aVeach of us seems to think, "I am an expert.
p60
aVSimply by being conscious, I know all about this."
p61
aVAnd so, you tell them your theory and they say,
p62
aV"No, no, that's not the way consciousness is!
p63
aVNo, you've got it all wrong."
p64
aVAnd they say this with an amazing confidence.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd so what I'm going to try to do today
p67
aVis to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling \u2014
p68
aVI can feel it myself.
p69
aVI want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds \u2014
p70
aVthat you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness.
p71
aVThat's the order of the day here.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble.
p74
aVI think everybody understands what that means.
p75
aVThat's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.
p76
aVThis is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.
p77
aVIt's a Saul Steinberg of course \u2014 it was a New Yorker cover.
p78
aVAnd this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.
p79
aVThat reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle,
p80
aVSuzanne R. \u2014 he's off to the races.
p81
aVThere's a wonderful stream of consciousness here
p82
aVand if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.
p83
aVWhat I particularly like about this picture, too,
p84
aVis that Steinberg has rendered the guy
p85
aVin this sort of pointillist style.
p86
aa(lp87
VWhich reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday:
p88
aVwhat we are, what each of us is \u2014 what you are, what I am \u2014
p89
aVis approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.
p90
aVThat's what we're made of.
p91
aVNo other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.
p92
aVNot a single one of those cells is conscious;
p93
aVnot a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares.
p94
aVSomehow, we have to explain
p95
aVhow when you put together teams, armies, battalions
p96
aVof hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells \u2014
p97
aVnot so different really from a bacterium, each one of them \u2014
p98
aVthe result is this. I mean, just look at it.
p99
aVThe content \u2014 there's color, there's ideas, there's memories,
p100
aVthere's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness
p101
aVis accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons.
p102
aVHow is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all.
p103
aVThey think, "No, there can't be any
p104
aVsort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness."
p105
aa(lp106
VThis is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel,
p107
aVwho's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii,
p108
aVand he's an expert magician, and an expert
p109
aVon the street magic of India, which is what this book is about,
p110
aV"Net of Magic."
p111
aVAnd there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you.
p112
aVIt speaks so eloquently to the problem.
p113
aV"'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?'
p114
aVBy 'real magic,' people mean miracles,
p115
aVthaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers.
p116
aV'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.'
p117
aV'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real;
p118
aVwhile the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic."
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VReal consciousness is not a bag of tricks.
p127
aVIf you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks,
p128
aVthen it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.
p129
aVAnd, as Marvin said, and as other people have said,
p130
aV"Consciousness is a bag of tricks."
p131
aVThis means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied
p132
aVand incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.
p133
aVSo this is the problem. So I have to
p134
aVdo a little bit of the sort of work
p135
aVthat a lot of you won't like,
p136
aVfor the same reason that you don't like to see
p137
aVa magic trick explained to you.
p138
aVHow many of you here, if somebody \u2014 some smart aleck \u2014
p139
aVstarts telling you how a particular magic trick is done,
p140
aVyou sort of want to block your ears and say, "No, no, I don't want to know!
p141
aVDon't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified.
p142
aVDon't tell me the answer."
p143
aVA lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered.
p144
aVAnd I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you.
p145
aVYou'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks.
p146
aa(lp147
VBut I'm not going to explain it all to you.
p148
aVI'm going to do what philosophers do.
p149
aVHere's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick.
p150
aVYou know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick?
p151
aVThe philosopher says, "I'm going to explain to you how that's done.
p152
aVYou see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half."
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
V"He merely makes you think that he does."
p157
aVAnd you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?"
p158
aVHe says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry."
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VSo now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness.
p163
aVBut I'm going to try to also show you
p164
aVthat consciousness isn't quite as marvelous \u2014
p165
aVyour own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful \u2014
p166
aVas you may have thought it is.
p167
aVThis is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book.
p168
aVHe marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards
p169
aVpeople will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things.
p170
aVHe didn't even try to do those things.
p171
aVPeople's memories inflate what they think they saw.
p172
aVAnd the same is true of consciousness.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this.
p175
aVWatch it carefully.
p176
aVI'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian
p177
aVnamed Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me,
p178
aVpart of a larger project some of you may be interested in.
p179
aVWe're looking for a backer.
p180
aVIt's a feature-length documentary on consciousness.
p181
aVOK, now, you all saw what changed, right?
p182
aVHow many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?
p183
aVEvery one. I'll just show you by running it again.
p184
aVEven when you know that they're all going to change color,
p185
aVit's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate
p186
aVto pick up any of the changes at all.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow, this is an example \u2014 one of many \u2014
p189
aVof a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit.
p190
aVIt's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my
p191
aV1991 book, "Consciousness Explained,"
p192
aVwhere I said if you did experiments of this sort,
p193
aVyou'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.
p194
aVIf there's time at the end,
p195
aVI'll show you the much more dramatic case.
p196
aVNow, how can it be that there are all those changes going on,
p197
aVand that we're not aware of them?
p198
aVWell, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades,
p199
aVthe way your eye moves around three or four times a second.
p200
aVHe didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion,
p201
aVmoving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows,
p202
aVlooking at interesting things in the world.
p203
aVAnd where your eye isn't looking,
p204
aVyou're remarkably impoverished in your vision.
p205
aVThat's because the foveal part of your eye,
p206
aVwhich is the high-resolution part,
p207
aVis only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.
p208
aVThat's the detail part.
p209
aVIt doesn't seem that way, does it?
p210
aVIt doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is.
p211
aVYou're getting in a lot less information than you think.
p212
aa(lp213
VHere's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto.
p214
aVIt's in the museum in North Carolina.
p215
aVBellotto was a student of Canaletto's.
p216
aVAnd I love paintings like that \u2014
p217
aVthe painting is actually about as big as it is right here.
p218
aVAnd I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail,
p219
aVand you can get right up
p220
aVand see all the details on the painting.
p221
aVAnd I started across the hall in North Carolina,
p222
aVbecause I thought it was probably a Canaletto,
p223
aVand would have all that in detail.
p224
aVAnd I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people \u2014
p225
aVyou can just barely see them walking across the bridge.
p226
aVAnd I thought as I got closer
p227
aVI would be able to see all the detail of most people,
p228
aVsee their clothes, and so forth.
p229
aVAnd as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.
p230
aVI yelled out because when I got closer,
p231
aVI found the detail wasn't there at all.
p232
aVThere were just little artfully placed blobs of paint.
p233
aVAnd as I walked towards the picture,
p234
aVI was expecting detail that wasn't there.
p235
aVThe artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes
p236
aVand wagons and all sorts of things,
p237
aVand my brain had taken the suggestion.
p238
aa(lp239
VYou're familiar with a more recent technology, which is \u2014 There,
p240
aVyou can get a better view of the blobs.
p241
aVSee, when you get close
p242
aVthey're really just blobs of paint.
p243
aVYou will have seen something like this \u2014 this is the reverse effect.
p244
aVI'll just give that to you one more time.
p245
aa(lp246
VNow, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion?
p247
aVWhen an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist,
p248
aVsuggests a person \u2014 say, one of
p249
aVMarvin Minsky's little society of mind \u2014
p250
aVdo they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere?
p251
aVI don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done?
p252
aVWell, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?
p253
aVIt's the same thing.
p254
aVThe brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.
p255
aVYou think the detail's there, but it isn't there.
p256
aVThe brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.
p257
aVIt's just making you expect the detail.
p258
aa(lp259
VLet's just do this experiment very quickly.
p260
aVIs the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated?
p261
aVYes.
p262
aVHow many of you did it by rotating the one on the left
p263
aVin your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right?
p264
aVHow many of you rotated the one on the right? OK.
p265
aVHow do you know that's what you did?
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VThere's in fact been a very interesting debate
p270
aVraging for over 20 years in cognitive science \u2014
p271
aVvarious experiments started by Roger Shepherd,
p272
aVwho measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images.
p273
aVYes, it's possible to do that.
p274
aVBut the details of the process are still in significant controversy.
p275
aVAnd if you read that literature, one of the things
p276
aVthat you really have to come to terms with is
p277
aVeven when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know.
p278
aVYou don't know how you do it.
p279
aVYou just know that you have certain beliefs.
p280
aVAnd they come in a certain order, at a certain time.
p281
aVAnd what explains the fact that that's what you think?
p282
aVWell, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician.
p283
aa(lp284
VThis is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais.
p285
aVYou may think that I've cheated,
p286
aVthat I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there.
p287
aVHow many of you see that sort of boundary,
p288
aVwith the Necker cube floating in front of the circles?
p289
aVCan you see it?
p290
aVWell, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense.
p291
aVYour brain is actually computing that boundary,
p292
aVthe boundary that goes right there.
p293
aVBut now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right?
p294
aVIt's a Necker cube.
p295
aVEverybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK.
p296
aVCan you see the four ways of seeing the cube?
p297
aVBecause there's another way of seeing it.
p298
aVIf you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles,
p299
aVsome black circles, there's another way of seeing it.
p300
aVAs a cube, on a black background,
p301
aVas seen through a piece of Swiss cheese.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VCan you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VNow you can get it. These are two very different phenomena.
p310
aVWhen you see the cube one way, behind the screen,
p311
aVthose boundaries go away.
p312
aVBut there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this.
p313
aVWe don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change?
p314
aVDoes your brain have to send little painters in there?
p315
aVThe purple-painters and the green-painters
p316
aVfight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No.
p317
aVYour brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in.
p318
aVWhen I first started talking about
p319
aVthe Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw \u2014
p320
aVI'll go back to it, this one \u2014
p321
aVI said that there was no filling-in behind there.
p322
aVAnd I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true.
p323
aVBut Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't.
p324
aa(lp325
VNow, if you think you see some pale yellow \u2014
p326
aVI'll run this a few more times.
p327
aVLook in the gray areas,
p328
aVand see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there \u2014
p329
aVyeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.
p330
aV["Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes" slide]
p331
aVThis is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree
p332
aVinspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book.
p333
aVLet me just pause this for a second if I can.
p334
aa(lp335
VThis is change-blindness.
p336
aVWhat you're going to see is two pictures,
p337
aVone of which is slightly different from the other.
p338
aVYou see here the red roof and the gray roof,
p339
aVand in between them there will be a mask,
p340
aVwhich is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second.
p341
aVSo you'll see the first picture, then a mask,
p342
aVthen the second picture, then a mask.
p343
aVAnd this will just continue, and your job as the subject
p344
aVis to press the button when you see the change.
p345
aVSo, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.
p346
aVShow the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.
p347
aVAnd keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying,
p348
aV"I see the change."
p349
aa(lp350
VSo now we're going to be subjects in the experiment.
p351
aVWe're going to start easy. Some examples.
p352
aVNo trouble there.
p353
aVCan everybody see? All right.
p354
aVIndeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more
p355
aVthan a second to press the button.
p356
aVCan you see that one?
p357
aV2.9 seconds.
p358
aVHow many don't see it still?
p359
aVWhat's on the roof of that barn?
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VIt's easy.
p364
aVIs it a bridge or a dock?
p365
aVThere are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close.
p366
aVI want you to see a few that are particularly striking.
p367
aVThis one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see.
p368
aVCan you see it?
p369
aa(lp370
VAudience: Yes.
p371
aa(lp372
VDan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth? Pretty big.
p373
aVSo 15.5 seconds is the median time
p374
aVfor subjects in his experiment there.
p375
aa(lp376
VI love this one. I'll end with this one,
p377
aVjust because it's such an obvious and important thing.
p378
aVHow many still don't see it? How many still don't see it?
p379
aVHow many engines on the wing of that Boeing?
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VRight in the middle of the picture!
p384
aVThanks very much for your attention.
p385
aVWhat I wanted to show you is that scientists,
p386
aVusing their from-the-outside, third-person methods,
p387
aVcan tell you things about your own consciousness
p388
aVthat you would never dream of,
p389
aVand that, in fact, you're not the authority
p390
aVon your own consciousness that you think you are.
p391
aVAnd we're really making a lot of progress
p392
aVon coming up with a theory of mind.
p393
aa(lp394
VJeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt
p395
aVto get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience.
p396
aVAnd he's right. This is a problem.
p397
aVHarvard Medical School once \u2014 I was at a talk \u2014
p398
aVdirector of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying.
p399
aVIf you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience.
p400
aVIf you work on two neurons, that's psychology."
p401
aa(lp402
V(Laughter)
p403
aa(lp404
VWe have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down.
p405
aa(lp406
VThank you very much.
p407
aa(lp408
V(Applause)

He argues that the brain&#39;s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness &mdash; isn&#39;t. His 2003 book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; explores how our brains evolved to give  us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006&#39;s  &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot; examines belief through the lens of biology.<br /><br />This mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished Dennett&#39;s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology.

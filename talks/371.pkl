(lp4
VWhoa, dude.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VCheck out those killer equations. Sweet.
p9
aVActually, for the next 18 minutes I'm going to do the best I can
p10
aVto describe the beauty of particle physics without equations.
p11
aVIt turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral.
p12
aVA coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal.
p13
aVEach coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps.
p14
aVThese polyps are continually budding and branching
p15
aVinto genetically identical neighbors.
p16
aVIf we imagine this to be a hyperintelligent coral,
p17
aVwe can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question.
p18
aVWe can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location
p19
aVcompared to his neighbors \u2014
p20
aVif it was just chance, or destiny, or what?
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high,
p23
aVhe would tell us that our question was completely stupid.
p24
aVThese corals can be kind of mean, you see,
p25
aVand I have surfing scars to prove that.
p26
aVBut this polyp would continue and tell us
p27
aVthat his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him.
p28
aVThat he was in all these other locations as well,
p29
aVbut experiencing them as separate individuals.
p30
aVFor a coral, branching into different copies
p31
aVis the most natural thing in the world.
p32
aa(lp33
VUnlike us, a hyperintelligent coral
p34
aVwould be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics.
p35
aVThe mathematics of quantum mechanics
p36
aVvery accurately describes how our universe works.
p37
aVAnd it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities,
p38
aVjust like a coral.
p39
aVIt's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around,
p40
aVsince we only ever get to experience one possibility.
p41
aVThis quantum weirdness was first described
p42
aVby Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.
p43
aVThe cat likes this version better.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VIn this setup, Schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample
p48
aVthat, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state
p49
aVin which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VIn the branch in which the sample radiates,
p54
aVit sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schrödinger is dead.
p55
aVBut in the other branch of reality, he remains alive.
p56
aVThese realities are experienced separately by each individual.
p57
aVAs far as either can tell, the other one doesn't exist.
p58
aa(lp59
VThis seems weird to us,
p60
aVbecause each of us only experiences an individual existence,
p61
aVand we don't get to see other branches.
p62
aVIt's as if each of us, like Schrödinger here,
p63
aVare a kind of coral branching into different possibilities.
p64
aVThe mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us
p65
aVthis is how the world works at tiny scales.
p66
aVIt can be summed up in a single sentence:
p67
aVEverything that can happen, does.
p68
aVThat's quantum mechanics.
p69
aVBut this does not mean everything happens.
p70
aVThe rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can't.
p71
aVWhat physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry
p72
aVand the interactions of elementary particles.
p73
aVAnd things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles,
p76
aVwhat they are and how this balance works.
p77
aVIn this machine, a beam of protons and antiprotons
p78
aVare accelerated to near the speed of light
p79
aVand brought together in a collision, producing a burst of pure energy.
p80
aVThis energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles,
p81
aVwith detectors and computers used to figure out their properties.
p82
aVThis enormous machine \u2014
p83
aVthe Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva \u2014
p84
aVhas a circumference of 17 miles and, when it's operating,
p85
aVdraws five times as much power as the city of Monterey.
p86
aVWe can't predict specifically
p87
aVwhat particles will be produced in any individual collision.
p88
aVQuantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized.
p89
aVBut physics does tell us what particles can be produced.
p90
aVThese particles must have just as much mass and energy
p91
aVas is carried in by the proton and antiproton.
p92
aVAny particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced,
p93
aVand remain invisible to us.
p94
aVThis is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting.
p95
aVIt's going to push this energy limit seven times
p96
aVbeyond what's ever been done before,
p97
aVso we're going to get to see some new particles very soon.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut before talking about what we might see,
p100
aVlet me describe the particles we already know of.
p101
aVThere's a whole zoo of subatomic particles.
p102
aVMost of us are familiar with electrons.
p103
aVA lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VBut the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino,
p108
aVwith no electric charge and a very tiny mass.
p109
aVIn contrast, the up and down quarks have very large masses,
p110
aVand combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms.
p111
aVAll of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties,
p112
aVand have antiparticle partners that carry opposite charges.
p113
aVThese familiar particles
p114
aValso have less familiar second and third generations,
p115
aVwhich have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses.
p116
aVThese matter particles all interact with the various force particles.
p117
aVThe electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter
p118
aVvia particles called photons.
p119
aVThere is also a very weak force
p120
aVcalled, rather unimaginatively, the weak force ...
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
Vthat interacts only with left-handed matter.
p125
aVThe strong force acts between quarks
p126
aVwhich carry a different kind of charge, called color charge,
p127
aVand come in three different varieties: red, green and blue.
p128
aVYou can blame Murray Gell-Mann for these names \u2014 they're his fault.
p129
aVFinally, there's the force of gravity,
p130
aVwhich interacts with matter via its mass and spin.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe most important thing to understand here
p133
aVis that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces.
p134
aVThese four different forces interact with matter
p135
aVaccording to the corresponding charges that each particle has.
p136
aVA particle that hasn't been seen yet, but we're pretty sure exists,
p137
aVis the Higgs particle, which gives masses to all these other particles.
p138
aVThe main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider
p139
aVis to see this Higgs particle, and we're almost certain it will.
p140
aVBut the greatest mystery is what else we might see.
p141
aVAnd I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility
p142
aVtowards the end of this talk.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow, if we count up all these different particles
p145
aVusing their various spins and charges,
p146
aVthere are 226.
p147
aVThat's a lot of particles to keep track of.
p148
aVAnd it seems strange
p149
aVthat nature would have so many elementary particles.
p150
aVBut if we plot them out according to their charges,
p151
aVsome beautiful patterns emerge.
p152
aVThe most familiar charge is electric charge.
p153
aVElectrons have an electric charge,
p154
aVa negative one,
p155
aVand quarks have electric charges in thirds.
p156
aVSo when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton,
p157
aVit has a total electric charge of plus one.
p158
aVThese particles also have antiparticles, which have opposite charges.
p159
aVNow, it turns out the electric charge
p160
aVis actually a combination of two other charges:
p161
aVhypercharge and weak charge.
p162
aVIf we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge
p163
aVand plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space,
p164
aVthe electric charge is where these particles sit
p165
aValong the vertical direction.
p166
aVThe electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter
p167
aVaccording to their hypercharge and weak charge,
p168
aVwhich make this pattern.
p169
aVThis is called the unified electroweak model,
p170
aVand it was put together back in 1967.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge
p173
aVand not both of these is because of the Higgs particle.
p174
aVThe Higgs, over here on the left, has a large mass
p175
aVand breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern.
p176
aVIt makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass.
p177
aVSince this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram,
p178
aVthe photons of electromagnetism remain massless
p179
aVand interact with electric charge along the vertical direction
p180
aVin this charge space.
p181
aVSo the electromagnetic and weak forces
p182
aVare described by this pattern of particle charges
p183
aVin two-dimensional space.
p184
aVWe can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions
p185
aVand plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks
p186
aValong these directions.
p187
aVThe charges of all known particles
p188
aVcan be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space,
p189
aVand projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them.
p190
aa(lp191
VWhenever particles interact, nature keeps things in a perfect balance
p192
aValong all four of these charge directions.
p193
aVIf a particle and an antiparticle collide,
p194
aVit creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero
p195
aVin all four charge directions.
p196
aVAt this point, anything can be created
p197
aVas long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero.
p198
aVFor example, this weak force particle and its antiparticle
p199
aVcan be created in a collision.
p200
aVIn further interactions, the charges must always balance.
p201
aVOne of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an antineutrino,
p202
aVand these three still add to zero total charge.
p203
aVNature always keeps a perfect balance.
p204
aVSo these patterns of charges are not just pretty.
p205
aVThey tell us what interactions are allowed to happen.
p206
aVAnd we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions
p207
aVto get a better look at the strong interaction,
p208
aVwhich has this nice hexagonal symmetry.
p209
aVIn a strong interaction, a strong force particle,
p210
aVsuch as this one,
p211
aVinteracts with a colored quark, such as this green one,
p212
aVto give a quark with a different color charge \u2014 this red one.
p213
aVAnd strong interactions are happening millions of times
p214
aVeach second in every atom of our bodies,
p215
aVholding the atomic nuclei together.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut these four charges corresponding to three forces
p218
aVare not the end of the story.
p219
aVWe can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force.
p220
aVWhen we include these,
p221
aVeach matter particle has two different spin charges,
p222
aVspin-up and spin-down.
p223
aVSo they all split and give a nice pattern in six-dimensional charge space.
p224
aVWe can rotate this pattern in six dimensions
p225
aVand see that it's quite pretty.
p226
aVRight now, this pattern matches our best current knowledge
p227
aVof how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles.
p228
aVThis is what we know for certain.
p229
aVSome of these particles are at the very limit
p230
aVof what we've been able to reach with experiments.
p231
aVFrom this pattern
p232
aVwe already know the particle physics of these tiny scales \u2014
p233
aVthe way the universe works at these tiny scales is very beautiful.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas
p236
aVabout things we don't know yet.
p237
aVWe want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone,
p238
aVand see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada.
p239
aVWe want to find all the particles and forces
p240
aVthat make a complete picture of our universe.
p241
aVAnd we want to use this picture to predict new particles
p242
aVthat we'll see when experiments reach higher energies.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo there's an old idea in particle physics
p245
aVthat this known pattern of charges,
p246
aVwhich is not very symmetric,
p247
aVcould emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken \u2014
p248
aVsimilar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern
p249
aVto give electromagnetism.
p250
aVIn order to do this, we need to introduce new forces
p251
aVwith new charge directions.
p252
aVWhen we introduce a new direction,
p253
aVwe get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction,
p254
aVand then we can rotate it in with the others.
p255
aVIf we guess wisely, we can construct the standard charges
p256
aVin six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry
p257
aVof this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions.
p258
aa(lp259
VThis particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory
p260
aVintroduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.
p261
aVWhen we look at this new unified pattern,
p262
aVwe can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing.
p263
aVThis is the way theories of unification work.
p264
aVA physicist looks for larger, more symmetric patterns
p265
aVthat include the established pattern as a subset.
p266
aVThe larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles
p267
aVthat have never been seen.
p268
aVThis unification model predicts the existence
p269
aVof these two new force particles,
p270
aVwhich should act a lot like the weak force, only weaker.
p271
aa(lp272
VNow, we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions
p273
aVand consider an odd fact about the matter particles:
p274
aVthe second and third generations of matter
p275
aVhave exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space
p276
aVas the first generation.
p277
aVThese particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges.
p278
aVThey sit on top of one another in the standard charge space.
p279
aVHowever, if we work in eight-dimensional charge space,
p280
aVthen we can assign unique new charges to each particle.
p281
aVThen we can spin these in eight dimensions
p282
aVand see what the whole pattern looks like.
p283
aVHere we can see the second and third generations of matter now,
p284
aVrelated to the first generation by a symmetry called "triality."
p285
aa(lp286
VThis particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions
p287
aVis actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics.
p288
aVIt's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8.
p289
aVThis Lie group is a smooth, curved shape with 248 dimensions.
p290
aVEach point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry
p291
aVof this very complex and beautiful shape.
p292
aVOne small part of this E8 shape can be used to describe
p293
aVthe curved space-time of Einstein's general relativity,
p294
aVexplaining gravity.
p295
aVTogether with quantum mechanics,
p296
aVthe geometry of this shape could describe everything
p297
aVabout how the universe works at the tiniest scales.
p298
aVThe pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space
p299
aVis exquisitely beautiful,
p300
aVand it summarizes thousands of possible interactions
p301
aVbetween these elementary particles,
p302
aVeach of which is just a facet of this complicated shape.
p303
aa(lp304
VAs we spin it, we can see many of the other intricate patterns
p305
aVcontained in this one.
p306
aVAnd with a particular rotation,
p307
aVwe can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis
p308
aVand see all the particles at once.
p309
aVIt's a very beautiful object,
p310
aVand as with any unification,
p311
aVwe can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern.
p312
aVThere are 20 gaps where new particles should be,
p313
aVtwo of which have been filled by the Pati-Salam particles.
p314
aVFrom their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles
p315
aVshould be scalar fields like the Higgs particle,
p316
aVbut have color charge and interact with the strong force.
p317
aVFilling in these new particles completes this pattern,
p318
aVgiving us the full E8.
p319
aa(lp320
VThis E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots.
p321
aVIt's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics.
p322
aVIt's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty
p323
aVcould describe the truth of particle interactions
p324
aVat the smallest scales imaginable.
p325
aVAnd this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new.
p326
aVIn 1623, Galileo wrote this:
p327
aV"Nature's grand book, which stands continually open to our gaze,
p328
aVis written in the language of mathematics.
p329
aVIts characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures,
p330
aVwithout which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it;
p331
aVwithout these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth."
p332
aa(lp333
VI believe this to be true,
p334
aVand I've tried to follow Galileo's guidance
p335
aVin describing the mathematics of particle physics
p336
aVusing only triangles, circles and other geometrical figures.
p337
aVOf course, when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff,
p338
aVthe mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth.
p339
aVBut it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics
p340
aVis pure, beautiful geometry.
p341
aVJoined with quantum mechanics,
p342
aVthis mathematics describes our universe as a growing E8 coral,
p343
aVwith particles interacting at every location in all possible ways
p344
aVaccording to a beautiful pattern.
p345
aVAnd as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines
p346
aVlike the Large Hadron Collider,
p347
aVwe may be able to see whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one.
p348
aa(lp349
VThis process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in.
p350
aVIf the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern,
p351
aVthat will be very, very cool.
p352
aVIf the LHC finds new particles, but they don't fit this pattern \u2014
p353
aVwell, that will be very interesting, but bad for this E8 theory.
p354
aVAnd, of course, bad for me personally.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VNow, how bad would that be?
p359
aVWell, pretty bad.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VBut predicting how nature works is a very risky game.
p364
aVThis theory and others like it are long shots.
p365
aVOne does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas
p366
aVprobably won't end up being true about nature.
p367
aVThat's what doing theoretical physics is like:
p368
aVthere are a lot of wipeouts.
p369
aVIn this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies.
p370
aVAs with any large investment,
p371
aVit can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research
p372
aVwhen it isn't working out.
p373
aVBut in science, if something isn't working,
p374
aVyou have to toss it out and try something else.
p375
aa(lp376
VNow, the only way to maintain sanity
p377
aVand achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty
p378
aVis to keep balance and perspective in life.
p379
aVI've tried the best I can to live a balanced life.
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VI try to balance my life equally between physics, love and surfing \u2014
p384
aVmy own three charge directions.
p385
aa(lp386
V(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
VThis way, even if the physics I work on comes to nothing,
p389
aVI still know I've lived a good life.
p390
aVAnd I try to live in beautiful places.
p391
aVFor most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui,
p392
aVa very beautiful place.
p393
aVNow, it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents
p394
aVhow I managed to survive all that time
p395
aVwithout engaging in anything resembling full-time employment.
p396
aa(lp397
V(Laughter)
p398
aa(lp399
VI'm going to let you in on that secret.
p400
aVThis was a view from my home office on Maui.
p401
aVAnd this is another,
p402
aVand another.
p403
aVAnd you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar,
p404
aVbut in slightly different places.
p405
aVThat's because this used to be my home and office on Maui.
p406
aa(lp407
V(Laughter)
p408
aa(lp409
VI've chosen a very unusual life.
p410
aVBut not worrying about rent
p411
aVallowed me to spend my time doing what I love.
p412
aVLiving a nomadic existence has been hard at times,
p413
aVbut it's allowed me to live in beautiful places
p414
aVand keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with.
p415
aVIt allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyperintelligent coral.
p416
aVBut I also greatly enjoy the company of hyperintelligent people.
p417
aVSo I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED.
p418
aa(lp419
VThank you very much.
p420
aa(lp421
V(Applause)
p422
aa(lp423
VChris Anderson: Stay here one second.
p424
aa(lp425
V(Applause)
p426
aa(lp427
VI probably understood two percent of that,
p428
aVbut I still absolutely loved it.
p429
aVSo I'm going to sound dumb.
p430
aVYour theory of everything \u2014
p431
aa(lp432
VGarrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.
p433
aa(lp434
VCA: That's right.
p435
aVThe reason it's got a few people at least excited
p436
aVis because, if you're right, it brings gravity and quantum theory together.
p437
aVSo are you saying that we should think of the universe, at its heart \u2014
p438
aVthat the smallest things that there are,
p439
aVare somehow an E8 object of possibility?
p440
aVI mean, is there a scale to it, at the smallest scale, or ...?
p441
aa(lp442
VGL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you
p443
aVthat corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics \u2014
p444
aVthat already corresponds to a very beautiful shape.
p445
aVAnd that's the one that I said we knew for certain.
p446
aVAnd that shape has remarkable similarities \u2014
p447
aVand the way it fits into this E8 pattern, which could be the rest of the picture.
p448
aVAnd these patterns of points that I've shown for you
p449
aVactually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object
p450
aVthat would be warping and moving and dancing
p451
aVover the space-time that we experience.
p452
aVAnd that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see.
p453
aa(lp454
VCA: But a string theorist, as I understand it,
p455
aVexplains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating \u2014
p456
aVI know, you don't like string theory \u2014 vibrating inside it.
p457
aVHow should we think of an electron in relation to E8?
p458
aa(lp459
VGL: Well, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
p460
aVSo what's happening is, as the shape is moving over space-time, it's twisting.
p461
aVAnd the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see.
p462
aVSo it would be \u2014
p463
aa(lp464
VCA: The size of the E8 shape, how does that relate to the electron?
p465
aVI feel like I need that for my picture. Is it bigger? Is it smaller?
p466
aa(lp467
VGL: As far as we know, electrons are point particles,
p468
aVso this would be going down to the smallest possible scales.
p469
aVSo the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is,
p470
aVall possibilities are expanding and developing at once.
p471
aVAnd this is why I use the analogy to coral.
p472
aVAnd \u2014
p473
aVin this way, the way that E8 comes in
p474
aVis it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in the space-time.
p475
aVAnd, as I said, the way the shape twists \u2014
p476
aVthe directional along which way the shape is twisting
p477
aVas it moves over this curved surface \u2014
p478
aVis what the elementary particles are, themselves.
p479
aVSo through quantum field theory,
p480
aVthey manifest themselves as points and interact that way.
p481
aVI don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer.
p482
aa(lp483
V(Laughter)
p484
aa(lp485
VCA: It doesn't really matter.
p486
aVIt's evoking a kind of sense of wonder,
p487
aVand I certainly want to understand more of this.
p488
aa(lp489
VBut thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating.

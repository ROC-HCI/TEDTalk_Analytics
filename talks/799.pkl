VI'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
p5
aVI've been making games online now for 10 years,
p6
aVand my goal for the next decade
p7
aVis to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life
p8
aVas it is to save the world in online games.
p9
aVNow, I have a plan for this,
p10
aVand it entails convincing more people,
p11
aVincluding all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better games.
p12
aa(lp13
VRight now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games.
p14
aVSome of you might be thinking,
p15
aV"That's a lot of time to spend playing games.
p16
aVMaybe too much time,
p17
aVconsidering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world."
p18
aVBut actually, according to my research at the Institute for the Future,
p19
aVactually the opposite is true.
p20
aVThree billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play
p21
aVto solve the world's most urgent problems.
p22
aa(lp23
VIn fact, I believe that if we want to survive
p24
aVthe next century on this planet,
p25
aVwe need to increase that total dramatically.
p26
aVI've calculated the total we need
p27
aVat 21 billion hours of game play every week.
p28
aVSo, that's probably a bit of a counter-intuitive idea,
p29
aVso I'll say it again, let it sink in:
p30
aVIf we want to solve problems like hunger,
p31
aVpoverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity,
p32
aVI believe that we need to aspire to play games online
p33
aVfor at least 21 billion hours a week, by the end of the next decade.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VNo. I'm serious. I am.
p38
aa(lp39
VHere's why.
p40
aVThis picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential
p41
aVto the future survival of the human species.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VTruly.
p46
aVThis is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano.
p47
aVHe wanted to capture the emotion of gaming,
p48
aVso he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing.
p49
aVAnd this is a classic gaming emotion.
p50
aVNow, if you're not a gamer,
p51
aVyou might miss some of the nuance in this photo.
p52
aVYou probably see the sense of urgency,
p53
aVa little bit of fear, but intense concentration,
p54
aVdeep, deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem.
p55
aa(lp56
VIf you are a gamer, you will notice a few nuances here:
p57
aVthe crinkle of the eyes up, and around the mouth
p58
aVis a sign of optimism,
p59
aVand the eyebrows up is surprise.
p60
aVThis is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an "epic win."
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VOh, you've heard of that.
p65
aVOK, good, so we have some gamers among us.
p66
aVAn epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive,
p67
aVyou had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it.
p68
aVIt was almost beyond the threshold of imagination, and when you get there,
p69
aVyou're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of.
p70
aVThat's an epic win.
p71
aVThis is a gamer on the verge of an epic win.
p72
aVAnd this is the face that we need to see
p73
aVon millions of problem-solvers all over the world
p74
aVas we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century \u2014
p75
aVthe face of someone who, against all odds,
p76
aVis on the verge of an epic win.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, unfortunately this is more of the face that we see
p79
aVin everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems.
p80
aVThis is what I call the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.
p81
aVThis is actually me making it.
p82
aVCan you see? Yes. Good.
p83
aVThis is me making the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.
p84
aVThis is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood
p85
aVin Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD
p86
aVon why we're better in games than we are in real life.
p87
aVAnd this is a problem that a lot of gamers have.
p88
aVWe feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games.
p89
aa(lp90
VI don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it.
p91
aVWe do achieve more in game worlds.
p92
aVBut I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters \u2014
p93
aVinspired to collaborate and to cooperate.
p94
aVAnd when we're in game worlds,
p95
aVI believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves \u2014
p96
aVthe most likely to help at a moment's notice,
p97
aVthe most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes,
p98
aVto get up after failure and try again.
p99
aVAnd in real life, when we face failure,
p100
aVwhen we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way.
p101
aVWe feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,
p102
aVwe feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical.
p103
aVWe never have those feelings when we're playing games,
p104
aVthey just don't exist in games.
p105
aVSo that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student.
p106
aa(lp107
VWhat about games makes it impossible
p108
aVto feel that we can't achieve everything?
p109
aVHow can we take those feelings from games
p110
aVand apply them to real-world work?
p111
aVSo I looked at games like World of Warcraft,
p112
aVwhich is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment.
p113
aVAnd I started to notice a few things
p114
aVthat make epic wins so possible in online worlds.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games,
p117
aVespecially in World of Warcraft,
p118
aVthere are lots and lots of different characters
p119
aVwho are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away.
p120
aVBut not just any mission,
p121
aVit's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game.
p122
aVRight? So you can do it.
p123
aVThey never give you a challenge you can't achieve.
p124
aVBut it is on the verge of what you're capable of,
p125
aVso you have to try hard.
p126
aVBut there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft; no sitting around,
p127
aVwringing your hands \u2014
p128
aVthere's always something specific and important to be done.
p129
aVThere are also tons of collaborators.
p130
aVEverywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people
p131
aVready to work with you to achieve your epic mission.
p132
aa(lp133
VThat's not something we have in real life that easily,
p134
aVthis sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators.
p135
aVAnd there's this epic story, this inspiring story of why we're there,
p136
aVand what we're doing,
p137
aVand we get all this positive feedback.
p138
aVYou guys have heard of leveling up, +1 strength, +1 intelligence.
p139
aVWe don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.
p140
aVWhen I get off this stage,
p141
aVI'm not going to have +1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,
p142
aV+20 crazy idea.
p143
aVI don't get that feedback in real life.
p144
aa(lp145
VNow, the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft
p146
aVis that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time,
p147
aVwe decide to spend all our time in these game worlds.
p148
aVIt's just better than reality.
p149
aVSo, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers
p150
aVhave spent 5.93 million years
p151
aVsolving the virtual problems of Azeroth.
p152
aVNow, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
p153
aVIt might sound like it's a bad thing.
p154
aVBut to put that in context:
p155
aV5.93 million years ago
p156
aVwas when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up.
p157
aVThat was the first upright primate.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo when we talk about how much time
p160
aVwe're currently investing in playing games,
p161
aVthe only way it makes sense to even think about it
p162
aVis to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution,
p163
aVwhich is an extraordinary thing.
p164
aVBut it's also apt,
p165
aVbecause it turns out that by spending all this time playing games,
p166
aVwe're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings.
p167
aVWe're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species.
p168
aVThis is true. I believe this.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo, consider this really interesting statistic;
p171
aVit was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University:
p172
aVThe average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture
p173
aVwill have spent 10,000 hours playing online games
p174
aVby the age of 21.
p175
aVNow 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons.
p176
aVFirst of all, for children in the United States,
p177
aV10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school,
p178
aVfrom fifth grade to high school graduation,
p179
aVif you have perfect attendance.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VSo, we have an entire parallel track of education going on,
p184
aVwhere young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer
p185
aVas they're learning about everything else in school.
p186
aVSome of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book "Outliers,"
p187
aVso you would have heard of his theory of success,
p188
aVthe "10,000 hours" theory of success.
p189
aVIt's based on this great cognitive-science research
p190
aVthat says if we can master 10,000 hours
p191
aVof effortful study at anything by the age of 21,
p192
aVwe will be virtuosos at it.
p193
aVWe will be as good at whatever we do
p194
aVas the greatest people in the world.
p195
aVAnd so, now what we're looking at
p196
aVis an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo, the big question is,
p199
aV"What exactly are gamers getting so good at?"
p200
aVBecause if we could figure that out,
p201
aVwe would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands.
p202
aVThis is how many people we now have in the world
p203
aVwho spend at least an hour a day playing online games.
p204
aVThese are our virtuoso gamers,
p205
aV500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something.
p206
aVAnd in the next decade,
p207
aVwe're going to have another billion gamers
p208
aVwho are extraordinarily good at whatever that is.
p209
aVIf you don't know it already, this is coming.
p210
aVThe game industry is developing consoles
p211
aVthat are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks
p212
aVinstead of broadband Internet,
p213
aVso that gamers all over the world,
p214
aVparticularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online.
p215
aVThey expect one billion more gamers in the next decade.
p216
aVIt will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo I've started to think about
p219
aVwhat these games are making us virtuosos at.
p220
aVHere are the four things I came up with.
p221
aVThe first is urgent optimism.
p222
aVOK, think of this as extreme self-motivation.
p223
aVUrgent optimism is the desire to act immediately
p224
aVto tackle an obstacle,
p225
aVcombined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success.
p226
aVGamers always believe that an epic win is possible,
p227
aVand that it's always worth trying, and trying now.
p228
aVGamers don't sit around.
p229
aVGamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric.
p230
aVThere's a lot of interesting research that shows
p231
aVwe like people better after we play a game with them,
p232
aVeven if they've beaten us badly.
p233
aVAnd the reason is, it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone.
p234
aVWe trust that they will spend their time with us,
p235
aVthat they will play by the same rules,
p236
aVvalue the same goal, stay with the game until it's over.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd so, playing a game together
p239
aVactually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation.
p240
aVAnd we actually build stronger social relationships as a result.
p241
aVBlissful productivity. I love it.
p242
aVYou know, there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer
p243
aVplays for 22 hours a week \u2014 kind of a half-time job.
p244
aVIt's because we know, when we're playing a game,
p245
aVthat we're actually happier working hard
p246
aVthan we are relaxing, or hanging out.
p247
aVWe know that we are optimized as human beings,
p248
aVto do hard and meaningful work.
p249
aVAnd gamers are willing to work hard all the time,
p250
aVif they're given the right work.
p251
aa(lp252
VFinally: epic meaning.
p253
aVGamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions
p254
aVto human planetary-scale stories.
p255
aVSo, just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective:
p256
aVSo, you all know Wikipedia, biggest wiki in the world.
p257
aVSecond biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles,
p258
aVis the World of Warcraft wiki.
p259
aVFive million people use it every month.
p260
aVThey have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet
p261
aVthan any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world.
p262
aVThey are building an epic story.
p263
aVThey are building an epic knowledge resource
p264
aVabout the World of Warcraft.
p265
aa(lp266
VOkay, so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing:
p267
aVGamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals.
p268
aVThese are people who believe that they are individually capable
p269
aVof changing the world.
p270
aVAnd the only problem is,
p271
aVthey believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds
p272
aVand not the real world.
p273
aVThat's the problem that I'm trying to solve.
p274
aa(lp275
VThere's an economist named Edward Castronova.
p276
aVHis work is brilliant.
p277
aVHe looks at why people are investing so much time and energy
p278
aVand money in online worlds.
p279
aVAnd he says,
p280
aV"We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus
p281
aVto virtual worlds and online game environments."
p282
aVAnd he's an economist, so he's rational.
p283
aVAnd he says \u2014
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VNot like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant.
p288
aVBut he says that this makes perfect sense,
p289
aVbecause gamers can achieve more in online worlds
p290
aVthan they can in real life.
p291
aVThey can have stronger social relationships in games
p292
aVthan they can have in real life;
p293
aVthey get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games
p294
aVthan they do in real life.
p295
aVSo he says, for now it makes perfect sense
p296
aVfor gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world.
p297
aVNow, I also agree that that is rational, for now.
p298
aVBut it is not, by any means, an optimal situation.
p299
aVWe have to start making the real world work more like a game.
p300
aa(lp301
VI take my inspiration from something that happened
p302
aV2,500 years ago.
p303
aVThese are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles.
p304
aVBefore we had awesome game controllers,
p305
aVwe had sheep's knuckles.
p306
aVAnd these represent the first game equipment
p307
aVdesigned by human beings,
p308
aVand if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,
p309
aVyou might know this history,
p310
aVwhich is the history of who invented games and why.
p311
aVHerodotus says that games, particularly dice games,
p312
aVwere invented in the kingdom of Lydia,
p313
aVduring a time of famine.
p314
aa(lp315
VApparently, there was such a severe famine
p316
aVthat the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy.
p317
aVPeople were suffering. People were fighting.
p318
aVIt was an extreme situation, they needed an extreme solution.
p319
aVSo, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games,
p320
aVand they set up a kingdom-wide policy:
p321
aVOn one day, everybody would eat,
p322
aVand on the next day, everybody would play games.
p323
aVAnd they would be so immersed in playing the dice games,
p324
aVbecause games are so engaging,
p325
aVand immerse us in such satisfying, blissful productivity,
p326
aVthey would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat.
p327
aVAnd then on the next day, they would play games;
p328
aVand on the next day, they would eat.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd according to Herodotus,
p331
aVthey passed 18 years this way,
p332
aVsurviving through a famine,
p333
aVby eating on one day, and playing games on the next.
p334
aVNow, this is exactly, I think, how we're using games today.
p335
aVWe're using games to escape real-world suffering \u2014
p336
aVwe're using games to get away
p337
aVfrom everything that's broken in the real environment,
p338
aVeverything that's not satisfying about real life,
p339
aVand we're getting what we need from games.
p340
aa(lp341
VBut it doesn't have to end there.
p342
aVThis is really exciting.
p343
aVAccording to Herodotus, after 18 years the famine wasn't getting better,
p344
aVso the king decided they would play one final dice game.
p345
aVThey divided the entire kingdom in half.
p346
aVThey played one dice game,
p347
aVand the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure.
p348
aVThey would leave Lydia,
p349
aVand they would go out in search of a new place to live,
p350
aVleaving behind just enough people
p351
aVto survive on the resources that were available,
p352
aVand hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow, this sounds crazy, right?
p355
aVBut recently, DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans,
p356
aVwho then led to the Roman Empire,
p357
aVactually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians.
p358
aVAnd so, recently, scientists have suggested
p359
aVthat Herodotus' crazy story is actually true.
p360
aVAnd geologists have found evidence of a global cooling
p361
aVthat lasted for nearly 20 years, that could have explained the famine.
p362
aVSo this crazy story might be true.
p363
aVThey might have actually saved their culture by playing games,
p364
aVescaping to games for 18 years,
p365
aVand then been so inspired,
p366
aVand knew so much about how to come together with games,
p367
aVthat they actually saved the entire civilization that way.
p368
aa(lp369
VOkay, we can do that.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
VWe've been playing Warcraft since 1994.
p374
aVThat was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series.
p375
aVThat was 16 years ago.
p376
aVThey played dice games for 18 years,
p377
aVwe've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.
p378
aVI say we are ready for our own epic game.
p379
aVNow, they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world,
p380
aVso that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from.
p381
aVLet's get half of us to agree
p382
aVto spend an hour a day playing games,
p383
aVuntil we solve real-world problems.
p384
aa(lp385
VNow, I know you're asking,
p386
aV"How are we going to solve real-world problems in games?"
p387
aVWell, that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years,
p388
aVat the Institute for the Future.
p389
aVWe have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto,
p390
aVand it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future.
p391
aVWe do not want to try to predict the future.
p392
aVWhat we want to do is make the future.
p393
aVWe want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome,
p394
aVand then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality.
p395
aVWe want to imagine epic wins,
p396
aVand then give people the means to achieve the epic win.
p397
aa(lp398
VI'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made
p399
aVthat are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins
p400
aVin their own futures.
p401
aVThis is World Without Oil.
p402
aVWe made this game in 2007.
p403
aVThis is an online game
p404
aVin which you try to survive an oil shortage.
p405
aVThe oil shortage is fictional,
p406
aVbut we put enough online content out there
p407
aVfor you to believe that it's real,
p408
aVand to live your real life as if we've run out of oil.
p409
aVSo when you come to the game,
p410
aVyou sign up, tell us where you live,
p411
aVand then we give you real-time news videos,
p412
aVdata feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs,
p413
aVwhat's not available, how food supply is being affected,
p414
aVhow transportation is being affected,
p415
aVif schools are closed, if there's rioting,
p416
aVand you have to figure out how you would live your real life
p417
aVas if this were true.
p418
aVAnd then we ask you to blog about it,
p419
aVto post videos, to post photos.
p420
aa(lp421
VWe piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007,
p422
aVand we've tracked them for the three years since.
p423
aVAnd I can tell you that this is a transformative experience.
p424
aVNobody wants to change how they live,
p425
aVjust because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to.
p426
aVBut if you immerse them in an epic adventure
p427
aVand tell them, "We've run out of oil.
p428
aVThis is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on.
p429
aVChallenge yourself to see how you would survive,"
p430
aVmost of our players have kept up the habits
p431
aVthat they learned in this game.
p432
aa(lp433
VSo for the next world-saving game,
p434
aVwe decided to aim higher \u2014 bigger problem than just peak oil.
p435
aVWe did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future.
p436
aVAnd the premise was, a supercomputer has calculated
p437
aVthat humans have only 23 years left on the planet.
p438
aVThis supercomputer was called
p439
aVthe Global Extinction Awareness System, of course.
p440
aVWe asked people to come online \u2014
p441
aValmost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
p442
aVYou know Jerry Bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team \u2014
p443
aVyou've got the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-convict,
p444
aVand they all have something to do to save the world.
p445
aa(lp446
V(Laughter)
p447
aa(lp448
VBut in our game, instead of just having five people on the dream team,
p449
aVwe said, "Everybody's on the dream team,
p450
aVand it's your job to invent the future of energy,
p451
aVthe future of food, the future of health,
p452
aVthe future of security and the future of the social safety net."
p453
aVWe had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks.
p454
aVThey came up with 500 insanely creative solutions
p455
aVthat you can go online, Google "Superstruct," and see.
p456
aa(lp457
VSo, finally, the last game,
p458
aVwe're launching it March 3rd.
p459
aVThis is a game done with the World Bank Institute.
p460
aVIf you complete the game,
p461
aVyou will be certified by the World Bank Institute
p462
aVas a Social Innovator, class of 2010.
p463
aVWorking with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa,
p464
aVand we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills.
p465
aVWe've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up
p466
aVin skills like local insight, knowledge networking,
p467
aVsustainability, vision and resourcefulness.
p468
aVI would like to invite all of you
p469
aVto please share this game with young people,
p470
aVanywhere in the world, particularly in developing areas,
p471
aVwho might benefit from coming together
p472
aVto try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world.
p473
aa(lp474
VSo, I'm going to wrap up now.
p475
aVI want to ask a question.
p476
aVWhat do you think happens next?
p477
aVWe've got all these amazing gamers, we've got these games
p478
aVthat are kind of pilots of what we might do,
p479
aVbut none of them have saved the real world yet.
p480
aVWell I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource
p481
aVthat we can use to do real-world work,
p482
aVthat games are a powerful platform for change.
p483
aVWe have all these amazing superpowers:
p484
aVblissful productivity, the ability to weave a tight social fabric,
p485
aVthis feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning.
p486
aa(lp487
VI really hope that we can come together to play games that matter,
p488
aVto survive on this planet for another century.
p489
aVThat's my hope, that you will join me in making and playing games like this.
p490
aVWhen I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for sure:
p491
aVthat we can make any future we can imagine,
p492
aVand we can play any games we want, so I say:
p493
aVLet the world-changing games begin.
p494
aa(lp495
VThank you.
p496
aa(lp497
V(Applause)

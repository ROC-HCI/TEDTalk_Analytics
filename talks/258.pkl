VI love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one.
p5
aVWe all know the Earth is in trouble.
p6
aVWe have now entered in the 6X,
p7
aVthe sixth major extinction on this planet.
p8
aVI often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms \u2014
p9
aVotherwise known as "Uh-Oh" \u2014
p10
aV(Laughter) \u2014 and every organism had a right to vote,
p11
aVwould we be voted on the planet, or off the planet?
p12
aVI think that vote is occurring right now.
p13
aa(lp14
VI want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions,
p15
aVusing fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium.
p16
aVThe mycelium infuses all landscapes,
p17
aVit holds soils together, it's extremely tenacious.
p18
aVThis holds up to 30,000 times its mass.
p19
aVThey're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature \u2014 the soil magicians.
p20
aVThey generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth.
p21
aVWe have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer
p22
aVof nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium \u2014
p23
aVso the mycelium is the mother
p24
aVthat is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees
p25
aVto hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs.
p26
aa(lp27
VDusty and I, we like to say, on Sunday, this is where we go to church.
p28
aVI'm in love with the old-growth forest,
p29
aVand I'm a patriotic American because we have those.
p30
aVMost of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.
p31
aVAnd frankly, I face a big obstacle.
p32
aVWhen I mention mushrooms to somebody,
p33
aVthey immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms,
p34
aVtheir eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy.
p35
aVSo, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group.
p36
aVWe call it mycophobia,
p37
aVthe irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi.
p38
aa(lp39
VMushrooms are very fast in their growth.
p40
aVDay 21, day 23, day 25.
p41
aVMushrooms produce strong antibiotics.
p42
aVIn fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom.
p43
aVA group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists
p44
aVpublished a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta \u2014
p45
aVa super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together.
p46
aVWe share in common the same pathogens.
p47
aVFungi don't like to rot from bacteria,
p48
aVand so our best antibiotics come from fungi.
p49
aVBut here is a mushroom that's past its prime.
p50
aVAfter they sporulate, they do rot.
p51
aVBut I propose to you that the sequence of microbes
p52
aVthat occur on rotting mushrooms
p53
aVare essential for the health of the forest.
p54
aVThey give rise to the trees,
p55
aVthey create the debris fields that feed the mycelium.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd so we see a mushroom here sporulating.
p58
aVAnd the spores are germinating,
p59
aVand the mycelium forms and goes underground.
p60
aVIn a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.
p61
aVMy foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.
p62
aa(lp63
VThis is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.
p64
aVAnd notice that as the mycelium grows,
p65
aVit conquers territory and then it begins the net.
p66
aVI've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years,
p67
aVI have thousands of electron micrographs,
p68
aVand when I'm staring at the mycelium,
p69
aVI realize that they are microfiltration membranes.
p70
aVWe exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.
p71
aVIt inhales oxygen, just like we do.
p72
aVBut these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs.
p73
aVAnd I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.
p74
aVAnd in these cavities, these micro-cavities form,
p75
aVand as they fuse soils, they absorb water.
p76
aVThese are little wells.
p77
aVAnd inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form.
p78
aVAnd so the spongy soil not only resists erosion,
p79
aVbut sets up a microbial universe
p80
aVthat gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.
p81
aa(lp82
VI first proposed, in the early 1990s,
p83
aVthat mycelium is Earth's natural Internet.
p84
aVWhen you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.
p85
aVAnd if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly,
p86
aVbecause of the nodes of crossing \u2014
p87
aVInternet engineers maybe call them hot points \u2014
p88
aVthere are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.
p89
aVThe mycelium is sentient.
p90
aVIt knows that you are there.
p91
aVWhen you walk across landscapes,
p92
aVit leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.
p93
aVSo, I believe the invention of the computer Internet
p94
aVis an inevitable consequence
p95
aVof a previously proven, biologically successful model.
p96
aVThe Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit,
p97
aVand we now, being the top organism on this planet,
p98
aVare trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere.
p99
aa(lp100
VGoing way out, dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype.
p101
aVI believe matter begets life;
p102
aVlife becomes single cells; single cells become strings;
p103
aVstrings become chains; chains network.
p104
aVAnd this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe.
p105
aa(lp106
VMost of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land.
p107
aVThey came to land 1.3 billion years ago,
p108
aVand plants followed several hundred million years later.
p109
aVHow is that possible?
p110
aVIt's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids,
p111
aVand many other acids and enzymes,
p112
aVpockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals
p113
aVand forming calcium oxalates.
p114
aVMakes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil.
p115
aVOxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together.
p116
aVSo, fungi and mycelium
p117
aVsequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates.
p118
aVAnd all sorts of other oxalates
p119
aVare also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals
p120
aVthat are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix.
p121
aa(lp122
VThis was first discovered in 1859.
p123
aVThis is a photograph by Franz Hueber.
p124
aVThis photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.
p125
aV420 million years ago, this organism existed.
p126
aVIt was called Prototaxites.
p127
aVPrototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall.
p128
aVThe tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet.
p129
aVDr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago,
p130
aVpublished an article in the Journal of Geology
p131
aVthis past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus,
p132
aVa giant mushroom.
p133
aVAcross the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.
p134
aVAll across most land masses.
p135
aVAnd these existed for tens of millions of years.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, we've had several extinction events, and as we march forward \u2014
p138
aV65 million years ago \u2014 most of you know about it \u2014
p139
aVwe had an asteroid impact.
p140
aVThe Earth was struck by an asteroid,
p141
aVa huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.
p142
aVSunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth.
p143
aVThose organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded,
p144
aVbecause fungi do not need light.
p145
aVMore recently, at Einstein University,
p146
aVthey just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy,
p147
aVmuch like plants use light.
p148
aVSo, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere,
p149
aVI think, is a forgone conclusion,
p150
aVat least in my own mind.
p151
aa(lp152
VThe largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon.
p153
aVI couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size:
p154
aV2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.
p155
aVThe largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.
p156
aVHow is it that this organism can be so large,
p157
aVand yet be one cell wall thick,
p158
aVwhereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?
p159
aVThe mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom \u2014
p160
aVit bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.
p161
aVWe were involved with several experiments.
p162
aVI'm going to show you six, if I can,
p163
aVsolutions for helping to save the world.
p164
aVBattelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington.
p165
aVThere were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste:
p166
aVone was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes;
p167
aVone pile was treated with bacteria;
p168
aVand our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium.
p169
aVThe mycelium absorbs the oil.
p170
aVThe mycelium is producing enzymes \u2014
p171
aVperoxidases \u2014 that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.
p172
aVThese are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.
p173
aVSo, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil,
p174
aVand then, when we returned six weeks later,
p175
aVall the tarps were removed,
p176
aVall the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.
p177
aVWe came back to our pile, it was covered
p178
aVwith hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms,
p179
aVand the color changed to a light form.
p180
aVThe enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons
p181
aVinto carbohydrates \u2014 fungal sugars.
p182
aa(lp183
VSome of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.
p184
aVThey're very large.
p185
aVThey're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained.
p186
aVBut something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.
p187
aVThey sporulated, the spores attract insects,
p188
aVthe insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae.
p189
aVBirds then came, bringing in seeds,
p190
aVand our pile became an oasis of life.
p191
aVWhereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky,
p192
aVand the PAH's \u2014 the aromatic hydrocarbons \u2014
p193
aVwent from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks.
p194
aVThe last image we don't have.
p195
aVThe entire pile was a green berm of life.
p196
aVThese are gateway species,
p197
aVvanguard species that open the door for other biological communities.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo I invented burlap sacks, bunker spawn \u2014
p200
aVand putting the mycelium \u2014 using storm blown debris,
p201
aVyou can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream
p202
aVfrom a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes,
p203
aVor a factory with chemical toxins,
p204
aVand it leads to habitat restoration.
p205
aVSo, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington,
p206
aVand we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms.
p207
aVAnd I'll show you a graph here.
p208
aVThis is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power.
p209
aVThere's more than a 100 million colonies per gram,
p210
aVand 10 to the third power is around 1,000.
p211
aVIn 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species
p212
aVreduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times.
p213
aVThink of the implications.
p214
aVThis is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris \u2014
p215
aVand we can guarantee that we will have storms every year.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo, this one mushroom, in particular, has drawn our interest over time.
p218
aVThis is my wife Dusty,
p219
aVwith a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis \u2014 Agarikon.
p220
aVIt's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest
p221
aVthat Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.
p222
aVas a treatment against consumption.
p223
aVThis mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon,
p224
aVnorthern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe.
p225
aVMay not seem that large \u2014
p226
aVlet's get closer.
p227
aVThis is extremely rare fungus.
p228
aVOur team \u2014 and we have a team of experts that go out \u2014
p229
aVwe went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year.
p230
aVWe found one sample to be able to get into culture.
p231
aa(lp232
VPreserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest
p233
aVI think is absolutely critical for human health.
p234
aVI've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.
p235
aVWe submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water,
p236
aVand mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites.
p237
aVAnd a few years ago,
p238
aVwe received these results.
p239
aVWe have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms
p240
aVthat were highly active against poxviruses.
p241
aVDr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert
p242
aVof the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds
p243
aVthat have a selectivity index of two or more are active.
p244
aV10 or greater are considered to be very active.
p245
aVOur mushroom strains were in the highly active range.
p246
aVThere's a vetted press release that you can read \u2014
p247
aVit's vetted by DOD \u2014
p248
aVif you Google "Stamets" and "smallpox."
p249
aVOr you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo, encouraged by this, naturally we went to flu viruses.
p252
aVAnd so, for the first time, I am showing this.
p253
aVWe have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms
p254
aVhighly active against flu viruses.
p255
aVHere's the selectivity index numbers \u2014
p256
aVagainst pox, you saw 10s and 20s \u2014 now against flu viruses,
p257
aVcompared to the ribavirin controls,
p258
aVwe have an extraordinarily high activity.
p259
aVAnd we're using a natural extract
p260
aVwithin the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.
p261
aVWe tried it against flu A viruses \u2014 H1N1, H3N2 \u2014
p262
aVas well as flu B viruses.
p263
aVSo then we tried a blend,
p264
aVand in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1,
p265
aVand we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index.
p266
aV(Applause)
p267
aVI then think that we can make the argument
p268
aVthat we should save the old-growth forest
p269
aVas a matter of national defense.
p270
aV(Applause)
p271
aa(lp272
VI became interested in entomopathogenic fungi \u2014
p273
aVfungi that kill insects.
p274
aVOur house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.
p275
aVSo, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies
p276
aVwith metarhizium species of a group of fungi
p277
aVthat kill carpenter ants, as well as termites.
p278
aVI did something that nobody else had done.
p279
aVI actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores.
p280
aVThese are spores \u2014 this is in their spores.
p281
aVI was able to morph the culture
p282
aVinto a non-sporulating form.
p283
aVAnd so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars
p284
aVspecifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.
p285
aVBut the insects aren't stupid,
p286
aVand they would avoid the spores when they came close,
p287
aVand so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.
p288
aVAnd I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish,
p289
aVI put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants
p290
aVwere making debris fields, every day,
p291
aVin my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium,
p292
aVbecause there's no spores.
p293
aVThey gave it to the queen.
p294
aVOne week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd then \u2014 a delicate dance between dinner and death \u2014
p297
aVthe mycelium is consumed by the ants,
p298
aVthey become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head.
p299
aV(Laughter)
p300
aVNow after sporulation, the spores repel.
p301
aVSo, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.
p302
aVSo, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.
p303
aVAnd so my house came down, I received my first patent
p304
aVagainst carpenter ants, termites and fire ants.
p305
aVThen we tried extracts, and lo and behold,
p306
aVwe can steer insects to different directions.
p307
aVThis has huge implications.
p308
aVI then received my second patent \u2014 and this is a big one.
p309
aVIt's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.
p310
aVIt covers over 200,000 species.
p311
aVThis is the most disruptive technology \u2014
p312
aVI've been told by executives of the pesticide industry \u2014
p313
aVthat they have ever witnessed.
p314
aVThis could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.
p315
aVYou could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept,
p316
aVbecause my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi,
p317
aVprior to sporulation, attract the very insects
p318
aVthat are otherwise repelled by those spores.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system.
p321
aVThe Life Box \u2014 you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference \u2014
p322
aVyou add soil, you add water,
p323
aVyou have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores,
p324
aVlike of the Agarikon mushroom.
p325
aVThe seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.
p326
aVAnd then you put tree seeds in here,
p327
aVand then you end up growing \u2014 potentially \u2014
p328
aVan old-growth forest from a cardboard box.
p329
aa(lp330
VI want to reinvent the delivery system,
p331
aVand the use of cardboard around the world,
p332
aVso they become ecological footprints.
p333
aVIf there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up,
p334
aVyou could make it interactive, zip code specific \u2014
p335
aVwhere people could join together,
p336
aVand through satellite imaging systems,
p337
aVthrough Virtual Earth or Google Earth,
p338
aVyou could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered
p339
aVby the trees that are coming through Life Boxes.
p340
aa(lp341
VYou could take a cardboard box delivering shoes,
p342
aVyou could add water \u2014 I developed this for the refugee community \u2014
p343
aVcorns, beans and squash and onions.
p344
aVI took several containers \u2014 my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could \u2014
p345
aVand I ended up growing a seed garden.
p346
aVThen you harvest the seeds \u2014
p347
aVand thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this \u2014
p348
aVand then you're harvesting the seed garden.
p349
aVThen you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels.
p350
aVI add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs.
p351
aVNow, three corncobs, no other grain \u2014
p352
aVlots of mushrooms begin to form.
p353
aVToo many withdrawals from the carbon bank,
p354
aVand so this population will be shut down.
p355
aVBut watch what happens here.
p356
aVThe mushrooms then are harvested,
p357
aVbut very importantly,
p358
aVthe mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars.
p359
aVAnd so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country?
p360
aVAnd we came up with Econol.
p361
aa(lp362
VGenerating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary \u2014
p363
aVand you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already.
p364
aVBut to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent,
p365
aVand I think that we need to be econologically intelligent
p366
aVabout the generation of fuels.
p367
aVSo, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils.
p368
aVThese are a species that we need to join with.
p369
aVI think engaging mycelium can help save the world.
p370
aVThank you very much.

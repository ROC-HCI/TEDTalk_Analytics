VSo, I'm in Chile,
p5
aVin the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby,
p6
aVbecause that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection,
p7
aVand I have this picture up on my screen,
p8
aVand a woman comes up behind me.
p9
aVShe says, "Oh, that's beautiful.
p10
aVWhat is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"
p11
aVAnd unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.
p12
aVI said, "No, it's \u2014 it's penguin shit."
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd, you know, "Excuse me!"
p17
aVAnd I could sense
p18
aVthat she thought I was speaking synecdochically.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, I said, "No, no, really \u2014 it's penguin shit."
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VBecause I had just been in the Falkland Islands
p27
aVtaking pictures of penguins.
p28
aVThis is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical.
p29
aVSo, literally, a few minutes before that,
p30
aVI downloaded this scientific paper
p31
aVabout calculations on avian defecation,
p32
aVwhich is really quite interesting, because it turns out
p33
aVyou can model this as something called "Poiseuille flow,"
p34
aVand you can learn an awful lot
p35
aVabout the physics of the avian rectum.
p36
aVActually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca.
p37
aa(lp38
VAt this point, she stops me,
p39
aVand she says, "Who are you?
p40
aVWha \u2014 what do you do?"
p41
aVAnd I was stuck,
p42
aVbecause I didn't have any way to describe what I do.
p43
aVAnd so, in some sense,
p44
aVthis talk today
p45
aVis my answer to that.
p46
aVIt's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.
p47
aVAnd it's very hard for me to make sense of it,
p48
aVso I'm not sure that you can.
p49
aVIt's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes \u2014
p50
aVoften at four in the morning.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo, some people are afraid of what I do.
p53
aVSome people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano,
p54
aVand in response, I have ordered
p55
aVa bulletproof pocket protector.
p56
aVI'm not sure what these people think,
p57
aVbecause I don't speak Norsk.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VBut I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.
p62
aVI don't know, you know?
p63
aVSo, one of the things that I love to do
p64
aVis travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.
p65
aVBecause archaeology gives us an opportunity
p66
aVto study past civilizations,
p67
aVand see where they succeeded
p68
aVand where they failed.
p69
aVUse science to, you know,
p70
aVwork backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?"
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd recently, I was in Easter Island,
p73
aVwhich is an incredibly beautiful place,
p74
aVand an incredibly mysterious place,
p75
aVbecause no matter where you go in Easter Island,
p76
aVyou're struck by these statues, called the moai.
p77
aVThe place is 64 square miles.
p78
aVThey made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.
p79
aVWhy on Earth? And if you haven't read
p80
aVJared Diamond's book, "Collapse,"
p81
aVI totally recommend that you do.
p82
aVHe's got a great chapter about it.
p83
aVBasically, these people
p84
aVcommitted ecological suicide
p85
aVin order to make more of these.
p86
aVAnd somewhere along the line, somebody said,
p87
aV"I know! Let's cut down the last tree
p88
aVand commit suicide, because
p89
aVwe need more identical statues."
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd,
p94
aVone thing that isn't a mystery, actually,
p95
aVwas when I grew up \u2014 because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures \u2014
p96
aVand I thought, "Well, why that look on the face?
p97
aVWhy that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.
p98
aVWhere did they get that inspiration?
p99
aVAnd then I met Yoyo,
p100
aVwho is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,
p101
aVand if you look at Yoyo's face,
p102
aVyou kind of figure out where they got it.
p103
aa(lp104
VThere's many mysteries, these statues.
p105
aVEveryone wants to know, how did they make them,
p106
aVhow did they transport them?
p107
aVThis woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.
p108
aVShe's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.
p109
aVAnd she has studied the statues for 20-some years,
p110
aVand she has detailed records of every single statue.
p111
aVThe one on the page here is the same that's up there.
p112
aVOne interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard.
p113
aVSo, this used to be completely smooth.
p114
aVIn fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,
p115
aVthe backs are totally smooth \u2014 almost glass smooth.
p116
aVBut after 1,000 years out in the weather,
p117
aVthey look like this.
p118
aa(lp119
VJo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,
p120
aVand we're going to do a very high-res digitization,
p121
aVfirst because it's a way of preserving them.
p122
aVSecond, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,
p123
aVlearn a few of the mysteries about them.
p124
aVHow long have they been standing in what positions?
p125
aVAnd maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of
p126
aVwhat caused them to be the way they are.
p127
aVWhile I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,
p128
aVso you get a gratuitous picture
p129
aVof a moai with a comet.
p130
aa(lp131
VI also have an archaeological project going on
p132
aVin Egypt.
p133
aV"Going on" is perhaps a little bit strong.
p134
aVWe're trying to get all of the permissions
p135
aVto get everything all set, to get it going.
p136
aVSo, I'll talk about it at a future TED.
p137
aVBut there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.
p138
aVAnother thing I do is I invent stuff.
p139
aVIn fact, I design nuclear reactors.
p140
aVNot a joke.
p141
aVThis is the conventional
p142
aVnuclear fuel cycle.
p143
aVThe red line is what is done in
p144
aVmost nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.
p145
aVThe white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle,
p146
aVwhere you reprocess.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, this is the normal way it's done.
p149
aVIt's got the huge advantage that it
p150
aVdoes not create carbon pollution.
p151
aVIt has a lot of disadvantages:
p152
aVeach one of these steps is extremely expensive,
p153
aVit's potentially dangerous
p154
aVand they have the interesting property that the step
p155
aVcannot be performed in anyone's backyard,
p156
aVwhich is a problem.
p157
aVSo, our reactor eliminates these steps,
p158
aVwhich, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.
p159
aVNow, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.
p160
aVThere's \u2014 no reactor's been even built
p161
aVto an old design, much less a new one, in the United States
p162
aVfor 25 years.
p163
aVIt's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return
p164
aVthing that we do.
p165
aa(lp166
VChanging into a totally different field,
p167
aVwe do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,
p168
aVparticularly in an area called metamaterials.
p169
aVA metamaterial is an artificial material,
p170
aVwhich manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,
p171
aVin a way that you couldn't otherwise.
p172
aVSo, this device here is an invisibility cloak.
p173
aVIt may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,
p174
aVthis is how you would view it.
p175
aVRays of light \u2014 in this case, microwave light \u2014
p176
aVcome in, and they just squish around the cell,
p177
aVand they come back the other side.
p178
aVNow, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.
p179
aVThe cool thing is, this does it from all angles.
p180
aVMetamaterials, unfortunately \u2014
p181
aVA, it only works on microwave,
p182
aVand B, it doesn't work all that well yet.
p183
aVBut metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.
p184
aVIt's \u2014 you know, today I'd like to say
p185
aVit's a zero billion dollar business, but,
p186
aVin fact, it's negative.
p187
aVBut some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.
p188
aa(lp189
VWe do a lot of work in biomedical fields.
p190
aVIn this case, we're working with a major medical foundation
p191
aVto develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing
p192
aVdiseases in developing countries.
p193
aVSo, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul \u2014
p194
aVturns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff.
p195
aVAnd these happen to be my eyes, by the way.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, I'm also very interested in cooking.
p198
aVWhile I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absence
p199
aVand went to a chef school in France.
p200
aVI used to work, also while at Microsoft,
p201
aVat a leading restaurant in Seattle,
p202
aVso I do a lot of cooking.
p203
aVI've been on a team that won
p204
aVthe world championship of barbecue.
p205
aVBut barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods
p206
aVlike chili, or bouillabaisse.
p207
aVVarious parts of the world will have a cult food
p208
aVthat people get enormously attached to \u2014
p209
aVthere's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy.
p210
aVAnd I'm trying to use a very
p211
aVscientific approach.
p212
aVSo, this is my latest cooker,
p213
aVand if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,
p214
aVthat's because it is.
p215
aVBut if you get to play with all those knobs and dials \u2014
p216
aVand of course, really the controller over there does it all on software \u2014
p217
aVyou can make some terrific ribs.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VThis is a high-speed centrifuge.
p222
aVYou should all have one in your kitchen,
p223
aVbeside your Turbochef.
p224
aVThis subjects food to a force about 50,000 times
p225
aVthat of normal gravity,
p226
aVand oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.
p227
aVYou would not believe it!
p228
aVI perform a series of ghoulish experiments
p229
aVon food \u2014
p230
aVin this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model
p231
aVso that one can predict exactly
p232
aVwhat the internal cooking times are.
p233
aVIt turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun.
p234
aVTheory is red,
p235
aVblack is experiment.
p236
aVSo, I'm either really good at faking it,
p237
aVor this particular model seems to work.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo, another random thing I do
p240
aVis the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,
p241
aVor SETI.
p242
aVAnd you may be familiar with the movie "Contact,"
p243
aVwhich sort of popularized that.
p244
aVIt turns out there are real people who go out
p245
aVand search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.
p246
aVIn fact, almost everybody in the movie
p247
aVis based on a real character, a real person.
p248
aVSo, the Jodie Foster character here
p249
aVis actually this woman, Jill Tarter,
p250
aVand Jill has dedicated her life to this.
p251
aVYou know, a lot of people risk their lives
p252
aVin a brief act of heroism,
p253
aVwhich is kind of cool,
p254
aVbut Jill has
p255
aVwhat I call slow heroism.
p256
aVShe is risking her professional life on something
p257
aVthat her own calculations show
p258
aVmay not work for a thousand years \u2014 may not ever.
p259
aVSo, I like to support people that are risking their lives.
p260
aa(lp261
VAfter the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI.
p262
aVMy kids saw the movie,
p263
aVand afterwards they came to me and they said,
p264
aV"So, Dad, so \u2014 so \u2014
p265
aVthat character \u2014 that's Jill, right?"
p266
aVI said, "Oh, yeah, yeah \u2014 absolutely."
p267
aV"And that other person, that's someone \u2014 " I said, "Yes."
p268
aVThey said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?
p269
aVIs that you?"
p270
aVI said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on."
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VSo, the SETI Institute,
p275
aVwith a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen
p276
aVand a variety of other people,
p277
aVis building a dedicated radio telescope
p278
aVin Hat Creek, California,
p279
aVso they can do this SETI work.
p280
aVNow, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot,
p281
aVand the one person who always gets updated
p282
aVon all my cell phones and pagers and everything else
p283
aVis Jill, because I really don't want to miss
p284
aV"the call."
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
VI mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home,
p289
aVand I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible!
p290
aVSo, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.
p291
aVI'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.
p292
aVAnd I resemble that remark.
p293
aVI'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs,
p294
aVwhich is the finding of them.
p295
aVNow, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions
p296
aVlooking for a dinosaur.
p297
aVIt sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.
p298
aVIt's horrible conditions, because
p299
aVwherever you have nice weather,
p300
aVplants grow,
p301
aVand you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.
p302
aVSo, you always find dinosaurs
p303
aVin deserts or badlands,
p304
aVareas that have very little plant growth
p305
aVand have flash floods in the spring.
p306
aVYou know, skiers pray for snow?
p307
aVPaleontologists pray for erosion.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo, you hike around
p310
aVand \u2014 this is after you dig them up, they look like this.
p311
aVYou hike around, you see something like this.
p312
aVNow, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.
p313
aVYou've got this bentonite clay,
p314
aVwhich is \u2014 sort of swells up and expands.
p315
aVAnd there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,
p316
aVand you look up close, and you say,
p317
aV"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?"
p318
aVWell, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,
p319
aVfrom the shape, that these are skull fragments.
p320
aVAnd then when you look at this,
p321
aVyou say, "That's a tooth.
p322
aVIt's a big tooth."
p323
aVIt's about the size of a banana.
p324
aVIt has a big serration on the edge.
p325
aVThis is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.
p326
aVAnd this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex,
p327
aVwhich I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.
p328
aa(lp329
VNow, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room.
p330
aVNot the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought,
p331
aVand then, after buying the cast, I found my own,
p332
aVand I don't have room for two.
p333
aVYou know.
p334
aVSo, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs
p335
aVis that it is both an intellectual thing,
p336
aVbecause you're trying to reconstruct the environment
p337
aVof millions of years ago.
p338
aVIt's something that can inform all sorts of science
p339
aVin unexpected ways.
p340
aVThe study of dinosaurs led to the realization
p341
aVthat there's a problem with asteroid impact,
p342
aVfor example.
p343
aVThe study of dinosaurs may, literally,
p344
aVone day save the planet.
p345
aa(lp346
VStudy of the ancient climate is very important.
p347
aVIn fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,
p348
aVhad much higher CO2 than today,
p349
aVwas much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points
p350
aVfor the effects of CO2 on climate.
p351
aVBut, besides being intellectually
p352
aVand scientifically interesting, it's also very different
p353
aVthan the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.
p354
aVThis is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.
p355
aVThis is one of my papers: "A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod."
p356
aVIt's not as gripping as dinosaur sex,
p357
aVso we're not going to go into it further.
p358
aa(lp359
VNow, I'm also really big on photography.
p360
aVI travel all over the world taking pictures \u2014
p361
aVsome of them good, most of them not.
p362
aVThese days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means
p363
aVyou've got to spend more time sorting through them.
p364
aVHere's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands
p365
aVof king penguins on a beach.
p366
aVHere's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.
p367
aVI'd gone up to photograph Orcas,
p368
aVand we had looked for a week,
p369
aVand we hadn't seen a damn Orca.
p370
aVAnd the last day, the sun comes out,
p371
aVthe Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic.
p372
aVAnd I get lots of pictures like this.
p373
aVThen, a little bit later,
p374
aVI start getting some pictures like this.
p375
aVNow, to a human audience, I need to explain that
p376
aVif Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition,
p377
aVthis would be the centerfold.
p378
aVIt's true.
p379
aVSo, there's more and more activity near the boat,
p380
aVand all of a sudden somebody shouts,
p381
aV"What's that in the water?"
p382
aVI said, "Well, I think that's what you call a free willy."
p383
aa(lp384
V(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
VThere's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Laughter)
p389
aVThe first thing you learn
p390
aVis the overwhelming importance of hands.
p391
aVThey don't have them.
p392
aa(lp393
V(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VI think Paul Simon is in the audience,
p396
aVand he has \u2014
p397
aVhe may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex,
p398
aV"Slip-Slidin' Away."
p399
aVThat's kind of what it's like.
p400
aVThe other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex:
p401
aVthey curl their toes too.
p402
aa(lp403
V(Laughter)
p404
aa(lp405
VSo \u2014
p406
aVwhere do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together?
p407
aVYou know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom
p408
aVin finding a great thing, passion in life,
p409
aVand focusing all your energy on it,
p410
aVand I've never been able to do that.
p411
aVI just \u2014 you know, because, yes,
p412
aVI'll focus passion on something,
p413
aVbut then there will be something else, and then there's something else again.
p414
aVAnd for a long time I fought this, and I thought,
p415
aV"Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down."
p416
aVAnd you know, when I was at Microsoft,
p417
aVthat was so engrossing,
p418
aVand the whole industry was expanding so much,
p419
aVthat it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life.
p420
aa(lp421
VBut ultimately,
p422
aVI decided
p423
aVthat what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am,
p424
aVbut embrace it.
p425
aVAnd say, "Yeah, you know, I \u2014
p426
aVthis whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep,
p427
aVbut that's really what works for me."
p428
aVAnd regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors
p429
aVor metamaterials or whale sex,
p430
aVthe common \u2014 or lowest common denominator \u2014 is me.
p431
aVThat's it, thank you.

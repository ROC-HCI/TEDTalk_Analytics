VWe all go to doctors.
p5
aVAnd we do so with trust and blind faith
p6
aVthat the test they are ordering and the medications they're prescribing
p7
aVare based upon evidence \u2014
p8
aVevidence that's designed to help us.
p9
aVHowever, the reality is that that hasn't always been the case for everyone.
p10
aVWhat if I told you
p11
aVthat the medical science discovered over the past century
p12
aVhas been based on only half the population?
p13
aa(lp14
VI'm an emergency medicine doctor.
p15
aVI was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency.
p16
aVIt's about saving lives. How cool is that?
p17
aVOK, there's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes,
p18
aVbut no matter who walks through the door to the ER,
p19
aVwe order the same tests,
p20
aVwe prescribe the same medication,
p21
aVwithout ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients.
p22
aVWhy would we?
p23
aVWe were never taught that there were any differences between men and women.
p24
aa(lp25
VA recent Government Accountability study revealed that 80 percent of the drugs
p26
aVwithdrawn from the market
p27
aVare due to side effects on women.
p28
aVSo let's think about that for a minute.
p29
aVWhy are we discovering side effects on women
p30
aVonly after a drug has been released to the market?
p31
aVDo you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea
p32
aVto being tested on cells in a laboratory,
p33
aVto animal studies,
p34
aVto then clinical trials on humans,
p35
aVfinally to go through a regulatory approval process,
p36
aVto be available for your doctor to prescribe to you?
p37
aVNot to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding
p38
aVit takes to go through that process.
p39
aVSo why are we discovering unacceptable side effects
p40
aVon half the population after that has gone through?
p41
aVWhat's happening?
p42
aa(lp43
VWell, it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory,
p44
aVthey're male cells,
p45
aVand the animals used in the animal studies were male animals,
p46
aVand the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men.
p47
aa(lp48
VHow is it that the male model became our framework for medical research?
p49
aVLet's look at an example that has been popularized in the media,
p50
aVand it has to do with the sleep aid Ambien.
p51
aVAmbien was released on the market over 20 years ago,
p52
aVand since then, hundreds of millions of prescriptions have been written,
p53
aVprimarily to women, because women suffer more sleep disorders than men.
p54
aVBut just this past year,
p55
aVthe Food and Drug Administration recommended cutting the dose in half
p56
aVfor women only,
p57
aVbecause they just realized that women metabolize the drug
p58
aVat a slower rate than men,
p59
aVcausing them to wake up in the morning
p60
aVwith more of the active drug in their system.
p61
aVAnd then they're drowsy and they're getting behind the wheel of the car,
p62
aVand they're at risk for motor vehicle accidents.
p63
aVAnd I can't help but think, as an emergency physician,
p64
aVhow many of my patients that I've cared for over the years
p65
aVwere involved in a motor vehicle accident
p66
aVthat possibly could have been prevented
p67
aVif this type of analysis was performed and acted upon 20 years ago
p68
aVwhen this drug was first released.
p69
aVHow many other things need to be analyzed by gender?
p70
aVWhat else are we missing?
p71
aa(lp72
VWorld War II changed a lot of things,
p73
aVand one of them was this need to protect people
p74
aVfrom becoming victims of medical research without informed consent.
p75
aVSo some much-needed guidelines or rules were set into place,
p76
aVand part of that was this desire to protect women of childbearing age
p77
aVfrom entering into any medical research studies.
p78
aVThere was fear: what if something happened to the fetus during the study?
p79
aVWho would be responsible?
p80
aVAnd so the scientists at this time actually thought
p81
aVthis was a blessing in disguise,
p82
aVbecause let's face it \u2014 men's bodies are pretty homogeneous.
p83
aVThey don't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones
p84
aVthat could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men.
p85
aVIt was easier. It was cheaper.
p86
aVNot to mention, at this time, there was a general assumption
p87
aVthat men and women were alike in every way,
p88
aVapart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones.
p89
aVSo it was decided:
p90
aVmedical research was performed on men,
p91
aVand the results were later applied to women.
p92
aa(lp93
VWhat did this do to the notion of women's health?
p94
aVWomen's health became synonymous with reproduction:
p95
aVbreasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.
p96
aVIt's this term we now refer to as "bikini medicine."
p97
aVAnd this stayed this way until about the 1980s,
p98
aVwhen this concept was challenged by the medical community
p99
aVand by the public health policymakers when they realized that
p100
aVby excluding women from all medical research studies
p101
aVwe actually did them a disservice,
p102
aVin that apart from reproductive issues,
p103
aVvirtually nothing was known about the unique needs
p104
aVof the female patient.
p105
aa(lp106
VSince that time, an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light
p107
aVthat shows us just how different men and women are in every way.
p108
aVYou know, we have this saying in medicine:
p109
aVchildren are not just little adults.
p110
aVAnd we say that to remind ourselves
p111
aVthat children actually have a different physiology than normal adults.
p112
aVAnd it's because of this that the medical specialty of pediatrics came to light.
p113
aVAnd we now conduct research on children in order to improve their lives.
p114
aVAnd I know the same thing can be said about women.
p115
aVWomen are not just men with boobs and tubes.
p116
aVBut they have their own anatomy and physiology
p117
aVthat deserves to be studied with the same intensity.
p118
aa(lp119
VLet's take the cardiovascular system, for example.
p120
aVThis area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out
p121
aVwhy it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks.
p122
aVHeart disease is the number one killer for both men and women,
p123
aVbut more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men.
p124
aVMen will complain of crushing chest pain \u2014
p125
aVan elephant is sitting on their chest.
p126
aVAnd we call this typical.
p127
aVWomen have chest pain, too.
p128
aVBut more women than men will complain of "just not feeling right,"
p129
aV"can't seem to get enough air in,"
p130
aV"just so tired lately."
p131
aVAnd for some reason we call this atypical,
p132
aVeven though, as I mentioned, women do make up half the population.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd so what is some of the evidence to help explain some of these differences?
p135
aVIf we look at the anatomy,
p136
aVthe blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women compared to men,
p137
aVand the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different
p138
aVin women compared to men.
p139
aVAnd the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack,
p140
aVwell, they were initially designed and tested and perfected in men,
p141
aVand so aren't as good at determining that in women.
p142
aVAnd then if we think about the medications \u2014
p143
aVcommon medications that we use, like aspirin.
p144
aVWe give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack,
p145
aVbut do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman,
p146
aVit's actually harmful?
p147
aa(lp148
VWhat this is doing is merely telling us
p149
aVthat we are scratching the surface.
p150
aVEmergency medicine is a fast-paced business.
p151
aVIn how many life-saving areas of medicine,
p152
aVlike cancer and stroke,
p153
aVare there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing?
p154
aVOr even, why is it that some people get those runny noses
p155
aVmore than others,
p156
aVor why the pain medication that we give to those stubbed toes
p157
aVwork in some and not in others?
p158
aa(lp159
VThe Institute of Medicine has said every cell has a sex.
p160
aVWhat does this mean?
p161
aVSex is DNA.
p162
aVGender is how someone presents themselves in society.
p163
aVAnd these two may not always match up,
p164
aVas we can see with our transgendered population.
p165
aVBut it's important to realize that from the moment of conception,
p166
aVevery cell in our bodies \u2014
p167
aVskin, hair, heart and lungs \u2014
p168
aVcontains our own unique DNA,
p169
aVand that DNA contains the chromosomes that determine
p170
aVwhether we become male or female, man or woman.
p171
aa(lp172
VIt used to be thought
p173
aVthat those sex-determining chromosomes pictured here \u2014
p174
aVXY if you're male, XX if you're female \u2014
p175
aVmerely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes,
p176
aVand it was the sex hormones that those organs produced
p177
aVthat were responsible for the differences we see in the opposite sex.
p178
aVBut we now know that that theory was wrong \u2014
p179
aVor it's at least a little incomplete.
p180
aVAnd thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page from the Whitehead Institute,
p181
aVwho works on the Y chromosome,
p182
aVand Doctor Yang from UCLA,
p183
aVthey have found evidence that tells us that those sex-determining chromosomes
p184
aVthat are in every cell in our bodies
p185
aVcontinue to remain active for our entire lives
p186
aVand could be what's responsible for the differences we see
p187
aVin the dosing of drugs,
p188
aVor why there are differences between men and women
p189
aVin the susceptibility and severity of diseases.
p190
aVThis new knowledge is the game-changer,
p191
aVand it's up to those scientists that continue to find that evidence,
p192
aVbut it's up to the clinicians to start translating this data
p193
aVat the bedside, today.
p194
aVRight now.
p195
aVAnd to help do this, I'm a co-founder of a national organization
p196
aVcalled Sex and Gender Women's Health Collaborative,
p197
aVand we collect all of this data so that it's available for teaching
p198
aVand for patient care.
p199
aVAnd we're working to bring together the medical educators to the table.
p200
aVThat's a big job.
p201
aVIt's changing the way medical training has been done since its inception.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut I believe in them.
p204
aVI know they're going to see the value of incorporating the gender lens
p205
aVinto the current curriculum.
p206
aVIt's about training the future health care providers correctly.
p207
aVAnd regionally,
p208
aVI'm a co-creator of a division within the Department of Emergency Medicine
p209
aVhere at Brown University,
p210
aVcalled Sex and Gender in Emergency Medicine,
p211
aVand we conduct the research to determine the differences between men and women
p212
aVin emergent conditions,
p213
aVlike heart disease and stroke and sepsis and substance abuse,
p214
aVbut we also believe that education is paramount.
p215
aa(lp216
VWe've created a 360-degree model of education.
p217
aVWe have programs for the doctors, for the nurses, for the students
p218
aVand for the patients.
p219
aVBecause this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders.
p220
aVWe all have a role in making a difference.
p221
aVBut I must warn you: this is not easy.
p222
aVIn fact, it's hard.
p223
aVIt's essentially changing the way we think about medicine
p224
aVand health and research.
p225
aVIt's changing our relationship to the health care system.
p226
aVBut there's no going back.
p227
aVWe now know just enough
p228
aVto know that we weren't doing it right.
p229
aa(lp230
VMartin Luther King, Jr. has said,
p231
aV"Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability,
p232
aVbut comes through continuous struggle."
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd the first step towards change is awareness.
p235
aVThis is not just about improving medical care for women.
p236
aVThis is about personalized, individualized health care for everyone.
p237
aVThis awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women.
p238
aVAnd from now on, I want you to ask your doctors
p239
aVwhether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender.
p240
aVThey may not know the answer \u2014
p241
aVyet.
p242
aVBut the conversation has begun, and together we can all learn.
p243
aVRemember, for me and my colleagues in this field,
p244
aVyour sex and gender matter.
p245
aa(lp246
VThank you.
p247

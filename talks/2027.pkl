VPuzzles
p5
aVand magic.
p6
aVI work in what most people think
p7
aVare two distinct fields,
p8
aVbut I believe they are the same.
p9
aVI am both a magician and
p10
aVa New York Times crossword puzzle constructor,
p11
aVwhich basically means I've taken
p12
aVthe world's two nerdiest hobbies
p13
aVand combined them into one career.
p14
aVAnd I believe that magic and puzzles are the same
p15
aVbecause they both key into one of
p16
aVthe most important human drives:
p17
aVthe urge to solve.
p18
aVHuman beings are wired to solve,
p19
aVto make order out of chaos.
p20
aa(lp21
VIt's certainly true for me.
p22
aVI've been solving my whole life.
p23
aVHigh school consisted of epic Scrabble matches in the cafeteria
p24
aVand not really talking to girls,
p25
aVand then at about that time
p26
aVI started learning magic tricks
p27
aVand definitely not talking to girls.
p28
aVThere's nothing like starting a conversation with,
p29
aV"Hey, did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth
p30
aV20 points in Scrabble?"
p31
aVBut back then, I noticed an intersection
p32
aVbetween puzzles and illusion.
p33
aVWhen you do the crossword puzzle
p34
aVor when you watch a magic show,
p35
aVyou become a solver,
p36
aVand your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos,
p37
aVthe chaos of, say, a black-and-white puzzle grid,
p38
aVa mixed-up bag of Scrabble tiles,
p39
aVor a shuffled pack of playing cards.
p40
aVAnd today, as a cruciverbalist \u2014
p41
aV23 points \u2014
p42
aVand an illusion designer, I create that chaos.
p43
aVI test your ability to solve.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, it turns out research tells us
p46
aVthat solving is as primal as eating and sleeping.
p47
aVFrom birth, we are wired to solve.
p48
aVIn one UCLA study, newborns still in the hospital
p49
aVwere shown patterns, patterns like this:
p50
aVcircle, cross, circle, cross.
p51
aVAnd then the pattern was changed: triangle, square.
p52
aVAnd by tracking an infant's gaze,
p53
aVwe know that newborns as young as a day old
p54
aVcan notice and respond to disruptions in order.
p55
aVIt's remarkable.
p56
aVSo from infancy through old age,
p57
aVthe urge to solve unites us all,
p58
aVand I even found this photo on Instagram
p59
aVof pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle
p60
aVwith her morning coffee.
p61
aa(lp62
VLike.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, solving exists across all cultures.
p66
aVThe American invention is the crossword puzzle,
p67
aVand this year we are celebrating
p68
aVthe 100th anniversary of the crossword puzzle,
p69
aVfirst published in The New York World.
p70
aVBut many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well.
p71
aVChina gives us tangrams,
p72
aVwhich would test solvers' abilities
p73
aVto form shapes from the jumbled pieces.
p74
aVChaos. Order.
p75
aVOrder.
p76
aVAnd order.
p77
aVThat one's my favorite, let's hear it again.
p78
aVOkay.
p79
aVAnd how about this puzzle
p80
aVinvented in 18th-century England:
p81
aVthe jigsaw puzzle.
p82
aVIs this not making order out of chaos?
p83
aa(lp84
VSo as you can see,
p85
aVwe are always solving.
p86
aVWe are always trying to decode our world.
p87
aVIt's an eternal quest.
p88
aVIt's just like the one Cervantes wrote about
p89
aVin "Don Quixote,"
p90
aVwhich by the way is the root of the word "quixotry,"
p91
aVthe highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time,
p92
aV365 points.
p93
aVBut anyway, "Don Quixote" is an important book.
p94
aVYou guys have read "Don Quixote," yes?
p95
aVI'm seeing some heads nod.
p96
aVCome on guys, really?
p97
aVWho's read "Don Quixote?" Let's do this. Raise your hands if you've read "Don Quixote."
p98
aVThere we go. Smart audience.
p99
aVWho's read "Don Quixote?" Get them up.
p100
aa(lp101
VOkay, good, because I need somebody smart here
p102
aVbecause now I'm going to demonstrate
p103
aVwith the help of one of you
p104
aVjust how deeply rooted your urge to solve is,
p105
aVjust how wired to solve all of you really are,
p106
aVso I'm going to come into the audience
p107
aVand find somebody to help me.
p108
aVLet's see.
p109
aVEverybody's looking away all of a sudden.
p110
aVCan I? Would you? What is your name? Gwen.
p111
aVI'm not a mind reader, I can see your name tag.
p112
aVCome with me, Gwen. Everyone give her  a round of applause, make her feel welcome.
p113
aVGwen, after you.
p114
aV(Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VAre you so excited?
p117
aVDid you know that your name is worth
p118
aVeight points in Scrabble?
p119
aVOkay, stand right here, Gwen, right here.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, Gwen, before we begin,
p122
aVI'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle,
p123
aVwhich is here in this envelope,
p124
aVand I will not go near it. Okay?
p125
aVAnd over here we have a drawing of some farm animals.
p126
aVYou can see we have an owl, we have a horse,
p127
aVa donkey, a rooster, an ox, and a sheep,
p128
aVand then here, Gwen, we have
p129
aVsome fancy art store markers,
p130
aVcolors like, can you see that word right there?
p131
aVGwen: Cobalt. David Kwong: Cobalt, yes. Cobalt.
p132
aVBut we have a silver, a red, an emerald,
p133
aVand an amber marker,
p134
aVand Gwen, you are going to color this drawing
p135
aVjust like you were five years old,
p136
aVone marker at a time.
p137
aVIt's going to be a lot of fun.
p138
aVBut I'm going to go over here.
p139
aVI don't want to see what you're doing.
p140
aVOkay, so don't start yet.
p141
aVWait for me to get over here and close my eyes.
p142
aVNow Gwen, are you ready?
p143
aa(lp144
VPick up just one marker, pick up just one marker,
p145
aVand why don't you color in the horse for me?
p146
aVColor in the horse \u2014 big, big, big scribbles,
p147
aVbroad strokes, don't worry about staying in the lines.
p148
aVAll right. Great.
p149
aVAnd why don't you take that marker and recap it
p150
aVand place it on the table for me.
p151
aVOkay, and pick up another marker out of the cup
p152
aVand take off the cap
p153
aVand color in the donkey for me, color in the donkey.
p154
aVBig scribbles.
p155
aVOkay, cool, and re-cap that marker
p156
aVand place it on the table.
p157
aVAnd pick up another marker for me
p158
aVand take off the cap. Isn't this fun?
p159
aVAnd color in the owl for me.
p160
aVColor in the owl.
p161
aVOkay, and recap that marker
p162
aVand pick up another marker out of the cup
p163
aVand color in the rooster for me, color in the rooster.
p164
aVGood, good, good, good, good.
p165
aVBig, big, big strokes. Good, good.
p166
aVPick up another marker out of the cup
p167
aVand color in the ox for me. Color in the ox.
p168
aVOkay, good.
p169
aVA lot of color on that, and recap, and place it on the table,
p170
aVand pick up another marker out of the cup.
p171
aVOh, I'm out? Okay, I'm going to turn around.
p172
aVDid I forget? Oh, I forgot my purple marker.
p173
aVThis is still going to work, though.
p174
aVI think this is still going to work, mostly.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo Gwen, I'm going to hand you this envelope.
p177
aVDon't open it yet. Do not open it yet,
p178
aVbut I am going to write down your choices
p179
aVso that everybody can see
p180
aVthe choices that you made.
p181
aVOkay, great. So we have a cobalt horse,
p182
aVamber owl,
p183
aVa silver ox,
p184
aVyes, okay, a red donkey,
p185
aVand what was the emerald color? A rooster.
p186
aVAn emerald rooster. Okay.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow for the moment of truth, Gwen,
p189
aVwe're going to take a look in that envelope.
p190
aVWhy don't you open it up and remove
p191
aVthe one piece of paper from inside
p192
aVand hand it to me,
p193
aVand we will see if it matches your choices.
p194
aVYes, I think it does.
p195
aVWe have a cobalt horse, we have a red donkey,
p196
aVwe have an amber owl, we have an emerald rooster, a silver ox,
p197
aVI forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep,
p198
aVbut that's a pretty amazing coincidence, don't you think?
p199
aVGwen, well done. That's beautiful. (Applause)
p200
aVI'll take that back from you.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo ladies and gentlemen, how is this possible?
p203
aVHow is this possible? Well, could it be
p204
aVthat Gwen's brain is so wired to solve
p205
aVthat she decoded hidden messages?
p206
aVWell this is the puzzle I present to you.
p207
aVCould there be order
p208
aVin the chaos that I created?
p209
aVLet's take a closer look.
p210
aVDo you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces?
p211
aVWhat image did it ultimately become? A cobalt horse.
p212
aVThe plot thickens.
p213
aVAnd then we played a game of tangrams
p214
aVwith an emerald rooster.
p215
aVThat one's my favorite.
p216
aVAnd then we had an experiment with a silver ox.
p217
aVAnd Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee
p218
aVout of an amber owl.
p219
aVThank you, Katy, for taking that photo for me.
p220
aVOh, and there's one more, there's one more.
p221
aVI believe you colored a red donkey, Gwen.
p222
aVLadies and gentlemen, could you raise your hands
p223
aVfor me if you've read "Don Quixote?"
p224
aVWho's read "Don Quixote?" (Laughter)
p225
aVBut wait, but wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more.
p226
aVThere's more.
p227
aVGwen, I was so confident
p228
aVthat you were going to make these choices
p229
aVthat I made another prediction,
p230
aVand I put it in an even more indelible place,
p231
aVand it's right here.
p232
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p233
aVwe have today's New York Times.
p234
aVThe date is March 18th, 2014.
p235
aVMany of you in the first couple of rows
p236
aVhave it underneath your seats as well.
p237
aVReally dig. We hid them under there.
p238
aVSee if you can fish out the newspaper
p239
aVand open up to the arts section
p240
aVand you will find the crossword puzzle,
p241
aVand the crossword puzzle today
p242
aVwas written by yours truly.
p243
aVYou can see my name above the grid.
p244
aVI'm going to give this to you, Gwen, to take a look.
p245
aVAnd I will also put it up on the screen.
p246
aVNow let's take a look
p247
aVat another piece of the puzzle.
p248
aVIf you look at the first clue for 1-across,
p249
aVit starts with the letter C, for corrupt,
p250
aVand just below that we have an O, for outfielder,
p251
aVand if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down,
p252
aVyou get cobalt horse,
p253
aVamber owl, silver ox,
p254
aVred donkey, and emerald rooster.
p255
aV(Applause)
p256
aVThat's pretty cool, right?
p257
aVIt's The New York Times.
p258
aVBut wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.
p259
aVOh, Gwen,
p260
aVdo you recall how I forgot my purple marker,
p261
aVand you were unable to color the sheep?
p262
aVWell, if you keep reading
p263
aVstarting with 25-down,
p264
aVit says,
p265
aV"Oh, by the way,
p266
aVthe sheep can be left blank."
p267
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p268
aVBut wait, wait, wait, there's one more thing,
p269
aVthere's one more thing,
p270
aVthere's one final piece of the puzzle.
p271
aVGwen, I am so grateful for your choices
p272
aVbecause if we take a look
p273
aVat the first letters of your combinations,
p274
aVwe get "C-H-A-O-S" for chaos
p275
aVand "O-R-D-E-R" for order.
p276
aVThat's chaos and order.
p277
aVWe've all made order out of chaos.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo ladies and gentlemen, the next time
p280
aVyou find yourself with a puzzle,
p281
aVwhether it's in your life or in your work,
p282
aVor maybe it's at the Sunday morning
p283
aVbreakfast table with The New York Times,
p284
aVremember, you are all wired to solve.
p285
aa(lp286
VThank you.
p287

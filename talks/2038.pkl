VI'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise.
p5
aVI soared through the galaxy
p6
aVdriving a huge starship
p7
aVwith a crew made up of people
p8
aVfrom all over this world,
p9
aVmany different races, many different cultures,
p10
aVmany different heritages,
p11
aVall working together,
p12
aVand our mission was to explore strange new worlds,
p13
aVto seek out new life and new civilizations,
p14
aVto boldly go where no one has gone before.
p15
aa(lp16
VWell \u2014
p17
aV(Applause) \u2014
p18
aVI am the grandson of immigrants from Japan
p19
aVwho went to America,
p20
aVboldly going to a strange new world,
p21
aVseeking new opportunities.
p22
aVMy mother was born in Sacramento, California.
p23
aVMy father was a San Franciscan.
p24
aVThey met and married in Los Angeles,
p25
aVand I was born there.
p26
aa(lp27
VI was four years old
p28
aVwhen Pearl Harbor was bombed
p29
aVon December 7, 1941 by Japan,
p30
aVand overnight, the world was plunged
p31
aVinto a world war.
p32
aVAmerica suddenly was swept up
p33
aVby hysteria.
p34
aVJapanese-Americans,
p35
aVAmerican citizens of Japanese ancestry,
p36
aVwere looked on
p37
aVwith suspicion and fear
p38
aVand with outright hatred
p39
aVsimply because we happened to look like
p40
aVthe people that bombed Pearl Harbor.
p41
aVAnd the hysteria grew and grew
p42
aVuntil in February 1942,
p43
aVthe president of the United States,
p44
aVFranklin Delano Roosevelt,
p45
aVordered all Japanese-Americans
p46
aVon the West Coast of America
p47
aVto be summarily rounded up
p48
aVwith no charges, with no trial,
p49
aVwith no due process.
p50
aVDue process, this is a core pillar
p51
aVof our justice system.
p52
aVThat all disappeared.
p53
aVWe were to be rounded up
p54
aVand imprisoned in 10 barbed-wire prison camps
p55
aVin some of the most desolate places in America:
p56
aVthe blistering hot desert of Arizona,
p57
aVthe sultry swamps of Arkansas,
p58
aVthe wastelands of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,
p59
aVand two of the most desolate places in California.
p60
aa(lp61
VOn April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday,
p62
aVand just a few weeks after my birthday,
p63
aVmy parents got my younger brother,
p64
aVmy baby sister and me
p65
aVup very early one morning,
p66
aVand they dressed us hurriedly.
p67
aVMy brother and I were in the living room
p68
aVlooking out the front window,
p69
aVand we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway.
p70
aVThey carried bayonets on their rifles.
p71
aVThey stomped up the front porch
p72
aVand banged on the door.
p73
aVMy father answered it,
p74
aVand the soldiers ordered us out of our home.
p75
aVMy father gave my brother and me
p76
aVsmall luggages to carry,
p77
aVand we walked out and stood on the driveway
p78
aVwaiting for our mother to come out,
p79
aVand when my mother finally came out,
p80
aVshe had our baby sister in one arm,
p81
aVa huge duffel bag in the other,
p82
aVand tears were streaming down both her cheeks.
p83
aVI will never be able to forget that scene.
p84
aVIt is burned into my memory.
p85
aa(lp86
VWe were taken from our home
p87
aVand loaded on to train cars
p88
aVwith other Japanese-American families.
p89
aVThere were guards stationed
p90
aVat both ends of each car,
p91
aVas if we were criminals.
p92
aVWe were taken two thirds of the way across the country,
p93
aVrocking on that train for four days and three nights,
p94
aVto the swamps of Arkansas.
p95
aVI still remember the barbed wire fence
p96
aVthat confined me.
p97
aVI remember the tall sentry tower
p98
aVwith the machine guns pointed at us.
p99
aVI remember the searchlight that followed me
p100
aVwhen I made the night runs
p101
aVfrom my barrack to the latrine.
p102
aVBut to five-year-old me,
p103
aVI thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way
p104
aVfor me to pee.
p105
aVI was a child,
p106
aVtoo young to understand the circumstances
p107
aVof my being there.
p108
aa(lp109
VChildren are amazingly adaptable.
p110
aVWhat would be grotesquely abnormal
p111
aVbecame my normality
p112
aVin the prisoner of war camps.
p113
aVIt became routine for me to line up three times a day
p114
aVto eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall.
p115
aVIt became normal for me to go with my father
p116
aVto bathe in a mass shower.
p117
aVBeing in a prison, a barbed-wire prison camp,
p118
aVbecame my normality.
p119
aa(lp120
VWhen the war ended,
p121
aVwe were released,
p122
aVand given a one-way ticket
p123
aVto anywhere in the United States.
p124
aVMy parents decided to go back home
p125
aVto Los Angeles,
p126
aVbut Los Angeles was not a welcoming place.
p127
aVWe were penniless.
p128
aVEverything had been taken from us,
p129
aVand the hostility was intense.
p130
aVOur first home was on Skid Row
p131
aVin the lowest part of our city,
p132
aVliving with derelicts, drunkards
p133
aVand crazy people,
p134
aVthe stench of urine all over,
p135
aVon the street, in the alley,
p136
aVin the hallway.
p137
aVIt was a horrible experience,
p138
aVand for us kids, it was terrorizing.
p139
aVI remember once
p140
aVa drunkard came staggering down,
p141
aVfell down right in front of us,
p142
aVand threw up.
p143
aVMy baby sister said, "Mama, let's go back home,"
p144
aVbecause behind barbed wires
p145
aVwas for us
p146
aVhome.
p147
aa(lp148
VMy parents worked hard
p149
aVto get back on their feet.
p150
aVWe had lost everything.
p151
aVThey were at the middle of their lives
p152
aVand starting all over.
p153
aVThey worked their fingers to the bone,
p154
aVand ultimately they were able
p155
aVto get the capital together to buy
p156
aVa three-bedroom home in a nice neighborhood.
p157
aVAnd I was a teenager,
p158
aVand I became very curious
p159
aVabout my childhood imprisonment.
p160
aVI had read civics books that told me about
p161
aVthe ideals of American democracy.
p162
aVAll men are created equal,
p163
aVwe have an inalienable right
p164
aVto life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
p165
aVand I couldn't quite make that fit
p166
aVwith what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment.
p167
aVI read history books,
p168
aVand I couldn't find anything about it.
p169
aVAnd so I engaged my father after dinner
p170
aVin long, sometimes heated conversations.
p171
aVWe had many, many conversations like that,
p172
aVand what I got from them
p173
aVwas my father's wisdom.
p174
aVHe was the one that suffered the most
p175
aVunder those conditions of imprisonment,
p176
aVand yet he understood American democracy.
p177
aVHe told me that our democracy
p178
aVis a people's democracy,
p179
aVand it can be as great as the people can be,
p180
aVbut it is also as fallible as people are.
p181
aVHe told me that American democracy
p182
aVis vitally dependent on good people
p183
aVwho cherish the ideals of our system
p184
aVand actively engage in the process
p185
aVof making our democracy work.
p186
aVAnd he took me to a campaign headquarters \u2014
p187
aVthe governor of Illinois was running for the presidency \u2014
p188
aVand introduced me to American electoral politics.
p189
aVAnd he also told me about
p190
aVyoung Japanese-Americans
p191
aVduring the Second World War.
p192
aa(lp193
VWhen Pearl Harbor was bombed,
p194
aVyoung Japanese-Americans, like all young Americans,
p195
aVrushed to their draft board
p196
aVto volunteer to fight for our country.
p197
aVThat act of patriotism
p198
aVwas answered with a slap in the face.
p199
aVWe were denied service,
p200
aVand categorized as enemy non-alien.
p201
aVIt was outrageous to be called an enemy
p202
aVwhen you're volunteering to fight for your country,
p203
aVbut that was compounded with the word "non-alien,"
p204
aVwhich is a word that means
p205
aV"citizen" in the negative.
p206
aVThey even took the word "citizen" away from us,
p207
aVand imprisoned them for a whole year.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd then the government realized
p210
aVthat there's a wartime manpower shortage,
p211
aVand as suddenly as they'd rounded us up,
p212
aVthey opened up the military for service
p213
aVby young Japanese-Americans.
p214
aVIt was totally irrational,
p215
aVbut the amazing thing,
p216
aVthe astounding thing,
p217
aVis that thousands of young
p218
aVJapanese-American men and women
p219
aVagain went from behind those barbed-wire fences,
p220
aVput on the same uniform as that of our guards,
p221
aVleaving their families in imprisonment,
p222
aVto fight for this country.
p223
aa(lp224
VThey said that they were going to fight
p225
aVnot only to get their families out
p226
aVfrom behind those barbed-wire fences,
p227
aVbut because they cherished the very ideal
p228
aVof what our government stands for,
p229
aVshould stand for,
p230
aVand that was being abrogated
p231
aVby what was being done.
p232
aa(lp233
VAll men are created equal.
p234
aVAnd they went to fight for this country.
p235
aVThey were put into a segregated
p236
aVall Japanese-American unit
p237
aVand sent to the battlefields of Europe,
p238
aVand they threw themselves into it.
p239
aVThey fought with amazing,
p240
aVincredible courage and valor.
p241
aVThey were sent out on the most dangerous missions
p242
aVand they sustained the highest combat casualty rate
p243
aVof any unit proportionally.
p244
aa(lp245
VThere is one battle that illustrates that.
p246
aVIt was a battle for the Gothic Line.
p247
aVThe Germans were embedded
p248
aVin this mountain hillside,
p249
aVrocky hillside,
p250
aVin impregnable caves,
p251
aVand three allied battalions
p252
aVhad been pounding away at it
p253
aVfor six months,
p254
aVand they were stalemated.
p255
aVThe 442nd was called in
p256
aVto add to the fight,
p257
aVbut the men of the 442nd
p258
aVcame up with a unique
p259
aVbut dangerous idea:
p260
aVThe backside of the mountain
p261
aVwas a sheer rock cliff.
p262
aVThe Germans thought an attack from the backside
p263
aVwould be impossible.
p264
aVThe men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible.
p265
aVOn a dark, moonless night,
p266
aVthey began scaling that rock wall,
p267
aVa drop of more than 1,000 feet,
p268
aVin full combat gear.
p269
aVThey climbed all night long
p270
aVon that sheer cliff.
p271
aVIn the darkness,
p272
aVsome lost their handhold
p273
aVor their footing
p274
aVand they fell to their deaths
p275
aVin the ravine below.
p276
aVThey all fell silently.
p277
aVNot a single one cried out,
p278
aVso as not to give their position away.
p279
aVThe men climbed for eight hours straight,
p280
aVand those who made it to the top
p281
aVstayed there until the first break of light,
p282
aVand as soon as light broke,
p283
aVthey attacked.
p284
aVThe Germans were surprised,
p285
aVand they took the hill
p286
aVand broke the Gothic Line.
p287
aVA six-month stalemate
p288
aVwas broken by the 442nd
p289
aVin 32 minutes.
p290
aa(lp291
VIt was an amazing act,
p292
aVand when the war ended,
p293
aVthe 442nd returned to the United States
p294
aVas the most decorated unit
p295
aVof the entire Second World War.
p296
aVThey were greeted back on the White House Lawn
p297
aVby President Truman, who said to them,
p298
aV"You fought not only the enemy
p299
aVbut prejudice, and you won."
p300
aa(lp301
VThey are my heroes.
p302
aVThey clung to their belief
p303
aVin the shining ideals of this country,
p304
aVand they proved that being an American
p305
aVis not just for some people,
p306
aVthat race is not how we define being an American.
p307
aVThey expanded what it means to be an American,
p308
aVincluding Japanese-Americans
p309
aVthat were feared and suspected and hated.
p310
aVThey were change agents,
p311
aVand they left for me
p312
aVa legacy.
p313
aVThey are my heroes
p314
aVand my father is my hero,
p315
aVwho understood democracy
p316
aVand guided me through it.
p317
aVThey gave me a legacy,
p318
aVand with that legacy comes a responsibility,
p319
aVand I am dedicated
p320
aVto making my country
p321
aVan even better America,
p322
aVto making our government
p323
aVan even truer democracy,
p324
aVand because of the heroes that I have
p325
aVand the struggles that we've gone through,
p326
aVI can stand before you
p327
aVas a gay Japanese-American,
p328
aVbut even more than that,
p329
aVI am a proud American.
p330
aa(lp331
VThank you very much.

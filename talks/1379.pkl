VA tourist is backpacking
p5
aVthrough the highlands of Scotland,
p6
aVand he stops at a pub to get a drink.
p7
aVAnd the only people in there is a bartender
p8
aVand an old man nursing a beer.
p9
aVAnd he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.
p10
aVAnd suddenly the old man turns to him and goes,
p11
aV"You see this bar?
p12
aVI built this bar with my bare hands
p13
aVfrom the finest wood in the county.
p14
aVGave it more love and care than my own child.
p15
aVBut do they call me MacGregor the bar builder? No."
p16
aVPoints out the window.
p17
aV"You see that stone wall out there?
p18
aVI built that stone wall with my bare hands.
p19
aVFound every stone, placed them just so through the rain and the cold.
p20
aVBut do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No."
p21
aVPoints out the window.
p22
aV"You see that pier on the lake out there?
p23
aVI built that pier with my bare hands.
p24
aVDrove the pilings against the tide of the sand, plank by plank.
p25
aVBut do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No.

VStorytelling \u2014
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVis joke telling.
p33
aVIt's knowing your punchline,
p34
aVyour ending,
p35
aVknowing that everything you're saying, from the first sentence to the last,
p36
aVis leading to a singular goal,
p37
aVand ideally confirming some truth
p38
aVthat deepens our understandings
p39
aVof who we are as human beings.
p40
aVWe all love stories.
p41
aVWe're born for them.
p42
aVStories affirm who we are.
p43
aVWe all want affirmations that our lives have meaning.
p44
aVAnd nothing does a greater affirmation
p45
aVthan when we connect through stories.
p46
aVIt can cross the barriers of time,
p47
aVpast, present and future,
p48
aVand allow us to experience
p49
aVthe similarities between ourselves
p50
aVand through others, real and imagined.
p51
aa(lp52
VThe children's television host Mr. Rogers
p53
aValways carried in his wallet
p54
aVa quote from a social worker
p55
aVthat said, "Frankly, there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love
p56
aVonce you've heard their story."
p57
aVAnd the way I like to interpret that
p58
aVis probably the greatest story commandment,
p59
aVwhich is "Make me care" \u2014
p60
aVplease, emotionally,
p61
aVintellectually, aesthetically,
p62
aVjust make me care.
p63
aVWe all know what it's like to not care.
p64
aVYou've gone through hundreds of TV channels,
p65
aVjust switching channel after channel,
p66
aVand then suddenly you actually stop on one.
p67
aVIt's already halfway over,
p68
aVbut something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.
p69
aVThat's not by chance,
p70
aVthat's by design.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo it got me thinking, what if I told you my history was story,
p73
aVhow I was born for it,
p74
aVhow I learned along the way this subject matter?
p75
aVAnd to make it more interesting,
p76
aVwe'll start from the ending
p77
aVand we'll go to the beginning.
p78
aVAnd so if I were going to give you the ending of this story,
p79
aVit would go something like this:
p80
aVAnd that's what ultimately led me
p81
aVto speaking to you here at TED
p82
aVabout story.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd the most current story lesson that I've had
p85
aVwas completing the film I've just done
p86
aVthis year in 2012.
p87
aVThe film is "John Carter." It's based on a book called "The Princess of Mars,"
p88
aVwhich was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.
p89
aVAnd Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself
p90
aVas a character inside this movie, and as the narrator.
p91
aVAnd he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion
p92
aVwith a telegram saying, "See me at once."
p93
aVBut once he gets there,
p94
aVhe's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away
p95
aVand been entombed in a mausoleum on the property.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Video) Butler: You won't find a keyhole.
p98
aVThing only opens from the inside.
p99
aVHe insisted,
p100
aVno embalming, no open coffin,
p101
aVno funeral.
p102
aVYou don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded
p103
aVby being like the rest of us, huh?
p104
aVCome, let's go inside.
p105
aa(lp106
VAS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book,
p107
aVis it's fundamentally making a promise.
p108
aVIt's making a promise to you
p109
aVthat this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.
p110
aVAnd that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise.
p111
aVYou could do it an infinite amount of ways.
p112
aVSometimes it's as simple as "Once upon a time ... "
p113
aVThese Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it.
p114
aVAnd I always thought it was such a fantastic device.
p115
aVIt's like a guy inviting you around the campfire,
p116
aVor somebody in a bar saying, "Here, let me tell you a story.
p117
aVIt didn't happen to me, it happened to somebody else,
p118
aVbut it's going to be worth your time."
p119
aVA well told promise
p120
aVis like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot
p121
aVand propels you forward through the story
p122
aVto the end.
p123
aa(lp124
VIn 2008,
p125
aVI pushed all the theories that I had on story at the time
p126
aVto the limits of my understanding on this project.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Video) (Mechanical Sounds)
p129
aV\u266b And that is all \u266b
p130
aV\u266b that love's about \u266b
p131
aV\u266b And we'll recall \u266b
p132
aV\u266b when time runs out \u266b
p133
aV\u266b That it only \u266b
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VAS: Storytelling without dialogue.
p137
aVIt's the purest form of cinematic storytelling.
p138
aVIt's the most inclusive approach you can take.
p139
aVIt confirmed something I really had a hunch on,
p140
aVis that the audience
p141
aVactually wants to work for their meal.
p142
aVThey just don't want to know that they're doing that.
p143
aVThat's your job as a storyteller,
p144
aVis to hide the fact
p145
aVthat you're making them work for their meal.
p146
aVWe're born problem solvers.
p147
aVWe're compelled to deduce
p148
aVand to deduct,
p149
aVbecause that's what we do in real life.
p150
aVIt's this well-organized absence of information
p151
aVthat draws us in.
p152
aVThere's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy.
p153
aVIt's not just that they're damn cute;
p154
aVit's because they can't completely express
p155
aVwhat they're thinking and what their intentions are.
p156
aVAnd it's like a magnet.
p157
aVWe can't stop ourselves
p158
aVfrom wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in.
p159
aa(lp160
VI first started
p161
aVreally understanding this storytelling device
p162
aVwhen I was writing with Bob Peterson on "Finding Nemo."
p163
aVAnd we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two.
p164
aVMake the audience put things together.
p165
aVDon't give them four,
p166
aVgive them two plus two.
p167
aVThe elements you provide and the order you place them in
p168
aVis crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience.
p169
aVEditors and screenwriters have known this all along.
p170
aVIt's the invisible application
p171
aVthat holds our attention to story.
p172
aVI don't mean to make it sound
p173
aVlike this is an actual exact science, it's not.
p174
aVThat's what's so special about stories,
p175
aVthey're not a widget, they aren't exact.
p176
aVStories are inevitable, if they're good,
p177
aVbut they're not predictable.
p178
aa(lp179
VI took a seminar in this year
p180
aVwith an acting teacher named Judith Weston.
p181
aVAnd I learned a key insight to character.
p182
aVShe believed that all well-drawn characters
p183
aVhave a spine.
p184
aVAnd the idea is that the character has an inner motor,
p185
aVa dominant, unconscious goal that they're striving for,
p186
aVan itch that they can't scratch.
p187
aVShe gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone,
p188
aVAl Pacino's character in "The Godfather,"
p189
aVand that probably his spine
p190
aVwas to please his father.
p191
aVAnd it's something that always drove all his choices.
p192
aVEven after his father died,
p193
aVhe was still trying to scratch that itch.
p194
aVI took to this like a duck to water.
p195
aVWall-E's was to find the beauty.
p196
aVMarlin's, the father in "Finding Nemo,"
p197
aVwas to prevent harm.
p198
aVAnd Woody's was to do what was best for his child.
p199
aVAnd these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices.
p200
aVSometimes you can make some horrible choices with them.
p201
aa(lp202
VI'm really blessed to be a parent,
p203
aVand watching my children grow, I really firmly believe
p204
aVthat you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way,
p205
aVand you don't have any say about it,
p206
aVand there's no changing it.
p207
aVAll you can do is learn to recognize it
p208
aVand own it.
p209
aVAnd some of us are born with temperaments that are positive,
p210
aVsome are negative.
p211
aVBut a major threshold is passed
p212
aVwhen you mature enough
p213
aVto acknowledge what drives you
p214
aVand to take the wheel and steer it.
p215
aVAs parents, you're always learning who your children are.
p216
aVThey're learning who they are.
p217
aVAnd you're still learning who you are.
p218
aVSo we're all learning all the time.
p219
aVAnd that's why change is fundamental in story.
p220
aVIf things go static, stories die,
p221
aVbecause life is never static.
p222
aa(lp223
VIn 1998,
p224
aVI had finished writing "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life"
p225
aVand I was completely hooked on screenwriting.
p226
aVSo I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could.
p227
aVSo I researched everything I possibly could.
p228
aVAnd I finally came across this fantastic quote
p229
aVby a British playwright, William Archer:
p230
aV"Drama is anticipation
p231
aVmingled with uncertainty."
p232
aVIt's an incredibly insightful definition.
p233
aa(lp234
VWhen you're telling a story,
p235
aVhave you constructed anticipation?
p236
aVIn the short-term, have you made me want to know
p237
aVwhat will happen next?
p238
aVBut more importantly,
p239
aVhave you made me want to know
p240
aVhow it will all conclude in the long-term?
p241
aVHave you constructed honest conflicts
p242
aVwith truth that creates doubt
p243
aVin what the outcome might be?
p244
aVAn example would be in "Finding Nemo,"
p245
aVin the short tension, you were always worried,
p246
aVwould Dory's short-term memory
p247
aVmake her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin.
p248
aVBut under that was this global tension
p249
aVof will we ever find Nemo
p250
aVin this huge, vast ocean?
p251
aa(lp252
VIn our earliest days at Pixar,
p253
aVbefore we truly understood the invisible workings of story,
p254
aVwe were simply a group of guys just going on our gut, going on our instincts.
p255
aVAnd it's interesting to see
p256
aVhow that led us places
p257
aVthat were actually pretty good.
p258
aVYou've got to remember that in this time of year,
p259
aV1993,
p260
aVwhat was considered a successful animated picture
p261
aVwas "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast,"
p262
aV"Aladdin," "Lion King."
p263
aVSo when we pitched "Toy Story" to Tom Hanks for the first time,
p264
aVhe walked in and he said,
p265
aV"You don't want me to sing, do you?"
p266
aVAnd I thought that epitomized perfectly
p267
aVwhat everybody thought animation had to be at the time.
p268
aVBut we really wanted to prove
p269
aVthat you could tell stories completely different in animation.
p270
aa(lp271
VWe didn't have any influence then,
p272
aVso we had a little secret list of rules
p273
aVthat we kept to ourselves.
p274
aVAnd they were: No songs,
p275
aVno "I want" moment,
p276
aVno happy village,
p277
aVno love story.
p278
aVAnd the irony is that, in the first year,
p279
aVour story was not working at all
p280
aVand Disney was panicking.
p281
aVSo they privately got advice
p282
aVfrom a famous lyricist, who I won't name,
p283
aVand he faxed them some suggestions.
p284
aVAnd we got a hold of that fax.
p285
aVAnd the fax said,
p286
aVthere should be songs,
p287
aVthere should be an "I want" song,
p288
aVthere should be a happy village song,
p289
aVthere should be a love story
p290
aVand there should be a villain.
p291
aVAnd thank goodness
p292
aVwe were just too young, rebellious and contrarian at the time.
p293
aVThat just gave us more determination
p294
aVto prove that you could build a better story.
p295
aVAnd a year after that, we did conquer it.
p296
aVAnd it just went to prove
p297
aVthat storytelling has guidelines,
p298
aVnot hard, fast rules.
p299
aa(lp300
VAnother fundamental thing we learned
p301
aVwas about liking your main character.
p302
aVAnd we had naively thought,
p303
aVwell Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end,
p304
aVso you've got to start from someplace.
p305
aVSo let's make him selfish. And this is what you get.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Voice Over) Woody: What do you think you're doing?
p308
aVOff the bed.
p309
aVHey, off the bed!
p310
aVMr. Potato Head: You going to make us, Woody?
p311
aVWoody: No, he is.
p312
aVSlinky? Slink ... Slinky!
p313
aVGet up here and do your job.
p314
aVAre you deaf?
p315
aVI said, take care of them.
p316
aVSlinky: I'm sorry, Woody,
p317
aVbut I have to agree with them.
p318
aVI don't think what you did was right.
p319
aVWoody: What? Am I hearing correctly?
p320
aVYou don't think I was right?
p321
aVWho said your job was to think, Spring Wiener?
p322
aa(lp323
VAS: So how do you make a selfish character likable?
p324
aVWe realized, you can make him kind,
p325
aVgenerous, funny, considerate,
p326
aVas long as one condition is met for him,
p327
aVis that he stays the top toy.
p328
aVAnd that's what it really is,
p329
aVis that we all live life conditionally.
p330
aVWe're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along,
p331
aVas long as certain conditions are met.
p332
aVAfter that, all bets are off.
p333
aVAnd before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career,
p334
aVI can now see key things that happened in my youth
p335
aVthat really sort of opened my eyes
p336
aVto certain things about story.
p337
aa(lp338
VIn 1986, I truly understood the notion
p339
aVof story having a theme.
p340
aVAnd that was the year that they restored and re-released
p341
aV"Lawrence of Arabia."
p342
aVAnd I saw that thing seven times in one month.
p343
aVI couldn't get enough of it.
p344
aVI could just tell there was a grand design under it \u2014
p345
aVin every shot, every scene, every line.
p346
aVYet, on the surface it just seemed
p347
aVto be depicting his historical lineage
p348
aVof what went on.
p349
aVYet, there was something more being said. What exactly was it?
p350
aVAnd it wasn't until, on one of my later viewings,
p351
aVthat the veil was lifted
p352
aVand it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desert
p353
aVand he's reached the Suez Canal,
p354
aVand I suddenly got it.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Video) Boy: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
p357
aVCyclist: Who are you?
p358
aVWho are you?
p359
aa(lp360
VAS: That was the theme: Who are you?
p361
aVHere were all these seemingly disparate
p362
aVevents and dialogues
p363
aVthat just were chronologically telling the history of him,
p364
aVbut underneath it was a constant,
p365
aVa guideline, a road map.
p366
aVEverything Lawrence did in that movie
p367
aVwas an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world.
p368
aVA strong theme is always running through
p369
aVa well-told story.
p370
aa(lp371
VWhen I was five,
p372
aVI was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient
p373
aVthat I feel a story should have,
p374
aVbut is rarely invoked.
p375
aVAnd this is what my mother took me to when I was five.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Video) Thumper: Come on. It's all right.
p378
aVLook.
p379
aVThe water's stiff.
p380
aVBambi: Yippee!
p381
aVThumper: Some fun,
p382
aVhuh, Bambi?
p383
aVCome on. Get up.
p384
aVLike this.
p385
aVHa ha. No, no, no.
p386
aa(lp387
VAS: I walked out of there
p388
aVwide-eyed with wonder.
p389
aVAnd that's what I think the magic ingredient is,
p390
aVthe secret sauce,
p391
aVis can you invoke wonder.
p392
aVWonder is honest, it's completely innocent.
p393
aVIt can't be artificially evoked.
p394
aVFor me, there's no greater ability
p395
aVthan the gift of another human being giving you that feeling \u2014
p396
aVto hold them still just for a brief moment in their day
p397
aVand have them surrender to wonder.
p398
aVWhen it's tapped, the affirmation of being alive,
p399
aVit reaches you almost to a cellular level.
p400
aVAnd when an artist does that to another artist,
p401
aVit's like you're compelled to pass it on.
p402
aVIt's like a dormant command
p403
aVthat suddenly is activated in you, like a call to Devil's Tower.
p404
aVDo unto others what's been done to you.
p405
aVThe best stories infuse wonder.
p406
aa(lp407
VWhen I was four years old,
p408
aVI have a vivid memory
p409
aVof finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle
p410
aVand asking my dad what they were.
p411
aVAnd he said I had a matching pair like that on my head,
p412
aVbut I couldn't see them because of my hair.
p413
aVAnd he explained that when I was born,
p414
aVI was born premature,
p415
aVthat I came out much too early,
p416
aVand I wasn't fully baked;
p417
aVI was very, very sick.
p418
aVAnd when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth,
p419
aVhe looked straight at my mom and said,
p420
aV"He's not going to live."
p421
aVAnd I was in the hospital for months.
p422
aVAnd many blood transfusions later,
p423
aVI lived,
p424
aVand that made me special.
p425
aa(lp426
VI don't know if I really believe that.
p427
aVI don't know if my parents really believe that,
p428
aVbut I didn't want to prove them wrong.
p429
aVWhatever I ended up being good at,
p430
aVI would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given.
p431
aa(lp432
V(Video) (Crying)
p433
aVMarlin: There, there, there.
p434
aVIt's okay, daddy's here.
p435
aVDaddy's got you.
p436
aVI promise,
p437
aVI will never let anything happen to you, Nemo.
p438
aa(lp439
VAS: And that's the first story lesson I ever learned.
p440
aVUse what you know. Draw from it.
p441
aVIt doesn't always mean plot or fact.
p442
aVIt means capturing a truth from your experiencing it,
p443
aVexpressing values you personally feel
p444
aVdeep down in your core.
p445
aVAnd that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you
p446
aVhere at TEDTalk today.
p447
aa(lp448
VThank you.

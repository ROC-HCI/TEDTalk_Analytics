VIn the northwest corner of the United States,
p5
aVright up near the Canadian border,
p6
aVthere's a little town called Libby, Montana,
p7
aVand it's surrounded by pine trees and lakes
p8
aVand just amazing wildlife
p9
aVand these enormous trees that scream up into the sky.
p10
aVAnd in there is a little town called Libby,
p11
aVwhich I visited, which feels kind of lonely,
p12
aVa little isolated.
p13
aVAnd in Libby, Montana, there's a rather unusual woman
p14
aVnamed Gayla Benefield.
p15
aVShe always felt a little bit of an outsider,
p16
aValthough she's been there almost all her life,
p17
aVa woman of Russian extraction.
p18
aVShe told me when she went to school,
p19
aVshe was the only girl who ever chose
p20
aVto do mechanical drawing.
p21
aVLater in life, she got a job going house to house
p22
aVreading utility meters \u2014 gas meters, electricity meters.
p23
aVAnd she was doing the work in the middle of the day,
p24
aVand one thing particularly caught her notice, which was,
p25
aVin the middle of the day she met a lot of men
p26
aVwho were at home, middle aged, late middle aged,
p27
aVand a lot of them seemed to be on oxygen tanks.
p28
aVIt struck her as strange.
p29
aVThen, a few years later, her father died at the age of 59,
p30
aVfive days before he was due to receive his pension.
p31
aVHe'd been a miner.
p32
aVShe thought he must just have been worn out by the work.
p33
aVBut then a few years later, her mother died,
p34
aVand that seemed stranger still,
p35
aVbecause her mother came from a long line of people
p36
aVwho just seemed to live forever.
p37
aVIn fact, Gayla's uncle is still alive to this day,
p38
aVand learning how to waltz.
p39
aVIt didn't make sense that Gayla's mother
p40
aVshould die so young.
p41
aVIt was an anomaly, and she kept puzzling over anomalies.
p42
aVAnd as she did, other ones came to mind.
p43
aVShe remembered, for example,
p44
aVwhen her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital,
p45
aVand she had a lot of x-rays,
p46
aVand two of them were leg x-rays, which made sense,
p47
aVbut six of them were chest x-rays, which didn't.
p48
aVShe puzzled and puzzled over every piece
p49
aVof her life and her parents' life,
p50
aVtrying to understand what she was seeing.
p51
aVShe thought about her town.
p52
aVThe town had a vermiculite mine in it.
p53
aVVermiculite was used for soil conditioners,
p54
aVto make plants grow faster and better.
p55
aVVermiculite was used to insulate lofts,
p56
aVhuge amounts of it put under the roof
p57
aVto keep houses warm during the long Montana winters.
p58
aVVermiculite was in the playground.
p59
aVIt was in the football ground.
p60
aVIt was in the skating rink.
p61
aVWhat she didn't learn until she started working this problem
p62
aVis vermiculite is a very toxic form of asbestos.
p63
aVWhen she figured out the puzzle,
p64
aVshe started telling everyone she could
p65
aVwhat had happened, what had been done to her parents
p66
aVand to the people that she saw on oxygen tanks
p67
aVat home in the afternoons.
p68
aVBut she was really amazed.
p69
aVShe thought, when everybody knows, they'll want to do something,
p70
aVbut actually nobody wanted to know.
p71
aVIn fact, she became so annoying
p72
aVas she kept insisting on telling this story
p73
aVto her neighbors, to her friends, to other people in the community,
p74
aVthat eventually a bunch of them got together
p75
aVand they made a bumper sticker,
p76
aVwhich they proudly displayed on their cars, which said,
p77
aV"Yes, I'm from Libby, Montana,
p78
aVand no, I don't have asbestosis."
p79
aVBut Gayla didn't stop. She kept doing research.
p80
aVThe advent of the Internet definitely helped her.
p81
aVShe talked to anybody she could.
p82
aVShe argued and argued, and finally she struck lucky
p83
aVwhen a researcher came through town
p84
aVstudying the history of mines in the area,
p85
aVand she told him her story, and at first, of course,
p86
aVlike everyone, he didn't believe her,
p87
aVbut he went back to Seattle and he did his own research
p88
aVand he realized that she was right.
p89
aVSo now she had an ally.
p90
aVNevertheless, people still didn't want to know.
p91
aVThey said things like, "Well, if it were really dangerous,
p92
aVsomeone would have told us."
p93
aV"If that's really why everyone was dying,
p94
aVthe doctors would have told us."
p95
aVSome of the guys used to very heavy jobs said,
p96
aV"I don't want to be a victim.
p97
aVI can't possibly be a victim, and anyway,
p98
aVevery industry has its accidents."
p99
aVBut still Gayla went on, and finally she succeeded
p100
aVin getting a federal agency to come to town
p101
aVand to screen the inhabitants of the town \u2014
p102
aV15,000 people \u2014 and what they discovered
p103
aVwas that the town had a mortality rate
p104
aV80 times higher than anywhere in the United States.
p105
aVThat was in 2002, and even at that moment,
p106
aVno one raised their hand to say, "Gayla,
p107
aVlook in the playground where your grandchildren are playing.
p108
aVIt's lined with vermiculite."
p109
aVThis wasn't ignorance.
p110
aVIt was willful blindness.
p111
aVWillful blindness is a legal concept which means,
p112
aVif there's information that you could know and you should know
p113
aVbut you somehow manage not to know,
p114
aVthe law deems that you're willfully blind.
p115
aVYou have chosen not to know.
p116
aVThere's a lot of willful blindness around these days.
p117
aVYou can see willful blindness in banks,
p118
aVwhen thousands of people sold mortgages to people
p119
aVwho couldn't afford them.
p120
aVYou could see them in banks
p121
aVwhen interest rates were manipulated
p122
aVand everyone around knew what was going on,
p123
aVbut everyone studiously ignored it.
p124
aVYou can see willful blindness in the Catholic Church,
p125
aVwhere decades of child abuse went ignored.
p126
aVYou could see willful blindness
p127
aVin the run-up to the Iraq War.
p128
aVWillful blindness exists on epic scales like those,
p129
aVand it also exists on very small scales,
p130
aVin people's families, in people's homes and communities,
p131
aVand particularly in organizations and institutions.
p132
aVCompanies that have been studied for willful blindness
p133
aVcan be asked questions like,
p134
aV"Are there issues at work
p135
aVthat people are afraid to raise?"
p136
aVAnd when academics have done studies like this
p137
aVof corporations in the United States,
p138
aVwhat they find is 85 percent of people say yes.
p139
aVEighty-five percent of people know there's a problem,
p140
aVbut they won't say anything.
p141
aVAnd when I duplicated the research in Europe,
p142
aVasking all the same questions,
p143
aVI found exactly the same number.
p144
aVEighty-five percent. That's a lot of silence.
p145
aVIt's a lot of blindness.
p146
aVAnd what's really interesting is that when I go to companies in Switzerland,
p147
aVthey tell me, "This is a uniquely Swiss problem."
p148
aVAnd when I go to Germany, they say, "Oh yes, this is the German disease."
p149
aVAnd when I go to companies in England, they say,
p150
aV"Oh, yeah, the British are really bad at this."
p151
aVAnd the truth is, this is a human problem.
p152
aVWe're all, under certain circumstances, willfully blind.
p153
aVWhat the research shows is that some people are blind
p154
aVout of fear. They're afraid of retaliation.
p155
aVAnd some people are blind because they think, well,
p156
aVseeing anything is just futile.
p157
aVNothing's ever going to change.
p158
aVIf we make a protest, if we protest against the Iraq War,
p159
aVnothing changes, so why bother?
p160
aVBetter not to see this stuff at all.
p161
aVAnd the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time
p162
aVis people say, "Well, you know,
p163
aVthe people who do see, they're whistleblowers,
p164
aVand we all know what happens to them."
p165
aVSo there's this profound mythology around whistleblowers
p166
aVwhich says, first of all, they're all crazy.
p167
aVBut what I've found going around the world
p168
aVand talking to whistleblowers is, actually,
p169
aVthey're very loyal and quite often very conservative people.
p170
aVThey're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for,
p171
aVand the reason that they speak up,
p172
aVthe reason they insist on seeing,
p173
aVis because they care so much about the institution
p174
aVand want to keep it healthy.
p175
aVAnd the other thing that people often say
p176
aVabout whistleblowers is, "Well, there's no point,
p177
aVbecause you see what happens to them.
p178
aVThey are crushed.
p179
aVNobody would want to go through something like that."
p180
aVAnd yet, when I talk to whistleblowers,
p181
aVthe recurrent tone that I hear is pride.
p182
aVI think of Joe Darby.
p183
aVWe all remember the photographs of Abu Ghraib,
p184
aVwhich so shocked the world and showed the kind of war
p185
aVthat was being fought in Iraq.
p186
aVBut I wonder who remembers Joe Darby,
p187
aVthe very obedient, good soldier
p188
aVwho found those photographs and handed them in.
p189
aVAnd he said, "You know, I'm not the kind of guy
p190
aVto rat people out, but some things just cross the line.
p191
aVIgnorance is bliss, they say,
p192
aVbut you can't put up with things like this."
p193
aVI talked to Steve Bolsin, a British doctor,
p194
aVwho fought for five years to draw attention
p195
aVto a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies.
p196
aVAnd I asked him why he did it, and he said,
p197
aV"Well, it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it.
p198
aVShe came up to me one night, and she just said,
p199
aV'Dad, you can't let the kids die.'"
p200
aVOr I think of Cynthia Thomas,
p201
aVa really loyal army daughter and army wife,
p202
aVwho, as she saw her friends and relations
p203
aVcoming back from the Iraq War, was so shocked
p204
aVby their mental condition
p205
aVand the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge
p206
aVpost-traumatic stress syndrome
p207
aVthat she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town
p208
aVto give them legal, psychological and medical assistance.
p209
aVAnd she said to me, she said, "You know, Margaret,
p210
aVI always used to say I didn't know what I wanted to be
p211
aVwhen I grow up.
p212
aVBut I've found myself in this cause,
p213
aVand I'll never be the same."
p214
aVWe all enjoy so many freedoms today,
p215
aVhard-won freedoms:
p216
aVthe freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship,
p217
aVa freedom that wasn't here the last time I came to Hungary;
p218
aVa freedom to vote, which women in particular
p219
aVhad to fight so hard for;
p220
aVthe freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures
p221
aVand sexual orientation to live the way that they want.
p222
aVBut freedom doesn't exist if you don't use it,
p223
aVand what whistleblowers do,
p224
aVand what people like Gayla Benefield do
p225
aVis they use the freedom that they have.
p226
aVAnd what they're very prepared to do is recognize
p227
aVthat yes, this is going to be an argument,
p228
aVand yes I'm going to have a lot of rows
p229
aVwith my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends,
p230
aVbut I'm going to become very good at this conflict.
p231
aVI'm going to take on the naysayers,
p232
aVbecause they'll make my argument better and stronger.
p233
aVI can collaborate with my opponents
p234
aVto become better at what I do.
p235
aVThese are people of immense persistence,
p236
aVincredible patience, and an absolute determination
p237
aVnot to be blind and not to be silent.
p238
aVWhen I went to Libby, Montana,
p239
aVI visited the asbestosis clinic
p240
aVthat Gayla Benefield brought into being,
p241
aVa place where at first some of the people
p242
aVwho wanted help and needed medical attention
p243
aVwent in the back door
p244
aVbecause they didn't want to acknowledge
p245
aVthat she'd been right.
p246
aVI sat in a diner, and I watched
p247
aVas trucks drove up and down the highway,
p248
aVcarting away the earth out of gardens
p249
aVand replacing it with fresh, uncontaminated soil.
p250
aVI took my 12-year-old daughter with me,
p251
aVbecause I really wanted her to meet Gayla.
p252
aVAnd she said, "Why? What's the big deal?"
p253
aVI said, "She's not a movie star,
p254
aVand she's not a celebrity, and she's not an expert,
p255
aVand Gayla's the first person who'd say
p256
aVshe's not a saint.
p257
aVThe really important thing about Gayla
p258
aVis she is ordinary.
p259
aVShe's like you, and she's like me.
p260
aVShe had freedom, and she was ready to use it."
p261
aVThank you very much.

VSo, a few years ago I was at JFK Airport
p5
aVabout to get on a flight,
p6
aVwhen I was approached by two women
p7
aVwho I do not think would be insulted
p8
aVto hear themselves described
p9
aVas tiny old tough-talking Italian-American broads.
p10
aa(lp11
VThe taller one, who is like up here,
p12
aVshe comes marching up to me, and she goes,
p13
aV"Honey, I gotta ask you something.
p14
aVYou got something to do with that whole
p15
aV'Eat, Pray, Love' thing that's been going on lately?"
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I said, "Yes, I did."
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd she smacks her friend and she goes,
p20
aV"See, I told you, I said, that's that girl.
p21
aVThat's that girl who wrote that book
p22
aVbased on that movie."
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VSo that's who I am.
p26
aVAnd believe me, I'm extremely grateful to be that person,
p27
aVbecause that whole "Eat, Pray, Love" thing
p28
aVwas a huge break for me.
p29
aVBut it also left me in a really tricky position
p30
aVmoving forward as an author
p31
aVtrying to figure out how in the world
p32
aVI was ever going to write a book again
p33
aVthat would ever please anybody,
p34
aVbecause I knew well in advance
p35
aVthat all of those people who had adored "Eat, Pray, Love"
p36
aVwere going to be incredibly disappointed
p37
aVin whatever I wrote next
p38
aVbecause it wasn't going to be "Eat, Pray, Love,"
p39
aVand all of those people who had hated "Eat, Pray, Love"
p40
aVwere going to be incredibly disappointed
p41
aVin whatever I wrote next
p42
aVbecause it would provide evidence that I still lived.
p43
aVSo I knew that I had no way to win,
p44
aVand knowing that I had no way to win
p45
aVmade me seriously consider for a while
p46
aVjust quitting the game
p47
aVand moving to the country to raise corgis.
p48
aVBut if I had done that, if I had given up writing,
p49
aVI would have lost my beloved vocation,
p50
aVso I knew that the task was that I had to find
p51
aVsome way to gin up the inspiration
p52
aVto write the next book
p53
aVregardless of its inevitable negative outcome.
p54
aVIn other words, I had to find a way to make sure
p55
aVthat my creativity survived its own success.
p56
aVAnd I did, in the end, find that inspiration,
p57
aVbut I found it in the most unlikely
p58
aVand unexpected place.
p59
aVI found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life
p60
aVabout how creativity can survive its own failure.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo just to back up and explain,
p63
aVthe only thing I have ever wanted to be
p64
aVfor my whole life was a writer.
p65
aVI wrote all through childhood, all through adolescence,
p66
aVby the time I was a teenager I was sending
p67
aVmy very bad stories to The New Yorker,
p68
aVhoping to be discovered.
p69
aVAfter college, I got a job as a diner waitress,
p70
aVkept working, kept writing,
p71
aVkept trying really hard to get published,
p72
aVand failing at it.
p73
aVI failed at getting published
p74
aVfor almost six years.
p75
aVSo for almost six years, every single day,
p76
aVI had nothing but rejection letters
p77
aVwaiting for me in my mailbox.
p78
aVAnd it was devastating every single time,
p79
aVand every single time, I had to ask myself
p80
aVif I should just quit while I was behind
p81
aVand give up and spare myself this pain.
p82
aVBut then I would find my resolve,
p83
aVand always in the same way,
p84
aVby saying, "I'm not going to quit,
p85
aVI'm going home."
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd you have to understand that for me,
p88
aVgoing home did not mean returning to my family's farm.
p89
aVFor me, going home
p90
aVmeant returning to the work of writing
p91
aVbecause writing was my home,
p92
aVbecause I loved writing more than I hated failing at writing,
p93
aVwhich is to say that I loved writing
p94
aVmore than I loved my own ego,
p95
aVwhich is ultimately to say
p96
aVthat I loved writing more than I loved myself.
p97
aVAnd that's how I pushed through it.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut the weird thing is that 20 years later,
p100
aVduring the crazy ride of "Eat, Pray, Love,"
p101
aVI found myself identifying all over again
p102
aVwith that unpublished young diner waitress
p103
aVwho I used to be, thinking about her constantly,
p104
aVand feeling like I was her again,
p105
aVwhich made no rational sense whatsoever
p106
aVbecause our lives could not have been more different.
p107
aVShe had failed constantly.
p108
aVI had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation.
p109
aVWe had nothing in common.
p110
aVWhy did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again?
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd it was only when I was trying to unthread that
p113
aVthat I finally began to comprehend
p114
aVthe strange and unlikely psychological connection
p115
aVin our lives between the way we experience great failure
p116
aVand the way we experience great success.
p117
aVSo think of it like this:
p118
aVFor most of your life, you live out your existence
p119
aVhere in the middle of the chain of human experience
p120
aVwhere everything is normal and reassuring and regular,
p121
aVbut failure catapults you abruptly way out over here
p122
aVinto the blinding darkness of disappointment.
p123
aVSuccess catapults you just as abruptly but just as far
p124
aVway out over here
p125
aVinto the equally blinding glare
p126
aVof fame and recognition and praise.
p127
aVAnd one of these fates
p128
aVis objectively seen by the world as bad,
p129
aVand the other one is objectively seen by the world as good,
p130
aVbut your subconscious is completely incapable
p131
aVof discerning the difference between bad and good.
p132
aVThe only thing that it is capable of feeling
p133
aVis the absolute value of this emotional equation,
p134
aVthe exact distance that you have been flung
p135
aVfrom yourself.
p136
aVAnd there's a real equal danger in both cases
p137
aVof getting lost out there
p138
aVin the hinterlands of the psyche.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut in both cases, it turns out that there is
p141
aValso the same remedy for self-restoration,
p142
aVand that is that you have got to find your way back home again
p143
aVas swiftly and smoothly as you can,
p144
aVand if you're wondering what your home is,
p145
aVhere's a hint:
p146
aVYour home is whatever in this world you love
p147
aVmore than you love yourself.
p148
aVSo that might be creativity, it might be family,
p149
aVit might be invention, adventure,
p150
aVfaith, service, it might be raising corgis,
p151
aVI don't know, your home is that thing
p152
aVto which you can dedicate your energies
p153
aVwith such singular devotion
p154
aVthat the ultimate results become inconsequential.
p155
aa(lp156
VFor me, that home has always been writing.
p157
aVSo after the weird, disorienting success
p158
aVthat I went through with "Eat, Pray, Love,"
p159
aVI realized that all I had to do was exactly
p160
aVthe same thing that I used to have to do all the time
p161
aVwhen I was an equally disoriented failure.
p162
aVI had to get my ass back to work,
p163
aVand that's what I did, and that's how, in 2010,
p164
aVI was able to publish the dreaded follow-up
p165
aVto "Eat, Pray, Love."
p166
aVAnd you know what happened with that book?
p167
aVIt bombed, and I was fine.
p168
aVActually, I kind of felt bulletproof,
p169
aVbecause I knew that I had broken the spell
p170
aVand I had found my way back home
p171
aVto writing for the sheer devotion of it.
p172
aVAnd I stayed in my home of writing after that,
p173
aVand I wrote another book that just came out last year
p174
aVand that one was really beautifully received,
p175
aVwhich is very nice, but not my point.
p176
aVMy point is that I'm writing another one now,
p177
aVand I'll write another book after that
p178
aVand another and another and another
p179
aVand many of them will fail,
p180
aVand some of them might succeed,
p181
aVbut I will always be safe
p182
aVfrom the random hurricanes of outcome
p183
aVas long as I never forget where I rightfully live.
p184
aa(lp185
VLook, I don't know where you rightfully live,
p186
aVbut I know that there's something in this world
p187
aVthat you love more than you love yourself.
p188
aVSomething worthy, by the way,
p189
aVso addiction and infatuation don't count,
p190
aVbecause we all know that those are not safe places to live. Right?
p191
aVThe only trick is that you've got to identify
p192
aVthe best, worthiest thing that you love most,
p193
aVand then build your house right on top of it
p194
aVand don't budge from it.
p195
aVAnd if you should someday, somehow
p196
aVget vaulted out of your home
p197
aVby either great failure or great success,
p198
aVthen your job is to fight your way back to that home
p199
aVthe only way that it has ever been done,
p200
aVby putting your head down and performing
p201
aVwith diligence and devotion
p202
aVand respect and reverence
p203
aVwhatever the task is that love
p204
aVis calling forth from you next.
p205
aVYou just do that, and keep doing that
p206
aVagain and again and again,
p207
aVand I can absolutely promise you, from long personal experience
p208
aVin every direction, I can assure you
p209
aVthat it's all going to be okay.
p210
aVThank you.

aV(Applause)

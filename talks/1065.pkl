VI'm going to have a pretty simple idea
p5
aVthat I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it,
p6
aVand that is all of us are makers.
p7
aVI really believe that.
p8
aVAll of us are makers.
p9
aVWe're born makers.
p10
aVWe have this ability
p11
aVto make things,
p12
aVto grasp things with our hands.
p13
aVWe use words like "grasp" metaphorically
p14
aVto also think about understanding things.
p15
aVWe don't just live, but we make.
p16
aVWe create things.
p17
aVWell I'm going to show you a group of makers
p18
aVfrom Maker Faire and various places.
p19
aVIt doesn't come out particularly well,
p20
aVbut that's a particularly tall bicycle.
p21
aVIt's a scraper bike; it's called \u2014
p22
aVfrom Oakland.
p23
aVAnd this is a particularly small scooter
p24
aVfor a gentleman of this size.
p25
aVBut he's trying to power it, or motorize it,
p26
aVwith a drill.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVAnd the question he had is,
p29
aV"Can I do it? Can it be done?"
p30
aVApparently it can.
p31
aVSo makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs;
p32
aVthey're people who love
p33
aVdoing what they do.
p34
aVThey don't always even know why they're doing it.
p35
aa(lp36
VWe have begun organizing makers
p37
aVat our Maker Faire.
p38
aVThere was one held in Detroit here last summer,
p39
aVand it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford.
p40
aVBut we hold them in San Francisco \u2014
p41
aV(Applause)
p42
aV\u2014 and in New York.
p43
aVAnd it's a fabulous event
p44
aVto just meet and talk to these people who make things
p45
aVand are there to just show them to you and talk about them
p46
aVand have a great conversation.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Video) Guy: I might get one of those.
p49
aa(lp50
VDale Dougherty: These are electric muffins.
p51
aa(lp52
VGuy: Where did you guys get those?
p53
aa(lp54
VMuffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.)
p55
aa(lp56
VDD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out.
p57
aVWe got there first.
p58
aa(lp59
VLady: Will you glide with us?
p60
aa(lp61
VDD: This is something I call "swinging in the rain."
p62
aVAnd you can barely see it,
p63
aVbut it's \u2014 a controller at top cycles the water to fall
p64
aVjust before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc.
p65
aVSo imagine a kid: "Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?
p66
aVNo, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?"
p67
aVThat's the experience of a clever ride.
p68
aVAnd of course, we have fashion.
p69
aVPeople are remaking things into fashion.
p70
aVI don't know if this is called a basket-bra,
p71
aVbut it ought to be something like that.
p72
aVWe have art students getting together,
p73
aVtaking old radiator parts
p74
aVand doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it.
p75
aVThey did that in the summer, and it was very warm.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow this one takes a little bit of explaining.
p78
aVYou know what those are, right?
p79
aVBilly-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that.
p80
aVNow the background is \u2014 the guy who did this is a physicist.
p81
aVAnd here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Video) Richard Carter: I'm Richard Carter,
p84
aVand this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.
p85
aa(lp86
VChoir: \u266b When you hold me in your arms \u266b
p87
aa(lp88
VDD: This is all computer-controlled
p89
aVin an old Volvo.
p90
aa(lp91
VChoir: \u266b I'm hooked on a feelin' \u266b
p92
aV\u266b I'm high on believin' \u266b
p93
aV\u266b That you're in love with me \u266b
p94
aa(lp95
VDD: So Richard came up from Houston last year
p96
aVto visit us in Detroit here
p97
aVand show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.
p98
aVSo, are you a maker?
p99
aVHow many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand?
p100
aVThat's a pretty good \u2014
p101
aVbut there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers.
p102
aVAnd again, think about it.
p103
aVYou're makers of food; you're makers of shelter;
p104
aVyou're makers of lots of different things,
p105
aVand partly what interests me today
p106
aVis you're makers of your own world,
p107
aVand particularly the role that technology has
p108
aVin your life.
p109
aVYou're really a driver or a passenger \u2014
p110
aVto use a Volkswagen phrase.
p111
aVMakers are in control.
p112
aVThat's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do.
p113
aVThey want to figure out how things work;
p114
aVthey want to get access to it;
p115
aVand they want to control it.
p116
aVThey want to use it to their own purpose.
p117
aa(lp118
VMakers today, to some degree, are out on the edge.
p119
aVThey're not mainstream.
p120
aVThey're a little bit radical.
p121
aVThey're a bit subversive in what they do.
p122
aVBut at one time,
p123
aVit was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker.
p124
aVIt was not something you'd even remark upon.
p125
aVAnd I found this old video.
p126
aVAnd I'll tell you more about it, but just ...
p127
aa(lp128
V(Music)
p129
aa(lp130
V(Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are,
p131
aVwe are makers.
p132
aVWith our strengths and our minds and spirit,
p133
aVwe gather, we form, and we fashion.
p134
aVMakers and shapers
p135
aVand put-it-togetherers.
p136
aa(lp137
VDD: So it goes on to show you
p138
aVpeople making things out of wood,
p139
aVa grandfather making a ship in a bottle,
p140
aVa woman making a pie \u2014
p141
aVsomewhat standard fare of the day.
p142
aVBut it was a sense of pride
p143
aVthat we made things,
p144
aVthat the world around us was made by us.
p145
aVIt didn't just exist.
p146
aVWe made it, and we were connected to it that way.
p147
aVAnd I think that's tremendously important.
p148
aVNow I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this.
p149
aVThis particular reel \u2014
p150
aVit's an industrial video \u2014
p151
aVbut it was shown in drive-in theaters
p152
aVin 1961 \u2014
p153
aVin the Detroit area, in fact \u2014
p154
aVand it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho."
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVSo I like to think there was something going on there
p157
aVof the new generation of makers
p158
aVcoming out of this, plus "Psycho."
p159
aa(lp160
VThis is Andrew Archer.
p161
aVI met Andrew at one of our community meetings
p162
aVputting together Maker Faire.
p163
aVAndrew had moved to Detroit
p164
aVfrom Duluth, Minnesota.
p165
aVAnd I talked to his mom,
p166
aVand I ended up doing a story on him
p167
aVfor a magazine called Kidrobot.
p168
aVHe's just a kid that grew up
p169
aVplaying with tools instead of toys.
p170
aVHe liked to take things apart.
p171
aVHis mother gave him a part of the garage,
p172
aVand he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff.
p173
aVAnd then he didn't particularly like school that much,
p174
aVbut he got involved in robotics competitions,
p175
aVand he realized he had a talent,
p176
aVand, more importantly, he had a real passion for it.
p177
aVAnd he began building robots.
p178
aVAnd when I sat down next to him,
p179
aVhe was telling me about a company he formed,
p180
aVand he was building some robots for automobile factories
p181
aVto move things around on the factory floor.
p182
aVAnd that's why he moved to Michigan.
p183
aVBut he also moved here
p184
aVto meet other people doing what he's doing.
p185
aVAnd this kind of gets to this important idea today.
p186
aa(lp187
VThis is Jeff and Bilal and several others here
p188
aVin a hackerspace.
p189
aVAnd there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit.
p190
aVAnd there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last.
p191
aVBut these are like clubs \u2014
p192
aVthey're sharing tools, sharing space,
p193
aVsharing expertise in what to make.
p194
aVAnd so it's a very interesting phenomenon
p195
aVthat's going across the world.
p196
aVBut essentially these are people that are playing with technology.
p197
aVLet me say that again: playing.
p198
aVThey don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it.
p199
aVThey're playing
p200
aVto discover what the technology can do,
p201
aVand probably to discover what they can do themselves,
p202
aVwhat their own capabilities are.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow the other thing that I think is taking off,
p205
aVanother reason making is taking off today,
p206
aVis there's some great new tools out there.
p207
aVAnd you can't see this very well on the screen,
p208
aVbut Arduino \u2014 Arduino is an open-source hardware platform.
p209
aVIt's a micro-controller.
p210
aVIf you don't know what those are, they're just the "brains."
p211
aVSo they're the brains of maker projects,
p212
aVand here's an example of one.
p213
aVAnd I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox \u2014
p214
aVso an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino.
p215
aVSo you figure out how to program this,
p216
aVand you put this in your mailbox.
p217
aVAnd when someone opens your mailbox,
p218
aVyou get a notification,
p219
aVan alert message goes to your iPhone.
p220
aVNow that could be a dog door,
p221
aVit could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't,
p222
aVlike a little brother into a little sister's room.
p223
aVThere's all kinds of different things
p224
aVthat you can imagine for that.
p225
aa(lp226
VNow here's something \u2014 a 3D printer.
p227
aVThat's another tool that's really taken off \u2014 really, really interesting.
p228
aVThis is Makerbot.
p229
aVAnd there are industrial versions of this \u2014
p230
aVabout 20,000 dollars.
p231
aVThese guys came up with a kit version
p232
aVfor 750 dollars,
p233
aVand that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks
p234
aVcan get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers.
p235
aVNow they don't know what they want to do with it,
p236
aVbut they're going to figure it out.
p237
aVThey will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it.
p238
aVOne of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade,
p239
aVsome new brackets for the box.
p240
aVWell you printed out the brackets
p241
aVand then replaced the old brackets with the new ones.
p242
aVIsn't that cool?
p243
aa(lp244
VSo makers harvest technology
p245
aVfrom all the places around us.
p246
aVThis is a radar speed detector
p247
aVthat was developed from a Hot Wheels toy.
p248
aVAnd they do interesting things.
p249
aVThey're really creating new areas and exploring areas
p250
aVthat you might only think \u2014
p251
aVthe military is doing drones \u2014
p252
aVwell, there is a whole community of people
p253
aVbuilding autonomous airplanes, or vehicles \u2014
p254
aVsomething that you could program to fly on its own,
p255
aVwithout a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going.
p256
aVFascinating work they're doing.
p257
aa(lp258
VWe just had an issue on space exploration,
p259
aVDIY space exploration.
p260
aVThis is probably the best time in the history of mankind
p261
aVto love space.
p262
aVYou could build your own satellite and get it into space
p263
aVfor like 8,000 dollars.
p264
aVThink how much money and how many years it took NASA
p265
aVto get satellites into space.
p266
aVIn fact, these guys actually work for NASA,
p267
aVand they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components,
p268
aVcheap things that aren't specialized
p269
aVthat they can combine
p270
aVand send up into space.
p271
aa(lp272
VMakers are a source of innovation,
p273
aVand I think it relates back to something
p274
aVlike the birth of the personal computer industry.
p275
aVThis is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers?
p276
aVIt's the Homebrew Computer Club \u2014 just like a hackerspace.
p277
aVAnd he says, "I could go there all day long
p278
aVand talk to people
p279
aVand share ideas for free."
p280
aVWell he did a little bit better than free.
p281
aVBut it's important to understand
p282
aVthat a lot of the origins of our industries \u2014
p283
aVeven like Henry Ford \u2014
p284
aVcome from this idea of playing
p285
aVand figuring things out in groups.
p286
aa(lp287
VWell, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker,
p288
aVI hope I could convince you
p289
aVthat our next generation should be makers,
p290
aVthat kids are particularly interested in this,
p291
aVin this ability to control the physical world
p292
aVand be able to use things like micro-controllers
p293
aVand build robots.
p294
aVAnd we've got to get this into schools,
p295
aVor into communities in many, many ways \u2014
p296
aVthe ability to tinker,
p297
aVto shape and reshape the world around us.
p298
aVThere's a great opportunity today \u2014
p299
aVand that's what I really care about the most.
p300
aVAn the answer to the question: what will America make?
p301
aVIt's more makers.
p302
aa(lp303
VThank you very much.

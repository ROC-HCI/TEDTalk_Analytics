VSo, before I became a dermatologist,
p5
aVI started in general medicine,
p6
aVas most dermatologists do in Britain.
p7
aVAt the end of that time, I went off to Australia,
p8
aVabout 20 years ago.
p9
aVWhat you learn when you go to Australia
p10
aVis the Australians are very competitive.
p11
aVAnd they are not magnanimous in victory.
p12
aVAnd that happened a lot:
p13
aV"You pommies, you can't play cricket, rugby."
p14
aVI could accept that.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut moving into work \u2014
p17
aVand we have each week what's called a journal club,
p18
aVwhen you'd sit down with the other doctors
p19
aVand you'd study a scientific paper
p20
aVin relation to medicine.
p21
aVAnd after week one, it was about cardiovascular mortality,
p22
aVa dry subject \u2014 how many people die of heart disease,
p23
aVwhat the rates are.
p24
aVAnd they were competitive about this:
p25
aV"You pommies, your rates of heart disease are shocking."
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd of course, they were right.
p28
aVAustralians have about a third less heart disease than we do \u2014
p29
aVless deaths from heart attacks, heart failure, less strokes \u2014
p30
aVthey're generally a healthier bunch.
p31
aVAnd of course they said this was because of
p32
aVtheir fine moral standing, their exercise,
p33
aVbecause they're Australians and we're weedy pommies, and so on.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain.
p36
aVWithin Britain, there is a gradient of health \u2014
p37
aVand this is what's called standardized mortality,
p38
aVbasically your chances of dying.
p39
aVThis is looking at data from the paper about 20 years ago,
p40
aVbut it's true today.
p41
aVComparing your rates of dying 50 degrees north \u2014
p42
aVthat's the South, that's London and places \u2014
p43
aVby latitude, and 55 degrees \u2014
p44
aVthe bad news is that's here, Glasgow.
p45
aVI'm from Edinburgh. Worse news, that's even Edinburgh.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo what accounts for this horrible space here
p50
aVbetween us up here in southern Scotland
p51
aVand the South?
p52
aVNow, we know about smoking,
p53
aVdeep-fried Mars bars, chips \u2014 the Glasgow diet.
p54
aVAll of these things.
p55
aVBut this graph is after taking into account
p56
aVall of these known risk factors.
p57
aVThis is after accounting for smoking, social class, diet,
p58
aVall those other known risk factors.
p59
aVWe are left with this missing space
p60
aVof increased deaths the further north you go.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, sunlight, of course, comes into this.
p63
aVAnd vitamin D has had a great deal of press,
p64
aVand a lot of people get concerned about it.
p65
aVAnd we need vitamin D. It's now a requirement that children have a certain amount.
p66
aVMy grandmother grew up in Glasgow,
p67
aVback in the 1920s and '30s when rickets was a real problem
p68
aVand cod liver oil was brought in.
p69
aVAnd that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city.
p70
aVAnd I as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother.
p71
aVI distinctly \u2014 nobody forgets cod liver oil.
p72
aa(lp73
VBut an association: The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are,
p74
aVthe less heart disease they have, the less cancer.
p75
aVThere seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin D is very good for you.
p76
aVAnd it is, to prevent rickets and so on.
p77
aVBut if you give people vitamin D supplements,
p78
aVyou don't change that high rate of heart disease.
p79
aVAnd the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great.
p80
aVSo what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town.
p81
aVIt's not the only reason preventing heart disease.
p82
aVHigh vitamin D levels, I think, are a marker for sunlight exposure,
p83
aVand sunlight exposure, in methods I'm going to show,
p84
aVis good for heart disease.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnyway, I came back from Australia,
p87
aVand despite the obvious risks to my health, I moved to Aberdeen.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVNow, in Aberdeen, I started my dermatology training.
p90
aVBut I also became interested in research,
p91
aVand in particular I became interested in this substance, nitric oxide.
p92
aVNow these three guys up here,
p93
aVFurchgott, Ignarro and Murad,
p94
aVwon the Nobel Prize for medicine back in 1998.
p95
aVAnd they were the first people to describe
p96
aVthis new chemical transmitter, nitric oxide.
p97
aVWhat nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels,
p98
aVso it lowers your blood pressure.
p99
aVIt also dilates the coronary arteries, so it stops angina.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd what was remarkable about it
p102
aVwas in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body,
p103
aVwe thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin,
p104
aVor nerve transmission.
p105
aVVery complex processes with very complex chemicals
p106
aVthat fit into very complex receptors.
p107
aVAnd here's this incredibly simple molecule,
p108
aVa nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together,
p109
aVand yet these are hugely important for [unclear] our low blood pressure,
p110
aVfor neurotransmission, for many, many things,
p111
aVbut particularly cardiovascular health.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd I started doing research, and we found, very excitingly,
p114
aVthat the skin produces nitric oxide.
p115
aVSo it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises.
p116
aVIt arises in the skin.
p117
aVWell, having found that and published that,
p118
aVI thought, well, what's it doing?
p119
aVHow do you have low blood pressure in your skin?
p120
aVIt's not the heart. What do you do?
p121
aa(lp122
VSo I went off to the States, as many people do if they're going to do research,
p123
aVand I spent a few years in Pittsburgh. This is Pittsburgh.
p124
aVAnd I was interested in these really complex systems.
p125
aVWe thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death,
p126
aVand how cells survive, and their resistance to other things.
p127
aVAnd I first off started work in cell culture, growing cells,
p128
aVand then I was using knockout mouse models \u2014
p129
aVmice that couldn't make the gene.
p130
aVWe worked out a mechanism, which \u2014 NO was helping cells survive.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd I then moved back to Edinburgh.
p133
aVAnd in Edinburgh, the experimental animal we use is the medical student.
p134
aVIt's a species close to human,
p135
aVwith several advantages over mice:
p136
aVThey're free, you don't shave them, they feed themselves,
p137
aVand nobody pickets your office saying,
p138
aV"Save the lab medical student."
p139
aVSo they're really an ideal model.
p140
aa(lp141
VBut what we found
p142
aVwas that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice.
p143
aVIt seemed we couldn't turn off the production
p144
aVof nitric oxide in the skin of humans.
p145
aVWe put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it,
p146
aVwe injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd the reason for this, it turned out, after two or three years' work,
p149
aVwas that in the skin we have huge stores
p150
aVnot of nitric oxide, because nitric oxide is a gas,
p151
aVand it's released \u2014 (Poof!) \u2014 and in a few seconds it's away,
p152
aVbut it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide \u2014
p153
aVnitrate, NO3; nitrite, NO2; nitrosothiols.
p154
aVAnd these are more stable,
p155
aVand your skin has got really large stores of NO.
p156
aVAnd we then thought to ourselves, with those big stores,
p157
aVI wonder if sunlight might activate those stores
p158
aVand release them from the skin,
p159
aVwhere the stores are about 10 times as big as what's in the circulation.
p160
aVCould the sun activate those stores into the circulation,
p161
aVand there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system?
p162
aa(lp163
VWell, I'm an experimental dermatologist,
p164
aVso what we did was we thought
p165
aVwe'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight.
p166
aVAnd so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers
p167
aVand we exposed them to ultraviolet light.
p168
aVSo these are kind of sunlamps.
p169
aVNow, what we were careful to do was,
p170
aVvitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays
p171
aVand we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story.
p172
aVSo we used ultraviolet A, which doesn't make vitamin D.
p173
aa(lp174
VWhen we put people under a lamp
p175
aVfor the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh,
p176
aVwhat we produced was, we produced a rise
p177
aVin circulating nitric oxide.
p178
aVSo we put patients with these subjects under the UV,
p179
aVand their NO levels do go up,
p180
aVand their blood pressure goes down.
p181
aVNot by much, as an individual level,
p182
aVbut enough at a population level
p183
aVto shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population.
p184
aVAnd when we shone UV at them,
p185
aVor when we warmed them up to the same level as the lamps,
p186
aVbut didn't actually let the rays hit the skin, this didn't happen.
p187
aVSo this seems to be a feature of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow, we're still collecting data.
p190
aVA few good things here:
p191
aVThis appeared to be more marked in older people.
p192
aVI'm not sure exactly how much.
p193
aVOne of the subjects here was my mother-in-law,
p194
aVand clearly I do not know her age.
p195
aVBut certainly in people older than my wife,
p196
aVthis appears to be a more marked effect.
p197
aVAnd the other thing I should mention
p198
aVwas there was no change in vitamin D.
p199
aVThis is separate from vitamin D.
p200
aVSo vitamin D is good for you \u2014 it stops rickets,
p201
aVit prevents calcium metabolism, important stuff.
p202
aVBut this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow, one of the problems with looking at blood pressure
p205
aVis your body does everything it can
p206
aVto keep your blood pressure at the same place.
p207
aVIf your leg is chopped off and you lose blood,
p208
aVyour body will clamp down, increase the heart rate,
p209
aVdo everything it can to keep your blood pressure up.
p210
aVThat is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo what we've next done
p213
aVis we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation.
p214
aVSo we've measured \u2014 this is again,
p215
aVnotice no tail and hairless, this is a medical student.
p216
aVIn the arm, you can measure blood flow in the arm
p217
aVby how much it swells up as some blood flows into it.
p218
aVAnd what we've shown is that doing a sham irradiation \u2014
p219
aVthis is the thick line here \u2014
p220
aVthis is shining UV on the arm so it warms up
p221
aVbut keeping it covered so the rays don't hit the skin.
p222
aVThere is no change in blood flow, in dilatation of the blood vessels.
p223
aVBut the active irradiation,
p224
aVduring the UV and for an hour after it,
p225
aVthere is dilation of the blood vessels.
p226
aVThis is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure,
p227
aVby which you dilate the coronary arteries also,
p228
aVto let the blood be supplied with the heart.
p229
aVSo here, further data that ultraviolet \u2014 that's sunlight \u2014
p230
aVhas benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo we thought we'd just kind of model \u2014
p233
aVDifferent amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year,
p234
aVso you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide \u2014
p235
aVthe nitrates, nitrites, nitrosothiols in the skin \u2014
p236
aVcleave to release NO.
p237
aVDifferent wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that.
p238
aVSo you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that.
p239
aVAnd you can look \u2014 So, if you live on the equator, the sun comes straight overhead,
p240
aVit comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere.
p241
aVIn winter or summer, it's the same amount of light.
p242
aVIf you live up here, in summer
p243
aVthe sun is coming fairly directly down,
p244
aVbut in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere,
p245
aVand much of the ultraviolet is weeded out,
p246
aVand the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth
p247
aVare different from summer to winter.
p248
aVSo what you can do is you can multiply those data
p249
aVby the NO that's released
p250
aVand you can calculate how much nitric oxide
p251
aVwould be released from the skin into the circulation.
p252
aa(lp253
VNow, if you're on the equator here \u2014
p254
aVthat's these two lines here, the red line and the purple line \u2014
p255
aVthe amount of nitric oxide that's released is the area under the curve,
p256
aVit's the area in this space here.
p257
aVSo if you're on the equator, December or June,
p258
aVyou've got masses of NO being released from the skin.
p259
aVSo Ventura is in southern California.
p260
aVIn summer, you might as well be at the equator.
p261
aVIt's great. Lots of NO is released.
p262
aVVentura mid-winter, well, there's still a decent amount.
p263
aVEdinburgh in summer, the area beneath the curve is pretty good,
p264
aVbut Edinburgh in winter, the amount of NO that can be released
p265
aVis next to nothing, tiny amounts.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo what do we think?
p268
aVWe're still working at this story,
p269
aVwe're still developing it, we're still expanding it.
p270
aVWe think it's very important.
p271
aVWe think it probably accounts for a lot of the north-south health divide within Britain,
p272
aVIt's of relevance to us.
p273
aVWe think that the skin \u2014
p274
aVwell, we know that the skin has got very large stores
p275
aVof nitric oxide as these various other forms.
p276
aVWe suspect a lot of these come from diet,
p277
aVgreen leafy vegetables, beetroot, lettuce
p278
aVhas a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin.
p279
aVWe think they're then stored in the skin,
p280
aVand we think the sunlight releases this
p281
aVwhere it has generally beneficial effects.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd this is ongoing work, but dermatologists \u2014
p284
aVI mean, I'm a dermatologist.
p285
aVMy day job is saying to people, "You've got skin cancer,
p286
aVit's caused by sunlight, don't go in the sun."
p287
aVI actually think a far more important message
p288
aVis that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight.
p289
aVYes, sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer,
p290
aVbut deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher
p291
aVthan deaths from skin cancer.
p292
aVAnd I think that we need to be more aware of,
p293
aVand we need to find the risk-benefit ratio.
p294
aVHow much sunlight is safe,
p295
aVand how can we finesse this best for our general health?
p296
aa(lp297
VSo, thank you very much indeed.
p298

studying medicine in Australia when something suddenly struck him as odd: Why are the Scots so sick? Australians suffer from heart disease at one-third the rate that Britons do, with lower death rates from heart attacks and heart failure, and fewer strokes overall. When Weller looked into it, this wasn&#39;t unique to Australia and England: In fact, there are wide gaps in mortality even within the UK, a gradient which maps roughly ... geographically? A five-degree change in latitude -- between London and Edinburg, for example -- shows a nearly 20 percent higher rate of mortality. Weller and his team have been working ever since to crack this mysterious gap, and most recently their research shows it may be related to exposure to sunlight. Nitric oxide (NO), a chemical transmitter produced by the skin and stored in great reserves, is released by exposure to UV rays, and this in turn is very important to cardiovascular health.</p><p>Weller is a senior lecturer in Dermatology at the University of Edinburgh.

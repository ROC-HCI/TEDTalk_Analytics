VI'm a neuroscientist, a professor at the University of California.
p5
aVAnd over the past 35 years,
p6
aVI've studied behavior
p7
aVon the basis of everything from genes
p8
aVthrough neurotransmitters, dopamine, things like that,
p9
aVall the way through circuit analysis.
p10
aVSo that's what I normally do.
p11
aVBut then, for some reason,
p12
aVI got into something else, just recently.
p13
aVAnd it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me
p14
aVto analyze a bunch of brains
p15
aVof psychopathic killers.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd so this would be the typical talk I would give.
p18
aVAnd the question is, "How do you end up with a psychopathic killer?"
p19
aVWhat I mean by psychopathic killer
p20
aVare these people, these types of people.
p21
aVAnd so some of the brains that I've studied
p22
aVare people you know about.
p23
aVWhen I get the brains I don't know what I'm looking at.
p24
aVIt's blind experiments. They also gave me normal people and everything.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo I've looked at about 70 of these.
p27
aVAnd what came up was a number of pieces of data.
p28
aVSo we look at these sorts of things theoretically,
p29
aVon the basis of genetics,
p30
aVand brain damage, and interaction with environment,
p31
aVand exactly how that machine works.
p32
aVSo we're interested in exactly where in the brain,
p33
aVand what's the most important part of the brain.
p34
aVSo we've been looking at this:
p35
aVthe interaction of genes,
p36
aVwhat's called epigenetic effects,
p37
aVbrain damage, and environment,
p38
aVand how these are tied together.
p39
aVAnd how you end up with a psychopath, and a killer,
p40
aVdepends on exactly when the damage occurs.
p41
aVIt's really a very precisely timed thing.
p42
aVYou get different kinds of psychopaths.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo we're going along with this. And here's, just to give you the pattern.
p45
aVThe pattern is that those people, every one of them I looked at,
p46
aVwho was a murderer, and was a serial killer,
p47
aVhad damage to their orbital cortex,
p48
aVwhich is right above the eyes, the orbits,
p49
aVand also the interior part of the temporal lobe.
p50
aVSo there is the pattern that every one of them had,
p51
aVbut they all were a little different too.
p52
aVThey had other sorts of brain damage.
p53
aVA key thing is that
p54
aVthe major violence genes,
p55
aVit's called the MAO-A gene.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population.
p58
aVSome of you have this. And it's sex-linked.
p59
aVIt's on the X chromosome. And so in this way
p60
aVyou can only get it from your mother.
p61
aVAnd in fact this is probably why mostly men, boys,
p62
aVare psychopathic killers,
p63
aVor are very aggressive.
p64
aVBecause a daughter can get one X from the father,
p65
aVone X from the mother, it's kind of diluted out.
p66
aVBut for a son, he can only get
p67
aVthe X chromosome from his mother.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo this is how it's passed from mother to son.
p70
aVAnd it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development,
p71
aVwhich is kind of interesting because serotonin
p72
aVis supposed to make you calm and relaxed.
p73
aVBut if you have this gene, in utero
p74
aVyour brain is bathed in this,
p75
aVso your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin,
p76
aVso it doesn't work later on in life.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd I'd given this one talk in Israel,
p79
aVjust this past year.
p80
aVAnd it does have some consequences.
p81
aVTheoretically what this means
p82
aVis that in order to express this gene,
p83
aVin a violent way,
p84
aVvery early on, before puberty,
p85
aVyou have to be involved in something that is really traumatic \u2014
p86
aVnot a little stress, not being spanked or something,
p87
aVbut really seeing violence,
p88
aVor being involved in it, in 3D.
p89
aVRight? That's how the mirror neuron system works.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd so, if you have that gene,
p92
aVand you see a lot of violence
p93
aVin a certain situation,
p94
aVthis is the recipe for disaster, absolute disaster.
p95
aVAnd what I think might happen in these areas of the world,
p96
aVwhere we have constant violence,
p97
aVyou end up having generations of kids
p98
aVthat are seeing all this violence.
p99
aVAnd if I was a young girl, somewhere in a violent area,
p100
aVyou know, a 14 year old, and I want to find a mate,
p101
aVI'd find some tough guy, right, to protect me.
p102
aVWell what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes.
p103
aVAnd now the boys and the girls get them.
p104
aVSo I think after several generations,
p105
aVand here is the idea, we really have a tinderbox.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo that was the idea.
p108
aVBut then my mother said to me, "I hear you've been going around talking
p109
aVabout psychopathic killers.
p110
aVAnd you're talking as if you come from a normal family."
p111
aVI said, "What the hell are you talking about?"
p112
aVShe then told me about our own family tree.
p113
aVNow she blamed this on my father's side, of course.
p114
aVThis was one of these cases, because she has no violence in her background,
p115
aVbut my father did.
p116
aa(lp117
VWell she said, "There is good news and bad news.
p118
aVOne of your cousins is Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell university.
p119
aVBut the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow I said, "Okay, so what? We have Lizzie."
p122
aa(lp123
VShe goes, "No it gets worse, read this book."
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd here is this "Killed Strangely," and it's this historical book.
p126
aVAnd the first murder
p127
aVof a mother by a son
p128
aVwas my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
p129
aVOkay, so that's the first case of matricide.
p130
aVAnd that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials,
p131
aVand how people thought back then.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut it doesn't stop there.
p134
aVThere were seven more men, on my father's side,
p135
aVstarting then, Cornells, that were all murderers.
p136
aVOkay, now this gives one a little pause.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aVBecause my father himself,
p139
aVand my three uncles, in World War II,
p140
aVwere all conscientious objectors, all pussycats.
p141
aVBut every once in a while, like Lizzie Borden, like three times a century,
p142
aVand we're kind of due.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VSo the moral of the story is:
p146
aVpeople in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
p147
aVBut more likely is this.
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aVAnd we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it.
p150
aVAnd they all seemed to be OK.
p151
aVBut our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here.
p152
aVSo what we've done is I've started to do PET scans
p153
aVof everybody in the family.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVWe started to do PET scans, EEGs and genetic analysis
p156
aVto see where the bad news is.
p157
aVNow the only person \u2014 it turns out
p158
aVone son and one daughter, siblings,
p159
aVdidn't get along and their patterns are exactly the same.
p160
aVThey have the same brain, and the same EEG.
p161
aVAnd now they are close as can be.
p162
aVBut there's gonna be bad news somewhere.
p163
aVAnd we don't know where it's going to pop up.
p164
aVSo that's my talk.
p165
aV(Laughter)

He lectures and writes on creativity, consciousness and culture, and has made key contributions to our understanding of adult stems and stroke, schizophrenia, Parkinson&#39;s disease and Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p><p>Only lately has Fallon turned his research toward the subject of psychopaths -- particularly those who kill.

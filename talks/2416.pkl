VIt was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.
p5
aVI was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor.
p6
aVI really, really loved my job,
p7
aVbut I was having one of those days
p8
aVwhere I was feeling just a little bit discouraged.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.
p11
aVChris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years,
p12
aVso he had deep institutional knowledge and insights.
p13
aa(lp14
VI explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck.
p15
aVI had been investigating a number of issues
p16
aVat the intersection of science and civil liberties \u2014 super interesting.
p17
aVBut I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way,
p18
aVin a way that could really make a difference.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo Chris cut right to the chase, and he says,
p21
aV"Well, of all the issues you've been looking at, what are the top five?"
p22
aa(lp23
V"Well, there's genetic discrimination,
p24
aVand reproductive technologies,
p25
aVand biobanking, and ...
p26
aVoh, there's this really cool issue,
p27
aVfunctional MRI and using it for lie detection, and ...
p28
aVoh, and of course, there's gene patents."
p29
aa(lp30
V"Gene patents?"
p31
aa(lp32
V"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."
p33
aa(lp34
V"No!
p35
aVYou're telling me that the US government
p36
aVhas been issuing patents on part of the human body?
p37
aVThat can't be right."
p38
aa(lp39
VI went back to my office and sent Chris three articles.
p40
aVAnd 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office.
p41
aV"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VNow Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,
p46
aVbut he knew almost nothing about patent law
p47
aVand certainly nothing about genetics.
p48
aVI knew something about genetics, but I wasn't even a lawyer,
p49
aVlet alone a patent lawyer.
p50
aVSo clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit.
p51
aa(lp52
VFirst, we needed to understand exactly what was patented
p53
aVwhen someone patented a gene.
p54
aVGene patents typically contain dozens of claims,
p55
aVbut the most controversial of these are to so-called "isolated DNA" \u2014
p56
aVnamely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell.
p57
aa(lp58
VGene patent proponents say,
p59
aV"See? We didn't patent the gene in your body,
p60
aVwe patented an isolated gene."
p61
aVAnd that's true,
p62
aVbut the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated.
p63
aVAnd the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated,
p64
aVbut on every possible version of that gene.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo what does that mean?
p67
aa(lp68
VThat means that you can't give your gene to your doctor
p69
aVand ask him or her to look at it,
p70
aVsay, to see if it has any mutations,
p71
aVwithout permission of the patent holder.
p72
aVIt also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone
p73
aVfrom using that gene in research or clinical testing.
p74
aVAllowing patent holders,
p75
aVoften private companies,
p76
aVto lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients.
p77
aa(lp78
VConsider Abigail,
p79
aVa 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,
p80
aVa serious heart condition that, if left untreated,
p81
aVcan result in sudden death.
p82
aVThe company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition
p83
aVdeveloped a test to diagnose the syndrome.
p84
aVBut then they went bankrupt and they never offered it.
p85
aVSo another lab tried to offer the test,
p86
aVbut the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab
p87
aVfor patent infringement.
p88
aVSo as a result,
p89
aVfor 2 years, no test was available.
p90
aVDuring that time,
p91
aVAbigail died of undiagnosed long QT.
p92
aa(lp93
VGene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients.
p94
aVBut was there a way we could challenge them?
p95
aa(lp96
VTurns out that the Supreme Court
p97
aVhas made clear through a long line of cases,
p98
aVthat certain things are not patent eligible.
p99
aVYou can't patent products of nature \u2014
p100
aVthe air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table.
p101
aVAnd you can't patent laws of nature \u2014
p102
aVthe law of gravity, E = mc2.
p103
aVThese things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all
p104
aVand reserved exclusively to none.
p105
aa(lp106
VIt seemed to us that DNA,
p107
aVthe most fundamental structure of life,
p108
aVthat codes for the production of all of our proteins,
p109
aVis both a product of nature and a law of nature,
p110
aVregardless of whether it's in our bodies
p111
aVor sitting in the bottom of a test tube.
p112
aa(lp113
VAs we delved into this issue,
p114
aVwe traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts \u2014
p115
aVscientists, medical professionals, lawyers, patent lawyers.
p116
aVMost of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy,
p117
aVand, at least in theory, as a matter of law.
p118
aVAll of them thought
p119
aVour chances of winning a gene-patent challenge
p120
aVwere about zero.
p121
aa(lp122
VWhy is that?
p123
aVWell, the patent office had been issuing these patents
p124
aVfor more than 20 years.
p125
aVThere were literally thousands of patents on human genes.
p126
aVThe patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo,
p127
aVthe biotech industry had grown up around this practice,
p128
aVand legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced
p129
aVyear after year in Congress,
p130
aVand had gone absolutely nowhere.
p131
aVSo the bottom line:
p132
aVcourts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge,
p135
aVand hearing, "Being right just isn't enough,"
p136
aVseemed all the more reason to take on this fight.
p137
aVSo we set out to build our case.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B
p140
aVover some really narrow, obscure technical issue.
p141
aVWe weren't really interested in that kind of case,
p142
aVand we thought this case was much bigger than that.
p143
aVThis was about scientific freedom, medical progress,
p144
aVthe rights of patients.
p145
aVSo we decided we were going to develop a case
p146
aVthat was not like your typical patent case \u2014
p147
aVmore like a civil rights case.
p148
aa(lp149
VWe set out to identify a gene-patent holder
p150
aVthat was vigorously enforcing its patents
p151
aVand then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts
p152
aVthat could tell the court
p153
aVabout all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation.
p154
aa(lp155
VWe found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics,
p156
aVa company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah.
p157
aVMyriad held patents on two genes,
p158
aVthe BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.
p159
aVWomen with certain mutations along these genes
p160
aVare considered to be at a significantly increased risk
p161
aVof developing breast and ovarian cancer.
p162
aVMyriad had used its patents to maintain
p163
aVa complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States.
p164
aVIt had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop.
p165
aVIt charged a lot of money for its test \u2014
p166
aVover 3,000 dollars.
p167
aVIt had stopped sharing its clinical data
p168
aVwith the international scientific community.
p169
aVAnd perhaps worst of all,
p170
aVfor a period of several years,
p171
aVMyriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations
p172
aVthat had been identified by a team of researchers in France.
p173
aa(lp174
VIt has been estimated that during that period,
p175
aVfor several years,
p176
aVas many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing
p177
aVreceived the wrong answer \u2014
p178
aVa negative test result that should have been positive.
p179
aa(lp180
VThis is Kathleen Maxian.
p181
aVKathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40
p182
aVand she was tested by Myriad.
p183
aVThe test was negative.
p184
aVThe family was relieved.
p185
aVThat meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family,
p186
aVand that other members of her family didn't need to be tested.
p187
aVBut two years later,
p188
aVKathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.
p189
aVIt turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent
p190
aVwho received a false-negative test result.
p191
aVHad Eileen received the proper result,
p192
aVKathleen would have then been tested,
p193
aVand her ovarian cancer could have been prevented.
p194
aa(lp195
VOnce we settled on Myriad,
p196
aVwe then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts
p197
aVthat could illuminate these problems.
p198
aVWe ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs:
p199
aVgenetic counselors,
p200
aVgeneticists who had received cease and desist letters,
p201
aVadvocacy organizations,
p202
aVfour major scientific organizations that collectively represented
p203
aVmore than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals,
p204
aVand individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test,
p205
aVor who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not,
p206
aVas a result of the patents.
p207
aa(lp208
VOne of the major challenges we had in preparing the case
p209
aVwas figuring out how best to communicate the science.
p210
aVSo in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention,
p211
aVand that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature,
p212
aVwe had to explain a couple of basic concepts, like:
p213
aVWhat's a gene? What's DNA?
p214
aVHow is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention?
p215
aa(lp216
VWe spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts,
p217
aVtrying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts
p218
aVsimply yet accurately.
p219
aVAnd we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors,
p220
aVlike gold.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo isolating DNA \u2014
p223
aVit's like extracting gold from a mountain
p224
aVor taking it out of a stream bed.
p225
aVYou might be able to patent the process for mining the gold,
p226
aVbut you can't patent the gold itself.
p227
aVIt might've taken a lot of hard work and effort
p228
aVto dig the gold out of the mountain;
p229
aVyou still can't patent it, it's still gold.
p230
aVAnd the gold, once it's extracted,
p231
aVcan clearly be used for all sorts of things
p232
aVthat it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain;
p233
aVyou can make jewelry out of it for example \u2014
p234
aVstill can't patent the gold, it's still gold.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo now it's 2009, and we're ready to file our case.
p237
aVWe filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York,
p238
aVand the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet.
p239
aVIn March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion \u2014
p240
aV152 pages \u2014
p241
aVand a complete victory for our side.
p242
aa(lp243
VIn reading the opinion,
p244
aVwe could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case.
p245
aVI mean, our brief \u2014 it was pretty good,
p246
aVbut not this good.
p247
aVHow did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue
p248
aVin such a short time?
p249
aVWe just could not comprehend how this had happened.
p250
aVSo it turned out,
p251
aVJudge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time,
p252
aVwas not just a lawyer \u2014
p253
aVhe was a scientist.
p254
aVHe was not just a scientist \u2014
p255
aVhe had a PhD in molecular biology.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VWhat an incredible stroke of luck!
p260
aa(lp261
VMyriad then appealed
p262
aVto the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
p263
aVAnd here things got really interesting.
p264
aa(lp265
VFirst, in a pivotal moment of this case,
p266
aVthe US government switched sides.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side.
p269
aVBut now in direct opposition to its own patent office,
p270
aVthe US government files a brief that states that is has
p271
aVreconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion,
p272
aVand has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible.
p273
aVThis was a really big deal,
p274
aVtotally unexpected.
p275
aa(lp276
VThe Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
p277
aVhears all patent cases,
p278
aVand it has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent.
p279
aVSo even with this remarkable development,
p280
aVwe expected to lose.
p281
aVAnd we did.
p282
aVSort of.
p283
aVEnds up split decision, 2 to 1.
p284
aVBut the two judges who ruled against us,
p285
aVdid so for completely different reasons.
p286
aVThe first one, Judge Lourie,
p287
aVmade up his own novel, biological theory \u2014
p288
aVtotally wrong.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VHe decided Myriad had created a new chemical \u2014
p293
aVmade absolutely no sense.
p294
aVMyriad didn't even argue this, so it came out of the blue.
p295
aVThe other, Judge Moore,
p296
aVsaid she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature.
p297
aVBut she's like, "I don't want to shake up the biotech industry."
p298
aVThe third, Judge Bryson,
p299
aVagreed with us.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo now we sought review by the Supreme Court.
p302
aVAnd when you petition the Supreme Court,
p303
aVyou have to present a question that you want the Court to answer.
p304
aVUsually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph,
p305
aVlike a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses,
p306
aV"wherein this" and "therefore that."
p307
aVWe submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever.
p308
aVFour words:
p309
aVAre human genes patentable?
p310
aa(lp311
VNow when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words,
p312
aVI said, "Well, I don't know.
p313
aVI think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'"
p314
aa(lp315
V"Nope.
p316
aVI want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had
p317
aVwhen you brought this issue to me seven years ago."
p318
aa(lp319
VWell, I certainly couldn't argue with that.
p320
aa(lp321
VThe Supreme Court only hears about one percent
p322
aVof the cases that it receives,
p323
aVand it agreed to hear ours.
p324
aVThe day of the oral argument arrives, and it was really, really exciting \u2014
p325
aVlong line of people outside,
p326
aVpeople had been standing in line since 2:30 in the morning
p327
aVto try to get into the courthouse.
p328
aVTwo breast cancer organizations,
p329
aVBreast Cancer Action and FORCE,
p330
aVhad organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps.
p331
aa(lp332
VChris and I sat quietly in the hallway,
p333
aVmoments before he was to walk in and argue
p334
aVthe most important case of his career.
p335
aVI was clearly more nervous than he was.
p336
aVBut any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom
p337
aVand looked around at a sea of friendly faces:
p338
aVour individual women clients
p339
aVwho had shared their deeply personal stories,
p340
aVthe geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers
p341
aVto dedicate themselves to this fight
p342
aVand representatives from a diverse array
p343
aVof medical, patient advocacy,
p344
aVenvironmental and religious organizations,
p345
aVwho had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case.
p346
aa(lp347
VAlso in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project,
p348
aVincluding the co-discoverer of DNA himself,
p349
aVJames Watson,
p350
aVwho had submitted a brief to the court,
p351
aVwhere he referred to gene patenting as "lunacy."
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VThe diversity of the communities represented in this room
p356
aVand the contributions each had made to make this day a reality
p357
aVspoke volumes to what was at stake.
p358
aa(lp359
VThe argument itself was riveting.
p360
aVChris argued brilliantly.
p361
aVBut for me,
p362
aVthe most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple
p363
aVwith isolated DNA,
p364
aVthrough a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges,
p365
aVvery much the same way as our legal team had done
p366
aVfor the past seven years.
p367
aVJustice Kagan likened isolating DNA
p368
aVto extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon.
p369
aVJustice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree.
p370
aVAnd in one of my absolutely favorite moments,
p371
aVJustice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be "just nature sitting there."
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VWe felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day,
p376
aVbut I could never have anticipated the outcome:
p377
aVnine to zero.
p378
aa(lp379
V"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature,
p380
aVand not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated.
p381
aVAnd furthermore,
p382
aVMyriad did not create anything."
p383
aa(lp384
VWithin 24 hours of the decision,
p385
aVfive labs had announced
p386
aVthat they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes.
p387
aVSome of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's.
p388
aVSome promised to provide a more comprehensive test
p389
aVthan the one Myriad was offering.
p390
aa(lp391
VBut of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad.
p392
aVIt ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes
p393
aVin the United States.
p394
aVIt clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation.
p395
aVAnd it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen
p396
aVhave access to the tests that they need.
p397
aa(lp398
VA few weeks after the court issued its decision,
p399
aVI received a small package in the mail.
p400
aVIt was from Bob Cook-Deegan,
p401
aVa professor at Duke University
p402
aVand one the very first people Chris and I went to visit
p403
aVwhen we started to consider whether to bring this case.
p404
aVI opened it up to find a small stuffed animal.
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
VWe took a big risk in taking this case.
p409
aVPart of what gave us the courage to take that risk
p410
aVwas knowing that we were doing the right thing.
p411
aVThe process took nearly eight years from the start to finish,
p412
aVwith many twists and turns along the way.
p413
aVA little luck certainly helped,
p414
aVbut it was the communities that we bridged,
p415
aVthe alliances that we created,
p416
aVthat made pigs fly.
p417
aa(lp418
VThank you.

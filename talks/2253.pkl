VI know what you're thinking:
p5
aV"Why does that guy get to sit down?"
p6
aVThat's because this is radio.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Music)
p9
aa(lp10
VI tell radio stories about design,
p11
aVand I report on all kinds of stories:
p12
aVbuildings and toothbrushes, mascots and wayfinding and fonts.
p13
aVMy mission is to get people to engage with the design that they care about
p14
aVso they begin to pay attention to all forms of design.
p15
aVWhen you decode the world with design intent in mind,
p16
aVthe world becomes kind of magical.
p17
aVInstead of seeing the broken things,
p18
aVyou see all the little bits of genius
p19
aVthat anonymous designers have sweated over to make our lives better.
p20
aVAnd that's essentially the definition of design:
p21
aVmaking life better and providing joy.
p22
aVAnd few things give me greater joy
p23
aVthan a well-designed flag.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VYeah!
p28
aa(lp29
V(Applause)
p30
aa(lp31
VHappy 50th anniversary on your flag, Canada.
p32
aVIt is beautiful, gold standard.
p33
aVLove it.
p34
aa(lp35
VI'm kind of obsessed with flags.
p36
aVSometimes I bring up the topic of flags,
p37
aVand people are like, "I don't care about flags,"
p38
aVand then we start talking about flags, and trust me,
p39
aV100 percent of people care about flags.
p40
aVThere's just something about them that works on our emotions.
p41
aa(lp42
VMy family wrapped my Christmas presents as flags this year,
p43
aVincluding the blue gift bag that's dressed up as the flag of Scotland.
p44
aVI put this picture online, and sure enough,
p45
aVwithin the first few minutes, someone left a comment that said,
p46
aV"You can take that Scottish Saltire and shove it up your ass."
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VSee, people are passionate about flags, you know?
p51
aVThat's the way it is.
p52
aa(lp53
VWhat I love about flags
p54
aVis that once you understand the design of flags,
p55
aVwhat makes a good flag, what makes a bad flag,
p56
aVyou can understand the design of almost anything.
p57
aVSo what I'm going to do here is,
p58
aVI cracked open an episode of my radio show,
p59
aV"99% Invisible," and I'm going to reconstruct it here on stage,
p60
aVso when I press a button over here \u2014
p61
aVVoice: S for Sound \u2014
p62
aVRoman Mars: It's going to make a sound,
p63
aVand so whenever you hear a sound or a voice or a piece of music,
p64
aVit's because I pressed a button.
p65
aa(lp66
VVoice: Sound.
p67
aa(lp68
VRM: All right, got it? Here we go.
p69
aVThree, two.
p70
aa(lp71
VThis is 99% Invisible. I'm Roman Mars.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Music)
p74
aa(lp75
VNarrator: The five basic principles of flag design.
p76
aa(lp77
VRoman Mars: According to the North American Vexillological Association.
p78
aVVexillological.
p79
aa(lp80
VTed Kaye: Vexillology is the study of flags.
p81
aa(lp82
VRM: It's that extra "lol" that makes it sound weird.
p83
aa(lp84
VNarrator: Number one, keep it simple.
p85
aVThe flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.
p86
aa(lp87
VRM: Before I moved to Chicago in 2005,
p88
aVI didn't even know cities had their own flags.
p89
aa(lp90
VTK: Most larger cities do have flags.
p91
aa(lp92
VRM: Well, I didn't know that, that's Ted Kaye, by the way.
p93
aa(lp94
VTK: Hello.
p95
aVRM: He's a flag expert, he's a totally awesome guy.
p96
aa(lp97
VTK: I'm Ted Kaye, I have edited a scholarly journal on flag studies,
p98
aVand I am currently involved with the Portland Flag Association
p99
aVand the North American Vexillological Association.
p100
aa(lp101
VRM: Ted literally wrote the book on flag design.
p102
aa(lp103
VNarrator: "Good Flag, Bad Flag."
p104
aa(lp105
VRM: It's more of a pamphlet, really, it's about 16 pages.
p106
aa(lp107
VTK: Yes, it's called "Good Flag, Bad Flag: How to Design a Great Flag."
p108
aa(lp109
VRM: And that first city flag I discovered in Chicago
p110
aVis a beaut:
p111
aVwhite field, two horizontal blue stripes,
p112
aVand four six-pointed red stars down the middle.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Sound)
p115
aa(lp116
VNarrator: Number two, use meaningful symbolism.
p117
aa(lp118
VTK: The blue stripes represent the water, the river and the lake.
p119
aa(lp120
VNarrator: The flag's images, colors or pattern
p121
aVshould relate to what it symbolizes.
p122
aa(lp123
VTK: The red stars represent significant events in Chicago's history.
p124
aa(lp125
VRM: Namely, the founding of Fort Dearborn on the future site of Chicago,
p126
aVthe Great Chicago Fire,
p127
aVthe World Columbian Exposition, which everyone remembers
p128
aVbecause of the White City,
p129
aVand the Century of Progress Exposition, which no one remembers at all.
p130
aa(lp131
VNarrator: Number three, use two to three basic colors.
p132
aa(lp133
VTK: The basic rule for colors is to use two to three colors
p134
aVfrom the standard color set: red, white, blue, green, yellow and black.
p135
aa(lp136
VRM: The design of the Chicago flag has complete buy-in
p137
aVwith an entire cross-section of the city.
p138
aVIt is everywhere;
p139
aVevery municipal building flies the flag.
p140
aa(lp141
VWhet Moser: There's probably at least one store on every block
p142
aVnear where I work that sells some sort of Chicago flag paraphernalia.
p143
aa(lp144
VRM: That's Whet Moser from Chicago magazine.
p145
aa(lp146
VWM: Today, just for example, I went to get a haircut,
p147
aVand when I sat down in the barber's chair,
p148
aVthere was a Chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in,
p149
aVand then in the mirror, there was a Chicago flag on the wall behind me.
p150
aVWhen I left, a guy passed me who had a Chicago flag badge on his backpack.
p151
aa(lp152
VRM: It's adaptable and remixable.
p153
aVThe six-pointed stars in particular show up in all kinds of places.
p154
aa(lp155
VWM: The coffee I bought the other day had a Chicago star on it.
p156
aa(lp157
VRM: It's a distinct symbol of Chicago pride.
p158
aa(lp159
VTK: When a police officer or a firefighter dies in Chicago,
p160
aVoften it's not the flag of the United States on his casket.
p161
aVIt can be the flag of the city of Chicago.
p162
aVThat's how deeply the flag has gotten into the civic imagery of Chicago.
p163
aa(lp164
VRM: And it isn't just that people love Chicago and therefore love the flag.
p165
aVI also think that people love Chicago more because the flag is so cool.
p166
aa(lp167
VTK: A positive feedback loop there between great symbolism and civic pride.
p168
aa(lp169
VRM: OK, so when I moved back to San Francisco in 2008,
p170
aVI researched its flag,
p171
aVbecause I had never seen it in the previous eight years I lived there.
p172
aVAnd I found it, I am sorry to say,
p173
aVsadly lacking.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VI know.
p178
aVIt hurts me, too.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VTK: Well, let me start from the top.
p183
aa(lp184
VNarrator: Number one, keep it simple.
p185
aa(lp186
VTK: Keeping it simple.
p187
aa(lp188
VNarrator: The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.
p189
aa(lp190
VTK: It's a relatively complex flag.
p191
aa(lp192
VRM: OK, here we go, OK.
p193
aVThe main component of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix
p194
aVrepresenting the city rising from the ashes
p195
aVafter the devastating fires of the 1850s.
p196
aa(lp197
VTK: A powerful symbol for San Francisco.
p198
aa(lp199
VRM: I still don't really dig the phoenix.
p200
aVDesign-wise, it manages to both be too crude
p201
aVand have too many details at the same time,
p202
aVwhich if you were trying for that,
p203
aVyou wouldn't be able to do it,
p204
aVand it just looks bad at a distance,
p205
aVbut having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column.
p206
aVBehind the phoenix, the background is mostly white,
p207
aVand then it has a substantial gold border around it.
p208
aa(lp209
VTK: Which is a very attractive design element.
p210
aa(lp211
VRM: I think it's OK, but \u2014
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aVhere come the big no-nos of flag design.
p215
aa(lp216
VNarrator: Number four, no lettering or seals.
p217
aVNever use writing of any kind.
p218
aa(lp219
VRM: Underneath the phoenix, there's a motto on a ribbon
p220
aVthat translates to "Gold in peace, iron in war,"
p221
aVplus \u2014 and this is the big problem \u2014
p222
aVit says San Francisco across the bottom.
p223
aa(lp224
VTK: If you need to write the name of what you're representing on your flag,
p225
aVyour symbolism has failed.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
V(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VRM: The United States flag doesn't say "USA" across the front.
p232
aVIn fact, country flags, they tend to behave.
p233
aVLike, hats off to South Africa and Turkey and Israel
p234
aVand Somalia and Japan and Gambia.
p235
aVThere's a bunch of really great country flags,
p236
aVbut they obey good design principles because the stakes are high.
p237
aVThey're on the international stage.
p238
aVBut city, state and regional flags are another story.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VThere is a scourge of bad flags \u2014
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
Vand they must be stopped.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
V(Applause)
p251
aa(lp252
VThat is the truth and that is the dare.
p253
aVThe first step is to recognize that we have a problem.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VA lot of people tend to think that good design
p258
aVis just a matter of taste,
p259
aVand quite honestly, sometimes it is, actually,
p260
aVbut sometimes it isn't, all right?
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VHere's the full list of NAVA flag design principles.
p265
aa(lp266
VNarrator: The five basic principles of flag design.
p267
aa(lp268
VNarrator: Number one. TK: Keep it simple.
p269
aa(lp270
VNarrator: Number two. TK: Use meaningful symbolism.
p271
aa(lp272
VNarrator: Number three. TK: Use two to three basic colors.
p273
aa(lp274
VNarrator: Number four. TK: No lettering or seals.
p275
aa(lp276
VNarrator: Never use writing of any kind.
p277
aa(lp278
VTK: Because you can't read that at a distance.
p279
aa(lp280
VNarrator: Number five. TK: And be distinctive.
p281
aa(lp282
VRM: All the best flags tend to stick to these principles.
p283
aVAnd like I said before, most country flags are OK.
p284
aVBut here's the thing:
p285
aVif you showed this list of principles to any designer of almost anything,
p286
aVthey would say these principles \u2014 simplicity, deep meaning,
p287
aVhaving few colors or being thoughtful about colors,
p288
aVuniqueness, don't have writing you can't read \u2014
p289
aVall those principles apply to them, too.
p290
aVBut sadly, good design principles are rarely invoked in US city flags.
p291
aVOur biggest problem seems to be that fourth one.
p292
aVWe just can't stop ourselves from putting our names on our flags,
p293
aVor little municipal seals with tiny writing on them.
p294
aVHere's the thing about municipal seals:
p295
aVThey were designed to be on pieces of paper
p296
aVwhere you can read them,
p297
aVnot on flags 100 feet away flapping in the breeze.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo here's a bunch of flags again.
p300
aVVexillologists call these SOBs:
p301
aVSeals on a bedsheet \u2014
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
Vand if you can't tell what city they go to,
p306
aVyeah, that's exactly the problem,
p307
aVexcept for Anaheim, apparently, they fixed it.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VThese flags are everywhere in the US.
p312
aVThe European equivalent of the municipal seal
p313
aVis the city coat of arms ...
p314
aVand this is where we can learn a lesson for how to do things right.
p315
aVSo this is the city coat of arms of Amsterdam.
p316
aVNow, if this were a United States city,
p317
aVthe flag would probably look like this.
p318
aVYou know, yeah.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VBut instead, the flag of Amsterdam
p323
aVlooks like this.
p324
aVRather than plopping the whole coat of arms
p325
aVon a solid background and writing "Amsterdam" below it,
p326
aVthey just take the key elements of the escutcheon, the shield,
p327
aVand they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
V(Applause)
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd because it's so badass,
p334
aVthose flags and crosses are found throughout Amsterdam,
p335
aVjust like Chicago, they're used.
p336
aa(lp337
VEven though seal-on-a-bedsheet flags are particularly painful
p338
aVand offensive to me,
p339
aVnothing can quite prepare you
p340
aVfor one of the biggest train wrecks in vexillological history.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
VAre you ready?
p345
aVIt's the flag of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VI mean, it's distinctive,
p350
aVI'll give them that.
p351
aa(lp352
VSteve Kodis: It was adopted in 1955.
p353
aa(lp354
VRM: The city ran a contest
p355
aVand gathered a bunch of submissions with all kinds of designs.
p356
aa(lp357
VSK: And an alderman by the name of Fred Steffan
p358
aVcobbled together parts of the submissions to make what is now the Milwaukee flag.
p359
aa(lp360
VRM: It's a kitchen sink flag.
p361
aVThere's a gigantic gear representing industry,
p362
aVthere's a ship recognizing the port,
p363
aVa giant stalk of wheat
p364
aVpaying homage to the brewing industry.
p365
aVIt's a hot mess,
p366
aVand Steve Kodis, a graphic designer from Milwaukee, wants to change it.
p367
aa(lp368
VSK: It's really awful.
p369
aVIt's a misstep on the city's behalf,
p370
aVto say the least.
p371
aa(lp372
VRM: But what puts the Milwaukee flag over the top,
p373
aValmost to the point of self-parody,
p374
aVis on it is a picture of the Civil War battle flag of the Milwaukee regiment.
p375
aa(lp376
VSK: So that's the final element in it
p377
aVthat just makes it that much more ridiculous,
p378
aVthat there is a flag design within the Milwaukee flag.
p379
aa(lp380
VRM: On the flag. Yeah. Yeah.
p381
aa(lp382
V(Laughter)
p383
aa(lp384
VYeah.
p385
aa(lp386
V(Music)
p387
aa(lp388
VNow, Milwaukee is a fantastic city.
p389
aVI've been there, I love it.
p390
aVThe most depressing part of this flag, though,
p391
aVis that there have been two major redesign contests.
p392
aVThe last one was held in 2001.
p393
aV105 entries were received.
p394
aa(lp395
VTK: But in the end, the members of the Milwaukee Arts Board
p396
aVdecided that none of the new entries were worthy of flying over the city.
p397
aa(lp398
VRM: They couldn't agree to change that thing!
p399
aa(lp400
V(Laughter)
p401
aa(lp402
VThat's discouraging enough to make you think
p403
aVthat good design and democracy just simply do not go together.
p404
aa(lp405
V(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VBut Steve Kotas is going to try one more time
p408
aVto redesign the Milwaukee flag.
p409
aa(lp410
VSK: I believe Milwaukee is a great city.
p411
aVEvery great city deserves a great flag.
p412
aa(lp413
VRM: Steve isn't ready to reveal his design yet.
p414
aVOne of the things about proposing one of these things
p415
aVis you have to get people on board,
p416
aVand then you reveal your design.
p417
aVBut here's the trick:
p418
aVIf you want to design a great flag,
p419
aVa kick-ass flag like Chicago's or DC's, which also has a great flag,
p420
aVstart by drawing a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle
p421
aVon a piece of paper.
p422
aVYour design has to fit within that tiny rectangle.
p423
aVHere's why.
p424
aa(lp425
VTK: A three-by-five-foot flag on a pole 100 feet away
p426
aVlooks about the same size as a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle
p427
aVseen about 15 inches from your eye.
p428
aVYou'd be surprised by how compelling and simple the design can be
p429
aVwhen you hold yourself to that limitation.
p430
aa(lp431
VRM: Meanwhile, back in San Francisco.
p432
aVIs there anything we can do?
p433
aa(lp434
VTK: I like to say that in every bad flag there's a good flag trying to get out.
p435
aVThe way to make San Francisco's flag a good flag
p436
aVis to take the motto off because you can't read that at a distance.
p437
aVTake the name off,
p438
aVand the border might even be made thicker, so it's more a part of the flag.
p439
aVAnd I would simply take the phoenix
p440
aVand make it a great big element in the middle of the flag.
p441
aa(lp442
VRM: But the current phoenix, that's got to go.
p443
aa(lp444
VTK: I would simplify or stylize the phoenix.
p445
aVDepict a big, wide-winged bird
p446
aVcoming out of flames.
p447
aVEmphasize those flames.
p448
aa(lp449
VRM: So this San Francisco flag was designed by Frank Chimero
p450
aVbased on Ted Kaye's suggestions.
p451
aVI don't know what he would do if we was completely unfettered
p452
aVand didn't follow those guidelines.
p453
aVFans of my radio show and podcast, heard me complain about bad flags.
p454
aVThey've sent me other suggested designs.
p455
aVThis one's by Neil Mussett.
p456
aVBoth are so much better.
p457
aa(lp458
V(Laughter)
p459
aa(lp460
VAnd I think if they were adopted,
p461
aVI would see them around the city.
p462
aa(lp463
VIn my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful,
p464
aVmany listeners have taken it upon themselves
p465
aVto redesign their flags and look into the feasibility
p466
aVof getting them officially adopted.
p467
aa(lp468
V(Music)
p469
aa(lp470
VIf you see your city flag and like it,
p471
aVfly it,
p472
aVeven if it violates a design rule or two.
p473
aVI don't care.
p474
aVBut if you don't see your city flag,
p475
aVmaybe it doesn't exist, but maybe it does,
p476
aVand it just sucks,
p477
aVand I dare you to join the effort to try to change that.
p478
aa(lp479
VAs we move more and more into cities,
p480
aVthe city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place,
p481
aVbut also, it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself,
p482
aVespecially today, as the populace is becoming more design-aware.
p483
aVAnd I think design awareness is at an all-time high.
p484
aVA well-designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city
p485
aVconsiders all of its design systems:
p486
aVits public transit,
p487
aVits parks, its signage.
p488
aVIt might seem frivolous, but it's not.
p489
aa(lp490
VTK: Often when city leaders say,
p491
aV"We have more important things to do than worry about a city flag,"
p492
aVmy response is,
p493
aV"If you had a great city flag,
p494
aVyou would have a banner for people to rally under
p495
aVto face those more important things."
p496
aa(lp497
V(Music)
p498
aa(lp499
VRM: I've seen firsthand what a good city flag can do
p500
aVin the case of Chicago.
p501
aVThe marriage of good design and civic pride
p502
aVis something that we need in all places.
p503
aVThe best part about municipal flags is that we own them.
p504
aVThey are an open-source,
p505
aVpublicly owned design language of the community.
p506
aVWhen they are done well,
p507
aVthey are remixable, adaptable, and they are powerful.
p508
aVWe could control the branding and graphical imagery
p509
aVof our cities with a good flag,
p510
aVbut instead, by having bad flags we don't use,
p511
aVwe cede that territory to sports teams

aVSports teams can leave and break our hearts.
p514
aVAnd besides, some of us don't really care about sports.
p515
aVAnd tourism campaigns can just be cheesy.
p516
aVBut a great city flag
p517
aVis something that represents a city to its people
p518
aVand its people to the world at large.
p519
aVAnd when that flag is a beautiful thing,
p520
aVthat connection is a beautiful thing.
p521
aa(lp522
VSo maybe all the city flags can be as inspiring as Hong Kong

VWe are here today
p5
aVbecause [the] United Nations
p6
aVhave defined goals
p7
aVfor the progress of countries.
p8
aVThey're called Millennium Development Goals.
p9
aVAnd the reason I really like these goals
p10
aVis that there are eight of them.
p11
aVAnd by specifying eight different goals,
p12
aVthe United Nations has said
p13
aVthat there are so many things needed
p14
aVto change in a country
p15
aVin order to get the good life for people.
p16
aVLook here \u2014 you have to end poverty,
p17
aVeducation, gender,
p18
aVchild and maternal health,
p19
aVcontrol infections, protect the environment
p20
aVand get the good global links between nations
p21
aVin every aspect
p22
aVfrom aid to trade.
p23
aa(lp24
VThere's a second reason I like these development goals,
p25
aVand that is because each and every one is measured.
p26
aVTake child mortality;
p27
aVthe aim here is to reduce child mortality
p28
aVby two-thirds,
p29
aVfrom 1990 to 2015.
p30
aVThat's a four percent reduction per year \u2014
p31
aVand this, with measuring.
p32
aVThat's what makes the difference
p33
aVbetween political talking like this
p34
aVand really going for the important thing,
p35
aVa better life for people.
p36
aVAnd what I'm so happy about with this
p37
aVis that we have already documented
p38
aVthat there are many countries
p39
aVin Asia, in the Middle East,
p40
aVin Latin America and East Europe
p41
aVthat [are] reducing with this rate.
p42
aVAnd even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year,
p43
aVand Turkey with seven percent per year.
p44
aVSo there's good news.
p45
aVBut then I hear people saying, "There is no progress in Africa.
p46
aVAnd there's not even statistics on Africa
p47
aVto know what is happening."
p48
aVI'll prove them wrong on both points.
p49
aa(lp50
VCome with me to the wonderful world of statistics.
p51
aVI bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org,
p52
aVwhere you can take deaths in children
p53
aVbelow five years of age for all countries \u2014
p54
aVit's done by U.N. specialists.
p55
aVAnd I will take Kenya as an example.
p56
aVHere you see the data.
p57
aVDon't panic \u2014 don't panic now, I'll help you through this.
p58
aVIt looks nasty, like in college
p59
aVwhen you didn't like statistics.
p60
aVBut first thing, when you see dots like this,
p61
aVyou have to ask yourself:
p62
aVfrom where do the data come?
p63
aVWhat is the origin of the data?
p64
aVIs it so that in Kenya,
p65
aVthere are doctors and other specialists
p66
aVwho write the death certificate at the death of the child
p67
aVand it's sent to the statistical office?
p68
aVNo \u2014 low-income countries like Kenya
p69
aVstill don't have that level of organization.
p70
aVIt exists, but it's not complete
p71
aVbecause so many deaths occur in the home
p72
aVwith the family,
p73
aVand it's not registered.
p74
aVWhat we rely on is not an incomplete system.
p75
aVWe have interviews, we have surveys.
p76
aVAnd this is highly professional
p77
aVfemale interviewers
p78
aVwho sit down for one hour with a woman
p79
aVand ask her about [her] birth history.
p80
aVHow many children did you have?
p81
aVAre they alive?
p82
aVIf they died, at what age and what year?
p83
aVAnd then this is done in a representative sample
p84
aVof thousands of women in the country
p85
aVand put together in what used to be called
p86
aVa demographic health survey report.
p87
aVBut these surveys are costly,
p88
aVso they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals.
p89
aVBut they have good quality.
p90
aVSo this is a limitation.
p91
aVAnd all these colored lines here are results;
p92
aVeach color is one survey.
p93
aVBut that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you,
p94
aVand I give you one average point for each survey.
p95
aa(lp96
VThis was 1977, 1988,
p97
aV1992, '97
p98
aVand 2002.
p99
aVAnd when the experts in the U.N.
p100
aVhave got these surveys in place in their database,
p101
aVthen they use advanced mathematical formulas
p102
aVto produce a trend line, and the trend line looks like this.
p103
aVSee here \u2014 it's the best fit they can get of this point.
p104
aVBut watch out \u2014
p105
aVthey continue the line
p106
aVbeyond the last point
p107
aVout into nothing.
p108
aVAnd they estimated that in 2008,
p109
aVKenya had per child mortality of 128.
p110
aVAnd I was sad,
p111
aVbecause we could see
p112
aVthis reversal in Kenya
p113
aVwith an increased child mortality in the 90s.
p114
aVIt was so tragic.
p115
aVBut in June, I got a mail in my inbox
p116
aVfrom Demographic Health Surveys,
p117
aVand it showed good news from Kenya.
p118
aVI was so happy.
p119
aVThis was the estimate of the new survey.
p120
aVThen it just took another three months
p121
aVfor [the] U.N. to get it into their server,
p122
aVand on Friday we got the new trend line \u2014
p123
aVit was down here.
p124
aVIsn't it nice \u2014 isn't it nice, yeah?
p125
aVI was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer,
p126
aVand I saw the death rate fall
p127
aVfrom 128 to 84 just that morning.
p128
aVSo we celebrated.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut now, when you have this trend line,
p131
aVhow do we measure progress?
p132
aVI'm going into some details here,
p133
aVbecause [the] U.N. do it like this.
p134
aVThey start [in] 1990 \u2014 they measure to 2009.
p135
aVThey say, "0.9 percent, no progress."
p136
aVThat's unfair.
p137
aVAs a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently.
p138
aVI would say, at least do this \u2014
p139
aV10 years is enough to follow the trend.
p140
aVIt's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now.
p141
aVThey have 2.4 percent.
p142
aVHad I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya,
p143
aVI may have joined these two points.
p144
aVSo what I'm telling you
p145
aVis that we know the child mortality.
p146
aVWe have a decent trend.
p147
aVIt's coming into some tricky things then
p148
aVwhen we are measuring MDGs.
p149
aVAnd the reason here for Africa is especially important,
p150
aVbecause '90s was a bad decade,
p151
aVnot only in Kenya, but across Africa.
p152
aVThe HIV epidemic peaked.
p153
aVThere was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs.
p154
aVWe got, later, the mosquito netting.
p155
aVAnd there was socio-economic problems,
p156
aVwhich are now being solved at a much better scale.
p157
aVSo look at the average here \u2014
p158
aVthis is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa.
p159
aVAnd [the] U.N. says
p160
aVit's a reduction with 1.8 percent.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow this sounds a little theoretical,
p163
aVbut it's not so theoretical.
p164
aVYou know, these economists,
p165
aVthey love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow.
p166
aVSo they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy.
p167
aVWe in public health, we hate child death,
p168
aVso we want less and less and less of child deaths.
p169
aVSo we calculate the percent reduction per year,
p170
aVbut it's sort of the same percentage.
p171
aVIf your economy grows with four percent,
p172
aVyou ought to reduce child mortality four percent;
p173
aVif it's used well and people are really involved
p174
aVand can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.
p175
aVSo is this fair now to measure this over 19 years?
p176
aVAn economist would never do that.
p177
aVI have just divided it into two periods.
p178
aVIn the 90s, only 1.2 percent,
p179
aVonly 1.2 percent.
p180
aVWhereas now, second gear \u2014
p181
aVit's like Africa had first gear,
p182
aVnow they go into second gear.
p183
aVBut even this
p184
aVis not a fair representation of Africa,
p185
aVbecause it's an average,
p186
aVit's an average speed of reduction in Africa.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd look here when I take you into my bubble graphs.
p189
aVStill here,
p190
aVchild death per 1,000 on that axis.
p191
aVHere we have [the] year.
p192
aVAnd I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG.
p193
aVI start 50 years ago
p194
aVwhen Africa celebrated independence in most countries.
p195
aVI give you Congo, which was high,
p196
aVGhana \u2014 lower. And Kenya \u2014 even lower.
p197
aVAnd what has happened over the years since then? Here we go.
p198
aVYou can see, with independence, literacy improved
p199
aVand vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated,
p200
aVhygiene was improved, and things got better.
p201
aVBut then, in the '80s, watch out here.
p202
aVCongo got into civil war,
p203
aVand they leveled off here.
p204
aVGhana got very ahead, fast.
p205
aVThis was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed,
p206
aVbut then Kenya and Ghana go down together \u2014
p207
aVstill a standstill in Congo.
p208
aVThat's where we are today.
p209
aVYou can see it doesn't make sense
p210
aVto make an average of this zero improvement
p211
aVand this very fast improvement.
p212
aVTime has come
p213
aVto stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place.
p214
aVTheir countries are so different,
p215
aVand they merit to be recognized in the same way,
p216
aVas we don't talk about Europe as one place.
p217
aVI can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different \u2014
p218
aVeveryone knows that.
p219
aVAnd they are judged, each country, on how they are doing.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo let me show the wider picture.
p222
aVMy country, Sweden:
p223
aV1800, we were up there.
p224
aVWhat a strange personality disorder we must have,
p225
aVcounting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate.
p226
aVIt's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing.
p227
aVBut we had that habit in Sweden, you know,
p228
aVthat we counted all the child deaths,
p229
aVeven if we didn't do anything about it.
p230
aVAnd then, you see, these were famine years.
p231
aVThese were bad years, and people got fed up with Sweden.
p232
aVMy ancestors moved to the United States.
p233
aVAnd eventually, soon they started to get better and better here.
p234
aVAnd here we got better education, and we got health service,
p235
aVand child mortality came down.
p236
aVWe never had a war; Sweden was in peace all this time.
p237
aVBut look, the rate of lowering
p238
aVin Sweden
p239
aVwas not fast.
p240
aVSweden achieved a low child mortality
p241
aVbecause we started early.
p242
aVWe had primary school actually
p243
aVstarted in 1842.
p244
aVAnd then you get that wonderful effect
p245
aVwhen we got female literacy
p246
aVone generation later.
p247
aVYou have to realize that the investments we do in progress
p248
aVare long-term investments.
p249
aVIt's not about just five years \u2014
p250
aVit's long-term investments.
p251
aVAnd Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate,
p252
aV3.1 percent when I calculated.
p253
aVSo we are off track \u2014 that's what Sweden is.
p254
aVBut you don't talk about it so much.
p255
aVWe want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better.
p256
aa(lp257
VLet me show you Thailand,
p258
aVsee what a success story, Thailand from the 1960s \u2014
p259
aVhow they went down here
p260
aVand reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden.
p261
aVAnd I'll give you another story \u2014 Egypt,
p262
aVthe most hidden, glorious success in public health.
p263
aVEgypt was up here in 1960,
p264
aVhigher than Congo.
p265
aVThe Nile Delta was a misery for children
p266
aVwith diarrheal disease
p267
aVand malaria and a lot of problems.
p268
aVAnd then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes,
p269
aVthey increased education
p270
aVand they got primary health care.
p271
aVAnd down they went, you know.
p272
aVAnd they got safer water, they eradicated malaria.
p273
aVAnd isn't it a success story.
p274
aVMillennium Development Goal rates for child mortality
p275
aVis fully possible.
p276
aVAnd the good thing is
p277
aVthat Ghana today is going with the same rate
p278
aVas Egypt did at its fastest.
p279
aVKenya is now speeding up.
p280
aVHere we have a problem.
p281
aVWe have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, let me now bring you to a wider picture,
p284
aVa wider picture of child mortality.
p285
aVI'm going to show you the relationship
p286
aVbetween child mortality on this axis here \u2014
p287
aVthis axis here is child mortality \u2014
p288
aVand here I have the family size.
p289
aVThe relationship between child mortality and family size.
p290
aVOne, two, three, four children per woman:
p291
aVsix, seven, eight children per woman.
p292
aVThis is, once again, 1960 \u2014
p293
aV50 years ago.
p294
aVEach bubble is a country \u2014
p295
aVthe color, you can see, a continent.
p296
aVThe dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa.
p297
aVAnd the size of the bubble is the population.
p298
aVAnd these are
p299
aVthe so-called "developing" countries.
p300
aVThey had high, or very high, child mortality
p301
aVand family size, six to eight.
p302
aVAnd the ones over there,
p303
aVthey were so-called Western countries.
p304
aVThey had low child mortality
p305
aVand small families.
p306
aVWhat has happened?
p307
aVWhat I want you [to do] now is to see with your own eyes
p308
aVthe relation between fall in child mortality
p309
aVand decrease in family size.
p310
aVI just want not to have any room for doubt \u2014
p311
aVyou have to see that for yourself.
p312
aVThis is what happened. Now I start the world.
p313
aVHere we come down with the eradication of
p314
aVsmallpox, better education,
p315
aVhealth service.
p316
aVIt got down there \u2014 China comes into the Western box here.
p317
aVAnd here Brazil is in the Western Box.
p318
aVIndia is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box,
p319
aVand we get a lot a new neighbors.
p320
aVWelcome to a decent life.
p321
aVCome on. We want everyone down there.
p322
aVThis is the vision we have, isn't it.
p323
aVAnd look now, the first African countries here are coming in.
p324
aVThere we are today.
p325
aa(lp326
VThere is no such thing
p327
aVas a "Western world" and "developing world."
p328
aVThis is the report from [the] U.N.,
p329
aVwhich came out on Friday.
p330
aVIt's very good \u2014 "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" \u2014
p331
aVexcept this page.
p332
aVThis page is very bad;
p333
aVit's a categorization of countries.
p334
aVIt labels "developing countries," \u2014 I can read from the list here \u2014
p335
aVdeveloping countries: Republic of Korea \u2014 South Korea.
p336
aVHuh?
p337
aVThey get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country?
p338
aVThey have here Singapore.
p339
aVThey have the lowest child mortality in the world, Singapore.
p340
aVThey bypassed Sweden five years ago,
p341
aVand they are labeled a developing country.
p342
aVThey have here Qatar.
p343
aVIt's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera.
p344
aVHow the heck could they be [a] developing country?
p345
aVThis is crap.
p346
aV(Applause)
p347
aVThe rest here is good \u2014 the rest is good.
p348
aa(lp349
VWe have to have a modern concept,
p350
aVwhich fits to the data.
p351
aVAnd we have to realize
p352
aVthat we are all going to into this, down to here.
p353
aVWhat is the importance now with the relations here.
p354
aVLook \u2014 even if we look in Africa \u2014
p355
aVthese are the African countries.
p356
aVYou can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality
p357
aVand decreasing family size,
p358
aVeven within Africa.
p359
aVIt's very clear that this is what happens.
p360
aVAnd a very important piece of research came out on Friday
p361
aVfrom the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle
p362
aVshowing that almost 50 percent
p363
aVof the fall in child mortality
p364
aVcan be attributed to female education.
p365
aVThat is, when we get girls in school,
p366
aVwe'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later,
p367
aVwhich is a secular trend which is very strong.
p368
aVThat's why we must have that long-term perspective,
p369
aVbut we must measure the impact
p370
aVover 10-year periods.
p371
aVIt's fully possible
p372
aVto get child mortality down in all of these countries
p373
aVand to get them down in the corner
p374
aVwhere we all would like to live together.
p375
aa(lp376
VAnd of course, lowering child mortality
p377
aVis a matter of utmost importance
p378
aVfrom humanitarian aspects.
p379
aVIt's a decent life for children,
p380
aVwe are talking about.
p381
aVBut it is also a strategic investment
p382
aVin the future of all mankind,
p383
aVbecause it's about the environment.
p384
aVWe will not be able to manage the environment
p385
aVand avoid the terrible climate crisis
p386
aVif we don't stabilize the world population.
p387
aVLet's be clear about that.
p388
aVAnd the way to do that,
p389
aVthat is to get child mortality down, get access to family planning
p390
aVand behind that drive female education.
p391
aVAnd that is fully possible. Let's do it.
p392
aa(lp393
VThank you very much.

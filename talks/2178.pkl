VYou've heard of your I.Q., your general intelligence,
p5
aVbut what's your Psy-Q?
p6
aVHow much do you know about what makes you tick,
p7
aVand how good are you at predicting other people's behavior
p8
aVor even your own?
p9
aVAnd how much of what you think you know about psychology is wrong?
p10
aVLet's find out by counting down the top 10 myths of psychology.
p11
aa(lp12
VYou've probably heard it said that when it comes to their psychology,
p13
aVit's almost as if men are from Mars and women are from Venus.
p14
aVBut how different are men and women really?
p15
aVTo find out, let's start by looking at something
p16
aVon which men and women really do differ
p17
aVand plotting some psychological gender differences on the same scale.
p18
aVOne thing men and women do really differ on
p19
aVis how far they can throw a ball.
p20
aVSo if we look at the data for men here,
p21
aVwe see what is called a normal distribution curve.
p22
aVA few men can throw a ball really far, and a few men not far at all,
p23
aVbut most a kind of average distance.
p24
aVAnd women share the same distribution as well,
p25
aVbut actually there's quite a big difference.
p26
aVIn fact, the average man can throw a ball further
p27
aVthan about 98 percent of all women.
p28
aVSo now let's look at what some psychological gender differences
p29
aVlook like on the same standardized scale.
p30
aVAny psychologist will tell you
p31
aVthat men are better at spatial awareness than women \u2014
p32
aVso things like map-reading,  for example \u2014 and it's true,
p33
aVbut let's have a look at the size of this difference.
p34
aVIt's tiny; the lines are so close together they almost overlap.
p35
aVIn fact, the average woman is better than 33 percent of all men,
p36
aVand of course, if that was 50 percent,
p37
aVthen the two genders would be exactly equal.
p38
aVIt's worth bearing in mind that this difference and the next one I'll show you
p39
aVare pretty much the biggest psychological gender differences
p40
aVever discovered in psychology.
p41
aVSo here's the next one.
p42
aVAny psychologist will tell you that women are better
p43
aVwith language and grammar than men.
p44
aVSo here's performance on the standardized grammar test.
p45
aVThere go the women. There go the men.
p46
aVAgain, yes, women are better on average, but the lines are so close
p47
aVthat 33 percent of men are better than the average woman,
p48
aVand again, if it was 50 percent,
p49
aVthat would represent complete gender equality.
p50
aVSo it's not really a case of Mars and Venus.
p51
aVIt's more a case of, if anything, Mars and Snickers:
p52
aVbasically the same, but one's maybe  slightly nuttier than the other.
p53
aVI won't say which.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow we've got you warmed up.
p56
aVLet's psychoanalyze you using the famous Rorschach inkblot test.
p57
aVSo you can probably see two, I dunno, two bears or two people or something.
p58
aVBut what do you think they're doing?
p59
aVPut your hand up if you think they're saying hello.
p60
aVNot many people. Okay.
p61
aVPut your hands up if you think they are high-fiving.
p62
aVOkay. What if you think they're fighting?
p63
aVOnly a few people there.
p64
aVOkay, so if you think they're saying hello or high-fiving,
p65
aVthen that means you're a friendly person.
p66
aVIf you think they're fighting,
p67
aVyou're a bit more of a  nasty, aggressive person.
p68
aVAre you a lover or a fighter, basically.
p69
aVWhat about this one?
p70
aVThis isn't really a voting one, so on  three everyone shout out what you see.
p71
aVOne, two, three. (Audience shouting)
p72
aVI heard hamster. Who said hamster?
p73
aVThat was very worrying.
p74
aVA guy there said hamster.
p75
aVWell, you should see some kind of two-legged animal here,
p76
aVand then the mirror image of them there.
p77
aVIf you didn't, then this means that you have difficulty
p78
aVprocessing complex situations where there's a lot going on.
p79
aa(lp80
VExcept, of course, it doesn't mean that at all.
p81
aVRorschach inkblot tests have basically no validity
p82
aVwhen it comes to diagnosing people's personality
p83
aVand are not used by modern-day psychologists.
p84
aVIn fact, one recent study found that when you do try
p85
aVto diagnose people's personalities using Rorschach inkblot tests,
p86
aVschizophrenia was diagnosed
p87
aVin about one sixth of apparently perfectly normal participants.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo if you didn't do that well on this,
p90
aVmaybe you are not a very visual type of person.
p91
aVSo let's do another quick quiz to find out.
p92
aVWhen making a cake, do you prefer to \u2014 so hands up for each one again \u2014
p93
aVdo you prefer to use a recipe book with pictures?
p94
aVYeah, a few people.
p95
aVHave a friend talk you through?
p96
aVOr have a go, making it up as you go along?
p97
aVQuite a few people there.
p98
aVOkay, so if you said A,
p99
aVthen this means that you are a visual learner
p100
aVand you learn best when information is presented in a visual style.
p101
aVIf you said B, it means you're an auditory learner,
p102
aVthat you learn best when information is presented to you in an auditory format.
p103
aVAnd if you said C, it means that you're a kinesthetic learner,
p104
aVthat you learn best when you get stuck in and do things with your hands.
p105
aa(lp106
VExcept, of course, as you've probably guessed,
p107
aVthat it doesn't, because the whole thing is a complete myth.
p108
aVLearning styles are made up and are  not supported by scientific evidence.
p109
aVSo we know this because in tightly controlled experimental studies,
p110
aVwhen learners are given material to learn
p111
aVeither in their preferred style or an opposite style,
p112
aVit makes no difference at all to the amount of information that they retain.
p113
aVAnd if you think about it for just a second,
p114
aVit's just obvious that this has to be true.
p115
aVIt's obvious that the best presentation format
p116
aVdepends not on you, but on what you're trying to learn.
p117
aVCould you learn to drive a car, for example,
p118
aVjust by listening to someone telling you what to do
p119
aVwith no kinesthetic experience?
p120
aVCould you solve simultaneous equations
p121
aVby talking them through in your head and without writing them down?
p122
aVCould you revise  for your architecture exams
p123
aVusing interpretive dance if you're a kinesthetic learner?
p124
aVNo. What you need to do  is match the material to be learned
p125
aVto the presentation format, not you.
p126
aa(lp127
VI know many of you are A-level students
p128
aVthat will have recently gotten your GCSE results.
p129
aVAnd if you didn't quite get what you were hoping for,
p130
aVthen you can't really blame your learning style,
p131
aVbut one thing that you might want to think about blaming is your genes.
p132
aVSo what this is all about is a recent study at University College London
p133
aVfound that 58 percent of the variation
p134
aVbetween different students and their GCSE results
p135
aVwas down to genetic factors.
p136
aVThat sounds like a very precise figure, so how can we tell?
p137
aVWell, when we want to unpack the relative contributions
p138
aVof genes and the environment,
p139
aVwhat we can do is do a twin study.
p140
aVSo identical twins share 100 percent of their environment
p141
aVand 100 percent of their genes,
p142
aVwhereas non-identical twins share 100 percent of their environment,
p143
aVbut just like any brother and sister, share only 50 percent of their genes.
p144
aVSo by comparing how similar GCSE results are in identical twins
p145
aVversus non-identical twins,
p146
aVand doing some clever math,
p147
aVwe can an idea of how much variation and performance is due to the environment
p148
aVand how much is due to genes.
p149
aVAnd it turns out that it's about 58 percent due to genes.
p150
aVSo this isn't to undermine the hard work that you and your teachers here put in.
p151
aVIf you didn't quite get the GCSE results that you were hoping for,
p152
aVthen you can always try blaming your parents, or at least their genes.
p153
aa(lp154
VOne thing that you shouldn't blame
p155
aVis being a left-brained or right-brained learner,
p156
aVbecause again, this is a myth.
p157
aVSo the myth here is that the left brain is logical,
p158
aVit's good with equations like this,
p159
aVand the right brain is more creative, so the right brain is better at music.
p160
aVBut again, this is a myth because nearly everything that you do
p161
aVinvolves nearly all parts of your brain talking together,
p162
aVeven just the most mundane thing like having a normal conversation.
p163
aVHowever, perhaps one reason why this myth has survived
p164
aVis that there is a slight grain of truth to it.
p165
aVSo a related version of the myth
p166
aVis that left-handed people are more creative than right-handed people,
p167
aVwhich kind of makes sense because your brain controls the opposite hands,
p168
aVso left-handed people,
p169
aVthe right side of the brain is slightly more active
p170
aVthan the left-hand side of the brain,
p171
aVand the idea is the right-hand side is more creative.
p172
aVNow, it isn't true per se
p173
aVthat left-handed people are more creative than right-handed people.
p174
aVWhat is true that ambidextrous people,
p175
aVor people who use both hands for different tasks,
p176
aVare more creative thinkers than one-handed people,
p177
aVbecause being ambidextrous involves
p178
aVhaving both sides of the brain talk to each other a lot,
p179
aVwhich seems to be involved in creating flexible thinking.
p180
aVThe myth of the creative left-hander
p181
aVarises from the fact that being ambidextrous
p182
aVis more common amongst  left-handers than right-handers,
p183
aVso a grain of truth in the idea of the creative left-hander,
p184
aVbut not much.
p185
aa(lp186
VA related myth that you've probably heard of
p187
aVis that we only use 10 percent of our brains.
p188
aVThis is, again, a complete myth.
p189
aVNearly everything that we do, even the most mundane thing,
p190
aVuses nearly all of our brains.
p191
aa(lp192
VThat said, it is of course true
p193
aVthat most of us don't use our brainpower quite as well as we could.
p194
aVSo what could we do to boost our brainpower?
p195
aVMaybe we could listen to a nice bit of Mozart.
p196
aVHave you heard of the idea of the Mozart effect?
p197
aVSo the idea is that listening  to Mozart makes you smarter
p198
aVand improves your  performance on I.Q. tests.
p199
aVNow again, what's interesting about this myth
p200
aVis that although it's basically a myth, there is a grain of truth to it.
p201
aVSo the original study found that
p202
aVparticipants who were played Mozart music for a few minutes
p203
aVdid better on a subsequent I.Q. test
p204
aVthan participants who simply sat in silence.
p205
aVBut a follow-up study recruited some people who liked Mozart music
p206
aVand then another group of people
p207
aVwho were fans of  the horror stories of Stephen King.
p208
aVAnd they played the people the music or the stories.
p209
aVThe people who preferred Mozart music to the stories
p210
aVgot a bigger I.Q. boost from the Mozart than the stories,
p211
aVbut the people who preferred the stories to the Mozart music
p212
aVgot a bigger I.Q. boost from listening to the Stephen King stories
p213
aVthan the Mozart music.
p214
aVSo the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy
p215
aVperks you up a bit and gives you a temporary I.Q. boost
p216
aVon a narrow range of tasks.
p217
aVThere's no suggestion that listening to Mozart,
p218
aVor indeed Stephen King stories,
p219
aVis going to make you any smarter in the long run.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnother version of the Mozart myth
p222
aVis that listening to Mozart can make you not only cleverer but healthier, too.
p223
aVUnfortunately, this doesn't seem to be true
p224
aVof someone who listened to the music of Mozart almost every day,
p225
aVMozart himself,
p226
aVwho suffered from gonorrhea, smallpox, arthritis,
p227
aVand, what most people think eventually killed him in the end, syphilis.
p228
aVThis suggests that Mozart should have bit more careful, perhaps,
p229
aVwhen choosing his sexual partners.
p230
aVBut how do we choose a partner?
p231
aa(lp232
VSo a myth that I have to say is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists
p233
aVis that our preferences in a romantic  partner are a product of our culture,
p234
aVthat they're very culturally specific.
p235
aVBut in fact, the data don't back this up.
p236
aVA famous study surveyed people from [37] different cultures across the globe,
p237
aVfrom Americans to Zulus,
p238
aVon what they look for in a partner.
p239
aVAnd in every single culture across the globe,
p240
aVmen placed more value on physical attractiveness in a partner
p241
aVthan did women,
p242
aVand in every single culture, too,
p243
aVwomen placed more importance than did men on ambition and high earning power.
p244
aVIn every culture, too,
p245
aVmen preferred women who were younger than themselves,
p246
aVan average of, I think it was 2.66 years,
p247
aVand in every culture, too,
p248
aVwomen preferred men who were older than them,
p249
aVso an average of 3.42 years,
p250
aVwhich is why we've got here "Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy."
p251
aa(lp252
VSo moving on from trying to score with a partner
p253
aVto trying to score in basketball or football or whatever your sport is.
p254
aVThe myth here is that sportsmen go through hot-hand streaks, Americans call them,
p255
aVor purple patches, we sometimes say in England,
p256
aVwhere they just can't miss, like this guy here.
p257
aVBut in fact, what happens is that if you analyze the pattern
p258
aVof hits and misses statistically,
p259
aVit turns out that it's nearly always at random.
p260
aVYour brain creates patterns from the randomness.
p261
aVIf you toss a coin,
p262
aVa streak of heads or tails is going  to come out somewhere in the randomness,
p263
aVand because the brain likes to see patterns where there are none,
p264
aVwe look at these streaks and attribute meanings to them
p265
aVand say, "Yeah he's really on form today,"
p266
aVwhereas actually you would get the same pattern
p267
aVif you were just getting hits and misses at random.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo an exception to this, however, is penalty shootouts.
p270
aVA recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football
p271
aVshows that players who represent countries
p272
aVwith a very bad record in penalty shootouts,
p273
aVlike, for example, England,
p274
aVtend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better record,
p275
aVand presumably as a result, they're more likely to miss.
p276
aa(lp277
VWhich raises the question
p278
aVof if there's any way that we could improve people's performance.
p279
aVAnd one thing you might think about doing
p280
aVis punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them.
p281
aVThis idea, the effect that punishment can improve performance,
p282
aVis what participants thought they were testing
p283
aVin Milgram's famous learning and punishment experiment
p284
aVthat you've probably heard about if you're a psychology student.
p285
aVThe story goes that participants were prepared to give
p286
aVwhat they believed to be fatal electric shocks to a fellow participant
p287
aVwhen they got a question wrong,
p288
aVjust because someone in a white coat told them to.
p289
aa(lp290
VBut this story is a myth for three reasons.
p291
aVFirstly and most crucially, the lab coat wasn't white, it was in fact grey.
p292
aVSecondly, the participants were told before the study
p293
aVand reminded any time they raised a concern,
p294
aVthat although the shocks were painful, they were not fatal
p295
aVand indeed caused no permanent damage whatsoever.
p296
aVAnd thirdly, participants didn't give the shocks
p297
aVjust because someone in the coat told them to.
p298
aVWhen they were interviewed after the study,
p299
aVall the participants said that they firmly believed
p300
aVthat the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose
p301
aVwhich would have enduring gains for science
p302
aVas opposed to the momentary nonfatal discomfort caused to the participants.
p303
aa(lp304
VOkay, so I've been talking for about 12 minutes now,
p305
aVand you've probably been  sitting there listening to me,
p306
aVanalyzing my speech patterns  and body language
p307
aVand trying to work out if you should take any notice of what I'm saying,
p308
aVwhether I'm telling the truth or whether I'm lying,
p309
aVbut if so you've probably completely failed,
p310
aVbecause although we all think we can catch a liar
p311
aVfrom their body language and speech patterns,
p312
aVhundreds of psychological tests over the years have shown
p313
aVthat all of us, including police officers and detectives,
p314
aVare basically at chance when it comes to detecting lies from body language
p315
aVand verbal patterns.
p316
aVInterestingly, there is one exception:
p317
aVTV appeals for missing relatives.
p318
aVIt's quite easy to predict when the relatives are missing
p319
aVand when the appealers have in fact murdered the relatives themselves.
p320
aVSo hoax appealers are more likely to shake their heads, to look away,
p321
aVand to make errors in their speech,
p322
aVwhereas genuine appealers are more likely
p323
aVto express hope that the person will return safely
p324
aVand to avoid brutal language.
p325
aVSo, for example, they might say "taken from us" rather than "killed."
p326
aa(lp327
VSpeaking of which, it's about time I killed this talk,
p328
aVbut before I do, I just want  to give you in 30 seconds
p329
aVthe overarching myth of psychology.
p330
aVSo the myth is that psychology is just a collection of interesting theories,
p331
aVall of which say something useful and all of which have something to offer.
p332
aVWhat I hope to have shown you in the past few minutes
p333
aVis that this isn't true.
p334
aVWhat we need to do is assess psychological theories
p335
aVby seeing what predictions they make,
p336
aVwhether that is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter,
p337
aVthat you learn better when information is presented in your preferred learning style
p338
aVor whatever it is, all of these are testable empirical predictions,
p339
aVand the only way we can make progress
p340
aVis to test these predictions against the data
p341
aVin tightly controlled experimental studies.
p342
aVAnd it's only by doing so that we can hope to discover
p343
aVwhich of these theories are well supported,
p344
aVand which, like all the ones I've told you about today, are myths.
p345
aa(lp346
VThank you.

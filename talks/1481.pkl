VThose of you who have seen the film "Moneyball,"
p5
aVor have read the book by Michael Lewis,
p6
aVwill be familiar with the story of Billy Beane.
p7
aVBilly was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer; all the scouts told him so.
p8
aVThey told his parents that
p9
aVthey predicted that he was going to be a star.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut what actually happened when he signed the contract \u2014 and by the way, he didn't
p12
aVwant to sign that contract, he wanted to go to college \u2014
p13
aVwhich is what my mother, who actually does love me,
p14
aVsaid that I should do too, and I did \u2014
p15
aVwell, he didn't do very well. He struggled mightily.
p16
aVHe got traded a couple of times, he ended up in the Minors for most of his career,
p17
aVand he actually ended up in management. He ended up as a General Manager of the
p18
aVOakland A's.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow for many of you in this room, ending up in management, which is also what I've done,
p21
aVis seen as a success.
p22
aVI can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs,
p23
aVgoing into management ain't no success story. It's a failure.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd what I want to talk to you about today, and share with you, is that our
p26
aVhealthcare system, our medical system, is just as bad at predicting
p27
aVwhat happens to people in it \u2014 patients, others \u2014
p28
aVas those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane.
p29
aVAnd yet, every day
p30
aVthousands of people in this country
p31
aVare diagnosed with preconditions.
p32
aa(lp33
VWe hear about pre-hypertension, we hear about pre-dementia,
p34
aVwe hear about pre-anxiety, and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with
p35
aVthat in the green room.
p36
aa(lp37
VWe also refer to subclinical conditions.
p38
aVThere's subclinical atherosclerosis, subclinical hardening of the arteries,
p39
aVobviously linked to heart attacks, potentially.
p40
aVOne of my favorites is called subclinical acne.
p41
aVIf you look up subclinical acne, you may find a website, which I did,
p42
aVwhich says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat.
p43
aVYou don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation.
p44
aVMaybe that's because you don't actually have acne.
p45
aa(lp46
VI have a name for all of these conditions, it's another precondition:
p47
aVI call them preposterous.
p48
aVIn baseball, the game follows the pre-game.
p49
aVSeason follows the pre-season.
p50
aVBut with a lot of these conditions, that actually isn't the case, or at least it isn't the
p51
aVcase all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay, every single time in many cases.
p52
aa(lp53
VWe have pre-cancerous lesions,
p54
aVwhich often don't turn into cancer.
p55
aVAnd yet,
p56
aVif you take, for example, subclinical osteoporosis, a bone thinning disease,
p57
aVthe precondition,
p58
aVotherwise known as osteopenia,
p59
aVyou would have to treat 270 women for three years
p60
aVin order to prevent one broken bone.
p61
aVThat's an awful lot of women
p62
aVwhen you multiply by the number of women who were diagnosed
p63
aVwith this osteopenia.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd so is it any wonder,
p66
aVgiven all of the costs and the side effects
p67
aVof the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions, that every year
p68
aVwe're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet
p69
aV100,000 people a year \u2014 and that's a conservative estimate \u2014 are dying
p70
aVnot because of the conditions they have,
p71
aVbut because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments?
p72
aa(lp73
VWe've medicalized everything
p74
aVin this country.
p75
aVWomen in the audience, I have some
p76
aVpretty bad news that you already know,
p77
aVand that's that every aspect of your life
p78
aa(lp79
Vhas been medicalized.
p80
aVStrike one is when you hit puberty.
p81
aVYou now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized.
p82
aVIt's a condition;
p83
aVit has to be treated. Strike two
p84
aVis if you get pregnant.
p85
aVThat's been medicalized as well.
p86
aVYou have to have a high-tech experience
p87
aVof pregnancy, otherwise something might go wrong.
p88
aa(lp89
VStrike three is menopause.
p90
aVWe all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy
p91
aVfor menopausal symptoms
p92
aVfor decades until all of a sudden we realized, because a study came out, a big one,
p93
aVNIH-funded.
p94
aVIt said,
p95
aVactually, a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good
p96
aVfor many of those women.
p97
aa(lp98
VJust in case,
p99
aVI don't want to leave the men out \u2014
p100
aVI am one, after all \u2014
p101
aVI have really bad news for all of you in this room,
p102
aVand for everyone
p103
aVlistening and watching elsewhere:
p104
aVYou all have
p105
aVa universally fatal condition.
p106
aVSo, just take a moment.
p107
aVIt's called pre-death.
p108
aVEvery single one of you has it, because you have the risk factor for it,
p109
aVwhich is being alive.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut I have some good news for you, because
p112
aVI'm a journalist, I like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way.
p113
aVAnd that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk, which
p114
aVwe'll see if that happens for everyone,
p115
aVyou will be a pre-vivor.
p116
aa(lp117
VI made up pre-death.
p118
aVIf I used someone else's pre-death, I apologize,
p119
aVI think I made it up.
p120
aVI didn't make up pre-vivor.
p121
aVPre-vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who
p122
aVjust has a risk factor,
p123
aVbut hasn't actually had that cancer,
p124
aVto call themselves.
p125
aVYou are a pre-vivor.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the
p128
aVaudience, I'd like to suggest
p129
aVa reality TV show called "Pre-vivor."
p130
aVIf you develop a disease, you're off the island.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut the problem is, we have a system
p133
aVthat is completely \u2014
p134
aVbasically promoted this.
p135
aVWe've selected, at every point in this system,
p136
aVto do what we do, and to give everyone a precondition and then eventually
p137
aVa condition, in some cases.
p138
aVStart with the doctor-patient relationship. Doctors, most of them,
p139
aVare in a fee-for-service system. They are basically incentivized to do more \u2014
p140
aVprocedures, tests,
p141
aVprescribe medications.
p142
aa(lp143
VPatients come to them,
p144
aVthey want to do something. We're Americans, we can't just stand
p145
aVthere, we have to do something. And so they want a drug.
p146
aVThey want a treatment. They want to be told, this is what you have and this is how
p147
aVyou treat it. If the doctor doesn't give you that,
p148
aVyou go somewhere else.
p149
aVThat's not very good for doctors' business.
p150
aVOr even worse,
p151
aVif you are diagnosed with something eventually, and the doctor didn't order that test,
p152
aVyou get sued.
p153
aa(lp154
VWe have pharmaceutical companies that are constantly trying to expand
p155
aVthe indications, expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment,
p156
aVbecause that obviously helps their bottom line. We have advocacy groups,
p157
aVlike the one that's come up with pre-vivor,
p158
aVwho want to make more and more people feel they are at risk, or might have a condition,
p159
aVso that they can raise more funds
p160
aVand raise visibility, et cetera.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut this isn't actually,
p163
aVdespite what journalists typically do, this isn't actually about blaming
p164
aVparticular players.
p165
aVWe are all responsible.
p166
aVI'm responsible.
p167
aVI actually root for the Yankees, I mean talk about
p168
aVrooting for the worst possible
p169
aVoffender when it comes to doing everything you can do.
p170
aVThank you.
p171
aVBut everyone is responsible.
p172
aa(lp173
VI went to medical school,
p174
aVand I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically,
p175
aVor How Not to Order Tests.
p176
aVWe have this system
p177
aVwhere that's what you do.
p178
aVAnd it actually took being a journalist
p179
aVto understand all these incentives. You know, economists like to say,
p180
aVthere are no bad people,
p181
aVthere are just bad incentives.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd that's actually true.
p184
aVBecause what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams, when it comes to medical technology.
p185
aVSo when you put another MRI in every corner, you put a robot
p186
aVin every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery.
p187
aVWell, we've created a system where if you build it, they will come.
p188
aVBut you can actually perversely
p189
aVtell people to come, convince them
p190
aVthat they have to come.
p191
aa(lp192
VIt was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem,
p193
aVand how we all are part of this problem.
p194
aVI was medicalizing every risk factor, I was writing stories, commissioning stories,
p195
aVevery day, that were trying to,
p196
aVnot necessarily make people worried, although that was what often happened.
p197
aa(lp198
VBut, you know, there are ways out.
p199
aVI saw my own internist last week,
p200
aVand he said to me,
p201
aV"You know," and he told me something that
p202
aVeveryone in this audience could have told me for free,
p203
aVbut I paid him for the privilege, which is that
p204
aVI need to lose some weight.
p205
aVWell, he's right. I've had honest-to-goodness high blood pressure
p206
aVfor a dozen years now, same
p207
aVage my father got it,
p208
aVand it's a real disease. It's not pre-hypertension, it's actual
p209
aVhypertension, high blood pressure.
p210
aa(lp211
VWell, he's right,
p212
aVbut he didn't say to me,
p213
aVwell, you have pre-obesity or
p214
aVyou have pre-diabetes, or anything like that. He didn't say,
p215
aVbetter start taking this Statin, you need to lower your cholesterol.
p216
aVNo, he said, "Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit,
p217
aVor just give me a call and let me know how you're doing."
p218
aa(lp219
VSo that's, to me,
p220
aVa way forward.
p221
aVBilly Beane, by the way, learned the same thing.
p222
aVHe learned,
p223
aVfrom watching this kid who he eventually hired, who was really successful for him,
p224
aVthat it wasn't swinging for the fences, it wasn't swinging at every pitch
p225
aVlike the sluggers do, which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to \u2014
p226
aVthey like to pick up those guys.
p227
aVThis kid told him, you know, you gotta watch the guys, and you gotta go out and find
p228
aVthe guys who like to walk,
p229
aVbecause getting on base by a walk
p230
aVis just as good, and in our healthcare system
p231
aVwe need to figure out,
p232
aVis that really a good pitch
p233
aVor should we let it go by and not swing at everything?
p234
aVThanks.

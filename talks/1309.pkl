VI study how the brain processes
p5
aVinformation. That is, how it takes
p6
aVinformation in from the outside world, and
p7
aVconverts it into patterns of electrical activity,
p8
aVand then how it uses those patterns
p9
aVto allow you to do things \u2014
p10
aVto see, hear, to reach for an object.
p11
aVSo I'm really a basic scientist, not
p12
aVa clinician, but in the last year and a half
p13
aVI've started to switch over, to use what
p14
aVwe've been learning about these patterns
p15
aVof activity to develop prosthetic devices,
p16
aVand what I wanted to do today is show you
p17
aVan example of this.
p18
aVIt's really our first foray into this.
p19
aVIt's the development of a prosthetic device
p20
aVfor treating blindness.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo let me start in on that problem.
p23
aVThere are 10 million people in the U.S.
p24
aVand many more worldwide who are blind
p25
aVor are facing blindness due to diseases
p26
aVof the retina, diseases like
p27
aVmacular degeneration, and there's little
p28
aVthat can be done for them.
p29
aVThere are some drug treatments, but
p30
aVthey're only effective on a small fraction
p31
aVof the population. And so, for the vast
p32
aVmajority of patients, their best hope for
p33
aVregaining sight is through prosthetic devices.
p34
aVThe problem is that current prosthetics
p35
aVdon't work very well. They're still very
p36
aVlimited in the vision that they can provide.
p37
aVAnd so, you know, for example, with these
p38
aVdevices, patients can see simple things
p39
aVlike bright lights and high contrast edges,
p40
aVnot very much more, so nothing close
p41
aVto normal vision has been possible.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo what I'm going to tell you about today
p44
aVis a device that we've been working on
p45
aVthat I think has the potential to make
p46
aVa difference, to be much more effective,
p47
aVand what I wanted to do is show you
p48
aVhow it works. Okay, so let me back up a
p49
aVlittle bit and show you how a normal retina
p50
aVworks first so you can see the problem
p51
aVthat we were trying to solve.
p52
aVHere you have a retina.
p53
aVSo you have an image, a retina, and a brain.
p54
aVSo when you look at something, like this image
p55
aVof this baby's face, it goes into your eye
p56
aVand it lands on your retina, on the front-end
p57
aVcells here, the photoreceptors.
p58
aVThen what happens is the retinal circuitry,
p59
aVthe middle part, goes to work on it,
p60
aVand what it does is it performs operations
p61
aVon it, it extracts information from it, and it
p62
aVconverts that information into a code.
p63
aVAnd the code is in the form of these patterns
p64
aVof electrical pulses that get sent
p65
aVup to the brain, and so the key thing is
p66
aVthat the image ultimately gets converted
p67
aVinto a code. And when I say code,
p68
aVI do literally mean code.
p69
aVLike this pattern of pulses here actually means "baby's face,"
p70
aVand so when the brain gets this pattern
p71
aVof pulses, it knows that what was out there
p72
aVwas a baby's face, and if it
p73
aVgot a different pattern it would know
p74
aVthat what was out there was, say, a dog,
p75
aVor another pattern would be a house.
p76
aVAnyway, you get the idea.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd, of course, in real life, it's all dynamic,
p79
aVmeaning that it's changing all the time,
p80
aVso the patterns of pulses are changing
p81
aVall the time because the world you're
p82
aVlooking at is changing all the time too.
p83
aVSo, you know, it's sort of a complicated
p84
aVthing. You have these patterns of pulses
p85
aVcoming out of your eye every millisecond
p86
aVtelling your brain what it is that you're seeing.
p87
aVSo what happens when a person
p88
aVgets a retinal degenerative disease like
p89
aVmacular degeneration? What happens is
p90
aVis that, the front-end cells die,
p91
aVthe photoreceptors die, and over time,
p92
aVall the cells and the circuits that are
p93
aVconnected to them, they die too.
p94
aVUntil the only things that you have left
p95
aVare these cells here, the output cells,
p96
aVthe ones that send the signals to the brain,
p97
aVbut because of all that degeneration
p98
aVthey aren't sending any signals anymore.
p99
aVThey aren't getting any input, so
p100
aVthe person's brain no longer gets
p101
aVany visual information \u2014
p102
aVthat is, he or she is blind.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo, a solution to the problem, then,
p105
aVwould be to build a device that could mimic
p106
aVthe actions of that front-end circuitry
p107
aVand send signals to the retina's output cells,
p108
aVand they can go back to doing their
p109
aVnormal job of sending signals to the brain.
p110
aVSo this is what we've been working on,
p111
aVand this is what our prosthetic does.
p112
aVSo it consists of two parts, what we call
p113
aVan encoder and a transducer.
p114
aVAnd so the encoder does just
p115
aVwhat I was saying: it mimics the actions
p116
aVof the front-end circuitry \u2014 so it takes images
p117
aVin and converts them into the retina's code.
p118
aVAnd then the transducer then makes the
p119
aVoutput cells send the code on up
p120
aVto the brain, and the result is
p121
aVa retinal prosthetic that can produce
p122
aVnormal retinal output.
p123
aVSo a completely blind retina,
p124
aVeven one with no front-end circuitry at all,
p125
aVno photoreceptors,
p126
aVcan now send out normal signals,
p127
aVsignals that the brain can understand.
p128
aVSo no other device has been able
p129
aVto do this.
p130
aa(lp131
VOkay, so I just want to take
p132
aVa sentence or two to say something about
p133
aVthe encoder and what it's doing, because
p134
aVit's really the key part and it's
p135
aVsort of interesting and kind of cool.
p136
aVI'm not sure "cool" is really the right word, but
p137
aVyou know what I mean.
p138
aVSo what it's doing is, it's replacing
p139
aVthe retinal circuitry, really the guts of
p140
aVthe retinal circuitry, with a set of equations,
p141
aVa set of equations that we can implement
p142
aVon a chip. So it's just math.
p143
aVIn other words, we're not literally replacing
p144
aVthe components of the retina.
p145
aVIt's not like we're making a little mini-device
p146
aVfor each of the different cell types.
p147
aVWe've just abstracted what the
p148
aVretina's doing with a set of equations.
p149
aVAnd so, in a way, the equations are serving
p150
aVas sort of a codebook. An image comes in,
p151
aVgoes through the set of equations,
p152
aVand out comes streams of electrical pulses,
p153
aVjust like a normal retina would produce.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow let me put my money
p156
aVwhere my mouth is and show you that
p157
aVwe can actually produce normal output,
p158
aVand what the implications of this are.
p159
aVHere are three sets of
p160
aVfiring patterns. The top one is from
p161
aVa normal animal, the middle one is from
p162
aVa blind animal that's been treated with
p163
aVthis encoder-transducer device, and the
p164
aVbottom one is from a blind animal treated
p165
aVwith a standard prosthetic.
p166
aVSo the bottom one is the state-of-the-art
p167
aVdevice that's out there right now, which is
p168
aVbasically made up of light detectors,
p169
aVbut no encoder. So what we did was we
p170
aVpresented movies of everyday things \u2014
p171
aVpeople, babies, park benches,
p172
aVyou know, regular things happening \u2014 and
p173
aVwe recorded the responses from the retinas
p174
aVof these three groups of animals.
p175
aVNow just to orient you, each box is showing
p176
aVthe firing patterns of several cells,
p177
aVand just as in the previous slides,
p178
aVeach row is a different cell,
p179
aVand I just made the pulses a little bit smaller
p180
aVand thinner so I could show you
p181
aVa long stretch of data.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo as you can see, the firing patterns
p184
aVfrom the blind animal treated with
p185
aVthe encoder-transducer really do very
p186
aVclosely match the normal firing patterns \u2014
p187
aVand it's not perfect, but it's pretty good \u2014
p188
aVand the blind animal treated with
p189
aVthe standard prosthetic,
p190
aVthe responses really don't.
p191
aVAnd so with the standard method,
p192
aVthe cells do fire, they just don't fire
p193
aVin the normal firing patterns because
p194
aVthey don't have the right code.
p195
aVHow important is this?
p196
aVWhat's the potential impact
p197
aVon a patient's ability to see?
p198
aVSo I'm just going to show you one
p199
aVbottom-line experiment that answers this,
p200
aVand of course I've got a lot of other data,
p201
aVso if you're interested I'm happy
p202
aVto show more. So the experiment
p203
aVis called a reconstruction experiment.
p204
aVSo what we did is we took a moment
p205
aVin time from these recordings and asked,
p206
aVwhat was the retina seeing at that moment?
p207
aVCan we reconstruct what the retina
p208
aVwas seeing from the responses
p209
aVfrom the firing patterns?
p210
aa(lp211
VSo, when we did this for responses
p212
aVfrom the standard method and from
p213
aVour encoder and transducer.
p214
aVSo let me show you, and I'm going to
p215
aVstart with the standard method first.
p216
aVSo you can see that it's pretty limited,
p217
aVand because the firing patterns aren't
p218
aVin the right code, they're very limited in
p219
aVwhat they can tell you about
p220
aVwhat's out there. So you can see that
p221
aVthere's something there, but it's not so clear
p222
aVwhat that something is, and this just sort of
p223
aVcircles back to what I was saying in the
p224
aVbeginning, that with the standard method,
p225
aVpatients can see high-contrast edges, they
p226
aVcan see light, but it doesn't easily go
p227
aVfurther than that. So what was
p228
aVthe image? It was a baby's face.
p229
aVSo what about with our approach,
p230
aVadding the code? And you can see
p231
aVthat it's much better. Not only can you
p232
aVtell that it's a baby's face, but you can
p233
aVtell that it's this baby's face, which is a
p234
aVreally challenging task.
p235
aVSo on the left is the encoder
p236
aValone, and on the right is from an actual
p237
aVblind retina, so the encoder and the transducer.
p238
aVBut the key one really is the encoder alone,
p239
aVbecause we can team up the encoder with
p240
aVthe different transducer.
p241
aa(lp242
VThis is just actually the first one that we tried.
p243
aVI just wanted to say something about the standard method.
p244
aVWhen this first came out, it was just a really
p245
aVexciting thing, the idea that you
p246
aVeven make a blind retina respond at all.
p247
aVBut there was this limiting factor,
p248
aVthe issue of the code, and how to make
p249
aVthe cells respond better,
p250
aVproduce normal responses,
p251
aVand so this was our contribution.
p252
aVNow I just want to wrap up,
p253
aVand as I was mentioning earlier
p254
aVof course I have a lot of other data
p255
aVif you're interested, but I just wanted to give
p256
aVthis sort of basic idea
p257
aVof being able to communicate
p258
aVwith the brain in its language, and
p259
aVthe potential power of being able to do that.
p260
aVSo it's different from the motor prosthetics
p261
aVwhere you're communicating from the brain
p262
aVto a device. Here we have to communicate
p263
aVfrom the outside world
p264
aVinto the brain and be understood,
p265
aVand be understood by the brain.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd then the last thing I wanted
p268
aVto say, really, is to emphasize
p269
aVthat the idea generalizes.
p270
aVSo the same strategy that we used
p271
aVto find the code for the retina we can also
p272
aVuse to find the code for other areas,
p273
aVfor example, the auditory system and
p274
aVthe motor system, so for treating deafness
p275
aVand for motor disorders.
p276
aVSo just the same way that we were able to
p277
aVjump over the damaged
p278
aVcircuitry in the retina to get to the retina's
p279
aVoutput cells, we can jump over the
p280
aVdamaged circuitry in the cochlea
p281
aVto get the auditory nerve,
p282
aVor jump over damaged areas in the cortex,
p283
aVin the motor cortex, to bridge the gap
p284
aVproduced by a stroke.
p285
aa(lp286
VI just want to end with a simple
p287
aVmessage that understanding the code
p288
aVis really, really important, and if we
p289
aVcan understand the code,
p290
aVthe language of the brain, things become
p291
aVpossible that didn't seem obviously
p292
aVpossible before. Thank you.

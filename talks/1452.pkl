VSo, I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit.
p5
aVForty-two million people
p6
aVwere displaced by natural disasters in 2010.
p7
aVNow, there was nothing particularly special about 2010,
p8
aVbecause, on average, 31 and a half million people
p9
aVare displaced by natural disasters every single year.
p10
aVNow, usually when people hear statistics or stats like that,
p11
aVyou start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of
p12
aVexotic or maybe even impoverished areas, but it happens
p13
aVright here in the United States every single year.
p14
aVLast year alone, 99 federally declared disasters
p15
aVwere on file with FEMA,
p16
aVfrom Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
p17
aVto the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently.
p18
aVNow, how does the most powerful country in the world
p19
aVhandle these displaced people?
p20
aVThey cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings
p21
aVin a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath,
p22
aVand put you on the floor of an entire sports arena,
p23
aVor a gymnasium.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo obviously there's a massive housing gap,
p26
aVand this really upset me, because academia tells you
p27
aVafter a major disaster, there's typically about
p28
aVan 18-month time frame to \u2014 we kinda recover,
p29
aVstart the recovery process,
p30
aVbut what most people don't realize is that on average
p31
aVit takes 45 to 60 days or more
p32
aVfor the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up.
p33
aVBefore that time, people are left to their own devices.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way
p36
aVto actually fill this gap.
p37
aVThis actually became my creative obsession.
p38
aVI put aside all my freelance work after hours and started
p39
aVjust focusing particularly on this problem.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo I started sketching.
p42
aVTwo days after Katrina, I started sketching and sketching
p43
aVand trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this,
p44
aVand as things started to congeal or ideas started to form,
p45
aVI started sketching digitally on the computer,
p46
aVbut it was an obsession, so I couldn't just stop there.
p47
aVI started experimenting, making models,
p48
aVtalking to experts in the field, taking their feedback,
p49
aVand refining, and I kept on refining and refining
p50
aVfor nights and weekends for over five years.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, my obsession ended up driving me to create
p53
aVfull-size prototypes in my own backyard \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p54
aVand actually spending my own personal savings on
p55
aVeverything from tooling to patents
p56
aVand a variety of other costs,
p57
aVbut in the end I ended up with this modular housing system
p58
aVthat can react to any situation or disaster.
p59
aVIt can be put up in any environment,
p60
aVfrom an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields,
p61
aVbecause it doesn't require any special setup
p62
aVor specialty tools.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, at the foundation and kind of the core
p65
aVof this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit,
p66
aVwhich is just the individual shelter module.
p67
aVAnd though it's light, light enough that you can actually
p68
aVlift it by hand and move it around,
p69
aVand it actually sleeps four people.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd you can arrange these things as kind of more
p72
aVfor encampments and more of a city grid type layout,
p73
aVor you can circle the wagons, essentially,
p74
aVand form these circular pods out of them,
p75
aVwhich give you this semi-private communal area
p76
aVfor people to actually spill out into so they're not actually
p77
aVtrapped inside these units.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow this fundamentally changes
p80
aVthe way we respond to disasters,
p81
aVbecause gone are the horrid conditions
p82
aVinside a sports arena or a gymnasium, where people
p83
aVare crammed on these cots inside.
p84
aVNow we have instant neighborhoods outside.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo the Exo is designed to be simply, basically
p87
aVlike a coffee cup. They can actually stack together
p88
aVso we get extremely efficient transportation
p89
aVand storage out of them.
p90
aVIn fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself.
p91
aVThis means the Exo can actually be transported and set up
p92
aVfaster than any other housing option available today.
p93
aVBut I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there,
p94
aVso I actually started modifying the bunks where you could
p95
aVactually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving,
p96
aVso the same unit can now be used
p97
aVfor an office or storage location.
p98
aVThe doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on
p99
aVa rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control,
p100
aVor a connector module that would allow you to actually
p101
aVconnect multiple units together, which gives you
p102
aVlarger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces,
p103
aVso now this same kit of parts, this same unit
p104
aVcan actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom,
p105
aVor an office, a living space and secure storage.
p106
aa(lp107
VSounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real?
p108
aVSo the first idea I had, initially, was just
p109
aVto go the federal and state governments and go,
p110
aV"Here, take it, for free."
p111
aVBut I was quickly told that, "Boy, our government
p112
aVdoesn't really work like that." (Laughter)
p113
aVOkay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit
p114
aVto kind of help consult and get this idea going
p115
aValong with the government, but then I was told,
p116
aV"Son, our government looks to private sector
p117
aVfor things like this."
p118
aVOkay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go
p119
aVto private corporations that would have this mutually shared
p120
aVbenefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations
p121
aVthat my personal passion project was not a brand fit
p122
aVbecause they didn't want their logos stamped
p123
aVacross the ghettos of Haiti.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged. (Laughter.)
p126
aVSo I decided, kind of told myself,
p127
aV"Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself." (Laughter)
p128
aVNow, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of
p129
aVour Milan office for a few months, so I was like,
p130
aVwhat will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar,
p131
aVand spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls
p132
aVwith material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers.
p133
aVAnd we found through this whole process, we found
p134
aVthis great little manufacturer in Virginia,
p135
aVand if his body language is any indication,
p136
aVthat's the owner \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 of what it's like
p137
aVfor a manufacturer to work directly with a designer,
p138
aVyou've got to see what happens here. (Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VBut G.S. Industries was fantastic.
p141
aVThey actually built three prototypes for us by hand.
p142
aVSo now we have prototypes that can show that four people
p143
aVcan actually sleep securely and much more comfortably
p144
aVthan a tent could ever provide.
p145
aVAnd they actually shipped them here to Texas for us.
p146
aVNow, a funny thing started happening.
p147
aVOther people started to believe in what we were doing,
p148
aVand actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar
p149
aVspace to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority
p150
aVwas bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed.
p151
aVSo now we had a hangar space to work in,
p152
aVand prototypes to demo with.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo in one year, we've negotiated manufacturing agreements,
p155
aVbeen awarded one patent, filed our second patent,
p156
aVtalked to multiple people, demoed this to FEMA
p157
aVand its consultants to rave reviews,
p158
aVand then started talking to some other people who requested
p159
aVinformation, this little group called the United Nations.
p160
aVAnd on top of that, now we have
p161
aVa whole plethora of other individuals that have come up
p162
aVand started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps,
p163
aVmobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup
p164
aVand the Olympics.
p165
aVSo, in closing, on this whole thing here
p166
aVis hopefully very soon we will not have to
p167
aVrespond to these painful phone calls that we get
p168
aVafter disasters where we don't really have anything
p169
aVto sell or give you yet.
p170
aVHopefully very soon we will be there,
p171
aVbecause we are destined,
p172
aVobsessed with making it real.
p173
aVThank you. (Applause)

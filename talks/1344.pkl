VWhen I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old,
p5
aVwe were playing on top of a bunk bed.
p6
aVI was two years older than my sister at the time \u2014
p7
aVI mean, I'm two years older than her now \u2014
p8
aVbut at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do,
p9
aVand I wanted to play war.
p10
aVSo we were up on top of our bunk beds.
p11
aVAnd on one side of the bunk bed,
p12
aVI had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry.
p13
aVAnd on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies
p14
aVready for a cavalry charge.
p15
aa(lp16
VThere are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon,
p17
aVbut since my sister is not here with us today,
p18
aVlet me tell you the true story \u2014
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
Vwhich is my sister's a little on the clumsy side.
p23
aVSomehow, without any help or push from her older brother at all,
p24
aVAmy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed
p25
aVand landed with this crash on the floor.
p26
aVI nervously peered over the side of the bed
p27
aVto see what had befallen my fallen sister
p28
aVand saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees
p29
aVon all fours on the ground.
p30
aa(lp31
VI was nervous because my parents had charged me
p32
aVwith making sure that my sister and I
p33
aVplayed as safely and as quietly as possible.
p34
aVAnd seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm
p35
aVjust one week before \u2014
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter ends)
p40
aa(lp41
Vheroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet,
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aVfor which I have yet to be thanked, I was trying as hard as I could \u2014
p45
aVshe didn't even see it coming \u2014
p46
aVI was trying hard to be on my best behavior.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd I saw my sister's face,
p49
aVthis wail of pain and suffering and surprise
p50
aVthreatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents
p51
aVfrom the long winter's nap for which they had settled.
p52
aVSo I did the only thing
p53
aVmy frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy.
p54
aVAnd if you have children, you've seen this hundreds of times.
p55
aVI said, "Amy, wait. Don't cry. Did you see how you landed?
p56
aVNo human lands on all fours like that.
p57
aVAmy, I think this means you're a unicorn."
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, that was cheating,
p62
aVbecause there was nothing she would want more
p63
aVthan not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister,
p64
aVbut Amy the special unicorn.
p65
aVOf course, this option was open to her brain
p66
aVat no point in the past.
p67
aVAnd you could see how my poor, manipulated sister faced conflict,
p68
aVas her little brain attempted to devote resources
p69
aVto feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced,
p70
aVor contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn.
p71
aVAnd the latter won.
p72
aVInstead of crying or ceasing our play,
p73
aVinstead of waking my parents,
p74
aVwith all the negative consequences for me,
p75
aVa smile spread across her face
p76
aVand she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed
p77
aVwith all the grace of a baby unicorn \u2014
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
Vwith one broken leg.
p82
aa(lp83
VWhat we stumbled across
p84
aVat this tender age of just five and seven \u2014
p85
aVwe had no idea at the time \u2014
p86
aVwas was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution
p87
aVoccurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain.
p88
aVWe had stumbled across something called positive psychology,
p89
aVwhich is the reason I'm here today
p90
aVand the reason that I wake up every morning.
p91
aa(lp92
VWhen I started talking about this research
p93
aVoutside of academia, with companies and schools,
p94
aVthe first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph.
p95
aVThe first thing I want to do is start with a graph.
p96
aVThis graph looks boring,
p97
aVbut it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning.
p98
aVAnd this graph doesn't even mean anything; it's fake data.
p99
aVWhat we found is \u2014
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VIf I got this data studying you, I would be thrilled,
p104
aVbecause there's a trend there,
p105
aVand that means that I can get published,
p106
aVwhich is all that really matters.
p107
aVThere is one weird red dot above the curve,
p108
aVthere's one weirdo in the room \u2014
p109
aVI know who you are, I saw you earlier \u2014
p110
aVthat's no problem.
p111
aVThat's no problem, as most of you know, because I can just delete that dot.
p112
aVI can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error.
p113
aVAnd we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VSo one of the first things we teach people
p118
aVin economics, statistics, business and psychology courses
p119
aVis how, in a statistically valid way, do we eliminate the weirdos.
p120
aVHow do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit?
p121
aVWhich is fantastic if I'm trying to find out
p122
aVhow many Advil the average person should be taking \u2014 two.
p123
aa(lp124
VBut if I'm interested in your potential,
p125
aVor for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity,
p126
aVwe're creating the cult of the average with science.
p127
aVIf I asked a question like,
p128
aV"How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom?"
p129
aVscientists change the answer to
p130
aV"How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom?"
p131
aVand we tailor the class towards the average.
p132
aVIf you fall below the average,
p133
aVthen psychologists get thrilled,
p134
aVbecause that means you're depressed or have a disorder,
p135
aVor hopefully both.
p136
aVWe're hoping for both because our business model is,
p137
aVif you come into a therapy session with one problem,
p138
aVwe want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten,
p139
aVso you keep coming back.
p140
aVWe'll go back into your childhood if necessary,
p141
aVbut eventually we want to make you normal again.
p142
aVBut normal is merely average.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average,
p145
aVwe will remain merely average.
p146
aVThen instead of deleting those positive outliers,
p147
aVwhat I intentionally do is come into a population like this one
p148
aVand say, why?
p149
aVWhy are some of you high above the curve
p150
aVin terms of intellectual, athletic, musical ability,
p151
aVcreativity, energy levels,
p152
aVresiliency in the face of challenge, sense of humor?
p153
aVWhatever it is, instead of deleting you, what I want to do is study you.
p154
aVBecause maybe we can glean information,
p155
aVnot just how to move people up to the average,
p156
aVbut move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide.
p157
aa(lp158
VThe reason this graph is important to me
p159
aVis, on the news, the majority of the information is not positive.
p160
aVin fact it's negative.
p161
aVMost of it's about murder, corruption, diseases, natural disasters.
p162
aVAnd very quickly, my brain starts to think
p163
aVthat's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world.
p164
aVThis creates "the medical school syndrome."
p165
aVDuring the first year of medical training,
p166
aVas you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases,
p167
aVsuddenly you realize you have all of them.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VI have a brother in-law named Bobo, which is a whole other story.
p172
aVBobo married Amy the unicorn.
p173
aVBobo called me on the phone \u2014
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
Vfrom Yale Medical School,
p178
aVand Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy."
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VWhich, even at Yale, is extraordinarily rare.
p183
aVBut I had no idea how to console poor Bobo
p184
aVbecause he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VWe're finding it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us,
p189
aVbut the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.
p190
aVAnd if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness,
p191
aVwe can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time.
p192
aa(lp193
VI applied to Harvard on a dare.
p194
aVI didn't expect to get in, and my family had no money for college.
p195
aVWhen I got a military scholarship two weeks later, they let me go.
p196
aVSomething that wasn't even a possibility became a reality.
p197
aVI assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well,
p198
aVthat they'd be excited to be there.
p199
aVEven in a classroom full of people smarter than you,
p200
aVI felt you'd be happy just to be in that classroom.
p201
aVBut what I found is, while some people experience that,
p202
aVwhen I graduated after my four years
p203
aVand then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students \u2014
p204
aVHarvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VI was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years.
p209
aVAnd in my research and my teaching,
p210
aVI found that these students, no matter how happy they were
p211
aVwith their original success of getting into the school,
p212
aVtwo weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there,
p213
aVnor on their philosophy or physics,
p214
aVbut on the competition, the workload,
p215
aVthe hassles, stresses, complaints.
p216
aa(lp217
VWhen I first went in there, I walked into the freshmen dining hall,
p218
aVwhich is where my friends from Waco, Texas, which is where I grew up \u2014
p219
aVI know some of you know this.
p220
aVWhen they'd visit, they'd look around,
p221
aVand say, "This dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart's."
p222
aVIt does, because that was Hogwart's and that's Harvard.
p223
aVAnd when they see this,
p224
aVthey say, "Why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard?
p225
aVWhat does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about?"
p226
aa(lp227
VEmbedded within that question
p228
aVis the key to understanding the science of happiness.
p229
aVBecause what that question assumes
p230
aVis that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels,
p231
aVwhen in reality, if I know everything about your external world,
p232
aVI can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness.
p233
aV90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world,
p234
aVbut by the way your brain processes the world.
p235
aVAnd if we change it,
p236
aVif we change our formula for happiness and success,
p237
aVwe can change the way that we can then affect reality.
p238
aVWhat we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ,
p239
aV75 percent of job successes
p240
aVare predicted by your optimism levels, your social support
p241
aVand your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat.
p242
aa(lp243
VI talked to a New England boarding school, probably the most prestigious one,
p244
aVand they said, "We already know that.
p245
aVSo every year, instead of just teaching our students, we have a wellness week.
p246
aVAnd we're so excited. Monday night we have the world's leading expert
p247
aVwill speak about adolescent depression.
p248
aVTuesday night it's school violence and bullying.
p249
aVWednesday night is eating disorders.
p250
aVThursday night is illicit drug use.
p251
aVAnd Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness."
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VI said, "That's most people's Friday nights."
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
V(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VWhich I'm glad you liked, but they did not like that at all.
p262
aVSilence on the phone.
p263
aVAnd into the silence, I said, "I'd be happy to speak at your school,
p264
aVbut that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week.
p265
aVYou've outlined all the negative things that can happen,
p266
aVbut not talked about the positive."
p267
aa(lp268
VThe absence of disease is not health.
p269
aVHere's how we get to health:
p270
aVWe need to reverse the formula for happiness and success.
p271
aVIn the last three years, I've traveled to 45 countries,
p272
aVworking with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn.
p273
aVAnd I found that most companies and schools
p274
aVfollow a formula for success, which is this:
p275
aVIf I work harder, I'll be more successful.
p276
aVAnd if I'm more successful, then I'll be happier.
p277
aVThat undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles,
p278
aVthe way that we motivate our behavior.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons.
p281
aVEvery time your brain has a success,
p282
aVyou just changed the goalpost of what success looked like.
p283
aVYou got good grades, now you have to get better grades,
p284
aVyou got into a good school and after you get into a better one,
p285
aVyou got a good job, now you have to get a better job,
p286
aVyou hit your sales target, we're going to change it.
p287
aVAnd if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there.
p288
aVWe've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon, as a society.
p289
aVAnd that's because we think we have to be successful,
p290
aVthen we'll be happier.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut our brains work in the opposite order.
p293
aVIf you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present,
p294
aVthen their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage,
p295
aVwhich is your brain at positive performs significantly better
p296
aVthan at negative, neutral or stressed.
p297
aVYour intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise.
p298
aVIn fact, we've found that every single business outcome improves.
p299
aVYour brain at positive is 31% more productive
p300
aVthan your brain at negative, neutral or stressed.
p301
aVYou're 37% better at sales.
p302
aVDoctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate
p303
aVat coming up with the correct diagnosis
p304
aVwhen positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed.
p305
aa(lp306
VWhich means we can reverse the formula.
p307
aVIf we can find a way of becoming positive in the present,
p308
aVthen our brains work even more successfully
p309
aVas we're able to work harder, faster and more intelligently.
p310
aVWe need to be able to reverse this formula
p311
aVso we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of.
p312
aVBecause dopamine, which floods into your system when you're positive,
p313
aVhas two functions.
p314
aVNot only does it make you happier,
p315
aVit turns on all of the learning centers in your brain
p316
aVallowing you to adapt to the world in a different way.
p317
aa(lp318
VWe've found there are ways that you can train your brain
p319
aVto be able to become more positive.
p320
aVIn just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row,
p321
aVwe can actually rewire your brain,
p322
aVallowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully.
p323
aVWe've done these things in research now
p324
aVin every company that I've worked with,
p325
aVgetting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for
p326
aVfor 21 days in a row, three new things each day.
p327
aVAnd at the end of that,
p328
aVtheir brain starts to retain a pattern
p329
aVof scanning the world not for the negative, but for the positive first.
p330
aa(lp331
VJournaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours
p332
aVallows your brain to relive it.
p333
aVExercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters.
p334
aVWe find that meditation allows your brain
p335
aVto get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating
p336
aVby trying to do multiple tasks at once
p337
aVand allows our brains to focus on the task at hand.
p338
aVAnd finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness.
p339
aVWe get people, when they open up their inbox,
p340
aVto write one positive email
p341
aVpraising or thanking somebody in their support network.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd by doing these activities
p344
aVand by training your brain just like we train our bodies,
p345
aVwhat we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success,
p346
aVand in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity,
p347
aVbut a real revolution.
p348
aa(lp349
VThank you very much.

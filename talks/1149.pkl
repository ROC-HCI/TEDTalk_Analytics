VSo I want to take you on a trip
p5
aVto an alien world.
p6
aVAnd it's not a trip
p7
aVthat requires light-years of travel,
p8
aVbut it's to a place
p9
aVwhere it's defined by light.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo it's a little-appreciated fact
p12
aVthat most of the animals in our ocean
p13
aVmake light.
p14
aVI've spent most of my career
p15
aVstudying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.
p16
aVI study it because I think understanding it
p17
aVis critical to understanding life in the ocean
p18
aVwhere most bioluminescence occurs.
p19
aVI also use it as a tool
p20
aVfor visualizing and tracking pollution.
p21
aVBut mostly I'm entranced by it.
p22
aVSince my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible,
p23
aVwhen I went down and turned out the lights
p24
aVand saw the fireworks displays,
p25
aVI've been a bioluminescence junky.
p26
aVBut I would come back from those dives
p27
aVand try to share the experience with words,
p28
aVand they were totally inadequate to the task.
p29
aVI needed some way to share the experience directly.
p30
aVAnd the first time I figured out that way
p31
aVwas in this little single-person submersible
p32
aVcalled Deep Rover.
p33
aa(lp34
VThis next video clip,
p35
aVyou're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence.
p36
aVAnd the first thing you're going to see
p37
aVis a transect screen
p38
aVthat is about a meter across.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Video) Narrator: In front of the sub,
p41
aVa mess screen will come into contact
p42
aVwith the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea.
p43
aVWith the sub's lights switched off,
p44
aVit is possible to see their bioluminescence \u2014
p45
aVthe light produced when they collide with the mesh.
p46
aVThis is the first time
p47
aVit has ever been recorded.
p48
aa(lp49
VEdith Widder: So I recorded that with an intensified video camera
p50
aVthat has about the sensitivity
p51
aVof the fully dark-adapted human eye.
p52
aVWhich means that really is what you would see
p53
aVif you took a dive in a submersible.
p54
aVBut just to try to prove that fact to you,
p55
aVI've brought along some bioluminescent plankton
p56
aVin what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt
p57
aVat a live demonstration.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VSo, if we could have the lights down
p62
aVand have it as dark in here as possible,
p63
aVI have a flask
p64
aVthat has bioluminescent plankton in it.
p65
aVAnd you'll note there's no light coming from them right now,
p66
aVeither because they're dead \u2014
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aVor because I need to stir them up in some way
p69
aVfor you to see what bioluminescence really looks like.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Gasps)
p72
aa(lp73
VOops. Sorry.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VI spend most of my time working in the dark; I'm used to that.
p78
aVOkay.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo that light
p81
aVwas made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate,
p82
aVa single-celled alga.
p83
aVSo why would a single-celled alga
p84
aVneed to be able to produce light?
p85
aVWell, it uses it to defend itself from its predators.
p86
aVThe flash is like a scream for help.
p87
aVIt's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm,
p88
aVand just like the alarm on your car or your house,
p89
aVit's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder,
p90
aVthereby either leading to his capture
p91
aVor scaring him away.
p92
aa(lp93
VThere's a lot of animals that use this trick,
p94
aVfor example this black dragonfish.
p95
aVIt's got a light organ under its eye.
p96
aVIt's got a chin barbel.
p97
aVIt's got a lot of other light organs you can't see, but you'll see in here in a minute.
p98
aVSo we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime,
p99
aVbecause the top speed of this fish is one knot,
p100
aVwhich was the top speed of the submersible.
p101
aVBut it was worth it,
p102
aVbecause we caught it in a special capture device,
p103
aVbrought it up into the lab on the ship,
p104
aVand then everything on this fish lights up.
p105
aVIt's unbelievable.
p106
aVThe light organs under the eyes are flashing.
p107
aVThat chin barbel is flashing.
p108
aVIt's got light organs on its belly that are flashing,
p109
aVfin lights.
p110
aVIt's a scream for help; it's meant to attract attention.
p111
aVIt's phenomenal.
p112
aVAnd you normally don't get to see this
p113
aVbecause we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets.
p114
aa(lp115
VThere's other ways you can defend yourself with light.
p116
aVFor example, this shrimp
p117
aVreleases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water
p118
aVjust the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud.
p119
aVThis blinds or distracts the predator.
p120
aVThis little squid is called the fire shooter
p121
aVbecause of its ability to do this.
p122
aVNow it may look like a tasty morsel,
p123
aVor a pig's head with wings \u2014
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVbut if it's attacked,
p126
aVit puts out a barrage of light \u2014
p127
aVin fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes.
p128
aVI just barely got the lights out in time
p129
aVfor you to be able to see those gobs of light
p130
aVhitting the transect screen
p131
aVand then just glowing.
p132
aVIt's phenomenal.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo there's a lot of animals in the open ocean \u2014
p135
aVmost of them that make light.
p136
aVAnd we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why.
p137
aVThey use it for finding food, for attracting mates,
p138
aVfor defending against predators.
p139
aVBut when you get down to the bottom of the ocean,
p140
aVthat's where things get really strange.
p141
aVAnd some of these animals
p142
aVare probably inspiration for the things you saw in "Avatar,"
p143
aVbut you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them.
p144
aVThey're things like this.
p145
aa(lp146
VThis is a golden coral, a bush.
p147
aVIt grows very slowly.
p148
aVIn fact, it's thought that some of these
p149
aVare as much as 3,000 years old,
p150
aVwhich is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed.
p151
aVThe other reason is this amazing bush glows.
p152
aVSo if you brush up against it,
p153
aVany place you brushed against it,
p154
aVyou get this twinkling blue-green light
p155
aVthat's just breathtaking.
p156
aVAnd you see things like this.
p157
aVThis looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book \u2014
p158
aVjust all manner of creatures all over this thing.
p159
aVAnd these are flytrap anemones.
p160
aVNow if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles.
p161
aVBut if you keep poking it,
p162
aVit starts to produce light.
p163
aVAnd it actually ends up looking like a galaxy.
p164
aVIt produces these strings of light,
p165
aVpresumably as some form of defense.
p166
aa(lp167
VThere are starfish that can make light.
p168
aVAnd there are brittle stars that produce bands of light
p169
aVthat dance along their arms.
p170
aVThis looks like a plant,
p171
aVbut it's actually an animal.
p172
aVAnd it anchors itself in the sand
p173
aVby blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock.
p174
aVSo it can actually hold itself in very strong currents,
p175
aVas you see here.
p176
aVBut if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab
p177
aVand just squeeze it at the base of the stock,
p178
aVit produces this light
p179
aVthat propagates from stem to the plume,
p180
aVchanging color as it goes,
p181
aVfrom green to blue.
p182
aVColorization and sound effects
p183
aVadded for you viewing pleasure.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aVBut we have no idea why it does that.
p186
aa(lp187
VHere's another one. This is also a sea pen.
p188
aVIt's got a brittle star hitching a ride.
p189
aVIt's a green saber of light.
p190
aVAnd like the one you just saw,
p191
aVit can produce these as bands of light.
p192
aVSo if I squeeze the base,
p193
aVthe bands go from base to tip.
p194
aVIf I squeeze the tip, they go from tip to base.
p195
aVSo what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle?
p196
aV(Gasps)
p197
aVI'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VSo there's a language of light in the deep ocean,
p202
aVand we're just beginning to understand it,
p203
aVand one way we're going about that
p204
aVis we're imitating a lot of these displays.
p205
aVThis is an optical lure that I've used.
p206
aVWe call it the electronic jellyfish.
p207
aVIt's just 16 blue LEDs
p208
aVthat we can program to do different types of displays.
p209
aVAnd we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea
p210
aVthat uses far red light that's invisible to most animals,
p211
aVso it's unobtrusive.
p212
aVSo I just want to show you
p213
aVsome of the responses we've elicited
p214
aVfrom animals in the deep sea.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo the camera's black and white.
p217
aVIt's not high-resolution.
p218
aVAnd what you're seeing here is a bait box
p219
aVwith a bunch of \u2014 like the cockroaches of the ocean \u2014
p220
aVthere are isopods all over it.
p221
aVAnd right in the front
p222
aVis the electronic jellyfish.
p223
aVAnd when it starts flashing,
p224
aVit's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast.
p225
aVBut as soon as it starts to flash \u2014
p226
aVand it's going to look big, because it blooms on the camera \u2014
p227
aVI want you to look right here.
p228
aVThere's something small there that responds.
p229
aVWe're talking to something.
p230
aVIt looks like a little of string pearls basically \u2014
p231
aVin fact, three strings of pearls.
p232
aVAnd this was very consistent.
p233
aVThis was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet.
p234
aVWe basically have a chat room going on here,
p235
aVbecause once it gets started, everybody's talking.
p236
aVAnd I think this is actually a shrimp
p237
aVthat's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water.
p238
aVBut the cool thing is, we're talking to it.
p239
aVWe don't know what we're saying.
p240
aVPersonally, I think it's something sexy.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd then finally,
p245
aVI want to show you some responses that we recorded
p246
aVwith the world's first deep-sea webcam,
p247
aVwhich we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year.
p248
aVWe've only just begun to analyze all of this data.
p249
aVThis is going to be a glowing source first,
p250
aVwhich is like bioluminescent bacteria.
p251
aVAnd it is an optical cue
p252
aVthat there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean.
p253
aVSo this scavenger comes in,
p254
aVwhich is a giant sixgill shark.
p255
aVAnd I can't claim for sure
p256
aVthat the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there.
p257
aVBut if it had been following the odor plume,
p258
aVit would have come in from the other direction.
p259
aVAnd it does actually seem to be trying
p260
aVto eat the electronic jellyfish.
p261
aVThat's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark.
p262
aa(lp263
VOkay, so this next one is from the webcam,
p264
aVand it's going to be this pinwheel display.
p265
aVAnd this is a burglar alarm.
p266
aVAnd that was a Humboldt squid,
p267
aVa juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long.
p268
aVThis is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon.
p269
aVBut if it's a burglar alarm, you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly.
p270
aVIt's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish.
p271
aVBut we did see a bunch of responses like this.
p272
aVThis guy is a little more contemplative.
p273
aV"Hey, wait a minute.
p274
aVThere's supposed to be something else there."
p275
aVHe's thinking about it.
p276
aVBut he's persistent.
p277
aVHe keeps coming back.
p278
aVAnd then he goes away for a few seconds
p279
aVto think about it some more,
p280
aVand thinks,
p281
aV"Maybe if I come in from a different angle."
p282
aV(Laughter)
p283
aVNope.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo we are starting to get a handle on this,
p286
aVbut only just the beginnings.
p287
aVWe need more eyes on the process.
p288
aVSo if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible,
p289
aVby all means, climb in and take the plunge.
p290
aVThis is something that should be on everybody's bucket list,
p291
aVbecause we live on an ocean planet.
p292
aVMore than 90 percent, 99 percent,
p293
aVof the living space on our planet
p294
aVis ocean.
p295
aVIt's a magical place
p296
aVfilled with breathtaking light shows
p297
aVand bizarre and wondrous creatures,
p298
aValien life forms
p299
aVthat you don't have to travel to another planet to see.
p300
aa(lp301
VBut if you do take the plunge,
p302
aVplease remember to turn out the lights.
p303
aVBut I warn you,
p304
aVit's addictive.
p305
aa(lp306
VThank you.

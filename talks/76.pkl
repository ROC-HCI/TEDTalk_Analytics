VI work with a species called "Bonobo."
p5
aVAnd I'm happy most of the time,
p6
aVbecause I think this is the happiest species on the planet.
p7
aVIt's kind of a well-kept secret.
p8
aVThis species lives only in the Congo.
p9
aVAnd they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.
p10
aVTheir sexual behavior is too human-like
p11
aVfor most of us to be comfortable with.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VBut \u2014
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
Vactually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very
p20
aVegalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.
p21
aVAnd sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life
p22
aVthat they sort of set aside.
p23
aVIt permeates their entire life.
p24
aVAnd it's used for communication.
p25
aVAnd it's used for conflict resolution.
p26
aVAnd I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of,
p27
aVdivided our lives up into lots of parts.
p28
aVWe divided our world up with lots of categories.
p29
aVAnd so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.
p30
aVBut I don't think that we were that way initially.
p31
aa(lp32
VThere are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired
p33
aVand that there's something very, very special about man.
p34
aVMaybe it's his ability to have causal thought.
p35
aVMaybe it's something special in his brain
p36
aVthat allows him to have language.
p37
aVMaybe it's something special in his brain
p38
aVthat allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.
p39
aVWell, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered
p40
aVaround the 1600s and they had no fire.
p41
aVThey had no stone tools.
p42
aVTo our knowledge they had no music.
p43
aVSo when you compare them to the Bonobo,
p44
aVthe Bonobo is a little hairier.
p45
aVHe doesn't stand quite as upright.
p46
aVBut there are a lot of similarities.
p47
aVAnd I think that as we look at culture,
p48
aVwe kind of come to understand
p49
aVhow we got to where we are.
p50
aVAnd I don't really think it's in our biology;
p51
aVI think we've attributed it to our biology,
p52
aVbut I don't really think it's there.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo what I want to do now is introduce you
p55
aVto a species called the Bonobo.
p56
aVThis is Kanzi.
p57
aVHe's a Bonobo.
p58
aVRight now, he's in a forest in Georgia.
p59
aVHis mother originally came from a forest in Africa.
p60
aVAnd she came to us when she was just at puberty,
p61
aVabout six or seven years of age.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow this shows a Bonobo on your right,
p64
aVand a chimpanzee on your left.
p65
aVClearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.
p66
aVThe Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer,
p67
aVis more upright, just as we are.
p68
aVThis shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.
p69
aVAs you can see, there's not a lot of difference
p70
aVbetween the way a Bonobo walks
p71
aVand the way an early australopithecine would have walked.
p72
aVAs they turn toward us you'll see
p73
aVthat the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter
p74
aVand doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.
p75
aVSo the \u2014 the bipedal gait is a little easier.
p76
aVAnd now we see all four.
p77
aa(lp78
VVideo: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle
p79
aVencircled by the Congo River.
p80
aVCanopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet,
p81
aVgrow densely in the area.
p82
aVIt was a Japanese scientist
p83
aVwho first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo,
p84
aValmost three decades ago.
p85
aVBonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.
p86
aVSlim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.
p87
aVLong and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.
p88
aVOne discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.
p89
aVWhat's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.
p90
aVSusan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame.
p91
aa(lp92
VSS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.
p93
aVNone of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.
p94
aVNone of them are tricks.
p95
aVThey all happened to be captured on film spontaneously,
p96
aVby NHK of Japan.
p97
aVWe have eight Bonobos.
p98
aa(lp99
VVideo: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire.
p100
aa(lp101
VSS: An entire family at our research centre.
p102
aa(lp103
VVideo: You going to help get some sticks?
p104
aVGood.
p105
aVWe need more sticks, too.
p106
aVI have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.
p107
aVThat's a wasps' nest.
p108
aVYou can get it out.
p109
aVI hope I have a lighter.
p110
aVYou can use the lighter to start the fire.
p111
aa(lp112
VSS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.
p113
aVHe doesn't do it yet without a lighter,
p114
aVbut I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do \u2014
p115
aVmake a fire without a lighter.
p116
aVHe's learning about how to keep a fire going.
p117
aVHe's learning the uses for a fire,
p118
aVjust by watching what we do with fire.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VThis is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.
p123
aVThese are happy vocalizations.
p124
aa(lp125
VVideo: You're happy.
p126
aVYou're very happy about this part.
p127
aVYou've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water?
p128
aVGood job.
p129
aa(lp130
VSS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.
p131
aVBut he likes to carry things from place to place.
p132
aa(lp133
VVideo: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin."
p134
aa(lp135
VSS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance,
p136
aVfarther than we can hear.
p137
aVThis is his sister.
p138
aVThis is her first time to try to drive a golf cart.
p139
aa(lp140
VVideo: Goodbye.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VSS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.
p145
aVShe switches from reverse to forward
p146
aVand she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VLike us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Music)
p153
aa(lp154
VVideo: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human,
p155
aVand documenting their development across two decades,
p156
aVscientists are exploring how cultural forces
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
Vmay have operated during human evolution.
p161
aa(lp162
VHis name is Nyota.
p163
aVIt means "star" in Swahili.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Music)
p166
aa(lp167
VPanbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.
p168
aVIn the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.
p169
aVHere Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands,
p170
aVto groom Nyota.
p171
aVVery impressive.
p172
aVSubtle maneuvering of the hands is required
p173
aVto perform delicate tasks like this.
p174
aVNyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.
p175
aVRealizing that Nyota might get hurt,
p176
aVPanbanisha, like any human mother,
p177
aVcarefully tugs to get the scissors back.
p178
aa(lp179
VHe can now cut through tough animal hide.
p180
aa(lp181
VSS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.
p182
aa(lp183
VVideo: Kanzi now makes his tools,
p184
aVjust as our ancestors may have made them,
p185
aVtwo-and-a-half million years ago \u2014
p186
aVby holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.
p187
aVHe has learned that by using both hands
p188
aVand aiming his glancing blows,
p189
aVhe can make much larger, sharper flakes.
p190
aVKanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.
p191
aVThe tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.
p192
aVThe rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard
p193
aVand ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle,
p194
aVrequiring great skill.
p195
aVKanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia
p196
aVand is identical to that used by our African ancestors
p197
aVtwo-and-a-half million years ago.
p198
aVThese are the rocks Kanzi used
p199
aVand these are the flakes he made.
p200
aVThe flat sharp edges are like knife blades.
p201
aVCompare them to the tools our ancestors used;
p202
aVthey bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.
p203
aa(lp204
VPanbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.
p205
aVShe keeps staring out the window.
p206
aa(lp207
VSS: This is \u2014 let me show you something we didn't think they would do.
p208
aa(lp209
VVideo: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside.
p210
aa(lp211
VSS: I normally talk about language.
p212
aa(lp213
VVideo: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.
p214
aa(lp215
VSS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do,
p216
aVI haven't told you that these apes have language.
p217
aVIt's a geometric language.
p218
aa(lp219
VVideo: She takes a piece of chalk
p220
aVand begins writing something on the floor.
p221
aVWhat is she writing?
p222
aa(lp223
VSS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice.
p224
aa(lp225
VVideo: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.
p226
aa(lp227
VSS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Music)
p230
aa(lp231
VThey speak when she touches them.
p232
aa(lp233
VVideo: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.
p234
aV"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.
p235
aVCompare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.
p236
aVPanbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.
p237
aVSS (video): Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.
p238
aa(lp239
VSS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing,
p240
aVuntil we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.
p241
aa(lp242
VVideo: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.
p243
aVThe curved line is very similar to the lexigram.
p244
aVThe next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar."
p245
aVIt indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.
p246
aa(lp247
VSS: That's an institutional requirement.
p248
aa(lp249
VVideo: This symbol is not as clear as the others,
p250
aVbut one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line
p251
aVand several straight lines.
p252
aVResearchers began to record what Panbanisha said,
p253
aVby writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.
p254
aVPanbanisha watched.
p255
aVSoon she began to write as well.
p256
aVThe Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.
p257
aVHow did they develop?
p258
aa(lp259
VSS (video): We found that the most important thing
p260
aVfor permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.
p261
aVIt's simply to use language around them,
p262
aVbecause the driving force in language acquisition
p263
aVis to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.
p264
aVOnce you have that capacity,
p265
aVthe ability to produce language
p266
aVcomes rather naturally and rather freely.
p267
aVSo we want to create an environment in which Bonobos,
p268
aVlike all of the individuals with whom they are interacting \u2014
p269
aVwe want to create an environment in which they have fun,
p270
aVand an environment in which the others
p271
aVare meaningful individuals for them.
p272
aVNarrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential
p273
aVin Kanzi and Panbanisha.
p274
aa(lp275
VPanbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica,
p276
aVuntil Nyota, now one year old, steals it.
p277
aVThen he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.
p278
aVIs he looking for where the sound came from?
p279
aVDr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.
p280
aVThis time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.
p281
aVShe wasn't forced to learn the piano;
p282
aVshe saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.
p283
aa(lp284
VResearcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening.
p285
aVDo that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.
p286
aa(lp287
VNarrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone;
p288
aVusing both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.
p289
aVKanzi and Panbanisha
p290
aVare stimulated by this fun-filled environment,
p291
aVwhich promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VResearcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them.
p296
aVTake the cherries too.
p297
aVNow watch out, stay away from them now.
p298
aVNow you can chase them again. Time to chase them.
p299
aVNow you have to stay away. Get away.
p300
aVRun away. Run.
p301
aVNow we can chase them again. Go get them.
p302
aVOh no!
p303
aVGood Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.
p304
aa(lp305
VNarrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine?
p306
aa(lp307
VSS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture."
p308
aVWe're learning how to become like them.
p309
aVWe're learning how to communicate with them,
p310
aVin really high-pitched tones.
p311
aVWe're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.
p312
aVAnd they're learning to become like us.
p313
aVBecause we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.
p314
aVSo we're sharing tools and technology and language
p315
aVwith another species.
p316
aa(lp317
VThank you.

debate over intelligence and instinct -- over what makes us human -- Susan Savage-Rumbaugh has thrown a monkey wrench. Her work with apes has forced <strong>a new way of looking at what traits are truly and distinctly human</strong>, and new questions about whether some abilities we attribute to &quot;species&quot; are in fact due to an animal&#39;s social environment. She believes culture and tradition, in many cases more than biology, can account for differences between humans and other primates. </p><p>Her bonobo apes, including a superstar named Kanzi, understand spoken English, interact, and have learned to execute tasks once believed limited to humans -- such as starting and controlling a fire. They aren&#39;t trained in classic human-animal fashion. <strong>Like human children, the apes learn by watching.</strong> &quot;Parents really don&#39;t know how they teach their children language,&quot; she has said. &quot;Why should I have to know how I teach Kanzi language?

VJambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages
p5
aVthat I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks,
p6
aVas I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing,
p7
aVchecking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.
p8
aVAnd I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.
p9
aVAnd visiting some pretty incredible places,
p10
aVplaces like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice \u2014
p11
aVI was here a month ago.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that
p14
aVis utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.
p15
aVYou see some incredible stuff.
p16
aVAnd you get to make these spot comparisons
p17
aVbetween people all around the globe.
p18
aVAnd the thing that you really take away from that,
p19
aVthe kind of surface thing that you take away from it,
p20
aVis not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that,
p21
aVbut rather how different we are.
p22
aVThere is so much diversity around the globe.
p23
aV6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people,
p24
aVall different colors, shapes, sizes.
p25
aVYou walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that,
p26
aVand you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.
p27
aa(lp28
VHow do we explain that diversity?
p29
aVWell, that's what I'm going to talk about today,
p30
aVis how we're using the tools of genetics,
p31
aVpopulation genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity,
p32
aVand how long it took.
p33
aVNow, the problem of human diversity,
p34
aVlike all big scientific questions \u2014
p35
aVhow do you explain something like that \u2014
p36
aVcan be broken down into sub-questions.
p37
aVAnd you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.
p38
aa(lp39
VFirst one is really a question of origins.
p40
aVDo we all share a common origin, in fact?
p41
aVAnd given that we do \u2014 and that's the assumption
p42
aVeverybody, I think, in this room would make \u2014 when was that?
p43
aVWhen did we originate as a species?
p44
aVHow long have we been divergent from each other?
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd the second question is related, but slightly different.
p47
aVIf we do spring from a common source,
p48
aVhow did we come to occupy every corner of the globe,
p49
aVand in the process generate all of this diversity,
p50
aVthe different ways of life, the different appearances,
p51
aVthe different languages around the world?
p52
aa(lp53
VWell, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology,
p54
aVseems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.
p55
aVIn "The Descent of Man," he wrote,
p56
aV"In each great region of the world, the living mammals
p57
aVare closely related to the extinct species of the same region.
p58
aVIt's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes
p59
aVclosely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee,
p60
aVand as these two species are now man's nearest allies,
p61
aVit's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors
p62
aVlived on the African continent than elsewhere."
p63
aa(lp64
VSo we're done, we can go home \u2014 finished the origin question.
p65
aVWell, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,
p66
aVour common ancestry with apes.
p67
aVAnd it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.
p68
aVAround 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.
p69
aVAfrica was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,
p70
aVdue to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.
p71
aVBumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,
p72
aVand then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.
p73
aVThe apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,
p74
aVbecame the gibbons and the orangutans.
p75
aVAnd the ones that stayed on in Africa
p76
aVevolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.
p77
aVSo, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes,
p78
aVit's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut that's not really the question I'm asking.
p81
aVI'm asking about our human ancestry,
p82
aVthings that we would recognize as being like us
p83
aVif they were sitting here in the room.
p84
aVIf they were peering over your shoulder,
p85
aVyou wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?
p86
aVBecause if we go far enough back,
p87
aVwe share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.
p88
aVDNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda
p89
aVand bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back \u2014 over a billion years.
p90
aVWhat we're asking about though is human ancestry.
p91
aVHow do we study that?
p92
aa(lp93
VWell, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.
p94
aVDigging things up out of the ground,
p95
aVand largely on the basis of morphology \u2014
p96
aVthe way things are shaped, often skull shape \u2014 saying,
p97
aV"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.
p98
aVThis must be who I'm directly descended from."
p99
aa(lp100
VThe field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue,
p101
aVgives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry,
p102
aVbut it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.
p103
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p104
aVYou're looking at a great example here.
p105
aVThese are three extinct species of hominids,
p106
aVpotential human ancestors.
p107
aVAll dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.
p108
aVAnd they're all dating to roughly the same time.
p109
aVFrom left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis,
p110
aVand Australopithecus \u2014 now called Paranthropus boisei,
p111
aVthe robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.
p112
aVThat means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.
p113
aVWhich one of these guys am I actually related to?
p114
aVPossibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.
p115
aa(lp116
VWell, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans
p117
aVusing the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently \u2014
p118
aVagain, largely skull shape.
p119
aVThe first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,
p120
aVCarl von Linne, a Swedish botanist,
p121
aVwho in the eighteenth century took it upon himself
p122
aVto categorize every living organism on the planet.
p123
aVYou think you've got a tough job?
p124
aVAnd he did a pretty good job.
p125
aVHe categorized about 12,000 species in "Systema Naturae."
p126
aVHe actually coined the term Homo sapiens \u2014 it means wise man in Latin.
p127
aVBut looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,
p128
aV"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories."
p129
aVAnd he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,
p130
aVand a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus,"
p131
aVwhich basically included all the people he didn't like,
p132
aVincluding imaginary folk like elves.
p133
aa(lp134
VIt's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned
p135
aVbut ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist
p136
aVworking in the pre-Darwinian era.
p137
aVExcept, if you had taken physical anthropology
p138
aVas recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned
p139
aVbasically that same classification of humanity.
p140
aVHuman races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago \u2014
p141
aVCarlton Coon is the best example \u2014
p142
aVhad been diverging from each other \u2014 this was in the post-Darwinian era \u2014
p143
aVfor over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.
p144
aVBut based on what data?
p145
aVVery little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.
p146
aa(lp147
VWell, what I'm going to talk about today,
p148
aVwhat I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.
p149
aVInstead of going out and guessing about our ancestry,
p150
aVdigging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors,
p151
aVand saying it on the basis of morphology \u2014
p152
aVwhich we still don't completely understand,
p153
aVwe don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation \u2014
p154
aa(lp155
Vwhat we need to do is turn the problem on its head.
p156
aVBecause what we're really asking is a genealogical problem,
p157
aVor a genealogical question.
p158
aVWhat we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
p159
aVAnd as any genealogist will tell you \u2014
p160
aVanybody have a member of the family, or maybe you
p161
aVhave tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?
p162
aVYou start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.
p163
aVYou and your siblings, you have a parent in common.
p164
aVYou and your cousins share a grandparent in common.
p165
aVYou gradually trace further and further back into the past,
p166
aVadding these ever more distant relationships.
p167
aVBut eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records,
p168
aVand all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.
p169
aVA point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors,
p170
aVand you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history
p171
aVthat we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.
p172
aa(lp173
VWho were these people who came before?
p174
aVWe have no written record. Well, actually, we do.
p175
aVWritten in our DNA, in our genetic code \u2014
p176
aVwe have a historical document that takes us back in time
p177
aVto the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.
p178
aa(lp179
VNow, a quick primer on DNA.
p180
aVI suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.
p181
aVIt is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version
p182
aVof how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.
p183
aVIt's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.
p184
aVAnd it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.
p185
aVHow long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.
p186
aVA haploid genome \u2014 we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes \u2014
p187
aVa haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.
p188
aVAnd the whole thing, if you add it all together,
p189
aVis over six billion nucleotides long.
p190
aVIf you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,
p191
aVand stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.
p192
aVIf you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,
p193
aVand you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back,
p194
aVthousands of times. It's a lot of information.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.
p197
aVImagine the longest book you can think of, "War and Peace."
p198
aVNow multiply it by 100.
p199
aVAnd imagine copying that by hand.
p200
aVAnd you're working away until late at night,
p201
aVand you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee
p202
aVand you're paying attention, but, occasionally,
p203
aVwhen you're copying this by hand,
p204
aVyou're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake \u2014
p205
aVsubstitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.
p206
aa(lp207
VSame thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.
p208
aVIt doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.
p209
aVBut when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down
p210
aVthrough the generations, they become markers of descent.
p211
aVIf you share a marker with someone,
p212
aVit means you share an ancestor at some point in the past,
p213
aVthe person who first had that change in their DNA.
p214
aVAnd it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation,
p215
aVthe pattern of these markers in people all over the world,
p216
aVand assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history,
p217
aVthat we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
p218
aa(lp219
VThese are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.
p220
aVMitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.
p221
aVYou get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother,
p222
aVall the way back to the very first woman.
p223
aVThe Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men,
p224
aVtraces a purely paternal line of descent.
p225
aVEverybody in this room, everybody in the world,
p226
aVfalls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.
p227
aVNow, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees,
p228
aVthey're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.
p229
aVTurn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree
p230
aVwith the root at the bottom and the branches going up.
p231
aVWhat's the take-home message?
p232
aa(lp233
VWell, the thing that jumps out at you first
p234
aVis that the deepest lineages in our family trees
p235
aVare found within Africa, among Africans.
p236
aVThat means that Africans have been accumulating
p237
aVthis mutational diversity for longer.
p238
aVAnd what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.
p239
aVEvery piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.
p240
aVAnd at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans
p241
aVleft the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow, how recently do we share this ancestry?
p244
aVWas it millions of years ago, which we might suspect
p245
aVby looking at all this incredible variation around the world?
p246
aVNo, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.
p247
aVWithin the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person \u2014
p248
aVMitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her \u2014 in Africa,
p249
aVan African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut what's even more amazing
p252
aVis that if you look at the Y-chromosome side,
p253
aVthe male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam
p254
aVonly lived around 60,000 years ago.
p255
aVThat's only about 2,000 human generations,
p256
aVthe blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.
p257
aVThat tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.
p258
aVThis was an African man who gave rise
p259
aVto all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.
p260
aVIt's only within the last 60,000 years
p261
aVthat we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.
p262
aVSuch an amazing story.
p263
aVWe're all effectively part of an extended African family.
p264
aa(lp265
VNow, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?
p266
aVWhy didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species,
p267
aVor sub-species rather, human races around the world?
p268
aVWhy was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?
p269
aVWell, that's a big question. These "why" questions,
p270
aVparticularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones,
p271
aVthe ones that are tough to answer.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd so when all else fails, talk about the weather.
p274
aVWhat was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?
p275
aVWell, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.
p276
aVThe last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.
p277
aVIt went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.
p278
aVLots of evidence from sediment cores
p279
aVand the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.
p280
aVWe hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago,
p281
aVbut basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough,
p282
aVgetting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.
p283
aVNew York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.
p284
aVMost of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.
p285
aa(lp286
VNow, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet \u2014
p287
aVabout 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn \u2014
p288
aVand there aren't a lot of glaciers here,
p289
aVexcept on the high mountains here in East Africa.
p290
aVSo what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.
p291
aVRather, Africa was drying out at that time.
p292
aVThis is a paleo-climatological map
p293
aVof what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,
p294
aVreconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.
p295
aVThe reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.
p296
aVIf you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo the whole world was drying out.
p299
aVThe sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.
p300
aVThe Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.
p301
aVAnd the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets,
p302
aVcompared to what we have today.
p303
aVThe evidence from genetic data
p304
aVis that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago,
p305
aVcrashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.
p306
aVWe nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd then something happened. A great illustration of it.
p309
aVLook at some stone tools.
p310
aVThe ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.
p311
aVThe ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins,
p312
aVnot our direct ancestors, living in Europe,
p313
aVand they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.
p314
aVNow, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists
p315
aVor physical anthropologists in the audience,
p316
aVbasically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.
p317
aVThe ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.
p318
aVWe are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago
p319
aVuntil around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.
p320
aVThe tool styles don't change that much.
p321
aVThe evidence is that the human way of life
p322
aVdidn't change that much during that period.
p323
aa(lp324
VBut then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region,
p325
aVall hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.
p326
aVThe stone tools become much more finely crafted.
p327
aVThe evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species,
p328
aVat particular times of the year.
p329
aVThe population size started to expand.
p330
aVProbably, according to what many linguists believe,
p331
aVfully modern language, syntactic language \u2014 subject, verb, object \u2014
p332
aVthat we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.
p333
aVWe became much more social. The social networks expanded.
p334
aa(lp335
VThis change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa,
p336
aVand they allowed us to start to expand around the world.
p337
aVWe've been talking at this conference about African success stories.
p338
aVWell, you want the ultimate African success story?
p339
aVLook in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today
p340
aVis because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa \u2014
p341
aVprobably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now,
p342
aVaround 60, 70 thousand years ago \u2014
p343
aVallowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.
p344
aVAn early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia,
p345
aVleaving Africa around 60,000 years ago,
p346
aVreaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.
p347
aVA slightly later migration up into the Middle East.
p348
aVThese would have been savannah hunters.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours,
p351
aVyou'll get to see what a real savannah is like.
p352
aVAnd it's basically a meat locker.
p353
aVPeople who would have specialized in killing the animals,
p354
aVhunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up,
p355
aVfollowing the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago,
p356
aVduring one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.
p357
aVMigrating eastward, following the grasslands,
p358
aVbecause that's what they were adapted to live on.
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd when they reached Central Asia,
p361
aVthey reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway,
p362
aVa grassland super-highway.
p363
aVThe grasslands at that time \u2014 this was during the last ice age \u2014
p364
aVstretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea,
p365
aVand the entire continent was open to them.
p366
aVEntering Europe around 35,000 years ago,
p367
aVand finally, a small group migrating up
p368
aVthrough the worst weather imaginable, Siberia,
p369
aVinside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age \u2014
p370
aVtemperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps \u2014
p371
aVmigrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.
p372
aa(lp373
VAn amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.
p374
aVThe changes that allowed us to do that,
p375
aVthe evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us,
p376
aVallowing us to create novel cultures,
p377
aVallowing us to develop the diversity
p378
aVthat we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.
p379
aa(lp380
VNow, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour
p381
aVof how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.
p382
aVAnd that's the story that I told a couple of years ago
p383
aVin my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title.
p384
aVAnd as we were finishing up that film \u2014
p385
aVit was co-produced with National Geographic \u2014
p386
aVI started talking to the folks at NG about this work.
p387
aVAnd they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said,
p388
aV"You know, we really see this as kind of
p389
aVthe next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from,
p390
aVusing the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.
p391
aVYou know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA,
p392
aVand we want to take it to the next level.
p393
aVWhat do you want to do next?"
p394
aVWhich is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.
p397
aVIt is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.
p398
aVAnd it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from,
p399
aVyou know, a handful of populations around the world.
p400
aVStudied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.
p401
aVWe've just connected the dots. What we need to do
p402
aVis increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more \u2014
p403
aVhundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world."
p404
aa(lp405
VAnd that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.
p406
aVThe project launched in April 2005.
p407
aVIt has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.
p408
aVThe field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.
p409
aVPeople who have lived in the same location for a long period of time
p410
aVretain a connection to the place where they live
p411
aVthat many of the rest of us have lost.
p412
aVSo my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.
p413
aVI live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.
p414
aVWhere am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.
p415
aVBut there are people who retain that link to their ancestors
p416
aVthat allows us to contextualize the DNA results.
p417
aa(lp418
VThat's the focus of the field research,
p419
aVthe centers that we've set up all over the world \u2014
p420
aV10 of them, top population geneticists.
p421
aVBut, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.
p422
aVHow often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?
p423
aVThe Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.
p424
aa(lp425
VIn this case, you actually can.
p426
aVYou can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.
p427
aVYou can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.
p428
aVAnd you can actually submit those results to the database,
p429
aVand tell us a little about your genealogical background,
p430
aVhave the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.
p431
aa(lp432
VNow, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise,
p433
aVafter we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,
p434
aVgets plowed back into the project.
p435
aVThe majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.
p436
aVIt's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity
p437
aVthat gives money back to indigenous groups around the world
p438
aVfor educational, cultural projects initiated by them.
p439
aVThey apply to this fund in order to do various projects,
p440
aVand I'll show you a couple of examples.
p441
aa(lp442
VSo how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples
p443
aVcollected from indigenous people around the world.
p444
aVThe most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;
p445
aV210,000 people have ordered these participation kits
p446
aVsince we launched two years ago,
p447
aVwhich has raised around five million dollars,
p448
aVthe majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.
p449
aa(lp450
VWe've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.
p451
aVProjects around the world \u2014 documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,
p452
aVpreserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,
p453
aVlanguage revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.
p454
aVSo the project is going very, very well,
p455
aVand I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.
p456
aa(lp457
VThank you very much.
p458
aV(Applause)

VI'm an underwater explorer,
p5
aVmore specifically a cave diver.
p6
aa(lp7
VI wanted to be an astronaut when I was a little kid,
p8
aVbut growing up in Canada as a young girl, that wasn't really available to me.
p9
aVBut as it turns out, we know a lot more about space
p10
aVthan we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet,
p11
aVthe very lifeblood of Mother Earth.
p12
aVSo I decided to do something that was even more remarkable.
p13
aVInstead of exploring outer space,
p14
aVI wanted to explore the wonders of inner space.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, a lot of people will tell you
p17
aVthat cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors.
p18
aVI mean, imagine yourself here in this room,
p19
aVif you were suddenly plunged into blackness,
p20
aVwith your only job to find the exit,
p21
aVsometimes swimming through these large spaces,
p22
aVand at other times crawling beneath the seats,
p23
aVfollowing a thin guideline,
p24
aVjust waiting for the life support to provide your very next breath.
p25
aVWell, that's my workplace.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut what I want to teach you today
p28
aVis that our world is not one big solid rock.
p29
aVIt's a whole lot more like a sponge.
p30
aVI can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth's sponge,
p31
aVbut where I can't,
p32
aVother life-forms and other materials can make that journey without me.
p33
aVAnd my voice is the one that's going to teach you
p34
aVabout the inside of Mother Earth.
p35
aa(lp36
VThere was no guidebook available to me
p37
aVwhen I decided to be the first person to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.
p38
aVIn 2000, this was the largest moving object on the planet.
p39
aVIt calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,
p40
aVand we went down there to explore ice edge ecology
p41
aVand search for life-forms beneath the ice.
p42
aa(lp43
VWe use a technology called rebreathers.
p44
aVIt's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks.
p45
aVThis technology enables us to go deeper
p46
aVthan we could've imagined even 10 years ago.
p47
aVWe use exotic gases,
p48
aVand we can make missions even up to 20 hours long underwater.
p49
aa(lp50
VI work with biologists.
p51
aVIt turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life-forms,
p52
aVspecies that we never knew existed before.
p53
aVMany of these life-forms live in unusual ways.
p54
aVThey have no pigment and no eyes in many cases,
p55
aVand these animals are also extremely long-lived.
p56
aVIn fact, animals swimming in these caves today
p57
aVare identical in the fossil record
p58
aVthat predates the extinction of the dinosaurs.
p59
aVSo imagine that: these are like little swimming dinosaurs.
p60
aVWhat can they teach us about evolution and survival?
p61
aVWhen we look at an animal like this remipede swimming in the jar,
p62
aVhe has giant fangs with venom.
p63
aVHe can actually attack something 40 times his size and kill it.
p64
aVIf he were the size of a cat,
p65
aVhe'd be the most dangerous thing on our planet.
p66
aVAnd these animals live in remarkably beautiful places,
p67
aVand in some cases, caves like this, that are very young,
p68
aVyet the animals are ancient.
p69
aVHow did they get there?
p70
aa(lp71
VI also work with physicists,
p72
aVand they're interested oftentimes in global climate change.
p73
aVThey can take rocks within the caves,
p74
aVand they can slice them and look at the layers within with rocks,
p75
aVmuch like the rings of a tree,
p76
aVand they can count back in history
p77
aVand learn about the climate on our planet at very different times.
p78
aVThe red that you see in this photograph
p79
aVis actually dust from the Sahara Desert.
p80
aVSo it's been picked up by wind, blown across the Atlantic Ocean.
p81
aVIt's rained down in this case on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.
p82
aVIt soaks in through the ground
p83
aVand deposits itself in the rocks within these caves.
p84
aVAnd when we look back in the layers of these rocks, we can find times
p85
aVwhen the climate was very, very dry on earth,
p86
aVand we can go back many hundreds of thousands of years.
p87
aa(lp88
VPaleoclimatologists are also interested
p89
aVin where the sea level stands were at other times on earth.
p90
aVHere in Bermuda, my team and I embarked
p91
aVon the deepest manned dives ever conducted in the region,
p92
aVand we were looking for places
p93
aVwhere the sea level used to lap up against the shoreline,
p94
aVmany hundreds of feet below current levels.
p95
aa(lp96
VI also get to work with paleontologists and archaeologists.
p97
aVIn places like Mexico, in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba,
p98
aVwe're looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves,
p99
aVand they tell us a lot
p100
aVabout some of the earliest inhabitants of these regions.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut my very favorite project of all was over 15 years ago,
p103
aVwhen I was a part of the team that made the very first
p104
aVaccurate, three-dimensional map of a subterranean surface.
p105
aVThis device that I'm driving through the cave
p106
aVwas actually creating a three-dimensional model as we drove it.
p107
aVWe also used ultra low frequency radio
p108
aVto broadcast back to the surface our exact position within the cave.
p109
aVSo I swam under houses and businesses and bowling alleys and golf courses,
p110
aVand even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,
p111
aa(lp112
VPretty remarkable, and what that taught me
p113
aVwas that everything we do on the surface of our earth
p114
aVwill be returned to us to drink.
p115
aVOur water planet is not just rivers, lakes and oceans,
p116
aVbut it's this vast network of groundwater that knits us all together.
p117
aVIt's a shared resource from which we all drink.
p118
aVAnd when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater
p119
aVand all of our water resources on this planet,
p120
aVthen we'll be working on the problem
p121
aVthat's probably the most important issue of this century.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo I never got to be that astronaut that I always wanted to be,
p124
aVbut this mapping device, designed by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.
p125
aVIt's actually morphed.
p126
aVIt's now a self-swimming autonomous robot,
p127
aVartificially intelligent,
p128
aVand its ultimate goal is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa
p129
aVand explore oceans beneath the frozen surface of that body.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd that's pretty amazing.

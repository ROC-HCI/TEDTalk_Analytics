VAbout four years ago, the New Yorker published an article
p5
aVabout a cache of dodo bones that was found
p6
aVin a pit on the island of Mauritius.
p7
aVNow, the island of Mauritius is a small island
p8
aVoff the east coast of Madagascar
p9
aVin the Indian Ocean, and it is the place
p10
aVwhere the dodo bird was discovered
p11
aVand extinguished, all within about 150 years.
p12
aVEveryone was very excited about this archaeological find,
p13
aVbecause it meant that they might finally be able
p14
aVto assemble a single dodo skeleton.
p15
aa(lp16
VSee, while museums all over the world
p17
aVhave dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody \u2014
p18
aVnot even the actual Natural History Museum
p19
aVon the island of Mauritius \u2014 has a skeleton that's made
p20
aVfrom the bones of a single dodo.
p21
aVWell, this isn't exactly true.
p22
aVThe fact is, is that the British Museum
p23
aVhad a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection
p24
aVup until the 18th century \u2014
p25
aVit was actually mummified, skin and all \u2014
p26
aVbut in a fit of space-saving zeal,
p27
aVthey actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet
p28
aVand they burned the rest in a bonfire.
p29
aVIf you go look at their website today,
p30
aVthey'll actually list these specimens, saying,
p31
aVthe rest was lost in a fire.
p32
aa(lp33
VNot quite the whole truth. Anyway.
p34
aVThe frontispiece of this article was this photo,
p35
aVand I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown
p36
aVwas great for bringing photos to the New Yorker,
p37
aVbecause this photo completely rocked my world.
p38
aVI became obsessed with the object \u2014
p39
aVnot just the beautiful photograph itself,
p40
aVand the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible,
p41
aVthe wire you can see on the beak there
p42
aVthat the conservator used to put this skeleton together \u2014
p43
aVthere's an entire story here.
p44
aVAnd I thought to myself,
p45
aVwouldn't it be great
p46
aVif I had my own dodo skeleton?
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VI want to point out here at this point that
p50
aVI've spent my life obsessed
p51
aVby objects and the stories that they tell,
p52
aVand this was the very latest one.
p53
aVSo I began looking around for \u2014
p54
aVto see if anyone sold a kit,
p55
aVsome kind of model that I could get,
p56
aVand I found lots of reference material, lots of lovely pictures.
p57
aVNo dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.
p58
aVI had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons
p59
aVinto my "Creative Projects" folder \u2014
p60
aVit's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.
p61
aVAny time I have an internet connection,
p62
aVthere's a sluice of stuff moving into there,
p63
aVeverything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.
p64
aVThe key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington
p65
aVto celebrate the storming of the Bastille.
p66
aVRussian nuclear launch key:
p67
aVThe one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay;
p68
aVthe one on the bottom is the one I made for myself,
p69
aVbecause I couldn't afford the one on eBay.
p70
aVStorm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth \u2014
p71
aVthat's one I hand-drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder.
p72
aVThis folder has 17,000 photos \u2014
p73
aVover 20 gigabytes of information \u2014
p74
aVand it's growing constantly.
p75
aVAnd one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have been
p76
aVmaybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids,
p77
aVand I was buying some clay tools \u2014 we were going to have a craft day.
p78
aVI bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.
p79
aVAnd I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought,
p80
aVmaybe,
p81
aVyeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.
p82
aa(lp83
VI should point out at this time \u2014 I'm not a sculptor;
p84
aVI'm a hard-edged model maker.
p85
aVYou give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate,
p86
aVyou give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" \u2014
p87
aVespecially parts from "Star Wars" \u2014
p88
aVI can do this stuff all day long.
p89
aVIt's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.
p90
aVBut you give me something like this \u2014
p91
aVmy friend Mike Murnane sculpted this;
p92
aVit's a maquette for "Star Wars, Episode Two" \u2014
p93
aVthis is not my thing \u2014
p94
aVthis is something other people do \u2014 dragons, soft things.
p95
aa(lp96
VHowever, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls
p97
aVto actually be able to
p98
aVunderstand the topology and perhaps replicate it \u2014
p99
aVI mean, it couldn't be that difficult.
p100
aVSo, I started looking at the best photos I could find.
p101
aVI grabbed all the reference,
p102
aVand I found this lovely piece of reference.
p103
aVThis is someone selling this on eBay;
p104
aVit was clearly a woman\u2019s hand, hopefully a woman's hand.
p105
aVAssuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand,
p106
aVI made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.
p107
aVI blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that,
p108
aValong with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it
p109
aVas size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be,
p110
aVexactly how long, etc.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd over a few hours, I eventually achieved
p113
aVwhat was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I \u2014
p114
aVit's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room
p115
aVby picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.
p116
aVI wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton;
p117
aVI just noticed that as I finished this skull,
p118
aVthe armature wire that I had been used to holding it up
p119
aVwas sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.
p120
aVAnd one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years
p121
aVis spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.
p122
aVI actually understood the mechanics
p123
aVof vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.
p124
aVAnd so button by button,
p125
aVvertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.
p126
aVAnd actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull,
p127
aVa moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd again, I kept on going, looking for more reference,
p130
aVevery bit of reference I could find \u2014 drawings, beautiful photos.
p131
aVThis guy \u2014 I love this guy! He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner
p132
aVwith a ruler.
p133
aVThis is the kind of accuracy that I wanted,
p134
aVand I
p135
aVreplicated every last bone and put it in.
p136
aVAnd after about six weeks,
p137
aVI finished, painted, mounted
p138
aVmy own dodo skeleton.
p139
aVYou can see that I even made a museum label for it
p140
aVthat includes a brief history of the dodo.
p141
aVAnd TAP Plastics made me \u2014 although I didn't photograph it \u2014
p142
aVa museum vitrine.
p143
aVI don't have the room for this in my house,
p144
aVbut I had to finish what I had started.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.
p147
aVAgain, like I said, my life has been about
p148
aVbeing fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell,
p149
aVand also making them for myself, obtaining them,
p150
aVappreciating them and diving into them.
p151
aVAnd in this folder, "Creative Projects,"
p152
aVthere are tons of projects that I'm currently working on,
p153
aVprojects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day,
p154
aVand things that I may just want to find and buy and have
p155
aVand look at and touch.
p156
aVBut now there was potentially this new category of things
p157
aVthat I could sculpt
p158
aVthat was different, that I \u2014 you know,
p159
aVI have my own R2D2, but that's \u2014
p160
aVhonestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder,
p163
aVand I happened across the Maltese Falcon.
p164
aVNow, this is funny for me:
p165
aVto fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel,
p166
aVbecause if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people,
p167
aVChandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.
p168
aVBut in this case,
p169
aVit's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story,
p170
aVit's about the object in and of itself.
p171
aVAnd in this case, this object is \u2014
p172
aVplays on a host of levels.
p173
aa(lp174
VFirst of all, there's the object in the world.
p175
aVThis is the "Kniphausen Hawk."
p176
aVIt is a ceremonial pouring vessel
p177
aVmade around 1700 for a Swedish Count,
p178
aVand it is very likely the object from which
p179
aVHammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.
p180
aVThen there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.
p181
aVBuilt out of words, it is the engine
p182
aVthat drives the plot of his book and also the movie,
p183
aVin which another object is created:
p184
aVa prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words,
p185
aVinspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.
p186
aVAnd then there is this fourth level, which is
p187
aVa whole new object in the world:
p188
aVthe prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing,
p189
aVbecomes, in its own right,
p190
aVa whole other thing,
p191
aVa whole new object of desire.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd so now it was time to do some research.
p194
aVI actually had done some research
p195
aVa few years before \u2014 it's why the folder was there.
p196
aVI'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica,
p197
aVof the Maltese Falcon on eBay,
p198
aVand had downloaded enough pictures to actually
p199
aVhave some reasonable reference.
p200
aVBut I discovered,
p201
aVin researching further,
p202
aVreally wanting precise reference, that
p203
aVone of the original lead birds
p204
aVhad been sold at Christie's in 1994,
p205
aVand so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller
p206
aVwho had the original Christie's catalogue,
p207
aVand in it I found this magnificent picture,
p208
aVwhich included a size reference.
p209
aVI was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.
p210
aa(lp211
VI found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan,
p212
aVa New Jersey editor, actually found this
p213
aVresin Maltese Falcon
p214
aVat a flea market in 1991,
p215
aValthough it took him five years
p216
aVto authenticate this bird to
p217
aVthe auctioneers' specifications,
p218
aVbecause there was a lot of controversy about it.
p219
aVIt was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props
p220
aVabout the time the movie was made.
p221
aVIt's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it,
p222
aVbecause I can see it compared to this thing,
p223
aVand I can tell you \u2014 it's real, it's the real thing,
p224
aVit's made from the exact same mold that this one is.
p225
aVIn this one, because the auction was actually so controversial,
p226
aVProfiles in History, the auction house that sold this \u2014
p227
aVI think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars \u2014
p228
aVthey actually included \u2014 you can see here on the bottom \u2014
p229
aVnot just a front elevation, but also
p230
aVa side, rear
p231
aVand other side elevation.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo now, I had all the topology I needed
p234
aVto replicate the Maltese Falcon.
p235
aVWhat do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don't know.
p236
aVSo what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull,
p237
aVI blew all my reference up to full size,
p238
aVand then I began cutting out the negatives and using
p239
aVthose templates as shape references.
p240
aVSo I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it,
p241
aVand I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.
p242
aVAnd then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail,
p243
aVI worked out and achieved \u2014
p244
aVworking in front of the television and Super Sculpey \u2014
p245
aVhere's me sitting next to my wife \u2014
p246
aVit's the only picture I took of the entire process.
p247
aVAs I moved through, I achieved
p248
aVa very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.
p249
aVBut again, I am not a sculptor,
p250
aa(lp251
Vand so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like,
p252
aVI don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey;
p253
aVI certainly wasn't able to get it.
p254
aVSo, I went down to my shop,
p255
aVand I molded it and I cast it in resin,
p256
aVbecause in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.
p257
aVNow there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.
p258
aVMy preference is about 70 coats of this \u2014
p259
aVmatte black auto primer.
p260
aVI spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell,
p261
aVbut it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surface
p262
aVand I can get it glass-smooth.
p263
aVOh, finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.
p264
aVNow, the great thing about getting it to this point was that
p265
aVbecause in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end,
p266
aVand they place it on the table, they actually spin it.
p267
aVSo I was able to actually
p268
aVscreen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.
p269
aVAnd I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light
p270
aVin the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it \u2014
p271
aVthat's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.
p272
aVI ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.
p273
aVAnd it's beautiful. And I can state with authority
p274
aVat this point in time, when I'd finished it,
p275
aVof all of the replicas out there \u2014 and there is a few \u2014
p276
aVthis is by far the most accurate
p277
aVrepresentation of the original Maltese Falcon
p278
aVthan anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you,
p279
aa(lp280
Vis sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.
p281
aVThis is where it gets weird.
p282
aVFred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.
p283
aVTerrifying guy \u2014 agreed by many to be the killer
p284
aVof the Black Dahlia.
p285
aVNow, James Ellroy believes
p286
aVthat Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon,
p287
aVkilled James Elroy's mother.
p288
aVI'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974,
p289
aVduring the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon,"
p290
aVcalled "The Black Bird," starring George Segal,
p291
aVthe Los Angeles County Museum of Art
p292
aVhad a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon \u2014
p293
aVone of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie \u2014
p294
aVstolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought
p295
aVit was a publicity stunt for the movie.
p296
aVJohn's Grill, which actually
p297
aVis seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon,"
p298
aVis still a viable San Francisco eatery,
p299
aVcounted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook,
p300
aVwho played Wilmer Cook in the movie,
p301
aVand he gave them
p302
aVone of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.
p303
aVAnd they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years,
p304
aVuntil it got stolen
p305
aVin January of 2007.
p306
aVIt would seem that the object of desire
p307
aVonly comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo here I had this Falcon,
p310
aVand it was lovely. It looked really great,
p311
aVthe light worked on it really well,
p312
aVit was better than anything that I could achieve
p313
aVor obtain out in the world.
p314
aVBut there was a problem. And the problem was that:
p315
aVI wanted the entirety of the object,
p316
aVI wanted the weight behind the object.
p317
aVThis thing was made of resin and it was too light.
p318
aVThere's this group online that I frequent.
p319
aVIt's a group of prop crazies just like me
p320
aVcalled the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade,
p321
aVmake and travel in information about movie props.
p322
aVAnd it turned out that one of the guys there,
p323
aVa friend of mine that I never actually met,
p324
aVbut befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.
p325
aVHe took my master Falcon pattern,
p326
aVhe actually did lost wax casting
p327
aVin bronze for me,
p328
aVand this is the bronze I got back.
p329
aVAnd this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd this thing, it's deeply, deeply satisfying to me.
p332
aVHere, I'm going to put it out there,
p333
aVlater on tonight, and
p334
aVI want you to pick it up and handle it.
p335
aVYou want to know
p336
aVhow obsessed I am. This project's only for me,
p337
aVand yet I went so far as to buy on eBay
p338
aVa 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper,
p339
aVin order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...
p340
aVlike it is in the movie.
p341
aV(Laughter)
p342
aVYeah, I know!
p343
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p344
aVThere you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.
p345
aVThat's half the weight of my dog, Huxley.
p346
aa(lp347
VBut there's a problem.
p348
aVNow, here's the most recent progression of Falcons.
p349
aVOn the far left is a piece of crap \u2014 a replica I bought on eBay.
p350
aVThere's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon,
p351
aVbecause I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting,
p352
aVthere's my master and there's my bronze.
p353
aVThere's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things,
p354
aVwhich is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin,
p355
aVyou lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.
p356
aVAnd when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one,
p357
aVit was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.
p358
aVYeah, no, really, this was like aah \u2014
p359
aVwhy didn't I remember this?
p360
aVWhy didn't I start and make it bigger?
p361
aVSo what do I do? I figure I have two options.
p362
aVOne, I can fire a freaking laser at it,
p363
aVwhich I have already done,
p364
aVto do a 3D scan \u2014 there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.
p365
aVI had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved
p366
aVgoing from a wax master to a bronze master
p367
aVand blown this up big enough to make
p368
aVa 3D lithography master of this,
p369
aVwhich I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker
p370
aVand then I will have it done in bronze. Or:
p371
aa(lp372
VThere are several people who own originals,
p373
aVand I have been attempting to contact them and reach them,
p374
aVhoping that they will let me spend a few minutes
p375
aVin the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture,
p376
aVor even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner
p377
aVthat I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box,
p378
aVand could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear,
p379
aVget a perfect 3D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages
p380
aVsaying that I'll never let anyone else have it, except for me in my office, I promise.
p381
aVI'll give them one if they want it.
p382
aVAnd then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise.
p383
aVBut really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves,
p384
aVI have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise
p385
aVwas never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it.
p386
aVThank you.

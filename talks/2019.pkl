VFour years ago,
p5
aVa security researcher,
p6
aVor, as most people would call it, a hacker,
p7
aVfound a way to literally
p8
aVmake ATMs throw money at him.
p9
aVHis name was Barnaby Jack,
p10
aVand this technique was later called "jackpotting"
p11
aVin his honor.
p12
aa(lp13
VI'm here today because I think
p14
aVwe actually need hackers.
p15
aVBarnaby Jack
p16
aVcould have easily turned
p17
aVinto a career criminal or James Bond villain
p18
aVwith his knowledge,
p19
aVbut he chose to show the world
p20
aVhis research instead.
p21
aVHe believed that sometimes
p22
aVyou have to demo a threat
p23
aVto spark a solution.
p24
aVAnd I feel the same way.
p25
aVThat's why I'm here today.
p26
aa(lp27
VWe are often terrified and fascinated
p28
aVby the power hackers now have.
p29
aVThey scare us.
p30
aVBut the choices they make
p31
aVhave dramatic outcomes
p32
aVthat influence us all.
p33
aVSo I am here today because I think we need hackers,
p34
aVand in fact, they just might be
p35
aVthe immune system for the information age.
p36
aVSometimes they make us sick,
p37
aVbut they also find those hidden threats
p38
aVin our world,
p39
aVand they make us fix it.
p40
aa(lp41
VI knew that I might get hacked
p42
aVfor giving this talk,
p43
aVso let me save you the effort.
p44
aVIn true TED fashion,
p45
aVhere is my most embarrassing picture.
p46
aVBut it would be difficult for you to find me in it,
p47
aVbecause I'm the one who looks like a boy
p48
aVstanding to the side.
p49
aVI was such a nerd back then
p50
aVthat even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team
p51
aVwouldn't let me join.
p52
aVThis is who I was,
p53
aVbut this is who I wanted to be:
p54
aVAngelina Jolie.
p55
aVShe portrayed Acid Burn
p56
aVin the '95 film "Hackers."
p57
aVShe was pretty and she could rollerblade,
p58
aVbut being a hacker, that made her powerful.
p59
aVAnd I wanted to be just like her,
p60
aVso I started spending a lot of time
p61
aVon hacker chat rooms and online forums.
p62
aVI remember one late night
p63
aVI found a bit of PHP code.
p64
aVI didn't really know what it did,
p65
aVbut I copy-pasted it
p66
aVand used it anyway
p67
aVto get into a password-protected site
p68
aVlike that.
p69
aVOpen Sesame.
p70
aVIt was a simple trick,
p71
aVand I was just a script kiddie back then,
p72
aVbut to me, that trick,
p73
aVit felt like this,
p74
aVlike I had discovered limitless potential
p75
aVat my fingertips.
p76
aVThis is the rush of power that hackers feel.
p77
aVIt's geeks just like me
p78
aVdiscovering they have access to superpower,
p79
aVone that requires the skill and tenacity
p80
aVof their intellect,
p81
aVbut thankfully no radioactive spiders.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut with great power
p84
aVcomes great responsibility,
p85
aVand you all like to think that if we had such powers,
p86
aVwe would only use them for good.
p87
aVBut what if you could read your ex's emails,
p88
aVor add a couple zeros to your bank account.
p89
aVWhat would you do then?
p90
aVIndeed, many hackers do not resist
p91
aVthose temptations,
p92
aVand so they are responsible in one way or another
p93
aVto billions of dollars lost each year
p94
aVto fraud, malware or plain old identity theft,
p95
aVwhich is a serious issue.
p96
aVBut there are other hackers,
p97
aVhackers who just like to break things,
p98
aVand it is precisely those hackers
p99
aVthat can find the weaker elements in our world
p100
aVand make us fix it.
p101
aa(lp102
VThis is what happened last year
p103
aVwhen another security researcher
p104
aVcalled Kyle Lovett
p105
aVdiscovered a gaping hole
p106
aVin the design of certain wireless routers
p107
aVlike you might have in your home or office.
p108
aVHe learned that anyone could remotely connect
p109
aVto these devices over the Internet
p110
aVand download documents from hard drives
p111
aVattached to those routers,
p112
aVno password needed.
p113
aVHe reported it to the company, of course,
p114
aVbut they ignored his report.
p115
aVPerhaps they thought universal access
p116
aVwas a feature, not a bug,
p117
aVuntil two months ago
p118
aVwhen a group of hackers used it
p119
aVto get into people's files.
p120
aVBut they didn't steal anything.
p121
aVThey left a note:
p122
aVYour router and your documents
p123
aVcan be accessed by anyone in the world.
p124
aVHere's what you should do to fix it.
p125
aVWe hope we helped.
p126
aVBy getting into people's files like that,
p127
aVyeah, they broke the law,
p128
aVbut they also forced that company
p129
aVto fix their product.
p130
aa(lp131
VMaking vulnerabilities known to the public
p132
aVis a practice called full disclosure
p133
aVin the hacker community,
p134
aVand it is controversial,
p135
aVbut it does make me think of how hackers
p136
aVhave an evolving effect on technologies we use
p137
aVevery day.
p138
aVThis is what Khalil did.
p139
aVKhalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank,
p140
aVand he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook
p141
aVwhich he attempted to report
p142
aVthrough the company's bug bounty program.
p143
aVThese are usually great arrangements for companies
p144
aVto reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities
p145
aVthey find in their code.
p146
aVUnfortunately, due to some miscommunications,
p147
aVhis report was not acknowledged.
p148
aVFrustrated with the exchange,
p149
aVhe took to use his own discovery
p150
aVto post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.
p151
aVThis got their attention, all right,
p152
aVand they fixed the bug,
p153
aVbut because he hadn't reported it properly,
p154
aVhe was denied the bounty usually paid out
p155
aVfor such discoveries.
p156
aVThankfully for Khalil,
p157
aVa group of hackers were watching out for him.
p158
aVIn fact, they raised more than 13,000 dollars
p159
aVto reward him for this discovery,
p160
aVraising a vital discussion in the technology industry
p161
aVabout how we come up with incentives
p162
aVfor hackers to do the right thing.
p163
aVBut I think there's a greater story here still.
p164
aVEven companies founded by hackers,
p165
aVlike Facebook was,
p166
aVstill have a complicated relationship
p167
aVwhen it comes to hackers.
p168
aVAnd so for more conservative organizations,
p169
aVit is going to take time and adapting
p170
aVin order to embrace hacker culture
p171
aVand the creative chaos that it brings with it.
p172
aVBut I think it's worth the effort,
p173
aVbecause the alternative,
p174
aVto blindly fight all hackers,
p175
aVis to go against the power you cannot control
p176
aVat the cost of stifling innovation
p177
aVand regulating knowledge.
p178
aVThese are things that will come back and bite you.
p179
aa(lp180
VIt is even more true
p181
aVif we go after hackers
p182
aVthat are willing to risk their own freedom
p183
aVfor ideals like the freedom of the web,
p184
aVespecially in times like this, like today even,
p185
aVas governments and corporates
p186
aVfight to control the Internet.
p187
aVI find it astounding
p188
aVthat someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace
p189
aVcan become its voice of opposition,
p190
aVits last line of defense even,
p191
aVperhaps someone like Anonymous,
p192
aVthe leading brand of global hacktivism.
p193
aVThis universal hacker movement
p194
aVneeds no introduction today,
p195
aVbut six years ago
p196
aVthey were not much more than an Internet subculture
p197
aVdedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats
p198
aVand Internet trolling campaigns.
p199
aVTheir moment of transformation was in early 2008
p200
aVwhen the Church of Scientology
p201
aVattempted to remove certain leaked videos
p202
aVfrom appearing on certain websites.
p203
aVThis is when Anonymous was forged
p204
aVout of the seemingly random collection
p205
aVof Internet dwellers.
p206
aVIt turns out,
p207
aVthe Internet doesn't like it
p208
aVwhen you try to remove things from it,
p209
aVand it will react with cyberattacks
p210
aVand elaborate pranks
p211
aVand with a series of organized protests
p212
aVall around the world,
p213
aVfrom my hometown of Tel Aviv
p214
aVto Adelaide, Australia.
p215
aVThis proved that Anonymous and this idea
p216
aVcan rally the masses from the keyboards
p217
aVto the streets,
p218
aVand it laid the foundations
p219
aVfor dozens of future operations
p220
aVagainst perceived injustices
p221
aVto their online and offline world.
p222
aVSince then, they've gone after many targets.
p223
aVThey've uncovered corruption, abuse.
p224
aVThey've hacked popes and politicians,
p225
aVand I think their effect is larger
p226
aVthan simple denial of service attacks
p227
aVthat take down websites
p228
aVor even leak sensitive documents.
p229
aVI think that, like Robin Hood,
p230
aVthey are in the business of redistribution,
p231
aVbut what they are after isn't your money.
p232
aVIt's not your documents. It's your attention.
p233
aVThey grab the spotlight for causes they support,
p234
aVforcing us to take note,
p235
aVacting as a global magnifying glass
p236
aVfor issues that we are not as aware of
p237
aVbut perhaps we should be.
p238
aVThey have been called many names
p239
aVfrom criminals to terrorists,
p240
aVand I cannot justify their illegal means,
p241
aVbut the ideas they fight for
p242
aVare ones that matter to us all.
p243
aVThe reality is,
p244
aVhackers can do a lot more than break things.
p245
aVThey can bring people together.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd if the Internet doesn't like it
p248
aVwhen you try to remove things from it,
p249
aVjust watch what happens
p250
aVwhen you try to shut the Internet down.
p251
aVThis took place in Egypt in January 2011,
p252
aVand as President Hosni Mubarak
p253
aVattempted a desperate move
p254
aVto quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo,
p255
aVhe sent his personal troops
p256
aVdown to Egypt's Internet service providers
p257
aVand had them physically kill the switch
p258
aVon the country's connection to the world overnight.
p259
aVFor a government to do a thing like that
p260
aVwas unprecedented,
p261
aVand for hackers, it made it personal.
p262
aVHackers like the Telecomix group
p263
aVwere already active on the ground,
p264
aVhelping Egyptians bypass censorship
p265
aVusing clever workarounds like Morse code
p266
aVand ham radio.
p267
aVIt was high season for low tech,
p268
aVwhich the government couldn't block,
p269
aVbut when the Net went completely down,
p270
aVTelecomix brought in the big guns.
p271
aVThey found European service providers
p272
aVthat still had 20-year-old
p273
aVanalog dial-up access infrastructure.
p274
aVThey opened up 300 of those lines
p275
aVfor Egyptians to use,
p276
aVserving slow but sweet Internet connection
p277
aVfor Egyptians.
p278
aVThis worked.
p279
aVIt worked so well, in fact,
p280
aVone guy even used it to download an episode
p281
aVof "How I Met Your Mother."
p282
aVBut while Egypt's future is still uncertain,
p283
aVwhen the same thing happened in Syria
p284
aVjust one year later,
p285
aVTelecomix were prepared with those Internet lines,
p286
aVand Anonymous,
p287
aVthey were perhaps the first international group
p288
aVto officially denounce the actions
p289
aVof the Syrian military
p290
aVby defacing their website.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut with this sort of power,
p293
aVit really depends on where you stand,
p294
aVbecause one man's hero
p295
aVcan be another's villain,
p296
aVand so the Syrian Electronic Army
p297
aVis a pro-Assad group of hackers
p298
aVwho support his contentious regime.
p299
aVThey've taken down multiple high-profile targets
p300
aVin the past few years,
p301
aVincluding the Associated Press's Twitter account,
p302
aVin which they posted a message
p303
aVabout an attack on the White House
p304
aVinjuring President Obama.
p305
aVThis tweet was fake, of course,
p306
aVbut the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index
p307
aVthat day was most certainly not,
p308
aVand a lot of people lost a lot of money.
p309
aa(lp310
VThis sort of thing is happening all over the world right now.
p311
aVIn conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula
p312
aVto Latin America,
p313
aVfrom Europe to the United States,
p314
aVhackers are a force for social,
p315
aVpolitical and military influence.
p316
aVAs individuals or in groups,
p317
aVvolunteers or military conflicts,
p318
aVthere are hackers everywhere.
p319
aVThey come from all walks of life,
p320
aVethnicities, ideologies and genders, I might add.
p321
aVThey are now shaping the world's stage.
p322
aVHackers represent an exceptional force for change
p323
aVin the 21st century.
p324
aVThis is because access to information
p325
aVis a critical currency of power,
p326
aVone which governments would like to control,
p327
aVa thing they attempt to do by setting up
p328
aVall-you-can-eat surveillance programs,
p329
aVa thing they need hackers for, by the way.
p330
aVAnd so the establishment has long had
p331
aVa love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers,
p332
aVbecause the same people who demonize hacking
p333
aValso utilize it at large.
p334
aa(lp335
VTwo years ago,
p336
aVI saw General Keith Alexander.
p337
aVHe's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander,
p338
aVbut instead of his four star general uniform,
p339
aVhe was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.
p340
aVThis was at DEF CON,
p341
aVthe world's largest hacker conference.
p342
aVPerhaps like me, General Alexander
p343
aVdidn't see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas.
p344
aVI think he saw untapped potential.
p345
aVIn fact, he was there to give a hiring pitch.
p346
aV"In this room right here," he said,
p347
aV"is the talent our nation needs."
p348
aVWell, hackers in the back row replied,
p349
aV"Then stop arresting us."
p350
aV(Applause)
p351
aa(lp352
VIndeed, for years,
p353
aVhackers have been on the wrong side of the fence,
p354
aVbut in light of what we know now,
p355
aVwho is more watchful of our online world?
p356
aVThe rules of the game are not that clear anymore,
p357
aVbut hackers are perhaps the only ones
p358
aVstill capable of challenging overreaching governments
p359
aVand data-hoarding corporates
p360
aVon their own playing field.
p361
aVTo me, that represents hope.
p362
aa(lp363
VFor the past three decades,
p364
aVhackers have done a lot of things,
p365
aVbut they have also impacted civil liberties,
p366
aVinnovation and Internet freedom,
p367
aVso I think it's time we take a good look
p368
aVat how we choose to portray them,
p369
aVbecause if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys,
p370
aVhow can they be the heroes too?
p371
aVMy years in the hacker world
p372
aVhave made me realize
p373
aVboth the problem and the beauty about hackers:
p374
aVThey just can't see something broken in the world
p375
aVand leave it be.
p376
aVThey are compelled
p377
aVto either exploit it or try and change it,
p378
aVand so they find the vulnerable aspects
p379
aVin our rapidly changing world.
p380
aVThey make us, they force us to fix things
p381
aVor demand something better,
p382
aVand I think we need them
p383
aVto do just that,
p384
aVbecause after all, it is not information
p385
aVthat wants to be free, it's us.
p386
aa(lp387
VThank you very much.
p388
aa(lp389
VThank you. (Applause)
p390
aa(lp391
VHack the planet!

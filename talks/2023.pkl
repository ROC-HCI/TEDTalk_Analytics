VThink of a hard choice you'll face in the near future.
p5
aVIt might be between two careers \u2014
p6
aVartist and accountant \u2014
p7
aVor places to live \u2014 the city or the country \u2014
p8
aVor even between two people to marry \u2014
p9
aVyou could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita.
p10
aVOr it might be a choice about whether to have children,
p11
aVto have an ailing parent move in with you,
p12
aVto raise your child in a religion that your partner lives by
p13
aVbut leaves you cold.
p14
aVOr whether to donate your life savings to charity.
p15
aa(lp16
VChances are, the hard choice you thought of was something big,
p17
aVsomething momentous, something that matters to you.
p18
aVHard choices seem to be occasions
p19
aVfor agonizing, hand-wringing, the gnashing of teeth.
p20
aVBut I think we've misunderstood hard choices
p21
aVand the role they play in our lives.
p22
aVUnderstanding hard choices
p23
aVuncovers a hidden power each of us possesses.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhat makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate.
p26
aVIn any easy choice,
p27
aVone alternative is better than the other.
p28
aVIn a hard choice,
p29
aVone alternative is better in some ways,
p30
aVthe other alternative is better in other ways,
p31
aVand neither is better than the other overall.
p32
aVYou agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city
p33
aVor uproot your life for more challenging work in the country,
p34
aVbecause staying is better in some ways,
p35
aVmoving is better in others,
p36
aVand neither is better than the other overall.
p37
aa(lp38
VWe shouldn't think that all hard choices are big.
p39
aVLet's say you're deciding what to have for breakfast.
p40
aVYou could have high fiber bran cereal
p41
aVor a chocolate donut.
p42
aVSuppose what matters in the choice is tastiness and healthfulness.
p43
aVThe cereal is better for you,
p44
aVthe donut tastes way better,
p45
aVbut neither is better than the other overall,
p46
aVa hard choice.
p47
aVRealizing that small choices can also be hard,
p48
aVmay make big hard choices seem less intractable.
p49
aVAfter all, we manage to figure out what to have for breakfast,
p50
aVso maybe we can figure out whether to stay in the city
p51
aVor uproot for the new job in the country.
p52
aa(lp53
VWe also shouldn't think that hard choices are hard
p54
aVbecause we are stupid.
p55
aVWhen I graduated from college,
p56
aVI couldn't decide between two careers, philosophy and law.
p57
aVI really loved philosophy.
p58
aVThere are amazing things you can learn as a philosopher,
p59
aVand all from the comfort of an armchair.
p60
aVBut I came from a modest immigrant family
p61
aVwhere my idea of luxury
p62
aVwas having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich
p63
aVin my school lunchbox,
p64
aVso the thought of spending my whole life
p65
aVsitting around in armchairs just thinking ...
p66
aVWell, that struck me as the height of extravagance and frivolity.
p67
aVSo I got out my yellow pad,
p68
aVI drew a line down the middle,
p69
aVand I tried my best to think of the reasons
p70
aVfor and against each alternative.
p71
aVI remember thinking to myself,
p72
aVif only I knew what my life in each career would be like.
p73
aVIf only God or Netflix would send me a DVD of my two possible future careers,
p74
aVI'd be set.
p75
aVI'd compare them side by side,
p76
aVI'd see that one was better,
p77
aVand the choice would be easy.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut I got no DVD,
p80
aVand because I couldn't figure out which was better,
p81
aVI did what many of us do in hard choices:
p82
aVI took the safest option.
p83
aVFear of being an unemployed philosopher led me to become a lawyer,
p84
aVand as I discovered, lawyering didn't quite fit.
p85
aVIt wasn't who I was.
p86
aVSo now I'm a philosopher,
p87
aVand I study hard choices,
p88
aVand I can tell you, that fear of the unknown,
p89
aVwhile a common motivational default in dealing with hard choices,
p90
aVrests on a misconception of them.
p91
aVIt's a mistake to think that in hard choices,
p92
aVone alternative really is better than the other,
p93
aVbut we're too stupid to know which,
p94
aVand since we don't know which,
p95
aVwe might as well take the least risky option.
p96
aVEven taking two alternatives side by side
p97
aVwith full information, a choice can still be hard.
p98
aVHard choices are hard not because of us or our ignorance;
p99
aVthey're hard because there is no best option.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, if there's no best option,
p102
aVif the scales don't tip in favor of one alternative over another,
p103
aVthen surely the alternatives must be equally good.
p104
aVSo maybe the right thing to say in hard choices
p105
aVis that they're between equally good options.
p106
aVBut that can't be right.
p107
aVIf alternatives are equally good, you should just flip a coin between them,
p108
aVand it seems a mistake to think,
p109
aVhere's how you should decide between careers,
p110
aVplaces to live, people to marry:
p111
aVFlip a coin.
p112
aa(lp113
VThere's another reason for thinking
p114
aVthat hard choices aren't choices between equally good options.
p115
aVSuppose you have a choice between two jobs:
p116
aVyou could be an investment banker
p117
aVor a graphic artist.
p118
aVThere are a variety of things that matter in such a choice,
p119
aVlike the excitement of the work,
p120
aVachieving financial security,
p121
aVhaving time to raise a family, and so on.
p122
aVMaybe the artist's career puts you on the cutting edge
p123
aVof new forms of pictorial expression.
p124
aVMaybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge
p125
aVof new forms of financial manipulation.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VImagine the two jobs however you like,
p130
aVso that neither is better than the other.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow suppose we improve one of them, a bit.
p133
aVSuppose the bank, wooing you,
p134
aVadds 500 dollars a month to your salary.
p135
aVDoes the extra money
p136
aVnow make the banking job better than the artist one?
p137
aVNot necessarily.
p138
aVA higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before,
p139
aVbut it might not be enough
p140
aVto make being a banker better than being an artist.
p141
aVBut if an improvement in one of the jobs doesn't make it better than the other,
p142
aVthen the two original jobs could not have been equally good.
p143
aVIf you start with two things that are equally good,
p144
aVand you improve one of them,
p145
aVit now must be better than the other.
p146
aVThat's not the case with options in hard choices.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo now we've got a puzzle.
p149
aVWe've got two jobs.
p150
aVNeither is better than the other, nor are they equally good.
p151
aVSo how are we supposed to choose?
p152
aVSomething seems to have gone wrong here.
p153
aVMaybe the choice itself is problematic, and comparison is impossible.
p154
aVBut that can't be right.
p155
aVIt's not like we're trying to choose between two things that can't be compared.
p156
aVWe're weighing the merits of two jobs, after all,
p157
aVnot the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs.
p158
aVA comparison of the overall merits of two jobs
p159
aVis something we can make,
p160
aVand one we often do make.
p161
aa(lp162
VI think the puzzle arises
p163
aVbecause of an unreflective assumption we make about value.
p164
aVWe unwittingly assume that values like justice, beauty, kindness,
p165
aVare akin to scientific quantities, like length, mass and weight.
p166
aVTake any comparative question not involving value,
p167
aVsuch as which of two suitcases is heavier.
p168
aVThere are only three possibilities.
p169
aVThe weight of one is greater, lesser or equal to the weight of the other.
p170
aVProperties like weight can be represented by real numbers \u2014
p171
aVone, two, three and so on \u2014
p172
aVand there are only three possible comparisons
p173
aVbetween any two real numbers.
p174
aVOne number is greater, lesser, or equal to the other.
p175
aVNot so with values.
p176
aVAs post-Enlightenment creatures,
p177
aVwe tend to assume
p178
aVthat scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world,
p179
aVbut the world of value is different from the world of science.
p180
aVThe stuff of the one world can be quantified by real numbers.
p181
aVThe stuff of the other world can't.
p182
aVWe shouldn't assume that the world of is, of lengths and weights,
p183
aVhas the same structure as the world of ought,
p184
aVof what we should do.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo if what matters to us \u2014
p187
aVa child's delight, the love you have for your partner \u2014
p188
aVcan't be represented by real numbers,
p189
aVthen there's no reason to believe
p190
aVthat in choice, there are only three possibilities \u2014
p191
aVthat one alternative is better, worse or equal to the other.
p192
aVWe need to introduce a new, fourth relation
p193
aVbeyond being better, worse or equal,
p194
aVthat describes what's going on in hard choices.
p195
aVI like to say that the alternatives are "on a par."
p196
aVWhen alternatives are on a par,
p197
aVit may matter very much which you choose,
p198
aVbut one alternative isn't better than the other.
p199
aVRather, the alternatives are in the same neighborhood of value,
p200
aVin the same league of value,
p201
aVwhile at the same time being very different in kind of value.
p202
aVThat's why the choice is hard.
p203
aa(lp204
VUnderstanding hard choices in this way
p205
aVuncovers something about ourselves we didn't know.
p206
aVEach of us has the power to create reasons.
p207
aVImagine a world in which every choice you face
p208
aVis an easy choice,
p209
aVthat is, there's always a best alternative.
p210
aVIf there's a best alternative, then that's the one you should choose,
p211
aVbecause part of being rational
p212
aVis doing the better thing rather than the worse thing,
p213
aVchoosing what you have most reason to choose.
p214
aVIn such a world,
p215
aVwe'd have most reason
p216
aVto wear black socks instead of pink socks,
p217
aVto eat cereal instead of donuts,
p218
aVto live in the city rather than the country,
p219
aVto marry Betty instead of Lolita.
p220
aVA world full of only easy choices would enslave us to reasons.
p221
aa(lp222
VWhen you think about it,
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
Vit's nuts to believe that the reasons given to you
p227
aVdictated that you had most reason to pursue
p228
aVthe exact hobbies you do,
p229
aVto live in the exact house you do,
p230
aVto work at the exact job you do.
p231
aVInstead, you faced alternatives that were on a par \u2014
p232
aVhard choices \u2014
p233
aVand you made reasons for yourself
p234
aVto choose that hobby, that house and that job.
p235
aVWhen alternatives are on a par,
p236
aVthe reasons given to us,
p237
aVthe ones that determine whether we're making a mistake,
p238
aVare silent as to what to do.
p239
aVIt's here, in the space of hard choices,
p240
aVthat we get to exercise our normative power \u2014
p241
aVthe power to create reasons for yourself,
p242
aVto make yourself into the kind of person
p243
aVfor whom country living is preferable to the urban life.
p244
aa(lp245
VWhen we choose between options that are on a par,
p246
aVwe can do something really rather remarkable.
p247
aVWe can put our very selves behind an option.
p248
aVHere's where I stand.
p249
aVHere's who I am, I am for banking.
p250
aVI am for chocolate donuts.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VThis response in hard choices is a rational response,
p255
aVbut it's not dictated by reasons given to us.
p256
aVRather, it's supported by reasons created by us.
p257
aVWhen we create reasons for ourselves
p258
aVto become this kind of person rather than that,
p259
aVwe wholeheartedly become the people that we are.
p260
aVYou might say that we become the authors of our own lives.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo when we face hard choices, we shouldn't beat our head against a wall
p263
aVtrying to figure out which alternative is better.
p264
aVThere is no best alternative.
p265
aVInstead of looking for reasons out there,
p266
aVwe should be looking for reasons in here:
p267
aVWho am I to be?
p268
aVYou might decide to be a pink sock-wearing,
p269
aVcereal-loving, country-living banker,
p270
aVand I might decide to be a black sock-wearing,
p271
aVurban, donut-loving artist.
p272
aVWhat we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow, people who don't exercise their normative powers in hard choices
p275
aVare drifters.
p276
aVWe all know people like that.
p277
aVI drifted into being a lawyer.
p278
aVI didn't put my agency behind lawyering.
p279
aVI wasn't for lawyering.
p280
aVDrifters allow the world to write the story of their lives.
p281
aVThey let mechanisms of reward and punishment \u2014
p282
aVpats on the head, fear, the easiness of an option \u2014
p283
aVto determine what they do.
p284
aVSo the lesson of hard choices:
p285
aVreflect on what you can put your agency behind,
p286
aVon what you can be for,
p287
aVand through hard choices,
p288
aVbecome that person.
p289
aa(lp290
VFar from being sources of agony and dread,
p291
aVhard choices are precious opportunities
p292
aVfor us to celebrate what is special about the human condition,
p293
aVthat the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect
p294
aVsometimes run out,
p295
aVand it is here, in the space of hard choices,
p296
aVthat we have the power to create reasons for ourselves
p297
aVto become the distinctive people that we are.
p298
aVAnd that's why hard choices are not a curse
p299
aVbut a godsend.
p300
aa(lp301
VThank you.

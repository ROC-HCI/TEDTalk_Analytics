VThere are 39 million people in the world
p5
aVwho are blind.
p6
aVEighty percent of them
p7
aVare living in low-income countries such as Kenya,
p8
aVand the absolute majority
p9
aVdo not need to be blind.
p10
aVThey are blind from diseases
p11
aVthat are either completely curable or preventable.
p12
aa(lp13
VKnowing this, with my young family,
p14
aVwe moved to Kenya.
p15
aVWe secured equipment,
p16
aVfunds, vehicles, we trained a team,
p17
aVwe set up a hundred clinics throughout
p18
aVthe Great Rift Valley
p19
aVto try and understand a single question:
p20
aVwhy are people going blind,
p21
aVand what can we do?
p22
aa(lp23
VThe challenges were great.
p24
aVWhen we got to where we were going,
p25
aVwe set up our high-tech equipment.
p26
aVPower was rarely available.
p27
aVWe'd have to run our equipment
p28
aVfrom petrol power generators.
p29
aVAnd then something occurred to me:
p30
aVThere has to be an easier way,
p31
aVbecause it's the patients who are the most in need
p32
aVof access to eye care
p33
aVwho are the least likely to get it.
p34
aa(lp35
VMore people in Kenya,
p36
aVand in sub-Saharan Africa,
p37
aVhave access to a mobile phone
p38
aVthan they do clean running water.
p39
aVSo we said, could we harness
p40
aVthe power of mobile technology
p41
aVto deliver eye care in a new way?
p42
aVAnd so we developed Peek,
p43
aVa smartphone [system] that enables
p44
aVcommunity healthcare workers
p45
aVand empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere.
p46
aVWe set about replacing traditional hospital equipment,
p47
aVwhich is bulky, expensive and fragile,
p48
aVwith smartphone apps and hardware
p49
aVthat make it possible to test anyone
p50
aVin any language and of any age.
p51
aVHere we have a demonstration
p52
aVof a three-month-old having their vision
p53
aVaccurately tested using an app and an eye tracker.
p54
aa(lp55
VWe've got many trials going on
p56
aVin the community and in schools,
p57
aVand through the lessons that we've learned in the field,
p58
aVwe've realized it's extremely important
p59
aVto share the data in non-medical jargon
p60
aVso that people understand
p61
aVwhat we're examining and what that means to them.
p62
aVSo here, for example,
p63
aVwe use our sight sim application,
p64
aVonce your vision has been measured,
p65
aVto show carers and teachers
p66
aVwhat the visual world is like for that person,
p67
aVso they can empathize with them and help them.
p68
aa(lp69
VOnce we've discovered somebody has low vision,
p70
aVthe next big challenge is to work out why,
p71
aVand to be able to do that,
p72
aVwe need to have access to the inside of the eye.
p73
aVTraditionally, this requires expensive equipment
p74
aVto examine an area called the retina.
p75
aVThe retina is the single part of the eye that has
p76
aVhuge amounts of information about the body
p77
aVand its health.
p78
aVWe've developed 3D-printed,
p79
aVlow-cost hardware
p80
aVthat comes in at less than five dollars to produce,
p81
aVwhich can then be clipped onto a smartphone
p82
aVand makes it possible to get views
p83
aVof the back of the eye
p84
aVof a very high quality.
p85
aVAnd the beauty is, anybody can do it.
p86
aVIn our trials on over two and half thousand people,
p87
aVthe smartphone with the add-on clip
p88
aVis comparable to a camera
p89
aVthat is hugely more expensive
p90
aVand hugely more difficult to transport.
p91
aa(lp92
VWhen we first moved to Kenya,
p93
aVwe went with 150,000 dollars of equipment,
p94
aVa team of 15 people,
p95
aVand that was what was needed to deliver health care.
p96
aVNow, all that's needed
p97
aVis a single person
p98
aVon a bike with a smartphone.
p99
aVAnd it costs just 500 dollars.
p100
aVThe issue of power supply
p101
aVis overcome by harnessing the power of solar.
p102
aVOur healthcare workers travel
p103
aVwith a solar-powered rucksack
p104
aVwhich keeps the phone charged and backed up.
p105
aVNow we go to the patient
p106
aVrather than waiting for the patient never to come.
p107
aVWe go to them in their homes
p108
aVand we give them the most comprehensive,
p109
aVhigh-tech, accurate examination,
p110
aVwhich can be delivered by anyone with minimal training.
p111
aVWe can link global experts
p112
aVwith people in the most rural,
p113
aVdifficult-to-reach places
p114
aVthat are beyond the end of the road,
p115
aVeffectively putting those experts in their homes,
p116
aVallowing us to make diagnoses
p117
aVand make plans for treatment.
p118
aa(lp119
VProject managers, hospital directors,
p120
aVare able to search on our interface
p121
aVby any parameter they may be interested in.
p122
aVHere in Nakuru, where I've been living,
p123
aVwe can search for people
p124
aVby whatever condition.
p125
aVHere are people who are blind
p126
aVfrom a curable condition cataract.
p127
aVEach red pin depicts somebody
p128
aVwho is blind from a disease that is curable
p129
aVand treatable, and they're locatable.
p130
aVWe can use bulk text messaging services
p131
aVto explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment.
p132
aa(lp133
VWhat's more, we've learned that this is something
p134
aVthat we haven't built just for the community
p135
aVbut with the community.
p136
aVThose blue pins that drop represent
p137
aVelders, or local leaders,
p138
aVthat are connected to those people
p139
aVwho can ensure that we can find them
p140
aVand arrange treatment.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo for patients like Mama Wangari,
p143
aVwho have been blind for over 10 years
p144
aVand never seen her grandchildren,
p145
aVfor less than 40 dollars, we can restore her eyesight.
p146
aVThis is something that has to happen.
p147
aVIt's only in statistics
p148
aVthat people go blind by the millions.
p149
aVThe reality is everyone goes blind on their own.
p150
aVBut now, they might just be
p151
aVa text message away from help.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Applause)
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd now because live demos are always a bad idea,
p156
aVwe're going to try a live demo.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VSo here we have the Peek Vision app.
p161
aVOkay, and what we're looking at here,
p162
aVthis is Sam's optic nerve,
p163
aVwhich is a direct extension of her brain,
p164
aVso I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there.
p165
aVWe can see all parts of the retina.
p166
aVIt makes it possible to pick up diseases
p167
aVof the eye and of the body
p168
aVthat would not be possible without access to the eye,
p169
aVand that clip-on device can be manufactured
p170
aVfor just a few dollars,
p171
aVand people can be cured of blindness,
p172
aVand I think it says a lot about us as a human race
p173
aVif we've developed cures and we don't deliver them.
p174
aVBut now we can.
p175
aa(lp176
VThank you.

VGood morning, ladies and gentlemen.
p5
aVMy name is Art Benjamin, and I am a "mathemagician."
p6
aVWhat that means is, I combine my loves of math and magic
p7
aVto do something I call "mathemagics."
p8
aa(lp9
VBut before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience.
p10
aVBy any chance, did anyone happen
p11
aVto bring with them this morning a calculator?
p12
aVSeriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand.
p13
aVRaise your hand. Did your hand go up?
p14
aVNow bring it out, bring it out. Anybody else?
p15
aVI see, I see one way in the back.
p16
aVYou sir, that's three.
p17
aVAnd anybody on this side here?
p18
aVOK, over there on the aisle.
p19
aVWould the four of you please bring out your calculators,
p20
aVthen join me up on stage.
p21
aVLet's give them a nice round of applause.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Applause)
p24
aa(lp25
VThat's right.
p26
aVNow, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators,
p27
aVI need to make sure that they are all working properly.
p28
aVWould somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number, please?
p29
aVHow about a two-digit number?
p30
aa(lp31
VAudience: 22.
p32
aa(lp33
VAB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir?
p34
aa(lp35
VAudience: 47.
p36
aa(lp37
VAB: Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034,
p38
aVor the calculators are not working.
p39
aVDo all of you get 1,034? 1,034?
p40
aa(lp41
VVolunteer: No.
p42
aa(lp43
VAB: 594. Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Applause)
p46
aa(lp47
VWould you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?
p48
aVOK, great.
p49
aVWhat I'm going to try and do then \u2014
p50
aVI notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.
p51
aVThat's OK.
p52
aVI'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator.
p53
aVThere is something called the square of a number,
p54
aVwhich most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself.
p55
aVFor instance, five squared would be?
p56
aa(lp57
VAudience: 25.
p58
aa(lp59
VAB: 25. The way we can square on most calculators \u2014
p60
aVlet me demonstrate with this one \u2014
p61
aVis by taking the number, such as five,
p62
aVhitting "times" and then "equals,"
p63
aVand on most calculators that will give you the square.
p64
aVOn some of these ancient RPN calculators,
p65
aVyou've got an "x squared" button on it,
p66
aVwill allow you to do the calculation even faster.
p67
aVWhat I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head,
p68
aVfour two-digit numbers
p69
aVfaster than they can do on their calculators,
p70
aVeven using the shortcut method.
p71
aVWhat I'll use is the second row this time,
p72
aVand I'll get four of you
p73
aVto each yell out a two-digit number,
p74
aVand if you would square the first number,
p75
aVand if you would square the second, the third and the fourth,
p76
aVI will try and race you to the answer. OK?
p77
aVSo quickly, a two-digit number please.
p78
aa(lp79
VAudience: 37.
p80
aa(lp81
VArthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK.
p82
aa(lp83
VAudience: 23.
p84
aa(lp85
VAB: 23 squared, OK.
p86
aa(lp87
VAudience: 59.
p88
aa(lp89
VAB: 59 squared, OK, and finally?
p90
aa(lp91
VAudience: 93.
p92
aa(lp93
VAB: 93 squared.
p94
aVWould you call out your answers, please?
p95
aa(lp96
VVolunteer: 1369. AB: 1369.
p97
aa(lp98
VVolunteer: 529. AB: 529.
p99
aa(lp100
VVolunteer: 3481. AB: 3481.
p101
aa(lp102
VVolunteer: 8649.
p103
aa(lp104
VAB: Thank you very much.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VLet me try to take this one step further.
p109
aVI'm going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time.
p110
aVI won't even write these down \u2014
p111
aVI'll just call them out as they're called out to me.
p112
aVAnyone I point to, call out a three-digit number.
p113
aVAnyone on our panel, verify the answer.
p114
aVJust give some indication if it's right.
p115
aVA three-digit number, sir, yes?
p116
aa(lp117
VAudience: 987.
p118
aa(lp119
VAB: 987 squared is 974,169.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VAB: Yes? Good.
p124
aVAnother three-digit \u2014
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aV\u2014 another three-digit number, sir?
p128
aa(lp129
VAudience: 457.
p130
aa(lp131
VAB: 457 squared is 205,849.
p132
aV205,849?
p133
aVAB: Yes?
p134
aVOK, another, another three-digit number, sir?
p135
aa(lp136
VAudience: 321.
p137
aa(lp138
VAB: 321 is 103,041.
p139
aV103,041.
p140
aVYes? One more three-digit number please.
p141
aa(lp142
VAudience: Oh, 722.
p143
aa(lp144
VAB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one.
p145
aVIs that 513,284?
p146
aa(lp147
VVolunteer: Yes.
p148
aa(lp149
VAB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more three-digit number please.
p150
aa(lp151
VAudience: 162.
p152
aV162 squared is 26,244.
p153
aa(lp154
VVolunteer: Yes.
p155
aa(lp156
VThank you very much.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
V(Applause ends)
p161
aa(lp162
VLet me try to take this one step further.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VI'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time.
p167
aVYou can all take your time on this;
p168
aVI will not beat you to the answer on this one,
p169
aVbut I will try to get the answer right.
p170
aVTo make this a little bit more random, let's take the fourth row this time,
p171
aVlet's say, one, two, three, four.
p172
aVIf each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine,
p173
aVthat will be the four-digit number that I'll square.
p174
aa(lp175
VNine.
p176
aa(lp177
VSeven.
p178
aa(lp179
VFive.
p180
aa(lp181
VEight.
p182
aV9,758, this will take me a little bit of time, so bear with me.
p183
aV95 million \u2014
p184
aa(lp185
V(Sighs)
p186
aV218,564?
p187
aa(lp188
VVolunteer: Yes!
p189
aa(lp190
VAB: Thank you very much.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
V(Applause ends)
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, I would attempt to square a five-digit number \u2014
p197
aVand I can \u2014
p198
aVbut unfortunately, most calculators cannot.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VEight-digit capacity \u2014 don't you hate that?
p203
aVSo, since we've reached the limits of our calculators \u2014
p204
aVwhat's that?
p205
aVDoes yours go higher?
p206
aa(lp207
VVolunteer: I don't know.
p208
aa(lp209
VAB: Oh, yours does?
p210
aa(lp211
VVolunteer: I can probably do it. AB: I'll talk to you later.
p212
aVIn the meanwhile, let me conclude
p213
aVthe first part of my show by doing something a little trickier.
p214
aVLet's take the largest number on the board here, 8649.
p215
aVWould you each enter that on your calculator?
p216
aVAnd instead of squaring it this time,
p217
aVI want you to take that number and multiply it
p218
aVby any three-digit number that you want,
p219
aVbut don't tell me what you're multiplying by \u2014
p220
aVjust multiply it by any random three-digit number.
p221
aVSo you should have as an answer either
p222
aVa six-digit or probably a seven-digit number.
p223
aVHow many digits do you have, six or seven?
p224
aa(lp225
VSeven, and yours?
p226
aa(lp227
VSeven? Seven?
p228
aVAnd, uncertain.
p229
aa(lp230
VSeven.
p231
aVIs there any possible way that I could know
p232
aVwhat seven-digit numbers you have?
p233
aVSay "No."
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VGood, then I shall attempt the impossible \u2014
p238
aVor at least the improbable.
p239
aVWhat I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me
p240
aVany six of your seven digits, any six of them,
p241
aVin any order you'd like.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VOne digit at a time,
p246
aVI shall try and determine the digit you've left out.
p247
aVStarting with your seven-digit number,
p248
aVcall out any six of them please.
p249
aa(lp250
VVolunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2.
p251
aa(lp252
VAB: Did you leave out the number 6?
p253
aa(lp254
VGood, OK, that's one.
p255
aVYou have a seven-digit number, call out any six of them please.
p256
aa(lp257
VVolunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5.
p258
aa(lp259
VI think I only heard five numbers. I \u2014 wait \u2014 44875 \u2014
p260
aVdid you leave out the number 6?
p261
aa(lp262
VSame as she did, OK.
p263
aVYou've got a seven-digit number \u2014
p264
aVcall out any six of them loud and clear.
p265
aa(lp266
VVolunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4.
p267
aa(lp268
VI think you left out the number 3?
p269
aa(lp270
VAB: That's three.
p271
aVThe odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing
p272
aVwould be one in 10,000: 10 to the fourth power.
p273
aVOK, any six of them.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VReally scramble them up this time, please.
p278
aa(lp279
VVolunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2.
p280
aa(lp281
VDid you leave out the number 7?
p282
aVAnd let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause.
p283
aVThank you very much.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
V(Applause ends)
p288
aVFor my next number \u2014
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
Vwhile I mentally recharge my batteries,
p293
aVI have one more question for the audience.
p294
aVBy any chance, does anybody here happen to know
p295
aVthe day of the week that they were born on?
p296
aVIf you think you know your birth day, raise your hand.
p297
aVLet's see, starting with \u2014 let's start with a gentleman first.
p298
aVWhat year was it, first of all?
p299
aVThat's why I pick a gentleman first.
p300
aa(lp301
VAudience: 1953.
p302
aa(lp303
V1953, and the month?
p304
aVNovember what?
p305
aV23rd \u2014 was that a Monday?
p306
aa(lp307
VAudience: Yes.
p308
aa(lp309
VGood. Somebody else?
p310
aVI haven't seen any women's hands up.
p311
aVOK, how about you, what year?
p312
aV1949, and the month?
p313
aVOctober what?
p314
aVFifth \u2014 was that a Wednesday?
p315
aVYes! I'll go way to the back right now, how about you?
p316
aVYell it out, what year?
p317
aa(lp318
VAudience: 1959.
p319
aa(lp320
V1959, OK \u2014 and the month?
p321
aa(lp322
VAudience: February.
p323
aVFebruary what?
p324
aa(lp325
VSixth \u2014 was that a Friday? Audience: Yes.
p326
aa(lp327
VGood, how about the person behind her?
p328
aVCall out, what year was it?
p329
aa(lp330
VAudience: 1947. AB: 1947, and the month?
p331
aa(lp332
VAudience: May. AB: May what?
p333
aa(lp334
VSeventh \u2014 would that be a Wednesday?
p335
aa(lp336
VAudience: Yes. AB: Thank you very much.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Applause)
p339
aa(lp340
VAnybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?
p341
aVWe can do it that way.
p342
aVOf course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know,
p343
aVso I come prepared for that.
p344
aVI brought with me a book of calendars.
p345
aVIt goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know.
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VI didn't mean to look at you, sir \u2014 you were just sitting there.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VAnyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind.
p354
aVThis is a book of calendars.
p355
aVWho wanted to know their birth day?
p356
aVWhat year was it, first of all?
p357
aa(lp358
VAudience: 1966.
p359
aa(lp360
V66 \u2014 turn to the calendar with 1966.
p361
aVAnd what month?
p362
aa(lp363
VAudience: April. AB: April what?
p364
aa(lp365
VAudience: 17th.
p366
aa(lp367
VI believe that was a Sunday.
p368
aVCan you confirm, Chris?
p369
aa(lp370
VChris Anderson: Yes.
p371
aa(lp372
VAB: I'll tell you what, Chris:
p373
aVas long as you have that book in front of you,
p374
aVdo me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s,
p375
aVeither into the 1800s or way into the 2000s \u2014
p376
aVthat'll be a much greater challenge for me.
p377
aVAB: What year would you like? CA: 1824.
p378
aa(lp379
VAB: 1824, OK.
p380
aVAB: And what month?
p381
aa(lp382
VCA: June.
p383
aa(lp384
VAB: June what? CA: Sixth.
p385
aa(lp386
VAB: Was that a Sunday?
p387
aa(lp388
VCA: It was. AB: And it was cloudy.
p389
aa(lp390
V(Laughter)
p391
aa(lp392
VGood, thank you very much.
p393
aa(lp394
V(Applause)
p395
aa(lp396
V(Applause ends)
p397
aa(lp398
VBut I'd like to wrap things up now
p399
aVby alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.
p400
aVThere was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.
p401
aVWhere is he, would you stand up,
p402
aV10-digit guy?
p403
aVOK, stand up for me just for a second,
p404
aVso I can see where you are.
p405
aVYou have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?
p406
aVOK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head
p407
aVa five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator.
p408
aVBut to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me,
p409
aVI'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.
p410
aVSo you can actually, honestly hear
p411
aVwhat's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size.
p412
aa(lp413
VNow, I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green.
p414
aVI know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets,
p415
aVbut I'm not too afraid
p416
aVthat people are going to start doing my show next week, so \u2014
p417
aVI think we're OK.
p418
aa(lp419
V(Laughter)
p420
aa(lp421
V(Applause)
p422
aa(lp423
VSo, let's see,
p424
aVlet's take a different row of people, starting with you.
p425
aVI'll get five digits: one, two, three, four.
p426
aVOh, I did this row already.
p427
aVLet's do the row before you,
p428
aVstarting with you: one, two, three, four, five.
p429
aVCall out a single digit \u2014
p430
aVthat will be the five-digit number that I will try to square, go ahead.
p431
aa(lp432
VFive.
p433
aa(lp434
VSeven.
p435
aa(lp436
VSix.
p437
aa(lp438
VEight.
p439
aa(lp440
VThree.
p441
aV57,683 \u2014
p442
aVsquared.
p443
aVYuck.
p444
aa(lp445
VLet me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.
p446
aVI'm going to break the problem down into three parts.
p447
aVI'll do 57,000 squared,
p448
aVplus 683 squared,
p449
aVplus 57,000 times 683 times two.
p450
aVAdd all those numbers together,
p451
aVand with any luck, arrive at the answer.
p452
aVNow, let me recap.
p453
aa(lp454
V(Laughter)
p455
aa(lp456
VThank you.
p457
aa(lp458
V(Laughter)
p459
aa(lp460
VWhile I explain something else \u2014
p461
aa(lp462
V(Laughter)
p463
aa(lp464
V\u2014 I know, that you can use, right?
p465
aa(lp466
V(Laughter)
p467
aa(lp468
VWhile I do these calculations,
p469
aVyou might hear certain words,
p470
aVas opposed to numbers, creep into the calculation.
p471
aVLet me explain what that is.
p472
aVThis is a phonetic code,
p473
aVa mnemonic device that I use,
p474
aVthat allows me to convert numbers into words.
p475
aVI store them as words, and later on retrieve them as numbers.
p476
aVI know it sounds complicated; it's not.
p477
aVI don't want you to think you're seeing something out of "Rain Man."
p478
aa(lp479
V(Laughter)
p480
aa(lp481
VThere's definitely a method to my madness \u2014
p482
aVdefinitely, definitely.
p483
aVSorry.
p484
aa(lp485
V(Laughter)
p486
aa(lp487
VIf you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards,
p488
aVyou can talk to me then.
p489
aVBy the way, one last instruction,
p490
aVfor my judges with the calculators \u2014
p491
aVyou know who you are \u2014
p492
aVthere is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here.
p493
aVIf I do, don't tell me what the mistake is;
p494
aVjust say, "you're close," or something like that,
p495
aVand I'll try and figure out the answer \u2014
p496
aVwhich could be pretty entertaining in itself.
p497
aVIf, however, I am right,
p498
aVwhatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK?
p499
aa(lp500
V(Laughter)
p501
aa(lp502
VMake sure everybody knows that I got the answer right,
p503
aVbecause this is my big finish, OK.
p504
aVSo, without any more stalling,
p505
aVhere we go.
p506
aVI'll start the problem in the middle, with 57 times 683.
p507
aV57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876,
p508
aVthat's 38,760 plus 171,
p509
aV38,760 plus 171 is 38,931.
p510
aV38,931; double that to get 77,862.
p511
aV77,862 becomes cookie fission,
p512
aVcookie fission is 77,822.
p513
aVThat seems right, I'll go on. Cookie fission, OK.
p514
aVNext, I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say,
p515
aVthree billion.
p516
aVTake the 249, add that to cookie, 249,
p517
aVoops, but I see a carry coming \u2014
p518
aV249 \u2014
p519
aVadd that to cookie, 250 plus 77,

aVis 327 million \u2014
p521
aVfission, fission, OK, finally, we do 683 squared,
p522
aVthat's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared
p523
aVis 466,489, rev up if I need it,
p524
aVrev up, take the 466,
p525
aVadd that to fission, to get,
p526
aVoh gee \u2014

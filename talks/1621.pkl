VLife is about opportunities \u2014 creating them and embracing them.
p5
aVAnd for me, that was the Olympic dream.
p6
aVThat's what defined me. That was my bliss.
p7
aa(lp8
VAs a cross-country skier and member of the Australian ski team
p9
aVheaded towards the Winter Olympics,
p10
aVI was on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates.
p11
aVAs we made our way up towards the spectacular Blue Mountains
p12
aVwest of Sydney,
p13
aVit was the perfect autumn day:
p14
aVsunshine, the smell of eucalypt and a dream.
p15
aVLife was good.
p16
aVWe'd been on our bikes for around five-and-a-half hours
p17
aVwhen we got to the part of the ride that I loved,
p18
aVand that was the hills, because I loved the hills.
p19
aVI got up off the seat of my bike and I started pumping my legs,
p20
aVand as I sucked in the cold mountain air, I could feel it burning my lungs,
p21
aVand I looked up to see the sun shining in my face.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd then everything went black.
p24
aVWhere was I? What was happening?
p25
aVMy body was consumed by pain.
p26
aVI'd been hit by a speeding utility truck
p27
aVwith only 10 minutes to go on the bike ride.
p28
aVI was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter
p29
aVto a large spinal unit in Sydney.
p30
aVI had extensive and life-threatening injuries.
p31
aVI'd broken my neck and my back in six places.
p32
aVI broke five ribs on my left side.
p33
aVI broke my right arm. I broke my collarbone.
p34
aVI broke some bones in my feet.
p35
aVMy whole right side was ripped open, filled with gravel.
p36
aVMy head was cut open across the front, lifted back,
p37
aVexposing the skull underneath.
p38
aVI had head injures. I had internal injuries.
p39
aVI had massive blood loss.
p40
aVIn fact, I lost about five liters of blood,
p41
aVwhich is all someone my size would actually hold.
p42
aVBy the time the helicopter arrived at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney,
p43
aVmy blood pressure was 40 over nothing.
p44
aVI was having a really bad day.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VFor over 10 days, I drifted between two dimensions.
p49
aVI had an awareness of being in my body,
p50
aVbut also being out of my body, somewhere else,
p51
aVwatching from above, as if it was happening to someone else.
p52
aVWhy would I want to go back to a body that was so broken?
p53
aa(lp54
VBut this voice kept calling me:
p55
aV"Come on, stay with me."
p56
aa(lp57
V"No, it's too hard."
p58
aa(lp59
V"Come on. This is our opportunity."
p60
aa(lp61
V"No. That body is broken. It can no longer serve me."
p62
aa(lp63
V"Come on. Stay with me. We can do it. We can do it together."
p64
aa(lp65
VI was at a crossroads.
p66
aVI knew if I didn't return to my body, I'd have to leave this world forever.
p67
aVIt was the fight of my life.
p68
aVAfter 10 days, I made the decision to return to my body.
p69
aVAnd the internal bleeding stopped.
p70
aa(lp71
VThe next concern was whether I would walk again,
p72
aVbecause I was paralyzed from the waist down.
p73
aVThey said to my parents that the neck break was a stable fracture,
p74
aVbut the back was completely crushed:
p75
aVthe vertebra at L1 was like you'd dropped a peanut,
p76
aVstepped on it, smashed it into thousands of pieces.
p77
aVThey'd have to operate.
p78
aVThey went in. They put me on a beanbag.
p79
aVThey cut me \u2014 literally cut me in half.
p80
aVI have a scar that wraps around my entire body.
p81
aVThey picked as much broken bone as they could
p82
aVthat had lodged in my spinal cord.
p83
aVThey took out two of my broken ribs and they rebuilt my back \u2014
p84
aVL1, they rebuilt it, they took out another broken rib,
p85
aVthey fused T12, L1 and L2 together.
p86
aVThen they stitched me up; they took an entire hour to stitch me up.
p87
aVI woke up in intensive care,
p88
aVand the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success,
p89
aVbecause at that stage, I had a little bit of movement
p90
aVin one of my big toes,
p91
aVand I thought, "Great, because I'm going to the Olympics!"
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VI had no idea.
p96
aVThat's the sort of thing that happens to someone else, not me, surely.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut then the doctor came over to me and she said,
p99
aV"Janine, the operation was a success,
p100
aVand we've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could.
p101
aVBut the damage is permanent.
p102
aVThe central nervous system nerves \u2014 there is no cure.
p103
aVYou're what we call a partial paraplegic,
p104
aVand you'll have all of the injuries that go along with that.
p105
aVYou'll have no feeling from the waist down,
p106
aVand at most, you might get 10 or 20 percent return.
p107
aVYou'll have internal injuries for the rest of your life.
p108
aVYou'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life.
p109
aVAnd if you walk again, it will be with calipers and a walking frame."
p110
aVAnd then she said,
p111
aV"Janine, you'll have to rethink everything you do in your life,
p112
aVbecause you're never going to be able to do the things you did before."
p113
aa(lp114
V(Gasps)
p115
aa(lp116
VI tried to grasp what she was saying.
p117
aVI was an athlete. That's all I knew. That's all I'd done.
p118
aVIf I couldn't do that, then what could I do?
p119
aVAnd the question I asked myself is:
p120
aVIf I couldn't do that,
p121
aVthen who was I?
p122
aa(lp123
VThey moved me from intensive care to acute spinal.
p124
aVI was lying on a thin, hard spinal bed.
p125
aVI had no movement in my legs.
p126
aVI had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots.
p127
aVI had one arm in plaster, one arm tied down by drips.
p128
aVI had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head
p129
aVand I saw my world through a mirror
p130
aVthat was suspended above my head.
p131
aVI shared the ward with five other people,
p132
aVand the amazing thing is,
p133
aVbecause we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward,
p134
aVwe didn't know what each other looked like.
p135
aVHow amazing is that?
p136
aVHow often in life do you get to make friendships, judgment-free,
p137
aVpurely based on spirit?
p138
aVAnd there were no superficial conversations
p139
aVas we shared our innermost thoughts, our fears,
p140
aVand our hopes for life after the spinal ward.
p141
aa(lp142
VI remember one night, one of the nurses came in, Jonathan,
p143
aVwith a whole lot of plastic straws.
p144
aVHe put a pile on top of each of us, and he said,
p145
aV"Start threading them together."
p146
aVWell, there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward, so we did.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd when we'd finished, he went around silently
p151
aVand he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward.
p152
aVAnd then he said,
p153
aV"OK everybody, hold on to your straws."
p154
aVAnd we did. And he said, "Right ...
p155
aVNow we're all connected."
p156
aVAnd as we held on and we breathed as one,
p157
aVwe knew we weren't on this journey alone.
p158
aVAnd even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward ...
p159
aVthere were moments of incredible depth and richness,
p160
aVof authenticity and connection
p161
aVthat I had never experienced before.
p162
aVAnd each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward,
p163
aVwe would never be the same.
p164
aa(lp165
VAfter six months, it was time to go home.
p166
aVI remember Dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair,
p167
aVwrapped in a plaster body cast,
p168
aVand feeling the sun on my face for the first time.
p169
aVI soaked it up and I thought,
p170
aV"How could I ever have taken this for granted?"
p171
aVI felt so incredibly grateful for my life.
p172
aVBut before I left hospital,
p173
aVthe head nurse had said to me, "Janine, I want you to be ready,
p174
aVbecause when you get home, something's going to happen."
p175
aVAnd I said, "What?"
p176
aVAnd she said, "You're going to get depressed."
p177
aVAnd I said, "Not me, not Janine the Machine,"
p178
aVwhich was my nickname.
p179
aVShe said, "You are, because, see, it happens to everyone.
p180
aVIn the spinal ward, that's normal. You're in a wheelchair. That's normal.
p181
aVBut you're going to get home and realize how different life is."
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd I got home.
p184
aVAnd something happened.
p185
aVI realized Sister Sam was right.
p186
aVI did get depressed.
p187
aVI was in my wheelchair.
p188
aVI had no feeling from the waist down,
p189
aVattached to a catheter bottle.
p190
aVI couldn't walk.
p191
aVI'd lost so much weight in hospital,
p192
aVI now weighed about 80 pounds.
p193
aVAnd I wanted to give up.
p194
aVAll I wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door.
p195
aVI wanted my old life back. I wanted my body back.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd I can remember Mom sitting on the end of my bed
p198
aVand saying, "I wonder if life will ever be good again."
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd I thought, "How could it?
p201
aVBecause I've lost everything that I valued,
p202
aVeverything that I'd worked towards.
p203
aVGone."
p204
aVAnd the question I asked was, "Why me? Why me?"
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd then I remembered
p207
aVmy friends that were still in the spinal ward,
p208
aVparticularly Maria.
p209
aVMaria was in a car accident,
p210
aVand she woke up on her 16th birthday
p211
aVto the news that she was a complete quadriplegic,
p212
aVhad no movement from the neck down,
p213
aVhad damage to her vocal chords, and she couldn't talk.
p214
aVThey told me, "We're going to move you next to her
p215
aVbecause we think it will be good for her."
p216
aVI was worried. I didn't know how I'd react to being next to her.
p217
aVI knew it would be challenging, but it was actually a blessing,
p218
aVbecause Maria always smiled.
p219
aVShe was always happy, and even when she began to talk again,
p220
aValbeit difficult to understand, she never complained, not once.
p221
aVAnd I wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd I realized that this wasn't just my life;
p224
aVit was life itself.
p225
aVI realized that this wasn't just my pain; it was everybody's pain.
p226
aVAnd then I knew, just like before,
p227
aVthat I had a choice: I could keep fighting this,
p228
aVor I could let go and accept not only my body,
p229
aVbut the circumstances of my life.
p230
aVAnd then I stopped asking, "Why me?"
p231
aVAnd I started to ask, "Why not me?"
p232
aVAnd then I thought to myself,
p233
aVmaybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start.
p234
aa(lp235
VI had never before thought of myself as a creative person.
p236
aVI was an athlete; my body was a machine.
p237
aVBut now I was about to embark on the most creative project
p238
aVthat any of us could ever do:
p239
aVthat of rebuilding a life.
p240
aVAnd even though I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do,
p241
aVin that uncertainty came a sense of freedom.
p242
aVI was no longer tied to a set path.
p243
aVI was free to explore life's infinite possibilities.
p244
aVAnd that realization was about to change my life.
p245
aa(lp246
VSitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast,
p247
aVan airplane flew overhead.
p248
aVI looked up, and I thought to myself, "That's it!
p249
aVIf I can't walk, then I might as well fly."
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VI said, "Mom, I'm going to learn how to fly."
p254
aVShe said, "That's nice, dear."
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VI said, "Pass me the yellow pages."
p259
aVShe passed me the phone book, I rang up the flying school,
p260
aVI said I'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight.
p261
aVThey said, "When do you want to come out?"
p262
aVI said, "Well, I have to get a friend to drive me because I can't drive.
p263
aVSort of can't walk, either. Is that a problem?"
p264
aVI made a booking, and weeks later,
p265
aVmy friend Chris and my mom drove me out to the airport,
p266
aVall 80 pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast
p267
aVin a baggy pair of overalls.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VI can tell you, I did not look like the ideal candidate
p272
aVto get a pilot's license.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VI'm holding on to the counter because I can't stand.
p277
aVI said, "Hi, I'm here for a flying lesson."
p278
aVThey took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws.
p279
aV"You get her." "No, no, you take her."
p280
aVFinally a guy goes, "Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm going to take you flying."
p281
aVI go, "Great!"
p282
aVThey get me out on the tarmac,
p283
aVand there was this red, white and blue airplane \u2014 it was beautiful.
p284
aVThey had to slide me up on the wing to put me in the cockpit.
p285
aVThey sat me down. There are buttons and dials everywhere.
p286
aVI'm going, "Wow, how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do?"
p287
aVAndrew got in the front, started the plane, and said,
p288
aV"Would you like to have a go at taxiing?"
p289
aVThat's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals
p290
aVto control the airplane on the ground.
p291
aVI said, "No, I can't use my legs."
p292
aVHe went, "Oh."
p293
aVI said, "But I can use my hands," and he said, "OK."
p294
aa(lp295
VSo he got over to the runway, and he applied the power.
p296
aVAnd as we took off down the runway,
p297
aVand the wheels lifted up off the tarmac, and we became airborne,
p298
aVI had the most incredible sense of freedom.
p299
aVAnd Andrew said to me,
p300
aVas we got over the training area,
p301
aV"You see that mountain over there?"
p302
aVAnd I said, "Yeah."
p303
aVAnd he said, "Well, you take the controls, and you fly towards that mountain."
p304
aVAnd as I looked up, I realized
p305
aVthat he was pointing towards the Blue Mountains,
p306
aVwhere the journey had begun.
p307
aVAnd I took the controls,
p308
aVand I was flying.
p309
aVAnd I was a long, long way from that spinal ward.
p310
aVI knew right then that I was going to be a pilot.
p311
aVDidn't know how on Earth I'd ever pass a medical.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VBut I'd worry about that later, because right now, I had a dream.
p316
aVSo I went home, I got a training diary out, and I had a plan.
p317
aVAnd I practiced my walking as much as I could,
p318
aVand I went from the point of two people holding me up ...
p319
aVto one person holding me up ...
p320
aVto the point where I could walk around the furniture
p321
aVas long as it wasn't too far apart.
p322
aVAnd then I made great progression,
p323
aVto the point where I could walk around the house,
p324
aVholding onto the walls, like this.
p325
aVAnd Mom said she was forever following me,
p326
aVwiping off my fingerprints.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VBut at least she always knew where I was.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VSo while the doctors continued to operate
p335
aVand put my body back together again,
p336
aVI went on with my theory study.
p337
aVAnd then eventually, amazingly, I passed my pilot's medical,
p338
aVand that was my green light to fly.
p339
aVAnd I spent every moment I could out at that flying school,
p340
aVway out of my comfort zone,
p341
aVall these young guys that wanted to be Qantas pilots, you know,
p342
aVand little old hop-along me in first my plaster cast,
p343
aVand then my steel brace, my baggy overalls,
p344
aVmy bag of medication and catheters and my limp.
p345
aVThey use to look at me and think,
p346
aV"Oh, who is she kidding? She's never going to be able to do this."
p347
aVAnd sometimes I thought that, too.
p348
aVBut that didn't matter,
p349
aVbecause now there was something inside that burned
p350
aVthat far outweighed my injuries.
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd little goals kept me going along the way,
p353
aVand eventually I got my private pilot's license.
p354
aVThen I learned to navigate, and I flew my friends around Australia.
p355
aVAnd then I learned to fly an airplane with two engines
p356
aVand I got my twin-engine rating.
p357
aVAnd then I learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather,
p358
aVand got my instrument rating.
p359
aVAnd then I got my commercial pilot's license.
p360
aVAnd then I got my instructor rating.
p361
aVAnd then I found myself back at that same school
p362
aVwhere I'd gone for that very first flight,
p363
aVteaching other people how to fly ...
p364
aVjust under 18 months after I'd left the spinal ward.
p365
aa(lp366
V(Applause)
p367
aa(lp368
V(Applause ends)
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd then I thought, "Why stop there?
p371
aVWhy not learn to fly upside down?"
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VAnd I did, and I learned to fly upside down
p376
aVand became an aerobatics flying instructor.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
VAnd Mom and Dad? Never been up.
p381
aa(lp382
V(Laughter)
p383
aa(lp384
VBut then I knew for certain that although my body might be limited,
p385
aVit was my spirit that was unstoppable.
p386
aa(lp387
VThe philosopher Lao Tzu once said,
p388
aV"When you let go of what you are,
p389
aVyou become what you might be."
p390
aVI now know that it wasn't until I let go of who I thought I was
p391
aVthat I was able to create a completely new life.
p392
aVIt wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have ...
p393
aVthat I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me.
p394
aVI now know that my real strength
p395
aVnever came from my body.
p396
aVAnd although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically,
p397
aVwho I am is unchanged.
p398
aVThe pilot light inside of me was still alight,
p399
aVjust as it is in each and every one of us.
p400
aa(lp401
VI know that I'm not my body.
p402
aVAnd I also know that you're not yours.
p403
aVAnd then it no longer matters what you look like,
p404
aVwhere you come from, or what you do for a living.
p405
aVAll that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity
p406
aVby living our lives as the ultimate creative expression
p407
aVof who we really are,
p408
aVbecause we are all connected
p409
aVby millions and millions of straws.
p410
aVAnd it's time to join those up
p411
aVand to hang on.
p412
aVAnd if we are to move towards our collective bliss ...
p413
aVit's time we shed our focus on the physical
p414
aVand instead embrace the virtues of the heart.
p415
aa(lp416
VSo raise your straws if you'll join me.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Applause)
p419
aa(lp420
VThank you.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Applause)
p423
aa(lp424
VThank you.

VI'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago
p5
aVwhile writing an article for Italian Wired.
p6
aVI always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,
p7
aVbut I'd already finished editing the piece,
p8
aVand I realized that I had never once in my life
p9
aVlooked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find.
p10
aa(lp11
VLet me read you the entry.
p12
aV"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,
p13
aVstalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,
p14
aVrun-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,
p15
aVsenile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in
p16
aVcracked-up, counted-out;
p17
aVsee also hurt, useless and weak.
p18
aVAntonyms, healthy, strong, capable."
p19
aVI was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,
p20
aVit was so ludicrous,
p21
aVbut I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke,
p22
aVand I had to stop and collect myself
p23
aVfrom the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.
p24
aa(lp25
VYou know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus
p26
aVso I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?
p27
aVBut, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,
p28
aVwhen I would have been starting primary school
p29
aVand forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit
p30
aVand as related to the other kids and the world around me.
p31
aVAnd, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.
p32
aVI mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world
p33
aVthat perceived someone like me
p34
aVto have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,
p35
aVwhen in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures
p36
aVmy life has procured.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,
p39
aVexpecting to find a revision worth noting.
p40
aVHere's the updated version of this entry.
p41
aVUnfortunately, it's not much better.
p42
aVI find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling:
p43
aV"whole" and "wholesome."
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, it's not just about the words.
p46
aVIt's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.
p47
aVIt's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.
p48
aVOur language affects our thinking and how we view the world
p49
aVand how we view other people.
p50
aVIn fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,
p51
aVbelieved that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,
p52
aVbecause to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.
p53
aVSo, what reality do we want to call into existence:
p54
aVa person who is limited, or a person who's empowered?
p55
aVBy casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,
p56
aVwe might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.
p57
aVWouldn't we want to open doors for them instead?
p58
aa(lp59
VOne such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor
p60
aVat the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.
p61
aVHis name was Dr. Pizzutillo,
p62
aVan Italian American, whose name, apparently,
p63
aVwas too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,
p64
aVso he went by Dr. P.
p65
aVAnd Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties
p66
aVand had the very perfect disposition to work with children.
p67
aa(lp68
VI loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital,
p69
aVwith the exception of my physical therapy sessions.
p70
aVI had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises
p71
aVwith these thick, elastic bands \u2014 different colors,
p72
aVyou know \u2014 to help build up my leg muscles,
p73
aVand I hated these bands more than anything \u2014
p74
aVI hated them, had names for them. I hated them.
p75
aVAnd, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,
p76
aVwith Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,
p77
aVunsuccessfully, of course.
p78
aVAnd, one day, he came in to my session \u2014
p79
aVexhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions \u2014
p80
aVand he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,
p81
aVI think you're going to break one of those bands.
p82
aVWhen you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks."
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part
p85
aVto get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do
p86
aVbefore the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,
p87
aVbut what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence
p88
aVinto a new and promising experience for me.
p89
aVAnd I have to wonder today to what extent his vision
p90
aVand his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl
p91
aVshaped my own view of myself
p92
aVas an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.
p93
aa(lp94
VThis is an example of how adults in positions of power
p95
aVcan ignite the power of a child.
p96
aVBut, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,
p97
aVour language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,
p98
aVthe possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.
p99
aVOur language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,
p100
aVmany of which have been brought about by technology.
p101
aVCertainly, from a medical standpoint,
p102
aVmy legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,
p103
aVtitanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies
p104
aVthat are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,
p105
aVand move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them \u2014
p106
aVnot to mention social networking platforms
p107
aVallow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,
p108
aVso they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.
p109
aVSo, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now
p110
aVwhat has always been a truth:
p111
aVthat everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,
p112
aVand that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,
p115
aVbecause people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,
p116
aVand I'm going to make an admission:
p117
aVThis phrase never sat right with me,
p118
aVand I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,
p119
aVand I think I'm starting to figure out why.
p120
aVImplicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity"
p121
aVis the idea that success, or happiness,
p122
aVis about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience
p123
aVunscathed or unmarked by the experience,
p124
aVas if my successes in life have come about from an ability
p125
aVto sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,
p126
aVor what other people perceive as my disability.
p127
aVBut, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,
p128
aVwhether physically, emotionally or both.
p129
aVAnd I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.
p130
aVAdversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around
p131
aVin order to resume living our life.
p132
aVIt's part of our life.
p133
aVAnd I tend to think of it like my shadow.
p134
aVSometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,
p135
aVbut it's always with me.
p136
aVAnd, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.
p137
aa(lp138
VThere is adversity and challenge in life,
p139
aVand it's all very real and relative to every single person,
p140
aVbut the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,
p141
aVbut how you're going to meet it.
p142
aVSo, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,
p143
aVbut preparing them to meet it well.
p144
aVAnd we do a disservice to our kids
p145
aVwhen we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.
p146
aVThere's an important difference and distinction
p147
aVbetween the objective medical fact of my being an amputee
p148
aVand the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.
p149
aVAnd, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront
p150
aVis the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.
p151
aa(lp152
VIn our desire to protect those we care about
p153
aVby giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,
p154
aVor, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,
p155
aVwe have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall
p156
aVthat will actually disable someone.
p157
aVPerhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you
p158
aVand how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual
p159
aVthan the pathology itself.
p160
aa(lp161
VBy not treating the wholeness of a person,
p162
aVby not acknowledging their potency,
p163
aVwe are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.
p164
aVWe are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.
p165
aVSo we need to see through the pathology
p166
aVand into the range of human capability.
p167
aVAnd, most importantly, there's a partnership
p168
aVbetween those perceived deficiencies
p169
aVand our greatest creative ability.
p170
aVSo it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times
p171
aVas something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,
p172
aVbut instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.
p173
aVSo maybe the idea I want to put out there is
p174
aVnot so much overcoming adversity
p175
aVas it is opening ourselves up to it,
p176
aVembracing it,
p177
aVgrappling with it,
p178
aVto use a wrestling term,
p179
aVmaybe even dancing with it.
p180
aVAnd, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,
p181
aVwe're less burdened by the presence of it.
p182
aa(lp183
VThis year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,
p184
aVand it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,
p185
aVthat Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.
p186
aVTo paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,
p187
aVnor is it the most intelligent that survives;
p188
aVit is the one that is most adaptable to change.
p189
aVConflict is the genesis of creation.
p190
aVFrom Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that
p191
aVthe human ability to survive and flourish
p192
aVis driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict
p193
aVinto transformation.
p194
aVSo, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.
p195
aVAnd, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.
p196
aVMaybe that's what adversity gives us:
p197
aVa sense of self, a sense of our own power.
p198
aVSo, we can give ourselves a gift.
p199
aVWe can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.
p200
aVMaybe we can see it as change.
p201
aVAdversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.
p202
aa(lp203
VI think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves
p204
aVis this idea of normalcy.
p205
aVNow, who's normal?
p206
aVThere's no normal.
p207
aVThere's common, there's typical. There's no normal,
p208
aVand would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed?
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVI don't think so.
p211
aVIf we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy
p212
aVto one of possibility \u2014 or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous \u2014
p213
aVwe can release the power of so many more children,
p214
aVand invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnthropologists tell us that the one thing
p217
aVwe as humans have always required of our community members
p218
aVis to be of use, to be able to contribute.
p219
aVThere's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,
p220
aVcarried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,
p221
aVand perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people
p222
aVproved of value to the community.
p223
aVThey didn't view these people as broken and useless;
p224
aVthey were seen as rare and valuable.
p225
aa(lp226
VA few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up
p227
aVin that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,
p228
aVand I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.
p229
aVIt was summertime: I had shorts on.
p230
aVI hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins."
p231
aVAnd I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you."
p234
aa(lp235
VHe said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.
p236
aVI mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb."
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVOh, that guy.
p239
aVAnd, but of course, actually, it did click.
p240
aa(lp241
VThis man was Dr. Kean,
p242
aVa man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,
p243
aVbecause, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.
p244
aVAnd so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,
p245
aVso the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.
p246
aVAnd, because I was born without the fibula bones,
p247
aVand had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,
p248
aVhe had to be the bearer \u2014 this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.
p249
aa(lp250
VHe said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents
p251
aVthat you would never walk,
p252
aVand you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have
p253
aVor any kind of life of independence,
p254
aVand you've been making liar out of me ever since."
p255
aV(Laughter)
p256
aV(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VThe extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved
p259
aVnewspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,
p260
aVwhether winning a second grade spelling bee,
p261
aVmarching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,
p262
aVwinning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,
p263
aVand he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,
p264
aVmed students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.
p265
aVAnd he called this part of the course the X Factor,
p266
aVthe potential of the human will.
p267
aVNo prognosis can account for how powerful this could be
p268
aVas a determinant in the quality of someone's life.
p269
aVAnd Dr. Kean went on to tell me,
p270
aVhe said, "In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,
p271
aVand even if given a modicum of support,
p272
aVif left to their own devices, a child will achieve."
p273
aa(lp274
VSee, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking.
p275
aVHe understood that there's a difference between the medical condition
p276
aVand what someone might do with it.
p277
aVAnd there's been a shift in my thinking over time,
p278
aVin that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,
p279
aVif I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,
p280
aVI wouldn't have hesitated for a second.
p281
aVI aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.
p282
aVBut if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
p283
aVAnd it's because of the experiences I've had with them,
p284
aVnot in spite of the experiences I've had with them.
p285
aVAnd perhaps this shift in me has happened
p286
aVbecause I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me
p287
aVthan those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.
p288
aa(lp289
VSee, all you really need is one person
p290
aVto show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.
p291
aVIf you can hand somebody the key to their own power \u2014
p292
aVthe human spirit is so receptive \u2014 if you can do that
p293
aVand open a door for someone at a crucial moment,
p294
aVyou are educating them in the best sense.
p295
aVYou're teaching them to open doors for themselves.
p296
aVIn fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate"
p297
aVcomes from the root word "educe."
p298
aVIt means "to bring forth what is within,
p299
aVto bring out potential."
p300
aVSo again, which potential do we want to bring out?
p301
aa(lp302
VThere was a case study done in 1960s Britain,
p303
aVwhen they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.
p304
aVIt's called the streaming trials. We call it "tracking" here in the States.
p305
aVIt's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.
p306
aVAnd the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.
p307
aVWell, they took, over a three-month period,
p308
aVD-level students, gave them A's,
p309
aVtold them they were "A's," told them they were bright,
p310
aVand at the end of this three-month period,
p311
aVthey were performing at A-level.
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study,
p314
aVis that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's."
p315
aVAnd that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.
p316
aVThose who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.
p317
aVA crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.
p318
aVThe teachers didn't know a switch had been made.
p319
aVThey were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'"
p320
aVAnd that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit,
p323
aVa spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,
p324
aVit doesn't see beauty,
p325
aVit no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity
p326
aVand our innate ability to imagine.
p327
aVIf instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,
p328
aVto see beauty in themselves and others,
p329
aVto be curious and imaginative,
p330
aVthen we are truly using our power well.
p331
aVWhen a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities
p332
aVand new ways of being.
p333
aa(lp334
VI'd like to leave you with a poem
p335
aVby a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz
p336
aVthat my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,
p337
aVand the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words":
p338
aV"Every child has known God,
p339
aVnot the God of names,
p340
aVnot the God of don'ts,
p341
aVbut the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,
p342
aVsaying, 'Come dance with me.
p343
aVCome, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'"
p344
aa(lp345
VThank you.
p346
aV(Applause)

VI'm an Iranian-American Muslim female,
p5
aVlike all of you.
p6
aVAnd I'm also a social justice comedian,
p7
aVsomething that I insist is an actual job.
p8
aa(lp9
VTo explain what that is, let me tell you how I got here.
p10
aVI've performed all over the country.
p11
aVAnd let me tell you, America is majestic, right?
p12
aVIt's got breathtaking nature,
p13
aVwaffle houses
p14
aVand diabetes as far as the eye can see.
p15
aVIt is really something.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, the American population can be broken up
p18
aVinto three main categories:
p19
aVthere's mostly wonderful people,
p20
aVhaters
p21
aVand Florida.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VBesides Florida, the most troubling category here are the Haters.
p26
aVThey are a minority,
p27
aVbut they overcompensate by being extra loud.
p28
aVThey have the Napoleon complex of demographics,
p29
aVand yes, some of the men do wear heels.
p30
aa(lp31
VAs a social justice comedian,
p32
aVit's my goal to convert these haters,
p33
aVbecause they hate a lot of things, which leads to negative outcomes,
p34
aVlike racism, violence and Ted Nugent.
p35
aVThis is not an exhaustive list;
p36
aVI'm probably missing 3-7 items.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut the point is,
p39
aVwe have to reckon with the haters.
p40
aVBut there's variance within this group
p41
aVand it's not efficient to go after all of them, right?
p42
aVSo what I've done is created a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.
p43
aVI basically took all of the haters,
p44
aVI put them in a petri dish, like a scientist,
p45
aVand this is what I found.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VFirst off, we have the trolls.
p50
aVThese are your garden-variety digital haters.
p51
aVThey're the people who quit their jobs
p52
aVso they can post on YouTube videos all day long.
p53
aVThere's also the drive-by haters.
p54
aVNow, these people will be at a stoplight,
p55
aVthey'll wait for the light to turn green
p56
aVand when it does, they yell, "Go back to your own country!"
p57
aVNow back in the day, they would've actually gotten out of their cars
p58
aVand hated you to your face.
p59
aVBut they just don't make them like they used to \u2014
p60
aVwhich is another sign of the decline in America.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VThe next category
p65
aVis the mission-oriented-bigot- whose-group-affiliation-
p66
aVgives-them-cover-for-hating hater.
p67
aVThese guys like to hate via a seemingly nice organization,
p68
aVlike a church or a nonprofit,
p69
aVand they oftentimes like to speak in an old-timey voice.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut the group I'm most interested in is the swing hater.
p72
aVThe swing hater is sister to the swing voter \u2014
p73
aVthey just can't decide!
p74
aVThey're like ideological sluts
p75
aVwho move from hating to not hating.
p76
aVAnd they do it because they don't have enough information.
p77
aVThis is the group I like to target with social justice comedy.
p78
aVWhy comedy?
p79
aVBecause on a scale of comedy to brochure,
p80
aVthe average American prefers comedy, as you can see from this graph.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VComedy is very popular.
p85
aVAnd by the way,
p86
aVthis is a mathematically accurate graph,
p87
aVgenerated from fake numbers.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, the question is:
p92
aVWhy does social justice comedy work?
p93
aVBecause, first off, it makes you laugh.
p94
aVAnd when you're laughing, you enter into a state of openness.
p95
aVAnd in that moment of openness,
p96
aVa good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information,
p97
aVand if they're really skilled,
p98
aVa rectal exam.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VHere are some ground rules for social justice comedy:
p103
aVfirst off, it's not partisan.
p104
aVThis isn't political comedy, this is about justice,
p105
aVand no one is against justice.
p106
aVTwo, it's inviting and warm,
p107
aVit makes you feel like you're sitting inside of a burrito.
p108
aVThree, it's funny but sneaky,
p109
aVlike you could be hearing an interesting treatise
p110
aVon income inequality,
p111
aVthat's encased in a really sophisticated poop joke.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VHere's how I see social justice comedy working.
p116
aVA few years ago, I rounded up a bunch of Muslim-American comedians \u2014
p117
aVin a non-violent way \u2014
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd we went around the country
p122
aVto places like Alabama, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia \u2014
p123
aVplaces where they love the Muzzies \u2014
p124
aVand we did stand-up shows.
p125
aVWe called the tour "The Muslims Are Coming!"
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VWe turned this into a movie,
p130
aVand then after the movie came out,
p131
aVa known hate group spent 300,000 dollars
p132
aVon an anti-Muslim poster campaign
p133
aVwith the MTA \u2014 that's the New York City subway system.
p134
aVNow, the posters were truly offensive,
p135
aVnot to mentioned poorly designed \u2014
p136
aVI mean, if you're going to be bigoted,
p137
aVyou might as well use a better font.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VBut we decided, why not launch our own poster campaign
p142
aVthat says nice things about Muslims,
p143
aVwhile promoting the movie.
p144
aVSo myself and fellow comedian Dean Obeidallah
p145
aVdecided to launch the fighting-bigotry- with-delightful-posters campaign.
p146
aVWe raised the money, worked with the MTA for over 5 months,
p147
aVgot the posters approved,
p148
aVand two days after they were supposed to go up,
p149
aVthe MTA decided to ban the posters,
p150
aVciting political content.
p151
aa(lp152
VLet's take a look at a couple of those posters.
p153
aVHere's one.
p154
aVFacts about Muslims:
p155
aVMuslims invented the concept of a hospital.
p156
aVOK.
p157
aVFact: Grown-up Muslims can do more push-ups than baby Muslims.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VFact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VLet's take a look at another one.
p166
aVThe ugly truth about Muslims:
p167
aVthey have great frittata recipes.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow clearly, frittatas are considered political by the MTA.
p170
aVEither that, or the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light
p171
aVwas considered political \u2014 but it isn't.
p172
aVIt's about justice.
p173
aVSo we decided to change
p174
aVour fighting-bigortry- with-delightful-posters campaign
p175
aVand turn it into the fighting-bigotry- with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VSo basically, what I'm saying is a couple of dirt-bag comedians
p180
aVtook on a major New York City agency
p181
aVand the comedians won.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Applause and cheers)
p184
aa(lp185
VThank you.
p186
aVVictory was a very weird feeling.
p187
aVI was like, "Is this what blonde girls feel like all the time?
p188
aV'Cause this is amazing!"
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VHere's another example.
p193
aVI'm asked everywhere I go: "Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?"
p194
aVWe do. But OK, I'll take the bait.
p195
aVSo I decided to launch thedailydenouncer.com.
p196
aVIt's a website that denounces terrorism every day of the week,
p197
aVwhile taking the weekends off.
p198
aVLet's take a look at an example.
p199
aVThey generally appear as single-panel cartoons,
p200
aV"I denounce terrorism! I also denounce people who never fill the paper tray!"
p201
aVThe point of the website is that it denounces terrorism
p202
aVwhile recognizing that it's ridiculous
p203
aVthat we have to constantly denounce terrorism.
p204
aa(lp205
VBut if bigotry isn't your thing,
p206
aVsocial justice comedy is useful for all sorts of issues.
p207
aVFor example, myself and fellow comedian Lee Camp
p208
aVwent to the Cayman Islands to investigate offshore banking.
p209
aVNow, the United States loses something like 300 billion dollars a year
p210
aVin these offshore tax havens.
p211
aVNot to brag,
p212
aVbut at the end of every month,
p213
aVI have something like 5-15 dollars in disposable income.
p214
aVSo we walked into these banks in the Cayman Islands
p215
aVand asked if we could open up a bank account
p216
aVwith eight dollars and 27 cents.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VThe bank managers would indulge us for 30-45 seconds before calling security.
p221
aVSecurity would come out, brandish their weapons,
p222
aVand then we would squeal with fear and run away,
p223
aVbecause \u2014 and this is the last rule of social justice comedy \u2014
p224
aVsometimes it makes you want to take a dump in your pants.
p225
aa(lp226
VMost of my work is meant to be fun.
p227
aVIt's meant to generate a connection and laughter.
p228
aVBut yes, sometimes I get run off the grounds by security.
p229
aVSometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.
p230
aVSometimes I get voice mails saying that if I continue telling my jokes,
p231
aVthey'll kill me and they'll kill my family.
p232
aVAnd those death threats are definitely not funny.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut despite the occasional danger,
p235
aVI still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons.
p236
aVI mean, we've tried a lot of approaches to social justice,
p237
aVlike war and competitive ice dancing.
p238
aVBut still, a lot of things are still kind of awful.
p239
aVSo I think it's time we try and tell a really good poop joke.
p240
aa(lp241
VThank you.
p242

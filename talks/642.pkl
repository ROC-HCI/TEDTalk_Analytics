VThank you.
p5
aVTwo years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania.
p6
aVI spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations.
p7
aVIt was a simple machine that changed my life.
p8
aa(lp9
VBefore that time,
p10
aVI had never been away from my home
p11
aVin Malawi.
p12
aVI had never used a computer.
p13
aVI had never seen an Internet.
p14
aVOn the stage that day, I was so nervous.
p15
aVMy English lost,
p16
aVI wanted to vomit.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVI had never been surrounded by so many azungu,
p19
aVwhite people.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VThere was a story I wouldn't tell you then.
p23
aVBut well, I'm feeling good right now.
p24
aVI would like to share that story today.
p25
aVWe have seven children in my family.
p26
aVAll sisters, excepting me.
p27
aVThis is me with my dad when I was a little boy.
p28
aVBefore I discovered the wonders of science,
p29
aVI was just a simple farmer
p30
aVin a country of poor farmers.
p31
aVLike everyone else, we grew maize.
p32
aa(lp33
VOne year our fortune turned very bad.
p34
aVIn 2001 we experienced an awful famine.
p35
aVWithin five months all Malawians began to starve to death.
p36
aVMy family ate one meal per day, at night.
p37
aVOnly three swallows of nsima for each one of us.
p38
aVThe food passes through our bodies.
p39
aVWe drop down to nothing.
p40
aa(lp41
VIn Malawi, the secondary school,
p42
aVyou have to pay school fees.
p43
aVBecause of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school.
p44
aVI looked at my father
p45
aVand looked at those dry fields.
p46
aVIt was the future I couldn't accept.
p47
aa(lp48
VI felt very happy to be at the secondary school,
p49
aVso I was determined to do anything possible
p50
aVto receive education.
p51
aVSo I went to a library.
p52
aVI read books, science books, especially physics.
p53
aVI couldn't read English that well.
p54
aVI used diagrams and pictures
p55
aVto learn the words around them.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnother book put that knowledge in my hands.
p58
aVIt said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.
p59
aVPump water meant irrigation,
p60
aVa defense against hunger,
p61
aVwhich we were experiencing by that time.
p62
aVSo I decided I would build one windmill for myself.
p63
aVBut I didn't have materials to use,
p64
aVso I went to a scrap yard
p65
aVwhere I found my materials.
p66
aVMany people, including my mother,
p67
aVsaid I was crazy.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VI found a tractor fan,
p71
aVshock absorber, PVC pipes.
p72
aVUsing a bicycle frame
p73
aVand an old bicycle dynamo,
p74
aVI built my machine.
p75
aVIt was one light at first.
p76
aVAnd then four lights,
p77
aVwith switches, and even a circuit breaker,
p78
aVmodeled after an electric bell.
p79
aVAnother machine pumps water
p80
aVfor irrigation.
p81
aa(lp82
VQueues of people start lining up at my house
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVto charge their mobile phone.
p85
aV(Applause)
p86
aVI could not get rid of them.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVAnd the reporters came too,
p89
aVwhich lead to bloggers
p90
aVand which lead to a call from something called TED.
p91
aVI had never seen an airplane before.
p92
aVI had never slept in a hotel.
p93
aVSo, on stage that day in Arusha,
p94
aVmy English lost,
p95
aVI said something like,
p96
aV"I tried. And I made it."
p97
aa(lp98
VSo I would like to say something
p99
aVto all the people out there like me
p100
aVto the Africans, and the poor
p101
aVwho are struggling with your dreams.
p102
aVGod bless.
p103
aVMaybe one day you will watch this on the Internet.
p104
aVI say to you, trust yourself and believe.
p105
aVWhatever happens, don't give up.
p106
aVThank you.
p107
aV(Applause)

When he was 14, he built an electricity-producing windmill from spare parts and scrap, working from rough plans he found in a library book called <em>Using Energy</em> and modifying them to fit his needs. The windmill he built powers four lights and two radios in his family home.  </p><p>After reading about Kamkwamba on Mike McKay&#39;s blog <a href=\\"http://www.vdomck.org/2006/11/23/malawian-windmill/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Hactivate</a>   (which picked up the story from a local Malawi newspaper), TEDGlobal Conference Director Emeka Okafor spent several weeks tracking him down at his home in Masitala Village, Wimbe, and invited him to attend TEDGlobal on a fellowship. Onstage, Kamkwamba <a href=\\"/talks/william_kamkwamba_on_building_a_windmill.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">talked about his invention</a> and shared his dreams: to build a larger windmill to help with irrigation for his entire village, and to go back to school.  </p><p>Following Kamkwamba&#39;s moving talk, there was an <a href=\\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?p=1490\\" target=\\"_blank\\">outpouring of support</a>  for him and his promising work. Members of the TED community got together to help him improve his power system (by incorporating solar energy), and further his education through school and mentorships. Subsequent projects have included clean water, malaria prevention, solar power and lighting for the six homes in his family compound; a deep-water well with a solar-powered pump for clean water; and a drip irrigation system. Kamkwamba himself returned to school, and is now attending the African Leadership Academy, a new pan-African prep school outside  Johannesburg, South Africa.</p><p>Kamkwamba&#39;s story is documented in his autobiography,  <em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/boywhoharnessedwind\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind: Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope</a><em>.</em> </em>A&nbsp; documentary about Kamkwamba, called <a href=\\"http://movingwindmills.org/documentary\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>William and the </em></a><a href=\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arD374MFk4w\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Windmill</em></a>, won the Documentary Feature Grand Jury award at SXSW in 2013 (<a href=\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arD374MFk4w\\" target=\\"_blank\\">watch a trailer</a> ).

"whylisten": "<p>William Kamkwamba, from Malawi, is a born inventor. When he was 14, he built an electricity-producing windmill from spare parts and scrap, working from rough plans he found in a library book called <em>Using Energy</em> and modifying them to fit his needs. The windmill he built powers four lights and two radios in his family home.  </p><p>After reading about Kamkwamba on Mike McKay&#39;s blog <a href=\\"http://www.vdomck.org/2006/11/23/malawian-windmill/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Hactivate</a>   (which picked up the story from a local Malawi newspaper), TEDGlobal Conference Director Emeka Okafor spent several weeks tracking him down at his home in Masitala Village, Wimbe, and invited him to attend TEDGlobal on a fellowship. Onstage, Kamkwamba <a href=\\"/talks/william_kamkwamba_on_building_a_windmill.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">talked about his invention</a> and shared his dreams: to build a larger windmill to help with irrigation for his entire village, and to go back to school.  </p><p>Following Kamkwamba&#39;s moving talk, there was an <a href=\\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?p=1490\\" target=\\"_blank\\">outpouring of support</a>  for him and his promising work. Members of the TED community got together to help him improve his power system (by incorporating solar energy), and further his education through school and mentorships. Subsequent projects have included clean water, malaria prevention, solar power and lighting for the six homes in his family compound; a deep-water well with a solar-powered pump for clean water; and a drip irrigation system. Kamkwamba himself returned to school, and is now attending the African Leadership Academy, a new pan-African prep school outside  Johannesburg, South Africa.</p><p>Kamkwamba&#39;s story is documented in his autobiography,  <em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/boywhoharnessedwind\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind: Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope</a><em>.</em> </em>A&nbsp; documentary about Kamkwamba, called <a href=\\"http://movingwindmills.org/documentary\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>William and the </em></a><a href=\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arD374MFk4w\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Windmill</em></a>, won the Documentary Feature Grand Jury award at SXSW in 2013 (<a href=\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arD374MFk4w\\" target=\\"_blank\\">watch a trailer</a> ).

VLet me begin with four words
p5
aVthat will provide the context for this week,
p6
aVfour words that will come to define
p7
aVthis century.
p8
aVHere they are:
p9
aVThe Earth is full.
p10
aVIt's full of us, it's full of our stuff,
p11
aVfull of our waste, full of our demands.
p12
aVYes, we are a brilliant and creative species,
p13
aVbut we've created a little too much stuff \u2014
p14
aVso much that our economy is now bigger
p15
aVthan its host, our planet.
p16
aa(lp17
VThis is not a philosophical statement,
p18
aVthis is just science
p19
aVbased in physics,
p20
aVchemistry and biology.
p21
aVThere are many science-based analyses of this,
p22
aVbut they all draw the same conclusion \u2014
p23
aVthat we're living beyond our means.
p24
aVThe eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network, for example,
p25
aVcalculate that we need about 1.5 Earths
p26
aVto sustain this economy.
p27
aVIn other words,
p28
aVto keep operating at our current level,
p29
aVwe need 50 percent more Earth than we've got.
p30
aVIn financial terms,
p31
aVthis would be like always spending 50 percent more than you earn,
p32
aVgoing further into debt every year.
p33
aVBut of course, you can't borrow natural resources,
p34
aVso we're burning through our capital,
p35
aVor stealing from the future.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo when I say full, I mean really full \u2014
p38
aVwell past any margin for error,
p39
aVwell past any dispute
p40
aVabout methodology.
p41
aVWhat this means is our economy is unsustainable.
p42
aVI'm not saying it's not nice or pleasant
p43
aVor that it's bad for polar bears or forests,
p44
aVthough it certainly is.
p45
aVWhat I'm saying
p46
aVis our approach is simply unsustainable.
p47
aVIn other words, thanks to those pesky laws of physics,
p48
aVwhen things aren't sustainable, they stop.
p49
aVBut that's not possible, you might think.
p50
aVWe can't stop economic growth.
p51
aVBecause that's what will stop: economic growth.
p52
aVIt will stop because of the end of trade resources.
p53
aVIt will stop because of the growing demand of us
p54
aVon all the resources, all the capacity,
p55
aVall the systems of the Earth,
p56
aVwhich is now having economic damage.
p57
aa(lp58
VWhen we think about economic growth stopping,
p59
aVwe go, "That's not possible,"
p60
aVbecause economic growth is so essential to our society
p61
aVthat is is rarely questioned.
p62
aVAlthough growth has certainly delivered many benefits,
p63
aVit is an idea so essential
p64
aVthat we tend not to understand
p65
aVthe possibility of it not being around.
p66
aVEven though it has delivered many benefits,
p67
aVit is based on a crazy idea \u2014
p68
aVthe crazy idea being
p69
aVthat we can have infinite growth
p70
aVon a finite planet.
p71
aVAnd I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes.
p72
aVThat the crazy idea is just that,
p73
aVit is crazy,
p74
aVand with the Earth full, it's game over.
p75
aa(lp76
VCome on, you're thinking.
p77
aVThat's not possible.
p78
aVTechnology is amazing. People are innovative.
p79
aVThere are so many ways we can improve the way we do things.
p80
aVWe can surely sort this out.
p81
aVThat's all true.
p82
aVWell, it's mostly true.
p83
aVWe are certainly amazing,
p84
aVand we regularly solve complex problems
p85
aVwith amazing creativity.
p86
aVSo if our problem
p87
aVwas to get the human economy down
p88
aVfrom 150 percent to 100 percent of the Earth's capacity,
p89
aVwe could do that.
p90
aVThe problem is we're just warming up
p91
aVthis growth engine.
p92
aVWe plan to take this highly-stressed economy
p93
aVand make it twice as big
p94
aVand then make it four times as big \u2014
p95
aVnot in some distant future,
p96
aVbut in less than 40 years,
p97
aVin the life time of most of you.
p98
aVChina plans to be there in just 20 years.
p99
aVThe only problem with this plan
p100
aVis that it's not possible.
p101
aa(lp102
VIn response, some people argue,
p103
aVbut we need growth, we need it to solve poverty.
p104
aVWe need it to develop technology.
p105
aVWe need it to keep social stability.
p106
aVI find this argument fascinating,
p107
aVas though we can kind of bend the rules of physics
p108
aVto suit our needs.
p109
aVIt's like the Earth doesn't care what we need.
p110
aVMother nature doesn't negotiate;
p111
aVshe just sets rules and describes consequences.
p112
aVAnd these are not esoteric limits.
p113
aVThis is about food and water, soil and climate,
p114
aVthe basic practical and economic foundations
p115
aVof our lives.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo the idea that we can smoothly transition
p118
aVto a highly-efficient,
p119
aVsolar-powered, knowledge-based economy
p120
aVtransformed by science and technology
p121
aVso that nine billion people
p122
aVcan live in 2050
p123
aVa life of abundance and digital downloads
p124
aVis a delusion.
p125
aVIt's not that it's not possible to feed, clothe and house us all
p126
aVand have us live decent lives.
p127
aVIt certainly is.
p128
aVBut the idea that we can gently grow there
p129
aVwith a few minor hiccups
p130
aVis just wrong,
p131
aVand it's dangerously wrong,
p132
aVbecause it means we're not getting ready
p133
aVfor what's really going to happen.
p134
aa(lp135
VSee what happens when you operate a system
p136
aVpast its limits
p137
aVand then keep on going
p138
aVat an ever-accelerating rate
p139
aVis that the system stops working and breaks down.
p140
aVAnd that's what will happen to us.
p141
aVMany of you will be thinking,
p142
aVbut surely we can still stop this.
p143
aVIf it's that bad, we'll react.
p144
aVLet's just think through that idea.
p145
aVNow we've had
p146
aV50 years of warnings.
p147
aVWe've had science proving
p148
aVthe urgency of change.
p149
aVWe've had economic analysis pointing out
p150
aVthat, not only can we afford it,
p151
aVit's cheaper to act early.
p152
aVAnd yet, the reality is
p153
aVwe've done pretty much nothing to change course.
p154
aVWe're not even slowing down.
p155
aVLast year on climate, for example,
p156
aVwe had the highest global emissions ever.
p157
aVThe story on food, on water, on soil, on climate
p158
aVis all much the same.
p159
aa(lp160
VI actually don't say this in despair.
p161
aVI've done my grieving about the loss.
p162
aVI accept where we are.
p163
aVIt is sad,
p164
aVbut it is what it is.
p165
aVBut it is also time
p166
aVthat we ended our denial
p167
aVand recognized
p168
aVthat we're not acting, we're not close to acting
p169
aVand we're not going to act
p170
aVuntil this crisis hits the economy.
p171
aVAnd that's why the end of growth
p172
aVis the central issue
p173
aVand the event that we need to get ready for.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo when does this transition begin?
p176
aVWhen does this breakdown begin?
p177
aVIn my view, it is well underway.
p178
aVI know most people don't see it that way.
p179
aVWe tend to look at the world,
p180
aVnot as the integrated system that it is,
p181
aVbut as a series of individual issues.
p182
aVWe see the Occupy protests,
p183
aVwe see spiraling debt crises,
p184
aVwe see growing inequality,
p185
aVwe see money's influence on politics,
p186
aVwe see resource constraint, food and oil prices.
p187
aVBut we see, mistakenly, each of these issues
p188
aVas individual problems to be solved.
p189
aVIn fact, it's the system
p190
aVin the painful process of breaking down \u2014
p191
aVour system, of debt-fueled economic growth,
p192
aVof ineffective democracy,
p193
aVof overloading planet Earth,
p194
aVis eating itself alive.
p195
aa(lp196
VI could give you countless studies
p197
aVand evidence to prove this,
p198
aVbut I won't because, if you want to see it,
p199
aVthat evidence is all around you.
p200
aVI want to talk to you about fear.
p201
aVI want to do so because, in my view,
p202
aVthe most important issue we face
p203
aVis how we respond
p204
aVto this question.
p205
aVThe crisis is now inevitable.
p206
aVThis issue is, how will we react?
p207
aVOf course, we can't know what will happen.
p208
aVThe future is inherently uncertain.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut let's just think through what the science is telling us
p211
aVis likely to happen.
p212
aVImagine our economy
p213
aVwhen the carbon bubble bursts,
p214
aVwhen the financial markets recognize
p215
aVthat, to have any hope
p216
aVof preventing the climate spiraling out of control,
p217
aVthe oil and coal industries are finished.
p218
aVImagine China, India and Pakistan going to war
p219
aVas climate impacts
p220
aVgenerate conflict over food and water.
p221
aVImagine the Middle East without oil income,
p222
aVbut with collapsing governments.
p223
aVImagine our highly-tuned, just-in-time food industry
p224
aVand our highly-stressed agricultural system failing
p225
aVand supermarket shelves emptying.
p226
aVImagine 30 percent unemployment in America
p227
aVas the global economy is gripped
p228
aVby fear and uncertainty.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow imagine what that means for you,
p231
aVyour family, your friends,
p232
aVyour personal financial security.
p233
aVImagine what it means
p234
aVfor your personal security
p235
aVas a heavily armed civilian population
p236
aVgets angrier and angrier
p237
aVabout why this was allowed to happen.
p238
aVImagine what you'll tell your children
p239
aVwhen they ask you,
p240
aV"So, in 2012, Mom and Dad,
p241
aVwhat was it like
p242
aVwhen you'd had the hottest decade on record
p243
aVfor the third decade in a row,
p244
aVwhen every scientific body in the world was saying
p245
aVyou've got a major problem,
p246
aVwhen the oceans were acidifying,
p247
aVwhen oil and food prices were spiking,
p248
aVwhen they were rioting in the streets of London
p249
aVand occupying Wall Street?
p250
aVWhen the system was so clearly breaking down, Mom and Dad,
p251
aVwhat did you do, what were you thinking?"
p252
aa(lp253
VSo how do you feel
p254
aVwhen the lights go out
p255
aVon the global economy in your mind,
p256
aVwhen your assumptions about the future
p257
aVfade away
p258
aVand something very different emerges?
p259
aVJust take a moment
p260
aVand take a breath
p261
aVand think, what do you feel
p262
aVat this point?
p263
aVPerhaps denial.
p264
aVPerhaps anger.
p265
aVMaybe fear.
p266
aVOf course, we can't know what's going to happen
p267
aVand we have to live with uncertainty.
p268
aVBut when we think about the kind of possibilities I paint,
p269
aVwe should feel a bit of fear.
p270
aa(lp271
VWe are in danger, all of us,
p272
aVand we've evolved to respond to danger with fear
p273
aVto motivate a powerful response,
p274
aVto help us bravely face a threat.
p275
aVBut this time it's not a tiger at the cave mouth.
p276
aVYou can't see the danger at your door.
p277
aVBut if you look,
p278
aVyou can see it at the door of your civilization.
p279
aVThat's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on,
p280
aVbecause if we wait until the crisis takes hold,
p281
aVwe may panic and hide.
p282
aVIf we feel it now and think it through,
p283
aVwe will realize we have nothing to fear
p284
aVbut fear itself.
p285
aVYes, things will get ugly, and it will happen soon \u2014
p286
aVcertainly in our lifetime \u2014
p287
aVbut we are more than capable
p288
aVof getting through everything that's coming.
p289
aa(lp290
VYou see, those people that have faith
p291
aVthat humans can solve any problem,
p292
aVthat technology is limitless, that markets can be a force for good,
p293
aVare in fact right.
p294
aVThe only thing they're missing
p295
aVis that it takes a good crisis to get us going.
p296
aVWhen we feel fear and we fear loss
p297
aVwe are capable of quite extraordinary things.
p298
aVThink about war.
p299
aVAfter the bombing of Pearl Harbor, it just took four days
p300
aVfor the government to ban the production of civilian cars
p301
aVand to redirect the auto industry,
p302
aVand from there to rationing of food and energy.
p303
aVThink about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat
p304
aVand how a change that seemed impossible just gets done.
p305
aVThink about how an individual responds
p306
aVto a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness
p307
aVand how lifestyle changes
p308
aVthat previously were just too difficult
p309
aVsuddenly become relatively easy.
p310
aa(lp311
VWe are smart, in fact, we really are quite amazing,
p312
aVbut we do love a good crisis.
p313
aVAnd the good news, this one's a monster.
p314
aV(Laughter)
p315
aVSure, if we get it wrong,
p316
aVwe could face the end of this civilization,
p317
aVbut if we get it right,
p318
aVit could be the beginning of civilization instead.
p319
aVAnd how cool would it be
p320
aVto tell your grandchildren that you were part of that?
p321
aa(lp322
VThere's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way.
p323
aVScientists like James Hansen tell us
p324
aVwe may need to eliminate net CO2 emissions from the economy
p325
aVin just a few decades.
p326
aVI wanted to know what that would take,
p327
aVso I worked with professor Jorgen Randers from Norway
p328
aVto find the answer.
p329
aVWe developed a plan called "The One Degree War Plan" \u2014
p330
aVso named because of the level of mobilization and focus required.
p331
aVTo my surprise,
p332
aVeliminating net CO2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years
p333
aVis actually pretty easy and pretty cheap,
p334
aVnot very cheap,
p335
aVbut certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization.
p336
aVWe didn't calculate that precisely,
p337
aVbut we understand that's very expensive.
p338
aVYou can read the details,
p339
aVbut in summary, we can transform our economy.
p340
aVWe can do it with proven technology.
p341
aVWe can do it at an affordable cost.
p342
aVWe can do it with existing political structures.
p343
aVThe only thing we need to change
p344
aVis how we think and how we feel.
p345
aVAnd this is where you come in.
p346
aa(lp347
VWhen we think about the future I paint,
p348
aVof course we should feel a bit of fear.
p349
aVBut fear can be paralyzing or motivating.
p350
aVWe need to accept the fear and then we need to act.
p351
aVWe need to act
p352
aVlike the future depends on it.
p353
aVWe need to act like we only have one planet.
p354
aVWe can do this.
p355
aVI know the free market fundamentalists will tell you
p356
aVthat more growth, more stuff and nine billion people going shopping
p357
aVis the best we can do.
p358
aVThey're wrong.
p359
aVWe can be more,
p360
aVwe can be much more.
p361
aVWe have achieved remarkable things
p362
aVsince working out how to grow food some 10,000 years ago.
p363
aVWe've built a powerful foundation
p364
aVof science, knowledge and technology \u2014
p365
aVmore than enough to build a society
p366
aVwhere nine billion people
p367
aVcan lead decent, meaningful and satisfying lives.
p368
aVThe Earth can support that
p369
aVif we choose the right path.
p370
aa(lp371
VWe can choose this moment of crisis
p372
aVto ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution \u2014
p373
aVlike, what do we want to be when we grow up,
p374
aVwhen we move past this bumbling adolescence
p375
aVwhere we think there are no limits
p376
aVand suffer delusions of immortality?
p377
aVWell it's time to grow up,
p378
aVto be wiser, to be calmer,
p379
aVto be more considered.
p380
aVLike generations before us,
p381
aVwe'll be growing up in war \u2014
p382
aVnot a war between civilizations,
p383
aVbut a war for civilization,
p384
aVfor the extraordinary opportunity
p385
aVto build a society
p386
aVwhich is stronger and happier
p387
aVand plans on staying around
p388
aVinto middle age.
p389
aa(lp390
VWe can choose life over fear.
p391
aVWe can do what we need to do,
p392
aVbut it will take every entrepreneur,
p393
aVevery artist,
p394
aVevery scientist, every communicator,
p395
aVevery mother, every father, every child,
p396
aVevery one of us.
p397
aVThis could be our finest hour.
p398
aa(lp399
VThank you.

To have such a strong advocate of free markets as Friedman questioning the fundamentals of endless consumerism and growth provoked a very strong response. It also took my message to much larger global audience and led, among other things, to Chris Anderson\'s invitation for me to speak at TED. I first met Tom when we both attended the WEF meeting at Davos in the mid-1990s. On a long walk down the mountain we started a conversation about these issues that has continued for nearly 20 years.

I particularly like the way Friedman connects climate change, food prices and the dramatic upheavals in the Middle East since 2010. The interview also examines in more detail the important question of whether, when and how society could respond to the emerging environmental and resource crisis, using the historical example of World War II, where we responded far later than we should have, yet ultimately succeeded."}, {"is_pdf": false, "headline": "The Earth is Full", "link_url": "http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/08/opinion/gilding-earth-limits/index.html", "eyebrow": null, "label": "WATCH", "note": "Paul Gilding \\r\\nCNN, April 8, 2012", "position": null, "blurb": "This was a good example of how powerfully TED Talks can spread a message around the world.

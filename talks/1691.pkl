VChris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years
p5
aVof anti-poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for TED.
p6
aVThat's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VI said, "Chris, that would take a miracle."
p11
aa(lp12
VHe said, "Bono, wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex?"
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, yeah.
p15
aVThen I thought, let's go even further than 25 years.
p16
aVLet's go back before Christ, three millennia,
p17
aVto a time when, at least in my head, the journey for justice,
p18
aVthe march against inequality and poverty really began.
p19
aVThree thousand years ago,
p20
aVcivilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile,
p21
aVsome slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance,
p22
aVsmelling of sheep shit, I guess,
p23
aVproclaimed to the Pharaoh, sitting high on his throne,
p24
aV"We, your majesty-ness, are equal to you."
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd the Pharaoh replies, "Oh, no.
p27
aVYou, your miserableness, have got to be kidding."
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd they say, "No, no, that's what it says here
p30
aVin our holy book."
p31
aa(lp32
VCut to our century, same country, same pyramids,
p33
aVanother people spreading the same idea
p34
aVof equality with a different book.
p35
aVThis time it's called the Facebook.
p36
aVCrowds are gathered in Tahrir Square.
p37
aVThey turn a social network from virtual to actual,
p38
aVand kind of rebooted the 21st century.
p39
aVNot to undersell how messy and ugly
p40
aVthe aftermath of the Arab Spring has been,
p41
aVneither to oversell the role of technology,
p42
aVbut these things have given a sense of what's possible
p43
aVwhen the age-old model of power, the pyramid,
p44
aVgets turned upside down, putting the people on top
p45
aVand the pharaohs of today on the bottom, as it were.
p46
aVIt's also shown us that something as powerful
p47
aVas information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality,
p48
aVbecause facts, like people,
p49
aVwant to be free, and when they're free,
p50
aVliberty is usually around the corner,
p51
aVeven for the poorest of the poor \u2014
p52
aVfacts that can challenge cynicism
p53
aVand the apathy that leads to inertia,
p54
aVfacts that tell us what's working and,
p55
aVmore importantly, what's not, so we can fix it,
p56
aVfacts that if we hear them and heed them could help us
p57
aVmeet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made
p58
aVback in 2005,
p59
aVwhen he asked us to be that great generation
p60
aVthat overcomes that most awful offense to humanity,
p61
aVextreme poverty,
p62
aVfacts that build a powerful momentum.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo I thought, forget the rock opera,
p65
aVforget the bombast, my usual tricks.
p66
aVThe only thing singing today would be the facts,
p67
aVfor I have truly embraced by inner nerd.
p68
aVSo exit the rock star.
p69
aVEnter the evidence-based activist, the factivist.
p70
aa(lp71
VBecause what the facts are telling us
p72
aVis that the long, slow journey,
p73
aVhumanity's long, slow journey of equality,
p74
aVis actually speeding up.
p75
aVLook at what's been achieved.
p76
aVLook at the pictures these data sets print.
p77
aVSince the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium,
p78
aVthere are eight million more AIDS patients
p79
aVgetting life-saving antiretroviral drugs.
p80
aVMalaria: There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa
p81
aVthat have their death rates cut by 75 percent.
p82
aVFor kids under five, child mortality, kids under five,
p83
aVit's down by 2.65 million a year.
p84
aVThat's a rate of 7,256 children's lives saved each day.
p85
aVWow. Wow. (Applause)
p86
aa(lp87
VLet's just stop for a second, actually, and think about that.
p88
aVHave you read anything anywhere in the last week
p89
aVthat is remotely as important as that number? Wow.
p90
aVGreat news. It drives me nuts
p91
aVthat most people don't seem to know this news.
p92
aVSeven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them.
p93
aVThis is Michael and Benedicta,
p94
aVand they're alive thanks in large part
p95
aVto Dr. Patricia Asamoah \u2014 she's amazing \u2014
p96
aVand the Global Fund, which all of you financially support,
p97
aVwhether you know it or not.
p98
aVAnd the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs
p99
aVthat stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids.
p100
aVThis fantastic news didn't happen by itself.
p101
aVIt was fought for, it was campaigned for,
p102
aVit was innovated for.
p103
aVAnd this great news gives birth to even more great news,
p104
aVbecause the historic trend is this.
p105
aVThe number of people living in back-breaking,
p106
aVsoul-crushing extreme poverty has declined
p107
aVfrom 43 percent of the world's population in 1990
p108
aVto 33 percent by 2000
p109
aVand then to 21 percent by 2010.
p110
aVGive it up for that. (Applause)
p111
aVHalved. Halved.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, the rate is still too high \u2014 still too many people
p114
aVunnecessarily losing their lives.
p115
aVThere's still work to do.
p116
aVBut it's heart-stopping. It's mind-blowing stuff.
p117
aVAnd if you live on less than $1.25 a day,
p118
aVif you live in that kind of poverty,
p119
aVthis is not just data.
p120
aVThis is everything.
p121
aVIf you're a parent who wants the best for your kids \u2014 and I am \u2014
p122
aVthis rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope.
p123
aVAnd guess what? If the trajectory continues,
p124
aVlook where the amount of people living on $1.25 a day
p125
aVgets to by 2030.
p126
aVCan't be true, can it?
p127
aVThat's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues,
p128
aVwe get to, wow, the zero zone.
p129
aVFor number-crunchers like us,
p130
aVthat is the erogenous zone,
p131
aVand it's fair to say that I am, by now,
p132
aVsexually aroused by the collating of data.
p133
aVSo virtual elimination of extreme poverty,
p134
aVas defined by people living on less than $1.25 a day,
p135
aVadjusted, of course, for inflation from a 1990 baseline.
p136
aVWe do love a good baseline.
p137
aVThat's amazing.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow I know that some of you think this progress
p140
aVis all in Asia or Latin America or
p141
aVmodel countries like Brazil \u2014
p142
aVand who doesn't love a Brazilian model? \u2014
p143
aVbut look at sub-Saharan Africa.
p144
aVThere's a collection of 10 countries, some call them the lions,
p145
aVwho in the last decade have had a combination
p146
aVof 100 percent debt cancellation,
p147
aVa tripling of aid, a tenfold increase in FDI \u2014
p148
aVthat's foreign direct investment \u2014
p149
aVwhich has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources \u2014 that's local money \u2014
p150
aVwhich, when spent wisely \u2014 that's good governance \u2014
p151
aVcut childhood mortality by a third,
p152
aVdoubled education completion rates,
p153
aVand they, too, halved extreme poverty,
p154
aVand at this rate, these 10 get to zero too.
p155
aVSo the pride of lions
p156
aVis the proof of concept.
p157
aa(lp158
VThere are all kinds of benefits to this.
p159
aVFor a start, you won't have to listen
p160
aVto an insufferable little jumped-up Jesus like myself.
p161
aVHow about that? (Applause)
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd 2028, 2030? It's just around the corner.
p164
aVI mean, it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away.
p165
aV(Laughter) I hope. I'm hoping.
p166
aVMakes us look really young.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo why aren't we jumping up and down about this?
p169
aVWell, the opportunity is real, but so is the jeopardy.
p170
aVWe can't get this done until we really accept
p171
aVthat we can get this done.
p172
aVLook at this graph.
p173
aVIt's called inertia. It's how we screw it up.
p174
aVAnd the next one is really beautiful.
p175
aVIt's called momentum.
p176
aVAnd it's how we can bend the arc of history
p177
aVdown towards zero,
p178
aVjust doing the things that we know work.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo inertia versus momentum.
p181
aVThere is jeopardy, and of course,
p182
aVthe closer you get, it gets harder.
p183
aVWe know the obstacles that are in our way
p184
aVright now, in difficult times.
p185
aVIn fact, today in your capital, in difficult times,
p186
aVsome who mind the nation's purse want to cut
p187
aVlife-saving programs like the Global Fund.
p188
aVBut you can do something about that.
p189
aVYou can tell politicians
p190
aVthat these cuts [can cost] lives.
p191
aa(lp192
VRight now today, in Oslo as it happens,
p193
aVoil companies are fighting to keep secret
p194
aVtheir payments to governments
p195
aVfor extracting oil in developing countries.
p196
aVYou can do something about that too.
p197
aVYou can join the One Campaign,
p198
aVand leaders like Mo Ibrahim, the telecom entrepreneur.
p199
aVWe're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some
p200
aVof the wealth under the ground
p201
aVends up in the hands of the people living above it.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd right now, we know
p204
aVthat the biggest disease of all
p205
aVis not a disease. It's corruption.
p206
aVBut there's a vaccine for that too.
p207
aVIt's called transparency, open data sets,
p208
aVsomething the TED community is really on it.
p209
aVDaylight, you could call it, transparency.
p210
aVAnd technology is really turbocharging this.
p211
aVIt's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo let me tell you about the U-report,
p214
aVwhich I'm really excited about. It's 150,000 millennials
p215
aVall across Uganda, young people
p216
aVarmed with 2G phones, an SMS social network
p217
aVexposing government corruption
p218
aVand demanding to know what's in the budget
p219
aVand how their money is being spent.
p220
aVThis is exciting stuff.
p221
aa(lp222
VLook, once you have these tools,
p223
aVyou can't not use them.
p224
aVOnce you have this knowledge, you can't un-know it.
p225
aVYou can't delete this data from your brain,
p226
aVbut you can delete the cliched image
p227
aVof supplicant, impoverished peoples
p228
aVnot taking control of their own lives.
p229
aVYou can erase that, you really can,
p230
aVbecause it's not true anymore. (Applause)
p231
aa(lp232
VIt's transformational.
p233
aV2030? By 2030, robots,
p234
aVnot just serving us Guinness, but drinking it.
p235
aVBy the time we get there,
p236
aVevery place with a rough semblance of governance
p237
aVmight actually be on their way.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo I'm here to \u2014 I guess we're here
p240
aVto try and infect you with this virtuous, data-based virus,
p241
aVthe one we call factivism.
p242
aVIt's not going to kill you.
p243
aVIn fact, it could save countless lives.
p244
aVI guess we in the One Campaign would love you
p245
aVto be contagious, spread it, share it, pass it on.
p246
aVBy doing so, you will join us and countless others
p247
aVin what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken,
p248
aVthe ever-demanding journey of equality.
p249
aVCould we really be the great generation
p250
aVthat Mandela asked us to be?
p251
aVMight we answer that clarion call with science,
p252
aVwith reason, with facts,
p253
aVand, dare I say it, emotions?
p254
aVBecause as is obvious, factivists have feelings too.
p255
aa(lp256
VI'm thinking of Wael Ghonim, though.
p257
aVSome of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups
p258
aVbehind the Tahrir Square in Cairo.
p259
aVHe got thrown in jail for it,
p260
aVbut I have his words tattooed on my brain.
p261
aa(lp262
V"We are going to win because we don't understand politics.
p263
aVWe are going to win because we don't play their dirty games.
p264
aVWe are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda.
p265
aVWe are going to win because the tears
p266
aVthat come from our eyes actually come from our hearts.
p267
aVWe are going to win because we have dreams,
p268
aVand we're willing to stand up for those dreams."
p269
aa(lp270
VWael is right.
p271
aVWe're going to win
p272
aVif we work together as one,
p273
aVbecause the power of the people
p274
aVis so much stronger than the people in power.
p275
aa(lp276
VThank you.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Applause)
p279
aVThank you so much. (Applause)

There they spent several weeks helping with a famine relief project. The experience shocked him and ignited a determination to work for change. In Bono&#39;s own words, &quot;What are the blind spots of our age? It might be something as simple as our deep-down refusal to believe that every human life has equal worth&quot;. In 2005, the year of&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.makepovertyhistory.org/2005/index.shtml\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Make Poverty History</a>, Bono became one of the inaugural winners of the&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.tedprize.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">TED Prize</a>; he used his wish to raise awareness and inspire activism.</p><p>In 2002, he co-founded&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://data.d202.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">DATA</a> (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), which later became the advocacy and campaign organization,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.one.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">ONE</a>. Today ONE has more than 3 million members who pressure politicians around the world to improve policies to empower the poorest. Thanks to these efforts, along with those of partners and grassroots leaders in Africa, these policies have delivered results. For example, eight million people are now on life preserving antiretoviral medications, malarial death rates have been halved in eight target countries, 50 million more children are in school and 5.4 million lives have been saved through vaccines.</p><p>In 2006, Bono and Bobby Shriver launched&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.joinred.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">(RED)</a>&nbsp;to engage the private sector in the fight against AIDS in Africa. (RED) Partners direct a portion of their profits from (RED)-branded products, services and events directly to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In just six years, (RED) has contributed more than $200 million - every penny of which goes directly to HIV/AIDS programs with the goal of eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV. To date, (RED) dollars have helped the lives of more than 14 million people in Africa through education, testing, counseling, and treatment programs. </p><p>Bono also co-founded EDUN with his wife Ali.&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.edun.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">EDUN</a>&nbsp;is a global fashion brand which does business in an number of countries in Africa and beyond, sourcing materials and manufacturing clothing. In Uganda, EDUN is supporting over 8,000 farmers in their move from subsistence to sustainable business practices. &nbsp;</p>        <p>Granted knighthood in 2007 and dubbed a &quot;Man of Peace&quot; in 2008, Bono mobilized in 2010 following the devastating earthquake in Haiti, performing the song &quot;Stranded&quot; with bandmate The Edge -- and Rihanna and Jay-z -- during the for Hope for Haiti Now telethon. The event was watched by 83 million people in the United States alone and raised a reported $58 million for relief.</p><p>Bono&rsquo;s journey in activism spans a generation and where he is coming from, and above all where he is going, is something we should all pay close attention to.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "bono", "whotheyare": "Bono, the lead singer of U2, uses his celebrity to fight for social justice worldwide: to end hunger, poverty and disease, especially in Africa.

relentless, Bono has proven himself stunningly effective in encouraging and cajoling the world&#39;s most powerful leaders to take seriously the challenge of disease and hunger and seize the historic opportunity we now have to beat extreme poverty, especially in Africa, through technological innovation, smart aid, transparency and investments which put citizens in charge.&nbsp;</p><p>As lead singer of&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.u2.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">U2</a>, Bono performed at&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0261024/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Live Aid</a> in 1985, which inspired him to travel to Ethiopia with his wife, Ali. There they spent several weeks helping with a famine relief project. The experience shocked him and ignited a determination to work for change. In Bono&#39;s own words, &quot;What are the blind spots of our age? It might be something as simple as our deep-down refusal to believe that every human life has equal worth&quot;. In 2005, the year of&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.makepovertyhistory.org/2005/index.shtml\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Make Poverty History</a>, Bono became one of the inaugural winners of the&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.tedprize.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">TED Prize</a>; he used his wish to raise awareness and inspire activism.</p><p>In 2002, he co-founded&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://data.d202.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">DATA</a> (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), which later became the advocacy and campaign organization,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.one.org\\" target=\\"_blank\\">ONE</a>. Today ONE has more than 3 million members who pressure politicians around the world to improve policies to empower the poorest. Thanks to these efforts, along with those of partners and grassroots leaders in Africa, these policies have delivered results. For example, eight million people are now on life preserving antiretoviral medications, malarial death rates have been halved in eight target countries, 50 million more children are in school and 5.4 million lives have been saved through vaccines.</p><p>In 2006, Bono and Bobby Shriver launched&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.joinred.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">(RED)</a>&nbsp;to engage the private sector in the fight against AIDS in Africa. (RED) Partners direct a portion of their profits from (RED)-branded products, services and events directly to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In just six years, (RED) has contributed more than $200 million - every penny of which goes directly to HIV/AIDS programs with the goal of eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV. To date, (RED) dollars have helped the lives of more than 14 million people in Africa through education, testing, counseling, and treatment programs. </p><p>Bono also co-founded EDUN with his wife Ali.&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.edun.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">EDUN</a>&nbsp;is a global fashion brand which does business in an number of countries in Africa and beyond, sourcing materials and manufacturing clothing. In Uganda, EDUN is supporting over 8,000 farmers in their move from subsistence to sustainable business practices. &nbsp;</p>        <p>Granted knighthood in 2007 and dubbed a &quot;Man of Peace&quot; in 2008, Bono mobilized in 2010 following the devastating earthquake in Haiti, performing the song &quot;Stranded&quot; with bandmate The Edge -- and Rihanna and Jay-z -- during the for Hope for Haiti Now telethon. The event was watched by 83 million people in the United States alone and raised a reported $58 million for relief.</p><p>Bono&rsquo;s journey in activism spans a generation and where he is coming from, and above all where he is going, is something we should all pay close attention to.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "bono", "whotheyare": "Bono, the lead singer of U2, uses his celebrity to fight for social justice worldwide: to end hunger, poverty and disease, especially in Africa.

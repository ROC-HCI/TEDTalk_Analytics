VI grew up in New York City,
p5
aVbetween Harlem and the Bronx.
p6
aVGrowing up as a boy, we were taught
p7
aVthat men had to be tough, had to be strong,
p8
aVhad to be courageous, dominating \u2014
p9
aVno pain, no emotions,
p10
aVwith the exception of anger \u2014
p11
aVand definitely no fear;
p12
aVthat men are in charge,
p13
aVwhich means women are not;
p14
aVthat men lead,
p15
aVand you should just follow and do what we say;
p16
aVthat men are superior; women are inferior;
p17
aVthat men are strong; women are weak;
p18
aVthat women are of less value,
p19
aVproperty of men,
p20
aVand objects,
p21
aVparticularly sexual objects.
p22
aVI've later come to know that to be
p23
aVthe collective socialization of men,
p24
aVbetter known
p25
aVas the "man box."
p26
aVSee this man box has in it
p27
aVall the ingredients
p28
aVof how we define what it means to be a man.
p29
aVNow I also want to say, without a doubt,
p30
aVthere are some wonderful, wonderful,
p31
aVabsolutely wonderful things
p32
aVabout being a man.
p33
aVBut at the same time,
p34
aVthere's some stuff
p35
aVthat's just straight up twisted,
p36
aVand we really need to begin
p37
aVto challenge, look at it
p38
aVand really get in the process
p39
aVof deconstructing, redefining,
p40
aVwhat we come to know as manhood.
p41
aa(lp42
VThis is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.
p43
aVThey're 11 and 12.
p44
aVKendall's 15 months older than Jay.
p45
aVThere was a period of time when my wife \u2014 her name is Tammie \u2014 and I,
p46
aVwe just got real busy and whip, bam, boom:
p47
aVKendall and Jay.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVAnd when they were about five and six,
p50
aVfour and five,
p51
aVJay could come to me,
p52
aVcome to me crying.
p53
aVIt didn't matter what she was crying about,
p54
aVshe could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up,
p55
aVjust cry, cry it out.
p56
aVDaddy's got you. That's all that's important.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow Kendall on the other hand \u2014
p59
aVand like I said, he's only 15 months older than her \u2014
p60
aVhe'd come to me crying,
p61
aVit's like as soon as I would hear him cry,
p62
aVa clock would go off.
p63
aVI would give the boy probably about 30 seconds,
p64
aVwhich means, by the time he got to me,
p65
aVI was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?
p66
aVHold your head up. Look at me.
p67
aVExplain to me what's wrong.
p68
aVTell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.
p69
aVWhy are you crying?"
p70
aVAnd out of my own frustration
p71
aVof my role and responsibility
p72
aVof building him up as a man
p73
aVto fit into these guidelines
p74
aVand these structures that are defining this man box,
p75
aVI would find myself saying things like,
p76
aV"Just go in your room.
p77
aVJust go on, go on in your room.
p78
aVSit down,
p79
aVget yourself together
p80
aVand come back and talk to me
p81
aVwhen you can talk to me like a \u2014" what?
p82
aV(Audience: Man.)
p83
aVLike a man.
p84
aVAnd he's five years old.
p85
aVAnd as I grow in life,
p86
aVI would say to myself,
p87
aV"My God, what's wrong with me?
p88
aVWhat am I doing? Why would I do this?"
p89
aVAnd I think back.
p90
aVI think back to my father.
p91
aa(lp92
VThere was a time in my life
p93
aVwhere we had a very troubled experience in our family.
p94
aVMy brother, Henry, he died tragically
p95
aVwhen we were teenagers.
p96
aVWe lived in New York City, as I said.
p97
aVWe lived in the Bronx at the time,
p98
aVand the burial was in a place called Long Island,
p99
aVit was about two hours outside of the city.
p100
aVAnd as we were preparing
p101
aVto come back from the burial,
p102
aVthe cars stopped at the bathroom
p103
aVto let folks take care of themselves
p104
aVbefore the long ride back to the city.
p105
aVAnd the limousine empties out.
p106
aVMy mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out,
p107
aVbut my father and I stayed in the limousine,
p108
aVand no sooner than the women got out,
p109
aVhe burst out crying.
p110
aVHe didn't want cry in front of me,
p111
aVbut he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city,
p112
aVand it was better me than to allow himself
p113
aVto express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.
p114
aVAnd this is a man
p115
aVwho, 10 minutes ago,
p116
aVhad just put his teenage son
p117
aVin the ground \u2014
p118
aVsomething I just can't even imagine.
p119
aVThe thing that sticks with me the most
p120
aVis that he was apologizing to me
p121
aVfor crying in front of me,
p122
aVand at the same time, he was also giving me props,
p123
aVlifting me up,
p124
aVfor not crying.
p125
aa(lp126
VI come to also look at this
p127
aVas this fear that we have as men,
p128
aVthis fear that just has us paralyzed,
p129
aVholding us hostage
p130
aVto this man box.
p131
aVI can remember speaking
p132
aVto a 12-year-old boy, a football player,
p133
aVand I asked him, I said,
p134
aV"How would you feel if,
p135
aVin front of all the players,
p136
aVyour coach told you you were playing like a girl?"
p137
aVNow I expected him to say something like,
p138
aVI'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.
p139
aVNo, the boy said to me \u2014
p140
aVthe boy said to me,
p141
aV"It would destroy me."
p142
aVAnd I said to myself,
p143
aV"God, if it would destroy him
p144
aVto be called a girl,
p145
aVwhat are we then teaching him
p146
aVabout girls?"
p147
aa(lp148
V(Applause)
p149
aa(lp150
VIt took me back to a time
p151
aVwhen I was about 12 years old.
p152
aVI grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.
p153
aVAt this time we're living in the Bronx,
p154
aVand in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.
p155
aVHe was about 16 years old,
p156
aVand we were all about 12 years old \u2014 younger guys.
p157
aVAnd he was hanging out with all us younger guys.
p158
aVAnd this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.
p159
aVHe was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder,
p160
aV"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?"
p161
aVAnd he did spend a lot of time up to no good.
p162
aVHe was a troubled kid.
p163
aVHis mother had died from a heroin overdose.
p164
aVHe was being raised by his grandmother.
p165
aVHis father wasn't on the set.
p166
aVHis grandmother had two jobs.
p167
aVHe was home alone a lot.
p168
aVBut I've got to tell you, we young guys,
p169
aVwe looked up to this dude, man.
p170
aVHe was cool. He was fine.
p171
aVThat's what the sisters said, "He was fine."
p172
aVHe was having sex.
p173
aVWe all looked up to him.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something \u2014
p176
aVjust playing around, doing something \u2014 I don't know what.
p177
aVHe looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."
p178
aVThey called me Anthony growing up as a kid.
p179
aV"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."
p180
aVJohnny call, you go.
p181
aVSo I run right upstairs.
p182
aVAs he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"
p183
aVNow I immediately knew what he meant.
p184
aVBecause for me growing up at that time,
p185
aVand our relationship with this man box,
p186
aV"Do you want some?" meant one of two things:
p187
aVsex or drugs \u2014
p188
aVand we weren't doing drugs.
p189
aVNow my box, my card,
p190
aVmy man box card,
p191
aVwas immediately in jeopardy.
p192
aVTwo things: One, I never had sex.
p193
aVWe don't talk about that as men.
p194
aVYou only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life,
p195
aVthe first time you had sex.
p196
aVFor everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.
p197
aVThere ain't no first time.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aVThe other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.
p200
aVThat's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.
p201
aVWomen are objects,
p202
aVespecially sexual objects.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.
p205
aVSo, like my mother would say, make a long story short,
p206
aVI just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."
p207
aVHe told me to go in his room.
p208
aVI go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.
p209
aVShe's 16 years old.
p210
aVShe's nude.
p211
aVShe's what I know today to be mentally ill,
p212
aVhigher-functioning at times than others.
p213
aVWe had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.
p214
aVAnyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.
p215
aVWell actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.
p216
aVBecause, while Sheila never said no,
p217
aVshe also never said yes.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo he was offering me the opportunity to do the same.
p220
aVSo when I go in the room, I close the door.
p221
aVFolks, I'm petrified.
p222
aVI stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room
p223
aVand see that I'm not doing anything,
p224
aVand I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.
p225
aVSo now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do;
p226
aVI'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.
p227
aVSo in my 12 years of wisdom,
p228
aVI zip my pants down,
p229
aVI walk out into the room,
p230
aVand lo and behold to me,
p231
aVwhile I was in the room with Sheila,
p232
aVJohnny was back at the window calling guys up.
p233
aVSo now there's a living room full of guys.
p234
aVIt was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.
p235
aVAnd they asked me how was it,
p236
aVand I say to them, "It was good,"
p237
aVand I zip my pants up in front of them,
p238
aVand I head for the door.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow I say this all with remorse,
p241
aVand I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time,
p242
aVbut I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited,
p243
aVbecause I didn't get caught.
p244
aVBut I knew I felt bad about what was happening.
p245
aVThis fear, getting outside the man box,
p246
aVtotally enveloped me.
p247
aVIt was way more important to me,
p248
aVabout me and my man box card
p249
aVthan about Sheila
p250
aVand what was happening to her.
p251
aa(lp252
VSee collectively, we as men
p253
aVare taught to have less value in women,
p254
aVto view them as property and the objects of men.
p255
aVWe see that as an equation that equals violence against women.
p256
aVWe as men, good men,
p257
aVthe large majority of men,
p258
aVwe operate on the foundation
p259
aVof this whole collective socialization.
p260
aVWe kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.
p261
aVYou see, we have to come to understand
p262
aVthat less value, property and objectification is the foundation
p263
aVand the violence can't happen without it.
p264
aVSo we're very much a part of the solution
p265
aVas well as the problem.
p266
aVThe center for disease control says
p267
aVthat men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions,
p268
aVis the number one health concern for women
p269
aVin this country and abroad.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo quickly, I'd like to just say,
p272
aVthis is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.
p273
aVThe world I envision for her \u2014
p274
aVhow do I want men to be acting and behaving?
p275
aVI need you on board. I need you with me.
p276
aVI need you working with me and me working with you
p277
aVon how we raise our sons
p278
aVand teach them to be men \u2014
p279
aVthat it's okay to not be dominating,
p280
aVthat it's okay to have feelings and emotions,
p281
aVthat it's okay to promote equality,
p282
aVthat it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it,
p283
aVthat it's okay to be whole,
p284
aVthat my liberation as a man
p285
aVis tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
VI remember asking a nine-year-old boy,
p288
aVI asked a nine-year-old boy,
p289
aV"What would life be like for you,
p290
aVif you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"
p291
aVHe said to me, "I would be free."
p292
aa(lp293
VThank you folks.

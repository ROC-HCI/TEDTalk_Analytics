V"The Better Man."
p5
aa(lp6
VI was the better at getting and keeping.
p7
aa(lp8
VYou were the better at spend and spend;
p9
aa(lp10
VI was the better at grubbing and heaping,
p11
aa(lp12
VBut who was the better man in the end?
p13
aa(lp14
VYes, who was the better man, my friend?
p15
aa(lp16
VYou were the better with lords and ladies,
p17
aa(lp18
VI was the better at pillaging Troy;
p19
aa(lp20
VYou were the better at kissing the babies,
p21
aa(lp22
VI was the better at search and destroy.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut who was the better man, old boy?
p25
aa(lp26
VWho was the better man?
p27
aa(lp28
VI was the better at improvisation,
p29
aa(lp30
VYou were the better at spinning the plates;
p31
aa(lp32
VI was the better at procrastination,
p33
aa(lp34
VYou were the better at quiet debate.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut who was the better man, old mate?
p37
aa(lp38
VWho was the better man?
p39
aa(lp40
VYou were the better at rolling a reefer,
p41
aa(lp42
VI was the better at coke and rum;
p43
aa(lp44
VRemember that night on the beach in Ibiza?
p45
aa(lp46
VThe Maori twins
p47
aVwith the tattooed bum?
p48
aa(lp49
VBut who was the better man, old chum?
p50
aa(lp51
VWho was the better man?
p52
aa(lp53
VNow we come down to it, relatives grieving.
p54
aa(lp55
VOut in the hall with their crocodile tears;
p56
aa(lp57
VNow that you're out of it, now that you're leaving,
p58
aa(lp59
VNow that they've sealed your arse and your ears,
p60
aa(lp61
VWhat I've been meaning to tell you for years,
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd years, and years, and years, old friend ...
p64
aa(lp65
VIs that you were the better man, in the end;
p66
aa(lp67
VYou were the better man,
p68
aa(lp69
VMy friend.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Applause)
p72
aa(lp73
VI wrote this next poem for my mother.
p74
aVEvery one of us had a mother,
p75
aVonly one \u2014
p76
aVprobably the most important person in your life,
p77
aVif you're lucky enough to know them.
p78
aVMy mother was certainly the most important in mine.
p79
aVLet me try and describe her to you.
p80
aVShe's 86 years old. She's frail.
p81
aVWhite, platinum hair.
p82
aVWhy do they do that? Why do old ladies go to those hair shops,
p83
aVand make those helmets?
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVBright as a button. All the ducks in a row.
p86
aVLooks like a much prettier version
p87
aVof Margaret Thatcher,
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVbut without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVI wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs.
p92
aVBut my mother has lived by this creed
p93
aVall her life.
p94
aa(lp95
V"Never Go Back."
p96
aa(lp97
VNever go back. Never go back.
p98
aa(lp99
VNever return to the haunts of your youth.
p100
aa(lp101
VKeep to the track, to the beaten track;
p102
aa(lp103
VMemory holds all you need of the truth.
p104
aa(lp105
VNever look back. Never look back.
p106
aa(lp107
VNever succumb to the gorgon's stare.
p108
aa(lp109
VKeep to the track, to the beaten track;
p110
aa(lp111
VNo-one is waiting and nothing is there.
p112
aa(lp113
VNever go back. Never go back.
p114
aa(lp115
VNever surrender the future you earned.
p116
aa(lp117
VKeep to the track, to the beaten track;
p118
aa(lp119
VNever return to the bridges you've burned.
p120
aa(lp121
VNever look back. Never look back.
p122
aa(lp123
VNever retreat to the 'glorious past.'
p124
aa(lp125
VKeep to the track, to the beaten track;
p126
aa(lp127
VTreat every day of your life as your last.
p128
aa(lp129
VNever go back. Never go back.
p130
aa(lp131
VNever acknowledge the ghost on the stair.
p132
aa(lp133
VKeep to the track, to the beaten track;
p134
aa(lp135
VNo-one is waiting and nothing is there.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Applause)
p138
aa(lp139
VNow ladies and gentlemen, I'm up on me hobbyhorse.
p140
aVIf every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon
p141
aVwere tied end to end along a railroad track,
p142
aVthat would be me,
p143
aVstoking the train
p144
aVwithout a qualm in the world.
p145
aVLadies, don't do it.
p146
aVDon't do it.
p147
aVYou think we want you to do it, but we don't want you to do it.
p148
aVStop it.
p149
aVTell them to go to hell.
p150
aVYou bodies are wonderful as they are.
p151
aVJust leave them alone.
p152
aa(lp153
V"To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age."
p154
aa(lp155
VLady lady, do not weep.
p156
aa(lp157
VWhat is gone is gone. Now sleep.
p158
aa(lp159
VTurn your pillow. Dry your tears.
p160
aa(lp161
VCount thy sheep and not thy years.
p162
aa(lp163
VNothing good can come of this.
p164
aa(lp165
VTime rules all, my dearest.
p166
aa(lp167
V'Tis but folly to be waging war
p168
aa(lp169
VOn one who never lost before.
p170
aa(lp171
VLady, this is all in vain.
p172
aa(lp173
VYouth can never come again;
p174
aa(lp175
VWe have drunk the summer wine.
p176
aa(lp177
VNone can make a stitch in time.
p178
aa(lp179
VNip and tuck till crack of doom.
p180
aa(lp181
VWhat is foretold in the womb
p182
aa(lp183
VMay not be foresworn with gold.
p184
aa(lp185
VNor may time be bought or sold.
p186
aa(lp187
VDearest, do I love thee less?
p188
aa(lp189
VDo I shrink from thy caress?
p190
aa(lp191
VThink you I could cease to care?
p192
aa(lp193
VNever was there one so fair!
p194
aa(lp195
VLady lady, do not weep \u2014
p196
aa(lp197
VWhat is gone is gone. Now sleep.
p198
aa(lp199
VLean against me, calm your fears,
p200
aa(lp201
VCount thy blessings, not thy years.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Applause)
p204
aa(lp205
VAmerica, ladies and gentlemen, has done more for me financially than Britain
p206
aVever has, or ever could have done.
p207
aVI was born in Britain, as you have probably guessed.
p208
aVEven when on its worst behavior,
p209
aVI find myself automatically defending the USA
p210
aVfrom the sneers of green-eyed Europhiles
p211
aVplaying their Greek card to Roman trumps.
p212
aVAmerica is an empire.
p213
aVI hope you know that now.
p214
aVAll empires, by definition, are bumbling,
p215
aVshambolic, bullying, bureaucratic affairs,
p216
aVas certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy,
p217
aVas they are corrupted by power in their dotage.
p218
aVI am no historian, ladies and gentlemen.
p219
aVBut it seems to be that the USA's sins,
p220
aVcompared to those of many previous empires,
p221
aVare of a more moderate,
p222
aVif more pervasive, kind.
p223
aVLet me put this bluntly.
p224
aVIf Americans are so fat,
p225
aVstupid and ignorant,
p226
aVmy dear friends from Birmingham,
p227
aVhow come they rule the world?
p228
aa(lp229
V"Hail to the Gods of America."
p230
aa(lp231
VHail to the Gods of America!
p232
aa(lp233
VHail to the gods of the dream.
p234
aa(lp235
VInvictus E Pluribus Unum.
p236
aa(lp237
VBut which of them reigns supreme?
p238
aa(lp239
VWhich is America's Jupiter?
p240
aa(lp241
VThe Brahmins of Capital Hill?
p242
aa(lp243
VA sorcerer's profit on Wall Street?
p244
aa(lp245
VThey eye of a dollar bill?
p246
aa(lp247
VOr is it celebrity status?
p248
aa(lp249
VThe worship of those we hate.
p250
aa(lp251
VOr the cult of living forever,
p252
aa(lp253
VIf only we'd watch our weight.
p254
aa(lp255
VWhat of the titans of media?
p256
aa(lp257
VOr Hollywood's siren call?
p258
aa(lp259
VWhat of the temples of justice,
p260
aa(lp261
VWhose servants enslave us all?
p262
aa(lp263
VWhat of the Brand and the Label?
p264
aa(lp265
VWhat of the upstart Sport?
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd what of the Constitution,
p268
aa(lp269
VThat bully of last resort?
p270
aa(lp271
VHail to the God of America,
p272
aa(lp273
VWhose power the masses extol \u2014
p274
aa(lp275
VConvenience rules America;
p276
aa(lp277
VConvenience owns our soul.
p278
aa(lp279
VAye, that it does.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Applause)
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd if you would like to know why I am not a father \u2014
p284
aVI, who by a miracle have 22 godchildren \u2014
p285
aVthe answer is in this poem,
p286
aVwhich upsets me every time I read it.
p287
aa(lp288
V"Love Came to Visit Me."
p289
aa(lp290
VLove came to visit me,
p291
aVshy as a fawn.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut finding me busy,
p294
aVshe fled, with the dawn.
p295
aa(lp296
VAt 20 the torch of resentment was lit.
p297
aa(lp298
VMy rage at injustice
p299
aVwaxed hot as the pits.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe flux of its lava cleared all in its path.
p302
aa(lp303
VComrades and enemies fled from its wrath.
p304
aa(lp305
VYet lovers grew wary, once novelty waned
p306
aa(lp307
VTo lie with a bloody man,
p308
aVhis terror unfeigned.
p309
aa(lp310
VAt 30 my powers seemed mighty to me.
p311
aa(lp312
VThe fruits of my rivals, I shook from the tree.
p313
aa(lp314
VBy guile and by bluster,
p315
aVby night and by day,
p316
aa(lp317
VI battered and scattered the fools from my way.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd women grew willing to sham and to bluff.
p320
aa(lp321
VTheir trinkets and baubles cost little enough.
p322
aa(lp323
VFrom 40 to 50, grown easy and sly,
p324
aa(lp325
VI wined them and dined them, like pigs in a sty.
p326
aa(lp327
VWe feasted and reveled and rutted in muck,
p328
aa(lp329
VForgetting our peril, forgetting to duck,
p330
aa(lp331
VForgetting times arrows are sharper than knives.
p332
aa(lp333
VGrown sick to our stomachs,
p334
aVand sick of our lives.
p335
aa(lp336
VLove came to visit me,
p337
aVshy as a fawn.
p338
aa(lp339
VBut finding me busy,
p340
aVshe fled with the dawn.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VUm, there are \u2014
p345
aVI've got far too much money and I have far too much fun
p346
aVin my businesses.
p347
aVSo poetry came as a complete shock to me, ladies and gentlemen.
p348
aVA complete shock. I was a little ill.
p349
aVOkay, I was ill.
p350
aVOkay, I had a life-threatening illness, you know.
p351
aVI was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls.
p352
aVI wasn't allowed to see any of my \u2014 you know, whatever.
p353
aVSo, in the end I begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse.
p354
aVAnd from another nurse, I begged a pencil, pen.
p355
aVAnd I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry.
p356
aVThat was in October of 2000.
p357
aa(lp358
VI'm not an evil man.
p359
aVBut sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position.
p360
aVI'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman,
p361
aVwho men fall down, you know, when she walks in a room.
p362
aVBut sometimes I try to put myself in that position.
p363
aV(Laughter)
p364
aVNot with much success.
p365
aVBut it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse.
p366
aVI love to think what they thought, what it was like.
p367
aa(lp368
VBecause although
p369
aVmany of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience,
p370
aValthough you guys can not only go to the moon,
p371
aVyou know, you're going to totally transform everything.
p372
aVCloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything.
p373
aVI don't know. You can do anything you want.
p374
aVAll you guys are so clever, and women, you can do it all!
p375
aa(lp376
VBut human nature doesn't change, mate.
p377
aVMy friends, human nature is exactly the same as it was
p378
aVwhen my ancestor \u2014
p379
aVprobably it was my ancestor \u2014
p380
aVgot his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal,
p381
aVand battered the bastard to death.
p382
aVYou think we didn't do that?
p383
aVOh, we did.
p384
aVWe killed every single one of them.
p385
aVInch by inch we killed them.
p386
aVWe hunted them down wherever they were.
p387
aVRivals for meat. Rivals for berries.
p388
aVWe're still doing it,
p389
aVwith all of the genius assembled in this room.
p390
aVOur natures haven't changed a single iota.
p391
aVAnd they never will.
p392
aVEven when we've got off this little planet,
p393
aVand have put some of our eggs in some other baskets.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd I am as bad as you.
p396
aVI spent eight years
p397
aVrunning one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world.
p398
aVAnd at seven o'clock every night,
p399
aVI took me some more girls, already corrupted.
p400
aVI never did anything to anyone that wasn't.
p401
aVAnd I took crack cocaine,
p402
aVevery single night for seven years.
p403
aVIt was like Dante's "Inferno."
p404
aVIt was unbelievable.
p405
aVOne of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection
p406
aVfor about four hours.
p407
aVAnd you stay up for 12.
p408
aVIt was absolutely unbelievable.
p409
aVTwenty-two godchildren I've got.
p410
aVWhat do I say to them?
p411
aVI only stopped because I thought if I got caught,
p412
aVwhat would happen to my mother.
p413
aVIf you're a woman, remember that.
p414
aVThe love of your son
p415
aVcan utterly transform anything he does.
p416
aa(lp417
V"Our Lady in White."
p418
aa(lp419
VPale she was, listless;
p420
aa(lp421
VAnd soft to the touch.
p422
aa(lp423
VA generous mistress Whom many loved much.
p424
aa(lp425
VShoulder to shoulder, Night after night,
p426
aa(lp427
VWe hoarded and sold her \u2014
p428
aa(lp429
VOur Lady in White.
p430
aa(lp431
VWe breathed but to savor
p432
aVher crystal caress.
p433
aa(lp434
VWe craved but to favor the hem of her dress.
p435
aa(lp436
VWe dabbled and babbled,
p437
aVDenying our thirsts.
p438
aa(lp439
VBut always we scrabbled
p440
aVto lie with her first.
p441
aa(lp442
VAbsent, we missed her,
p443
aVgrew haggard and limp.
p444
aa(lp445
VToyed with her sister,
p446
aVor threatened her pimp.
p447
aa(lp448
VCame word out of Babel, the lady returns!
p449
aa(lp450
VAnd there on the table we took her, in turns.
p451
aa(lp452
VSensing the power that tyranny craves,
p453
aa(lp454
VThere in that hour, she made us her slaves.
p455
aa(lp456
VMany there were, to covet her kiss.
p457
aa(lp458
VMy shame as a spur,
p459
aVI fled the abyss.
p460
aa(lp461
VBut only just.
p462
aa(lp463
V(Applause)

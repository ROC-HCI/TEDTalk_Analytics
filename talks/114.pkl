VI just want to say, over the last few years I've been \u2014
p5
aVhad the opportunity to do this closing conference.
p6
aVAnd I've had some incredible warm-up acts.
p7
aVAbout eight years ago,
p8
aVBilly Graham opened for me.
p9
aVAnd I thought that there was \u2014
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VI thought that there was absolutely no way
p14
aVin hell to top that.
p15
aVBut I just wanted to say \u2014
p16
aVand I mean this without irony \u2014
p17
aVI think I can speak for everybody in the audience
p18
aVwhen I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Applause)
p21
aa(lp22
VOK, this is the title of my talk today.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VI just want to give you a quick overview.
p27
aVFirst of all, please remember I'm completely politically correct,
p28
aVand I mean everything with great affection.
p29
aVIf any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy,
p30
aVnow is the time to check your Blackberry.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VJust to review, this is my TEDTalk.
p35
aVWe're going to do some jokes,
p36
aVsome gags,
p37
aVsome little skits \u2014
p38
aVand then we're going to talk about the L1 point.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VSo, one of the questions I ask myself
p43
aVis, was this the most distressing TED ever?
p44
aVLet's try and sum things up, shall we?
p45
aVImages of limb regeneration
p46
aVand faces filled with smallpox:
p47
aV21 percent of the conference.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VMentions of polar bears drowning: four percent.
p52
aVImages of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu: 64 percent.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd David Pogue singing show tunes.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Applause)
p59
aa(lp60
VBecause this is the most distressing TED ever,
p61
aVI've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next year's TED Bag.
p62
aVAnd if the \u2014 if the conference is anywhere near this distressing,
p63
aVthen we're going to have a scream bag next year.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VIt's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag, of course.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VSo you're going to be able to go like this.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VBring it over here
p76
aVand open it up. Aaaah!
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VMeanwhile, back at TED University,
p81
aVthis wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun Chips.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aVSo Robert Wright \u2014 I don't know,
p85
aa(lp86
VI felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to,
p87
aVit might have been him.
p88
aVI want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VHe was talking about morality.
p93
aVEconomy class morality is,
p94
aVwe want to bomb you back to the Stone Age.
p95
aVBusiness class morality is,
p96
aVdon't bomb Japan \u2014 they built my car.
p97
aVAnd first-class morality is, don't bomb Mexico \u2014 they clean my house.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VYes, it is politically incorrect.
p102
aVAll right,
p103
aVnow I want to do a little bit of a thing for you ...
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VAll right, now these are the wha \u2014
p108
aVI'd say, [mumble, mumble \u2014
p109
aVmumble, mumble, mumble, mumble,
p110
aVmumble] \u2014 ahh!
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VSo I wanted to show you guys \u2014
p115
aVI wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface
p116
aVthat lets you work with images just as easily
p117
aVas you \u2014 as a completely natural user interface.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd you can \u2014
p122
aVyou can use really natural hand gestures
p123
aVto like, go like this.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VNow we had a Harvard professor here \u2014
p128
aVshe was from Harvard, I just wanted to mention and \u2014
p129
aVand she was actually a professor from Harvard.
p130
aVAnd she was talking about seven-dimensional, inverted universes.
p131
aVWith, you know, of course, there's the gravity brain.
p132
aVThere's the weak brain. And then there's my weak brain,
p133
aVwhich is too \u2014 too \u2014 absolutely too weak to understand
p134
aVwhat the fuck she was talking about.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VNow \u2014
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
Vone of the things that is very important to me
p143
aVis to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for.
p144
aVAnd that's why I went out
p145
aVand I picked up a best-selling business book.
p146
aVYou know, it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology.
p147
aVAnd it's by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren,
p148
aVand it's called
p149
aV"The Porpoise Driven Life."
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd Rick is as
p154
aVa pagan god,
p155
aVwhich I thought was kind of appropriate,
p156
aVin a certain way.
p157
aVAnd now we're going to have kind of
p158
aVa little more visualization about Rick Warren.
p159
aVOK.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VAll right.
p164
aVNow, red is Rick Warren,
p165
aVand green is Daniel Dennett, OK?
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VThe scales here are religiosity from zero percent,
p170
aVor atheist, to 100 percent, Bible literally true.
p171
aVAnd then this is books sold \u2014 the logarithmic scale.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
V30,000, 300,000, three million, 30 million, 300 million.
p176
aVOK, now they're duking it out. Now they're duking it out.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd Rick Warren's kind of pulling ahead, kind of pulling ahead.
p181
aVYup, and his installed base is getting a little bigger.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VBut Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back.
p186
aVLet me turn the trails on, so you can see that a little bit better.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
V(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VNow, one of the things that's very important is,
p193
aVNicholas Negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per \u2014
p194
aVI'm sorry \u2014
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
Vabout One Laptop Per Child.
p199
aVNow let's talk about some of the characteristics
p200
aVthat are important for this revolutionary device.
p201
aVI'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters,
p202
aVand then I'll show it to you in person.
p203
aVFirst of all, it needs to be small.
p204
aVIt needs to be flat, so it's transportable.
p205
aVLightweight. Portable.
p206
aVUses very, very little power.
p207
aVVery, very high resolution.
p208
aVHas to be visible in bright daylight. Will work anywhere.
p209
aVAnd broadly applicable across many platforms.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow, we've actually done some research \u2014
p212
aVNeil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market.
p213
aVThey did some research; we came back; and we think we have the perfect prototype
p214
aVof what the students in the field are actually asking for.
p215
aVAnd here it is,
p216
aVthe $100 computer.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VOK, OK, OK, OK \u2014 excellent, excellent.
p221
aVNow, I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks.
p222
aVAnd he and his team of junior-high school students
p223
aVwere doing real science.
p224
aVSo we're trying to check and trying to douse here,
p225
aVand see who uses marijuana.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VSee who uses marijuana.
p230
aVAre we going to be able to find any marijuana, Jim Young?
p231
aVOnly if we open enough locker doors.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VOK, now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness.
p236
aVWe had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox.
p237
aVI wanted to show you the stages of smallpox.
p238
aVWe start. This is day one.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VDay two.
p243
aVDay three, she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder.
p244
aVDay three.
p245
aVDay four.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VDay five
p250
aVand day six.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VNow the good news is, because I'm a trained medical professional,
p255
aVI know that even though she'll be scarred for life,
p256
aVshe's going to make a full recovery.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VNow the good news about Architects for Humanity
p261
aVis they're really kind of the most amazing group.
p262
aVThey've been sponsoring a design competition
p263
aVto come up with innovative medical housing solutions,
p264
aVclinic solutions, in Africa,
p265
aVand they've had a design competition.
p266
aVNow the wonderful thing is, Larry Brilliant was just appointed
p267
aVthe head of the Google Foundation,
p268
aVand so he decided that he would support \u2014
p269
aVhe would support Cameron's work.
p270
aVAnd the way he decided to support that work
p271
aVwas by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers
p272
aVof Google snacks.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VSo I want to show you some prototypes.
p277
aVThe U.N. \u2014 you know, they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent,
p278
aVbut I think we have some more exciting things.
p279
aVThis is a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
V(Applause)
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd those roll-up cookies coated with white chocolate.
p286
aVAnd the really wonderful thing about this is,
p287
aVwhen you're done, well \u2014
p288
aVyou can eat it.
p289
aVBut the thing that I'm really, really excited about
p290
aVis this incredible granola house.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof
p295
aVto collect water and recycle it.
p296
aVAnd it's \u2014 well, on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids
p297
aVand Gummy Bears to let in the light.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VBut on this side, it has sugary Gummy Bears,
p302
aVto diffuse the light more slightly.
p303
aVAnd we \u2014 we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
V(Applause)
p308
aa(lp309
VSo, Einstein \u2014
p310
aVEinstein, tell me \u2014
p311
aVwhat's your favorite song?
p312
aVNo, I said what's your favorite song?
p313
aVNo, I said what's your favorite song?
p314
aV"Free Bird."
p315
aa(lp316
V(Laughter)
p317
aa(lp318
V(Applause)
p319
aa(lp320
VOK, so, Einstein,
p321
aVwhat's your favorite singing group?
p322
aVCould you say that again? What's your favorite singing group?
p323
aVOK, one more time \u2014 I'm just going to give you a little help.
p324
aVYour favorite singing group \u2014 it's Diana Ross and the \u2014
p325
aa(lp326
VAudience: Supremes!
p327
aa(lp328
VTom Reilly: Exactly.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VCould we have the sound up on the laptop, please?
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
V"Free Bird" kind of reminds me that if you \u2014
p337
aVif you listen to "Free Bird" backwards,
p338
aVthis is what you might hear.
p339
aa(lp340
VComputer: Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan.
p341
aVSatan. Satan. Satan.
p342
aVTR: Now it's a little hard to hear the whole message, so I wanted to \u2014
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
Vso I wanted to help you a little bit.
p347
aa(lp348
VComputer: My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan.
p349
aVBuy "The Purpose-Driven Life," or Satan will take your soul.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VTR: So,
p354
aVwe've talked a lot about global warming,
p355
aVbut, you know, as Jill said, it sounds kind of nice \u2014
p356
aVgood weather in the wintertime, and New York City.
p357
aVAnd as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough.
p358
aVSo Al, I actually think I'm rather good at branding.
p359
aVSo I've tried to figure out a good design process
p360
aVto come up with a new term to replace "global warming."
p361
aa(lp362
VSo we started with Babel Fish. We put in global warming.
p363
aVAnd then we decided that we'd change it from English to Dutch \u2014
p364
aVinto "Het globale Verwarmen."
p365
aVFrom Dutch to [Korean], into "Hordahordaneecheewa."
p366
aa(lp367
V(Laughter)
p368
aa(lp369
V[Korean] to Portuguese: Aquecer-se Global.
p370
aVThen Portuguese to Pig Latin.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VAquecer-se ucked-fay.
p375
aVAnd then finally back into the English,
p376
aVwhich is, we're totally fucked.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
V(Applause)
p381
aa(lp382
VNow I don't know about you,
p383
aVbut Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human beings \u2014
p384
aVevolutionarily, they're designed to see patterns in things.
p385
aVFor example, in cheese sandwiches.
p386
aVNow can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary?
p387
aVI tried to make it a little bit clearer.
p388
aa(lp389
V(Laughter)
p390
aa(lp391
VIs it the Virgin Mary?
p392
aVOr is it Mena Trott?
p393
aa(lp394
VSo, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center
p395
aVand the conferences. It's getting awfully big.
p396
aVIt's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit.
p397
aVSo we tried to come up with a program \u2014
p398
aVhow we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED.
p399
aVSo first of all we decided \u2014
p400
aa(lp401
V(Laughter)
p402
aa(lp403
Vthat we needed about one-third bookstore,
p404
aVone-third Google cafe,
p405
aVabout 20 percent registration, 80 percent luxury hotel,
p406
aVabout five percent for restrooms.
p407
aVAnd then of course, we wanted to have the simulcast lounge,
p408
aVthe lobby and the Steinbeck forum.
p409
aa(lp410
VNow let me show you how that
p411
aVliterally translated into the design program.
p412
aVSo first,
p413
aVone of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming
p414
aVand Greenland melts as you say, the ocean level
p415
aVis going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center.
p416
aVSo we're going to build this new building on stilts.
p417
aVSo we build this building on stilts,
p418
aVthen up here \u2014
p419
aa(lp420
V(Laughter)
p421
aa(lp422
Vis where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium.
p423
aa(lp424
V(Laughter)
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is,
p427
aVit's going to be shaped in a spiral that's organized by the Dewey Decimal System.
p428
aa(lp429
V(Laughter)
p430
aa(lp431
VThen we're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there.
p432
aVAnd finally, we're going to put the Marriott Hotel
p433
aVand the Portola Plaza on the top.
p434
aa(lp435
V(Applause)
p436
aa(lp437
VNow I don't know about you, but sometimes I have these images in my head
p438
aVof separated at birth.
p439
aVI don't know about you, but when I see Aubrey de Grey,
p440
aVI immediately go to Gandalf the Grey.
p441
aa(lp442
V(Laughter)
p443
aa(lp444
VOK. Now, we've heard, of course,
p445
aVthat we're all soldiers here.
p446
aVSo what I'd really, really like you to do now is,
p447
aVpick up your white piece of paper. Does everybody have their white piece of paper?
p448
aVAnd I want you to get out a pen,
p449
aVand I want you to write a terrorist note.
p450
aa(lp451
V(Laughter)
p452
aa(lp453
VIf we put up the ELMO for a moment \u2014
p454
aVif we put up the ELMO, then we'll get, you know,
p455
aVI'll give you a model that you can work from, OK?
p456
aa(lp457
V(Laughter)
p458
aa(lp459
VAnd then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane.
p460
aVAnd once you've folded it into a paper airplane,
p461
aVI want you to take some anthrax \u2014
p462
aa(lp463
V(Laughter)
p464
aa(lp465
Vand I want you to put that in the paper airplane.
p466
aVAnd then I want you to throw it on Jim Young.
p467
aa(lp468
V(Laughter)
p469
aa(lp470
VLuckily, I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year.
p471
aVAnd I wanted to see \u2014
p472
aVI want to dedicate this film to my father, Homer.
p473
aVOK.
p474
aa(lp475
VNow this film isn't really hard enough,
p476
aVso I wanted to make it a little bit harder.
p477
aVSo I'm going to try and do this while reciting pi.
p478
aa(lp479
V(Laughter)
p480
aa(lp481

p489
aa(lp490

p491
aa(lp492
VCan we cue the music please?
p493
aa(lp494
V(Applause)
p495
aa(lp496
VNow I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit.
p497
aVBack in 1968,
p498
aVyou can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain
p499
aVwas covered in 151 inches of snow pack.
p500
aVParenthetically, over there on the slopes,
p501
aVI did want to show you that black men ski.
p502
aa(lp503
V(Laughter)
p504
aa(lp505
VBut over the years,
p506
aV10 years later, the snow packs eroded,
p507
aVand, if you notice, the trees have started turning yellow.
p508
aVThe water level of the lake has started drying up.
p509
aVA few years later, there's no snow left at all.
p510
aVAnd all the trees have turned brown.
p511
aVThis year, unfortunately the lakebed's
p512
aVturned into an absolute cracked dry bed.
p513
aVAnd I fear, if we do nothing for our planet,
p514
aVin 20 years, it's going to look like this.
p515
aa(lp516
V(Laughter)
p517
aa(lp518
VMr. Vice President, I wish I knew how to quit you.
p519
aa(lp520
V(Laughter)
p521
aa(lp522
V(Applause)
p523
aa(lp524
VThank you very much.

VI'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now,
p5
aVthat we think is going to change the way that
p6
aVcomputer games and Hollywood movies are being made.
p7
aVThat technology is simulating humans.
p8
aVIt's simulated humans with a simulated body
p9
aVand a simulated nervous system to control that body.
p10
aVNow, before I talk more about that technology,
p11
aVlet's have a quick look at what human characters look like
p12
aVat the moment in computer games.
p13
aVThis is a clip from a game called "Grand Theft Auto 3."
p14
aVWe already saw that briefly yesterday.
p15
aVAnd what you can see is \u2014 it is actually a very good game.
p16
aVIt's one of the most successful games of all time.
p17
aVBut what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive.
p18
aVThey pretty much look the same.
p19
aVI've made him run into a wall here, over and over again.
p20
aVAnd you can see he looks always the same.
p21
aVThe reason for that is that these characters
p22
aVare actually not real characters.
p23
aVThey are a graphical visualization of a character.
p24
aa(lp25
VTo produce these animations, an animator at a studio has to anticipate
p26
aVwhat's going to happen in the actual game,
p27
aVand then has to animate that particular sequence.
p28
aVSo, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen,
p29
aVand then these particular animations are just played back
p30
aVat appropriate times in the computer game.
p31
aVNow, the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity.
p32
aVAll you have is animations that are played back
p33
aVat more or less the appropriate times.
p34
aVIt also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be,
p35
aVbecause you only get out of it, at least in terms of the character,
p36
aVwhat you actually put into it.
p37
aVThere's no real emergence there.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd thirdly, as I said, most of the animations are very repetitive because of that.
p40
aVNow, the only way to get around that
p41
aVis to actually simulate the human body
p42
aVand to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body.
p43
aVAnd maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstration
p44
aVto show what the difference is \u2014
p45
aVbecause, I mean, it's very, very trivial.
p46
aVIf I push Chris a bit, like this, for example, he'll react to it.
p47
aVIf I push him from a different angle, he'll react to it differently,
p48
aVand that's because he has a physical body,
p49
aVand because he has the motor skills to control that body.
p50
aVIt's a very trivial thing.
p51
aVIt's not something you get in computer games at the moment, at all.
p52
aVThank you very much. Chris Anderson: That's it?
p53
aa(lp54
VTorsten Reil: That's it, yes.
p55
aVSo, that's what we're trying to simulate \u2014
p56
aVnot Chris specifically, I should say, but humans in general.
p57
aVNow, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University,
p58
aVand we tried to start very simply.
p59
aVWhat we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.
p60
aVThat stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.
p61
aVSo, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.
p62
aVIf you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.
p63
aVThe tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it
p64
aVthat actually makes it work.
p65
aVAnd for that, we use the neural network, which we based on
p66
aVthat part of the nervous system that we have in our spine
p67
aVthat controls walking in humans.
p68
aVIt's called the central pattern generator.
p69
aVSo, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bit
p70
aVis to teach that network how to walk.
p71
aVFor that we used artificial evolution \u2014 genetic algorithms.
p72
aa(lp73
VWe heard about those already yesterday,
p74
aVand I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already.
p75
aVBut, just briefly, the concept is that
p76
aVyou create a large number of different individuals \u2014
p77
aVneural networks, in this case \u2014
p78
aVall of which are random at the beginning.
p79
aVYou hook these up \u2014 in this case, to the virtual muscles
p80
aVof that two-legged creature here \u2014
p81
aVand hope that it does something interesting.
p82
aVAt the beginning, they're all going to be very boring.
p83
aVMost of them won't move at all,
p84
aVbut some of them might make a tiny step.
p85
aVThose are then selected by the algorithm,
p86
aVreproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well.
p87
aVAnd you repeat that process over and over again,
p88
aVuntil you have something that walks \u2014
p89
aVin this case, in a straight line, like this.
p90
aVSo that was the idea behind this.
p91
aVWhen we started this, I set up the simulation one evening.
p92
aVIt took about three to four hours to run the simulation.
p93
aVI got up the next morning, went to the computer and looked at the results,
p94
aVand was hoping for something that walked in a straight line,
p95
aVlike I've just demonstrated,
p96
aVand this is what I got instead.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VSo, it was back to the drawing board for us.
p101
aVWe did get it to work eventually,
p102
aVafter tweaking a bit here and there.
p103
aVAnd this is an example of a successful evolutionary run.
p104
aVSo, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped
p105
aVthat's learning how to walk using artificial evolution.
p106
aVAt the beginning, it can't walk at all,
p107
aVbut it will get better and better over time.
p108
aVSo, this is the one that can't walk at all.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, after five generations of applying evolutionary process,
p113
aVthe genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VGeneration 10 and it'll take a few steps more \u2014
p118
aVstill not quite there.
p119
aVBut now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.
p120
aVThat was the real breakthrough for us.
p121
aVIt was, academically, quite a challenging project,
p122
aVand once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident
p123
aVthat we could try and do other things as well with this approach \u2014
p124
aVactually simulating the body
p125
aVand simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it.
p126
aVNow, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very exciting
p127
aVfor things like computer games or online worlds.
p128
aVWhat you see here is the character standing there,
p129
aVand there's an obstacle that we put in its way.
p130
aVAnd what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.
p131
aVNow, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right,
p132
aVwhich is what I'm doing now, here,
p133
aVit will fall over it in a completely different way.
p134
aVAnd again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, what you see, by the way, at the top there,
p139
aVare some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles.
p140
aVOkay. That's the video. Thanks.
p141
aVNow, this might look kind of trivial, but it's actually very important
p142
aVbecause this is not something you get at the moment
p143
aVin any interactive or any virtual worlds.
p144
aVNow, at this stage, we decided to start a company and move this further,
p145
aVbecause obviously this was just a very simple, blocky biped.
p146
aVWhat we really wanted was a full human body.
p147
aVSo we started the company.
p148
aVWe hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists
p149
aVto work on this, and the first thing we had to work on
p150
aVwas to create the human body, basically.
p151
aVIt's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine,
p152
aVbut it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing,
p155
aVand tried to make it as realistic as possible.
p156
aVWhat you see here on the screen right now
p157
aVis a very simple visualization of that body.
p158
aVI should add that it's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc.,
p159
aVbut what we've done here is use a very simple visualization,
p160
aVso you can concentrate on the movement.
p161
aVNow, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment,
p162
aVis just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens.
p163
aVNothing really interesting, basically.
p164
aVIt falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically.
p165
aVThe reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it.
p166
aVIt becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it.
p167
aVSo, this character now has motor skills in the upper body \u2014
p168
aVnothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.
p169
aVBut what it will do \u2014 I'm going to push it again.
p170
aVIt will realize autonomously that it's being pushed.
p171
aVIt's going to stick out its hands.
p172
aVIt's going to turn around into the fall, and try and catch the fall.
p173
aVSo that's what you see here.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, it gets really interesting
p176
aVif you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well.
p177
aVSo here, we've got the same character.
p178
aVI'm going to push it a bit harder now,
p179
aVharder than I just pushed Chris.
p180
aVBut what you'll see is \u2014 it's going to receive a push now from the left.
p181
aVWhat you see is it takes steps backwards,
p182
aVit tries to counter-balance,
p183
aVit tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land.
p184
aVI'll show you this again.
p185
aVAnd then, finally hits the floor.
p186
aVNow, this becomes really exciting
p187
aVwhen you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done.
p188
aVThat's something that you cannot do right now.
p189
aVAt the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games.
p190
aVWhat this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you,
p193
aVbut now I'm just going to push it from different directions.
p194
aVFirst, starting with a push from the right.
p195
aVThis is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on.
p196
aVNow, the angle will have changed a tiny bit,
p197
aVso you can see that the reaction is different.
p198
aVAgain, a push, now this time from the front.
p199
aVAnd you see it falls differently.
p200
aVAnd now from the left \u2014
p201
aVand it falls differently.
p202
aVThat was really exciting for us to see that.
p203
aVThat was the first time we've seen that.
p204
aVThis is the first time the public sees this as well,
p205
aVbecause we have been in stealth mode.
p206
aVI haven't shown this to anybody yet.
p207
aVNow, just a fun thing:
p208
aVwhat happens if you put that character \u2014
p209
aVthis is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it \u2014
p210
aVbut if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice.
p211
aVWe just did that for a laugh, just to see what happens.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd this is what happens.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VIt's nothing we had to do about this.
p222
aVWe just took this character that I just talked about,
p223
aVput it on a slippery surface, and this is what you get out of it.
p224
aVAnd that's a really fascinating thing about this approach.
p225
aVNow, when we went to film studios and games developers
p226
aVand showed them that technology, we got a very good response.
p227
aVAnd what they said was, the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen.
p228
aVBecause stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive,
p229
aVand there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously,
p230
aVbecause you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt.
p231
aVSo, they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman
p232
aVand that's what we've been working on for the past few months.
p233
aVAnd that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks.
p234
aVSo, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked.
p235
aVThat's what people want. That's what we're giving them.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VYou can see, it's always reacting.
p240
aVThis is not a dead body. This is a body who basically, in this particular case,
p241
aVfeels the force and tries to protect its head.
p242
aVOnly, I think it's quite a big blow again.
p243
aVYou feel kind of sorry for that thing,
p244
aVand we've seen it so many times now that
p245
aVwe don't really care any more.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VThere are much worse videos than this, by the way, which I have taken out, but ...
p250
aVNow, here's another one.
p251
aVWhat people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion,
p252
aVa strong force applied to the character,
p253
aVand have the character react to it in midair.
p254
aVSo that you don't have a character that looks limp,
p255
aVbut actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away,
p256
aVthat looks kind of alive in midair as well.
p257
aVSo this character is going to be hit by a force,
p258
aVit's going to realize it's in the air,
p259
aVand it's going to try and, well,
p260
aVstick out its arm in the direction where it's landing.
p261
aVThat's one angle; here's another angle.
p262
aVWe now think that the realism we're achieving with this
p263
aVis good enough to be used in films.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization.
p266
aVThis is something I just got last night
p267
aVfrom an animation studio in London, who are using our software
p268
aVand experimenting with it right now.
p269
aVSo this is exactly the same behavior that you saw,
p270
aVbut in a slightly better rendered version.
p271
aVSo if you look at the character carefully,
p272
aVyou see there are lots of body movements going on,
p273
aVnone of which you have to animate like in the old days.
p274
aVAnimators had to actually animate them.
p275
aVThis is all happening automatically in the simulation.
p276
aVThis is a slightly different angle,
p277
aVand again a slow motion version of this.
p278
aVThis is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time.
p279
aVYou can run this simulation in real time, in front of your eyes,
p280
aVchange it, if you want to, and you get the animation straight out of it.
p281
aVAt the moment, doing something like this by hand
p282
aVwould take you probably a couple of days.
p283
aa(lp284
VThis is another behavior they requested.
p285
aVI'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway.
p286
aVIt's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach.
p287
aVIn this case, the character's hands
p288
aVare fixed to a particular point in space,
p289
aVand all we've told the character to do is to struggle.
p290
aVAnd it looks organic. It looks realistic.
p291
aVYou feel kind of sorry for the guy.
p292
aVIt's even worse \u2014 and that is another video I just got last night \u2014
p293
aVif you render that a bit more realistically.
p294
aa(lp295
VNow, I'm showing this to you just to show you
p296
aVhow organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look.
p297
aVAnd this is all a physical simulation of the body,
p298
aVusing AI to drive virtual muscles in that body.
p299
aVNow, one thing which we did for a laugh was
p300
aVto create a slightly more complex stunt scene,
p301
aVand one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond
p302
aVjumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee.
p303
aVGot a very short clip here.
p304
aa(lp305
VYes, you can just about see it here.
p306
aVIn this case, they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt.
p307
aVIt was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts.
p308
aVNow, we've just tried and \u2014 looked at our character and asked ourselves,
p309
aV"Can we do that ourselves as well?"
p310
aVCan we use the physical simulation of the character,
p311
aVuse artificial intelligence,
p312
aVput that artificial intelligence into the character,
p313
aVdrive virtual muscles, simulate the way he jumps off the dam,
p314
aVand then skydive afterwards,
p315
aVand have him caught by a bungee afterwards?
p316
aVWe did that. It took about altogether just two hours,
p317
aVpretty much, to create the simulation.
p318
aVAnd that's what it looks like, here.
p319
aVNow, this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages,
p320
aVand we pretty much just did this for a laugh,
p321
aVjust to see what we'd get out of it.
p322
aVBut what we found over the past few months
p323
aVis that this approach \u2014 that we're pretty much standard upon \u2014
p324
aVis incredibly powerful.
p325
aVWe are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations.
p326
aVThere's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before.
p327
aa(lp328
VThere's so many things we can do with this right now.
p329
aVThe first thing, as I said, is going to be virtual stuntmen.
p330
aVSeveral studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen,
p331
aVand they're going to hit the screen quite soon, actually,
p332
aVfor some major productions.
p333
aVThe second thing is video games.
p334
aVWith this technology, video games will look different and they will feel very different.
p335
aVFor the first time, you'll have actors that really feel very interactive,
p336
aVthat have real bodies that really react.
p337
aVI think that's going to be incredibly exciting.
p338
aVProbably starting with sports games,
p339
aVwhich are going to become much more interactive.
p340
aVBut I particularly am really excited
p341
aVabout using this technology in online worlds,
p342
aVlike there, for example, that Tom Melcher has shown us.
p343
aVThe degree of interactivity you're going to get
p344
aVis totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now.
p345
aa(lp346
VA third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation.
p347
aVWe've been approached by several simulation companies,
p348
aVbut one project we're particularly excited about, which we're starting next month,
p349
aVis to use our technology \u2014 and in particular, the walking technology \u2014
p350
aVto help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy,
p351
aVto predict the outcome of operations on these children.
p352
aVAs you probably know,
p353
aVit's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is
p354
aVif you try and correct the gait.
p355
aa(lp356
VThe classic quote is, I think, it's unpredictable at best,
p357
aVis what people think right now, is the outcome.
p358
aVNow, what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool.
p359
aVWe're going to simulate the gait of a particular child
p360
aVand the surgeon can then work on that simulation
p361
aVand try out different ways to improve that gait,
p362
aVbefore he actually commits to an actual surgery.
p363
aVThat's one project we're particularly excited about,
p364
aVand that's going to start next month.
p365
aVJust finally, this is only just the beginning.
p366
aVWe can only do several behaviors right now.
p367
aVThe AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body.
p368
aVThe body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have.
p369
aVAnd, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing.
p370
aVRight now, we don't have that
p371
aVbut I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage.
p372
aa(lp373
VWe do have one unintentional dancer actually,
p374
aVthe last thing I'm going to show you.
p375
aVThis was an AI contour that was produced and evolved \u2014
p376
aVhalf-evolved, I should say \u2014 to produce balance, basically.
p377
aVSo, you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance.
p378
aVThat's what we thought was going to come out of this.
p379
aVBut this is what emerged out of it, in the end.
p380
aa(lp381
V(Music)
p382
aa(lp383
VBizarrely, this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why.
p384
aVSo, this was not something we actually put in there.
p385
aVHe just started to create that dance himself.
p386
aVHe's actually a better dancer than I am, I have to say.
p387
aVAnd what you see after a while \u2014
p388
aVI think he even goes into a climax right at the end.
p389
aVAnd I think \u2014 there you go.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Laughter)
p392
aa(lp393
VSo, that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there.
p394
aVThat's just the simulation creating this itself, basically.
p395
aVSo it's just \u2014
p396
aa(lp397
V(Applause)
p398
aa(lp399
VThanks.
p400
aVNot quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well,
p401
aVso thanks very much for your time.
p402
aVThanks.
p403
aa(lp404
V(Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VCA: Incredible. That was really incredible.
p407
aa(lp408

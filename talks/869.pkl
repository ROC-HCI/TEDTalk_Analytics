VDo you worry about what is going to kill you?
p5
aVHeart disease, cancer,
p6
aVa car accident?
p7
aVMost of us worry about things we can't control,
p8
aVlike war, terrorism,
p9
aVthe tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti.
p10
aVBut what really threatens humanity?
p11
aVA few years ago, Professor Vaclav Smil
p12
aVtried to calculate the probability
p13
aVof sudden disasters
p14
aVlarge enough to change history.
p15
aVHe called these,
p16
aV"massively fatal discontinuities,"
p17
aVmeaning that they could kill
p18
aVup to 100 million people
p19
aVin the next 50 years.
p20
aVHe looked at the odds of another world war,
p21
aVof a massive volcanic eruption,
p22
aVeven of an asteroid hitting the Earth.
p23
aVBut he placed the likelihood of one such event
p24
aVabove all others
p25
aVat close to 100 percent,
p26
aVand that is a severe flu pandemic.
p27
aVNow, you might think of flu
p28
aVas just a really bad cold,
p29
aVbut it can be a death sentence.
p30
aVEvery year, 36,000 people in the United States
p31
aVdie of seasonal flu.
p32
aVIn the developing world, the data is much sketchier
p33
aVbut the death toll is almost
p34
aVcertainly higher.
p35
aVYou know, the problem is if
p36
aVthis virus occasionally mutates
p37
aVso dramatically,
p38
aVit essentially is a new virus
p39
aVand then we get a pandemic.
p40
aa(lp41
VIn 1918, a new virus appeared
p42
aVthat killed some 50 to 100 million people.
p43
aVIt spread like wildfire
p44
aVand some died within hours of developing symptoms.
p45
aVAre we safer today?
p46
aVWell, we seem to have dodged
p47
aVthe deadly pandemic this year
p48
aVthat most of us feared,
p49
aVbut this threat could reappear at any time.
p50
aVThe good news is that
p51
aVwe're at a moment in time
p52
aVwhen science, technology, globalization is converging
p53
aVto create an unprecedented possibility:
p54
aVthe possibility to make history
p55
aVby preventing infectious diseases
p56
aVthat still account for one-fifth of all deaths
p57
aVand countless misery on Earth.
p58
aVWe can do this.
p59
aVWe're already preventing millions of deaths
p60
aVwith existing vaccines,
p61
aVand if we get these to more people,
p62
aVwe can certainly save more lives.
p63
aVBut with new or better vaccines
p64
aVfor malaria, TB, HIV,
p65
aVpneumonia, diarrhea, flu,
p66
aVwe could end suffering
p67
aVthat has been on the Earth since the beginning of time.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo, I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you.
p70
aVBut first, I have to explain why they're important
p71
aVbecause vaccines, the power of them,
p72
aVis really like a whisper.
p73
aVWhen they work, they can make history,
p74
aVbut after a while
p75
aVyou can barely hear them.
p76
aVNow, some of us are old enough
p77
aVto have a small, circular scar on our arms
p78
aVfrom an inoculation we received as children.
p79
aVBut when was the last time you worried about smallpox,
p80
aVa disease that killed half a billion people last century
p81
aVand no longer is with us?
p82
aVOr polio? How many of you remember the iron lung?
p83
aVWe don't see scenes like this anymore
p84
aVbecause of vaccines.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, it's interesting
p87
aVbecause there are 30-odd diseases
p88
aVthat can be treated with vaccines now,
p89
aVbut we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu.
p90
aVWhy is that?
p91
aVWell, here's the dirty little secret.
p92
aVUntil recently, we haven't had to know
p93
aVexactly how a vaccine worked.
p94
aVWe knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.
p95
aVYou took a pathogen, you modified it,
p96
aVyou injected it into a person or an animal
p97
aVand you saw what happened.
p98
aVThis worked well for most pathogens,
p99
aVsomewhat well for crafty bugs like flu,
p100
aVbut not at all for HIV,
p101
aVfor which humans have no natural immunity.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo let's explore how vaccines work.
p104
aVThey basically create a cache
p105
aVof weapons for your immune system
p106
aVwhich you can deploy when needed.
p107
aVNow, when you get a viral infection,
p108
aVwhat normally happens is it takes days or weeks
p109
aVfor your body to fight back
p110
aVat full strength,
p111
aVand that might be too late.
p112
aVWhen you're pre-immunized,
p113
aVwhat happens is you have forces in your body
p114
aVpre-trained to recognize
p115
aVand defeat specific foes.
p116
aVSo that's really how vaccines work.
p117
aVNow, let's take a look at a video
p118
aVthat we're debuting at TED, for the first time,
p119
aVon how an effective HIV vaccine might work.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Music)
p122
aa(lp123
VNarrator: A vaccine trains the body in advance
p124
aVhow to recognize and neutralize
p125
aVa specific invader.
p126
aVAfter HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers,
p127
aVit infects immune cells to replicate.
p128
aVThe invader draws the attention
p129
aVof the immune system's front-line troops.
p130
aVDendritic cells, or macrophages,
p131
aVcapture the virus and display pieces of it.
p132
aVMemory cells generated by the HIV vaccine
p133
aVare activated when they learn
p134
aVHIV is present from the front-line troops.
p135
aVThese memory cells immediately deploy
p136
aVthe exact weapons needed.
p137
aVMemory B cells turn into plasma cells,
p138
aVwhich produce wave after wave
p139
aVof the specific antibodies
p140
aVthat latch onto HIV
p141
aVto prevent it from infecting cells,
p142
aVwhile squadrons of killer T cells
p143
aVseek out and destroy cells
p144
aVthat are already HIV infected.
p145
aVThe virus is defeated.
p146
aVWithout a vaccine,
p147
aVthese responses would have taken more than a week.
p148
aVBy that time, the battle against HIV
p149
aVwould already have been lost.
p150
aa(lp151
VSeth Berkley: Really cool video, isn't it?
p152
aVThe antibodies you just saw in this video,
p153
aVin action, are the ones that make most vaccines work.
p154
aVSo the real question then is:
p155
aVHow do we ensure that your body makes
p156
aVthe exact ones that we need to protect
p157
aVagainst flu and HIV?
p158
aVThe principal challenge for both of these viruses
p159
aVis that they're always changing.
p160
aVSo let's take a look at the flu virus.
p161
aVIn this rendering of the flu virus,
p162
aVthese different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you.
p163
aVAnd also, what the antibodies use is a handle
p164
aVto essentially grab and neutralize the virus.
p165
aVWhen these mutate, they change their shape,
p166
aVand the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore.
p167
aVSo that's why every year
p168
aVyou can catch a slightly different strain of flu.
p169
aVIt's also why in the spring,
p170
aVwe have to make a best guess
p171
aVat which three strains are going to prevail the next year,
p172
aVput those into a single vaccine
p173
aVand rush those into production for the fall.
p174
aa(lp175
VEven worse,
p176
aVthe most common influenza \u2014 influenza A \u2014
p177
aValso infects animals
p178
aVthat live in close proximity to humans,
p179
aVand they can recombine
p180
aVin those particular animals.
p181
aVIn addition, wild aquatic birds
p182
aVcarry all known strains
p183
aVof influenza.
p184
aVSo, you've got this situation:
p185
aVIn 2003,
p186
aVwe had an H5N1 virus
p187
aVthat jumped from birds into humans
p188
aVin a few isolated cases
p189
aVwith an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent.
p190
aVNow luckily, that particular virus,
p191
aValthough very scary at the time,
p192
aVdid not transmit from person to person
p193
aVvery easily.
p194
aVThis year's H1N1 threat
p195
aVwas actually a human, avian, swine mixture
p196
aVthat arose in Mexico.
p197
aVIt was easily transmitted,
p198
aVbut, luckily, was pretty mild.
p199
aVAnd so, in a sense,
p200
aVour luck is holding out,
p201
aVbut you know, another wild bird could fly over at anytime.
p202
aa(lp203
VNow let's take a look at HIV.
p204
aVAs variable as flu is,
p205
aVHIV makes flu
p206
aVlook like the Rock of Gibraltar.
p207
aVThe virus that causes AIDS
p208
aVis the trickiest pathogen
p209
aVscientists have ever confronted.
p210
aVIt mutates furiously,
p211
aVit has decoys to evade the immune system,
p212
aVit attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it
p213
aVand it quickly hides itself
p214
aVin your genome.
p215
aVHere's a slide looking at
p216
aVthe genetic variation of flu
p217
aVand comparing that to HIV,
p218
aVa much wilder target.
p219
aVIn the video a moment ago,
p220
aVyou saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells.
p221
aVNow realize that in a recently infected person,
p222
aVthere are millions of these ships;
p223
aVeach one is just slightly different.
p224
aVFinding a weapon that recognizes
p225
aVand sinks all of them
p226
aVmakes the job that much harder.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, in the 27 years since HIV
p229
aVwas identified as the cause of AIDS,
p230
aVwe've developed more drugs to treat HIV
p231
aVthan all other viruses put together.
p232
aVThese drugs aren't cures,
p233
aVbut they represent a huge triumph of science
p234
aVbecause they take away the automatic death sentence
p235
aVfrom a diagnosis of HIV,
p236
aVat least for those who can access them.
p237
aVThe vaccine effort though is really quite different.
p238
aVLarge companies moved away from it
p239
aVbecause they thought the science was so difficult
p240
aVand vaccines were seen as poor business.
p241
aVMany thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine,
p242
aVbut today, evidence tells us otherwise.
p243
aa(lp244
VIn September,
p245
aVwe had surprising but exciting findings
p246
aVfrom a clinical trial that took place in Thailand.
p247
aVFor the first time, we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans \u2014
p248
aValbeit, quite modestly \u2014
p249
aVand that particular vaccine was made
p250
aValmost a decade ago.
p251
aVNewer concepts and early testing now
p252
aVshow even greater promise in the best of our animal models.
p253
aVBut in the past few months, researchers have also isolated
p254
aVseveral new broadly neutralizing antibodies
p255
aVfrom the blood of an HIV infected individual.
p256
aVNow, what does this mean?
p257
aVWe saw earlier that HIV
p258
aVis highly variable,
p259
aVthat a broad neutralizing antibody
p260
aVlatches on and disables
p261
aVmultiple variations of the virus.
p262
aVIf you take these and you put them
p263
aVin the best of our monkey models,
p264
aVthey provide full protection from infection.
p265
aVIn addition, these researchers found
p266
aVa new site on HIV
p267
aVwhere the antibodies can grab onto,
p268
aVand what's so special about this spot
p269
aVis that it changes very little
p270
aVas the virus mutates.
p271
aVIt's like, as many times
p272
aVas the virus changes its clothes,
p273
aVit's still wearing the same socks,
p274
aVand now our job is to make sure
p275
aVwe get the body to really hate those socks.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo what we've got is a situation.
p278
aVThe Thai results tell us
p279
aVwe can make an AIDS vaccine,
p280
aVand the antibody findings
p281
aVtell us how we might do that.
p282
aVThis strategy, working backwards
p283
aVfrom an antibody to create a vaccine candidate,
p284
aVhas never been done before in vaccine research.
p285
aVIt's called retro-vaccinology,
p286
aVand its implications extend
p287
aVway beyond that of just HIV.
p288
aVSo think of it this way.
p289
aVWe've got these new antibodies we've identified,
p290
aVand we know that they latch onto many, many variations of the virus.
p291
aVWe know that they have to latch onto a specific part,
p292
aVso if we can figure out the precise structure of that part,
p293
aVpresent that through a vaccine,
p294
aVwhat we hope is we can prompt
p295
aVyour immune system to make these matching antibodies.
p296
aVAnd that would create
p297
aVa universal HIV vaccine.
p298
aVNow, it sounds easier than it is
p299
aVbecause the structure actually looks more like
p300
aVthis blue antibody diagram
p301
aVattached to its yellow binding site,
p302
aVand as you can imagine, these three-dimensional structures
p303
aVare much harder to work on.
p304
aVAnd if you guys have ideas to help us solve this,
p305
aVwe'd love to hear about it.
p306
aa(lp307
VBut, you know, the research that has occurred from HIV now
p308
aVhas really helped with innovation with other diseases.
p309
aVSo for instance, a biotechnology company
p310
aVhas now found broadly neutralizing
p311
aVantibodies to influenza,
p312
aVas well as a new antibody target on the flu virus.
p313
aVThey're currently making a cocktail \u2014
p314
aVan antibody cocktail \u2014 that can be used to treat
p315
aVsevere, overwhelming cases of flu.
p316
aVIn the longer term, what they can do
p317
aVis use these tools of retro-vaccinology
p318
aVto make a preventive flu vaccine.
p319
aVNow, retro-vaccinology is just one technique
p320
aVwithin the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design.
p321
aa(lp322
VLet me give you another example.
p323
aVWe talked about before the H and N spikes
p324
aVon the surface of the flu virus.
p325
aVNotice these other, smaller protuberances.
p326
aVThese are largely hidden from the immune system.
p327
aVNow it turns out that these spots
p328
aValso don't change much when the virus mutates.
p329
aVIf you can cripple these with specific antibodies,
p330
aVyou could cripple all versions of the flu.
p331
aVSo far, animal tests indicate
p332
aVthat such a vaccine could prevent severe disease,
p333
aValthough you might get a mild case.
p334
aVSo if this works in humans, what we're talking about
p335
aVis a universal flu vaccine,
p336
aVone that doesn't need to change every year
p337
aVand would remove the threat of death.
p338
aVWe really could think of flu, then,
p339
aVas just a bad cold.
p340
aa(lp341
VOf course, the best vaccine imaginable
p342
aVis only valuable to the extent
p343
aVwe get it to everyone who needs it.
p344
aVSo to do that, we have to combine
p345
aVsmart vaccine design with smart production methods
p346
aVand, of course, smart delivery methods.
p347
aVSo I want you to think back a few months ago.
p348
aVIn June, the World Health Organization
p349
aVdeclared the first global
p350
aVflu pandemic in 41 years.
p351
aVThe U.S. government promised
p352
aV150 million doses of vaccine
p353
aVby October 15th for the flu peak.
p354
aVVaccines were promised to developing countries.
p355
aVHundreds of millions of dollars were spent
p356
aVand flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing.
p357
aVSo what happened?
p358
aa(lp359
VWell, we first figured out
p360
aVhow to make flu vaccines, how to produce them,
p361
aVin the early 1940s.
p362
aVIt was a slow, cumbersome process
p363
aVthat depended on chicken eggs,
p364
aVmillions of living chicken eggs.
p365
aVViruses only grow in living things,
p366
aVand so it turned out that, for flu,
p367
aVchicken eggs worked really well.
p368
aVFor most strains, you could get one to two doses
p369
aVof vaccine per egg.
p370
aVLuckily for us,
p371
aVwe live in an era of breathtaking
p372
aVbiomedical advances.
p373
aVSo today, we get our flu vaccines from ...
p374
aVchicken eggs,
p375
aV(Laughter)
p376
aVhundreds of millions of chicken eggs.
p377
aVAlmost nothing has changed.
p378
aVThe system is reliable
p379
aVbut the problem is you never know how well
p380
aVa strain is going to grow.
p381
aVThis year's swine flu strain
p382
aVgrew very poorly in early production:
p383
aVbasically .6 doses per egg.
p384
aVSo, here's an alarming thought.
p385
aVWhat if that wild bird flies by again?
p386
aVYou could see an avian strain
p387
aVthat would infect the poultry flocks,
p388
aVand then we would have no eggs for our vaccines.
p389
aVSo, Dan [Barber], if you want
p390
aVbillions of chicken pellets
p391
aVfor your fish farm,
p392
aVI know where to get them.
p393
aVSo right now, the world can produce
p394
aVabout 350 million doses
p395
aVof flu vaccine for the three strains,
p396
aVand we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses
p397
aVif we want to target a single variant
p398
aVlike swine flu.
p399
aVBut this assumes that our factories are humming
p400
aVbecause, in 2004,
p401
aVthe U.S. supply was cut in half
p402
aVby contamination at one single plant.
p403
aVAnd the process still takes
p404
aVmore than half a year.
p405
aa(lp406
VSo are we better prepared
p407
aVthan we were in 1918?
p408
aVWell, with the new technologies emerging now,
p409
aVI hope we can say definitively, "Yes."
p410
aVImagine we could produce enough flu vaccine
p411
aVfor everyone in the entire world
p412
aVfor less than half of what we're currently spending
p413
aVnow in the United States.
p414
aVWith a range of new technologies, we could.
p415
aVHere's an example:
p416
aVA company I'm engaged with has found
p417
aVa specific piece of the H spike of flu
p418
aVthat sparks the immune system.
p419
aVIf you lop this off and attach it
p420
aVto the tail of a different bacterium,
p421
aVwhich creates a vigorous immune response,
p422
aVthey've created a very powerful flu fighter.
p423
aVThis vaccine is so small
p424
aVit can be grown in a common bacteria, E. coli.
p425
aVNow, as you know, bacteria reproduce quickly \u2014
p426
aVit's like making yogurt \u2014
p427
aVand so we could produce enough swine origin flu
p428
aVfor the entire world in a few factories, in a few weeks,
p429
aVwith no eggs,
p430
aVfor a fraction of the cost of current methods.
p431
aa(lp432
V(Applause)
p433
aa(lp434
VSo here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies.
p435
aVAnd, aside from the radically increased production
p436
aVand huge cost savings \u2014
p437
aVfor example, the E. coli method I just talked about \u2014
p438
aVlook at the time saved: this would be lives saved.
p439
aVThe developing world,
p440
aVmostly left out of the current response,
p441
aVsees the potential of these alternate technologies
p442
aVand they're leapfrogging the West.
p443
aVIndia, Mexico and others are already
p444
aVmaking experimental flu vaccines,
p445
aVand they may be the first place
p446
aVwe see these vaccines in use.
p447
aVBecause these technologies are so efficient
p448
aVand relatively cheap,
p449
aVbillions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines
p450
aVif we can figure out how to deliver them.
p451
aa(lp452
VNow think of where this leads us.
p453
aVNew infectious diseases
p454
aVappear or reappear
p455
aVevery few years.
p456
aVSome day, perhaps soon,
p457
aVwe'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us.
p458
aVWill we be quick enough to react
p459
aVbefore millions die?
p460
aVLuckily, this year's flu was relatively mild.
p461
aVI say, "luckily" in part
p462
aVbecause virtually no one in the developing world
p463
aVwas vaccinated.
p464
aVSo if we have the political and financial foresight
p465
aVto sustain our investments,
p466
aVwe will master these and new tools of vaccinology,
p467
aVand with these tools we can produce
p468
aVenough vaccine for everyone at low cost
p469
aVand ensure healthy productive lives.
p470
aVNo longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year.
p471
aVNo longer does AIDS
p472
aVneed to kill two million a year.
p473
aVNo longer do the poor and vulnerable
p474
aVneed to be threatened by infectious diseases,
p475
aVor indeed, anybody.
p476
aVInstead of having Vaclav Smil's
p477
aV"massively fatal discontinuity" of life,
p478
aVwe can ensure
p479
aVthe continuity of life.
p480
aVWhat the world needs now are these new vaccines,
p481
aVand we can make it happen.
p482
aa(lp483
VThank you very much.
p484
aa(lp485
V(Applause)
p486
aa(lp487
VChris Anderson: Thank you.
p488
aV(Applause)
p489
aVThank you.
p490
aVSo, the science is changing.
p491
aVIn your mind, Seth \u2014 I mean, you must dream about this \u2014
p492
aVwhat is the kind of time scale
p493
aVon, let's start with HIV,
p494
aVfor a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable?
p495
aa(lp496
VSB: The game change can come at any time,
p497
aVbecause the problem we have now is
p498
aVwe've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans;
p499
aVwe just need a better one.
p500
aVAnd with these types of antibodies, we know humans can make them.
p501
aVSo, if we can figure out how to do that,
p502
aVthen we have the vaccine,
p503
aVand what's interesting is there already is
p504
aVsome evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem.
p505
aVSo, the challenge is full speed ahead.
p506
aa(lp507
VCA: In your gut, do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years?
p508
aa(lp509
VSB: You know, everybody says it's 10 years,
p510
aVbut it's been 10 years every 10 years.
p511
aVSo I hate to put a timeline
p512
aVon scientific innovation,
p513
aVbut the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends.
p514
aa(lp515
VCA: And that's the same with universal flu vaccine, the same kind of thing?
p516
aa(lp517
VSB: I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is
p518
aVwe've got a bunch \u2014 I just showed some of this \u2014
p519
aVa bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now.
p520
aVThey look good. The problem has been that,
p521
aVwhat we did is we invested in traditional technologies
p522
aVbecause that's what we were comfortable with.
p523
aVYou also can use adjuvants, which are chemicals you mix.
p524
aVThat's what Europe is doing, so we could have diluted out
p525
aVour supply of flu and made more available,
p526
aVbut, going back to what Michael Specter said,
p527
aVthe anti-vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen.
p528
aa(lp529
VCA: And malaria's even further behind?
p530
aa(lp531
VSB: No, malaria, there is a candidate
p532
aVthat actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial
p533
aVand is currently in phase three trials now.
p534
aVIt probably isn't the perfect vaccine, but it's moving along.
p535
aa(lp536
VCA: Seth, most of us do work where every month,
p537
aVwe produce something;
p538
aVwe get that kind of gratification.
p539
aVYou've been slaving away at this for more than a decade,
p540
aVand I salute you and your colleagues for what you do.
p541
aVThe world needs people like you. Thank you.
p542
aa(lp543
VSB: Thank you.

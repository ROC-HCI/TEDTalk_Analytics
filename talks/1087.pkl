VWell, this is about state budgets.
p5
aVThis is probably the most boring topic
p6
aVof the whole morning.
p7
aVBut I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic
p8
aVthat we need to care about.
p9
aVState budgets
p10
aVare big, big money \u2014
p11
aVI'll show you the numbers \u2014
p12
aVand they get very little scrutiny.
p13
aVThe understanding is very low.
p14
aVMany of the people involved
p15
aVhave special interests or short-term interests
p16
aVthat get them not thinking
p17
aVabout what the implications of the trends are.
p18
aVAnd these budgets
p19
aVare the key for our future;
p20
aVthey're the key for our kids.
p21
aVMost education funding \u2014
p22
aVwhether it's K through 12,
p23
aVor the great universities or community colleges \u2014
p24
aVmost of the money for those things
p25
aVis coming out of these state budgets.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut we have a problem.
p28
aVHere's the overall picture.
p29
aVU.S. economy is big \u2014
p30
aV14.7 trillion.
p31
aVNow out of that pie,
p32
aVthe government spends 36 percent.
p33
aVSo this is combining the federal level,
p34
aVwhich is the largest,
p35
aVthe state level and the local level.
p36
aVAnd it's really in this combined way
p37
aVthat you get an overall sense of what's going on,
p38
aVbecause there's a lot of complex things
p39
aVlike Medicaid and research money
p40
aVthat flow across those boundaries.
p41
aVBut we're spending 36 percent.
p42
aVWell what are we taking in?
p43
aVSimple business question.
p44
aVAnswer is 26 percent.
p45
aVNow this leaves 10 percent deficit,
p46
aVsort of a mind-blowing number.
p47
aVAnd some of that, in fact, is due to the fact
p48
aVthat we've had an economic recession.
p49
aVReceipts go down,
p50
aVsome spending programs go up,
p51
aVbut most of it is not because of that.
p52
aVMost of it is because of ways
p53
aVthat the liabilities are building up
p54
aVand the trends,
p55
aVand that creates a huge challenge.
p56
aVIn fact, this is the forecast picture.
p57
aVThere are various things in here:
p58
aVI could say we might raise more revenue,
p59
aVor medical innovation will make the spending even higher.
p60
aVIt is an increasingly difficult picture,
p61
aVeven assuming the economy does quite well \u2014
p62
aVprobably better than it will do.
p63
aVThis is what you see
p64
aVat this overall level.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow how did we get here?
p67
aVHow could you have a problem like this?
p68
aVAfter all, at least on paper,
p69
aVthere's this notion that these state budgets are balanced.
p70
aVOnly one state says
p71
aVthey don't have to balance the budget.
p72
aVBut what this means actually
p73
aVis that there's a pretense.
p74
aVThere's no real, true balancing going on,
p75
aVand in a sense, the games they play to hide that
p76
aVactually obscure the topic so much
p77
aVthat people don't see things
p78
aVthat are actually pretty straight-forward challenges.
p79
aVWhen Jerry Brown was elected,
p80
aVthis was the challenge that was put to him.
p81
aVThat is, through various gimmicks and things,
p82
aVa so-called balanced budget
p83
aVhad led him to have 25 billion missing
p84
aVout of the 76 billion in proposed spending.
p85
aVNow he's put together some thoughts:
p86
aVAbout half of that he'll cut,
p87
aVanother half,
p88
aVperhaps in a very complex set of steps,
p89
aVtaxes will be approved.
p90
aVBut even so,
p91
aVas you go out into those future years,
p92
aVvarious pension costs, health costs go up enough,
p93
aVand the revenue does not go up enough.
p94
aVSo you get a big squeeze.
p95
aa(lp96
VWhat were those things that allowed us to hide this?
p97
aVWell, some really nice little tricks.
p98
aVAnd these were somewhat noticed.
p99
aVThe paper said, "It's not really balanced.
p100
aVIt's got holes.
p101
aVIt perpetuates deficit spending.
p102
aVIt's riddled with gimmicks."
p103
aVAnd really when you get down to it,
p104
aVthe guys at Enron never would have done this.
p105
aVThis is so blatant,
p106
aVso extreme.
p107
aVIs anyone paying attention
p108
aVto some of the things these guys do?
p109
aVThey borrow money.
p110
aVThey're not supposed to, but they figure out a way.
p111
aVThey make you pay more in withholding
p112
aVjust to help their cash flow out.
p113
aVThey sell off the assets.
p114
aVThey defer the payments.
p115
aVThey sell off the revenues from tobacco.
p116
aVAnd California's not unique.
p117
aVIn fact, there's about five states that are worse
p118
aVand only really four states
p119
aVthat don't face this big challenge.
p120
aVSo it's systemic across the entire country.
p121
aVIt really comes from the fact
p122
aVthat certain long-term obligations \u2014
p123
aVhealth care, where innovation makes it more expensive,
p124
aVearly retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you,
p125
aVand just generosity \u2014
p126
aVthat these mis-accounting things
p127
aVallow to develop over time,
p128
aVthat you've got a problem.
p129
aVThis is the retiree health care benefits.
p130
aVThree million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability \u2014
p131
aVmuch worse than the car companies.
p132
aVAnd everybody looked at that
p133
aVand knew that that was headed toward a huge problem.
p134
aVThe forecast for the medical piece alone
p135
aVis to go from 26 percent of the budget
p136
aVto 42 percent.
p137
aa(lp138
VWell what's going to give?
p139
aVWell in order to accommodate that,
p140
aVyou would have to cut education spending in half.
p141
aVIt really is this young versus the old
p142
aVto some degree.
p143
aVIf you don't change that revenue picture,
p144
aVif you don't solve what you're doing in health care,
p145
aVyou're going to be deinvesting in the young.
p146
aVThe great University of California university system,
p147
aVthe great things that have gone on,
p148
aVwon't happen.
p149
aVSo far it's meant layoffs,
p150
aVincreased class sizes.
p151
aVWithin the education community there's this discussion of,
p152
aV"Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off,
p153
aVor the less good teachers who get laid off?"
p154
aVAnd there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes,
p155
aVwhere do you do that? How much effect does that have?
p156
aVAnd unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think,
p157
aVwell maybe you think that's okay.
p158
aVIn fact, no, education spending should not be cut.
p159
aVThere's ways, if it's temporary,
p160
aVto minimize the impact,
p161
aVbut it's a problem.
p162
aVIt's also really a problem for where we need to go.
p163
aVTechnology has a role to play.
p164
aVWell we need money to experiment with that,
p165
aVto get those tools in there.
p166
aVThere's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness,
p167
aVmeasuring them, giving them feedback,
p168
aVtaking videos in the classroom.
p169
aVThat's something I think is very, very important.
p170
aVWell you have to allocate dollars
p171
aVfor that system
p172
aVand for that incentive pay.
p173
aVIn a situation where you have growth,
p174
aVyou put the new money into this.
p175
aVOr even if you're flat, you might shift money into it.
p176
aVBut with the type of cuts we're talking about,
p177
aVit will be far, far harder
p178
aVto get these incentives for excellence,
p179
aVor to move over
p180
aVto use technology in the new way.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo what's going on?
p183
aVWhere's the brain trust
p184
aVthat's in error here?
p185
aVWell there really is no brain trust.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVIt's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up.
p188
aVJust look at this spending.
p189
aVCalifornia will spend over 100 billion,
p190
aVMicrosoft, 38,
p191
aVGoogle, about 19.
p192
aVThe amount of IQ in good numeric analysis,
p193
aVboth inside Google and Microsoft
p194
aVand outside, with analysts and people of various opinions \u2014
p195
aVshould they have spent on that?
p196
aVNo, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? \u2014
p197
aVit really is quite phenomenal.
p198
aVEverybody has an opinion.
p199
aVThere's great feedback.
p200
aVAnd the numbers are used to make decisions.
p201
aVIf you go over the education spending and the health care spending \u2014
p202
aVparticularly these long-term trends \u2014
p203
aVyou don't have that type of involvement
p204
aVon a number that's more important
p205
aVin terms of equity, in terms of learning.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo what do we need to do?
p208
aVWe need better tools.
p209
aVWe can get some things out on the Internet.
p210
aVI'm going to use my website
p211
aVto put up some things that will give the basic picture.
p212
aVWe need lots more.
p213
aVThere's a few good books,
p214
aVone about school spending and where the money comes from \u2014
p215
aVhow that's changed over time, and the challenge.
p216
aVWe need better accounting.
p217
aVWe need to take the fact
p218
aVthat the current employees, the future liabilities they create,
p219
aVthat should come out of the current budget.
p220
aVWe need to understand why they've done the pension accounting
p221
aVthe way they have.
p222
aVIt should be more like private accounting.
p223
aVIt's the gold standard.
p224
aVAnd finally, we need to really reward politicians.
p225
aVWhenever they say there's these long-term problems,
p226
aVwe can't say, "Oh, you're the messenger with bad news?
p227
aVWe just shot you."
p228
aVIn fact, there are some like these:
p229
aVErskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others,
p230
aVwho have gone through and given proposals
p231
aVfor this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.
p232
aVBut in fact, their work was sort of pushed off.
p233
aVIn fact, the week afterwards,
p234
aVsome tax cuts were done
p235
aVthat made the situation even worse
p236
aVthan their assumptions.
p237
aVSo we need these pieces.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow I think this is a solvable problem.
p240
aVIt's a great country with lots of people.
p241
aVBut we have to draw those people in,
p242
aVbecause this is about education.
p243
aVAnd just look at what happened with the tuitions
p244
aVwith the University of California
p245
aVand project that out for another three, four, five years \u2014
p246
aVit's unaffordable.
p247
aVAnd that's the kind of thing \u2014
p248
aVthe investment in the young \u2014
p249
aVthat makes us great, allows us to contribute.
p250
aVIt allows us to do the art,
p251
aVthe biotechnology, the software
p252
aVand all those magic things.
p253
aVAnd so the bottom line is
p254
aVwe need to care about state budgets
p255
aVbecause they're critical for our kids and our future.
p256
aa(lp257
VThank you.

CEO of Microsoft. A geek icon, tech visionary and business trailblazer, Gates&#39; leadership -- fueled by his long-held dream that <strong>millions might realize their potential through great software</strong> -- made Microsoft a personal computing powerhouse and a trendsetter in the Internet dawn. Whether you&#39;re a suit, chef, quant, artist, media maven, nurse or gamer, you&#39;ve probably used a Microsoft product today.<br /><br />In summer of 2008, Gates left his day-to-day role with Microsoft to focus on philanthropy. Holding that <strong>all lives have equal value (no matter where they&#39;re being lived)</strong>, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has now donated staggering sums to HIV/AIDS programs, libraries, agriculture research and disaster relief -- and offered vital guidance and creative funding to programs in global health and education. Gates believes his tech-centric strategy for giving will prove the killer app of planet Earth&#39;s next big upgrade. </p><p>Read a collection of Bill and Melinda Gates&#39; <a href=\\"http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">annual letters</a>, where they take stock of the Gates Foundation and the world.

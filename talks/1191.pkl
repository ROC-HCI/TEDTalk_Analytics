VPat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times.
p5
aVAnd take us through those,
p6
aVand introduce us to another Yemen.
p7
aa(lp8
VNadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here.
p9
aVAnd I would like to share with you all
p10
aVsome of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.
p11
aVThis picture shows a revolution
p12
aVstarted by women,
p13
aVand it shows women and men
p14
aVleading a mixed protest.
p15
aVThe other picture
p16
aVis the popularity of the real need for change.
p17
aVSo many people are there.
p18
aVThe intensity of the upspring.
p19
aVThis picture shows that the revolution
p20
aVhas allowed opportunities for training,
p21
aVfor education.
p22
aVThese women are learning about first aid
p23
aVand their rights according to the constitution.
p24
aa(lp25
VI love this picture.
p26
aVI just wanted to show
p27
aVthat over 60 percent of the Yemeni population
p28
aVare 15 years and below.
p29
aVAnd they were excluded from decision-making,
p30
aVand now they are in the forefront of the news,
p31
aVraising the flag.
p32
aVEnglish \u2014
p33
aVyou will see, this is jeans
p34
aVand tights,
p35
aVand an English expression \u2014
p36
aVthe ability to share with the world
p37
aVwhat is going on in our own country.
p38
aVAnd expression also,
p39
aVit has brought talents.
p40
aVYemenis are using cartoons
p41
aVand art,
p42
aVpaintings, comics,
p43
aVto tell the world and each other
p44
aVabout what's going on.
p45
aa(lp46
VObviously, there's always the dark side of it.
p47
aVAnd this is just one of the less-gruesome pictures
p48
aVof the revolution
p49
aVand the cost that we have to pay.
p50
aVThe solidarity
p51
aVof millions of Yemenis across the country
p52
aVjust demanding the one thing.
p53
aVAnd finally, lots of people are saying
p54
aVthat Yemen's revolution
p55
aVis going to break the country.
p56
aVIs it going to be so many different countries?
p57
aVIs it going to be another Somalia?
p58
aVBut we want to tell the world that, no,
p59
aVunder the one flag, we'll still remain as Yemeni people.
p60
aa(lp61
VPM: Thank you for those images, Nadia.
p62
aVAnd they do, in many ways,
p63
aVtell a different story
p64
aVthan the story of Yemen,
p65
aVthe one that is often in the news.
p66
aVAnd yet, you yourself
p67
aVdefy all those characterizations.
p68
aVSo let's talk about the personal story for a moment.
p69
aVYour father is murdered.
p70
aVThe Yemen Times already has
p71
aVa strong reputation in Yemen
p72
aVas an independent English language newspaper.
p73
aVHow did you then
p74
aVmake the decision and assume the responsibilities
p75
aVof running a newspaper,
p76
aVespecially in such times of conflict?
p77
aa(lp78
VNA: Well, let me first warn you
p79
aVthat I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl.
p80
aVI've guessed you've already noticed this by now.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aVIn Yemen, most women are veiled
p83
aVand they are sitting behind doors
p84
aVand not very much part of the public life.
p85
aVBut there's so much potential.
p86
aVI wish I could show you my Yemen.
p87
aVI wish you could see
p88
aVYemen through my eyes.
p89
aVThen you would know
p90
aVthat there's so much to it.
p91
aVAnd I was privileged because I was born into a family,
p92
aVmy father would always encourage the boys and the girls.
p93
aVHe would say we are equal.
p94
aVAnd he was such an extraordinary man.
p95
aVAnd even my mother \u2014 I owe it to my family.
p96
aVA story:
p97
aVI studied in India.
p98
aVAnd in my third year, I started becoming confused
p99
aVbecause I was Yemeni,
p100
aVbut I was also mixing up
p101
aVwith a lot of my friends in college.
p102
aVAnd I went back home and I said,
p103
aV"Daddy, I don't know who I am.
p104
aVI'm not a Yemeni; I'm not an Indian."
p105
aVAnd he said, "You are the bridge."
p106
aVAnd that is something I will keep in my heart forever.
p107
aVSo since then I've been the bridge,
p108
aVand a lot of people have walked over me.
p109
aa(lp110
VPM: I don't think so. (Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VNA: But it just helps tell
p113
aVthat some people are change agents
p114
aVin the society.
p115
aVAnd when I became editor-in-chief
p116
aVafter my brother actually \u2014
p117
aVmy father passed away in 1999,
p118
aVand then my brother until 2005 \u2014
p119
aVand everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.
p120
aV"What's this young girl coming in and showing off
p121
aVbecause it's her family business," or something.
p122
aVIt was very hard at first.
p123
aVI didn't want to clash with people.
p124
aVBut with all due respect
p125
aVto all the men, and the older men especially,
p126
aVthey did not want me around.
p127
aVIt was very hard, you know,
p128
aVto impose my authority.
p129
aVBut a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd in the first year,
p134
aVI had to fire half of the men.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aV(Applause)
p137
aVBrought in more women.
p138
aVBrought in younger men.
p139
aVAnd we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today.
p140
aVThe other thing is that it's about professionalism.
p141
aVIt's about proving who you are and what you can do.
p142
aVAnd I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now,
p143
aVbut in 2006 alone,
p144
aVwe won three international awards.
p145
aVOne of them is the IPI
p146
aVFree Media Pioneer Award.
p147
aVSo that was the answer
p148
aVto all the Yemeni people.
p149
aVAnd I want to score a point here,
p150
aVbecause my husband is in the room over there.
p151
aVIf you could please stand up, [unclear].
p152
aVHe has been very supportive of me.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Applause)
p155
aa(lp156
VPM: And we should point out
p157
aVthat he works with you as well at the paper.
p158
aVBut in assuming this responsibility
p159
aVand going about it as you have,
p160
aVyou have become a bridge
p161
aVbetween an older and traditional society
p162
aVand the one that you are now creating at the paper.
p163
aVAnd so along with changing who worked there,
p164
aVyou must have come up against another positioning
p165
aVthat we always run into, in particular with women,
p166
aVand it has to do with outside image,
p167
aVdress, the veiled woman.
p168
aVSo how have you dealt with this
p169
aVon a personal level
p170
aVas well as the women who worked for you?
p171
aa(lp172
VNA: As you know,
p173
aVthe image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black
p174
aVand covered, veiled women.
p175
aVAnd this is true.
p176
aVAnd a lot of it is
p177
aVbecause women are not able, are not free,
p178
aVto show their face to their self.
p179
aVIt's a lot of traditional imposing
p180
aVcoming by authority figures
p181
aVsuch as the men, the grandparents and so on.
p182
aVAnd it's economic empowerment
p183
aVand the ability for a woman to say,
p184
aV"I am as much contributing to this family, or more,
p185
aVthan you are."
p186
aVAnd the more empowered the women become,
p187
aVthe more they are able to remove the veil, for example,
p188
aVor to drive their own car
p189
aVor to have a job or to be able to travel.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo the other face of Yemen
p192
aVis actually one
p193
aVthat lies behind the veil,
p194
aVand it's economic empowerment mostly
p195
aVthat allows the woman to just uncover it.
p196
aVAnd I have done this throughout my work.
p197
aVI've tried to encourage young girls.
p198
aVWe started with, you can take it off in the office.
p199
aVAnd then after that, you can take it off on assignments.
p200
aVBecause I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with \u2014
p201
aVhow can you talk to people if you have your face covered? \u2014
p202
aVand so on; it's just a movement.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd I am a role model in Yemen.
p205
aVA lot of people look up to me.
p206
aVA lot of young girls look up to me.
p207
aVAnd I need to prove to them that, yes, you can still be married,
p208
aVyou can still be a mother,
p209
aVand you can still be respected within the society,
p210
aVbut at the same time,
p211
aVthat doesn't mean you [should] just be one of the crowd.
p212
aVYou can be yourself and have your face.
p213
aa(lp214
VPM: But by putting yourself personally out there \u2014
p215
aVboth projecting a different image
p216
aVof Yemeni women,
p217
aVbut also what you have made possible
p218
aVfor the women who work at the paper \u2014
p219
aVhas this put you in personal danger?
p220
aa(lp221
VNA: Well the Yemen Times, across 20 years,
p222
aVhas been through so much.
p223
aVWe've suffered prosecution;
p224
aVthe paper was closed down more than three times.
p225
aVIt's an independent newspaper,
p226
aVbut tell that to the people in charge.
p227
aVThey think that if there's anything against them,
p228
aVthen we are being an opposition newspaper.
p229
aVAnd very, very difficult times.
p230
aVSome of my reporters were arrested.
p231
aVWe had some court cases.
p232
aVMy father was assassinated.
p233
aVToday, we are in a much better situation.
p234
aVWe've created the credibility.
p235
aVAnd in times of revolution or change like today,
p236
aVit is very important for independent media to have a voice.
p237
aVIt's very important
p238
aVfor you to go to YemenTimes.com,
p239
aVand it's very important
p240
aVto listen to our voice.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd this is probably something
p243
aVI'm going to share with you
p244
aVin Western media probably \u2014
p245
aVand how there's a lot of stereotypes \u2014
p246
aVthinking of Yemen in one single frame:
p247
aVthis is what Yemen is all about.
p248
aVAnd that's not fair.
p249
aVIt's not fair for me; it's not fair for my country.
p250
aVA lot of reporters come to Yemen
p251
aVand they want to write a story on Al-Qaeda or terrorism.
p252
aVAnd I just wanted to share with you:
p253
aVthere's one reporter that came.
p254
aVHe wanted to do a documentary
p255
aVon what his editors wanted.
p256
aVAnd he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me \u2014
p257
aVhip hop \u2014
p258
aVthat there are young Yemeni men
p259
aVwho express themselves
p260
aVthrough dancing and puchu puchu.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVThat thing. (PM: Rap. Break dancing.)
p263
aVYeah, break dancing.
p264
aVI'm not so old.
p265
aVI'm just not in touch.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
V(Applause)
p270
aa(lp271
VPM: Yes, you are.
p272
aVActually, that's a documentary
p273
aVthat's available online; the video's online.
p274
aa(lp275
VNA: ShaketheDust.org.
p276
aa(lp277
VPM: "Shake the Dust." (NA: "Shake the Dust.")
p278
aa(lp279
VPM: ShaketheDust.org.
p280
aVAnd it definitely does give a different image of Yemen.
p281
aVYou spoke about the responsibility of the press.
p282
aVAnd certainly, when we look
p283
aVat the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others
p284
aVand we've created fear
p285
aVand danger,
p286
aVoften from lack of knowledge,
p287
aVlack of real understanding,
p288
aVhow do you see
p289
aVthe way that the Western press in particular
p290
aVis covering this and all other stories out of the region,
p291
aVbut in particular, in your country?
p292
aa(lp293
VNA: Well there is a saying that says,
p294
aV"You fear what you don't know,
p295
aVand you hate what you fear."
p296
aVSo it's about the lack of research, basically.
p297
aVIt's almost, "Do your homework," \u2014
p298
aVsome involvement.
p299
aVAnd you cannot do parachute reporting \u2014
p300
aVjust jump into a country for two days
p301
aVand think that you've done your homework and a story.
p302
aVSo I wish
p303
aVthat the world would know my Yemen,
p304
aVmy country, my people.
p305
aVI am an example, and there are others like me.
p306
aVWe may not be that many,
p307
aVbut if we are promoted
p308
aVas a good, positive example,
p309
aVthere will be others \u2014 men and women \u2014
p310
aVwho can eventually bridge the gap \u2014
p311
aVagain, coming to the bridge \u2014
p312
aVbetween Yemen and the world
p313
aVand telling first
p314
aVabout recognition
p315
aVand then about communication
p316
aVand compassion.
p317
aa(lp318
VI think Yemen is going to be
p319
aVin a very bad situation
p320
aVin the next two or three years.
p321
aVIt's natural.
p322
aVBut after the two years, which is a price we are willing to pay,
p323
aVwe are going to stand up again on our feet,
p324
aVbut in the new Yemen
p325
aVwith a younger and more empowered people \u2014
p326
aVdemocratic.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
VPM: Nadia, I think you've just given us
p331
aVa very different view of Yemen.
p332
aVAnd certainly you yourself and what you do
p333
aVhave given us a view of the future
p334
aVthat we will embrace
p335
aVand be grateful for.
p336
aVAnd the very best of luck to you.

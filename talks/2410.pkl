VWe've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us.
p5
aVOur ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago,
p6
aVshaping them to not only fit the task at hand
p7
aVbut also their hand.
p8
aa(lp9
VHowever, over the years,
p10
aVtools have become more and more specialized.
p11
aVThese sculpting tools have evolved through their use,
p12
aVand each one has a different form which matches its function.
p13
aVAnd they leverage the dexterity of our hands
p14
aVin order to manipulate things with much more precision.
p15
aVBut as tools have become more and more complex,
p16
aVwe need more complex controls to control them.
p17
aVAnd so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces
p18
aVthat allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things,
p19
aVsuch as taking a photograph and changing the focus
p20
aVor the aperture.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools
p23
aVbecause computation is dynamic.
p24
aVSo it can do a million different things
p25
aVand run a million different applications.
p26
aVHowever, computers have the same static physical form
p27
aVfor all of these different applications
p28
aVand the same static interface elements as well.
p29
aVAnd I believe that this is fundamentally a problem,
p30
aVbecause it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands
p31
aVand capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies.
p32
aVAnd my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces
p33
aVthat can capture these rich abilities that we have
p34
aVand that can physically adapt to us
p35
aVand allow us to interact in new ways.
p36
aVAnd so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab
p37
aVand now at Stanford.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii,
p40
aVwe created inFORM,
p41
aVwhere the interface can actually come off the screen
p42
aVand you can physically manipulate it.
p43
aVOr you can visualize 3D information physically
p44
aVand touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways.
p45
aVOr you can interact through gestures and direct deformations
p46
aVto sculpt digital clay.
p47
aVOr interface elements can arise out of the surface
p48
aVand change on demand.
p49
aVAnd the idea is that for each individual application,
p50
aVthe physical form can be matched to the application.
p51
aVAnd I believe this represents a new way
p52
aVthat we can interact with information,
p53
aVby making it physical.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo the question is, how can we use this?
p56
aVTraditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models
p57
aVof cities and buildings to better understand them.
p58
aVSo with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM
p59
aVto allow urban planners to design and view entire cities.
p60
aVAnd now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical,
p61
aVand you can also interact directly.
p62
aVOr you can look at different views,
p63
aVsuch as population or traffic information,
p64
aVbut it's made physical.
p65
aa(lp66
VWe also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change
p67
aVthe ways that we remotely collaborate with people.
p68
aVSo when we're working together in person,
p69
aVI'm not only looking at your face
p70
aVbut I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects,
p71
aVand that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype.
p72
aVAnd so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen
p73
aVand manipulate things at a distance.
p74
aVSo we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands,
p75
aVallowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance.
p76
aVAnd you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well,
p77
aVso you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them.
p78
aVAnd that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information
p79
aVin a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools.
p80
aVAnd so you can also bring in existing objects,
p81
aVand those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other.
p82
aVOr you can have an object that's linked between two places,
p83
aVso as I move a ball on one side,
p84
aVthe ball moves on the other as well.
p85
aVAnd so we do this by capturing the remote user
p86
aVusing a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, you might be wondering how does this all work,
p89
aVand essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators
p90
aVthat are connected to these mechanical linkages
p91
aVthat allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above.
p92
aVSo it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN,
p93
aVbut it did take a long time for us to build it.
p94
aVAnd so we started with a single motor,
p95
aVa single linear actuator,
p96
aVand then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them.
p97
aVAnd then we had to make a lot of them.
p98
aVAnd so the problem with having 900 of something
p99
aVis that you have to do every step 900 times.
p100
aVAnd so that meant that we had a lot of work to do.
p101
aVSo we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab
p102
aVand brought undergrads in and convinced them to do "research" \u2014
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
Vand had late nights watching movies, eating pizza
p107
aVand screwing in thousands of screws.
p108
aVYou know \u2014 research.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VBut anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things
p113
aVthat inFORM allowed us to do.
p114
aVIncreasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go.
p115
aVBut mobile devices, just like computers,
p116
aVare used for so many different applications.
p117
aVSo you use them to talk on the phone,
p118
aVto surf the web, to play games, to take pictures
p119
aVor even a million different things.
p120
aVBut again, they have the same static physical form
p121
aVfor each of these applications.
p122
aVAnd so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions
p123
aVthat we developed for inFORM
p124
aVand bring them to mobile devices.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display,
p127
aVwhich is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators
p128
aVthat can change shape,
p129
aVso you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book.
p130
aVOr you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations
p131
aVthat are richer than the vibration.
p132
aVOr buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact
p133
aVwhere you want them to be.
p134
aVOr you can play games and have actual buttons.
p135
aVAnd so we were able to do this
p136
aVby embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device,
p137
aVand that allow you not only to touch them
p138
aVbut also back-drive them as well.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change.
p141
aVSo we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device
p142
aVwhere you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ...
p143
aVto a wristband on the go.
p144
aVAnd so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab,
p145
aVwe created this new high-resolution version
p146
aVthat uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband
p147
aVto a touch-input device
p148
aVto a phone.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd we're also interested in looking at ways
p153
aVthat users can actually deform the interfaces
p154
aVto shape them into the devices that they want to use.
p155
aVSo you can make something like a game controller,
p156
aVand then the system will understand what shape it's in
p157
aVand change to that mode.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo, where does this point?
p160
aVHow do we move forward from here?
p161
aVI think, really, where we are today
p162
aVis in this new age of the Internet of Things,
p163
aVwhere we have computers everywhere \u2014
p164
aVthey're in our pockets, they're in our walls,
p165
aVthey're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years.
p166
aVBut what if we stopped thinking about devices
p167
aVand think instead about environments?
p168
aVAnd so how can we have smart furniture
p169
aVor smart rooms or smart environments
p170
aVor cities that can adapt to us physically,
p171
aVand allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people
p172
aVand doing new types of tasks?
p173
aa(lp174
VSo for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM,
p175
aVwhich is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays,
p176
aVwhich can move physical objects on the surface; for example,
p177
aVreminding you to take your keys.
p178
aVBut it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting.
p179
aVSo if you want to work,
p180
aVthen it can change to sort of set up your work system.
p181
aVAnd so as you bring a device over,
p182
aVit creates all the affordances you need
p183
aVand brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo, in conclusion,
p186
aVI really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way
p187
aVof interacting with computers.
p188
aVWe need computers that can physically adapt to us
p189
aVand adapt to the ways that we want to use them
p190
aVand really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands,
p191
aVand our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical.
p192
aVBut looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices,
p193
aVto really think about new ways that we can bring people together,
p194
aVand bring our information into the world,
p195
aVand think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically.
p196
aVSo with that, I will leave you.
p197
aa(lp198
VThank you very much.

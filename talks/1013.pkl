VI woke up in the middle of the night
p5
aVwith the sound of heavy explosion.
p6
aVIt was deep at night.
p7
aVI do not remember what time it was.
p8
aVI just remember the sound
p9
aVwas so heavy
p10
aVand so very shocking.
p11
aVEverything in my room was shaking \u2014
p12
aVmy heart, my windows,
p13
aVmy bed, everything.
p14
aVI looked out the windows
p15
aVand I saw a full half-circle
p16
aVof explosion.
p17
aVI thought it was just like the movies,
p18
aVbut the movies had not conveyed them
p19
aVin the powerful image that I was seeing
p20
aVfull of bright red
p21
aVand orange and gray,
p22
aVand a full circle of explosion.
p23
aVAnd I kept on staring at it
p24
aVuntil it disappeared.
p25
aVI went back to my bed,
p26
aVand I prayed,
p27
aVand I secretly thanked God
p28
aVthat that missile
p29
aVdid not land on my family's home,
p30
aVthat it did not kill my family that night.
p31
aVThirty years have passed,
p32
aVand I still feel guilty about that prayer,
p33
aVfor the next day, I learned that that missile
p34
aVlanded on my brother's friend's home
p35
aVand killed him
p36
aVand his father,
p37
aVbut did not kill his mother or his sister.
p38
aVHis mother showed up the next week
p39
aVat my brother's classroom
p40
aVand begged seven-year-old kids
p41
aVto share with her any picture they may have
p42
aVof her son,
p43
aVfor she had lost everything.
p44
aa(lp45
VThis is not a story
p46
aVof a nameless survivor of war,
p47
aVand nameless refugees,
p48
aVwhose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers
p49
aVand our TV
p50
aVwith tattered clothes,
p51
aVdirty face, scared eyes.
p52
aVThis is not a story of a nameless someone
p53
aVwho lived in some war,
p54
aVwho we do not know their hopes, their dreams,
p55
aVtheir accomplishments, their families,
p56
aVtheir beliefs, their values.
p57
aVThis is my story.
p58
aVI was that girl.
p59
aVI am another image and vision
p60
aVof another survivor of war.
p61
aVI am that refugee,
p62
aVand I am that girl.
p63
aVYou see,
p64
aVI grew up in war-torn Iraq,
p65
aVand I believe that there are two sides of wars
p66
aVand we've only seen
p67
aVone side of it.
p68
aVWe only talk about
p69
aVone side of it.
p70
aVBut there's another side
p71
aVthat I have witnessed
p72
aVas someone who lived in it
p73
aVand someone who ended up working in it.
p74
aa(lp75
VI grew up with the colors of war \u2014
p76
aVthe red colors of fire and blood,
p77
aVthe brown tones of earth
p78
aVas it explodes
p79
aVin our faces
p80
aVand the piercing silver
p81
aVof an exploded missile,
p82
aVso bright
p83
aVthat nothing can protect your eyes from it.
p84
aVI grew up
p85
aVwith the sounds of war \u2014
p86
aVthe staccato sounds of gunfire,
p87
aVthe wrenching booms of explosions,
p88
aVominous drones of jets flying overhead
p89
aVand the wailing warning sounds
p90
aVof sirens.
p91
aVThese are the sounds you would expect,
p92
aVbut they are also the sounds
p93
aVof dissonant concerts of a flock of birds
p94
aVscreeching in the night,
p95
aVthe high-pitched honest cries
p96
aVof children
p97
aVand the thunderous,
p98
aVunbearable
p99
aVsilence.
p100
aV"War," a friend of mine said,
p101
aV"is not about sound at all.
p102
aVIt is actually about silence,
p103
aVthe silence of humanity."
p104
aa(lp105
VI have since left Iraq
p106
aVand founded a group called Women for Women International
p107
aVthat ends up working
p108
aVwith women survivors of wars.
p109
aVIn my travels and in my work,
p110
aVfrom Congo to Afghanistan,
p111
aVfrom Sudan to Rwanda,
p112
aVI have learned not only
p113
aVthat the colors and the sounds of war are the same,
p114
aVbut the fears of war are the same.
p115
aVYou know, there is a fear of dying,
p116
aVand do not believe any movie character
p117
aVwhere the hero is not afraid.
p118
aVIt is very scary
p119
aVto go through that feeling
p120
aVof "I am about to die"
p121
aVor "I could die in this explosion."
p122
aVBut there's also the fear
p123
aVof losing loved ones,
p124
aVand I think that's even worse.
p125
aVIt's too painful. You don't want to think about it.
p126
aVBut I think the worst kind of fear is the fear \u2014
p127
aVas Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me,
p128
aVwho survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo;
p129
aVshe said, "The fear
p130
aVof losing
p131
aVthe 'I' in me,
p132
aVthe fear of losing
p133
aVthe 'I' in me."
p134
aVThat's what my mother in Iraq
p135
aVused to tell me.
p136
aVIt's like dying from inside-out.
p137
aVA Palestinian woman once told me,
p138
aV"It is not about the fear of one death,"
p139
aVshe said, "sometimes I feel
p140
aVI die 10 times in one day,"
p141
aVas she was describing the marches of soldiers
p142
aVand the sounds of their bullets.
p143
aVShe said, "But it's not fair,
p144
aVbecause there is only one life,
p145
aVand there should only be one death."
p146
aa(lp147
VWe have been only seeing
p148
aVone side of war.
p149
aVWe have only been discussing and consumed
p150
aVwith high-level preoccupations
p151
aVover troop levels, drawdown timelines,
p152
aVsurges and sting operations,
p153
aVwhen we should be examining the details
p154
aVof where the social fabric
p155
aVhas been most torn,
p156
aVwhere the community has improvised
p157
aVand survived
p158
aVand shown acts of resilience
p159
aVand amazing courage
p160
aVjust to keep life going.
p161
aVWe have been so consumed
p162
aVwith seemingly objective discussions
p163
aVof politics, tactics,
p164
aVweapons, dollars
p165
aVand casualties.
p166
aVThis is the language
p167
aVof sterility.
p168
aa(lp169
VHow casually
p170
aVwe treat casualties
p171
aVin the context of this topic.
p172
aVThis is where we conceive of rape and casualties
p173
aVas inevitabilities.
p174
aVEighty percent of refugees around the world
p175
aVare women and children. Oh.
p176
aVNinety percent of modern war casualties
p177
aVare civilians.
p178
aVSeventy-five percent of them are women and children.
p179
aVHow interesting.
p180
aVOh, half a million women in Rwanda
p181
aVget raped in 100 days.
p182
aVOr, as we speak now,
p183
aVhundreds of thousands of Congolese women
p184
aVare getting raped and mutilated.
p185
aVHow interesting.
p186
aVThese just become numbers that we refer to.
p187
aVThe front of wars
p188
aVis increasingly non-human eyes
p189
aVpeering down on our perceived enemies
p190
aVfrom space,
p191
aVguiding missiles toward unseen targets,
p192
aVwhile the human conduct
p193
aVof the orchestra of media relations
p194
aVin the event that this particular drone attack
p195
aVhits a villager
p196
aVinstead of an extremist.
p197
aVIt is a chess game.
p198
aVYou learn to play an international relations school
p199
aVon your way out and up
p200
aVto national and international leadership.
p201
aVCheckmate.
p202
aa(lp203
VWe are missing
p204
aVa completely other side of wars.
p205
aVWe are missing my mother's story,
p206
aVwho made sure with every siren, with every raid,
p207
aVwith every cut off-of electricity,
p208
aVshe played puppet shows for my brothers and I,
p209
aVso we would not be scared
p210
aVof the sounds of explosions.
p211
aVWe are missing the story of Fareeda,
p212
aVa music teacher,
p213
aVa piano teacher, in Sarajevo,
p214
aVwho made sure
p215
aVthat she kept the music school open
p216
aVevery single day
p217
aVin the four years of besiege in Sarajevo
p218
aVand walked to that school,
p219
aVdespite the snipers shooting
p220
aVat that school and at her,
p221
aVand kept the piano, the violin, the cello
p222
aVplaying the whole duration of the war,
p223
aVwith students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.
p224
aVThat was her fight.
p225
aVThat was her resistance.
p226
aVWe are missing the story of Nehia,
p227
aVa Palestinian woman in Gaza
p228
aVwho, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war,
p229
aVshe left out of home,
p230
aVcollected all the flour
p231
aVand baked as much bread for every neighbor to have,
p232
aVin case there is no cease-fire the day after.
p233
aVWe are missing
p234
aVthe stories of Violet,
p235
aVwho, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre,
p236
aVshe kept on going on,
p237
aVburying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.
p238
aVWe are missing stories of women
p239
aVwho are literally keeping life going
p240
aVin the midst of wars.
p241
aVDo you know \u2014
p242
aVdo you know that people fall in love in war
p243
aVand go to school
p244
aVand go to factories and hospitals
p245
aVand get divorced and go dancing and go playing
p246
aVand live life going?
p247
aVAnd the ones who are keeping that life
p248
aVare women.
p249
aa(lp250
VThere are two sides of war.
p251
aVThere is a side that fights,
p252
aVand there is a side that keeps the schools
p253
aVand the factories and the hospitals open.
p254
aVThere is a side that is focused on winning battles,
p255
aVand there is a side that is focused
p256
aVon winning life.
p257
aVThere is a side that leads the front-line discussion,
p258
aVand there is a side
p259
aVthat leads the back-line discussion.
p260
aVThere is a side that thinks
p261
aVthat peace is the end of fighting,
p262
aVand there is a side that thinks
p263
aVthat peace is the arrival
p264
aVof schools and jobs.
p265
aVThere is a side
p266
aVthat is led by men,
p267
aVand there is a side
p268
aVthat is led by women.
p269
aVAnd in order for us to understand
p270
aVhow do we build lasting peace,
p271
aVwe must understand war and peace
p272
aVfrom both sides.
p273
aVWe must have a full picture
p274
aVof what that means.
p275
aa(lp276
VIn order for us to understand
p277
aVwhat actually peace means,
p278
aVwe need to understand,
p279
aVas one Sudanese woman once told me,
p280
aV"Peace is the fact that my toenails
p281
aVare growing back again."
p282
aVShe grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan,
p283
aVfor 20 years of war,
p284
aVwhere it killed one million people
p285
aVand displaced five million refugees.
p286
aVMany women were taken as slaves
p287
aVby rebels and soldiers,
p288
aVas sexual slaves who were forced also
p289
aVto carry the ammunition and the water
p290
aVand the food for the soldiers.
p291
aVSo that woman walked for 20 years,
p292
aVso she would not be kidnapped again.
p293
aVAnd only when there was some sort of peace,
p294
aVher toenails grew back again.
p295
aVWe need to understand peace
p296
aVfrom a toenail's perspective.
p297
aa(lp298
VWe need to understand
p299
aVthat we cannot actually have negotiations
p300
aVof ending of wars or peace
p301
aVwithout fully including women
p302
aVat the negotiating table.
p303
aVI find it amazing
p304
aVthat the only group of people
p305
aVwho are not fighting and not killing
p306
aVand not pillaging and not burning and not raping,
p307
aVand the group of people who are mostly \u2014
p308
aVthough not exclusively \u2014
p309
aVwho are keeping life going in the midst of war,
p310
aVare not included in the negotiating table.
p311
aVAnd I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion,
p312
aVbut there are also men
p313
aVwho are excluded from that discussion.
p314
aVThe doctors who are not fighting,
p315
aVthe artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns,
p316
aVthey are, too, excluded
p317
aVfrom the negotiating tables.
p318
aVThere is no way we can talk about a lasting peace,
p319
aVbuilding of democracy, sustainable economies,
p320
aVany kind of stabilities,
p321
aVif we do not fully include women
p322
aVat the negotiating table.
p323
aVNot one, but 50 percent.
p324
aa(lp325
VThere is no way we can talk about the building of stability
p326
aVif we don't start investing
p327
aVin women and girls.
p328
aVDid you know
p329
aVthat one year
p330
aVof the world's military spending
p331
aVequals 700 years
p332
aVof the U.N. budget
p333
aVand equals 2,928 years
p334
aVof the U.N. budget allocated for women?
p335
aVIf we just reverse
p336
aVthat distribution of funds,
p337
aVperhaps we could have
p338
aVa better lasting peace in this world.
p339
aVAnd last, but not least,
p340
aVwe need to invest in peace and women,
p341
aVnot only because it is the right thing to do,
p342
aVnot only because it is the right thing to do,
p343
aVfor all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today,
p344
aVbut it is for the future.
p345
aa(lp346
VA Congolese woman,
p347
aVwho was telling me about
p348
aVhow her children saw their father killed in front of them
p349
aVand saw her raped in front of them
p350
aVand mutilated in front of them,
p351
aVand her children saw their nine-year-old sibling
p352
aVkilled in front of them,
p353
aVhow they're doing okay right now.
p354
aVShe got into Women for Women International's program.
p355
aVShe got a support network.
p356
aVShe learned about her rights.
p357
aVWe taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job.
p358
aVShe was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.
p359
aVShe was sending them to school. Have a new home.
p360
aVShe said, "But what I worry about the most
p361
aVis not any of that.
p362
aVI worry that my children
p363
aVhave hate in their hearts,
p364
aVand when they want to grow up, they want to fight again
p365
aVthe killers of their father and their brother."
p366
aVWe need to invest in women,
p367
aVbecause that's our only chance
p368
aVto ensure that there is no more war
p369
aVin the future.
p370
aVThat mother has a better chance to heal her children
p371
aVthan any peace agreement can do.
p372
aa(lp373
VAre there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news.
p374
aVTo start with, these women that I told you about
p375
aVare dancing and singing every single day,
p376
aVand if they can,
p377
aVwho are we not to dance?
p378
aVThat girl that I told you about
p379
aVended up starting Women for Women International Group
p380
aVthat impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars,
p381
aVand I started this from zero,
p382
aVnothing, nada, [unclear].
p383
aa(lp384
V(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
VThey are women who are standing on their feet
p387
aVin spite of their circumstances,
p388
aVnot because of it.
p389
aVThink of how the world can be a much better place
p390
aVif, for a change,
p391
aVwe have a better equality,
p392
aVwe have equality,
p393
aVwe have a representation
p394
aVand we understand war,
p395
aVboth from the front-line
p396
aVand the back-line discussion.
p397
aa(lp398
VRumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet,
p399
aVsays, "Out beyond the worlds
p400
aVof right-doings and wrong-doings,
p401
aVthere is a field.
p402
aVI will meet you there.
p403
aVWhen the soul lies down in that grass,
p404
aVthe world is too full
p405
aVto talk about.
p406
aVIdeas, language,
p407
aVeven the phrase 'each other'
p408
aVno longer makes any sense."
p409
aVI humbly add \u2014 humbly add \u2014
p410
aVthat out beyond
p411
aVthe worlds of war and peace,
p412
aVthere is a field,
p413
aVand there are many women and men
p414
aV[who] are meeting there.
p415
aVLet us make this field a much bigger place.
p416
aVLet us all meet in that field.

She left Iraq for an arranged marriage in the US, which quickly became another form of tyranny. But in 1993, when she heard of the rape and concentration camps in Bosnia, she realized she could no longer remain passive. Salbi founded Women for Women International to help women who are victims of war in every way -- from those who&#39;ve been physically harmed to those who suffer from the poverty that war and strife inevitably bring. WFWI provides economic and emotional aid, job-skills training, and rights education, empowering women to stop the cycle of violence and create social change. </p><p>In her latest book,<em>&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/hiddeninplainsight\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Other Side of War</a>,</em>&nbsp;she shares personal stories of women&#39;s experience in conflict. As she writes: &quot;War is not a computer-generated missile striking a digital map. War is the color of earth as it explodes in our faces, the sound of child pleading, the smell of smoke and fear. Women survivors of war are not the single image portrayed on the television screen, but the glue that holds families and countries together. Perhaps by understanding women, and the other side of war ... we will have more humility in our discussions of wars... perhaps it is time to listen to women&#39;s side of history.&quot;</p>", "slug": "zainab_salbi", "whotheyare": "Iraqi-born Zainab Salbi founded and runs Women for Women International, and has dedicated her life to helping women in war-torn regions rebuild their lives and communities.", "whatotherssay": "Most of all, Salbi\'s organization gives women a voice.", "id": 748, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/b35927e477cfc609c7d33c13c2791dadd9b783ac_254x191.jpg"}], "current_talk": 1013, "description": "In war we often see only the frontline stories of soldiers and combat.

She left Iraq for an arranged marriage in the US, which quickly became another form of tyranny. But in 1993, when she heard of the rape and concentration camps in Bosnia, she realized she could no longer remain passive. Salbi founded Women for Women International to help women who are victims of war in every way -- from those who&#39;ve been physically harmed to those who suffer from the poverty that war and strife inevitably bring. WFWI provides economic and emotional aid, job-skills training, and rights education, empowering women to stop the cycle of violence and create social change. </p><p>In her latest book,<em>&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/hiddeninplainsight\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Other Side of War</a>,</em>&nbsp;she shares personal stories of women&#39;s experience in conflict.

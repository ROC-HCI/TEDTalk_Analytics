VWhat does it mean to spend our time well?
p5
aVI spend a lot of my time
p6
aVthinking about how to spend my time.
p7
aVProbably too much \u2014 I probably obsess over it.
p8
aVMy friends think I do.
p9
aVBut I feel like I kind of have to, because these days,
p10
aVit feels like little bits of my time kind of slip away from me,
p11
aVand when that happens, it feels like parts of my life are slipping away.
p12
aa(lp13
VSpecifically,
p14
aVit feels like little bits of my time get slipped away
p15
aVto various things like this,
p16
aVlike technology \u2014 I check things.
p17
aVI'll give you an example.
p18
aVIf this email shows up \u2014
p19
aVhow many of you have gotten an email like this, right?
p20
aVI've been tagged in a photo.
p21
aVWhen this appears,
p22
aVI can't help but click on it right now.
p23
aVRight? Because, like, what if it's a bad photo?
p24
aVSo I have to click it right now.
p25
aVBut I'm not just going to click "See photo,"
p26
aVwhat I'm actually going to do is spend the next 20 minutes.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VBut the worst part is that I know this is what's going to happen,
p31
aVand even knowing that's what's going to happen
p32
aVdoesn't stop me from doing it again the next time.
p33
aVOr I find myself in a situation like this,
p34
aVwhere I check my email and I pull down to refresh,
p35
aVBut the thing is that 60 seconds later,
p36
aVI'll pull down to refresh again.
p37
aVWhy am I doing this?
p38
aVThis doesn't make any sense.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut I'll give you a hint why this is happening.
p41
aVWhat do you think makes more money in the United States
p42
aVthan movies, game parks and baseball combined?
p43
aVSlot machines.
p44
aVHow can slot machines make all this money
p45
aVwhen we play with such small amounts of money?
p46
aVWe play with coins.
p47
aVHow is this possible?
p48
aVWell, the thing is ...
p49
aVmy phone is a slot machine.
p50
aVEvery time I check my phone,
p51
aVI'm playing the slot machine to see,
p52
aVwhat am I going to get?
p53
aVWhat am I going to get?
p54
aVEvery time I check my email,
p55
aVI'm playing the slot machine,
p56
aVsaying, "What am I going to get?"
p57
aVEvery time I scroll a news feed,
p58
aVI'm playing the slot machine to see,
p59
aVwhat am I going to get next?
p60
aVAnd the thing is that,
p61
aVagain, knowing exactly how this works \u2014 and I'm a designer,
p62
aVI know exactly how the psychology of this works,
p63
aVI know exactly what's going on \u2014
p64
aVbut it doesn't leave me with any choice,
p65
aVI still just get sucked into it.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo what are we going to do?
p68
aVBecause it leaves us with this all-or-nothing relationship
p69
aVwith technology, right?
p70
aVYou're either on,
p71
aVand you're connected and distracted all the time,
p72
aVor you're off,
p73
aVbut then you're wondering,
p74
aVam I missing something important?
p75
aVIn other words, you're either distracted
p76
aVor you have fear of missing out.
p77
aVRight?
p78
aa(lp79
VSo we need to restore choice.
p80
aVWe want to have a relationship with technology
p81
aVthat gives us back choice about how we spend time with it,
p82
aVand we're going to need help from designers,
p83
aVbecause knowing this stuff doesn't help.
p84
aVWe're going to need design help.
p85
aVSo what would that look like?
p86
aa(lp87
VSo let's take an example that we all face:
p88
aVchat \u2014 text messaging.
p89
aVSo let's say there's two people.
p90
aVNancy's on the left and she's working on a document,
p91
aVand John's on the right.
p92
aVAnd John suddenly remembers,
p93
aV"I need to ask Nancy for that document before I forget."
p94
aVSo when he sends her that message,
p95
aVit blows away her attention.
p96
aa(lp97
VThat's what we're doing all the time, bulldozing each other's attention,
p98
aVleft and right.
p99
aVAnd there's serious cost to this,
p100
aVbecause every time we interrupt each other,
p101
aVit takes us about 23 minutes, on average,
p102
aVto refocus our attention.
p103
aVWe actually cycle through two different projects
p104
aVbefore we come back to the original thing we were doing.
p105
aVThis is Gloria Mark's research combined with Microsoft research,
p106
aVthat showed this.
p107
aVAnd her research also shows that it actually trains bad habits.
p108
aVThe more interruptions we get externally,
p109
aVit's conditioning and training us to interrupt ourselves.
p110
aVWe actually self-interrupt every three-and-a-half minutes.
p111
aa(lp112
VThis is crazy.
p113
aVSo how do we fix this?
p114
aVBecause Nancy and John are in this all-or-nothing relationship.
p115
aVNancy might want to disconnect,
p116
aVbut then she'd be worried:
p117
aVWhat if I'm missing something important?
p118
aa(lp119
VDesign can fix this problem.
p120
aVLet's say you have Nancy again on the left,
p121
aVJohn on the right.
p122
aVAnd John remembers, "I need to send Nancy that document."
p123
aVExcept this time,
p124
aVNancy can mark that she's focused.
p125
aVLet's say she drags a slider and says,
p126
aV"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,"
p127
aVso \u2014 bam \u2014 she's focused.
p128
aVNow when John wants to message her,
p129
aVhe can get the thought off of his mind \u2014
p130
aVbecause he has a need, he has this thought,
p131
aVand he needs to dump it out before he forgets.
p132
aVExcept this time,
p133
aVit holds the messages so that Nancy can still focus,
p134
aVbut John can get the thought off of his mind.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut this only works if one last thing is true,
p137
aVwhich is that Nancy needs to know that if something is truly important,
p138
aVJohn can still interrupt.
p139
aVBut instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions,
p140
aVwe're now only creating conscious interruptions,
p141
aa(lp142
VSo we're doing two things here.
p143
aVWe're creating a new choice for both Nancy and John,
p144
aVBut there's a second, subtle thing we're doing here, too.
p145
aVAnd it's that we're changing the question we're answering.
p146
aVInstead of the goal of chat being:
p147
aV"Let's design it so it's easy to send a message" \u2014
p148
aVthat's the goal of chat,
p149
aVit should be really easy to send a message to someone \u2014
p150
aVwe change the goal to something deeper and a human value,
p151
aVwhich is: "Let's create the highest possible quality communication
p152
aVin a relationship between two people.
p153
aVSo we upgraded the goal.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, do designers actually care about this?
p156
aVDo we want to have conversations about what these deeper human goals are?
p157
aVWell, I'll tell you one story.
p158
aVA little over a year ago,
p159
aVI got to help organize a meeting
p160
aVbetween some of technology's leading designers and Thich Nhat Hanh.
p161
aVThich Nhat Hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness meditation.
p162
aVAnd it was the most amazing meeting.
p163
aVYou have to imagine \u2014 picture a room \u2014
p164
aVon one side of the room, you have a bunch of tech geeks;
p165
aVon the other side of the room,
p166
aVyou have a bunch of long brown robes, shaved heads, Buddhist monks.
p167
aVAnd the questions were about the deepest human values,
p168
aVlike what does the future of technology look like
p169
aVwhen you're designing for the deepest questions
p170
aVand the deepest human values?
p171
aVAnd our conversation centered on listening more deeply
p172
aVto what those values might be.
p173
aVHe joked in our conversation
p174
aVthat what if, instead of a spell check,
p175
aVyou had a compassion check,
p176
aVmeaning, you might highlight a word that might be accidentally abrasive \u2014
p177
aVperceived as abrasive by someone else.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo does this kind of conversation happen in the real world,
p180
aVnot just in these design meetings?
p181
aVWell, the answer is yes,
p182
aVand one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.
p183
aVIf you didn't know, Couchsurfing is a website
p184
aVthat matches people who are looking for a place to stay
p185
aVwith a free couch, from someone who's trying to offer it.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo, great service \u2014
p188
aVwhat would their design goal be?
p189
aVWhat are you designing for if you work at Couchsurfing?
p190
aVWell, you would think it's to match guests with hosts.
p191
aVRight?
p192
aVThat's a pretty good goal.
p193
aVBut that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before,
p194
aVwhere we're just trying to deliver a message.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo what's the deeper, human goal?
p197
aVWell, they set their goal
p198
aVas the need to create lasting, positive experiences and relationships
p199
aVbetween people who've never met before.
p200
aVAnd the most amazing thing about this was in 2007,
p201
aVthey introduced a way to measure this,
p202
aVwhich is incredible.
p203
aVI'll tell you how it works.
p204
aVFor every design goal you have,
p205
aVyou have to have a corresponding measurement
p206
aVto know how you're doing \u2014
p207
aVa way of measuring success.
p208
aVSo what they do is,
p209
aVlet's say you take two people who meet up,
p210
aVand they take the number of days those two people spent together,
p211
aVand then they estimate how many hours were in those days \u2014
p212
aVhow many hours did those two people spend together?
p213
aVAnd then after they spend that time together,
p214
aVthey ask both of them:
p215
aVHow positive was your experience?
p216
aVDid you have a good experience with this person that you met?
p217
aVAnd they subtract from those positive hours
p218
aVthe amount of time people spent on the website,
p219
aVbecause that's a cost to people's lives.
p220
aVWhy should we value that as success?
p221
aVAnd what you were left with
p222
aVis something they refer to as "net orchestrated conviviality,"
p223
aVor, really, just a net "Good Times" created.
p224
aVThe net hours that would have never existed, had Couchsurfing not existed.
p225
aa(lp226
VCan you imagine how inspiring it would be to come to work every day
p227
aVand measure your success
p228
aVin the actual net new contribution of hours in people's lives
p229
aVthat are positive, that would have never existed
p230
aVif you didn't do what you were about to do at work today?
p231
aVCan you imagine a whole world that worked this way?
p232
aa(lp233
VCan you imagine a social network that \u2014
p234
aVlet's say you care about cooking,
p235
aVand it measured its success in terms of cooking nights organized
p236
aVand the cooking articles that you were glad you read,
p237
aVand subtracted from that the articles you weren't glad you read
p238
aVor the time you spent scrolling that you didn't like?
p239
aVImagine a professional social network
p240
aVthat, instead of measuring its success in terms of connections created
p241
aVor messages sent,
p242
aVinstead measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got
p243
aVthat they were excited to get.
p244
aVAnd subtracted the amount of time people spent on the website.
p245
aVOr imagine dating services,
p246
aVlike maybe Tinder or something,
p247
aVwhere instead of measuring the number of swipes left and right people did,
p248
aVwhich is how they measure success today,
p249
aVinstead measured the deep, romantic, fulfilling connections people created.
p250
aVWhatever that was for them, by the way.
p251
aa(lp252
VBut can you imagine a whole world that worked this way,
p253
aVthat was helping you spend your time well?
p254
aVNow to do this you also need a new system,
p255
aVbecause you're probably thinking,
p256
aVtoday's Internet economy \u2014
p257
aVtoday's economy in general \u2014
p258
aVis measured in time spent.
p259
aVThe more users you have,
p260
aVthe more usage you have,
p261
aVthe more time people spend,
p262
aVthat's how we measure success.
p263
aa(lp264
VBut we've solved this problem before.
p265
aVWe solved it with organic,
p266
aVwhen we said we need to value things a different way.
p267
aVWe said this is a different kind of food.
p268
aVSo we can't compare it just based on price;
p269
aVthis is a different category of food.
p270
aVWe solved it with Leed Certification,
p271
aVwhere we said this is a different kind of building
p272
aVthat stood for different values of environmental sustainability.
p273
aa(lp274
VWhat if we had something like that for technology?
p275
aVWhat if we had something whose entire purpose and goal
p276
aVwas to help create net new positive contributions to human life?
p277
aVAnd what if we could value it a different way,
p278
aVso it would actually work?
p279
aVImagine you gave this different premium shelf space on app stores.
p280
aVImagine you had web browsers that helped route you
p281
aVto these kinds of design products.
p282
aVCan you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create that world?
p283
aa(lp284
VWe can create this world today.
p285
aVCompany leaders, all you have to do \u2014
p286
aVonly you can prioritize a new metric,
p287
aVwhich is your metric for net positive contribution to human life.
p288
aVAnd have an honest conversation about that.
p289
aVMaybe you're not doing so well to start with,
p290
aVbut let's start that conversation.
p291
aa(lp292
VDesigners, you can redefine success; you can redefine design.
p293
aVArguably, you have more power than many people in your organization
p294
aVto create the choices that all of us live by.
p295
aVMaybe like in medicine,
p296
aVwhere we have a Hippocratic oath
p297
aVto recognize the responsibility and this higher value
p298
aVthat we have to treat patients.
p299
aVWhat if designers had something like that,
p300
aVin terms of this new kind of design?
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd users, for all of us \u2014
p303
aVwe can demand technology that works this way.
p304
aVNow it may seem hard,
p305
aVbut McDonald's didn't have salads until the consumer demand was there.
p306
aVWalmart didn't have organic food until the consumer demand was there.
p307
aVWe have to demand this new kind of technology.
p308
aVAnd we can do that.
p309
aVAnd doing that
p310
aVwould amount to shifting from a world that's driven and run
p311
aVentirely on time spent,
p312
aVto world that's driven by time well spent.
p313
aa(lp314
VI want to live in this world,
p315
aVand I want this conversation to happen.
p316
aVLet's start that conversation now.
p317
aa(lp318
VThank you.

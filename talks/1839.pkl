V"Iran is Israel's best friend,
p5
aVand we do not intend to change our position
p6
aVin relation to Tehran."
p7
aa(lp8
VBelieve it or not, this is a quote
p9
aVfrom an Israeli prime minister,
p10
aVbut it's not Ben-Gurion or Golda Meir
p11
aVfrom the era of the Shah.
p12
aVIt's actually from Yitzhak Rabin.
p13
aVThe year is 1987.
p14
aVAyatollah Khomeini is still alive,
p15
aVand much like Ahmadinejad today,
p16
aVhe's using the worst rhetoric against Israel.
p17
aVYet, Rabin referred to Iran
p18
aVas a geostrategic friend.
p19
aa(lp20
VToday, when we hear the threats of war
p21
aVand the high rhetoric,
p22
aVwe're oftentimes led to believe
p23
aVthat this is yet another one of those unsolvable
p24
aVMiddle Eastern conflicts
p25
aVwith roots as old as the region itself.
p26
aVNothing could be further from the truth,
p27
aVand I hope today to show you why that is.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people
p30
aVthroughout history has actually been quite positive,
p31
aVstarting in 539 B.C.,
p32
aVwhen King Cyrus the Great of Persia
p33
aVliberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity.
p34
aVA third of the Jewish population
p35
aVstayed in Babylonia.
p36
aVThey're today's Iraqi Jews.
p37
aVA third migrated to Persia.
p38
aVThey're today's Iranian Jews,
p39
aVstill 25,000 of them living in Iran,
p40
aVmaking them the largest Jewish community
p41
aVin the Middle East outside of Israel itself.
p42
aVAnd a third returned to historic Palestine,
p43
aVdid the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem,
p44
aVfinanced, incidentally, by Persian tax money.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut even in modern times,
p47
aVrelations have been close at times.
p48
aVRabin's statement was a reflection
p49
aVof decades of security and intelligence collaboration
p50
aVbetween the two, which in turn
p51
aVwas born out of perception of common threats.
p52
aVBoth states feared the Soviet Union
p53
aVand strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq.
p54
aVAnd, in addition, the Israeli doctrine of the periphery,
p55
aVthe idea that Israel's security was best achieved
p56
aVby creating alliances with the non-Arab states
p57
aVin the periphery of the region
p58
aVin order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity.
p59
aVNow, from the Shah's perspective, though,
p60
aVhe wanted to keep this as secret as possible,
p61
aVso when Yitzhak Rabin, for instance,
p62
aVtraveled to Iran in the '70s,
p63
aVhe usually wore a wig
p64
aVso that no one would recognize him.
p65
aVThe Iranians built a special tarmac
p66
aVat the airport in Tehran, far away from the central terminal,
p67
aVso that no one would notice the large number
p68
aVof Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, did all of this end with the Islamic revolution
p71
aVin 1979?
p72
aVIn spite of the very clear anti-Israeli ideology
p73
aVof the new regime, the geopolitical logic
p74
aVfor their collaboration lived on,
p75
aVbecause they still had common threats.
p76
aVAnd when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980,
p77
aVIsrael feared an Iraqi victory
p78
aVand actively helped Iran by selling it arms
p79
aVand providing it with spare parts
p80
aVfor Iran's American weaponry
p81
aVat a moment when Iran was very vulnerable
p82
aVbecause of an American arms embargo
p83
aVthat Israel was more than happy to violate.
p84
aVIn fact, back in the 1980s,
p85
aVit was Israel that lobbied Washington
p86
aVto talk to Iran, to sell arms to Iran,
p87
aVand not pay attention to Iran's anti-Israeli ideology.
p88
aVAnd this, of course, climaxed
p89
aVin the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut with the end of the Cold War
p92
aVcame also the end of the Israeli-Iranian cold peace.
p93
aVSuddenly, the two common threats
p94
aVthat had pushed them closer together throughout decades,
p95
aVmore or less evaporated.
p96
aVThe Soviet Union collapsed,
p97
aVIraq was defeated,
p98
aVand a new environment was created in the region
p99
aVin which both of them felt more secure,
p100
aVbut they were also now left unchecked.
p101
aVWithout Iraq balancing Iran,
p102
aVIran could now become a threat,
p103
aVsome in Israel argued.
p104
aVIn fact, the current dynamic
p105
aVthat you see between Iran and Israel
p106
aVhas its roots more so
p107
aVin the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region
p108
aVafter the Cold War
p109
aVthan in the events of 1979,
p110
aVbecause at this point, Iran and Israel
p111
aVemerge as two of the most powerful states in the region,
p112
aVand rather than viewing each other
p113
aVas potential security partners,
p114
aVthey increasingly came to view each other
p115
aVas rivals and competitors.
p116
aVSo Israel, who in the 1980s
p117
aVlobbied for and improved U.S.-Iran relations
p118
aVnow feared a U.S.-Iran rapprochement,
p119
aVthinking that it would come
p120
aVat Israel's security interests' expense,
p121
aVand instead sought to put Iran
p122
aVin increased isolation.
p123
aa(lp124
VIronically, this was happening at a time
p125
aVwhen Iran was more interested
p126
aVin peacemaking with Washington
p127
aVthan to see to Israel's destruction.
p128
aVIran had put itself in isolation
p129
aVbecause of its radicalism,
p130
aVand after having helped the United States indirectly
p131
aVin the war against Iraq in 1991,
p132
aVthe Iranians were hoping
p133
aVthat they would be rewarded by being included
p134
aVin the post-war security architecture of the region.
p135
aVBut Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach,
p136
aVas it would a decade later in Afghanistan,
p137
aVand instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation,
p138
aVand it is at this point, around 1993, '94,
p139
aVthat Iran begins to translate
p140
aVits anti-Israeli ideology
p141
aVinto operational policy.
p142
aVThe Iranians believed that whatever they did,
p143
aVeven if they moderated their policies,
p144
aVthe U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation,
p145
aVand the only way Iran could compel Washington
p146
aVto change its position was by imposing a cost
p147
aVon the U.S. if it didn't.
p148
aVThe easiest target was the peace process,
p149
aVand now the Iranian ideological bark
p150
aVwas to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite,
p151
aVand Iran began supporting extensively
p152
aVPalestinian Islamist groups that it previously
p153
aVhad shunned.
p154
aVIn some ways, this sounds paradoxical,
p155
aVbut according to Martin Indyk
p156
aVof the Clinton administration,
p157
aVthe Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong,
p158
aVbecause the more peace there would be
p159
aVbetween Israel and Palestine,
p160
aVthe U.S. believed, the more Iran would get isolated.
p161
aVThe more Iran got isolated, the more peace there would be.
p162
aVSo according to Indyk, and these are his words,
p163
aVthe Iranians had an interest to do us in
p164
aVon the peace process
p165
aVin order to defeat our policy of containment.
p166
aVTo defeat our policy of containment,
p167
aVnot about ideology.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut throughout even the worst times of their entanglement,
p170
aVall sides have reached out to each other.
p171
aVNetanyahu, when he got elected in 1996,
p172
aVreached out to the Iranians to see
p173
aVif there were any ways that
p174
aVthe doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected.
p175
aVTehran was not interested.
p176
aVA few years later, the Iranians sent
p177
aVa comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration,
p178
aVa proposal that revealed that there was some potential
p179
aVof getting Iran and Israel back on terms again.
p180
aVThe Bush administration did not even respond.
p181
aVAll sides have never missed an opportunity
p182
aVto miss an opportunity.
p183
aa(lp184
VBut this is not an ancient conflict.
p185
aVThis is not even an ideological conflict.
p186
aVThe ebbs and flows of hostility
p187
aVhave not shifted with ideological zeal,
p188
aVbut rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape.
p189
aVWhen Iran and Israel's security imperatives
p190
aVdictated collaboration, they did so
p191
aVin spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other.
p192
aVWhen Iran's ideological impulses collided
p193
aVwith its strategic interests,
p194
aVthe strategic interests always prevailed.
p195
aVThis is good news, because it means
p196
aVthat neither war nor enmity
p197
aVis a foregone conclusion.
p198
aa(lp199
VBut some want war.
p200
aVSome believe or say that it's 1938,
p201
aVIran is Germany,
p202
aVand Ahmadinejad is Hitler.
p203
aVIf we accept this to be true,
p204
aVthat indeed it is 1938, Iran is Germany,
p205
aVAhmadinejad is Hitler,
p206
aVthen the question we have to ask ourself is,
p207
aVwho wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain?
p208
aVWho will risk peace?
p209
aVThis is an analogy that is deliberately aimed
p210
aVat eliminating diplomacy,
p211
aVand when you eliminate diplomacy,
p212
aVyou make war inevitable.
p213
aVIn an ideological conflict, there can be no truce,
p214
aVno draw, no compromise,
p215
aVonly victory or defeat.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut rather than making war inevitable
p218
aVby viewing this as ideological,
p219
aVwe would be wise to seek ways
p220
aVto make peace possible.
p221
aVIran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon,
p222
aVonly a few decades old
p223
aVin a history of 2,500 years,
p224
aVand precisely because its roots are geopolitical,
p225
aVit means that solutions can be found,
p226
aVcompromises can be struck,
p227
aVhowever difficult it yet may be.
p228
aVAfter all, it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said,
p229
aV"You don't make peace with your friends.
p230
aVYou make it with your enemies."
p231
aa(lp232
VThank you.

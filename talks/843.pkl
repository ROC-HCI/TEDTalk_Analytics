VSo I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.
p5
aVActually, I think it'll eventually
p6
aVbe seen as probably the single biggest idea
p7
aVthat's emerged in the past century.
p8
aVIt's the idea of computation.
p9
aVNow, of course, that idea has brought us
p10
aVall of the computer technology we have today and so on.
p11
aVBut there's actually a lot more to computation than that.
p12
aVIt's really a very deep, very powerful, very fundamental idea,
p13
aVwhose effects we've only just begun to see.
p14
aa(lp15
VWell, I myself have spent the past 30 years of my life
p16
aVworking on three large projects
p17
aVthat really try to take the idea of computation seriously.
p18
aVSo I started off at a young age as a physicist
p19
aVusing computers as tools.
p20
aVThen, I started drilling down,
p21
aVthinking about the computations I might want to do,
p22
aVtrying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from
p23
aVand how they could be automated as much as possible.
p24
aVEventually, I created a whole structure
p25
aVbased on symbolic programming and so on
p26
aVthat let me build Mathematica.
p27
aVAnd for the past 23 years, at an increasing rate,
p28
aVwe've been pouring more and more ideas
p29
aVand capabilities and so on into Mathematica,
p30
aVand I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things
p31
aVin R & D and education,
p32
aVlots of other areas.
p33
aVWell, I have to admit, actually,
p34
aVthat I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica:
p35
aVI wanted to use it myself,
p36
aVa bit like Galileo got to use his telescope
p37
aV400 years ago.
p38
aVBut I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe,
p39
aVbut at the computational universe.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo we normally think of programs as being
p42
aVcomplicated things that we build
p43
aVfor very specific purposes.
p44
aVBut what about the space of all possible programs?
p45
aVHere's a representation of a really simple program.
p46
aVSo, if we run this program,
p47
aVthis is what we get.
p48
aVVery simple.
p49
aVSo let's try changing the rule
p50
aVfor this program a little bit.
p51
aVNow we get another result,
p52
aVstill very simple.
p53
aVTry changing it again.
p54
aVYou get something a little bit more complicated.
p55
aVBut if we keep running this for a while,
p56
aVwe find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate,
p57
aVit has a very regular structure.
p58
aVSo the question is: Can anything else happen?
p59
aVWell, we can do a little experiment.
p60
aVLet's just do a little mathematical experiment, try and find out.
p61
aa(lp62
VLet's just run all possible programs
p63
aVof the particular type that we're looking at.
p64
aVThey're called cellular automata.
p65
aVYou can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here.
p66
aVMost of them do very simple things,
p67
aVbut if you look along all these different pictures,
p68
aVat rule number 30,
p69
aVyou start to see something interesting going on.
p70
aVSo let's take a closer look
p71
aVat rule number 30 here.
p72
aVSo here it is.
p73
aVWe're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here,
p74
aVbut we're getting all this amazing stuff.
p75
aVIt's not at all what we're used to,
p76
aVand I must say that, when I first saw this,
p77
aVit came as a huge shock to my intuition.
p78
aVAnd, in fact, to understand it,
p79
aVI eventually had to create
p80
aVa whole new kind of science.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VThis science is different, more general,
p85
aVthan the mathematics-based science that we've had
p86
aVfor the past 300 or so years.
p87
aVYou know, it's always seemed like a big mystery:
p88
aVhow nature, seemingly so effortlessly,
p89
aVmanages to produce so much
p90
aVthat seems to us so complex.
p91
aVWell, I think we've found its secret:
p92
aVIt's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe
p93
aVand quite often getting things like Rule 30
p94
aVor like this.
p95
aVAnd knowing that starts to explain
p96
aVa lot of long-standing mysteries in science.
p97
aVIt also brings up new issues, though,
p98
aVlike computational irreducibility.
p99
aVI mean, we're used to having science let us predict things,
p100
aVbut something like this
p101
aVis fundamentally irreducible.
p102
aVThe only way to find its outcome
p103
aVis, effectively, just to watch it evolve.
p104
aVIt's connected to, what I call,
p105
aVthe principle of computational equivalence,
p106
aVwhich tells us that even incredibly simple systems
p107
aVcan do computations as sophisticated as anything.
p108
aVIt doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution
p109
aVto be able to do arbitrary computation;
p110
aVjust something that happens, naturally,
p111
aVall over the place.
p112
aVThings with rules as simple as these can do it.
p113
aVWell, this has deep implications
p114
aVabout the limits of science,
p115
aVabout predictability and controllability
p116
aVof things like biological processes or economies,
p117
aVabout intelligence in the universe,
p118
aVabout questions like free will
p119
aVand about creating technology.
p120
aa(lp121
VYou know, in working on this science for many years,
p122
aVI kept wondering,
p123
aV"What will be its first killer app?"
p124
aVWell, ever since I was a kid,
p125
aVI'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge
p126
aVand somehow making it computable.
p127
aVPeople like Leibniz had wondered about that too
p128
aV300 years earlier.
p129
aVBut I'd always assumed that to make progress,
p130
aVI'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain.
p131
aVWell, then I got to thinking:
p132
aVThis scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different \u2014
p133
aVand, by the way, I've now got
p134
aVhuge computation capabilities in Mathematica,
p135
aVand I'm a CEO with some worldly resources
p136
aVto do large, seemingly crazy, projects \u2014
p137
aVSo I decided to just try to see
p138
aVhow much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world
p139
aVwe could make computable.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo, it's been a big, very complex project,
p142
aVwhich I was not sure was going to work at all.
p143
aVBut I'm happy to say it's actually going really well.
p144
aVAnd last year we were able
p145
aVto release the first website version
p146
aVof Wolfram Alpha.
p147
aVIts purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine
p148
aVthat computes answers to questions.
p149
aVSo let's give it a try.
p150
aVLet's start off with something really easy.
p151
aVHope for the best.
p152
aVVery good. Okay.
p153
aVSo far so good.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVLet's try something a little bit harder.
p156
aVLet's do
p157
aVsome mathy thing,
p158
aVand with luck it'll work out the answer
p159
aVand try and tell us some interesting things
p160
aVthings about related math.
p161
aVWe could ask it something about the real world.
p162
aVLet's say \u2014 I don't know \u2014
p163
aVwhat's the GDP of Spain?
p164
aVAnd it should be able to tell us that.
p165
aVNow we could compute something related to this,
p166
aVlet's say ... the GDP of Spain
p167
aVdivided by, I don't know,
p168
aVthe \u2014 hmmm ...
p169
aVlet's say the revenue of Microsoft.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VThe idea is that we can just type this in,
p174
aVthis kind of question in, however we think of it.
p175
aVSo let's try asking a question,
p176
aVlike a health related question.
p177
aVSo let's say we have a lab finding that ...
p178
aVyou know, we have an LDL level of 140
p179
aVfor a male aged 50.
p180
aVSo let's type that in, and now Wolfram Alpha
p181
aVwill go and use available public health data
p182
aVand try and figure out
p183
aVwhat part of the population that corresponds to and so on.
p184
aVOr let's try asking about, I don't know,
p185
aVthe International Space Station.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd what's happening here is that
p188
aVWolfram Alpha is not just looking up something;
p189
aVit's computing, in real time,
p190
aVwhere the International Space Station is right now at this moment,
p191
aVhow fast it's going, and so on.
p192
aVSo Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things.
p193
aVIt's got, by now,
p194
aVpretty good coverage of everything you might find
p195
aVin a standard reference library.
p196
aVBut the goal is to go much further
p197
aVand, very broadly, to democratize
p198
aVall of this knowledge,
p199
aVand to try and be an authoritative
p200
aVsource in all areas.
p201
aVTo be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have,
p202
aVnot by searching what other people
p203
aVmay have written down before,
p204
aVbut by using built in knowledge
p205
aVto compute fresh new answers to specific questions.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, of course, Wolfram Alpha
p208
aVis a monumentally huge, long-term project
p209
aVwith lots and lots of challenges.
p210
aVFor a start, one has to curate a zillion
p211
aVdifferent sources of facts and data,
p212
aVand we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation
p213
aVand human domain experts for doing this.
p214
aVBut that's just the beginning.
p215
aVGiven raw facts or data
p216
aVto actually answer questions,
p217
aVone has to compute:
p218
aVone has to implement all those methods and models
p219
aVand algorithms and so on
p220
aVthat science and other areas have built up over the centuries.
p221
aVWell, even starting from Mathematica,
p222
aVthis is still a huge amount of work.
p223
aVSo far, there are about 8 million lines
p224
aVof Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha
p225
aVbuilt by experts from many, many different fields.
p226
aa(lp227
VWell, a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha
p228
aVis that you can just ask it questions
p229
aVusing ordinary human language,
p230
aVwhich means that we've got to be able to take
p231
aVall those strange utterances that people type into the input field
p232
aVand understand them.
p233
aVAnd I must say that I thought that step
p234
aVmight just be plain impossible.
p235
aVTwo big things happened:
p236
aVFirst, a bunch of new ideas about linguistics
p237
aVthat came from studying the computational universe;
p238
aVand second, the realization that having actual computable knowledge
p239
aVcompletely changes how one can
p240
aVset about understanding language.
p241
aVAnd, of course, now
p242
aVwith Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild,
p243
aVwe can learn from its actual usage.
p244
aVAnd, in fact, there's been
p245
aVan interesting coevolution that's been going on
p246
aVbetween Wolfram Alpha
p247
aVand its human users,
p248
aVand it's really encouraging.
p249
aVRight now, if we look at web queries,
p250
aVmore than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time.
p251
aVAnd if you look at things like the iPhone app,
p252
aVthe fraction is considerably larger.
p253
aVSo, I'm pretty pleased with it all.
p254
aa(lp255
VBut, in many ways,
p256
aVwe're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha.
p257
aVI mean, everything is scaling up very nicely
p258
aVand we're getting more confident.
p259
aVYou can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology
p260
aVshowing up in more and more places,
p261
aVworking both with this kind of public data, like on the website,
p262
aVand with private knowledge
p263
aVfor people and companies and so on.
p264
aVYou know, I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one
p265
aVa whole new kind of computing
p266
aVthat one can call knowledge-based computing,
p267
aVin which one's starting not just from raw computation,
p268
aVbut from a vast amount of built-in knowledge.
p269
aVAnd when one does that, one really changes
p270
aVthe economics of delivering computational things,
p271
aVwhether it's on the web or elsewhere.
p272
aa(lp273
VYou know, we have a fairly interesting situation right now.
p274
aVOn the one hand, we have Mathematica,
p275
aVwith its sort of precise, formal language
p276
aVand a huge network
p277
aVof carefully designed capabilities
p278
aVable to get a lot done in just a few lines.
p279
aVLet me show you a couple of examples here.
p280
aVSo here's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming.
p281
aVHere's something where we're sort of
p282
aVintegrating a bunch of different capabilities here.
p283
aVHere we'll just create, in this line,
p284
aVa little user interface that allows us to
p285
aVdo something fun there.
p286
aVIf you go on, that's a slightly more complicated program
p287
aVthat's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things
p288
aVand creating user interface and so on.
p289
aVBut it's something that is very precise stuff.
p290
aVIt's a precise specification with a precise formal language
p291
aVthat causes Mathematica to know what to do here.
p292
aa(lp293
VThen on the other hand, we have Wolfram Alpha,
p294
aVwith all the messiness of the world
p295
aVand human language and so on built into it.
p296
aVSo what happens when you put these things together?
p297
aVI think it's actually rather wonderful.
p298
aVWith Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica,
p299
aVyou can, for example, make precise programs
p300
aVthat call on real world data.
p301
aVHere's a real simple example.
p302
aVYou can also just sort of give vague input
p303
aVand then try and have Wolfram Alpha
p304
aVfigure out what you're talking about.
p305
aVLet's try this here.
p306
aVBut actually I think the most exciting thing about this
p307
aVis that it really gives one the chance
p308
aVto democratize programming.
p309
aVI mean, anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language.
p310
aVThen, the idea is that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out
p311
aVwhat precise pieces of code
p312
aVcan do what they're asking for
p313
aVand then show them examples that will let them pick what they need
p314
aVto build up bigger and bigger, precise programs.
p315
aVSo, sometimes, Wolfram Alpha
p316
aVwill be able to do the whole thing immediately
p317
aVand just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with.
p318
aVHere's a big website
p319
aVwhere we've been collecting lots of educational
p320
aVand other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things.
p321
aVI'll show you one example here.
p322
aVThis is just an example of one of these computable documents.
p323
aVThis is probably a fairly small
p324
aVpiece of Mathematica code
p325
aVthat's able to be run here.
p326
aa(lp327
VOkay. Let's zoom out again.
p328
aVSo, given our new kind of science,
p329
aVis there a general way to use it to make technology?
p330
aVSo, with physical materials,
p331
aVwe're used to going around the world
p332
aVand discovering that particular materials
p333
aVare useful for particular
p334
aVtechnological purposes.
p335
aVWell, it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing
p336
aVin the computational universe.
p337
aVThere's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there.
p338
aVThe challenge is to see how to
p339
aVharness them for human purposes.
p340
aVSomething like Rule 30, for example,
p341
aVturns out to be a really good randomness generator.
p342
aVOther simple programs are good models
p343
aVfor processes in the natural or social world.
p344
aVAnd, for example, Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica
p345
aVare actually now full of algorithms
p346
aVthat we discovered by searching the computational universe.
p347
aVAnd, for example, this \u2014 if we go back here \u2014
p348
aVthis has become surprisingly popular
p349
aVamong composers
p350
aVfinding musical forms by searching the computational universe.
p351
aVIn a sense, we can use the computational universe
p352
aVto get mass customized creativity.
p353
aVI'm hoping we can, for example,
p354
aVuse that even to get Wolfram Alpha
p355
aVto routinely do invention and discovery on the fly,
p356
aVand to find all sorts of wonderful stuff
p357
aVthat no engineer
p358
aVand no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with.
p359
aa(lp360
VWell, so, that leads to kind of an ultimate question:
p361
aVCould it be that someplace out there in the computational universe
p362
aVwe might find our physical universe?
p363
aVPerhaps there's even some quite simple rule,
p364
aVsome simple program for our universe.
p365
aVWell, the history of physics would have us believe
p366
aVthat the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated.
p367
aVBut in the computational universe,
p368
aVwe've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple
p369
aVcan produce incredibly rich and complex behavior.
p370
aVSo could that be what's going on with our whole universe?
p371
aVIf the rules for the universe are simple,
p372
aVit's kind of inevitable that they have to be
p373
aVvery abstract and very low level;
p374
aVoperating, for example, far below
p375
aVthe level of space or time,
p376
aVwhich makes it hard to represent things.
p377
aVBut in at least a large class of cases,
p378
aVone can think of the universe as being
p379
aVlike some kind of network,
p380
aVwhich, when it gets big enough,
p381
aVbehaves like continuous space
p382
aVin much the same way as having lots of molecules
p383
aVcan behave like a continuous fluid.
p384
aVWell, then the universe has to evolve by applying
p385
aVlittle rules that progressively update this network.
p386
aVAnd each possible rule, in a sense,
p387
aVcorresponds to a candidate universe.
p388
aa(lp389
VActually, I haven't shown these before,
p390
aVbut here are a few of the candidate universes
p391
aVthat I've looked at.
p392
aVSome of these are hopeless universes,
p393
aVcompletely sterile,
p394
aVwith other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space,
p395
aVno notion of time, no matter,
p396
aVother problems like that.
p397
aVBut the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years
p398
aVis that you actually don't have to go very far
p399
aVin the computational universe
p400
aVbefore you start finding candidate universes
p401
aVthat aren't obviously not our universe.
p402
aVHere's the problem:
p403
aVAny serious candidate for our universe
p404
aVis inevitably full of computational irreducibility.
p405
aVWhich means that it is irreducibly difficult
p406
aVto find out how it will really behave,
p407
aVand whether it matches our physical universe.
p408
aVA few years ago, I was pretty excited to discover
p409
aVthat there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules
p410
aVthat successfully reproduce special relativity,
p411
aVand even general relativity and gravitation,
p412
aVand at least give hints of quantum mechanics.
p413
aVSo, will we find the whole of physics?
p414
aVI don't know for sure,
p415
aVbut I think at this point it's sort of
p416
aValmost embarrassing not to at least try.
p417
aa(lp418
VNot an easy project.
p419
aVOne's got to build a lot of technology.
p420
aVOne's got to build a structure that's probably
p421
aVat least as deep as existing physics.
p422
aVAnd I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is.
p423
aVBuild a team, open it up, offer prizes and so on.
p424
aVBut I'll tell you, here today,
p425
aVthat I'm committed to seeing this project done,
p426
aVto see if, within this decade,
p427
aVwe can finally hold in our hands
p428
aVthe rule for our universe
p429
aVand know where our universe lies
p430
aVin the space of all possible universes ...
p431
aVand be able to type into Wolfram Alpha, "the theory of the universe,"
p432
aVand have it tell us.
p433
aa(lp434
V(Laughter)
p435
aa(lp436
VSo I've been working on the idea of computation
p437
aVnow for more than 30 years,
p438
aVbuilding tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas
p439
aVinto millions of lines of code
p440
aVand grist for server farms and so on.
p441
aVWith every passing year,
p442
aVI realize how much more powerful
p443
aVthe idea of computation really is.
p444
aVIt's taken us a long way already,
p445
aVbut there's so much more to come.
p446
aVFrom the foundations of science
p447
aVto the limits of technology
p448
aVto the very definition of the human condition,
p449
aVI think computation is destined to be
p450
aVthe defining idea of our future.
p451
aa(lp452
VThank you.
p453
aa(lp454
V(Applause)
p455
aa(lp456
VChris Anderson: That was astonishing.
p457
aVStay here. I've got a question.
p458
aa(lp459
V(Applause)
p460
aa(lp461
VSo, that was, fair to say, an astonishing talk.
p462
aVAre you able to say in a sentence or two
p463
aVhow this type of thinking
p464
aVcould integrate at some point
p465
aVto things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of
p466
aVas the fundamental explanations of the universe?
p467
aa(lp468
VStephen Wolfram: Well, the parts of physics
p469
aVthat we kind of know to be true,
p470
aVthings like the standard model of physics:
p471
aVwhat I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics
p472
aVor it's simply wrong.
p473
aVThe things that people have tried to do in the last 25 years or so
p474
aVwith string theory and so on
p475
aVhave been an interesting exploration
p476
aVthat has tried to get back to the standard model,
p477
aVbut hasn't quite gotten there.
p478
aVMy guess is that some great simplifications of what I'm doing
p479
aVmay actually have considerable resonance
p480
aVwith what's been done in string theory,
p481
aVbut that's a complicated math thing
p482
aVthat I don't yet know how it's going to work out.
p483
aa(lp484
VCA: Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience.
p485
aVHe also has shown how complexity
p486
aVcan arise out of a simple start.
p487
aVDoes your work relate to his?
p488
aa(lp489
VSW: I think so.
p490
aVI view Benoit Mandelbrot's work
p491
aVas one of the founding contributions
p492
aVto this kind of area.
p493
aVBenoit has been particularly interested
p494
aVin nested patterns, in fractals and so on,
p495
aVwhere the structure is something
p496
aVthat's kind of tree-like,
p497
aVand where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches
p498
aVand even smaller branches and so on.
p499
aVThat's one of the ways
p500
aVthat you get towards true complexity.
p501
aVI think things like the Rule 30 cellular automaton
p502
aVget us to a different level.
p503
aVIn fact, in a very precise way, they get us to a different level
p504
aVbecause they seem to be things that are
p505
aVcapable of complexity
p506
aVthat's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ...
p507
aa(lp508
VI could go on about this at great length, but I won't. (Laughter) (Applause)

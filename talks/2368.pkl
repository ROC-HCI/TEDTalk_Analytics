VI would like to demonstrate for the first time in public
p5
aVthat it is possible to transmit a video
p6
aVfrom a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp
p7
aVto a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver.
p8
aVThere is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd you may wonder, what's the point?
p11
aVAnd the point is this:
p12
aVThere will be a massive extension of the Internet
p13
aVto close the digital divide,
p14
aVand also to allow for what we call "The Internet of Things" \u2014
p15
aVtens of billions of devices connected to the Internet.
p16
aa(lp17
VIn my view, such an extension of the Internet can only work
p18
aVif it's almost energy-neutral.
p19
aVThis means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible.
p20
aVAnd this is where the solar cell and the LED come in.
p21
aa(lp22
VI demonstrated for the first time,
p23
aVat TED in 2011,
p24
aVLi-Fi, or Light Fidelity.
p25
aVLi-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast,
p26
aVand also in a safe and secure manner.
p27
aVData is transported by the light,
p28
aVencoded in subtle changes of the brightness.
p29
aVIf we look around, we have many LEDs around us,
p30
aVso there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi transmitters around us.
p31
aVBut so far, we have been using special devices \u2014 small photo detectors,
p32
aVto receive the information encoded in the data.
p33
aVI wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure
p34
aVto receive data from our Li-Fi lights.
p35
aVAnd this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels.
p36
aa(lp37
VA solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy.
p38
aVThis is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone.
p39
aVBut now we need to remember
p40
aVthat the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED,
p41
aVso if the incoming light fluctuates,
p42
aVso does the energy harvested from the solar cell.
p43
aVThis means we have a principal mechanism in place
p44
aVto receive information from the light and by the solar cell,
p45
aVbecause the fluctuations of the energy harvested
p46
aVcorrespond to the data transmitted.
p47
aa(lp48
VOf course the question is:
p49
aVcan we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness,
p50
aVsuch as the ones transmitted by our LED lights?
p51
aVAnd the answer to that is yes, we can.
p52
aVWe have shown in the lab
p53
aVthat we can receive up to 50 megabytes per second
p54
aVfrom a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.
p55
aVAnd this is faster than most broadband connections these days.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow let me show you in practice.
p58
aVIn this box is a standard, off-the-shelf LED lamp.
p59
aVThis is a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell;
p60
aVit is connected to the laptop.
p61
aVAnd also we have an instrument here
p62
aVto visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell.
p63
aVAnd this instrument shows something at the moment.
p64
aVThis is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow what I would like to do first is switch on the light,
p67
aVand I'll simply, only switch on the light,
p68
aVfor a moment,
p69
aVand what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right.
p70
aVSo the solar cell, for a moment,
p71
aVis harvesting energy from this artificial light source.
p72
aVIf I turn it off, we see it drops.
p73
aVI turn it on ...
p74
aVSo we harvest energy with the solar cell.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut next I would like to activate the streaming of the video.
p77
aVAnd I've done this by pressing this button.
p78
aVSo now this LED lamp here is streaming a video
p79
aVby changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way,
p80
aVand in a way that you can't recognize with your eye,
p81
aVbecause the changes are too fast to recognize.
p82
aVBut in order to prove the point,
p83
aVI can block the light of the solar cell.
p84
aVSo first you notice the energy harvesting drops
p85
aVand the video stops as well.
p86
aVIf I remove the blockage, the video will restart.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Applause)
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd I can repeat that.
p91
aVSo we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well.
p92
aVSo that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog.
p95
aVAnd so I want to simulate fog,
p96
aVand that's why I brought a handkerchief with me.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell.
p101
aVFirst you notice
p102
aVthe energy harvested drops, as expected,
p103
aVbut now the video still continues.
p104
aVThis means, despite the blockage,
p105
aVthere's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell,
p106
aVso that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information,
p107
aVin this case, a high-definition video.
p108
aa(lp109
VWhat's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver
p110
aVfor high-speed wireless signals encoded in light,
p111
aVwhile it maintains its primary function as an energy-harvesting device.
p112
aVThat's why it is possible
p113
aVto use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut
p114
aVto act as a broadband receiver
p115
aVfrom a laser station on a close by hill, or indeed, lamp post.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell.
p118
aVAnd the same is true
p119
aVfor translucent solar cells integrated into windows,
p120
aVsolar cells integrated into street furniture,
p121
aVor indeed, solar cells integrated into these billions of devices
p122
aVthat will form the Internet of Things.
p123
aVBecause simply,
p124
aVwe don't want to charge these devices regularly,
p125
aVor worse, replace the batteries every few months.
p126
aa(lp127
VAs I said to you,
p128
aVthis is the first time I've shown this in public.
p129
aVIt's very much a lab demonstration,
p130
aVa prototype.
p131
aVBut my team and I are confident that we can take this to market
p132
aVwithin the next two to three years.
p133
aVAnd we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide,
p134
aVand also contribute
p135
aVto connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet.
p136
aVAnd all of this without causing
p137
aVa massive explosion of energy consumption \u2014
p138
aVbecause of the solar cells, quite the opposite.
p139
aa(lp140
VThank you.

Harald Haas is working on it. He currently holds the Chair of Mobile Communications at the University of Edinburgh, and is co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of pureLiFi Ltd as well as the Director of the LiFi Research and Development Center at the University of Edinburgh. His main research interests are in optical wireless communications, hybrid optical wireless and RF communications, spatial modulation, and interference coordination in wireless networks.</p><p>Haas has long been studying ways to communicate electronic data signals, designing modulation techniques that pack more data onto existing networks. But his latest work leaps beyond wires and radio waves to transmit data via an LED bulb that glows and darkens faster than the human eye can see. His group published the first proof-of-concept results demonstrating that it is possible to to turn commercially available light emitting diode (LED) light bulbs into broadband wireless transmission systems.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;It should be so cheap that it&#39;s everywhere,&quot; he says. &quot;Using the visible light spectrum, which comes for free, you can piggy-back existing wireless services on the back of lighting equipment.&quot;</p>", "slug": "harald_haas", "whotheyare": "Harald Haas is the pioneer behind a new technology that can communicate as well as illuminate.", "whatotherssay": "As well as revolutionising internet reception, it would put an end to the potentially harmful electromagnetic pollution emitted by wireless internet routers and has raised the prospect of ubiquitous wireless access, transmitted through streetlights.", "id": 1009, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/8c44796c499cb4f124bbe75d55fd428b5dacaf64_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Forget Wi-Fi.

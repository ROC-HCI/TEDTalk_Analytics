VWhat do you think when you look at me?
p5
aVA woman of faith? An expert?
p6
aVMaybe even a sister.
p7
aVOr oppressed,
p8
aVbrainwashed,
p9
aVa terrorist.
p10
aVOr just an airport security line delay.
p11
aVThat one's actually true.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VIf some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you.
p16
aVThat's just how the media has been portraying
p17
aVpeople who look like me.
p18
aVOne study found
p19
aVthat 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.
p20
aVAnd studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim.
p21
aVI guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VWell, for those of you who have never met a Muslim,
p26
aVit's great to meet you.
p27
aVLet me tell you who I am.
p28
aVI'm a mom, a coffee lover \u2014
p29
aVdouble espresso, cream on the side.
p30
aVI'm an introvert.
p31
aVI'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.
p32
aVAnd I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.
p33
aVBut not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way.
p34
aVIt was a choice.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhen I was 17, I decided to come out.
p37
aVNo, not as a gay person like some of my friends,
p38
aVbut as a Muslim,
p39
aVand decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering.
p40
aVMy feminist friends were aghast:
p41
aV"Why are you oppressing yourself?"
p42
aVThe funny thing was,
p43
aVit was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence
p44
aVfrom the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old,
p45
aVto conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty.
p46
aVI didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents.
p47
aVI wrestled with the Quran.
p48
aVI read and reflected and questioned and doubted
p49
aVand, ultimately, believed.
p50
aVMy relationship with God \u2014 it was not love at first sight.
p51
aVIt was a trust and a slow surrender
p52
aVthat deepened with every reading of the Quran.
p53
aVIts rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears.
p54
aVI see myself in it. I feel that God knows me.
p55
aVHave you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you
p56
aVand yet loves you anyway?
p57
aVThat's how it feels.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd so later, I got married,
p60
aVand like all good Egyptians,
p61
aVstarted my career as an engineer.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VI later had a child, after getting married,
p66
aVand I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd then that terrible morning of September, 2001.
p69
aVI think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning.
p70
aVI was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast,
p71
aVand I look up on the screen and see the words "Breaking News."
p72
aVThere was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings,
p73
aVpeople jumping out of buildings.
p74
aVWhat was this?
p75
aVAn accident?
p76
aVA malfunction?
p77
aVMy shock quickly turned to outrage.
p78
aVWho would do this?
p79
aVAnd I switch the channel and I hear,
p80
aa(lp81
V"... Muslim terrorist ...,"
p82
aV"... in the name of Islam ...,"
p83
aV"... Middle-Eastern descent ...,"
p84
aV"... jihad ...,"
p85
aV"... we should bomb Mecca."
p86
aVOh my God.
p87
aa(lp88
VNot only had my country been attacked,
p89
aVbut in a flash,
p90
aVsomebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen
p91
aVto a suspect.
p92
aa(lp93
VThat same day, we had to drive across Middle America
p94
aVto move to a new city to start grad school.
p95
aVAnd I remember sitting in the passenger seat
p96
aVas we drove in silence,
p97
aVcrouched as low as I could go in my seat,
p98
aVfor the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.
p99
aa(lp100
VWe moved into our apartment that night in a new town
p101
aVin what felt like a completely different world.
p102
aVAnd then I was hearing and seeing and reading
p103
aVwarnings from national Muslim organizations
p104
aVsaying things like, "Be alert," "Be aware,"
p105
aV"Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't congregate."
p106
aa(lp107
VI stayed inside all week.
p108
aVAnd then it was Friday that same week,
p109
aVthe day that Muslims congregate for worship.
p110
aVAnd again the warnings were, "Don't go that first Friday,
p111
aVit could be a target."
p112
aVAnd I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage.
p113
aVEmotions were so raw, understandably,
p114
aVand I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims,
p115
aVor people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out
p116
aVand beaten in the street.
p117
aVMosques were actually firebombed.
p118
aVAnd I thought, we should just stay home.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd yet, something didn't feel right.
p121
aVBecause those people who attacked our country
p122
aVattacked our country.
p123
aVI get it that people were angry at the terrorists.
p124
aVGuess what? So was I.
p125
aVAnd so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy.
p126
aVI don't mind questions. I love questions.
p127
aVIt's the accusations that are tough.
p128
aa(lp129
VToday we hear people actually saying things like,
p130
aV"There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims.
p131
aVWhen are we going to get rid of them?"
p132
aVSo, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques.
p133
aVThey talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor
p134
aVin the body of America.
p135
aVAnd the only question is, are we malignant or benign?
p136
aVYou know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether,
p137
aVand a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question.
p140
aVMuslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America,
p141
aVwe're a vital organ.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VThank you.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Applause)
p148
aa(lp149
VMuslims are inventors and teachers,
p150
aVfirst responders and Olympic athletes.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, is closing down mosques going to make America safer?
p153
aVIt might free up some parking spots,
p154
aVbut it will not end terrorism.
p155
aVGoing to a mosque regularly is actually linked
p156
aVto having more tolerant views of people of other faiths
p157
aVand greater civic engagement.
p158
aVAnd as one police chief in the Washington, DC area
p159
aVrecently told me,
p160
aVpeople don't actually get radicalized at mosques.
p161
aVThey get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer.
p162
aVAnd what you find about the radicalization process
p163
aVis it starts online,
p164
aVbut the first thing that happens
p165
aVis the person gets cut off from their community,
p166
aVfrom even their family,
p167
aVso that the extremist group can brainwash them
p168
aVinto believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims,
p169
aVand everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology
p170
aVare sellouts or apostates.
p171
aVSo if we want to prevent radicalization,
p172
aVwe have to keep people going to the mosque.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion.
p175
aVAfter all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran.
p176
aVNow, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being,
p177
aVI think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.
p178
aVBut we would be giving in to their narrative
p179
aVif we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VThank you.
p184
aa(lp185
VISIS has as much to do with Islam
p186
aVas the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Applause)
p189
aa(lp190
VBoth groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book.
p191
aVBut when you look at them, they're not motivated
p192
aVby what they read in their holy book.
p193
aVIt's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture.
p194
aa(lp195
VRecently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback.
p196
aVHe said that a girl came to him
p197
aVbecause she was thinking of going to join ISIS.
p198
aVAnd I was really surprised and asked him,
p199
aVhad she been in contact with a radical religious leader?
p200
aVAnd he said the problem was quite the opposite,
p201
aVthat every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down
p202
aVand said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world,
p203
aVwas just going to get her in trouble.
p204
aVAnd so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger,
p205
aVshe was a prime target to be exploited
p206
aVby extremists promising her a solution.
p207
aVWhat this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community.
p208
aVHe didn't shame her for her rage \u2014 instead, he gave her constructive ways
p209
aVto make real change in the world.
p210
aVWhat she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS.
p211
aa(lp212
VI've told you a little bit
p213
aVabout how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
p214
aVBut how does it impact ordinary Americans?
p215
aVHow does it impact everyone else?
p216
aVHow does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy,
p217
aVthe health of our free thought?
p218
aa(lp219
VWell, one study \u2014 actually, several studies in neuroscience \u2014
p220
aVshow that when we're afraid, at least three things happen.
p221
aVWe become more accepting of authoritarianism,
p222
aVconformity and prejudice.
p223
aVOne study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories
p224
aVthat were negative about Muslims,
p225
aVthey became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries
p226
aVand policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, this isn't just academic.
p229
aVWhen you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked
p230
aVbetween 2001 and 2013,
p231
aVit happened three times,
p232
aVbut it wasn't around terrorist attacks.
p233
aVIt was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles.
p234
aVSo Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism
p235
aVas I would have expected.
p236
aVIt can actually be a tool of public manipulation,
p237
aVeroding the very foundation of a free society,
p238
aVwhich is rational and well-informed citizens.
p239
aVMuslims are like canaries in the coal mine.
p240
aVWe might be the first to feel it,
p241
aVbut the toxic air of fear is harming us all.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Applause)
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd assigning collective guilt
p246
aVisn't just about having to explain yourself all the time.
p247
aVDeah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple
p248
aVliving in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,
p249
aVwhere they both went to school.
p250
aVDeah was an athlete.
p251
aVHe was in dental school, talented, promising ...
p252
aVAnd his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest,
p253
aVmost generous human being she knew.
p254
aVShe was visiting him there and he showed her his resume,
p255
aVand she was amazed.
p256
aVShe said, "When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man?"
p257
aVJust a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife,
p258
aVtheir neighbor,
p259
aVCraig Stephen Hicks,
p260
aVmurdered them,
p261
aVas well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting for the afternoon,
p262
aVin their apartment,
p263
aVexecution style,
p264
aVafter posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page.
p265
aVHe shot Deah eight times.
p266
aVSo bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo, back to my story.
p269
aVWhat happened after 9/11?
p270
aVDid we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home?
p271
aVWell, we talked it over,
p272
aVand it might seem like a small decision, but to us,
p273
aVit was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids:
p274
aVone that would control us by fear
p275
aVor one where we were practicing our religion freely.
p276
aVSo we decided to go to the mosque.
p277
aVAnd we put my son in his car seat,
p278
aVbuckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque.
p279
aVI took him out, I took off my shoes, I walked into the prayer hall
p280
aVand what I saw made me stop.
p281
aVThe place was completely full.
p282
aVAnd then the imam made an announcement,
p283
aVthanking and welcoming our guests,
p284
aVbecause half the congregation
p285
aVwere Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists,
p286
aVpeople of faith and no faith,
p287
aVwho had come not to attack us, but to stand in solidarity with us.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Applause)
p290
aa(lp291
VI just break down at this time.
p292
aVThese people were there because they chose courage and compassion
p293
aVover panic and prejudice.
p294
aa(lp295
VWhat will you choose?
p296
aVWhat will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry?
p297
aVWill you play it safe?
p298
aVOr will you join those who say
p299
aVwe are better than that?
p300
aa(lp301
VThank you.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Applause)
p304
aa(lp305
VThank you so much.
p306
aa(lp307
VHelen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord.
p308
aVBut I wonder,
p309
aVwhat would you say to those who might argue
p310
aVthat you're giving a TED Talk,
p311
aVyou're clearly a deep thinker,
p312
aVyou work at a fancy think tank,
p313
aVyou're an exception, you're not the rule.
p314
aVWhat would you say to those people?
p315
aa(lp316
VDalia Mogahed: I would say, don't let this stage distract you,
p317
aVI'm completely ordinary.
p318
aVI'm not an exception.
p319
aVMy story is not unusual.
p320
aVI am as ordinary as they come.
p321
aVWhen you look at Muslims around the world \u2014
p322
aVand I've done this, I've done the largest study ever done
p323
aVon Muslims around the world \u2014
p324
aVpeople want ordinary things.
p325
aVThey want prosperity for their family,
p326
aVthey want jobs
p327
aVand they want to live in peace.
p328
aVSo I am not in any way an exception.
p329
aVWhen you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule,
p330
aVoftentimes it's that the rule is broken,
p331
aVnot that they're an exception to it.
p332
aa(lp333
VHW: Thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed.

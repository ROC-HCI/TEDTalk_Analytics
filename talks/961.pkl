VJust a few minutes ago, I took this picture
p5
aVabout 10 blocks from here.
p6
aVThis is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford.
p7
aVI took this picture because this turns out to be
p8
aVthe first coffeehouse to open
p9
aVin England in 1650.
p10
aVThat's its great claim to fame,
p11
aVand I wanted to show it to you,
p12
aVnot because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour
p13
aVof historic England,
p14
aVbut rather because
p15
aVthe English coffeehouse was crucial
p16
aVto the development and spread
p17
aVof one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years,
p18
aVwhat we now call the Enlightenment.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd the coffeehouse played such a big role
p21
aVin the birth of the Enlightenment,
p22
aVin part, because of what people were drinking there.
p23
aVBecause, before the spread
p24
aVof coffee and tea through British culture,
p25
aVwhat people drank \u2014 both elite and mass folks drank \u2014
p26
aVday-in and day-out, from dawn until dusk
p27
aVwas alcohol.
p28
aVAlcohol was the daytime beverage of choice.
p29
aVYou would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch,
p30
aVa little gin \u2014 particularly around 1650 \u2014
p31
aVand top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day.
p32
aVThat was the healthy choice \u2014 right \u2014
p33
aVbecause the water wasn't safe to drink.
p34
aVAnd so, effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse,
p35
aVyou had an entire population
p36
aVthat was effectively drunk all day.
p37
aVAnd you can imagine what that would be like, right, in your own life \u2014
p38
aVand I know this is true of some of you \u2014
p39
aVif you were drinking all day,
p40
aVand then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life,
p41
aVyou would have better ideas.
p42
aVYou would be sharper and more alert.
p43
aVAnd so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened
p44
aVas England switched to tea and coffee.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important
p47
aVis the architecture of the space.
p48
aVIt was a space where people would get together
p49
aVfrom different backgrounds,
p50
aVdifferent fields of expertise, and share.
p51
aVIt was a space, as Matt Ridley talked about, where ideas could have sex.
p52
aVThis was their conjugal bed, in a sense \u2014
p53
aVideas would get together there.
p54
aVAnd an astonishing number of innovations from this period
p55
aVhave a coffeehouse somewhere in their story.
p56
aa(lp57
VI've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses
p58
aVfor the last five years,
p59
aVbecause I've been kind of on this quest
p60
aVto investigate this question
p61
aVof where good ideas come from.
p62
aVWhat are the environments
p63
aVthat lead to unusual levels of innovation,
p64
aVunusual levels of creativity?
p65
aVWhat's the kind of environmental \u2014
p66
aVwhat is the space of creativity?
p67
aVAnd what I've done is
p68
aVI've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse;
p69
aVI've looked at media environments, like the world wide web,
p70
aVthat have been extraordinarily innovative;
p71
aVI've gone back to the history of the first cities;
p72
aVI've even gone to biological environments,
p73
aVlike coral reefs and rainforests,
p74
aVthat involve unusual levels of biological innovation;
p75
aVand what I've been looking for is shared patterns,
p76
aVkind of signature behavior that shows up
p77
aVagain and again in all of these environments.
p78
aVAre there recurring patterns that we can learn from,
p79
aVthat we can take and kind of apply to our own lives,
p80
aVor our own organizations,
p81
aVor our own environments to make them more creative and innovative?
p82
aVAnd I think I've found a few.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut what you have to do to make sense of this
p85
aVand to really understand these principles
p86
aVis you have to do away
p87
aVwith a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language
p88
aVsteers us towards
p89
aVcertain concepts of idea-creation.
p90
aVWe have this very rich vocabulary
p91
aVto describe moments of inspiration.
p92
aVWe have the kind of the flash of insight,
p93
aVthe stroke of insight,
p94
aVwe have epiphanies, we have "eureka!" moments,
p95
aVwe have the lightbulb moments, right?
p96
aVAll of these concepts,
p97
aVas kind of rhetorically florid as they are,
p98
aVshare this basic assumption,
p99
aVwhich is that an idea is a single thing,
p100
aVit's something that happens often
p101
aVin a wonderful illuminating moment.
p102
aa(lp103
VBut in fact, what I would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with
p104
aVis this idea that an idea is a network
p105
aVon the most elemental level.
p106
aVI mean, this is what is happening inside your brain.
p107
aVAn idea \u2014 a new idea \u2014 is a new network of neurons
p108
aVfiring in sync with each other inside your brain.
p109
aVIt's a new configuration that has never formed before.
p110
aVAnd the question is: how do you get your brain into environments
p111
aVwhere these new networks are going to be more likely to form?
p112
aVAnd it turns out that, in fact, the kind of network patterns of the outside world
p113
aVmimic a lot of the network patterns
p114
aVof the internal world of the human brain.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo the metaphor I'd like the use
p117
aVI can take
p118
aVfrom a story of a great idea that's quite recent \u2014
p119
aVa lot more recent than the 1650s.
p120
aVA wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero,
p121
aVwho has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters.
p122
aVThey decided to tackle this really pressing problem
p123
aVof, you know, the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates
p124
aVin the developing world.
p125
aVOne of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know,
p126
aVby getting modern neonatal incubators
p127
aVinto any context,
p128
aVif we can keep premature babies warm, basically \u2014 it's very simple \u2014
p129
aVwe can halve infant mortality rates in those environments.
p130
aVSo, the technology is there.
p131
aVThese are standard in all the industrialized worlds.
p132
aVThe problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator,
p133
aVand you send it off
p134
aVto a mid-sized village in Africa,
p135
aVit will work great for a year or two years,
p136
aVand then something will go wrong and it will break,
p137
aVand it will remain broken forever,
p138
aVbecause you don't have a whole system of spare parts,
p139
aVand you don't have the on-the-ground expertise
p140
aVto fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.
p141
aVAnd so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money
p142
aVgetting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries,
p143
aVand then it ends up being useless.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo what Prestero and his team decided to do
p146
aVis to look around and see: what are the abundant resources
p147
aVin these developing world contexts?
p148
aVAnd what they noticed was they don't have a lot of DVRs,
p149
aVthey don't have a lot of microwaves,
p150
aVbut they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road.
p151
aVThere's a Toyota Forerunner
p152
aVon the street in all these places.
p153
aVThey seem to have the expertise to keep cars working.
p154
aVSo they started to think,
p155
aV"Could we build a neonatal incubator
p156
aVthat's built entirely out of automobile parts?"
p157
aVAnd this is what they ended up coming with.
p158
aVIt's called a "neonurture device."
p159
aVFrom the outside, it looks like a normal little thing
p160
aVyou'd find in a modern, Western hospital.
p161
aVIn the inside, it's all car parts.
p162
aVIt's got a fan, it's got headlights for warmth,
p163
aVit's got door chimes for alarm \u2014
p164
aVit runs off a car battery.
p165
aVAnd so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota
p166
aVand the ability to fix a headlight,
p167
aVand you can repair this thing.
p168
aVNow, that's a great idea, but what I'd like to say is that, in fact,
p169
aVthis is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen.
p170
aVWe like to think our breakthrough ideas, you know,
p171
aVare like that $40,000, brand new incubator,
p172
aVstate-of-the-art technology,
p173
aVbut more often than not, they're cobbled together
p174
aVfrom whatever parts that happen to be around nearby.
p175
aa(lp176
VWe take ideas from other people,
p177
aVfrom people we've learned from, from people we run into in the coffee shop,
p178
aVand we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new.
p179
aVThat's really where innovation happens.
p180
aVAnd that means that we have to change some of our models
p181
aVof what innovation and deep thinking really looks like, right.
p182
aVI mean, this is one vision of it.
p183
aVAnother is Newton and the apple, when Newton was at Cambridge.
p184
aVThis is a statue from Oxford.
p185
aVYou know, you're sitting there thinking a deep thought,
p186
aVand the apple falls from the tree, and you have the theory of gravity.
p187
aVIn fact, the spaces that have historically led to innovation
p188
aVtend to look like this, right.
p189
aVThis is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern,
p190
aVbut this is what the coffee shops looked like back then.
p191
aVThis is the kind of chaotic environment
p192
aVwhere ideas were likely to come together,
p193
aVwhere people were likely to have
p194
aVnew, interesting, unpredictable collisions \u2014 people from different backgrounds.
p195
aVSo, if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative,
p196
aVwe have to build spaces that \u2014 strangely enough \u2014 look a little bit more like this.
p197
aVThis is what your office should look like,
p198
aVis part of my message here.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd one of the problems with this is that
p201
aVpeople are actually \u2014 when you research this field \u2014
p202
aVpeople are notoriously unreliable,
p203
aVwhen they actually kind of self-report
p204
aVon where they have their own good ideas,
p205
aVor their history of their best ideas.
p206
aVAnd a few years ago, a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar
p207
aVdecided to go around
p208
aVand basically do the Big Brother approach
p209
aVto figuring out where good ideas come from.
p210
aVHe went to a bunch of science labs around the world
p211
aVand videotaped everyone
p212
aVas they were doing every little bit of their job.
p213
aVSo when they were sitting in front of the microscope,
p214
aVwhen they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler, and all these things.
p215
aVAnd he recorded all of these conversations
p216
aVand tried to figure out where the most important ideas,
p217
aVwhere they happened.
p218
aVAnd when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab,
p219
aVwe have this image \u2014 you know, they're pouring over the microscope,
p220
aVand they see something in the tissue sample.
p221
aVAnd "oh, eureka," they've got the idea.
p222
aa(lp223
VWhat happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape
p224
aVis that, in fact, almost all of the important breakthrough ideas
p225
aVdid not happen alone in the lab, in front of the microscope.
p226
aVThey happened at the conference table
p227
aVat the weekly lab meeting,
p228
aVwhen everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings,
p229
aVoftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having,
p230
aVthe error, the noise in the signal they were discovering.
p231
aVAnd something about that environment \u2014
p232
aVand I've started calling it the "liquid network,"
p233
aVwhere you have lots of different ideas that are together,
p234
aVdifferent backgrounds, different interests,
p235
aVjostling with each other, bouncing off each other \u2014
p236
aVthat environment is, in fact,
p237
aVthe environment that leads to innovation.
p238
aa(lp239
VThe other problem that people have
p240
aVis they like to condense their stories of innovation down
p241
aVto kind of shorter time frames.
p242
aVSo they want to tell the story of the "eureka!" moment.
p243
aVThey want to say, "There I was, I was standing there
p244
aVand I had it all suddenly clear in my head."
p245
aVBut in fact, if you go back and look at the historical record,
p246
aVit turns out that a lot of important ideas
p247
aVhave very long incubation periods \u2014
p248
aVI call this the "slow hunch."
p249
aVWe've heard a lot recently
p250
aVabout hunch and instinct
p251
aVand blink-like sudden moments of clarity,
p252
aVbut in fact, a lot of great ideas
p253
aVlinger on, sometimes for decades,
p254
aVin the back of people's minds.
p255
aVThey have a feeling that there's an interesting problem,
p256
aVbut they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them.
p257
aVThey spend all this time working on certain problems,
p258
aVbut there's another thing lingering there
p259
aVthat they're interested in, but they can't quite solve.
p260
aa(lp261
VDarwin is a great example of this.
p262
aVDarwin himself, in his autobiography,
p263
aVtells the story of coming up with the idea
p264
aVfor natural selection
p265
aVas a classic "eureka!" moment.
p266
aVHe's in his study,
p267
aVit's October of 1838,
p268
aVand he's reading Malthus, actually, on population.
p269
aVAnd all of a sudden,
p270
aVthe basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head
p271
aVand he says, "Ah, at last, I had a theory with which to work."
p272
aVThat's in his autobiography.
p273
aVAbout a decade or two ago,
p274
aVa wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back
p275
aVand looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period.
p276
aVAnd Darwin kept these copious notebooks
p277
aVwhere he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch.
p278
aVAnd what Gruber found was
p279
aVthat Darwin had the full theory of natural selection
p280
aVfor months and months and months
p281
aVbefore he had his alleged epiphany,
p282
aVreading Malthus in October of 1838.
p283
aVThere are passages where you can read it,
p284
aVand you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook,
p285
aVfrom the period before he has this epiphany.
p286
aVAnd so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense,
p287
aVhad the idea, he had the concept,
p288
aVbut was unable of fully thinking it yet.
p289
aVAnd that is actually how great ideas often happen;
p290
aVthey fade into view over long periods of time.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow the challenge for all of us is:
p293
aVhow do you create environments
p294
aVthat allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life, right?
p295
aVIt's hard to go to your boss and say,
p296
aV"I have an excellent idea for our organization.
p297
aVIt will be useful in 2020.
p298
aVCould you just give me some time to do that?"
p299
aVNow a couple of companies \u2014 like Google \u2014
p300
aVthey have innovation time off, 20 percent time,
p301
aVwhere, in a sense, those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization.
p302
aVBut that's a key thing.
p303
aVAnd the other thing is to allow those hunches
p304
aVto connect with other people's hunches; that's what often happens.
p305
aVYou have half of an idea, somebody else has the other half,
p306
aVand if you're in the right environment,
p307
aVthey turn into something larger than the sum of their parts.
p308
aVSo, in a sense,
p309
aVwe often talk about the value
p310
aVof protecting intellectual property,
p311
aVyou know, building barricades,
p312
aVhaving secretive R&D labs, patenting everything that we have,
p313
aVso that those ideas will remain valuable,
p314
aVand people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas,
p315
aVand the culture will be more innovative.
p316
aVBut I think there's a case to be made
p317
aVthat we should spend at least as much time, if not more,
p318
aVvaluing the premise of connecting ideas
p319
aVand not just protecting them.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd I'll leave you with this story,
p322
aVwhich I think captures a lot of these values,
p323
aVand it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation
p324
aVand how it happens in unlikely ways.
p325
aVIt's October of 1957,
p326
aVand Sputnik has just launched,
p327
aVand we're in Laurel Maryland,
p328
aVat the applied physics lab
p329
aVassociated with Johns Hopkins University.
p330
aVAnd it's Monday morning,
p331
aVand the news has just broken about this satellite
p332
aVthat's now orbiting the planet.
p333
aVAnd of course, this is nerd heaven, right?
p334
aVThere are all these physics geeks who are there thinking,
p335
aV"Oh my gosh! This is incredible. I can't believe this has happened."
p336
aVAnd two of them,
p337
aVtwo 20-something researchers at the APL
p338
aVare there at the cafeteria table
p339
aVhaving an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues.
p340
aVAnd these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach.
p341
aVAnd they start talking, and one of them says,
p342
aV"Hey, has anybody tried to listen for this thing?
p343
aVThere's this, you know, man-made satellite up there in outer space
p344
aVthat's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal.
p345
aVWe could probably hear it, if we tune in."
p346
aVAnd so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues,
p347
aVand everybody's like, "No, I hadn't thought of doing that.
p348
aVThat's an interesting idea."
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert
p351
aVin microwave reception,
p352
aVand he's got a little antennae set up
p353
aVwith an amplifier in his office.
p354
aVAnd so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office,
p355
aVand they start kind of noodling around \u2014 hacking, as we might call it now.
p356
aVAnd after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up the signal,
p357
aVbecause the Soviets made Sputnik
p358
aVvery easy to track.
p359
aVIt was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily,
p360
aVbecause they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically.
p361
aVSo they made it really easy to find it.
p362
aa(lp363
VSo these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal,
p364
aVand people start kind of coming into the office and saying,
p365
aV"Wow, that's pretty cool. Can I hear? Wow, that's great."
p366
aVAnd before long, they think, "Well jeez, this is kind of historic.
p367
aVWe may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this.
p368
aVWe should record it."
p369
aVAnd so they bring in this big, clunky analog tape recorder
p370
aVand they start recording these little bleep, bleeps.
p371
aVAnd they start writing the kind of date stamp, time stamps
p372
aVfor each little bleep that they record.
p373
aVAnd they they start thinking, "Well gosh, you know, we're noticing
p374
aVsmall little frequency variations here.
p375
aVWe could probably calculate the speed
p376
aVthat the satellite is traveling,
p377
aVif we do a little basic math here
p378
aVusing the Doppler effect."
p379
aVAnd then they played around with it a little bit more,
p380
aVand they talked to a couple of their colleagues
p381
aVwho had other kind of specialties.
p382
aVAnd they said, "Jeez, you know,
p383
aVwe think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect
p384
aVto figure out the points at which
p385
aVthe satellite is closest to our antennae
p386
aVand the points at which it's farthest away.
p387
aVThat's pretty cool."
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd eventually, they get permission \u2014
p390
aVthis is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description.
p391
aVThey get permission to use the new, you know, UNIVAC computer
p392
aVthat takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL.
p393
aVThey run some more of the numbers, and at the end of about three or four weeks,
p394
aVturns out they have mapped the exact trajectory
p395
aVof this satellite around the Earth,
p396
aVjust from listening to this one little signal,
p397
aVgoing off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do
p398
aVover lunch one morning.
p399
aa(lp400
VA couple weeks later their boss, Frank McClure,
p401
aVpulls them into the room and says,
p402
aV"Hey, you guys, I have to ask you something
p403
aVabout that project you were working on.
p404
aVYou've figured out an unknown location
p405
aVof a satellite orbiting the planet
p406
aVfrom a known location on the ground.
p407
aVCould you go the other way?
p408
aVCould you figure out an unknown location on the ground,
p409
aVif you knew the location of the satellite?"
p410
aVAnd they thought about it and they said,
p411
aV"Well, I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here."
p412
aVSo they went back, and they thought about it.
p413
aVAnd they came back and said, "Actually, it'll be easier."
p414
aVAnd he said, "Oh, that's great.
p415
aVBecause see, I have these new nuclear submarines
p416
aVthat I'm building.
p417
aVAnd it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile
p418
aVso that it will land right on top of Moscow,
p419
aVif you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
p420
aVSo we're thinking, we could throw up a bunch of satellites
p421
aVand use it to track our submarines
p422
aVand figure out their location in the middle of the ocean.
p423
aVCould you work on that problem?"
p424
aa(lp425
VAnd that's how GPS was born.

VThe following are my opinions,
p5
aVand do not reflect the opinions or policies
p6
aVof any particular prosecutor's office.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VI am a prosecutor.
p11
aVI believe in law and order.
p12
aVI am the adopted son of a police officer, a Marine and a hairdresser.
p13
aVI believe in accountability
p14
aVand that we should all be safe in our communities.
p15
aVI love my job
p16
aVand the people that do it.
p17
aVI just think that it's our responsibility
p18
aVto do it better.
p19
aa(lp20
VBy a show of hands,
p21
aVhow many of you, by the age of 25,
p22
aVhad either acted up in school,
p23
aVwent somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of,
p24
aVor drank alcohol before your legal age?
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VAll right.
p29
aa(lp30
VHow many of you shoplifted,
p31
aVtried an illegal drug
p32
aVor got into a physical fight \u2014
p33
aVyes, even with a sibling?
p34
aVNow, how many of you ever spent one day in jail
p35
aVfor any of those decisions?
p36
aVHow many of you sitting here today
p37
aVthink that you're a danger to society
p38
aVor should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion?
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VPoint taken.
p43
aa(lp44
VWhen we talk about criminal justice reform,
p45
aVwe often focus on a few things,
p46
aVand that's what I want to talk to you about today.
p47
aVBut first I'm going to \u2014 since you shared with me,
p48
aVI'm going to give you a confession on my part.
p49
aVI went to law school
p50
aVto make money.
p51
aVI had no interest in being a public servant,
p52
aVI had no interest in criminal law,
p53
aVand I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor.
p54
aa(lp55
VNear the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship
p56
aVin the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court.
p57
aVI knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston,
p58
aVplagued by gun violence and drug crime.
p59
aVMy life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship.
p60
aVI walked into a courtroom, and I saw an auditorium of people
p61
aVwho, one by one, would approach the front of that courtroom
p62
aVto say two words and two words only:
p63
aV"Not guilty."
p64
aVThey were predominately black and brown.
p65
aVAnd then a judge, a defense attorney and a prosecutor
p66
aVwould make life-altering decisions about that person without their input.
p67
aVThey were predominately white.
p68
aVAs each person, one by one, approached the front of that courtroom,
p69
aVI couldn't stop but think:
p70
aVHow did they get here?
p71
aVI wanted to know their stories.
p72
aVAnd as the prosecutor read the facts of each case,
p73
aVI was thinking to myself,
p74
aVwe could have predicted that.
p75
aVThat seems so preventable...
p76
aVnot because I was an expert in criminal law,
p77
aVbut because it was common sense.
p78
aa(lp79
VOver the course of the internship,
p80
aVI began to recognize people in the auditorium,
p81
aVnot because they were criminal masterminds
p82
aVbut because they were coming to us for help
p83
aVand we were sending them out without any.
p84
aa(lp85
VMy second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney,
p86
aVand in that experience I met many young men accused of murder.
p87
aVEven in our "worst," I saw human stories.
p88
aVAnd they all contained childhood trauma,
p89
aVvictimization, poverty, loss,
p90
aVdisengagement from school,
p91
aVearly interaction with the police and the criminal justice system,
p92
aVall leading to a seat in a courtroom.
p93
aVThose convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison,
p94
aVand it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom
p95
aVwhy we would spend so much money
p96
aVto keep this one person in jail for the next 80 years
p97
aVwhen we could have reinvested it up front,
p98
aVand perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Applause)
p101
aa(lp102
VMy third year of law school,
p103
aVI defended people accused of small street crimes,
p104
aVmostly mentally ill,
p105
aVmostly homeless,
p106
aVmostly drug-addicted,
p107
aVall in need of help.
p108
aVThey would come to us,
p109
aVand we would send them away without that help.
p110
aVThey were in need of our assistance.
p111
aVBut we weren't giving them any.
p112
aVProsecuted, adjudged and defended
p113
aVby people who knew nothing about them.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work.
p116
aVThe unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender.
p117
aVThe power dynamic that I came to understand
p118
aVmade me become a prosecutor.
p119
aa(lp120
VI don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem.
p121
aVWe know the criminal justice system needs reform,
p122
aVwe know there are 2.3 million people in American jails and prisons,
p123
aVmaking us the most incarcerated nation on the planet.
p124
aVWe know there's another seven million people on probation or parole,
p125
aVwe know that the criminal justice system
p126
aVdisproportionately affects people of color,
p127
aVparticularly poor people of color.
p128
aVAnd we know there are system failures happening everywhere
p129
aVthat bring people to our courtrooms.
p130
aVBut what we do not discuss
p131
aVis how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them.
p132
aVWhen we talk about criminal justice reform,
p133
aVwe, as a society, focus on three things.
p134
aVWe complain, we tweet, we protest
p135
aVabout the police, about sentencing laws
p136
aVand about prison.
p137
aVWe rarely, if ever, talk about the prosecutor.
p138
aa(lp139
VIn the fall of 2009,
p140
aVa young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department.
p141
aVHe was 18 years old, he was African American
p142
aVand he was a senior at a local public school.
p143
aVHe had his sights set on college
p144
aVbut his part-time, minimum-wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity
p145
aVhe needed to enroll in school.
p146
aVIn a series of bad decisions,
p147
aVhe stole 30 laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet.
p148
aVThis led to his arrest
p149
aVand a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges.
p150
aVThe potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most.
p151
aVBut what he had little understanding of
p152
aVwas the impact a criminal record would have on his future.
p153
aa(lp154
VI was standing in arraignments that day
p155
aVwhen Christopher's case came across my desk.
p156
aVAnd at the risk of sounding dramatic, in that moment,
p157
aVI had Christopher's life in my hands.
p158
aVI was 29 years old, a brand-new prosecutor,
p159
aVand I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make
p160
aVwould impact Christopher's life.
p161
aVChristopher's case was a serious one
p162
aVand it needed to be dealt with as such,
p163
aVbut I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life
p164
aVwas the right answer.
p165
aa(lp166
VFor the most part, prosecutors step onto the job
p167
aVwith little appreciation of the impact of our decisions,
p168
aVregardless of our intent.
p169
aVDespite our broad discretion,
p170
aVwe learn to avoid risk at all cost,
p171
aVrendering our discretion
p172
aVbasically useless.
p173
aVHistory has conditioned us to believe that somehow,
p174
aVthe criminal justice system brings about accountability
p175
aVand improves public safety,
p176
aVdespite evidence to the contrary.
p177
aVWe're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins,
p178
aVso prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative
p179
aVat our case dispositions,
p180
aVor to take risks on people we might not otherwise.
p181
aVWe stick to an outdated method,
p182
aVcounterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want,
p183
aVand that's safer communities.
p184
aa(lp185
VYet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher.
p186
aVThey have little appreciation for what we can do.
p187
aVArraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record,
p188
aVmaking it harder for him to get a job,
p189
aVsetting in motion a cycle
p190
aVthat defines the failing criminal justice system today.
p191
aVWith a criminal record and without a job,
p192
aVChristopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing.
p193
aVWithout those protective factors in his life,
p194
aVChristopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime.
p195
aVThe more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system,
p196
aVthe more likely it would be that he would return again
p197
aVand again and again \u2014
p198
aVall at tremendous social cost to his children, to his family
p199
aVand to his peers.
p200
aVAnd, ladies and gentlemen,
p201
aVit is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us.
p202
aa(lp203
VWhen I came out of law school,
p204
aVI did the same thing as everybody else.
p205
aVI came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice,
p206
aVbut I never learned what justice was in my classes \u2014
p207
aVnone of us do.
p208
aVNone of us do.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd yet, prosecutors are the most powerful actors
p211
aVin the criminal justice system.
p212
aVOur power is virtually boundless.
p213
aVIn most cases, not the judge,
p214
aVnot the police, not the legislature,
p215
aVnot the mayor, not the governor, not the President
p216
aVcan tell us how to prosecute our cases.
p217
aVThe decision to arraign Christopher and give him a criminal record
p218
aVwas exclusively mine.
p219
aVI would choose whether to prosecute him for 30 felonies, for one felony,
p220
aVfor a misdemeanor,
p221
aVor at all.
p222
aVI would choose whether to leverage Christopher into a plea deal
p223
aVor take the case to trial, and ultimately,
p224
aVI would be in a position to ask for Christopher to go to jail.
p225
aVThese are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered,
p226
aVand we are unaware and untrained
p227
aVof the grave consequences of those decisions.
p228
aa(lp229
VOne night this past summer,
p230
aVI was at a small gathering of professional men of color
p231
aVfrom around the city.
p232
aVAs I stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth,
p233
aVas you do as public servant \u2014
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VI noticed across the room,
p238
aVa young man waving and smiling at me and approaching me.
p239
aVAnd I recognized him, but I couldn't place from where,
p240
aVand before I knew it, this young man was hugging me.
p241
aVAnd thanking me.
p242
aV"You cared about me, and you changed my life."
p243
aVIt was Christopher.
p244
aa(lp245
VSee, I never arraigned Christopher.
p246
aVHe never faced a judge or a jail,
p247
aVhe never had a criminal record.
p248
aVInstead, I worked with Christopher;
p249
aVfirst on being accountable for his actions,
p250
aVand then, putting him in a position where he wouldn't re-offend.
p251
aVWe recovered 75 percent of the computers that he sold
p252
aVand gave them back to Best Buy,
p253
aVand came up with a financial plan
p254
aVto repay for the computers we couldn't recover.
p255
aVChristopher did community service.
p256
aVHe wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future
p257
aVand that of the community.
p258
aVHe applied to college,
p259
aVhe obtained financial aid,
p260
aVand he went on to graduate from a four-year school.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Applause)
p263
aa(lp264
VAfter we finished hugging, I looked at his name tag,
p265
aVto learn that Christopher was the manager of a large bank in Boston.
p266
aVChristopher had accomplished \u2014 and making a lot more money than me \u2014
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VHe had accomplished all of this
p271
aVin the six years since I had first seen him in Roxbury Court.
p272
aVI can't take credit for Christopher's journey to success,
p273
aVbut I certainly did my part to keep him on the path.
p274
aa(lp275
VThere are thousands of Christophers out there,
p276
aVsome locked in our jails and prisons.
p277
aVWe need thousands of prosecutors
p278
aVto recognize that and to protect them.
p279
aVAn employed Christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one.
p280
aVIt's a bigger win for all of us.
p281
aVIn retrospect, the decision not to throw the book at Christopher
p282
aVmakes perfect sense.
p283
aVWhen I saw him that first day in Roxbury Court,
p284
aVI didn't see a criminal standing there.
p285
aVI saw myself \u2014 a young person in need of intervention.
p286
aVAs an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens,
p287
aVI knew firsthand the power of opportunity
p288
aVas opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system.
p289
aVAlong the way, with the help and guidance of my district attorney,
p290
aVmy supervisor and judges,
p291
aVI learned the power of the prosecutor
p292
aVto change lives instead of ruining them.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd that's how we do it in Boston.
p295
aVWe helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids
p296
aVget a job.
p297
aVInstead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail
p298
aVfor punching another teenager,
p299
aVwe secured mental health treatment and community supervision.
p300
aVA runaway girl who was arrested
p301
aVfor prostituting, to survive on the streets,
p302
aVneeded a safe place to live and grow \u2014
p303
aVsomething we could help her with.
p304
aVI even helped a young man
p305
aVwho was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school,
p306
aVthat one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack,
p307
aVhe put a loaded 9-millimeter.
p308
aVWe would spend our time that we'd normally take prepping our cases
p309
aVfor months and months for trial down the road
p310
aVby coming up with real solutions to the problems as they presented.
p311
aa(lp312
VWhich is the better way to spend our time?
p313
aVHow would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs?
p314
aVWhy are we spending 80 billion dollars
p315
aVon a prison industry that we know is failing,
p316
aVwhen we could take that money and reallocate it into education,
p317
aVinto mental health treatment,
p318
aVinto substance abuse treatment
p319
aVand to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods?
p320
aa(lp321
V(Applause)
p322
aa(lp323
VSo why should this matter to you?
p324
aVWell, one, we're spending a lot of money.
p325
aVOur money.
p326
aVIt costs 109,000 dollars in some states
p327
aVto lock up a teenager for a year,
p328
aVwith a 60 percent chance that that person will return to the very same system.
p329
aVThat is a terrible return on investment.
p330
aa(lp331
VNumber two: it's the right thing to do.
p332
aVIf prosecutors were a part of creating the problem,
p333
aVit's incumbent on us to create a solution
p334
aVand we can do that using other disciplines
p335
aVthat have already done the data and research for us.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd number three:
p338
aVyour voice and your vote can make that happen.
p339
aVThe next time there's a local district attorney's election
p340
aVin your jurisdiction,
p341
aVask candidates these questions.
p342
aVOne: What are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer?
p343
aVTwo: What data are you collecting,
p344
aVand how are you training your prosecutors
p345
aVto make sure that it's working?
p346
aVAnd number three:
p347
aVIf it's not working for everybody,
p348
aVwhat are you doing to fix it?
p349
aVIf they can't answer the questions,
p350
aVthey shouldn't be doing the job.
p351
aa(lp352
VEach one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk
p353
aVis a living, breathing example of the power of opportunity,
p354
aVof intervention,
p355
aVof support
p356
aVand of love.
p357
aVWhile each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline
p358
aVfor whatever malfeasances you committed,
p359
aVbarely any of you needed a day in jail
p360
aVto make you the people that you are today \u2014
p361
aVsome of the greatest minds on the planet.
p362
aa(lp363
VEvery day, thousands of times a day,
p364
aVprosecutors around the United States wield power so great
p365
aVthat it can bring about catastrophe
p366
aVas quickly as it can bring about opportunity,
p367
aVintervention,
p368
aVsupport
p369
aVand yes, even love.
p370
aVThose qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community,
p371
aVand a strong community is a safe one.
p372
aVIf our communities are broken,
p373
aVdon't let the lawyers that you elect fix them
p374
aVwith outdated, inefficient, expensive methods.
p375
aa(lp376
VDemand more; vote for the prosecutor who's helping people stay out of jail,
p377
aVnot putting them in.
p378
aa(lp379
VDemand better.
p380
aVYou deserve it, your children deserve it,
p381
aVthe people who are tied up in the system deserve it,
p382
aVbut most of all,
p383
aVthe people that we are sworn to protect and do justice for demand it.
p384
aa(lp385
VWe must,
p386
aVwe must do better.
p387
aa(lp388
VThank you.
p389
aa(lp390
V(Applause)
p391
aa(lp392
VThank you.
p393
aa(lp394
V(Applause)
p395
aa(lp396
VThank you very much.

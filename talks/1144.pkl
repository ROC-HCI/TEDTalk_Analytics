VMy name is Amit.
p5
aVAnd 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,
p6
aVand I pitched this idea
p7
aVof doing something with museums and art
p8
aVto my boss who's actually here,
p9
aVand she allowed me to do it.
p10
aVAnd it took 18 months.
p11
aVA lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,
p12
aVwith 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
p13
aVBut I'm going to focus on the demo.
p14
aVThere are a lot of stories about why we did this.
p15
aa(lp16
VI think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,
p17
aVand it's access.
p18
aVAnd I grew up in India.
p19
aVI had a great education \u2014 I'm not complaining \u2014
p20
aVbut I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.
p21
aVAnd so when I started traveling and going to these museums,
p22
aVI started learning a lot.
p23
aVAnd while working at Google,
p24
aVI tried to put this desire
p25
aVto make it more accessible with technology together.
p26
aVSo we formed a team, a great team of people,
p27
aVand we started doing this.
p28
aa(lp29
VI'm going to probably get into the demo
p30
aVand then tell you a couple of the interesting things
p31
aVwe've had since launch.
p32
aVSo, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
p33
aVYou look around at all these museums here.
p34
aVYou've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA,
p35
aVthe Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.
p36
aVI'm going to actually get to one of my favorites,
p37
aVthe Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
p38
aVTwo ways of going in \u2014 very simple.
p39
aVClick and, bang, you're in this museum.
p40
aVIt doesn't matter where you are \u2014
p41
aVBombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.
p42
aVYou move around, you have fun.
p43
aVYou want to navigate around the museum?
p44
aVOpen the plan up,
p45
aVand, in one click, jump.
p46
aVYou're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.
p47
aVKeep going. Have fun.
p48
aVExplore.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Applause)
p51
aa(lp52
VThanks. I haven't come to the best part.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VSo now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,
p57
aV"The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.
p58
aVI see this plus sign.
p59
aVIf the museum has given us the image, you click on it.
p60
aVNow this is one of the images.
p61
aVSo this is all of the meta-data information.
p62
aVFor those of you who are truly interested in art,
p63
aVyou can click this \u2014 but I'm going to click this off right now.
p64
aVAnd this is one of these images that we captured
p65
aVin what we call gigapixel technology.
p66
aVSo this image, for example,
p67
aVhas close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.
p68
aVAnd I get a lot of people asking me:
p69
aV"What do you get for 10 billion pixels?"
p70
aVSo I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.
p71
aVYou can zoom around very simply.
p72
aVYou see some fun stuff happening here.
p73
aVI love this guy; his expression is priceless.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut then you really want to go deep.
p76
aVAnd so I started playing around,
p77
aVand I found something going on over here.
p78
aVAnd I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting."
p79
aVWent in, and I started noticing
p80
aVthat these kids were actually beating something.
p81
aVI did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met,
p82
aVand actually found out that this is a game
p83
aVcalled squall,
p84
aVwhich involves beating a goose with a stick
p85
aVon Shrove Tuesday.
p86
aVAnd apparently it was quite popular.
p87
aVI don't know why they did it,
p88
aVbut I learned something about it.
p89
aVNow just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.
p90
aVNow just to give you some perspective,
p91
aVI'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.
p92
aVHere is where we were,
p93
aVand this is the painting.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Applause)
p96
aa(lp97
VThe best is yet to come \u2014 so in a second.
p98
aVSo now let's just quickly
p99
aVjump into the MoMA, again in New York.
p100
aVSo another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night."
p101
aVNow the example I showed you was all about finding details.
p102
aVBut what if you want to see brush strokes?
p103
aVAnd what if you want to see
p104
aVhow Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
p105
aVYou zoom in. You really go in.
p106
aVI'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting,
p107
aVand I'm really going to get to the cracks.
p108
aVThis is "The Starry Night,"
p109
aVI think, never seen like this before.
p110
aa(lp111
VI'm going to show you my other favorite feature.
p112
aVThere's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
p113
aVThis is the real cool part. It's called Collections.
p114
aVAny one of you, anybody \u2014
p115
aVdoesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor,
p116
aVif you have a fancy house \u2014 doesn't matter.
p117
aVYou can go and create your own museum online \u2014
p118
aVcreate your own collection across all these images.
p119
aVVery simply, you go in \u2014
p120
aVand I've created this, called The Power of Zoom \u2014
p121
aVyou can just zoom around.
p122
aVThis is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery.
p123
aVYou can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends
p124
aVand really get a conversation going
p125
aVabout what you're feeling
p126
aVwhen you go through these masterpieces.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo I think, in conclusion,
p129
aVfor me, the main thing
p130
aVis that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.
p131
aVIt doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.
p132
aVI probably shouldn't say that.
p133
aVIt really comes from these artists.
p134
aVAnd that's been my humbling experience in this.
p135
aVI mean, I hope in this digital medium
p136
aVthat we do justice to their artwork
p137
aVand represent it properly online.
p138
aVAnd the biggest question I get asked nowadays
p139
aVis, "Did you do this
p140
aVto replicate the experience of going to a museum?"
p141
aVAnd the answer is no.
p142
aVIt's to supplement the experience.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd that's it. Thank you.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Applause)
p147
aa(lp148
VThank you.

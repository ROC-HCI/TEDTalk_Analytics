VI'm going to be talking about designing humor,
p5
aVwhich is sort of an interesting thing, but it goes
p6
aVto some of the discussions about constraints,
p7
aVand how in certain contexts, humor is right,
p8
aVand in other contexts it's wrong.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, I'm from New York,
p11
aVso it's 100 percent satisfaction here.
p12
aVActually, that's ridiculous, because when it comes to humor,
p13
aV75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for.
p14
aVNobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor
p15
aVexcept this woman.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Video) Woman: (Laughs)
p18
aa(lp19
VBob Mankoff: That's my first wife.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVThat part of the relationship went fine.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VNow let's look at this cartoon.
p25
aVOne of the things I'm pointing out is that
p26
aVcartoons appear within the context
p27
aVof The New Yorker magazine,
p28
aVthat lovely Caslon type, and it seems
p29
aVlike a fairly benign cartoon within this context.
p30
aVIt's making a little bit fun of getting older,
p31
aVand, you know, people might like it.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut like I said, you cannot satisfy everyone.
p34
aVYou couldn't satisfy this guy.
p35
aa(lp36
V"Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit.
p37
aVIt's nice, I'm sure to be young and rude,
p38
aVbut some day you'll be old, unless you drop dead as I wish."
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VThe New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment,
p43
aVvery easy for people to get their nose out of joint.
p44
aVAnd one of the things that you realize
p45
aVis it's an unusual environment.
p46
aVHere I'm one person talking to you.
p47
aVYou're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh.
p48
aVIn The New Yorker, it goes out to a wide audience,
p49
aVand when you actually look at that,
p50
aVand nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at,
p51
aVand when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor
p52
aVis really interesting.
p53
aa(lp54
VLet's look at this cartoon.
p55
aa(lp56
V"Discouraging data on the antidepressant."
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VIndeed, it is discouraging.
p61
aVNow, you would think, well, look,
p62
aVmost of you laughed at that.
p63
aVRight? You thought it was funny.
p64
aVIn general, that seems like a funny cartoon,
p65
aVbut let's look what online survey I did.
p66
aVGenerally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.
p67
aVA hundred and nine voted it a 10, the highest. Ten voted it one.
p68
aVBut look at the individual responses.
p69
aa(lp70
V"I like animals!!!!!" Look how much they like them.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aV"I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me."
p73
aa(lp74
VThis person rated it a two.
p75
aV"I don't like to see animals suffer \u2014 even in cartoons."
p76
aa(lp77
VTo people like this, I point out we use anesthetic ink.
p78
aVOther people thought it was funny.
p79
aVThat actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor
p80
aVwhen you don't have the contagion of humor.
p81
aa(lp82
VHumor is a type of entertainment.
p83
aVAll entertainment contains a little frisson of danger,
p84
aVsomething that might happen wrong,
p85
aVand yet we like it when there's protection.
p86
aVThat's what a zoo is. It's danger. The tiger is there.
p87
aVThe bars protect us. That's sort of fun, right?
p88
aVThat's a bad zoo.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVIt's a very politically correct zoo, but it's a bad zoo.
p91
aVBut this is a worse one.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVSo in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker,
p94
aVyou have to see, where is that tiger going to be?
p95
aVWhere is the danger going to exist?
p96
aVHow are you going to manage it?
p97
aVMy job is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week.
p98
aVBut The New Yorker only can take 16 or 17 cartoons,
p99
aVand we have 1,000 cartoons.
p100
aVOf course, many, many cartoons must be rejected.
p101
aVNow, we could fit more cartoons in the magazine
p102
aVif we removed the articles.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVBut I feel that would be a huge loss,
p105
aVone I could live with, but still huge.
p106
aa(lp107
VCartoonists come in through the magazine every week.
p108
aVThe average cartoonist who stays with the magazine
p109
aVdoes 10 or 15 ideas every week.
p110
aVBut they mostly are going to be rejected.
p111
aVThat's the nature of any creative activity.
p112
aVMany of them fade away. Some of them stay.
p113
aa(lp114
VMatt Diffee is one of them.
p115
aVHere's one of his cartoons.
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VDrew Dernavich. "Accounting night at the improv."
p119
aV"Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience
p120
aVto shout out some random numbers."
p121
aa(lp122
VPaul Noth. "He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro-Israel."
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VNow I know all about rejection,
p126
aVbecause when I quit \u2014 actually, I was booted out of \u2014 psychology school
p127
aVand decided to become a cartoonist, a natural segue,
p128
aVfrom 1974 to 1977 I submitted 2,000 cartoons to The New Yorker,
p129
aVand got 2,000 cartoons rejected by The New Yorker.
p130
aVAt a certain point, this rejection slip, in 1977 \u2014
p131
aV[We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.] \u2014
p132
aVmagically changed to this.
p133
aV[Hey! You sold one. No shit! You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.]
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVNow of course that's not what happened,
p136
aVbut that's the emotional truth.
p137
aVAnd of course, that is not New Yorker humor.
p138
aa(lp139
VWhat is New Yorker humor?
p140
aVWell, after 1977, I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons.
p141
aVFinally, in 1980, I received the revered
p142
aVNew Yorker contract,
p143
aVwhich I blurred out parts because it's none of your business.
p144
aa(lp145
VFrom 1980. "Dear Mr. Mankoff, confirming the agreement
p146
aVthere of \u2014 " blah blah blah blah \u2014 blur \u2014
p147
aV"for any idea drawings."
p148
aa(lp149
VWith respect to idea drawings, nowhere in the contract
p150
aVis the word "cartoon" mentioned.
p151
aVThe word "idea drawings," and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons.
p152
aVSo what is an idea drawing? An idea drawing is something
p153
aVthat requires you to think.
p154
aVNow that's not a cartoon. It requires thinking
p155
aVon the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part
p156
aVto make it into a cartoon.
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VHere are some, generally you get my cast of cartoon mind.
p160
aa(lp161
V"There is no justice in the world. There is some justice in the world. The world is just."
p162
aa(lp163
VThis is What Lemmings Believe.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VThe New Yorker and I, when we made comments,
p168
aVthe cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is.
p169
aVWhat is it, the cartoon? Is it really about lemmings?
p170
aVNo. It's about us.
p171
aVYou know, it's my view basically about religion,
p172
aVthat the real conflict and all the fights between religion
p173
aVis who has the best imaginary friend.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd this is my most well-known cartoon.
p177
aV"No, Thursday's out. How about never \u2014 is never good for you?"
p178
aVIt's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off.
p179
aVIt's even on thongs,
p180
aVbut compressed to "How about never \u2014 is never good for you?"
p181
aa(lp182
VNow these look like very different forms of humor
p183
aVbut actually they bear a great similarity.
p184
aVIn each instance, our expectations are defied.
p185
aVIn each instance, the narrative gets switched.
p186
aVThere's an incongruity and a contrast.
p187
aVIn "No, Thursday's out. How about never \u2014 is never good for you?"
p188
aVwhat you have is the syntax of politeness
p189
aVand the message of being rude.
p190
aVThat really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy
p191
aVwhere we mash up these two things which don't go together
p192
aVand temporarily in our minds exist.
p193
aVHe is both being polite and rude.
p194
aVIn here, you have the propriety of The New Yorker
p195
aVand the vulgarity of the language.
p196
aVBasically, that's the way humor works.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo I'm a humor analyst, you would say.
p199
aVNow E.B. White said, analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog.
p200
aVNobody is much interested, and the frog dies.
p201
aVWell, I'm going to kill a few, but there won't be any genocide.
p202
aVBut really, it makes me \u2014
p203
aVLet's look at this picture. This is an interesting picture,
p204
aVThe Laughing Audience.
p205
aVThere are the people, fops up there,
p206
aVbut everybody is laughing, everybody is laughing
p207
aVexcept one guy.
p208
aVThis guy. Who is he? He's the critic.
p209
aVHe's the critic of humor,
p210
aVand really I'm forced to be in that position,
p211
aVwhen I'm at The New Yorker, and that's the danger
p212
aVthat I will become this guy.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow here's a little video made by Matt Diffee, sort of
p215
aVhow they imagine if we really exaggerated that.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Video) Bob Mankoff: "Oooh, no.
p218
aVEhhh.
p219
aVOooh. Hmm. Too funny.
p220
aVNormally I would but I'm in a pissy mood.
p221
aVI'll enjoy it on my own. Perhaps.
p222
aVNo. Nah. No.
p223
aVOverdrawn. Underdrawn.
p224
aVDrawn just right, still not funny enough.
p225
aVNo. No.
p226
aVFor God's sake no, a thousand times no.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Music)
p229
aa(lp230
VNo. No. No. No. No. [Four hours later]
p231
aVHey, that's good, yeah, whatcha got there?
p232
aa(lp233
VOffice worker: Got a ham and swiss on rye?BM: No.
p234
aa(lp235
VOffice worker: Okay. Pastrami on sourdough?BM: No.
p236
aa(lp237
VOffice worker: Smoked turkey with bacon?BM: No.
p238
aa(lp239
VOffice worker: Falafel?BM: Let me look at it.
p240
aVEh, no.
p241
aVOffice worker: Grilled cheese?BM: No.
p242
aVOffice worker: BLT?BM: No.
p243
aa(lp244
VOffice worker: Black forest ham and mozzarella with apple mustard?BM: No.
p245
aa(lp246
VOffice worker: Green bean salad?BM: No.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Music)
p249
aa(lp250
VNo. No.
p251
aVDefinitely no. [Several hours after lunch]
p252
aa(lp253
V(Siren)
p254
aa(lp255
VNo. Get out of here.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VThat's sort of an exaggeration of what I do.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, we do reject, many, many, many cartoons,
p262
aVso many that there are many books called "The Rejection Collection."
p263
aV"The Rejection Collection" is not quite New Yorker kind of humor.
p264
aVAnd you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here
p265
aVwho is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking.
p266
aVSee, that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor.
p267
aVIt's actually put together by Matt Diffee, one of our cartoonists.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor.
p270
aa(lp271
V"I'm thinking about having a child."
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VThere you have an interesting \u2014 the guilty laugh,
p276
aVthe laugh against your better judgment.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
V"Ass-head. Please help."
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, in fact, within a context of this book,
p285
aVwhich says, "Cartoons you never saw and never will see
p286
aVin The New Yorker," this humor is perfect.
p287
aVI'm going to explain why.
p288
aVThere's a concept about humor about it being
p289
aVa benign violation.
p290
aVIn other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think
p291
aVit's both wrong and also okay at the same time.
p292
aVIf we think it's completely wrong, we say, "That's not funny."
p293
aVAnd if it's completely okay, what's the joke? Okay?
p294
aVAnd so, this benign, that's true of "No, Thursday's out. How about never \u2014 is never good for you?"
p295
aVIt's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way.
p296
aVWithin that context, we feel it's okay.
p297
aVSo within this context, "Asshead. Please help"
p298
aVis a benign violation.
p299
aa(lp300
VWithin the context of The New Yorker magazine ...
p301
aV"T-Cell Army: Can the body's immune response
p302
aVhelp treat cancer?" Oh, goodness.
p303
aVYou're reading about this smart stuff,
p304
aVthis intelligent dissection of the immune system.
p305
aVYou glance over at this, and it says,
p306
aV"Asshead. Please help"? God.
p307
aVSo there the violation is malign. It doesn't work.
p308
aVThere is no such thing as funny in and of itself.
p309
aVEverything will be within the context and our expectations.
p310
aa(lp311
VOne way to look at it is this.
p312
aVIt's sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look,
p313
aVa theory about motivation and the mood we're in
p314
aVand how the mood we're in determines the things we like
p315
aVor dislike.
p316
aVWhen we're in a playful mood, we want excitement.
p317
aVWe want high arousal. We feel excited then.
p318
aVIf we're in a purposeful mood, that makes us anxious.
p319
aV"The Rejection Collection" is absolutely in this field.
p320
aVYou want to be stimulated. You want to be aroused.
p321
aVYou want to be transgressed.
p322
aVIt's like this, like an amusement park.
p323
aa(lp324
VVoice: Here we go. (Screams)
p325
aa(lp326
VHe laughs. He is both in danger and safe,
p327
aVincredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed.
p328
aVIf you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough,
p329
aVthey will laugh at very, very little.
p330
aa(lp331
VThis is another cartoon from "The Rejection Collection."
p332
aV"Too snug?"
p333
aVThat's a cartoon about terrorism.
p334
aVThe New Yorker occupies a very different space.
p335
aVIt's a space that is playful in its own way, and also purposeful,
p336
aVand in that space, the cartoons are different.
p337
aa(lp338
VNow I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did
p339
aVright after 9/11, a very, very sensitive area when humor could be used.
p340
aVHow would The New Yorker attack it?
p341
aVIt would not be with a guy with a bomb saying, "Too snug?"
p342
aVOr there was another cartoon I didn't show because
p343
aVactually I thought maybe people would be offended.
p344
aVThe great Sam Gross cartoon, this happened
p345
aVafter the Muhammad controversy where it's Muhammad in heaven,
p346
aVthe suicide bomber is all in little pieces,
p347
aVand he's saying to the suicide bomber,
p348
aV"You'll get the virgins when we find your penis."
p349
aa(lp350
V(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VBetter left undrawn.
p353
aa(lp354
VThe first week we did no cartoons.
p355
aVThat was a black hole for humor, and correctly so.
p356
aVIt's not always appropriate every time.
p357
aVBut the next week, this was the first cartoon.
p358
aa(lp359
V"I thought I'd never laugh again. Then I saw your jacket."
p360
aa(lp361
VIt basically was about, if we were alive,
p362
aVwe were going to laugh. We were going to breathe.
p363
aVWe were going to exist. Here's another one.
p364
aa(lp365
V"I figure if I don't have that third martini, then the terrorists win."
p366
aa(lp367
VThese cartoons are not about them. They're about us.
p368
aVThe humor reflects back on us.
p369
aVThe easiest thing to do with humor, and it's perfectly legitimate,
p370
aVis a friend makes fun of an enemy.
p371
aVIt's called dispositional humor.
p372
aVIt's 95 percent of the humor. It's not our humor.
p373
aa(lp374
VHere's another cartoon.
p375
aa(lp376
V"I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state."
p377
aa(lp378
V(Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
VHumor does need a target.
p381
aVBut interestingly, in The New Yorker, the target is us.
p382
aVThe target is the readership and the people who do it.
p383
aVThe humor is self-reflective
p384
aVand makes us think about our assumptions.
p385
aVLook at this cartoon by Roz Chast, the guy reading the obituary.
p386
aa(lp387
V"Two years younger than you, 12 years older than you,
p388
aVthree years your junior, your age on the dot,
p389
aVexactly your age."
p390
aa(lp391
VThat is a deeply profound cartoon.
p392
aVAnd so The New Yorker is also trying to, in some way,
p393
aVmake cartoons say something besides funny
p394
aVand something about us. Here's another one.
p395
aa(lp396
V"I started my vegetarianism for health reasons,
p397
aVThen it became a moral choice, and now it's just to annoy people."
p398
aa(lp399
V(Laughter)
p400
aa(lp401
V"Excuse me \u2014 I think there's something wrong with this
p402
aVin a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint."
p403
aa(lp404
VSo it focuses on our obsessions, our narcissism,
p405
aVour foils and our foibles, really not someone else's.
p406
aa(lp407
VThe New Yorker demands
p408
aVsome cognitive work on your part,
p409
aVand what it demands is what Arthur Koestler,
p410
aVwho wrote "The Act of Creation" about the relationship
p411
aVbetween humor, art and science,
p412
aVis what's called bisociation.
p413
aVYou have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference,
p414
aVand you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon.
p415
aVIf the different frames of reference don't come together
p416
aVin about .5 seconds, it's not funny,
p417
aVbut I think they will for you here.
p418
aVDifferent frames of reference.
p419
aa(lp420
V"You slept with her, didn't you?"
p421
aa(lp422
V(Laughter)
p423
aa(lp424
V"Lassie! Get help!!"
p425
aa(lp426
V(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
VIt's called French Army Knife.
p429
aa(lp430
V(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
VAnd this is Einstein in bed. "To you it was fast."
p433
aa(lp434
V(Laughter)
p435
aa(lp436
VNow there are some cartoons that are puzzling.
p437
aVLike, this cartoon would puzzle many people.
p438
aVHow many people know what this cartoon means?
p439
aVThe dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk.
p440
aVThis is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog.
p441
aVThat's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year
p442
aVcalled "I Don't Get It: The New Yorker Cartoon I.Q. Test."
p443
aV(Laughter)
p444
aa(lp445
VThe other thing The New Yorker plays around with
p446
aVis incongruity, and incongruity, I've shown you,
p447
aVis sort of the basis of humor.
p448
aVSomething that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny.
p449
aVBut the way incongruity works is, observational humor
p450
aVis humor within the realm of reality.
p451
aa(lp452
V"My boss is always telling me what to do." Okay?
p453
aVThat could happen. It's humor within the realm of reality.
p454
aa(lp455
VHere, cowboy to a cow:
p456
aV"Very impressive. I'd like to find 5,000 more like you."
p457
aa(lp458
VWe understand that. It's absurd. But we're putting the two together.
p459
aa(lp460
VHere, in the nonsense range:
p461
aa(lp462
V"Damn it, Hopkins, didn't you get yesterday's memo?"
p463
aa(lp464
VNow that's a little puzzling, right? It doesn't quite come together.
p465
aVIn general, people who enjoy more nonsense,
p466
aVenjoy more abstract art,
p467
aVthey tend to be liberal, less conservative, that type of stuff.
p468
aVBut for us, and for me, helping design the humor,
p469
aVit doesn't make any sense to compare one to the other.

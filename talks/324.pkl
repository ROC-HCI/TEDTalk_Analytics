VLet's just start by looking at some great photographs.
p5
aVThis is an icon of National Geographic,
p6
aVan Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.
p7
aVBut the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out
p8
aVwith a parody of National Geographic,
p9
aVand I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph.
p10
aVOh, the wrath of Photoshop.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale.
p13
aVHe mounted a camera on the tail.
p14
aVA poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell.
p15
aVPygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson.
p16
aVI love this photograph because it reminds me
p17
aVof Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer.
p18
aVA polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen.
p19
aVPolar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth \u2014
p20
aVthey're not very good swimmers \u2014
p21
aVand we know what's happening to the ice.
p22
aVThese are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa,
p23
aVphotographed by Chris Johns.
p24
aVShot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels.
p25
aVThis is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard,
p26
aVa great portraitist.
p27
aVAnd Jane Goodall, making her own special connection,
p28
aVphotographed by Nick Nichols.
p29
aVThis is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey.
p30
aVAnd David said that there was lot of weird stuff
p31
aVhappening on the dance floor.
p32
aVBut, hey, at least it's hygienic.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVThese are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance,
p35
aVby David Doubilet.
p36
aVAnd this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason.
p37
aVAnd finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars,
p38
aVphotographed by Emory Kristof.
p39
aVPhotography carries a power that holds up
p40
aVunder the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world,
p41
aVbecause photographs emulate the way
p42
aVthat our mind freezes a significant moment.
p43
aa(lp44
VHere's an example.
p45
aVFour years ago, I was at the beach with my son,
p46
aVand he was learning how to swim
p47
aVin this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches.
p48
aVBut I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide
p49
aVand started to be pulled out towards the jetty.
p50
aVI can stand here right now and see,
p51
aVas I go tearing into the water after him,
p52
aVthe moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement.
p53
aVI can see the rocks are over here.
p54
aVThere's a wave about to crash onto him.
p55
aVI can see his hands reaching out,
p56
aVand I can see his face in terror,
p57
aVlooking at me, saying, "Help me, Dad."
p58
aVI got him. The wave broke over us.
p59
aVWe got back on shore; he was fine.
p60
aVWe were a little bit rattled.
p61
aVBut this flashbulb memory, as it's called,
p62
aVis when all the elements came together to define
p63
aVnot just the event, but my emotional connection to it.
p64
aVAnd this is what a photograph taps into
p65
aVwhen it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow I have to tell you,
p68
aVI was talking to Kyle last week about this,
p69
aVthat I was going to tell this story.
p70
aVAnd he said, "Oh, yeah, I remember that too!
p71
aVI remember my image of you
p72
aVwas that you were up on the shore yelling at me."
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVI thought I was a hero.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VSo,
p78
aVthis represents \u2014 this is a cross-sample of
p79
aVsome remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,
p80
aVworking at the very top of their craft \u2014
p81
aVexcept one.
p82
aVThis photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason
p83
aVin New Zealand last year,
p84
aVand it was submitted and published in National Geographic.
p85
aVLast year, we added a section to our website called "Your Shot,"
p86
aVwhere anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.
p87
aVAnd it has become a wild success,
p88
aVtapping into the enthusiast photography community.
p89
aVThe quality of these amateur photographs
p90
aVcan, at times, be amazing.
p91
aVAnd seeing this reinforces, for me,
p92
aVthat every one of us has at least one or two
p93
aVgreat photographs in them.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut to be a great photojournalist,
p96
aVyou have to have more than just one or two
p97
aVgreat photographs in you.
p98
aVYou've got to be able to make them all the time.
p99
aVBut even more importantly,
p100
aVyou need to know how to create a visual narrative.
p101
aVYou need to know how to tell a story.
p102
aVSo I'm going to share with you some coverages
p103
aVthat I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.
p104
aa(lp105
VPhotographer Nick Nichols went to document
p106
aVa very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary
p107
aVin Chad, called Zakouma.
p108
aVThe original intent was to travel there
p109
aVand bring back a classic story of diverse species,
p110
aVof an exotic locale.
p111
aVAnd that is what Nick did, up to a point.
p112
aVThis is a serval cat.
p113
aVHe's actually taking his own picture,
p114
aVshot with what's called a camera trap.
p115
aVThere's an infrared beam that's going across,
p116
aVand he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.
p117
aVThese are baboons at a watering hole.
p118
aVNick \u2014 the camera, again, an automatic camera
p119
aVtook thousands of pictures of this.
p120
aVAnd Nick ended up with a lot of pictures
p121
aVof the rear ends of baboons.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVA lion having a late night snack \u2014
p124
aVnotice he's got a broken tooth.
p125
aVAnd a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.
p126
aVI love this little bit of water
p127
aVthat comes off the back of his tail.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants.
p130
aVIt's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.
p131
aVHere's a photograph shot in moonlight,
p132
aVsomething that digital photography has made a big difference for.
p133
aVIt was with the elephants that this story pivoted.
p134
aVNick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,
p135
aVcollared the matriarch of the herd.
p136
aVThey named her Annie,
p137
aVand they began tracking her movements.
p138
aVThe herd was safe within the confines of the park,
p139
aVbecause of this dedicated group of park rangers.
p140
aVBut once the annual rains began,
p141
aVthe herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd that's when they ran into trouble.
p144
aVFor outside the safety of the park were poachers,
p145
aVwho would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.
p146
aVThe matriarch that they were radio tracking,
p147
aVafter weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,
p148
aVcame to a halt outside the park.
p149
aVAnnie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.
p150
aVAnd they only came for the ivory.
p151
aVThis is actually one of the rangers.
p152
aVThey were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,
p153
aVbecause they couldn't leave it there,
p154
aVbecause it's still valuable.
p155
aVBut what Nick did was he brought back
p156
aVa story that went beyond the old-school method
p157
aVof just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?"
p158
aVAnd instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.
p159
aVInstead of just knowledge of this park,
p160
aVhe created an understanding and an empathy
p161
aVfor the elephants, the rangers and the many issues
p162
aVsurrounding human-wildlife conflicts.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow let's go over to India.
p165
aVSometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.
p166
aVWe were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman
p167
aVtouches upon in his new world population project.
p168
aVFor the first time in history,
p169
aVmore people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.
p170
aVAnd most of that growth is not in the cities,
p171
aVbut in the slums that surround them.
p172
aVJonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,
p173
aVcame to me and said,
p174
aV"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.
p175
aVLet's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world."
p176
aVAnd I said, "Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget."
p177
aVSo instead, what we did was
p178
aVwe decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result
p179
aVin what we'd consider sort of a survey story \u2014
p180
aVwhere you just go in and see just a little bit of everything \u2014
p181
aVwe put Jonas into Dharavi,
p182
aVwhich is part of Mumbai, India,
p183
aVand let him stay there, and really get into
p184
aVthe heart and soul of this really major part of the city.
p185
aVWhat Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look
p186
aVat the awful conditions that exist in such places.
p187
aVHe saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part
p188
aVof how the entire urban area functioned.
p189
aVBy staying tightly focused in one place,
p190
aVJonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit
p191
aVthat underlies this community.
p192
aVAnd he did it in a beautiful way.
p193
aa(lp194
VSometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.
p195
aVWe teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry
p196
aVand photojournalist Randy Olson
p197
aVto document the depletion of the world's fisheries.
p198
aVWe weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,
p199
aVbut the photographs that Brian and Randy created
p200
aVare among the best to capture both the human
p201
aVand natural devastation of overfishing.
p202
aVHere, in a photo by Brian,
p203
aVa seemingly crucified shark is caught up
p204
aVin a gill net off of Baja.
p205
aVI've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,
p206
aVthe animals accidentally scooped up
p207
aVwhile fishing for a specific species.
p208
aVBut here, Brian captured a unique view
p209
aVby positioning himself underneath the boat
p210
aVwhen they threw the waste overboard.
p211
aVAnd Brian then went on to even greater risk
p212
aVto get this never-before-made photograph
p213
aVof a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.
p214
aa(lp215
VBack on land, Randy Olson photographed
p216
aVa makeshift fish market in Africa,
p217
aVwhere the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,
p218
aVthe main parts having already been sent to Europe.
p219
aVAnd here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.
p220
aVAs prime food sources are depleted,
p221
aVthe harvest goes deeper into the oceans
p222
aVand brings in more such sources of protein.
p223
aVThis is called fishing down the food chain.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut there are also glimmers of hope,
p226
aVand I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,
p227
aVwe don't really want to go
p228
aVand just look at all the problems.
p229
aVWe also want to look for solutions.
p230
aVBrian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,
p231
aVwhere commercial fishing had been banned \u2014
p232
aVthe result being that the overfished species have been restored,
p233
aVand with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.
p234
aa(lp235
VPhotography can also compel us to confront
p236
aVissues that are potentially distressing and controversial.
p237
aVJames Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,
p238
aVtook a look at the sweep of the medical system
p239
aVthat is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.
p240
aVIt is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end
p241
aVand exits back home, on the other.
p242
aVJim started in the battlefield.
p243
aVHere, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier
p244
aVon the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.
p245
aVHere is in the field hospital.
p246
aVThe soldier on the right has the name of his daughter
p247
aVtattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.
p248
aVFrom here, the more severely wounded are transported
p249
aVback to Germany, where they meet up with their families
p250
aVfor the first time.
p251
aVAnd then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,
p252
aVsuch as here in Walter Reed.
p253
aVAnd finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,
p254
aVthey exit the medical system and attempt
p255
aVto regain their pre-war lives.
p256
aVJim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story
p257
aVand gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.
p258
aa(lp259
VNow, these stories are great examples
p260
aVof how photography can be used
p261
aVto address some of our most important topics.
p262
aVBut there are also times when photographers
p263
aVsimply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,
p264
aVjust plain fun.
p265
aVPhotographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica
p266
aVto shoot a story on leopard seals.
p267
aVThey have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered
p268
aVone of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.
p269
aVIn fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been
p270
aVgrabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.
p271
aVSo you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant
p272
aVabout getting into the water.
p273
aVNow, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.
p274
aVYou know of "The March of the Penguins."
p275
aVThis is sort of the munch of the penguins.
p276
aV(Laughter)
p277
aVHere a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out
p278
aVto see if the coast is clear.
p279
aVAnd then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.
p280
aa(lp281
VBut then Paul got in the water.
p282
aVAnd he said he was never really afraid of this.
p283
aVWell, this one female came up to him.
p284
aVShe's probably \u2014 it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,
p285
aVbut she's 12 feet long.
p286
aVSo, she is pretty significant in size.
p287
aVAnd Paul said he was never really afraid,
p288
aVbecause she was more curious about him than threatened.
p289
aVThis mouthing behavior, on the right,
p290
aVwas really her way of saying to him, "Hey, look how big I am!"
p291
aVOr you know, "My, what big teeth you have."
p292
aV(Laughter)
p293
aVThen Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.
p294
aVTo her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water
p295
aVthat for some reason didn't seem to be interested
p296
aVin chasing penguins.
p297
aVSo what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,
p298
aValive, and put them in front of him.
p299
aVShe dropped them off, and then they would swim away.
p300
aVShe'd kind of look at him, like "What are you doing?"
p301
aVGo back and get them, and then bring them back
p302
aVand drop them in front of him.
p303
aVAnd she did this over the course of a couple of days,
p304
aVuntil the point where she got so frustrated with him
p305
aVthat she started putting them directly on top of his head.
p306
aV(Laughter)
p307
aVWhich just resulted in a fantastic photograph.
p308
aV(Laughter)
p309
aVEventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured
p310
aVthat he was never going to survive.
p311
aVThis is her just puffing out, you know,
p312
aVsnorting out in disgust.
p313
aV(Laughter)
p314
aVAnd lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.
p315
aa(lp316
VPaul set out to photograph a relatively
p317
aVmysterious and unknown creature,
p318
aVand came back with not just a collection of photographs,
p319
aVbut an amazing experience and a great story.
p320
aVIt is these kinds of stories,
p321
aVones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial
p322
aVthat demonstrate the power of photojournalism.
p323
aVI believe that photography can make a real connection to people,
p324
aVand can be employed as a positive agent
p325
aVfor understanding the challenges and opportunities
p326
aVfacing our world today.
p327
aVThank you.
p328
aV(Applause)

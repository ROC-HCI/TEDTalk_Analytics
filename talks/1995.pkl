VI study ants
p5
aVin the desert, in the tropical forest
p6
aVand in my kitchen,
p7
aVand in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live.
p8
aVI've recently realized that ants
p9
aVare using interactions differently
p10
aVin different environments,
p11
aVand that got me thinking that we could learn from this
p12
aVabout other systems,
p13
aVlike brains and data networks that we engineer,
p14
aVand even cancer.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo what all these systems have in common
p17
aVis that there's no central control.
p18
aVAn ant colony consists of sterile female workers \u2014
p19
aVthose are the ants you see walking around \u2014
p20
aVand then one or more reproductive females
p21
aVwho just lay the eggs.
p22
aVThey don't give any instructions.
p23
aVEven though they're called queens,
p24
aVthey don't tell anybody what to do.
p25
aVSo in an ant colony, there's no one in charge,
p26
aVand all systems like this without central control
p27
aVare regulated using very simple interactions.
p28
aVAnts interact using smell.
p29
aVThey smell with their antennae,
p30
aVand they interact with their antennae,
p31
aVso when one ant touches another with its antennae,
p32
aVit can tell, for example, if the other ant
p33
aVis a nestmate
p34
aVand what task that other ant has been doing.
p35
aVSo here you see a lot of ants moving around
p36
aVand interacting in a lab arena
p37
aVthat's connected by tubes to two other arenas.
p38
aVSo when one ant meets another,
p39
aVit doesn't matter which ant it meets,
p40
aVand they're actually not transmitting
p41
aVany kind of complicated signal or message.
p42
aVAll that matters to the ant is the rate
p43
aVat which it meets other ants.
p44
aVAnd all of these interactions, taken together,
p45
aVproduce a network.
p46
aVSo this is the network of the ants
p47
aVthat you just saw moving around in the arena,
p48
aVand it's this constantly shifting network
p49
aVthat produces the behavior of the colony,
p50
aVlike whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest,
p51
aVor how many are going out to forage.
p52
aVA brain actually works in the same way,
p53
aVbut what's great about ants is
p54
aVthat you can see the whole network as it happens.
p55
aa(lp56
VThere are more than 12,000 species of ants,
p57
aVin every conceivable environment,
p58
aVand they're using interactions differently
p59
aVto meet different environmental challenges.
p60
aVSo one important environmental challenge
p61
aVthat every system has to deal with
p62
aVis operating costs, just what it takes
p63
aVto run the system.
p64
aVAnd another environmental challenge is resources,
p65
aVfinding them and collecting them.
p66
aVIn the desert, operating costs are high
p67
aVbecause water is scarce,
p68
aVand the seed-eating ants that I study in the desert
p69
aVhave to spend water to get water.
p70
aVSo an ant outside foraging,
p71
aVsearching for seeds in the hot sun,
p72
aVjust loses water into the air.
p73
aVBut the colony gets its water
p74
aVby metabolizing the fats out of the seeds
p75
aVthat they eat.
p76
aVSo in this environment, interactions are used
p77
aVto activate foraging.
p78
aVAn outgoing forager doesn't go out unless
p79
aVit gets enough interactions with returning foragers,
p80
aVand what you see are the returning foragers
p81
aVgoing into the tunnel, into the nest,
p82
aVand meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.
p83
aVThis makes sense for the ant colony,
p84
aVbecause the more food there is out there,
p85
aVthe more quickly the foragers find it,
p86
aVthe faster they come back,
p87
aVand the more foragers they send out.
p88
aVThe system works to stay stopped,
p89
aVunless something positive happens.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo interactions function to activate foragers.
p92
aVAnd we've been studying the evolution of this system.
p93
aVFirst of all, there's variation.
p94
aVIt turns out that colonies are different.
p95
aVOn dry days, some colonies forage less,
p96
aVso colonies are different in how
p97
aVthey manage this trade-off
p98
aVbetween spending water to search for seeds
p99
aVand getting water back in the form of seeds.
p100
aVAnd we're trying to understand why
p101
aVsome colonies forage less than others
p102
aVby thinking about ants as neurons,
p103
aVusing models from neuroscience.
p104
aVSo just as a neuron adds up its stimulation
p105
aVfrom other neurons to decide whether to fire,
p106
aVan ant adds up its stimulation from other ants
p107
aVto decide whether to forage.
p108
aVAnd what we're looking for is whether there might be
p109
aVsmall differences among colonies
p110
aVin how many interactions each ant needs
p111
aVbefore it's willing to go out and forage,
p112
aVbecause a colony like that would forage less.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd this raises an analogous question about brains.
p115
aVWe talk about the brain,
p116
aVbut of course every brain is slightly different,
p117
aVand maybe there are some individuals
p118
aVor some conditions
p119
aVin which the electrical properties of neurons are such
p120
aVthat they require more stimulus to fire,
p121
aVand that would lead to differences in brain function.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo in order to ask evolutionary questions,
p124
aVwe need to know about reproductive success.
p125
aVThis is a map of the study site
p126
aVwhere I have been tracking this population
p127
aVof harvester ant colonies for 28 years,
p128
aVwhich is about as long as a colony lives.
p129
aVEach symbol is a colony,
p130
aVand the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had,
p131
aVbecause we were able to use genetic variation
p132
aVto match up parent and offspring colonies,
p133
aVthat is, to figure out which colonies
p134
aVwere founded by a daughter queen
p135
aVproduced by which parent colony.
p136
aVAnd this was amazing for me, after all these years,
p137
aVto find out, for example, that colony 154,
p138
aVwhom I've known well for many years,
p139
aVis a great-grandmother.
p140
aVHere's her daughter colony,
p141
aVhere's her granddaughter colony,
p142
aVand these are her great-granddaughter colonies.
p143
aVAnd by doing this, I was able to learn
p144
aVthat offspring colonies resemble parent colonies
p145
aVin their decisions about which days are so hot
p146
aVthat they don't forage,
p147
aVand the offspring of parent colonies
p148
aVlive so far from each other that the ants never meet,
p149
aVso the ants of the offspring colony
p150
aVcan't be learning this from the parent colony.
p151
aVAnd so our next step is to look
p152
aVfor the genetic variation underlying this resemblance.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo then I was able to ask, okay, who's doing better?
p155
aVOver the time of the study,
p156
aVand especially in the past 10 years,
p157
aVthere's been a very severe and deepening drought
p158
aVin the Southwestern U.S.,
p159
aVand it turns out that the colonies that conserve water,
p160
aVthat stay in when it's really hot outside,
p161
aVand thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible,
p162
aVare the ones more likely to have offspring colonies.
p163
aVSo all this time, I thought that colony 154
p164
aVwas a loser, because on really dry days,
p165
aVthere'd be just this trickle of foraging,
p166
aVwhile the other colonies were out
p167
aVforaging, getting lots of food,
p168
aVbut in fact, colony 154 is a huge success.
p169
aVShe's a matriarch.
p170
aVShe's one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site.
p171
aVTo my knowledge, this is the first time
p172
aVthat we've been able to track
p173
aVthe ongoing evolution of collective behavior
p174
aVin a natural population of animals
p175
aVand find out what's actually working best.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, the Internet uses an algorithm
p178
aVto regulate the flow of data
p179
aVthat's very similar to the one
p180
aVthat the harvester ants are using to regulate
p181
aVthe flow of foragers.
p182
aVAnd guess what we call this analogy?
p183
aVThe anternet is coming.
p184
aV(Applause)
p185
aVSo data doesn't leave the source computer
p186
aVunless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth
p187
aVfor it to travel on.
p188
aVIn the early days of the Internet,
p189
aVwhen operating costs were really high
p190
aVand it was really important not to lose any data,
p191
aVthen the system was set up for interactions
p192
aVto activate the flow of data.
p193
aVIt's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm
p194
aVthat's so similar to the one that we recently invented,
p195
aVbut this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms
p196
aVthat we know about,
p197
aVand ants have had 130 million years
p198
aVto evolve a lot of good ones,
p199
aVand I think it's very likely
p200
aVthat some of the other 12,000 species
p201
aVare going to have interesting algorithms
p202
aVfor data networks
p203
aVthat we haven't even thought of yet.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo what happens when operating costs are low?
p206
aVOperating costs are low in the tropics,
p207
aVbecause it's very humid, and it's easy for the ants
p208
aVto be outside walking around.
p209
aVBut the ants are so abundant
p210
aVand diverse in the tropics
p211
aVthat there's a lot of competition.
p212
aVWhatever resource one species is using,
p213
aVanother species is likely to be using that
p214
aVat the same time.
p215
aVSo in this environment, interactions are used
p216
aVin the opposite way.
p217
aVThe system keeps going
p218
aVunless something negative happens,
p219
aVand one species that I study makes circuits
p220
aVin the trees of foraging ants
p221
aVgoing from the nest to a food source and back,
p222
aVjust round and round,
p223
aVunless something negative happens,
p224
aVlike an interaction
p225
aVwith ants of another species.
p226
aVSo here's an example of ant security.
p227
aVIn the middle, there's an ant
p228
aVplugging the nest entrance with its head
p229
aVin response to interactions with another species.
p230
aVThose are the little ones running around
p231
aVwith their abdomens up in the air.
p232
aVBut as soon as the threat is passed,
p233
aVthe entrance is open again,
p234
aVand maybe there are situations
p235
aVin computer security
p236
aVwhere operating costs are low enough
p237
aVthat we could just block access temporarily
p238
aVin response to an immediate threat,
p239
aVand then open it again,
p240
aVinstead of trying to build
p241
aVa permanent firewall or fortress.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo another environmental challenge
p244
aVthat all systems have to deal with
p245
aVis resources, finding and collecting them.
p246
aVAnd to do this, ants solve the problem
p247
aVof collective search,
p248
aVand this is a problem that's of great interest
p249
aVright now in robotics,
p250
aVbecause we've understood that,
p251
aVrather than sending a single,
p252
aVsophisticated, expensive robot out
p253
aVto explore another planet
p254
aVor to search a burning building,
p255
aVthat instead, it may be more effective
p256
aVto get a group of cheaper robots
p257
aVexchanging only minimal information,
p258
aVand that's the way that ants do it.
p259
aVSo the invasive Argentine ant
p260
aVmakes expandable search networks.
p261
aVThey're good at dealing with the main problem
p262
aVof collective search,
p263
aVwhich is the trade-off between
p264
aVsearching very thoroughly
p265
aVand covering a lot of ground.
p266
aVAnd what they do is,
p267
aVwhen there are many ants in a small space,
p268
aVthen each one can search very thoroughly
p269
aVbecause there will be another ant nearby
p270
aVsearching over there,
p271
aVbut when there are a few ants
p272
aVin a large space,
p273
aVthen they need to stretch out their paths
p274
aVto cover more ground.
p275
aVI think they use interactions to assess density,
p276
aVso when they're really crowded,
p277
aVthey meet more often,
p278
aVand they search more thoroughly.
p279
aVDifferent ant species must use different algorithms,
p280
aVbecause they've evolved to deal with
p281
aVdifferent resources,
p282
aVand it could be really useful to know about this,
p283
aVand so we recently asked ants
p284
aVto solve the collective search problem
p285
aVin the extreme environment
p286
aVof microgravity
p287
aVin the International Space Station.
p288
aVWhen I first saw this picture, I thought,
p289
aVOh no, they've mounted the habitat vertically,
p290
aVbut then I realized that, of course, it doesn't matter.
p291
aVSo the idea here is that the ants
p292
aVare working so hard to hang on
p293
aVto the wall or the floor or whatever you call it
p294
aVthat they're less likely to interact,
p295
aVand so the relationship between
p296
aVhow crowded they are and how often they meet
p297
aVwould be messed up.
p298
aVWe're still analyzing the data.
p299
aVI don't have the results yet.
p300
aVBut it would be interesting to know
p301
aVhow other species solve this problem
p302
aVin different environments on Earth,
p303
aVand so we're setting up a program
p304
aVto encourage kids around the world
p305
aVto try this experiment with different species.
p306
aVIt's very simple.
p307
aVIt can be done with cheap materials.
p308
aVAnd that way, we could make a global map
p309
aVof ant collective search algorithms.
p310
aVAnd I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species,
p311
aVthe ones that come into our buildings,
p312
aVare going to be really good at this,
p313
aVbecause they're in your kitchen
p314
aVbecause they're really good at finding food and water.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo the most familiar resource for ants
p317
aVis a picnic,
p318
aVand this is a clustered resource.
p319
aVWhen there's one piece of fruit,
p320
aVthere's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby,
p321
aVand the ants that specialize on clustered resources
p322
aVuse interactions for recruitment.
p323
aVSo when one ant meets another,
p324
aVor when it meets a chemical deposited
p325
aVon the ground by another,
p326
aVthen it changes direction to follow
p327
aVin the direction of the interaction,
p328
aVand that's how you get the trail of ants
p329
aVsharing your picnic.
p330
aa(lp331
VNow this is a place where I think we might be able
p332
aVto learn something from ants about cancer.
p333
aVI mean, first, it's obvious that we could do a lot
p334
aVto prevent cancer
p335
aVby not allowing people to spread around
p336
aVor sell the toxins that promote
p337
aVthe evolution of cancer in our bodies,
p338
aVbut I don't think the ants can help us much with this
p339
aVbecause ants never poison their own colonies.
p340
aVBut we might be able to learn something from ants
p341
aVabout treating cancer.
p342
aVThere are many different kinds of cancer.
p343
aVEach one originates in a particular part of the body,
p344
aVand then some kinds of cancer will spread
p345
aVor metastasize to particular other tissues
p346
aVwhere they must be getting resources that they need.
p347
aVSo if you think from the perspective
p348
aVof early metastatic cancer cells
p349
aVas they're out searching around
p350
aVfor the resources that they need,
p351
aVif those resources are clustered,
p352
aVthey're likely to use interactions for recruitment,
p353
aVand if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting,
p354
aVthen maybe we could set traps
p355
aVto catch them before they become established.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo ants are using interactions in different ways
p358
aVin a huge variety of environments,
p359
aVand we could learn from this
p360
aVabout other systems that operate
p361
aVwithout central control.
p362
aVUsing only simple interactions,
p363
aVant colonies have been performing
p364
aVamazing feats for more than 130 million years.
p365
aVWe have a lot to learn from them.
p366
aa(lp367
VThank you.

When conditions are tough, natural selection favors colonies that conserve resources. </p><p>Her studies of ant colonies have led her and her Stanford colleagues to the discovery of the &ldquo;Anternet,&rdquo; which regulates foraging in ants in the same way the internet regulates data traffic.

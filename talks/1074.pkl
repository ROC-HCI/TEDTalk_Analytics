VWe're here to celebrate compassion.
p5
aVBut compassion, from my vantage point,
p6
aVhas a problem.
p7
aVAs essential as it is across our traditions,
p8
aVas real as so many of us know it to be
p9
aVin particular lives,
p10
aVthe word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture,
p11
aVand it is suspect in my field of journalism.
p12
aVIt's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing,
p13
aVor it's seen as potentially depressing.
p14
aVKaren Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story
p15
aVof giving a speech in Holland
p16
aVand, after the fact, the word "compassion"
p17
aVwas translated as "pity."
p18
aa(lp19
VNow compassion, when it enters the news,
p20
aVtoo often comes in the form
p21
aVof feel-good feature pieces
p22
aVor sidebars about heroic people
p23
aVyou could never be like
p24
aVor happy endings
p25
aVor examples of self-sacrifice
p26
aVthat would seem to be too good to be true
p27
aVmost of the time.
p28
aVOur cultural imagination about compassion
p29
aVhas been deadened by idealistic images.
p30
aVAnd so what I'd like to do this morning
p31
aVfor the next few minutes
p32
aVis perform a linguistic resurrection.
p33
aVAnd I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise
p34
aVthat words matter,
p35
aVthat they shape the way we understand ourselves,
p36
aVthe way we interpret the world
p37
aVand the way we treat others.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhen this country
p40
aVfirst encountered genuine diversity
p41
aVin the 1960s,
p42
aVwe adopted tolerance
p43
aVas the core civic virtue
p44
aVwith which we would approach that.
p45
aVNow the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary,
p46
aVconnotes "allowing," "indulging"
p47
aVand "enduring."
p48
aVIn the medical context that it comes from,
p49
aVit is about testing the limits of thriving
p50
aVin an unfavorable environment.
p51
aVTolerance is not really a lived virtue;
p52
aVit's more of a cerebral ascent.
p53
aVAnd it's too cerebral
p54
aVto animate guts and hearts
p55
aVand behavior
p56
aVwhen the going gets rough.
p57
aVAnd the going is pretty rough right now.
p58
aVI think that without perhaps being able to name it,
p59
aVwe are collectively experiencing
p60
aVthat we've come as far as we can
p61
aVwith tolerance as our only guiding virtue.
p62
aa(lp63
VCompassion is a worthy successor.
p64
aVIt is organic,
p65
aVacross our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions,
p66
aVand yet it transcends them.
p67
aVCompassion is a piece of vocabulary
p68
aVthat could change us if we truly let it sink into
p69
aVthe standards to which we hold ourselves and others,
p70
aVboth in our private and in our civic spaces.
p71
aVSo what is it, three-dimensionally?
p72
aVWhat are its kindred and component parts?
p73
aVWhat's in its universe of attendant virtues?
p74
aVTo start simply,
p75
aVI want to say that compassion is kind.
p76
aVNow "kindness" might sound like a very mild word,
p77
aVand it's prone to its own abundant cliche.
p78
aVBut kindness is an everyday byproduct
p79
aVof all the great virtues.
p80
aVAnd it is a most edifying form
p81
aVof instant gratification.
p82
aa(lp83
VCompassion is also curious.
p84
aVCompassion cultivates and practices curiosity.
p85
aVI love a phrase that was offered me
p86
aVby two young women
p87
aVwho are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles,
p88
aVAziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi.
p89
aVThey are working to create a new imagination
p90
aVabout shared life among young Jews and Muslims,
p91
aVand as they do that, they cultivate what they call
p92
aV"curiosity without assumptions."
p93
aVWell that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.
p94
aa(lp95
VCompassion can be synonymous with empathy.
p96
aVIt can be joined with the harder work
p97
aVof forgiveness and reconciliation,
p98
aVbut it can also express itself
p99
aVin the simple act of presence.
p100
aVIt's linked to practical virtues
p101
aVlike generosity and hospitality
p102
aVand just being there,
p103
aVjust showing up.
p104
aVI think that compassion
p105
aValso is often linked to beauty \u2014
p106
aVand by that I mean a willingness
p107
aVto see beauty in the other,
p108
aVnot just what it is about them
p109
aVthat might need helping.
p110
aVI love it that my Muslim conversation partners
p111
aVoften speak of beauty as a core moral value.
p112
aVAnd in that light, for the religious,
p113
aVcompassion also brings us
p114
aVinto the territory of mystery \u2014
p115
aVencouraging us not just
p116
aVto see beauty,
p117
aVbut perhaps also to look for the face of God
p118
aVin the moment of suffering,
p119
aVin the face of a stranger,
p120
aVin the face of the vibrant religious other.
p121
aa(lp122
VI'm not sure if I can show you
p123
aVwhat tolerance looks like,
p124
aVbut I can show you what compassion looks like \u2014
p125
aVbecause it is visible.
p126
aVWhen we see it, we recognize it
p127
aVand it changes the way we think about what is doable,
p128
aVwhat is possible.
p129
aVIt is so important
p130
aVwhen we're communicating big ideas \u2014
p131
aVbut especially a big spiritual idea like compassion \u2014
p132
aVto root it as we present it to others
p133
aVin space and time and flesh and blood \u2014
p134
aVthe color and complexity of life.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd compassion does seek physicality.
p137
aVI first started to learn this most vividly
p138
aVfrom Matthew Sanford.
p139
aVAnd I don't imagine that you will realize this
p140
aVwhen you look at this photograph of him,
p141
aVbut he's paraplegic.
p142
aVHe's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13,
p143
aVin a car crash that killed his father and his sister.
p144
aVMatthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again,
p145
aVand \u2014 and he does experience this as an "and"
p146
aVrather than a "but" \u2014
p147
aVand he experiences himself
p148
aVto be healed and whole.
p149
aVAnd as a teacher of yoga,
p150
aVhe brings that experience to others
p151
aVacross the spectrum of ability and disability,
p152
aVhealth, illness and aging.
p153
aVHe says that he's just at an extreme end
p154
aVof the spectrum we're all on.
p155
aVHe's doing some amazing work now
p156
aVwith veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.
p157
aVAnd Matthew has made this remarkable observation
p158
aVthat I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.
p159
aVI can't quite explain it, and he can't either.
p160
aVBut he says that he has yet to experience someone
p161
aVwho became more aware of their body,
p162
aVin all its frailty and its grace,
p163
aVwithout, at the same time,
p164
aVbecoming more compassionate towards all of life.
p165
aa(lp166
VCompassion also looks like this.
p167
aVThis is Jean Vanier.
p168
aVJean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities,
p169
aVwhich you can now find all over the world,
p170
aVcommunities centered around life
p171
aVwith people with mental disabilities \u2014
p172
aVmostly Down syndrome.
p173
aVThe communities that Jean Vanier founded,
p174
aVlike Jean Vanier himself,
p175
aVexude tenderness.
p176
aV"Tender" is another word
p177
aVI would love to spend some time resurrecting.
p178
aVWe spend so much time in this culture
p179
aVbeing driven and aggressive,
p180
aVand I spend a lot of time being those things too.
p181
aVAnd compassion can also have those qualities.
p182
aVBut again and again, lived compassion
p183
aVbrings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.
p184
aVJean Vanier says
p185
aVthat his work,
p186
aVlike the work of other people \u2014
p187
aVhis great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa \u2014
p188
aVis never in the first instance about changing the world;
p189
aVit's in the first instance about changing ourselves.
p190
aVHe's says that what they do with L'Arche
p191
aVis not a solution, but a sign.
p192
aVCompassion is rarely a solution,
p193
aVbut it is always a sign of a deeper reality,
p194
aVof deeper human possibilities.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd compassion is unleashed
p197
aVin wider and wider circles
p198
aVby signs and stories,
p199
aVnever by statistics and strategies.
p200
aVWe need those things too,
p201
aVbut we're also bumping up against their limits.
p202
aVAnd at the same time that we are doing that,
p203
aVI think we are rediscovering the power of story \u2014
p204
aVthat as human beings, we need stories
p205
aVto survive, to flourish,
p206
aVto change.
p207
aVOur traditions have always known this,
p208
aVand that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart
p209
aVand carried them forward in time for us.
p210
aVThere is, of course, a story
p211
aVbehind the key moral longing
p212
aVand commandment of Judaism
p213
aVto repair the world \u2014 tikkun olam.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd I'll never forget hearing that story
p216
aVfrom Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen,
p217
aVwho told it to me as her grandfather told it to her,
p218
aVthat in the beginning of the Creation
p219
aVsomething happened
p220
aVand the original light of the universe
p221
aVwas shattered into countless pieces.
p222
aVIt lodged as shards
p223
aVinside every aspect of the Creation.
p224
aVAnd that the highest human calling
p225
aVis to look for this light, to point at it when we see it,
p226
aVto gather it up,
p227
aVand in so doing, to repair the world.
p228
aVNow this might sound like a fanciful tale.
p229
aVSome of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.
p230
aVRachel Naomi Remen says
p231
aVthis is an important and empowering story
p232
aVfor our time,
p233
aVbecause this story insists
p234
aVthat each and every one of us,
p235
aVfrail and flawed as we may be,
p236
aVinadequate as we may feel,
p237
aVhas exactly what's needed
p238
aVto help repair the part of the world
p239
aVthat we can see and touch.
p240
aa(lp241
VStories like this,
p242
aVsigns like this,
p243
aVare practical tools
p244
aVin a world longing to bring compassion
p245
aVto abundant images of suffering
p246
aVthat can otherwise overwhelm us.
p247
aVRachel Naomi Remen
p248
aVis actually bringing compassion
p249
aVback to its rightful place alongside science
p250
aVin her field of medicine
p251
aVin the training of new doctors.
p252
aVAnd this trend
p253
aVof what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing,
p254
aVhow these kinds of virtues
p255
aVare finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine \u2014
p256
aVthe work Fred Luskin is doing \u2014
p257
aVI think this is one of the most fascinating developments
p258
aVof the 21st century \u2014
p259
aVthat science, in fact,
p260
aVis taking a virtue like compassion
p261
aVdefinitively out of the realm of idealism.
p262
aVThis is going to change science, I believe,
p263
aVand it will change religion.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut here's a face
p266
aVfrom 20th century science
p267
aVthat might surprise you
p268
aVin a discussion about compassion.
p269
aVWe all know about the Albert Einstein
p270
aVwho came up with E = mc2.
p271
aVWe don't hear so much about the Einstein
p272
aVwho invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson,
p273
aVto stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton
p274
aVbecause the best hotel there
p275
aVwas segregated and wouldn't have her.
p276
aVWe don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity
p277
aVto advocate for political prisoners in Europe
p278
aVor the Scottsboro boys
p279
aVin the American South.
p280
aa(lp281
VEinstein believed deeply
p282
aVthat science should transcend
p283
aVnational and ethnic divisions.
p284
aVBut he watched physicists and chemists
p285
aVbecome the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction
p286
aVin the early 20th century.
p287
aVHe once said that science in his generation
p288
aVhad become like a razor blade
p289
aVin the hands of a three-year-old.
p290
aVAnd Einstein foresaw
p291
aVthat as we grow more modern
p292
aVand technologically advanced,
p293
aVwe need the virtues
p294
aVour traditions carry forward in time
p295
aVmore, not less.
p296
aVHe liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.
p297
aVSome of his favorites were Moses,
p298
aVJesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi,
p299
aVGandhi \u2014 he adored his contemporary, Gandhi.
p300
aVAnd Einstein said \u2014
p301
aVand I think this is a quote,
p302
aVagain, that has not been passed down in his legacy \u2014
p303
aVthat "these kinds of people
p304
aVare geniuses in the art of living,
p305
aVmore necessary
p306
aVto the dignity, security and joy of humanity
p307
aVthan the discoverers of objective knowledge."
p308
aa(lp309
VNow invoking Einstein
p310
aVmight not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth
p311
aVand make it seem accessible to all the rest of us,
p312
aVbut actually it is.
p313
aVI want to show you
p314
aVthe rest of this photograph,
p315
aVbecause this photograph
p316
aVis analogous to what we do to the word "compassion" in our culture \u2014
p317
aVwe clean it up
p318
aVand we diminish its depths and its grounding
p319
aVin life, which is messy.
p320
aVSo in this photograph
p321
aVyou see a mind looking out a window
p322
aVat what might be a cathedral \u2014 it's not.
p323
aVThis is the full photograph,
p324
aVand you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket,
p325
aVsmoking a cigar.
p326
aVAnd by the look of that paunch,
p327
aVhe hasn't been doing enough yoga.
p328
aVWe put these two photographs side-by-side on our website,
p329
aVand someone said, "When I look at the first photo,
p330
aVI ask myself, what was he thinking?
p331
aVAnd when I look at the second, I ask,
p332
aVwhat kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?"
p333
aa(lp334
VWell, he was complicated.
p335
aVHe was incredibly compassionate
p336
aVin some of his relationships
p337
aVand terribly inadequate in others.
p338
aVAnd it is much harder, often,
p339
aVto be compassionate towards those closest to us,
p340
aVwhich is another quality in the universe of compassion,
p341
aVon its dark side,
p342
aVthat also deserves our serious attention and illumination.
p343
aVGandhi, too, was a real flawed human being.
p344
aVSo was Martin Luther King, Jr. So was Dorothy Day.
p345
aVSo was Mother Teresa.
p346
aVSo are we all.
p347
aVAnd I want to say
p348
aVthat it is a liberating thing
p349
aVto realize that that is no obstacle to compassion \u2014
p350
aVfollowing on what Fred Luskin says \u2014
p351
aVthat these flaws just make us human.
p352
aa(lp353
VOur culture is obsessed with perfection
p354
aVand with hiding problems.
p355
aVBut what a liberating thing to realize
p356
aVthat our problems, in fact,
p357
aVare probably our richest sources
p358
aVfor rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion,
p359
aVtowards bringing compassion
p360
aVtowards the suffering and joys of others.
p361
aVRachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor
p362
aVbecause of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease.
p363
aVEinstein became a humanitarian,
p364
aVnot because of his exquisite knowledge
p365
aVof space and time and matter,
p366
aVbut because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist.
p367
aVAnd Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say
p368
aVthat it was some of your very wounding experiences
p369
aVin a religious life that,
p370
aVwith a zigzag,
p371
aVhave led to the Charter for Compassion.
p372
aVCompassion can't be reduced to sainthood
p373
aVany more than it can be reduced to pity.
p374
aa(lp375
VSo I want to propose
p376
aVa final definition of compassion \u2014
p377
aVthis is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way \u2014
p378
aVand that would be for us
p379
aVto call compassion a spiritual technology.
p380
aVNow our traditions contain
p381
aVvast wisdom about this,
p382
aVand we need them to mine it for us now.
p383
aVBut compassion is also equally at home
p384
aVin the secular as in the religious.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo I will paraphrase Einstein in closing
p387
aVand say that humanity,
p388
aVthe future of humanity,
p389
aVneeds this technology
p390
aVas much as it needs all the others
p391
aVthat have now connected us
p392
aVand set before us
p393
aVthe terrifying and wondrous possibility
p394
aVof actually becoming one human race.
p395
aa(lp396
VThank you.

She studied history at Brown University and went to Bonn, West Germany in 1983 on a<strong> Fulbright Scholarship to study politics in Cold War Europe. </strong>In her 20s, she ended up in divided Berlin for most of the 1980s, first as The New York Times stringer and a freelance correspondent for Newsweek, The International Herald Tribune, the BBC, and Die Zeit. She later became a special assistant to the U.S. Ambassador to West Germany. <br /><br />When Tippett graduated with a M.Div. from Yale, <strong>she saw a black hole where intelligent coverage of religion should be.</strong> As she conducted a far-flung oral history project for the Benedictines of St. John&#39;s Abbey, she began to imagine radio conversations about the spiritual and intellectual content of faith that could open minds and enrich public life. These imagined conversations became reality when <strong>she created &quot;Speaking of Faith&quot; (now &quot;On Being&quot;),</strong> which is broadcast on over 200 US pubic radio stations and globally by NPR. From ecology to autism to torture, Tippett and her guests reach beyond the headlines to explore meaning, faith and ethics amidst the political, economic, cultural and technological shifts that define 21st century life.

granddaughter of a Southern Baptist preacher. She studied history at Brown University and went to Bonn, West Germany in 1983 on a<strong> Fulbright Scholarship to study politics in Cold War Europe. </strong>In her 20s, she ended up in divided Berlin for most of the 1980s, first as The New York Times stringer and a freelance correspondent for Newsweek, The International Herald Tribune, the BBC, and Die Zeit. She later became a special assistant to the U.S. Ambassador to West Germany. <br /><br />When Tippett graduated with a M.Div. from Yale, <strong>she saw a black hole where intelligent coverage of religion should be.</strong> As she conducted a far-flung oral history project for the Benedictines of St. John&#39;s Abbey, she began to imagine radio conversations about the spiritual and intellectual content of faith that could open minds and enrich public life. These imagined conversations became reality when <strong>she created &quot;Speaking of Faith&quot; (now &quot;On Being&quot;),</strong> which is broadcast on over 200 US pubic radio stations and globally by NPR. From ecology to autism to torture, Tippett and her guests reach beyond the headlines to explore meaning, faith and ethics amidst the political, economic, cultural and technological shifts that define 21st century life.

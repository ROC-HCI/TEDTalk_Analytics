VI have a question:
p5
aVWho here remembers when they first realized
p6
aVthey were going to die?
p7
aa(lp8
VI do. I was a young boy,
p9
aVand my grandfather had just died,
p10
aVand I remember a few days later lying in bed at night
p11
aVtrying to make sense of what had happened.
p12
aVWhat did it mean that he was dead?
p13
aVWhere had he gone?
p14
aVIt was like a hole in reality had opened up
p15
aVand swallowed him.
p16
aVBut then the really shocking question occurred to me:
p17
aVIf he could die, could it happen to me too?
p18
aVCould that hole in reality open up and swallow me?
p19
aVWould it open up beneath my bed
p20
aVand swallow me as I slept?
p21
aVWell, at some point, all children become aware of death.
p22
aVIt can happen in different ways, of course,
p23
aVand usually comes in stages.
p24
aVOur idea of death develops as we grow older.
p25
aVAnd if you reach back into the dark corners
p26
aVof your memory,
p27
aVyou might remember something like what I felt
p28
aVwhen my grandfather died and when I realized
p29
aVit could happen to me too,
p30
aVthat sense that behind all of this
p31
aVthe void is waiting.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd this development in childhood
p34
aVreflects the development of our species.
p35
aVJust as there was a point in your development
p36
aVas a child when your sense of self and of time
p37
aVbecame sophisticated enough
p38
aVfor you to realize you were mortal,
p39
aVso at some point in the evolution of our species,
p40
aVsome early human's sense of self and of time
p41
aVbecame sophisticated enough
p42
aVfor them to become the first human to realize,
p43
aV"I'm going to die."
p44
aVThis is, if you like, our curse.
p45
aVIt's the price we pay for being so damn clever.
p46
aVWe have to live in the knowledge
p47
aVthat the worst thing that can possibly happen
p48
aVone day surely will,
p49
aVthe end of all our projects,
p50
aVour hopes, our dreams, of our individual world.
p51
aVWe each live in the shadow of a personal
p52
aVapocalypse.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd that's frightening. It's terrifying.
p55
aVAnd so we look for a way out.
p56
aVAnd in my case, as I was about five years old,
p57
aVthis meant asking my mum.
p58
aVNow when I first started asking
p59
aVwhat happens when we die,
p60
aVthe grown-ups around me at the time
p61
aVanswered with a typical English mix of awkwardness
p62
aVand half-hearted Christianity,
p63
aVand the phrase I heard most often
p64
aVwas that granddad was now
p65
aV"up there looking down on us,"
p66
aVand if I should die too, which wouldn't happen of course,
p67
aVthen I too would go up there,
p68
aVwhich made death sound a lot like
p69
aVan existential elevator.
p70
aVNow this didn't sound very plausible.
p71
aVI used to watch a children's news program at the time,
p72
aVand this was the era of space exploration.
p73
aVThere were always rockets going up into the sky,
p74
aVup into space, going up there.
p75
aVBut none of the astronauts when they came back
p76
aVever mentioned having met my granddad
p77
aVor any other dead people.
p78
aVBut I was scared,
p79
aVand the idea of taking the existential elevator
p80
aVto see my granddad
p81
aVsounded a lot better than being swallowed
p82
aVby the void while I slept.
p83
aVAnd so I believed it anyway,
p84
aVeven though it didn't make much sense.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd this thought process that I went through
p87
aVas a child, and have been through many times since,
p88
aVincluding as a grown-up,
p89
aVis a product of what psychologists call
p90
aVa bias.
p91
aVNow a bias is a way in which we systematically
p92
aVget things wrong,
p93
aVways in which we miscalculate, misjudge,
p94
aVdistort reality, or see what we want to see,
p95
aVand the bias I'm talking about
p96
aVworks like this:
p97
aVConfront someone with the fact
p98
aVthat they are going to die
p99
aVand they will believe just about any story
p100
aVthat tells them it isn't true
p101
aVand they can, instead, live forever,
p102
aVeven if it means taking the existential elevator.
p103
aVNow we can see this as the biggest bias of all.
p104
aVIt has been demonstrated in over 400
p105
aVempirical studies.
p106
aVNow these studies are ingenious, but they're simple.
p107
aVThey work like this.
p108
aVYou take two groups of people
p109
aVwho are similar in all relevant respects,
p110
aVand you remind one group that they're going to die
p111
aVbut not the other, then you compare their behavior.
p112
aVSo you're observing how it biases behavior
p113
aVwhen people become aware of their mortality.
p114
aVAnd every time, you get the same result:
p115
aVPeople who are made aware of their mortality
p116
aVare more willing to believe stories
p117
aVthat tell them they can escape death
p118
aVand live forever.
p119
aVSo here's an example: One recent study
p120
aVtook two groups of agnostics,
p121
aVthat is people who are undecided
p122
aVin their religious beliefs.
p123
aVNow, one group was asked to think about being dead.
p124
aVThe other group was asked to think about
p125
aVbeing lonely.
p126
aVThey were then asked again about their religious beliefs.
p127
aVThose who had been asked to think about being dead
p128
aVwere afterwards twice as likely to express faith
p129
aVin God and Jesus.
p130
aVTwice as likely.
p131
aVEven though the before they were all equally agnostic.
p132
aVBut put the fear of death in them,
p133
aVand they run to Jesus.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, this shows that reminding people of death
p136
aVbiases them to believe, regardless of the evidence,
p137
aVand it works not just for religion,
p138
aVbut for any kind of belief system
p139
aVthat promises immortality in some form,
p140
aVwhether it's becoming famous
p141
aVor having children
p142
aVor even nationalism,
p143
aVwhich promises you can live on as part of a greater whole.
p144
aVThis is a bias that has shaped
p145
aVthe course of human history.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, the theory behind this bias
p148
aVin the over 400 studies
p149
aVis called terror management theory,
p150
aVand the idea is simple. It's just this.
p151
aVWe develop our worldviews,
p152
aVthat is, the stories we tell ourselves
p153
aVabout the world and our place in it,
p154
aVin order to help us manage
p155
aVthe terror of death.
p156
aVAnd these immortality stories
p157
aVhave thousands of different manifestations,
p158
aVbut I believe that behind the apparent diversity
p159
aVthere are actually just four basic forms
p160
aVthat these immortality stories can take.
p161
aVAnd we can see them repeating themselves
p162
aVthroughout history, just with slight variations
p163
aVto reflect the vocabulary of the day.
p164
aVNow I'm going to briefly introduce these four
p165
aVbasic forms of immortality story,
p166
aVand I want to try to give you some sense
p167
aVof the way in which they're retold by each culture
p168
aVor generation
p169
aVusing the vocabulary of their day.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, the first story is the simplest.
p172
aVWe want to avoid death,
p173
aVand the dream of doing that in this body
p174
aVin this world forever
p175
aVis the first and simplest kind of immortality story,
p176
aVand it might at first sound implausible,
p177
aVbut actually, almost every culture in human history
p178
aVhas had some myth or legend
p179
aVof an elixir of life or a fountain of youth
p180
aVor something that promises to keep us going
p181
aVforever.
p182
aVAncient Egypt had such myths,
p183
aVancient Babylon, ancient India.
p184
aVThroughout European history, we find them in the work of the alchemists,
p185
aVand of course we still believe this today,
p186
aVonly we tell this story using the vocabulary
p187
aVof science.
p188
aVSo 100 years ago,
p189
aVhormones had just been discovered,
p190
aVand people hoped that hormone treatments
p191
aVwere going to cure aging and disease,
p192
aVand now instead we set our hopes on stem cells,
p193
aVgenetic engineering, and nanotechnology.
p194
aVBut the idea that science can cure death
p195
aVis just one more chapter in the story
p196
aVof the magical elixir,
p197
aVa story that is as old as civilization.
p198
aVBut betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir
p199
aVand staying alive forever
p200
aVis a risky strategy.
p201
aVWhen we look back through history
p202
aVat all those who have sought an elixir in the past,
p203
aVthe one thing they now have in common
p204
aVis that they're all dead.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo we need a backup plan, and exactly this kind of plan B
p207
aVis what the second kind of immortality story offers,
p208
aVand that's resurrection.
p209
aVAnd it stays with the idea that I am this body,
p210
aVI am this physical organism.
p211
aVIt accepts that I'm going to have to die
p212
aVbut says, despite that,
p213
aVI can rise up and I can live again.
p214
aVIn other words, I can do what Jesus did.
p215
aVJesus died, he was three days in the [tomb],
p216
aVand then he rose up and lived again.
p217
aVAnd the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again
p218
aVis orthodox believe, not just for Christians
p219
aVbut also Jews and Muslims.
p220
aVBut our desire to believe this story
p221
aVis so deeply embedded
p222
aVthat we are reinventing it again
p223
aVfor the scientific age,
p224
aVfor example, with the idea of cryonics.
p225
aVThat's the idea that when you die,
p226
aVyou can have yourself frozen,
p227
aVand then, at some point when technology
p228
aVhas advanced enough,
p229
aVyou can be thawed out and repaired and revived
p230
aVand so resurrected.
p231
aVAnd so some people believe an omnipotent god
p232
aVwill resurrect them to live again,
p233
aVand other people believe an  omnipotent scientist will do it.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut for others, the whole idea of resurrection,
p236
aVof climbing out of the grave,
p237
aVit's just too much like a bad zombie movie.
p238
aVThey find the body too messy, too unreliable
p239
aVto guarantee eternal life,
p240
aVand so they set their hopes on the third,
p241
aVmore spiritual immortality story,
p242
aVthe idea that we can leave our body behind
p243
aVand live on as a soul.
p244
aVNow, the majority of people on Earth
p245
aVbelieve they have a soul,
p246
aVand the idea is central to many religions.
p247
aVBut even though, in its current form,
p248
aVin its traditional form,
p249
aVthe idea of the soul is still hugely popular,
p250
aVnonetheless we are again
p251
aVreinventing it for the digital age,
p252
aVfor example with the idea
p253
aVthat you can leave your body behind
p254
aVby uploading your mind, your essence,
p255
aVthe real you, onto a computer,
p256
aVand so live on as an avatar in the ether.
p257
aa(lp258
VBut of course there are skeptics who say
p259
aVif we look at the evidence of science,
p260
aVparticularly neuroscience,
p261
aVit suggests that your mind,
p262
aVyour essence, the real you,
p263
aVis very much dependent on a particular part
p264
aVof your body, that is, your brain.
p265
aVAnd such skeptics can find comfort
p266
aVin the fourth kind of immortality story,
p267
aVand that is legacy,
p268
aVthe idea that you can live on
p269
aVthrough the echo you leave in the world,
p270
aVlike the great Greek warrior Achilles,
p271
aVwho sacrificed his life fighting at Troy
p272
aVso that he might win immortal fame.
p273
aVAnd the pursuit of fame is as widespread
p274
aVand popular now as it ever was,
p275
aVand in our digital age,
p276
aVit's even easier to achieve.
p277
aVYou don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles
p278
aVor a great king or hero.
p279
aVAll you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat. (Laughter)
p280
aVBut some people prefer to leave a more tangible,
p281
aVbiological legacy \u2014 children, for example.
p282
aVOr they like, they hope, to live on
p283
aVas part of some greater whole,
p284
aVa nation or a family or a tribe,
p285
aVtheir gene pool.
p286
aVBut again, there are skeptics
p287
aVwho doubt whether legacy
p288
aVreally is immortality.
p289
aVWoody Allen, for example, who said,
p290
aV"I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen.
p291
aVI want to live on in my apartment."
p292
aa(lp293
VSo those are the four
p294
aVbasic kinds of immortality stories,
p295
aVand I've tried to give just some sense
p296
aVof how they're retold by each generation
p297
aVwith just slight variations
p298
aVto fit the fashions of the day.
p299
aVAnd the fact that they recur in this way,
p300
aVin such a similar form but in such different belief systems,
p301
aVsuggests, I think,
p302
aVthat we should be skeptical of the truth
p303
aVof any particular version of these stories.
p304
aVThe fact that some people believe
p305
aVan omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again
p306
aVand others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it
p307
aVsuggests that neither are really believing this
p308
aVon the strength of the evidence.
p309
aVRather, we believe these stories
p310
aVbecause we are biased to believe them,
p311
aVand we are biased to believe them
p312
aVbecause we are so afraid of death.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo the question is,
p315
aVare we doomed to lead the one life we have
p316
aVin a way that is shaped by fear and denial,
p317
aVor can we overcome this bias?
p318
aVWell the Greek philosopher Epicurus
p319
aVthought we could.
p320
aVHe argued that the fear of death is natural,
p321
aVbut it is not rational.
p322
aV"Death," he said, "is nothing to us,
p323
aVbecause when we are here, death is not,
p324
aVand when death is here, we are gone."
p325
aVNow this is often quoted, but it's difficult
p326
aVto really grasp, to really internalize,
p327
aVbecause exactly this idea of being gone
p328
aVis so difficult to imagine.
p329
aVSo 2,000 years later, another philosopher,
p330
aVLudwig Wittgenstein, put it like this:
p331
aV"Death is not an event in life:
p332
aVWe do not live to experience death.
p333
aVAnd so," he added,
p334
aV"in this sense, life has no end."
p335
aa(lp336
VSo it was natural for me as a child
p337
aVto fear being swallowed by the void,
p338
aVbut it wasn't rational,
p339
aVbecause being swallowed by the void
p340
aVis not something that any of us
p341
aVwill ever live to experience.
p342
aa(lp343
VNow, overcoming this bias is not easy because
p344
aVthe fear of death is so deeply embedded in us,
p345
aVyet when we see that the fear itself is not rational,
p346
aVand when we bring out into the open
p347
aVthe ways in which it can unconsciously bias us,
p348
aVthen we can at least start
p349
aVto try to minimize the influence it has
p350
aVon our lives.
p351
aa(lp352
VNow, I find it helps to see life
p353
aVas being like a book:
p354
aVJust as a book is bounded by its covers,
p355
aVby beginning and end,
p356
aVso our lives are bounded by birth and death,
p357
aVand even though a book is limited by beginning and end,
p358
aVit can encompass distant landscapes,
p359
aVexotic figures, fantastic adventures.
p360
aVAnd even though a book is limited by beginning and end,
p361
aVthe characters within it
p362
aVknow no horizons.
p363
aVThey only know the moments that make up their story,
p364
aVeven when the book is closed.
p365
aVAnd so the characters of a book
p366
aVare not afraid of reaching the last page.
p367
aVLong John Silver is not afraid of you
p368
aVfinishing your copy of "Treasure Island."
p369
aVAnd so it should be with us.
p370
aVImagine the book of your life,
p371
aVits covers, its beginning and end, and your birth and your death.
p372
aVYou can only know the moments in between,
p373
aVthe moments that make up your life.
p374
aVIt makes no sense for you to fear
p375
aVwhat is outside of those covers,
p376
aVwhether before your birth
p377
aVor after your death.
p378
aVAnd you needn't worry how long the book is,
p379
aVor whether it's a comic strip or an epic.
p380
aVThe only thing that matters
p381
aVis that you make it a good story.
p382
aa(lp383
VThank you.

VSo this is a story
p5
aVof a place that I now call home.
p6
aVIt's a story of public education
p7
aVand of rural communities
p8
aVand of what design might do to improve both.
p9
aVSo this is Bertie County,
p10
aVNorth Carolina, USA.
p11
aVTo give you an idea of the "where:"
p12
aVSo here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in,
p13
aVBertie County is in the eastern part of the state.
p14
aVIt's about two hours east
p15
aVdriving-time from Raleigh.
p16
aVAnd it's very flat. It's very swampy.
p17
aVIt's mostly farmland.
p18
aVThe entire county
p19
aVis home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed.
p20
aVSo there's only 27 people per square mile,
p21
aVwhich comes down to about 10 people
p22
aVper square kilometer.
p23
aa(lp24
VBertie County is kind of a prime example
p25
aVin the demise of rural America.
p26
aVWe've seen this story all over the country
p27
aVand even in places beyond the American borders.
p28
aVWe know the symptoms.
p29
aVIt's the hollowing out of small towns.
p30
aVIt's downtowns becoming ghost towns.
p31
aVThe brain drain \u2014
p32
aVwhere all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.
p33
aVIt's the dependence on farm subsidies
p34
aVand under-performing schools
p35
aVand higher poverty rates in rural areas
p36
aVthan in urban.
p37
aVAnd Bertie County is no exception to this.
p38
aVPerhaps the biggest thing it struggles with,
p39
aVlike many communities similar to it,
p40
aVis that there's no
p41
aVshared, collective investment
p42
aVin the future of rural communities.
p43
aVOnly 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now
p44
aVbenefits rural communities,
p45
aVand yet 20 percent of our population lives there.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor.
p48
aVIt is the poorest county in the state.
p49
aVIt has one in three of its children living in poverty,
p50
aVand it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto."
p51
aVThe economy is mostly agricultural.
p52
aVThe biggest crops are cotton and tobacco,
p53
aVand we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut.
p54
aVThe biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.
p55
aVThe county seat is Windsor.
p56
aVThis is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now.
p57
aVIt's home to only 2,000 people,
p58
aVand like a lot of other small towns
p59
aVit has been hollowed out over the years.
p60
aVThere are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair
p61
aVthan occupied and in use.
p62
aVYou can count the number of restaurants in the county
p63
aVon one hand \u2014
p64
aVBunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.
p65
aVBut in the whole county there is no coffee shop,
p66
aVthere's no Internet cafe,
p67
aVthere's no movie theater, there's no bookstore.
p68
aVThere isn't even a Walmart.
p69
aa(lp70
VRacially, the county
p71
aVis about 60 percent African-American,
p72
aVbut what happens in the public schools
p73
aVis most of the privileged white kids
p74
aVgo to the private Lawrence Academy.
p75
aVSo the public school students
p76
aVare about 86 percent African-American.
p77
aVAnd this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class,
p78
aVand you can see the difference is pretty stark.
p79
aVSo to say that the public education system
p80
aVin Bertie County is struggling
p81
aVwould be a huge understatement.
p82
aVThere's basically no pool
p83
aVof qualified teachers to pull from,
p84
aVand only eight percent of the people in the county
p85
aVhave a bachelor's degree or higher.
p86
aVSo there isn't a big legacy
p87
aVin the pride of education.
p88
aVIn fact, two years ago,
p89
aVonly 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders
p90
aVwere passing the state standard
p91
aVin both English and math.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place,
p94
aVbut I promise there is good news.
p95
aVThe biggest asset, in my opinion,
p96
aVone of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man:
p97
aVThis is Dr. Chip Zullinger,
p98
aVfondly known as Dr. Z.
p99
aVHe was brought in in October 2007
p100
aVas the new superintendent
p101
aVto basically fix this broken school system.
p102
aVAnd he previously was a superintendent
p103
aVin Charleston, South Carolina
p104
aVand then in Denver, Colorado.
p105
aVHe started some of the country's first charter schools
p106
aVin the late '80s in the U.S.
p107
aVAnd he is an absolute renegade and a visionary,
p108
aVand he is the reason that I now live and work there.
p109
aVSo in February of 2009,
p110
aVDr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design \u2014
p111
aVwhich is a non-profit design firm that I founded \u2014
p112
aVto come to Bertie and to partner with him
p113
aVon the repair of this school district
p114
aVand to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district.
p115
aVAnd he invited us in particular
p116
aVbecause we have a very specific
p117
aVtype of design process \u2014
p118
aVone that results in appropriate design solutions
p119
aVin places that don't usually have access
p120
aVto design services or creative capital.
p121
aVSpecifically, we use these six design directives,
p122
aVprobably the most important being number two:
p123
aVwe design with, not for \u2014
p124
aVin that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design,
p125
aVit's not about designing for clients anymore.
p126
aVIt's about designing with people,
p127
aVand letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo at the time of being invited down there,
p130
aVwe were based in San Francisco,
p131
aVand so we were going back and forth
p132
aVfor basically the rest of 2009,
p133
aVspending about half our time in Bertie County.
p134
aVAnd when I say we, I mean Project H,
p135
aVbut more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller,
p136
aVwho's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder.
p137
aVSo fast-forward to today, and we now live there.
p138
aVI have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo,
p139
aVbecause he would kill me if he knew I was using it
p140
aVbecause of the sweatsuits.
p141
aVBut this is our front porch. We live there.
p142
aVWe now call this place home.
p143
aVOver the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth,
p144
aVwe realized we had fallen in love with the place.
p145
aVWe had fallen in love with the place and the people
p146
aVand the work that we're able to do
p147
aVin a rural place like Bertie County,
p148
aVthat, as designers and builders,
p149
aVyou can't do everywhere.
p150
aVThere's space to experiment
p151
aVand to weld and to test things.
p152
aVWe have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger.
p153
aVThere's a nobility of real, hands-on,
p154
aVdirt-under-your-fingernails work.
p155
aa(lp156
VBut beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there,
p157
aVthere is a huge need.
p158
aVThere is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County.
p159
aVThere isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.
p160
aVAnd so we saw an opportunity
p161
aVto bring design as this untouched tool,
p162
aVsomething that Bertie County didn't otherwise have,
p163
aVand to be sort of the \u2014 to usher that in
p164
aVas a new type of tool in their tool kit.
p165
aVThe initial goal became using design
p166
aVwithin the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger \u2014
p167
aVthat was why we were there.
p168
aVBut beyond that, we recognized
p169
aVthat Bertie County, as a community,
p170
aVwas in dire need of a fresh perspective
p171
aVof pride and connectedness
p172
aVand of the creative capital
p173
aVthat they were so much lacking.
p174
aVSo the goal became, yes, to apply design within education,
p175
aVbut then to figure out how to make education
p176
aVa great vehicle for community development.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches
p179
aVto the intersection of design and education.
p180
aVAnd I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County,
p181
aVbut I feel pretty confident that they could work
p182
aVin a lot of other rural communities
p183
aVaround the U.S. and maybe even beyond.
p184
aVSo the first of the three is design for education.
p185
aVThis is the most kind of direct, obvious
p186
aVintersection of the two things.
p187
aVIt's the physical construction
p188
aVof improved spaces and materials and experiences
p189
aVfor teachers and students.
p190
aVThis is in response to the awful mobile trailers
p191
aVand the outdated textbooks
p192
aVand the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days.
p193
aVAnd so this played out for us in a couple different ways.
p194
aVThe first was a series of renovations of computer labs.
p195
aVSo traditionally, the computer labs,
p196
aVparticularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County,
p197
aVwhere they have to benchmark test every other week,
p198
aVthe computer lab is a kill-and-drill
p199
aVtesting facility.
p200
aVYou come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave.
p201
aVSo we wanted to change the way that students approach technology,
p202
aVto create a more convivial and social space
p203
aVthat was more engaging, more accessible,
p204
aVand also to increase the ability for teachers
p205
aVto use these spaces for technology-based instruction.
p206
aVSo this is the lab at the high school,
p207
aVand the principal there is in love with this room.
p208
aVEvery time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd this also meant the co-creation with some teachers
p211
aVof this educational playground system
p212
aVcalled the learning landscape.
p213
aVIt allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects
p214
aVthrough game play and activity
p215
aVand running around and screaming and being a kid.
p216
aVSo this game that the kids are playing here \u2014
p217
aVin this case they were learning basic multiplication
p218
aVthrough a game called Match Me.
p219
aVAnd in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams,
p220
aVone team on each side of the playground,
p221
aVand the teacher will take a piece of chalk
p222
aVand just write a number on each of the tires.
p223
aVAnd then she'll call out a math problem \u2014
p224
aVso let's say four times four \u2014
p225
aVand then one student from each team has to compete
p226
aVto figure out that four times four is 16
p227
aVand find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.
p228
aVSo the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires
p229
aVand then your team wins.
p230
aVAnd the impact of the learning landscape
p231
aVhas been pretty surprising and amazing.
p232
aVSome of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores,
p233
aVa greater comfort level with the material,
p234
aVespecially with the boys,
p235
aVthat in going outside and playing,
p236
aVthey aren't afraid to take on
p237
aVa double-digit multiplication problem \u2014
p238
aVand also that the teachers are able
p239
aVto use these as assessment tools
p240
aVto better gauge how their students
p241
aVare understanding new material.
p242
aVSo with design for education, I think the most important thing
p243
aVis to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers,
p244
aVso that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.
p245
aVSo this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent.
p246
aVHe came out for one of our teacher-training days
p247
aVand won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VSo the second approach is redesigning education itself.
p252
aVThis is the most complex.
p253
aVIt's a systems-level look
p254
aVat how education is administered
p255
aVand what is being offered and to whom.
p256
aVSo in many cases this is not so much about making change
p257
aVas it is creating the conditions
p258
aVunder which change is possible
p259
aVand the incentive to want to make change,
p260
aVwhich is easier said than done in rural communities
p261
aVand in inside-the-box education systems
p262
aVin rural communities.
p263
aVSo for us, this was a graphic public campaign
p264
aVcalled Connect Bertie.
p265
aVThere are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.
p266
aVAnd this was for a fund that the school district had
p267
aVto put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection
p268
aVin every home
p269
aVwith a child in the public school system.
p270
aVRight now I should say,
p271
aVthere are only 10 percent of the houses
p272
aVthat actually have an in-home Internet connection.
p273
aVAnd the only places to get WiFi
p274
aVare in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint,
p275
aVwhich I find myself squatting outside of a lot.
p276
aVAside from, you know, getting people excited
p277
aVand wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place,
p278
aVit asked the school system
p279
aVto envision how it might become a catalyst
p280
aVfor a more connected community.
p281
aVIt asked them to reach outside of the school walls
p282
aVand to think about how they could play a role
p283
aVin the community's development.
p284
aVSo the first batch of computers
p285
aVare being installed later this summer,
p286
aVand we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies
p287
aVaround how we might connect the classroom and the home
p288
aVto extend learning beyond the school day.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about,
p291
aVwhich is where we are now,
p292
aVis: design as education.
p293
aVSo "design as education" means
p294
aVthat we could actually teach design within public schools,
p295
aVand not design-based learning \u2014
p296
aVnot like "let's learn physics by building a rocket,"
p297
aVbut actually learning design-thinking
p298
aVcoupled with real construction and fabrication skills
p299
aVput towards a local community purpose.
p300
aVIt also means that designers are no longer consultants,
p301
aVbut we're teachers,
p302
aVand we are charged with growing creative capital
p303
aVwithin the next generation.
p304
aVAnd what design offers as an educational framework
p305
aVis an antidote
p306
aVto all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction
p307
aVthat so many of these school districts are plagued by.
p308
aVIt's hands-on, it's in-your-face,
p309
aVit requires an active engagement,
p310
aVand it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning
p311
aVin real ways.
p312
aVSo we started thinking
p313
aVabout the legacy of shop class
p314
aVand how shop class \u2014 wood and metal shop class in particular \u2014
p315
aVhistorically, has been something
p316
aVintended for kids who aren't going to go to college.
p317
aVIt's a vocational training path.
p318
aVIt's working-class; it's blue-collar.
p319
aVThe projects are things like,
p320
aVlet's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas.
p321
aVAnd in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class
p322
aVhas gone away entirely.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo we thought, what if you could bring back shop class,
p325
aVbut this time orient the projects
p326
aVaround things that the community needed,
p327
aVand to infuse shop class
p328
aVwith a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process.
p329
aVSo we took this kind of nebulous idea
p330
aVand have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year
p331
aVon writing this as a one-year curriculum
p332
aVoffered at the high school level to the junior class.
p333
aVAnd so this starts in four weeks,
p334
aVat the end of the summer,
p335
aVand my partner and I, Matthew and I,
p336
aVjust went through the arduous and totally convoluted process
p337
aVof getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it.
p338
aVAnd this is what it looks like.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo over the course of two semesters,
p341
aVthe Fall and the Spring,
p342
aVthe students spend three hours a day every single day
p343
aVin our 4,500 square foot
p344
aVstudio/shop space.
p345
aVAnd during that time, they're doing everything
p346
aVfrom going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding,
p347
aVcoming back into the studio,
p348
aVdoing the brainstorming and design visualization
p349
aVto come up with concepts that might work,
p350
aVand then moving into the shop and actually testing them,
p351
aVbuilding them, prototyping them,
p352
aVfiguring out if they are going to work and refining that.
p353
aVAnd then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.
p354
aVThey're paid as employees of Project H
p355
aVto be the construction crew with us
p356
aVto build these projects in the community.
p357
aVSo the first project, which will be built next summer,
p358
aVis an open-air farmers' market downtown,
p359
aVfollowed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year
p360
aVand home improvements for the elderly in the third year.
p361
aVSo these are real visible projects
p362
aVthat hopefully the students can point to and say,
p363
aV"I built that, and I'm proud of it."
p364
aa(lp365
VSo I want you to meet three of our students.
p366
aVThis is Ryan.
p367
aVShe is 15 years old.
p368
aVShe loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher.
p369
aVShe wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County,
p370
aVbecause that's where her family is from, where she calls home,
p371
aVand she feels very strongly about giving back
p372
aVto this place that she's been fairly fortunate in.
p373
aVSo what Studio H might offer her
p374
aVis a way to develop skills
p375
aVso that she might give back in the most meaningful way.
p376
aa(lp377
VThis is Eric. He plays for the football team.
p378
aVHe is really into dirtbike racing,
p379
aVand he wants to be an architect.
p380
aVSo for him, Studio H offers him
p381
aVa way to develop the skills he will need as an architect,
p382
aVeverything from drafting to wood and metal construction
p383
aVto how to do research for a client.
p384
aa(lp385
VAnd then this is Anthony.
p386
aVHe is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside
p387
aVand doing anything with his hands,
p388
aVand so for him, Studio H means
p389
aVthat he can stay interested in his education
p390
aVthrough that hands-on engagement.
p391
aVHe's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure,
p392
aVso if he ends up not going to college,
p393
aVhe will have developed some industry-relevant skills.
p394
aa(lp395
VWhat design and building really offers to public education
p396
aVis a different kind of classroom.
p397
aVSo this building downtown,
p398
aVwhich may very well become the site of our future farmers' market,
p399
aVis now the classroom.
p400
aVAnd going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors
p401
aVabout what kind of food they buy
p402
aVand from where and why \u2014
p403
aVthat's a homework assignment.
p404
aVAnd the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer
p405
aVwhen they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public \u2014
p406
aVthat's the final exam.
p407
aVAnd for the community, what design and building offers
p408
aVis real, visible, built progress.
p409
aVIt's one project per year,
p410
aVand it makes the youth the biggest asset
p411
aVand the biggest untapped resource
p412
aVin imagining a new future.
p413
aa(lp414
VSo we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year,
p415
aVis a small story \u2014
p416
aV13 students, it's two teachers,
p417
aVit's one project in one place.
p418
aVBut we feel like this could work in other places.
p419
aVAnd I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story,
p420
aVbecause it is so difficult
p421
aVto do humanitarian work at a global scale.
p422
aVBecause, when you zoom out that far,
p423
aVyou lose the ability to view people as humans.
p424
aa(lp425
VUltimately, design itself is a process
p426
aVof constant education
p427
aVfor the people that we work with and for
p428
aVand for us as designers.
p429
aVAnd let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves.
p430
aVWe need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter,
p431
aVwe need to work outside of our comfort zones more,
p432
aVand we need to be better citizens in our own backyard.
p433
aVSo while this is a very small story,
p434
aVwe hope that it represents a step in the right direction
p435
aVfor the future of rural communities
p436
aVand for the future of public education
p437
aVand hopefully also for the future of design.
p438
aa(lp439
VThank you.

VI'm an artist and I cut books.
p5
aVThis is one of my first book works.
p6
aVIt's called "Alternate Route to Knowledge."
p7
aVI wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery
p8
aVand think they're just looking at a regular stack of books,
p9
aVbut then as they got closer they would see this rough hole carved into it,
p10
aVand wonder what was happening, wonder why,
p11
aVand think about the material of the book.
p12
aVSo I'm interested in the texture,
p13
aVbut I'm more interested in the text and the images that we find within books.
p14
aa(lp15
VIn most of my work, what I do is I seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish
p16
aVso it's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book
p17
aVso it becomes a solid material, but then the pages inside are still loose,
p18
aVand then I carve into the surface of the book,
p19
aVand I'm not moving or adding anything.
p20
aVI'm just carving around whatever I find interesting.
p21
aVSo everything you see within the finished piece
p22
aVis exactly where it was in the book before I began.
p23
aa(lp24
VI think of my work as sort of a remix, in a way,
p25
aVbecause I'm working with somebody else's material
p26
aVin the same way that a D.J. might be working with somebody else's music.
p27
aVThis was a book of Raphael paintings, the Renaissance artist,
p28
aVand by taking his work and remixing it, carving into it,
p29
aVI'm sort of making it into something that's more new and more contemporary.
p30
aVI'm thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book
p31
aVand pushing that linear format,
p32
aVand try to push the structure of the book itself
p33
aVso that the book can become fully sculptural.
p34
aa(lp35
VI'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials, weights,
p36
aVin order to hold things  in place before I varnish
p37
aVso that I can push the form  before I begin,
p38
aVso that something like this can become a piece like this,
p39
aVwhich is just made from a single dictionary.
p40
aVOr something like this can become a piece like this.
p41
aVOr something like this,
p42
aVwhich who knows what that's going to be or why that's in my studio,
p43
aVwill become a piece like this.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I think one of the reasons people are disturbed by destroying books,
p46
aVpeople don't want to rip books
p47
aVand nobody really wants to throw away a book,
p48
aVis that we think about books as living things,
p49
aVwe think about them as a body,
p50
aVand they're created to relate to our body, as far as scale,
p51
aVbut they also have the potential to continue to grow
p52
aVand to continue to become new things.
p53
aVSo books really are alive.
p54
aVSo I think of the book as a body,
p55
aVand I think of the book as a technology.
p56
aVI think of the book as a tool.
p57
aVAnd I also think of the book as a machine.
p58
aVI also think of the book as a landscape.
p59
aVThis is a full set of encyclopedias that's been connected and sanded together,
p60
aVand as I carve through it,
p61
aVI'm deciding what I want to choose.
p62
aVSo with encyclopedias, I could have chosen anything,
p63
aVbut I specifically chose images of landscapes.
p64
aVAnd with the material itself, I'm using sandpaper
p65
aVand sanding the edges so not only the images suggest landscape,
p66
aVbut the material itself suggests a landscape as well.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo one of the things I do is when I'm carving through the book,
p69
aVI'm thinking about images, but I'm also thinking about text,
p70
aVand I think about them in a very similar way,
p71
aVbecause what's interesting is that when we're reading text,
p72
aVwhen we're reading a book,
p73
aVit puts images in our head,
p74
aVso we're sort of filling that piece.
p75
aVWe're sort of creating images when we're reading text,
p76
aVand when we're looking at an image, we actually use language
p77
aVin order to understand what we're looking at.
p78
aVSo there's sort of a yin-yang that happens,
p79
aVsort of a flip flop.
p80
aVSo I'm creating a piece that the viewer is completing themselves.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd I think of my work as almost an archaeology.
p83
aVI'm excavating and I'm trying to maximize the potential
p84
aVand discover as much as I possibly can
p85
aVand exposing it within my own work.
p86
aVBut at the same time,
p87
aVI'm thinking about this idea of erasure,
p88
aVand what's happening now that most of our information is intangible,
p89
aVand this idea of loss,
p90
aVand this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers,
p91
aVbut the information itself,
p92
aVnow that we don't have a physical backup,
p93
aVhas to be constantly updated in order to not lose it.
p94
aVAnd I have several dictionaries in my own studio,
p95
aVand I do use a computer every day,
p96
aVand if I need to look up a word, I'll go on the computer,
p97
aVbecause I can go directly and instantly to what I'm looking up.
p98
aVI think that the book was never really
p99
aVthe right format for nonlinear information,
p100
aVwhich is why we're seeing reference books
p101
aVbecoming the first to be  endangered or extinct.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo I don't think that the book will ever really die.
p104
aVPeople think that now that we have digital technology,
p105
aVthe book is going to die,
p106
aVand we are seeing things shifting and things evolving.
p107
aVI think that the book will evolve,
p108
aVand just like people said painting would die
p109
aVwhen photography and printmaking became everyday materials,
p110
aVbut what it really allowed painting to do
p111
aVwas it allowed painting to quit its day job.
p112
aVIt allowed painting to not have to have that everyday chore of telling the story,
p113
aVand painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story,
p114
aVand that's when we saw Modernism emerge,
p115
aVand we saw painting go into different branches.
p116
aVAnd I think that's what's happening with books now,
p117
aVnow that most of our technology, most of our information,
p118
aVmost of our personal and cultural  records are in digital form,
p119
aVI think it's really allowing the book to become something new.
p120
aVSo I think it's a very exciting time for an artist like me,
p121
aVand it's very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future.
p122
aa(lp123
VThank you.

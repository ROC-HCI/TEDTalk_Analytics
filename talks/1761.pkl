VI'd like to talk to you today
p5
aVabout a whole new way to think about sexual activity
p6
aVand sexuality education, by comparison.
p7
aVIf you talk to someone today in America
p8
aVabout sexual activity,
p9
aVyou'll find pretty soon you're not just talking
p10
aVabout sexual activity.
p11
aVYou're also talking about baseball.
p12
aVBecause baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor
p13
aVthat Americans use to think about
p14
aVand talk about sexual activity,
p15
aVand we know that because there's
p16
aVall this language in English
p17
aVthat seems to be talking about baseball
p18
aVbut that's really talking about sexual activity.
p19
aVSo, for example, you can be a pitcher or a catcher,
p20
aVand that corresponds to whether you
p21
aVperform a sexual act or receive a sexual act.
p22
aVOf course, there are the bases,
p23
aVwhich refer to specific sexual activities
p24
aVthat happen in a very specific order,
p25
aVultimately resulting in scoring a run
p26
aVor hitting a home run,
p27
aVwhich is usually having vaginal intercourse
p28
aVto the point of orgasm,
p29
aVat least for the guy.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVYou can strike out, which means
p32
aVyou don't get to have any sexual activity.
p33
aVAnd if you're a benchwarmer,
p34
aVyou might be a virgin or somebody who for
p35
aVwhatever reason isn't in the game,
p36
aVmaybe because of your age or because of your ability
p37
aVor because of your skillset.
p38
aVA bat's a penis,
p39
aVand a nappy dugout is a vulva, or a vagina.
p40
aVA glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom.
p41
aVA switch-hitter is a bisexual person,
p42
aVand we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team.
p43
aVAnd then there's this one:
p44
aV"if there's grass on the field, play ball."
p45
aVAnd that usually refers to
p46
aVif a young person, specifically often a young woman,
p47
aVis old enough to have pubic hair,
p48
aVshe's old enough to have sex with.
p49
aVThis baseball model is incredibly problematic.
p50
aVIt's sexist. It's heterosexist.
p51
aVIt's competitive. It's goal-directed.
p52
aVAnd it can't result in healthy sexuality
p53
aVdeveloping in young people or in adults.
p54
aVSo we need a new model.
p55
aVI'm here today to offer you that new model.
p56
aVAnd it's based on
p57
aVpizza.
p58
aVNow pizza is something that is universally understood
p59
aVand that most people associate with a positive experience.
p60
aVSo let's do this.
p61
aVLet's take baseball and pizza and compare it
p62
aVwhen talking about three aspects of sexual activity:
p63
aVthe trigger for sexual activity,
p64
aVwhat happens during sexual activity,
p65
aVand the expected outcome of sexual activity.
p66
aVSo when do you play baseball?
p67
aVYou play baseball when it's baseball season
p68
aVand when there's a game on the schedule.
p69
aVIt's not exactly your choice.
p70
aVSo if it's prom night or a wedding night
p71
aVor at a party or if our parents aren't home,
p72
aVhey, it's just batter up.
p73
aVCan you imagine saying to your coach,
p74
aV"Uh, I'm not really feeling it today,
p75
aVI think I'll sit this game out."
p76
aVThat's just not the way it happens.
p77
aVAnd when you get together to play baseball,
p78
aVimmediately you're with two opposing teams,
p79
aVone playing offense, one playing defense,
p80
aVsomebody's trying to move deeper into the field.
p81
aVThat's usually a sign to the boy.
p82
aVSomebody's trying to defend people moving into the field.
p83
aVThat's often given to the girl.
p84
aVIt's competitive.
p85
aVWe're not playing with each other.
p86
aVWe're playing against each other.
p87
aVAnd when you show up to play baseball,
p88
aVnobody needs to talk about what we're going to do
p89
aVor how this baseball game might be good for us.
p90
aVEverybody knows the rules.
p91
aVYou just take your position and play the game.
p92
aVBut when do you have pizza?
p93
aVWell, you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza.
p94
aVIt starts with an internal sense, an internal desire, or a need.
p95
aV"Huh. I could go for some pizza."
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVAnd because it's an internal desire,
p98
aVwe actually have some sense of control over that.
p99
aVI could decide that I'm hungry
p100
aVbut know that it's not a great time to eat.
p101
aVAnd then when we get together with someone for pizza,
p102
aVwe're not competing with them,
p103
aVwe're looking for an experience
p104
aVthat both of us will share
p105
aVthat's satisfying for both of us,
p106
aVand when you get together for pizza with somebody,
p107
aVwhat's the first thing you do?
p108
aVYou talk about it.
p109
aVYou talk about what you want.
p110
aVYou talk about what you like.
p111
aVYou may even negotiate it.
p112
aV"How do you feel about pepperoni?" (Laughter)
p113
aV"Not so much, I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself."
p114
aV"Well, maybe we can go half and half."
p115
aVAnd even if you've had pizza with somebody
p116
aVfor a very long time,
p117
aVdon't you still say things like,
p118
aV"Should we get the usual?"
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aV"Or maybe something a little more adventurous?"
p121
aVOkay, so when you're playing baseball,
p122
aVso if we talk about during sexual activity,
p123
aVwhen you're playing baseball,
p124
aVyou're just supposed to round the bases
p125
aVin the proper order one at a time.
p126
aVYou can't hit the ball and run to right field.
p127
aVThat doesn't work.
p128
aVAnd you also can't get to second base and say,
p129
aV"I like it here. I'm going to stay here."
p130
aVNo.
p131
aVAnd also, of course, with baseball, there's, like,
p132
aVthe specific equipment and a specific skill set.
p133
aVNot everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive.
p134
aVOkay, but what about pizza?
p135
aVWhen we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza,
p136
aVisn't it all about what's our pleasure?
p137
aVThere are a million different kinds of pizza.
p138
aVThere's a million different toppings.
p139
aVThere's a million different ways to eat pizza.
p140
aVAnd none of them are wrong. They're different.
p141
aVAnd in this case, difference is good,
p142
aVbecause that's going to increase the chance
p143
aVthat we're having a satisfying experience.
p144
aVAnd lastly, what's the expected outcome of baseball?
p145
aVWell, in baseball, you play to win.
p146
aVYou score as many runs as you can.
p147
aVThere's always a winner in baseball,
p148
aVand that means there's always a loser in baseball.
p149
aVBut what about pizza?
p150
aVWell, in pizza, we're not really \u2014
p151
aVthere's no winning. How do you win pizza?
p152
aVYou don't. But you do look for,
p153
aV"Are we satisfied?"
p154
aVAnd sometimes that can be different amounts
p155
aVover different times or with different people
p156
aVor on different days.
p157
aVAnd we get to decide when we feel satisfied.
p158
aVIf we're still hungry, we might have some more.
p159
aVIf you eat too much, though,
p160
aVyou just feel gross.
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVSo what if we could take this pizza model
p163
aVand overlay it on top of sexuality education?
p164
aVA lot of sexuality education that happens today
p165
aVis so influenced by the baseball model,
p166
aVand it sets up education that can't help
p167
aVbut produce unhealthy sexuality in young people.
p168
aVAnd those young people become older people.
p169
aVBut if we could create sexuality education
p170
aVthat was more like pizza,
p171
aVwe could create education that invites people
p172
aVto think about their own desires,
p173
aVto make deliberate decisions about what they want,
p174
aVto talk about it with their partners,
p175
aVand to ultimately look for
p176
aVnot some external outcome
p177
aVbut for what feels satisfying,
p178
aVand we get to decide that.
p179
aVYou may have noticed
p180
aVin the baseball and pizza comparison,
p181
aVunder the baseball, it's all commands.
p182
aVThey're all exclamation points.
p183
aVBut under the pizza model, they're questions.
p184
aVAnd who gets to answer those questions?
p185
aVYou do. I do.
p186
aVSo remember, when we're thinking about
p187
aVsexuality education and sexual activity,
p188
aVbaseball, you're out.
p189
aVPizza is the way to think about healthy,
p190
aVsatisfying sexual activity,
p191
aVand good, comprehensive sexuality education.
p192
aVThank you very much for your time.
p193
aV(Applause)

VBillie Jean King: Hi, everyone!
p5
aa(lp6
V(Applause)
p7
aa(lp8
VThanks, Pat.
p9
aVThank you!
p10
aVGetting me all wound up, now!
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VPat Mitchell: Good!
p15
aVYou know, when I was watching the video again of the match,
p16
aVyou must have felt like the fate of the world's women
p17
aVwas on every stroke you took.
p18
aVWere you feeling that?
p19
aa(lp20
VBJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs \u2014 he was the former number one player,
p21
aVhe wasn't just some hacker, by the way.
p22
aVHe was one of my heroes and I admired him.
p23
aVAnd that's the reason I beat him, actually, because I respected him.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VIt's true \u2014 my mom and especially my dad always said:
p28
aV"Respect your opponent, and never underestimate them, ever."
p29
aVAnd he was correct. He was absolutely correct.
p30
aVBut I knew it was about social change.
p31
aVAnd I was really nervous whenever we announced it,
p32
aVand I felt like the whole world was on my shoulders.
p33
aVAnd I thought, "If I lose, it's going to put women back 50 years, at least."
p34
aVTitle IX had just been passed the year before \u2014 June 23, 1972.
p35
aVAnd women's professional tennis \u2014
p36
aVthere were nine of us who signed a one-dollar contract in 1970 \u2014
p37
aVnow remember, the match is in '73.
p38
aVSo we were only in our third year of having a tour
p39
aVwhere we could actually play, have a place to compete and make a living.
p40
aVSo there were nine of us that signed that one-dollar contract.
p41
aVAnd our dream was for any girl, born any place in the world \u2014
p42
aVif she was good enough \u2014
p43
aVthere would be a place for her to compete and for us to make a living.
p44
aVBecause before 1968, we made 14 dollars a day,
p45
aVand we were under the control of organizations.
p46
aVSo we really wanted to break away from that.
p47
aVBut we knew it wasn't really about our generation so much;
p48
aVwe knew it was about the future generations.
p49
aa(lp50
VWe do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us, there is no question.
p51
aVBut every generation has the chance to make it better.
p52
aVThat was really on my mind.
p53
aVI really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to Title IX.
p54
aVTitle IX, in case anybody doesn't know, which a lot of people probably don't,
p55
aVsaid that any federal funds given to a high school, college or university,
p56
aVeither public or private,
p57
aVhad to \u2014 finally \u2014 give equal monies to boys and girls.
p58
aVAnd that changed everything.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VSo you can have a law,
p63
aVbut it's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it.
p64
aVThat's when it really rocks, totally.
p65
aVSo that was on my mind.
p66
aVI wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut two things came out of that match.
p69
aVFor women: self-confidence, empowerment.
p70
aVThey actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise.
p71
aVSome women have waited 10, 15 years to ask.
p72
aVI said, "More importantly, did you get it?"
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd they did!
p77
aVAnd for the men?
p78
aVA lot of the men today don't realize it,
p79
aVbut if you're in your 50s, 60s or whatever, late 40s,
p80
aVyou're the first generation of men of the Women's Movement \u2014
p81
aVwhether you like it or not!
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
V(Applause)
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd for the men,
p88
aVwhat happened for the men, they'd come up to me \u2014
p89
aVand most times, the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes,
p90
aVit's very interesting.
p91
aVThey go, "Billie, I was very young when I saw that match,
p92
aVand now I have a daughter.
p93
aVAnd I am so happy I saw that as a young man."
p94
aVAnd one of those young men, at 12 years old, was President Obama.
p95
aVAnd he actually told me that when I met him, he said:
p96
aV"You don't realize it, but I saw that match at 12.
p97
aVAnd now I have two daughters,
p98
aVand it has made a difference in how I raise them."
p99
aVSo both men and women got a lot out of it, but different things.
p100
aa(lp101
VPM: And now there are generations \u2014 at least one or two \u2014
p102
aVwho have experienced the equality
p103
aVthat Title IX and other fights along the way made possible.
p104
aVAnd for women, there are generations who have also experienced teamwork.
p105
aVThey got to play team sports in a way they hadn't before.
p106
aVSo you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete,
p107
aVa legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes
p108
aVand the Women's Sports Foundation.
p109
aVWhat now are you looking to accomplish
p110
aVwith The Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative?
p111
aa(lp112
VBJK: I think it goes back to an epiphany I had at 12.
p113
aVAt 11, I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world,
p114
aVand a friend had asked me to play and I said, "What's that?"
p115
aVTennis was not in my family \u2014 basketball was, other sports.
p116
aVFast forward to 12 years old,
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
Vand I'm finally starting to play in tournaments
p121
aVwhere you get a ranking at the end of the year.
p122
aVSo I was daydreaming at the Los Angeles Tennis Club,
p123
aVand I started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was,
p124
aVbut also that everybody who played wore white shoes, white clothes,
p125
aVplayed with white balls \u2014 everybody who played was white.
p126
aVAnd I said to myself, at 12 years old, "Where is everyone else?"
p127
aVAnd that just kept sticking in my brain.
p128
aVAnd that moment,
p129
aVI promised myself I'd fight for equal rights and opportunities
p130
aVfor boys and girls, men and women, the rest of my life.
p131
aVAnd that tennis, if I was fortunate enough to become number one \u2014
p132
aVand I knew, being a girl, it would be harder to have influence,
p133
aValready at that age \u2014
p134
aVthat I had this platform.
p135
aVAnd tennis is global.
p136
aVAnd I thought, "You know what?
p137
aVI've been given an opportunity that very few people have had."
p138
aVI didn't know if I was going to make it \u2014 this was only 12.
p139
aVI sure wanted it, but making it is a whole other discussion.
p140
aVI just remember I promised myself, and I really try to keep my word.
p141
aVThat's who I truly am, just fighting for people.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd, unfortunately, women have had less.
p144
aVAnd we are considered less.
p145
aVAnd so my attentions, where did they have to go?
p146
aVIt was just ... you have to.
p147
aVAnd learn to stick up for yourself, hear your own voice.
p148
aVYou hear the same words keep coming out all the time,
p149
aVand I got really lucky because I had an education.
p150
aVAnd I think if you can see it you can be it, you know?
p151
aVIf you can see it, you can be it.
p152
aVYou look at Pat, you look at other leaders,
p153
aVyou look at these speakers, look at yourself,
p154
aVbecause everyone \u2014
p155
aVeveryone \u2014
p156
aVcan do something extraordinary.
p157
aVEvery single person.
p158
aa(lp159
VPM: And your story, Billie, has inspired so many women everywhere.
p160
aVNow with the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative,
p161
aVyou're taking on an even bigger cause.
p162
aVBecause one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice,
p163
aVworking to find their way into leadership positions.
p164
aVBut what you're talking about is even bigger than that.
p165
aVIt's inclusive leadership.
p166
aVAnd this is a generation that has grown up thinking more inclusively \u2014
p167
aa(lp168
VBJK: Isn't it great? Look at the technology!
p169
aVIt's amazing how it connects us all! It's about connection.
p170
aVIt's simply amazing what's possible because of it.
p171
aVBut the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative
p172
aVis really about the workforce mostly, and trying to change it,
p173
aVso people can actually go to work and be their authentic selves.
p174
aa(lp175
VBecause most of us have two jobs:
p176
aVOne, to fit in \u2014 I'll give you a perfect example.
p177
aVAn African American woman gets up an hour earlier to go to work,
p178
aVstraightens her hair in the bathroom,
p179
aVgoes to the bathroom probably four, five, six times a day
p180
aVto keep straightening her hair, to keep making sure she fits in.
p181
aVSo she's working two jobs.
p182
aVShe's got this other job, whatever that may be,
p183
aVbut she's also trying to fit in.
p184
aVOr this poor man who kept his diploma \u2014
p185
aVhe went to University of Michigan,
p186
aVbut he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster, ever \u2014
p187
aVjust would not mention it.
p188
aVSo he made sure they saw he was well-educated.
p189
aVAnd then you see a gay guy who has an NFL \u2014
p190
aVwhich means American football for all of you out there,
p191
aVit's a big deal, it's very macho \u2014
p192
aVand he talked about football all the time,
p193
aVbecause he was gay and he didn't want anybody to know.
p194
aVIt just goes on and on.
p195
aVSo my wish for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self 24/7,
p196
aVthat would be the ultimate.
p197
aVAnd we catch ourselves \u2014 I mean, I catch myself to this day.
p198
aVEven being gay I catch myself, you know, like,
p199
aa(lp200
V(Gasp)
p201
aa(lp202
Va little uncomfortable, a little surge in my gut,
p203
aVfeeling not totally comfortable in my own skin.
p204
aVSo, I think you have to ask yourself \u2014
p205
aVI want people to be themselves, whatever that is, just let it be.
p206
aa(lp207
VPM: And the first research the Leadership Initiative did showed that,
p208
aVthat these examples you just used \u2014
p209
aVthat many of us have the problem of being authentic.
p210
aVBut what you've just looked at is this millennial generation,
p211
aVwho have benefited from all these equal opportunities \u2014
p212
aVwhich may not be equal but exist everywhere \u2014
p213
aa(lp214
VBJK: First of all, I'm really lucky.
p215
aVPartnership with Teneo, a strategic company that's amazing.
p216
aVThat's really the reason I'm able to do this.
p217
aVI've had two times in my life
p218
aVwhere I've actually had men really behind me with power.
p219
aVAnd that was in the old days with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims,
p220
aVand this is the second time in my entire life.
p221
aVAnd then Deloitte.
p222
aVThe one thing I wanted was data \u2014 facts.
p223
aVSo Deloitte sent out a survey,
p224
aVand over 4,000 people now have answered,
p225
aVand we're continuing in the workplace.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd what do the millennials feel?
p228
aVWell, they feel a lot, but what they're so fantastic about is \u2014
p229
aVyou know, our generation was like, "Oh, we're going to get representation."
p230
aVSo if you walk into a room, you see everybody represented.
p231
aVThat's not good enough anymore, which is so good!
p232
aVSo the millennials are fantastic; they want connection, engagement.
p233
aVThey just want you to tell us what you're feeling, what you're thinking,
p234
aVand get into the solution.
p235
aVThey're problem-solvers,
p236
aVand of course, you've got the information at your fingertips,
p237
aVcompared to when I was growing up.
p238
aa(lp239
VPM: What did the research show you about millennials?
p240
aVAre they going to make a difference?
p241
aVAre they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force?
p242
aa(lp243
VBJK: Well, in 2025, 75 percent of the global workforce
p244
aVis going to be millennials.
p245
aVI think they are going to help solve problems.
p246
aVI think they have the wherewithal to do it.
p247
aVI know they care a lot.
p248
aVThey have big ideas and they can make big things happen.
p249
aVI want to stay in the now with the young people,
p250
aVI don't want to get behind.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VPM: I don't think there's any chance!
p255
aVBut what you found out in the research about millennials
p256
aVis not really the experience that a lot of people have with millennials.
p257
aa(lp258
VBJK: No, well, if we want to talk \u2014 OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.
p259
aVI've been talking to the Boomers, who are their bosses, and I go,
p260
aV"What do you think about the millennials?"
p261
aVAnd I'm pretty excited, like it's good,
p262
aVand they get this face \u2014
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
V"Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?"
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VI say, "Do you really think so?
p271
aVBecause I do think they care about the environment
p272
aVand all these things."
p273
aVAnd they go, "Oh, Billie, they cannot focus."
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VThey actually have proven
p278
aa(lp279
Vthat the average focus for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VThey can't focus.
p284
aVAnd they don't really care.
p285
aVI just heard a story the other night:
p286
aVa woman owns a gallery and she has these workers.
p287
aVShe gets a text from one of the workers,
p288
aVlike an intern, she's just starting \u2014 she goes,
p289
aV"Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late because I'm at the hairdresser's."
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VSo she arrives, and this boss says,
p294
aV"What's going on?"
p295
aVAnd she says, "Oh, I was late, sorry, how's it going?"
p296
aVShe says, "Well, guess what? I'd like you leave, you're finished."
p297
aVShe goes, "OK."
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VNo problem!
p302
aVPM: Now Billie, that story \u2014
p303
aVI know, but that's what scares the boomers \u2014
p304
aVI'm just telling you \u2014 so I think it's good for us to share.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VNo, it is good for us to share,
p309
aVbecause we're our authentic selves and what we're really feeling,
p310
aVso we've got to take it both ways, you know?
p311
aVBut I have great faith because \u2014
p312
aVif you've been in sports like I have \u2014
p313
aVevery generation gets better.
p314
aVIt's a fact.
p315
aVWith the Women's Sports Foundation being the advocates for Title IX still,
p316
aVbecause we're trying to keep protecting the law,
p317
aVbecause it's in a tenuous position always,
p318
aVso we really are concerned,
p319
aVand we do a lot of research.
p320
aVThat's very important to us.
p321
aVAnd I want to hear from people.
p322
aVBut we really have to protect what Title IX stands for worldwide.
p323
aVAnd you heard President Carter talk about how Title IX is protected.
p324
aVAnd do you know that every single lawsuit
p325
aVthat girls, at least in sports, have gone up against \u2014
p326
aVwhatever institutions \u2014
p327
aVhas won?
p328
aVTitle IX is there to protect us.
p329
aVAnd it is amazing.
p330
aVBut we still have to get the hearts and minds \u2014
p331
aVthe hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge.
p332
aa(lp333
VPM: So what gets you up every morning?
p334
aVWhat keeps you sustaining your work,
p335
aVsustaining the fight for equality, extending it,
p336
aValways exploring new areas, trying to find new ways ... ?
p337
aa(lp338
VBJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazy because I was always the curious one.
p339
aVI'm highly motivated.
p340
aVMy younger brother was a Major League Baseball player.
p341
aVMy poor parents did not care if we were any good.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd we drove them crazy because we pushed,
p346
aVwe pushed because we wanted to be the best.
p347
aVAnd I think it's because of what I'm hearing today in TED talks.
p348
aVI think to listen to these different women,
p349
aVto listen to different people,
p350
aVto listen to President Carter \u2014 90 years old, by the way,
p351
aVand he we was throwing these figures out that I would never \u2014
p352
aVI'd have to go,
p353
aV"Excuse me, wait a minute, I need to get a list out of these figures."
p354
aVHe was rattling off \u2014 I mean, that's amazing, I'm sorry.
p355
aa(lp356
VPM: He's an amazing man.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Applause)
p359
aa(lp360
VBJK: And then you're going to have President Mary Robinson,
p361
aVwho's a former president \u2014
p362
aVThank you, Irish! 62 percent! LGBTQ! Yes!
p363
aa(lp364
V(Applause)
p365
aa(lp366
VCongress is voting in June on same-sex marriage,
p367
aVso these are things that for some people are very hard to hear.
p368
aVBut always remember, every one of us is an individual,
p369
aVa human being with a beating heart,
p370
aVwho cares and wants to live their authentic life.
p371
aVOK? You don't have to agree with somebody,
p372
aVbut everyone has the opportunity.
p373
aa(lp374
VI think we all have an obligation
p375
aVto continue to keep moving the needle forward, always.
p376
aVAnd these people have been so inspiring.
p377
aVEveryone matters.
p378
aVAnd every one of you is an influencer.
p379
aVYou out there listening, out there in the world, plus the people here \u2014
p380
aVevery single person's an influencer.
p381
aVNever, ever forget that. OK?
p382
aVSo don't ever give up on yourself.
p383
aa(lp384
VPM: Billie, you have been an inspiration for us.
p385
aa(lp386
VBJK: Thanks, Pat!
p387
aa(lp388
V(Applause)
p389
aa(lp390
VThanks, TED!
p391
aa(lp392
V(Applause)
p393
aa(lp394

VSydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney.
p5
aVI got to the airport, to the hotel, checked in,
p6
aVand, sitting there in the lobby, was a brochure
p7
aVfor the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it,
p8
aVand I came across a show called "Minto: Live."
p9
aVThe description read: "The suburban streets of Minto
p10
aVbecome the stage for performances
p11
aVcreated by international artists
p12
aVin collaboration with the people of Minto."
p13
aa(lp14
VWhat was this place called Minto?
p15
aVSydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs,
p16
aVand Minto lies southwest, about an hour away.
p17
aVI have to say, it wasn't exactly what I had in mind
p18
aVfor my first day down under.
p19
aVI mean, I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach,
p20
aVbut Minto? But still, I'm a producer,
p21
aVand the lure of a site-specific theater project
p22
aVwas more than I could resist. (Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VSo, off I went into Friday afternoon traffic,
p25
aVand I'll never forget what I saw when I got there.
p26
aVFor the performance, the audience walked
p27
aVaround the neighborhood from house to house,
p28
aVand the residents, who were the performers,
p29
aVthey came out of their houses, and they performed
p30
aVthese autobiographical dances on their lawns,
p31
aVon their driveways. (Laughter)
p32
aVThe show is a collaboration with a U.K.-based
p33
aVperformance company called Lone Twin.
p34
aVLone Twin had come to Minto and worked
p35
aVwith the residents, and they had created these dances.
p36
aa(lp37
VThis Australian-Indian girl, she came out and started
p38
aVto dance on her front lawn,
p39
aVand her father peered out the window to see
p40
aVwhat all the noise and commotion was about,
p41
aVand he soon joined her.
p42
aVAnd he was followed by her little sister.
p43
aVAnd soon they were all dancing this joyous,
p44
aVexuberant dance right there on their lawn. (Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd as I walked through the neighborhood,
p47
aVI was amazed and I was moved by the incredible
p48
aVsense of ownership this community clearly felt
p49
aVabout this event.
p50
aV"Minto: Live" brought Sydneysiders into dialogue
p51
aVwith international artists, and really celebrated
p52
aVthe diversity of Sydney on its own terms.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe Sydney Festival which produced "Minto: Live" I think
p55
aVrepresents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival.
p56
aVThese festivals are radically open.
p57
aVThey can transform cities and communities.
p58
aa(lp59
VTo understand this, I think it kind of makes sense
p60
aVto look where we've come from.
p61
aVModern arts festivals were born
p62
aVin the rubble of World War II.
p63
aVCivic leaders created these annual events
p64
aVto celebrate culture as the highest
p65
aVexpression of the human spirit.
p66
aVIn 1947, the Edinburgh Festival was born
p67
aVand Avignon was born and hundreds of others
p68
aVwould follow in their wake.
p69
aVThe work they did was very, very high art,
p70
aVand stars came along like Laurie Anderson
p71
aVand Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage
p72
aVwho made work for this circuit,
p73
aVand you had these seminal shows like "The Mahabharata"
p74
aVand the monumental "Einstein on the Beach."
p75
aa(lp76
VBut as the decades passed,
p77
aVthese festivals, they really became the establishment,
p78
aVand as the culture and capital accelerated,
p79
aVthe Internet brought us all together,
p80
aVhigh and low kind of disappeared,
p81
aVa new kind of festival emerged.
p82
aa(lp83
VThe old festivals, they continued to thrive, but
p84
aVfrom Brighton to Rio to Perth, something new was emerging,
p85
aVand these festivals were really different.
p86
aVThey're open, these festivals, because, like in Minto,
p87
aVthey understand that the dialogue
p88
aVbetween the local and the global is essential.
p89
aVThey're open because they ask the audience to be a player,
p90
aVa protagonist, a partner, rather than a passive spectator,
p91
aVand they're open because they know that imagination
p92
aVcannot be contained in buildings,
p93
aVand so much of the work they do
p94
aVis site-specific or outdoor work.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo, the new festival, it asks the audience to play
p97
aVan essential role in shaping the performance.
p98
aVCompanies like De La Guarda, which I produce, and Punchdrunk
p99
aVcreate these completely immersive experiences
p100
aVthat put the audience at the center of the action,
p101
aVbut the German performance company Rimini Protokoll
p102
aVtakes this all to a whole new level.
p103
aVIn a series of shows that includes "100 Percent Vancouver,"
p104
aV"100 Percent Berlin," Rimini Protokoll makes shows
p105
aVthat actually reflect society.
p106
aVRimini Protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city
p107
aVat that moment in terms of race and gender and class,
p108
aVthrough a careful process that begins three months before,
p109
aVand then those 100 people share stories about
p110
aVthemselves and their lives, and the whole thing
p111
aVbecomes a snapshot of that city at that moment.
p112
aVLIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues.
p113
aVThey understand that theater and performance
p114
aVcan happen anywhere.
p115
aVYou can do a show in a schoolroom,
p116
aVin an airport, \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p117
aVin a department store window.
p118
aa(lp119
VArtists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew?
p120
aVArtists can take us to a far-flung part of the city
p121
aVthat we haven't explored, or they can take us into
p122
aVthat building that we pass every day but we never went into.
p123
aa(lp124
VAn artist, I think, can really show us people
p125
aVthat we might overlook in our lives.
p126
aVBack to Back is an Australian company of people
p127
aVwith intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show
p128
aVin New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal
p129
aVat rush hour.
p130
aVWe, the audience, were given headsets and seated
p131
aVon one side of the terminal.
p132
aVThe actors were right there in front of us,
p133
aVright there among the commuters,
p134
aVand we could hear them,
p135
aVbut we might not have otherwise seen them.
p136
aVSo Back to Back takes site-specific theater and uses it
p137
aVto gently remind us about who and what we choose
p138
aVto edit out of our daily lives.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo, the dialogue with the local and the global,
p141
aVthe audience as participant and player and protagonist,
p142
aVthe innovative use of site, all of these things
p143
aVcome to play in the amazing work
p144
aVof the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe.
p145
aVRoyal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city
p146
aVand they live there for a few days.
p147
aa(lp148
VFor "The Sultan's Elephant," Royal de Luxe
p149
aVcame to central London and brought it to a standstill
p150
aVwith their story of a giant little girl and her friend,
p151
aVa time-traveling elephant.
p152
aVFor a few days, they transformed a massive city
p153
aVinto a community where endless possibility reigned.
p154
aVThe Guardian wrote, "If art is about transformation,
p155
aVthen there can be no more transformative experience.
p156
aVWhat 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less
p157
aVthan an artistic occupation of the city
p158
aVand a reclamation of the streets for the people."
p159
aa(lp160
VWe can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals
p161
aVon their cities, but I'm much [more] interested in many more things,
p162
aVlike how a festival helps a city to express itself,
p163
aVhow it lets it come into its own.
p164
aVFestivals promote diversity,
p165
aVthey bring neighbors into dialogue,
p166
aVthey increase creativity,
p167
aVthey offer opportunities for civic pride,
p168
aVthey improve our general psychological well-being.
p169
aVIn short, they make cities better places to live.
p170
aa(lp171
VCase in point:
p172
aVWhen "The Sultan's Elephant" came to London
p173
aVjust nine months after 7/7, a Londoner wrote,
p174
aV"For the first time since the London bombings,
p175
aVmy daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice.
p176
aVShe had gathered with others
p177
aVto watch 'The Sultan's Elephant,' and, you know,
p178
aVit just made all the difference."
p179
aVLyn Gardner in The Guardian has written
p180
aVthat a great festival can show us a map of the world,
p181
aVa map of the city and a map of ourselves,
p182
aVbut there is no one fixed festival model.
p183
aVI think what's so brilliant about the festivals,
p184
aVthe new festivals, is that they are really fully capturing
p185
aVthe complexity and the excitement
p186
aVof the way we all live today.
p187
aVThank you very much. (Applause)

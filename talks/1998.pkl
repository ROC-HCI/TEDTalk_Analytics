VThere's a man by the name of Captain
p5
aVWilliam Swenson
p6
aVwho recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor
p7
aVfor his actions on September 8, 2009.
p8
aa(lp9
VOn that day, a column of American
p10
aVand Afghan troops
p11
aVwere making their way
p12
aVthrough a part of Afghanistan
p13
aVto help protect
p14
aVa group of government officials,
p15
aVa group of Afghan government officials,
p16
aVwho would be meeting with some local
p17
aVvillage elders.
p18
aVThe column came under ambush,
p19
aVand was surrounded on three sides,
p20
aVand amongst many other things,
p21
aVCaptain Swenson was recognized
p22
aVfor running into live fire
p23
aVto rescue the wounded
p24
aVand pull out the dead.
p25
aVOne of the people he rescued was a sergeant,
p26
aVand he and a comrade were making their way
p27
aVto a medevac helicopter.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd what was remarkable about this day
p30
aVis, by sheer coincidence,
p31
aVone of the medevac medics
p32
aVhappened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet
p33
aVand captured the whole scene on camera.
p34
aVIt shows Captain Swenson and his comrade
p35
aVbringing this wounded soldier
p36
aVwho had received a gunshot to the neck.
p37
aVThey put him in the helicopter,
p38
aVand then you see Captain Swenson bend over
p39
aVand give him a kiss
p40
aVbefore he turns around to rescue more.
p41
aa(lp42
VI saw this, and I thought to myself,
p43
aVwhere do people like that come from?
p44
aVWhat is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,
p45
aVwhen you would want to do that.
p46
aVThere's a love there,
p47
aVand I wanted to know why is it that
p48
aVI don't have people that I work with like that?
p49
aVYou know, in the military, they give medals
p50
aVto people who are willing to sacrifice themselves
p51
aVso that others may gain.
p52
aVIn business, we give bonuses to people
p53
aVwho are willing to sacrifice others
p54
aVso that we may gain.
p55
aVWe have it backwards. Right?
p56
aVSo I asked myself, where do people like this come from?
p57
aVAnd my initial conclusion was that they're just better people.
p58
aVThat's why they're attracted to the military.
p59
aVThese better people are attracted
p60
aVto this concept of service.
p61
aVBut that's completely wrong.
p62
aVWhat I learned was that it's the environment,
p63
aVand if you get the environment right,
p64
aVevery single one of us has the capacity
p65
aVto do these remarkable things,
p66
aVand more importantly, others have that capacity too.
p67
aVI've had the great honor of getting to meet
p68
aVsome of these, who we would call heroes,
p69
aVwho have put themselves and put their lives
p70
aVat risk to save others,
p71
aVand I asked them, "Why would you do it?
p72
aVWhy did you do it?"
p73
aVAnd they all say the same thing:
p74
aV"Because they would have done it for me."
p75
aVIt's this deep sense of trust and cooperation.
p76
aVSo trust and cooperation are really important here.
p77
aVThe problem with concepts of trust and cooperation
p78
aVis that they are feelings, they are not instructions.
p79
aVI can't simply say to you, "Trust me," and you will.
p80
aVI can't simply instruct two people  to cooperate, and they will.
p81
aVIt's not how it works. It's a feeling.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo where does that feeling come from?
p84
aVIf you go back 50,000 years
p85
aVto the Paleolithic era,
p86
aVto the early days of Homo sapiens,
p87
aVwhat we find is that the world
p88
aVwas filled with danger,
p89
aVall of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.
p90
aVNothing personal.
p91
aVWhether it was the weather,
p92
aVlack of resources,
p93
aVmaybe a saber-toothed tiger,
p94
aVall of these things working
p95
aVto reduce our lifespan.
p96
aVAnd so we evolved into social animals,
p97
aVwhere we lived together and worked together
p98
aVin what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe,
p99
aVwhere we felt like we belonged.
p100
aVAnd when we felt safe amongst our own,
p101
aVthe natural reaction was trust and cooperation.
p102
aVThere are inherent benefits to this.
p103
aVIt means I can fall asleep at night
p104
aVand trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger.
p105
aVIf we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you,
p106
aVthat means you won't watch for danger.
p107
aVBad system of survival.
p108
aa(lp109
VThe modern day is exactly the same thing.
p110
aVThe world is filled with danger,
p111
aVthings that are trying to frustrate our lives
p112
aVor reduce our success,
p113
aVreduce our opportunity for success.
p114
aVIt could be the ups and downs in the economy,
p115
aVthe uncertainty of the stock market.
p116
aVIt could be a new technology that renders
p117
aVyour business model obsolete overnight.
p118
aVOr it could be your competition
p119
aVthat is sometimes trying to kill you.
p120
aVIt's sometimes trying to put you out of business,
p121
aVbut at the very minimum
p122
aVis working hard to frustrate your growth
p123
aVand steal your business from you.
p124
aVWe have no control over these forces.
p125
aVThese are a constant,
p126
aVand they're not going away.
p127
aa(lp128
VThe only variable are the conditions
p129
aVinside the organization,
p130
aVand that's where leadership matters,
p131
aVbecause it's the leader that sets the tone.
p132
aVWhen a leader makes the choice
p133
aVto put the safety and lives
p134
aVof the people inside the organization first,
p135
aVto sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice
p136
aVthe tangible results, so that the people remain
p137
aVand feel safe and feel like they belong,
p138
aVremarkable things happen.
p139
aa(lp140
VI was flying on a trip,
p141
aVand I was witness to an incident
p142
aVwhere a passenger attempted to board
p143
aVbefore their number was called,
p144
aVand I watched the gate agent
p145
aVtreat this man like he had broken the law,
p146
aVlike a criminal.
p147
aVHe was yelled at for attempting to board
p148
aVone group too soon.
p149
aVSo I said something.
p150
aVI said, "Why do you have treat us like cattle?
p151
aVWhy can't you treat us like human beings?"
p152
aVAnd this is exactly what she said to me.
p153
aVShe said, "Sir, if I don't follow the rules,
p154
aVI could get in trouble or lose my job."
p155
aVAll she was telling me
p156
aVis that she doesn't feel safe.
p157
aVAll she was telling me is that
p158
aVshe doesn't trust her leaders.
p159
aVThe reason we like flying Southwest Airlines
p160
aVis not because they necessarily hire better people.
p161
aVIt's because they don't fear their leaders.
p162
aa(lp163
VYou see, if the conditions are wrong,
p164
aVwe are forced to expend our own time and energy
p165
aVto protect ourselves from each other,
p166
aVand that inherently weakens the organization.
p167
aVWhen we feel safe inside the organization,
p168
aVwe will naturally combine our talents
p169
aVand our strengths and work tirelessly
p170
aVto face the dangers outside
p171
aVand seize the opportunities.
p172
aa(lp173
VThe closest analogy I can give
p174
aVto what a great leader is, is like being a parent.
p175
aVIf you think about what being a great parent is,
p176
aVwhat do you want? What makes a great parent?
p177
aVWe want to give our child opportunities,
p178
aVeducation, discipline them when necessary,
p179
aVall so that they can grow up and achieve more
p180
aVthan we could for ourselves.
p181
aVGreat leaders want exactly the same thing.
p182
aVThey want to provide their people opportunity,
p183
aVeducation, discipline when necessary,
p184
aVbuild their self-confidence, give them the opportunity to try and fail,
p185
aVall so that they could achieve more
p186
aVthan we could ever imagine for ourselves.
p187
aa(lp188
VCharlie Kim, who's the CEO of a company called Next Jump
p189
aVin New York City, a tech company,
p190
aVhe makes the point that
p191
aVif you had hard times in your family,
p192
aVwould you ever consider laying off one of your children?
p193
aVWe would never do it.
p194
aVThen why do we consider laying off people
p195
aVinside our organization?
p196
aVCharlie implemented a policy
p197
aVof lifetime employment.
p198
aVIf you get a job at Next Jump,
p199
aVyou cannot get fired for performance issues.
p200
aVIn fact, if you have issues,
p201
aVthey will coach you and they will give you support,
p202
aVjust like we would with one of our children
p203
aVwho happens to come home with a C from school.
p204
aVIt's the complete opposite.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis is the reason so many people
p207
aVhave such a visceral hatred, anger,
p208
aVat some of these banking CEOs
p209
aVwith their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures.
p210
aVIt's not the numbers.
p211
aVIt's that they have violated the very definition of leadership.
p212
aVThey have violated this deep-seated social contract.
p213
aVWe know that they allowed their people
p214
aVto be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests,
p215
aVor worse, they sacrificed their people
p216
aVto protect their own interests.
p217
aVThis is what so offends us, not the numbers.
p218
aVWould anybody be offended if we gave
p219
aVa $150 million bonus to Gandhi?
p220
aVHow about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa?
p221
aVDo we have an issue with that? None at all.
p222
aVNone at all.
p223
aVGreat leaders would never sacrifice
p224
aVthe people to save the numbers.
p225
aVThey would sooner sacrifice the numbers
p226
aVto save the people.
p227
aa(lp228
VBob Chapman, who runs
p229
aVa large manufacturing company in the Midwest
p230
aVcalled Barry-Wehmiller,
p231
aVin 2008 was hit very hard by the recession,
p232
aVand they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight.
p233
aVNow in a large manufacturing company,
p234
aVthis is a big deal,
p235
aVand they could no longer afford their labor pool.
p236
aVThey needed to save 10 million dollars,
p237
aVso, like so many companies today,
p238
aVthe board got together and discussed layoffs.
p239
aVAnd Bob refused.
p240
aVYou see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts.
p241
aVBob believes in heart counts,
p242
aVand it's much more difficult to simply reduce
p243
aVthe heart count.
p244
aVAnd so they came up with a furlough program.
p245
aVEvery employee, from secretary to CEO,
p246
aVwas required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation.
p247
aVThey could take it any time they wanted,
p248
aVand they did not have to take it consecutively.
p249
aVBut it was how Bob announced the program
p250
aVthat mattered so much.
p251
aVHe said, it's better that we should all suffer a little
p252
aVthan any of us should have to suffer a lot,
p253
aVand morale went up.
p254
aVThey saved 20 million dollars,
p255
aVand most importantly, as would be expected,
p256
aVwhen the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization,
p257
aVthe natural reaction is to trust and cooperate.
p258
aVAnd quite spontaneously, nobody expected,
p259
aVpeople started trading with each other.
p260
aVThose who could afford it more
p261
aVwould trade with those who could afford it less.
p262
aVPeople would take five weeks
p263
aVso that somebody else only had to take three.
p264
aa(lp265
VLeadership is a choice. It is not a rank.
p266
aVI know many people at the seniormost
p267
aVlevels of organizations
p268
aVwho are absolutely not leaders.
p269
aVThey are authorities, and we do what they say
p270
aVbecause they have authority over us,
p271
aVbut we would not follow them.
p272
aVAnd I know many people
p273
aVwho are at the bottoms of organizations
p274
aVwho have no authority
p275
aVand they are absolutely leaders,
p276
aVand this is because they have chosen to look after
p277
aVthe person to the left of them,
p278
aVand they have chosen to look after
p279
aVthe person to the right of them.
p280
aVThis is what a leader is.
p281
aa(lp282
VI heard a story
p283
aVof some Marines
p284
aVwho were out in theater,
p285
aVand as is the Marine custom,
p286
aVthe officer ate last,
p287
aVand he let his men eat first,
p288
aVand when they were done,
p289
aVthere was no food left for him.
p290
aVAnd when they went back out in the field,
p291
aVhis men brought him some of their food
p292
aVso that he may eat,
p293
aVbecause that's what happens.
p294
aVWe call them leaders because they go first.
p295
aVWe call them leaders because they take the risk
p296
aVbefore anybody else does.
p297
aVWe call them leaders because they will choose
p298
aVto sacrifice so that their people
p299
aVmay be safe and protected
p300
aVand so their people may gain,
p301
aVand when we do, the natural response
p302
aVis that our people will sacrifice for us.
p303
aVThey will give us their blood and sweat and tears
p304
aVto see that their leader's vision comes to life,
p305
aVand when we ask them, "Why would you do that?
p306
aVWhy would you give your blood and sweat and tears
p307
aVfor that person?" they all say the same thing:
p308
aV"Because they would have done it for me."
p309
aVAnd isn't that the organization
p310
aVwe would all like to work in?
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you very much.
p313
aa(lp314
VThank you. (Applause)
p315
aa(lp316
VThank you. (Applause)

VEverybody talks about happiness these days.
p5
aVI had somebody count the number of books
p6
aVwith "happiness" in the title published in the last five years
p7
aVand they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.
p8
aVThere is a huge wave of interest in happiness,
p9
aVamong researchers.
p10
aVThere is a lot of happiness coaching.
p11
aVEverybody would like to make people happier.
p12
aVBut in spite of all this flood of work,
p13
aVthere are several cognitive traps
p14
aVthat sort of make it almost impossible to think straight
p15
aVabout happiness.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.
p18
aVThis applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,
p19
aVand it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,
p20
aVbecause it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.
p21
aVThe first of these traps
p22
aVis a reluctance to admit complexity.
p23
aVIt turns out that the word "happiness"
p24
aVis just not a useful word anymore,
p25
aVbecause we apply it to too many different things.
p26
aVI think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,
p27
aVbut by and large,
p28
aVthis is something that we'll have to give up
p29
aVand we'll have to adopt the more complicated view
p30
aVof what well-being is.
p31
aVThe second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;
p32
aVbasically, it's between being happy in your life,
p33
aVand being happy about your life
p34
aVor happy with your life.
p35
aVAnd those are two very different concepts,
p36
aVand they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.
p37
aVAnd the third is the focusing illusion,
p38
aVand it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance
p39
aVthat affects well-being
p40
aVwithout distorting its importance.
p41
aVI mean, this is a real cognitive trap.
p42
aVThere's just no way of getting it right.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, I'd like to start with an example
p45
aVof somebody who had a question-and-answer session
p46
aVafter one of my lectures reported a story,
p47
aVand that was a story \u2014
p48
aVHe said he'd been listening to a symphony,
p49
aVand it was absolutely glorious music
p50
aVand at the very end of the recording,
p51
aVthere was a dreadful screeching sound.
p52
aVAnd then he added, really quite emotionally,
p53
aVit ruined the whole experience.
p54
aVBut it hadn't.
p55
aVWhat it had ruined were the memories of the experience.
p56
aVHe had had the experience.
p57
aVHe had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
p58
aVThey counted for nothing
p59
aVbecause he was left with a memory;
p60
aVthe memory was ruined,
p61
aVand the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhat this is telling us, really,
p64
aVis that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people
p65
aVin terms of two selves.
p66
aVThere is an experiencing self,
p67
aVwho lives in the present
p68
aVand knows the present,
p69
aVis capable of re-living the past,
p70
aVbut basically it has only the present.
p71
aVIt's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches \u2014
p72
aVyou know, when the doctor asks,
p73
aV"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"
p74
aVAnd then there is a remembering self,
p75
aVand the remembering self is the one that keeps score,
p76
aVand maintains the story of our life,
p77
aVand it's the one that the doctor approaches
p78
aVin asking the question,
p79
aV"How have you been feeling lately?"
p80
aVor "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.
p81
aVThose are two very different entities,
p82
aVthe experiencing self and the remembering self,
p83
aVand getting confused between them is part of the mess
p84
aVabout the notion of happiness.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, the remembering self
p87
aVis a storyteller.
p88
aVAnd that really starts with a basic response of our memories \u2014
p89
aVit starts immediately.
p90
aVWe don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.
p91
aVOur memory tells us stories,
p92
aVthat is, what we get to keep from our experiences
p93
aVis a story.
p94
aVAnd let me begin with one example.
p95
aVThis is an old study.
p96
aVThose are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.
p97
aVI won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,
p98
aVbut it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.
p99
aVThey were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.
p100
aVHere are two patients,
p101
aVthose are their recordings.
p102
aVAnd you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"
p103
aVAnd it's a very easy question.
p104
aVClearly, Patient B suffered more \u2014
p105
aVhis colonoscopy was longer,
p106
aVand every minute of pain that Patient A had,
p107
aVPatient B had, and more.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut now there is another question:
p110
aV"How much did these patients think they suffered?"
p111
aVAnd here is a surprise.
p112
aVThe surprise is that Patient A
p113
aVhad a much worse memory of the colonoscopy
p114
aVthan Patient B.
p115
aVThe stories of the colonoscopies were different,
p116
aVand because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.
p117
aVAnd neither of these stories is very inspiring or great \u2014
p118
aVbut one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter)
p119
aVbut one of them is distinctly worse than the other.
p120
aVAnd the one that is worse
p121
aVis the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;
p122
aVit's a bad story.
p123
aVHow do we know that?
p124
aVBecause we asked these people after their colonoscopy,
p125
aVand much later, too,
p126
aV"How bad was the whole thing, in total?"
p127
aVAnd it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow this is a direct conflict
p130
aVbetween the experiencing self and the remembering self.
p131
aVFrom the point of view of the experiencing self,
p132
aVclearly, B had a worse time.
p133
aVNow, what you could do with Patient A,
p134
aVand we actually ran clinical experiments,
p135
aVand it has been done, and it does work \u2014
p136
aVyou could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A
p137
aVby just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.
p138
aVThat will cause the patient
p139
aVto suffer, but just a little
p140
aVand much less than before.
p141
aVAnd if you do that for a couple of minutes,
p142
aVyou have made the experiencing self
p143
aVof Patient A worse off,
p144
aVand you have the remembering self of Patient A
p145
aVa lot better off,
p146
aVbecause now you have endowed Patient A
p147
aVwith a better story
p148
aVabout his experience.
p149
aVWhat defines a story?
p150
aVAnd that is true of the stories
p151
aVthat memory delivers for us,
p152
aVand it's also true of the stories that we make up.
p153
aVWhat defines a story are changes,
p154
aVsignificant moments and endings.
p155
aVEndings are very, very important
p156
aVand, in this case, the ending dominated.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, the experiencing self
p159
aVlives its life continuously.
p160
aVIt has moments of experience, one after the other.
p161
aVAnd you can ask: What happens to these moments?
p162
aVAnd the answer is really straightforward:
p163
aVThey are lost forever.
p164
aVI mean, most of the moments of our life \u2014
p165
aVand I calculated, you know, the psychological present
p166
aVis said to be about three seconds long;
p167
aVthat means that, you know,
p168
aVin a life there are about 600 million of them;
p169
aVin a month, there are about 600,000 \u2014
p170
aVmost of them don't leave a trace.
p171
aVMost of them are completely ignored
p172
aVby the remembering self.
p173
aVAnd yet, somehow you get the sense
p174
aVthat they should count,
p175
aVthat what happens during these moments of experience
p176
aVis our life.
p177
aVIt's the finite resource that we're spending
p178
aVwhile we're on this earth.
p179
aVAnd how to spend it
p180
aVwould seem to be relevant,
p181
aVbut that is not the story
p182
aVthat the remembering self keeps for us.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo we have the remembering self
p185
aVand the experiencing self,
p186
aVand they're really quite distinct.
p187
aVThe biggest difference between them
p188
aVis in the handling of time.
p189
aVFrom the point of view of the experiencing self,
p190
aVif you have a vacation,
p191
aVand the second week is just as good as the first,
p192
aVthen the two-week vacation
p193
aVis twice as good as the one-week vacation.
p194
aVThat's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.
p195
aVFor the remembering self, a two-week vacation
p196
aVis barely better than the one-week vacation
p197
aVbecause there are no new memories added.
p198
aVYou have not changed the story.
p199
aVAnd in this way,
p200
aVtime is actually the critical variable
p201
aVthat distinguishes a remembering self
p202
aVfrom an experiencing self;
p203
aVtime has very little impact on the story.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow, the remembering self does more
p206
aVthan remember and tell stories.
p207
aVIt is actually the one that makes decisions
p208
aVbecause, if you have a patient who has had, say,
p209
aVtwo colonoscopies with two different surgeons
p210
aVand is deciding which of them to choose,
p211
aVthen the one that chooses
p212
aVis the one that has the memory that is less bad,
p213
aVand that's the surgeon that will be chosen.
p214
aVThe experiencing self
p215
aVhas no voice in this choice.
p216
aVWe actually don't choose between experiences,
p217
aVwe choose between memories of experiences.
p218
aVAnd even when we think about the future,
p219
aVwe don't think of our future normally as experiences.
p220
aVWe think of our future
p221
aVas anticipated memories.
p222
aVAnd basically you can look at this,
p223
aVyou know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,
p224
aVand you can think of the remembering self
p225
aVsort of dragging the experiencing self
p226
aVthrough experiences that
p227
aVthe experiencing self doesn't need.
p228
aa(lp229
VI have that sense that
p230
aVwhen we go on vacations
p231
aVthis is very frequently the case;
p232
aVthat is, we go on vacations,
p233
aVto a very large extent,
p234
aVin the service of our remembering self.
p235
aVAnd this is a bit hard to justify I think.
p236
aVI mean, how much do we consume our memories?
p237
aVThat is one of the explanations
p238
aVthat is given for the dominance
p239
aVof the remembering self.
p240
aVAnd when I think about that, I think about a vacation
p241
aVwe had in Antarctica a few years ago,
p242
aVwhich was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,
p243
aVand I think of it relatively often,
p244
aVrelative to how much I think of other vacations.
p245
aVAnd I probably have consumed
p246
aVmy memories of that three-week trip, I would say,
p247
aVfor about 25 minutes in the last four years.
p248
aVNow, if I had ever opened the folder
p249
aVwith the 600 pictures in it,
p250
aVI would have spent another hour.
p251
aVNow, that is three weeks,
p252
aVand that is at most an hour and a half.
p253
aVThere seems to be a discrepancy.
p254
aVNow, I may be a bit extreme, you know,
p255
aVin how little appetite I have for consuming memories,
p256
aVbut even if you do more of this,
p257
aVthere is a genuine question:
p258
aVWhy do we put so much weight on memory
p259
aVrelative to the weight that we put on experiences?
p260
aa(lp261
VSo I want you to think
p262
aVabout a thought experiment.
p263
aVImagine that for your next vacation,
p264
aVyou know that at the end of the vacation
p265
aVall your pictures will be destroyed,
p266
aVand you'll get an amnesic drug
p267
aVso that you won't remember anything.
p268
aVNow, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter)
p269
aVAnd if you would choose a different vacation,
p270
aVthere is a conflict between your two selves,
p271
aVand you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,
p272
aVand it's actually not at all obvious, because
p273
aVif you think in terms of time,
p274
aVthen you get one answer,
p275
aVand if you think in terms of memories,
p276
aVyou might get another answer.
p277
aVWhy do we pick the vacations we do
p278
aVis a problem that confronts us
p279
aVwith a choice between the two selves.
p280
aa(lp281
VNow, the two selves
p282
aVbring up two notions of happiness.
p283
aVThere are really two concepts of happiness
p284
aVthat we can apply, one per self.
p285
aVSo you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?
p286
aVAnd then you would ask: How happy are the moments
p287
aVin the experiencing self's life?
p288
aVAnd they're all \u2014 happiness for moments
p289
aVis a fairly complicated process.
p290
aVWhat are the emotions that can be measured?
p291
aVAnd, by the way, now we are capable
p292
aVof getting a pretty good idea
p293
aVof the happiness of the experiencing self over time.
p294
aVIf you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,
p295
aVit's a completely different thing.
p296
aVThis is not about how happily a person lives.
p297
aVIt is about how satisfied or pleased the person is
p298
aVwhen that person thinks about her life.
p299
aVVery different notion.
p300
aVAnyone who doesn't distinguish those notions
p301
aVis going to mess up the study of happiness,
p302
aVand I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,
p303
aVwho've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time
p304
aVin precisely this way.
p305
aa(lp306
VThe distinction between the
p307
aVhappiness of the experiencing self
p308
aVand the satisfaction of the remembering self
p309
aVhas been recognized in recent years,
p310
aVand there are now efforts to measure the two separately.
p311
aVThe Gallup Organization has a world poll
p312
aVwhere more than half a million people
p313
aVhave been asked questions
p314
aVabout what they think of their life
p315
aVand about their experiences,
p316
aVand there have been other efforts along those lines.
p317
aVSo in recent years, we have begun to learn
p318
aVabout the happiness of the two selves.
p319
aVAnd the main lesson I think that we have learned
p320
aVis they are really different.
p321
aVYou can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,
p322
aVand that really doesn't teach you much
p323
aVabout how happily they're living their life,
p324
aVand vice versa.
p325
aVJust to give you a sense of the correlation,
p326
aVthe correlation is about .5.
p327
aVWhat that means is if you met somebody,
p328
aVand you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"
p329
aVhow much would you know about his height?
p330
aVWell, you would know something about his height,
p331
aVbut there's a lot of uncertainty.
p332
aVYou have that much uncertainty.
p333
aVIf I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,
p334
aVyou have a lot of uncertainty
p335
aVabout how happy they are
p336
aVwith their experiencing self.
p337
aVSo the correlation is low.
p338
aa(lp339
VWe know something about what controls
p340
aVsatisfaction of the happiness self.
p341
aVWe know that money is very important,
p342
aVgoals are very important.
p343
aVWe know that happiness is mainly
p344
aVbeing satisfied with people that we like,
p345
aVspending time with people that we like.
p346
aVThere are other pleasures, but this is dominant.
p347
aVSo if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,
p348
aVyou are going to end up
p349
aVdoing very different things.
p350
aVThe bottom line of what I've said here
p351
aVis that we really should not think of happiness
p352
aVas a substitute for well-being.
p353
aVIt is a completely different notion.
p354
aa(lp355
VNow, very quickly,
p356
aVanother reason we cannot think straight about happiness
p357
aVis that we do not attend to the same things
p358
aVwhen we think about life, and we actually live.
p359
aVSo, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,
p360
aVyou are not going to get to the correct answer.
p361
aVWhen you ask that question,
p362
aVyou think people must be happier in California
p363
aVif, say, you live in Ohio.
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aVAnd what happens is
p366
aVwhen you think about living in California,
p367
aVyou are thinking of the contrast
p368
aVbetween California and other places,
p369
aVand that contrast, say, is in climate.
p370
aVWell, it turns out that climate
p371
aVis not very important to the experiencing self
p372
aVand it's not even very important to the reflective self
p373
aVthat decides how happy people are.
p374
aVBut now, because the reflective self is in charge,
p375
aVyou may end up \u2014 some people may end up
p376
aVmoving to California.
p377
aVAnd it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen
p378
aVto people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.
p379
aVWell, their experiencing self
p380
aVis not going to get happier.
p381
aVWe know that.
p382
aVBut one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,
p383
aVbecause, when they think about it,
p384
aVthey'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,
p385
aVand they will feel they made the right decision.
p386
aa(lp387
VIt is very difficult
p388
aVto think straight about well-being,
p389
aVand I hope I have given you a sense
p390
aVof how difficult it is.
p391
aa(lp392
VThank you.
p393
aa(lp394
V(Applause)
p395
aa(lp396
VChris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.
p397
aVThank you so much.
p398
aVNow, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,
p399
aVyou mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result
p400
aVcame out of that Gallup survey.
p401
aVIs that something you can share
p402
aVsince you do have a few moments left now?
p403
aa(lp404
VDaniel Kahneman: Sure.
p405
aVI think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey
p406
aVis a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.
p407
aVWe found that with respect to the happiness
p408
aVof the experiencing self.
p409
aVWhen we looked at how feelings,
p410
aVvary with income.
p411
aVAnd it turns out that, below an income
p412
aVof 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans \u2014
p413
aVand that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,
p414
aVso it's a large representative sample \u2014
p415
aVbelow an income of 600,000 dollars a year...
p416
aa(lp417
VCA: 60,000.
p418
aa(lp419
VDK: 60,000.
p420
aV(Laughter)
p421
aV60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,
p422
aVand they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.
p423
aVAbove that, we get an absolutely flat line.
p424
aVI mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.
p425
aVClearly, what is happening is
p426
aVmoney does not buy you experiential happiness,
p427
aVbut lack of money certainly buys you misery,
p428
aVand we can measure that misery
p429
aVvery, very clearly.
p430
aVIn terms of the other self, the remembering self,
p431
aVyou get a different story.
p432
aVThe more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.
p433
aVThat does not hold for emotions.
p434
aa(lp435
VCA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about
p436
aVlife, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.
p437
aVIf people took seriously that finding,
p438
aVI mean, it seems to turn upside down
p439
aVeverything we believe about, like for example,
p440
aVtaxation policy and so forth.
p441
aVIs there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,
p442
aVwould take a finding like that seriously
p443
aVand run public policy based on it?
p444
aa(lp445
VDK: You know I think that there is recognition
p446
aVof the role of happiness research in public policy.
p447
aVThe recognition is going to be slow in the United States,
p448
aVno question about that,
p449
aVbut in the U.K., it is happening,
p450
aVand in other countries it is happening.
p451
aVPeople are recognizing that they ought
p452
aVto be thinking of happiness
p453
aVwhen they think of public policy.
p454
aVIt's going to take a while,
p455
aVand people are going to debate
p456
aVwhether they want to study experience happiness,
p457
aVor whether they want to study life evaluation,
p458
aVso we need to have that debate fairly soon.
p459
aVHow to enhance happiness
p460
aVgoes very different ways depending on how you think,
p461
aVand whether you think of the remembering self
p462
aVor you think of the experiencing self.
p463
aVThis is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.
p464
aVIn the United States, efforts are being made
p465
aVto measure the experience happiness of the population.
p466
aVThis is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,
p467
aVpart of national statistics.

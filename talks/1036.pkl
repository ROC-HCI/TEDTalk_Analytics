VAlisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins \u2014
p5
aVthe dramatic moments of the birth
p6
aVof our first son, Declan.
p7
aVObviously a really profound moment,
p8
aVand it changed our lives in many ways.
p9
aVIt also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,
p10
aVand those unexpected ways we later reflected on,
p11
aVthat eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,
p12
aVand a year later, we launched Babble,
p13
aVa website for parents.
p14
aa(lp15
VRufus Griscom: Now I think of our story
p16
aVas starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.
p17
aa(lp18
VRG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.
p19
aa(lp20
VAV: We did.
p21
aa(lp22
VRG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.
p23
aVIt was a website called Nerve.com,
p24
aVthe tagline of which was "literate smut."
p25
aVIt was in theory, and hopefully in practice,
p26
aVa smart online magazine
p27
aVabout sex and culture.
p28
aa(lp29
VAV: That spawned a dating site.
p30
aVBut you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.
p31
aVYou follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,
p32
aVwhich we did.
p33
aVAnd we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.
p34
aa(lp35
VRG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble
p36
aVwas not just the life stage thing,
p37
aVwhich is, of course, relevant,
p38
aVbut it was really more about
p39
aVour desire to speak very honestly
p40
aVabout subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.
p41
aVIt seems to us that
p42
aVwhen people start dissembling, people start lying about things,
p43
aVthat's when it gets really interesting.
p44
aVThat's a subject that we want to dive into.
p45
aVAnd we've been surprised to find, as young parents,
p46
aVthat there are almost more taboos around parenting
p47
aVthan there are around sex.
p48
aa(lp49
VAV: It's true. So like we said,
p50
aVthe early years were really wonderful,
p51
aVbut they were also really difficult.
p52
aVAnd we feel like some of that difficulty
p53
aVwas because of this false advertisement around parenting.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVWe subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,
p56
aVbut really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.
p57
aVAnd we went into parenting
p58
aVexpecting our lives to look like this.
p59
aVThe sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.
p60
aVI would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,
p61
aVand in fact, it was not like that at all.
p62
aa(lp63
VRG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine
p64
aVthat we were looking at, with these beautiful images,
p65
aVand looked at the scene in our actual living room,
p66
aVit looked a little bit more like this.
p67
aVThese are our three sons.
p68
aVAnd of course, they're not always crying and screaming,
p69
aVbut with three boys, there's a decent probability
p70
aVthat at least one of them will not be comporting himself
p71
aVexactly as he should.
p72
aa(lp73
VAV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.
p74
aVWe really felt like what we went in expecting
p75
aVhad nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,
p76
aVand so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.
p77
aVWe really wanted to let them understand
p78
aVwhat the realities of parenting were in an honest way.
p79
aa(lp80
VRG: So today, what we would love to do
p81
aVis share with you four parenting taboos.
p82
aVAnd of course, there are many more than four things
p83
aVyou can't say about parenting,
p84
aVbut we would like to share with you today
p85
aVfour that are particularly relevant for us personally.
p86
aVSo the first, taboo number one:
p87
aVyou can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby
p88
aVin the very first minute.
p89
aVI remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.
p90
aVWe were in the process of giving birth to our first child.
p91
aa(lp92
VAV: We, or I?
p93
aa(lp94
VRG: I'm sorry.
p95
aVMisuse of the pronoun.
p96
aVAlisa was very generously in the process
p97
aVof giving birth to our first child \u2014 (AV: Thank you.)
p98
aV\u2014 and I was there with a catcher's mitt.
p99
aVAnd I was there with my arms open.
p100
aVThe nurse was coming at me
p101
aVwith this beautiful, beautiful child,
p102
aVand I remember, as she was approaching me,
p103
aVthe voices of friends saying,
p104
aV"The moment they put the baby in your hands,
p105
aVyou will feel a sense of love that will come over you
p106
aVthat is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful
p107
aVthan anything you've ever experienced in your entire life."
p108
aVSo I was bracing myself for the moment.
p109
aVThe baby was coming,
p110
aVand I was ready for this Mack truck of love
p111
aVto just knock me off my feet.
p112
aVAnd instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,
p113
aVit was an extraordinary moment.
p114
aVThis picture is from literally a few seconds after
p115
aVthe baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.
p116
aVAnd you can see, our eyes were glistening.
p117
aVI was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,
p118
aVwith deep, deep gratitude
p119
aVthat we had what appeared to be a healthy child.
p120
aVAnd it was also, of course, surreal.
p121
aVI mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.
p122
aVI was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?"
p123
aVAnd this was all quite remarkable.
p124
aVBut what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,
p125
aVbut nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd so we've done something here
p128
aVthat is heretical.
p129
aVWe have charted
p130
aVour love for our child over time.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVThis, as you know, is an act of heresy.
p133
aVYou're not allowed to chart love.
p134
aVThe reason you're not allowed to chart love
p135
aVis because we think of love as a binary thing.
p136
aVYou're either in love, or you're not in love.
p137
aVYou love, or you don't love.
p138
aVAnd I think the reality is that love is a process,
p139
aVand I think the problem with thinking of love
p140
aVas something that's binary
p141
aVis that it causes us
p142
aVto be unduly concerned
p143
aVthat love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.
p144
aVAnd I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.
p145
aVBut I think a lot of men do go through this sense
p146
aVin the early months, maybe their first year,
p147
aVthat their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.
p148
aa(lp149
VAV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up,
p150
aVbecause you can notice where he dips in the first years
p151
aVwhere I think I was doing most of the work.
p152
aVBut we like to joke,
p153
aVin the first few months of all of our children's lives,
p154
aVthis is Uncle Rufus.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VRG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.
p158
aa(lp159
VAV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home
p160
aVthat I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up
p161
aVamongst other babies.
p162
aVSo I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.
p163
aa(lp164
VRG: Uh oh.
p165
aa(lp166
VAV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.
p167
aa(lp168
VRG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?
p169
aa(lp170
VAV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here,
p171
aVand I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.
p172
aa(lp173
VRG: The far left. AV: No!
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VRG: Cruel.
p178
aa(lp179
VAV: Nothing more to be said.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VI'll move on to taboo number two.
p184
aVYou can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.
p185
aVI enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.
p186
aVI felt incredibly connected to the community around me.
p187
aVI felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,
p188
aVtracking it down till the actual due-date.
p189
aVI felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.
p190
aVThat continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.
p191
aVI was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.
p192
aVIt was a really wonderful experience,
p193
aVbut when I got home,
p194
aVI suddenly felt very disconnected
p195
aVand suddenly shut in and shut out,
p196
aVand I was really surprised by those feelings.
p197
aVI did expect it to be difficult,
p198
aVhave sleepless nights, constant feedings,
p199
aVbut I did not expect the feelings
p200
aVof isolation and loneliness that I experienced,
p201
aVand I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,
p202
aVthat I was going to be feeling this way.
p203
aVAnd I called my sister
p204
aVwhom I'm very close to \u2014 and had three children \u2014
p205
aVand I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me
p206
aVI was going to be feeling this way,
p207
aVthat I was going to have these \u2014 feeling incredibly isolated?"
p208
aVAnd she said \u2014 I'll never forget \u2014
p209
aV"It's just not something you want to say to a mother
p210
aVthat's having a baby for the first time."
p211
aa(lp212
VRG: And of course, we think
p213
aVit's precisely what you really should be saying
p214
aVto mothers who have kids for the first time.
p215
aVAnd that this, of course, one of the themes for us
p216
aVis that we think
p217
aVthat candor and brutal honesty
p218
aVis critical to us collectively
p219
aVbeing great parents.
p220
aVAnd it's hard not to think
p221
aVthat part of what leads to this sense of isolation
p222
aVis our modern world.
p223
aVSo Alisa's experience is not isolated.
p224
aVSo your 58 percent of mothers surveyed
p225
aVreport feelings of loneliness.
p226
aVOf those, 67 percent are most lonely
p227
aVwhen their kids are zero to five \u2014 probably really zero to two.
p228
aVIn the process of preparing this,
p229
aVwe looked at how some other cultures around the world
p230
aVdeal with this period of time,
p231
aVbecause here in the Western world,
p232
aVless than 50 percent of us live near our family members,
p233
aVwhich I think is part of why this is such a tough period.
p234
aVSo to take one example among many:
p235
aVin Southern India
p236
aVthere's a practice known as jholabhari,
p237
aVin which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,
p238
aVmoves in with her mother
p239
aVand goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,
p240
aVgive birth and returns home to her nuclear family
p241
aVseveral months after the child is born.
p242
aVAnd this is one of many ways
p243
aVthat we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.
p244
aa(lp245
VAV: So taboo number three:
p246
aVyou can't talk about your miscarriage \u2014 but today I'll talk about mine.
p247
aVSo after we had Declan,
p248
aVwe kind of recalibrated our expectations.
p249
aVWe thought we actually could go through this again
p250
aVand thought we knew what we would be up against.
p251
aVAnd we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,
p252
aVand I soon learned that we were having a boy,
p253
aVand then when I was five months,
p254
aVwe learned that we had lost our child.
p255
aVThis is actually the last little image we have of him.
p256
aVAnd it was obviously a very difficult time \u2014
p257
aVreally painful.
p258
aVAs I was working through that mourning process,
p259
aVI was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.
p260
aVI really wanted to crawl into a hole,
p261
aVand I didn't really know how I was going
p262
aVto work my way back into my surrounding community.
p263
aVAnd I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,
p264
aVis on a really deep gut level,
p265
aVI was feeling a lot of shame
p266
aVand embarrassed, frankly,
p267
aVthat, in some respects, I had failed
p268
aVat delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.
p269
aVAnd of course, it made me question,
p270
aVif I wasn't able to have another child,
p271
aVwhat would that mean for my marriage,
p272
aVand just me as a woman.
p273
aVSo it was a very difficult time.
p274
aVAs I started working through it more,
p275
aVI started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.
p276
aVI was really amazed
p277
aVby all the stories that started flooding in.
p278
aVPeople I interacted with daily,
p279
aVworked with, was friends with,
p280
aVfamily members that I had known a long time,
p281
aVhad never shared with me their own stories.
p282
aVAnd I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,
p283
aVand I felt like I happened upon
p284
aVthis secret society of women that I now was a part of,
p285
aVwhich was reassuring and also really concerning.
p286
aVAnd I think,
p287
aVmiscarriage is an invisible loss.
p288
aVThere's not really a lot of community support around it.
p289
aVThere's really no ceremony,
p290
aVrituals, or rites.
p291
aVAnd I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,
p292
aVand there's a lot of community support,
p293
aVand it's something women don't have with miscarriage.
p294
aa(lp295
VRG: Which is too bad because, of course,
p296
aVit's a very common and very traumatic experience.
p297
aVFifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,
p298
aVand I find this astounding.
p299
aVIn a survey, 74 percent of women said
p300
aVthat miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.
p301
aVAnd astoundingly, 22 percent
p302
aVsaid they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo taboo number four:
p305
aVyou can't say that your average happiness
p306
aVhas declined since having a child.
p307
aVThe party line is that every single aspect of my life
p308
aVhas just gotten dramatically better
p309
aVever since I participated
p310
aVin the miracle that is childbirth and family.
p311
aVI'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,
p312
aVour first son, Declan, was nine months old,
p313
aVand I was sitting there on the couch,
p314
aVand I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness."
p315
aVAnd I got about two-thirds of the way through,
p316
aVand there was a chart on the right-hand side \u2014
p317
aVon the right-hand page \u2014
p318
aVthat we've labeled here
p319
aV"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable
p320
aVfor a New Parent."
p321
aVThis chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.
p322
aVBasically, there's this precipitous drop
p323
aVof marital satisfaction,
p324
aVwhich is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,
p325
aVthat doesn't rise again
p326
aVuntil your first child goes to college.
p327
aVSo I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,
p328
aVthis chasm of happiness
p329
aVthat we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.
p330
aVWe were despondent.
p331
aa(lp332
VAV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult,
p333
aVbut we'd come out of it,
p334
aVand were really shocked to see this study.
p335
aVSo we really wanted to take a deeper look at it
p336
aVin hopes that we would find a silver lining.
p337
aa(lp338
VRG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents,
p339
aVbecause we got this incredible reporter
p340
aVto go and interview all the scientists
p341
aVwho conducted these four studies.
p342
aVWe said, something is wrong here.
p343
aVThere's something missing from these studies.
p344
aVIt can't possibly be that bad.
p345
aVSo Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,
p346
aVand she interviewed four scientists,
p347
aVand she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,
p348
aVand we did indeed find a silver lining.
p349
aVSo this is our guess
p350
aVas to what this baseline of average happiness
p351
aVarguably looks like throughout life.
p352
aVAverage happiness is, of course, inadequate,
p353
aVbecause it doesn't speak
p354
aVto the moment-by-moment experience,
p355
aVand so this is what we think it looks like
p356
aVwhen you layer in
p357
aVmoment-to-moment experience.
p358
aVAnd so we all remember as children,
p359
aVthe tiniest little thing \u2014 and we see it on the faces of our children \u2014
p360
aVthe teeniest little thing
p361
aVcan just rocket them to these heights
p362
aVof just utter adulation,
p363
aVand then the next teeniest little thing
p364
aVcan cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.
p365
aVAnd it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.
p366
aVAnd then, of course, as you get older,
p367
aVit's almost like age is a form of lithium.
p368
aa(lp369
VAs you get older, you become more stable.
p370
aVAnd part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,
p371
aVis you start to learn to hedge your happiness.
p372
aVYou start to realize that
p373
aV"Hey, I could go to this live music event
p374
aVand have an utterly transforming experience
p375
aVthat will cover my entire body with goosebumps,
p376
aVbut it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic
p377
aVand I won't be able to get a beer.
p378
aVSo I'm not going to go.
p379
aVI've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go."
p380
aVSo your average happiness goes up,
p381
aVbut you lose those transcendent moments.
p382
aa(lp383
VAV: Yeah, and then you have your first child,
p384
aVand then you really resubmit yourself
p385
aVto these highs and lows \u2014
p386
aVthe highs being the first steps, the first smile,
p387
aVyour child reading to you for the first time \u2014
p388
aVthe lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night.
p389
aVBut you realize you resubmit yourself
p390
aVto losing control in a really wonderful way,
p391
aVwhich we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives
p392
aVand is quite gratifying.
p393
aa(lp394
VRG: And so in effect,
p395
aVwe trade average happiness.
p396
aVWe trade the sort of security and safety
p397
aVof a certain level of contentment
p398
aVfor these transcendent moments.
p399
aVSo where does that leave the two of us
p400
aVas a family with our three little boys
p401
aVin the thick of all this?
p402
aVThere's another factor in our case.
p403
aVWe have violated yet another taboo
p404
aVin our own lives,
p405
aVand this is a bonus taboo.
p406
aa(lp407
VAV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together,
p408
aVespecially with three children \u2014
p409
aVand we are.
p410
aa(lp411
VRG: And we had reservations about this on the front end.
p412
aVEverybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse.
p413
aVIn fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble,
p414
aVthe venture capitalists said,
p415
aV"We categorically don't invest
p416
aVin companies founded by husbands and wives,
p417
aVbecause there's an extra point of failure.
p418
aVIt's a bad idea. Don't do it."
p419
aVAnd we obviously went forward. We did.
p420
aVWe raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did,
p421
aVbecause in this phase of one's life,
p422
aVthe incredibly scarce resource is time.
p423
aVAnd if you're really passionate about what you do every day \u2014 which we are \u2014
p424
aVand you're also passionate about your relationship,
p425
aVthis is the only way we know how to do it.
p426
aVAnd so the final question that we would ask is:
p427
aVcan we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards?
p428
aVIt's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy,
p429
aVbut they're sometimes pretty quick.
p430
aVAnd so how about that average baseline of happiness?
p431
aVCan we move that up a little bit?
p432
aa(lp433
VAV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about,
p434
aVis really the result of walking into parenting \u2014
p435
aVand really any long-term partnership for that matter \u2014
p436
aVwith the wrong expectations.
p437
aVAnd if you have the right expectations and expectation management,
p438
aVwe feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience.
p439
aa(lp440
VRG: And so this is what \u2014
p441
aVAnd we think that a lot of parents,
p442
aVwhen you get in there \u2014 in our case anyway \u2014
p443
aVyou pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go.
p444
aVGet out of the airplane,
p445
aVit turns out you're trekking in Nepal.
p446
aVAnd trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience,
p447
aVparticularly if you pack your bags properly
p448
aVand you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched.

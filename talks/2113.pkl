VI experienced my first coup d'état at the age of four.
p5
aVBecause of the coup d'état,
p6
aVmy family had to leave my native home of Ghana
p7
aVand move to the Gambia.
p8
aVAs luck would have it,
p9
aVsix months after we arrived,
p10
aVthey too had a military coup.
p11
aVI vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night
p12
aVand gathering the few belongings we could
p13
aVand walking for about two hours
p14
aVto a safe house.
p15
aVFor a week, we slept under our beds
p16
aVbecause we were worried that bullets might fly through the window.
p17
aa(lp18
VThen, at the age of eight,
p19
aVwe moved to Botswana.
p20
aVThis time, it was different.
p21
aVThere were no coups.
p22
aVEverything worked. Great education.
p23
aVThey had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had
p24
aVa fiber-optic telephone system,
p25
aVlong before it had reached Western countries.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe only thing they didn't have
p28
aVis that they didn't have
p29
aVtheir own national television station,
p30
aVand so I remember watching
p31
aVTV from neighboring South Africa,
p32
aVand watching Nelson Mandela in jail
p33
aVbeing offered a chance to come out
p34
aVif he would give up the apartheid struggle.
p35
aVBut he didn't. He refused to do that
p36
aVuntil he actually achieved his objective
p37
aVof freeing South Africa from apartheid.
p38
aVAnd I remember feeling how just one good leader
p39
aVcould make such a big difference in Africa.
p40
aa(lp41
VThen at the age of 12,
p42
aVmy family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe.
p43
aVInitially, this too was amazing:
p44
aVgrowing economy, excellent infrastructure,
p45
aVand it seemed like it was a model
p46
aVfor economic development in Africa.
p47
aVI graduated from high school in Zimbabwe
p48
aVand I went off to college.
p49
aa(lp50
VSix years later, I returned to the country.
p51
aVEverything was different.
p52
aVIt had shattered into pieces.
p53
aVMillions of people had emigrated,
p54
aVthe economy was in a shambles,
p55
aVand it seemed all of a sudden that 30 years
p56
aVof development had been wiped out.
p57
aVHow could a country go so bad so fast?
p58
aVMost people would agree
p59
aVthat it's all because of leadership.
p60
aVOne man, President Robert Mugabe,
p61
aVis almost single-handedly responsible
p62
aVfor having destroyed this country.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, all these experiences of living in different
p65
aVparts of Africa growing up
p66
aVdid two things to me.
p67
aVThe first is it made me fall in love with Africa.
p68
aVEverywhere I went,
p69
aVI experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent
p70
aVand saw the resilience and the spirit of our people,
p71
aVand at the time, I realized that I wanted to dedicate
p72
aVthe rest of my life to making this continent great.
p73
aVBut I also realized that making Africa great
p74
aVwould require addressing this issue of leadership.
p75
aVYou see, all these countries I lived in,
p76
aVthe coups d'état
p77
aVand the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia
p78
aVand in Zimbabwe,
p79
aVcontrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen
p80
aVin Botswana and in South  Africa of good leadership.
p81
aVIt made me realize that Africa would rise or fall
p82
aVbecause of the quality of our leaders.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, one might think, of course,
p85
aVleadership matters everywhere.
p86
aVBut if there's one thing you take away from my talk today, it is this:
p87
aVIn Africa, more than anywhere else in the world,
p88
aVthe difference that just one good leader can make
p89
aVis much greater than anywhere  else, and here's why.
p90
aVIt's because in Africa, we have weak institutions,
p91
aVlike the judiciary, the constitution,
p92
aVcivil society and so forth.
p93
aVSo here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in:
p94
aVWhen societies have strong institutions,
p95
aVthe difference that one good leader can make is limited,
p96
aVbut when you have weak institutions,
p97
aVthen just one good leader
p98
aVcan make or break that country.
p99
aa(lp100
VLet me make it a bit more concrete.
p101
aVYou become the president of the United States.
p102
aVYou think, "Wow, I've arrived.
p103
aVI'm the most powerful man in the world."
p104
aVSo you decide, perhaps let me pass a law.
p105
aVAll of a sudden, Congress taps you on the shoulder
p106
aVand says, "No, no, no, no, no, you can't do that."
p107
aVYou say, "Let me try this way."
p108
aVThe Senate comes and says, "Uh-uh,
p109
aVwe don't think you can do that."
p110
aVYou say, perhaps, "Let me print some money.
p111
aVI think the economy needs a stimulus."
p112
aVThe central bank governor will think you're crazy.
p113
aVYou might get impeached for that.
p114
aVBut if you become the president of Zimbabwe,
p115
aVand you say, "You know, I really like this job.
p116
aVI think I'd like to stay in it forever." (Laughter)
p117
aVWell, you just can.
p118
aVYou decide you want to print money.
p119
aVYou call the central bank governor and you say,
p120
aV"Please double the money supply."
p121
aVHe'll say, "Okay, yes, sir,
p122
aVis there anything else I can do for you?"
p123
aVThis is the power that African leaders have,
p124
aVand this is why they make the most difference
p125
aVon the continent.
p126
aa(lp127
VThe good news is that
p128
aVthe quality of leadership in Africa has been improving.
p129
aVWe've had three generations  of leaders, in my mind.
p130
aVGeneration one are those who appeared
p131
aVin the '50s and '60s.
p132
aVThese are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana
p133
aVand Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.
p134
aVThe legacy they left is that they brought independence to Africa.
p135
aVThey freed us from colonialism,
p136
aVand let's give them credit for that.
p137
aVThey were followed by generation two.
p138
aVThese are people that brought nothing
p139
aVbut havoc to Africa.
p140
aVThink warfare, corruption, human rights abuses.
p141
aVThis is the stereotype of  the typical African leader
p142
aVthat we typically think of:
p143
aVMobutu Sese Seko from Zaire,
p144
aVSani Abacha from Nigeria.
p145
aVThe good news is that most of these leaders have moved on,
p146
aVand they were replaced by generation three.
p147
aVThese are people like the late Nelson Mandela
p148
aVand most of the leaders that we see in Africa today,
p149
aVlike Paul Kagame and so forth.
p150
aVNow these leaders are by no means perfect,
p151
aVbut the one thing they have done is that they have
p152
aVcleaned up much of the mess of generation two.
p153
aVThey've stopped the fighting,
p154
aVand I call them the stabilizer generation.
p155
aVThey're much more accountable to their people,
p156
aVthey've improved macroeconomic policies,
p157
aVand we are seeing for the first time
p158
aVAfrica's growing, and in  fact it's the second fastest
p159
aVgrowing economic region in the world.
p160
aVSo these leaders are by no means perfect,
p161
aVbut they are by and large
p162
aVthe best leaders we've seen in the last 50 years.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo where to from here?
p165
aVI believe that the next generation
p166
aVto come after this, generation four,
p167
aVhas a unique opportunity
p168
aVto transform the continent.
p169
aVSpecifically, they can do two things
p170
aVthat previous generations have not done.
p171
aVThe first thing they need to do
p172
aVis they need to create prosperity for the continent.
p173
aVWhy is prosperity so important?
p174
aVBecause none of the previous generations
p175
aVhave been able to tackle this issue of poverty.
p176
aVAfrica today
p177
aVhas the fastest growing population in the world,
p178
aVbut also is the poorest.
p179
aVBy 2030, Africa will have a larger workforce than China,
p180
aVand by 2050, it will have the largest workforce in the world.
p181
aVOne billion people will need jobs in Africa,
p182
aVso if we don't grow our economies fast enough,
p183
aVwe're sitting on a ticking time bomb,
p184
aVnot just for Africa but for the entire world.
p185
aa(lp186
VLet me show you an example
p187
aVof one person who is living up to this legacy
p188
aVof creating prosperity: Laetitia.
p189
aVLaetitia's a young woman from Kenya
p190
aVwho at the age of 13 had to drop out of school
p191
aVbecause her family couldn't  afford to pay fees for her.
p192
aVSo she started her own business rearing rabbits,
p193
aVwhich happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya
p194
aVthat she's from.
p195
aVThis business did so well that within a year,
p196
aVshe was employing 15 women
p197
aVand was able to generate enough income
p198
aVthat she was able to send herself to school,
p199
aVand through these women
p200
aVfund another 65 children to go to school.
p201
aVThe profits that she generated,
p202
aVshe used that to build a school,
p203
aVand today she educates
p204
aV400 children in her community.
p205
aVAnd she's just turned 18.
p206
aV(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
VAnother example is Erick Rajaonary.
p209
aVErick comes from the island of Madagascar.
p210
aVNow, Erick realized that agriculture
p211
aVwould be the key to creating jobs
p212
aVin the rural areas of Madagascar,
p213
aVbut he also realized that fertilizer was a very
p214
aVexpensive input for most farmers in Madagascar.
p215
aVMadagascar has these very special bats
p216
aVthat produce these droppings
p217
aVthat are very high in nutrients.
p218
aVIn 2006, Erick quit his job  as a chartered accountant
p219
aVand started a company to manufacture
p220
aVfertilizer from the bat droppings.
p221
aVToday, Erick has built a business
p222
aVthat generates several million dollars of revenue,
p223
aVand he employs 70 people full time
p224
aVand another 800 people during the season
p225
aVwhen the bats drop their droppings the most.
p226
aVNow, what I like about this story
p227
aVis that it shows that opportunities  to create prosperity
p228
aVcan be found almost anywhere.
p229
aVErick is known as the Batman.
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aVAnd who would have thought that you would have
p232
aVbeen able to build a multimillion-dollar business
p233
aVemploying so many people just from bat poo?
p234
aVThe second thing that this generation needs to do
p235
aVis to create our institutions.
p236
aVThey need to build these institutions such that we
p237
aVare never held to ransom again
p238
aVby a few individuals like Robert Mugabe.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, all of this sounds great,
p241
aVbut where are we going to get this generation four from?
p242
aVDo we just sit and hope that they emerge
p243
aVby chance, or that God gives them to us?
p244
aVNo, I don't think so.
p245
aVIt's too important an issue  for us to leave it to chance.
p246
aVI believe that we need to create African institutions,
p247
aVhome-grown, that will identify and develop
p248
aVthese leaders in a systematic, practical way.
p249
aVWe've been doing this for the last 10 years
p250
aVthrough the African Leadership Academy.
p251
aVLaetitia is one of our young leaders.
p252
aVToday, we have 700 of them  that are being groomed
p253
aVfor the African continent,
p254
aVand over the next 50 years,
p255
aVwe expect to create 6,000 of them.
p256
aa(lp257
VBut one thing has been troubling me.
p258
aVWe would get about 4,000 applications a year
p259
aVfor 100 young leaders that we could take
p260
aVinto this academy,
p261
aVand so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed
p262
aVfor this leadership training that we're offering.
p263
aVBut we couldn't satisfy it.
p264
aVSo today, I'm announcing for the first time in public
p265
aVan extension to this vision for the African Leadership Academy.
p266
aVWe're building 25 brand new universities in Africa
p267
aVthat are going to cultivate this next generation
p268
aVof African leaders.
p269
aVEach campus will have 10,000 leaders at a time
p270
aVso we'll be educating and developing
p271
aV250,000 leaders at any given time.
p272
aV(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VOver the next 50 years, this institution
p275
aVwill create three million transformative leaders
p276
aVfor the continent.
p277
aa(lp278
VMy hope is that half of them
p279
aVwill become the entrepreneurs that we need,
p280
aVwho will create these jobs that we need,
p281
aVand the other half
p282
aVwill go into government
p283
aVand the nonprofit sector,
p284
aVand they will build the institutions that we need.
p285
aVBut they won't just learn academics.
p286
aVThey will also learn how to become leaders,
p287
aVand they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs.
p288
aVSo think of this as Africa's Ivy League,
p289
aVbut instead of getting admitted because of your SAT scores
p290
aVor because of how much money you have
p291
aVor which family you come from,
p292
aVthe main criteria for getting into this university
p293
aVwill be what is the potential that you have
p294
aVfor transforming Africa?
p295
aa(lp296
VBut what we're doing is  just one group of institutions.
p297
aVWe cannot transform Africa by ourselves.
p298
aVMy hope
p299
aVis that many, many other home-grown
p300
aVAfrican institutions will blossom,
p301
aVand these institutions will all come together
p302
aVwith a common vision of developing
p303
aVthis next generation of African leaders,
p304
aVgeneration four,
p305
aVand they will teach them this common message:
p306
aVcreate jobs, build our institutions.
p307
aa(lp308
VNelson Mandela once said,
p309
aV"Every now and then,
p310
aVa generation is called upon to be great.
p311
aVYou can be that great generation."
p312
aVI believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate
p313
aVthe next generation of African leaders,
p314
aVthen this generation four that is coming up
p315
aVwill be the greatest generation that Africa
p316
aVand indeed the entire world has ever seen.
p317
aa(lp318
VThank you.

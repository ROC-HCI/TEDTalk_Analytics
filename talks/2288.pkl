VEvery group of female friends has the funny one,
p5
aVthe one you go to when you need a good cry,
p6
aVthe one who tells you to suck it up when you've had a hard day.
p7
aVAnd this group was no different.
p8
aVExcept that this was a community of groundbreaking women
p9
aVwho came together \u2014
p10
aVfirst to become teammates, then friends, and then family \u2014
p11
aVin the least likely of places:
p12
aVon the Special Operations battlefield.
p13
aVThis was a group of women whose friendship and valor was cemented
p14
aVnot only by what they had seen and done at the tip of the spear,
p15
aVbut by the fact that they were there
p16
aVat a time when women \u2014 officially, at least \u2014
p17
aVremained banned from ground combat,
p18
aVand America had no idea they existed.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis story begins with Special Operations leaders,
p21
aVsome of the most tested men in the United States military, saying,
p22
aV"We need women to help us wage this war."
p23
aV"America would never kill its way to the end of its wars," it argued.
p24
aV"Needed more knowledge and more understanding."
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd as everyone knows,
p27
aVif you want to understand what's happening in a community and in a home,
p28
aVyou talk to women,
p29
aVwhether you're talking about Southern Afghanistan,
p30
aVor Southern California.
p31
aVBut in this case, men could not talk to women,
p32
aVbecause in a conservative and traditional society like Afghanistan,
p33
aVthat would cause grave offense.
p34
aVSo you needed women soldiers out there.
p35
aVThat meant, at this time in the war, that the women who would be recruited
p36
aVto serve alongside Army Rangers and Navy SEALs,
p37
aVwould be seeing the kind of combat experienced by less than five percent
p38
aVof the entire United States military.
p39
aVLess than five percent.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo the call went out.
p42
aV"Female soldiers: Become a part of history.
p43
aVJoin Special Operations on the battlefield in Afghanistan."
p44
aVThis is in 2011.
p45
aVAnd from Alabama to Alaska,
p46
aVa group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered
p47
aValongside the best of the best,
p48
aVand to make a difference for their country,
p49
aVanswered that call to serve.
p50
aVAnd for them it was not about politics, it was about serving with purpose.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd so, the women who came to North Carolina
p53
aVto compete for a spot on these teams
p54
aVwhich would put women on the Special Operations front lines,
p55
aVlanded and found very quickly a community,
p56
aVthe likes of which they had never seen.
p57
aVFull of women who were as fierce and as fit as they were,
p58
aVand as driven to make a difference.
p59
aVThey didn't have to apologize for who they were,
p60
aVand in fact, they could celebrate it.
p61
aVAnd what they found when they were there was that all of a sudden,
p62
aVthere were lots of people like them.
p63
aVAs one of them said,
p64
aV"It was like you looked around and realized
p65
aVthere was more than one giraffe at the zoo."
p66
aa(lp67
VAmong this team of standouts was Cassie,
p68
aVa young woman who managed to be an ROTC cadet, a sorority sister
p69
aVand a Women's Studies minor, all in one person.
p70
aVTristan, a West Point track star, who always ran and road marched
p71
aVwith no socks,
p72
aVand had shoes whose smell proved it.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVAmber, a Heidi look-alike, who had always wanted to be in the infantry,
p75
aVand when she found out that women couldn't be,
p76
aVshe decided to become an intel officer.
p77
aVShe served in Bosnia,
p78
aVand later helped the FBI to bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania.
p79
aVAnd then there was Kate, who played high school football
p80
aVall four years,
p81
aVand actually wanted to drop out after the first,
p82
aVto go into the glee club,
p83
aVbut when boys told her that girls couldn't play football,
p84
aVshe decided to stay
p85
aVfor all the little girls who would come after her.
p86
aa(lp87
VFor them, biology had shaped part of their destiny,
p88
aVand put, as Cassie once said,
p89
aV"everything noble out of reach for girls."
p90
aVAnd yet, here was a chance to serve with the best of the best
p91
aVon a mission that mattered to their country,
p92
aVnot despite the fact that they were female,
p93
aVbut because of it.
p94
aa(lp95
VThis team of women, in many ways, was like women everywhere.
p96
aVThey wore makeup, and in fact,
p97
aVthey would bond in the ladies' room over eyeliner and eye pencil.
p98
aVThey also wore body armor.
p99
aVThey would put 50 pounds of weight on their backs,
p100
aVand board the helicopter for an operation,
p101
aVand they would come back and watch a movie called "Bridesmaids."
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVThey even wore a thing called Spanx,
p104
aVbecause, as they found very quickly,
p105
aVthe uniforms made for men were big where they should be small,
p106
aVand small where they should be big.
p107
aVSo Lane, an Iraq War veteran \u2014 you see her here on my left \u2014
p108
aVdecided she was going to go on Amazon
p109
aVand order a pair of Spanx to her base,
p110
aVso that her pants would fit better when she went out on mission each night.
p111
aa(lp112
VThese women would get together over video conference
p113
aVfrom all around Afghanistan from their various bases,
p114
aVand they would talk about what it was like
p115
aVto be one of the only women doing what they were doing.
p116
aVThey would swap jokes,
p117
aVthey would talk about what was working, what wasn't,
p118
aVwhat they had learned to do well, what they needed to do better.
p119
aVAnd they would talk about some of the lighter moments of being women
p120
aVout on the Special Operations front lines,
p121
aVincluding the Shewee,
p122
aVwhich was a tool that let you pee like a guy,
p123
aValthough it's said to have had only a 40 percent accuracy rate out there.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VThese women lived in the "and."
p127
aVThey proved you could be fierce and you could be feminine.
p128
aVYou could wear mascara and body armor.
p129
aVYou could love CrossFit, and really like cross-stitch.
p130
aVYou could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies.
p131
aVWomen live in the and every single day,
p132
aVand these women brought that to this mission as well.
p133
aVOn this life and death battlefield they never forgot
p134
aVthat being female may have brought them to the front lines,
p135
aVbut being a soldier is what would prove themselves there.
p136
aa(lp137
VThere was the night Amber went out on mission,
p138
aVand in talking to the women of the house,
p139
aVrealized that there was a barricaded shooter lying in wait
p140
aVfor the Afghan and American forces who were waiting to enter the home.
p141
aVAnother night it was Tristan who found out
p142
aVthat there were pieces that make up explosives
p143
aVall around the house in which they were standing,
p144
aVand that in fact, explosives lay all the way between there
p145
aVand where they were about to head that night.
p146
aVThere was the night another one of their teammates proved herself
p147
aVto a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs,
p148
aVwhen she found the intel item they were looking for
p149
aVwrapped up in a baby's wet diaper.
p150
aVAnd there was the night that Isabel, another one of their teammates,
p151
aVfound the things that they were looking for,
p152
aVand received an Impact Award from the Rangers
p153
aVwho said that without her,
p154
aVthe things and the people they were looking for that night
p155
aVwould never have been found.
p156
aa(lp157
VThat night and so many others,
p158
aVthey went out to prove themselves, not only for one another,
p159
aVbut for everybody who would come after them.
p160
aVAnd also for the men alongside whom they served.
p161
aVWe talk a lot about how behind every great man is a good woman.
p162
aVAnd in this case,
p163
aVnext to these women stood men who wanted to see them succeed.
p164
aVThe Army Ranger who trained them had served 12 deployments.
p165
aVAnd when they told him that he had to go train girls,
p166
aVhe had no idea what to expect.
p167
aVBut at the end of eight days with these women in the summer of 2011,
p168
aVhe told his fellow Ranger, "We have just witnessed history.
p169
aVThese may well be our own Tuskegee Airmen."
p170
aV(Applause)
p171
aa(lp172
VAt the heart of this team was the one person
p173
aVwho everyone called "the best of us."
p174
aVShe was a petite blonde dynamo,
p175
aVwho barely reached five-foot-three.
p176
aVAnd she was this wild mix of Martha Stewart,
p177
aVand what we know as G.I. Jane.
p178
aVShe was someone who loved to make dinner for her husband,
p179
aVher Kent State ROTC sweetheart who pushed her to be her best,
p180
aVand to trust herself,
p181
aVand to test every limit she could.
p182
aVShe also loved to put 50 pounds of weight on her back and run for miles,
p183
aVand she loved to be a soldier.
p184
aVShe was somebody who had a bread maker in her office in Kandahar,
p185
aVand would bake a batch of raisin bread, and then go to the gym
p186
aVand bust out 25 or 30 pull-ups from a dead hang.
p187
aVShe was the person who, if you needed an extra pair of boots
p188
aVor a home-cooked dinner, would be on your speed dial.
p189
aVBecause she never, ever would talk to you
p190
aVabout how good she was,
p191
aVbut let her character speak through action.
p192
aVShe was famous for taking the hard right over the easy wrong.
p193
aVAnd she was also famous for walking up to a 15-foot rope,
p194
aVclimbing it using only her arms,
p195
aVand then shuffling away and apologizing,
p196
aVbecause she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs,
p197
aVas the Rangers had trained them.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VSome of our heroes return home to tell their stories.
p201
aVAnd some of them don't.
p202
aVAnd on October 22, 2011,
p203
aVFirst Lieutenant Ashley White was killed alongside two Rangers,
p204
aVChristopher Horns
p205
aVand Kristoffer Domeij.
p206
aVHer death threw this program built for the shadows
p207
aVinto a very public spotlight.
p208
aVBecause after all,
p209
aVthe ban on women in combat was still very much in place.
p210
aVAnd at her funeral,
p211
aVthe head of Army Special Operations came, and gave a public testimony
p212
aVnot just to the courage of Ashley White,
p213
aVbut to all her team of sisters.
p214
aV"Make no mistake about it," he said, "these women are warriors,
p215
aVand they have written a new chapter in what it means to be a female
p216
aVin the United States Army."
p217
aa(lp218
VAshley's mom is a teacher's aide and a school bus driver,
p219
aVwho bakes cookies on the side.
p220
aVShe doesn't remember much about that overwhelming set of days,
p221
aVin which grief \u2014 enormous grief \u2014
p222
aVmixed with pride.
p223
aVBut she does remember one moment.
p224
aVA stranger with a child in her hand came up to her
p225
aVand she said, "Mrs. White,
p226
aVI brought my daughter here today,
p227
aVbecause I wanted her to know what a hero was.
p228
aVAnd I wanted her to know that heroes could be women, too."
p229
aa(lp230
VIt is time to celebrate all the unsung heroines
p231
aVwho reach into their guts
p232
aVand find the heart and the grit to keep going and to test every limit.
p233
aVThis very unlikely band of sisters bound forever in life and afterward
p234
aVdid indeed become part of history,
p235
aVand they paved the way for so many who would come after them,
p236
aVas much as they stood on the shoulders of those who had come before.
p237
aVThese women showed that warriors come in all shapes and sizes.
p238
aVAnd women can be heroes, too.
p239
aVThank you so much.
p240
aV(Applause)

VSo yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist \u2014
p5
aVpolitical cartoonist.
p6
aVI don't know if you've heard about it \u2014 newspapers?
p7
aVIt's a sort of paper-based reader.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVIt's lighter than an iPad,
p10
aVit's a bit cheaper.
p11
aVYou know what they say?
p12
aVThey say the print media is dying \u2014
p13
aVwho says that? Well, the media.
p14
aVBut this is no news, right?
p15
aVYou've read about it already.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VLadies and gentlemen,
p20
aVthe world has gotten smaller.
p21
aVI know it's a cliche, but look,
p22
aVlook how small,
p23
aVhow tiny it has gotten.
p24
aVAnd you know the reason why, of course.
p25
aVThis is because of technology \u2014 yeah.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVAny computer designers in the room?
p28
aVYeah well,
p29
aVyou guys are making my life miserable
p30
aVbecause track pads used to be round,
p31
aVa nice round shape.
p32
aVThat makes a good cartoon.
p33
aVBut what are you going to do with a flat track pad,
p34
aVthose square things?
p35
aVThere's nothing I can do as a cartoonist.
p36
aVWell, I know the world is flat now.
p37
aVThat's true.
p38
aVAnd the Internet has reached
p39
aVevery corner of the world,
p40
aVthe poorest, the remotest places.
p41
aVEvery village in Africa now has a cyber cafe.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVDon't go asking for a Frappuccino there.
p44
aVSo we are bridging the digital divide.
p45
aVThe Third World is connected,
p46
aVwe are connected.
p47
aVAnd what happens next?
p48
aVWell, you've got mail.
p49
aVYeah.
p50
aVWell, the Internet has empowered us.
p51
aVIt has empowered you,
p52
aVit has empowered me
p53
aVand it has empowered some other guys as well.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VYou know, these last two cartoons \u2014
p58
aVI did them live
p59
aVduring a conference in Hanoi.
p60
aVAnd they were not used to that
p61
aVin communist 2.0 Vietnam.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVSo I was cartooning live on a wide screen \u2014
p64
aVit was quite a sensation \u2014
p65
aVand then this guy came to me.
p66
aVHe was taking pictures of me and of my sketches,
p67
aVand I thought, "This is great, a Vietnamese fan."
p68
aVAnd as he came the second day,
p69
aVI thought, "Wow, that's really a cartoon lover."
p70
aVAnd on the third day, I finally understood,
p71
aVthe guy was actually on duty.
p72
aVSo by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me
p73
aVsmiling with my sketches
p74
aVin the files of the Vietnamese police.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VNo, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.
p79
aVIt has rocked the music industry;
p80
aVit has changed the way we consume music.
p81
aVFor those of you old enough to remember,
p82
aVwe used to have to go to the store
p83
aVto steal it.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVAnd it has changed the way
p86
aVyour future employer
p87
aVwill look at your application.
p88
aVSo be careful
p89
aVwith that Facebook account \u2014
p90
aVyour momma told you, be careful.
p91
aVAnd technology has set us free \u2014
p92
aVthis is free WiFi.
p93
aVBut yeah, it has liberated us
p94
aVfrom the office desk.
p95
aVThis is your life,
p96
aVenjoy it.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVIn short, technology, the internet,
p99
aVthey have changed our lifestyle.
p100
aVTech guru, like this man \u2014
p101
aVthat a German magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century \u2014
p102
aVthey are shaping the way we do things.
p103
aVThey are shaping the way we consume.
p104
aVThey are shaping our very desires.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aV(Applause)
p107
aVYou will not like it.
p108
aVAnd technology has even changed
p109
aVour relationship to God.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VNow I shouldn't get into this.
p114
aVReligion and political cartoons,
p115
aVas you may have heard,
p116
aVmake a difficult couple,
p117
aVever since that day of 2005,
p118
aVwhen a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark
p119
aVdrew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world \u2014
p120
aVdemonstrations, fatwa,
p121
aVthey provoked violence. People died in the violence.
p122
aVThis was so sickening;
p123
aVpeople died because of cartoons.
p124
aVI mean \u2014
p125
aVI had the feeling at the time
p126
aVthat cartoons had been used by both sides, actually.
p127
aVThey were used first by a Danish newspaper,
p128
aVwhich wanted to make a point on Islam.
p129
aVA Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24
p130
aVwho received the assignment to draw the prophet \u2014
p131
aV12 of them refused. Did you know that?
p132
aVHe told me, "Nobody has to tell me what I should draw.
p133
aVThis is not how it works."
p134
aVAnd then, of course, they were used
p135
aVby extremists and politicians on the other side.
p136
aVThey wanted to stir up controversy.
p137
aVYou know the story.
p138
aVWe know that cartoons can be used as weapons.
p139
aVHistory tells us,
p140
aVthey've been used by the Nazis
p141
aVto attack the Jews.
p142
aVAnd here we are now.
p143
aVIn the United Nations,
p144
aVhalf of the world is pushing
p145
aVto penalize the offense to religion \u2014
p146
aVthey call it the defamation of religion \u2014
p147
aVwhile the other half of the world is fighting back
p148
aVin defense of freedom of speech.
p149
aVSo the clash of civilizations is here,
p150
aVand cartoons are at the middle of it?
p151
aVThis got me thinking.
p152
aVNow you see me thinking
p153
aVat my kitchen table,
p154
aVand since you're in my kitchen,
p155
aVplease meet my wife.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VIn 2006, a few months after,
p160
aVI went Ivory Coast \u2014
p161
aVWestern Africa.
p162
aVNow, talk of a divided place \u2014 the country was cut in two.
p163
aVYou had a rebellion in the North,
p164
aVthe government in the South \u2014 the capital, Abidjan \u2014
p165
aVand in the middle, the French army.
p166
aVThis looks like a giant hamburger.
p167
aVYou don't want to be the ham in the middle.
p168
aVI was there to report on that story
p169
aVin cartoons.
p170
aVI've been doing this for the last 15 years;
p171
aVit's my side job, if you want.
p172
aVSo you see the style is different.
p173
aVThis is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.
p174
aVI went to places like Gaza
p175
aVduring the war in 2009.
p176
aVSo this is really journalism in cartoons.
p177
aVYou'll hear more and more about it.
p178
aVThis is the future of journalism, I think.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd of course, I went to see the rebels in the north.
p181
aVThose were poor guys fighting for their rights.
p182
aVThere was an ethnic side to this conflict
p183
aVas very often in Africa.
p184
aVAnd I went to see the Dozo.
p185
aVThe Dozo, they are the traditional hunters
p186
aVof West Africa.
p187
aVPeople fear them \u2014
p188
aVthey help the rebellion a lot.
p189
aVThey are believed to have magical powers.
p190
aVThey can disappear and escape bullets.
p191
aVI went to see a Dozo chief;
p192
aVhe told me about his magical powers.
p193
aVHe said, "I can chop your head off right away
p194
aVand bring you back to life."
p195
aVI said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now."
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aV"Another time."
p198
aa(lp199
VSo back in Abidjan,
p200
aVI was given a chance to lead a workshop
p201
aVwith local cartoonists there
p202
aVand I thought, yes,
p203
aVin a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons
p204
aVagainst the other side.
p205
aVI mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided \u2014
p206
aVit was compared to the media in Rwanda
p207
aVbefore the genocide \u2014
p208
aVso imagine.
p209
aVAnd what can a cartoonist do?
p210
aVSometimes editors would tell their cartoonists
p211
aVto draw what they wanted to see,
p212
aVand the guy has to feed his family, right?
p213
aVSo the idea was pretty simple.
p214
aVWe brought together cartoonists
p215
aVfrom all sides in Ivory Coast.
p216
aVWe took them away from their newspaper for three days.
p217
aVAnd I asked them to do a project together,
p218
aVtackle the issues affecting their country
p219
aVin cartoons, yes, in cartoons.
p220
aVShow the positive power of cartoons.
p221
aVIt's a great tool of communication
p222
aVfor bad or for good.
p223
aVAnd cartoons can cross boundaries,
p224
aVas you have seen.
p225
aVAnd humor is a good way, I think,
p226
aVto address serious issues.
p227
aVAnd I'm very proud of what they did.
p228
aVI mean, they didn't agree with each other \u2014 that was not the point.
p229
aVAnd I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.
p230
aVThe first day, they were even shouting at each other.
p231
aVBut they came up with a book,
p232
aVlooking back at 13 years
p233
aVof political crisis in Ivory Coast.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo the idea was there.
p236
aVAnd I've been doing projects like this,
p237
aVin 2009 in Lebanon,
p238
aVthis year in Kenya, back in January.
p239
aVIn Lebanon, it was not a book.
p240
aVThe idea was to have \u2014
p241
aVthe same principal, a divided country \u2014
p242
aVtake cartoonists from all sides
p243
aVand let them do something together.
p244
aVSo in Lebanon,
p245
aVwe enrolled the newspaper editors,
p246
aVand we got them to publish
p247
aVeight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page,
p248
aVaddressing the issue affecting Lebanon,
p249
aVlike religion in politics and everyday life.
p250
aVAnd it worked.
p251
aVFor three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut
p252
aVpublished all those cartoonists together \u2014
p253
aVanti-government,
p254
aVpro-government,
p255
aVChristian,
p256
aVMuslim, of course,
p257
aVEnglish-speaking, well, you name it.
p258
aVSo this was a great project.
p259
aVAnd then in Kenya, what we did
p260
aVwas addressing the issue of ethnicity,
p261
aVwhich is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.
p262
aVAnd we did video clips \u2014
p263
aVyou can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo, preaching for freedom of speech
p266
aVis easy here,
p267
aVbut as you have seen
p268
aVin contexts of repression or division,
p269
aVagain, what can a cartoonist do?
p270
aVHe has to keep his job.
p271
aVWell I believe that in any context anywhere,
p272
aVhe always has the choice at least
p273
aVnot to do a cartoon
p274
aVthat will feed hatred.
p275
aVAnd that's the message I try to convey to them.
p276
aVI think we all always have the choice in the end
p277
aVnot to do the bad thing.
p278
aVBut we need to support
p279
aVthese [unclear], critical
p280
aVand responsible voices
p281
aVin Africa, in Lebanon,
p282
aVin your local newspaper,
p283
aVin the Apple store.
p284
aVToday, tech companies
p285
aVare the world's largest editors.
p286
aVThey decide what is too offensive
p287
aVor too provocative for you to see.
p288
aVSo really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists;
p289
aVit's about your freedoms.
p290
aVAnd for dictators all over the world,
p291
aVthe good news
p292
aVis when cartoonists,
p293
aVjournalists and activists shut up.
p294
aa(lp295
VThank you.

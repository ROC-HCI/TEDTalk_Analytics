VDesign is a slippery and elusive phenomenon,
p5
aVwhich has meant different things at different times.
p6
aVBut all truly inspiring design projects have one thing in common:
p7
aVthey began with a dream.
p8
aVAnd the bolder the dream,
p9
aVthe greater the design feat that will be required to achieve it.
p10
aVAnd this is why the greatest designers are almost always
p11
aVthe biggest dreamers and rebels and renegades.
p12
aa(lp13
VThis has been the case throughout history,
p14
aVall the way back to the year 300 BC,
p15
aVwhen a 13-year-old became the king
p16
aVof a remote, very poor and very small Asian country.
p17
aVHe dreamt of acquiring land, riches and power
p18
aVthrough military conquest.
p19
aVAnd his design skills \u2014
p20
aVimprobable though it sounds \u2014
p21
aVwould be essential in enabling him to do so.
p22
aa(lp23
VAt the time,
p24
aVall weapons were made by hand to different specifications.
p25
aVSo if an archer ran out of arrows during a battle,
p26
aVthey wouldn't necessarily be able to fire another archer's arrows
p27
aVfrom their bow.
p28
aVThis of course meant that they would be less effective in combat
p29
aVand very vulnerable, too.
p30
aVYing solved this problem
p31
aVby insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically,
p32
aVso they were interchangeable.
p33
aVAnd he did the same for daggers, axes, spears, shields
p34
aVand every other form of weaponry.
p35
aVHis formidably equipped army won batter after battle,
p36
aVand within 15 years,
p37
aVhis tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering
p38
aVall its larger, richer, more powerful neighbors,
p39
aVto found the mighty Chinese Empire.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, no one, of course,
p42
aVwould have thought of describing Ying Zheng as a designer at the time \u2014
p43
aVwhy would they?
p44
aVAnd yet he used design unknowingly and instinctively
p45
aVbut with tremendous ingenuity
p46
aVto achieve his ends.
p47
aVAnd so did another equally improbable, accidental designer,
p48
aVwho was also not above using violence to get what he wanted.
p49
aVThis was Edward Teach, better known as the British pirate, Blackbeard.
p50
aa(lp51
VThis was the golden age of piracy,
p52
aVwhere pirates like Teach were terrorizing the high seas.
p53
aVColonial trade was flourishing,
p54
aVand piracy was highly profitable.
p55
aVAnd the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their spoils,
p56
aVthey needed to attack their enemies so brutally
p57
aVthat they would surrender on sight.
p58
aVSo in other words,
p59
aVthey could take the ships without wasting ammunition,
p60
aVor incurring casualties.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo Edward Teach redesigned himself as Blackbeard
p63
aVby playing the part of a merciless brute.
p64
aVHe wore heavy jackets and big hats to accentuate his height.
p65
aVHe grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face.
p66
aVHe slung braces of pistols on either shoulder.
p67
aVHe even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight,
p68
aVso they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack.
p69
aVAnd like many pirates of that era,
p70
aVhe flew a flag that bore the macabre symbols
p71
aVof a human skull and a pair of crossed bones,
p72
aVbecause those motifs had signified death in so many cultures for centuries,
p73
aVthat their meaning was instantly recognizable,
p74
aVeven in the lawless, illiterate world of the high seas:
p75
aVsurrender or you'll suffer.
p76
aVSo of course, all his sensible victims surrendered on sight.
p77
aa(lp78
VPut like that,
p79
aVit's easy to see why Edward Teach and his fellow pirates
p80
aVcould be seen as pioneers of modern communications design,
p81
aVand why their deadly symbol \u2014
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
Vthere's more \u2014
p86
aVwhy their deadly symbol of the skull and crossbones
p87
aVwas a precursor of today's logos,
p88
aVrather like the big red letters standing behind me,
p89
aVbut of course with a different message.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VYet design was also used to nobler ends
p94
aVby an equally brilliant and equally improbable designer,
p95
aVthe 19th-century British nurse, Florence Nightingale.
p96
aVHer mission was to provide decent healthcare for everyone.
p97
aVNightingale was born into a rather grand, very wealthy British family,
p98
aVwho were horrified when she volunteered to work in military hospitals
p99
aVduring the Crimean War.
p100
aVOnce there, she swiftly realized
p101
aVthat more patients were dying of infections that they caught there,
p102
aVin the filthy, fetid wards,
p103
aVthan they were of battle wounds.
p104
aVSo she campaigned for cleaner, lighter, airier clinics
p105
aVto be designed and built.
p106
aa(lp107
VBack in Britain,
p108
aVshe mounted another campaign,
p109
aVthis time for civilian hospitals,
p110
aVand insisted that the same design principles were applied to them.
p111
aVThe Nightingale ward, as it is called,
p112
aVdominated hospital design for decades to come,
p113
aVand elements of it are still used today.
p114
aVBut by then,
p115
aVdesign was seen as a tool of the Industrial Age.
p116
aVIt was formalized and professionalized,
p117
aVbut it was restricted to specific roles
p118
aVand generally applied in pursuit of commercial goals
p119
aVrather than being used intuitively,
p120
aVas Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard and Ying Zheng had done.
p121
aa(lp122
VBy the 20th century,
p123
aVthis commercial ethos was so powerful,
p124
aVthat any designers who deviated from it
p125
aVrisked being seen as cranks or subversives.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow among them is one of my great design heroes,
p128
aVthe brilliant László Moholy-Nagy.
p129
aVHe was the Hungarian artist and designer
p130
aVwhose experiments with the impact of technology on daily life
p131
aVwere so powerful
p132
aVthat they still influence the design of the digital images
p133
aVwe see on our phone and computer screens.
p134
aVHe radicalized the Bauhaus Design School in 1920s Germany,
p135
aVand yet some of his former colleagues shunned him
p136
aVwhen he struggled to open a new Bauhaus in Chicago years later.
p137
aVMoholy's ideas were as bold and incisive as ever,
p138
aVbut his approach to design was too experimental,
p139
aVas was his insistence on seeing it, as he put it,
p140
aVas an attitude, not a profession to be in tune with the times.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd sadly, the same applied
p143
aVto another design maverick: Richard Buckminster Fuller.
p144
aVHe was yet another brilliant design visionary
p145
aVand design activist,
p146
aVwho was completely committed to designing a sustainable society
p147
aVin such a forward-thinking way
p148
aVthat he started talking about the importance of environmentalism
p149
aVin design in the 1920s.
p150
aVNow he, despite his efforts,
p151
aVwas routinely mocked as a crank by many in the design establishment,
p152
aVand admittedly,
p153
aVsome of his experiments failed,
p154
aVlike the flying car that never got off the ground.
p155
aVAnd yet, the geodesic dome,
p156
aVhis design formula to build an emergency shelter
p157
aVfrom scraps of wood, metal, plastic,
p158
aVbits of tree, old blankets, plastic sheeting \u2014
p159
aVjust about anything that's available at the time \u2014
p160
aVis one of the greatest feats of humanitarian design,
p161
aVand has provided sorely needed refuge
p162
aVto many, many people in desperate circumstances
p163
aVever since.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, it was the courage and verve of radical designers
p166
aVlike Bucky and Moholy
p167
aVthat drew me to design.
p168
aVI began my career as a news journalist and foreign correspondent.
p169
aVI wrote about politics, economics and corporate affairs,
p170
aVand I could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields.
p171
aVBut I picked design,
p172
aVbecause I believe it's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal
p173
aVto improve our quality of life.
p174
aa(lp175
VThank you, fellow TED design buffs.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Applause)
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd greatly as I admire the achievements of professional designers,
p180
aVwhich have been extraordinary and immense,
p181
aVI also believe
p182
aVthat design benefits hugely from the originality,
p183
aVthe lateral thinking
p184
aVand the resourcefulness of its rebels and renegades.
p185
aVAnd we're living at a remarkable moment in design,
p186
aVbecause this is a time when the two camps are coming closer together.
p187
aVBecause even very basic advances in digital technology
p188
aVhave enabled them to operate increasingly independently,
p189
aVin or out of a commercial context,
p190
aVto pursue ever more ambitious and eclectic objectives.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo in theory,
p193
aVbasic platforms like crowdfunding, cloud computing, social media
p194
aVare giving greater freedom to professional designers
p195
aVand giving more resources for the improvisational ones,
p196
aVand hopefully,
p197
aVa more receptive response to their ideas.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, some of my favorite examples of this are in Africa,
p200
aVwhere a new generation of designers
p201
aVare developing incredible Internet of Things technologies
p202
aVto fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream of improving healthcare
p203
aVin countries where more people now have access to cell phones
p204
aVthan to clean, running water.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd among them is Arthur Zang.
p207
aVHe's a young, Cameroonian design engineer
p208
aVwho has a adapted a tablet computer into the Cardiopad,
p209
aVa mobile heart-monitoring device.
p210
aVIt can be used to monitor the hearts of patients in remote, rural areas.
p211
aVThe data is then sent on a cellular network
p212
aVto well-equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away
p213
aVfor analysis.
p214
aVAnd if any problems are spotted by the specialists there,
p215
aVa suitable course of treatment is recommended.
p216
aVAnd this of course saves many patients
p217
aVfrom making long, arduous, expensive and often pointless journeys
p218
aVto those hospitals,
p219
aVand makes it much, much likelier
p220
aVthat their hearts will actually be checked.
p221
aa(lp222
VArthur Zang started working on the Cardiopad eight years ago,
p223
aVin his final year at university.
p224
aVBut he failed to persuade any conventional sources
p225
aVto give him investment to get the project off the ground.
p226
aVHe posted the idea on Facebook,
p227
aVwhere a Cameroonian government official saw it
p228
aVand managed to secure a government grant for him.
p229
aVHe's now developing not only the Cardiopad,
p230
aVbut other mobile medical devices to treat different conditions.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd he isn't alone,
p233
aVbecause there are many other inspiring and enterprising designers
p234
aVwho are also pursuing extraordinary projects of their own.
p235
aVAnd I'm going to finish by looking at just a few of them.
p236
aVOne is Peek Vision.
p237
aVThis is a group of doctors and designers in Kenya,
p238
aVwho've developed an Internet of Things technology of their own,
p239
aVas a portable eye examination kit.
p240
aVThen there's Gabriel Maher,
p241
aVwho is developing a new design language
p242
aVto enable us to articulate the subtleties of our changing gender identities,
p243
aVwithout recourse to traditional stereotypes.
p244
aa(lp245
VAll of these designers and many more are pursuing their dreams,
p246
aVby the making the most of their newfound freedom,
p247
aVwith the discipline of professional designers
p248
aVand the resourcefulness of rebels and renegades.
p249
aVAnd we all stand to benefit.
p250
aa(lp251
VThank you.

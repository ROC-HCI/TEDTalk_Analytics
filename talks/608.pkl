VTake a look at this picture.
p5
aVIt poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.
p6
aVThese African students are doing their homework
p7
aVunder streetlights at the airport in the capital city
p8
aVbecause they don't have any electricity at home.
p9
aVNow, I haven't met these particular students,
p10
aVbut I've met students like them.
p11
aa(lp12
VLet's just pick one \u2014 for example, the one in the green shirt.
p13
aVLet's give him a name, too: Nelson.
p14
aVI'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.
p15
aVSo here is the puzzle.
p16
aVWhy is it that Nelson has access
p17
aVto a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,
p18
aVbut doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology
p19
aVfor generating electric light in the home?
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, in a word, the answer is "rules."
p22
aVBad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available
p23
aVwhen people can bring new technologies in
p24
aVand make them available to someone like Nelson.
p25
aVWhat kinds of rules?
p26
aVThe electric company in this nation
p27
aVoperates under a rule, which says that it has to sell
p28
aVelectricity at a very low, subsidized price \u2014
p29
aVin fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.
p30
aVSo it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,
p31
aVto hook up many other users.
p32
aa(lp33
VThe president wanted to change this rule.
p34
aVHe's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,
p35
aVrules where businesses earn a small profit,
p36
aVso they have an incentive to sign up more customers.
p37
aVThat's the kind of rules that the cellphone company
p38
aVthat Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.
p39
aVThe president has seen how those rules worked well.
p40
aVSo he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,
p41
aVbut ran into a firestorm of protest
p42
aVfrom businesses and consumers
p43
aVwho wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.
p44
aVSo he was stuck with rules that prevented him
p45
aVfrom letting the win-win solution help his country.
p46
aVAnd Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.
p47
aa(lp48
VThe real challenge then, is to try to figure out
p49
aVhow we can change rules.
p50
aVAre there some rules we can develop for changing rules?
p51
aVI want to argue that there is a general abstract insight
p52
aVthat we can make practical,
p53
aVwhich is that, if we can give more choices to people,
p54
aVand more choices to leaders \u2014
p55
aVwho, in many countries, are also people.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVBut, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.
p58
aVBecause the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,
p59
aVa choice like giving the president the choice
p60
aVto raise prices on electricity,
p61
aVtakes away a choice that people in the economy want.
p62
aVThey want the choice to be able to continue consuming
p63
aVsubsidized electric power.
p64
aVSo if you give just to one side or the other,
p65
aVyou'll have tension or friction.
p66
aVBut if we can find ways to give more choices to both,
p67
aVthat will give us a set of rules
p68
aVfor changing rules that get us out of traps.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, Nelson also has access to the Internet.
p71
aVAnd he says that if you want to see
p72
aVthe damaging effects of rules,
p73
aVthe ways that rules can keep people in the dark,
p74
aVlook at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.
p75
aVIn particular check out Asia.
p76
aVIf you zoom in here,
p77
aVyou can see North Korea, in outline here,
p78
aVwhich is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.
p79
aVNow, you won't be surprised to learn
p80
aVthat the rules in North Korea
p81
aVkeep people there in the dark.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut it is important to recognize
p84
aVthat North Korea and South Korea
p85
aVstarted out with identical sets of rules
p86
aVin both the sense of laws and regulations,
p87
aVbut also in the deeper senses of understandings,
p88
aVnorms, culture, values and beliefs.
p89
aVWhen they separated, they made choices
p90
aVthat led to very divergent paths
p91
aVfor their sets of rules.
p92
aVSo we can change \u2014 we as humans can change the rules
p93
aVthat we use to interact with each other,
p94
aVfor better, or for worse.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow let's look at another region, the Caribbean.
p97
aVZoom in on Haiti,
p98
aVin outline here.
p99
aVHaiti is also dark,
p100
aVcompared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic,
p101
aVwhich has about the same number of residents.
p102
aVBoth of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,
p103
aVwhich has half as many residents
p104
aVas either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.
p105
aVWhat Haiti warns us is that
p106
aVrules can be bad because governments are weak.
p107
aVIt's not just that the rules are bad because
p108
aVthe government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.
p109
aVSo that if we want to create environments with good rules,
p110
aVwe can't just tear down.
p111
aVWe've got to find ways to build up, as well.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, China dramatically demonstrates
p114
aVboth the potential and the challenges
p115
aVof working with rules.
p116
aVBack in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,
p117
aVChina was the world's high-technology leader.
p118
aVChinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.
p119
aVBut the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,
p120
aVeffective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas \u2014
p121
aVa profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.
p122
aVAnd they soon adopted rules which
p123
aVslowed down innovation
p124
aVand cut China off from the rest of the world.
p125
aVSo as other countries in the world innovated,
p126
aVin the sense both of developing
p127
aVnewer technologies,
p128
aVbut also developing newer rules,
p129
aVthe Chinese were cut off from those advances.
p130
aVIncome there stayed stagnant,
p131
aVas it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.
p132
aa(lp133
VThis next chart looks at more recent data.
p134
aVIt plots income, average income in China
p135
aVas a percentage of average income in the United States.
p136
aVIn the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.
p137
aVBut then in the late '70s something changed.
p138
aVGrowth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up
p139
aVvery quickly with the United States.
p140
aa(lp141
VIf you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue
p142
aVto the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.
p143
aVThe brightest spot in China,
p144
aVwhich you can see on the edge of the outline here,
p145
aVis Hong Kong.
p146
aVHong Kong was a small bit of China
p147
aVthat, for most of the 20th century,
p148
aVoperated under a very different set of rules
p149
aVthan the rest of mainland China \u2014
p150
aVrules that were copied
p151
aVfrom working market economies of the time,
p152
aVand administered by the British.
p153
aa(lp154
VIn the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where
p155
aVmillions of people could go, from the mainland,
p156
aVto start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.
p157
aVBut, to get on a process of increasing income,
p158
aVincreasing skills
p159
aVled to very rapid growth there.
p160
aVHong Kong was also the model
p161
aVwhich leaders like Deng Xiaoping
p162
aVcould copy, when they decided to move
p163
aVall of the mainland towards the market model.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood
p166
aVthe importance of offering choices to his people.
p167
aVSo instead of forcing everyone in China
p168
aVto shift immediately to the market model,
p169
aVthey proceeded by creating some special zones
p170
aVthat could do, in a sense, what Britain did:
p171
aVmake the opportunity to go work with the market rules
p172
aVavailable to the people who wanted to opt in there.
p173
aVSo they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:
p174
aVzones where Chinese could come and work,
p175
aVand cities grew up very rapidly there;
p176
aValso zones where foreign firms could come in
p177
aVand make things.
p178
aa(lp179
VOne of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.
p180
aVIn that city there is a Taiwanese firm
p181
aVthat made the iPhone that many of you have,
p182
aVand they made it with labor from Chinese
p183
aVwho moved there to Shenzhen.
p184
aVSo after the four special zones,
p185
aVthere were 14 coastal cites
p186
aVthat were open in the same sense,
p187
aVand eventually demonstrated successes
p188
aVin these places that people could opt in to,
p189
aVthat they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.
p190
aVDemonstrated successes there led to a consensus for
p191
aVa move toward the market model for the entire economy.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow the Chinese example shows us several points.
p194
aVOne is: preserve choices for people.
p195
aVTwo: operate on the right scale.
p196
aVIf you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,
p197
aVbut a village would be too small
p198
aVto get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people
p199
aVall working under good rules.
p200
aVOn the other hand, the nation is too big.
p201
aVIf you try to change the rules in the nation,
p202
aVyou can't give some people a chance
p203
aVto hold back, see how things turn out,
p204
aVand let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.
p205
aVBut cities give you this opportunity
p206
aVto create new places,
p207
aVwith new rules that people can opt in to.
p208
aVAnd they're large enough
p209
aVto get all of the benefits that we can have
p210
aVwhen millions of us work together under good rules.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo the proposal is that we
p213
aVconceive of something called a charter city.
p214
aVWe start with a charter that specifies
p215
aVall the rules required
p216
aVto attract the people who we'll need to build the city.
p217
aVWe'll need to attract the investors
p218
aVwho will build out the infrastructure \u2014
p219
aVthe power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.
p220
aVYou'll need to attract firms,
p221
aVwho will come hire the people who move there first.
p222
aVAnd you'll need to attract families,
p223
aVthe residents who will come and live there permanently,
p224
aVraise their children, get an education for their children,
p225
aVand get their first job.
p226
aa(lp227
VWith that charter, people will move there.
p228
aVThe city can be built.
p229
aVAnd we can scale this model.
p230
aVWe can go do it over and over again.
p231
aVTo make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.
p232
aVThose are captured in the charter.
p233
aVWe also need the choices for people.
p234
aVThat's really built into the model
p235
aVif we allow for the possibility of building cities
p236
aVon uninhabited land.
p237
aVYou start from uninhabited territory.
p238
aVPeople can come live under the new charter,
p239
aVbut no one is forced to live under it.
p240
aVThe final thing we need are choices for leaders.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders
p243
aVwe need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:
p244
aVcases where nations work together,
p245
aVin effect, de facto,
p246
aVthe way China and Britain worked together
p247
aVto build, first a little enclave of the market model,
p248
aVand then scale it throughout China.
p249
aVIn a sense, Britain, inadvertently,
p250
aVthrough its actions in Hong Kong,
p251
aVdid more to reduce world poverty
p252
aVthan all the aid programs that we've undertaken
p253
aVin the last century.
p254
aVSo if we allow for these kind of partnerships
p255
aVto replicate this again,
p256
aVwe can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.
p257
aa(lp258
VIn some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility,
p259
aVa delegation of control from one country to another
p260
aVto take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.
p261
aVNow, when I say that,
p262
aVsome of you are starting to think,
p263
aV"Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?"
p264
aVIt's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions
p265
aVthat come up when we start to think about these things,
p266
aVcan get in the way, can make us pull back,
p267
aVcan shut down our ability,
p268
aVand our interest in trying to explore new ideas.
p269
aa(lp270
VWhy is this not like colonialism?
p271
aVThe thing that was bad about colonialism,
p272
aVand the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,
p273
aVis that it involved elements of
p274
aVcoercion and condescension.
p275
aVThis model is all about choices,
p276
aVboth for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.
p277
aVAnd, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo let's talk about how this could play out in practice.
p280
aVLet's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.
p281
aVIt must have occurred to Castro
p282
aVthat he has the chance to do for Cuba
p283
aVwhat Deng Xiaoping did for China,
p284
aVbut he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.
p285
aVHe does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south
p286
aVthat has a very special status.
p287
aVThere is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay,
p288
aVwhere a treaty gives the United States
p289
aVadministrative responsibility
p290
aVfor a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.
p291
aa(lp292
VCastro goes to the prime minister of Canada
p293
aVand says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.
p294
aVThey want to get out.
p295
aVWhy don't you, Canada, take over?
p296
aVBuild \u2014 run a special administrative zone.
p297
aVAllow a new city to be built up there.
p298
aVAllow many people to come in.
p299
aVLet us have a Hong Kong nearby.
p300
aVSome of my citizens will move into that city as well.
p301
aVOthers will hold back. But this will be
p302
aVthe gateway that will connect
p303
aVthe modern economy and the modern world
p304
aVto my country."
p305
aa(lp306
VNow, where else might this model be tried?
p307
aVWell, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.
p308
aVMany of them totally get the notion of a special zone
p309
aVthat people can opt into as a rule.
p310
aVIt's a rule for changing rules.
p311
aVIt's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in
p312
aVwithout coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.
p313
aVThey also totally get the idea that in some instances
p314
aVthey can make more credible promises to long-term investors \u2014
p315
aVthe kind of investors who will come build the port,
p316
aVbuild the roads, in a new city \u2014
p317
aa(lp318
Vthey can make more credible promises
p319
aVif they do it along with a partner nation.
p320
aVPerhaps even in some arrangement
p321
aVthat's a little bit like an escrow account,
p322
aVwhere you put land in the escrow account
p323
aVand the partner nation takes responsibility for it.
p324
aVThere is also lots of land in Africa
p325
aVwhere new cities could be built.
p326
aVThis is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.
p327
aVThere are immense stretches of land like this \u2014
p328
aVland where hundreds of millions of people could live.
p329
aVNow, if we generalize this and think about
p330
aVnot just one or two charter cites, but dozens \u2014
p331
aVcities that will help create places for the
p332
aVmany hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people
p333
aVwho will move to cities in the coming century \u2014
p334
aa(lp335
Vis there enough land for them?
p336
aVWell, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,
p337
aVthe one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks
p338
aVlike most of the world is already built out.
p339
aVSo let me show you why that's wrong.
p340
aVTake this representation of all of the land.
p341
aVTurn it into a square that stands for
p342
aVall the arable land on Earth.
p343
aVAnd let these dots represent the land that's already taken up
p344
aVby the cities that three billion people now live in.
p345
aVIf you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle
p346
aVyou can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents
p347
aVtake up only three percent of the arable land on earth.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo if we wanted to build cities for another billion people,
p350
aVthey would be dots like this.
p351
aVWe'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.
p352
aVWe'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth
p353
aVby building more cities that people can move to.
p354
aVAnd if these are cities governed by good rules,
p355
aVthey can be cities where people are safe from crime,
p356
aVsafe from disease and bad sanitation,
p357
aVwhere people have a chance to get a job.
p358
aVThey can get basic utilities like electricity.
p359
aVTheir kids can get an education.
p360
aa(lp361
VSo what will it take to get started
p362
aVbuilding the first charter cities,
p363
aVscaling this so we build many more?
p364
aVIt would help to have a manual.
p365
aV(Laughter)
p366
aVWhat university professors could do
p367
aVis write some details that might go into this manual.
p368
aVYou wouldn't want to let us run the cities,
p369
aVgo out and design them.
p370
aVYou wouldn't let academics out in the wild. (Laughter)
p371
aa(lp372
VBut, you could set us to work thinking about questions like,
p373
aVsuppose it isn't just Canada
p374
aVthat does the deal with Raul Castro.
p375
aVPerhaps Brazil comes in as a participant,
p376
aVand Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be
p377
aVone of the partners in a four-way joint venture.
p378
aVHow would we write the treaty to do that?
p379
aVThere is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.
p380
aa(lp381
VHow would we finance this?
p382
aVTurns out Singapore and Hong Kong
p383
aVare cities that made huge gains
p384
aVon the value of the land that they owned when they got started.
p385
aVYou could use the gains on the value of the land
p386
aVto pay for things like the police, the courts,
p387
aVbut the school system and the health care system too,
p388
aVwhich make this a more attractive place to live,
p389
aVmakes this a place where people have higher incomes \u2014
p390
aVwhich, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.
p391
aVSo the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone
p392
aVand build it, and set up the basic rules,
p393
aVgo very much in the right direction.
p394
aa(lp395
VSo there are many other details like this.
p396
aVHow could we have buildings that are
p397
aVlow cost and affordable for people who work
p398
aVin a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,
p399
aVbut make those buildings energy efficient,
p400
aVand make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down
p401
aVin an earthquake or a hurricane.
p402
aVMany technical details to be worked out,
p403
aVbut those of us who are already starting to pursue these things
p404
aVcan already tell that there is no roadblock,
p405
aVthere's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,
p406
aVthat will keep us from delivering on
p407
aVa truly global win-win solution.
p408
aa(lp409
VLet me conclude with this picture.
p410
aVThe reason we can be so well off,
p411
aVeven though there is so many people on earth,
p412
aVis because of the power of ideas.
p413
aVWe can share ideas with other people,
p414
aVand when they discover them, they share with us.
p415
aVIt's not like scarce objects,
p416
aVwhere sharing means we each get less.
p417
aVWhen we share ideas we all get more.
p418
aVWhen we think about ideas in that way,
p419
aVwe usually think about technologies.
p420
aa(lp421
VBut there is another class of ideas:
p422
aVthe rules that govern how we interact with each other;
p423
aVrules like, let's have a tax system
p424
aVthat supports a research university
p425
aVthat gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.
p426
aVLet's have a system where we have ownership of land
p427
aVthat is registered in a government office,
p428
aVthat people can pledge as collateral.
p429
aa(lp430
VIf we can keep innovating on our space of rules,
p431
aVand particularly innovate in the sense
p432
aVof coming up with rules for changing rules,
p433
aVso we don't get stuck with bad rules,
p434
aVthen we can keep moving progress forward
p435
aVand truly make the world a better place,
p436
aVso that people like Nelson and his friends
p437
aVdon't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.

VI'm a storyteller.
p5
aVAnd I would like to tell you a few personal stories
p6
aVabout what I like to call "the danger of the single story."
p7
aVI grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria.
p8
aVMy mother says that I started reading at the age of two,
p9
aValthough I think four is probably close to the truth.
p10
aVSo I was an early reader,
p11
aVand what I read were British and American children's books.
p12
aa(lp13
VI was also an early writer,
p14
aVand when I began to write, at about the age of seven,
p15
aVstories in pencil with crayon illustrations
p16
aVthat my poor mother was obligated to read,
p17
aVI wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading:
p18
aVAll my characters were white and blue-eyed,
p19
aVthey played in the snow,
p20
aVthey ate apples,
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
Vand they talked a lot about the weather,
p25
aVhow lovely it was that the sun had come out.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria.
p30
aVI had never been outside Nigeria.
p31
aVWe didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,
p32
aVand we never talked about the weather,
p33
aVbecause there was no need to.
p34
aa(lp35
VMy characters also drank a lot of ginger beer,
p36
aVbecause the characters in the British books I read
p37
aVdrank ginger beer.
p38
aVNever mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd for many years afterwards,
p43
aVI would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer.
p44
aVBut that is another story.
p45
aa(lp46
VWhat this demonstrates, I think,
p47
aVis how impressionable and vulnerable we are
p48
aVin the face of a story,
p49
aVparticularly as children.
p50
aVBecause all I had read were books in which characters were foreign,
p51
aVI had become convinced that books
p52
aVby their very nature had to have foreigners in them
p53
aVand had to be about things with which I could not personally identify.
p54
aVNow, things changed when I discovered African books.
p55
aVThere weren't many of them available,
p56
aVand they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye,
p59
aVI went through a mental shift in my perception of literature.
p60
aVI realized that people like me,
p61
aVgirls with skin the color of chocolate,
p62
aVwhose kinky hair could not form ponytails,
p63
aVcould also exist in literature.
p64
aVI started to write about things I recognized.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, I loved those American and British books I read.
p67
aVThey stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me.
p68
aVBut the unintended consequence
p69
aVwas that I did not know that people like me
p70
aVcould exist in literature.
p71
aVSo what the discovery of African writers did for me was this:
p72
aVIt saved me from having a single story of what books are.
p73
aa(lp74
VI come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family.
p75
aVMy father was a professor.
p76
aVMy mother was an administrator.
p77
aVAnd so we had, as was the norm,
p78
aVlive-in domestic help, who would often come from nearby rural villages.
p79
aVSo, the year I turned eight, we got a new house boy.
p80
aVHis name was Fide.
p81
aVThe only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor.
p82
aVMy mother sent yams and rice, and our old clothes, to his family.
p83
aVAnd when I didn't finish my dinner, my mother would say,
p84
aV"Finish your food! Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing."
p85
aVSo I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.
p86
aa(lp87
VThen one Saturday, we went to his village to visit,
p88
aVand his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket
p89
aVmade of dyed raffia that his brother had made.
p90
aVI was startled.
p91
aVIt had not occurred to me that anybody in his family
p92
aVcould actually make something.
p93
aVAll I had heard about them was how poor they were,
p94
aVso that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor.
p95
aVTheir poverty was my single story of them.
p96
aa(lp97
VYears later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria
p98
aVto go to university in the United States.
p99
aVI was 19.
p100
aVMy American roommate was shocked by me.
p101
aVShe asked where I had learned to speak English so well,
p102
aVand was confused when I said that Nigeria
p103
aVhappened to have English as its official language.
p104
aVShe asked if she could listen to what she called my "tribal music,"
p105
aVand was consequently very disappointed
p106
aVwhen I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VShe assumed that I did not know how to use a stove.
p111
aa(lp112
VWhat struck me was this:
p113
aVShe had felt sorry for me even before she saw me.
p114
aVHer default position toward me, as an African,
p115
aVwas a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity.
p116
aVMy roommate had a single story of Africa:
p117
aVa single story of catastrophe.
p118
aVIn this single story,
p119
aVthere was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way,
p120
aVno possibility of feelings more complex than pity,
p121
aVno possibility of a connection as human equals.
p122
aa(lp123
VI must say that before I went to the U.S.,
p124
aVI didn't consciously identify as African.
p125
aVBut in the U.S., whenever Africa came up, people turned to me.
p126
aVNever mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia.
p127
aVBut I did come to embrace this new identity,
p128
aVand in many ways I think of myself now as African.
p129
aVAlthough I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country,
p130
aVthe most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight
p131
aVfrom Lagos two days ago,
p132
aVin which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight
p133
aVabout the charity work in "India, Africa and other countries."
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VSo, after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African,
p138
aVI began to understand my roommate's response to me.
p139
aVIf I had not grown up in Nigeria,
p140
aVand if all I knew about Africa were from popular images,
p141
aVI too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes,
p142
aVbeautiful animals,
p143
aVand incomprehensible people,
p144
aVfighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS,
p145
aVunable to speak for themselves
p146
aVand waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner.
p147
aVI would see Africans in the same way that I,
p148
aVas a child, had seen Fide's family.
p149
aa(lp150
VThis single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature.
p151
aVNow, here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Lok,
p152
aVwho sailed to west Africa in 1561
p153
aVand kept a fascinating account of his voyage.
p154
aVAfter referring to the black Africans as "beasts who have no houses,"
p155
aVhe writes, "They are also people without heads,
p156
aVhaving their mouth and eyes in their breasts."
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, I've laughed every time I've read this.
p159
aVAnd one must admire the imagination of John Lok.
p160
aVBut what is important about his writing
p161
aVis that it represents the beginning
p162
aVof a tradition of telling African stories in the West:
p163
aVA tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives,
p164
aVof difference, of darkness,
p165
aVof people who, in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,
p166
aVare "half devil, half child."
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd so, I began to realize that my American roommate
p169
aVmust have throughout her life
p170
aVseen and heard different versions of this single story,
p171
aVas had a professor,
p172
aVwho once told me that my novel was not "authentically African."
p173
aVNow, I was quite willing to contend
p174
aVthat there were a number of things wrong with the novel,
p175
aVthat it had failed in a number of places,
p176
aVbut I had not quite imagined that it had failed
p177
aVat achieving something called African authenticity.
p178
aVIn fact, I did not know what African authenticity was.
p179
aVThe professor told me that my characters were too much like him,
p180
aVan educated and middle-class man.
p181
aVMy characters drove cars.
p182
aVThey were not starving.
p183
aVTherefore they were not authentically African.
p184
aa(lp185
VBut I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty
p186
aVin the question of the single story.
p187
aVA few years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S.
p188
aVThe political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense,
p189
aVand there were debates going on about immigration.
p190
aVAnd, as often happens in America,
p191
aVimmigration became synonymous with Mexicans.
p192
aVThere were endless stories of Mexicans
p193
aVas people who were fleecing the healthcare system,
p194
aVsneaking across the border,
p195
aVbeing arrested at the border, that sort of thing.
p196
aa(lp197
VI remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara,
p198
aVwatching the people going to work,
p199
aVrolling up tortillas in the marketplace,
p200
aVsmoking, laughing.
p201
aVI remember first feeling slight surprise.
p202
aVAnd then, I was overwhelmed with shame.
p203
aVI realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans
p204
aVthat they had become one thing in my mind,
p205
aVthe abject immigrant.
p206
aVI had bought into the single story of Mexicans
p207
aVand I could not have been more ashamed of myself.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo that is how to create a single story,
p210
aVshow a people as one thing,
p211
aVas only one thing,
p212
aVover and over again,
p213
aVand that is what they become.
p214
aa(lp215
VIt is impossible to talk about the single story
p216
aVwithout talking about power.
p217
aVThere is a word, an Igbo word,
p218
aVthat I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world,
p219
aVand it is "nkali."
p220
aVIt's a noun that loosely translates to "to be greater than another."
p221
aVLike our economic and political worlds,
p222
aVstories too are defined by the principle of nkali:
p223
aVHow they are told, who tells them,
p224
aVwhen they're told, how many stories are told,
p225
aVare really dependent on power.
p226
aa(lp227
VPower is the ability not just to tell the story of another person,
p228
aVbut to make it the definitive story of that person.
p229
aVThe Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes
p230
aVthat if you want to dispossess a people,
p231
aVthe simplest way to do it is to tell their story
p232
aVand to start with, "secondly."
p233
aVStart the story with the arrows of the Native Americans,
p234
aVand not with the arrival of the British,
p235
aVand you have an entirely different story.
p236
aVStart the story with the failure of the African state,
p237
aVand not with the colonial creation of the African state,
p238
aVand you have an entirely different story.
p239
aa(lp240
VI recently spoke at a university
p241
aVwhere a student told me that it was such a shame
p242
aVthat Nigerian men were physical abusers
p243
aVlike the father character in my novel.
p244
aVI told him that I had just read a novel called "American Psycho" \u2014
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
V\u2014 and that it was such a shame
p249
aVthat young Americans were serial murderers.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
V(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VNow, obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VBut it would never have occurred to me to think
p260
aVthat just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer
p261
aVthat he was somehow representative of all Americans.
p262
aVThis is not because I am a better person than that student,
p263
aVbut because of America's cultural and economic power,
p264
aVI had many stories of America.
p265
aVI had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.
p266
aVI did not have a single story of America.
p267
aa(lp268
VWhen I learned, some years ago,
p269
aVthat writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods
p270
aVto be successful,
p271
aVI began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VBut the truth is that I had a very happy childhood,
p276
aVfull of laughter and love, in a very close-knit family.
p277
aa(lp278
VBut I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps.
p279
aVMy cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare.
p280
aVOne of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a plane crash
p281
aVbecause our fire trucks did not have water.
p282
aVI grew up under repressive military governments
p283
aVthat devalued education,
p284
aVso that sometimes, my parents were not paid their salaries.
p285
aVAnd so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table,
p286
aVthen margarine disappeared,
p287
aVthen bread became too expensive,
p288
aVthen milk became rationed.
p289
aVAnd most of all, a kind of normalized political fear
p290
aVinvaded our lives.
p291
aa(lp292
VAll of these stories make me who I am.
p293
aVBut to insist on only these negative stories
p294
aVis to flatten my experience
p295
aVand to overlook the many other stories that formed me.
p296
aVThe single story creates stereotypes,
p297
aVand the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue,
p298
aVbut that they are incomplete.
p299
aVThey make one story become the only story.
p300
aa(lp301
VOf course, Africa is a continent full of catastrophes:
p302
aVThere are immense ones, such as the horrific rapes in Congo
p303
aVand depressing ones,
p304
aVsuch as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria.
p305
aVBut there are other stories that are not about catastrophe,
p306
aVand it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them.
p307
aa(lp308
VI've always felt that it is impossible
p309
aVto engage properly with a place or a person
p310
aVwithout engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person.
p311
aVThe consequence of the single story is this:
p312
aVIt robs people of dignity.
p313
aVIt makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult.
p314
aVIt emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo what if before my Mexican trip,
p317
aVI had followed the immigration debate from both sides,
p318
aVthe U.S. and the Mexican?
p319
aVWhat if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor
p320
aVand hardworking?
p321
aVWhat if we had an African television network
p322
aVthat broadcast diverse African stories all over the world?
p323
aVWhat the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls "a balance of stories."
p324
aa(lp325
VWhat if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher,
p326
aVMuhtar Bakare,
p327
aVa remarkable man who left his job in a bank
p328
aVto follow his dream and start a publishing house?
p329
aVNow, the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature.
p330
aVHe disagreed.
p331
aVHe felt that people who could read, would read,
p332
aVif you made literature affordable and available to them.
p333
aa(lp334
VShortly after he published my first novel,
p335
aVI went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview,
p336
aVand a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said,
p337
aV"I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending.
p338
aVNow, you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen ..."
p339
aa(lp340
V(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VAnd she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel.
p343
aVI was not only charmed, I was very moved.
p344
aVHere was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians,
p345
aVwho were not supposed to be readers.
p346
aVShe had not only read the book,
p347
aVbut she had taken ownership of it
p348
aVand felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.
p349
aa(lp350
VNow, what if my roommate knew about my friend Funmi Iyanda,
p351
aVa fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos,
p352
aVand is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget?
p353
aVWhat if my roommate knew about the heart procedure
p354
aVthat was performed in the Lagos hospital last week?
p355
aVWhat if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music,
p356
aVtalented people singing in English and Pidgin,
p357
aVand Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,
p358
aVmixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela
p359
aVto Bob Marley to their grandfathers.
p360
aa(lp361
VWhat if my roommate knew about the female lawyer
p362
aVwho recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law
p363
aVthat required women to get their husband's consent
p364
aVbefore renewing their passports?
p365
aVWhat if my roommate knew about Nollywood,
p366
aVfull of innovative people making films despite great technical odds,
p367
aVfilms so popular
p368
aVthat they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce?
p369
aVWhat if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider,
p370
aVwho has just started her own business selling hair extensions?
p371
aVOr about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail,
p372
aVbut continue to nurse ambition?
p373
aa(lp374
VEvery time I am home I am confronted
p375
aVwith the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians:
p376
aVour failed infrastructure, our failed government,
p377
aVbut also by the incredible resilience
p378
aVof people who thrive despite the government,
p379
aVrather than because of it.
p380
aVI teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer,
p381
aVand it is amazing to me how many people apply,
p382
aVhow many people are eager to write,
p383
aVto tell stories.
p384
aa(lp385
VMy Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit
p386
aVcalled Farafina Trust,
p387
aVand we have big dreams of building libraries
p388
aVand refurbishing libraries that already exist
p389
aVand providing books for state schools
p390
aVthat don't have anything in their libraries,
p391
aVand also of organizing lots and lots of workshops,
p392
aVin reading and writing,
p393
aVfor all the people who are eager to tell our many stories.
p394
aa(lp395
VStories matter.
p396
aVMany stories matter.
p397
aVStories have been used to dispossess and to malign,
p398
aVbut stories can also be used to empower and to humanize.
p399
aVStories can break the dignity of a people,
p400
aVbut stories can also repair that broken dignity.
p401
aa(lp402
VThe American writer Alice Walker wrote this
p403
aVabout her Southern relatives who had moved to the North.
p404
aVShe introduced them to a book about
p405
aVthe Southern life that they had left behind.
p406
aV"They sat around, reading the book themselves,
p407
aVlistening to me read the book, and a kind of paradise was regained."
p408
aa(lp409
VI would like to end with this thought:
p410
aVThat when we reject the single story,
p411
aVwhen we realize that there is never a single story
p412
aVabout any place,
p413
aVwe regain a kind of paradise.
p414
aa(lp415
VThank you.

VThis is a river.
p5
aVThis is a stream.
p6
aVThis is a river.
p7
aVThis is happening all over the country.
p8
aVThere are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States.
p9
aVOn this map, the colored areas represent water conflicts.
p10
aVSimilar problems are emerging in the East as well.
p11
aVThe reasons vary state to state, but mostly in the details.
p12
aVThere are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone.
p13
aVThey would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife.
p14
aVThey're the veins of the ecosystem,
p15
aVand they're often empty veins.
p16
aa(lp17
VI want to tell you the story of just one of these streams,
p18
aVbecause it's an archetype for the larger story.
p19
aVThis is Prickly Pear Creek.
p20
aVIt runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena.
p21
aVIt supports wild fish including cutthroat, brown and rainbow trout.
p22
aVNearly every year for more than a hundred years ...
p23
aVit looked like this in the summer.
p24
aVHow did we get here?
p25
aVWell, it started back in the late 1800s
p26
aVwhen people started settling in places like Montana.
p27
aVIn short, there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people.
p28
aVBut as more people showed up wanting water,
p29
aVthe folks who were there first got a little concerned,
p30
aVand in 1865, Montana passed its first water law.
p31
aVIt basically said, everybody near the stream can share in the stream.
p32
aVOddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream,
p33
aVand the folks who were there first
p34
aVgot concerned enough to bring out their lawyers.
p35
aVThere were precedent-setting suits in 1870 and 1872,
p36
aVboth involving Prickly Pear Creek.
p37
aVAnd in 1921,
p38
aVthe Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear
p39
aVthat the folks who were there first had the first, or "senior water rights."
p40
aVThese senior water rights are key.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe problem is that all over the West now it looks like this.
p43
aVSome of these creeks have claims
p44
aVfor 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream.
p45
aVAnd the senior water rights holders, if they don't use their water right,
p46
aVthey risk losing their water right \u2014
p47
aValong with the economic value that goes with it.
p48
aVSo they have no incentive to conserve.
p49
aVSo it's not just about the number of people;
p50
aVthe system itself creates a disincentive to conserve
p51
aVbecause you can lose your water right if you don't use it.
p52
aVSo after decades of lawsuits and 140 years, now, of experience,
p53
aVwe still have this.
p54
aVIt's a broken system.
p55
aVThere's a disincentive to conserve,
p56
aVbecause if you don't use your water right, you can lose your water right.
p57
aVAnd I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts
p58
aVbetween the agricultural and environmental communities.
p59
aa(lp60
VOK, now I'm going to change gears here.
p61
aVMost of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free ...
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
Vand some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VThere's another thing happening around the country,
p70
aVwhich is that companies are starting to get concerned
p71
aVabout their water footprint.
p72
aVThey're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water,
p73
aVthey're trying to be really efficient with their water use,
p74
aVand they're concerned about how their water use
p75
aVaffects the image of their brand.
p76
aVWell, it's a national problem,
p77
aVbut I'm going to tell you another story from Montana ...
p78
aVand it involves beer.
p79
aVI bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water
p80
aVto make a pint of beer.
p81
aVIf you include all the drain,
p82
aVit takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow the brewers in Montana
p85
aVhave already done a lot to reduce their water consumption,
p86
aVbut they still use millions of gallons of water.
p87
aVI mean, there's water in beer.
p88
aVSo what can they do about this remaining water footprint
p89
aVthat can have serious effects on the ecosystem?
p90
aVThese ecosystems are really important
p91
aVto the Montana brewers and their customers.
p92
aVAfter all, there's a strong correlation between water and fishing,
p93
aVand for some, there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VSo the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned
p98
aVand they're looking for some way to address the problem.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo how can they address this remaining water footprint?
p101
aVRemember Prickly Pear.
p102
aVUp until now, business water stewardship
p103
aVhas been limited to measuring and reducing,
p104
aVand we're suggesting that the next step is to restore.
p105
aVRemember Prickly Pear.
p106
aVIt's a broken system.
p107
aVYou've got a disincentive to conserve,
p108
aVbecause if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right.
p109
aVWell, we decided to connect these two worlds \u2014
p110
aVthe world of the companies with their water footprints
p111
aVand the world of the farmers
p112
aVwith their senior water rights on these creeks.
p113
aVIn some states,
p114
aVsenior water rights holders can leave their water in the stream
p115
aVwhile legally protecting it from others,
p116
aVand maintaining their water right.
p117
aVAfter all, it is their water right,
p118
aVand if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream,
p119
aVit's their right to do so.
p120
aVBut they have no incentive to do so.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo, working with local water trusts, we created an incentive to do so.
p123
aVWe pay them to leave their water in stream.
p124
aVThat's what's happening here.
p125
aVThis individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion,
p126
aVleaving the water in the stream.
p127
aVHe doesn't lose the water right,
p128
aVhe just chooses to apply that right, or some portion of it,
p129
aVto the stream, instead of to the land.
p130
aVBecause he's the senior water-rights holder,
p131
aVhe can protect the water from other users in the stream.
p132
aVOK?
p133
aVHe gets paid to leave the water in the stream.
p134
aa(lp135
VThis guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream.
p136
aVWe then take the measured water,
p137
aVwe divide it into thousand-gallon increments.
p138
aVEach increment gets a serial number and a certificate,
p139
aVand then the brewers and others buy those certificates
p140
aVas a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems.
p141
aVThe brewers pay to restore water to the stream.
p142
aVIt provides a simple, inexpensive and measurable way
p143
aVto return water to these degraded ecosystems,
p144
aVwhile giving farmers an economic choice
p145
aVand giving businesses concerned about their water footprints
p146
aVan easy way to deal with them.
p147
aa(lp148
VAfter 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams,
p149
aVa circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved,
p150
aVwe put together a market-based, willing buyer, willing seller solution \u2014
p151
aVa solution that does not require litigation.
p152
aVIt's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints
p153
aVa real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed,
p154
aVinto these degraded ecosystems,
p155
aVwhile at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice
p156
aVabout how their water is used.
p157
aa(lp158
VThese transactions create allies, not enemies.
p159
aVThey connect people rather than dividing them.
p160
aVAnd they provide needed economic support for rural communities.
p161
aVAnd most importantly, it's working.
p162
aVWe've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems.
p163
aVWe've connected senior water-rights holders
p164
aVwith brewers in Montana,
p165
aVwith hotels and tea companies in Oregon,
p166
aVand with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest.
p167
aVAnd when we make these connections,
p168
aVwe can and we do turn this ...
p169
aVinto this.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Applause)
p172
aa(lp173
VThank you very much.

environmental footprint is something that  Rob Harmon has been doing for years. Starting as an energy auditor in  Massachusetts, Harmon went on to manage an international marketing  effort in the wind energy industry and, in 2000, develop and launch the  first carbon calculator on the Internet. <br /><br />Harmon joined  <a href=\\"http://www.b-e-f.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Bonneville Environmental Foundation</a>  (BEF) in 1999, and is credited with  developing their Green Tag program. In 2004, he was awarded the  national Green Power Pioneer Award for his introduction of the retail  Green Tag (Renewable Energy Certificates) and his ongoing efforts to  build a thriving and credible Green Tag market in the United States. He  also conceptualized and directed the development of BEF&#39;s national  Solar 4R Schools program. His latest venture is the creation of  BEF&#39;s Water Restoration Certificate business line, which utilizes  voluntary markets to restore critically de-watered ecosystems. He recently contributed chapters to the  book <em>Voluntary Carbon Markets: A Business Guide to What They Are and How They Work</em>.

VI would be willing to bet I'm the dumbest guy in the room,
p5
aVbecause I couldn't get through school; I struggled with school.
p6
aVBut I knew at a very early age that I loved money, I loved business
p7
aVand I loved this entrepreneurial thing.
p8
aVI was raised to be an entrepreneur.
p9
aVWhat I've been really passionate about ever since \u2014
p10
aVand I've never spoken about this ever, until now \u2014
p11
aVso this is the first time anyone's heard it,
p12
aVexcept my wife, three days ago.
p13
aVShe said, "What are you talking about?"
p14
aVI told her that I think we miss an opportunity
p15
aVto find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits,
p16
aVand to groom them or show them
p17
aVthat being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing.
p18
aVIt's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified,
p19
aVwhich is what happens in a lot of society.
p20
aa(lp21
VKids, when we grow up, have dreams,
p22
aVand we have passions, and we have visions,
p23
aVand somehow we get those things crushed.
p24
aVWe get told that we need to study harder
p25
aVor be more focused or get a tutor.
p26
aVMy parents got me a tutor in French, and I still suck in French.
p27
aVTwo years ago,
p28
aVI was the highest-rated lecturer at MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.
p29
aVIt was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs
p30
aVfrom around the world.
p31
aVWhen I was in grade two, I won a citywide speaking competition,
p32
aVbut nobody had ever said, "Hey, this kid's a good speaker.
p33
aVHe can't focus, but he loves walking around and getting people energized."
p34
aVNo one said, "Get him a coach in speaking."
p35
aVThey said, get me a tutor in what I suck at.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo as kids show these traits \u2014 and we need to start looking for them \u2014
p38
aVI think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.
p39
aVUnfortunately, the school system is grooming this world to say,
p40
aV"Let's be a lawyer," or, "Let's be a doctor."
p41
aVWe're missing that opportunity,
p42
aVbecause no one ever says, "Hey, be an entrepreneur."
p43
aVEntrepreneurs are people \u2014 we have a lot of them in this room \u2014
p44
aVwho have ideas and passions or see these needs in the world
p45
aVand decide to stand up and do it.
p46
aVAnd we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen.
p47
aVWe have the ability to get the groups of people around us
p48
aVthat want to build that dream with us.
p49
aVAnd I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age,
p50
aVof being entrepreneurial,
p51
aVwe could change everything in the world that's a problem today.
p52
aVEvery problem out there, somebody has the idea for.
p53
aVAnd as a young kid, nobody can say it can't happen,
p54
aVbecause you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out.
p55
aa(lp56
VI think we have an obligation as parents and a society
p57
aVto start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish \u2014
p58
aVthe old parable: "Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.
p59
aVTeach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime."
p60
aVIf we can teach our kids to be entrepreneurial,
p61
aVthe ones that show the traits to be,
p62
aVlike we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science,
p63
aVwhat if we saw the ones with entrepreneurial traits
p64
aVand taught them to be entrepreneurs?
p65
aVWe could have these kids spreading businesses
p66
aVinstead of waiting for government handouts.
p67
aa(lp68
VWhat we do is teach our kids the things they shouldn't do:
p69
aVdon't hit; don't bite; don't swear.
p70
aVRight now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs;
p71
aVthe school system teaches them to go after things like
p72
aVbeing a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist
p73
aVand a teacher and a pilot.
p74
aVAnd the media says it's really cool if we could go out
p75
aVand be a model or a singer
p76
aVor a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.
p77
aVOur MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs.
p78
aVThe reason I avoided an MBA program, other than that I didn't get into any,
p79
aVsince I had a 61 percent average out of high school,
p80
aVthen a 61 percent average
p81
aVat the only school in Canada that accepted me, Carlton,
p82
aVis that our MBA programs don't teach kids to be entrepreneurs.
p83
aVThey teach them to work in corporations.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo who's starting these companies? It's these random few people.
p86
aVEven in popular literature, the only book I've ever found \u2014
p87
aVand this should be on all your reading lists \u2014
p88
aVthe only book I've ever found
p89
aVthat makes the entrepreneur a hero is "Atlas Shrugged."
p90
aVEverything else in the world looks at entrepreneurs
p91
aVand says we're bad people.
p92
aVI look at even my family.
p93
aVBoth my grandfathers and my dad were entrepreneurs.
p94
aVMy brother, sister and I, all three of us own companies as well.
p95
aVWe all decided to start these things because it's the only place we fit.
p96
aVWe didn't fit in normal work; we couldn't work for somebody else,
p97
aVwe're stubborn and we have all these other traits.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut kids could be entrepreneurs as well.
p100
aVI'm a big part of a couple organizations
p101
aVcalled the Entrepreneurs' Organization and the Young Presidents' Organization.
p102
aVI just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference.
p103
aVAnd everyone I met over there who's an entrepreneur
p104
aVstruggled with school.
p105
aVI have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.
p106
aVSo this thing right here is freaking me out.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VIt's probably why I'm a bit panicked,
p111
aVother than all the caffeine I've had and the sugar.
p112
aVBut this is really creepy for an entrepreneur.
p113
aVAttention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder.
p114
aVDo you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease?
p115
aVTed Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.
p116
aVAll three of the founders of Netscape had it.
p117
aVI could go on and on.
p118
aVKids \u2014 you can see these signs in kids.
p119
aVAnd we're giving them Ritalin and saying,
p120
aV"Don't be an entrepreneurial type.
p121
aVFit into this other system and try to become a student."
p122
aVSorry, entrepreneurs aren't students.
p123
aVWe fast-track. We figure out the game.
p124
aVI stole essays. I cheated on exams.
p125
aVI hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university
p126
aVfor 13 consecutive assignments.
p127
aVBut as an entrepreneur, you don't do accounting, you hire accountants.
p128
aVSo I just figured that out earlier.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
V(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
VAt least I can admit I cheated in university; most of you won't.
p135
aVI'm also quoted \u2014 and I told the person who wrote the textbook \u2014
p136
aVI'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook
p137
aVin every Canadian university and college studies \u2014
p138
aVin managerial accounting, I'm chapter eight.
p139
aVI open up chapter eight, talking about budgeting.
p140
aVI told the author, after they did my interview,
p141
aVthat I cheated in that same course.
p142
aVShe thought it was too funny to not include it.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut kids, you can see these signs in them.
p145
aVThe definition of entrepreneur is "a person who organizes, operates
p146
aVand assumes the risk of a business venture."
p147
aVThat doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program,
p148
aVor that you have to get through school.
p149
aVIt just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut.
p150
aVWe've heard, "Is it nurture or is it nature?" Right?
p151
aVIs it thing one or thing two? What is it?
p152
aVWell, I don't think it's either. I think it can be both.
p153
aVI was groomed as an entrepreneur.
p154
aa(lp155
VWhen I was growing up as a young kid, I had no choice,
p156
aVbecause I was taught at a very early age,
p157
aVwhen my dad realized I didn't fit into everything else
p158
aVthat was being taught to me in school,
p159
aVthat he could teach me to figure out business at an early age.
p160
aVHe groomed us, the three of us, to hate the thought of having a job
p161
aVand to love the fact of creating companies
p162
aVwhere we could employ other people.
p163
aa(lp164
VMy first business venture: I was seven years old, in Winnipeg.
p165
aVI was in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords,
p166
aVcalling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg
p167
aVto find out how much they'd pay me for coat hangers.
p168
aVAnd my mom came into the room and said,
p169
aV"Where are you going to get the hangers to sell to the dry cleaners?"
p170
aVAnd I said, "Let's go look in the basement."
p171
aVWe went down to the basement, and I opened up this cupboard.
p172
aVThere was about 1,000 hangers that I'd collected,
p173
aVbecause, when I told her I was going out to play,
p174
aVI was going door to door in the neighborhood
p175
aVto collect hangers to put in the basement,
p176
aVbecause I saw her a few weeks before that \u2014
p177
aVyou could get paid, they used to pay two cents per coat hanger.
p178
aVSo I was like, well, there's all kinds of hangers,
p179
aVso I'll just go get them.
p180
aVI knew she wouldn't want me to get them,
p181
aVso I just did it anyway.
p182
aVAnd I learned that you could actually negotiate with people.
p183
aVThis one guy offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half.
p184
aVI even knew at seven years old
p185
aVthat I could get a fractional percent of a cent,
p186
aVand people would pay it, because it multiplied up.
p187
aVAt seven years old I figured it out.
p188
aVI got three and a half cents for 1,000 hangers.
p189
aa(lp190
VI sold license plate protectors door to door.
p191
aVMy dad actually made me go find someone
p192
aVwho would sell me them at wholesale.
p193
aVAt nine years old, I walked around in the city of Sudbury
p194
aVselling license-plate protectors door to door.
p195
aVAnd I remember this one customer so vividly \u2014
p196
aVI also did some other stuff with these clients, I sold newspapers,
p197
aVand he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me, ever.
p198
aVBut I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license-plate protector.
p199
aVAnd he's like, "We don't need one."
p200
aVI said, "But you've got two cars."
p201
aVRemember, I'm nine years old.
p202
aVI'm like, "You have two cars and they don't have license-plate protectors.
p203
aVAnd this car has one license plate that's all crumpled up."
p204
aVHe said, "That's my wife's car."
p205
aVI said, "Why don't we test one on her car and see if it lasts longer?"
p206
aVSo I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each.
p207
aVIf I couldn't sell all four, I could at least get one.
p208
aVI learned that at a young age.
p209
aa(lp210
VI did comic book arbitrage.
p211
aVWhen I was about 10 years old, I sold comic books
p212
aVout of our cottage on Georgian Bay.
p213
aVI would go biking up to the end of the beach,
p214
aVbuy all the comics from the poor kids,
p215
aVthen go back to the other end of the beach to sell them to the rich kids.
p216
aVIt was obvious to me: buy low, sell high.
p217
aVYou've got this demand over here that has money.
p218
aVDon't try to sell to the poor kids; they don't have cash.
p219
aVThe rich people do. Obvious, right?
p220
aVIt's like a recession.
p221
aVSo there's a recession.
p222
aVThere's still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the US economy.
p223
aVGo get some of that. I learned that at a young age.
p224
aVI also learned, don't reveal your source:
p225
aVI got beat up after four weeks of this,
p226
aVbecause one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics,
p227
aVand didn't like that he was paying more.
p228
aa(lp229
VI was forced to get a paper route at 10 years old.
p230
aVI didn't want a paper route, but my dad said, "That's your next business."
p231
aVNot only did he get me one, but I had to get two.
p232
aVHe wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers,
p233
aVwhich I did.
p234
aVThen I realized: collecting tips is how you made all the money.
p235
aVSo I'd collect tips and get payment.
p236
aVI would collect for the papers \u2014 he could just deliver them.
p237
aVBecause then I realized I could make money.
p238
aVBy this point, I was definitely not going to be an employee.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VMy dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop.
p243
aVHe had all these old automotive parts lying around.
p244
aVThey had this old brass and copper.
p245
aVI asked what he did with it, and he said he just throws it out.
p246
aVI said, "Wouldn't somebody pay for that?" And he goes, "Maybe."
p247
aVRemember: at 10 years old, 34 years ago,
p248
aVI saw opportunity in this stuff, I saw there was money in garbage.
p249
aVAnd I collected it from the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle.
p250
aVThen my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler
p251
aVwhere I got paid.
p252
aVAnd I thought that was kind of cool.
p253
aVStrangely enough, 30 years later, we're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK?
p254
aVand making money off that, too.
p255
aa(lp256
VI built these little pincushions when I was 11 years old in Cubs.
p257
aVWe made these pincushions for our moms for Mother's Day
p258
aVout of wooden clothespins \u2014
p259
aVwhen we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside.
p260
aVAnd you'd make these chairs.
p261
aVAnd I had these little pillows that I would sew up.
p262
aVAnd you could stuff pins in them.
p263
aVBecause people used to sew and they needed a pincushion.
p264
aVBut I realized you had to have options,
p265
aVso I spray-painted a whole bunch of them brown,
p266
aVso when I went to the door, it wasn't, "Do you want to buy one?"
p267
aVIt was, "Which color would you like?"
p268
aVI'm 10 years old; you're not going to say no,
p269
aVespecially if you have two options, the brown one or the clear one.
p270
aVSo I learned that lesson at a young age.
p271
aa(lp272
VI learned that manual labor really sucks.
p273
aVRight, like cutting lawns is brutal.
p274
aVBut because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors
p275
aVand get paid to do that,
p276
aVI realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing,
p277
aVthat if I land this client once,
p278
aVand every week I get paid by that person,
p279
aVthat's way better than trying to sell one clothespin thing to one person,
p280
aVbecause you can't sell them more.
p281
aVSo I love that recurring revenue model I started to learn at a young age.
p282
aa(lp283
VRemember, I was being groomed to do this. I was not allowed to have jobs.
p284
aVI would go to the golf course and caddy for people,
p285
aVbut I realized there was this one hill on our golf course, the 13th hole,
p286
aVthat had this huge hill,
p287
aVand people could never get their bags up it.
p288
aVSo I'd sit there in a lawn chair and carry for all the people
p289
aVwho didn't have caddies.
p290
aVI'd carry their golf bags to the top; they'd pay me a dollar,
p291
aVwhile my friends worked for hours hauling some guy's bag around
p292
aVfor 10 bucks.
p293
aVI'm like, "That's stupid. You have to work for five hours.
p294
aVThat doesn't make sense. Figure out a way to make more money faster.
p295
aa(lp296
VEvery week, I'd go to the corner store and buy all these pops,
p297
aVThen I'd deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge.
p298
aVThey'd give me their orders for the following week.
p299
aVI'd deliver pop and charge twice.
p300
aVI had this captured market.
p301
aVYou didn't need contracts, you just needed to have a supply and demand
p302
aVand this audience who bought into you.
p303
aVThese women weren't going to go to anybody else
p304
aVbecause they liked me, and I kind of figured it out.
p305
aa(lp306
VI went and got golf balls from golf courses.
p307
aVBut everybody else was looking in the bush
p308
aVand looking in the ditches for golf balls.
p309
aVI'm like, screw that. They're in the pond. And nobody's going into the pond.
p310
aVSo I'd go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes,
p311
aVjust pick them up with both feet.
p312
aVYou can't do it onstage.
p313
aVYou get the golf balls, throw them in your bathing suit trunks
p314
aVand when you're done, you've got a couple hundred of them.
p315
aVBut the problem is, people didn't want all the golf balls.
p316
aVSo I just packaged them. I'm like 12, right?
p317
aVI packaged them up three ways.
p318
aVI had the Pinnacles, DDHs and the really cool ones.
p319
aVThose sold for two dollars each.
p320
aVThen I had the good ones that didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.
p321
aVAnd then I'd sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones.
p322
aVAnd they could use those for practice balls.
p323
aa(lp324
VI sold sunglasses when I was in school,
p325
aVto all the kids in high school.
p326
aVThis is what really kind of gets everybody hating you,
p327
aVbecause you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time.
p328
aVBut it paid the bills.
p329
aVSo I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.
p330
aVThen when the school shut me down \u2014
p331
aVthey called me into the office and told me I couldn't do it \u2014
p332
aVI went to the gas stations and sold lots of them to the gas stations
p333
aVand had the gas stations sell them to their customers.
p334
aVThat was cool because then, I had retail outlets.
p335
aVI think I was 14.
p336
aa(lp337
VThen I paid my entire way through first year of university at Carlton
p338
aVby selling wineskins door to door.
p339
aVYou know you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rum
p340
aVand two bottles of coke in a wineskin?
p341
aVSo what, right? But you know what?
p342
aVStuff that down your shorts when you go to a football game,
p343
aVyou can get booze in for free.
p344
aVEverybody bought them.
p345
aVSupply, demand, big opportunity.
p346
aVI also branded it, so I sold them for five times the normal cost.
p347
aVIt had our university logo on it.
p348
aa(lp349
VYou know, we teach our kids and we buy them games,
p350
aVbut why don't we get them games, if they're entrepreneurial kids,
p351
aVthat nurture the traits you need to be entrepreneurs?
p352
aVWhy don't you teach them not to waste money?
p353
aVI remember being told to walk out into the middle of a street
p354
aVin Banff, Alberta.
p355
aVI'd thrown a penny out in the street,
p356
aVand my dad said, "Go pick it up.
p357
aVI work too damn hard for my money. I'm not going to see you waste a penny."
p358
aVI remember that lesson to this day.
p359
aa(lp360
VAllowances teach kids the wrong habits.
p361
aVAllowances, by nature, are teaching kids to think about a job.
p362
aVAn entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck.
p363
aVAllowance is breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck.
p364
aVThat's wrong, for me, if you want to raise entrepreneurs.
p365
aVWhat I do with my kids, nine and seven,
p366
aVis teach them to walk around the house and the yard,
p367
aVlooking for stuff that needs to get done.
p368
aVCome and tell me what it is.
p369
aVOr I'll say, "Here's what I need done."
p370
aVAnd then, you know what we do? We negotiate.
p371
aVThey go around looking for what it is,
p372
aVthen we negotiate what they'll get paid.
p373
aVThey don't have a regular check,
p374
aVbut they have opportunities to find more stuff,
p375
aVand learn the skill of negotiating and of finding opportunities.
p376
aa(lp377
VYou breed that kind of stuff.
p378
aVEach of my kids has two piggy banks.
p379
aVFifty percent of all the money they earn goes in their house account,
p380
aV50 percent goes in their toy account.
p381
aVThe toy account, they spend on whatever they want.
p382
aVThe 50 percent in their house account, every six months, goes to the bank.
p383
aVthey walk up with me.
p384
aVEvery year, all the money in the bank goes to their broker.
p385
aVBoth my nine- and seven-year-olds have a stockbroker already.
p386
aVI'm teaching them to force that savings habit.
p387
aVIt drives me crazy that 30-year-olds are saying,
p388
aV"Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now."
p389
aVShit, you've missed 25 years.
p390
aVYou can teach those habits to young kids,
p391
aVwhen they don't even feel the pain yet.
p392
aa(lp393
VDon't read bedtime stories every night \u2014 maybe four nights of the week,
p394
aVand three nights, have them tell stories.
p395
aVWhy don't you sit down with kids and give them four items,
p396
aVa red shirt, a blue tie, a kangaroo and a laptop,
p397
aVand have them tell a story about those four things?
p398
aVMy kids do that all the time.
p399
aVIt teaches them to sell, teaches them creativity,
p400
aVteaches them to think on their feet.
p401
aVDo that kind of stuff, have fun with it.
p402
aa(lp403
VGet kids to stand up in front of groups and talk,
p404
aVeven if it's just in front of their friends,
p405
aVand do plays and have speeches.
p406
aVThose are entrepreneurial traits you want to be nurturing.
p407
aVShow kids what bad customers or bad employees look like.
p408
aVShow them grumpy employees.
p409
aVWhen you see grumpy customer service, point it out.
p410
aVSay, "By the way, that guy is a crappy employee."
p411
aVAnd say, "These are good ones."
p412
aa(lp413
V(Laughter)
p414
aa(lp415
VIf you go into a restaurant and have bad customer service,
p416
aVshow them what bad customer service looks like.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Laughter)
p419
aa(lp420
VWe have all these lessons in front of us,
p421
aVbut we don't take those opportunities; we teach kids to get a tutor.
p422
aVImagine if you actually took all the kids' junk in the house right now,
p423
aVall the toys they outgrew two years ago
p424
aVand said, "Why don't we sell some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?"
p425
aVAnd they actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when offers come in.
p426
aVThey can come into your account or a sub account or whatever.
p427
aVBut teach them how to fix the price, guess the price,
p428
aVpull up the photos.
p429
aVTeach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money.
p430
aVThen 50 percent goes in their house account,
p431
aV50 percent in their toy account.
p432
aVMy kids love this stuff.
p433
aa(lp434
VSome of the entrepreneurial traits you've got to nurture in kids:
p435
aVattainment, tenacity, leadership, introspection, interdependence, values.
p436
aVAll these traits, you can find in young kids, and you can help nurture them.
p437
aVLook for that kind of stuff.
p438
aVThere's two traits I want you to also look out for
p439
aVthat we don't get out of their system.
p440
aVDon't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder
p441
aVunless it is really, really freaking bad.
p442
aa(lp443
V(Applause)
p444
aa(lp445
VThe same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression,
p446
aVunless it is so clinically brutal, man.
p447
aVBipolar disorder is nicknamed "the CEO disease."
p448
aVWhen Steve Jurvetson, Jim Clark and Jim Barksdale have all got it,
p449
aVand they built Netscape \u2014
p450
aVimagine if they were given Ritalin.
p451
aVWe wouldn't have that stuff, right?
p452
aVAl Gore really would have had to invented the Internet.
p453
aa(lp454
V(Laughter)
p455
aa(lp456
VThese are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom,
p457
aVas well as everything else.
p458
aVI'm not saying don't get kids to want to be lawyers.
p459
aVBut how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there
p460
aVwith the rest of them?
p461
aVBecause there's huge opportunities in that.
p462
aa(lp463
VI want to close with a quick video
p464
aVthat was done by one of the companies I mentor.
p465
aVThese guys, Grasshopper.
p466
aVIt's about kids.
p467
aVIt's about entrepreneurship.
p468
aVHopefully, this inspires you to take what you've heard from me
p469
aVand do something with it to change the world.
p470
aa(lp471
V[Kid... "And you thought you could do anything?"]
p472
aa(lp473
V[You still can.]
p474
aa(lp475
V[Because a lot of what we consider impossible]
p476
aV[is easy to overcome]
p477
aa(lp478
V[Because in case you haven't noticed, we live in a place where]
p479
aV[one individual can make a difference]
p480
aa(lp481
V[Want proof?]
p482
aV[Just look at the people who built our country:]
p483
aV[Our parents, grandparents, our aunts, uncles]
p484
aV[They were immigrants, newcomers ready to make their mark]
p485
aV[Maybe they came with very little]
p486
aV[or perhaps they didn't own anything except for]
p487
aV[a single brilliant idea]
p488
aV[These people were thinkers, doers]
p489
aV[innovators]
p490
aV[until they came up with the name]
p491
aV[entrepreneurs]
p492
aa(lp493
V[They change the way we think about what is possible.]
p494
aV[They have a clear vision of how life can be better]
p495
aV[for all of us, even when times are tough.]
p496
aa(lp497
V[Right now, it's hard to see]
p498
aV[when our view is cluttered with obstacles.]
p499
aV[But turbulence creates opportunities]
p500
aV[for success, achievement, and pushes us]
p501
aV[to discover new ways of doing things]
p502
aa(lp503
V[So what opportunities will you go after and why?]
p504
aV[If you're an entrepreneur]
p505
aV[you know that risk isn't the reward.]
p506
aV[No. The rewards are driving innovation]
p507
aV[changing people's lives. Creating jobs.]
p508
aV[Fueling growth.]
p509
aV[And making a better world.]
p510
aa(lp511
V[Entrepreneurs are everywhere.]
p512
aV[They run small businesses that support our economy,]
p513
aV[design tools to help you]
p514
aV[stay connected with friends, family and colleagues]
p515
aV[And they're finding new ways of helping to solve society's oldest problems.]
p516
aa(lp517
V[Do you know an entrepreneur?]
p518
aV[Entrepreneurs can be anyone Even... you]
p519
aV[So seize the opportunity to create the job you always wanted]
p520
aV[Help heal the economy]
p521
aV[Make a difference.]
p522
aV[Take your business to new heights,]
p523
aV[but most importantly,]
p524
aV[remember when you were a kid]
p525
aV[when everything was within your reach,]
p526
aV[and then say to yourself quietly, but with determination:]
p527
aa(lp528
V[it still is.]
p529
aa(lp530
VThank you very much for having me.

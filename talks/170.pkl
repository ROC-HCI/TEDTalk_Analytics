VI've actually been waiting by the phone
p5
aVfor a call from TED for years.
p6
aVAnd in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.
p7
aVIn 2003, I was ready to do a talk
p8
aVabout the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.
p9
aVIn 2004, I started Participant Productions
p10
aVand we had a really good first year, and no call.
p11
aVAnd finally, I get a call last year,
p12
aVand then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVYou've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VWhen I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,
p18
aVI had some misgivings.
p19
aVBut I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVAnd, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.
p22
aVAnd I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley
p23
aVhave a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
p24
aVHollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVHollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.
p27
aVHollywood gathers around power tables,
p28
aVand the Valley gathers around power tables.
p29
aVSo it turned out there was a lot more in common
p30
aVthan I would have dreamed.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut I'm actually here today to tell a story.
p33
aVAnd part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,
p34
aVhe said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,
p35
aVand they want to know what drives you a bit.
p36
aVAnd what really drives me is a vision of the future
p37
aVthat I think we all share.
p38
aVIt's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.
p39
aVAnd when we heard a lot of the presentations
p40
aVover the last couple of days,
p41
aVEd Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,
p42
aVI think we all realized how far we have to go
p43
aVto get to this new version of humanity
p44
aVthat I like to call "Humanity 2.0."
p45
aVAnd it's also something that resides in each of us,
p46
aVto close what I think
p47
aVare the two big calamities in the world today.
p48
aa(lp49
VOne is the gap in opportunity \u2014
p50
aVthis gap that President Clinton last night
p51
aVcalled uneven, unfair and unsustainable \u2014
p52
aVand, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease
p53
aVand all these evils that we see around us.
p54
aVBut perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.
p55
aVAnd someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea
p56
aVthat an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.
p57
aVAnd I think that's just a horrible thing.
p58
aVAnd so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,
p59
aVbecause within each of us is the power to
p60
aVequal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.
p61
aVAnd if the men and women of TED
p62
aVcan't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd for me, a lot of this started when I was younger
p65
aVand my family used to go camping in upstate New York.
p66
aVAnd there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,
p67
aVexcept get beaten up by my sister or read books.
p68
aVAnd so I used to read authors like James Michener
p69
aVand James Clavell and Ayn Rand.
p70
aVAnd their stories made the world seem a very small
p71
aVand interconnected place.
p72
aVAnd it struck me that if I could write stories
p73
aVthat were about this world as being small and interconnected,
p74
aVthat maybe I could get people interested in the issues
p75
aVthat affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.
p76
aa(lp77
VI didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,
p78
aVso I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,
p79
aVso I could write these stories as quickly as I could.
p80
aVI then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.
p81
aVAnd my dad came home one day
p82
aVand announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.
p83
aVAnd what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,
p84
aVbut that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.
p85
aVAnd knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.
p86
aVBut for a young man that made a real impression on me,
p87
aVthat one never knows how much time one really has.
p88
aVSo I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.
p89
aVI started a couple of businesses
p90
aVthat I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.
p91
aa(lp92
VOne of those businesses was a computer rental business
p93
aVcalled Micros on the Move,
p94
aVwhich is very well named,
p95
aVbecause people kept stealing the computers.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVSo I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,
p98
aVso I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.
p99
aVAnd while I was there, I made friends with a fellow
p100
aVnamed Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize
p101
aVfor this. This is a photo from the old days.
p102
aVAnd just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me
p103
aVwith this idea to help people
p104
aVbuy and sell things online with each other.
p105
aVAnd with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,
p106
aVI said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVAnd needless to say, I was right.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VBut right after that, Pierre \u2014 in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs
p112
aVto build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.
p113
aVThe company went public two years later
p114
aVand is today one of the best known companies in the world.
p115
aVHundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.
p116
aVBut for me, personally, it was a real change.
p117
aVI went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto
p118
aVand living off their leftovers,
p119
aVto all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.
p120
aVAnd I wanted to figure out how I could
p121
aVtake the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd around that time, I met John Gardner,
p124
aVwho is a remarkable man.
p125
aVHe was the architect of the Great Society programs
p126
aVunder Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.
p127
aVAnd I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,
p128
aVor anyone could do, to make a difference
p129
aVin the long-term issues facing humanity.
p130
aVAnd John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.
p131
aVBet on good people doing good things."
p132
aVAnd that really resonated with me.
p133
aa(lp134
VI started a foundation
p135
aVto bet on these good people doing good things.
p136
aVThese leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,
p137
aVwho are using business skills in a very leveraged way
p138
aVto solve social problems.
p139
aVPeople today we call social entrepreneurs.
p140
aVAnd to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,
p141
aVwho started the Grameen Bank,
p142
aVhas lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,
p143
aVwon the Nobel Peace Prize.
p144
aVBut there's also a lot of people that you don't know.
p145
aVFolks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,
p146
aVbecause she felt girls' education was lagging.
p147
aVAnd she started it about 10 years ago,
p148
aVand today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.
p149
aVAnd somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,
p150
aVwho started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,
p151
aVand whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,
p152
aValso known as black fever.
p153
aVAnd by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,
p154
aVwhich is really a scourge in the developing world.
p155
aVAnd so this is one way to bet
p156
aVon good people doing good things.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change
p159
aVthat I find really is powerful.
p160
aVIt's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."
p161
aVAnd invest: if you see good people doing good things,
p162
aVinvest in them. Invest in their organizations,
p163
aVor in business. Invest in these folks.
p164
aVConnecting them together through conferences \u2014
p165
aVlike a TED \u2014 brings so many powerful connections,
p166
aVor through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship
p167
aVthat my foundation does at Oxford every year.
p168
aVAnd celebrate them: tell their stories,
p169
aVbecause not only are there good people doing good work,
p170
aVbut their stories can help close these gaps of hope.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,
p173
aVthat really got me back to thinking when I was a kid
p174
aVand wanted to tell stories to get people involved
p175
aVin the issues that affect us all.
p176
aVAnd a light bulb went off,
p177
aVwhich was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.
p178
aVAnd then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,
p179
aVwhat about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?
p180
aVAnd I thought about the films that inspired me,
p181
aVfilms like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List."
p182
aVAnd I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.
p183
aVAnd there really wasn't a specific company
p184
aVthat was focused on the public interest.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles
p187
aVto talk about the idea of a pro-social media company
p188
aVand I was met with a lot of encouragement.
p189
aVOne of the lines of encouragement
p190
aVthat I heard over and over was,
p191
aV"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,
p192
aVwho think you're going to come to this town and make movies."
p193
aVAnd then of course, there was the other adage.
p194
aV"The surest way to become a millionaire
p195
aVis to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VUndeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions
p199
aVwith the vision to be a global media company
p200
aVfocused on the public interest.
p201
aVAnd our mission is to produce entertainment
p202
aVthat creates and inspires social change.
p203
aVAnd we don't just want people to see our movies
p204
aVand say, that was fun, and forget about it.
p205
aVWe want them to actually get involved in the issues.
p206
aVIn 2005, we launched our first slate of films,
p207
aV"Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana"
p208
aVand "Good Night and Good Luck."
p209
aVAnd much to my surprise, they were noticed.
p210
aa(lp211
VWe ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.
p212
aVAnd it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.
p213
aVPerhaps more importantly,
p214
aVtens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs
p215
aVand the activism programs
p216
aVthat we created to go around the movies.
p217
aVAnd we had an online component of that,
p218
aVour community sect called Participate.net.
p219
aVBut with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the
p220
aVSierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,
p221
aVthere was actually something they could do to make a difference.
p222
aa(lp223
VOne of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actually
p224
aVkind of a box office disaster.
p225
aVBut it was a film that starred Charlize Theron
p226
aVand it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,
p227
aVdomestic violence and so on.
p228
aVAnd we released the film at the same time that
p229
aVthe Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.
p230
aVAnd with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,
p231
aVand with our social sector partners,
p232
aVlike the National Organization of Women,
p233
aVthe film was widely credited
p234
aVwith influencing the successful renewal of the act.
p235
aVAnd that to me, spoke volumes, because it's \u2014
p236
aVthe film started about a true-life story
p237
aVabout a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,
p238
aVled to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,
p239
aVand the Violence Against Women Act and others.
p240
aVAnd then the movie about this person doing these things,
p241
aVthen led to this greater renewal.
p242
aVAnd so again,
p243
aVit goes back to betting on good people doing good things.
p244
aa(lp245
VSpeaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al \u2014
p246
aVI first saw Al do his slide show presentation
p247
aVon global warming in May of 2005.
p248
aVAt that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.
p249
aVI thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.
p250
aVAnd after we saw his slide show,
p251
aVit became clear that it was much more urgent.
p252
aVAnd so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and
p253
aVwith Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,
p254
aVand Davis Guggenheim,
p255
aVwho was running documentaries for Participant at the time.
p256
aVAnd with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,
p257
aVbecause we felt that we could get the message out there
p258
aVfar more quickly than having Al go around the world,
p259
aVspeaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,
p262
aVthat nobody knows nothing about anything.
p263
aVAnd I really thought this was going to be
p264
aVa straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.
p265
aVAnd so it was a great shock to all of us
p266
aVwhen the film really captured the public interest,
p267
aVand today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,
p268
aVand most of Scandinavia.
p269
aVWe've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
p270
aVand it's really changed the debate on global warming.
p271
aVIt was also a pretty good year for this guy.
p272
aVWe now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd for Participant, this is just the start.
p276
aVEverything we do looks at the major issues in the world.
p277
aVAnd we have 10 films in production right now,
p278
aVand dozens others in development.
p279
aVI'll quickly talk about a few coming up.
p280
aVOne is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.
p281
aVAnd it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and
p282
aVhow he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
p283
aVAnd we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"
p284
aVbased on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.
p285
aVAnd we think once people see these films,
p286
aVthey'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world
p287
aVand the Middle East in general.
p288
aa(lp289
VWe premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.
p290
aVIt's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,
p291
aVAbby Hoffman and crew,
p292
aVand, again, a story about a small group of individuals
p293
aVwho did make change in the world.
p294
aVAnd a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter
p295
aVand his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.
p296
aVAnd in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,
p297
aVwhich, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial \u2014
p298
aV(Laughter)
p299
aV\u2014 which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.
p300
aa(lp301
VIn closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity
p302
aVto make change in their own way.
p303
aVAnd all the people in this room
p304
aVhave done so through their business lives,
p305
aVor their philanthropic work, or their other interests.
p306
aVAnd one thing that I've learned
p307
aVis that there's never one right way to make change.
p308
aVOne can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,
p309
aVor a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,
p310
aVbut every one of us is all of those things and more.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd I believe if we do these things,
p313
aVwe can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.
p314
aVAnd I can imagine, if we do this,
p315
aVthe headlines in 10 years might read something like these:
p316
aV"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,"
p317
aV"U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" \u2014
p318
aV(Applause)
p319
aV\u2014 "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate
p320
aV10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence."
p321
aV(Applause)
p322
aVAnd I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."
p323
aV(Laughter)
p324
aVAnd finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,
p325
aVnow obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.
p326
aVAnd I believe that, working together,
p327
aVwe can make all of these things happen.
p328
aVAnd I want to thank you all for having me here today.
p329
aVIt's been a real honor. Thank you.
p330
aV(Applause)
p331
aVOh, thank you.

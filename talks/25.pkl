VI'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today
p5
aVare some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance
p6
aVwith all the things that have been talked about the last two days.
p7
aVSo many different points of resonance
p8
aVthat it's going to be difficult to bring them all up,
p9
aVbut I'll try to do my best.
p10
aVDoes anybody remember these?
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VOK, so these are LP records and they've been replaced, right?
p15
aVThey've been swept away over the last two decades
p16
aVby these types of world-flattening digitization technologies, right?
p17
aVAnd I think it was best witnessed
p18
aVwhen Thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today.
p19
aVWhat's happened in the music world is there's a culture,
p20
aVor an ecosystem that's been created
p21
aVthat, if you take some words from Apple,
p22
aVthe catchphrase \u2014 that we create, rip, mix and burn.
p23
aVWhat I mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed
p24
aVto create new music and musical ideas.
p25
aVAnyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas,
p26
aVuse them in innovative ways.
p27
aVAnyone is allowed to mix them in different types of ways,
p28
aVdraw connections between musical ideas,
p29
aVand people can burn them or create final products and continue the circle.
p30
aVAnd what that's done is it's created, like I said,
p31
aVa vibrant community that's very inclusive,
p32
aVwith people continually working to connect musical ideas,
p33
aVinnovate them and keep things constantly up to date.
p34
aVToday's hit single is not last year's hit single.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut I'm not here to talk about music today.
p37
aVI'm here to talk about books.
p38
aVIn particular, textbooks and the kind of educational materials
p39
aVthat we use every day in school.
p40
aVHas anyone here ever been to school?
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VOK, does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools,
p45
aVaround the world?
p46
aVI'm not going to spend too much time on that,
p47
aVbut what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects
p48
aVthat appear when an author publishes a book.
p49
aVThat in fact, the publishing process \u2014
p50
aVjust because of the fact that it's complicated,
p51
aVit's heavy, books are expensive \u2014
p52
aVcreates a sort of a wall between authors of books
p53
aVand the ultimate users of books,
p54
aVbe they teachers, students or just general readers.
p55
aVAnd this is even more true if you happen to speak a language
p56
aVother than one of the world's major languages, and especially English.
p57
aVI'm going to call these people below the barrier "shutouts"
p58
aVbecause they're really shut out of the process
p59
aVof being able to share their knowledge with the world.
p60
aVAnd so what I want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas
p61
aVthat we've seen in the musical culture
p62
aVand try to bring these towards reinventing the way
p63
aVwe think about writing books, using them and teaching from them.
p64
aVSo, that's what I'd like to talk about
p65
aVand, really, how we get from where we are now
p66
aVto where we need to go.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment.
p69
aVImagine taking all the world's books.
p70
aVOK, everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages.
p71
aVSo, liberating these pages
p72
aVand imagine digitizing them and then storing them
p73
aVin a vast, interconnected, global repository.
p74
aVThink of it as a massive iTunes for book-type content.
p75
aVAnd then take that material and imagine making it all open,
p76
aVso that people can modify it, play with it, improve it.
p77
aVImagine making it free,
p78
aVso that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge,
p79
aVand imagine using information technology
p80
aVso that you can update this content, improve it, play with it,
p81
aVon a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years.
p82
aVInstead of editions of a book coming out every two years,
p83
aVimagine them coming out every 25 seconds.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo, imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this.
p86
aVSo that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors,
p87
aVbut all the people who could be or want to be authors
p88
aVin all the different languages of the world,
p89
aVand I think if you could do this, it would be called \u2014
p90
aVI'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem.
p91
aVSo, really, this is the dream,
p92
aVand in a sense what you can think of it
p93
aVis we're trying to enable anyone in the world,
p94
aVI mean anyone in the world \u2014
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
Vto be their own educational DJ,
p99
aVcreating educational materials, sharing them with the world,
p100
aVconstantly innovating on them.
p101
aVSo, this is the dream.
p102
aa(lp103
VIn fact, this dream is actually being realized.
p104
aVOver the last six-and-a-half years,
p105
aVwe've been working really hard at Rice University
p106
aVon a project called Connexions,
p107
aVand so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk
p108
aVis just tell you a little bit
p109
aVabout what people are doing with Connexions,
p110
aVwhich you can kind of think of as the counterpoint
p111
aVto Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday,
p112
aVwhere they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world.
p113
aVWe're working on the open-source tools
p114
aVand the content.
p115
aVSo, that's sort of to put it in perspective here.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo, create.
p118
aVWhat are some of the people that are using these kind of tools?
p119
aVWell, the first thing is,
p120
aVthere's a community of engineering professors,
p121
aVfrom Cambridge to Kyoto,
p122
aVwho are developing engineering content in electrical engineering
p123
aVto develop what you can think of as a massive, super textbook
p124
aVthat covers the entire area of electrical engineering.
p125
aVAnd not only that \u2014
p126
aVit can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions.
p127
aVIf people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out \u2014
p128
aVa private music teacher and mom from Champagne, Illinois,
p129
aVwho wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world,
p130
aVon how to teach kids how to play music \u2014
p131
aVHer material is now used over 600,000 times per month.
p132
aVTremendous use.
p133
aVIn fact, a lot of this use coming from United States K-12 schools,
p134
aVbecause anyone who's involved in a school scale back,
p135
aVthe first thing that's cut is the music curriculum.
p136
aVAnd so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst
p137
aVfor this kind of open, free content.
p138
aVA lot of teachers are using this stuff.
p139
aa(lp140
VWhat about ripping? What about copying, reusing?
p141
aVA team of volunteers at the University of Texas at El Paso \u2014
p142
aVgraduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas.
p143
aVAnd within about a week,
p144
aVhaving this be some of our most popular material
p145
aVin widespread use all over Latin America, and in particular in Mexico,
p146
aVbecause of the open, extensible nature of this.
p147
aVPeople, volunteers and even companies
p148
aVthat are translating materials into Asian languages
p149
aVlike Chinese, Japanese and Thai,
p150
aVto spread the knowledge even further.
p151
aa(lp152
VOK, what about people who are mixing?
p153
aVWhat does "mixing" mean?
p154
aV"Mixing" means building customized courses,
p155
aVmeans building customized books.
p156
aVCompanies like National Instruments,
p157
aVwho are embedding very powerful, interactive simulations
p158
aVinto the materials,
p159
aVso that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook
p160
aVto an experience
p161
aVthat all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with
p162
aVand play around with and actually learn as you do.
p163
aa(lp164
VWe've been working with Teachers Without Borders,
p165
aVwho are very interested in mixing our materials.
p166
aVThey're going to be using Connexions as their platform
p167
aVto develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach
p168
aVin 84 countries around the world.
p169
aVTWB is currently in Iraq,
p170
aVtraining 20,000 teachers supported by USAID.
p171
aVAnd to them, this idea of being able to remix
p172
aVand customize to the local context is extraordinarily important,
p173
aVbecause just providing free content to people
p174
aVhas actually been likened by people in the developing world
p175
aVto a kind of cultural imperialism \u2014
p176
aVthat if you don't empower people
p177
aVwith the ability to re-contextualize the material,
p178
aVtranslate it into their own language and take ownership of it,
p179
aVit's not good.
p180
aa(lp181
VOK, other organizations we've been working with, UC Merced \u2014
p182
aVpeople know about UC Merced.
p183
aVIt's a new university in California, in the Central Valley,
p184
aVworking very closely with community colleges.
p185
aVThey're actually developing
p186
aVa lot of their science and engineering curriculum
p187
aVto spread widely around the world in our system.
p188
aVAnd they're also trying to develop all of their software tools
p189
aVcompletely open-source.
p190
aVWe've been working with AMD, which has a project called 50x15,
p191
aVwhich is trying to bring Internet connectivity
p192
aVto 50 percent of the world's population by 2015.
p193
aVWe're going to be providing content to them
p194
aVin a whole range of different languages.
p195
aVAnd we've also been working with a number of other organizations.
p196
aVIn particular, a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation,
p197
aVwho have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content.
p198
aa(lp199
VOK, burn \u2014 I think this is, sort of, quite interesting.
p200
aV"Burn" is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation
p201
aVof one of these courses.
p202
aVAnd I think a lot of you received \u2014
p203
aVI think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack.
p204
aVA little present for you.
p205
aVJust to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook.
p206
aVIt's about 300 pages long, hardbound.
p207
aVThis costs \u2014 anybody guess?
p208
aVHow much would it cost in a bookstore?
p209
aa(lp210
V(Audience) 65 dollars.
p211
aa(lp212
VRichard Baraniuk: OK. This costs 22 dollars to the student.
p213
aVWhy does it cost 22 dollars?
p214
aVBecause it's published on demand
p215
aVand it's developed from this repository of open materials.
p216
aVIf this book were to be published by a regular publisher,
p217
aVit would cost at least 122 dollars.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo what we're seeing
p220
aVis moving this burning or publication process
p221
aVfrom the regular, sort of single-authored book
p222
aVtowards community-authored materials
p223
aVthat are modular, that are customized to each individual class
p224
aVand published on demand very inexpensively,
p225
aVeither pushed out through Amazon
p226
aVor published directly through an on-demand press, like QOOP.
p227
aVAnd I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area
p228
aVbecause there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing.
p229
aVWe're not talking about the Harry Potter end,
p230
aVright at the left side.
p231
aVWe're talking about books
p232
aVon hypergeometric partial differential equations.
p233
aVBooks that might sell 100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.
p234
aVThere is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail
p235
aVto sustain open projects like ours,
p236
aVbut also to sustain this new emergence of on-demand publishers,
p237
aVlike QOOP, who produced these two books.
p238
aVAnd I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk
p239
aVis that there's an impending cut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation,
p240
aVthat's going to be happening in the publishing industry.
p241
aVAnd it's going to reach a crescendo over the next few years,
p242
aVand I think that it's for our benefit, really, and for the world's benefit.
p243
aa(lp244
VOK, so what are the enablers?
p245
aVWhat's really making all of this happen?
p246
aVThere's tons of technology,
p247
aVand the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML.
p248
aVHow many people know about XML?
p249
aVOh, great.
p250
aVSo it's the future of the web, right?
p251
aVIt's semantic representation of content.
p252
aVAnd what you can really think of XML in this case
p253
aVis it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages.
p254
aVRemember we took the book, tore the pages out?
p255
aVWell, what the XML is going to do
p256
aVis it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks.
p257
aVXML are the nubs on the Lego
p258
aVthat allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways,
p259
aVand it provides us a framework to share content.
p260
aVSo, it lets you take this ecosystem
p261
aVin its primordial state of all this content,
p262
aVall the pages you've torn out of books,
p263
aVand create highly sophisticated learning machines:
p264
aVbooks, courses, course packs.
p265
aa(lp266
VIt gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience
p267
aVto each individual student,
p268
aVso that every student can have a book or a course
p269
aVthat's customized to their learning style, their context,
p270
aVtheir language and the things that excite them.
p271
aVIt lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways,
p272
aVand surprising new ways.
p273
aVIt lets you interconnect ideas,
p274
aVindicating how fields relate to each other.
p275
aVAnd I'll just give you my personal story.
p276
aVWe came up with this six-and-a-half years ago
p277
aVbecause I teach the stuff in the red box.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd my day job, as Chris said \u2014 I'm an electrical engineering professor.
p280
aVI teach signal processing
p281
aVand my challenge was to show that this math \u2014
p282
aVWow, about half of you have already fallen asleep
p283
aVjust looking at the equation.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VBut this seemingly dry math
p288
aVis actually the center of this tremendously powerful web
p289
aVthat links technology \u2014
p290
aVthat links really cool applications like music synthesizers
p291
aVto tremendous economic opportunities,
p292
aVbut also governed by intellectual property.
p293
aVAnd the thing that I realized
p294
aVis there was no way that I, as an engineer,
p295
aVcould write this book that would get all of this across.
p296
aVWe needed a community to do it
p297
aVand we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas.
p298
aVAnd I think that really, in a sense, what we're trying to do
p299
aVis make Minsky's dream come to a reality,
p300
aVwhere you can imagine all the books in a library
p301
aVactually starting to talk to each other.
p302
aVAnd people who are teachers out here \u2014 whoever taught, you know this \u2014
p303
aVit's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about.
p304
aa(lp305
VOK, back to math.
p306
aVImagine \u2014 this is possible:
p307
aVthat every single equation that you click on in one of your new e-texts
p308
aVis something that you're going to be able to explore and experiment with.
p309
aVSo imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade.
p310
aVYou can click on every single equation
p311
aVand bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it,
p312
aVtinker with it, understand it.
p313
aVBecause we really don't understand until we do.
p314
aVThe same type of mark-up, like MathML, for chemistry.
p315
aVImagine chemistry textbooks
p316
aVthat actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed.
p317
aVImagine Music XML
p318
aVthat actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music,
p319
aVplay with it, understand it.
p320
aVIt's no wonder that everybody's getting into it, right?
p321
aVEven the three wise men.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VOK, the second big enabler, and this is where I told a big lie.
p326
aVThe second big enabler is intellectual property.
p327
aVBecause, in fact, I got up here
p328
aVand I talked about how great the music culture is.
p329
aVWe can share and rip, mix and burn, but in fact, that's all illegal.
p330
aVAnd we would be accused of [piracy] for doing that,
p331
aVbecause this music has been propertized.
p332
aVIt's now owned, much of it by big industries.
p333
aVSo, really, the key thing here is we can't let this happen.
p334
aVWe can't let this Napster thing happen here.
p335
aVSo, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning.
p336
aVAnd what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework
p337
aVthat makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable.
p338
aVAnd the inspiration here is taken from open-source software.
p339
aVThings like Linux and the GPL.
p340
aa(lp341
VThe Creative Commons licenses.
p342
aVHow many people have heard of creative commons?
p343
aVIf you have not, you must learn about it.
p344
aVCreativecommons.org.
p345
aVAt the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions
p346
aVand in lots of other projects,
p347
aVyou can find their logo.
p348
aVClicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no-nonsense,
p349
aVhuman-readable document, a deed,
p350
aVthat tells you exactly what you can do with this content.
p351
aVIn fact, you're free to share it, to do all of these things:
p352
aVto copy it, to change it, even to make commercial use of it,
p353
aVas long as you attribute the author.
p354
aVBecause in academic publishing and much of educational publishing,
p355
aVit's really this idea of sharing knowledge
p356
aVand making impact.
p357
aVThat's why people write, not necessarily making bucks.
p358
aVWe're not talking about Harry Potter, right?
p359
aVWe're at the long tail end here.
p360
aVBehind that is the legal code, very carefully constructed.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd Creative Commons is taking off \u2014
p363
aVover 43 million things out there,
p364
aVlicensed with a Creative Commons license.
p365
aVNot just text,
p366
aVbut music, images, video.
p367
aVAnd there's actually a tremendous uptake
p368
aVof the number of people that are actually licensing music
p369
aVto make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-sampling,
p370
aVripping, mixing, burning and sharing.
p371
aa(lp372
VOK, I'd like to conclude with just the last few points.
p373
aVSo, we've built this idea of a commons.
p374
aVPeople are using it.
p375
aVWe get over 500,000 unique visitors per month, just to our particular site.
p376
aVMIT OpenCourseWare, which is another large open-content site,
p377
aVgets a similar number of hits.
p378
aVBut how do we protect this?
p379
aVHow do we protect it into the future?
p380
aVAnd the first thing that people are probably thinking
p381
aVis quality control, right?
p382
aVBecause we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons.
p383
aVAnybody can contribute anything.
p384
aVSo that could be a problem.
p385
aa(lp386
VIt didn't take long until people started contributing materials,
p387
aVfor example, on lingerie,
p388
aVwhich is actually a pretty good module.
p389
aVThe only problem is it's plagiarized from a major French feminist journal,
p390
aVand when you go to the supposed course website,
p391
aVit points to a lingerie-selling website.
p392
aVSo this is a little bit of a problem.
p393
aVSo we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control
p394
aVand this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in.
p395
aVYou come to TED. Why do you come to TED?
p396
aVBecause Chris and his team have ensured
p397
aVthat things are very, very high quality, right?
p398
aVAnd so we need to be able to do the same thing.
p399
aVAnd we need to be able to design structures,
p400
aVand what we're doing is designing social software
p401
aVto enable anyone to build their own peer review process,
p402
aVand we call these things "lenses."
p403
aVAnd basically what they allow
p404
aVis anyone out there can develop their own peer-review process,
p405
aVso that they can focus on the content in the repository
p406
aVthat they think is really important.
p407
aVAnd you can think of TED as a potential lens.
p408
aa(lp409
VSo I'd just like to end by saying:
p410
aVyou can really view this as a call to action.
p411
aVConnexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge.
p412
aVAll of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge,
p413
aVand what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you
p414
aVto contribute to this project and other projects of its type,
p415
aVbecause I think together we can truly change the landscape
p416
aVof education and educational publishing.
p417
aa(lp418
VSo, thanks very much.

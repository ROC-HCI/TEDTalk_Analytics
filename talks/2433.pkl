VThere are a few things that all of us need.
p5
aVWe all need air to breathe.
p6
aVWe need clean water to drink.
p7
aVWe need food to eat. We need shelter and love.
p8
aVYou know. Love is great, too.
p9
aVAnd we all need a safe place to pee.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter) Yeah?
p12
aa(lp13
VAs a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary,
p14
aVif I could change the world tomorrow
p15
aVto make it easier for me to navigate,
p16
aVthe very first thing I would do
p17
aVis blink and create single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms
p18
aVin all public places.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Applause)
p21
aVTrans people and trans issues,
p22
aVthey've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately.
p23
aVAnd this is a great and necessary thing,
p24
aVbut most of that attention has been focused
p25
aVon a very few individuals,
p26
aVmost of whom are kinda rich
p27
aVand pretty famous,
p28
aVand probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee
p29
aVin between classes at their community college,
p30
aVor where they're going to get changed into their gym strip
p31
aVat their public high school.
p32
aVFame and money insulates these television star trans people
p33
aVfrom most of the everyday challenges
p34
aVthat the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis.
p35
aa(lp36
VPublic bathrooms.
p37
aVThey've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember,
p38
aVfirst when I was just a little baby tomboy
p39
aVand then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, today as a trans person, public bathrooms and change rooms
p44
aVare where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed.
p45
aVI've often been verbally attacked behind their doors.
p46
aVI've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up.
p47
aVI've been stared at, screamed at, whispered about,
p48
aVand one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse
p49
aVthat from the looks of the shiner I took home that day
p50
aVI am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change
p51
aVand a large hard candy collection.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd I know what some of you are thinking,
p56
aVand you're mostly right.
p57
aVI can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days.
p58
aVBut that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas, does it?
p59
aVAnd I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man.
p60
aVI'm a trans person.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd now we've got these fearmongering politicians
p63
aVthat keep trying to pass these bathroom bills.
p64
aVHave you heard about these?
p65
aVThey try to legislate to try and force people like myself
p66
aVto use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate
p67
aVaccording to the gender I was assigned at birth.
p68
aVAnd if these politicians ever get their way,
p69
aVin Arizona or California or Florida
p70
aVor just last week in Houston, Texas,
p71
aVor Ottawa,
p72
aVwell then, using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table,
p75
aVI can't help but wonder, you know,
p76
aVjust who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right?
p77
aVPanty checks?
p78
aVReally.
p79
aVGenital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools?
p80
aVThere's no legal or ethical or plausible way
p81
aVto enforce laws like these anyway.
p82
aVThey exist only to foster fear
p83
aVand promote transphobia.
p84
aVThey don't make anyone safer.
p85
aVBut they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd meanwhile, our trans children suffer.
p88
aVThey drop out of school, or they opt out of life altogether.
p89
aVTrans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth
p90
aVface additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms,
p91
aVbut also universities,
p92
aVhospitals, libraries.
p93
aVDon't even get me started on how they treat us in airports.
p94
aa(lp95
VIf we don't move now
p96
aVto make sure that these places
p97
aVare truly open and accessible to everyone,
p98
aVthen we just need to get honest
p99
aVand quit calling them public places.
p100
aVWe need to just admit
p101
aVthat they are really only open for people
p102
aVwho fit neatly into one of two gender boxes,
p103
aVwhich I do not.
p104
aVI never have.
p105
aVAnd this starts very early.
p106
aa(lp107
VI know a little girl. She's the daughter of a friend of mine.
p108
aVShe's a self-identified tomboy.
p109
aVI'm talking about cowboy boots
p110
aVand Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards.
p111
aVOne time I asked her what her favorite color was.
p112
aVShe told me, "Camouflage."
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VSo that awesome little kid,
p117
aVshe came home from school last October
p118
aVfrom her half day of preschool
p119
aVwith soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her
p120
aVwhen she tried to use the girls' bathroom.
p121
aVAnd the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom.
p122
aVAnd she had drank two glasses of that red juice
p123
aVat the Halloween party,
p124
aVand I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good.
p125
aVAnd she couldn't hold her pee any longer.
p126
aa(lp127
VHer and her classmates were four years old.
p128
aVThey already felt empowered enough
p129
aVto police her use of the so-called public bathrooms.
p130
aVShe was four years old.
p131
aVShe had already been taught the brutal lesson
p132
aVthat there was no bathroom door at preschool
p133
aVwith a sign on it that welcomed people like her.
p134
aVShe'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem,
p135
aVand that problem started with her
p136
aVand was hers alone.
p137
aVSo my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter,
p138
aVand I did.
p139
aVI wanted to tell her
p140
aVthat me and her mom were going to march on down
p141
aVand talk to that school, and the problem was going to go away,
p142
aVbut I knew that wasn't true.
p143
aVI wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older,
p144
aVbut I couldn't.
p145
aVSo I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened,
p146
aVasked her to tell me how it made her feel.
p147
aV"Mad and sad,"
p148
aVshe told me.
p149
aVSo I told her
p150
aVthat she wasn't alone
p151
aVand that it wasn't right what had happened to her,
p152
aVand then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before.
p153
aVI said yes, I had,
p154
aVbut not for a really long time.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VWhich of course was a lie,
p159
aVbecause you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43,
p160
aVand sometimes you just, I don't know, you pee a little bit
p161
aVwhen you cough or sneeze,
p162
aVwhen you're running upstairs, or you're stretching.
p163
aVDon't lie.
p164
aVIt happens. Right?
p165
aVShe doesn't need to know that, I figure.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VI told her, when you get older, your bladder is going to grow bigger, too.
p170
aVWhen you get old like me,
p171
aVyou're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer,
p172
aVI promised her.
p173
aa(lp174
V"Until you can get home?"
p175
aVshe asked me.
p176
aa(lp177
VI said, "Yes,
p178
aVuntil you can get home."
p179
aVShe seemed to take some comfort in that.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms
p182
aVwith a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes.
p183
aVWe can't change the world overnight
p184
aVfor our children,
p185
aVbut we can give them a safe and private place
p186
aVto escape that world,
p187
aVif only for just a minute.
p188
aVThis we can do.
p189
aVSo let's just do it.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now
p192
aValready coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority,
p193
aVor it's too expensive,
p194
aVor telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee
p195
aVor get changed in
p196
aVsupports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality,
p197
aVor your masculinity,
p198
aVor your religious beliefs,
p199
aVthen let me just appeal
p200
aVto the part of your heart that probably, hopefully,
p201
aVdoes care about the rest of the population.
p202
aVIf you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me,
p203
aVthen what about women and girls
p204
aVwith body image issues?
p205
aVWhat about anyone with body image stuff going on?
p206
aVWhat about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates,
p207
aVwhose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey?
p208
aVOh, grade eight,
p209
aVwhat a cruel master you can be.
p210
aVRight?
p211
aVWhat about people with anxiety issues?
p212
aVWhat about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there?
p213
aVWhat about folks with bodies who, for whatever reason,
p214
aVdon't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like?
p215
aVHow many of us still feel shy
p216
aVor afraid to disrobe in front of our peers,
p217
aVand how many of us allow that fear
p218
aVto keep us from something as important
p219
aVas physical exercise?
p220
aVWould all those people not benefit
p221
aVfrom these single stall facilities?
p222
aa(lp223
VWe can't change transphobic minds overnight,
p224
aVbut we can give everybody
p225
aVa place to get changed in
p226
aVso that we can all get to work
p227
aVmaking the world safer
p228
aVfor all of us.
p229
aa(lp230
VThank you for listening.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
VThank you.

An award-winning author of eight collections of short stories, one novel, three CD&rsquo;s, four short films and a renowned performer, Ivan&rsquo;s first love is live storytelling. Over the last nineteen years, they have become an audience favorite at music, poetry, spoken word and writer&rsquo;s festivals from Anchorage to Amsterdam.</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">Ivan began performing in 1992, and in 1996 co-founded Taste This, a four person performance troupe that combined live music, storytelling and performance poetry to create a text-driven genre-busting collaborative exchange. Taste This toured North America extensively and in 1998 the four artists published Boys Like Her, a critically acclaimed book that took the stage show to the printed page. Boys Like Her sold out three editions and continues to be considered a notable Canadian contribution to the dialogue around gender identity and sexuality.</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">Ivan teamed up with Arsenal Pulp Press in 2000, and has since released nine more books. Close to Spiderman (2000), One Man&rsquo;s Trash (2002), Loose End (2005), Bow Grip (2006), The Slow Fix (2008), Missed Her (2010), Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme (2011), One In Every Crowd (2012) and Gender Failure (2014).&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">Ivan is still fascinated by the intersection of storytelling and music, and works with a number of well-established Canadian musicians, including pianist and composer Veda Hille, songwriter Dan Mangan, folk artist Rae Spoon, cellist Cris Derksen, and violinist Lyndell Montgomery. Ivan has released three CDs of storytelling with music, You&rsquo;re A Nation (2003) and You Are Here (2007) and Only Two Reasons (2010).</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">In 2001 Ivan landed a little gig teaching short fiction at Capilano University in North Vancouver. This little night school class led to an accidental discovery: Ivan loves to teach creative writing. Coyote continued to teach short fiction and classes and workshops, and in 2007 was invited to become Carleton University&rsquo;s writer-in-residence. While in Ottawa, Coyote taught a third year fiction class, and three memoir-writing classes for senior citizens. It was while teaching seniors that Ivan realized their true calling. Ivan strongly believes in listening to the stories of our elders, and encouraging them to write down their lives.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">Coyote has since been honoured to be the writer-in-residence at the Vancouver Public Library (2009), The Carol Shield&rsquo;s writer-in-residence at the University of Winnipeg (2011) and the writer-in-residence at The University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario (2012).&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">In addition to these literary and teaching accomplishments, Ivan continues to tour extensively throughout North America and Europe, telling stories not only to festival audiences but to high school students, social justice activists, adult literacy students and senior citizens all across the continent. Ivan believes in the transformative power of storytelling, and that collecting and remembering oral history not only preserves a vital part of our families and where we come from, but that a good story can help inspire us to invent a better future.</span></p>", "slug": "ivan_coyote", "whotheyare": "Ivan Coyote believes that a good story can help inspire us to invent a better future.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 2929, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/a76d19b46a14642ffb92adfc449764067600a155_254x191.jpg"}], "current_talk": 2433, "description": "There are a few things that we all need: fresh air, water, food, shelter, love ... and a safe place to pee.

class=\\"s1\\">Ivan Coyote was born and raised in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory. An award-winning author of eight collections of short stories, one novel, three CD&rsquo;s, four short films and a renowned performer, Ivan&rsquo;s first love is live storytelling. Over the last nineteen years, they have become an audience favorite at music, poetry, spoken word and writer&rsquo;s festivals from Anchorage to Amsterdam.</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">Ivan began performing in 1992, and in 1996 co-founded Taste This, a four person performance troupe that combined live music, storytelling and performance poetry to create a text-driven genre-busting collaborative exchange. Taste This toured North America extensively and in 1998 the four artists published Boys Like Her, a critically acclaimed book that took the stage show to the printed page. Boys Like Her sold out three editions and continues to be considered a notable Canadian contribution to the dialogue around gender identity and sexuality.</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">Ivan teamed up with Arsenal Pulp Press in 2000, and has since released nine more books. Close to Spiderman (2000), One Man&rsquo;s Trash (2002), Loose End (2005), Bow Grip (2006), The Slow Fix (2008), Missed Her (2010), Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme (2011), One In Every Crowd (2012) and Gender Failure (2014).&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">Ivan is still fascinated by the intersection of storytelling and music, and works with a number of well-established Canadian musicians, including pianist and composer Veda Hille, songwriter Dan Mangan, folk artist Rae Spoon, cellist Cris Derksen, and violinist Lyndell Montgomery. Ivan has released three CDs of storytelling with music, You&rsquo;re A Nation (2003) and You Are Here (2007) and Only Two Reasons (2010).</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">In 2001 Ivan landed a little gig teaching short fiction at Capilano University in North Vancouver. This little night school class led to an accidental discovery: Ivan loves to teach creative writing. Coyote continued to teach short fiction and classes and workshops, and in 2007 was invited to become Carleton University&rsquo;s writer-in-residence. While in Ottawa, Coyote taught a third year fiction class, and three memoir-writing classes for senior citizens. It was while teaching seniors that Ivan realized their true calling. Ivan strongly believes in listening to the stories of our elders, and encouraging them to write down their lives.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">Coyote has since been honoured to be the writer-in-residence at the Vancouver Public Library (2009), The Carol Shield&rsquo;s writer-in-residence at the University of Winnipeg (2011) and the writer-in-residence at The University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario (2012).&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=\\"p1\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">In addition to these literary and teaching accomplishments, Ivan continues to tour extensively throughout North America and Europe, telling stories not only to festival audiences but to high school students, social justice activists, adult literacy students and senior citizens all across the continent. Ivan believes in the transformative power of storytelling, and that collecting and remembering oral history not only preserves a vital part of our families and where we come from, but that a good story can help inspire us to invent a better future.</span></p>", "slug": "ivan_coyote", "whotheyare": "Ivan Coyote believes that a good story can help inspire us to invent a better future.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 2929, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/a76d19b46a14642ffb92adfc449764067600a155_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Why we need gender-neutral bathrooms", "take_action": null, "comments": 27052, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/78a0b6f8b75ee4e7a27a542c1fb80f5a929711e6_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "There are a few things that we all need: fresh air, water, food, shelter, love ... and a safe place to pee.

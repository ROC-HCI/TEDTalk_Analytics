VI hope you'll understand my English.
p5
aVIn the mornings it is terrible, and the afternoon is worst.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVDuring many years, I made some speeches starting with this
p8
aVsaying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution."
p9
aVAnd more and more, I'm convinced that
p10
aVit's not only a solution for a country,
p11
aVbut it's a solution for the problem of climate change.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities.
p14
aVI'm working in cities for almost 40 years,
p15
aVand where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big,
p16
aVor the other mayors say, "We don't have financial resources,"
p17
aVI would like to say
p18
aVfrom the experience I had: every city in the world
p19
aVcan be improved in less than three years.
p20
aVThere's no matter of scale. It's not a question of scale,
p21
aVit's not a question of financial resources.
p22
aVEvery problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility
p23
aVand also a design.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo to start, I want to introduce some characters
p26
aVfrom a book I made for teenagers.
p27
aVThe best example of quality of life is the turtle
p28
aVbecause the turtle is an example of living and working together.
p29
aVAnd when you realize that the casque of the turtle
p30
aVlooks like an urban tessitura,
p31
aVand can we imagine, if we cut the casque of the turtle, how sad she's going to be?
p32
aVAnd that's what we're doing in our cities:
p33
aVliving here, working here, having leisure here.
p34
aVAnd most of the people are leaving the city
p35
aVand living outside of the city.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo, the other character is Otto, the automobile.
p38
aVHe is invited for a party \u2014 he never wants to leave.
p39
aVThe chairs are on the tables and still drinking,
p40
aVand he drinks a lot. (Laughter)
p41
aVAnd he coughs a lot. Very egotistical:
p42
aVhe carries only one or two people
p43
aVand he asks always for more infrastructure.
p44
aVFreeways.
p45
aVHe's a very demanding person.
p46
aVAnd on the other hand, Accordion, the friendly bus,
p47
aVhe carries 300 people \u2014
p48
aV275 in Sweden; 300 Brazilians. (Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VSpeaking about the design: every city has its own design.
p51
aVCuritiba, my city: three million in the metropolitan area,
p52
aV1,800,000 people in the city itself.
p53
aVCuritiba, Rio: it's like two birds kissing themselves.
p54
aVOaxaca, San Francisco \u2014 it's very easy:
p55
aVMarket Street, Van Ness and the waterfront.
p56
aVAnd every city has its own design.
p57
aVBut to make it happen, sometimes you have to propose a scenario
p58
aVand to propose a design \u2014
p59
aVan idea that everyone, or the large majority,
p60
aVwill help you to make it happen.
p61
aVAnd that's the structure of the city of Curitiba.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd it's an example of living and working together.
p64
aVAnd this is where we have more density;
p65
aVit's where we have more public transport.
p66
aVSo, this system started in '74. We started with 25,000 passengers a day,
p67
aVnow it's 2,200,000 passengers a day.
p68
aVAnd it took 25 years until another city ...
p69
aVwhich is Bogota, and they did a very good job.
p70
aVAnd now there's 83 cities all over the world that they
p71
aVare doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba.
p72
aVAnd one thing: it's important not for only your own city;
p73
aVevery city, besides its normal problems,
p74
aVthey have a very important role
p75
aVin being with the whole humanity.
p76
aVThat means mostly two main issues \u2014
p77
aVmobility and sustainability \u2014 are becoming very important for the cities.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd this is an articulated bus, double-articulated.
p80
aVAnd we are very close to my house.
p81
aVYou can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there.
p82
aVAnd that's the evolution of the system.
p83
aVWhat in the design that made the difference
p84
aVis the boarding tubes:
p85
aVthe boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway.
p86
aVThat's why, I'm trying to say,
p87
aVit's like metro-nizing the bus.
p88
aVThis is the design of the bus,
p89
aVand you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding.
p90
aVAnd for handicapped, they can use this as a normal system.
p91
aa(lp92
VWhat I'm trying to say is
p93
aVthe major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars \u2014
p94
aVmore than 50 percent \u2014 so when we depend only on cars, it's ...
p95
aV\u2014 that's why when we're talking about sustainability,
p96
aVit's not enough, green buildings.
p97
aVIt's not enough, a new materials.
p98
aVIt's not enough, new sources of energy.
p99
aVIt's the concept of the city, the design of the city,
p100
aVthat's also important, too. And also, how to teach the children.
p101
aVI'll speak on this later on.
p102
aa(lp103
VOur idea of mobility is trying
p104
aVto make the connections between all the systems.
p105
aVWe started in '83, proposing for the city of Rio
p106
aVhow to connect the subway with the bus.
p107
aVThe subway was against, of course.
p108
aVAnd 23 years after, they called us to develop \u2014 we're developing this idea.
p109
aVAnd you can understand how different it's going to be,
p110
aVthe image of Rio with the system \u2014
p111
aVone-minute frequency.
p112
aVAnd it's not Shanghai,
p113
aVit's not being colored during the day, only at night
p114
aVit will look this way.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd before you say it's a Norman Foster design,
p117
aVwe designed this in '83.
p118
aVAnd this is the model,
p119
aVhow it's going to work. So, it's the same system;
p120
aVthe vehicle is different. And that's the model.
p121
aVWhat I'm trying to say is, I'm not trying
p122
aVto prove which system of transport is better.
p123
aVI'm trying to say we have to combine
p124
aVall the systems, and with one condition:
p125
aVnever \u2014 if you have a subway, if you have surface systems,
p126
aVif you have any kind of system \u2014
p127
aVnever compete in the same space.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd coming back to the car, I always used to say
p130
aVthat the car is like your mother-in-law:
p131
aVyou have to have good relationship with her,
p132
aVbut she cannot command your life.
p133
aVSo, when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law,
p134
aVyou have a problem. (Laughter)
p135
aVSo, all the ideas about how to transform through design \u2014
p136
aVold quarries and open universities and botanic garden \u2014
p137
aVall of it's related to how we teach the children.
p138
aVAnd the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage.
p139
aVAnd after, the children teach their parents.
p140
aVAnd now we have 70 percent \u2014
p141
aVsince 20 years, it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world.
p142
aVSeven zero.
p143
aV(Applause)
p144
aVSo teach the children.
p145
aa(lp146
VI would like to say, if we want to have a sustainable world
p147
aVwe have to work with everything what's said,
p148
aVbut don't forget the cities and the children.
p149
aVI'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city,
p150
aVbecause you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day.
p151
aVYou should have always
p152
aVa structure of living and working together.
p153
aVTry to understand the sectors in the city
p154
aVthat could play different roles during the 24 hours.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnother issue is, a city's like our family portrait.
p157
aVWe don't rip our family portrait,
p158
aVeven if we don't like the nose of our uncle,
p159
aVbecause this portrait is you.
p160
aVAnd these are the references that we have in any city.
p161
aVThis is the main pedestrian mall;
p162
aVwe did it in 72 hours. Yes, you have to be fast.
p163
aVAnd these are the references from our ethnic contribution.
p164
aVThis is the Italian portal,
p165
aVthe Ukrainian park, the Polish park, the Japanese square, the German park.
p166
aVAll of a sudden, the Soviet Union, they split.
p167
aVAnd since we have people from
p168
aVUzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, [unclear],
p169
aVwe have to stop the program.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VDon't forget: creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget.
p173
aVIf you cut two zeros, it's much better.
p174
aVAnd this is the Wire Opera theater. We did it in two months.
p175
aVParks \u2014 old quarries that they were transformed into parks.
p176
aVQuarries once made the nature, and
p177
aVsometimes we took this and we transformed.
p178
aVAnd every part can be transformed;
p179
aVevery frog can be transformed in a prince.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo, in a city, you have to work fast.
p182
aVPlanning takes time. And I'm proposing urban acupuncture.
p183
aVThat means me, with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning.
p184
aVAnd this is an acupuncture note \u2014
p185
aVor I.M. Pei's. Some small ones
p186
aVcan make the city better.
p187
aVThe smallest park in New York, the most beautiful:
p188
aV32 meters.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo, I want just to end saying
p191
aVthat you can always propose new materials \u2014 new sustainable materials \u2014
p192
aVbut keep in mind that we have to work fast
p193
aVto the end, because we don't have the whole time to plan.
p194
aVAnd I think creativity, innovation is starting.
p195
aVAnd we cannot have all the answers.
p196
aVSo when you start \u2014
p197
aVand we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers \u2014
p198
aVit's important starting and having the contribution from people,
p199
aVand they could teach you
p200
aVif you're not in the right track.
p201
aa(lp202
VAt the end, I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song.
p203
aVOK?
p204
aVPlease, allow me just two minutes.
p205
aVYou're going to make the music and the rhythm.

For Jaime Lerner, it&#39;s measured in hours. As mayor of Curitiba, he transformed a gridlocked commercial artery into a spacious pedestrian mall over a long weekend, before skeptical merchants had time to finish reading their Monday papers. <br /><br />Since then he&#39;s become a hero not only to his fellow Brazilians, but also to the growing ranks of municipal planners seeking greener, more sustainable cities. His dictum that &quot;creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget&quot; has inspired a number of his unique solutions to urban problems, including sheltered boarding tubes to improve speed of bus transit; a garbage-for-food program allowing Curitibans to exchange bags of trash for bags of groceries; and trimming parkland grasses with herds of sheep.<br /><br />In addition to serving three terms as mayor of Curitiba, Lerner has twice been elected governor of Parana State in Brazil. His revolutionary career in urban planning and architecture has not only improved cities worldwide, but has also brought him international renown.

For Jaime Lerner, it&#39;s measured in hours. As mayor of Curitiba, he transformed a gridlocked commercial artery into a spacious pedestrian mall over a long weekend, before skeptical merchants had time to finish reading their Monday papers. <br /><br />Since then he&#39;s become a hero not only to his fellow Brazilians, but also to the growing ranks of municipal planners seeking greener, more sustainable cities. His dictum that &quot;creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget&quot; has inspired a number of his unique solutions to urban problems, including sheltered boarding tubes to improve speed of bus transit; a garbage-for-food program allowing Curitibans to exchange bags of trash for bags of groceries; and trimming parkland grasses with herds of sheep.<br /><br />In addition to serving three terms as mayor of Curitiba, Lerner has twice been elected governor of Parana State in Brazil. His revolutionary career in urban planning and architecture has not only improved cities worldwide, but has also brought him international renown. Among his many awards are the United Nations Environmental Award (1990), the Child and Peace Award from UNICEF (1996), and the 2001 World Technology Award for Transportation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "jaime_lerner", "whotheyare": "From building opera houses with wire to mapping the connection between the automobile and your mother-in-law, Jaime Lerner delights in discovering eccentric solutions to vexing urban problems.

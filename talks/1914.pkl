VIn 2007, I became the attorney general
p5
aVof the state of New Jersey.
p6
aVBefore that, I'd been a criminal prosecutor,
p7
aVfirst in the Manhattan district attorney's office,
p8
aVand then at the United States Department of Justice.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut when I became the attorney general,
p11
aVtwo things happened that changed  the way I see criminal justice.
p12
aVThe first is that I asked what I thought
p13
aVwere really basic questions.
p14
aVI wanted to understand who we were arresting,
p15
aVwho we were charging,
p16
aVand who we were putting in our nation's jails
p17
aVand prisons.
p18
aVI also wanted to understand
p19
aVif we were making decisions
p20
aVin a way that made us safer.
p21
aVAnd I couldn't get this information out.
p22
aVIt turned out that most big criminal justice agencies
p23
aVlike my own
p24
aVdidn't track the things that matter.
p25
aVSo after about a month of being incredibly frustrated,
p26
aVI walked down into a conference room
p27
aVthat was filled with detectives
p28
aVand stacks and stacks of case files,
p29
aVand the detectives were sitting there
p30
aVwith yellow legal pads taking notes.
p31
aVThey were trying to get the information
p32
aVI was looking for
p33
aVby going through case by case
p34
aVfor the past five years.
p35
aVAnd as you can imagine,
p36
aVwhen we finally got the results, they weren't good.
p37
aVIt turned out that we were doing
p38
aVa lot of low-level drug cases
p39
aVon the streets just around the corner
p40
aVfrom our office in Trenton.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe second thing that happened
p43
aVis that I spent the day in the Camden, New Jersey police department.
p44
aVNow, at that time, Camden, New Jersey,
p45
aVwas the most dangerous city in America.
p46
aVI ran the Camden Police Department because of that.
p47
aVI spent the day in the police department,
p48
aVand I was taken into a room with senior police officials,
p49
aVall of whom were working hard
p50
aVand trying very hard to reduce crime in Camden.
p51
aVAnd what I saw in that room,
p52
aVas we talked about how to reduce crime,
p53
aVwere a series of officers with a lot of little yellow sticky notes.
p54
aVAnd they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it
p55
aVand they would put it up on a board.
p56
aVAnd one of them said,  "We had a robbery two weeks ago.
p57
aVWe have no suspects."
p58
aVAnd another said, "We had a shooting in this neighborhood last week. We have no suspects."
p59
aVWe weren't using data-driven policing.
p60
aVWe were essentially trying to fight crime
p61
aVwith yellow Post-it notes.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, both of these things made me realize
p64
aVfundamentally that we were failing.
p65
aVWe didn't even know who was in our criminal justice system,
p66
aVwe didn't have any data about the things that mattered,
p67
aVand we didn't share data or use analytics
p68
aVor tools to help us make better decisions
p69
aVand to reduce crime.
p70
aVAnd for the first time, I started to think
p71
aVabout how we made decisions.
p72
aVWhen I was an assistant D.A.,
p73
aVand when I was a federal prosecutor,
p74
aVI looked at the cases in front of me,
p75
aVand I generally made decisions based on my instinct
p76
aVand my experience.
p77
aVWhen I became attorney general,
p78
aVI could look at the system as a whole,
p79
aVand what surprised me is that I found
p80
aVthat that was exactly how we were doing it
p81
aVacross the entire system \u2014
p82
aVin police departments, in prosecutors's offices,
p83
aVin courts and in jails.
p84
aVAnd what I learned very quickly
p85
aVis that we weren't doing a good job.
p86
aVSo I wanted to do things differently.
p87
aVI wanted to introduce data and analytics
p88
aVand rigorous statistical analysis
p89
aVinto our work.
p90
aVIn short, I wanted to moneyball criminal justice.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow, moneyball, as many of you know,
p93
aVis what the Oakland A's did,
p94
aVwhere they used smart data and statistics
p95
aVto figure out how to pick players
p96
aVthat would help them win games,
p97
aVand they went from a system that  was based on baseball scouts
p98
aVwho used to go out and watch players
p99
aVand use their instinct and experience,
p100
aVthe scouts' instincts and experience,
p101
aVto pick players, from one to use
p102
aVsmart data and rigorous statistical analysis
p103
aVto figure out how to pick players that would help them win games.
p104
aa(lp105
VIt worked for the Oakland A's,
p106
aVand it worked in the state of New Jersey.
p107
aVWe took Camden off the top of the list
p108
aVas the most dangerous city in America.
p109
aVWe reduced murders there by 41 percent,
p110
aVwhich actually means 37 lives were saved.
p111
aVAnd we reduced all crime in the city by 26 percent.
p112
aVWe also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions.
p113
aVSo we went from doing low-level drug crimes
p114
aVthat were outside our building
p115
aVto doing cases of statewide importance,
p116
aVon things like reducing violence with the most violent offenders,
p117
aVprosecuting street gangs,
p118
aVgun and drug trafficking, and political corruption.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd all of this matters greatly,
p121
aVbecause public safety to me
p122
aVis the most important function of government.
p123
aVIf we're not safe, we can't be educated,
p124
aVwe can't be healthy,
p125
aVwe can't do any of the other things we want to do in our lives.
p126
aVAnd we live in a country today
p127
aVwhere we face serious criminal justice problems.
p128
aVWe have 12 million arrests every single year.
p129
aVThe vast majority of those arrests
p130
aVare for low-level crimes, like misdemeanors,
p131
aV70 to 80 percent.
p132
aVLess than five percent of all arrests
p133
aVare for violent crime.
p134
aVYet we spend 75 billion,
p135
aVthat's b for billion,
p136
aVdollars a year on state and local corrections costs.
p137
aVRight now, today, we have 2.3 million people
p138
aVin our jails and prisons.
p139
aVAnd we face unbelievable public safety challenges
p140
aVbecause we have a situation
p141
aVin which two thirds of the people in our jails
p142
aVare there waiting for trial.
p143
aVThey haven't yet been convicted of a crime.
p144
aVThey're just waiting for their day in court.
p145
aVAnd 67 percent of people come back.
p146
aVOur recidivism rate is amongst  the highest in the world.
p147
aVAlmost seven in 10 people who are released
p148
aVfrom prison will be rearrested
p149
aVin a constant cycle of crime and incarceration.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo when I started my job at the Arnold Foundation,
p152
aVI came back to looking at a lot of these questions,
p153
aVand I came back to thinking about how
p154
aVwe had used data and analytics to transform
p155
aVthe way we did criminal justice in New Jersey.
p156
aVAnd when I look at the criminal justice system
p157
aVin the United States today,
p158
aVI feel the exact same way that I did
p159
aVabout the state of New Jersey when I started there,
p160
aVwhich is that we absolutely have to do better,
p161
aVand I know that we can do better.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo I decided to focus
p164
aVon using data and analytics
p165
aVto help make the most critical decision
p166
aVin public safety,
p167
aVand that decision is the determination
p168
aVof whether, when someone has been arrested,
p169
aVwhether they pose a risk to public safety
p170
aVand should be detained,
p171
aVor whether they don't pose a risk to public safety
p172
aVand should be released.
p173
aVEverything that happens in criminal cases
p174
aVcomes out of this one decision.
p175
aVIt impacts everything.
p176
aVIt impacts sentencing.
p177
aVIt impacts whether someone gets drug treatment.
p178
aVIt impacts crime and violence.
p179
aVAnd when I talk to judges around the United States,
p180
aVwhich I do all the time now,
p181
aVthey all say the same thing,
p182
aVwhich is that we put dangerous people in jail,
p183
aVand we let non-dangerous, nonviolent people out.
p184
aVThey mean it and they believe it.
p185
aVBut when you start to look at the data,
p186
aVwhich, by the way, the judges don't have,
p187
aVwhen we start to look at the data,
p188
aVwhat we find time and time again,
p189
aVis that this isn't the case.
p190
aVWe find low-risk offenders,
p191
aVwhich makes up 50 percent of our entire criminal justice population,
p192
aVwe find that they're in jail.
p193
aVTake Leslie Chew, who was a Texas man
p194
aVwho stole four blankets on a cold winter night.
p195
aVHe was arrested, and he was kept in jail
p196
aVon 3,500 dollars bail,
p197
aVan amount that he could not afford to pay.
p198
aVAnd he stayed in jail for eight months
p199
aVuntil his case came up for trial,
p200
aVat a cost to taxpayers of more than 9,000 dollars.
p201
aVAnd at the other end of the spectrum,
p202
aVwe're doing an equally terrible job.
p203
aVThe people who we find
p204
aVare the highest-risk offenders,
p205
aVthe people who we think have the highest likelihood
p206
aVof committing a new crime if they're released,
p207
aVwe see nationally that 50 percent of those people
p208
aVare being released.
p209
aa(lp210
VThe reason for this is the way we make decisions.
p211
aVJudges have the best intentions
p212
aVwhen they make these decisions about risk,
p213
aVbut they're making them subjectively.
p214
aVThey're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago
p215
aVwho were using their instinct and their experience
p216
aVto try to decide what risk someone poses.
p217
aVThey're being subjective,
p218
aVand we know what happens with subjective decision making,
p219
aVwhich is that we are often wrong.
p220
aVWhat we need in this space
p221
aVare strong data and analytics.
p222
aa(lp223
VWhat I decided to look for
p224
aVwas a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool,
p225
aVsomething that would let judges actually understand
p226
aVwith a scientific and objective way
p227
aVwhat the risk was that was posed
p228
aVby someone in front of them.
p229
aVI looked all over the country,
p230
aVand I found that between five and 10 percent
p231
aVof all U.S. jurisdictions
p232
aVactually use any type of risk assessment tool,
p233
aVand when I looked at these tools,
p234
aVI quickly realized why.
p235
aVThey were unbelievably expensive to administer,
p236
aVthey were time-consuming,
p237
aVthey were limited to the local jurisdiction
p238
aVin which they'd been created.
p239
aVSo basically, they couldn't be scaled
p240
aVor transferred to other places.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo I went out and built a phenomenal team
p243
aVof data scientists and researchers
p244
aVand statisticians
p245
aVto build a universal risk assessment tool,
p246
aVso that every single judge in the United States of America
p247
aVcan have an objective, scientific measure of risk.
p248
aVIn the tool that we've built,
p249
aVwhat we did was we collected 1.5 million cases
p250
aVfrom all around the United States,
p251
aVfrom cities, from counties,
p252
aVfrom every single state in the country,
p253
aVthe federal districts.
p254
aVAnd with those 1.5 million cases,
p255
aVwhich is the largest data set on pretrial
p256
aVin the United States today,
p257
aVwe were able to basically find that there were
p258
aV900-plus risk factors that we could look at
p259
aVto try to figure out what mattered most.
p260
aVAnd we found that there were nine specific things
p261
aVthat mattered all across the country
p262
aVand that were the most highly predictive of risk.
p263
aVAnd so we built a universal risk assessment tool.
p264
aVAnd it looks like this.
p265
aVAs you'll see, we put some information in,
p266
aVbut most of it is incredibly simple,
p267
aVit's easy to use,
p268
aVit focuses on things like the defendant's prior convictions,
p269
aVwhether they've been sentenced to incarceration,
p270
aVwhether they've engaged in violence before,
p271
aVwhether they've even failed to come back to court.
p272
aVAnd with this tool, we can predict three things.
p273
aVFirst, whether or not someone will commit
p274
aVa new crime if they're released.
p275
aVSecond, for the first time,
p276
aVand I think this is incredibly important,
p277
aVwe can predict whether someone will commit
p278
aVan act of violence if they're released.
p279
aVAnd that's the single most important thing
p280
aVthat judges say when you talk to them.
p281
aVAnd third, we can predict whether someone
p282
aVwill come back to court.
p283
aVAnd every single judge in the United States of America can use it,
p284
aVbecause it's been created on a universal data set.
p285
aa(lp286
VWhat judges see if they run the risk assessment tool
p287
aVis this \u2014 it's a dashboard.
p288
aVAt the top, you see the New Criminal Activity Score,
p289
aVsix of course being the highest,
p290
aVand then in the middle you see, "Elevated risk of violence."
p291
aVWhat that says is that this person
p292
aVis someone who has an elevated risk of violence
p293
aVthat the judge should look twice at.
p294
aVAnd then, towards the bottom,
p295
aVyou see the Failure to Appear Score,
p296
aVwhich again is the likelihood
p297
aVthat someone will come back to court.
p298
aa(lp299
VNow I want to say something really important.
p300
aVIt's not that I think we should be eliminating
p301
aVthe judge's instinct and experience
p302
aVfrom this process.
p303
aVI don't.
p304
aVI actually believe the problem that we see
p305
aVand the reason that we have these incredible system errors,
p306
aVwhere we're incarcerating low-level, nonviolent people
p307
aVand we're releasing high-risk, dangerous people,
p308
aVis that we don't have an objective measure of risk.
p309
aVBut what I believe should happen
p310
aVis that we should take that data-driven risk assessment
p311
aVand combine that with the judge's instinct and experience
p312
aVto lead us to better decision making.
p313
aVThe tool went statewide in Kentucky on July 1,
p314
aVand we're about to go up in a number of other U.S. jurisdictions.
p315
aVOur goal, quite simply, is that every single judge
p316
aVin the United States will use a data-driven risk tool
p317
aVwithin the next five years.
p318
aVWe're now working on risk tools
p319
aVfor prosecutors and for police officers as well,
p320
aVto try to take a system that runs today
p321
aVin America the same way it did 50 years ago,
p322
aVbased on instinct and experience,
p323
aVand make it into one that runs
p324
aVon data and analytics.
p325
aa(lp326
VNow, the great news about all this,
p327
aVand we have a ton of work left to do,
p328
aVand we have a lot of culture to change,
p329
aVbut the great news about all of it
p330
aVis that we know it works.
p331
aVIt's why Google is Google,
p332
aVand it's why all these baseball teams use moneyball
p333
aVto win games.
p334
aVThe great news for us as well
p335
aVis that it's the way that we can transform
p336
aVthe American criminal justice system.
p337
aVIt's how we can make our streets safer,
p338
aVwe can reduce our prison costs,
p339
aVand we can make our system much fairer
p340
aVand more just.
p341
aVSome people call it data science.
p342
aVI call it moneyballing criminal justice.
p343
aa(lp344
VThank you.

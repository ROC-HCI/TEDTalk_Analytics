VHello, my name is Thomas Heatherwick.
p5
aVI have a studio in London
p6
aVthat has a particular approach
p7
aVto designing buildings.
p8
aVWhen I was growing up,
p9
aVI was exposed to making
p10
aVand crafts and materials
p11
aVand invention on a small scale.
p12
aVAnd I was there looking
p13
aVat the larger scale of buildings
p14
aVand finding
p15
aVthat the buildings that were around me
p16
aVand that were being designed
p17
aVand that were there in the publications I was seeing
p18
aVfelt soulless and cold.
p19
aVAnd there on the smaller scale,
p20
aVthe scale of an earring
p21
aVor a ceramic pot
p22
aVor a musical instrument,
p23
aVwas a materiality and a soulfulness.
p24
aVAnd this influenced me.
p25
aVThe first building I built was 20 years ago.
p26
aVAnd since, in the last 20 years,
p27
aVI've developed a studio in London.
p28
aVSorry, this was my mother, by the way,
p29
aVin her bead shop in London.
p30
aVI spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that.
p31
aa(lp32
VI'm just going to show, for people who don't know my studio's work,
p33
aVa few projects that we've worked on.
p34
aVThis is a hospital building.
p35
aVThis is a shop for a bag company.
p36
aVThis is studios for artists.
p37
aVThis is a sculpture
p38
aVmade from a million yards of wire
p39
aVand 150,000 glass beads
p40
aVthe size of a golf ball.
p41
aVAnd this is a window display.
p42
aVAnd this is pair of cooling towers
p43
aVfor an electricity substation
p44
aVnext to St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
p45
aVAnd this is a temple in Japan
p46
aVfor a Buddhist monk.
p47
aVAnd this is a cafe by the sea
p48
aVin Britain.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd just very quickly,
p51
aVsomething we've been working on very recently
p52
aVis we were commissioned by the mayor of London
p53
aVto design a new bus
p54
aVthat gave the passenger
p55
aVtheir freedom again.
p56
aVBecause the original Routemaster bus
p57
aVthat some of you may be familiar with,
p58
aVwhich had this open platform at the back \u2014
p59
aVin fact, I think all our Routemasters
p60
aVare here in California now actually.
p61
aVBut they aren't in London.
p62
aVAnd so you're stuck on a bus.
p63
aVAnd if the bus is going to stop
p64
aVand it's three yards away from the bus stop,
p65
aVyou're just a prisoner.
p66
aVBut the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce
p67
aVbuses with this open platform.
p68
aVSo we've been working with Transport for London,
p69
aVand that organization
p70
aVhasn't actually been responsible
p71
aVas a client for a new bus
p72
aVfor 50 years.
p73
aVAnd so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work.
p74
aVThe brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy.
p75
aVSo it's got hybrid drive.
p76
aVAnd we've been working
p77
aVto try to improve
p78
aVeverything from the fabric
p79
aVto the format
p80
aVand structure
p81
aVand aesthetics.
p82
aa(lp83
VI was going to show four main projects.
p84
aVAnd this is a project for a bridge.
p85
aVAnd so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open.
p86
aVAnd openings seemed \u2014
p87
aVeveryone loves opening bridges,
p88
aVbut it's quite a basic thing.
p89
aVI think we all kind of stand and watch.
p90
aVBut the bridges that we saw
p91
aVthat opened and closed \u2014
p92
aVI'm slightly squeamish \u2014
p93
aVbut I once saw a photograph of a footballer
p94
aVwho was diving for a ball.
p95
aVAnd as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee,
p96
aVand it had broken like this.
p97
aVAnd then we looked at these kinds of bridges
p98
aVand just couldn't help feeling
p99
aVthat it was a beautiful thing that had broken.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd so this is in Paddington in London.
p102
aVAnd it's a very boring bridge, as you can see.
p103
aVIt's just steel and timber.
p104
aVBut instead of what it is,
p105
aVour focus was on the way it worked.
p106
aV(Applause)
p107
aVSo we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it
p108
aVwould end up kissing each other.
p109
aV(Applause)
p110
aVWe actually had to halve its speed,
p111
aVbecause everyone was too scared when we first did it.
p112
aVSo that's it speeded up.
p113
aa(lp114
VA project that we've been working on very recently
p115
aVis to design a new biomass power station \u2014
p116
aVso a power station that uses organic waste material.
p117
aVIn the news,
p118
aVthe subject of where our future water is going to come from
p119
aVand where our power is going to come from
p120
aVis in all the papers all the time.
p121
aVAnd we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power.
p122
aVBut recently,
p123
aVany annual report of a power company
p124
aVdoesn't have a power station on it.
p125
aVIt has a child running through a field, or something like that.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd so when a consortium of engineers approached us
p130
aVand asked us to work with them on this power station,
p131
aVour condition was that we would work with them
p132
aVand that, whatever we did,
p133
aVwe were not just going to decorate a normal power station.
p134
aVAnd instead, we had to learn \u2014 we kind of forced them to teach us.
p135
aVAnd so we spent time traveling with them
p136
aVand learning about all the different elements,
p137
aVand finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies
p138
aVthat weren't being capitalized on.
p139
aVThat just taking a field and banging all these things out
p140
aVisn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo we looked at how we could compose all those elements \u2014
p143
aVinstead of just litter, create one composition.
p144
aVAnd what we found \u2014
p145
aVthis area is one of the poorest parts of Britain.
p146
aVIt was voted the worst place in Britain to live.
p147
aVAnd there are 2,000 new homes being built
p148
aVnext to this power station.
p149
aVSo it felt this has a social dimension.
p150
aVIt has a symbolic importance.
p151
aVAnd we should be proud of where our power is coming from,
p152
aVrather than something we are necessarily ashamed of.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo we were looking at how we could make a power station,
p155
aVthat, instead of keeping people out
p156
aVand having a big fence around the outside,
p157
aVcould be a place that pulls you in.
p158
aVAnd it has to be \u2014
p159
aVI'm trying to get my \u2014
p160
aV250 feet high.
p161
aVSo it felt that what we could try to do
p162
aVis make a power park
p163
aVand actually bring the whole area in,
p164
aVand using the spare soil that's there on the site,
p165
aVwe could make a power station that was silent as well.
p166
aVBecause just that soil
p167
aVcould make the acoustic difference.
p168
aVAnd we also found that we could make a more efficient structure
p169
aVand have a cost-effective way
p170
aVof making a structure to do this.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe finished project
p173
aVis meant to be more than just a power station.
p174
aVIt has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVAnd it's a power park.
p177
aVSo people can come and really experience this
p178
aVand also look out all around the area,
p179
aVand use that height that we have to have for its function.
p180
aa(lp181
VIn Shanghai,
p182
aVwe were invited to build \u2014
p183
aVwell we weren't invited; what am I talking about.
p184
aVWe won the competition, and it was painful to get there.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVSo we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion.
p187
aVAnd an expo
p188
aVis a totally bonkers thing.
p189
aVThere's 250 pavilions.
p190
aVIt's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened.
p191
aVSo there are up to a million people there everyday.
p192
aVAnd 250 countries all competing.
p193
aVAnd the British government saying,
p194
aV"You need to be in the top five."
p195
aVAnd so that became
p196
aVthe governmental goal \u2014
p197
aVis, how do you stand out in this chaos,
p198
aVwhich is an expo of stimulus?
p199
aVSo our sense was we had to do one thing,
p200
aVand only one thing,
p201
aVinstead of trying to have everything.
p202
aVAnd so what we also felt
p203
aVwas that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VBut the thing that was true,
p208
aVthe expo was about the future of cities,
p209
aVand particularly the Victorians
p210
aVpioneered integrating nature into the cities.
p211
aVAnd the world's first public park of modern times
p212
aVwas in Britain.
p213
aVAnd the world's first major botanical institution
p214
aVis in London,
p215
aVand they have this extraordinary project
p216
aVwhere they've been collecting 25 percent
p217
aVof all the world's plant species.
p218
aVSo we suddenly realized that there was this thing.
p219
aVAnd everyone agrees that trees are beautiful,
p220
aVand I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like trees."
p221
aVAnd the same with flowers.
p222
aVI've never met anyone who says, "I don't like flowers."
p223
aVBut we realized that seeds \u2014
p224
aVthere's been this very serious project happening \u2014
p225
aVbut that seeds \u2014
p226
aVat these major botanical gardens,
p227
aVseeds aren't on show.
p228
aVBut you just have to go to a garden center,
p229
aVand they're in little paper packets.
p230
aVBut this phenomenal project's been happening.
p231
aVSo we realized we had to make a project
p232
aVthat would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut how could we show these teeny-weeny things?
p235
aVAnd the film "Jurassic Park" actually really helped us.
p236
aVBecause the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber
p237
aVgave us some kind of clue
p238
aVthat these tiny things
p239
aVcould be trapped and be made to seem precious,
p240
aVrather than looking like nuts.
p241
aVSo the challenge was,
p242
aVhow are we going to bring light and expose these things?
p243
aVWe didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content.
p244
aVSo we were trying to think,
p245
aVhow could we make a whole thing emanate.
p246
aVBy the way, we had half the budget of the other Western nations.
p247
aVSo that was also in the mix
p248
aVwith the site the size of a football pitch.
p249
aVAnd so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Video) Voice Over: The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop.
p252
aVSong: \u266b We've got the Mop Tops, the Play-Doh Mop Tops \u266b
p253
aV\u266b Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair \u266b
p254
aV\u266b They're the Mop Tops \u266b
p255
aa(lp256
VThomas Heatherwick: Okay, you get the idea.
p257
aVSo the idea
p258
aVwas to take these 66,000 seeds
p259
aVthat they agreed to give us,
p260
aVand to take each seed and trap it
p261
aVin this precious optical hair
p262
aVand grow that through this box,
p263
aVvery simple box element,
p264
aVand make it a building
p265
aVthat could move in the wind.
p266
aVSo the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows.
p267
aVAnd inside, the daylight \u2014
p268
aVeach one is an optic
p269
aVand it brings light into the center.
p270
aVAnd by night,
p271
aVartificial light in each one
p272
aVemanates and comes out to the outside.
p273
aVAnd to make the project affordable,
p274
aVwe focused our energy.
p275
aVInstead of building a building as big as the football pitch,
p276
aVwe focused it on this one element.
p277
aVAnd the government agreed to do that
p278
aVand not do anything else,
p279
aVand focus our energy on that.
p280
aVAnd so the rest of the site was a public space.
p281
aVAnd with a million people there a day,
p282
aVit just felt like offering some public space.
p283
aa(lp284
VWe worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer
p285
aVto develop a mini-me version
p286
aVof the seed cathedral,
p287
aVso that, even if you're partially-sighted,
p288
aVthat it was kind of crunchy and soft,
p289
aVthat piece of landscape that you see there.
p290
aVAnd then, you know when a pet has an operation
p291
aVand they shave a bit of the skin
p292
aVand get rid of the fur \u2014
p293
aVin order to get you to go into the seed cathedral,
p294
aVin effect, we've shaved it.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd inside there's nothing;
p297
aVthere's no famous actor's voice;
p298
aVthere's no projections;
p299
aVthere's no televisions; there's no color changing.
p300
aVThere's just silence
p301
aVand a cool temperature.
p302
aVAnd if a cloud goes past,
p303
aVyou can see a cloud on the tips
p304
aVwhere it's letting the light through.
p305
aVThis is the only project that we've done
p306
aVwhere the finished thing
p307
aVlooked more like a rendering than our renderings.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VA key thing was how people would interact.
p312
aVI mean, in a way it was the most serious thing
p313
aVyou could possible do at the expo.
p314
aVAnd I just wanted to show you.
p315
aVThe British government \u2014
p316
aVany government is potentially the worst client in the world
p317
aVyou could ever possibly want to have.
p318
aVAnd there was a lot of terror.
p319
aVBut there was an underlying support.
p320
aVAnd so there was a moment
p321
aVwhen suddenly \u2014 actually, the next thing.
p322
aVThis is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment,
p323
aVwho was our client,
p324
aVwith the Chinese children, using the landscape.
p325
aa(lp326
V(Video) Children: One, two, three, go.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VTH: I'm sorry about my stupid voice there.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VSo finally, texture is something.
p335
aVIn the projects we've been working on,
p336
aVthese slick buildings,
p337
aVwhere they might be a fancy shape,
p338
aVbut the materiality feels the same,
p339
aVis something that we've been trying to research really,
p340
aVand explore alternatives.
p341
aVAnd the project that we're building in Malaysia
p342
aVis apartment buildings
p343
aVfor a property developer.
p344
aVAnd it's in a piece of land
p345
aVthat's this site.
p346
aVAnd the mayor of Kuala Lumpur
p347
aVsaid that, if this developer
p348
aVwould give something that gave something back to the city,
p349
aVthey would give them more gross floor area, buildable.
p350
aVSo there was an incentive for the developer
p351
aVto really try to think about
p352
aVwhat would be better for the city.
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd the conventional thing with apartment buildings
p355
aVin this part of the world
p356
aVis you have your tower,
p357
aVand you squeeze a few trees around the edge,
p358
aVand you see cars parked.
p359
aVIt's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience,
p360
aVand the rest of it is just for postcards.
p361
aVThe lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this.
p362
aVSo if we could chop that away
p363
aVand give the building a small bottom,
p364
aVwe could take that bit and put it at the top
p365
aVwhere the greater commercial value is for a property developer.
p366
aVAnd by linking these together,
p367
aVwe could have 90 percent of the site
p368
aVas a rainforest,
p369
aVinstead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees
p370
aVand bits of road around buildings.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Applause)
p373
aa(lp374
VSo we're building these buildings.
p375
aVThey're actually identical, so it's quite cost-effective.
p376
aVThey're just chopped at different heights.
p377
aVBut the key part
p378
aVis trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape,
p379
aVrather than engulf it.
p380
aVAnd that's my final slide.
p381
aa(lp382
VThank you.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Applause)
p385
aa(lp386
VThank you.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Applause)
p389
aa(lp390
VJune Cohen: So thank you. Thank you, Thomas. You're a delight.
p391
aVSince we have an extra minute here,
p392
aVI thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds,
p393
aVwhich maybe came from the shaved bit of the building.
p394
aa(lp395
VTH: These are a few of the tests we did
p396
aVwhen we were building the structure.
p397
aVSo there were 66,000 of these.
p398
aVThis optic
p399
aVwas 22 feet long.
p400
aVAnd so the daylight was just coming \u2014
p401
aVit was caught on the outside of the box
p402
aVand was coming down to illuminate each seed.
p403
aVWaterproofing the building was a bit crazy.
p404
aVBecause it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway,
p405
aVbut if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it \u2014
p406
aVwe had quite a time.
p407
aVThere was one person in the contractors who was the right size \u2014
p408
aVand it wasn't a child \u2014
p409
aVwho could fit between them
p410
aVfor the final waterproofing of the building.
p411
aa(lp412
VJC: Thank you, Thomas.
p413
aa(lp414

aa(lp8
VSo, I didn't always make my living from music.
p9
aVFor about the five years after graduating
p10
aVfrom an upstanding liberal arts university,
p11
aVthis was my day job.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VI was a self-employed living statue called the Eight-Foot Bride,
p16
aVand I love telling people I did this for a job,
p17
aVbecause everybody always wants to know,
p18
aVwho are these freaks in real life.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VHello.
p23
aa(lp24
VI painted myself white one day, stood on a box,
p25
aVput a hat or a can at my feet,
p26
aVand when someone came by and dropped in money,
p27
aVI handed them a flower \u2014
p28
aVand some intense eye contact.
p29
aVAnd if they didn't take the flower,
p30
aVI threw in a gesture of sadness and longing \u2014
p31
aVas they walked away.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VSo I had the most profound encounters with people,
p36
aVespecially lonely people
p37
aVwho looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks,
p38
aVand we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact
p39
aVbeing allowed in a city street,
p40
aVand we would sort of fall in love a little bit.
p41
aVAnd my eyes would say \u2014
p42
aV"Thank you.
p43
aVI see you."
p44
aVAnd their eyes would say \u2014
p45
aV"Nobody ever sees me.
p46
aVThank you."
p47
aa(lp48
VI would get harassed sometimes.
p49
aVPeople would yell at me from their cars.
p50
aV"Get a job!"
p51
aV(Laughing) And I'd be, like,
p52
aV"This is my job."
p53
aVBut it hurt, because it made me fear
p54
aVthat I was somehow doing something un-joblike
p55
aVand unfair, shameful.
p56
aVI had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting
p57
aVfor the music business on this box.
p58
aVAnd for the economists out there,
p59
aVyou may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income,
p60
aVwhich was shocking to me, given I had no regular customers,
p61
aVbut pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday, 90 bucks on a Friday.
p62
aVIt was consistent.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd meanwhile, I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs
p65
aVwith my band, the Dresden Dolls.
p66
aVThis was me on piano, a genius drummer.
p67
aVI wrote the songs, and eventually
p68
aVwe started making enough money that I could quit being a statue,
p69
aVand as we started touring,
p70
aVI really didn't want to lose this sense
p71
aVof direct connection with people, because I loved it.
p72
aVSo after all of our shows, we would sign autographs
p73
aVand hug fans and hang out and talk to people,
p74
aVand we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us,
p75
aVand I would track down local musicians and artists
p76
aVand they would set up outside of our shows,
p77
aVand they would pass the hat,
p78
aVand then they would come in and join us onstage,
p79
aVso we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd then Twitter came along,
p82
aVand made things even more magic,
p83
aVbecause I could ask instantly for anything anywhere.
p84
aVSo I would need a piano to practice on,
p85
aVand an hour later I would be at a fan's house.
p86
aVThis is in London.
p87
aVPeople would bring home-cooked food to us
p88
aVall over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us.
p89
aVThis is in Seattle.
p90
aVFans who worked in museums and stores
p91
aVand any kind of public space would wave their hands
p92
aVif I would decide to do a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.
p93
aVThis is a library in Auckland.
p94
aVOn Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat,
p95
aVbecause I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast,
p96
aVand they showed up care of this dude, Chris, from Newport Beach,
p97
aVwho says hello.
p98
aVI once tweeted, "Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot?"
p99
aVAnd a nurse from a hospital drove one
p100
aVright at that moment to the cafe I was in,
p101
aVand I bought her a smoothie
p102
aVand we sat there talking about nursing and death.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd I love this kind of random closeness,
p105
aVwhich is lucky, because I do a lot of couchsurfing.
p106
aVIn mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room
p107
aVbut there's no wireless,
p108
aVand in punk squats,
p109
aVeveryone on the floor in one room with no toilets
p110
aVbut with wireless, clearly making it the better option.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VMy crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood
p115
aVand we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night
p116
aVwas an 18-year-old girl, still living at home,
p117
aVand her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras.
p118
aVAnd that night, her whole family
p119
aVtook the couches and she slept together with her mom
p120
aVso that we could take their beds.
p121
aVAnd I lay there thinking,
p122
aVthese people have so little.
p123
aVIs this fair?
p124
aVAnd in the morning,
p125
aVher mom taught us how to try to make tortillas
p126
aVand wanted to give me a Bible,
p127
aVand she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English,
p128
aV"Your music has helped my daughter so much.
p129
aVThank you for staying here. We're all so grateful."
p130
aVAnd I thought, this is fair.
p131
aVThis is this.
p132
aa(lp133
VA couple of months later, I was in Manhattan,
p134
aVand I tweeted for a crash pad, and at midnight,
p135
aVI'm on the Lower East Side,
p136
aVand it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone.
p137
aVI've always been with my band or my crew.
p138
aVIs this what stupid people do?
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VIs this how stupid people die?
p143
aVAnd before I can change my mind, the door busts open.
p144
aVShe's an artist.
p145
aVHe's a financial blogger for Reuters,
p146
aVand they're pouring me a glass of red wine
p147
aVand offering me a bath,
p148
aVand I have had thousands of nights like that and like that.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot.
p151
aVI maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing
p152
aVare basically the same thing.
p153
aVYou're falling into the audience
p154
aVand you're trusting each other.
p155
aVI once asked an opening band of mine
p156
aVif they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat
p157
aVto get some extra money, something that I did a lot.
p158
aVAnd as usual, the band was psyched,
p159
aVbut there was this one guy in the band
p160
aVwho told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there.
p161
aVIt felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat.
p162
aVAnd I recognized his fear
p163
aVof "Is this fair?"
p164
aVand "Get a job."
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd meanwhile, my band is becoming bigger and bigger.
p167
aVWe sign with a major label.
p168
aVAnd our music is a cross between punk and cabaret.
p169
aVIt's not for everybody.
p170
aVWell, maybe it's for you.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VWe sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record.
p175
aVAnd it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies
p176
aVin the first few weeks,
p177
aVand the label considers this a failure.
p178
aa(lp179
VI was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"
p180
aa(lp181
VThey said, "No, the sales are going down.
p182
aVIt's a failure."
p183
aVAnd they walk off.
p184
aa(lp185
VRight at this same time, I'm signing and hugging after a gig,
p186
aVand a guy comes up to me
p187
aVand hands me a $10 bill,
p188
aVand he says,
p189
aV"I'm sorry, I burned your CD from a friend."
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
V"But I read your blog, I know you hate your label.
p194
aVI just want you to have this money."
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd this starts happening all the time.
p197
aVI become the hat after my own gigs,
p198
aVbut I have to physically stand there and take the help from people,
p199
aVand unlike the guy in the opening band,
p200
aVI've actually had a lot of practice standing there.
p201
aVThank you.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd this is the moment I decide
p204
aVI'm just going to give away my music for free
p205
aVonline whenever possible,
p206
aVso it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad;
p207
aVAmanda Palmer over here,
p208
aVand I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing,
p209
aVbut I'm going to ask for help,
p210
aVbecause I saw it work on the street.
p211
aVSo I fought my way off my label, and for my next project
p212
aVwith my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra,
p213
aVI turned to crowdfunding.
p214
aVAnd I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made,
p215
aVand I asked my crowd to catch me.
p216
aVAnd the goal was 100,000 dollars.
p217
aVMy fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,
p218
aVwhich was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd you can see how many people it is.
p223
aVIt's about 25,000 people.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd the media asked,
p226
aV"Amanda, the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy.
p227
aVHow did you make all these people pay for music?"
p228
aVAnd the real answer is, I didn't make them.
p229
aVI asked them.
p230
aVAnd through the very act of asking people,
p231
aVI'd connected with them,
p232
aVand when you connect with them, people want to help you.
p233
aVIt's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists.
p234
aVThey don't want to ask for things.
p235
aVBut it's not easy.
p236
aVIt's not easy to ask.
p237
aVAnd a lot of artists have a problem with this.
p238
aVAsking makes you vulnerable.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd I got a lot of criticism online,
p241
aVafter my Kickstarter went big,
p242
aVfor continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices,
p243
aVspecifically for asking musicians
p244
aVwho are fans if they wanted to join us on stage
p245
aVfor a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer,
p246
aVand this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website.
p247
aVAnd this hurt in a really familiar way.
p248
aVAnd people saying,
p249
aV"You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help,"
p250
aVreally reminded me of the people in their cars yelling, "Get a job."
p251
aVBecause they weren't with us on the sidewalk,
p252
aVand they couldn't see the exchange
p253
aVthat was happening between me and my crowd,
p254
aVan exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo this is slightly not safe for work.
p257
aVThis is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin.
p258
aVAt the end of the night, I stripped and let everyone draw on me.
p259
aVNow let me tell you, if you want to experience
p260
aVthe visceral feeling of trusting strangers \u2014
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VI recommend this,
p265
aVespecially if those strangers are drunk German people.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VThis was a ninja master-level fan connection,
p270
aVbecause what I was really saying here was,
p271
aVI trust you this much.
p272
aVShould I?
p273
aVShow me.
p274
aa(lp275
VFor most of human history,
p276
aVmusicians, artists, they've been part of the community.
p277
aVConnectors and openers, not untouchable stars.
p278
aVCelebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance,
p279
aVbut the Internet
p280
aVand the content that we're freely able to share on it
p281
aVare taking us back.
p282
aVIt's about a few people loving you up close
p283
aVand about those people being enough.
p284
aVSo a lot of people are confused by the idea
p285
aVof no hard sticker price.
p286
aVThey see it as an unpredictable risk, but the things I've done,
p287
aVthe Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,
p288
aVI don't see these things as risk.
p289
aVI see them as trust.
p290
aVNow, the online tools
p291
aVto make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street,
p292
aVthey're getting there.
p293
aVBut the perfect tools aren't going to help us
p294
aVif we can't face each other
p295
aVand give and receive fearlessly,
p296
aVbut, more important \u2014
p297
aVto ask without shame.
p298
aa(lp299
VMy music career has been spent
p300
aVtrying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box.
p301
aVSo blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates
p302
aVand my new video but about our work and our art
p303
aVand our fears and our hangovers,
p304
aVour mistakes,
p305
aVand we see each other.
p306
aVAnd I think when we really see each other,
p307
aVwe want to help each other.
p308
aa(lp309
VI think people have been obsessed with the wrong question,
p310
aVwhich is, "How do we make people pay for music?"
p311
aVWhat if we started asking,
p312
aV"How do we let people pay for music?"
p313
aa(lp314
VThank you.

VLet me talk about India
p5
aVthrough the evolution of ideas.
p6
aVNow I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it
p7
aVbecause in every society, especially an open democratic society,
p8
aVit's only when ideas take root that things change.
p9
aVSlowly ideas lead to ideology,
p10
aVlead to policies that lead to actions.
p11
aa(lp12
VIn 1930 this country went through a Great Depression,
p13
aVwhich led to all the ideas of the state and social security,
p14
aVand all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time.
p15
aVIn the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation.
p16
aVAnd today, after the global economic crisis,
p17
aVthere was a whole new set of rules
p18
aVabout how the state should intervene.
p19
aVSo ideas change states.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd I looked at India and said,
p22
aVreally there are four kinds of ideas
p23
aVwhich really make an impact on India.
p24
aVThe first, to my mind,
p25
aVis what I call as "the ideas that have arrived."
p26
aVThese ideas have brought together something
p27
aVwhich has made India happen the way it is today.
p28
aVThe second set of ideas I call "ideas in progress."
p29
aVThose are ideas which have been accepted
p30
aVbut not implemented yet.
p31
aVThe third set of ideas are what I call as
p32
aV"ideas that we argue about" \u2014
p33
aVthose are ideas where we have a fight,
p34
aVan ideological battle about how to do things.
p35
aVAnd the fourth thing, which I believe is most important, is
p36
aV"the ideas that we need to anticipate."
p37
aVBecause when you are a developing country
p38
aVin the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having,
p39
aVyou can actually anticipate
p40
aVwhat that did and do things very differently.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow in India's case I believe there are six ideas
p43
aVwhich are responsible for where it has come today.
p44
aVThe first is really the notion of people.
p45
aVIn the '60s and '70s
p46
aVwe thought of people as a burden.
p47
aVWe thought of people as a liability.
p48
aVToday we talk of people as an asset.
p49
aVWe talk of people as human capital.
p50
aVAnd I believe this change in the mindset,
p51
aVof looking at people as something of a burden
p52
aVto human capital,
p53
aVhas been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset.
p54
aVAnd this change in thinking of human capital
p55
aVis linked to the fact
p56
aVthat India is going through a demographic dividend.
p57
aVAs healthcare improves,
p58
aVas infant mortality goes down,
p59
aVfertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that.
p60
aVIndia is going to have
p61
aVa lot of young people with a demographic dividend
p62
aVfor the next 30 years.
p63
aVWhat is unique about this demographic dividend
p64
aVis that India will be the only country in the world
p65
aVto have this demographic dividend.
p66
aVIn other words, it will be the only young country in an aging world.
p67
aVAnd this is very important. At the same time
p68
aVif you peel away the demographic dividend in India,
p69
aVthere are actually two demographic curves.
p70
aVOne is in the south and in the west of India,
p71
aVwhich is already going to be fully expensed by 2015,
p72
aVbecause in that part of the country, the fertility rate is
p73
aValmost equal to that of a West European country.
p74
aVThen there is the whole northern India,
p75
aVwhich is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend.
p76
aVBut a demographic dividend is only as good
p77
aVas the investment in your human capital.
p78
aVOnly if the people have education,
p79
aVthey have good health, they have infrastructure,
p80
aVthey have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night \u2014
p81
aVonly in those cases can you really get the benefit
p82
aVof a demographic dividend.
p83
aVIn other words, if you don't really invest in the human capital,
p84
aVthe same demographic dividend
p85
aVcan be a demographic disaster.
p86
aVTherefore India is at a critical point
p87
aVwhere either it can leverage its demographic dividend
p88
aVor it can lead to a demographic disaster.
p89
aa(lp90
VThe second thing in India has been the change in
p91
aVthe role of entrepreneurs.
p92
aVWhen India got independence entrepreneurs were seen
p93
aVas a bad lot, as people who would exploit.
p94
aVBut today, after 60 years, because of the rise of entrepreneurship,
p95
aVentrepreneurs have become role models,
p96
aVand they are contributing hugely to the society.
p97
aVThis change has contributed
p98
aVto the vitality and the whole economy.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe third big thing I believe that has changed India
p101
aVis our attitude towards the English language.
p102
aVEnglish language was seen as a language of the imperialists.
p103
aVBut today, with globalization,
p104
aVwith outsourcing, English has become a language of aspiration.
p105
aVThis has made it something that everybody wants to learn.
p106
aVAnd the fact that we have English is now becoming
p107
aVa huge strategic asset.
p108
aa(lp109
VThe next thing is technology.
p110
aVForty years back, computers were seen
p111
aVas something which was forbidding, something which was intimidating,
p112
aVsomething that reduced jobs.
p113
aVToday we live in a country
p114
aVwhich sells eight million mobile phones a month,
p115
aVof which 90 percent of those mobile phones
p116
aVare prepaid phones
p117
aVbecause people don't have credit history.
p118
aVForty percent of those prepaid phones
p119
aVare recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge.
p120
aVThat is the scale at which
p121
aVtechnology has liberated and made it accessible.
p122
aVAnd therefore technology has gone
p123
aVfrom being seen as something forbidding
p124
aVand intimidating to something that is empowering.
p125
aVTwenty years back,
p126
aVwhen there was a report on bank computerization,
p127
aVthey didn't name the report as
p128
aVa report on computers,
p129
aVthey call them as "ledger posting machines."
p130
aVThey didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers.
p131
aVAnd when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computers
p132
aVthey called them "advanced ledger posting machines."
p133
aVSo we have come a long way from those days
p134
aVwhere the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment,
p135
aVand really has changed the way Indians think of technology.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd then I think the other point
p138
aVis that Indians today are far more
p139
aVcomfortable with globalization.
p140
aVAgain, after having lived for more than 200 years
p141
aVunder the East India Company and under imperial rule,
p142
aVIndians had a very natural reaction towards globalization
p143
aVbelieving it was a form of imperialism.
p144
aVBut today, as Indian companies go abroad,
p145
aVas Indians come and work all over the world,
p146
aVIndians have gained a lot more confidence
p147
aVand have realized that globalization is something they can participate in.
p148
aVAnd the fact that the demographics are in our favor,
p149
aVbecause we are the only young country in an aging world,
p150
aVmakes globalization all the more attractive to Indians.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd finally, India has had
p153
aVthe deepening of its democracy.
p154
aVWhen democracy came to India 60 years back
p155
aVit was an elite concept.
p156
aVIt was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy
p157
aVbecause they wanted to bring in the idea of
p158
aVuniversal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth.
p159
aVBut today democracy has become a bottom-up process
p160
aVwhere everybody has realized
p161
aVthe benefits of having a voice,
p162
aVthe benefits of being in an open society.
p163
aVAnd therefore democracy has become embedded.
p164
aa(lp165
VI believe these six factors \u2014
p166
aVthe rise of the notion of population as human capital,
p167
aVthe rise of Indian entrepreneurs,
p168
aVthe rise of English as a language of aspiration,
p169
aVtechnology as something empowering,
p170
aVglobalization as a positive factor,
p171
aVand the deepening of democracy \u2014 has contributed
p172
aVto why India is today growing
p173
aVat rates it has never seen before.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut having said that,
p176
aVthen we come to what I call as ideas in progress.
p177
aVThose are the ideas where there is no argument in a society,
p178
aVbut you are not able to implement those things.
p179
aVAnd really there are four things here.
p180
aVOne is the question of education.
p181
aVFor some reason, whatever reason \u2014 lack of money,
p182
aVlack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture \u2014
p183
aVprimary education was never given the focus it required.
p184
aVBut now I believe it's reached a point
p185
aVwhere it has become very important.
p186
aVUnfortunately the government schools don't function,
p187
aVso children are going to private schools today.
p188
aVEven in the slums of India
p189
aVmore than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.
p190
aVSo there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work.
p191
aVBut having said that, there is an enormous desire
p192
aVamong everybody, including the poor, to educate their children.
p193
aVSo I believe primary education is an idea
p194
aVwhich is arrived but not yet implemented.
p195
aa(lp196
VSimilarly, infrastructure \u2014
p197
aVfor a long time, infrastructure was not a priority.
p198
aVThose of you who have been to India have seen that.
p199
aVIt's certainly not like China.
p200
aVBut today I believe finally infrastructure is something
p201
aVwhich is agreed upon and which people want to implement.
p202
aVIt is reflected in the political statements.
p203
aV20 years back the political slogan was, "Roti, kapada, makaan,"
p204
aVwhich meant, "Food, clothing and shelter."
p205
aVAnd today's political slogan is, "Bijli, sadak, pani,"
p206
aVwhich means "Electricity, water and roads."
p207
aVAnd that is a change in the mindset
p208
aVwhere infrastructure is now accepted.
p209
aVSo I do believe this is an idea which has arrived,
p210
aVbut simply not implemented.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe third thing is again cities.
p213
aVIt's because Gandhi believed in villages
p214
aVand because the British ruled from the cities,
p215
aVtherefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.
p216
aVFor a long time we have neglected our cities.
p217
aVAnd that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see.
p218
aVBut today, finally, after economic reforms,
p219
aVand economic growth,
p220
aVI think the notion that cities are engines
p221
aVof economic growth,
p222
aVcities are engines of creativity,
p223
aVcities are engines of innovation,
p224
aVhave finally been accepted.
p225
aVAnd I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities.
p226
aVAgain, an idea which is arrived, but not yet implemented.
p227
aa(lp228
VThe final thing is the notion of India as a single market \u2014
p229
aVbecause when you didn't think of India as a market,
p230
aVyou didn't really bother about a single market, because it didn't really matter.
p231
aVAnd therefore you had a situation
p232
aVwhere every state had its own market for products.
p233
aVEvery province had its own market for agriculture.
p234
aVIncreasingly now the policies of
p235
aVtaxation and infrastructure and all that,
p236
aVare moving towards creating India as a single market.
p237
aVSo there is a form of internal globalization which is happening,
p238
aVwhich is as important as external globalization.
p239
aVThese four factors I believe \u2014
p240
aVthe ones of primary education,
p241
aVinfrastructure, urbanization, and single market \u2014
p242
aVin my view are ideas in India
p243
aVwhich have been accepted, but not implemented.
p244
aa(lp245
VThen we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict.
p246
aVThe ideas that we argue about.
p247
aVThese are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.
p248
aVWhat are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.
p249
aVBecause of the historical Indian background, in the caste system,
p250
aVand because of the fact that there have been many people
p251
aVwho have been left out in the cold,
p252
aVa lot of the politics is about how to make sure
p253
aVthat we'll address that.
p254
aVAnd it leads to reservations and other techniques.
p255
aVIt's also related to the way that we subsidize our people,
p256
aVand all the left and right arguments that we have.
p257
aVA lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology
p258
aVof caste and other things.
p259
aVThis policy is causing gridlock.
p260
aVThis is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.
p261
aa(lp262
VThe second one is the labor policies that we have,
p263
aVwhich make it so difficult for
p264
aVentrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies,
p265
aVthat 93 percent of Indian labor
p266
aVis in the unorganized sector.
p267
aVThey have no benefits: they don't have social security;
p268
aVthey don't have pension; they don't have healthcare; none of those things.
p269
aVThis needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people
p270
aVinto the formal workforce,
p271
aVyou will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.
p272
aVTherefore we need to create a new set of labor laws,
p273
aVwhich are not as onerous as they are today.
p274
aVAt the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector,
p275
aVand create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for.
p276
aa(lp277
VThe third thing is our higher education.
p278
aVIndian higher education is completely regulated.
p279
aVIt's very difficult to start a private university.
p280
aVIt's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India.
p281
aVAs a result of that our higher education
p282
aVis simply not keeping pace with India's demands.
p283
aVThat is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address.
p284
aa(lp285
VBut most important I believe
p286
aVare the ideas we need to anticipate.
p287
aVHere India can look at what is happening in the west
p288
aVand elsewhere, and look at what needs to be done.
p289
aVThe first thing is, we're very fortunate
p290
aVthat technology is at a point
p291
aVwhere it is much more advanced
p292
aVthan when other countries had the development.
p293
aVSo we can use technology for governance.
p294
aVWe can use technology for direct benefits.
p295
aVWe can use technology for transparency, and many other things.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe second thing is, the health issue.
p298
aVIndia has equally horrible
p299
aVhealth problems of the higher state of cardiac issue,
p300
aVthe higher state of diabetes, the higher state of obesity.
p301
aVSo there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases
p302
aVwith a set of rich country diseases.
p303
aVTherefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health.
p304
aVWe really need to put in place a strategy
p305
aVso that we don't go to the other extreme of health.
p306
aa(lp307
VSimilarly today in the West
p308
aVyou're seeing the problem of entitlement \u2014
p309
aVthe cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid.
p310
aVTherefore when you are a young country,
p311
aVagain you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system
p312
aVso that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd then again, India does not have the luxury
p315
aVof making its environment dirty,
p316
aVbecause it has to marry environment and development.
p317
aVJust to give an idea, the world has to stabilize
p318
aVat something like 20 gigatons per year.
p319
aVOn a population of nine billion
p320
aVour average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year.
p321
aVIndia is already at two tons per year.
p322
aVBut if India grows at something like eight percent,
p323
aVincome per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050.
p324
aVSo we're saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.
p325
aVTherefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment,
p326
aVthe way we look at energy,
p327
aVthe way we create whole new paradigms of development.
p328
aa(lp329
VNow why does this matter to you?
p330
aVWhy does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?
p331
aVNumber one, this matters because
p332
aVthis represents more than a billion people.
p333
aVA billion people, 1/6th of the world population.
p334
aVIt matters because this is a democracy.
p335
aVAnd it is important to prove
p336
aVthat growth and democracy are not incompatible,
p337
aVthat you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society,
p338
aVand you can have growth.
p339
aVIt's important because if you solve these problems,
p340
aVyou can solve the problems of poverty in the world.
p341
aVIt's important because
p342
aVyou need it to solve the world's environment problems.
p343
aa(lp344
VIf we really want to come to a point,
p345
aVwe really want to put a cap on our carbon emission,
p346
aVwe want to really lower the use of energy \u2014
p347
aVit has to be solved in countries like India.
p348
aVYou know if you look at the development
p349
aVin the West over 200 years,
p350
aVthe average growth may have been about two percent.
p351
aVHere we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent.
p352
aVAnd that makes a huge difference.
p353
aVWhen India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent
p354
aVand the population was growing at two percent,
p355
aVits per capita income was doubling every 45 years.
p356
aVWhen the economic growth goes to eight percent
p357
aVand population growth drops to 1.5 percent,
p358
aVthen per capita income is doubling every nine years.
p359
aVIn other words, you're certainly fast-forwarding this whole process
p360
aVof a billion people going to prosperity.
p361
aVAnd you must have a clear strategy
p362
aVwhich is important for India and important for the world.
p363
aVThat is why I think all of you
p364
aVshould be equally concerned with it as I am.
p365
aVThank you very much.

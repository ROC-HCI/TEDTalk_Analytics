VI'm a neuroscientist.
p5
aVAnd in neuroscience,
p6
aVwe have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain.
p7
aVBut I want to start with the easiest question
p8
aVand the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life,
p9
aVbecause it's a fundamental question
p10
aVif we want to understand brain function.
p11
aVAnd that is, why do we and other animals
p12
aVhave brains?
p13
aVNot all species on our planet have brains,
p14
aVso if we want to know what the brain is for,
p15
aVlet's think about why we evolved one.
p16
aVNow you may reason that we have one
p17
aVto perceive the world or to think,
p18
aVand that's completely wrong.
p19
aVIf you think about this question for any length of time,
p20
aVit's blindingly obvious why we have a brain.
p21
aVWe have a brain for one reason and one reason only,
p22
aVand that's to produce adaptable and complex movements.
p23
aVThere is no other reason to have a brain.
p24
aVThink about it.
p25
aVMovement is the only way you have
p26
aVof affecting the world around you.
p27
aVNow that's not quite true. There's one other way, and that's through sweating.
p28
aVBut apart from that,
p29
aVeverything else goes through contractions of muscles.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo think about communication \u2014
p32
aVspeech, gestures, writing, sign language \u2014
p33
aVthey're all mediated through contractions of your muscles.
p34
aVSo it's really important to remember
p35
aVthat sensory, memory and cognitive processes are all important,
p36
aVbut they're only important
p37
aVto either drive or suppress future movements.
p38
aVThere can be no evolutionary advantage
p39
aVto laying down memories of childhood
p40
aVor perceiving the color of a rose
p41
aVif it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow for those who don't believe this argument,
p44
aVwe have trees and grass on our planet without the brain,
p45
aVbut the clinching evidence is this animal here \u2014
p46
aVthe humble sea squirt.
p47
aVRudimentary animal, has a nervous system,
p48
aVswims around in the ocean in its juvenile life.
p49
aVAnd at some point of its life,
p50
aVit implants on a rock.
p51
aVAnd the first thing it does in implanting on that rock, which it never leaves,
p52
aVis to digest its own brain and nervous system
p53
aVfor food.
p54
aVSo once you don't need to move,
p55
aVyou don't need the luxury of that brain.
p56
aVAnd this animal is often taken
p57
aVas an analogy to what happens at universities
p58
aVwhen professors get tenure,
p59
aVbut that's a different subject.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Applause)
p62
aa(lp63
VSo I am a movement chauvinist.
p64
aVI believe movement is the most important function of the brain \u2014
p65
aVdon't let anyone tell you that it's not true.
p66
aVNow if movement is so important,
p67
aVhow well are we doing
p68
aVunderstanding how the brain controls movement?
p69
aVAnd the answer is we're doing extremely poorly; it's a very hard problem.
p70
aVBut we can look at how well we're doing
p71
aVby thinking about how well we're doing building machines
p72
aVwhich can do what humans can do.
p73
aa(lp74
VThink about the game of chess.
p75
aVHow well are we doing determining what piece to move where?
p76
aVIf you pit Garry Kasparov here, when he's not in jail,
p77
aVagainst IBM's Deep Blue,
p78
aVwell the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win.
p79
aVAnd I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room, it would win every time.
p80
aVThat problem is solved.
p81
aVWhat about the problem
p82
aVof picking up a chess piece,
p83
aVdexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board?
p84
aVIf you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today,
p85
aVthe answer is simple:
p86
aVthe child wins easily.
p87
aVThere's no competition at all.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow why is that top problem so easy
p90
aVand the bottom problem so hard?
p91
aVOne reason is a very smart five year-old
p92
aVcould tell you the algorithm for that top problem \u2014
p93
aVlook at all possible moves to the end of the game
p94
aVand choose the one that makes you win.
p95
aVSo it's a very simple algorithm.
p96
aVNow of course there are other moves,
p97
aVbut with vast computers we approximate
p98
aVand come close to the optimal solution.
p99
aVWhen it comes to being dexterous,
p100
aVit's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous.
p101
aVAnd we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world,
p102
aVwhich has a lot of problems.
p103
aa(lp104
VBut let me show you cutting-edge robotics.
p105
aVNow a lot of robotics is very impressive,
p106
aVbut manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages.
p107
aVSo this is the end of a Ph.D. project
p108
aVfrom one of the best robotics institutes.
p109
aVAnd the student has trained this robot
p110
aVto pour this water into a glass.
p111
aVIt's a hard problem because the water sloshes about, but it can do it.
p112
aVBut it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human.
p113
aVNow if you want this robot to do a different task,
p114
aVthat's another three-year Ph.D. program.
p115
aVThere is no generalization at all
p116
aVfrom one task to another in robotics.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow we can compare this
p119
aVto cutting-edge human performance.
p120
aVSo what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox
p121
aVwinning the world record for cup stacking.
p122
aVNow the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking.
p123
aVIt's a high school sport
p124
aVwhere you have 12 cups you have to stack and unstack
p125
aVagainst the clock in a prescribed order.
p126
aVAnd this is her getting the world record in real time.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aV(Applause)
p129
aVAnd she's pretty happy.
p130
aVWe have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that,
p131
aVand that's what we'd like to know.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo in my group, what we try to do
p134
aVis reverse engineer how humans control movement.
p135
aVAnd it sounds like an easy problem.
p136
aVYou send a command down, it causes muscles to contract.
p137
aVYour arm or body moves,
p138
aVand you get sensory feedback from vision, from skin, from muscles and so on.
p139
aVThe trouble is
p140
aVthese signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be.
p141
aVSo one thing that makes controlling movement difficult
p142
aVis, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy.
p143
aVNow by noise, I do not mean sound.
p144
aVWe use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense
p145
aVmeaning a random noise corrupting a signal.
p146
aVSo the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio
p147
aVand you heard "crrcckkk" on the station you wanted to hear,
p148
aVthat was the noise.
p149
aVBut more generally, this noise is something that corrupts the signal.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo for example, if you put your hand under a table
p152
aVand try to localize it with your other hand,
p153
aVyou can be off by several centimeters
p154
aVdue to the noise in sensory feedback.
p155
aVSimilarly, when you put motor output on movement output,
p156
aVit's extremely noisy.
p157
aVForget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts,
p158
aVjust aim for the same spot over and over again.
p159
aVYou have a huge spread due to movement variability.
p160
aVAnd more than that, the outside world, or task,
p161
aVis both ambiguous and variable.
p162
aVThe teapot could be full, it could be empty.
p163
aVIt changes over time.
p164
aVSo we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow this noise is so great
p167
aVthat society places a huge premium
p168
aVon those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise.
p169
aVSo if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball
p170
aVinto a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick,
p171
aVour society will be willing to reward you
p172
aVwith hundreds of millions of dollars.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow what I want to convince you of
p175
aVis the brain also goes through a lot of effort
p176
aVto reduce the negative consequences
p177
aVof this sort of noise and variability.
p178
aVAnd to do that, I'm going to tell you about a framework
p179
aVwhich is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last 50 years
p180
aVcalled Bayesian decision theory.
p181
aVAnd it's more recently a unifying way
p182
aVto think about how the brain deals with uncertainty.
p183
aVAnd the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo let's think about the inference.
p186
aVYou want to generate beliefs about the world.
p187
aVSo what are beliefs?
p188
aVBeliefs could be: where are my arms in space?
p189
aVAm I looking at a cat or a fox?
p190
aVBut we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities.
p191
aVSo we're going to represent a belief
p192
aVwith a number between zero and one \u2014
p193
aVzero meaning I don't believe it at all, one means I'm absolutely certain.
p194
aVAnd numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty.
p195
aVAnd the key idea to Bayesian inference
p196
aVis you have two sources of information
p197
aVfrom which to make your inference.
p198
aVYou have data,
p199
aVand data in neuroscience is sensory input.
p200
aVSo I have sensory input, which I can take in to make beliefs.
p201
aVBut there's another source of information, and that's effectively prior knowledge.
p202
aVYou accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories.
p203
aVAnd the point about Bayesian decision theory
p204
aVis it gives you the mathematics
p205
aVof the optimal way to combine
p206
aVyour prior knowledge with your sensory evidence
p207
aVto generate new beliefs.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd I've put the formula up there.
p210
aVI'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful.
p211
aVAnd it has real beauty and real explanatory power.
p212
aVAnd what it really says, and what you want to estimate,
p213
aVis the probability of different beliefs
p214
aVgiven your sensory input.
p215
aVSo let me give you an intuitive example.
p216
aVImagine you're learning to play tennis
p217
aVand you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce
p218
aVas it comes over the net towards you.
p219
aVThere are two sources of information
p220
aVBayes' rule tells you.
p221
aVThere's sensory evidence \u2014 you can use visual information auditory information,
p222
aVand that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot.
p223
aVBut you know that your senses are not perfect,
p224
aVand therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land
p225
aVshown by that cloud of red,
p226
aVrepresenting numbers between 0.5 and maybe 0.1.
p227
aa(lp228
VThat information is available in the current shot,
p229
aVbut there's another source of information
p230
aVnot available on the current shot,
p231
aVbut only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis,
p232
aVand that's that the ball doesn't bounce
p233
aVwith equal probability over the court during the match.
p234
aVIf you're playing against a very good opponent,
p235
aVthey may distribute it in that green area,
p236
aVwhich is the prior distribution,
p237
aVmaking it hard for you to return.
p238
aVNow both these sources of information carry important information.
p239
aVAnd what Bayes' rule says
p240
aVis that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green
p241
aVto get the numbers of the yellow, which have the ellipses,
p242
aVand that's my belief.
p243
aVSo it's the optimal way of combining information.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow I wouldn't tell you all this if it wasn't that a few years ago,
p246
aVwe showed this is exactly what people do
p247
aVwhen they learn new movement skills.
p248
aVAnd what it means
p249
aVis we really are Bayesian inference machines.
p250
aVAs we go around, we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down,
p251
aVbut we also learn
p252
aVabout how noisy our own sensory apparatus is,
p253
aVand then combine those
p254
aVin a real Bayesian way.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula.
p257
aVAnd what this part really says
p258
aVis I have to predict the probability
p259
aVof different sensory feedbacks
p260
aVgiven my beliefs.
p261
aVSo that really means I have to make predictions of the future.
p262
aVAnd I want to convince you the brain does make predictions
p263
aVof the sensory feedback it's going to get.
p264
aVAnd moreover, it profoundly changes your perceptions
p265
aVby what you do.
p266
aVAnd to do that, I'll tell you
p267
aVabout how the brain deals with sensory input.
p268
aVSo you send a command out,
p269
aVyou get sensory feedback back,
p270
aVand that transformation is governed
p271
aVby the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus.
p272
aa(lp273
VBut you can imagine looking inside the brain.
p274
aVAnd here's inside the brain.
p275
aVYou might have a little predictor, a neural simulator,
p276
aVof the physics of your body and your senses.
p277
aVSo as you send a movement command down,
p278
aVyou tap a copy of that off
p279
aVand run it into your neural simulator
p280
aVto anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions.
p281
aVSo as I shake this ketchup bottle,
p282
aVI get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row.
p283
aVAnd if I've got a good predictor, it predicts the same thing.
p284
aa(lp285
VWell why would I bother doing that?
p286
aVI'm going to get the same feedback anyway.
p287
aVWell there's good reasons.
p288
aVImagine, as I shake the ketchup bottle,
p289
aVsomeone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me.
p290
aVNow I get an extra source of sensory information
p291
aVdue to that external act.
p292
aVSo I get two sources.
p293
aVI get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it,
p294
aVbut from my senses' point of view,
p295
aVthat is combined together into one source of information.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow there's good reason to believe
p298
aVthat you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events.
p299
aVBecause external events are actually much more behaviorally relevant
p300
aVthan feeling everything that's going on inside my body.
p301
aVSo one way to reconstruct that
p302
aVis to compare the prediction \u2014
p303
aVwhich is only based on your movement commands \u2014
p304
aVwith the reality.
p305
aVAny discrepancy should hopefully be external.
p306
aVSo as I go around the world,
p307
aVI'm making predictions of what I should get, subtracting them off.
p308
aVEverything left over is external to me.
p309
aa(lp310
VWhat evidence is there for this?
p311
aVWell there's one very clear example
p312
aVwhere a sensation generated by myself feels very different
p313
aVthen if generated by another person.
p314
aVAnd so we decided the most obvious place to start
p315
aVwas with tickling.
p316
aVIt's been known for a long time, you can't tickle yourself
p317
aVas well as other people can.
p318
aVBut it hasn't really been shown, it's because you have a neural simulator,
p319
aVsimulating your own body
p320
aVand subtracting off that sense.
p321
aVSo we can bring the experiments of the 21st century
p322
aVby applying robotic technologies to this problem.
p323
aVAnd in effect, what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot,
p324
aVand they're going to move that back and forward.
p325
aVAnd then we're going to track that with a computer
p326
aVand use it to control another robot,
p327
aVwhich is going to tickle their palm with another stick.
p328
aVAnd then we're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things
p329
aVincluding ticklishness.
p330
aa(lp331
VI'll show you just one part of our study.
p332
aVAnd here I've taken away the robots,
p333
aVbut basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward.
p334
aVAnd we replay that to the other hand with a time delay.
p335
aVEither no time delay,
p336
aVin which case light would just tickle your palm,
p337
aVor with a time delay of two-tenths of three-tenths of a second.
p338
aVSo the important point here
p339
aVis the right hand always does the same things \u2014 sinusoidal movement.
p340
aVThe left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle.
p341
aVAll we're playing with is a tempo causality.
p342
aVAnd as we go from naught to 0.1 second,
p343
aVit becomes more ticklish.
p344
aVAs you go from 0.1 to 0.2,
p345
aVit becomes more ticklish at the end.
p346
aVAnd by 0.2 of a second,
p347
aVit's equivalently ticklish
p348
aVto the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything.
p349
aVSo whatever is responsible for this cancellation
p350
aVis extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality.
p351
aVAnd based on this illustration, we really convinced ourselves in the field
p352
aVthat the brain's making precise predictions
p353
aVand subtracting them off from the sensations.
p354
aa(lp355
VNow I have to admit, these are the worst studies my lab has ever run.
p356
aVBecause the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes,
p357
aVyou need large numbers of subjects
p358
aVwith these stars making them significant.
p359
aVSo we were looking for a much more objective way
p360
aVto assess this phenomena.
p361
aVAnd in the intervening years I had two daughters.
p362
aVAnd one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys,
p363
aVthey get into fights \u2014
p364
aVwhich started with one of them doing something to the other, the other retaliating.
p365
aVIt quickly escalates.
p366
aVAnd children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force.
p367
aVNow when I screamed at my children to stop,
p368
aVsometimes they would both say to me
p369
aVthe other person hit them harder.
p370
aa(lp371
VNow I happen to know my children don't lie,
p372
aVso I thought, as a neuroscientist,
p373
aVit was important how I could explain
p374
aVhow they were telling inconsistent truths.
p375
aVAnd we hypothesize based on the tickling study
p376
aVthat when one child hits another,
p377
aVthey generate the movement command.
p378
aVThey predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off.
p379
aVSo they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have \u2014
p380
aVrather like the tickling.
p381
aVWhereas the passive recipient
p382
aVdoesn't make the prediction, feels the full blow.
p383
aVSo if they retaliate with the same force,
p384
aVthe first person will think it's been escalated.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo we decided to test this in the lab.
p387
aV(Laughter)
p388
aVNow we don't work with children, we don't work with hitting,
p389
aVbut the concept is identical.
p390
aVWe bring in two adults. We tell them they're going to play a game.
p391
aVAnd so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other.
p392
aVAnd the game is very simple.
p393
aVWe started with a motor
p394
aVwith a little lever, a little force transfuser.
p395
aVAnd we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers
p396
aVfor three seconds and then it stops.
p397
aVAnd that player's been told, remember the experience of that force
p398
aVand use your other finger
p399
aVto apply the same force
p400
aVdown to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser \u2014 and they do that.
p401
aVAnd player two's been told, remember the experience of that force.
p402
aVUse your other hand to apply the force back down.
p403
aVAnd so they take it in turns
p404
aVto apply the force they've just experienced back and forward.
p405
aa(lp406
VBut critically,
p407
aVthey're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms.
p408
aVSo they don't know the rules the other person's playing by.
p409
aVAnd what we've measured
p410
aVis the force as a function of terms.
p411
aVAnd if we look at what we start with,
p412
aVa quarter of a Newton there, a number of turns,
p413
aVperfect would be that red line.
p414
aVAnd what we see in all pairs of subjects is this \u2014
p415
aVa 70 percent escalation in force
p416
aVon each go.
p417
aVSo it really suggests, when you're doing this \u2014
p418
aVbased on this study and others we've done \u2014
p419
aVthat the brain is canceling the sensory consequences
p420
aVand underestimating the force it's producing.
p421
aVSo it re-shows the brain makes predictions
p422
aVand fundamentally changes the precepts.
p423
aVSo we've made inferences, we've done predictions,
p424
aVnow we have to generate actions.
p425
aVAnd what Bayes' rule says is, given my beliefs,
p426
aVthe action should in some sense be optimal.
p427
aa(lp428
VBut we've got a problem.
p429
aVTasks are symbolic \u2014 I want to drink, I want to dance \u2014
p430
aVbut the movement system has to contract 600 muscles
p431
aVin a particular sequence.
p432
aVAnd there's a big gap
p433
aVbetween the task and the movement system.
p434
aVSo it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways.
p435
aVSo think about just a point to point movement.
p436
aVI could choose these two paths
p437
aVout of an infinite number of paths.
p438
aVHaving chosen a particular path,
p439
aVI can hold my hand on that path
p440
aVas infinitely many different joint configurations.
p441
aVAnd I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration
p442
aVeither very stiff or very relaxed.
p443
aVSo I have a huge amount of choice to make.
p444
aVNow it turns out, we are extremely stereotypical.
p445
aVWe all move the same way pretty much.
p446
aa(lp447
VAnd so it turns out we're so stereotypical,
p448
aVour brains have got dedicated neural circuitry
p449
aVto decode this stereotyping.
p450
aVSo if I take some dots
p451
aVand set them in motion with biological motion,
p452
aVyour brain's circuitry would understand instantly what's going on.
p453
aVNow this is a bunch of dots moving.
p454
aVYou will know what this person is doing,
p455
aVwhether happy, sad, old, young \u2014 a huge amount of information.
p456
aVIf these dots were cars going on a racing circuit,
p457
aVyou would have absolutely no idea what's going on.
p458
aa(lp459
VSo why is it
p460
aVthat we move the particular ways we do?
p461
aVWell let's think about what really happens.
p462
aVMaybe we don't all quite move the same way.
p463
aVMaybe there's variation in the population.
p464
aVAnd maybe those who move better than others
p465
aVhave got more chance of getting their children into the next generation.
p466
aVSo in evolutionary scales, movements get better.
p467
aVAnd perhaps in life, movements get better through learning.
p468
aa(lp469
VSo what is it about a movement which is good or bad?
p470
aVImagine I want to intercept this ball.
p471
aVHere are two possible paths to that ball.
p472
aVWell if I choose the left-hand path,
p473
aVI can work out the forces required
p474
aVin one of my muscles as a function of time.
p475
aVBut there's noise added to this.
p476
aVSo what I actually get, based on this lovely, smooth, desired force,
p477
aVis a very noisy version.
p478
aVSo if I pick the same command through many times,
p479
aVI will get a different noisy version each time, because noise changes each time.
p480
aVSo what I can show you here
p481
aVis how the variability of the movement will evolve
p482
aVif I choose that way.
p483
aVIf I choose a different way of moving \u2014 on the right for example \u2014
p484
aVthen I'll have a different command, different noise,
p485
aVplaying through a noisy system, very complicated.
p486
aVAll we can be sure of is the variability will be different.
p487
aVIf I move in this particular way,
p488
aVI end up with a smaller variability across many movements.
p489
aVSo if I have to choose between those two,
p490
aVI would choose the right one because it's less variable.
p491
aa(lp492
VAnd the fundamental idea
p493
aVis you want to plan your movements
p494
aVso as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise.
p495
aVAnd one intuition to get
p496
aVis actually the amount of noise or variability I show here
p497
aVgets bigger as the force gets bigger.
p498
aVSo you want to avoid big forces as one principle.
p499
aVSo we've shown that using this,
p500
aVwe can explain a huge amount of data \u2014
p501
aVthat exactly people are going about their lives planning movements
p502
aVso as to minimize negative consequences of noise.
p503
aa(lp504
VSo I hope I've convinced you the brain is there
p505
aVand evolved to control movement.
p506
aVAnd it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that.
p507
aVBut it's also relevant
p508
aVfor disease and rehabilitation.
p509
aVThere are many diseases which effect movement.
p510
aVAnd hopefully if we understand how we control movement,
p511
aVwe can apply that to robotic technology.
p512
aVAnd finally, I want to remind you,
p513
aVwhen you see animals do what look like very simple tasks,
p514
aVthe actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain
p515
aVis really quite dramatic.
p516
aa(lp517
VThank you very much.
p518
aa(lp519
V(Applause)
p520
aa(lp521
VChris Anderson: Quick question for you, Dan.
p522
aVSo you're a movement \u2014 (DW: Chauvinist.) \u2014 chauvinist.
p523
aVDoes that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about \u2014
p524
aVthe dreaming, the yearning, the falling in love and all these things \u2014
p525
aVare a kind of side show, an accident?
p526
aa(lp527
VDW: No, no, actually I think they're all important
p528
aVto drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end.
p529
aVSo I think people who study sensation or memory
p530
aVwithout realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood.
p531
aVThe fact that we forget most of our childhood, for example,
p532
aVis probably fine, because it doesn't effect our movements later in life.
p533
aVYou only need to store things which are really going to effect movement.
p534
aa(lp535
VCA: So you think that people thinking about the brain, and consciousness generally,
p536
aVcould get real insight
p537
aVby saying, where does movement play in this game?
p538
aa(lp539
VDW: So people have found out for example
p540
aVthat studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision
p541
aVis a mistake.
p542
aVYou have to study vision with the realization
p543
aVof how the movement system is going to use vision.
p544
aVAnd it uses it very differently once you think about it that way.
p545
aa(lp546
VCA: Well that was quite fascinating. Thank you very much indeed.

You use it to lift things, to balance yourself, to give and take, to sense the world. It has a range of interacting degrees of freedom, and it interacts with many different objects under a variety of environmental conditions. And for most of us, it all just works. At his lab in the Engineering department at Cambridge, Daniel Wolpert and his team are studying why, looking to understand the computations underlying the brain&#39;s sensorimotor control of the body. <br /><br />As he says, &quot;I believe that to understand movement is to understand the whole brain. And therefore it&rsquo;s important to remember when you are studying memory, cognition, sensory processing, they&rsquo;re there for a reason, and that reason is action.&rdquo;&nbsp; Movement is the only way we have of interacting with the world, whether foraging for food or attracting a waiter&#39;s attention. Indeed, all communication, including speech, sign language, gestures and writing, is mediated via the motor system. Taking this viewpoint, and using computational and robotic techniques as well as virtual reality systems, Wolpert and his team research the purpose of the human brain and the way it determines future actions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "daniel_wolpert", "whotheyare": "A neuroscientist and engineer, Daniel Wolpert studies how the brain controls the body.", "whatotherssay": "A recurrent theme in Wolpert\\u2019s research is that \\u201cThe more we know about how the body acts, the more we know about how the brain thinks.\\u201d", "id": 1036, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/72864c7e09c0866e7e3e3a3049daef7c890cc38e_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "The real reason for brains", "take_action": null, "comments": 8052, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/794a93b76d7c657c2eb52e229c4b20e583615e06_1600x1200.jpg", "description": "Neuroscientist Daniel Wolpert starts from a surprising premise: the brain evolved, not to think or feel, but to control movement.

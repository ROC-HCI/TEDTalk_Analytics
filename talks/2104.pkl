VI have the feeling that we can all agree
p5
aVthat we're moving towards a new
p6
aVmodel of the state and society.
p7
aVBut, we're absolutely clueless as to what this is
p8
aVor what it should be.
p9
aVIt seems like we need to have
p10
aVa conversation about democracy
p11
aa(lp12
Vin our day and age.
p13
aVLet's think about it this way:
p14
aVWe are 21st-century citizens, doing our
p15
aVvery, very best to interact with 19th century-designed institutions
p16
aVthat are based on an information technology of the 15th century.
p17
aVLet's have a look at some of the
p18
aVcharacteristics of this system.
p19
aVFirst of all, it's designed for an information technology
p20
aVthat's over 500 years old.
p21
aVAnd the best possible system
p22
aVthat could be designed for it
p23
aVis one where the few make daily decisions
p24
aVin the name of the many.
p25
aVAnd the many get to vote once every  couple of years.
p26
aVIn the second place, the costs of
p27
aVparticipating in this system are
p28
aVincredibly high.
p29
aVYou either have to have a fair  bit of money
p30
aVand influence, or you have to devote your entire
p31
aVlife to politics.
p32
aVYou have to become a party member
p33
aVand slowly start working up the ranks
p34
aVuntil maybe, one day, you'll get  to sit at a table
p35
aVwhere a decision is being made.
p36
aVAnd last but not least,
p37
aVthe language of the system \u2014
p38
aVit's incredibly cryptic.
p39
aVIt's done for lawyers, by lawyers,
p40
aa(lp41
Vand no one else can understand.
p42
aVSo, it's a system where we can
p43
aVchoose our authorities,
p44
aVbut we are completely left out on how those authorities
p45
aVreach their decisions.
p46
aVSo, in a day where a new information technology
p47
aVallows us to participate globally in any conversation,
p48
aVour barriers of information are completely lowered
p49
aVand we can, more than ever before,
p50
aVexpress our desires and our concerns.
p51
aVOur political system remains the same
p52
aVfor the past 200 years
p53
aVand expects us to be contented with being  simply passive recipients
p54
aa(lp55
Vof a monologue.
p56
aVSo, it's really not surprising that
p57
aVthis kind of system is only able to produce
p58
aVtwo kinds of results:
p59
aVsilence or noise.
p60
aVSilence, in terms of citizens not engaging,
p61
aVsimply not wanting to participate.
p62
aVThere's this commonplace  [idea] that I truly, truly dislike,
p63
aVand it's this idea that we citizens are naturally
p64
aVapathetic. That we shun commitment.
p65
aVBut, can you really blame us
p66
aVfor not jumping at the opportunity of going
p67
aVto the middle of the city in the middle
p68
aVof a working day to attend, physically,
p69
aVa public hearing that has no impact
p70
aVwhatsoever?
p71
aVConflict is bound to happen between a system
p72
aVthat no longer represents, nor has any dialogue capacity,
p73
aVand citizens that are increasingly used
p74
aVto representing themselves.
p75
aVAnd, then we find noise:
p76
aVChile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico Italy, France, Spain, the United States,
p77
aVthey're all democracies.
p78
aVTheir citizens have access to
p79
aVthe ballot boxes. But they still feel the need,
p80
aa(lp81
Vthey need to take to the streets in order  to be heard.
p82
aVTo me, it seems like the 18th-century
p83
aVslogan that was the basis for the formation
p84
aVof our modern democracies, "No taxation
p85
aVwithout representation,"
p86
aVcan now be updated to "No representation without a conversation."
p87
aVWe want our seat at the table.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd rightly so.
p90
aVBut in order to be part of this conversation,
p91
aVwe need to know what we want to do next,
p92
aVbecause political action is being able
p93
aVto move from agitation
p94
aVto construction.
p95
aVMy generation has been incredibly good at
p96
aVusing new networks and technologies
p97
aVto organize protests,
p98
aVprotests that were able to successfully
p99
aVimpose agendas,
p100
aVroll back extremely pernicious legislation,
p101
aVand even overthrow authoritarian governments.
p102
aVAnd we should be immensely
p103
aVproud of this.
p104
aVBut, we also must admit that we
p105
aVhaven't been good at using those
p106
aVsame networks and technologies
p107
aVto successfully articulate an alternative to what we're seeing
p108
aVand find the consensus and build  the alliances that are needed
p109
aa(lp110
Vto make it happen.
p111
aVAnd so the risk that we face
p112
aVis that we can create these huge power vacuums
p113
aVthat will very quickly get filled up by de facto
p114
aVpowers, like the military or highly
p115
aVmotivated and already organized groups
p116
aa(lp117
Vthat generally lie on the extremes.
p118
aVBut our democracy is neither
p119
aVjust a matter of voting once every
p120
aVcouple of years.
p121
aVBut it's not either the ability to bring millions onto the streets.
p122
aVSo the question I'd like to raise here,
p123
aVand I do believe it's the most important  question we need to answer,
p124
aVis this one:
p125
aVIf Internet is the new printing press,
p126
aVthen what is democracy for the Internet era?
p127
aVWhat institutions do we want to build
p128
aa(lp129
Vfor the 21st-century society?
p130
aVI don't have the answer, just in case.
p131
aVI don't think anyone does.
p132
aVBut I truly believe we can't afford to ignore this question anymore.
p133
aVSo, I'd like to share our experience
p134
aVand what we've learned so far
p135
aVand hopefully contribute two cents
p136
aa(lp137
Vto this conversation.
p138
aVTwo years ago, with a group of friends from Argentina,
p139
aVwe started thinking, "how can  we get our representatives,
p140
aVour elected representatives,
p141
aVto represent us?"
p142
aVMarshall McLuhan once said that politics
p143
aVis solving today's problems with yesterday's tools.
p144
aVSo the question that motivated us was,
p145
aVcan we try and solve some of today's problems
p146
aVwith the tools that we use every single day of our lives?
p147
aVOur first approach was to design and develop
p148
aVa piece of software called DemocracyOS.
p149
aVDemocracyOS is an open-source web application
p150
aVthat is designed to become a bridge
p151
aVbetween citizens and their elected representatives
p152
aa(lp153
Vto make it easier for us to participate  from our everyday lives.
p154
aVSo first of all, you can get informed so every new
p155
aVproject that gets introduced in Congress
p156
aVgets immediately translated and explained
p157
aVin plain language on this platform.
p158
aVBut we all know that social change
p159
aVis not going to come from just knowing
p160
aVmore information,
p161
aVbut from doing something with it.
p162
aVSo better access to information
p163
aVshould lead to a conversation
p164
aVabout what we're going to do next,
p165
aVand DemocracyOS allows for that.
p166
aVBecause we believe that democracy is
p167
aVnot just a matter of stacking up
p168
aVpreferences, one on top of each other,
p169
aVbut that our healthy and robust public debate
p170
aa(lp171
Vshould be, once again, one of its fundamental values.
p172
aVSo DemocracyOS is about persuading  and being persuaded.
p173
aVIt's about reaching a consensus
p174
aVas much as finding a proper way
p175
aVof channeling our disagreement.
p176
aVAnd finally, you can vote
p177
aVhow you would like your elected  representative to vote.
p178
aVAnd if you do not feel comfortable
p179
aVvoting on a certain issue,
p180
aVyou can always delegate your vote
p181
aVto someone else, allowing
p182
aa(lp183
Vfor a dynamic and emerging social leadership.
p184
aVIt suddenly became very easy for us
p185
aVto simply compare these results
p186
aVwith how our representatives were
p187
aVvoting in Congress.
p188
aVBut, it also became very evident that
p189
aVtechnology was not going to do the trick.
p190
aVWhat we needed to do to was to find
p191
aVactors that were able to
p192
aVgrab this distributed knowledge
p193
aVin society and use it to make better and more fair decisions.
p194
aVSo we reached out to traditional political parties
p195
aVand we offered them DemocracyOS.
p196
aVWe said, "Look, here you have a platform that you can use to build
p197
aVa two-way conversation with your constituencies."
p198
aVAnd yes, we failed.
p199
aVWe failed big time.
p200
aVWe were sent to play  outside like little kids.
p201
aVAmongst other things, we were called naive.
p202
aVAnd I must be honest: I think, in hindsight, we were.
p203
aVBecause the challenges that we face, they're not
p204
aVtechnological, they're cultural.
p205
aVPolitical parties were never willing
p206
aVto change the way they make their decisions.
p207
aVSo it suddenly became a bit obvious
p208
aVthat if we wanted to move forward with this idea,
p209
aa(lp210
Vwe needed to do it ourselves.
p211
aVAnd so we took quite a leap of faith,
p212
aVand in August last year, we founded
p213
aVour own political party,
p214
aVEl Partido de la Red,
p215
aVor the Net Party, in the city of  Buenos Aires.
p216
aVAnd taking an even bigger leap of faith,
p217
aVwe ran for elections in October last year
p218
aVwith this idea:
p219
aVif we want a seat in Congress,
p220
aVour candidate, our representatives
p221
aVwere always going to vote according to
p222
aVwhat citizens decided on DemocracyOS.
p223
aVEvery single project that got introduced
p224
aVin Congress, we were going vote
p225
aVaccording to what citizens decided on an online platform.
p226
aVIt was our way of hacking the political system.
p227
aVWe understood that if we wanted
p228
aVto become part of the conversation,
p229
aVto have a seat at the table,
p230
aVwe needed to become valid stakeholders,
p231
aa(lp232
Vand the only way of doing it is to play by the  system rules.
p233
aVBut we were hacking it in the sense that
p234
aVwe were radically changing the way a political party
p235
aVmakes its decisions.
p236
aVFor the first time, we were making our decisions
p237
aVtogether with those who we were
p238
aa(lp239
Vaffecting directly by those decisions.
p240
aVIt was a very, very bold move for a two-month-old party
p241
aVin the city of Buenos Aires.
p242
aVBut it got attention.
p243
aVWe got 22,000 votes, that's 1.2 percent of the votes,
p244
aVand we came in second for the local options.
p245
aVSo, even if that wasn't enough to win a
p246
aVseat in Congress, it was enough
p247
aVfor us to become part of the conversation,
p248
aVto the extent that next month,
p249
aVCongress, as an institution, is launching
p250
aVfor the first time in Argentina's history,
p251
aVa DemocracyOS to discuss,
p252
aVwith the citizens, three pieces of legislation:
p253
aVtwo on urban transportation and
p254
aa(lp255
Vone on the use of public space.
p256
aVOf course, our elected representatives are not
p257
aVsaying, "Yes, we're going to vote
p258
aVaccording to what citizens decide,"
p259
aVbut they're willing to try.
p260
aVThey're willing to open up a new space
p261
aVfor citizen engagement and hopefully
p262
aa(lp263
Vthey'll be willing to listen as well.
p264
aVOur political system can be transformed,
p265
aVand not by subverting it, by destroying it,
p266
aVbut by rewiring it with the tools that
p267
aa(lp268
VInternet affords us now.
p269
aVBut a real challenge is to find, to design
p270
aVto create, to empower those connectors
p271
aVthat are able to innovate, to transform
p272
aVnoise and silence into signal
p273
aVand finally bring our democracies
p274
aa(lp275
Vto the 21st century.
p276
aVI'm not saying it's easy.
p277
aVBut in our experience, we actually stand a chance
p278
aVof making it work.
p279
aVAnd in my heart, it's most definitely
p280
aVworth trying.
p281
aVThank you.
p282
aV(Applause)

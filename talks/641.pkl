VGood morning. I think, as a grumpy Eastern European,
p5
aVI was brought in to play the pessimist this morning. So bear with me.
p6
aVWell, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus,
p7
aVwhich, as some of you may know,
p8
aVis not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy.
p9
aVSo that's why I've always been fascinated
p10
aVwith how technology could actually reshape
p11
aVand open up authoritarian societies like ours.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, I'm graduating college
p14
aVand, feeling very idealistic,
p15
aVI decided to join the NGO
p16
aVwhich actually was using new media
p17
aVto promote democracy and media reform
p18
aVin much of the former Soviet Union.
p19
aVHowever, to my surprise,
p20
aVI discovered that dictatorships
p21
aVdo not crumble so easily.
p22
aVIn fact, some of them actually
p23
aVsurvived the Internet challenge,
p24
aVand some got even more repressive.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo this is when I ran out of my idealism and
p27
aVdecided to quit my NGO job
p28
aVand actually study how the Internet could impede democratization.
p29
aVNow, I must tell you that this was never
p30
aVa very popular argument,
p31
aVand it's probably not very popular yet
p32
aVwith some of you sitting in this audience.
p33
aVIt was never popular with many political leaders,
p34
aVespecially those in the United States
p35
aVwho somehow thought that new media
p36
aVwould be able to do what missiles couldn't.
p37
aVThat is, promote democracy in difficult places
p38
aVwhere everything else has already been tried and failed.
p39
aVAnd I think by 2009,
p40
aVthis news has finally reached Britain,
p41
aVso I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well.
p42
aa(lp43
VHowever, there is an underlying argument about logistics,
p44
aVwhich has driven so much of this debate. Right?
p45
aVSo if you look at it close enough,
p46
aVyou'll actually see that much of this
p47
aVis about economics.
p48
aVThe cybertopians say, much like fax machines
p49
aVand Xerox machines did in the '80s,
p50
aVblogs and social networks
p51
aVhave radically transformed the economics of protest,
p52
aVso people would inevitably rebel.
p53
aVTo put it very simply,
p54
aVthe assumption so far has been
p55
aVthat if you give people enough connectivity,
p56
aVif you give them enough devices,
p57
aVdemocracy will inevitably follow.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd to tell you the truth,
p60
aVI never really bought into this argument,
p61
aVin part because I never saw three American presidents
p62
aVagree on anything else in the past.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVBut, you know, even beyond that,
p65
aVif you think about the logic underlying it,
p66
aVis something I call iPod liberalism,
p67
aVwhere we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese
p68
aVwho happens to have and love his iPod
p69
aVwill also love liberal democracy.
p70
aVAnd again, I think this is kind of false.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut I think a much bigger problem with this
p73
aVis that this logic \u2014
p74
aVthat we should be dropping iPods not bombs \u2014
p75
aVI mean, it would make a fascinating title
p76
aVfor Thomas Friedman's new book.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVBut this is rarely a good sign. Right?
p79
aVSo, the bigger problem with this logic
p80
aVis that it confuses the intended
p81
aVversus the actual uses of technology.
p82
aVFor those of you who think that
p83
aVnew media of the Internet
p84
aVcould somehow help us avert genocide,
p85
aVshould look no further than Rwanda,
p86
aVwhere in the '90s it was actually two radio stations
p87
aVwhich were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut even beyond that, coming back to the Internet,
p90
aVwhat you can actually see
p91
aVis that certain governments
p92
aVhave mastered the use of cyberspace
p93
aVfor propaganda purposes. Right?
p94
aVAnd they are building what I call the Spinternet.
p95
aVThe combination of spin, on the one hand,
p96
aVand the Internet on the other.
p97
aVSo governments from Russia to China to Iran
p98
aVare actually hiring, training and paying bloggers
p99
aVin order to leave ideological comments
p100
aVand create a lot of ideological blog posts
p101
aVto comment on sensitive political issues. Right?
p102
aa(lp103
VSo you may wonder, why on Earth are they doing it?
p104
aVWhy are they engaging with cyberspace?
p105
aVWell my theory is that
p106
aVit's happening because censorship actually
p107
aVis less effective than you think it is in many of those places.
p108
aVThe moment you put something critical in a blog,
p109
aVeven if you manage to ban it immediately,
p110
aVit will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs.
p111
aVSo the more you block it,
p112
aVthe more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship
p113
aVand thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.
p114
aVSo the only way to control this message
p115
aVis actually to try to spin it
p116
aVand accuse anyone who has written something critical
p117
aVof being, for example, a CIA agent.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd, again, this is happening quite often.
p120
aVJust to give you an example of how it works in China, for example.
p121
aVThere was a big case in February 2009
p122
aVcalled "Elude the Cat."
p123
aVAnd for those of you who didn't know, I'll just give a little summary.
p124
aVSo what happened is that a 24-year-old man,
p125
aVa Chinese man, died in prison custody.
p126
aVAnd police said that it happened
p127
aVbecause he was playing hide and seek,
p128
aVwhich is "elude the cat" in Chinese slang,
p129
aVwith other inmates and hit his head
p130
aVagainst the wall,
p131
aVwhich was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments.
p134
aVIn fact, QQ.com, which is a popular Chinese website,
p135
aVhad 35,000 comments
p136
aVon this issue within hours.
p137
aVBut then authorities did something very smart.
p138
aVInstead of trying to purge these comments,
p139
aVthey instead went and reached out to the bloggers.
p140
aVAnd they basically said, "Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators."
p141
aVSo 500 people applied,
p142
aVand four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question,
p143
aVand thus inspect it and then blog about it.
p144
aVWithin days the entire incident was forgotten,
p145
aVwhich would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content.
p146
aVPeople would keep talking about it for weeks.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd this actually fits with another interesting theory
p149
aVabout what's happening in authoritarian states
p150
aVand in their cyberspace.
p151
aVThis is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation,
p152
aVand it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics
p153
aVand letting them engage with each other online.
p154
aVWe tend to think
p155
aVthat somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships,
p156
aVbut in many cases it only strengthens them.
p157
aVAnd you may wonder why.
p158
aVI'll just give you a very short list of reasons
p159
aVwhy authoritarian deliberation
p160
aVmay actually help the dictators.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd first it's quite simple.
p163
aVMost of them operate in a complete information vacuum.
p164
aVThey don't really have the data they need
p165
aVin order to identify emerging threats facing the regime.
p166
aVSo encouraging people to actually go online
p167
aVand share information and data
p168
aVon blogs and wikis is great
p169
aVbecause otherwise, low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats
p170
aVwill continue concealing what's actually happening in the country, right?
p171
aVSo from this perspective, having blogs and wikis
p172
aVproduce knowledge has been great.
p173
aa(lp174
VSecondly, involving public in any decision making
p175
aVis also great
p176
aVbecause it helps you to share the blame
p177
aVfor the policies which eventually fail.
p178
aVBecause they say, "Well look, we asked you,
p179
aVwe consulted you, you voted on it.
p180
aVYou put it on the front page of your blog.
p181
aVWell, great. You are the one who is to blame."
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd finally, the purpose of
p184
aVany authoritarian deliberation efforts
p185
aVis usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes, both at home and abroad.
p186
aVSo inviting people to all sorts of public forums,
p187
aVhaving them participate in decision making,
p188
aVit's actually great.
p189
aVBecause what happens is that then
p190
aVyou can actually point to this initiative and say,
p191
aV"Well, we are having a democracy. We are having a forum."
p192
aa(lp193
VJust to give you an example,
p194
aVone of the Russian regions, for example,
p195
aVnow involves its citizens
p196
aVin planning its strategy up until year 2020.
p197
aVRight? So they can go online
p198
aVand contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020.
p199
aVI mean, anyone who has been to Russia would know
p200
aVthat there was no planning in Russia for the next month.
p201
aVSo having people involved in planning for 2020
p202
aVis not necessarily going to change anything,
p203
aVbecause the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda.
p204
aa(lp205
VJust to give you an example from Iran,
p206
aVwe all heard about the Twitter revolution
p207
aVthat happened there,
p208
aVbut if you look close enough, you'll actually see
p209
aVthat many of the networks and blogs
p210
aVand Twitter and Facebook were actually operational.
p211
aVThey may have become slower,
p212
aVbut the activists could still access it
p213
aVand actually argue that having access to them
p214
aVis actually great for many authoritarian states.
p215
aVAnd it's great simply because
p216
aVthey can gather open source intelligence.
p217
aa(lp218
VIn the past it would take you weeks, if not months,
p219
aVto identify how Iranian activists connect to each other.
p220
aVNow you actually know how they connect to each other
p221
aVby looking at their Facebook page.
p222
aVI mean KGB, and not just KGB,
p223
aVused to torture in order to actually get this data.
p224
aVNow it's all available online.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VBut I think the biggest conceptual pitfall
p228
aVthat cybertopians made
p229
aVis when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online.
p230
aVWe often hear about cyber activism,
p231
aVhow people are getting more active because of the Internet.
p232
aVRarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example,
p233
aVhow people are becoming passive.
p234
aVWhy? Because they somehow assume that the Internet
p235
aVis going to be the catalyst of change
p236
aVthat will push young people into the streets,
p237
aVwhile in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses
p238
aVwhich will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography.
p239
aVThat's not an option being considered too strongly.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran,
p242
aVthere may as well be two digital captives
p243
aVwho are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.
p244
aVAnd this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it
p245
aVbecause the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people
p246
aVand it plays a completely different social role for them.
p247
aa(lp248
VIf you look at some of the surveys
p249
aVon how the young people actually benefit from the Internet,
p250
aVyou'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example,
p251
aVfor whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life,
p252
aVis three times more than in the United States.
p253
aVSo it does play a social role,
p254
aVhowever it may not necessarily lead to political engagement.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo the way I tend to think of it
p257
aVis like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space,
p258
aVa total rip-off from Abraham Maslow.
p259
aVBut the point here is that
p260
aVwhen we get the remote Russian village online,
p261
aVwhat will get people to the Internet
p262
aVis not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch.
p263
aVIt's going to be pornography, "Sex and the City,"
p264
aVor maybe watching funny videos of cats.
p265
aVSo this is something you have to recognize.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo what should we do about it?
p268
aVWell I say we have to stop thinking
p269
aVabout the number of iPods per capita
p270
aVand start thinking about ways in which
p271
aVwe can empower intellectuals,
p272
aVdissidents, NGOs and then the members of civil society.
p273
aVBecause even what has been happening up 'til now
p274
aVwith the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation,
p275
aVthere is a great chance that those voices will not be heard.
p276
aVSo I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions
p277
aVand actually start doing something about it.
p278
aVThank you.
p279
aV(Applause)

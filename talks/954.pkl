VIf you really want to understand
p5
aVthe problem that we're facing with the oceans,
p6
aVyou have to think about the biology
p7
aVat the same time you think about the physics.
p8
aVWe can't solve the problems
p9
aVunless we start studying the ocean
p10
aVin a very much more interdisciplinary way.
p11
aVSo I'm going to demonstrate that through
p12
aVdiscussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean.
p13
aVWe'll look at sea level rise.
p14
aVWe'll look at ocean warming.
p15
aVAnd then the last thing on the list there, ocean acidification \u2014
p16
aVif you were to ask me, you know, "What do you worry about the most?
p17
aVWhat frightens you?"
p18
aVfor me, it's ocean acidification.
p19
aVAnd this has come onto the stage pretty recently.
p20
aVSo I will spend a little time at the end.
p21
aa(lp22
VI was in Copenhagen in December
p23
aVlike a number of you in this room.
p24
aVAnd I think we all found it, simultaneously,
p25
aVan eye-opening
p26
aVand a very frustrating experience.
p27
aVI sat in this large negotiation hall,
p28
aVat one point, for three or four hours,
p29
aVwithout hearing the word "oceans" one time.
p30
aVIt really wasn't on the radar screen.
p31
aVThe nations that brought it up
p32
aVwhen we had the speeches of the national leaders \u2014
p33
aVit tended to be the leaders of the small island states,
p34
aVthe low-lying island states.
p35
aVAnd by this weird quirk
p36
aVof alphabetical order of the nations,
p37
aVa lot of the low-lying states,
p38
aVlike Kiribati and Nauru,
p39
aVthey were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows.
p40
aVYou know, they were marginalized
p41
aVin the negotiation room.
p42
aa(lp43
VOne of the problems
p44
aVis coming up with the right target.
p45
aVIt's not clear what the target should be.
p46
aVAnd how can you figure out how to fix something
p47
aVif you don't have a clear target?
p48
aVNow, you've heard about "two degrees":
p49
aVthat we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees.
p50
aVBut there's not a lot of science behind that number.
p51
aVWe've also talked about
p52
aVconcentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
p53
aVShould it be 450? Should it be 400?
p54
aVThere's not a lot of science behind that one either.
p55
aVMost of the science that is behind these numbers,
p56
aVthese potential targets,
p57
aVis based on studies on land.
p58
aVAnd I would say, for the people that work in the ocean
p59
aVand think about what the targets should be,
p60
aVwe would argue that they must be much lower.
p61
aVYou know, from an oceanic perspective,
p62
aV450 is way too high.
p63
aVNow there's compelling evidence
p64
aVthat it really needs to be 350.
p65
aVWe are, right now, at 390 parts per million
p66
aVof CO2 in the atmosphere.
p67
aVWe're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450,
p68
aVso we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot,
p69
aVand the discussion as we go forward
p70
aVhas to focus on how far the overshoot goes
p71
aVand what's the pathway back to 350.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, why is this so complicated?
p74
aVWhy don't we know some of these things a little bit better?
p75
aVWell, the problem is that
p76
aVwe've got very complicated forces in the climate system.
p77
aVThere's all kinds of natural causes of climate change.
p78
aVThere's air-sea interactions.
p79
aVHere in Galapagos,
p80
aVwe're affected by El Ninos and La Nina.
p81
aVBut the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino.
p82
aVVolcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere.
p83
aVThat changes our climate.
p84
aVThe ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet.
p85
aVSo anything that influences
p86
aVhow ocean surface waters mix with the deep water
p87
aVchanges the ocean of the planet.
p88
aVAnd we know the solar output's not constant through time.
p89
aVSo those are all natural causes of climate change.
p90
aVAnd then we have the human-induced causes
p91
aVof climate change as well.
p92
aVWe're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land,
p93
aVthe reflectivity.
p94
aVWe inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere,
p95
aVand we have trace gases, and not just carbon dioxide \u2014
p96
aVit's methane, ozone,
p97
aVoxides of sulfur and nitrogen.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question.
p100
aVIs CO2 produced by man's activities
p101
aVcausing the planet to warm up?
p102
aVBut to answer that question,
p103
aVto make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide,
p104
aVyou have to know something about
p105
aVall of these other agents of change.
p106
aVBut the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things.
p107
aVYou know, thousands of scientists
p108
aVhave been working on understanding
p109
aVall of these man-made causes
p110
aVand the natural causes.
p111
aVAnd we've got it worked out, and we can say,
p112
aV"Yes, CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now."
p113
aVNow, we have many ways to study natural variability.
p114
aVI'll show you a few examples of this now.
p115
aa(lp116
VThis is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic.
p117
aVIt's a scientific drilling vessel.
p118
aVWe go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed
p119
aVto recover sediments
p120
aVthat tell us stories of climate change, right.
p121
aVLike one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future
p122
aVis to drill down in time
p123
aVto the last period
p124
aVwhere we had CO2 double what it is today.
p125
aVAnd so that's what we've done with this ship.
p126
aVThis was \u2014 this is south of the Antarctic Circle.
p127
aVIt looks downright tropical there.
p128
aVOne day where we had calm seas and sun,
p129
aVwhich was the reason I could get off the ship.
p130
aVMost of the time it looked like this.
p131
aVWe had a waves up to 50 ft.
p132
aVand winds averaging
p133
aVabout 40 knots for most of the voyage
p134
aVand up to 70 or 80 knots.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo that trip just ended,
p137
aVand I can't show you too many results from that right now,
p138
aVbut we'll go back one more year,
p139
aVto another drilling expedition I've been involved in.
p140
aVThis was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish.
p141
aVIt's the ANDRILL project.
p142
aVAnd we made the very first bore hole
p143
aVthrough the largest floating ice shelf on the planet.
p144
aVThis is a crazy thing, this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket
p145
aVto keep everybody warm,
p146
aVdrilling at temperatures of minus 40.
p147
aVAnd we drilled in the Ross Sea.
p148
aVThat's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there.
p149
aVSo, this huge floating ice shelf
p150
aVthe size of Alaska
p151
aVcomes from West Antarctica.
p152
aVNow, West Antarctica is the part of the continent
p153
aVwhere the ice is grounded on sea floor
p154
aVas much as 2,000 meters deep.
p155
aVSo that ice sheet is partly floating,
p156
aVand it's exposed to the ocean, to the ocean heat.
p157
aa(lp158
VThis is the part of Antarctica that we worry about.
p159
aVBecause it's partly floating, you can imagine,
p160
aVis sea level rises a little bit,
p161
aVthe ice lifts off the bed, and then it can break off and float north.
p162
aVWhen that ice melts, sea level rises by six meters.
p163
aVSo we drill back in time to see how often that's happened,
p164
aVand exactly how fast that ice can melt.
p165
aVHere's the cartoon on the left there.
p166
aVWe drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf
p167
aVthen through 900 meters of water
p168
aVand then 1,300 meters into the sea floor.
p169
aVSo it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled.
p170
aa(lp171
VIt took about 10 years to put this project together.
p172
aVAnd here's what we found.
p173
aVNow, there's 40 scientists working on this project,
p174
aVand people are doing all kinds of really complicated
p175
aVand expensive analyses.
p176
aVBut it turns out, you know, the thing that told the best story
p177
aVwas this simple visual description.
p178
aVYou know, we saw this in the core samples as they came up.
p179
aVWe saw these alternations
p180
aVbetween sediments that look like this \u2014
p181
aVthere's gravel and cobbles in there
p182
aVand a bunch of sand.
p183
aVThat's the kind of material in the deep sea.
p184
aVIt can only get there if it's carried out by ice.
p185
aVSo we know there's an ice shelf overhead.
p186
aVAnd that alternates with a sediment that looks like this.
p187
aVThis is absolutely beautiful stuff.
p188
aVThis sediment is 100 percent made up
p189
aVof the shells of microscopic plants.
p190
aVAnd these plants need sunlight,
p191
aVso we know when we find that sediment
p192
aVthere's no ice overhead.
p193
aVAnd we saw about 35 alternations
p194
aVbetween open water and ice-covered water,
p195
aVbetween gravels and these plant sediments.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo what that means is, what it tells us
p198
aVis that the Ross Sea region, this ice shelf,
p199
aVmelted back and formed anew
p200
aVabout 35 times.
p201
aVAnd this is in the past four million years.
p202
aVThis was completely unexpected.
p203
aVNobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
p204
aVwas this dynamic.
p205
aVIn fact, the lore for many years has been,
p206
aV"The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago,
p207
aVand it's been there ever since."
p208
aVAnd now we know that in our recent past
p209
aVit melted back and formed again,
p210
aVand sea level went up and down, six meters at a time.
p211
aa(lp212
VWhat caused it?
p213
aVWell, we're pretty sure that it's very small changes
p214
aVin the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica,
p215
aVjust caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth.
p216
aVBut here's the key thing:
p217
aVyou know, the other thing we found out
p218
aVis that the ice sheet passed a threshold,
p219
aVthat the planet warmed up enough \u2014
p220
aVand the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade \u2014
p221
aVthe planet warmed up enough that it became ...
p222
aVthat ice sheet became very dynamic
p223
aVand was very easily melted.
p224
aVAnd you know what?
p225
aVWe've actually changed the temperature in the last century
p226
aVjust the right amount.
p227
aVSo many of us are convinced now
p228
aVthat West Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is starting to melt.
p229
aVWe do expect to see a sea-level rise
p230
aVon the order of one to two meters by the end of this century.
p231
aVAnd it could be larger than that.
p232
aVThis is a serious consequence
p233
aVfor nations like Kiribati,
p234
aVyou know, where the average elevation
p235
aVis about a little over a meter above sea level.
p236
aa(lp237
VOkay, the second story takes place here in Galapagos.
p238
aVThis is a bleached coral,
p239
aVcoral that died during the 1982-'83 El Nino.
p240
aVThis is from Champion Island.
p241
aVIt's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony.
p242
aVAnd it's covered with algae. That's what happens.
p243
aVWhen these things die,
p244
aVimmediately, organisms come in
p245
aVand encrust and live on that dead surface.
p246
aVAnd so, when a coral colony is killed
p247
aVby an El Nino event,
p248
aVit leaves this indelible record.
p249
aVYou can go then and study corals
p250
aVand figure out how often do you see this.
p251
aVSo one of the things thought of in the '80s
p252
aVwas to go back and take cores
p253
aVof coral heads throughout the Galapagos
p254
aVand find out how often was there a devastating event.
p255
aVAnd just so you know, 1982-'83,
p256
aVthat El Nino killed 95 percent
p257
aVof all the corals here in Galapagos.
p258
aVThen there was similar mortality in '97-'98.
p259
aVAnd what we found
p260
aVafter drilling back in time two to 400 years
p261
aVwas that these were unique events.
p262
aVWe saw no other mass mortality events.
p263
aVSo these events in our recent past really are unique.
p264
aVSo they're either just truly monster El Ninos,
p265
aVor they're just very strong El Ninos
p266
aVthat occurred against a backdrop of global warming.
p267
aVEither case, it's bad news
p268
aVfor the corals of the Galapagos Islands.
p269
aa(lp270
VHere's how we sample the corals.
p271
aVThis is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster.
p272
aVThis coral is eight meters tall, right.
p273
aVAnd it been growing for about 600 years.
p274
aVNow, Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral.
p275
aVAnd she was diving here with John Lauret \u2014 I think it was 1994 \u2014
p276
aVand collected a little nugget and sent it to me.
p277
aVAnd we started working on it,
p278
aVand we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean
p279
aVfrom analyzing a coral like this.
p280
aVSo we have a diamond drill.
p281
aVWe're not killing the colony; we're taking a small core sample out of the top.
p282
aVThe core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone.
p283
aVAnd that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it.
p284
aVYou can see some of the coral cores there on the right.
p285
aa(lp286
VSo we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific.
p287
aVWe're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well.
p288
aVI'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands.
p289
aVAnd we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay.
p290
aVThat the place where,
p291
aVduring an earthquake in 1954,
p292
aVthis marine terrace was lifted up
p293
aVout of the ocean very quickly,
p294
aVand it was lifted up about six to seven meters.
p295
aVAnd so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet.
p296
aVIf you go on the ground there, it looks like this,
p297
aVand this is the grandaddy coral.
p298
aVIt's 11 meters in diameter,
p299
aVand we know that it started growing
p300
aVin the year 1584.
p301
aVImagine that.
p302
aVAnd that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters,
p303
aVuntil 1954, when the earthquake happened.
p304
aa(lp305
VNow the reason we know it's 1584
p306
aVis that these corals have growth bands.
p307
aVWhen you cut them, slice those cores in half and x-ray them,
p308
aVyou see these light and dark bands.
p309
aVEach one of those is a year.
p310
aVWe know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year.
p311
aVAnd we just count on down to the bottom.
p312
aVThen their other attribute is
p313
aVthat they have this great chemistry.
p314
aVWe can analyze the carbonate
p315
aVthat makes up the coral,
p316
aVand there's a whole bunch of things we can do.
p317
aVBut in this case, we measured the different isotopes of oxygen.
p318
aVTheir ratio tells us the water temperature.
p319
aVIn this example here,
p320
aVwe had monitored this reef in Galapagos
p321
aVwith temperature recorders,
p322
aVso we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in.
p323
aVThen after we harvest a coral, we measure this ratio,
p324
aVand now you can see, those curves match perfectly.
p325
aa(lp326
VIn this case, at these islands,
p327
aVyou know, corals
p328
aVare instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water.
p329
aVAnd of course, our thermometers
p330
aVonly take us back 50 years or so here.
p331
aVThe coral can take us back
p332
aVhundreds and thousands of years.
p333
aVSo, what we do:
p334
aVwe've merged a lot of different data sets.
p335
aVIt's not just my group; there's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this.
p336
aVBut we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records
p337
aVof temperature change that go back hundreds of years,
p338
aVand we put them together.
p339
aVHere's a synthetic diagram.
p340
aVThere's a whole family of curves here.
p341
aa(lp342
VBut what's happening: we're looking at the last thousand years
p343
aVof temperature on the planet.
p344
aVAnd there's five or six different compilations there,
p345
aVBut each one of those compilations reflects input
p346
aVfrom hundreds of these kinds of records from corals.
p347
aVWe do similar things with ice cores.
p348
aVWe work with tree rings.
p349
aVAnd that's how we discover
p350
aVwhat is truly natural
p351
aVand how different is the last century, right?
p352
aVAnd I chose this one
p353
aVbecause it's complicated and messy looking, right.
p354
aVThis is as messy as it gets.
p355
aVYou can see there's some signals there.
p356
aVSome of the records
p357
aVshow lower temperatures than others.
p358
aVSome of them show greater variability.
p359
aVBut they all tell us
p360
aVwhat the natural variability is.
p361
aVSome of them are from the northern hemisphere;
p362
aVsome are from the entire globe.
p363
aa(lp364
VBut here's what we can say:
p365
aVwhat's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down.
p366
aVIt was cooling down
p367
aVuntil about 1900 or so.
p368
aVAnd there is natural variability
p369
aVcaused by the Sun, caused by El Ninos.
p370
aVA century-scale, decadal-scale variability,
p371
aVand we know the magnitude;
p372
aVit's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade.
p373
aVBut then at the very end is where
p374
aVwe have the instrumental record in black.
p375
aVAnd there's the temperature up there in 2009.
p376
aVYou know, we've warmed the globe
p377
aVabout a degree Centigrade in the last century,
p378
aVand there's nothing
p379
aVin the natural part of that record
p380
aVthat resembles what we've seen in the last century.
p381
aVYou know, that's the strength of our argument,
p382
aVthat we are doing something that's truly different.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo I'll close with a short discussion
p385
aVof ocean acidification.
p386
aVI like it as a component of global change to talk about,
p387
aVbecause, even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic,
p388
aVand I talk to that community fairly often,
p389
aVyou cannot deny
p390
aVthe simple physics
p391
aVof CO2 dissolving in the ocean.
p392
aVYou know, we're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere,
p393
aVfrom fossil fuels, from cement production.
p394
aVRight now, about a third of that carbon dioxide
p395
aVis dissolving straight into the sea, right?
p396
aVAnd as it does so,
p397
aVit makes the ocean more acidic.
p398
aVSo, you cannot argue with that.
p399
aVThat is what's happening right now,
p400
aVand it's a very different issue
p401
aVthan the global warming issue.
p402
aVIt has many consequences.
p403
aa(lp404
VThere's consequences for carbonate organisms.
p405
aVThere are many organisms
p406
aVthat build their shells out of calcium carbonate \u2014
p407
aVplants and animals both.
p408
aVThe main framework material of coral reefs
p409
aVis calcium carbonate.
p410
aVThat material is more soluble
p411
aVin acidic fluid.
p412
aVSo one of the things we're seeing
p413
aVis organisms are having
p414
aVto spend more metabolic energy
p415
aVto build and maintain their shells.
p416
aVAt some point, as this transience,
p417
aVas this CO2 uptake in the ocean continues,
p418
aVthat material's actually going to start to dissolve.
p419
aVAnd on coral reefs,
p420
aVwhere some of the main framework organisms disappear,
p421
aVwe will see a major loss
p422
aVof marine biodiversity.
p423
aVBut it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected.
p424
aVThere's many physiological processes
p425
aVthat are influenced by the acidity of the ocean.
p426
aVSo many reactions involving enzymes and proteins
p427
aVare sensitive to the acid content of the ocean.
p428
aVSo, all of these things \u2014
p429
aVgreater metabolic demands,
p430
aVreduced reproductive success,
p431
aVchanges in respiration and metabolism.
p432
aVYou know, these are things that we have good physiological reasons
p433
aVto expect to see stressed
p434
aVcaused by this transience.
p435
aa(lp436
VSo we figured out some pretty interesting ways
p437
aVto track CO2 levels in the atmosphere,
p438
aVgoing back millions of years.
p439
aVWe used to do it just with ice cores,
p440
aVbut in this case, we're going back 20 million years.
p441
aVAnd we take samples of the sediment,
p442
aVand it tells us the CO2 level of the ocean,
p443
aVand therefore the CO2 level of the atmosphere.
p444
aVAnd here's the thing:
p445
aVyou have to go back about 15 million years
p446
aVto find a time when CO2 levels
p447
aVwere about what they are today.
p448
aVYou have to go back about 30 million years
p449
aVto find a time when CO2 levels
p450
aVwere double what they are today.
p451
aVNow, what that means is
p452
aVthat all of the organisms that live in the sea
p453
aVhave evolved in this chemostatted ocean,
p454
aVwith CO2 levels lower than they are today.
p455
aVThat's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt
p456
aVto this rapid acidification
p457
aVthat's going on right now.

VSo, Charlie Veron
p460
aVcame up with this statement last year:
p461
aV"The prospect of ocean acidification
p462
aVmay well be the most serious
p463
aVof all of the predicted outcomes
p464
aVof anthropogenic CO2 release."
p465
aVAnd I think that may very well be true,
p466
aVso I'll close with this.
p467
aVYou know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely,
p468
aVbut for the sake of the oceans,
p469
aVwe have to cap or limit CO2 emissions
p470
aVas soon as possible.
p471
aa(lp472
VThank you very much.

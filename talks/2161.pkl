VI'm a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder,
p5
aVbut this is not how I started.
p6
aVWhen I was seven years old, I remember watching television
p7
aVand seeing people throwing rocks,
p8
aVand thinking, this must be a fun thing to do.
p9
aVSo I got out to the street and threw rocks,
p10
aVnot realizing I was supposed to throw rocks at Israeli cars.
p11
aVInstead, I ended up stoning my neighbors' cars. (Laughter)
p12
aVThey were not enthusiastic about my patriotism.
p13
aa(lp14
VThis is my picture with my brother.
p15
aVThis is me, the little one, and I know what you're thinking:
p16
aV"You used to look cute, what the heck happened to you?"
p17
aVBut my brother, who is older than me,
p18
aVwas arrested when he was 18,
p19
aVtaken to prison on charges of throwing stones.
p20
aVHe was beaten up when he refused to confess that he threw stones,
p21
aVand as a result, had internal injuries
p22
aVthat caused his death soon after he was released from prison.
p23
aa(lp24
VI was angry, I was bitter,
p25
aVand all I wanted was revenge.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut that changed when I was 18.
p28
aVI decided that I needed Hebrew to get a job,
p29
aVand going to study Hebrew in that classroom
p30
aVwas the first time I ever met Jews who were not soldiers.
p31
aVAnd we connected over really small things, like the fact that I love country music,
p32
aVwhich is really strange for Palestinians.
p33
aVBut it was then that I realized also that we have a wall of anger,
p34
aVof hatred and of ignorance that separates us.
p35
aVI decided that it doesn't matter what happens to me.
p36
aVWhat really matters is how I deal with it.
p37
aVAnd therefore, I decided to dedicate my life
p38
aVto bringing down the walls that separate people.
p39
aa(lp40
VI do so through many ways.
p41
aVTourism is one of them, but also media and education,
p42
aVand you might be wondering, really, can tourism change things?
p43
aVCan it bring down walls? Yes.
p44
aVTourism is the best sustainable way to bring down those walls
p45
aVand to create a sustainable way of connecting with each other
p46
aVand creating friendships.
p47
aa(lp48
VIn 2009, I cofounded Mejdi Tours,
p49
aVa social enterprise that aims to connect people,
p50
aVwith two Jewish friends, by the way,
p51
aVand what we'll do, the model we did,
p52
aVfor example, in Jerusalem, we would have two tour guides,
p53
aVone Israeli and one Palestinian, guiding the trips together,
p54
aVtelling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict
p55
aVfrom totally different perspectives.
p56
aVI remember running a trip together with a friend named Kobi \u2014
p57
aVJewish congregation from Chicago, the trip was in Jerusalem \u2014
p58
aVand we took them to a refugee camp, a Palestinian refugee camp,
p59
aVand there we had this amazing food.
p60
aVBy the way, this is my mother. She's cool.
p61
aVAnd that's the Palestinian food called maqluba.
p62
aVIt means "upside-down."
p63
aVYou cook it with rice and chicken, and you flip it upside-down.
p64
aVIt's the best meal ever.
p65
aVAnd we'll eat together.
p66
aVThen we had a joint band, Israeli and Palestinian musicians,
p67
aVand we did some belly-dancing.
p68
aVIf you don't know any, I'll teach you later.
p69
aVBut when we left, both sides,
p70
aVthey were crying because they did not want to leave.
p71
aVThree years later, those relationships still exist.
p72
aa(lp73
VImagine with me if the one billion people
p74
aVwho travel internationally  every year travel like this,
p75
aVnot being taken in the bus from one side to another,
p76
aVfrom one hotel to another,
p77
aVtaking pictures from the windows of their buses of people and cultures,
p78
aVbut actually connecting with people.
p79
aa(lp80
VYou know, I remember having a Muslim group from the U.K.
p81
aVgoing to the house of an Orthodox Jewish family,
p82
aVand having their first Friday night dinners, that Sabbath dinner,
p83
aVand eating together hamin, which is a Jewish food, a stew,
p84
aVjust having the connection of realizing, after a while,
p85
aVthat a hundred years ago, their families came out
p86
aVof the same place in Northern Africa.
p87
aVThis is not a photo profile for your Facebook.
p88
aVThis is not disaster tourism.
p89
aVThis is the future of travel,
p90
aVand I invite you to join me to do that, to change your travel.
p91
aVWe're doing it all over the world now,
p92
aVfrom Ireland to Iran to Turkey,
p93
aVand we see ourselves going everywhere to change the world.
p94
aa(lp95
VThank you.

He was taken to prison and beaten &mdash; and died of his injuries. Sarah grew up angry, bitter and wanting revenge. But when later in life he met, for the first time, Jews who were not soldiers, Sarah had an epiphany: Not only did they share his love of small things, namely country music, but coming face to face with the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; compelled him to find ways to overcome hatred, anger and fear.</p><p>Sarah founded <a href=\\"http://www.mejditours.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MEJDI Tours</a>  to send tourists to Jerusalem with two guides, one Jewish and one Palestinian, each offering a different history and narrative of the city. Sarah tells success stories of tourists from the US visiting a Palestinian refugee camp and listening to joint Arab and Jewish bands play music, and of a Muslim family from the UK sharing Sabbath dinner with a Jewish family and realizing that 100 years ago, their people came from the same town in Northern Africa. MEJDI is expanding its service to Iran, Turkey, Ireland and other regions suffering from cultural conflict. If more of the world&rsquo;s 1 billion tourists were to engage with real people living real lives, argues Sarah, it would be a powerful force for shattering sterotypes and promoting understanding, friendship and peace.</p>", "slug": "aziz_abu_sarah", "whotheyare": "Aziz Abu Sarah helps people break down cultural and historical barriers through tourism.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 1823, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/ff02218ac6acc05a6f2764de0225deea00459777_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "For more tolerance, we need more ... tourism?", "take_action": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "link_url": "http://www.mejditours.com/get-started/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "verb": "visit", "published": true, "visible_url": "mejditours.com", "type": "take_action", "blurb": "**Attend** your own tour with Aziz Abu Sarah \\u2014 expand your horizons and spread tolerance about other cultures."}], "comments": 26780, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "How I learned to forgive my brother\'s murderers", "link_url": "http://ideas.ted.com/how-i-learned-to-forgive-my-brothers-murderers/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "https://tedideas.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/aziz_abu_sarah_hannabarczyk_ted_peaceactivism_finalart.jpg", "published": true, "visible_url": "ideas.ted.com", "type": "from_the_blog", "blurb": "Aziz Abu Sarah explains how he recovered from the murder of his brother and learned how peace and love can be potent tools of activism."}], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/66e05f11ebb6e55ade0d36d1bb785ca5c58c4dd4_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Aziz Abu Sarah is a Palestinian activist with an unusual approach to peace-keeping: Be a tourist.

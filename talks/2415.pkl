VImagine you're in Rome,
p5
aVand you've made your way to the Vatican Museums.
p6
aVAnd you've been shuffling down long corridors,
p7
aVpast statues, frescoes, lots and lots of stuff.
p8
aVYou're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.
p9
aVAt last \u2014 a long corridor, a stair and a door.
p10
aVYou're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo what are you expecting?
p13
aVSoaring domes? Choirs of angels?
p14
aVWe don't really have any of that there.
p15
aVInstead, you may ask yourself, what do we have?
p16
aa(lp17
VWell, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.
p18
aVAnd I mean literally, you're surrounded by painted curtains,
p19
aVthe original decoration of this chapel.
p20
aVChurches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses,
p21
aVbut as a way to represent the great theater of life.
p22
aVThe human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story,
p23
aVa story that encompasses the whole world
p24
aVand that came to unfold in the three stages
p25
aVof the painting in the Sistine Chapel.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, this building started out as a space for a small group
p28
aVof wealthy, educated Christian priests.
p29
aVThey prayed there. They elected their pope there.
p30
aVFive hundred years ago,
p31
aVit was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave.
p32
aVSo, you may ask, how can it be that today it attracts and delights
p33
aVfive million people a year,
p34
aVfrom all different backgrounds?
p35
aVBecause in that compressed space, there was a creative explosion,
p36
aVignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers,
p37
aVwhich set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church
p38
aVand produced one of the greatest works of art in history.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, this development took place as a great evolution,
p41
aVmoving from the beginning of a few elite,
p42
aVand eventually able to speak to audiences of people
p43
aVthat come from all over the world.
p44
aVThis evolution took place in three stages,
p45
aVeach one linked to a historical circumstance.
p46
aVThe first one was rather limited in scope.
p47
aVIt reflected the rather parochial perspective.
p48
aVThe second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered
p49
aVafter Columbus's historical voyage;
p50
aVand the third,
p51
aVwhen the Age of Discovery was well under way
p52
aVand the Church rose to the challenge
p53
aVof going global.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world.
p56
aVThere were busy scenes
p57
aVthat told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses,
p58
aVreflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people.
p59
aVThe man who commissioned this, Pope Sixtus IV,
p60
aVassembled a dream team of Florentine art,
p61
aVincluding men like Sandro Botticelli
p62
aVand the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher,
p63
aVGhirlandaio.
p64
aVThese men, they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color,
p65
aVand in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes,
p66
aVthe artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape
p67
aVto render a faraway story, something much more familiar.
p68
aVWith the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family,
p69
aVthis was a perfect decoration for a small court
p70
aVlimited to the European continent.
p71
aVBut in 1492, the New World was discovered,
p72
aVhorizons were expanding,
p73
aVand this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well.
p74
aVAnd it did,
p75
aVthanks to a creative genius,
p76
aVa visionary and an awesome story.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti,
p79
aV33 years old when he was tapped to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,
p80
aVand the deck was stacked against him \u2014
p81
aVhe had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture.
p82
aVThere were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack
p83
aVof incomplete commissions,
p84
aVlured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project,
p85
aVand that project had fallen through.
p86
aVAnd he had been left with a commission to paint 12 apostles
p87
aVagainst a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling,
p88
aVwhich would look like every other ceiling in Italy.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut genius rose to the challenge.
p91
aVIn an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean,
p92
aVMichelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters.
p93
aVHe, too, would tell a story \u2014
p94
aVno Apostles \u2014 but a story of great beginnings,
p95
aVthe story of Genesis.
p96
aa(lp97
VNot really an easy sell, stories on a ceiling.
p98
aVHow would you be able to read a busy scene from 62 feet below?
p99
aVThe painting technique that had been handed on for 200 years
p100
aVin Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,
p103
aVand so he played to his strengths.
p104
aVInstead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness,
p105
aVhe took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble
p106
aVto reveal the figure within.
p107
aVMichelangelo was an essentialist;
p108
aVhe would tell his story in massive, dynamic bodies.
p109
aa(lp110
VThis plan was embraced by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,
p111
aVa man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius.
p112
aVHe was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,
p113
aVand he had been steeped in art for 30 years and he knew its power.
p114
aVAnd history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope,
p115
aVbut this man's legacy to the Vatican \u2014 it wasn't fortresses and artillery,
p116
aVit was art.
p117
aVHe left us the Raphael Rooms, the Sistine Chapel.
p118
aVHe left St. Peter's Basilica
p119
aVas well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures \u2014
p120
aVdecidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed
p121
aVof the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums.
p122
aVJulius was a man
p123
aVwho envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant
p124
aVthrough grandeur and through beauty,
p125
aVand he was right.
p126
aVThe encounter between these two giants, Michelangelo and Julius II,
p127
aVthat's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.
p128
aVMichelangelo was so committed to this project,
p129
aVthat he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years,
p130
aVusing a skeleton crew and spending most of the time, hours on end,
p131
aVreaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo let's look at this ceiling
p134
aVand see storytelling gone global.
p135
aVNo more familiar artistic references to the world around you.
p136
aVThere's just space and structure and energy;
p137
aVa monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels,
p138
aVmore driven by sculptural form than painterly color.
p139
aVAnd we stand in the far end by the entrance,
p140
aVfar from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy
p141
aVand we peer into the distance, looking for a beginning.
p142
aVAnd whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition,
p143
aVwe think in terms of a primal spark.
p144
aVMichelangelo gave us an initial energy
p145
aVwhen he gave us the separation of light and dark,
p146
aVa churning figure blurry in the distance,
p147
aVcompressed into a tight space.
p148
aVThe next figure looms larger,
p149
aVand you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next.
p150
aVHe leaves in his wake the sun, the moon, vegetation.
p151
aVMichelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created,
p152
aVunlike all the other artists.
p153
aVHe focused on the act of creation.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry
p156
aVand the creator hovers.
p157
aVSo what's he doing?
p158
aVIs he creating land? Is he creating sea?
p159
aVOr is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures,
p160
aVjust like Michelangelo must have,
p161
aVlooking back over his work in the ceiling
p162
aVand proclaiming, "It is good."
p163
aa(lp164
VSo now the scene is set,
p165
aVand you get to the culmination of creation, which is man.
p166
aVAdam leaps to the eye, a light figure against a dark background.
p167
aVBut looking closer,
p168
aVthat leg is pretty languid on the ground,
p169
aVthe arm is heavy on the knee.
p170
aVAdam lacks that interior spark
p171
aVthat will impel him to greatness.
p172
aVThat spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger,
p173
aVwhich is one millimeter from the hand of Adam.
p174
aVIt puts us at the edge of our seats,
p175
aVbecause we're one moment from that contact,
p176
aVthrough which that man will discover his purpose,
p177
aVleap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd then Michelangelo threw a curveball.
p180
aVWho is in that other arm?
p181
aVEve, first woman.
p182
aVNo, she's not an afterthought. She's part of the plan.
p183
aVShe's always been in his mind.
p184
aVLook at her, so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm.
p185
aVAnd for me, an American art historian from the 21st century,
p186
aVthis was the moment that the painting spoke to me.
p187
aVBecause I realized that this representation of the human drama
p188
aVwas always about men and women \u2014
p189
aVso much so, that the dead center, the heart of the ceiling,
p190
aVis the creation of woman, not Adam.
p191
aVAnd the fact is, that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden,
p192
aVthey fall together
p193
aVand together their proud posture turns into folded shame.
p194
aa(lp195
VYou are at critical juncture now in the ceiling.
p196
aVYou are exactly at the point where you and I can go
p197
aVno further into the church.
p198
aVThe gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum,
p199
aVand we are cast out much like Adam and Eve.
p200
aVThe remaining scenes in the ceiling,
p201
aVthey mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us.
p202
aVYou have Noah and his Ark and the flood.
p203
aVYou have Noah. He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God.
p204
aVMaybe he's the savior.
p205
aVOh, but no, Noah is the one who grew grapes, invented wine,
p206
aVgot drunk and passed out naked in his barn.
p207
aVIt is a curious way to design the ceiling,
p208
aVnow starting out with God creating life,
p209
aVending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn.
p210
aVAnd so, compared with Adam,
p211
aVyou might think Michelangelo is making fun of us.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut he's about to dispel the gloom
p214
aVby using those bright colors right underneath Noah:
p215
aVemerald, topaz, scarlet on the prophet Zechariah.
p216
aVZechariah foresees a light coming from the east,
p217
aVand we are turned at this juncture to a new destination,
p218
aVwith sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade.
p219
aVYou have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way,
p220
aVand we follow the mothers and fathers.
p221
aVThey are the motors of this great human engine, driving it forward.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd now we're at the keystone of the ceiling,
p224
aVthe culmination of the whole thing,
p225
aVwith a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space
p226
aVinto our space,
p227
aVencroaching our space.
p228
aa(lp229
VThis is the most important juncture.
p230
aVPast meets present.
p231
aVThis figure, Jonah, who spent three days in the belly of the whale,
p232
aVfor the Christians, is the symbol of the renewal of humanity
p233
aVthrough Jesus' sacrifice,
p234
aVbut for the multitudes of visitors to that museum
p235
aVfrom all faiths who visit there every day,
p236
aVhe is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality.
p237
aa(lp238
VAll of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall,
p239
aVwhere we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment,
p240
aVpainted in 1534 after the world had changed again.
p241
aVThe Reformation had splintered the Church,
p242
aVthe Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word
p243
aVand Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean.
p244
aVHow is a 59-year-old artist who has never been any further than Venice
p245
aVgoing to speak to this new world?
p246
aVMichelangelo chose to paint destiny,
p247
aVthat universal desire,
p248
aVcommon to all of us,
p249
aVto leave a legacy of excellence.
p250
aVTold in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment,
p251
aVthe end of the world,
p252
aVMichelangelo gave you a series of figures
p253
aVwho are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies.
p254
aVThey have no more covers, no more portraits
p255
aVexcept for a couple.
p256
aVIt's a composition only out of bodies,
p257
aV391, no two alike,
p258
aVunique like each and every one of us.
p259
aVThey start in the lower corner, breaking away from the ground,
p260
aVstruggling and trying to rise.
p261
aVThose who have risen reach back to help others,
p262
aVand in one amazing vignette,
p263
aVyou have a black man and a white man pulled up together
p264
aVin an incredible vision of human unity
p265
aVin this new world.
p266
aVThe lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle.
p267
aVThere you find men and women completely nude like athletes.
p268
aVThey are the ones who have overcome adversity,
p269
aVand Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity,
p270
aVovercome obstacles \u2014
p271
aVthey're just like athletes.
p272
aVSo you have men and women flexing and posing
p273
aVin this extraordinary spotlight.
p274
aVPresiding over this assembly is Jesus,
p275
aVfirst a suffering man on the cross,
p276
aVnow a glorious ruler in Heaven.
p277
aVAnd as Michelangelo proved in his painting,
p278
aVhardship, setbacks and obstacles,
p279
aVthey don't limit excellence, they forge it.
p280
aa(lp281
VNow, this does lead us to one odd thing.
p282
aVThis is the Pope's private chapel,
p283
aVand the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes.
p284
aVBut Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language,
p285
aVthe most universal artistic language he could think of:
p286
aVthat of the human body.
p287
aVAnd so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,
p288
aVhe borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures
p289
aVin order to show inner strength as external power.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow, one contemporary did write
p292
aVthat the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy.
p293
aVAnd so it did.
p294
aVMichelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press,
p295
aVcomplaints about the nudity spread all over the place,
p296
aVand soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography,
p297
aVat which point he added two more portraits,
p298
aVone of the man who criticized him, a papal courtier,
p299
aVand the other one of himself as a dried up husk, no athlete,
p300
aVin the hands of a long-suffering martyr.
p301
aVThe year he died he saw several of these figures covered over,
p302
aVa triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory.
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd so now we stand
p305
aVin the here and now.
p306
aVWe are caught in that space
p307
aVbetween beginnings and endings,
p308
aVin the great, huge totality of the human experience.
p309
aVThe Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror.
p310
aVWho am I in this picture?
p311
aVAm I one of the crowd?
p312
aVAm I the drunk guy?
p313
aVAm I the athlete?
p314
aVAnd as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty,
p315
aVwe are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions:
p316
aVWho am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?
p317
aa(lp318
VThank you.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Applause)
p321
aa(lp322
VBruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.
p323
aa(lp324
VElizabeth, you mentioned this whole issue of pornography,
p325
aVtoo many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things
p326
aVin the eyes of the time.
p327
aVBut actually the story is bigger.
p328
aVIt's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures.
p329
aVThis work of art was almost destroyed because of that.
p330
aa(lp331
VElizabeth Lev: The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous.
p332
aVThe printing press made sure that everybody saw it.
p333
aVAnd so, this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks.
p334
aVIt was something that happened over the space of 20 years
p335
aVof editorials and complaints,
p336
aVsaying to the Church,
p337
aV"You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives.
p338
aVDid you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?"
p339
aVAnd so after complaints and insistence
p340
aVof trying to get this work destroyed,
p341
aVit was finally the year that Michelangelo died
p342
aVthat the Church finally found a compromise,
p343
aVa way to save the painting,
p344
aVand that was in putting up these extra 30 covers,
p345
aVand that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing.
p346
aVThat's where it all came about,
p347
aVand it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art,
p348
aVnot indeed deface or destroyed it.
p349
aa(lp350
VBG: This, what you just gave us, is not the classic tour
p351
aVthat people get today when they go to the Sistine Chapel.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VEL: I don't know, is that an ad?
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VBG: No, no, no, not necessarily, it is a statement.
p360
aVThe experience of art today is encountering problems.
p361
aVToo many people want to see this there,
p362
aVand the result is five million people going through that tiny door
p363
aVand experiencing it in a completely different way
p364
aVthan we just did.
p365
aa(lp366
VEL: Right. I agree. I think it's really nice to be able to pause and look.
p367
aVBut also realize, even when you're in those days,
p368
aVwith 28,000 people a day,
p369
aVeven those days when you're in there with all those other people,
p370
aVlook around you and think how amazing it is
p371
aVthat some painted plaster from 500 years ago
p372
aVcan still draw all those people standing side by side with you,
p373
aVlooking upwards with their jaws dropped.
p374
aVIt's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all
p375
aVthrough time and through geographic space.
p376
aa(lp377
VBG: Liz, grazie.
p378
aa(lp379
VEL: Grazie a te.
p380
aa(lp381
VBG: Thank you.

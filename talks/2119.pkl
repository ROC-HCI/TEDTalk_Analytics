VI came here to show you
p5
aVthe Fotokite.
p6
aVIt's a tethered, flying camera.
p7
aVBut before I do that, I want to tell you a bit about
p8
aVwhere it came from, what motivated it.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo I was born in Russia,
p11
aVand three years ago, in 2011,
p12
aVthere were the Russian federal elections.
p13
aVThere were massive irregularities reported,
p14
aVand people came out to protest,
p15
aVwhich was very unlikely for Russia.
p16
aVAnd no one really knew
p17
aVhow significant these protests were,
p18
aVbecause, for whatever reason,
p19
aVthe world media largely ignored it.
p20
aVNow, there was a group of photographers
p21
aVwho kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby \u2014
p22
aVusually photographing things like the Sphinx,
p23
aVthe Pyramids \u2014 who happened to be
p24
aVright around the corner, and they flew a camera
p25
aVand they took some snapshots,
p26
aVsome panoramas of this demonstration.
p27
aVJust completely independent entity,
p28
aVcompletely random occurrence,
p29
aVand the image, when I saw it, it really struck me.
p30
aVHere's one of the panoramas.
p31
aVSo in a single image,
p32
aVyou can really see the scale of this event \u2014
p33
aVjust the number of people,
p34
aVthe colors, the banners.
p35
aVYou just can't consider this insignificant.
p36
aVAll in a single image, which was really cool to me.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd I think, in the future,
p39
aVjournalism and many other professions,
p40
aVthere are flying cameras already quite commonly out there,
p41
aVbut I think, you wait a few months, a few years,
p42
aVand for many professions, it's really going to be
p43
aVa requirement.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd it make sense. It's  such a unique perspective.
p46
aVNothing really communicates  this scale, for example,
p47
aVin context, in a way that this does.
p48
aVBut there are a few hurdles,  and they are quite basic
p49
aVand quite fundamental.
p50
aa(lp51
VOne is piloting.
p52
aVSo for this image, they flew a camera,
p53
aVa five kilogram device with an SLR under it.
p54
aVIt's quite heavy, lots of  spinning, sharp things.
p55
aVIt's a bit uncomfortable to fly,
p56
aVprobably also for the operator.
p57
aVIn fact, you can see that on the  back of the pilot's shirt, it says,
p58
aV"No questions until landing"
p59
aVin Russian and in English,
p60
aVbecause people are curious, and they'll go tap you,
p61
aVand then you lose your focus and things happen.
p62
aVAnd these guys are great. They're professionals;
p63
aVthey're really careful in what they do.
p64
aVSo in the protests, maybe you noticed,
p65
aVthey flew over the river so it was quite safe.
p66
aVBut this doesn't necessarily apply to
p67
aVall people and all conditions,
p68
aVso we really have to make piloting easier.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe other problem is regulations,
p71
aVor rather, the lack of good regulation.
p72
aVFor many good reasons, it's just difficult
p73
aVto come up with common sense laws
p74
aVto regulate flying cameras.
p75
aVSo we already have cameras.
p76
aVEveryone here, I'm sure, has a smartphone with a camera, right?
p77
aVThere are more and more of them.
p78
aVYou hear about people with Google Glass being attacked.
p79
aVYou hear about, actually, a drone pilot,
p80
aVa hobbyist, was attacked two weeks ago
p81
aVbecause he was flying near a beach.
p82
aVHere's some personal input I didn't expect.
p83
aVJust yesterday, I was attacked by a guy
p84
aVwho claimed that I was filming him.
p85
aVI was checking my email right here \u2014
p86
aVeasy way to get input for your talk.
p87
aVBut I think there are better solutions.
p88
aVI think we have to defuse the situation.
p89
aVWe have to come up with responsible solutions
p90
aVthat address the privacy issues
p91
aVand the safety, accountability issues
p92
aVbut still give us that perspective.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd this is one potential solution.
p95
aVSo this is the Fotokite.
p96
aVWell, let me see, it's a quadrocopter,
p97
aVbut what's kind of special  about it is there's a leash.
p98
aVIt's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient.
p99
aVAnd the neat thing about it is,
p100
aVto fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this.
p101
aVYou just turn it on
p102
aVand you point in the direction that you want to fly.
p103
aVYou give it a little twist.
p104
aVThat's kind of the way you communicate.
p105
aVAnd there it goes.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Applause)
p108
aa(lp109
VSo the interaction is super simple.
p110
aVIt's like a personal flying pet.
p111
aVIt just always maintains a certain angle to you,
p112
aVand if I move around with it,
p113
aVit'll actually follow me naturally.
p114
aVAnd of course, we can build on top of this.
p115
aVSo this leash has some additional electronics.
p116
aVYou can turn it on.
p117
aVAnd now, it's like telling your dog to fly lower,
p118
aVif you have such a dog. So, I can press a button
p119
aVand manipulate it rather easily.
p120
aVSo I just shifted its position.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd it's really safe.
p123
aVI don't know about you guys in the front row \u2014
p124
aV(Laughter) \u2014 but at least in principle,
p125
aVyou have to agree that you feel safer
p126
aVbecause there is a physical connection.
p127
aVLive demos are hard, right?
p128
aVThings go wrong all the time.
p129
aVBut no matter what,
p130
aVthis thing will actually prevent this thing
p131
aVfrom going into you.
p132
aVWhat's more, it tells you immediately that
p133
aVI am the one responsible for this device.
p134
aVYou don't have to look for someone controlling it.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, I can tell you that it's easy a lot,
p137
aVbut I think a really good way to prove that
p138
aVis to grab a second one
p139
aVand launch it.
p140
aVAnd if I can do this on stage live,
p141
aVthen I can show each and every one of you
p142
aVin five minutes how to  operate one of these devices.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo now we have two eyes in the sky. (Applause)
p145
aVAnd now the trick is getting them back.
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VSo my question now to you is,
p149
aVwell, it's a nice solution,
p150
aVit's very accessible, it's safe.
p151
aVWhat would you use it for?
p152
aVWhat would you use such a camera for in your life?
p153
aa(lp154
VThank you.

an aerial photograph of massive protests around the 2011 Russian federal elections changed the media silence around the subject, the aerial robotics engineer realized the truth-telling value of the bird&rsquo;s-eye view. Yet aerial photographs, even those taken by unmanned aerial vehicles, are tricky to produce: it&rsquo;s difficult to pilot a UAV safely, and government regulations restrict their use. </p><p>Lupashin gets around both obstacles with his new invention, the Fotokite &ndash; a lightweight, camera-equipped quadricopter controlled with a tether (for the purposes of this demo, a dog leash). He turns one on, points it in a direction, and it flies out, hovering at a consistent angle. Then he launches a second, and a third. While the Fotokite would have a huge impact on journalism, it should also prove useful for archeologists, architects, wildlife biologists, emergency responders and more. The possibilities are endless. If you had one, Lupashin asks, what would you do with it?</p>", "slug": "sergei_lupashin", "whotheyare": "Sergei Lupashin imagines new uses for flying robots.

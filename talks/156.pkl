VLike many of you here, I am trying to contribute
p5
aVtowards a renaissance in Africa.
p6
aVThe question of transformation in Africa
p7
aVreally is a question of leadership.
p8
aVAfrica can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.
p9
aVAnd it is my contention that the manner in which
p10
aVwe educate our leaders is fundamental
p11
aVto progress on this continent.
p12
aVI want to tell you some stories that explain my view.
p13
aVWe all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.
p14
aVAn American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana,
p15
aVand in a period of three months she came to a conclusion
p16
aVabout the state of leadership in Africa
p17
aVthat had taken me over a decade to reach.
p18
aVTwice she was involved in surgeries
p19
aVwhere they lost power at the hospital.
p20
aVThe emergency generators did not start.
p21
aVThere was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle \u2014
p22
aVpitch black.
p23
aVThe patient's cut open, twice.
p24
aVThe first time it was a C-section.
p25
aVThankfully, baby was out \u2014 mother and child survived.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
p28
aVAnesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain.
p29
aVHe's crying. He's screaming. He's praying.
p30
aVPitch black. Not a candle, not a flashlight.
p31
aVAnd that hospital could have afforded flashlights.
p32
aVThey could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't.
p33
aVAnd it happened twice.
p34
aVAnother time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die
p35
aVbecause they refused to give her oxygen that they had.
p36
aVAnd so three months later,
p37
aVjust before she returned to the United States,
p38
aVnurses in Accra go on strike.
p39
aVAnd her recommendation is
p40
aVtake this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again.
p41
aVStart all over again.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow what does this have to do with leadership?
p44
aVYou see, the folks at the ministry of health,
p45
aVthe hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses \u2014
p46
aVthey are among just five percent of their peers
p47
aVwho get an education after secondary school.
p48
aVThey are the elite. They are our leaders.
p49
aVTheir decisions, their actions matter.
p50
aVAnd when they fail, a nation literally suffers.
p51
aVSo when I speak of leadership,
p52
aVI'm not talking about just political leaders.
p53
aVWe've heard a lot about that.
p54
aVI'm talking about the elite.
p55
aVThose who've been trained,
p56
aVwhose job it is to be the guardians of their society.
p57
aVThe lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors,
p58
aVthe engineers, the civil servants \u2014
p59
aVthose are the leaders.
p60
aVAnd we need to train them right.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana
p63
aVoccurred when I was 16 years old.
p64
aVWe had just had a military coup,
p65
aVand soldiers were pervasive in our society.
p66
aVThey were a pervasive presence.
p67
aVAnd one day I go to the airport to meet my father,
p68
aVand as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park
p69
aVto the terminal building,
p70
aVI'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons.
p71
aVAnd they asked me to join a crowd of people
p72
aVthat were running up and down this embankment.
p73
aVWhy? Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds.
p74
aVNo sign to this effect.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, I was 16. I was very worried about
p77
aVwhat my peers at school might think
p78
aVif they saw me running up and down this hill.
p79
aVI was especially concerned of what the girls might think.
p80
aVAnd so I started to argue with these men.
p81
aVIt was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.
p82
aVI got lucky.
p83
aVA Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament.
p84
aVBecause of his uniform they speak to him differently,
p85
aVand they explain to him that they're just following orders.
p86
aVSo he takes their radio, talks to their boss,
p87
aVand gets us all released.
p88
aVWhat lessons would you take from an experience like this?
p89
aVSeveral, for me.
p90
aVLeadership matters. Those men are following
p91
aVthe orders of a superior officer.
p92
aVI learned something about courage.
p93
aVIt was important not to look at those guns.
p94
aVAnd I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VSo a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship
p99
aVto go to Swarthmore College for my education.
p100
aVIt was a breath of fresh air.
p101
aVYou know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information
p102
aVand repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana.
p103
aVThey wanted us to think critically.
p104
aVThey wanted us to be analytical.
p105
aVThey wanted us to be concerned about social issues.
p106
aVIn my economics classes I got high marks
p107
aVfor my understanding of basic economics.
p108
aVBut I learned something more profound than that,
p109
aVwhich is that the leaders \u2014 the managers of Ghana's economy \u2014
p110
aVwere making breathtakingly bad decisions
p111
aVthat had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.
p112
aVAnd so here was this lesson again \u2014 leadership matters.
p113
aVIt matters a great deal.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore.
p116
aVI had an inkling,
p117
aVbut I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace
p118
aVand I went to work at Microsoft Corporation.
p119
aVAnd I was part of this team \u2014 this thinking, learning team
p120
aVwhose job it was to design and implement new software
p121
aVthat created value in the world.
p122
aVAnd it was brilliant to be part of this team.
p123
aVIt was brilliant.
p124
aVAnd I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore,
p125
aVthis transformation \u2014
p126
aVthe ability to confront problems, complex problems,
p127
aVand to design solutions to those problems.
p128
aVThe ability to create is the most empowering thing
p129
aVthat can happen to an individual.
p130
aVAnd I was part of that.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company
p133
aVgrew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.
p134
aVAnd by the way, it's continued to.
p135
aVThe gap has widened since I left.
p136
aVNow, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.
p137
aVI mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking,
p138
aVpersistent, creative, empowered.
p139
aVBut there were also some external factors:
p140
aVfree markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.
p141
aVThese things were provided by institutions
p142
aVrun by the people that I call leaders.
p143
aVAnd those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.
p144
aVSomebody trained them to do the work that they do.
p145
aVNow, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened.
p146
aVI became a parent.
p147
aVAnd for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before.
p148
aVBecause I realized that the state of the African continent
p149
aVwould matter to my children and their children.
p150
aVThat the state of the world \u2014 the state of the world
p151
aVdepends on what's happening to Africa,
p152
aVas far as my kids would be concerned.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd at this time, when I was going through
p155
aVwhat I call my "pre-mid-life crisis,"
p156
aVAfrica was a mess.
p157
aVSomalia had disintegrated into anarchy.
p158
aVRwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.
p159
aVAnd it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction,
p160
aVand I needed to be back helping.
p161
aVI couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids
p162
aVin an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it.
p163
aVThis was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.
p164
aVSo I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did
p165
aVwas to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people
p166
aVand really try to understand what the real issues were.
p167
aVAnd three things kept coming up for every problem:
p168
aVcorruption, weak institutions
p169
aVand the people who run them \u2014 the leaders.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, I was a little scared
p172
aVbecause when you see those three problems,
p173
aVthey seem really hard to deal with.
p174
aVAnd they might say, "Look, don't even try."
p175
aVBut, for me, I asked the question,
p176
aV"Well, where are these leaders coming from?
p177
aVWhat is it about Ghana that produces leaders
p178
aVthat are unethical or unable to solve problems?"
p179
aVSo I went to look at what was happening in our educational system.
p180
aVAnd it was the same \u2014 learning by rote \u2014
p181
aVfrom primary school through graduate school.
p182
aVVery little emphasis on ethics,
p183
aVand the typical graduate
p184
aVfrom a university in Ghana has a stronger sense
p185
aVof entitlement than a sense of responsibility.
p186
aVThis is wrong.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo I decided to engage this particular problem.
p189
aVBecause it seems to me that every society, every society,
p190
aVmust be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.
p191
aVAnd Ghana was not paying enough attention.
p192
aVAnd this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually.
p193
aVSo this is what I'm doing now.
p194
aVI'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.
p195
aVI wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country.
p196
aVI think it would make a huge difference.
p197
aVAnd what Ashesi University is trying to do
p198
aVis to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders.
p199
aVWe're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity,
p200
aVwho have the ability to confront the complex problems,
p201
aVask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions.
p202
aa(lp203
VI'll admit that there are times when it seems like "Mission: Impossible,"
p204
aVbut we must believe that these kids are smart.
p205
aVThat if we involve them in their education,
p206
aVif we have them discuss the real issues that they confront \u2014
p207
aVthat our whole society confronts \u2014
p208
aVand if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world,
p209
aVthat magic will happen.
p210
aVNow, a month into this project, we'd just started classes.
p211
aVAnd a month into it, I come to the office,
p212
aVand I have this email from one of our students.
p213
aVAnd it said, very simply, "I am thinking now."
p214
aVAnd he signs off, "Thank you."
p215
aVIt's such a simple statement.
p216
aVBut I was moved almost to tears
p217
aVbecause I understood what was happening to this young man.
p218
aVAnd it is an awesome thing to be a part
p219
aVof empowering someone in this way.
p220
aVI am thinking now.
p221
aa(lp222
VThis year we challenged our students
p223
aVto craft an honor code themselves.
p224
aVThere's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now
p225
aVover whether they should have an honor code,
p226
aVand if so, what it should look like.
p227
aVOne of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.
p228
aVCan we create a perfect society?
p229
aVHer understanding that a student-crafted honor code
p230
aVconstitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.
p231
aVNow, we cannot achieve perfection,
p232
aVbut if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.
p233
aVI don't know ultimately what they will do.
p234
aVI don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code.
p235
aVBut the conversation they're having now \u2014
p236
aVabout what their good society should look like,
p237
aVwhat their excellent society should look like,
p238
aVis a really good thing.
p239
aa(lp240
VAm I out of time? OK.
p241
aVNow, I just wanted to leave that slide up
p242
aVbecause it's important that we think about it.
p243
aVI'm very excited about the fact
p244
aVthat every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate.
p245
aVThat for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience.
p246
aVThese young future leaders are beginning to understand
p247
aVthe real business of leadership,
p248
aVthe real privilege of leadership,
p249
aVwhich is after all to serve humanity.
p250
aVI am even more thrilled by the fact that least year
p251
aVour student body elected a woman
p252
aVto be the head of Student Government.
p253
aVIt's the first time in the history of Ghana
p254
aVthat a woman has been elected head of Student Government
p255
aVat any university.
p256
aVIt says a lot about her.
p257
aVIt says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus.
p258
aVIt says a lot about her peers who elected her.
p259
aVShe won with 75 percent of the vote.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd it gives me a lot of hope.
p262
aVIt turns out that corporate West Africa
p263
aValso appreciates what's happening with our students.
p264
aVWe've graduated two classes of students to date.
p265
aVAnd every single one of them has been placed.
p266
aVAnd we're getting great reports back
p267
aVfrom corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa,
p268
aVand the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic.
p269
aVYou know, that passion for what they're doing.
p270
aVThe persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity,
p271
aVtheir ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before.
p272
aVThis is good because
p273
aVover the past five years, there have been times
p274
aVwhen I've felt this is "Mission: Impossible."
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd it's just wonderful to see these glimmers
p277
aVof the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right.
p278
aVI think that the current and future leaders of Africa
p279
aVhave an incredible opportunity
p280
aVto drive a major renaissance on the continent.
p281
aVIt's an incredible opportunity.
p282
aVThere aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.
p283
aVI believe that Africa has reached an inflection point
p284
aVwith a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.
p285
aVWe have reached a moment from which can emerge
p286
aVa great society within one generation.
p287
aVIt will depend on inspired leadership.
p288
aVAnd it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders
p289
aVwill make all the difference.
p290
aVThank you, and God bless.

VWhat we're really here to talk about is the "how."
p5
aVOkay, so how exactly do we create this
p6
aVworld-shattering, if you will, innovation?
p7
aVNow, I want to tell you a quick story.
p8
aVWe'll go back a little more than a year.
p9
aVIn fact, the date \u2014 I'm curious to know
p10
aVif any of you know what happened on this momentous date?
p11
aVIt was February 3rd, 2008.
p12
aVAnyone remember what happened,
p13
aVFebruary 3rd, 2008?
p14
aVSuper Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd the reason that this date was so momentous
p17
aVis that what my colleagues, John King
p18
aVand Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed
p19
aVas we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties,
p20
aVis that it seemed to us
p21
aVthat across the United States,
p22
aVif you will, tribal councils had convened.
p23
aVAnd they had discussed things of great national importance.
p24
aVLike, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"
p25
aVand, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"
p26
aVBut they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd if you go back in time to February 3rd,
p29
aVit looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.
p30
aVAnd there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.
p31
aVBut when we talked to people,
p32
aVit appeared that a funnel effect had happened
p33
aVin these tribes all across the United States.
p34
aVNow what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of
p35
aVabout 20 \u2014 so kind of more than a team \u2014
p36
aV20 to about 150 people.
p37
aVAnd it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.
p38
aVBut not just work. It's within these tribes
p39
aVthat societies get built,
p40
aVthat important things happen.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives
p43
aVfrom various tribal councils that met,
p44
aValso known as Super Bowl parties,
p45
aVwe sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.
p46
aVFebruary 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.
p47
aVWe said, "The tribes that we're in
p48
aVare saying it's going to be Obama."
p49
aVNow, the reason we knew that
p50
aVwas because we spent the previous 10 years
p51
aVstudying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.
p52
aa(lp53
VAll of you are members of tribes.
p54
aVIn walking around at the break,
p55
aVmany of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.
p56
aVAnd many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,
p57
aVwhich is to find someone
p58
aVwho is a member of a tribe,
p59
aVand to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,
p60
aVand make introductions.
p61
aVThat is in fact what great tribal leaders do.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo here is the bottom line.
p64
aVIf you focus in on a group like this \u2014
p65
aVthis happens to be a USC game \u2014
p66
aVand you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras
p67
aVand do magnification factors so you could see individual people,
p68
aVyou would in fact see not a single crowd,
p69
aVjust like there is not a single crowd here,
p70
aVbut you would see these tribes that are then coming together.
p71
aVAnd from a distance it appears that it's a single group.
p72
aVAnd so people form tribes.
p73
aVThey always have. They always will.
p74
aVJust as fish swim and birds fly,
p75
aVpeople form tribes. It's just what we do.
p76
aVBut here's the rub.
p77
aVNot all tribes are the same,
p78
aVand what makes the difference is the culture.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow here is the net out of this.
p81
aVYou're all a member of tribes.
p82
aVIf you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in
p83
aVand nudge them forward,
p84
aValong these tribal stages
p85
aVto what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.
p86
aVBut we're going to start with what we call Stage One.
p87
aVNow, this is the lowest of the stages.
p88
aVYou don't want this. Okay?
p89
aVThis is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.
p90
aVBut it's one that I think we need to learn from.
p91
aa(lp92
VStage One produces people
p93
aVwho do horrible things.
p94
aVThis is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.
p95
aVStage One is a group where people
p96
aVsystematically sever relationships from functional tribes,
p97
aVand then pool together
p98
aVwith people who think like they do.
p99
aVStage One is literally the culture of gangs
p100
aVand it is the culture of prisons.
p101
aVNow, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.
p102
aVAnd I want to make the point
p103
aVthat as members of society, we need to.
p104
aVIt's not enough to simply write people off.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut let's move on to Stage Two.
p107
aVNow, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."
p108
aVSo, this other book that Steve mentioned,
p109
aVthat just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance,"
p110
aVmy colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,
p111
aVargue that as people see the world, so they behave.
p112
aVWell, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,
p113
aVthen their behavior will follow automatically from that.
p114
aVIt will be despairing hostility.
p115
aVThey'll do whatever it takes to survive,
p116
aVeven if that means undermining other people.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, my birthday is coming up shortly,
p119
aVand my driver's license expires.
p120
aVAnd the reason that that's relevant is that very soon
p121
aVI will be walking into what we call
p122
aVa Stage Two tribe,
p123
aVwhich looks like this.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVNow, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles
p126
aVacross the land, you find a Stage Two culture?
p127
aVNo. But in the one near me,
p128
aVwhere I have to go in just a few days,
p129
aVwhat I will say when I'm standing in line is,
p130
aV"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?
p134
aVActually, no, I'm not.
p135
aVBut I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.
p136
aVSo in a Stage Two culture \u2014
p137
aVand we find these in all sorts of different places \u2014
p138
aVyou find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.
p139
aVYou find them in all places in society.
p140
aVI've come across them at the organizations
p141
aVthat everybody raves about as being best in class.
p142
aVBut here is the point. If you believe and you say
p143
aVto people in your tribe, in effect,
p144
aV"My life sucks.
p145
aVI mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC
p146
aVmy life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does."
p147
aVIf that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.
p148
aVWhat kind of innovation would get done?
p149
aVThe amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?
p150
aVIn fact it would be basically nil.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one
p153
aVthat hits closest to home for many of us.
p154
aVBecause it is in Stage Three that many of us move.
p155
aVAnd we park. And we stay.
p156
aVStage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aVI'm great and you're not.
p159
aVNow imagine having a whole room of people
p160
aVsaying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not."
p161
aVOr, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you
p162
aVand come out on top as a result of that."
p163
aVA whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.
p164
aa(lp165
VI know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.
p166
aVBut, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.
p167
aVI happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.
p168
aVAnd one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article
p169
aVin the New England Journal of Medicine?"
p170
aVAnd the other said, "No. That's great. Congratulations!"
p171
aa(lp172
VThe next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,
p173
aV"Well while you were, you know, doing your research," \u2014
p174
aVnotice the condescending tone \u2014
p175
aV"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries
p176
aVthan anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd the third one got the same wry smile and said,
p179
aV"Well, while you were off doing your research,
p180
aVand you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,
p181
aVthat eventually we'll train monkeys to do,
p182
aVor cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,
p183
aVI was off running the future of the residency program,
p184
aVwhich is really the future of medicine."
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.
p187
aVAnd the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.
p188
aVThat is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.
p189
aVNow, we find these in places
p190
aVwhere really smart, successful people show up.
p191
aVLike, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VHere is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.
p195
aVIt is moving from Stage Three
p196
aVto Stage Four.
p197
aVLet's take a look at a quick video snippet.
p198
aVThis is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.
p199
aVAnd my question on the other side is just going to be,
p200
aV"What do you think they value?"
p201
aVIt was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.
p202
aVThis is their lobby.
p203
aVEmployees volunteer time in the advice booth.
p204
aVNotice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.
p205
aa(lp206
VOkay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.
p207
aVThis is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.
p208
aVNotice people are applauding for us.
p209
aVThey don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did
p210
aVthey probably wouldn't applaud.
p211
aVBut you'll notice the level of excitement.
p212
aVNotice, again, how they decorate their office.
p213
aVNow, what's important to people at Zappos,
p214
aVthese may not be the things that are important to you.
p215
aVBut they value things like fun. And they value creativity.
p216
aVOne of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."
p217
aVAnd you'll notice they are a little bit weird.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo when individuals come together
p220
aVand find something that unites them
p221
aVthat's greater than their individual competence,
p222
aVthen something very important happens.
p223
aVThe group gels. And it changes
p224
aVfrom a group of highly motivated
p225
aVbut fairly individually-centric people
p226
aVinto something larger,
p227
aVinto a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.
p228
aVStage Four tribes can do remarkable things.
p229
aVBut you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.
p230
aVThere is, in fact, another stage.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.
p233
aVAnd if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great,"
p234
aVthis may seem a little incongruous.
p235
aVThis is a scene or snippet
p236
aVfrom the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa
p237
aVfor which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.
p238
aVNow think about that. South Africa,
p239
aVterrible atrocities had happened in the society.
p240
aVAnd people came together
p241
aVfocused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.
p242
aVThere was no road map. No one had ever done
p243
aVanything like this before.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd in this atmosphere, where the only guidance
p246
aVwas people's values and their noble cause,
p247
aVwhat this group accomplished was historic.
p248
aVAnd people, at the time, feared that South Africa
p249
aVwould end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,
p250
aVdescending into one skirmish after another
p251
aVin a civil war that seems to have no end.
p252
aVIn fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.
p253
aVLargely because people like Desmond Tutu
p254
aVset up a Stage Five process
p255
aVto involve the thousands and perhaps millions
p256
aVof tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.
p257
aVSo, people hear this and they conclude the following,
p258
aVas did we in doing the study.
p259
aa(lp260
VOkay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.
p261
aVThat's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way?
p262
aVI don't want to talk like they do
p263
aVat the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.
p264
aVI really don't want to just say "I'm great,"
p265
aVbecause that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.
p266
aVSaying, "We're great" \u2014 that sounds pretty good.
p267
aVBut I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."
p268
aa(lp269
VWell, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings
p270
aVthat come out of all this.
p271
aVThe first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence
p272
aVand actually read it,
p273
aVthe phrase that sticks in many of our minds
p274
aVis things about inalienable rights.
p275
aVI mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,
p276
aVoriented only by our values,
p277
aVno other guidance.
p278
aVIn fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.
p279
aV"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,
p280
aValso known as King George.
p281
aVWe're great! Who is not great? England!"
p282
aVSorry. (Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VWell, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?
p285
aVWhat about Martin Luther King?
p286
aVI mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right?
p287
aVJust one little bit of happiness and joy after another.
p288
aVIn fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.
p289
aVHe didn't say "We have a dream." He said, "I have a dream."
p290
aVWhy did he do that? Because most people
p291
aVare not at Stage Five.
p292
aa(lp293
VTwo percent are at Stage One.
p294
aVAbout 25 percent are at Stage Two,
p295
aVsaying, in effect, "My life sucks."
p296
aV48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,
p297
aVsay, "I'm great and you're not."
p298
aVAnd we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.
p299
aVOnly about 22 percent of tribes
p300
aVare at Stage Four,
p301
aVoriented by our values, saying "We're great.
p302
aVAnd our values are beginning to unite us."
p303
aVOnly two percent, only two percent of tribes
p304
aVget to Stage Five.
p305
aVAnd those are the ones that change the world.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo the first little finding from this
p308
aVis that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels
p309
aVso that you can touch every person in society.
p310
aVBut you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?
p311
aVTribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.
p312
aVSo we have to have the ability to talk
p313
aVall the levels, to go to where they are.
p314
aVAnd then leaders nudge people
p315
aVwithin their tribes to the next level.
p316
aVI'd like to show you some examples of this.
p317
aa(lp318
VOne of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,
p319
aVformer Mayor of San Francisco. Before that
p320
aVhe was Chief of Police in San Francisco.
p321
aVAnd he grew up essentially in Stage One.
p322
aVAnd you know what changed his life? It was walking into
p323
aVone of these, a Boys and Girls Club.
p324
aVNow here is what happened to this person
p325
aVwho eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.
p326
aVHe went from being alive and passionate
p327
aVat Stage One \u2014 remember, "Life sucks,
p328
aVdespairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" \u2014
p329
aVto walking into a Boys and Girls Club,
p330
aVfolding his arms, sitting down in a chair,
p331
aVand saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.
p332
aVI don't know anybody.
p333
aVI mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,
p334
aVthen my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.
p335
aVSo I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything."
p336
aa(lp337
VIn fact, that's progress.
p338
aVWe move people from Stage One to Stage Two
p339
aVby getting them in a new tribe
p340
aVand then, over time, getting them connected.
p341
aVSo, what about moving
p342
aVfrom Stage Three to Stage Four?
p343
aVI want to argue that we're doing that right here.
p344
aVTED represents a set of values,
p345
aVand as we unite around these values,
p346
aVsomething really interesting begins to emerge.
p347
aa(lp348
VIf you want this experience to live on
p349
aVas something historic,
p350
aVthen at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something
p351
aVbeyond what people normally do
p352
aVand call networking.
p353
aVWhich is not just to meet new people
p354
aVand extend your reach, extend your influence,
p355
aVbut instead, find someone you don't know,
p356
aVand find someone else you don't know,
p357
aVand introduce them.
p358
aVThat's called a triadic relationship.
p359
aa(lp360
VSee, people who build world-changing tribes do that.
p361
aVThey extend the reach of their tribes
p362
aVby connecting them, not just to myself,
p363
aVso that my following is greater,
p364
aVbut I connect people who don't know each other
p365
aVto something greater than themselves.
p366
aVAnd ultimately that adds to their values.
p367
aa(lp368
VBut we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,
p369
aVwhich is great, to Stage Five?
p370
aVThe story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of
p371
aVa place called the Gallup Organization.
p372
aVYou know they do polls, right?
p373
aVSo it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?
p374
aVPretty much everybody else who does polls.
p375
aVIf Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,
p376
aVpeople will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.
p377
aVSo, they were bored.
p378
aVThey wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.
p379
aa(lp380
V"How could we,
p381
aVinstead of just polling what Asia thinks
p382
aVor what the United States thinks,
p383
aVor who thinks what about Obama
p384
aVversus McCain or something like that,
p385
aVwhat does the entire world think?"
p386
aVAnd they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.
p387
aVThey had people involved who were Nobel laureates
p388
aVin economics, who reported being bored.
p389
aVAnd suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper
p390
aVand were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population
p391
aVof Sub-Saharan Africa?
p392
aVHow do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,
p393
aVand speak languages we don't speak,
p394
aVand we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order
p395
aVto achieve on this great mission,
p396
aVwe have to be able to do it.
p397
aVIncidentally, they did pull it off.
p398
aVAnd they released the first-ever world poll.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.
p401
aVFirst of all: we all form tribes, all of us.
p402
aVYou're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach
p403
aVof the tribes that you have.
p404
aVBut the question on the table is this:
p405
aVWhat kind of an impact are the tribes
p406
aVthat you are in making?
p407
aVYou're hearing one presentation after another,
p408
aVoften representing a group of people, a tribe,
p409
aVabout how they have changed the world.
p410
aVIf you do what we've talked about, you listen
p411
aVfor how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.
p412
aVAnd you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.
p413
aVYou remember to talk all five culture stages.
p414
aVBecause we've got people in all five, around us.
p415
aVAnd the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:
p416
aVWill your tribes change the world?
p417
aVThank you very much.
p418
aV(Applause)

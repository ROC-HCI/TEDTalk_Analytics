VWhat I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity,
p5
aVis simply repeat many of the points
p6
aVthat the three people before me have already made,
p7
aVbut do them \u2014
p8
aVthis is called "creative collaboration;"
p9
aVit's actually called "borrowing" \u2014
p10
aVbut do it through a particular perspective,
p11
aVand that is to ask about the role of users and consumers
p12
aVin this emerging world of
p13
aVcollaborative creativity
p14
aVthat Jimmy and others have talked about.
p15
aa(lp16
VLet me just ask you, to start with,
p17
aVthis simple question:
p18
aVwho invented the mountain bike?
p19
aVBecause traditional economic theory would say,
p20
aVwell, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation
p21
aVthat had a big R&D lab
p22
aVwhere they were thinking up new projects,
p23
aVand it came out of there. It didn't come from there.
p24
aVAnother answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius
p25
aVworking in his garage, who,
p26
aVworking away on different kinds of bikes, comes up
p27
aVwith a bike out of thin air.
p28
aa(lp29
VIt didn't come from there. The mountain bike
p30
aVcame from users, came from young users,
p31
aVparticularly a group in Northern California,
p32
aVwho were frustrated with traditional racing bikes,
p33
aVwhich were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode,
p34
aVor your big brother, and they're very glamorous.
p35
aVBut also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode,
p36
aVwhich sort of had big handlebars like that, and they were too heavy.
p37
aVSo, they got the frames from these big bikes,
p38
aVput them together with the gears from the racing bikes,
p39
aVgot the brakes from motorcycles,
p40
aVand sort of mixed and matched various ingredients.
p41
aVAnd for the first, I don't know, three to five years of their life,
p42
aVmountain bikes were known as "clunkers."
p43
aVAnd they were just made in a community of bikers,
p44
aVmainly in Northern California.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd then one of these companies that was importing parts
p47
aVfor the clunkers decided to set up in business,
p48
aVstart selling them to other people,
p49
aVand gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin,
p50
aVand it probably was, I don't know,
p51
aV10, maybe even 15, years,
p52
aVbefore the big bike companies
p53
aVrealized there was a market.
p54
aVThirty years later,
p55
aVmountain bike sales
p56
aVand mountain bike equipment
p57
aVaccount for 65 percent of bike sales in America.
p58
aVThat's 58 billion dollars.
p59
aa(lp60
VThis is a category entirely created by consumers
p61
aVthat would not have been created by the mainstream bike market
p62
aVbecause they couldn't see the need,
p63
aVthe opportunity;
p64
aVthey didn't have the incentive to innovate.
p65
aVThe one thing I think I disagree with
p66
aVabout Yochai's presentation
p67
aVis when he said the Internet causes
p68
aVthis distributive capacity for innovation to come alive.
p69
aVIt's when the Internet combines
p70
aVwith these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers \u2014
p71
aVwho are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate;
p72
aVthey've got the tools; they want to \u2014
p73
aVthat you get this kind of explosion
p74
aVof creative collaboration.
p75
aVAnd out of that, you get the need for the kind of things
p76
aVthat Jimmy was talking about, which is our new kinds of organization,
p77
aVor a better way to put it:
p78
aVhow do we organize ourselves without organizations?
p79
aVThat's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized,
p80
aVto achieve large and complex tasks,
p81
aVlike innovating new software programs.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo this is a huge challenge
p84
aVto the way we think creativity comes about.
p85
aVThe traditional view, still enshrined
p86
aVin much of the way that we think about creativity
p87
aV\u2014 in organizations, in government \u2014
p88
aVis that creativity is about special people:
p89
aVwear baseball caps the wrong way round,
p90
aVcome to conferences like this, in special places,
p91
aVelite universities, R&D labs in the forests, water,
p92
aVmaybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors,
p93
aVyou know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table.
p94
aVSpecial people, special places, think up special ideas,
p95
aVthen you have a pipeline that takes the ideas
p96
aVdown to the waiting consumers, who are passive.
p97
aVThey can say "yes" or "no" to the invention.
p98
aVThat's the idea of creativity.
p99
aVWhat's the policy recommendation out of that
p100
aVif you're in government, or you're running a large company?
p101
aVMore special people, more special places.
p102
aVBuild creative clusters in cities;
p103
aVcreate more R&D parks, so on and so forth.
p104
aVExpand the pipeline down to the consumers.
p105
aa(lp106
VWell this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.
p107
aVI think it's always been wrong,
p108
aVbecause I think always creativity has been highly collaborative,
p109
aVand it's probably been largely interactive.
p110
aVBut it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong
p111
aVis that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline.
p112
aVThe ideas are coming back from the consumers,
p113
aVand they're often ahead of the producers.
p114
aVWhy is that?
p115
aVWell, one issue
p116
aVis that radical innovation,
p117
aVwhen you've got ideas that
p118
aVaffect a large number of technologies or people,
p119
aVhave a great deal of uncertainty attached to them.
p120
aVThe payoffs to innovation are greatest
p121
aVwhere the uncertainty is highest.
p122
aVAnd when you get a radical innovation,
p123
aVit's often very uncertain how it can be applied.
p124
aa(lp125
VThe whole history of telephony
p126
aVis a story of dealing with that uncertainty.
p127
aVThe very first landline telephones,
p128
aVthe inventors thought
p129
aVthat they would be used for people to listen in
p130
aVto live performances
p131
aVfrom West End theaters.
p132
aVWhen the mobile telephone companies invented SMS,
p133
aVthey had no idea what it was for;
p134
aVit was only when that technology got into the hands
p135
aVof teenage users
p136
aVthat they invented the use.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo the more radical the innovation,
p139
aVthe more the uncertainty,
p140
aVthe more you need innovation in use
p141
aVto work out what a technology is for.
p142
aVAll of our patents, our entire approach
p143
aVto patents and invention, is based on the idea
p144
aVthat the inventor knows what the invention is for;
p145
aVwe can say what it's for.
p146
aVMore and more, the inventors of things
p147
aVwill not be able to say that in advance.
p148
aVIt will be worked out in use,
p149
aVin collaboration with users.
p150
aVWe like to think that invention is
p151
aVa sort of moment of creation:
p152
aVthere is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea.
p153
aVThe truth is that most creativity
p154
aVis cumulative and collaborative;
p155
aVlike Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.
p156
aa(lp157
VThe second reason why users are more and more important
p158
aVis that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations.
p159
aVIf you want to find the big new ideas,
p160
aVit's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets,
p161
aVin big organizations.
p162
aVAnd just look inside large organizations
p163
aVand you'll see why that is so.
p164
aVSo, you're in a big corporation.
p165
aVYou're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder.
p166
aVDo you go into your board and say,
p167
aV"Look, I've got a fantastic idea
p168
aVfor an embryonic product
p169
aVin a marginal market,
p170
aVwith consumers we've never dealt with before,
p171
aVand I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?"
p172
aVNo, what you do, is you go in and you say,
p173
aV"I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation
p174
aVto an existing product we sell through existing channels
p175
aVto existing users, and I can guarantee
p176
aVyou get this much return out of it over the next three years."
p177
aa(lp178
VBig corporations have an in-built tendency
p179
aVto reinforce past success.
p180
aVThey've got so much sunk in it
p181
aVthat it's very difficult for them to spot
p182
aVemerging new markets. Emerging new markets, then,
p183
aVare the breeding grounds for passionate users.
p184
aVBest example:
p185
aVwho in the music industry,
p186
aV30 years ago, would have said,
p187
aV"Yes, let's invent a musical form
p188
aVwhich is all about dispossessed black men
p189
aVin ghettos expressing their frustration
p190
aVwith the world through a form of music
p191
aVthat many people find initially quite difficult to listen to.
p192
aVThat sounds like a winner; we'll go with it."
p193
aV(Laughter).
p194
aVSo what happens? Rap music is created by the users.
p195
aVThey do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment;
p196
aVthey distribute it themselves.
p197
aV30 years later,
p198
aVrap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture \u2014
p199
aVwould never have come from the big companies.
p200
aVHad to start \u2014 this is the third point \u2014
p201
aVwith these pro-ams.
p202
aa(lp203
VThis is the phrase that I've used in
p204
aVsome stuff which I've done
p205
aVwith a think tank in London called Demos,
p206
aVwhere we've been looking at these people who are amateurs \u2014
p207
aVi.e., they do it for the love of it \u2014
p208
aVbut they want to do it to very high standards.
p209
aVAnd across a whole range of fields \u2014
p210
aVfrom software, astronomy,
p211
aVnatural sciences,
p212
aVvast areas of leisure and culture
p213
aVlike kite-surfing, so on and so forth \u2014
p214
aVyou find people who want to do things because they love it,
p215
aVbut they want to do these things to very high standards.
p216
aVThey work at their leisure, if you like.
p217
aVThey take their leisure very seriously:
p218
aVthey acquire skills; they invest time;
p219
aVthey use technology that's getting cheaper \u2014 it's not just the Internet:
p220
aVcameras, design technology,
p221
aVleisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth.
p222
aVLargely through globalization,
p223
aVa lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper.
p224
aVMore knowledgeable consumers, more educated,
p225
aVmore able to connect with one another,
p226
aVmore able to do things together.
p227
aVConsumption, in that sense, is an expression
p228
aVof their productive potential.
p229
aVWhy, we found, people were interested in this,
p230
aVis that at work they don't feel very expressed.
p231
aVThey don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them,
p232
aVso they pick up these kinds of activities.
p233
aVThis has huge organizational implications
p234
aVfor very large areas of life.
p235
aa(lp236
VTake astronomy as an example,
p237
aVwhich Yochai has already mentioned.
p238
aVTwenty years ago, 30 years ago,
p239
aVonly big professional astronomers
p240
aVwith very big telescopes could see far into space.
p241
aVAnd there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank,
p242
aVand when I was a kid, it was amazing,
p243
aVbecause the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails.
p244
aVAnd it was huge \u2014 it was absolutely enormous.
p245
aVNow, six
p246
aVamateur astronomers, working with the Internet,
p247
aVwith Dobsonian digital telescopes \u2014
p248
aVwhich are pretty much open source \u2014
p249
aVwith some light sensors
p250
aVdeveloped over the last 10 years, the Internet \u2014
p251
aVthey can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago.
p252
aVSo here in astronomy, you have this vast explosion
p253
aVof new productive resources.
p254
aVThe users can be producers.
p255
aa(lp256
VWhat does this mean, then, for our
p257
aVorganizational landscape?
p258
aVWell, just imagine a world,
p259
aVfor the moment, divided into two camps.
p260
aVOver here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model:
p261
aVspecial people, special places;
p262
aVpatent it, push it down the pipeline
p263
aVto largely waiting, passive consumers.
p264
aVOver here, let's imagine we've got
p265
aVWikipedia, Linux, and beyond \u2014 open source.
p266
aVThis is open; this is closed.
p267
aVThis is new; this is traditional.
p268
aVWell, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty,
p269
aVis what Yochai has said already \u2014
p270
aVis there is a great big struggle
p271
aVbetween those two organizational forms.
p272
aVThese people over there will do everything they can
p273
aVto stop these kinds of organizations succeeding,
p274
aVbecause they're threatened by them.
p275
aVAnd so the debates about
p276
aVcopyright, digital rights, so on and so forth \u2014
p277
aVthese are all about trying to stifle, in my view,
p278
aVthese kinds of organizations.
p279
aVWhat we're seeing is a complete corruption
p280
aVof the idea of patents and copyright.
p281
aVMeant to be a way to incentivize invention,
p282
aVmeant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge,
p283
aVthey are increasingly being used by large companies
p284
aVto create thickets of patents
p285
aVto prevent innovation taking place.
p286
aa(lp287
VLet me just give you two examples.
p288
aVThe first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist
p289
aVand saying, "I've got a fantastic idea.
p290
aVI've invented this brilliant new program
p291
aVthat is much, much better than Microsoft Outlook."
p292
aVWhich venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture
p293
aVcompeting with Microsoft, with Microsoft Outlook? No one.
p294
aVThat is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come \u2014
p295
aVwill only come \u2014
p296
aVfrom an open-source kind of project.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo, there is a huge competitive argument
p299
aVabout sustaining the capacity
p300
aVfor open-source and consumer-driven innovation,
p301
aVbecause it's one of the greatest
p302
aVcompetitive levers against monopoly.
p303
aVThere'll be huge professional arguments as well.
p304
aVBecause the professionals, over here
p305
aVin these closed organizations \u2014
p306
aVthey might be academics; they might be programmers;
p307
aVthey might be doctors; they might be journalists \u2014
p308
aVmy former profession \u2014
p309
aVsay, "No, no \u2014 you can't trust these people over here."
p310
aa(lp311
VWhen I started in journalism \u2014
p312
aVFinancial Times, 20 years ago \u2014
p313
aVit was very, very exciting
p314
aVto see someone reading the newspaper.
p315
aVAnd you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube
p316
aVto see if they were reading your article.
p317
aVUsually they were reading the share prices,
p318
aVand the bit of the paper with your article on
p319
aVwas on the floor, or something like that,
p320
aVand you know, "For heaven's sake, what are they doing!
p321
aVThey're not reading my brilliant article!"
p322
aVAnd we allowed users, readers,
p323
aVtwo places where they could contribute to the paper:
p324
aVthe letters page, where they could write a letter in,
p325
aVand we would condescend to them, cut it in half,
p326
aVand print it three days later.
p327
aVOr the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor \u2014
p328
aVhad been to school with him, slept with his wife \u2014
p329
aVthey could write an article for the op-ed page.
p330
aVThose were the two places.
p331
aa(lp332
VShock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers.
p333
aVThat's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write.
p334
aVBut they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think
p335
aVthat the bloggers want to be journalists;
p336
aVthey don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice.
p337
aVThey want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation.
p338
aVThey want to be part of that flow of information.
p339
aVWhat's happening there is that the whole domain
p340
aVof creativity is expanding.
p341
aVSo, there's going to be a tremendous struggle.
p342
aVBut, also, there's going to be tremendous movement
p343
aVfrom the open to the closed.
p344
aa(lp345
VWhat you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical,
p346
aVand these, I think, are two challenges
p347
aVfor the open movement.
p348
aVThe first is:
p349
aVcan we really survive on volunteers?
p350
aVIf this is so critical,
p351
aVdo we not need it funded, organized, supported
p352
aVin much more structured ways?
p353
aVI think the idea of creating the Red Cross
p354
aVfor information and knowledge is a fantastic idea,
p355
aVbut can we really organize that, just on volunteers?
p356
aVWhat kind of changes do we need in public policy
p357
aVand funding to make that possible?
p358
aVWhat's the role of the BBC,
p359
aVfor instance, in that world?
p360
aVWhat should be the role of public policy?
p361
aVAnd finally, what I think you will see
p362
aVis the intelligent, closed organizations
p363
aVmoving increasingly in the open direction.
p364
aVSo it's not going to be a contest between two camps,
p365
aVbut, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting places
p366
aVthat people will occupy.
p367
aVNew organizational models coming about,
p368
aVmixing closed and open in tricky ways.
p369
aVIt won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux \u2014
p370
aVthere'll be all sorts of things in between.
p371
aVAnd those organizational models, it turns out,
p372
aVare incredibly powerful,
p373
aVand the people who can understand them
p374
aVwill be very, very successful.
p375
aa(lp376
VLet me just give you one final example
p377
aVof what that means.
p378
aVI was in Shanghai,
p379
aVin an office block
p380
aVbuilt on what was a rice paddy five years ago \u2014
p381
aVone of the 2,500 skyscrapers
p382
aVthey've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years.
p383
aVAnd I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan.
p384
aVTimothy Chan set up an Internet business
p385
aVin 2000.
p386
aVDidn't go into the Internet, kept his money,
p387
aVdecided to go into computer games.
p388
aVHe runs a company called Shanda,
p389
aVwhich is the largest computer games company in China.
p390
aVNine thousand servers all over China,
p391
aVhas 250 million subscribers.
p392
aVAt any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.
p393
aVHow many people does he employ
p394
aVto service that population?
p395
aV500 people.
p396
aVWell, how can he service
p397
aV250 million people from 500 employees?
p398
aVBecause basically, he doesn't service them.
p399
aVHe gives them a platform;
p400
aVhe gives them some rules; he gives them the tools
p401
aVand then he kind of orchestrates the conversation;
p402
aVhe orchestrates the action.
p403
aVBut actually, a lot of the content
p404
aVis created by the users themselves.
p405
aVAnd it creates a kind of stickiness
p406
aVbetween the community and the company
p407
aVwhich is really, really powerful.
p408
aa(lp409
VThe best measure of that: so you go into one of his games,
p410
aVyou create a character
p411
aVthat you develop in the course of the game.
p412
aVIf, for some reason, your credit card bounces,
p413
aVor there's some other problem,
p414
aVyou lose your character.
p415
aVYou've got two options.
p416
aVOne option: you can create a new character,
p417
aVright from scratch, but with none of the history of your player.
p418
aVThat costs about 100 dollars.
p419
aVOr you can get on a plane, fly to Shanghai,
p420
aVqueue up outside Shanda's offices \u2014
p421
aVcost probably 600, 700 dollars \u2014
p422
aVand reclaim your character, get your history back.
p423
aVEvery morning, there are 600 people queuing
p424
aVoutside their offices
p425
aVto reclaim these characters. (Laughter)
p426
aVSo this is about companies built on communities,
p427
aVthat provide communities with tools,
p428
aVresources, platforms in which they can share.
p429
aVHe's not open source,
p430
aVbut it's very, very powerful.
p431
aa(lp432
VSo here is one of the challenges, I think,
p433
aVfor people like me, who
p434
aVdo a lot of work with government.
p435
aVIf you're a games company,
p436
aVand you've got a million players in your game,
p437
aVyou only need one percent of them
p438
aVto be co-developers, contributing ideas,
p439
aVand you've got a development workforce
p440
aVof 10,000 people.
p441
aVImagine you could take all the children
p442
aVin education in Britain, and one percent of them
p443
aVwere co-developers of education.
p444
aVWhat would that do to the resources available
p445
aVto the education system?

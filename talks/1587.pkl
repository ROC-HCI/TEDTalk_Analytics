VBeau Lotto: So, this game is very simple.
p5
aVAll you have to do is read what you see. Right?
p6
aVSo, I'm going to count to you, so we don't all do it together.
p7
aa(lp8
VOkay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this?
p9
aa(lp10
VBL: Amazing. What about this one? One, two, three.Audience: You are not reading this.
p11
aa(lp12
VBL: All right. One, two, three. (Laughter)
p13
aVIf you were Portuguese, right? How about this one? One, two, three.
p14
aa(lp15
VAudience: What are you reading?
p16
aa(lp17
VBL: What are you reading? There are no words there.
p18
aVI said, read what you're seeing. Right?
p19
aVIt literally says, "Wat ar ou rea in?" (Laughter) Right?
p20
aVThat's what you should have said. Right? Why is this?
p21
aa(lp22
VIt's because perception is grounded in our experience.
p23
aVRight? The brain takes meaningless information
p24
aVand makes meaning out of it, which means we never see
p25
aVwhat's there, we never see information,
p26
aVwe only ever see what was useful to see in the past.
p27
aVAll right? Which means, when it comes to perception,
p28
aVwe're all like this frog.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVRight? It's getting information. It's generating behavior
p31
aVthat's useful. (Laughter)
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
V(Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause)
p35
aa(lp36
VBL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way,
p37
aVwe get a little bit annoyed, right?
p38
aVBut we're talking about perception here, right?
p39
aVAnd perception underpins everything we think, we know,
p40
aVwe believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear,
p41
aVfalling in love, everything begins with perception.
p42
aVNow if perception is grounded in our history, it means
p43
aVwe're only ever responding according to what we've done before.
p44
aVBut actually, it's a tremendous problem,
p45
aVbecause how can we ever see differently?
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently,
p48
aVand all new perceptions begin in the same way.
p49
aVThey begin with a question.
p50
aVThe problem with questions is they create uncertainty.
p51
aVNow, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily
p52
aVa bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late.
p53
aVOkay? (Laughter)
p54
aVEven seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.
p55
aVRight? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears
p56
aVare you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because
p57
aVit's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still.
p58
aVYour brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information, and it gets ill.
p59
aVThe question "why?" is one of the most dangerous things you can do,
p60
aVbecause it takes you into uncertainty.
p61
aVAnd yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever
p62
aVdo anything new is to step into that space.
p63
aVSo how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately,
p64
aVevolution has given us an answer, right?
p65
aVAnd it enables us to address even the most difficult
p66
aVof questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty.
p67
aVThey're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right?
p68
aVIt's easy to ask questions about how did life begin,
p69
aVor what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already
p70
aVis really stepping into that space.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?
p73
aVIt's play.
p74
aVNow play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you
p75
aVthat actually it's a way of being.
p76
aVPlay is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty
p77
aVis actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun.
p78
aVRight? It's adaptable to change. Right? It opens possibility,
p79
aVand it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding,
p80
aVand it's intrinsically motivated. What that means
p81
aVis that we play to play. Play is its own reward.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow if you look at these five ways of being,
p84
aVthese are the exact same ways of being you need
p85
aVin order to be a good scientist.
p86
aVScience is not defined by the method section of a paper.
p87
aVIt's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true
p88
aVfor anything that is creative.
p89
aVSo if you add rules to play, you have a game.
p90
aVThat's actually what an experiment is.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo armed with these two ideas,
p93
aVthat science is a way of being and experiments are play,
p94
aVwe asked, can anyone become a scientist?
p95
aVAnd who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children?
p96
aVBecause they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena
p97
aVdown to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this
p98
aVwas to not just get the kids to see science differently,
p99
aVbut, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right?
p100
aa(lp101
VThe first step was to ask a question.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, I should say that we didn't get funding for this study
p104
aVbecause the scientists said small children couldn't make
p105
aVa useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids couldn't do it.
p106
aVSo we did it anyway. Right? Of course.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print
p109
aVso you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with
p110
aVwere actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right?
p111
aVSo they were asking questions that were significant
p112
aVto expert scientists.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow here, I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right?
p115
aVShe was one of the young people who was involved in this study,
p116
aVand she's now one of the youngest published scientists
p117
aVin the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage,
p118
aVwill be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right?
p119
aVNow, science and asking questions is about courage.
p120
aVNow she is the personification of courage, because she's
p121
aVgoing to stand up here and talk to you all.
p122
aVSo Amy, would you please come up? (Applause)
p123
aV(Applause)
p124
aVSo Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call
p125
aVthe Blackawton Bees Project, and first she's going to tell you
p126
aVthe question that they came up with. So go ahead, Amy.
p127
aa(lp128
VAmy O'Toole: Thank you, Beau. We thought
p129
aVthat it was easy to see the link between humans and apes
p130
aVin the way that we think, because we look alike.
p131
aVBut we wondered if there's a possible link
p132
aVwith other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees
p133
aVthought similar, since they seem so different from us.
p134
aVSo we asked if humans and bees might solve
p135
aVcomplex problems in the same way.
p136
aVReally, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt
p137
aVthemselves to new situations using previously learned rules
p138
aVand conditions. So what if bees can think like us?
p139
aVWell, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect
p140
aVwith only one million brain cells.
p141
aVBut it actually makes a lot of sense they should,
p142
aVbecause bees, like us, can recognize a good flower
p143
aVregardless of the time of day, the light, the weather,
p144
aVor from any angle they approach it from. (Applause)
p145
aa(lp146
VBL: So the next step was to design an experiment,
p147
aVwhich is a game. So the kids went off and they designed
p148
aVthis experiment, and so \u2014 well, game \u2014 and so,
p149
aVAmy, can you tell us what the game was,
p150
aVand the puzzle that you set the bees?
p151
aa(lp152
VAO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.
p153
aVWe asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color,
p154
aVbut to a certain color flower only
p155
aVwhen it's in a certain pattern.
p156
aVThey were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers
p157
aVif the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue,
p158
aVor if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.
p159
aVNow there's a number of different rules the bees can learn
p160
aVto solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?
p161
aVWhat was really exciting about this project was we,
p162
aVand Beau, had no idea whether it would work.
p163
aVIt was completely new, and no one had done it before,
p164
aVincluding adults. (Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VBL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.
p167
aVIt's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing,
p168
aVbecause that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher
p169
aVnot to know what's going to happen at the end of the day \u2014
p170
aVso much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was
p171
aVthe collaborator on this project. Okay?
p172
aVSo I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study
p173
aVbecause actually you can read about it, but the next step
p174
aVis observation. So here are some of the students
p175
aVdoing the observations. They're recording the data
p176
aVof where the bees fly.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do \u2014Student: 5C.
p179
aa(lp180
VDave Strudwick: Is she still going up here?Student: Yeah.
p181
aa(lp182
VDave Strudwick: So you keep track of each.Student: Henry, can you help me here?
p183
aa(lp184
VBL: "Can you help me, Henry?" What good scientist says that, right?
p185
aa(lp186
VStudent: There's two up there.
p187
aVAnd three in here.
p188
aa(lp189
VBL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data.
p190
aVThey do the simple mathematics, averaging, etc., etc.
p191
aVAnd now we want to share. That's the next step.
p192
aVSo we're going to write this up and try to submit this
p193
aVfor publication. Right? So we have to write it up.
p194
aVSo we go, of course, to the pub. All right? (Laughter)
p195
aVThe one on the left is mine, okay? (Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, I tell them, a paper has four different sections:
p198
aVan introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion.
p199
aVThe introduction says, what's the question and why?
p200
aVMethods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation?
p201
aVAnd the discussion is, who cares? Right?
p202
aVThat's a science paper, basically. (Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative,
p205
aVwhich means that this paper is written in kidspeak.
p206
aVIt's not written by me. It's written by Amy
p207
aVand the other students in the class. As a consequence,
p208
aVthis science paper begins, "Once upon a time ... " (Laughter)
p209
aVThe results section, it says: "Training phase, the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh." Right? (Laughter)
p210
aVAnd the methods, it says, "Then we put the bees
p211
aVinto the fridge (and made bee pie)," smiley face. Right? (Laughter)
p212
aVThis is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published.
p213
aVSo here's the title page. We have a number of authors there.
p214
aVAll the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.
p215
aVThe first author is Blackawton Primary School, because
p216
aVif it were ever referenced, it would be "Blackawton et al,"
p217
aVand not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal,
p218
aVand it says this. It said many things, but it said this.
p219
aV"I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways." (Laughter)
p220
aVIn other words, it starts off "once upon a time,"
p221
aVthe figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VSo we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves,
p224
aVwho is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world,
p225
aVand he says, "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p226
aV"and it certainly deserves wide exposure."
p227
aVLarry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "The paper is magnificent.
p228
aVThe work would be publishable if done by adults."
p229
aa(lp230
VSo what did we do? We send it back to the editor.
p231
aVThey say no.
p232
aVSo we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write
p233
aVa commentary situating the findings for scientists, right,
p234
aVputting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters.
p235
aVAnd there, it was reviewed by five independent referees,
p236
aVand it was published. Okay? (Applause)
p237
aV(Applause)
p238
aa(lp239
VIt took four months to do the science,
p240
aVtwo years to get it published. (Laughter)
p241
aVTypical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and
p242
aVher friends the youngest published scientists in the world.
p243
aVWhat was the feedback like?
p244
aVWell, it was published two days before Christmas,
p245
aVdownloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right?
p246
aVIt was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine.
p247
aVIt's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters.
p248
aVIt's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.
p249
aVLast year, it was the second-most downloaded paper
p250
aVby Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists
p251
aVand teachers but the public as well.
p252
aVAnd I'll just read one.
p253
aa(lp254
V"I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have
p255
aVwords to explain exactly how I am feeling right now.
p256
aVWhat you guys have done is real, true and amazing.
p257
aVCuriosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic
p258
aVand most important things to do science.
p259
aVWho else can have these qualities more than children?
p260
aVPlease congratulate your children's team from my side."
p261
aa(lp262
VSo I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor.
p263
aVCan I do it on you? (Laughter)
p264
aVOh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay.
p265
aVNow, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter)
p266
aVFor me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter)
p267
aVAnd you like technology, right?
p268
aa(lp269
VShimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.
p270
aa(lp271
VBL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay.
p272
aVNow ... (Laughter)
p273
aVOkay. (Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VNow, we're going to do a little demonstration, right?
p276
aVYou have to close your eyes, and you have to point
p277
aVwhere you hear me clapping. All right?
p278
aa(lp279
V(Clapping)
p280
aa(lp281
V(Clapping)
p282
aa(lp283
VOkay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three?
p284
aa(lp285
VAudience: (Shouts)
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
V(Shouts) (Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VBrilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time.
p291
aVEveryone over there shout. (Shouts)
p292
aVWhere's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause)
p293
aa(lp294
VThank you very much. (Applause)
p295
aa(lp296
VWhat's the point? The point is what science does for us.
p297
aVRight? We normally walk through life responding,
p298
aVbut if we ever want to do anything different, we have to
p299
aVstep into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes,
p300
aVhe was able to see the world in a new way.
p301
aVThat's what science offers us. It offers the possibility
p302
aVto step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?
p303
aa(lp304
VNow, true science education I think should be about
p305
aVgiving people a voice and enabling to express that voice,
p306
aVso I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.
p307
aVSo, Amy?
p308
aa(lp309
VAO: This project was really exciting for me,
p310
aVbecause it brought the process of discovery to life,
p311
aVand it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone,
p312
aVhas the potential to discover something new,
p313
aVand that a small question can lead into a big discovery.
p314
aVChanging the way a person thinks about something
p315
aVcan be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person
p316
aVfeels about change.
p317
aVBut changing the way I thought about science was
p318
aVsurprisingly easy. Once we played the games
p319
aVand then started to think about the puzzle,
p320
aVI then realized that science isn't just a boring subject,
p321
aVand that anyone can discover something new.
p322
aVYou just need an opportunity. My opportunity came
p323
aVin the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.
p324
aa(lp325
VThank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause)

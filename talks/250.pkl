VThe Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.
p5
aVThat was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old
p6
aVand I got a B+. (Laughter)
p7
aVWhat I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.
p8
aVAnd I'm gonna try and do that within
p9
aVthe 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within,
p10
aVand to follow the TED commandments:
p11
aVthat is, actually, something that creates
p12
aVa near-death experience,
p13
aVbut near-death is good for creativity.
p14
aV(Laughter) OK.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo, I also want to explain,
p17
aVbecause Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me
p18
aVif I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.
p19
aVAnd I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.
p20
aVWhen I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily;
p21
aVI mean me, and my right brain, my left brain
p22
aVand the one that's in between that is the censor
p23
aVand tells me what I'm saying is wrong.
p24
aVAnd I'm going do that also by looking at
p25
aVwhat I think is part of my creative process,
p26
aVwhich includes a number of things that happened, actually \u2014
p27
aVthe nothing started even earlier than the moment
p28
aVin which I'm creating something new.
p29
aVAnd that includes nature, and nurture,
p30
aVand what I refer to as nightmares.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow in the nature area, we look at whether or not
p33
aVwe are innately equipped with something, perhaps
p34
aVin our brains, some abnormal chromosome
p35
aVthat causes this muse-like effect.
p36
aVAnd some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.
p37
aVAnd others, like my mother,
p38
aVwould say that I get my material from past lives.
p39
aVSome people would also say that creativity
p40
aVmay be a function of some other neurological quirk \u2014
p41
aVvan Gogh syndrome \u2014 that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.
p42
aVI do have to say, somebody \u2014 I read recently
p43
aVthat van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic,
p44
aVthat he might have had temporal lobe seizures,
p45
aVand that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't \u2014
p46
aVI suppose it does something in some part of your brain.
p47
aVAnd I will mention that I actually developed
p48
aVtemporal lobe seizures a number of years ago,
p49
aVbut it was during the time I was writing my last book,
p50
aVand some people say that book is quite different.
p51
aa(lp52
VI think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis:
p53
aVyou know, who am I, why am I this particular person,
p54
aVwhy am I not black like everybody else?
p55
aVAnd sometimes you're equipped with skills,
p56
aVbut they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.
p57
aVI used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.
p58
aVAnd I had a miniature poodle.
p59
aVAnd it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.
p60
aVBecause all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.
p61
aVAnd I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.
p62
aVAnd then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be,
p63
aVand you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad,
p64
aVbut it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make
p65
aVmy living out of the artful arrangement of words.
p66
aa(lp67
VAlso, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.
p68
aVAnd I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had,
p69
aVand that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.
p70
aVThat figure right there, by the way,
p71
aVfigure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old,
p72
aVand it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.
p73
aVI have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15,
p74
aVthis was supposed to be my side occupation,
p75
aVand it led to a sense of failure.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut actually, there was something quite real in my life
p78
aVthat happened when I was about 14.
p79
aVAnd it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father,
p80
aVsix months later, had brain tumors.
p81
aVAnd my mother believed that something had gone wrong,
p82
aVand she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.
p83
aVMy father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles,
p84
aVand that God's will would take care of that.
p85
aVBut, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.
p86
aVAnd after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses
p87
aV\u2014 she went looking through all the reasons in the universe
p88
aVwhy this would have happened.
p89
aVEverything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.
p90
aVThere was a reason for everything.
p91
aVAnd one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother,
p92
aVwho had died when she was very young, was angry at her.
p93
aVAnd so, I had this notion of death all around me,
p94
aVbecause my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.
p95
aVAnd when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon,
p96
aVyou begin to think very much about everything.
p97
aVYou become very creative, in a survival sense.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd this, then, led to my big questions.
p100
aVAnd they're the same ones that I have today.
p101
aVAnd they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?
p102
aVAnd the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?
p103
aVIt's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.
p104
aVBecause, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300,
p105
aVyou have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen,
p106
aVin what order they happen. What are the influences?
p107
aVHow do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?
p108
aVAnd it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.
p109
aVIt's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe,
p110
aVas the creator of that universe.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd you see, there's a lot of back and forth
p113
aVin trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out
p114
aV\u2014 years and years, oftentimes.
p115
aVSo, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability
p116
aVto repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.
p117
aVAnd I got a lot of them during what's been going on
p118
aVthroughout this conference,
p119
aValmost everything that's been going on.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association:
p122
aVquantum mechanics, which I really don't understand,
p123
aVbut I'm still gonna use it as the process
p124
aVfor explaining how it is the metaphor.
p125
aVSo, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.
p126
aVAnd it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.
p127
aVThere's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.
p128
aVBut when you make those associations,
p129
aVyou want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story,
p130
aVand what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.
p131
aVAnd that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.
p132
aa(lp133
VThere is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics,
p134
aVas I understand it. (Laughter)
p135
aVAnd this happens constantly in the writing.
p136
aVAnd there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect,
p137
aVin which you're looking for something, and
p138
aVyou know, things are happening simultaneously,
p139
aVand you're looking at it in a different way,
p140
aVand you're trying to really look for the about-ness,
p141
aVor what is this story about. And if you try too hard,
p142
aVthen you will only write the about.
p143
aVYou won't discover anything.
p144
aVAnd what you were supposed to find,
p145
aVwhat you hoped to find in some serendipitous way,
p146
aVis no longer there.
p147
aVNow, I don't want to ignore
p148
aVthe other side of what happens in our universe,
p149
aVlike many of our scientists have.
p150
aVAnd so, I am going to just throw in string theory here,
p151
aVand just say that creative people are multidimensional,
p152
aVand there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.
p153
aV(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time.
p154
aa(lp155
VThere is also a big question of ambiguity.
p156
aVAnd I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.
p157
aVAnd you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.
p158
aVAnd ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable
p159
aVin my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.
p160
aVIt is constantly there. And, just as an example,
p161
aVthis is one that recently came to me.
p162
aVIt was something I read in an editorial by a woman
p163
aVwho was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said,
p164
aV"Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
p165
aVA very famous Chinese saying, she said.
p166
aVAnd that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there
p167
aVuntil things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.
p168
aVSo, there was another one that I came across,
p169
aVand it's "saving fish from drowning."
p170
aVAnd it's what Buddhist fishermen say,
p171
aVbecause they're not supposed to kill anything.
p172
aVAnd they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.
p173
aVSo their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning,
p174
aVand unfortunately, in the process the fish die.
p175
aa(lp176
VNow, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors
p177
aV\u2014 actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation,
p178
aVand it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me:
p179
aV"save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
p180
aVAnd it was a warning \u2014 don't get involved in other people's business,
p181
aVor you're going to get stuck.
p182
aVOK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.
p183
aVBut, both of these sayings \u2014 saving a fish from drowning,
p184
aVor saving a man from drowning \u2014 to me they had to do with intentions.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.
p187
aVAnd then we have intentions.
p188
aVThere's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do,
p189
aVand then we do something.
p190
aVAnd the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.
p191
aVMaybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?
p192
aVWhat are we supposed to do?
p193
aVDo we stay in for life,
p194
aVor do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good,
p195
aVand therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?
p196
aVThat is the ambiguity in my life
p197
aVthat really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called
p198
aV"Saving Fish From Drowning."
p199
aa(lp200
VI saw examples of that. Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.
p201
aVI got these hints everywhere.
p202
aVAnd then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.
p203
aVAnd then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues,
p204
aVand I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.
p205
aVAnd what I need, in effect, is a focus.
p206
aVAnd when I have the question, it is a focus.
p207
aVAnd all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through
p208
aVthat question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.
p209
aVAnd it seems like it's happening all the time.
p210
aVYou think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity,
p211
aVin which you're getting all this help from the universe.
p212
aVAnd it may also be explained that now you have a focus.
p213
aVAnd you are noticing it more often.
p214
aa(lp215
VBut you apply this.
p216
aVYou begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.
p217
aVYour brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?
p218
aVWhy or why not?
p219
aVIt may be something that is perhaps more serious
p220
aV\u2014 as I said, human rights in Burma.
p221
aVI was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show
p222
aVthat I approved of the military regime there.
p223
aVAnd then, after a while, I had to ask myself,
p224
aV"Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions
p225
aVthat other people have given us?"
p226
aVAnd it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up,
p227
aVand was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father,
p228
aVwho was a Baptist minister.
p229
aVSo I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions,
p230
aVand still didn't know that if I went there,
p231
aVwhat the result of that would be, if I wrote a book \u2014
p232
aVand I just would have to face that later, when the time came.
p233
aa(lp234
VWe are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.
p235
aVWe come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?
p236
aVNot all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals,
p237
aVso what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?
p238
aVAlso, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at,
p239
aVand we talked about today, is genocide.
p240
aVThis leads to this question.
p241
aVWhen I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable,
p242
aVand I consider what my intentions should be,
p243
aVI realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child
p244
aV\u2014 and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life,
p245
aVand what is my place in the universe?
p246
aa(lp247
VIt seems so obvious, and yet it is not.
p248
aVWe all hate moral ambiguity in some sense,
p249
aVand yet it is also absolutely necessary.
p250
aVIn writing a story, it is the place where I begin.
p251
aVSometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.
p252
aVMy mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book,
p253
aVbecause it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.
p254
aVInstead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally,
p255
aVfrom an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time,
p256
aVI actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself,
p257
aVand that actually was the way it happened.
p258
aVAnd my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.
p259
aa(lp260
VThere are also things, quite uncanny,
p261
aVwhich bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.
p262
aVIn this case, I was writing a story
p263
aVthat included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.
p264
aVAnd I needed to find something historically that would match that.
p265
aVAnd I took down this book, and I \u2014
p266
aVfirst page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period,
p267
aVand the kind of character I needed \u2014 was the Taiping rebellion,
p268
aVhappening in the area near Guilin, outside of that,
p269
aVand a character who thought he was the son of God.
p270
aa(lp271
VYou wonder, are these things random chance?
p272
aVWell, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?
p273
aVWhat are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?
p274
aVAnd that goes into the story, too.
p275
aVThese are the things I constantly think about from day to day.
p276
aVEspecially when good things happen,
p277
aVand, in particular, when bad things happen.
p278
aVBut I do think there's a kind of serendipity,
p279
aVand I do want to know what those elements are,
p280
aVso I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.
p281
aVBecause, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnother chance encounter is when I went to a place
p284
aV\u2014 I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place,
p285
aVand we ended up in this non-tourist location,
p286
aVa beautiful village, pristine.
p287
aVAnd we walked three valleys beyond,
p288
aVand the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous,
p289
aVa discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.
p290
aVAnd in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.
p291
aVFor some reason I wrote about cairns \u2014 stacks of rocks \u2014 that a man was building.
p292
aVAnd I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.
p293
aVI got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs,
p294
aVthat I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later,
p295
aVwalking along the beach, I came across this.
p296
aVAnd it was a man, a Chinese man,
p297
aVand he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.
p298
aVAnd I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"
p299
aVAnd he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."
p300
aVAnd this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.
p301
aVI had so many examples \u2014 I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story,
p302
aVand I cannot explain it.
p303
aVIs it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence
p304
aVin writing about these things?
p305
aVOr is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?
p306
aa(lp307
VA big thing that I also think about is accidents.
p308
aVAnd as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.
p309
aVWhat is the nature of accidents?
p310
aVAnd how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are,
p311
aVoutside of a court of law?
p312
aVI was able to see that in a firsthand way,
p313
aVwhen I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.
p314
aVAnd I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.
p315
aVAnd I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me
p316
aVif I wanted to write anything about China.
p317
aVAnd I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.
p318
aVAnd they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went,
p319
aVthere was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep,
p320
aVand his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.
p321
aV60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.
p322
aVResponsibility was assigned to the family.
p323
aVThe man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.
p324
aVAnd, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.
p325
aVIt's the son, not the father."
p326
aa(lp327
VWhen I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.
p328
aVIt takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.
p329
aVAnd so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.
p330
aVAnd I began to sense something different about the history,
p331
aVand what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village,
p332
aVand what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links
p333
aVwith other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.
p334
aVI was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using,
p335
aVa ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men
p336
aV\u2014 a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.
p337
aVNow you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners,
p338
aVwould say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while,
p339
aVand seeing the amazing things that happened,
p340
aVyou begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world,
p341
aVdetermining how things happen.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story,
p344
aVthe more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me
p345
aV\u2014 to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real,
p346
aVand that is where I'm gonna find the answers
p347
aVto how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.
p348
aVYears go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly,
p349
aVas I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.
p350
aVThe book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.
p351
aVIt is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.
p352
aVBut I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?
p353
aVAnd how do I create my own life?
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd I think it is by questioning,
p356
aVand saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.
p357
aVI believe in specifics, the specifics of story,
p358
aVand the past, the specifics of that past,
p359
aVand what is happening in the story at that point.
p360
aVI also believe that in thinking about things \u2014
p361
aVmy thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents,
p362
aVGod's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces \u2014
p363
aVI will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.
p364
aVI have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe,
p365
aVand did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?
p366
aVAnd I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined \u2014
p367
aVand yet is in that real world, the fictional world.
p368
aVAnd that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.
p369
aVAnd they have to be in all possibilities,
p370
aVincluding those I never considered before.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo, there are never complete answers.
p373
aVOr rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind
p374
aVmyself that there is uncertainty in everything,
p375
aVand that is good, because then I will discover something new.
p376
aVAnd if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me,
p377
aVit is to simply imagine.
p378
aVAnd to imagine is to put myself in that story,
p379
aVuntil there was only \u2014 there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story
p382
aV\u2014 in one story \u2014 then I come the closest, I think,
p383
aVto knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.
p384

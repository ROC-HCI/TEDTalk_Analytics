VNine years ago, I worked
p5
aVfor the U.S. government in Iraq,
p6
aVhelping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.
p7
aVAnd I was there, and I worked in that job
p8
aVbecause I believe that technology
p9
aVcan improve people's lives.
p10
aVOne afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper
p11
aVat the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad,
p12
aVand he said to me, "You Americans,
p13
aVyou can put a man on the moon,
p14
aVbut when I get home tonight,
p15
aVI won't be able to turn on my lights."
p16
aVAt the time, the U.S. government had spent
p17
aVmore than two billion dollars
p18
aVon electricity reconstruction.
p19
aVHow do you ensure technology reaches users?
p20
aVHow do you put it in their hands
p21
aVso that it is useful?
p22
aa(lp23
VSo those are the questions that my colleagues and I
p24
aVat D-Rev ask ourselves.
p25
aVAnd D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.
p26
aVAnd I took over the organization four years ago
p27
aVand really focused it on developing products
p28
aVthat actually reach users,
p29
aVand not just any users,
p30
aVbut customers who live on less than four dollars a day.
p31
aVOne of the key areas we've been working on recently
p32
aVis medical devices, and while it may not be obvious
p33
aVthat medical devices have something in common
p34
aVwith Iraq's electricity grid then,
p35
aVthere are some commonalities.
p36
aVDespite the advanced technology,
p37
aVit's not reaching the people who need it most.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on,
p40
aVthe ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee
p41
aVfor above-knee amputees.
p42
aVAnd this project started when the Jaipur Foot Organization,
p43
aVthe largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world,
p44
aVcame to the Bay Area and they said,
p45
aV"We need a better knee."
p46
aVChances are, if you're living on less than four dollars a day,
p47
aVand you're an amputee,
p48
aVyou've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.
p49
aVMost people think it's land mines,
p50
aVbut it's a vehicle accident.
p51
aVYou're walking by the side of the road
p52
aVand you're hit by a truck,
p53
aVor you're trying to to jump on a moving train,
p54
aVyou're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.
p55
aVAnd the reality is that if you don't have much money,
p56
aVlike this young named Kamal right here,
p57
aVthe option you really have
p58
aVis a bamboo staff to get around.
p59
aVAnd how big a problem is this?
p60
aVThere's over three million amputees every year
p61
aVwho need a new or replacement knee.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd what are their options?
p64
aVThis is a high-end. This is what we'd call a "smart knee."
p65
aVIt's got a microprocessor inside.
p66
aVIt can pretty much do anything,
p67
aVbut it's 20,000 dollars,
p68
aVand to give you a sense of who wears this,
p69
aVveterans, American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq
p70
aVwould be fit with something like this.
p71
aVThis is a low-end titanium knee.
p72
aVIt's a polycentric knee, and all that that means
p73
aVis the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism,
p74
aVthat mimics a natural human knee.
p75
aVBut at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive
p76
aVfor people like Kamal.
p77
aVAnd lastly, here you see a low-end knee.
p78
aVThis is a knee that's been designed specifically
p79
aVfor poor people.
p80
aVAnd while you have affordability,
p81
aVyou've lost on functionality.
p82
aVThe mechanism here is a single axis,
p83
aVand a single axis is like a door hinge.
p84
aVSo you can think about how unstable that would be.
p85
aVAnd this is the type of mechanism
p86
aa(lp87
Vthat the Jaipur Foot Organization was using when they were looking for a better knee,
p88
aVand I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like,
p89
aVbecause I'm showing you all these knees
p90
aVand I imagine it's hard to think  how it all fits together.
p91
aVSo at the top you have a socket,
p92
aVand this fits over someone's residual limb,
p93
aVand everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.
p94
aVAnd then you have the knee,
p95
aVand here I've got a single axis on the knee
p96
aVso you can see how it rotates,
p97
aVand then a pylon, and then a foot.
p98
aVAnd we've been able to develop a knee,
p99
aVa polycentric knee, so that type of knee
p100
aVthat acts like a human knee, mimics human gait,
p101
aVfor 80 dollars retail.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Applause)
p104
aa(lp105
VBut the key is, you can have this great invention,
p106
aVyou can have this great design, but how do you get it
p107
aVto the people who most need it?
p108
aVHow do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?
p109
aa(lp110
VSo at D-Rev, we've done some other projects,
p111
aVand we looked at three things that we really believe
p112
aVgets technologies to customers, to users,
p113
aVto people who need it.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd the first thing is that the product  needs to be world class.
p116
aVIt needs to perform on par
p117
aVor better than the best products on the market.
p118
aVRegardless of your income level,
p119
aVyou want the most beautiful,
p120
aVthe best product that there is.
p121
aVI'm going to show you a video now
p122
aVof a man named Ash. You can see him walking.
p123
aVHe's wearing the same knee system here
p124
aVwith a single axis knee.
p125
aVAnd he's doing a 10-meter walk test.
p126
aVAnd you'll notice that he's struggling  with stability as he's walking.
p127
aVAnd something that's not obvious, that you can't see,
p128
aVis that it's psychologically draining
p129
aVto walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.
p130
aVNow this is a video of Kamal.
p131
aVYou remember Kamal earlier, holding the bamboo staff.
p132
aVHe's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee,
p133
aVand he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.
p134
aVAnd you can see his stability is much better.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo world class isn't just about technical performance.
p137
aVIt's also about human performance.
p138
aVAnd most medical devices, we've learned,
p139
aVas we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners,
p140
aVfor wealthier economies.
p141
aVBut the reality is our users, our customers,
p142
aVthey do different things. They sit cross-legged more.
p143
aVWe see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.
p144
aVAnd we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion
p145
aVof almost any other knee on the market.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo the second thing we learned, and this leads
p148
aVinto my second point, which is that we believe
p149
aVthat products need to be designed to be user-centric.
p150
aVAnd at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say
p151
aVyou need to be user-obsessed.
p152
aVSo it's not just the end user that you're thinking about,
p153
aVbut everyone who interacts with the product,
p154
aVso, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee,
p155
aVbut also the context in which the knee is being fit.
p156
aVWhat is the local market like?
p157
aVHow do all these components get to the clinic?
p158
aVDo they all get there on time? The supply chain.
p159
aVEverything that goes into ensuring
p160
aVthat this product gets to the end user,
p161
aVand it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo I wanted to show you some of the iterations
p164
aVwe did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee,
p165
aVso this is it right here.
p166
aV(Clicking)
p167
aVNotice anything about it?
p168
aVIt clicks.
p169
aVWe'd seen that users had actually modified it.
p170
aVSo do you see that black strip right there?
p171
aVThat's a homemade noise dampener.
p172
aVWe also saw that our users had modified it
p173
aVin other ways.
p174
aVYou can see there that that particular amputee,
p175
aVhe had wrapped bandages around the knee.
p176
aVHe'd made a cosmesis.
p177
aVAnd if you look at the knee,
p178
aVit's got those pointy edges, right?
p179
aVSo if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt
p180
aVor a sari, it's really obvious
p181
aVthat you're wearing a prosthetic limb,
p182
aVand in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled,
p183
aVpeople are particularly acute about this.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did.
p186
aVWe did a lot of iterations, not just  around this, but some other things.
p187
aVBut here we have the version three,  the ReMotion Knee,
p188
aVbut if you look in here, you can see
p189
aVthe noise dampener. It's quieter.
p190
aVThe other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile.
p191
aVWe made it thinner.
p192
aVAnd something that's not obvious is that we
p193
aVdesigned it for mass production.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd this goes into my last point.
p196
aVWe really, truly believe that if a product
p197
aVis going to reach users at the scale that it's needed,
p198
aVit needs to be market-driven,
p199
aVand market-driven means that products are sold.
p200
aVThey're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.
p201
aVOur product needs to be designed to offer value
p202
aVto the end user.
p203
aVIt also has to be designed to be very affordable.
p204
aVBut a product that is valued by a customer
p205
aVis used by a customer,
p206
aVand use is what creates impact.
p207
aVAnd we believe that as designers,
p208
aVit holds us accountable to our customers.
p209
aVAnd with centralized manufacturing,
p210
aVyou can control the quality control,
p211
aVand you can hit that $80 price point
p212
aVwith profit margins built in.
p213
aVAnd now, those profit margins are critical,
p214
aVbecause if you want to scale, if you want to reach
p215
aVall the people in the world who possibly need a knee,
p216
aVit needs to be economically sustainable.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo I want to give you a sense of where we are at.
p219
aVWe have fit over 5,000 amputees,
p220
aVand one of the big indicators we're looking at, of course,
p221
aVis, does it improve lives?
p222
aVWell, the standard is, is someone
p223
aVstill wearing their knee six months later?
p224
aVThe industry average is about 65 percent.
p225
aVOurs is 79 percent,
p226
aVand we're hoping to get that higher.
p227
aVRight now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.
p228
aVThis is where we want to get, though,
p229
aVin the next three years.
p230
aVWe'll double the impact in 2015,
p231
aVand we'll double it each of the following years after that.
p232
aVBut then we hit a new challenge,
p233
aVand that's the number of skilled prosthetists
p234
aVwho are able to fit knees.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo I want to end with a story of Pournima.
p237
aVPournima was 18 years old
p238
aVwhen she was in a car accident where she lost her leg,
p239
aVand she traveled 12 hours by train
p240
aVto come to the clinic to be fit with a knee,
p241
aVand while all of the amputees who wear our knees
p242
aVaffect us as the designers,
p243
aVshe's particularly meaningful to me  as an engineer and as a woman,
p244
aVbecause she was in school,
p245
aVshe had just started school to study engineering.
p246
aVAnd she said, "Well, now that I can walk again,
p247
aVI can go back and complete my studies."
p248
aVAnd to me she represents the next generation
p249
aVof engineers solving problems
p250
aVand ensuring meaningful technologies
p251
aVreach their users.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo thank you.
p254

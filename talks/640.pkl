VMy name is Jonathan Zittrain,
p5
aVand in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist.
p6
aVSo I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist,
p7
aVand give reason to hope
p8
aVfor the future of the Internet
p9
aVby drawing upon its present.
p10
aa(lp11
VNow, it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before.
p12
aVPeople are less kind. There is less trust around.
p13
aVI don't know. As a simple example,
p14
aVwe could run a test here.
p15
aVHow many people have ever hitchhiked?
p16
aVI know. How many people have hitchhiked
p17
aVwithin the past 10 years?
p18
aVRight. So what has changed?
p19
aVIt's not better public transportation.
p20
aVSo that's one reason to think that we might be
p21
aVdeclensionists, going in the wrong direction.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut I want to give you three examples
p24
aVto try to say that the trend line
p25
aVis in fact in the other direction,
p26
aVand it's the Internet helping it along.
p27
aVSo example number one: the Internet itself.
p28
aVThese are three of the founders of the Internet.
p29
aVThey were actually high school classmates together
p30
aVat the same high school in suburban Los Angles in the 1960s.
p31
aVYou might have had a French club or a Debate club.
p32
aVThey had a "Let's build a global network" club,
p33
aVand it worked out very well.
p34
aa(lp35
VThey are pictured here for their 25th anniversary
p36
aVNewsweek retrospective on the Internet.
p37
aVAnd as you can tell,
p38
aVthey are basically goof balls.
p39
aVThey had one great limitation
p40
aVand one great freedom
p41
aVas they tried to conceive of a global network.
p42
aVThe limitation was that they didn't have any money.
p43
aVNo particular amount of capital to invest,
p44
aVof the sort that for a physical network
p45
aVyou might need for trucks and people
p46
aVand a hub to move packages around overnight.
p47
aVThey had none of that.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut they had an amazing freedom,
p50
aVwhich was they didn't have to make any money from it.
p51
aVThe Internet has no business plan, never did.
p52
aVNo CEO,
p53
aVno firm responsible, singly, for building it.
p54
aVInstead, it's folks getting together
p55
aVto do something for fun,
p56
aVrather than because they were told to,
p57
aVor because they were expecting to make a mint off of it.
p58
aa(lp59
VThat ethos led to a network architecture,
p60
aVa structure that was unlike
p61
aVother digital networks then or since.
p62
aVSo unusual, in fact,
p63
aVthat it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work.
p64
aVAs late as 1992, IBM was known to say
p65
aVyou couldn't possibly build a corporate network
p66
aVusing Internet Protocol.
p67
aVAnd even some Internet engineers today say
p68
aVthe whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VThat's why the mascot of Internet engineering,
p72
aVif it had one, is said to be the bumblebee.
p73
aVBecause the fur-to-wingspan ratio of the bumblebee
p74
aVis far too large for it to be able to fly.
p75
aVAnd yet, mysteriously, somehow the bee flies.
p76
aVI'm pleased to say that, thanks to massive government funding,
p77
aVabout three years ago we finally figured out
p78
aVhow bees fly.
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aVIt's very complicated, but it turns out they
p81
aVflap their wings very quickly.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VSo what is this bizarre architecture configuration
p85
aVthat makes the network sing and be so unusual?
p86
aVWell, to move data around
p87
aVfrom one place to another \u2014 again, it's not like a package courier.
p88
aVIt's more like a mosh pit.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVImagine, you being part of a network
p91
aVwhere, you're maybe at a sporting event,
p92
aVand you're sitting in rows like this,
p93
aVand somebody asks for a beer,
p94
aVand it gets handed at the aisle.
p95
aVAnd your neighborly duty
p96
aVis to pass the beer along,
p97
aVat risk to your own trousers,
p98
aVto get it to the destination.
p99
aa(lp100
VNo one pays you to do this.
p101
aVIt's just part of your neighborly duty.
p102
aVAnd, in a way, that's exactly how packets move around the Internet,
p103
aVsometimes in as many as 25 or 30 hops,
p104
aVwith the intervening entities
p105
aVthat are passing the data around
p106
aVhaving no particular contractual or legal obligation
p107
aVto the original sender
p108
aVor to the receiver.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, of course, in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination.
p111
aVYou need a lot of trust,
p112
aVbut it's not like, "I'm trying to get to Pensacola, please."
p113
aVSo the Internet needs addressing and directions.
p114
aVIt turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet.
p115
aVInstead, again, it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater,
p116
aVbut we can only see amidst the fog
p117
aVthe people immediately around us.
p118
aVSo what do we do to figure out who is where?
p119
aVWe turn to the person on the right,
p120
aVand we tell that person what we see on our left,
p121
aVand vice versa.
p122
aVAnd they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it,
p123
aVyou have a general sense of where everything is.
p124
aa(lp125
VThis is how Internet addressing and routing actually work.
p126
aVThis is a system that relies on kindness and trust,
p127
aVwhich also makes it very delicate and vulnerable.
p128
aVIn rare but striking instances,
p129
aVa single lie told by just one entity
p130
aVin this honeycomb
p131
aVcan lead to real trouble.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo, for example, last year,
p134
aVthe government of Pakistan
p135
aVasked its Internet service providers there
p136
aVto prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube.
p137
aVThere was a video there that the government did not like
p138
aVand they wanted to make sure it was blocked.
p139
aVThis is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere
p140
aVare often trying to block
p141
aVand filter and censor content on the Internet.
p142
aa(lp143
VWell this one ISP in Pakistan
p144
aVchose to effectuate the block for its subscribers
p145
aVin a rather unusual way.
p146
aVIt advertised \u2014
p147
aVthe way that you might be asked, if you were part of the Internet,
p148
aVto declare what you see near you \u2014 it advertised
p149
aVthat near it, in fact, it had suddenly awakened to find
p150
aVthat it was YouTube.
p151
aV"That's right," it said, "I am YouTube."
p152
aVWhich meant that packets of data
p153
aVfrom subscribers going to YouTube
p154
aVstopped at the ISP, since they thought they were already there,
p155
aVand the ISP threw them away unopened
p156
aVbecause the point was to block it.
p157
aa(lp158
VBut it didn't stop there.
p159
aVYou see, that announcement
p160
aVwent one click out,
p161
aVwhich got reverberated, one click out.
p162
aVAnd it turns out that as you look
p163
aVat the postmortem of this event,
p164
aVyou have at one moment
p165
aVperfectly working YouTube.
p166
aVThen, at moment number two,
p167
aVyou have the fake announcement go out.
p168
aVAnd within two minutes,
p169
aVit reverberates around
p170
aVand YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world.
p171
aVIf you were sitting in Oxford, England, trying to get to YouTube,
p172
aVyour packets were going to Pakistan
p173
aVand they weren't coming back.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow just think about that.
p176
aVOne of the most popular websites in the world,
p177
aVrun by the most powerful company in the world,
p178
aVand there was nothing that YouTube or Google
p179
aVwere particularly privileged to do about it.
p180
aVAnd yet, somehow, within about two hours,
p181
aVthe problem was fixed.
p182
aVHow did this happen?
p183
aa(lp184
VWell, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG.
p185
aVThe North American Network Operators Group,
p186
aVa group of people who,
p187
aVon a beautiful day outside,
p188
aVenter into a windowless room,
p189
aVat their terminals
p190
aVreading email and messages
p191
aVin fixed proportion font, like this,
p192
aVand they talk about networks.
p193
aVAnd some of them are mid-level employees at Internet service providers
p194
aVaround the world.
p195
aVAnd here is the message where one of them says,
p196
aV"Looks like we've got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube!
p197
aVThis is not a drill. It's not just the cluelessness
p198
aVof YouTube engineers. I promise.
p199
aVSomething is up in Pakistan."
p200
aVAnd they came together to help find the problem and fix it.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo it's kind of like if your house catches on fire.
p203
aVThe bad news is there is no fire brigade.
p204
aVThe good news is random people apparate from nowhere,
p205
aVput out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise.
p206
aV(Applause)
p207
aVI was trying to think of the right model to describe
p208
aVthis form of random acts of kindness
p209
aVby geeky strangers.
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVYou know, it's just like the hail goes out
p212
aVand people are ready to help.
p213
aVAnd it turns out this model is everywhere, once you start looking for it.
p214
aa(lp215
VExample number two: Wikipedia.
p216
aVIf a man named Jimbo came up to you in 2001
p217
aVand said, "I've got a great idea! We start with seven articles
p218
aVthat anybody can edit anything, at any time,
p219
aVand we'll get a great encyclopedia! Eh?"
p220
aVRight. Dumbest idea ever.
p221
aV(Laughter)
p222
aVIn fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid
p223
aVthat even Jimbo never had it.
p224
aa(lp225
VJimbo's idea was for Nupedia.
p226
aVIt was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money
p227
aVbecause he was feeling like a good guy,
p228
aVand the money would go to the people
p229
aVand they would write the articles.
p230
aVThe wiki was introduced
p231
aVso others could make suggestions on edits \u2014
p232
aVas almost an afterthought, a back room.
p233
aVAnd then it turns out the back room grew
p234
aVto encompass the entire project.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd today, Wikipedia is so ubiquitous
p237
aVthat you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus.
p238
aV(Laughter)
p239
aVI am not making this up.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVI have a theory I can explain later.
p242
aVSuffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia
p243
aVstir-fried with pimentos.
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VBut now, Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work.
p247
aVHow does it really work? It turns out
p248
aVthere is a back room that is kind of windowless,
p249
aVmetaphorically speaking.
p250
aVAnd there are a bunch of people who, on a sunny day,
p251
aVwould rather be inside
p252
aVand monitoring this, the administrator's notice board,
p253
aVitself a wiki page that anyone can edit.
p254
aVAnd you just bring your problems to the page.
p255
aVIt's reminiscent of the description of history
p256
aVas "one damn thing after another," right?
p257
aa(lp258
VNumber one: "Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil."
p259
aVApologies, Andyvphil, if you're here today.
p260
aVI'm not taking sides.
p261
aV"Anon attacking me for reverting."
p262
aVHere is my favorite: "A long story."
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aVIt turns out there are more people checking this page for problems
p265
aVand wanting to solve them
p266
aVthan there are problems arising on the page.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd that's what keeps Wikipedia afloat.
p269
aVAt all times, Wikipedia is approximately
p270
aV45 minutes away from utter destruction. Right?
p271
aVThere are spambots crawling it, trying to turn every article
p272
aVinto an ad for a Rolex watch.
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVIt's this thin geeky line
p275
aVthat keeps it going.
p276
aVNot because it's a job,
p277
aVnot because it's a career,
p278
aVbut because it's a calling.
p279
aVIt's something they feel impelled to do
p280
aVbecause they care about it.
p281
aa(lp282
VThey even gather together in such groups
p283
aVas the Counter-Vandalism Unit \u2014
p284
aV"Civility, Maturity, Responsibility" \u2014
p285
aVto just clean up the pages.
p286
aVIt does make you wonder if there were, for instance,
p287
aVa massive, extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend,
p288
aVwho would be minding the store?
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VSo what we see \u2014
p292
aV(Laughter)
p293
aVwhat we see in this phenomenon
p294
aVis something that the crazed, late traffic engineer
p295
aVHans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands,
p296
aVand here in South Kensington, that sometimes
p297
aVif you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else,
p298
aVyou can actually end up
p299
aVwith a safer environment in which people can function,
p300
aVand one in which they are more human with each other.
p301
aVThey're realizing that they
p302
aVhave to take responsibility for what they do.
p303
aVAnd Wikipedia has embraced this.
p304
aa(lp305
VSome of you may remember Star Wars Kid,
p306
aVthe poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever,
p307
aVacting as if it were a light saber.
p308
aVThe film, without his permission or even knowledge at first,
p309
aVfound its way onto the Internet.
p310
aVHugely viral video. Extremely popular.
p311
aVTotally mortifying to him.
p312
aa(lp313
VNow, it being encyclopedic and all,
p314
aVWikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid.
p315
aVEvery article on Wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page,
p316
aVand on the discussion page
p317
aVthey had extensive argument among the Wikipedians
p318
aVas to whether to have his real name
p319
aVfeatured in the article.
p320
aVYou could see arguments on both sides.
p321
aVHere is just a snapshot of some of them.
p322
aVThey eventually decided \u2014
p323
aVnot unanimously by any means \u2014
p324
aVnot to include his real name,
p325
aVdespite the fact that nearly all media reports did.
p326
aVThey just didn't think it was the right thing to do.
p327
aVIt was an act of kindness.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd to this day, the page for Star Wars Kid
p330
aVhas a warning right at the top
p331
aVthat says you are not to put his real name on the page.
p332
aVIf you do, it will be removed immediately,
p333
aVremoved by people who may have disagreed with the original decision,
p334
aVbut respect the outcome
p335
aVand work to make it stay
p336
aVbecause they believe in something bigger than their own opinion.
p337
aVAs a lawyer, I've got to say these guys are inventing the law
p338
aVand stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along.
p339
aa(lp340
VNow, this isn't just limited to Wikipedia.
p341
aVWe see it on blogs all over the place.
p342
aVI mean, this is a 2005 Business Week cover.
p343
aVWow. Blogs are going to change your business.
p344
aVI know they look silly. And sure they look silly.
p345
aVThey start off on all sorts of goofy projects.
p346
aa(lp347
VThis is my favorite goofy blog:
p348
aVCatsthatlooklikehitler.com.
p349
aV(Laughter)
p350
aVYou send in a picture of your cat
p351
aVif it looks like Hitler.
p352
aV(Laughter)
p353
aVYeah, I know. Number four, it's like, can you imagine
p354
aVcoming home to that cat everyday?
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VBut then, you can see the same kind of whimsy
p358
aVapplied to people.
p359
aVSo this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture.
p360
aVThis one says, "Bucolic meadow with split-rail fence.
p361
aVIs that an animal carcass behind her?"
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aVYou're like, "You know? I think that's an animal carcass
p364
aVbehind her."
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd it's one after the other.
p367
aVBut then you hit this one. Image removed at request of owner.
p368
aVThat's it. Image removed at request of owner.
p369
aVIt turns out that somebody lampooned here
p370
aVwrote to the snarky guy that does the site,
p371
aVnot with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment,
p372
aVbut just said, "Hey, would you mind?"
p373
aVThe person said, "No, that's fine."
p374
aa(lp375
VI believe we can build architectures online
p376
aVto make such human requests
p377
aVthat much easier to do,
p378
aVto make it possible for all of us to see
p379
aVthat the data we encounter online
p380
aVis just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward
p381
aVthat actually represents human emotion
p382
aVand endeavor and impact,
p383
aVand to be able to have an ethical moment
p384
aVwhere we decide how we want to treat it.
p385
aa(lp386
VI even think it can go into the real world.
p387
aVWe can end up, as we get in a world with more censors \u2014
p388
aVeverywhere there is something filming you, maybe putting it online \u2014
p389
aVto be able to have a little clip you could wear
p390
aVthat says, "You know, I'd rather not."
p391
aVAnd then have technology
p392
aVthat the person taking the photo will know later,
p393
aVthis person requested to be contacted
p394
aVbefore this goes anywhere big,
p395
aVif you don't mind.
p396
aVAnd that person taking the photo can make a decision
p397
aVabout how and whether to respect it.
p398
aa(lp399
VIn the real world, we see filtering of this sort
p400
aVtaking place in Pakistan.
p401
aVAnd we now have means that we can build, like this system,
p402
aVso that people can report the filtering as they encounter it.
p403
aVAnd it's no longer just a "I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on,"
p404
aVbut suddenly a collective consciousness
p405
aVabout what is blocked and censored
p406
aVwhere online.
p407
aVIn fact, talk about technology imitating life
p408
aVimitating tech, or maybe it's the other way around.
p409
aa(lp410
VAn NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots
p411
aVwith smiley faces on them,
p412
aVand a motor that just drove them forward
p413
aVand a flag sticking out the back
p414
aVwith a desired destination.
p415
aVIt said, "Can you help me get there?"
p416
aVReleased it on the streets of Manhattan.
p417
aV(Laughter)
p418
aVThey'll fund anything these days.
p419
aVHere is the chart of over 43 people
p420
aVhelping to steer the robot that could not steer
p421
aVand get it on its way, from one corner
p422
aVfrom one corner of Washington Square Park
p423
aVto another.
p424
aa(lp425
VThat leads to example number three: hitchhiking.
p426
aVI'm not so sure hitchhiking is dead.
p427
aVWhy? There is the Craigslist rideshare board.
p428
aVIf it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board,
p429
aVtumbleweeds would be blowing through it.
p430
aVBut it's the rideshare board, and it's basically the same thing.
p431
aVNow why are people using it?
p432
aVI don't know. Maybe they think that, uh, killers don't plan ahead?
p433
aV(Laughter)
p434
aVNo. I think the actual answer is
p435
aVthat once you reframe it,
p436
aVonce you get out of one set of stale expectations
p437
aVfrom a failed project that had its day,
p438
aVbut now, for whatever reason, is tarnished,
p439
aVyou can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing
p440
aVthat something like this on Craigslist represents.
p441
aa(lp442
VAnd then you can highlight it
p443
aVinto something like,
p444
aVyes, CouchSurfing.org.
p445
aVCouchSurfing: one guy's idea
p446
aVto, at last, put together people who are going somewhere far away
p447
aVand would like to sleep on a stranger's couch for free,
p448
aVwith people who live far away,
p449
aVand would like someone they don't know to sleep on their couch for free.
p450
aVIt's a brilliant idea.
p451
aVIt's a bee that, yes, flies.
p452
aa(lp453
VAmazing how many successful couch surfings there have been.
p454
aVAnd if you're wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities
p455
aVassociated with CouchSurfing.
p456
aVAlthough, to be sure, the reputation system, at the moment,
p457
aVworks that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience,
p458
aVso there may be some selection bias there.
p459
aV(Laughter)
p460
aa(lp461
VSo, my urging, my thought,
p462
aVis that the Internet isn't just a pile of information.
p463
aVIt's not a noun. It's a verb.
p464
aVAnd when you go on it,
p465
aVif you listen and see carefully and closely enough,
p466
aVwhat you will discover
p467
aVis that that information

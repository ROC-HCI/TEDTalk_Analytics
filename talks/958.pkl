VFor the last 10 years, I've been spending my time trying to figure out
p5
aVhow and why human beings
p6
aVassemble themselves into social networks.
p7
aVAnd the kind of social network I'm talking about
p8
aVis not the recent online variety,
p9
aVbut rather, the kind of social networks
p10
aVthat human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years,
p11
aVever since we emerged from the African savannah.
p12
aVSo, I form friendships and co-worker
p13
aVand sibling and relative relationships with other people
p14
aVwho in turn have similar relationships with other people.
p15
aVAnd this spreads on out endlessly into a distance.
p16
aVAnd you get a network that looks like this.
p17
aVEvery dot is a person.
p18
aVEvery line between them is a relationship between two people \u2014
p19
aVdifferent kinds of relationships.
p20
aVAnd you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity,
p21
aVin which we're all embedded.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd my colleague, James Fowler and I have been studying for quite sometime
p24
aVwhat are the mathematical, social,
p25
aVbiological and psychological rules
p26
aVthat govern how these networks are assembled
p27
aVand what are the similar rules
p28
aVthat govern how they operate, how they affect our lives.
p29
aVBut recently, we've been wondering
p30
aVwhether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight,
p31
aVto actually find ways to improve the world,
p32
aVto do something better,
p33
aVto actually fix things, not just understand things.
p34
aVSo one of the first things we thought we would tackle
p35
aVwould be how we go about predicting epidemics.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic \u2014
p38
aVif you're the CDC or some other national body \u2014
p39
aVis to sit in the middle where you are
p40
aVand collect data
p41
aVfrom physicians and laboratories in the field
p42
aVthat report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions.
p43
aVSo, so and so patients have been diagnosed with something,
p44
aVor other patients have been diagnosed,
p45
aVand all these data are fed into a central repository, with some delay.
p46
aVAnd if everything goes smoothly,
p47
aVone to two weeks from now
p48
aVyou'll know where the epidemic was today.
p49
aVAnd actually, about a year or so ago,
p50
aVthere was this promulgation
p51
aVof the idea of Google Flu Trends, with respect to the flu,
p52
aVwhere by looking at people's searching behavior today,
p53
aVwe could know where the flu \u2014
p54
aVwhat the status of the epidemic was today,
p55
aVwhat's the prevalence of the epidemic today.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut what I'd like to show you today
p58
aVis a means by which we might get
p59
aVnot just rapid warning about an epidemic,
p60
aVbut also actually
p61
aVearly detection of an epidemic.
p62
aVAnd, in fact, this idea can be used
p63
aVnot just to predict epidemics of germs,
p64
aVbut also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds.
p65
aVFor example, anything that spreads by a form of social contagion
p66
aVcould be understood in this way,
p67
aVfrom abstract ideas on the left
p68
aVlike patriotism, or altruism, or religion
p69
aVto practices
p70
aVlike dieting behavior, or book purchasing,
p71
aVor drinking, or bicycle-helmet [and] other safety practices,
p72
aVor products that people might buy,
p73
aVpurchases of electronic goods,
p74
aVanything in which there's kind of an interpersonal spread.
p75
aVA kind of a diffusion of innovation
p76
aVcould be understood and predicted
p77
aVby the mechanism I'm going to show you now.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo, as all of you probably know,
p80
aVthe classic way of thinking about this
p81
aVis the diffusion-of-innovation,
p82
aVor the adoption curve.
p83
aVSo here on the Y-axis, we have the percent of the people affected,
p84
aVand on the X-axis, we have time.
p85
aVAnd at the very beginning, not too many people are affected,
p86
aVand you get this classic sigmoidal,
p87
aVor S-shaped, curve.
p88
aVAnd the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning,
p89
aVlet's say one or two people
p90
aVare infected, or affected by the thing
p91
aVand then they affect, or infect, two people,
p92
aVwho in turn affect four, eight, 16 and so forth,
p93
aVand you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve.
p94
aVAnd eventually, you saturate the population.
p95
aVThere are fewer and fewer people
p96
aVwho are still available that you might infect,
p97
aVand then you get the plateau of the curve,
p98
aVand you get this classic sigmoidal curve.
p99
aVAnd this holds for germs, ideas,
p100
aVproduct adoption, behaviors,
p101
aVand the like.
p102
aVBut things don't just diffuse in human populations at random.
p103
aVThey actually diffuse through networks.
p104
aVBecause, as I said, we live our lives in networks,
p105
aVand these networks have a particular kind of a structure.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow if you look at a network like this \u2014
p108
aVthis is 105 people.
p109
aVAnd the lines represent \u2014 the dots are the people,
p110
aVand the lines represent friendship relationships.
p111
aVYou might see that people occupy
p112
aVdifferent locations within the network.
p113
aVAnd there are different kinds of relationships between the people.
p114
aVYou could have friendship relationships, sibling relationships,
p115
aVspousal relationships, co-worker relationships,
p116
aVneighbor relationships and the like.
p117
aVAnd different sorts of things
p118
aVspread across different sorts of ties.
p119
aVFor instance, sexually transmitted diseases
p120
aVwill spread across sexual ties.
p121
aVOr, for instance, people's smoking behavior
p122
aVmight be influenced by their friends.
p123
aVOr their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior
p124
aVmight be influenced by their coworkers,
p125
aVor by their neighbors.
p126
aVBut not all positions in the network are the same.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo if you look at this, you might immediately grasp
p129
aVthat different people have different numbers of connections.
p130
aVSome people have one connection, some have two,
p131
aVsome have six, some have 10 connections.
p132
aVAnd this is called the "degree" of a node,
p133
aVor the number of connections that a node has.
p134
aVBut in addition, there's something else.
p135
aVSo, if you look at nodes A and B,
p136
aVthey both have six connections.
p137
aVBut if you can see this image [of the network] from a bird's eye view,
p138
aVyou can appreciate that there's something very different
p139
aVabout nodes A and B.
p140
aVSo, let me ask you this \u2014 I can cultivate this intuition by asking a question \u2014
p141
aVwho would you rather be
p142
aVif a deadly germ was spreading through the network, A or B?
p143
aV(Audience: B.) Nicholas Christakis: B, it's obvious.
p144
aVB is located on the edge of the network.
p145
aVNow, who would you rather be
p146
aVif a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network?
p147
aVA. And you have an immediate appreciation
p148
aVthat A is going to be more likely
p149
aVto get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner
p150
aVby virtue of their structural location within the network.
p151
aVA, in fact, is more central,
p152
aVand this can be formalized mathematically.
p153
aVSo, if we want to track something
p154
aVthat was spreading through a network,
p155
aVwhat we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors
p156
aVon the central individuals within the network,
p157
aVincluding node A,
p158
aVmonitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network,
p159
aVand somehow get an early detection
p160
aVof whatever it is that is spreading through the network.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information,
p163
aVyou would know that, soon enough,
p164
aVeverybody was about to contract this germ
p165
aVor this piece of information.
p166
aVAnd this would be much better
p167
aVthan monitoring six randomly chosen people,
p168
aVwithout reference to the structure of the population.
p169
aVAnd in fact, if you could do that,
p170
aVwhat you would see is something like this.
p171
aVOn the left-hand panel, again, we have the S-shaped curve of adoption.
p172
aVIn the dotted red line, we show
p173
aVwhat the adoption would be in the random people,
p174
aVand in the left-hand line, shifted to the left,
p175
aVwe show what the adoption would be
p176
aVin the central individuals within the network.
p177
aVOn the Y-axis is the cumulative instances of contagion,
p178
aVand on the X-axis is the time.
p179
aVAnd on the right-hand side, we show the same data,
p180
aVbut here with daily incidence.
p181
aVAnd what we show here is \u2014 like, here \u2014
p182
aVvery few people are affected, more and more and more and up to here,
p183
aVand here's the peak of the epidemic.
p184
aVBut shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals.
p185
aVAnd this difference in time between the two
p186
aVis the early detection, the early warning we can get,
p187
aVabout an impending epidemic
p188
aVin the human population.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe problem, however,
p191
aVis that mapping human social networks
p192
aVis not always possible.
p193
aVIt can be expensive, not feasible,
p194
aVunethical,
p195
aVor, frankly, just not possible to do such a thing.
p196
aVSo, how can we figure out
p197
aVwho the central people are in a network
p198
aVwithout actually mapping the network?
p199
aVWhat we came up with
p200
aVwas an idea to exploit an old fact,
p201
aVor a known fact, about social networks,
p202
aVwhich goes like this:
p203
aVDo you know that your friends
p204
aVhave more friends than you do?
p205
aVYour friends have more friends than you do,
p206
aVand this is known as the friendship paradox.
p207
aVImagine a very popular person in the social network \u2014
p208
aVlike a party host who has hundreds of friends \u2014
p209
aVand a misanthrope who has just one friend,
p210
aVand you pick someone at random from the population;
p211
aVthey were much more likely to know the party host.
p212
aVAnd if they nominate the party host as their friend,
p213
aVthat party host has a hundred friends,
p214
aVtherefore, has more friends than they do.
p215
aVAnd this, in essence, is what's known as the friendship paradox.
p216
aVThe friends of randomly chosen people
p217
aVhave higher degree, and are more central
p218
aVthan the random people themselves.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd you can get an intuitive appreciation for this
p221
aVif you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network.
p222
aVIf you pick this person,
p223
aVthe only friend they have to nominate is this person,
p224
aVwho, by construction, must have at least two
p225
aVand typically more friends.
p226
aVAnd that happens at every peripheral node.
p227
aVAnd in fact, it happens throughout the network as you move in,
p228
aVeveryone you pick, when they nominate a random \u2014
p229
aVwhen a random person nominates a friend of theirs,
p230
aVyou move closer to the center of the network.
p231
aVSo, we thought we would exploit this idea
p232
aVin order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks.
p233
aVBecause now, with this idea
p234
aVwe can take a random sample of people,
p235
aVhave them nominate their friends,
p236
aVthose friends would be more central,
p237
aVand we could do this without having to map the network.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd we tested this idea with an outbreak of H1N1 flu
p240
aVat Harvard College
p241
aVin the fall and winter of 2009, just a few months ago.
p242
aVWe took 1,300 randomly selected undergraduates,
p243
aVwe had them nominate their friends,
p244
aVand we followed both the random students and their friends
p245
aVdaily in time
p246
aVto see whether or not they had the flu epidemic.
p247
aVAnd we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services.
p248
aVAnd also, we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week.
p249
aVExactly what we predicted happened.
p250
aVSo the random group is in the red line.
p251
aVThe epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left, over here.
p252
aVAnd the difference in the two is 16 days.
p253
aVBy monitoring the friends group,
p254
aVwe could get 16 days advance warning
p255
aVof an impending epidemic in this human population.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow, in addition to that,
p258
aVif you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic
p259
aVor to predict the adoption of a product, for example,
p260
aVwhat you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population,
p261
aValso have them nominate their friends and follow the friends
p262
aVand follow both the randoms and the friends.
p263
aVAmong the friends, the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero
p264
aVin adoption of the innovation, for example,
p265
aVwould be evidence of an impending epidemic.
p266
aVOr you could see the first time the two curves diverged,
p267
aVas shown on the left.
p268
aVWhen did the randoms \u2014 when did the friends take off
p269
aVand leave the randoms,
p270
aVand [when did] their curve start shifting?
p271
aVAnd that, as indicated by the white line,
p272
aVoccurred 46 days
p273
aVbefore the peak of the epidemic.
p274
aVSo this would be a technique
p275
aVwhereby we could get more than a month-and-a-half warning
p276
aVabout a flu epidemic in a particular population.
p277
aa(lp278
VI should say that
p279
aVhow far advanced a notice one might get about something
p280
aVdepends on a host of factors.
p281
aVIt could depend on the nature of the pathogen \u2014
p282
aVdifferent pathogens,
p283
aVusing this technique, you'd get different warning \u2014
p284
aVor other phenomena that are spreading,
p285
aVor frankly, on the structure of the human network.
p286
aVNow in our case, although it wasn't necessary,
p287
aVwe could also actually map the network of the students.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo, this is a map of 714 students
p290
aVand their friendship ties.
p291
aVAnd in a minute now, I'm going to put this map into motion.
p292
aVWe're going to take daily cuts through the network
p293
aVfor 120 days.
p294
aVThe red dots are going to be cases of the flu,
p295
aVand the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu.
p296
aVAnd the size of the dots is going to be proportional
p297
aVto how many of their friends have the flu.
p298
aVSo bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu.
p299
aVAnd if you look at this image \u2014 here we are now in September the 13th \u2014
p300
aVyou're going to see a few cases light up.
p301
aVYou're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle.
p302
aVHere we are on October the 19th.
p303
aVThe slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now, in November.
p304
aVBang, bang, bang, bang, bang \u2014 you're going to see lots of blooming in the middle,
p305
aVand then you're going to see a sort of leveling off,
p306
aVfewer and fewer cases towards the end of December.
p307
aVAnd this type of a visualization
p308
aVcan show that epidemics like this take root
p309
aVand affect central individuals first,
p310
aVbefore they affect others.
p311
aa(lp312
VNow, as I've been suggesting,
p313
aVthis method is not restricted to germs,
p314
aVbut actually to anything that spreads in populations.
p315
aVInformation spreads in populations,
p316
aVnorms can spread in populations,
p317
aVbehaviors can spread in populations.
p318
aVAnd by behaviors, I can mean things like criminal behavior,
p319
aVor voting behavior, or health care behavior,
p320
aVlike smoking, or vaccination,
p321
aVor product adoption, or other kinds of behaviors
p322
aVthat relate to interpersonal influence.
p323
aVIf I'm likely to do something that affects others around me,
p324
aVthis technique can get early warning or early detection
p325
aVabout the adoption within the population.
p326
aVThe key thing is that for it to work,
p327
aVthere has to be interpersonal influence.
p328
aVIt cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism
p329
aVaffecting everyone uniformly.
p330
aa(lp331
VNow the same insights
p332
aVcan also be exploited \u2014 with respect to networks \u2014
p333
aVcan also be exploited in other ways,
p334
aVfor example, in the use of targeting
p335
aVspecific people for interventions.
p336
aVSo, for example, most of you are probably familiar
p337
aVwith the notion of herd immunity.
p338
aVSo, if we have a population of a thousand people,
p339
aVand we want to make the population immune to a pathogen,
p340
aVwe don't have to immunize every single person.
p341
aVIf we immunize 960 of them,
p342
aVit's as if we had immunized a hundred [percent] of them.
p343
aVBecause even if one or two of the non-immune people gets infected,
p344
aVthere's no one for them to infect.
p345
aVThey are surrounded by immunized people.
p346
aVSo 96 percent is as good as 100 percent.
p347
aVWell, some other scientists have estimated
p348
aVwhat would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample
p349
aVof these 1000 people, 300 people and immunized them.
p350
aVWould you get any population-level immunity?
p351
aVAnd the answer is no.
p352
aVBut if you took this 30 percent, these 300 people
p353
aVand had them nominate their friends
p354
aVand took the same number of vaccine doses
p355
aVand vaccinated the friends of the 300 \u2014
p356
aVthe 300 friends \u2014
p357
aVyou can get the same level of herd immunity
p358
aVas if you had vaccinated 96 percent of the population
p359
aVat a much greater efficiency, with a strict budget constraint.
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd similar ideas can be used, for instance,
p362
aVto target distribution of things like bed nets
p363
aVin the developing world.
p364
aVIf we could understand the structure of networks in villages,
p365
aVwe could target to whom to give the interventions
p366
aVto foster these kinds of spreads.
p367
aVOr, frankly, for advertising with all kinds of products.
p368
aVIf we could understand how to target,
p369
aVit could affect the efficiency
p370
aVof what we're trying to achieve.
p371
aVAnd in fact, we can use data
p372
aVfrom all kinds of sources nowadays [to do this].
p373
aa(lp374
VThis is a map of eight million phone users
p375
aVin a European country.
p376
aVEvery dot is a person, and every line represents
p377
aVa volume of calls between the people.
p378
aVAnd we can use such data, that's being passively obtained,
p379
aVto map these whole countries
p380
aVand understand who is located where within the network.
p381
aVWithout actually having to query them at all,
p382
aVwe can get this kind of a structural insight.
p383
aVAnd other sources of information, as you're no doubt aware
p384
aVare available about such features, from email interactions,
p385
aVonline interactions,
p386
aVonline social networks and so forth.
p387
aVAnd in fact, we are in the era of what I would call
p388
aV"massive-passive" data collection efforts.
p389
aVThey're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data
p390
aVto create sensor networks
p391
aVto follow the population,
p392
aVunderstand what's happening in the population,
p393
aVand intervene in the population for the better.
p394
aVBecause these new technologies tell us
p395
aVnot just who is talking to whom,
p396
aVbut where everyone is,
p397
aVand what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet,
p398
aVand what they're buying based on their purchases.
p399
aVAnd all this administrative data can be pulled together
p400
aVand processed to understand human behavior
p401
aVin a way we never could before.
p402
aa(lp403
VSo, for example, we could use truckers' purchases of fuel.
p404
aVSo the truckers are just going about their business,
p405
aVand they're buying fuel.
p406
aVAnd we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel,
p407
aVand we know that a recession is about to end.
p408
aVOr we can monitor the velocity
p409
aVwith which people are moving with their phones on a highway,
p410
aVand the phone company can see,
p411
aVas the velocity is slowing down,
p412
aVthat there's a traffic jam.
p413
aVAnd they can feed that information back to their subscribers,
p414
aVbut only to their subscribers on the same highway
p415
aVlocated behind the traffic jam!
p416
aVOr we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors, passively,
p417
aVand see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals
p418
aVoccurs within [networks of] doctors.
p419
aVOr again, we can monitor purchasing behavior in people
p420
aVand watch how these types of phenomena
p421
aVcan diffuse within human populations.
p422
aa(lp423
VAnd there are three ways, I think,
p424
aVthat these massive-passive data can be used.
p425
aVOne is fully passive,
p426
aVlike I just described \u2014
p427
aVas in, for instance, the trucker example,
p428
aVwhere we don't actually intervene in the population in any way.
p429
aVOne is quasi-active,
p430
aVlike the flu example I gave,
p431
aVwhere we get some people to nominate their friends
p432
aVand then passively monitor their friends \u2014
p433
aVdo they have the flu, or not? \u2014 and then get warning.
p434
aVOr another example would be,
p435
aVif you're a phone company, you figure out who's central in the network
p436
aVand you ask those people, "Look, will you just text us your fever every day?
p437
aVJust text us your temperature."
p438
aVAnd collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature,
p439
aVbut from centrally located individuals.
p440

p441
aVto monitor an impending epidemic

aVwith very minimal input from people.
p443
aVOr, finally, it can be more fully active \u2014
p444
aVas I know subsequent speakers will also talk about today \u2014
p445
aVwhere people might globally participate in wikis,
p446
aVor photographing, or monitoring elections,
p447
aVand upload information in a way that allows us to pool
p448
aVinformation in order to understand social processes
p449
aVand social phenomena.

VIn fact, the availability of these data, I think,
p452
aVheralds a kind of new era
p453
aVof what I and others would like to call
p454
aV"computational social science."
p455
aVIt's sort of like when Galileo invented \u2014 or, didn't invent \u2014
p456
aVcame to use a telescope
p457
aVand could see the heavens in a new way,
p458
aVor Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope \u2014
p459
aVor actually invented \u2014
p460
aVand could see biology in a new way.
p461
aVBut now we have access to these kinds of data
p462
aVthat allow us to understand social processes
p463
aVand social phenomena
p464
aVin an entirely new way that was never before possible.
p465
aVAnd with this science, we can
p466
aVunderstand how exactly
p467
aVthe whole comes to be greater
p468
aVthan the sum of its parts.
p469
aVAnd actually, we can use these insights
p470
aVto improve society and improve human well-being.

VDo you know
p5
aVhow many species of flowering plants there are?
p6
aVThere are a quarter of a million \u2014 at least those are the ones we know about \u2014
p7
aVa quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
p8
aVAnd flowers are a real bugger.
p9
aVThey're really difficult for plants to produce.
p10
aVThey take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
p11
aVWhy would they go to that bother?
p12
aVAnd the answer of course, like so many things in the world,
p13
aVis sex.
p14
aVI know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.
p15
aVAnd the reason that sexual reproduction is so important \u2014
p16
aVthere are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.
p17
aVYou can take cuttings;
p18
aVthey can sort of have sex with themselves;
p19
aVthey can pollinate themselves.
p20
aVBut they really need to spread their genes
p21
aVto mix with other genes
p22
aVso that they can adapt to environmental niches.
p23
aVEvolution works that way.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow the way that plants transmit that information
p26
aVis through pollen.
p27
aVSome of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
p28
aVAs I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope
p29
aVto be able to see these.
p30
aVAnd there is as many different kinds of pollen
p31
aVas there are flowering plants.
p32
aVAnd that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.
p33
aVMost pollen that causes hay fever for us
p34
aVis from plants that use the wind
p35
aVto disseminate the pollen,
p36
aVand that's a very inefficient process,
p37
aVwhich is why it gets up our noses so much.
p38
aVBecause you have to chuck out masses and masses of it,
p39
aVhoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells,
p40
aVwhich are held within the pollen,
p41
aVwill somehow reach another flower just by chance.
p42
aVSo all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops,
p43
aVand most of the trees
p44
aVhave wind-borne pollen.
p45
aVBut most species
p46
aVactually use insects to do their bidding,
p47
aVand that's more intelligent in a way,
p48
aVbecause the pollen, they don't need so much of it.
p49
aVThe insects
p50
aVand other species
p51
aVcan take the pollen,
p52
aVtransfer it directly to where it's required.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo we're aware, obviously, of the relationship
p55
aVbetween insects and plants.
p56
aVThere's a symbiotic relationship there,
p57
aVwhether it's flies or birds or bees,
p58
aVthey're getting something in return,
p59
aVand that something in return is generally nectar.
p60
aVSometimes that symbiosis
p61
aVhas led to wonderful adaptations \u2014
p62
aVthe hummingbird hawk-moth
p63
aVis beautiful in its adaptation.
p64
aVThe plant gets something,
p65
aVand the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
p66
aVPlants have evolved
p67
aVto create little landing strips here and there
p68
aVfor bees that might have lost their way.
p69
aVThere are markings on many plants
p70
aVthat look like other insects.
p71
aVThese are the anthers of a lily,
p72
aVcleverly done
p73
aVso that when the unsuspecting insect
p74
aVlands on it,
p75
aVthe anther flips up and whops it on the back
p76
aVwith a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
p77
aVAnd there's an orchid
p78
aVthat might look to you as if it's got jaws,
p79
aVand in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out,
p80
aVgetting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
p81
aa(lp82
VOrchids: there are 20,000, at least,
p83
aVspecies of orchids \u2014
p84
aVamazingly, amazingly diverse.
p85
aVAnd they get up to all sorts of tricks.
p86
aVThey have to try and attract pollinators
p87
aVto do their bidding.
p88
aVThis orchid, known as Darwin's orchid,
p89
aVbecause it's one that he studied
p90
aVand made a wonderful prediction when he saw it \u2014
p91
aVyou can see that there's a very long nectar tube
p92
aVthat descends down
p93
aVfrom the orchid.
p94
aVAnd basically what the insect has to do \u2014
p95
aVwe're in the middle of the flower \u2014
p96
aVit has to stick its little proboscis
p97
aVright into the middle of that
p98
aVand all the way down that nectar tube
p99
aVto get to the nectar.
p100
aVAnd Darwin said, looking at this flower,
p101
aV"I guess something has coevolved with this."
p102
aVAnd sure enough,
p103
aVthere's the insect.
p104
aVAnd I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away,
p105
aVbut in its erect form,
p106
aVthat's what it looks like.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow you can imagine
p109
aVthat if nectar
p110
aVis such a valuable thing
p111
aVand expensive for the plant to produce
p112
aVand it attracts lots of pollinators,
p113
aVthen, just as in human sex,
p114
aVpeople might start to deceive.
p115
aVThey might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"
p116
aVNow this is a plant.
p117
aVThis is a plant here
p118
aVthat insects in South Africa just love,
p119
aVand they've evolved with a long proboscis
p120
aVto get the nectar at the bottom.
p121
aVAnd this is the mimic.
p122
aVSo this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.
p123
aVAnd here is the long-probosced fly
p124
aVthat has not gotten any nectar from the mimic,
p125
aVbecause the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
p126
aVSo not only has the fly
p127
aVnot got the nectar from the mimic plant,
p128
aVit's also \u2014 if you look very closely
p129
aVjust at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen
p130
aVthat it would be transmitting to another plant,
p131
aVif only some botanist hadn't come along
p132
aVand stuck it to a blue piece of card.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VNow deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.
p137
aVThis flower with its black dots:
p138
aVthey might look like black dots to us,
p139
aVbut if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species,
p140
aVthat looks like two females
p141
aVwho are really, really hot to trot.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aVAnd when the insect gets there and lands on it,
p144
aVdousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant,
p145
aVif you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture,
p146
aVyou can see that there are actually some patterning there,
p147
aVwhich is three-dimensional.
p148
aVSo it probably even feels good for the insect,
p149
aVas well as looking good.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd these electron microscope pictures \u2014
p152
aVhere's one of an orchid mimicking an insect \u2014
p153
aVyou can see that different parts of the structure
p154
aVhave different colors and different textures to our eye,
p155
aVhave very, very different textures
p156
aVto what an insect might perceive.
p157
aVAnd this one is evolved to mimic
p158
aVa glossy metallic surface
p159
aVyou see on some beetles.
p160
aVAnd under the scanning electron microscope,
p161
aVyou can see the surface there \u2014
p162
aVreally quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.
p163
aVSometimes the whole plant
p164
aVmimics an insect, even to us.
p165
aVI mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
p166
aVIt's a wonderful, amazing thing.
p167
aa(lp168
VThis one's clever. It's called obsidian.
p169
aVI think of it as insidium sometimes.
p170
aVTo the right species of bee,
p171
aVthis looks like another very aggressive bee,
p172
aVand it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away,
p173
aVand, of course, covers itself with pollen.
p174
aVThe other thing it does
p175
aVis that this plant mimics another orchid
p176
aVthat has a wonderful store
p177
aVof food for insects.
p178
aVAnd this one doesn't have anything for them.
p179
aVSo it's deceiving on two levels \u2014
p180
aVfabulous.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VHere we see ylang ylang,
p185
aVthe component of many perfumes.
p186
aVI actually smelt someone with some on earlier.
p187
aVAnd the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.
p188
aVThey're sending out a fantastic array of scent
p189
aVto any insect that'll have it.
p190
aVThis one doesn't smell so good.
p191
aVThis is a flower
p192
aVthat really, really smells pretty nasty
p193
aVand is designed, again, evolved,
p194
aVto look like carrion.
p195
aVSo flies love this.
p196
aVThey fly in and they pollinate.
p197
aVThis, which is helicodiceros,
p198
aVis also known as dead horse arum.
p199
aVI don't know what a dead horse actually smells like,
p200
aVbut this one probably smells pretty much like it.
p201
aVIt's really horrible.
p202
aVAnd blowflies just can't help themselves.
p203
aVThey fly into this thing,
p204
aVand they fly all the way down it.
p205
aVThey lay their eggs in it,
p206
aVthinking it's a nice bit of carrion,
p207
aVand not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die,
p208
aVbut the plant, meanwhile, has benefited,
p209
aVbecause the bristles release
p210
aVand the flies disappear
p211
aVto pollinate the next flower \u2014 fantastic.
p212
aa(lp213
VHere's arum, arum maculatum,
p214
aV"lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.
p215
aVI photographed this thing last week in Dorset.
p216
aVThis thing heats up
p217
aVby about 15 degrees above ambient temperature \u2014
p218
aVamazing.
p219
aVAnd if you look down into it,
p220
aVthere's this sort of dam past the spadix,
p221
aVflies get attracted by the heat \u2014
p222
aVwhich is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges \u2014
p223
aVand they get trapped underneath in this container.
p224
aVThey drink this fabulous nectar
p225
aVand then they're all a bit sticky.
p226
aVAt night they get covered in pollen,
p227
aVwhich showers down over them,
p228
aVand then the bristles that we saw above,
p229
aVthey sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen \u2014
p230
aVfabulous thing.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.
p233
aVThis is the philodendron selloum.
p234
aVFor anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.
p235
aVThis is the most amazing thing.
p236
aVThat sort of phallic bit there
p237
aVis about a foot long.
p238
aVAnd it does something
p239
aVthat no other plant that I know of does,
p240
aVand that is that when it flowers \u2014
p241
aVthat's the spadix in the middle there \u2014
p242
aVfor a period of about two days,
p243
aVit metabolizes in a way
p244
aVwhich is rather similar to mammals.
p245
aVSo instead of having starch,
p246
aVwhich is the food of plants,
p247
aVit takes something rather similar to brown fat
p248
aVand burns it at such a rate
p249
aVthat it's burning fat, metabolizing,
p250
aVabout the rate of a small cat.
p251
aVAnd that's twice the energy output, weight for weight,
p252
aVthan a hummingbird \u2014
p253
aVabsolutely astonishing.
p254
aVThis thing does something else which is unusual.
p255
aVNot only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit,
p256
aV43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days,
p257
aVbut it keeps constant temperature.
p258
aVThere's a thermoregulation mechanism in there
p259
aVthat keeps constant temperature.
p260
aV"Now why does it do this," I hear you ask.
p261
aVNow wouldn't you know it,
p262
aVthere's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.
p263
aVAnd they get inside, and they get it all on.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aVAnd the plant showers them with pollen,
p266
aVand off they go and pollinate.
p267
aVAnd what a wonderful thing it is.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow most pollinators
p270
aVthat we think about are insects,
p271
aVbut actually in the tropics,
p272
aVmany birds and butterflies pollinate.
p273
aVAnd many of the tropical flowers are red,
p274
aVand that's because butterflies and birds
p275
aVsee similarly to us, we think,
p276
aVand can see the color red very well.
p277
aVBut if you look at the spectrum,
p278
aVbirds and us, we see red, green and blue
p279
aVand see that spectrum.
p280
aVInsects see green, blue and ultraviolet,
p281
aVand they see various shades of ultraviolet.
p282
aVSo there's something that goes on off the end there.
p283
aV"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask.
p284
aVWell yes we can.
p285
aVSo what is an insect seeing?
p286
aVLast week I took these pictures of rock rose,
p287
aVhelianthemum, in Dorset.
p288
aVThese are little yellow flowers like we all see,
p289
aVlittle yellow flowers all over the place.
p290
aVAnd this is what it looks like with visible light.
p291
aVThis is what it looks like if you take out the red.
p292
aVMost bees don't perceive red.
p293
aVAnd then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera
p294
aVand took a very, very long exposure
p295
aVwith the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light
p296
aVand this is what I got.
p297
aVAnd that's a real fantastic bull's eye.
p298
aa(lp299
VNow we don't know
p300
aVexactly what a bee sees,
p301
aVany more than you know what I'm seeing
p302
aVwhen I call this red.
p303
aVWe can't know what's going on in \u2014 let alone an insect's \u2014
p304
aVanother human being's mind.
p305
aVBut the contrast will look something like that,
p306
aVso standing out a lot from the background.
p307
aVHere's another little flower \u2014
p308
aVdifferent range of ultraviolet frequencies,
p309
aVdifferent filters
p310
aVto match the pollinators.
p311
aVAnd that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
p312
aVJust in case you think
p313
aVthat all yellow flowers have this property \u2014
p314
aVno flower was damaged in the process of this shot;
p315
aVit was just attached to the tripod,
p316
aVnot killed \u2014
p317
aVthen under ultraviolet light,
p318
aVlook at that.
p319
aVAnd that could be the basis of a sunscreen
p320
aVbecause sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
p321
aVSo maybe the chemical in that would be useful.
p322
aa(lp323
VFinally, there's one of evening primrose
p324
aVthat Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me \u2014
p325
aVfantastic hidden pattern.
p326
aVAnd I love the idea of something hidden.
p327
aVI think there's something poetic here,
p328
aVthat these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter,
p329
aVthe main use of that filter
p330
aVis for astronomers to take pictures of Venus \u2014
p331
aVactually the clouds of Venus.
p332
aVThat's the main use of that filter.
p333
aVVenus, of course, is the god of love and fertility,
p334
aVwhich is the flower story.
p335
aVAnd just as flowers spend a lot of effort
p336
aVtrying to get pollinators to do their bidding,
p337
aVthey've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them
p338
aVand give them to each other
p339
aVat times of birth and death,
p340
aVand particularly at marriage,
p341
aVwhich, when you think of it,
p342
aVis the moment that encapsulates
p343
aVthe transfer of genetic material
p344
aVfrom one organism to another.
p345
aa(lp346
VThank you very much.

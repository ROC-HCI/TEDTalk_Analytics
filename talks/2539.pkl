VI used to have this recurring dream
p5
aVwhere I'd walk into a roomful of people,
p6
aVand I'd try not to make eye contact with anyone.
p7
aVUntil someone notices me,
p8
aVand I just panic.
p9
aVAnd the person walks up to me,
p10
aVand says, "Hi, my name is So-and-so.
p11
aVAnd what is your name?"
p12
aVAnd I'm just quiet, unable to respond.
p13
aVAfter some awkward silence, he goes,
p14
aV"Have you forgotten your name?"
p15
aVAnd I'm still quiet.
p16
aVAnd then, slowly, all the other people in the room begin to turn toward me
p17
aVand ask, almost in unison,
p18
aa(lp19
V(Voice-over, several voices) "Have you forgotten your name?"
p20
aVAs the chant gets louder, I want to respond, but I don't.
p21
aa(lp22
VI'm a visual artist.
p23
aVSome of my work is humorous,
p24
aVand some is a bit funny but in a sad way.
p25
aVAnd one thing that I really enjoy doing
p26
aVis making these little animations
p27
aVwhere I get to do the voice-over for all kinds of characters.
p28
aVI've been a bear.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Video) Bear (Safwat Saleem's voice): Hi.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VSafwat Saleem: I've been a whale.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Video) Whale (SS's voice): Hi.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VSS: I've been a greeting card.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Video) Greeting card (SS's voice): Hi.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VSS: And my personal favorite is Frankenstein's monster.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Video) Frankenstein's monster (SS's voice): (Grunts)
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VSS: I just had to grunt a lot for that one.
p53
aa(lp54
VA few years ago, I made this educational video
p55
aVabout the history of video games.
p56
aVAnd for that one, I got to do the voice of Space Invader.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi.
p59
aa(lp60
VSS: A dream come true, really,
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aVAnd when that video was posted online,
p64
aVI just sat there on the computer, hitting "refresh,"
p65
aVexcited to see the response.
p66
aVThe first comment comes in.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Video) Comment: Great job.
p69
aVSS: Yes!
p70
aVI hit "refresh."
p71
aa(lp72
V(Video) Comment: Excellent video. I look forward to the next one.
p73
aa(lp74
VSS: This was just the first of a two-part video.
p75
aVI was going to work on the second one next.
p76
aVI hit "refresh."
p77
aa(lp78
V(Video) Comment: Where is part TWO? WHEREEEEE? I need it NOWWWWW!: P
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VSS: People other than my mom were saying nice things about me,
p83
aVon the Internet!
p84
aVIt felt like I had finally arrived.
p85
aVI hit "refresh."
p86
aa(lp87
V(Video) Comment: His voice is annoying. No offense.
p88
aa(lp89
VSS: OK, no offense taken. Refresh.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Video) Comment: Could you remake this without peanut butter in your mouth?
p92
aa(lp93
VSS: OK, at least the feedback is somewhat constructive. Hit "refresh."
p94
aa(lp95
V(Video) Comment: Please don't use this narrator again
p96
aVu can barely understand him.
p97
aa(lp98
VSS: Refresh.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow because of the Indian accent.
p101
aa(lp102
VSS: OK, OK, OK, two things.
p103
aVNumber one, I don't have an Indian accent,
p104
aVI have a Pakistani accent, OK?
p105
aVAnd number two, I clearly have a Pakistani accent.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VBut comments like that kept coming in,
p110
aVso I figured I should just ignore them
p111
aVand start working on the second part of the video.
p112
aVI recorded my audio,
p113
aVbut every time I sat down to edit,
p114
aVI just could not do it.
p115
aVEvery single time, it would take me back to my childhood,
p116
aVwhen I had a much harder time speaking.
p117
aa(lp118
VI've stuttered for as long as I can remember.
p119
aVI was the kid in class
p120
aVwho would never raise his hand when he had a question \u2014
p121
aVor knew the answer.
p122
aVEvery time the phone rang,
p123
aVI would run to the bathroom so I would not have to answer it.
p124
aVIf it was for me, my parents would say I'm not around.
p125
aVI spent a lot of time in the bathroom.
p126
aVAnd I hated introducing myself,
p127
aVespecially in groups.
p128
aVI'd always stutter on my name, and there was usually someone who'd go,
p129
aV"Have you forgotten your name?"
p130
aVAnd then everybody would laugh.
p131
aVThat joke never got old.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VI spent my childhood feeling that if I spoke,
p136
aVit would become obvious that there was something wrong with me,
p137
aVthat I was not normal.
p138
aVSo I mostly stayed quiet.
p139
aVAnd so you see, eventually for me to even be able to use my voice in my work
p140
aVwas a huge step for me.
p141
aVEvery time I record audio,
p142
aVI fumble my way through saying each sentence many, many times,
p143
aVand then I go back in
p144
aVand pick the ones where I think I suck the least.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing is like Photoshop for your voice.
p147
aVI can slow it down, speed it up, make it deeper, add an echo.
p148
aVAnd if I stutter along the way, and if I stutter along the way,
p149
aVI just go back in and fix it.
p150
aVIt's magic.
p151
aa(lp152
VSS: Using my highly edited voice in my work
p153
aVwas a way for me to finally sound normal to myself.
p154
aVBut after the comments on the video,
p155
aVit no longer made me feel normal.
p156
aVAnd so I stopped using my voice in my work.
p157
aVSince then, I've thought a lot about what it means to be normal.
p158
aVAnd I've come to understand
p159
aVthat "normal" has a lot to do with expectations.
p160
aa(lp161
VLet me give you an example.
p162
aVI came across this story
p163
aVabout the Ancient Greek writer, Homer.
p164
aVNow, Homer mentions very few colors in his writing.
p165
aVAnd even when he does,
p166
aVhe seems to get them quite a bit wrong.
p167
aVFor example, the sea is described as wine red,
p168
aVpeople's faces are sometimes green and sheep are purple.
p169
aVBut it's not just Homer.
p170
aVIf you look at all of the ancient literature \u2014
p171
aVAncient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian
p172
aVand even the original Hebrew Bible \u2014
p173
aVthey all mention very few colors.
p174
aVAnd the most popular theory for why that might be the case
p175
aVis that cultures begin to recognize a color
p176
aVonly once they have the ability to make that color.
p177
aVSo basically, if you can make a color,
p178
aVonly then can you see it.
p179
aVA color like red, which was fairly easy for many cultures to make \u2014
p180
aVthey began to see that color fairly early on.
p181
aVBut a color like blue, which was much harder to make \u2014
p182
aVmany cultures didn't begin to learn how to make that color
p183
aVuntil much later.
p184
aVThey didn't begin to see it until much later as well.
p185
aVSo until then, even though a color might be all around them,
p186
aVthey simply did not have the ability to see it.
p187
aVIt was invisIble.
p188
aVIt was not a part of their normal.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd that story has helped put my own experience into context.
p191
aVSo when I first read the comments on the video,
p192
aVmy initial reaction was to take it all very personally.
p193
aVBut the people commenting did not know
p194
aVhow self-conscious I am about my voice.
p195
aVThey were mostly reacting to my accent,
p196
aVthat it is not normal for a narrator to have an accent.
p197
aa(lp198
VBut what is normal, anyway?
p199
aVWe know that reviewers will find more spelling errors in your writing
p200
aVif they think you're black.
p201
aVWe know that professors are less likely to help female or minority students.
p202
aVAnd we know that resumes with white-sounding names
p203
aVget more callbacks than resumes with black-sounding names.
p204
aVWhy is that?
p205
aVBecause of our expectations of what is normal.
p206
aVWe think it is normal
p207
aVwhen a black student has spelling errors.
p208
aVWe think it is normal
p209
aVwhen a female or minority student does not succeed.
p210
aVAnd we think it is normal
p211
aVthat a white employee is a better hire than a black employee.
p212
aVBut studies also show that discrimination of this kind,
p213
aVin most cases, is simply favoritism,
p214
aVand it results more from wanting to help people that you can relate to
p215
aVthan the desire to harm people that you can't relate to.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd not relating to people starts at a very early age.
p218
aVLet me give you an example.
p219
aVOne library that keeps track of characters
p220
aVin the children's book collection every year,
p221
aVfound that in 2014, only about 11 percent of the books
p222
aVhad a character of color.
p223
aVAnd just the year before, that number was about eight percent,
p224
aVeven though half of American children today come from a minority background.
p225
aVHalf.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo there are two big issues here.
p228
aVNumber one, children are told that they can be anything,
p229
aVthey can do anything,
p230
aVand yet, most stories that children of color consume
p231
aVare about people who are not like them.
p232
aVNumber two is that majority groups don't get to realize
p233
aVthe great extent to which they are similar to minorities \u2014
p234
aVour everyday experiences, our hopes,
p235
aVour dreams, our fears
p236
aVand our mutual love for hummus.
p237
aVIt's delicious!
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VJust like the color blue for Ancient Greeks,
p242
aVminorities are not a part of what we consider normal,
p243
aVbecause normal is simply a construction of what we've been exposed to,
p244
aVand how visible it is around us.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd this is where things get a bit difficult.
p247
aVI can accept the preexisting notion of normal \u2014 that normal is good,
p248
aVand anything outside of that very narrow definition of normal is bad.
p249
aVOr I can challenge that preexisting notion of normal
p250
aVwith my work
p251
aVand with my voice
p252
aVand with my accent
p253
aVand by standing here onstage,
p254
aVeven though I'm scared shitless and would rather be in the bathroom.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
V(Applause)
p259
aa(lp260
V(Video) Sheep (SS's voice): I'm now slowly starting to use my voice
p261
aVin my work again.
p262
aVAnd it feels good.
p263
aVIt does not mean I won't have a breakdown
p264
aVthe next time a couple dozen people say that I talk
p265
aV(Mumbling) like I have peanut butter in my mouth.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VSS: It just means I now have a much better understanding
p270
aVof what's at stake,
p271
aVand how giving up is not an option.
p272
aa(lp273
VThe Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up one day and realize
p274
aVthat the sky was blue.
p275
aVIt took centuries, even, for humans to realize what we had been ignoring
p276
aVfor so long.
p277
aVAnd so we must continuously challenge our notion of normal,
p278
aVbecause doing so is going to allow us as a society
p279
aVto finally see the sky for what it is.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Video) Characters: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
p282
aVFrankenstein's monster: (Grunts)
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VSS: Thank you.

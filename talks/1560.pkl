VThe murder happened a little over 21 years ago,
p5
aVJanuary the 18th, 1991,
p6
aVin a small
p7
aVbedroom community
p8
aVof Lynwood, California, just a few miles
p9
aVsoutheast of Los Angeles.
p10
aVA father came out of his house
p11
aVto tell his teenage son and his five friends
p12
aVthat it was time for them to stop horsing around
p13
aVon the front lawn and on the sidewalk,
p14
aVto get home, finish their schoolwork,
p15
aVand prepare themselves for bed.
p16
aVAnd as the father was administering these instructions,
p17
aVa car drove by, slowly,
p18
aVand just after it passed the father and the teenagers,
p19
aVa hand went out from the front passenger window,
p20
aVand \u2014 "Bam, Bam!" \u2014 killing the father.
p21
aVAnd the car sped off.
p22
aa(lp23
VThe police,
p24
aVinvestigating officers, were amazingly efficient.
p25
aVThey considered all the usual culprits,
p26
aVand in less than 24 hours, they had selected their suspect:
p27
aVFrancisco Carrillo, a 17-year-old kid
p28
aVwho lived about two or three blocks away
p29
aVfrom where the shooting occurred.
p30
aVThey found photos of him. They prepared a photo array,
p31
aVand the day after the shooting,
p32
aVthey showed it to one of the teenagers, and he said,
p33
aV"That's the picture.
p34
aVThat's the shooter I saw that killed the father."
p35
aa(lp36
VThat was all a preliminary hearing judge had
p37
aVto listen to, to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial
p38
aVfor a first-degree murder.
p39
aVIn the investigation that followed before the actual trial,
p40
aVeach of the other five teenagers was shown
p41
aVphotographs, the same photo array.
p42
aVThe picture that we best can determine was probably
p43
aVthe one that they were shown in the photo array
p44
aVis in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots.
p45
aVThe reason we're not sure absolutely is because
p46
aVof the nature of evidence preservation
p47
aVin our judicial system,
p48
aVbut that's another whole TEDx talk for later. (Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VSo at the actual trial,
p51
aVall six of the teenagers testified,
p52
aVand indicated the identifications they had made
p53
aVin the photo array.
p54
aVHe was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment,
p55
aVand transported to Folsom Prison.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo what's wrong?
p58
aVStraightforward, fair trial, full investigation.
p59
aVOh yes, no gun was ever found.
p60
aVNo vehicle was ever identified as being the one
p61
aVin which the shooter had extended his arm,
p62
aVand no person was ever charged with being the driver
p63
aVof the shooter's vehicle.
p64
aVAnd Mr. Carrillo's alibi?
p65
aVWhich of those parents here in the room might not lie
p66
aVconcerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter
p67
aVin an investigation of a killing?
p68
aa(lp69
VSent to prison,
p70
aVadamantly insisting on his innocence,
p71
aVwhich he has consistently for 21 years.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo what's the problem?
p74
aVThe problems, actually, for this kind of case
p75
aVcome manyfold from decades of scientific research
p76
aVinvolving human memory.
p77
aVFirst of all, we have all the statistical analyses
p78
aVfrom the Innocence Project work,
p79
aVwhere we know that we have, what,
p80
aV250, 280 documented cases now where people have
p81
aVbeen wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated,
p82
aVsome from death row, on the basis of later DNA analysis,
p83
aVand you know that over three quarters of all of those cases
p84
aVof exoneration involved only eyewitness identification
p85
aVtestimony during the trial that convicted them.
p86
aVWe know that eyewitness identifications are fallible.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe other comes from an interesting aspect
p89
aVof human memory that's related to various brain functions
p90
aVbut I can sum up for the sake of brevity here
p91
aVin a simple line:
p92
aVThe brain abhors a vacuum.
p93
aVUnder the best of observation conditions,
p94
aVthe absolute best,
p95
aVwe only detect, encode and store in our brains
p96
aVbits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us,
p97
aVand they're stored in different parts of the brain.
p98
aVSo now, when it's important for us to be able to recall
p99
aVwhat it was that we experienced,
p100
aVwe have an incomplete, we have a partial store,
p101
aVand what happens?
p102
aVBelow awareness, with no requirement for any kind of
p103
aVmotivated processing, the brain fills in information
p104
aVthat was not there,
p105
aVnot originally stored,
p106
aVfrom inference, from speculation,
p107
aVfrom sources of information that came to you,
p108
aVas the observer, after the observation.
p109
aVBut it happens without awareness such that
p110
aVyou don't, aren't even cognizant of it occurring.
p111
aVIt's called reconstructed memories.
p112
aVIt happens to us in all the aspects of our life, all the time.
p113
aVIt was those two considerations, among others \u2014
p114
aVreconstructed memory, the fact about the eyewitness fallibility \u2014
p115
aVthat was part of the instigation
p116
aVfor a group of appeal attorneys
p117
aVled by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers
p118
aVto pool their experience and their talents together
p119
aVand petition a superior court
p120
aVfor a retrial for Francisco Carrillo.
p121
aVThey retained me, as a forensic neurophysiologist,
p122
aVbecause I had expertise
p123
aVin eyewitness memory identification,
p124
aVwhich obviously makes sense for this case, right?
p125
aVBut also because I have expertise and testify about
p126
aVthe nature of human night vision.
p127
aa(lp128
VWell, what's that got to do with this?
p129
aVWell, when you read through the case materials
p130
aVin this Carrillo case,
p131
aVone of the things that suddenly strikes you is that
p132
aVthe investigating officers said the lighting was good
p133
aVat the crime scene, at the shooting.
p134
aVAll the teenagers testified during the trial
p135
aVthat they could see very well.
p136
aVBut this occurred in mid-January,
p137
aVin the Northern Hemisphere, at 7 p.m. at night.
p138
aVSo when I did the calculations
p139
aVfor the lunar data and the solar data
p140
aVat that location on Earth at the time of the incident
p141
aVof the shooting, all right,
p142
aVit was well past the end of civil twilight
p143
aVand there was no moon up that night.
p144
aVSo all the light in this area from the sun and the moon
p145
aVis what you see on the screen right here.
p146
aVThe only lighting in that area had to come
p147
aVfrom artificial sources,
p148
aVand that's where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction
p149
aVof the scene with photometers, with various measures
p150
aVof illumination and various other measures of
p151
aVcolor perception, along with special cameras
p152
aVand high-speed film, right?
p153
aVTake all the measurements and record them, right?
p154
aVAnd then take photographs, and this is what the scene
p155
aVlooked like at the time of the shooting
p156
aVfrom the position of the teenagers
p157
aVlooking at the car going by and shooting.
p158
aVThis is looking directly across the street
p159
aVfrom where they were standing.
p160
aVRemember, the investigating officers' report said
p161
aVthe lighting was good.
p162
aVThe teenagers said they could see very well.
p163
aVThis is looking down to the east,
p164
aVwhere the shooting vehicle sped off,
p165
aVand this is the lighting directly behind the father
p166
aVand the teenagers.
p167
aVAs you can see, it is at best poor.
p168
aVNo one's going to call this well-lit, good lighting,
p169
aVand in fact, as nice as these pictures are,
p170
aVand the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court,
p171
aVand a picture is worth more than a thousand words
p172
aVwhen you're trying to communicate numbers,
p173
aVabstract concepts like lux, the international measurement
p174
aVof illumination, the Ishihara color perception test values.
p175
aVWhen you present those to people who are not well-versed
p176
aVin those aspects of science and that, they become
p177
aVsalamanders in the noonday sun. It's like
p178
aVtalking about the tangent of the visual angle, all right?
p179
aVTheir eyes just glaze over, all right?
p180
aVA good forensic expert also has to be a good educator,
p181
aVa good communicator, and that's part of the reason
p182
aVwhy we take the pictures, to show not only
p183
aVwhere the light sources are, and what we call the spill,
p184
aVthe distribution, but also so that it's easier
p185
aVfor the trier of fact to understand the circumstances.
p186
aVSo these are some of the pictures that, in fact,
p187
aVI used when I testified,
p188
aVbut more importantly were, to me as a scientist,
p189
aVare those readings, the photometer readings,
p190
aVwhich I can then convert into actual predictions
p191
aVof the visual capability of the human eye
p192
aVunder those circumstances,
p193
aVand from my readings that I recorded at the scene
p194
aVunder the same solar and lunar conditions
p195
aVat the same time, so on and so forth, right,
p196
aVI could predict
p197
aVthat there would be no reliable color perception,
p198
aVwhich is crucial for face recognition,
p199
aVand that there would be only scotopic vision,
p200
aVwhich means there would be very little resolution,
p201
aVwhat we call boundary or edge detection,
p202
aVand that furthermore, because the eyes would have been
p203
aVtotally dilated under this light, the depth of field,
p204
aVthe distance at which you can focus and see details,
p205
aVwould have been less than 18 inches away.
p206
aa(lp207
VI testified to that to the court,
p208
aVand while the judge was very attentive,
p209
aVit had been a very, very long hearing
p210
aVfor this petition for a retrial, and as a result,
p211
aVI noticed out of the corner of my eye
p212
aVthat I thought that maybe the judge was going to need
p213
aVa little more of a nudge
p214
aVthan just more numbers.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd here I became a bit audacious,
p217
aVand I turned
p218
aVand I asked the judge,
p219
aVI said, "Your Honor, I think you should go out
p220
aVand look at the scene yourself."
p221
aa(lp222
VNow I may have used a tone which was more like a dare
p223
aVthan a request \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p224
aVbut nonetheless, it's to this man's credit and his courage
p225
aVthat he said, "Yes, I will."
p226
aVA shocker in American jurisprudence.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo in fact, we found the same identical conditions,
p229
aVwe reconstructed the entire thing again,
p230
aVhe came out with an entire brigade of sheriff's officers
p231
aVto protect him in this community, all right? (Laughter)
p232
aVWe had him stand actually slightly in the street,
p233
aVso closer to the suspect vehicle, the shooter vehicle,
p234
aVthan the actual teenagers were,
p235
aVso he stood a few feet from the curb
p236
aVtoward the middle of the street.
p237
aVWe had a car that came by,
p238
aVsame identical car as described by the teenagers, right?
p239
aVIt had a driver and a passenger,
p240
aVand after the car had passed the judge by,
p241
aVthe passenger extended his hand,
p242
aVpointed it back to the judge as the car continued on,
p243
aVjust as the teenagers had described it, right?
p244
aVNow, he didn't use a real gun in his hand,
p245
aVso he had a black object in his hand that was similar
p246
aVto the gun that was described.
p247
aVHe pointed by, and this is what the judge saw.
p248
aa(lp249
VThis is the car 30 feet away from the judge.
p250
aVThere's an arm sticking out of the passenger side
p251
aVand pointed back at you.
p252
aVThat's 30 feet away.
p253
aVSome of the teenagers said that in fact the car
p254
aVwas 15 feet away when it shot.
p255
aVOkay. There's 15 feet.
p256
aa(lp257
VAt this point, I became a little concerned.
p258
aVThis judge is someone you'd never want to play poker with.
p259
aVHe was totally stoic. I couldn't see a twitch of his eyebrow.
p260
aVI couldn't see the slightest bend of his head.
p261
aVI had no sense of how he was reacting to this,
p262
aVand after he looked at this reenactment,
p263
aVhe turned to me and he says,
p264
aV"Is there anything else you want me to look at?"
p265
aa(lp266
VI said, "Your honor," and I don't know whether I was
p267
aVemboldened by the scientific measurements that I had
p268
aVin my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate,
p269
aVor whether it was just sheer stupidity,
p270
aVwhich is what the defense lawyers thought \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p271
aVwhen they heard me say,
p272
aV"Yes, Your Honor, I want you stand right there
p273
aVand I want the car to go around the block again
p274
aVand I want it to come and I want it to stop
p275
aVright in front of you, three to four feet away,
p276
aVand I want the passenger to extend his hand
p277
aVwith a black object and point it right at you,
p278
aVand you can look at it as long as you want."
p279
aVAnd that's what he saw. (Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VYou'll notice, which was also in my test report,
p282
aVall the dominant lighting is coming from the north side,
p283
aVwhich means that the shooter's face would
p284
aVhave been photo-occluded. It would have been backlit.
p285
aVFurthermore, the roof of the car
p286
aVis causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car
p287
aVwhich is making it darker.
p288
aVAnd this is three to four feet away.
p289
aa(lp290
VWhy did I take the risk?
p291
aVI knew that the depth of field was 18 inches or less.
p292
aVThree to four feet, it might as well have been
p293
aVa football field away.
p294
aVThis is what he saw.
p295
aVHe went back, there was a few more days of evidence
p296
aVthat was heard. At the end of it,
p297
aVhe made the judgment that he was going to grant
p298
aVthe petition for a retrial.
p299
aVAnd furthermore, he released Mr. Carrillo
p300
aVso that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense
p301
aVif the prosecution decided to retry him.
p302
aa(lp303
VWhich they decided not to.
p304
aVHe is now a freed man. (Applause)
p305
aa(lp306
V(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VThis is him embracing his grandmother-in-law.
p309
aVHe \u2014 His girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial,
p310
aVright? And she had a little baby boy.
p311
aVHe and his son are both attending Cal State, Long Beach
p312
aVright now taking classes. (Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd what does this example \u2014
p315
aVwhat's important to keep in mind for ourselves?
p316
aa(lp317
VFirst of all, there's a long history of antipathy
p318
aVbetween science and the law
p319
aVin American jurisprudence.
p320
aVI could regale you with horror stories of ignorance
p321
aVover decades of experience as a forensic expert
p322
aVof just trying to get science into the courtroom.
p323
aVThe opposing council always fight it and oppose it.
p324
aa(lp325
VOne suggestion is that all of us become much more
p326
aVattuned to the necessity, through policy,
p327
aVthrough procedures,
p328
aVto get more science in the courtroom,
p329
aVand I think one large step toward that
p330
aVis more requirements,
p331
aVwith all due respect to the law schools,
p332
aVof science, technology, engineering, mathematics
p333
aVfor anyone going into the law,
p334
aVbecause they become the judges.
p335
aVThink about how we select our judges in this country.
p336
aVIt's very different than most other cultures. All right?
p337
aa(lp338
VThe other one that I want to suggest,
p339
aVthe caution that all of us have to have,
p340
aVI constantly have to remind myself,
p341
aVabout just how accurate are the memories
p342
aVthat we know are true, that we believe in?
p343
aVThere is decades of research,
p344
aVexamples and examples of cases like this,
p345
aVwhere individuals
p346
aVreally, really believe. None of those teenagers
p347
aVwho identified him
p348
aVthought that they were picking the wrong person.
p349
aVNone of them thought they couldn't see the person's face.
p350
aVWe all have to be very careful.
p351
aVAll our memories are reconstructed memories.
p352
aVThey are the product of what we originally experienced
p353
aVand everything that's happened afterwards.
p354
aVThey're dynamic.
p355
aVThey're malleable. They're volatile,
p356
aVand as a result, we all need to remember to be cautious,
p357
aVthat the accuracy of our memories
p358
aVis not measured in how vivid they are
p359
aVnor how certain you are that they're correct.
p360
aa(lp361
VThank you. (Applause)

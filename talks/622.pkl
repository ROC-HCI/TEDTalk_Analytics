VI've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now,
p5
aVever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article
p6
aVby a guy named Jack Harlan.
p7
aVAnd he described the diversity within crops \u2014
p8
aVall the different kinds of wheat and rice and such \u2014
p9
aVas a genetic resource.
p10
aVAnd he said, "This genetic resource," \u2014
p11
aVand I'll never forget the words \u2014
p12
aV"stands between us and catastrophic starvation
p13
aVon a scale we cannot imagine."
p14
aa(lp15
VI figured he was either really on to something,
p16
aVor he was one of these academic nutcases.
p17
aVSo, I looked a little further,
p18
aVand what I figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase.
p19
aVHe was the most respected scientist in the field.
p20
aVWhat he understood was that biological diversity \u2014 crop diversity \u2014
p21
aVis the biological foundation of agriculture.
p22
aVIt's the raw material, the stuff, of evolution in our agricultural crops.
p23
aVNot a trivial matter.
p24
aVAnd he also understood that that foundation was crumbling,
p25
aVliterally crumbling.
p26
aVThat indeed, a mass extinction was underway
p27
aVin our fields, in our agricultural system.
p28
aVAnd that this mass extinction was taking place
p29
aVwith very few people noticing
p30
aVand even fewer caring.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, I know that many of you don't stop
p33
aVto think about diversity in agricultural systems
p34
aVand, let's face it, that's logical.
p35
aVYou don't see it in the newspaper every day.
p36
aVAnd when you go into the supermarket, you certainly don't see a lot of choices there.
p37
aVYou see apples that are red, yellow, and green and that's about it.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo, let me show you a picture of one form of diversity.
p40
aVHere's some beans,
p41
aVand there are about 35 or 40 different
p42
aVvarieties of beans on this picture.
p43
aVNow, imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another
p44
aVabout the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane.
p45
aVIf I wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world,
p46
aVand I put 30 or 40 of them on a slide, it would take about 10 slides
p47
aVbecause there about 400 breeds of dogs in the world.
p48
aVBut there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans.
p49
aVSo if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world,
p50
aVand I had a slide like this, and I switched it every second,
p51
aVit would take up my entire TED talk,
p52
aVand I wouldn't have to say anything.
p53
aa(lp54
VBut the interesting thing is that this diversity \u2014 and the tragic thing is \u2014
p55
aVthat this diversity is being lost.
p56
aVWe have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat,
p57
aVand we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice,
p58
aVbut it's being lost.
p59
aVAnd I want to give you an example of that.
p60
aVIt's a bit of a personal example, in fact.
p61
aVIn the United States, in the 1800s \u2014 that's where we have the best data \u2014
p62
aVfarmers and gardeners were growing 7,100
p63
aVnamed varieties of apples.
p64
aVImagine that. 7,100 apples with names.
p65
aVToday, 6,800 of those are extinct,
p66
aVno longer to be seen again.
p67
aa(lp68
VI used to have a list of these extinct apples,
p69
aVand when I would go out and give a presentation,
p70
aVI would pass the list out in the audience.
p71
aVI wouldn't tell them what it was, but it was in alphabetical order,
p72
aVand I would tell them to look for their names, their family names,
p73
aVtheir mother's maiden name.
p74
aVAnd at the end of the speech, I would ask, "How many people have found a name?"
p75
aVAnd I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand.
p76
aVAnd I said, "You know what? These apples come from your ancestors,
p77
aVand your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them.
p78
aVThey gave them their name.
p79
aVThe bad news is they're extinct.
p80
aVThe good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there.
p81
aVFind it. Make sure it doesn't join the list."
p82
aa(lp83
VSo, I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is
p84
aVthat the Fowler apple is still out there.
p85
aVAnd there's an old book back here,
p86
aVand I want to read a piece from it.
p87
aVThis book was published in 1904.
p88
aVIt's called "The Apples of New York" and this is the second volume.
p89
aVSee, we used to have a lot of apples.
p90
aVAnd the Fowler apple is described in here \u2014
p91
aVI hope this doesn't surprise you \u2014
p92
aVas, "a beautiful fruit."
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVI don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us, but ...
p95
aVbut, to be honest, the description goes on
p96
aVand it says that it "doesn't rank high in quality, however."
p97
aVAnd then he has to go even further.
p98
aVIt sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine.
p99
aV"As grown in New York, the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality
p100
aVand is, on the whole, unsatisfactory."
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd I guess there's a lesson to be learned here,
p105
aVand the lesson is: so why save it?
p106
aVI get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one?
p107
aVAnd there are a couple of answers to that question.
p108
aVOne thing is that there is no such thing as a best one.
p109
aVToday's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease.
p110
aVThe other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple
p111
aVor maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now
p112
aVhas disease or pest resistance
p113
aVor some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't.
p114
aVSo it's not necessary, thank God,
p115
aVthat the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world.
p116
aVIt's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait.
p117
aVAnd for that reason, we ought to be saving it.
p118
aVWhy? As a raw material, as a trait we can use in the future.
p119
aVThink of diversity as giving us options.
p120
aVAnd options, of course, are exactly what we need in an era of climate change.
p121
aa(lp122
VI want to show you two slides,
p123
aVbut first, I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust
p124
aVwith a number of scientists \u2014 particularly at Stanford and University of Washington \u2014
p125
aVto ask the question: What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change
p126
aVand what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops
p127
aVto be able to adapt to this?
p128
aVIn short, the answer is that in the future, in many countries,
p129
aVthe coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter
p130
aVthan anything those crops have seen in the past.
p131
aVThe coldest growing seasons of the future,
p132
aVhotter than the hottest of the past.
p133
aVIs agriculture adapted to that?
p134
aVI don't know. Can fish play the piano?
p135
aVIf agriculture hasn't experienced that, how could it be adapted?
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world,
p138
aVand the place where climate change, ironically, is going to be the worst
p139
aVis in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
p140
aVSo I've picked two examples here, and I want to show you.
p141
aVIn the histogram before you now,
p142
aVthe blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures,
p143
aVgoing back about far as we have temperature data.
p144
aVAnd you can see that there's some difference
p145
aVbetween one growing season and another.
p146
aVSome are colder, some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve.
p147
aVThe tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons.
p148
aVIn the future, later this century, it's going to look like the red,
p149
aVtotally out of bounds.
p150
aVThe agricultural system and, more importantly, the crops in the field in India
p151
aVhave never experienced this before.
p152
aa(lp153
VHere's South Africa. The same story.
p154
aVBut the most interesting thing about South Africa is
p155
aVwe don't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble.
p156
aVBy 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop \u2014
p157
aV50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field \u2014
p158
aVin 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize
p159
aVbecause of the climate change already in 2030.
p160
aV30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population,
p161
aVthat's a food crisis. It's global in nature.
p162
aVWe will watch children starve to death on TV.
p163
aVNow, you may say that 20 years is a long way off.
p164
aVIt's two breeding cycles for maize.
p165
aVWe have two rolls of the dice to get this right.
p166
aVWe have to get climate-ready crops in the field,
p167
aVand we have to do that rather quickly.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, the good news is that we have conserved.
p170
aVWe have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity,
p171
aVagricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed,
p172
aVand we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer.
p173
aVIf you want to conserve seed for a long term
p174
aVand you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers,
p175
aVyou dry it and then you freeze it.
p176
aVUnfortunately, these seed banks are located around the world in buildings
p177
aVand they're vulnerable.
p178
aVDisasters have happened. In recent years we lost the gene bank,
p179
aVthe seed bank in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can guess why.
p180
aVIn Rwanda, in the Solomon Islands.
p181
aVAnd then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings,
p182
aVfinancial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures,
p183
aVand all kinds of things, and every time something like this happens,
p184
aVit means extinction. We lose diversity.
p185
aVAnd I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys.
p186
aVI'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs:
p187
aVactually losing it, never to be seen again.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo, a number of us got together and decided that, you know, enough is enough
p190
aVand we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility
p191
aVthat can really offer protection for our biological diversity of \u2014
p192
aVmaybe not the most charismatic diversity.
p193
aVYou don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear,
p194
aVbut it's very important diversity.
p195
aVSo we needed a really safe place, and we went quite far north to find it.
p196
aVTo Svalbard, in fact.
p197
aVThis is above mainland Norway. You can see Greenland there.
p198
aVThat's at 78 degrees north.
p199
aVIt's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane.
p200
aVIt's a remarkably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you.
p201
aVIt's otherworldly, beautiful.
p202
aVWe worked with the Norwegian government
p203
aVand with the NorGen, the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program,
p204
aVto design this facility.
p205
aVWhat you see is an artist's conception of this facility,
p206
aVwhich is built in a mountain in Svalbard.
p207
aVThe idea of Svalbard was that it's cold,
p208
aVso we get natural freezing temperatures.
p209
aVBut it's remote. It's remote and accessible
p210
aVso it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis is more than just an artist's dream, it's now a reality.
p213
aVAnd this next picture shows it in context, in Svalbard.
p214
aVAnd here's the front door of this facility.
p215
aVWhen you open up the front door,
p216
aVthis is what you're looking at. It's pretty simple. It's a hole in the ground.
p217
aVIt's a tunnel, and you go into the tunnel,
p218
aVchiseled in solid rock, about 130 meters.
p219
aVThere are now a couple of security doors, so you won't see it quite like this.
p220
aVAgain, when you get to the back, you get into an area that's really my favorite place.
p221
aVI think of it as sort of a cathedral.
p222
aVAnd I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd, but ...
p223
aV(Laughter)
p224
aVSome of the happiest days of my life have been spent ...
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aVin this place there.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VIf you were to walk into one of these rooms, you would see this.
p231
aVIt's not very exciting, but if you know what's there, it's pretty emotional.
p232
aVWe have now about 425,000
p233
aVsamples of unique crop varieties.
p234
aVThere's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice
p235
aVin this facility right now.
p236
aVAbout a year from now, we'll have over half a million samples.
p237
aVWe're going up to over a million, and someday we'll basically have samples \u2014
p238
aVabout 500 seeds \u2014
p239
aVof every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state
p240
aVin this facility.
p241
aVThis is a backup system for world agriculture.
p242
aVIt's a backup system for all the seed banks. Storage is free.
p243
aVIt operates like a safety deposit box.
p244
aVNorway owns the mountain and the facility, but the depositors own the seed.
p245
aVAnd if anything happens, then they can come back and get it.
p246
aVThis particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States,
p247
aVof Canada, and an international institution from Syria.
p248
aa(lp249
VI think it's interesting in that this facility, I think,
p250
aVis almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries,
p251
aVliterally, every country in the world \u2014
p252
aVbecause we have seeds from every country in the world \u2014
p253
aVall the countries of the world have gotten together
p254
aVto do something that's both long term, sustainable and positive.
p255
aVI can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way.
p256
aa(lp257
VI can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution
p258
aVfor climate change, for the water crisis.
p259
aVAgriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth.
p260
aVI can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution
p261
aVfor those things, or the energy crisis, or world hunger, or peace in conflict.
p262
aVI can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that,
p263
aVbut I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems
p264
aVif we don't have crop diversity.
p265
aVBecause I challenge you to think of an effective, efficient, sustainable
p266
aVsolution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity.
p267
aVBecause, quite literally, if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change,
p268
aVneither will we.
p269
aVAnd if crops don't adapt to climate change, neither will agriculture,
p270
aVneither will we.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo, this is not something pretty and nice to do.
p273
aVThere are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist
p274
aVjust for the existence value of it.
p275
aVIt is, I agree, a nice thing to do.
p276
aVBut it's a necessary thing to do.
p277
aVSo, in a very real sense, I believe that we, as an international community,
p278
aVshould get organized to complete the task.
p279
aVThe Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a wonderful gift
p280
aVthat Norway and others have given us,
p281
aVbut it's not the complete answer.
p282
aVWe need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there.
p283
aVWe need to put it into good seed banks
p284
aVthat can offer those seeds to researchers in the future.
p285
aVWe need to catalog it. It's a library of life,
p286
aVbut right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it.
p287
aVAnd we need to support it financially.
p288
aa(lp289
VMy big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace
p290
aVto endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university,
p291
aVwe really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat.
p292
aV30 million dollars in an endowment would take care
p293
aVof preserving all the diversity in wheat forever.
p294
aVSo we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd my final thought is that we, of course, by conserving wheat,
p297
aVrice, potatoes, and the other crops,
p298
aVwe may, quite simply, end up saving ourselves.
p299
aa(lp300
VThank you.

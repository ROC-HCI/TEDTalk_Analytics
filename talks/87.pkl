VYou know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no,
p5
aVbecause I felt like I wasn't going to be able
p6
aVto make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to.
p7
aVIt's such a large conference.
p8
aVBut he explained to me that he was in a bind,
p9
aVand that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal
p10
aVand star power that the conference was known for.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo I said fine, Ted \u2014 I mean Chris.
p13
aVI'll come on two conditions.
p14
aVOne: I want to speak as early in the morning as possible.
p15
aVAnd two: I want to pick the theme for TED 2006.
p16
aVAnd luckily he agreed.
p17
aVAnd the theme, in two years, is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."

p57
aVand my best wishes to you and family.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Breathes in)
p60
aa(lp61
VI know this letter will come to you surprisingly,
p62
aVbut let it not be a surprise to you,
p63
aVfor nature has a way of arriving unannounced,
p64
aVand, as an adage says, originals are very hard to find,
p65
aVbut their echoes sound ouder.
p66
aVSo I decided to contact you myself,
p67
aVfor you to assure me of safety and honesty,
p68
aVif I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody.
p69
aVI am Mr Micheal Bangura, the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura
p70
aVwho was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone

p74

VKnowing your country to be economical conducive for investment,

V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VBefore my father death,
p82
aVhe had the sum of 23 million United States dollars,
p83
aVwhich he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VThis fund was supposed to be used
p88
aVfor the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country,
p89
aVbefore the outbreak of war.
p90
aVWhen the war broke out,
p91
aVthe rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him,
p92
aVmy father insisted it was not in his possession,
p93
aVand he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
p94
aVMeanwhile, my mother and I
p95
aVis the only person who knows about it because my father always confide in me.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Sighs)
p98
aa(lp99
VI made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker,
p100
aVwho used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown,
p101
aValthough he did not know the real contents of the box.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VThe fund was deposited as a family reasure,
p106
aVin a safe, reliable security company in Dakar, Senegal,
p107
aVwhere I was only given temporary asylum.
p108
aVI do not wish to invest the money in Senegal
p109
aVdue to unfavorable economic climate, and so close to my country.
p110
aVThe only assistance I need from you, which I know you would do for me,
p111
aVare the following: one, be a silent partner
p112
aVand receive the funds in your account in trust;
p113
aVtwo, provide a bank account under your control
p114
aVto which the funds will be remitted;
p115
aVthree, receive the funds into your account in trust;
p116
aVtake out your commission; and leave the rest of the money
p117
aVuntil I arrive, after the transfer is complete.
p118
aVSincerely, Mr Micheal Bangura."

V(Laughter)

p123
aa(lp124
VThis is really embarrassing.
p125
aVI was told backstage that I have 18 minutes.
p126
aVI only prepared 15.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VSo if it's cool, I'd like to just wait for three.
p131

VAre you a virgin? Virgin?
p152

p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VAre you? Oh, yeah?
p158
aVSo what are you, like, a thousand, two thousand, somewhere in there?

aa(lp177
V(Applause)
p178
aa(lp179
VYeah, I was hanging out with some Google guys last night.
p180
aVReally cool, we were getting wasted.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced
p185
aVthat, based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime,
p186
aVthey can actually predict what you are going to say \u2014
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
Vnext.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd I was like, "Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy."
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VBut they said, "No, but don't show anyone."
p197
aa(lp198
VBut they slipped up.
p199
aVAnd they said that I could just type in "What was I going to say next?"
p200
aVand my name, and it would tell me.
p201
aVAnd I have to tell you, this is an unadulterated piece of software,
p202
aVthis is a real Internet browser and this is the actual Google site,
p203
aVand we're going to test it out live today.
p204
aVWhat was I going to say next?
p205
aVAnd "Ze Frank" \u2014 that's me.
p206
aVAm I feeling lucky?
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210

aa(lp226
VI filmed myself dancing to Madonna's "Justify My Love."
p227
aVOn a Thursday, I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips
p228
aVto 17 of my closest friends,
p229
aVas part of an invitation to my \u2014 an invitation to my th \u2014

VWithin a week, I received a call from Earthlink that said,
p243
aVdue to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge,
p244
aVI owed them 30,000 dollars.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VNeedless to say, I was able to leave my job.
p249
aa(lp250
V[WAS LAID OFF]
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254

p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
V[UNEMPLOYED]
p259
aa(lp260
VBut some people refer to me more as, like, an Internet guru or \u2014

V[JACKASS]
p263
aa(lp264
Vswami.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VI knew I had something.
p269
aVI'd basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain
p270
aVand complex philosophy, which I won't get into here,
p271
aVbecause it's a little too deep for all of you, but \u2014
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VIt's about what makes websites popular, and, you know, it's \u2014
p276
aa(lp277
V[DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT AND DON'T SELL ANYTHING]
p278
aa(lp279
VIt's unfortunate that I don't have more time.
p280
aVMaybe I can come back next year, or something like that.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VI'm obsessed with email. I get a lot of it.
p285
aVFour years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day
p286
aVfrom people I don't know,
p287
aVand it's been an amazing opportunity
p288
aVto kind of get to know different cultures, you know?
p289
aVIt's like a microscope to the rest of the world.
p290
aVYou can kind of peer into other people's lives.
p291
aVAnd I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user.
p292
aVFor example, somebody wrote, "Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder,
p293
aVyou should rock out with us," and I said, "Why wait?"
p294
aa(lp295
V[rocking out]
p296
aa(lp297
V(Video) (Music)
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd they said, "Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out,
p300
aVbut I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked."
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd that was embarrassing.
p305
aVBut you know, it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans,
p306
aVso I said, "Sure."
p307
aa(lp308
V[rocking out naked]
p309
aa(lp310
V(Video) (Music)
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VI hear a lot of you whispering.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Laughter)
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd I know what you're saying,
p319
aV"Holy crap!
p320
aVHow is his presentation so smooth?"
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd I have to say that it's not all me this year.
p325
aVI guess Chris has to take some credit here, because in years past,
p326
aVI guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED.
p327
aVI don't know.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd so, this year, Chris sent us a TED conference simulator.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VWhich really allowed us as speakers to get there, in the trenches,
p334
aVand practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience.
p335
aVAnd I've got to say that, you know, it's really, really great to be here.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Pre-recorded applause)
p338
aa(lp339
VI'd like to tell all of you a little joke.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Pre-recorded applause and cheering)
p342
aa(lp343
VNot just the good stuff, though.
p344
aVYou can do heckler mode.
p345
aa(lp346
VVoice: Hey, moron, get off the stage!
p347
aa(lp348
VZF: You get off the stage.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VVoice: We want Malcolm Gladwell.

aa(lp356
V(Baby cooing)
p357
aa(lp358
V(Huge crowd applauding)
p359
aa(lp360
VIn case you run over time.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Heroic music)
p363
aa(lp364
VJust one last thing I'd like to say, I'd, really \u2014
p365
aa(lp366
V(Laughter)
p367
aa(lp368
VI'd like to thank all of you for being here.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Loud music)
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd frog mode.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Singing)
p377
aa(lp378
V(Sings) "Ah, the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp \u2014"
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
V[Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes]
p383
aa(lp384
V(Sighs)
p385
aa(lp386
VIt's true.
p387
aVSome people say to me,
p388
aV"Ze, you're doing all this stuff, this Internet stuff,
p389
aVand you're not making any money."
p390
aa(lp391
V(Laughter)
p392
aa(lp393
V"Why?" And I say, "Mom, Dad \u2014
p394
aa(lp395
V(Laughter)
p396
aa(lp397
VI'm trying."
p398
aVI don't know if you're all aware of this,
p399
aVbut the video game market,
p400
aVkids are playing these video games,
p401
aVbut, supposedly, there's tons of money.
p402
aVI mean, like, I think, 100,000 dollars or so a year
p403
aVis being spent on these things.
p404
aVSo I decided to try my hand.
p405
aVI came up with a few games.
p406
aa(lp407
V(Laughter)
p408
aa(lp409
VThis is called "Atheist."
p410
aVI figured it would be popular with the young kids.
p411
aVOK.
p412
aVLook, I'll move around and say some things.
p413
aa(lp414
V(Sighs)
p415
aa(lp416
V[Game over. There is no replay.]
p417
aa(lp418
V(Laughter)
p419
aa(lp420
VSo that didn't go over so well.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Laughter)
p423
aa(lp424
VI don't really understand why you're laughing.
p425
aa(lp426
V(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
VShould have done this before I tried to pitch it.
p429
aV"Buddhist," of course, looks very, very similar to "Atheist."
p430
aa(lp431
V(Laughter)
p432
aa(lp433
VBut you come back as a duck.
p434
aa(lp435
V(Laughter)
p436
aa(lp437
VAnd this is great because, you know, for a quarter,
p438
aVyou can play this for a long time.
p439
aa(lp440
V(Laughter)
p441
aa(lp442
VAnd Chris had said in an email
p443
aVthat we should really bring something new to TED,
p444
aVsomething that we haven't shown anyone.
p445
aVSo, I made this for TED. It's "Christian."
p446
aVIt's the third in the series.
p447
aVI'm hoping it's going to do well this year.
p448
aa(lp449
V(Sighs)
p450
aa(lp451
V(Laughter)
p452
aa(lp453
VDo you have a preference?
p454
aa(lp455
V(Laughter)
p456
aa(lp457
VGood choice.
p458
aa(lp459
V(Laughter)
p460
aa(lp461
VSo you can wait for the Second Coming,
p462
aa(lp463
Vwhich is a random number between one and 500 million.
p464
aa(lp465
V(Laughter)
p466
aa(lp467
VSo really, what are we talking about here?
p468
aVOh, tech joy.
p469
aa(lp470
V(Laughter)
p471
aa(lp472
VTech joy, to me, means something, because I get a lot of joy out of tech.
p473
aVAnd in fact, making things using technology \u2014
p474
aVand I'm being serious here,
p475
aVeven though I'm using my sarcastic voice \u2014 I won't \u2014 hold on.
p476
aVMaking things, you know \u2014
p477
aVmaking things actually does give me a lot of joy.
p478
aVIt's the process of creation that keeps me
p479
aVsort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life,
p480
aVand it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project \u2014
p481
aVwhere you know you still have something to do,
p482
aVbut it's not finished, and you're not starting something \u2014
p483
aVthat really fills my entire life.
p484
aa(lp485
VAnd so, what I've done is,
p486
aa(lp487
VI started getting interested in creating online social spaces
p488
aVto share that feeling
p489
aVwith people who don't consider themselves artists.
p490
aVWe're in a culture of guru-ship.
p491
aVIt's so hard to use some software because, you know, it's unapproachable,
p492
aVpeople feel like they have to read the manual.
p493
aVSo I try to create these very minimal activities
p494
aVthat allow people to express themselves, and, hopefully \u2014
p495
aa(lp496
V("The End" by The Doors)
p497
aa(lp498
VWhoa! I'm like \u2014 on the page, but it doesn't exist.
p499
aa(lp500
V(Laughter)
p501
aa(lp502
VIt's, like \u2014 seriously, though \u2014
p503
aa(lp504
V(Laughter)
p505
aa(lp506
VI try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves.
p507
aa(lp508
V(Laughter)
p509
aa(lp510
VHere I created a contest called, "When Office Supplies Attack,"
p511
aVwhich, I think, really resonated with the working population.
p512
aa(lp513
V(Laughter)
p514
aa(lp515
VOver 500 entries in three weeks.
p516
aVToilet paper fashion.
p517
aa(lp518
V(Laughter)
p519
aa(lp520
VAgain, people from all over the country.
p521
aVThe watch is particularly incredible.
p522
aa(lp523
V(Laughter)
p524
aa(lp525
VOnline drawing tools \u2014 you've probably seen a lot of them.
p526
aVI think they're wonderful.
p527
aVIt's a chance for people to get to play with crayons
p528
aVand all that kind of stuff.
p529
aVBut I'm interested in the process of creating,
p530
aVas the real event that I'm interested in.
p531
aVAnd the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing,
p532
aVand they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure,
p533
aVawful little thing that they created.
p534
aVAnd eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it,
p535
aVor they draw penises and things like that.
p536
aa(lp537
V(Laughter)
p538
aa(lp539
VSo, the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool.
p540
aVIn other words, it's a helping tool.
p541
aVYou can draw your simple stick figure,
p542
aVand it collaborates with you to create sort of a post-war German etching.
p543
aa(lp544
V(Laughter)
p545
aa(lp546
VIn fact, it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse.
p547
aVSo, we go ahead, and we start scribbling.
p548
aVSo the idea is that you can really,
p549
aVyou know, partake in this process,
p550
aVbut watch something really crappy look beautiful.
p551
aVAnd here are some of my favorites.
p552
aVThis is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me.
p553
aVVery cool.
p554
aa(lp555
V(Laughter)
p556
aa(lp557
VDarling.
p558
aVBeautiful stuff.
p559
aVI mean this is incredible.
p560
aVAn 11-year-old girl drew this and submitted it.
p561
aVIt's just gorgeous.
p562
aa(lp563
V(Laughter)
p564

VI'm dead serious here.
p566
aVThis is not a joke.
p567
aa(lp568
V(Laughter)
p569
aa(lp570
VBut, I think it's a really fun and wonderful thing.
p571
aVSo this is called the "Fiction Project."
p572
aVThis is an online space,
p573
aVwhich is basically a refurbished message board
p574
aVthat encourages collaborative fiction writing.
p575
aVThese are haikus.
p576
aVNone of the haikus were written by the same person.
p577
aVIn fact, each line is contributed by a different person
p578
aVat a different time.
p579
aVI think that the "now tied up, tied down,
p580
aVmistress cruel approaches me, now tied down, it's up."
p581
aVIt's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,
p582
aVif you come home, and your spouse, or whoever it is,
p583
aVsays, "Let's talk" \u2014
p584
aVThat, like, chills you to the very core.
p585
aa(lp586

VBut it's peripheral activities like these
p589
aVthat allow people to get together, doing fun things.
p590
aVThey actually get to know each other,
p591
aVand it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities
p592
aVthat I think are the key to bringing up
p593
aVsome of our bonding social capital that we're lacking.
p594
aVAnd very, very quickly \u2014 I love puppets.
p595
aVHere's a puppet.
p596
aVIt dances to music.
p597
aVLotte Reiniger, an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s,
p598
aVthat started doing more elaborate things.
p599
aVI became interested in puppets,
p600
aVand I just want to show one last thing to you.
p601
aVOh, this is how you make puppets.

He defines, in many ways, the genre of online comedy, and continues to innovate madly on the form.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2006 he launched a year-long daily video blog called <em><a href=\\"http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Show with Ze Frank</a></em>, which Slate.com called &quot;the best sustained comedy run in the history of the Web.&quot; His rapid-fire delivery and absurd explorations in audience participation (like Earth Sandwich) has influenced a generation of digital native YouTubers. Perhap his most brilliant move: calling on fans to write the show for him.  Using collaborative tools, online viewers collectively put words in his  mouth (and props in his lap); he faithfully performed this wiki-comedy  each week for his &quot;Fabuloso Friday&quot; show.</p><p>In 2008, along with Erik Kastner, Frank launched Colowars, the first massively multiplayer game on <a href=\\"http://twitter.com/zefrank\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Twitter</a>, which featured two months of sponsored online events and competitions. Recently he has worked with his audience to create a series of projects based on shared emotions such as pain, fear and the pang of nostalgia. Frank works as a consultant to range of industries on audience engagement and is a public speaker on the subject of the virtual life. </p><p>In 2012 he returned to the internet airwaves with &quot;<a href=\\"http://ashow.zefrank.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">A Show</a>.&quot; About which a MetaFilter <a href=\\"http://www.metafilter.com/114710/Thats-my-Cheese-Monster-talking#4285622\\" target=\\"_blank\\">commenter</a>  wrote:</p><p>If this were a cult, I would join.<br /><br />If this were a religion, I would attend services.<br /><br />If this were a band, I would not torrent the albums, but buy them, full price, from a local independent record store.<br /><br />If this were a telethon, I would buy multiple tote bags.<br /><br />Welcome back, Ze. </p>", "slug": "ze_frank", "whotheyare": "Ze Frank rose to fame on a viral video -- in 2001!

as a party invite for 17 friends -- hit the Web in 2001, Ze Frank has been making people giggle, guffaw and gasp out loud whilst procrastinating at work. He defines, in many ways, the genre of online comedy, and continues to innovate madly on the form.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2006 he launched a year-long daily video blog called <em><a href=\\"http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Show with Ze Frank</a></em>, which Slate.com called &quot;the best sustained comedy run in the history of the Web.&quot; His rapid-fire delivery and absurd explorations in audience participation (like Earth Sandwich) has influenced a generation of digital native YouTubers. Perhap his most brilliant move: calling on fans to write the show for him.  Using collaborative tools, online viewers collectively put words in his  mouth (and props in his lap); he faithfully performed this wiki-comedy  each week for his &quot;Fabuloso Friday&quot; show.</p><p>In 2008, along with Erik Kastner, Frank launched Colowars, the first massively multiplayer game on <a href=\\"http://twitter.com/zefrank\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Twitter</a>, which featured two months of sponsored online events and competitions. Recently he has worked with his audience to create a series of projects based on shared emotions such as pain, fear and the pang of nostalgia. Frank works as a consultant to range of industries on audience engagement and is a public speaker on the subject of the virtual life. </p><p>In 2012 he returned to the internet airwaves with &quot;<a href=\\"http://ashow.zefrank.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">A Show</a>.&quot; About which a MetaFilter <a href=\\"http://www.metafilter.com/114710/Thats-my-Cheese-Monster-talking#4285622\\" target=\\"_blank\\">commenter</a>  wrote:</p><p>If this were a cult, I would join.<br /><br />If this were a religion, I would attend services.<br /><br />If this were a band, I would not torrent the albums, but buy them, full price, from a local independent record store.<br /><br />If this were a telethon, I would buy multiple tote bags.<br /><br />Welcome back, Ze. </p>", "slug": "ze_frank", "whotheyare": "Ze Frank rose to fame on a viral video -- in 2001!

VWhat is going to be the future of learning?
p5
aa(lp6
VI do have a plan,
p7
aVbut in order for me to tell you what that plan is,
p8
aVI need to tell you a little story,
p9
aVwhich kind of sets the stage.
p10
aa(lp11
VI tried to look at
p12
aVwhere did the kind of learning we do in schools,
p13
aVwhere did it come from?
p14
aVAnd you can look far back into the past,
p15
aVbut if you look at present-day schooling the way it is,
p16
aVit's quite easy to figure out where it came from.
p17
aVIt came from about 300 years ago,
p18
aVand it came from the last
p19
aVand the biggest of the empires on this planet. ["The British Empire"]
p20
aVImagine trying to run the show,
p21
aVtrying to run the entire planet,
p22
aVwithout computers, without telephones,
p23
aVwith data handwritten on pieces of paper,
p24
aVand traveling by ships.
p25
aVBut the Victorians actually did it.
p26
aVWhat they did was amazing.
p27
aVThey created a global computer
p28
aVmade up of people.
p29
aVIt's still with us today.
p30
aVIt's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.
p31
aVIn order to have that machine running,
p32
aVyou need lots and lots of people.
p33
aVThey made another machine to produce those people:
p34
aVthe school.
p35
aVThe schools would produce the people
p36
aVwho would then become parts of the
p37
aVbureaucratic administrative machine.
p38
aVThey must be identical to each other.
p39
aVThey must know three things:
p40
aVThey must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten;
p41
aVthey must be able to read;
p42
aVand they must be able to do multiplication,
p43
aVdivision, addition and subtraction in their head.
p44
aVThey must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand
p45
aVand ship them to Canada
p46
aVand he would be instantly functional.
p47
aVThe Victorians were great engineers.
p48
aVThey engineered a system that was so robust
p49
aVthat it's still with us today,
p50
aVcontinuously producing identical people
p51
aVfor a machine that no longer exists.
p52
aVThe empire is gone,
p53
aVso what are we doing with that design
p54
aVthat produces these identical people,
p55
aVand what are we going to do next
p56
aVif we ever are going to do anything else with it?
p57
aa(lp58
V["Schools as we know them are obsolete"]
p59
aa(lp60
VSo that's a pretty strong comment there.
p61
aVI said schools as we know them now, they're obsolete.
p62
aVI'm not saying they're broken.
p63
aVIt's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.
p64
aVIt's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.
p65
aVIt's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.
p66
aVWhat are the kind of jobs that we have today?
p67
aVWell, the clerks are the computers.
p68
aVThey're there in thousands in every office.
p69
aVAnd you have people who guide those computers
p70
aVto do their clerical jobs.
p71
aVThose people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand.
p72
aVThey don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.
p73
aVThey do need to be able to read.
p74
aVIn fact, they need to be able to read discerningly.
p75
aa(lp76
VWell, that's today, but we don't even know
p77
aVwhat the jobs of the future are going to look like.
p78
aVWe know that people will work from wherever they want,
p79
aVwhenever they want, in whatever way they want.
p80
aVHow is present-day schooling going to prepare them
p81
aVfor that world?
p82
aa(lp83
VWell, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident.
p84
aVI used to teach people how to write computer programs
p85
aVin New Delhi, 14 years ago.
p86
aVAnd right next to where I used to work, there was a slum.
p87
aVAnd I used to think, how on Earth are those kids
p88
aVever going to learn to write computer programs?
p89
aVOr should they not?
p90
aVAt the same time, we also had lots of parents,
p91
aVrich people, who had computers,
p92
aVand who used to tell me, "You know, my son,
p93
aVI think he's gifted,
p94
aVbecause he does wonderful things with computers.
p95
aVAnd my daughter \u2014 oh, surely she is extra-intelligent."
p96
aVAnd so on. So I suddenly figured that,
p97
aVhow come all the rich people are having
p98
aVthese extraordinarily gifted children?
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVWhat did the poor do wrong?
p101
aVI made a hole in the boundary wall
p102
aVof the slum next to my office,
p103
aVand stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen
p104
aVif I gave a computer to children who never would have one,
p105
aVdidn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was.
p106
aa(lp107
VThe children came running in.
p108
aVIt was three feet off the ground, and they said, "What is this?"
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd I said, "Yeah, it's, I don't know."
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VThey said, "Why have you put it there?"
p114
aa(lp115
VI said, "Just like that."
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd they said, "Can we touch it?"I said, "If you wish to."
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd I went away.
p120
aVAbout eight hours later,
p121
aVwe found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse.
p122
aVSo I said, "Well that's impossible, because \u2014
p123
aVHow is it possible? They don't know anything."
p124
aa(lp125
VMy colleagues said, "No, it's a simple solution.
p126
aVOne of your students must have been passing by,
p127
aVshowed them how to use the mouse."
p128
aa(lp129
VSo I said, "Yeah, that's possible."
p130
aa(lp131
VSo I repeated the experiment. I went 300 miles out of Delhi
p132
aVinto a really remote village
p133
aVwhere the chances of a passing software development engineer
p134
aVwas very little. (Laughter)
p135
aVI repeated the experiment there.
p136
aVThere was no place to stay, so I stuck my computer in,
p137
aVI went away, came back after a couple of months,
p138
aVfound kids playing games on it.
p139
aa(lp140
VWhen they saw me, they said,
p141
aV"We want a faster processor and a better mouse."
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VSo I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?"
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd they said something very interesting to me.
p148
aVIn an irritated voice, they said,
p149
aV"You've given us a machine that works only in English,
p150
aVso we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it." (Laughter)
p151
aVThat's the first time, as a teacher,
p152
aVthat I had heard the word "teach ourselves" said so casually.
p153
aa(lp154
VHere's a short glimpse from those years.
p155
aVThat's the first day at the Hole in the Wall.
p156
aVOn your right is an eight-year-old.
p157
aVTo his left is his student. She's six.
p158
aVAnd he's teaching her how to browse.
p159
aVThen onto other parts of the country,
p160
aVI repeated this over and over again,
p161
aVgetting exactly the same results that we were.
p162
aV["Hole in the wall film - 1999"]
p163
aVAn eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do.
p164
aVAnd finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is,
p165
aVand said, "There's a processor inside."
p166
aa(lp167
VSo I started publishing.
p168
aVI published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything,
p169
aVand I said, in nine months, a group of children
p170
aVleft alone with a computer in any language
p171
aVwill reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West.
p172
aVI'd seen it happen over and over and over again.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut I was curious to know, what else would they do
p175
aVif they could do this much?
p176
aVI started experimenting with other subjects,
p177
aVamong them, for example, pronunciation.
p178
aVThere's one community of children in southern India
p179
aVwhose English pronunciation is really bad,
p180
aVand they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs.
p181
aVI gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer,
p182
aVand I said, "Keep talking into it until it types what you say."
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVThey did that, and watch a little bit of this.
p185
aa(lp186
VComputer: Nice to meet you.Child: Nice to meet you.
p187
aa(lp188
VSugata Mitra: The reason I ended with the face
p189
aVof this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her.
p190
aVShe has now joined a call center in Hyderabad
p191
aVand may have tortured you about your credit card bills
p192
aVin a very clear English accent.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo then people said, well, how far will it go?
p195
aVWhere does it stop?
p196
aVI decided I would destroy my own argument
p197
aVby creating an absurd proposition.
p198
aVI made a hypothesis, a ridiculous hypothesis.
p199
aVTamil is a south Indian language, and I said,
p200
aVcan Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village
p201
aVlearn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English
p202
aVfrom a streetside computer?
p203
aVAnd I said, I'll measure them. They'll get a zero.
p204
aVI'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months,
p205
aVI'll go back, they'll get another zero.
p206
aVI'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.
p207
aVI found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India.
p208
aVI put in Hole in the Wall computers there,
p209
aVdownloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication,
p210
aVmost of which I didn't understand.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe children came rushing, said, "What's all this?"
p213
aa(lp214
VSo I said, "It's very topical, very important. But it's all in English."
p215
aa(lp216
VSo they said, "How can we understand such big English words
p217
aVand diagrams and chemistry?"
p218
aa(lp219
VSo by now, I had developed a new pedagogical method,
p220
aVso I applied that. I said, "I haven't the foggiest idea."
p221
aV(Laughter)
p222
aV"And anyway, I am going away."
p223
aV(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VSo I left them for a couple of months.
p226
aVThey'd got a zero. I gave them a test.
p227
aVI came back after two months
p228
aVand the children trooped in and said, "We've understood nothing."
p229
aa(lp230
VSo I said, "Well, what did I expect?"
p231
aVSo I said, "Okay, but how long did it take you
p232
aVbefore you decided that you can't understand anything?"
p233
aa(lp234
VSo they said, "We haven't given up.
p235
aVWe look at it every single day."
p236
aa(lp237
VSo I said, "What? You don't understand these screens
p238
aVand you keep staring at it for two months? What for?"
p239
aa(lp240
VSo a little girl who you see just now,
p241
aVshe raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English,
p242
aVshe said, "Well, apart from the fact that
p243
aVimproper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease,
p244
aVwe haven't understood anything else."
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p247
aa(lp248
VSo I tested them.
p249
aVI got an educational impossibility, zero to 30 percent
p250
aVin two months in the tropical heat
p251
aVwith a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know
p252
aVdoing something that's a decade ahead of their time.
p253
aVAbsurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm.
p254
aVThirty percent is a fail.
p255
aVHow do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks.
p256
aVI couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had,
p257
aVa 22-year-old girl who was an accountant
p258
aVand she played with them all the time.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo I asked this girl, "Can you help them?"
p261
aa(lp262
VSo she says, "Absolutely not.
p263
aVI didn't have science in school. I have no idea
p264
aVwhat they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you."
p265
aa(lp266
VI said, "I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother."
p267
aa(lp268
VSo she says, "What's that?"
p269
aa(lp270
VI said, "Stand behind them.
p271
aVWhenever they do anything, you just say,
p272
aV'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that?
p273
aVWhat's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.'
p274
aVYou know what grannies do."
p275
aa(lp276
VSo she did that for two more months.
p277
aVThe scores jumped to 50 percent.
p278
aVKallikuppam had caught up
p279
aVwith my control school in New Delhi,
p280
aVa rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher.
p281
aVWhen I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field.
p282
aa(lp283
VHere's Kallikuppam.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Children speaking) Neurons ... communication.
p286
aa(lp287
VI got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff,
p288
aVbut what she was saying, as you could make out,
p289
aVwas about neurons, with her hands were like that,
p290
aVand she was saying neurons communicate.
p291
aVAt 12.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo what are jobs going to be like?
p294
aVWell, we know what they're like today.
p295
aVWhat's learning going to be like? We know what it's like today,
p296
aVchildren pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand
p297
aVand then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand.
p298
aa(lp299
VWhat will it be tomorrow?
p300
aVCould it be that we don't need to go to school at all?
p301
aVCould it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something,
p302
aVyou can find out in two minutes?
p303
aVCould it be \u2014 a devastating question,
p304
aVa question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte \u2014
p305
aVcould it be that we are heading towards or maybe in
p306
aVa future where knowing is obsolete?
p307
aVBut that's terrible. We are homo sapiens.
p308
aVKnowing, that's what distinguishes us from the apes.
p309
aVBut look at it this way.
p310
aVIt took nature 100 million years
p311
aVto make the ape stand up
p312
aVand become Homo sapiens.
p313
aVIt took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete.
p314
aVWhat an achievement that is.
p315
aVBut we have to integrate that into our own future.
p316
aa(lp317
VEncouragement seems to be the key.
p318
aVIf you look at Kuppam,
p319
aVif you look at all of the experiments that I did,
p320
aVit was simply saying, "Wow," saluting learning.
p321
aa(lp322
VThere is evidence from neuroscience.
p323
aVThe reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain,
p324
aVwhen it's threatened, it shuts down everything else,
p325
aVit shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn,
p326
aVit shuts all of that down.
p327
aVPunishment and examinations are seen as threats.
p328
aVWe take our children, we make them shut their brains down,
p329
aVand then we say, "Perform."
p330
aVWhy did they create a system like that?
p331
aVBecause it was needed.
p332
aVThere was an age in the Age of Empires
p333
aVwhen you needed those people who can survive under threat.
p334
aVWhen you're standing in a trench all alone,
p335
aVif you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed.
p336
aVIf you didn't, you failed.
p337
aVBut the Age of Empires is gone.
p338
aVWhat happens to creativity in our age?
p339
aVWe need to shift that balance back
p340
aVfrom threat to pleasure.
p341
aa(lp342
VI came back to England looking for British grandmothers.
p343
aVI put out notices in papers saying,
p344
aVif you are a British grandmother, if you have broadband and a web camera,
p345
aVcan you give me one hour of your time per week for free?
p346
aVI got 200 in the first two weeks.
p347
aVI know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe. (Laughter)
p348
aVThey're called the Granny Cloud.
p349
aVThe Granny Cloud sits on the Internet.
p350
aVIf there's a child in trouble, we beam a Gran.
p351
aVShe goes on over Skype and she sorts things out.
p352
aVI've seen them do it from a village called Diggles
p353
aVin northwestern England,
p354
aVdeep inside a village in Tamil Nadu, India,
p355
aV6,000 miles away.
p356
aVShe does it with only one age-old gesture.
p357
aV"Shhh."
p358
aVOkay?
p359
aa(lp360
VWatch this.
p361
aa(lp362
VGrandmother: You can't catch me. You say it.
p363
aVYou can't catch me.
p364
aa(lp365
VChildren: You can't catch me.
p366
aa(lp367
VGrandmother: I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children: I'm the Gingerbread Man.
p368
aa(lp369
VGrandmother: Well done! Very good.
p370
aa(lp371
VSM: So what's happening here?
p372
aVI think what we need to look at is
p373
aVwe need to look at learning
p374
aVas the product of educational self-organization.
p375
aVIf you allow the educational process to self-organize,
p376
aVthen learning emerges.
p377
aVIt's not about making learning happen.
p378
aVIt's about letting it happen.
p379
aVThe teacher sets the process in motion
p380
aVand then she stands back in awe
p381
aVand watches as learning happens.
p382
aVI think that's what all this is pointing at.
p383
aa(lp384
VBut how will we know? How will we come to know?
p385
aVWell, I intend to build
p386
aVthese Self-Organized Learning Environments.
p387
aVThey are basically broadband, collaboration
p388
aVand encouragement put together.
p389
aVI've tried this in many, many schools.
p390
aa(lp391
VIt's been tried all over the world, and teachers
p392
aVsort of stand back and say, "It just happens by itself?"
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd I said, "Yeah, it happens by itself.""How did you know that?"
p395
aa(lp396
VI said, "You won't believe the children who told me
p397
aVand where they're from."
p398
aa(lp399
VHere's a SOLE in action.
p400
aa(lp401
V(Children talking)
p402
aa(lp403
VThis one is in England.
p404
aVHe maintains law and order,
p405
aVbecause remember, there's no teacher around.
p406
aa(lp407
VGirl: The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons \u2014 SM: Australia
p408
aVGirl: \u2014 giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge.
p409
aVThe net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons
p410
aVin the ion minus the number of electrons.
p411
aa(lp412
VSM: A decade ahead of her time.
p413
aa(lp414
VSo SOLEs, I think we need a curriculum of big questions.
p415
aVYou already heard about that. You know what that means.
p416
aVThere was a time when Stone Age men and women
p417
aVused to sit and look up at the sky and say,
p418
aV"What are those twinkling lights?"
p419
aVThey built the first curriculum, but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions.
p420
aVWe've brought it down to the tangent of an angle.
p421
aVBut that's not sexy enough.
p422
aVThe way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say,
p423
aV"If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth,
p424
aVhow would you figure out if it was going to or not?"
p425
aVAnd if he says, "Well, what? how?"
p426
aVyou say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle,"
p427
aVand leave him alone. He'll figure it out.
p428
aa(lp429
VSo here are a couple of images from SOLEs.
p430
aVI've tried incredible, incredible questions \u2014
p431
aV"When did the world begin? How will it end?" \u2014
p432
aVto nine-year-olds.
p433
aVThis one is about what happens to the air we breathe.
p434
aVThis is done by children without the help of any teacher.
p435
aVThe teacher only raises the question,
p436
aVand then stands back and admires the answer.
p437
aa(lp438
VSo what's my wish?
p439
aVMy wish is
p440
aVthat we design the future of learning.
p441
aVWe don't want to be spare parts
p442
aVfor a great human computer, do we?
p443
aVSo we need to design a future for learning.
p444
aVAnd I've got to \u2014 hang on,
p445
aVI've got to get this wording exactly right,
p446
aVbecause, you know, it's very important.
p447
aVMy wish is to help design a future of learning
p448
aVby supporting children all over the world
p449
aVto tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.
p450
aVHelp me build this school.
p451
aVIt will be called the School in the Cloud.
p452
aVIt will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures
p453
aVdriven by the big questions which their mediators put in.
p454
aVThe way I want to do this
p455
aVis to build a facility where I can study this.
p456
aVIt's a facility which is practically unmanned.
p457
aVThere's only one granny
p458
aVwho manages health and safety.
p459
aVThe rest of it's from the cloud.
p460

These famed &ldquo;Hole in the Wall&rdquo; experiments demonstrated that, in the absence of supervision and formal teaching, children can teach themselves and each other -- if they&rsquo;re motivated by curiosity.

What they saw: kids from the slum playing with the computer and, in the process, learning how to use it -- then teaching each other. These famed &ldquo;Hole in the Wall&rdquo; experiments demonstrated that, in the absence of supervision and formal teaching, children can teach themselves and each other -- if they&rsquo;re motivated by curiosity. Mitra, now a professor of educational technology at <a href=\\"http://egwestcentre.com/research/holeinthewall/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Newcastle University</a>, called it &quot;minimally invasive education.&quot;</p><p>Mitra thinks self-organized learning will shape the future of education. At TED2013, he made a bold TED Prize wish: Help me build a&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/school-in-the-cloud\\" target=\\"_blank\\">School in the Cloud</a>&nbsp;where children can explore and learn on their own -- and teach one another -- using resouces from the worldwide cloud. </p><p>The School in the Cloud now includes seven physical locations -- five in India and two in the UK. At the same time, the&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">School in the Cloud online platform</a>&nbsp;lets students participate anywhere, with partner learning labs and programs&nbsp;in countries <a href=\\"http://blog.ted.com/self-organized-learners-around-the-world-team-up-to-raise-money/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">like Colombia, Pakistan and Greece</a>. In 2016, Mitra held the first School in the Cloud conference in India. He shared that more than 16,000 SOLE sessions had taken place so far, with kids all around the world dipping their toes in this new education model.</p>", "slug": "sugata_mitra", "whotheyare": "Educational researcher Sugata Mitra is the winner of the 2013 TED Prize.

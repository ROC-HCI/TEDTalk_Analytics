VThere's a group of people in Kenya.
p5
aVPeople cross oceans to go see them.
p6
aVThese people are tall.
p7
aVThey jump high. They wear red.
p8
aVAnd they kill lions.
p9
aVYou might be wondering, who are these people?
p10
aVThese are the Maasais.
p11
aVAnd you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them.
p12
aa(lp13
VThe Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.
p14
aVThe girls are brought up to be mothers.
p15
aVWhen I was five years old,
p16
aVI found out that I was engaged
p17
aVto be married as soon as I reached puberty.
p18
aVMy mother, my grandmother, my aunties,
p19
aVthey constantly reminded me that
p20
aVyour husband just passed by.
p21
aV(Laughter) Cool, yeah?
p22
aVAnd everything I had to do from that moment
p23
aVwas to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12.
p24
aVMy day started at 5 in the morning,
p25
aVmilking the cows, sweeping the house,
p26
aVcooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood.
p27
aVI did everything that I needed to do
p28
aVto become a perfect wife.
p29
aa(lp30
VI went to school not because the Maasais'
p31
aVwomen or girls were going to school.
p32
aVIt's because my mother was denied an education,
p33
aVand she constantly reminded me and my siblings that
p34
aVshe never wanted us to live the life she was living.
p35
aVWhy did she say that?
p36
aVMy father worked as a policeman in the city.
p37
aVHe came home once a year.
p38
aVWe didn't see him for sometimes even two years.
p39
aVAnd whenever he came home, it was a different case.
p40
aVMy mother worked hard in the farm
p41
aVto grow crops so that we can eat.
p42
aVShe reared the cows and the goats
p43
aVso that she can care for us.
p44
aVBut when my father came, he would sell the cows,
p45
aVhe would sell the products we had,
p46
aVand he went and drank with his friends in the bars.
p47
aVBecause my mother was a woman,
p48
aVshe was not allowed to own any property,
p49
aVand by default, everything in my family anyway
p50
aVbelongs to my father, so he had the right.
p51
aVAnd if my mother ever questioned him,
p52
aVhe beat her, abused her, and really it was difficult.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhen I went to school, I had a dream.
p55
aVI wanted to become a teacher.
p56
aVTeachers looked nice.
p57
aVThey wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.
p58
aVI found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aVBut most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board \u2014
p61
aVnot hard work, that's what I thought,
p62
aVcompared to what I was doing in the farm.
p63
aVSo I wanted to become a teacher.
p64
aa(lp65
VI worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade,
p66
aVit was a determining factor.
p67
aVIn our tradition, there is a ceremony
p68
aVthat girls have to undergo to become women,
p69
aVand it's a rite of passage to womanhood.
p70
aVAnd then I was just finishing my eighth grade,
p71
aVand that was a transition for me to go to high school.
p72
aVThis was the crossroad.
p73
aVOnce I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.
p74
aVWell, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.
p75
aVSo I talked \u2014 I had to come up with a plan
p76
aVto figure these things out.
p77
aVI talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done.
p78
aVI told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony
p79
aVif you let me go back to school."
p80
aVThe reason why, if I ran away,
p81
aVmy father will have a stigma, people will be calling him
p82
aVthe father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony.
p83
aVIt was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.
p84
aVSo he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay,
p85
aVyou'll go to school after the ceremony."
p86
aa(lp87
VI did. The ceremony happened.
p88
aVIt's a whole week long of excitement.
p89
aVIt's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.
p90
aVAnd the day before the actual ceremony happens,
p91
aVwe were dancing, having excitement,
p92
aVand through all the night we did not sleep.
p93
aVThe actual day came, and we walked out of the house
p94
aVthat we were dancing in. Yes, we danced and danced.
p95
aVWe walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.
p96
aVThey were all in a circle.
p97
aVAnd as we danced and danced,
p98
aVand we approached this circle of women,
p99
aVmen, women, children, everybody was there.
p100
aVThere was a woman sitting in the middle of it,
p101
aVand this woman was waiting to hold us.
p102
aVI was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls,
p103
aVand as I approached her,
p104
aVshe looked at me, and I sat down.
p105
aVAnd I sat down, and I opened my legs.
p106
aVAs I opened my leg, another woman came,
p107
aVand this woman was carrying a knife.
p108
aVAnd as she carried the knife, she walked toward me
p109
aVand she held the clitoris, and she cut it off.
p110
aa(lp111
VAs you can imagine, I bled. I bled.
p112
aVAfter bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.
p113
aVIt's something that so many girls \u2014
p114
aVI'm lucky, I never died \u2014 but many die.
p115
aVIt's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife,
p116
aVand it was difficult.
p117
aVI was lucky because one, also, my mom did something
p118
aVthat most women don't do.
p119
aVThree days later, after everybody has left the home,
p120
aVmy mom went and brought a nurse.
p121
aVWe were taken care of.
p122
aVThree weeks later, I was healed, and I was back in high school.
p123
aVI was so determined to be a teacher now
p124
aVso that I could make a difference in my family.
p125
aa(lp126
VWell, while I was in high school, something happened.
p127
aVI met a young gentleman from our village
p128
aVwho had been to the University of Oregon.
p129
aVThis man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, camera,
p130
aVwhite sneakers \u2014 and I'm talking about white sneakers.
p131
aVThere is something about clothes, I think, and shoes.
p132
aVThey were sneakers, and this is in a village
p133
aVthat doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive.
p134
aa(lp135
VI told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are,"
p136
aVbecause this man looked very happy, and I admired that.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd he told me, "Well,
p139
aVwhat do you mean, you want to go?
p140
aVDon't you have a husband waiting for you?"
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd I told him, "Don't worry about that part.
p143
aVJust tell me how to get there."
p144
aa(lp145
VThis gentleman, he helped me.
p146
aVWhile I was in high school also, my dad was sick.
p147
aVHe got a stroke, and he was really, really sick,
p148
aVso he really couldn't tell me what to do next.
p149
aVBut the problem is, my father is not the only father I have.
p150
aVEverybody who is my dad's age, male in the community,
p151
aVis my father by default \u2014
p152
aVmy uncles, all of them \u2014 and they dictate what my future is.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo the news came, I applied to school
p155
aVand I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia,
p156
aVand I couldn't come without the support of the village,
p157
aVbecause I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.
p158
aVI got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here.
p159
aVBut I needed the support of the village,
p160
aVand here again, when the men heard,
p161
aVand the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school,
p162
aVthey said, "What a lost opportunity.
p163
aVThis should have been given to a boy. We can't do this."
p164
aa(lp165
VSo I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.
p166
aVThere's a belief among our people
p167
aVthat morning brings good news.
p168
aVSo I had to come up with something to do with the morning,
p169
aVbecause there's good news in the morning.
p170
aVAnd in the village also, there is one chief, an elder,
p171
aVwho if he says yes, everybody will follow him.
p172
aVSo I went to him very early in the morning, as the sun rose.
p173
aVThe first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me.
p174
aa(lp175
V"My child, what are you doing here?"
p176
aa(lp177
V"Well, Dad, I need help. Can you support me to go to America?"
p178
aVI promised him that I would be the best girl,
p179
aVI will come back, anything they wanted after that,
p180
aVI will do it for them.
p181
aa(lp182
VHe said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."
p183
aVHe gave me a list of another 15 men that I went \u2014
p184
aV16 more men \u2014 every single morning
p185
aVI went and visited them.
p186
aVThey all came together.
p187
aVThe village, the women, the men, everybody came together
p188
aVto support me to come to get an education.
p189
aa(lp190
VI arrived in America. As you can imagine, what did I find?
p191
aVI found snow!
p192
aVI found Wal-Marts, vacuum cleaners,
p193
aVand lots of food in the cafeteria.
p194
aVI was in a land of plenty.
p195
aa(lp196
VI enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here,
p197
aVI discovered a lot of things.
p198
aVI learned that that ceremony that I went through
p199
aVwhen I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.
p200
aVI learned that it was against the law in Kenya.
p201
aVI learned that I did not have to trade part of my body
p202
aVto get an education. I had a right.
p203
aVAnd as we speak right now, three million girls
p204
aVin Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.
p205
aVI learned that my mom had a right to own property.
p206
aVI learned that she did not have to be abused
p207
aVbecause she is a woman.
p208
aVThose things made me angry.
p209
aVI wanted to do something.
p210
aVAs I went back, every time I went,
p211
aVI found that my neighbors' girls were getting married.
p212
aVThey were getting mutilated, and here,
p213
aVafter I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N.,
p214
aVI went back to school to get my graduate work,
p215
aVthe constant cry of these girls was in my face.
p216
aVI had to do something.
p217
aa(lp218
VAs I went back, I started talking to the men,
p219
aVto the village, and mothers, and I said,
p220
aV"I want to give back the way I had promised you
p221
aVthat I would come back and help you. What do you need?"
p222
aa(lp223
VAs I spoke to the women, they told me,
p224
aV"You know what we need? We really need a school for girls."
p225
aVBecause there had not been any school for girls.
p226
aVAnd the reason they wanted the school for girls
p227
aVis because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school,
p228
aVthe mother is blamed for that.
p229
aVIf she got pregnant before she got married,
p230
aVthe mother is blamed for that, and she's punished.
p231
aVShe's beaten.
p232
aVThey said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place."
p233
aa(lp234
VAs we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers,
p235
aVthe fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said:
p236
aV"We want a school for boys."
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village
p239
aVwho have been out and they have gotten an education.
p240
aVWhy can't they build a school for boys,
p241
aVand I'll build a school for girls?"
p242
aVThat made sense. And they agreed.
p243
aVAnd I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.
p244
aVAnd they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school.
p245
aVWe have.
p246
aa(lp247
VI want you to meet one of the girls in that school.
p248
aVAngeline came to apply for the school,
p249
aVand she did not meet any criteria that we had.
p250
aVShe's an orphan. Yes, we could have taken her for that.
p251
aVBut she was older. She was 12 years old,
p252
aVand we were taking girls who were in fourth grade.
p253
aVAngeline had been moving from one place \u2014
p254
aVbecause she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father \u2014
p255
aVmoving from one grandmother's house to another one,
p256
aVfrom aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life.
p257
aVAnd I looked at her, I remember that day,
p258
aVand I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.
p259
aVAnd yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.
p260
aVWe gave her the opportunity to come to the class.
p261
aVFive months later, that is Angeline.
p262
aVA transformation had begun in her life.
p263
aVAngeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world
p264
aVand make a difference.
p265
aVShe was not the top student when we took her.
p266
aVNow she's the best student, not just in our school,
p267
aVbut in the entire division that we are in.
p268
aVThat's Sharon. That's five years later.
p269
aVThat's Evelyn. Five months later, that is the difference that we are making.
p270
aa(lp271
VAs a new dawn is happening in my school,
p272
aVa new beginning is happening.
p273
aVAs we speak right now, 125 girls will never be mutilated.
p274
aVOne hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they're 12 years old.
p275
aVOne hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.
p276
aVThis is the thing that we are doing,
p277
aVgiving them opportunities where they can rise.
p278
aVAs we speak right now, women are not being beaten
p279
aVbecause of the revolutions we've started in our community.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Applause)
p282
aa(lp283
VI want to challenge you today.
p284
aVYou are listening to me because you are here,
p285
aVvery optimistic.
p286
aVYou are somebody who is so passionate.
p287
aVYou are somebody who wants to see a better world.
p288
aVYou are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty.
p289
aVYou are somebody who wants to make a difference.
p290
aVYou are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better.
p291
aVI want to challenge you today that to be the first,
p292
aVbecause people will follow you.
p293
aVBe the first. People will follow you.
p294
aVBe bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident.
p295
aVMove out, because as you change your world,
p296
aVas you change your community,
p297
aVas we believe that we are impacting one girl, one family,
p298
aVone village, one country at a time.
p299
aVWe are making a difference, so if you change your world,
p300
aVyou are going to change your community,
p301
aVyou are going to change your country,
p302
aVand think about that. If you do that, and I do that,
p303
aVaren't we going to create a better future for our children,
p304
aVfor your children, for our grandchildren?
p305
aVAnd we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much.

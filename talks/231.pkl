VI'm going to go right into the slides.
p5
aVAnd all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides
p6
aVis that I do just very straight stuff.
p7
aVAnd my ideas are \u2014
p8
aVin my head, anyway \u2014 they're very logical
p9
aVand relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients.
p10
aVI either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems,
p11
aVor I really do solve their problems,
p12
aVbecause usually they seem to like it.
p13
aa(lp14
VLet me go right into the slides.
p15
aVCan you turn off the light? Down.
p16
aVI like to be in the dark.
p17
aVI don't want you to see what I'm doing up here.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VAnyway, I did this house in Santa Monica,
p22
aVand it got a lot of notoriety.
p23
aVIn fact, it appeared in a porno comic book,
p24
aVwhich is the slide on the right.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VThis is in Venice.
p29
aVI just show it because I want you to know
p30
aVI'm concerned about context.
p31
aVOn the left-hand side,
p32
aVI had the context of those little houses,
p33
aVand I tried to build a building that fit into that context.
p34
aVWhen people take pictures of these buildings out of that context
p35
aVthey look really weird,
p36
aVand my premise is that they make a lot more sense
p37
aVwhen they're photographed or seen in that space.
p38
aVAnd then, once I deal with the context,
p39
aVI then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene,
p40
aVas I hope you'll find that slide on the right.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.
p43
aVI was concerned about making a place for the study of law.
p44
aVAnd we continue to work with this client.
p45
aVThe building on the right at the top is now under construction.
p46
aVThe garage on the right \u2014 the gray structure \u2014 will be torn down,
p47
aVfinally, and several small classrooms will be placed
p48
aValong this avenue that we've created, this campus.
p49
aVAnd it all related to the clients and the students
p50
aVfrom the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.
p51
aVThey wanted a sense of place.
p52
aVAnd so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space
p53
aVin downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.
p54
aVAnd it was my theory, or my point of view,
p55
aVthat one didn't upstage the neighborhood \u2014
p56
aVone made accommodations.
p57
aVI tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood,
p58
aVwhether they were buildings I liked or not.
p59
aa(lp60
VIn the '60s I started working with paper furniture
p61
aVand made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's.
p62
aVWe even made flooring, walls and everything, out of cardboard.
p63
aVAnd the success of it threw me for a loop.
p64
aVI couldn't deal with the success of furniture \u2014
p65
aVI wasn't secure enough as an architect \u2014
p66
aVand so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VSo, nobody would like this.
p71
aVAnd it was in this, preliminary to these pieces of furniture,
p72
aVthat Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice.
p73
aVAnd after we failed, I just kept failing.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VThe piece on the left \u2014
p78
aVand that ultimately led to the piece on the right \u2014
p79
aVhappened when the kid that was working on this
p80
aVtook one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up
p81
aVto put it in the wastebasket.
p82
aVAnd I put a piece of tape around it,
p83
aVas you see there, and realized you could sit on it,
p84
aVand it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.
p85
aVSo, it was an accidental discovery.
p86
aa(lp87
VI got into fish.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VI mean, the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism \u2014 at po-mo \u2014
p92
aVand said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man,
p93
aVand if you're going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning.
p94
aVAnd so I started making these funny things.
p95
aVAnd they started to have a life of their own and got bigger \u2014
p96
aVas the one glass at the Walker.
p97
aVAnd then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything
p98
aVand tried to translate what I was learning
p99
aVabout the form of the fish and the movement.
p100
aVAnd a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it \u2014
p101
aVaccidental, again \u2014
p102
aVit was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it,
p103
aVand made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal.
p104
aa(lp105
VI did this building in Japan.
p106
aVI was taken out to dinner after the contract
p107
aVfor this little restaurant was signed.
p108
aVAnd I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff.
p109
aVAnd after I got \u2014 I was really drunk \u2014
p110
aVI was asked to do some sketches on napkins.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd I made some sketches on napkins \u2014
p115
aVlittle boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do.
p116
aVAnd the client said, "Why no fish?"
p117
aVAnd so I made a drawing with a fish, and I left Japan.
p118
aVThree weeks later, I received a complete set of drawings
p119
aVsaying we'd won the competition.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, it's hard to do. It's hard to translate a fish form,
p124
aVbecause they're so beautiful \u2014 perfect \u2014
p125
aVinto a building or object like this.
p126
aVAnd Oldenburg, who I work with a little once in a while,
p127
aVtold me I couldn't do it, and so that made it even more exciting.
p128
aVBut he was right \u2014 I couldn't do the tail.
p129
aVI started to get the head OK, but the tail I couldn't do.
p130
aVIt was pretty hard.
p131
aVThe thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.
p132
aVAnd I put them together, and you walk between them.
p133
aVIt was a dialog with the context again.
p134
aVNow, if you saw a picture of this
p135
aVas it was published in Architectural Record \u2014
p136
aVthey didn't show the context, so you would think,
p137
aV"God, what a pushy guy this is."
p138
aVBut a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here
p139
aVlooking for this restaurant.
p140
aVCouldn't find it.
p141
aVSo ...
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VAs for craft and technology and all those things
p146
aVthat you've all been talking about, I was thrown for a complete loop.
p147
aVThis was built in six months.
p148
aVThe way we sent drawings to Japan:
p149
aVwe used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models,
p150
aVand we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.
p151
aVWe made the drawings of the fish and the scales.
p152
aVAnd when I got there, everything was perfect \u2014
p153
aVexcept the tail.
p154
aVSo, I decided to cut off the head and the tail.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker.
p157
aVAnd it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made, I think.
p158
aVAnd then Jay Chiat, a friend and client,
p159
aVasked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.
p160
aVFor reasons we don't want to talk about, it got delayed.
p161
aVToxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one.
p162
aVAnd so we built a temporary building \u2014 I'm getting good at temporary \u2014
p163
aVand we put a conference room in that's a fish.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd, finally, Jay dragged me to my hometown, Toronto, Canada.
p166
aVAnd there is a story \u2014 it's a real story \u2014 about my grandmother
p167
aVbuying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home,
p168
aVputting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.
p169
aVI played with it in the evening.
p170
aVWhen I went to sleep, the next day it wasn't there.
p171
aVAnd the next night, we had gefilte fish.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd so I set up this interior for Jay's offices
p176
aVand I made a pedestal for a sculpture.
p177
aVAnd he didn't buy a sculpture, so I made one.
p178
aVI went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's,
p179
aVand I put the fish in.
p180
aVIt was a joke.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VI play with funny people like [Claes] Oldenburg.
p185
aVWe've been friends for a long time.
p186
aVAnd we've started to work on things.
p187
aVA few years ago, we did a performance piece in Venice, Italy,
p188
aVcalled "Il Corso del Coltello" \u2014 the Swiss Army knife.
p189
aVAnd most of the imagery is \u2014
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VClaes', but those two little boys are my sons,
p194
aVand they were Claes' assistants in the play.
p195
aVHe was the Swiss Army knife.
p196
aVHe was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter,
p197
aVand I was Frankie P. Toronto.
p198
aVP for Palladio.
p199
aVDressed up like the AT&T building by Claes \u2014
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
Vwith a fish hat.
p204
aVThe highlight of the performance was at the end.
p205
aVThis beautiful object, the Swiss Army knife,
p206
aVwhich I get credit for participating in.
p207
aVAnd I can tell you \u2014 it's totally an Oldenburg.
p208
aVI had nothing to do with it.
p209
aVThe only thing I did was, I made it possible for them
p210
aVto turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal,
p211
aVbecause I love sailing.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VWe made it into a sailing craft.
p216
aa(lp217
VI've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing.
p218
aVI do it because it's a curious thing in the culture,
p219
aVwhen things are made in such great quantities,
p220
aVabsorbed in such great quantities,
p221
aVand there's so much denial about them.
p222
aVPeople hate it.
p223
aVAnd I'm fascinated with that, which, like the paper furniture \u2014
p224
aVit's one of those materials.
p225
aVAnd I'm always drawn to that.
p226
aVAnd so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link,
p227
aVwhich nobody will forgive me for.
p228
aVBut Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School.
p229
aVAnd that chain link is really expensive.
p230
aVIt's in perspective and everything.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd then we did a camp together for children with cancer.
p233
aVAnd you can see, we started making a building together.
p234
aVOf course, the milk can is his.
p235
aVBut we were trying to collide our ideas,
p236
aVto put objects next to each other.
p237
aVLike a Morandi \u2014 like the little bottles \u2014 composing them like a still life.
p238
aVAnd it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together.
p239
aa(lp240
VThen Jay Chiat asked me to do this building
p241
aVon this funny lot in Venice, and I started with this three-piece thing,
p242
aVand you entered in the middle.
p243
aVAnd Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle.
p244
aVAnd he pushed that.
p245
aVAnd one day I had a \u2014 oh, well, the other way.
p246
aVI had the binoculars from Claes, and I put them there,
p247
aVand I could never get rid of them after that.
p248
aVOldenburg made the binoculars incredible
p249
aVwhen he sent me the first model of the real proposal.
p250
aVIt made my building look sick.
p251
aVAnd it was this interaction between
p252
aVthat kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting.
p253
aVIt led to the building on the left.
p254
aVAnd I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars, you know,
p255
aVleaving out the \u2014 what the hell.
p256
aa(lp257
VI use a lot of metal in my work,
p258
aVand I have a hard time connecting with the craft.
p259
aVThe whole thing about my house,
p260
aVthe whole use of rough carpentry and everything,
p261
aVwas the frustration with the crafts available.
p262
aVI said, "If I can't get the craft that I want,
p263
aVI'll use the craft I can get."
p264
aVThere were plenty of models for that,
p265
aVin Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists
p266
aVwho were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.
p267
aVI went into the metal because it was a way of building a building
p268
aVthat was a sculpture.
p269
aVAnd it was all of one material,
p270
aVand the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.
p271
aVThe metalworkers, for the most part,
p272
aVdo ducts behind the ceilings and stuff.
p273
aVI was given an opportunity to design an exhibit
p274
aVfor the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington,
p275
aVand I did it on the condition that they become my partners
p276
aVin the future and help me with all future metal buildings, etc. etc.
p277
aVAnd it's working very well
p278
aVto have these people, these craftsmen, interested in it.
p279
aVI just tell the stories.
p280
aVIt's a way of connecting, at least, with some of those people
p281
aVthat are so important to the realization of architecture.
p282
aa(lp283
VThe metal continued into a building \u2014 Herman Miller, in Sacramento.
p284
aVAnd it's just a complex of factory buildings.
p285
aVAnd Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place \u2014
p286
aVa people place.
p287
aVI mean, it's kind of a trite thing to say,
p288
aVbut it is real that they wanted to have a central place
p289
aVwhere the cafeteria would be, where the people would come
p290
aVand where the people working would interact.
p291
aVSo it's out in the middle of nowhere, and you approach it.
p292
aVIt's copper and galvanize.
p293
aVI used the galvanize and copper
p294
aVin a very light gauge, so it would buckle.
p295
aVI spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic.
p296
aVEverybody's trying to get the panels perfect,
p297
aVand I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy.
p298
aVAnd they end up looking like stone.
p299
aVThis is the central area.
p300
aVThere's a ramp.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman.
p303
aVStanley was instrumental in my getting this job.
p304
aVAnd when I was awarded the contract I, at the very beginning,
p305
aVasked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me.
p306
aVBecause these were ideas that we were talking about,
p307
aVbuilding things next to each other, making \u2014
p308
aVit's all about [a] metaphor for a city, maybe.
p309
aVAnd so Stanley did the little dome thing.
p310
aVAnd we did it over the phone and by fax.
p311
aVHe would send me a fax and show me something.
p312
aVHe'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower.
p313
aVI told him, "No, no, that's too ongepotchket.
p314
aVI don't want the tower."
p315
aVSo he came back with a simpler building,
p316
aVbut he put some funny details on it,
p317
aVand he moved it closer to my building.
p318
aVAnd so I decided to put him in a depression.
p319
aVI put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in.
p320
aVAnd so then he put two bridges \u2014 this all happened on the fax,
p321
aVgoing back and forth over a couple of weeks' period.
p322
aVAnd he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it.
p323
aVAnd so then I put this big billboard behind it.
p324
aVAnd I call it, "David and Goliath."
p325
aVAnd that's my cafeteria.
p326
aa(lp327
VIn Boston, we had that old building on the left.
p328
aVIt was a very prominent building off the freeway,
p329
aVand we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up
p330
aVand used the kind of \u2014 I thought \u2014 the language of the neighborhood,
p331
aVwhich had these cornices, projecting cornices.
p332
aVMine got a little exuberant, but I used lead copper,
p333
aVwhich is a beautiful material, and it turns green in 100 years.
p334
aVInstead of, like, copper in 10 or 15.
p335
aVWe redid the side of the building
p336
aVand re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space.
p337
aVAnd it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved,
p338
aVbecause they have very strict kind of design guideline,
p339
aVand they wouldn't normally think I would fit them.
p340
aVThe detailing was very careful with the lead copper
p341
aVand making panels and fitting it tightly
p342
aVinto the fabric of the existing building.
p343
aa(lp344
VIn Barcelona, on Las Ramblas for some film festival,
p345
aVI did the Hollywood sign going and coming,
p346
aVmade a building out of it, and they built it.
p347
aVI flew in one night and took this picture.
p348
aVBut they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica \u2014
p351
aVa little shopping center.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa,
p354
aVin which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back.
p355
aVIt's the support labs, which, by some coincidence, required no windows.
p356
aVAnd the shape fit perfectly.
p357
aVI just joined the points.
p358
aVIn the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment.
p359
aVThat solid wall behind it is a pipe chase \u2014 a pipe canyon \u2014
p360
aVand so it was an opportunity that I seized,
p361
aVbecause I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form.
p362
aVIt gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it.
p363
aa(lp364
VThis is a small house somewhere.
p365
aVThey've been building it so long I don't remember where it is.
p366
aVIt's in the West Valley.
p367
aVAnd we started with the stream
p368
aVand built the house along the stream \u2014 dammed it up to make a lake.
p369
aVThese are the models.
p370
aVThe reality, with the lake \u2014
p371
aVthe workmanship is pretty bad.
p372
aVAnd it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house.
p373
aVWhen you have to do something really cheaply,
p374
aVit's hard to get perfect corners and stuff.
p375
aVThat big metal thing is a passage, and in it is \u2014
p376
aVyou go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom,
p377
aVwhich is on the right.
p378
aVIt's kind of like a whole built town.
p379
aa(lp380
VI was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale.
p381
aVI thought it was fitting for me to be doing that.
p382
aa(lp383
VThis is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota.
p384
aVThe owners had a dilemma \u2014 they asked Philip to do it.
p385
aVHe was too busy.
p386
aVHe didn't recommend me, by the way.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Laughter)
p389
aa(lp390
VWe ended up having to make it a sculpture, because the dilemma was,
p391
aVhow do you build a building that doesn't look like the language?
p392
aVIs it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided?
p393
aVEtc. etc.
p394
aVYou've got the idea.
p395
aVAnd so we finally ended up making it.
p396
aVThese people are art collectors.
p397
aVAnd we finally made it so it appears very sculptural
p398
aVfrom the main house and all the windows are on the other side.
p399
aVAnd the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.
p400
aVIt's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply \u2014
p401
aVit's that formed lumber from Finland.
p402
aVWe used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.
p403
aVI keep trying to make it work.
p404
aVIn this case we learned how to detail it.
p405
aa(lp406
VIn Cleveland, there's Burnham Mall, on the left.
p407
aVIt's never been finished.
p408
aVGoing out to the lake, you can see all those new buildings we built.
p409
aVAnd we had the opportunity to build a building on this site.
p410
aVThere's a railroad track.
p411
aVThis is the city hall over here somewhere, and the courthouse.
p412
aVAnd the centerline of the mall goes out.
p413
aVBurnham had designed a railroad station that was never built,
p414
aVand so we followed.
p415
aVSohio is on the axis here,
p416
aVand we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts.
p417
aVAnd this is our building,
p418
aVwhich is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company.
p419
aVWe collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top, folded.
p420
aVThe health club is fastened to the garage
p421
aVwith a C-clamp, for Cleveland.
p422
aa(lp423
V(Laughter)
p424
aa(lp425
VYou drive down.
p426
aVSo it's about a 10-story C-clamp.
p427
aVAnd all this stuff at the bottom is a museum,
p428
aVand an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.
p429
aVThis owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.
p430
aVAnd this would be a hotel.
p431
aVSo, the centerline of this thing \u2014 we'd preserve it,
p432
aVand it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings
p433
aVby Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.
p434
aVIt's hard to do high-rise.
p435
aVI feel much more comfortable down here.
p436
aa(lp437
VThis is a piece of property in Brentwood.
p438
aVAnd a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house \u2014
p439
aVI designed a house for myself
p440
aVthat would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard \u2014
p441
aVand the owner of this lot worked for me
p442
aVand built that actual model on the left.
p443
aVAnd she came back,
p444
aVI guess wealthier or something \u2014 something happened \u2014
p445
aVand asked me to design a house for her on this site.
p446
aVAnd following that basic idea of the village,
p447
aVwe changed it as we got into it.
p448
aVI locked the house into the site by cutting the back end \u2014
p449
aVhere you see on the photographs of the site \u2014
p450
aVslicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms
p451
aVlike a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom,
p452
aVwhich I designed like a kind of a barge,
p453
aVlooking like a boat.
p454
aVAnd that's it, built.
p455
aVThe dome was a request from the client.
p456
aVShe wanted a dome somewhere in the house.
p457
aVShe didn't care where.
p458
aVWhen you sleep in this bedroom, I hope \u2014
p459
aVI mean, I haven't slept in it yet.
p460
aVI've offered to marry her so I could sleep there,
p461
aVbut she said I didn't have to do that.
p462
aVBut when you're in that room,
p463
aVyou feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.
p464
aVAnd it's very private.
p465
aVThe landscape is being built around to create a private garden.
p466
aVAnd then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room,
p467
aVand one on the other side.
p468
aa(lp469
VThese aren't focused very well.
p470
aVI don't know how to do it from here.
p471
aVFocus the one on the right.
p472
aVIt's up there.
p473
aVLeft \u2014 it's my right.
p474
aa(lp475
VAnyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees.
p476
aVThat's the living room.
p477
aVServants' quarters.
p478
aVA guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.
p479
aVAnd then you enter into the living room and then so on.
p480
aVThis is the bedroom.
p481
aVYou come down from this level along the stairway,
p482
aVand you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.
p483
aVAnd the bed is back in this space,
p484
aVwith windows looking out onto the lake.
p485
aVThese Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground
p486
aVand to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.
p487
aVThe material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.
p488
aVAnd so it was an intent to make this small piece of land \u2014
p489
aVit's 100 by 250 \u2014 into a kind of an estate by separating these areas
p490
aVand making the living room and dining room into this pavilion
p491
aVwith a high space in it.
p492
aVAnd this happened by accident that I got this right on axis
p493
aVwith the dining room table.
p494
aVIt looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.
p495
aVBut the idea is, the windows are all placed
p496
aVso you see pieces of the house outside.
p497
aVEventually this will be screened \u2014 these trees will come up \u2014
p498
aVand it will be very private.
p499
aVAnd you feel like you're in your own kind of village.
p500
aa(lp501
VThis is for Michael Eisner \u2014 Disney.
p502
aVWe're doing some work for him.
p503
aa(lp504
VAnd this is in Anaheim, California, and it's a freeway building.
p505
aVYou go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour,
p506
aVand there's another bridge here.
p507
aVAnd you're through this room in a split second,
p508
aVand the building will sort of reflect that.
p509
aVOn the backside, it's much more humane \u2014 entrance,
p510
aVdining hall, etc.
p511
aVAnd then this thing here \u2014 I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear
p512
aVthe picket fence effect of the sound hitting it.
p513
aVKind of a fun thing to do.
p514
aa(lp515
VI'm doing a building in Switzerland, Basel,
p516
aVwhich is an office building for a furniture company.
p517
aVAnd we struggled with the image.
p518
aVThese are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture
p519
aVto normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy,
p520
aVthen people might say, "Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing,
p521
aVbut no, it ain't going to look good in my normal building."
p522
aVSo we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here,
p523
aVand we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them
p524
aVso that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.
p525
aVAnd you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of
p526
aVinteraction between these pieces.
p527
aa(lp528
VThis is in Paris, along the Seine.
p529
aVPalais des Sports, the Gare de Lyon over here.
p530
aVThe Minister of Finance \u2014 the guy that moved from the Louvre \u2014 goes in here.
p531
aVThere's a new library across the river.
p532
aVAnd back in here, in this already treed park,
p533
aVwe're doing a very dense building called the American Center,
p534
aVwhich has a theater, apartments, dance school, an art museum,
p535
aVrestaurants and all kinds of \u2014 it's a very dense program \u2014
p536
aVbookstores, etc.
p537
aVIn a very tight, small \u2014
p538
aVthis is the ground level.
p539
aVAnd the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up
p540
aVby taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off.
p541
aVThey call it the plan coupe.
p542
aVAnd I struggled with that thing \u2014
p543
aVhow to get around the corner.
p544
aa(lp545
VThese are the models for it.
p546
aVI showed you the other model, the one \u2014
p547
aVthis is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing \u2014
p548
aVso I understood the problem.
p549
aVI was trying to get around this plan coupe \u2014 how do you do it?
p550
aVApartments, etc.
p551
aVAnd these are the kind of study models we did.
p552
aVAnd the one on the left is pretty awful.
p553
aVYou can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.
p554
aVBut out of it came finally this resolution, where the elevator piece
p555
aVworked frontally to this, parallel to this street,
p556
aVand also parallel to here.
p557
aVAnd then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt,
p558
aVkind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer.
p559
aVThe restaurants here \u2014 the apartments and the theater, etc.
p560
aVSo it would all be built in stone, in French limestone,
p561
aVexcept for this metal piece.
p562
aVAnd it faces into a park.
p563
aVAnd the idea was to make this express the energy of this.
p564
aVOn the side facing the street it's much more normal,
p565
aVexcept I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point,
p566
aVthese housing units made a gesture to the corner.
p567
aVAnd this will be some kind of high-tech billboard.
p568
aVIf any of you guys have any ideas for it, please contact me.
p569
aVI don't know what to do.
p570
aa(lp571
VJay Chiat is a glutton for punishment, and he hired me
p572
aVto do a house for him in the Hamptons.
p573
aVAnd it's got a fish.
p574
aVAnd I keep thinking, "This is going to be the last fish."
p575
aVIt's like a drug addict.
p576
aVI say, "I'm not going to do it anymore \u2014 I don't want to do it anymore \u2014
p577
aVI'm not going to do it."
p578
aVAnd then I do it.
p579
aa(lp580
V(Laughter)
p581
aa(lp582
VThere it is.
p583
aVBut it's the living room.
p584
aVAnd this piece here is \u2014
p585
aVI don't know what it is.
p586
aVI just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget
p587
aVso we could take something out.
p588
aa(lp589
V(Applause)
p590
aa(lp591
VThis is Euro Disney, and I've worked with all of the guys
p592
aVthat presented to you earlier.
p593
aVWe've had a lot of fun working together.
p594
aVI think I'm from Mars for them, and they are for me,
p595
aVbut somehow we all manage to work together,
p596
aVand I think, productively.
p597
aVSo far.
p598
aVThis is a shopping thing.
p599
aVYou come into the Magic Kingdom
p600
aVand the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here.
p601
aVAnd then this is a kind of a shopping mall,
p602
aVwith a rodeo and restaurants.
p603
aVAnd another restaurant.
p604
aVWhat I did \u2014 because of the Paris skies being quite dull,
p605
aVI made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station,
p606
aVto the route of the train.
p607
aVIt looks like it's kind of been there,
p608
aVand then crashed all these simpler forms into it.
p609
aVThe light grid will have a light, be lit up at night and give a
p610
aVkind of light ceiling.
p611
aVIn Switzerland \u2014 Germany, actually \u2014 on the Rhine across from Basel,
p612
aVwe did a furniture factory and a furniture museum.
p613
aa(lp614
VAnd I tried to \u2014 there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here,
p615
aVthere's an Oldenburg sculpture over here \u2014
p616
aVI tried to make a relationship urbanistically.
p617
aVAnd I don't gave good slides to show \u2014 it's just been completed \u2014
p618
aVbut this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here.
p619
aVAnd as you pass by it's always part \u2014 you see it as all of these pieces
p620
aVaccrue and become part of an overall neighborhood.
p621
aVIt's plaster and just zinc.
p622
aVAnd you wonder, if this is a museum,
p623
aVwhat it's going to be like inside?
p624
aVIf it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything,
p625
aVand just wait.
p626
aVI'm so cunning and clever \u2014 I made it quiet and wonderful.
p627
aVBut on the outside it does scream out at you a bit.
p628
aVIt's actually basically three square rooms
p629
aVwith a couple of skylights and stuff.
p630
aVAnd from the building in the back, you see it as
p631
aVan iceberg floating by in the hills.
p632
aVI know I'm over time.
p633
aVSee, that skylight goes down and becomes that one.
p634
aVSo it's pretty quiet inside.
p635
aa(lp636
VThis is the Disney Hall \u2014 the concert hall.
p637
aVIt's a complicated project.
p638
aVIt has a chamber hall.
p639
aVIt's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built
p640
aVwith a lot of love and tears and caring.
p641
aVAnd it's not a great building, but I approached it optimistically,
p642
aVthat we would make a compositional relationship between us
p643
aVthat would strengthen both of us.
p644
aVAnd the plan of this \u2014 it's a concert hall.
p645
aVThis is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.
p646
aVThere's commercial at the ground floor.
p647
aVThese are offices, which, really, in the competition,
p648
aVwe didn't have to design.
p649
aVBut finally, there's a hotel there.
p650
aVThese were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler,
p651
aVcomposing these elevations together and relating them
p652
aVto the buildings that existed \u2014 to MOCA, etc.
p653
aa(lp654
VThe acoustician in the competition gave us criteria,
p655
aVwhich led to this compartmentalized scheme,
p656
aVwhich we found out after the competition would not work at all.
p657
aVBut everybody liked these forms and liked the space,
p658
aVand so that's one of the problems of a competition.
p659
aVYou have to then try and get that back in some way.
p660
aVAnd we studied many models.
p661
aVThis was our original model.
p662
aVThese were the three buildings that were the ideal \u2014
p663
aVthe Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.
p664
aVEverybody liked the surround.
p665
aVActually, this is the smallest hall in size,
p666
aVand it has more seats than any of these
p667
aVbecause it has double balconies.
p668
aVOur client doesn't want balconies, so \u2014
p669
aVand when we met our new acoustician, he told us
p670
aVthis was the right shape or this was the right shape.
p671
aVAnd we tried many shapes, trying to get the energy
p672
aVof the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format.
p673
aVWe finally settled on a shape that was
p674
aVthe proportion of the Concertgebouw
p675
aVwith the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician said
p676
aVwere crucial to this and later decided they weren't,
p677
aVbut now we have them.
p678
aa(lp679
V(Laughter)
p680
aa(lp681
VAnd our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural
p682
aVand out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.
p683
aVThat's the idea.
p684
aVAnd the corners would have skylights
p685
aVand these columns would be structural.
p686
aVAnd the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a
p687
aVkind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit,
p688
aVand create intimacy.
p689
aVNow, this is not a final design \u2014 these are just on the way to being \u2014
p690
aVand so I wouldn't take it literally, except the feeling of the space.
p691
aVWe studied the acoustics with laser stuff,
p692
aVand they bounce them off this and see where it all works.
p693
aVBut you get the sense of the hall in section.
p694
aVMost halls come straight down into a proscenium.
p695
aVIn this case we're opening it back up
p696
aVand getting skylights in the four corners.
p697
aVAnd so it will be quite a different shape.
p698
aa(lp699
V(Laughter)
p700
aa(lp701
VThe original building, because it was frog-like,
p702
aVfit nicely on the site and cranked itself well.
p703
aVWhen you get into a box, it's harder to do it \u2014 and here we are,
p704
aVstruggling with how to put the hotel in.
p705
aVAnd this is a teapot I designed for Alessi.
p706
aVI just stuck it on there.
p707
aVBut this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it
p708
aVand struggle with it and cut it away.
p709
aVAnd of course it's not going to look like that,
p710
aVbut it is the crazy way I tend to work.
p711
aa(lp712
VAnd then finally, in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture
p713
aVat the foot of Interstate Bank Tower, the highest building in L.A.
p714
aVLarry Halprin is doing the stairs.
p715
aVAnd I was asked to do a fish, and so I did a snake.
p716
aa(lp717
V(Laughter)
p718
aa(lp719
VIt's a public space, and I made it kind of a garden structure,
p720
aVand you can go in it.
p721
aVIt's a kiva, and Larry's putting some water in there,
p722
aVand it works much better than a fish.
p723
aa(lp724
VIn Barcelona I was asked to do a fish, and we're working on that,
p725
aVat the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by
p726
aVSkidmore, Owings and Merrill.
p727
aVAnd the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel,
p728
aVnon-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.
p729
aVAnd so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it,
p730
aVperverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of
p731
aVa 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit \u2014
p732
aVthis is the beach and the harbor out in front,
p733
aVand this is really a shopping center with department stores.
p734
aVAnd we split these bridges.
p735
aVOriginally, this was all solid with a hole in it.
p736
aVWe cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of
p737
aVa foreground for this hotel.
p738
aVWe showed this to the hotel people the other day,
p739
aVand they were terrified and said that nobody would come
p740
aVto the Ritz-Carlton anymore, because of this fish.
p741
aa(lp742
V(Laughter)
p743
aa(lp744
VAnd finally, I just threw these in \u2014 Lou Danziger.
p745
aVI didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here,
p746
aVbut this is a building I did for him in 1964, I think.
p747
aVA little studio \u2014 and it's sadly for sale.
p748
aVTime goes on.
p749
aa(lp750
VAnd this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing.
p751
aVHe designed the robot as the cashier, and the head moves,
p752
aVand I did the rest of it.
p753
aVAnd the food wasn't as good as the stuff, and so it failed.
p754
aVIt should have been the other way around \u2014
p755
aVthe food should have been good first.
p756
aVIt didn't work.
p757
aa(lp758
VThank you very much.

VIn the early days of Twitter, it was like a place of radical de-shaming.
p5
aVPeople would admit shameful secrets about themselves,
p6
aVand other people would say, "Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."
p7
aVVoiceless people realized that they had a voice,
p8
aVand it was powerful and eloquent.
p9
aVIf a newspaper ran some racist or homophobic column,
p10
aVwe realized we could do something about it.
p11
aVWe could get them.
p12
aVWe could hit them with a weapon that we understood but they didn't \u2014
p13
aVa social media shaming.
p14
aVAdvertisers would withdraw their advertising.
p15
aVWhen powerful people misused their privilege,
p16
aVwe were going to get them.
p17
aVThis was like the democratization of justice.
p18
aVHierarchies were being leveled out.
p19
aVWe were going to do things better.
p20
aa(lp21
VSoon after that, a disgraced pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer \u2014
p22
aVhe'd been caught plagiarizing and faking quotes,
p23
aVand he was drenched in shame and regret, he told me.
p24
aVAnd he had the opportunity
p25
aVto publicly apologize at a foundation lunch.
p26
aVThis was going to be the most important speech of his life.
p27
aVMaybe it would win him some salvation.
p28
aVHe knew before he arrived
p29
aVthat the foundation was going to be live-streaming his event,
p30
aVbut what he didn't know until he turned up,
p31
aVwas that they'd erected a giant screen Twitter feed right next to his head.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVAnother one in a monitor screen in his eye line.
p34
aa(lp35
VI don't think the foundation did this because they were monstrous.
p36
aVI think they were clueless: I think this was a unique moment
p37
aVwhen the beautiful naivety of Twitter
p38
aVwas hitting the increasingly horrific reality.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd here were some of the Tweets that were cascading into his eye line,
p41
aVas he was trying to apologize:
p42
aa(lp43
V"Jonah Lehrer, boring us into forgiving him."
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd, "Jonah Lehrer has not proven that he is capable of feeling shame."
p47
aa(lp48
VThat one must have been written by the best psychiatrist ever,
p49
aVto know that about such a tiny figure behind a lectern.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd, "Jonah Lehrer is just a frigging sociopath."
p52
aa(lp53
VThat last word is a very human thing to do, to dehumanize the people we hurt.
p54
aVIt's because we want to destroy people but not feel bad about it.
p55
aVImagine if this was an actual court,
p56
aVand the accused was in the dark, begging for another chance,
p57
aVand the jury was yelling out,
p58
aV"Bored! Sociopath!"
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VYou know, when we watch courtroom dramas, we tend to identify
p62
aVwith the kindhearted defense attorney,
p63
aVbut give us the power, and we become like hanging judges.
p64
aa(lp65
VPower shifts fast.
p66
aVWe were getting Jonah because he was perceived to have misused his privilege,
p67
aVbut Jonah was on the floor then, and we were still kicking,
p68
aVand congratulating ourselves for punching up.
p69
aVAnd it began to feel weird and empty when there wasn't a powerful person
p70
aVwho had misused their privilege that we could get.
p71
aVA day without a shaming began to feel like a day
p72
aVpicking fingernails and treading water.
p73
aa(lp74
VLet me tell you a story.
p75
aVIt's about a woman called Justine Sacco.
p76
aVShe was a PR woman from New York with 170 Twitter followers,
p77
aVand she'd Tweet little acerbic jokes to them,
p78
aVlike this one on a plane from New York to London:
p79
aV[Weird German Dude: You're in first class. It's 2014. Get some deodorant."
p80
aV-Inner monologue as inhale BO. Thank god for pharmaceuticals.]
p81
aVSo Justine chuckled to herself, and pressed send, and got no replies,
p82
aVand felt that sad feeling that we all feel
p83
aVwhen the Internet doesn't congratulate us for being funny.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVBlack silence when the Internet doesn't talk back.
p86
aVAnd then she got to Heathrow, and she had a little time to spare
p87
aVbefore her final leg, so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke:
p88
aa(lp89
V[Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!]
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd she chuckled to herself, pressed send, got on the plane, got no replies,
p92
aVturned off her phone, fell asleep,
p93
aVwoke up 11 hours later,
p94
aVturned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway,
p95
aVand straightaway there was a message from somebody
p96
aVthat she hadn't spoken to since high school,
p97
aVthat said, "I am so sorry to see what's happening to you."
p98
aVAnd then another message from a best friend,
p99
aV"You need to call me right now.
p100
aVYou are the worldwide number one trending topic on Twitter."
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VWhat had happened is that one of her 170 followers had sent the Tweet
p104
aVto a Gawker journalist, and he retweeted it to his 15,000 followers:
p105
aV[And now, a funny holiday joke from IAC's PR boss]
p106
aVAnd then it was like a bolt of lightning.
p107
aVA few weeks later, I talked to the Gawker journalist.
p108
aVI emailed him and asked him how it felt, and he said, "It felt delicious."
p109
aVAnd then he said, "But I'm sure she's fine."
p110
aa(lp111
VBut she wasn't fine, because while she slept,
p112
aVTwitter took control of her life and dismantled it piece by piece.
p113
aVFirst there were the philanthropists:
p114
aV[If @JustineSacco's unfortunate words ... bother you,
p115
aVjoin me in supporting @CARE's work in Africa.]
p116
aV[In light of ... disgusting, racist tweet, I'm donating to @care today]
p117
aVThen came the beyond horrified:
p118
aV[... no words for that horribly disgusting racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco.
p119
aVI am beyond horrified.]
p120
aa(lp121
VWas anybody on Twitter that night? A few of you.
p122
aVDid Justine's joke overwhelm your Twitter feed the way it did mine?
p123
aVIt did mine, and I thought what everybody thought that night,
p124
aVwhich was, "Wow, somebody's screwed!
p125
aVSomebody's life is about to get terrible!"
p126
aVAnd I sat up in my bed,
p127
aVand I put the pillow behind my head,
p128
aVand then I thought, I'm not entirely sure that joke was intended to be racist.
p129
aVMaybe instead of gleefully flaunting her privilege,
p130
aVshe was mocking the gleeful flaunting of privilege.
p131
aVThere's a comedy tradition of this,
p132
aVlike South Park or Colbert or Randy Newman.
p133
aVMaybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being as good at it as Randy Newman.
p134
aVIn fact, when I met Justine a couple of weeks later in a bar,
p135
aVshe was just crushed,
p136
aVand I asked her to explain the joke,
p137
aVand she said, "Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble
p138
aVwhen it comes to what is going on in the Third World.
p139
aVI was making of fun of that bubble."
p140
aa(lp141
VYou know, another woman on Twitter that night, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis,
p142
aVshe reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she Tweeted that night,
p143
aV"I'm not sure that her joke was intended to be racist,"
p144
aVand she said straightaway she got a fury of Tweets saying,
p145
aV"Well, you're just a privileged bitch, too."
p146
aVAnd so to her shame, she wrote,
p147
aVshe shut up and watched as Justine's life got torn apart.
p148
aa(lp149
VIt started to get darker:
p150
aV[Everyone go report this cunt @JustineSacco]
p151
aVThen came the calls for her to be fired.
p152
aV[Good luck with the job hunt in the new year. #GettingFired]
p153
aVThousands of people around the world
p154
aVdecided it was their duty to get her fired.
p155
aV[@JustineSacco last tweet of your career. #SorryNotSorry
p156
aVCorporations got involved, hoping to sell their products
p157
aVon the back of Justine's annihilation:
p158
aV[Next time you plan to tweet something stupid before you take off,
p159
aVmake sure you are getting on a @Gogo flight!]
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VA lot of companies were making good money that night.
p163
aVYou know, Justine's name was normally Googled 40 times a month.
p164
aVThat month, between December the 20th and the end of December,
p165
aVher name was Googled 1,220,000 times.
p166
aVAnd one Internet economist told me that that meant that Google made
p167
aVsomewhere between 120,000 dollars and 468,000 dollars
p168
aVfrom Justine's annihilation, whereas those of us doing the actual shaming \u2014
p169
aVwe got nothing.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVWe were like unpaid shaming interns for Google.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd then came the trolls:
p175
aV[I'm actually kind of hoping Justine Sacco gets aids? lol]
p176
aVSomebody else on that wrote,
p177
aV"Somebody HIV-positive should rape this bitch and then we'll find out
p178
aVif her skin color protects her from AIDS."
p179
aVAnd that person got a free pass.
p180
aVNobody went after that person.
p181
aVWe were all so excited about destroying Justine,
p182
aVand our shaming brains are so simple-minded,
p183
aVthat we couldn't also handle destroying somebody
p184
aVwho was inappropriately destroying Justine.
p185
aVJustine was really uniting a lot of disparate groups that night,
p186
aVfrom philanthropists to "rape the bitch."
p187
aV[@JustineSacco I hope you get fired! You demented bitch...
p188
aVJust let the world know you're planning to ride bare back while in Africa.]
p189
aa(lp190
VWomen always have it worse than men.
p191
aVWhen a man gets shamed, it's, "I'm going to get you fired."
p192
aVWhen a woman gets shamed, it's,
p193
aV"I'm going to get you fired and raped and cut out your uterus."
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd then Justine's employers got involved:
p196
aV[IAC on @JustineSacco tweet: This is an outrageous, offensive comment.
p197
aVEmployee in question currently unreachable on an intl flight.]
p198
aVAnd that's when the anger turned to excitement:
p199
aV[All I want for Christmas is to see @JustineSacco's face when her plane lands
p200
aVand she checks her inbox/voicemail. #fired]
p201
aV[Oh man, @justinesacco is going to have the most painful
p202
aVphone-turning-on moment ever when her plane lands.]
p203
aV[We are about to watch this @JustineSacco bitch get fired. In REAL time.
p204
aVBefore she even KNOWS she's getting fired.]
p205
aVWhat we had was a delightful narrative arc.
p206
aVWe knew something that Justine didn't.
p207
aVCan you think of anything less judicial than this?
p208
aVJustine was asleep on a plane and unable to explain herself,
p209
aVand her inability was a huge part of the hilarity.
p210
aVOn Twitter that night, we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun.
p211
aVSomebody worked out exactly which plane she was on, so they linked
p212
aVto a flight tracker website.
p213
aV[British Airways Flight 43 On-time - arrives in 1 hour 34 minutes]
p214
aVA hashtag began trending worldwide:
p215
aV# hasJustineLandedYet?
p216
aV[It is kinda wild to see someone self-destruct
p217
aVwithout them even being aware of it. #hasJustineLandedYet]
p218
aV[Seriously. I just want to go home to go to bed, but everyone at the bar
p219
aVis SO into #HasJustineLandedYet. Can't look away. Can't leave.]
p220
aV[#HasJustineLandedYet may be the best thing to happen to my Friday night.]
p221
aV[Is no one in Cape Town going to the airport to tweet her arrival?
p222
aVCome on, twitter! I'd like pictures]
p223
aVAnd guess what? Yes there was.
p224
aV[@JustineSacco HAS in fact landed at Cape Town international.
p225
aVAnd if you want to know what it looks like to discover
p226
aVthat you've just been torn to shreds because of a misconstrued liberal joke,
p227
aVnot by trolls, but by nice people like us,
p228
aVthis is what it looks like:
p229
aV[... She's decided to wear sunnies as a disguise.]
p230
aa(lp231
VSo why did we do it?
p232
aVI think some people were genuinely upset,
p233
aVbut I think for other people,
p234
aVit's because Twitter is basically a mutual approval machine.
p235
aVWe surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do,
p236
aVand we approve each other,
p237
aVand that's a really good feeling.
p238
aVAnd if somebody gets in the way, we screen them out.
p239
aVAnd do you know what that's the opposite of?
p240
aVIt's the opposite of democracy.
p241
aVWe wanted to show that we cared about people dying of AIDS in Africa.
p242
aVOur desire to be seen to be compassionate is what led us to commit
p243
aVthis profoundly un-compassionate act.
p244
aVAs Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote in the Boston Review,
p245
aV"This isn't social justice. It's a cathartic alternative."
p246
aa(lp247
VFor the past three years,
p248
aVI've been going around the world meeting people like Justine Sacco \u2014
p249
aVand believe me, there's a lot of people like Justine Sacco.
p250
aVThere's more every day.
p251
aVAnd we want to think they're fine, but they're not fine.
p252
aVThe people I met were mangled.
p253
aVThey talked to me about depression,
p254
aVand anxiety and insomnia and suicidal thoughts.
p255
aVOne woman I talked to, who also told a joke that landed badly,
p256
aVshe stayed home for a year and a half.
p257
aVBefore that, she worked with adults with learning difficulties,
p258
aVand was apparently really good at her job.
p259
aa(lp260
VJustine was fired, of course, because social media demanded it.
p261
aVBut it was worse than that.
p262
aVShe was losing herself.
p263
aVShe was waking up in the middle of the night, forgetting who she was.
p264
aVShe was got because she was perceived to have misused her privilege.
p265
aVAnd of course, that's a much better thing to get people for than the things
p266
aVwe used to get people for, like having children out of wedlock.
p267
aVBut the phrase "misuse of privilege" is becoming a free pass
p268
aVto tear apart pretty much anybody we choose to.
p269
aVIt's becoming a devalued term,
p270
aVand it's making us lose our capacity for empathy
p271
aVand for distinguishing between serious and unserious transgressions.
p272
aa(lp273
VJustine had 170 Twitter followers, and so to make it work,
p274
aVshe had to be fictionalized.
p275
aVWord got around that she was the daughter the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.
p276
aV[Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacco her father is a SA mining billionaire.
p277
aVShe's not sorry. And neither is her father.]
p278
aVI thought that was true about Justine,
p279
aVuntil I met her at a bar, and I asked her about her billionaire father,
p280
aVand she said, "My father sells carpets."
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd I think back on the early days of Twitter,
p283
aVwhen people would admit shameful secrets about themselves,
p284
aVand other people would say, "Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."
p285
aVThese days, the hunt is on for people's shameful secrets.
p286
aVYou can lead a good, ethical life,
p287
aVbut some bad phraseology in a Tweet can overwhelm it all,
p288
aVbecome a clue to your secret inner evil.
p289
aa(lp290
VMaybe there's two types of people in the world:
p291
aVthose people who favor humans over ideology,
p292
aVand those people who favor ideology over humans.
p293
aVI favor humans over ideology,
p294
aVbut right now, the ideologues are winning,
p295
aVand they're creating a stage for constant artificial high dramas
p296
aVwhere everybody's either a magnificent hero
p297
aVor a sickening villain,
p298
aVeven though we know that's not true about our fellow humans.
p299
aVWhat's true is that we are clever and stupid;
p300
aVwhat's true is that we're grey areas.
p301
aVThe great thing about social media was how it gave a voice
p302
aVto voiceless people,
p303
aVbut we're now creating a surveillance society,
p304
aVwhere the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless.
p305
aa(lp306
VLet's not do that.
p307
aa(lp308
VThank you.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Applause)
p311
aa(lp312
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Jon.
p313
aa(lp314
VJon Ronson: Thanks, Bruno.
p315
aa(lp316
VBG: Don't go away.
p317
aVWhat strikes me about Justine's story
p318
aVis also the fact that if you Google her name today,
p319
aVthis story covers the first 100 pages of Google results \u2014
p320
aVthere is nothing else about her.
p321
aVIn your book, you mention another story
p322
aVof another victim who actually got taken on by a reputation management firm,
p323
aVand by creating blogs and posting nice, innocuous stories about her love for cats
p324
aVand holidays and stuff, managed to get the story
p325
aVoff the first couple pages of Google results, but it didn't last long.
p326
aVA couple of weeks later, they started creeping back up to the top result.
p327
aVIs this a totally lost battle?
p328
aa(lp329
VJon Ronson: You know, I think the very best thing we can do,
p330
aVif you see a kind of unfair or an ambiguous shaming,
p331
aVis to speak up, because I think the worst thing that happened to Justine
p332
aVwas that nobody supported her \u2014 like, everyone was against her,
p333
aVand that is profoundly traumatizing,
p334
aVto be told by tens of thousands of people that you need to get out.
p335
aVBut if a shaming happens and there's a babble of voices, like in a democracy,
p336
aVwhere people are discussing it, I think that's much less damaging.
p337
aVSo I think that's the way forward,
p338
aVbut it's hard, because if you do stand up for somebody,
p339
aVit's incredibly unpleasant.
p340
aa(lp341
VBG: So let's talk about your experience,
p342
aVbecause you stood up by writing this book.
p343
aVBy the way, it's mandatory reading for everybody, okay?
p344
aVYou stood up because the book actually puts the spotlight on shamers.
p345
aVAnd I assume you didn't only have friendly reactions on Twitter.
p346
aa(lp347
VJR: It didn't go down that well with some people.
p348
aV(Laughter)
p349
aVI mean, you don't want to just concentrate \u2014
p350
aVbecause lots of people understood, and were really nice about the book.
p351
aVBut yeah, for 30 years I've been writing stories about abuses of power,
p352
aVand when I say the powerful people over there in the military,
p353
aVor in the pharmaceutical industry, everybody applauds me.
p354
aVAs soon as I say, "We are the powerful people abusing our power now,"
p355
aVI get people saying, "Well you must be a racist too."
p356
aa(lp357
VBG: So the other night \u2014 yesterday \u2014 we were at dinner,
p358
aVand there were two discussions going on.
p359
aVOn one side you were talking with people around the table \u2014
p360
aVand that was a nice, constructive discussion.
p361
aVOn the other, every time you turned to your phone,
p362
aVthere is this deluge of insults.
p363
aa(lp364
VJR: Yeah. This happened last night. We had like a TED dinner last night.
p365
aVWe were chatting and it was lovely and nice, and I decided to check Twitter.
p366
aVSomebody said, "You are a white supremacist."
p367
aVAnd then I went back and had a nice conversation with somebody,
p368
aVand then I went back to Twitter,
p369
aVsomebody said my very existence made the world a worse place.
p370
aVMy friend Adam Curtis says
p371
aVthat maybe the Internet is like a John Carpenter movie from the 1980s,
p372
aVwhen eventually everyone will start screaming at each other
p373
aVand shooting each other, and then eventually everybody
p374
aVwould flee to somewhere safer,
p375
aVand I'm starting to think of that as a really nice option.
p376
aa(lp377
VBG: Jon, thank you. JR: Thank you, Bruno.

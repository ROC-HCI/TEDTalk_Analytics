VI grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.
p5
aVIn high school, I took a bus to school
p6
aVan hour each way every day.
p7
aVAnd I was always absorbed in a book,
p8
aVscience fiction book,
p9
aVwhich took my mind to other worlds,
p10
aVand satisfied, in a narrative form,
p11
aVthis insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd you know, that curiosity also manifested itself
p14
aVin the fact that whenever I wasn't in school
p15
aVI was out in the woods,
p16
aVhiking and taking "samples" \u2014
p17
aVfrogs and snakes and bugs and pond water \u2014
p18
aVand bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.
p19
aVYou know, I was a real science geek.
p20
aVBut it was all about trying to understand the world,
p21
aVunderstand the limits of possibility.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd my love of science fiction
p24
aVactually seemed mirrored in the world around me,
p25
aVbecause what was happening, this was in the late '60s,
p26
aVwe were going to the moon,
p27
aVwe were exploring the deep oceans.
p28
aVJacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms
p29
aVwith his amazing specials that showed us
p30
aVanimals and places and a wondrous world
p31
aVthat we could never really have previously imagined.
p32
aVSo, that seemed to resonate
p33
aVwith the whole science fiction part of it.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd I was an artist.
p36
aVI could draw. I could paint.
p37
aVAnd I found that because there weren't video games
p38
aVand this saturation of CG movies and all of this
p39
aVimagery in the media landscape,
p40
aVI had to create these images in my head.
p41
aVYou know, we all did, as kids having to
p42
aVread a book, and through the author's description,
p43
aVput something on the movie screen in our heads.
p44
aVAnd so, my response to this was to paint, to draw
p45
aValien creatures, alien worlds,
p46
aVrobots, spaceships, all that stuff.
p47
aVI was endlessly getting busted in math class
p48
aVdoodling behind the textbook.
p49
aVThat was \u2014 the creativity
p50
aVhad to find its outlet somehow.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows
p53
aVactually got me very excited about the fact that there was
p54
aVan alien world right here on Earth.
p55
aVI might not really go to an alien world
p56
aVon a spaceship someday \u2014
p57
aVthat seemed pretty darn unlikely.
p58
aVBut that was a world I could really go to,
p59
aVright here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic
p60
aVas anything that I had imagined
p61
aVfrom reading these books.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver
p64
aVat the age of 15.
p65
aVAnd the only problem with that was that I lived
p66
aVin a little village in Canada,
p67
aV600 miles from the nearest ocean.
p68
aVBut I didn't let that daunt me.
p69
aVI pestered my father until he finally found
p70
aVa scuba class in Buffalo, New York,
p71
aVright across the border from where we live.
p72
aVAnd I actually got certified
p73
aVin a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter
p74
aVin Buffalo, New York.
p75
aVAnd I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,
p76
aVfor another two years,
p77
aVuntil we moved to California.
p78
aa(lp79
VSince then, in the intervening
p80
aV40 years,
p81
aVI've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,
p82
aVand 500 hours of that was in submersibles.
p83
aVAnd I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,
p84
aVand even the shallow oceans,
p85
aVare so rich with amazing life
p86
aVthat really is beyond our imagination.
p87
aVNature's imagination is so boundless
p88
aVcompared to our own
p89
aVmeager human imagination.
p90
aVI still, to this day, stand in absolute awe
p91
aVof what I see when I make these dives.
p92
aVAnd my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,
p93
aVand just as strong as it ever was.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut when I chose a career as an adult,
p96
aVit was filmmaking.
p97
aVAnd that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
p98
aVthis urge I had to tell stories
p99
aVwith my urges to create images.
p100
aVAnd I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.
p101
aVSo, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories
p102
aVtogether, and that made sense.
p103
aVAnd of course the stories that I chose to tell
p104
aVwere science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens"
p105
aVand "The Abyss."
p106
aVAnd with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love
p107
aVof underwater and diving with filmmaking.
p108
aVSo, you know, merging the two passions.
p109
aa(lp110
VSomething interesting came out of "The Abyss,"
p111
aVwhich was that to solve a specific narrative
p112
aVproblem on that film,
p113
aVwhich was to create this kind of liquid water creature,
p114
aVwe actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.
p115
aVAnd this resulted in the first soft-surface
p116
aVcharacter, CG animation
p117
aVthat was ever in a movie.
p118
aVAnd even though the film didn't make any money \u2014
p119
aVbarely broke even, I should say \u2014
p120
aVI witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,
p121
aVthe global audience, was mesmerized
p122
aVby this apparent magic.
p123
aa(lp124
VYou know, it's Arthur Clarke's law
p125
aVthat any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
p126
aVThey were seeing something magical.
p127
aVAnd so that got me very excited.
p128
aVAnd I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced
p129
aVinto the cinematic art."
p130
aVSo, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film,
p131
aVwe took that much farther.
p132
aVWorking with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude
p133
aVin that film. The success hung in the balance
p134
aVon whether that effect would work.
p135
aVAnd it did, and we created magic again,
p136
aVand we had the same result with an audience \u2014
p137
aValthough we did make a little more money on that one.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo, drawing a line through those two dots
p140
aVof experience
p141
aVcame to, "This is going to be a whole new world,"
p142
aVthis was a whole new world of creativity
p143
aVfor film artists.
p144
aVSo, I started a company with Stan Winston,
p145
aVmy good friend Stan Winston,
p146
aVwho is the premier make-up and creature designer
p147
aVat that time, and it was called Digital Domain.
p148
aVAnd the concept of the company was
p149
aVthat we would leapfrog past
p150
aVthe analog processes of optical printers and so on,
p151
aVand we would go right to digital production.
p152
aVAnd we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s
p155
aVin the creature and character design stuff
p156
aVthat we had actually founded the company to do.
p157
aVSo, I wrote this piece called "Avatar,"
p158
aVwhich was meant to absolutely push the envelope
p159
aVof visual effects,
p160
aVof CG effects, beyond,
p161
aVwith realistic human emotive characters
p162
aVgenerated in CG,
p163
aVand the main characters would all be in CG,
p164
aVand the world would be in CG.
p165
aVAnd the envelope pushed back,
p166
aVand I was told by the folks at my company
p167
aVthat we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVYou know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:
p172
aV"It's going to be this epic romance,
p173
aVpassionate film."
p174
aVSecretly, what I wanted to do was
p175
aVI wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic."
p176
aVAnd that's why I made the movie.
p177
aV(Applause)
p178
aVAnd that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.
p179
aVBut I convinced them. I said,
p180
aV"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.
p181
aVWe'll be using it in the opening of the film.
p182
aVIt will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook."
p183
aVAnd I talked them into funding an expedition.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VSounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme
p187
aVabout your imagination creating a reality.
p188
aVBecause we actually created a reality where six months later,
p189
aVI find myself in a Russian submersible
p190
aVtwo and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,
p191
aVlooking at the real Titanic through a view port.
p192
aVNot a movie, not HD \u2014 for real.
p193
aV(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, that blew my mind.
p196
aVAnd it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras
p197
aVand lights and all kinds of things.
p198
aVBut, it struck me how much
p199
aVthis dive, these deep dives,
p200
aVwas like a space mission.
p201
aVYou know, where it was highly technical,
p202
aVand it required enormous planning.
p203
aVYou get in this capsule, you go down to this dark
p204
aVhostile environment
p205
aVwhere there is no hope of rescue
p206
aVif you can't get back by yourself.
p207
aVAnd I thought like, "Wow. I'm like,
p208
aVliving in a science fiction movie.
p209
aVThis is really cool."
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.
p212
aVOf course, the curiosity, the science component of it \u2014
p213
aVit was everything. It was adventure,
p214
aVit was curiosity, it was imagination.
p215
aVAnd it was an experience that
p216
aVHollywood couldn't give me.
p217
aVBecause, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could
p218
aVcreate a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing
p219
aVout that window.
p220
aVAs we did some of our subsequent expeditions,
p221
aVI was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents
p222
aVand sometimes things that I had never seen before,
p223
aVsometimes things that no one had seen before,
p224
aVthat actually were not described by science
p225
aVat the time that we saw them and imaged them.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo, I was completely smitten by this,
p228
aVand had to do more.
p229
aVAnd so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.
p230
aVAfter the success of "Titanic,"
p231
aVI said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job
p232
aVas a Hollywood movie maker,
p233
aVand I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while."
p234
aVAnd so, we started planning these
p235
aVexpeditions.
p236
aVAnd we wound up going to the Bismark,
p237
aVand exploring it with robotic vehicles.
p238
aVWe went back to the Titanic wreck.
p239
aVWe took little bots that we had created
p240
aVthat spooled a fiber optic.
p241
aVAnd the idea was to go in and do an interior
p242
aVsurvey of that ship, which had never been done.
p243
aVNobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,
p244
aVso we created technology to do it.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo, you know, here I am now, on the deck
p247
aVof Titanic, sitting in a submersible,
p248
aVand looking out at planks that look much like this,
p249
aVwhere I knew that the band had played.
p250
aVAnd I'm flying a little robotic vehicle
p251
aVthrough the corridor of the ship.
p252
aVWhen I say, "I'm operating it,"
p253
aVbut my mind is in the vehicle.
p254
aVI felt like I was physically present
p255
aVinside the shipwreck of Titanic.
p256
aVAnd it was the most surreal kind
p257
aVof deja vu experience I've ever had,
p258
aVbecause I would know before I turned a corner
p259
aVwhat was going to be there before the lights
p260
aVof the vehicle actually revealed it,
p261
aVbecause I had walked the set for months
p262
aVwhen we were making the movie.
p263
aVAnd the set was based as an exact replica
p264
aVon the blueprints of the ship.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.
p267
aVAnd it really made me realize that
p268
aVthe telepresence experience \u2014
p269
aVthat you actually can have these robotic avatars,
p270
aVthen your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,
p271
aVinto this other form of existence.
p272
aVIt was really, really quite profound.
p273
aVAnd it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening
p274
aVsome decades out
p275
aVas we start to have cyborg bodies
p276
aVfor exploration or for other means
p277
aVin many sort of
p278
aVpost-human futures
p279
aVthat I can imagine,
p280
aVas a science fiction fan.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo, having done these expeditions,
p283
aVand really beginning to appreciate what was down there,
p284
aVsuch as at the deep ocean vents
p285
aVwhere we had these amazing, amazing animals \u2014
p286
aVthey're basically aliens right here on Earth.
p287
aVThey live in an environment of chemosynthesis.
p288
aVThey don't survive on sunlight-based
p289
aVsystem the way we do.
p290
aVAnd so, you're seeing animals that are living next to
p291
aVa 500-degree-Centigrade
p292
aVwater plumes.
p293
aVYou think they can't possibly exist.
p294
aa(lp295
VAt the same time
p296
aVI was getting very interested in space science as well \u2014
p297
aVagain, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.
p298
aVAnd I wound up getting involved with
p299
aVthe space community,
p300
aVreally involved with NASA,
p301
aVsitting on the NASA advisory board,
p302
aVplanning actual space missions,
p303
aVgoing to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut
p304
aVbiomedical protocols,
p305
aVand all these sorts of things,
p306
aVto actually go and fly to the international space station
p307
aVwith our 3D camera systems.
p308
aVAnd this was fascinating.
p309
aVBut what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists
p310
aVwith us into the deep.
p311
aVAnd taking them down so that they had access \u2014
p312
aVastrobiologists, planetary scientists,
p313
aVpeople who were interested in these extreme environments \u2014
p314
aVtaking them down to the vents, and letting them see,
p315
aVand take samples and test instruments, and so on.
p316
aa(lp317
VSo, here we were making documentary films,
p318
aVbut actually doing science,
p319
aVand actually doing space science.
p320
aVI'd completely closed the loop
p321
aVbetween being the science fiction fan,
p322
aVyou know, as a kid,
p323
aVand doing this stuff for real.
p324
aVAnd you know, along the way in this journey
p325
aVof discovery,
p326
aVI learned a lot.
p327
aVI learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot
p328
aVabout leadership.
p329
aVNow you think director has got to be a leader,
p330
aVleader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.
p331
aa(lp332
VI didn't really learn about leadership
p333
aVuntil I did these expeditions.
p334
aVBecause I had to, at a certain point, say,
p335
aV"What am I doing out here?
p336
aVWhy am I doing this? What do I get out of it?"
p337
aVWe don't make money at these damn shows.
p338
aVWe barely break even. There is no fame in it.
p339
aVPeople sort of think I went away
p340
aVbetween "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails
p341
aVsomeplace, sitting at the beach.
p342
aVMade all these films, made all these documentary films
p343
aVfor a very limited audience.
p344
aa(lp345
VNo fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing?
p346
aVYou're doing it for the task itself,
p347
aVfor the challenge \u2014
p348
aVand the ocean is the most challenging environment there is \u2014
p349
aVfor the thrill of discovery,
p350
aVand for that strange bond that happens
p351
aVwhen a small group of people form a tightly knit team.
p352
aVBecause we would do these things with 10, 12 people,
p353
aVworking for years at a time,
p354
aVsometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd in that bond, you realize
p357
aVthat the most important thing
p358
aVis the respect that you have for them
p359
aVand that they have for you, that you've done a task
p360
aVthat you can't explain to someone else.
p361
aVWhen you come back to the shore and you say,
p362
aV"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,
p363
aVand the this and the that,
p364
aVall the technology of it, and the difficulty,
p365
aVthe human-performance aspects of working at sea,"
p366
aVyou can't explain it to people. It's that thing that
p367
aVmaybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together
p368
aVand they know they can never explain it.
p369
aVCreates a bond, creates a bond of respect.
p370
aa(lp371
VSo, when I came back to make my next movie,
p372
aVwhich was "Avatar,"
p373
aVI tried to apply that same principle of leadership,
p374
aVwhich is that you respect your team,
p375
aVand you earn their respect in return.
p376
aVAnd it really changed the dynamic.
p377
aVSo, here I was again with a small team,
p378
aVin uncharted territory,
p379
aVdoing "Avatar," coming up with new technology
p380
aVthat didn't exist before.
p381
aVTremendously exciting.
p382
aVTremendously challenging.
p383
aVAnd we became a family, over a four-and-half year period.
p384
aVAnd it completely changed how I do movies.
p385
aVSo, people have commented on how, "Well, you know,
p386
aVyou brought back the ocean organisms
p387
aVand put them on the planet of Pandora."
p388
aVTo me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,
p389
aVthe process itself, that changed as a result of that.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo, what can we synthesize out of all this?
p392
aVYou know, what are the lessons learned?
p393
aVWell, I think number one is
p394
aVcuriosity.
p395
aVIt's the most powerful thing you own.
p396
aVImagination is a force
p397
aVthat can actually manifest a reality.
p398
aVAnd the respect of your team
p399
aVis more important than all the
p400
aVlaurels in the world.
p401
aVI have young filmmakers
p402
aVcome up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this."
p403
aVAnd I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.
p404
aVOther people will do that for you \u2014 don't do it to yourself,
p405
aVdon't bet against yourself,
p406
aVand take risks."
p407
aa(lp408
VNASA has this phrase that they like:
p409
aV"Failure is not an option."
p410
aVBut failure has to be an option
p411
aVin art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.
p412
aVAnd no important endeavor
p413
aVthat required innovation
p414
aVwas done without risk.
p415
aVYou have to be willing to take those risks.
p416
aVSo, that's the thought I would leave you with,
p417
aVis that in whatever you're doing,
p418
aVfailure is an option,
p419
aVbut fear is not. Thank you.

VToday 40 million Americans are indebted for their passage to the new economy.
p5
aVToo poor to pay their way through college,
p6
aVthey now owe lenders more than one trillion US dollars.
p7
aVThey do find what jobs they can get
p8
aVto pay off a debt that is secured on their person.
p9
aVIn America,
p10
aVeven a bankrupt gambler gets a second chance.
p11
aVBut it is nearly impossible
p12
aVfor an American to get discharged their student loan debts.
p13
aa(lp14
VOnce upon a time in America,
p15
aVgoing to college did not mean graduating with debt.
p16
aVMy friend Paul's father graduated from Colorado State University
p17
aVon the GI Bill.
p18
aVFor his generation,
p19
aVhigher education was free or almost free,
p20
aVbecause it was thought of as a public good.
p21
aVNot anymore.
p22
aVWhen Paul also graduated from Colorado State University,
p23
aVhe paid for his English degree by working part-time.
p24
aV30 years ago,
p25
aVhigher education tuition was affordable, reasonable,
p26
aVand what debts you accumulated, you paid off by graduation date.
p27
aVNot anymore.
p28
aVPaul's daughter followed in his footsteps,
p29
aVbut with one difference:
p30
aVwhen she graduated five years ago,
p31
aVit was with a whopping debt.
p32
aa(lp33
VStudents like Kate have to take on a loan
p34
aVbecause the cost of higher education has become unaffordable
p35
aVfor many if not most American families.
p36
aVBut so what?
p37
aVGetting into debt to buy an expensive education
p38
aVis not all bad if you could pay it off
p39
aVwith the increased income that you earned from it.
p40
aVBut that's where the rubber meets the road.
p41
aVEven a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001
p42
aVthan she did in 2013.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo ...
p45
aVtuition costs up,
p46
aVpublic funding down,
p47
aVfamily incomes diminished,
p48
aVpersonal incomes weak.
p49
aVIs it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must
p50
aVcannot make their student loan payments?
p51
aVThe worst of times can be the best of times,
p52
aVbecause certain truths flash up in ways that you can't ignore.
p53
aVI want to speak of three of them today.
p54
aa(lp55
V1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas
p56
aVmake it abundantly obvious
p57
aVthat higher education is a consumer product you can buy.
p58
aVAll of us talk about education just as the economists do now,
p59
aVas an investment that you make to improve the human stock
p60
aVby training them for work.
p61
aVAs an investment you make to sort and classify people
p62
aVso that employers can hire them more easily.
p63
aVThe U.S. News & World Report ranks colleges
p64
aVjust as the consumer report rates washing machines.
p65
aVThe language is peppered with barbarisms.
p66
aVTeachers are called "service providers,"
p67
aVstudents are called "consumers."
p68
aVSociology and Shakespeare and soccer and science,
p69
aVall of these are "content."
p70
aa(lp71
VStudent debt is profitable.
p72
aVOnly not on you.
p73
aVYour debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry.
p74
aVThe two 800-pound gorillas of which \u2014
p75
aVSallie Mae and Navient \u2014
p76
aVposted last year a combined profit of 1.2 billion dollars.
p77
aVAnd just like home mortgages,
p78
aVstudent loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and diced,
p79
aVand sold on Wall Street.
p80
aVAnd colleges and universities
p81
aVthat invest in these securitized loans
p82
aVprofit twice.
p83
aVOnce from your tuition,
p84
aVand then again from the interest on debt.
p85
aa(lp86
VWith all that money to be made,
p87
aVare we surprised that some in the higher education business
p88
aVhave begun to engage in false advertising,
p89
aVin bait and switch ...
p90
aVin exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate?
p91
aa(lp92
VThird:
p93
aVdiplomas are a brand.
p94
aVMany years ago my teacher wrote,
p95
aV"When students are treated as consumers,
p96
aVthey're made prisoners of addiction and envy."
p97
aVJust as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iPhone,
p98
aVso also people can be sold more and more education.
p99
aVCollege is the new high school,
p100
aVwe already say that.
p101
aVBut why stop there?
p102
aVPeople can be upsold on certifications and recertifications,
p103
aVmaster's degrees, doctoral degrees.
p104
aa(lp105
VHigher education is also marketed as a status object.
p106
aVBuy a degree,
p107
aVmuch like you do a Lexus of a Louis Vuitton bag,
p108
aVto distinguish yourself from others.
p109
aVSo you can be the object of envy of others.
p110
aVDiplomas are a brand.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut these truths are often times hidden by a very noisy sales pitch.
p113
aVThere is not a day that goes by
p114
aVwithout some policy guy on television telling us,
p115
aV"A college degree is absolutely essential
p116
aVto get on that up escalator to a middle-class life."
p117
aVAnd the usual evidence offered is the college premium:
p118
aVa college grad who makes on average 56 percent more than a high school grad.
p119
aa(lp120
VLet's look at that number more carefully,
p121
aVbecause on the face of it,
p122
aVit seems to belie the stories we all hear
p123
aVabout college grads working as baristas and cashiers.
p124
aVOf 100 people who enroll in any form of post-secondary education,
p125
aV45 do not complete it in a timely fashion,
p126
aVfor a number of reasons, including financial.
p127
aVOf the 55 that do graduate,
p128
aVtwo will remain unemployed,
p129
aVand another 18 are underemployed.
p130
aVSo, college grads earn more than high school grads,
p131
aVbut does it pay for the exorbitant tuition
p132
aVand the lost wages while at college?
p133
aa(lp134
VNow even economists admit
p135
aVgoing to college pays off for only those who complete it.
p136
aVBut that's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone,
p137
aVfor decades now.
p138
aVFor decades,
p139
aVworkers with a high school degree
p140
aVhave been denied a fair share of what they have produced.
p141
aVAnd had they received as they should have,
p142
aVthen going to college would have been a bad investment for many.
p143
aVCollege premium?
p144
aVI think it's a high school discount.
p145
aa(lp146
VTwo out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job.
p147
aVAnd the future, for them, doesn't look particularly promising \u2014
p148
aVin fact, it's downright bleak.
p149
aVAnd it is they who are going to suffer
p150
aVthe most punishing forms of student debt.
p151
aVAnd it is they,
p152
aVcuriously and sadly,
p153
aVwho are marketed most loudly about this college premium thing.
p154
aVThat's not just cynical marketing,
p155
aVthat's cruel.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo what do we do?
p158
aVWhat if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer product?
p159
aVEverybody else seems to.
p160
aVThen, like any other consumer product,
p161
aVyou would demand to know what you're paying for.
p162
aVWhen you buy medicines,
p163
aVyou get a list of side effects.
p164
aVWhen you buy a higher educational product,
p165
aVyou should have a warning label
p166
aVthat allows consumers to choose,
p167
aVmake informed choices.
p168
aVWhen you buy a car,
p169
aVit tells you how many miles per gallon to expect.
p170
aVWho knows what to expect
p171
aVfrom a degree say, in Canadian Studies.
p172
aVThere is such a thing, by the way.
p173
aa(lp174
VWhat if there was an app for that?
p175
aVOne that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income.
p176
aVLet's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT.
p177
aVOne of you make this.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VDiscover your reality.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VThere are three advantages,
p186
aVthree benefits to Income-Based Tuition.
p187
aVAny user can figure out
p188
aVhow much money he or she will make from a given college and major.
p189
aVSuch informed users
p190
aVare unlikely to fall victim to the huckster's ploy,
p191
aVto the sales pitch.
p192
aVBut also to choose wisely.
p193
aVWhy would anybody pay more for college
p194
aVthan let's say, 15 percent of the additional income they earn?
p195
aa(lp196
VThere's a second benefit to Income-Based Tuition.
p197
aVBy tying the cost to the income,
p198
aVcollege administrators would be forced to manage costs better,
p199
aVto find innovative ways to do so.
p200
aVFor instance,
p201
aVall of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major.
p202
aVThat is manifestly unfair, and should change.
p203
aVAn engineering student uses more resources
p204
aVand facilities and labs and faculty
p205
aVthan a philosophy student.
p206
aVBut the philosophy student, as a consequence,
p207
aVis subsidizing the engineering student.
p208
aVWho then, by the way, goes on and earns more money.
p209
aVWhy should two people buy the same product,
p210
aVpay the same,
p211
aVbut one person receive half or a third of the service.
p212
aVIn fact, college grads, some majors,
p213
aVpay 25 percent of their income servicing their student debt,
p214
aVwhile others pay five percent.
p215
aVThat kind if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow of course, all this data \u2014
p218
aVand one of you is going to do this, right?
p219
aVAll this data has to be well designed,
p220
aVmaybe audited by public accounting firms
p221
aVto avoid statistical lies.
p222
aVWe know about statistics, right?
p223
aa(lp224
VBut be that as it may,
p225
aVthe third and biggest benefit of Income-Based Tuition,
p226
aVis it would free Americans from the fear and the fact of financial ruin
p227
aVbecause they bought a defective product.
p228
aa(lp229
VPerhaps, in time,
p230
aVyoung and old Americans may rediscover,
p231
aVas the gentleman said earlier,
p232
aVtheir curiosity, their love of learning \u2014
p233
aVbegin to study what they love,
p234
aVlove what they study,
p235
aVfollow their passion ...
p236
aVgetting stimulated by their intelligence,
p237
aVfollow paths of inquiry that they really want to.
p238
aa(lp239
VAfter all, it was Eric and Kevin,
p240
aVtwo years ago,
p241
aVjust exactly these kinds of young men,
p242
aVwho prompted me and worked with me,
p243
aVand still do,
p244
aVin the study of indebted students in America.
p245
aa(lp246
VThank you for your attention.

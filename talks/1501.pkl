VI'm a gamer, so I like to have goals.
p5
aVI like special missions and secret objectives.
p6
aVSo here's my special mission for this talk:
p7
aVI'm going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room
p8
aVby seven and a half minutes.
p9
aVLiterally, you will live seven and a half minutes longer
p10
aVthan you would have otherwise,
p11
aVjust because you watched this talk.
p12
aa(lp13
VSome of you are looking a little bit skeptical.
p14
aVThat's okay, because check it out \u2014
p15
aVI have math to prove that it is possible.
p16
aVIt won't make much sense now.
p17
aVI'll explain it all later,
p18
aVjust pay attention to the number at the bottom:
p19
aV+7.68245837 minutes.
p20
aVThat will be my gift to you if I'm successful in my mission.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, you have a secret mission too.
p23
aVYour mission is to figure out how you want to spend
p24
aVyour extra seven and a half minutes.
p25
aVAnd I think you should do something unusual with them,
p26
aVbecause these are bonus minutes.
p27
aVYou weren't going to have them anyway.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, because I'm a game designer, you might be thinking to yourself,
p30
aVI know what she wants us to do with those minutes,
p31
aVshe wants us to spend them playing games.
p32
aVNow this is a totally reasonable assumption,
p33
aVgiven that I have made quite a habit of encouraging people
p34
aVto spend more time playing games.
p35
aVFor example, in my first TED Talk,
p36
aVI did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week,
p37
aVas a planet, playing video games.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, 21 billion hours, it's a lot of time.
p40
aVIt's so much time, in fact, that the number one unsolicited comment
p41
aVthat I have heard from people all over the world
p42
aVsince I gave that talk, is this:
p43
aVJane, games are great and all, but on your deathbed,
p44
aVare you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds?
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VThis idea is so pervasive \u2014
p49
aVthat games are a waste of time that we will come to regret \u2014
p50
aVthat I hear it literally everywhere I go.
p51
aVFor example, true story:
p52
aVJust a few weeks ago,
p53
aVthis cab driver, upon finding out that a friend and I were in town
p54
aVfor a game developers' conference,
p55
aVturned around and said \u2014 and I quote \u2014
p56
aV"I hate games. Waste of life.
p57
aVImagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time."
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, I want to take this problem seriously.
p60
aVI want games to be a force for good in the world.
p61
aVI don't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing,
p62
aVtime that I encouraged them to spend.
p63
aVSo I have been thinking about this question a lot lately.
p64
aVWhen we're on our deathbeds,
p65
aVwill we regret the time we spent playing games?
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, this may surprise you, but it turns out
p68
aVthere is actually some scientific research on this question.
p69
aVIt's true.
p70
aVHospice workers,
p71
aVthe people who take care of us at the end of our lives,
p72
aVrecently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets
p73
aVthat people say when they are literally on their deathbeds.
p74
aVAnd that's what I want to share with you today \u2014
p75
aVthe top five regrets of the dying.
p76
aa(lp77
VNumber one:
p78
aVI wish I hadn't worked so hard.
p79
aVNumber two:
p80
aVI wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
p81
aVNumber three:
p82
aVI wish I had let myself be happier.
p83
aVNumber four:
p84
aVI wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.
p85
aVAnd number five:
p86
aVI wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams,
p87
aVinstead of what others expected of me.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, as far as I know, no one ever told one of the hospice workers,
p90
aV"I wish I'd spent more time playing video games,"
p91
aVbut when I hear these top five regrets of the dying,
p92
aVI can't help but hear five deep human cravings
p93
aVthat games actually help us fulfill.
p94
aa(lp95
VFor example, I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
p96
aVFor many people, this means, I wish I'd spent more time
p97
aVwith my family, with my kids when they were growing up.
p98
aVWell, we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits.
p99
aVA recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family Life
p100
aVreported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids
p101
aVhave much stronger real-life relationships with them.
p102
aa(lp103
V"I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends."
p104
aVHundreds of millions of people
p105
aVuse social games like FarmVille or Words With Friends
p106
aVto stay in daily contact with real-life friends and family.
p107
aVA recent study from the University of Michigan
p108
aVshowed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship-management tools.
p109
aVThey help us stay connected with people in our social network
p110
aVthat we would otherwise grow distant from,
p111
aVif we weren't playing games together.
p112
aa(lp113
V"I wish I'd let myself be happier."
p114
aVWell, here I can't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials
p115
aVrecently conducted at East Carolina University
p116
aVthat showed that online games can outperform
p117
aVpharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression.
p118
aVJust 30 minutes of online game play a day
p119
aVwas enough to create dramatic boosts in mood
p120
aVand long-term increases in happiness.
p121
aa(lp122
V"I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self."
p123
aVWell, avatars are a way to express our true selves,
p124
aVour most heroic, idealized version of who we might become.
p125
aVYou can see that in this alter ego portrait by Robbie Cooper
p126
aVof a gamer with his avatar.
p127
aVAnd Stanford University has been doing research for five years now
p128
aVto document how playing a game with an idealized avatar
p129
aVchanges how we think and act in real life,
p130
aVmaking us more courageous, more ambitious,
p131
aVmore committed to our goals.
p132
aa(lp133
V"I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams,
p134
aVand not what others expected of me."
p135
aVAre games doing this yet?
p136
aVI'm not sure, so I've left a Super Mario question mark.
p137
aVWe're going to come back to this one.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut in the meantime, perhaps you're wondering,
p140
aVwho is this game designer to be talking to us
p141
aVabout deathbed regrets?
p142
aVAnd it's true, I've never worked in a hospice,
p143
aVI've never been on my deathbed.
p144
aVBut recently I did spend three months in bed, wanting to die.
p145
aVReally wanting to die.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow let me tell you that story.
p148
aVIt started two years ago, when I hit my head and got a concussion.
p149
aVThe concussion didn't heal properly,
p150
aVand after 30 days, I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches,
p151
aVnausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.
p152
aVMy doctor told me that in order to heal my brain,
p153
aVI had to rest it.
p154
aVSo I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms.
p155
aVFor me that meant no reading, no writing, no video games,
p156
aVno work or email, no running, no alcohol, no caffeine.
p157
aVIn other words \u2014 and I think you see where this is going \u2014
p158
aVno reason to live.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VOf course it's meant to be funny,
p163
aVbut in all seriousness, suicidal ideation is quite common
p164
aVwith traumatic brain injuries.
p165
aVIt happens to one in three, and it happened to me.
p166
aVMy brain started telling me, "Jane, you want to die."
p167
aVIt said, "You're never going to get better."
p168
aVIt said, "The pain will never end."
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd these voices became so persistent and so persuasive
p171
aVthat I started to legitimately fear for my life,
p172
aVwhich is the time that I said to myself after 34 days \u2014
p173
aVand I will never forget this moment \u2014
p174
aVI said, "I am either going to kill myself
p175
aVor I'm going to turn this into a game."
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, why a game?
p178
aVI knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade
p179
aVthat when we play a game \u2014
p180
aVand this is in the scientific literature \u2014
p181
aVwe tackle tough challenges with more creativity,
p182
aVmore determination, more optimism,
p183
aVand we're more likely to reach out to others for help.
p184
aVI wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real-life challenge,
p185
aVso I created a role-playing recovery game
p186
aVcalled Jane the Concussion Slayer.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow this became my new secret identity,
p189
aVand the first thing I did as a slayer was call my twin sister \u2014
p190
aVI have an identical twin sister named Kelly \u2014
p191
aVand tell her, "I'm playing a game to heal my brain,
p192
aVand I want you to play with me."
p193
aVThis was an easier way to ask for help.
p194
aa(lp195
VShe became my first ally in the game,
p196
aVmy husband Kiyash joined next,
p197
aVand together we identified and battled the bad guys.
p198
aVNow this was anything that could trigger my symptoms
p199
aVand therefore slow down the healing process,
p200
aVthings like bright lights and crowded spaces.
p201
aVWe also collected and activated power-ups.
p202
aVThis was anything I could do on even my worst day
p203
aVto feel just a little bit good,
p204
aVjust a little bit productive.
p205
aVThings like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes,
p206
aVor getting out of bed and walking around the block just once.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow the game was that simple:
p209
aVAdopt a secret identity, recruit your allies,
p210
aVbattle the bad guys, activate the power-ups.
p211
aVBut even with a game so simple,
p212
aVwithin just a couple days of starting to play,
p213
aVthat fog of depression and anxiety went away.
p214
aVIt just vanished. It felt like a miracle.
p215
aVNow it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches
p216
aVor the cognitive symptoms.
p217
aVThat lasted for more than a year,
p218
aVand it was the hardest year of my life by far.
p219
aVBut even when I still had the symptoms,
p220
aVeven while I was still in pain, I stopped suffering.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow what happened next with the game surprised me.
p223
aVI put up some blog posts and videos online,
p224
aVexplaining how to play.
p225
aVBut not everybody has a concussion, obviously,
p226
aVnot everyone wants to be "the slayer,"
p227
aVso I renamed the game SuperBetter.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd soon, I started hearing from people all over the world
p230
aVwho were adopting their own secret identity,
p231
aVrecruiting their own allies, and they were getting "super better,"
p232
aVfacing challenges like cancer and chronic pain,
p233
aVdepression and Crohn's disease.
p234
aVEven people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS.
p235
aVAnd I could tell from their messages and their videos
p236
aVthat the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me.
p237
aVThey talked about feeling stronger and braver.
p238
aVThey talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family.
p239
aVAnd they even talked about feeling happier,
p240
aVeven though they were in pain,
p241
aVeven though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow at the time, I'm thinking to myself, what is going on here?
p244
aVI mean, how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully
p245
aVin such serious, and in some cases life-and-death, circumstances?
p246
aVI mean, if it hadn't worked for me,
p247
aVthere's no way I would have believed it was possible.
p248
aVWell, it turns out there's some science here, too.
p249
aVSome people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event.
p250
aVAnd that's what was happening to us.
p251
aa(lp252
VThe game was helping us experience
p253
aVwhat scientists call post-traumatic growth,
p254
aVwhich is not something we usually hear about.
p255
aVWe usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder.
p256
aVBut scientists now know that a traumatic event
p257
aVdoesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.
p258
aVInstead, we can use it as a springboard
p259
aVto unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives.
p260
aa(lp261
VHere are the top five things that people with post-traumatic growth say:
p262
aV"My priorities have changed."
p263
aV"I'm not afraid to do what makes me happy."
p264
aV"I feel closer to my friends and family."
p265
aV"I understand myself better. I know who I really am now."
p266
aV"I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life."
p267
aV"I'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams."
p268
aa(lp269
VNow, does this sound familiar?
p270
aVIt should, because the top five traits of post-traumatic growth
p271
aVare essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying.
p272
aVNow this is interesting, right?
p273
aVIt seems that somehow, a traumatic event
p274
aVcan unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets.
p275
aa(lp276
VBut how does it work?
p277
aVHow do you get from trauma to growth?
p278
aVOr better yet, is there a way to get all the benefits
p279
aVof post-traumatic growth without the trauma,
p280
aVwithout having to hit your head in the first place?
p281
aVThat would be good, right?
p282
aa(lp283
VI wanted to understand the phenomenon better,
p284
aVso I devoured the scientific literature, and here's what I learned.
p285
aVThere are four kinds of strength, or resilience,
p286
aVthat contribute to post-traumatic growth,
p287
aVand there are scientifically validated activities
p288
aVthat you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience,
p289
aVand you don't need a trauma to do it.
p290
aa(lp291
VI could tell you what these four types of strength are,
p292
aVbut I'd rather you experience them firsthand.
p293
aVI'd rather we all start building them up together right now.
p294
aVHere's what we're going to do.
p295
aVWe'll play a quick game together.
p296
aVThis is where you earn the seven and a half minutes
p297
aVof bonus life that I promised you earlier.
p298
aVAll you have to do is successfully complete
p299
aVthe first four SuperBetter quests.
p300
aVAnd I feel like you can do it. I have confidence in you.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo, everybody ready?
p303
aVThis is your first quest. Here we go.
p304
aVPick one: Stand up and take three steps,
p305
aVor make your hands into fists, raise them over your head
p306
aVas high as you can for five seconds, go!
p307
aVAll right, I like the people doing both.
p308
aVYou are overachievers. Very good.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VWell done, everyone.
p313
aVThat is worth +1 physical resilience,
p314
aVwhich means that your body can withstand more stress
p315
aVand heal itself faster.
p316
aVWe know from the research
p317
aVthat the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience
p318
aVis to not sit still.
p319
aVThat's all it takes.
p320
aVEvery single second that you are not sitting still,
p321
aVyou are actively improving the health of your heart,
p322
aVand your lungs and brains.
p323
aa(lp324
VEverybody ready for your next quest?
p325
aVI want you to snap your fingers exactly 50 times,
p326
aVor count backwards from 100 by seven, like this: 100, 93...
p327
aVGo!
p328
aa(lp329
V(Snapping)
p330
aa(lp331
VDon't give up.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Snapping)
p334
aa(lp335
VDon't let the people counting down from 100
p336
aVinterfere with your counting to 50.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Snapping)
p339
aa(lp340
V(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VNice. Wow. That's the first time I've ever seen that.
p343
aVBonus physical resilience. Well done, everyone.
p344
aVNow that's worth +1 mental resilience,
p345
aVwhich means you have more mental focus, more discipline,
p346
aVdetermination and willpower.
p347
aVWe know from the scientific research
p348
aVthat willpower actually works like a muscle.
p349
aVIt gets stronger the more you exercise it.
p350
aVSo tackling a tiny challenge without giving up,
p351
aVeven one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times
p352
aVor counting backwards from 100 by seven
p353
aVis actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo good job. Quest number three.
p356
aVPick one: Because of the room, fate's really determined this for you,
p357
aVbut here are the two options.
p358
aVIf you're inside, find a window and look out of it.
p359
aVIf you're outside, find a window and look in.
p360
aVOr do a quick YouTube or Google image search
p361
aVfor "baby [your favorite animal.]"
p362
aa(lp363
VDo it on your phones, or just shout out some baby animals,
p364
aVand I'll put them on the screen.
p365
aVSo, what do we want to see?
p366
aVSloth, giraffe, elephant, snake. Okay, let's see what we got.
p367
aVBaby dolphin and baby llamas. Everybody look.
p368
aVGot that?
p369
aVOkay, one more. Baby elephant.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Audience) Oh!
p372
aa(lp373
VWe're clapping for that?
p374
aVThat's amazing.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Laughter)
p377
aa(lp378
VAll right, what we're just feeling there is plus-one emotional resilience,
p379
aVwhich means you have the ability to provoke powerful,
p380
aVpositive emotions like curiosity or love,
p381
aVwhich we feel looking at baby animals,
p382
aVwhen you need them most.
p383
aa(lp384
VHere's a secret from the scientific literature for you.
p385
aVIf you can manage to experience three positive emotions
p386
aVfor every one negative emotion
p387
aVover the course of an hour, a day, a week,
p388
aVyou dramatically improve your health
p389
aVand your ability to successfully tackle any problem you're facing.
p390
aVAnd this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio.
p391
aVIt's my favorite SuperBetter trick, so keep it up.
p392
aa(lp393
VAll right, pick one, last quest:
p394
aVShake someone's hand for six seconds,
p395
aVor send someone a quick thank you
p396
aVby text, email, Facebook or Twitter. Go!
p397
aa(lp398
V(Chatting)
p399
aa(lp400
VLooking good, looking good.
p401
aVNice, nice.
p402
aVKeep it up.
p403
aVI love it!
p404
aVAll right, everybody, that is +1 social resilience,
p405
aVwhich means you actually get more strength from your friends,
p406
aVyour neighbors, your family, your community.
p407
aVNow, a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude.
p408
aVTouch is even better.
p409
aa(lp410
VHere's one more secret for you:
p411
aVShaking someone's hand for six seconds
p412
aVdramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream,
p413
aVnow that's the trust hormone.
p414
aVThat means that all of you who just shook hands
p415
aVare biochemically primed to like and want to help each other.
p416
aVThis will linger during the break,
p417
aVso take advantage of the networking opportunities.
p418
aa(lp419
V(Laughter)
p420
aa(lp421
VWell, you have successfully completed your four quests,
p422
aVlet's see if I've successfully completed my mission
p423
aVto give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life.
p424
aVNow I get to share one more little bit of science with you.
p425
aVIt turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience \u2014
p426
aVphysical, mental, emotional and social \u2014
p427
aVlive 10 years longer than everyone else.
p428
aVSo this is true.
p429
aVIf you are regularly achieving the three-to-one positive emotion ratio,
p430
aVif you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time,
p431
aVif you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day,
p432
aVif you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower,
p433
aVyou will live 10 years longer than everyone else,
p434
aVand here's where that math I showed you earlier comes in.
p435
aa(lp436
VSo, the average life expectancy in the U.S. and the U.K. is 78.1 years,
p437
aVbut we know from more than 1,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies
p438
aVthat you can add 10 years of life by boosting your four types of resilience.
p439
aVSo every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience,
p440
aVyou're actually earning .128 more years of life
p441
aVor 46 more days of life, or 67,298 more minutes of life,
p442
aVwhich means every single day, you are earning 184 minutes of life,
p443
aVor every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience,
p444
aVlike we just did together, you are earning 7.68245837
p445
aVmore minutes of life.
p446
aa(lp447
VCongratulations, those seven and a half minutes are all yours.
p448
aVYou totally earned them.
p449
aa(lp450
VYeah!
p451
aa(lp452
V(Applause)
p453
aa(lp454
VAwesome.
p455
aVWait, wait, wait.
p456
aVYou still have your special mission, your secret mission.
p457
aVHow are you going to spend these minutes of bonus life?
p458
aa(lp459
VWell, here's my suggestion.
p460
aVThese seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie's wishes.
p461
aVYou can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes.
p462
aVPretty clever, right?
p463
aVSo, if you spend these seven and a half minutes today
p464
aVdoing something that makes you happy,
p465
aVor that gets you physically active,
p466
aVor puts you in touch with someone you care about,
p467
aVor even just tackling a tiny challenge,
p468
aVyou're going to boost your resilience, so you're going to earn more minutes.
p469
aa(lp470
VAnd the good news is, you can keep going like that.
p471
aVEvery hour of the day, every day of your life,
p472
aVall the way to your deathbed,
p473
aVwhich will now be 10 years later than it would have otherwise.
p474
aVAnd when you get there, more than likely,
p475
aVyou will not have any of those top five regrets,
p476
aVbecause you will have built up the strength and resilience
p477
aVto lead a life truer to your dreams.
p478
aVAnd with 10 extra years, you might even have enough time
p479
aVto play a few more games.
p480
aa(lp481
VThank you.

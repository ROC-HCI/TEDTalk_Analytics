VYou hear that this is the era of environment \u2014 or biology, or information technology ...
p5
aVWell, it's the era of a lot of different things
p6
aVthat we're in right now. But one thing for sure:
p7
aVit's the era of change. There's more change going on
p8
aVthan ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth.
p9
aVAnd you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it
p10
aVso that you really understand it.
p11
aVAnd I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this.
p12
aVI've tried to show in this \u2014 though the color doesn't come out \u2014
p13
aVthat what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble
p14
aVthat you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past,
p15
aVa generation future \u2014 your parents, your kids, things you can change
p16
aVover the next few decades \u2014 and this 50-year time bubble
p17
aVyou kind of move along in. And in that 50 years,
p18
aVif you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans
p19
aVon the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times
p20
aVsince I was born. When you have a new baby,
p21
aVby the time that kid gets out of high school
p22
aVmore people will be added than existed on earth when I was born.
p23
aVThis is unprecedented, and it's big.
p24
aVWhere it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, the human part related to animals: look at the left side of that.
p27
aVWhat I call the human portion \u2014 humans and their livestock and pets \u2014
p28
aVversus the natural portion \u2014 all the other wild animals and just \u2014
p29
aVthese are vertebrates and all the birds, etc.,
p30
aVin the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance?
p31
aVCertainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning,
p32
aVthe human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now.
p33
aVYou follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle \u2014
p34
aVthat's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets
p35
aVare now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth
p36
aVand all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation
p37
aVdoesn't even have to worry about this game \u2014 it is over.
p38
aVAnd the biggest problem came in the last 25 years:
p39
aVit went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent.
p40
aVAnd this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans,
p41
aVare in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods
p42
aVof old Greek myths, kind of playing with life \u2014
p43
aVand not a great deal of wisdom injected into it.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, the third curve is information technology.
p46
aVThis is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density
p47
aVof information, but it has been pretty good for showing
p48
aVa lot of other things about information technology \u2014
p49
aVcomputers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important
p50
aVis it just goes straight up through the top of the curve,
p51
aVand has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these.
p52
aVThis is the size of the earth going through that same \u2014
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aV\u2014 frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph.
p55
aVThere's no need to see the little detailed words on it.
p56
aVThat first one is humans-versus-nature;
p57
aVwe've won, there's no more gain. Human population.
p58
aVAnd so if you're looking for growth industries to get into,
p59
aVthat's not a good one \u2014 protecting natural creatures. Human population
p60
aVis going up; it's going to continue for quite a while.
p61
aVGood business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. \u2014
p62
aVthey all deal with human bodies, which require being fed,
p63
aVtransported, housed and so on. And the information technology,
p64
aVwhich connects to our brains, has no limit \u2014 now, that is a wonderful
p65
aVfield to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity?
p66
aVIt's just going up through the roof.
p67
aVAnd then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible
p68
aVwith the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo, that's the stage out of all this. I find,
p71
aVfor reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal.
p72
aVAnd the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable
p73
aVwhen my kids reach my age \u2014 and I think that's \u2014 in other words,
p74
aVthe next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share.
p75
aVI think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable;
p76
aVeconomically, it's achievable; politically,
p77
aVit means sort of the habits, institutions of people \u2014 it's impossible.
p78
aVThe institutions of the past with all their inertia
p79
aVare just irrelevant for the future, except they're there
p80
aVand we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time
p81
aVtrying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual \u2014
p82
aVand whatever else we devote ourselves to.
p83
aVAnd in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills,
p84
aVsomehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school,
p85
aVwhich is putting information and dogma into them,
p86
aVget them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue
p87
aVabout serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book,
p88
aVthink broadly or creative. They can be.
p89
aVOur school systems are very flawed and do not reward you
p90
aVfor the things that are important in life
p91
aVor for the survival of civilization; they reward you
p92
aVfor a lot of learning and sopping up stuff.
p93
aVWe can't go into that today because there isn't time \u2014
p94
aVit's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future
p95
aVthere is an essential feature \u2014 necessary, but not sufficient \u2014
p96
aVwhich is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things
p97
aVwith more efficiency using less energy, less material.
p98
aVYour great-great grandparents got by on muscle power,
p99
aVand yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential
p100
aVfor our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have
p101
aVwe can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc.
p102
aa(lp103
VLet me just rush very quickly through things that we've done.
p104
aVHuman-powered airplane \u2014 Gossamer Condor sort of started me
p105
aVin this direction in 1976 and 77,
p106
aVwinning the Kremer prize in aviation history,
p107
aVfollowed by the Albatross. And we began
p108
aVmaking various odd planes and creatures.
p109
aVHere's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail.
p110
aVTrying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow
p111
aVwith the feathered end forward. It was a tough job,
p112
aVand boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature.
p113
aVThis was the full size of the original creature.
p114
aVWe did things on land, in the air, on water \u2014
p115
aVvehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics
p116
aVor electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same,
p117
aVwhether its land, air or water.
p118
aVI'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane \u2014
p119
aV165 miles carrying a person from France to England
p120
aVas a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part
p121
aVof our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors \u2014
p122
aVthe Sunracer \u2014 that won the race in Australia.
p123
aVWe got a lot of people thinking about electric cars,
p124
aVwhat you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that
p125
aVnow is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact,
p126
aVthey sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them
p127
aVon their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort
p128
aVinto turning it into a commercial product.
p129
aa(lp130
VWith that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape,
p131
aVwhich shows a little airplane for surveillance
p132
aVand moving to a giant airplane.
p133
aVNarrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance \u2014
p134
aVin effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example
p135
aVof where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote
p136
aVfrom the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble
p137
aVand launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
p138
aVIt sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
p139
aVWith onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously,
p140
aVand it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.
p141
aVThe modern sailplane is superbly efficient.
p142
aVSome can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent.
p143
aVThey are powered only by the energy
p144
aVthey can extract from the atmosphere \u2014
p145
aVan atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy.
p146
aVHumans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous
p147
aVin providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown
p148
aVover 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet.
p149
aV(Music)
p150
aVThe Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol
p151
aVthat photovoltaic cells can produce real power
p152
aVand will be part of the world's energy future.
p153
aVIn 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England,
p154
aVsolely on the power of sunbeams,
p155
aVand established a basis for the Pathfinder.
p156
aV(Music)
p157
aVThe message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology
p158
aVcan be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less \u2014
p159
aVgains that can help us attain a desirable balance
p160
aVbetween technology and nature. The stakes are high
p161
aVas we speed toward a challenging future.
p162
aVBuckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers
p163
aVon spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew,
p164
aVcan and must do more with less \u2014 much less."
p165
aa(lp166
VPaul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute,
p167
aVput in as quickly as you can, which \u2014 this will show
p168
aVthe Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii,
p169
aVand will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it
p170
aVafter it had just flown to 71,530 feet \u2014
p171
aVhigher than any propeller airplane has ever flown.
p172
aVIt's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun \u2014
p173
aVby having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there.
p174
aVIt's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored.
p175
aVAnd we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort,
p176
aVand with wonderful results like that flight.
p177
aVAnd we're working on a bigger plane \u2014 220-foot span \u2014
p178
aVand an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell
p179
aVthat can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night,
p180
aVand stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time.
p181
aV(Music)
p182
aVRay Morgan's voice will come in here.
p183
aVThere he's the project manager. Anything they do
p184
aVis certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ...
p185
aVsome things he showed as a celebration at the very end.
p186
aVRay Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii.
p187
aVFor those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home.
p188
aVThe friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality
p189
aVshown by our Hawaiian and military hosts \u2014
p190
aV(Music)
p191
aVthis is starting \u2014
p192
aVmade the experience enjoyable and unforgettable.
p193
aVPM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet
p194
aVwhile the plane is flying. And it's exploring
p195
aVwithout polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere,
p196
aVthe blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth
p197
aVand permits life on earth to be the success that it is \u2014
p198
aVprobing that is very important. And also we consider it
p199
aVas a sort of poor man's stationary satellite,
p200
aVbecause it can stay right overhead for months at a time,
p201
aV2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite.
p202
aVWe couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut now let's look at the other end.
p205
aVIn the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane
p206
aVsurveillance drone that Keenan has developed
p207
aVand just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos
p208
aVthat have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams,
p209
aVhis weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here
p210
aVis a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces \u2014
p211
aVthat includes the video camera, the batteries that run it,
p212
aVthe telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope,
p213
aVwith the same success that we had last night when we did the practice.
p214
aVSo Matt Keenan, just any time you're \u2014
p215
aVall right
p216
aV\u2014 ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure
p217
aVthat it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees.
p218
aVYou can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it,
p219
aVlooking out of its camera.
p220
aVMatt Keenan: It's switched on.
p221
aVPM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go.
p222
aVMK: Can you bring up the house lights?
p223
aVPM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better
p224
aVand be able to fly the plane better.
p225
aVMK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in.
p226
aVHere we go.
p227
aV(Applause)
p228
aVPM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it \u2014
p229
aVthere it goes.
p230
aVOh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe
p231
aVto have that near the end of the flight, perhaps.
p232
aVWe get to do the classic.
p233
aVAll right.
p234
aVIf this hits you, it will not hurt you.
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVOK.
p237
aV(Applause)
p238
aVThank you very much. Thank you.
p239
aV(Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VBut now, as they say in infomercials,
p242
aVwe have something much better for you, which we're working on:
p243
aVplanes that are only six inches \u2014 15 centimeters \u2014 in size.
p244
aVAnd Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month,
p245
aVshowing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size
p246
aVwill have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly
p247
aVnine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour
p248
aVwith just a little battery in it.
p249
aVBut there's a lot of technology going.
p250
aVThere are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things.
p251
aVThis one doesn't have the video in it,
p252
aVbut you get a little feel from what it can do.
p253
aVOK, here we go.
p254
aV(Laughter)
p255
aVMK: Sorry.
p256
aVOK.
p257
aV(Applause)
p258
aVPM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think \u2014
p259
aVI lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light.
p260
aVIt hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVBut you're beginning to see what can be done.
p263
aVWe're working on projects now \u2014 even wing-flapping things
p264
aVthe size of hawk moths \u2014 DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA.
p265
aa(lp266
VWhere all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know.
p267
aVBut like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things
p268
aVthat are way beyond existing technology,
p269
aVyou can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology.
p270
aVYou can do amazing things when you realize
p271
aVwhat nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales,
p272
aVyou realize we have a lot to learn from nature \u2014 not with 747s \u2014
p273
aVbut when you get down to the nature's realm,
p274
aVnature has 200 million years of experience.
p275
aVIt never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake,
p276
aVyou don't leave any progeny.
p277
aVWe should have nothing but success stories from nature,
p278
aVfor you or for birds, and we're learning a lot
p279
aVfrom its fascinating subjects.
p280
aa(lp281
VIn concluding, I want to get back to the big picture
p282
aVand I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective.
p283
aVThe first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences
p284
aVand had it say what I wanted.
p285
aVOver billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted
p286
aVa thin covering of life \u2014 complex, improbable, wonderful
p287
aVand fragile. Suddenly, we humans \u2014 a recently arrived species,
p288
aVno longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature \u2014
p289
aVhave grown in population, technology and intelligence
p290
aVto a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.
p291
aVAnd that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom;
p292
aVwe're high on technology. Where's it going to lead?
p293
aa(lp294
VWell, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush.
p295
aVEvery 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one \u2014
p296
aVtries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger.
p297
aVSort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates
p298
aVand trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans
p299
aVwith caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs.
p300
aVAnd then we get to the civilization above the little TV set
p301
aVwith a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems,
p302
aVand some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead \u2014 I have no idea.
p303
aVAnd so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there,
p304
aVbut you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast.
p305
aVThis is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it.
p306
aVAnd that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years.
p307
aVThings are going on this decade, next decade;
p308
aVit's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do.
p309
aVAnd if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be \u2014
p310
aVdesirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age \u2014
p311
aVI think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning,
p312
aVnot a forecast. That was before \u2014
p313
aVI painted this before we started in on making robotic versions
p314
aVof hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder
p315
aVseriously \u2014 was this more of a forecast than I wanted?
p316
aVI personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth
p317
aVis not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based.
p318
aVAnd so where it all goes, I don't know.
p319
aa(lp320
VThe one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here
p321
aVis an utterly impractical flight vehicle,
p322
aVwhich is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that \u2014
p323
aVrubber-band powered \u2014 that we'll show you.
p324
aVMK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram.
p325
aVPM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns
p326
aVand it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram.
p327
aVThe tube there's hollow, about paper-thin.
p328
aVAnd if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you.
p329
aVBut if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it.
p330
aVSo, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something.
p331
aVAnd when it comes down \u2014 and we'll see how it goes.
p332
aVWe consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED.
p333
aV(Applause)
p334
aVAnd you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been \u2014
p335
aV(Laughter)
p336
aV(Applause)
p337
aVUnfortunately, we have some light bulb changes.
p338
aVWe can probably get it down,
p339
aVbut it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there \u2014
p340
aV(Laughter)
p341
aV\u2014 than it ever had. And I wanted to make \u2014
p342
aV(Applause)
p343
aVjust \u2014
p344
aV(Applause)
p345
aa(lp346
VBut I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous;
p347
aVthere's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters
p348
aVlike that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 \u2014 a long, long time ago \u2014
p349
aVthere wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor,
p350
aVthere wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger,
p351
aVthere wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate
p352
aVon zero-emission vehicles in California.
p353
aVA lot of these things \u2014 or similar \u2014 would have happened some time,
p354
aVprobably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time
p355
aVI was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams,
p356
aVlike they're trying to get in education systems.
p357
aVSo I think that, as a symbol, it's important.
p358
aVAnd I believe that also is important. You can think of it
p359
aVas a sort of a symbol for learning and TED
p360
aVthat somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature,
p361
aVand puts it all together in things that are \u2014
p362
aVthat make this conference, I think, more important than any
p363
aVthat's taken place in this country in this decade.
p364
aVThank you. (Applause)

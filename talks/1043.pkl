VThe first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you.
p5
aVThe second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author
p6
aVand dear friend and co-teacher.
p7
aVKen and I have been working together
p8
aVfor almost 40 years.
p9
aVThat's Ken Sharpe over there.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Applause)
p12
aa(lp13
VSo there is among many people \u2014
p14
aVcertainly me and most of the people I talk to \u2014
p15
aVa kind of collective dissatisfaction
p16
aVwith the way things are working,
p17
aVwith the way our institutions run.
p18
aVOur kids' teachers seem to be failing them.
p19
aVOur doctors don't know who the hell we are,
p20
aVand they don't have enough time for us.
p21
aVWe certainly can't trust the bankers,
p22
aVand we certainly can't trust the brokers.
p23
aVThey almost brought the entire financial system down.
p24
aVAnd even as we do our own work,
p25
aVall too often,
p26
aVwe find ourselves having to choose
p27
aVbetween doing what we think is the right thing
p28
aVand doing the expected thing,
p29
aVor the required thing,
p30
aVor the profitable thing.
p31
aVSo everywhere we look,
p32
aVpretty much across the board,
p33
aVwe worry that the people we depend on
p34
aVdon't really have our interests at heart.
p35
aVOr if they do have our interests at heart,
p36
aVwe worry that they don't know us well enough
p37
aVto figure out what they need to do
p38
aVin order to allow us
p39
aVto secure those interests.
p40
aVThey don't understand us.
p41
aVThey don't have the time to get to know us.
p42
aa(lp43
VThere are two kinds of responses
p44
aVthat we make
p45
aVto this sort of general dissatisfaction.
p46
aVIf things aren't going right,
p47
aVthe first response is:
p48
aVlet's make more rules,
p49
aVlet's set up a set
p50
aVof detailed procedures
p51
aVto make sure that people will do the right thing.
p52
aVGive teachers scripts
p53
aVto follow in the classroom,
p54
aVso even if they don't know what they're doing
p55
aVand don't care about the welfare of our kids,
p56
aVas long as they follow the scripts,
p57
aVour kids will get educated.
p58
aVGive judges a list of mandatory sentences
p59
aVto impose for crimes,
p60
aVso that you don't need to rely
p61
aVon judges using their judgment.
p62
aVInstead, all they have to do
p63
aVis look up on the list
p64
aVwhat kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.
p65
aVImpose limits
p66
aVon what credit card companies can charge in interest
p67
aVand on what they can charge in fees.
p68
aVMore and more rules
p69
aVto protect us
p70
aVagainst an indifferent, uncaring
p71
aVset of institutions we have to deal with.
p72
aa(lp73
VOr \u2014 or maybe and \u2014
p74
aVin addition to rules,
p75
aVlet's see if we can come up
p76
aVwith some really clever incentives
p77
aVso that, even if the people we deal with
p78
aVdon't particularly want to serve our interests,
p79
aVit is in their interest
p80
aVto serve our interest \u2014
p81
aVthe magic incentives
p82
aVthat will get people to do the right thing
p83
aVeven out of pure selfishness.
p84
aVSo we offer teachers bonuses
p85
aVif the kids they teach
p86
aVscore passing grades on these big test scores
p87
aVthat are used to evaluate
p88
aVthe quality of school systems.
p89
aa(lp90
VRules and incentives \u2014
p91
aV"sticks" and "carrots."
p92
aVWe passed a bunch of rules
p93
aVto regulate the financial industry
p94
aVin response to the recent collapse.
p95
aVThere's the Dodd-Frank Act,
p96
aVthere's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency
p97
aVthat is temporarily being headed through the backdoor
p98
aVby Elizabeth Warren.
p99
aVMaybe these rules
p100
aVwill actually improve
p101
aVthe way these financial services companies behave.
p102
aVWe'll see.
p103
aVIn addition, we are struggling
p104
aVto find some way to create incentives
p105
aVfor people in the financial services industry
p106
aVthat will have them more interested
p107
aVin serving the long-term interests
p108
aVeven of their own companies,
p109
aVrather than securing short-term profits.
p110
aVSo if we find just the right incentives,
p111
aVthey'll do the right thing \u2014 as I said \u2014 selfishly,
p112
aVand if we come up with the right rules and regulations,
p113
aVthey won't drive us all over a cliff.
p114
aVAnd Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know
p115
aVthat you need to reign in the bankers.
p116
aVIf there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse
p117
aVit is that.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut what we believe,
p120
aVand what we argue in the book,
p121
aVis that there is no set of rules,
p122
aVno matter how detailed,
p123
aVno matter how specific,
p124
aVno matter how carefully monitored
p125
aVand enforced,
p126
aVthere is no set of rules
p127
aVthat will get us what we need.
p128
aVWhy? Because bankers are smart people.
p129
aVAnd, like water,
p130
aVthey will find cracks
p131
aVin any set of rules.
p132
aVYou design a set of rules that will make sure
p133
aVthat the particular reason
p134
aVwhy the financial system "almost-collapse"
p135
aVcan't happen again.
p136
aVIt is naive beyond description
p137
aVto think that having blocked
p138
aVthis source of financial collapse,
p139
aVyou have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.
p140
aVSo it's just a question of waiting for the next one
p141
aVand then marveling at how we could have been so stupid
p142
aVas not to protect ourselves against that.
p143
aa(lp144
VWhat we desperately need,
p145
aVbeyond, or along with, better rules
p146
aVand reasonably smart incentives,
p147
aVis we need virtue.
p148
aVWe need character.
p149
aVWe need people who want to do the right thing.
p150
aVAnd in particular,
p151
aVthe virtue that we need most of all
p152
aVis the virtue that Aristotle called
p153
aV"practical wisdom."
p154
aVPractical wisdom
p155
aVis the moral will
p156
aVto do the right thing
p157
aVand the moral skill
p158
aVto figure out what the right thing is.
p159
aVSo Aristotle was very interested in watching
p160
aVhow the craftsmen around him worked.
p161
aVAnd he was impressed
p162
aVat how they would improvise
p163
aVnovel solutions to novel problems \u2014
p164
aVproblems that they hadn't anticipated.
p165
aVSo one example is he sees these stonemasons
p166
aVworking on the Isle of Lesbos,
p167
aVand they need to measure out
p168
aVround columns.
p169
aVWell if you think about it,
p170
aVit's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.
p171
aVSo what do they do?
p172
aVThey fashion a novel solution to the problem.
p173
aVThey created a ruler that bends,
p174
aVwhat we would call these days a tape measure \u2014
p175
aVa flexible rule,
p176
aVa rule that bends.
p177
aVAnd Aristotle said,
p178
aV"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes
p179
aVto design rounded columns,
p180
aVyou need to bend the rule."
p181
aVAnd Aristotle said
p182
aVoften in dealing with other people,
p183
aVwe need to bend the rules.
p184
aa(lp185
VDealing with other people
p186
aVdemands a kind of flexibility
p187
aVthat no set of rules can encompass.
p188
aVWise people know when and how
p189
aVto bend the rules.
p190
aVWise people know how to improvise.
p191
aVThe way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,
p192
aVthey are kind of like jazz musicians.
p193
aVThe rules are like the notes on the page,
p194
aVand that gets you started,
p195
aVbut then you dance around the notes on the page,
p196
aVcoming up with just the right combination
p197
aVfor this particular moment
p198
aVwith this particular set of fellow players.
p199
aVSo for Aristotle,
p200
aVthe kind
p201
aVof rule-bending,
p202
aVrule exception-finding and improvisation
p203
aVthat you see in skilled craftsmen
p204
aVis exactly what you need
p205
aVto be a skilled moral craftsman.
p206
aVAnd in interactions with people,
p207
aValmost all the time,
p208
aVit is this kind of flexibility that is required.
p209
aVA wise person knows when to bend the rules.
p210
aVA wise person knows when to improvise.
p211
aVAnd most important,
p212
aVa wise person does this improvising and rule-bending
p213
aVin the service of the right aims.
p214
aVIf you are a rule-bender and an improviser
p215
aVmostly to serve yourself,
p216
aVwhat you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.
p217
aVSo it matters that you do this wise practice
p218
aVin the service of others
p219
aVand not in the service of yourself.
p220
aVAnd so the will to do the right thing
p221
aVis just as important as the moral skill
p222
aVof improvisation
p223
aVand exception-finding.
p224
aVTogether they comprise practical wisdom,
p225
aVwhich Aristotle thought
p226
aVwas the master virtue.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo I'll give you an example
p229
aVof wise practice in action.
p230
aVIt's the case of Michael.
p231
aVMichael's a young guy.
p232
aVHe had a pretty low-wage job.
p233
aVHe was supporting his wife and a child,
p234
aVand the child was going to parochial school.
p235
aVThen he lost his job.
p236
aVHe panicked
p237
aVabout being able to support his family.
p238
aVOne night, he drank a little too much,
p239
aVand he robbed a cab driver \u2014
p240
aVstole 50 dollars.
p241
aVHe robbed him at gunpoint.
p242
aVIt was a toy gun.
p243
aVHe got caught. He got tried.
p244
aVHe got convicted.
p245
aVThe Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines
p246
aVrequired a minimum sentence for a crime like this
p247
aVof two years, 24 months.
p248
aVThe judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer
p249
aVthought that this made no sense.
p250
aVHe had never committed a crime before.
p251
aVHe was a responsible husband and father.
p252
aVHe had been faced with desperate circumstances.
p253
aVAll this would do is wreck a family.
p254
aVAnd so she improvised a sentence \u2014 11 months,
p255
aVand not only that,
p256
aVbut release every day to go to work.
p257
aVSpend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.
p258
aVHe did. He served out his sentence.
p259
aVHe made restitution
p260
aVand found himself a new job.
p261
aVAnd the family was united.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd it seemed on the road
p264
aVto some sort of a decent life \u2014
p265
aVa happy ending to a story
p266
aVinvolving wise improvisation
p267
aVfrom a wise judge.
p268
aVBut it turned out
p269
aVthe prosecutor was not happy
p270
aVthat Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines
p271
aVand sort of invented her own,
p272
aVand so he appealed.
p273
aVAnd he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence
p274
aVfor armed robbery.
p275
aVHe did after all have a toy gun.
p276
aVThe mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery
p277
aVis five years.
p278
aVHe won the appeal.
p279
aVMichael was sentenced to five years in prison.
p280
aVJudge Forer had to follow the law.
p281
aVAnd by the way, this appeal went through
p282
aVafter he had finished serving his sentence,
p283
aVso he was out and working at a job
p284
aVand taking care of his family
p285
aVand he had to go back into jail.
p286
aVJudge Forer did what she was required to do,
p287
aVand then she quit the bench.
p288
aVAnd Michael disappeared.
p289
aVSo that is an example,
p290
aVboth of wisdom in practice
p291
aVand the subversion of wisdom
p292
aVby rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.
p293
aa(lp294
VNow consider Ms. Dewey.
p295
aVMs. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school.
p296
aVShe found herself listening to a consultant one day
p297
aVwho was trying to help teachers
p298
aVboost the test scores of the kids,
p299
aVso that the school
p300
aVwould reach the elite category
p301
aVin percentage of kids passing big tests.
p302
aVAll these schools in Texas compete with one another
p303
aVto achieve these milestones,
p304
aVand there are bonuses and various other treats
p305
aVthat come if you beat the other schools.
p306
aVSo here was the consultant's advice:
p307
aVfirst, don't waste your time on kids
p308
aVwho are going to pass the test no matter what you do.
p309
aVSecond, don't waste your time
p310
aVon kids who can't pass the test
p311
aVno matter what you do.
p312
aVThird, don't waste your time
p313
aVon kids who moved into the district
p314
aVtoo late for their scores to be counted.
p315
aVFocus all of your time and attention
p316
aVon the kids who are on the bubble,
p317
aVthe so-called "bubble kids" \u2014
p318
aVkids where your intervention
p319
aVcan get them just maybe over the line
p320
aVfrom failing to passing.
p321
aVSo Ms. Dewey heard this,
p322
aVand she shook her head in despair
p323
aVwhile fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on
p324
aVand nodding approvingly.
p325
aVIt's like they were about to go play a football game.
p326
aVFor Ms. Dewey,
p327
aVthis isn't why she became a teacher.
p328
aa(lp329
VNow Ken and I are not naive,
p330
aVand we understand that you need to have rules.
p331
aVYou need to have incentives.
p332
aVPeople have to make a living.
p333
aVBut the problem
p334
aVwith relying on rules and incentives
p335
aVis that they demoralize
p336
aVprofessional activity,
p337
aVand they demoralize professional activity
p338
aVin two senses.
p339
aVFirst, they demoralize the people
p340
aVwho are engaged in the activity.
p341
aVJudge Forer quits,
p342
aVand Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.
p343
aVAnd second,
p344
aVthey demoralize the activity itself.
p345
aVThe very practice is demoralized,
p346
aVand the practitioners are demoralized.
p347
aVIt creates people \u2014
p348
aVwhen you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing \u2014
p349
aVit creates people
p350
aVwho are addicted to incentives.
p351
aVThat is to say, it creates people
p352
aVwho only do things for incentives.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow the striking thing about this
p355
aVis that psychologists have known this
p356
aVfor 30 years.
p357
aVPsychologists have known
p358
aVabout the negative consequences of incentivizing everything
p359
aVfor 30 years.
p360
aVWe know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,
p361
aVthey stop caring about the drawing
p362
aVand care only about the reward.
p363
aVIf you reward kids for reading books,
p364
aVthey stop caring about what's in the books
p365
aVand only care about how long they are.
p366
aVIf you reward teachers for kids' test scores,
p367
aVthey stop caring about educating
p368
aVand only care about test preparation.
p369
aVIf you were to reward doctors
p370
aVfor doing more procedures \u2014
p371
aVwhich is the current system \u2014 they would do more.
p372
aVIf instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,
p373
aVthey will do fewer.
p374
aVWhat we want, of course,
p375
aVis doctors who do just the right amount of procedures
p376
aVand do the right amount for the right reason \u2014
p377
aVnamely, to serve the welfare of their patients.
p378
aVPsychologists have known this for decades,
p379
aVand it's time for policymakers
p380
aVto start paying attention
p381
aVand listen to psychologists a little bit,
p382
aVinstead of economists.
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd it doesn't have to be this way.
p385
aVWe think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.
p386
aVWe identify one set of people
p387
aVin all of these practices
p388
aVwho we call canny outlaws.
p389
aVThese are people
p390
aVwho, being forced to operate
p391
aVin a system that demands rule-following
p392
aVand creates incentives,
p393
aVfind away around the rules,
p394
aVfind a way to subvert the rules.
p395
aVSo there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,
p396
aVand they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.
p397
aVAnd so what they do is they follow the scripts,
p398
aVbut they follow the scripts at double-time
p399
aVand squirrel away little bits of extra time
p400
aVduring which they teach in the way
p401
aVthat they actually know is effective.
p402
aVSo these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,
p403
aVand they're incredibly admirable,
p404
aVbut there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity
p405
aVin the face of a system
p406
aVthat either roots them out
p407
aVor grinds them down.
p408
aa(lp409
VSo canny outlaws are better than nothing,
p410
aVbut it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw
p411
aVsustaining that for an indefinite period of time.
p412
aVMore hopeful
p413
aVare people we call system-changers.
p414
aVThese are people who are looking
p415
aVnot to dodge the system's rules and regulations,
p416
aVbut to transform the system,
p417
aVand we talk about several.
p418
aVOne in particular
p419
aVis a judge named Robert Russell.
p420
aVAnd one day he was faced
p421
aVwith the case of Gary Pettengill.
p422
aVPettengill was a 23-year-old vet
p423
aVwho had planned to make the army a career,
p424
aVbut then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,
p425
aVand that forced him to take a medical discharge.
p426
aVHe was married, he had a third kid on the way,
p427
aVhe suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,
p428
aVand recurrent nightmares,
p429
aVand he had started using marijuana
p430
aVto ease some of the symptoms.
p431
aVHe was only able to get part-time work because of his back,
p432
aVand so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table
p433
aVand take care of his family.
p434
aVSo he started selling marijuana.
p435
aVHe was busted in a drug sweep.
p436
aVHis family was kicked out of their apartment,
p437
aVand the welfare system
p438
aVwas threatening to take away his kids.
p439
aa(lp440
VUnder normal sentencing procedures,
p441
aVJudge Russell would have had little choice
p442
aVbut to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time
p443
aVas a drug felon.
p444
aVBut Judge Russell did have an alternative.
p445
aVAnd that's because he was in a special court.
p446
aVHe was in a court called the Veterans' Court.
p447
aVIn the Veterans' Court \u2014
p448
aVthis was the first of its kind in the United States.
p449
aVJudge Russell created the Veterans' Court.
p450
aVIt was a court only for veterans
p451
aVwho had broken the law.
p452
aVAnd he had created it exactly because
p453
aVmandatory sentencing laws
p454
aVwere taking the judgment out of judging.
p455
aVNo one wanted non-violent offenders \u2014
p456
aVand especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot \u2014
p457
aVto be thrown into prison.
p458
aVThey wanted to do something about what we all know,
p459
aVnamely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.
p460
aVAnd what the Veterans' Court did,
p461
aVwas it treated each criminal as an individual,
p462
aVtried to get inside their problems,
p463
aVtried to fashion responses to their crimes
p464
aVthat helped them to rehabilitate themselves,
p465
aVand didn't forget about them once the judgment was made.
p466
aVStayed with them, followed up on them,
p467
aVmade sure that they were sticking to whatever plan
p468
aVhad been jointly developed
p469
aVto get them over the hump.
p470
aa(lp471
VThere are now 22 cities
p472
aVthat have Veterans' Courts like this.
p473
aVWhy has the idea spread?
p474
aVWell, one reason is
p475
aVthat Judge Russell
p476
aVhas now seen 108 vets
p477
aVin his Veterans' Court
p478
aVas of February of this year,
p479
aVand out of 108,
p480
aVguess how many have gone back through
p481
aVthe revolving door of justice
p482
aVinto prison.
p483
aVNone. None.
p484
aVAnyone would glom onto
p485
aVa criminal justice system
p486
aVthat has this kind of a record.
p487
aVSo here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.
p488
aa(lp489
VThere's a banker
p490

p491
aVthat encouraged bankers \u2014 I know this is hard to believe \u2014
p492
aVencouraged bankers who worked there to do well
p493
aVby doing good for their low-income clients.
p494
aVThe bank helped finance the rebuilding
p495
aVof what was otherwise a dying community.
p496
aVThough their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards,
p497
aVthe default rate was extremely low.
p498
aVThe bank was profitable.
p499
aVThe bankers stayed with their loan recipients.
p500
aVThey didn't make loans and then sell the loans.
p501
aVThey serviced the loans.
p502
aVThey made sure that their loan recipients
p503
aVwere staying up with their payments.
p504
aVBanking hasn't always been
p505
aVthe way we read about it now in the newspapers.
p506
aVEven Goldman Sachs
p507
aVonce used to serve clients,
p508
aVbefore it turned into an institution
p509
aVthat serves only itself.
p510
aVBanking wasn't always this way,
p511
aVand it doesn't have to be this way.
p512
aa(lp513
VSo there are examples like this in medicine \u2014
p514
aVdoctors at Harvard
p515
aVwho are trying to transform medical education,
p516
aVso that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion
p517
aVand loss of empathy,
p518
aVwhich characterizes most medical students
p519
aVin the course of their medical training.
p520
aVAnd the way they do it is to give third-year medical students
p521
aVpatients who they follow for an entire year.
p522
aVSo the patients are not organ systems,
p523
aVand they're not diseases;
p524
aVthey're people, people with lives.
p525
aVAnd in order to be an effective doctor,
p526
aVyou need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.
p527
aVIn addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth,
p528
aVmentoring of one student by another,
p529
aVof all the students by the doctors,
p530
aVand the result is a generation \u2014 we hope \u2014 of doctors
p531
aVwho do have time for the people they treat.
p532
aVWe'll see.
p533
aa(lp534
VSo there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.
p535
aVEach of them shows that it is possible
p536
aVto build on and nurture character
p537
aVand keep a profession
p538
aVtrue to its proper mission \u2014
p539
aVwhat Aristotle would have called its proper telos.
p540
aVAnd Ken and I believe
p541
aVthat this is what practitioners actually want.
p542
aVPeople want to be allowed
p543
aVto be virtuous.
p544
aVThey want to have permission to do the right thing.
p545
aVThey don't want to feel
p546
aVlike they need to take a shower
p547
aVto get the moral grime off their bodies everyday
p548
aVwhen they come home from work.
p549
aa(lp550
VAristotle thought that practical wisdom
p551
aVwas the key to happiness,
p552
aVand he was right.
p553
aVThere's now a lot of research being done in psychology
p554
aVon what makes people happy,
p555
aVand the two things that jump out in study after study \u2014
p556
aVI know this will come as a shock to all of you \u2014
p557
aVthe two things that matter most to happiness
p558
aVare love and work.
p559
aVLove: managing successfully
p560
aVrelations with the people who are close to you
p561
aVand with the communities of which you are a part.
p562
aVWork: engaging in activities
p563
aVthat are meaningful and satisfying.
p564
aVIf you have that, good close relations with other people,
p565
aVwork that's meaningful and fulfilling,
p566
aVyou don't much need anything else.
p567
aa(lp568
VWell, to love well and to work well,
p569
aVyou need wisdom.
p570
aVRules and incentives don't tell you
p571
aVhow to be a good friend, how to be a good parent,
p572
aVhow to be a good spouse,
p573
aVor how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer
p574
aVor a good teacher.
p575
aVRules and incentives
p576
aVare no substitutes for wisdom.
p577
aVIndeed, we argue,
p578
aVthere is no substitute for wisdom.
p579
aVAnd so practical wisdom
p580
aVdoes not require
p581
aVheroic acts of self-sacrifice
p582
aVon the part of practitioners.
p583
aVIn giving us the will and the skill
p584
aVto do the right thing \u2014 to do right by others \u2014
p585
aVpractical wisdom also gives us
p586
aVthe will and the skill
p587
aVto do right by ourselves.

Before <em>Paradox</em> he published <a href=\\"http://geni.us/costofliving\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Costs of Living</em></a>, which traces the impact of free-market thinking on the explosion of consumerism -- and <strong>the effect of the new capitalism on social and cultural institutions that once operated above the market, such as medicine, sports, and the law</strong>.<br /><br />Both books level serious criticism of modern western society, illuminating the under-reported psychological plagues of our time. But they also offer <strong>concrete ideas on addressing the problems</strong>, from a personal and societal level.</p><p>Schwartz is the author of the TED Book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/whyweworkintl\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Why We Work</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "barry_schwartz", "whotheyare": "Barry Schwartz studies the link between economics and psychology, offering startling insights into modern life.

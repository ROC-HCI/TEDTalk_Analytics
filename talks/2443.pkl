VToday I wanted to \u2014 well, this morning \u2014
p5
aVI want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation;
p6
aVabout how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking
p7
aVby getting more people into fewer cars;
p8
aVand how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets.
p9
aVAnd yes, I'm talking about smartphones ...
p10
aVnot self-driving cars.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut to get started we've got to go back over 100 years.
p13
aVBecause it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber.
p14
aVAnd if it had survived,
p15
aVthe future of transportation would probably already be here.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo let me introduce you to the jitney.
p18
aVIn 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper.
p19
aVHe was a car salesman from LA, and he had an idea.
p20
aVWell, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles,
p21
aVmy hometown,
p22
aVand he saw trolleys
p23
aVwith long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go.
p24
aVHe said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car
p25
aVthat takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney \u2014
p26
aVthat was slang for a nickel.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd so people jumped on board,
p29
aVand not just in Los Angeles but across the country.
p30
aVAnd within one year,
p31
aVby 1915,
p32
aVthere were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle,
p33
aV45,000 rides per day in Kansas
p34
aVand 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.
p35
aVTo give you some perspective,
p36
aVUber in Los Angeles
p37
aVis doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...
p38
aV100 years later.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd so these are the trolley guys,
p41
aVthe existing transportation monopoly at the time.
p42
aVThey were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut.
p43
aVAnd so they got to work
p44
aVand they went to cities across the country
p45
aVand got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd there were all kinds of regulations.
p48
aVThere were licenses \u2014 often they were pricey.
p49
aVIn some cities,
p50
aVif you were a jitney driver,
p51
aVyou were required to be in the jitney for 16 hours a day.
p52
aVIn other cities,
p53
aVthey required two jitney drivers for one jitney.
p54
aVBut there was a really interesting regulation
p55
aVwhich was they had to put a backseat light \u2014
p56
aVinstall it in every Jitney \u2014
p57
aVto stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VAll right. So what happened?
p62
aVWell, within a year this thing had taken off.
p63
aVBut the jitney, by 1919, was regulated completely out of existence.
p64
aa(lp65
VThat's unfortunate ...
p66
aVbecause, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one.
p67
aVAnd car ownership skyrocketed
p68
aVand it's no wonder that by 2007,
p69
aVthere was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States.
p70
aVAnd that phenomenon had gone global.
p71
aVIn China by 2011,
p72
aVthere were more car sales happening in China than in the US.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, all this private ownership of course had a public cost.
p75
aVIn the US, we spend 7 billion hours a year,
p76
aVwasted, sitting in traffic.
p77
aV160 billion dollars in lost productivity,
p78
aVof course also sitting in traffic,
p79
aVand one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint
p80
aVis spewed out in the air by those cars that we're sitting in.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, that's only four percent of our problem though.
p83
aVBecause if you have to own a car
p84
aVthen that means 96 percent of the time your car is sitting idle.
p85
aVAnd so, up to 30 percent of our land and our space
p86
aVis used storing these hunks of steel.
p87
aVWe even have skyscrapers built for cars.
p88
aVThat's the world we live in today.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades.
p91
aVIt's called mass transit.
p92
aVAnd even in a city like New York City,
p93
aVone of the most densely populated in the world
p94
aVand one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world,
p95
aVthere are still 2.5 million cars that go over those bridges every day.
p96
aVWhy is that?
p97
aVWell, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out
p98
aVhow to get to everybody's doorstep.
p99
aVAnd so back in San Francisco, where I live,
p100
aVthe situation's much worse,
p101
aVin fact, much worse around the world.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was \u2014
p104
aVwell, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride.
p105
aVWe didn't have any grand ambitions.
p106
aVBut it just turned out
p107
aVthat lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride,
p108
aVand ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides.
p109
aVWe saw a lot of people
p110
aVpushing the same button at the same time
p111
aVgoing essentially to the same place.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd so we started thinking about,
p114
aVwell, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one.
p115
aVBecause if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper \u2014
p116
aVup to 50 percent cheaper \u2014
p117
aVand of course for the city
p118
aVyou've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd so the big question for us was:
p121
aVwould it work?
p122
aVCould you have a cheaper ride
p123
aVcheap enough that people would be willing to share it?
p124
aVAnd the answer, fortunately, is a resounding yes.
p125
aa(lp126
VIn San Francisco,
p127
aVbefore uberPOOL, we had \u2014
p128
aVwell, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted.
p129
aVAnd the bright colors is where we have the most cars.
p130
aVAnd once we introduced uberPOOL,
p131
aVwell, you see there's not as many bright colors.
p132
aVMore people getting around the city in fewer cars,
p133
aVtaking cars off the road.
p134
aVIt looks like uberPOOL is working.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd so we rolled it out in Los Angeles
p137
aVeight months ago.
p138
aVAnd since then, we've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads
p139
aVand we've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air.
p140
aVBut the part that I'm really \u2014
p141
aa(lp142
V(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VBut my favorite statistic \u2014
p145
aVremember, I'm from LA,
p146
aVI spent years of my life
p147
aVsitting behind the wheel, going, "How do we fix this?" \u2014
p148
aVmy favorite part is that eight months later,
p149
aVwe have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, in China everything is supersized,
p152
aVand so we're doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month,
p153
aVthat's 500,000 per day.
p154
aVAnd of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen.
p155
aVIn fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.
p156
aVAnd when I talk to my team, we don't talk about,
p157
aV"Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we're done."
p158
aVHow do we get that to a million?
p159
aVAnd in China, well, that could be several million.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling.
p162
aVBut what about the suburbs?
p163
aa(lp164
VThis is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles,
p165
aVit's actually a suburb called Northridge, California,
p166
aVand, well \u2014
p167
aVlook, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever.
p168
aVAnd every morning at about the same time,
p169
aVcars roll of out their driveway,
p170
aVmost of them, one person in the car,
p171
aVand they go to work, they go to their place of work.
p172
aVSo the question for us is:
p173
aVwell, how do we turn
p174
aVall of these commuter cars \u2014
p175
aVand literally there's tens of millions of them \u2014
p176
aVhow do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars?
p177
aa(lp178
VWell, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE.
p179
aVYou get up in the morning, get ready for work, get your coffee,
p180
aVgo to your car
p181
aVand you light up the Uber app,
p182
aVand all of a sudden,
p183
aVyou become an Uber driver.
p184
aVAnd we'll match you up with one of your neighbors
p185
aVon your way to work
p186
aVand it's a really great thing.
p187
aa(lp188
VThere's just one hitch ...
p189
aVit's called regulation.
p190
aVSo 54 cents a mile, what is that?
p191
aVWell, that is what the US government
p192
aVhas determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile.
p193
aVYou can pick up anybody in the United States
p194
aVand take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice,
p195
aVfor 54 cents a mile or less.
p196
aVBut if you charge 60 cents a mile, you're a criminal.
p197
aVBut what if for 60 cents a mile
p198
aVwe could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles?
p199
aVAnd what if at 60 cents a mile
p200
aVwe could get 50 million people carpooling in the United States?
p201
aVIf we could,
p202
aVit's obviously something we should do.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney.
p205
aVIf by 1915 this thing was taking off,
p206
aVimagine without the regulations that happened,
p207
aVif that thing could just keep going.
p208
aVHow would our cities be different today?
p209
aVWould we have parks in the place of parking lots?
p210
aVWell, we lost that chance.
p211
aVBut technology has given us another opportunity.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, I'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars
p214
aVbut do we have to really wait five, 10 or even 20 years
p215
aVto make our new cities a reality?
p216
aVWith the technology in our pockets today,
p217
aVand a little smart regulation,
p218
aVwe can turn every car into a shared car,
p219
aVand we can reclaim our cities starting today.
p220
aa(lp221
VThank you.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VChris Anderson: Travis, thank you.
p226
aa(lp227
VTravis Kalanick: Thank you.
p228
aa(lp229
VCA: You know \u2014 I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding.
p230
aVYou only just talked about a small part of it here \u2014
p231
aVa powerful part \u2014
p232
aVthe idea of turning cars into public transport like that,
p233
aVit's cool.
p234
aVBut I've got a couple other questions
p235
aVbecause I know they're out there on people's minds.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo first of all, last week I think it was,
p238
aVI switched on my phone and tried to book an Uber
p239
aVand I couldn't find the app.
p240
aVYou had this very radical, very bold, brave redesign.
p241
aa(lp242
VTK: Sure.
p243
aa(lp244
VCA: How did it go?
p245
aVDid you notice other people not finding the app that day?
p246
aVAre you going to win people over for this redesign?
p247
aa(lp248
VTK: Well, first I should probably just say,
p249
aVwell, what we were trying to accomplish.
p250
aVAnd I think if you know a little bit about our history,
p251
aVit makes a lot more sense.
p252
aVWhich is, when we first got started,
p253
aVit was just black cars.
p254
aVIt was literally you push a button and get an S-Class.
p255
aVAnd so what we did
p256
aVwas almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand
p257
aVthat looked like a badge on a luxury car.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd as we've gone worldwide
p260
aVand gone from S-Classes to auto rickshaws in India,
p261
aVit became something that was important for us
p262
aVto be more accessible,
p263
aVto be more hyperlocal,
p264
aVto be about the cities we were in
p265
aVand that's what you see with the patterns and colors.
p266
aVAnd to be more iconic,
p267
aVbecause a U doesn't mean anything in Sanskrit,
p268
aVand a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.
p269
aVAnd so that was a little bit what it was about.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow, when you first roll out something like that,
p272
aVI mean, your hands are sweating,
p273
aVyou've got \u2014
p274
aVyou know, you're a little worried.
p275
aVWhat we saw is a lot of people \u2014
p276
aVactually, at the beginning, we saw a lot more people opening the app
p277
aVbecause they were curious what they would find when they opened it.
p278
aVAnd our numbers were slightly up from what we expected.
p279
aa(lp280
VCA: OK, that's cool.
p281
aa(lp282
VNow, so you, yourself, are something of an enigma, I would say.
p283
aVYour supporters and investors, who have been with you the whole way,
p284
aVbelieve that the only chance
p285
aVof sort of taking on the powerful, entrenched interests
p286
aVof taxi industry and so forth,
p287
aVis to have someone who is a fierce, relentless competitor,
p288
aVwhich you've certainly proved to be.
p289
aa(lp290
VSome people feel you've almost taken that culture too far,
p291
aVand you know \u2014 like a year or two ago
p292
aVthere was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset.
p293
aVHow did it feel like inside the company during that period?
p294
aVDid you notice a loss of business?
p295
aVDid you learn anything from that?
p296
aa(lp297
VTK: Well, look, I think \u2014
p298
aVI've been an entrepreneur since I've been in high school
p299
aVand you have \u2014
p300
aVIn various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times
p301
aVand for us,
p302
aVit was about a year and a half ago,
p303
aVand for us it was hard times, too.
p304
aa(lp305
VNow, inside, we felt like \u2014
p306
aVI guess at the end of the day
p307
aVwe felt like we were good people doing good work,
p308
aVbut on the outside that wasn't evident.
p309
aVAnd so there was a lot that we had to do
p310
aVto sort of \u2014
p311
aVWe'd gone from a very small company \u2014
p312
aVI mean if you go literally two and a half years ago,
p313
aVour company was 400 people,
p314
aVand today it's 6,500.
p315
aVAnd so when you go through that growth,
p316
aVyou have to sort of cement your cultural values
p317
aVand talk about them all of the time.
p318
aVAnd make sure that people are constantly checking
p319
aVto say, "Are we good people doing good work?"
p320
aVAnd if you check those boxes,
p321
aVthe next part of that is making sure you're telling your story.
p322
aVAnd I think we learned a lot of lessons
p323
aVbut I think at the end of it we came out stronger.
p324
aVBut it was certainly a difficult period.
p325
aa(lp326
VCA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn,
p327
aVyou're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time.
p328
aVSome Uber drivers in New York and elsewhere
p329
aVare mad as hell now because you changed the fees
p330
aVand they can barely \u2014 they claim \u2014 barely afford the deal anymore.
p331
aa(lp332
VHow \u2014
p333
aVYou know, you said that you started this originally \u2014
p334
aVjust the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride.
p335
aVThis thing's taken off,
p336
aVyou're affecting the whole global economy, basically, at this point.
p337
aVYou're being forced to be, whether you want it or not,
p338
aVa kind of global visionary who's changing the world.
p339
aVI mean \u2014 who are you?
p340
aVDo you want that?
p341
aVAre you ready to go with that and be what that takes?
p342
aa(lp343
VTK: Well, there's a few things packed in that question, so \u2014
p344
aa(lp345
V(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VFirst is on the pricing side \u2014
p348
aVI mean, keep in mind, right?
p349
aVUberX, when we first started,
p350
aVwas literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product.
p351
aVIt's now
p352
aVin many cities, half the price of a taxi.
p353
aVAnd we have all the data to show
p354
aVthat the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers.
p355
aa(lp356
VWhat happens is when the price goes down,
p357
aVpeople are more likely to take Uber
p358
aVat different times of the day than they otherwise would have,
p359
aVand they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before.
p360
aVAnd what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off,
p361
aVthey're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in.
p362
aVAnd so what that means is more trips per hour,
p363
aVmore minutes of the hour where they're productive
p364
aVand actually, earnings come up.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd we have cities where we've done literally five or six price cuts
p367
aVand have seen those price cuts go up over time.
p368
aVSo even in New York \u2014
p369
aVWe have a blog post we call "4 Septembers" \u2014
p370
aVcompare the earnings
p371
aVSeptember after September after September.
p372
aVSame month every year.
p373
aVAnd we see the earnings going up over time
p374
aVas the price comes down.
p375
aVAnd there's a perfect price point \u2014 you can't go down forever.
p376
aVAnd in those places where we bring the price down
p377
aVbut we don't see those earnings pop,
p378
aVwe bring the prices back up.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo that addresses that first part.
p381
aVAnd then the enigma and all of this \u2014
p382
aVI mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am
p383
aVis one that gets really excited about solving hard problems.
p384
aVAnd the way I like to describe it is it's kind of like a math professor.
p385
aVYou know? If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve,
p386
aVthat's a really sad math professor.
p387
aVAnd so at Uber we like the hard problems
p388
aVand we like getting excited about those and solving them.
p389
aVBut we don't want just any math problem,
p390
aVwe want the hardest ones that we can possibly find,
p391
aVand we want the one that if you solve it,
p392
aVthere's a little bit of a wow factor.
p393
aa(lp394
VCA: In a couple years' time \u2014
p395
aVsay five years' time, I don't know when \u2014
p396
aVyou roll out your incredible self-driving cars,
p397
aVat probably a lower cost than you currently pay for an Uber ride.
p398
aVWhat do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time?
p399
aa(lp400
VTK: Explain that again \u2014 at which time?
p401
aa(lp402
VCA: At the time when self-driving cars are coming \u2014
p403
aa(lp404
VTK: Sure, sure, sure. Sorry, I missed that.
p405
aa(lp406
VCA: What do you say to a driver?
p407
aVTK: Well, look, I think the first part is it's going to take \u2014
p408
aVit's likely going to take a lot longer
p409
aVthan I think some of the hype or media might expect.
p410
aVThat's part one.
p411
aa(lp412
VPart two is it's going to also take \u2014
p413
aVthere's going to be a long transition.
p414
aVThese cars will work in certain places and not in others.
p415
aa(lp416
VFor us it's an interesting challenge, right?
p417
aVBecause, well \u2014
p418
aVGoogle's been investing in this since 2007,
p419
aVTesla's going to be doing it, Apple's going to be doing it,
p420
aVthe manufacturers are going to be doing it.
p421
aVThis is a world that's going to exist, and for good reason.
p422
aVA million people die a year in cars.
p423
aVAnd we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide
p424
aVthat people are spending sitting in them, driving frustrated, anxious.
p425
aVAnd think about the quality of life that improves
p426
aVwhen you give people their time back
p427
aVand it's not so anxiety-ridden.
p428
aVSo I think there's a lot of good.
p429
aa(lp430
VAnd so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge,
p431
aVbut one for optimistic leadership,
p432
aVWhere instead of resisting \u2014
p433
aVresisting technology,
p434
aVmaybe like the taxi industry, or the trolley industry \u2014
p435
aVwe have to embrace it or be a part of the future.
p436
aa(lp437
VBut how do we optimistically lead through it?
p438
aVAre there ways to partner with cities?
p439
aVAre there ways to have education systems, vocational training, etc.,
p440
aVfor that transition period.
p441
aVIt will take a lot longer than I think we all expect,
p442

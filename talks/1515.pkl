VSo wouldn't it be amazing if our phones
p5
aVcould see the world in the same way that we do,
p6
aVas we're walking around being able
p7
aVto point a phone at anything,
p8
aVand then have it actually recognize images and objects
p9
aVlike the human brain, and then be able to pull in information
p10
aVfrom an almost infinite library of knowledge
p11
aVand experiences and ideas.
p12
aa(lp13
VWell, traditionally that was seen as science fiction,
p14
aVbut now we've moved to a world
p15
aVwhere actually this has become possible.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo the best way of explaining it is to just show it.
p18
aVWhat you can see over here is Tamara,
p19
aVwho is holding my phone that's now plugged in.
p20
aVSo let me start with this.
p21
aVWhat we have here is a painting
p22
aVof the great poet Rabbie Burns,
p23
aVand it's just a normal image,
p24
aVbut if we now switch inputs over to the phone,
p25
aVrunning our technology, you can see
p26
aVeffectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen,
p27
aVand when she points at this image,
p28
aVsomething magical happens.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter) (Bagpipes)
p31
aV(Bagpipes) (Applause)
p32
aV(Bagpipes)
p33
aVVoice: Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...
p34
aa(lp35
VMatt Mills: Now, what's great about this is,
p36
aVthere's no trickery here.
p37
aVThere's nothing done to this image.
p38
aVAnd what's great about this is the technology's
p39
aVactually allowing the phone to start to see and understand
p40
aVmuch like how the human brain does.
p41
aVNot only that, but as I move the object around,
p42
aVit's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly.
p43
aVAgain, the thing that's incredible about this is
p44
aVthis is how advanced these devices have become.
p45
aVAll the processing to do that was actually done
p46
aVon the device itself.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, this has applications everywhere,
p49
aVwhether in things like art in museums, like you just saw,
p50
aVor in the world of, say, advertising, or print journalism.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed.
p53
aVAnd here is this morning's newspaper,
p54
aVand we have some Wimbledon news, which is great.
p55
aVNow what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper
p56
aVand immediately get the bulletin.
p57
aa(lp58
VVoice: ... To the grass, and it's very important that you adapt
p59
aVand you, you have to be flexible, you have to be willing
p60
aVto change direction at a split second,
p61
aVand she does all that. She's won this title.
p62
aa(lp63
VMM: And that linking of the digital content
p64
aVto something that's physical is what we call an aura, and
p65
aVI'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo, what's great about this is it isn't just a faster,
p68
aVmore convenient way to get information in the real world,
p69
aVbut there are times when actually using this medium
p70
aVallows you to be able to display information in a way
p71
aVthat was never before possible.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo what I have here is a wireless router.
p74
aVMy American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router,
p75
aVso that everyone here understands \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p76
aVbut nonetheless, here is the device.
p77
aVSo now what I can do is, rather than getting the instructions
p78
aVfor the device online, I can simply point at it,
p79
aVthe device is recognized, and then \u2014
p80
aa(lp81
VVoice: Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable.
p82
aVThen connect the power. Finally, the yellow ethernet cable.
p83
aVCongratulations. You have now completed setup.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter) MM: Awesome. Thank you.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Applause)
p88
aa(lp89
VThe incredible work that made that possible was done
p90
aVhere in the U.K. by scientists at Cambridge,
p91
aVand they work in our offices,
p92
aVand I've got a lovely picture of them here.
p93
aVThey couldn't all be on stage, but we're going to
p94
aVbring their aura to the stage, so here they are.
p95
aVThey're not very animated. (Laughter)
p96
aVThis was the fourth take, I'm told. (Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VOkay. So, as we're talking about Cambridge,
p99
aVlet's now move on to technical advancements,
p100
aVbecause since we started putting this technology
p101
aVon mobile phones less than 12 months ago,
p102
aVthe speed and the processing in these devices
p103
aVhas grown at a really phenomenal rate,
p104
aVand that means that I can now take cinema-quality
p105
aV3D models and place them in the world around me,
p106
aVso I have one over here.
p107
aVTamara, would you like to jump in?
p108
aa(lp109
V(Music)
p110
aV(Dinosaur roaring) (Laughter)
p111
aVMM: I should leap in.
p112
aV(Music) (Dinosaur roaring)
p113
aV(Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VSo then, after the fun, comes the more emotional side
p116
aVof what we do, because effectively, this technology
p117
aVallows you to see the world through someone's eyes,
p118
aVand for that person to be able to take a moment in time
p119
aVand effectively store it and tag it to something physical
p120
aVthat exists in the real world.
p121
aVWhat's great about this is, the tools to do this are free.
p122
aVThey're open, they're available to everyone within our application,
p123
aVand educators have really got on board with the classrooms.
p124
aVSo we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks,
p125
aVteachers who've tagged up school classrooms,
p126
aVand a great example of this is a school in the U.K.
p127
aVI have a picture here from a video, and we're now going to play it.
p128
aa(lp129
VTeacher: See what happens. (Children talking) Keep going.
p130
aa(lp131
VChild: TV. (Children react)
p132
aa(lp133
VChild: Oh my God.
p134
aa(lp135
VTeacher: Now move it either side. See what happens.
p136
aVMove away from it and come back to it.
p137
aa(lp138
VChild: Oh, that is so cool.
p139
aa(lp140
VTeacher: And then, have you got it again?
p141
aa(lp142
VChild: Oh my God! How did you do that?
p143
aa(lp144
VSecond child: It's magic.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter) MM: (Laughs) So, it's not magic.
p147
aVIt's available for everyone to do,
p148
aVand actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do
p149
aVby doing one right now.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo, as sort of \u2014 I'm told it's called a stadium wave,
p152
aVso we're going to start from this side of the room
p153
aVon the count of three, and go over to here.
p154
aVTamara, are you recording?
p155
aVOkay, so are you all ready?
p156
aVOne, two, three. Go!
p157
aa(lp158
VAudience: Whooooooo!
p159
aa(lp160
VMM: Fellows are really good at that. (Laughs) (Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VOkay. Now we're going to switch back
p163
aVinto the Aurasma application,
p164
aVand what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just
p165
aVtook onto my badge, so that I can remember it forever.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow, we have lots of people who are doing this already,
p168
aVand we've talked a little bit about the educational side.
p169
aVOn the emotional side, we have people who've
p170
aVdone things like send postcards and Christmas cards
p171
aVback to their family with little messages on them.
p172
aVWe have people who have, for example,
p173
aVtaken the inside of the engine bay of an old car
p174
aVand tagged up different components within an engine,
p175
aVso that if you're stuck and you want to find out more,
p176
aVyou can point and discover the information.
p177
aa(lp178
VWe're all very, very familiar with the Internet.
p179
aVIn the last 20 years, it's really
p180
aVchanged the way that we live and work,
p181
aVand the way that we see the world, and what's great is,
p182
aVwe sort of think this is the next paradigm shift,
p183
aVbecause now we can literally take the content
p184
aVthat we share, we discover, and that we enjoy
p185
aVand make it a part of the world around us.
p186
aVIt's completely free to download this application.
p187
aVIf you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G,
p188
aVthis process is very, very quick.
p189
aa(lp190
VOh, there we are. We can save it now.
p191
aVIt's just going to do a tiny bit of processing
p192
aVto convert that image that we just took
p193
aVinto a sort of digital fingerprint,
p194
aVand the great thing is, if you're a professional user,
p195
aV\u2014 so, a newspaper \u2014 the tools are pretty much identical
p196
aVto what we've just used to create this demonstration.
p197
aVThe only difference is that you've got the ability
p198
aVto add in links and slightly more content. Are you now ready?
p199
aa(lp200
VTamara Roukaerts: We're ready to go.
p201
aa(lp202
VMM: Okay. So, I'm told we're ready, which means
p203
aVwe can now point at the image, and there you all are.
p204
aa(lp205
VMM on video: One, two, three. Go!
p206
aa(lp207
VMM: Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you.

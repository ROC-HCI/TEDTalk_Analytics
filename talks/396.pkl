VI have, like, a thing about sleeping.
p5
aVI don't sleep that much,
p6
aVand I've come to this thing about, like, not sleeping much
p7
aVas being a great virtue, after years of kind of
p8
aVbattling it as being a terrible detriment, or something.
p9
aVAnd now I really like sort of sitting up, you know.
p10
aVBut for years I've been sitting up
p11
aVand I think that, like, my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia.
p12
aVI lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly.
p13
aVSometimes I used to walk more at night.
p14
aVI walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd sometimes \u2014 actually, once it was on Page Six in the Post,
p18
aVthat I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever,
p19
aVbut I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on.
p20
aVAnd so I was following this guy.
p21
aVAnd I took a picture of his shoes,
p22
aVand we thanked each other and just went on our way.
p23
aVBut I do that all the time.
p24
aVAs a matter of fact, I think a lot of my design ideas
p25
aVcome from mistakes and tricks of the eye.
p26
aVBecause I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there,
p27
aVso many clothes out there.
p28
aVAnd the only ones that look interesting to me
p29
aVare the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course,
p30
aVor very, very surprising.
p31
aVAnd often, I'm driving in a taxi
p32
aVand I see a hole in a shirt, or something
p33
aVthat looks very interesting or pretty or functional
p34
aVin some way that I'd never seen happen before.
p35
aVAnd so I'd make the car stop, and I'd get out of the car and walk,
p36
aVand see that in fact there wasn't a hole, but it was a trick of my eye,
p37
aVit was a shadow, you know.
p38
aVOr if there was a hole I'd think like, oh damn,
p39
aVthere was actually someone thought of that thought already.
p40
aVSomeone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore.
p41
aa(lp42
VI don't know where inspiration comes from.
p43
aVIt does not come for me from research.
p44
aVI don't get necessarily inspired by research.
p45
aVAs a matter of fact, one of the most fun things
p46
aVI've ever, ever done in my whole life,
p47
aVwas this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York.
p48
aVI read "Peter and the Wolf" with this beautiful band from Juilliard.
p49
aVAnd I did like, you know, the narrator, and I read it.
p50
aVAnd I saw this really smart critic who I love.
p51
aVThis woman, Joan Acocella, who's a friend of mine,
p52
aVand she came backstage and she said,
p53
aVoh, you know, Isaac, did you know that, talking about Stalinism
p54
aVand talking about, you know, like the '30s in Russia.
p55
aVAnd I said, how do I know about Stalinism?
p56
aVI know about a wolf and a bird and, you know,
p57
aVhe ate the bird, and then in the end you hear, you know,
p58
aVyou hear the bird squeaking, or something, you know?
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I don't really know that. I don't really \u2014
p61
aVactually I do my own kind of research, you know.
p62
aVIf I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera, or something like that,
p63
aVI will do a lot of research, because it's interesting,
p64
aVnot because it's what I'm supposed to do.
p65
aVI'm very, very, very inspired by movies.
p66
aVThe color of movies and the way light makes the colors,
p67
aVlight from behind the projection,
p68
aVor light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible.
p69
aVAnd anyway, roll this little clip, I'll just show you.
p70
aVI sit up at night and I watch movies
p71
aVand I watch women in movies a lot.
p72
aVAnd I think about, you know, their roles,
p73
aVand about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at.
p74
aVBecause I look at the way women are portrayed all the time.
p75
aVWhether they're kind of glorified in this way,
p76
aVor whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified,
p77
aVor whether they're, you know, sort of denigrated, or ironically denigrated.
p78
aa(lp79
VI go back to color all the time.
p80
aVColor is something that motivates me a lot.
p81
aVIt's rarely color that I find in nature,
p82
aValthough, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color,
p83
aVnatural color is so beautiful.
p84
aVSo that's what I do. I study color a lot.
p85
aVBut for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anything
p86
aVthat is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?
p87
aVHow can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?
p88
aVI mean, that's just not possible, you know.
p89
aVAnd so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess, you know.
p90
aVI want to show you \u2014 I'm also like a big \u2014
p91
aVI go to astrologers and tarot card readers often,
p92
aVand that's another thing that motivates me a lot.
p93
aVPeople say, oh, do that. An astrologer tells me to do something.
p94
aVSo I do it.
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VWhen I was about 21, an astrologer told me
p98
aVthat I was going to meet the man of my dreams,
p99
aVand that his name was going to be Eric, right?
p100
aVSo, you know, for years I would go to bars
p101
aVand, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric
p102
aVI was humping immediately, or something.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVAnd there were times when I was actually so desperate
p105
aVI would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, "Eric!"
p106
aVAnd anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVAnd I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago.
p109
aVThe last card he pulled, which was representing my destiny
p110
aVwas this guy on like a straw boater with a cane
p111
aVand you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right?
p112
aVI want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing
p113
aVwhere I do a cabaret act.
p114
aVSo actually, check this out.
p115
aVVery embarrassing.
p116
aV(Video): Thank you. We can do anything you ask.
p117
aa(lp118
VThe name of the show is based on this story
p119
aVthat I have to tell you about my mother.
p120
aVIt's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.
p121
aVI was dating this guy, right?
p122
aVAnd this has to do with being happy, I swear.
p123
aVI was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year, right.
p124
aVAnd we were getting serious,
p125
aVso we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents.
p126
aVAnd we, you know, sort of introduced them to each other.
p127
aVMy mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother,
p128
aVwho it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing.
p129
aVYou know, homosexuality, right?
p130
aVSo my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said,
p131
aV"Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together.
p132
aVThey eat out, they see shows."
p133
aVThey eat out, they see shows.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVThat's the name of the show, they eat out, they \u2014
p136
aVthat's on my tombstone when I die.
p137
aV"He ate out, he saw shows," right?
p138
aa(lp139
VSo in editing these clips, I didn't have the audacity
p140
aVto edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub.
p141
aVSo you'll have to, like, go check it out and come see me or something.
p142
aVBecause it's mortifying, and yet it feels ...
p143
aVI don't know how to put this.
p144
aVI feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know.
p145
aVAnd at least, you know, in my case,
p146
aVbecause if I just do one thing all the time,
p147
aVI don't know, I get very, very bored. I bore very easily.
p148
aVAnd you know, I don't say that I do everything well,
p149
aVI just say that I do a lot of things, that's all.
p150
aVAnd I kind of try not to look back, you know.
p151
aVExcept, I guess, that's what staying up every night is about.
p152
aVLike, looking back and thinking, what a fool you made of yourself, you know.
p153
aVBut I guess that's okay. Right?
p154
aVBecause if you do many things
p155
aVyou get to feel lousy about everything,
p156
aVand not just one, you know.
p157
aVYou don't master feeling lousy about one thing.
p158
aVYeah, exactly.
p159
aa(lp160
VI will show you this next thing,
p161
aVspeaking of costumes for operas.
p162
aVI do work with different choreographers.
p163
aVI work with Twyla Tharp a lot,
p164
aVand I work with Mark Morris a lot,
p165
aVwho is one of my best friends.
p166
aVAnd I designed three operas with him,
p167
aVand the most recent one, "King Arthur."
p168
aVI'd been very ingrained in the dance world
p169
aVsince I was a teenager.
p170
aVI went to performing arts high school,
p171
aVwhere I was an actor.
p172
aVAnd many of my friends were ballet dancers.
p173
aVAgain, I don't know where inspiration comes from.
p174
aVI don't know where it comes from.
p175
aVI started making puppets when I was a kid.
p176
aVMaybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from, puppets, right.
p177
aVAnd then performing arts high school.
p178
aVThere I was in high school,
p179
aVmeeting dancers and acting.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd somehow, from there, I got interested in design.
p182
aVI went to Parsons School of Design
p183
aVand then I began my career as a designer.
p184
aVI don't really think of myself as a designer,
p185
aVI don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer.
p186
aVAnd frankly, I don't really know what to call myself.
p187
aVI think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as.
p188
aVIt's just that.
p189
aV(Laughter)
p190
aVBut I must say, this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time,
p191
aVthat is what \u2014 I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer.
p192
aVYou always have to be slightly bored with everything.
p193
aVAnd if you're not, you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VBut I am really a little bored with everything.
p197
aVI always say to my partner, Marisa Gardini, who books everything \u2014
p198
aVshe books everything and she makes everything happen.
p199
aVAnd she makes all the deals.
p200
aVAnd I always tell her that I find myself
p201
aVwith a lot of time on the computer bridge program.
p202
aVToo much time on computer bridge, which is, you know, like that's
p203
aVso ... somehow, like, about ten years ago
p204
aVI thought that the most unboring place in the world
p205
aVwould be like a T.V. studio,
p206
aVlike for a day show. Some kind of day talk show.
p207
aVBecause it's all of these things that I love
p208
aVall kind of in one place.
p209
aVAnd if you ever get bored you can look at another thing,
p210
aVand do another thing and talk about it, right?
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd so I had this T.V. show.
p213
aVAnd that was a very, very, very big part of my process.
p214
aVActually, could you roll the clip, please?
p215
aVThis is one of my favorite clips of Rosie.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Video) Isaac Mizrahi: We're back on the set.
p218
aVHi there.
p219
aa(lp220
VRosie O'Donnell: Hello, Ben.
p221
aa(lp222
VIM: Look how cute she looks with this, just a slick back.
p223
aa(lp224
VMan: Her grandmother says, "Delish!"
p225
aa(lp226
VIM: Ah, wow, delish. All right. So now where should I position myself?
p227
aVI want to stay out of the way.
p228
aVI don't want to be \u2014 okay. Here we go.
p229
aVDo you get nervous, Ashleigh?
p230
aa(lp231
VAshleigh: Doing what?
p232
aVROD: Cutting hair.
p233
aa(lp234
VA: Cutting hair? Never, never.
p235
aVI don't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous.
p236
aVIM: You look so cute already, by the way.
p237
aVROD: You like it? All right.
p238
aVIM: Do you have a problem with looking cute? You want to look cute.
p239
aa(lp240
VROD: Of course I want to look cute.
p241
aVIM: Just checking, because some people want to look, you know,
p242
aVaggressively ugly.
p243
aa(lp244
VROD: No, not me, no.
p245
aa(lp246
VIM: You read about all these people who have a lot of money
p247
aVand they have kids and the kids always end up somehow, like,
p248
aVreally messed up, you know what I mean?
p249
aVAnd there's got to be some way to do that, Rosie.
p250
aVBecause just because if you're fabulously rich, and fabulously famous,
p251
aVdoes that mean you shouldn't have kids,
p252
aVbecause you know they're going to end up getting messed up?
p253
aa(lp254
VROD: No, but it means that your priority has to be
p255
aVtheir well-being first, I think.
p256
aVBut you have to make the decision for yourself.
p257
aVMy kids are seven, who the hell knows.
p258
aVThey're going to be like 14 and in rehab.
p259
aVAnd they're going to be playing this clip:
p260
aV"I'm such a good mother."
p261
aVMy God, this is the shortest I've ever had.
p262
aa(lp263
VIM: It looks good, yeah?
p264
aa(lp265
VA: I was going to ask you, has your hair ever been \u2014
p266
aa(lp267
VROD: No! It's all right \u2014 go crazy.
p268
aa(lp269
VIM: I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here.
p270
aa(lp271
VA: Oh no, we're just staging,
p272
aa(lp273
VROD: We're just staging it.
p274
aa(lp275
VIM: Are you freaking out? You look so cute.
p276
aa(lp277
VROD: No, I love it. It's the new me.
p278
aa(lp279
VIM: Oh, it's so fabulous!
p280
aa(lp281
VROD: Flock of Rosie. Wooo!
p282
aa(lp283
VIM: So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world, right.
p284
aVI mean, like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that.
p285
aVThat is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring.
p286
aVActually, I read this great quote the other day, which was,
p287
aV"Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die."
p288
aVRight? And then I realized, that was on my website,
p289
aVand then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to me
p290
aVand I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.
p291
aVI forgot that I said that. But it's really true.
p292
aa(lp293
VI want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye.
p294
aVI'll tell you that I cook a lot also. I love to cook.
p295
aVAnd I often look at things as though they're food.
p296
aVLike I say, oh, you know, would you serve a rotten chicken?
p297
aVThen how could you serve, you know, a beat up old dress or something.
p298
aVHow could you show a beat up old dress?
p299
aVI always relate things to kitchen-ry.
p300
aVAnd so I think that's what it all boils down to.
p301
aVEverything boils down to that.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo check this out.
p304
aVThis is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world.
p305
aVIt's, like, this website.
p306
aVIt's got a lot of different things on it.
p307
aVIt's a polymathematical website.
p308
aVWe actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments.
p309
aVAnd it's kind of my favorite thing in the world.
p310
aVAnd it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows?
p311
aVAnd again, I don't say it's good, I just think it's not boring, right?
p312
aVAnd here is the last bit.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Video) IM: I have to tell you, I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time.
p315
aa(lp316
VChef: Do you?
p317
aa(lp318
VIM: Yeah, but I can never find buttermilk, ever.
p319
aa(lp320
VChef: Oh.
p321
aa(lp322
VIM: You can't find buttermilk at Citarella; you can't find buttermilk.
p323
aa(lp324
VChef: You can't?
p325
aVIM: It's always low-fat buttermilk.
p326
aa(lp327
VChef: No, but that's all it is.
p328
aVIM: Is that all it is?
p329
aa(lp330
VChef: Oh, you don't know? Let me tell you something.
p331
aVLet me tell you something interesting.
p332
aa(lp333
VIM: You know what? Stop laughing. It's not funny.
p334
aVJust because I don't know that whole \u2014 that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk.
p335
aVSorry, what?
p336
aa(lp337
VChef: Well, here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal.
p338
aVIn the old days when they used to make butter,
p339
aVyou know how you make butter?
p340
aa(lp341
VIM: Churns?
p342
aa(lp343
VChef: For cream?
p344
aa(lp345
VIM: Yeah, exactly.
p346
aa(lp347
VChef: So you take heavy, high-fat milk, which is cream,
p348
aVand you churn it until it separates into these curds and water.
p349
aVThe liquid is actually that clear liquid.
p350
aVIf you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream,
p351
aVit's actually buttermilk.
p352
aVAnd that's what it was in the early days.
p353
aVAnd that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things.
p354
aVNow, the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk.
p355
aa(lp356
VIM: Excuse me, I didn't know. All right?
p357
aa(lp358
VChef: The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious.
p359
aa(lp360
VIM: Yeah, it is, exactly.
p361
aVSo who would think that it was low-fat?
p362
aa(lp363
VWell, that's it. Thank you very much.
p364
aVHappy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it.
p365
aVThanks. Bye.

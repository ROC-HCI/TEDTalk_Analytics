VHuman beings start putting each other into boxes
p5
aVthe second that they see each other \u2014
p6
aVIs that person dangerous? Are they attractive?
p7
aVAre they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity?
p8
aVWe do this little interrogation when we meet people
p9
aVto make a mental resume for them.
p10
aVWhat's your name? Where are you from?
p11
aVHow old are you? What do you do?
p12
aVThen we get more personal with it.
p13
aVHave you ever had any diseases?
p14
aVHave you ever been divorced?
p15
aVDoes your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now?
p16
aVWhat are you into? Who are you into?
p17
aVWhat gender do you like to sleep with?
p18
aa(lp19
VI get it.
p20
aVWe are neurologically hardwired
p21
aVto seek out people like ourselves.
p22
aVWe start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough
p23
aVto know what acceptance feels like.
p24
aVWe bond together based on anything that we can \u2014
p25
aVmusic preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on.
p26
aVWe seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices.
p27
aVSometimes, though, just the question "what do you do?"
p28
aVcan feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box
p29
aVand asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it.
p30
aVBecause the categories, I've found, are too limiting.
p31
aVThe boxes are too narrow.
p32
aVAnd this can get really dangerous.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo here's a disclaimer about me, though,
p35
aVbefore we get too deep into this.
p36
aVI grew up in a very sheltered environment.
p37
aVI was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s,
p38
aVtwo blocks from the epicenter of punk music.
p39
aVI was shielded from the pains of bigotry
p40
aVand the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing.
p41
aVWhere I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker
p42
aVor a performance artist of some kind,
p43
aVyou were the weirdo.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVIt was an unorthodox upbringing,
p46
aVbut as a kid on the streets of New York,
p47
aVyou learn how to trust your own instincts,
p48
aVyou learn how to go with your own ideas.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy.
p51
aVI went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them.
p52
aVThey said they wouldn't let girls play.
p53
aVSo I went home, and I shaved my head,
p54
aVand I came back the next day and I said, "I'm a boy."
p55
aVI mean, who knows, right?
p56
aVWhen you're six, maybe you can do that.
p57
aVI didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't.
p58
aVI kept up the charade for eight years.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo this is me when I was 11.
p61
aVI was playing a kid named Walter
p62
aVin a movie called "Julian Po."
p63
aVI was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him.
p64
aVSee, I was also a child actor,
p65
aVwhich doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity,
p66
aVbecause no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy.
p67
aVIn fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl \u2014
p68
aVnot my teachers at school, not my friends,
p69
aVnot the directors that I worked with.
p70
aVKids would often come up to me in class
p71
aVand grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple
p72
aVor grab my crotch to check what I was working with.
p73
aVWhen I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls
p74
aVso that it looked like I was peeing standing up.
p75
aVAt sleepovers I would have panic attacks
p76
aVtrying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me
p77
aVwithout outing myself.
p78
aa(lp79
VIt's worth mentioning though
p80
aVthat I didn't hate my body or my genitalia.
p81
aVI didn't feel like I was in the wrong body.
p82
aVI felt like I was performing this elaborate act.
p83
aVI wouldn't have qualified as transgender.
p84
aVIf my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy,
p85
aVthey probably would have diagnosed me
p86
aVas something like gender dysmorphic
p87
aVand put me on hormones to stave off puberty.
p88
aVBut in my particular case,
p89
aVI just woke up one day when I was 14,
p90
aVand I decided that I wanted to be a girl again.
p91
aVPuberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant,
p92
aVand I was ready to figure out who I actually was.
p93
aa(lp94
VWhen a kid behaves like I did,
p95
aVthey don't exactly have to come out, right?
p96
aVNo one is exactly shocked.
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aVBut I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents.
p99
aVWhen I was 15, and I called my father
p100
aVto tell him that I had fallen in love,
p101
aVit was the last thing on either of our minds
p102
aVto discuss what the consequences were
p103
aVof the fact that my first love was a girl.
p104
aVThree years later, when I fell in love with a man,
p105
aVneither of my parents batted an eyelash either.
p106
aVSee, it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood
p107
aVthat I wasn't ever asked to define myself
p108
aVas any one thing at any point.
p109
aVI was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo four, almost five years ago,
p112
aVProposition 8, the great marriage equality debate,
p113
aVwas raising a lot of dust around this country.
p114
aVAnd at the time, getting married wasn't really something
p115
aVI spent a lot of time thinking about.
p116
aVBut I was struck by the fact that America,
p117
aVa country with such a tarnished civil rights record,
p118
aVcould be repeating its mistakes so blatantly.
p119
aVAnd I remember watching the discussion on television
p120
aVand thinking how interesting it was
p121
aVthat the separation of church and state
p122
aVwas essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country,
p123
aVbetween places where people believed in it
p124
aVand places where people didn't.
p125
aVAnd then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me.
p126
aa(lp127
VIf this was a war with two disparate sides,
p128
aVI, by default, fell on team gay,
p129
aVbecause I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight.
p130
aVAt the time I was just beginning to emerge
p131
aVfrom this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag
p132
aVthat saw me go from being a boy
p133
aVto being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes
p134
aVto the opposite extreme of this super skimpy,
p135
aVover-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl
p136
aVto finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was,
p137
aVa tomboyish girl
p138
aVwho liked both boys and girls depending on the person.
p139
aa(lp140
VI had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself,
p141
aVwho fell kind of between-the-lines \u2014
p142
aVgirls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear,
p143
aVgirls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish,
p144
aVgirls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees,
p145
aVgirls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls
p146
aVwho all hated being boxed in to anything.
p147
aVI loved these people, and I admired their freedom,
p148
aVbut I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble
p149
aVexploded into these raging debates
p150
aVwhere pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television.
p151
aVAnd this powerful awareness rolled in over me
p152
aVthat I was a minority, and in my own home country,
p153
aVbased on one facet of my character.
p154
aVI was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen.
p155
aa(lp156
VI was not an activist.
p157
aVI wave no flags in my own life.
p158
aVBut I was plagued by this question:
p159
aVHow could anyone vote to strip the rights
p160
aVof the vast variety of people that I knew
p161
aVbased on one element of their character?
p162
aVHow could they say that we as a group
p163
aVwere not deserving of equal rights as somebody else?
p164
aVWere we even a group? What group?
p165
aVAnd had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination?
p166
aVDid they know who they were voting against and what the impact was?
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd then it occurred to me,
p169
aVperhaps if they could look into the eyes
p170
aVof the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship
p171
aVit might make it harder for them to do.
p172
aVIt might give them pause.
p173
aVObviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party,
p174
aVso I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically
p175
aVwithout any artifice, without any lighting,
p176
aVor without any manipulation of any kind on my part.
p177
aVBecause in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers
p178
aVwithout the fear of him ripping your face off.
p179
aa(lp180
VFor me, photography is not just about exposing film,
p181
aVit's about exposing the viewer
p182
aVto something new, a place they haven't gone before,
p183
aVbut most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of.
p184
aVLife magazine introduced generations of people
p185
aVto distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures.
p186
aVSo I decided to make a series of very simple portraits,
p187
aVmugshots if you will.
p188
aVAnd I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country
p189
aVthat was not 100 percent straight,
p190
aVwhich, if you don't know, is a limitless number of people.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VSo this was a very large undertaking,
p195
aVand to do it we needed some help.
p196
aVSo I ran out in the freezing cold,
p197
aVand I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to
p198
aVin February of about two years ago.
p199
aVAnd I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help.
p200
aVAnd they funded two weeks of shooting in New York.
p201
aVAnd then we made this.
p202

p206
aV(Music)
p207
aa(lp208
VSelf Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today.
p209
aVMy aim is to take a simple portrait
p210
aVof anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight
p211
aVor feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way.
p212
aVMy goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us
p213
aVthrough the simplicity of a face.
p214
aV(Music)
p215
aa(lp216
V"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."
p217
aVIt's written in the Declaration of Independence.
p218
aVWe are failing as a nation
p219
aVto uphold the morals upon which we were founded.
p220
aVThere is no equality in the United States.
p221
aa(lp222
V["What does equality mean to you?"]
p223
aV["Marriage"] ["Freedom"] ["Civil rights"]
p224
aV["Treat every person as you'd treat yourself"]
p225
aa(lp226
VIt's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that.
p227
aVThe fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage.
p228
aVToday in 29 states, more than half of this country,
p229
aVyou can legally be fired just for your sexuality.
p230
aa(lp231
V["Who is responsible for equality?"]
p232
aa(lp233
VI've heard hundreds of people give the same answer:
p234
aV"We are all responsible for equality."
p235
aVSo far we've shot 300 faces in New York City.
p236
aVAnd we wouldn't have been able to do any of it
p237
aVwithout the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign.
p238
aVI want to take the project across the country.
p239
aVI want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people.
p240
aVThis is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation.
p241
aVI challenge you to look into the faces of these people
p242
aVand tell them that they deserve less than any other human being.
p243
aV(Music)
p244
aa(lp245
V["Self evident truths"]
p246
aV["4,000 faces across America"]
p247
aa(lp248
V(Music)
p249
aV(Applause)
p250
aa(lp251
ViO Tillett Wright: Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that.
p252
aVAlmost 85,000 people watched that video,
p253
aVand then they started emailing us from all over the country,
p254
aVasking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces.
p255
aVAnd a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated.
p256
aVSo I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces.
p257
aVThat video was made in the spring of 2011,
p258
aVand as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities
p259
aVand photographed almost 2,000 people.
p260
aa(lp261
VI know that this is a talk,
p262
aVbut I'd like to have a minute of just quiet
p263
aVand have you just look at these faces
p264
aVbecause there is nothing that I can say that will add to them.
p265
aVBecause if a picture is worth a thousand words,
p266
aVthen a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo after traveling and talking to people
p269
aVin places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas,
p270
aVwe found evidence that the initial premise was dead on.
p271
aVVisibility really is key.
p272
aVFamiliarity really is the gateway drug to empathy.
p273
aVOnce an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family,
p274
aVyou're far more likely to explore sympathy for it
p275
aVor explore a new perspective on it.
p276
aVOf course, in my travels I met people
p277
aVwho legally divorced their children for being other than straight,
p278
aVbut I also met people who were Southern Baptists
p279
aVwho switched churches because their child was a lesbian.
p280
aVSparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths.
p281
aa(lp282
VBut here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting:
p283
aVSelf Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us.
p284
aVIn fact, on the contrary, it highlights them.
p285
aVIt presents, not just the complexities
p286
aVfound in a procession of different human beings,
p287
aVbut the complexities found within each individual person.
p288
aVIt wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few.
p289
aa(lp290
VAt some point I realized that my mission to photograph "gays" was inherently flawed,
p291
aVbecause there were a million different shades of gay.
p292
aVHere I was trying to help,
p293
aVand I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid \u2014
p294
aVyet another box.
p295
aVAt some point I added a question to the release form
p296
aVthat asked people to quantify themselves
p297
aVon a scale of one to 100 percent gay.
p298
aVAnd I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me.
p299
aV(Laughter)
p300
aVPeople didn't know what to do
p301
aVbecause they had never been presented with the option before.
p302
aVCan you quantify your openness?
p303
aa(lp304
VOnce they got over the shock, though,
p305
aVby and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent
p306
aVor the 3 to 20 percent marks.
p307
aVOf course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other,
p308
aVbut I found that a much larger proportion of people
p309
aVidentified as something that was much more nuanced.
p310
aVI found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as "Grey."
p311
aa(lp312
VLet me be clear though \u2014 and this is very important \u2014
p313
aVin no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist.
p314
aVAnd I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative,
p315
aVbecause if any of you happen to be of the belief
p316
aVthat sexual orientation is a choice,
p317
aVI invite you to go out and try to be grey.
p318
aVI'll take your picture just for trying.
p319
aV(Laughter)
p320
aVWhat I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional.
p321
aVThe most important thing to take from the percentage system is this:
p322
aVIf you have gay people over here
p323
aVand you have straight people over here,
p324
aVand while we recognize that most people identify
p325
aVas somewhere closer to one binary or another,
p326
aVthere is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd the reality that this presents is a complicated one.
p329
aVBecause, for example, if you pass a law
p330
aVthat allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior,
p331
aVwhere exactly do you draw the line?
p332
aVIs it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far?
p333
aVOr is it over here
p334
aVby the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far?
p335
aVWhere exactly does one become a second-class citizen?
p336
aa(lp337
VAnother interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels
p338
aVis just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is.
p339
aVAfter traveling so much and meeting so many people,
p340
aVlet me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts
p341
aVand Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens
p342
aVand every other polarization you can possibly think of
p343
aVwithin the LGBT community
p344
aVas there are within the human race.
p345
aVAside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs,
p346
aVand once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle,
p347
aVjust being other than straight
p348
aVdoesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming,
p351
aVas it hopefully appears across more and more platforms,
p352
aVbus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers,
p353
aVperhaps in watching this procession of humanity,
p354
aVsomething interesting and useful will begin to happen.
p355
aVHopefully these categories, these binaries,
p356
aVthese over-simplified boxes
p357
aVwill begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away.
p358
aVBecause really, they describe nothing that we see
p359
aVand no one that we know and nothing that we are.
p360
aVWhat we see are human beings in all their multiplicity.
p361
aVAnd seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity.
p362
aVAt the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights.
p363
aa(lp364
VSo is it me particularly
p365
aVthat you would choose to deny the right to housing,
p366
aVthe right to adopt children, the right to marriage,
p367
aVthe freedom to shop here, live here, buy here?
p368
aVAm I the one that you choose to disown
p369
aVas your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father,
p370
aVyour neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president,
p371
aVyour police woman or the fireman?
p372
aVIt's too late.
p373
aVBecause I already am all of those things.
p374
aVWe already are all of those things, and we always have been.
p375
aVSo please don't greet us as strangers,
p376
aVgreet us as your fellow human beings, period.
p377
aa(lp378
VThank you.
p379

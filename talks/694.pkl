VAs technology progresses,
p5
aVand as it advances,
p6
aVmany of us assume that these advances
p7
aVmake us more intelligent,
p8
aVmake us smarter and more connected to the world.
p9
aVAnd what I'd like to argue
p10
aVis that that's not necessarily the case,
p11
aVas progress is simply a word for change,
p12
aVand with change you gain something,
p13
aVbut you also lose something.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do
p16
aVis to show you how technology has dealt with
p17
aVa very simple, a very common, an everyday question.
p18
aVAnd that question is this.
p19
aVWhat time is it? What time is it?
p20
aVIf you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.
p21
aVBut, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time
p22
aVif you didn't have an iPhone?
p23
aVHow would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?
p24
aVHow would you do it?
p25
aa(lp26
VWell, the way you would do it is by using a device
p27
aVthat's called an astrolabe.
p28
aVSo, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.
p29
aVBut, at the time, in the 13th century,
p30
aVit was the gadget of the day.
p31
aVIt was the world's first popular computer.
p32
aVAnd it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.
p33
aVSo, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type,
p34
aVthe rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.
p35
aVThe plate corresponds to a coordinate system.
p36
aVAnd the mater has some scales and puts it all together.
p37
aa(lp38
VIf you were an educated child,
p39
aVyou would know how to not only use the astrolabe,
p40
aVyou would also know how to make an astrolabe.
p41
aVAnd we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe,
p42
aVthe first technical manual in the English language,
p43
aVwas written by Geoffrey Chaucer.
p44
aVYes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391,
p45
aVto his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.
p46
aVAnd in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd the central idea that makes this computer work
p49
aVis this thing called stereographic projection.
p50
aVAnd basically, the concept is,
p51
aVhow do you represent the three-dimensional image
p52
aVof the night sky that surrounds us
p53
aVonto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.
p54
aVThe idea is actually relatively simple.
p55
aVImagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe,
p56
aVand surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.
p57
aVEach point on the surface of the sphere
p58
aVis mapped through the bottom pole,
p59
aVonto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo the North Star corresponds to the center of the device.
p62
aVThe ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets
p63
aVcorrespond to an offset circle.
p64
aVThe bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.
p65
aVAnd the altitude corresponds to the plate system.
p66
aVNow, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.
p67
aVThe real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems
p68
aVso they fit perfectly.
p69
aVThere is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.
p70
aVAnd then there is their location on the sky
p71
aVas seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay?
p72
aa(lp73
VSo how would you use this device?
p74
aVWell, let me first back up for a moment.
p75
aVThis is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it?
p76
aVAnd so, this astrolabe is on loan from us
p77
aVfrom the Oxford School of \u2014 Museum of History.
p78
aVAnd you can see the different components.
p79
aVThis is the mater, the scales on the back.
p80
aVThis is the rete. Okay. Do you see that?
p81
aVThat's the movable part of the sky.
p82
aVAnd in the back you can see
p83
aVa spider web pattern.
p84
aVAnd that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.
p85
aVThis is a rule device. And on the back
p86
aVare some other devices, measuring tools
p87
aVand scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay?
p88
aa(lp89
VYou know, I've always wanted one of these.
p90
aVFor my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.
p91
aVAnd this one, this is a replica
p92
aVfrom a 15th-century device.
p93
aVAnd it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.
p94
aVBut a real one would cost about as much as my house,
p95
aVand the house next to it, and actually every house on the block,
p96
aVon both sides of the street,
p97
aVmaybe a school thrown in, and some \u2014 you know, a church.
p98
aVThey are just incredibly expensive.
p99
aa(lp100
VBut let me show you how to work this device.
p101
aVSo let's go to step one.
p102
aVFirst thing that you do is you select a star
p103
aVin the night sky, if you're telling time at night.
p104
aVSo, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.
p105
aVAnd there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb.
p106
aVSecond, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.
p107
aVSo, step two, I hold the device up,
p108
aVand then I sight its altitude there
p109
aVso I can see it clearly now.
p110
aVAnd then I measure its altitude.
p111
aVSo, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there.
p112
aVStep three is identify the star on the front of the device.
p113
aVDeneb is there. I can tell.
p114
aVStep four is I then move the rete,
p115
aVmove the sky, so the altitude of the star
p116
aVcorresponds to the scale on the back.
p117
aVOkay, so when that happens
p118
aVeverything lines up.
p119
aVI have here a model of the sky
p120
aVthat corresponds to the real sky. Okay?
p121
aVSo, it is, in a sense,
p122
aVholding a model of the universe in my hands.
p123
aVAnd then finally, I take a rule,
p124
aVand move the rule to a date line
p125
aVwhich then tells me the time here.
p126
aVRight. So, that's how the device is used.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, I know what you're thinking:
p130
aV"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?"
p131
aVas you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.
p132
aVBut there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod
p133
aVyou can tell \u2014 or your iPhone, you can tell exactly
p134
aVwhat the time is, with precision.
p135
aVThe way little Lewis would tell the time
p136
aVis by a picture of the sky.
p137
aVHe would know where things would fit in the sky.
p138
aVHe would not only know what time it was,
p139
aVhe would also know where the sun would rise,
p140
aVand how it would move across the sky.
p141
aVHe would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.
p142
aVAnd he would know that for essentially every celestial object
p143
aVin the heavens.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo, in computer graphics
p146
aVand computer user interface design,
p147
aVthere is a term called affordances.
p148
aVSo, affordances are the qualities of an object
p149
aVthat allow us to perform an action with it.
p150
aVAnd what the astrolabe does is it allows us,
p151
aVit affords us, to connect to the night sky,
p152
aVto look up into the night sky and be much more \u2014
p153
aVto see the visible and the invisible together.
p154
aVSo, that's just one use. Incredible,
p155
aVthere is probably 350, 400 uses.
p156
aVIn fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses
p157
aVof this first computer.
p158
aa(lp159
VOn the back there is scales and measurements
p160
aVfor terrestrial navigation.
p161
aVYou can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it.
p162
aVIt can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.
p163
aVAnd it would take a full university course to illustrate it.
p164
aVAstrolabes have an incredible history.
p165
aVThey are over 2,000 years old.
p166
aVThe concept of stereographic projection
p167
aVoriginated in 330 B.C.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd the astrolabes come in many different
p170
aVsizes and shapes and forms.
p171
aVThere is portable ones. There is large display ones.
p172
aVAnd I think what is common to all astrolabes
p173
aVis that they are beautiful works of art.
p174
aVThere is a quality of craftsmanship and precision
p175
aVthat is just astonishing and remarkable.
p176
aa(lp177
VAstrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.
p178
aVSo, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.
p179
aVAnd advancing retes became cultural emblems.
p180
aVThis is one from Oxford.
p181
aVAnd I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern
p182
aVis completely symmetrical,
p183
aVand it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.
p184
aVHow cool is that? This is just amazing.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?
p187
aVProbably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood,
p188
aVor paper. And the vast majority of this first computer
p189
aVwas a portable device
p190
aVthat you could keep in the back of your pocket.
p191
aVSo, what does the astrolabe inspire?
p192
aVWell, I think the first thing is that
p193
aVit reminds us just how resourceful people were,
p194
aVour forebears were, years and years ago.
p195
aVIt's just an incredible device.
p196
aa(lp197
VEvery technology advances.
p198
aVEvery technology is transformed and moved by others.
p199
aVAnd what we gain with a new technology, of course,
p200
aVis precision and accuracy.
p201
aVBut what we lose, I think, is
p202
aVan accurate \u2014 a felt sense
p203
aVof the sky, a sense of context.
p204
aVKnowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky,
p205
aVis the center of the real answer
p206
aVto knowing what time it is.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo, it's \u2014 I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.
p209
aVAnd so, what can you learn from these devices?
p210
aVWell, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge
p211
aVthat we can connect with the world.
p212
aVAnd astrolabes return us to this subtle sense
p213
aVof how things all fit together,
p214
aVand also how we connect to the world.
p215
aVThanks very much.
p216
aV(Applause)

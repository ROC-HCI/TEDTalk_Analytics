VPeople back home call me a heckler,
p5
aVa troublemaker, an irritant,
p6
aVa rebel, an activist,
p7
aVthe voice of the people.
p8
aVBut that wasn't always me.
p9
aa(lp10
VGrowing up, I had a nickname.
p11
aVThey used to call me Softy,
p12
aVmeaning the soft, harmless boy.
p13
aVLike every other human being, I avoided trouble.
p14
aVIn my childhood, they taught me silence.
p15
aVDon't argue, do as you're told.
p16
aVIn Sunday school, they taught me don't confront, don't argue,
p17
aVeven if you're right, turn the other cheek.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis was reinforced by the political climate of the time.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVKenya is a country where you are guilty
p22
aVuntil proven rich.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVKenya's poor are five times more likely
p25
aVto be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them
p26
aVthan by criminals.
p27
aVThis was reinforced by the political climate of the day.
p28
aVWe had a president, Moi, who was a dictator.
p29
aVHe ruled the country with an iron fist,
p30
aVand anyone who dared question his authority
p31
aVwas arrested, tortured, jailed or even killed.
p32
aVThat meant that people were taught to be smart cowards, stay out of trouble.
p33
aVBeing a coward was not an insult.
p34
aVBeing a coward was a compliment.
p35
aVWe used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother.
p36
aVWhat that meant: that if you stayed out of trouble you're going to stay alive.
p37
aa(lp38
VI used to question this advice,
p39
aVand eight years ago we had an election in Kenya,
p40
aVand the results were violently disputed.
p41
aVWhat followed that election was terrible violence, rape,
p42
aVand the killing of over 1,000 people.
p43
aVMy work was to document the violence.
p44
aVAs a photographer, I took thousands of images,
p45
aVand after two months,
p46
aVthe two politicians came together, had a cup of tea,
p47
aVsigned a peace agreement, and the country moved on.
p48
aa(lp49
VI was a very disturbed man because I saw the violence firsthand.
p50
aVI saw the killings. I saw the displacement.
p51
aVI met women who had been raped, and it disturbed me,
p52
aVbut the country never spoke about it.
p53
aVWe pretended. We all became smart cowards.
p54
aVWe decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about it.
p55
aa(lp56
VTen months later, I quit my job. I said I could not stand it anymore.
p57
aVAfter quitting my job, I decided to organize my friends
p58
aVto speak about the violence in the country,
p59
aVto speak about the state of the nation,
p60
aVand June 1, 2009 was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium
p61
aVand try and get the president's attention.
p62
aVIt's a national holiday,
p63
aVit's broadcast across the country,
p64
aVand I showed up at the stadium.
p65
aVMy friends did not show up.
p66
aVI found myself alone,
p67
aVand I didn't know what to do.
p68
aVI was scared,
p69
aVbut I knew very well that that particular day,
p70
aVI had to make a decision.
p71
aVWas I able to live as a coward, like everyone else,
p72
aVor was I going to make a stand?
p73
aVAnd when the president stood up to speak,
p74
aVI found myself on my feet shouting at the president,
p75
aVtelling him to remember the post-election violence victims,
p76
aVto stop the corruption.
p77
aVAnd suddenly, out of nowhere,
p78
aVthe police pounced on me like hungry lions.
p79
aVThey held my mouth
p80
aVand dragged me out of the stadium,
p81
aVwhere they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail.
p82
aVI spent that night in a cold cement floor in the jail,
p83
aVand that got me thinking.
p84
aVWhat was making me feel this way?
p85
aVMy friends and family thought I was crazy because of what I did,
p86
aVand the images that I took were disturbing my life.
p87
aVThe images that I took were just a number to many Kenyans.
p88
aVMost Kenyans did not see the violence.
p89
aVIt was a story to them.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd so I decided to actually start a street exhibition
p92
aVto show the images of the violence across the country
p93
aVand get people talking about it.
p94
aVWe traveled the country and showed the images,
p95
aVand this was a journey that has started me to the activist path,
p96
aVwhere I decided to become silent no more,
p97
aVto talk about those things.
p98
aVWe traveled, and our general site from our street exhibit
p99
aVbecame for political graffiti about the situation in the country,
p100
aVtalking about corruption, bad leadership.
p101
aVWe have even done symbolic burials.
p102
aVWe have delivered live pigs to Kenya's parliament
p103
aVas a symbol of our politicians' greed.
p104
aVIt has been done in Uganda and other countries,
p105
aVand what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media
p106
aVand amplified across the country, across the continent.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhere I used to stand up alone seven years ago,
p109
aVnow I belong to a community of many people who stand up with me.
p110
aVI am no longer alone when I stand up to speak about these things.
p111
aVI belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country,
p112
aVwho want to bring about change,
p113
aVand they're no longer afraid, and they're no longer smart cowards.
p114
aVSo that was my story.
p115
aVThat day in the stadium,
p116
aVI stood up as a smart coward.
p117
aVBy that one action, I said goodbye to the 24 years living as a coward.
p118
aa(lp119
VThere are two most powerful days in your life:
p120
aVthe day you're born, and the day you discover why.
p121
aVThat day standing up in that stadium shouting at the President,
p122
aVI discovered why I was truly born,
p123
aVthat I would no longer be silent in the face of injustice.
p124
aVDo you know why you were born?
p125
aVThank you.
p126
aV(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VTom Rielly: It's an amazing story.
p129
aVI just want to ask you a couple quick questions.
p130
aVSo PAWA254:
p131
aVyou've created a studio, a place where young people can go
p132
aVand harness the power of digital media
p133
aVto do some of this action.
p134
aVWhat's happening now with PAWA?
p135
aa(lp136
VBoniface Mwangi: So we have  this community of filmmakers,
p137
aVgraffiti artists, musicians, and when there's an issue in the country,
p138
aVwe come together, we brainstorm, and take up on that issue.
p139
aVSo our most powerful tool is art,
p140
aVbecause we live in a very busy world where people are so busy in their life,
p141
aVand they don't have time to read.
p142
aVSo we package our activism and we package our message in art.
p143
aVSo from the music, the graffiti,  the art, that's what we do.
p144
aVCan I say one more thing?
p145
aa(lp146
VTR: Yeah, of course. (Applause)
p147
aa(lp148
VBM: In spite of being arrested, beaten up, threatened,
p149
aVthe moment I discovered my voice,
p150
aVthat I could actually stand up for what I really believed in,
p151
aVI'm no longer afraid.
p152
aVI used to be called softy, but I'm no longer softy,
p153
aVbecause I discovered who I really am, as in, that's what I want to do,
p154
aVand there's such beauty in doing that.
p155
aVThere's nothing as powerful as that, knowing that I'm meant to do this,
p156
aVbecause you don't get scared, you just continue living your life.
p157
aa(lp158
VThank you.

Mwangi became the eye of Kenyans during the 2007 post-election violence and showed courage and compassion to capture thousands of images, some so gory that they could not be published.<br /><br />Following the political resolution to the election crisis, Boniface started to see himself as a visual artist, using photography as the vehicle for social change in Kenya. His focus was the fight against the impunity of politicians in the face of over 1000 dead and half a million people displaced as a result of the violence they caused.<br /><br />&quot;Boniface&rsquo;s images are crucial for the healing of our nation; his ability to stay focused and inject a sense of artistry into his work is a testimony to the spirit of professional journalism,&quot; wrote Jackson Biko after Boniface was voted Kenya Photojournalist of the Year in 2008 by readers of <em>Adam</em>, a men&rsquo;s magazine in the country.<br /><br />Since then, Boniface has continued to work as a freelance photographer for Bloomberg, the AFP, Reuters, the Boston Globe, and other media outlets while building a movement for social change in Kenya through &ldquo;Picha Mtaani&rdquo; (Swahili for street exhibition). The photo exhibit aims to heal the scars of Kenyans and draw their attention to the dynamics of the violence to prevent a repeat during the upcoming elections of 2013.<br /><br />Boniface founded Pawa254 as a collaborative hub where journalists, artists and activists could meet to find innovative ways of achieving social change. The hub has already had many functions, but two campaigns stand out. &ldquo;Heal the Nation&rdquo; is a very successful initiative to show a half-hour documentary about post-election violence to as many Kenyans as possible and facilitate discussions around the film. The campaign is accompanied by a more shadowy graffiti campaign that has evoked strong reactions and fired up the youth of Kenya and the world, as images of the clever graffiti grace the pages of the world&rsquo;s newspapers.<br /><br />In 2009 United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote a letter commending Boniface for his work during the post-election violence. She stated, &quot;Your photography is absolutely stunning and tells an important and powerful story for the world to hear.&quot;", "slug": "boniface_mwangi", "whotheyare": "Boniface Mwangi is an award-winning Kenyan photographer, artist and activist.

photography position at The Standard, the second largest Kenyan newspaper, taking on various assignments of increasing responsibility in a number of countries. Mwangi became the eye of Kenyans during the 2007 post-election violence and showed courage and compassion to capture thousands of images, some so gory that they could not be published.<br /><br />Following the political resolution to the election crisis, Boniface started to see himself as a visual artist, using photography as the vehicle for social change in Kenya. His focus was the fight against the impunity of politicians in the face of over 1000 dead and half a million people displaced as a result of the violence they caused.<br /><br />&quot;Boniface&rsquo;s images are crucial for the healing of our nation; his ability to stay focused and inject a sense of artistry into his work is a testimony to the spirit of professional journalism,&quot; wrote Jackson Biko after Boniface was voted Kenya Photojournalist of the Year in 2008 by readers of <em>Adam</em>, a men&rsquo;s magazine in the country.<br /><br />Since then, Boniface has continued to work as a freelance photographer for Bloomberg, the AFP, Reuters, the Boston Globe, and other media outlets while building a movement for social change in Kenya through &ldquo;Picha Mtaani&rdquo; (Swahili for street exhibition). The photo exhibit aims to heal the scars of Kenyans and draw their attention to the dynamics of the violence to prevent a repeat during the upcoming elections of 2013.<br /><br />Boniface founded Pawa254 as a collaborative hub where journalists, artists and activists could meet to find innovative ways of achieving social change. The hub has already had many functions, but two campaigns stand out. &ldquo;Heal the Nation&rdquo; is a very successful initiative to show a half-hour documentary about post-election violence to as many Kenyans as possible and facilitate discussions around the film. The campaign is accompanied by a more shadowy graffiti campaign that has evoked strong reactions and fired up the youth of Kenya and the world, as images of the clever graffiti grace the pages of the world&rsquo;s newspapers.<br /><br />In 2009 United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote a letter commending Boniface for his work during the post-election violence. She stated, &quot;Your photography is absolutely stunning and tells an important and powerful story for the world to hear.&quot;", "slug": "boniface_mwangi", "whotheyare": "Boniface Mwangi is an award-winning Kenyan photographer, artist and activist.

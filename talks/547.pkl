VBelieve me or not, I come offering a solution
p5
aVto a very important part of this larger problem,
p6
aVwith the requisite focus on climate.
p7
aVAnd the solution I offer
p8
aVis to the biggest culprit
p9
aVin this massive mistreatment of the earth
p10
aVby humankind,
p11
aVand the resulting decline of the biosphere.
p12
aVThat culprit is business and industry,
p13
aVwhich happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years
p14
aVsince my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956.
p15
aVAs an industrial engineer,
p16
aVcum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur.
p17
aVAfter founding my company, Interface, from scratch
p18
aVin 1973, 36 years ago,
p19
aVto produce carpet tiles in America
p20
aVfor the business and institution markets,
p21
aVand shepherding it through start-up and survival
p22
aVto prosperity and global dominance in its field,
p23
aVI read Paul Hawken's book,
p24
aV"The Ecology of Commerce,"
p25
aVthe summer of 1994.
p26
aVIn his book, Paul charges business and industry
p27
aVas, one, the major culprit
p28
aVin causing the decline of the biosphere,
p29
aVand, two, the only institution that is large enough,
p30
aVand pervasive enough, and powerful enough,
p31
aVto really lead humankind out of this mess.
p32
aVAnd by the way he convicted me
p33
aVas a plunderer of the earth.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd I then challenged the people of Interface, my company,
p36
aVto lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability,
p37
aVwhich we defined as eventually operating
p38
aVour petroleum-intensive company in such a way
p39
aVas to take from the earth
p40
aVonly what can be renewed by the earth, naturally and rapidly \u2014
p41
aVnot another fresh drop of oil \u2014
p42
aVand to do no harm to the biosphere.
p43
aVTake nothing: do no harm.
p44
aVI simply said, "If Hawken is right
p45
aVand business and industry must lead,
p46
aVwho will lead business and industry?
p47
aVUnless somebody leads, nobody will."
p48
aVIt's axiomatic. Why not us?
p49
aVAnd thanks to the people of Interface,
p50
aVI have become a recovering plunderer.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
V(Applause)
p55
aa(lp56
VI once told a Fortune Magazine writer
p57
aVthat someday people like me would go to jail.
p58
aVAnd that became the headline of a Fortune article.
p59
aVThey went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO.
p60
aVFrom plunderer to recovering plunderer,
p61
aVto America's greenest CEO in five years \u2014
p62
aVthat, frankly, was a pretty sad commentary
p63
aVon American CEOs in 1999.
p64
aVAsked later in the Canadian documentary, "The Corporation,"
p65
aVwhat I meant by the "go to jail" remark,
p66
aVI offered that theft is a crime.
p67
aVAnd theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.
p68
aVBut I realized, for that to be true \u2014
p69
aVfor theft of our children's future to be a crime \u2014
p70
aVthere must be a clear, demonstrable alternative
p71
aVto the take-make-waste industrial system
p72
aVthat so dominates our civilization,
p73
aVand is the major culprit, stealing our children's future,
p74
aVby digging up the earth
p75
aVand converting it to products that quickly become waste
p76
aVin a landfill or an incinerator \u2014
p77
aVin short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution.
p78
aa(lp79
VAccording to Paul and Anne Ehrlich
p80
aVand a well-known environmental impact equation,
p81
aVimpact \u2014 a bad thing \u2014
p82
aVis the product of population, affluence and technology.
p83
aVThat is, impact is generated by people,
p84
aVwhat they consume in their affluence,
p85
aVand how it is produced.
p86
aVAnd though the equation is largely subjective,
p87
aVyou can perhaps quantify people, and perhaps quantify affluence,
p88
aVbut technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify.
p89
aVSo the equation is conceptual.
p90
aVStill it works to help us understand the problem.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo we set out at Interface, in 1994,
p93
aVto create an example:
p94
aVto transform the way we made carpet,
p95
aVa petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy,
p96
aVand to transform our technologies
p97
aVso they diminished environmental impact,
p98
aVrather than multiplied it.
p99
aVPaul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation:
p100
aVI is equal to P times A times T:
p101
aVpopulation, affluence and technology.
p102
aVI wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read
p103
aVI equals P times A divided by T.
p104
aVNow, the mathematically-minded will see immediately
p105
aVthat T in the numerator increases impact \u2014 a bad thing \u2014
p106
aVbut T in the denominator decreases impact.
p107
aVSo I ask, "What would move T, technology,
p108
aVfrom the numerator \u2014 call it T1 \u2014
p109
aVwhere it increases impact,
p110
aVto the denominator \u2014 call it T2 \u2014
p111
aVwhere it reduces impact?
p112
aa(lp113
VI thought about the characteristics
p114
aVof first industrial revolution,
p115
aVT1, as we practiced it at Interface,
p116
aVand it had the following characteristics.
p117
aVExtractive: taking raw materials from the earth.
p118
aVLinear: take, make, waste.
p119
aVPowered by fossil fuel-derived energy.
p120
aVWasteful: abusive and focused on labor productivity.
p121
aVMore carpet per man-hour.
p122
aVThinking it through, I realized that all those attributes
p123
aVmust be changed to move T to the denominator.
p124
aVIn the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable;
p125
aVlinear by cyclical;
p126
aVfossil fuel energy by renewable energy, sunlight;
p127
aVwasteful by waste-free;
p128
aVand abusive by benign;
p129
aVand labor productivity by resource productivity.
p130
aVAnd I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes,
p131
aVand get rid of T1 altogether,
p132
aVwe could reduce our impact to zero,
p133
aVincluding our impact on the climate.
p134
aVAnd that became the Interface plan in 1995,
p135
aVand has been the plan ever since.
p136
aa(lp137
VWe have measured our progress very rigorously.
p138
aVSo I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years.
p139
aVNet greenhouse gas emissions
p140
aVdown 82 percent in absolute tonnage.
p141
aV(Applause)
p142
aVOver the same span of time
p143
aVsales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled.
p144
aVSo an 82 percent absolute reduction
p145
aVtranslates into a 90 percent reduction
p146
aVin greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales.
p147
aVThis is the magnitude
p148
aVof the reduction the entire global technosphere
p149
aVmust realize by 2050
p150
aVto avoid catastrophic climate disruption \u2014
p151
aVso the scientists are telling us.
p152
aVFossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production,
p153
aVdue to efficiencies in renewables.
p154
aVThe cheapest, most secure barrel of oil there is
p155
aVis the one not used through efficiencies.
p156
aVWater usage is down 75 percent
p157
aVin our worldwide carpet tile business.
p158
aVDown 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business,
p159
aVwhich we acquired in 1993
p160
aVright here in California, City of Industry,
p161
aVwhere water is so precious.
p162
aVRenewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total, and growing rapidly.
p163
aVRenewable energy is 27 percent of our total,
p164
aVgoing for 100 percent.
p165
aVWe have diverted 148 million pounds \u2014
p166
aVthat's 74,000 tons \u2014
p167
aVof used carpet from landfills,
p168
aVclosing the loop on material flows
p169
aVthrough reverse logistics
p170
aVand post-consumer recycling technologies
p171
aVthat did not exist when we started 14 years ago.
p172
aa(lp173
VThose new cyclical technologies
p174
aVhave contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold
p175
aV85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet
p176
aVsince 2004,
p177
aVmeaning no net contribution to global climate disruption
p178
aVin producing the carpet throughout the supply chain,
p179
aVfrom mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation \u2014
p180
aVindependent third-party certified.
p181
aVWe call it Cool Carpet.
p182
aVAnd it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator,
p183
aVincreasing sales and profits.
p184
aVThree years ago we launched carpet tile for the home,
p185
aVunder the brand Flor,
p186
aVmisspelled F-L-O-R.
p187
aVYou can point and click today at Flor.com
p188
aVand have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days.
p189
aVIt is practical, and pretty too.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VWe reckon that we are a bit over halfway
p196
aVto our goal: zero impact, zero footprint.
p197
aVWe've set 2020 as our target year for zero,
p198
aVfor reaching the top, the summit of Mount Sustainability.
p199
aVWe call this Mission Zero.
p200
aVAnd this is perhaps the most important facet:
p201
aVwe have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business.
p202
aVA better business model,
p203
aVa better way to bigger profits.
p204
aVHere is the business case for sustainability.
p205
aVFrom real life experience, costs are down, not up,
p206
aVreflecting some 400 million dollars
p207
aVof avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste \u2014
p208
aVthe first face of Mount Sustainability.
p209
aVThis has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd this dispels a myth too,
p212
aVthis false choice between the environment and the economy.
p213
aVOur products are the best they've ever been,
p214
aVinspired by design for sustainability,
p215
aVan unexpected wellspring of innovation.
p216
aVOur people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose.
p217
aVYou cannot beat it for attracting the best people
p218
aVand bringing them together.
p219
aVAnd the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing.
p220
aVNo amount of advertising, no clever marketing campaign,
p221
aVat any price, could have produced or created
p222
aVthis much goodwill.
p223
aVCosts, products, people, marketplaces \u2014
p224
aVwhat else is there?
p225
aVIt is a better business model.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd here is our 14-year record of sales and profits.
p228
aVThere is a dip there, from 2001 to 2003:
p229
aVa dip when our sales, over a three-year period,
p230
aVwere down 17 percent.
p231
aVBut the marketplace was down 36 percent.
p232
aVWe literally gained market share.
p233
aVWe might not have survived that recession
p234
aVbut for the advantages of sustainability.
p235
aVIf every business were pursuing Interface plans,
p236
aVwould that solve all our problems?
p237
aVI don't think so.
p238
aVI remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation,
p239
aVI equals P times A divided by T2.
p240
aVThat A is a capital A,
p241
aVsuggesting that affluence is an end in itself.
p242
aVBut what if we reframed Ehrlich further?
p243
aVAnd what if we made A a lowercase 'a,'
p244
aVsuggesting that it is a means to an end,
p245
aVand that end is happiness \u2014
p246
aVmore happiness with less stuff.
p247
aa(lp248
VYou know that would reframe civilization itself \u2014
p249
aV(Applause) \u2014
p250
aVand our whole system of economics,
p251
aVif not for our species, then perhaps for the one that succeeds us:
p252
aVthe sustainable species, living on a finite earth,
p253
aVethically, happily and ecologically
p254
aVin balance with nature
p255
aVand all her natural systems for a thousand generations,
p256
aVor 10,000 generations \u2014
p257
aVthat is to say, into the indefinite future.
p258
aVBut does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species?
p259
aVWell maybe so. But I don't think so.
p260
aa(lp261
VAt Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical
p262
aVsustainable, zero-footprint industrial company
p263
aVfully into existence by 2020.
p264
aVWe can see our way now,
p265
aVclear to the top of that mountain.
p266
aVAnd now the challenge is in execution.
p267
aVAnd as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says,
p268
aV"If something exists, it must be possible."
p269
aV(Laughter)
p270
aVIf we can actually do it, it must be possible.
p271
aVIf we, a petro-intensive company can do it, anybody can.
p272
aVAnd if anybody can, it follows that everybody can.
p273
aa(lp274
VHawken fulfilled business and industry,
p275
aVleading humankind away from the abyss
p276
aVbecause, with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere,
p277
aVa very dear person is at risk here \u2014
p278
aVfrankly, an unacceptable risk.
p279
aVWho is that person?
p280
aVNot you. Not I.
p281
aVBut let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here.
p282
aVAnd I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb.
p283
aVOn a Tuesday morning in March of 1996,
p284
aVI was talking to people, as I did at every opportunity back then,
p285
aVbringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting.
p286
aVBut about five days later back in Atlanta,
p287
aVI received an email from Glenn Thomas,
p288
aVone of my people in the California meeting.
p289
aVHe was sending me an original poem
p290
aVthat he had composed after our Tuesday morning together.
p291
aVAnd when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life.
p292
aVBecause it told me, by God, one person got it.
p293
aVHere is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person, most at risk.
p294
aVPlease meet "Tomorrow's Child."
p295
aa(lp296
V"Without a name, an unseen face, and knowing not your time or place,
p297
aa(lp298
VTomorrow's child, though yet unborn,
p299
aVI met you first last Tuesday morn.
p300
aa(lp301
VA wise friend introduced us two.
p302
aVAnd through his sobering point of view
p303
aa(lp304
VI saw a day that you would see, a day for you but not for me.
p305
aa(lp306
VKnowing you has changed my thinking.
p307
aVFor I never had an inkling
p308
aa(lp309
Vthat perhaps the things I do might someday,
p310
aVsomehow threaten you.
p311
aa(lp312
VTomorrow's child, my daughter, son,
p313
aa(lp314
VI'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good,
p315
aa(lp316
Vthough always having known I should.
p317
aa(lp318
VBegin, I will.
p319
aa(lp320
VThe way the cost of what I squander, what is lost,
p321
aa(lp322
Vif ever I forget that you
p323
aVwill someday come and live here too."
p324
aa(lp325
VWell, every day of my life since,
p326
aV"Tomorrow's Child" has spoken to me
p327
aVwith one simple but profound message,
p328
aVwhich I presume to share with you.
p329
aVWe are, each and every one,
p330
aVa part of the web of life.
p331
aVThe continuum of humanity, sure, but in a larger sense, the web of life itself.
p332
aVAnd we have a choice to make
p333
aVduring our brief, brief visit
p334
aVto this beautiful blue and green living planet:
p335
aVto hurt it or to help it.
p336
aVFor you, it's your call.
p337
aa(lp338
VThank you.

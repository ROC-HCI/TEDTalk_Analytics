VWe live on a human-dominated planet,
p5
aVputting unprecedented pressure
p6
aVon the systems on Earth.
p7
aVThis is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you,
p8
aVit's also part of the good news.
p9
aVWe're the first generation \u2014 thanks to science \u2014
p10
aVto be informed that we may be
p11
aVundermining the stability and the ability
p12
aVof planet Earth
p13
aVto support human development as we know it.
p14
aVIt's also good news, because the planetary risks we're facing
p15
aVare so large,
p16
aVthat business as usual is not an option.
p17
aVIn fact, we're in a phase
p18
aVwhere transformative change is necessary,
p19
aVwhich opens the window for innovation,
p20
aVfor new ideas and new paradigms.
p21
aVThis is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity
p22
aVin the global phase of sustainability.
p23
aa(lp24
VOn this journey, I'd like to bring, apart from yourselves,
p25
aVa good friend,
p26
aVa stakeholder, who's always absent
p27
aVwhen we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues,
p28
aVa stakeholder who refuses to compromise \u2014
p29
aVplanet Earth.
p30
aVSo I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage,
p31
aVto have her as a witness
p32
aVof a remarkable journey,
p33
aVwhich humbly reminds us
p34
aVof the period of grace we've had
p35
aVover the past 10,000 years.
p36
aVThis is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years.
p37
aVIt's a very important period \u2014
p38
aVit's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet.
p39
aVWe've had the same, roughly, abilities
p40
aVthat developed civilizations as we know it.
p41
aVThis is the environmental conditions on the planet.
p42
aa(lp43
VHere, used as a proxy, temperature variability.
p44
aVIt was a jumpy ride. 80,000 years back in a crisis,
p45
aVwe leave Africa, we colonize Australia
p46
aVin another crisis, 60,000 years back,
p47
aVwe leave Asia for Europe
p48
aVin another crisis, 40,000 years back,
p49
aVand then we enter
p50
aVthe remarkably stable Holocene phase,
p51
aVthe only period in the whole history of the planet,
p52
aVthat we know of, that can support human development.
p53
aVA thousand years into this period,
p54
aVwe abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.
p55
aVWe go from a couple of million people
p56
aVto the seven billion people we are today.
p57
aVThe Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture,
p58
aVwe domesticate animals and plants.
p59
aVYou have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.
p60
aVThe only phase, as we know it
p61
aVthat can support humanity.
p62
aa(lp63
VThe trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze
p64
aVon this poor planet,
p65
aVa quadruple sqeeze, which, as its first squeeze,
p66
aVhas population growth of course.
p67
aVNow, this is not only about numbers;
p68
aVthis is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people
p69
aVcommitted to nine billion people, it's an equity issue as well.
p70
aVThe majority of the environmental impacts on the planet
p71
aVhave been caused by the rich minority,
p72
aVthe 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon
p73
aVin the mid-18th century.
p74
aVThe majority of the planet,
p75
aVaspiring for development, having the right for development,
p76
aVare in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle,
p77
aVa momentous pressure.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe second pressure on the planet is, of course the climate agenda \u2014
p80
aVthe big issue \u2014 where the policy interpretation of science
p81
aVis that it would be enough
p82
aVto stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm
p83
aVto avoid average temperatures
p84
aVexceeding two degrees,
p85
aVto avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing
p86
aVthe West Antarctic Ice Sheet,
p87
aVholding six meters \u2014 level rising,
p88
aVthe risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet,
p89
aVholding another seven meters \u2014 sea level rising.
p90
aVNow, you would have wished the climate pressure
p91
aVto hit a strong planet, a resilient planet,
p92
aVbut unfortunately, the third pressure
p93
aVis the ecosystem decline.
p94
aVNever have we seen, in the past 50 years,
p95
aVsuch a sharp decline
p96
aVof ecosystem functions and services on the planet,
p97
aVone of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term,
p98
aVin our forests, land and biodiversity.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe forth pressure is surprise,
p101
aVthe notion and the evidence
p102
aVthat we need to abandon our old paradigm,
p103
aVthat ecosystems behave linearly, predictably,
p104
aVcontrollably in our \u2014 so to say \u2014 linear systems,
p105
aVand that in fact, surprise is universal,
p106
aVas systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly
p107
aVand often irreversibly.
p108
aVThis, dear friends, poses a human pressure on the planet
p109
aVof momentous scale.
p110
aVWe may, in fact, have entered a new geological era \u2014
p111
aVthe Anthropocene,
p112
aVwhere humans are the predominant driver of change
p113
aVat a planetary level.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, as a scientist,
p116
aVwhat's the evidence for this?
p117
aVWell, the evidence is,
p118
aVunfortunately, ample.
p119
aVIt's not only carbon dioxide
p120
aVthat has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change.
p121
aVYou can take virtually any parameter
p122
aVthat matters for human well-being \u2014
p123
aVnitrous oxide, methane,
p124
aVdeforestation, overfishing
p125
aVland degredation, loss of species \u2014
p126
aVthey all show the same pattern
p127
aVover the past 200 years.
p128
aVSimultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s,
p129
aV10 years after the Second World War,
p130
aVshowing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise
p131
aVstarts in the mid-50s.
p132
aVYou see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level.
p133
aVAnd I can tell you,
p134
aVyou enter the disciplinary research in each of these,
p135
aVyou find something remarkably important,
p136
aVthe conclusion that we may have come to the point
p137
aVwhere we have to bend the curves,
p138
aVthat we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade
p139
aVin the history humanity on the planet,
p140
aVthe decade when we have to bend the curves.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow, as if this was not enough \u2014
p143
aVto just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet \u2014
p144
aVwe also have to recognize the fact
p145
aVthat systems do have multiple stable states,
p146
aVseparated by thresholds \u2014 illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram,
p147
aVwhere the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system.
p148
aVNow, the system may gradually \u2014
p149
aVunder pressure of climate change,
p150
aVerosion, biodiversity loss \u2014
p151
aVlose the depth of the cup, the resilience,
p152
aVbut appear to be healthy
p153
aVand appear to suddenly, under a threshold,
p154
aVbe tipping over. Upff.
p155
aVSorry. Changing state
p156
aVand literally ending up
p157
aVin an undesired situation,
p158
aVwhere new biophysical logic takes over,
p159
aVnew species take over, and the system gets locked.
p160
aa(lp161
VDo we have evidence of this? Yes, coral reef systems.
p162
aVBiodiverse, low-nutrient, hard coral systems
p163
aVunder multiple pressures of overfishing,
p164
aVunsustainable tourism, climate change.
p165
aVA trigger and the system tips over,
p166
aVloses its resilience,
p167
aVsoft corals take over,
p168
aVand we get undesired systems
p169
aVthat cannot support economic and social development.
p170
aVThe Arctic \u2014 a beautiful system \u2014
p171
aVa regulating biome at the planetary level,
p172
aVtaking the knock after knock on climate change,
p173
aVappearing to be in a good state.
p174
aVNo scientist could predict that in 2007,
p175
aVsuddenly, what could be crossing a threshold.
p176
aVThe system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent
p177
aVof its summer ice cover.
p178
aVAnd the drama is, of course, that
p179
aVwhen the system does this, the logic may change.
p180
aVIt may get locked in an undesired state,
p181
aVbecause it changes color, absorbs more energy,
p182
aVand the system may get stuck.
p183
aVIn my mind, the largest red flag warning for humanity
p184
aVthat we are in a precarious situation.
p185
aVAs a sideline, you know that the only red flag that popped up here
p186
aVwas a submarine from an unnamed country
p187
aVthat planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic
p188
aVto be able to control the oil resources.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, if we have evidence, which we now have,
p191
aVthat wetlands, forests,
p192
aV[unclear] monsoon system, the rainforests,
p193
aVbehave in this nonlinear way.
p194
aV30 or so scientists around the world
p195
aVgathered and asked a question for the first time,
p196
aV"Do we have to put the planet into the the pot?"
p197
aVSo we have to ask ourselves:
p198
aVare we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state?
p199
aVAre we in fact putting ourselves in a situation
p200
aVwhere we're coming too close
p201
aVto thresholds that could lead
p202
aVto deleterious and very undesired,
p203
aVif now catastrophic, change
p204
aVfor human development?
p205
aVYou know, you don't want to stand there.
p206
aVIn fact, you're not even allowed to stand
p207
aVwhere this gentleman is standing,
p208
aVat the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold.
p209
aVIn fact, there's a fence
p210
aVquite upstream of this threshold,
p211
aVbeyond which you are in a danger zone.
p212
aVAnd this is the new paradigm,
p213
aVwhich we gathered two, three years back,
p214
aVrecognizing that our old paradigm
p215
aVof just analyzing and pushing and predicting
p216
aVparameters into the future,
p217
aVaiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow we to ask ourselves:
p220
aVwhich are the large environmental processes
p221
aVthat we have to be stewards of
p222
aVto keep ourselves safe in the Holocene?
p223
aVAnd could we even,
p224
aVthanks to major advancements in Earth systems science,
p225
aVidentify the thresholds,
p226
aVthe points where we may expect nonlinear change?
p227
aVAnd could we even define
p228
aVa planetary boundary, a fence,
p229
aVwithin which we then have a safe operating space for humanity?
p230
aVThis work, which was published in "Nature,"
p231
aVlate 2009,
p232
aVafter a number of years of analysis,
p233
aVled to the final proposition
p234
aVthat we can only find
p235
aVnine planetary boundaries
p236
aVwith which, under active stewardship,
p237
aVwould allow ourselves to have a safe operating space.
p238
aVThese include, of course, climate.
p239
aVIt may surprise you that it's not only climate.
p240
aVBut it shows that we are interconnected, among many systems on the planet,
p241
aVwith the three big systems, climate change,
p242
aVstratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification
p243
aVbeing the three big systems,
p244
aVwhere the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds
p245
aVin the paleo-record of the history of the planet.
p246
aa(lp247
VBut we also include, what we call, the slow variables,
p248
aVthe systems that, under the hood,
p249
aVregulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet \u2014
p250
aVthe interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet,
p251
aVland use change, rate of biodiversity loss,
p252
aVfreshwater use,
p253
aVfunctions which regulate
p254
aVbiomass on the planet, carbon sequestration, diversity.
p255
aVAnd then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify \u2014
p256
aVair pollution,
p257
aVincluding warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates,
p258
aVbut also chemical pollution.
p259
aVTogether, these form an integrated whole
p260
aVfor guiding human development in the Anthropocene,
p261
aVunderstanding that the planet
p262
aVis a complex self-regulating system.
p263
aVIn fact, most evidence indicates
p264
aVthat these nine may behave as three Musketeers,
p265
aV"One for all. All for one."
p266
aVYou degrade forests, you go beyond the boundary on land,
p267
aVyou undermine the ability of the climate system
p268
aVto stay stable.
p269
aVThe drama here is, in fact, that
p270
aVit may show that the climate challenge
p271
aVis the easy one,
p272
aVif you consider the whole challenge
p273
aVof sustainable development.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development
p276
aVwithin the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries.
p277
aVWhat you see here in black line is the safe operating space,
p278
aVthe quantified boundaries,
p279
aVas suggested by this analysis.
p280
aVThe yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point,
p281
aVthe pre-industrial point,
p282
aVwhere we're very safely in the safe operating space.
p283
aVIn the '50s, we start branching out.
p284
aVIn the '60s already, through the green revolution
p285
aVand the Haber-Bosch process
p286
aVof fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere \u2014
p287
aVyou know, human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere
p288
aVthan the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole.
p289
aVWe don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '90s,
p290
aVactually, right after Rio.
p291
aVAnd today, we are in a situation where we estimate
p292
aVthat we've transgressed three boundaries,
p293
aVthe rate of biodiversity loss,
p294
aVwhich is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity \u2014
p295
aVone of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs \u2014
p296
aVnitrogen and climate change.
p297
aVBut we still have some degrees of freedom on the others,
p298
aVbut we are approaching fast
p299
aVon land, water, phosphorus and oceans.
p300
aVBut this gives a new paradigm
p301
aVto guide humanity,
p302
aVto put the light on our, so far
p303
aVoverpowered industrial vehicle,
p304
aVwhich operates as if
p305
aVwe're only on a dark, straight highway.
p306
aa(lp307
VNow the question then is:
p308
aVhow gloomy is this?
p309
aVIs then sustainable development utopia?
p310
aVWell, there's no science to suggest.
p311
aVIn fact, there is ample science
p312
aVto indicate that we can do this transformative change,
p313
aVthat we have the ability
p314
aVto now move into a new innovative,
p315
aVa transformative gear,
p316
aVacross scales.
p317
aVThe drama is, of course,
p318
aVis that 200 countries on this planet
p319
aVhave to simultaneously start moving
p320
aVin the same direction.
p321
aVBut it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm,
p322
aVfrom the current linear,
p323
aVcommand and control thinking,
p324
aVlooking at efficiencies and optimization
p325
aVtowards a much more flexible,
p326
aVa much more adaptive approach,
p327
aVwhere we recognize that redundancy,
p328
aVboth in social and environmental systems,
p329
aVis key to be able to deal
p330
aVwith a turbulent era of global change.
p331
aVWe have to invest in persistence,
p332
aVin the ability of social systems and ecological systems
p333
aVto withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup.
p334
aVWe have to invest in transformations capability,
p335
aVmoving from crisis into innovation
p336
aVand the ability to rise after a crisis,
p337
aVand of course to adapt to unavoidable change.
p338
aVThis is a new paradigm.
p339
aVWe're not doing that at any scale on governance.
p340
aa(lp341
VBut is it happening anywhere?
p342
aVDo we have any examples of success
p343
aVon this mind shift being applied at the local level?
p344
aVWell, yes, in fact we do
p345
aVand the list can start becoming longer and longer.
p346
aVThere's good news here,
p347
aVfor example, from Latin America,
p348
aVwhere plow-based farming systems
p349
aVof the '50s and '60s
p350
aVled farming basically to a dead-end,
p351
aVwith lower and lower yields, degrading the organic matter
p352
aVand fundamental problems at the livelihood levels
p353
aVin Paraguay, Uruguay and a number of countries, Brazil,
p354
aVleading to innovation and entrepreneurship
p355
aVamong farmers in partnership with scientists
p356
aVinto an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems
p357
aVcombined with mulch farming
p358
aVwith locally adapted technologies,
p359
aVwhich today, for example, in some countries,
p360
aVhave led to a tremendous increase
p361
aVin area under mulch, zero till farming
p362
aVwhich, not only produces more food,
p363
aVbut also sequesters carbon.
p364
aa(lp365
VThe Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story.
p366
aVUnder the realization from tourist operators,
p367
aVfishermen,
p368
aVthe Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists
p369
aVthat the Great Barrier Reef is doomed
p370
aVunder the current governance regime.
p371
aVGlobal change, beautification rack culture,
p372
aVoverfishing and unsustainable tourism,
p373
aVall together placing this system
p374
aVin the realization of crisis.
p375
aVBut the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset,
p376
aVwhich today has led to a completely new governance strategy
p377
aVto build resilience,
p378
aVacknowledge redundancy
p379
aVand invest in the whole system as an integrated whole,
p380
aVand then allow for much more redundancy in the system.
p381
aa(lp382
VSweden, the country I come from, has other examples,
p383
aVwhere wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as \u2014
p384
aVas in many countries \u2014 as flood-prone polluted nuisance
p385
aVin the peri-urban regions.
p386
aVBut again, a crisis, new partnerships,
p387
aVactors locally, transforming these
p388
aVinto a key component
p389
aVof sustainable urban planning.
p390
aVSo crisis leading into opportunities.
p391
aa(lp392
VNow, what about the future?
p393
aVWell, the future, of course, has one massive challenge,
p394
aVwhich is feeding a world of nine billion people.
p395
aVWe need nothing less than a new green revolution,
p396
aVand the planet boundaries shows
p397
aVthat agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.
p398
aVIt has to basically do this on current land.
p399
aVWe cannot expand anymore,
p400
aVbecause it erodes the planetary boundaries.
p401
aVWe cannot continue consuming water as we do today,
p402
aVwith 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean.
p403
aVAnd we need a transformation.
p404
aVWell, interestingly, and based on my work
p405
aVand others in Africa, for example,
p406
aVwe've shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems,
p407
aVwith innovations and supplementary irrigation
p408
aVto bridge dry spells and droughts,
p409
aVsustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients
p410
aVfrom toilets back to farmers' fields,
p411
aVand innovations in tillage systems,
p412
aVwe can triple, quadruple, yield levels
p413
aVon current land.
p414
aa(lp415
VElinor Ostrom,
p416
aVthe latest Nobel laureate of economics,
p417
aVclearly shows empirically across the world
p418
aVthat we can govern the commons
p419
aVif we invest in trust,
p420
aVlocal, action-based partnerships
p421
aVand cross-scale institutional innovations,
p422
aVwhere local actors,
p423
aVtogether, can deal with the global commons
p424
aVat a large scale.
p425
aVBut even on the hard policy area we have innovations.
p426
aVWe know that we have to move from our fossil dependence
p427
aVvery quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time.
p428
aVAnd what shall we do?
p429
aVEverybody talks about carbon taxes \u2014 it won't work \u2014 emission schemes,
p430
aVbut for example, one policy measure,
p431
aVfeed-in tariffs on the energy system,
p432
aVwhich is already applied,
p433
aVfrom China doing it on offshore wind systems,
p434
aVall the way to the U.S.
p435
aVwhere you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy,
p436
aVbut you can subsidize electricity to poor people.
p437
aVYou get people out of poverty.
p438
aVYou solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector,
p439
aVwhile at the same time, stimulating innovation \u2014
p440
aVexamples of things that can be out scaled quickly
p441
aVat the planetary level.
p442
aa(lp443
VSo there is \u2014 no doubt \u2014 opportunity here,
p444
aVand we can list many, many examples
p445
aVof transformative opportunities around the planet.
p446
aVThe key though in all of these,
p447
aVthe red thread,
p448
aVis the shift in mindset,
p449
aVmoving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves
p450
aVinto a dark future,
p451
aVwhere we instead backcast our future,
p452
aVand we say, "What is the playing field on the planet?
p453
aVWhat are the planetary boundaries
p454
aVwithin which we can safely operate?"
p455
aVand then backtrack innovations within that.
p456
aVBut of course, the drama is, it clearly shows
p457
aVthat incremental change is not an option.
p458
aa(lp459
VSo, there is scientific evidence.
p460
aVThey sort of say the harsh news,
p461
aVthat we are facing the largest
p462
aVtransformative development
p463

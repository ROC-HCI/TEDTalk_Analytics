VThe global challenge that I want to talk to you about today
p5
aVrarely makes the front pages.
p6
aVIt, however, is enormous
p7
aVin both scale and importance.
p8
aVLook, you all are very well traveled;
p9
aVthis is TEDGlobal after all.
p10
aVBut I do hope to take you to some places
p11
aVyou've never been to before.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, let's start off in China.
p14
aVThis photo was taken two weeks ago.
p15
aVActually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders
p16
aVhas just graduated from high school.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVBut this is Tiananmen Square.
p19
aVMany of you have been there. It's not the real China.
p20
aVLet me take you to the real China.
p21
aVThis is in the Dabian Mountains
p22
aVin the remote part of Hubei province in central China.
p23
aVDai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts.
p24
aVShe lives with her parents,
p25
aVher two brothers and her great-aunt.
p26
aVThey have a hut that has no electricity,
p27
aVno running water,
p28
aVno wristwatch, no bicycle.
p29
aVAnd they share this great splendor
p30
aVwith a very large pig.
p31
aVDai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said,
p32
aV"We're going to pull you out of school
p33
aVbecause the 13-dollar school fees are too much for us.
p34
aVYou're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies.
p35
aVWhy would we waste this money on you?"
p36
aVThis is what happens to girls in remote areas.
p37
aa(lp38
VTurns out that Dai Manju was
p39
aVthe best pupil in her grade.
p40
aVShe still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse
p41
aVand tried to catch every little bit of information
p42
aVthat seeped out of the doors.
p43
aVWe wrote about her in The New York Times.
p44
aVWe got a flood of donations \u2014
p45
aVmostly 13-dollar checks
p46
aVbecause New York Times readers are very generous
p47
aVin tiny amounts
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVbut then, we got a money transfer
p50
aVfor $10,000 \u2014
p51
aVreally nice guy.
p52
aVWe turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school.
p53
aVHe was delighted.
p54
aVHe thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school.
p55
aVI can give scholarships to all the girls,
p56
aVyou know, if they work hard and stay in school.
p57
aVSo Dai Manju basically
p58
aVfinished out middle school.
p59
aVShe went to high school.
p60
aVShe went to vocational school for accounting.
p61
aVShe scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south.
p62
aVShe found a job, she scouted for jobs
p63
aVfor her classmates and her friends.
p64
aVShe sent money back to her family.
p65
aVThey built a new house,
p66
aVthis time with running water,
p67
aVelectricity, a bicycle,
p68
aVno pig.
p69
aa(lp70
VWhat we saw was a natural experiment.
p71
aVIt is rare to get an exogenous investment
p72
aVin girls' education.
p73
aVAnd over the years, as we followed Dai Manju, we were able to see
p74
aVthat she was able to move out of a vicious cycle
p75
aVand into a virtuous cycle.
p76
aVShe not only changed her own dynamic,
p77
aVshe changed her household, she changed her family, her village.
p78
aVThe village became a real standout.
p79
aVOf course, most of China was flourishing at the time,
p80
aVbut they were able to get a road built
p81
aVto link them up to the rest of China.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd that brings me to my first major
p84
aVof two tenets of "Half the Sky."
p85
aVAnd that is that
p86
aVthe central moral challenge
p87
aVof this century
p88
aVis gender inequity.
p89
aVIn the 19th century, it was slavery.
p90
aVIn the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.
p91
aVThe cause of our time
p92
aVis the brutality that so many people
p93
aVface around the world because of their gender.
p94
aVSo some of you may be thinking,
p95
aV"Gosh, that's hyperbole.
p96
aVShe's exaggerating."
p97
aVWell, let me ask you this question.
p98
aVHow many of you think there are more males or more females in the world?
p99
aVLet me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world?
p100
aVHands up, please.
p101
aVHow many of you think \u2014 a few \u2014 how many of you there are more females in the world?
p102
aVOkay, most of you.
p103
aVWell, you know this latter group, you're wrong.
p104
aVThere are, true enough,
p105
aVin Europe and the West,
p106
aVwhen women and men
p107
aVhave equal access to food and health care,
p108
aVthere are more women, we live longer.
p109
aVBut in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case.
p110
aVIn fact, demographers have shown
p111
aVthat there are anywhere between 60 million
p112
aVand 100 million
p113
aVmissing females in the current population.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd, you know, it happens for several reasons.
p116
aVFor instance, in the last half-century,
p117
aVmore girls were discriminated to death
p118
aVthan all the people killed on all the battlefields
p119
aVin the 20th century.
p120
aVSometimes it's also because of the sonogram.
p121
aVGirls get aborted before they're even born
p122
aVwhen there are scarce resources.
p123
aVThis girl here, for instance,
p124
aVis in a feeding center in Ethiopia.
p125
aVThe entire center was filled with girls like her.
p126
aVWhat's remarkable is that her brothers, in the same family,
p127
aVwere totally fine.
p128
aVIn India, in the first year of life,
p129
aVfrom zero to one,
p130
aVboy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate
p131
aVbecause they depend upon the breast,
p132
aVand the breast shows no son preference.
p133
aVFrom one to five,
p134
aVgirls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate
p135
aVthan boys, in all of India.
p136
aa(lp137
VThe second tenet of "Half the Sky"
p138
aVis that, let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all,
p139
aVand just on a purely practical level,
p140
aVwe think that
p141
aVone of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism
p142
aVis to educate girls
p143
aVand to bring women into the formal labor force.
p144
aVPoverty, for instance.
p145
aVThere are three reasons why this is the case.
p146
aVFor one, overpopulation is one of
p147
aVthe persistent causes of poverty.
p148
aVAnd you know, when you educate a boy,
p149
aVhis family tends to have fewer kids,
p150
aVbut only slightly.
p151
aVWhen you educate a girl,
p152
aVshe tends to have significantly fewer kids.
p153
aVThe second reason is
p154
aVit has to do with spending.
p155
aVIt's kind of like the dirty, little secret of poverty,
p156
aVwhich is that,
p157
aVnot only do poor people
p158
aVtake in very little income,
p159
aVbut also, the income that they take in,
p160
aVthey don't spend it very wisely,
p161
aVand unfortunately, most of that spending is done by men.
p162
aVSo research has shown,
p163
aVif you look at people who live under two dollars a day \u2014
p164
aVone metric of poverty \u2014
p165
aVtwo percent of that take-home pay
p166
aVgoes to this basket here, in education.
p167
aV20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of
p168
aValcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks \u2014
p169
aVand prostitution and festivals.
p170
aVIf you just take four percentage points
p171
aVand put it into this basket,
p172
aVyou would have a transformative effect.
p173
aa(lp174
VThe last reason has to do
p175
aVwith women being part of the solution, not the problem.
p176
aVYou need to use scarce resources.
p177
aVIt's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju.
p178
aVBill Gates put it very well
p179
aVwhen he was traveling through Saudi Arabia.
p180
aVHe was speaking to an audience much like yourselves.
p181
aVHowever, two-thirds of the way there was a barrier.
p182
aVOn this side was men,
p183
aVand then the barrier, and this side was women.
p184
aVAnd someone from this side of the room got up and said,
p185
aV"Mr. Gates, we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia
p186
aVto be one of the top 10 countries
p187
aVwhen it comes to technology.
p188
aVDo you think we'll make it?"
p189
aVSo Bill Gates, as he was staring out at the audience, he said,
p190
aV"If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country,
p191
aVthere is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10."
p192
aVSo here is Bill of Arabia.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VSo what would some of the specific challenges
p197
aVlook like?
p198
aVI would say, on the top of the agenda
p199
aVis sex trafficking.
p200
aVAnd I'll just say two things about this.
p201
aVThe slavery at the peak of the slave trade
p202
aVin the 1780s:
p203
aVthere were about 80,000 slaves
p204
aVtransported from Africa to the New World.
p205
aVNow, modern slavery:
p206
aVaccording to State Department rough statistics,
p207
aVthere are about 800,000 \u2014 10 times the number \u2014
p208
aVthat are trafficked across international borders.
p209
aVAnd that does not even include those
p210
aVthat are trafficked within country borders,
p211
aVwhich is a substantial portion.
p212
aVAnd if you look at
p213
aVanother factor, another contrast,
p214
aVa slave back then is worth
p215
aVabout $40,000
p216
aVin today's money.
p217
aVToday, you can buy a girl trafficked
p218
aVfor a few hundred dollars,
p219
aVwhich means she's actually more disposable.
p220
aVBut you know, there is progress being made
p221
aVin places like Cambodia and Thailand.
p222
aVWe don't have to expect a world
p223
aVwhere girls are bought and sold or killed.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe second item on the agenda
p226
aVis maternal mortality.
p227
aVYou know, childbirth in this part of the world
p228
aVis a wonderful event.
p229
aVIn Niger, one in seven women
p230
aVcan expect to die during childbirth.
p231
aVAround the world,
p232
aVone woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth.
p233
aVYou know, it's not as though
p234
aVwe don't have the technological solution,
p235
aVbut these women have three strikes against them:
p236
aVthey are poor, they are rural
p237
aVand they are female.
p238
aVYou know, for every woman who does die,
p239
aVthere are 20 who survive
p240
aVbut end up with an injury.
p241
aVAnd the most devastating injury
p242
aVis obstetric fistula.
p243
aVIt's a tearing during obstructed labor
p244
aVthat leaves a woman incontinent.
p245
aa(lp246
VLet me tell you about Mahabuba.
p247
aVShe lives in Ethiopia.
p248
aVShe was married against her will at age 13.
p249
aVShe got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby,
p250
aVbut you know, her body was very immature,
p251
aVand she ended up having obstructed labor.
p252
aVThe baby died, and she ended up with a fistula.
p253
aVSo that meant she was incontinent;
p254
aVshe couldn't control her wastes.
p255
aVIn a word, she stank.
p256
aVThe villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her.
p257
aVSo finally, they put her at the edge of the village in a hut.
p258
aVThey ripped off the door
p259
aVso that the hyenas would get her at night.
p260
aVThat night, there was a stick in the hut.
p261
aVShe fought off the hyenas with that stick.
p262
aVAnd the next morning,
p263
aVshe knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary,
p264
aVshe would be saved.
p265
aVBecause she had some damage to her nerves,
p266
aVshe crawled all the way \u2014 30 miles \u2014
p267
aVto that doorstep, half dead.
p268
aVThe foreign missionary opened the door,
p269
aVknew exactly what had happened,
p270
aVtook her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa,
p271
aVand she was repaired
p272
aVwith a 350-dollar operation.
p273
aVThe doctors and nurses there noticed
p274
aVthat she was not only a survivor,
p275
aVshe was really clever, and they made her a nurse.
p276
aVSo now, Mahabuba,
p277
aVshe is saving the lives
p278
aVof hundreds, thousands, of women.
p279
aVShe has become part of the solution, not the problem.
p280
aVShe's moved out of a vicious cycle
p281
aVand into a virtuous cycle.
p282
aa(lp283
VI've talked about some of the challenges,
p284
aVlet me talk about some of the solutions,
p285
aVand there are predictable solutions.
p286
aVI've hinted at them: education
p287
aVand also economic opportunity.
p288
aVSo of course, when you educate a girl,
p289
aVshe tends to get married later on in life,
p290
aVshe tends to have kids later on in life, she tends to have fewer kids,
p291
aVand those kids that she does have,
p292
aVshe educates them in a more enlightened fashion.
p293
aVWith economic opportunity,
p294
aVit can be transformative.
p295
aa(lp296
VLet me tell you about Saima.
p297
aVShe lives in a small village outside Lahore, Pakistan.
p298
aVAnd at the time, she was miserable.
p299
aVShe was beaten every single day
p300
aVby her husband, who was unemployed.
p301
aVHe was kind of a gambler type \u2014 and unemployable, therefore \u2014
p302
aVand took his frustrations out on her.
p303
aVWell, when she had her second daughter,
p304
aVher mother in-law told her son,
p305
aV"I think you'd better get a second wife.
p306
aVSaima's not going to produce you a son."
p307
aVThis is when she had her second daughter.
p308
aVAt the time, there was
p309
aVa microlending group in the village
p310
aVthat gave her a 65-dollar loan.
p311
aVSaima took that money,
p312
aVand she started an embroidery business.
p313
aVThe merchants liked her embroidery; it sold very well,
p314
aVand they kept asking for more.
p315
aVAnd when she couldn't produce enough,
p316
aVshe hired other women in the village.
p317
aVPretty soon she had 30 women in the village
p318
aVworking for her embroidery business.
p319
aVAnd then,
p320
aVwhen she had to transport all of the embroidery goods
p321
aVfrom the village to the marketplace,
p322
aVshe needed someone to help her do the transport,
p323
aVso she hired her husband.
p324
aVSo now they're in it together.
p325
aVHe does the transportation and distribution,
p326
aVand she does the production and sourcing.
p327
aVAnd now they have a third daughter,
p328
aVand the daughters, all of them, are being tutored in education
p329
aVbecause Saima knows what's really important.
p330
aa(lp331
VWhich brings me to the final element, which is education.
p332
aVLarry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank,
p333
aVonce said that, "It may well be
p334
aVthat the highest return on investment
p335
aVin the developing world
p336
aVis in girls' education."
p337
aVLet me tell you about Beatrice Biira.
p338
aVBeatrice was living in Uganda
p339
aVnear the Congo border,
p340
aVand like Dai Manju, she didn't go to school.
p341
aVActually, she had never been to school,
p342
aVnot to a lick, one day.
p343
aVHer parents, again, said,
p344
aV"Why should we spend the money on her?
p345
aVShe's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth."
p346
aVWell, it just so happens, at that time,
p347
aVthere was a group in Connecticut
p348
aVcalled the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut.
p349
aVThey made a donation to an organization
p350
aVbased in Arkansas
p351
aVcalled Heifer International.
p352
aVHeifer sent two goats to Africa.
p353
aVOne of them ended up with Beatrice's parents,
p354
aVand that goat had twins.
p355
aVThe twins started producing milk.
p356
aVThey sold the milk for cash.
p357
aVThe cash started accumulating,
p358
aVand pretty soon the parents said,
p359
aV"You know, we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school."
p360
aVSo at nine years of age,
p361
aVBeatrice started in first grade \u2014
p362
aVafter all, she'd never been to a lick of school \u2014
p363
aVwith a six year-old.
p364
aVNo matter, she was just delighted to be in school.
p365
aVShe rocketed to the top of her class.
p366
aVShe stayed at the top of her class
p367
aVthrough elementary school, middle school,
p368
aVand then in high school,
p369
aVshe scored brilliantly on the national examinations
p370
aVso that she became the first person in her village,
p371
aVever, to come to the United States
p372
aVon scholarship.
p373
aVTwo years ago,
p374
aVshe graduated from Connecticut College.
p375
aVOn the day of her graduation,
p376
aVshe said, "I am the luckiest girl alive
p377
aVbecause of a goat."
p378
aV(Laughter)
p379
aVAnd that goat was $120.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo you see how transformative
p382
aVlittle bits of help can be.
p383
aVBut I want to give you a reality check.
p384
aVLook: U.S. aid, helping people is not easy,
p385
aVand there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid.
p386
aVThere's Bill Easterly's book.
p387
aVThere's a book called "Dead Aid."
p388
aVYou know, the criticism is fair;
p389
aVit isn't easy.
p390
aVYou know, people say how
p391
aVhalf of all water well projects, a year later, are failed.
p392
aVWhen I was in Zimbabwe,
p393
aVwe were touring a place with the village chief \u2014
p394
aVhe wanted to raise money for a secondary school \u2014
p395
aVand there was some construction a few yards away,
p396
aVand I said, "What's that?"
p397
aVHe sort of mumbled.
p398
aVTurns out that it's a failed irrigation project.
p399
aVA few yards away was a failed chicken coop.
p400
aVOne year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there.
p401
aVIt's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater;
p402
aVyou actually improve.
p403
aVYou learn from your mistakes, and you continuously improve.
p404
aa(lp405
VWe also think that individuals
p406
aVcan make a difference, and they should,
p407
aVbecause individuals, together,
p408
aVwe can all help create a movement.
p409
aVAnd a movement of men and women
p410
aVis what's needed to bring about social change,
p411
aVchange that will address
p412
aVthis great moral challenge.
p413
aVSo then, I ask,
p414
aVwhat's in it for you?
p415
aVYou're probably asking that. Why should you care?
p416
aVI will just leave you with two things.
p417
aVOne is that research shows
p418
aVthat once you have
p419
aVall of your material needs taken care of \u2014
p420
aVwhich most of us, all of us, here in this room do \u2014
p421
aVresearch shows that
p422
aVthere are very few things in life
p423
aVthat can actually elevate your level of happiness.
p424
aVOne of those things
p425
aVis contributing to a cause larger than yourself.
p426
aa(lp427
VAnd the second thing,
p428
aVit's an anecdote that I'll leave you with.
p429
aVAnd that is the story
p430
aVof an aid worker in Darfur.
p431
aVHere was a woman
p432
aVwho had worked in Darfur,
p433
aVseeing things that no human being should see.
p434
aVThroughout her time there,
p435
aVshe was strong, she was steadfast.
p436
aVShe never broke down.
p437
aVAnd then she came back to the United States
p438
aVand was on break, Christmas break.
p439
aVShe was in her grandmother's backyard,
p440
aVand she saw something that made her break down in tears.
p441
aVWhat that was
p442
aVwas a bird feeder.
p443
aVAnd she realized that she had the great fortune
p444
aVto be born in a country
p445
aVwhere we take security for granted,
p446
aVwhere we not only can feed, clothe
p447
aVand house ourselves,
p448
aVbut also provide for wild birds
p449
aVso they don't go hungry in the winter.
p450
aVAnd she realized that with that great fortune
p451
aVcomes great responsibility.
p452
aVAnd so, like her,
p453
aVyou, me,
p454
aVwe have all won the lottery of life.
p455
aVAnd so the question becomes:
p456
aVhow do we discharge that responsibility?
p457
aa(lp458
VSo, here's the cause.
p459
aVJoin the movement.
p460
aVFeel happier and help save the world.
p461
aa(lp462
VThank you very much.

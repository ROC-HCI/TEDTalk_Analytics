VGood morning!
p5
aVAre you awake?
p6
aVThey took my name tag, but I wanted to ask you,
p7
aVdid anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic?
p8
aVAnyone! No one? All right, no problem.
p9
aa(lp10
VOnce upon a time, not long ago,
p11
aVI was sitting in a restaurant with my friend, ordering food.
p12
aVSo I looked at the waiter and said,
p13
aV"Do you have a menu (Arabic)?"
p14
aVHe looked at me strangely, thinking that he misheard.
p15
aVHe said, "Sorry? (English)."
p16
aVI said, "The menu (Arabic), please."
p17
aVHe replied, "Don't you know what they call it?"
p18
aV"I do."
p19
aVHe said, "No! It's called "menu" (English), or "menu" (French)."
p20
aVIs the French pronunciation correct?
p21
aV"Come, come, take care of this one!" said the waiter.
p22
aVHe was disgusted when talking to me, as if he was saying to himself,
p23
aV"If this was the last girl on Earth, I wouldn't look at her!"
p24
aVWhat's the meaning of saying "menu" in Arabic?
p25
aVTwo words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward
p26
aVand ignorant.
p27
aVHow could she speak that way?
p28
aa(lp29
VAt that moment, I started thinking.
p30
aVIt made me mad.
p31
aVIt definitely hurts!
p32
aVI'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country?
p33
aVWhere could this happen?
p34
aVHow did we get here?
p35
aa(lp36
VWell, while we are here, there are many people like me,
p37
aVwho would reach a stage in their lives, where they involuntarily give up
p38
aVeverything that has happened to them in the past,
p39
aVjust so they can say that they're modern
p40
aVand civilized.
p41
aVShould I forget all my culture, thoughts,
p42
aVintellect and all my memories?
p43
aVChildhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war!
p44
aVShould I forget everything I learned in Arabic, just to conform?
p45
aVTo be one of them?
p46
aVWhere's the logic in that?
p47
aVDespite all that, I tried to understand him.
p48
aVI didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me.
p49
aa(lp50
VThe Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs.
p51
aVIt's not a language for science,
p52
aVresearch,
p53
aVa language we're used to in universities,
p54
aVa language we use in the workplace,
p55
aVa language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project,
p56
aVand it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport.
p57
aVIf we did so, they'd strip us of our clothes.
p58
aVWhere can I use it, then? We could all ask this question!
p59
aVSo, you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so?
p60
aVThis is one reality.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut we have another more important reality that we ought to think about.
p63
aVArabic is the mother tongue.
p64
aVResearch says that mastery of other languages
p65
aVdemands mastery of the mother tongue.
p66
aVMastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages.
p67
aa(lp68
VHow?
p69
aVGibran Khalil Gibran,
p70
aVwhen he first started writing, he used Arabic.
p71
aVAll his ideas, imagination and philosophy
p72
aVwere inspired by this little boy in the village
p73
aVwhere he grew up, smelling a specific smell,
p74
aVhearing a specific voice,
p75
aVand thinking a specific thought.
p76
aVSo, when he started writing in English, he had enough baggage.
p77
aVEven when he wrote in English,
p78
aVwhen you read his writings in English, you smell the same smell,
p79
aVsense the same feeling.
p80
aVYou can imagine that that's him writing in English,
p81
aVthe same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon.
p82
aVSo, this is an example no one can argue with.
p83
aa(lp84
VSecond, it's often said that if you want to kill a nation,
p85
aVthe only way to kill a nation,
p86
aVis to kill its language.
p87
aVThis is a reality that developed societies are aware of.
p88
aVThe Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese, all these nations are aware of this.
p89
aVThat's why they legislate to protect their language.
p90
aVThey make it sacred.
p91
aVThat's why they use it in production, they pay a lot of money to develop it.
p92
aVDo we know better than them?
p93
aa(lp94
VAll right,
p95
aVwe aren't from the developed world,
p96
aVthis advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet,
p97
aVand we would like to catch up with the civilized world.
p98
aVCountries that were once like us, but decided to strive for development,
p99
aVdo research,
p100
aVand catch up with those countries,
p101
aVsuch as Turkey, Malaysia and others,
p102
aVthey carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder,
p103
aVprotected it like a diamond.
p104
aVThey kept it close to them.
p105
aVBecause if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere
p106
aVand it's not labeled in Turkish,
p107
aVthen it isn't a local product.
p108
aVYou wouldn't believe it's a local product.
p109
aVThey'd go back to being consumers,
p110
aVclueless consumers, like we are most of the time.
p111
aVSo, in order for them to innovate and produce, they had to protect their language.
p112
aVIf I say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence (Arabic),"
p113
aVwhat does this remind you of?
p114
aVIt doesn't ring a bell, does it?
p115
aVRegardless of the who, how and why.
p116
aa(lp117
VLanguage isn't just for conversing, just words coming out of our mouths.
p118
aVLanguage represents specific stages in our lives,
p119
aVand terminology that is linked to our emotions.
p120
aVSo when we say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence,"
p121
aVeach one of you draws a specific image in their own mind,
p122
aVthere are specific feelings
p123
aVof a specific day in a specific historical period.
p124
aa(lp125
VLanguage isn't one, two or three words or letters put together.
p126
aVIt's an idea inside that relates to how we think,
p127
aVand how we see each other and how others see us.
p128
aVWhat is our intellect?
p129
aVHow do you say whether this guy understands or not?
p130
aVSo, if I say, "Freedom, sovereignty, independence (English),"
p131
aVor if your son came up to you and said,
p132
aV"Dad, have you lived through the period of the freedom (English) slogan?"
p133
aVHow would you feel?
p134
aVIf you don't see a problem,
p135
aVthen I'd better leave, and stop talking in vain.
p136
aa(lp137
VThe idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing.
p138
aVI have a francophone friend who's married to a French man.
p139
aVI asked her once how things were going.
p140
aVShe said, "Everything is fine,
p141
aVbut once, I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate
p142
aVthe meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him."
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aV(Applause)
p145
aVThe poor woman had mistakenly told him "toqborni,"
p146
aVand then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him.
p147
aVHe was puzzled by the thought: "How could anyone be this cruel?
p148
aVDoes she want to commit suicide?
p149
aV'Bury me?' (English)"
p150
aVThis is one of the few examples.
p151
aa(lp152
VIt made us feel that she's unable to tell that word to her husband,
p153
aVsince he won't understand,
p154
aVand he's right not to; his way of thinking is different.
p155
aVShe said to me, "He listens to Fairuz with me,
p156
aVand one night, I tried to translate for him
p157
aVso he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz."
p158
aVThe poor woman tried to translate this for him:
p159
aV"From them I extended my hands and stole you \u2014"
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVAnd here's the pickle:
p162
aV"And because you belong to them, I returned my hands and left you."
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVTranslate that for me.
p165
aV(Applause)
p166
aa(lp167
VSo, what have we done to protect the Arabic language?
p168
aVWe turned this into a concern of the civil society,
p169
aVand we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language.
p170
aVEven though many people told me, "Why do you bother?
p171
aVForget about this headache and go have fun."
p172
aVNo problem!
p173
aVThe campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says,
p174
aV"I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West."
p175
aVWe didn't say, "No! We do not accept this or that."
p176
aVWe didn't adopt this style because that way, we wouldn't be understood.
p177
aVAnd when someone talks to me that way, I hate the Arabic language.
p178
aVWe say\u2014
p179
aV(Applause)
p180
aa(lp181
VWe want to change our reality,
p182
aVand be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams, aspirations and day-to-day life.
p183
aVIn a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do.
p184
aVSo, "I talk to you from the East, but you reply from the West"
p185
aVhas hit the spot.
p186
aVSomething very easy, yet creative and persuasive.
p187
aVAfter that, we launched another campaign
p188
aVwith scenes of letters on the ground.
p189
aVYou've seen an example of it outside,
p190
aVa scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape
p191
aVwith "Don't kill your language!" written on it.
p192
aVWhy? Seriously, don't kill your language.
p193
aVWe really shouldn't kill our language.
p194
aVIf we were to kill the language, we'd have to find an identity.
p195
aa(lp196
VWe'd have to find an existence.
p197
aVWe'd go back to the beginning.
p198
aVThis is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized.
p199
aa(lp200
VAfter that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter.
p201
aVPhotos of "cool" guys and girls.
p202
aVWe are very cool!
p203
aVAnd to whoever might say, "Ha! You used an English word!"
p204
aVI say, "No! I adopt the word 'cool.'"
p205
aVLet them object however they want, but give me a word that's nicer
p206
aVand matches the reality better.
p207
aVI will keep on saying "Internet"
p208
aVI wouldn't say: "I'm going to the world wide web"
p209
aV(Laughs)
p210
aVBecause it doesn't fit! We shouldn't kid ourselves.
p211
aVBut to reach this point, we all have to be convinced
p212
aVthat we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger
p213
aVor thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language,
p214
aVto control us or make us think and feel what they want.
p215
aa(lp216
VCreativity is the idea.
p217
aVSo, if we can't reach space or build a rocket and so on,
p218
aVwe can be creative.
p219
aVAt this moment, every one of you is a creative project.
p220
aVCreativity in your mother tongue is the path.
p221
aVLet's start from this moment.
p222
aVLet's write a novel or produce a short film.
p223
aVA single novel could make us global again.
p224
aVIt could bring the Arabic language back to being number one.
p225
aVSo, it's not true that there's no solution; there is a solution!
p226
aVBut we have to know that, and be convinced that a solution exists,
p227
aVthat we have a duty to be part of that solution.
p228
aa(lp229
VIn conclusion, what can you do today?
p230
aVNow, tweets, who's tweeting?
p231
aVPlease, I beg of you, even though my time has finished,
p232
aVeither Arabic, English, French or Chinese.
p233
aVBut don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers!
p234
aV(Applause)
p235
aVIt's a disaster! That's not a language.
p236
aVYou'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language.
p237
aVIt's not easy to come back from such a place and rise.
p238
aVThat's the first thing we can do.
p239
aa(lp240
VSecond, there are many other things that we can do.
p241
aVWe're not here today to convince each other.
p242
aVWe're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language.
p243
aVNow I will tell you a secret.
p244
aVA baby first identifies its father
p245
aVthrough language.
p246
aVWhen my daughter is born, I'll tell her, "This is your father, honey (Arabic)."
p247
aVI wouldn't say, "This is your dad, honey (English)."
p248
aVAnd in the supermarket, I promise my daughter Noor,
p249
aVthat if she says to me, "Thanks (Arabic),"
p250
aVI won't say, "Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'" and hope no one has heard her.
p251
aV(Applause)
p252
aa(lp253
VLet's get rid of this cultural cringe.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Applause)

VWell, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVChris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.
p7
aVAnd since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it.
p8
aVBut it slightly bores me.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVAnd, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something \u2014
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aV\u2014 I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made,
p13
aVand why Francis and I found it.
p14
aVAnd then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say
p15
aVwhat makes me tick now.
p16
aa(lp17
VIn back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.
p18
aVI was at the University of Chicago, in my third year,
p19
aVand I was in my third year because the University of Chicago
p20
aVlet you in after two years of high school.
p21
aVSo you \u2014 it was fun to get away from high school \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p22
aVbecause I was very small, and I was no good in sports,
p23
aVor anything like that.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut I should say that my background \u2014 my father was, you know,
p26
aVraised to be an Episcopalian and Republican,
p27
aVbut after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVAnd my mother was Irish Catholic,
p30
aVand \u2014 but she didn't take religion too seriously.
p31
aVAnd by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass,
p32
aVand going on birdwatching walks with my father.
p33
aVSo early on, I heard of Charles Darwin.
p34
aVI guess, you know, he was the big hero.
p35
aVAnd, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major,
p38
aVand thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough,
p39
aVmaybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.
p40
aVThen, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book
p41
aVcalled "What is Life?" by the great physicist, Schrodinger.
p42
aVAnd that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.
p43
aVYou know, Darwin explained life after it got started,
p44
aVbut what was the essence of life?
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd Schrodinger said the essence was information
p47
aVpresent in our chromosomes, and it had to be present
p48
aVon a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.
p49
aVYou know chromosomes, but this was a molecule,
p50
aVand somehow all the information was probably present
p51
aVin some digital form. And there was the big question
p52
aVof, how did you copy the information?
p53
aa(lp54
VSo that was the book. And so, from that moment on,
p55
aVI wanted to be a geneticist \u2014
p56
aVunderstand the gene and, through that, understand life.
p57
aVSo I had, you know, a hero at a distance.
p58
aVIt wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling.
p59
aVAnd so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down.
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aVSo I went to Indiana,
p62
aVwhich was actually as good as Caltech in genetics,
p63
aVand besides, they had a really good basketball team. (Laughter)
p64
aVSo I had a really quite happy life at Indiana.
p65
aVAnd it was at Indiana I got the impression
p66
aVthat, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA.
p67
aVAnd so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well,
p70
aVmaybe I could become a biochemist,
p71
aVbut I discovered biochemistry was very boring.
p72
aVIt wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was;
p73
aVit was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book.
p74
aVYou can read it in about two hours.
p75
aVAnd \u2014 but then I went to a meeting in Italy.
p76
aVAnd there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program,
p77
aVand he talked about DNA.
p78
aVAnd this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist,
p79
aVand after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA
p80
aVbecause DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute
p81
aVto possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.
p82
aVMost people believed it was proteins.
p83
aVBut Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet,
p84
aVand he showed this x-ray photograph.
p85
aVSort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure,
p86
aVeven though it owed it to probably different molecules
p87
aVcarrying different sets of instructions.
p88
aVSo there was something universal about the DNA molecule.
p89
aVSo I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher,
p90
aVand I ended up in Cambridge, England.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo I went to Cambridge,
p93
aVbecause it was really the best place in the world then
p94
aVfor x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject
p95
aVin, you know, chemistry departments.
p96
aVI mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.
p97
aVSo the best place for x-ray crystallography
p98
aVwas at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.
p99
aVAnd there I met Francis Crick.
p100
aVI went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23.
p101
aVAnd within a day, we had decided that
p102
aVmaybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.
p103
aVNot solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model,
p104
aVan electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know,
p105
aVlength, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.
p106
aVBut just ask what the molecule \u2014 how should it fold up?
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph,
p109
aVis Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed
p110
aVthe alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so,
p111
aVhe banished the man out on the right,
p112
aVSir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.
p113
aVThis is a photograph several years later,
p114
aVwhen Bragg had cause to smile.
p115
aVHe certainly wasn't smiling when I got there,
p116
aVbecause he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix,
p117
aVand the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists.
p118
aVAnd certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists,
p119
aVso we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins.
p120
aVSo Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.
p121
aVX-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo we built a three-stranded model.
p124
aVThe people from London came up.
p125
aVWilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator,
p126
aVRosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.
p127
aVThey said it was lousy, and it was.
p128
aVSo we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVAnd so we didn't build any models,
p131
aVand Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.
p132
aVAnd basically, I did nothing. And \u2014 except read.
p133
aVYou know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.
p134
aVAnd we kept telling the people in London
p135
aVthat Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA.
p136
aVIf DNA is that important, Linus will know it.
p137
aVHe'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd, in fact, he'd written the people in London:
p140
aVCould he see their x-ray photograph?
p141
aVAnd they had the wisdom to say "no." So he didn't have it.
p142
aVBut there was ones in the literature.
p143
aVActually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully.
p144
aVBut about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge,
p145
aVa rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son,
p146
aVwho was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA.
p147
aVAnd so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling,
p148
aVand he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts.
p149
aVAnd boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.
p150
aVI have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.
p154
aVAnd I read it, and it was just \u2014 it was crap.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVSo this was, you know, unexpected from the world's \u2014
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aV\u2014 and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds
p159
aVbetween phosphate groups.
p160
aVWell, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven,
p161
aVthose hydrogen bonds couldn't exist.
p162
aVWe rushed over to the chemistry department and said,
p163
aV"Could Pauling be right?" And Alex Hust said, "No." So we were happy.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened
p167
aVthat somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong.
p168
aVAnd so Bragg said, "Build models."
p169
aVAnd a month after we got the Pauling manuscript \u2014
p170
aVI should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people.
p171
aVWell, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game
p172
aVand that they should immediately start building models.
p173
aVBut Wilkins said "no." Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months,
p174
aVand after she left he would start building models.
p175
aVAnd so I came back with that news to Cambridge,
p176
aVand Bragg said, "Build models."
p177
aVWell, of course, I wanted to build models.
p178
aVAnd there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know,
p179
aVin one sense she was a chemist,
p180
aVbut really she would have been trained \u2014
p181
aVshe didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry.
p182
aVShe was a crystallographer.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models
p185
aVwas, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist.
p186
aVAnd so Crick and I, you know, started building models,
p187
aVand I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough.
p188
aVWell, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.
p189
aVAnd it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule:
p190
aVNever be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't.
p191
aVWe weren't the best chemists in the room.
p192
aVI went in and showed them a pairing I'd done,
p193
aVand Jerry Donohue \u2014 he was a chemist \u2014 he said, it's wrong.
p194
aVYou've got \u2014 the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.
p195
aVI just put them down like they were in the books.
p196
aVHe said they were wrong.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo the next day, you know, after I thought, "Well, he might be right."
p199
aVSo I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing,
p200
aVand Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.
p201
aVAnd we knew we were right.
p202
aVSo it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.
p203
aVFrom nothing to thing.
p204
aVAnd we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T
p205
aVand G next to C, you have a copying mechanism.
p206
aVSo we saw how genetic information is carried.
p207
aVIt's the order of the four bases.
p208
aVSo in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.
p209
aVAnd you copy it by going from strand-separating.
p210
aVSo, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it,
p211
aVbecause you didn't have any other scheme.
p212
aV(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VBut that's not the way most scientists think.
p215
aVMost scientists are really rather dull.
p216
aVThey said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.
p217
aVBut, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.
p218
aVSo think about it. The next five years,
p219
aVthere were essentially something like five references
p220
aVto our work in "Nature" \u2014 none.
p221
aVAnd so we were left by ourselves,
p222
aVand trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you \u2014
p223
aVwhat does this genetic information do?
p224
aVIt was pretty obvious that it provided the information
p225
aVto an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?
p226
aVFor about three years we just \u2014 I tried to solve the structure of RNA.
p227
aVIt didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs.
p228
aVI was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me.
p229
aVIt was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VSo there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl,
p233
aVso I'm still looking happy.
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVBut there is what we did when we didn't know
p236
aVwhere to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.
p237
aVGeorge Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.
p238
aVHe was one of the members. The question was:
p239
aVHow do you go from a four-letter code
p240
aVto the 20-letter code of proteins?
p241
aVFeynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow.
p242
aVBut that's the only \u2014 no, we were only photographed twice.
p243
aVAnd on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.
p244
aVThere's Francis up on the upper right,
p245
aVand Alex Rich \u2014 the M.D.-turned-crystallographer \u2014 is next to me.
p246
aVThis was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955.
p247
aVAnd I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think,
p248
aVbecause the girl I had, boy, she was gone.
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd so I didn't really get happy until 1960,
p252
aVbecause then we found out, basically, you know,
p253
aVthat there are three forms of RNA.
p254
aVAnd we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.
p255
aVRNA provides the information for protein.
p256
aVAnd that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA \u2014 synthetic RNA \u2014
p257
aVput it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine,
p258
aVpolyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code,
p259
aVand it was all over by 1966.
p260
aVSo there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was \u2014
p261
aVso what happened since then?
p262
aVWell, at that time \u2014 I should go back.
p263
aVWhen we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk
p264
aVat Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard,
p265
aVhe looked at me and said, "Are you going to patent this?"
p266
aVAnd \u2014 but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it,
p267
aVbecause you couldn't. No use for it.
p268
aV(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd so DNA didn't become a useful molecule,
p271
aVand the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973,
p272
aV20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco
p273
aVand Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA,
p274
aVand Stanford patented it and made a lot of money.
p275
aVAt least they patented something
p276
aVwhich, you know, could do useful things.
p277
aVAnd then, they learned how to read the letters for the code.
p278
aVAnd, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And,
p279
aVbut we were still a long ways from, you know,
p280
aVanswering a question which sort of dominated my childhood,
p281
aVwhich is: How do you nature-nurture?
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd so I'll go on. I'm already out of time,
p284
aVbut this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician
p285
aVturned physicist. And he developed a technique
p286
aVwhich essentially will let us look at sample DNA
p287
aVand, eventually, a million spots along it.
p288
aVThere's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one
p289
aVmade by a photolithography by a company in Madison
p290
aVcalled NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix.
p291
aVAnd we use their technique.
p292
aVAnd what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.
p293
aVAnd you can see on the top
p294
aVthat cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.
p295
aVSo the DNA is really badly mucked up,
p296
aVwhereas if you have a chance of surviving,
p297
aVthe DNA isn't so mucked up.
p298
aVSo we think that this will eventually lead to what we call
p299
aV"DNA biopsies." Before you get treated for cancer,
p300
aVyou should really look at this technique,
p301
aVand get a feeling of the face of the enemy.
p302
aVIt's not a \u2014 it's only a partial look, but it's a \u2014
p303
aVI think it's going to be very, very useful.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo, we started with breast cancer
p306
aVbecause there's lots of money for it, no government money.
p307
aVAnd now I have a sort of vested interest:
p308
aVI want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know,
p309
aVyou aren't treated if it's not dangerous.
p310
aVBut Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells,
p311
aVand made a really sort of surprising observation.
p312
aVWhich is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome
p313
aVwhere we've lost a gene or gained another one.
p314
aVSo we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well,
p315
aVif we're around here, you know,
p316
aVthese little losses or gains might not be too bad.
p317
aVBut if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene,
p318
aVmaybe we'll feel sick.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo the first disease he looked at is autism.
p321
aVAnd the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.
p322
aVLooking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child
p323
aVwith Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism,
p324
aVhad sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it.
p325
aVCouldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it
p326
aVwe began to find genes for autism.
p327
aVAnd you can see here, there are a lot of them.
p328
aVSo a lot of autistic kids are autistic
p329
aVbecause they just lost a big piece of DNA.
p330
aVI mean, big piece at the molecular level.
p331
aVWe saw one autistic kid,
p332
aVabout five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.
p333
aVWe haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably
p334
aVdon't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents.
p335
aVNow, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars.
p336
aVI think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position
p337
aVto help parents who've had an autistic child,
p338
aVor think they may have an autistic child,
p339
aVand can we spot the difference?
p340
aVSo this same technique should probably look at all.
p341
aVIt's a wonderful way to find genes.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd so, I'll conclude by saying
p344
aVwe've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.
p345
aVAnd we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred
p346
aVbefore we got the picture. But as you can see,
p347
aVthere's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.
p348
aVAnd yet, in the controls there were three.
p349
aVSo what's the meaning of the controls?
p350
aVWere they crazy also, and we didn't know it?
p351
aVOr, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal.
p352
aVAnd what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure,
p353
aVand whether this is one that predisposes \u2014
p354
aVand then there's only a sub-segment of the population
p355
aVthat's capable of being schizophrenic.
p356
aa(lp357
VNow, we don't have really any evidence of it,
p358
aVbut I think, to give you a hypothesis, the best guess
p359
aVis that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia.
p360
aV30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed,
p361
aVand schizophrenia has a very funny genetics,
p362
aVwhich means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed,
p363
aVbut only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say.
p364
aVNow, some people who think they're right-handed
p365
aVare genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think,
p366
aVoh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know,
p367
aVchildren won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK?
p368
aV(Laughter)
p369
aa(lp370
VSo it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time.
p371
aVWe ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar;
p372
aVthere's a relationship.
p373
aVAnd if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.
p374
aVI thank you.

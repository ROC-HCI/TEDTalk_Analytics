VJenni Chang: When I told my parents I was gay,
p5
aVthe first thing they said to me was,
p6
aV"We're bringing you back to Taiwan."
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VIn their minds, my sexual orientation was America's fault.
p11
aVThe West had corrupted me with divergent ideas,
p12
aVand if only my parents had never left Taiwan,
p13
aVthis would not have happened to their only daughter.
p14
aVIn truth, I wondered if they were right.
p15
aa(lp16
VOf course, there are gay people in Asia,
p17
aVjust as there are gay people in every part of the world.
p18
aVBut is the idea of living an "out" life,
p19
aVin the "I'm gay, this is my spouse, and we're proud of our lives together"
p20
aVkind of way just a Western idea?
p21
aa(lp22
VIf I had grown up in Taiwan, or any place outside of the West,
p23
aVwould I have found models of happy, thriving LGBT people?
p24
aa(lp25
VLisa Dazols: I had similar notions.
p26
aVAs an HIV social worker in San Francisco,
p27
aVI had met many gay immigrants.
p28
aVThey told me their stories of persecution in their home countries,
p29
aVjust for being gay,
p30
aVand the reasons why they escaped to the US.
p31
aVI saw how this had beaten them down.
p32
aVAfter 10 years of doing this kind of work,
p33
aVI needed better stories for myself.
p34
aVI knew the world was far from perfect,
p35
aVbut surely not every gay story was tragic.
p36
aa(lp37
VJC: So as a couple, we both had a need to find stories of hope.
p38
aVSo we set off on a mission to travel the world
p39
aVand look for the people we finally termed as the "Supergays."
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VThese would be the LGBT individuals
p44
aVwho were doing something extraordinary in the world.
p45
aVThey would be courageous, resilient,
p46
aVand most of all, proud of who they were.
p47
aVThey would be the kind of person that I aspire to be.
p48
aVOur plan was to share their stories to the world through film.
p49
aa(lp50
VLD: There was just one problem.
p51
aVWe had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VWe didn't even know where to find the Supergays,
p56
aVso we just had to trust that we'd figure it all out along the way.
p57
aVSo we picked 15 countries in Asia, Africa and South America,
p58
aVcountries outside the West that varied in terms of LGBT rights.
p59
aVWe bought a camcorder,
p60
aVordered a book on how to make a documentary \u2014
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
Vyou can learn a lot these days \u2014
p65
aVand set off on an around-the-world trip.
p66
aa(lp67
VJC: One of the first countries that we traveled to was Nepal.
p68
aVDespite widespread poverty, a decade-long civil war,
p69
aVand now recently, a devastating earthquake,
p70
aVNepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality.
p71
aVOne of the key figures in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha.
p72
aVA beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman,
p73
aVBhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school
p74
aVand getting incarcerated because of her gender presentation.
p75
aVBut, in 2007, Bhumika and Nepal's LGBT rights organization
p76
aVsuccessfully petitioned the Nepali Supreme Court
p77
aVto protect against LGBT discrimination.
p78
aa(lp79
VHere's Bhumika:
p80
aa(lp81
V(Video) BS: What I'm most proud of?
p82
aVI'm a transgendered person.
p83
aVI'm so proud of my life.
p84
aVOn December 21, 2007,
p85
aVthe supreme court gave the decision for the Nepal government
p86
aVto give transgender identity cards
p87
aVand same-sex marriage.
p88
aa(lp89
VLD: I can appreciate Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis.
p90
aVSomething as simple as using a public restroom
p91
aVcan be a huge challenge when you don't fit in
p92
aVto people's strict gender expectations.
p93
aVTraveling throughout Asia,
p94
aVI tended to freak out women in public restrooms.
p95
aVThey weren't used to seeing someone like me.
p96
aVI had to come up with a strategy, so that I could just pee in peace.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VSo anytime I would enter a restroom,
p101
aVI would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts,
p102
aVand try to be as non-threatening as possible.
p103
aVPutting out my hands and saying, "Hello",
p104
aVjust so that people could hear my feminine voice.
p105
aVThis all gets pretty exhausting, but it's just who I am.
p106
aVI can't be anything else.
p107
aa(lp108
VJC: After Nepal, we traveled to India.
p109
aVOn one hand, India is a Hindu society,
p110
aVwithout a tradition of homophobia.
p111
aVOn the other hand, it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system,
p112
aVwhich rejects anything that threatens the male-female order.
p113
aVWhen we spoke to activists,
p114
aVthey told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality,
p115
aVwhere the women's status is established in society.
p116
aVAnd in that way, the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well.
p117
aa(lp118
VLD: There we met Prince Manvendra.
p119
aVHe's the world's first openly gay prince.
p120
aVPrince Manvendra came out on the "Oprah Winfrey Show,"
p121
aVvery internationally.
p122
aVHis parents disowned him
p123
aVand accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family.
p124
aVWe sat down with Prince Manvendra
p125
aVand talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly.
p126
aa(lp127
VHere he is:
p128
aa(lp129
V(Video) Prince Manvendra:  I felt there was a lot of need
p130
aVto break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society.
p131
aVAnd that instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself.
p132
aVWhether we are gay, we are lesbian, we are transgender, bisexual
p133
aVor whatever sexual minority we come from,
p134
aVwe have to all unite and fight for our rights.
p135
aVGay rights cannot be won in the court rooms,
p136
aVbut in the hearts and the minds of the people.
p137
aa(lp138
VJC: While getting my hair cut,
p139
aVthe woman cutting my hair asked me,
p140
aV"Do you have a husband?"
p141
aVNow, this was a dreaded question
p142
aVthat I got asked a lot by locals while traveling.
p143
aVWhen I explained to her that I was with a woman instead of a man,
p144
aVshe was incredulous,
p145
aVand she asked me a lot of questions about my parents' reactions
p146
aVand whether I was sad that I'd never be able to have children.
p147
aVI told her that there are no limitations to my life
p148
aVand that Lisa and I do plan to have a family some day.
p149
aVNow, this woman was ready to write me off
p150
aVas yet another crazy Westerner.
p151
aVShe couldn't imagine that such a phenomenon
p152
aVcould happen in her own country.
p153
aVThat is, until I showed her the photos of the Supergays
p154
aVthat we interviewed in India.
p155
aVShe recognized Prince Manvendra from television
p156
aVand soon I had an audience of other hairdressers
p157
aVinterested in meeting me.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd in that ordinary afternoon,
p162
aVI had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon
p163
aVto the social changes that were happening in their own country.
p164
aa(lp165
VLD: From India, we traveled to East Africa,
p166
aVa region known for intolerance towards LGBT people.
p167
aVIn Kenya, 89 percent of people who come out to their families
p168
aVare disowned.
p169
aVHomosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration.
p170
aVIn Kenya, we met the soft-spoken David Kuria.
p171
aVDavid had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor
p172
aVand improve his own government.
p173
aVSo he decided to run for senate.
p174
aVHe became Kenya's first openly gay political candidate.
p175
aVDavid wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was.
p176
aVBut we were worried for his safety
p177
aVbecause he started to receive death threats.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Video) David Kuria:  At that point, I was really scared
p180
aVbecause they were actually asking for me to be killed.
p181
aVAnd, yeah,
p182
aVthere are some people out there who do it
p183
aVand they feel that they are doing a religious obligation.
p184
aa(lp185
VJC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was.
p186
aVEven in the face of threats,
p187
aVhe stayed authentic.
p188
aa(lp189
VLD: At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina.
p190
aVArgentina's a country where 92 percent of the population identifies as Catholic.
p191
aVYet, Argentina has LGBT laws that are even more progressive
p192
aVthan here in the US.
p193
aVIn 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America
p194
aVand the 10th in the world to adopt marriage equality.
p195
aa(lp196
VThere, we met María Rachid.
p197
aVMaría was a driving force behind that movement.
p198
aa(lp199
VMaría Rachid (Spanish): I always say that, in reality,
p200
aVthe effects of marriage equality
p201
aVare not only for those couples that get married.
p202
aVThey are for a lot of people that, even though they may never get married,
p203
aVwill be perceived differently by their coworkers,
p204
aVtheir families and neighbors,
p205
aVfrom the national state's message of equality.
p206
aVI feel very proud of Argentina
p207
aVbecause Argentina today is a model of equality.
p208
aVAnd hopefully soon,
p209
aVthe whole world will have the same rights.
p210
aa(lp211
VJC: When we made the visit to my ancestral lands,
p212
aVI wish I could have shown my parents what we found there.
p213
aVBecause here is who we met:
p214
aa(lp215
V(Video) One, two, three. Welcome gays to Shanghai!
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VA whole community of young, beautiful Chinese LGBT people.
p220
aVSure, they had their struggles.
p221
aVBut they were fighting it out.
p222
aVIn Shanghai, I had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group
p223
aVand tell them our story in my broken Mandarin Chinese.
p224
aVIn Taipei, each time we got onto the metro,
p225
aVwe saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands.
p226
aVAnd we learned that Asia's largest LGBT pride event
p227
aVhappens just blocks away from where my grandparents live.
p228
aVIf only my parents knew.
p229
aa(lp230
VLD: By the time we finished our not-so-straight journey around the world,
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
Vwe had traveled 50,000 miles
p235
aVand logged 120 hours of video footage.
p236
aVWe traveled to 15 countries
p237
aVand interviewed 50 Supergays.
p238
aVTurns out, it wasn't hard to find them at all.
p239
aa(lp240
VJC: Yes, there are still tragedies that happen
p241
aVon the bumpy road to equality.
p242
aVAnd let's not forget that 75 countries still criminalize homosexuality today.
p243
aVBut there are also stories of hope and courage
p244
aVin every corner of the world.
p245
aVWhat we ultimately took away from our journey is,
p246
aVequality is not a Western invention.
p247
aa(lp248
VLD: One of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum,
p249
aVmomentum as more and more people embrace their full selves
p250
aVand use whatever opportunities they have
p251
aVto change their part of the world,
p252
aVand momentum as more and more countries
p253
aVfind models of equality in one another.
p254
aVWhen Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination,
p255
aVIndia pushed harder.
p256
aVWhen Argentina embraced marriage equality,
p257
aVUruguay and Brazil followed.
p258
aVWhen Ireland said yes to equality,
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
Vthe world stopped to notice.
p263
aVWhen the US Supreme Court makes a statement to the world
p264
aVthat we can all be proud of.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Applause)
p267
aa(lp268
VJC: As we reviewed our footage,
p269
aVwhat we realized is that we were watching a love story.
p270
aVIt wasn't a love story that was expected of me,
p271
aVbut it is one filled with more freedom, adventure and love
p272
aVthan I could have ever possibly imagined.
p273
aVOne year after returning home from our trip,
p274
aVmarriage equality came to California.
p275
aVAnd in the end, we believe, love will win out.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Video) By the power vested in me,
p278
aVby the state of California
p279
aVand by God Almighty,
p280
aVI now pronounce you spouses for life.
p281
aVYou may kiss.
p282

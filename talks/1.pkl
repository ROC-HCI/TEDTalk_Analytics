VThank you so much, Chris.
p5
aVAnd it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity
p6
aVto come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful.
p7
aVI have been blown away by this conference,
p8
aVand I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments
p9
aVabout what I had to say the other night.
p10
aVAnd I say that sincerely,
p11
aVpartly because (Mock sob)
p12
aVI need that.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VPut yourselves in my position.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VI flew on Air Force Two for eight years.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VNow I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
V(Applause)
p29
aa(lp30
VI'll tell you one quick story
p31
aVto illustrate what that's been like for me.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VIt's a true story \u2014 every bit of this is true.
p36
aa(lp37
VSoon after Tipper and I left the \u2014 (Mock sob) White House \u2014
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
Vwe were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have
p42
aV50 miles east of Nashville.
p43
aVDriving ourselves.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VI know it sounds like a little thing to you, but \u2014
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VI looked in the rear-view mirror
p52
aVand all of a sudden it just hit me.
p53
aVThere was no motorcade back there.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VYou've heard of phantom limb pain?
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VThis was a rented Ford Taurus.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VIt was dinnertime,
p66
aVand we started looking for a place to eat.
p67
aVWe were on I-40.
p68
aVWe got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.
p69
aVWe got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant.
p70
aVLow-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it.
p71
aVWe went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over,
p72
aVmade a big commotion over Tipper.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VShe took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us,
p77
aVand she lowered her voice so much,
p78
aVI had to really strain to hear what she was saying.
p79
aVAnd she said "Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore
p80
aVand his wife, Tipper."
p81
aVAnd the man said,
p82
aV"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?"
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
V(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VThere's been kind of a series of epiphanies.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VThe very next day, continuing the totally true story,
p93
aVI got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria,
p94
aVin the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy.
p95
aVAnd I began the speech by telling them the story
p96
aVof what had just happened the day before in Nashville.
p97
aVAnd I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you:
p98
aVTipper and I were driving ourselves,
p99
aVShoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain,
p100
aVwhat the man said \u2014 they laughed.
p101
aVI gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home.
p102
aVI fell asleep on the plane
p103
aVuntil, during the middle of the night, we landed
p104
aVon the Azores Islands for refueling.
p105
aVI woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air,
p106
aVand I looked, and there was a man running across the runway.
p107
aVAnd he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling,
p108
aV"Call Washington! Call Washington!"
p109
aVAnd I thought to myself, in the middle of the night,
p110
aVin the middle of the Atlantic,
p111
aVwhat in the world could be wrong in Washington?
p112
aVThen I remembered it could be a bunch of things.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VBut what it turned out to be,
p117
aVwas that my staff was extremely upset
p118
aVbecause one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story
p119
aVabout my speech,
p120
aVand it had already been printed in cities
p121
aVall across the United States of America.
p122
aVIt was printed in Monterey, I checked.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd the story began,
p127
aV"Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote:
p128
aV'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" \u2014
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
V"'named Shoney's,
p133
aVand we are running it ourselves.'"
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VBefore I could get back to U.S. soil,
p138
aVDavid Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on \u2014
p139
aVone of them had me in a big white chef's hat,
p140
aVTipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!"
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VThree days later,
p145
aVI got a nice, long, handwritten letter
p146
aVfrom my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying,
p147
aV"Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!"
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VWe like to celebrate each other's successes in life.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VI was going to talk about information ecology.
p156
aVBut I was thinking that,
p157
aVsince I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED,
p158
aVthat maybe I could talk about that another time.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VChris Anderson: It's a deal!
p163
aa(lp164
V(Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
VAl Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said
p167
aVyou would like me to elaborate on:
p168
aVWhat can you do about the climate crisis?
p169
aVI want to start with a couple of \u2014
p170
aVI'm going to show some new images,
p171
aVand I'm going to recapitulate just four or five.
p172
aVNow, the slide show.
p173
aVI update the slide show every time I give it.
p174
aVI add new images,
p175
aVbecause I learn more about it every time I give it.
p176
aVIt's like beach-combing, you know?
p177
aVEvery time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells.
p178
aVJust in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January.
p179
aVThis is just for the United States of America.
p180
aVHistorical average for Januarys is 31 degrees;
p181
aVlast month was 39.5 degrees.
p182
aa(lp183
VNow, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment \u2014
p184
aVI'm kidding.
p185
aVBut these are the recapitulation slides,
p186
aVand then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do.
p187
aVBut I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.
p188
aVFirst of all, this is where we're projected to go
p189
aVwith the U.S. contribution to global warming,
p190
aVunder business as usual.
p191
aVEfficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy
p192
aVis the low-hanging fruit.
p193
aVEfficiency and conservation \u2014 it's not a cost; it's a profit.
p194
aVThe sign is wrong.
p195
aVIt's not negative; it's positive.
p196
aVThese are investments that pay for themselves.
p197
aVBut they are also very effective in deflecting our path.
p198
aa(lp199
VCars and trucks \u2014 I talked about that in the slideshow,
p200
aVbut I want you to put it in perspective.
p201
aVIt's an easy, visible target of concern \u2014
p202
aVand it should be \u2014
p203
aVbut there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings
p204
aVthan from cars and trucks.
p205
aVCars and trucks are very significant,
p206
aVand we have the lowest standards in the world.
p207
aVAnd so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle.
p208
aVOther transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks.
p209
aVRenewables at the current levels of technological efficiency
p210
aVcan make this much difference.
p211
aVAnd with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here \u2014
p212
aVthere are a lot of people directly involved in this \u2014
p213
aVthis wedge is going to grow much more rapidly
p214
aVthan the current projection shows it.
p215
aVCarbon Capture and Sequestration \u2014 that's what CCS stands for \u2014
p216
aVis likely to become the killer app that will enable us
p217
aVto continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.
p218
aVNot quite there yet.
p219
aVOK. Now, what can you do?
p220
aa(lp221
VReduce emissions in your home.
p222
aVMost of these expenditures are also profitable.
p223
aVInsulation, better design.
p224
aVBuy green electricity where you can.
p225
aVI mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid.
p226
aVUse light rail.
p227
aVFigure out some of the other options that are much better.
p228
aVIt's important.
p229
aa(lp230
VBe a green consumer.
p231
aVYou have choices with everything you buy,
p232
aVbetween things that have a harsh effect,
p233
aVor a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis.
p234
aVConsider this:
p235
aVMake a decision to live a carbon-neutral life.
p236
aVThose of you who are good at branding,
p237
aVI'd love to get your advice and help
p238
aVon how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.
p239
aVIt is easier than you think.
p240
aVIt really is.
p241
aVA lot of us in here have made that decision,
p242
aVand it is really pretty easy.
p243
aVIt means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions
p244
aVwith the full range of choices that you make,
p245
aVand then purchase or acquire offsets
p246
aVfor the remainder that you have not completely reduced.
p247
aVAnd what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.
p248
aa(lp249
VThere is a carbon calculator.
p250
aVParticipant Productions convened \u2014
p251
aVwith my active involvement \u2014
p252
aVthe leading software writers in the world,
p253
aVon this arcane science of carbon calculation,
p254
aVto construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator.
p255
aVYou can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are,
p256
aVand then you will be given options to reduce.
p257
aVAnd by the time the movie comes out in May,
p258
aVthis will be updated to 2.0,
p259
aVand we will have click-through purchases of offsets.
p260
aa(lp261
VNext, consider making your business carbon-neutral.
p262
aVAgain, some of us have done that,
p263
aVand it's not as hard as you think.
p264
aVIntegrate climate solutions into all of your innovations,
p265
aVwhether you are from the technology,
p266
aVor entertainment, or design and architecture community.
p267
aVInvest sustainably.
p268
aVMajora mentioned this.
p269
aVListen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate
p270
aVon the basis of their annual performance,
p271
aVdon't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management.
p272
aVOver time, people do what you pay them to do.
p273
aVAnd if they judge how much they're going to get paid
p274
aVon your capital that they've invested,
p275
aVbased on the short-term returns,
p276
aVyou're going to get short-term decisions.
p277
aVA lot more to be said about that.
p278
aa(lp279
VBecome a catalyst of change.
p280
aVTeach others, learn about it, talk about it.
p281
aVThe movie is a movie version of the slideshow
p282
aVI gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.
p283
aVAnd it comes out in May.
p284
aVMany of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.
p285
aVConsider sending somebody to Nashville.
p286
aVPick well.
p287
aVAnd I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow \u2014
p288
aVre-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced
p289
aVwith a generic approach,
p290
aVand it's not just the slides, it's what they mean.
p291
aVAnd it's how they link together.
p292
aVAnd so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer
p293
aVfor a group of people that are nominated by different folks
p294
aVto come and then give it en masse,
p295
aVin communities all across the country,
p296
aVand we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week,
p297
aVto keep it right on the cutting edge.
p298
aVWorking with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process,
p299
aVposted with tools and limited-use copyrights,
p300
aVso that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VWhere did anybody get the idea
p305
aVthat you ought to stay arm's length from politics?
p306
aVIt doesn't mean that if you're a Republican,
p307
aVthat I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat.
p308
aVWe need Republicans as well.
p309
aVThis used to be a bipartisan issue,
p310
aVand I know that in this group it really is.
p311
aVBecome politically active.
p312
aVMake our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.
p313
aVSupport the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014
p314
aVglobal warming pollution \u2014 and trading it.
p315
aVHere's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system,
p316
aVit's not a closed system.
p317
aVOnce it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation,
p318
aVthen everybody who's on a board of directors \u2014
p319
aVhow many people here serve on the board of directors
p320
aVof a corporation?
p321
aVOnce it's a closed system,
p322
aVyou will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO
p323
aVto get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions
p324
aVthat can be avoided.
p325
aVThe market will work to solve this problem \u2014
p326
aVif we can accomplish this.
p327
aVHelp with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.
p328
aVWe have to change the minds of the American people.
p329
aVBecause presently, the politicians do not have permission
p330
aVto do what needs to be done.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes
p333
aVmediating between wealth and power the way it once did.
p334
aVIt's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads.
p335
aVWe have to buy a lot of those ads.
p336
aVLet's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested.
p337
aVI like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse,"
p338
aVbut again, those of you who are good at branding,
p339
aVI need your help on this.
p340
aVSomebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me,
p341
aVis whether the combination of an opposable thumb
p342
aVand a neocortex is a viable combination.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VThat's really true.
p347
aa(lp348
VI said the other night, and I'll repeat now:
p349
aVthis is not a political issue.
p350
aVAgain, the Republicans here \u2014 this shouldn't be partisan.
p351
aVYou have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.
p352
aVThis is an opportunity.
p353
aVNot just this, but connected to the ideas that are here,
p354
aVto bring more coherence to them.
p355
aVWe are one.
p356
aa(lp357
VThank you very much, I appreciate it.
p358
aa(lp359

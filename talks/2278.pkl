VThis is a play called "Sell/Buy/Date."
p5
aVIt's my first since "Bridge and Tunnel," which I did on Broadway,
p6
aVand this one, I \u2014 thank you \u2014
p7
aVI've excerpted it just for you, so here we go.
p8
aa(lp9
VRight. Class, let's be absolutely certain
p10
aVall electronic devices are switched off before we begin.
p11
aVSo class, hopefully you'll recognize what you just heard me say as the \u2014 ?
p12
aVVery good, the cellular phone announcement.
p13
aVRight? This was also known as a mobile phone.
p14
aVSo you'll remember, people of that era
p15
aVwould have had an external electronic device, right,
p16
aVsomething like this,
p17
aVand they all would have carried one of these around with them,
p18
aVand amongst their biggest fears was the sheer mortification
p19
aVthat one of these might ring at some inopportune moment.
p20
aVRight? So a bit of trivia about that era for you.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VSo the format of today's class is
p24
aVI will be presenting multiple BERT modules today
p25
aVfrom that period in history, right,
p26
aVso starting circa 2016.
p27
aVAnd remember, this was the very first year of the BERT program.
p28
aVSo we've got quite a few of these to get through.
p29
aVBear in mind, I will be living into various different bodies,
p30
aVdifferent ages,
p31
aValso what were then called races, or ethnic groups,
p32
aVas you'll remember from Unit 1.
p33
aVAnd \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and along the gender continuum,
p34
aVI will be living into males as well.
p35
aVIt was quite binary at that time.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVAlso, don't forget, we are reading the book module
p38
aVfor next week's focus on gender.
p39
aVNow, I know some of you have requested the book in pill form.
p40
aVI know people still believe ingesting it is better for retention,
p41
aVbut since we are trying to experience what our forebears did, right,
p42
aVlet's please just consider doing the actual ocular reading, okay?
p43
aVAnd also, how many people have your emotional shunts engaged?
p44
aVRight. Please toggle them off. Okay?
p45
aVI know it's challenging, but I want you to be able to feel the entire
p46
aVnatural emo range, all right?
p47
aVIt is essential to this part of the syllabus.
p48
aVYes, Macy?
p49
aVAll right. I understand. If you're unwilling to \u2014
p50
aVAll right, well, we can discuss that after class.
p51
aVAll right, we will discuss your concerns.
p52
aVJust relax. Nobody's died and gone to composting.
p53
aVOkay. After class. Okay? After class.
p54
aVLet's just get started, okay.
p55
aVThis first subject identified as a middle-class homemaker.
p56
aVRemember, these early modules
p57
aVin these people's full identities were protected,
p58
aVand this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic,
p59
aVwhich for many of them was taboo.
p60
aa(lp61
VOkay honey, now, I'm ready when you are.
p62
aVNo, sweetheart, I said, I'm ready when you are.
p63
aVI'm freezing.
p64
aVIt's like a meat locker in here in this recording studio.
p65
aVI should have brought a shmata.
p66
aVAll this fancy technology but they can't afford heat.
p67
aVWhat is he saying? I can't hear you!
p68
aVI can't hear you through the glass, honey!
p69
aVThere you are in my ear.
p70
aVOh, you can hear me?
p71
aVThe whole time.
p72
aVOh, yes, I am a little chilly.
p73
aVYes, oh the cold is for the machines, the new technology. Okay.
p74
aVYes, now remind me again, you're recording not only my voice but my feelings
p75
aVand my memories? Right.
p76
aVYes, BERT, yes, I read about it.
p77
aVBio-Empathetic Resonant Technology.
p78
aVRight, right, so people will be able to feel my experience
p79
aVand my memory? Okay.
p80
aVNo, right, I'm ready.
p81
aVI just thought you were going to give me a test to see how my memory's doing.
p82
aVI was going to tell you you're too late, it's already bad news.
p83
aVNo, no, go ahead, honey.
p84
aa(lp85
VOh, that's the first question?
p86
aVWhat do I think of prostitution?
p87
aVAre you soliciting me, young man?
p88
aVI've heard of May-December romances, but what are you, about 20 years old?
p89
aVEighteen? Eighteen years.
p90
aVI think I have candies in my purse older than 18 years old.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVI'm teasing you, sweetheart. No, I'm comfortable with any question.
p93
aVSure. So about the prostitution \u2014 oh, sex worker, sex worker.
p94
aVNo, just in my day, they called it prostitution, not sex work.
p95
aVOh, because it includes pornography also?
p96
aVOkay.
p97
aVNo, well, I guess when I was a girl,
p98
aVwe didn't really have a name for that either.
p99
aVWe would have said dirty magazines, I suppose, or dirty movies.
p100
aVWell, it's not like what you have with the Internet.
p101
aVNo, well, I don't mind sharing.
p102
aVMy late husband and I, we were a very romantic couple.
p103
aVLots of tenderness, you understand.
p104
aVWell, as you get older, you know, at one point I thought my husband
p105
aVmight be helped by using some of the pills men can take,
p106
aVbut he wasn't interested in those,
p107
aVso I thought, what about maybe watching an adult movie on the Internet?
p108
aVJust for inspiration, you understand.
p109
aVWell, at the time, neither of us were very good on the computer,
p110
aVso usually, if we needed help with the Internet,
p111
aVwe would just call our children or our grandchildren,
p112
aVbut obviously, in this case, that wasn't an option,
p113
aVso I thought, I'll have a look myself, just to see.
p114
aVHow difficult could it be?
p115
aVYou search for certain key words and you look \u2014
p116
aVOh wow is right, young man.
p117
aVYou can't imagine what I saw.
p118
aVWell, first of all, I was just trying to find, you know, couples,
p119
aVnormal couples making love,
p120
aVbut this, so many people together at one time.
p121
aVYou couldn't tell which part belonged to which body.
p122
aVHow they even got the cameras to capture some of this, I couldn't tell you.
p123
aVBut the one thing they didn't capture was making love.
p124
aVThere was lots of making of something,
p125
aVbut they took the love part right out of it, you know, the fun.
p126
aVIt was all very extreme, you know?
p127
aVLike you would say, with the extreme sports.
p128
aVLots of endurance,
p129
aVbut never tenderness.
p130
aVSo anyway, needless to say, that was $19.95 I'll never get back again,
p131
aVbut it only showed up on the credit card as "entertainment services,"
p132
aVso my husband was never the wiser,
p133
aVand after all of that,
p134
aVwell, you could say it turned out
p135
aVhe didn't need the extra inspiration after all.
p136
aa(lp137
VRight, so next subject is a young woman \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p138
aVNext subject, class, is a young woman called Bella,
p139
aVa university student interviewed in 2016
p140
aVduring what was called an Intro to Feminist Porn class
p141
aVas part of her major in sex work at a college in the Bay Area.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VYeah, I just want to, like, get a recording of, like,
p145
aVyou guys recording me,
p146
aVlike a meta recording, or whatever.
p147
aVIt's just like this whole experience is just, like, really amazing,
p148
aVand I'd like to capture that for, like, Instagram and my Tumblr.
p149
aVSo, like, hi guys, it's me, Bella,
p150
aVand I am, like, being interviewed right now
p151
aVfor this, like, really amazing Bio-Empathetic Resonance Technology,
p152
aVwhich is, like, basically where they are, like, recording, as you can see
p153
aVfrom these, whatever, like, electrodes,
p154
aVthe formation of, like, neuropeptides in my hippocampus, or whatever.
p155
aVThey will later be able to reconstitute these
p156
aVas, like, my own actual memory, like actual experiences,
p157
aVso other people can, like, actually feel what I'm feeling right now.
p158
aVOkay. Okay.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo, like, hello, BERT person of the future who is experiencing me.
p161
aVThis is what it feels like to be, like, a college freshman,
p162
aVand also the, like, headache that you are experiencing through me
p163
aVis the, like, residual effect of the Jell-O shots which I had last night
p164
aVat the bi-weekly feminist pole dancing party
p165
aVwhich I cohost on Wednesdays.
p166
aVIt's called "Don't Get All Pole-emical" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p167
aVand it's in Beekman Hall,
p168
aVand, what else, like,
p169
aVnon-Jell-O shots are also available for vegans,
p170
aVand, oh, okay, yeah, totally, yeah, we should also focus on your questions also.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo for your record, I am, like, a sex work studies major
p173
aVbut minoring in social media
p174
aVwith a concentration on notable YouTube memes.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVYes, well, of course, like, I consider myself to be, like,
p177
aVobviously, like, a feminist.
p178
aVI was named for Bella Abzug, who was, like, a famous, like,
p179
aVfeminist from history,
p180
aVand, like, also I feel that it is, like, important to, like, represent women
p181
aVwho are, like, sex-positive feminists.
p182
aVWhat is sex-negative?
p183
aVWell, like, I guess I would ask, like, what do you think
p184
aVsex-negative is? (Laughter)
p185
aVYeah, because, like, the terms that we use are, like, so important, because, like,
p186
aVwe call it sex work because it helps people understand that, like, it's work,
p187
aVand, like, you know, just like there are, like, healthcare providers
p188
aVand, like, insurance providers,
p189
aVlike, we think of these workers as, like, sex care providers.
p190
aVYeah, but like, I don't think of myself like, providing direct
p191
aVsex care services per se as, like, being a requirement
p192
aVfor me to be, like, an advocate.
p193
aVLike, I support other women's right to choose it voluntarily, like,
p194
aVif they enjoy it.
p195
aVYeah, but, like, I see myself going forward
p196
aVas more likely, like, protecting sex workers',
p197
aVlike, legal freedoms and rights.
p198
aVYeah, so, like, basically, I'm planning on becoming a lawyer.
p199
aa(lp200
VRight, class. (Laughter) (Applause)
p201
aVSo these next two modules are also circa 2016.
p202
aVOne subject is an Irishwoman with a particularly noteworthy
p203
aVrelationship to this issue,
p204
aVbut first will be a West Indian woman,
p205
aVa self-described escort
p206
aVwho was recorded at a sex workers' rights rally and parade.
p207
aVShe was interviewed whilst marching in full carnival headdress
p208
aVand very little else.
p209
aa(lp210
VAll right, you want me to start talking now.
p211
aVYeah, I told you, you can put those wires anywhere you want to
p212
aVas long as it don't get in the way.
p213
aVYeah, no, but, tell me again what the name of \u2014 BERT? BERT.
p214
aVYeah, I was telling you, you know, I think I have in all my time
p215
aVI have had at least one client with that name, so this won't be the first time
p216
aVI had BERT all over me.
p217
aVOh, I'm sorry,
p218
aVbut you got to get into the spirit of it if you're going to interview me.
p219
aVAll right? You can say it.
p220
aVNo justice, no piece! No justice, no piece!
p221
aVBut you see the sign? You get it? P-I-E-C-E. No justice, no piece of us.
p222
aVYou understand?
p223
aa(lp224
VRight, so that's the part where I was telling you
p225
aVis that when I first came to this country, I worked every job I could find.
p226
aVI was a nanny; I was a home care attendant for all these different old people,
p227
aVand then I said, child, if I have to touch another white man's backside,
p228
aVI might as well get paid a lot more money for it than this,
p229
aVyou understand?
p230
aVPshh, you know how hard it is being a domestic worker?
p231
aVSome of these men, they're heavy.
p232
aVYou have to pick them up and flip them over.
p233
aVNow, I let them pick me up and flip me over, you understand?
p234
aVWell, you have to have a sense of humor about it, that's what I think.
p235
aVNo, but see, listen,
p236
aVyou find me somebody who don't hate some part of their job.
p237
aVI mean, there's a lot of things about this job that I hate,
p238
aVbut the money is not one of them,
p239
aVand I will tell you, as long as this is the best possibility
p240
aVfor me to make real money,
p241
aVI am going to be Jamaican-No-Fakin' if that's what they want to call me.
p242
aVNo, I'm not even from Jamaica. That's how they market me.
p243
aVMy family is from Trinidad and the Virgin Islands.
p244
aVThey don't know what I do, but you know what?
p245
aVMy children, they know that their school fees are paid,
p246
aVthey have their books and their computer,
p247
aVand this way, I know that they have a chance.
p248
aVSo I'm not going to tell you that what I do, it's easy,
p249
aVI'm not going to tell you that I feel \u2014 what's that you said, liberated?
p250
aVBut I'm going to tell you that I feel paid.
p251
aVRight. (Applause)
p252
aa(lp253
VThanks, that's lovely, and just the cup of tea, love,
p254
aVand just a splash of the whiskey.
p255
aVIt's perfect, that's grand. Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect.
p256
aVWhat was your name? Peter? Is that right, so, Peter?
p257
aVRight. So that, that is the unique part of it for me,
p258
aVright, is that I ended up in both,
p259
aVfirst in the convent, and then in the prostitution after. That's right.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVSo one woman at the university here in Dublin, she wrote about me.
p262
aVShe said, Maureen Fitzroy is the living embodiment of the whore-virgin dichotomy.
p263
aVRight? (Laughter)
p264
aVDoesn't it sound like something you need to go into hospital?
p265
aVWell, I've got this terrible dichotomy.
p266
aVDoesn't it.
p267
aa(lp268
VRight. Well, for me though, it was, as a girl, it started with me dad.
p269
aVI mean, half the time, when he spoke to us, it was just a sort of
p270
aVtell us we were all useless rotten idiots and we had no morals, that type of thing.
p271
aVAnd I certainly didn't do myself any favors.
p272
aVBy the time I was 16,
p273
aVI had started messing about with this older fella,
p274
aVand he wanted it to be our little secret,
p275
aVand I did as I was told, didn't I,
p276
aVand when that got back to me dad, he had me sent straightaway to the convent.
p277
aVWell no, that older fella, he would still come to find me in the convent.
p278
aVYeah, he'd leave me notes
p279
aVtucked into the holes in the brick at the back of the charity shop
p280
aVso we could meet.
p281
aVAnd he'd tell me how he's leaving his wife,
p282
aVand I believed him, until I got pregnant.
p283
aVI did, Peter, and I left him a note about it in our special place there,
p284
aVand I never did hear from him again.
p285
aVNo, I gave it up for adoption so it could have a decent life,
p286
aVand then they wouldn't let me back into the convent.
p287
aa(lp288
VNo, my one sister Virginia gave me a fiver for the coach to Dublin,
p289
aVand that's how I ended up here.
p290
aVWell, surprise, surprise, I fell in love with another fella much older than me,
p291
aVand I always say I was just so happy because he didn't drink,
p292
aVI married the bastard.
p293
aa(lp294
VWell, he didn't drink, but he did have just the wee heroin problem, didn't he,
p295
aVand \u2014 That's right, and before I knew it,
p296
aVhe was the one who turned me on to the prostitution, my own husband.
p297
aVHe had me supporting the both of us.
p298
aVI was 18.
p299
aVWell, it wasn't Pretty Woman, I can tell you that.
p300
aVThat Julia Roberts,
p301
aVif she'd ever had to sleep with a man to put a few pounds in her pocket,
p302
aVI don't think she'd ever have made that film.
p303
aVWell, for your record,
p304
aVmy opinion of the legalization, I'd say I'm against it.
p305
aVI just, I don't care what these young girls say.
p306
aVYou know, living like that, you're just lost,
p307
aVand, you know, I'm 63 years old.
p308
aVI'm still trying to find who I am.
p309
aVYou know, I never was a wife or a nun,
p310
aVor a prostitute even, really, not really.
p311
aVNobody ever asked who I wanted to be.
p312
aVThey just told me,
p313
aVand if you legalize it,
p314
aVthen you're really telling these girls, "Go on and get lost for a living,"
p315
aVand a lot of them, they'll do as they're told.
p316
aa(lp317
VAll right, so four perspectives from four quite \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p318
aVfour quite different voices there, right?
p319
aVOne woman saying sex itself is natural but the sex industry seems to
p320
aVmechanize or industrialize it.
p321
aVThen the second woman considered sex work to be empowering,
p322
aVliberating, and feminist, though she, herself, notably,
p323
aVdid not seem keen to do it.
p324
aVThe third woman, who actually was a so-called sex worker
p325
aVdid not agree that it was liberating but she wanted the right
p326
aVto the economic empowerment,
p327
aVand then we hear the fourth woman saying not only prostitution itself
p328
aVbut proscribed roles for women in general
p329
aVprevented her from ever finding who she was, right?
p330
aa(lp331
VSo another fact most people did not know
p332
aVwas the average age of an at-risk girl being introduced to the sex industry
p333
aVwas 12 or 13.
p334
aa(lp335
VAlso consider that the age when all girls in that society
p336
aVfirst became exposed to sexualized images of women
p337
aVwas quite a bit earlier, right?
p338
aVThis was a doll called Barbie, right?
p339
aVI initially thought she was an educational tool for anorexia prevention \u2014
p340
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p341
aVbut actually she was considered by many
p342
aVto be a wholesome symbol of femininity,
p343
aVand often young girls began what was called dieting.
p344
aVRemember this? This was restricting food intake on purpose
p345
aVby the age of six,
p346
aVand defining themselves based on attractiveness
p347
aVby around that same time. Right?
p348
aa(lp349
VYes?
p350
aVRight, Bradley, okay, excellent point.
p351
aVSo there was a lucrative market in that society in convincing all people
p352
aVthey had to look a certain way to even have a sex life, right?
p353
aVBut girls, especially, were expected to be "sexy" while avoiding
p354
aVbeing perceived as "sluts" for being sexual. Right?
p355
aVSo there's that shame piece we've heard about.
p356
aa(lp357
VYes.
p358
aVValerie, right? Okay, very good.
p359
aVOf course, men were having sex as well,
p360
aVbut you'll remember from the reading,
p361
aVwhat were male sluts called?
p362
aVVery good, they were called men.
p363
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p364
aVSo not easy living in a world like that, right?
p365
aVThough it was not all bad news either.
p366
aVMost women in the early 2000s considered themselves empowered,
p367
aVand men generally felt they were also evolved in this area,
p368
aVand, in fact, most people would have been aware of issues
p369
aVlike human trafficking, for example,
p370
aVbut they would have seen that as quite separate
p371
aVfrom more recreational adult entertainment.
p372
aVAnd so we'll just very briefly, class \u2014 we don't have a lot of time \u2014
p373
aVwe'll just very briefly hear from a man
p374
aVon our topic at this stage.
p375
aVSo this next subject was interviewed on the night of his bachelor party.
p376
aa(lp377
VDude, can you, all right, can you just keep it down?
p378
aVI'm trying to talk to BERT right now.
p379
aVOh, your name's not BERT.
p380
aVBERT's the name of the, oh, all right.
p381
aVNo, no, no, totally, it's totally fine. I'm mostly sober,
p382
aVso I just want to be helpful.
p383
aVYeah, and I totally believe in causes, yeah, like, all that stuff.
p384
aV(Laughter)
p385
aVAnd actually, I'm wearing Toms right now.
p386
aVYeah, Toms, like, the shoes,
p387
aVlike, you buy a pair and then a kid in Africa gets clean water.
p388
aVYeah. Totally.
p389
aVBut what was the question again? Sorry.
p390
aa(lp391
VOf course I believe in women's rights. I'm marrying a woman.
p392
aV(Laughter)
p393
aVNo, but I mean, like, just because I'm in a strip club parking lot
p394
aVdoesn't mean that I'm, like, a sexist or whatever.
p395
aVMy fiancee is totally amazing, she's totally a strong girl, woman,
p396
aVsmart woman, like, the whole thing.
p397
aa(lp398
VYeah, she knows I'm here. She's probably at a strip club herself right now,
p399
aVlike, as a joke, same as me.
p400
aa(lp401
VMy best man, I told him he could surprise me,
p402
aVand he thought this would be hilarious,
p403
aVbut this is not something.
p404
aVYeah, we all went to B school together.
p405
aVWharton.
p406
aV(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
VYeah, so, dude, can you guys \u2014
p409
aVAll right, but it's my bachelor party,
p410
aVand I can spend it in the parking lot with Anderson Cooper if I want to.
p411
aVAll right, I'll see you in there.
p412
aa(lp413
VAll right, okay, so Anderson,
p414
aVso, like, first of all, stripping,
p415
aVbut then, like, all the other things you're talking about,
p416
aVprostitution and all that stuff, that's, like, not the same thing at all.
p417
aVYou know? Like, you keep calling it the sex industry or whatever,
p418
aVbut it's like, if the girl wants to be an exotic dancer
p419
aVand she's 18, like, that's her right.
p420
aa(lp421
VWhoa, whoa, I hear what you're saying, but I just feel like people,
p422
aVthey just want to make it seem like all dudes are just, like, predators,
p423
aVthat we would just automatically go to a prostitute, or whatever.
p424
aVEven, like, when I pledged, you know, like when I rushed my fraternity.
p425
aVMy brothers who I'm close to, those guys, they're all like me.
p426
aVWe're just normal people, but, like, there's this myth that you must
p427
aVbe that guy who is kind of an asshole, and like, all bros before hos or whatever.
p428
aVAnd actually, like, bros before hos, it doesn't mean like what it sounds like.
p429
aVIt's actually just like a joking way of saying that you care about your brothers
p430
aVand you put them first.
p431
aa(lp432
VYeah, but, you can't blame the media, either.
p433
aVI mean, like, if you go watch "Hangover 2,"
p434
aVand you think that's an instruction manual
p435
aVfor your life, like, I don't know what to tell you.
p436
aVYou know? You don't watch "Bourne Identity"
p437
aVand go drive your car over a gondola in Venice. (Laughter)
p438
aa(lp439
VWell, yeah, okay, like, if you're a little kid or whatever,
p440
aVof course it's different, but \u2014
p441
aa(lp442
VYeah, all right, I remember one thing like that.
p443
aVI was at this kid's house one time playing GTA,
p444
aVuh, Grand Theft Auto?
p445
aa(lp446
VDude, are you from Canada? (Laughter)
p447
aa(lp448
VSo, like, whatever, with Grand Theft Auto,
p449
aVyou're this kid, like, you're this guy walking around or whatever,
p450
aVand you can basically, like, the more cops you kill,
p451
aVthe more points you get, and stuff like that.
p452
aVBut also, you can find prostitutes
p453
aVand obviously you can do sexual stuff with them,
p454
aVbut you can, like, kill them and take your money back.
p455
aVYeah, this kid, I remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car
p456
aVand he got all these points.
p457
aVWe were, like, 10, I think.
p458
aVIt felt pretty terrible, actually.
p459
aVNo, I don't think I said anything, I just finished playing and went home.
p460
aa(lp461
VAll right class, so then there were men who had more than just
p462
aVa passing relationship to this issue. (Laughter)
p463
aVThe next subject described himself as a reformed and remorseful pimp
p464
aVturned motivational speaker,
p465
aVlife coach and therapist,
p466
aVbut if you want to know more about him, you'll have to come to the entire play.
p467
aa(lp468
VThank you so much, you beautiful TED audience.
p469
aVI will see you for "Sell/Buy/Date."

VI'm sure that, throughout the hundred-thousand-odd years
p5
aVof our species' existence,
p6
aVand even before,
p7
aVour ancestors looked up at the night sky,
p8
aVand wondered what stars are.
p9
aVWondering, therefore,
p10
aVhow to explain what they saw
p11
aVin terms of things unseen.
p12
aa(lp13
VOkay, so, most people
p14
aVonly wondered that occasionally, like today,
p15
aVin breaks from whatever
p16
aVnormally preoccupied them.
p17
aVBut what normally preoccupied them
p18
aValso involved yearning to know.
p19
aVThey wished they knew
p20
aVhow to prevent their food supply
p21
aVfrom sometimes failing,
p22
aVand how they could rest when they were tired
p23
aVwithout risking starvation,
p24
aVbe warmer, cooler, safer,
p25
aVin less pain.
p26
aVI bet those prehistoric cave artists
p27
aVwould have loved to know
p28
aVhow to draw better.
p29
aa(lp30
VIn every aspect of their lives,
p31
aVthey wished for progress, just as we do.
p32
aVBut they failed, almost completely, to make any.
p33
aVThey didn't know how to.
p34
aVDiscoveries like fire
p35
aVhappened so rarely, that from an individual's point of view,
p36
aVthe world never improved.
p37
aVNothing new was learned.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe first clue to the origin of starlight
p40
aVhappened as recently as 1899: radioactivity.
p41
aVWithin 40 years,
p42
aVphysicists discovered the whole explanation,
p43
aVexpressed, as usual, in elegant symbols.
p44
aVBut never mind the symbols.
p45
aVThink how many discoveries
p46
aVthey represent.
p47
aVNuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.
p48
aVBut isotopes, particles of electricity,
p49
aVantimatter,
p50
aVneutrinos,
p51
aVthe conversion of mass to energy \u2014 that's E=mc^2 \u2014
p52
aVgamma rays,
p53
aVtransmutation.
p54
aVThat ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists
p55
aVwas achieved through these same theories
p56
aVthat explained starlight
p57
aVand other ancient mysteries,
p58
aVand new, unexpected phenomena.
p59
aa(lp60
VThat all that, discovered in 40 years,
p61
aVhad not been in the previous hundred thousand,
p62
aVwas not for lack of thinking
p63
aVabout stars, and all those other urgent problems they had.
p64
aVThey even arrived at answers,
p65
aVsuch as myths,
p66
aVthat dominated their lives,
p67
aVyet bore almost no resemblance
p68
aVto the truth.
p69
aVThe tragedy of that protracted stagnation
p70
aVisn't sufficiently recognized, I think.
p71
aVThese were people with brains of
p72
aVessentially the same design
p73
aVthat eventually did discover all those things.
p74
aVBut that ability to make progress
p75
aVremained almost unused,
p76
aVuntil the event that
p77
aVrevolutionized the human condition
p78
aVand changed the universe.
p79
aa(lp80
VOr so we should hope.
p81
aVBecause that event was the
p82
aVScientific Revolution,
p83
aVever since which our knowledge
p84
aVof the physical world,
p85
aVand of how to adapt it to our wishes,
p86
aVhas been growing relentlessly.
p87
aVNow, what had changed?
p88
aVWhat were people now doing for the first time
p89
aVthat made that difference
p90
aVbetween stagnation
p91
aVand rapid, open-ended discovery?
p92
aVHow to make that difference
p93
aVis surely the most important universal truth
p94
aVthat it is possible to know.
p95
aVWorryingly, there is no consensus about what it is.
p96
aVSo, I'll tell you.
p97
aVBut I'll have to backtrack a little first.
p98
aa(lp99
VBefore the Scientific Revolution,
p100
aVthey believed that everything important, knowable,
p101
aVwas already known,
p102
aVenshrined in ancient writings, institutions,
p103
aVand in some genuinely useful rules of thumb \u2014
p104
aVwhich were, however, entrenched as dogmas,
p105
aValong with many falsehoods.
p106
aVSo they believed that knowledge came from authorities
p107
aVthat actually knew very little.
p108
aVAnd therefore progress
p109
aVdepended on learning how to reject
p110
aVthe authority of learned men,
p111
aVpriests, traditions and rulers.
p112
aVWhich is why the Scientific Revolution
p113
aVhad to have a wider context.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe Enlightenment, a revolution in how
p116
aVpeople sought knowledge,
p117
aVtrying not to rely on authority.
p118
aV"Take no one's word for it."
p119
aVBut that can't be what made the difference.
p120
aVAuthorities had been rejected before, many times.
p121
aVAnd that rarely, if ever,
p122
aVcaused anything like the Scientific Revolution.
p123
aVAt the time, what they thought
p124
aVdistinguished science
p125
aVwas a radical idea about things unseen,
p126
aVknown as empiricism.
p127
aVAll knowledge derives from the senses.
p128
aVWell, we've seen that that can't be true.
p129
aVIt did help by promoting
p130
aVobservation and experiment.
p131
aVBut, from the outset, it was obvious
p132
aVthat there was something horribly wrong with it.
p133
aa(lp134
VKnowledge comes from the senses.
p135
aVIn what language? Certainly not the language of mathematics,
p136
aVin which, Galileo rightly said,
p137
aVthe book of nature is written.
p138
aVLook at the world. You don't see equations
p139
aVcarved on to the mountainsides.
p140
aVIf you did, it would be because people
p141
aVhad carved them.
p142
aVBy the way, why don't we do that?
p143
aVWhat's wrong with us?
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VEmpiricism is inadequate
p147
aVbecause, well,
p148
aVscientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen.
p149
aVAnd the unseen, you have to admit,
p150
aVdoesn't come to us through the senses.
p151
aVWe don't see those nuclear reactions in stars.
p152
aVWe don't see the origin of species.
p153
aVWe don't see the curvature of space-time,
p154
aVand other universes.
p155
aVBut we know about those things.
p156
aVHow?
p157
aa(lp158
VWell, the classic empiricist answer is induction.
p159
aVThe unseen resembles the seen.
p160
aVBut it doesn't.
p161
aVYou know what the clinching evidence was
p162
aVthat space-time is curved?
p163
aVIt was a photograph, not of space-time,
p164
aVbut of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there.
p165
aVAnd the evidence for evolution?
p166
aVSome rocks and some finches.
p167
aVAnd parallel universes? Again: dots there,
p168
aVrather than there, on a screen.
p169
aVWhat we see, in all these cases,
p170
aVbears no resemblance to the reality
p171
aVthat we conclude is responsible \u2014
p172
aVonly a long chain of theoretical reasoning
p173
aVand interpretation connects them.
p174
aa(lp175
V"Ah!" say creationists.
p176
aV"So you admit it's all interpretation.
p177
aVNo one has ever seen evolution.
p178
aVWe see rocks.
p179
aVYou have your interpretation. We have ours.
p180
aVYours comes from guesswork,
p181
aVours from the Bible."
p182
aVBut what creationist and empiricists both ignore
p183
aVis that, in that sense,
p184
aVno one has ever seen a bible either,
p185
aVthat the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive.
p186
aVBrains only detect nerve impulses.
p187
aVAnd they don't perceive even those as what they really are,
p188
aVnamely electrical crackles.
p189
aVSo we perceive nothing as what it really is.
p190
aa(lp191
VOur connection to reality
p192
aVis never just perception.
p193
aVIt's always, as Karl Popper put it,
p194
aVtheory-laden.
p195
aVScientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.
p196
aVIt's like all knowledge. It's conjectural, guesswork,
p197
aVtested by observation,
p198
aVnot derived from it.
p199
aVSo, were testable conjectures
p200
aVthe great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates?
p201
aVNo. Contrary to what's usually said,
p202
aVtestability is common,
p203
aVin myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking.
p204
aVAny crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday
p205
aVhas got a testable prediction.
p206
aa(lp207
VConsider the ancient Greek myth
p208
aVexplaining seasons.
p209
aVHades, God of the Underworld,
p210
aVkidnaps Persephone, the Goddess of Spring,
p211
aVand negotiates a forced marriage contract,
p212
aVrequiring her to return regularly, and lets her go.
p213
aVAnd each year,
p214
aVshe is magically compelled to return.
p215
aVAnd her mother, Demeter,
p216
aVGoddess of the Earth,
p217
aVis sad, and makes it cold and barren.
p218
aVThat myth is testable.
p219
aVIf winter is caused by Demeter's sadness,
p220
aVthen it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously.
p221
aVSo if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia
p222
aVis at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest,
p223
aVthey'd have known that their theory is false.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo what was wrong with that myth,
p226
aVand with all pre-scientific thinking,
p227
aVand what, then, made that momentous difference?
p228
aVI think there is one thing you have to care about.
p229
aVAnd that implies
p230
aVtestability, the scientific method,
p231
aVthe Enlightenment, and everything.
p232
aVAnd here is the crucial thing.
p233
aVThere is such a thing as a defect in a story.
p234
aVI don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation.
p235
aVWhat does that mean? Well, explanation
p236
aVis an assertion about what's there, unseen,
p237
aVthat accounts for what's seen.
p238
aa(lp239
VBecause the explanatory role
p240
aVof Persephone's marriage contract
p241
aVcould be played equally well
p242
aVby infinitely many other
p243
aVad hoc entities.
p244
aVWhy a marriage contract and not any other reason
p245
aVfor regular annual action?
p246
aVHere is one. Persephone wasn't released.
p247
aVShe escaped, and returns every spring
p248
aVto take revenge on Hades,
p249
aVwith her Spring powers.
p250
aVShe cools his domain with Spring air,
p251
aVventing heat up to the surface, creating summer.
p252
aVThat accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth.
p253
aVIt's equally testable.
p254
aVYet what it asserts about reality
p255
aVis, in many ways, the opposite.
p256
aVAnd that is possible because
p257
aVthe details of the original myth
p258
aVare unrelated to seasons,
p259
aVexcept via the myth itself.
p260
aa(lp261
VThis easy variability
p262
aVis the sign of a bad explanation,
p263
aVbecause, without a functional reason to prefer
p264
aVone of countless variants,
p265
aVadvocating one of them, in preference to the others,
p266
aVis irrational.
p267
aVSo, for the essence of what
p268
aVmakes the difference to enable progress,
p269
aVseek good explanations,
p270
aVthe ones that can't be easily varied,
p271
aVwhile still explaining the phenomena.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow, our current explanation of seasons
p274
aVis that the Earth's axis is tilted like that,
p275
aVso each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year,
p276
aVand away for the other half.
p277
aVBetter put that up.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aVThat's a good explanation: hard to vary,
p280
aVbecause every detail plays a functional role.
p281
aVFor instance, we know, independently of seasons,
p282
aVthat surfaces tilted away
p283
aVfrom radiant heat are heated less,
p284
aVand that a spinning sphere, in space,
p285
aVpoints in a constant direction.
p286
aVAnd the tilt also explains
p287
aVthe sun's angle of elevation at different times of year,
p288
aVand predicts that the seasons
p289
aVwill be out of phase in the two hemispheres.
p290
aVIf they'd been observed in phase,
p291
aVthe theory would have been refuted.
p292
aVBut now, the fact that it's also a good explanation,
p293
aVhard to vary, makes the crucial difference.
p294
aa(lp295
VIf the ancient Greeks had found out
p296
aVabout seasons in Australia,
p297
aVthey could have easily varied their myth
p298
aVto predict that.
p299
aVFor instance, when Demeter is upset,
p300
aVshe banishes heat from her vicinity,
p301
aVinto the other hemisphere, where it makes summer.
p302
aVSo, being proved wrong by observation,
p303
aVand changing their theory accordingly,
p304
aVstill wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks
p305
aVone jot closer to understanding seasons,
p306
aVbecause their explanation was bad: easy to vary.
p307
aVAnd it's only when an explanation is good
p308
aVthat it even matters whether it's testable.
p309
aVIf the axis-tilt theory had been refuted,
p310
aVits defenders would have had nowhere to go.
p311
aVNo easily implemented change
p312
aVcould make that tilt
p313
aVcause the same seasons in both hemispheres.
p314
aa(lp315
VThe search for hard-to-vary explanations
p316
aVis the origin of all progress.
p317
aVIt's the basic regulating principle
p318
aVof the Enlightenment.
p319
aVSo, in science, two false approaches blight progress.
p320
aVOne is well known: untestable theories.
p321
aVBut the more important one is explanationless theories.
p322
aVWhenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue,
p323
aVbut you aren't given a hard-to-vary account
p324
aVof what causes that trend,
p325
aVyou're being told a wizard did it.
p326
aa(lp327
VWhen you are told that carrots have human rights
p328
aVbecause they share half our genes \u2014
p329
aVbut not how gene percentages confer rights \u2014 wizard.
p330
aVWhen someone announces that the nature-nurture debate
p331
aVhas been settled because there is evidence
p332
aVthat a given percentage of our
p333
aVpolitical opinions are genetically inherited,
p334
aVbut they don't explain how genes cause opinions,
p335
aVthey've settled nothing. They are saying that our
p336
aVopinions are caused by wizards,
p337
aVand presumably so are their own.
p338
aVThat the truth consists of
p339
aVhard to vary assertions about reality
p340
aVis the most important fact
p341
aVabout the physical world.
p342
aVIt's a fact that is, itself, unseen,
p343
aVyet impossible to vary. Thank you.
p344
aV(Applause)

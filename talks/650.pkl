VHow do you feed a city?
p5
aVIt's one of the great questions of our time.
p6
aVYet it's one that's rarely asked.
p7
aVWe take it for granted that if we go into a shop
p8
aVor restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time,
p9
aVthere is going to be food there waiting for us,
p10
aVhaving magically come from somewhere.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut when you think that every day for a city the size of London,
p13
aVenough food has to be produced,
p14
aVtransported, bought and sold,
p15
aVcooked, eaten, disposed of,
p16
aVand that something similar has to happen every day
p17
aVfor every city on earth,
p18
aVit's remarkable that cities get fed at all.
p19
aa(lp20
VWe live in places like this as if
p21
aVthey're the most natural things in the world,
p22
aVforgetting that because we're animals
p23
aVand that we need to eat,
p24
aVwe're actually as dependent on the natural world
p25
aVas our ancient ancestors were.
p26
aVAnd as more of us move into cities,
p27
aVmore of that natural world is being
p28
aVtransformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me \u2014
p29
aVit's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil \u2014
p30
aVin order to feed us.
p31
aVThese are extraordinary landscapes,
p32
aVbut few of us ever get to see them.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd increasingly these landscapes
p35
aVare not just feeding us either.
p36
aVAs more of us move into cities,
p37
aVmore of us are eating meat,
p38
aVso that a third of the annual grain crop globally
p39
aVnow gets fed to animals
p40
aVrather than to us human animals.
p41
aVAnd given that it takes three times as much grain \u2014
p42
aVactually ten times as much grain \u2014
p43
aVto feed a human if it's passed through an animal first,
p44
aVthat's not a very efficient way of feeding us.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd it's an escalating problem too.
p47
aVBy 2050, it's estimated that twice the number
p48
aVof us are going to be living in cities.
p49
aVAnd it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much
p50
aVmeat and dairy consumed.
p51
aVSo meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.
p52
aVAnd that's going to pose an enormous problem.
p53
aVSix billion hungry carnivores to feed,
p54
aVby 2050.
p55
aVThat's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are,
p56
aVit's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.
p57
aa(lp58
VNineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year
p59
aVto create new arable land.
p60
aVAlthough at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount
p61
aVof existing arables to salinization and erosion.
p62
aVWe're very hungry for fossil fuels too.
p63
aVIt takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie
p64
aVof food that we consume in the West.
p65
aVAnd even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,
p66
aVwe don't actually value it.
p67
aVHalf the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.
p68
aVAnd to end all of this, at the end of this long process,
p69
aVwe're not even managing to feed the planet properly.
p70
aVA billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.
p71
aVNone of it makes very much sense.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now
p74
aVis controlled by just five multinational corporations,
p75
aVit's a grim picture.
p76
aVAs we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
p77
aVAnd if we look to the future,
p78
aVit's an unsustainable diet.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo how did we get here?
p81
aVAnd more importantly, what are we going to do about it?
p82
aVWell, to answer the slightly easier question first,
p83
aVabout 10,000 years ago, I would say,
p84
aVis the beginning of this process
p85
aVin the ancient Near East,
p86
aVknown as the Fertile Crescent.
p87
aVBecause, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.
p88
aVAnd it was also fertile.
p89
aVAnd it was here, about 10,000 years ago,
p90
aVthat two extraordinary inventions,
p91
aVagriculture and urbanism, happened
p92
aVroughly in the same place and at the same time.
p93
aa(lp94
VThis is no accident,
p95
aVbecause agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.
p96
aVBecause it was discovery of grain
p97
aVby our ancient ancestors for the first time
p98
aVthat produced a food source that was large enough
p99
aVand stable enough to support permanent settlements.
p100
aVAnd if we look at what those settlements were like,
p101
aVwe see they were compact.
p102
aVThey were surrounded by productive farm land
p103
aVand dominated by large temple complexes
p104
aVlike this one at Ur,
p105
aVthat were, in fact, effectively,
p106
aVspiritualized, central food distribution centers.
p107
aa(lp108
VBecause it was the temples that organized the harvest,
p109
aVgathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,
p110
aVand then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.
p111
aVSo, if you like,
p112
aVthe whole spiritual and physical life of these cities
p113
aVwas dominated by the grain and the harvest
p114
aVthat sustained them.
p115
aVAnd in fact, that's true of every ancient city.
p116
aVBut of course not all of them were that small.
p117
aVFamously, Rome had about a million citizens
p118
aVby the first century A.D.
p119
aVSo how did a city like this feed itself?
p120
aVThe answer is what I call "ancient food miles."
p121
aa(lp122
VBasically, Rome had access to the sea,
p123
aVwhich made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.
p124
aVThis is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,
p125
aVbecause it was very difficult to transport food over roads,
p126
aVwhich were rough.
p127
aVAnd the food obviously went off very quickly.
p128
aVSo Rome effectively waged war
p129
aVon places like Carthage and Egypt
p130
aVjust to get its paws on their grain reserves.
p131
aVAnd, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire
p132
aVwas really sort of one long, drawn out
p133
aVmilitarized shopping spree, really.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVIn fact \u2014 I love the fact, I just have to mention this:
p136
aVRome in fact used to import oysters from London,
p137
aVat one stage. I think that's extraordinary.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo Rome shaped its hinterland
p140
aVthrough its appetite.
p141
aVBut the interesting thing is that the other thing also
p142
aVhappened in the pre-industrial world.
p143
aVIf we look at a map of London in the 17th century,
p144
aVwe can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,
p145
aValong the bottom of this map.
p146
aVSo the grain markets were to the south of the city.
p147
aVAnd the roads leading up from them
p148
aVto Cheapside, which was the main market,
p149
aVwere also grain markets.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd if you look at the name of one of those streets,
p152
aVBread Street, you can tell
p153
aVwhat was going on there 300 years ago.
p154
aVAnd the same of course was true for fish.
p155
aVFish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.
p156
aVAnd of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,
p157
aVoperating on-site here until the mid-1980s.
p158
aVWhich is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.
p159
aVEverybody else was wandering around
p160
aVwith mobile phones that looked like bricks
p161
aVand sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.
p162
aa(lp163
VThis is another thing about food in cities:
p164
aVOnce its roots into the city are established,
p165
aVthey very rarely move.
p166
aVMeat is a very different story
p167
aVbecause, of course, animals could walk into the city.
p168
aVSo much of London's meat
p169
aVwas coming from the northwest,
p170
aVfrom Scotland and Wales.
p171
aVSo it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,
p172
aVwhich is why Smithfield,
p173
aVLondon's very famous meat market, was located up there.
p174
aVPoultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
p175
aVI feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,
p176
aVand so the birds were coming in
p177
aVwith their feet protected with little canvas shoes.
p178
aVAnd then when they hit the eastern end
p179
aVof Cheapside, that's where they were sold,
p180
aVwhich is why it's called Poultry.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd, in fact, if you look at the map of any city
p183
aVbuilt before the industrial age,
p184
aVyou can trace food coming in to it.
p185
aVYou can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,
p186
aVboth by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.
p187
aVFriday Street, in a previous life,
p188
aVis where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
p189
aVBut also you have to imagine it full of food.
p190
aVBecause the streets and the public spaces
p191
aVwere the only places where food was bought and sold.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830
p194
aVyou can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this
p195
aVand be unaware of where your food came from.
p196
aVIn fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,
p197
aVthe chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window
p198
aVabout three days earlier.
p199
aVSo this was obviously an organic city,
p200
aVpart of an organic cycle.
p201
aVAnd then 10 years later everything changed.
p202
aa(lp203
VThis is an image of the Great Western in 1840.
p204
aVAnd as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers
p205
aVwere pigs and sheep.
p206
aVSo all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.
p207
aVThey're being slaughtered out of sight and mind,
p208
aVsomewhere in the countryside.
p209
aVAnd they're coming into the city by rail.
p210
aVAnd this changes everything.
p211
aVTo start off with, it makes it possible
p212
aVfor the first time to grow cities,
p213
aVreally any size and shape, in any place.
p214
aVCities used to be constrained by geography;
p215
aVthey used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.
p216
aVAll of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd as you can see from these maps of London,
p219
aVin the 90 years after the trains came,
p220
aVit goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed
p221
aVby animals coming in on foot, and so on,
p222
aVto a large splurge,
p223
aVthat would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,
p224
aVeither animals or people.
p225
aVAnd of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,
p226
aVand really this marks the end of this process.
p227
aVIt's the final emancipation of the city
p228
aVfrom any apparent relationship with nature at all.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell,
p231
aVdevoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,
p232
aVbecause nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.
p233
aVIn fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,
p234
aVdrove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,
p235
aVcame back with a week's worth of shopping,
p236
aVand wondered what on earth to do with it.
p237
aVAnd this really is the moment when our relationship,
p238
aVboth with food and cities, changes completely.
p239
aa(lp240
VHere we have food \u2014 that used to be the center,
p241
aVthe social core of the city \u2014 at the periphery.
p242
aVIt used to be a social event, buying and selling food.
p243
aVNow it's anonymous.
p244
aVWe used to cook; now we just add water,
p245
aVor a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
p246
aVWe don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
p247
aVWe just read the back of a label on a packet.
p248
aVAnd we don't value food. We don't trust it.
p249
aVSo instead of trusting it, we fear it.
p250
aVAnd instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
p251
aa(lp252
VOne of the great ironies of modern food systems
p253
aVis that they've made the very thing they promised
p254
aVto make easier much harder.
p255
aVBy making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,
p256
aVthey've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,
p257
aVwhich is that of us and nature.
p258
aVAnd also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,
p259
aVthat, as we've seen, are unsustainable.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo what are we going to do about that?
p262
aVIt's not a new question.
p263
aV500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.
p264
aVThis is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."
p265
aVAnd it was a series of semi-independent city-states,
p266
aVif that sounds remotely familiar,
p267
aVa day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,
p268
aVand grew vegetables in their back gardens,
p269
aVand ate communal meals together, and so on.
p270
aVAnd I think you could argue that
p271
aVfood is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,
p272
aVeven though More never framed it that way.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd here is another very famous "Utopian" vision,
p275
aVthat of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."
p276
aVSame idea: series of semi-independent city-states,
p277
aVlittle blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,
p278
aVjoined to one another by railway.
p279
aVAnd again, food could be said to be
p280
aVthe ordering principle of his vision.
p281
aVIt even got built, but nothing to do with
p282
aVthis vision that Howard had.
p283
aVAnd that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,
p284
aVthat they are Utopian.
p285
aa(lp286
VUtopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.
p287
aVIt was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.
p288
aVIt can either mean a good place, or no place.
p289
aVBecause it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.
p290
aVAnd I think, as a conceptual tool
p291
aVfor thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,
p292
aVthat makes it not much use.
p293
aVSo I've come up with an alternative,
p294
aVwhich is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,
p295
aV"sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.
p296
aa(lp297
VI believe we already live in Sitopia.
p298
aVWe live in a world shaped by food,
p299
aVand if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool \u2014
p300
aVa conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.
p301
aVSo if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?
p302
aVWell I think it looks a bit like this.
p303
aVI have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
p304
aVBut anyway, this is \u2014 (Laughter)
p305
aVit's food at the center of life,
p306
aVat the center of family life, being celebrated,
p307
aVbeing enjoyed, people taking time for it.
p308
aVThis is where food should be in our society.
p309
aa(lp310
VBut you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.
p311
aVBy the way, these can be men as well.
p312
aVIt's people who think about food,
p313
aVwho think ahead, who plan,
p314
aVwho can stare at a pile of raw vegetables
p315
aVand actually recognize them.
p316
aVWe need these people. We're part of a network.
p317
aVBecause without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.
p318
aVHere, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.
p319
aVBut networks, markets where food is being grown locally.
p320
aVIt's common. It's fresh.
p321
aVIt's part of the social life of the city.
p322
aVBecause without that, you can't have this kind of place,
p323
aVfood that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,
p324
aVand is not just a zero-sum commodity
p325
aVoff in some unseen hell-hole.
p326
aVCows with a view.
p327
aVSteaming piles of humus.
p328
aVThis is basically bringing the whole thing together.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd this is a community project
p331
aVI visited recently in Toronto.
p332
aVIt's a greenhouse, where kids get told
p333
aVall about food and growing their own food.
p334
aVHere is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a
p335
aVplant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
p336
aVBut anyway, these kinds of projects
p337
aVthat are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.
p340
aVIt's basically recognizing that Sitopia
p341
aValready exists in little pockets everywhere.
p342
aVThe trick is to join them up,
p343
aVto use food as a way of seeing.
p344
aVAnd if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities
p345
aVas big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.
p346
aVWe're going to see them more like this,
p347
aVas part of the productive, organic framework
p348
aVof which they are inevitably a part,
p349
aVsymbiotically connected.
p350
aVBut of course, that's not a great image either,
p351
aVbecause we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
p352
aVWe need to be thinking more about permaculture,
p353
aVwhich is why I think this image just
p354
aVsums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
p355
aVIt's a re-conceptualization
p356
aVof the way food shapes our lives.
p357
aa(lp358
VThe best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
p359
aVIt's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
p360
aVIt's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
p361
aVAnd I think the message of this is very clear.
p362
aVIf the city looks after the country,
p363
aVthe country will look after the city.
p364
aVAnd I want us to ask now,
p365
aVwhat would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint
p366
aVif he painted this image today?
p367
aVWhat would an allegory of good government look like today?
p368
aVBecause I think it's an urgent question.
p369
aVIt's one we have to ask,
p370
aVand we have to start answering.
p371
aVWe know we are what we eat.
p372
aVWe need to realize that the world is also what we eat.
p373
aVBut if we take that idea, we can use food
p374
aVas a really powerful tool to shape the world better.
p375
aVThank you very much.
p376
aV(Applause)

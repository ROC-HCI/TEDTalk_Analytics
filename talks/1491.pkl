VSo a few weeks ago, a friend
p5
aVof mine gave this toy car to his
p6
aV8-year-old son.
p7
aVBut instead of going into a store and buying one,
p8
aVlike we do normally, he went to this
p9
aVwebsite and he downloaded
p10
aVa file, and then he printed it
p11
aVon this printer.
p12
aVSo this idea that you can
p13
aVmanufacture objects
p14
aVdigitally using these machines
p15
aVis something that The Economist magazine
p16
aVdefined as the Third Industrial Revolution.
p17
aa(lp18
VActually, I argue that there is another revolution
p19
aVgoing on, and it's the one that has to do with
p20
aVopen-source hardware and the maker's movement,
p21
aVbecause the printer that my friend used
p22
aVto print the toy is actually open-source.
p23
aVSo you go to the same website, you can download all the files
p24
aVthat you need in order to make that printer:
p25
aVthe construction files, the hardware, the software,
p26
aVall the instruction is there.
p27
aVAnd also this is part of a large
p28
aVcommunity where there are thousands of people
p29
aVaround the world that are actually
p30
aVmaking these kinds of printers,
p31
aVand there's a lot of innovation
p32
aVhappening because it's all open-source.
p33
aVYou don't need anybody's permission to create something great.
p34
aVAnd that space is like
p35
aVthe personal computer in 1976,
p36
aVlike the Apples with the other companies are fighting,
p37
aVand we will see in a few years,
p38
aVthere will be the Apple of this kind of market come out.
p39
aa(lp40
VWell, there's also another interesting thing.
p41
aVI said the electronics are open-source, because at the heart
p42
aVof this printer there is something I'm really attached to:
p43
aVthese Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of
p44
aVpowers this printer, is a project
p45
aVI've been working on for the past seven years.
p46
aVIt's an open-source project.
p47
aVI worked with these friends of mine that I have here.
p48
aVSo the five of us, two Americans, two Italians
p49
aVand a Spaniard, we \u2014 (Laughter)
p50
aVYou know, it's a worldwide project. (Laughter)
p51
aVSo we came together in this
p52
aVdesign institute called the Interaction Design Institute
p53
aVIvrea, which was teaching
p54
aVinteraction design, this idea that you can take
p55
aVdesign from the simple shape
p56
aVof an object and you can move it
p57
aVforward to design the way you interact with things.
p58
aVWell, when you design an object that's supposed to interact
p59
aVwith a human being, if you make a foam model
p60
aVof a mobile phone, it doesn't make any sense.
p61
aVYou have to have something that
p62
aVactually interacts with people.
p63
aVSo, we worked on Arduino and
p64
aVa lot of other projects there to
p65
aVcreate platforms that would be
p66
aVsimple for our students to use,
p67
aVso that our students could just build things that worked,
p68
aVbut they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo how do I make something that even a kid can use?
p71
aVAnd actually, with Arduino,
p72
aVwe have kids like Sylvia that you see here,
p73
aVthat actually make projects with Arduino.
p74
aVI have 11-year-old kids stop me and show me
p75
aVstuff they built for Arduino that's really
p76
aVscary to see the capabilities
p77
aVthat kids have when you give them the tools.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo let's look at what happens when you make a tool
p80
aVthat anybody can just pick up and build something quickly,
p81
aVso one of the examples that I like to sort of
p82
aVkick off this discussion is this
p83
aVexample of this cat feeder.
p84
aVThe gentleman who made this project had two cats.
p85
aVOne was sick and the other one
p86
aVwas healthy, so he had to make
p87
aVsure they ate the proper food.
p88
aVSo he made this thing that recognizes the cat
p89
aVfrom a chip mounted inside
p90
aVon the collar of the cat, and opens the door
p91
aVand the cat can eat the food.
p92
aVThis is made by recycling an old CD player
p93
aVthat you can get from an old computer,
p94
aVsome cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs,
p95
aVand then suddenly you have a tool. You build something
p96
aVthat you cannot find on the market.
p97
aVAnd I like this phrase: "Scratch your own itch."
p98
aVIf you have an idea, you just go and you make it.
p99
aVThis is the equivalent of sketching on paper
p100
aVdone with electronics.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo one of the features that I
p103
aVthink is important about our work
p104
aVis that our hardware, on top of
p105
aVbeing made with love in Italy \u2014
p106
aVas you can see from the
p107
aVback of the circuit \u2014 (Laughter)
p108
aVis that it's open,
p109
aVso we publish all the design
p110
aVfiles for the circuit online,
p111
aVso you can download it and
p112
aVyou can actually use it to
p113
aVmake something, or to modify, to learn.
p114
aVYou know, when I was learning about programming,
p115
aVI learned by looking at other people's code,
p116
aVor looking at other people's circuits in magazines.
p117
aVAnd this is a good way to learn,
p118
aVby looking at other people's work.
p119
aVSo the different elements of the project are all open,
p120
aVso the hardware is released
p121
aVwith a Creative Commons license.
p122
aVSo, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes
p123
aVlike a piece of culture that you share
p124
aVand you build upon, like it was
p125
aVa song or a poem with Creative Commons.
p126
aVOr, the software is GPL, so it's open-source as well.
p127
aVThe documentation and the hands-on teaching
p128
aVmethodology is also open-source and released as the Creative Commons.
p129
aVJust the name is protected so
p130
aVthat we can make sure that we can tell people
p131
aVwhat is Arduino and what isn't.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, Arduino itself is made of
p134
aVa lot of different open-source components
p135
aVthat maybe individually are hard to use for
p136
aVa 12-year-old kid, so Arduino
p137
aVwraps everything together into
p138
aVa mashup of open-source technologies
p139
aVwhere we try to give them the
p140
aVbest user experience to get something done quickly.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo you have situations like this,
p143
aVwhere some people in Chile
p144
aVdecided to make their own boards instead of buying them,
p145
aVto organize a workshop and
p146
aVto save money. Or there are
p147
aVcompanies that make their own
p148
aVvariations of Arduino that fit
p149
aVin a certain market, and there's
p150
aVprobably, maybe like a 150 of them
p151
aVor something at the moment.
p152
aVThis one is made by a company
p153
aVcalled Adafruit, which is run by
p154
aVthis woman called Limor Fried,
p155
aValso known as Ladyada, who is
p156
aVone of the heroes of the open-source hardware movement
p157
aVand the maker movement.
p158
aVSo, this idea that you have a new, sort of
p159
aVturbo-charged DIY community
p160
aVthat believes in open-source,
p161
aVin collaboration, collaborates
p162
aVonline, collaborates in different spaces.
p163
aVThere is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered
p164
aVall these people and sort of put them together
p165
aVas a community, and you see
p166
aVa very technical project explained in a
p167
aVvery simple language, beautifully typeset.
p168
aVOr you have websites,
p169
aVlike this one, like Instructables,
p170
aVwhere people actually teach each other about anything.
p171
aVSo this one is about Arduino projects,
p172
aVthe page you see on the screen, but effectively here you can
p173
aVlearn how to make a cake and everything else.
p174
aVSo let's look at some projects.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo this one is a quadcopter.
p177
aVIt's a small model helicopter.
p178
aVIn a way, it's a toy, no?
p179
aVAnd so this one was military technology
p180
aVa few years ago, and now it's
p181
aVopen-source, easy to use, you can buy it online.
p182
aVDIY Drones is the community; they do this thing called ArduCopter.
p183
aVBut then somebody actually launched this start-up called
p184
aVMatternet, where they figured out that you could
p185
aVuse this to actually transport
p186
aVthings from one village to another in Africa,
p187
aVand the fact that this was easy to find,
p188
aVopen-source, easy to hack, enabled them
p189
aVto prototype their company really quickly.
p190
aVOr, other projects. Matt Richardson: I'm getting a little sick
p191
aVof hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over
p192
aVagain, so I decided to do something about it.
p193
aVThis Arduino project,
p194
aVwhich I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime
p195
aVany of these over-exposed
p196
aVpersonalities is mentioned. (Laughter)
p197
aVI'll show you how I made it. (Applause)
p198
aVMB: Check this out.
p199
aVMR: Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier
p200
aVtoday to find out what she was planning on wearing to her \u2014
p201
aVMB: Eh? (Laughter)
p202
aVMR: It should do a pretty good
p203
aVjob of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details
p204
aVof Kim Kardashian's wedding.
p205
aVMB: Okay. So, you know, again, what is interesting here
p206
aVis that Matt found this module
p207
aVthat lets Arduino process
p208
aVTV signals, he found some code
p209
aVwritten by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV,
p210
aVput it together and then created this great project.
p211
aa(lp212
VIt's also used, Arduino's used,
p213
aVin serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider.
p214
aVThere's some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of
p215
aVmeasuring some parameters.
p216
aVOr it's used for \u2014
p217
aV(Music)
p218
aVSo this is a musical interface
p219
aVbuilt by a student from Italy,
p220
aVand he's now turning this into
p221
aVa product. Because it was a
p222
aVstudent project becoming a product.
p223
aVOr it can be used to make an assistive device.
p224
aVThis is a glove that understands
p225
aVthe sign language and transforms
p226
aVthe gestures you make into sounds
p227
aVand writes the words that you're signing on a display
p228
aVAnd again, this is made of all different parts you can find
p229
aVon all the websites that sell Arduino-compatible parts,
p230
aVand you assemble it into a project.
p231
aVOr this is a project from the ITP part of NYU,
p232
aVwhere they met with this boy
p233
aVwho has a severe disability, cannot play with the PS3,
p234
aVso they built this device that
p235
aVallows the kid to play baseball
p236
aValthough he has limited
p237
aVmovement capability.
p238
aa(lp239
VOr you can find it in arts projects.
p240
aVSo this is the txtBomber.
p241
aVSo you put a message into this device
p242
aVand then you roll it on the wall, and it basically
p243
aVhas all these solenoids
p244
aVpressing the buttons on spray cans,
p245
aVso you just pull it over a wall
p246
aVand it just writes on the wall
p247
aVall the political messages.
p248
aVSo, yeah. (Applause)
p249
aVThen we have this plant here.
p250
aVThis is called Botanicalls,
p251
aVbecause there's an Arduino ball with a Wi-Fi module
p252
aVin the plant, and it's measuring
p253
aVthe well-being of the plant,
p254
aVand it's creating a Twitter account
p255
aVwhere you can actually interact with the plant. (Laughter)
p256
aVSo, you know, this plant
p257
aVwill start to say, "This is really hot," or
p258
aVthere's a lot of, you know, "I need water right now." (Laughter)
p259
aVSo it just gives a personality to your plant.
p260
aVOr this is something that twitters when the
p261
aVbaby inside the belly of a
p262
aVpregnant woman kicks. (Laughter)
p263
aVOr this is a 14-year-old kid in
p264
aVChile who made a system that
p265
aVdetects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter.
p266
aVHe has 280,000 followers.
p267
aVHe's 14 and he anticipated
p268
aVa governmental project by one year. (Applause)
p269
aVOr again, another project where,
p270
aVby analyzing the Twitter feed
p271
aVof a family, you can basically
p272
aVpoint where they are, like in the "Harry Potter" movie.
p273
aVSo you can find out everything about this project on the website.
p274
aVOr somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts. (Laughter)
p275
aVIt's interesting how, in 2009,
p276
aVGizmodo basically defined,
p277
aVsaid that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter,
p278
aVso it was \u2014 a lot changed in between. (Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VSo very serious project.
p281
aVWhen the Fukushima disaster happened,
p282
aVa bunch of people in Japan, they realized that the information
p283
aVthat the government was giving wasn't really open
p284
aVand really reliable, so they built
p285
aVthis Geiger counter, plus Arduino, plus network
p286
aVinterface. They made 100
p287
aVof them and gave them to people around Japan, and essentially
p288
aVthe data that they gathered gets published on this website
p289
aVcalled Cosm, another website
p290
aVthey built, so you can actually get reliable real-time
p291
aVinformation from the field,
p292
aVand you can get unbiased information.
p293
aVOr this machine here, it's from
p294
aVthe DIY bio movement,
p295
aVand it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA,
p296
aVand again, it's completely open-source from the ground up.
p297
aVOr you have students in developing countries making
p298
aVreplicas of scientific instruments that cost
p299
aVa lot of money to make.
p300
aVActually they just build them themselves for a lot less
p301
aVusing Arduino and a few parts.
p302
aVThis is a pH probe.
p303
aVOr you get kids, like these kids, they're from Spain.
p304
aVThey learned how to program and to make robots when they
p305
aVwere probably, like, 11, and then they started to use Arduino
p306
aVto make these robots that play football. They became
p307
aVworld champions by making an Arduino-based robot.
p308
aVAnd so when we had to make
p309
aVour own educational robot, we just went to them and said,
p310
aVyou know, "You design it, because you know exactly
p311
aVwhat is needed to make a great robot that excites kids."
p312
aVNot me. I'm an old guy.
p313
aVWhat am I supposed to excite, huh? (Laughter)
p314
aVBut as I \u2014 in terms of educational assets. (Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VThere's also companies like Google
p317
aVthat are using the technology
p318
aVto create interfaces between
p319
aVmobile phones, tablets and the real world.
p320
aVSo the Accessory Development Kit
p321
aVfrom Google is open-source
p322
aVand based on Arduino, as opposed
p323
aVto the one from Apple which is
p324
aVclosed-source, NDA, sign your
p325
aVlife to Apple. Here you are.
p326
aVThere's a giant maze, and Joey's sitting there, and the
p327
aVmaze is moving when you tilt the tablet.
p328
aa(lp329
VAlso, I come from Italy, and the design is important
p330
aVin Italy, and yet very conservative.
p331
aVSo we worked with a design
p332
aVstudio called Habits, in Milan,
p333
aVto make this mirror, which is completely open-source.
p334
aVThis doubles also as an iPod speaker.
p335
aVSo the idea is that the hardware, the software,
p336
aVthe design of the object, the fabrication,
p337
aVeverything about this project is open-source
p338
aVand you can make it yourself.
p339
aVSo we want other designers to pick this up and learn how
p340
aVto make great devices, to learn
p341
aVhow to make interactive products
p342
aVby starting from something real.
p343
aa(lp344
VBut when you have this idea,
p345
aVyou know, what happens to all these ideas?
p346
aVThere's, like, thousands of ideas that I \u2014
p347
aVYou know, it would take seven hours for me to do
p348
aVall the presentations.
p349
aVI will not take all the seven hours. Thank you.
p350
aVBut let's start from this example:
p351
aVSo, the group of people
p352
aVthat started this company called Pebble, they prototyped
p353
aVa watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone,
p354
aVand you can display information
p355
aVon it. And they prototyped with
p356
aVan old LCD screen from a Nokia
p357
aVmobile phone and an Arduino.
p358
aVAnd then, when they had a final
p359
aVproject, they actually went to Kickstarter
p360
aVand they were asking for 100,000 dollars to make
p361
aVa few of them to sell.
p362
aVThey got 10 million dollars.
p363
aVThey got a completely
p364
aVfully funded start-up, and they don't have to,
p365
aVyou know, get VCs involved or anything,
p366
aVjust excite the people with their great project.
p367
aa(lp368
VThe last project I want to show you is this:
p369
aVIt's called ArduSat. It's currently on Kickstarter,
p370
aVso if you want to contribute, please do it.
p371
aVIt's a satellite that goes into space, which is probably
p372
aVthe least open-source thing you can imagine,
p373
aVand it contains an Arduino
p374
aVconnected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino,
p375
aVyou can actually upload your experiments
p376
aVinto this satellite and run them.
p377
aVSo imagine, if you as a high school can have the satellite
p378
aVfor a week and do satellite
p379
aVspace experiments like that.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo, as I said, there's
p382
aVlots of examples, and I'm going to stop here. And I just
p383
aVwant to thank the Arduino community
p384
aVfor being the best, and just
p385
aVevery day making lots of projects.
p386
aVThank you. (Applause)
p387
aa(lp388
V(Applause)
p389
aa(lp390
VAnd thanks to the community.
p391
aa(lp392
VChris Anderson: Massimo,
p393
aVyou told me earlier today that you had no idea, of course,
p394
aVthat it would take off like this.
p395
aa(lp396
VMB: No.
p397
aa(lp398
VCA: I mean, how must you feel when you read this stuff and you
p399
aVsee what you've unlocked?
p400
aa(lp401
VMB: Well, it's the work of a lot of people, so we as a community
p402
aVare enabling people to make
p403
aVgreat stuff, and I just feel overwhelmed.
p404
aVIt's just, it's difficult to describe this.
p405
aVEvery morning, I wake up and I look at all the stuff that
p406
aVGoogle Alerts sends me, and it's
p407
aVjust amazing. It's just
p408
aVgoing into every field that you can imagine.
p409
aa(lp410
VCA: Thank you so much. (Applause)

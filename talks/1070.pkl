VEver since I was a little girl
p5
aVseeing "Star Wars" for the first time,
p6
aVI've been fascinated by this idea
p7
aVof personal robots.
p8
aVAnd as a little girl,
p9
aVI loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us
p10
aVmuch more like a helpful, trusted sidekick \u2014
p11
aVsomething that would delight us, enrich our lives
p12
aVand help us save a galaxy or two.
p13
aVI knew robots like that didn't really exist,
p14
aVbut I knew I wanted to build them.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo 20 years pass \u2014
p17
aVI am now a graduate student at MIT
p18
aVstudying artificial intelligence,
p19
aVthe year is 1997,
p20
aVand NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars.
p21
aVBut robots are still not in our home, ironically.
p22
aVAnd I remember thinking about
p23
aVall the reasons why that was the case.
p24
aVBut one really struck me.
p25
aVRobotics had really been about interacting with things,
p26
aVnot with people \u2014
p27
aVcertainly not in a social way that would be natural for us
p28
aVand would really help people accept robots
p29
aVinto our daily lives.
p30
aVFor me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet.
p31
aVAnd so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet,
p32
aVthe world's first social robot.
p33
aVThree years later \u2014
p34
aVa lot of programming,
p35
aVworking with other graduate students in the lab \u2014
p36
aVKismet was ready to start interacting with people.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Video) Scientist: I want to show you something.
p39
aa(lp40
VKismet: (Nonsense)
p41
aa(lp42
VScientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me.
p43
aa(lp44
VKismet: (Nonsense)
p45
aa(lp46
VScientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too.
p47
aVI almost lost it this week.
p48
aa(lp49
VCynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with people
p50
aVlike kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child,
p51
aVwhich I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind.
p52
aVIt didn't speak language, but it didn't matter.
p53
aVThis little robot was somehow able
p54
aVto tap into something deeply social within us \u2014
p55
aVand with that, the promise of an entirely new way
p56
aVwe could interact with robots.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo over the past several years
p59
aVI've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots,
p60
aVnow at the media lab
p61
aVwith my own team of incredibly talented students.
p62
aVAnd one of my favorite robots is Leonardo.
p63
aVWe developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio.
p64
aVAnd so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo.
p65
aVThis is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo,
p66
aVintroducing Leo to a new object.
p67
aVAnd because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it.
p68
aVBut sort of like us, he can actually learn about it
p69
aVfrom watching Matt's reaction.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Video) Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo.
p72
aVLeo, this is Cookie Monster.
p73
aVCan you find Cookie Monster?
p74
aVLeo, Cookie Monster is very bad.
p75
aVHe's very bad, Leo.
p76
aVCookie Monster is very, very bad.
p77
aVHe's a scary monster.
p78
aVHe wants to get your cookies.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VCB: All right, so Leo and Cookie
p83
aVmight have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start,
p84
aVbut they get along great now.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo what I've learned
p87
aVthrough building these systems
p88
aVis that robots are actually
p89
aVa really intriguing social technology,
p90
aVwhere it's actually their ability
p91
aVto push our social buttons
p92
aVand to interact with us like a partner
p93
aVthat is a core part of their functionality.
p94
aVAnd with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imagine
p95
aVnew questions, new possibilities for robots
p96
aVthat we might not have thought about otherwise.
p97
aVBut what do I mean when I say "push our social buttons?"
p98
aVWell, one of the things that we've learned
p99
aVis that, if we design these robots to communicate with us
p100
aVusing the same body language,
p101
aVthe same sort of non-verbal cues that people use \u2014
p102
aVlike Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here \u2014
p103
aVwhat we find is that people respond to robots
p104
aVa lot like they respond to people.
p105
aVPeople use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is,
p106
aVhow likable, how engaging,
p107
aVhow trustworthy.
p108
aVIt turns out it's the same for robots.
p109
aa(lp110
VIt's turning out now
p111
aVthat robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool
p112
aVto understand human behavior.
p113
aVTo answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter,
p114
aVwe're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is?
p115
aVMimicry's believed to play a role, but how?
p116
aVIs it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters?
p117
aVIt turns out it's really hard
p118
aVto learn this or understand this from watching people
p119
aVbecause when we interact we do all of these cues automatically.
p120
aVWe can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us.
p121
aVBut with the robot, you can.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd so in this video here \u2014
p124
aVthis is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University.
p125
aVHe's a psychologist we've been collaborating with.
p126
aVThere's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues
p127
aVto be able to study this question.
p128
aVAnd the bottom line is \u2014 the reason why this works is
p129
aVbecause it turns out people just behave like people
p130
aVeven when interacting with a robot.
p131
aVSo given that key insight,
p132
aVwe can now start to imagine
p133
aVnew kinds of applications for robots.
p134
aVFor instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues,
p135
aVmaybe they would be a cool, new communication technology.
p136
aVSo imagine this:
p137
aVWhat about a robot accessory for your cellphone?
p138
aVYou call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot,
p139
aVand, bam! You're a MeBot \u2014
p140
aVyou can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends,
p141
aVyou can move around, you can gesture \u2014
p142
aVmaybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?
p143
aa(lp144
VTo explore this question,
p145
aVmy student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study
p146
aVwhere we brought human participants, people, into our lab
p147
aVto do a collaborative task
p148
aVwith a remote collaborator.
p149
aVThe task involved things
p150
aVlike looking at a set of objects on the table,
p151
aVdiscussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task \u2014
p152
aVthis ended up being a survival task \u2014
p153
aVand then rating them in terms
p154
aVof how valuable and important they thought they were.
p155
aVThe remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group
p156
aVwho used one of three different technologies
p157
aVto interact with the participants.
p158
aVThe first was just the screen.
p159
aVThis is just like video conferencing today.
p160
aVThe next was to add mobility \u2014 so, have the screen on a mobile base.
p161
aVThis is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today \u2014
p162
aVthis is mirroring that situation.
p163
aVAnd then the fully expressive MeBot.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo after the interaction,
p166
aVwe asked people to rate their quality of interaction
p167
aVwith the technology, with a remote collaborator
p168
aVthrough this technology, in a number of different ways.
p169
aVWe looked at psychological involvement \u2014
p170
aVhow much empathy did you feel for the other person?
p171
aVWe looked at overall engagement.
p172
aVWe looked at their desire to cooperate.
p173
aVAnd this is what we see when they use just the screen.
p174
aVIt turns out, when you add mobility \u2014 the ability to roll around the table \u2014
p175
aVyou get a little more of a boost.
p176
aVAnd you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression.
p177
aVSo it seems like this physical, social embodiment
p178
aVactually really makes a difference.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow let's try to put this into a little bit of context.
p181
aVToday we know that families are living further and further apart,
p182
aVand that definitely takes a toll on family relationships
p183
aVand family bonds over distance.
p184
aVFor me, I have three young boys,
p185
aVand I want them to have a really good relationship
p186
aVwith their grandparents.
p187
aVBut my parents live thousands of miles away,
p188
aVso they just don't get to see each other that often.
p189
aVWe try Skype, we try phone calls,
p190
aVbut my boys are little \u2014 they don't really want to talk;
p191
aVthey want to play.
p192
aVSo I love the idea of thinking about robots
p193
aVas a new kind of distance-play technology.
p194
aVI imagine a time not too far from now \u2014
p195
aVmy mom can go to her computer,
p196
aVopen up a browser and jack into a little robot.
p197
aVAnd as grandma-bot,
p198
aVshe can now play, really play,
p199
aVwith my sons, with her grandsons,
p200
aVin the real world with his real toys.
p201
aVI could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays
p202
aVwith their granddaughters, with their friends,
p203
aVand to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house,
p204
aVlike sharing a bedtime story.
p205
aVAnd through this technology,
p206
aVbeing able to be an active participant
p207
aVin their grandchildren's lives
p208
aVin a way that's not possible today.
p209
aa(lp210
VLet's think about some other domains,
p211
aVlike maybe health.
p212
aVSo in the United States today,
p213
aVover 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese,
p214
aVand now it's a big problem with our children as well.
p215
aVAnd we know that as you get older in life,
p216
aVif you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases
p217
aVthat not only reduce your quality of life,
p218
aVbut are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system.
p219
aVBut if robots can be engaging,
p220
aVif we like to cooperate with robots,
p221
aVif robots are persuasive,
p222
aVmaybe a robot can help you
p223
aVmaintain a diet and exercise program,
p224
aVmaybe they can help you manage your weight.
p225
aVSort of like a digital Jiminy \u2014
p226
aVas in the well-known fairy tale \u2014
p227
aVa kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there
p228
aVto be able to help you make the right decision
p229
aVin the right way at the right time
p230
aVto help you form healthy habits.
p231
aVSo we actually explored this idea in our lab.
p232
aa(lp233
VThis is a robot, Autom.
p234
aVCory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.
p235
aVAnd it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.
p236
aVIt had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.
p237
aVIt could make eye contact with you.
p238
aVIt could share information looking down at a screen.
p239
aVYou'd use a screen interface to enter information,
p240
aVlike how many calories you ate that day,
p241
aVhow much exercise you got.
p242
aVAnd then it could help track that for you.
p243
aVAnd the robot spoke with a synthetic voice
p244
aVto engage you in a coaching dialogue
p245
aVmodeled after trainers
p246
aVand patients and so forth.
p247
aVAnd it would build a working alliance with you
p248
aVthrough that dialogue.
p249
aVIt could help you set goals and track your progress,
p250
aVand it would help motivate you.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo an interesting question is,
p253
aVdoes the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot?
p254
aVIs it really just the quality of advice and information that matters?
p255
aVTo explore that question,
p256
aVwe did a study in the Boston area
p257
aVwhere we put one of three interventions in people's homes
p258
aVfor a period of several weeks.
p259
aVOne case was the robot you saw there, Autom.
p260
aVAnother was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface,
p261
aVran exactly the same dialogues.
p262
aVThe quality of advice was identical.
p263
aVAnd the third was just a pen and paper log,
p264
aVbecause that's the standard intervention you typically get
p265
aVwhen you start a diet-and-exercise program.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo one of the things we really wanted to look at
p268
aVwas not how much weight people lost,
p269
aVbut really how long they interacted with the robot.
p270
aVBecause the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off.
p271
aVAnd the longer you could interact with one of these interventions,
p272
aVwell that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success.
p273
aVSo the first thing I want to look at is how long,
p274
aVhow long did people interact with these systems.
p275
aVIt turns out that people interacted with the robot
p276
aVsignificantly more,
p277
aVeven though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer.
p278
aVWhen it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance,
p279
aVpeople rated the robot higher
p280
aVand they trusted the robot more.
p281
aV(Laughter)
p282
aVAnd when you look at emotional engagement,
p283
aVit was completely different.
p284
aVPeople would name the robots.
p285
aVThey would dress the robots.
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVAnd even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study,
p288
aVthey would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.
p289
aVThey didn't do this with a computer.
p290
aa(lp291
VThe last thing I want to talk about today
p292
aVis the future of children's media.
p293
aVWe know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today,
p294
aVwhether it's television or computer games or whatnot.
p295
aVMy sons, they love the screen. They love the screen.
p296
aVBut I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play,
p297
aVlike, real-world play.
p298
aVAnd so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today
p299
aVcalled Playtime Computing
p300
aVthat's really trying to think about how we can take
p301
aVwhat's so engaging about digital media
p302
aVand literally bring it off the screen
p303
aVinto the real world of the child,
p304
aVwhere it can take on many of the properties of real-world play.
p305
aVSo here's the first exploration of this idea,
p306
aVwhere characters can be physical or virtual,
p307
aVand where the digital content
p308
aVcan literally come off the screen
p309
aVinto the world and back.
p310
aVI like to think of this
p311
aVas the Atari Pong
p312
aVof this blended-reality play.
p313
aa(lp314
VBut we can push this idea further.
p315
aVWhat if \u2014
p316
aV(Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!
p317
aVCB: \u2014 the character itself could come into your world?
p318
aVIt turns out that kids love it
p319
aVwhen the character becomes real and enters into their world.
p320
aVAnd when it's in their world,
p321
aVthey can relate to it and play with it in a way
p322
aVthat's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.
p323
aVAnother important idea is this notion
p324
aVof persistence of character across realities.
p325
aVSo changes that children make in the real world
p326
aVneed to translate to the virtual world.
p327
aVSo here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.
p328
aVYou can imagine maybe these symbols
p329
aVgive the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.
p330
aVSo they are now sending the character back into that world.
p331
aVAnd now it's got number power.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd then finally, what I've been trying to do here
p334
aVis create a really immersive experience for kids,
p335
aVwhere they really feel like they are part of that story,
p336
aVa part of that experience.
p337
aVAnd I really want to spark their imaginations
p338
aVthe way mine was sparked as a little girl watching "Star Wars."
p339
aVBut I want to do more than that.
p340
aVI actually want them to create those experiences.
p341
aVI want them to be able to literally build their imagination
p342
aVinto these experiences and make them their own.
p343
aVSo we've been exploring a lot of ideas
p344
aVin telepresence and mixed reality
p345
aVto literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space
p346
aVwhere other kids can interact with them
p347
aVand build upon them.
p348
aVI really want to come up with new ways of children's media
p349
aVthat foster creativity and learning and innovation.
p350
aVI think that's very, very important.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo this is a new project.
p353
aVWe've invited a lot of kids into this space,
p354
aVand they think it's pretty cool.
p355
aVBut I can tell you, the thing that they love the most
p356
aVis the robot.
p357
aVWhat they care about is the robot.
p358
aVRobots touch something deeply human within us.
p359
aVAnd so whether they're helping us
p360
aVto become creative and innovative,
p361
aVor whether they're helping us
p362
aVto feel more deeply connected despite distance,
p363
aVor whether they are our trusted sidekick
p364
aVwho's helping us attain our personal goals
p365
aVin becoming our highest and best selves,
p366
aVfor me, robots are all about people.
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you.

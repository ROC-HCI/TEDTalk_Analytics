VJohn Hockenberry: It's great to be here with you, Tom.
p5
aVAnd I want to start with a question
p6
aVthat has just been consuming me
p7
aVsince I first became familiar with your work.
p8
aVIn you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality
p9
aVof a natural force
p10
aVin some sort of interplay with creative force.
p11
aVAre they ever in equilibrium
p12
aVin the way that you see your work?
p13
aa(lp14
VTom Shannon: Yeah, the subject matter that I'm looking for,
p15
aVit's usually to solve a question.
p16
aVI had the question popped into my head:
p17
aVWhat does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like
p18
aVif you could connect the two spheres?
p19
aVAnd in proportion, what would the size of the sphere
p20
aVand the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth?
p21
aVAnd so I went about and made that sculpture,
p22
aVturning it out of solid bronze.
p23
aVAnd I did one that was about 35 feet long.
p24
aVThe sun end was about four inches in diameter,
p25
aVand then it tapered over about 35 feet
p26
aVto about a millimeter at the Earth end.
p27
aVAnd so for me, it was really exciting
p28
aVjust to see what it looks like
p29
aVif you could step outside and into a larger context,
p30
aVas though you were an astronaut,
p31
aVand see these two things as an object,
p32
aVbecause they are so intimately bound,
p33
aVand one is meaningless without the other.
p34
aa(lp35
VJH: Is there a relief
p36
aVin playing with these forces?
p37
aVAnd I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is
p38
aVin playing with these forces.
p39
aa(lp40
VTS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects \u2014
p41
aVlike that silver one there,
p42
aVthat was the result
p43
aVof hundreds of experiments with magnets,
p44
aVtrying to find a way to make something float
p45
aVwith the least possible connection to the ground.
p46
aVSo I got it down to just one tether
p47
aVto be able to support that.
p48
aa(lp49
VJH: Now is this electromagnetic here, or are these static?
p50
aa(lp51
VTS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah.
p52
aa(lp53
VJH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise.
p54
aa(lp55
VTS: Yeah.
p56
aVIt's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.
p57
aa(lp58
VJH: I agree.
p59
aa(lp60
VTS: The magnetic works
p61
aVare a combination of gravity and magnetism,
p62
aVso it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces
p63
aVthat influence everything.
p64
aVThe sun has a tremendous field
p65
aVthat extends way beyond the planets
p66
aVand the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun.
p67
aVSo there's this huge
p68
aVinvisible shape structures
p69
aVthat magnetism takes in the universe.
p70
aVBut with the pendulum,
p71
aVit allows me to manifest
p72
aVthese invisible forces
p73
aVthat are holding the magnets up.
p74
aVMy sculptures
p75
aVare normally very simplified.
p76
aVI try to refine them down
p77
aVto very simple forms.
p78
aVBut the paintings become very complex,
p79
aVbecause I think the fields
p80
aVthat are supporting them,
p81
aVthey're billowing, and they're interpenetrating,
p82
aVand they're interference patterns.
p83
aa(lp84
VJH: And they're non-deterministic.
p85
aVI mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin,
p86
aVeven though the forces can be calculated.
p87
aVSo the evolution of this \u2014
p88
aVI gather this isn't your first pendulum.
p89
aa(lp90
VTS: No. (JH: No.)
p91
aa(lp92
VTS: The first one I did was in the late 70's,
p93
aVand I just had a simple cone
p94
aVwith a spigot at the bottom of it.
p95
aVI threw it into an orbit,
p96
aVand it only had one color,
p97
aVand when it got to the center, the paint kept running out,
p98
aVso I had to run in there,
p99
aVdidn't have any control over the spigot remotely.
p100
aVSo that told me right away: I need a remote control device.
p101
aVBut then I started dreaming of having six colors.
p102
aVI sort of think about it as the DNA \u2014
p103
aVthese colors, the red, blue, yellow,
p104
aVthe primary colors and white and black.
p105
aVAnd if you put them together in different combinations \u2014
p106
aVjust like printing in a sense,
p107
aVlike how a magazine color is printed \u2014
p108
aVand put them under certain forces,
p109
aVwhich is orbiting them
p110
aVor passing them back and forth
p111
aVor drawing with them,
p112
aVthese amazing things started appearing.
p113
aa(lp114
VJH: It looks like we're loaded for bear here.
p115
aa(lp116
VTS: Yeah, well let's put a couple of canvases.
p117
aVI'll ask a couple of my sons
p118
aVto set up the canvases here.
p119
aVI want to just say \u2014
p120
aVso this is Jack, Nick and Louie.
p121
aa(lp122
VJH: Thanks guys.
p123
aa(lp124
VTS: So here are the \u2014
p125
aa(lp126
VJH: All right, I'll get out of the way here.
p127
aa(lp128
VTS: I'm just going to throw this into an orbit
p129
aVand see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VJH: Whoa. That is ...
p134
aVooh, nice.
p135
aa(lp136
VTS: So something like this.
p137
aVI'm doing this as a demo,
p138
aVand it's more playful,
p139
aVbut inevitably,
p140
aVall of this can be used.
p141
aVI can redeem this painting,
p142
aVjust continuing on,
p143
aVdoing layers upon layers.
p144
aVAnd I keep it around for a couple of weeks,
p145
aVand I'm contemplating it,
p146
aVand I'll do another session with it
p147
aVand bring it up to another level,
p148
aVwhere all of this
p149
aVbecomes the background, the depth of it.
p150
aa(lp151
VJH: That's fantastic.
p152
aVSo the valves at the bottom of those tubes there
p153
aVare like radio-controlled airplane valves.
p154
aa(lp155
VTS: Yes, they're servos with cams
p156
aVthat pinch these rubber tubes.
p157
aVAnd they can pinch them very tight and stop it,
p158
aVor you can have them wide open.
p159
aVAnd all of the colors
p160
aVcome out one central port
p161
aVat the bottom.
p162
aVYou can always be changing colors, put aluminum paint,
p163
aVor I could put anything into this.
p164
aVIt could be tomato sauce,
p165
aVor anything could be dispensed \u2014
p166
aVsand, powders or anything like that.
p167
aa(lp168
VJH: So many forces there.
p169
aVYou've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force,
p170
aVyou've got the fluid dynamics.
p171
aVEach of these beautiful paintings,
p172
aVare they images in and of themselves,
p173
aVor are they records
p174
aVof a physical event
p175
aVcalled the pendulum approaching the canvas?
p176
aa(lp177
VTS: Well, this painting here,
p178
aVI wanted to do something very simple,
p179
aVa simple, iconic image
p180
aVof two ripples interfering.
p181
aVSo the one on the right was done first,
p182
aVand then the one on the left
p183
aVwas done over it.
p184
aVAnd then I left gaps
p185
aVso you could see the one that was done before.
p186
aVAnd then when I did the second one,
p187
aVit really disturbed the piece \u2014
p188
aVthese big blue lines
p189
aVcrashing through the center of it \u2014
p190
aVand so it created a kind of tension and an overlap.
p191
aVThere are lines in front of the one on the right,
p192
aVand there are lines behind the one on the left,
p193
aVand so it takes it into different planes.
p194
aVWhat it's also about,
p195
aVjust the little events,
p196
aVthe events of the interpenetration of \u2014
p197
aa(lp198
VJH: Two stars, or \u2014
p199
aa(lp200
VTS: Two things that happened \u2014
p201
aVthere's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens.
p202
aVThere are shapes that come about
p203
aVjust by the marriage
p204
aVof two events that are happening,
p205
aVand I'm very interested in that.
p206
aVLike the occurrence of moire patterns.
p207
aVLike this green one,
p208
aVthis is a painting I did about 10 years ago,
p209
aVbut it has some \u2014
p210
aVsee, in the upper third \u2014
p211
aVthere are these moires and interference patterns
p212
aVthat are radio kind of imagery.
p213
aVAnd that's something that in painting
p214
aVI've never seen done.
p215
aVI've never seen a representation
p216
aVof a kind of radio interference patterns,
p217
aVwhich are so ubiquitous
p218
aVand such an important part of our lives.
p219
aa(lp220
VJH: Is that a literal part of the image,
p221
aVor is my eye making that interference pattern \u2014
p222
aVis my eye completing that interference pattern?
p223
aa(lp224
VTS: It is the paint actually,
p225
aVmakes it real.
p226
aVIt's really manifested there.
p227
aVIf I throw a very concentric circle,
p228
aVor concentric ellipse,
p229
aVit just dutifully makes
p230
aVthese evenly spaced lines,
p231
aVwhich get closer and closer together,
p232
aVwhich describes how gravity works.
p233
aVThere's something very appealing
p234
aVabout the exactitude of science
p235
aVthat I really enjoy.
p236
aVAnd I love the shapes that I see
p237
aVin scientific observations
p238
aVand apparatus,
p239
aVespecially astronomical forms
p240
aVand the idea of the vastness of it,
p241
aVthe scale,
p242
aVis very interesting to me.
p243
aa(lp244
VMy focus in recent years
p245
aVhas kind of shifted more toward biology.
p246
aVSome of these paintings, when you look at them very close,
p247
aVodd things appear
p248
aVthat really look like horses or birds
p249
aVor crocodiles, elephants.
p250
aVThere are lots of things that appear.
p251
aVWhen you look into it, it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns,
p252
aVbut sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.
p253
aVAnd then there are all these forms
p254
aVthat we don't know what they are,
p255
aVbut they're equally well-resolved
p256
aVand complex.
p257
aVSo I think, conceivably, those could be predictive.
p258
aVBecause since it has the ability
p259
aVto make forms
p260
aVthat look like forms that we're familiar with
p261
aVin biology,
p262
aVit's also making other forms that we're not familiar with.
p263
aVAnd maybe it's the kind of forms
p264
aVwe'll discover underneath the surface of Mars,
p265
aVwhere there are probably lakes
p266
aVwith fish swimming under the surface.
p267
aa(lp268
VJH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's.
p269
aVOh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.
p270
aVYou know, it seems
p271
aVat this stage in your life,
p272
aVyou also very personally
p273
aVare in this state of confrontation
p274
aVwith a sort of dissonant \u2014
p275
aVI suppose it's an electromagnetic force
p276
aVthat somehow governs your Parkinson's
p277
aVand this creative force
p278
aVthat is both the artist
p279
aVwho is in the here and now
p280
aVand this sort of arc of your whole life.
p281
aVIs that relevant to your work?
p282
aa(lp283
VTS: As it turns out,
p284
aVthis device kind of comes in handy,
p285
aVbecause I don't have to have
p286
aVthe fine motor skills to do,
p287
aVthat I can operate slides,
p288
aVwhich is more of a mental process.
p289
aVI'm looking at it and making decisions:
p290
aVIt needs more red, it needs more blue,
p291
aVit needs a different shape.
p292
aVAnd so I make these creative decisions
p293
aVand can execute them
p294
aVin a much, much simpler way.
p295
aVI mean, I've got the symptoms.
p296
aVI guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years,
p297
aVbut at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.
p298
aVIn my case,
p299
aVmy left hand has a significant tremor
p300
aVand my left leg also.
p301
aVI'm left-handed, and so I draw.
p302
aVAll my creations
p303
aVreally start on small drawings,
p304
aVwhich I have thousands of,
p305
aVand it's my way of just thinking.
p306
aVI draw with a simple pencil,
p307
aVand at first, the Parkinson's
p308
aVwas really upsetting,
p309
aVbecause I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.
p310
aa(lp311
VJH: So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces.
p312
aVYou don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.
p313
aVYou think of yourself as the servant.
p314
aa(lp315
VTS: Nature is \u2014 well, it's a godsend.
p316
aVIt just has so much in it.
p317
aVAnd I think nature
p318
aVwants to express itself
p319
aVin the sense that we are nature,
p320
aVhumans are of the universe.
p321
aVThe universe is in our mind,
p322
aVand our minds are in the universe.
p323
aVAnd we are expressions
p324
aVof the universe, basically.
p325
aVAs humans,
p326
aVultimately being part of the universe,
p327
aVwe're kind of the spokespeople
p328
aVor the observer part
p329
aVof the constituency
p330
aVof the universe.
p331
aVAnd to interface with it,
p332
aVwith a device that lets these forces
p333
aVthat are everywhere
p334
aVact and show what they can do,
p335
aVgiving them pigment and paint just like an artist,
p336
aVit's a good ally.
p337
aVIt's a terrific studio assistant.
p338
aa(lp339
VJH: Well, I love the idea
p340
aVthat somewhere within this idea
p341
aVof fine motion and control
p342
aVwith the traditional skills
p343
aVthat you have with your hand,
p344
aVsome sort of more elemental force gets revealed,
p345
aVand that's the beauty here.
p346
aVTom, thank you so much. It's been really, really great.
p347
aa(lp348
VTS: Thank you, John.

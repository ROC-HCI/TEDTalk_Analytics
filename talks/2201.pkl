VWe humans have always been very concerned about the health of our bodies,
p5
aVbut we haven't always been that good at figuring out what's important.
p6
aVTake the ancient Egyptians, for example:
p7
aVvery concerned about the body parts they thought they'd need in the afterlife,
p8
aVbut they left some parts out.
p9
aVThis part, for example.
p10
aVAlthough they very carefully  preserved the stomach, the lungs,
p11
aVthe liver, and so forth,
p12
aVthey just mushed up the brain, drained it out through the nose,
p13
aVand threw it away,
p14
aVwhich makes sense, really,
p15
aVbecause what does a brain do for us anyway?
p16
aVBut imagine if there were a kind of neglected organ in our bodies
p17
aVthat weighed just as much as the brain
p18
aVand in some ways was just as important to who we are,
p19
aVbut we knew so little about and treated with such disregard.
p20
aVAnd imagine if, through new scientific advances,
p21
aVwe were just beginning to understand
p22
aVits importance to how we think of ourselves.
p23
aVWouldn't you want to know more about it?
p24
aa(lp25
VWell, it turns out that we do have something just like that:
p26
aVour gut,
p27
aVor rather, its microbes.
p28
aVBut it's not just the microbes in our gut that are important.
p29
aVMicrobes all over our body
p30
aVturn out to be really critical to a whole range of differences
p31
aVthat make different people who we are.
p32
aVSo for example, have you ever noticed
p33
aVhow some people get bitten by mosquitos way more often than others?
p34
aa(lp35
VIt turns out that everyone's anecdotal experience out camping is actually true.
p36
aVFor example, I seldom get bitten by mosquitos,
p37
aVbut my partner Amanda attracts them in droves,
p38
aVand the reason why is that we have different microbes on our skin
p39
aVthat produce different chemicals that the mosquitos detect.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, microbes are also really important in the field of medicine.
p42
aVSo, for example, what microbes you have in your gut
p43
aVdetermine whether particular painkillers are toxic to your liver.
p44
aVThey also determine whether or not other drugs will work for your heart condition.
p45
aVAnd, if you're a fruit fly, at least,
p46
aVyour microbes determine who you want to have sex with.
p47
aVWe haven't demonstrated this in humans yet
p48
aVbut maybe it's just a matter of time before we find out. (Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VSo microbes are performing a huge range of functions.
p51
aVThey help us digest our food.
p52
aVThey help educate our immune system.
p53
aVThey help us resist disease,
p54
aVand they may even be affecting our behavior.
p55
aVSo what would a map of all these microbial communities look like?
p56
aVWell, it wouldn't look exactly like this,
p57
aVbut it's a helpful guide for understanding biodiversity.
p58
aVDifferent parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms
p59
aVthat are immediately characteristic of one place or another
p60
aVor another.
p61
aVWith microbiology, it's kind of the same, although I've got to be honest with you:
p62
aVAll the microbes essentially look the same under a microscope.
p63
aVSo instead of trying to identify them visually,
p64
aVwhat we do is we look at their DNA sequences,
p65
aVand in a project called the Human Microbiome Project,
p66
aVNIH funded this $173 million project
p67
aVwhere hundreds  of researchers came together
p68
aVto map out all the A's, T's, G's, and C's,
p69
aVand all of these microbes in the human body.
p70
aVSo when we take them together, they look like this.
p71
aVIt's a bit more difficult to tell who lives where now, isn't it?
p72
aa(lp73
VWhat my lab does is develop computational techniques that allow us
p74
aVto take all these terabytes of sequence data
p75
aVand turn them into something that's a bit more useful as a map,
p76
aVand so when we do that with the human microbiome data
p77
aVfrom 250 healthy volunteers,
p78
aVit looks like this.
p79
aVEach point here represents all the complex microbes
p80
aVin an entire microbial community.
p81
aVSee, I told you they basically all look the same.
p82
aVSo what we're looking at is each point represents one microbial community
p83
aVfrom one body site of one healthy volunteer.
p84
aVAnd so you can see that there's different parts of the map in different colors,
p85
aValmost like separate continents.
p86
aVAnd what it turns out to be
p87
aVis that those, as the different regions of the body,
p88
aVhave very different microbes in them.
p89
aVSo what we have is we have the oral community up there in green.
p90
aVOver on the other side, we have the skin community in blue,
p91
aVthe vaginal community in purple,
p92
aVand then right down at the bottom, we have the fecal community in brown.
p93
aVAnd we've just over the last few years
p94
aVfound out that the microbes in different parts of the body
p95
aVare amazingly different from one another.
p96
aVSo if I look at just one person's microbes
p97
aVin the mouth and in the gut,
p98
aVit turns out that the difference between those two microbial communities
p99
aVis enormous.
p100
aVIt's bigger than the difference between the microbes in this reef
p101
aVand the microbes in this prairie.
p102
aVSo this is incredible when you think about it.
p103
aVWhat it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body
p104
aVmakes more of a difference to your microbial ecology
p105
aVthan hundreds of miles on Earth.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd this is not to say that two people  look basically the same
p108
aVin the same body habitat, either.
p109
aVSo you probably heard
p110
aVthat we're pretty much all the same in terms of our human DNA.
p111
aVYou're 99.99 percent identical in terms of your human DNA
p112
aVto the person sitting next to you.
p113
aVBut that's not true of your gut microbes:
p114
aVyou might only share 10 percent similarity
p115
aVwith the person sitting next to you in terms of your gut microbes.
p116
aVSo that's as different as the bacteria on this prairie
p117
aVand the bacteria in this forest.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo these different microbes
p120
aVhave all these different kinds  of functions that I told you about,
p121
aVeverything from digesting food
p122
aVto involvement in different kinds of diseases,
p123
aVmetabolizing drugs, and so forth.
p124
aVSo how do they do all this stuff?
p125
aVWell, in part it's because
p126
aValthough there's just three pounds of those microbes in our gut,
p127
aVthey really outnumber us.
p128
aVAnd so how much do they outnumber us?
p129
aVWell, it depends on what you think of as our bodies.
p130
aVIs it our cells?
p131
aVWell, each of us consists of about 10 trillion human cells,
p132
aVbut we harbor as many as 100 trillion microbial cells.
p133
aVSo they outnumber us 10 to one.
p134
aVNow, you might think, well, we're human because of our DNA,
p135
aVbut it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes,
p136
aVdepending on what you count exactly,
p137
aVbut as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes.
p138
aVSo whichever way we look at it, we're vastly outnumbered
p139
aVby our microbial symbionts.
p140
aVAnd it turns out that in addition  to traces of our human DNA,
p141
aVwe also leave traces of our microbial DNA
p142
aVon everything we touch.
p143
aVWe showed in a study a few years ago
p144
aVthat you can actually match the palm of someone's hand up
p145
aVto the computer mouse that they use routinely
p146
aVwith up to 95 percent accuracy.
p147
aVSo this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago,
p148
aVbut more importantly, it was featured on "CSI: Miami,"
p149
aVso you really know it's true.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VSo where do our microbes come from in the first place?
p153
aVWell if, as I do, you have dogs or kids,
p154
aVyou probably have some dark suspicions about that,
p155
aVall of which are true, by the way.
p156
aVSo just like we can match you to your computer equipment
p157
aVby the microbes you share,
p158
aVwe can also match you up to your dog.
p159
aVBut it turns out that in adults,
p160
aVmicrobial communities are relatively stable,
p161
aVso even if you live together with someone,
p162
aVyou'll maintain your separate microbial identity
p163
aVover a period of weeks, months, even years.
p164
aa(lp165
VIt turns out that our first microbial communities
p166
aVdepend a lot on how we're born.
p167
aVSo babies that come out the regular way,
p168
aVall of their microbes are basically like the vaginal community,
p169
aVwhereas babies that are delivered by C-section,
p170
aVall of their microbes instead look like skin.
p171
aVAnd this might be associated with some of the differences
p172
aVin health associated with Cesarean birth,
p173
aVsuch as more asthma, more allergies, even more obesity,
p174
aVall of which have been linked to microbes now,
p175
aVand when you think about it, until recently, every surviving mammal
p176
aVhad been delivered by the birth canal,
p177
aVand so the lack of those protective microbes
p178
aVthat we've co-evolved with might be really important
p179
aVfor a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome.
p180
aa(lp181
VWhen my own daughter was born a couple of years ago
p182
aVby emergency C-section,
p183
aVwe took matters into our own hands
p184
aVand made sure she was coated with those vaginal microbes
p185
aVthat she would have gotten naturally.
p186
aVNow, it's really difficult to tell whether this has had an effect
p187
aVon her health specifically, right?
p188
aVWith a sample size of just one child, no matter how much we love her,
p189
aVyou don't really have enough of a sample size
p190
aVto figure out what happens on average,
p191
aVbut at two years old, she hasn't had an ear infection yet,
p192
aVso we're keeping our fingers crossed on that one.
p193
aVAnd what's more, we're starting to do clinical trials with more children
p194
aVto figure out whether this has a protective effect generally.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo how we're born has a tremendous effect on what microbes we have initially,
p197
aVbut where do we go after that?
p198
aVWhat I'm showing you again here is this map
p199
aVof the Human Microbiome Project Data,
p200
aVso each point represents a sample from one body site
p201
aVfrom one of 250 healthy adults.
p202
aVAnd you've seen children develop physically.
p203
aVYou've seen them develop mentally.
p204
aVNow, for the first time, you're going to see
p205
aVone of my colleague's children develop microbially.
p206
aVSo what we are going to look at
p207
aVis we're going to look  at this one baby's stool,
p208
aVthe fecal community, which represents the gut,
p209
aVsampled every week for almost two and a half years.
p210
aVAnd so we're starting on day one.
p211
aVWhat's going to happen is that the infant is going to start off as this yellow dot,
p212
aVand you can see that he's starting off basically in the vaginal community,
p213
aVas we would expect from his delivery mode.
p214
aVAnd what's going to happen over these two and a half years
p215
aVis that he's going to travel  all the way down
p216
aVto resemble the adult fecal community from healthy volunteers down at the bottom.
p217
aVSo I'm just going to start this going and we'll see how that happens.
p218
aa(lp219
VWhat you can see, and remember each step in this is just one week,
p220
aVwhat you can see is that week to week,
p221
aVthe change in the microbial community of the feces of this one child,
p222
aVthe differences week to week are much greater
p223
aVthan the differences between individual healthy adults
p224
aVin the Human Microbiome Project cohort,
p225
aVwhich are those brown dots down at the bottom.
p226
aVAnd you can see he's starting to approach the adult fecal community.
p227
aVThis is up to about two years.
p228
aVBut something amazing is about to happen here.
p229
aVSo he's getting antibiotics for an ear infection.
p230
aVWhat you can see is this huge change in the community,
p231
aVfollowed by a relatively rapid recovery.
p232
aVI'll just rewind that for you.
p233
aVAnd what we can see is that just over these few weeks,
p234
aVwe have a much more radical change,
p235
aVa setback of many months  of normal development,
p236
aVfollowed by a relatively rapid recovery,
p237
aVand by the time he reaches day 838,
p238
aVwhich is the end of this video,
p239
aVyou can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community,
p240
aVdespite that antibiotic intervention.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo this is really interesting because it raises fundamental questions
p243
aVabout what happens when we intervene at different ages in a child's life.
p244
aVSo does what we do early on, where the microbiome is changing so rapidly,
p245
aVactually matter,
p246
aVor is it like throwing a stone into a stormy sea,
p247
aVwhere the ripples will just be lost?
p248
aVWell, fascinatingly, it turns out that if you give children antibiotics
p249
aVin the first six months of life,
p250
aVthey're more likely to become obese later on
p251
aVthan if they don't get antibiotics then or only get them later,
p252
aVand so what we do early on may have profound impacts
p253
aVon the gut microbial community and on later health
p254
aVthat we're only beginning to understand.
p255
aVSo this is fascinating, because one day, in addition to the effects
p256
aVthat antibiotics have on antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
p257
aVwhich are very important,
p258
aVthey may also be degrading our gut microbial ecosystems,
p259
aVand so one day we may come to regard antibiotics with the same horror
p260
aVthat we currently reserve for those metal tools
p261
aVthat the Egyptians used to use to mush up the brains
p262
aVbefore they drained them out for embalming.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo I mentioned that microbes have all these important functions,
p265
aVand they've also now, just over the past few years,
p266
aVbeen connected to a whole range of different diseases,
p267
aVincluding inflammatory bowel disease,
p268
aVheart disease, colon cancer,
p269
aVand even obesity.
p270
aVObesity has a really  large effect, as it turns out,
p271
aVand today, we can tell whether you're lean or obese
p272
aVwith 90 percent accuracy
p273
aVby looking at the microbes in your gut.
p274
aVNow, although that might sound impressive,
p275
aVin some ways it's a little bit problematic as a medical test,
p276
aVbecause you can probably tell which of these people is obese
p277
aVwithout knowing anything about their gut microbes,
p278
aVbut it turns out that even if we sequence their complete genomes
p279
aVand had all their human DNA,
p280
aVwe could only predict which one was obese with about 60 percent accuracy.
p281
aVSo that's amazing, right?
p282
aVWhat it means that the three pounds of microbes that you carry around with you
p283
aVmay be more important for some health conditions
p284
aVthan every single gene in your genome.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd then in mice, we can do a lot more.
p287
aVSo in mice, microbes have been linked to all kinds of additional conditions,
p288
aVincluding things like multiple sclerosis,
p289
aVdepression, autism, and again, obesity.
p290
aVBut how can we tell whether these microbial differences
p291
aVthat correlate with disease are cause or effect?
p292
aVWell, one thing we can do is we can raise some mice
p293
aVwithout any microbes of their own in a germ-free bubble.
p294
aVThen we can add in some microbes that we think are important,
p295
aVand see what happens.
p296
aVWhen we take the microbes from an obese mouse
p297
aVand transplant them into a genetically normal mouse
p298
aVthat's been raised in a bubble with no microbes of its own,
p299
aVit becomes fatter than if it got them  from a regular mouse.
p300
aVWhy this happens is absolutely amazing, though.
p301
aVSometimes what's going on is that the microbes
p302
aVare helping them digest food more efficiently from the same diet,
p303
aVso they're taking more energy from their food,
p304
aVbut other times, the microbes are actually affecting their behavior.
p305
aVWhat they're doing is they're eating more than the normal mouse,
p306
aVso they only get fat if we let them  eat as much as they want.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo this is really remarkable, right?
p309
aVThe implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior.
p310
aVSo you might be wondering whether we can  also do this sort of thing across species,
p311
aVand it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person
p312
aVand transplant them into mice you've raised germ-free,
p313
aVthose mice will also become fatter
p314
aVthan if they received the microbes from a lean person,
p315
aVbut we can design a microbial community that we inoculate them with
p316
aVthat prevents them from gaining this weight.
p317
aa(lp318
VWe can also do this for malnutrition.
p319
aVSo in a project funded by the Gates Foundation,
p320
aVwhat we're looking at is children in Malawi
p321
aVwho have kwashiorkor, a profound form of malnutrition,
p322
aVand mice that get the kwashiorkor community transplanted into them
p323
aVlose 30 percent of their body mass
p324
aVin just three weeks,
p325
aVbut we can restore their health by using  the same peanut butter-based supplement
p326
aVthat is used for  the children in the clinic,
p327
aVand the mice that receive the community
p328
aVfrom the healthy identical twins of the kwashiorkor children do fine.
p329
aVThis is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pilot therapies
p330
aVby trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice
p331
aVwith individual people's gut communities
p332
aVand perhaps tailor those therapies all the way down to the individual level.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo I think it's really important that everyone has a chance
p335
aVto participate in this discovery.
p336
aVSo, a couple of years ago,
p337
aVwe started this project called American Gut,
p338
aVwhich allows you to claim a place  for yourself on this microbial map.
p339
aVThis is now the largest crowd-funded science project that we know of \u2014
p340
aVover 8,000 people have signed up at this point.
p341
aVWhat happens is, they send in their samples,
p342
aVwe sequence the DNA of their microbes and then release the results back to them.
p343
aVWe also release them, de-identified, to scientists, to educators,
p344
aVto interested members of the general public, and so forth,
p345
aVso anyone can have access to the data.
p346
aVOn the other hand,
p347
aVwhen we do tours of our lab at the BioFrontiers Institute,
p348
aVand we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop,
p349
aVit turns out that not everyone wants to know.
p350
aV(Laughter)
p351
aVBut I'm guessing that many of you do,
p352
aVand so I brought some kits here if you're interested
p353
aVin trying this out for yourself.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo why might we want to do this?
p356
aVWell, it turns out that microbes are not just important
p357
aVfor finding out where we are in terms of our health,
p358
aVbut they can actually cure disease.
p359
aVThis is one of the newest things we've been able to visualize
p360
aVwith colleagues  at the University of Minnesota.
p361
aVSo here's that map of the human microbiome again.
p362
aVWhat we're looking at now \u2014
p363
aVI'm going to add in the community of some people with C. diff.
p364
aVSo, this is a terrible form of diarrhea
p365
aVwhere you have to go up to 20 times a day,
p366
aVand these people have failed antibiotic therapy for two years
p367
aVbefore they're eligible for this trial.
p368
aVSo what would happen if we transplanted some of the stool from a healthy donor,
p369
aVthat star down at the bottom,
p370
aVinto these patients.
p371
aVWould the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes
p372
aVand help to restore their health?
p373
aVSo let's watch exactly what happens there.
p374
aVFour of those patients are about to get a transplant
p375
aVfrom that healthy donor at the bottom,
p376
aVand what you can see is that immediately,
p377
aVyou have this radical change in the gut community.
p378
aVSo one day after you do that transplant,
p379
aVall those symptoms clear up,
p380
aVthe diarrhea vanishes,
p381
aVand they're essentially healthy again, coming to resemble the donor's community,
p382
aVand they stay there.
p383
aV(Applause)
p384
aa(lp385
VSo we're just at the beginning of this discovery.
p386
aVWe're just finding out that microbes have implications
p387
aVfor all these different kinds of diseases,
p388
aVranging from inflammatory  bowel disease to obesity,
p389
aVand perhaps even autism and depression.
p390
aVWhat we need to do, though,
p391
aVis we need to develop a kind of microbial GPS,
p392
aVwhere we don't just know where we are currently
p393
aVbut also where we want to go and what we need to do
p394
aVin order to get there,
p395
aVand we need to be able to make this simple enough
p396
aVthat even a child can use it. (Laughter)
p397
aa(lp398
VThank you.

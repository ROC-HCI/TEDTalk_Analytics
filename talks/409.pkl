VThe north coast of California has rainforests \u2014
p5
aVtemperate rainforests \u2014 where it can rain more than 100 inches a year.
p6
aVThis is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree.
p7
aVIts species name is Sequoia sempervirens.
p8
aVSequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth.
p9
aVThe range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall.
p10
aVThat's 38 stories tall.
p11
aVThese are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan.
p12
aVNobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are
p13
aVbecause nobody has ever drilled into any of them
p14
aVto count their annual growth rings, and, in any case,
p15
aVthe centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow.
p16
aVBut it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods
p17
aVare perhaps 2,500 years old \u2014 roughly the age of the Parthenon \u2014
p18
aValthough it's also suspected that there may be individual trees
p19
aVthat are older than that.
p20
aa(lp21
VYou can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here, in red.
p22
aVThe largest individuals of this species,
p23
aVthe dreadnoughts of their kind, live just on the north coast of California,
p24
aVwhere the rain is really intense.
p25
aVIn recent historic times, about 96 percent of the Coast Redwood forest
p26
aVwas cut down, especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging,
p27
aVclear-cutting that took place in the 1970s through the early 1990s.
p28
aVEven so, about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact,
p29
aVwild and now protected \u2014 entirely protected \u2014
p30
aVin a chain of small parks strung out like pearls
p31
aValong the north coast of California, including Redwood National Park.
p32
aVBut curiously, Redwood rainforests, the fragments that we have left,
p33
aVto this day remain under-explored.
p34
aVRedwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through,
p35
aVand even today, individual trees are being discovered
p36
aVthat have never been seen before, including, in the summer of 2006,
p37
aVHyperion, the world's tallest tree.
p38
aa(lp39
VI'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment.
p40
aVI'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism.
p41
aVAnd, Chris, if I could have you up here? I have a tape measure.
p42
aVIt's a kind loaner from TED.
p43
aVAnd Chris, if you could take the end of that tape measure?
p44
aVWe're going to show you what the diameter
p45
aVat breast height of a big Redwood is.
p46
aVUnfortunately, this tape isn't long enough \u2014 it's only a 25-foot tape.
p47
aVChris, could you extend your arm out that way? There we go. OK.
p48
aVAnd maybe about here, about 30 feet, is the diameter of a big Redwood.
p49
aVNow, let your imagination go upward into space.
p50
aVThink about this tree, rising upward into Redwood space, 325 feet,
p51
aV32 stories, an individual living organism articulating its forms
p52
aVupward into space over long periods of time.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time:
p55
aVnot human time, but what we might call Redwood time.
p56
aVRedwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.
p57
aVTo us, when we look at a Redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still,
p58
aVand yet Redwoods are constantly in motion,
p59
aVmoving upward into space, articulating themselves
p60
aVand filling Redwood space over Redwood time, over thousands of years.
p61
aVPlant this small seed, wait 2,000 years, and you get this:
p62
aVthe Lost Monarch.
p63
aVIt dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast,
p64
aVand was discovered in 1998.
p65
aVAnd yet, when you look at the base of a Redwood tree,
p66
aVyou're not seeing the organism.
p67
aVYou're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant,
p68
aVand most of the organism is overhead, unseen.
p69
aa(lp70
VI became very interested, and I wrote about a couple.
p71
aVSteve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers
p72
aVof the Redwood forest canopy. They're world-class athletes,
p73
aVand they also are world-class forest ecology scientists.
p74
aVSteve Sillett, when he was a 19-year-old college student
p75
aVat Reed College, had heard that the Redwood forest canopy
p76
aVis considered to be a so-called Redwood desert.
p77
aVThat is to say, at that time it was believed
p78
aVthat there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees.
p79
aVAnd with a friend of his, he took it upon himself to free-climb a Redwood
p80
aVwithout ropes or any equipment to see what was up there.
p81
aVHe climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood,
p82
aVand then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands,
p83
aVand ended up hanging, like catching a bar of a trapeze.
p84
aVAnd then, from there, he climbed directly up the bark
p85
aVuntil he got to the top of the tree.
p86
aa(lp87
VHis friend, a guy named Marwood Harris, was following behind.
p88
aVNeither one of them had noticed that there was
p89
aVa Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball
p90
aVhanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into.
p91
aVAnd when Marwood made the jump, he was covered with wasps
p92
aVstinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go.
p93
aVHe would have fallen to his death, being 75 feet above the ground.
p94
aVBut they made it to the top, and what they found
p95
aVwas not a Redwood desert, but a lost world \u2014
p96
aVa kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air, filled with unknown life.
p97
aVNow, I had been working on other topics:
p98
aVthe emergence of infectious diseases,
p99
aVwhich come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth,
p100
aVmake a trans-species jump, and get into humans.
p101
aa(lp102
VAfter three books on this, it got to be a bit much, in a way.
p103
aVMy wife and I adore our children.
p104
aVAnd I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them,
p105
aVusing the so-called arborist climbing technique,
p106
aVwith ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree.
p107
aVChildren are incredibly adept at climbing trees.
p108
aVThat's my son, Oliver.
p109
aVThey don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VIf ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, then children
p114
aVare somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest.
p115
aVHumans appear to be the only primates that I know of
p116
aVthat are afraid of heights.
p117
aVAll other primates, when they're scared,
p118
aVthey run up a tree, where they feel safe.
p119
aVWe camped overnight in the trees, in tree boats.
p120
aVThis is my daughter Laura, then 15, looking out of a tree boat.
p121
aVShe's, by the way, tied in with a rope so she can't fall.
p122
aVLooking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong
p123
aVcoming in three dimensions around us.
p124
aVWe had been visited in the night by flying squirrels,
p125
aVwho don't seem to recognize humans for what they are
p126
aVbecause they've never seen them in the canopy before.
p127
aVAnd we practiced advanced techniques like sky-walking,
p128
aVwhere you can move from tree to tree through space,
p129
aVrather like Spiderman.
p130
aVIt became a writing project.
p131
aa(lp132
VWhen Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood, he fires an arrow,
p133
aVwhich trails a fishing line, which gets over a branch in the tree,
p134
aVand then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line.
p135
aVYou ascend 30 stories.
p136
aVThere are two people climbing this tree, Gaya,
p137
aVwhich is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods. There they are.
p138
aVThey are only one-seventh of the way up that tree.
p139
aVYou do feel a sense of exposure.
p140
aVThere is a small person right down there on the ground.
p141
aVYou feel like you're climbing a wall of wood.
p142
aVBut then you enter the Redwood canopy,
p143
aVand it's like coming through a layer of clouds.
p144
aVAnd all of a sudden, you lose sight of the ground,
p145
aVand you also lose sight of the sky,
p146
aVand you're in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air
p147
aVfilled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil,
p148
aVwhich is populated with all kinds of small organisms.
p149
aa(lp150
VThere are epiphytes, plants that grow on trees.
p151
aVThese are huckleberry bushes.
p152
aVMany species of mosses, and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree.
p153
aVWhen you get near the top of the tree, you feel like you can't fall \u2014
p154
aVin fact, it's difficult to move.
p155
aVYou're worming your way through branches which are crowded
p156
aVwith living things that don't occur near the ground.
p157
aVIt's like scuba diving into a coral reef,
p158
aVexcept you're going upward instead of downward.
p159
aVAnd then the trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top.
p160
aVMaria's sitting on one of them.
p161
aVThese limbs could be five to six hundred years old.
p162
aVRedwoods grow very slowly in their tops.
p163
aVThey also have a feature: thickets of huckleberry bushes
p164
aVthat grow out of the tops of Redwood trees
p165
aVthat are technically known as huckleberry afros,
p166
aVand you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting.
p167
aa(lp168
VRedwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space
p169
aVbecause they have a propensity to do something called reiteration.
p170
aVA Redwood is a fractal. And as they put out limbs,
p171
aVthe limbs burst into small trees, copies of the Redwood.
p172
aVNow, here we see a reiteration in Chronos, one of the older Redwoods.
p173
aVThis reiteration is a huge flying buttress
p174
aVthat comes out the tree itself.
p175
aVThis buttress is less than halfway up the tree.
p176
aVAnd then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods.
p177
aVThis particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base
p178
aVand extends upward for 150 feet.
p179
aVIt's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River,
p180
aVand yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos.
p181
aa(lp182
VThis three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar,
p183
aVmade by Steve Sillett, Marie Antoine and their colleagues, gives you an idea.
p184
aVWhat you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development
p185
aVof the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal,
p186
aVof trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks.
p187
aVI asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale.
p188
aVThere's the person, right there. The person is waving to us.
p189
aVI've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert
p190
aVa synthetic chromosome into a human
p191
aVso that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to.
p192
aVAnd if we were able to reiterate, then the fingers of our hand
p193
aVwould be people who looked like us,
p194
aVand they would have people on their hands and so on.
p195
aVAnd if we had Redwood-like biology,
p196
aVwe would have six layers of people on our hands, as it were.
p197
aVAnd it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone
p198
aVand have all our reiterations wave at the same time.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VTo reiterate the point, let's go closer into Iluvatar.
p203
aVWe're looking at that yellow box.
p204
aVAnd this hallucinatory drawing shows you \u2014
p205
aVeverything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar.
p206
aVThese are millennial structures \u2014 portions of the tree
p207
aVthat are believed to be more than 1,000 years old.
p208
aVThere are four humans in this shot \u2014 one, two, three, four.
p209
aVAnd there's also something that I want to show you.
p210
aVThis is a flying buttress.
p211
aVRedwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space,
p212
aVand this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk,
p213
aVgoing back into the main trunk and fusing with it.
p214
aVFlying buttresses, just as in a cathedral, help strengthen the crown of the tree
p215
aVand help the tree exist longer through time.
p216
aVThe scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees.
p217
aVThey've wired them like patients in an ICU.
p218
aa(lp219
VThey're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air
p220
aVand down into their trunks,
p221
aVpossibly all the way into their root systems.
p222
aVThey also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.
p223
aVIf a portion of a Redwood is rotting,
p224
aVthe Redwood will send roots into its own form
p225
aVand draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart.
p226
aVIf we had Redwood-like biology, if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm
p227
aVthen we could just, you know,
p228
aVextract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off.
p229
aVCanopy soil can occur up to a meter deep,
p230
aVhundreds of feet above the ground, and there are organisms in this soil
p231
aVthat have, as yet, no names.
p232
aa(lp233
VThis is an unnamed species of copepod. A copepod is a crustacean.
p234
aVThese copepods are a major constituent of the oceans,
p235
aVand they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales.
p236
aVWhat they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil
p237
aVhundreds of feet above the ocean, or how they got there,
p238
aVis completely unknown.
p239
aVThere are some interesting theories
p240
aVthat, if I had time, I would tell you about.
p241
aVBut as you go and you look closer at a tree,
p242
aVwhat you see is, you see increasing complexity.
p243
aVWe're looking at the very top of Gaya, which is thought to be the oldest Redwood.
p244
aVGaya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old,
p245
aVno one really knows, but its top has broken off
p246
aVand it's been rotting back now.
p247
aa(lp248
VThis little Japanese garden-like creation probably took 700 years
p249
aVto form in its complexity that we see right now.
p250
aVAs you look at a tree, it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree.
p251
aVI have to show you something unfortunately very sad
p252
aVat the conclusion of this talk.
p253
aVThe Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East.
p254
aVAnd we're moving in a full circle now.
p255
aVIn the 1950s, a small organism appeared in Richmond, Virginia,
p256
aVcalled the Hemlock woolly adelgid.
p257
aVIt made a trans-species jump out of some other organism in Asia,
p258
aVwhere it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia.
p259
aVWhen it moved into its new host, the Eastern Hemlock tree,
p260
aVit escaped its predators, and the new tree had no resistance to it.
p261
aVThe Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways
p262
aVthe last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River.
p263
aa(lp264
VI hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east,
p265
aVbut in Great Smoky Mountains National Park
p266
aVit can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year.
p267
aVAnd in the last two to three summers, these invasive organisms,
p268
aVthis kind of Ebola of the trees, as it were,
p269
aVhas swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east,
p270
aVand has absolutely wiped it out. I climbed there this past summer.
p271
aVThis is Great Smoky Mountains National Park,
p272
aVand the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see.
p273
aVAnd what we're seeing is not just the potential death
p274
aVof the Eastern Hemlock species \u2014
p275
aVthat is to say, its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite \u2014
p276
aVbut we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem
p277
aVfor which these trees are merely the substrate
p278
aVfor the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns.
p279
aa(lp280
VIt's absolutely heartbreaking to see.
p281
aVOne of the things that is just \u2014 I almost can't conceive it \u2014
p282
aVis the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all,
p283
aVand this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America.
p284
aVWhat can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves?
p285
aVWell, I think they can tell us something about human time.
p286
aVThe flickering, transitory quality of human time
p287
aVand the brevity of human life \u2014 the necessity to love.
p288
aVBut we're different from trees, and they can also teach us
p289
aVsomething about ourselves in the differences that we have.
p290
aVWe are human, and we have the capacity to love,
p291
aVwe have the capacity to wonder, and we have a sort of
p292
aVboundless curiosity, a restless inquisitiveness
p293
aVthat so suits us as primates, I think.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd at least for me, personally, the trees have taught me
p296
aVan entirely new way of loving my children.
p297
aVExploring with them the forest canopy
p298
aVhas been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth.
p299
aVAnd I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that
p300
aVwith my children I've been able to introduce them
p301
aVinto the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough,
p302
aVor possibly stupid enough, to still climb trees.
p303
aVThank you very much.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VChris Anderson: I think at a previous TED,
p308
aVI think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that
p309
aVbecause these trees are like, 2,000 years and older,
p310
aVon many of them there are ecosystems where there are species
p311
aVthat are not found anywhere on the Earth
p312
aVexcept on that one tree. Is that correct?
p313
aa(lp314
VRichard Preston: Yes, that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.
p315
aVAnd I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it, in 2006.
p316
aVAnd while we were climbing Hyperion, Marie Antoine spotted
p317
aVan unknown species of golden-brown ant about halfway up the trunk.
p318
aVAnts are not known to occur in Redwood trees, curiously enough,
p319
aVand we wondered whether this ant, this species of ant,
p320
aVwas only endemic to that one tree, or possibly to that grove.
p321
aVAnd in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again,
p322
aVand so no specimens have ever been collected.
p323
aVWe don't know what it is \u2014 we just know it's there.
p324
aa(lp325
VCA: So, you have to wonder when, you know,
p326
aVif some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth,
p327
aVyou know, our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip.
p328
aVYou've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening,
p329
aVand maybe whole ecosystems gone forever.
p330
aVIt's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me,
p331
aVand a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is.
p332
aa(lp333
VRP: It is fragile, and you know, I think about emerging human diseases \u2014
p334
aVparasites that move into the human species.
p335
aVBut that's just a very small facet
p336
aVof a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide,
p337
aVall through the ecosystems, and you know, the Earth itself \u2014
p338
aa(lp339
VCA: Partly caused by us, inadvertently.
p340
aa(lp341
VRP: Caused by humans. Caused by the movement of humans.
p342
aVYou can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace,
p343
aVand the continents are rooms in the palace,
p344
aVand the islands are small rooms.
p345
aVBut lately, the doors of the palace have been flung open,
p346
aVand the walls are coming down.
p347
aa(lp348
VCA: Richard Preston, thank you very much, I think.
p349
aa(lp350
VRP: Thank you.

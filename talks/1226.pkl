VLet's talk about billions.
p5
aVLet's talk about
p6
aVpast and future billions.
p7
aVWe know
p8
aVthat about 106 billion people
p9
aVhave ever lived.
p10
aVAnd we know that most of them are dead.
p11
aVAnd we also know
p12
aVthat most of them live or lived in Asia.
p13
aVAnd we also know
p14
aVthat most of them were or are very poor \u2014
p15
aVdid not live for very long.
p16
aVLet's talk about billions.
p17
aVLet's talk about
p18
aVthe 195,000 billion dollars of wealth
p19
aVin the world today.
p20
aVWe know that most of that wealth
p21
aVwas made after the year 1800.
p22
aVAnd we know that most of it
p23
aVis currently owned
p24
aVby people we might call Westerners:
p25
aVEuropeans, North Americans, Australasians.
p26
aV19 percent of the world's population today,
p27
aVWesterners own two-thirds of its wealth.
p28
aa(lp29
VEconomic historians
p30
aVcall this "The Great Divergence."
p31
aVAnd this slide here
p32
aVis the best simplification
p33
aVof the Great Divergence story
p34
aVI can offer you.
p35
aVIt's basically two ratios
p36
aVof per capita GDP,
p37
aVper capita gross domestic product,
p38
aVso average income.
p39
aVOne, the red line,
p40
aVis the ratio of British to Indian
p41
aVper capita income.
p42
aVAnd the blue line
p43
aVis the ratio of American to Chinese.
p44
aVAnd this chart goes back to 1500.
p45
aVAnd you can see here
p46
aVthat there's an exponential Great Divergence.
p47
aVThey start off pretty close together.
p48
aVIn fact, in 1500,
p49
aVthe average Chinese was richer than the average North American.
p50
aVWhen you get to the 1970s,
p51
aVwhich is where this chart ends,
p52
aVthe average Briton is more than 10 times richer
p53
aVthan the average Indian.
p54
aVAnd that's allowing
p55
aVfor differences in the cost of living.
p56
aVIt's based on purchasing power parity.
p57
aVThe average American
p58
aVis nearly 20 times richer
p59
aVthan the average Chinese
p60
aVby the 1970s.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo why?
p63
aVThis wasn't just an economic story.
p64
aVIf you take the 10 countries
p65
aVthat went on to become
p66
aVthe Western empires,
p67
aVin 1500 they were really quite tiny \u2014
p68
aVfive percent of the world's land surface,
p69
aV16 percent of its population,
p70
aVmaybe 20 percent of its income.
p71
aVBy 1913,
p72
aVthese 10 countries, plus the United States,
p73
aVcontrolled vast global empires \u2014
p74
aV58 percent of the world's territory,
p75
aVabout the same percentage of its population,
p76
aVand a really huge, nearly three-quarters share
p77
aVof global economic output.
p78
aVAnd notice, most of that went to the motherland,
p79
aVto the imperial metropoles,
p80
aVnot to their colonial possessions.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow you can't just blame this on imperialism \u2014
p83
aVthough many people have tried to do so \u2014
p84
aVfor two reasons.
p85
aVOne, empire was the least original thing
p86
aVthat the West did after 1500.
p87
aVEverybody did empire.
p88
aVThey beat preexisting Oriental empires
p89
aVlike the Mughals and the Ottomans.
p90
aVSo it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation
p91
aVfor the Great Divergence.
p92
aVIn any case, as you may remember,
p93
aVthe Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s,
p94
aVsome considerable time after decolonization.
p95
aVThis is not a new question.
p96
aa(lp97
VSamuel Johnson,
p98
aVthe great lexicographer,
p99
aV[posed] it through his character Rasselas
p100
aVin his novel "Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia,"
p101
aVpublished in 1759.
p102
aV"By what means are the Europeans thus powerful;
p103
aVor why, since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa
p104
aVfor trade or conquest,
p105
aVcannot the Asiaticks and Africans
p106
aVinvade their coasts,
p107
aVplant colonies in their ports,
p108
aVand give laws to their natural princes?
p109
aVThe same wind that carries them back
p110
aVwould bring us thither?"
p111
aa(lp112
VThat's a great question.
p113
aVAnd you know what,
p114
aVit was also being asked at roughly the same time
p115
aVby the Resterners \u2014 by the people in the rest of the world \u2014
p116
aVlike Ibrahim Muteferrika,
p117
aVan Ottoman official,
p118
aVthe man who introduced printing, very belatedly,
p119
aVto the Ottoman Empire \u2014
p120
aVwho said in a book published in 1731,
p121
aV"Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past
p122
aVcompared with Muslim nations
p123
aVbegin to dominate so many lands in modern times
p124
aVand even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies?"
p125
aVUnlike Rasselas,
p126
aVMuteferrika had an answer to that question,
p127
aVwhich was correct.
p128
aVHe said it was "because they have laws and rules
p129
aVinvented by reason."
p130
aVIt's not geography.
p131
aa(lp132
VYou may think we can explain the Great Divergence
p133
aVin terms of geography.
p134
aVWe know that's wrong,
p135
aVbecause we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century
p136
aVto see if geography mattered more than institutions.
p137
aVWe took all the Germans,
p138
aVwe divided them roughly in two,
p139
aVand we gave the ones in the East communism,
p140
aVand you see the result.
p141
aVWithin an incredibly short period of time,
p142
aVpeople living in the German Democratic Republic
p143
aVproduced Trabants, the Trabbi,
p144
aVone of the world's worst ever cars,
p145
aVwhile people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz.
p146
aVIf you still don't believe me,
p147
aVwe conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula.
p148
aVAnd we decided we'd take Koreans
p149
aVin roughly the same geographical place
p150
aVwith, notice, the same basic traditional culture,
p151
aVand we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.
p152
aVAnd the result is an even bigger divergence
p153
aVin a very short space of time
p154
aVthan happened in Germany.
p155
aVNot a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly,
p156
aVbut in almost every other respect,
p157
aVit's a huge divergence.
p158
aVWhich leads me to think
p159
aVthat neither geography nor national character,
p160
aVpopular explanations for this kind of thing,
p161
aVare really significant.
p162
aa(lp163
VIt's the ideas.
p164
aVIt's the institutions.
p165
aVThis must be true
p166
aVbecause a Scotsman said it.
p167
aVAnd I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED.
p168
aVSo let me just explain to you
p169
aVthat the smartest man ever was a Scotsman.
p170
aVHe was Adam Smith \u2014
p171
aVnot Billy Connolly, not Sean Connery \u2014
p172
aVthough he is very smart indeed.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVSmith \u2014 and I want you to go
p175
aVand bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile;
p176
aVit's a wonderful statue \u2014
p177
aVSmith, in the "Wealth of Nations"
p178
aVpublished in 1776 \u2014
p179
aVthat's the most important thing that happened that year ...
p180
aV(Laughter)
p181
aVYou bet.
p182
aVThere was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies, but ...
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
V"China seems to have been long stationary,
p187
aVand probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches
p188
aVwhich is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions.
p189
aVBut this complement may be much inferior
p190
aVto what, with other laws and institutions,
p191
aVthe nature of its soil, climate, and situation
p192
aVmight admit of."
p193
aVThat is so right and so cool.
p194
aVAnd he said it such a long time ago.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut you know, this is a TED audience,
p197
aVand if I keep talking about institutions,
p198
aVyou're going to turn off.
p199
aVSo I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand.
p200
aVLet's call them the killer apps.
p201
aVI want to explain to you that there were six killer apps
p202
aVthat set the West apart from the rest.
p203
aVAnd they're kind of like the apps on your phone,
p204
aVin the sense that they look quite simple.
p205
aVThey're just icons; you click on them.
p206
aVBut behind the icon, there's complex code.
p207
aVIt's the same with institutions.
p208
aVThere are six
p209
aVwhich I think explain the Great Divergence.
p210
aVOne, competition.
p211
aVTwo, the scientific revolution.
p212
aVThree, property rights.
p213
aVFour, modern medicine.
p214
aVFive, the consumer society.
p215
aVAnd six, the work ethic.
p216
aVYou can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at,
p217
aVor try and boil it down to just four,
p218
aVbut you'll lose.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VLet me very briefly tell you what I mean by this,
p223
aVsynthesizing the work of many economic historians
p224
aVin the process.
p225
aVCompetition means,
p226
aVnot only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500,
p227
aVbut within each of these units,
p228
aVthere was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns.
p229
aVThe ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation,
p230
aVexisted in the 12th century.
p231
aVNothing like this existed in China,
p232
aVwhere there was one monolithic state
p233
aVcovering a fifth of humanity,
p234
aVand anyone with any ambition
p235
aVhad to pass one standardized examination,
p236
aVwhich took three days and was very difficult
p237
aVand involved memorizing vast numbers of characters
p238
aVand very complex Confucian essay writing.
p239
aa(lp240
VThe scientific revolution was different
p241
aVfrom the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world
p242
aVin a number of crucial ways,
p243
aVthe most important being
p244
aVthat, through the experimental method,
p245
aVit gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before.
p246
aVExample: Benjamin Robins's extraordinary application
p247
aVof Newtonian physics to ballistics.
p248
aVOnce you do that,
p249
aVyour artillery becomes accurate.
p250
aVThink of what that means.
p251
aVThat really was a killer application.
p252
aV(Laughter)
p253
aVMeanwhile, there's no scientific revolution anywhere else.
p254
aVThe Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe,
p255
aVbut there's no scientific revolution there.
p256
aVIn fact, they demolish Taqi al-Din's observatory,
p257
aVbecause it's considered blasphemous
p258
aVto inquire into the mind of God.
p259
aa(lp260
VProperty rights: It's not the democracy, folks;
p261
aVit's having the rule of law based on private property rights.
p262
aVThat's what makes the difference
p263
aVbetween North America and South America.
p264
aVYou could turn up in North America
p265
aVhaving signed a deed of indenture
p266
aVsaying, "I'll work for nothing for five years.
p267
aVYou just have to feed me."
p268
aVBut at the end of it, you've got a hundred acres of land.
p269
aVThat's the land grant
p270
aVon the bottom half of the slide.
p271
aVThat's not possible in Latin America
p272
aVwhere land is held onto
p273
aVby a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors.
p274
aVAnd you can see here the huge divergence
p275
aVthat happens in property ownership between North and South.
p276
aVMost people in rural North America
p277
aVowned some land by 1900.
p278
aVHardly anyone in South America did.
p279
aVThat's another killer app.
p280
aa(lp281
VModern medicine in the late 19th century
p282
aVbegan to make major breakthroughs
p283
aVagainst the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people.
p284
aVAnd this was another killer app \u2014
p285
aVthe very opposite of a killer,
p286
aVbecause it doubled, and then more than doubled, human life expectancy.
p287
aVIt even did that
p288
aVin the European empires.
p289
aVEven in places like Senegal,
p290
aVbeginning in the early 20th century,
p291
aVthere were major breakthroughs in public health,
p292
aVand life expectancy began to rise.
p293
aVIt doesn't rise any faster
p294
aVafter these countries become independent.
p295
aVThe empires weren't all bad.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe consumer society is what you need
p298
aVfor the Industrial Revolution to have a point.
p299
aVYou need people to want to wear tons of clothes.
p300
aVYou've all bought an article of clothing in the last month;
p301
aVI guarantee it.
p302
aVThat's the consumer society,
p303
aVand it propels economic growth
p304
aVmore than even technological change itself.
p305
aVJapan was the first non-Western society
p306
aVto embrace it.
p307
aVThe alternative,
p308
aVwhich was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi,
p309
aVwas to institutionalize and make poverty permanent.
p310
aVVery few Indians today
p311
aVwish that India had gone down
p312
aVMahatma Gandhi's road.
p313
aa(lp314
VFinally, the work ethic.
p315
aVMax Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.
p316
aVHe was wrong.
p317
aVAny culture can get the work ethic
p318
aVif the institutions are there
p319
aVto create the incentive to work.
p320
aVWe know this
p321
aVbecause today the work ethic
p322
aVis no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon.
p323
aVIn fact, the West has lost its work ethic.
p324
aVToday, the average Korean
p325
aVworks a thousand hours more a year
p326
aVthan the average German \u2014
p327
aVa thousand.
p328
aVAnd this is part
p329
aVof a really extraordinary phenomenon,
p330
aVand that is the end of the Great Divergence.
p331
aa(lp332
VWho's got the work ethic now?
p333
aVTake a look at mathematical attainment
p334
aVby 15 year-olds.
p335
aVAt the top of the international league table
p336
aVaccording to the latest PISA study,
p337
aVis the Shanghai district of China.
p338
aVThe gap between Shanghai
p339
aVand the United Kingdom and the United States
p340
aVis as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S.
p341
aVand Albania and Tunisia.
p342
aVYou probably assume
p343
aVthat because the iPhone was designed in California
p344
aVbut assembled in China
p345
aVthat the West still leads in terms of technological innovation.
p346
aVYou're wrong.
p347
aVIn terms of patents,
p348
aVthere's no question that the East is ahead.
p349
aVNot only has Japan been ahead for some time,
p350
aVSouth Korea has gone into third place,
p351
aVand China is just about to overtake Germany.
p352
aVWhy?
p353
aVBecause the killer apps can be downloaded.
p354
aVIt's open source.
p355
aVAny society can adopt these institutions,
p356
aVand when they do,
p357
aVthey achieve what the West achieved after 1500 \u2014
p358
aVonly faster.
p359
aa(lp360
VThis is the Great Reconvergence,
p361
aVand it's the biggest story of your lifetime.
p362
aVBecause it's on your watch that this is happening.
p363
aVIt's our generation
p364
aVthat is witnessing the end of Western predominance.
p365
aVThe average American used to be more than 20 times richer
p366
aVthan the average Chinese.
p367
aVNow it's just five times,
p368
aVand soon it will be 2.5 times.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo I want to end with three questions
p371
aVfor the future billions,
p372
aVjust ahead of 2016,
p373
aVwhen the United States will lose its place
p374
aVas number one economy to China.
p375
aVThe first is, can you delete these apps,
p376
aVand are we in the process of doing so
p377
aVin the Western world?
p378
aVThe second question is,
p379
aVdoes the sequencing of the download matter?
p380
aVAnd could Africa get that sequencing wrong?
p381
aVOne obvious implication of modern economic history
p382
aVis that it's quite hard to transition to democracy
p383
aVbefore you've established
p384
aVsecure private property rights.
p385
aVWarning: that may not work.
p386
aVAnd third, can China do without
p387
aVkiller app number three?
p388
aVThat's the one that John Locke systematized
p389
aVwhen he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights
p390
aVand the protection of law.
p391
aVThat's the basis
p392
aVfor the Western model
p393
aVof representative government.
p394
aVNow this picture shows the demolition
p395
aVof the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio
p396
aVin Shanghai earlier this year.
p397
aVHe's now free again,
p398
aVhaving been detained, as you know, for some time.
p399
aVBut I don't think his studio has been rebuilt.
p400
aa(lp401
VWinston Churchill once defined civilization
p402
aVin a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938.
p403
aVAnd I think these words really nail it:
p404
aV"It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians.
p405
aVIt means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs,
p406
aVthe conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny,
p407
aVgive place to parliaments where laws are made,
p408
aVand independent courts of justice
p409
aVin which over long periods those laws are maintained.
p410
aVThat is civilization \u2014
p411
aVand in its soil grow continually
p412
aVfreedom, comfort and culture,"
p413
aVwhat all TEDsters care about most.
p414
aV"When civilization reigns in any country,
p415
aVa wider and less harassed life
p416
aVis afforded to the masses of the people."
p417
aVThat's so true.
p418
aa(lp419
VI don't think the decline of Western civilization
p420
aVis inevitable,
p421
aVbecause I don't think history operates
p422
aVin this kind of life-cycle model,
p423
aVbeautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's
p424
aV"Course of Empire" paintings.
p425
aVThat's not the way history works.
p426
aVThat's not the way the West rose,
p427
aVand I don't think it's the way the West will fall.
p428
aVThe West may collapse very suddenly.
p429
aVComplex civilizations do that,
p430
aVbecause they operate, most of the time,
p431
aVon the edge of chaos.
p432
aVThat's one of the most profound insights
p433
aVto come out of the historical study of complex institutions
p434
aVlike civilizations.
p435
aVNo, we may hang on,
p436
aVdespite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated,
p437
aVdespite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic
p438
aVand other parts of our historical mojo.
p439
aVBut one thing is for sure,
p440
aVthe Great Divergence
p441
aVis over, folks.
p442
aa(lp443
VThanks very much.
p444
aa(lp445
V(Applause)
p446
aa(lp447
VBruno Giussani: Niall,
p448
aVI am just curious
p449
aVabout your take on the other region of the world that's booming,
p450
aVwhich is Latin America.
p451
aVWhat's your view on that?
p452
aa(lp453
VNiall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talking
p454
aVabout the rise of the East;
p455
aVI'm talking about the rise of the Rest,
p456
aVand that includes South America.
p457
aVI once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard,
p458
aV"Hey, is South America part of the West?"
p459
aVHe was an expert in Latin American history.
p460
aVHe said, "I don't know; I'll have to think about that."
p461
aVThat tells you something really important.
p462
aVI think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular,
p463
aVbut also Chile,
p464
aVwhich was in many ways the one that led the way
p465
aVin transforming the institutions of economic life,
p466
aVthere's a very bright future indeed.
p467
aVSo my story really is
p468
aVas much about that convergence in the Americas
p469
aVas it's a convergence story in Eurasia.
p470
aa(lp471
VBG: And there is this impression
p472
aVthat North America and Europe
p473
aVare not really paying attention
p474
aVto these trends.
p475
aVMostly they're worried about each other.
p476
aVThe Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow.
p477
aVThe Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow.
p478
aVAnd that's all we seem to be caring about recently.
p479
aa(lp480
VNF: I think the fiscal crisis
p481
aVthat we see in the developed World right now \u2014 both sides of the Atlantic \u2014
p482
aVis essentially the same thing
